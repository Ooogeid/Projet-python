5
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,325
Damn.

9
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:49,224
- they woke you too?
- yep.

10
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:51,643
You know
that big yoni guy
uses my toilet?

11
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,612
- yep.
- and he leaves floaters!

12
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,914
- i didn't know that.
- what are we gonna do?

13
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,317
Talk to aaron.
i called him, he's on his way.

14
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,453
- you seen my fruit loops?
- nope.

15
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,256
Big yoni's
eating them outside.

16

<i>- turtle: this guy's
pushing me.
- bagel broker.</i>

17
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,395
- nice!
- what is with your face?

18
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:13,799
They surprised me
with a new scene when i got
to the set last night--

19
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,568
Battery acid sprays
out of my car engine.

20
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:21,473
Four hours
of makeup for one line,
compliments of dan coakley.

21
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:24,343
- why didn't you take it off?
- i've got to shoot
again tonight.

22
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,578
I can't bear
another session
in the makeup chair.

23
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,348
- now you've got two bad sides.
- don't start with me, turtle.

24
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,150
- i'm exhausted.
- oh, you are?!

25
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:34,019
We've got the israeli army
waking us up all night
and you can go home!

26
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,104
Baby bro was hungry
and you can go to jamie's.

27
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:39,541
- i'm a friend who doesn't
leave his boy in crisis.
- appreciate that, turtle.

28
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,693
Since jamie's
a little too scared
to sleep here,

29
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,562
I'm having a little
crisis of my own.

30
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:46,465
You've gone
years without pussy,
a couple days won't kill you.

31
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,201
- shut your mouth, acid face!
- you want to go?

32
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,270
- yeah, i do!
- don't fucking get in my face.

33
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,372
- whoa whoa whoa!
- you're disgusting.

34
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,774
- you boys okay?
- actually no, we're not.

35
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:59,077
- he started it.
- one of your goons
ate my fruit loops.

36
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,446
The same goon keeps
pummeling my toilet.

37
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,383
- i'm sorry.  i'll talk to him.
- and i thought your man outside

38
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,818
Was gonna shoot me
when i pulled up
this morning.

39
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,755
- it's makeup.
- aaron, i think everyone's
a little tense

40
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,057
With all the people
around the house constantly.

41
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,726
How much longer do you
think we're gonna have
this much security?

42
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,795
I can scale it back
if that's what you want.

43
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:21,049
But i think you should hear
what we found on this guy
before you make that decision.

44
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:25,854
- here's a report.
he has a few arrests.
- he tried to kill his father?

45
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,323
As a child, he had
an affinity for setting fires.

46
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:30,709
At the age of 12,
he burned down his house,

47
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:33,779
Badly injuring his father.
he was questioned and cleared.

48
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,864
- jesus.
- creepy.

49
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,951
- we'll keep the security.
- it shouldn't be
for much longer.

50
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:42,004
We have this guy
under 24-hour surveillance.

51
00:03:42,038 --> 00:03:44,389
<i>- so what should we do?
- what you normally do.</i>

52
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,626
<i>- well, i have a fitting today.
- no worries.</i>

53
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,780
Live your life as usual.
my guys will be there just
in case of any surprises.

54
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,182
- i'll be there too, bro.
- appreciate it, johnny.

55
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:57,069
- but lose the makeup, huh?
- no can do.

56
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,321
Okay.  turtle,
you want to come also?

57
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:02,124
- i got class.
- so much for you
being a good friend.

58
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,394
- i have a perfect
attendance record.
- it's okay, you go to class.

59
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:07,763
But do me a favor, call e,
have him to meet me there

60
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:10,832
- because it looks
like i have a ride.
- you got it, boss.

61
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,704
( phone ringing )

62
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,691
Hello?

63
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:21,710
<i>- yo, wake up.
- what time is it?</i>

64
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:23,428
<i>i don't know, 7-something.</i>

65
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,597
<i>- are you alone?
- no.</i>

66
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,866
<i>- ashley?
- who else?</i>

67
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:32,020
- with you, who knows?
- she wake you up with
a morning b.j., e?

68
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:34,473
<i>- eric: what's up?
- drama: tell her she should.</i>

69
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:35,891
What's up?

70
00:04:35,925 --> 00:04:38,176
Vince wanted me to tell you
to meet him at the fitting.

71
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,296
- sounds good.
- not as good as a morning b.j.

72
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:43,632
Okay, i gotta go.
i'll talk to you later.

73
00:04:45,217 --> 00:04:48,387
- who was that?
- it was turtle.

74
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:51,106
Oh, what did he want?

75
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,909
Just to tell me that i have
to meet vince at the fitting.

76
00:04:53,943 --> 00:04:55,627
I gotta get up.

77
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,896
Eric, was that...

78
00:04:57,914 --> 00:05:00,182
Really turtle?

79
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:02,334
Yeah, why?

80
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,936
'cause you were talking
really weird on the phone.

81
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,606
- weird?
- cryptic, short answers,

82
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,308
Like you were
hiding something.

83
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,710
I wasn't hiding anything.
you want to know the truth?

84
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:13,512
Yeah.

85
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:16,631
Well, he was saying
some stupid things,
that's why.

86
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,084
Like what?

87
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:21,853
- like drama wanted to know
if you woke me up--
- wait, drama?

88
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,740
- i thought it was turtle.
- drama got on the phone
and he wanted to know

89
00:05:24,774 --> 00:05:27,242
If you woke me up
with a-- you know.

90
00:05:27,276 --> 00:05:29,561
- you know.
- ahh.

91
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,646
He's an idiot that's why
i was being cryptic.

92
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,900
I hate when my friends do
stuff like that.  i'm sorry,
i don't mean to be crazy.

93
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,602
Don't be sorry.
i gotta jump in the shower.

94
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,454
( groans )

95
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,319
<i>- i know it's annoying, vinnie.
- do you?</i>

96
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,722
Two guys following
behind me, my every move.

97
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:59,991
You usually have three.
the only difference is your
idiots aren't armed.

98
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,095
- you're always a help, ari.
- i'm sorry, vinnie.
it'll be over soon.

99
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,396
- enjoy darabont.
- i will.

100
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,764
<i>- later.
- later.</i>

101
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,766
<i>- lloyd: morning, mr. gold.
- morning, slave.</i>

102
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,735
I trust you heard that
adam davies was promoted

103
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,870
- to the head of his
talent department.
- i did.

104
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,206
And i was preparing
to send him feces.

105
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,475
- no?
- no, but i like
the proactive thought.

106
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,044
- just get him on the phone
and zac too.
- zac who?

107
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:22,480
Zac who-you-don't-
get-to-know-his-name-
because-you-are-a-peasant.

108
00:06:22,498 --> 00:06:24,332
Oh good god,
abs alert.

109
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:27,002
Don't whack off to
the sound of his voice.
chop chop.

110
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:29,621
What could you
possibly want, ari?

111
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,606
I just wanted
to congratulate you

112
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,708
On making it
to the top of the gestapo.

113
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:35,710
You really want anything?

114
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:39,047
- no, but your ex-client does.
- what ex-client?

115
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:43,034
- connect him, lloyd!
- mr. efron, you're on with
mr. gold and mr. davies.

116
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,771
- hello.
- ...zac!

117
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,222
Buddy, what's up?

118
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,974
You think you can
leverage me, adam?

119
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,693
<i>- what are you talking about?
- you promised disney</i>

120
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:53,862
I'd do a shirtless lunchbox
if they gave the rock

121
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:57,532
<i>- an extra five mil
for "witch 2."

122
00:06:57,567 --> 00:06:59,801
<i>- no, it's not happening.
- davies: zac,</i>

123
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,170
<i>- that was a joke.
- you're a joke.</i>

124
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:04,739
- hold on, adam.
- my girl here is
a really big fan.

125
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:07,309
- right?
- hi, can i please

126
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,879

<i>- zac, are you there?

00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:24,092
<i>- are you still there, adam?
- yep.</i>

132
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:25,727
Good.

<i>i'm with ari now.

00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,919
Beautiful work, zac,
beautiful.

136
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,887
<i>you are now my new
favorite client.</i>

137
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:39,157
I cannot wait
to get you a producer credit
on "college musical."

138
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,426
That's hilarious, ari.
how about a signing present?

139
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,562
Something with four wheels
and leather seats.

140
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,597
Consider it done,
my friend.  later.

141
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,467
- later.
- i'd buy that lunchbox,
by the way.

142
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,937
I'm really
sorry.

143
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,872
Ashley doesn't
trust me.

144
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:56,808
I never had a girl
that trusted me.
it sucks.

145
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,144
Yeah, but e's as
trustworthy as they get.

146
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,913
- he's like a toyota.
- i did lie to her about
sloan calling me.

147
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,316
<i>- look, e, do you really
like this girl?
- yeah, i do.</i>

148
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,585
Then you're gonna have
to earn back her trust.

149
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,087
Never happen.
girls have memories
like elephants.

150
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:12,591
You get caught lying once,
you're done, no matter
what they tell you.

151
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,993
- what do you know
about relationships?
- everything.

152
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,796
I agree with vince.
i think if you're a good guy
you can prove it.

153
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,464
- thank you.

160
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,180
I'm so excited.
i really want to get
back to work.

161
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,549
You and me both.
the sets are almost
completely rebuilt.

162
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,484
<i>- ( phone rings )
- they're real--
who are these guys?</i>

163
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,553
<i>eric:
oh, we're having a bit
of a security issue.</i>

164
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,221
Don't worry, it won't
affect the movie.

165
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,823
<i>- mr. chase?
- yeah?</i>

166
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,292
That was aaron.
we momentarily lost track
of our target.

167
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,529
- he would like you to come
back home for the time being.
- how do you lose a tail?

168
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,731
It's okay.
i'll finish up
the fitting.

169
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,200
- nothing's going to happen.
- whoa whoa whoa.

170
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:59,237
- vince, what's going on?
- i think i might have
a stalker.

171
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,439
<i>- eric: we don't know that yet.
- a stalker?</i>

172
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,008
Not good, man, listen,

173
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,011
After "shawshank" came out,
i got all these letters
from convicts--

174
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,580
Most very complimentary,
but there was this one guy,

175
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:11,349
Sent me like 50 letters
saying that when he got out

176
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,085
He was going to
shawshank me in the ass.

177
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,820
Who couldn't
love that movie?

178
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,689
- so what happened?
- the guy got paroled.

179
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,591
Sure enough, one day
he shows up on my doorstep.

180
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,259
- jesus.
- what'd you do?

181
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:23,995
- i shot him.
- ( laughs ) oh, frank.

182
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,964
No no, i'm serious.
i shot him in the ass.

183
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,066
- here.
- hey hey hey.

184
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,069
- it's okay, he's a director.
- relax, fellas, i know
what i'm doing.

185
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,772
Safety's on, take this one.
i got a whole bunch
more at home.

186
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,807
Oh no, we've already had
a bit of a gun issue.

187
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,876
- really?
- it was turtle's fault.

188
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,712
- you sure?
- yes, thank you.

189
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,181
All right, but i'm
telling you something:

190
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,951
Shit like this is not to be
trifled with, my friend.

191
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,219
My advice to you,
listen to your israelis.

192
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,889
Go home.
we can always do this fitting
some other time, yeah?

193
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,159
- i could finish this
up at the house.
- vince?

194
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:57,128
- at the house will be fine.
- wonderful.  at the house
is fine.

195
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,331
Good, thank you, fellas.
thank you, everybody.

196
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:02,901
Vince, seriously,
paranoia.

197
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,704
That's all i'm saying.

198
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,639
Yeah.

199
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:15,180
- ( phone rings )
- ari gold's office.

200
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:18,083
- lloyd, it's adam davies.
- oh-- hi.

201
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,651
Uh, let me see
if i can get mr. gold.

202
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,353
<i>i'm not calling
for ari, lloyd.</i>

203
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,689
- i'm calling for you.
- oh.

204
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,125
- are you happy there?
- happy?

205
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,160
<i>how would you like
to come work for me?</i>

206
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,630
How would you like
to finally be an agent?

207
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,649
<i>- would this be just so you
could get back at ari?
- no, lloyd.</i>

208
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:36,551
Getting back at ari
is the bonus.

209
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:39,688
<i>- that's not great
motivation for me.
- three-year contract.</i>

210
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,623
Triple what you're making,
i'm sure.

211
00:10:41,657 --> 00:10:43,558
<i>come in, we'll discuss.</i>

212
00:10:43,592 --> 00:10:45,327
I'm sorry,
but i can't do that.

213
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:48,463
If that's a personal call
you're on, lloyd, i'm going
to waterboard you.

214
00:10:48,497 --> 00:10:50,265
- i have to go.
- who was that?

215
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:53,201
<i>- my mother.
- andrew: ari!</i>

216
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:56,371
Aaron sorkin is signed,
sealed and delivered.

217
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,473
Beautiful!
you hear that, lloyd?

218
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:01,409
- yes, congratulations.
- now take a good look
at this man.

219
00:11:01,444 --> 00:11:05,280
All right, now what do you
see in him that you don't
see in yourself?

220
00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:07,716
I don't know.

221
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,250
- a purpose.
- ( andrew laughs )

222
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:11,419
Now call your mother and tell
her that you don't have one.

223
00:11:11,454 --> 00:11:13,054
- all right?  lunch?
- great.

224
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,340
Slave, call the grill and tell
them we're on our way.

225
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:21,179
<i>- ( phone rings )
- ari gold's office.</i>

226
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:25,250
- have you
reconsidered yet, lloyd?
- i'm happy here, really.

227
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,852
This offer won't
last forever.

228
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,255
<i>tick tock.</i>

229
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:37,028
How can i be calm when
baby bro's safety is in
the hands of inept gorillas?

230
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,764
- please control your man, eric.
- would you calm down, please?

231
00:11:39,798 --> 00:11:43,268
No, i can't calm down when
we're locked up in here
like wild animals.

232
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,937
You're not locked up.
you're free to leave
whenever you want.

233
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:49,074
I don't get why you
just didn't have this guy
arrested in the first place.

234
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,359
'cause we have
no actual proof
it was him who broke in.

235
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,845
Then you should have had
your goons stick hhoin the trunk

236
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,414
- and give him an
israeli-type warning.
- you watch too much tv!

237
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,950
Drama, would you let
the professionals do
their jobs, please?

238
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,136
Fine.
do your job.

239
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,938
Thank you.
so what does this guy
do anyway?

240
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,909
- he works in a retail shop.
- which one?  maybe we've
crossed paths with him before.

241
00:12:07,943 --> 00:12:11,746
Do you spend a lot
of time in a place called
the pleasure chest?

242
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,133
- great mother of god.
- he does.

243
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:18,353
Do you have any idea how sick
this guy must be if he works
at the pleasure chest?

244
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:20,939
Why?  you used
to spend more time there
than the employees.

245
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,508
Yeah, so what?
he's a stalker, i'm not.

246
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:27,712
And he has an unlimited access
to dildoes and restraints
and this guy lost him!

247
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,981
<i>but we have vince
which is most important.</i>

248
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,950
I'm not feeling
like you have anything.

249
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,068
You want me to make
you feel something?

250
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,021
<i>- guys.
- fine fine.</i>

251
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:40,141
I'll let
the professionals
do their job.

252
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,810
I'm gonna go take a nap.

253
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,212
That one is
a loose cannon.

254
00:12:47,616 --> 00:12:51,252
( rings )

255
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,238
Pleasure chest,
this is sadie.

256
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,473
Hey, sadie, i don't know
if you remember me?

257
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:59,310
I don't remember you,
i won't have phone sex with you
and i'm a lesbian.

258
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,712
<i>- no no no, this is
johnny chase.  we--
- drama?</i>

259
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,815
- yeah!
- holy shit, man.
how are you?

260
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:07,035
<i>- good good.
- haven't seen you sinceou
made it big on the network.</i>

261
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:09,254
<i>yeah, well, i can't really
be rolling in there</i>

262
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,389
<i>- now that i'm a public figure.
- ( moaning )</i>

263
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:13,792
( scoffs )
jeez, drama, turn down
the porn, will ya?

264
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,194
- ( moaning )
- no, that's not porn.

265
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,947
- it's vince.
- oh, guess he's good.

266
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,783
<i>- yeah, he's great.
- sweet.  so what's up?</i>

267
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,452
Look, i wanted to ask you about
an employee-- curtis tucker.

268
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:26,638
<i>- what about him?
- what do you know about him?</i>

269
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,407
Not much.
quiet, keeps to himself.

270
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:32,210
- why?
- i think he's got a hard-on
for my baby'sro.

271
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,678
( snickers )
who doesn't?

272
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:36,514
No, not that kind of a hard-on.
more of a stalkerish nature.

273
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,184
Yeah, it wouldn't shock me.
kid is creepy.

274
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,419
<i>- have you seen him?
- not since yesterday, no.</i>

275
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,522
But i think he switched shifts
so he should be around
at, like, 4:00.

276
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,508
Great.
maybe i'll be there too.

277
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:49,060
You're not going
to cause trouble,
now are you, drama?

278
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:52,363
- would you like it if i did?
- you know it.

279
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,315
Although i am still
recovering from you

280
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,484
Dislocating my pinkie
at that s&m seminar.

281
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,304
( laughs )
maybe i'll make it
up to you.  ciao.

282
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,991
Hey.

283
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:03,992
Hey.

284
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,544
- hey.
- everything fit okay?

285
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,546
- yeah.
- i gotta run to the set.

286
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,548
- okay.
- i thought you were
taking a nap?

287
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,834
<i>- later!
- later.</i>

288
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:17,105
Tom, i don't know if it's
a real offer or not.  i'm just
telling you what was said.

289
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:18,439
Lloyd!

290
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:20,508
- i gotta go.
- lloyd!

291
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:22,727
Coming, mr. gold.

292
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,630
- yes, sir.
- i just spilled water
all over my keyboard.

293
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:28,833
- why?
- because you were so busy, you
accidentally knocked it over

294
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:33,004
No, because the only water
that is available is in
these stupid little cups.

295
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,672
No bottles.
where are the bottles?

296
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,775
In the landfill.
you said you wanted
to be more green.

297
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,878
That's because leo
was in earshot.

298
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:43,248
- i will switch out
your keyboard right away.
- good.

299
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:46,284
Wait till i'm out of the office
before you get on your knees.

300
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:50,388
<i>- ari-- mr. gold.
- what?</i>

301
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,192
- you know it's been 50 days.
- 50 days.

302
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:58,830
You said 100 days of hell
and then i'd be an agent.
it's been 50.

303
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:01,432
So i just want to make sure
we're still on track.

304
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:06,421
- still on track?
- that nothing's changed?

305
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:08,806
Are you seriously
questioning me?

306
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,911
I'm just asking.
because today i was
offered a job.

307
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,415
<i>- you were offered a job?
- a real job, ari.</i>

308
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:20,218
To be an agent,
which of course is what
i've always wanted--

309
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,787
But to be an agent for you!
so i just want to make sure

310
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,689
That i'm still going
to be in 50 days.

311
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,291
- i just added 10 days.
- ari, no!

312
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,059
10 more!
you want to keep
questioning me?

313
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,995
- ari, i just--
- or keep telling me about
your other job opportunities.

314
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,532
- ari!
- it's "mr. gold"
for 70-- now 80!

315
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,334
<i>or you can go ahead
and represent</i>

316
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,803
Dancing chihuahuas
or whatever your offer is.

317
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,805
Go ahead,
keep questioning me.
i dare you.

318
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,690
- please.
- 90 days.

319
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:45,426
This is not
"the breakfast club,"
mr. gold, this is my life.

320
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:47,996
100 days.
you want 10 more?

321
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,431
- you just got them.
- for what?

322
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:52,233
For what you
were thinking.

323
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:55,486
Now i've got chores for you
when you're done cleaning up
my keyboard.

324
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,990
Get my car, have it washed.
go get my dry cleaning,
bring it to my house,

325
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,559
Clean up all the dogshit
and my neighbor's.

326
00:16:01,577 --> 00:16:04,245
<i>don't you ever question
my word again!</i>

327
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,133
- go.
- yes, sir.

328
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,438
<i>- what do you mean
they lost him?
- drama: just what i said.</i>

329
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,341
Now they're
following me around
as if i'm the problem.

330
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,343
<i>- am i supposed to go home?
- no no no.</i>

331
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,178
I got the situation
under control.

332
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,813
( giggling )

333
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,215
I'm sure you do.
did i look weird today?

334
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,417
Like i memorize you
every morning.

335
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,419
What do you need, drama?

336
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,154
I need you to call the house,

337
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,223
Tell cohn that you need
a man with you.

338
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,492
- why?
- so i can give this perv

339
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,561
A good old-fashioned
new york warning.

340
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,329
- i--
- hey.

341
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,831
- i'm brooke.
- hi.

342
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,133
<i>- turtle, are you
listening to me?
- yes.</i>

343
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,502
- i have a homework question.
- are you in my class?

344
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,904
No.
i'll ask you later.

345
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:50,041
- ask me what?
- turtle, will you stop
sializing and call aaron?

346
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:53,177
<i>do you really want to sit
around and wait for this guy
to come to us?</i>

347
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:56,347
- what the hell?
- is that what we are--
passive pussies?

348
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,783
My break's over.
i've got to get to class.

349
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:01,753
<i>- come on, turtle!
- fine!  later.</i>

350
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,455
I'm coming as soon as
your car is washed.

351
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,258
- you haven't done that yet?
- it's only been 30 minutes,
mr. gold.

352
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,726
I'm moving
as fast as i can.

353
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,095
If you would have dropped
the weight like i told you to,

354
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,830
You'd be a little mo aerody.

355
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,900
I wanted to do it last so it
was as fresh as possible.

356
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,102
Jesus christ,
10 more days.

357
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,671
- ari, why?
- because you're weak, lloyd.

358
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,374
<i>- i am not.
- don't cry.</i>

359
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,326
- i am not crying!
- because i will add

360
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,962
A whole new lifetime
if you start crying.

361
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:31,099
- i am not crying, ari.
- it's "mr. gold."

362
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,701
I'm not fucking crying,
mr. gold!

363
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:35,670
<i>( shouts )
oh my god!</i>

364
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:37,338
- what happened?
- i've been hit.

365
00:17:37,372 --> 00:17:39,474
<i>- what?
- you've been hit--
rear-ended.</i>

366
00:17:39,508 --> 00:17:40,942
<i>- oh god.
- jesus christ!</i>

367
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,411
- are you kidding me?!
- ari, it wasn't my fault.

368
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:46,280
- everything is your fault.
- it's your fault

369
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,683
Because you accused me
of crying when i wasn't

370
00:17:48,717 --> 00:17:50,485
And accused me
of being weak
when i'm not!

371
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:53,254
You're blaming me for you
crashing my car?

372
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:56,557
<i>- i'm blaming you
for ruining my life!
- ( honking )</i>

373
00:17:56,592 --> 00:18:00,094
Get your ass back here
before you say something
you're going to regret.

374
00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:02,530
I regret ever having
met you, ari gold.

375
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:05,733
Your car is on wilshire
and crescent waiting for you.

376
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:09,370
- you're abandoning it?!
- yes, and i'm abandoning you!

377
00:18:09,404 --> 00:18:12,373
<i>- lloyd?  lloyd!
- ( honking )</i>

378
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:14,041
( screams )
lloyd!

379
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,998
Johnny drama.

380
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,835
Hey, sadie,
good to see you.

381
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,654
You too.
what's up with your face?

382
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,924
- it's makeup.
- sexy.

383
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,393
- is he here yet?
- no, not yet.

384
00:18:32,427 --> 00:18:34,712
- why don't you browse?
- cool.

385
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,948
I'll be in bondage.

386
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:39,817
I'll sneak away
when i can.

387
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,522
You want
to double tonight?

388
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,223
With who?
you and the clothing girl?

389
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:48,326
- she's cool.
- you've known her
for 20 minutes.

390
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,461
- how do you know?
- good instincts.

391
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:54,031
I think i gotta go alone.
i've got some work
to do with ashley.

392
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:57,301
<i>- ( phone ringing )
- speaking of which.</i>

393
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,788
Are your ears burning?
we were talking about you.

394
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,957
<i>- where are you?
- i'm at vince's.</i>

395
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,075
I thought you were gonna be
at the office all day.

396
00:19:05,093 --> 00:19:07,628
Yeah, i thought so too,
but something came up.
where are you?

397
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,347
<i>- at your office.
- oh.</i>

398
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:12,082
<i>- i wanted to surprise you.
- oh, i'm sorry.</i>

399
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,052
I met your assistant.

400
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:17,188
Vince, we've got
a problem.

401
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,256
There's a problem here.
can i call you back?

402
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:21,042
Um... yeah, sure!

403
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,777
<i>- bye.
- what happened?</i>

404
00:19:22,811 --> 00:19:24,779
Your crazy brother is
inside the pleasure chest.

405
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:27,899
We've got sight of our
main suspect.  he's pulling
up there right now.

406
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,785
<i>- i'm gonna call him.
- no no, i'll call him.</i>

407
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,438
<i>( cell phone ringing )</i>

408
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,226
Hey, curtis.

409
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,994
All right.
what's going on?

410
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,065
Hello, curtis, how are you?

411
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,267
I'm okay.
do i know you?

412
00:19:46,301 --> 00:19:48,135
I don't know,
do you?

413
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,937
You look
kind of familiar.

414
00:19:49,972 --> 00:19:53,608
Walk with me, curtis.
i'd like to ask you
a few questions.

415
00:19:53,642 --> 00:19:56,544
- all right, thanks.
i'll email you.
- all right, later.

416
00:19:56,578 --> 00:19:58,412
Hey!
sorry.

417
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,914
What's up?

418
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,949
I don't really have
a homework question.

419
00:20:01,984 --> 00:20:03,851
No, you just like
to laugh at me?

420
00:20:03,886 --> 00:20:06,354
I haven't been
laughing at you.
they have.

421
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:08,356
I think
you're really cute.

422
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,391
- really?
- yeah.

423
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:14,145
- so why are they
laughing at me?
- they know things.

424
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,548
- like what?
- like that you live
in quite the house.

425
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,718
- how do they know that?
- 1250 north crossroads drive.

426
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,620
What's that about?

427
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,256
- i have a roommate.
- and a dog.

428
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,425
And you prefer
boxers to briefs.

429
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,060
What the hell
is going on!

430
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,562
They're all wearing
your underwear.

431
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,532
- see?
- whoo!

432
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:38,569
Our rush chairman told us we had
to steal jamie-lynn sigler's
boyfriend's underwear.

433
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,805
Sorry.

434
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:44,075
- you broke in and stole
my underwear?
- no, not me.

435
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,477
I only wear thongs.

436
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,650
- vincent chase!
- vincent chase.

437
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,052
- what about him?
- admit it, you were
at his house.

438
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,954
- i wasn't.
- you were.

439
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,557
<i>- and i found your
license to prove it.
- ( phone ringing )</i>

440
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,859
I lost
this license years ago.
where did you find it?

441
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:04,395
- in the couch!
- where did you get the couch?

442
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,564
- what does it matter?
- h.d. buttercup?

443
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,066
Yeah, maybe.

444
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,769
- how did you know?
- i used to sell
furniture there.

445
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:15,506
- maybe it fell in.
- bullshit!  how long have
you been stalking vince?

446
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,675
<i>sadie:
uh, johnny, vince is
on the phone.</i>

447
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:21,045
He says to tell you it was all
a sorority prank on turtle.

448
00:21:21,063 --> 00:21:23,631
Here's my current
license.

449
00:21:23,665 --> 00:21:25,967
It's not lost, see?

450
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,870
Oh.

451
00:21:31,222 --> 00:21:33,274
- ( laughing )
- who would have thought

452
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:35,876
That a girl would want
to get in my underwear
before vince's?

453
00:21:35,911 --> 00:21:39,180
Who would have thought anyone
would have wanted to get
anywhere near your underwear?

454
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,948
Don't be bitter because
i have more fans than you.

455
00:21:40,983 --> 00:21:43,084
<i>- eric: you gonna
tell jamie?
- no.</i>

456
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:45,252
Drama stopped the real
stalker in my story.

457
00:21:45,287 --> 00:21:48,072
- good move.
- if he was the real one,
i would have stopped him.

458
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,641
- trust me.
- vince: all right, guys, what
do you want to do tonight?

459
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:53,044
- celebrate our freedom.
- e, you got ashley?

460
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,879
I called her,
i haven't heard back yet.

461
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:57,848
- i gotta work.
- i don't think that face would
do great in clubs anyway.

462
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,134
I think that makeup's
bringing on some adult acne.

463
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:03,137
- right?
- oh ho ho!

464
00:22:03,171 --> 00:22:06,774
- i'm gonna kill you, drama.
- you and what sorority sister?

465
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:09,677
So, listen, vinnie,
i'm glad it all worked out.

466
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:11,579
So are you gonna join us
out tonight?

467
00:22:11,613 --> 00:22:14,382
Naw, no can do.
got a mess i'm dealing with
here at the office.

468
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,984
- everything okay?
- it will be.

469
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:19,420
<i>- okay, talk later.
- all right, later.</i>

470
00:22:19,454 --> 00:22:21,389
Hi, mr. gold.

471
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,890
I'm craig.

472
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,026
H.r. sent me down
to fill in for lloyd.

473
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,194
Great.

00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:29,497
I really look forward
to helping you out.

475
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:31,599
Uh, do you know when
he'll be back?

You want the truth?

477
00:22:33,969 --> 00:22:35,536

- uh, he won't.

478
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,605

00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:39,907
I shot him and i buried him
underneath my desk.

480
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,843
<i>- any more questions?
