1
00:00:03,273 --> 00:00:05,173
We have a meeting with
an Emmy-winning writer.

2
00:00:05,207 --> 00:00:07,359
- I don't do dramas.
- And I don't do comedy.

3
00:00:07,394 --> 00:00:10,654
Read it. If you like it,
I'll write some more.

4
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:13,027
You are running
out of cash, and fast.

5
00:00:13,062 --> 00:00:15,472
I sank every dollar
I had into this, Marvin.

6
00:00:15,506 --> 00:00:17,042
I want to ask you a question.

7
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:19,647
I'm going to be looking for someone
else to run the tv department.

8
00:00:19,682 --> 00:00:22,953
- I don't think you need to.
- No.

9
00:00:22,987 --> 00:00:25,054
- Hey, is that E?
- Tell him how we might have
found your next script.

10
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:27,458
- What's he sayin'?
- He's got a potential movie for me.

11
00:00:27,492 --> 00:00:30,597
- Ari, I'm not satisfied.
- I'm not the man who's gonna satisfy you.

12
00:00:30,632 --> 00:00:32,334
- She quit.
- John Stamos?

13
00:00:32,368 --> 00:00:36,173
The network loves him.
They said if he's in, they're in.

14
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:38,310
- John Stamos may be my co-star.
- Ooh!

15
00:00:38,345 --> 00:00:40,113
I got a way we could
both make some money.

16
00:00:40,147 --> 00:00:41,282
Come down to Mexico with me.

17
00:00:41,317 --> 00:00:43,752
I double-dare you to arm
wrestle me for Vince.

18
00:00:43,787 --> 00:00:46,556
You wanna hit me as hard as you can?
If I do that, then what?

19
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,090
Uh-hh!

20
00:00:48,124 --> 00:00:49,926
Oh no!

<i>- E: Yo yo!
- Yo!</i>

37
00:02:13,897 --> 00:02:16,232
Hey, E.
What brings you here?

38
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:18,802
Sloan release you
from the marital stockade?

39
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:21,638
I just came by to make sure drama was
all set for his meeting with Stamos.

40
00:02:21,672 --> 00:02:23,840
- You brought my lucky shirt.
- You get his laundry now?

41
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:26,310
<i>- Wow, you really are his manager.
- I didn't get his laundry.</i>

42
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:28,446
I stopped by his house because
I was there and he forgot it.

43
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,383
Your selflessness will pay off,
because this lucky shirt
will officially seal the deal.

44
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:35,285
You're not really nervous about
this meeting, are you, Johnny?

45
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,687
Yeah, bro, of course I am.

46
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:38,722
That's why I thought I'd host him here.

47
00:02:38,757 --> 00:02:41,525
And maybe you could meet him
and he could see the place

48
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,227
<i>and really get a feel
for what I'm all about.</i>

49
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:45,629
You can show him you can play the
ugly brother in real life too.

50
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:47,665
- ( E laughs )
- Is that cool, bro?

51
00:02:47,699 --> 00:02:49,933
- Of course it is.
- Thanks, bro.

52
00:02:49,968 --> 00:02:52,569
- I'm so sorry I'm gonna miss this.
- Mmm, yeah, but unfortunately

53
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:54,805
you'll be in Mexico, not getting laid.

54
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:56,640
<i>- Another hater.
- Not at all.</i>

55
00:02:56,674 --> 00:02:58,809
I wish you the best.
I gotta go to the staff meeting.

56
00:02:58,843 --> 00:03:00,510
- Knock 'em dead, Drama.
- All right, bro.

57
00:03:00,545 --> 00:03:03,246
Hey, E, you gonna find time to
read that "Air-walker" script?

58
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,048
- I'll read it after the staff meeting.
- I already read it.

59
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,784
It's pretty good.
A little darker than "Aquaman,"

60
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,720
but still very cool. Lavin agrees.

61
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,693
- What?
- You never read anything
I give you that fast.

62
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:19,463
Aw, someone's jealous of Scotty Lavin.

63
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:21,399
I'm not jealous of him.
I just don't like the guy.

64
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:23,768
Maybe it's the dueling
napoleonic complexes?

65
00:03:23,802 --> 00:03:26,837
- E may be a little taller.
- Yeah, but Scotty's a little
better-looking.

66
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:29,039
- You think?
- It's like you and Stamos... it's a fact.

67
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:31,208
<i>- It's not an opinion.
- E: No, the fact is</i>

68
00:03:31,242 --> 00:03:34,211
that two dudes with no pussy
are talking about two other
dudes' looks and it's weird.

69
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:36,746
It is a little weird.
Still, read it!

70
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:38,615
<i>I don't care if you don't like him.</i>

71
00:03:38,649 --> 00:03:41,084
It could be big.

72
00:03:42,286 --> 00:03:43,886
Casey Wasserman,
Jeff Katzenberg,

73
00:03:43,921 --> 00:03:45,855
Mike Meldman and John Ellis
have all confirmed

74
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:47,990
for your N.F.L. pitch,
which brings the count to 20.

75
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:49,759
Billionaire boys club day,
I love it.

76
00:03:49,793 --> 00:03:52,161
You make sure that you get all their
favorite food and drinks ready.

77
00:03:52,195 --> 00:03:54,063
I got lobster salad
from Sable's for Ellis,

78
00:03:54,097 --> 00:03:55,998
a pastrami
from Nate 'n Al's for Casey

79
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,633
and Tana's veal parm
for Meldman.

80
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,601
But I couldn't find out
what Katzenberg likes to eat.

81
00:03:59,636 --> 00:04:01,403
He lives off diet coke.
You see how lean he is?

82
00:04:01,437 --> 00:04:04,106
I need a "Kung fu panda" bear
somewhere where he can see it.

83
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,074
Okay, I've got the diet coke.

84
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:08,443
I need more of it...
In those glass retro bottles.

85
00:04:08,477 --> 00:04:12,046
I need at least a $20-million commitment
from each one of those guys.

86
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,248
Everything high-class
and highly enticing.

87
00:04:15,282 --> 00:04:18,017
Ari, you don't have to be nervous.
You're gonna do great.

88
00:04:18,052 --> 00:04:19,986
- What are you, my life coach?
- No, I just...

89
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,055
Listen, don't try to get intimate with me,
Jake. It makes me uncomfortable.

90
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:25,891
<i>- Okay.
- What is she still doing here?</i>

91
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:28,593
- Did she unquit?
- I believe she's just packing up.

92
00:04:28,627 --> 00:04:30,828
- Should I call security?
- No no, I'll speak to her.

93
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:33,230
- Is that wise?
- Send them off with sweetness, Jake.

94
00:04:33,264 --> 00:04:36,433
Hopefully you won't have to
taste my sugar anytime soon.

95
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:39,369
- Yeah, let's hope.
- Lizzie, can I talk to you for a second?

96
00:04:39,403 --> 00:04:43,539
- About what, Ari?
- I was hoping that we could part
on good terms.

97
00:04:43,573 --> 00:04:45,741
( Snickers ) You can
go fuck yourself, Ari.

98
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:49,144
Now is that nice? I'm preparing a
nice severance package for you.

99
00:04:49,178 --> 00:04:51,779
- Wow.
- You don't want me angry
when I'm writing you a check?

100
00:04:51,814 --> 00:04:53,614
No, I don't.
What I want you to do

101
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:56,316
is shove that severance
package up your fucking ass.

102
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,617
<i>- If you were my daughter...
- If I was your daughter</i>

103
00:04:58,651 --> 00:05:00,818
I would blow my fucking brains out.

104
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:03,687
Look, Ari, you might think I'm
some sort of cute little pushover,

105
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:07,157
but you screwed me and I am going to
do everything I can to pay you back.

106
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:08,991
Is it that time of the month
for you, Lizzie?

107
00:05:09,026 --> 00:05:11,827
Because I think that your
hormones are making your brain

108
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:14,195
forget who you are threatening.

109
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:17,497
You don't scare me, Ari,
not even a little bit.

110
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:21,834
- Did you hear that?
- I heard the polite version this morning.

111
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:24,603
- I hope you said what I said.
- I said it politely.

112
00:05:29,074 --> 00:05:31,075
- Morning.
- Sloan sent over

113
00:05:31,109 --> 00:05:33,477
some pictures of flower
centerpieces for you to go over.

114
00:05:33,512 --> 00:05:35,279
<i>I promised I'd run it by you.</i>

115
00:05:35,313 --> 00:05:38,315
Sorry, I can't do it.
I've got to finish reading this script.

116
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:40,083
- Anything good?
- Yeah, real good.

117
00:05:40,117 --> 00:05:42,985
- So why do you sound so upset?
- Because Lavin found it.

118
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,854
Yeech. Did you disinfect it?

119
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:47,756
Yeah. It's for Vince.
There could be a huge franchise in this.

120
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:50,759
- I just don't know what to do.
- If it's good, what's there to do?

121
00:05:50,793 --> 00:05:54,528
- He's got his own clients.
- Tell him he did good
and you'll take it from here.

122
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:57,697
- Kill him with kindness.
- Keep your enemies close.

123
00:05:57,731 --> 00:05:59,832
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah, I've got a couple.

124
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:01,567
Do me a favor...
Look through these pictures

125
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:02,968
Sloan sent and pick
the ones you like?

126
00:06:03,002 --> 00:06:05,170
Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.

127
00:06:05,204 --> 00:06:07,905
Ha, probably not. Leave it on my desk.

128
00:06:10,442 --> 00:06:12,910
- Yo, Scott.
- Jesus fucking Christ, Eric.

129
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:14,811
Don't be afraid to knock, okay?

130
00:06:14,845 --> 00:06:17,213
Sometimes I like to start
my day off with a nice whack.

131
00:06:17,247 --> 00:06:20,415
- You have a glass office.
- Yeah, I mentally block that out.

132
00:06:22,118 --> 00:06:25,019
- The script's good.
- Excuse me, it's good?

133
00:06:25,053 --> 00:06:27,921
Get the fuck outta here!
It's great and you know it.

134
00:06:27,956 --> 00:06:30,457
<i>- Come on!
- The script's great. Good work, Scott.</i>

135
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:32,825
<i>- I'll set a meeting.
- I've already done that.</i>

136
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,794
It's for this Thursday.
We're good.

137
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,896
You already set a meeting?
I hadn't read the script yet.

138
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,297
I knew you were gonna love it.
It's all on the page, babe.

139
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,332
Ari's gotta weigh in too.
You realize that, right?

140
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:45,403
I already sent it to Ari and he's
burned a day by not responding.

141
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:48,705
So why don't you let Ari conquer
AT&T or whatever he's trying to do,

142
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,440
and let's you and I run Vince?

143
00:06:50,475 --> 00:06:53,843
We've been over this, Scott.
You and I don't run Vince.

144
00:06:53,878 --> 00:06:56,112
<i>- I run Vince.
- You are unbelievable.</i>

145
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:58,714
Are you really worried that
I'm gonna steal your client?

146
00:06:58,749 --> 00:07:01,216
He's not just my client, he's my best
friend since I'm five years old.

147
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:03,285
Oh, so you're worried I'm
gonna steal your best friend?

148
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,786
I'm worried you're gonna
steal my best friend.

149
00:07:04,821 --> 00:07:06,454
<i>You can't compete
with me there, Eric!</i>

150
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:08,423
I'm way more fun than you are.
I'm single.

151
00:07:08,457 --> 00:07:11,092
<i>You are old and an almost-married man.</i>

152
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:13,627
- Let youth be served!
- Will you listen to yourself?

153
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:16,162
You're such an idiot.
I'm trying to be polite, Scott,

154
00:07:16,196 --> 00:07:18,696
but it's getting harder and harder.
Stay out of my way.

155
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:21,365
- Or what?
- Or I'll knock your teeth
down your throat.

156
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,868
Come here, come here! I want to bounce
you on my knee, babe. Come here!

157
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:28,105
<i>P.A.: we'd like to remind you to
turn off all electronic devices...</i>

158
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,307
So shouldn't you be briefing me
on this business or something?

159
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:34,276
I'm not a good salesman.
I wouldn't do it justice.

160
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,611
You got me on the plane to
Mexico and I have no clue why.

161
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:39,680
- I'd say you're pretty good.
- Well, you're obsessed with me,

162
00:07:39,715 --> 00:07:42,149
so I knew that part wouldn't be hard.

163
00:07:42,183 --> 00:07:44,251
I'm not obsessed with you.

164
00:07:44,285 --> 00:07:46,486
You try to make out with me
every chance you get.

165
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,954
I already apologized
for misreading that situation.

166
00:07:48,989 --> 00:07:52,190
- I'm just kidding.
- So we're ready to joke about it?

167
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:54,425
- I think so.
- That's progress.

168
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:57,127
So what, you gonna try
and make out with me again?

169
00:07:57,162 --> 00:07:59,362
No, I came here for business.

170
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:02,798
Good. Because my friend's a
genius and you're gonna love him.

171
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:05,167
And what does this genius
want with me?

172
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:07,902
- Don't be so insecure.
- I'm serious!

173
00:08:07,936 --> 00:08:09,870
My business doesn't exactly lend itself

174
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:12,006
to helping some genius
boyfriend of yours.

175
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,341
Or are you guys just planning
on holding me for ransom?

176
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,242
Naw, you're not worth enough.

177
00:08:17,611 --> 00:08:19,912
- And he's not my boyfriend.
- Well, who is he?

178
00:08:19,947 --> 00:08:23,916
You're here for business,
so don't worry about it.

179
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,818
Can I at least know this genius's name?

180
00:08:26,853 --> 00:08:28,519
Carlos Avion.

181
00:08:28,554 --> 00:08:31,355
- Sounds fake.
- You are jealous.

182
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,824
Uh, no... I'm just here for business.

183
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:36,560
And why are you suddenly trying
to lure me into hitting on you?

184
00:08:36,594 --> 00:08:38,995
Oh, I'm sorry I am not!

185
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,897
Okay, good.

186
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:43,666
- Good.
- Then wake me when we land.

187
00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:47,736
Vince!
Vince, Vince.

188
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,971
- He's here.
- Johnny, I'm here.

189
00:08:50,006 --> 00:08:51,840
<i>Relax, I'm coming.</i>

190
00:08:51,874 --> 00:08:54,209
- Hey, John, how are you?
- Good. Vince!

191
00:08:54,244 --> 00:08:56,246
- How are you, man?
- How are you doing?

192
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,014
Nice to see you.
This is Squanto.

193
00:08:58,048 --> 00:08:59,482
Welcome.
Can I get you a drink?

194
00:08:59,516 --> 00:09:01,884
This place is beautiful, Vince.
Beautiful.

195
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:04,153
You live here too, Jimmy?

196
00:09:04,187 --> 00:09:06,688
Uh, no, Vince just really
enjoys my company.

197
00:09:06,723 --> 00:09:08,323
So I come over here pretty often

198
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:11,092
'cause Vince gets really sad
and lonely when I'm not around.

199
00:09:11,126 --> 00:09:13,961
- Right, bro?
- Yeah, Johnny's really great
to have around.

200
00:09:13,996 --> 00:09:16,163
Oh, that's cool. I hate my brother.

201
00:09:16,198 --> 00:09:18,465
Uh... how was Broadway?

202
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:20,600
Oh, it was good.
Excellent experience.

203
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:22,502
Fourth Broadway show.

204
00:09:22,536 --> 00:09:24,637
You know, I understudied
for chino in "West side story"

205
00:09:24,671 --> 00:09:26,405
- when I was 14.
- Really?

206
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:29,607
Yeah, I had my first sexual experience
with the chick playing Anita.

207
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:32,544
Great tits...
Big giant nipples.

208
00:09:32,578 --> 00:09:35,880
What year was that?
My favorite cousin Angela played that role.

209
00:09:37,349 --> 00:09:39,283
It was off-off-Broadway.

210
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:41,885
- Newark.
- Aw, I'm just busting your balls.

211
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,054
No way Angela would have fucked you.
You, she'd fuck.

212
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:46,622
- Are you single?
- Currently.

213
00:09:46,657 --> 00:09:48,491
Maybe I'll fix you up with her.
This chick is so hot.

214
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:51,627
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah. People say we look
like identical twins.

215
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:53,462
Let's go outside.

216
00:09:53,496 --> 00:09:55,563
Yeah.

217
00:09:56,932 --> 00:09:59,200
So have you had a chance to
look at the script, John?

218
00:09:59,234 --> 00:10:01,235
Oh no, not yet, but my Agent loves it.

219
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:04,471
See, for me it's not about the script.
It's about us.

220
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:06,973
Can we spend the next five
or 10 years together?

221
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,574
You know, the chemistry.

222
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,743
Oh, you have a ping-pong table?
Do you play?

223
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,211
A little. You?

224
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,512
I love ping-pong, man.
It's my new obsession.

225
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:16,913
I bet you get a lot of chicks
playing ping-pong, huh?

226
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:19,082
Ping-pong is the new billiards, Vince.

227
00:10:19,116 --> 00:10:21,718
The sport's blown up. Come on,
let's play. I'll go easy on you.

228
00:10:22,987 --> 00:10:24,220
( Clears throat )

229
00:10:24,254 --> 00:10:27,623
You know what?
Why don't you play with Johnny?

230
00:10:27,657 --> 00:10:30,091
You're really better matched.
He's really good.

231
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:32,226
- Oh, come on.
- What?

232
00:10:32,261 --> 00:10:34,161
Well, you don't have the build.

233
00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:38,565
<i>- Maybe I'll surprise you.
- All right, bigshot.</i>

234
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:40,566
Let's rally for serve.

235
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:43,669
Ping... pong...

236
00:10:43,703 --> 00:10:45,704
Rally's... on!

237
00:10:45,738 --> 00:10:48,139
<i>- Drama: Oh!
- Whoa!</i>

238
00:10:48,174 --> 00:10:50,775
It's going to be a long day
for Uncle Jesse!

239
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,310
Let's go.

240
00:10:53,344 --> 00:10:56,346
<i>- ( Rock music playing )
- Come on.</i>

241
00:11:00,283 --> 00:11:02,250
They're ready.

242
00:11:14,528 --> 00:11:16,695
- Hello, everyone.
- All: Ari.

243
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,565
<i>- John, how was the lobster salad?
- Nice touch, Ari.</i>

244
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:22,534
- Though I am partial to Sable's crab salad.
- I'll kill my assistant.

245
00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:23,969
He said he talked to your wife.

246
00:11:24,004 --> 00:11:25,437
She probable said that.
She barely knows me.

247
00:11:25,472 --> 00:11:27,438
Instead of your assistant, kill her.

248
00:11:27,473 --> 00:11:29,706
- My veal parm was excellent.
- Love to hear it, Mike.

249
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,407
- How are you, Matthew?
- Good to see you.

250
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,309
- Nice to see you, Mr. Wasserman.
- Ari.

251
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:35,411
Shawne Merriman, a surprise.
Good to see you, sir.

252
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,512
Hey, I'm a free agent this year.
I thought I'd sit in.

253
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:39,713
- The more the Merriman.
( Mimics rim-shot )
- ( Groans )

254
00:11:39,747 --> 00:11:42,750
Rim-shot!
Listen, Katzenberg... where is he?

255
00:11:42,784 --> 00:11:44,952
<i>I am holding a large plastic dragon.</i>

256
00:11:44,986 --> 00:11:47,487
This will represent Mr. Katzenberg.
How about that?

257
00:11:47,522 --> 00:11:50,156
<i>He will sit right here.
Down to business.</i>

258
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:53,393
I want, and everyone
in this town wants,

259
00:11:53,427 --> 00:11:58,264
an N.F.L. team playing in a
brand-new state-of-the-art facility

260
00:11:58,298 --> 00:12:00,232
within five years, all right?

261
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:02,334
<i>I think with the power
and the money at this table,</i>

262
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:04,369
<i>we can get it done in three.</i>

263
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:07,772
Now is the time for L.A.
to have an N.F.L. team,

264
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,408
and I am the right guy to lead
the charge to make this happen.

265
00:12:10,443 --> 00:12:12,343
<i>Man: What do you know
about football, Ari?</i>

266
00:12:12,377 --> 00:12:14,411
Don't tell me you played in High School.

267
00:12:14,446 --> 00:12:16,881
I did play a little in High School.
I was pretty good for a jew.

268
00:12:16,915 --> 00:12:18,916
What, were you a field-goal kicker?

269
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,651
<i>- ( Chuckling )
- I was an offensive lineman</i>

270
00:12:21,686 --> 00:12:24,187
and I illegally tripped
Mr. Shawne Merriman one time.

271
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:26,289
Ari, you couldn't trip me up
with a shotgun.

272
00:12:26,323 --> 00:12:28,223
But still... how are you gonna run a team?

273
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:30,225
We put up the money
and you're in charge?

274
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:33,094
Like I do here at the world's
largest talent agency,

275
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:37,097
I bring in the best.
I attract the best, I've always done that.

276
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,999
Bill Belichick is a friend.

277
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:42,235
<i>When his contract is up
in New England, who knows?</i>

278
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:44,136
I mean, hell, everyone wants to live here.

279
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:47,438
It is paradise. The only thing
this town doesn't have, gentlemen,

280
00:12:47,473 --> 00:12:48,706
is an N.F.L. team.

281
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,875
All I need is the money
and I can make that happen.

282
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:54,644
Barbara Miller has committed $10 million

283
00:12:54,678 --> 00:12:57,279
and agreed to work for free
as the mascot.

284
00:12:57,313 --> 00:13:00,548
- ( Chuckling ) - How about that... the
L.A. Cougars?

285
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,316
- ( Laughter )
- Everybody wins.

286
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,319
Gentlemen, look at the packets
right in front of you.

287
00:13:06,354 --> 00:13:09,355
There's a great deal of information.
Sign checks... big ones.

288
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:12,791
And if not, regret not being a part
of this for the rest of your lives.

289
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,927
Why do you let this guy get to you?

290
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:19,196
I don't know. My assistant tells me I
should try to kill him with kindness,

291
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,765
and I tried, but it's like this
guy's immune to human interaction.

292
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,200
<i>I don't think you should be fake.</i>

293
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:25,769
I think you should just
honestly tell him how you feel.

294
00:13:25,803 --> 00:13:28,437
<i>- I did!
- So let it go.</i>

295
00:13:28,471 --> 00:13:30,872
He found a great project for Vince.

296
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:33,041
Oh, what a dick!

297
00:13:33,075 --> 00:13:34,675
I should be happy, right?

298
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,576
<i>Vince won't forget
what you do for him</i>

299
00:13:36,611 --> 00:13:38,845
<i>no matter who gives him
a script, you know that.</i>

300
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,847
<i>I do know that.
But I don't need this guy</i>

301
00:13:40,881 --> 00:13:43,215
getting Vince jumping out
of any more planes, okay?

302
00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:45,383
You can't control who Vince
is friends with, babe.

303
00:13:45,418 --> 00:13:49,620
<i>- Yeah.
- Just make sure business
is going good.</i>

304
00:13:49,655 --> 00:13:50,955
Yeah.

305
00:13:50,989 --> 00:13:54,358
- You're ignoring me.
- No, I'm not.

306
00:13:54,392 --> 00:13:56,693
You want me to tell Murray
to keep Scott away from Vince?

307
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:58,628
No! Are you kidding?
That's my business.

308
00:13:58,662 --> 00:14:00,629
- I think I can handle that, Sloan.
- Okay.

309
00:14:00,664 --> 00:14:03,265
I would like to stick Scott next
to Murray at the wedding though.

310
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:04,733
( Laughs ) Done.

311
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:07,668
- Did you look at the flowers?
- Uh...

312
00:14:07,703 --> 00:14:11,038
Yeah yeah, I like the...

313
00:14:11,072 --> 00:14:12,806
Red ones.
I like the red ones.

314
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,008
The red, huh?

315
00:14:15,043 --> 00:14:18,144
Look at them, please.
We're meeting with the florist tomorrow.

316
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:19,779
I will, okay. I'm sorry.

317
00:14:19,813 --> 00:14:21,480
- I love you.
- Thank you.

318
00:14:21,515 --> 00:14:23,515
<i>- Love you.
- Bye.</i>

319
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:24,816
Bye.

320
00:14:26,118 --> 00:14:27,786
Jennie? Will you let me know

321
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,655
<i>when Lavin's back
from lunch, please.</i>

<i>( P.A. Announcements

323
00:14:35,294 --> 00:14:37,561
Turtle: The Yankee hat
comes with me everywhere.

324
00:14:37,596 --> 00:14:40,330
Maybe I'll get you a sombrero
with a Yankee symbol on it.

325
00:14:40,365 --> 00:14:42,332
Whoo!
( Laughs )

326
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:44,067
Oh, there they are.

327
00:14:48,372 --> 00:14:49,806
<i>Hola mamacita.</i>

328
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,308
Hey, don't get fresh, Edgar.
I'll tell your boss.

329
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,411
<i>- The boss is here.
- Hola.</i>

330
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:59,681
<i>- Corazón. ¿como estás?
- Bien bien.</i>

331
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:02,183
And you must be Turtle.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

332
00:15:02,217 --> 00:15:04,318
I understand you can
offer us big things.

333
00:15:04,352 --> 00:15:07,353
<i>- Turtle: In what way?
- He's funny.</i>

334
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:08,888
He's nervous.

335
00:15:08,922 --> 00:15:11,623
Don't worry... I won't kill
you until you turn me down.

336
00:15:11,658 --> 00:15:13,525
<i>Get in, amigo.</i>

337
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,594
- Why has he got a gun?
- It's Mexico.

338
00:15:15,628 --> 00:15:18,295
- Everyone's got a gun here.
- If I wanted to be involved
in shit like this

339
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,630
I would have went back east
to work for my Uncle Carmine.

340
00:15:20,664 --> 00:15:23,198
It's nothing illegal, I promise.

341
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,502
- What's the hold-up?
- The hold-up is where I come from,

342
00:15:27,537 --> 00:15:30,640
you don't get into a car with a
bunch of guys who are carrying.

343
00:15:36,346 --> 00:15:38,215
Here, now you are carrying too.

344
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:41,383
- I just want to know what this is about.
- Do you like Tequila?

345
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:43,751
- Yeah.
- That's what it's about.

346
00:15:43,786 --> 00:15:46,554
Tequila... the finest in the world.

347
00:15:48,023 --> 00:15:50,690
Turtle, I swear this is legitimate.

348
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:52,759
- Uh...
- Just trust me.

349
00:15:52,793 --> 00:15:54,994
Put it away.

350
00:15:59,932 --> 00:16:01,766
( Grunts )

351
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,934
D'oh!

352
00:16:02,968 --> 00:16:05,402
<i>- Whew! 10-2.
- I can count.</i>

353
00:16:05,437 --> 00:16:07,704
It ain't over yet.

354
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:17,112
Oh! It is now, son.

355
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:20,414
Good game, John.

356
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:22,883
I gotta split. I got another meeting.

357
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:25,218
Do you want to talk about the show?

358
00:16:25,253 --> 00:16:27,487
I'll talk to Phil.

359
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:36,995
Why would you embarrass a guy
who you want something from?

360
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,663
<i>Drama: I didn't mean
to embarrass him!</i>

361
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,764
He's got a Korean girl that
trains him three times a week.

362
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:43,999
<i>- He's got a ping-pong trainer?
- Yes, John, and you beat him.</i>

363
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:46,001
When I play, I play to win.

364
00:16:46,035 --> 00:16:47,837
John's a notoriously
bad loser to start with.

365
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,237
- I didn't know that either!
- I beat him at golf once,

366
00:16:50,272 --> 00:16:51,571
he didn't talk to me for two years.

367
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:53,273
Maybe this is something
you could have told me

368
00:16:53,307 --> 00:16:54,707
<i>before the meeting, Phil.</i>

369
00:16:54,742 --> 00:16:57,209
I didn't know you were gonna
embarrass him, John!

370
00:16:57,244 --> 00:16:59,912
<i>- Maybe there's someone else
we could get.
- No, John, there's not.</i>

371
00:16:59,946 --> 00:17:03,915
You know why? Because there's nobody
better- looking than you in this town.

372
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,285
- Rob Lowe maybe.
- The network is into this guy.

373
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,787
They like Stamos...
No, they love Stamos.

374
00:17:09,822 --> 00:17:12,123
He was excited. So call his Agent,

375
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:15,626
<i>call his house, call whoever you
need to and figure out a way</i>

376
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,028
to smooth this out... Or don't.

377
00:17:25,168 --> 00:17:27,102
Lavin's back.

378
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:39,580
Oh, look at that!
He knocks like a gentleman.

379
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:43,016
( Forced chuckle ) Listen, Scott, the
only thing that's important to me

380
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:46,318
is Vince's career.
"Air-walker" is amazing.

381
00:17:46,352 --> 00:17:48,420
Thank you.

382
00:17:49,622 --> 00:17:51,923
- Was that an apology?
- Was that not clear?

383
00:17:51,957 --> 00:17:54,191
Not really.
I mean, it wasn't crystal clear.

384
00:17:54,226 --> 00:17:56,360
- You didn't say sorry or anything.
- Ahem!

385
00:17:56,394 --> 00:17:58,128
Hey, oh hey!

386
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:00,163
Listen, I appreciate it, okay?

387
00:18:00,197 --> 00:18:03,599
I appreciate it and I am a big
enough man to say I'm sorry as well.

388
00:18:03,633 --> 00:18:05,301
- For what?
- For being a dick.

389
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:08,237
- Today or every day?
- Since you started here I have been a dick.

390
00:18:08,271 --> 00:18:10,472
- Yeah.
- I was bitter about the way you came in

391
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,207
with Vince as your star client,

392
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:14,809
you know, and your girlfriend's
connection to the boss,

393
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,512
but I see that you are a good dude
and you are good at what you do.

394
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:18,846
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

395
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,482
Hopefully you have noticed
the same about me.

396
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:24,384
- I have.
- Listen,

397
00:18:24,418 --> 00:18:26,653
we are the future of this company.
Look, this guy,

398
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,154
he doesn't even show up anymore.

399
00:18:28,188 --> 00:18:30,189
- He's too busy servicing models.
- Exactly.

400
00:18:30,223 --> 00:18:33,191
So it could just be us
and we should stick together.

401
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,926
Pffft!

402
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:38,361
I'm kidding. I'm... come on.

403
00:18:38,396 --> 00:18:40,096
No hug.

404
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,875
( Woman sings in Spanish )

405
00:18:56,878 --> 00:18:59,080

406
00:19:00,615 --> 00:19:02,817
<i>¡Atención, atención!</i>

407
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:06,388
Please, everyone,
enjoy this special day.

408
00:19:06,422 --> 00:19:08,090
Y tomen mucho...

409
00:19:08,124 --> 00:19:10,558
<i>- ( Cheers )
- ...Y más.</i>

410
00:19:10,592 --> 00:19:12,660
<i>To the future!</i>

411
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:16,896
- To the future.
- To the future.

412
00:19:18,132 --> 00:19:19,700
- Mm.
- Mm.

413
00:19:19,734 --> 00:19:20,901
- Whoa.
- So?

414
00:19:20,935 --> 00:19:23,303
- You like it?
- It's incredible.

415
00:19:23,337 --> 00:19:25,972
- I am a little fucked up though.
- You're such a lightweight.

416
00:19:26,006 --> 00:19:29,174
I had eight shots. Are you trying to get
me drunk so you can take advantage of me?

417
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:32,444
'Cause I don't have to be
drunk for you to do that.

418
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,746
Turtle.

419
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,849
Would you just kiss me already
and stop the bullshit?

420
00:19:40,552 --> 00:19:42,819
- What, is it that Carlos guy?
- Are you kidding?

421
00:19:42,853 --> 00:19:44,886
I told you, he's an old family friend.

422
00:19:44,921 --> 00:19:47,054
- He is old.
- Stop it!

423
00:19:47,088 --> 00:19:48,555
- He is.
- Turtle.

424
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:51,357
- You like it?
- Your father created this?

425
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:55,260
Making the finest Tequila in all of
Mexico was my father's life's work.

426
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:57,429
Now it is mine.

427
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:01,231
Walk with me.
Alex, excuse us a moment, please.

428
00:20:07,137 --> 00:20:09,539
My father, may he rest in peace,
has gone,

429
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:11,974
and I want the world
to taste his creation.

430
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:13,809
Me too.
What's it called?

431
00:20:13,843 --> 00:20:15,643
He named it in honor of our family.

432
00:20:15,678 --> 00:20:18,913
<i>- Tequila Avión.
- Gracias.</i>

433
00:20:18,947 --> 00:20:20,047
<i>De nada.</i>

434
00:20:20,082 --> 00:20:22,049
Tomorrow, I will take you to the place

435
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,484
where my father first
began production in 1948,

436
00:20:24,518 --> 00:20:27,353
- where we still produce it today.
- I'd love to see that.

437
00:20:27,387 --> 00:20:29,421
But tonight we celebrate.

438
00:20:29,455 --> 00:20:32,323
Any girls you have your eyes on?

439
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:34,358
Making love on Avión is unmatched.

440
00:20:34,393 --> 00:20:38,063
To be honest, Carlos, I kinda
only have my eye on Alex.

441
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:42,101
- Alex is like a daughter to me.
- No, no, no.

442
00:20:42,136 --> 00:20:44,303
I didn't mean to bang.
I'm a nice guy, Carlos.

443
00:20:44,337 --> 00:20:46,538
That remains to be seen.

444
00:20:46,572 --> 00:20:48,072
- ( Sighs )
- I tell you what...

445
00:20:48,107 --> 00:20:51,944
You deliver for me, I will do
my best to deliver to you.

446
00:20:51,978 --> 00:20:54,045
What do I need to deliver?

447
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,480
I need a face for my family's Tequila.

448
00:20:56,515 --> 00:20:59,149
- You want mine?
- ( Laughs )

449
00:20:59,184 --> 00:21:01,618
- No.
- What then?

450
00:21:01,652 --> 00:21:04,020
Alex tells me that you
are very close friends

451
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,722
with Vincent Chase.

452
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:12,360
Aquaman and Avión...

453
00:21:12,395 --> 00:21:14,596
A match made in heaven.

454
00:21:16,298 --> 00:21:18,532
Jeffrey, I'm sorry
that you couldn't make it,

455
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:20,401
but I'm going to send gallons of diet coke

456
00:21:20,435 --> 00:21:22,302
over to you as soon as I get your check.

457
00:21:22,337 --> 00:21:24,638
Make it out to "cash."

458
00:21:26,407 --> 00:21:29,175
That... It's gonna be
a great year thanks to you.

459
00:21:29,209 --> 00:21:31,377
Thank you, my friend.
Yeah, baby!

460
00:21:31,411 --> 00:21:34,313
- More good news?
- Call my wife.
I may even take her to dinner.

461
00:21:34,347 --> 00:21:37,082
- All right.
- Yeah, and you
go to dinner as well. On me.

462
00:21:37,116 --> 00:21:38,816
- Really?
- Yeah, you got a girl?

463
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,452
- Not right now.
- You want cash for a hooker? Either way.

464
00:21:41,486 --> 00:21:43,153
- I'll just call your wife.
- All right.

465
00:21:43,187 --> 00:21:45,288
- ( Rings )
- Ari gold's office.

466
00:21:45,322 --> 00:21:47,256
Just a second.

467
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,825
Andrew Klein.

468
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:51,392
Jesus. Stay for this.

469
00:21:51,427 --> 00:21:54,195
This is the guy who missed the boat.
Learn how not to.

470
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,097
Andrew!

471
00:21:56,131 --> 00:21:57,798
<i>What a tragic time
for you to be calling.</i>

472
00:21:57,832 --> 00:22:00,500
<i>I just landed an NFL
team in Los Angeles.</i>

473
00:22:00,534 --> 00:22:02,835
And if you didn't blow your
entire career up your nose,

474
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:05,204
you'd be banging cheerleaders
up in a luxury box with us.

475
00:22:05,238 --> 00:22:07,539
I appreciate your support
in my recovery, Ari,

476
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:10,175
but I don't live with regrets.
I've been taught to be at peace

477
00:22:10,209 --> 00:22:13,645
<i>- with the choices I've made.
- So you're on the making- amends step?</i>

478
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,713
Yeah, I'm gonna have
to make amends for this.

479
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:17,715
<i>I bribed an orderly for his cell phone.</i>

480
00:22:17,749 --> 00:22:19,915
- Why, what's up?
- Hey.

481
00:22:19,949 --> 00:22:22,984
- God damn it.
- Right.

482
00:22:24,586 --> 00:22:27,921
Lizzie's making moves.
She's after our client...

483
00:22:27,956 --> 00:22:29,957
Well, your clients.

484
00:22:29,992 --> 00:22:31,692
Come on!
What does she have to offer?

485
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:34,660
She's got someone big behind her.
C.A.A. maybe.

486
00:22:34,695 --> 00:22:36,829
<i>- But she's making promises.
- How do you even know?</i>

487
00:22:36,863 --> 00:22:39,632
Half the town is in here with me
and they've got phone privileges.

488
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:42,201
Andrew Klein, you need to get
your ass off that telephone.

489
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,369
Klein, get off the phone.
Follow the rules.

490
00:22:44,403 --> 00:22:46,104
- Give me a second.
- Hang it up!

491
00:22:46,138 --> 00:22:48,073
( Sighs )
All right, bye for now, Ari.

492
00:22:48,107 --> 00:22:50,107
Hey, Klein, you know why
I fired you as an Agent?

493
00:22:50,142 --> 00:22:51,842
'Cause your punk-ass never listened.

494
00:22:51,876 --> 00:22:54,477
- Barbara!
- Is this about Lizzie?

495
00:22:54,512 --> 00:22:56,712
- How did you know?
- I heard.

496
00:22:56,747 --> 00:22:58,380
- Where's her list?
- Check your email.

497
00:22:58,414 --> 00:23:01,448
I'm already making calls
and I suggest you do the same.

498
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,023
Wow, was he this good this morning?

499
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,224
I guess he's been working
with his trainer.

500
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,026
Hey, John!

501
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,194
The stroke's looking better.

502
00:23:18,229 --> 00:23:20,529
What the fuck are you doing here?

503
00:23:20,564 --> 00:23:22,598
Your agent told me
where I could find you.

504
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,334
- Good to see you again, Vince.
- You too.

505
00:23:25,368 --> 00:23:26,935
- Impressive stuff.
- Yeah, thanks.

506
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,970
Soo Yeon is the best.
And this is Ellie.

507
00:23:29,004 --> 00:23:31,338
Anytime you want a lesson,
let me know.

508
00:23:31,372 --> 00:23:34,207
- Will do.
- John, I came to resolve our...

509
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:36,208
<i>- Little conflict.
- Conflict?</i>

510
00:23:36,243 --> 00:23:39,412
What, about the show?
We have no conflict.

511
00:23:39,446 --> 00:23:42,316
- We just have no chemistry.
- Come on, John.

512
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,818
We didn't even get to know
each other's chemistry

513
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:47,555
'cause you got mad that I beat you.

514
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:49,790
- ( Grunts )
- He beat you?

515
00:23:49,825 --> 00:23:51,458
Yeah, can you believe it?

516
00:23:51,492 --> 00:23:52,592
No.

517
00:23:53,928 --> 00:23:55,428
I didn't have my paddle.

518
00:23:55,462 --> 00:23:57,363
If we played here
and you had your paddle,

519
00:23:57,398 --> 00:23:59,799
I'm 100% sure you would
have kicked my ass.

520
00:24:03,403 --> 00:24:05,270
What, are you patronizing me here?

521
00:24:05,304 --> 00:24:06,571
What? No no.

522
00:24:06,606 --> 00:24:08,640
Then play me right now
and I will kick your ass.

523
00:24:08,674 --> 00:24:11,308
I'm a little worn out from earlier.

524
00:24:11,343 --> 00:24:13,143
( Laughing )

525
00:24:13,178 --> 00:24:15,779
Johnny,

526
00:24:15,813 --> 00:24:17,947
you're a bitch, you know that?

527
00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:21,283
A real pussy.

528
00:24:21,317 --> 00:24:24,486
You're all calm, cool,
collected on your home court

529
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,921
with your shitty-ass table in the grass

530
00:24:26,955 --> 00:24:29,657
and your fucked-up paddles and
come stains all over your table...

531
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:31,091
- Sorry, Vince.
- Eh.

532
00:24:31,126 --> 00:24:33,927
But here? You don't give a
man a chance at payback?

533
00:24:33,961 --> 00:24:36,695
You have come stains on your table?
That's gross.

534
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,898
Look, John, you got
your trainer here and all,

535
00:24:39,932 --> 00:24:42,533
but I've been playing this
game since I was a little kid,

536
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:44,735
so you shouldn't feel bad
that I beat you.

537
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:47,104
You beat me right now
and I'll do your tv show.

538
00:24:49,073 --> 00:24:50,373
- Really?
- Ye.

539
00:24:50,408 --> 00:24:52,609
Okay.

540
00:24:52,643 --> 00:24:55,812
But I'm gonna need
to change my clothes.

541
00:24:55,846 --> 00:24:57,646
Be right back.

542
00:24:57,681 --> 00:24:59,448
Work my backhand, Soo.

543
00:24:59,482 --> 00:25:01,483
He really beat you?

544
00:25:01,518 --> 00:25:03,652
Alex: Turtle, why do you want to leave?

545
00:25:03,686 --> 00:25:06,054
We're supposed to go see
the factory in the morning.

546
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,222
I've seen enough.
You can stay if you want.

547
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,324
( Groans ) What's your problem?

548
00:25:10,358 --> 00:25:13,726
- I don't have a problem.
- You're acting like an asshole
out of the blue,

549
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:17,096
so it's either 'cause I wouldn't kiss
you before or you're just a mean drunk.

550
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:20,466
- I'm not drunk anymore.
- Well, I'm still a little drunk,

551
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,268
so if you ever had a shot
at me, it would be now.

552
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:25,570
- You're a real tease, you know that Alex?
- What?

553
00:25:25,604 --> 00:25:27,404
<i>Yeah, maybe that's why
I hit on you the first time.</i>

554
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:30,707
You kept putting it out there, but
I didn't realize you had a motive.

555
00:25:30,741 --> 00:25:32,775
- What motive?
- To get Vince.

556
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,377
What the hell else am I doing here?

557
00:25:34,411 --> 00:25:36,078
- Turtle...
- You should have asked me in L.A.

558
00:25:36,113 --> 00:25:38,747
- I could have saved you the time.
- I knew you wouldn't have come.

559
00:25:38,781 --> 00:25:41,950
But I thought once you saw everything,
you'd see how real this is.

560
00:25:41,984 --> 00:25:45,520
- You should have invited Vince.
- I wanted to come with you.

561
00:25:45,555 --> 00:25:47,555
I don't know if I believe that.

562
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,224
You would if I fucked you though, right?

563
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:51,693
- It'd be a start.
- I'm not that easy.

564
00:25:51,727 --> 00:25:54,628
Are you interested in me or not?
Because I don't got time for games.

565
00:25:54,663 --> 00:25:57,030
I'm getting there, but this is real, Turtle.

566
00:25:57,065 --> 00:26:00,534
And no one's going to get used.
But if it all works out,
 then maybe we'll all get rich.

567
00:26:00,568 --> 00:26:03,002
- Vince is already rich.
- Maybe he'll get richer then.

568
00:26:03,037 --> 00:26:05,171
But I'm not, and I don't know about you...

569
00:26:05,205 --> 00:26:07,106
I got $1700 to my name.

570
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,341
So stay tonight. Sleep on it.

571
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:11,576
Then we'll go to the
factory in the morning.

572
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,144
It'll blow you away.

573
00:26:14,178 --> 00:26:17,047
Are we sleeping on it together?

574
00:26:17,081 --> 00:26:20,251
I don't want you to think
I did it for the wrong reasons.

575
00:26:20,285 --> 00:26:23,354
I don't care why you do it.

576
00:26:27,358 --> 00:26:30,058
- ( Shouts )
- ( Cheering ) Yes!

577
00:26:32,963 --> 00:26:34,930
Oh, would you look at this.

578
00:26:34,965 --> 00:26:36,064
Yeah, we... We made up.

579
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:38,433
<i>- We're paisanos now.
- Hey, way to be mature.</i>

580
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:40,968
<i>- What's going on here?
- Oh, it's not good.</i>

581
00:26:41,002 --> 00:26:44,370
<i>- He's kicking Johnny's ass.
- I thought Drama was better than him.</i>

582
00:26:44,404 --> 00:26:45,504
No he's not.

583
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:48,406
- Aha ha ha!
- ( Yells )

584
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:50,841
10-6, match point.

585
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,611
It looks like your boy
is going down in flames.

586
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:56,746
Play to his backhand.
It's very weak.

587
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,448
What the fuck did she just say?

588
00:26:58,482 --> 00:27:00,450
It's not that weak, Soo, thank you.

589
00:27:00,484 --> 00:27:02,853
- Let's go.
- Come on, Johnny!

590
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:07,858
Yeah, come on.

591
00:27:14,264 --> 00:27:15,231
No-ooo!

592
00:27:15,265 --> 00:27:16,899
No no, you motherfucking...

593
00:27:16,933 --> 00:27:19,501
Your brother's the John McEnroe
of ping-pong.

594
00:27:20,702 --> 00:27:23,036
( Laughs ) Still say it ain't the paddle?

595
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,970
- Great game, John.
- Thanks.

596
00:27:25,005 --> 00:27:27,773
I say you're much better
than I thought you were.

597
00:27:29,242 --> 00:27:32,277
- You hustled me, didn't you?
- Are you a sore loser, John?

598
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:35,713
- I don't like being played.
- Hey, I didn't hustle you!

599
00:27:35,748 --> 00:27:39,083
You beat me before and I beat
you right now, honest to God.

600
00:27:39,984 --> 00:27:41,685
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

601
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,954
So I guess that's it, huh?

602
00:27:44,988 --> 00:27:46,922
No, actually you have potential.

603
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,823
It's hard to find good competition.

604
00:27:48,857 --> 00:27:50,824
Maybe we could play on the set.

605
00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:53,260
- You'll do the show?
- Let me read the script first,

606
00:27:53,294 --> 00:27:54,761
- but...
- Yes, yes!

607
00:27:54,795 --> 00:27:57,229
- I'll definitely consider it.
- You're gonna love it.

608
00:27:57,264 --> 00:27:59,565
- And don't forget how much you love me.
- Right.

609
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:01,066
<i>( Hip-hop music playing )</i>

610
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,202
- He might do the show.
- All right!

611
00:28:04,236 --> 00:28:05,803
Vince: Hey, that's fantastic!

612
00:28:05,838 --> 00:28:09,373
You see, Johnny? Even though you
lost, he liked you for you.

613
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:11,474
Please, bro, I threw that game.

614
00:28:11,508 --> 00:28:14,644
He's just like me... you stroke
the ego, you get what you want.

615
00:28:14,678 --> 00:28:16,512
- Well played.
- Thanks, man.

616
00:28:16,546 --> 00:28:18,580
We're all going to Vegas for the night.
I got a plane.

617
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,882
<i>- Can I invite Stamos?
- Of course, Soo's coming.</i>

618
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:24,185
Hey, John, you want to go to Vegas?
Baby bro got a plane.

619
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,987
- Yeah, I'd love to.
- Scotty, you in?

620
00:28:26,021 --> 00:28:27,888
I never say no to a plane or Vegas.

621
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:29,957
- E?
- Uh, no, I can't.

622
00:28:29,991 --> 00:28:31,591
Come on, I'm not gonna bite.

623
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,260
We gotta take our newfound
friendship to the next level.

624
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,229
Yeah, I wanna hang out
with both my boys.

625
00:28:36,263 --> 00:28:38,631
I appreciate it, but I gotta see
the wedding planner tomorrow.

626
00:28:38,665 --> 00:28:40,332
- Oh God!
- Stamos: Getting married?

627
00:28:40,366 --> 00:28:42,334
- Yeah, in October.
- You poor bastard.

628
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,402
Ah well, let's go!

629
00:28:46,271 --> 00:28:50,541
- Later, E.
- I'll get blowed for you.
One time, all right.

630
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:53,409
We probably won't have any fun.
