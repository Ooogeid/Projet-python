1
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,847
- Mr. Gray, good morning.
- <i>Mr. Gray, Ari?</i>

2
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:25,025
You'll have to do a lot better than that
to get Vince on <i>Smokejumpers</i>.

3
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:27,547
Just want to show you the respect
that a studio head deserves.

4
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:28,987
That's very nice.

5
00:01:29,107 --> 00:01:31,278
Maybe if your client had done
the same on <i>Aquaman 2</i>

6
00:01:31,398 --> 00:01:33,242
you wouldn't be
in such a desperate position.

7
00:01:33,362 --> 00:01:35,041
Come on,
hasn't the kid suffered enough?

8
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,396
Roasting him on a spit
wouldn't be enough suffering

9
00:01:37,516 --> 00:01:39,705
- <i>as far as I'm concerned</i>.
- Really?

10
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:43,435
Alan, come on. We're talking
about the second lead here.

11
00:01:43,555 --> 00:01:46,359
<i>Vincent Chase is not gonna be
the second lead nor the third.</i>

12
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,602
Inact, he's not even gonna be
the toothless waitress

13
00:01:48,722 --> 00:01:50,739
whose one line is,
"We're all out of blueberries."

14
00:01:51,307 --> 00:01:52,651
<i>Goodbye, Ari.</i>

15
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:55,481
Who holds a grudge this long?

16
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:56,870
Women and gays.

17
00:01:58,156 --> 00:01:59,372
It's true.
Look it up.

18
00:01:59,604 --> 00:02:02,792
I don't understand.<i>Aquaman 2</i> did good.
You'd think he'd get over it by now.

19
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,442
- He hasn't, so we have to move on.
- Move on to what?

20
00:02:05,562 --> 00:02:07,255
Steve Parles loved meeting you.

21
00:02:07,814 --> 00:02:09,831
And he was serious about <i>Benji</i>.

22
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:12,312
- Come on.
- No, he's dead serious.

23
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,722
I don't normally sit home
on a Friday night and read--

24
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:16,969
Wife and the kids
are up in Santa Barbara, so I did.

25
00:02:17,089 --> 00:02:18,604
- And it's good?
- It's <i>Benji</i>.

26
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:21,686
- In the arctic?
- We're talking about Benji the dog?

27
00:02:21,846 --> 00:02:24,082
No, it's Benji Franklin
who goes to the arctic, you idiot.

28
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,983
- So did Steve make a real offer?
- Is $3 million real?

29
00:02:27,374 --> 00:02:30,064
- Ruff ruff.
- That's why I had to bring it to you.

30
00:02:30,294 --> 00:02:31,964
- How's the script, really?
- I cried.

31
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:33,880
I don't know
if I was because of the script

32
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:36,218
or the fact that I'm trying
to put you in a Benji movie,

33
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:40,080
but I sat at home alone
last night in my bed and I wept.

34
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,710
- I'd better read it then.
- You don't have to,

35
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,066
because it is exactly
what you think it is.

36
00:02:48,186 --> 00:02:50,617
And if you take it,
you're taking it for the same reason

37
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,819
that most people
in America take jobs--

38
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,385
because you need the money.

39
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,980
We've never made a decision
based on money alone.

40
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,458
I have cash to tide us over.

41
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,808
- Jesus.
- I do.

42
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,061
- I have a few shekels put away too.
- I can make my own money.

43
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:05,772
And I take care of you when you need it.
Nobody takes care of me.

44
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:07,498
Appreciate that, Vin.

45
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:09,206
- What the fuck?

46
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,692
Asshole!
What are you doing to our cars?

47
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:13,392
- They're being repossessed.
- What?

48
00:03:13,512 --> 00:03:14,874
Pay your bills, deadbeat.

49
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,419
What the fuck are you talking about,
you motherfucker?

50
00:03:23,018 --> 00:03:24,451
So what's the role?

51
00:03:24,683 --> 00:03:26,538
It's the young veterinarian
Mitch Kreeger.

52
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:28,373
Who gets top billing,
Vince or the dog?

53
00:03:28,493 --> 00:03:30,338
- That's a good question.
- It's legitimate.

54
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:32,298
All right,
let's discuss the downside.

55
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,967
Won't be banging your co-star.

56
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,032
It is a g-rated family film.

57
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:38,510
If it's somehow <i>Babe</i>, we're great.

58
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,386
And if it's <i>Garfield</i> and it blows up
like barry bonds's skull we're finished.

59
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:44,668
- I don't like this.
- How long do we have to decide?

60
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:46,686
Parles wants an answer by Monday.

61
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:49,574
Let's go to Villa,
look at some nice asses jiggle,

62
00:03:49,694 --> 00:03:51,283
and the answer will come to us.

63
00:03:51,561 --> 00:03:54,792
No no. Forget that.
There's only one place for real answers.

64
00:03:54,996 --> 00:03:56,156
Yeah?
Where's that?

65
00:03:56,388 --> 00:03:57,991
- Joshua Tree.
- Joshua Tree?

66
00:03:58,307 --> 00:04:00,467
No phones, no berries.

67
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,580
Just us men and our souls.

68
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,591
And a big bag of shrooms.

69
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,926
- That sounds idiotic.
- No no, I like it.

70
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,481
- Are you in, Ari?
- For shrooming in the desert?

71
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:12,714
No, for being there to help guide us
through this major decision.

72
00:04:14,476 --> 00:04:16,843
- Okay, I'm in.
- Great. Where do we get the shrooms?

73
00:04:17,294 --> 00:04:19,036
Eric roberts, where else?

74
00:04:20,585 --> 00:04:23,409
Let me see them hands.
I've got a shotgun pointed at the door.

75
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,602
Yo, E.R., chill.
It's Drama and Vince.

76
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:29,048
I'm just playing with you.

77
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,899
Good to see you.
Hey, how you doing?

78
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,318
- Eric.
- How you doing?

79
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,693
- Turtle.
- How are ya?

80
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:36,623
If it's not an ass
who needs wiping, Ari gold.

81
00:04:37,272 --> 00:04:38,558
How's it hanging, player?

82
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,783
- It's hanging.
- Been a long time, huh?

83
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:43,365
- Yeah, what 10 years, huh?
- About that.

84
00:04:43,485 --> 00:04:45,267
- How are you?
- Solid as a rock.

85
00:04:45,387 --> 00:04:48,166
In fact, take a fucking swing.
Abs of steel.

86
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:51,037
I'd rather not.

87
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,229
Either you swing or I do.

88
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,329
And don't jew me on this.
Put some muscle behind it.

89
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:04,724
50 years old, I'm still an animal.
Anybody else want to pound the stone?

90
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,582
- You want to pound this stone?
- No no.

91
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:09,646
No thanks.
We got a long drive ahead of us.

92
00:05:09,806 --> 00:05:11,975
We just came by to grab
some of your famous magical fungi

93
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:13,340
and we were gonna roll.

94
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,236
You'll be thrilled to know
I just harvested a sweet sweet batch.

95
00:05:16,396 --> 00:05:18,110
- Awesome.
- So where you guys going?

96
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,934
- Joshua Tree.
- Joshua Tree? I love that place.

97
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,493
Peace, serenity, nature.
Speaking of which, say hi to Mark.

98
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:26,621
What's the reason for this journey?

99
00:05:26,853 --> 00:05:29,399
I have a major
career decision to make.

100
00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:31,274
Heavy.

101
00:05:31,518 --> 00:05:34,380
You know,
I love observing people in transition.

102
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,038
It's good for my work.

103
00:05:36,158 --> 00:05:39,374
- Would you guys mind if I tagged along?
- No, you can come. It's cool.

104
00:05:39,494 --> 00:05:42,439
Actually, you know,
there's not enough room in my car.

105
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,090
That's okay, Gold.

106
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,732
We can take
my one- of-a-kind winnebago.

107
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:56,440
This is quite the ride, Eric.

108
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,068
Thanks.
Back in '91 me and this baby

109
00:05:59,188 --> 00:06:01,569
hit every one
of the continental 48 states,

110
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:04,367
with the exception of Montana
where I'm no longer legally welcome.

111
00:06:05,695 --> 00:06:08,649
Where we gonna sleep when we get there?
They have like a B&B or something?

112
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:11,551
Ha what? What's the plan?

113
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:14,982
You eat the shrooms, you trip,
you leave when you come down.

114
00:06:15,102 --> 00:06:17,590
Translation: you're sleeping,
you're sleeping in the dirt.

115
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,778
I don't even know
if I'm gonna be taking shrooms.

116
00:06:19,898 --> 00:06:22,862
Let's compromise. I can get us
a phat house at the Madison club.

117
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,096
Wake up, play a nice round
of golf in the am.

118
00:06:25,256 --> 00:06:27,741
- What do you say?
- Come on, it's man and nature.

119
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:30,607
You know how many good times this crew
has had without a real place to sleep?

120
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:33,647
Remember lake Barrington? All we had was
six bags of doritos and sleeping bags.

121
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:36,375
And Drama brought the extra bags,
he was still wetting the bed at 14.

122
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:38,638
Liar. I stopped wetting
the bed when I was nine.

123
00:06:38,758 --> 00:06:40,291
That extra bag was for warmth.

124
00:06:40,411 --> 00:06:42,613
You were still
wetting the bed at nine?

125
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:45,105
A lot of great artists
are late to potty-train.

126
00:06:45,401 --> 00:06:47,910
I was housebroken at 16 months.
True story.

127
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,989
True story,
we could be at Villa tonight.

128
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,592
- What are you gonna do at Villa?
- The only thing I can do,

129
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,527
find a nice image to whack off to.

130
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:59,130
- No phones on this trip.
- I need a dog-sitter, dickhead.

131
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,502
Make it fast or I'm gonna
chuck you and that device

132
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,296
out the door while we're moving.

133
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,719
Where the hell are you?

134
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,121
It's Saturday. I really don't think
that's any of your concern.

135
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:11,434
Your whereabouts are my concern
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

136
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,394
- So says you.
- <i>Are you trying</i>

137
00:07:13,554 --> 00:07:15,191
to put on a show to impress Tom?

138
00:07:15,354 --> 00:07:17,817
- No. Tom's not even here.
- <i>Really?</i>

139
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:20,318
- Tell him to suck it.
- <i>Tell him I heard that</i>

140
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:24,655
and tell him I will seal up your asshole
with cement if I am disrespected.

141
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,575
Stop it, Ari.
Stop it.

142
00:07:26,955 --> 00:07:29,028
It's Saturday
and I work 80 hours a week

143
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:32,163
and I should not have to be subjected
to this kind of talk on my weekend.

144
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:34,368
You're right.
Lloyd, I am sorry, okay?

145
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,667
This is not work related.
I need to ask you a favor.

146
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,745
- What kind of favor?
- I need you to watch Lily tonight.

147
00:07:39,865 --> 00:07:42,885
- Where is your family?
- Aunt Pearl's 75th in Santa Barbara.

148
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:46,052
- <i>And where are you</i>?
- I am away on business.

149
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,515
What kind of business
do you have on a Saturday night?

150
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,288
I got none of your fucking business.

151
00:07:50,408 --> 00:07:52,488
I got a wife who thinks
I'm under a pile of scripts

152
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:54,936
- and a dog that needs some love.
- We have plans tonight.

153
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:58,272
Well, break your fucking plans.
I own your asian ass.

154
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,066
I though this was a favor.

155
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:01,651
It is a favor to you.

156
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,596
<i>A favor to keep you employed.</i>

157
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:05,613
You are a manipulative meanie.

158
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:09,090
It's Katie Morgan.

159
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,576
What's up, ladies?

160
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,746
My regards to Tom.
Ciao.

161
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:17,642
Hey, Vince, are you coming
to Vegas for the A.V.N.S?

162
00:08:17,762 --> 00:08:19,794
Actually, we were going
to Joshua Tree.

163
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,490
Cool. I did a gang-bang
scene there last year.

164
00:08:22,873 --> 00:08:24,517
You want to do the sequel this year?

165
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,712
You guys should just come
to Vegas with us.

166
00:08:27,211 --> 00:08:28,721
Not this time, ladies.

167
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,543
We're sticking to the tree.

168
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,058
Okay, but it's gonna be
lonely out there.

169
00:08:34,486 --> 00:08:36,602
We will be thinking of you
the whole time.

170
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,378
Well thinkof this.

171
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,942
Let me get your number.

172
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,680
There's your image, Ari.

173
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,565
Stop being a baby.

174
00:08:47,685 --> 00:08:49,509
I'm being a baby
'cause I'm the one

175
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:52,045
who's gonna have
to call our friends and cancel again.

176
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:54,036
- It's just game night.
- Maybe to you.

177
00:08:54,546 --> 00:08:57,050
But for some of us it's a night
we look forward to all week.

178
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,834
- Do you want me to call everyone?
- No, I don't.

179
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,789
I want you to figure out
a way to save the evening.

180
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,895
- There's no way, Tom.
- Why don't we do it at Ari's?

181
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:07,675
- Please.
- Come on,

182
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:11,408
Think about it. It could be your own
personal "fuck you" to Ari Gold.

183
00:09:11,528 --> 00:09:13,505
Fuck you to you.
There's no way.

184
00:09:13,908 --> 00:09:16,210
Don't be a pussy, Lloyd.
Come on.

185
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,446
All right, I will be responsible.

186
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:21,107
If I don't make the place
absolutely perfect,

187
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,453
even more perfect
than when we arrive,

188
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:26,856
you can tie me up
and put me in the kennel for the day.

189
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:28,882
You always say I can't.

190
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:31,603
Well, I won't fail,
but, you know, if I do...

191
00:09:52,795 --> 00:09:54,995
This is where we'll find answers.

192
00:09:55,563 --> 00:09:56,599
Everyone out.

193
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,341
Phones and berries in the hat.

194
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:03,179
- Even you, Ari.
- I've got kids, fuckhead.

195
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:06,661
You bring any negative energy
to the tree, I'm gonna crush your larynx

196
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:09,697
and leave your rotting corpse here
for the coyotes to eat.

197
00:10:10,497 --> 00:10:12,250
We got to hang more often, E.R.

198
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,961
Let him keep his phone.

199
00:10:14,591 --> 00:10:16,327
Whatever.
You got the bag?

200
00:10:17,103 --> 00:10:19,079
Bags--
Just in case.

201
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:21,958
- Uno, dos.
- We're gonna take 'em right now?

202
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:23,906
You want to say a few words first?

203
00:10:24,026 --> 00:10:26,599
No, I just thought
we'd settle in first, you know?

204
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:27,982
E's nervous.

205
00:10:28,813 --> 00:10:30,453
I'm not one for babysitting,

206
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:33,055
so if it's your first time,
I'm recommending half an eighth.

207
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,815
- It's not my first time.
- Uh, yes it is.

208
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,032
I ate a stem once.

209
00:10:37,152 --> 00:10:39,029
Yeah, but you threw it up
30 seconds after.

210
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:42,908
Which is why I made you a peanut
butter and shroom sandwich this time.

211
00:10:44,732 --> 00:10:45,773
Thanks, Drama.

212
00:10:46,109 --> 00:10:48,350
You pack a lunch for the rest of us
or just junior?

213
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,202
You work for us, Ari.
We don't work for you. Sorry.

214
00:10:51,322 --> 00:10:52,863
All right, let's do it.

215
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:54,747
Not here.

216
00:10:55,826 --> 00:10:56,855
Where then?

217
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:08,355
- Here.
- I like it.

218
00:11:09,513 --> 00:11:11,885
- Here we go.
- All right, come on. Let's eat.

219
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,136
Here we go.

220
00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:18,764
What, peer pressure?
Fine.

221
00:11:29,348 --> 00:11:32,146
- It tastes like shit.
- That's 'cause they're grown in shit.

222
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:33,606
This your first time too?

223
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,656
I thought everybody
ate shrooms in the '60s.

224
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:39,535
I was born in '67, fatboy.
I never wanted to do a drug

225
00:11:39,695 --> 00:11:42,082
that made me lose control.
You don't lose control,

226
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,671
just all of your stresses.

227
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:44,810
Exactly.

228
00:11:45,316 --> 00:11:48,575
At this moment,
none of us have a care in the world.

229
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:54,028
Everybody, welcome.

230
00:12:07,954 --> 00:12:09,543
I don't feel anything.

231
00:12:10,527 --> 00:12:12,768
It's coming, Ari.
It's coming.

232
00:12:12,986 --> 00:12:14,473
Feeling anything, E?

233
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:17,461
Can we please
let Turtle finish his story?

234
00:12:17,581 --> 00:12:19,742
I don't want to hear
about his first hand-job.

235
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,421
- At least it was a job.
- Some of us are interested.

236
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,425
Remember, the journey
begins at the beginning.

237
00:12:25,607 --> 00:12:27,541
So, Turtle, please, go on.

238
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:31,168
Anyway, she was slamming.
Even Vince thought so. Remember, Vince?

239
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:35,085
Listen, I hate to miss this,
but it's the wife. Hold on.

240
00:12:36,729 --> 00:12:38,969
We could kill him
and no one would know.

241
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,265
- Hey, baby, is that you?
- I can't really hear you.

242
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,660
Can you hear me?

243
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:47,269
I can hear you, honey.

244
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,397
Hi. Listen,
I just wanted to tell you

245
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:51,576
I think we're coming home tonight.

246
00:12:52,015 --> 00:12:53,722
You're coming home tonight?

247
00:12:54,248 --> 00:12:55,655
No, honey, why--

248
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,692
Honey, why would you
come home tonight?

249
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:04,995
- She's coming home tonight.
- So what?

250
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,333
So I'm here,
I'm supposed to be there.

251
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,204
I don't have any reception.

252
00:13:09,577 --> 00:13:11,399
You're walking around in circles.

253
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,375
I'm trying to get a signal.

254
00:13:13,495 --> 00:13:16,090
I understand. That's why
I was gonna tell you to head up.

255
00:13:17,674 --> 00:13:18,896
- Up?
- Up.

256
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:23,180
I'd hurry though.
You'll be tripping soon enough.

257
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,018
- Christ.
- Don't tell him that.

258
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,775
Hey, don't worry.
You're fine.

259
00:13:26,895 --> 00:13:30,175
It's a slow-acting batch.
You've got 10, 15 minutes.

260
00:13:32,302 --> 00:13:35,379
- Can he really get service up there?
- I have no idea.

261
00:13:47,012 --> 00:13:48,703
I think I feel something.

262
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,066
Maybe it was a fast-acting batch.

263
00:13:59,196 --> 00:14:00,764
Maya, get off.

264
00:14:01,798 --> 00:14:04,569
Maya, would you leave
your cousin alone?

265
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:06,793
Sarah, could you do something?

266
00:14:07,038 --> 00:14:08,138
Like what?

267
00:14:09,636 --> 00:14:11,123
Hey, can you hear me?

268
00:14:12,588 --> 00:14:14,523
- Why are you coming home tonight?
- I'm coming

269
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:17,109
home because
your son is throwing a fit.

270
00:14:17,445 --> 00:14:18,819
But it'll be night soon.

271
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,277
- It'll be night soon.
- You just said that.

272
00:14:25,076 --> 00:14:27,937
It'll be night soon
and it's a long drive.

273
00:14:28,324 --> 00:14:30,498
- You wait till morning.
- <i>I would love to</i>.

274
00:14:30,795 --> 00:14:33,686
- Just get your son to agree.
- <i>Let me talk to him</i>.

275
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:36,003
Jonah, it's your father.

276
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:44,220
Listen, don't cry.
You're gonna make daddy cry.

277
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:46,555
I just want to go home.

278
00:14:47,116 --> 00:14:48,135
I know.

279
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,476
Tell mama to take me home.

280
00:14:50,812 --> 00:14:51,892
Buddy...

281
00:14:54,592 --> 00:14:56,607
I'll give you $100
if you stay till tomorrow.

282
00:14:57,349 --> 00:14:58,368
Really?

283
00:14:58,977 --> 00:15:00,988
- Really.
- And a transformer?

284
00:15:01,476 --> 00:15:03,864
You got it.
Now will you stay?

285
00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:09,061
I love you.

286
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,857
I bugged chewy top.

287
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,511
What did you say?
What?

288
00:15:12,631 --> 00:15:14,260
I said I love you a lot.

289
00:15:15,197 --> 00:15:16,623
- Bye.
- Bye.

290
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,737
Okay, we can stay.

291
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:26,758
My hands are huge.
Why are my hands huge?

292
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:34,797
Where the fuck am I?

293
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,371
Oh no no no no.

294
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,568
Benji.

295
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,300
Hey, say it.

296
00:15:59,099 --> 00:16:00,402
No no, like this.

297
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:05,410
It feels nice to say.

298
00:16:05,838 --> 00:16:07,280
Maybe that's a sign.

299
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,100
The script floats.

300
00:16:10,227 --> 00:16:11,694
Maybe that's a sign.

301
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:19,726
- Should we read it?
- Now?

302
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:21,617
I couldn't read it now.

303
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,573
Maybe E could read it.

304
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,333
E can't read it.

305
00:16:29,618 --> 00:16:31,650
The answer's not in that script.

306
00:16:32,346 --> 00:16:33,996
The answer's out there,

307
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:40,502
- Ari's still out there.
- He's been out there a while.

308
00:16:41,446 --> 00:16:42,963
Maybe he found the answer.

309
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:46,136
- I wish he'd come share it with us.
- I don't.

310
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,094
I like us.

311
00:16:50,739 --> 00:16:53,693
- We should find him, though.
- I don't want to go anywhere.

312
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:56,268
If Vince thinks we have to move,
we have to move.

313
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,188
I don't want to move.

314
00:16:59,106 --> 00:17:00,314
I want to create.

315
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:02,414
Do you want to move, E?

316
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,847
I want to move.

317
00:17:10,818 --> 00:17:12,451
See you on the flip side, kid.

318
00:17:16,108 --> 00:17:17,367
Wait up for me.

319
00:17:17,876 --> 00:17:19,137
I'm gonna pee.

320
00:17:23,151 --> 00:17:24,292
I feel cold.

321
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:27,091
I don't like being cold.
Maybe that's a sign.

322
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,343
Maybe we should keep
a list of possible signs.

323
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:31,595
E, can you keep a list?

324
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:38,769
What's up?

325
00:17:39,732 --> 00:17:41,741
I thought I pulled my cock off.

326
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:42,827
Oh, Jesus!

327
00:17:43,488 --> 00:17:45,359
- It's okay. I didn't.
- This way.

328
00:17:50,357 --> 00:17:51,602
Where's ahnold?

329
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,138
He's right there.
I've been watching him.

330
00:17:57,027 --> 00:17:58,038
That's a rock.

331
00:18:00,364 --> 00:18:02,297
- Really?
- Are you kidding me?

332
00:18:11,804 --> 00:18:13,210
Anybody!

333
00:18:26,983 --> 00:18:28,857
All right, listen up.
So remember,

334
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:31,445
the category
is fact or fiction.

335
00:18:31,747 --> 00:18:33,092
I want to buy a vowel.

336
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:35,353
Oh no.
Everyone, quiet.

337
00:18:35,694 --> 00:18:38,055
- An E.
- Is there an E, vanna?

338
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,236
Tom, it's Ari.
Shut the hell up.

339
00:18:46,273 --> 00:18:48,855
Hello, Ari. Lily is great.
The house immaculate.

340
00:18:48,975 --> 00:18:51,091
I love the new fabric
on the dining room chairs.

341
00:18:51,211 --> 00:18:53,302
Fabric? No no, fabric.
What are you saying?

342
00:18:53,735 --> 00:18:54,794
Oh God, no.

343
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:57,931
Can you hear me?

344
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:00,184
Yes, I can hear you.
Am I not hearing you?

345
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,733
I'm freaking out.

346
00:19:02,853 --> 00:19:05,439
- No need to. Everything's fine.
- <i>No, it's not fine</i>.

347
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,120
I am alone,

348
00:19:07,598 --> 00:19:08,495
and...

349
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,095
I am lost,
and I am

350
00:19:11,603 --> 00:19:12,907
hallucinating.

351
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:15,282
- What do you mean?
- <i>How long has it been</i>

352
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:18,653
since I have seen you, Lloyd?

353
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,955
Can you come
to where I am?

354
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,373
What is going on?

355
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:26,445
I have eaten some mushrooms.

356
00:19:26,926 --> 00:19:28,248
Magic mushrooms?

357
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:29,890
I hate magic

358
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,776
and magicians, Lloyd.

359
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:34,788
One time this magician
made my watch appear

360
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:37,171
in a bottle of beer
and I did not like it.

361
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,086
I don't trust magic, Lloyd.

362
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:42,059
Oh no.
You should not hallucinate alone.

363
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,331
Don't be mean.

364
00:19:43,451 --> 00:19:45,813
The first rule of tripping
is stick to the buddy system.

365
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,510
Who is watching you?

366
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:50,772
I hope no one is watching me.

367
00:19:51,645 --> 00:19:54,321
The bigger the shoe size
the bigger the cock!

368
00:19:54,597 --> 00:19:56,490
- What was that?
- What was what?

369
00:19:57,557 --> 00:19:59,785
I thought I heard something.
Was that there or here?

370
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,815
It was nowhere.
Don't be paranoid.

371
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:03,368
Shut the fuck up!

372
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:08,001
Now start from the beginning. How did
you get yourself in this predicament?

373
00:20:16,388 --> 00:20:20,032
If we could only find one of them,
Ari or ahnold, who would you pick?

374
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,469
You can't ask questions
that can't be answered.

375
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,430
I could answer that.
Ahnold.

376
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:25,678
Why?

377
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:28,425
You can replace an agent.
You can't replace a best friend.

378
00:20:28,545 --> 00:20:31,490
What if we could have
Ahnold's soul in Ari's body?

379
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:34,114
Then my agent
would have the soul of a dog

380
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,885
and would want me to do <i>Benji</i>.

381
00:20:36,005 --> 00:20:38,525
How do you know Ahnold's
soul even likes Benji?

382
00:20:38,645 --> 00:20:40,318
I don't know.
I just know.

383
00:20:40,793 --> 00:20:42,850
Unless his running away was a sign.

384
00:20:43,623 --> 00:20:44,927
Write it down, E.

385
00:20:46,408 --> 00:20:47,662
Got anything yet?

386
00:20:48,651 --> 00:20:50,497
Why isn't he saying anything?

387
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:51,676
You okay, E?

388
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,165
"My mouth won't talk."

389
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,966
- Trippy.
- Totally.

390
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,196
- When is it gonna end?
- <i>Soon, Ari.</i>

391
00:21:18,356 --> 00:21:19,907
Soon.
Do you see anything yet?

392
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,276
Just rocks and dust and trees

393
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:24,097
and tiny little goblins.

394
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:27,152
It's important to remember
what's real and not real.

395
00:21:27,272 --> 00:21:30,038
You know what?
I've always mocked it,

396
00:21:30,158 --> 00:21:33,337
but now I know it.
You are Confucius.

397
00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:35,756
I think you're becoming yourself again.

398
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,045
Confucius--

399
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,384
Confucius say Ari go...

400
00:21:40,295 --> 00:21:41,303
<i>No, come on.</i>

401
00:21:43,007 --> 00:21:46,084
Confucius say Ari go...

402
00:21:51,951 --> 00:21:54,580
Go where?
You're supposed to say go where.

403
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,447
Something is coming for me.

404
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,282
Nothing's coming for you.

405
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,323
I'm serious.
I just heard something.

406
00:22:04,466 --> 00:22:06,892
Just count to five
and you'll see it's just in your head.

407
00:22:07,012 --> 00:22:09,289
One two three four--
It's coming closer.

408
00:22:12,154 --> 00:22:14,590
- I'm looking at two eyes.
- <i>Are you sure?</i>

409
00:22:15,484 --> 00:22:16,502
Oh God.

410
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,550
Confucius say,
you are sure?

411
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,302
- Positive.
- Then run!

412
00:22:27,404 --> 00:22:28,824
Where are you, boy?

413
00:22:29,352 --> 00:22:32,000
I can make him like me
if I do this.

414
00:22:35,665 --> 00:22:37,763
I like you.
It worked.

415
00:22:39,672 --> 00:22:42,447
- Who do you want to like you?
- Everybody already likes you, Vince.

416
00:22:43,924 --> 00:22:46,491
He who must not be named
does not like me.

417
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:49,913
I was mean
and I didn't do <i>Aquaman 2</i>.

418
00:22:51,268 --> 00:22:53,166
And now I can't be a firefighter.

419
00:22:54,267 --> 00:22:56,837
Why are you so attached
to this <i>Smokejumpers</i> thing?

420
00:22:57,049 --> 00:22:58,089
Because

421
00:22:59,362 --> 00:23:02,342
E found the script and it's good.
And I want to be good.

422
00:23:02,705 --> 00:23:05,432
And I want us to be good
to make up for the bad.

423
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:08,654
Everyone must know
that E makes Vince good.

424
00:23:10,253 --> 00:23:12,599
You and E really have
something special.

425
00:23:13,047 --> 00:23:14,271
E is a true friend.

426
00:23:14,786 --> 00:23:15,845
What do I got?

427
00:23:15,965 --> 00:23:17,760
You're a true friend too, Turtle.

428
00:23:18,411 --> 00:23:20,916
I got no job,
no purpose,

429
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,773
- No dog.
- Oh, Turtle.

430
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,427
I have no E.

431
00:23:26,547 --> 00:23:28,809
E can't talk
and it's really freaking me out!

432
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:31,556
- I can make E talk.
- I want to call my mom.

433
00:23:32,399 --> 00:23:34,070
Make E talk, Johnny.

434
00:23:42,597 --> 00:23:43,738
Are you back?

435
00:23:44,472 --> 00:23:46,652
Call your mom in the morning, Turtle.

436
00:23:51,587 --> 00:23:53,481
You don't want to do <i>Benji</i>.

437
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:56,396
I want a true sign.

438
00:23:58,009 --> 00:23:59,872
I want to find Turtle's doggy.

439
00:24:11,313 --> 00:24:13,038
I think I just heard Drama.

440
00:24:13,158 --> 00:24:14,926
Confucius say run to him.

441
00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:22,738
Ahnold can't talk.

442
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:25,565
Maybe only I can understand him.

443
00:24:27,326 --> 00:24:29,888
No, I can understand him.
He's talking to Drama.

444
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,899
That's Ari.

445
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,622
Something's after me!

446
00:24:36,304 --> 00:24:37,404
Oh my God!

447
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:41,738
I've never been
so fucking freaked out in my life.

448
00:24:43,237 --> 00:24:44,431
I'm happy!

449
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:47,280
 -I'm even happy to see E.
- Thanks, Ari.

450
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,598
It's Anold!
It's Anold!

451
00:24:51,264 --> 00:24:53,974
Where were you, boy?
Where'd you go?

452
00:24:54,904 --> 00:24:56,998
Because I thought
I was never gonna see you again.

453
00:25:01,384 --> 00:25:03,116
- That's it.
- What's what?

454
00:25:05,238 --> 00:25:06,413
What, Vinnie?

455
00:25:08,704 --> 00:25:09,716
You're it.

456
00:25:10,122 --> 00:25:11,596
Now Vince is freaking me out.

457
00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:13,598
No, Ahnold found Ari.

458
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,274
And Ari found <i>Benji</i>
and they found us.

459
00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:23,650
- E gets it.
- Gets what?

460
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:26,253
I don't understand what he means.

461
00:25:26,373 --> 00:25:28,614
He means the tree has spoken.

462
00:25:29,727 --> 00:25:31,214
We're doing <i>Benji</i>.

463
00:25:52,097 --> 00:25:53,597
I can't believe you made these.

464
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,698
You like 'em?

465
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:57,642
I love them.

466
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:00,045
You're still tripping.

467
00:26:00,248 --> 00:26:01,307
You're not?

468
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:03,209
Are you guys?

469
00:26:03,731 --> 00:26:06,067
I don't know.
How do you know when it's over?

470
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:07,861
It's over.

471
00:26:08,356 --> 00:26:11,418
It might not be.
We might be hallucinating this.

472
00:26:12,311 --> 00:26:13,995
We might not even be here.

473
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:16,053
No, we're here.

474
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:21,201
Is this real or is my wife
calling me at 2:00 a.m.?

475
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:23,335
Your wife is calling you at 2:00 a.m.

476
00:26:24,735 --> 00:26:26,338
- <i>Everything okay?</i>
- Where are you?

477
00:26:26,498 --> 00:26:28,525
I'm home, honey.
Where are you?

478
00:26:28,645 --> 00:26:29,502
I'm home.

479
00:26:30,348 --> 00:26:32,639
- I went for a jog.
- At 2:00 am?

480
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,007
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

481
00:26:34,172 --> 00:26:37,724
Well, how could you with 25 men
frolicking naked in our pool?

482
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:41,115
- Baby--

483
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:52,792
I don't know who's more dead,
me or fucking Lloyd.

484
00:26:53,006 --> 00:26:54,718
Hey, E.R.,
I know you hate me,

485
00:26:54,838 --> 00:26:56,963
but is there any way
you could drive really fast?

486
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,990
Not much faster I can go.

487
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:02,717
Something has occurred.
Look.

488
00:27:05,328 --> 00:27:06,503
Holy shit!

489
00:27:09,185 --> 00:27:11,243
You think that's the victim's girl?

490
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:13,218
Great rack.

491
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:37,888
I don't know, guys.
I think I am still tripping.

492
00:27:38,383 --> 00:27:41,040
Snap out of it 'cause I need for you
to come home with me tonight

493
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,443
and do some real acting
for the wife, okay?

494
00:27:43,677 --> 00:27:45,001
Yeah, sure, Ari.

495
00:27:45,837 --> 00:27:47,680
But forget <i>Benji</i>.
I'm not doing it.

496
00:27:48,062 --> 00:27:49,883
- Really?
- What happened, bro?

497
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:52,306
Suddenly it just doesn't feel right.

498
00:27:52,426 --> 00:27:54,775
I'm glad you said it
'cause I couldn't.

499
00:27:55,587 --> 00:27:57,490
So what are you gonna do now?

500
00:27:58,084 --> 00:27:59,102
Wing it.

501
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:01,389
I'll get a job.
Help us out.

502
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:04,394
Turtle's gonna get a job.
If that's not the biggest sign of all.

503
00:28:04,554 --> 00:28:06,652
Listen, you may be dead
as a doornail right now

504
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:09,869
but we will get you a job before Turtle.
That I'm sure of.

505
00:28:10,496 --> 00:28:11,704
That's great, Ari.

506
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:13,242
But get me <i>Smokejumpers</i>.

507
00:28:13,918 --> 00:28:16,518
I got a better chance
