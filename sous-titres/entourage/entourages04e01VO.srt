00:00:13,454 --> 00:00:14,609
Mark!

3
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:20,466
<i>Medellin</i> is the story of Pablo Escobar,

4
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,366
one of the greatest outlaws
the world had ever known.

5
00:00:23,512 --> 00:00:25,539
And what attracted you to this project?

6
00:00:26,046 --> 00:00:28,742
What attracted me to this project?

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,214
Everything.

8
00:00:32,345 --> 00:00:35,341
It was the script for me. The first time
I read it, I couldn't put it down.

9
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:37,073
I knew it was a movie,
an exciting movie.

10
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:41,035
What attracted me to this project?
Well, that's easy.

11
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,986
It was the blood.

00:01:42,141 --> 00:01:45,891

<i>On September the 3rd, 2006,</i>

20
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:17,814
<i>a completely independently
financed movie crew</i>

21
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:19,841
<i>set out into the hills of Colombia</i>

22
00:02:20,017 --> 00:02:23,575
<i>to make a movie about one of the most
feared drug lords in history.</i>

23
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:26,811
<i>A young director,
first-time producer,</i>

24
00:02:26,974 --> 00:02:29,518
<i>and an up-and-coming
movie star all had one goal...</i>

00:02:31,065 --> 00:02:32,393
People, people!

27
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:34,757
<i>I was invited along
to document the ride.</i>

28
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,944
Gather around!
Gather around!

29
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:41,712
Everyone take a moment.
Breath in the air.

30
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,987
Focus on your surroundings.
This is now your home.

31
00:02:46,982 --> 00:02:48,986
Everything you left behind
is behind you.

32
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:50,819
Whether it be your wife,
your children,

33
00:02:50,932 --> 00:02:53,836
or your fucking cocker spaniel
named Lucy, none of them matters.

34
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,988
The only thing that matters
is what you can see.

35
00:02:57,493 --> 00:02:58,507
Thank you.

36
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:03,241
I knew going into this
that Billy was gonna be a handful.

37
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,740
It was my job to handle him
and bring the movie in on budget.

38
00:03:05,806 --> 00:03:07,179
But you have no experience.

39
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,353
No, none, actually.

40
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,649
In fact, four years ago,
I was running a pizza place.

41
00:03:11,785 --> 00:03:14,735
And now they put you in charge
of a $30-million budget?

42
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,750
Only in Hollywood, right?

43
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:18,950
So how do you know what to do?

44
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,373
I mean, you don't.
You learn on the job. You have to.

45
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,399
And he has this book to help.

46
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,550
He reads it every night.
He keeps it under his pillow.

47
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:28,337
I have read it about 60 times.

48
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,242
Okay, next scene up,

49
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,897
scene 167...

50
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,498
The storming of Pablo's private prison.

51
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,509
Okay, how many extras will we have?

52
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,027
400, just like the script asked for.

53
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:41,479
It ain't enough.

54
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:43,439
It's what the script says.

55
00:03:43,552 --> 00:03:45,065
It needs to be overwhelming.

56
00:03:45,155 --> 00:03:46,551
We need to fill the whole frame.

57
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,092
I'd say another 1,000 will do it.

58
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:50,252
This is the real Clombian army
we're getting here.

59
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,550
We're getting them cheap.

60
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:53,695
Can't just throw another 1,000
even at that price.

61
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,338
Turn your motherfucking cell phones off.

62
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,549
Sorry, it's my bad.
There hasn't been any service.

63
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,158
That is the last fucking cell phone

64
00:03:59,226 --> 00:04:01,950
that I wanna hear in the next 45 days
that we spend together.

65
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:03,650
I'm telling you all right now,

66
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,337
if another cell phone rings

67
00:04:05,405 --> 00:04:07,288
while professional artists
are trying to work,

68
00:04:07,355 --> 00:04:08,819
the responsible
for that distraction

69
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:10,867
will be dragged into town
and sold as a drug mule.

70
00:04:10,913 --> 00:04:12,646
Does everyone understand
what I'm saying?

71
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,430
It was my bad, okay? But there really
hasn't been any cell phone service.

72
00:04:17,551 --> 00:04:18,969
I think the guy overreacted.

73
00:04:19,137 --> 00:04:21,523
It's just a production meeting.
Not like I blew a shot.

74
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,097
And it's Sunday.
I got to get my football picks in.

75
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,472
I always try to steer my clients away

76
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:28,823
from working with
inexperienced directors and producers,

77
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:30,362
because why take a chance?

78
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,844
Vinnie really wanted to do this movie
and there was no stopping him.

79
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,888
But then, when he wanted
to put up his own money,

80
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,149
I thought that was crazy,

81
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,627
because, look,
most movies lose money.

82
00:04:39,782 --> 00:04:42,056
It's my job as a talent representative

83
00:04:42,123 --> 00:04:44,870
to make sure that even if a movie
loses all of its money,

84
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:46,950
my client still sees all of his.

85
00:04:49,352 --> 00:04:51,349
I've never heard you
mention this problem before.

86
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,284
Makes no difference.
I'm telling you now.

87
00:04:53,345 --> 00:04:55,650
Make sure a crane can
pull right through there. Got it?

88
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,450
- Have you heard it?
- I haven't heard it.

89
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,842
- You don't disagree?
- No, I don't. Do you?

90
00:04:59,927 --> 00:05:02,230
I don't know 'cause I haven't heard
what the problem is.

91
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:04,349
The problem, suit, is that
we don't have an ending.

92
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,650
I'm sorry, let me correct that.
We have a shitty ending.

93
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,350
An endinthat will take a genius film
that people are loving,

94
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:10,948
turn them on a dime against us,

95
00:05:10,993 --> 00:05:14,550
and have them walking out of the theater
shaking their fucking heads in disgust.

96
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,950
We're supposed to shoot in three days.

97
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,095
The guy suddenly tells us that
he hates the ending? So what do you do?

98
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:22,813
Shoot yourself in the head

99
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,704
with a large-caliber bullet.

100
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:27,705
- I say we shut down for a week.
- No!

101
00:05:27,763 --> 00:05:29,929
We work on the ending...
It'll cost us a little money,

102
00:05:29,952 --> 00:05:32,894
but if we start shooting and then
have to shut down it'll be disastrous.

103
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:34,527
We'll have something to shoot.

104
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:37,150
I'm ready to roll.
I don't want to slow down.

105
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,339
- So we're in agreement.
- It's up to E.

106
00:05:41,423 --> 00:05:44,321
Don't worry, suit.
I promise we'll have something to shoot.

107
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,450
I'll write it and it will be brilliant.
I promise, okay?

108
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,450
- Okay.
- All right!

109
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,444
You don't get on a set,
get ready to shoot,

110
00:05:57,562 --> 00:05:58,733
and then ask for rewrites.

111
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,271
Studios do this crap all the time

112
00:06:00,316 --> 00:06:02,335
and they wonder why
they end up with a shit movie.

113
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:04,474
Movie? You know, I hate
the word "movie."

114
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,879
I don't make movies.
I make films.

115
00:06:07,321 --> 00:06:08,964
You think you're invincible.

116
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,046
Nobody invincible.

117
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,042
Nothing is forever, Mr. Escobar.

118
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,302
I appreciate your position,
Senor de Quintas.

119
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,889
I know you have a job
and a family to provide for.

120
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,142
- Three boys, no?
- Are you threatening me?

121
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:25,092
Nobody is threatening nobody.

122
00:06:25,977 --> 00:06:27,463
Well, actually, I'm not in the movie.

123
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,679
I'm just sitting in
on the table read as a favor

124
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,402
until they find the real actor.

125
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,795
You see, I'm not available.
I'm on a tv show...

126
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,950
<i>Five Towns.</i>

127
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,317
we had a very successful first season.

128
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,148
And even though I'm on hiatus,

129
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,955
I can't be in the movie.
Contractually I'm not available.

130
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,034
Plus Billy didn't
really offer me anything.

131
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,650
The Cali cartel is a figment
of your imagination, Pablo.

132
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,892
They are ghosts.

133
00:06:57,293 --> 00:06:58,892
When's the next casting session?

134
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:01,903
If I have to listen to anymore amateurs
I'm gonna slash my wrists.

135
00:07:01,948 --> 00:07:04,050
You want me to try that
with an accent, billy?

136
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:20,350
- What I would do to that.
- Be professional.

137
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,787
Okay, let's read through this once.

138
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,557
I can read with.

139
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:29,310
We can leave the kiss out.
Or not.

140
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,642
Why are they in here?
Get them out.

141
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:33,321
You guys got to go.

142
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,450
Good luck.

143
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,902
Sorry about that.

144
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,102
Okay, let's do this.

145
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,044
- I'm a little bit nervous.
- No, don't be.

146
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:59,004
- So, what do you think?
- she's fantastic.

147
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,187
I loved her, but we're talking
about the village girl.

148
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,335
And?

149
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,153
- It's just not how I saw her.
- No? How did you see her?

150
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,967
Kind of like Linda Hunt
in <i>The Year of Living Dangerously.</i>

151
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,871
- Really?
- What, you saw Salma Hayek?

152
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,028
I didn't see Salma Hayek
when that girl just read.

153
00:08:13,096 --> 00:08:14,897
Have some fucking imagination, suit.

154
00:08:14,932 --> 00:08:17,449
Makeup, wardrobe.
She can be more plain as you say,

155
00:08:17,578 --> 00:08:20,009
but her essence
is something special.

156
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,456
- Agreed, Vince?
- Yeah, agreed. E?

157
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,114
Okay, makeup.

158
00:08:24,205 --> 00:08:26,434
Any shot she'll have a nude
scene in the film, Bill?

159
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,463
Well, I didn't see it personally,

160
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:31,247
but what I did believe was
that Billy knew exactly what he wanted.

161
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:33,743
So it's my job to support him as long
as he got it all done.

162
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:35,450
And the ending,
has he got that done?

163
00:08:35,893 --> 00:08:37,717
- Not yet.
- So what do you do?

164
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,137
I support him for now.

165
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:43,840
EIGHT WEEKS LATER (del vo)

166
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:55,062
<i>October the 27th.
The first day of production had arrived.</i>

167
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,019
<i>The sets were all up.</i>

168
00:08:57,118 --> 00:08:58,357
Why is that door red?

169
00:08:59,111 --> 00:09:00,687
- I thought it popped.
- It popped?

170
00:09:00,732 --> 00:09:03,343
How am I going to see
blood splatter on a red door?

171
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,267
Fuckwad.
Change it.

172
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,513
The actors were all cast.

173
00:09:07,565 --> 00:09:09,186
Show some fucking fire!

174
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:21,463
As soon as I get this on, vinnie,

175
00:09:21,553 --> 00:09:24,306
we'll put that other eye in for you
and it'll be perfect.

176
00:09:25,033 --> 00:09:26,474
The makeup tests were all done.

177
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,653
- Hey, billy!
- Holy shit.

178
00:09:28,721 --> 00:09:32,350
That can't be vincent chase.
Don't hurt me, Don Pablo! Don't hurt me.

179
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,188
Beautiful job.

180
00:09:34,256 --> 00:09:35,516
Thank you, thank you.

181
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,019
The nose needs to be more thick.

182
00:09:37,099 --> 00:09:39,879
No, that's a very accurate rendering.
He looks just like Pablo.

183
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,757
Thicken it or I'll find someone who can.

184
00:09:41,846 --> 00:09:43,242
And don't put too much on her.

185
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,419
She's perfect as is.

186
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,350
<i>They're ready to shoot.</i>

187
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,506
<i>I need quiet on the set, please.</i>

188
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,649
Of course I'm nervous.

189
00:09:51,748 --> 00:09:53,527
It's only natural.
Who wouldn't be nervous?

190
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:55,981
- I don't really get nervous.
- Only pussies get nervous.

191
00:09:56,044 --> 00:09:58,573
I'm freaking out a little bit.
It's all on the line on this one

192
00:09:58,618 --> 00:10:00,283
and I have no control.
I don't like that.

193
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,277
Well, whenever you're about to shoot

194
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,769
you get butterflies.

195
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,432
But if you've prepared
and taken care of your instrument,

196
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,069
what can go wrong?

197
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,499
Tony Danza taught me that
when I did a little guest spot.

198
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,137
We're about to roll out of film.

199
00:10:14,036 --> 00:10:15,432
We're gonna roll out of film.

200
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,250
Can I finish my story here?

201
00:10:23,488 --> 00:10:25,402
Scene 16, take one.

202
00:10:46,632 --> 00:10:48,500
How are you, my friend? (del vo)

203
00:10:49,446 --> 00:10:53,420
Parton, I have asked the men and we do not know where the missing kilos gave gone. (del vo)

204
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,135
That is very bad news. (del vo)

205
00:10:58,873 --> 00:11:01,147
Perhaps there has been a mistake. (del vo)

206
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:08,204
Perhaps you should ask them again. As a favor for me, my friend? (del vo)

207
00:11:09,464 --> 00:11:11,040
Yes, of course. (del vo)

208
00:11:13,505 --> 00:11:15,891
Nino, will you come play a little game with me? (del vo)

209
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,432
Come on, will you ever
doubt the guy again?

210
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:29,849
That shit looked unbelievable.

211
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,029
- Is this kid a movie star or what?
- Did you like it?

212
00:12:32,096 --> 00:12:34,948
If I don't get a little something
in this movie, I'm gonna kill myself.

213
00:12:34,993 --> 00:12:36,150
I guess he likes.

214
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,887
There he is!

215
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:41,140
The auteur extraordinaire.
Awesome, Billy.

216
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,986
Bravo, Billy.
Bravo.

217
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,174
What's wrong?

218
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,609
- I hate it.
- You hate it?

219
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:48,202
- I hate it.
- Why? It looks great.

220
00:12:48,305 --> 00:12:50,624
It looks like shit.
Like a hallmark hall of fame movie.

221
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,249
Hey, I did a couple
good hallmark hall of fame movies.

222
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,523
Over lit, man.
Dripping in shit.

223
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,779
You jammed that D.P.
down my throat,

224
00:12:57,847 --> 00:12:59,652
and this is what happens
when I get jammed.

225
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,924
- You picked the D.P.
- Off your list, suit.

226
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:03,680
Your budget fucking list.

227
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,749
You go budget,
you get a budget-ass look.

228
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,911
- I swear it looks great.
- Vince, I love you,

229
00:13:07,956 --> 00:13:09,937
but I swear it don't.
It looks like shit.

230
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,563
I feel like crying,
I hate it so much. I hate it!

231
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,947
- Here comes Sven. Chill out.
- I hate it, I hate it.

232
00:13:15,948 --> 00:13:17,220
- Hey!
- Enough.

233
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:18,561
We loving life, huh?

234
00:13:18,628 --> 00:13:21,050
I hate it! I hate it!
I fucking hate it!

235
00:13:23,374 --> 00:13:26,751
Your filters make it look like
someone came on the lens.

236
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,750
- Get off of him.
- You big fucking Scandinavian pussy!

237
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,350
I thought it looked great,
but I'm not a cinematographer.

238
00:13:33,695 --> 00:13:36,059
If billy thought that
it could look better,I believed him.

239
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,747
I believed him too.
But still, we have a budget

240
00:13:38,815 --> 00:13:41,250
and I wouldn't have
let him fire the guy. But I had no say.

241
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,150
After Billy humiliated him he quit.

242
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,225
That always a good sign, right?
When the director starts offing people.

243
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:47,860
Yeah, big fucking deal.

244
00:13:47,973 --> 00:13:50,450
I decided to shoot the thing myself,
save us some money.

245
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,950
You're fearful.

246
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:54,943
Like this is the most feared man
in Colombia, right?

247
00:13:55,055 --> 00:13:57,959
But you know that
he lusts after you.

248
00:13:58,903 --> 00:14:00,592
But I'm only selling bananas.

249
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:04,967
- Why aren't we shooting?
- I just act, kid.

250
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,650
What the fuck is going on?

251
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:10,747
I think your director's got a crush.

252
00:14:10,805 --> 00:14:13,935
Don't burst his bubble,
but she's been eyeing me for days.

253
00:14:18,036 --> 00:14:19,250
Why aren't we shooting?

254
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,909
- The light's not right.
- When's it going to be right?

255
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,253
When the clouds move.

256
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,550
When's that going to be?

257
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,850
I'm a filmmaker, suit,
not a fucking weather man.

258
00:14:28,413 --> 00:14:30,333
- I'll let you guys talk.
- No, wait...

259
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,417
So what do you want to do?

260
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:37,650
What I've been doing...

261
00:14:38,188 --> 00:14:39,269
Waiting.

262
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,589
We literally wait two days
for the guy to shoot.

263
00:14:44,702 --> 00:14:45,794
And when he finally does,

264
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:47,888
suddenly he says,
"no one sees any more dailies."

265
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:49,657
Nobody comes in here!

266
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,892
You know, I'm not going to be judged
on my work by fucking novices.

267
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:57,750
We may have snuck a peak.

268
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,878
When billy's right,
he's right.

269
00:15:20,103 --> 00:15:21,184
It looked sick.

270
00:15:27,781 --> 00:15:28,884
Someone just in here?

271
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,392
So is Billy doubting himself?

272
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,967
Nah, Billy never doubts himself.
But something was wrong.

273
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,955
I only have a couple of scenes
in the movie... film.

274
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,265
So I don't understand why the director
wants to eat all his meals with me.

275
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,050
And cut!

276
00:15:56,401 --> 00:15:58,788
That is beautiful.
That is beautiful. Print it!

277
00:15:59,498 --> 00:16:02,537
And everyone else...
Everyone else,

278
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,050
learn from it.

279
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,672
I am so pleased that
you're doing my film.

280
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,586
I see real star quality in you.

281
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:13,827
You're very Sophia Loren,
except not Italian.

282
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,450
You comprende?

283
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,928
Vince, guys, come join us.

284
00:16:18,446 --> 00:16:19,550
You mind?

285
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,050
Why would I mind?

286
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:25,629
Hi there.
How you doing?

287
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:30,050
So, Billy, any word on the new ending?

288
00:16:31,676 --> 00:16:32,712
No.

289
00:16:33,177 --> 00:16:36,428
When a director falls
for an actor on set, all bets are off.

290
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,493
When he doesn't get her,
bet you have a problem.

291
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:40,992
When someone else gets her,
bet the house.

292
00:16:41,388 --> 00:16:43,950
I nailed one of my directors
on <i>Melrose place.</i>

293
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,396
That was the year
they threw me off, actually.

294
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,452
You think that
might've been the reason?

295
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,869
I don't know.
I never really thought about that.

296
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,955
Why are you hovering
around down there?

297
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,305
We got to talk about the ending.

298
00:17:07,328 --> 00:17:08,464
- We do?
- Yeah, we do.

299
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,656
How would you and me talking
about the ending help?

300
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:12,277
Because time is running short.

301
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:14,987
I don't have anything yet, suit,
but stuff is percolating.

302
00:17:15,123 --> 00:17:18,095
I don't have time for percolating.
I need pages to produce. You promised.

303
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:21,862
Is something else wrong?

304
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,834
Does it look like something's wrong?

305
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:27,350
Everyone listen up,
I have something very important to say.

306
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,349
Sex kills.

307
00:17:30,864 --> 00:17:33,206
It kills creativity,
it kills artistry.

308
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,702
It kills a film set.

309
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,948
There will be no sex here...
Not on my film set.

310
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:40,659
I hope that I've made myself clear.

311
00:17:40,975 --> 00:17:43,429
- The ending, Billy.
- Percolating, suit.

312
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,850
Percolating.

313
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,753
I am not having sex with her.

314
00:17:48,826 --> 00:17:50,627
- You sure?
- Pretty sure.

315
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,409
If I don't get a part in this movie

316
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,437
I can have sex with her, technically,

317
00:17:54,561 --> 00:17:55,957
without offending Billy, right?

318
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,103
Yeah, but you may offend
all the Colombians

319
00:17:58,171 --> 00:17:59,702
who would be sickened by the thought.

320
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,877
- Walsh is getting obsessed.
- You think?

321
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,850
I don't care, but he's not writing.

322
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,250
What do you want me to do?

323
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,750
Don't fuck her, for one.

324
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,055
Seriously.
I can still fuck her, right?

325
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,439
Yeah. Drama, if you
can get her, go for it.

326
00:18:13,143 --> 00:18:15,750
Oh, a challenge.
I love it.

327
00:18:17,623 --> 00:18:20,617
You are the most powerfull man in Columbia. (del vo)

328
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:22,913
But I am nothing without love. (del vo)

329
00:18:24,523 --> 00:18:26,099
I'm scared of you. (del vo)

330
00:18:28,395 --> 00:18:30,242
You needn't be. (del vo)

331
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,424
- Cut!
- What's the problem this time, Billy?

332
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,797
It sucked.

333
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,712
15 takes?
I don't get it.

334
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,037
Would you please tell Mr. Chase that
I want some fucking passion out of him?

335
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,224
- You don't want to tell him?
- I'd rather not.

336
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,650
He wants some passion out of you.

337
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,850
- He's not talking to me now?
- I guess not.

338
00:19:01,398 --> 00:19:03,019
Hey. Let's walk.

339
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,707
- What's the problem?
- There's no problem

340
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,250
Billy, I'm not fucking her.

341
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,708
Swear on it, Vince.
Swear on your mother's life.

342
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,273
I just told you I'm not.

343
00:19:15,365 --> 00:19:17,950
- Then who is?
- I have no idea if anyone is.

344
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,664
Vinnie, man, she told me
she wanted to be friends.

345
00:19:23,918 --> 00:19:27,160
Show me the girl who wants to be friend,
I'll show you the guy who's fucking her.

346
00:19:27,205 --> 00:19:28,354
Well, it ain't me.

347
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:30,042
So can we go back to work?

348
00:19:30,893 --> 00:19:32,604
Yeah, Vin,
go back to work.

349
00:19:33,113 --> 00:19:34,350
And will you write the ending?

350
00:19:34,963 --> 00:19:36,179
Yes, I will.

351
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:37,928
He hasn't written shit.

352
00:19:38,266 --> 00:19:40,997
And when we're not shooting
all he does is sit in the bar and sulk.

353
00:19:42,868 --> 00:19:44,851
By thursday, we'll have shot
everything written,

354
00:19:44,896 --> 00:19:47,623
my greatest fear will be realized
and we're gonna have to shut down.

355
00:19:47,691 --> 00:19:50,100
- So, you're starting to panic?
- I'm way past panic.

356
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:54,285
- Get me Stephen Gaghan.
- Stephen Gaghan?

357
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,249
Yeah. You heard of him?
He wrote "Traffic."

358
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,934
- I know who he is.
- He's a good writer.

359
00:19:58,013 --> 00:20:00,174
- It's a two-week job, tops.
- Why can't you write it?

360
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:03,971
Rumors already started
about D.P.'s being fired,

361
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:05,449
production delays, et cetera.

362
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:09,065
But now they want an academy
award winner to do the rewrites?

363
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,849
Ridiculous.
I told him he'd never do it.

364
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:12,050
Yeah, I know stephen...

365
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,950
From the brentwood country mart.

366
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,250
Guy loves me.
He'll do it.

367
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,854
Stephen Gaghan's going to cost us
over 200 grand a week.

368
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,649
- So?
- So we can't afford it.

369
00:20:20,738 --> 00:20:22,697
What we can't afford
is not to have an ending.

370
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,434
Figure it out, suit.

371
00:20:26,695 --> 00:20:28,788
This guy's going to
call me suit one too many times,

372
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,905
I'm gonna knock
his fucking teeth out of his mouth.

373
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:32,749
I called Ari
personally and asked him

374
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,657
if he'd call our financier
and try and get us a little more money.

375
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,744
I told Vince,
"ha ha ha."

376
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,066
our financier
already had enough problems,

377
00:20:40,133 --> 00:20:41,259
you know what I'm saying?

378
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,514
Well, what happened was

379
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,449
I was on my way to
the airport in los angeles

380
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,724
when I was pulled over

381
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,934
and the officer found some cocaine.

382
00:20:49,308 --> 00:20:51,379
Well, it was a lot of cocaine.

383
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,514
Actually.

384
00:20:53,812 --> 00:20:55,049
You're probably asking yourself

385
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:58,477
why on earth was I bringing cocaine
to Colombia.

386
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,773
Well, truthfully, I wasn't.

387
00:21:00,818 --> 00:21:03,849
As it turns out it was an old bag that
had been lying in my trunk for years.

388
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,184
I had just completely
forgotten about it.

389
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,505
In either case, the judge
didn't really buy that.

390
00:21:10,768 --> 00:21:13,750
Meanwhile, my passport has been taken
away while I await trial.

391
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,884
- My bank accounts were frozen.
- Fuck you, man!

392
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,035
And there's no more money just now.

393
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,349
So I can only pray that the 30 mil
I sunk into this thing

394
00:21:23,463 --> 00:21:25,759
isn't going down some
Colombian drain. Right?

395
00:21:25,872 --> 00:21:29,950
'cause there's, you know,
no suicide watch here.

396
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,450
You know what I mean?

397
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,908
Vince, we can't afford Gaghan.

398
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,881
We've got to get a list
of cheaper writers.

399
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:38,254
He'll have to go for it.

400
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,650
Don't use the word cheap.

401
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:43,404
I'm heading to makeup,
see you on set. Hey, be firm.

402
00:21:43,493 --> 00:21:45,350
Have I not been?
Have I not been firm?

403
00:21:46,788 --> 00:21:47,847
What's going on?

404
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,544
He's interrogating the crew to find out
who's been with his girl.

405
00:21:50,646 --> 00:21:52,250
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

406
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,750
I'm going to ask you
one time, chochito.

407
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,739
And if I find out you're lying to me,
I'm not going to be happy.

408
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,182
You understand what I'm saying?

409
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,850
I do, Billy, I do.

410
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:05,050
And I'm not lying.
I swear.

411
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,999
I never touched her.
Never.

412
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,297
Next.

413
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:12,921
What's up, suit?

414
00:22:12,947 --> 00:22:14,681
- We need to talk, now.
- No, I'm busy.

415
00:22:14,762 --> 00:22:17,487
Get your ass up and walk with me
right now, or as god as my witness,

416
00:22:17,532 --> 00:22:20,449
I will send you packing today
and I will finish this movie without you.

417
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,759
Who's going to direct, Turtle?

418
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,550
I directed a couple shorts.

419
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:28,066
What you're making
such a big deal about?

420
00:22:28,111 --> 00:22:29,664
You don't know what?

421
00:22:29,822 --> 00:22:31,285
You convince us we need a new ending,

422
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,973
and while I'm trying
to make that happen,

423
00:22:32,996 --> 00:22:34,864
you're interrogating the crew
about this girl?

424
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,215
I need to know who's fucking her.

425
00:22:36,238 --> 00:22:37,983
- We need an ending.
- And I need Gaghan.

426
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:41,049
You can't have him, but I've got a list
of other writers you can look over.

427
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,032
What, some cheap piece-of-shit hacks?

428
00:22:43,854 --> 00:22:46,449
I know in my heart
that Gaghan is the one guy

429
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,087
who can get us to
where we need to be.

430
00:22:48,132 --> 00:22:49,517
You're supposed to be that guy,

431
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:52,084
we have no more money and no way
of getting any more.

432
00:22:52,129 --> 00:22:54,250
- I'll get rid of the extra army guys.
- Not enough.

433
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,550
And lose the Bogata
central library massacre.

434
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,398
- You love that scene.
- I'm compromising.

435
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:01,150
Since when? You're letting this
girl mess up your mind.

436
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,747
- It's not about the girl.
- Then what's your fucking problem?

437
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:05,849
Living in this jungle
for the past five months.

438
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,241
- What, we haven't?
- You're just moving numbers around.

439
00:23:08,308 --> 00:23:09,772
I'm dealing with sets and extras

440
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,449
and fucking explosions...
Big explosions, man.

441
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,597
My last movie had
12 people in it. 12 total.

442
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,266
Billy, it's going great.
You're killing it.

443
00:23:19,385 --> 00:23:21,495
It's killing me, suit.
I'm melting down.

444
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,850
It's this humidity.
I can't think in this humidity.

445
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,899
- And I need to think.
- You got to finish.

446
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,296
- I can't.
- Yes, you can, all right?

447
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:30,249
And we can't without you,
so snap out of it.

448
00:23:30,386 --> 00:23:32,255
I'm here.
I'll do whatever you need me to do.

449
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,049
You really care, huh, suit?

450
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:37,409
Yeah, I do.

451
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,342
You know, you've never given me
a compliment before.

452
00:23:40,901 --> 00:23:42,094
I never knew you needed one.

453
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,419
I do.

454
00:23:44,698 --> 00:23:46,139
And I need help with the ending.

455
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,619
Please.

456
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,535
It was a nice moment.

457
00:23:51,648 --> 00:23:53,752
Who would have thought
Billy would be so insecure?

458
00:23:53,843 --> 00:23:54,991
So I took care of it.

459
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,769
I personally think
it was about the girl.

460
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,622
But either way,
E got him to step out of it.

461
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,487
I was the guy with her.

462
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,212
I only got a hand job.

463
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,150
But don't tell Billy.

464
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,639
I'm still hoping
to get into the last scene.

465
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:12,050
Drama? No shot.

466
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,709
No shot, but please
bust out a polygraph machine.

467
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,550
So we're all set?

468
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,450
Oh, that's great.
That's great, thank you very much.

469
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,214
Everyone!

470
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:26,033
We got Stephen Gaghan
to rewrite our ending.

471
00:24:26,101 --> 00:24:27,239
Stephen fucking Gaghan.

472
00:24:35,653 --> 00:24:37,476
They got Steve fucking Gaghan?

473
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,650
Stephen Gaghan?
Awesome.

474
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,713
Damn, I'd love to hear
his words coming out of my mouth.

475
00:24:46,014 --> 00:24:48,063
So we fedexed Stephen
a check and a plane ticket.

476
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,405
I was excited.
The guys seemed really passionate.

477
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,150
I couldn't stop thinking about what
I was gonna tell stephen

478
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,650
about what I was thinking.
All night I couldn't sleep.

479
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,902
I started writing some ideas down.

480
00:24:58,466 --> 00:25:00,019
And I wrote and wrote and wrote.

481
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:01,749
I was into it, you know?

482
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,287
On the plane,
my ideas were flowing.

483
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,250
You never know if you're going
to match up with a director.

484
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,292
I woke up this morning
sitting at my typewriter.

485
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,901
I had written all night.

486
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,581
He rewrote the whole fucking script.

487
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,050
- Billy, I love it.

488
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,050
It's perfect.

489
00:25:19,203 --> 00:25:21,350
Hey boys, I'm excited to get into this.

490
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,250
Did we pay this guy yet?

491
00:25:25,683 --> 00:25:27,619
- Billy walsh, our director.
- Steve.

492
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:34,317
$275,000 down the drain.

493
00:25:34,477 --> 00:25:36,098
But I have to admit, the script is good.

494
00:25:36,207 --> 00:25:38,278
- No, it's great.
- It is great.

495
00:25:38,457 --> 00:25:41,449
And Gaghan was kind enough to read it
and agree before he headed back home.

496
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,050
- Thank you so much.
- Hey, no problem.

497
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,050
I've had people read
my work and not like it,

498
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,850
but I've never
had anybody pay me not to work.

499
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,147
It was nice, actually.

500
00:25:50,964 --> 00:25:52,979
FINAL DAY OF PRODUCTION (del vo)

501
00:25:53,227 --> 00:25:54,555
All right, this is our last shot.

502
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,750
Probably the most complicated
of the whole shoot.

503
00:25:56,862 --> 00:25:58,342
And I'm not in it, which is nice.

504
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,782
Which is why we're both
a little toasty right now.

505
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,650
- What?
- You're gonna have to edit that out.

506
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:06,207
So Eric, what's this scene?

507
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,870
Okay, the army storms Pablo's hideout.

508
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:12,787
Explosions go off
in the south, east and west.

509
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,264
We have nine cameras
pointed at everything Billy wants.

510
00:26:15,345 --> 00:26:17,687
We've been prepping
this for three months. It has to work.

511
00:26:17,865 --> 00:26:20,342
- We can't do it twice.
- Okay, are you ready for this?

512
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,089
Are we fucking ready?!

513
00:26:24,772 --> 00:26:26,146
Nobody sounds fucking ready.

514
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,950
Hey, get that fucking camera off me.
I'll throw it in the water.

515
00:26:29,238 --> 00:26:30,274
He's nervous.

516
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,876
Looks like he has it under control.

517
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,297
You freaking?

518
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,641
A little bit.

519
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,250
- It's all good, Billy.
- Everything is prepared.

520
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:43,050
If we get this shot, guys,
we got the whole movie in the can.

521
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,191
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

522
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,591
Let's do it!

523
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,747
Roll cameras!

524
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,250
Set!
We're ready.

525
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:25,798
Let's kill this motherfucker! (del vo)

526
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,750
Cut!

527
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,700
The start was off, suit.
I'm gonna need another one.

528
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,351
I'm fucking with you.
It was perfect!

529
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,717
- Guys, we did it.
- Yes, we did.

530
00:28:08,827 --> 00:28:11,101
Who would have thought
some kids from Queens could have?

531
00:28:11,102 --> 00:28:13,007
But we did,
and it's gonna be fucking amazing.

532
00:28:13,065 --> 00:28:15,950
I've never felt so good about a movie
after it was done than this one.

533
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:17,969
I know it.

534
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:21,850
You think you made a good film?

535
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,750
I'll tell you this:

536
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,745
it's either going to be genius or it's
going to fucking suck.

537
00:28:27,153 --> 00:28:29,050
Until I see the first cut,
I have no idea.

538
00:28:29,203 --> 00:28:32,250
But you know what?
Neither does anybody else.
