15
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,047
JUST EXPLAIN THIS TO ME:
UGLY GUY WALKS INTO A BAR,

16
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,683
AND HOTASS KATHERINE HEIGL
WANTS TO PARTY WITH HIM?

17
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:27,519
- SHE WAS DRUNK!
- SHE WASN'T DRUNK YET,
THAT'S MY POINT.

18
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:29,688
SHE WAS SOBER
AND SHE DRINKS WITH HIM

19
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:32,324
AND THEN SHE GOES HOME WITH HIM
EVEN THOUGH WHEN SHE WAS SOBER

20
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,593
SHE COULD PLAINLY SEE
HOW UGLY HE WAS.

21
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,695
JAMIE WAS SOBER WHEN SHE
MET YOU, WASN'T SHE?

22
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:38,430
I'M CUTE, DRAMA.
ASK ANYBODY.

23
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,866
TURTLE, FUNNY GUYS
GET GIRLS AND SHE WENT
HOME WITH HIM

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,286
- 'CAUSE SETH ROGEN'S FUNNY.
- HE HADN'T SAID ANYTHING YET
TO SHOW HE WAS FUNNY.

25
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,088
HE'S SO UGLY
SHE KNEW HE HAD
TO BE FUNNY.

26
00:01:46,122 --> 00:01:48,857
- HOW WOULD SHE KNOW THAT?
- BECAUSE HE WAS STARRING
IN THE MOVIE.

27
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:52,544
IF HE WASN'T FUNNY,
THERE'S NO WAY SOMEONE THAT UGLY
COULD STAR IN A MOVIE.

28
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,164
YOU KNOW, IN SOME
ALTERNATE UNIVERSE THAT
ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE.

29
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,633
- NOT TO ME IT DOESN'T.
- WHY DO YOU KEEP WATCHING
THIS MOVIE

30
00:01:57,667 --> 00:02:00,602
- IF IT BUGS YOU SO MUCH?
- HIS UGLINESS IS ODDLY
FASCINATING--

31
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:02,538
ESPECIALLY IN BLU-RAY.
IT PISSES ME OFF.

32
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:04,139
IT PISSES YOU OFF?
I'M THE ONE

33
00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:06,508
WHO'S SO GOOD-LOOKING
I COULDN'T EVEN GET
AN AUDITION.

34
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,677
- WHERE DO YOU WANT THIS?
- YOU CAN PUT IT ANYWHERE.

35
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:12,030
- HEY, SLOAN.
- WOW, NICE TO HAVE FRIENDS
WITH FLEXIBLE JOBS, HUH?

36
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,383
- All: HEY.
- HEY, SLOAN, WOULD YOU
BANG SETH ROGEN?

37
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:15,918
- JESUS.
- I THINK HE'S FUNNY

38
00:02:15,952 --> 00:02:17,519
BUT I DON'T THINK I COULD
GO THROUGH WITH IT.

39
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,388
- I TOLD YA!
- WHAT ABOUT TURTLE?

40
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:21,089
<i>- Eric: GUYS!
- YOU THINK HE'S CUTE?

41
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:23,308
- TURTLE, I THINK
YOU'RE VERY CUTE.
- WHAT?!

42
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,911
- THANK YOU, SLOAN.
- YOU'RE WELCOME!

43
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:30,315
ALL RIGHT, TWO SETS OF KEYS,
ALARM CODE AND GARAGE OPENER.

44
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,918
- GREAT.
- AND AMY LEFT THIS FOR YOU.

45
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,003
- A LOVE NOTE?
- FEELS LIKE A PHOTO.

46
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:38,257
- AYUP.
- HOW DO YOU FIND
THESE FRIENDS?

47
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,160
I SWEAR VINCE
BRINGS IT OUT IN PEOPLE.

48
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:44,329
- TELL HER THIS WAS
VERY THOUGHTFUL.
- VERY.

49
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,998
- DO YOU NEED A HAND THERE?
- NOPE.

50
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,267
<i>- ( phone ringing )
- WILL YOU GET THAT?

51
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,636
YEAH.

52
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,223
AHEM.
( sexy voice )
HELLO, ERIC MURPHY'S PHONE.

53
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,659
HELLO?  HELLO?

54
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:59,361
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- THEY HUNG UP.

55
00:02:59,395 --> 00:03:01,012
OH, PROBABLY A WRONG NUMBER.

56
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,315
OR JUST MAYB
ONE OF YOUR RANDOMS.

57
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,868
( laughs )
I GOTTA GO BACK TO WORK.

58
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:07,569
Both:
SEE YOU LATER.

59
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,738
HEY, VINCE, GOOD LUCK
WITH THE PREMIERE TONIGHT.

60
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,506
- THANK YOU.
- NOT THAT YOU NEED IT.

61
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:14,376
- I HEARD THE REVIEWS
HAVE BEEN AMAZING.
- SO FAR SO GOOD.

62
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,445
HEY, SLOAN, YOU WANT
TO COME TONIGHT?

63
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,815
- Turtle: JEEZ,
GIVE LESS NOTICE.
- Drama: SERIOUSLY, E.

64
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:22,367
- WAS I TALKING TO YOU IDIOTS?
- WALK WITH ME.

65
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:24,753
MIND YOUR BUSINESS.

66
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:30,192
- Vince: GUYS!
- Eric: SO WHAT'S UP?
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO?

67
00:03:30,226 --> 00:03:32,327
I JUST DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD BE GOING ON DATES.

68
00:03:32,362 --> 00:03:34,997
DON'T THINK OF IT AS A DATE.
IT'D BE NICE JUST
TO HAVE YOU THERE.

69
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:37,599
- SO WE'LL GO AS FRIENDS?
- YEAH, WE CAN GO AS BUDDIES.

70
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,636
ALL RIGHT,
I JUST BOUGHT A NEW DRESS.
I HAD NOWHERE TO WEAR IT.

71
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,155
( exhales )
I'LL SEE YOU
THERE, BUDDY.

72
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,667
<i>- LLOYD?
- YES, ANDREW?

73
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,703
<i>- ARE YOU OKAY?
- I'VE EATEN NOTHING

74
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,588
BUT ONE GRAPE AN HOUR
FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS.

75
00:03:59,622 --> 00:04:01,607
I WILL BE A STEALTH
AND SLEEK AGENT IN NO TIME.

76
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:04,876
- HOW'S THE WEIGHT LOSS COMING?
- I'VE LOST 16oz.

77
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,246
- HANG IN THERE.
- MR. KLEIN.

78
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,548
- WHAT'S THE GOOD WORD?
- YOU'RE GONNA KILL LLOYD

79
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,967
- AND I HAVE
A PROPOSITION FOR YOU.
- A WIFE SWAP TONIGHT.

80
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,186
- HOW'S THE MISSUS
LOOKING THESE DAYS?
- SHE'S OKAY

81
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,188
BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT
LIZZIE GRANT.

82
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,140
THE JUNIOR AGENT
WITH THE GREAT ASS.

83
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:21,643
- SHE OFFERING IT UP?
- NO, BUT SHE HAS TWO BIG
U.T.A. SHOW RUNNERS

84
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,895
WHO ARE LOOKING
FOR A NEW AGENCY.

85
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,881
ANDREW, YOU'RE TV.
I'M EVERYTHING ELSE.

86
00:04:25,915 --> 00:04:29,534
JUST SIT DOWN SO THEY KNOW THEY
HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE GUY
WITH THE "S" ON HIS CHEST.

87
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,603
<i>- FIVE MINUTES, OKAY?
- DONE.

88
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:34,656
LET'S TALK ABOUT
MORE IMPORTANT THINGS--
ARE YOU PUMPED FOR TONIGHT?

89
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,542
THIS IS NOT
THE NEW "90210" PREMIERE.
THIS IS SCORSESE.

90
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,544
I AM PUMPED INDEED!
OH, A LITTLE HEAD'S UP,

91
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,380
THE WIFE'S PROBABLY
NOT GOING TO COME.

92
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:44,633
WHAT?  WHY NOT?
THIS IS A COUPLE'S THING.
MY WIFE IS VERY EXCITED.

93
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:47,653
- AS WAS I.
- WHAT'S REALLY
GOING ON WITH YOU?

94
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:51,173
- WHAT IF YOUR WIFE
DOESN'T LIKE MARLOW?
- OF COURSE SHE WILL!

95
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,925
NO, MARLOW'S A LITTLE
INTIMIDATED BY THIS SIDE
OF THE HILL.

96
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:56,061
SHE'S STILL
A VALLEY GIRL AT HEART.

97
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,013
ANDREW, MY MAN,
LIGHTEN UP.

98
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,848
MY WIFE WILL
LOVE HER, TRUST ME.

99
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,734
AND WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER
AFTER THIS, WE DON'T HAVE
TO SPEAK TO THEM,

100
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,187
AND WE GET TO KEEP
ALL OUR MONEY.

101
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,321
- OKAY?
- OKAY.

102
00:05:06,356 --> 00:05:08,423
OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TALK TO HER.

103
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,312
- Drama: YOU'RE JUST
DUMB DUMB DUMB.
- WOULD YOU LEAVE ME ALONE?

104
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,747
THE SECOND YOU HEARD
THE "F" WORD COME
OUT OF HER MOUTH

105
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,250
- YOU SHOULD HAVE
TOLD HER TO TAKE A HIKE.
- I WANT HER THERE.

106
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,118
- AS YOUR FRIEND?
- YES.

107
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,187
- BULL-SHIT.
- I'M WITH THESE GUYS.

108
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,956
- WHY ARE YOU
TORTURING YOURSELF?
- I'M NOT TORTURING MYSELF.

109
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,060
I LIKE BEING FRIENDS WITH HER
AND I LIKE BEING SINGLE.

110
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,329
TONIGHT YOU WON'T.
NOT NOW THAT YOU'VE GOT

111
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,197
A NON-FUCKING FRIEND
ON YOUR ARM.

112
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,367
- AT LEAST I'VE GOT
SOMEONE ON MY ARM.
- PLEASE, THE DAY'S STILL YOUNG.

113
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,269
CHASE!
GET ONE SHOT
OVER HERE?

114
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,590
HEY, BOYS,
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

115
00:05:41,624 --> 00:05:43,892
- I WILL GRAB YOUR SUITS.
- THANKS, KELLY.

116
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,328
LOOKING GOOD, KEL,
LOOKING REAL GOOD!

117
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:48,296
- ( E laughs )
- WHAT?

118
00:05:48,331 --> 00:05:51,283
- YOU'RE CREEPY.
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
SHE LOVES ME.

119
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:54,853
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
HER EYES BULGE WHEN THE TAILOR
WAS MEASURING MY INSEAM.

120
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:56,988
- WHY DON'T YOU INVITE HER?
- MAYBE.

121
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,191
HER OR YOUR HAND--
TOUGH DECISION.

122
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,793
THE TOUGH PART IS I LOVE
BEING SOLO AT PREMIERES.

123
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,529
E, DITCH THE BUDDY.
WE'LL SCOUR FOR PUSSY TOGETHER,

124
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,431
BRING 'EM BACK
TO YOUR PLACE.

125
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,533
DRAMA, I MOVED
INTO THIS HOUSE
SO YOU AND I

126
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,169
NEVER HAVE TO BRING
GIRLS BACK TO THE SAME
PLACE AGAIN.

127
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,238
- YOUR LOSS.
- Turtle: WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT

128
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,874
I'D BE
THE ONLY ONE GUARANTEED
TO HAVE SEX TONIGHT?

129
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,243
I MEAN, ALREADY PLANNED
AND WITH A NAME ATTACHED.

130
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:20,912
<i>- I'M TAKING SARA.
- Turtle: OH, FROM SATURDAY?

131
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:22,881
UH, NO, SORRY,
LISA FROM FRIDAY.

132
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:24,549
- SINCE WHEN?
- SINCE JUST NOW.

133
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,186
I GUESS YOU REALLY ARE
THE SEVENTH WHEEL, DRAMA.

134
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,255
NO, FORGET THAT.

135
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:34,292
HEY, KELLY, YOU WANT TO GO
TO MY BABY BROTHER'S
PREMIERE TONIGHT?

136
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,829
- SCORSESE'S "GATSBY."
- UH, YEAH.

137
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,998
<i>- YEAH, OKAY.
- GREAT.

138
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:41,266
<i>- GREAT.
- ALL RIGHT.

139
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,317
ALL RIGHT.

140
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:44,219
SHE LOVES ME.

141
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:46,421
I'D BETTER GET
SOME RUBBERS.

142
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:49,524
SERIOUSLY, ARI, WHY ARE YOU
PUSHING ME TO HAVE A DATE
WITH THIS WOMAN?

143
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:51,493
IT'S NOT A DATE.
IT'S A MANI-PEDI.

144
00:06:51,527 --> 00:06:54,396
I PLANNED A VERY LOVELY
WELCOME-TO-THE-AGENCY
DINNER FOR THEM

145
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,281
WHEN YOU HIRED ANDREW
AND SHE CANCELED.

146
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:59,768
TWICE.
MAYBE MRS. KLEIN DOESN'T
WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH ME.

147
00:06:59,802 --> 00:07:03,388
- ANDREW THINKS THAT SHE'S
INTIMIDATED BY YOU.
- WHY WOULD SHE BE?

148
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,957
BECAUSE SHE'S VERY INSECURE.
AND, HONEY, LOOK AT YOU.

149
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,126
I MEAN, YOU MAKE
CONFIDENT PEOPLE INSECURE.

150
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:12,013
- THAT IS SO SAD.
- I KNOW IT'S SAD, BUT HAVE
PITY ON THE POOR WOMAN.

151
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:14,916
- WHY IS THIS
SO IMPORTANT TO YOU?
- BECAUSE...

152
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:18,269
ANDREW IS ON HIS WAY TO BECOMING
ONE OF MY BIGGEST EARNERS

153
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:21,440
AND I LIKE HIM.
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO HAVE
A NICE COUPLE WE CAN HANG WITH?

154
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,175
WE HANG WITH PLENTY
OF NICE COUPLES.

155
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,744
WE HANG WITH PLENTY OF YOUR
FRIENDS AND THEIR HUSBANDS.

156
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,546
- YOU DON'T LIKE THEM?
- I HATE THEM.

157
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,449
- MAYBE YOU'RE THE PROBLEM, ARI.
- WHY DO I HAVE TO FIGHT
WITH YOU ON THIS?

158
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:35,036
- HAVING A COUPLE I ENJOY WILL
BENEFIT BOTH YOU AND ME.
- REALLY?  HOW SO?

159
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:38,740
IMAGINE I COULD SPEND
THE PROPER AMOUNT OF TIME

160
00:07:38,774 --> 00:07:41,076
WITH YOU IN THE MOST FOCUSED

161
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,378
AND BEST MOOD POSSIBLE
WITHOUT US PRETENDING

162
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:45,580
WE HAVE SO MUCH
TO SAY TO EACH OTHER.

163
00:07:47,183 --> 00:07:49,317
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.
- FINE YOU'LL DO IT?

164
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:51,169
- YOU'LL CALL HER?
- YES, I WILL CALL HER.

165
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:54,406
THAT'S SO GREAT, BABY.
I GOTTA GO BACK TO WORK.

166
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,042
- NEED SOME CASH.
- I AM NOT A HOOKER.

167
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,910
OH, BUT WHAT A GOOD ONE
YOU WOULD BE.

168
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,846
I LOVE YOU.

FUN LUNCH, DARLING.

170
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,520

171
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,655
I'VE BEEN
WITH YOU TOOLS
ALL DAY LONG.

172
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,292
US TOOLS WILL BE OUT OF YOUR WAY
NOW THAT MY WORK HERE IS DONE.

173
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,995
- DID YOU REALLY NEED
TO USE MY BATHROOM?
- I REALLY DID.

174
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,931
- I HAVEN'T EVEN USED IT YET.
- DON'T BE SUCH A PRISS.

175
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,168
- HELLO!
- Turtle: WHOA,
I LIKE YOUR NEIGHBORS.

176
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,220
- HEY, ASHLEY.
- Drama: THAT'S NO NEIGHBOR.

177
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,939

180
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:34,729

YOU CAME ACROSS THAT BRACELET
WHILE YOU WERE UNPACKING?

193
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,046
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LOOKED FOR IT,
I COULDN'T FIND IT.

194
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:09,714
- I'M SORRY.
- DAMN.

195
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,717
WILL YOU GUYS
PLEASE LOOK AT YOUR HOUSE?
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.

196

197
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,857
UM, SO, ERIC, DO YOU

198
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,876
UH, YEAH, IT'S ACTUALLY
VINCE'S BIG PREMIERE TONIGHT.

199
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:24,529
OH, RIGHT RIGHT!
THAT SHOULD BE GREAT.

200
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:26,965

00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,121
GOD, E,
ARE YOU AWKWARD!

211
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,158
- ( laughing )
- I TOTALLY FORGOT
SHE WAS COMING.

212
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:56,728
NEVER IN MY LIFE DID I THINK
I'D EVER SEE YOU KICK A LITTLE
CUTIE OUT THE DOOR LIKE THAT.

213
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,064
- I DIDN'T KICK HER OUT.
- SHE WAS BEGGING FOR A TICKET.

214
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,283
AND A RIDE
ON THE TINY E EXPRESS.

215
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:04,052
- WHY DIDN'T YOU
GIVE HER A TICKET?
- DO WE EVEN HAVE ANY LEFT?

216
00:10:04,086 --> 00:10:06,037
WE GOT PLENTY.
YOU WANT ME TO GRAB HER?
SHE'S CUTE.

217
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,772
- NO, I DON'T WANT HER THERE.
- WHY NOT?

218
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,408
- BECAUSE I DON'T WANT HER
TO GET THE WRONG IDEAS.
- WHAT IDEAS?

219
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,544
- LIKE THAT YOU LOVE SLOAN?
- ( laughter )

220
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:15,513
NO, IDEAS LIKE I DON'T WANT
HER TO BE MY GIRLFRIEND,
WHICH I DON'T!

221
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,816
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT ANYBODY
TO BE MY GIRLFRIEND.

222
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,251
<i>- YOU REALLY LIKE
BEING SINGLE?
- YES!

223
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,088
MR. RELATIONSHIP'S GOING
TO STICK TO THAT STATEMENT?

224
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,224
AW, COME ON.
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE
HE'S ENJOYING PLAYING THE FIELD.

225
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,292
- HE'S ENTITLED.
- HE IS, AND IF HE WERE NORMAL

226
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:30,295
I'D BUY IT,
BUT HE'S NOT,
SO I DON'T.

227
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,431
YEAH, ME EITHER.
SLOAN TELLS HIM SHE WANTS
TO GET BACK TOGETHER

228
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:35,166
ET
AND THE FIELD
IS SHUT DOWN!

229
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,035
SHE WON'T,
SO I GUESS YOU'LL NEVER KNOW.

230
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,771
YEAH, BUT IF SHE DID,
WOULD YOU WANT TO GET
BACK TOGETHER?

231
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,906
SHE JUST WANTS TO BE FRIENDS,
SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

232
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,709
WHY DID SHE PUSH YOU TO GET
YOUR OWN PLACE IF SHE JUST
WANTS TO BE FRIENDS?

233
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:47,696
- BECAUSE SHE'S THOUGHTFUL.
- I THINK SHE'S SENDING
MIXED SIGNALS.

234
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,765
WHICH ISN'T GOOD
FOR A FRAGILE SENSITIVE
MIND LIKE E'S.

235
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,201
YEAH, AND SHE DID TRY AND GET
HIM DRUNK THE OTHER NIGHT.

236
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,553
SO WHAT?
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
NOTHING HAPPENED.

237
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,957
- Turtle:
MAYBE SHE WANTED IT TO.
- SHE'S TESTING YOU, E.

238
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,326
- AND YOU'RE FAILING MISERABLY.
- Others: MM-HMM.

239
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,129
- DON'T YOU GUYS
HAVE TO GET READY?
- TAKES ME TWO MINUTES.

240
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,780
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

241
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:08,083
- LET'S GO.
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE
YOU GUYS LATER.

242
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:10,318
- PEACE.
- LOOK, IF YOU'RE
REALLY DONE WITH THAT,

243
00:11:10,353 --> 00:11:11,836
DO YOU MIND
IF I GOBBLE IT UP?

244
00:11:11,854 --> 00:11:13,338
- ( Turtle groans )
- A) YOU'RE DISGUSTING.

245
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,774
B) YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH
TO BE HER GRANDFATHER.

246
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,510
- Turtle: GREAT GRANDFATHER.
- I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

247
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,564
WAKE UP, TOTO.
YOU'RE NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE.

248
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,333
- JESUS, ARI, YOU STARTLED ME.
- YOU LOOK HALF DEAD.

249
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:28,119
- I'M AT LUNCH.
- STARVING YOURSELF

250
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,538
ISN'T GOING TO HELP YOU
MAKE IT TO THE FINISH LINE.

ANDREW KLEIN'S READY AND HEADING
TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

258

SO WHO WAS THE CHILD
WITH THE BAD ATTITUDE?

I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

448
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,077
SLOAN, LOOK, I DIDN'T WANT
YOU TO COME HERE TONIGHT
AS MY FRIEND.

449
00:21:36,111 --> 00:21:38,629
- I MISS YOU.
- OH, ERIC, DON'T.

450
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,931
I KNOW I SCREWED UP.
I WAS A SHITTY BOYFRIEND.

451
00:21:40,965 --> 00:21:44,301
YOU USED ME AS STORAGE.
I MEAN, YOU MOVED IN
FOR A WEEK

452
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,704
- AND THEN LEFT.
- I KNOW THAT WAS ALL MY FAULT.

453
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:50,841
BUT THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW.
I FINALLY MOVED INTO A PLACE--
A PLACE THAT YOU FOUND FOR ME.

454
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:54,612
ERIC, YOU MOVED IN THIS MORNING.
I CAN'T JUST JUMP BACK IN.

455
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:58,249
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN
BE JUST FRIENDS WITH YOU.

456
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,584
WELL, THEN FOR NOW...

460
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,772
- Andrew: LOOK, I'M SORRY.
- HOW LONG HAS THIS
BEEN GOING ON?

461
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:24,308
I DON'T KNOW,
IT WASN'T THEN IT WAS.
IT JUST HAPPENED.

462
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:25,893
- JESUS.
