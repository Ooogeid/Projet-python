00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,099
Did you know that we've been
on the phone for... 97 minutes?

5
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:13,890
I needed something to pass the time
before <i>The Pussycat Dolls</i> comes on.

6
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,492
You're obsessed,
you know that?

7
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,970
Hey, some people turn
to drugs or alcohol

8
00:01:18,067 --> 00:01:20,864
in times of sadness.
I myself have reality tv.

9
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:22,485
- That's just weird.
- I know.

10
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,553
Why don't you come meet us tonight,

11
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,482
celebrate with us
before we leave for Cannes?

12
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,893
I'm not crashing a night out
with your guy friends.

13
00:01:28,977 --> 00:01:30,824
You wouldn't.
They've been dying to meet you.

14
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:32,175
No, thank you, Eric.

15
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:33,558
Do you really not want to go

16
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,568
or do you just want to see
who gets kicked off?

17
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:38,421
- I can't say.
- All right, compromise:

18
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,587
get the results,
come meet us after.

19
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,128
Okay, fine.

20
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,366
Great. I'll call you
when I know where we're going.

21
00:01:46,004 --> 00:01:47,276
- Bye, Eric.
- All right, bye.

22
00:01:49,363 --> 00:01:50,906
How long have you
been standing there?

23
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:52,571
97 minutes, E.

24
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:56,805
So what's all this chitchat about
between you and your clush anyway?

25
00:01:56,906 --> 00:01:59,058
- My what?
- Your clush... Your client crush.

26
00:01:59,265 --> 00:02:01,428
- I like that.
- Funny how he always warned me

27
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,520
about mixing business with pleasure.

28
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,208
I was trying for pleasure first.

29
00:02:06,191 --> 00:02:07,308
He's admitting to it.

30
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:09,763
No one's hiding anything.
I like her. She's cool.

31
00:02:09,865 --> 00:02:12,492
- So don't hit on her.
- Hey, come on. Who would do that?

32
00:02:13,608 --> 00:02:14,705
Excuse me.

33
00:02:20,978 --> 00:02:22,603
Look at you. How are you doing?

34
00:02:22,745 --> 00:02:23,781
Good to see you.

35
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:26,156
Don't think about kissing me,Turtle.

36
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,496
What's up, Sam?

37
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:29,675
Sammy, the place is looking good, bro.

38
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:31,604
Congrats on Cannes, babe.

39
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:34,531
Why don't you go grab our table
and hang out the rest of the night?

40
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,599
- The drinks on your tab too?
- The way you drink,

41
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,691
it's like giving Turtle here
keys to a whorehouse.

42
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,443
Oh, come on, you cut me deep, man.

43
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,245
Thank you, Sam.
I appreciate it.

44
00:02:43,127 --> 00:02:45,023
- The boys are here.
- What's up, kids?

45
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:46,570
Nobody told me Walsh was coming.

46
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:49,147
I didn't want to hear you complain.
How is it going, Billy?

47
00:02:49,646 --> 00:02:51,975
I'm great, though spending
30 minutes alone with this guy

48
00:02:52,057 --> 00:02:54,554
is sort of painful. You know
he's bringing his wife to Cannes?

49
00:02:54,615 --> 00:02:57,206
No. You're bringing your wife?
it's supposed to be a boys' trip.

50
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,050
When you get married, you realize
that a wife is like a herpes sore...

51
00:03:00,152 --> 00:03:02,000
she comes and goes
when and where she pleases.

52
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,531
Get some Valtrex, 'cause
the rest of us are gonna be yachting

53
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,520
and boozing it up
with bronze-looking broads.

54
00:03:06,764 --> 00:03:09,909
I'm already preparing myself
by working on my foreign speak:

55
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,670
"J'ai dirige ce film.

56
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:14,218
- Voulez-vous avoir le sex?"
- What does that mean?

57
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,352
It means,
"I directed this film. Wanna fuck?"

58
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:22,261
- Hilarious.
- Stop kissing my ass, Drama.

59
00:03:22,454 --> 00:03:23,794
To the bar, come on.

60
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,082
They like each other, huh?

61
00:03:26,732 --> 00:03:28,539
And I heard you really
liked Walsh's script.

62
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:29,995
- So?
- So do you really like it

63
00:03:30,036 --> 00:03:32,696
or are you trying not to get
completely pushed out of the project?

64
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,510
- Fuck off, Ari.
- Did you really like it?

65
00:03:34,611 --> 00:03:35,626
I hated it.

66
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,486
But he already committed to doing it.
I'm just trying to be positive.

67
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:41,592
After five years you finally learned
how to lie. Welcome to hollywood.

68
00:03:41,851 --> 00:03:45,323
- Double suits, get in here.
- All right.

69
00:03:45,463 --> 00:03:48,813
To the time of our lives
we'll all soon be having in Cannes.

70
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:50,635
- Yes, sir.
- Except Ari.

71
00:03:55,138 --> 00:03:56,255
There's Anna.

72
00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:59,057
- You know Anna Faris?
- Yeah, she's E's new client.

73
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:01,944
Nice.
Love Anna Faris.

74
00:04:02,045 --> 00:04:03,081
Introduce me, suit.

75
00:04:06,683 --> 00:04:08,876
What do you want me to say?
He wants her in the movie.

76
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:10,397
- As what?
- My brother.

77
00:04:10,896 --> 00:04:11,951
As your brother?

78
00:04:12,073 --> 00:04:13,884
I was hoping
I'd get a shot at your brother.

79
00:04:13,965 --> 00:04:16,646
No, after meeting Anna he decided
to change the part to my sister.

80
00:04:16,707 --> 00:04:18,745
- That's ridiculous.
- Beyond ridiculous.

81
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:21,161
No, it's not. He wants to add
some lightness to the movie.

82
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,763
- I can be light.
- And I already told him

83
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,730
he's not allowed to hit on her,
so don't worry.

84
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:27,334
- I'm not worried about that.
- Good.

85
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,355
So we'll set a lunch
for the four of us, okay?

86
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,323
Hey, guys,
I think we should cancel the trip.

87
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:34,368
- Why?
- It's the news.

88
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,088
<i>The attorney general did not get</i>

89
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:39,240
<i>into the specific details
concerning the elevation</i>

90
00:04:39,303 --> 00:04:42,247
<i>of the administration's terrorist
attack advisory alert to red...</i>

91
00:04:43,831 --> 00:04:45,617
Tough break, baby.
I guess you're not going.

92
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,381
Well, I gotta go.
Cannes is work for me, so...

93
00:04:48,483 --> 00:04:49,539
Don't start, Ari.

94
00:04:50,022 --> 00:04:53,149
Baby, we are parents now. We have
a responsibility to our children.

95
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:54,977
You know how much
I hate flying together.

96
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:58,532
With this looming threat hanging over us
it would just be irresponsible.

97
00:04:58,642 --> 00:05:00,733
Why don't you just say
that you don't want me to go?

98
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,727
I don't want
our children to be orphaned.

99
00:05:03,463 --> 00:05:05,518
That's very sweet.
And you know what? I won't go.

100
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:07,529
You're actually not gonna go?

101
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,893
No, seriously.
I didn't really want to go anyway.

102
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:12,215
You don't want to go to Cannes?

103
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,028
Do you think I care that much
about the film festival? I don't.

104
00:05:15,155 --> 00:05:17,713
And there are a ton of things
around here that I could be doing.

105
00:05:17,794 --> 00:05:18,891
- Really?
- Really.

106
00:05:19,073 --> 00:05:21,682
- You're not mad?
- No, I'm not. I'm fine.

107
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:25,621
You're the finest woman a man
could ever not have with him.

108
00:05:30,537 --> 00:05:32,528
I think it would
be a mistake for terrorists

109
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,355
to try and take over
any plane that I'm on

110
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:37,656
'cause let's just say
I'm always ready to roll.

111
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,402
Could we stop talking
about this, please?

112
00:05:39,463 --> 00:05:41,331
It's really just that you're
afraid of flying.

113
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:43,867
I don't think the terrorist
alert has anything to do with it.

114
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:45,938
I'm not afraid of flying.
I'm afraid of crashing.

115
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:48,582
I think he's afraid of flying
commercial, is his real problem.

116
00:05:48,663 --> 00:05:50,734
Is it so bad to long
for a private jet?

117
00:05:50,937 --> 00:05:54,057
- No lines, no delays, no shoe bombs...
- No money.

118
00:05:54,138 --> 00:05:56,109
A private jet to Cannes
is 100 gs each way.

119
00:05:56,211 --> 00:05:58,642
How can you put a price tag
on personal safety?

120
00:05:58,723 --> 00:06:00,774
Johnny, just give him
one of your Xanax already.

121
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:03,179
I will not.
nobody traveling with me

122
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,047
takes a tranquilizer
till we've arrived.

123
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,453
- Why?
- In case anything goes down

124
00:06:07,554 --> 00:06:10,255
we need all the manpower alert,
not comfortably numb.

125
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:12,640
Jesus, looks like downtown Baghdad.

126
00:06:12,884 --> 00:06:14,621
That's good... lots of security.

127
00:06:14,763 --> 00:06:16,459
Yeah, no one's
blowing up in Baghdad.

128
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:18,479
- There's Billy.
- Great.

129
00:06:20,142 --> 00:06:21,583
- What's up, Billy?
- Hey.

130
00:06:23,428 --> 00:06:25,011
The plane's been delayed three hours.

131
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:27,732
What? Why?
is there a bomb scare?

132
00:06:27,935 --> 00:06:30,811
No, I'm sure it's just so that they can
check everything more carefully.

133
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,354
No, actually there is a scare.

134
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,181
Turns out it's specific to L.A.X.

135
00:06:34,425 --> 00:06:35,435
Jesus.

136
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:38,014
Can you imagine if we went down
on the way to Cannes, though?

137
00:06:38,074 --> 00:06:40,573
- we'd be remembered forever.
- Yeah, not all of us would be.

138
00:06:40,674 --> 00:06:42,847
Yeah, but the three of us would be.

139
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,803
You know, I used to fear
traveling with you, baby bro.

140
00:06:45,884 --> 00:06:47,671
I thought if we crashed
the press would say,

141
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:49,492
"Vincent Chase and brother perish."

142
00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:52,184
But now with a hit tv show
I'm quite certain they would say,

143
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:53,889
"The Chase brothers perish."

144
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:55,954
Fuck, I'm ready
for whatever happens.

145
00:06:56,055 --> 00:06:57,903
So what should we do
for the next three hours

146
00:06:58,005 --> 00:06:59,751
- besides celebrate your obituary?
- Run.

147
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:01,480
I was thinking
we'd go meet with Anna,

148
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:03,247
talk about getting her in this film.

149
00:07:03,328 --> 00:07:05,338
- I set a lunch for next week.
- So move it up.

150
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:07,984
I want to get her hooked
so I can start rewriting on the trip.

151
00:07:08,398 --> 00:07:09,535
I don't know where she is.

152
00:07:09,657 --> 00:07:12,625
Call her and tell her that Billy Walsh
has got a movie role for her.

153
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:14,351
I'm quite sure she'll come a-running.

154
00:07:14,453 --> 00:07:17,072
Yeah, why put off till tomorrow
what you can accomplish today?

155
00:07:17,194 --> 00:07:18,859
All right,
I'll see where she's at.

156
00:07:19,376 --> 00:07:21,061
- What about us?
- You can come.

157
00:07:21,214 --> 00:07:24,057
- No, me and Turtle ain't going nowhere.
- We're not?

158
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:26,615
No, we're gonna sweep
this entire airport

159
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:28,708
for suspicious and unsavory characters.

160
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,906
Get out of here.

161
00:07:29,987 --> 00:07:32,245
You're getting on that plane
in three hours either way,

162
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:34,980
so would you rather seek out
terrorist scum here on the ground now

163
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,422
or 35,000 feet later?

164
00:07:37,577 --> 00:07:38,616
Fine.

165
00:07:38,861 --> 00:07:40,262
Yo, we're on.
Let's go.

166
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:42,223
Hey, and seek out Ari too.

167
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,314
He's gotta be
around here somewhere.

168
00:07:44,537 --> 00:07:47,664
I confirmed 30 minutes ago
and no one said a word.

169
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:49,528
- Sir, I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

170
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:52,354
Tell that to my work that's not
getting done that could have been

171
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:54,790
getting done if I knew I had
three hours that you're sorry.

172
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:56,861
This has been an extraordinary day.

173
00:07:56,963 --> 00:07:59,105
- We're at code red.
- Please, come on.

174
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,866
We're at code red every time
the president has loose stool.

175
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,363
Sir, may I suggest
you lower your voice

176
00:08:04,506 --> 00:08:06,638
before a national guardsman
mistakes it for a threat

177
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:08,341
and inadvertently shoots you?

178
00:08:10,351 --> 00:08:12,158
My plane's been delayed
for three hours.

179
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,965
And your wife is not going to Cannes.

180
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,778
Oh yeah? So what? How do you know?

181
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,051
- I spoke to her.
- <i>You did? Why? What'd she say?</i>

182
00:08:18,275 --> 00:08:20,494
She's fine with not going, right?
She said she's fine.

183
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,373
"Fine" is not fine, not when
it comes from a woman's mouth.

184
00:08:23,597 --> 00:08:24,977
So no, she's not fine.

185
00:08:25,793 --> 00:08:27,600
And somebody else is also not fine.

186
00:08:28,047 --> 00:08:29,489
- Oh yeah? Who?
- Me.

187
00:08:29,818 --> 00:08:31,036
What's your problem?

188
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:33,615
You said if your wife
didn't go to Cannes, that I could.

189
00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:35,331
When did I say that?

190
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:37,703
When you said it wasn't time for me
to get promoted yet.

191
00:08:37,798 --> 00:08:40,205
You know what?
I'm in the middle of a code-red alert.

192
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,175
We've got military police everywhere,

193
00:08:42,357 --> 00:08:44,607
german shepherds
ready to attack at a moment's notice.

194
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:46,294
I'm facing three-hour delays

195
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:48,269
and an uncertain, unsafe future,

196
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,416
so get off my ass and go get
my wife her favorite flowers.

197
00:08:51,924 --> 00:08:54,092
- Do you even know what those are?
- No, but you do.

198
00:08:54,153 --> 00:08:55,189
Remember that.

199
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:58,397
And remember I know what my favorite
teuscher chocolate truffles are.

200
00:08:58,498 --> 00:09:00,021
Send yourself a box, Lloyd.

201
00:09:00,305 --> 00:09:02,740
Okay, but this discussion
is not over yet, Ari.

202
00:09:03,004 --> 00:09:04,162
Yeah, it is.

203
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:06,941
I need this role to be self-aware,

204
00:09:07,022 --> 00:09:11,043
but with a subconscious lack of
understanding. You understand?

205
00:09:12,231 --> 00:09:14,221
Not totally.
Is that bad?

206
00:09:14,323 --> 00:09:15,785
When you read it, you'll understand.

207
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:18,157
Exactly. I express myself
better when I write.

208
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:21,913
The important thing is that
I've seen <i>Scary Movie</i> 10 times

209
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:23,764
and I know you can bring it for me.

210
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:25,442
- Really?
- Really.

211
00:09:26,144 --> 00:09:27,362
Is he being serious?

212
00:09:27,646 --> 00:09:29,596
Because I can't tell
if he's making fun of me.

213
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:33,156
- What's wrong with <i><i>Scary Movie</i></i>"?
- I love Scary Movie.

214
00:09:34,086 --> 00:09:35,934
it just doesn't seem
like it'd be your thing.

215
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,334
What do you think my thing would be?

216
00:09:38,963 --> 00:09:40,608
<i>Blue Velvet</i> maybe,

217
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,553
<i>Henry portrait of a serial killer</i>.

218
00:09:43,938 --> 00:09:45,522
I've seen them both 20 times also.

219
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:48,171
I'm a cinephile
and I see everything.

220
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,979
I've seen <i>Lost in Translation</i>
and loved it.

221
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,929
And I've seen <i>Just Friends</i>...
I loved it too.

222
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,233
I see a contrast in you and me

223
00:09:54,842 --> 00:09:58,626
that I think would work
perfectly for this film.

224
00:09:58,992 --> 00:10:02,188
And I would be honored
if you just gave it a read.

225
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:14,596
There's a good-looking group, huh?

226
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:16,391
And I do feel safe with nuns.

227
00:10:17,143 --> 00:10:19,031
- Not me.
- Oh, come on.

228
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:20,889
God wouldn't take down
a plane full of nuns.

229
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:22,432
I gotta believe in at least that much.

230
00:10:22,513 --> 00:10:24,665
I believe it too,
but what if they're not nuns?

231
00:10:25,477 --> 00:10:26,786
What else would they be?

232
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:29,243
What, you don't think
it's odd that a group of nuns

233
00:10:29,283 --> 00:10:30,745
is traveling to the south of France?

234
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:32,833
Since when can't nuns vacation?

235
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,127
They can, but just not
to places like Cannes

236
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:37,117
in the biggest party
season of the year

237
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:39,211
where girls roam the streets topless.

238
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:41,103
Maybe it's a missionary trip

239
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:43,487
and they're there
to convince the girls to cover up.

240
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:44,694
Maybe.

241
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:46,471
- Oh, Jesus.
- What?

242
00:10:46,575 --> 00:10:49,113
I'm fine with the nuns.
It's this guy that scares me.

243
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,144
No profiling, Turtle.
I don't believe it.

244
00:10:51,286 --> 00:10:53,522
Have you seen <i>24</i>?
'Cause I have.

245
00:10:56,173 --> 00:10:58,305
- All right, let's make a move.
- What kind of move?

246
00:10:58,873 --> 00:11:00,274
The same kind of move I made

247
00:11:00,315 --> 00:11:02,487
when I was terrified
of Pete Minetto in high school...

248
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:03,972
we befriend him,
make him love us.

249
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:06,687
That way when he seizes the plane
and starts executing people

250
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:08,616
he let's us go free.

251
00:11:08,737 --> 00:11:10,174
I don't want to befriend him.

252
00:11:11,514 --> 00:11:13,402
Then I'm gonna feel
no guilt if I survive.

253
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:19,376
Are these seats taken, my friend?

254
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:21,305
Great.

255
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:25,305
I'm Johnny.
This is Turtle.

256
00:11:25,764 --> 00:11:26,962
Oh, and this is Ari.

257
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:31,885
Ari's fucked.

258
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,916
I'm an actor.
What do you do?

259
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:37,336
I'm fine.
I don't know what you're talking about.

260
00:11:37,418 --> 00:11:39,671
If you're fine, why are
you out shopping for cars?

261
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:41,729
What does one thing
have to do with the other?

262
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,348
I want a new car. What, I can't
have a new car if I want one?

263
00:11:44,428 --> 00:11:46,377
- It's my money also.
- You can have a new car.

264
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:48,305
I'm saying you might want to go home

265
00:11:48,346 --> 00:11:50,803
because there are probably
beautiful flowers waiting for you.

266
00:11:50,864 --> 00:11:52,963
Why?
Are you feeling guilty about something?

267
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:56,878
I'm not feeling guilty, baby. You're
happy. You're fine with not going.

268
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,339
And you're happy I'm not going.

269
00:11:59,415 --> 00:12:00,694
How much are the Mybachs?

270
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:01,995
I'll call you back, Ari.

271
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:04,411
<i>Please check the board for rescheduling.</i>

272
00:12:05,463 --> 00:12:06,539
FLIGHT CANCELED

273
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,306
You gotta be shitting me.

274
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,279
- Baby...
- This is not your baby.

275
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:15,127
This is your
underappreciated assistant.

276
00:12:15,391 --> 00:12:17,645
- What do you want, Lloyd?
- I spoke to my therapist

277
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,853
and he said I should not
hide what I'm feeling.

278
00:12:19,975 --> 00:12:23,142
I should express to you my hurt
and disappointment about not going.

279
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:24,772
Well, now that you've
expressed that,

280
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,676
let me express my frustration
that my flight has been canceled.

281
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:31,226
Maybe this is karma.
Perhaps you should do something

282
00:12:31,307 --> 00:12:33,236
to turn it before something
really bad happens.

283
00:12:33,358 --> 00:12:34,987
Today, Lloyd?
Under code red?

284
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:36,875
I'm sorry, Ari.
That was wrong.

285
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:38,361
Yeah, it was.
Now listen,

286
00:12:38,503 --> 00:12:41,163
call my boy Kenny Dichter
over at Marquis Jets,

287
00:12:41,305 --> 00:12:43,518
see if me and the boys
can hop on a flight today.

288
00:12:43,701 --> 00:12:45,609
- You're gonna fly private?
- Just do it.

289
00:12:46,442 --> 00:12:50,076
Maybe in France we'll hit the
restaurant of your choice, on us.

290
00:12:50,238 --> 00:12:52,490
The flight's canceled.
Let's get the hell out of here.

291
00:12:52,653 --> 00:12:54,663
Really?
That's awesome.

292
00:12:56,226 --> 00:12:57,756
How do I get in touch with you?

293
00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:00,425
You don't.
If it's meant to be

294
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:02,699
we'll run into each other.
Be well, my friend.

295
00:13:03,665 --> 00:13:05,635
That girl is wife material...

296
00:13:05,736 --> 00:13:08,125
wife, mother,
grow-old-together material.

297
00:13:08,227 --> 00:13:09,425
Too bad you have a girlfriend.

298
00:13:09,426 --> 00:13:11,374
Yeah. You did promise
you wouldn't hit on her.

299
00:13:11,577 --> 00:13:13,866
I'm talking in terms
of presence for the film.

300
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,957
The sister has to have that thing

301
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,512
that you just adore at all
times in order for her to be able

302
00:13:18,573 --> 00:13:21,090
to get away with some of
the more vicious things that she does.

303
00:13:21,172 --> 00:13:23,297
Speaking of which,
you could have come to my defense

304
00:13:23,358 --> 00:13:25,378
just a little when she was
quizzing me back there.

305
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:26,434
- Your defense?
- Yeah,

306
00:13:26,475 --> 00:13:27,899
she asked me pretty tough questions,

307
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,950
you're just sitting there
like you got no tongue.

308
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:32,467
You were talking the whole time.
What did you want me to say?

309
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:34,621
She looked at you a couple
of times for reassurance

310
00:13:34,641 --> 00:13:37,281
- and you didn't give her much.
- 'Cause it's an awkward position.

311
00:13:37,362 --> 00:13:39,291
I'm her manager but I'm
also a producer on this.

312
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,353
It's a no-show-type job title anyway.

313
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:43,573
I don't want to jam it down her throat.

314
00:13:43,593 --> 00:13:45,766
Plus, it doesn't really matter.
She's got the script,

315
00:13:45,827 --> 00:13:47,735
she loved Billy,
so what do you want me to say?

316
00:13:47,817 --> 00:13:49,191
You think she loved me, suit?

317
00:13:50,572 --> 00:13:53,106
- Hey, what's up, Turtle?
- <i>Yo, E, our flight's canceled.</i>

318
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:55,281
- What?
- The whole airport's shut down.

319
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,412
All right,
we'll meet you back at the house.

320
00:13:58,042 --> 00:14:00,386
L.A.X. is closed.
There's no flights leaving today.

321
00:14:01,035 --> 00:14:02,091
- Jesus.
- What?

322
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:04,897
I couldn't bear
going without you, baby.

323
00:14:04,998 --> 00:14:07,475
I know they closed the airport.
It's all over the news,

324
00:14:07,577 --> 00:14:09,831
so stop making it
like it's some grand gesture.

325
00:14:09,912 --> 00:14:12,881
Baby, what did we learn about
being passive-aggressive in therapy?

326
00:14:13,064 --> 00:14:16,209
If you wanted to go you should
have not said "I don't want to go."

327
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:18,488
I'm tired of feeling
like I'm not wanted.

328
00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:21,129
Baby, what are you talking about?
This is a one-time thing.

329
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:23,098
You came home last night
and you said

330
00:14:23,138 --> 00:14:25,352
that the hotel had screwed us
out of a king-sized bed

331
00:14:25,392 --> 00:14:27,363
and would I
"really be comfortable in a single?"

332
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:29,241
<i>and then this morning
before the news came on</i>

333
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:31,068
<i>you said that Brian Sher's wife
wasn't going</i>

334
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:33,516
and if she found out
that I was going, she would go crazy.

335
00:14:33,618 --> 00:14:36,614
There are some men that would kill to go
to the south of France with me

336
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:37,974
<i>and if you're not one of them...</i>

337
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:40,917
I am one of them, honey.
I'm glad that the flight was canceled,

338
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:43,252
so now I can tell you I want you to go.

339
00:14:43,637 --> 00:14:45,320
<i>I don't want to go without you</i>

340
00:14:45,563 --> 00:14:48,203
and I love you.
Now will you go?

341
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:49,596
No, Ari, I won't.

342
00:14:49,954 --> 00:14:50,969
Why not?

343
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:53,426
Well, because all that will
do is assuage your guilt.

344
00:14:54,391 --> 00:14:55,607
Why would you want to do that?

345
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,548
- Well, you shouldn't feel guilty.
- What should I feel?

346
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:00,274
Sadness that for some reason

347
00:15:00,355 --> 00:15:02,580
you're married to someone
you don't like to be with.

348
00:15:02,742 --> 00:15:05,640
Laura, I'll definitely
need some help upstairs.

349
00:15:06,748 --> 00:15:07,824
Hello, Lloyd.

350
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,442
- Hello, Ari.
- You're not my mistress.

351
00:15:10,544 --> 00:15:12,336
 Stop being mad at me.
- I'm no longer mad.

352
00:15:12,437 --> 00:15:14,711
You shouldn't be,
'cause I'd love to have you in Cannes.

353
00:15:14,752 --> 00:15:17,522
So go home, pack your favorite sarong
and consider yourself invited.

354
00:15:17,603 --> 00:15:19,442
- Are you serious?
- I'm so serious

355
00:15:19,624 --> 00:15:21,350
that I'm actually
embarrassed for myself.

356
00:15:21,431 --> 00:15:23,095
- That's very sweet of you.
- It's not,

357
00:15:23,136 --> 00:15:25,856
'cause I don't want to see you when
I'm there. This is a man's trip,

358
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:27,934
so you're gonna have to
find your own dick clique.

359
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:29,760
That is fine, Ari.
Oh my god.

360
00:15:30,187 --> 00:15:33,192
I'm so happy.
But how are we getting there?

361
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:35,825
- You called Kenny D., right?
- He says there are no jets.

362
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:38,952
The whole town is scrambling since
the alert and you scrambled too late.

363
00:15:39,074 --> 00:15:41,533
- There's not one more plane?
- There was one,

364
00:15:41,634 --> 00:15:43,205
but Sydney Pollack just booked it.

365
00:15:43,469 --> 00:15:44,606
Fuck!

366
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:46,677
The airline said
that they can't guarantee

367
00:15:46,758 --> 00:15:48,947
that we can get on a flight tomorrow?
This is unreal.

368
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:51,952
My travel lady says
we could drive to Phoenix,

369
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:54,810
get on a flight to st. Louis and
then hop on a flight to France.

370
00:15:55,744 --> 00:15:57,491
- Sounds miserable.
- Beyond miserable.

371
00:15:57,612 --> 00:15:59,960
This is insane.
<i>Medellin</i> premieres in 48 hours.

372
00:16:00,062 --> 00:16:01,658
- We may not make it.
- We'll make it.

373
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:03,486
Ari will take care of it, I'm sure.

374
00:16:04,217 --> 00:16:05,417
Hey, what's up, Anna?

375
00:16:05,518 --> 00:16:07,903
I thought you'd be on a plane.
I was gonna leave a message.

376
00:16:07,985 --> 00:16:09,873
No, everything got canceled.
Turn on the news.

377
00:16:09,974 --> 00:16:11,802
Oh, I'm sorry.
That sucks.

378
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:13,142
What's going on?

379
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:14,868
It's about Billy's script.

380
00:16:17,335 --> 00:16:18,452
Can I speak freely?

381
00:16:18,554 --> 00:16:20,036
Of course.
What's going on?

382
00:16:20,909 --> 00:16:22,168
I don't get it.

383
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,483
It's Sydney Pollack returning.
My fingers are all crossed.

384
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,633
Is this my dear old friend Sydney?

385
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,222
I told you when I fired you
we weren't friends.

386
00:16:33,343 --> 00:16:36,466
You consider that a firing?
I like to look back at it

387
00:16:36,527 --> 00:16:38,639
as an amicable parting of the ways.

388
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,365
I'm not coming back, okay?
You understand the word "never"?

389
00:16:41,548 --> 00:16:43,071
Well, you just keep thinking about it

390
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:45,431
because this is not a business
call, this is personal.

391
00:16:45,695 --> 00:16:46,888
I need a lift to Cannes.

392
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:49,162
<i>I heard you got the last plane
out of marquis</i>

393
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:52,776
and I've got to get Vinnie Chase and
the <i>Medellin</i> crew there by tomorrow.

394
00:16:53,101 --> 00:16:55,665
<i>Medellin</i>... You know,
I hear a lot of hype about that film.

395
00:16:55,787 --> 00:16:57,574
It's phenomenal.
It's absolutely phenomenal.

396
00:16:57,693 --> 00:17:00,353
I'm not completely sold
on that kid of yours yet.

397
00:17:00,536 --> 00:17:03,860
After a plane ride and a screening
you'll see him as the next Redford.

398
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:06,175
You want to do a
<i>Three Days of the Condor</i> sequel?

399
00:17:06,296 --> 00:17:07,413
No.

400
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:09,484
I wouldn't mind reading him, though.

401
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:12,098
You know, maybe something
would come up.

402
00:17:13,377 --> 00:17:15,367
<i>Okay, Ari, I'll give you a lift,</i>

403
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,314
as long as I don't sit next to you.

404
00:17:17,378 --> 00:17:18,647
I'll ride in the bathroom.

405
00:17:19,195 --> 00:17:21,276
- <i>How many you got?</i>
- Six.

406
00:17:21,536 --> 00:17:25,232
I can't take six. I can do maybe five,
and that's gonna be tight.

407
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:28,297
We'll make do. Listen,
I still love you, Sydney.

408
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,008
6:30 sharp at Van Nuys.
Goodbye, Ari.

409
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:35,346
Come on.
It was a numbers thing.

410
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:37,194
You heard...
I couldn't have done anything.

411
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:38,899
- Where are you doing?
- To unpack.

412
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:41,364
Unpack?
You couldn't have even packed yet.

413
00:17:41,831 --> 00:17:44,978
In my mind, I did, Ari.
Iin my mind, I did.

414
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,984
It's not my fault she doesn't get it.

415
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:49,218
But it is your fault
if you don't try and help her to.

416
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,095
- What do you want me to say?
- I want you to say that you're gonna go

417
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:53,831
convince her
that she should do the movie,

418
00:17:53,912 --> 00:17:57,115
because that's what your director wants,
and as a producer, that is your job.

419
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:58,403
It's your job, E.

420
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:00,415
How would you like me
to try to convince her?

421
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:02,465
Tell her how great
you think it's gonna be.

422
00:18:02,543 --> 00:18:03,721
That's what she wants to hear.

423
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,512
What if I don't think
it's gonna be great?

424
00:18:05,593 --> 00:18:08,008
Should I lie to her?
'Cause that's not what a manager does.

425
00:18:08,211 --> 00:18:09,389
You lied to me.

426
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,694
What, you don't think I know
you don't like it?

427
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:14,668
I don't know,
you've never asked for my opinion

428
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,185
- before you agreed to do the movie.
- Because you hate Billy.

429
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:19,921
I knew there was no way you
were gonna read it with an open mind.

430
00:18:19,962 --> 00:18:21,241
What, you're a mind-reader now?

431
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:23,123
You asked me if I thought it was okay

432
00:18:23,163 --> 00:18:25,721
if you sign Anna as a client
and I said one thing:

433
00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:27,997
"just make sure
it doesn't affect my career."

434
00:18:28,321 --> 00:18:29,580
This is the movie I'm making

435
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:31,371
and this is who
I want to be in the movie.

436
00:18:31,412 --> 00:18:33,341
And I really believe
it's gonna be a great movie

437
00:18:33,381 --> 00:18:34,599
and she's gonna be great in it.

438
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,756
You have to believe that
and try to make this happen.

439
00:18:36,796 --> 00:18:37,859
And if I can't?

440
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:39,728
At least
make me believe that you tried.

441
00:18:40,221 --> 00:18:43,023
Hey, Ari called. He said we have
to be at the airport in three hours.

442
00:18:43,145 --> 00:18:44,162
How are we getting there?

443
00:18:44,182 --> 00:18:46,122
Sydney Pollack's
giving us a lift on his G-IV.

444
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:49,432
Sweet.

445
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:51,074
I told you it was gonna work out.

446
00:18:51,703 --> 00:18:52,921
It always does, right?

447
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:55,452
- So do you really like the script?
- You really hate it?

448
00:18:55,838 --> 00:18:58,376
No, I don't hate it.
I'm unsure.

449
00:18:58,782 --> 00:19:00,215
You know, it's confusing.

450
00:19:00,662 --> 00:19:02,469
I'm really looking
for some guidance here.

451
00:19:02,821 --> 00:19:04,953
Yeah, well, maybe you
should give it another read.

452
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,282
"Leopold furiously cooks breakfast.

453
00:19:09,546 --> 00:19:12,145
Curtis enters and Leopold,
overcome by his presence,

454
00:19:12,327 --> 00:19:14,522
sears his hand
over the hot sizzling bacon.

455
00:19:14,827 --> 00:19:16,207
Curtis begins to weep."

456
00:19:17,446 --> 00:19:19,439
- It's written in haiku.
- The guy's an original.

457
00:19:20,315 --> 00:19:22,406
I'm a little surprised
we're off on this.

458
00:19:22,772 --> 00:19:24,567
Maybe it's just
my head space right now.

459
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,618
But if you think I should do it...

460
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,037
do you think I should do it?
I really trust your opinion.

461
00:19:30,276 --> 00:19:31,981
I think Billy's gonna
make a great movie.

462
00:19:32,042 --> 00:19:34,039
So you were happy
with what he did on <i>Medellin</i>?

463
00:19:35,318 --> 00:19:36,617
It got into Cannes.

464
00:19:39,107 --> 00:19:40,671
Okay, I'll do it.

465
00:19:43,422 --> 00:19:45,513
I'm sure Billy and Vince
will be happy to hear that.

466
00:19:45,595 --> 00:19:47,017
So do you have to go to the airport?

467
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:48,662
Yeah, the flight leaves at 6:30.

468
00:19:48,905 --> 00:19:51,261
Oh, you've got some time.
Do you want a drink?

469
00:19:51,498 --> 00:19:52,879
Sounds good.

470
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,945
Well, I think I'm excited.

471
00:19:58,433 --> 00:20:01,214
You know,
I'm excited to start a new movie

472
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,186
and to be free
from my loser boyfriend.

473
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,507
You don't sound completely convinced.

474
00:20:07,055 --> 00:20:08,369
When you break up it's tough.

475
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:10,692
It's weird.
I was with Dave for so long

476
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,507
that I've completely shut off
any possibility of somebody else.

477
00:20:14,538 --> 00:20:17,279
Fortunately, you're not gonna have
to do much. Once people find out

478
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:19,095
you're single,
they're gonna be lining up.

479
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,562
I'm gonna tell you something
embarrassing, but that'll cheer you up.

480
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:25,910
When we first met,
I thought you were cute.

481
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,593
And I thought
our first dinner was a date.

482
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:31,623
Oh my god, are you serious?

483
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:34,384
Oh, I'm such an asshole.

484
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:35,718
No no.

485
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,568
So you don't hate me for it?

486
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,862
- No, I'm happy to be working with you.
- Me too.

487
00:20:40,218 --> 00:20:42,224
And I'm glad you've become
a good friend.

488
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:44,927
And I thought you were cute too

489
00:20:45,228 --> 00:20:46,496
when I crashed into you.

490
00:20:49,864 --> 00:20:51,234
What?

491
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:54,842
What?

492
00:20:55,997 --> 00:20:57,601
I don't really like Billy's script.

493
00:20:59,996 --> 00:21:01,254
I don't understand.

494
00:21:06,603 --> 00:21:08,085
Welcome to Marquis Jet, gentlemen.

495
00:21:08,491 --> 00:21:10,197
And a very warm welcome it is.

496
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:13,125
Will you ladies be joining us
on our trip to France?

497
00:21:13,256 --> 00:21:15,139
No, but you'll be in their good hands.

498
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,162
Hi, Vince.

499
00:21:17,703 --> 00:21:19,262
The friendly skies at last.

500
00:21:21,804 --> 00:21:23,411
Somebody grab my fucking luggage.

501
00:21:24,162 --> 00:21:25,543
You got a lot of bags, Billy?

502
00:21:26,128 --> 00:21:29,093
I like a lot of wardrobe choices
too when traveling abroad.

503
00:21:29,272 --> 00:21:31,115
I got one bag, Drama, you fruit cup,

504
00:21:31,216 --> 00:21:33,470
but I took three ambiens
and I can't lift my arms.

505
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,102
- Hey, what's up?
- Fruit cup.

506
00:21:36,285 --> 00:21:38,280
There they are,
boys of <i>Medellin</i>.

507
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,940
I want you all to say hello
to Mr. Sydney Pollack.

508
00:21:41,042 --> 00:21:42,626
Hey, Sydney.
Big fan.

509
00:21:42,785 --> 00:21:44,787
Me too, Vince.
Pleasure to have you guys.

510
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:46,475
Pleasure to be had, Sydney.

511
00:21:47,063 --> 00:21:50,292
In fact, I've been dying to meet you
ever since I played the Redford role

512
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:52,022
in <i>The Way We Were
</i>off-Broadway.

513
00:21:52,306 --> 00:21:54,975
- You played that part?
- Yeah. You don't see it?

514
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:57,057
Are we ready to go?

515
00:21:57,138 --> 00:21:58,762
Actually, we're waiting for one more.

516
00:21:59,311 --> 00:22:01,077
Wait a minute.
Five... We said five.

517
00:22:01,983 --> 00:22:04,440
I miscalculated, but it is no problem.

518
00:22:04,561 --> 00:22:06,953
We'll take the late little man
and put him in the overhead.

519
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,045
Every passenger
has to have their own seat, sir.

520
00:22:09,091 --> 00:22:10,188
That F.A.A. regulations.

521
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,314
Rules. Come on,

522
00:22:12,472 --> 00:22:13,973
I got my eight people to take care of.

523
00:22:14,034 --> 00:22:16,146
You guys work it out
and we'll see you on the plane.

524
00:22:16,186 --> 00:22:18,176
- I'm sorry about that, Vince.
- Hey, no problem.

525
00:22:21,617 --> 00:22:23,018
What the hell, Ari?

526
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:24,602
No one said an agent could count.

527
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:27,359
I screwed up, okay?
But I can remedy this situation.

528
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:30,379
Everyone that does not have
a purpose in Cannes, say "aye."

529
00:22:30,501 --> 00:22:32,186
Turtle, Drama, don't hold back.

530
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:33,688
Hey, I have a purpose there...

531
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,133
to raise the awareness
of Johnny Chase...

532
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:38,283
a purpose that also
translates to cash

533
00:22:38,341 --> 00:22:40,001
in the miller-gold pockets,
I might add.

534
00:22:40,123 --> 00:22:42,861
Look, guys, Drama's right.
He has more of a purpose there than me.

535
00:22:43,287 --> 00:22:44,912
I'll stay back.
It's cool. Don't worry.

536
00:22:45,348 --> 00:22:46,636
Oh, great. Now I feel terrible.

537
00:22:46,697 --> 00:22:48,687
- It's fine.
- Nobody's hanging back

538
00:22:48,995 --> 00:22:50,721
or everybody's hanging back, okay?

539
00:22:50,924 --> 00:22:53,063
What are you talking about?
You bled for this thing.

540
00:22:53,124 --> 00:22:55,428
- You've gotta go. It's your movie.
- We all bled for it.

541
00:22:55,465 --> 00:22:58,125
We'll get another plane tomorrow,
'cause tonight it's all or none.

542
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,738
- There may not be a plane tomorrow.
- Billy, why don't you go?

543
00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:03,633
Eh, fuck it.
I'm a team player.

544
00:23:03,866 --> 00:23:06,285
Look, I will bail.
I gotta salvage a marriage anyway.

545
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:09,180
- Don't worry about it.
- No, "All or none of us" includes you.

546
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:11,514
Excuse me, ladies, would
you mind telling Mr. Pollack

547
00:23:11,575 --> 00:23:13,342
that we're gonna have to
catch another ride?

548
00:23:13,398 --> 00:23:15,672
Hey, Vin, should we call E,
tell him not even to bother?

549
00:23:15,751 --> 00:23:17,761
Unless my triple vision's
getting the best of me,

550
00:23:17,848 --> 00:23:19,127
that looks like him right there.

551
00:23:19,194 --> 00:23:21,103
- Sorry I'm late, guys.
- You're not.

552
00:23:21,738 --> 00:23:24,073
We sacrificed the plane
to the god of friendship.

553
00:23:24,174 --> 00:23:26,144
- What?
- If it's meant to be, we'll get there.

554
00:23:26,526 --> 00:23:28,171
- How'd the meeting go?
- Not great.

555
00:23:28,516 --> 00:23:30,526
- So she's not gonna do it?
- She's not doing it.

556
00:23:30,628 --> 00:23:33,476
Good. I was thinking I wanted
to keep it as the brother anyway.

557
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:36,806
Ari, since you didn't want
to sail the open seas with me,

558
00:23:36,861 --> 00:23:39,401
I'm taking Tom on a Rosie cruise
to Puerto Vallarta for a week.

559
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:41,403
- Sounds good.
- We are on our way

560
00:23:41,448 --> 00:23:43,153
and I'm not even asking permission.

561
00:23:43,313 --> 00:23:46,014
All right. Listen, have a
great time, wear a life vest,

562
00:23:46,095 --> 00:23:48,637
'cause the only bobbing you
should be doing is on tom's cock.

563
00:23:48,881 --> 00:23:49,916
Thanks, Ari.

564
00:23:51,182 --> 00:23:52,278
So what now, Ari?

565
00:23:53,486 --> 00:23:55,417
- Kanye, what's up, man?
- How are you doing?

566
00:23:55,508 --> 00:23:57,124
- How are you doing?
- I've been good.

567
00:23:57,388 --> 00:23:58,841
How does Turtle know Kanye?

568
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:01,493
Kanye, Ari gold. How are you?

569
00:24:01,554 --> 00:24:03,585
I called your manager
about you and I sitting down

570
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,818
for a little meet-and-greet.
you know my boy Vinnie?

571
00:24:05,928 --> 00:24:07,162
Yeah, I know Vince.

572
00:24:07,385 --> 00:24:09,070
What's up, Kanye?
How have you been?

573
00:24:09,172 --> 00:24:11,327
- Good. Where are you headed?
- Nowhere.

574
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,443
We got no plane, man.
Where are you guys heading?

575
00:24:13,484 --> 00:24:15,880
We're going to London.
We're just chilling out for a second.

576
00:24:15,941 --> 00:24:17,118
How much room you got?

577
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,775
We got a little room.

578
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,265
You feel like
making a quick stop in Cannes?

579
00:24:23,894 --> 00:24:25,161
Not really.
I mean...

580
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:27,863
- You'd be really helping us out.
- Yeah, I mean, like...

581
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:30,130
- Who do we know in Cannes?
- Everybody.

582
00:24:30,953 --> 00:24:32,262
Everybody's over there.

583
00:24:32,524 --> 00:24:34,806
- It would really mean a lot to us.
- Come on, Kanye.

584
00:24:34,957 --> 00:24:36,739
Well, I guess we're going to Cannes.

585
00:24:37,834 --> 00:24:39,418
Kanye to the rescue.

586
00:24:45,974 --> 00:24:48,045
Vinnie, go ahead. I'm just
gonna make a quick call.

587
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:49,912
- To your wife?
- Yes. Leave no man behind.

588
00:24:50,137 --> 00:24:52,025
Put in a good word to Kanye for me.

589
00:24:55,378 --> 00:24:57,510
<i>Baby, listen, it's not that
I didn't want you to go.</i>

590
00:24:57,591 --> 00:24:59,459
I love you by my side always.

591
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,984
It's just that I wanted to be
one of the boys for once

592
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,529
<i>with Vinnie and everyone.
I just...</i>

593
00:25:03,785 --> 00:25:06,039
I wanted to feel
young again, you know?

594
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:07,757
But now I know that I don't

595
00:25:07,858 --> 00:25:10,031
and I want to feel my age with you.

596
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:13,414
That's sort of a sweet sentiment.

597
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:16,196
<i>I want you to get down here.
Come on down, honey.</i>

598
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:19,391
Go on your boys' trip.
I understand.

599
00:25:19,819 --> 00:25:21,463
If you'd been honest
from the beginning,

600
00:25:21,494 --> 00:25:22,600
<i>we would have been all good.</i>

601
00:25:22,682 --> 00:25:23,839
- Really?
- <i>Really</i>.

602
00:25:25,131 --> 00:25:26,350
But I do want you to come.

603
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:29,117
I know,
and that's enough for me.

604
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,504
- You're amazing.
- Thank you, Ari.

605
00:25:32,347 --> 00:25:34,439
Oh, and thank you
for all the lavish gifts.

606
00:25:34,668 --> 00:25:35,927
It was very thoughtful.

607
00:25:36,271 --> 00:25:37,367
You deserve it.

608
00:25:38,023 --> 00:25:39,302
How thoughtful was I?

609
00:25:40,235 --> 00:25:42,326
- Have a safe flight, Ari.
- <i>I love you.</i>

610
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:48,108
- So she fired you?
- Yep.

611
00:25:48,392 --> 00:25:50,321
- Will she maybe still date you?
- Nope.

612
00:25:50,642 --> 00:25:52,185
- Tough break.
- Sorry, E.

613
00:25:52,591 --> 00:25:53,992
She'll maybe still date me.

614
00:25:54,876 --> 00:25:56,013
Bringing your wife, Ari?

615
00:25:56,561 --> 00:25:58,246
No, and I'm actually sad.

616
00:25:58,571 --> 00:26:00,459
Yo, what up, everybody?
It's Kanye

617
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:02,929
and we're getting ready
to take off in just a few minutes.

618
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,408
And for those of you who don't know,

619
00:26:04,469 --> 00:26:06,255
I actually took
flying lessons a week ago,

620
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:08,184
and even though it's totally illegal,

621
00:26:08,326 --> 00:26:09,774
I'm gonna fly us out of here.

622
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,241
Nah, I'm just fucking with you.

623
00:26:14,438 --> 00:26:17,260
I'm just fucking with you.
We've got some real old-school pilot,

624
00:26:17,463 --> 00:26:19,604
used to fly Air Force One,
extremely old.

625
00:26:19,686 --> 00:26:22,000
Actually, it might be his last flight.
He's gonna retire.

626
00:26:22,064 --> 00:26:24,523
And just for the heads up,
when you see the flight attendants

627
00:26:24,564 --> 00:26:26,290
coming down the aisle,
Mandy and Sandy,

628
00:26:26,493 --> 00:26:28,897
feel free to get a massage,
'cause it's crazy.

629
00:26:29,405 --> 00:26:30,603
It's crazy.

630
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:33,410
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

631
00:26:33,686 --> 00:26:36,082
I'm Hot Stone.
She's Shiatsu.

632
00:26:36,437 --> 00:26:38,894
- Can I freshen up your drink for you?
- Yes, you can.

633
00:26:39,591 --> 00:26:40,687
Still sad, Ari?

634
00:26:41,581 --> 00:26:43,428
but I will get over it.

635
00:26:43,774 --> 00:26:44,931
Cheers to that.

636
00:26:45,374 --> 00:26:46,470
Cheers.
