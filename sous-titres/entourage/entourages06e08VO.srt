1
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:18,202
<i>Entourage</i>

2
00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:23,114
Eric Murphy's office.

3
00:01:23,132 --> 00:01:25,250
Hey, could you hold on one second?

4
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:30,422
<i>I'd love to sit down with you,
tell you what I'm doing over here.</i>

5
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:33,458
- I've got Sloan McQuewick.
- Maybe we could find some business to do together.

6
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:35,293
<i>- Sure.
- Want to call back?</i>

7
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:36,478
<i>- That'd be great.
- You got it.</i>

8
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,463
<i>- All right, take care.
- Bye.</i>

9
00:01:39,983 --> 00:01:42,067
- Yeah, put her through.
- You never called her back.

10
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,518
I know.

11
00:01:48,658 --> 00:01:51,660
- Hey.
- Are you seriously not calling me back?

12
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,996
And don't tell me you've
been too busy with work

13
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,682
Because I left you a message
before you even started the job.

14
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,183
What, you didn't get it?

15
00:01:58,217 --> 00:02:00,836
Oh, I got your message. And
so did my sort-of girlfriend.

16
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,704
Oh, sorry.

17
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,791
Sorry that I've sort of have a girlfriend
or sorry that she got the message?

18
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,909
I didn't know you sort of had a girlfriend.

19
00:02:07,944 --> 00:02:10,929
I don't anymore, so I guess you didn't
need to know that in the first place.

20
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,931
Look, Eric, I'm
sorry. I just--

21
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,599
No, I know. It's not your fault.

22
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,269
I was gonna call you back too.
Things just-- they've been crazy.

23
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,305
- Why, what happened?
- We think vince has a stalker.

24
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,691
God, really? What are you gonna do?

25
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,560
- Ari's got us meeting with some security experts.
- Ari on your cell.

26
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:28,714
<i>- That's good.
- Uh, yeah, I have to go meet vince now.</i>

27
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,315
So I've kinda gotta take off.

28
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:32,401
Okay.  Um...

29
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,802
I'll let you go then.

30
00:02:33,836 --> 00:02:36,121
- Okay.
- Okay.

31
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:40,993
Eric, I was calling you because I wanted
to make sure you weren't mad at me.

32
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,328
<i>- Sloan, I'm not mad at you.
- Okay, good.</i>

33
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:45,731
<i>- We'll talk soon.
- Okay, I'll talk to you later.</i>

34
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,749
- Bye.
- Bye.

35
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,803
- Yo.
- Keep me on hold longer.

36
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,056
<i>Sorry, I actually have to work nowadays.</i>

37
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,425
I'm glad you finally admit the
last five years of your life

38
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,593
- Were all a fanta pro.
- What's up?

39
00:02:58,644 --> 00:03:01,212
- Aren't I seeing you in a few minutes?
- I'm not going to make it.

40
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,898
I just wanted to assure yoas I,

41
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,050
<i>Aaron cohn knows what's what. Trust him,</i>

42
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,652
Listen to him, this is serious business.

43
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,988
<i>- No, I understand.
- Call me right after.</i>

44
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,107
- I will. -
I gotta-- go.

45
00:03:14,177 --> 00:03:17,162
What the hell's going
on? Huh?  What the--

46
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:19,431
Don't worry, mr. Gold, he's not dead.

47
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:21,700
- I felt for a pulse.
- Everyone get out of here!

48
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:24,669
Or I'm going to be checking
all of you for a pulse

49
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,005
And not finding one!

50
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,924
How long has he been like this?

51
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,043
He hasn't moved in the
20 minutes I've been here.

52
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,427
Jesus christ. Barbara here?

53
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,546
It's before noon, ari. She's not here yet.

54
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,314
I mean "mr. Gold." it's before noon!

55
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,467
- Vanish!
- Yes, sir.

56
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:43,372
Wake up!

57
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:45,557
What time is it?

58
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:48,276
It's time for you to wake up and tell
me why you think this is a holiday inn.

59
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,978
God.

60
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:52,364
I didn't sleep last night
at all. I'm in a daze.

61
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:56,051
I'm sorry I'm in your
office, but my couch sucks.

62
00:03:56,085 --> 00:03:57,936
- Are you on drugs?
- Drugs?!

63
00:03:57,954 --> 00:03:59,988
- Coke, dust,
smack-- - ari, no!

64
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,790
No, I took a sleeping pill.

65
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,993
- Or maybe two.
- Why didn't youor  take it?

66
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,079
I don't have a home anymore, officially.

67
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,614
- Why, what did you do now?
- It wasn't me, it was my wife.

68
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:12,167
- I spoke to her. She forgave you.
- No!

69
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,886
She can't forgive me-- she won't.
She told me I can't live there.

70
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:19,891
- You can't live here!
- This all happened late last night.

71
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,594
- A hotel would go to have been better! I thought
- I don't have any money.Gh

72
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:24,262
I told you, she controls all of it.

73
00:04:24,296 --> 00:04:26,798
She turned off all of my
credit. I had my company cards,

74
00:04:26,816 --> 00:04:29,067
But I thought I didn't want to
use it for personal expenses.

75
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,687
- Good thinking.
- And I set my berry alarm for 5:30.

76
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:36,358
- I didn't expect to sleep-- - how
are you going to handle sorkin today?

77
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,310
<i>The same way that I have been handling him.</i>

78
00:04:39,328 --> 00:04:42,063
I'm fine, ari. Aaron sorkin will be

79
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:44,315
Signed, sealed and delivered

80
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,851
To this agency today,

81
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:48,587
If I have to finance every
future project of his myself.

82
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,790
- With what money?
- I'm prepared for this. I just need to wake up.

83
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:54,459
And change.

84
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:56,845
Yes! And change.

85
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,224
Who just walked through my
lobby in a robe and pajamas?

86
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,110
- Andrew klein.
- Where the fuck is ari?

87
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:15,447
Is this guy mossad or what?

88
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,715
Aren't all israelis?

89
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,650
I'll bet he's observing us right now.

90
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:21,103
He's gonna come in and
grade us on our vigilance.

91
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,655
What do you think turtle's
face in a bong'll earn us?

92
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,574
An "a" for calmness under pressure.

93
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:28,226
I'm not gonna have to walk around
with a giant dude from now on, am I?

94
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,462
Ari says we gotta listen to
this guy, so whatever it takes.

95
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,415
He's all about following orders nowadays.

96
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,734
- Hardy-har-har. -
Well, it worked for him.

97
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,452
He listened to his long-lost love

98
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,738
And now he's got a sweet
house and a swanky job.

99
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,140
- Yeah, but he lost ashley.
- Oooh, I miss ashley.

100
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,710
- She was spunky.
- He should call her.

101
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,578
- Ashley or sloan?
- Either.

102
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,297
You guys don't think it's weird that you have

103
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,682
- Conversations about me right in front of me?
- I don't.

104
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,467
Sloan called today. I
was actually kind of rude.

105
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,852
- Oh yeah?  Why?
- I don't know.

106
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:56,605
I got it.

107
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,395
- Hey.
- I'm aaron cohn.

108
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:04,980
Eric murphy. Come on in.

109
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,532
Hey, vince, how are you doing?

110
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,768
I'm great considering
I'm surrounded by people

111
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,037
Who are making me more
and more paranoid each day.

112
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,272
Nobody should make you paranoid.

113
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,910
- Now who are they?
- I'm turtle.

114
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,462
- I'm safe.
- I'll be the judge of that.

115
00:06:20,496 --> 00:06:22,547
- Hi.  Aaron.
- I'm aware,

116
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,700
As I'm sure you're aware I'm johnny chase.

117
00:06:24,734 --> 00:06:27,869
So you use no alarm system at all?

118
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:31,006
Just our trusty attack dog.

119
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,894
Well, we'd better reinforce the windows.

120
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:38,997
- With what?
- Steel frame around the edges,

121
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:41,099
Bulletproof glass.

122
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:43,268
I don't want anything coming through these.

123
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:46,488
<i>- Nothing gets in, nothing gets out.
- What if there's a fire?</i>

124
00:06:46,522 --> 00:06:48,974
Get a hose. Vince, here's
what we're gonna do.

125
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,076
We're gonna turn this
house into fort knox--

126
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,112
Armored windows, hi-res
cameras and around-the-clock

127
00:06:54,146 --> 00:06:57,866
Vip otection from the finest
trained predators on god's planet.

128
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,036
- Is all this really necessary?
- Is it really necessary

129
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,955
To waste my time with stupid questions?

130
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,790
That's not nice. Is that nice?

131
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:08,293
I'm talking a real
multilayered security system.

132
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:12,664
We have a specific threat. We have an
individual who's already crossed the line.

133
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,000
You'll have three to five men
stationed here in the house

134
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,002
And two will follow you wherever you go.

135
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,138
- How much is this gonna cost?
- I take a $100,000 retainer

136
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:23,775
And then I'll put together the budget
for getting your full system put in place.

137
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,027
- Jesus.
- Wow.

138
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:27,646
There's 600 grand sitting in your driveway.

139
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,132
Tell me what's worth more--
your cars or your head?

140
00:07:32,735 --> 00:07:34,286
- I'm not gonna fire him!
- Then I will.

141
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,772
On what grounds? That he
wore his pajamas to work?

142
00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:38,940
On the grounds that he is
a distraction and a mess.

143
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:42,828
He's having some domestic disturbances.
Christ, how many have you had?

144
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,847
- Show some sympathy.
- I have zero for him,

145
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,300
- And zero for you.
- I don't need any.

146
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,302
Oh yes, you do.

147
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:53,505
Because your failed experiment
from the valley is a complete bust.

148
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,424
Everybody knows it and look at you!

149
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,426
You're still hanging on for dear life!

150
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,712
Listen, has the collagen seeped
into your brainstem, babs?

151
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,281
He is not a bust. He is killing it for us.

152
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,268
He is just about to sign aaron sorkin.

153
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,236
I've been hearing that for two months now.

154
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:10,789
- Well, today is the day he's coming in.
- Bullshit.

155
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,290
He's on the books. Go check.

156
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,610
He's making us a laughingstock, ari!

157
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,730
People all over town are hearing
all about these little instances.

158
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,733
Go tell them today is pajama
Wednesday; we're industry leaders.

159
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,303
If he doesn't sign aaron sorkin today,

160
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:29,007
You're firing
him-- or I am.

161
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,797
Lloyd!

162
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,385
- Yes, sir, mr. Gold.
- Get andrew klein in here right now.

163
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,974
<i>Go!</i>

164
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:02,491
Let's run it again. I nee.

165
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,249
How was that? Did I seem
like I was in real jeopardy?

166
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:13,201
I thought you were a little over the top.

167
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:15,253
Maybe you should play vince next time.

168
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:17,889
Drama, you're flesh and blood--
it makes it more realistic.

169
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,291
- Well, not really.
- Reset!  Drama.

170
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,028
- I think I'm gonna sit this one out.
- Pussy.

171
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,313
I need a visiting girlfriend this time.

172
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:27,649
Turtle.

173
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:31,636
- Oh, come on, vin!
- I'd really hate to be unprepared.

174
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,655
Let's go, bitch.

175
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:36,191
- Yo, turtle, let me get that camera.
- Yo, e, no.

176
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,528
I've got the room wired. You can
watch it downstairs on the monitors.

177
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,446
- Come on, let's go.
- Enjoy!

178
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:46,585
- Turtle?
- Yeah, drama?

179
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,487
Tell me a story.

180
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:50,488
I know I should be worried,

181
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,674
But this is not a bad way to start out a day.

182
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,509
- No.
- How's your day?

183
00:09:54,544 --> 00:09:56,094
- It's okay.
- Just okay?

184
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,463
- Come on, are you all right?
- Yeah, totally.

185
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,182
- Sloan in your head?
- No!

186
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:02,050
E, you're very easy to read.

187
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,636
<i>- Go! - You're right-- sloan's
in my head, so is ashley.</i>

188
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,072
It's not a bad head.

189
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,674
- Oh, shit.
- Jesus.

190
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,343
I don't know, I was kind of
rude to sloan this morning.

191
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,613
So call her back. She's
been calling you for days.

192
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,431
She obviously wants to talk.

193
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:18,400
Yeah.

194
00:10:18,434 --> 00:10:21,119
Yeah, you're right.

195
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,488
I'm gonna call her.

196
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,375
<i>Hello?</i>

197
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,894
- Hey.
- Eric?

198
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,745
<i>- Yeah.
- Hey.</i>

199
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,165
<i>- Hey.
- What's up?</i>

200
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:37,369
- Just calling to say hi.
- Oh.  Hi.

201
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,304
I'm sorry if I was a little rude earlier.

202
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,840
No... No.

203
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,476
<i>- I shouldn't have been.
- Well, probably not.</i>

204
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,294
<i>- Why were you?
- I don't know.</i>

205
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:48,346
And I never said thank you
for helping me get the job.

206
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,215
I'm loving the place so far, so thank you.

207
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,267
<i>- You're welcome.
- Thanks.</i>

208
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:57,355
Um, do you want to grab a drink later
and you can tell me all about the new job?

209
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:59,891
<i>- A drink?
- Yeah, a friendly drink.</i>

210
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:03,195
- I thought you didn't want to be friends anymore?
- Eric, that was weeks ago.

211
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,280
- We can have a drink.
- Are you seeing anyone?

212
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,532
<i>- I said a friendly drink.
- I heard you.</i>

213
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:10,619
I was just curious if you were seeing
anyone. I told you I was seeing someone.

214
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,704
I am seeing someone.

215
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,075
<i>- So you have a boyfriend.
- We haven't put a label on it.</i>

216
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,377
- Who is he?
- Look, let's just meet for a drink

217
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:21,263
And we can catch up on everything, okay?

218
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:23,581
<i>- Yeah, sure.
- How's 7:00</i>

219
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,167
At the bazaar at the s.L.S. Hotel?

220
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:28,270
<i>- Sounds good.
- Okay, perfect.</i>

221
00:11:28,304 --> 00:11:29,971
I'll see you then. Bye.

222
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,927
Why the hell is andrew
klein still not in my office?

223
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,147
- His office is trying to locate him.
- What the hell does that mean?

224
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,899
He's got sorkin!

225
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:49,708
Andrew klein's office.

226
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,410
- Where the hell is he?
- Ari, ari!  He's gone missing.

227
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:54,379
He's got sorkin in 13 minutes.

228
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,881
- I know, we were supposed to have a premeeting.
- Did you call him?

229
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,284
- Of course.  There's no answer.
- Did you call his house?

230
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:02,237
- No, ari, I didn't call his house!
- Don't get snide with me.

231
00:12:02,271 --> 00:12:04,089
You're the reason why you can't try his house

232
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:07,125
And you're the reason no one seems
to know where he is. But I do know

233
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,262
That we've got aaron sorkin coming
in and he'd better be signed today

234
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,846
- For your sake.
- Got it.

235
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,182
- Lloyd!
- Yes, sir, mr. Gold.

236
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,269
Call andrew klein from my
cell so my number comes up.

237
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,638
Unless he's dead, he'll pick up.

238
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,489
Everything okay, ari?

239
00:12:21,524 --> 00:12:23,191
Why wouldn't it be?

240
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,663
Come on, marlo! Just open the damned door.

241
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:30,982
<i>Go fuck yourself!</i>

242
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,917
Who's that? Your little whore calling?

243
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,288
- No, it's ari.
- Tell him to go fuck himself too.

244
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:39,257
- Hey, ari.
- Where are you?

245
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,543
- I'm at my house.
- Why, when you have

246
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,461
A meeting with aaron sorkin in 10 minutes?

247
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,331
I'm trying to get my notes for the
meeting but marlo won't give them to me!

248
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,500
You should have tattooed them
on your little whore's ass!

249
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,185
- You let me in, marlo!
- Fuck you.

250
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:53,888
<i>- Whatever's in this house is now mine.
- Andrew!</i>

251
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:56,975
- Come back to the office.
- Not without my notes, ari.

252
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,727
I can't do this meeting without them.

253
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,062
That's because you are a loser.

254
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,315
You're not smart, you're not funny

255
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,733
And you can't fuck for shit.

256
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,901
Do you hear this, ari? She's unreasonable.

257
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,020
<i>Andrew, hear this, focus on it:</i>

258
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,574
This is the most important
meeting of your entire life.

259
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,493
I have stuck my neck out for
you over and over and over,

260
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:17,362
But if this does not go well,

261
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,696
You are done here.

262
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,232
- What, you're gonna fire me?!
- Barbara is.

263
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,551
That's great. That's just
great. You hear that, marlo?

264
00:13:23,586 --> 00:13:25,470
- Ari's gonna fire me.
- And why should I care?

265
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,589
<i>Because even if we don't get back together,</i>

266
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,141
- You need me to make money!
- Get back together?!

267
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:33,378
I'd fuck hamas before I would fuck you again.

268
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,897
And you need to make money, my friend,

269
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:38,216
Because I'm gonna take all you have!

270
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,985
You open the goddamned door, marlo!

271
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,271
Andrew, you need to get in your car

272
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,090
And drive back here right now.

273
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,776
Not without my notes, ari. I
have worked on them for a month.

274
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,527
It is the key to me signing sorkin.

275
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:52,947
You don't need your notes. You
need to walk over to your car,

276
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,400
<i>Get in and drive here right now.</i>

277
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:59,671
If you do that, I promise you will be okay.

278
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,711
Okay, fine.

279
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,682
She is such a bitch, ari.

280
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,417
<i>She asked me to come back and I did.</i>

281
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,602
- I know.
- I did everything I could.

282
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:17,305
<i>- You're gonna be okay.
- She's a goddamned bitch.</i>

283
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,610
You want your notes, motherfucker?

284
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:25,313
Here they are!

285
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,199
Don't you dare burn my sorkin notes.

286
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,620
- Andr-- - what do you think
of that, you piece of shit?

287
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:34,739
She's burning my sorkin notes.

288
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:45,817
What the fuck?

289
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,852
- Jesus!
- Andrew!

290
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,063
Andrew? Andrew!

291
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,817
- Andrew!
- Aaron sorkin's here.

292
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,222
- Put him in the conference room.
- Andrew's not here yet.

293
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:09,274
- I'll be in in five.
- Sorkin hates your guts.

294
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:13,278
And I hate yours, but right now
we're all gonna have to findwa .

295
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,298
She has a boyfriend.

296
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,250
She said they don't have a label on it.

297
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,319
Let's just hope he puts a rubber on it.

298
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,204
- Jesus!
- Sorry, e.

299
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,606
You're right. The truth is

300
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,058
The thought of her with
somebody else is making me sick.

301
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,877
E, you haven't been with her for two years.

302
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,146
- What did you think?
- A) I try not to think about it,

303
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,965
And b) since I took this
job and this house for her--

304
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,967
Aha! He admits it.

305
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,936
I haven't been hiding
it. --Since I did,

306
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,104
I didn't think she'd go and
get a possible boyfriend.

307
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,556
You had a possible girlfriend.

308
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,641
I know, and I liked her and I'm
not with her because of sloan.

309
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:46,728
Sloan is all-powerful. She
stops him from getting pussy

310
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,814
- And she won't give him any. - I
know-- I should be pissed, right?

311
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,316
- I'd be.
- I am!

312
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,535
- What does she want from me?
- You'll have to ask her.

313
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:57,205
Vince, any chance this could be
an ex you had a bad breakup with?

314
00:15:57,239 --> 00:16:00,792
- Uh, I don't think so.
- We just found all these photos.

315
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:03,761
If it's not a random psycho,
it could be someone you know.

316
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,763
- That's not her.
- She's with him.

317
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,199
- Really?
- No, not really.

318
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,468
I obviously left them here when I moved out.

319
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,421
- She have an axe to grind?
- No, but he does.

320
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,889
Heh!

321
00:16:14,924 --> 00:16:16,591
There he is.

322
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,776
Oh, come on. Where's anew klein?

323
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,479
- He's feeling a little under the weather.
- So he sent you?

324
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:22,713
- Yes!
- But I hate you.

325
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:23,998
Aaron, come on. It's been years.

326
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:25,884
I'm not over it. Is andrew coming or not?

327
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,203
I am confident that we can
do everything for you here.

328
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,005
- Everything-- better than anyone
else in town. - Hello, aaron.

329
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,641
- This is a waste of my time.
- How are you?

330
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:36,177
Great, but I think you know I'm not
a big fan of yours either, barbara.

331
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:40,532
I think you'll find that whatever un
- happiness you had in the past we can change.

332
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,868
- And now make you happy.
- Look, I like andrew klein.

333
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:47,121
I've been talking to him for a couple of
months.  He said he had the keys to my kingdom.

334
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,240
He was going to bring me
ideas. I was going to hear them.

335
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,175
I'm confident I can relay
those ideas to you right now.

336
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,211
- Mr. Gold!
- I'm in the middle of a meeting.

337
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,246
<i>- Are you kidding me?
- The meeting's over.</i>

338
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,549
- I'm just flirting with her.
- This is an emergency.

339
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,901
- Andrew klein is on the phone.
- Oh good, where is he?

340
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,286
Uh...

341
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,738
You can speak.

342
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,190
He's in jail.

343
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,770
Thanks, man, I appreciate that.

344
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,706
Hello?

345
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,108
<i>- Hello!
- It's ashley.</i>

346
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,144
Hey-yy! How are you?

347
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,379
<i>- I'm okay, I'm fine.
- Are you sure?</i>

348
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:30,848
No.

349
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,151
Uh, I mean,

350
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,086
I'm sorry.

351
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,754
Why? Look, I was the asshole.

352
00:17:36,788 --> 00:17:37,989
<i>Yes, you were,</i>

353
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,790
But I asked for it.

354
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,843
I wanted you to tell me
the truth and you did.

355
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,063
<i>- I should respect that.
- Well, I appreciate it.</i>

356
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,365
And... I miss you.

357
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,136
<i>Hello? Is that weird to say?</i>

358
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,971
Uh, no, not at all.

359
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,940
I'm just a little surprised, that's all.

360
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,659
I'm a freak,
I know, but--

361
00:17:57,693 --> 00:18:01,029
I've been thinking and I can
understand why you're not over your ex.

362
00:18:01,063 --> 00:18:04,282
<i>- But if you tell me you're not
together-- - we're not together.</i>

363
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,367
We haven't been together for a long time.

364
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,771
I was just scared that I was
some naive chick getting used.

365
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:11,506
No, you weren't being used. I liked you.

366
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,008
<i>- Still?
- Yeah, of course I still do.</i>

367
00:18:14,043 --> 00:18:15,093
Good. Come over.

368
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:17,345
<i>- Uh, right now?
- Yeah, I want to see you.</i>

369
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:19,097
<i>- Uhhh...
- It's okay if you can't.</i>

370
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,332
<i>- I understand.
- Can I call you back in a bit?</i>

371
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,102
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay, thanks.

372
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,137
- Hey!
- Hello.

373
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,722
Is everything okay?

374
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,975
- Yeah yeah.
- All right, buddy.

375
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,394
Let's go get that drink.

376
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,180
You know what, sloan?

377
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,866
I don't feel like drinking.

378
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:41,536
What do you feel like doing?

379
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,039
- I think I should go.
- Where?

380
00:18:45,074 --> 00:18:48,042
Hey, buddy, will you
hold that car up, please?

381
00:18:48,077 --> 00:18:49,994
You know, this was a bad idea.

382
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,546
I gotta go. I'm sorry.

383
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,030
E, what the fuck?!

384
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,166
Well, what's the point to this?

385
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,001
<i>- The point to what?
- This!</i>

386
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,537
First you want to be friends,
then you don't want to be friends,

387
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,889
Now you want friendly cocktails.
You don't know what you want

388
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:04,425
And I don't want to fuck it up
with a girl that I kinda like.

389
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,911
- I'm sorry about that, man. Sorry.
- E!

390
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:10,181
E! I am doing the best I can.

391
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:13,685
<i>I do miss you, but I just need time.</i>

392
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,688
You've had plenty of time, all right?
And in that time, I've found someone else.

393
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,424
I don't want to mess it up while you're
trying to figure out what you want.

394
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,326
Is it that girl? The young
one from the premiere?

395
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,079
- She's 24.
- Yeah.

396
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:26,531
So that's it?

397
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,666
Yeah, I guess it is.

398
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:54,692
Aaron, you didn't really
need to come down here.

399
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:57,261
I tell you, andrew, I was
so eager to hear your ideas,

400
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,780
I would have gone anywhere.

401
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:00,948
Go ahead, andrew, give them to him.

402
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:02,700
Give them to him.

403
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:10,842
Uh...

404
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,778
Look, aaron, you write,

405
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:18,116
You produce, um, in tv and in film.

406
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,701
But I...

407
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:24,856
I think it's time to...

408
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,959
To conquer that
last frontier--

409
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,393
Directing.

410
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:33,064
I don't want to direct. I'm a writer.

411
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:36,067
I like writing. I could have
directed years ago if I wanted to--

412
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,669
He-- he-- he has more
actually. You have more,

413
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:41,839
Right, andrew?

414
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:45,243
Uh...

415
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,612
Act as if you have faith

416
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,580
And faith shall be given to you.

417
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:53,034
- Jesus, that's pathetic.
- No, he's quoting me.

418
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,670
It's "the west wing,"
the assassination episode.

419
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:57,588
I had a lot more of your quotes written down

420
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:01,392
And I had a lot of amazing
ideas, brilliant ideas,

421
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,261
But I couldn't get into my house.

422
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:06,330
My wife wouldn't let me get
them. I blew that chance.

423
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:10,168
I blew my marriage, and
if I blow this with you,

424
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,637
I've blown my career too.

425
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:13,938
I'm sorry, aaron.

426
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,824
I drove into my own house for you, aaron,

427
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,359
My own...

428
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:21,963
Under-insured overpriced
beverly hills motherfucking home.

429
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:25,066
I took my car and I put it in gear

430
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,953
And I drove right into my
own goddamn living room.

431
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,810
For you. Who else would do that?

432
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:48,973
- I'm sorry.
- I had a rough divorce too.

433
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,592
I get it.

434
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,046
We'll give it a shot.

435
00:21:56,715 --> 00:22:00,234
- Really?
- Yeah, but if he ever calls me, I'm gone.

436
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,718
- Oh, don't you dare.
- What?  I have to get it.

437
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,469
- Why?
- Because it could be vince.

438
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,689
Vince is a big boy. Come
on, I need my eric fix.

439
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:42,259
Listen, vince has a stalker and
something might have happened.

440
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,528
- Seriously?
- Yes.

441
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,448
Yo, everything cool?

442
00:22:47,482 --> 00:22:49,533
Mmm, yeah, totally.

443
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,836
You still with sloan? We're
going a little stir-crazy.

444
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,071
We're gonna take big yoni out for some fun.

445
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,741
<i>- I'm at ashley's.
- Ashley's-- how?</i>

446
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,542
She's great. We're great.

447
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,745
Uh-huh, okay, have fun.

448
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,748
I will. You are gonna get me in trouble.

449
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,116
- Where was he?
- Ashley's.

450
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,085
- At sloan's.
- Ashley's.

451
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,922
- Interesting.
- Vince, you know

452
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,456
A Curtis Tucker?

453
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,642
- Nope.
- Well, he knows you.

454
00:23:14,676 --> 00:23:17,461
- Found this in the couch.
- What does that mean?

455
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,715
It means that we may have found our stalker.
