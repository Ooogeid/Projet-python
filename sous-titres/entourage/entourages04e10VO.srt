4
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,821
I'm asking if you think
I should work with this girl.

5
00:01:09,957 --> 00:01:12,496
I'm asking if you can work with her
without trying to bang her.

6
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,131
- She has a boyfriend!
- I don't think you could work with her

7
00:01:15,282 --> 00:01:17,648
- without trying to bang her.
- I never seem to be able to.

8
00:01:17,802 --> 00:01:20,323
But the girl you work with
wanna bang you, doesn't she?

9
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:22,964
- Wait still that she does he.
- She has a boyfriend!

10
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,704
So? It's not a husband!

11
00:01:24,883 --> 00:01:27,679
And if you think she'd wanna bang you
if she didn't have a boyfriend,

12
00:01:27,825 --> 00:01:29,752
you'd lie and wait.
Eventually, that would end,

13
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,386
- you'd be in like Flynn.
- Totally!

14
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,687
Is that why you guys never get laid,
always waiting for a relationship stand?

15
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:37,404
E., last night, you thought
you were on a date with the girl.

16
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:39,655
I'm not sure you can let that go
and be professional.

17
00:01:39,786 --> 00:01:41,778
- Well, I am sure.
- Then when are you asking?

18
00:01:41,924 --> 00:01:43,542
I'm just making sure you're OK with it.

19
00:01:43,704 --> 00:01:44,810
Are you OK with it?

20
00:01:45,168 --> 00:01:47,379
Not all clients are as easy as me.
And actresses...?

21
00:01:47,606 --> 00:01:49,086
- Forget it!
- Oh, yeah!

22
00:01:49,297 --> 00:01:52,427
The girl's in town, alright?
It's a great way to expend our business.

23
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,362
- Our business?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:54,496 --> 00:01:56,951
I've been thinking.
You and I 50/50 on every client I hit.

25
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:58,569
- When do I fit in?
- You don't.

26
00:01:58,715 --> 00:02:00,471
You know, that's sweet,
but not necessary.

27
00:02:00,731 --> 00:02:02,428
Look, I know where I'd be without you!

28
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,628
Nowhere!

29
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:05,514
Don't you have a job to go to, Drama?

30
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:07,729
That's the beauty of an ensemble cast!

31
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:09,341
It's who they work with.

32
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:10,984
E., it is not necessary.

33
00:02:11,113 --> 00:02:13,959
Great! There're other people
who're recognizing what you do for me,

34
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:15,503
and I wish you nothing but success.

35
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:16,904
I only ask that you make sure

36
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:18,889
that my career attention
does not suffer.

37
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:21,498
Yeah, E. Look after <i>Numero uno.</i>

38
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:23,384
Always, always, always!

39
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:29,408
I have Dana Gordon.

40
00:02:29,578 --> 00:02:31,953
Weird ! I used to push up
on top of Dana Gordon like this!

41
00:02:32,091 --> 00:02:33,115
True story.

42
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:37,603
Dana! I was just thinking about you!

43
00:02:37,993 --> 00:02:40,026
Did you read Billy Walsh's script?

44
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:41,659
<i>Did I get Billy Walsh's script?</i>

45
00:02:41,903 --> 00:02:42,928
I got it this morning.

46
00:02:43,627 --> 00:02:46,576
- Do I have Billy Walsh's script?
- No, I've just brought it out.

47
00:02:46,722 --> 00:02:48,739
Call Walsh and find out
why I didn't have a chance

48
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:50,511
to comment on it before he turned it in.

49
00:02:50,644 --> 00:02:52,208
Just got it! How's it feeling?

50
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:55,851
I'm on page 12 and I do not understand
what I'm reading.

51
00:02:56,078 --> 00:02:58,525
You didn't understand <i>Titanic</i>
after 12 pages either, Dana.

52
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,683
Ari? This is totally fucked, OK?

53
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,992
- And this is not what we bought.
- What do you mean?

54
00:03:03,138 --> 00:03:04,934
Read the thing, Ari!

55
00:03:07,369 --> 00:03:08,556
I left a word for Walsh.

56
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:12,182
Keep trying him! Call E. and make sure
that Vince is reading this as well!

57
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:15,840
I can't hear you, Lloyd!
I'm in the Hills!

58
00:03:15,986 --> 00:03:17,766
Did you get the Billy Walsh's script?

59
00:03:18,937 --> 00:03:20,368
Lloyd, I can't hear you!

60
00:03:21,538 --> 00:03:23,099
Did you get...

61
00:03:23,392 --> 00:03:25,376
the Billy Walsh's...

62
00:03:25,603 --> 00:03:27,880
- script!
- Shut the fuck up, Lloyd!

63
00:03:31,016 --> 00:03:32,301
No cell reception up here.

64
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:34,772
Yeah, I got that. Do you have
a hardline here by chance?

65
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:36,593
- I don't know.
- Thanks, man.

66
00:03:36,994 --> 00:03:38,441
- Here's my guy!
- Hey!

67
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:40,189
- Hey!
- How are you?

68
00:03:41,587 --> 00:03:44,234
- So, Vince is OK with this?
- Yeah, he was totally cool.

69
00:03:44,405 --> 00:03:46,185
Smart move! I would have
fought him for you,

70
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:48,926
- I'm a freaky sister on you.
- I'm glad it didn't come to that.

71
00:03:49,136 --> 00:03:51,493
Me too. I'm sorry
for putting you to work day one.

72
00:03:51,623 --> 00:03:53,769
It's just I've got to summon up
my inner supermodel.

73
00:03:53,964 --> 00:03:57,103
I got these people coming at me
with concepts, interviews, wardrobe...

74
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:59,036
I'm so thankful you're here to help!

75
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,305
I'm glad to do it.
Fashion isn't my thing,

76
00:04:01,496 --> 00:04:03,853
but if you really want my opinion,
I liked the black outfit

77
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:06,885
you wore on your 1st scary movie.
Made you look smart, some kind of hot.

78
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:09,145
- You remember that?
- Yeah, it was on...

79
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:11,771
It's a cable like... a year ago.

80
00:04:12,572 --> 00:04:14,588
And I... I might have bought the DVD.

81
00:04:14,745 --> 00:04:16,923
Watch it just turn it. My job, you know.

82
00:04:17,598 --> 00:04:18,607
Right.

83
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,472
We are gonna be great together,
E. Really great.

84
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:22,984
- I'm so excited!
- Me too!

85
00:04:24,724 --> 00:04:25,789
What'up, girl?

86
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:27,452
- Hey, Dave!
- Hey, baby!

87
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:31,256
This the guy I was telling you about, E.

88
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:33,777
- This is my boyfriend, Dave.
- Hey, Dave. How are you?

89
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:36,538
- You're the new manager, Dog?
- Yeah!

90
00:04:37,286 --> 00:04:39,562
I... thought you'd be a little older.

91
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:41,124
I'm older than I look.

92
00:04:42,294 --> 00:04:43,351
Alright.

93
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:46,264
- So!
- So...

94
00:04:47,614 --> 00:04:50,899
So, why don't you ask the new manager
what he thinks of my idea?

95
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,428
Dave, I...

96
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:55,208
What? Yo, check this, OK?

97
00:04:55,476 --> 00:04:59,099
I want them to shoot Anna
in a series of animal poses, OK?

98
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:02,161
Like when she sticks her neck up
like this, alright? It's like a girafe.

99
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,911
Alright? In another one,
we would make her hair really big,

100
00:05:05,057 --> 00:05:06,277
to be like a lion.

101
00:05:06,878 --> 00:05:08,797
- What do you think?
- That's interesting...

102
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,406
What do you really think?

103
00:05:12,163 --> 00:05:14,764
I think it's a little weird.
No offense, Dave, but... it is.

104
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:16,585
It is a little weird, Dave.

105
00:05:17,154 --> 00:05:18,569
Well, I thought it'd be hot.

106
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:21,967
You think everything I do is hot,
and that's why I love you.

107
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:25,305
But this is a little weird,
so let's let it go, please.

108
00:05:27,262 --> 00:05:28,498
I'm gonna go get ready.

109
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:31,298
Yo, Dog.

110
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:34,289
I'm gonna watch my girl get ready, OK?

111
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:37,265
So, why don't you grab me a coke,
and bring it over to the trailer?

112
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,785
Alright? Yeah. They're right there.

113
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:41,219
Thanks, Dog.

114
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:43,250
I'll bring that right over.

115
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:51,857
- Yeah?
- Hello?

116
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,131
- Hey, Ari what's up?
- What's up, Lloyd?

117
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:56,277
- I'm looking for Vince.
- Do you know where's Vince?

118
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:58,155
Aren't you supposed
to go through E for Vince?

119
00:05:58,204 --> 00:06:00,410
- You try E.?
- If he's here, put him on the phone!

120
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,973
I called E. and e-mailed him too.

121
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,292
- I'll see if he's here.
- I'll see if I can locate him.

122
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,650
- Vince, you hear of Ari?
- Why wouldn't I be?

123
00:06:06,718 --> 00:06:07,864
Lloyd says he can't find E.

124
00:06:08,437 --> 00:06:09,516
It's fine.

125
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:11,723
- Hey, Lloyd!
- Hey, Vince. Hold for Ari.

126
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,225
- Okay.
- I got Ari, Vince.

127
00:06:13,843 --> 00:06:14,998
- Alright.
- Ari!

128
00:06:16,228 --> 00:06:18,134
- I got Vince!
- I got fucking Vince!

129
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:20,425
<i>- Vince!</i>
- Ari!

130
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,289
- Did you read Walsh's script?
- Did I get Walsh's script?

131
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:25,845
Well, it was dropped off to me
in the studio this morning.

132
00:06:25,906 --> 00:06:27,409
Any scripts come for us this morning?

133
00:06:27,493 --> 00:06:28,686
Yeah, I put them on the pile.

134
00:06:28,915 --> 00:06:30,483
Yeah, I got it. What's the problem?

135
00:06:30,737 --> 00:06:33,441
<i>The problem is he took
your snow on a mountain movie</i>

136
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,650
<i>and turned it
into a futuristic thriller,</i>

137
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,974
set on a farm, circa 2075!

138
00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:41,837
- I don't understand.
- <i>He tossed the book away!</i>

139
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:44,167
The book they paid him $3m to write,

140
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:46,312
and decided just to make up
his own story.

141
00:06:46,951 --> 00:06:48,540
That's odd.
Call Walsh.

142
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,782
Dana Gordon on one.

143
00:06:49,904 --> 00:06:51,322
Did E. know anythin about this?

144
00:06:51,406 --> 00:06:53,532
- Of course, not.
- Then why is he in hiding?

145
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:55,776
He's not. He's at a photo shoot
with his new client.

146
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,072
E.'s got a new client?

147
00:06:57,246 --> 00:06:58,523
Yeah, Anna Farris.

148
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:00,902
Come on!

149
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:03,830
Jesus! The world is falling apart!

150
00:07:04,018 --> 00:07:05,933
It's always darkest before dawn, Ari.

151
00:07:06,215 --> 00:07:07,285
I got Billy's voice mail.

152
00:07:07,717 --> 00:07:09,877
Billy Walsh just said
in response to your question

153
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:11,697
why did he give the script to the studio

154
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:14,509
before you had a chance to comment
on it, and I'm quoting him:

155
00:07:14,582 --> 00:07:16,455
"Because I don't give a fuck
what you think."

156
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:18,065
Get his address.

157
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:21,552
Sit tight, I will get right back to you.

158
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,527
Bye, Ari.

159
00:07:23,802 --> 00:07:26,095
- Boy, he's stressed!
- You want me to call E.?

160
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,960
No, I'm the producer, I can handle it.

161
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:31,161
Let's just see what crazy Billy did.

162
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,806
- How about I read this copy?
- Yeah, I like the initiative, Turtle.

163
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:37,196
What should I do?

164
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:38,908
Why don't you make us a snack?

165
00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:41,627
I like being E.

166
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:48,678
Hot, so hot!
Perfect!

167
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,462
Run into it!

168
00:07:55,978 --> 00:07:58,128
You can get a signal
right at the bottom of the hill.

169
00:07:58,213 --> 00:08:00,346
Or we have a runner.
We could send him make the call.

170
00:08:00,431 --> 00:08:02,031
No, thanks.
I'll go down to call.

171
00:08:02,143 --> 00:08:03,725
- Thanks, I appreciate.
- No problem!

172
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,645
- She looks good, huh?
- No, I'm not feeling a shit at all.

173
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,011
Baby?

174
00:08:11,381 --> 00:08:12,648
Do it like a cat, OK?

175
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,906
Ears cats.

176
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:15,681
Just jump out.

177
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:18,241
Baby, trust me on this OK? Please?

178
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:21,085
Hey guys, like an hour,
and this shit is gonna pop.

179
00:08:21,996 --> 00:08:23,508
Come on, Dave...

180
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:25,323
OK, am I wrong, dog?

181
00:08:25,736 --> 00:08:28,393
Little reckless abandon in here
It'll stand this thing unique.

182
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:29,595
I think she looks beautiful.

183
00:08:32,252 --> 00:08:33,332
Fucking hack!

184
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:36,608
Are you cool if I ran down
the bottom of the hill to make a call?

185
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,739
- Yeah.
- OK, I'll be right back.

186
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,162
Alright, everyone. Let's take five.

187
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,216
Alright, sir.
It's Eric, right?

188
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:46,818
- Yeah!
- You can't leave now.

189
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,976
- Why not?
- I didn't get what I need out of Anna.

190
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:50,610
She's not focused.

191
00:08:51,043 --> 00:08:52,161
Alright. I'll talk to her.

192
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,588
No, she's not the problem.
The boyfriend is.

193
00:08:54,907 --> 00:08:56,841
As long as he's hanging around
critisizing her,

194
00:08:56,925 --> 00:08:58,155
she's not gonna bring it.

195
00:08:58,249 --> 00:09:00,350
- You wanna say something to him?
- I take pictures.

196
00:09:00,461 --> 00:09:02,227
I don't interfere with domesticity.

197
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:03,863
Alright. I'll say something to him.

198
00:09:05,903 --> 00:09:07,076
Don't touch the camera.

199
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:09,508
Can I talk to you for a second?

200
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,593
Listen...

201
00:09:11,997 --> 00:09:14,053
I think you're making Anna
a little uncomfortable.

202
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:17,650
You've been working with her... what?
One day?

203
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,858
How do you know?

204
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,974
Maybe you're making
the photographer uncomfortable.

205
00:09:20,998 --> 00:09:23,190
if you hang around,
try to be a little less critical.

206
00:09:23,236 --> 00:09:24,409
No, this is not good, OK?

207
00:09:24,466 --> 00:09:25,987
I'm not feeling this.

208
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:28,129
Anna, baby?

209
00:09:30,165 --> 00:09:32,156
I need to talk to you for a second.

210
00:09:32,466 --> 00:09:33,538
In the trailer.

211
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:35,270
Excuse me.

212
00:09:54,971 --> 00:09:55,971
- Hi.
- Hi.

213
00:09:56,044 --> 00:09:57,240
Is Billy Walsh here?

214
00:09:57,553 --> 00:09:59,281
No, Billy's not here.

215
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:02,632
I see him sitting on the couch there.

216
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:05,100
She means I'm not here for you Ari.

217
00:10:05,494 --> 00:10:06,542
Can I please come in.

218
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,927
Not if you gonna critizise me.

219
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,875
Critizise...
Why would I critizise you?

220
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:12,079
Let him in.

221
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,368
So everyone hates this script.

222
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:22,013
You got paid a half a million dollars
to adapt the book and you didn't do it.

223
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:23,770
Decided to go on a different direction.

224
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,721
They didn't pay you for that direction.

225
00:10:26,107 --> 00:10:28,124
The script that he wrote
is really hot, man.

226
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,207
You don't want to give the studio back
their money, do you?

227
00:10:34,378 --> 00:10:35,830
- The money's been spent.
- On what?

228
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:38,488
- Home improvements.
- We put in a steam shower

229
00:10:38,912 --> 00:10:41,473
How long will it take you
to do what they paid you to do?

230
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,369
Infinity, cause I'm not gonna do it.

231
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,711
You have to do it.

232
00:10:44,974 --> 00:10:46,608
I tried to do it Ari,

233
00:10:46,976 --> 00:10:48,903
I did, but everytime
I started to write a scene,

234
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:53,128
I got these 2 guys locked alone
on a moutain and it felt really gay.

235
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,825
And it was my idea to add the chicks.
See, Billy raises chicks really good

236
00:10:58,054 --> 00:10:59,118
Thanks baby.

237
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:02,265
Vince stops his neckout for you
and now you are fucking him.

238
00:11:02,477 --> 00:11:03,630
And the studio.

239
00:11:03,825 --> 00:11:06,400
- They are going to fuck you right back.
- They can't touch me.

240
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:08,999
They can sue you and make sure

241
00:11:09,173 --> 00:11:11,351
that you never make a movie
in this town again.

242
00:11:11,536 --> 00:11:12,950
Well good thing I paint.

243
00:11:14,824 --> 00:11:16,306
You are not gonna do this, are you?

244
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:17,632
No, I'm not.

245
00:11:18,827 --> 00:11:20,486
Then I got nothing else to say to you.

246
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,443
Yeah well,
I got something to say to you:

247
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:28,175
you are no longer my agent!

248
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:33,798
- It's your wife, she says it's urgent.
- <i>Put her through Lloyd.</i>

249
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,725
- Here she is.
- What's wrong baby?

250
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,603
You're avoiding my fucking calls.

251
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:40,819
Does thats sound like my wife, Lloyd?

252
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:43,150
Indeed yes, but now it doesn't, sorry.

253
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:44,668
What's up Danna?

254
00:11:44,848 --> 00:11:48,653
I haven't walked out of my office,
not even to pee, in 3 hours.

255
00:11:48,985 --> 00:11:50,138
What are you, agorophobic?

256
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:54,238
No, I'm scared to see my boss,
because I have no idea what to tell him.

257
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:57,974
Well that is the beauty of me, Danna,
I tell people what to tell other people.

258
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,291
So tell me something.

259
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:00,496
Fire Walsh.

260
00:12:00,665 --> 00:12:02,522
- <i>Fire him?</i>
- <i>Yes, I just did.</i>

261
00:12:02,674 --> 00:12:05,530
So he has no intention of writing
what he was supposed to write?

262
00:12:05,736 --> 00:12:07,175
<i>None, but I have intentions</i>

263
00:12:07,297 --> 00:12:09,248
<i>of finding you
an alias writer director</i>

264
00:12:09,484 --> 00:12:13,240
to replace him by sundown
and I will bring him at any cost.

265
00:12:14,188 --> 00:12:16,078
- <i>Get a list together.</i>
- <i>I can't believe this.</i>

266
00:12:16,273 --> 00:12:17,712
<i>Wake up Danna, it's real.</i>

267
00:12:18,065 --> 00:12:19,480
<i>The first big project you brought</i>

268
00:12:19,626 --> 00:12:21,636
in your new studio is in shambles!

269
00:12:21,777 --> 00:12:24,241
Thanks to your writer/director asshole.

270
00:12:24,436 --> 00:12:25,928
<i>You know, if you think my last boss</i>

271
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,400
was vindictive,
you haven't seen shit,

272
00:12:28,641 --> 00:12:30,319
<i>you better find me someone approvable,</i>

273
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:32,340
and you better make sure
that Vince is on board

274
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,853
because if I have to go in
and tell Richard Wimmer,

275
00:12:35,074 --> 00:12:37,540
that we lost a script, a director,

276
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:41,384
and a story today,
all of who are your fucking clients,

277
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,712
<i>you can bet your ass that nobody</i>

278
00:12:43,859 --> 00:12:45,992
who has ever been close enough
to smell your breath,

279
00:12:46,193 --> 00:12:48,399
will ever
be welcome at the studio again.

280
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,956
- It's Ari
- I'll call him when I'm finished.

281
00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:02,086
Some help this guy is.

282
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,881
I'm not sleeping jerkoff,
I'm pacing myself.

283
00:13:05,138 --> 00:13:06,547
Yeah, were you enjoying it Turtle?

284
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,954
Yeah, don't get mad, Vin, but,

285
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,906
but I kind of
scanned it for the sex scenes,

286
00:13:10,027 --> 00:13:11,754
There are two good ones,
by the way.

287
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:13,612
There are a lot of parts in here Vince.

288
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,543
Billy liked the way
you did in Medellin.

289
00:13:15,763 --> 00:13:16,909
- Right?
- No.

290
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,932
I really do need E.
Call him, Turtle.

291
00:13:20,093 --> 00:13:21,093
I can finish man.

292
00:13:21,246 --> 00:13:22,269
Call him.

293
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:23,537
Call him, Turtle.

294
00:13:28,532 --> 00:13:29,849
Straight to voicemail.

295
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:32,686
Nice, very nice.

296
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:40,441
Excuse me miss,
can you make a call for me?

297
00:13:40,635 --> 00:13:41,657
Sure.
Who's the call to?

298
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:44,486
The call is to Ari Gold,
at the Miller Gold Agency.

299
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,100
And you gonna ask for Lloyd,

300
00:13:46,282 --> 00:13:48,234
and see if
there is anything important going on.

301
00:13:48,404 --> 00:13:50,142
- You got it.
- Thank you very much.

302
00:13:52,088 --> 00:13:53,821
Hey guy.
You are her manager?

303
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,213
Well, can you manage her?

304
00:13:55,316 --> 00:13:57,287
We're ready,
she's not coming out of her trailer.

305
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,800
She's just talking to her boyfriend.

306
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,751
Look, once the sun is over that tree,
we're done, We can't shoot.

307
00:14:02,771 --> 00:14:03,917
Okay, I take care of it.

308
00:14:19,748 --> 00:14:20,748
You wanna talk?

309
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:22,730
Sorry to bother you, Dave... interrupt.

310
00:14:22,851 --> 00:14:25,739
- But they're ready for all on set.
- We're in the middle of something.

311
00:14:25,836 --> 00:14:27,812
I really have to go.
We'll talk about this later.

312
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,360
What's more important:
this relationship or this photo shoot.

313
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:32,412
Don't do that, I have to work.

314
00:14:32,534 --> 00:14:33,962
Oh, and I'm sorry, I don't.

315
00:14:35,502 --> 00:14:37,629
- Oh my God.
- Fuck this.

316
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:39,988
I'm out

317
00:14:40,622 --> 00:14:42,110
I'm really sorry.

318
00:14:42,402 --> 00:14:43,619
He never used to be like this,

319
00:14:43,741 --> 00:14:45,717
but since CW passed on his pilot,.

320
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,625
he's been hanging around my work
beeing all hypercritical.

321
00:14:50,732 --> 00:14:52,013
God, you must think I'm a mess.

322
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:55,189
Look, relationships are tough,
I'm sure you guys will get trought it.

323
00:14:56,143 --> 00:14:57,476
Does the crew totaly hate me?

324
00:14:57,598 --> 00:15:00,281
Not at all, everyting's fine.
You're good, you need a minute?

325
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:01,433
No, no, I'm good.

326
00:15:01,531 --> 00:15:03,367
- Okay, here, come on.
- Okay, thank you.

327
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:04,661
How's that dress feel?

328
00:15:04,748 --> 00:15:07,030
- It's really uncomfortable.
- I agree, right?

329
00:15:08,515 --> 00:15:10,406
You needed me to go
make a phone call for you.

330
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,284
Just confirming,
who I was suppose to call?

331
00:15:12,455 --> 00:15:14,303
You wanna talk to Lloyd
in Ari Gold's office.

332
00:15:14,406 --> 00:15:16,554
If you need to go make
some phone calls, that's fine.

333
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:17,943
- You're sure?
- Totally.

334
00:15:18,031 --> 00:15:19,445
Alright, I'll be back in 5 minutes.

335
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:21,884
- Hey, E.?
- Yeah?

336
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:24,320
I swear I'm not
as a high maintenance as it seems.

337
00:15:24,762 --> 00:15:27,842
Don't worry, as far as my easiest client
are concerned, you're in the top 2.

338
00:15:27,947 --> 00:15:28,978
Not bad!

339
00:15:29,403 --> 00:15:30,611
I'll be back in 2 seconds!

340
00:15:30,747 --> 00:15:31,758
I'm sorry.

341
00:15:31,991 --> 00:15:33,052
So sorry, guys.

342
00:15:34,887 --> 00:15:36,497
Making house calls, I love it.

343
00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:39,182
Today is not the day
to not pick up your phone.

344
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:42,821
I was reading, you should be proud!
Normally you can't get me to do that.

345
00:15:42,939 --> 00:15:45,265
Well today, I actually
don't need you to do that.

346
00:15:45,481 --> 00:15:47,753
I made some lamb kebabs,
you want some?

347
00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:49,236
- No, thank you.
- They're good.

348
00:15:49,411 --> 00:15:51,433
No, thank you.
You know Richard Kelly?

349
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,850
- The director?
- Yeah, the guy did Donnie Darko.

350
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:55,564
I know him, I like him, why?

351
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,836
I represent him,
I can get him on <i>Clouds</i>.

352
00:15:57,961 --> 00:16:00,936
Plus I get the studio on board
so we can keep this train rolling.

353
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,127
What about Billy?

354
00:16:02,748 --> 00:16:04,836
Billy is a dead man.
He's a corpse.

355
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:08,250
You can't pull that kind of shit
when you get paid that kind of money!

356
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,453
Did you read his script?

357
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,256
I understand
that you're loyal to the guy.

358
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,443
But did you read it?

359
00:16:12,511 --> 00:16:14,536
I read the first ten pages
but there's no moutain.

360
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:16,268
Without a moutain, there's no movie!

361
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,637
No, there is a movie, a great movie,
better than <i>Clouds</i>, I think.

362
00:16:20,722 --> 00:16:23,292
- Are you fucking with me?
- Why would I do that, Ari?

363
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,440
Is he fucking with me?

364
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,172
<i>Clouds</i> was lacking in tits.
This one's got at least 4.

365
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,571
Yeah there is a couple of things
in there for me too.

366
00:16:30,644 --> 00:16:32,548
So you and Lloyd
should get on it ASAP.

367
00:16:34,014 --> 00:16:35,160
Where the hell is E.?

368
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,010
M.I.A.

369
00:16:37,556 --> 00:16:40,201
Well, we need him
because maybe that neurotic little elf

370
00:16:40,388 --> 00:16:42,827
nipping at your heels
will make you understand

371
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:45,629
that we are in a major
crisis situation here.

372
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:49,249
I think if you read the script,
you'd find that we're not. Come on.

373
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:52,183
And Ari, the tide is turning for us,
you know that.

374
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:54,976
And the hype of <i>Medelin</i>
is growing as Cannes approches,

375
00:16:55,313 --> 00:16:58,459
I like this script,
I wanna make this movie, with Billy.

376
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,230
We can't do that!
There is no way!

377
00:17:01,681 --> 00:17:05,614
There is always a way Ari.
Come on, make it happen, huh?

378
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:17,081
You're following me Dog?

379
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,917
No, just trying to make a phone call.

380
00:17:19,012 --> 00:17:20,159
Why are you right on my ass?

381
00:17:20,328 --> 00:17:21,938
I'm not, I didn't even know
it was you.

382
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:23,204
Oh, you didn't?
Okay.

383
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,754
You got a think from my girl?

384
00:17:25,889 --> 00:17:27,705
We work together,
what are you talking about?

385
00:17:27,773 --> 00:17:28,968
- You got a girlfriend?
- No.

386
00:17:29,171 --> 00:17:30,196
- You're gay?
- No.

387
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:31,683
Look at me at my face right now

388
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:33,719
and tell me
you ain't got a think for my girl.

389
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:35,358
You gotta chill.

390
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:36,994
Don't tell me to chill, okay?

391
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:40,262
My girlfriend, she comes and tells me
she's getting a new manager

392
00:17:40,402 --> 00:17:42,171
I'm thinking it's gonna be
some great beard

393
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,445
Bernie Bernstein type
and not some young

394
00:17:44,616 --> 00:17:46,164
none gay guy who ain't got no girl!

395
00:17:46,347 --> 00:17:49,101
I promise you this relationship
is gonna be nothing but professional.

396
00:17:49,139 --> 00:17:51,394
Professional? How are you
gonna help her professionally?

397
00:17:51,443 --> 00:17:53,193
Why don't you sell me
however you sold her?

398
00:17:53,242 --> 00:17:56,168
I didn't sell her. I told her I didn't
like the movie she was gonna do

399
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,949
and she agreed
with my opinion, that's it.

400
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:02,161
So you're the reason she didn't do it.

401
00:18:02,568 --> 00:18:04,244
That's fine.
You know that's really fine,

402
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:06,217
because I was the reason
she was gonna do it!

403
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,633
What can I say about that?
I'm just trying to do that job,

404
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,926
Your job's fucking with my life, okay?

405
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,021
And... you never got me that coke!

406
00:18:17,212 --> 00:18:18,456
This is not happening.

407
00:18:30,515 --> 00:18:32,263
Are you out of your fucking mind?

408
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:34,676
Did you even read Walsh's script?

409
00:18:34,825 --> 00:18:37,633
I read 15 pages
and I will not read another page

410
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,139
nor another page
of any client you ever have.

411
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,893
I need to get you behind this.

412
00:18:42,052 --> 00:18:44,007
I'm not behind this
and I never will be.

413
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,980
Listen, you better get behind this
if you want to save your ass.

414
00:18:47,104 --> 00:18:49,397
<i>Save my ass?
People love </i>Clouds.

415
00:18:49,615 --> 00:18:51,702
I will replace you
and your whole fucking crew,

416
00:18:51,818 --> 00:18:52,881
with 3 phone calls.

417
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,951
<i>And after this if I hear that
you tried to bait and switch the studio,</i>

418
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:58,198
it will be your ass
that needs the saving.

419
00:18:58,295 --> 00:19:00,076
So you're not gonna take this
to your boss?

420
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:01,807
<i>- No!</i>
- Then I will.

421
00:19:02,021 --> 00:19:04,404
- Really?
- <i>Hi, Ari Gold to see Richard Wimmer.</i>

422
00:19:04,586 --> 00:19:05,586
Really!

423
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:08,262
You motherfucking cocksucker.

424
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:10,647
He's leaving for New York in 30 minutes.

425
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,795
I will be a minute.

426
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,220
No, he's in the shower!

427
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:37,306
I'm not a fighter Dog. But when
it comes to my girl, I will man up.

428
00:19:37,379 --> 00:19:38,379
So back off, ok?

429
00:19:38,433 --> 00:19:40,658
You're no fighting me man,
you fighting yourself here.

430
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:42,838
Don't use that weird existential shit
with me.

431
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:45,874
Would you just talk to me for one second
before you go back over to her?

432
00:19:46,109 --> 00:19:47,182
- One.
- Listen.

433
00:19:47,434 --> 00:19:49,973
One. One.
That was like 3 seconds.

434
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:51,281
Only 6.

435
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,767
You want to lose your girl?

436
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,652
You go back over there
with that attitude,

437
00:19:54,774 --> 00:19:56,128
that's exactly what will happen.

438
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,497
You'd like that wouldn't you?

439
00:19:57,616 --> 00:20:00,143
What the fuck Dave?
You've come to cause more problems?

440
00:20:00,216 --> 00:20:01,957
Girl, I haven't caused shit!
It's this guy.

441
00:20:01,982 --> 00:20:04,232
The only reason he's here...
is he's trying to fuck you.

442
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,915
- What?
- I'm just trying to do my job!

443
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:07,232
You need to get rid of him.

444
00:20:07,634 --> 00:20:08,854
Baby, I'm just keeping it real.

445
00:20:08,903 --> 00:20:11,586
Ask him, right now, to look you
in the face and say it isn't so.

446
00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:13,073
- Do it, go on!
- Dave, stop it!

447
00:20:13,074 --> 00:20:14,122
Maybe I should leave.

448
00:20:14,195 --> 00:20:15,659
Yeah, why don't you do that, please?

449
00:20:15,732 --> 00:20:17,220
No, dog, why don't you?

450
00:20:18,464 --> 00:20:20,244
I can't take anymore!
I'm done!

451
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:23,915
- That shit ain't right.
- Stop talking like Randy Jackson!

452
00:20:28,002 --> 00:20:29,344
Whatever, movie star, I...

453
00:20:29,514 --> 00:20:31,588
I hope you two
are really happy together, alright?

454
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:41,814
Well...

455
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,497
that was awkard.

456
00:20:43,972 --> 00:20:44,972
You alright?

457
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:46,533
No, I meant for you...

458
00:20:49,424 --> 00:20:51,717
Okay, come on.
Let's go back to work.

459
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:01,976
Finally!

460
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:04,726
Yo, Billy! Where have you been all day?

461
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:06,401
It's not Billy, Vince. It's Cat.

462
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,857
Billy's locked himself in the bathroom
with a bottle of whisky and a gun.

463
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:13,350
- What are you talking about?
<i>- He thinks he let you down.</i>

464
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:16,108
<i>- He feels terrible.</i>
- No, he didn't let me down!

465
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:18,186
Vince! E.?

466
00:21:19,386 --> 00:21:20,438
Let me talk to him.

467
00:21:20,795 --> 00:21:23,658
Billy? Baby, it's Vince!
He wants to talk to you.

468
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,038
What's to say? I've ruined us all!

469
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,338
No! Baby, he says that it's all good!

470
00:21:29,174 --> 00:21:30,751
What's all good? He liked the script?

471
00:21:31,014 --> 00:21:32,347
Tell him I love the script!

472
00:21:32,422 --> 00:21:34,563
He loved the script, baby. He loved it!

473
00:21:38,303 --> 00:21:39,870
- You loved it?
<i>- It's unbelievable!</i>

474
00:21:39,936 --> 00:21:41,091
You really have a gun?

475
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,147
Yeah, but the bitch
had the bullets all out.

476
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:44,527
<i>Jesus, Billy!</i>

477
00:21:44,715 --> 00:21:46,884
The script is amazing.
I wanna make this movie.

478
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,199
- You do?
<i>- Yes.</i>

479
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:50,358
- We're going to make this movie.
- How?

480
00:21:50,485 --> 00:21:51,977
Ari's taking care of it, don't worry.

481
00:21:52,043 --> 00:21:53,677
Ari? What can he do?

482
00:21:57,095 --> 00:21:59,214
Wow, it's like finding
Jim Morrison alive.

483
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:01,758
Yeah, I had no cell all day.
I got like 25 messages!

484
00:22:01,824 --> 00:22:03,599
- What's going on?
- Nothing that exciting.

485
00:22:03,693 --> 00:22:05,834
Just an emergency meeting
with the head of the studio

486
00:22:05,918 --> 00:22:07,599
on the Billy Walsh/Vinny Chase project.

487
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:09,609
- What's the problem?
- Would you like to know?

488
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:11,825
- Ari!
- You snooze, you lose. I gotta go!

489
00:22:17,654 --> 00:22:19,607
- What the hell is going on?
- Desperate times

490
00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:21,232
call for desperate measures here.

491
00:22:21,325 --> 00:22:22,424
Thank God I'm in a robe.

492
00:22:22,522 --> 00:22:24,719
And, may I comment on
what lovely ankles you have!

493
00:22:24,784 --> 00:22:27,047
- Talk fast, Ari.
- You don't have your summer movie?

494
00:22:27,444 --> 00:22:29,735
- Come again?
- At ten poll, you don't have one!

495
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,172
I have <i>Clouds!</i>

496
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:33,336
Billy Walsh and Vinny Chase
don't wanna do it.

497
00:22:33,622 --> 00:22:35,031
Where the hell is Dana Gordon?

498
00:22:35,106 --> 00:22:38,062
I'm right outside the door, Richard!
Ari locked me out!

499
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:39,354
Let her in!

500
00:22:42,502 --> 00:22:44,136
- Hey, Dana!
- Fuck you, Ari!

501
00:22:44,211 --> 00:22:45,831
What's the hell's going on with <i>Clouds</i>?

502
00:22:45,915 --> 00:22:48,112
I'm working on it.
When you return from New York,

503
00:22:48,178 --> 00:22:49,859
I'll have
a completely new team in place.

504
00:22:49,948 --> 00:22:52,943
Impossible! Billy burned 6 weeks
writing the wrong script.

505
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,159
And you don't have enough time to put
<i>Clouds</i> back on board

506
00:22:56,226 --> 00:22:57,256
for your July release.

507
00:22:57,322 --> 00:22:59,228
You and your friend Billy Walsh
are dear!

508
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:01,510
No, we are not dead.
We are very much alive.

509
00:23:01,585 --> 00:23:04,852
You, with your fading star prizes
and your 3 straight quarters in the red

510
00:23:04,957 --> 00:23:07,095
are dead if you're to go
to your board of directors,

511
00:23:07,144 --> 00:23:09,712
and tell them that this summer
may be a worse quarter yet.

512
00:23:09,787 --> 00:23:11,130
I'm gonna tear your head off!

513
00:23:11,205 --> 00:23:13,534
Please don't,
because I have your summer movie.

514
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,348
From the director of <i>Medellin</i>
and <i>Queens Boulevard,</i> comes <i>Silo</i>.

515
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:22,245
It is the story of a group
of non unionized farmhands

516
00:23:22,386 --> 00:23:25,731
who band together
to survive a nuclear attack

517
00:23:25,813 --> 00:23:28,635
after discovering
an underground society.

518
00:23:28,785 --> 00:23:29,921
It's ready to shoot.

519
00:23:30,005 --> 00:23:32,512
Billy Walsh's on board,
Vinny Chase is on board,

520
00:23:32,571 --> 00:23:36,296
and if you're not,
Fox, Universal and Sony are.

521
00:23:36,543 --> 00:23:37,554
He's bluffing.

522
00:23:37,676 --> 00:23:39,726
What's it matter?
There's a summer movie in there,

523
00:23:39,806 --> 00:23:41,158
we pack up our shit and go home!

524
00:23:41,805 --> 00:23:44,665
Tell him how good it is, Dana.
All personal bullshit aside.

525
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,116
- It's an excellent script.
- Can we market it!

526
00:23:52,938 --> 00:23:55,708
Think... <i>Blade Runner</i>
meets <i>Field of Dreams</i>.

527
00:23:55,783 --> 00:23:57,313
Two classics! Boom!

528
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,252
You make this good, Dana.

529
00:23:59,623 --> 00:24:01,747
And you, Ari, this I don't soon forget.

530
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:07,001
That was unbelievable.
<i>Blade Runner</i> meets <i>Field of Dreams</i>?

531
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,210
- Not bad, huh?
- You actually read it?

532
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,551
What do we need to read it for?
I'll go to the movies!

533
00:24:11,636 --> 00:24:12,671
We have a gold movie!

534
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:14,678
Die, Ari! I truly hope you die!

535
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:17,659
Did I do it, Vinny?

536
00:24:17,744 --> 00:24:19,391
Yes, you did, and thank you.

537
00:24:19,654 --> 00:24:22,011
So... Any possibility of shooting this

538
00:24:22,058 --> 00:24:24,335
a little closer to civilization,
Bill, please?

539
00:24:24,466 --> 00:24:26,770
It takes place on a farm
in Nova Scotia, Turtle.

540
00:24:26,936 --> 00:24:29,236
Ignore him, Billy.
He read every third page.

541
00:24:29,415 --> 00:24:31,039
I, on the other hand, was riveted!

542
00:24:31,556 --> 00:24:34,354
Especially by the character
of Kelton, the farmhand.

543
00:24:34,448 --> 00:24:36,354
Yeah, I was thinking of you
when I wrote that.

544
00:24:36,885 --> 00:24:38,247
- Really?
- No.

545
00:24:39,194 --> 00:24:40,274
How about a toast?

546
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:43,682
To a groundbreaking day
and a possibly groundbreaking movie!

547
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:46,123
Are you kissing my ass,
now, snake suit?

548
00:24:46,189 --> 00:24:48,904
Come on, Billy! He came through.
You can't stay mad at him!

549
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:51,750
Well, I'm no longer planning on
using your car as a toilet,

550
00:24:51,806 --> 00:24:53,609
but I'll get back to you
by being my agent.

551
00:24:53,674 --> 00:24:55,909
I wait with bated breath, Sir!

552
00:24:57,251 --> 00:24:58,913
Why does nobody answer their cells?

553
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,087
Look who's talking!

554
00:25:00,162 --> 00:25:01,392
Where have you been, E.?

555
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:03,422
Too busy being professional
with your girlfriend

556
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:05,805
- to pick up the phone?
- Please, tell me what's going on.

557
00:25:05,868 --> 00:25:07,964
Don't stress your pretty little head
about it!

558
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,074
- It's all been handled.
- What's been handled?

559
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:11,388
We're making Billy's movie.

560
00:25:13,848 --> 00:25:14,902
<i>Silo</i>?

561
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,389
Where is the snow?
