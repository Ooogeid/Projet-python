I'm up for anything, Billy.

22
00:01:31,386 --> 00:01:33,254
So if you've got a good idea, bring it.

23
00:01:33,288 --> 00:01:35,089
I look forward to the challenge.

24
00:01:35,123 --> 00:01:37,124
- Are you a director?
- Are you kidding?

25
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:40,828
This is Billy Walsh.
Once upon a time he was the best.

26
00:01:40,862 --> 00:01:44,465
- Really?
- Well, it's still in there
but priorities shift.

27
00:01:44,499 --> 00:01:46,901
Oh yeah? What are your priorities now?

28
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:50,071
- I'm married.
- And you're with me tonight, sweetheart.

29
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:51,305
Have a good evening, all right?

30
00:01:51,339 --> 00:01:52,807
Think of something good for me, Billy.

31
00:01:52,841 --> 00:01:55,109
It's marinating, all right?
It's marinating.

32
00:01:55,143 --> 00:01:57,011
What the hell was that?

33
00:01:57,045 --> 00:01:59,814
You had your tongue in
my mouth five minutes ago.

34
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:03,017
You should have seen this kid.

35
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:06,220
He tried to play it off but the kid
was indeed terrified.

36
00:02:06,288 --> 00:02:08,355
- Right or wrong?
- Poor baby.

37
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,291
I'd never jumped out of a plane before.

38
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:11,926
- Did you like it?
- It was amazing.

39
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,962
To be honest, when I got in the air,
I felt complete peace.

40
00:02:14,996 --> 00:02:17,064
- Let's do it again tomorrow.
- Absolutely.

41
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,266
- You're on!
- Ah, hear hear.

42
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:21,368

- Cheers.

You guys have anything besides tequila?

49
00:02:36,585 --> 00:02:39,653
Uh, no. But it's the world's
best so enjoy it, Chris.

50
00:02:39,688 --> 00:02:42,423
Ugh, what is this, like a sponsored party?

51
00:02:42,457 --> 00:02:45,826
No, it's some good free tequila,
so drink up.

52
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:47,595
My girl likes vodka, Turtle.

53
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:50,431
Trust me, Avión Margarita
will change your life.

54
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:52,967
Like playing for the Knicks would have.
Enjoy.

55
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:56,437
I'll give you 1000 bucks
to get me some vodka.

56
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:59,306
<i>- Turtle: Yo, E, what up?
- I just want to make sure Vince is ready</i>

57
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:02,209
- for his meeting tomorrow.
- What's he got to do to get ready?

58
00:03:02,244 --> 00:03:04,311
<i>He's got to rest.</i>

59
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:09,116
<i>- He's resting.
- Look, it's very important</i>

60
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:11,585
that Vince make a better impression
than he did at the last meeting.

61
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,954
<i>- Understood.
- Who's there?</i>

62
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:16,257
Uh, just a few people.

63
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:19,593
- What people?
- We were at goal and Vince
announced an after-party.

64
00:03:19,628 --> 00:03:21,562
Awesome. Do me a favor.

65
00:03:21,596 --> 00:03:23,631
- Make sure the kid's in bed early.
- I'm on it, ma.

66
00:03:23,665 --> 00:03:25,032
<i>- Thanks.
- Later.</i>

67
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:28,235
- What's wrong?
- They're having a party.

68
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,805
- You jealous?
- Jealous of what?

69
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:32,573
Girls, I don't know.

70
00:03:32,607 --> 00:03:34,542
No, are you kidding?
I'm as happy as I can be.

71
00:03:34,576 --> 00:03:36,343
I just want to get Vince's focus back.

72
00:03:36,378 --> 00:03:39,346
Just give me your focus.

73
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,453
Done.

74
00:03:46,488 --> 00:03:48,189
- Good morning, Ari.
- Is it?

75
00:03:48,223 --> 00:03:51,125
<i>- ( Laughs )
- What are you laughing at?</i>

76
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,960
- Nothing.
- Then don't.

77
00:03:52,994 --> 00:03:55,029
- Anything?
- I've been refreshing

78
00:03:55,063 --> 00:03:57,498
"Deadline hollywood" every
15 seconds like you asked.

79
00:03:57,532 --> 00:03:59,834
- Nothing about you on there.
- How is that possible?

80
00:03:59,868 --> 00:04:02,069
Maybe you're not important enough
to warrant a story.

81
00:04:02,103 --> 00:04:04,171
"Deadline hollywood"
would run a story about me

82
00:04:04,206 --> 00:04:06,941
having a loose stool much less
having recorded tapes of me.

83
00:04:06,975 --> 00:04:10,444
Well, you're gonna need to relax
or everyone here is gonna panic as well.

84
00:04:10,478 --> 00:04:12,913
I am not panicked.
I just want to know what's going on.

85
00:04:12,948 --> 00:04:14,315
Get Anna Fowler on the phone.

86
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:16,817
Do not go into the lion's den
without an invite, Ari.

87
00:04:16,852 --> 00:04:20,020
- I'll be fine. I'll give her a scoop.
- Oh, you got one?

88
00:04:20,055 --> 00:04:22,890
Yeah, I'm gonna tell her you blew
Mickey Rooney and gargled with it.

89
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:25,559
- She'll love it.
- I've got Anna.

90
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:27,695
( Sighs )

91
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:29,663
How are you, Anna?

92
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:31,699
Hey, Ari. You calling to gloat?

93
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:35,502
- Gloat about what?
- Lizzie Grant leaving Amanda's.

94
00:04:35,537 --> 00:04:37,771
Leaving? She's been there one day.

95
00:04:37,806 --> 00:04:39,874
Wait, you don't know about this?

96
00:04:39,908 --> 00:04:42,243
<i>- Uh...
- Then why are you calling me?</i>

97
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:44,511
I like you.

98
00:04:44,546 --> 00:04:46,413
I did hear that you and Lizzie

99
00:04:46,448 --> 00:04:49,083
had some angry words when she left you.

100
00:04:49,117 --> 00:04:50,684
That is not true.

101
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:52,386
When she left I was devastated.

102
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,122
<i>Lizzie has been like a daughter to me.</i>

103
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:57,791
But sometimes a good father
has to let his daughter go free

104
00:04:57,826 --> 00:04:59,860
so her wings can finally sprout.

105
00:04:59,895 --> 00:05:02,429
<i>Why the fuck are you calling me then, Ari?</i>

106
00:05:02,464 --> 00:05:04,531
Do I really need to start digging here?

107
00:05:04,566 --> 00:05:07,868
- No.
- Then you'd better give me something.

108
00:05:07,903 --> 00:05:10,371
Howard Stern...

109
00:05:10,405 --> 00:05:12,539
Is gonna be the new host of "Jeopardy."

110
00:05:12,574 --> 00:05:15,042
- Oh, come on.
- You didn't hear it from me.

111
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:17,344
- The N.F.L. peeps are calling.
- I'll call 'em from the road.

112
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:19,446
Is Howard Stern really
gonna host "Jeopardy"?

113
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:21,582
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go see Lizzie.

114
00:05:21,616 --> 00:05:23,384
I think I found a chink in her armor.

115
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:25,286
I don't think you should talk to her, Ari.

116
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,822
I think that you know what I think about
your thoughts, Babs.

117
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:33,527

Love the delivery truck, Turtle.

120
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,068
- It gets the job done.
- How come you still got Alex?

121
00:05:41,102 --> 00:05:43,671
- I thought you got rid of the car service.
- I let him keep me.

122
00:05:43,705 --> 00:05:45,072
- Really?
- Yup.

123
00:05:45,106 --> 00:05:46,874
Thanks for bringing this over, man.

124
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:49,643
Anything I can do to help
spread the word that is Avión.

125
00:05:49,678 --> 00:05:52,513
- How many calls have you gotten today?
- 40 already.

126
00:05:52,547 --> 00:05:54,682
That's sick.
That's just from Vince tweeting.

127
00:05:54,716 --> 00:05:56,250
Wait till we stick his face on billboards.

128
00:05:56,284 --> 00:05:59,053
Listen, who else are you
giving this to in the area?

129
00:05:59,087 --> 00:06:00,921
That stuff's like oil, kid.
Everybody wants it.

130
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:03,490
But I'm ground zero for breaking
product in Hollywood, you know that.

131
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:05,359
You're the first place
in the States to have it.

132
00:06:05,393 --> 00:06:07,594
And if you put it in front the patron
so no one can see that,

133
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:10,264
I won't give anyone else
within three miles stuff for a month.

134
00:06:10,298 --> 00:06:12,700
I think I can make that happen.
How much more can you get me?

135
00:06:12,734 --> 00:06:15,369
- How much do you want?
- I'll take 25 cases to start.

136
00:06:15,403 --> 00:06:17,004
How about I get Vince to tweet

137
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:19,473
that you're the only place in town
that has it, you take 50?

138
00:06:19,507 --> 00:06:22,710
<i>- Done.
- Alex: See? That's why I let him keep me.</i>

139
00:06:22,744 --> 00:06:25,446
- His brain turns me on.
- I thought it was my body.

140

Yeah, I've got to go win over my director.

You have a couple minutes.

150
00:06:56,978 --> 00:07:00,114
I'm exhausted. I'm not sure we'd
accomplish much in a couple minutes.

151

00:07:50,131 --> 00:07:52,466
- You don't look ready.
- Why not?

169
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,668
- You look tired.
- I do?

170
00:07:54,702 --> 00:07:56,703
Yeah, and you smell.

171
00:07:56,738 --> 00:07:59,039
Or maybe I smell. I sweat when I meditate.

172
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:02,443
Vince, you okay?

173
00:08:02,477 --> 00:08:04,144
Yeah.

174
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:07,347
Took a Vicodin last night.
It knocked me out good.

175
00:08:07,382 --> 00:08:09,550
Guess I'm still not awake.

176
00:08:09,584 --> 00:08:11,685
Okay.

177
00:08:17,058 --> 00:08:19,626
I'm gonna wash my face,

178
00:08:19,661 --> 00:08:21,962
grab a cup of coffee.

179
00:08:21,996 --> 00:08:23,831
Yeah, maybe grab a few, huh?

180
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,970
- Lizzie.
- Are you kidding?

181
00:08:30,004 --> 00:08:32,606
This time I confess I am following you.

182
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,575
- Why?
- I feel bad.

183
00:08:34,609 --> 00:08:37,611
I heard that things aren't working out
too well for you over at Amanda's.

184
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:40,814
- Where'd you hear that?
- I have ears everywhere.

185
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:43,350
- It has nothing to do with you.
- I haven't slept in two days.

186
00:08:43,384 --> 00:08:46,086
That has everything to do with you.

187
00:08:46,121 --> 00:08:47,454
I can't help you sleep, Ari.

188
00:08:47,489 --> 00:08:50,257
I need those tapes back.

189
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:51,925
"Deadline hollywood" has them.

190
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,293
No they don't.

191
00:08:55,196 --> 00:08:57,297
Ari, why didn't you promote me?

192
00:08:57,332 --> 00:09:00,000
- Honestly.
- Honestly?

193
00:09:00,034 --> 00:09:03,770
My wife wanted me to get rid of you.

194
00:09:03,805 --> 00:09:05,539
( Chuckles )

195
00:09:05,573 --> 00:09:08,709
Wow, okay. That's a lot more honest
than I expected.

196
00:09:08,743 --> 00:09:12,045
Not to mention I wouldn't peg you
as the type to bend to your wife's demands.

197
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,480
Well, you would be surprised.

198
00:09:13,515 --> 00:09:17,050
She wanted you gone long before
you asked for that promotion.

199
00:09:17,085 --> 00:09:19,953
- Then you quit and I didn't
have to do anything.
- What if I hadn't?

200
00:09:19,988 --> 00:09:22,623
I still wouldn't have promoted you
'cause you weren't ready.

201
00:09:22,657 --> 00:09:25,125
Someday you will be, but not yet.

202
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,629
- Honestly.
- I still disagree.

203
00:09:28,663 --> 00:09:31,465
Do you also disagree

204
00:09:31,499 --> 00:09:35,402
that had I given it to you, other people,
not just my wife,

205
00:09:35,436 --> 00:09:37,104
would have made excuses as to why

206
00:09:37,138 --> 00:09:39,640
and you wouldn't be
recognized for your work?

207
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:42,042
That is such a bullshit double standard.

208
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:44,912
I don't make the rules.
Not all of 'em anyway.

209
00:09:44,946 --> 00:09:48,282
You know, I actually respect that
you're still standing your ground.

210
00:09:48,316 --> 00:09:51,318
Well, let's call a truce. Move on.

211
00:09:51,352 --> 00:09:53,887
Yeah, I would if I had
somewhere to move on to.

212
00:09:53,922 --> 00:09:55,355
Well, come back to me.

213
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,524
Yeah, with my tail between my legs.

214
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,426
Then for sure no one would respect me.

215
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,262
You can find a job. Something better.

216
00:10:02,297 --> 00:10:05,599
- Maybe you can help me find that.
- How?

217
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:07,935
Ari, come on, you control this town.

218
00:10:07,969 --> 00:10:09,703
If you believe in me, help me.

219
00:10:09,737 --> 00:10:11,738
Being an agent was just a means to an end.

220
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:13,373
I would love a studio job.

221
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:16,043
- I'll make some calls.
- Do more than that.

222
00:10:16,077 --> 00:10:17,477
I need those tapes, Lizzie.

223
00:10:17,512 --> 00:10:20,047
I don't know what's on them.
All right, I talk a lot.

224
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:22,816
I'm mean with words.
My actions usually aren't.

225
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,818
If they're as bad as I've played them
in my head...

226
00:10:24,852 --> 00:10:28,088
- They're worse.
- That could be a real problem for my family.

227
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:30,791
- And for the N.F.L.
- The N.F.L. will be done, of course.

228
00:10:30,825 --> 00:10:33,193
And you know how much I want that.

229
00:10:33,228 --> 00:10:35,729
But that will be nothing compared

230
00:10:35,763 --> 00:10:40,000
to what I think might happen
with my wife and kids.

231
00:10:40,034 --> 00:10:42,202
Show some compassion.

232
00:10:42,237 --> 00:10:45,572
I already have, Ari.

233
00:10:45,607 --> 00:10:47,741
This whole thing was Amanda's idea...

234
00:10:47,775 --> 00:10:51,411
To sue, now this.

235
00:10:51,446 --> 00:10:54,081
That's why I'm not gonna
be working with her anymore.

236
00:10:54,115 --> 00:10:56,250
I appreciate that.

237
00:10:56,284 --> 00:10:58,719
I would appreciate a job.

238
00:10:58,753 --> 00:11:01,989
If you were gonna send the tapes
you would have sent them already.

239
00:11:02,023 --> 00:11:05,359
Who knows, maybe five years from now
I might be going through a nasty divorce

240
00:11:05,393 --> 00:11:07,728
and I might displace my anger
at all men towards you.

241
00:11:07,762 --> 00:11:10,897
- I will find you a job.
- I'll get you those tapes.

242
00:11:10,932 --> 00:11:12,733
We could have been good together.

243
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,202
We were good together.

244
00:11:22,143 --> 00:11:24,378
I think the bottle needs to be updated.

245
00:11:24,412 --> 00:11:26,780
- The bottle?
- The label feels dated to me.

246
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:30,484
I'm about to give you mid-morning sex
and you're thinking about labels?

247
00:11:30,518 --> 00:11:32,586
My mind can't stop.
I've got a million ideas

248
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,288
on how I can make this company really pop.

249
00:11:34,322 --> 00:11:35,956
You know what 50 cent told me?

250
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,226
He made 50 mil in music
and 150 mil in vitamin water.

251
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,594
Maybe we can make that.

252
00:11:40,628 --> 00:11:42,796
I'd just like to be able to pay my rent.

253
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,564
You got to dream big.

254
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:46,700
<i>( Phone rings )</i>

255
00:11:46,734 --> 00:11:48,535
- It's Carlos.
- May I?

256
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:50,037
Yeah.

257
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:51,838
Hey hey, Carlos. Quick question:

258
00:11:51,873 --> 00:11:54,741
<i>- What do you think about updating the bottle?
- What do you mean?</i>

259
00:11:54,776 --> 00:11:56,310
It feels a little dated to me.

260
00:11:56,344 --> 00:11:57,978
Turtle, slow down.

261
00:11:58,012 --> 00:12:00,247
The bottle is a cool shape, I'll admit that.

262
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:02,482
But I've promoted clubs and I've bartended

263
00:12:02,517 --> 00:12:04,518
and the simple fact is you need a bottle

264
00:12:04,552 --> 00:12:06,386
that's easy to grip and ours isn't that easy.

265
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:08,255
We'll talk about it when
I come up later this week.

266
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:10,590
<i>- Why are you coming up?
- So we can talk.</i>

267
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,192
About what?

268
00:12:12,226 --> 00:12:13,960
Well, first off I can't get you 50 cases

269
00:12:13,995 --> 00:12:16,763
for this Gil Turner's. Not by tonight.

270
00:12:16,798 --> 00:12:19,066
- Why not?
- 'Cause I don't have that many in L.A.

271
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,867
You said whenever I need supply

272
00:12:20,902 --> 00:12:22,969
to call and you could
have 'em to me in an hour.

273
00:12:23,004 --> 00:12:24,971
<i>I meant for friends or for a party,</i>

274
00:12:25,006 --> 00:12:26,907
not so you could sell.
That's not your job.

275
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:29,276
<i>I gave you stock
in this company to get Vince</i>

276
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,244
to do an ad campaign,
not so you could be my salesman.

277
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,413
Jesus, I already put onvincs

278
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:35,315
will be there tonight.
You're gonna make me look bad.

279
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,817
Stop doing things on your own.

280
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:39,086
You're going to make yourself look bad.

281
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,421
- Carlos...
- Turtle, I'll be there on Friday.

282
00:12:41,456 --> 00:12:42,723
We'll talk.

283
00:12:42,757 --> 00:12:45,826
He says he can't get me
the cases we need.

284
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,495
So call gil's and tell him.
He'll understand.

285
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:51,098
He'll understand that I don't deliver
when I promised to

286
00:12:51,132 --> 00:12:53,166
and more importantly when Vince promises to.

287
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:54,701
How many cases do we have left here?

288
00:12:54,736 --> 00:12:56,570
- Eight maybe.
- Eight.

289
00:12:56,604 --> 00:12:58,472
- I can find the rest.
- How?

290
00:12:58,506 --> 00:13:00,307
I've just got to make some calls.

291
00:13:03,144 --> 00:13:05,345
So how are you, Vince?

292
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,049
I'm good, I'm good. I just want to say
I'm sorry about our last meeting.

293
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,885
Bringing a date obviouslywasn't
the most professional thing to do.

294
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:13,553
I'm sorry.

295
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:16,757
I was more concerned with the fact
that I thought you were drunk.

296
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,759
I wasn't.

297
00:13:18,793 --> 00:13:20,827
One glass of tequila.

298
00:13:20,862 --> 00:13:22,863
And you're tweeting about tequila now.

299
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:24,664
You really like the stuff, huh?

300
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:26,433
It's a company my friend got me into.

301
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:29,269
But don't worry, no more tweets about it.

302
00:13:29,303 --> 00:13:31,805
My fingers are sealed.
( Chuckles )

303
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,208
You know, my lips are sealed
but you tweet with your fingers.

304
00:13:35,243 --> 00:13:37,177
Oh, that's funny.

305
00:13:37,211 --> 00:13:39,813
So, Vince, here's why I wanted
to have this meeting.

306
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:43,250
Obviously, as you know, your
commitment to do "Air-walker"

307
00:13:43,284 --> 00:13:46,153
is what gave the studio the
confidence to greenlight the movie.

308
00:13:46,187 --> 00:13:48,555
- And your directing.
- Well, thank you.

309
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:50,824
Hopefully that had a little something
to do with it.

310
00:13:50,858 --> 00:13:52,359
But here's the deal.

311
00:13:52,393 --> 00:13:55,562
If we're gonna go spend more
than a year of our lives together,

312
00:13:55,596 --> 00:13:57,964
I need to know that I can count on you.

313
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:00,467
<i>- You can.
- I need to know</i>

314
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:03,069
that everything about you
and your personal life

315
00:14:03,104 --> 00:14:06,740
- is in control and in order.
- It is.

316
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:10,911
It is.

317
00:14:10,945 --> 00:14:13,947
Because I've known you for
so long I feel superconfident

318
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:16,383
that I can tailor a character
around your voice.

319
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:18,285
And I have the perfect character.

320
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:20,554
I'm ready, Billy. Show me what you got.

321
00:14:23,324 --> 00:14:26,660
- What the hell is that?
- I mentioned something
about this to you earlier

322
00:14:26,694 --> 00:14:29,930
- and I think you thought I was joking,
but I wasn't.
- What is it?

323
00:14:29,964 --> 00:14:32,365
- It's you, Johnny.
- I don't follow.

324
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,967
<i>- Did you draw that?
- Yeah.</i>

325
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:35,402
- It's pretty good.
- Thanks.

326
00:14:35,436 --> 00:14:38,004
- What does that have to do with me?
- It is you, Drama.

327
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:40,240
You're a high-strung simian
trying to make it

328
00:14:40,274 --> 00:14:42,309
in a human world that just doesn't get you.

329
00:14:42,343 --> 00:14:44,144
<i>- Is this some kind of joke?
- No, it's not a joke.</i>

330
00:14:44,178 --> 00:14:46,179
- Here, say something.
- Say something?

331
00:14:46,214 --> 00:14:47,848
<i>Yeah, hold this up here and say something.</i>

332
00:14:47,882 --> 00:14:50,851
- Get that out of my face, bro.
- See? His voice is perfect.

333
00:14:50,885 --> 00:14:52,719
You want me to voice a mean gorilla?

334
00:14:52,753 --> 00:14:54,921
No, he's not mean. He's misunderstood.

335
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:56,857
Like you, he's named Johnny.

336
00:14:56,891 --> 00:15:00,560
We call it "Johnny's bananas."

337
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:02,262
- ( Laughs )
- That's not funny.

338
00:15:02,296 --> 00:15:04,331
It made me laugh. Can you write a script?

339
00:15:04,365 --> 00:15:06,066
I already did an outline
while I was meditating.

340
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,601
I just have to transcribe it to paper.

341
00:15:07,635 --> 00:15:09,102
Great, what's it say?
Can you pitch it to us?

342
00:15:09,136 --> 00:15:11,938
Okay, so Johnny's ex-wife is a nasty

343
00:15:11,973 --> 00:15:14,407
little black widow
spider monkey named Julie.

344
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:19,346
She's getting remarried
to a baboon named Ronald.

345
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,882
It's a big ceremony.
It's the talk of the town.

346
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,150
But when Johnny stops paying alimony

347
00:15:24,185 --> 00:15:26,186
she tells him it was only a love ceremony;

348
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,256
that it's not legally binding
and that she's taking him to court.

349
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:32,425
And then Johnny goes bananas.

350
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,628
( Laughing )
Tell me what happens.

351
00:15:34,662 --> 00:15:36,329
- Does he win?
- You'll have to read it.

352
00:15:36,364 --> 00:15:39,533
Who cares if he wins?
And I'm not reading it 'cause I lose.

353
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:43,703
Are you making fun of me, Billy?
Is that what you're doing?

354
00:15:43,738 --> 00:15:45,605
No, Drama, I'm obsessed with animation.

355
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,708
You ever see "Family guy"?
That dog Brian, he kills me.

356
00:15:48,743 --> 00:15:50,410
He kind of is me. Was me.

357
00:15:50,444 --> 00:15:53,313
I mean, this stuff moves people.

358
00:15:53,347 --> 00:15:55,448
And just imagine how your plight

359
00:15:55,483 --> 00:15:59,219
as a misunderstood gorilla
can move countless angry men.

360
00:15:59,253 --> 00:16:01,488
I'm starting to get angry now!

361
00:16:01,522 --> 00:16:04,391
This is my first shot at my own show

362
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:07,827
and you want me to hide behind a cartoon
monkey. And you're liking this?

363
00:16:07,862 --> 00:16:10,597
- I'm intrigued.
- Well, I'm not intrigued!

364
00:16:10,631 --> 00:16:13,366
Not even a little bit.
What a waste of my day.

365
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:15,502
Drama!

366
00:16:15,536 --> 00:16:18,038
( Grunting )

367
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:21,474
- What are you doing, Billy?
- That's what Johnny will do when he gets angry.

368
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:24,377
- You like it, right?
- I'm intrigued.

369
00:16:24,412 --> 00:16:25,645
( Grunts )

370
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,747
Mark, I don't want you
to take this personally.

371
00:16:27,782 --> 00:16:29,282
Take what personally?

372
00:16:29,317 --> 00:16:31,318
You know those cases
of tequila Vince sent over to you?

373
00:16:31,352 --> 00:16:33,119
<i>- Yeah.
- We need 'em back.</i>

374
00:16:33,154 --> 00:16:35,021
<i>- What?
- No no, I'm serious.</i>

375
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:36,656
We're calling everybody we gave 'em to.

376
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:38,892
What's there a botulism
recall on 'em or something?

377
00:16:38,926 --> 00:16:41,328
No, nothing like that.
We have a buyer

378
00:16:41,362 --> 00:16:43,563
that I promised to deliver to
but I can't get any in time.

379
00:16:43,598 --> 00:16:46,232
<i>At kind of rinky-dink shit
did you get Vince involved with?</i>

380
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:48,201
I told you invest
in the water company, dude.

381
00:16:48,235 --> 00:16:51,271
- Aquahydrate is blowing up.
- I know, I see it everywhere.

382
00:16:51,305 --> 00:16:53,773
Hey, Vinnie Chase is doing
a recall on his free Tequila.

383
00:16:53,808 --> 00:16:55,775
- Let me speak to him.
- Did you give diddy some?

384
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,712
You're in trouble.
He's here, hold on. It's Turtle.

385
00:16:58,746 --> 00:17:01,348
Hey, Turtle, I told you
you should have had Vinnie

386
00:17:01,382 --> 00:17:03,183
invest in Ciroc when I told you about it.

387
00:17:03,217 --> 00:17:05,218
<i>It's not too late though, Turtle.</i>

388
00:17:05,252 --> 00:17:08,855
- Doesn't sound like you're
doing too good with tequila.
- ( Laughs )

389
00:17:08,889 --> 00:17:11,524
Call Rob Baldwin, have him
pick it up at the house.

390
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:14,928
But I want my water back, all right?
Don't call me no more.

391
00:17:14,962 --> 00:17:17,097
- Oh, 23 cases.
- Great.

392
00:17:17,131 --> 00:17:19,065
- Yup.
- Who else did you give 'em to?

393
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,900
I sent 10 over to James Cameron.

394
00:17:20,935 --> 00:17:23,503
- Can you call him?
- Mmm, no.

395
00:17:23,537 --> 00:17:25,271
It's the Terminator.

396
00:17:25,306 --> 00:17:27,841
Why do I have to give this girl a job?

397
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:30,343
Because I am asking you to
and because you can.

398
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:32,912
- And you think she'd be good for me?
- I know she would.

399
00:17:32,947 --> 00:17:35,682
- But she wasn't good enough for you.
- She was great for me.

400
00:17:35,716 --> 00:17:38,218
- But you fired her.
- I didn't fire her, she quit.

401
00:17:38,252 --> 00:17:40,520
- What is going on here?
- I need a favor.

402
00:17:40,554 --> 00:17:42,589
- I got...
- Thanks.

403
00:17:42,623 --> 00:17:44,824
I got you your job, all right?

404
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:46,660
So this is the least you can do for me.

405
00:17:46,694 --> 00:17:49,496
What do you owe her, though?
Did you fuck her or something?

406
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,632
What is the matter with you? You were
the last person I was with before my wife.

407
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:55,635
- No one since.
- Wow, that was over 20 years ago.

408
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,038
You're actually one of the good guys,

409
00:17:58,072 --> 00:17:59,439
despite what they say.

410
00:17:59,473 --> 00:18:02,809
I need this, Dana,
or those naysayers may be proven right.

411
00:18:02,843 --> 00:18:04,611
What does she have on you?

412
00:18:04,645 --> 00:18:06,746
She is a star. That's all that matters.

413
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:09,849
She's a tv agent. And what,
you think that she can run a studio?

414
00:18:09,884 --> 00:18:12,786
I was a tv agent.
They offered me the job to run this studio.

415
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,954
The job that I gave you. I need a favor.

416
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:17,424
- Fine, I will meet her.
- Great.

417
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:20,026
<i>- But I need a favor as well.
- Anything.</i>

418
00:18:20,061 --> 00:18:22,462
I want a baby.

419
00:18:22,496 --> 00:18:23,897
What?

420
00:18:23,931 --> 00:18:25,965
<i>I'm pushing 40, I don't have a man.</i>

421
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,035
I want a baby with your sperm.

422
00:18:30,771 --> 00:18:32,706
Seriously?

423
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,608
( Laughs )
No, I'm just fucking with you.

424
00:18:35,643 --> 00:18:38,378
- ( Laughs )
- I need sperm with thicker hair.

425
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:41,081
- Ah, so what do you need?
- Lenny kravitz.

426
00:18:41,115 --> 00:18:43,683
- For what?
- You know Jim Enders, director?

427
00:18:43,718 --> 00:18:46,319
- The gay guy that won Sundance.
- He's not gay.

428
00:18:46,353 --> 00:18:49,255
- Come on.
- He's not gay, but even if he was...

429
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,724
Okay, so what do you need?

430
00:18:50,758 --> 00:18:53,093
- I dated him.
- Okay, he's not gay!

431
00:18:53,127 --> 00:18:55,829
And he's directing "True Violet."

432
00:18:55,863 --> 00:18:58,498
- What, the one with Russell Crowe?
- And Charlize.

433
00:18:58,532 --> 00:19:00,500
- I didn't know that.
- It just happened.

434
00:19:00,534 --> 00:19:02,669
So he wants Lenny to play a small part

435
00:19:02,703 --> 00:19:05,338
that he thinks can steal the movie.
He's desperate.

436
00:19:05,372 --> 00:19:06,840
You know I put Lenny in "Precious"?

437
00:19:06,874 --> 00:19:08,408
- That's why I'm asking.
- Done.

438
00:19:08,442 --> 00:19:11,511
Done, done, done.

439
00:19:11,545 --> 00:19:14,981
- Then done.
- I love you, Dana.

440
00:19:15,015 --> 00:19:17,350
And if I ever cheat on my wife
it will be you I'm fucking.

441
00:19:17,384 --> 00:19:19,552
( Chuckles )
I look forward to it.

442
00:19:19,587 --> 00:19:21,121
It's Randall Wallace calling.

443
00:19:21,155 --> 00:19:23,656
Oh, great. Thanks.
This is about the Vince meeting.

444
00:19:25,693 --> 00:19:27,393
Hello, Randall.

445
00:19:27,428 --> 00:19:29,429
How did it go?

446
00:19:29,463 --> 00:19:32,799
<i>- Well, that's good to hear.
- Vince: Yeah, Randall's a really good guy.</i>

447
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,068
<i>- I think we're gonna have
a lot of fun on this one.
- Great.</i>

448
00:19:35,102 --> 00:19:36,503
What are you up to for the rest of the day?

449
00:19:36,537 --> 00:19:38,371
Sasha and I are gonna grab a bite to eat.

450
00:19:38,405 --> 00:19:40,440
<i>- All right, enjoy.
- Always.</i>

451
00:19:40,474 --> 00:19:42,442
I'll talk to you later.

452
00:19:42,476 --> 00:19:45,245
- He said the meeting with Randall went great.
- Why wouldn't it?

453
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,313
Now we just got to deal
with the other Chase brother.

454
00:19:47,348 --> 00:19:49,482
I think this actually could be pretty funny.

455
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:51,818
Billy: Pretty funny? With Drama it'll kill.

456
00:19:51,852 --> 00:19:53,253
It literally looks like him.

457
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:54,988
Billy, I didn't know you were still here.

458
00:19:55,022 --> 00:19:57,891
Well, Drama drove me and then left,
so where else would I be?

459
00:19:57,925 --> 00:20:01,461
Hey, I wrote up that one pager if you want
to send it over to your guy at the studio.

460
00:20:01,495 --> 00:20:03,463
I think we should probably
get Drama onboard first.

461
00:20:03,497 --> 00:20:05,598
I think if the studio likes it he'll jump.

462
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:08,268
- You're probably right.
- Ari's calling for you.

463
00:20:08,302 --> 00:20:10,637
Great.

464
00:20:10,671 --> 00:20:11,871
Hey, what's up?

465
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:13,773
<i>What the fuck is going on?!</i>

466
00:20:13,808 --> 00:20:16,042
Hello to you too.
What's your fucking problem?

467
00:20:16,076 --> 00:20:19,512
My problem is that Wallace
is not happy about his meeting with Vince.

468
00:20:19,547 --> 00:20:21,548
I just spoke to Vince.
He said the meeting went great.

469
00:20:21,582 --> 00:20:23,917
- Did he?
- Yeah, why? What did Randall say?

470
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:26,119
He said he thought Vince was on coke.

471
00:20:26,153 --> 00:20:28,321
<i>- What?
- That's what he said.</i>

472
00:20:28,355 --> 00:20:30,723
<i>- I hope you told him he wasn't.
- Eric.</i>

473
00:20:30,758 --> 00:20:32,458
Ari, I've known Vince for 30 years.

474
00:20:32,493 --> 00:20:34,194
He's never done coke a day in his life.

475
00:20:34,228 --> 00:20:36,262
<i>Whether he has or hasn't,</i>

476
00:20:36,297 --> 00:20:39,132
Wallace's impression of him was not good.

477
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:40,800
What's the studio's impression of him?

478
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:42,435
I'm waiting to hear back from Dana on that.

479
00:20:42,469 --> 00:20:44,938
<i>- I'm gonna call Vince.
- I've left word for him already.</i>

480
00:20:44,972 --> 00:20:48,641
- Let me know if you hear from him.
- I'll talk to you later.

481
00:20:48,676 --> 00:20:51,578
- What was that?
- Randall thinks Vince was on coke
at the meeting.

482
00:20:51,612 --> 00:20:54,314
- Come on.
- I know, right?

483
00:20:54,348 --> 00:20:56,449
Maybe I should call Randall.

484
00:20:56,483 --> 00:20:58,852
Maybe you should call Vince first.

485
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:02,488
I don't even know why
I sent Pauly Shore bottles,

486
00:21:02,523 --> 00:21:04,591
but that jerkoff should
have just sent them back.

487
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,926
You've got 40 cases.
I'm sure it's gonna be fine.

488
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:09,329
I don't think so.

489
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:16,769
- I'm sorry I couldn't get you more, Randy.
- Yeah, me too. It's crazy.

490
00:21:16,804 --> 00:21:18,638
Everyone wants the first bottles
sold in the States.

491
00:21:18,672 --> 00:21:20,240
I'm gonna get you more
as soon as possible.

492
00:21:20,274 --> 00:21:22,075
Any idea when that would be?

493
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:24,477
Sitting down with the big boss this week.
I'll find out.

494
00:21:24,511 --> 00:21:26,980
Well, if they like the taste you might
have yourself a winner.

495
00:21:27,014 --> 00:21:29,249
Oh, they'll love the taste.
And I'm sure we have a winner.

496
00:21:29,283 --> 00:21:32,118
- All right, thanks again.
- Take care, man.

497
00:21:32,152 --> 00:21:34,487
- Who are you calling?
- The press;

498
00:21:34,521 --> 00:21:36,756
create a little buzz.

499
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:41,027
Hey, Turtle, yo.
Is Vince coming down for this?

500
00:21:41,061 --> 00:21:42,996
I don't know if he's gonna
have a chance to stop by,

501
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,164
but you guys should buy a bottle
of this stuff if you can get one.

502
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:47,800
- Yeah? You think it's that good?
- I know it is, Yori.

503
00:21:47,835 --> 00:21:49,602
- All right, thanks.
- Oh, use that piece,

504
00:21:49,637 --> 00:21:51,537
and I'll let you know where Vince
is next time we go out.

505
00:21:51,572 --> 00:21:53,706
- Done.
- Later.

506
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:56,309
I got a good feeling you're gonna
be able to pay your rent.

507
00:21:58,112 --> 00:22:00,580
Lenny, it's a no-brainer.

508
00:22:00,614 --> 00:22:02,849
<i>- A no-brainer for who, Ari?
- For you.</i>

509
00:22:02,883 --> 00:22:05,385
Two scenes with Russell Crowe,
are you kidding me?

510
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:08,788
- Did you read the scenes?
- I don't need to read them.

511
00:22:08,822 --> 00:22:11,557
<i>The director's passion
for you is unmistakable.</i>

512
00:22:11,592 --> 00:22:13,026
He's an up-and-comer.

513
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,528
If you want this acting thing
to become more than a hobby,

514
00:22:15,562 --> 00:22:17,497
then you step up and do this. Trust me.

515
00:22:17,531 --> 00:22:19,065
- Read the scenes.
- Why?

516
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:22,201
Because there's no dialogue, Ari.
I'm shirtless with a guitar.

517
00:22:22,236 --> 00:22:24,404
I think the director wants to fuck me.

518
00:22:24,438 --> 00:22:26,172
Lenny, he dated a girlfriend of mine.

519
00:22:26,206 --> 00:22:28,908
Look, I can turn the best of the
either way, I'm not doing it.

520
00:22:28,943 --> 00:22:30,677
<i>- Lenny!
- I've got to go. I'm in temple.</i>

521
00:22:30,711 --> 00:22:32,245
It's my niece's Bat Mitzvah Saturday

522
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:34,047
and I've got to help
her get her voice right.

523
00:22:34,081 --> 00:22:37,083
( Speaks hebrew )

524
00:22:37,117 --> 00:22:40,053
All right, man.
Hey, Ari, I've got to go.

525
00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:43,823
Lizzie Grant's waiting.

526
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,294
Thank you for running over.

527
00:22:48,329 --> 00:22:49,762
You really delivered that fast.

528
00:22:49,797 --> 00:22:52,231
I thought that I did when I called.

529
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:55,868
And I still think that
I will, but I haven't yet.

530
00:22:55,903 --> 00:22:57,670
Oh.

531
00:22:57,705 --> 00:22:59,205
I'm sorry.

532
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:01,541
I am as well.

533
00:23:01,575 --> 00:23:03,443
Do what you can.

534
00:23:03,477 --> 00:23:04,911
Really?

535
00:23:07,648 --> 00:23:09,649
I don't want to blackmail my way into a job.

536
00:23:09,683 --> 00:23:11,985
This whole thing is starting
to eat away at my insides.

537
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:15,254
Nothing but respect from here on out.

538
00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:17,256
Thanks, Ari.

539
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:19,258
Good luck.

540
00:23:19,293 --> 00:23:22,028
( Laughs )

541
00:23:27,334 --> 00:23:29,168
Did you ever make it on
with the N.F.L. people?

542
00:23:29,203 --> 00:23:32,572
Oh no. Get my new partners on the phone.

543
00:23:32,606 --> 00:23:35,108
( Laughs )

544
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,881
- Are you okay?
- More than okay, Babs.

545
00:23:41,915 --> 00:23:44,083
More than okay. Lizzie gave me the tapes.

546
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:47,720
- That's great, but... but...
- But what?

547
00:23:47,755 --> 00:23:50,223
Did you not see "Deadline Hollywood"?

548
00:23:50,257 --> 00:23:51,791
No.

549
00:23:51,825 --> 00:23:54,794
Somebody told Anna Fowler
what was on the tapes.

550
00:23:54,828 --> 00:23:56,696
<i>- Amanda?
- I don't know.</i>

551
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,831
But it's bad.

552
00:23:58,866 --> 00:24:01,234
I'm sorry, Ari.

553
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:12,145
<i>Jake: I've got Jerry Jones
and your wife both calling.</i>

554
00:24:12,212 --> 00:24:15,081
<i>Ari?</i>

555
00:24:15,115 --> 00:24:17,083
Ari?

556
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:21,387
Jerry Jones.

557
00:24:21,422 --> 00:24:24,624
( Growls )

558
00:24:24,658 --> 00:24:27,126
( Rings )

559
00:24:27,161 --> 00:24:29,629
( Exhales )

560
00:24:29,663 --> 00:24:32,031
Jerry, how are you?

561
00:24:32,066 --> 00:24:33,800
Better than you, it seems.

562
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:35,868
I've just gotten off the phone
with our publicist.

563
00:24:35,903 --> 00:24:38,237
It's all lies and rumors, my friend.

564
00:24:38,272 --> 00:24:39,806
Listen, I can clean it all up.

565
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,240
It doesn't matter.

566
00:24:41,275 --> 00:24:43,543
I don't do scandal.
The N.F.L. doesn't do scandal.

567
00:24:43,577 --> 00:24:46,079
<i>It's too bad. We were excited about this.</i>

568
00:24:46,113 --> 00:24:49,148
- So was I.
- Good luck with this thing.

569
00:24:50,684 --> 00:24:52,552
Thank you.

570
00:24:54,221 --> 00:24:56,422
You wife's still on hold.
Should I put her through?

571
00:24:56,457 --> 00:24:58,891
- ( Phones ringing )
- Jeez, your phone's blowing up.

572
00:24:58,926 --> 00:25:00,793
Something's going on.

573
00:25:03,397 --> 00:25:04,897
Oh my God.

574
00:25:04,932 --> 00:25:07,767
His wife must be freaking out.

575
00:25:07,801 --> 00:25:09,235
Yeah, I'm sure.

576
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:11,437
What would you say if you
read that stuff about me?

577
00:25:11,472 --> 00:25:13,172
I don't know.

578
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:15,308
Is there even a chance that could happen?

579
00:25:15,342 --> 00:25:17,176
( Laughs )
I don't think so, no.

580
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:19,145
<i>( Phone rings )</i>

581
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:21,647
It's Vince, finally.
Vince, where the hell have you been?

582
00:25:21,682 --> 00:25:24,484
We decided to drive up the coast.
We didn't have any service.

583
00:25:24,518 --> 00:25:27,420
<i>- We've got a problem.
- What now?</i>

584
00:25:27,454 --> 00:25:29,422
Wallace thinks you were
on coke at the meeting.

585
00:25:29,456 --> 00:25:31,090
<i>- What?
- Yeah, Dana's freaking out.</i>

586
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:33,292
<i>- He told that to the studio?
- Yes.</i>

587
00:25:33,327 --> 00:25:35,394
And what did you say?

588
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:36,963
Ari told me, I told him no way.

589
00:25:36,997 --> 00:25:38,698
Well, I hope Ari sets them straight.

590
00:25:38,732 --> 00:25:41,067
- He's got his own problems right now, Vince.
- Oh, really?

591
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:44,203
<i>- Vince, you said the meeting went great.
- I thought it did.</i>

592
00:25:44,238 --> 00:25:46,772
I mean, maybe I was a little nervous.

593
00:25:46,807 --> 00:25:49,208
<i>And I was tired so I drank a lot of coffee.</i>

594
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:52,745
I can't believe he called the studio
without telling me right to my face.

595
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:54,881
I'll call Dana and tell her
I've known you 30 years;

596
00:25:54,915 --> 00:25:58,084
- I've never seen you do coke.
- Okay.

597
00:25:58,118 --> 00:25:59,986
Thanks.

598
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,721
I'm sure it'll be fine.

599
00:26:01,755 --> 00:26:03,789
<i>- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

600
00:26:03,824 --> 00:26:06,325
Look, E, I'll see you on Monday.

601
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,729
- All will be well.
- Okay, I'll talk to you later.

602
00:26:09,763 --> 00:26:12,932
- You're bad.
- Why?

603
00:26:12,966 --> 00:26:14,901
You totally just lied to him.

604
00:26:14,935 --> 00:26:17,737
