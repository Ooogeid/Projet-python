1
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:22,031
- I'm not calling her again.
- I wouldn't.

2
00:01:22,156 --> 00:01:24,138
What could I have possibly
done wrong this time ?

3
00:01:24,263 --> 00:01:26,673
- You won't know unless you call.
- So you think I should call ?

4
00:01:26,798 --> 00:01:29,676
- If you want to know what you did wrong.
- All right, I'll call.

5
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:32,646
I'm not calling because
I didn't do anything.

6
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:35,417
- Good for you, taking a stand,
- a stand against what ?

7
00:01:35,542 --> 00:01:38,509
A stand against women who get mad at
us when we haven't even done anything.

8
00:01:38,634 --> 00:01:41,195
-When have you had that, turtle ?
-I've had everything you've had.

9
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,852
Jamie mad at you about something ?

10
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,870
No, but she did get
weird when I told her

11
00:01:44,995 --> 00:01:47,267
About the sorority girls
rolling around in my underwear.

12
00:01:47,392 --> 00:01:49,066
- What did she say ?
- Nothing much.

13
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:51,198
Just that she's driving
me to school from now on.

14
00:01:51,323 --> 00:01:53,406
- Ooh, that make you nervous ?
- No, why should it ?

15
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:55,669
Maybe'cause you're still
thinking about that one girl.

16
00:01:55,794 --> 00:01:58,405
- Thinking about her ?
- Yeah, like you want to bang her.

17
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,340
Stop. I have a girlfriend.

18
00:02:00,465 --> 00:02:02,110
Oh, so you don't want to bang her ?

19
00:02:02,235 --> 00:02:04,812
I don't even want to thi about
banging her'cause I have a girlfriend.

20
00:02:04,937 --> 00:02:06,613
Good for you, turtle.

21
00:02:06,738 --> 00:02:08,339
Why, you think I should bang her ?

22
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,953
But it would be normal
if you did think about it.

23
00:02:12,078 --> 00:02:14,780
I am thinking about it.
I feel very guilty.

24
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:18,262
Yo, johnny. What's up ?

25
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,230
- How was work ?
- Awful.

26
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:23,146
Stacy, can I get another
one of these, please ?

27
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:25,249
- Amstel.
- I'll have one of those too.

28
00:02:25,374 --> 00:02:26,730
- Okay, turtle ?
- Driving.

29
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,148
- All right.
- What happened ?

30
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,095
Apparently the facial lacerations

31
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,035
that coakley made
them give me are infected

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,418
and my character's got staph or something.

33
00:02:36,543 --> 00:02:38,621
In tonight's scene,
my speech was slurred

34
00:02:38,746 --> 00:02:40,728
So they had to rush
me to the hospital.

35
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:44,121
I think my character's
heading for a coma.

36
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,414
Jesus.

37
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:47,775
I can't take much more of this.

38
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,711
At least you're still
getting a paycheck.

39
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,121
I didn't get into this
business for a paycheck, turtle.

40
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:55,142
I got into this business so that
the world could see my talent.

41
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,383
Oh, christ.
This just ain't my night.

42
00:02:59,508 --> 00:03:01,848
- What happened ?
- See the guy who just walked in over there ?

43
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,391
- Don't look !
- You said, "see the guy over there ?"

44
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:06,769
- Now I'm telling you don't look at him.
- Who is he ?

45
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,355
It's the producer that fired
me from "melrose place."

46
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,731
God, don't see me.

47
00:03:10,986 --> 00:03:13,036
Hold on a second. Johnny chase.

48
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:16,737
- Johnny chase.
- Hey, phil yagota.

49
00:03:16,942 --> 00:03:20,087
- How the hell are you ?
- What's going on, man ? I'm good.

50
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:21,562
Been a long time.

51
00:03:22,477 --> 00:03:25,360
This is my brother vince,
turtle and eric.

52
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:27,341
- Hey, guys. Big fan.
- Thanks.

53
00:03:27,743 --> 00:03:29,614
So how're you doing ?
Show's doing great ?

54
00:03:31,235 --> 00:03:32,358
Loving it there.

55
00:03:32,483 --> 00:03:35,018
It's just one of the great
working experiences of my life.

56
00:03:35,143 --> 00:03:37,361
- Beautiful.
- No offense.

57
00:03:37,396 --> 00:03:39,811
None taken, man. We had some
good times back in the day.

58
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:44,181
It did take me to crazy girls after you canned me.

59
00:03:45,615 --> 00:03:48,276
I didn't can you.
Higher ups than me did.

60
00:03:49,454 --> 00:03:51,566
I can't believe you're sitting here, man.

61
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:53,983
I literally was just
thinking about you.

62
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,201
Yeah, Why ?

63
00:03:55,326 --> 00:03:57,842
Well, we're gearing up
to do "melrose" 2009

64
00:03:57,967 --> 00:03:58,967
And...

65
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:02,575
There's a part you're perfect for.

66
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,040
Really ?

67
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:07,788
You would work with me again ?

68
00:04:09,644 --> 00:04:12,623
In a second, man,
if you were available.

69
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,882
Hey, nice to see you.

70
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,301
- Take care, guys.
- See you, man.

71
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,467
Can you imagine me back
on "melrose place"?

72
00:04:24,592 --> 00:04:26,628
Talkbout a return-to-glory story.

73
00:04:26,753 --> 00:04:29,250
Well, you're not available so
stop killing yourself about it.

74
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,554
Maybe I could get out of
my "five towns" contract.

75
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:34,021
Coakley says he's gonna torture
you for the rest of your life.

76
00:04:34,146 --> 00:04:36,280
- You know that's never gonna happen.
- Never say never.

77
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:38,598
Come on,
let's have some positivity, people.

78
00:04:38,723 --> 00:04:41,344
- Think it's possible, bro ?
- Anything's possible, johnny.

79
00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:43,865
- What should I do ?
- Call your agent.

80
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:45,951
It's 6 :00 in the morning.

81
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,288
- I didn't mean right this second.
- Yeah, maybe I'll wait 30 minutes.

82
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:52,218
- Where are you going ?
- I'm going to ashley's,

83
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:54,324
i got to know what I did.
- You've been drinking.

84
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:56,531
Yeah, okay, you're right.
Turtle, you gonna drive me ?

85
00:04:56,656 --> 00:04:58,387
What happened to taking a stand ?

86
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:00,756
- Come on, get up. I need a ride.
- Good luck.

87
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:12,073
I can't wait any longer.

88
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:17,722
Well, you have no temperature.

89
00:05:18,082 --> 00:05:20,133
Check it again. I know I'm dying.

90
00:05:20,258 --> 00:05:23,594
You're not dying. Leaving ari has
you fearing for your life, maybe.

91
00:05:23,913 --> 00:05:27,117
But this is going to be the best
thing that's ever happened to you.

92
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,285
Trust me.

93
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:32,718
- Is it ari ?
- Nope, johnny chase.

94
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,375
My only client.

95
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,797
What if he doesn't
want to come with me ?

96
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:39,254
Convey confidence and he will.

97
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,730
All right ?

98
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:44,955
- Hi, johnny.
- Hey, lloyd, I got some news.

99
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,671
I do as well. I've left
ari for greener pastures.

100
00:05:47,796 --> 00:05:49,999
I'd like a commitment from
you that you're coming with me.

101
00:05:50,124 --> 00:05:52,646
- You left ari ?
- I'm working with adam davies now.

102
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:55,896
- Jesus christ, not today !
- There's nothing to worry about.

103
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,161
Look, I think maybe I can
get on the new "melrose place"

104
00:05:58,286 --> 00:06:00,122
If I can get out of
my "five towns" contract.

105
00:06:00,247 --> 00:06:02,521
- Johnny...
- Lloyd, I need you to find out if it's true.

106
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:05,209
If it is, see if you can
get me out of that contract.

107
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:06,768
Are you gonna come with me ?

108
00:06:06,893 --> 00:06:09,372
Take care of what I just
told you and we'll talk, later

109
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,830
I am so screwed.

110
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,667
Christ, I've got work to do.

111
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,565
Grab me a handful of xanaxs,
would you ?

112
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,399
I'm okay, I'm in work mode. Go !

113
00:06:21,412 --> 00:06:23,020
Stop stop stop.

114
00:06:24,405 --> 00:06:26,805
-Want me to wait ?
-No, I'm all good.

115
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,730
You are a confident drunk.

116
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,567
Jesus christ, eric.
What are you doing ?

117
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,568
Let me in.

118
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,986
Go to the front.

119
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:47,923
- What time is it ?
- It's early.

120
00:06:48,172 --> 00:06:50,057
- You didn't call me back.
- I was going to.

121
00:06:50,182 --> 00:06:51,925
I didn't feel like waiting.

122
00:06:52,202 --> 00:06:54,121
- I don't want to get in a fight.
- Me either.

123
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,564
But I know I'm in trouble. And
since I know I didn't do anything

124
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:58,767
Why don't you tell me what the
problem is so I can clear this up ?

125
00:06:58,892 --> 00:07:00,796
- Are you drunk ?
- Not really.

126
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:02,129
What did I do ?

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,600
Who is rupert pupkin ?

128
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,302
What ?

129
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,034
Yesterday morning
when the phone rang

130
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:11,863
- You said it was turtle.
- It was.

131
00:07:11,988 --> 00:07:13,932
- Then you said it was drama.
- It was.

132
00:07:14,057 --> 00:07:16,643
Then the caller I.D.
Said it was rupert pupkin.

133
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,768
Jesus.

134
00:07:17,893 --> 00:07:19,735
Who is rupert pupkin ?

135
00:07:20,257 --> 00:07:21,380
It's...

136
00:07:21,838 --> 00:07:24,318
Well, he's a guy I've
been seeing on the side.

137
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:27,336
I'm kidding. It's vince's alias.

138
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:29,609
- His alias ?
- Yeah, he can't be calling people

139
00:07:29,622 --> 00:07:32,367
And vincent chase comes up.
It's from "king of comedy."

140
00:07:35,783 --> 00:07:38,416
- Why don't you trust me ?
- I don't know.

141
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,335
You're gonna have to learn
to or it's never gonna work.

142
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,577
This is why I didn't
want to talk last night.

143
00:07:43,702 --> 00:07:45,476
I don't want to be grilling you.

144
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:48,559
- Something about us is off.
- We're not off.

145
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,222
I'm not like this.

146
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:52,885
Then what are you like ? Tell
me, please, I want to know.

147
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,796
Eric, it's like 7:00 a. M.

148
00:07:56,271 --> 00:07:58,536
Good, that way we can
sleep before I go to work.

149
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:00,224
Oh, sleep ?

150
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:01,689
Yeah, trust me.

151
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,034
Okay, fine.

152
00:08:09,516 --> 00:08:10,516
Baby.

153
00:08:11,512 --> 00:08:13,012
I woke up with wood.

154
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:15,963
-And why is that my problem ?
-Just take care of me.

155
00:08:16,088 --> 00:08:18,054
How about you take care of me ?

156
00:08:18,179 --> 00:08:20,632
Come on, I have to work all
day. I don't want to work now.

157
00:08:20,757 --> 00:08:23,056
- Sorry.
- Okay, fine.

158
00:08:29,837 --> 00:08:33,888
- Jesus. - Rupert pupkin ?
- Vince.

159
00:08:34,442 --> 00:08:36,319
- Hello ?
- Oh god.

160
00:08:36,444 --> 00:08:39,195
Baby, I need at least a blowjob.

161
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,520
Blow yourself.

162
00:08:42,324 --> 00:08:43,397
Yo, buddy.

163
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:45,555
Yo, ari, sorry for calling so early.

164
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,520
- Everything okay ?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

165
00:08:47,645 --> 00:08:49,820
- It's johnny.
- I'm freaking out, ari.

166
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,226
What's the problem ?

167
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:54,051
He heard lloyd's going
over to adam davies.

168
00:08:56,531 --> 00:08:58,432
- Ari ?
- Adam davies ?

169
00:08:58,848 --> 00:09:00,247
Yeah, I assumed you knew.

170
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,124
Of course I knew.

171
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,245
Good riddance.
What's drama worried about ?

172
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,313
He's got a career crisis going on
and he's not sure lloyd can handle it.

173
00:09:07,438 --> 00:09:10,029
- Of course he can't handle it.
- I'm desperate for help, ari.

174
00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:12,801
Help is on the way.
Just give me the details.

175
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,428
I'm sorry you feel that way, ari.

176
00:09:17,553 --> 00:09:19,099
You're sorry, lloyd ?!

177
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:23,022
You have no idea how
sorry you're going to be.

178
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:27,205
I am going to destroy you.
I am going to erode

179
00:09:27,455 --> 00:09:30,194
Every fiber of your spirit.

180
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:31,756
You no longer exist.

181
00:09:31,881 --> 00:09:33,777
You are dead to me.

182
00:09:33,902 --> 00:09:37,303
And the town will know that
anyone meeting with you,

183
00:09:37,428 --> 00:09:40,060
Speaking with you,
or even nodding to you

184
00:09:40,185 --> 00:09:42,170
On the street will be dead as well.

185
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:45,789
So die, lloyd. Die die die !

186
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:48,463
And when you're
gagging on davies'balls

187
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,489
I want you to bite
down so he can die too.

188
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,550
Call dan coakley's office,

189
00:09:53,675 --> 00:09:55,878
Set up an emergency meeting asap.

190
00:09:58,023 --> 00:09:59,479
Welcome, lloyd.

191
00:10:00,964 --> 00:10:03,362
- Glad to have you onboard.
- Glad to be here, thank you.

192
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:06,939
Come on back. Gonna get an office ready for you after lunch.

193
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,111
But in the meantime, you
can use the conference room

194
00:10:09,236 --> 00:10:10,909
And jeff here will help
you with anything you need.

195
00:10:11,034 --> 00:10:12,349
- Thank you so much.

196
00:10:12,474 --> 00:10:15,677
Jeff, get dan coakley on the phone.
Tell him it's regarding johnny chase.

197
00:10:15,802 --> 00:10:18,657
And call phil yagoda over at "melrose
place." I need to speak with him as well.

198
00:10:18,782 --> 00:10:19,782
Got it.

199
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:22,956
Work mode already. I love it.

200
00:10:23,451 --> 00:10:26,125
Tell john I said welcome back.

201
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,250
Will do.

202
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,044
Okay, so the reason I didn't
want to see you last night

203
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:35,087
- Was 'cause I needed time to formulate a plan.
- What do you mean ?

204
00:10:35,376 --> 00:10:38,494
I mean, you show up and come at
me all like, "what's your deal ?"

205
00:10:38,619 --> 00:10:41,379
- And I wasn't prepared.
- So now you're prepared ?

206
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,308
Yes.

207
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,556
- Should I be worried ?
- No.

208
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:47,885
You should be excited
because I think I figured out

209
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,171
How to deal with all the
shit and move past it.

210
00:10:51,252 --> 00:10:52,652
Anything you need.

211
00:10:52,926 --> 00:10:55,143
Well, first off, I need
to know that your assistant

212
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:57,080
Who wants to ride you
will not be a problem.

213
00:10:57,205 --> 00:10:59,646
- My assistant ?
- The one that looks like a playmate.

214
00:11:00,238 --> 00:11:02,637
She doesn't want to ride me.
What are you talking about ?

215
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,721
Trust me, she does.

216
00:11:05,102 --> 00:11:07,773
When I stopped by your office
she was giving me dirty looks.

217
00:11:07,898 --> 00:11:09,376
I think you're imagining things.

218
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,824
I know what I saw.

219
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,958
Look, I like you, okay ?
I want this to work.

220
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,540
So just tell me what you need.

221
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,232
I want to read your emails.

222
00:11:20,234 --> 00:11:21,708
You want to read my emails ?

223
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,455
Just from the last week or so.

224
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,402
I just want to see
who you've been talking to

225
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:27,111
And how you've been talking to them.

226
00:11:27,471 --> 00:11:29,573
If there's nothing weird,
I'll never ask again.

227
00:11:30,351 --> 00:11:32,209
- Are you serious ?
- Yes.

228
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:34,134
And you can read mine too.

229
00:11:34,648 --> 00:11:38,447
I want us to have totally
open and honest relationship.

230
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:40,611
Here.

231
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,419
Why is nobody calling me back ?

232
00:11:45,544 --> 00:11:48,039
- This is a freaking nightmare.
- It's early, johnny.

233
00:11:48,164 --> 00:11:49,851
Relax, ari said he'd handle it.

234
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:53,253
What if he doesn't ? I miss this, I
may never get another opportunity.

235
00:11:53,378 --> 00:11:56,291
- Drama, you got to calm down.
- I can't calm down.

236
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:59,112
Come on, ring, phone.
Ring, god damn it ! Ring !

237
00:12:00,484 --> 00:12:01,634
That's jamie.

238
00:12:01,994 --> 00:12:04,096
- All right, guys.
- Have fun.

239
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:08,612
- Okay, I'm nervous.
- About what ?

240
00:12:08,737 --> 00:12:10,854
- You haven't done anything.
- Yeah.

241
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:13,795
- Man up, turtle.
- All right. Good luck.

242
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,576
- Later.
- Later.

243
00:12:16,641 --> 00:12:17,641
Finally.

244
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,771
- Give me something good, lloyd.
- I spoke with phil yagoda.

245
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:22,447
- Yeah ?
- "Melrose" is real.

246
00:12:22,572 --> 00:12:25,247
Phil likes you for the role but
you'd have to test for the network.

247
00:12:25,372 --> 00:12:26,953
How many other people are testing ?

248
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,580
They have no one else right now.

249
00:12:28,911 --> 00:12:30,227
I like those odds.

250
00:12:30,352 --> 00:12:32,127
If you don't get it,
you'll have nothing.

251
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,012
So my recommendation personally is
you stick with the paycheck you have.

252
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:37,210
No way.
This opportunity is meant to be.

253
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:39,112
I'm walking dead at "five towns."

254
00:12:39,237 --> 00:12:41,593
- Have you spoken to coakley yet ?
- I left word.

255
00:12:41,718 --> 00:12:43,678
- Leave word again.
- I'm into it, johnny.

256
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,473
So is ari, lloyd. Just so you know.

257
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,875
I wish you hadn't done that.
Why did you do that, johnny ?

258
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,876
'cause this is my life, lloyd.

259
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,519
Try dan coakley again now.

260
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,485
Since when do you get involved
in low-level tv actor discussions ?

261
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:01,075
- Since now, dan.
- Since it's vincent chase's brother.

262
00:13:01,962 --> 00:13:04,491
I'm asking for a favor, all
right ? Cut the kid loose.

263
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,579
But, ari, come on.
You don't know understand

264
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:08,867
How much happy it makes
me to see him suffer.

265
00:13:09,943 --> 00:13:11,509
You're on the waiting list at riv.

266
00:13:11,634 --> 00:13:13,425
How happy would it make
you to be a member ?

267
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,653
- You can move me up that list ?
- I can move mountains, dan.

268
00:13:16,778 --> 00:13:19,150
And all I've got to do is just
let him out of his contract ?

269
00:13:20,122 --> 00:13:22,575
I'm sorry,
a lloyd lee on the line again.

270
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,331
He says it's truly urgent.

271
00:13:24,456 --> 00:13:26,476
One other thing you'd have to do.

272
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:29,694
I'm sorry, mr. Lee, but mr.
Coakley says that any discussions

273
00:13:29,819 --> 00:13:33,061
About johnny chase will have
to be with his agent ari gold,

274
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,241
And that he will not be
returning your call ever.

275
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:37,524
Ever ?

276
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,651
Why would he when you're a dead man ?

277
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:42,070
I'm everywhere, lloyd.

278
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:46,199
I can't believe you
handed over your berry.

279
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:48,326
I didn't know what to do.
I was so shocked.

280
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,185
You should have told
her to file a subpoena.

281
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,666
Yeah, you have nothing
to hide anyway.

282
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,633
- No, what do I have to hide ?
- Nothing.

283
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,590
- I got to go to work.
- Enjoy.

284
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:57,365
I'll talk to you later.

285
00:13:58,597 --> 00:14:00,211
Morning, brit. Any calls ?

286
00:14:00,336 --> 00:14:02,048
Yeah, you got a bunch of messages.

287
00:14:02,173 --> 00:14:04,181
Thanks. You okay ?

288
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,430
Yeah.

289
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:07,762
Okay.

290
00:14:09,643 --> 00:14:10,693
Actually...

291
00:14:11,773 --> 00:14:14,282
- I need to apologize.
- For what ?

292
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,267
Yesterday when your girlfriend
came in, I think I was kind of rude.

293
00:14:17,392 --> 00:14:19,518
Really ? She didn't mention anything.

294
00:14:19,643 --> 00:14:22,040
Oh good. Good, I'm relieved.
I was just distracted.

295
00:14:22,282 --> 00:14:23,945
Oh, sorry. Everything all right ?

296
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,319
Yeah, just some boy trouble.

297
00:14:26,444 --> 00:14:27,726
- Oh, sorry.
- I'll deal.

298
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:29,814
Well, if you ever need
to talk about anything.

299
00:14:30,188 --> 00:14:31,738
- With you ?
- Yeah.

300
00:14:31,863 --> 00:14:33,888
We should be able to talk
about that stuff, right ?

301
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:36,256
Is there something
on your mind, eric ?

302
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,393
Actually...

303
00:14:38,956 --> 00:14:41,173
Would you ever ask
a guy to read his emails ?

304
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:43,448
No. I'd just look at them.

305
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:45,685
Kidding.

306
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,410
- Did ashley ?
- Yes.

307
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:49,858
Why ? What did you do ?

308
00:14:49,983 --> 00:14:51,756
- I didn't do anything.
- You had to have.

309
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,226
I lied to her once
about my ex calling.

310
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:56,955
- Do you still see her ?
- My ex ? Not like that.

311
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,948
The last time I saw her
I ditched her for ashley.

312
00:14:59,073 --> 00:15:01,437
- So ashley's paranoid ?
- Yeah, she's got some trust issues.

313
00:15:01,562 --> 00:15:03,689
- Obviously.
- So you don't think she's warranted ?

314
00:15:04,021 --> 00:15:05,721
No, I think she's crazy.

315
00:15:12,434 --> 00:15:15,138
- Are you okay ?
- Yeah, why ?

316
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,651
- You're acting weird.
- Weird ?

317
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:19,961
Yeah, you're so quiet.

318
00:15:20,381 --> 00:15:22,438
No, just thinking about class,

319
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:24,306
Hoping there's not like a pop quiz.

320
00:15:24,431 --> 00:15:26,381
Do you get those in college ?

321
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:28,406
No.

322
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:38,325
What's wrong ?

323
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,271
Nothing.

324
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,362
Really.

325
00:15:40,835 --> 00:15:42,484
Tell me about this meeting.

326
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:45,702
Okay, well, it's josh schwartz

327
00:15:45,827 --> 00:15:47,974
And he's got this
new show that I love.

328
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:51,041
It's called "runaways" and
it's about these two girls

329
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,942
Who are completely
in debt and jobless

330
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:56,349
And hate their lives
and they run away to l. A.

331
00:15:56,474 --> 00:15:57,824
It's really good.

332
00:15:57,949 --> 00:16:01,936
But I have to do a "bahston" accent.

333
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,285
I've never really done an accent.

334
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,783
- You could do it.
- You think ?

335
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,640
I know you can. And I
know you're gonna get this.

336
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:11,836
- I feel it.
- Thanks.

337
00:16:16,663 --> 00:16:18,893
Are those the whores
who stole your underwear ?

338
00:16:19,643 --> 00:16:20,562
What ?

339
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:23,654
The sorority hos
that are staring at us.

340
00:16:24,111 --> 00:16:25,461
Yeah, I think so.

341
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:28,478
The brunette's pretty cute.

342
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,000
You think ?

343
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,256
You don't think so ?

344
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,118
Nah, she's not my type.

345
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:39,616
- Okay, you'd better get to class.
- Yup.

346
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:41,731
If my meeting finishes
early I'll pick you up.

347
00:16:41,856 --> 00:16:44,943
Don't worry about it. Vince
is bored and wants to drive.

348
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:47,535
- Good luck at your meeting.
- Thanks.

349
00:16:49,904 --> 00:16:51,756
- Turtle !
- Yeah ?

350
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:55,760
Come here.

351
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,233
How did you do it, ari ? How ?

352
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,971
That's what I do. I part seas.

353
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:12,794
Don't try to comprehend it.
Just be thankful

354
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:15,571
That you've been blessed
with the proximity to it.

355
00:17:15,696 --> 00:17:18,074
- I can't thank you enough.
- Actually, you can.

356
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:20,916
- How ?
- By staying with me. By not going with lloyd.

357
00:17:21,945 --> 00:17:23,900
You want to represent me ?

358
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:26,699
Hell yeah. You're family.
I wouldn't have it any other way.

359
00:17:26,824 --> 00:17:28,505
Make sure you kill that test.

360
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,488
I will, ari. Thanks.

361
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,915
- My pleasure. Bye.
- Bye.

362
00:17:33,436 --> 00:17:35,251
I'm off "five towns."

363
00:17:35,376 --> 00:17:38,120
- How do you feel ?
- Relieved.

364
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,268
You've got to be shittng me.

365
00:17:46,644 --> 00:17:49,581
Lloyd, here's the bottom
line, as hard as it is to hear.

366
00:17:49,706 --> 00:17:52,480
I let u be my agent
because ari would not be.

367
00:17:52,993 --> 00:17:54,349
We had some fun.

368
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,908
And now not only does
ari want to sign me,

369
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:59,661
But he took care of what
you could not take care of.

370
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,679
What else is there to say ?

371
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:04,345
Johnny drama,
I got you on "five towns."

372
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,131
- Ari has never even seen it.
- Really ?

373
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,555
I don't think he's seen
anything you've ever done.

374
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:11,990
How is that possible ?

375
00:18:12,115 --> 00:18:14,208
I've seen everything
from "viking quest"

376
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,885
To the new "new love boat."

377
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:17,801
That pilot never even aired.

378
00:18:17,926 --> 00:18:20,056
You were a tremendous
young merrill stubing.

379
00:18:20,528 --> 00:18:22,142
- You think ?
- I know.

380
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,644
Johnny, you've been my one
client for over two years.

381
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:28,716
And I will continue to treat
you like you're my only client

382
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,768
For the rest of your career.
Will ari ?

383
00:18:31,142 --> 00:18:33,820
I will be devastated if
I lose you, johnny drama.

384
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:35,641
You think ari will even care ?

385
00:18:35,891 --> 00:18:38,642
I believe in your talent. Does ari ?

386
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:41,576
Or does he want you because he
doesn't want to piss off vince ?

387
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:44,264
Or does he want you just
so he can piss me off ?

388
00:18:45,282 --> 00:18:48,001
This is the first day
of the rest of your life.

389
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,064
What do you want ?

390
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,608
Britney thinks ashley's crazy.

391
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,814
- I think britney wants you.
- So ashley's not crazy ?

392
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,596
She may be, but I think regardless,
britney's trying to move her out of the way.

393
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,090
- So what do I do ?
- How hot is britney ?

394
00:19:02,215 --> 00:19:03,697
Will you stop it, vince ?

395
00:19:03,822 --> 00:19:06,247
You want me to come down there
and move her out of your way ?

396
00:19:06,372 --> 00:19:07,372
Vince.

397
00:19:07,732 --> 00:19:10,027
Look, e, how did you feel
about that email thing ?

398
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:11,931
Well, I feel violated.

399
00:19:12,056 --> 00:19:14,390
Your instincts about
ashley from minute one

400
00:19:14,515 --> 00:19:16,362
Were that all signs
pointed to crazy.

401
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:19,287
- I guess I need to end it.
- I think you do.

402
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,515
I wasn't expecting so much math.

403
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,643
It is a business class, turtle.

404
00:19:23,768 --> 00:19:26,353
- Yeah.
- But I think you're doing great.

405
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,409
- Thanks. See you Friday.
- All right.

406
00:19:30,322 --> 00:19:34,493
So wow, you and jamie are
like a real couple, huh ?

407
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:36,311
What did you think ?

408
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:37,586
I don't know.

409
00:19:37,955 --> 00:19:41,130
I mean, you see stuff in tabloids
and never know if it's true or not.

410
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:42,504
It is.

411
00:19:42,853 --> 00:19:44,103
That's too bad.

412
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Yeah.

413
00:19:45,902 --> 00:19:48,313
- Yo, turtle.
- Yo.

414
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:50,493
Is that vincent chas

415
00:19:50,618 --> 00:19:52,222
Yeah. Got to go.

416
00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:55,107
- Who are you ?
- I'm turtle.

417
00:19:55,747 --> 00:19:57,195
See you later.

418
00:19:59,886 --> 00:20:00,886
What up ?

419
00:20:02,937 --> 00:20:04,786
- That the girl ?
- Yup.

420
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,955
- She's cute.
- Yup.

421
00:20:07,676 --> 00:20:09,304
You all right ?

422
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:11,688
I'm in the middle of a
serious love triangle, vin.

423
00:20:11,813 --> 00:20:15,252
- It's never happened to me before.
- It's nice, isn't it ?

424
00:20:15,377 --> 00:20:18,027
No, it's not nice.
It's freaking me out.

425
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,268
- Ari.
- Yeah ?

426
00:20:21,393 --> 00:20:24,499
- A johnny chase is here.
- Hey, drama, what's happening ?

427
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:27,525
Not much. Thought I'd come
by and see my new agent.

428
00:20:31,024 --> 00:20:32,897
Look, if you're busy
I can come back.

429
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,189
Yeah, I've got a stack of scripts.

430
00:20:35,771 --> 00:20:38,278
- You want to grab lunch ?
- Lunch ?

431
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,278
- My treat.
- No, I can't grab lunch.

432
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,800
I understand.

433
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:45,729
Maybe tomorrow.

434
00:20:45,854 --> 00:20:47,548
Or dinner. Or breakfast.

435
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:49,706
Is there something you
want to talk about ?

436
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:53,251
Do you like me, ari ?

437
00:20:53,464 --> 00:20:55,086
You're freaking me out, drama.

438
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:57,755
- Do you think I'm talented ?
- Are you having a breakdown ?

439
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,632
No, seriously. I want to know.

440
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:02,810
Yes, I think you are talented.

441
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,961
- What have you liked me in ?
- Okay, what is this about ?

442
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:08,016
I want to know why
you want to sign me.

443
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,563
Did lloyd call you ?

444
00:21:09,688 --> 00:21:12,060
He couldn't have possibly
made an impression.

445
00:21:12,185 --> 00:21:14,772
- He believes in me.
- He is a child.

446
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,538
- But he believes in me.
- So do I.

447
00:21:16,663 --> 00:21:17,716
- Do you ?
- Yes.

448
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:20,541
Or do you hate him so much
That you'd take me to spite him ?

449
00:21:20,873 --> 00:21:22,989
- Drama...
- Just answer me, ari.

450
00:21:23,114 --> 00:21:26,534
Do you believe in my talent ?
Because this is my life.

451
00:21:26,837 --> 00:21:29,782
What you did for me
today was amazing.

452
00:21:29,907 --> 00:21:33,078
I'll never forget it. If you
really want me here, I'm here.

453
00:21:33,203 --> 00:21:35,461
But you've got to be honest with me.

454
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:39,435
You've got to look me in the face and
tell me that you believe in my talent

455
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,177
Or you've got to let me go.

456
00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:46,649
Go.

457
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:49,531
But it's because I like you,
all right.

458
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,421
And believe me, that little prick's gonna
have plenty of time to take care of you.

459
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,650
- Thank you, ari.
- Good luck to you, drama.

460
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,625
And tell that man of yours to keep his eyes

461
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,876
pinned wide open 'cause I'm gonna be gunning for him.

462
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:03,001
I will.

463
00:22:07,805 --> 00:22:10,383
All right, lloyd,
I'll sign with you.

464
00:22:10,508 --> 00:22:12,622
Yippie-ki-yay, motherfucker !

465
00:22:12,747 --> 00:22:14,658
- Calm down, lloyd.
- I can't.

466
00:22:14,783 --> 00:22:16,972
We're gonna make magic
together, johnny drama.

467
00:22:17,097 --> 00:22:19,162
Let me just please get this show.

468
00:22:19,287 --> 00:22:21,911
You will.
I believe in you, johnny drama !

469
00:22:22,036 --> 00:22:23,424
I believe !

470
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,630
Thanks, lloyd. Later.

471
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,066
Thank you.

472
00:22:34,191 --> 00:22:35,843
- Sorry I'm late.
- No problem.

473
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:38,701
- I got stuck on a conference call.
- That's okay.

474
00:22:39,381 --> 00:22:41,330
I wanted to talk to
you about something.

475
00:22:41,455 --> 00:22:43,279
I wanted to talk to you too.

476
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:44,704
Can I go first ?

477
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:46,379
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

478
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:47,958
Sorry.

479
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,183
That's okay.

480
00:22:51,831 --> 00:22:52,981
I feel awful.

481
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:56,178
I should not have asked
you to show me your emails.

482
00:22:56,685 --> 00:22:59,625
It's just that if we're
going to have a relationship...

483
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,156
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

484
00:23:04,178 --> 00:23:06,381
I think part of the reason
you're feeling insecure...

485
00:23:07,048 --> 00:23:09,595
I thought I turned this thing off.

486
00:23:11,445 --> 00:23:14,294
Ahem. I think part of the reason
that you're feeling insecure

487
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:17,490
Is because I'm not totally there.

488
00:23:19,248 --> 00:23:20,606
Are you breaking up with me ?

489
00:23:20,861 --> 00:23:23,072
It's just not a good time
for me right now, ashley.

490
00:23:23,197 --> 00:23:25,365
But this morning you felt different ?

491
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:29,666
Who is that ?
- Calm down. It's just my office.

492
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:32,201
Just your assistant, you mean.
- Yeah, she does work for me.

493
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,971
- And what else does she do for you ?
- Is that what this is really about ?

494
00:23:36,224 --> 00:23:39,592
I was right, wasn't I ?
She wants you and you like it.

495
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,725
Answer the phone if not.

496
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,172
- Let's hear you talk to her.
- No.

497
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,254
- Why, 'cause you're lying ?
- Because it's not her.

498
00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:48,701
- Who is it then, sloan ?
- Would you calm down, please ?

499
00:23:48,826 --> 00:23:50,804
Don't tell me to calm down.
Just tell me who it is.

500
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,179
It's my aunt. Are you happy ? Look.

501
00:23:55,112 --> 00:23:56,794
- I'm sorry.
- I should go.

502
00:23:56,919 --> 00:23:59,812
- Please don't.
- There's nothing left to talk about.

503
00:23:59,937 --> 00:24:01,444
I can't believe this.

504
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:03,962
You know, you are really
a piece-of-shit liar.

505
00:24:04,087 --> 00:24:06,018
You love fucking with me, don't you ?

506
00:24:06,143 --> 00:24:08,654
You just said this morning, you wanted
to be exclusive, so you could

507
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:10,618
use me and pull this shit now.

508
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,803
I can't believe I fell
for your nice guy act.

509
00:24:14,598 --> 00:24:15,932
You are really sick.

510
00:24:16,057 --> 00:24:17,497
I'm sorry you feel that way.

511
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,132
And I'm sorry you're a douchebag.

512
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,555
Look, I didn't lie to
you about anything.

513
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,230
I actually liked you.

514
00:24:23,355 --> 00:24:25,412
But you show up at
the premiere uninvited,

515
00:24:25,537 --> 00:24:27,877
You check my phone, you
listen to my messages,

516
00:24:28,002 --> 00:24:29,452
You want my emails.

517
00:24:29,978 --> 00:24:33,138
You say you're not crazy, but
all signs point to the contrary.

518
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:34,919
I'm sorry.

519
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,657
Hey, anything important ?
I was just eating dinner.

520
00:24:44,782 --> 00:24:46,853
She ask to see blood samples ?

521
00:24:46,978 --> 00:24:48,585
- No.
- You sound sad.

522
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,773
- I broke up with her.
- Oh.

523
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:53,518
- Come meet me for a drink.
- I don't think that's such a good idea.

524
00:24:53,643 --> 00:24:56,088
Eric, don't be ridiculous.
I'm not after you.

525
00:24:56,213 --> 00:24:58,428
But I've got a couple of
cute friends who might be.

526
00:24:58,553 --> 00:25:00,703
- And you're sad.
- I'm not sad.

527
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,090
Okay.

528
00:25:02,926 --> 00:25:05,207
- Your friends cute ?
- My friends are hot.

529
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:08,276
- Maybe call some of your friends ?
- Okay.

530
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:10,079
We're at the green door. Hurry up.

531
00:25:10,204 --> 00:25:12,054
I'll see you in 15 minutes.

532
00:25:18,465 --> 00:25:20,506
This time you're
doing single right, e.

533
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:22,781
- Like you ?
- You know it, son.

534
00:25:22,906 --> 00:25:25,156
Some people actually like
being in a relationship.

535
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:27,108
Indeed. Love is underrated.

536
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:29,839
- What ?
- No, it's...

537
00:25:30,218 --> 00:25:33,613
I just broke up with someone
recently and I'm feelingomeopre.

538
00:25:33,738 --> 00:25:35,202
- He was a prick.
- Loser.

539
00:25:36,932 --> 00:25:39,412
- If you're looking for a rebound...
- I'm not.

540
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:42,748
I'm not either.

541
00:25:44,161 --> 00:25:46,961
So how do you think e will
last on the open market ?

542
00:25:47,086 --> 00:25:48,196
Nine days.

543
00:25:48,321 --> 00:25:51,105
I think someone will pick
him up pretty quickly.

544
00:25:51,887 --> 00:25:53,759
Not me. I'm a career gal.

545
00:25:53,884 --> 00:25:55,753
Which means you don't
look at her either, vince.

546
00:25:55,878 --> 00:25:57,710
No one goes near my assistant.
You hear that, drama ?

547
00:25:57,835 --> 00:26:01,203
Don't worry, I'm on a no-sex-till-I-book-
"melrose" thing anyway.

548
00:26:01,328 --> 00:26:03,169
Oh, that's too bad.

549
00:26:04,317 --> 00:26:05,771
I'm kidding.

550
00:26:07,017 --> 00:26:08,784
Speaking of girlfriends.

551
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:10,373
You guys mind keeping it down ?

552
00:26:10,498 --> 00:26:12,313
She's been a little jealous lately.

553
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,780
Hey, babe.
You ready for me to pick you up ?

554
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,063
Yeah, but my agent just called me.

555
00:26:17,507 --> 00:26:19,532
- Did you get the role ?
- Not that one.

556
00:26:19,657 --> 00:26:21,722
But they offered me the
lead in another series.

557
00:26:22,027 --> 00:26:23,331
That's great. Is it good ?

558
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,378
- It's great.
- That's awesome.

559
00:26:26,722 --> 00:26:28,628
But it shoots in new zealand.
