Subtitles: swsub.com

3
00:01:16,029 --> 00:01:18,894
I am nuts or what a hootie
make me look 10 years younger?

4
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:21,451
- 10 years younger than him maybe.
- Blow me, E.

5
00:01:21,545 --> 00:01:24,354
I don't know why you're so nervous.
You're just going back to work.

6
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,218
Guys at work think I'm old, bro.

7
00:01:26,325 --> 00:01:28,454
They treat me old,
and the writers write me old.

8
00:01:28,587 --> 00:01:30,090
This season I'm aging down.

9
00:01:30,184 --> 00:01:32,650
I'm gonna get me a storyline
with someone around 19.

10
00:01:32,838 --> 00:01:35,472
- He'll play your boy toy.
- Would you look at this beast?

11
00:01:35,566 --> 00:01:38,297
Looks just like the one I got
at the army/navy in the sixth grade.

12
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,864
Yeah, only about two grand more.

13
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:42,024
Two grand just to hang
with the cool kids, huh?

14
00:01:42,212 --> 00:01:44,866
Great, Johnny,
you know what? It's on me.

15
00:01:45,618 --> 00:01:46,863
You come into some money, bro?

16
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,624
- No, we got into Cannes.
- It's film festival, not a job, Vince.

17
00:01:49,738 --> 00:01:51,851
Jobs are coming, E.
I can feel it.

18
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:54,309
Here's my Barney's card.
knock yourself out.

19
00:01:54,638 --> 00:01:56,587
- I'll take it off my tab, bro.
- Sweet.

20
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,719
We got Walsh upstairs in five.
See you later.

21
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,246
- Later.
- Have fun, boys.

22
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,587
All right, you buying that
or what, pretty woman?

23
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,113
Not now, Turtle.
check out that hat.

24
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,617
- What about it?
- It's awesome.

25
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:09,877
The potheads at work will freak.

26
00:02:09,995 --> 00:02:12,977
Potheads? You're aging yourself
up with that phrase, Drama.

27
00:02:13,094 --> 00:02:15,302
Yo, pretty dope lid
you're sporting there, hombre.

28
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:16,499
Where'd you get it?

29
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,878
So maybe we should start thinking
about a new house.

30
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,874
Maybe we should start
thinking about a new job.

31
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,832
I told you, E, jobs are coming.

32
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:25,588
God, you're so negative.

33
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:29,216
- Snoop, what up?
- Nothing like you got going on.

34
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,852
- What's up, Snoop?
- What's up, E?

35
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,312
See you all got that <i>Medellin</i>
in into Cannes or is it Cannes?

36
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,507
- It's Cannes.
- Really?

37
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,043
- Either way, man, congratulations.
- Thanks.

38
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,542
And I seen the trailer.
That motherfucker's off the hook.

39
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:44,961
- Where?
- On YouTube this morning.

40
00:02:45,126 --> 00:02:46,815
Y'all make <i>Blow</i>
look like <i>Romper Room</i>.

41
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:49,574
- Thanks.
- Success and nothing less, man.

42
00:02:49,738 --> 00:02:51,946
- All right, we'll see you next time.
- Peace.

43
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:53,830
Somebody leaked the trailer?

44
00:02:53,947 --> 00:02:57,118
- Walsh should be happy.
- I think he already isn't.

45
00:02:57,821 --> 00:02:58,948
Hey, what's up, Billy?

46
00:02:59,793 --> 00:03:02,258
Nothing good.
Somebody put the trailer on the net.

47
00:03:02,369 --> 00:03:04,600
- Yeah, I know. We just heard.
- Yeah, any idea who?

48
00:03:04,798 --> 00:03:06,043
Just one.

49
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:08,788
What, are you kidding me?

50
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:11,368
- I only gave it to you.
- Yeah, and it's at my house.

51
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:13,876
Yeah, and now
it's all over the fucking Internet,

52
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:16,852
- you rat cocksucker.
- Listen, E would never do that.

53
00:03:16,962 --> 00:03:18,558
He hated the movie. he was wrong.

54
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:21,150
Now he's trying to sabotage it
no matter what it does to you.

55
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:22,233
Fuck you.

56
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:24,907
No, fuck you. You suck at your job.
You got a napoleonic complex,

57
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:26,997
and I'm gonna fuck your mother
if I ever meet her.

58
00:03:27,045 --> 00:03:28,843
- Get your finger out of my face.
- Or what?

59
00:03:28,867 --> 00:03:31,069
- It's gonna end up up your ass.
- Why don't you admit

60
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:33,450
that you're a traitorous
pussy and you like to suck cock?

61
00:03:40,415 --> 00:03:43,088
Are you sure the kid said 7263 melrose?

62
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:44,866
Yeah, right next to Albano's.

63
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,923
This don't look like a clothing store.

64
00:03:50,203 --> 00:03:51,417
Look again.

65
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:54,750
You smell that?

66
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,353
Yeah, albano's.
We'll get a slice of pepperoni after.

67
00:03:57,557 --> 00:03:59,038
I'm not talking about pizza.

68
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:01,100
That's some fine herb.

69
00:04:01,591 --> 00:04:03,037
Yeah, what is this place?

70
00:04:06,364 --> 00:04:07,506
Heaven maybe.

71
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:12,754
- Can I help you fellas?
- Yes, I believe you can.

72
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:16,622
I would like to purchase one black
California homegrown trucker hat,

73
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,806
similar to the one on
that fella over there.

74
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:20,578
Sure, chief,
soon as I see your card.

75
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:22,518
Card, what card?

76
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:24,549
The card that says you're allowed in.

77
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:29,044
Why wouldn't I be allowed in?

78
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:32,621
I hope there are no discriminatory
practices going on here, because...

79
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,385
Is this a medical marijuana facility?

80
00:04:35,122 --> 00:04:37,211
And no card, no service.

81
00:04:38,474 --> 00:04:40,082
Something about getting my weed legally

82
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,387
Just never seemed right,
but this looks okay.

83
00:04:42,508 --> 00:04:43,528
It is okay.

84
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:45,568
Look, I don't want any weed.
I just want the hat.

85
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,337
Well, you can't get that hat,
not without a card. Sorry.

86
00:04:49,314 --> 00:04:50,845
Come on, Drama, it's just a hat.

87
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:52,700
It's not just a hat, Turtle.

88
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:55,010
It's the key to me landing
the cover of "tiger beat."

89
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:56,731
Where do I get one of these cards?

90
00:04:56,877 --> 00:04:58,310
You need a doctor's prescription.

91
00:04:59,043 --> 00:05:00,622
Yeah, that's great, just great.

92
00:05:01,457 --> 00:05:02,866
- Let's go, Drama.
- Where to?

93
00:05:03,253 --> 00:05:05,479
Get you checked out.
I know a guy, come on.

94
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:09,973
You're not gonna take Ari
down too, are you?

95
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:12,490
That's funny, but this kid's
had it coming for a long time.

96
00:05:12,588 --> 00:05:13,935
But in the middle of Barney's?

97
00:05:13,984 --> 00:05:15,721
I should have done it
a month ago on set,

98
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:18,441
- saved myself the ulcer.
- you're lucky you didn't get arrested.

99
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:20,415
He's lucky that busboy
was there to pull me off.

100
00:05:20,464 --> 00:05:21,806
I would have fuckin' killed him.

101
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,973
Somebody's got
a sexy tear in their shirt.

102
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,754
Oh, man, I just bought this.

103
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:28,456
No need to get upset.
If you take it off I could sew it,

104
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,011
good as new in a mere moment.

105
00:05:30,223 --> 00:05:32,749
Save your homoerotic
slave labor for me, Lloyd.

106
00:05:32,846 --> 00:05:35,217
Don't take your shirt off.
I don't want anyone going blind

107
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:37,744
from the reflection off
your translucent boy chest.

108
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:40,234
Don't start with E, Ari.
He's very aggressive today.

109
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:41,449
Ooh, that's scary.

110
00:05:41,623 --> 00:05:43,372
So my services are not required?

111
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,577
- Thanks anyway.
- Let's do this.

112
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,278
Did you hear about the trailer?

113
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,860
That's all I've been hearing about.

114
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,155
How many calls
have we gotten already about Vince?

115
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:52,394
A baker's dozen, at least.

116
00:05:52,487 --> 00:05:54,703
Including Jeff Katzenberg,
who called and said

117
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,409
it was like
when he saw the <i>Ray</i> trailer

118
00:05:56,507 --> 00:05:58,641
and knew that Jamie Foxx
was gonna get an Oscar nom.

119
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,443
- So this is good news?
- No, this is not good news.

120
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:04,613
Good news is when the wife agrees
to eat box for your birthday.

121
00:06:04,873 --> 00:06:06,403
This is great news!

122
00:06:06,452 --> 00:06:08,225
I told you
things were gonna start turning.

123
00:06:08,298 --> 00:06:09,463
they are turning fast.

124
00:06:09,511 --> 00:06:11,549
Every studio in town
wants to take a meeting.

125
00:06:12,144 --> 00:06:14,172
But I only wanna take
one meeting with one studio,

126
00:06:14,235 --> 00:06:15,482
if you guys are still onboard.

127
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:16,971
- Still onboard with what?
- Well,

128
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:19,081
even though
I pretty much find E useless,

129
00:06:19,252 --> 00:06:21,948
- He did slip me this one year ago.
- You remembered this, Ari.

130
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:23,527
Don't get all misty on me, E.

131
00:06:23,609 --> 00:06:26,233
<i>Lost in the clouds</i>,
about the hiker up mount Annapurna.

132
00:06:26,281 --> 00:06:29,536
- I love that story.
- It is on a fast track. Good eye, E.

133
00:06:29,761 --> 00:06:32,555
Guess who's in control of this one.
Dana Gordon.

134
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,137
Dana gordon?

135
00:06:34,471 --> 00:06:35,611
She hates you, doesn't she?

136
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:37,780
- Only until she loves me again.
- You got her fired.

137
00:06:37,847 --> 00:06:39,854
Yes, I did, but now
she's got a new bigger job.

138
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,728
It would have taken her years
without a good goddamn kick in the ass.

139
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:45,538
Plus, I got pictures,
slides actually, of her

140
00:06:46,624 --> 00:06:49,189
begging me. You know what I'm saying?
So here's the deal.

141
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:51,161
Now I am ready

142
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:54,238
to clear my calendar
and focus on one mission

143
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:56,627
if you choose to accept.
Do you choose?

144
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:58,694
- Absolutely.
- Get us a payday, Ari.

145
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,804
Choose some clothes other than
the ones from the salvation army, E.

146
00:07:01,872 --> 00:07:03,956
- This is Ralph Lauren, Ari.
- One more thing:

147
00:07:04,247 --> 00:07:07,235
My boy Elvis Mitchell, former superstar
critic of the New York Times,

148
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,393
is in town doing a piece
for Interview magazine

149
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:12,146
about the brains behind <i>Medellin</i>...
and you too, E.

150
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:13,648
- Really?
- Nice.

151
00:07:13,815 --> 00:07:15,637
Gotta keep that momentum pushing.

152
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:17,686
Can you do early drinks
at the Beverly Wilshire?

153
00:07:17,754 --> 00:07:19,188
- Sure.
- And call Walsh.

154
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,864
No problem.

155
00:07:22,283 --> 00:07:23,376
Thanks.

156
00:07:25,474 --> 00:07:27,952
- I gotta use my real name?
- You want the card?

157
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,715
I wanna improve my image, Turtle,

158
00:07:30,812 --> 00:07:32,391
not end up in US Weekly headline.

159
00:07:32,548 --> 00:07:35,373
You should be so lucky,
and this is not headline material.

160
00:07:35,786 --> 00:07:37,008
This is perfectly legal.

161
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,872
All you have to do is convince them
there's something wrong with you.

162
00:07:39,945 --> 00:07:41,828
But there's not.
I'm the picture of health.

163
00:07:43,252 --> 00:07:45,657
Hey, kid,
what are you claiming?

164
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,791
Nerve damage
from a skateboarding accident.

165
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:51,682
And you?

166
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:54,106
Same, but from a car accident.

167
00:07:55,848 --> 00:07:57,646
How about you
on a motorcycle accident?

168
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:00,749
- And I have nerve damage?
- Sure, why not?

169
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:04,300
Because I'm too physically fit
to have nerve damage.

170
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:06,197
- Look at these pipes.
- Oh, God.

171
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,010
- Johnny Chase.
- Right here.

172
00:08:08,308 --> 00:08:09,522
Follow me.

173
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,660
What are you gonna go with?

174
00:08:12,175 --> 00:08:13,645
My improv skills.

175
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,220
You have legionnaire's disease?

176
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,459
That's right.

177
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:19,984
Legionnaire's disease
is a chronic lung disorder.

178
00:08:20,643 --> 00:08:22,100
I know.
It's terrible.

179
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,338
I don't think smoking marijuana

180
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:28,929
is the right treatment
for a chronic lung disease, do you?

181
00:08:31,207 --> 00:08:32,446
Well, you're the doc.

182
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:36,498
Typically, medical marijuana
is used to treat nausea

183
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:39,550
- as related to cancer.
- I don't have cancer.

184
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:41,186
- Crohn's disease?
- What's that?

185
00:08:42,345 --> 00:08:45,601
Intestinal problems,
extreme bouts of diarrhea?

186
00:08:45,836 --> 00:08:47,269
Thank you, no.

187
00:08:47,463 --> 00:08:49,990
- Aids?
- Tested biweekly. No no.

188
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,080
I think we're at a stalemate here.

189
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,460
Hey, doc, can I be honest with you?

190
00:08:56,365 --> 00:08:57,603
I don't want any pot.

191
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,831
I just want the hat
that they sell at the place.

192
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,257
That's all. Just a hat.

193
00:09:01,438 --> 00:09:03,065
Well, could I be honest with you?

194
00:09:03,357 --> 00:09:06,393
I can't give you a card unless
you give me a legitimate reason to.

195
00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:09,880
So will you give me one?

196
00:09:10,662 --> 00:09:13,035
- Can I go back to crohn's disease?
- You already said no.

197
00:09:13,103 --> 00:09:15,497
- What else is there?
- Well you can't think of anything?

198
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:18,619
No, I'm usually so good on my feet.
Fuck, I need that hat.

199
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:20,951
Why?
What is so important about this hat?

200
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:25,403
Doc, in my line of work, you gotta do
everything you can to look young.

201
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:28,584
And since I dare not
stick a botox needle

202
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:31,565
in my face for fear of losing
my comic expressiveness,

203
00:09:32,286 --> 00:09:33,695
this hat is all I got.

204
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:37,672
You seem like an anxious person.
Is this a fair assessment?

205
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:41,097
Do you feel nervous
for no apparent reason?

206
00:09:41,865 --> 00:09:43,557
- Sometimes.
- Hyperventilating?

207
00:09:44,637 --> 00:09:46,264
I do have a history of panic attacks.

208
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:48,093
- Beautiful.
- I think it's hereditary.

209
00:09:48,168 --> 00:09:49,747
Well, go get yourself a hat.

210
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,095
And do yourself a favor,
while you're there,

211
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,900
pick up some nice chill weed
and smoke just a little.

212
00:09:56,188 --> 00:09:59,987
I think you're gonna find
your life just a tad more manageable.

213
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,482
Trust me.

214
00:10:04,115 --> 00:10:05,937
- Thank you, doc.
- You're welcome.

215
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,883
There is no fucking way
I'm apologizing to that jerkoff.

216
00:10:10,101 --> 00:10:11,994
- Forget it.
- I'm not asking you to apologize,

217
00:10:12,062 --> 00:10:13,599
- but you have to talk to him.
- Why?

218
00:10:13,624 --> 00:10:16,144
Why? Because he's our director
and we have a movie to finish.

219
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:18,257
I can finish the movie
without saying dick to him.

220
00:10:18,306 --> 00:10:19,728
He doesn't listen to me anyway.

221
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,060
- What about tonight?
- You go.

222
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:23,663
Elvis Mitchell doesn't care about me.

223
00:10:23,726 --> 00:10:26,358
The guy's trying to write a story
about three guys from New York

224
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:28,893
who made a movie, not two.
you understand?

225
00:10:28,943 --> 00:10:30,813
All right, I'll go.
But you better tell Walsh

226
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:33,041
not to fucking antagonize
me or it's gonna get ugly.

227
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:34,474
I'm serious.

228
00:10:36,729 --> 00:10:39,312
- She in?
- No, you cannot go in there, Mr. Gold.

229
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,640
How is the most fuckable
president of production in town?

230
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:43,948
Ari, get the fuck out.

231
00:10:44,118 --> 00:10:47,470
I brought cristal
and sprinkles cupcakes. Your favorite.

232
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:49,538
Or is it mine?
What's the difference?

233
00:10:49,643 --> 00:10:51,610
We used to eat everything
off each other anyway.

234
00:10:52,493 --> 00:10:54,069
I have to call you back.

235
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:56,005
What do you want?

236
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,396
Have you seen Vince's trailer?

237
00:10:57,511 --> 00:10:59,551
- I have. It's good.
- Oh, please.

238
00:10:59,907 --> 00:11:03,405
It's fucking great. Gonna be downloaded
more times than Britney's beaver shot.

239
00:11:03,491 --> 00:11:05,337
- Point?
- Point is I just left him.

240
00:11:05,837 --> 00:11:07,482
He loves <i>Lost in the Clouds</i> enough

241
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:09,910
to let you scoop him up before
every studio in town

242
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:11,392
begs for his services.

243
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:13,050
I'm telling you, Dana,

244
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,905
buy him today for half
of what you pay for him tomorrow.

245
00:11:15,995 --> 00:11:17,136
I can't.

246
00:11:17,563 --> 00:11:20,624
Dana, do not hold our personal
problems against Vince.

247
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,563
Vince would be great for this,
but Curtis Hanson is directing.

248
00:11:23,685 --> 00:11:25,036
- Vince loves Curtis.
- and,

249
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:27,073
we already have an offer out to someone.

250
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,864
- I hope to close today.
- Motherfucker.

251
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:30,395
- Who?
- Heath Ledger.

252
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,366
Sorry, Ari.

253
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:37,528
But this is good.

254
00:11:38,268 --> 00:11:41,617
Lay off the icing, Dana. Looks like
your hips could use a breather.

255
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,798
I need information on Heath Ledger.

256
00:11:50,992 --> 00:11:52,480
44-inch chest, aries,

257
00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:54,663
and he loves rainy days
and black-and-white movies.

258
00:11:54,731 --> 00:11:56,142
Who represents him, Lloyd?

259
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,137
Josh Weinstein.

260
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,655
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

261
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,022
Sorry, Ari, that was a reflex.

262
00:12:06,188 --> 00:12:07,754
This is gonna be easier than I thought.

263
00:12:08,058 --> 00:12:10,183
You have any queen
spies at the Weinstein office?

264
00:12:10,268 --> 00:12:12,649
I have spies at every office.
Doctors, lawyers...

265
00:12:12,724 --> 00:12:14,278
Find out where he's eating lunch today.

266
00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:17,199
- What are you up to?
- Sabotage, Lloyd. Agency 101.

267
00:12:17,454 --> 00:12:18,750
Oh, goody.

268
00:12:19,111 --> 00:12:21,055
We haven't had
a stealth adventure in a while.

269
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:23,483
You know I don't smoke weed
during the work season.

270
00:12:23,605 --> 00:12:26,420
You heard the doc. He said you're
nervous. You ought to try something.

271
00:12:26,493 --> 00:12:28,388
If you wanted weed,
why didn't you get a card?

272
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:30,295
I wanted to see
if something happened to you.

273
00:12:30,392 --> 00:12:33,369
Well, nothing did.
Check out that bad boy right there.

274
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:35,035
Impressive.
What's wrong with you?

275
00:12:35,438 --> 00:12:37,237
- Panic disorder.
- I'll buy that.

276
00:12:40,044 --> 00:12:41,234
Yo, where the hats at?

277
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,563
Hey, can I help you guys?

278
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:54,717
Yes, what's the largest
amount that one can legally...

279
00:12:54,838 --> 00:12:56,417
with the card, purshasse.

280
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,539
- How much do they need?
- Maybe 2 lbs.

281
00:12:59,701 --> 00:13:02,640
Listen, just give him the most
you can of the strongest you got.

282
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,604
Me, I'll take one jet-black
California homegrown trucker hat.

283
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,723
No bag necessary.
I'll be wearing it out.

284
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:16,437
Oh, yeah. Now I'm ready for work.

285
00:13:17,124 --> 00:13:18,338
Me too.

286
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,351
Vinnie, that little cunt-sucker
punched me, man,

287
00:13:22,483 --> 00:13:24,135
the biggest bitch move in the world.

288
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:26,126
Billy, you did scream
he likes to suck cock.

289
00:13:26,224 --> 00:13:29,363
I want that little undersized
douche in the ring anytime, anywhere.

290
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,039
Billy, this is getting ridiculous.

291
00:13:31,136 --> 00:13:33,723
No, what's ridiculous
is that one of the producers of our film

292
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:36,250
- seems intent on taking it down.
- Taking it down?

293
00:13:36,347 --> 00:13:38,290
The whole town
is freaking over the trailer.

294
00:13:38,436 --> 00:13:39,812
Yo, I wasn't ready yet.

295
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:42,266
Well, either way,
I'm telling you he did not leak it.

296
00:13:42,411 --> 00:13:44,615
Get him on a lie detector then.
I'll pay for the thing.

297
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:47,413
- Oh, Billy, come on.
- You don't doubt him even for a minute?

298
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,721
The guy tried to sell our movie
behind your back.

299
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,567
Billy, he's like my brother.

300
00:13:51,684 --> 00:13:54,897
I've known him since I'm six years old.
I have zero doubt.

301
00:13:55,116 --> 00:13:56,331
<i>You understand?</i>

302
00:13:57,308 --> 00:13:59,300
I do. You're a loyal guy,
and I respect that.

303
00:13:59,384 --> 00:14:01,425
So please respect
that I need you there tonight.

304
00:14:01,503 --> 00:14:03,526
And I need you
to get along during this interview

305
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:04,937
<i>for the sake of the movie.</i>

306
00:14:05,032 --> 00:14:07,558
Okay, Vince, for you and
for the movie, but you tell him,

307
00:14:07,655 --> 00:14:11,032
one look, one word, one smirk,
and he's going down hard.

308
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:12,594
I'll see you there.

309
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,871
it's all good. He understands
it's all about the movie.

310
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:18,374
- He's gonna be on his best behavior.
- Well, he better be.

311
00:14:22,716 --> 00:14:24,179
There he is.
there he is.

312
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:26,641
Keep the moistness out
of your pants, Lloyd, and just wait.

313
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,633
Let him see us.
Let him come to us, all right?

314
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:33,847
Hey, Ari, how are you?
What, we still got beef?

315
00:14:34,057 --> 00:14:37,215
No beef, Josh.
This is my assistant Lloyd.

316
00:14:37,969 --> 00:14:39,377
Josh used to be you, Lloyd.

317
00:14:40,682 --> 00:14:43,476
Josh Weinstein.
Ari's always yelling at me,

318
00:14:43,573 --> 00:14:46,302
"Lloyd, why can't you be
more like Josh Weinstein?"

319
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,207
Really? That's cool.

320
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:49,519
What are you up to, Josh?

321
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,724
Nothing much, man,
just working with Heath.

322
00:14:52,593 --> 00:14:54,767
- Ledger... I'm sure you've heard.
- I did not hear.

323
00:14:54,864 --> 00:14:57,318
No, but that's fantastic.
Terrific. I love Heath.

324
00:14:57,391 --> 00:14:59,520
Oh yeah. He's huge, and he's mine.

325
00:15:00,298 --> 00:15:01,963
Ari, you would have been so proud of me.

326
00:15:02,036 --> 00:15:03,324
It was just how you taught me.

327
00:15:03,421 --> 00:15:04,708
I was in a team ledger meeting,

328
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,939
Threw out a couple of suggestions...
Oh, did his point guy get pissed!

329
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,077
But Heath loved my ideas.

330
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,482
Now he only listens to what I say.

331
00:15:12,691 --> 00:15:14,489
Where are you steering him now, Josh?

332
00:15:14,596 --> 00:15:16,914
We're about to close
on <i>Lost in the Clouds</i>.

333
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:18,484
Really?

334
00:15:18,592 --> 00:15:19,976
Yeah, what? You don't like it?

335
00:15:20,025 --> 00:15:21,871
No no, you know,
I shouldn't say anything.

336
00:15:21,944 --> 00:15:24,835
Excuse me, miss,
could we be seated now? Thanks.

337
00:15:24,932 --> 00:15:26,760
- Right this way, Mr. Gold.
- All right.

338
00:15:27,003 --> 00:15:29,545
Are you just being a hater,
or you really got something to say?

339
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:31,536
Do you really want Heath
up on another mountain

340
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:33,066
playing gay again?
I mean, come on,

341
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:35,452
<i>Brokeback</i> is still in people's minds.

342
00:15:35,598 --> 00:15:36,836
Very much so.

343
00:15:38,051 --> 00:15:40,188
Gay?
What are you talking about?

344
00:15:40,261 --> 00:15:42,326
This is supposed to be
a badass mountain climber.

345
00:15:42,447 --> 00:15:43,710
Maybe.
Did you read the book?

346
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:46,211
I mean, there is a reason
why he chose the handsome sherpa

347
00:15:46,284 --> 00:15:49,031
who was educated at Oxford
to show him up the mountain.

348
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,664
I was thinking about
the Rock for the sherpa.

349
00:15:54,076 --> 00:15:56,770
There is an image. Look,
I don't mean to tell you your business,

350
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,879
but what do you think they were
doing in that cave for two weeks?

351
00:15:59,994 --> 00:16:02,447
They were using each other's asses
as hand warmers.

352
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:05,102
The love affair...
it's the subtext of the whole script,

353
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,118
even if it doesn't overtly
make the movie.

354
00:16:07,482 --> 00:16:10,412
I think Heath and the Rock
will make a hot couple.

355
00:16:10,694 --> 00:16:12,224
I wouldn't worry about it at all.

356
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,585
You've got my $10.50.

357
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,233
I gotta go call Heath.
Excuse me, guys.

358
00:16:17,306 --> 00:16:18,545
Sorry, guys.

359
00:16:19,763 --> 00:16:21,023
What do you think?

360
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:24,715
When you told me your plan,
I thought it was simple and stupid.

361
00:16:25,104 --> 00:16:27,076
- And now?
- Brilliant and complex.

362
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,180
There you go.
a couple of shots, huh, Lloyd?

363
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:30,807
Okay, Ari Gold, okay.

364
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:33,972
Excuse me, miss, can we get
a couple of Woo-Woos over here?

365
00:16:34,277 --> 00:16:35,810
What the fuck is a Woo-Woo?

366
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,224
- Hey, Johnny.
- Hey, gorgeous.

367
00:16:43,588 --> 00:16:46,770
- What up, playas?
- Looking good, Johnny Drama.

368
00:16:47,062 --> 00:16:50,184
Feeling good, J.J., feeling good.
Hey, Angela, how's it hanging, baby?

369
00:16:50,282 --> 00:16:51,739
Hey, Johnny.
How was your hiatus?

370
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:53,610
Any better...
I'd be guilty.

371
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,026
Gary! Yo!

372
00:16:57,265 --> 00:16:59,937
- Drama, what up, dawg?
- What up, biatches?

373
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,591
Johnny, what's up, man?
You look good.

374
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,109
You lose weight or what?

375
00:17:03,182 --> 00:17:06,254
Maybe a couple pounds. I've been
hitting the gym, doing two a day.

376
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:08,124
Nice. Hey, we should work out sometime.

377
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,542
If you think you can
keep up with my regimen.

378
00:17:11,635 --> 00:17:13,214
Yo, man, that's a sweet hat.

379
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:14,596
This little thing?

380
00:17:15,027 --> 00:17:16,898
- It's a'ight.
- A'ight? Dude, it's awesome.

381
00:17:17,432 --> 00:17:18,476
Killer, man.

382
00:17:18,525 --> 00:17:20,706
That's from that medical
marijuana joint, huh, Drama?

383
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:23,351
Dude, I hear
they got the illest og kush there.

384
00:17:23,448 --> 00:17:26,448
Let's just say membership
has its privileges.

385
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:27,937
Nice, Drama.

386
00:17:27,987 --> 00:17:30,626
Dude, you just turned this
into one very sweet new season.

387
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:32,205
- Yeah?
- Fuck yeah, dude.

388
00:17:32,313 --> 00:17:34,207
Yo, what the hell we waitin' for, boys?

389
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:36,151
Let's hit Drama's trailer, spark it up.

390
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:37,268
Come on.

391
00:17:38,368 --> 00:17:40,699
Don't even tell me
you didn't bring any for us.

392
00:17:41,285 --> 00:17:42,937
Of course I did. It's in the car.

393
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:46,615
- I'll go get it.
- All right!

394
00:17:47,772 --> 00:17:50,177
Dude, he's the man.
We're hooking up.

395
00:17:57,398 --> 00:17:58,661
Come on, Turtle, pick it up.

396
00:18:05,358 --> 00:18:06,767
Did you finish all my weed?

397
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,249
Nah, not all of it.

398
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,993
I need you on the set
with whatever's left, now.

399
00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:13,763
I'm not moving too fast, Drama.
this is some powerful shit.

400
00:18:13,957 --> 00:18:15,392
Now, Turtle, now!

401
00:18:19,252 --> 00:18:20,449
- Hey, Elvis.
- How are you?

402
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:23,367
Good to see you.
Haven't seen you since Sundance.

403
00:18:23,464 --> 00:18:24,921
- That's right.
- How have you been?

404
00:18:24,946 --> 00:18:26,185
- Very well. And you?
- Good.

405
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:28,258
This is my producer
and manager, Eric Murphy.

406
00:18:28,331 --> 00:18:29,738
- Nice to meet you.
- How are you?

407
00:18:29,787 --> 00:18:31,463
- Well. How are you?
- I'm good, thanks.

408
00:18:31,924 --> 00:18:33,722
And here's Mr. Walsh now.

409
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,147
Mr. Mitchell.

410
00:18:35,835 --> 00:18:37,536
- Pleasure to meet you.
- How are you?

411
00:18:38,938 --> 00:18:40,177
So, uh...

412
00:18:40,595 --> 00:18:43,005
How charming do we have to be
to get the cover?

413
00:18:46,274 --> 00:18:47,962
- Who told you, Ari?
- Told me what?

414
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:50,440
What are you talking about?
I was just calling to apologize.

415
00:18:50,513 --> 00:18:52,723
You know, I thought maybe
I was a little rude earlier.

416
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:54,739
Brian Grazer, how are you, man?
Good to see you.

417
00:18:54,788 --> 00:18:56,925
Listen, the real <i>American Gangster</i>.
Everything good?

418
00:18:56,998 --> 00:18:58,601
It's good,
but I'll see you in a while.

419
00:18:58,698 --> 00:19:00,933
Yes, you will. Can we put
Vinnie and Russell together?

420
00:19:01,743 --> 00:19:03,152
We will.
Dana, listen,

421
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,640
I know that deep down
my behavior really turns you on,

422
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:08,045
<i>but in case it really
doesn't, then yes, I am sorry.</i>

423
00:19:08,183 --> 00:19:10,879
Whatever.
Heath's off <i>Lost in the Clouds</i>.

424
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:13,636
- Really?
- <i>Yeah, it turns out</i>

425
00:19:13,743 --> 00:19:16,537
he's got some passion
project he wants to direct.

426
00:19:16,784 --> 00:19:19,602
A very interesting turn
of events out of nowhere.

427
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,973
<i>And an even stranger one
that I'm calling you now.</i>

428
00:19:22,143 --> 00:19:23,940
Well, you tell Curtis that Vinnie is in.

429
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:26,723
You know, I would love to,

430
00:19:26,891 --> 00:19:28,324
but Curtis is out.

431
00:19:29,186 --> 00:19:31,906
Wanted to only work with Heath
on this and no one else.

432
00:19:32,222 --> 00:19:34,009
Jesus.
So now what?

433
00:19:34,203 --> 00:19:37,094
So now my fast-track film
has hit the skids.

434
00:19:40,331 --> 00:19:42,687
Smoke smoke smoke!

435
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,309
Take it easy, Drama.
That shit's strong.

436
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,641
Hey, everyone,
Turtle here thinks he's my dad,

437
00:20:00,786 --> 00:20:02,414
thinks I should slow down.

438
00:20:02,511 --> 00:20:04,712
Don't worry, bro, he's cool.

439
00:20:05,586 --> 00:20:07,044
See, Turtle? I'm cool.

440
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,036
All right, I'm up.

441
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,389
- You just went, Drama.
- Just hit me, bitch.

442
00:20:11,764 --> 00:20:14,995
- It's not your turn, Drama.
- Just fucking hit me, man.

443
00:20:15,183 --> 00:20:16,737
You don't have any cards, Drama.

444
00:20:16,935 --> 00:20:19,583
Well, get me some
motherfucking cards then, son.

445
00:20:20,263 --> 00:20:21,793
All right, dawg.

446
00:20:25,723 --> 00:20:27,035
Hit me.

447
00:20:29,614 --> 00:20:30,804
Strip or smoke.

448
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:33,185
Well, there's no way
I'm taking these boxers off

449
00:20:33,306 --> 00:20:35,784
and humiliating
all the other men in here, so...

450
00:20:35,978 --> 00:20:37,048
I'll strip for you.

451
00:20:37,873 --> 00:20:39,064
I'll take that...

452
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,987
And I'll smoke.
Pack that shit tight.

453
00:20:43,434 --> 00:20:45,038
You're out of your mind, Drama.

454
00:20:45,284 --> 00:20:48,102
Smoke smoke smoke...

455
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,980
Are you okay, Drama?

456
00:21:06,408 --> 00:21:07,452
What?

457
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:08,910
Are you okay?

458
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:12,915
Why is everyone looking at me?

459
00:21:13,244 --> 00:21:14,604
'Cause you're talking.

460
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,641
- I'm not talking, you're talking.
- Relax, Drama.

461
00:21:17,716 --> 00:21:20,194
I can't relax.
My pulse is skyrocketing.

462
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,950
- Check my pulse.
- Oh shit, dude.

463
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:24,845
Someone is bugging out.

464
00:21:25,087 --> 00:21:27,565
I'm not bugging out. My mouth
is just dry. I need some water.

465
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:30,225
But out! Bug out! Bug out...

466
00:21:34,374 --> 00:21:36,510
I'm not bugging out.
Give me water.

467
00:21:36,765 --> 00:21:39,481
Someone get me some water.
Get me some water!

468
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:43,795
Turtle, why won't they help me?

469
00:21:45,991 --> 00:21:48,226
Why don't you just help
yourself and embrace it?

470
00:21:50,364 --> 00:21:51,675
Yeah, I'm bugging out.

471
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:54,495
I'm bugging out!

472
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:05,509
So we're standing
on the side of this mountain

473
00:22:05,582 --> 00:22:08,788
overlooking this place
that Pablo Escobar terrorized

474
00:22:08,934 --> 00:22:11,411
for over a decade,
and we're going,

475
00:22:12,051 --> 00:22:15,986
"what is the flaw in humanity
that makes people act so cruel?"

476
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:18,398
- Elvis, it was amazing.
- It was very inspiring.

477
00:22:18,978 --> 00:22:20,322
What did you think, Eric?

478
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,707
Oh, Eric wasn't there.

479
00:22:22,156 --> 00:22:24,172
I was at base camp
preparing for the next scene.

480
00:22:24,221 --> 00:22:25,921
Eric wasn't necessarily on set a lot.

481
00:22:25,994 --> 00:22:27,958
I was wherever I needed to be,
wherever that was.

482
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:31,631
Eric has the toughest job and he'll
probably get the least amount of credit.

483
00:22:31,825 --> 00:22:34,910
But he's the smallest so he doesn't
need as much credit as big people.

484
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:38,279
Then again,
my ego isn't half as big as Billy's.

485
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,611
Shit, Simon Cowell's ego
isn't as big.

486
00:22:41,536 --> 00:22:43,747
- You guys have an amazing rapport.
- Don't they?

487
00:22:43,941 --> 00:22:45,957
The three of you.
Did you all grow up together?

488
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,633
No, just me and E.

489
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:49,750
"Tiny E"...
that's our nickname for him.

490
00:22:50,085 --> 00:22:51,397
You can print that.

491
00:22:56,596 --> 00:22:57,665
Thanks again, guys.

492
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:58,880
Thank you.

493
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,872
- Good luck at Cannes.
- Thank you.

494
00:23:01,288 --> 00:23:04,247
- You fucking prick.
- Lick my balls, bitch.

495
00:23:04,465 --> 00:23:06,476
You want me to whip your ass again,
fucking hack?

496
00:23:06,524 --> 00:23:08,978
- Hack? Let's go, right here.
- Yeah, you're a fucking hack.

497
00:23:09,331 --> 00:23:11,153
Shut the fuck up!

498
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:12,794
Seriously.

499
00:23:13,071 --> 00:23:15,694
E, get in the fucking car. Go.

500
00:23:17,811 --> 00:23:19,702
- You'd better run, pussy.
- Run?

501
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:26,364
I'm sorry, man.
I just hate him.

502
00:23:27,376 --> 00:23:29,684
- Talk to you later, Billy.
- Don't be mad at me.

503
00:23:31,603 --> 00:23:34,514
Drive away now. Drive away
if you know what's good for you.

504
00:23:34,635 --> 00:23:36,530
- Are you fucking serious?
- Oh, what, it's me?

505
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,224
Walsh is a mess. I mean, look at him.
He's a crazy artist.

506
00:23:40,317 --> 00:23:41,338
You're not.

507
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:44,010
You're supposed to have your head
on your shoulders, right?

508
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,069
Right. No, you're right, Vince,
I'm sorry.

509
00:23:48,603 --> 00:23:49,988
But six more weeks and that's it.

510
00:23:50,158 --> 00:23:52,004
We finish posting this movie,
we go to Cannes,

511
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:54,322
and then I never see or speak
to this fuck again, ever.

512
00:23:54,395 --> 00:23:55,707
- Fine.
- Fine.

513
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:58,243
- Hey, what's up, Ari?

514
00:23:58,365 --> 00:24:00,211
Who wants to climb mount Annapurna?

515
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:02,106
- We got it?
- We got it.

516
00:24:02,293 --> 00:24:03,928
- That's sick.
- No, what's sick is

517
00:24:03,977 --> 00:24:06,296
I also got E on as a producer.

518
00:24:06,588 --> 00:24:07,972
- Nice.
- How did you do that?

519
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,377
By using the hype to sell
them the dream-team package.

520
00:24:10,523 --> 00:24:11,793
Oh yeah?
Who's the dream team?

521
00:24:11,891 --> 00:24:14,103
Team <i>Medellin</i>, baby.
Vinnie stars,

522
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,189
you produce, Walsh directs.

523
00:24:19,347 --> 00:24:20,951
Fuck me...
