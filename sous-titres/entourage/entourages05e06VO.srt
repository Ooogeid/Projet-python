00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,671
Golf on a wednesday?

4
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:08,638
In the next life
I want to come back as you.

5
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,336
Wish I could return the compliment,

6
00:02:10,456 --> 00:02:12,767
but I'd rather come back
as one of Michael Vick's dogs.

7
00:02:12,953 --> 00:02:14,644
Awesome.
So how's this golf game

8
00:02:14,764 --> 00:02:17,071
gonna get Vince in this movie
anyway, just so I'm clear?

9
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:19,851
Alan is a degenerate
gambler and he's awful.

10
00:02:20,062 --> 00:02:23,014
I used to take him for many dollars.
Today I am going to let him win.

11
00:02:23,134 --> 00:02:25,899
And then when he feels cocky
I'm gonna seize the moment.

12
00:02:26,285 --> 00:02:28,657
So you're gonna
bet Vince into the movie?

13
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:30,639
I'm feeling real confident now.

14
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:34,032
Your physical appearance has left
you no reason to ever feel confident.

15
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,241
<i>But sometimes you appear to be.</i>

16
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:38,763
Appear to be that way
for Vince today and who knows,

17
00:02:38,883 --> 00:02:42,385
maybe uncle Ari will deliver
a present by day's end.

18
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:44,513
- <i>Good luck, Ari</i>.
- Suck it, E.

19
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,501
I got a 9:30 call time.

20
00:02:48,347 --> 00:02:51,299
- You care if I roll with Drama?
- I just want you to be happy.

21
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,841
- Appreciate that.
- How those want ads looking?

22
00:02:54,046 --> 00:02:55,301
Depressing.

23
00:02:55,421 --> 00:02:58,219
You guys think I could sell
myself to old broads for cash?

24
00:02:58,339 --> 00:03:01,314
- If they have vision problems.
- You really don't have to get a job.

25
00:03:01,434 --> 00:03:04,187
Yeah, Vin, I really do.
I need a little cash in my pocket.

26
00:03:04,307 --> 00:03:06,287
You got your face to land pussy.
What do I got?

27
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:08,525
- A point.
- I got some cash I can give you.

28
00:03:08,777 --> 00:03:11,110
No way. I'm not taking anything
from you when you're hurting.

29
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,194
I appreciate it,
but I'm not hurting that bad.

30
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:14,550
Yeah, Vince, you are.

31
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,301
It's just temporary.
We all know you're gonna bounce back.

32
00:03:17,421 --> 00:03:19,503
Well, let's find you a job then.

33
00:03:20,638 --> 00:03:22,002
You have any ideas yet?

34
00:03:22,122 --> 00:03:24,211
Really just one
and it ain't in there.

35
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:25,383
What is it?

36
00:03:26,655 --> 00:03:29,000
You know Drama's been looking
to hire an assistant.

37
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,339
Since I go to work with the guy
half the time anyway...

38
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,762
- What do you think?
- That's not a bad idea.

39
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:37,418
- Why not keep I in the family?
- Could you bring it up to him?

40
00:03:37,538 --> 00:03:39,854
'cause I know if I do
he's gonna give me a hard time.

41
00:03:39,974 --> 00:03:41,810
- Sure.
- You ready to go?

42
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:44,936
- Hey, Johnny.
- Hey, bro.

43
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:47,021
How about hiring Turtle
as your assistant?

44
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,590
- I don't think so.
- Come on, Drama. It's only temporary.

45
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,526
- No way.
- Why not?

46
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:57,866
Because what I'm looking for
in an assistant you don't have.

47
00:03:58,026 --> 00:04:00,451
- And what's that?
- An ass I'd want to fuck.

48
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:02,183
- Please.
- You haven't hired one

49
00:04:02,303 --> 00:04:04,623
'cause you haven't found an ass
cheap enough to work for you.

50
00:04:04,743 --> 00:04:06,848
What's the going rate
for assistants nowadays?

51
00:04:06,968 --> 00:04:08,997
Other cast members
are paying around 700.

52
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:10,545
But I won't go over 250.

53
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,381
- Make it 300 cash and he's in.
- 300?

54
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,497
I'll get the rest back to you
when I get a job.

55
00:04:15,617 --> 00:04:17,468
- Sounds good.
- Not to me it don't.

56
00:04:17,786 --> 00:04:18,807
Come on.

57
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:21,095
Bro, he's never gonna
be able to handle the job.

58
00:04:21,215 --> 00:04:23,808
Please. I handle working for Vince,
I can handle working for you.

59
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:27,543
Working in fantasyland
don't qualify you to run Iraq.

60
00:04:27,663 --> 00:04:29,588
Whatever you need,
I will do, Drama.

61
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,875
I think that means if you
really want, you can fuck him.

62
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:34,686
- You're just on fire today.
- Come on, bro.

63
00:04:34,806 --> 00:04:36,895
There's no way
he's ever gonna listen to me.

64
00:04:37,015 --> 00:04:39,447
Do you promise to listen
to every word he says?

65
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:41,568
Cross my heart,
hope to die.

66
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,344
Stick a needle in your eye?

67
00:04:43,464 --> 00:04:46,194
And I'll take responsibility
for his performance.

68
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:49,981
All right, I'll try him out
for the day.

69
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:51,570
- Nice.
- Come on, let's go.

70
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,206
Do not disappoint me.

71
00:04:54,024 --> 00:04:55,742
Can I get an advance?

72
00:04:58,395 --> 00:04:59,895
So what are we gonna do today?

73
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:02,470
I have a pitch meeting
at the network with charlie.

74
00:05:03,865 --> 00:05:04,929
That's cool.

75
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,049
You could come.

76
00:05:08,605 --> 00:05:09,604
Nah.

77
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:11,408
- You sure?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:18,878 --> 00:05:20,323
I didn't do anything wrong.

79
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:22,423
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- Dom?

80
00:05:22,543 --> 00:05:25,828
- I'm really screwed.
- What's going on? What's wrong?

81
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:28,889
Turn on the news.

82
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:33,252
... involved
in a high-speed car Chase...

83
00:05:33,952 --> 00:05:35,588
Holy shit.
Dom, is that you?

84
00:05:35,748 --> 00:05:37,590
Yeah, it's me.
And I don't know what to do.

85
00:05:38,014 --> 00:05:40,802
Pull the fuck over.
Yo, E, get out here.

86
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,984
Jesus christ,
I'm done, Vin.

87
00:05:43,297 --> 00:05:44,374
I'm done.

88
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,975
- What's up?
- Dom.

89
00:05:48,636 --> 00:05:49,686
No fucking way!

90
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:54,899
- Out of the car!
- I'm coming.

91
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:56,905
- Show me your hands.
- I'm peaceful.

92
00:05:57,687 --> 00:05:59,196
I'm sorry, Vin. I love ya.

93
00:05:59,414 --> 00:06:01,580
<i>I'm sorry for anything
I ever did to you.</i>

94
00:06:02,917 --> 00:06:05,502
I think you're gonna want
to cancel your meeting.

95
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:13,937
Well...

96
00:06:14,455 --> 00:06:17,224
looking very nice.
Glad to see you still got your swing

97
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:19,569
so I'm not gonna feel too bad
taking all your money.

98
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:22,417
Only time you ever took my money
is when you fucked me on a deal, Alan.

99
00:06:22,537 --> 00:06:24,692
My game's improvedimmeasurably
over the last 10 years.

100
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:26,640
Today,
I'm gonna fuck you on the course.

101
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,058
I look forward to that. Just like
the old days when we were nobodies.

102
00:06:32,146 --> 00:06:34,056
- How are you, bob?
- How are you?

103
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:35,725
Good to see you.
Everything good?

104
00:06:35,845 --> 00:06:38,262
Yeah, I was supposed to play
a round with Pete Bogdanovich.

105
00:06:38,382 --> 00:06:41,237
He had an emergency, he didn't show up.
So figured I'd just come and

106
00:06:41,397 --> 00:06:43,009
whack a few balls before I go home.

107
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:45,525
At your age, that you
can whack anything is a miracle.

108
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:48,286
Always too clever for your own good.

109
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:50,199
You're right about that, bob.

110
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:52,600
Wait a minute.

111
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,154
You annoy Ari.

112
00:06:54,645 --> 00:06:55,981
Why don't you join us?

113
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:58,777
You can talk to me about that picture
you've been trying to get me to make.

114
00:06:58,897 --> 00:07:00,798
- What, the Ramones picture?
- Sure thing.

115
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,219
- It's not dead?
- Nothing's ever dead in this town.

116
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,374
You're living proof of that, Bob.

117
00:07:08,216 --> 00:07:09,557
That's terrific news.

118
00:07:10,018 --> 00:07:12,727
Slide in, I'll ride with you.
Sorry. You ride with Ari.

119
00:07:13,227 --> 00:07:15,104
I brought my pro today
to keep me in line.

120
00:07:15,264 --> 00:07:17,100
- You brought your pro?
- I sure did.

121
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,916
In fact, here he is.

122
00:07:19,036 --> 00:07:20,171
Hey, partner.

123
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,446
Is this whose ass
we're gonna kick today?

124
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,896
- Ari Gold.
- Phil Mickelson.

125
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,254
The day starts when I say it starts.

126
00:07:33,374 --> 00:07:35,156
The day ends when I say it ends.

127
00:07:35,276 --> 00:07:36,552
Got you, boss.

128
00:07:36,672 --> 00:07:38,669
No weed smoking,
no boozing.

129
00:07:40,588 --> 00:07:42,196
What's up, Jimmy?
How are you?

130
00:07:42,316 --> 00:07:44,297
- And no cavorting.
- I was just being polite.

131
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:47,262
Don't be. The real reason
I haven't hired an assistant

132
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:50,038
is because I haven't found anyone
who could match my intensity,

133
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:52,954
- especially while I'm creating.
- I will match it.

134
00:07:53,227 --> 00:07:55,300
- Here you go.
- We'll see.

135
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:59,881
I'm gonna need you to get me breakfast
while I look at my sides.

136
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,583
No problem.
What do you want?

137
00:08:01,703 --> 00:08:03,861
- Fibercon raisin.
- Done.

138
00:08:04,021 --> 00:08:07,657
Wait. That's fibercon cereal
with raisins added.

139
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:10,136
- Gotcha.
- But,

140
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:13,037
I want the raisons added
from the raisin bran box.

141
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:15,323
I don't understand.

142
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:17,177
Pour a bowl of fibercon,

143
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:18,688
open up a box of raisin bran,

144
00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:21,003
grab 20 or 30 raisins
out of it.

145
00:08:21,615 --> 00:08:24,751
Also I need half-orange-juice-
Half-apple-juice

146
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,906
in a coffee mug
with a splash of v8.

147
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:30,138
And paper-thin banana slices,
about an eighth of an inch thick.

148
00:08:30,298 --> 00:08:32,557
How am I supposed to know
if they're an eighth of an inch?

149
00:08:32,677 --> 00:08:34,353
You should be able
to see through them.

150
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:35,643
You're fucking with me?

151
00:08:35,803 --> 00:08:38,146
You gonna question
everything I ask today?

152
00:08:38,422 --> 00:08:40,940
- 'Cause I'll tell Vince.
- You don't have to tell Vince anything.

153
00:08:41,524 --> 00:08:44,087
Don't make me.
Now go, on the hop.

154
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,327
You know how angry I get
when my blood sugar drops.

155
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:53,017
You're gonna have to call a cab
and meet me there.

156
00:08:53,137 --> 00:08:55,069
I can't believe
you're doing this to me again.

157
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:57,238
You know I wanted to go
over the pitch before, right?

158
00:08:57,358 --> 00:08:59,834
- I've got to meet you there.
- All right, you can go in now.

159
00:08:59,994 --> 00:09:01,878
The meeting starts
in less than two hours

160
00:09:02,038 --> 00:09:04,245
and you're always
ditching me for Vince.

161
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:07,300
I'm sorry. But I got to go.
I will be there.

162
00:09:07,702 --> 00:09:10,388
- <i>I'll see you in a little while.</i>
- Yeah, okay.

163
00:09:11,162 --> 00:09:14,348
- You've got to get me out of here.
- Calm down. Tell us what happened?

164
00:09:14,665 --> 00:09:17,018
Nothing did.
I panicked is all.

165
00:09:17,178 --> 00:09:18,526
Panicked from what?

166
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,675
Maybe I was speeding.
I don't know.

167
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:22,912
But a cop pulled up
behind me.

168
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:25,471
I thought I had weed
in the glovebox.

169
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,697
It's my mother-in-law's.
It's not mine. She's got glaucoma.

170
00:09:30,484 --> 00:09:33,541
But since I've been out here
I got a couple of strikes

171
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:35,870
and the fear just kicked in
and I ran.

172
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,206
- So you didn't do anything?
- Nothing.

173
00:09:38,603 --> 00:09:41,417
But if they charge me
with evading I'm looking at 30 years.

174
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:44,629
- Jesus, Dom.
- You've got to get me out of here.

175
00:09:45,073 --> 00:09:48,293
What do you want us to do?
Want us to overtake the guards?

176
00:09:48,893 --> 00:09:50,312
- Sorry.
- No.

177
00:09:50,775 --> 00:09:52,137
I deserved that.

178
00:09:52,756 --> 00:09:55,763
But here's the thing--
I've changed.

179
00:09:55,966 --> 00:09:57,099
For real this time.

180
00:09:57,259 --> 00:10:00,091
I got a...
four-month-old baby girl.

181
00:10:01,127 --> 00:10:03,898
I got the love of a beautiful
oriental woman.

182
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:06,067
I got a limo business.

183
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:09,954
I go to church.
But I need to get out of here

184
00:10:10,074 --> 00:10:12,823
so I can look my girl in the face
and tell her I'm sorry.

185
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,994
- What do we have to do?
- Post bail.

186
00:10:19,372 --> 00:10:20,915
I know it's a lot to ask.

187
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:24,085
But I swear to my mother,
who you know and love,

188
00:10:24,593 --> 00:10:26,921
that I just need to go see
my girl and my baby

189
00:10:27,204 --> 00:10:30,174
and I'll come right back here
and you'll get your money back.

190
00:10:32,868 --> 00:10:34,929
- How much is your bail?
- 100 grand.

191
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:38,856
Fuck that.

192
00:10:38,976 --> 00:10:40,901
- You've grown cold.
- Oh, come on.

193
00:10:41,021 --> 00:10:42,701
Hollywood has made you cold.

194
00:10:42,821 --> 00:10:44,978
- You buying any of that nonsense?
- What nonsense?

195
00:10:45,098 --> 00:10:47,581
Thought he had weed in his car
and his mother-in-law has glaucoma.

196
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:49,694
- Why would he lie?
- 'Cause he's an arch-criminal.

197
00:10:49,814 --> 00:10:51,969
- He lies about everything.
- I have to get him out.

198
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:53,548
So he can run and lose the money?

199
00:10:53,668 --> 00:10:55,807
- He has a baby, he's not gonna run.
- How do you know?

200
00:10:55,927 --> 00:10:57,347
You think he's lying about that?

201
00:10:57,467 --> 00:10:59,653
You think there's someone out there
that would fuck him?

202
00:10:59,773 --> 00:11:02,030
I don't care. I have to get him out.
If he runs, it's on me.

203
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,745
- And the 100 grand?
- That's on you.

204
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:06,009
For now, I mean,
if you have it.

205
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:08,600
I really hate to ask,
but if you have it I'd appreciate.

206
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,463
- Do you have it?
- Why do you always believe in him?

207
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:14,213
Why do you always believe in me?
Instinct.

208
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:16,264
I've known Dom for 25 years

209
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,734
and my instinct says one day
he's gonna redeem himself.

210
00:11:18,854 --> 00:11:20,891
Yeah, well,
I hope that day is today.

211
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:23,887
Think there's a B of A around here?

212
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,856
Hold on.
You're aimed over here.

213
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:28,935
- Really?
- Really.

214
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,063
Aim here.

215
00:11:31,963 --> 00:11:33,520
Thank you, Phil.

216
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:40,161
- Am I hot or what?
- En fuego, Alan. En fuego.

217
00:11:41,863 --> 00:11:43,963
- I've got this idea.
- Freak.

218
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,501
After we do the Ramones picture,
I got this great golf script.

219
00:11:47,865 --> 00:11:51,473
This aging pro falls in love with
his caddy and all hell breaks loose.

220
00:11:51,593 --> 00:11:53,663
Now is that something you
might be interested in?

221
00:11:53,783 --> 00:11:56,165
I could be, Bob.
I could be.

222
00:11:56,601 --> 00:11:59,722
If I keep beating Ari like this we could
be buying the script with his cash.

223
00:11:59,882 --> 00:12:02,530
After I sink this putt,
it's just the beginning of my comeback.

224
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,478
You've lost the last eight holes.
When you miss I'm up 10 grand.

225
00:12:05,638 --> 00:12:08,856
- I don't Miss putts inside 10 feet.
- Even bob knows that.

226
00:12:09,016 --> 00:12:10,231
How would I know that?

227
00:12:10,351 --> 00:12:12,860
The only putz I see
is standing in front of me.

228
00:12:13,144 --> 00:12:14,262
Good one, bob.

229
00:12:14,382 --> 00:12:16,697
I'm surprised you can hold the club
with those slick hands.

230
00:12:17,044 --> 00:12:20,534
- You got grease running down your arms.
- Get your point there.

231
00:12:20,694 --> 00:12:22,745
- Let him play, Bob.
- Sorry.

232
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:25,206
My bad.

233
00:12:28,865 --> 00:12:30,311
Miss it, you scumbag!

234
00:12:31,388 --> 00:12:32,880
You guys are hysterical.

235
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,359
You come right here
and say your line.

236
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,370
Then brandon comes
from up here and says...

237
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,347
- What are you, stupid?
- Great. Let's shoot it.

238
00:12:42,086 --> 00:12:44,159
Hold on a second.
Here's my guy.

239
00:12:44,623 --> 00:12:47,817
Finally.
He's mine, Casey, let him go.

240
00:12:47,937 --> 00:12:49,017
All right.

241
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:52,794
- Where you been?
- Slicing bananas.

242
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:55,931
Which wasn't easy to do with
a plastic knife. I did good, right?

243
00:12:56,749 --> 00:12:58,813
Too slow,
but you did all right.

244
00:12:59,177 --> 00:13:00,783
Johnny, let's go.

245
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:03,357
Hold on a second.
I'm running on fumes.

246
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,957
- What's this?
- What?

247
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,418
- These aren't raisin bran raisins.
- Yeah they are.

248
00:13:10,578 --> 00:13:12,169
Do you think I'm stupid?

249
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:14,004
What's that got to do
with anything?

250
00:13:14,164 --> 00:13:16,171
There's no sugar coating
on these raisins.

251
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,325
The milk probably
washed it off.

252
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,471
These are sun-maid raisins.
Don't fuck with my palate.

253
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:24,393
- Any time now.
- Hold on a second.

254
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:27,893
- I'm calling Vince.
- No, fine. They ran out of raisin bran.

255
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:30,649
- So you couldn't run to 7-11?
- I didn't think I had enough time.

256
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,616
No, you didn't think. And your
not thinking doesn't get me what I want.

257
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:35,825
And when I don't get
what I want my day is done.

258
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:38,925
- I'm sorry, Drama.
- Well, sorry dora fill my belly.

259
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:42,408
What else can I do?

260
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,466
All this.

261
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:48,457
Go.

262
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:51,648
Jesus.
I thought Brandon was an asshole.

263
00:13:51,768 --> 00:13:54,283
Yeah, Drama's in a class
all by himself.

264
00:13:54,403 --> 00:13:56,380
Sorry, I've got an idiot
for an assistant.

265
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:58,810
They all have their days.

266
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,705
That's why I put a Xanax
in Brandon's coffee every morning.

267
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:04,430
- Come on.
- Oh yeah, look how relaxed he is.

268
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,601
A happy boss
means a happy assistant.

269
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,683
Find a way. Trust me,
you'll have much less work to do.

270
00:14:12,126 --> 00:14:14,008
Why couldn't you drop me
off at home first?

271
00:14:14,128 --> 00:14:15,372
I'm late for this meeting.

272
00:14:15,492 --> 00:14:18,208
- I kinda got to get home.
- I'm gonna get you home.

273
00:14:18,328 --> 00:14:21,006
The whole point of bailing me out
is 'cause you knew I needed to get home.

274
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,420
I'm late. I couldn't drop you.
We're gonna be done soon.

275
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,992
Please, just stick close to me.

276
00:14:25,356 --> 00:14:27,511
- Stick close to you?
- Yeah.

277
00:14:27,946 --> 00:14:29,997
- Oh, look here.
- Sorry, Charlie.

278
00:14:30,157 --> 00:14:31,847
We're just gonna walk right in.

279
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:34,668
Oh hey. I want you to meet
my running-late manager.

280
00:14:35,037 --> 00:14:36,911
- This is Eric murphy.
- How are you?

281
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:38,960
- Vincent Chase.
- Oh, hi.

282
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:41,926
Hey, Amy Miller.
Will you be joining us?

283
00:14:42,156 --> 00:14:44,204
Everybody is.
We're all coming in.

284
00:14:44,324 --> 00:14:45,679
I'm coming in?

285
00:14:46,657 --> 00:14:48,975
- Please.
- Why the fuck am I coming in?

286
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:50,530
Sorry about that.

287
00:14:51,694 --> 00:14:52,686
So...

288
00:14:55,641 --> 00:14:57,441
Are you involved with this project?

289
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:00,190
I'm involved
with the management company.

290
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,237
I'm here to put my support
behind Charlie.

291
00:15:02,831 --> 00:15:05,313
Great. Charlie, we can't wait
to hear what your ideas are.

292
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:07,508
I loved what you did
at the comedy store.

293
00:15:07,628 --> 00:15:09,150
I appreciate that. Thanks a lot.

294
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,289
We think Charlie's gonna be
the next Chris Rock.

295
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:13,721
Me personally, I think I'm more
of a Steve Martin kind of guy,

296
00:15:13,841 --> 00:15:15,251
but way to use the race card.

297
00:15:15,543 --> 00:15:16,835
Oh, I get it.

298
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:20,130
So anyway,
what's the idea?

299
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,675
- E's gonna intro the premise.
- Excuse me.

300
00:15:23,144 --> 00:15:26,359
Before you guys get started,
I just need to use the toilet.

301
00:15:32,086 --> 00:15:34,247
It's about--
It's about skate kids

302
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,704
down by the beach.
It's called <i>Venice</i>.

303
00:15:38,778 --> 00:15:41,369
You know what?
I need to use the bathroom too.

304
00:15:41,489 --> 00:15:43,571
I will be--
I'll be right back.

305
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:48,556
Two minutes.

306
00:15:54,066 --> 00:15:55,499
Vince is my new manager.

307
00:15:58,212 --> 00:16:01,295
- I thought you had to be in there.
- No, Charlie's got it under control.

308
00:16:01,415 --> 00:16:03,844
- Seems like a nice kid.
- Oh yeah.

309
00:16:07,188 --> 00:16:09,637
- So you gonna piss or what?
- I'm pissing.

310
00:16:13,227 --> 00:16:14,720
Silent stream, huh?

311
00:16:17,972 --> 00:16:19,023
Meeting's over?

312
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,775
Just like when you fuck,
quick and straight to the point.

313
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,945
- What did she say?
- It's a done deal. She wants a script.

314
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:27,898
- Wow, that was fast.
- The kid's funny.

315
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,784
That and Vince agreed
to do the pilot.

316
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,700
Congratulations, guys.
I must be a lucky charm.

317
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:37,237
What do you say?
You want to just call it a day?

318
00:16:37,357 --> 00:16:39,378
You want to let me off
on the 20 grand I owe you?

319
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,878
Otherwise we play through.

320
00:16:40,998 --> 00:16:42,819
You could go down
a lot more if you go on.

321
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:44,510
Yeah, I don't think so, Phil. No.

322
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,041
'cause I'm just starting
to get loose, all right?

323
00:16:47,161 --> 00:16:50,305
I get stronger by the hole
whereas Alan always gets weaker.

324
00:16:50,425 --> 00:16:51,614
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

325
00:16:51,734 --> 00:16:54,282
Maybe you should raise
the stakes a little.

326
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,144
That's a good idea, Bob.
I have a lot of good ideas.

327
00:16:58,064 --> 00:17:00,272
I don't play for money.
I play for personal pride.

328
00:17:00,592 --> 00:17:02,108
What, are you a pussy?

329
00:17:02,228 --> 00:17:05,003
- Alan, you're up 20 grand.
- And I'm bored.

330
00:17:05,193 --> 00:17:07,048
All right,
what do you want to play for?

331
00:17:07,168 --> 00:17:09,469
Well, how's 20 a hole sound?

332
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:12,758
I don't know.

333
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:14,283
Too rich for your blood?

334
00:17:14,403 --> 00:17:17,528
I don't know what kind of profits
that little agency of yours is turning.

335
00:17:17,648 --> 00:17:18,660
If any.

336
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:20,869
I'll tell you what.

337
00:17:21,878 --> 00:17:24,746
Why don't we play for 50 a hole?
But I don't want your money.

338
00:17:25,457 --> 00:17:26,692
What do you want?

339
00:17:27,737 --> 00:17:29,301
I want Vinnie in the movie.

340
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:33,073
- You swore you wouldn't bring that up.
- I didn't know you'd be so competitive.

341
00:17:33,193 --> 00:17:36,684
You really are a scumbag.
I told you, Alan. I know these things.

342
00:17:37,331 --> 00:17:39,269
Listen, it's the second lead.

343
00:17:39,448 --> 00:17:42,356
Whatever it is, doesn't matter 'cause
you'll never win. Go ahead, swing away.

344
00:17:56,488 --> 00:17:59,081
- Nice drive.
- Best of the day.

345
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:00,618
Finally.

346
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:04,586
- Have you been hustling me, Ari?
- I'm sure he has been.

347
00:18:04,795 --> 00:18:08,298
You got phil fucking
mickelson teaching you

348
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:11,468
and this idiot yammering in my ear
all day and I'm hustling you?

349
00:18:12,062 --> 00:18:13,925
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna focus

350
00:18:14,045 --> 00:18:15,797
extra extra hard
from now on, Alan.

351
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:17,391
Me too, me too.

352
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,269
We stopped playing together,
what was it, 10 years ago now, right?

353
00:18:21,515 --> 00:18:23,223
That's about when I met Phil.

354
00:18:23,422 --> 00:18:25,358
He saw a real flaw in my game.

355
00:18:25,693 --> 00:18:27,332
Got me to fix it, though.

356
00:18:27,752 --> 00:18:29,903
But actually, I haven't
used his advice today.

357
00:18:30,063 --> 00:18:32,281
Didn't seem to need it until now.

358
00:18:33,637 --> 00:18:35,075
What advice did he give you?

359
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:38,037
Like me, he's better as a lefty.

360
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:40,972
Thank you, phil.

361
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:44,108
Are you in trouble now.

362
00:18:51,617 --> 00:18:54,208
Big trouble, Ari.
Big trouble.

363
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,305
Will you just die already, Bob?

364
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,869
What's up, boss?

365
00:19:02,989 --> 00:19:05,282
- How'd you get back so fast?
- Good shoes.

366
00:19:05,402 --> 00:19:07,424
Seriously.
You do everything on the list?

367
00:19:07,544 --> 00:19:10,430
- Not everything.
- You get my dry cleaning?

368
00:19:11,002 --> 00:19:13,402
Did you get my picture
from the framing store?

369
00:19:13,522 --> 00:19:16,337
Did you get my Peter Thomas Roth
anti-aging cleansing gel?

370
00:19:16,457 --> 00:19:18,791
- I did not.
- What did you get me?

371
00:19:19,064 --> 00:19:20,018
This.

372
00:19:23,315 --> 00:19:24,792
- Who's that?
- It's an extra.

373
00:19:24,952 --> 00:19:26,531
You're her favorite character.

374
00:19:26,651 --> 00:19:29,254
- What am I supposed to do with her?
- Fuck her. What do you think?

375
00:19:29,724 --> 00:19:32,174
You think I need you
to pick up extras for me to bang?

376
00:19:32,429 --> 00:19:35,592
I did have to charm about 20 of them
before I found one that would say yes.

377
00:19:35,712 --> 00:19:37,119
Do you know how stupid this is?

378
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:39,219
- I thought it'd make you happy.
- It doesn't.

379
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:41,141
I can't have an extra in my trailer.

380
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:43,890
I got sexual harassment lawsuits
coming out of my ass as it is.

381
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,480
- I never heard about those.
- I don't tell you everything.

382
00:19:46,941 --> 00:19:48,990
You said you wanted
an assistant you could bang.

383
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,784
Because you pay an assistant
to keep her mouth shut.

384
00:19:51,904 --> 00:19:54,629
These girls are just jerking
their way to a lawsuit.

385
00:19:54,749 --> 00:19:56,767
Between this
and my meltdown on <i>The View</i>

386
00:19:56,887 --> 00:19:58,666
you could get me
thrown off the show.

387
00:19:59,022 --> 00:20:00,735
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, me too--

388
00:20:00,855 --> 00:20:02,432
For agreeing to this.

389
00:20:02,963 --> 00:20:04,998
Get her out of here quietly.

390
00:20:05,793 --> 00:20:07,538
Then go wait in the car.

391
00:20:11,229 --> 00:20:12,674
Anybody home?

392
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,016
I don't think anybody's here.

393
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:18,419
I thought you were in such a rush
'cause they were waiting.

394
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:21,150
- They must have stepp out for a minute.
- You want to call them?

395
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,796
I'm sure they'll be back any minute.
You want something to drink?

396
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,623
- What do you got?
- Name it, I got it.

397
00:20:25,743 --> 00:20:27,750
- A beer.
- Yeah, me too.

398
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,446
- E, why so close?
- What?

399
00:20:30,883 --> 00:20:33,301
I feel like you're about
to attempt a prison rape.

400
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:35,012
- What's up?
- Nothing.

401
00:20:35,132 --> 00:20:37,985
- What's up, Vin?
- E thinks you're gonna jump bail.

402
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,534
Come on, you think that?

403
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,620
You did try to outrun
a bunch of police officers.

404
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,713
I thought I explained that
to you sufficiently.

405
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,312
He doubts you.

406
00:20:47,694 --> 00:20:49,884
So that's why you followed
me to take a piss.

407
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,220
He really looks after
your money, huh?

408
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,382
- Actually, it's his money.
- I've hit a bit of a rough patch.

409
00:20:57,478 --> 00:20:58,919
You put up the money, E?

410
00:21:00,622 --> 00:21:03,599
After all I've done--
I expected Vince to come through,

411
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:05,559
but E doing that,
that means a lot.

412
00:21:06,026 --> 00:21:08,145
Just put his mind at ease
that you're not gonna run.

413
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:10,914
I'm a little more likely to
since it's not your money.

414
00:21:12,253 --> 00:21:14,299
Be at ease.
'cause, come on,

415
00:21:15,185 --> 00:21:18,239
do you think if I decided to run
you'd be able to stop me?

416
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,751
Oh shit, that's them.

417
00:21:24,095 --> 00:21:26,997
Don't say a word about this.
I got to wait for the right moment.

418
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:29,465
I'm not gonna say anything.

419
00:21:29,585 --> 00:21:31,432
There are my two beauties.

420
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,581
Come here, my little izzybear.

421
00:21:36,022 --> 00:21:38,685
- I tried calling you.
- I'm sorry, phone was on the fritz.

422
00:21:39,293 --> 00:21:40,775
There's a baby.

423
00:21:40,895 --> 00:21:42,204
Careful, ma.

424
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:45,072
And a blind mother-in-law.

425
00:21:47,854 --> 00:21:50,308
Sylvi, these are my friends.

426
00:21:51,147 --> 00:21:53,815
- Hey, this is my mother.
- Hi.

427
00:21:54,294 --> 00:21:56,109
- And Vince?
- Yes, hi.

428
00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:57,945
How are you?
And you're E?

429
00:21:58,118 --> 00:21:59,354
How'd you know that?

430
00:21:59,474 --> 00:22:02,257
Dom showed me so many pictures
of you guys when you were children.

431
00:22:02,377 --> 00:22:05,494
- Really?
- I'm so glad to see you all together.

432
00:22:05,812 --> 00:22:08,198
I know how angry you were
after what he did.

433
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:11,532
- Dom told you about that?
- He tells me everything.

434
00:22:11,652 --> 00:22:13,801
We made a pact
before we had little Izzy.

435
00:22:13,921 --> 00:22:14,950
Ma.

436
00:22:16,606 --> 00:22:18,298
Careful up the steps.

437
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,878
Easy.

438
00:22:22,971 --> 00:22:24,362
Dom's a dad.

439
00:22:26,008 --> 00:22:28,767
- Can you believe he's the best dad?
- Unbelievable.

440
00:22:31,031 --> 00:22:32,204
He is.

441
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,424
Ma.

442
00:22:38,756 --> 00:22:40,612
- Who is this?
- Say hi.

443
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:43,856
I'm uncle Vince.

444
00:22:47,654 --> 00:22:49,470
- You got this one, Alan.
- Are you sure?

445
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,691
No doubt.

446
00:22:57,639 --> 00:22:58,885
Your move, Ari.

447
00:22:59,005 --> 00:23:01,112
Etiquette.
Farthest guy out goes first.

448
00:23:01,585 --> 00:23:03,552
You've got to cup this one to tie.

449
00:23:03,712 --> 00:23:06,090
- It's not an easy shot.
- No shit, Bob.

450
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,690
- Any advice there, Phil?
- Pray, Ari.

451
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:13,103
Don't bother. I'm sure God
gave up on you a long time ago.

452
00:23:21,188 --> 00:23:22,515
I'm so sorry.

453
00:23:23,006 --> 00:23:25,449
So sorry to you and Mr. Chase.

454
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:28,509
You know, you really are a fucking
gutless prick. You know that, Ari?

455
00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:29,814
Oh well.

456
00:23:30,322 --> 00:23:32,487
I'll tell you what--
I'll tell you what.

457
00:23:37,128 --> 00:23:38,765
- Make that.
- What?

458
00:23:40,101 --> 00:23:43,675
One more shot for your
favorite pretty boy client.

459
00:23:43,865 --> 00:23:45,844
Go ahead, make it.
Show me you got some guts.

460
00:23:46,404 --> 00:23:49,158
Make the putt and he's in
and you're the hero.

461
00:23:49,786 --> 00:23:52,184
You Miss it
and you're both losers.

462
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,110
Oh well. You know what?
Fuck both of you, Ari.

463
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,278
You hear me?
Fuck you both.

464
00:24:15,398 --> 00:24:17,330
I lost,.
Why are you so angry?

465
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,976
I'm so angry 'cause
I don't fucking like you.

466
00:24:20,096 --> 00:24:21,798
And I don't like that fucking kid.

467
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:25,527
And you come out here when I tell you
not to bring up his fucking name again

468
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:28,095
- and you ruin my fucking day.
- Calm down.

469
00:24:28,255 --> 00:24:31,223
Don't you ever tell me
to calm down! You hear me?

470
00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:33,983
Don't you ever fucking
tell me to calm down,

471
00:24:34,103 --> 00:24:36,269
you fucking prick cocksucker!

472
00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:42,776
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.

473
00:24:43,318 --> 00:24:44,528
Alan, are you okay?

474
00:24:44,973 --> 00:24:47,781
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm-- I'm fucking fine.

475
00:24:50,098 --> 00:24:52,786
Nice fucking relaxing day, huh?

476
00:24:52,946 --> 00:24:55,063
- Take a seat, Aan.
- I'm fine. I said I'm--

477
00:24:55,183 --> 00:24:56,915
- Oh fuck!
- You all right?

478
00:24:57,385 --> 00:24:59,434
- I said I'm fine!
- Call 911 fast.

479
00:24:59,554 --> 00:25:01,586
- I'm gonna call a doctor.
- Oh god.

480
00:25:01,746 --> 00:25:03,582
Somebody call a doctor!

481
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:08,367
Come on, Alan.
Think positive thoughts.

482
00:25:15,425 --> 00:25:17,525
- What's this?
- Got the list done.

483
00:25:18,315 --> 00:25:20,526
- The whole list?
- Everything. And,

484
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:23,382
highlighted your sides for tomorrow.

485
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,628
Thanks.

486
00:25:30,985 --> 00:25:33,618
- Look, I was hard on you today.
- You think?

487
00:25:34,457 --> 00:25:36,390
Most guys would be thrilled
to see a girl

488
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,498
in her underwear
sitting in their trailer,

489
00:25:38,618 --> 00:25:41,228
- but I'm not like most.
- No, you are not.

490
00:25:42,553 --> 00:25:45,172
Anyway, you proved something
to me right now.

491
00:25:45,685 --> 00:25:48,845
More importantly, I think you
proved something to yourself.

492
00:25:49,505 --> 00:25:51,344
You think this is a job
you want to keep?

493
00:25:51,655 --> 00:25:53,087
Why, you want to keep me?

494
00:25:53,436 --> 00:25:57,225
I mean, you were rough in patches,
but I think you could grow into it.

495
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,021
- You gonna tell Vince I did good?
- I already did, on the phone.

496
00:26:01,244 --> 00:26:02,864
Even before I did all this?

497
00:26:03,357 --> 00:26:06,604
I'll bury you at work
but never to the outside world.

498
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,333
I'm gonna toughen you up, though.

499
00:26:10,015 --> 00:26:12,240
- That sound good?
- Is the day officially over?

500
00:26:12,816 --> 00:26:14,289
Then it sounds great.

501
00:26:17,258 --> 00:26:19,289
You're not gonna get the door for me?

502
00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:22,667
- What are you doing?
- Telling you I quit, you jerkoff.

503
00:26:23,604 --> 00:26:24,671
What?

504
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:31,110
He's coming back.

505
00:26:33,982 --> 00:26:35,388
He's coming back.

506
00:26:36,021 --> 00:26:37,466
Everything was amazing, Sylvi.

507
00:26:37,586 --> 00:26:39,834
- Truly incredible. Thank you.
- It's my pleasure.

508
00:26:39,954 --> 00:26:40,977
My pleasure.

509
00:26:41,368 --> 00:26:43,438
- Thanks, babe.
- I'll be back.

510
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:49,275
I don't know how I'm gonna tell her.

511
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,404
Just be honest.

512
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,083
It's gonna break her heart.

513
00:26:55,876 --> 00:26:57,369
She don't deserve it.

514
00:27:01,156 --> 00:27:02,983
I love you guys for being here.

515
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:05,095
I really do.

516
00:27:06,288 --> 00:27:07,170
Say bye.

517
00:27:10,924 --> 00:27:12,467
Do you feel guilty now?

518
00:27:13,377 --> 00:27:15,053
Maybe he's changed a little.

519
00:27:15,716 --> 00:27:19,098
Third grade when Nikey Cammerata
tried to kick your ass...

520
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:21,240
- Yup.
- ... who stopped him?

521
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,988
And in fifth grade
he wanted to kick your ass.

522
00:27:24,108 --> 00:27:25,679
Dom stopped him again.

523
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,506
- To Dom.
- To Dom.

524
00:27:31,194 --> 00:27:33,240
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

525
00:27:41,502 --> 00:27:43,302
- I don't believe this.
- I do.

526
00:27:43,422 --> 00:27:45,621
I'm so stupid.
I never should have trusted him.

527
00:27:45,741 --> 00:27:47,763
No one ever should have.

528
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:56,720
She told me if I ever went to jail again
she would leave me.

529
00:27:59,256 --> 00:28:01,356
I thought if I could just explain

530
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:04,516
she would understand.

531
00:28:08,444 --> 00:28:10,435
You can take me to jail now, E.

532
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,160
- Poor Dom.
- Poor Dom.

533
00:28:16,553 --> 00:28:18,544
I promised to testify
at his parole hearing.

534
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:20,699
- That might help.
- Yeah, in 2020 it might.

535
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:23,257
- You guys did all you could.
- Yeah, we did.

536
00:28:23,377 --> 00:28:25,903
And I'm proud of you, Turtle,
for delivering today.

537
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,078
I just walked nine miles.

538
00:28:30,198 --> 00:28:32,208
- You're a dick.
- Why didn't you call a cab?

539
00:28:32,328 --> 00:28:34,476
Out of principle
and to prove you're a dick.

540
00:28:34,596 --> 00:28:37,927
I thought you said he did a good job.
Yeah, as a worker he was okay.

541
00:28:39,021 --> 00:28:40,821
As a friend he's a animal.

542
00:28:41,912 --> 00:28:43,358
Give me some good news, Ari.

543
00:28:43,478 --> 00:28:45,460
Well, I lost the bet.

544
00:28:45,954 --> 00:28:49,022
Oh great. Maybe you could organize
a poker game with him tomorrow.

545
00:28:50,387 --> 00:28:54,069
No. That's gonna be a little difficult
seeing as how alan is dead.

546
00:28:55,757 --> 00:28:56,613
What?

547
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,323
<i>He's dead, Eric.</i>

548
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:02,702
The joy of me losing
was too much for his angry little heart.

549
00:29:03,131 --> 00:29:05,320
- So what now?
- <i>Well...</i>

550
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:09,207
Now I go home to the family
'cause I realize life is short.

551
00:29:09,327 --> 00:29:11,784
And tomorrow we can see
how alive Vinnie is.

552
00:29:11,904 --> 00:29:13,502
Listen, be well.

553
00:29:17,345 --> 00:29:19,636
Alan's dead.
He had a heart attack.

554
00:29:20,922 --> 00:29:22,751
Jesus, that's awful.

555
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,060
Is it, bro?
