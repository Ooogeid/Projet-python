3
00:01:13,262 --> 00:01:15,831
Hello, E, what a pleasant
pick-me-up start to my morning.

4
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:17,575
Yeah, blow me too, Ari.

5
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,715
Whoo, sugar mouth!

6
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,642
All the blood just rushed
to my power source.

7
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:21,677
What's up?

8
00:01:21,734 --> 00:01:23,383
We don't want to do
the movie with Walsh.

9
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,645
- What do you mean?
- I said,

10
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:26,919
- We want to find another director.
- Another director?

11
00:01:26,998 --> 00:01:30,072
Are you out of your mind?
What, has Walsh been teasing you again?

12
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:31,746
The guy called me a liar and a thief.

13
00:01:32,298 --> 00:01:33,536
Sticks and stones.

14
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:36,295
You can't throw away a movie
just 'cause you can't get along.

15
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:39,176
It's Vince's decision,
not mine, Ari, so let's move on.

16
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:42,104
I don't think you realize
that I pulled off a miracle here.

17
00:01:42,222 --> 00:01:45,060
<i>48 hours ago,
Vince was unemployable.</i>

18
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:47,839
He wants to do the movie,
but not with Walsh. What's the big deal?

19
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:50,400
The big deal is
I sold them on a package...

20
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:52,115
The <i>Medellin</i> package.

21
00:01:52,244 --> 00:01:54,351
We start saying that part
of that package is no good

22
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:57,218
and they start asking questions
that we're not prepared to answer,

23
00:01:57,347 --> 00:01:59,623
like "is <i>Medellin</i> really that good?"

24
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:02,097
<i>do you want to answer that, E?</i>

25
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:04,343
That's what I thought. Now...

26
00:02:04,498 --> 00:02:07,006
You're supposed to be
in Dana Gordon's office this afternoon.

27
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:10,079
<i>I want you to talk to
Vince again before I cancel.</i>

28
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,241
I parted the Red Sea for you, E.

29
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:13,934
Don't piss on the sand.

30
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:17,180
- That Ari?
- Yep. He's not happy.

31
00:02:17,723 --> 00:02:19,494
You are gonna be delighted
when you taste

32
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,933
these fresh,
hand-picked strawberry waffles.

33
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:24,854
- Nice. Where do you pick waffles from?
- Clever, E.

34
00:02:25,164 --> 00:02:27,466
Look at that big fat bad boy
I saved just for you.

35
00:02:27,602 --> 00:02:28,999
Thank you very much, Drama.

36
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:33,191
- Walsh again.
- You gonna answer?

37
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:36,541
Well, let's see. His last email :
"Admit you leaked my trailer and die."

38
00:02:36,645 --> 00:02:39,225
- So no, I don't think so.
- Fuck Ari if he's not happy.

39
00:02:39,762 --> 00:02:41,344
We obviously can't work like this.

40
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:43,190
Which is too bad
because <i>Lost in the Clouds</i>

41
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:45,330
would have been a great
movie with Billy directing.

42
00:02:45,356 --> 00:02:48,149
We'll find another great director,
even if I have to find him myself.

43
00:02:48,204 --> 00:02:51,152
Anyone interested in driving out
to Palmdale to see my cousin Ronnie?

44
00:02:52,082 --> 00:02:53,918
Haven't we been through
this already, Turtle?

45
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:56,808
I'm telling you, guys, he says
he has a little money-making venture.

46
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,704
And in my house,
when cousin Ronnie talks,

47
00:02:58,807 --> 00:03:00,824
like E.F. Hutton,
you better fuckin' listen.

48
00:03:00,944 --> 00:03:02,867
Why do you have so much
confidence in him again?

49
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,712
Are you kidding? You know the guy
always knew how to make a buck.

50
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,936
You don't remember? He was the first
guy on our block to have a foreign car.

51
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:10,622
The first guy to have an in-ground pool.

52
00:03:10,764 --> 00:03:12,390
The first guy to have aluminum siding.

53
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,083
Yeah, and the first guy to have
it all seized by the government.

54
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,790
That's 'cause he didn't pay his taxes

55
00:03:16,842 --> 00:03:18,575
not 'cause
he wasn't rollin' in the green.

56
00:03:18,678 --> 00:03:20,140
What's the investment opportunity?

57
00:03:20,218 --> 00:03:22,312
Now he wouldn't say
on the phone, which means...

58
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,302
He's on the inside, as usual.

59
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,349
- Now, who's in?
- Not me.

60
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:28,668
I'll drive out
to the desert with you, Turtle,

61
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:30,556
maybe hit the outlets along the way.

62
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:32,897
But don't count on me
parting with any cash.

63
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,724
Like I ever do.

64
00:03:45,786 --> 00:03:48,398
- Is there a fax waiting for me?
- I don't think so.

65
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:51,229
Just got off the phone with Dana.
She said she sent over Vinny's offer

66
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,745
- an hour ago.
- I haven't seen it.

67
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:55,461
Well, get up, open your eyes wide
and go find it.

68
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:56,806
Zoom zoom.

69
00:04:02,671 --> 00:04:03,861
Hey, dumbfuck!

70
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:07,536
Please don't be mean to me today.

71
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,614
Is this not an offer
with Vinny's name on it?

72
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:11,964
Yes, it is. I apologize.

73
00:04:12,145 --> 00:04:13,309
What's wrong with you?

74
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:15,847
Speak!

75
00:04:15,995 --> 00:04:17,960
- Tom broke up with me.
- Oh, Jesus.

76
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:19,348
And I don't know what to do.

77
00:04:19,387 --> 00:04:20,786
Well, I tell you what you don't do:

78
00:04:20,837 --> 00:04:23,423
you don't bring it into work
and you don't bring it to me, okay?

79
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:25,922
Because you know that me thinking
about you and tom doing...

80
00:04:26,026 --> 00:04:27,103
You know, makes me sick.

81
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:31,069
So let's focus on work and not on Tom
and everything's going to be okay. Okay?

82
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,286
Get E on the horn

83
00:04:33,446 --> 00:04:35,695
so I can tell him
Vinny is the six million dollar man.

84
00:04:35,811 --> 00:04:37,953
That should knock some sense into him.
Maybe.

85
00:04:38,888 --> 00:04:40,440
How long should I just sit in here?

86
00:04:40,543 --> 00:04:42,664
Oh, I forgot to tell you...
your 10:00 a.m. Is here.

87
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,526
Your forgot to tell me
I had a 10:00 a.m.

88
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:49,985
How are you, mr. Walsh?

89
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:53,481
I'll tell you after you tell me
what kind of deal I'm gonna get

90
00:04:53,686 --> 00:04:55,134
if I let you be my agent.

91
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,981
When I spoke to you yesterday,

92
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:00,542
you didn't tell me that there
was a problem between you and E.

93
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:03,378
Now, unless you handle that,
there's not gonna be any deal

94
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,203
and I'm not gonna
be able to represent you.

95
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,971
I've been trying
to handle it all morning,

96
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:09,570
but I can't get the pale prick
on the phone. Maybe you can.

97
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:13,164
I'm sure I can.
That's what I do. I connect people.

98
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:19,709
Give me one second.

99
00:05:21,564 --> 00:05:23,193
Lloyd! Snap out of it.

100
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,357
Did you call E?

101
00:05:24,978 --> 00:05:26,059
Call now. Forget the offer.

102
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:28,438
Ask him if he and Vince will
please come here immediately.

103
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,274
And tell him
that I used the word "please".

104
00:05:31,024 --> 00:05:32,136
- But Ari?
- Yes?

105
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:33,571
Do you mind dialing?

106
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:36,623
In my traumatized state this morning,
I forgot to put in my contacts.

107
00:05:37,777 --> 00:05:38,915
Billy, I'll be right there.

108
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:41,588
Why do you have to be so skeptical
about everything?

109
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:43,478
Only because I care about you,

110
00:05:43,581 --> 00:05:45,702
and I don't want to see
your little hopes get dashed.

111
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:47,746
You're just jealous
'cause you never cashed in

112
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:49,919
on any of cousin Ronnie's
windfalls in the past.

113
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:51,833
My talent is my windfall.

114
00:05:51,906 --> 00:05:55,846
And you, sadly, and I mean no disrespect
by this, don't have a talent.

115
00:05:55,975 --> 00:05:57,966
So, for you to take
all your cash and to flush...

116
00:05:58,044 --> 00:05:59,816
My talent is knowing my limitations,

117
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:01,937
which is why
I'm only putting half my money in.

118
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,437
So don't sweat it.

119
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,413
This is the place.

120
00:06:05,787 --> 00:06:07,468
- This is where he's staying?
- Yep.

121
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,560
Oh, yeah. He's rolling in it.

122
00:06:10,721 --> 00:06:11,989
Get out of the car, you punk!

123
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:16,347
- You scared the hell out of me...
- What's up?

124
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:18,020
What, now that you're a big celeb,

125
00:06:18,072 --> 00:06:20,270
I'm sure this shit happens
to you all the time, right?

126
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:21,925
Congrats on the show.

127
00:06:22,106 --> 00:06:24,014
- You been watching?
- I have. It's terrible.

128
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:25,989
Eh, but I heard
the networks pay big bucks,

129
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,464
so who gives a fuck, right?

130
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:29,846
- Turtle, come here. Give me a hug!
- How are you?

131
00:06:29,898 --> 00:06:31,139
- Good.
- What's going on?

132
00:06:31,217 --> 00:06:32,742
Ah, you know, just wheelin' and deal'.

133
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,242
So, what do you got for us?

134
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,997
Let's go upstairs.
I don't want to talk out here.

135
00:06:37,706 --> 00:06:39,206
Good to see you guys, man!

136
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,551
- Great to see you.
- This your car, Ronnie?

137
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,425
Dick.

138
00:06:43,606 --> 00:06:46,063
I'm just saying,
don't let Ari get to you.

139
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:48,406
- Why would he get to me?
- iI he yells at you, I mean.

140
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,208
All of the sudden I'm Mr. Sensitive?

141
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:52,910
You have been getting
in a lot of fights lately.

142
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:54,326
I won't let him get to me.

143
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,161
- You promise?
- I promise.

144
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,905
Motherfucker!

145
00:06:59,131 --> 00:07:00,916
- What the fuck is this?
- I have no idea.

146
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,605
Just take it easy.
He comes bringing peace.

147
00:07:03,644 --> 00:07:05,454
- I'm waving the white flag, suit.
- Why?

148
00:07:05,554 --> 00:07:07,158
Because I was wrong and I'm sorry.

149
00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:09,047
You're admitting
I didn't leak the trailer?

150
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:11,512
- I am.
- That's why he came here this morning.

151
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,482
- He said you wouldn't call him back.
- He sent an E-mail at 4:00 a.m.

152
00:07:14,558 --> 00:07:17,354
- threatening to kill me.
- Then at 5:00 a.M., my editor

153
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:20,008
called and told me that he got pissed
at his girl last week

154
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:23,370
and put a video of him giving
her a facial on cumfiesta.com.

155
00:07:23,604 --> 00:07:25,802
She got back at him
with my trailer, our trailer.

156
00:07:26,908 --> 00:07:29,514
- You're a real asshole, you know that?
- I'm man enough to admit

157
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,005
- when I've been acting like one.
- Admit the other thing.

158
00:07:32,943 --> 00:07:34,339
I love <i>Lost in the clouds</i>, Vin.

159
00:07:34,391 --> 00:07:37,365
I read that book four times. I could
shoot the shit out of that thing.

160
00:07:37,886 --> 00:07:40,472
- We don't doubt that.
- Okay now, so...

161
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,170
Are we gonna make this movie?

162
00:07:42,248 --> 00:07:44,663
Are we gonna go talk to Dana Gordon?
What do you say, boys?

163
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:49,167
Come on, E!
As much as we fight,

164
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,119
you know I think
of you and Vinny as family.

165
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,291
Want to climb this mountain together?
We'll kill it.

166
00:07:56,172 --> 00:07:57,206
Sure.

167
00:07:57,382 --> 00:07:58,934
Come here, you motherfucker.

168
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,613
Would you look at that?
Love is in the air!

169
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,593
Is this beautiful or what, Lloyd?

170
00:08:03,804 --> 00:08:05,537
Come and join us in a group hug!

171
00:08:05,907 --> 00:08:07,588
Could be a while before you get some.

172
00:08:09,265 --> 00:08:11,339
Aw, come on!
I was just teasing, Lloyd!

173
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:13,525
It was a joke!
I'll be right back.

174
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:20,202
They don't fuck each other, do they?

175
00:08:20,328 --> 00:08:22,526
Come on, I was just trying
to cheer you up!

176
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:25,318
There is no cheering me up.
My life is over.

177
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:27,646
- It's not over!
- Yes, it is.

178
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:29,604
Without Tom, my life is empty.

179
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,341
An empty vase!

180
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:34,980
- Why a vase?
- Because Tom was a flower.

181
00:08:35,487 --> 00:08:37,661
He was, Ari!
He was a rose,

182
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,509
a bright red rose
in the massive oil spill of life.

183
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,397
And without him, everything is just...

184
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:44,915
Gooky!

185
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:46,701
- Don't laugh at me!
- I'm not laughing,

186
00:08:46,805 --> 00:08:49,287
- but "gooky" is funny.
- I need to take a leave of absence.

187
00:08:49,443 --> 00:08:51,090
- No, you don't.
- I do! I am...

188
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,755
You're a rising star in this company.

189
00:08:53,896 --> 00:08:56,043
- No time for maternity leave.
- Sorry, Ari.

190
00:08:56,146 --> 00:08:58,112
Lloyd, you're gonna
set yourself back years!

191
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:00,005
What will I do?!

192
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:04,792
50 grand, huh?

193
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:08,104
And I'm letting you in on this
because you're my blood and I love you.

194
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,889
and I can only raise 30 grand on my own

195
00:09:10,052 --> 00:09:12,610
'cause the IRS, those cocksuckers,
froze my assets again.

196
00:09:12,687 --> 00:09:15,196
- And so you need 20 grand, then?
- What are you, rain man?

197
00:09:15,325 --> 00:09:16,696
That's what I just told you.

198
00:09:17,192 --> 00:09:18,356
So'd you bring it, or what?

199
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,399
I got it.
It's a check. It's good.

200
00:09:20,554 --> 00:09:21,666
There you go!

201
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:23,807
Last of my Saigon money.

202
00:09:23,844 --> 00:09:25,629
Just what is this investment already?

203
00:09:25,706 --> 00:09:29,083
- Baseball memorabilia.
- Baseball memorabilia?

204
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,945
Not just any baseball memorabilia.

205
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:35,640
I'm talking about a Sandy Koufax
game-used home jersey from '66.

206
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:37,432
50 grand for a jersey?!

207
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,199
That ain't shit, Drama. It's gonna
be worth twice as much as that.

208
00:09:40,284 --> 00:09:41,784
- At least.
- How do you know?

209
00:09:41,894 --> 00:09:44,549
My father, the prick,
is obsessed with Sandy.

210
00:09:45,203 --> 00:09:46,410
He bought a condo in st. Paul

211
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,530
'cause Sandy was living
in the same development.

212
00:09:48,685 --> 00:09:50,417
- So?
- So, my father,

213
00:09:50,473 --> 00:09:51,948
the demented fuck that he is,

214
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,181
makes his tee time
the same as Sandy's every wednesday.

215
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,191
- So what, Ronnie?
- So Sandy hasn't teed off in weeks.

216
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,232
Wait, I don't follow, why not?

217
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:03,471
Jesus christ, you guys
are fuckin' slow, huh?

218
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,451
Sandy's finished. He's done.

219
00:10:05,674 --> 00:10:07,038
His place is a hospice.

220
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:09,798
White coats coming and going
for the last two weeks.

221
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,436
Just a matter of time.

222
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,117
Sandy Koufax is gonna die?

223
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,423
Jesus christ, that's terrible.

224
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:19,449
Yeah, indeed, it is.
My father, he's been a wreck for weeks.

225
00:10:20,175 --> 00:10:21,882
But hey, we gotta make a buck, right?

226
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:25,402
Could you imagine
being able to buy a Picasso

227
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,817
a week before his demise?
We can!

228
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,615
So you can pack the camera in the snow,

229
00:10:33,797 --> 00:10:37,187
have it pointing straight down
the face of the cliff and then...

230
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:39,100
Vinny's beautiful mug pops out,

231
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,709
just those big blue eyes

232
00:10:42,084 --> 00:10:45,780
with the bright, white snow
surrounding them. It'll be magical.

233
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,759
- Sounds like it.
- What do you think, E?

234
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:49,207
Sounds great.

235
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,500
Hi... Guys.
I'm really sorry,

236
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,525
but I called Ari's office
earlier this morning

237
00:10:55,582 --> 00:10:57,807
and asked if the meeting
could be pushed back an hour.

238
00:10:57,884 --> 00:10:59,807
I'm sorry no one told you.
I hope that's okay.

239
00:10:59,885 --> 00:11:01,514
Actually, little lady, it ain't.

240
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,068
So would you please call Dana

241
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:05,844
and tell her
that I gotta be at the track at 4:15

242
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,844
so she better hustle on
down here or I will be gone!

243
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,597
Is this how they run shit
down at Ari's shop?

244
00:11:11,688 --> 00:11:13,110
Relax, I'm calling.

245
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:17,731
Okay, I'm sorry.
How do you spell that? is that, uh,

246
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:19,955
m- u-r-f...

247
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,507
No no no, "p."

248
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,698
...F-p-h-E-y.

249
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:25,715
And you work with Vincent Chase?

250
00:11:25,997 --> 00:11:27,704
Look, just have him call E, okay?

251
00:11:28,294 --> 00:11:30,105
Who the fuck are you
and what are you doing?

252
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,630
Hi, I'm...

253
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,226
Ari, what's going on?

254
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,928
Sorry, I'm having an assistant meltdown.

255
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,603
Why aren't you in the meeting with Dana?

256
00:11:36,681 --> 00:11:38,646
Dana pushed the meeting,
but no one told us.

257
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,942
Tell Eric the meeting was pushed back
an hour. I just saw this!

258
00:11:42,123 --> 00:11:44,236
Listen, is there any way
you can wait it out, buddy?

259
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,032
- Yeah, we're fine.
- I'm not fine!

260
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:49,232
- Although Walsh is really pissed.
- Let me talk to him.

261
00:11:49,336 --> 00:11:50,525
Ari wants to talk to you.

262
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:53,396
Fuck Ari! Tell him I haven't
signed those agency papers yet.

263
00:11:54,183 --> 00:11:55,192
I heard him.

264
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,983
- I'll talk to you later.
- Later. Listen.

265
00:11:57,034 --> 00:11:58,198
Let me know how it goes.

266
00:11:59,314 --> 00:12:01,719
I need a fucking assistant!

267
00:12:02,706 --> 00:12:04,878
As I was saying, Mr. Gold, I'm Glen...

268
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:07,560
Glen Holden. I'm gonna
come off Eric Siegel's desk...

269
00:12:07,612 --> 00:12:08,775
How do I know you?

270
00:12:08,827 --> 00:12:10,689
You fired me
from the mailroom two years ago,

271
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:12,931
but you realized you were wrong,
so you hired me back.

272
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,433
No, I can get the job done.
Just tell me what you like.

273
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:16,820
No, I don't tell you what I like.

274
00:12:16,872 --> 00:12:19,044
My old assistant is supposed
to tell you what I like.

275
00:12:19,096 --> 00:12:21,139
And then he is supposed
to seamlessly train you

276
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:22,914
so that the only change in my life

277
00:12:23,095 --> 00:12:25,397
comes when I have to write out
a christmas bonus check.

278
00:12:25,474 --> 00:12:26,845
Okay, Mr. Gold, please look it.

279
00:12:26,923 --> 00:12:28,526
- I'm just gonna...
- Get out of here.

280
00:12:28,604 --> 00:12:31,300
- Where do you want me to go?
- Anywhere but here or I'll kill you.

281
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:32,903
Do you want me to get you someone else?

282
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,105
No, I only want Lloyd
and I will get him myself!

283
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:39,707
Stop looking at me like that.

284
00:12:40,048 --> 00:12:42,117
We were never guys
who were about money.

285
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:44,376
We were always guys
who were about integrity.

286
00:12:44,686 --> 00:12:46,419
Is that what got you
to do that commercial

287
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,034
where you and your wife
had a bad case of the runs at the opera?

288
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,530
That was a national spot.

289
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,682
And I got a chance
to show a lot of range.

290
00:12:53,256 --> 00:12:55,594
All right, look,
I don't feel great about this either.

291
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,037
But if we don't buy it,
somebody else will.

292
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,011
Besides, I can't let Ronnie down.

293
00:13:01,088 --> 00:13:04,114
You know how many times he gave
my mother money when my father wouldn't?

294
00:13:04,347 --> 00:13:05,987
If I don't do it, he won't be able to.

295
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:08,599
So, if you still want in for half,
you got it.

296
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:12,446
It's blood money.
So, never. Never never.

297
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:14,602
Let's go make a bundle, huh?

298
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:17,452
Come on, let's go, let's go.

299
00:13:17,633 --> 00:13:20,098
- Why does this guy look so morbid?
- He always looks morbid.

300
00:13:20,562 --> 00:13:22,023
... Game-worn jersey!

301
00:13:22,191 --> 00:13:25,497
Bidding starts at $1,000.
Do I hear $1,500?

302
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,575
$1,500! Do I hear $2,000?
$2,000 in the back!

303
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:31,930
I am so sorry about the mix-up.

304
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:33,935
Hey, we got nothing better to do, right?

305
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,748
How are you guys?

306
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:39,496
It's great to see you.
Why don't you come on in my office?

307
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,643
So, we are hoping to go
into production in 12 weeks.

308
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:50,895
And we've got a preliminary
budget estimate of $55 million.

309
00:13:50,999 --> 00:13:54,379
55, well that is obviously ridiculous.

310
00:13:54,818 --> 00:13:56,810
Is it?
There's not even a script yet.

311
00:13:56,887 --> 00:13:58,847
Well, I'd be writing the script, right?

312
00:13:58,898 --> 00:14:00,605
And I know this book inside out.

313
00:14:00,683 --> 00:14:02,933
And as big as it is,
I want to visualize it bigger.

314
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,877
I want the blizzard
to make the... The desert

315
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,774
in "lawrence of arabia"
look like a fucking sandbox.

316
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:10,970
And I won't speak for
anybody else in this room,

317
00:14:11,074 --> 00:14:13,608
but for me, after what I just
pulled off on <i>Medellin</i>

318
00:14:13,712 --> 00:14:15,940
with no budget,
I'd rather wait

319
00:14:16,587 --> 00:14:19,949
to collect my gold statue
and have dollars start flying at me

320
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:22,462
than get involved
in an underfinanced project again.

321
00:14:22,617 --> 00:14:24,906
So you think you're gonna win
an oscar for <i>Medellin</i>?

322
00:14:24,984 --> 00:14:26,794
I'd bet my left pinkie that me and Vince

323
00:14:26,872 --> 00:14:29,484
are both gonna get one,
and E might even be lucky enough

324
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:31,832
to ride our coattails
right onto that stage.

325
00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:34,225
You mind if I use your private shitter?

326
00:14:34,277 --> 00:14:37,173
I just gotta piss, but the one in
the hallway stank like a refugee boat.

327
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,755
Sure, go ahead.

328
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:40,745
He's quite a character.

329
00:14:41,168 --> 00:14:42,435
He's all bluster.

330
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,432
But he knows exactly what he's doing.

331
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:46,327
Well, it's kinda weird.

332
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:48,419
I mean, he's foul and grotesque,

333
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:50,287
conceited and abhorrent.

334
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:52,717
But I kinda like him.

335
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:23,871
Livin' large, Lloyd.
Looks like I'm paying you too much.

336
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,894
I have family money. And it
hasn't affected my work ethic at all,

337
00:15:27,972 --> 00:15:30,661
- so don't make fun of me.
- I'm not making fun of you.

338
00:15:30,713 --> 00:15:32,467
I'm here because I need you back.

339
00:15:33,908 --> 00:15:37,602
Listen, the best way
to get over a breakup

340
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,075
is a distraction,
and the best distraction is work.

341
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,247
Work is the reason we broke up.

342
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:46,018
Tom hated that I was never home,
he hated my hours.

343
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,955
<i>Work ripped us apart.</i>

344
00:15:48,203 --> 00:15:50,557
<i>Work ruined everything, Ari!</i>

345
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:54,819
I will come back to you
when Tom comes back to me!

346
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:56,131
Okay? Goodbye!

347
00:16:06,892 --> 00:16:08,237
I just wanna do the paddle.

348
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,409
Oh ho, no. you're not in.

349
00:16:10,615 --> 00:16:12,166
So I'm raising the paddle.

350
00:16:12,954 --> 00:16:14,557
You're a real dick, you know that?

351
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:17,395
And now, for our featured
auction item of the day:

352
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:22,091
lot 235...
a 1966 Sandy Koufax

353
00:16:22,392 --> 00:16:23,841
home flannel jersey.

354
00:16:27,642 --> 00:16:29,763
- Where the hell's Ronnie?
- Here he is, move over.

355
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,620
Shows nice game use,

356
00:16:31,723 --> 00:16:33,068
no alterations of any kind.

357
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:35,137
It's from Sandy's third cy young season.

358
00:16:35,266 --> 00:16:37,626
- Where the hell you been?
- On the phone with my father.

359
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:39,769
My brother ratted me out,
told him what I was doing.

360
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:41,941
- How'd he take it?
- He's heartbroken, the prick.

361
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,245
Yeah, I'm with him.

362
00:16:43,297 --> 00:16:45,780
You could still get out,
Ronnie, save your soul.

363
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,669
As many of you know, Sandy was supposed
to be here to sign some autographs,

364
00:16:49,747 --> 00:16:51,557
but sadly,
he was unable to make the trip.

365
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:55,410
Anyway,
let the bidding begin at $20,000.

366
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,272
- I have $20,000...
- Fuck it, I'm in,.

367
00:16:57,464 --> 00:16:58,679
- Do I have 21?
- Really?

368
00:16:58,757 --> 00:17:01,239
- Since the news is official.
- Do I hear 22?

369
00:17:01,343 --> 00:17:03,619
22.
Do I have 24?

370
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,302
24. Do I have 25?
25?

371
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:08,046
25!

372
00:17:08,668 --> 00:17:11,434
Do we have 28? 28!
Do we have 31?

373
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:13,329
31!

374
00:17:13,381 --> 00:17:14,984
31. Do I hear 35?

375
00:17:15,062 --> 00:17:17,933
Give me $35,000!
$35,000!

376
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:20,597
Give me 40!
Give me $40,000!

377
00:17:20,695 --> 00:17:21,962
- Do we have 40?
- 40.

378
00:17:22,066 --> 00:17:24,911
- 40! Do we have $42,000?
- I'm sorry, I can't do this.

379
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:26,187
Why why why?

380
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,779
I can't do this to my father.
I can't do this to Sandy.

381
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:30,608
- I got $43,000!
- I'm sorry!

382
00:17:33,865 --> 00:17:35,443
What the fuck
we supposed to do now?

383
00:17:35,831 --> 00:17:37,693
Don't worry about it.
I'll cover his share.

384
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,103
- 45!
- $45,000 right there! Do I have 48?

385
00:17:41,164 --> 00:17:44,029
Billy, are you sure you can have
a shootable script done in six weeks?

386
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,198
No doubt.
I came up with the first act

387
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,085
while I was stinking up
the skirt's bathroom.

388
00:17:48,137 --> 00:17:49,585
Just promise me you won't take a job

389
00:17:49,663 --> 00:17:51,137
- that could interfere.
- I promise.

390
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:52,521
Beautiful.

391
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:56,194
- Billy, nice car!
- Yeah, it's my girl's father's.

392
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,110
You're not the only one
mooching luxury items

393
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,062
off somebody, suit! Later!

394
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:02,647
Late!

395
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:05,125
What's up?

396
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,001
You haven't said a word
in like half an hour.

397
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:09,199
How could I say a word?
He doesn't shut the fuck up.

398
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,930
- You know he likes to talk.
- I can't do this, Vince.

399
00:18:12,034 --> 00:18:13,818
- Do what?
- This movie, not with him.

400
00:18:13,936 --> 00:18:15,824
You got the apology.
What more do you want?

401
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,815
I want to get along
with the people I work with.

402
00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:20,308
Life's too short to spend
another year being fucking abused

403
00:18:20,385 --> 00:18:22,739
- and you should respect that.
- I respect it, I do.

404
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:25,058
But what now?

405
00:18:31,881 --> 00:18:32,889
Excuse me, hey.

406
00:18:32,966 --> 00:18:34,544
I'm wondering
if you know where Tom is?

407
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:35,941
I am tom.

408
00:18:36,123 --> 00:18:37,572
- You're Tom?
- Yes.

409
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:41,284
- Lloyd's Tom?
- I used to be.

410
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:43,081
- Who are you?
- I don't get it.

411
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:45,099
You're a good looking guy.
You can get girls.

412
00:18:45,449 --> 00:18:47,337
- How'd you know?
- Well, it's just a sketch,

413
00:18:47,415 --> 00:18:49,846
but Lloyd uses
your face as a dartboard.

414
00:18:50,234 --> 00:18:52,044
- Really?
- He's a really good artist.

415
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,938
Can I talk to you for a second?

416
00:18:55,131 --> 00:18:56,242
Yeah, over here.

417
00:18:56,373 --> 00:18:58,286
Look, I'm already
on finish line probation,

418
00:18:58,364 --> 00:18:59,864
so I gotta make myself look busy.

419
00:18:59,942 --> 00:19:01,597
What are you, seven and a half, eight?

420
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:02,919
- 11, tom?
- Really?

421
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:08,747
- So, did he send you down here?
- No, I came down here on my own.

422
00:19:08,824 --> 00:19:11,618
I heard a lot about your problems
with Lloyd... That he's never home,

423
00:19:11,747 --> 00:19:13,339
that he's too career-oriented.

424
00:19:13,468 --> 00:19:15,675
- You gonna tell me he's not?
- No no. He is, he is.

425
00:19:15,753 --> 00:19:17,511
But let me ask you
something though, man:

426
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:20,814
do you want a guy who's gonna
provide a great home for you,

427
00:19:20,891 --> 00:19:23,891
or some cooz who's on the couch
every day watching Oprah at 4:00?

428
00:19:23,969 --> 00:19:25,467
Oprah's on at 3:00, Ari.

429
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,502
And, look... Yeah, I do hate
Lloyd's hours. Take a seat.

430
00:19:29,786 --> 00:19:31,678
But, you know, I'm a guy.

431
00:19:31,807 --> 00:19:33,307
I understand career goals.

432
00:19:34,937 --> 00:19:36,105
So, what's the problem?

433
00:19:36,182 --> 00:19:38,665
The problem is he couldn't
keep his dick in his pants.

434
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,795
- He cheated on me.
- No... Lloyd cheated on you?

435
00:19:42,873 --> 00:19:44,864
No, he didn't, he would never...
Are you serious?

436
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,493
Yeah, it's true.
I caught him.

437
00:19:46,855 --> 00:19:48,297
In the act?
Like, he was...

438
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,004
No, I didn't catch him in the act,

439
00:19:50,082 --> 00:19:52,383
but, you know, I was
suspicious Friday night.

440
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:54,021
He said he was going down to the Abbey.

441
00:19:54,124 --> 00:19:56,090
I parked my car out front.
He never showed.

442
00:19:56,551 --> 00:19:58,362
Never. I confronted him and, you know,

443
00:19:58,439 --> 00:20:01,015
he said that he didn't want
to be interrogated like that.

444
00:20:01,481 --> 00:20:03,550
Lloyd... Lloyd was with me Friday night.

445
00:20:04,105 --> 00:20:05,579
- He was with you?
- Yes.

446
00:20:05,683 --> 00:20:07,822
At "the Bourne Ultimatum" premiere.

447
00:20:07,977 --> 00:20:10,046
- Until like 2:00 a.m.!
- That is bullshit!

448
00:20:10,123 --> 00:20:11,416
No no no!
You know what?

449
00:20:11,468 --> 00:20:14,504
I think I even have
a picture of it in my phone.

450
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,612
- Why wouldn't he tell me that?
- He told me

451
00:20:16,742 --> 00:20:19,328
that if he told you that he was
working on another friday night,

452
00:20:19,457 --> 00:20:21,874
that you would tell him
that it was over.

453
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:23,788
You tell him that?

454
00:20:23,994 --> 00:20:26,666
Oh my gosh!
I mean... Maybe I did...

455
00:20:26,795 --> 00:20:28,295
You did.
You did.

456
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:31,250
Lloyd is the best guy I know.
He would never cheat on you.

457
00:20:32,596 --> 00:20:34,173
Oh, man. I feel awful.

458
00:20:34,973 --> 00:20:36,861
- You cheated on Tom?!
- What?

459
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:38,878
<i>You little fuckin' slut, Lloyd!</i>

460
00:20:38,956 --> 00:20:40,546
I don't know what you're talking about.

461
00:20:40,623 --> 00:20:41,910
I just saw Tom.

462
00:20:43,002 --> 00:20:44,786
- He came to the office?
- I went to his.

463
00:20:44,864 --> 00:20:46,493
He told me what you did.

464
00:20:48,756 --> 00:20:51,637
I couldn't help it, Ari!
It's been all the pressure.

465
00:20:51,948 --> 00:20:54,172
And I met this cute barista
at the coffee bean

466
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,037
who I never thought would like me.
But he did like me, he did.

467
00:20:57,185 --> 00:20:59,745
<i>It was a one-time thing.
I go to Starbucks now.</i>

468
00:20:59,886 --> 00:21:01,696
<i>But I ruined everything.</i>

469
00:21:01,967 --> 00:21:04,476
No, you didn't ruin everything,
'cause I saved it.

470
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,147
Saved it?
What do you mean?

471
00:21:06,276 --> 00:21:09,140
You were with me Friday night
at <i>The Bourne Ultimatum</i> premiere.

472
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,263
I was?

473
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:12,661
Get your ass back to the office
within the hour

474
00:21:12,713 --> 00:21:14,213
and I will stick to that story.

475
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,480
Let me tell you something:

476
00:21:15,584 --> 00:21:17,621
I love a liar, but I hate a cheater.

477
00:21:17,931 --> 00:21:19,001
- <i>See ya!</i>
- Wait!

478
00:21:19,551 --> 00:21:21,000
I can't believe you did this for me.

479
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:22,486
I like you. What can I say?

480
00:21:22,563 --> 00:21:24,554
Say you'll let me take
you and the wife to dinner

481
00:21:24,606 --> 00:21:27,004
- with tom, a couples dinner.
- I don't like you that much.

482
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:28,555
Get your ass back to the office

483
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:31,121
and get that fuckin' dartboard
down off your wall!

484
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,687
$62,000. This was supposed
to go for no more than 50.

485
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,101
What's the difference? It'll cut
into our profit margin a bit is all.

486
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:44,068
Ah, the Koufax bidders.

487
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,077
- That's us.
- You guys big fans?

488
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,150
- Oh, die-hards.
- We're New Yorkers.

489
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:50,478
Sandy would've been really
pleased to meet you guys.

490
00:21:50,581 --> 00:21:52,133
Such a shame he
couldn't get out here.

491
00:21:52,262 --> 00:21:53,839
Yeah, it would've been a great thrill.

492
00:21:53,942 --> 00:21:56,348
Sad, really.
Hasn't left his house in a month.

493
00:21:56,972 --> 00:21:58,524
Oh, no. Is everything okay?

494
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:00,925
We'd be devastated
if something happened to Sandy.

495
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,235
Sandy's as well as can be expected.

496
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,071
His dog's been sick for months.

497
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,782
He did everything he could,
but he finally succumbed.

498
00:22:07,955 --> 00:22:09,093
His dog?

499
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:11,457
His beloved giant schnauzer, pee wee.

500
00:22:11,949 --> 00:22:14,018
Made it to 19.
That's pretty good for a dog.

501
00:22:14,643 --> 00:22:16,198
But you know what?
Next month,

502
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,863
Sandy's gonna be out here
for the celebrity pro-am.

503
00:22:18,991 --> 00:22:21,060
He's favored as usual...
healthy as a clam.

504
00:22:21,436 --> 00:22:23,039
Maybe you guys can catch him then.

505
00:22:23,976 --> 00:22:25,133
Maybe.

506
00:22:28,088 --> 00:22:29,847
I'm gonna kill your cousin.

507
00:22:31,537 --> 00:22:32,701
Kill him.

508
00:22:36,156 --> 00:22:38,132
Tom, you know
I saw and loved <i>Dreamgirls</i>

509
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:41,365
when it was in the theater, but I will
gladly watch it again with you tonight.

510
00:22:42,313 --> 00:22:43,658
I saw it with my mother.

511
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:47,728
- Just tell us what our options are.
- Well, let's see.

512
00:22:47,805 --> 00:22:49,547
We can all drink poison gatorade

513
00:22:49,624 --> 00:22:51,771
and hope that the next life
is better than this one.

514
00:22:51,874 --> 00:22:53,348
Come on, E. You drink first.

515
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,872
Vince, you really want
to throw away a go movie?

516
00:22:58,192 --> 00:23:00,390
E, it's your job to help him

517
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:03,094
to get the movies that he wants,
not to fuck them up!

518
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:05,499
You know he's helped me get
everything I've ever wanted.

519
00:23:05,577 --> 00:23:08,798
Come on, all right. So, you don't
like it when people talk down to you.

520
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:10,427
People talk down to me every day.

521
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:12,697
If I let go of all my clients
that talk down to me,

522
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,352
he'd be the only one I had left.

523
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,673
I mean, Jesus, man,
after all he's done for you,

524
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,767
swallow your pride
and take one for the team.

525
00:23:21,357 --> 00:23:24,269
- Tell him that you wanna do this movie.
- He knows I wanna do the movie.

526
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:25,642
And he knows that I don't.

527
00:23:25,797 --> 00:23:27,329
Look, I shouldn't be producing anyway.

528
00:23:27,432 --> 00:23:29,318
You wanna do this movie?
I'll sit this one out.

529
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:30,547
Here comes the Irish guilt.

530
00:23:30,624 --> 00:23:32,070
There's no guilt.
The truth is,

531
00:23:32,173 --> 00:23:33,971
I don't like standing
around on sets anyway.

532
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,337
That's not why I came out here.

533
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,768
I'll go back to managing
and find the next project.

534
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,423
Boom! Problem solved.

535
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:41,152
He goes back to being a manager,

536
00:23:41,354 --> 00:23:43,338
I get him paid as a producer anyway.

537
00:23:43,934 --> 00:23:45,667
Lottery strikes again for you, E.

538
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:46,942
Are you sure about this?

539
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,973
And as your manager,
I'm sure of something else.

540
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:51,267
- Oh, yeah? What?
- You shouldn't be doing this movie,

541
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:52,864
- not with Billy.
- Jesus, fuck.

542
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,442
And it's not my pride.
It's because I think Walsh has peaked.

543
00:23:55,494 --> 00:23:57,356
And I think
his best days are behind him.

544
00:23:57,973 --> 00:23:59,371
And I think he fucked up <i>Medellin</i>.

545
00:23:59,422 --> 00:24:01,429
- You know I don't agree with you.
- Nor do I.

546
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:03,834
- You haven't seen it.
- I'm against you either way.

547
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:07,457
- It's your choice, Vince.
- It is your choice.

548
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,922
It's your life. He's just a passenger
lucky to have a seat.

549
00:24:12,794 --> 00:24:14,010
I'm gonna do the movie.

550
00:24:14,698 --> 00:24:18,189
There you go!
I'll have a $2 million advance check

551
00:24:18,396 --> 00:24:20,931
cut for you today!
How horrible!

552
00:24:22,005 --> 00:24:24,792
Bring in some bubbly!
We're doing a little celebrating.

553
00:24:26,163 --> 00:24:28,710
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah. I just wanted to be heard.

554
00:24:29,264 --> 00:24:31,138
- Well, you weew.
- Yeah, I guess I was.
