3
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:17,850
Aspirin, please.

4
00:01:18,115 --> 00:01:19,028
Please.

5
00:01:19,273 --> 00:01:22,120
You know, Vin, I don't think
I've ever seen you hung-over before.

6
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,546
Half a bottle of Johnnie Walker
will take anyone down.

7
00:01:24,706 --> 00:01:27,006
Especially when you mix it
with half a bottle of vodka.

8
00:01:27,126 --> 00:01:28,586
Oh my God, did I?

9
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:31,343
Drama kind of forced it on you,
but yeah you did.

10
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,912
How's he doing?
Any sounds coming from in there?

11
00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:36,815
Last I heard, sounded like
someone torturing kittens.

12
00:01:36,935 --> 00:01:38,325
You know, it was...

13
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:40,645
Come on. Please.

14
00:01:41,238 --> 00:01:43,175
We've got to help him out today,

15
00:01:43,407 --> 00:01:45,171
get him together.
He's doing <i>The View</i>.

16
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:48,293
He can get some solid press
if he yaks all over Whoopi Goldberg.

17
00:01:51,354 --> 00:01:52,289
Come in.

18
00:01:53,588 --> 00:01:56,082
- What's up, bro?
- A little hung-over. You?

19
00:01:56,202 --> 00:01:58,884
Purged myself by sunrise.
I feel great.

20
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:02,459
Thinking about wearing a tank on
the show so I'm getting my arms yoked.

21
00:02:02,635 --> 00:02:04,452
- You all right, Drama?
- Yeah, great.

22
00:02:04,572 --> 00:02:07,343
I'm doing <i>The View</i> at Caesars.
Who wouldn't be great?

23
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:10,540
Can see you're not hung-over. Where's
all the post-break-up depression gone?

24
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,499
Leave him alone.
He looks great. Look at him.

25
00:02:12,619 --> 00:02:14,124
Yeah, maybe he forgot about it.

26
00:02:14,244 --> 00:02:15,865
I haven't forgotten shit.

27
00:02:16,377 --> 00:02:19,851
My heart's been broken into hundreds
and hundreds of tiny little pieces.

28
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:21,979
But I'm doing <i>The View</i> today.

29
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:24,189
So I'm postponing my depression
until after I kill it.

30
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:25,732
Love the attitude.

31
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:28,018
You gonna love it live, bro?
Only a 45-minute flight.

32
00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:30,904
I wish I could, but I've got
generals with all the studio heads.

33
00:02:31,476 --> 00:02:33,057
Oh yeah, that's right.

34
00:02:34,046 --> 00:02:34,914
Here,

35
00:02:35,464 --> 00:02:37,070
maybe you should bulk up.

36
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:45,381
So what do you talk about
in a general meeting anyway?

37
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:46,873
General stuff, I guess.

38
00:02:46,993 --> 00:02:48,289
Yeah, I guess.

39
00:02:48,865 --> 00:02:50,297
Would you look at this.

40
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,258
I didn't know he was coming.
Did you?

41
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:53,904
- Nope.
- Should I hit him?

42
00:02:54,024 --> 00:02:55,970
No, look, he's waving a white flag.

43
00:02:58,643 --> 00:03:00,279
Guess who read the script.

44
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:02,446
Which script?
The one we told you to read last week?

45
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:04,474
That's right. And it's very good.

46
00:03:04,594 --> 00:03:06,353
- We told you that last week.
- Right,

47
00:03:06,473 --> 00:03:08,149
and it is perfect timing for us.

48
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:10,944
- How is it perfect timing?
- We have general meetings all week,

49
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:12,573
and there's nothing greater in life

50
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,786
than having something
specific to say at a general.

51
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:16,623
And what specifically
do we have to say?

52
00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:18,337
That we want to do <i>Smokejumpers</i>.

53
00:03:18,457 --> 00:03:20,662
- But Ed Norton already wants to do it.
- Does he?

54
00:03:20,822 --> 00:03:23,021
Yeah, he does. All because
you didn't read the script.

55
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:25,604
I didn't read the script
because you didn't pitch it well.

56
00:03:25,724 --> 00:03:27,478
You really gonna try
to blame this on me?

57
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:29,075
Yes, I'm gonna fucking blame you.

58
00:03:29,195 --> 00:03:31,138
You said it was an indie.
You said it was small.

59
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:33,676
Small people think small,
so I can't totally blame you for that.

60
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,605
But anyone with half a sense
of the business

61
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:38,914
would have read it and known, okay,
you got a script that's well-written

62
00:03:39,034 --> 00:03:40,918
about the greatest fire
in Oregon history

63
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:42,855
for 90 pages and you never see it.

64
00:03:42,975 --> 00:03:45,577
Live inside that fire for 50 pages,

65
00:03:45,847 --> 00:03:47,051
boom, home run.

66
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:49,522
Now it's Ed Norton's home run,
you jerk-off.

67
00:03:49,642 --> 00:03:51,640
Well, did they sell the script,
you cunt face?

68
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,820
Not yet, dick head.

69
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,697
Then it's still free,
you overpaid undersized bitch.

70
00:03:55,857 --> 00:03:58,290
You want a go?
Seriously, let's just go right here.

71
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,369
You've never been hit in the face with
anything besides a cock and you know it.

72
00:04:02,387 --> 00:04:04,480
I already told Amanda
she has the script exclusively.

73
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,250
Then tell her she doesn't.
Or don't, it's not our concern.

74
00:04:08,346 --> 00:04:10,183
I don't want to put E in a tough spot.

75
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:12,547
A tough spot?
He reps the writers.

76
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:16,003
Two buyers will only
increase the price for his clients.

77
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:17,606
He's right.
He's right.

78
00:04:17,726 --> 00:04:20,111
I did tell you guys
you could have the script first.

79
00:04:21,381 --> 00:04:24,093
- This is Amanda right here.
- Listen, ignore it. Come on, Vinnie.

80
00:04:24,801 --> 00:04:25,725
Morning, E.

81
00:04:25,845 --> 00:04:28,354
Great news.
Ed's company wants to buy the script.

82
00:04:28,611 --> 00:04:30,614
- Ed norton's wants to buy the script.
- How much?

83
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:32,399
- For how much?
- 100 against 300,

84
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,459
which is a great deal
for first-time writers.

85
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:36,529
- 100 against 300.
- We can do better.

86
00:04:37,558 --> 00:04:39,109
- E, you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

87
00:04:39,229 --> 00:04:40,274
What do you think?

88
00:04:40,394 --> 00:04:43,077
I think I should probably talk to my
clients first to see what they think.

89
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,419
- Okay, call me back.
- All right, thanks, Amanda.

90
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:48,629
- Now there's an offer.
- I can top it. Let's go, Vinnie.

91
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,991
- I'm sorry, Vince.
- You have no reason to be.

92
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:54,088
You do what you have to do.
I understand, really.

93
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,699
Thanks, buddy.

94
00:04:58,957 --> 00:05:01,651
You're not wearing a tank top
and fucking shorts on <i>The View</i>.

95
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:04,223
- You think you are Richard Simmons?
- Only gayer.

96
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:06,088
You know, I expect that from him.

97
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,968
You're my publicist
who I now employ. So do your job.

98
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:11,261
What's your problem?
Still broken-hearted?

99
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:13,111
- Oh yeah.
- Shut up, Turtle.

100
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:15,151
I'm sorry, Drama,
but it's affecting all of us.

101
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,405
- You slept with my dog last night.
- I was lonely.

102
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:21,318
You're not gonna embarrass yourself
on <i>The View</i>, are you, Drama?

103
00:05:21,438 --> 00:05:23,128
I'm gonna be fine on the show.

104
00:05:23,248 --> 00:05:25,395
It's when I get home
I may have some issues.

105
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:26,976
Your real life is your problem,

106
00:05:27,096 --> 00:05:29,403
your public perception is mine.
So keep it together.

107
00:05:29,794 --> 00:05:33,301
Please, I'm a professional.
You don't even have to worry about that.

108
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,184
- Hey, Drama!
- What's up, castmates?

109
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:38,188
- What's up?
- What's up, dude?

110
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:41,118
- Did you bring your girl?
- Uh, no.

111
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:43,512
We thought you said
she might be flying in.

112
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:46,021
Yeah, she was gonna,
but no, she didn't.

113
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:48,358
Damn, we were dying
to meet her, man.

114
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:52,490
I don't think you met
my girlfriend Sophia, right?

115
00:05:53,558 --> 00:05:55,629
No. I don't believe so. Hi.

116
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,486
So you all brought
your girlfriends, huh?

117
00:06:07,605 --> 00:06:09,273
You okay, Drama?

118
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:11,965
I'm a rock.

119
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:19,601
$100,000? That is unreal.
You did it, E.

120
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,840
That's just the first offer.
It's not 100, it's 100 against 300.

121
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,513
<i>What does that mean, against?</i>

122
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:26,681
It means if the movie gets
made you get another 200.

123
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:29,266
If it gets made? Why wouldn't
it get made? We got Ed Norton.

124
00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:31,049
It doesn't always work like that.

125
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:33,222
Why would they buy it
if they don't want to make it?

126
00:06:33,342 --> 00:06:35,237
- <i>They do want to make it</i>.
- What's he saying?

127
00:06:35,357 --> 00:06:38,526
I don't know. Ed Norton wants
it but they may not make it.

128
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,555
<i>Vince wants it
but they may not buy it.</i>

129
00:06:40,813 --> 00:06:42,992
- It sounds fishy to me.
- Give me the phone.

130
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:44,203
E, Nick here.

131
00:06:44,323 --> 00:06:45,669
- <i>Hey</i>.
- So what's going on?

132
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:47,544
Trying to sell the script
like you asked.

133
00:06:47,664 --> 00:06:49,287
There's no time to screw around.

134
00:06:49,447 --> 00:06:52,576
Well say it succinctly then and tell me
exactly what's going on.

135
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:55,315
Vince is out trying to sell the studios
and we have a first offer

136
00:06:55,435 --> 00:06:57,903
from Ed Norton's company
that I'd like to try to get more out of.

137
00:06:58,023 --> 00:07:00,017
Yeah, how much more
do you think we can get?

138
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:02,603
- <i>I don't know</i>.
- Isn't it your job to know?

139
00:07:03,314 --> 00:07:05,814
If Ed Norton wants to do it
and Vincent Chase wants to do it,

140
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:07,817
seems like we can play them
against each other

141
00:07:07,937 --> 00:07:09,665
and start a little bidding war here.

142
00:07:09,768 --> 00:07:11,497
Let's not jump ahead of ourselves.

143
00:07:11,617 --> 00:07:14,218
Look, I read about this shit
all the time in <i>Variety</i>.

144
00:07:14,414 --> 00:07:16,230
Just raise the price
and get a guarantee

145
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,733
- <i>that our movie gets made</i>.
- It'll never happen.

146
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:21,569
500 gs and a guarantee
that the movie gets made.

147
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:22,992
It'll never happen.

148
00:07:23,112 --> 00:07:26,239
Well, it seems like everybody in that
town of yours loves our script, right?

149
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:28,287
So guess what?
You make it happen.

150
00:07:29,346 --> 00:07:31,384
So you're thinking of this
as a big movie?

151
00:07:31,504 --> 00:07:32,777
Huge, Steve.

152
00:07:33,222 --> 00:07:36,666
The fire in this is gonna make <i>Backdraft</i>
look like a fucking campfire.

153
00:07:36,786 --> 00:07:39,670
- Excuse my language.
- That's interesting. Interesting.

154
00:07:40,268 --> 00:07:42,340
- Yeah. How interesting?
- Interesting enough to buy?

155
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:45,676
I don't know if it's that interesting.
But you know what does interest me?

156
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:48,554
Benji.

157
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,225
The dog?

158
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:54,018
We're taking him to Alaska.

159
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,797
At least we got the president
of the studio doing business with us.

160
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:01,827
- About Benji?
- It's a cute dog, right?

161
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:04,739
- Maybe it'll be a good script.
- You bet your ass it'll be.

162
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,720
And I'm gonna make sure
they have Miss Alaska

163
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,841
waiting in your trailer
to blow you at all times.

164
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:10,377
- Thanks.
- How'd it go?

165
00:08:10,497 --> 00:08:12,069
Great. How'd it go with your writers?

166
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:14,668
They want 500 gs and a guarantee
that the movie gets made.

167
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:16,885
Sound like a bunch of idiots.
Perfect clients for you.

168
00:08:17,005 --> 00:08:18,709
- Thank you.
- Yeah, Lloyd?

169
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:20,086
Steve Parles calling.

170
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:22,268
Steve Parles.
Put him through.

171
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:26,450
Yeah, Vince was to go
to the Arctic Circle with you and Benji

172
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,944
but he wants 10 million
plus first dollar

173
00:08:29,064 --> 00:08:32,306
- and a five-star igloo.
- I'm calling about "smokejumpers."

174
00:08:33,122 --> 00:08:34,013
Really?

175
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:36,417
I couldn't say this in front
of Vince out of respect for him

176
00:08:36,537 --> 00:08:38,355
but I want to buy that script.

177
00:08:39,045 --> 00:08:39,856
Really?

178
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:41,732
But not with Vince attached.

179
00:08:44,338 --> 00:08:46,542
The script only comes
with Vince attached.

180
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:49,214
I'll pay 350. And how about
I toss Vince an ep credit

181
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:50,783
and 50 gs because I like him?

182
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:52,509
Ep credit?
What the fuck?

183
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:55,371
Listen, he is a movie star,
not a no-show producer.

184
00:08:55,637 --> 00:08:57,874
Come on.
Does Vince even own the script?

185
00:08:58,058 --> 00:08:59,500
Consider it as if he does.

186
00:08:59,704 --> 00:09:01,335
- Yeah, who reps it?
- Who knows?

187
00:09:01,495 --> 00:09:03,423
And who are the writers?
There's no cover page.

188
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,603
Listen, Steve.

189
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,675
Who are the fucking writers, Ari?

190
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:09,307
Could be Gaghan or Zaillian.

191
00:09:09,427 --> 00:09:11,511
Could be bill fucking
Shakespeare. I'll never tell.

192
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:13,106
<i>Stop acting like a child.</i>

193
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:15,850
Vince starred in the highest-grossing
movie of all time.

194
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:19,520
- You know that he can carry this movie.
- I love Vince, Ari. You know that.

195
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,068
I just can't risk it right now.

196
00:09:21,188 --> 00:09:22,956
I can't sell you the script then.

197
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:24,609
- Come on.
- I'm sorry.

198
00:09:24,968 --> 00:09:26,348
Go fuck yourself.

199
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:29,318
All right.
That sounds awesome.

200
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:31,166
Okay.
All right, buddy.

201
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:34,559
- What happened?
- What did he say?

202
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,022
- We're just gonna keep plugging away.
- Come on, Ari. I can take it.

203
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:42,971
He said that he'll pay
350 for the script...

204
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:44,975
Without you.

205
00:09:48,193 --> 00:09:50,200
Jesus. What do you want me to do?

206
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,933
Sell it. Take care of your writers.

207
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:56,226
Do not sell it. We still have
five meetings left, all right?

208
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,564
And we now have a bidding war
which you can use to stall.

209
00:09:58,684 --> 00:10:00,770
So stall.
I will sell this for you, Vinnie.

210
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,617
I've got to go deal with Amanda.

211
00:10:02,737 --> 00:10:04,756
It's okay, you go ahead.
I'll roll with Ari.

212
00:10:04,876 --> 00:10:06,983
And we will return
from the war heroes, Vinnie.

213
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:09,633
- I promise you.
- I don't have Steve Parles's number.

214
00:10:09,753 --> 00:10:11,791
You just heard the offer
from me, dopey.

215
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,909
Do you need a certified letter from him
to work over Amanda? Just do it.

216
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:17,572
Thank you.

217
00:10:18,295 --> 00:10:20,305
But still, I have to say
your character Quinn

218
00:10:20,425 --> 00:10:22,375
is one we don't really
know that much about yet.

219
00:10:22,547 --> 00:10:24,585
Are you saying
I don't get enough screen time?

220
00:10:24,822 --> 00:10:26,596
- We see plenty of you.
- Too much.

221
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:29,423
Asshole.

222
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:32,510
But you are the tough guy
with no girl. What's that?

223
00:10:32,727 --> 00:10:35,137
Think they'll ever give you
a relationship on the show?

224
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:37,186
I think they'd like to leave it unseen.

225
00:10:37,306 --> 00:10:39,934
Like I basically have a stable
of women around town.

226
00:10:40,094 --> 00:10:41,519
Is that how it is in real life?

227
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:45,128
- Well...
- You more of a one-woman type guy?

228
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:47,165
He's more of a no-woman guy.

229
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:51,654
So, Johnny, is there anything
you want to share with us?

230
00:10:52,123 --> 00:10:53,579
He just got dumped.

231
00:10:55,109 --> 00:10:56,617
Drama's gonna hit this kid.

232
00:10:56,777 --> 00:10:58,619
I didn't get dumped.
Take it easy, Brandon.

233
00:10:58,905 --> 00:11:01,020
Okay, you didn't get dumped.
So...

234
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:04,491
tell us what happened. Give us
a little Dr. Phil moment or something.

235
00:11:05,385 --> 00:11:08,015
Sorry, Whoopi, no moment to be had.

236
00:11:08,956 --> 00:11:12,007
It's just tough for a celebrity
to date a civilian is all.

237
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:13,978
They don't get the lifestyle.

238
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:16,624
And inevitably you have no
choice but to cut them loose.

239
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:18,639
Don't believe him.
He's devastated.

240
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,848
He's got pictures of this girl
wallpapering his trailer.

241
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:24,030
Enough, Brandon.
I'm not playing.

242
00:11:24,689 --> 00:11:26,772
Wow, Johnny,
you really are the muscle.

243
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:28,635
Just tell us what really happened.

244
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,994
We're here for you.
Everyone wants to know, right?

245
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:34,894
No.

246
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:41,203
I was a little possessive, I suppose,
so she ended it. It's no big thing.

247
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:43,394
I thought you said you ended it.

248
00:11:43,514 --> 00:11:45,161
Yeah, well, it was mutual.

249
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,054
- We both had our reasons.
- Right, cool.

250
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,003
- I'm fine.
- He's not fine.

251
00:11:49,824 --> 00:11:52,229
Well, look, in case she's watching,

252
00:11:52,563 --> 00:11:56,306
why don't you use this forum
to tell her--

253
00:11:56,545 --> 00:11:58,413
- What's her name?
- Jacqueline.

254
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:01,994
Tell jacqueline how you feel
and what you're thinking.

255
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:03,938
- What the fuck is this?
- I don't think so.

256
00:12:04,803 --> 00:12:06,812
- Come on, Johnny.
- I'd rather not.

257
00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:08,249
- Come on, Johnny.

258
00:12:12,753 --> 00:12:15,625
Brandon was kind enough
to bring a picture of Jacqueline here.

259
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:18,615
- We have a photo. There she is.
- This is a setup?

260
00:12:18,735 --> 00:12:20,953
- Isn't she lovely?
- She's cute.

261
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,958
Come on, why don't you
talk to her, John?

262
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:24,538
Right there, talk to her.

263
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,625
Hey, baby.

264
00:12:30,088 --> 00:12:33,381
I just want to say I'm sorry
I was a little overprotective.

265
00:12:35,427 --> 00:12:36,610
And I Miss you.

266
00:12:38,045 --> 00:12:39,678
I Miss hearing your voice.

267
00:12:40,138 --> 00:12:41,680
I Miss hearing you laugh.

268
00:12:42,115 --> 00:12:43,340
This is horrifying.

269
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:45,768
- Don't fucking cry.
- I love you, baby.

270
00:12:46,797 --> 00:12:49,669
I Miss you being the last thing
I say good night to.

271
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:52,191
I just want to say I love you, baby.

272
00:12:53,827 --> 00:12:54,807
Tweet.

273
00:12:56,915 --> 00:12:57,826
Tweet?

274
00:12:58,381 --> 00:13:00,051
What is tweet?

275
00:13:00,856 --> 00:13:02,414
It's just something we say.

276
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,127
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

277
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:06,674
Fuck!

278
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:11,385
He would have been better off
yakking on them.

279
00:13:11,505 --> 00:13:13,421
- Let's go. Fuck this.
- Disaster.

280
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,610
- Will you calm down?
- Don't you dare tell me to calm down.

281
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,288
You said I had this exclusively.

282
00:13:18,408 --> 00:13:20,886
I told you that I gave it
to Vince first. He changed his mind.

283
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:22,705
Fuck Vince and fuck Ari.

284
00:13:22,825 --> 00:13:25,905
I put my ass on the line
and gave it to Edward fucking Norton.

285
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:28,769
I've never heard you curse before.

286
00:13:31,837 --> 00:13:33,306
Just tell me what you want.

287
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:35,510
Look, I'm being as upfront
with you as I possibly can.

288
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,649
My writers want 500 gs and a guarantee
that the movie gets made.

289
00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:40,676
- That's ridiculous.
- I told them that.

290
00:13:40,796 --> 00:13:43,367
- But that's what they want.
- And Parles is gonna give them that?

291
00:13:43,934 --> 00:13:46,036
- He's getting closer.
- With Vince starring?

292
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,411
Where's he at?

293
00:13:50,856 --> 00:13:53,085
- Come on.
- So now you're coy?

294
00:13:53,245 --> 00:13:55,408
One second you're honest abe
with little rosy cheeks,

295
00:13:55,528 --> 00:13:57,637
the next you can't let
your slippery little tongue--

296
00:13:57,757 --> 00:13:59,341
- I don't want to be abused.
- Look,

297
00:14:00,163 --> 00:14:01,816
Edward wants this project.

298
00:14:01,936 --> 00:14:04,465
But he is buying it without a studio
and he wants it at a price.

299
00:14:04,585 --> 00:14:06,685
How much is he gonna get paid
if the movie gets made?

300
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,767
- How is that relevant?
- If he gets his quote...

301
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:11,187
And then?
Your writers should get theirs?

302
00:14:11,656 --> 00:14:14,982
Your writers don't have a quote.
They don't have a pot to piss in.

303
00:14:15,142 --> 00:14:17,297
Edward Norton
is an Academy Award nominee

304
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:20,488
who wants to take their very raw script
and turn it into something special.

305
00:14:21,124 --> 00:14:23,084
If you want to go
and sell it to the first person

306
00:14:23,204 --> 00:14:25,159
with deep pockets
for Vincent Chase, be my guest.

307
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:27,866
It'll be a piece of shit
like the last movie you guys made.

308
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,231
You're a cold bitch, huh?

309
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:32,333
But here are the facts.
I've got a better offer.

310
00:14:32,493 --> 00:14:34,689
You've got a conflict of interest
because you represent Ed

311
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:37,505
and you're trying to sell the script.
But you lowballed us and you know it.

312
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:39,799
So take it back to Ed
and tell him what we want.

313
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:42,218
The whole naivete thing
is just an act, isn't it?

314
00:14:42,469 --> 00:14:44,695
You know just a little more
than you let on.

315
00:14:44,815 --> 00:14:46,120
Well, know this:

316
00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:49,308
Edward Norton is not getting
into a bidding war.

317
00:14:49,468 --> 00:14:50,867
- Amanda.
- We're out.

318
00:14:52,721 --> 00:14:53,737
Fuck off.

319
00:14:56,097 --> 00:14:57,816
You know the respect we have for you.

320
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,610
<i>We did Head On together</i>.

321
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,154
It was great for you
and it was great for us, okay?

322
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,627
This movie is too expensive
for us to finance with you in the lead.

323
00:15:05,747 --> 00:15:07,868
I totally understand,
and I appreciate the honesty.

324
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:10,688
I actually would prefer
if you lied to us,

325
00:15:10,808 --> 00:15:13,139
like every other dick head in this town,
but very refreshing.

326
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:15,195
- Thank you.
- Okay, thank you.

327
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:17,711
- Listen to me. You'll be back, buddy.
- Tom, thank you.

328
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:20,422
This is not forever, right?
You'll be back.

329
00:15:20,582 --> 00:15:22,591
Once a star
always a threat, buddy.

330
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,100
Good to see you.

331
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,844
- Thank you so much.
- Thanks.

332
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,455
0 for seven.
That can't be good.

333
00:15:32,826 --> 00:15:33,561
What?

334
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:35,935
It's so bad you can't even spin it?

335
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,399
Try and spin it.

336
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,556
It will turn for us,
I promise you.

337
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:43,005
- No spinning.
- We have to make it turn.

338
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,459
I am trying.

339
00:15:45,973 --> 00:15:48,099
- Have you read the script?
- Which one?

340
00:15:48,219 --> 00:15:50,494
- "Smokejumpers."
- Yes, I told you I read it.

341
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:52,974
Most of it.

342
00:15:53,558 --> 00:15:56,138
- You know the part of Ray?
- The brother.

343
00:15:57,629 --> 00:15:58,891
It's a good part.

344
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,259
It's not the lead.

345
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:03,418
I'm not getting leads.

346
00:16:03,538 --> 00:16:05,236
It's a good part in a good movie.

347
00:16:05,356 --> 00:16:08,041
It'd be good for me to be part
of a good movie, right?

348
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:13,705
That was so fucking humiliating.

349
00:16:13,825 --> 00:16:16,328
I can't believe the girls of <i>The View</i>
would set him up like that.

350
00:16:16,448 --> 00:16:18,700
- Sneaky bitches.
- They said they won't cut it?

351
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,186
Damage done.
It already aired on the east coast.

352
00:16:21,306 --> 00:16:22,923
Women will probably love it though.

353
00:16:23,043 --> 00:16:25,372
I don't care about <i>The View</i>'s audience.
I care about Drama's.

354
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:27,838
If you don't think that
all those women watching the show

355
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,951
are gonna tell their teenage kids
that he's a fucking pussy, you're crazy.

356
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,496
- At least it wasn't Vince.
- He should be so fucking lucky. Get in.

357
00:16:35,506 --> 00:16:36,664
Hey, buddy.

358
00:16:39,251 --> 00:16:41,386
Too late to cut your meltdown, Drama.

359
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:45,201
Who gives a shit?
It was from the heart. It was truthful.

360
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,509
Oh Jesus.
How many bottles is that?

361
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,764
I lost count shortly after takeoff.

362
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:53,515
- Let's get him home.
- Why?

363
00:16:54,122 --> 00:16:57,217
What is there for me there?
I got no girl, no love.

364
00:16:57,698 --> 00:16:58,979
I got nothing.

365
00:17:00,768 --> 00:17:02,874
When I came into this world
I had nothing.

366
00:17:02,994 --> 00:17:04,518
Now I'm right back to it.

367
00:17:04,638 --> 00:17:06,936
I left everything
I had up on that stage

368
00:17:07,686 --> 00:17:10,401
- except the clothes on my back.
- Maybe you should have left those too.

369
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:12,584
It would have been
far more interesting.

370
00:17:12,704 --> 00:17:14,345
Maybe I should have.

371
00:17:16,207 --> 00:17:17,331
Maybe I will.

372
00:17:18,446 --> 00:17:20,668
Oh jesus christ, Drama.
Keep your clothes on.

373
00:17:21,112 --> 00:17:23,003
- What are you doing?
- What the fuck?

374
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:25,750
I got nothing!

375
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,884
- Would you get back in the car?
- Do you hear me, world?

376
00:17:29,044 --> 00:17:31,345
Mr. Chase, please get back in the car.

377
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,013
I got nothing, world!

378
00:17:37,696 --> 00:17:39,111
Here, take my pants.

379
00:17:39,356 --> 00:17:40,646
Get in the fucking car.

380
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:43,190
Oh my god.

381
00:17:45,318 --> 00:17:47,385
- Did you see Johnny on <i>The View</i>?
- How was it?

382
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:48,672
Interesting.

383
00:17:49,457 --> 00:17:52,129
You looked stressed. What's the matter?
Amanda playing too rough for you?

384
00:17:52,249 --> 00:17:54,836
'cause I can call her and tell her
to pick on someone her own size.

385
00:17:54,956 --> 00:17:57,155
I lost Ed Norton.
Please tell me you got something.

386
00:17:57,275 --> 00:17:58,454
You lost Ed Norton?

387
00:17:58,574 --> 00:18:00,970
I actually overestimated
your negotiating skills.

388
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,901
No, he's right, I screwed up.

389
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:05,836
I didn't set my clients straight.
Please tell me you guys did better.

390
00:18:05,956 --> 00:18:08,287
Yeah, we did better.
We did a whole lot better.

391
00:18:08,407 --> 00:18:09,422
You got an offer?

392
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:13,083
500 gs from Steve Parles
for your writers just like you wanted.

393
00:18:13,203 --> 00:18:15,222
- Really?
- Yup. And Vince is in.

394
00:18:15,832 --> 00:18:18,058
- And Vince is in?
- Playing the brother, Ray.

395
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,936
- You're not gonna be the lead?
- Nope.

396
00:18:21,096 --> 00:18:23,019
- You okay with that?
- It was his idea.

397
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:25,826
- It's a great role.
- It's gonna be a great movie.

398
00:18:25,946 --> 00:18:28,308
- Is it okay for him?
- It's what's necessary right now.

399
00:18:28,428 --> 00:18:30,320
- And we got you the 500 gs.
- Yup.

400
00:18:31,031 --> 00:18:34,076
- This is unbelievable. It really is.
- Say "thank you, Ari."

401
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:37,423
Come on.
Say "thank you, Ari."

402
00:18:37,543 --> 00:18:39,788
- Thank you, Ari. I appreciate it.
- Come here...

403
00:18:39,948 --> 00:18:41,074
I love it.

404
00:18:43,232 --> 00:18:44,434
Thanks, Vince.

405
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:47,831
It's actually my writers.

406
00:18:47,951 --> 00:18:50,413
- Tell them the good news.
- Think Jed and Clevis will go for it?

407
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:52,573
Or are they gonna want
to direct now too?

408
00:18:53,552 --> 00:18:55,804
Where've you been?
We've been waiting on pins and needles.

409
00:18:55,964 --> 00:18:57,973
- LB.
- You don't answer your phone.

410
00:18:58,133 --> 00:19:00,934
I sent you like 25 emails.
What are we paying you for?

411
00:19:01,288 --> 00:19:03,312
- I got you your offer.
- He got us an offer.

412
00:19:03,472 --> 00:19:06,064
500,000 just like you wanted
and Vince is gonna play the second lead.

413
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:09,034
- I think I love you, E.
- What's he saying? What's he saying?

414
00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:12,229
Vince and Ed Norton and 500 gs.

415
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:13,850
Oh my God!

416
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:17,159
No Ed Norton.
Ed Norton's out.

417
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:19,703
- Ed norton's out.
- Wait, why is Ed Norton out?

418
00:19:20,165 --> 00:19:21,544
Why is Ed Norton out?

419
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:23,957
E, Nick here.
Why is Ed Norton out?

420
00:19:24,506 --> 00:19:27,900
His people didn't want of a bidding war
and sometimes you just can't push.

421
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,506
But don't we pay you to know
how hard to push? I mean, come on.

422
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,198
You haven't paid me anything yet and
I just made you half a million.

423
00:19:33,318 --> 00:19:34,578
I know, I know.

424
00:19:34,698 --> 00:19:37,358
But, you know,
we got all amped on Ed Norton today.

425
00:19:37,478 --> 00:19:39,094
We watched his movie, uh--

426
00:19:39,214 --> 00:19:42,184
- He was so great in <i>American History X</i>.
- <i>American History X</i>.

427
00:19:42,344 --> 00:19:44,116
<i>I mean, the guy he's a good actor.</i>

428
00:19:44,236 --> 00:19:47,731
Yeah, he is. And so is Vince and
he's the one you initially wanted, so...

429
00:19:47,891 --> 00:19:50,542
Actually, that letter that we sent you
we sent to pretty much everybody.

430
00:19:50,662 --> 00:19:52,421
You were just the only one
that responded.

431
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:53,570
Are you happy?

432
00:19:57,176 --> 00:19:58,986
Come on.
Today you live with your mother,

433
00:19:59,106 --> 00:20:01,128
tomorrow you don't have to.
Tell me you're happy.

434
00:20:01,248 --> 00:20:02,912
Yeah, I'm happy.
I'm happy.

435
00:20:03,032 --> 00:20:05,332
I just-- you know,
Ed Norton. I mean...

436
00:20:05,665 --> 00:20:07,780
I'm accepting the deal.
Say thank you.

437
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,046
Okay, thank you, E.

438
00:20:11,331 --> 00:20:13,173
Thank you.
Here, say thank you.

439
00:20:14,468 --> 00:20:15,342
Thank you, E.

440
00:20:15,502 --> 00:20:17,903
All right, you're welcome.
I'll talk to you later. Done deal.

441
00:20:18,023 --> 00:20:20,013
We'll call them in the morning.
Good news, Lloyd.

442
00:20:20,323 --> 00:20:22,727
Vince will have a new movie poster
for you to whack off to soon.

443
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,597
Oh, that's great news.
Congrats, Vince.

444
00:20:24,717 --> 00:20:27,587
But Turtle's on the phone. He says
neither of you will pick up your cells.

445
00:20:27,707 --> 00:20:30,274
- My ringer's off. What's up?
- It's Drama.

446
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:32,888
What about him?

447
00:20:33,008 --> 00:20:34,057
Victory!

448
00:20:37,786 --> 00:20:39,291
Your target demographic.

449
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,159
You all right?

450
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:43,495
Another incarceration on my record.

451
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:47,513
But at least I'm reminded of
the soothing touch of a beautiful woman.

452
00:20:48,012 --> 00:20:50,669
He's all yours.
When am I gonna see you in a new movie?

453
00:20:51,107 --> 00:20:52,265
Pretty soon, I think.

454
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:55,607
One brother gets out of movie-star jail
the other one just gets out of jail.

455
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,967
- You got a movie, bro?
- Looks like it.

456
00:20:58,087 --> 00:20:59,904
There is justice in this world.

457
00:21:00,024 --> 00:21:01,929
There is more than that, Johnny Drama.

458
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:04,144
I've spoken to many of my friends today

459
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,268
and they loved
your performance on <i>The View</i>.

460
00:21:06,463 --> 00:21:08,979
Think they'll love whacking it
to his mug shot as well?

461
00:21:09,154 --> 00:21:10,355
Great image. Nice.

462
00:21:10,515 --> 00:21:11,859
Can we got to villa, bro?

463
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,025
I need to drown my sorrows
in some pussy.

464
00:21:14,338 --> 00:21:15,563
You got it.

465
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,906
My favorite female agent.
How are you?

466
00:21:19,222 --> 00:21:20,449
Let's stick to business.

467
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:23,118
- Do we have any business to stick to?
- <i>Edward's back in</i>

468
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:26,243
- and he's bringing a studio with him.
- I'm about to make a deal.

469
00:21:26,363 --> 00:21:29,392
The offer's $1 million
against $2 million for the script.

470
00:21:31,334 --> 00:21:33,962
- What is it?
- I need Vince the second lead.

471
00:21:35,282 --> 00:21:36,048
What?

472
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,425
Vince is Ray the brother
or I can't close.

473
00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:40,883
Alan Gray is buying it, E.

474
00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:44,422
Not sure how your relationship is with
him since he fired Vince off <i>Aquaman</i>.

475
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:45,843
<i>But you can call.</i>

476
00:21:45,963 --> 00:21:47,935
<i>In the meantime
call your writers and tell them</i>

477
00:21:48,095 --> 00:21:50,812
they have Edward Norton
and a $2 million offer.

478
00:21:51,164 --> 00:21:53,034
I'm sure they'll want to close.

479
00:21:58,089 --> 00:21:59,530
What did she say?
