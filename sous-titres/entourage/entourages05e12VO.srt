5x12 - Return To Queens Blvd

00:01:07,022 --> 00:01:08,892
Subtitles: sub-way.fr

3
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:30,885
- Come on, let's do another shot.
- I can't.

4
00:01:31,262 --> 00:01:34,714
I've got a 10:00 a.m. meeting.
If I Miss it I can kiss partner goodbye.

5
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:36,604
- You'll call me?
- Definitely.

6
00:01:37,845 --> 00:01:39,674
- Partner?
- She's a lawyer.

7
00:01:40,454 --> 00:01:43,778
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but was that lawyer giving you a tug?

8
00:01:43,898 --> 00:01:47,064
In L.A. you can only get an actress
or a hooker to do that.

9
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,094
God, I love this
motherfucking town!

10
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:51,897
Hear hear.

11
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:00,952
Oh, man.

12
00:02:02,827 --> 00:02:05,310
- Should we get breakfast?
- No, we'll eat at home.

13
00:02:05,897 --> 00:02:07,751
- Train?
- Cab, please.

14
00:02:07,957 --> 00:02:09,149
I'm exhausted.

15
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:12,579
Yeah, sitting in a booth all night
getting no puss can be draining.

16
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:13,955
Right here.

17
00:02:17,862 --> 00:02:19,601
- Where to?
- Queens, please.

18
00:02:37,613 --> 00:02:39,401
You elbowed me right in the face.

19
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:40,693
Good ride.

20
00:02:42,378 --> 00:02:44,679
Make sure
that cheap bastard tips you.

21
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:46,551
Thank you.

22
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:53,683
- I'm starving.
- I smell bacon.

23
00:02:54,054 --> 00:02:55,575
Ma, what are you doing up?

24
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:57,589
Well, sorry, I couldn't sleep

25
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:00,321
thinking of you all lying
in a ditch somewhere.

26
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:02,519
We're grown men.
Nothing's gonna happen to us.

27
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:04,979
Oh yeah? You keep partying
like this at your age

28
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:07,009
you're gonna have
a heart attack, Johnny.

29
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:08,406
It's true.
She's right.

30
00:03:08,526 --> 00:03:10,851
And you go home.
Your mother's worried too.

31
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:13,544
- I can't stay for breakfast?
- She doesn't cook for you anymore?

32
00:03:13,664 --> 00:03:15,456
Sadly my mom's cooking
has gone to shit.

33
00:03:15,576 --> 00:03:17,737
- And it started at crap.
- Be nice to your mother.

34
00:03:17,857 --> 00:03:19,716
Easy for you to say.
Your mom's in Florida.

35
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,267
- It's like she can smell me.
- I saw your cab pull up.

36
00:03:23,387 --> 00:03:26,000
What kind of an animal
doesn't come home till sunrise?

37
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:28,670
- Four nights in a row.
- We're on vacation, ma.

38
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,089
Get your fat ass home.

39
00:03:31,903 --> 00:03:33,508
- Right now.
- I'm coming.

40
00:03:34,144 --> 00:03:36,671
- Get your fat ass home, Turtle.
- Shut up, Drama.

41
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,286
- You okay ma?
- I'm worried about you.

42
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:44,334
You party all night,
you sleep all day.

43
00:03:44,454 --> 00:03:47,044
How are you gonna get a job
carrying on like that?

44
00:03:47,164 --> 00:03:48,973
It's always worked before.

45
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:52,861
I'm okay, ma.

46
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:55,572
Is he?
Is he okay?

47
00:03:56,253 --> 00:03:58,652
You're the mastermind
behind all this. You tell me.

48
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,452
We've hit a bit of a rough patch,
but we'll be okay.

49
00:04:01,612 --> 00:04:03,938
You know,
I read in <i>The Post</i> this morning

50
00:04:04,058 --> 00:04:07,208
that Gus Van Sant is in town
working on a new movie.

51
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:10,461
What? I thought <i>Good Will Hunting</i>
was very good.

52
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:12,578
I would love to be
in a Gus Van Sant movie,

53
00:04:12,698 --> 00:04:15,431
but I have an agent and a manager
who are on top of these things.

54
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:16,933
Are you on top of this thing?

55
00:04:17,053 --> 00:04:19,214
I read the script months ago
when Vince wasn't available.

56
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:21,621
- It's totally cast now.
- Not anymore.

57
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,272
Joaquin Phoenix
broke his arm

58
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,978
and Gus
is looking for a replacement.

59
00:04:27,138 --> 00:04:28,874
I would love to work with Gus.

60
00:04:28,994 --> 00:04:30,148
<i>Milk</i> was dope.

61
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:31,939
It's a great role.

62
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:35,463
- I'll call Ari.
- Maybe I'm not so useless after all.

63
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,242
Gus doesn't think he's right for it.

64
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,036
- How do you know?
- <i>Because</i>

65
00:04:43,196 --> 00:04:45,580
unlike you my workday
starts before reading page six.

66
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:47,456
- What's he saying?
- He spoke to Gus.

67
00:04:47,576 --> 00:04:50,160
He doesn't think
you're right for the part. Hold on.

68
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:53,523
Vinnie, how goes it?

69
00:04:53,643 --> 00:04:55,331
Not well.
My mom's all over me.

70
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:57,499
She's treating me
like she usually treats Johnny.

71
00:04:57,619 --> 00:04:58,760
I'm sorry about that.

72
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,511
So what exactly did gus say?

73
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:03,405
Listen, gus says he loves
you but just not for this.

74
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:05,957
All right, what did he really say?

75
00:05:06,704 --> 00:05:08,026
He's not a fan.

76
00:05:09,095 --> 00:05:10,361
He's not a fan.

77
00:05:11,154 --> 00:05:12,597
Tell him you'll read for it.

78
00:05:12,717 --> 00:05:14,277
- Really?
- You'll make him a fan.

79
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,403
- What's the idiot saying?
- He thinks I should read.

80
00:05:17,688 --> 00:05:19,771
Vinnie, you haven't
auditioned in years.

81
00:05:19,891 --> 00:05:21,491
So what?
You don't think I can?

82
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:24,577
I'm not afraid to audition1.
I can turn him.

83
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:27,538
I like the fire.
I'll set it up.

84
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,227
Great.
Thanks.

85
00:05:29,638 --> 00:05:30,973
Back to basics.

86
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:35,938
I can give you plenty of advice
on how to audition, bro.

87
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:38,355
He needs advice
on how to successfully audition.

88
00:05:39,055 --> 00:05:42,223
I've booked my fair share of jobs, you
jerkoff. 1Including this one right here.

89
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:44,462
One in a million's
not the odds we're looking for.

90
00:05:44,582 --> 00:05:46,808
Vince knows how to audition.
He had to start somewhere.

91
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:48,407
I don't want to talk about it.

92
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:50,256
Let's just go say hi
to aunt Darcy for ma

93
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:52,537
and then we'll hit Don Pepe's
for some baked clams, okay?

94
00:05:52,657 --> 00:05:54,899
You can't just say hi to aunt Darcy.

95
00:05:56,697 --> 00:05:58,176
Welcome home!

96
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:00,947
Oh my god.
Ma, how did you beat us here?

97
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,865
I'm sneaky like that.

98
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:06,801
So how's it feel to be back home?

99
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:09,299
Are you kidding? I always love
coming home and seeing everybody.

100
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:12,008
- We're all so proud of you.
- Even when your movie get shit reviews,

101
00:06:12,128 --> 00:06:13,734
- we're still proud, Vinnie.

102
00:06:14,243 --> 00:06:15,743
Would you excuse me for a second?

103
00:06:15,863 --> 00:06:18,085
So when are we gonna see
you in another good movie?

104
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:20,284
- Soon, I hope.
- Very soon.

105
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:23,678
Let's just say he may be staring
in Gus Van Sant's new movie.

106
00:06:23,978 --> 00:06:26,763
- Oh, nice.
- Drama, you gonna be in that movie too?

107
00:06:27,191 --> 00:06:30,518
The closest he's getting to Gus Van Sant
is whacking it to <i>My Own Private Idaho</i>.

108
00:06:30,678 --> 00:06:33,144
Watch that mouth
or I'll wash it out with Palmolive.

109
00:06:33,264 --> 00:06:35,079
- Would you stop?
- Hear hear, shut up.

110
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,903
Get off that thing.
You're at a party.

111
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:39,488
- Who do you keep texting with?
- Nobody.

112
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:41,863
I'm gonna get some air.
You guys are crazy.

113
00:06:42,353 --> 00:06:44,058
He won't even let him audition?

114
00:06:44,178 --> 00:06:46,260
He said he doesn't want
to waste anyone's time.

115
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,171
I don't even know
how to tell Vince that.

116
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,776
You knew how to tell him
to read before checking with me.

117
00:06:50,896 --> 00:06:53,041
You've got to get Gus
to do you a favor and see him.

118
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:55,609
A favor to cover up your fuck up
or a favor for Vince?

119
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:57,377
For Vince.
He needs this right now.

120
00:06:57,497 --> 00:06:59,329
He might not be showing it,
but he's hurting.

121
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:01,208
That sucks,
but there are certain realities

122
00:07:01,328 --> 00:07:03,098
we need to face up to in this life.

123
00:07:03,218 --> 00:07:06,678
And one of them is that Vince
ain't getting in a gus van sant movie.

124
00:07:07,662 --> 00:07:08,998
Will you call Gus back?

125
00:07:09,118 --> 00:07:11,559
- No, I won't.
- Fine, then I fucking will.

126
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:14,351
- Leave me alone.
- Who you talking to?

127
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:15,810
Maybe it's a girl.

128
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,071
- Impossible.
- Why?

129
00:07:17,191 --> 00:07:19,003
We all want to know
who you're talking to.

130
00:07:19,123 --> 00:07:20,825
But I will give it to
the highest bidder.

131
00:07:20,945 --> 00:07:22,823
- 50 bucks.
- Give me the berry, Ronnie.

132
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,596
- Sold.
- Give it to me.

133
00:07:24,716 --> 00:07:26,033
He deleted everything.

134
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:28,067
You don't think I know
how to cover my tracks?

135
00:07:28,187 --> 00:07:29,383
You still owe me 50.

136
00:07:29,503 --> 00:07:31,841
Take it off my tab
from the last time you lost me money.

137
00:07:31,961 --> 00:07:34,462
You still can't be mad.
I got opportunities for you.

138
00:07:34,582 --> 00:07:37,277
- I'm not even hearing you.
- We'll talk tonight.

139
00:07:37,976 --> 00:07:39,590
Can I get a rum and coke?

140
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:42,138
Look who it is.

141
00:07:42,258 --> 00:07:44,757
You didn't think I'd miss the
one-who-got-away's homecoming parade.

142
00:07:44,877 --> 00:07:46,725
I'm glad you didn't.
How are you doing, Cara?

143
00:07:46,845 --> 00:07:48,207
I'm good.
How are you?

144
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:49,388
I'm great.

145
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:51,789
Hey, cara.
How you been?

146
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:54,087
Great.
Really great now that I can get

147
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,896
my once-every-five-years update
on how my old crew is doing.

148
00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:58,318
What did Ari say?

149
00:07:58,438 --> 00:08:00,274
- You want to--
- That's okay.

150
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,461
Gus won't see you.

151
00:08:05,456 --> 00:08:07,101
He won't even let me read?

152
00:08:11,286 --> 00:08:13,007
All right, fuck Hollywood.

153
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:15,192
You know what?
Let's go have some old school fun.

154
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:17,534
You guys go. I'm gonna go
into the city and see Gus.

155
00:08:17,654 --> 00:08:18,932
- Come on.
- What?

156
00:08:19,052 --> 00:08:21,419
You gonna go knock on his door
and beg him to let me audition?

157
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,881
- I tried calling him.
- If Ari couldn't do it, forget it.

158
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,884
- Do you want to do this movie or not?
- I did this morning but this is stupid.

159
00:08:27,086 --> 00:08:28,302
Well, let me try.

160
00:08:29,347 --> 00:08:31,139
- Okay, try.
- Thank you.

161
00:08:31,394 --> 00:08:33,831
I'll see you later. Have fun.
It was good to see you, Cara.

162
00:08:40,428 --> 00:08:42,483
- Mr. Murphy.
- Hi.

163
00:08:42,603 --> 00:08:44,175
Shawn, we spoke on the phone.

164
00:08:44,786 --> 00:08:46,177
Is Gus around?

165
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,114
As I told you on the phone,

166
00:08:48,234 --> 00:08:50,703
Mr. Van sant doesn't have time
to talk with you today. So sorry.

167
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:53,171
I totally understand. Actually,
I don't even need to talk.

168
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,789
I just wanted to give him these
Vincent Chase movies to look at.

169
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:57,803
- I picked these up.
- I'll give them to him.

170
00:08:57,923 --> 00:09:00,210
Do you think I can
give them to him personally?

171
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:03,617
He's not in right now
and he might not be back for hours.

172
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,756
That's okay. I don't mind waiting.
I won't bother anyone, I promise.

173
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:08,358
- Great.
- Thanks.

174
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,646
You know I got fired
off my last movie?

175
00:09:17,303 --> 00:09:18,310
I know.

176
00:09:18,742 --> 00:09:20,521
- Who told you?
- <i>Us Weekly</i>.

177
00:09:21,164 --> 00:09:22,664
You read <i>Us Weekly</i>?

178
00:09:22,972 --> 00:09:24,431
A future M.B.A.?

179
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:26,300
God, that is so sad.

180
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:31,549
I don't know what's gonna happen.

181
00:09:32,952 --> 00:09:35,393
I just know I can't take
another year like this.

182
00:09:35,513 --> 00:09:36,844
What does E say?

183
00:09:38,075 --> 00:09:39,595
E says a lot of things.

184
00:09:39,821 --> 00:09:42,267
I just don't know
who I should listen to anymore.

185
00:09:42,387 --> 00:09:43,878
Just listen to yourself.

186
00:09:48,584 --> 00:09:50,221
You don't believe in appointments?

187
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:51,886
Mr. Van Sant, how are you?

188
00:09:52,202 --> 00:09:55,556
Sorry to drop in on you like this.
If I could have f5 minutes of your time.

189
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:58,035
Walk with me,
but only 'cause Ari's a friend.

190
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:03,044
So what didn't I make clear to Ari
that I should make clear to you now?

191
00:10:03,164 --> 00:10:05,037
Nothing, but I know
Vince can do this part.

192
00:10:05,157 --> 00:10:07,318
And I know he can't,
so where does that leave us?

193
00:10:07,438 --> 00:10:09,537
If you just looked
at some of his work you'd see it.

194
00:10:09,657 --> 00:10:11,734
- I've seen all of his work.
- Probably not all of it.

195
00:10:11,854 --> 00:10:13,355
- You've seen <i>Head On</i>?
- Saw it.

196
00:10:13,475 --> 00:10:14,506
<i>Queen's Boulevard</i>?

197
00:10:14,626 --> 00:10:16,972
Not a lot of people saw that
but it was an amazing performance.

198
00:10:17,092 --> 00:10:19,291
At sundance the <i>New York Times</i>
said he might win an oscar.

199
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,181
- But he didn't.
- No, he didn't.

200
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:23,113
- And I saw it.
- What about <i>Aquaman</i>?

201
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:25,250
Everyone saw <i>Aquaman</i>
and I see everything.

202
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,464
What about the scenes
from the last movie he shot?

203
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:28,931
I know you didn't see those.

204
00:10:29,051 --> 00:10:32,186
So you're gonna sell me on Vince
based on a $120 million film

205
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:34,734
that was shut down because
the director didn't like his work?

206
00:10:34,854 --> 00:10:36,555
Look, I know he can do this.

207
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:39,350
Please,
just take a look at the scenes.

208
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:43,585
- So you're kind of desperate?
- It doesn't mean I'm wrong.

209
00:10:44,704 --> 00:10:47,437
Okay, send over some scenes.
I'll take a look.

210
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,670
Thank you.

211
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:55,745
Thank you very much.

212
00:10:59,444 --> 00:11:00,955
You really are an idiot.

213
00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:05,001
Say out loud,
"I am a fucking idiot."

214
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,866
Just call Dana Gordon.

215
00:11:06,986 --> 00:11:08,559
Watch out, man.
What's up?

216
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,100
Have her overnight them.

217
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,009
It's an unreleased disaster.
She'll never let them out.

218
00:11:13,292 --> 00:11:15,264
You got her the job.
You could get her to do it.

219
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,114
I don't want to get her to do it.

220
00:11:17,234 --> 00:11:20,137
<i>Fine. You know what?
You call Gus and you tell him that,</i>

221
00:11:20,257 --> 00:11:22,027
'cause he rearranged
his whole schedule

222
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:24,802
to be there when they arrive
and I told him you were sending them.

223
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,940
Fuck!

224
00:11:31,888 --> 00:11:34,655
- I'm not investing in a bar, Ronnie.
- Think of it this way:

225
00:11:34,815 --> 00:11:37,158
You'll be investing in
the old neighborhood, huh?

226
00:11:37,507 --> 00:11:39,335
Tv star makes good, huh?

227
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,497
Come on, Drama. Think about all the
great times we've had in this place.

228
00:11:43,957 --> 00:11:46,628
'94, game six,
John Starks.

229
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:48,753
Come on, you remember.

230
00:11:48,913 --> 00:11:51,464
I do. And I remember coming here
trying to forget game seven.

231
00:11:51,747 --> 00:11:54,032
This place is still
packed every night.

232
00:11:54,152 --> 00:11:56,802
- So how did Philly fall so behind?
- He's a degenerate gambler.

233
00:11:56,962 --> 00:11:58,930
So why would I want
to invest with him?

234
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,738
He's in the program now.

235
00:12:01,272 --> 00:12:03,321
30 gs and he's back on his feet.

236
00:12:03,441 --> 00:12:05,853
- He won't make the same mistake again.
- Forget it.

237
00:12:06,013 --> 00:12:08,709
Like my last investment with you,
I'll never see my money again.

238
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,256
- Maybe you wouldn't.
- Right.

239
00:12:10,376 --> 00:12:12,769
But I think Philly
might let you change the name.

240
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,587
- What's up, buddy?
- Long day?

241
00:12:22,707 --> 00:12:25,629
Yeah. I waited in Gus's office
for six hours today.

242
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,376
- Does he still hate me?
- He definitely hates me.

243
00:12:28,757 --> 00:12:30,216
Is he gonna let me read or what?

244
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:32,250
He's watching
the <i>Smokejumpers</i> footage tomorrow.

245
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,751
Ari got Dana Gordon to fedex it to him,
so we still got a shot.

246
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:37,508
- Not a very good one.
- Yeah, but it's still a shot.

247
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:39,744
- Excuse me, buddy.

248
00:12:39,864 --> 00:12:41,806
- Jesus, Turtle.
- Sorry, I've got to--

249
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,310
We want to know
who you're talking to.

250
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,789
Give me the phone.

251
00:12:48,991 --> 00:12:50,981
Come on.
Enough's enough. Who is it?

252
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:54,943
Please don't make me tell you.
Just give me the phone back, please.

253
00:12:55,063 --> 00:12:56,464
Oh no no no.

254
00:12:58,549 --> 00:13:01,033
- Turtle's phone.
- Hello? Who's this?

255
00:13:01,686 --> 00:13:03,411
- It's a girl.
- His mother?

256
00:13:05,002 --> 00:13:07,038
Can I tell Turtle who's calling?

257
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:08,791
It's jamie, Drama.

258
00:13:09,946 --> 00:13:10,861
Really?

259
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:12,649
Are you guys giving
Turtle a hard time?

260
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:14,588
No no.
It's all in good fun.

261
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:16,257
Whatever.
We're fucking.

262
00:13:16,803 --> 00:13:18,529
<i>So can I please just talk to him?</i>

263
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:20,481
Yeah yeah.
Of course.

264
00:13:21,546 --> 00:13:22,882
It's Jamie-Lynn.

265
00:13:23,478 --> 00:13:26,704
They're fucking and I'm gonna
jump off the Triborough bridge.

266
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:30,563
Hey, sorry about that.
They stole my phone.

267
00:13:31,382 --> 00:13:33,441
Babe, relax.
I don't care.

268
00:13:34,342 --> 00:13:35,616
I just Miss you.

269
00:13:36,142 --> 00:13:37,416
She misses me.

270
00:13:38,757 --> 00:13:40,072
I Miss you too.

271
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:41,613
Phone sex?

272
00:13:43,328 --> 00:13:44,563
I'll go outside.

273
00:13:45,857 --> 00:13:46,905
Seriously.

274
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:48,956
All right.
Who's Jamie-Lynn?

275
00:13:49,116 --> 00:13:51,216
- Sigler from <i>The Sopranos</i>.
- Meadow Soprano.

276
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:55,365
Well, bro,
if Turtle can land Jamie-Lynn,

277
00:13:55,485 --> 00:13:57,708
there's no reason
you can't get a Gus Van Sant movie.

278
00:13:57,828 --> 00:13:59,467
I just hope he lets me read.

279
00:13:59,627 --> 00:14:01,801
There's nothing to hope. He will.

280
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:04,138
You tell Phil

281
00:14:04,304 --> 00:14:07,832
that if this place is henceforth
known as Johnny Drama's,

282
00:14:07,952 --> 00:14:09,397
- I'm in.
- Yeah?

283
00:14:10,657 --> 00:14:12,958
Hey, everyone,
I got an announcement to make.

284
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:15,109
The drinks are on me.

285
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:17,549
Or should I say,

286
00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:19,267
the drinks are on...

287
00:14:20,131 --> 00:14:21,324
The house.

288
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:26,480
Show me the bar, let's go.

289
00:14:27,321 --> 00:14:29,246
How you doing.
Get this guy a drink.

290
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:37,903
The life of an actor--
Waiting around for the phone to ring.

291
00:14:38,652 --> 00:14:41,032
Something kind of exciting
about it, you know?

292
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:45,443
- Pussys.
- Get out of my kitchen, Johnny.

293
00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:47,148
I'm making my famous frittatas.

294
00:14:47,268 --> 00:14:49,974
No, I'm nervous. And when
I'm nervous I have to stay busy.

295
00:14:50,094 --> 00:14:51,852
- Any calls?
- No, nothing yet.

296
00:14:52,012 --> 00:14:53,300
- Relax, ma.
- Look...

297
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,437
Some of us are not used
this kind of thing.

298
00:14:55,557 --> 00:14:58,314
My god, I always thought it was you
I was gonna have to worry about.

299
00:14:58,434 --> 00:15:01,190
- Never Vince.
- He'll be fine, ma. Don't worry.

300
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,520
Morning, Mrs. Chase.

301
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,657
Oh, well,
what have we here?

302
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,164
This is like old times, huh?

303
00:15:09,986 --> 00:15:11,116
E, any calls?

304
00:15:11,486 --> 00:15:13,738
- Don't even ask. Don't even ask.
- Sorry.

305
00:15:14,989 --> 00:15:16,544
Well, now that you did...

306
00:15:17,427 --> 00:15:19,461
- Nothing yet.
- Did you track the package?

307
00:15:19,581 --> 00:15:21,886
- Are you sure he got the movie?
- They're called dailies.

308
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:23,644
Whatever, are you sure he got them?

309
00:15:23,764 --> 00:15:25,719
- Did you track the package?
- I tracked them.

310
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,055
I tracked them.
He definitely got them. Jeez.

311
00:15:28,215 --> 00:15:30,105
Let's just focus
on something else, guys.

312
00:15:30,225 --> 00:15:31,274
Like what?

313
00:15:32,737 --> 00:15:34,145
Turtle's got a girlfriend.

314
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:35,771
No.
Who is she?

315
00:15:36,106 --> 00:15:37,694
Jamie-Lynn Sigler

316
00:15:38,016 --> 00:15:39,236
from <i>The Sopranos</i>.

317
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:40,365
Oh come on.

318
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:42,403
That's why you're my ma.

319
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:44,863
One day you're all
gonna believe in me.

320
00:15:45,214 --> 00:15:46,226
Oh God!

321
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,363
- Ma, just relax.
- It's cute.

322
00:15:48,986 --> 00:15:50,702
- It's a 212 number.
- Pick it up.

323
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,414
- Hey, Eric, what's up?
- Hey, Gus. Did you get the stuff?

324
00:15:55,784 --> 00:15:58,876
I did. I really liked it. Is there
a way to talk to Vince about it?

325
00:15:58,996 --> 00:16:00,458
Yeah. He's right here.

326
00:16:01,653 --> 00:16:03,975
- Put it on speaker.
- Ma, just chill.

327
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,950
Hey, Gus.
How you doing?

328
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,587
Hey, Vince, I'm really glad your crazy
manager got you back on our radar.

329
00:16:11,707 --> 00:16:13,517
- Oh yeah?
- He's a pushy one.

330
00:16:14,178 --> 00:16:15,280
Yeah, he is.

331
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,362
Anyway, I watched your stuff
and I really thought it was great.

332
00:16:18,482 --> 00:16:21,116
You're definitely growing
and definitely have something.

333
00:16:21,236 --> 00:16:22,860
Just not for this movie.

334
00:16:25,698 --> 00:16:27,342
Yeah, no.
I understand.

335
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:30,048
But we should work together
in the future. I mean that.

336
00:16:30,168 --> 00:16:31,710
Thank you.
Bye.

337
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:37,901
- What did he say?
- He said...

338
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,328
I'm on his radar
and we'll work together,

339
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:41,877
just not on this one.

340
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:46,280
All right. At least he appreciates
how good you are.

341
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,194
That's cool.
You'll get the next one.

342
00:16:48,314 --> 00:16:49,341
Fuck!

343
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,417
Sorry.

344
00:16:52,156 --> 00:16:53,225
Sorry, I--

345
00:16:53,718 --> 00:16:55,345
I just need to go for a walk.

346
00:16:55,886 --> 00:16:57,554
- I got it.
- I'll be back.

347
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:05,230
I really don't want to talk
about this right now.

348
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,242
We're gonna be all right.
We jut did a lead.

349
00:17:07,362 --> 00:17:09,441
Things didn't go as we planned,
but its gonna be fine.

350
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,270
You sure?
You're always so fucking sure.

351
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,105
- How do you really know?
- I just do.

352
00:17:13,225 --> 00:17:14,955
Yeah?
Just like you knew about this?

353
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,770
Ari told you no
and you kept pushing.

354
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,946
And now not only did you embarrass
yourself, you embarrassed me.

355
00:17:21,066 --> 00:17:23,371
Embarrassed you?
Gus Van Sant likes you now.

356
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:24,994
You believe him?
Come on.

357
00:17:25,114 --> 00:17:26,589
He won't even let me audition.

358
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,562
Who knows
if he even watched the footage?

359
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:31,089
No, this year we said-- we swore
we were gonna listen to Ari.

360
00:17:31,209 --> 00:17:32,795
And guess what?
Again you didn't.

361
00:17:32,915 --> 00:17:34,978
What am I supposed to do?
Do nothing and stand by

362
00:17:35,098 --> 00:17:37,142
- and hope something magically appears?
- Maybe.

363
00:17:37,392 --> 00:17:38,748
Since you've been my manager,

364
00:17:38,868 --> 00:17:41,045
everything you've pushed for
has gotten me to this point.

365
00:17:41,165 --> 00:17:43,398
Are you serious?
I've been the one working

366
00:17:43,518 --> 00:17:45,678
for you to get you what you
want when no one else cared.

367
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,781
Maybe I needed someone
looking out for my career,

368
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,856
- not my personal interests.
- I was doing both.

369
00:17:49,976 --> 00:17:52,484
Whatever it is you were doing
clearly isn't working

370
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,420
Two years ago I was starring in movies.
Now people won't even let me audition.

371
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,044
One person won't let you audition.

372
00:17:57,164 --> 00:17:58,919
You have to stay positive,
You know that.

373
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,213
Are you serious?

374
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,227
I have done nothing
but stay positive.

375
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,456
I have listened to everything
you've wanted me to do.

376
00:18:04,576 --> 00:18:06,161
And now I got a house
full of people

377
00:18:06,281 --> 00:18:08,278
who can really see what
a failure I've turned into.

378
00:18:08,398 --> 00:18:09,784
- Come on.
- No.

379
00:18:09,904 --> 00:18:11,263
We said when we started this

380
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,644
is was gonna be about the business,
not the friendship.

381
00:18:13,764 --> 00:18:15,139
It's time for a change.

382
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:17,782
You firing me?

383
00:18:17,902 --> 00:18:19,987
The business isn't working, is it?

384
00:18:20,624 --> 00:18:23,415
Whatever. I'm not gonna grovel.
Go find someone better.

385
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:24,936
'cause I can live with myself

386
00:18:25,056 --> 00:18:27,309
knowing I busted my ass
and I gave everything I had to you.

387
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:29,027
I know you did.
But it wasn't enough.

388
00:18:29,257 --> 00:18:30,531
Yeah, fuck you.

389
00:18:40,657 --> 00:18:44,414
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to Los Angeles international airport.</i>

390
00:18:45,203 --> 00:18:48,255
Please make sure that all baggage
is not left unattended.

391
00:19:00,335 --> 00:19:01,363
Drama's.

392
00:19:03,385 --> 00:19:05,230
1I love it.
I love it.

393
00:19:06,118 --> 00:19:08,707
Yo, E.
It's me again.

394
00:19:09,861 --> 00:19:12,370
Look, I don't want this
to affect our friendship.

395
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,669
Nothing is more important
to me than that.

396
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:15,902
1Call me.

397
00:19:18,396 --> 00:19:19,522
Are you wet?

398
00:19:20,091 --> 00:19:22,956
I'm wet and your big cock
is in my mouth.

399
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,657
That's where my big cock
likes to be.

400
00:19:27,377 --> 00:19:29,512
<i>Who are you talking to
like that in my house?</i>

401
00:19:29,632 --> 00:19:31,579
Your father would roll over
in his grave.

402
00:19:31,846 --> 00:19:33,558
I've got to call you back later.

403
00:19:33,678 --> 00:19:35,250
Off the phone now!

404
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,668
God damn it!

405
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:41,257
- E, you're late.
- Everything's fine.

406
00:19:41,377 --> 00:19:42,880
You're nervous.
You ready to go?

407
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,898
I'm psyched to blow
these network freaks away.

408
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,314
You gonna blow Jimmie Kimmel away?

409
00:19:47,888 --> 00:19:49,691
- What do you mean?
- Just got his people.

410
00:19:49,851 --> 00:19:52,572
They want you to do a little standup on
the show to plug the pilot. Cool?

411
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,216
Yeah, boy, it is. What?

412
00:19:54,336 --> 00:19:55,906
All right, let's do this.

413
00:19:57,651 --> 00:19:59,159
- You wanna get that?
- No.

414
00:19:59,512 --> 00:20:01,259
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey hey.

415
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:07,787
- All right.
- You can just keep that. Thank you.

416
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:19,319
Okay, Lloyd,
get him on the phone now.

417
00:20:25,868 --> 00:20:28,230
Jesus, is this what you call
a New York vacation?

418
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,823
Where's the glamour?
Where's the bitches?

419
00:20:30,943 --> 00:20:33,109
- Look who's here.
- Welcome to Johnny Drama's.

420
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:35,112
This must be Ari.

421
00:20:35,272 --> 00:20:36,905
Ari, Cara;
Cara, Ari.

422
00:20:37,065 --> 00:20:39,538
I apologize. I was talking
about these bitches, not you.

423
00:20:39,658 --> 00:20:41,136
Ari, let me get you a beer.

424
00:20:41,256 --> 00:20:43,705
Just make it a quick one 'cause
I got a big meeting tomorrow.

425
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,748
Look at you. It's good to see you.
Nice of you to drop by.

426
00:20:46,908 --> 00:20:49,209
Actually, I've got a little
bit of business as well.

427
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:50,836
Oh yeah?
What's going on?

428
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:52,588
It's right here.

429
00:20:52,954 --> 00:20:54,963
- <i>You got him?</i>
- Indeed I do.

430
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:57,342
Here's Vinnie.

431
00:21:03,832 --> 00:21:05,517
Hey, it's Marty Scorsese.

432
00:21:06,241 --> 00:21:07,936
- Hi. Hello.
- <i>Yeah, listen,</i>

433
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,787
you got a minute to talk?

434
00:21:11,457 --> 00:21:13,191
Yeah.
Indeed I do.

435
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:15,903
Look, Gus was kind enough
to send me some of the rushes

436
00:21:16,023 --> 00:21:18,759
in that picture you were in about
the forest fires or whatever.

437
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:20,853
And I saw them
and I thought you were terrific.

438
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:23,013
I'd love to offer you
a part in my new picture.

439
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:24,156
Really?

440
00:21:24,276 --> 00:21:26,580
It's a reimagining
of <i>The Great Gatsby,</i>

441
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:29,806
modern day set in
the upper west side of New York.

442
00:21:29,926 --> 00:21:32,481
And I think you'd be perfect
for Nick Carraway.

443
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:34,047
<i>What do you think of that?</i>

444
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,260
- Amazing.
- Great.

445
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:37,959
If you'd like to come in
and talk about the details...

446
00:21:38,772 --> 00:21:40,170
See you soon then.

447
00:21:40,545 --> 00:21:42,030
- Thank you.
- Bye.

448
00:21:45,646 --> 00:21:47,625
I'm gonna be in a Scorsese movie.

449
00:21:48,146 --> 00:21:51,605
Correction. You're gonna be
the lead in a fucking Scorsese film.

450
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,205
You talkin' to me?

451
00:21:54,109 --> 00:21:55,904
That's my De Niro.
No good?

452
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:57,404
This is unreal!

453
00:21:58,499 --> 00:22:00,061
Look at that.
Young love, huh?

454
00:22:00,181 --> 00:22:02,494
And it shoot in New York as well,
if that helps.

455
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:03,645
Nice.

456
00:22:05,128 --> 00:22:06,196
Thank you, Ari.

457
00:22:06,316 --> 00:22:08,149
- Thank you.
- You know what? Don't thank me,

458
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:11,458
thank E. For once in his life
the little mcnugget delivered.

459
00:22:12,235 --> 00:22:14,207
Where is the little freak anyway?

460
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,821
Look, it's not flashy, all right?

461
00:22:18,941 --> 00:22:21,163
- But it rides nice.
- And it's practical.

462
00:22:21,283 --> 00:22:23,321
- Still kind of cool.
- Very cool.

463
00:22:24,248 --> 00:22:26,221
If the pilot gets picked up
I'm getting a porsche.

464
00:22:26,341 --> 00:22:28,563
It will get picked up.
But wait till season two

465
00:22:28,683 --> 00:22:31,102
gets the go ahead before
you get the porsche, okay?

466
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,683
- Thanks for everything.
- You're welcome, buddy.

467
00:22:42,323 --> 00:22:43,823
Hey, Jane.
Any calls?

468
00:22:43,943 --> 00:22:47,522
No, but there's a pretty package
waiting inside for you.

469
00:22:51,993 --> 00:22:54,561
- You just gonna keep ignoring my calls?
- I wasn't ignoring them.

470
00:22:54,681 --> 00:22:57,541
- I saw you through the window.
- Well, my phone is broken.

471
00:22:58,609 --> 00:22:59,931
What are you doing here?

472
00:23:00,051 --> 00:23:01,965
Well, since you wouldn't
answer the phone,

473
00:23:02,085 --> 00:23:04,041
I flew in to apologize personally.

474
00:23:05,646 --> 00:23:06,923
I appreciate that.

475
00:23:07,507 --> 00:23:09,040
I said some things--

476
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,686
I was really feeling awful about myself
and I took it out on you.

477
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,443
Do you accept my apology?

478
00:23:15,563 --> 00:23:16,815
Yeah, I do.

479
00:23:17,502 --> 00:23:19,908
Any chance you might
be my manager again?

480
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:22,086
I don't know about that, Vince.

481
00:23:22,206 --> 00:23:24,963
I think maybe some
of the things you said were right.

482
00:23:25,456 --> 00:23:28,693
I did fuck some things up and I guess
I got in Ari's way a little bit.

483
00:23:28,977 --> 00:23:30,456
I'm okay with that now.

484
00:23:30,697 --> 00:23:32,963
I got some things going on
and you will too.

485
00:23:33,353 --> 00:23:34,977
I got something going on:

486
00:23:36,868 --> 00:23:38,795
the lead in Scorsese's next movie.

487
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,631
What?
How?

488
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,508
Good management.
You in?

489
00:23:45,253 --> 00:23:47,929
Come on, I don't want to do
this without my brother.

490
00:23:49,572 --> 00:23:51,683
Yeah, I'm in.
Scorsese?

491
00:23:51,843 --> 00:23:53,685
That's crazy.
Congratulations.

492
00:23:53,845 --> 00:23:56,670
Thank god. That scene
was getting way to gay for my tastes.

493
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,589
We missed you, E.

494
00:24:00,456 --> 00:24:01,689
How are you, man?

495
00:24:05,184 --> 00:24:06,740
Let's go get wasted.

496
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,488
- Let's do it.
- I like it.

497
00:24:08,608 --> 00:24:09,993
Where to, where to?

498
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:17,536
You guys ready for what's coming?
It's gonna be big.

499
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,154
I've been ready for a long time.

500
00:24:19,274 --> 00:24:21,403
But don't worry.
I won't let it go to my head.

501
00:24:21,523 --> 00:24:24,489
I just put you in a Scorsese movie.
I might let it go to mine.

502
