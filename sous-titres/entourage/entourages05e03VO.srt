3
00:01:16,948 --> 00:01:18,127
I can't believe this.

4
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,969
He finally hooks up with Justine
Chapin and he won't tell us nothing.

5
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:23,053
I told you, Turtle,
we had a good time.

6
00:01:23,213 --> 00:01:25,434
Come on, Vin.
Need little more info than that.

7
00:01:25,594 --> 00:01:27,960
Besides, since when don't we share
the details of our love life?

8
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,468
Since you shared the details
of the girl with the anal warts.

9
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:32,810
That was therapy,
not entertainment.

10
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,969
Just give the little perv
something, bro.

11
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:37,096
He won't stop nagging
till he gets what he wants.

12
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:40,311
- Like you don't want to know?
- I have my own sex life to jerk off to.

13
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:42,731
Uh, correction--
you had your own sex life.

14
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,296
I mean, it was virtual,
but now it's over. What?

15
00:01:45,456 --> 00:01:47,937
No, it's okay, bro.
He's right. It's over.

16
00:01:48,713 --> 00:01:50,555
Jacqueline was just another hozy

17
00:01:50,715 --> 00:01:53,538
who tore my heart out of my chest
and handed it to me.

18
00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:55,227
So laugh at me.
Whatever.

19
00:01:55,387 --> 00:01:57,863
I'm not laughing.
I'm just curious what a "hozy" is.

20
00:01:58,023 --> 00:02:01,875
It's a ho and a floozy.
And as it turns out, she was both.

21
00:02:02,127 --> 00:02:03,835
We'll get you through it, Johnny.

22
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:05,442
Let's cross here.

23
00:02:08,354 --> 00:02:09,764
We got it, come on.

24
00:02:11,351 --> 00:02:13,624
Keep your eyes
closed, daddy!

25
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:15,344
They're closed, buddy.

26
00:02:15,504 --> 00:02:16,890
- He's peeking.
- I'm not.

27
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,351
Why do women never trust me, honey?
Come on.

28
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:21,684
Okay, we're almost there.
Just a couple more steps.

29
00:02:21,844 --> 00:02:23,496
- All right.
- A couple more.

30
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:24,746
All right.

31
00:02:24,906 --> 00:02:26,691
All right, stop now.
Open your eyes.

32
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:29,437
Fuck me!

33
00:02:29,597 --> 00:02:31,480
- Daddy!
- I'm sorry, buddy, I'm sorry.

34
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,031
But holy sh--

35
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,645
Baby, what is this?

36
00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:37,213
Happy... Anniversary.

37
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:40,420
I don't-- baby,
my gift does not compare to that.

38
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,672
Don't worry. I got myself
something to make up for it.

39
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:45,543
Oh my God, remember how much
I wanted this when I was 25?

40
00:02:45,925 --> 00:02:48,079
- Now you have it.
- But I'm not 25.

41
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,881
Well, maybe it'll make you
feel like you are.

42
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,112
- Can I drive?
- Never.

43
00:02:56,506 --> 00:02:57,599
- Oh man!

44
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:00,568
I know things are bad, Marvin.

45
00:03:00,728 --> 00:03:04,103
Bad was last year.
Things are fucking disastrous now.

46
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:06,247
You're like Katrina
with a black card.

47
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:09,359
- I've been broke before.
- You're not broke-- you're bankrupt.

48
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,069
You've got to file chapter 11.

49
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:12,697
I'm not filing chapter 11.

50
00:03:12,857 --> 00:03:15,941
You've got to wipe the slate
clean and start all over again.

51
00:03:16,101 --> 00:03:18,868
And this time on a budget
and without dependents.

52
00:03:19,137 --> 00:03:21,913
- Should I just get an appetizer?
- You should go on a hunger strike.

53
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,696
Vince, this is no time to be proud.

54
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:27,331
My father filed bankruptcy,

55
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:29,563
left my mother with nothing--
Not even child support.

56
00:03:29,723 --> 00:03:31,850
Call it pride, whatever you want,
I'm not doing it.

57
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,126
You're a better man than me, bro.
I filed three times.

58
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,845
Maybe that's why I'm alone.

59
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:38,680
Maybe it's because you're fucking ugly.

60
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:41,433
All right, Vince, don't file.

61
00:03:41,593 --> 00:03:42,938
But get a job, and fast.

62
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:46,104
- There's nothing to grab that quick.
- Oh no? Call shauna.

63
00:03:46,264 --> 00:03:50,191
She's just got a client we share
an appearance deal in Dubai.

64
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:52,055
They pay big money
for girls over there.

65
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:55,739
It was Michael Buble, moron.
And all he had to do

66
00:03:56,074 --> 00:03:57,949
was show up at a camel race.

67
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:00,589
A camel race?
Doesn't sound too bad, huh?

68
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,080
Nice car, Ari.

69
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,833
Anniversary gift from the wife.
Thanks, Davies.

70
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:22,400
That's right, I forgot--
You married into money.

71
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,073
Good for you, Ari.
Good for you.

72
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:26,199
We only use her money
for the small stuff.

73
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:28,939
Someday when you're done
sucking on Terrance's tit,

74
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:31,399
you might want to get yourself
into a man's car like this.

75
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:34,277
Breathe deep, Ari...

76
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:37,434
Here comes the dust.

77
00:04:40,352 --> 00:04:41,278
Fuck it.

78
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:01,170
Easy, Ari.

79
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:04,140
What do you say we race for pink slips?

80
00:05:04,773 --> 00:05:07,977
I was thinking about getting that car
for my daughter for her sweet 16.

81
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:11,648
Your daughter's almost 16, Ari?
Two more years and she's legal.

82
00:05:12,049 --> 00:05:13,838
- Watch it, davies.
- Or what?

83
00:05:14,103 --> 00:05:16,385
You couldn't catch me
if you wanted to.

84
00:05:16,545 --> 00:05:18,697
100 bucks says I pass Bijan before you.

85
00:05:18,857 --> 00:05:20,448
Bijan?
You really are a bitch.

86
00:05:20,847 --> 00:05:22,075
But you're on!

87
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:08,313
Christy, where
the fuck are you?

88
00:06:08,473 --> 00:06:10,999
You said you were going to speak
nicer to me in front of the clients.

89
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:13,184
File a labor grievance.
In the meantime,

90
00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:15,712
do we have any appearances
that Vincent can do?

91
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,923
Actually I just got a call from a guy in
Bel Air about his daughter's sweet 16.

92
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:21,846
Zac Efron was supposed to do it,
but his appendix exploded.

93
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,804
Call him back
and tell him we have an actor

94
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:25,575
whose testicles have actually dropped.

95
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:27,324
But tell him that Vince won't do it

96
00:06:27,484 --> 00:06:29,308
for a dime less than
Zachary was getting.

97
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:31,468
Maybe we should have Shauna
call the studios.

98
00:06:31,628 --> 00:06:33,730
- Yeah, if she can close.
- Oh, I'll close.

99
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,854
These people would be lucky
to have you, Vincent.

100
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:37,328
Let's make it a two-fer.

101
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:39,902
This way the Chase brothers
can wipe them out clean.

102
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:42,005
Stick to chili festivals, Drama.

103
00:06:42,495 --> 00:06:43,924
What the fuck does that mean?

104
00:06:44,084 --> 00:06:46,284
It means that you're far
from a sweet 16's wet dream.

105
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:53,758
I'll be outside, fellas.

106
00:06:54,028 --> 00:06:55,481
What's he so sensitive about?

107
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:58,421
- He's going through a rough breakup.
- Someone went out with him?

108
00:07:01,405 --> 00:07:02,717
- <i>It's Amanda.</i>
- Hey.

109
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:04,854
- This a good time?
- <i>Yeah, what's up?</i>

110
00:07:05,014 --> 00:07:06,660
I am impressed with your taste.

111
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,265
That's a very good script you gave me.

112
00:07:09,425 --> 00:07:11,653
- Yeah, I thought so.
- I sent it to Edward Norton

113
00:07:11,813 --> 00:07:13,936
'cause I have a feeling
he may just respond to it.

114
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:16,397
- Ed Norton?
- Yes, I hope that was okay.

115
00:07:16,557 --> 00:07:17,690
- Of course.
- Great.

116
00:07:17,877 --> 00:07:20,084
I'll let you know when I hear something.
Say hi to Vince.

117
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:21,611
<i>All right, thanks, Amanda.</i>

118
00:07:23,561 --> 00:07:25,013
- Amanda says hi.
- Oh yeah?

119
00:07:25,173 --> 00:07:27,223
- She liked <i>Nine Brave Souls</i>.
- Really?

120
00:07:27,383 --> 00:07:29,494
She wants to give it to Ed Norton.

121
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,041
They're excited about Vince, but they'd
like to meet him before they commit.

122
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:38,349
- I can't even book a sweet 16?
- Oh, it's just a formality.

123
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:40,130
Go there,
be your charming self,

124
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,500
but leave Turtle and Drama
in the car, okay?

125
00:07:43,626 --> 00:07:45,134
I was worried about you, Ari.

126
00:07:45,294 --> 00:07:47,471
You're never late
and you always answer your cell.

127
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:50,282
Yeah, well, I had a little
problem with the Ferrari.

128
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:51,692
- Already?
- Yep.

129
00:07:51,852 --> 00:07:54,719
I was involved in some
illegal street-racing.

130
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,956
- Oooh, sexy.
- With Adam Davies.

131
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,959
- Gross.
- And I lost so I owe him 100 bucks.

132
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,915
Oh, fuck Adam Davies.

133
00:08:03,075 --> 00:08:05,189
I'd like to see him come here
and try and collect.

134
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:08,491
Well, my confidence grows tenfold
knowing that you have my back, Lloyd.

135
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:11,296
But I don't welch.
So here is $100.

136
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:14,956
Please put it in a brown paper bag
along with a nice big pile of shit

137
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:17,099
and send it over there.

138
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:19,330
- Excuse me--
- Human shit, Lloyd.

139
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,337
- Right now.
- That is really disgusting.

140
00:08:21,497 --> 00:08:24,801
No, really disgusting is going to be
the <i>American Psycho</i> style dismemberment

141
00:08:24,961 --> 00:08:28,485
I am going to perform on you
if you don't do that right fucking now.

142
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:33,558
- What about doggy poo?
- Human shit, Lloyd!

143
00:08:33,718 --> 00:08:37,254
Yours, if it's easier. Otherwise,
go camp out in the men's bathroom

144
00:08:37,414 --> 00:08:41,140
or the women's bathroom, whichever
will have you, but I need a specimen.

145
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:46,279
- What?
- <i>That's a nice greeting</i>

146
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:48,473
the Miller Gold agency's
got going on there.

147
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:51,332
Listen, if I knew it was you,
it would have been a lot worse. What?

148
00:08:51,492 --> 00:08:53,390
I want you to know that we're on our way

149
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,887
to try to land Vince
a sweet 16 appearance gig.

150
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:57,704
Jesus!

151
00:08:58,502 --> 00:09:01,169
Meanwhile the script I sent you
last week is on its way to Ed Norton.

152
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:03,045
- Really?
- Yeah, <i>Nine Brave Souls</i>.

153
00:09:03,205 --> 00:09:05,965
- Amanda liked it.
- We all know what great taste she has.

154
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,885
- Vince needs a job, Ari.
- I understand that, Eric.

155
00:09:10,421 --> 00:09:12,242
But you need to understand

156
00:09:12,402 --> 00:09:14,223
<i>that you are the reason
he doesn't have one.</i>

157
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:17,954
Vince needs a studio movie.
Not an indie.

158
00:09:18,114 --> 00:09:20,505
<i>So don't waste my fucking
time with the possibility</i>

159
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:23,408
that maybe Ed Norton might read
or may not read some fucking script

160
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:26,236
that may or may not be good
because some half-ass agent

161
00:09:26,396 --> 00:09:29,697
who couldn't carry
my sperm sample likes it.

162
00:09:30,175 --> 00:09:31,859
- <i>Okay?</i>
- Yeah, okay.

163
00:09:32,735 --> 00:09:34,827
- Does he have anything?
- Yeah, he's got a few leads.

164
00:09:35,263 --> 00:09:36,888
What was he yelling about?

165
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,946
Ah, you know Ari.
He's just stressed.

166
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:40,601
Everybody seems to be today.

167
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:42,585
The moon must be in retrograde.

168
00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:56,274
- <i>Yes?</i>
- How are you doing?

169
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:58,276
I have Vincent Chase
for the sweet 16 meet.

170
00:09:58,436 --> 00:10:01,938
Come through. And please
take your shoes off at the front door.

171
00:10:09,645 --> 00:10:11,239
I'm not taking off my fucking shoes.

172
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:13,980
What's the problem, Drama?
You make people do it at your place.

173
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,106
I just broke up with someone.
I'm exhausted.

174
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:18,454
Mr. Levine is waiting for you.
This way, please.

175
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,873
<i>You're about to die with blood on.</i>

176
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,181
<i>Let's get him!</i>

177
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:25,636
Mr. Bob,
your 2:00 is here.

178
00:10:25,796 --> 00:10:27,755
Oh, welcome.
Please come in.

179
00:10:28,603 --> 00:10:31,168
Oh, guys, I'm so happy you're here.
Bob Levine. How are you?

180
00:10:31,544 --> 00:10:32,652
Nice to meet you.

181
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:34,836
- Please, of course.
- How are you, Bob?

182
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:38,349
Nice to see you. Mitchell, say hello
to Mr. Chase and his friends.

183
00:10:38,857 --> 00:10:41,089
- Hey.
- I'm so happy you're here in my home.

184
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:42,794
I'm such a fan.
Now,

185
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:44,814
who wants some Johnny blue?

186
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:46,431
- Johnny does.
- I'm driving.

187
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:47,926
- Why not?
- I'm working.

188
00:10:48,086 --> 00:10:49,875
- All right.
- In fact, make mine a double.

189
00:10:50,035 --> 00:10:52,597
- Coming up.
- Hello, everybody, hello.

190
00:10:53,007 --> 00:10:55,741
- I thought we said 2:00?
- We came right from Shauna's office.

191
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:58,870
All right, it's 2:30
and I am extremely pressed for time.

192
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,163
That Zac Efron
really fucked me over.

193
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:04,859
But my son tells me my daughter's going
to be absolutely thrilled with you.

194
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:06,038
Right, Mitchy?

195
00:11:07,996 --> 00:11:11,632
What are you doing with your shoes on?
Please take your shoes off.

196
00:11:13,645 --> 00:11:15,426
Take your shoes off, Drama.

197
00:11:18,835 --> 00:11:21,404
Now I don't know
what my husband told you,

198
00:11:21,564 --> 00:11:24,520
but tonight is extremely
important to both of us.

199
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,097
Ah yes, we're spending
just over a million

200
00:11:27,257 --> 00:11:28,718
on our sweet baby girl.

201
00:11:28,878 --> 00:11:30,276
That's some sweet 16.

202
00:11:30,595 --> 00:11:32,358
You don't know the half of it.

203
00:11:32,518 --> 00:11:35,028
We're gonna be swimming
in an ocean of cristal.

204
00:11:35,188 --> 00:11:37,033
I've got enough
Almas Russian-Gold caviar

205
00:11:37,193 --> 00:11:40,619
for 300 guests, so, please,
don't come on an empty stomach!

206
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:44,206
Okay, so Efron was supposed
to do a performance. What can you do?

207
00:11:45,314 --> 00:11:46,709
Uh, I act.

208
00:11:47,136 --> 00:11:48,651
What else can you do?

209
00:11:49,487 --> 00:11:51,361
Vince would love to make an appearance,

210
00:11:51,521 --> 00:11:54,292
greet guests, have a dance with your
daughter. How does that sound?

211
00:11:54,452 --> 00:11:55,535
- Nice.
- Boring.

212
00:11:55,695 --> 00:11:58,263
- She doesn't do boring.
- No, I need flashy.

213
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:00,843
She needs someone
to take that stick out of her ass.

214
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:02,011
Excuse me?

215
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:04,122
Vince was aquaman, ma'am,

216
00:12:04,282 --> 00:12:06,228
star of the highest
grossing film of all time.

217
00:12:09,681 --> 00:12:10,983
Yes, okay...

218
00:12:11,386 --> 00:12:14,236
And what is aquaman known
for again, Mitchell?

219
00:12:14,753 --> 00:12:17,823
He's king of the ocean. He can dehydrate
his opponent with a single touch.

220
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:19,910
- Right.
- Sweetheart, what if--

221
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,563
Okay, here's what I'm thinking.

222
00:12:21,723 --> 00:12:24,791
We will have Vince
dressed as aquaman,

223
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,459
unveil him at the party
sitting in an ice throne

224
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:30,753
- in the middle of the pool.
- Are you serious?

225
00:12:30,913 --> 00:12:33,506
All of the tables surround
the hotel pool

226
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,667
and you will be like
a living centerpiece

227
00:12:35,827 --> 00:12:37,627
for everyone to see.
I love this.

228
00:12:37,787 --> 00:12:40,038
Five hours on an iceberg
could get a bit chilly, huh?

229
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:42,564
- Sweetie?
- 200 gs warm you up, Vince?

230
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:45,070
Fuck that. I'd rather be bankrupt.

231
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,160
You know how you drive
in <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>?

232
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,406
Way ahead of you.

233
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:50,700
- What a waste of time.
- Not a total waste.

234
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:54,490
- Oh, you boosted their scotch, Johnny?
- Fuck 'em.

235
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,022
The way they insulted you, bro,
they had it coming.

236
00:12:57,182 --> 00:12:59,348
Let's get hammered
like it's St. Paddy's day.

237
00:12:59,508 --> 00:13:00,717
I know a place.

238
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,039
Look at this shit, man.
Gangster,

239
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,207
drug dealer,

240
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:09,318
rapper.

241
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:11,675
I may as well
be playing my fucking self.

242
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:13,373
What, do you want to play <i>Othello</i>?

243
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:15,464
No, I want to do <i>Black Sabbath</i>.

244
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,315
- The Ozzy Osbourne story?
- It's actually a story

245
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:20,174
about a young black supermarket checker

246
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:22,315
who falls in love
with an older jewish woman.

247
00:13:22,475 --> 00:13:24,723
- And I'm thinking Meryl Streep.
- We love Meryl Streep.

248
00:13:25,268 --> 00:13:26,742
Meryl streep is good.

249
00:13:27,312 --> 00:13:28,978
It's set against the crown heights ris.

250
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,147
- Any love scenes?
- Three.

251
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,608
- I mean, I could pull it off.
- Mr. Gold?

252
00:13:33,768 --> 00:13:34,517
Yes.

253
00:13:34,677 --> 00:13:36,527
I'm officer Nickerson.
This is officer Morgan.

254
00:13:36,687 --> 00:13:38,889
- Officer?
- Is this about the car accident?

255
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:42,601
No, sir, this is about that bag of feces
you sent one adam davies today.

256
00:13:43,628 --> 00:13:44,569
What about it?

257
00:13:44,729 --> 00:13:46,559
That sounds like an admission
of guilt to me.

258
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:48,240
- Cuff him.
- Hold on a second.

259
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,861
Wait a minute!
Hold on a second.

260
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:51,977
Since when is sending
someone a present a crime?

261
00:13:52,137 --> 00:13:53,567
Since we say it is, Mr. Gold.

262
00:13:53,727 --> 00:13:55,630
You are literally
on some sick shit, Ari.

263
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,506
Mr. Gold, if you cooperate,

264
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,220
we'll make this as pleasant
an experience as we can for you.

265
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:03,812
Wait a minute, wait!
What is this?

266
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:05,205
Who are you guys?

267
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:07,808
B.H.P.D.-- Boner patrol.

268
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:09,811
Oh, please--
Oh come on!

269
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:12,172
You're about to get
your stiffy inspected.

270
00:14:12,757 --> 00:14:13,606
Oh my God!

271
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,193
- I'm outta here.
- Hold on, T.I.

272
00:14:19,353 --> 00:14:21,339
Call me when you're done
with your entertainment.

273
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:23,808
Lloyd, you speak their language!
Make him stop!

274
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:25,477
It'll be over soon, Ari.

275
00:14:25,637 --> 00:14:27,912
Just close your eyes
and think of pussy.

276
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:36,323
I hope you're not calling me
for a release on your hard on.

277
00:14:36,483 --> 00:14:38,551
I'd call your mother for that, Davies.

278
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,666
I actually want to talk to you
about a little misunderstanding.

279
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:44,162
See, practical jokes are for friends.

280
00:14:44,322 --> 00:14:45,596
And we ain't friends.

281
00:14:45,756 --> 00:14:47,598
It wasn't a joke,
it was torture.

282
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:50,321
Get used to it, pal,
'cause it's gonna keep coming.

283
00:14:50,481 --> 00:14:52,603
Like the Terminator,
I cannot be stopped.

284
00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:55,564
This is a very dangerous game
you're playing, Davies.

285
00:14:56,651 --> 00:14:58,977
I am going to fuck with you
day and night.

286
00:14:59,137 --> 00:15:01,234
You know why?
Because I'm younger,

287
00:15:01,394 --> 00:15:03,487
cooler
and better looking than you.

288
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:05,658
And because I can.

289
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:08,812
This means war.

290
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:11,749
I thought it was war
when I sent him shit this morning.

291
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:14,998
Look, I'm about to tell you something
that stays with us, all right?

292
00:15:15,158 --> 00:15:17,648
And is not to be shared
with Mrs. Ari.

293
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:20,393
Now I know you don't know the man code,
so I want you to swear

294
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:23,803
on Tom getting gangrene on his cock
that you will say nothing.

295
00:15:23,963 --> 00:15:26,164
- I won't utter a word.
- All right.

296
00:15:27,256 --> 00:15:29,514
Davies' girlfriend back
in the day made a play for me

297
00:15:29,674 --> 00:15:31,869
when she was humping
a pushcart in the mailroom.

298
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:34,144
I didn't do anything,
but I saved the evidence.

299
00:15:34,776 --> 00:15:37,606
Slut!
What are you going to do with these?

300
00:15:37,766 --> 00:15:41,210
I am going to send these to Davies
and I'm going to shatter his world

301
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,916
because a shattered world is what
you get when you mess with Ari Gold.

302
00:15:45,076 --> 00:15:48,932
Well, if you ask me, Ari Gold
should rise up and be the bigger man.

303
00:15:49,092 --> 00:15:51,132
Well, unlike your world
where the bigger man

304
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:52,955
pounds the smaller man from behind,

305
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:56,357
the bigger man in my world
is the last man standing.

306
00:15:56,517 --> 00:15:59,962
And that man will be me, all right?
So I want you to send those pictures

307
00:16:00,374 --> 00:16:02,690
and let's watch the atom bomb explode.

308
00:16:05,861 --> 00:16:09,398
Hos, hos and more hos. I can't believe
you guys dragged me here.

309
00:16:09,558 --> 00:16:12,971
- You used to love crazy girls.
- I used to love a lot of things, bro.

310
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:15,011
But a lot of things
just didn't love me back.

311
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:16,013
Hey, guys.

312
00:16:16,173 --> 00:16:17,938
Save it, honey.
We're anti-women here.

313
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,091
Real smooth, Drama, nice.

314
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:24,799
- Marvin.
- Voicemail.

315
00:16:25,891 --> 00:16:27,933
Maybe we should just
Ebay-off everything we own.

316
00:16:28,093 --> 00:16:29,899
We don't own that much.
Most of it's leased.

317
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:32,446
Auction that shit off anyway.
It'll be somebody else's problem.

318
00:16:32,606 --> 00:16:34,236
- Great idea.
- We're not gonna panic.

319
00:16:34,396 --> 00:16:37,521
It's gonna work out someway somehow.
What is it you always say, Vince?

320
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:39,592
It'll work out.
It always does, right?

321
00:16:39,752 --> 00:16:41,112
- I used to say that?
- Yeah.

322
00:16:41,272 --> 00:16:42,838
Hear hear!
Life sucks.

323
00:16:45,063 --> 00:16:46,008
Hey, Shauna.

324
00:16:46,168 --> 00:16:49,386
It ain't shauna, Eric. It's Marvin.
Stop ducking my fucking phone calls.

325
00:16:49,546 --> 00:16:51,263
It's Shauna too.
You're on conference.

326
00:16:51,423 --> 00:16:53,182
- What's going on?
- What's going on is

327
00:16:53,342 --> 00:16:55,768
your client ducked out
on a $200,000 appearance fee.

328
00:16:55,928 --> 00:16:57,038
I know. I was there.

329
00:16:57,198 --> 00:16:59,303
Didn't I stress the importance
of income this morning?

330
00:16:59,463 --> 00:17:01,092
You did, but it wasn't the right offer.

331
00:17:01,252 --> 00:17:03,942
<i>We know all about it.
I spoke to Levine personally.</i>

332
00:17:04,102 --> 00:17:06,779
He'll pay Vincent 200 grand
just to serenade the birthday girl

333
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:08,640
with that bullshit
<i>I Love You, Baby</i> song

334
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,200
from Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.
Can Vincent handle that?

335
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,584
That's why I'm on the phone,
to say he fucking better.

336
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:14,772
You got 200 grand.

337
00:17:14,932 --> 00:17:17,483
All you gotta do is sing <i>I Can't
Take My Eyes Off of You</i> to the kid.

338
00:17:17,643 --> 00:17:18,674
No iceberg?

339
00:17:19,422 --> 00:17:21,211
- He's in.
- Great, I'll notify the Levines.

340
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:23,504
I'll see you here tomorrow
morning with the check.

341
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:25,433
I'll talk to you guys later.

342
00:17:26,347 --> 00:17:28,393
- We're back in business.
- It's about time!

343
00:17:28,553 --> 00:17:30,886
What do you say we spend some
of that cash on some dancing?

344
00:17:31,046 --> 00:17:32,781
I thought you'd never ask.

345
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:34,452
Traitorous scum.

346
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,852
It's coming, Lloyd.
It's coming.

347
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,521
When, Ari, when?

348
00:17:41,482 --> 00:17:43,755
- Now, Lloyd.
- Ari Gold's office.

349
00:17:44,548 --> 00:17:46,645
Just one moment, Mr. Davies.

350
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,372
Can you smell it, Lloyd?
You know what that smells like?

351
00:17:49,532 --> 00:17:51,573
Defeat.
Surrender is imminent.

352
00:17:52,056 --> 00:17:53,818
- I feel bad for him now.
- Fuck him!

353
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,992
Like the great philosopher
Sun Tzu said,

354
00:17:56,152 --> 00:17:59,206
"When you're done fucking your enemies,
fuck them some more."

355
00:17:59,366 --> 00:18:01,593
I took philosophy
and Sun Tzu did not say that.

356
00:18:01,753 --> 00:18:03,627
I'm paraphrasing, whatever.
Put him through.

357
00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:09,073
Bravo, Ari, bravo.

358
00:18:09,636 --> 00:18:12,052
Only I broke up with that whore
six months ago.

359
00:18:13,544 --> 00:18:15,907
- Bullshit you did.
- True shit, Ari.

360
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:18,016
I'm fucking a miami heat
cheerleader now.

361
00:18:18,606 --> 00:18:20,712
<i>If you don't believe me,
watch the game tomorrow night.</i>

362
00:18:20,872 --> 00:18:22,954
I'll have her blow me courtside
for the cameras.

363
00:18:23,114 --> 00:18:25,615
Yeah, but it's still gotta
sting knowing the entire time

364
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:29,600
you were fucking your ex, she was
dreaming of getting stuffed by me.

365
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,073
<i>Please, Ari, you were hardly the only
guy around here she offered to fuck.</i>

366
00:18:33,351 --> 00:18:36,416
Word is she took on the whole new-media
division at the la quinta retreat.

367
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:37,515
<i>Whatever.</i>

368
00:18:37,675 --> 00:18:38,954
Either way, we're done!

369
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:40,909
Done?

370
00:18:43,273 --> 00:18:44,557
Not quite, pal.

371
00:18:45,581 --> 00:18:46,837
Check your email.

372
00:18:47,207 --> 00:18:49,312
<i>I, uh,
think you're gonna like it.</i>

373
00:18:51,016 --> 00:18:52,926
<i>I found it on the world wide web.</i>

374
00:18:54,806 --> 00:18:55,753
The missus!

375
00:18:55,913 --> 00:18:59,207
<i>It's from a little-known piece
of cinema called "hardbodies 3."</i>

376
00:19:00,749 --> 00:19:02,349
Did you book that job for her?

377
00:19:03,081 --> 00:19:04,655
Breathe, Ari, breathe.

378
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,361
Ari Gld!
Wait for backup!

379
00:19:16,995 --> 00:19:19,217
Please, Ari,
let me at least call your therapist.

380
00:19:19,377 --> 00:19:21,406
Adam Dvies,
I'm looking for you!

381
00:19:23,505 --> 00:19:24,621
I'm back!

382
00:19:26,254 --> 00:19:29,171
Davies,
where are you?

383
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,898
This is your unlucky day.

384
00:19:39,911 --> 00:19:42,059
Bring your bitch-ass out here.

385
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,545
Are you serious
coming here like this, Ari?

386
00:19:51,728 --> 00:19:55,050
Games are game, davies,
but that is the mother of my children.

387
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:58,033
So apologize
or I will kick your ass

388
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,804
in front of your entire
deadbeat agency.

389
00:20:04,376 --> 00:20:07,908
That is what we call a "bitch slap."
A bitch slap for a bitch.

390
00:20:08,068 --> 00:20:10,415
What do you say we go outside
and finish it off, huh?

391
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:13,694
- You are going down for this, Ari.
- I don't really care.

392
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:16,051
Now you apologize for what you did

393
00:20:16,211 --> 00:20:19,041
or I'm going to knock you the fuck out

394
00:20:19,863 --> 00:20:21,632
right here and right now.

395
00:20:25,189 --> 00:20:26,562
I'm gonna count to three.

396
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:28,510
One...

397
00:20:29,882 --> 00:20:31,419
- I apologize.
- I can't hear you.

398
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:32,556
I said--

399
00:20:34,954 --> 00:20:35,901
I'm sorry.

400
00:20:41,176 --> 00:20:42,936
Nice seeing everybody again.

401
00:20:44,555 --> 00:20:45,777
Come on, Lloyd.

402
00:20:46,894 --> 00:20:48,936
Ari Gold, you have fists of fury!

403
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:10,529
Bartender, another.

404
00:21:11,075 --> 00:21:13,559
Jesus, Drama, don't you think
you've had enough for one day?

405
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:15,117
What, are you my sponsor?

406
00:21:15,277 --> 00:21:17,932
He's right. You're like
Nick Cage in <i>Leaving Las Vegas</i>,

407
00:21:18,092 --> 00:21:20,289
except you don't have
Elisabeth Shue to fuck.

408
00:21:20,449 --> 00:21:22,795
Elisabeth Shue played a whore.

409
00:21:22,955 --> 00:21:26,438
Need I say more? Hurry up, bartender.
I've got pain to numb.

410
00:21:28,074 --> 00:21:30,292
You know what, Johnny?
I'll do another one with you.

411
00:21:30,452 --> 00:21:32,595
- Make it two.
- There you go again, bro.

412
00:21:32,953 --> 00:21:35,620
Proving my theory
that the only men in this gang

413
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,966
with hair on their balls
are the Chase men.

414
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:39,959
You all right?

415
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,803
Yeah, you know, it's not exactly
how I imagined my life to go.

416
00:21:43,963 --> 00:21:45,461
But things could be worse.

417
00:21:45,621 --> 00:21:47,360
Things are going up
from here, I know it.

418
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,567
How about my singing voice,
how's that gonna go?

419
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:52,550
You're gonna be great. I've heard you
sing it before at J.P.'s bar back home.

420
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,560
- Yeah, I was drunk.
- Here come the Levines.

421
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,098
- You're gonna be great. Don't worry.
- Thanks.

422
00:21:58,258 --> 00:21:59,931
Good evening, gentlemen.

423
00:22:00,091 --> 00:22:02,866
Please say hello
to our sweet sixteener Candace.

424
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:06,271
- Hello, Candace, nice to meet you.
- You too, Vincent.

425
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:08,237
Future hozy.

426
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,442
Please excuse the bandage.

427
00:22:10,602 --> 00:22:13,307
She hurt her nose
doing god-knows-what.

428
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:15,572
Right after I just paid
20k for a nose job.

429
00:22:15,732 --> 00:22:16,807
- Bob!
- Dad!

430
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:18,548
What, sweet plum?
It happened.

431
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,643
Maybe I injured it
sucking my boyfriend's dick.

432
00:22:20,803 --> 00:22:22,177
Did you ever think about that?

433
00:22:22,817 --> 00:22:24,080
Forget I said "future."

434
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,442
- Don't talk to your father that way.
- Fuck you, mom.

435
00:22:26,602 --> 00:22:29,916
I will go fuck this whole fucking
party right now if I fucking want to.

436
00:22:30,076 --> 00:22:33,523
Stop being such a Drama queen
and get your ass back here!

437
00:22:34,247 --> 00:22:36,121
- She's a sweet kid.
- Yeah!

438
00:22:37,227 --> 00:22:38,860
Teenager going through a phase.

439
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,238
That phase will last a lifetime, Bob.

440
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,365
He's kidding.

441
00:22:45,205 --> 00:22:46,721
Everybody, I'm home!

442
00:22:48,351 --> 00:22:49,537
Thank you, sweetie.

443
00:22:49,697 --> 00:22:52,382
- Why did Lloyd drop you off?
- Had a little mishap with the Ferrari.

444
00:22:52,542 --> 00:22:53,519
What?!

445
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,878
- Daddy!
- There's my man.

446
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,381
Guess what?
Your daddy got you a gift.

447
00:22:59,747 --> 00:23:02,050
- Cool!
- Cool is right. And you know what?

448
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,302
I'll show you how to use them.
You want to know why?

449
00:23:04,462 --> 00:23:06,348
Because you're
the strongest guy in hollywood?

450
00:23:06,508 --> 00:23:08,987
I told you that already?
Now it's official.

451
00:23:10,093 --> 00:23:11,133
- Honey?
- Yeah?

452
00:23:11,293 --> 00:23:13,365
What kind of mishap
did you get in with the Ferrari?

453
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,346
Remember how you said
the car would make me feel 25 again?

454
00:23:16,506 --> 00:23:18,102
- Yes.
- It made me feel...

455
00:23:18,262 --> 00:23:20,040
18 again
and I'm going to prove it to you.

456
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,156
- What about the kids?
- Sarah, take care of your brother.

457
00:23:23,316 --> 00:23:25,375
Mommy and daddy
have a little conference.

458
00:23:25,535 --> 00:23:28,410
- Are you still taking me to dinner?
- That's doubtful.

459
00:23:35,075 --> 00:23:37,429
That's not the only thing
she's going to be blowing tonight.

460
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:40,603
- Will you shut up, Drama?
- Why don't you make me, E?

461
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:42,601
Okay, everybody,

462
00:23:43,251 --> 00:23:46,511
we have a very special
surprise for you.

463
00:23:47,116 --> 00:23:49,541
Please give a warm warm welcome

464
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,769
to Mr. Vincent Chase of <i>Aquaman</i> fame!

465
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:56,261
Break a leg, bro.

466
00:23:56,934 --> 00:23:58,282
He's coming.

467
00:24:05,088 --> 00:24:07,214
Won't you please say a few words?

468
00:24:09,611 --> 00:24:13,665
I'm very happy to be here with Candace
on this very special occasion.

469
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:17,269
I know a way you could make it
more special, Vincent.

470
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:19,367
Candace, don't be a whore.

471
00:24:19,527 --> 00:24:21,797
Everybody,
Mr. Vincent Chase.

472
00:24:40,273 --> 00:24:42,427
I'm not letting him go out like this.

473
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,330
Not my bro.
Not tonight.

474
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,358
What are you talking about?
He sounds great.

475
00:24:47,518 --> 00:24:49,568
- Stop it, Drama.
- Not to my ears he don't.

476
00:24:49,728 --> 00:24:51,273
Put your jacket on!

477
00:25:09,588 --> 00:25:11,555
- Yeah?
- Good news, Eric.

478
00:25:12,026 --> 00:25:13,879
- Ed Norton liked the script?
- He loved it.

479
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,774
- He wants to do it.
- That's great.

480
00:25:15,934 --> 00:25:18,363
Only he sees it a little bit
bigger than scripted.

481
00:25:18,523 --> 00:25:21,129
He wants to see the fireman
battling the blaze

482
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:23,692
instead of just sitting around
the firehouse talking about it.

483
00:25:23,852 --> 00:25:25,896
That sounds like a lot bigger
than a little bigger.

484
00:25:26,056 --> 00:25:28,748
He wants to make it a studio film.
Maybe get Ridley Scott to direct it.

485
00:25:28,908 --> 00:25:31,281
And he thinks <i>Smoke Jumpers</i>
is a more evocative title

486
00:25:31,441 --> 00:25:33,702
than <i>Nine Brave Souls</i>.
You okay with that?

487
00:25:34,005 --> 00:25:35,099
- Sure.
- Great.

488
00:25:35,259 --> 00:25:37,027
I'll let you know when I know more.

489
00:25:37,187 --> 00:25:38,373
Go back to your party.

490
00:25:44,994 --> 00:25:46,214
Yeah, Vincent Chase!

491
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:49,624
Oh my God.

492
00:26:05,268 --> 00:26:06,920
Can you hear me, bitches?

493
00:26:19,051 --> 00:26:21,241
I hope you got
the money in advance.
