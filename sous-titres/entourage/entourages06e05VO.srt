1
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,415
Hey, should I
sleep over tonight?

2
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:26,168
- If you want to.
- Well, do you want me to?

3
00:01:26,202 --> 00:01:28,220
I want you to
if you want to.

4
00:01:30,306 --> 00:01:32,707
Wow, this looks amazing.

5
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,543
It's my specialty.

6
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,645
I only grill for
very special people.

7
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,680
- I appreciate that.
- ( laughs )

8
00:01:38,714 --> 00:01:42,217
You know, I don't think
I'm gonna sleep over tonight.

9
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,485
That's cool.

10
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,104
I mean I slept here
every night this week.

11
00:01:45,155 --> 00:01:47,272
Look, I totally
understand.

12
00:01:47,323 --> 00:01:49,658
And it doesn't sound
like you want me to.

13
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,527
I want you to.
I mean, if you want to.

14
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:53,495
But if you don't,
that's totally cool.

15
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,947
I want to.

16
00:01:54,998 --> 00:01:57,449
- Then I want you to.
- Well, good.

17
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,451
- <i>( phone ringing )</i>
- I'll get it.

18
00:01:59,502 --> 00:02:02,554
- No, let's eat.
I'll call back.
- I got it.

19
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,792
It's Sloan.

20
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:09,578
- Huh?
- Your caller I.D.
Says it's Sloan.

21
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,463
Oh.

22
00:02:11,514 --> 00:02:14,916
- I'm assuming
there's only one Sloan.
- Yeah.

23
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:17,035
- Should you answer it?
- No.

24
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,506
- What, should I?
- No.

25
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,759
So what do you think
she wanted?

26
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,728
I have no idea.

27
00:02:26,762 --> 00:02:29,615
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

28
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,435
Please get it.

29
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,820
No.

30
00:02:34,871 --> 00:02:36,155
Don't you want to know
what she wants?

31
00:02:36,206 --> 00:02:37,372
I don't care
what she wants.

32
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,607
What if something's wrong?

33
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,325
You should answer it.
Please.

34
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:45,047
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, eric, it's Sloan.</i>

35
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,915
- Hey.
- <i>Is this a bad time?</i>

36
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:49,084
- No.
- Okay.

37
00:02:49,118 --> 00:02:52,287
I just wanted
to let you know

38
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:54,923
The golf charity thing
you guys are playing
in tomorrow,

39
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:57,309
- <i>I'm co-chairing</i>
<i> the event.</i>
- Oh.

40
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,179
- <i>I didn't know</i>
<i> if you knew that or not.</i>
- Did not.

41
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,981
Well, I wanted you to
so it's not awkward

42
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,984
- Between us
when we see each other.
- That's cool.

43
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,572
So hopefully this awkwardness
ended the awkwardness.

44
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,991
- Okay.
- <i>Okay.</i>

45
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,861
- Good talk.
- Okay.

46
00:03:15,912 --> 00:03:17,996
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye.

47
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,916
So what did she want?

48
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,168
I don't know.

49
00:03:25,154 --> 00:03:27,739
- Why did you say that?
- I don't know.

50
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,375
Should have just told
her "I'm seeing my ex
today, no big deal."

51
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,811
- Yeah.
- You've been with
this girl a month.

52
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:35,180
- She's already got
you living in fear?
- I don't know.

53
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,949
Poor E.
You're such a mess.

54
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,251
- Speaking of messes.
- Jesus.

55
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:41,286
- Vince: <i>Yo, what up, ari?</i>
- Hey.

56
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,788
Hey, you good?
Everyone good?

57
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,923
- Yeah, we're good.
Are you good?
- Yeah.

58
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,925
- You don't look good.
- In fact, you look awful.

59
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,393
Yeah, I didn't get
any sleep last night.

60
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,062
The wife made me
sleep on the couch.

61
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,397
- First time in 15 years.
- Why, what'd you do?

62
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:54,349
Well, I suppose
I lied to her.

63
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:57,152
Everybody seems
to be doing that
these days.

64
00:03:57,186 --> 00:03:58,654
I just can't
understand it.

65
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:00,589
Me and my girl,
we always tell each
other the truth

66
00:04:00,623 --> 00:04:03,225
- And we have no problems.
- Yeah, Turtle, you have
no problems.

67
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:06,295
Sorry.  So sorry I'm late.
I could not find this place.

68
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,997
Hello, all.
Sharp shirt, Johnny Drama.

69
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:11,733
- ( all laughing )
- I'll be hitting the pro shop.

70
00:04:11,768 --> 00:04:14,002
What are you doing in civilian
clothing anyway, lloyd?

71
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:16,538
- I have him caddying today.
- Very nice, ari.

72
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:19,241
I'm building his self-esteem.
Go stand in the corner.

73
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:21,743
Right there, chop chop.

74
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:25,847
Incoming, 3:00.

75
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:30,452
- Hey, guys.  Hey.
- <i>Hey.</i>

76
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:33,288
Listen, sorry if I
was a little weird on
the phone last night.

77
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:34,889
Oh, it's not a big deal.

78
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,159
I'm sorry for...
Everything.

79
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,245
You guys, thank you
so much for coming.

80
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,613
Of course.

81
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,732
I see you're enjoying
the wonderful breakfast.

82
00:04:43,766 --> 00:04:45,300
I have your pairings here.

83
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:47,369
I hope you're not bummed.
This was difficult.

84
00:04:47,403 --> 00:04:50,005
- I put vince
and Johnny together.
- Why wouldn't you?

85
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,224
With tom brady
and mark wahlberg.

86
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:55,994
Gee, who's the ugliest
person in that foursome?
Think fast.

87
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,196
Ari, jeffrey tambor
called 10 times

88
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,248
To make sure I paired you
with him and his sons.

89
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:03,151
<i>He said he</i>
<i>cleared it with you.</i>
<i>You'd be thrilled.</i>

90
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:06,905
Well, it's for charity.
So I'll see you guys
out there.

91
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,740
- Got to go shopping, vince.
- Let's do it.

92
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,108
- See you guys later.
- Bye.

93
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,511
Grab jeffrey and his kids
stuff pronto.

94
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,980
- Hey, ari.
- Hey, jeff.

95
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:18,684
Ari, come on, you tell
my boys how good my game
has gotten.

96
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,119
Are you kidding me?
His game is great.

97
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,654
That would be great.

98
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:25,874
- So what about me?
Who am I with?
- Who are <i>we</i> with?

99
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,826
Actually, somebody requested
to play with you also.

100
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,496
Really?  Is it strahan
or gretzky?  'cause I saw
them walk by earlier.

101
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:33,448
It's not, Turtle.
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:36,084
Murray berenson.

103
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:38,870
Who the fuck is that?

104
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,760
This is a celebrity
tournament and I don't get
to play with a celebrity?

105
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:47,262
- What's up with that?
- I wrote a $5000 donation
check, Turtle.

106
00:05:47,296 --> 00:05:49,097
You didn't,
so stop complaining.

107
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:51,867
Still don't make me feel
good to know I'm playing with
you and some other nobody.

108
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:53,568
Murray berenson
is far from nobody.

109
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,270
The guy practically invented
the management business.

110
00:05:55,304 --> 00:05:57,472
- Why do you think
he wants to play with you?
- Good question.

111
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,876
I tried to get berenson
to sign me like nine times
in the '90s.

112
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,544
At least we know
he has great taste.

113
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:05,580
- Yo, gatsby
and the funky bunch.
- What's up, mark?

114
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,250
- What's up, boys?
You guys know tom.
- Hey, tom, how are you?

115
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,985
- Hey, vince, how are you?
- Good.  This is E.

116
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:11,753
- Nice to meet you.
- My brother Johnny.

117
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,388
- Hey, tom, how you doing?
- Turtle.

118
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:16,007
- Turtle.
- Hey.

119
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,292
All right.

120
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:19,828
Okay.

121
00:06:19,862 --> 00:06:21,863
Shall we?

122
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:24,433
We shall.
Later, b squad.

123
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,835
- See you later.
- I'm driving.

124
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:29,388
What was that?

125
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,856
What was what?

126
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,674
You were a little
rude to brady, no?

127
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,843
Hey, unlike you guys,
I don't sleep with the enemy.

128
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,362
- Notice the head covers?
- What are you, five?

129
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,298
- I am what I am.
- Is that eric murphy?

130
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,401
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Murray berenson.

131
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:44,152
Yeah, of course.
How are you?

132
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:45,687
Just came from
my cardiologist

133
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:47,188
And all four valves
are working.

134
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,691
If he'd just marry my ex,
or if anyone would,

135
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,326
I'd be utopic.

136
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,995
- Is that a word, utopic?
- I don't know.

137
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:55,881
I'll check.
If it's not,
I'll trademark it.

138
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,966
- Cool.
- So come ride
with me, kid.

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,218
- Oh, I got my friend.
- He'll follow.  Come on.

140
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,020
Go, I'm good.

141
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,457
It's wonderful
this tournament came
when it did.

142
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:06,892
Oh, yeah?
Why's that?

143
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,594
Well, I just heard that you
closed down your little shop.

144
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,797
- Yeah, I did.
- And I wanted to
talk to you

145
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,932
About coming to work
at my big shop.

146
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:19,187
So, fellas, I'm thinking
maybe we should make this
a little interesting, huh?

147
00:07:19,222 --> 00:07:21,055
Really?
At a charity event?

148
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,941
Look, if you boys
aren't up for it...

149
00:07:22,992 --> 00:07:24,743
No, we're up for it.
But is this gonna be
like the old days

150
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,195
When you tried to pay me
back in personal training
sessions and shit?

151
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,764
I'm on a hit
series now, mark.
Green money.

152
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:31,967
- Oooh.  Vince?
- Hey, I'm easy.

153
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:34,252
- Okay, what's your handicap?
- I don't play golf much.

154
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,655
- What do you
think it is, Johnny?
- Plus 50 maybe.

155
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,824
- Is that good?
- Tom: I'm a three.

156
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,592
I guess not.

157
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,160
So what are you playing
to now, marky?

158
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,629
I'm up there,
but I'll play you
at a five all day.

159
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,798
- Wow.
- You?

160
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,166
Call me a 15.

161
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,035
Oh, Drama,
you sandbagging bitch.

162
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,870
I'm working all the time.
I don't get out there much.

163
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,605
What, mark and I
are unemployed?

164
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,874
This guy's had 12 surgeries
in six months.

165
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,642
He just got out of bed
for the first time today.

166
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,077
What, you guys
don't believe me?

167
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,046
No no no, ripley.
We believe you, okay?

168
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,948
- 15's not bad.
- It's not good.

169
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,649
You want me to play to a 10,
I'll play to a 10.

170
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:07,385
No, listen,
if you're a 15,
play to a 15.

171
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,488
Vince, we'll give you
three strokes a hole.
How's that sound?

172
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,389
- Okay.
- All right, game on.

173
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,959
- $1000 a hole.
- Whoa!  Okay.

174
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,861
- We got the tee box.
- Take it.

175
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:19,331
- What did you say
this guy does anyway?
- I have no fucking idea.

176
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:23,001
I'm on a series, tom.
The same network as
the super bowl.

177
00:08:23,052 --> 00:08:25,871
You ever hear of tivo?
Game on.

178
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,073
No mercy, vince.

179
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,682
- Motherfucker!
God damn it!
- ( laughing )

180
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,419
- Hey, take a mulligan.
- Really?

181
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,623
Drama, after that shot,
take two.

182
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,062
What are you doing?

183
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,998
Who are you to judge me,
agent scum?

184
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,533
This is for charity.

185
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,968
This is for my kids
who I'm trying to impress.

186
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,904
- Is that okay with you?
- Yeah, it's okay.

187
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,572
Oh, good.

188
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:03,408
Boy:
<i>Dad, can we get the fuck</i>
<i>out of here already?</i>

189
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,377
Hey, dad,
it's so fucking hot.

190
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:08,046
- <i>It's so fucking boring.</i>
- Hey hey hey!

191
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:09,965
This is a family day.

192
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:12,300
Now shut the fuck up
and hit the ball.

193
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:14,519
I like
the tambor family.

194
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,072
- Shut the fuck up, lloyd.
- ( phone ringing )

195
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:22,377
- Hey, honey.
- Whose car is this
in the driveway?

196
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:23,895
<i>It's yours, baby.</i>
<i>You like?</i>

197
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,398
You're feeling really
guilty, aren't you?

198
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,801
No, I'm really not.
I just want you to know
that I love you.

199
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:33,154
- You said
you did nothing wrong.
- And I maintain that position.

200
00:09:33,188 --> 00:09:35,490
And yet you buy me a maserati
when you've been telling me

201
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:37,826
Over and over again that
we're trying to cut back?

202
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,694
We are cutting back, baby.

203
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,162
Your lease is up
and I just want to see

204
00:09:41,197 --> 00:09:43,298
<i>How hot you're gonna look</i>
<i>in that sexy beast.</i>

205
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,666
Why don't you just say
you're sorry?

206
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,670
Because another man's affair
is not my business.

207
00:09:48,704 --> 00:09:50,672
And it is not my business
to tell you.

208
00:09:50,706 --> 00:09:52,774
So I can't say I'm sorry.

209
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:54,593
I thought we told
each other everything.

210
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:57,429
- <i>We do.</i>
- Except this.

211
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,398
- <i>Baby.</i>
- Sick car, mom.

212
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,916
Come on, get out.
It's not mine.

213
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,989
When did you
meet tom brady?

214
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,425
It was years ago
at a charity event.

215
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:12,560
And he couldn't
have been nicer.

216
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,546
Whatever.
I don't get the guy's
whole appeal.

217
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,115
I didn't even think he
was that good-looking and I was
standing right next to him.

218
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,167
Oh my god,
you are such a hater.

219
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,503
No, I'm such a new yorker.

220
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:23,004
And I betrayed
my new york trust

221
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,106
By not telling him exactly
what I wanted to tell him.

222
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:26,424
And what was it you
wanted to tell him?

223
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,594
- That he sucks balls.
- Ha, Turtle, he doesn't.

224
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,514
- <i>What do you know?</i>
- I'm a football fan.

225
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,149
Yeah, I thought a giants fan.

226
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:35,917
And if you really were
you'd know it's the obligation

227
00:10:35,951 --> 00:10:37,452
Of every true blood
giants fan

228
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:39,988
That if you see tom brady
you tell him he sucks balls.

229
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:43,091
Turtle, do not tell tom brady
that he sucks balls.

230
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,926
<i>Actually, jamie, you know</i>
<i>what I'm gonna do?</i>

231
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,729
Since you didn't,
I'm gonna tell him he
sucks balls twice.

232
00:10:47,763 --> 00:10:50,665
One's from me
and one's from you.

233
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,034
- <i>Turtle, don't you dare.</i>
- Love you, babe.  Bye.

234
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,687
Turtle!
Idiot.

235
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,224
Where's he going?

236
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,493
Yo, Turtle.

237
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,745
I have no idea.

238
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:05,947
Anyway, where was I?

239
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:10,118
You were saying that you
started out just like me.

240
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,887
Right, all I had was
one big client.

241
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,090
George lazenby.
He was bond.

242
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:16,341
The baddest bond.

243
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:18,560
He told cubby broccoli
to go fuck himself

244
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,762
One day and he was
bond no more.

245
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:24,499
Anyway, there were two of us,
one room and a telefax.

246
00:11:24,533 --> 00:11:27,202
- How did you turn it around?
- With my charm, kid.

247
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:29,604
Convinced a big firm
to bring me in.

248
00:11:29,638 --> 00:11:31,573
Four years later
I was running the place.

249
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,808
Have you ever
considered

250
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:35,543
Making a move
to a bigger company?

251
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:37,128
Not really.
I mean, the truth is

252
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,863
I've been kind of running
outside the system.

253
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:41,182
I've been doing pretty good.
I just don't really
know anybody.

254
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:43,451
You know me now.
That's all you
need to know.

255
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:45,186
They've written
books about me.

256
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:47,789
Well, I've written
books about me, but
they've read them.

257
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:50,658
- I've read them too.
- That's good.

258
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,293
Ah, now this is good.

259
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:54,162
Hope so.
Six cubans drowned

260
00:11:54,196 --> 00:11:56,381
Off the florida keys
to get me those.

261
00:11:56,432 --> 00:11:58,767
So what is it that
I can do for you?

262
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,736
I was thinking maybe
we could do some good
for each other.

263
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:04,089
Oh, I'm guessing ari
told you about me.

264
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,057
I'm actually
kind of surprised
he said nice things.

265
00:12:06,108 --> 00:12:07,559
He and I don't usually
see eye to eye.

266
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:09,477
Ari gold?

267
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:12,247
The kid with the jew fro
who used to deliver my mail?

268
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:14,232
No, he didn't
tell me about you.

269
00:12:14,283 --> 00:12:15,617
Then who did?

270
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,986
My goddaughter Sloan.

271
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,258
( laughing )

272
00:12:25,294 --> 00:12:26,961
Oh!

273
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:31,082
- The kids see that?
- Uh, I don't think so.

274
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,734
All right,
that didn't happen.

275
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:34,368
So what is she
so pissed about?

276
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,503
I don't--
you know women.

277
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:37,872
The women I know
know the man code.

278
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,809
It's no women's business
to break that code.

279
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,077
That's what
I told her.

280
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,515
- Oh!
- Ahem.

281
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:51,119
- Did they see that?
- Uh, no.

282
00:12:51,153 --> 00:12:54,105
All right, you know,
this is a little deep
for me here.

283
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:57,292
Can we just--
let's walk up a touch.

284
00:12:57,326 --> 00:12:58,777
Okay.

285
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:01,896
Just, you know, tell
your wife to ask any man.

286
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,397
They'll all tell her
the same thing.

287
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:05,166
I should probably
have her call you.

288
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,619
- You know, maybe you should.
- Maybe, huh?

289
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,370
- Maybe I should call her.
- Maybe.

290
00:13:09,404 --> 00:13:11,339
Well, give me your phone,
I'll call her.

291
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,491
You know what?
You just focus.

292
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,494
I'm always focused
when I'm out here.

293
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,163
What am I laying
here anyway?

294
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:21,115
- Uh, not sure.
- Three?  Maybe two?

295
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,017
( whispers )
let's call it two.

296
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,636
- Okay
- all right.

297
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,671
- So who is it?
- Who's what?

298
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,439
- The office cheat, who is it?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

299
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,108
Is it that little
prick bradley?

300
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,677
He always looks like
he's trying to fuck his
assistant when I'm there.

301
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,780
- It's not bradley.
- Steve ball, the guy
in the music department?

302
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,982
- 'cause he dresses
like a cad.
- It's not him.

303
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,751
All right, well,
don't keep me guessing.
Who is it?

304
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,452
What does it matter?

305
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,571
You don't want
to tell me.

306
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:47,125
We've been together for
23 years and you don't want--

307
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,627
You don't want to tell me.

308
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,581
You know the number
on my checking account,
for god's--

309
00:13:55,184 --> 00:13:57,185
Go fuck yourself.

310
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:01,389
Unbelievable.

311
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,959
Wow, that is not so hard.

312
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,095
Did you see that, kids?
I'm putting for a birdie.

313
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:09,564
- Jeffrey.
- Go fuck yourself.

314
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,018
I found your ball,
mr. Gold.

315
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,221
That's good work, lloyd.

316
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,389
Now go find this.

317
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,651
God damn it!

318
00:14:29,685 --> 00:14:33,154
- Your brother's
got some temper, huh?
- Yeah, he's a little fiery.

319
00:14:33,188 --> 00:14:35,473
It's only 'cause you guys
questioned my handicap.

320
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,326
- It totally threw me.
- Aw, we're sorry we got
in your head, Drama.

321
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,378
I mean, I know how stable
you normally are.

322
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:42,513
You didn't get in my head.
Only I can get in my head.

323
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,098
And I did.

324
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,017
Why don't we give
your head a break
and just call it off?

325
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,852
No, my head
don't need a break.

326
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,388
In fact, to prove it,
let's double the bet.

327
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,557
- Johnny.
- Don't worry about it, bro.

328
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,492
Super bowl mvp,

329
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,594
Oscar nominee don't
mean shit out here.

330
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,230
A handicap's a handicap
and I'm gonna play
under mine.

331
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,733
- All right then.
- Yo yo.

332
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,301
What are you doing,
Turtle?

333
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,436
I got bored of e
and the octogenarian,

334
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,306
So I thought
I'd join you guys.
I brought drinks.

335
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,341
Hey, thanks, Turtle.

336
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,410
You got a good
one here.

337
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:15,113
Damn, I forgot
about you, tom.
I only brought three.

338
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,697
I'm good.
I'm used to the heat.

339
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:20,051
- Are you?
- Hey, do I know you
from somewhere?

340
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,387
Where you at the giants'
super bowl victory parade
last year?

341
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,972
Wait, are you
dating somebody?

342
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,057
- Yeah, if you can believe it.
- Who are you dating?

343
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,242
- Jamie-lynn sigler.
- <i>Oh, right.</i>

344
00:15:28,277 --> 00:15:30,929
And I just want
to say something from
the both of us.

345
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,981
- You...
- Jamie, she's awesome.

346
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,233
Yeah yeah, sweetest
girl in the world.
You know what?

347
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,603
We met at this charity
event a few years ago.
Gisele loved her.

348
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,605
Really?

349
00:15:40,656 --> 00:15:42,323
Yeah.  You know,
we should go out sometime.

350
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,626
Us?
You and gisele?

351
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,995
Yeah, or just come
over to the house.
She cooks.

352
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,897
Gisele cooks?
That's awesome.

353
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:53,034
Why don't you stop
staring at the guy like you
want to fuck him, Turtle?

354
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:54,819
What?

355
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:57,355
You want to get off
the tee box?  I'm trying
to win some money here.

356
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:58,790
When we're done
with you, Drama,

357
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,741
You ain't gonna have nothing
left but that sag pension.

358
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,210
Yeah, we'll see.

359
00:16:02,244 --> 00:16:03,411
Hey, should we
bring anything?

360
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,813
A nice bottle of wine
or dessert or something?

361
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:08,082
Yeah yeah.
She likes chocolate.

362
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,550
Chocolate?
Done.

363
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:14,639
- Ooh.
- Fuck!  God damn it!

364
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,324
I'm telling you,
it's the club.

365
00:16:16,358 --> 00:16:18,276
I just had
it regripped, man.
Something's up.

366
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,012
Come on, Johnny, let it go.
You're having an off day,
that's all.

367
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,948
- Take another one, buddy.
- Yeah?

368
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,817
Why don't you use this club?
Works pretty good for me.

369
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:28,302
Really?
You sure you don't mind?

370
00:16:28,337 --> 00:16:30,955
This is a bet.
I don't want to be taking
anything off anyone.

371
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,474
Oh, yeah.

372
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,662
That's nice.
No wonder I'm getting smoked.

373
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:40,198
What is this, custom?
Mine's off the rack.

374
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,600
Oh, yeah.

375
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,760
Fuck!
God damn!

376
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:54,862
Fucking god damn--

377
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,684
<i>Sorry.</i>

378
00:16:59,735 --> 00:17:02,553
You broke tom brady's
club, you asshole.

379
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:05,423
Sorry about that, tom.

380
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,442
Ahem.
Hey.

381
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,777
Hey.
How was your day?

382
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,078
Not bad.
Can we talk?

383
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,746
Uh, yeah.
Just one second.

384
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,782
If you would excuse me,
I'll be right back.

385
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,151
Thank you.

386
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,405
- What's up?
- It was your idea for me
to play with murray.

387
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:39,140
- Well...
- You said it was his.

388
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:40,908
It was his.
I just told him

389
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:42,977
That you shut down
your business and you
might be available.

390
00:17:43,011 --> 00:17:44,612
Well, how'd you know that?

391
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,380
My friend is dating one
of your ex-clients.

392
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:48,015
You seem to have
a lot of friends.

393
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,985
Well, don't hate me
because I'm popular.

394
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:55,523
What is the problem?

395
00:17:55,557 --> 00:17:57,258
The problem is you treat me
like I'm some kind of

396
00:17:57,292 --> 00:17:58,859
Social experiment
or something.

397
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:02,330
- What do you mean?
- First you find me
a place to live,

398
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:03,998
Now you're trying to get
your godfather to hire me?

399
00:18:04,032 --> 00:18:06,434
- These are bad things?
- But why are you doing them?

400
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:08,770
Because I care about you.

401
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:10,204
I thought you didn't
want to be friends.

402
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,590
I said I couldn't
be friends right now.

403
00:18:12,641 --> 00:18:14,092
And that's because
I care too much.

404
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,709
So what, you want to see
if you can turn me

405
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,678
Into the man you want,
then you'll consider
talking to me?

406
00:18:17,712 --> 00:18:20,681
Eric, I have no idea what
you're being so hostile about.

407
00:18:20,715 --> 00:18:22,900
I'm hostile because
while you may just think
I'm vince's bitch,

408
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,718
I've done pretty
okay for myself.

409
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,988
I don't need you
out there begging people
to offer me things.

410
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,656
I didn't beg anybody.

411
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,408
I told someone about you

412
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,410
And I thought you guys
might make a good match.

413
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,262
And apparently he agrees

414
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:36,230
Because he's not some schmuck
that's just gonna go

415
00:18:36,265 --> 00:18:38,116
And hand out jobs
because I tell him to.

416
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:41,085
And I don't think
of you as vince's bitch.
But clearly you do.

417
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,905
- Maybe you
don't know me so well.
- I think I do.

418
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:46,340
Yeah, well, I told murray
I don't want the job, so what
do you think of that?

419
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,643
- I think you're an idiot.
- Whatever.

420
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,804
- Yes!
- ( cheering )

421
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:02,306
- Was that an eagle?
- Yes, sir.

422
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,176
- Is that an eagle?
- Well played, jeffrey.

423
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,812
I told you not to speak to me.
How's that, kids?

424
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,213
Come on, jeff.

425
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,182
When trust goes out
of the relationship,

426
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,117
I mean, what's left?

427
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,852
I mean, I don't think--

428
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,255
- I don't think we can
do business anymore.
- Jeff, come on.

429
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,890
- Listen.
- I have to think about this.

430
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,491
I think
he just fired you.

431
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,827
He fires me all the time.
Don't worry, it won't stick.

432
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,196
- You played well, mr. Gold.
- Run to that next sand trap.

433
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,298
Run to the--

434
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,066
- Man: <i>Mr. Gold.</i>
- Yeah?

435
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,136
Mr. Gold, we were
wondering if you could verify
mr. Tambor's scorecard.

436
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,623
- Verify it?
- He claims he shot a 55.

437
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,225
Course record.

438
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,211
I wasn't counting.

439
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:45,082
These greens
were rolled like shit.
It was like putting on glass.

440
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,218
I feel bad taking this
money from you, vince,

441
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:48,903
Especially since you
played pretty good.

442
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:52,306
Don't sweat it, tom.
I just got paid $4 million
to do the voice of a dog.

443
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,242
And the chase brothers
are no welchers.

444
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,078
- Why don't we just donate
the money to this charity?
- Good idea.

445
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:00,114
Unless it's a charity
for c-list actors who
suck at golf.

446
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:01,866
I don't suck at golf.
I had an off day.

447
00:20:01,917 --> 00:20:04,318
Next time we see each other
it's gonna be payback time.

448
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,536
Oh, I look forward
to it, Drama.

449
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:07,538
You want to roll another 18?
Let's go?

450
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,607
- I will never
play with you again.
- Right now, come on.

451
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,260
Hey, tom, could you ever see
yourself in a giants' jersey?

452
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,929
That blue would really
match your eyes.

453
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:18,015
- How was your day, boys?
- Having dinner at
tom brady's house.

454
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,851
- You know he's not
a make a wish kid, right?
- ( laughing )

455
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,104
Jeffrey:
<i>You guys laughing at ari?</i>

456
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,939
Don't you know
he's the devil?

457
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:28,476
You want to extricate
yourself from his
destructive powers.

458
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,896
- He fire you again?
- Uh-huh.

459
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,015
You know, I don't even
know what he'd offer me.

460
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,318
But I assume I'd have
the freedom to do a lot.

461
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:40,288
- So why would
you turn it down?
- I don't know.

462
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,156
It just didn't feel like
the right opportunity.

463
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,792
- You say this guy's a legend?
- Yeah.

464
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:48,045
- And you can learn
a lot from him?
- Yeah.

465
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,832
So everything
you're describing sounds
perfect for you.

466
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:54,085
- At's holding you back?
- I don't know.

467
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,638
Maybe you should reconsider.

468
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:01,058
You know, just meet with him.
Get a feel for the place.

469
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,728
- Yeah, maybe you're right.
- Yeah.

470
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,981
- You want some more wine?
- Sure.

471
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,483
Sorry, Sloan.

472
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,221
What?

473
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,523
You just called me Sloan.

474
00:21:15,557 --> 00:21:18,109
- I did?
- Yeah.
