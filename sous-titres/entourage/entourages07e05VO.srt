17
00:01:26,203 --> 00:01:28,204
you read a book a week?

18
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:30,306
Some of them
don't even have pictures.

19
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,341
I'm not... I'm not trying
to be insulting.

20
00:01:32,376 --> 00:01:34,243
I'm just impressed
if I read a book a month.

21
00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:36,645
I'm sure you have
bigger priorities.

22
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,248
Okay, now you're insulting me.
I got it.

23
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:42,485
How do I know that girl
Vince is talking to?

24
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,320
No clue.
I've never seen her.

25
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,789
Sure you have.
That's Sasha Grey.

26
00:01:46,823 --> 00:01:48,758
The porn star?!

27
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:50,860
<i>Oh yeah!</i>

28
00:01:50,894 --> 00:01:53,963
And she did Soderbergh's
movie, so she's legit now.

29
00:01:53,997 --> 00:01:55,731
I read for that.

30
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:59,402
- Yo, boys.
- Hey, Scotty!

31
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:02,438
Hey, I want to thank you all for the
invite out with the internal crew.

32
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:04,874
- It means a lot to me.
- Now that e can tolerate you.

33
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:07,043
- You hear from Stamos?
- No. You believe it?

34
00:02:07,077 --> 00:02:09,211
The guy probably hasn't
even read the script yet.

35
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:11,013
It's 40 pages.
How long could it take?

36
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,582
Relax, drama. If he doesn't call
you by tomorrow, I'll call him.

37
00:02:13,617 --> 00:02:15,051
- Thanks, e.
- Where's Vince?

38
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:17,553
At the bar
talking to Sasha Grey.

39
00:02:17,587 --> 00:02:20,656
No. The anal
specialist, oh my God.

40
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,726
<i>- Turtle: Think Vince knows who she is?
- No way.</i>

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,961
- Maybe we should tell him.
- He'll find out later.

42
00:02:25,996 --> 00:02:27,463
Way more fun coming from her.

43
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:29,999
Actions do speak
louder than words.

44
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:32,001
Oh God, I bet her ass
sings opera.

45
00:02:32,035 --> 00:02:34,537
<i>- ( Drama laughs )
- I've never done the ass.</i>

46
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,239
- Really? Oh, you should.
- Is it that great?

47
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:40,543
Are you kidding?
Vagina's my third favorite hole, bro.

48
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,678
- Nice.
- What about you, e?

49
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:45,714
- None of your business.
- That's a no.

50
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,883
- You an ass virgin, e?
- Yeah, drama, unlike you

51
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,518
my ass remains untouched.

52
00:02:49,553 --> 00:02:51,787
Wait a minute, e.
You've gotta try it at least once

53
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:53,589
before you get married.
You have to!

54
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:55,224
Aw, Sloan's not
that kind of girl.

55
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,027
- And I mean that in a good way.
- I'm not talking about Sloan.

56
00:02:58,061 --> 00:03:00,863
You gotta find, like, a civilian broad.
Get it out of your system.

57
00:03:00,897 --> 00:03:03,099
It's not in my system,
so let's move on.

58
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:05,868
I'd like to stay right
here for a second, e,

59
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:07,770
and I say this
with all due respect...

60
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:11,207
If it's about Sloan or her ass,
please don't say anything at all.

61
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:13,342
You gotta do it
before you get married.

62
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:16,579
You wait 10 years to ask, she's gonna
think it's because you're not happy.

63
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,181
Why don't you guys just worry
about the ass you're not getting?

64
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:22,051
- Please.
- I'm getting closer by the minute.

65
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:23,919
- With what?
- A cute girl.

66
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,388
- Tell him. - Yeah, she's cute,
but he ain't getting any closer.

67
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:28,891
<i>- We made out all night.
- ( Scott cackles )</i>

68
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:31,393
You made out all night where?
At the freshmen dance?

69
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:33,896
It was a business meeting that
turned into a makeout session.

70
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,798
Business he won't
tell us anything about.

71
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:37,733
You'll hear about it
soon enough.

72
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:40,703
- We're holding our breath.
- Guys, this is Sasha.

73
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:42,571
All:
Hey, how you doing?

74
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:45,441
I just want to say I loved you
in "the girlfriend experience."

75
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,443
- Thank you.
- How was working with Soderbergh?

76
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,411
- Amazing.
- Yeah, I bet.

77
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:50,913
<i>If it makes you feel
any better</i>

78
00:03:50,947 --> 00:03:53,349
I read for your old show five
times and didn't get it.

79
00:03:53,383 --> 00:03:56,185
- It does actually.
- If the roles were reversed

80
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:58,687
we could have watched drama
in "the boyfriend experience."

81
00:03:58,722 --> 00:04:00,556
And all the hard research
leading up to it.

82
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,659
<i>- She's funny, Vin.
- And she reads.</i>

83
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:07,062
Her porn name came from Oscar Wilde's
"the picture of Dorian gray."

84
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:09,832
<i>- How hot is that?
- I guess he does know who she is.</i>

85
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:14,003
<i>- We're gonna take off.
- Turtle/drama: Later.</i>

86
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:16,071
He's got a big meeting tomorrow.
Don't keep him out too late.

87
00:04:16,106 --> 00:04:17,973
Don't worry.
We're going straight to bed.

88
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,909
She's gonna give me
lessons in her craft.

89
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:22,211
- That's fucked up.
- I got all her DVDs.

90
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:25,181
I will give them to you so you can
see what you're missing tonight.

91
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,317
Give them to e so he can see what
he's been missing his whole life.

92
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,288
- Ow ow!
- Sorry, baby.

93
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:35,257
- Why are you so angry?
- Do I seem angry?

94
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,962
Sorry, I am a little bit angry, baby.

95
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:43,365
- It's Lizzie Grant.
- You were thinking about her

96
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,167
while you were
having sex with me?

97
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,869
You think I'm happy about it?!

98
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:49,505
- Do you have some confession
to make or something? - What?

99
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,074
No, she's going after
my clients is all.

100
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:55,544
Do you really think that she's a
viable candidate to replace you?

101
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:58,347
Well, since the merger
and now with the n.F.L.,

102
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,249
I've... I've neglected
some of them.

103
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:02,618
Yeah, you've been neglecting
some other people too.

104
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:04,954
- Who?
- Are you kidding me?

105
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:06,722
Baby, we were just having sex.

106
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:08,791
<i>- You were having sex.
- Oh, come...</i>

107
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:11,427
that's what marriage is for, so
you can bang out your anger.

108
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:14,129
- Oh my God.
- I'm sure you've done it to me, baby.

109
00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:16,765
You can't just leave me like this.
Come on!

110
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:19,068
How am I gonna work?!

111
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:21,470
Work yourself, Ari.

112
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:28,611
Morning, Ari.
Why are you walking angry?

113
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:31,413
- Has Lizzie Grant contacted any
of your clients? - No no no.

114
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:34,883
- But I heard she's talking to Aaron Sorkin.
- I heard Jessica Simpson too.

115
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,919
- Who is she working for?
- Lloyd: Mmmm.

116
00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:39,922
Okay, people,
we are at war here!

117
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:43,626
Former colleague Lizzie Grant
is trying to take clients

118
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,128
- from this agency.
- She called Mike Tyson.

119
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:48,097
She's calling
the sports department.

120
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:50,499
Okay, who is she working for?
C.A.A.?

121
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:53,168
<i>I.C.M.?
Let's make it simple.</i>

122
00:05:53,203 --> 00:05:55,838
I have never allowed any Agent

123
00:05:55,872 --> 00:05:58,007
to leave and take
a client with them.

124
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,975
I'm not about
to allow it to happen today.

125
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:04,113
Any one of your clients, I don't
care how big or how small,

126
00:06:04,147 --> 00:06:08,317
if they're wavering, tell me.
I will personally go and talk to them.

127
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:10,286
Jake!

128
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,655
Yes, Ari?

129
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:15,524
You're about to witness
what made me who I am today.

130
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:18,560
Call Aaron Sorkin, Mike Tyson
and Jessica Simpson.

131
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:19,728
Now!

132
00:06:19,763 --> 00:06:22,498
- Who should I start with?
- Figure it out.

133
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,869
You want to take me to the nuart
for a Godard double feature?

134
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:29,471
- You could use some culture.
- Who the fuck are you?

135
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:32,641
Just a cool chick
who likes art and sex.

136
00:06:32,676 --> 00:06:36,111
Mmm, I know that's not drama's
crappy cooking I smell.

137
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,113
I hope you like pancakes.

138
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,916
I like the way they smell, so I'm
sure I'll like the way they taste.

139
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,319
- Hey look, I got Mickey mouse.
- Aww.

140
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:46,588
- What do you got for me?
- How about this one?

141
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:49,425
- I'd prefer tits.
- That's fucking rude.

142
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,962
- I'm kidding.
- She really is funny.

143
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:57,232
- I think a sitcom's in my future.
- The next Mary Tyler Moore.

144
00:06:57,267 --> 00:06:59,001
<i>What do you
got there, turtle?</i>

145
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:01,170
- My future.
- Tequila?

146
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:03,872
- Yep.
- Ooh, I love Tequila.

147
00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:05,741
- Bust it open.
- Now?

148
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:08,143
- What better way to start the day?
- Totally.

149
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,245
- Okay.
- So this is the business?

150
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,715
Well, I wanted you
to taste it first

151
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:15,184
so you could tell me if you
think there is a business.

152
00:07:15,218 --> 00:07:17,553
Oh, e called... wanted to make sure
you're gonna be at your meeting on time.

153
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:20,856
Tell him I'm not.
But I will be.

154
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,025
<i>Well, to a good meeting</i>

155
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:24,793
that will lead
to a great movie.

156
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:28,097
- Movies. Sounds like a franchise.
- Let's hope.

157
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:32,735
- You like?
- That's very good.

158
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:35,037
- Very smooth. - I'm not crazy, right?
It's good shit.

159
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:37,373
- No, so what do they want you to do?
- Promote.

160
00:07:37,407 --> 00:07:39,341
Oh, you can definitely do that.

161
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,310
Maybe you want to get
involved also?

162
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:43,278
Sure.
What do you want me to do?

163
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:46,248
- I'm gonna talk to e about that.
- Okay.

164
00:07:46,282 --> 00:07:48,517
Here's a good luck pancake.

165
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,452
You are an artist.

166
00:07:50,487 --> 00:07:52,554
Cheers.

167
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:54,123
Same.

168
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:57,693
- One more.
- Yeah.

169
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,561
<i>- One more, one more.
- You're drinking all my stuff.</i>

170
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:02,998
Stamos is obviously not calling
me, so I need you to call him.

171
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:05,000
<i>- I already left word.
- Well, leave word again!</i>

172
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:07,669
- Because something's definitely up.
- Relax, drama!

173
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:10,372
I can't relax, e.
I got no job, no auditions, nothing.

174
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,575
I will call again and as soon as I
hear something I will call you back.

175
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,845
<i>- Okay?
- Okay. Later.</i>

176
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:19,782
- Morning, Jennie.
- Morning.

177
00:08:19,816 --> 00:08:22,117
- Any word from stamos yet?
- Uh, no, but...

178
00:08:22,152 --> 00:08:24,653
Bizarrely enough, Bob
Saget is in your office.

179
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:26,488
Why?

180
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,862
<i>- Hey, Bob.
- Hey, Eric.</i>

181
00:08:33,897 --> 00:08:36,832
What kind of phone do you use?

182
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:38,901
A blackberry.

183
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,335
Blackberry?
Can I see it?

184
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,237
<i>- Why?
- I'm thinking of switching</i>

185
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:45,040
but I don't want to do anything
rash, so I want to see it first.

186
00:08:45,074 --> 00:08:46,642
- May I?
- Yeah sure.

187
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:48,677
Thanks.

188
00:08:51,214 --> 00:08:53,182
- Christ.
- What?

189
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:55,117
I have a blackberry, Eric.

190
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:57,286
I rolled through your calls.
You haven't changed your number.

191
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,022
I called you four times this
morning and you ignored me.

192
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:03,025
I just walked in the door.
You were going to be my first call.

193
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:06,829
You think if I call you four times, it
could maybe be something important?

194
00:09:06,863 --> 00:09:10,499
I don't call anybody four times in a
row unless I'm trying to fuck them.

195
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,468
Bob, I'm here now,
so what's so important?

196
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:14,837
- Sloan's on the phone.
- Tell her I'll call her back, please?

197
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:16,605
She sounds
a little freaked out.

198
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,108
Gotta take this, Bob.
You know how it is.

199
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,677
Oh, please, be my guest.

200
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:24,480
( Phone chirps )

201
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:26,281
Hello?
Everything okay?

202
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,183
- This is awkward.
- What is?

203
00:09:28,218 --> 00:09:31,920
I wasn't snooping.
I was just on looking for our registry

204
00:09:31,955 --> 00:09:35,257
and happened to see your
search history on the computer.

205
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:38,227
<i>- Yeah, and?
- Did you Google anal sex?</i>

206
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:43,665
- Uh...
- I mean, I hope it was for me

207
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,967
and not someone else, 'cause...

208
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,135
Well yeah, I mean,
of course it was for you.

209
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,171
I just... I thought maybe...

210
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:50,806
Maybe you wanted to try it.

211
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,509
E, we've tried it once.

212
00:09:53,543 --> 00:09:55,310
You couldn't look at me.

213
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,480
You just kept patting me on the
head saying you were sorry.

214
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:02,417
Well yeah, I know. I thought maybe we were
doing it wrong so I googled the steps.

215
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:03,685
Yeah, I read that.

216
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,123
- Eric!
- Uh, Sloan, I have Bob Saget

217
00:10:08,157 --> 00:10:10,092
- in my office.
- Oh my God.

218
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:12,995
<i>- Am I on speaker?
- No, but could we, uh,</i>

219
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,796
could we talk
about this tonight?

220
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:17,099
<i>- Maybe.
- Maybe?</i>

221
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:19,134
Yeah, I might be
hiding from you tonight.

222
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,203
Okay, I love you.
Bye.

223
00:10:21,237 --> 00:10:23,238
Love you.

224
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:28,477
Were you just talking about
ass sex or something?

225
00:10:30,313 --> 00:10:33,615
What can I do for you, Bob?
I'll tell you what you can do for me, Eric.

226
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,685
I read a script this morning...
a really great script.

227
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,587
A friend gave it to me.
I want to do it.

228
00:10:38,621 --> 00:10:40,322
Okay, what is it?
I'll get right into it.

229
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:44,026
- I've already gotten into it.
Stamos sent it to me. - Jesus.

230
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,894
You sent it to stamos?

231
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:49,698
Stamos and I have been trying to do something
together since "full house" ended.

232
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,267
And now you... my manager
is trying to keep me from it?

233
00:10:52,302 --> 00:10:55,637
- Bob, that is not how it happened.
- I am perfect for this.

234
00:10:55,672 --> 00:10:58,941
- Phil Wagoda thinks so also.
- You spoke to Phil Wagoda?

235
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:02,377
Yes, I did. Which means there's
no commission in this for you.

236
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,914
And I still may even fire you.
I'm weighing my options.

237
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:11,587
What I need really is
a steady respectable job.

238
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:13,622
Something 9:00 to 5:00,
you know?

239
00:11:13,656 --> 00:11:16,058
- I need more structure in my life.
- I'm not following you.

240
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,926
Are you talking about
something in sales?

241
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:20,562
Because I think the intimidation
factor could work in your favor

242
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,497
- or it could be a liability.
- No no.

243
00:11:22,532 --> 00:11:25,367
I want to do a real TV show.
A real one.

244
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:27,402
Okay...

245
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,304
- Uh...
- Scripted scripted.

246
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:32,074
Scripted? Oh, I could see you
being like the next Detective

247
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,942
- on like a "C.S.I.," huh?
- No no.

248
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:36,044
I want to do
the black "Brady bunch."

249
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,547
I'm trying to rehab my image.
I want to dispense

250
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:41,750
some of this worldly wisdom that I
picked up on my journey in life.

251
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,886
Then if Bobby doesn't listen
to you, you bite his ear off.

252
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,491
- It was a joke, Mike.
- But it wasn't funny, Ari.

253
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:51,126
- Okay?
- Well...

254
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,329
- It just wasn't funny.
- Listen, I'm going to get into it.

255
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:56,198
I also have a call
into Todd Phillips

256
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:58,567
to make sure he puts you
in that "hangover" sequel.

257
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:01,069
Hey, Todd Phillips knows not
to fuck me out of that sequel.

258
00:12:01,104 --> 00:12:03,972
I need more money and I need
more talking time.

259
00:12:04,007 --> 00:12:06,408
Listen, you got it.
I just need one thing from you.

260
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:08,677
I need a commitment
to this agency.

261
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:10,912
Don't fuck with me, all right?

262
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:13,281
Let's not fuck each other.
There we go.

263
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,451
- All right, you got it, buddy.
- Ari, Jessica Simpson's on one.

264
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,021
Ooh, she'd be
a hot Carol Brady.

265
00:12:19,055 --> 00:12:20,922
Show me you're working for me.
Show me.

266
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:24,026
- ( Phone rings ) - Prove all that
lip service you've been giving me.

267
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,829
- Jess, how are you? - Are you seriously
trying to summon me in for a meeting?

268
00:12:27,864 --> 00:12:30,832
- What? No. - I haven't heard
from you in over a year

269
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:33,035
and your assistant said you want
me to come in for a meeting.

270
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:35,504
I would love for you
to come in for a meeting.

271
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:37,239
- Ask her.
- I just want to tell you

272
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:39,641
how sorry I am about
the loss of your dog.

273
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,177
- That was a year ago!
- It's still horrible.

274
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:44,513
<i>And you never
called to say sorry.</i>

275
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:47,416
Jess, I am... I am so...
I am so sorry.

276
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,519
<i>- It's too late, Ari. I'm going with Lizzie.
- Go with her where?</i>

277
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:52,254
<i>C.A.A.?</i>

278
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:53,789
Jess?

279
00:12:53,823 --> 00:12:57,225
- ( Whispers ) Ask!
- What do you think about doing a remake

280
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,628
of the "Brady bunch"
with Mike Tyson

281
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:02,964
as Mike Brady?
You love it?

282
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:06,468
<i>- Okay, that's fantastic.
- Money in the bank, baby.</i>

283
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,573
- Are you nervous?
- No, because you're coming with me.

284
00:13:11,607 --> 00:13:13,909
- Really?
- Unless you think you'll be bored?

285
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:16,978
- I'm never bored. - Oh good, then
you can be my manager for the day.

286
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:19,715
- Does that mean I get to tell
you what to do? - You can try,

287
00:13:19,749 --> 00:13:21,450
<i>- t I don't always listen.
- Really?</i>

288
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:24,252
- That the shirt you're gonna wear?
- No good?

289
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:27,189
I mean, it's cool, but you look
a little sloppy for a meeting.

290
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:30,158
( Both chuckle )

291
00:13:30,193 --> 00:13:32,260
I'll be right back.

292
00:13:32,295 --> 00:13:34,196
I'll kill Bob Saget.

293
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,065
No, I'm serious.
I will actually kill him.

294
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,135
Did you talk to Phil
about this?

295
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:42,304
- He's not returning my calls.
- Then I'll kill Phil.

296
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:44,139
He's probably dealing
with the network.

297
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:46,141
You have to learn to be
a little patient, drama.

298
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:48,777
- Have you at least heard
from stamos? - Yes.

299
00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:50,645
He loves it and he would
do it with you,

300
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,415
but he and Bob are best friends,
so what's he supposed to do?

301
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:55,984
It's not called "show friends,"
it's called "show business"!

302
00:13:56,018 --> 00:13:57,986
<i>- Drama, you need to calm down.
- No no.</i>

303
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,088
You've got to get up
and get angry.

304
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:02,090
This script was written for me

305
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,159
and Bob Saget steals it?!

306
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,096
He's a fucking dead man.

307
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:10,732
<i>He's a fucking dead man.</i>

308
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,635
Drama, where are you going?

309
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:15,403
To talk to Saget!

310
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,140
- Don't do anything stupid.
- Do I ever?

311
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,309
Eric, turtle's on the phone.

312
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:23,211
Put it through.

313
00:14:23,246 --> 00:14:25,514
<i>- Hey, what's going on?
- Are you busy?</i>

314
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:27,816
- Yeah, kind of. What's up?
- I need a meeting.

315
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,050
<i>- With who?
- With you.</i>

316
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:30,719
<i>- About what?
- About Vince.</i>

317
00:14:30,753 --> 00:14:32,854
Oh boy,
this doesn't sound good.

318
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:35,123
Don't be so negative.
I want to take you for lunch.

319
00:14:35,158 --> 00:14:37,626
Just tell me what's going on.
I don't have time for lunch.

320
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,928
<i>- Then I'll come there then.
- Don't come here!</i>

321
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,696
- I'll see you in 20.
- Uh...

322
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,034
Lloyd: It feels like old times.

323
00:14:46,068 --> 00:14:49,070
- You want a demotion?
- Oh, papa Ari is cranky

324
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:51,206
because he hasn't chased
clients in a while.

325
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,241
I'm not cranky.
I'm just in the zone.

326
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:56,244
- Hide the dog. - He's a puppy, Ari.
Look at the little guy.

327
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,113
Hide the dog.

328
00:15:01,184 --> 00:15:03,485
Look who it is... the guy
that used to be my Agent.

329
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,320
- That's not nice.
- I'm on a tight schedule,

330
00:15:05,354 --> 00:15:08,056
- so let's make the groveling quick.
- No groveling.

331
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,559
- Just a gift.
- Ta-DA!

332
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:12,761
- What the hell?
- I know how devastated you were

333
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:16,264
after losing little Daisy, so I thought
little rose here would ease the pain.

334
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:18,200
- You really are an asshole.
- I know.

335
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:21,636
I didn't call. I never called.
I don't deal well with death.

336
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,772
- Have you ever had a dog, Ari?
- I-I have one now.

337
00:15:23,806 --> 00:15:26,474
You should know they're not like cars.
You don't just replace them.

338
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,810
- Look how Fluffy she is.
- Hi, I'm Fluffy.

339
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,780
- I've been talking to Lizzie.
- And who? Who's she with?

340
00:15:31,814 --> 00:15:34,082
- She seems to get me.
- She's a teenager.

341
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:35,951
- And you clearly don't.
- Jess.

342
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:38,386
And Daisy was a maltipoo.
That's just a poo.

343
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:41,256
Asshole.

344
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,092
You got her the wrong breed?

345
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:47,262
- You gave me 30 minutes.
That's all they had. - Idiot.

346
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:49,097
Can I keep him?
I'm already attached.

347
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:50,332
( Kisses )

348
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,667
I always wanted to fuck the
hulk when I was younger.

349
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,302
- Is that weird?
- Uh, a little.

350
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:56,404
What about aquaman?
You want to fuck him?

351
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:58,440
- I liked the sequel better.
- Pfft.

352
00:15:58,474 --> 00:16:01,376
- I'm kidding.
- Look, the shocker.

353
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,978
You're gross.

354
00:16:03,012 --> 00:16:05,480
- Oh, and you're so innocent.
- You're sick. You're sick.

355
00:16:05,514 --> 00:16:07,682
- An innocent girl, huh?
- You're sick.

356
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,952
Vince, Randall and Stan
are ready for you.

357
00:16:10,987 --> 00:16:12,587
We're ready for them.

358
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:14,689
Yeah...

359
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:18,793
<i>- Vinnie Chase!
- Hey, Randall.</i>

360
00:16:18,828 --> 00:16:20,295
- So good to see you again.
- You too.

361
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:23,265
- This is Sasha. - And this is
the man, the myth, the legend,

362
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:25,000
- Stan Lee.
- Hi.

363
00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:27,135
- So nice to meet you, Stan.
- Oh, you as well.

364
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:30,906
And Sasha...
oh, you look familiar.

365
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,542
Well, Sasha just did Steven Soderbergh's
"the girlfriend experience."

366
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,679
Oh, I didn't see that.
What else have you done?

367
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:40,749
- I've done a bunch of stuff.
- Really? Anything I've seen?

368
00:16:40,783 --> 00:16:43,318
Uh, she's done
dozens of independents.

369
00:16:43,352 --> 00:16:45,954
<i>At your age?
Boy, that's terrific.</i>

370
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:47,489
( Giggling )

371
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:50,959
Get down here, Bob,
and take your beating.

372
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:53,295
Drama, you're acting insane.
Put the bat down.

373
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:55,630
Yeah, leave him alone.
Bob is a good man.

374
00:16:55,665 --> 00:16:57,866
Yeah, a good man who's
trying to steal my life!

375
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,335
<i>- I didn't steal anything!
- Oh yeah?</i>

376
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:02,504
A guy writes a script for me,

377
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:04,773
and you just swoop in
and take it?

378
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:08,877
Now get down here before
I start smashing cars!

379
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:11,379
Please don't hit the Volkswagen!
That one is mine.

380
00:17:11,414 --> 00:17:13,915
<i>Bob:
Who says he wrote it for you?</i>

381
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,351
Roger Jay says.

382
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:19,220
- The writer?
- I know Roger, drama.

383
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:21,356
He told that to everybody.

384
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,159
He gave it to me six months ago.
I just never opened it.

385
00:17:24,193 --> 00:17:25,760
Yeah right!

386
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,729
Come inside.
We'll call Roger together.

387
00:17:27,763 --> 00:17:30,465
- I'll prove it to you.
- Are you kidding?

388
00:17:30,499 --> 00:17:32,867
My hand to God.

389
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,604
Jesus Christ.

390
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,674
I'll give you a blowjob if
it'll make you feel better.

391
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,811
What? I'm just trying to
make him feel better.

392
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:45,814
I've got sunnin
coming in for lunch.

393
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:47,649
Great kebabs.

394
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:49,718
I don't want kebabs, Bob.

395
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:51,786
I want a life.

396
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,989
I'm sorry, drama.

397
00:17:54,023 --> 00:17:56,091
I really am.

398
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,660
- Are you out of your mind?
- You're not even listening to me.

399
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:01,129
I heard every word you said,
turtle, not one of which I like.

400
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,864
- Why not?
- Because Vince isn't going

401
00:18:02,898 --> 00:18:05,533
to be the face of some Tequila company.
He's not aunt Jemima.

402
00:18:05,568 --> 00:18:08,303
You know, I could have just asked
him, skipped right over you.

403
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,038
And I appreciate that,
but still.

404
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:12,207
He just gave you 30 grand
for your car service.

405
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:13,708
The car service ain't working.

406
00:18:13,743 --> 00:18:16,044
I'm sorry about that.
I know how hard you tried.

407
00:18:16,078 --> 00:18:18,380
Can you at least consider how
hard I would try on this?

408
00:18:18,414 --> 00:18:20,515
Okay, I just got off the
phone with Randall Wallace.

409
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:22,851
<i>- How'd the meeting go?
- Not great.</i>

410
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:24,686
- Vince brought Sasha.
- Come on.

411
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,955
- Yeah, and apparently he was drunk.
- Drunk?

412
00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:28,690
Vince?

413
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,860
( Laughs ) I wasn't drunk.

414
00:18:31,894 --> 00:18:33,995
<i>E: Well, they said you
smelled like Mexico.</i>

415
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,564
That's 'cause I had some of
turtle's Tequila for breakfast.

416
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,466
<i>But I totally sobered up
before I got there.</i>

417
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:40,568
<i>I'm not dumb enough to go
to a meeting drunk, e.</i>

418
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:43,772
- Yeah, but you're dumb enough to
bring a porn star. - ( Both gasp )

419
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:46,608
I told you.
Stan Lee totally knew who you were.

420
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:49,677
I know. I saw the moment when he
placed me... he turned beet red.

421
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,313
- All right, so what did he say?
- They'd like you for the movie,

422
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:55,450
but they've seen a lot of fuck-ups in
this town and they're concerned, Vince.

423
00:18:55,484 --> 00:18:57,819
E, the truth is I had
a Vicodin this morning,

424
00:18:57,853 --> 00:19:00,388
<i>which I wouldn't have had
if I knew I'd be drinking.</i>

425
00:19:00,423 --> 00:19:04,259
- Why'd you take a Vicodin?
- My back... it's been hurting since the accident.

426
00:19:04,293 --> 00:19:07,529
E, just tell him I'm fine.
I'll go back, I'll meet him again.

427
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,865
I told him you were fine.
I also told him we needed an offer immediately.

428
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,867
Oooh, I like
the aggressive attitude.

429
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,737
<i>- All right, I'll talk to you later.
- Later.</i>

430
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,476
Would you at least try this?

431
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:24,112
- I don't have to be involved?
- Yes.

432
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:25,847
I don't know why you're
being so aggressive.

433
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:27,649
I'm just...
is Andrew coming back?

434
00:19:27,683 --> 00:19:31,019
- Have we not a had a good six months without him?
- Answer the fucking question.

435
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:33,922
No, he is not coming back.
He is a coke-fiend sex addict

436
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:37,092
who wrote checks out of this
company's account to buy hookers.

437
00:19:37,126 --> 00:19:39,027
So no, he will never
work here again.

438
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:41,362
Addiction's a disease.
You have no sympathy.

439
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:43,665
I have sympathy.
I'm just trying to help your career.

440
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:46,601
- My career's in great shape.
- It's gotten even better since you got here, right?

441
00:19:46,635 --> 00:19:49,003
- I like that Lizzie.
- Well don't, because she's bad news.

442
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:51,573
If I've gotta have an Agent, why
can't I have one who's attractive

443
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,809
- and bright and attractive?
- You know she's not gonna fuck you, right?

444
00:19:54,844 --> 00:19:56,478
I'm certain that's not
what I meant.

445
00:19:56,512 --> 00:19:58,446
- You know she fucked Andrew?
- Seriously?

446
00:19:58,481 --> 00:20:00,348
That's what caused
his whole spiral.

447
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:03,485
It wasn't the drugs.
It was her evil pussy that lured him in.

448
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:05,086
That's why I have no sympathy.

449
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,921
I know,
but you're still a douche

450
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,524
and I don't need your help
getting work or laid.

451
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:11,159
Where'd she go?
She go to u.T.A.?

452
00:20:11,193 --> 00:20:13,795
I'm... I'm sorry.
Ari, Jessica Simpson's here.

453
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:15,597
- Right now?
- Yes, what should I tell her?

454
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,665
Tell her I'll be with her
in one second.

455
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,735
I'm glad I'm leaving, that way you don't
have to end my meeting early for a pop star.

456
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:23,304
She acts as well, by the way.

457
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:25,707
<i>- Sorkin: She looks great.
- She looks perfect.</i>

458
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:27,809
And she's single.
You know what John Mayer said about her.

459
00:20:27,843 --> 00:20:30,245
- No, I don't and you're an animal.
- Sexual napalm.

460
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,280
You love the smell
of napalm in the morning.

461
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,415
- It smells like victory.
- All right.

462
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,852
Jessica!
You changed your mind.

463
00:20:37,887 --> 00:20:39,320
- I'm working on her, Ari.
- Go.

464
00:20:39,355 --> 00:20:41,723
I can't stop thinking about the dog.
I want him.

465
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:43,791
Come in, come in.
I want you to meet someone.

466
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,960
Jessica, this is
the great Aaron sorkin.

467
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,229
- Hi, it's really nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

468
00:20:48,264 --> 00:20:50,565
I saw the previews for "the social network.
" It looks great.

469
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,567
That's really nice of you
to say... and it's actually

470
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:54,736
- more than Ari's had to say about it.
- What are you talking about?

471
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,272
I'm now on Facebook because of you.
I got 600 friends.

472
00:20:57,306 --> 00:20:58,973
And John Mayer's
not one of them.

473
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:01,176
How many of those friends
actually like you, Ari?

474
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,244
- I've set the over-under at none.
- Wow.

475
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:05,213
You two play off
each other really well.

476
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:08,116
I say you kids go to dinner
and possibly you write something

477
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,618
serious for her,
like Mariah in "precious,"

478
00:21:10,653 --> 00:21:13,087
only she's younger and Southern.
It'll be amazing.

479
00:21:13,122 --> 00:21:16,391
- I may have a better idea.
Are you free? - Yeah, absolutely.

480
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:18,426
- I want the dog.
- I want a commitment

481
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,062
from both of you that you will
stay with this agency.

482
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:23,831
- For now.
- Where's the dog?

483
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,500
Lloyd!

484
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,306
- Isn't he delicious?
- Find something else to cook for dinner.

485
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,941
- Jessica's taking him.
- No...

486
00:21:32,975 --> 00:21:35,243
- Here we go, honey.
- Hi.

487
00:21:35,277 --> 00:21:36,511
- Huh?
- Hi.

488
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,580
Perfection.
Take a picture, Lloyd.

489
00:21:38,614 --> 00:21:41,349
Take a picture.
Look at that.

490
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,117
Any word when he'll be in?

491
00:21:43,152 --> 00:21:46,087
He hasn't checked in.
I'm sorry, you really should go.

492
00:21:46,121 --> 00:21:48,890
- I got nowhere to be.
- What are you doing here, drama?

493
00:21:48,924 --> 00:21:51,025
I'm not doing anything.
What are you doing here?

494
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,228
I came here to make sure you
didn't do anything stupid.

495
00:21:53,262 --> 00:21:55,530
- Phil's not here. - Yeah, I know.
I spoke to him.

496
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:59,200
- Where is he? - He's been
battling with the network all day.

497
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,103
They want Saget.

498
00:22:02,137 --> 00:22:05,139
- I wish I could've done more.
- I'm not mad at you, e.

499
00:22:05,174 --> 00:22:08,042
I'm not even mad at Saget.

500
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:11,579
It's that piece-of-shit
writer I want dead.

501
00:22:11,614 --> 00:22:13,081
You just gotta let it go.

502
00:22:13,115 --> 00:22:15,650
I mean, you were too good-looking
for that part anyway.

503
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:18,353
- Yeah.
- What part was that?

504
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,891

- Hey, turtle.
- What up?

509
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,371
I gotta say
I'm loving this Tequila.

510
00:22:36,405 --> 00:22:38,239
We're gonna have
to get some more.

511
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,608
That may have been
the last case.

512
00:22:40,643 --> 00:22:42,910
Bummer!
Why?

513
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,547
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

514
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:49,317
E says you had a rough day.
Are you okay?

515
00:22:49,351 --> 00:22:52,020
- Don't I look okay?
- Yeah.

516
00:22:52,054 --> 00:22:53,988
- I guess you do.
- ( Funny accent ) Well, good!

517
00:22:54,023 --> 00:22:56,791
Come, drink!
Tell us your troubles.

518
00:23:02,264 --> 00:23:04,399
Jesus, what are you doing here?

519
00:23:04,433 --> 00:23:07,735
I saved the most important
meeting of the day for last.

520
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,237
- Well, you seem happy.
- I am.

521
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:10,838
I set out to conquer and I did.

522
00:23:10,873 --> 00:23:13,741
- It seems I can still hustle.
- You haven't sold me yet.

523
00:23:13,776 --> 00:23:16,878
- Let me show you how much you mean to me.
- Maybe I want to hear it.

524
00:23:16,912 --> 00:23:19,380
I... Ba... can we do it after?
I can't focus.

525
00:23:19,415 --> 00:23:21,482
I still have blue balls
from this morning.

526
00:23:21,517 --> 00:23:24,185
- You lost your hustle.
- I love you.

527
00:23:24,219 --> 00:23:28,122
You are the most important
person in the world to me.

528
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:31,059
<i>I'm sorry that
I take you for granted.</i>

529
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:34,562
I owe everything to you
and you're beautiful.

530
00:23:34,596 --> 00:23:37,365
Okay, you can tell me more
after we're done.

531
00:23:39,068 --> 00:23:41,936
- Wow.
- Mmm.

534
00:23:52,448 --> 00:23:53,681
What are you doing, baby?

535
00:23:53,716 --> 00:23:55,917
I'm giving you a taste
of your own medicine.

536
00:23:55,951 --> 00:23:58,886
- Hello? - Hi, I have Amanda
Daniels calling for Ari.

537
00:23:58,921 --> 00:24:01,556
Just a second.
Amanda Daniels.

538
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:05,126
( Sighs )

539
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,195
Hello.

540
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:09,931
<i>- Good evening, Ari.
- Please don't tell me you're the one</i>

541
00:24:09,965 --> 00:24:12,600
who picked up the stray Lizzie
from the harsh gutter of life.

542
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:15,269
I couldn't believe someone who's
always had such an eye for talent

543
00:24:15,304 --> 00:24:16,971
was willing to let her go.

544
00:24:17,005 --> 00:24:19,674
<i>I think your eye has
grown cataracts,</i>

545
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,776
because as you've seen
by the day's events,

546
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,078
anyone she wants or has,

547
00:24:24,113 --> 00:24:27,749
be it a sitcom actor or a
circus freak, I'm going after.

548
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:29,951
Well, she's going
after you too, Ari.

549
00:24:29,985 --> 00:24:32,320
<i>- And I'm gonna help her.
- How's that?</i>

550
00:24:32,354 --> 00:24:34,288
I've been watching Lizzie
for a while.

551
00:24:34,323 --> 00:24:36,824
I actually offered her
a job six months ago.

552
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:40,661
She turned me down, said the future
looked very bright with you.

553
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:45,133
I said, okay, perhaps.
But in case you're wrong, just keep a journal,

554
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:48,569
<i>write down everything
that goes on over there.</i>

555
00:24:48,604 --> 00:24:50,304
<i>So she did.</i>

556
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:52,974
- So what? - So I'm going
to make your life miserable

557
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:54,709
like you once made mine.

558
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,910
Good night, Ari.

559
00:24:55,944 --> 00:24:58,212
( Clears throat )

560
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:01,115
- What was that all about? - Nothing.
Baby, let's go back to us.

561
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,317
- Are you angry?
- Uh-huh.

562
00:25:03,352 --> 00:25:05,753
I think I'll take a rain check.

563
00:25:08,824 --> 00:25:10,358
( Growls )

564
00:25:10,392 --> 00:25:12,860
I've already disappointed
enough people today.

565
00:25:12,895 --> 00:25:15,296
- We don't have to do this.
- ( Groans ) Don't move.

566
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,632
It says I move, you stay.

567
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:19,400
I'm staying.

568
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:22,170
You sure we shouldn't go back and
spend a little more time on step one?

569
00:25:22,204 --> 00:25:24,238
- Shut up.
- Sorry.

570
00:25:26,341 --> 00:25:28,042
- Is it in?
- Yes.

571
00:25:28,076 --> 00:25:29,777
- You sure?
- Shhh.

- We don't have to.

Ow, motherfucker!

00:25:55,938 --> 00:25:58,406
- Oh my God, I am so sorry.
- Why did you do that?

583
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,907
