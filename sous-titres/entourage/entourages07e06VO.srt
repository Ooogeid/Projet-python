1
00:00:01,364 --> 00:00:03,999
Drama: How do I know that
girl Vince is talkin' to?

2
00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:05,967
- Turtle: That's Sasha grey.
- The porn star?!

3
00:00:06,002 --> 00:00:10,105
Former colleague Lizzie Grant is trying
to take clients. Who's she working for?

4
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,275
Vince isn't gonna be the face of some
Tequila company. He's not aunt Jemima.

5
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,510
- I read a script this morning.
I want to do it. - Okay.

6
00:00:15,545 --> 00:00:17,179
- Stamos sent it to me.
- Jesus.

7
00:00:17,213 --> 00:00:20,882
This is awkward. I happened to see
your search history on the computer.

8
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:21,950
Can we talk about this tonight?

9
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:23,552
I might be hiding
from you tonight.

10
00:00:23,586 --> 00:00:25,654
I want Saget.
I wish I could've done more.

11
00:00:25,688 --> 00:00:29,191
- What's up, Vince? - This Tequila's special.
I want to involved.

12
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:32,594
- This is Sasha. - This is the man,
the myth, the legend... Stan Lee.

13
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:35,063
- Oh, you look familiar.
- How'd the meeting go?

14
00:00:35,098 --> 00:00:37,833
Not great. Vince brought Sasha
and apparently he was drunk.

15
00:00:37,867 --> 00:00:40,001
<i>- Good evening, Ari.
- Ari: Please don't tell me</i>

16
00:00:40,036 --> 00:00:41,470
<i>you're the one who
picked up the stray Lizzie.</i>

17
00:00:41,504 --> 00:00:43,839
Anyone she wants,
I'm going after.

18
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,741
Well, she's going
after you too, Ari.

19
00:00:45,775 --> 00:00:47,743
<i>I'm going to make your life
miserable like you once made mine.</i>

20
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:49,778
Good night, Ari.

We're having our own private launch

<i>Name, Vin.
Give 'em the name.</i>

38
00:02:16,732 --> 00:02:18,133
Uh, Tequila Avion.

39
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:20,135
- ( With accent ) Avion.
- Avion.

40
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:23,471
- Huh-uh, Avion.
- Avion!

41
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:25,440
And who is this?

42
00:02:25,474 --> 00:02:27,042
This is my friend Sasha.

43
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:28,810
Aren't we more
than friends by now?

44
00:02:28,845 --> 00:02:31,046
Oh no no, we are.
We're very good friends.

45
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,982
- And this is my friend.
- Alex.

46
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:36,284
Notice how she didn't say
we're more than friends?

47
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,486
You don't make a move soon,
Turtle, I'm gonna have to.

48
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:41,289
- What, am I not here?
- I'm just saying.

49
00:02:41,324 --> 00:02:44,359
He's made moves.
We're just taking it slow.

50
00:02:44,393 --> 00:02:47,596
Real slow.
Like the 405 at rush hour. Ow.

51
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,599
Well, Alex, all I know is I've
had a lot of sex in my life

52
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:53,235
and the best sex I've ever
had was while drinking this.

53
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:55,537
Can we quote international star

54
00:02:55,571 --> 00:02:57,672
of stage and screen
Sasha grey on that?

55
00:02:57,707 --> 00:03:01,343
I'm not shy. Drink this and you'll
have the best sex of your life.

56
00:03:01,377 --> 00:03:05,013
Guys can fuck like me and girls
can fuck like a porn star.

57
00:03:05,047 --> 00:03:07,749
- ( Laughs )
- Come on, Vince.

58
00:03:07,783 --> 00:03:09,551
That was awesome.

59
00:03:09,585 --> 00:03:11,953
Oh my God.
( Shrieks )

60
00:03:11,988 --> 00:03:15,457
So what is the deal?
Are you two gonna bang or what?

61
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:17,259
Jesus, Drama.
I thought you were dead.

62
00:03:17,293 --> 00:03:20,028
No, I'm just unemployed,
sad and lonely.

63
00:03:20,062 --> 00:03:23,431
Don't worry, I'm saving a piece of
my piece of this company for you.

64
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:25,166
That makes me feel much better.

65
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:28,103
Say something on camera about it.
You're a pseudo-celeb.

66
00:03:28,137 --> 00:03:31,373
I don't drink Tequila.
I drink Johnny blue

67
00:03:31,407 --> 00:03:33,375
'cause I'm not
a pseudo-man like you.

68
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:36,077
- All right, you're out.
- I am out.

69
00:03:36,112 --> 00:03:39,581
Doesn't drink Tequila.
Huh, what a loser.

70
00:03:39,615 --> 00:03:41,082
What?

71
00:03:41,117 --> 00:03:42,584
I was gonna kiss you.

72
00:03:42,618 --> 00:03:44,920
- You've already kissed me.
- Fine, then I won't.

73
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:47,422
Why? Why do you like
teasing me so much?

74
00:03:47,456 --> 00:03:49,024
I told you, I'm not that easy.

75
00:03:49,058 --> 00:03:50,825
No, you're like breaking
into fort knox.

76
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,028
Then I guess you'd
better keep trying.

77
00:03:54,897 --> 00:03:58,199
- ( Cheering )
- Yay, Turtle.

78
00:04:01,003 --> 00:04:02,804
Okay, so what are we
looking at here?

79
00:04:02,838 --> 00:04:05,874
Well, sexual harassment maybe.
Wrongful termination possibly.

80
00:04:05,908 --> 00:04:08,009
I didn't terminate her.
She quit.

81
00:04:08,044 --> 00:04:10,679
She felt that she was overlooked
for a promotion she deserved.

82
00:04:10,713 --> 00:04:12,414
I would have given it to her.

83
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:15,617
Whose side are you on?
I didn't do anything wrong here.

84
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:17,485
Obviously Amanda Daniels
disagrees.

85
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,255
Why would she be willing to spend
her money supporting Lizzie?

86
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:22,157
- To get back at me.
- For what?

87
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:25,293
He stopped her from getting a job
she wanted once upon a time also.

88
00:04:25,328 --> 00:04:26,695
There is no case here.

89
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:28,897
You say Lizzie's written
down things you've said?

90
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:31,967
- Yes, in a journal.
- Yeah, made-up words obviously.

91
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:35,470
- Obviously. - Look, it's her
word against mine, right?

92
00:04:35,504 --> 00:04:38,640
They'll subpoena everyone in this office.
What might they say?

93
00:04:38,674 --> 00:04:40,408
What do you think
they might say?

94
00:04:40,443 --> 00:04:43,478
He told me I'd look good with a
ball gag in my mouth last week.

95
00:04:43,512 --> 00:04:45,814
- Ari.
- Lloyd!

96
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,351
- Yes?
- What would you say

97
00:04:49,385 --> 00:04:51,953
about my treatment of you
over the last five years?

98
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:54,522
- Treatment?
- This is Jim Lefkowitz, Lloyd.

99
00:04:54,557 --> 00:04:56,725
- Our attorney.
- Attorney?

100
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,494
- What's going on?
- The lovely Lizzie Grant may sue me.

101
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:02,130
And you, Lloyd, and everyone
who works here may be asked

102
00:05:02,164 --> 00:05:05,333
to describe how Ari treats his employees.
So what would you say?

103
00:05:05,368 --> 00:05:09,070
Ari has always been gracious
and lovely, fair and reasonable.

104
00:05:09,105 --> 00:05:11,639
This has been a dreamlike job
from minute one.

105
00:05:11,674 --> 00:05:13,208
And would you say that
if you were under oath,

106
00:05:13,242 --> 00:05:15,343
facing a perjury charge
and possible jail time?

107
00:05:15,378 --> 00:05:20,148
Oh God, I can't do time, Ari.
I don't think anybody in my family could.

108
00:05:20,182 --> 00:05:22,617
- I'm sorry.
- Go!

109
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:24,853
So do you think others
would speak better of him?

110
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:26,921
Worse is my guess.

111
00:05:26,956 --> 00:05:29,290
What do you suggest?

112
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:32,594
Well, I mean, you're trying to bring an N.
F.L. team to Los Angeles.

113
00:05:32,628 --> 00:05:35,997
- So? - So the N.F.L.
doesn't like controversy.

114
00:05:36,032 --> 00:05:38,700
This goes to trial, win or lose, that's over.
You know that.

115
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:40,735
And your wife and kids
won't like it either.

116
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,370
I haven't done anything wrong.

117
00:05:42,405 --> 00:05:44,873
- Jim, what do you suggest?
- I suggest you offer Ms. Grant

118
00:05:44,907 --> 00:05:47,375
a generous amount of money
to not pursue legal action.

119
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,412
I already offered her
a generous severance package.

120
00:05:50,446 --> 00:05:52,113
I'm offering her nothing else.

121
00:05:52,148 --> 00:05:54,816
I'll call her new boss
and convince her

122
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,685
not to waste her time
or her money on this thing.

123
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,056
Just make sure she doesn't
write down everything you say.

124
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,125
- She's right.
- Jake!

125
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,761
Get Amanda Daniels
on the phone.

126
00:06:08,164 --> 00:06:09,497
- Morning, E.
- Morning.

127
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:10,899
Late night?
You look tired.

128
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:12,734
I was up till 10:00
tasting wedding cakes.

129
00:06:12,768 --> 00:06:14,135
I'm not tired, I'm nauseous.

130
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,438
- Any sign of an offer for Vince?
- Mm-hmm.

131
00:06:16,472 --> 00:06:19,240
- How is it?
- Oh, I didn't look.

132
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:21,643
Okay, it's incredible.

133
00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:25,380
- Wow. Scott!
- Oh, and a Billy Walsh called.

134
00:06:25,414 --> 00:06:27,582
- Oh, come on.
- Yeah, why, who is he?

135
00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:29,884
He was supposed to be a big director for a minute.
Never heard of him?

136
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,686
- Shall I call him back?
- No, but call Ari.

137
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,555
Tell him I want to talk to
him about this. Thank you.

138
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:35,223
Yes, Murray, I know.

139
00:06:35,257 --> 00:06:37,859
Yes, Murray, I know.
Eric's here, he says hello.

140
00:06:37,893 --> 00:06:39,360
- Hi, Murray.
- He says hi, yeah.

141
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:41,629
Okay, I love you. I really do.
Have a good trip.

142
00:06:41,664 --> 00:06:44,299
- Have fun. Okay, bye. I hate myself.
- What's the problem?

143
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,868
- He wants me to babysit his house.
- He's got a nice house.

144
00:06:46,902 --> 00:06:49,270
He also has two pugs that do
nothing but snore and shit.

145
00:06:49,305 --> 00:06:51,506
- Don't worry about that.
Look at this. - What is it?

146
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,508
Vince's offer
for "air-walker."

147
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:58,580
- Back end?
- Huge, and 12 upfront.

148
00:06:58,614 --> 00:07:00,815
- Holy shit!
- ( Laughs )

149
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,784
I have Billy Walsh again.

150
00:07:02,818 --> 00:07:05,186
Tell him I'm out of town
or something like that.

151
00:07:05,221 --> 00:07:07,622
- Did you call Ari?
- I left word with his assistant.

152
00:07:07,656 --> 00:07:09,757
Call him back, tell him
we're heading down there.

153
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:11,459
- We are?
- Yes. You can be

154
00:07:11,494 --> 00:07:14,295
my eyewitness that he had
absolutely nothing to do with this.

155
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,364
I can do that.

156
00:07:16,398 --> 00:07:19,100
<i>- ( Roaring )
- ( People screaming )</i>

157
00:07:19,135 --> 00:07:22,570
Johnny, you've got
to stop drinking.

158
00:07:22,605 --> 00:07:25,240
- Why? - 'Cause you've been
going for 16 straight hours.

159
00:07:25,274 --> 00:07:27,809
<i>- So have you.
- Yeah, but I'm happy drinking.</i>

160
00:07:27,843 --> 00:07:31,045
I'm gonna keep doing it
until I get a job.

161
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,747
Maybe you should do a play.

162
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:34,816
I'd love to, bro,
but I can't afford it.

163
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,551
My mortgage rate's
ready to reset.

164
00:07:36,585 --> 00:07:39,687
Whatever movie I do next I'm making
sure there's a role in it for you.

165
00:07:39,722 --> 00:07:42,524
- Vince... - And I got your
mortgage until you find a job.

166
00:07:42,558 --> 00:07:44,792
And that will be
pretty soon I'm sure.

167
00:07:44,827 --> 00:07:47,428
How do you know, bro?
I was on a series six months ago.

168
00:07:47,463 --> 00:07:50,431
I haven't had an offer since.
Correction...

169
00:07:50,466 --> 00:07:53,401
dos equis asked me to be the least
interesting man in the world.

170
00:07:53,435 --> 00:07:56,004
Johnny, this town is
up and down, up and down.

171
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:58,106
You know that.
I mean, look at me.

172
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,175
I was done, but I came back.

173
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:02,610
- And you will too.
- I hope so, bro.

174
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:04,746
But for now, let me
wallow in my misery.

175
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,714
Stop wallowing with my Tequila.

176
00:08:06,749 --> 00:08:10,051
- I'm gonna run out of samples. - Boo.
What, are you in a bad mood too?

177
00:08:10,085 --> 00:08:12,086
- No, why?
- You look sad.

178
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:13,955
I guess he couldn't close Alex.

179
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:15,723
It was looking
pretty good to me.

180
00:08:15,758 --> 00:08:17,225
I closed.
I closed.

181
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:19,561
- Great, so how was it?
- For me or for her?

182
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:22,797
We know it couldn't have been any good
for her, so let's hear about you.

183
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:25,366
But first, have a drink.

184
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:27,602
- It's 10:00 A.M.
- Suit yourself.

185
00:08:27,636 --> 00:08:29,737
Top me off, bro.

186
00:08:29,772 --> 00:08:31,372
So what happened?

187
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:34,409
I really don't want
to talk about this.

188
00:08:34,443 --> 00:08:36,678
Lighten up, Turtle.
If it's any consolation,

189
00:08:36,712 --> 00:08:38,913
this moonshine of yours
is starting to grow on me.

190
00:08:38,948 --> 00:08:40,949
- Great.
- Come on, tell us what happened.

191
00:08:40,983 --> 00:08:43,418
( Sighs ) I closed.

192
00:08:43,452 --> 00:08:45,587
I did.
I just didn't close well.

193
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:48,122
What, did you pop off early?
It's been a long time for you.

194
00:08:48,157 --> 00:08:49,958
Yeah, Turtle,
that's no big deal.

195
00:08:49,992 --> 00:08:52,327
No, it wasn't that.
It just didn't start out so good

196
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:54,262
and then I couldn't
find my groove.

197
00:08:54,296 --> 00:08:55,863
What, you didn't eat it right?

198
00:08:55,898 --> 00:08:58,433
- Disaster.
- I'm sure you're just imagining it.

199
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:01,536
No, I'm not. And the truth is I've
been imagining it for a month.

200
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,038
She is so hot and then finally

201
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:07,909
I was all ready and I made
my way down there and...

202
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:10,044
- What?
- Nothing.

203
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:12,247
- Something.
- You guys are gonna laugh at me.

204
00:09:12,281 --> 00:09:13,715
- No we won't.
- No no no.

205
00:09:13,749 --> 00:09:17,485
Okay, I made my way down
there just as the sun came up.

206
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,854
The harsh light hit it directly

207
00:09:19,888 --> 00:09:21,756
and it was completely
bald and I freaked.

208
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,225
<i>- ( Laughing )
- Yeah, see?</i>

209
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,894
I'm sorry.
Why did you freak?

210
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:28,730
Seriously, Turtle.
I love that.

211
00:09:28,764 --> 00:09:32,233
It's like you peel back the curtains
to reveal the mystery of oz.

212
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:33,868
I don't have a problem with it.

213
00:09:33,902 --> 00:09:36,604
It's just that close up
with the sun, it shocked me.

214
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:38,740
What, you saw
a shaved box before?

215
00:09:38,774 --> 00:09:41,075
I have in porn.
Just not in 3d.

216
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,078
I've been with girls who were
nicely groomed... landing strip.

217
00:09:44,113 --> 00:09:46,514
The landing strip went out
in the mid 90s, bro.

218
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:49,250
It's the truth.
Everyone goes smooth nowadays.

219
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:52,053
- Even you, I bet.
- Smooth balls for sure.

220
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:54,255
And I hope you do
yours as well.

221
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,624
- I don't groom my dick, no.
- Are you kidding?

222
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:58,793
It's 2010;
You'd better.

223
00:09:58,827 --> 00:10:01,663
- Do people really do this, Vin?
- I only know about my own dick.

224
00:10:01,697 --> 00:10:03,698
And, Turtle, you should
only worry about yours.

225
00:10:03,732 --> 00:10:06,367
But listen, you haven't been
with many chicks since Jamie.

226
00:10:06,402 --> 00:10:08,369
Many meaning zero.

227
00:10:08,404 --> 00:10:10,505
And you were nervous.
So I'm sure you did fine.

228
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:13,074
No, I didn't.
I need another shot.

229
00:10:13,108 --> 00:10:15,310
- Well, I am sure you will get one.
- I hope.

230
00:10:15,344 --> 00:10:18,446
Well, if you do, you'd better do
a little courtesy manscaping.

231
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,516
Can't have your dick
looking like a chia pet, bro.

232
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,252
( Laughs )

233
00:10:24,286 --> 00:10:27,188
Can I just get a little support?
At least tell me I'm not crazy.

234
00:10:27,222 --> 00:10:29,190
No, you're not crazy.
Murray's hard on you.

235
00:10:29,224 --> 00:10:31,426
People get into patterns
in work relationships.

236
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,861
Sometimes it's hard to get out of them.
You'll see with Ari and I.

237
00:10:33,896 --> 00:10:35,697
- Why? How's that go?
- Well, he's a dick.

238
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:37,799
- Better not be a dick to me.
- Take it easy.

239
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,968
Would it be so bad if I gave Ari gold
a smack in front of all his peers?

240
00:10:41,003 --> 00:10:43,004
Hey, Eric, and...

241
00:10:43,038 --> 00:10:44,572
- Scott.
- Scott.

242
00:10:44,606 --> 00:10:47,575
I told your office now is not a good time.
Ari is not in a great mood.

243
00:10:47,609 --> 00:10:50,144
- Has that whore called me back yet?
- Told you.

244
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:51,946
No, not yet.

245
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,015
- I'm gonna cheer him up, Jake.
- No, Eric, wait.

246
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:56,284
- Uh, Ari...
- Hey, Ari.

247
00:10:56,318 --> 00:10:58,286
What is this, the Big Brother
program of America?

248
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,254
- Except who's the Big Brother?
- This is Scott Lavin.

249
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:02,523
<i>- So? - I called you last
week twice about Vince.</i>

250
00:11:02,558 --> 00:11:05,426
What are you two doing in my office when
you don't have a meeting on the books?

251
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:07,729
- Is he kidding?
- We're here for Vince.

252
00:11:08,831 --> 00:11:10,331
Vince.
You remember Vince?

253
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:12,800
He doesn't play in the N.F.L.
but he still makes a good amount of money.

254
00:11:12,835 --> 00:11:16,270
Who the fuck are you and why am I
wasting my time listening to you?

255
00:11:16,305 --> 00:11:18,339
E, I got a lot on my plate.
Speak fast.

256
00:11:18,374 --> 00:11:19,774
We got a big offer for Vince.

257
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:22,543
Could be worth $100 million
over three movies.

258
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:25,046
- Look, now he's paying attention.
- Scott.

259
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:29,083
<i>- Randall Wallace?
- Scott: And Stan Lee.</i>

260
00:11:29,118 --> 00:11:31,886
- Why don't I know about this?
- 'Cause you don't call anybody back.

261
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,554
- I'll call Vince myself.
- Don't do that.

262
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:36,391
Truth is we got this done without you but
we obviously care about your opinion.

263
00:11:36,425 --> 00:11:39,694
Thank you, I appreciate it.
The truth is I've been a little under it lately.

264
00:11:39,728 --> 00:11:41,329
<i>- E: N.F.L.?
- Personal stuff.</i>

265
00:11:41,363 --> 00:11:43,030
Oh wow.
Everything okay with the family?

266
00:11:43,065 --> 00:11:44,766
<i>- Yeah, thanks.
- Amanda Daniels.</i>

267
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,768
<i>- I've got to take this.
- She's on her way up.</i>

268
00:11:46,802 --> 00:11:48,336
- She's on her way up?
- Uh-huh.

269
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,104
- What are you doing with Amanda?
- Nothing.

270
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:51,706
You hitting that?

271
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,709
Look, you guys got to go.
This is really important.

272
00:11:54,743 --> 00:11:56,811
I will call you as soon as I
go over this very thoroughly.

273
00:11:56,845 --> 00:11:59,947
- He is hitting that.
- Listen, e, I'll call you in an hour.

274
00:11:59,982 --> 00:12:03,651
Make sure that your dopplegang-banger
stays off the line. Go!

275
00:12:05,421 --> 00:12:07,622
- Hello, Amanda.
- Hello, Eric.

276
00:12:07,656 --> 00:12:10,858
- Get the fuck out. - Don't ever
touch me again, you fucking jerkoff.

277
00:12:10,893 --> 00:12:12,493
What are you
doing here, Amanda?

278
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:14,862
You called and I thought you
might threaten me to my face.

279
00:12:14,897 --> 00:12:17,765
- No one wants to threaten you, okay?
- Then what do you want?

280
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,301
I just simply want to know
if you really want to burn

281
00:12:20,335 --> 00:12:23,604
every last dollar that you have
trying to slander my name.

282
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,373
<i>- Slander?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

283
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:27,208
No, I read Lizzie's journals.

284
00:12:27,242 --> 00:12:29,644
There's some pretty horrific
stuff in there, even for you.

285
00:12:29,678 --> 00:12:32,847
- Why are you doing this? - Because once
upon a time you walked into my office

286
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:35,917
and you took a job away from me that
I deserved simply because you could.

287
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:39,153
- So it's about payback?
- No no, this is like arms control.

288
00:12:39,188 --> 00:12:43,391
See, you're like Iran and I need to take
away your weapons because you're reckless.

289
00:12:43,425 --> 00:12:45,426
You're smart enough to know
it's only a matter of time

290
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:47,862
before I scoop up one of your
castoffs and sue you right back.

291
00:12:47,896 --> 00:12:49,630
( Laughs ) Unlike you,

292
00:12:49,665 --> 00:12:51,999
I had the foresight
to work Lizzie for a while.

293
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:54,502
So I have proof,
you'd only have hearsay.

294
00:12:54,536 --> 00:12:57,772
Lizzie's little work-of-fiction
journal proves that I'm guilty

295
00:12:57,806 --> 00:13:01,209
like Lindsay "blow-han" proves
that fame is fucking healthy.

296
00:13:01,243 --> 00:13:03,978
( Laughs )
She has recordings of you too.

297
00:13:04,012 --> 00:13:05,646
<i>- Your voice.
- Bullshit.</i>

298
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:07,882
Oh, it's true.
The tapes are so clear

299
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,617
it sounds like they were
professionally recorded.

300
00:13:09,651 --> 00:13:11,486
<i>- You heard them?
- I listened to them, yeah,</i>

301
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,288
the last three nights and played
with myself while fantasizing

302
00:13:14,323 --> 00:13:16,991
about fucking you in the ass.

303
00:13:17,025 --> 00:13:19,560
Anything else you wanted to say?
I freed up my afternoon.

304
00:13:19,595 --> 00:13:22,697
You follow through on this
and you're starting a war.

305
00:13:22,731 --> 00:13:25,500
Then man up, Ari,
because I love to battle.

306
00:13:26,668 --> 00:13:28,202
( Laughs )
It's funny, you know.

307
00:13:28,237 --> 00:13:30,605
This was actually less
hostile than I expected.

308
00:13:35,143 --> 00:13:38,279
So Vince has been tweeting
the shit out of the Tequila.

309
00:13:38,313 --> 00:13:39,814
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

310
00:13:39,848 --> 00:13:42,583
- Said he started a new company.
- That's great.

311
00:13:42,618 --> 00:13:44,185
I was thinking of
posting some of the videos.

312
00:13:44,219 --> 00:13:47,288
- The cool ones, not the silly ones.
- Yeah.

313
00:13:47,322 --> 00:13:49,924
Totally.

314
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,926
How's your sandwich?

315
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,462
Good.

316
00:13:54,496 --> 00:13:55,763
Cool.

317
00:13:55,797 --> 00:13:57,331
Better than last night.

318
00:13:58,634 --> 00:14:00,735
- What?
- I'm kidding.

319
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:04,338
- No you weren't.
- Come on, it was awkward.

320
00:14:04,373 --> 00:14:07,775
<i>- You think? - I think maybe
we just did it too soon.</i>

321
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:10,077
Or maybe we shouldn't
have done it at all.

322
00:14:10,112 --> 00:14:11,846
No no no, of course
we should have done it.

323
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,180
It was my fault.
It was me.

324
00:14:13,215 --> 00:14:15,016
- I take full responsibility.
- For what?

325
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,552
- For the awkwardness.
- What happened?

326
00:14:17,586 --> 00:14:20,721
We were having a great time and then
the second the clothes came off

327
00:14:20,756 --> 00:14:23,357
you turned into a clumsy mute.

328
00:14:23,392 --> 00:14:25,026
I wasn't feeling great.

329
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,361
<i>I don't know, Turtle.
Maybe we're just not meant to be like that.</i>

330
00:14:27,396 --> 00:14:30,298
I mean, Sasha said she had the best
sex of her life on our Tequila.

331
00:14:30,332 --> 00:14:32,033
I thought it was the worst.

332
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:34,468
It wasn't the worst.

333
00:14:34,503 --> 00:14:36,771
Okay, you've got to give
me another shot.

334
00:14:36,805 --> 00:14:39,006
Maybe we're just meant
to be business partners.

335
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,776
No no no, come on.
I will wine you and dine you

336
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,378
and woo you and I will
blow your mind in bed.

337
00:14:44,413 --> 00:14:46,047
You think?

338
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:48,149
Let me try.

339
00:14:48,183 --> 00:14:49,817
Okay.

340
00:14:49,851 --> 00:14:51,752
You can try.

341
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:54,889
Excuse me.
Can I have some ketchup, please?

342
00:15:01,697 --> 00:15:03,497
- Hello.
- Hi.

343
00:15:03,532 --> 00:15:05,967
Hi, I'm William Walsh.
I'm an old friend of Vince's.

344
00:15:06,001 --> 00:15:08,202
I'm Sasha,
a new friend of Vince's.

345
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:10,404
Billy Walsh.
Oh my God.

346
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:12,707
Vince, how are you?
It's been awhile.

347
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:14,609
I'll say. Come here.
How are you?

348
00:15:14,643 --> 00:15:17,678
- I'm okay.
- Hey, sash, this is Billy Walsh,

349
00:15:17,713 --> 00:15:19,680
- an amazing filmmaker.
- That's kind of you to say.

350
00:15:19,715 --> 00:15:22,183
I thought you looked
familiar, but different.

351
00:15:22,217 --> 00:15:23,951
I've been through
a lot and back again.

352
00:15:23,986 --> 00:15:25,653
- Can I come in?
- Of course, of course.

353
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:29,390
Hey, Johnny, look who's here.

354
00:15:29,424 --> 00:15:32,393
Jeez, Billy Walsh.
It's like a mirage.

355
00:15:32,427 --> 00:15:35,696
- How are you, Drama?
- Peachy, Billy.

356
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:37,565
I'm getting jerked off
by the network

357
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:39,967
'cause nobody can find
a idea for me.

358
00:15:40,002 --> 00:15:41,535
You got one?

359
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,471
Not off the top of my head, no.

360
00:15:43,505 --> 00:15:45,306
Superb.

361
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,741
You seem angry, Drama.

362
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:49,577
I've always been, Billy.
Only now I'm drunk too.

363
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:52,680
- I shot a movie with you.
- Yeah, uh...

364
00:15:52,714 --> 00:15:55,516
You know, maybe this wasn't
the best place for me to come.

365
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,319
Porn stars, alcohol,
manic depressives...

366
00:15:58,353 --> 00:16:02,123
I've avoided all temptation
for the last 24 months now.

367
00:16:02,157 --> 00:16:03,691
So what are you
doing here, Billy?

368
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:06,560
I came to get back into
the business I left behind.

369
00:16:06,595 --> 00:16:10,197
Vince isn't gonna make another stinker with
you, Billy, if that's what you're thinking.

370
00:16:10,232 --> 00:16:14,468
- No, Vince isn't what I need at this point.
- So what do you need?

371
00:16:14,503 --> 00:16:16,337
E.

372
00:16:19,741 --> 00:16:21,409
Vince needs to get rid of Ari.

373
00:16:21,443 --> 00:16:24,445
- Enough already.
- I'm being serious.

374
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:26,914
I mean, the guy is barely
even in the business anymore.

375
00:16:26,948 --> 00:16:30,051
What do you think is gonna happen when
he's standing on an N.F.L. sideline

376
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:32,319
spending all his time
trying to bang cheerleaders?

377
00:16:32,354 --> 00:16:34,455
Look, Ari's got a big mouth
but he's done a lot by us.

378
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:36,490
And he's obviously got
some serious stuff going on.

379
00:16:36,525 --> 00:16:38,959
So does Vince and he needs someone
who's gonna be on the ball.

380
00:16:38,994 --> 00:16:40,828
Are you telling me
you can't handle an offer?

381
00:16:40,862 --> 00:16:43,664
You can't make sure he's paid?
Make sure he has a nice trailer?

382
00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:46,067
Ari and Vince's attorneys
handle the little details.

383
00:16:46,101 --> 00:16:49,170
We can take it to his attorney.
We can handle the details.

384
00:16:49,204 --> 00:16:52,506
If Ari's so stressed out maybe he'd
appreciate you taking the reins on this one.

385
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,742
Come on, aren't you tired
of being a pushover?

386
00:16:54,776 --> 00:16:56,544
- Who's a pushover?
- We both are.

387
00:16:56,578 --> 00:16:57,978
We handled
this thing for Vince.

388
00:16:58,013 --> 00:16:59,714
We're basically the ones
keeping this company afloat.

389
00:16:59,748 --> 00:17:02,149
- So now you're back to Murray?
- Of course I'm back to Murray.

390
00:17:02,184 --> 00:17:05,086
We do all the work.
I mean, the guy is literally never here.

391
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,221
- I wouldn't say never.
- You wouldn't say never?

392
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:10,291
Murray!
Hey, Murray!

393
00:17:10,325 --> 00:17:12,793
- Anyone seen Murray, ever?
- Are you on drugs?

394
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:15,262
No, I'm fucking angry,
as you should be too.

395
00:17:15,297 --> 00:17:17,364
- About what, Murray or Ari?
- About both of them.

396
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:20,634
They are checking out, okay?
We cannot.

397
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:22,603
This is our future, all right?

398
00:17:22,637 --> 00:17:24,405
You saw how we handled
this deal with Vince.

399
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:26,207
You saw how we handled Ari.

400
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:28,743
We can run Vince and this company
without either one of them.

401
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:31,178
You do realize that I'm marrying
Murray's god-daughter, right?

402
00:17:31,213 --> 00:17:34,248
- The one who got me this job.
- Family before business, I get it.

403
00:17:34,282 --> 00:17:37,184
But you and Sloan are about to start
your own family so you need to start...

404
00:17:37,219 --> 00:17:40,020
- shauna's on the phone and she's
freaking out. - Who isn't?

405
00:17:40,055 --> 00:17:42,857
She says that Vince tweeted that
he started some Tequila company

406
00:17:42,891 --> 00:17:44,992
and Turtle posted some
racy videos about it.

407
00:17:45,026 --> 00:17:47,361
Awesome.

408
00:17:56,204 --> 00:17:59,507
No, I did not know that Vince
was dating a porn star, shauna.

409
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:04,411
No, I didn't know he started
his own tequila company either.

410
00:18:04,446 --> 00:18:06,280
I have to go.

411
00:18:06,314 --> 00:18:09,917
Lizzie Grant.
I didn't know that you ate here.

412
00:18:09,951 --> 00:18:11,552
Well, I know you don't eat here

413
00:18:11,586 --> 00:18:13,587
'cause you don't like,
and I'm quoting,

414
00:18:13,622 --> 00:18:15,823
"eating with all
the pussy-ass bitch agents."

415
00:18:15,857 --> 00:18:18,692
You know what?
I have grown to love my own kind.

416
00:18:18,727 --> 00:18:20,628
- Are you following me?
- You can't prove it.

417
00:18:20,662 --> 00:18:23,531
You would be amazed
at what I could prove.

418
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:25,499
- I talked to your boss.
- I'm aware.

419
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:28,536
Yeah, she may use nicer words but
she's a much worse person than me.

420
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,604
Anyone in this town
could tell you that.

421
00:18:30,639 --> 00:18:32,706
That is so funny
because she swears

422
00:18:32,741 --> 00:18:35,075
you're the worst person
she's ever dealt with.

423
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,912
- Stealing clients...
- Have you ever seen me steal clients?

424
00:18:37,946 --> 00:18:40,014
Ari, I have no interest
in talking to you.

425
00:18:40,048 --> 00:18:43,517
Well, I have an interest
in you not sullying my name.

426
00:18:43,552 --> 00:18:45,786
So tell me what you want.

427
00:18:45,821 --> 00:18:48,289
- What I want?
- Yes.

428
00:18:48,323 --> 00:18:50,491
How much money to settle

429
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:53,160
so we don't end up in court
where you will lose?

430
00:18:53,195 --> 00:18:57,364
A writer's assistant on a sitcom
once sued for inappropriate talk.

431
00:18:57,399 --> 00:18:59,934
It went to the supreme court.
You know what they told her?

432
00:18:59,968 --> 00:19:03,437
They told her that the writers
can talk about gang-banging her

433
00:19:03,471 --> 00:19:05,940
all day long as long
as they don't do it.

434
00:19:05,974 --> 00:19:07,908
I know the case.
They're creative.

435
00:19:07,943 --> 00:19:10,945
You're certainly not.
So you can talk about gang-banging all day,

436
00:19:10,979 --> 00:19:13,013
but you're the only one
who's gonna get fucked.

437
00:19:13,048 --> 00:19:14,548
- 100,000.
- No.

438
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,283
- 250.
- How about 10 million?

439
00:19:16,318 --> 00:19:19,486
- Don't be absurd.
- You think I'm being absurd?

440
00:19:19,521 --> 00:19:21,789
I think that you're
whoring yourself out

441
00:19:21,823 --> 00:19:23,824
to a witch of a woman
who is trying to get you

442
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:26,894
- to slander a good family man's name.
- ( Laughs )

443
00:19:26,928 --> 00:19:29,096
$1 million not to sue.

444
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,465
Ari, I cannot tell you

445
00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:34,001
how good it makes me feel
to watch you squirm.

446
00:19:34,035 --> 00:19:36,704
But you can rest easy, 'cause
I've already told Amanda

447
00:19:36,738 --> 00:19:38,706
that I'm not gonna sue you.
So keep your money.

448
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,674
- You're not?
- No.

449
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:44,411
I will make my money because
I'm smart and I'm talented,

450
00:19:44,446 --> 00:19:46,213
not because you're repugnant.

451
00:19:46,248 --> 00:19:48,449
I think you're doing
the right thing,

452
00:19:48,483 --> 00:19:50,651
because no one needs
to hear about our past.

453
00:19:50,685 --> 00:19:52,119
No, that's where you're wrong.

454
00:19:52,153 --> 00:19:54,255
Everyone needs to hear.

455
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:57,124
I want the women of the world
to know how you treat them.

456
00:19:57,158 --> 00:19:59,059
What does that mean?

457
00:19:59,094 --> 00:20:00,494
Check "deadline Hollywood."

458
00:20:00,528 --> 00:20:02,563
I'm sure the story should
be posted sometime soon,

459
00:20:02,597 --> 00:20:04,164
unless you can buy them off.

460
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:07,234
You sent tapes of me
to "deadline Hollywood"?

461
00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:08,769
Is that even legal?

462
00:20:08,803 --> 00:20:10,971
Sue me.

463
00:20:15,477 --> 00:20:17,244
( Grunts )

464
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,480
I thought you wanted
to conserve your product.

465
00:20:19,514 --> 00:20:21,749
- I want to relax.
- You freaking about tonight?

466
00:20:21,783 --> 00:20:24,218
I'm not freaking,
I'm just on edge a little.

467
00:20:24,252 --> 00:20:27,121
Let me tell you, shoving that poison
down your throat is not the remedy.

468
00:20:27,155 --> 00:20:29,957
Poison?
This is 100% pure agave.

469
00:20:29,991 --> 00:20:33,127
The only remedy for you is
storming the hairless beaches.

470
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:34,929
You're gonna be fine, Turtle.

471
00:20:34,963 --> 00:20:36,397
I don't normally have
performance issues.

472
00:20:36,431 --> 00:20:38,465
Yeah, you perform
as often as led zeppelin.

473
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,801
You should probably take a cab.
Or I can drive you.

474
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:42,036
You should take a cab.

475
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,505
I like you two as my parents.

476
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:47,074
<i>- Hey, Vin, where's the can?
- To the left.</i>

477
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:49,610
Yo, Turtle, you want a Cialis?

478
00:20:49,644 --> 00:20:51,645
No.
Maybe.

479
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,948
Hi, I need a cab
for 3750 longo.

480
00:20:53,982 --> 00:20:55,916
Johnny, why do you
carry around Cialis?

481
00:20:55,951 --> 00:20:58,052
In case I really
got to bury one.

482
00:20:58,086 --> 00:21:01,155
- You should use kaboom.
You get a bigger bang. - Good tip.

483
00:21:01,189 --> 00:21:03,624
E, to what do we owe
this pleasure?

484
00:21:03,658 --> 00:21:05,960
Turtle posted a video
of you and Sasha on Twitter.

485
00:21:05,994 --> 00:21:07,728
I just got
reamed out by shauna.

486
00:21:07,762 --> 00:21:10,097
That was unintentional.
I edited smaller parts.

487
00:21:10,131 --> 00:21:12,633
- I just accidentally uploaded the whole thing.
- I thought it was cute.

488
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,568
A movie star telling guys
to fuck like him

489
00:21:14,602 --> 00:21:16,870
and girls to fuck like
a porn star isn't cute, Vince.

490
00:21:16,905 --> 00:21:18,439
<i>- I said that?
- Yes.</i>

491
00:21:18,473 --> 00:21:20,941
- You did. - I'm sure the way
I said it was very charming.

492
00:21:20,976 --> 00:21:23,978
Turtle, what happened? I thought the Tequila
company was gonna be on the down low.

493
00:21:24,012 --> 00:21:25,713
No, it only went out
to my Twitter followers.

494
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:27,848
- You have a million and a
half followers. - I do?

495
00:21:27,882 --> 00:21:30,084
Yeah, now t.M.Z.,
Perez Hilton

496
00:21:30,118 --> 00:21:32,186
and just Jared all want to know
if Sasha's your girlfriend.

497
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,787
Well, tell them she is.

498
00:21:33,822 --> 00:21:36,090
I thought we were
just really good friends.

499
00:21:36,124 --> 00:21:38,659
Look, Vince, you just got the biggest
offer of your career today, all right?

500
00:21:38,693 --> 00:21:40,961
- I just want to make sure you're focused.
- I'm focused.

501
00:21:40,996 --> 00:21:43,464
- I'm focused. Aren't I focused?
- Seems focused to me.

502
00:21:43,498 --> 00:21:46,000
You see? So how was the offer?
Was it good?

503
00:21:46,034 --> 00:21:48,435
Yeah, it's great.
Ari's looking it over right now.

504
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,337
All right.
Well, things are happening.

505
00:21:50,372 --> 00:21:53,340
No kidding. Check out this b.
B.M. I got today.

506
00:21:55,043 --> 00:21:58,112
E, I've tried you several
times at the office.

507
00:21:58,146 --> 00:22:01,682
I would love it if you could see yourself
giving me five minutes of your time.

508
00:22:01,716 --> 00:22:03,851
- Technology is amazing.
- What's amazing

509
00:22:03,885 --> 00:22:06,220
is that somebody gave this clown my b.
B.M. Address.

510
00:22:06,254 --> 00:22:08,389
Hey, suit.
Long time.

511
00:22:08,423 --> 00:22:11,125
( Growls )

512
00:22:14,095 --> 00:22:17,531
Do you want Jerry Jones?

513
00:22:17,565 --> 00:22:20,434
And you still haven't
called back Jeff Katzenberg

514
00:22:20,468 --> 00:22:22,169
or Mike Meldman
or Tracy Morgan.

515
00:22:22,203 --> 00:22:24,838
I don't want to talk to anybody.
Was I not clear?

516
00:22:24,873 --> 00:22:27,341
Nobody! I don't care if
Justin Bieber calls

517
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:30,477
and wants me to negotiate
the rights to his virginity.

518
00:22:30,512 --> 00:22:33,047
I don't want to talk to him.
Nobody!

519
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:37,017
Uh, your wife is here.

520
00:22:37,052 --> 00:22:39,787
- Hello, Mrs. gold.
Ari doesn't wish to speak... - Hello.

521
00:22:39,821 --> 00:22:41,755
- Get the fuck out of the way.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

522
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:44,458
- You shouldn't talk to your assistants like that.
- I know, I'm sorry.

523
00:22:44,492 --> 00:22:46,794
- What are you doing here?
- I told you I was coming by with the swatches

524
00:22:46,828 --> 00:22:48,228
so that we could
redo your office.

525
00:22:48,263 --> 00:22:49,763
- Oh.
- You forgot.

526
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:52,066
- No, I... - Okay, what do
you think of this one?

527
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,168
- Like it.
- You didn't even look.

528
00:22:54,202 --> 00:22:55,536
No no, I glanced.

529
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,938
Baby, I got quick eyeballs.
U know that.

530
00:22:57,972 --> 00:22:59,973
And I trust your taste.
You have amazing taste.

531
00:23:00,008 --> 00:23:02,676
- And I love that.
- I'd like you to be involved.

532
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,145
- Why? - It would give us something
that we could do together.

533
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,181
Something we could do...
we do everything together.

534
00:23:07,215 --> 00:23:10,084
<i>- No, not anymore we don't.
- What do you mean?</i>

535
00:23:10,118 --> 00:23:13,153
- Since the merger.
- What since the merger?

536
00:23:13,188 --> 00:23:15,322
<i>- I don't feel good.
- Why?</i>

537
00:23:15,356 --> 00:23:18,692
Because you're never home.
Now with this N.F.L. thing...

538
00:23:18,726 --> 00:23:20,727
- that may not happen.
- Why not?

539
00:23:20,762 --> 00:23:22,963
- It may not happen.
- Why not? What's happening?

540
00:23:22,997 --> 00:23:24,598
Nothing.

541
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:27,167
I feel like you've been keeping
a lot of secrets lately.

542
00:23:27,202 --> 00:23:30,337
Honey, no. Listen,
let's go to an early dinner,

543
00:23:30,371 --> 00:23:33,006
just the two of us.
We'll talk about everything. All right?

544
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,843
I'm sorry, Ari. Dana Gordon's on the line.
Says it's urgent about Vince.

545
00:23:35,877 --> 00:23:37,845
I'll call you in an hour,
take you to Madeo.

546
00:23:37,879 --> 00:23:40,180
- Just you and me, okay?
- Okay.

547
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,418
- Put her through.
- ( Phone rings )

548
00:23:44,452 --> 00:23:46,653
Dana, is this really important?

549
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:50,023
If Vince is really gonna carry this
studio's next franchise, I'd say it is.

550
00:23:51,626 --> 00:23:53,527
- ( Moans )
- Does that feel good?

551
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:55,596
Amazing.

552
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,598
- I told you I could do this.
- Yeah you can.

553
00:23:57,632 --> 00:24:00,467
- You're incredible.
- Shh.

554
00:24:02,403 --> 00:24:04,204
Sorry if I caused you
any stress.

555
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:05,639
It's okay.

556
00:24:05,673 --> 00:24:07,508
I just thought
it was your first time.

557
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:09,042
First time what?

558
00:24:09,077 --> 00:24:11,311
You know, having sex.

559
00:24:11,346 --> 00:24:13,547
Are you serious?

560
00:24:13,581 --> 00:24:16,416
- It's okay if it was.
- I'm 30.

561
00:24:16,451 --> 00:24:18,352
I'm just saying.

562
00:24:18,386 --> 00:24:21,088
You really think
I'm some ugly loser, huh?

563
00:24:21,122 --> 00:24:23,757
- I didn't say that.
- No, but the first time I tried to kiss you

564
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:26,960
you looked at me like I was a
venereal disease. I'm cute.

565
00:24:26,995 --> 00:24:29,463
You are, Turtle,
and I didn't see it at first.

566
00:24:29,497 --> 00:24:31,732
- But I see it now.
- Good.

567
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:34,101
But something was up
last night.

568
00:24:34,135 --> 00:24:36,904
- Just let it go.
- Was it me?

569
00:24:36,938 --> 00:24:38,572
No no, are you crazy?

570
00:24:38,606 --> 00:24:41,742
- Just tell me what it was.
- I'm immature.

571
00:24:41,776 --> 00:24:44,077
What do you mean?

572
00:24:44,112 --> 00:24:46,079
I've never been
with a girl before

573
00:24:46,114 --> 00:24:49,650
who was totally shaved
down there.

574
00:24:49,684 --> 00:24:51,618
- It freaked me out.
- Wow.

575
00:24:51,653 --> 00:24:53,320
- Yeah.
- You are immature.

576
00:24:53,354 --> 00:24:55,622
I know. I had dreams all
night about playing pac-man.

577
00:24:55,657 --> 00:24:58,725
- Pac-man?
- You know, pac-man.

578
00:25:00,361 --> 00:25:03,497
Oh my God.
Is that why you shaved too?

579
00:25:03,531 --> 00:25:05,399
Yeah, why?
You don't like it?

580
00:25:05,433 --> 00:25:08,068
( Laughs ) No, I don't like it.

581
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:11,572
Guys are supposed to trim,
not go totally bald.

582
00:25:11,606 --> 00:25:14,841
Thanks, Drama. So did I totally
just fuck this up again?

583
00:25:14,876 --> 00:25:17,311
No, it'll grow back.

584
00:25:20,848 --> 00:25:23,083
I really appreciate you taking
the time to meet with me.

585
00:25:23,117 --> 00:25:24,885
I didn't have
much choice, Billy.

586
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:27,087
We all have choices
and I've made some bad ones.

587
00:25:27,121 --> 00:25:29,256
Yeah. What can I do
for you, Billy?

588
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:32,759
I need you to help guide me out
of the toilet like you did Vince.

589
00:25:32,794 --> 00:25:36,663
- Why would you want me? - Because, man,
you were the first guy to believe in me.

590
00:25:36,698 --> 00:25:38,699
You found my first script,
you got me Vince,

591
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:41,635
you got us the money.
And as much as I was hard on you,

592
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:43,971
I always knew you were
the guy with the good eye.

593
00:25:44,005 --> 00:25:46,640
- We can't work together, Billy.
- Why not?

594
00:25:46,674 --> 00:25:49,610
Because there's too much
baggage and past.

595
00:25:49,644 --> 00:25:52,379
- Pretend we've never met.
- How could I do that?

596
00:25:52,413 --> 00:25:54,681
Well, essentially we haven't.
I don't drink anymore.

597
00:25:54,716 --> 00:25:56,817
- I don't do drugs. I don't curse.
- You don't curse?

598
00:25:56,851 --> 00:25:58,685
No, I've spent
the last three years

599
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,021
becoming an ordained
minister in Santa fe.

600
00:26:01,055 --> 00:26:04,157
Got myself right
and I want to work.

601
00:26:04,192 --> 00:26:06,126
You want Vince?

602
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,694
I want you to help me.

603
00:26:07,729 --> 00:26:10,797
I'll do anything...
commercials, tv, anything.

604
00:26:10,832 --> 00:26:12,366
I've changed.

605
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,202
Still got that Pablo Escobar
tattoo on your back?

606
00:26:15,236 --> 00:26:17,104
No, I had it scraped off
with a bowie knife

607
00:26:17,138 --> 00:26:19,206
in a ritual
smokehouse ceremony.

608
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,210
No, it's still there.
Some things haven't changed.

609
00:26:23,244 --> 00:26:25,412
- But I've got a family now.
- Oh, you have a kid?

610
00:26:25,446 --> 00:26:28,382
- I've got four.
- Four?

611
00:26:28,416 --> 00:26:30,517
Set of Irish twins,
set of actual twins

612
00:26:30,551 --> 00:26:32,219
and another one on the way.

613
00:26:32,253 --> 00:26:34,221
I thought we could
live on love,

614
00:26:34,255 --> 00:26:36,757
but tiny kids can't eat love.

615
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,695
( Sighs ) Look, Billy, I'm gonna
have to think about this.

616
00:26:41,729 --> 00:26:44,531
You know, Drama was telling me about
this network deal that he's got.

617
00:26:44,565 --> 00:26:47,200
Yeah, if you have any ideas, don't
be afraid to shoot them my way.

618
00:26:47,235 --> 00:26:49,703
Actually, I was already thinking
like maybe he's not having any luck

619
00:26:49,737 --> 00:26:51,738
because he's too ugly
to star in his own show.

620
00:26:51,773 --> 00:26:54,875
- Yeah, you've changed, Billy.
- Come on, don't be mad. I'm serious.

621
00:26:54,909 --> 00:26:57,778
Look, he doesn't have the face for
the screen but he's got the voice.

622
00:26:57,812 --> 00:27:00,514
- So what, you think he should do radio?
- No, I was thinking a cartoon.

623
00:27:00,548 --> 00:27:04,217
- Cartoon? - Yeah, like
"the simpsons" but angrier.

624
00:27:04,252 --> 00:27:07,120
E, Ari's here
and he's being a douche.

625
00:27:07,155 --> 00:27:09,923
You hear that voice?
How distinct and angry it is?

626
00:27:09,957 --> 00:27:11,458
Were you talking about me?

627
00:27:11,492 --> 00:27:13,694
- What's Ari want, Drama?
- He wants to talk to you.

628
00:27:13,728 --> 00:27:16,997
- I got a lot of ideas.
- Sit tight, Billy.

629
00:27:17,031 --> 00:27:19,933
Jesus, Billy, you're back and
apparently working at the gap.

630
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:21,802
<i>- Hey, Ari.
- He needs representation, Ari.</i>

631
00:27:21,836 --> 00:27:26,006
- So does Vince. - Yes, he does.
Did you decide to start doing your job again?

632
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,775
I close my eyes for one minute
and he's dating porn stars

633
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,977
- and starting a Tequila company?
- Look, Ari...

634
00:27:31,012 --> 00:27:33,347
you look. I need to talk to him.
My wife's in the car.

635
00:27:33,381 --> 00:27:35,382
She's ready to shoot me
so I've got to talk fast.

636
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:37,718
- I already spoke to shauna.
- Well, I talked to Dana

637
00:27:37,752 --> 00:27:39,820
and the director
and they're freaking out.

638
00:27:39,854 --> 00:27:43,590
How could you let this guy show up drunk
and with a porn star to a meeting?

639
00:27:43,624 --> 00:27:45,892
He took a Vicodin, Ari.
And I didn't let him.

640
00:27:45,927 --> 00:27:47,728
- How is he doing now?
- He's fine.

641
00:27:47,762 --> 00:27:49,963
The studio wants to sit down with
him to make sure that he is.

642
00:27:49,997 --> 00:27:51,431
Jesus.

643
00:27:51,466 --> 00:27:54,134
Look, is this thing real, the
relationship with the porn star?

644
00:27:54,168 --> 00:27:56,303
- What? No.
- You sure?

645
00:27:56,337 --> 00:27:58,772
Ari, Vince is fine.

646
00:27:58,806 --> 00:28:01,608
- Where is he? I want to talk to him.
