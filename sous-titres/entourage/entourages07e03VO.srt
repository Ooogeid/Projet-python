- Turtle: Where's Vince?
- E: No clue.

17
00:01:21,655 --> 00:01:23,923
He'd better hurry, I've got to meet
my accountant in an hour.

18
00:01:23,957 --> 00:01:25,590
You mean Vince's accountant.

19
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:27,191
- I pay him.
- Yeah, on layaway.

20
00:01:27,226 --> 00:01:29,326
( Laughs ) Good one, E.

21
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,994
It's a sad day when you're
jealous of my success, Drama.

22
00:01:32,029 --> 00:01:34,829
Your definition of success
and mine are way different.

23
00:01:34,863 --> 00:01:37,130
Yeah, I have my own company,
you have nothing.

24
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:39,298
- He's got me.
- Damn straight, player.

25
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,299
I don't like you two as a team.

26
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:44,300
Get used to it 'cause this team
is going places.

27
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:47,402
Yo yo.

28
00:01:47,436 --> 00:01:49,536
Great mother of God.

29
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:51,437
E: You bought a motorcycle.

30
00:01:51,472 --> 00:01:54,640
Don't worry, E. Made sure
to get one with airbags.

31
00:01:54,675 --> 00:01:56,508
- Hilarious.
- So what's up? Are we eating?

32
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:58,509
We're done. We waited an hour.
I've got Marvin.

33
00:01:58,544 --> 00:02:00,844
<i>I'm sorry. I didn't know how long
it was going to take at the dealer.</i>

34
00:02:00,878 --> 00:02:02,945
Anyway, what are
you guys gonna do?

35
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:05,980
- Office.
- We have a meeting with
an emmy-winning writer.

36
00:02:06,014 --> 00:02:08,748
Oh well, hop on, E.
I'll give you a ride.

37
00:02:08,782 --> 00:02:10,949
I want to show your boy
Lavin my bike anyway.

38
00:02:10,984 --> 00:02:12,918
- He's not my boy.
- Whatever. Hop on.

39
00:02:12,952 --> 00:02:15,986
No, I'm not sitting on that
weird little seat wrapping
my arms around you.

40
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,320
- All right. Johnny, you want to race?
- No.

41
00:02:18,354 --> 00:02:20,188
Come on, remember
when we were kids?

42
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:23,557
- We used to race to the market
and play street fighter.
- We were on schwinns, bro.

43
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:26,726
Think about how much more fun
this will be. Don't be a pussy.

44
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,426
I'll see you there.

45
00:02:28,461 --> 00:02:30,027
- Come on, E.
- We're not racing.

46
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:31,461
- Come on!
- Yes we are!

47
00:02:31,496 --> 00:02:32,695
Be careful.
Drive slow.

48
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,597
Can't be careful.
We're racing.

49
00:02:39,134 --> 00:02:41,501
( Tires squeal )

50
00:02:42,737 --> 00:02:45,504
Why are you taking me
to school today, daddy?

51
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:49,040
Because I want to take
some of the load off mommy.
You know how hard she works.

52
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:50,941
- Must have done something wrong.
- No.

53
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:53,609
- What did you do, daddy?
- I didn't do anything.

54
00:02:53,643 --> 00:02:55,209
Hey, baby.

55
00:02:55,244 --> 00:02:57,710
<i>- Told you. You did something.
- Jonah: She's right.</i>

56
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,912
Honey, tell them
that we're all good.

57
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,613
- What do you guys want for breakfast?
- French toast.

58
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:06,215
Okay, so who's come up with
a name for our football team?

59
00:03:06,249 --> 00:03:08,583
I think everyone's a little sick
of talking about this, Ari.

60
00:03:08,618 --> 00:03:10,818
<i>This family is going to own
an N.F.L. team, all right?</i>

61
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:12,653
<i>We're gonna talk
about it 24 hours a day.</i>

62
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:15,455
You kept your son up all night long
talking about this.

63
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,090
- Look at him. He's falling asleep.
- Just kidding.

64
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:19,725
- ( Ari laughs )
- Do you know what?

65
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,027
I will have breakfast ready as soon
as you get ready for school.

66
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:23,929
Your father's taking you
for the first time this year

67
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:25,697
and I'd like you to be on time.

68
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:27,365
You want me to get him, mom?

69
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:29,634
No no no, jews don't carry guns, buddy.
You know that.

70
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:33,737
- The Jewish army does.
- Excuse me! Could you please
get ready for school?

71
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:37,774
- Can you give us one second, honey?
- Okay.

72
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,844
What are you so upset about?

73
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,545
- What am I so upset about?
- Yeah.

74
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,647
The slut that ruined
your best friend's career

75
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:47,681
and marriage is still
working in your office.

76
00:03:47,716 --> 00:03:49,582
And if that wasn't enough,
for some reason

77
00:03:49,617 --> 00:03:52,518
you were spinning her around like
you'd just won "dancing with the stars."

78
00:03:52,552 --> 00:03:54,753
- No, I...
- Why were you spinning her around?

79
00:03:54,788 --> 00:03:57,889
Because I had just got the call from
the N.F.L. and I was excited.

80
00:03:57,924 --> 00:04:00,292
I have dreamt since I was a kid

81
00:04:00,326 --> 00:04:01,993
about owning a football team.

82
00:04:02,028 --> 00:04:04,162
I would have spun Lloyd around

83
00:04:04,196 --> 00:04:06,430
if he was in front of me.
And if I could lift him.

84
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:09,333
I don't like that girl, Ari.
I don't like her one bit.

85
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:11,935
And I still don't understand
why you didn't fire her last year.

86
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:14,270
If I was gonna fire anyone,
it should have been Andrew.

87
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:17,039
You know what? Maybe
you should have fired them both.

88
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:25,546
Oh!

89
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,114
- This is badass.
- You like?

90
00:04:27,148 --> 00:04:29,082
- Yes.
- I fucking love it.

91
00:04:29,116 --> 00:04:31,449
E must be losing his mind.

92
00:04:31,484 --> 00:04:34,119
I told him the good news is you get
into an accident on a bike,

93
00:04:34,153 --> 00:04:37,621
- you don't break legs. Usually you just die.
- Hey, I've got a '60 Panhead.

94
00:04:37,655 --> 00:04:40,691
- We should go for a putt
this weekend, the rock store.
- That'd be great.

95
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:43,126
- Hey, want to take it for a spin right now?
- I would love to.

96
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,694
I've got to go to this auction
and buy some wine for a client.

97
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:47,996
<i>- You do that for your clients?
- I'd like to have you believe that,</i>

98
00:04:48,031 --> 00:04:51,900
but Murray is playing golf
with Sean Connery in Scotland.

99
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:53,969
So it falls on me to do
all his bitch work.

100
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:56,471
You should hear some of the things
I made E do over the years.

101
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,673
I'd very much enjoy that.
Truth be told,

102
00:04:58,707 --> 00:05:01,241
I'd suck herpes out
of a girl's ass for you.

103
00:05:01,276 --> 00:05:03,376
- I got beef with Murray.
- Never met him.

104
00:05:03,411 --> 00:05:05,178
No, why would you?
He's never here.

105
00:05:05,212 --> 00:05:08,580
- Hence the empty parking spot.
- They got other things at this auction?

106
00:05:08,614 --> 00:05:10,749
They got art, coins, all kinds of shit.

107
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,017
- Perfect, I'll roll with.
- All right.

108
00:05:13,052 --> 00:05:14,619
Pick up some things
for the house.

109
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:17,287
Or maybe I'll just raise
the bidding on Connery's wine.

110
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:19,256
I like it. Force him out of retirement.

111
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,857
Actually pull in some commissions.

112
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:23,193
Pull around,
I'll see you in a second.

113
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:30,532
So, I won my first two Emmys

114
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:33,835
for "The days and nights
of Molly Dodd" in '87-'88.

115
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:36,337
<i>I won my third for
"The famous Teddy Z" in '89</i>

116
00:05:36,372 --> 00:05:40,674
and then in '91 was my fourth
and final one for "Designing women."

117
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:41,875
All before the age of 30.

118
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,844
No wins after '91?

119
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:47,046
To tell you the truth, I haven't
had a produced script since '91.

120
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:50,616
Roger made so much money
in the '80s that in 1991,

121
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,417
much to his first Agent
Ari Gold's chagrin,

122
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:56,286
- he decided to retire young.
- And now you're unretiring?

123
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:59,055
Roger lost a lot of money
in the market the last couple of years.

124
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:01,824
And my stay-at-home
husband took a lot more.

125
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:04,593
So you're just getting back
into the business for money?

126
00:06:04,628 --> 00:06:06,795
I was hoping whoever
was going to write my show

127
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:09,497
<i>- was going to be excited to work for me.
- Work for you?</i>

128
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:12,066
Johnny, Roger is very excited.

129
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,101
Not to work for you,
but to work with you.

130
00:06:14,135 --> 00:06:16,437
- Right, Roger?
- I'm exuberant.

131
00:06:16,471 --> 00:06:17,971
So what's this show about?

132
00:06:18,006 --> 00:06:20,740
It's about two brothers who work
at the four seasons Maui.

133
00:06:20,775 --> 00:06:22,675
- You ever been there?
- No.

134
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,143
It's incredible.

135
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:26,579
So this show is just
an excuse to live in Maui?

136
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:28,546
And what would be
so wrong with that?

137
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:30,248
Yeah, don't worry about that, Drama.

138
00:06:30,282 --> 00:06:33,384
<i>- Yeah, Johnny. You're gonna love Maui.
- I do love Maui.</i>

139
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,253
I'm just concerned about
what the show is going to be.

140
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,021
I'm just concerned
you've only done sitcoms.

141
00:06:38,056 --> 00:06:40,189
Mostly multi-camera work.
Have you ever done any dramas?

142
00:06:40,224 --> 00:06:43,558
- I don't do dramas.
- And I don't do comedy. I'm not funny.

143
00:06:43,593 --> 00:06:47,295
Lloyd sent me tape of you and
you're incredibly funny, Johnny,

144
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:48,696
even though you don't mean to be.

145
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,898
<i>As a matter of fact,
after I watched your stuff</i>

146
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:53,568
I wrote 10 pages.
And it's good.

147
00:06:53,603 --> 00:06:57,538
Here, read it.
If you like it I'll write some more.

148
00:06:57,573 --> 00:07:00,508
Until then, I got
a mani-pedi to roll to.

149
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:02,176
- Ciao, Lloyd.
- Bye, sweetie.

150
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,744
- Take care, Roger.
- Yeah.

151
00:07:03,778 --> 00:07:07,514
- Well?
- What's with the arrogant has-been?

152
00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:10,216
I thought we were gonna get some
high-end showrunners in here.

153
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,517
- I'm setting all I can.
- What about Dick Wolf?

154
00:07:12,552 --> 00:07:16,287
He personally told me I was great
when I played a streaker in "S.V.U."

155
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:19,223
Drama, we've been calling everywhere.
We're gonna keep looking.

156
00:07:19,258 --> 00:07:21,458
In the meantime, let's just read
Roger's script.

157
00:07:21,493 --> 00:07:23,727
It was written just for you.

158
00:07:23,761 --> 00:07:26,529
Hopefully I'm not based
on his stay-at-home husband.

159
00:07:26,563 --> 00:07:28,831
What would be so wrong with
playing a stay-at-home husband?

160
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,799
Nothing, Lloyd.
Nothing.

161
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:33,068
Take it easy.

162
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:35,870
- You don't seem happy, Marvin.
- Your business stinks.

163
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:38,338
And you don't pay me.
Why would I be happy?

164
00:07:38,372 --> 00:07:41,307
- My business is growing.
- You lost two grand last month.

165
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:43,509
Yeah, but I lost three grand
the month before.

166
00:07:43,543 --> 00:07:45,277
That's because you
stopped eating lunch.

167
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:48,546
- There's got to be something I can do.
- Take out an insurance policy,

168
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:52,450
fake your death. We'll mail you
some cash to Guatemala or someplace.

169
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:55,386
Can you at least try and take
this seriously, please?

170
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,755
Hey, I'm dead serious.
You are running out of cash and fast.

171
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,124
I sank every dollar
I had into this, Marvin.

172
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:04,761
Yeah, I know that.
And Vince sunk in about 30 grand also.

173
00:08:04,795 --> 00:08:07,863
Sunk being the operative word.

174
00:08:07,898 --> 00:08:10,299
Nobody thought I could
pull this off when I started.

175
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:12,768
And look, I put together
a real business.

176
00:08:12,803 --> 00:08:16,071
Turtle, it's admirable what
you've attempted. I really mean that.

177
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:19,240
And to tell you the truth, you're
costing Vince a lot less money now

178
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:21,275
when you're working
than when you weren't.

179
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:23,343
But you're gonna
run out of cash soon

180
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:27,147
and you cannot get any more
money from Vince. That bank is closed.

181
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:30,216
You'd better figure out
something else and quick.

182
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:32,818
( Elevator dings )

183
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:35,353
- Ari, Ari, Ari.
- Barbara, Barbara, Barbara.

184
00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:37,022
Did you have a stroke
and now stutter?

185
00:08:37,056 --> 00:08:39,090
Is there something going on
that I should know about?

186
00:08:39,124 --> 00:08:41,792
- Something going on?
- With the N.F.L.?

187
00:08:43,128 --> 00:08:44,928
- Who told you?
- People are talking.

188
00:08:44,962 --> 00:08:47,130
- What people?
- What difference does it make?

189
00:08:47,164 --> 00:08:48,831
- Is it true?
- Yes, it's true.

190
00:08:48,865 --> 00:08:50,632
I was going to talk
to you about it today.

191
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:52,534
What does it mean?
Are you leaving here?

192
00:08:52,568 --> 00:08:55,636
- Of course not.
- That's not what people think.

193
00:08:55,671 --> 00:08:57,071
What people?

194
00:08:57,105 --> 00:08:58,739
The people who are talking.

195
00:08:58,773 --> 00:09:00,974
Let's straighten it out.
Let's get the people to stop talking.

196
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:04,677
Everyone, conference room quickly!

197
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,146
And quickly means run!

198
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,581
Ari, can we go to lunch today?

199
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,249
- What? No, why?
- I need to talk.

200
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:14,285
Email me.
Okay, people, here's the thing.

201
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,122
This merger has made me more
famous than I ever wanted to be.

202
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,824
I don't want to be known,
I don't want to be talked about.

203
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:22,392
I have ears everywhere.

204
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:24,494
Let me just say that if those ears

205
00:09:24,528 --> 00:09:28,431
hear about anyone talking about me,
that person will die.

206
00:09:28,465 --> 00:09:31,266
And I'm not threatening your jobs,
I'm threatening your lives.

207
00:09:31,301 --> 00:09:33,502
And I'm serious.
But here's what's happening,

208
00:09:33,536 --> 00:09:35,070
in case any of you have heard.

209
00:09:35,104 --> 00:09:39,007
I'm bringing an N.F.L. team
to Los Angeles.

210
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:42,243
( Cheering )

211
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:44,644
And it won't affect
this company, by the way,

212
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:47,213
except we all might have
really good football seats.

213
00:09:47,248 --> 00:09:49,882
Mike Ovitz couldn't do it.
I will.

214
00:09:53,153 --> 00:09:54,552
Shh.

215
00:09:54,587 --> 00:09:57,355
The N.F.L. has
a prestigious reputation.

216
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,857
What you say and do
can affect mine.

217
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,793
Don't.
Shh.

218
00:10:07,665 --> 00:10:10,200
- Ari.
- Didn't I tell you to email me?

219
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,168
- Are you mad at me about something?
- No.

220
00:10:12,202 --> 00:10:14,603
It was you who was twirling me around
in front of your wife.

221
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:16,605
I'm not mad at you.
I'm just busy. What's up?

222
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,207
Okay. I want to
ask you a question.

223
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:21,609
<i>And I want you to think about it
before you answer.</i>

224
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:23,744
- Speak.
- Andrew has left us.

225
00:10:23,778 --> 00:10:26,947
- He's obviously not coming back.
- He is in rehab.

226
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:31,184
- And when he's done rehabbing
he's coming back.
- Okay, in the meantime...

227
00:10:31,218 --> 00:10:33,952
I'm gonna be looking for someone else
to run the TV department.

228
00:10:33,987 --> 00:10:36,288
- I don't think you need to.
- No.

229
00:10:36,322 --> 00:10:38,089
<i>- I didn't even ask you yet.
- No.</i>

230
00:10:38,124 --> 00:10:39,824
And you didn't take time
to think about it.

231
00:10:39,858 --> 00:10:42,226
I just took time to think about it
and the answer is still no.

232
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,261
Okay, Ari, name one person
who is more qualified than me.

233
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:47,430
I don't know the names

234
00:10:47,464 --> 00:10:49,365
of any people
in the TV department.

235
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,733
And the only reason
I know your name is the reason

236
00:10:51,768 --> 00:10:53,935
no one is heading
our television department.

237
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:56,437
- It's no way to move up.
- Completely unfair.

238
00:10:56,471 --> 00:10:59,106
Tell that to Andrew's
fatherless children.

239
00:11:00,575 --> 00:11:03,243
Ari, I have delivered
for you and this company.

240
00:11:03,277 --> 00:11:05,844
I have kept Aaron Sorkin
happy since Andrew left.

241
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,947
I have signed
three top showrunners.

242
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:09,482
<i>I have packaged
four TV shows</i>

243
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:11,317
and I've been dealing
with all the tv talent

244
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:13,119
that everybody else
had been ignoring.

245
00:11:13,153 --> 00:11:15,454
My work speaks for itself

246
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:17,856
and I would like you
to reasonably consider that.

247
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,292
Well, since you put it like that,
um, no.

248
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:22,661
Ari, I'm not satisfied.

249
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:25,964
I'm sorry, kid, but I'm not the man
who's gonna satisfy you.

250
00:11:33,172 --> 00:11:34,973
Tell Murray to fuck off.

251
00:11:35,007 --> 00:11:37,876
He says if you don't get the wine,
don't bother coming back to work.

252
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,611
<i>Is that a joke?
Are you kidding me?</i>

253
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:42,447
- I'm afraid not.
- Did you tell him I'm here now?

254
00:11:42,482 --> 00:11:45,384
<i>Of course, but he still wanted me
to pass along the message.</i>

255
00:11:45,418 --> 00:11:48,019
Do you really want me
to pass back "fuck off"?

256
00:11:48,053 --> 00:11:50,221
No. I'll tell him myself
when I speak to him.

257
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:52,656
- Vince: See you later.
- See you soon, Vince.

258
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:54,157
- All good?
- Yeah.

259
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:56,326
- You sure?
- My boss is a fucking prick.

260
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,962
- E says he's a nice guy.
- E's marrying his goddaughter.
What else is he gonna say?

261
00:11:59,997 --> 00:12:01,630
I hear you.

262
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:04,599
- How cool is this?
- It's very cool.

263
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:09,069
That is the skull of a
recently discovered species of allosaurus.

264
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:10,771
It's Adrian Peterson's.

265
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:12,506
- Hey, Adrian.
- Vinnie Chase.

266
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,574
- I haven't seen you since New Orleans.
- Yeah.

267
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,743
- Hey, tough loss.
- They're all tough.

268
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,344
You guys trying to buy my skull?

269
00:12:18,378 --> 00:12:20,446
We were just browsing.
Why are you selling it?

270
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,081
Yeah, was Visan the Shiancoe
trying to use it as a cup?

271
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:25,483
( Chuckles ) Funny.
Just an investment.

272
00:12:25,518 --> 00:12:26,951
A very good one at that.

273
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:29,553
This is one of the most
rare skulls in the world.

274
00:12:29,588 --> 00:12:32,389
<i>- Really?
- Even more rare than
the one Nicolas Cage has.</i>

275
00:12:32,424 --> 00:12:34,458
Nicolas Cage has a dinosaur head?

276
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:36,860
I'm sure at this point
the I.R.S. has a dinosaur head.

277
00:12:36,895 --> 00:12:40,297
Quite possibly.
But he did outbid Leo for one in 2007.

278
00:12:40,332 --> 00:12:41,932
What did he pay?

279
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:45,102
- $275,000 I think.
- And you think this would go for more?

280
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:46,704
- It should.
- It better.

281
00:12:46,738 --> 00:12:48,672
- Good seeing you, Vince.
- Hey, see ya.

282
00:12:48,707 --> 00:12:53,376
You really think this would go
for more than $275,000?

283
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:55,178
Anything is possible
at an auction.

284
00:12:55,212 --> 00:12:58,879
But maybe somebody'll get lucky.

285
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:01,079
( Chuckles ) She wants to fuck.

286
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,214
You think I have to buy
the skull in order to?

287
00:13:03,248 --> 00:13:06,384
It couldn't hurt.
Oh, wait a minute.

288
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:09,587
Wait a minute.
This is perfect.

289
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,656
- Do you know Randall Wallace?
- Not personally, but I loved "Braveheart".

290
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,092
- You have to meet him.
- You have to introduce me.

291
00:13:15,126 --> 00:13:17,728
After you, please.
Hey, Randall.

292
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:21,265
- Hey, Scott Lavin.
- Oh, Scott.

293
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:23,167
- Yeah, how are you?
- Good to see you.

294
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:25,670
- Good to see you. How's Murray?
- Murray is, uh, dead.

295
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,738
I'm kidding.
I'm totally kidding.

296
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,373
Listen, you know Vinnie Chase?

297
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:32,076
Not personally, but I've wanted
to meet you for a long time.

298
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,745
- I'm a huge fan.
- He was just saying
what a fan of yours he was.

299
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:37,080
Just now.
I can't wait to see "Secretariat".

300
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:39,683
It's testing through the roof.
I can't wait for you to see it.

301
00:13:39,717 --> 00:13:42,986
I tried to sign Randall at the
"Pearl Harbor" premiere. You remember that?

302
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:45,755
Yeah, you were still in the mail room
at the time as I recall.

303
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,424
You have a very good memory.
It's true.

304
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,693
Why haven't you guys found
something to do together?

305
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:52,996
<i>- You've got to find something.
- Vince, I've got the perfect thing for you</i>

306
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,032
A Stan Lee superhero.
It's called "Air-walker."

307
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:58,101
- Interesting.
- I know you did "Aquaman".

308
00:13:58,135 --> 00:13:59,736
But this has a whole different feel.

309
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,704
- David Benioff wrote the script.
- Really?

310
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:04,207
Yeah, and I've been calling Ari
and I don't get a call back.

311
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:06,009
Talk to Scott.
He's right here.

312
00:14:06,043 --> 00:14:08,211
Immediately call me this week.
We'll get into it.

313
00:14:08,245 --> 00:14:09,512
I'll do it.
I'll call.

314
00:14:09,546 --> 00:14:11,280
- Good to see you.
- You too, Scott.

315
00:14:11,314 --> 00:14:13,382
- See you later.
- Nice to meet you, Vince.

316
00:14:15,185 --> 00:14:17,853
I think it's hysterical.
I know it's only 10 pages but it's funny.

317
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:20,155
Well, I don't get it
or know how to make it funny.

318
00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:22,023
You don't have to make it funny.
It is.

319
00:14:22,057 --> 00:14:24,893
- But I'm not funny, bro.
- Yes you are, Drama.

320
00:14:24,927 --> 00:14:26,761
That guy Roger was right.
Just play it straight.

321
00:14:26,795 --> 00:14:28,196
<i>Come on, read with me.</i>

322
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,665
I don't think you opposite me
(...) bringing up my best.

323
00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:32,233
Will you just read?

324
00:14:34,203 --> 00:14:36,938
"Why do you think that girl
was looking at you and not me?"

325
00:14:36,972 --> 00:14:39,207
- "Well, look at me."
- "Look at me.

326
00:14:39,241 --> 00:14:41,109
I think there's a whole
universe of women

327
00:14:41,143 --> 00:14:43,177
that would look at me
as better looking than you."

328
00:14:43,212 --> 00:14:45,780
"I'll agree, but while we're
living in this universe

329
00:14:45,814 --> 00:14:47,748
let's assume
she was looking at me."

330
00:14:47,783 --> 00:14:50,384
What, I'm playing the ugly guy?

331
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:53,654
No, you're playing the not-as-good-
looking-as-the-really-good-looking guy.

332
00:14:53,688 --> 00:14:57,391
- Yeah, good luck casting that.
- See that, Drama? You are funny.

333
00:14:58,827 --> 00:15:01,228
- You know what? Let's call Yagoda.
- Let's.

334
00:15:01,262 --> 00:15:04,431
In fact, let's just bring
it over to him. Come on.

335
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:07,067
Do you really need me or
can I go back to other parts of my life?

336
00:15:07,102 --> 00:15:08,703
You love hanging with me.
Besides,

337
00:15:08,737 --> 00:15:11,505
now that your boy Lavin stole Vince,
who else you got to hang with?

338
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,440
We'll hang later.

339
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:15,676
Your loss.

340
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,011
I'm just asking for a favor.

341
00:15:18,046 --> 00:15:19,913
We barely make
salary now, Turtle.

342
00:15:19,948 --> 00:15:21,682
But God knows how much
you make in tips.

343
00:15:21,716 --> 00:15:23,350
Tips are down with the economy.

344
00:15:23,384 --> 00:15:25,586
And mostly we get cash offers
to give blowjobs.

345
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,255
So is that what you're asking us
to do to make decent money?

346
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,391
Of course I'm not,
but I got no choice.

347
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:32,626
If I want to expand
I've got to make more money.

348
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:35,262
In order to make more money
I've got to pay you guys less.

349
00:15:35,297 --> 00:15:37,565
- How much less?
- Half.

350
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:40,034
<i>- What?!
- And I can't pay for your lunches anymore.</i>

351
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:42,236
- Well, what if we say no?
- You could stay on,

352
00:15:42,271 --> 00:15:44,505
but I'd be looking for replacements
willing to work cheaper.

353
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:47,407
You're gonna be looking at some
butt-ugly replacements.

354
00:15:47,442 --> 00:15:49,009
Come on, Sarah, please.

355
00:15:49,043 --> 00:15:51,344
- I'm sorry, honey, I can't do it.
- Abby?

356
00:15:51,378 --> 00:15:53,479
I can't either.
I'm barely making rent now.

357
00:15:53,513 --> 00:15:56,649
Seriously, Turtle, we can make
more money being extras on a set.

358
00:15:56,683 --> 00:16:00,719
We were doing this becauseit gave us
more free time to work on other stuff.

359
00:16:00,753 --> 00:16:03,488
- Sorry, Turtle.
- I'm sorry.

360
00:16:05,224 --> 00:16:07,225
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

361
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:09,460
- Turtle?
- Yeah?

362
00:16:09,494 --> 00:16:12,262
Any way we can
get our checks today?

363
00:16:12,297 --> 00:16:15,131
Tomorrow. Just got to transfer
money into that account.

364
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:17,166
- Oh, God.
- Yeah, I thought so.

365
00:16:17,201 --> 00:16:19,035
- What?
- Bye, Turtle.

366
00:16:21,238 --> 00:16:22,872
Ari.

367
00:16:22,906 --> 00:16:26,175
Didn't we already top our one
conversation per day rule, Babs?

368
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:27,777
I want to talk about Lizzie.

369
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:30,079
Oh, Jesus, she went
running to her grandmother.

370
00:16:30,113 --> 00:16:31,847
I think she's a star.

371
00:16:31,881 --> 00:16:34,249
And I think she's a star
who we can get for a lot less

372
00:16:34,283 --> 00:16:37,218
than anybody we bring in from the
outside to run our TV department.

373
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:38,919
Why don't you run
the TV department?

374
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:40,387
<i>- Why don't you?
- Barbara.</i>

375
00:16:40,422 --> 00:16:43,056
Is this because of what
happened between her and Andrew?

376
00:16:43,091 --> 00:16:45,258
It's because I don't think she's ready.

377
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:47,694
- Well, I think she is.
- She looks 21.

378
00:16:47,728 --> 00:16:49,396
- Her looks don't matter.
- Really?

379
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,165
We'd still have the head of our
TV department if that were the case.

380
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,269
- So it is about that.
- No, Barbara, it's about...

381
00:16:55,303 --> 00:16:59,343
Ari, she going to quit if we don't
give her what she wants.

382
00:16:59,378 --> 00:17:02,813
- She said that?
- Yes, and I'd hate to lose her.

383
00:17:04,582 --> 00:17:06,649
- But she's not ready.
- Band threatening to quit

384
00:17:06,684 --> 00:17:08,584
'cause she didn't get
her way proves that.

385
00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:10,686
Everyone knows
I don't respond to threats.

386
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,055
And neither should you.
I'm calling her bluff.

387
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,990
She's gonna be a superstar, Ari.

388
00:17:15,024 --> 00:17:16,524
I'm calling her bluff.

389
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:19,660
So tell her to show us
her goddamn cards.

390
00:17:19,694 --> 00:17:21,795
Maybe I should have
a say in this too.

391
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:24,030
You had your say
and you were overruled.

392
00:17:24,064 --> 00:17:25,864
You don't get to overrule me!

393
00:17:25,899 --> 00:17:29,267
Barbara, this girl caused
the demise of my best friend.

394
00:17:29,302 --> 00:17:32,403
You take up her cause now
and it'll be the demise of us.

395
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:34,405
Tell her to keep
her pretty head down

396
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:36,874
and when she's ready
she'll get hers.

397
00:17:36,908 --> 00:17:38,975
Maybe I'll just tell her
you're a jackass.

398
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,878
Oh, good cop, bad cop game.
I like it.

399
00:17:41,912 --> 00:17:43,713
Maybe later we can role-play, huh?

400
00:17:43,747 --> 00:17:47,850
Is it just me or would you look great
in leather pants and a gag ball?

401
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:50,586
<i>- ( Dance music playing )

A toast to bond
for this fine wine.

403
00:18:01,362 --> 00:18:03,196
Yeah, I'm a dead person.

404
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,830
Are you really afraid of Murray?

405
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:07,032
Come on, like you said,
I'm a client too.

406
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:09,768
Fuck Murray. I am not afraid of Murray.
I'm afraid of Bond.

407
00:18:09,803 --> 00:18:11,303
We'll buy him more.

408
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:13,772
( Laughs )
"We'll buy him more." This is rare shit.

409
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:15,940
I know, and rare shit tastes amazing.

410
00:18:15,975 --> 00:18:17,842
Yes, it does.
Oh, well.

411
00:18:17,877 --> 00:18:20,178
- I'll just blame Murray.
- Now you're thinking.

412
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:21,813
Come on, guys,
are we playing or what?

413
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:24,314
Yeah yeah yeah, we're playing.
Come on, let's play.

414
00:18:24,349 --> 00:18:26,517
One second.
Turtle.

415
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:29,486
- Where you going? Let's hang.
- Got to wash the cars.

416
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:32,855
- Don't you have someone to do that for you?
- Cutting costs.

417
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:35,024
All right, I'm back.

418
00:18:35,058 --> 00:18:37,059
- What are we playing?
- Truth or dare.

419
00:18:37,094 --> 00:18:38,694
That is my favorite game
in the whole wide world.

420
00:18:38,728 --> 00:18:40,929
Great, I'll go first.
Truth.

421
00:18:40,963 --> 00:18:43,765
Okay, which one of us
do you want to fuck more?

422
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:47,334
Really? You could ask me anything
and that's what you want to know?

423
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:49,502
- Mm-hmm.
- Here's the good news, ladies.

424
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:51,403
One way or another,
everyone's gonna get fucked.

425
00:18:51,438 --> 00:18:54,439
- Okay?
- All right.

426
00:18:54,474 --> 00:18:57,841
"Look at me. I think there's a whole
universe of women

427
00:18:57,876 --> 00:19:00,343
that would look at me
as better looking than you."

428
00:19:00,378 --> 00:19:02,712
"I'll agree, but while
we're living in this universe

429
00:19:02,746 --> 00:19:04,513
let's assume she
was looking at me."

430
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:07,515
"Assumption denied."

431
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,018
<i>- Maybe you are funny.
- That's what I learned today.</i>

432
00:19:10,052 --> 00:19:13,420
The only problem I see
is I'm also good looking.

433
00:19:13,455 --> 00:19:15,856
So who are we gonna find
to play the second male lead?

434
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,391
- I got a great idea.
- What? What is it?

435
00:19:18,426 --> 00:19:20,560
Let me see what I can do first.
I don't want to get you excited.

436
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:22,795
I'm already excited.
Look at me.

437
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,463
Johnny, you really are funny.
You know what?

438
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,564
Get out of here. I've got work to do.
I'll call you in a little bit.

439
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:29,100

How are you?

<i>- Not happy.
- What's wrong?</i>

444
00:19:45,514 --> 00:19:47,615
Well, that check
you gave me... it bounced.

445
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:49,450
Shit. I'm sorry.
I should have called

446
00:19:49,484 --> 00:19:51,585
and told you to hold off
cashing it till tomorrow.

447
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,888
<i>- Yeah, you should have.
- Just some banking issues.
I'll sort it out.</i>

448
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:56,722
When?
'Cause I really need the money.

449
00:19:56,756 --> 00:19:58,524
You can cash it
tomorrow for sure.

450
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:01,860
<i>- But if it's an emergency
I'll get it done today.
- Okay, thanks.</i>

00:20:01,894 --> 00:20:03,695
You know what? It's fine.

452
00:20:03,729 --> 00:20:07,399
I'll wait till tomorrow. I just thought
you stop payment or something.

<i>- Why would I do that?
- I don't know.</i>

<i>'Cause you didn't
really want to pay me.</i>

Why do you think
I'm such a bad guy?

456
00:20:12,572 --> 00:20:15,874
I don't. I've got trust issues.
I'm working on it.

Sorry, I've got problems too.
All the girls just quit.

to fuck them also?

Cutbacks.
Business isn't great.

I thought you were doing so well.

462

not really gonna clear.

No, it'll be fine tomorrow.

my hands to myself.

00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:21,263
I think you just need
to get used to letting go

485
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:23,365
and let Vince figure
stuff out on his own.

486
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,134
Yeah, you're right.

487
00:21:25,168 --> 00:21:27,002
I've got a great job, great fiancee.

I probably should have
put you first, right?

489
00:21:30,173 --> 00:21:33,008
Yeah, you probably should.
I'm proud of you, babe.

490
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,843
I love you.

491
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,812
Relax, okay?

492
00:21:36,846 --> 00:21:38,647
We're gonna have
a wonderful night.

493
00:21:38,682 --> 00:21:41,116

- Oh yes, thank you.

00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:53,628
- Grab another bottle.
- All right.

497

I like her. I like you.
I like you more.

498

- That would be amazing.
- It's paradise.

Hello. Come to the party.
Sit, please.

- Let's go in here.
- Oh, sorry.

Isn't that the girl

You can count it.

- Not as far as I know.

509

Thanks, I actually really needed this.

I'll be all right.

I've got a way we could
both make some money.

- This guy down in Mexico.

I mean, I used to sell

- It's not drugs.

00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:05,100
Come down to Mexico with me.
I'll introduce you.

Maybe, I don't know.
You think he's better looking than me?

534
00:23:32,061 --> 00:23:35,163
Maybe, John. Anyway, he likes
the idea and the network loves him.

535

Hey, Johnny, how'd it go?

00:23:55,817 --> 00:23:57,851

Do you think John Stamos
is better looking than Drama?

- No way.
- Shit.

I don't know, Ari.
But my guess is many will want her.

I'm not gonna give her
a good recommendation, are you?

584
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:43,876

You know what?
Spending some time with your boys,

realizing maybe you're not as soft
as I've been treating you.

- No.
- I think we should be friends.

bring Vince projects anymore, okay?

I do that alone.
