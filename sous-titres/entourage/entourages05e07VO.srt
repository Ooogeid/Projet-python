Subtitles:

3
00:01:24,603 --> 00:01:27,362
- I feel small. You feel small, E?
- Shut up, Turtle.

4
00:01:27,482 --> 00:01:29,385
There's no need to be shy.
They're just models.

5
00:01:29,505 --> 00:01:31,399
I'm not. I can't wait
till I get to fuck a girl

6
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,193
while she rests her tits
on my forehead.

7
00:01:33,313 --> 00:01:34,852
Like you could ever get a model.

8
00:01:34,972 --> 00:01:36,988
- What, like you could?
- Like either of you could.

9
00:01:37,108 --> 00:01:39,767
- E did. Perfect 10 model, remember?
- Thank you.

10
00:01:39,887 --> 00:01:42,720
Come on, bro. She was a west
coast model. That don't count.

11
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,357
Why?
What's the difference?

12
00:01:44,517 --> 00:01:47,670
That's like asking what's the difference
between Central Park and Park La Brea.

13
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,850
When have you been to Central Park?

14
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,410
I don't brag to you guys
about all my conquests.

15
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,069
Usually you just lie about them.

16
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:56,365
I've never even heard him
lie about a model.

17
00:01:56,485 --> 00:01:58,630
Whatever. Tonight
I'm gonna fuck something so tall

18
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,135
her scuff marks
will be on my ceiling for proof.

19
00:02:01,492 --> 00:02:03,752
These accessories
are not the best look for you.

20
00:02:04,131 --> 00:02:05,495
Why you so mean?

21
00:02:05,615 --> 00:02:07,793
Come on, I need a little support.
I'm feeling insecure.

22
00:02:07,913 --> 00:02:10,631
Don't, because while Hollywood
doesn't appreciate this gorgeous face,

23
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:12,579
the fashion world does.
Now are you excited?

24
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,854
I don't know.
I'm an actor, not a model.

25
00:02:14,974 --> 00:02:18,262
Dolce & Gabbana's gonna pay you 1 M$
for a one-day photo shoot in Italy.

26
00:02:18,382 --> 00:02:20,060
You'll act
like a fucking model, okay?

27
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,660
He will.
And he's excited.

28
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,146
- Good.
- Hey, Shauna.

29
00:02:23,548 --> 00:02:27,129
Come on, I want to introduce you
to the man who made this all happen.

30
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:29,536
We'll be over here
scoping out the terrain.

31
00:02:29,656 --> 00:02:31,070
Good luck, Johnny.

32
00:02:31,456 --> 00:02:32,866
How you doing, baby?

33
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:36,185
Fucking Euro.

34
00:02:36,517 --> 00:02:39,463
- Fredrick, how are you?
- Hello, you sexy thing.

35
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:41,706
- How are you?
- How you doing? Good.

36
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:43,948
You have a very sexy publicist,
you know that?

37
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:45,073
I know.

38
00:02:45,193 --> 00:02:47,045
Fredrick Lyne. Call me Freddy.

39
00:02:47,517 --> 00:02:49,813
Freddy's the marketing genius
who put Madonna and Halle Berry

40
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:51,875
in the Versace campaigns
when he was over there.

41
00:02:51,995 --> 00:02:54,099
I put people together with things.
And you, sunshine,

42
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:56,179
- I could put together with anything.
- Fabulous.

43
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:58,627
Now Annie Leibovitz is shooting it.
You met her?

44
00:02:58,747 --> 00:03:01,076
Lovely girl. Not quick,
but she's very very good.

45
00:03:01,196 --> 00:03:04,088
We're shooting at Mick Jagger's
estate, which is unbelievable.

46
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,170
Sounds great.

47
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,306
Natasha!
I want you to meet your co-star,

48
00:03:07,426 --> 00:03:09,041
'cause she is something else.

49
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:13,364
Sorry.

50
00:03:13,646 --> 00:03:14,638
Guys,

51
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:17,296
this ravishing creature
here is Natasha Ladianova.

52
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:21,019
She is fast becoming the hottest
model on the entire planet bar none.

53
00:03:21,353 --> 00:03:22,695
Think you can see why.

54
00:03:22,815 --> 00:03:24,580
Natasha,
Vincent Chase.

55
00:03:24,976 --> 00:03:26,613
- Hey.
- Hi.

56
00:03:29,272 --> 00:03:31,339
- Eric murphy. How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

57
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:34,640
They look fantastic together.
You've got an amazing eye.

58
00:03:36,994 --> 00:03:38,012
Yeah, great.

59
00:03:38,172 --> 00:03:40,640
Listen, I've got to drag you off
to meet some magazine people.

60
00:03:43,152 --> 00:03:44,755
Yeah, certainly,
bye.

61
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,531
I'll see you later
at the fitting, yes?

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,430
Nice to meet you guys.

63
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:52,117
You fucked that girl, didn't you?

64
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,459
But you know her.

65
00:04:04,516 --> 00:04:08,251
I hate myself for the fact
that even today I still don't like you.

66
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:09,828
I mean, I want to.
I do.

67
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:11,777
Baby, I'm--

68
00:04:14,118 --> 00:04:15,699
I am so sorry.

69
00:04:16,304 --> 00:04:18,578
Yeah, it's a shame.
He was having a good run.

70
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,308
I was on the golf course
with him when it happened.

71
00:04:24,653 --> 00:04:27,269
You know, he promised
Vincent Chase <i>Smokejumpers</i>.

72
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:30,773
We should keep that good run
going by honoring that promise.

73
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:33,491
I'll speak to you
after we've paid our respects.

74
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:34,937
Of course. Of course.

75
00:04:37,128 --> 00:04:39,706
Listen, just excuse me
for one second, baby.

76
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:41,747
No business, Ari.
Respect.

77
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:45,082
Respect means keeping business
alive even when you're dead.

78
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,376
Remember that.

79
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,313
What do you say we bring Vince back
to the studio to pay tribute to Alan?

80
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,872
I sell airplane engines.

81
00:04:56,307 --> 00:04:58,711
The studio accounts
for 5% of our business.

82
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:01,273
I can't focus
on who's doing what in what movie.

83
00:05:01,393 --> 00:05:04,657
- His replacement will have to do that.
- Who you thinking about?

84
00:05:05,107 --> 00:05:06,684
I'm thinking about you.

85
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,983
Really?

86
00:05:09,103 --> 00:05:11,064
I thought about you
when I fist hired Alan,

87
00:05:11,535 --> 00:05:13,142
but you were still a bit green.

88
00:05:13,262 --> 00:05:16,184
- A lot has changed since then.
- It certainly has.

89
00:05:16,304 --> 00:05:17,876
You've made me an even richer man

90
00:05:17,996 --> 00:05:20,032
by bringing me three
tentpoles in three years.

91
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:22,293
Maybe it's time
I returned the favor.

92
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:25,896
Ready to move from the ground floor
to the penthouse?

93
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,923
- You saw the connection.
- I think everyone did.

94
00:05:32,043 --> 00:05:34,717
I only saw Drama strike out
with every model in the place.

95
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:37,035
Shut it.
These things take time.

96
00:05:37,155 --> 00:05:39,541
Vince had an 11-hour flight
to secure that chemistry.

97
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:42,251
L.A. to london. I don't even
remember why I was going,

98
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:44,494
- but I definitely remember Natasha.
- 11 hours?

99
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:47,592
- Why didn't you just mile-high it?
- We were both in a relationship.

100
00:05:47,712 --> 00:05:50,093
- How do you know she's not now?
- I can tell.

101
00:05:59,654 --> 00:06:01,083
Ready for round two, Drama?

102
00:06:01,473 --> 00:06:03,834
Funny.
But the odds are in my favor here.

103
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:05,263
How do you figure?

104
00:06:05,383 --> 00:06:07,555
It's a fitting.
They're already naked and vulnerable.

105
00:06:07,675 --> 00:06:09,080
Just try not to get arrested.

106
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,256
At least in jail
he can probably get some.

107
00:06:11,376 --> 00:06:13,209
Whatever.
Watch and learn.

108
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:14,560
Incoming.

109
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:16,529
Hi there.

110
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:18,879
I hear you joined
the Dolce & Gabbana campaign.

111
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:20,514
Yes, I'm very excited.

112
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:23,426
I recognize you. You were on the cover
of <i>Vogue</i> last month.

113
00:06:23,546 --> 00:06:25,166
- <i>Cosmo</i>.
- Right.

114
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:27,849
A very nice spread,
if I may say.

115
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:29,824
Thank you.
I recognize you too.

116
00:06:30,127 --> 00:06:32,120
- Oh yeah?
- You were on <i>The View</i>.

117
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,480
You had a meltdown.
Not very nice, if I may say.

118
00:06:34,688 --> 00:06:36,315
It's not his finest hour.

119
00:06:39,277 --> 00:06:40,611
Do I know you?

120
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,071
I'm Eric.

121
00:06:42,474 --> 00:06:44,623
- I'm Raina.
- Nice to meet you.

122
00:06:44,743 --> 00:06:46,492
Good things come in small packages.

123
00:06:49,347 --> 00:06:52,040
Nice to meet you, Vince.
And you, Eric.

124
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,344
What the hell was that?

125
00:06:55,464 --> 00:06:57,836
I don't know.
I think she thinks you're cute.

126
00:06:57,956 --> 00:07:00,173
Cute like a little
compact bundle of joy.

127
00:07:00,293 --> 00:07:02,404
More like you're so little and cute

128
00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:05,324
she wants to strap something on
and stuff you like a turkey.

129
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:07,346
Can I get you over here
to get started?

130
00:07:07,506 --> 00:07:09,182
Sure.
I'll be right back.

131
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:10,870
Thank you.

132
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,690
- So is Natasha here yet?
- You mean Helena?

133
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,787
Hi.

134
00:07:15,592 --> 00:07:17,322
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, how are you?

135
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:18,816
Vincent Chase, there he is.

136
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:20,866
- The man, the legend.
- So what do you think?

137
00:07:20,986 --> 00:07:22,339
Let's have a look at you.

138
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:25,096
- Very very nice. Turn around.
- Thank you.

139
00:07:25,216 --> 00:07:27,950
Absolutely terrible in the ass.
Do something about that, please.

140
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,734
So, Freddy,
is Natasha not coming?

141
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:32,371
This is Helena, her replacement.
Did you meet?

142
00:07:33,284 --> 00:07:36,035
- Replacement? What happened?
- I don't know. She's a model, you know?

143
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,147
Probably had her period,
thought she got stabbed.

144
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:40,801
All right, come on.
Let's get the pants on.

145
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,082
How would you like
to be fucking a studio head, baby?

146
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:46,934
- Ron Meyers is pretty handsome.
- Seriously, what do you think?

147
00:07:47,054 --> 00:07:50,984
I think I've never seen anyone
so giddy after a funeral.

148
00:07:51,353 --> 00:07:54,393
This is the kind of offer you dream
about getting your whole life.

149
00:07:54,676 --> 00:07:56,690
- So you're gonna take it?
- I don't know.

150
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,474
- Your clients will be pretty upset.
- Give me a break, honey.

151
00:07:59,594 --> 00:08:02,367
Look, there's probably maybe
two clients that I really care about.

152
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:04,586
Vinnie is one of them.
And if I take the job

153
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:06,894
I can put him
in this movie that he wants.

154
00:08:09,004 --> 00:08:11,869
Dana gordon, you're on speakerphone
and my wife's in the car.

155
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:18,693
- <i>So how was the funeral?</i>
- It was fun.

156
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:20,559
So you spoke to John?

157
00:08:21,636 --> 00:08:23,339
Spoke to John about what?

158
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,467
I was at that place for a decade.
I know all about it.

159
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:29,250
- What do you want?
- I want to be under you.

160
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,330
Dana, I told you
my wife's in the car.

161
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:33,810
<i>Very funny.
I want to be your number two.</i>

162
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,224
I know everyone there.
I helped build that place.

163
00:08:36,344 --> 00:08:39,313
And if it weren't for Alan being
such a woman-hating piece of shit,

164
00:08:39,473 --> 00:08:42,024
- <i>I'd still be helping</i>.
- Understood. Listen, let's see

165
00:08:42,184 --> 00:08:44,521
- <i>how it plays out.
- </i>Just asking for consideration.

166
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:46,536
- I'll get back to you.
- <i>Bye</i>.

167
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:48,982
"I'm on speaker
with my wife in the car"?

168
00:08:49,102 --> 00:08:51,843
- It's common courtesy.
- What were you afraid she's gonna say?

169
00:08:51,963 --> 00:08:53,202
- Nothing.
- Who is she?

170
00:08:53,362 --> 00:08:55,746
Nobody.
She's a studio exec. A good one.

171
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,957
She'd make a great number two.

172
00:08:58,117 --> 00:08:59,292
Did you fuck her?

173
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,209
Maybe she wouldn't.

174
00:09:03,874 --> 00:09:05,845
Who gives a shit
why some model quit?

175
00:09:05,965 --> 00:09:09,260
They're like cockroaches, stamp one out
and 50 lookalikes show up.

176
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,236
I want a number, not a lecture.

177
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:13,828
I can't get it and her agency
wants to know who it's for

178
00:09:13,948 --> 00:09:16,634
because apparently 50 actors
a week call trying to bang her.

179
00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:17,619
<i>Great</i>.

180
00:09:17,739 --> 00:09:19,645
What's the big deal?
You really like this one?

181
00:09:19,805 --> 00:09:21,839
I'm just curious
to know what happened.

182
00:09:22,064 --> 00:09:23,983
Christy, where are
all the models staying?

183
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:27,195
- At the W
- The W Vince.

184
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:29,863
G there if it's really eating you,
but go cautiously

185
00:09:29,983 --> 00:09:32,817
because if she really did quit over you,
showing up could be really creepy.

186
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:33,944
Thanks.

187
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:36,403
You don't think she quit
'cause of me, do you?

188
00:09:36,523 --> 00:09:38,119
- No way.
- Maybe.

189
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,045
It's possible.

190
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,756
How was the funeral?

191
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,524
It was delightful.
Are you kidding?

192
00:09:47,644 --> 00:09:49,674
Alan has not looked
that good in years.

193
00:09:49,794 --> 00:09:51,206
That's very macabre.

194
00:09:51,326 --> 00:09:53,804
- What's been going on here?
- Jeffrey Tambor stopped by.

195
00:09:53,964 --> 00:09:56,131
- Oh god, is he gone?
- Yes, but he said he'll be back.

196
00:09:56,251 --> 00:09:58,457
- Excellent. What else?
- Barbara's been looking for you.

197
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:00,038
Don't tell her I'm back.

198
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:02,344
- I won't say a word.
- Babs, what's the haps?

199
00:10:02,464 --> 00:10:04,440
Sussman and Levinson
want some face time with you.

200
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,676
They're your clients.

201
00:10:05,796 --> 00:10:08,024
They're coming in for a meeting.
Do they have your support?

202
00:10:08,144 --> 00:10:10,404
They're reality tv writers,
so they don't have my support.

203
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:13,142
They made $4 million last year.

204
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:15,017
Understood,
but they're your clients.

205
00:10:15,137 --> 00:10:17,569
- They want to branch out.
- To what, the circus?

206
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:19,538
Features.

207
00:10:19,698 --> 00:10:22,188
Oh come on.
I met those freaks.

208
00:10:22,308 --> 00:10:24,398
If it wasn't for losers
eating bull cock tempura,

209
00:10:24,518 --> 00:10:26,587
they'd be lucky to produce
a decent infomercial.

210
00:10:26,747 --> 00:10:29,315
They're coming in after lunch.
Do you have a minute to say hello?

211
00:10:29,435 --> 00:10:31,520
- Tell her I'm busy.
- He's got a lot on his plate.

212
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,130
- I'll bring them by.
- Come with a gun.

213
00:10:37,747 --> 00:10:38,852
What's this?

214
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,360
It came this morning
with that box and that note.

215
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,480
- Do you want me to read it?
- I want you to get out. Close the door.

216
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:49,026
"THERE'S A BRIGHTER FUTURE WAITING"

217
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,511
Jesus!

218
00:10:54,817 --> 00:10:57,335
- What've you got there?
- I asked you to get the fuck out.

219
00:10:57,455 --> 00:11:00,445
Yes, but John Ellis is on the phone.
I figured you'd want it.

220
00:11:00,565 --> 00:11:01,820
Put him through.

221
00:11:02,058 --> 00:11:03,791
Like the new watch, Ari gold.

222
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:05,372
And your little plane.

223
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:08,421
I love the watch.

224
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:11,039
That's an Audemars Piguet

225
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,592
Possibly the finest timepiece
known to man.

226
00:11:13,752 --> 00:11:15,753
What can I say?
I'm a fan.

227
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:19,392
Fan enough to come to Geneva
to watch me try to buy the company?

228
00:11:20,742 --> 00:11:21,934
Are you serious?

229
00:11:22,094 --> 00:11:24,791
I never fuck around when
I'm talking about a billion-dollar deal.

230
00:11:24,911 --> 00:11:27,773
Bring your wife. I'll show you
Switzerland on a Wednesday.

231
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,138
<i>I'll also show you what could be.</i>

232
00:11:30,258 --> 00:11:33,070
Well, you know, I got a lot
of things going on here.

233
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:35,114
No pressure.
It's not how I do it.

234
00:11:35,718 --> 00:11:38,117
<i>I've got a Gulfstream
leaving out of Van Nuys at 7:00.</i>

235
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:41,996
If you're on it, good.
If not, I'll talk to you when I'm back.

236
00:11:42,174 --> 00:11:43,430
<i>Enjoy the day.</i>

237
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:46,816
Are you hiding something from me?

238
00:11:46,936 --> 00:11:48,896
Only my cock and my asshole.

239
00:11:57,222 --> 00:12:00,139
- How you doing, honey?
- Which one of us are you calling honey?

240
00:12:01,193 --> 00:12:03,184
Whichever one of you is interested.

241
00:12:03,628 --> 00:12:05,061
That would be neither of us.

242
00:12:07,332 --> 00:12:09,714
These models
must all be cycling together

243
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:12,329
- 'cause they got bad attitudes.
- You got bad game.

244
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:15,154
- Yours is pretty good today too.
- I've given up playing.

245
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:18,659
Now, I'm just hoping an insecure
civilian walks by that I can fuck.

246
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,912
- That's just sad.
- Room 813.

247
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:22,503
We'll wait down here.

248
00:12:22,623 --> 00:12:24,713
- Don't do anything we wouldn't do.
- I won't.

249
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,416
And don't forget to tell her
no one likes a quitter, bro.

250
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,001
Okay, Johnny.

251
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:30,991
No one likes a quitter?

252
00:12:31,471 --> 00:12:32,706
I need a drink.

253
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,869
- I got this one.
- Big shot.

254
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:38,884
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

255
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,224
Strange seeing you here.
You're not following me, are you?

256
00:12:43,487 --> 00:12:45,827
Actually, no. Vince is meeting
with one of your co-workers.

257
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:47,776
And who are you meeting with?

258
00:12:47,896 --> 00:12:50,100
- I'm not meeting with anyone.
- Yes you are. Me.

259
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,071
You boys mind if I kidnap him?

260
00:12:52,191 --> 00:12:55,495
You have any friends
that might want to hold us hostage?

261
00:12:55,994 --> 00:12:58,225
- Where are you taking me?
- Don't fight me.

262
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:01,806
If you do I will sweep you off your feet
and carry you to my room.

263
00:13:03,244 --> 00:13:06,997
Am I not the one
on the network fucking tv show?

264
00:13:14,707 --> 00:13:16,090
I'm vivica.
Come on in.

265
00:13:17,018 --> 00:13:18,058
Thank you.

266
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,311
Is Natasha here?

267
00:13:20,557 --> 00:13:21,857
No, she left.

268
00:13:22,805 --> 00:13:24,277
Really?
Where'd she go?

269
00:13:24,397 --> 00:13:26,444
She had to go to Majorca, I think.

270
00:13:26,564 --> 00:13:27,873
Or maybe Hawaii.

271
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,113
At least they're both hot.

272
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:34,066
Yeah, I think she was more excited
about going to Italy with you.

273
00:13:34,974 --> 00:13:36,815
And if she wasn't so worried
about her career

274
00:13:36,935 --> 00:13:38,873
she would have told Fredrick
to go fuck himself.

275
00:13:38,993 --> 00:13:40,462
Really?
What happened?

276
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:42,742
- He told me she quit.
- Of course he did.

277
00:13:42,862 --> 00:13:45,005
He's a fucking liar
and he's obsessed with her.

278
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,943
He saw you two vibing at the party

279
00:13:47,063 --> 00:13:49,290
so he moved her to the lookbook
shoot and shipped her off.

280
00:13:49,842 --> 00:13:51,055
Are you serious?

281
00:13:52,051 --> 00:13:54,819
Listen, don't tell him this because
I still want to work for him,

282
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:57,663
- but Fredrick's a psycho.
- Yeah, sounds like it.

283
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,508
Do you have her number?

284
00:13:59,712 --> 00:14:00,843
Sorry, I don't.

285
00:14:01,003 --> 00:14:02,994
How about I leave you mine
in case you see her?

286
00:14:03,114 --> 00:14:04,512
Sure, go ahead.

287
00:14:04,632 --> 00:14:06,719
You know, you should stick around.

288
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,340
I was about to puff a J,
take a bath.

289
00:14:09,803 --> 00:14:10,936
You could join.

290
00:14:11,805 --> 00:14:14,469
Sounds tempting--
Very tempting.

291
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:16,843
But I don't think
that's such a good idea.

292
00:14:17,303 --> 00:14:20,712
Okay, but I was just
testing you anyway.

293
00:14:20,971 --> 00:14:23,602
I'm gonna tell Natasha
that you're a good guy.

294
00:14:23,722 --> 00:14:24,740
Thank you.

295
00:14:32,193 --> 00:14:33,266
Nice room.

296
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:36,529
Big stars get the biggest rooms.
No offense to the little people,

297
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:39,924
- present company excluded of course.
- That's funny.

298
00:14:40,226 --> 00:14:41,926
Humor is one of many talents.

299
00:14:42,595 --> 00:14:44,804
Would you like to see
some of my others?

300
00:14:48,665 --> 00:14:49,900
You coming?

301
00:14:52,398 --> 00:14:53,459
In there?

302
00:15:02,173 --> 00:15:04,417
I heard you're a very
successful talent manager.

303
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:07,780
- Yeah, I've been getting into the--
- I would like to show you my reel.

304
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:09,161
No problem.

305
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:11,041
Good.

306
00:15:17,295 --> 00:15:18,671
Very natural, no?

307
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:28,578
- Busy day.
- Hey, Jeff.

308
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:30,701
I tried to stop him but
he could see you--

309
00:15:30,821 --> 00:15:34,103
- Like you could stop me anyway.
- Very true, Jeffrey.

310
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,989
What's going on?
I called you this morning.

311
00:15:37,109 --> 00:15:40,192
- You call me every morning.
- But you did not call me back.

312
00:15:40,352 --> 00:15:42,247
But I always call you back, okay?

313
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:44,648
Did you think maybe that
I had something else going on?

314
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:46,550
What did you have going on?

315
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:49,217
Alan Gray died.

316
00:15:49,337 --> 00:15:51,362
Yeah, so what?
I hated that prick.

317
00:15:51,482 --> 00:15:54,308
- I know you did.
- You know, that man had the audacity

318
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:58,402
to tell me that he was gonna put me
in the Branagh film?

319
00:15:58,522 --> 00:16:00,421
- Yeah, I know.
- I'm not in that.

320
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:02,380
I know.
I know.

321
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,416
Who's the new guy gonna be?

322
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,720
- Hope he likes me.
- How could he not?

323
00:16:08,287 --> 00:16:10,973
- What are you doing for lunch?
- Let me-- Jeff.

324
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,099
How come
you don't do another tv show?

325
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:19,565
I don't want to do any more tv.
That's satan's work.

326
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:23,632
- But you're bored out of your mind.
- Well get me a fucking job.

327
00:16:23,752 --> 00:16:26,362
Every day I get an offer for you
and you don't want to do anything.

328
00:16:26,482 --> 00:16:28,616
- I wanted to do that Pitt film.
- You wanted his role.

329
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:30,387
You're a dick.
Listen to me.

330
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,477
- You listening?
- Yes.

331
00:16:32,963 --> 00:16:34,997
I brought the breakdowns.

332
00:16:35,157 --> 00:16:38,083
I just want to go through everything
that they're getting ready to shoot

333
00:16:38,243 --> 00:16:40,627
and I want to see
what you think I'm right for.

334
00:16:40,747 --> 00:16:42,963
Now look at this,
<i>Good Goodbye</i>.

335
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,823
How bad can that be?
Can we?

336
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:48,510
<i>Big Deal Jimmy</i>.

337
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:51,263
What the fuck is wrong
with <i>Big Deal Jimmy</i>?

338
00:16:51,423 --> 00:16:53,899
I could be in that.
<i>Laugh Laugh Daddy</i>.

339
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,346
There has to be
a father's role in there.

340
00:16:57,104 --> 00:17:00,227
Come on, you can fuck whoever you want.
Just do it after this campaign.

341
00:17:00,347 --> 00:17:03,310
I can't work a job knowing
that a girl got fired because of me.

342
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,778
You're gonna make $1 million
for looking pretty.

343
00:17:05,998 --> 00:17:09,821
$1 million that you and those morons
standing behind you desperately need.

344
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:11,516
So please, don't fuck this up.

345
00:17:11,636 --> 00:17:14,237
- Shauna, give me the address.
- What are you gonna do?

346
00:17:14,357 --> 00:17:17,041
I'm gonna talk to him. Don't worry,
I'll be on my best behavior.

347
00:17:17,388 --> 00:17:20,292
Fine.
670 south main, penthouse.

348
00:17:20,412 --> 00:17:22,193
Thank you,
as always.

349
00:17:23,528 --> 00:17:26,423
Well, that was quick.
Either he couldn't close

350
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:29,093
or the sheer physics of the act
was too overwhelming.

351
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:32,873
Actually, I've been trying to figure out
how it would line up.

352
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,380
So I was right?
She was into you?

353
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,477
No, you weren't right. She's an actress,
thought I could help manage her.

354
00:17:39,597 --> 00:17:41,438
- Thank God.
- You're happy about that?

355
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:44,141
If I can't fuck a model today,
nobody should.

356
00:17:44,453 --> 00:17:46,164
You're a real team player.

357
00:17:46,284 --> 00:17:47,586
- So can she act?
- No.

358
00:17:47,706 --> 00:17:49,848
- No model can.
- And she's a bitch.

359
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,657
She leans over me to talk to me.

360
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:53,158
She's taller than you.

361
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:55,898
You're taller than me too.
You don't lean over me.

362
00:17:56,018 --> 00:17:56,953
Sorry.

363
00:17:57,516 --> 00:17:59,456
- Poor E.
- Woe is E.

364
00:18:00,002 --> 00:18:02,832
- How did it go with Natasha?
- It's still going.

365
00:18:04,232 --> 00:18:05,796
No, hold it. You wait a minute.

366
00:18:05,956 --> 00:18:07,673
So what I'm hearing
from my own agent

367
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:10,718
is that you don't think I have
the acting chops to play Marcel Proust?

368
00:18:10,878 --> 00:18:12,547
What I'm saying is I don't think

369
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:15,185
that an audience is gonna buy you
as a gay frenchman.

370
00:18:15,305 --> 00:18:16,715
You know I speak French?

371
00:18:16,835 --> 00:18:18,917
I meant it
as a compliment.

372
00:18:19,037 --> 00:18:21,720
- It didn't feel like one.
- Excuse me, Jeffrey Tambor.

373
00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:24,148
Apology not accepted.
Ari, listen to me.

374
00:18:24,308 --> 00:18:26,560
Take a breath.
Please, Lloyd, tell me that someone

375
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,986
hit my dog with a car
and I have to get out of here.

376
00:18:29,106 --> 00:18:31,359
Your wife is on the phone
and wants to know why

377
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:34,439
you sent over a set of Louis Vuitton
luggage and quite frankly so do I.

378
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,711
- He'll call back.
- Hold on, Jeffrey, just--

379
00:18:36,831 --> 00:18:39,288
- Sorry to interrupt. Hello, Jeffrey.
- Barbara.

380
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:41,665
You know what? I'll call her back.

381
00:18:41,785 --> 00:18:44,247
- I got a really important meeting.
- How long do you need him?

382
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:45,586
- Not long.
- Long.

383
00:18:45,746 --> 00:18:48,464
- I'll wait. Hey, take notes.
- Just say hello quickly.

384
00:18:48,624 --> 00:18:50,299
Just say hello quickly.

385
00:18:50,459 --> 00:18:52,717
There's the man.
We know your time is precious.

386
00:18:52,837 --> 00:18:54,586
Not for talented people like you.

387
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:56,805
I hear you want
to make the jump into features.

388
00:18:56,965 --> 00:18:58,890
We want to write something
for Peter Jackson.

389
00:18:59,965 --> 00:19:01,727
He usually writes his own stuff.

390
00:19:01,947 --> 00:19:03,334
We have a take on <i>The Hobbit</i>.

391
00:19:03,454 --> 00:19:05,773
We want to make him a giant.
I'm kidding.

392
00:19:05,933 --> 00:19:09,102
- Seriously, we have a take.
- He wrote all three <i>Lord of the Rings</i>.

393
00:19:09,222 --> 00:19:11,169
So I think he's gonna
want to write that.

394
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:12,671
Maybe, maybe not.

395
00:19:12,925 --> 00:19:15,351
Okay. Well,
do you have a sample?

396
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:16,391
We do.

397
00:19:19,846 --> 00:19:22,080
- It's <i>The Hobbit</i>.
- We did it on spec.

398
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:26,043
- We don't want to just send it to him.
- We want to present it face to face.

399
00:19:26,295 --> 00:19:28,390
- He's in New Zealand.
- We have a plane.

400
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,361
We just got it.
You can come.

401
00:19:32,948 --> 00:19:34,760
I have to go to the bathroom.

402
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,114
Can we just give you the quick pitch?
It's very short.

403
00:19:37,234 --> 00:19:39,397
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Ari, sit.

404
00:19:39,517 --> 00:19:41,350
- Ari, stay.
- The whole thing's a metaphor.

405
00:19:41,593 --> 00:19:42,849
I speak French.

406
00:19:45,424 --> 00:19:47,200
- Where are you going?
- To the bathroom.

407
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,140
- Bathroom's the other way.
- Honey, listen.

408
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,236
Pack those bags.
We're going to Geneva tonight.

409
00:19:52,396 --> 00:19:54,532
- Vive la France!
- Geneva?

410
00:19:54,725 --> 00:19:57,515
What is gog on?
What should I tell Jeffrey?

411
00:19:57,635 --> 00:19:59,060
I don't give a fuck.

412
00:20:00,173 --> 00:20:03,097
Vinnie, I think it's really sweet how
concerned you are about the campaign,

413
00:20:03,217 --> 00:20:05,449
but it doesn't matter who the model is.
She's decoration.

414
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:07,621
You're the money. You're the brand.
Want a drink?

415
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:10,495
Yeah, I just thought
we had really great chemistry.

416
00:20:10,672 --> 00:20:12,665
I'm not sure I really felt it
with this other girl.

417
00:20:12,785 --> 00:20:14,289
Let's dump her.
Know what I mean?

418
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:16,499
You can choose whoever you want.
I'll get you a book.

419
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:18,727
I think your instincts
were right the first time.

420
00:20:18,847 --> 00:20:21,846
- We should go with Natasha.
- What are we gonna do? She quit.

421
00:20:22,564 --> 00:20:23,430
Really?

422
00:20:24,471 --> 00:20:25,424
Did she?

423
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:28,825
Why, what did she tell you?

424
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:32,183
All right, fuck it.

425
00:20:32,984 --> 00:20:35,070
I fired her.
She lied to me.

426
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,656
She never told me when I booked her
that she knew you.

427
00:20:37,816 --> 00:20:40,603
We don't really know each other.
We shared a plane ride together.

428
00:20:40,723 --> 00:20:42,487
So why do you give a fuck?

429
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:44,782
- It's a principle thing.
- What principle?

430
00:20:44,902 --> 00:20:47,100
I'm paying you a fortune
to do the photo shoot.

431
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:51,162
Don't blow this between you and me.
I've got big plans for you.

432
00:20:51,506 --> 00:20:53,171
Freddy, I am a professional.

433
00:20:53,331 --> 00:20:55,159
This don't seem too professional to me.

434
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:57,676
And firing a girl because
she doesn't want you is?

435
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:02,389
Because she doesn't want me?
Is that what you think?

436
00:21:02,689 --> 00:21:03,891
Do you think she does?

437
00:21:04,051 --> 00:21:06,719
Of course she wants me.
They all want me. Look at me.

438
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:08,145
I don't want her.

439
00:21:08,415 --> 00:21:09,855
No? Then what do you want?

440
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,274
I want you,
you beautiful boy.

441
00:21:14,114 --> 00:21:16,042
Look, I didn't know you had a history.

442
00:21:16,162 --> 00:21:18,245
No, I'll compete with all the other

443
00:21:18,657 --> 00:21:22,117
anorexic empty spaces,
but I can't compete with history.

444
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,202
Freddy, there's no competition.

445
00:21:26,306 --> 00:21:27,454
I'm not gay.

446
00:21:28,072 --> 00:21:29,207
I'm not even bi.

447
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:32,711
I'm just a straight man
that likes sucking cock.

448
00:21:34,165 --> 00:21:35,547
No one's gonna know.

449
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,247
Well--

450
00:21:41,213 --> 00:21:43,736
I guess I'm just not cut out
for the fashion world.

451
00:21:43,856 --> 00:21:46,596
Forget it. That whole
world is deviants, bro.

452
00:21:46,716 --> 00:21:48,694
The dudes bang each other
while the chicks watch.

453
00:21:48,814 --> 00:21:51,192
The chicks bang each other
while more chicks watch.

454
00:21:51,312 --> 00:21:53,271
And yet nobody
would let you watch anything.

455
00:21:53,391 --> 00:21:54,734
Pick on me all you want,

456
00:21:54,854 --> 00:21:57,569
but you never and shall
forever never get what I've had.

457
00:21:57,918 --> 00:21:58,925
Herpes?

458
00:21:59,493 --> 00:22:01,226
My dick is clean, tiny man.

459
00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:05,788
Hold on, hold on.
I'm getting a call. Chill out.

460
00:22:08,642 --> 00:22:09,920
I got your message.

461
00:22:10,617 --> 00:22:12,651
 I wanted to say
I'm sorry about the campaign.

462
00:22:12,771 --> 00:22:16,380
That shit happens all the time.
Are you gonna be okay without me?

463
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,223
It's funny you should ask.

464
00:22:18,852 --> 00:22:21,410
- I couldn't face it alone so I quit.
- <i>Really</i>?

465
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:25,973
If you have some free time why don't you
join me to Hawaii for my shoot?

466
00:22:26,503 --> 00:22:28,433
<i>We've plenty of space on the plane.</i>

467
00:22:28,553 --> 00:22:30,060
You got room for four?

468
00:22:30,455 --> 00:22:33,105
For sure.
And maybe bring your manager.

469
00:22:33,265 --> 00:22:36,012
- <i>I have a special request for him</i>.
- Great.

470
00:22:36,132 --> 00:22:39,111
So Van Nuys airport tonight.
I'll text you.

471
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,834
- See you there.
- What's up?

472
00:22:40,954 --> 00:22:42,930
Models models
and more models.

473
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:46,201
- I don't follow.
- Oh, but you will. You will.

474
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:51,323
Why have I never heard
Dana's name before?

475
00:22:51,443 --> 00:22:54,626
Because it was 1990
and you were dating Jack Wagner.

476
00:22:56,681 --> 00:22:57,930
I don't think I could live

477
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,724
with having someone work for you
that you had sex with.

478
00:23:01,022 --> 00:23:02,592
Could you live with that?

479
00:23:07,716 --> 00:23:09,641
- Is Vince coming with us?
- What?

480
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:12,353
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck is he doing here?

481
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,640
- Look at this power couple.
- Hey, there he is.

482
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,457
Good to see you, sir.
How are you?

483
00:23:25,577 --> 00:23:27,144
- Hello, John.
- You look beautiful.

484
00:23:27,264 --> 00:23:29,613
Thank you for the lovely vacation.
Kate, hi.

485
00:23:29,932 --> 00:23:31,362
- Shall we?
- Yes, we shall.

486
00:23:32,553 --> 00:23:34,860
- Can you just give me one quick second?
- Sure.

487
00:23:39,105 --> 00:23:40,946
- Small world?
- What are you doing here?

488
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:43,913
- Listen, we are taking a little trip.
- Yeah, us too.

489
00:23:44,377 --> 00:23:46,693
I can see that you're saving money
by flying private again.

490
00:23:46,813 --> 00:23:48,180
Not our dime.
It's theirs.

491
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:51,735
Nice dime.

492
00:23:52,257 --> 00:23:53,852
- Where are you headed?
- To Geneva.

493
00:23:54,012 --> 00:23:55,620
That's Alan's boss right there.

494
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,862
You're going to Geneva for me?

495
00:24:01,258 --> 00:24:03,562
- Something wrong?
- Yeah, listen, Vinnie.

496
00:24:03,682 --> 00:24:06,646
You're the only one in this town
that I'm telling this to.

497
00:24:06,766 --> 00:24:09,547
I'm in a position to get you
any job that we want

498
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:11,496
for the rest of your career.

499
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:13,104
How so?

500
00:24:13,224 --> 00:24:16,417
They're offering me Alan's position.
They want me to run the studio.

501
00:24:18,695 --> 00:24:20,804
It just came out of the blue.
What do you think?

502
00:24:21,498 --> 00:24:22,949
I just--
I mean I--

503
00:24:23,468 --> 00:24:26,051
I think I'd like us to finish
what we started together,

504
00:24:27,337 --> 00:24:29,771
but I think you gotta do
what you gotta do, right?

505
00:24:29,891 --> 00:24:31,289
What are you thinking?

506
00:24:31,867 --> 00:24:33,232
I'm thinking...

507
00:24:34,979 --> 00:24:37,401
I don't know.
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

508
00:24:38,265 --> 00:24:39,731
I'll tell you that much.

509
00:24:46,022 --> 00:24:47,790
- Have a good trip.
- You too.

510
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:49,215
All right.

511
00:24:55,631 --> 00:24:56,649
What's up?

512
00:24:57,575 --> 00:24:59,751
They just offered Ari
the studio head position.

513
00:24:59,871 --> 00:25:01,086
Is he gonna take it?

514
00:25:06,008 --> 00:25:07,286
What's up, bro?

515
00:25:11,381 --> 00:25:13,707
I figure we could just
pick up where we left off.

516
00:25:15,378 --> 00:25:17,306
There are more girls coming, right?

517
00:25:17,426 --> 00:25:19,855
- Don't worry. Any second.
- They better be good looking.

518
00:25:22,136 --> 00:25:25,364
You're so lucky. I get so claustrophobic
and cramped on these flights.

519
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:27,141
- Will you stop it, Raina?
- What?

520
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:29,147
Because I'm not that small,
that's why.

521
00:25:29,267 --> 00:25:31,402
Did I hurt your feelings?
I'm just teasing you.

522
00:25:31,522 --> 00:25:33,518
It's not a very smart way
to get a manager.

523
00:25:33,638 --> 00:25:35,027
I want a manager.

524
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:37,067
But I need a spinner.

525
00:25:38,283 --> 00:25:40,234
Did she just call him a spinner?

526
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,628
Hello, ladies.

527
00:25:43,788 --> 00:25:45,327
Hey, now we're talking.

528
00:25:46,702 --> 00:25:48,651
Hey, how are you?
Who needs a drink?

529
00:25:48,865 --> 00:25:49,883
Drinks?

530
00:25:51,796 --> 00:25:55,308
So who's ready
for five hours of captivity?

531
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,373
Drinks all around?

532
00:26:00,553 --> 00:26:02,247
Are you all right, Vince?

533
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:03,932
How could I be better?
