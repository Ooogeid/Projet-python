1
00:01:23,956 --> 00:01:26,210
- Last night was fun.
- Yeah yeah.

2
00:01:26,257 --> 00:01:29,849
- Do it again tonight?
- Sure. I'll call you later.

3
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,024
I'll call you later.

4
00:01:42,563 --> 00:01:44,347
How pathetic are you guys?

5
00:01:44,418 --> 00:01:46,473
Pathetic, us?!

6
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:48,539
Who tells a
first date that they love her?

7
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,089
Oh yeah, right. I told
her that i loved her.

8
00:01:50,148 --> 00:01:52,572
- Looked like you were gonna tell her you loved her.
- My point exactly.

9
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,662
- Whatever - Aw, e, thess
are just bitter

10
00:01:54,692 --> 00:01:56,559
- 'Cause you're on a hot streak.
- Thanks, vince.

11
00:01:56,594 --> 00:01:59,682
Guy's got more pussy the last
month than the previous 29 years,

12
00:01:59,735 --> 00:02:02,494
I wouldn't call it a hot streak, i'd
call it entering the twilight zone.

13
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,819
That's what being a successful
manager does for you.

14
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:06,990
So you're saying it has
nothing to do with him,

15
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,133
- Just the business card?
- Yep!

16
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:11,481
Ah, now i get it.

17
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:13,283
So you've been banging
all these dates, e?

18
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:15,243
<i>E don't bang them
that quickly.</i>

19
00:02:15,296 --> 00:02:17,538
E needs to be wined and
dined for at least a month.

20
00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:19,852
Oh no no no! I think i
heard banging last night.

21
00:02:19,887 --> 00:02:21,625
<i>- Was there banging, e?
- Turtle: well?</i>

22
00:02:21,854 --> 00:02:23,010
Was there banging?

23
00:02:23,057 --> 00:02:24,865
Can we talk about important stuff, please?

24
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,261
All right, what do you
have on your mind?

25
00:02:28,088 --> 00:02:29,110
Are you nervous?

26
00:02:29,157 --> 00:02:31,881
When you're prepared, there's no need to be nervous.

27
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:33,977
- It's just a driving test.
- I'm talking about leno.

28
00:02:34,253 --> 00:02:35,838
I'm more nervous
about the driving test.

29
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:37,652
Don't take e's
aston martin then.

30
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:40,118
Those pricks give you points
off just for having a fancy car.

31
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:43,535
- Leno, vince. What are you gonna talk about?
- I'm open for suggestions.

32
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:46,059
I've never been invited on,
so i wouldn't have any.

33
00:02:46,423 --> 00:02:48,830
Just tell the world how
sick the movie's gonna be.

34
00:02:48,906 --> 00:02:51,396
No, the clip'll say that. He needs
something that'll make a statement.

35
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:53,662
Like when crispin glover
kicked letterman in the head?

36
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,474
- Not that kind of statement.
- Besides, i'm not that limber.

37
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,255
Tell him about how
you let those two girls

38
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,507
Believe that they convinced you
to have a threesome last week.

39
00:03:00,554 --> 00:03:03,601
- I don't think that's gonna fly either, turtle.
- I'll save it for conan.

40
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:06,425
Who's that?

41
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:08,650
Oh, you have to be
kidding me. Who is that!?

42
00:03:08,744 --> 00:03:10,112
- Get back here.
- Yeah, get back here!

43
00:03:10,147 --> 00:03:12,836
- Hello?
- Hey, e, it's sloan.

44
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,601
Get back here,
you miniature stud!

45
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,644
Sorry about that.

46
00:03:17,715 --> 00:03:20,720
Glad to see that fame and success
hasn't changed much over there.

47
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:22,680
<i>- Yeah, nothing's changed.
- Good to hear.</i>

48
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,237
<i>- So what's up?
- It just so happens that a friend of mine</i>

49
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:28,438
Desperately needs to sublet her
house to someone and i thought of you.

50
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,251
Is that what it takes to get a call from youhese days?

51
00:03:30,298 --> 00:03:32,623
<i>- Phone works both ways.
- I left you a message.</i>

52
00:03:32,658 --> 00:03:34,232
<i>I didn't get a message.</i>

53
00:03:36,287 --> 00:03:40,690
E, i'm calling you now because i
thought of you when she brought this up.

54
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:43,261
<i>- Why? I'm not even looking.
- I heard that you looked at a place</i>

55
00:03:43,262 --> 00:03:45,316
On crescent
a couple months back.

56
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:47,782
<i>- Ah, keeping tabs on me, huh?
- For some reason</i>

57
00:03:47,817 --> 00:03:50,351
<i>My friends think i'm still
interested in your whereabouts.</i>

58
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:53,465
- But you're not?
- E, do you want to look at this house?

59
00:03:53,515 --> 00:03:55,311
<i>It's unbelievable.</i>

60
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:59,004
Yeah, sure.

61
00:04:02,035 --> 00:04:03,325
Morning, ari.
How are you?

62
00:04:03,384 --> 00:04:05,140
My girl won her debate
on friday,

63
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,436
My boy scored a goal
in soccer on saturday

64
00:04:07,446 --> 00:04:09,867
And my wife agreed to visit
her mother without me.

65
00:04:09,877 --> 00:04:11,780
- I don't know how things could get much better.
- Ari.

66
00:04:11,814 --> 00:04:13,928
- Give me something good, andrew.
- Greg garcia good?

67
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:15,842
You signed him? I thought
he was happy where he was?

68
00:04:15,877 --> 00:04:17,709
Until i convinced him he'd be happier here.

69
00:04:17,756 --> 00:04:19,352
You hear that, everybody?

70
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,617
"My name is earl" is now a
member of the miller gold family.

71
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:25,427
Mr. Andrew klein
is responsible for that.

72
00:04:25,552 --> 00:04:27,997
Which means that
in this horrific economy

73
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:31,094
He has secured himself a future.
All of you can do that as well

74
00:04:31,165 --> 00:04:34,881
If you go out there and sign someone
who can syndicate a goddamned show.

75
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,059
- Vinnie's doing leno. You want to come?
- Love to.

76
00:04:37,106 --> 00:04:38,245
All right.

77
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:41,487
- What's all the yelling about?
- Oh, didn't you hear?

78
00:04:41,522 --> 00:04:43,365
Andrew just signed another show runner.

79
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,974
Oh, i did. Very impressive.

80
00:04:45,027 --> 00:04:47,481
So you either owe me an apology or a blowjob.

81
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:49,389
- Your choice.
- Oh, okay, ari.

82
00:04:49,448 --> 00:04:52,372
I apologize. But i think
andrew should blow you.

83
00:04:52,454 --> 00:04:55,025
You said he was a deadbeat.
The only one sucking is you.

84
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:57,914
All is well with
the miller gold agency!

85
00:04:57,972 --> 00:04:59,945
- Well, not all.
- What's your problem?

86
00:05:00,192 --> 00:05:01,929
I had dinner with
my parents last night

87
00:05:01,971 --> 00:05:04,425
<i>- And my father spent the entire
meal reaming me out.</i>

88
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,274
You never told him
you liked dick?

89
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,293
- He knew that by the time i was nine.
- I'm not following you.

90
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,984
But the phone is ringing.

91
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,391
I need to talk to you
about my... career.

92
00:05:15,438 --> 00:05:17,528
The career that you won't have
if you don't answer the phone?

93
00:05:17,587 --> 00:05:20,170
Ari, i will handle the
phone. Please, i need to talk.

94
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:21,650
So talk.

95
00:05:22,216 --> 00:05:23,810
I'm so glad you're in a good mood.

96
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:26,311
<i>- Who says i'm in a good mood?
- You just did!</i>

97
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,642
You just yelled "all is well
at the miller gold agency."

98
00:05:28,674 --> 00:05:31,744
- That was an act to boost morale.
- Well, what's wrong?

99
00:05:31,856 --> 00:05:35,296
- What's right? Have you seen my stock portfolio, lloyd?
- No.

100
00:05:35,343 --> 00:05:37,785
And i shot
an 82 yesterday, lloyd.

101
00:05:37,844 --> 00:05:41,190
An 82! I missed three putts
from inside eight feet.

102
00:05:41,331 --> 00:05:43,726
Can you imagine missing
a hole from that close?

103
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:47,578
If i lose the club championship to
chervin i will sue butch harmon's ass.

104
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:48,987
- Ari!
- Yes, lloyd, yes?

105
00:05:49,045 --> 00:05:50,701
I want a promotion!

106
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:54,658
- You do?
- I've been on your desk over three years.

107
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:57,535
- I've paid my dues.
- Is this about your father?

108
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,353
Did you know that my father
was very strict?

109
00:06:00,435 --> 00:06:03,381
- No.
- Yeah. He berated me and he pushed me

110
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,678
And he insulted me
and it made me feel
very insecure and lost.

111
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:09,927
But i became a man-
My own man.

112
00:06:10,015 --> 00:06:12,445
And now i berate
and i push.

113
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,688
- I have noticed.
- Make your own man, lloyd.

114
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,614
- I'm trying.
- Not trying hard enough! The goddamn phone is ringing.

115
00:06:16,637 --> 00:06:19,596
But, ari, we haven't
even really talked.

116
00:06:19,643 --> 00:06:22,015
I talked! And my hope
is that you listened.

117
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,207
Go!

118
00:06:27,545 --> 00:06:29,242
No, cut it
- Cut it left. Left.

119
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,496
- Why aren't we using cones?
- Don't talk to him, drama!

120
00:06:31,543 --> 00:06:34,625
- Let him concentrate.
- I got it, guys. I got it.

121
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,735
<i>Now ease it in there.</i>

122
00:06:41,054 --> 00:06:43,133
- Sorry, e.
- That's okay.

123
00:06:43,421 --> 00:06:45,531
I'll get you
a new one.

124
00:06:45,597 --> 00:06:46,949
Don't worry about it.
Ahem.

125
00:06:47,005 --> 00:06:49,213
All right,
you're almost there.

126
00:06:52,658 --> 00:06:54,394
There you go.

127
00:06:56,112 --> 00:06:58,597
Okay, i think
you're ready.

128
00:07:00,016 --> 00:07:01,751
All right, everyone in!
Let's go!

129
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:04,024
Oh, st. Christopher,
please protect us.

130
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:07,390
- I'm gonna meet you guys over there.
- What? Really?

131
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,303
<i>- What's the big deal?
- Vince: nothing, i guess.</i>

132
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:13,862
What do you have to do that's more
important than watching me get my license?

133
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:17,750
I'm just gonna meet sloan
for a coffee.

134
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:22,088
- Was that sloan that called this morning?
- Yeah.

135
00:07:22,188 --> 00:07:24,486
- You didn't tell us.
- I don't tell you everything.

136
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:26,793
<i>Well, you tell me
everything.</i>

137
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:29,054
Something's up.

138
00:07:29,176 --> 00:07:30,697
- Definitely.
- Yeah, what's up, e?

139
00:07:30,797 --> 00:07:33,632
Nothing's up.
It's a coffee.

140
00:07:35,982 --> 00:07:39,572
20 years in this business, i don't
think i've had a sip in the office.

141
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:43,974
Well, when the king of karma sends
over a $1200 bottle of scotch, you should drink it.

142
00:07:44,094 --> 00:07:46,513
This worked out better than i thought it would. Cheers.

143
00:07:46,613 --> 00:07:48,798
- Amen.
- You're drinking in the middle of the day?

144
00:07:48,898 --> 00:07:52,370
They do it on "mad men" all the
time and they're pretty successful.

145
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,751
That was in the '60s.

146
00:07:53,787 --> 00:07:55,855
By the time they get to
season four in the '70s,

147
00:07:55,955 --> 00:07:58,053
- They'll all have liver and heart disease.
- Not us.

148
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,061
- This tandem is unstoppable.
- This new team is thriving.

149
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:03,930
- Glad to see somebody is.
- What, are you sulking, lloyd?

150
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,367
No! I'm steaming. Steaming mad because
i tried to talk with you earlier

151
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:09,152
And you essentially
ignored me.

152
00:08:09,252 --> 00:08:11,254
<i>- Are we not in a meeting?
- I don't know what you're in,</i>

153
00:08:11,354 --> 00:08:14,156
- But you're acting like you're in a bar.
- I don't like your tone, lloyd.

154
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,377
- Do you have any plan to promote me?
- Hadn't even thought about it.

155
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:19,062
<i>- Well, you need to.
- Lloyd!</i>

156
00:08:19,162 --> 00:08:21,631
Ari, promote me
or i'm leaving you!

157
00:08:21,731 --> 00:08:23,799
Leaving me?

158
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,921
- Where would you go?
- To another agency.

159
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:30,123
Another agency? You'd have
to start all over again.

160
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:32,192
- You know that.
- Then i'll go work for my father.

161
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:35,311
- What, in a dry-Cleaner's? -
My father has a winery in napa.

162
00:08:35,411 --> 00:08:37,646
I don't think sodomy
is legal in napa, lloyd.

163
00:08:39,349 --> 00:08:42,185
Every time i have broached
this subject over the years

164
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:44,683
You have responded
with some wiseass comment.

165
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:49,025
The time has come. I want to
know if this is going to happen.

166
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:52,713
I want to know when
and i want to know today!

167
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,272
<i>I will not be
strong-Armed, lloyd.</i>

168
00:08:55,337 --> 00:08:58,050
You just were,
ari gold.

169
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,425
Tough queer.

170
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:07,627
Wow, this is amazing.

171
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:09,849
- I told you.
- And why is it so cheap?

172
00:09:09,952 --> 00:09:12,048
Because my girlfriend is
moving to vancouver for a year

173
00:09:12,148 --> 00:09:14,751
And she just wanted someone
she trusts to take care of it.

174
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:17,337
- Oh yeah? She trusts me?
- Well, she trusts me

175
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:20,056
- And i told her she can trust you.
- This her?

176
00:09:20,156 --> 00:09:22,702
<i>- Uh-Huh.
- Ugly.</i>

177
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:25,531
- So what do you think?
- I don't know.

178
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,425
I really haven't been
looking around much.

179
00:09:27,491 --> 00:09:29,599
Just trying to get an idea
what's out there, you know?

180
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:32,202
This isn't out there. This
is a fluke opportunity.

181
00:09:32,302 --> 00:09:35,616
- I appreciate that.
- Okay. I won't push.

182
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:39,025
I know what a big deal it is for you
to be out on your own without the boys.

183
00:09:39,128 --> 00:09:40,511
It's not a big deal.

184
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,244
- And you hate change.
- I don't hate change.

185
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,619
E, you moved back
into your old house.

186
00:09:45,665 --> 00:09:47,784
That was vince's idea.

187
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:51,054
- Does he even know you're here?
- He knows i'm with you.

188
00:09:51,154 --> 00:09:53,188
He thinks
we're having coffee.

189
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:57,961
You know, look, vince is doing
amazing. The house is great.

190
00:09:58,061 --> 00:10:01,264
He signed a two-Year lease thinking
we were all going to live in it, so.

191
00:10:01,364 --> 00:10:03,299
Well, thanks to you
he can afford it.

192
00:10:03,315 --> 00:10:06,309
I sunk so much money into my business,
do i really need my own place?

193
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:08,504
At your age,
you kinda do.

194
00:10:09,152 --> 00:10:10,686
If i was in a relationship...

195
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,809
Oh, e, we've talked
about this.

196
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:16,462
You're not going to be in a relationship
so long as you're living in a frat house.

197
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:20,167
We always do pick up right
where we left off, don't we?

198
00:10:20,383 --> 00:10:23,216
- So how is dating life?
- What?

199
00:10:23,676 --> 00:10:25,388
Oh, let's not get
weird about this.

200
00:10:25,488 --> 00:10:28,825
You're dating, i'm dating,
we can talk about it.

201
00:10:28,925 --> 00:10:31,528
Wow, you really are
keeping tabs on me, huh?

202
00:10:31,628 --> 00:10:34,797
I'm really not. But i was
forced to hear about you

203
00:10:34,897 --> 00:10:37,467
Stumbling out of fox hill
with a pretty young girl.

204
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:39,619
And i was forced to hear
about you making out

205
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:41,487
With a pretty old dude
at dan tana's.

206
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:44,040
Oh, who's keeping tabs?
And you know me-

207
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,827
- I don't make out in public.
- I don't want to talk about this anymore.

208
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:50,463
I do. Who's the girl?

209
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:54,182
- Girls-Ss. - Oh,
multiple girls! Wow, e.

210
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:57,435
It's so unlike you.
Maybe you are maturing.

211
00:10:57,566 --> 00:10:58,975
Would you stop?

212
00:11:00,492 --> 00:11:02,308
- I gotta go.
- What should i tell my friend?

213
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:04,077
- Tell her i'll think about it.
- Okay.

214
00:11:04,177 --> 00:11:06,346
- See you later.
- Ciao.

215
00:11:07,282 --> 00:11:08,964
<i>Make a right here.</i>

216
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:14,970
<i>- And i need you to make a left here.
- All right.</i>

217
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:21,978
- Very nice.
- Thanks, i've been working on that one.

218
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:27,734
I'm excited about your new film.
"Gatsby" is one of my favorites.

219
00:11:27,763 --> 00:11:29,552
Oh, i hope i don't
ruin it for you.

220
00:11:29,652 --> 00:11:32,372
Oh no, the trailer
looked great.

221
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,748
Love scorsese. Let's do a
three-Point turn right here.

222
00:11:36,874 --> 00:11:38,260
Okay.

223
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,570
He's awful.

224
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:51,107
- Don't hit that! Oh! Look at that.
- How's he doing?

225
00:11:51,207 --> 00:11:53,412
- Bro's bumming.
- You were supposed to get him ready.

226
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:56,528
I did
- For the written. Even i couldn't get him roadworthy.

227
00:11:56,571 --> 00:11:58,396
He's gonna show up on set, he's
not gonna know how to drive.

228
00:11:58,414 --> 00:12:00,333
Hey've got stunt doubles for that.

229
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:02,681
<i>Making him get his license
is for insurance purposes.</i>

230
00:12:02,728 --> 00:12:05,911
He's playing enzo ferrari. He
needs to know how to drive a car.

231
00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:08,474
- Oh!
- Oh my goodness.

232
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,711
So?

233
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:18,164
I'm finally
an independent.

234
00:12:18,185 --> 00:12:19,888
- You passed?
- No way! Really?

235
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:20,958
Yes!

236
00:12:21,014 --> 00:12:23,687
Thanks so much, scott. See you at the premiere?

237
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,044
- Plus one, right?
- You know it.

238
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:28,085
Shall we?

239
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:29,869
He passed you for premiere tickets?

240
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,829
Why, cheryl walters
let me go in the back door

241
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:36,197
- For "young guns 3-D" tickets.
- Oh, you're disgusting.

242
00:12:36,312 --> 00:12:38,349
<i>- Vince: so how's sloan?
- What do you mean?</i>

243
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:40,550
- I mean how is she?
- Oh, she's good.

244
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:42,438
Was that
a weird question?

245
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:44,941
- No.
- 'Cause you sure answered it kinda weird.

246
00:12:44,976 --> 00:12:47,226
- Did i?
- Yeah. Didn't he?

247
00:12:47,427 --> 00:12:49,127
- Turtle: yeah.
- Kinda weird.

248
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:51,229
- You're getting back together with sloan...
- No.

249
00:12:51,264 --> 00:12:54,886
- ... After once cup of coffee?
- You're back in love with sloan?

250
00:12:54,921 --> 00:12:57,916
- No.
- One cup of coffee's all it takes for this guy!

251
00:12:57,951 --> 00:12:59,570
- Look, it was a friendly meeting.
- Ahh!

252
00:12:59,605 --> 00:13:02,182
- Vince: a meeting?
- Turtle: a meeting which she called for.

253
00:13:02,217 --> 00:13:05,406
It's all the girls he's been
getting. Pussy can smell other pussy

254
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:06,987
And then they have
to pounce on it.

255
00:13:07,022 --> 00:13:10,060
That's why when you're on a hot streak,
you've got to press it like blackjack.

256
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:11,794
Are you pressing it
with sloan?

257
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:14,118
I'm done with this conversation.
I'll see you guys at leno.

258
00:13:14,153 --> 00:13:15,236
- I'm riding with e.
- I'm gonna roll with you.

259
00:13:15,271 --> 00:13:17,921
No no no, forget that.
Come with me.

260
00:13:18,104 --> 00:13:20,754
- My car is here.
- We'll get it later.

261
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,844
Can we drive
with the airbags deployed?

262
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,982
Back in the day you waited
until your boss told you

263
00:13:36,017 --> 00:13:38,584
You are ready for a promotion.
You didn't threaten him.

264
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:41,962
I was on terrence's desk 50 months
before he finally promoted me.

265
00:13:41,997 --> 00:13:44,935
- And you ever threaten him?
- The man's a psychopath. Of course i didn't.

266
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,222
Lloyd thinks we're friends.
I'm too nice to him.

267
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:49,588
That's why you can never
be nice to an assistant.

268
00:13:49,623 --> 00:13:52,540
- The fuck i am.
- You think lloyd would make a good agent?

269
00:13:52,575 --> 00:13:54,675
I don't know.
He's smart, but he's...

270
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,558
- He's soft and he's weak.
- But you love him as an assistant?

271
00:13:57,593 --> 00:14:00,584
The best ever. I had 14 in
the three years before him.

272
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:02,045
- But an agent- I don't!

273
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,372
Make sure you know.
I got a few i didn't promote

274
00:14:04,407 --> 00:14:06,992
Make it big off of my desk,
they still won't return my calls.

275
00:14:07,027 --> 00:14:09,086
- You think lloyd wouldn't return my calls?
- I don't know.

276
00:14:09,121 --> 00:14:11,582
- Ungrateful prick.
- Nice of you to show, ari.

277
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:15,396
Nice of you to drop the baby weight.
What, do you have like nine kids now?

278
00:14:15,494 --> 00:14:18,134
- Three, asshole.
- Really? Did you figure
out who the fathers are?

279
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:21,010
Don't take it out on me because you don't
have an excuse for those extra pounds.

280
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:23,329
I'm still at 6% body fat.

281
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:25,965
And still 94% full of shit.

282
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,719
Vinnie ready to make
this comeback complete?

283
00:14:27,754 --> 00:14:29,804
Wait wait wait!
No no no.

284
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:35,993
Wait wait wait!
No no no.

285
00:14:36,028 --> 00:14:37,788
No, that sounds
like a disaster.

286
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,919
- I probably hit three cones.
- But no people?

287
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:41,323
No, no people.
Just cones.

288
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:44,020
- So not a complete disaster?
- A little disaster.

289
00:14:44,055 --> 00:14:46,855
- The guy still passed you?
- Uh... yeah, but...

290
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:49,663
Keep it between us
- I bribed him with a couple premiere tickets.

291
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:51,099
Oh, come on!

292
00:14:51,413 --> 00:14:53,082
<i>No no, that's a great
trade for you.</i>

293
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:55,503
Don't you understand? You
don't know how to drive!

294
00:14:56,575 --> 00:14:59,565
Yeah, in fact if you see me,
i'd be cautious.

295
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,567
Now see? See, that's amazing.

296
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:03,800
Being a movie star,
you get out of all this.

297
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:07,125
The rest of us, we tv people, we
have to learn how to parallel park.

298
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,910
- Here here.
- That's why i took up the motorcycle.

299
00:15:09,945 --> 00:15:11,698
It's small,
it's maneuverable.

300
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:15,702
Plus i can try my jokes out in
biker bars. They're a great crowd.

301
00:15:15,737 --> 00:15:18,647
<i>No, they are.
They're a great crowd.</i>

302
00:15:18,682 --> 00:15:22,332
Tell me if i understand this. So
you didn't get your license till...

303
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:24,219
How old are you anyway?

304
00:15:24,254 --> 00:15:28,554
My mom couldn't afford
to get me a car growing up.

305
00:15:29,382 --> 00:15:32,725
<i>- Leno: so you were poor?
- Milk it, honey, milk it.</i>

306
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,839
- We were rich in love.
- Rich in love!

307
00:15:35,874 --> 00:15:36,937
<i>True dat!</i>

308
00:15:36,972 --> 00:15:38,334
Aw - He's doing great.
- He always does.

309
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:40,380
You can afford a driver.
Why even bother to learn?

310
00:15:40,415 --> 00:15:44,044
I usually have my boy turtle drive
me around, but i'm doing a new movie.

311
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,652
<i>- Leno: and what's that?
- You can still drive me around.</i>

312
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,672
It's the story of the
race-Car inventor enzo ferrari.

313
00:15:49,707 --> 00:15:52,052
That might be a good movie
to learn how to drive for.

314
00:15:52,087 --> 00:15:53,861
- I think so.
- I don't know anything about it.

315
00:15:53,896 --> 00:15:56,599
I'm just throwing it out there.
Let's talk about your current movie,

316
00:15:56,634 --> 00:15:58,707
Which i saw last night-
Scorsese's "gatsby."

317
00:15:58,742 --> 00:16:02,177
- Boy, i just thought it was brilliant.
- We have our great director

318
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:05,815
- To thank for that-
Martin scorsese.

319
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,050
Sloan? She's all
over you, huh?

320
00:16:09,948 --> 00:16:11,464
Pussy.

321
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:13,240
Hey, i can't really
talk right now.

322
00:16:13,275 --> 00:16:16,760
Okay okay, real quick. I swear
i'm not putting pressure on you.

323
00:16:16,795 --> 00:16:19,860
I just thought you should know my
girlfriend has someone else interested.

324
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,556
Look, i haven't really thought
about it or spoken to vince.

325
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:23,679
Oh, come on, e

326
00:16:23,714 --> 00:16:27,064
-I don't
want you to miss out on this.
-No pressure, huh?

327
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:29,349
Just a little.

328
00:16:29,384 --> 00:16:31,831
<i>- She wants to meet you.
- Sloan, i can't rush like this.</i>

329
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,616
Look, just come and meet her

330
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:36,713
So she can approve of you in
case you decide you want it later.

331
00:16:36,748 --> 00:16:38,855
<i>- Can i call you back in
a little bit? - Tick-Tock.</i>

332
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,075
<i>- Bye, sloan.
- Bye.</i>

333
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:43,813
- Vince, congratulations.
- Thank you.

334
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:46,249
Vincent chase, everybody.
Be right back with...

335
00:16:46,284 --> 00:16:48,034
Vinnie!

336
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:00,752
Ari: vinnie killed it!
He did indeed!

337
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:03,477
How about
we stop off to celebrate?
- Naw, i gotta go see the kids.

338
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:06,734
- Family man ari gold, huh?
- Come on.

339
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:09,090
<i>Yeah?</i>

340
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,155
What's going on
with lloyd?

341
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,704
<i>- What do you mean, baby?
- He called me.</i>

342
00:17:13,739 --> 00:17:16,891
<i>- He called you?
- Yes, and he sounded very upset.</i>

343
00:17:16,926 --> 00:17:19,413
He wanted to say how much he enjoyed
knowing me. What's wrong with him?

344
00:17:19,448 --> 00:17:22,269
- He- Lloyd is dying, baby.
- What?!

345
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:24,959
<i>- What's wrong with him, daddy?
- Nothing, buddy.</i>

346
00:17:24,994 --> 00:17:26,963
Baby, tell me when
i'm on speakerphone.

347
00:17:26,998 --> 00:17:28,919
- Did you fire lloyd, ari?
- No-

348
00:17:28,954 --> 00:17:29,985
<i>- Daddy, no!</i>

349
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,550
We love lloyd, daddy.

350
00:17:31,774 --> 00:17:33,317
Oooh, ruthless.

351
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,855
He's gonna make it-
With or without you.

352
00:17:40,027 --> 00:17:41,710
Does that make the comeback
complete or what?

353
00:17:41,745 --> 00:17:43,969
No, when he's got an oscar,
then it's complete.

354
00:17:43,991 --> 00:17:45,798
I'd just be happy
to avoid a razzie.

355
00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:47,698
There's nothing wrong
with a razzie, bro.

356
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,924
Drama's gonna go for the hat trick
if he ever gets another movie.

357
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:51,887
I only have
one razzie, asshole!

358
00:17:51,922 --> 00:17:54,244
- All right, i'll talk to you later.
- Who was that?

359
00:17:54,868 --> 00:17:56,500
- Would you leave me alone?
- Never.

360
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:58,935
<i>- Turtle: ever.
- Was it sloan again?</i>

361
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:02,873
- Another broad?
- None of your business.

362
00:18:02,908 --> 00:18:05,776
I'm making it my business. So
you better tell whoever that was

363
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:09,628
To invite a friend or i'm banging pots
and pans outside your door all night.

364
00:18:09,663 --> 00:18:12,704
You don't live here, drama. Which begs
the question, why are you always here?

365
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:14,482
Because isolation's overrated. Besides,

366
00:18:14,517 --> 00:18:16,642
Baby bro likes
having me here.

367
00:18:16,677 --> 00:18:18,133
I like having
you all around.

368
00:18:18,168 --> 00:18:20,241
I'll stay up and bang
pots and pans.

369
00:18:20,276 --> 00:18:22,209
Don't you have dinner
with jamie tonight?

370
00:18:22,244 --> 00:18:25,422
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna tell her you asked me to find a friend.

371
00:18:25,457 --> 00:18:27,011
Pffft!
I didn't.

372
00:18:27,046 --> 00:18:29,149
Don't!
Please don't.

373
00:18:29,184 --> 00:18:31,300
All right, enough with the harassing e,

374
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:33,765
What are the boys without
relationships doing tonight?

375
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,698
- I got a night shoot, bro.
- Yeah, and that was sloan.

376
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:41,964
We're gonna meet for
a drink. No big deal.

377
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,009
Ari gold's office.

378
00:18:56,655 --> 00:18:59,113
Be at my house
at 10:00 p.M.

379
00:18:59,976 --> 00:19:02,129
- Your house?
- Sit on the stoop,

380
00:19:02,164 --> 00:19:03,509
Don't ring the bell,

381
00:19:03,544 --> 00:19:06,387
Don't make any noise,
wait for me.

382
00:19:07,044 --> 00:19:08,894
Till when?

383
00:19:09,343 --> 00:19:10,541
Hello?

384
00:19:12,357 --> 00:19:14,657
- Hey, looking sharp!
- Oh, thanks.

385
00:19:15,474 --> 00:19:17,748
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm just gonna hang out for a bit.

386
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:20,483
- Maybe go for a spin.
- You're drinking!

387
00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:21,793
It's one beer.

388
00:19:21,923 --> 00:19:23,454
All right,
don't drive, please.

389
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:26,456
Okay, thanks, ma. You know
what? If you're so concerned,

390
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:28,692
Why don't you take a break from the
dating pool and come hang out with me?

391
00:19:28,727 --> 00:19:31,150
- It's not a date.
- Oh no, that's right.

392
00:19:31,185 --> 00:19:33,085
Have fun at your "meeting."

393
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,797
Actually, vince, i didn't
have coffee with sloan today.

394
00:19:36,832 --> 00:19:38,247
<i>- No?
- No. A friend of hers</i>

395
00:19:38,282 --> 00:19:40,717
Has a great house
that she wants to sublet.

396
00:19:40,752 --> 00:19:42,989
Why? Sloan's got a
great house, doesn't she?

397
00:19:43,024 --> 00:19:45,934
Yeah, well, it wouldn't be for
her. She thought i might want it.

398
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,455
Oh-Ho! That's why you've been
acting like a freak all day.

399
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,587
- I haven't been acting like a freak all day.
- Yeah.

400
00:19:52,622 --> 00:19:55,528
Yeah, you have. If you
want to get your own house,

401
00:19:55,563 --> 00:19:59,398
- Go ahead, get it.
- You don't have an opinion about that at all?

402
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:01,659
What opinion
would i have?

403
00:20:01,851 --> 00:20:05,179
Oh, come on, vince! You know
you don't like to be alone.

404
00:20:05,865 --> 00:20:07,509
<i>- I don't like to be alone?
- No!</i>

405
00:20:07,544 --> 00:20:09,426
How would you know?
You've never seen me alone.

406
00:20:09,461 --> 00:20:11,586
<i>Because you're always with me
because you can't be alone.</i>

407
00:20:11,621 --> 00:20:14,471
- Have you ever lived by yourself?
- Have you?

408
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:17,099
And the guest house
doesn't count.

409
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:18,825
Exactly!

410
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,024
Besides, i got turtle.

411
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,407
Rarely. I mean, he's usually at jamie's.

412
00:20:23,442 --> 00:20:25,962
Do you want to get
your own place or what?

413
00:20:25,997 --> 00:20:28,443
Well, yeah, i'd kinda like
to have a little privacy,

414
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:31,438
<i>Not have the peanut gallery
commenting on everything that i do.</i>

415
00:20:31,518 --> 00:20:34,241
Maybe you want to impress sloan a
little bit with your independence?

416
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,876
- It's not about sloan.
- Maybe a little.

417
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:40,383
Come on. Get your
place, e. I'll be fine.

418
00:20:40,418 --> 00:20:42,826
- Don't worry about me.
- Are you sure?

419
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:45,217
- Positive.
- All right, i'll see you later.

420
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:47,896
- See ya.
- You know what, actually-

421
00:20:47,931 --> 00:20:50,927
Sloan's friend is really hot
if you want to roll with.

422
00:20:50,962 --> 00:20:51,962
Yeah?

423
00:20:52,828 --> 00:20:54,503
- I could do that.
- Yeah.

424
00:20:54,577 --> 00:20:56,401
We'll want to take
two cars just in case.

425
00:20:56,411 --> 00:20:59,354
<i>- In case what? In case you close?
- No, just in case you close.</i>

426
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:46,703
To little league, growing up
and moving out on his own.

427
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,816
- Thank you. Finally!
- Sloan: cheers.

428
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:51,692
Oaso, vince, are you going to blame me
when you're feeling all sad and lonely?

429
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:56,177
Why doesn't anybody think he'll be sad?
I'm really much more fun to be around.

430
00:21:56,203 --> 00:21:59,553
All right, you know what?
I'm usually not this pathetic,

431
00:21:59,724 --> 00:22:02,378
But since you took e,
i'm gonna have to take amy.

432
00:22:02,413 --> 00:22:05,387
- Interesting.
- Oh really? I am moving away for a year,

433
00:22:05,422 --> 00:22:08,827
And i'm not that interested in having
a one-Night fling with a movie star.

434
00:22:09,268 --> 00:22:10,518
Ouch!

435
00:22:10,726 --> 00:22:12,333
Wow.

436
00:22:12,412 --> 00:22:15,417
I'm just getting rejected
by everyone tonight, huh?

437
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:26,928
That's one thing i missed
about not having a license-

438
00:22:26,963 --> 00:22:29,370
I don't think
i've ever fucked in a car.

439
00:22:29,405 --> 00:22:32,393
I'm glad i could be
your first ride.

440
00:22:51,822 --> 00:22:54,165
You're a cruel man,
ari gold.

441
00:22:54,595 --> 00:22:58,039
You asked me for an answer by day's end. I
don't have an answer; i have a proposition.

442
00:22:58,074 --> 00:23:01,009
And if you don't like it, you
can wander off into the cold harsh

443
00:23:01,044 --> 00:23:03,614
<i>- Unforgiving world without me.
- What is it?</i>

444
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,376
100 days.

445
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:08,369
You survive,
you'll have your promotion.

446
00:23:08,404 --> 00:23:11,003
What is this, a hazing? This
is why i didn't join a frat.

447
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:12,696
- What frat would have you?
- Ari-

448
00:23:12,731 --> 00:23:13,815
Lloyd!

449
00:23:14,415 --> 00:23:18,439
100 days, you do
everything that i say,

450
00:23:18,806 --> 00:23:20,482
- Or you don't.
- Fine.

451
00:23:20,687 --> 00:23:23,193
You drop 15 lbs.

452
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,283
- You want me to drop 15 lbs?
- I'm asking that for tom.

453
00:23:26,318 --> 00:23:28,918
What i want will be much harder. Now go.

454
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,358
I'm gonna make it
through this, ari gold.

455
00:23:32,368 --> 00:23:36,957
It'll be worse than when you had your anal
cherry popped, but, hey, you just might.

456
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:45,765
It's true.

457
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,930
Oh, that was fun.
Thank you.

458
00:23:49,318 --> 00:23:51,139
- You're not gonna invite me in?
- No.

459
00:23:51,174 --> 00:23:53,106
- E, you're dating.

460
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:54,892
- So are you!
- Exactly.

461
00:23:55,338 --> 00:23:58,145
Look, i thought the whole reason you
were pushing me into this place-G.

462
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,381
Don't flatter yourself.

463
00:24:00,821 --> 00:24:01,821
Invite me in!

464
00:24:01,856 --> 00:24:03,734
E, you have girls-Ss.

465
00:24:03,983 --> 00:24:06,483
- That was a joke.
- It was a good one.

466
00:24:08,223 --> 00:24:09,824
Good night, eric.

467
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:11,989
Good night, sloan.

468
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,496
Hope i don't get too lonely
up in that house.

469
00:24:16,877 --> 00:24:19,027
Never lived alone
before.

470
00:24:19,173 --> 00:24:22,571
I mean, i lived with my mom up until
i lived with vince and the guys-

471
00:24:22,606 --> 00:24:25,289
- Oh, get a dog!
- Oh, so cold.

472
00:24:28,032 --> 00:24:29,961
Okay.
One drink.

473
00:24:30,724 --> 00:24:32,046
<i>Nothing more.</i>

474
00:24:32,415 --> 00:24:34,465
I'm serious.

475
00:24:35,001 --> 00:24:37,860
You didn't want to be vince's driver forever anyway, right?

476
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:39,269
No, of course i didn't.

477
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,525
It's just that vince is blowing up so fast
again

478
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,910
- I kinda got lost in what i'm doing.
- Oh, what are you doing?

479
00:24:46,256 --> 00:24:47,962
I got a couple of ideas.

480
00:24:48,226 --> 00:24:49,513
Wh are they?

481
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,398
No, not till
