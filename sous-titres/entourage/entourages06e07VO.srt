1
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:38,508
- I heard something.
- What?

2
00:01:39,482 --> 00:01:41,582
I think someone's in the house.

3
00:01:43,635 --> 00:01:44,635
Really?

4
00:01:47,267 --> 00:01:48,091
See?

5
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:50,493
All right, I'll go check it out.

6
00:01:52,456 --> 00:01:53,821
Ahnold, want to come with?

7
00:01:56,232 --> 00:01:57,332
Thanks, pal.

8
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:01,890
Hello?

9
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,327
Turtle, is that you?

10
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:19,520
Don't worry.
It's just the wind.

11
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:31,384
Call 911.

12
00:02:37,195 --> 00:02:38,799
Ahnold would have heard something.

13
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:41,771
I'm telling you, he didn't flinch.
Someone was definitely here.

14
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:43,625
If he didn't bark, they weren't.

15
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,456
- Maybe the girl set it up.
- Set what up?

16
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,744
Fantasy rape scene perhaps.

17
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,586
Is that what your girls do, Drama?

18
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,590
- Tie you up and strap one on?
- Don't be juvenile, E.

19
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,615
- Oh, christ.
- What is it?

20
00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:58,117
My half an agent.

21
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,720
Johnny Drama, what did you do?

22
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:03,766
- <i>It's not what I did.</i>
- You attacked a high-level studio exec.

23
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,076
- Is that what they're saying?
- <i>They're not</i>

24
00:03:06,201 --> 00:03:08,196
<i>except that you won't
be needed on set today.</i>

25
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,396
What? Why?

26
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,398
Because you attacked an exec.

27
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:14,401
- So now what? Am I done?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

28
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,195
I'll let you know when I hear more.

29
00:03:16,749 --> 00:03:17,949
Thanks, Lloyd.

30
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:22,889
They canceled my scenes today.

31
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:25,769
He said he was gonna have me written
off the show.

32
00:03:25,894 --> 00:03:29,317
- You're gonna have to apologize.
- He hits on my best friend's girlfriend

33
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,864
- and I'm supposed to apologize?
- You did grab him by the throat.

34
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:34,672
He said he was gonna pound
Meadow Soprano from behind.

35
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,966
You should've broken
his fucking arm.

36
00:03:38,104 --> 00:03:39,051
Sorry.

37
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,779
Drama, I appreciate 'cause I know
you had the best intentions.

38
00:03:42,904 --> 00:03:43,889
Jamie does too.

39
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:47,201
- But this is your job.
- Yeah, Johnny, you live for this show.

40
00:03:47,326 --> 00:03:49,144
Just suck it up and go talk to him.

41
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:55,542
Should I bring a fruit
basket or something?

42
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:57,570
Maybe a massage certificate
from Burke Williams?

43
00:04:00,051 --> 00:04:01,683
I'll just leave it up to me then.

44
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,075
I'm out.

45
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:05,710
- Good luck.
- See you, Drama.

46
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:08,576
Hey, Vince, we found
no sign of forced entry.

47
00:04:08,701 --> 00:04:10,624
And you can't find
anything missing, right?

48
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:13,383
No, but the living room
door was open.

49
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:16,038
- You could have left it open?
- I don't think so.

50
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:19,951
Well, if someone was here, the good news
is you're okay and nothing's been taken.

51
00:04:20,076 --> 00:04:23,012
If they come back, call us
and we'll come back.

52
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,001
Thanks, officers.
I appreciate it.

53
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:26,849
- Thanks for coming down.
- Sorry, Vince.

54
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:28,657
Somebody was here.

55
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,335
Now that everyone's safe and sound
I'm gonna head off to work.

56
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,928
- Want us to roll with?
- No.

57
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:35,065
- Why not?
- I want to make a good impression.

58
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:37,151
What do you think people think
when they see us?

59
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,613
- Call me if you want to have lunch.
- All right, hotshot. Enjoy.

60
00:04:41,843 --> 00:04:45,117
Mr. Vince.
Do you no have underwear for cleaning?

61
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,495
- Yeah, whatever's there, Maria. Thanks.
- No, it's not there.

62
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,445
Is socks and shirts,
but no underwear.

63
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,846
I just dropped my dirty stuff
down there last night.

64
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:55,502
- Tons of underwear.
- Me too.

65
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,963
It's not there.

66
00:04:57,991 --> 00:04:59,423
I told you someone was here.

67
00:04:59,617 --> 00:05:02,009
You think someone broke in
and stole our underwear?

68
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,638
Jesus.

69
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,907
Before we jump in
today we need to welcome

70
00:05:10,032 --> 00:05:12,499
our newest family member,
Mr. Eric Murphy.

71
00:05:12,624 --> 00:05:14,100
Catch him up, show him around.

72
00:05:14,225 --> 00:05:17,623
I want him feeling like he's been here
all his life by the end of the day.

73
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,365
- Got you a cup of coffee, Mr. Murphy.
- Thank you very much.

74
00:05:25,053 --> 00:05:27,368
And these just came
from the front desk for you.

75
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,453
I didn't order any pizza.

76
00:05:29,857 --> 00:05:32,392
Ari Gold sent them.
The delivery guy said to tell you

77
00:05:32,517 --> 00:05:36,210
good luck and you're no longer
a pizza boy, you're now a pizza man.

78
00:05:37,131 --> 00:05:39,254
- Cool.
- Okay, let's get to it.

79
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,466
This is a signing meeting.
So tell me who have we signed?

80
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,798
I have Penelope Cruz,
like, right there.

81
00:05:44,923 --> 00:05:46,965
Right the is not there.
What else?

82
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,842
- I signed Neil Elman.
- Tell me about it.

83
00:05:49,967 --> 00:05:52,061
Hot young writer-director
out of Sundance.

84
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,894
Has two specs ready to go.

85
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:57,350
When they sell we'll clap for you.
On the comedy front,

86
00:05:57,475 --> 00:05:59,352
Chris Rock is doing a new tour,

87
00:05:59,477 --> 00:06:02,111
so you can applaud me
for saving your asses.

88
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:03,699
Silently.

89
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:08,367
But why is Bob Saget
making 50 grand a night

90
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,160
and we're making dick?

91
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,360
I've called him 20 times.
He won't return my calls.

92
00:06:12,485 --> 00:06:14,081
You've called him, Scott?

93
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:18,108
Everyone, let's give Scott Lavin here
a big morning clap

94
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:19,872
'cause he called Bob Saget.

95
00:06:19,997 --> 00:06:22,172
Hi, Bob Saget, this is Scott.

96
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,076
Please call me back.

97
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,245
- I don't think he wants a manager.
- Nobody wants a manager.

98
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,596
- Convince him that he needs one.
- I would love to,

99
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:33,183
- but he won't return my calls.
- Well, stake-out his fucking house.

100
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,686
I used to live next door to Bob.
I know him. I can call him.

101
00:06:36,392 --> 00:06:39,440
So let it be said, let it be done.

102
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,127
Take care.
It's nice to meet you too.

103
00:06:45,252 --> 00:06:46,447
You need anything?

104
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,652
- I need to send Ari Gold something.
- No problem. What is it?

105
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:51,903
Maybe there's a guy
in the mailroom that could help me.

106
00:06:52,028 --> 00:06:53,865
Don't worry.
I'm like one of the guys.

107
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,934
I've only been working for you for two
hours and the pizza thing pissed me off.

108
00:06:57,059 --> 00:06:58,727
- Let me know what I can do.
- OK.

109
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,552
- Murphy group.
- What?

110
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:02,054
Murphy group.

111
00:07:02,837 --> 00:07:04,715
Sexy, can I talk to your man
alone for a beat?

112
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,113
Sure, douchebag.
Told you I was one of the guys.

113
00:07:07,238 --> 00:07:09,232
- I'll be in your office.
- Okay.

114
00:07:09,848 --> 00:07:10,848
What's up?

115
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:14,058
So is this the whole group?

116
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,310
- What do you mean?
- Murray said

117
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,896
we were absorbing the Murphy group.
I was expecting a trifecta.

118
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,648
- Well, it's just me.
- It's a weird fucking name, isn't it?

119
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,484
What's up?
You seem a little tweaked.

120
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,691
Yeah, well, I've been working
two things the last month.

121
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,329
Bob Saget when the sun's up
and the Olsen twins when the sun's down.

122
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:33,368
So I do not need you waltzing in
here and jumping on what's mine.

123
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:37,032
- I was just trying to help, all right?
- Yeah, but you didn't help, you see?

124
00:07:37,398 --> 00:07:40,290
Murray said that this whole place
is kind of like a team thing.

125
00:07:40,415 --> 00:07:42,961
Yeah, it is.
And like any team

126
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,204
you got Lebron James
who make $120 million.

127
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:47,299
Then you got a jerkoff
who's on a 10-day contract.

128
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:51,095
Whichever one of those you're gonna be,
neither steals the ball from the other.

129
00:07:51,288 --> 00:07:54,445
- Why don't we just call Bob together?
- 'Cause I don't want to.

130
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,870
I want to sign Bob alone and I will.

131
00:07:57,671 --> 00:07:59,144
Got a trash can?
Thanks.

132
00:08:07,494 --> 00:08:09,026
Yo, Lawrence.
What's up, kid?

133
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:11,734
- Drama, how you doing?
- How do I look?

134
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:13,408
You look okay, I guess.

135
00:08:13,644 --> 00:08:16,578
- Want to roll up this gate?
- Afraid I can't do that.

136
00:08:17,076 --> 00:08:19,181
- Why not?
- You're on the list.

137
00:08:19,653 --> 00:08:22,321
- What list?
- The banned-from-the-lot list.

138
00:08:22,786 --> 00:08:24,711
That's why your picture
is right there.

139
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,549
Well, my picture
is also right there.

140
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,636
- How do you explain that?
- Can't.

141
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:32,805
But the message came
from Dan Coakley himself,

142
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,347
so I'm assuming whatever
you did was real bad.

143
00:08:37,932 --> 00:08:40,018
Will you please get
Dan Coakley on the phone?

144
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,186
Sure.

145
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,060
Stop calling the office, John.

146
00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:46,818
Stop lurking outside
and stop trying to push me.

147
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,737
<i>Please just let me
in so we can talk.</i>

148
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,873
- What's to talk about?
- I'd like to apologize.

149
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,135
- <i>I'm not interested in an apology.</i>
- Come on.

150
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,033
We had words. Men do that.

151
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,785
You put your hands around my throat.

152
00:08:56,987 --> 00:08:58,620
Men sometimes do that also.

153
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:02,261
- <i>You said some pretty awful things.</i>
- So you're not really apologizing,

154
00:09:02,386 --> 00:09:04,568
you're just making
excuses for attacking me.

155
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:06,399
- No, I...
- So if I was to tell you

156
00:09:06,524 --> 00:09:08,172
that Meadow Soprano blew me

157
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,917
<i>last night, you might just go
and attack me again. The fact is</i>

158
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:15,095
- she's here now sucking on my dick.
- <i>All right, that's enough.</i>

159
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,431
- All right? I'm trying here.
- <i>Try harder,</i>

160
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:21,252
'cause she is about
to swallow my balls
while I dive into her pussy.

161
00:09:21,377 --> 00:09:23,687
<i>That's it, you're a dead man, Coakley.
Do you hear me?</i>

162
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,648
You're a fucking dead man!
I'm gonna rip your fucking scalp off!

163
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:35,400
Did Mr. Coakley say you can go on?

164
00:09:36,186 --> 00:09:38,205
Vince, as proud as I am

165
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,256
that you've reached stalker status,
you can't play around.

166
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,582
- These are sick individuals.
- We have an alarm.

167
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,385
- I'll learn to turn it on.
- You need to call my security guy.

168
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,845
This guy is the best.

169
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,630
I had a problem neighbor.

170
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,740
Couldn't trust him for shit.
When this guy was done arming my house,

171
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:54,801
it was as secure as Air Force One.

172
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,054
I didn't realize
you were such a pussy, Ari.

173
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:00,150
I didn't realize your attack dog
was as worthless as you, Turtle.

174
00:10:00,275 --> 00:10:01,099
He's not.

175
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,462
I think he's going deaf.

176
00:10:03,587 --> 00:10:04,665
Watch, Vin.

177
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:08,148
See?

178
00:10:10,621 --> 00:10:12,984
- He's not deaf, he's stoned.
- Are we done here?

179
00:10:13,109 --> 00:10:16,065
We are not done, all right?
You need to take this really seriously.

180
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,033
Somebody broke in here,

181
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,319
went to your laundry room,
stole your underwear.

182
00:10:20,444 --> 00:10:23,497
I need to paint a picture of what goes
through the mind of someone like that?

183
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,282
- No, please, don't.
- Call my guy.

184
00:10:26,407 --> 00:10:28,669
- Forget that. Let's go get a gun.
- Don't get a gun.

185
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,702
- Why not?
- Because itwon't be a great story

186
00:10:30,827 --> 00:10:33,970
- if Turtle shoots you in the face.
- I'm a good shot, Ari.

187
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:34,957
Are you?

188
00:10:35,082 --> 00:10:37,120
I think I would be.
I'm a good free-throw shooter.

189
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:40,243
Vince, I thought you were maturing.
All this work and you're not listening.

190
00:10:40,368 --> 00:10:42,365
You're gonna lethim
be the 1st line of defense

191
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,637
against some boxer
stealing serial killer?

192
00:10:44,762 --> 00:10:46,019
She could be a hot fan.

193
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,840
More likely he's a creepy
little pale obsessive freak.

194
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,110
- God.
- Speaking of which, where's E?

195
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:52,317
He got an alibi?

196
00:10:57,893 --> 00:11:01,724
- A Sloan McQuewick calling for you.
- Tell her I'm in a meeting.

197
00:11:01,849 --> 00:11:03,829
Tell her I'll call you back.
I'll call her back.

198
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,296
- I'll take it.
- What?

199
00:11:05,421 --> 00:11:06,571
Yeah, just...

200
00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:08,208
put her through.

201
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,854
Guess I should learn how to pronounce
this one's name, huh?

202
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:13,213
- Got a minute, babe?
- He's got an important call.

203
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,757
Actually, this is equally important.
Doubly important.

204
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,593
- That's OK. I'll call back.
- Just take a message.

205
00:11:19,318 --> 00:11:22,975
- Hey, what's up?
- I got Bob Saget to agree to come in.

206
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,513
- That's great.
- Yeah.

207
00:11:24,638 --> 00:11:26,698
- How'd you do that?
- Dropped your name.

208
00:11:26,823 --> 00:11:29,514
- Cool. I'm glad I could help.
- He wants you in the meeting.

209
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,304
We're gonna do it in my office.

210
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,361
Look, Eric, I don't know
what you guys have together.

211
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,992
You're friends, you're neighbors,

212
00:11:38,117 --> 00:11:40,713
you used his prick as a whistle...
whatever it is, he's mine.

213
00:11:40,838 --> 00:11:43,076
- Okay, we clear? He's mine.
- Yeah.

214
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,594
All right.
Good.

215
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,001
- Calm down, Johnny.
- <i>Don't tell me to calm down.</i>

216
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:53,183
I try to apologize to this guy

217
00:11:53,308 --> 00:11:55,255
when he should be apologizing to me.

218
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,592
- You attacked him.
- <i>You know what he said?</i>

219
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,427
I know he's saying he said
nothing and that you're crazy.

220
00:12:00,604 --> 00:12:02,763
Everyone knows how he is.
I want to take this to the top.

221
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,639
<i>All you have is your word
against his.</i>

222
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,451
Then I'll find someone
who can back up my words.

223
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,272
What is that?

224
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,441
It's for Ari from Eric Murphy.

225
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,870
"Suck it."

226
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,185
That is not what this is for.

227
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,952
I think there's someone in the tree.

228
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,619
Stop.
You're stoned.

229
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,537
May be, but I'm not kidding.
Come look.

230
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:33,281
- Where?
- There.

231
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,298
- It's a bird.
- No, there.

232
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,712
- That is a squirrel.
- That's not where I'm looking.

233
00:12:38,837 --> 00:12:42,193
I'm looking through the tree past
that shrub right behind the car.

234
00:12:42,318 --> 00:12:44,256
I should never have
let Jamie take Ahnold.

235
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:45,467
You're crazy.

236
00:12:45,782 --> 00:12:48,374
- I don't feel safe.
- There is nothing there.

237
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:50,763
- We should go out there.
- No, stop it.

238
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:53,522
I'm not gonna let you
or Ari make me paranoid.

239
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,040
Jesus!

240
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,602
It's just Temo.

241
00:13:01,996 --> 00:13:04,058
Okay, now I am a bit freaked.

242
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,997
Bob, what you do not know about me

243
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,833
is that I am 24/7.

244
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:16,461
That is my middle fucking name.
Scotty 24/7 Lavin.

245
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,199
What that means
is that every time you turn around

246
00:13:19,324 --> 00:13:22,863
anywhere, anytime,
you will be looking at this.

247
00:13:22,988 --> 00:13:25,458
That's just great.
That's just what I want to be looking at

248
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,806
while I'm sniffing a line
off her ass... Your fucking face.

249
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:30,693
That really completes the image.
You believe that, Scotty?

250
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:32,967
If you do, you'd believe the check is in the mail.

251
00:13:33,092 --> 00:13:34,525
Understand and you're reluctant.

252
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,191
But I want you to know that I swear
to God on my mother, I'll kill for you.

253
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,432
- You will?
- Yes.

254
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:41,408
- What if I kill?
- What do you mean?

255
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:43,527
I mean, what if I kill
somebody late at night

256
00:13:43,652 --> 00:13:46,596
and I call you up and I go,
"Hey, 24/7, I'm fucked.

257
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:49,035
"I just killed a guy at some
crack den in the hood."

258
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,824
Will you come down there
in your silver 750 and pick me up

259
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:54,683
and help me chop up the body
and dispose of it and then take me home

260
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:57,379
and bathe me and then tuck me in?
Would you do all that for me?

261
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,879
Because I would do that for me

262
00:13:59,263 --> 00:14:01,214
to keep 10 % of the money
that I make.

263
00:14:02,106 --> 00:14:04,009
We're done now.
I'm gonna talk to E.

264
00:14:05,314 --> 00:14:07,596
- So what's up, E?
- How are you, Bob?

265
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,292
I'm almost as good as she looks
but not nearly as good as she tastes.

266
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,392
You're so sweet, Bob.

267
00:14:12,972 --> 00:14:15,378
- So who's Vince fucking?
- No one specific.

268
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:18,440
- Come on, don't hold out on me.
- You know, he just... He's having fun.

269
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:21,026
- Did he do Milano in the tail?
- What? No.

270
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,819
I saw her coming out of the house.

271
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,391
- She was with Drama.
- I used to live next door tothem.

272
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:28,584
The puss that rolled in and out
made my house look like a monastery.

273
00:14:30,058 --> 00:14:31,021
That's great.

274
00:14:31,146 --> 00:14:33,832
- Can we get back to this?
- Actually, no, Scotty, we can't.

275
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:37,157
Not with you here. Because
you make me un-fucking-comfortable.

276
00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:39,044
I'm gonna talk to E now.
Would you leave?

277
00:14:39,806 --> 00:14:42,756
- This is my office.
- Wewon't stain anything. Don't worry.

278
00:14:51,211 --> 00:14:53,219
I don't like that guy.
Do you like that guy?

279
00:14:53,344 --> 00:14:54,392
No, he's creepy.

280
00:14:54,578 --> 00:14:57,437
- He's trying to take care of you.
- I don't get taken care of by dudes.

281
00:14:58,143 --> 00:14:59,105
Hey, I get it.

282
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,178
Murray wants on his roster.

283
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:04,613
I make so much money that it ain't gonna
mean nothing to give him a commission.

284
00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:06,782
But I want something in return.

285
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:10,018
- What is it?
- Don't think I'm weird.

286
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,619
- Anything, bob.
- Promise you won't call me weird?

287
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,562
Say it.
I won't call you weird.

288
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,332
- I want to have sex in Murray's office.
- What?

289
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:21,095
I want to fuck her
in Murray's office.

290
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,800
I get it, bob.

291
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,969
- I'm sorry we wasted...
- No, I'm serious.

292
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:32,409
I'm not weird, i'm pragmatic.
This would be great for my memoirs.

293
00:15:32,534 --> 00:15:35,183
Murray Berenson, the guy's a legend.
Fucking on his couch?

294
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,351
You serious, bob?

295
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,607
Do I ever tease
when I'm talking about fucking?

296
00:15:40,624 --> 00:15:42,524
I'm serious.
I'm not weird.

297
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:44,079
Think about it.

298
00:15:48,002 --> 00:15:49,858
Thanks for taking
the time to see me.

299
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:52,502
Of course. Turtle told me
you were freaking out.

300
00:15:52,627 --> 00:15:54,479
But I'm not sure what I can do.

301
00:15:54,604 --> 00:15:57,833
Just speak the truth and I'll have
my lawyer write everything down.

302
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,379
Johnny, the truth is

303
00:15:59,504 --> 00:16:01,968
Dan Coakley didn't say
anything inappropriate to me.

304
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:04,170
- He was all about business.
- Impossible.

305
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,362
- He's got a pilot he wants me to do.
- He wants to do you, jamie.

306
00:16:07,487 --> 00:16:09,050
- Wake up.
- Drama!

307
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:11,630
I'm not saying he doesn't want you
to do the pilot also.

308
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:13,680
- But do you know what he said to me?
- I do.

309
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,576
And I so appreciate
you sticking up for me.

310
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,060
But he didn't say
any of those things to me.

311
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,854
He's trying to lure you in.

312
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,174
That won't happen.

313
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:24,476
Maybe you can lure him in.

314
00:16:24,601 --> 00:16:26,614
- What do you mean?
- Go visit him.

315
00:16:26,739 --> 00:16:29,281
Wear something sexy, smell nice.

316
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,139
Get him a little excited maybe.

317
00:16:31,264 --> 00:16:33,314
- Maybe wear a wire?
- Would you?

318
00:16:35,748 --> 00:16:38,129
I know the spot you're in,
and I feel so bad

319
00:16:38,254 --> 00:16:40,206
because I was involved
in causing it,

320
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,794
but he really didn't
do anything to me.

321
00:16:43,345 --> 00:16:44,544
I'm really sorry.

322
00:16:45,627 --> 00:16:46,777
I understand.

323
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:48,923
What are you gonna do?

324
00:16:49,665 --> 00:16:50,815
I don't know.

325
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,757
You don't have to feel bad.
It's not your fault.

326
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,892
- <i>I know, but I do feel bad.</i>
- That's because you're a good person.

327
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,394
- I try to be.
- <i>Drama's got his demons.</i>

328
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,064
He's got to work them out,
unfortunately. How's my boy?

329
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,650
He's good.
He's trying to drive.

330
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,465
- <i>What are you guys doing?</i>
- Me and Vince are looking for guns.

331
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,938
- <i>For what?</i>
- For protection, what else?

332
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:13,114
<i>You will end up</i>

333
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,110
like Plaxico shooting yourself.

334
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,095
Why does nobody think
I can handle a gun?

335
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,329
- 'cause you're not that type.
- <i>You don't know</i>

336
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,739
the tough guy roots from whence I came.
Tell her.

337
00:17:21,864 --> 00:17:23,842
- He's a killer, Jamie.
- You hear that?

338
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,751
<i>I did.</i>

339
00:17:24,928 --> 00:17:27,572
But try not to kill yourself
or Vince, please.

340
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,042
<i>I promise I won't.
I'll call you later, okay?</i>

341
00:17:32,277 --> 00:17:34,787
- She's worried.
- I don't see why.

342
00:17:36,175 --> 00:17:38,098
Sir, we'll take
a whole bunch of these.

343
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,250
Good choice.

344
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,601
So what do you do,
just brown paper bag it and we're off?

345
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,229
Unfortunately we got a 10-day
waiting period in California.

346
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,773
10 days?
We got to protect ourselves now.

347
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,609
- Call your government.
- What can we get to tide ourselves?

348
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,077
You like knives?

349
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,875
- You are fucking with me.
- I'm not.

350
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,637
You're trying
to put me in a bad spot.

351
00:17:59,762 --> 00:18:02,107
You make me look bad,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

352
00:18:02,232 --> 00:18:04,882
I've been here four hours.
You want to fight me?

353
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:07,105
You want to rep Saget,
he's all yours.

354
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,907
I'm trying to explain to you exactly
what it is that you're dealing with.

355
00:18:10,032 --> 00:18:12,674
I understand. And I'm trying to explain
to you that I'm not buying it.

356
00:18:13,512 --> 00:18:16,302
- What?
- I teed this one up for you, all right?

357
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,537
You got tosell Murray
on it and the credit's yours.

358
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:20,882
Yeah, I get it.
All I got to do is tell Murray

359
00:18:21,007 --> 00:18:23,009
that bob Saget wants
to fuck in his office.

360
00:18:23,134 --> 00:18:25,811
I don't believe it
and I'm just not gonna do it.

361
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,324
Then I will.

362
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:34,654
What are you doing, Drama?

363
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,658
I'm desperate. You've known me 3 years.
You know I'm a good guy.

364
00:18:38,835 --> 00:18:40,838
You know I take my job
very seriously.

365
00:18:40,963 --> 00:18:42,638
And there's no way I can let you on.

366
00:18:42,763 --> 00:18:45,331
See this gift basket over here?
It's yours if you do.

367
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:48,094
What's it got,
fruit or some bullshit in there?

368
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:50,976
Three different ipods,
cherry-infused Godiva chocolates,

369
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:52,937
Peter Thomas Roth wrinkle peel pads,

370
00:18:53,062 --> 00:18:54,957
- cookies from Deluscious...
- Cookies?

371
00:18:56,075 --> 00:18:57,093
Chocolate chip?

372
00:18:57,951 --> 00:18:59,846
Sprinkles cupcakes too.

373
00:19:01,614 --> 00:19:04,382
Go on. You tell 'em you
went through gate 4 if you're caught.

374
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:05,557
You got it.

375
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,008
Dan Coakley's office.

376
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:20,140
Mr. Chase!
Mr. Chase, you can't go in there!

377
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,038
Gorgeous, I've got to go.

378
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,375
You really want
to destroy your life?

379
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:31,336
I came here

380
00:19:31,705 --> 00:19:33,046
to offer a real apology.

381
00:19:33,446 --> 00:19:35,173
This morning you were right.

382
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,802
I was insincere.

383
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:39,556
I was making excuses for my actions.

384
00:19:40,487 --> 00:19:41,937
See, Dan, I have...

385
00:19:42,339 --> 00:19:44,252
impulse control issues

386
00:19:44,524 --> 00:19:48,333
topped with anger management problems
mixed in with desperate insecurities.

387
00:19:48,758 --> 00:19:51,900
Constantly I feel the need
to overcompensate.

388
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:55,508
I don't know if it's because I felt
ma loved my brother more than me

389
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:58,273
or because my father started
calling me a pussy at age three.

390
00:19:58,398 --> 00:19:59,947
But here I am exposed to you

391
00:20:00,072 --> 00:20:03,284
offering you my sincere,
most heartfelt apologies.

392
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,453
I just... when you said those things

393
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:08,399
that you said about
my buddy's girlfriend, I...

394
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:11,819
You know what you said.
Right? I mean...

395
00:20:12,616 --> 00:20:14,379
Tell me again what you said, Dan.

396
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:17,087
It's cool. I won't get mad.

397
00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:19,759
You can tell me.
Tell me again what you said.

398
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,612
What are you doing, john?

399
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,429
What?

400
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:27,350
What, are you...
Are you recording this or something?

401
00:20:27,681 --> 00:20:28,474
What?

402
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:31,604
I've produced enough bad cop shows
to know when somebody's wearing a wire.

403
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,984
- What's in your pocket?
- Nothing.

404
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,356
I see something.

405
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,779
- That's my cell phone.
- Take it out.

406
00:20:41,634 --> 00:20:42,734
Take it out.

407
00:20:43,593 --> 00:20:45,861
- Dan.
- John.

408
00:20:54,048 --> 00:20:56,597
Don't fire me. Please please,
this job is everything to me.

409
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,799
It's all I've got. I've worked
18 years to get to this position.

410
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:01,801
I know I got problems.
I know it.

411
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,512
I'll work on it.
I'll paint your house.

412
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:07,397
I'll wash your car.
Please, Dan, I'm at your mercy.

413
00:21:07,522 --> 00:21:09,222
- Please!
- Get up.

414
00:21:13,624 --> 00:21:16,399
- I'm not gonna fire you.
- You're not?

415
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,318
You got a stay of execution
from Burns.

416
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:19,736
- Really?
- Plus...

417
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:23,698
I kind of figured that if I do fire you
you might find a job somewhere else.

418
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,868
- So what does this mean?
- It means I'm going to torture you.

419
00:21:27,339 --> 00:21:28,328
How?

420
00:21:28,714 --> 00:21:30,272
Tune in next week.

421
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,753
So, day one, how's it going?

422
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:37,057
Really good.
I really like the energy of the place.

423
00:21:37,182 --> 00:21:39,588
- That's good.
- Plus I've been alone so long

424
00:21:39,713 --> 00:21:42,677
it's nice to feel like a real person,
have people to talk to about things.

425
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,511
It's a great team.
What did you want to talk to me about?

426
00:21:46,244 --> 00:21:48,378
- What about him?
- Well, we had a meeting.

427
00:21:48,503 --> 00:21:50,803
On day one? I love it.
How'd it go?

428
00:21:51,136 --> 00:21:54,133
- Well, do you know Bob at all?
- No. Did you close him?

429
00:21:54,258 --> 00:21:56,646
No, but we're right there.
But do we really want him?

430
00:21:56,771 --> 00:21:58,560
He's a big earner.
Why wouldn't we?

431
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:00,080
Well, he's strange.

432
00:22:00,205 --> 00:22:02,862
Who isn't in this town?
Talk to me, Eric.

433
00:22:03,662 --> 00:22:06,398
- This is really uncomfortable.
- It shouldn't be.

434
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:13,539
Bob Saget would like
to have sex in your office.

435
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,809
- What?
- He said it'd be good for his memoirs.

436
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,488
And he'll sign with us if we'll...

437
00:22:17,871 --> 00:22:18,892
Or if you'll...

438
00:22:19,017 --> 00:22:20,017
let him

439
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:23,132
are you asking me if Bob Saget
can fuck in my office?

440
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,343
I'm just repeating the information.

441
00:22:26,033 --> 00:22:27,512
Maybe I made a mistake with you.

442
00:22:28,235 --> 00:22:31,349
This isn't a whorehouse, Eric.
This is my office.

443
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,712
I built my business sitting
right here at this desk.

444
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,273
And you want to have
Bob Saget defile it.

445
00:22:38,975 --> 00:22:42,660
No, look, I just... You wanted Bob Saget
and this is what he asked for.

446
00:22:45,507 --> 00:22:46,395
Jesus, Eric.

447
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,950
You really make a fuckface
when you're scared.

448
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,817
- What?
- Bring him in. I don't give a shit.

449
00:22:51,942 --> 00:22:54,455
My ex-wife decorated
this place anyway.

450
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,917
- Really?
- Get a cleaning crew in here after.

451
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:01,452
- Good first day?
- Real good.

452
00:23:01,577 --> 00:23:04,926
Great. Maybe tomorrow you'll
go get Christian Bale.

453
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:07,427
We'll let him execute
a cinematographer if he wants.

454
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:08,970
See you later.

455
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:13,846
At least you still have your job.

456
00:23:13,971 --> 00:23:16,207
Yeah, but I can't imagine
what this guy's planning.

457
00:23:16,332 --> 00:23:18,940
Johnny, just give it a couple of weeks.
I'm sure it'll subside.

458
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,474
Whatever.
I'll be fine.

459
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,460
Right now I'm worried
about my baby bro.

460
00:23:22,585 --> 00:23:23,901
Don't.
I'll be fine too.

461
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,519
I know you will be.

462
00:23:26,127 --> 00:23:27,596
So where'd you get these?

463
00:23:27,721 --> 00:23:29,787
- John Milius' garage sale.
- Are they loaded?

464
00:23:29,912 --> 00:23:31,190
Of course, bro.

465
00:23:31,315 --> 00:23:33,519
You can't protect yourself
with an empty gun.

466
00:23:33,644 --> 00:23:35,404
So we're gonna shoot
if he comes back?

467
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:37,589
Would you rather wait
for the cops to come back

468
00:23:37,714 --> 00:23:40,397
and find us tied up
and drained of all our blood?

469
00:23:41,425 --> 00:23:43,337
Where's my drink,
you muttering, stuttering...

470
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,090
It's not a toy, you fucking idiot.
It's a loaded weapon.

471
00:23:54,568 --> 00:23:56,309
We should call Ari's security guy.
