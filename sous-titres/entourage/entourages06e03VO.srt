5
00:01:32,998 --> 00:01:34,501
Ashley?

6
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:41,023
Ashley?

7
00:01:41,153 --> 00:01:42,162
Hey.

8
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:44,696
Oh, hey.
I thought you left.

9
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,728
No, I'm here.
I made coffee.

10
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:48,324
Cool.

11
00:01:48,377 --> 00:01:50,720
I hope you don't mind that
I'm watching your pilot.

12
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,125
No. I don't mind.

13
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:55,504
Since you would
never show it to me.

14
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,758
I would have
showed it to you.

15
00:01:59,214 --> 00:02:00,958
What?
What's so funny?

16
00:02:01,011 --> 00:02:03,065
Oh, no.
I was laughing at you.

17
00:02:04,597 --> 00:02:06,101
I thought you were
laughing at the show.

18
00:02:06,177 --> 00:02:07,980
I was laughing
at the show earlier.

19
00:02:08,026 --> 00:02:10,364
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah. Which one's your client?

20
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,595
The black kid.
He plays Renoir.

21
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:14,819
Oh really? I hate him.

22
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:23,056
Do you really need to give
me a hard time today, ma?

23
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:25,251
Everyone's giving me
a hard time today, Turtle.

24
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:27,183
I'm the laughingstock
of the salon.

25
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,803
Come on,
what's the big deal?

26
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,347
Did you see this caption?

27
00:02:30,394 --> 00:02:32,220
"She's dating him?!"

28
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:34,783
Question mark,
exclamation point, in bold.

29
00:02:34,827 --> 00:02:36,928
- At least I look good.
- No, you don't.

30
00:02:36,993 --> 00:02:39,523
You look like shit.
Sneakers with a tuxedo?

31
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,437
- They're patent leather.
- They're ridiculous.

32
00:02:41,472 --> 00:02:43,539
You know, ma, this is really
not a great birthday call.

33
00:02:43,586 --> 00:02:45,065
Maybe it's a wakeup call.

34
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:47,946
You're no spring chicken
anymore, Turtle. Get it together.

35
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:51,414
- I'm trying.
- I know you are.

36
00:02:51,978 --> 00:02:53,422
And I love you.

37
00:02:53,586 --> 00:02:56,421
- I love you too.
- Have a happy birthday.

38
00:02:56,952 --> 00:02:58,150
Thanks.

39
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:00,956
Jesus, take it easy.

40
00:03:01,003 --> 00:03:04,203
I didn't even ask her to watch it.
And who says something like that anyway?

41
00:03:04,244 --> 00:03:05,794
Maybe she's trying to be constructive.

42
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:07,391
I hate him?
That's constructive?

43
00:03:07,432 --> 00:03:10,136
- I hate when people tell me they hate me.
- I didn't even ask her to sleep over.

44
00:03:10,183 --> 00:03:11,827
- She just did.
- That's bullshit.

45
00:03:11,874 --> 00:03:14,498
This morning she used my
french press and broke it.

46
00:03:14,815 --> 00:03:16,776
Jesus Christ, E.
You know what?

47
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:18,831
- Now I hate her.
- So do I. She's done.

48
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:21,167
Okay, so she's done. So why are
you letting her make you insecure?

49
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:22,799
I'm not letting her
make me insecure.

50
00:03:22,846 --> 00:03:25,000
Only a bitch lets a bitch
make them insecure anyway.

51
00:03:25,042 --> 00:03:27,355
I'm not letting her make me insecure,
Drama. But you of all people

52
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,527
should know how stressful
a test screening can be.

53
00:03:29,563 --> 00:03:32,345
I'm on a hit series now.
Test screenings are long behind me.

54
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:34,658
So sorry if I can't
coagulate with you.

55
00:03:34,917 --> 00:03:37,054
I don't think you're using
that word properly, Johnny.

56
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:38,322
- Really?
- Whatever.

57
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:40,107
Just pray this test screening goes well.

58
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:42,251
'Cause Charlie really needs it
and so does the Murphy Group.

59
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:44,130
You should have let me do that
cameo they wanted me to do.

60
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:45,740
Then you'd both have had no worries.

61
00:03:45,762 --> 00:03:47,976
You might have. I don't
think Scorsese'd be thrilled

62
00:03:48,023 --> 00:03:49,914
to see you rolling around on The CW.

63
00:03:49,972 --> 00:03:52,062
- No, you're probably right.
- What are you doing?

64
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:54,023
- We're gonna pray.
- Get off me.

65
00:03:54,097 --> 00:03:56,246
- What are you guys doing here?
- Turtle!

66
00:03:57,508 --> 00:03:59,410
- The birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, Turtle.

67
00:03:59,475 --> 00:04:01,976
- Thanks, Vin.
- I made you your favorite,

68
00:04:02,252 --> 00:04:03,978
with a little twist.

69
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,050
Interesting. Thanks.

70
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:07,789
What's wrong?

71
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:10,008
- My mother's mean.
- She always was.

72
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:13,202
Remember your 13th birthday?
She got you a Weight Watchers membership.

73
00:04:13,484 --> 00:04:15,515
- Didn't until now.
- What did she say?

74
00:04:15,574 --> 00:04:17,776
She saw the "People"
magazine pictures.

75
00:04:18,856 --> 00:04:20,746
- The sneakers.
- She thinks I'm a loser.

76
00:04:20,817 --> 00:04:23,353
Turtle, you're in a magazine that's
published all across the world.

77
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:25,502
You're not a loser.
Now knock it off. Come on,

78
00:04:25,544 --> 00:04:27,667
we have a lot of fun
planned for you this birthday.

79
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:29,177
Yeah?
What are we doing?

80
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:31,232
I have a little practice
to do on the track.

81
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:33,380
- So what, you want me to drive you there?
- No,

82
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:35,576
but I do want you to drive.

83
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,350
If you bump me, Drama,
I'm gonna kill you.

84
00:04:41,401 --> 00:04:44,043
If anybody bumps anybody in
these cars, I'm gonna kill them.

85
00:04:44,102 --> 00:04:46,826
Quit your whining, fellas.
I'm playing to win.

86
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,851
You sure you got
the nerves, baby bro?

87
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,683
Oh, I'm quite sure, Johnny.

88
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:52,675
- Oh, and by the way, Turtle.
- Yeah, Vin?

89
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:55,023
I'm dedicating
this victory to you, kid.

90
00:04:55,815 --> 00:04:58,476
- Never happen.
- Yeah? We'll see.

91
00:05:32,464 --> 00:05:34,429
Yeah!
Yeah!

92
00:05:35,346 --> 00:05:36,744
Damn!

93
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:39,655
- That was awesome.
- Unreal.

94
00:05:39,726 --> 00:05:41,687
Who would have
thought I just got my license?

95
00:05:41,734 --> 00:05:44,317
- I think I need a Ferrari.
- In this economy?

96
00:05:44,388 --> 00:05:46,936
People will think
you're a real douchebag.

97
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:50,676
Forget what people think.

98
00:05:52,482 --> 00:05:54,416
This thing is a beast.

99
00:05:57,155 --> 00:05:58,250
What?

100
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,938
Happy birthday, Turtle.

101
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:02,860
- Are you kidding?
- My gift's on the front seat.

102
00:06:03,182 --> 00:06:05,160
- Vin, I can't take this.
- Yes, you can.

103
00:06:05,194 --> 00:06:08,336
- It's a $200,000 car.
- $240, actually.

104
00:06:08,341 --> 00:06:10,432
But I'm playing Enzo Ferrari,
so I got 10% off.

105
00:06:10,856 --> 00:06:12,577
Seriously, I don't
feel right about this.

106
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:15,670
I didn't feel right about the last
car I gave you getting repossessed.

107
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:18,104
Besides, I've had a great year
and you're my good luck charm.

108
00:06:18,109 --> 00:06:19,975
So please enjoy.

109
00:06:21,408 --> 00:06:22,360
Okay.

110
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:23,838
Happy birthday, Turtle.

111
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:26,373
It's Charlie.

112
00:06:27,508 --> 00:06:28,556
Hey, what's up?

113
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,314
- Any word?
- Not yet,

114
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,208
but I'll call you as soon
as I hear something.

115
00:06:32,321 --> 00:06:34,022
Look, I'm nervous, E.
I don't like tests.

116
00:06:34,057 --> 00:06:35,907
Me either, but I think
we're gonna be okay.

117
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:38,176
Look, would you call my
mom and tell her that?

118
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:40,519
Yeah, I will. And I'll call
you soon as I hear something.

119
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:42,883
- All right, man.
- All right, later.

120
00:06:43,483 --> 00:06:45,057
This kid's a mess.

121
00:06:45,326 --> 00:06:46,551
And you're a rock.

122
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:49,497
I'm going to Ari's for the state of the union.
I'll catch up with you guys later.

123
00:06:49,502 --> 00:06:52,203
Make sure it's strong.
I still got to pay for this.

124
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:55,110
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
It's all paid for.

125
00:06:57,255 --> 00:06:59,531
- Good afternoon, Mr. Murphy.
- Mr. Murphy?

126
00:06:59,638 --> 00:07:01,650
Mr. Gold is ready
and awaiting your arrival.

127
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:03,589
Good, but what's
with the "Mr. Murphy"?

128
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:06,464
Mr. Gold has asked me to be more
formal when speaking with the clients

129
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,184
even the ones
I consider friends.

130
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:09,454
Well, I don't like it.

131
00:07:09,553 --> 00:07:11,249
Oh, please tell him,
because I don't either.

132
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:13,212
- But please don't tell him I don't.
- I won't.

133
00:07:13,217 --> 00:07:15,116
Would you like a
Kiwi-Strawberry diet Hansen's?

134
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:17,038
No thanks. I'm fine.

135
00:07:17,281 --> 00:07:19,067
Mr. Gold,
Mr. Murphy is here.

136
00:07:19,511 --> 00:07:21,169
Indeed he is.

137
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:23,200
- Why are you smiling?
- I'm not smiling. I was-

138
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:25,123
- Don't, this is an office.
- But-

139
00:07:25,369 --> 00:07:27,090
Did you offer Mr. Murphy
his favorite beverage?

140
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:28,760
Yes. He declined.

141
00:07:29,307 --> 00:07:32,020
Lloyd has memorized all
my client's favorite drinks.

142
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:35,661
- I said no smiling.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Gold.

143
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:39,692
- What are you doing to the guy?
- I'm making him a man.

144
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:42,386
- Do you remember when I made you one?
- Yes, I do.

145
00:07:42,391 --> 00:07:44,727
- And did you thank me?
- No.

146
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,347
- What's wrong?
- I'm a little stressed out.

147
00:07:47,352 --> 00:07:49,095
Testing Charlie's pilot today, so...

148
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,238
TV?

149
00:07:50,326 --> 00:07:52,970
You're stressed out over TV?
You're in the feature film business.

150
00:07:53,093 --> 00:07:55,536
And thanks to me
you're now conquering it.

151
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,721
Talk to me, Ari.
What have we got?

152
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:58,752
- Let's hear.
- We got a $9 million offer

153
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:02,160
from Paramount. We got
a $10 million offer from FOX.

154
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:04,732
And we got a $12 million
offer from Universal.

155
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:06,570
- I like it. Any of them good?
- They're all good.

156
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:09,183
Which one is the best?
We'll have to read to decide.

157
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,116
Well, you know Vince's
new motto: Line 'em up.

158
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:14,801
Line 'em up we will. See, this
town isn't so rough after all.

159
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:16,858
Oh wow, this is the studio.

160
00:08:17,004 --> 00:08:19,177
- Do you mind if I take this here?
- What else do I have to do?

161
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:20,917
- Hey, Amy.
- Hey, Eric.

162
00:08:20,922 --> 00:08:23,063
- How were the scores?
- Well...

163
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:25,502
The show tested 87%.

164
00:08:25,615 --> 00:08:28,169
- Excellent or very good.
- 87? That's amazing, right?

165
00:08:28,256 --> 00:08:29,904
It is.
It's not all positive.

166
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:32,907
- What do you mean?
- Charlie didn't score as well.

167
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:35,611
- What did he score?
- 59.

168
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:37,702
59? Jesus, what does
that mean?

169
00:08:37,737 --> 00:08:39,401
It means we're gonna
replace him.

170
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:44,790
- What's this sudden panic, Turtle?
- I don't want you to miss out on this.

171
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:45,716
I don't either.

172
00:08:45,721 --> 00:08:48,981
Every time I get in a cab with some
smelly guy wiping snot on his sleeve

173
00:08:49,121 --> 00:08:52,193
I dream of a world where this
hot broad picks me up in a limo.

174
00:08:52,228 --> 00:08:54,153
Lim-Hos is a home run, Turtle.

175
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:56,413
But if you want the money from
me, you're gonna have to wait.

176
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:59,420
I can't wait anymore. You got to
understand, I need a partner now.

177
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,565
I understand.
Just go ask Vince.

178
00:09:02,157 --> 00:09:04,757
- He's given me enough.
- Yeah, I hear ya.

179
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:07,191
Oh well. Sorry, brother.

180
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:10,369
Yeah, me too. I'll talk
to you later, Ronnie.

181
00:09:12,825 --> 00:09:15,859
- Yo, Turtle.
- Yo, Curtis. What's up?

182
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:19,524
What's up, man? I see you
out here in your daddy's car.

183
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:23,529
Don't be somber.
At least you look good.

184
00:09:30,415 --> 00:09:31,917
This is bullshit.

185
00:09:31,952 --> 00:09:34,242
First they bring in some hack
to rewrite his script,

186
00:09:34,277 --> 00:09:36,369
now they're gonna replace him
as an actor on his own show?

187
00:09:36,404 --> 00:09:38,501
- Happens all the time.
- Yeah, well, it's not right.

188
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,025
The world is a cold
and heartless place.

189
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,459
What am I supposed
to do, Ari?

190
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:44,617
E, it's real simple.
You stay on as producer

191
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:47,173
or you walk out of pride.
Either way Charlie's going.

192
00:09:47,357 --> 00:09:48,492
This is unbelievable.

193
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,303
Take heart. You produce 100
episodes of even mediocre television

194
00:09:52,338 --> 00:09:55,925
and you can send the
kid a gulfstream to cry on.

195
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,366
- Oh!
- What the fuck?

196
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:05,268
I'm trying to snap you
out of your funk.

197
00:10:05,368 --> 00:10:07,904
- I'm not in a funk.
- You are a little off though, Turtle.

198
00:10:08,004 --> 00:10:09,438
It's birthday blues,
I guess.

199
00:10:09,538 --> 00:10:12,658
You got a hot car and a
hot girlfriend coming over.

200
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:14,710
What do you have
to be blue about?

201
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,113
It's my birthday, I can
be whatever color I want.

202
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:19,215
- Yello?
- Hey, Vince.

203
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:21,868
- Yo, what's up, Charlie?
- E's not there, is he?

204
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:24,119
- No he's not. Everything okay?
- I don't know.

205
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,484
I haven't heard anything from
him. I think he's avoiding me.

206
00:10:26,489 --> 00:10:28,925
- I'm freaking out over here.
- He's not avoiding you, Charlie.

207
00:10:29,025 --> 00:10:31,211
- All right, then where is he?
- I don't know. But if I hear from him

208
00:10:31,216 --> 00:10:32,586
I'll have him hit you back.

209
00:10:32,794 --> 00:10:34,964
- All right, man. Thanks.
- Cool. Bye.

210
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,817
- What's up?
- E's M.I.A.

211
00:10:38,642 --> 00:10:41,515
Maybe he's just so small
that nobody can find him.

212
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,957
Wow. Even when he's not
here to defend himself.

213
00:10:45,134 --> 00:10:47,179
I can't help it, bro.
I'm sorry.

214
00:10:49,372 --> 00:10:50,808
That's probably Jamie.

215
00:10:56,474 --> 00:10:58,160
You've got to be kidding me.

216
00:10:58,273 --> 00:11:00,572
- What?
- Nothing. Stay here.

217
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,045
- Happy birthday.
- What did you do?

218
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:08,381
Damn, Turtle, you're cleaning up.

219
00:11:08,945 --> 00:11:10,997
You don't like it?

220
00:11:11,984 --> 00:11:13,602
What's so funny?

221
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,222
- We should have coagulated.
- What do you mean?

222
00:11:16,616 --> 00:11:18,103
That's my gift.

223
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:21,360
- Oh, no.
- Yup.

224
00:11:21,703 --> 00:11:24,816
- Unbelievable.
- Well, you deserve everything.

225
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:28,017
Why do you guys think
I'm such a loser?

226
00:11:28,117 --> 00:11:31,526
Loser? What are you talking about?
I knew you didn't have a car.

227
00:11:31,663 --> 00:11:33,605
- I can buy my own car.
- How?

228
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:39,545
But I thought
you'd really like it.

229
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,703
- I do like it. Of course I like it.
- Then enjoy it.

230
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,501
Come on, you want
to take me for a spin?

231
00:11:46,217 --> 00:11:47,121
Yeah.

232
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:51,052
There's something I got to do real quick.
Can I drop you at home and then see you at dinner?

233
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,791
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

234
00:11:55,165 --> 00:11:57,228
Enjoy your new car.

235
00:11:58,898 --> 00:12:01,550
Yo, E, it's Vince. I haven't
heard from you all day

236
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,803
and Charlie called.
Where you at? Call me.

237
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,636
No answer.

238
00:12:09,037 --> 00:12:10,875
Oh, jeez.

239
00:12:14,658 --> 00:12:17,468
Renoir, man.
Today is your lucky day.

240
00:12:17,473 --> 00:12:19,201
I'm parting with one
of my favorite decks.

241
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:21,968
- Giving grassers first shot at it.
- Let me check it out.

242
00:12:21,973 --> 00:12:23,126
Hello?

243
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:24,675
Eric.

244
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,709
You scared the shit
out of me.

245
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:28,678
Me too.
What are you still doing here?

246
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:32,108
Oh, I'm sorry. Your bed was just so
comfortable I didn't want to leave.

247
00:12:32,848 --> 00:12:34,122
Oh, it's 3:00.

248
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:36,113
I didn't know you had
a check-Out time.

249
00:12:36,118 --> 00:12:37,705
- No, I don't. I just-
- I can go.

250
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,689
No, it's okay. I'm just
gonna watch the pilot again.

251
00:12:39,694 --> 00:12:41,824
Oh, did you get any word
on the screening?

252
00:12:42,051 --> 00:12:44,473
Yeah, they hated him
just like you did.

253
00:12:44,551 --> 00:12:47,096
Oh, god, I'm so sorry.

254
00:12:47,196 --> 00:12:49,598
I feel bad. I shouldn't have put
that out there in the universe.

255
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:52,313
Well, I don't think that's
why they hated him, but thanks.

256
00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:54,737
Okay, well, why do you
think they hated him?

257
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:56,749
I don't know. That's what
I'm gonna try to figure out.

258
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,507
- Well, do you want a second eye?
- Sure.

259
00:13:08,545 --> 00:13:09,806
Ashley.

260
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:17,326
- I'm sorry. I'll go put pants on.
- Thank you.

261
00:13:20,947 --> 00:13:23,733
Or we could watch
it upstairs.

262
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,769
- I'll cover up.
- I can't focus.

263
00:13:27,326 --> 00:13:30,288
So just don't
let me distract you.

264
00:13:32,908 --> 00:13:35,208
We get that, all right?
Give it to them.

265
00:13:35,213 --> 00:13:38,530
But at the same time,
we've got to give them-

266
00:13:38,947 --> 00:13:40,915
Excuse me, everybody.
I'll be right back.

267
00:13:45,486 --> 00:13:47,199
What's up?
Everything okay with Vince?

268
00:13:47,312 --> 00:13:49,364
- Oh, yeah, Vince is fine.
- Oh, thank god.

269
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:51,629
I thought you were gonna tell me
you ran over him with the Ferrari.

270
00:13:51,634 --> 00:13:52,560
No.

271
00:13:52,995 --> 00:13:54,325
Then what are you doing here?

272
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,255
I was wondering if I could
talk to you for a minute.

273
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,492
Talk to me about what?

274
00:13:57,892 --> 00:13:59,570
- Career advice.
- For who?

275
00:13:59,657 --> 00:14:01,796
- For me.
- But you don't have a career.

276
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,237
- Five minutes.
- I'm in a meeting.

277
00:14:04,324 --> 00:14:06,661
Come on, Ari.
It's my birthday.

278
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:09,712
Five minutes.

279
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,314
Lloyd, tell them
I'll be right back.

280
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,051
- What's up, Lloyd?
- Hello, Mr... Turtle.

281
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:17,570
What's up?

282
00:14:17,707 --> 00:14:20,048
I'm looking for funding for
a business idea that I have.

283
00:14:20,053 --> 00:14:21,725
- Did you go to a bank?
- Yeah.

284
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,765
They laughed in my face
'cause I have no collateral.

285
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,212
- Did you tell them about your hat collection?
- Come on, Ari.

286
00:14:26,217 --> 00:14:28,937
You live with a guy who just gave you
a quarter-of-a-million-dollar car.

287
00:14:29,032 --> 00:14:31,317
- You need money, go to him.
- I'm trying to do this on my own.

288
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:34,479
Coming here asking me for money
is not doing it on your own.

289
00:14:34,484 --> 00:14:36,120
No, no, no,
I'm not asking you for money.

290
00:14:36,155 --> 00:14:38,636
I'm asking you to put me in touch with
people who invest in businesses

291
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:40,208
and I know you know
those kinds of people.

292
00:14:40,243 --> 00:14:42,797
You've stuck with Vince
through all the rough times.

293
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:46,364
Now he's on easy street and you
want to branch out on your own?

294
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:48,750
- You two have a fight?
- No.

295
00:14:49,407 --> 00:14:52,208
I just think it's time for me
to make something of myself.

296
00:14:52,243 --> 00:14:56,290
Turtle, do you know what it takes
to make something of yourself?

297
00:14:56,325 --> 00:15:00,899
I mean, come on. I worked a job
through college and grad school.

298
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:01,996
Lloyd!

299
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:04,632
- Yes, Mr. Gold?
- Hit the stack.

300
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,453
In front of people?
I'm not performing.

301
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,579
"The kingdom of Foibles."

302
00:15:08,614 --> 00:15:10,917
"The kingdom of Foibles"
written by Karen Brown.

303
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,615
"A Connecticut Yankee in King
Arthur's court meets "Die Hard."

304
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,862
A man awakes in the midst of-

305
00:15:14,897 --> 00:15:17,030
This man can quote
from the entire stack.

306
00:15:17,065 --> 00:15:20,026
That is what he's willing to
put in for his own success.

307
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:23,033
He's paying his dues.
When have you paid yours?

308
00:15:23,068 --> 00:15:25,523
I'm willing to pay them now.
And I have a great idea.

309
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,706
So do all these idiots.
Can you execute it?

310
00:15:29,257 --> 00:15:30,257
I think I can.

311
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:35,281
In this life, no one is going to
invest because you think you can.

312
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,239
Do you have a business plan?

313
00:15:37,274 --> 00:15:38,859
No. I mean,
I haven't sat down and put-

314
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:41,399
What do you need?
Office space, insurance?

315
00:15:41,434 --> 00:15:42,606
How many employees?

316
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:45,408
What do you project to earn?
What do you need to break even?

317
00:15:45,443 --> 00:15:48,058
At what point can your investors

318
00:15:48,093 --> 00:15:50,461
- see some profit?
- I don't know!

319
00:15:52,205 --> 00:15:54,015
I don't know.

320
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,567
Look...

321
00:15:57,302 --> 00:16:01,705
When my son was born, my greatest
fear was having this conversation.

322
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,036
I knew that I would give
him anything he wanted

323
00:16:05,071 --> 00:16:07,912
because he was my son
and I couldn't say no.

324
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:09,964
Which sucks, 'cause it
wouldn't help him

325
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:12,545
and he'd just end up on the street
doing heroin with the two coreys

326
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,212
because I was too much of a
pussy to teach him a lesson.

327
00:16:15,247 --> 00:16:18,389
I won't make that mistake
with you. Just say no.

328
00:16:19,675 --> 00:16:21,459
I can pull this off, Ari.

329
00:16:21,798 --> 00:16:24,028
Come back to me
when you can prove it.

330
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:32,036
No, ma'am.
I don't think that's the case.

331
00:16:32,071 --> 00:16:33,473
Why?

332
00:16:33,508 --> 00:16:37,758
Well, because skateboards
don't get flat tires.

333
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:41,662
No, I'm not calling
your son a liar whatsoever.

334
00:16:41,697 --> 00:16:43,897
Hold on.
Can you quiet that damn bird?

335
00:16:43,932 --> 00:16:45,366
- What, you don't like birds?
- No,

336
00:16:45,401 --> 00:16:48,051
I just don't like
anything that talks that much.

337
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,957
Hello? No, Mrs. Henderson,
I wasn't talking to you.

338
00:16:54,285 --> 00:16:55,285
What?

339
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,931
Why does he have to keep
yelling at the bird?

340
00:16:57,966 --> 00:17:00,741
- Because it's funny.
- Not to me it isn't.

341
00:17:01,697 --> 00:17:05,176
You think that's one of the reasons people
don't like him, 'cause he yelled at the bird?

342
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:09,098
It's one of the reasons I don't like him.
But I'm a big animal lover, so...

343
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:11,133
What are some of
the other reasons?

344
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:14,262
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

345
00:17:14,707 --> 00:17:16,101
I don't want to say it.

346
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,571
You're gonna hold back now?
You already told me you hate him.

347
00:17:18,606 --> 00:17:20,317
So what specifically
about him do you hate?

348
00:17:20,352 --> 00:17:23,154
- I think he sucks.
- You think he sucks?

349
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:26,806
Yes, and you have to think
he sucks also, Eric.

350
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:29,694
Because he really does suck.

351
00:17:29,745 --> 00:17:32,246
I mean, he seems nervous
and uncomfortable.

352
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:36,484
It makes me nervous and
uncomfortable just to watch him.

353
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:40,321
- Are you mad?
- No. I'm not mad.

354
00:17:41,189 --> 00:17:44,641
I guess that's probably why I didn't fight
more when they said they wanted to replace him.

355
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:47,624
- So he sucks.
- Yeah, okay, he sucks.

356
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:50,420
- Well, doesn't that feel better?
- No.

357
00:17:50,455 --> 00:17:52,695
It doesn't. I found him.

358
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,037
I sold this show-
His show.

359
00:17:55,072 --> 00:17:57,391
He put a year of work into it and
I can't do anything to help him.

360
00:17:57,426 --> 00:18:00,725
But you can try. You're very
persuasive when you want to be.

361
00:18:00,989 --> 00:18:02,360
You think?

362
00:18:02,673 --> 00:18:06,023
I wanted to go home with
Drama the night we met.

363
00:18:06,865 --> 00:18:09,984
What am I supposed to do?
Tell him I think he's great?

364
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:13,504
You're in sales.
That's what you do.

365
00:18:16,036 --> 00:18:19,155
Wow, it's been a whole 10 minutes since I've
been called by one of the Jonas Brothers.

366
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,048
What's up, E?

367
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,400
When you told me
to get rid of Charlie,

368
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,230
was that your honest answer or
were you just looking out for Vince?

369
00:18:24,258 --> 00:18:26,934
Vince is my client who is
producing the show with you.

370
00:18:26,969 --> 00:18:29,636
- So of course I'm looking out for him.
- Oh, come on, Ari.

371
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:33,140
Vince doesn't care about the show, you
know that. He's a producer in name only.

372
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:35,309
But Charlie is my client
who I do care about.

373
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:38,345
So if you pretended to care about him
and you were me, what would you do?

374
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,081
- What's the difference?
- I'd like to try to do something.

375
00:18:41,116 --> 00:18:43,880
What I'm capable of doing
and what you're capable of doing

376
00:18:43,885 --> 00:18:45,932
are two totally different things.

377
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:49,310
- What would you do?
- I would make a scene of biblical proportions.

378
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:53,160
I would lie, scream,
beg, borrow and steal.

379
00:18:53,195 --> 00:18:55,529
And if that somehow didn't
part Amy miller's legs,

380
00:18:55,564 --> 00:18:59,366
then I would call racism.
And I would yell for all to hear,

381
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:03,720
"You're really gonna fire my poor
black client off the show he created?!

382
00:19:03,755 --> 00:19:06,808
I'm calling NAACP,
the reverend Al Sharpton

383
00:19:06,863 --> 00:19:09,343
and the ghost
of my man Malcolm X."

384
00:19:09,378 --> 00:19:10,491
Awesome.

385
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,741
I guess I'll try my own thing.

386
00:19:14,318 --> 00:19:15,618
Good luck.

387
00:19:29,557 --> 00:19:31,448
- Is she in?
- Yes, let me tell her you're here.

388
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:33,233
- I'll tell her.
- Mr. Murphy-

389
00:19:33,268 --> 00:19:36,203
I just want you to know that what
you guys are doing is disgusting.

390
00:19:36,238 --> 00:19:39,723
Charlie busted his ass for you and you
guys are gonna toss him because, what?

391
00:19:39,758 --> 00:19:42,782
40 idiots from Modesto who
had nothing better to do today

392
00:19:42,817 --> 00:19:44,761
than to watch a pilot
in order to get a free lunch

393
00:19:44,796 --> 00:19:47,207
claim they didn't like him?
I liked him!

394
00:19:47,242 --> 00:19:50,513
That's why I signed him. And you
liked him, that's why you cast him.

395
00:19:50,548 --> 00:19:52,362
You were right.
Don't doubt yourself now.

396
00:19:52,397 --> 00:19:55,897
Charlie Williams is this
network's next superstar.

397
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:58,232
- Do you really believe that?
- Yeah.

398
00:19:58,957 --> 00:19:59,957
I do.

399
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,101
Well, I'm sorry. We don't.

400
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:07,949
There is no way that Charlie Williams
is going to be acting in this show.

401
00:20:08,944 --> 00:20:11,094
Well, then maybe you're a racist.

402
00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:19,863
I can't believe
you actually said that.

403
00:20:19,898 --> 00:20:23,983
Yeah, me either. You should have
seen the look on Amy Miller's face.

404
00:20:24,018 --> 00:20:25,761
I can only imagine.

405
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,711
Now I've gotta go see Charlie's face.

406
00:20:27,746 --> 00:20:29,631
I had to fire my brother once.

407
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,922
- Really?
- From a paper route. It was rough.

408
00:20:31,957 --> 00:20:33,759
My parents wouldn't
talk to me for a week.

409
00:20:33,794 --> 00:20:35,388
That's a good story, Ari.

410
00:20:35,423 --> 00:20:36,513
- E.
- Yeah?

411
00:20:36,548 --> 00:20:38,113
At least you went for it.

412
00:20:38,148 --> 00:20:40,125
So what? Where did it get me?

413
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,481
Some much needed lying experience.

414
00:20:42,516 --> 00:20:43,362
So?

415
00:20:43,397 --> 00:20:46,788
So next time you'll
come up with a better lie.

416
00:20:46,823 --> 00:20:48,942
- You're the one that told me to say that.
- Yeah,

417
00:20:48,977 --> 00:20:51,567
but I can't believe
you actually did.

418
00:20:51,827 --> 00:20:53,814
- Me either.
- Listen, E,

419
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:57,066
- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks, Ari.

420
00:20:57,101 --> 00:20:58,904
- Later.
- Later.

421
00:21:00,815 --> 00:21:03,472
Are you trying to teach
someone how to lie?

422
00:21:03,507 --> 00:21:04,716
What? No!

423
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,839
And how could you fire
uncle Howard?

424
00:21:08,844 --> 00:21:12,441
- You're really not going to get me a gift?
- No, I'm really not.

425
00:21:12,476 --> 00:21:17,623
Because grown men shouldn't buy other grown
men birthday gifts unless they're fucking.

426
00:21:17,658 --> 00:21:19,937
- No offense, bro.
- No offense taken, Johnny.

427
00:21:19,972 --> 00:21:21,948
But come on! It's the
kid's 30th birthday.

428
00:21:21,983 --> 00:21:24,745
E got him something.
You gotta get him something.

429
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,977
With the mood he was in all day?
No way.

430
00:21:27,012 --> 00:21:28,686
He's not in a mood anymore.

431
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:31,138
- Why not? What happened?
- Tell them.

432
00:21:31,173 --> 00:21:33,920
I was gonna wait till we sat down,
until E comes.

433
00:21:33,955 --> 00:21:36,255
No one knows where E is.
Come on, speak up.

434
00:21:38,313 --> 00:21:40,534
- I'm going back to school.
- What?

435
00:21:40,748 --> 00:21:42,165
- Yep.
- Get out of here. Really?

436
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,820
It was my idea. So he can learn
how to really run a business.

437
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:48,823
- Wow, impressive!
- Really impressive.

438
00:21:48,858 --> 00:21:51,037
- Thanks.
- You know what? Stevie?

439
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:54,042
Get us the best bottle
of wine in the house.

440
00:21:54,077 --> 00:21:55,642
- You got it, Vince.
- Very nice.

441
00:21:55,677 --> 00:21:57,955
You know, I saw on CNN that
sending a child to school

442
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,514
should run around $200,000.

443
00:22:00,732 --> 00:22:03,605
This is a birthday gift
I'd be proud to give.

444
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,740
- I got you covered.
- Jesus, Johnny!

445
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:09,319
That' great, Drama, but
this is UCLA extension-

446
00:22:09,354 --> 00:22:12,192
Business management
courses- $1292.

447
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:15,078
- Oh. It's the thought that counts.
- Yeah.

448
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:17,451
Johnny, did you know that?

449
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:20,701
- I did.
- Oh my god.

450
00:22:20,736 --> 00:22:23,221
Of course he did. I should've
let him write the check.

451
00:22:23,256 --> 00:22:26,224
- Seriously.
- Vince, are you guys ready to sit?

452
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:27,459
Yes, we are.

453
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,782
- Oh, look at here.
- Where the hell have you been?

454
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:32,574
They fired Charlie off the pilot today.

455
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:34,294
Oh man, that's awful.

456
00:22:34,329 --> 00:22:36,078
I had to tell him.
That was really awful.

457
00:22:36,113 --> 00:22:40,014
Oh, that poor bastard. I cried
every time I got fired from a pilot.

458
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:42,690
And we're off the show too, Vince.
I can't do this without Charlie.

459
00:22:42,725 --> 00:22:45,343
- No, of course not.
- You're not mad?

460
00:22:45,394 --> 00:22:48,009
Mad?
No, I just feel sorry for Charlie.

461
00:22:48,044 --> 00:22:50,764
- I mean, you and me, we're okay.
- Yeah.

462
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:52,822
- No?
- Yeah.

463
00:22:53,804 --> 00:22:56,554
- Yo, we'll meet you guys over in a sec.
- Yeah.

464
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:02,683
- What up?
- I would have liked this for me too.

465
00:23:02,718 --> 00:23:04,860
You know, prove I could pull
my own weight on this deal.

466
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:07,615
You have pulled your own weight.
That's why I am where I am.

467
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,939
The team is all good,
so what's really going on?

468
00:23:09,944 --> 00:23:10,808
What do you mean?

469
00:23:10,813 --> 00:23:12,324
- Is it about Sloan?
- What?

470
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:15,768
Want to prove you can get out from
under the Vincent Chase shadow?

471
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:17,957
Hey, look,
I'll support you all I can,

472
00:23:17,992 --> 00:23:20,392
but I can't help it if the
shadow just keeps growing larger.

473
00:23:20,427 --> 00:23:23,563
It's actually not about Sloan.
I like Ashley.

474
00:23:23,871 --> 00:23:27,208
- Really? You hated her this morning.
- Yeah, well, things changed.

475
00:23:27,243 --> 00:23:30,120
Everywhere it seems.
Turtle's going to school.

476
00:23:30,155 --> 00:23:31,059
Really?

477
00:23:31,094 --> 00:23:34,403
Everybody wants to be their own man,
I guess. But don't worry, E, it's all good.

478
00:23:34,438 --> 00:23:37,038
- I'm gonna let you buy dinner.
- Oh, thanks.

479
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,675
- This wine is insane.
- It should be. It is not cheap.

480
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,357
- Two more bottles, please.
- Really?

481
00:23:43,362 --> 00:23:46,370
- Yeah, E's buying dinner.
- Big spender!

482
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:48,288
Happy birthday, Turtle.
Here we go.

483
00:23:48,323 --> 00:23:50,289
Thank you, guys,
thank you.
