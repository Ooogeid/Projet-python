Subtitles: swsub.com

3
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:20,866
- I cannot find this place.
- Why are you too proud

4
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:23,031
to use your navigation system?
Ask yourself that.

5
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:25,610
I tried the navigation.
It can't find it either.

6
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,670
That's too bad 'cause you're about
to miss the day's last bit of sun.

7
00:01:28,872 --> 00:01:30,806
Just tell me where to turn.
I'm on Poplar.

8
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:32,768
I don't know Poplar.
Head back down the Hill,

9
00:01:32,963 --> 00:01:36,141
- I'll give you directions from sunset.
- I don't even know where the bottom is.

10
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:37,812
<i>Why did we have
to move up here anyway?</i>

11
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:39,631
'cause it's an insane house, that's why.

12
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,244
For 30 gs a month it should be.

13
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:42,818
Stop stressing about money.

14
00:01:43,184 --> 00:01:45,030
Vince says if he never
makes another dollar

15
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:48,090
his advance check from <i>Clouds</i>
can keep us in this house for 16 months.

16
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:49,759
- 18 months.
- 18 months.

17
00:01:49,968 --> 00:01:52,923
That will stop me from stressing.
Okay, wait a second,

18
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:54,630
I think I'm heading back down right now.

19
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:57,368
- Durand drive... that sound familiar?
- Yeah, turn there.

20
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:01,202
- God damn it.
- What?

21
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,035
Some girl just ran into me.

22
00:02:04,278 --> 00:02:05,908
Oh my god, I think it's Anna Faris.

23
00:02:06,318 --> 00:02:08,677
- Really?
- You know what? Let me call you back.

24
00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:10,679
What happened?

25
00:02:11,107 --> 00:02:12,858
Anna Faris just smashed into E.

26
00:02:15,163 --> 00:02:16,268
Sweet.

27
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:18,967
Did you not see me?

28
00:02:19,428 --> 00:02:20,589
I am so sorry.

29
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,993
I got distracted for a second.
It's totally my fault.

30
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,710
Well, it's okay.
it was an accident.

31
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:28,290
Would you mind not coming any closer?

32
00:02:28,813 --> 00:02:31,995
Why? You think I'm, like,
some kind of a crazy fan or something?

33
00:02:32,227 --> 00:02:34,691
No no, it's just that
I'm in a towel.

34
00:02:35,076 --> 00:02:37,328
I just got done with pilates
and I forgot a change.

35
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:40,676
And, you know, who wants to wear
sweaty clothes after a shower?

36
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:42,548
So you decided
to drive home in a towel?

37
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:44,413
- It's a little weird, huh?
- Not weird.

38
00:02:44,573 --> 00:02:47,614
It's just not very practical
in case you got in an accident.

39
00:02:50,012 --> 00:02:51,330
So what now?

40
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,864
Well, I guess I've got
to get your insurance, right?

41
00:02:55,322 --> 00:02:56,614
I don't have my wallet.

42
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:58,557
Okay, you're just a mess today.

43
00:02:58,915 --> 00:03:00,343
Yes. Yes,

44
00:03:00,895 --> 00:03:02,023
but your fly is down.

45
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:04,814
No, it's not.

46
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:08,721
I'm sorry, I just wanted
to take some of the attention off me.

47
00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:11,907
Look, I'm feeling a little exposed.
Can I give you my number?

48
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:13,603
I'm gonna be home
in, like, 10 minutes

49
00:03:13,672 --> 00:03:15,446
and then I'll give you
everything you need.

50
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,701
Yeah, that's cool.

51
00:03:16,802 --> 00:03:18,447
Let me get my phone
and get your number.

52
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:19,972
- I'm really sorry.
- That's okay.

53
00:03:20,364 --> 00:03:21,420
It'll be all right.

54
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:23,552
What time's dinner, daddy?

55
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:25,594
As soon as I'm done
with this script, sweetie.

56
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:27,046
Oh my God,

57
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:29,834
That is so funny!

58
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,040
No, you are kidding me.

59
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:36,053
That is so funny.

60
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:37,933
Oh my god, too funny.

61
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:39,283
Will you shut up?

62
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,155
Okay then.
Yes, A.S.A.P.

63
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,675
Thank you so much.

64
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,878
Well, guess who that was.

65
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:53,382
Let me see, it was Cara Grossman
and she wants to know

66
00:03:53,517 --> 00:03:56,216
if she should should get her eyebrows
waxed first or if you should.

67
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,851
It was my old producer from
<i>The Young And The Restless</i>.

68
00:03:59,022 --> 00:04:00,043
What did he want?

69
00:04:00,745 --> 00:04:02,910
- Me.
- I don't get it.

70
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,528
It's the 35th anniversary of Y&R

71
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:08,217
and they want me to reprise
my role as Kendall Scott.

72
00:04:09,846 --> 00:04:10,951
Are you serious?

73
00:04:11,112 --> 00:04:12,218
I am.

74
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:15,723
It seems that Kendall
still gets quite a bit of fan mail

75
00:04:15,861 --> 00:04:17,934
and the writers were in a bind
and they've come up

76
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,921
with a little idea that
could work for tomorrow.

77
00:04:20,013 --> 00:04:22,431
- I hope you told them no.
- I told them we'd talk about it.

78
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,625
We talked about it
so you tell them no.

79
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,503
We have not talked about it.

80
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,349
Honey, what is there to talk about?

81
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:31,730
I don't know...
tell me that it's exciting

82
00:04:31,868 --> 00:04:33,642
and that if I did it, I'd be good.

83
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:36,659
It's a soap opera. There is no good,
there's just degrees of bad.

84
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:39,466
Well, then tell me
that I would be pretty,

85
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:41,497
as pretty as the day I left the show.

86
00:04:41,565 --> 00:04:43,257
Well, you left the show
when you were 25

87
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,077
and now they shoot
everything in high def.

88
00:04:46,796 --> 00:04:48,639
You are such an asshole!

89
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:50,906
- Come on, baby.
- Yeah, right. Well, ask anybody,

90
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:53,172
you've aged a lot worse
than I have, baby.

91
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,407
Come here, honey.
Where are you going?

92
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:58,364
- To call my producer...
- For what?

93
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,959
...and tell him Kendall Scott,
town slut, is back.

94
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:08,022
What's up, boys?

95
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:11,274
For a guy who just got
into an accident, you seem happy.

96
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,820
Maybe he's got a head injury.

97
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,931
It's a fender-bender.
I'm fine. Are you nuts?

98
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,300
I hope you didn't tell Ms. Faris that,

99
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:20,185
'cause we're gonna sue
the crap out of her.

100
00:05:20,283 --> 00:05:22,379
We're not suing anybody.
there's barely any damage.

101
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:23,868
Yeah, visible damage,

102
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:26,036
but internal damage
is a whole other thing.

103
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,485
- Let it go, Drama.
- E, come on, what's up?

104
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:30,126
I don't know.
She's cute.

105
00:05:30,527 --> 00:05:32,381
- That she is.
- We had a little moment.

106
00:05:33,508 --> 00:05:34,683
- No shot.
- No way.

107
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,509
You're not a member
of the celeb club, bro.

108
00:05:37,687 --> 00:05:39,588
- It'll never happen.
- I got her number.

109
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,721
I crashed into an 80-year-old woman
once. She gave me her number too.

110
00:05:42,906 --> 00:05:44,220
Whatever.
I'm calling.

111
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,078
I bet my left nut
he could not close Anna Faris.

112
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:49,783
Gee, a bet I'd love to win.

113
00:05:50,204 --> 00:05:51,240
Shit.

114
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:53,326
What happened?

115
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:55,263
She gave me the wrong number.

116
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,895
Don't feel too bad, E.

117
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,142
You're just a regular
person, a civilian.

118
00:06:00,867 --> 00:06:02,344
Too bad she didn't hit me.

119
00:06:02,548 --> 00:06:04,068
We'd be fucking by now.

120
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:15,324
- Good morning, Ari.
- Is that smirk for me

121
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,217
or are your ben wa balls shifting?

122
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:18,994
Just wondering how you're feeling

123
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,334
about not being the biggest
star in your house anymore.

124
00:06:21,426 --> 00:06:23,165
Don't be a wiseass.
How did you know?

125
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:24,441
It's on defamer.

126
00:06:24,648 --> 00:06:25,731
You're kidding.

127
00:06:26,775 --> 00:06:28,319
Oh, Ari, be proud of her.

128
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:29,871
She's gonna light up the screen

129
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:32,082
and bring a newfound
excitement to Genoa city.

130
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:33,318
You watch that shit?

131
00:06:33,503 --> 00:06:36,091
Y&R is fourth
on my Tivo season pass priority list.

132
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,749
I haven't missed an episode in 12 years.

133
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:40,144
- That is so sad.
- You should go down to the set today.

134
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:41,917
Watch your wife's work,
be supportive.

135
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:44,286
I got my own life's work
to support, Lloyd.

136
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:56,825
Who the hell is this?

137
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:01,637
That's the underage
student she seduces, Julio.

138
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,040
Not a great picture. I've a better one.
It's my screen saver, if you wanna see.

139
00:07:05,142 --> 00:07:06,939
- Clear my schedule.
- Even your lunch?

140
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,545
I'm going to be eating
Julio's lunch today.

141
00:07:12,422 --> 00:07:13,688
Hi, Julio.

142
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:16,519
- I got it.
- Got what?

143
00:07:16,678 --> 00:07:18,659
Anna Faris's address.
Wait till she sees me

144
00:07:18,762 --> 00:07:20,167
show up on her doorstep.

145
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:22,930
What? I should pay for the car?

146
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:25,281
Is this really about the money

147
00:07:25,517 --> 00:07:27,084
or is this about your little moment?

148
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,882
- We did have a moment.
- She's an actress.

149
00:07:30,162 --> 00:07:32,802
- So what, I'm an idiot?
- No, she's a good actress.

150
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,639
Is E still bitching about
being bitch-slapped by a bitch?

151
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,906
He's rightfully upset.

152
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:40,109
Well, let it go.
We have bigger problems.

153
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,645
What's that Turtle?
Pink dot insisting on seeing a note

154
00:07:42,746 --> 00:07:44,445
before you use
Vince's credit card again?

155
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,139
- Tey discontinued his favorite weed.
- O favorite weed,

156
00:07:47,278 --> 00:07:50,252
and it's not discontinued,
it's extinct, gone forever.

157
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:52,132
Like the Yangtze river dolphin.

158
00:07:52,432 --> 00:07:55,170
I gotta wait for the cable guy.
How am I gonna do that with no weed?

159
00:07:55,216 --> 00:07:57,220
Why don't you pick up one
of the 50 kinds of weed

160
00:07:57,312 --> 00:07:59,845
- you've been living off for 20 years?
- I'm too distraught.

161
00:07:59,942 --> 00:08:02,268
What if I was to tell you
that I have a secret stash

162
00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:04,697
of the most-recently-extinct
aurora borealis

163
00:08:04,948 --> 00:08:06,100
in a box in the living room?

164
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:08,776
I would say if I wasn't
worried about appearances,

165
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,664
I would kiss you right now.
How much you got?

166
00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:12,830
Enough to make
waiting for the cable guy tolerable.

167
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:14,050
Fantastic.

168
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:15,735
You know what?
Maybe I'll stick around,

169
00:08:15,804 --> 00:08:18,301
cook us a nice lunchtime feast.
You do the shopping.

170
00:08:18,482 --> 00:08:19,584
If I pick the menu.

171
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:22,089
Done.
You in, E?

172
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,814
I can't. Got too much stuff to do today.

173
00:08:23,975 --> 00:08:25,034
I'll see you guys later.

174
00:08:26,354 --> 00:08:27,482
What's he gotta do?

175
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,586
I really miss this lovely canvas.

176
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:32,669
Well, I hope
I don't disappoint, Steven.

177
00:08:32,784 --> 00:08:34,650
It's really nerve-wracking

178
00:08:34,742 --> 00:08:37,099
when you haven't been in front
of the camera for so long.

179
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,546
Don't worry. You look as good as ever
and you will be fantastic.

180
00:08:40,837 --> 00:08:43,274
Surprise, honey.
Your husband has arrived.

181
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:45,147
Ari, what are you doing here?

182
00:08:45,308 --> 00:08:47,060
Well, I wanted to see your work.

183
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:49,712
I wanted to be the supportive
husband and meet your colleagues.

184
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,498
How are you?
Ari gold. Nice to meet you.

185
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,282
I am the man behind
this beautiful woman.

186
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,486
Your wife has
the most amazing skin.

187
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:56,890
She does, doesn't she?

188
00:08:57,673 --> 00:09:00,489
Do you think you could give
us just a couple seconds?

189
00:09:01,012 --> 00:09:02,792
Sure.
Whatever you need.

190
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:06,962
- What are you doing here?
- I heard about your scene.

191
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,562
Come on, it's a soap.
What did you think I was gonna be doing?

192
00:09:09,677 --> 00:09:11,605
I don't know,
discovering that your husband

193
00:09:11,674 --> 00:09:13,908
is really
your long-lost tranny cousin?

194
00:09:14,061 --> 00:09:15,771
Who gives a shit?
All I know is

195
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:17,872
I don't want another
man's lips on my wife.

196
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,109
- It's barely a kiss.
- And how are your kids

197
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,855
going to explain that in school

198
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:26,230
when people ask why their mommy
is on tv barely kissing Juan Valdez?

199
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,179
Sarah's best friend's mother just got
raped on <i>Criminal minds</i> last week.

200
00:09:29,271 --> 00:09:32,253
A) rape is involuntary
and b) it's prime time.

201
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:34,005
- You are such an asshole.
- Baby

202
00:09:34,424 --> 00:09:36,258
you're 30 minutes away
from getting it on

203
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:37,819
with a 19-year-old latin bullfighter

204
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:40,930
and I pass on hot pieces of ass

205
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:43,199
that throw themselves
at me all day every day

206
00:09:43,353 --> 00:09:45,886
without so much
as a cupping of an ass cheek.

207
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:48,304
You know what? I'll tell you,
if you can get one of them

208
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:50,773
to fuck you on national
television, you have my blessing.

209
00:09:50,874 --> 00:09:52,665
Ari, go back to work.

210
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:55,485
Baby, we agreed to suffer
through monogamy together.

211
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:57,646
If you love me,
you won't do it!

212
00:09:57,814 --> 00:09:59,904
If you love me,
you will get the hell out of here.

213
00:09:59,996 --> 00:10:01,700
Seriously, Ari,
you are pissing me off.

214
00:10:01,885 --> 00:10:03,428
Go back to work.

215
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:22,201
Yeah, who's this?

216
00:10:22,546 --> 00:10:24,320
The guy you smashed into last night.

217
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:28,344
Oh my God, I am so sorry
I gave you the wrong phone number.

218
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,514
- Yeah, you did.
- Oh, it was a total accident.

219
00:10:31,748 --> 00:10:32,877
Another one?

220
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:35,674
How did you find my house?

221
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:37,925
- Star maps.
- Right.

222
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:40,952
So are you, like,
here to beat me up?

223
00:10:42,026 --> 00:10:43,726
- No.
- 'Cause you do realize

224
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:46,128
it's a little nutty tracking
me down like this, right?

225
00:10:46,557 --> 00:10:48,697
If you didn't look so harmless,
I'd be worried.

226
00:10:48,866 --> 00:10:50,801
- I look harmless?
- Yeah, that's a good thing.

227
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,828
<i>I'm in the business.
I manage Vincent Chase.</i>

228
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:55,037
I'm not a crazy person.
I'm just a little pissed off.

229
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,594
I mean, you blew off the accident.

230
00:10:57,216 --> 00:10:59,442
If I can just get your insurance info,
that'd be great.

231
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,680
Yeah.
Okay, come in.

232
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:03,028
Thank you.

233
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,210
I swear I didn't do it on purpose.

234
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:15,946
The phone is new and I'm
just totally number dyslexic.

235
00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:18,059
3253, 2353...

236
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:20,357
my brain just can't
process the difference.

237
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,417
Well, I'm sorry
to just show up like this.

238
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:25,188
No, listen, I'm crazy
enough to do the same thing.

239
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:27,610
In high school
someone put gum on my locker once

240
00:11:27,725 --> 00:11:29,972
and I spent three weeks trying
to track down who it was.

241
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:33,709
- What happened?
- I got my ass kicked by Jane Nevins,

242
00:11:33,743 --> 00:11:36,011
the 300-lb resident school lunatic.

243
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:38,215
So should we do this?

244
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:41,050
- Yeah.
- Okay, here's mine.

245
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:42,510
There's my stuff right there.

246
00:11:43,722 --> 00:11:45,841
So is your car totally screwed up?

247
00:11:47,212 --> 00:11:48,893
Not too bad, actually.
Yours?

248
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,594
Completely.
I did something to the wheels.

249
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:53,796
You know, I guess
it's what I deserve.

250
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,065
I've been waiting
40 minutes for a cab

251
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,067
to take me to a meeting.
I am so late.

252
00:11:58,168 --> 00:11:59,314
I can give you a lift.

253
00:11:59,978 --> 00:12:02,019
Really?
you'd do that?

254
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:03,863
I probably should have asked
how far first.

255
00:12:03,864 --> 00:12:05,281
Oh no, it's really close.

256
00:12:05,408 --> 00:12:08,093
- No problem then.
- Okay, I'm gonna go grab my stuff.

257
00:12:18,052 --> 00:12:19,180
This is nice.

258
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:25,333
We don't get too much alone time,
just you and me, bro.

259
00:12:34,303 --> 00:12:35,478
So what do you want to do?

260
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:39,493
Well, we got no tv.

261
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:42,724
- Wanna talk?
- Sure.

262
00:12:49,118 --> 00:12:50,155
I got nothin'.

263
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,625
Yeah, me neither.
You wanna smoke?

264
00:12:53,395 --> 00:12:54,598
We promised Turtle we'd wait.

265
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:56,714
- I won't tell if you don't.
- Spark it up.

266
00:13:08,584 --> 00:13:09,916
The little bastard took it all.

267
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,382
I was right to take it, 'cause you guys
cannot control yourselves.

268
00:13:16,497 --> 00:13:18,616
When are you bringing it back?
Vince is bored.

269
00:13:18,782 --> 00:13:20,086
I'll be home soon. Relax.

270
00:13:20,283 --> 00:13:23,090
You'd better not smoke any of that
before you get back, Turtle.

271
00:13:24,382 --> 00:13:26,386
Did you hear that?
Vince feels violated.

272
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:29,009
Oh, please. I would have
to nothing but stems

273
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:30,893
if I left it
with you two degenerates.

274
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:32,217
Excuse me.

275
00:13:32,447 --> 00:13:35,664
Hey, I only have a few things.
Would you mind if I went ahead of you?

276
00:13:36,547 --> 00:13:37,701
I'll call you back.

277
00:13:38,423 --> 00:13:40,002
Sure, yeah, I'll let you go,

278
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:42,671
but if your boyfriend comes
running up here with 20 more items,

279
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,801
- I'm gonna be pissed.
- I don't have a boyfriend.

280
00:13:44,975 --> 00:13:46,196
Then by all means.

281
00:13:46,977 --> 00:13:48,169
Thanks.

282
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:50,579
Healthy living.

283
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:53,309
Me and my friend
are having a little midday fiesta.

284
00:13:54,051 --> 00:13:56,178
You know what?
Me and my friends are having one too.

285
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:57,954
Maybe we should, combine parties.

286
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:00,222
- I don't think so.
- Oh, come on.

287
00:14:00,286 --> 00:14:02,243
I guarantee our party
will be better than yours.

288
00:14:02,313 --> 00:14:03,606
Oh, yeah? Why?

289
00:14:03,827 --> 00:14:05,489
'cause it's at Vincent Chase's house.

290
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,493
Really?

291
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:14,994
- Javier.
- Yes?

292
00:14:15,447 --> 00:14:17,244
Ari gold.
Do you know me?

293
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,543
Oh, yes yes,
I know of you.

294
00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:23,005
I'd shake your hand,
but I just used my cocoa butter.

295
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:25,132
Are you interested
in representing me?

296
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:27,283
I may be.
I may be,

297
00:14:27,384 --> 00:14:29,036
but right now
I'm interested

298
00:14:29,106 --> 00:14:31,387
in talking to you
about your scene today.

299
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,922
Scene?
I have many scenes.

300
00:14:32,987 --> 00:14:35,175
There's only one scene that
I wanna talk to you about.

301
00:14:35,221 --> 00:14:37,460
- Which one is that?
- It's the one with Mrs. Gold.

302
00:14:37,974 --> 00:14:39,794
- Mrs. Gold?
- Yeah, my wife.

303
00:14:40,392 --> 00:14:43,580
- She plays Kendall Scott.
- Oh, Kendall Scott.

304
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,568
I'm sorry,
I only know character names.

305
00:14:45,822 --> 00:14:46,950
I'm a method actor.

306
00:14:47,481 --> 00:14:49,105
Well...

307
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,407
you're supposed
to kiss her on the mouth.

308
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:53,550
- Just acting.
- Don't.

309
00:14:54,285 --> 00:14:55,852
The script says that I have to.

310
00:14:55,985 --> 00:14:58,447
Look, Javier,
I can help you, okay?

311
00:14:58,641 --> 00:15:00,713
You don't want to spend
the rest of your life

312
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:03,978
having fat middle-aged women
and odd homosexual men

313
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:06,388
getting off to your work, do you?
You have bigger dreams,

314
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:08,728
I'm sure, and let me tell you,

315
00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:11,153
as anyone in this town can tell you,

316
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:13,353
I am a dreameaver, all right?

317
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:15,064
So you focus on what I'm saying

318
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:17,366
and I will have you kissing
Uggly Betty by Christmas,

319
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:19,909
but nobody gets to kiss my wife,
nobody but me.

320
00:15:21,612 --> 00:15:23,179
Oh, this is nice.

321
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:25,708
I can get used to having
a personal driver.

322
00:15:25,776 --> 00:15:28,292
I might have to take the
job just to keep the roads safe...

323
00:15:29,146 --> 00:15:30,505
... with you driving, yes.

324
00:15:31,288 --> 00:15:32,878
You know, you did stop short.

325
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,066
What are you talking about?
When you are the person

326
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,162
that crashes into another,
it's always your fault.

327
00:15:37,214 --> 00:15:39,080
that's common knowledge.
Everybody knows that.

328
00:15:39,126 --> 00:15:40,189
Yeah, I know...

329
00:15:40,952 --> 00:15:42,127
but you did stop short.

330
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:44,438
A little bit.
But still, your fault.

331
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,780
So where am I taking you anyway?

332
00:15:47,277 --> 00:15:48,782
I've got this meeting with a director

333
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:50,914
- for this movie I'm gonna do.
- Yeah? What movie?

334
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,918
- <i>Brown-eyed girl</i>.
- Okay, I've read that.

335
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:55,106
They sent it over
for Vince a ways back.

336
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:57,177
So what happened?
You didn't like it?

337
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,660
No, not for Vince.

338
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,648
Do you like it for me?

339
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:04,250
I mean, I don't know.
I read it for Vince.

340
00:16:05,102 --> 00:16:06,283
Nice save.

341
00:16:07,623 --> 00:16:09,018
Seriously, it was a long time ago.

342
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:11,098
I don't even remember specifics.
So is this it?

343
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:16,025
Can you please be honest and tell me
what you thought of the script?

344
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:17,860
What does it matter what I think?

345
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,429
Because now
I've gotta go into this meeting

346
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:22,164
and you're all in my head and...

347
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:24,042
just humor me.
I can take it.

348
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,113
Okay. All right, look, I didn't like it.

349
00:16:27,304 --> 00:16:29,360
I mean, if it were just
a regular romantic comedy,

350
00:16:29,475 --> 00:16:32,431
I'd go, "Okay, it's cute." but it's not.
It tries to be so much more.

351
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:35,880
When movies do that, I don't know,
it just... It pisses me off.

352
00:16:36,353 --> 00:16:38,081
Look, the third act...
when it looks like

353
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:40,169
they're gonna get back
together and all of a sudden

354
00:16:40,215 --> 00:16:42,380
she's taking off to start
an organic dog food company?

355
00:16:42,442 --> 00:16:44,619
I mean, come on.
It just felt broad and manipulative

356
00:16:44,711 --> 00:16:46,450
and just...
I don't know, I didn't buy it.

357
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:48,891
You really forgot the specifics, huh?

358
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:52,012
- Was that just way too honest?
- No no no.

359
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,137
No, I appreciate it.
And I really appreciate the ride.

360
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:57,010
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

361
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,235
So I guess
our insurance people will talk?

362
00:16:59,302 --> 00:17:00,603
Yeah. I guess.

363
00:17:01,444 --> 00:17:03,379
- It was nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.

364
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,487
Good luck on your meeting.
Thank you.

365
00:17:10,207 --> 00:17:13,363
So when do we get to smoke
some of this allegedly extinct weed?

366
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:14,968
When we get back to the house.

367
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:17,761
- Why can't we just smoke some now?
- 'Cause I promised my friends

368
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,255
I wouldn't smoke it without them.

369
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:20,644
That's kind of gay.

370
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,329
I thought you were gonna bring
two friends as hot as you.

371
00:17:23,385 --> 00:17:24,559
Stop. She's cool.

372
00:17:24,761 --> 00:17:26,696
- What's he saying about me up there?
- Nothing.

373
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:29,160
- Can we at least smell it?
- You can, 'cause you're hot.

374
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:30,473
Oh, eat me.

375
00:17:30,588 --> 00:17:33,558
Not even if you
bathe yourself in butterscotch.

376
00:17:33,998 --> 00:17:35,080
That smells good.

377
00:17:35,211 --> 00:17:37,238
Just pass the bowl back
and let us take one hit.

378
00:17:37,312 --> 00:17:39,132
Put the cap back on,
pass it up and shut up.

379
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:40,509
- Turtle!
- Stop sign!

380
00:17:40,577 --> 00:17:41,794
Oh, shit.

381
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:47,122
Oh, great great.

382
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,482
Way to go, retard.

383
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,558
Hello, officer.

384
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:02,860
License, registration, please.

385
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:05,878
It's in here.
I'm gonna reach for it slow.

386
00:18:07,491 --> 00:18:08,781
What's that smell?

387
00:18:12,368 --> 00:18:13,752
And action!

388
00:18:14,445 --> 00:18:16,450
- Miss Kendall.
- Come on, Julio,

389
00:18:17,394 --> 00:18:19,965
you can't honestly call me that
with a straight face now that

390
00:18:20,413 --> 00:18:21,508
you're all grown up.

391
00:18:21,749 --> 00:18:24,421
I'm sorry.
You look amazing.

392
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,295
Miss Kendall,
you were my babysitter.

393
00:18:28,216 --> 00:18:29,859
You're not a baby anymore.

394
00:18:31,314 --> 00:18:33,179
And now that we're both adults,

395
00:18:33,995 --> 00:18:36,252
I thought we could catch up
like adults.

396
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,164
- Miss Kendall...
- Julio,

397
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:40,928
what would you do to me

398
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:43,018
if I let you do anything

399
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,555
and if I promised
never to tell your Uncle Cuan?

400
00:18:47,354 --> 00:18:48,805
Tell me, what would you do?

401
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,204
I would do...

402
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,914
- this.
- Cut!

403
00:18:55,698 --> 00:18:57,793
What the fuck was that?
You're supposed to kiss her.

404
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,051
I thought it was
a little bit more romantic.

405
00:19:00,201 --> 00:19:02,573
- It's not. Let's do it again.
- I'd rather not.

406
00:19:02,896 --> 00:19:04,047
You'd rather not what?

407
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:06,352
I'd rather not kiss her.

408
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,849
What is the problem here?

409
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,864
I'm sorry, is it me?
Am I doing something wrong?

410
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,069
It's not you.
You're an incredible woman.

411
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,267
So what then?

412
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:16,960
It's him.

413
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,509
He threatened my career
and he promised me <i>Ugly Betty</i>.

414
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,305
I will be right back.

415
00:19:26,135 --> 00:19:28,254
- You are interfering with my work.
- Baby, come on.

416
00:19:28,344 --> 00:19:30,555
No matter what you say or do,
he's not gonna kiss you.

417
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:32,421
- Oh, really?
- No, it's not gonna happen.

418
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,918
You really think that?

419
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:49,282
I kissed him. It's done.
Let's shoot this.

420
00:19:52,138 --> 00:19:54,395
You don't look like
you have glaucoma to me.

421
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:56,629
- What's he saying to him?
- I don't know,

422
00:19:56,698 --> 00:19:58,357
but can he arrest all of us for this?

423
00:19:58,495 --> 00:20:00,486
I'm telling him
he kidnapped us if he tries.

424
00:20:00,924 --> 00:20:03,379
Officer, please.
We purchased that weed legally.

425
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,751
- We weren't gonna smoke it.
- Son, I don't want to hear

426
00:20:05,797 --> 00:20:08,318
another syllable out of you
unless I ask you a question.

427
00:20:09,744 --> 00:20:12,461
Now it says your truck
is registered to Vincent Chase.

428
00:20:13,258 --> 00:20:15,861
Yeah, I'm sort of his driver.
Are you a fan?

429
00:20:16,045 --> 00:20:18,717
And if I throw you in jail,
who's gonna drive your movie star down

430
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:21,206
- to bail you out?
- I don't know, sir, but please...

431
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:23,094
- Get down on your knees!
- What?

432
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,384
Down! Now!

433
00:20:25,328 --> 00:20:27,818
- Flat on your stomach!
- Are you gonna shoot me right now?

434
00:20:28,048 --> 00:20:29,062
No.

435
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:34,718
Drop it in the sewer.

436
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:45,046
Now get in your car
and get out of here.

437
00:20:45,346 --> 00:20:46,405
I can go?

438
00:20:46,543 --> 00:20:48,453
Better make it quick
before I change my mind.

439
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:50,227
Thank you, officer.
Thank you.

440
00:20:54,158 --> 00:20:55,932
- What happened?
- Are you okay?

441
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,990
He made me throw the weed
down the sewer.

442
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,271
Bet your friends
are gonna be pissed.

443
00:21:00,777 --> 00:21:02,591
Can I tape your mouth shut
if you're wrong?

444
00:21:04,992 --> 00:21:06,490
What are you doing?

445
00:21:08,394 --> 00:21:09,569
What?

446
00:21:13,664 --> 00:21:15,046
I don't believe this guy.

447
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:17,909
What is he doing?

448
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,483
- How?
- Put it on the ledge.

449
00:21:26,306 --> 00:21:27,665
Even I'm impressed.

450
00:21:33,732 --> 00:21:36,726
Never tell an actress
you don't like her work, E.

451
00:21:36,979 --> 00:21:39,236
Or an actor for that matter. It hurts.

452
00:21:39,329 --> 00:21:40,687
I know.
I'm an idiot.

453
00:21:41,102 --> 00:21:43,983
Don't feel too bad.
You were never gonna get her anyway.

454
00:21:44,098 --> 00:21:46,125
Oh, thanks, Drama.
I feel much better now.

455
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:50,660
Anna.

456
00:21:51,838 --> 00:21:53,312
Hey, Eric, it's Anna.

457
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,652
Listen,
I felt like we got cut off today.

458
00:21:57,051 --> 00:21:59,055
Would you like to have dinner
with me tonight?

459
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:01,384
Yes, sure.
Sounds great.

460
00:22:01,831 --> 00:22:04,273
- <i>I can take a cab or...</i>
- No, I'll pick you up.

461
00:22:04,484 --> 00:22:06,189
- Great. How's 8:00?
- Perfect.

462
00:22:06,396 --> 00:22:08,262
- <i>All right, cool.</i>
- I'll see you at 8:00.

463
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,536
Anna just asked me
to go out to dinner with her.

464
00:22:12,629 --> 00:22:13,711
Nice!

465
00:22:13,895 --> 00:22:15,231
- She asked you?
- Yeah.

466
00:22:16,015 --> 00:22:19,401
Make sure you pay.
End this cycle of bitchdom.

467
00:22:20,365 --> 00:22:21,623
- I'm home.
- Finally.

468
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:23,515
You'd better have something good.

469
00:22:23,953 --> 00:22:26,694
Looks like someone found
some fresh meat at the market.

470
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,969
Guys, this is Laurie,
Morgan...

471
00:22:29,297 --> 00:22:31,496
and yours, Drama.
E, I didn't know you were here,

472
00:22:31,565 --> 00:22:34,697
or else I would have found a fourth.
You and Drama can fight it out for her.

473
00:22:34,744 --> 00:22:37,811
- Thanks, Turtle.
- Hi there. Jonathan Chase.

474
00:22:37,904 --> 00:22:39,216
It's a pleasure to meet you.

475
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:45,205
Yeah, try taking that
and I'll break your fucking fingers.

476
00:22:50,823 --> 00:22:52,297
It's 8:00. What are you doing in bed?

477
00:22:52,435 --> 00:22:53,587
Long day.
I'm relaxing.

478
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:54,945
The kids eat?

479
00:22:55,682 --> 00:22:57,816
- I made lasagna.
- You did?

480
00:22:58,047 --> 00:22:59,982
It was stouffer's,
but I did the microwaving.

481
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:03,875
Look, about today...

482
00:23:03,944 --> 00:23:06,593
forget today, all right?
Let's never talk about today again.

483
00:23:06,662 --> 00:23:09,292
It's over and
I'm no longer mad...

484
00:23:10,331 --> 00:23:11,598
You're no longer mad?

485
00:23:12,081 --> 00:23:13,555
Well, I am mad,
you selfish prick.

486
00:23:13,624 --> 00:23:16,227
- and I want an apology.
- No no, your little latin joyride

487
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,518
means me never having
to say I'm sorry.

488
00:23:18,587 --> 00:23:20,614
- What, you're not gonna apologize?
- No, I'm not.

489
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:23,263
- Then how are we gonna get past this?
- I'm already past it,

490
00:23:23,355 --> 00:23:24,974
unless you're gonna go
kiss another guy.

491
00:23:25,043 --> 00:23:27,185
- then we're all good, all right?
- Well, I just may.

492
00:23:27,255 --> 00:23:29,327
They asked me to be
a series regular on the show.

493
00:23:29,692 --> 00:23:30,792
You're bluffing.

494
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:32,220
Am I?

495
00:23:33,464 --> 00:23:35,884
I'm sorry, okay?
I get jealous.

496
00:23:36,091 --> 00:23:38,694
You're possessive.
I don't want an apology for that.

497
00:23:38,878 --> 00:23:40,226
What... for what then?

498
00:23:40,618 --> 00:23:41,746
For...

499
00:23:42,675 --> 00:23:44,241
for telling me that I am old

500
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,130
and that I wouldn't
photograph in high def.

501
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:48,180
It's a legitimate concern.

502
00:23:48,571 --> 00:23:51,118
Look, I just didn't want
you doing it, all right?

503
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,813
I like the way things are.
I don't want you on television.

504
00:23:53,905 --> 00:23:56,238
I don't want some
19-year-old kissing the lips

505
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,472
that I'm supposed
to be kissing, all right?

506
00:23:58,587 --> 00:24:01,232
Listen, if you wanna go
and be a soap whore every day,

507
00:24:01,393 --> 00:24:03,973
just do it knowing that you
make your husband miserable.

508
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:08,232
You think I want to do it, Ari?

509
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:12,647
I gave up acting to have a family
and I have never ever regretted it.

510
00:24:13,775 --> 00:24:15,341
I like the way things are.

511
00:24:16,269 --> 00:24:18,180
I just wanted to have
one day of stupid fun.

512
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:19,770
With Julio down at the schoolyard.

513
00:24:19,862 --> 00:24:22,050
Well, if I'm so old and ugly,
why do you even care?

514
00:24:22,142 --> 00:24:24,186
Well, some guys are into that.
I mean, you know...

515
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,603
Tell me that I am sexy, Ari.

516
00:24:26,696 --> 00:24:27,985
Honey, you are...

517
00:24:28,849 --> 00:24:30,784
the beautiful
mother of my children.

518
00:24:33,886 --> 00:24:35,221
And I respect you.

519
00:24:41,712 --> 00:24:43,440
You little slut!

520
00:24:48,668 --> 00:24:50,833
I swear to god, my life...
I thought I was gonna die.

521
00:24:51,017 --> 00:24:53,275
My god,
you're insane.

522
00:24:54,206 --> 00:24:55,956
And thoroughly entertaining.

523
00:24:57,995 --> 00:25:00,091
Thank you so much
for coming to dinner with me.

524
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:01,957
There's no arguments...
it's on me.

525
00:25:02,164 --> 00:25:04,145
No shot.
I'm paying.

526
00:25:04,306 --> 00:25:06,751
No no. We're gonna have
to fight it out when the bill comes.

527
00:25:06,843 --> 00:25:08,110
- Oh, we will.
- Okay.

528
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,538
- So how was your meeting?
- Not good.

529
00:25:11,498 --> 00:25:13,156
I told you,
you were in my head.

530
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,436
I'm sorry. I should
have kept my mouth shut.

531
00:25:15,575 --> 00:25:18,066
No no. You know what? You were right.

532
00:25:18,595 --> 00:25:20,991
I reread the script and I hate it.

533
00:25:21,221 --> 00:25:22,350
You serious?

534
00:25:22,464 --> 00:25:24,284
I knew I was justifying, though.

535
00:25:24,514 --> 00:25:26,426
I mean,
it shoots in Italy for three months.

536
00:25:26,518 --> 00:25:29,684
How great would that be?
But it's just not that good.

537
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:31,619
So what are you gonna do now?

538
00:25:31,734 --> 00:25:33,646
I told my agent
to get me out of it.

539
00:25:33,846 --> 00:25:35,562
Oh my God,
I feel terrible.

540
00:25:35,711 --> 00:25:37,830
- This director's gonna kill me.
- No no.

541
00:25:37,968 --> 00:25:41,498
No, you were right.
And good advice is hard to come by.

542
00:25:41,935 --> 00:25:43,709
- Well...
- I actually wouldn't mind

543
00:25:43,824 --> 00:25:45,560
picking your brain
for some more advice.

544
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:47,380
Sure.

545
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,414
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hang on a second.

546
00:25:50,503 --> 00:25:51,516
Hey, baby.

547
00:25:51,678 --> 00:25:54,125
I'm probably gonna be
home in, like, two hours.

548
00:25:54,332 --> 00:25:55,530
It's my boyfriend.

549
00:25:58,132 --> 00:26:01,196
- That steak was amazing.
- Yeah, what do you season it with?

550
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:03,260
I'll never tell.

551
00:26:03,675 --> 00:26:05,540
Oh, come on.
You'll tell me.

552
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,810
No, seriously, I won't.

553
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:11,208
It's unbelievable.
This shit just keeps going and going.

554
00:26:11,323 --> 00:26:13,534
Yeah, so stop running your mouth
and keep it going.

555
00:26:13,765 --> 00:26:15,793
No, I'm serious.
We've only had, like, an eighth,

556
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,198
- and it's still...
- Actually,

557
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:20,100
I might have come across another
secret stash while I was unpacking.

558
00:26:20,403 --> 00:26:22,291
You're getting
sneakier and sneakier, Vin.

559
00:26:23,627 --> 00:26:24,894
So what now, ladies?

560
00:26:25,296 --> 00:26:26,586
Who's up for a little...

561
00:26:27,192 --> 00:26:28,389
skinny dip?

562
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:29,924
- I'm in.
- All right.

563
00:26:30,011 --> 00:26:31,806
- Anyone else?
- Be nice, Turtle.

564
00:26:31,944 --> 00:26:33,403
I'm the only shot you got tonight.

565
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:36,742
- Really? I got a shot?
- No, not really.

566
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:38,356
- Hey, what up?
- Yo.

567
00:26:38,586 --> 00:26:40,865
What's up is you missed the cable guy.
That's what's up.

568
00:26:41,003 --> 00:26:42,776
- Oh, shit.
- Nice, Turtle.

569
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:46,161
- How was the big date?
- It wasn't a date. She has a boyfriend.

570
00:26:46,368 --> 00:26:48,533
A boyfriend?
Why did she take you out to dinner?

571
00:26:48,695 --> 00:26:51,488
She wanted some career advice.
She doesn't have a manager.

572
00:26:51,787 --> 00:26:53,676
- She wants you to be her manager?
- Yep.

573
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:55,956
I told you you wouldn't fuck her.

574
00:26:56,763 --> 00:26:58,582
All right, in the pool, ladies.
Let's go.

575
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:00,834
Yeah, baby.

576
00:27:01,075 --> 00:27:03,032
Are you gonna tell me
what's on that steak?

577
00:27:03,217 --> 00:27:04,391
We'll see.

578
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:07,463
I'll print out the recipe.

579
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:11,572
She wants you
to be her manager, huh?

580
00:27:13,052 --> 00:27:14,434
Interesting.
