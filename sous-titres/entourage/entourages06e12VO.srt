You guys were right.
i feel like a new man.

16
00:01:24,434 --> 00:01:26,168
Tell us about it.

17
00:01:26,202 --> 00:01:28,503
- i don't kiss and tell.
- come on, give us something.

18
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:30,939
- like what?
- like was she a squirter?

19
00:01:30,973 --> 00:01:32,941
- you are disgusting.
- what's up, guys?

20
00:01:32,975 --> 00:01:34,242
- yo, what's up?
- he's disgusting.

21
00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:36,545
- turtle got laid last night.
- by the coed.

22
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:38,647
- really?
- is it that unbelievable?

23
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,315
No, i just thought
jamie, you know...

24
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,185
He's over her.
guy got back on the horse
and performed like a man.

25
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:45,120
- i'm impressed.
- how are things going
with you?

26
00:01:45,154 --> 00:01:47,189
Well, sloan agreed
to have lunch with me.

27
00:01:47,223 --> 00:01:49,257
Where evil will perform
like a woman.

28
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:51,426
- shut up.
- so what are you gonna say?

29
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:53,428
I'm gonna tell her i want
to get back together.

30
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:54,896
You've said that before,
haven't you?

31
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:56,898
- you don't think it'll work?
- no.

32
00:01:56,933 --> 00:01:59,634
I don't really want
relationship advice from
you anyway, drama.

33
00:01:59,669 --> 00:02:01,670
I'm not really giving you
relationship advice, e,

34
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:04,306
'cause you and sloan don't
really have a relationship.

35
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,609
But embrace it,
because freedom is
a beautiful thing.

36
00:02:07,643 --> 00:02:10,245
- and now we all have it.
- yeah, well, i don't want it.

37
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:12,180
I didn't want it either.
it was forced upon me.

38
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,317
You guys are pathetic.
i'm leaving for italy tomorrow.
is anyone coming with?

39
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:17,319
- i don't know.
- maybe.

40
00:02:17,353 --> 00:02:19,187
Free johnny is.

41
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,056
<i>you really gonna
quit acting, drama?</i>

42
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,126
Freedom, baby.
i might even have some
t-shirts made up.

43
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,461
- he's just taking
a little break.
- ( phone ringing )

44
00:02:26,496 --> 00:02:29,064
Oh, miss u.c.l.a.

45
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:31,433
You go, girl.

46
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:33,969
<i>- hey.
- hey.</i>

47
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:36,038
Look, this may be
a little direct,

48
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:39,141
But i'm feeling really insecure
that you didn't even try
and kiss me last night.

49
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:41,676
I didn't want
to be aggressive.

50
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:43,912
<i>- i like aggressive, turtle.
- i can see that.</i>

51
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:46,114
- come over.
- now?

52
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:47,916
<i>yeah, unless you're busy.</i>

53
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,951
No, i'm not busy.
it's just...

54
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:51,987
<i>- jamie?
- yeah.</i>

55
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:55,157
I will help you get
over jamie, turtle.

56
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:56,892
<i>- you think?
- i know.</i>

57
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,660
Even if we just talk.

58
00:02:58,695 --> 00:03:00,762
All right.

59
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:03,231
I'm just saying no amount
of ivy gimlets

60
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:05,233
Is gonna make sloan
fall back in love with you.

61
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,803
- i'm out.
- round two on campus?

62
00:03:07,837 --> 00:03:10,138
- something like that.
- love it.

63
00:03:10,173 --> 00:03:12,274
- learn from it.
- later, boys.

64
00:03:12,308 --> 00:03:13,642
- later.
- enjoy.

65
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:15,110
Look, e,
i agree with johnny.

66
00:03:15,144 --> 00:03:16,445
What's a lunch
going to accomplish?

67
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,246
I'm gonna make it special.

68
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,881
How are you gonna
make lunch special?

69
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,183
<i>i've got some ideas.</i>

70
00:03:21,217 --> 00:03:23,051
You're gonna need
some roofies, bro.

71
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:24,519
( stifled laugh )

72
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:26,088
So what are we here
to talk about?

73
00:03:26,155 --> 00:03:28,457
Well, this is
extremely secretive.

74
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:30,025
Everything in here is.

75
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,195
I'm buying
a very big company.

76
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:35,263
Oh, congrats.

77
00:03:35,264 --> 00:03:36,865
Which he said wouldn't
cost us anything.

78
00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:39,401
This deal will make me
the head of the largest agency

79
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:41,503
In the entire
entertainment business.

80
00:03:41,537 --> 00:03:43,305
You said it wouldn't
cost us anything.

81
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:44,773
Well, i didn't think
that it would.

82
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:46,708
He said the company
was gonna buy it.

83
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:48,477
<i>i thought that
the company could.</i>

84
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:50,245
But it's been a rough
year so, you know,

85
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:51,947
We're a little
strapped for cash.

86
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,649
But the bank has
asked me to personally
guarantee something.

87
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:56,151
$12 million.

88
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:57,686
I think it's great
that you two have

89
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,654
Such open communication
about your money.

90
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:01,023
It's not our money.

91
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:03,291
- it's her money.
- oh.

92
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:06,261
And i just put up
my money when we started
this new agency.

93
00:04:06,295 --> 00:04:07,696
And that was over
two years ago,

94
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,731
And we still haven't gotten
all of that money back yet.

95
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:11,400
And that doesn't
concern you, ari?

96
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:13,769
No, because we're gonna
make it back 50 times

97
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:15,237
- on this one.
- ( laughs )

98
00:04:15,271 --> 00:04:16,538
You don't see it this way?

99
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:19,174
Even if i did, i don't see
this as just about business.

100
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,309
Is it about ego, ari?

101
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,145
Well, i've always dreamed
about ruling the world.

102
00:04:23,212 --> 00:04:26,114
But now that i'm getting
older i would settle for
ruling hollywood.

103
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:29,084
It goes much deeper than that.
he's got enemies at this
company he wants to buy.

104
00:04:29,118 --> 00:04:31,620
<i>- i have enemies everywhere.
- who are these enemies?</i>

105
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:34,056
These are very
personal conflicts.
he wants payback.

106
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,525
- and i'm not sure
he's thinking clearly.
- what?

107
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:38,093
<i>tell me about
these conflicts, ari.</i>

108
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:40,996
- they don't matter.
- your wife seems
to think they do.

109
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,065
My wife doesn't know
how i do my business.

110
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:46,134
But you need her money
in order to buy this
business that you want.

111
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:48,236
<i>- so why do you want it?
- for revenge.</i>

112
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:50,806
- for a music department.
- for terrance.

113
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,775
For a book department
that i can pair with
filmmakers.

114
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,011
- and for lloyd.
- for spts stars.

115
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,980
Is it possible that
these people are the reason
you want to buy the agency?

116
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:00,682
Yes, he wants
to destroy them.

117
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,150
Tell her.
tell her.

118
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:05,020
Is it true?
do you want to destroy
these people, ari?

119
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:05,620
Okay, yes!

120
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:11,593
S!if i could gouge out
terrance mcquiewick's
eyeballs

121
00:05:11,627 --> 00:05:15,330
And eat them for what
he did to me, i would.

122
00:05:15,365 --> 00:05:18,400
And i would sell that
benedict arnold adam davies

123
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:22,070
Into white slavery
if we lived in a place
that had a market for it.

124
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:24,873
And lloyd,
that little queen

125
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,642
Who i welcomed
into my home

126
00:05:27,677 --> 00:05:31,380
And allowed to
play with my children
and care for my dog,

127
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,749
And who left me
for those two scumbags,

128
00:05:33,816 --> 00:05:35,917
I would tie him up
and allow the entire

129
00:05:35,952 --> 00:05:38,420
Screen actors guild
to anally rape him

130
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:40,555
If not for the fact that
i know he would enjoy it.

131
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,090
I hate 'em all.

132
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,826
And yes, i want to see
them destroyed.

133
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:47,496
But that is not why
i want this company.

134
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,665
I want--
no no, i need

135
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,336
This company because
it's good business.

136
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,472
It's good
goddamn business.

137
00:05:57,507 --> 00:06:00,242
And if i don't buy it,
someone else will

138
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:04,046
And that will be very
very bad for my business.

139
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,516
And my wife, of all people,
should know

140
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,186
That when it comes
to business, my judgment
is never clouded.

141
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,455
So please please,

142
00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:15,524
Support me like you
always have

143
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:17,926
And i will deliver for us

144
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,096
Like i always have.

145
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,498
<i>what do you think?</i>

146
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:26,068
I think it was
a good speech.

147
00:06:26,102 --> 00:06:27,269
Yeah.

148
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,304
Do what you need
to do, ari.

149
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:31,707
Really?

150
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:33,408
I love you.

151
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,612
Can we fuck in here?

152
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,782
Johnny, "melrose place"
will not stop calling me.

153
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:44,152
They like you.
like sally field,
they really really like you.

154
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,388
Well, i'm sorry you have
to deal with that, lloyd.

155
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:48,090
But i told you,
i'm passing.

156
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:49,658
Johnny, just go in
and read for them.

157
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,626
10 minutes of your life.
what do you have to lose?

158
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,295
What's left
of my soul, lloyd.

159
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,064
<i>sorry, got to go.</i>

160
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:57,933
Johnny, maybe you
should just test.

161
00:06:57,967 --> 00:07:00,068
If you get it you can
turn it down if you
really don't want it.

162
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:01,937
I don't want it.
really.

163
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:03,638
Look at me.

164
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,041
Vince, i have
one pair left.

165
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:08,143
- oh, awesome. thanks.
- you're welcome.

166
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,112
- vince, what's up?
- hey, matty.

167
00:07:10,146 --> 00:07:11,847

- how you doing, buddy?

168
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,115
- good to see you, man.
- good to see you.

169
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:15,517
- hey, matt.
- hey.

170
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:17,419
Johnny.

171
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:19,921
Listen, man, did you
get the stuff that i
sent over to ari?

172
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:22,424
It's the foundation
i'm working with--
the one by one foundation.

173
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,059
- the kids' foundation.
- oh, yeah yeah.

174
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:25,994
It's at the house.
i haven't had a chance
to look at it.

175
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,430
You haven't looked
at it yet?

176
00:07:28,464 --> 00:07:30,632
- no, i've been busy.
- with what?

177
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,602
I'm doing the new
darabont movie.

178
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:37,105
- don't be afraid
to get involved, vince.
- i'm not.

179
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,474
We're raising money for
children all over the world.
it's for kids.

180
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:41,710
- it sounds good.
- it is good.

181
00:07:41,778 --> 00:07:44,813
- you should look at it.
- i will.

182
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:48,150
- you can look at it too.
- yeah, i will, matt.

183
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:50,485
- i'll see, you, man.
- see you later.

184
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,654
It's for kids.

185
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,790
Wow, he's intense.

186
00:07:54,824 --> 00:07:56,858
<i>¶ yeah ¶</i>

187
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:02,230
<i>¶ cruising on a grey snake
till my dying day ¶</i>

188
00:08:02,265 --> 00:08:06,368
<i>¶ checking out your henhouses
all along the way... ¶</i>

189
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,871
- where are we going?
- it's a surprise.

190
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,107
- how far is it?
- it's a surprise.

191
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:14,576
I have to be back by 2:30.

192
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,545
You're not gonna be,
so surprise.

193
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,747
- no, i'm serious.
- me too.

194
00:08:18,781 --> 00:08:20,916
Come on, eric.
no fooling around.

195
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:22,351
I have something
i have to do.

196
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:24,019
- really?
- yeah.

197
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:25,687
That's my fault.
i wasn't thinking.

198
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:28,056
- but this is really important.
- what is?

199
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,225
I can't tell you
till we're there.

200
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,960
( laughs, groans )

201
00:08:31,994 --> 00:08:33,795
Come on, what is it?

202
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,564
I can't tell you
till we're there.

203
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,833
Anyway, you can change
your appointment.

204
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:40,035
( sighs )

205
00:08:40,069 --> 00:08:42,671
Is this really important?

206
00:08:42,705 --> 00:08:44,606
Yes it is.

207
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,375
Okay.

208
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:48,210
- thank you.
- you owe me.

209
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:49,778
Always.

210
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:54,249
<i>¶ you're the only
one i need ¶</i>

211
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,052
<i>¶ ain't nobody
make me feel ¶</i>

212
00:08:57,086 --> 00:09:01,089
<i>¶ the way you're
making me feel ¶</i>

213
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:05,627
<i>¶ and, girl, you know
this love is real... ¶</i>

214
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:08,630
- wake up.
- i'm up.

215
00:09:08,664 --> 00:09:11,033
- you're like kissing a corpse.
- i'm sorry.

216
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:13,268
You're not
attracted to me?

217
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:16,471
Are you kidding?
you're smoking.

218
00:09:16,506 --> 00:09:18,340
- yeah?
- yeah.

219
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:20,742
Maybe you just need
to loosen up a little.

220
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:22,477
Relax.

221
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,751
Now you're
getting somewhere.

222
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:31,987
- yeah?
you like that?
- uh-huh.

223
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,289
You like that?

224
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:36,258
Yeah.

225
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:42,330
( sighs )

226
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:45,167
I can't believe i can't
get you to stop thinking
about her.

227
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:47,002
I'm sorry.

228
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,171
She hasn't called me
back in three days.

229
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:51,006
Maybe she doesn't
want to talk to you.

230
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,909
No, i think she's pissed
i didn't try to stop her
from going.

231
00:09:53,943 --> 00:09:55,510
Or that i didn't go
with her, you know?

232
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,345
I don't know her,
turtle.

233
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,314
I should have
gone with her.

234
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,950
Well, maybe you
should go now.

235
00:10:01,984 --> 00:10:04,286
I'm really sorry.

236
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,621
I'll live.

237
00:10:06,656 --> 00:10:09,391
Yeah, but i got you
all worked up

238
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:12,094
And now i'm just
abandoning you.
that's not fair.

239
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:14,963
You want me to go down
on you or something?

240
00:10:14,997 --> 00:10:16,865
( scoffs )

241
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,234
- lloyd. lloyd.
- yes?

242
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:21,002
Ari gold's on his way
up here again.

243
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,373
What?
why is this happening?

244
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:27,442
Why does ari gold
keep coming up here?

245
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:31,913
Adam, i gave up my life
to work with you.

246
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:34,182
You two make
a cute couple.

247
00:10:36,252 --> 00:10:38,854
Adam, talk to me, please.

248
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,157
I think we're merging
or ari's buying us.
i don't know.

249
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:43,959
Oh my god.
what will that mean for me?

250
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:46,828
I know what
it'll mean for me.

251
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,967
You know what i'm looking
forward to, terrance?

252
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:53,568
No, what's that?

253
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:55,570
Walking through this place
terminator style

254
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:58,073
And eradicating
all the dead weight.

255
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,242
Unlike you,
i have a soft heart.

256
00:11:00,276 --> 00:11:01,943
( laughs )
soft as a diamond.

257
00:11:01,978 --> 00:11:04,212
Okay, can we dispense
with the pleasantries?

258
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,149
You know, my business
hasn't done too badly
over the years.

259
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:09,184
But it can be doing
so much better.

260
00:11:09,218 --> 00:11:11,720
And it will be doing better
once we're done here.
so let's move on.

261
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,356
You were always so certain
that you knew better than i.

262
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,058
Barbara's right,
seeing is believing.

263
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,161
But when i trim
the fat off this shithole

264
00:11:19,195 --> 00:11:21,129
And put it all under
the miller gold banner,

265
00:11:21,164 --> 00:11:24,566
You will see what it
could have been if you
would have kept me around.

266
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,935
Oh, i look forward to that.

267
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:30,138
Except of course it won't be
under the miller gold banner.

268
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:31,773
I don't follow.

269
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:35,177
You obviously havet read
the addendum in the contract.

270
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:37,746
- what addendum?
- it was added in
this morning.

271
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,282
It's nothing really.
it's just i want assurances

272
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:43,251
That the 40-year-old
terrance mcquiewick agency,

273
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,221
Which i founded, doesn't
somehow lose its name.

274
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:49,024
Well, that's not really
for you to decide.

275
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:50,325
The addendum says it is.

276
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,927
Are you joking?

277
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,029
Ari, we've only had
our name for two years.

278
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:56,498
- how attached
to it can you be?
- i like gold, okay?

279
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:59,267
You can't pull this shit
last second.

280
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,336
I wouldn't have
thought i needed it.

281
00:12:01,371 --> 00:12:03,338
My lawyers
didn't think i did.

282
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:06,675
They said, "what idiwoud
of a brand name

283
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:08,610
That is synonymous
with entertainment

284
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,779
And has been for nearly
four decades?"

285
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:14,082
But i woke up
in a terrible sweat
last night.

286
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:15,884
And i thought,
"my god.

287
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:19,554
I know what idiot
would want that-- him."

288
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:22,024
You got your price,
you have no other say.

289
00:12:22,058 --> 00:12:23,658
- ari.
- i'm out of here.

290
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:26,428
Come on, ari.
don't let your
unchecked ego

291
00:12:26,462 --> 00:12:28,797
Bring you
to your knees again.

292
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,600
Ari, come back and sign
the fucking papers.

293
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:34,336
Lloyd lee, you got
a new lease on life.

294
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,138
You too, scumbag.

295
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,573
<i>- drama: lloyd. lloyd.
- yeah, johnny?</i>

296
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:41,743
I said it doesn't matter
because it isn't about
the money.

297
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:44,679
Tell 'em i said thank you
but no thank you.

298
00:12:44,714 --> 00:12:47,416
<i>- okay.
- all right, i'll talk
to you later.</i>

299
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,817
Okay.

300
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,519
What happened?

301
00:12:50,553 --> 00:12:52,688
They're willing to push
my quote 10 gs.

302
00:12:52,722 --> 00:12:54,990
You're making 'em want you.
what are you thinking?

303
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,325
I'm thinking about
you and me

304
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,661
Scouring the italian
countryside.

305
00:12:59,662 --> 00:13:01,263
I can't think
of anything better.

306
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:03,298
You know i'm gonna be
working most of the time?

307
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:06,001
Yeah, you've still got to eat
and blow off some steam.

308
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:07,969
True. i just want to make
sure you're gonna be okay.

309
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:10,639
- i don't want you
to have any regrets.
- i'm great, bro. really.

310
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:13,175
I might even take up
as a cobbler like daniel day.

311
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,743
Now that would
be interesting.

312
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:17,012
( phone rings )

313
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:18,980
Ciao.
the chase residence.

314
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:20,449
<i>hey, it's matt damon.</i>

315
00:13:20,483 --> 00:13:23,719
Hey, matt, it's johnny.
what can i do for you?

316
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:26,421
You can write a big check
to the one by one foundation.

317
00:13:26,456 --> 00:13:29,091
I'd love to, but my future's
a little uncertain right now.

318
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,360
- i'm out of the business.
- were you in the business?

319
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,828
I was on a hit show
for three years.

320
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:35,397
<i>- what happene  they fired ?
- no, i left by choice.</i>

321
00:13:35,431 --> 00:13:38,133
Well, listen, john,
there are millions
of helpless children

322
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:39,601
With much much
bigger problems.

323
00:13:39,635 --> 00:13:40,902
Well, yeah,
of course.

324
00:13:40,937 --> 00:13:43,438
Is vince there?
did he look at
the materials yet?

325
00:13:43,473 --> 00:13:45,173
Hang on.
it's damon.

326
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:47,542
He wants to know about
that charity thing.

327
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,011
He must have slipped out.

328
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:52,013
But i can see the brochures
opened up here on the table.

329
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:53,882
Put him on the fucking
phone, john.

330
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,018
Okay.

331
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:57,753
Sorry, he jason bourned me.

332
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,157
( sighs )
hey, matt.

333
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:04,092
I was just looking
over the stuff.

334
00:14:04,127 --> 00:14:06,395
<i>- pretty moving shit,
isn't it?
- very.</i>

335
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,996
Okay, so can i
count on you?

336
00:14:08,031 --> 00:14:09,931
Just let me know
what i can do.

337
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:11,400
<i>i'll tell you
what you can do.</i>

338
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,903
<i>we've got some trips coming
up to cleveland, ohio.</i>

339
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,472
Feeding america, one of
our partners, is running
a food bank there.

340
00:14:17,507 --> 00:14:20,308
I need a other celebrity
to go with me to draw
attention to the fact

341
00:14:20,343 --> 00:14:22,711
That one out of six
american children--

342
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:25,280
One out of six,
are food insecur

343
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:26,982
Do you even know
what that means, vince?

344
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:29,751
It means they don't
know where their next
meal is coming from.

345
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,454
One out of six americans.
it's fucking shameful.

346
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:34,990
Yeah, i'm leaving
for italy tomorrow.

347
00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:36,725
You know what?
fuck the american kids.

348
00:14:36,726 --> 00:14:38,627
Let them starve.

on your vacation.

349
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:41,196
No, it's not a vacation.
i'm working.

350
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,166
- get off your arse, vince.
- that's bono, vince.

351
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,535
Oh, hey, bono.

352
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:50,405
You know, it doesntake muchg
effect here, vince.

353
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:51,973
<i>- yeah.
- matt: i'll tell you what--</i>

354
00:14:52,008 --> 00:14:54,476
When you're done with
your frank darabont movie,

355
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,379
- i'm gonna take you
on a trip, okay?
- yeah, for sure.

356
00:14:57,413 --> 00:14:59,514
<i>in the near term
i would like a check.</i>

357
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:02,084
Okay.

358
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:04,920
- do what's right, vince.
- don't be a cheapskate, man.

359
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:07,255
Do it today, okay?
don't make me wait.
i'm going to be waiting.

360
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:09,257
-we'll both be waiting.
- see you, vince.

361
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:10,759
<i>( door shuts )</i>

362
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,594
Yo, what's up?

363
00:15:12,628 --> 00:15:14,896
I'm going to new zealand.

364
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:16,498
Hey, what happened
with the coed?

365
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:19,935
Nothing.
not today or last night.

366
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:21,837
You lied?

367
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:25,207
Sorry.  i love jamie.
i don't want to be with
anybody else.

368
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:27,476
I got a 6:00 p.m. flight.

369
00:15:30,813 --> 00:15:33,248
Well...

370
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:36,585
I guess freedom is ours
and ours alone, johnny.

371
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:38,987
Yeah.

372
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:42,357
What's wrong?

373
00:15:42,392 --> 00:15:45,394
I may have been lying
to myself too, bro.

374
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:47,062
I'm an actor.

375
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:49,231
I've got to get
to that meeting.

376
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:54,269
Eric:
we got lucky today.
basically perfect weather.

377
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:56,538
Yeah.

378
00:15:56,572 --> 00:15:59,808
God, it feels like forever
since we were last here.

379
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,309
It was only
a couple years ago.

380
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,778
More like three.

381
00:16:02,812 --> 00:16:05,080
We spent two
nights at shutters.
that was a good weekend.

382
00:16:05,114 --> 00:16:06,615
It was for me.

383
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:09,584
You got so sunburned you
couldn't breathe without pain.

384
00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:12,120
Maybe i glorified it
a little bit.

385
00:16:12,155 --> 00:16:14,189
No, it was amazing.

386
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,325
So what are we doing here?

387
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,995
Is vince thinking about buying
this place or something?

388
00:16:19,996 --> 00:16:21,496
No.

389
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:23,265
So what then?

390
00:16:23,299 --> 00:16:27,035
I just wanted to remind you
how good we could be together.

391
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:31,440
Wow.

392
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:33,508
You've got to be kidding me.

393
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:36,144
- sloan.
- eric, i canceled
on someone.

394
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:37,579
Was it really
that important?

395
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:40,449
It's the guy i'm seeing
and yes, i like him.

396
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:42,117
Well, i still love you.

397
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:45,787
- i want to go home.
- sloan.

398
00:16:45,822 --> 00:16:48,256
Eric, we've been over this.

399
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,492
I want to go home now.

400
00:16:55,998 --> 00:16:58,266
Hey, jame,
it's me.

401
00:16:58,301 --> 00:17:00,869
I just wanted to let you know
i'm on my way to see you.

402
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,472
We need to talk
face to face.

403
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:06,208
I'm taking off in a little,
so please call me if
you get this.

404
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:15,117
- auckland. you traveling to?

405
00:17:15,151 --> 00:17:18,854
- how long is the flight?
- about 14 and a half hours.

406
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:20,188
Sweet.

407
00:17:20,223 --> 00:17:23,425
This lying scumbag
piece of shit.

408
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,793
What did you
expect from him?

409
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:27,362
I expected him to honor
the deal that he agreed to.

410
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:30,065
- he was never going to.
- he has never honored
anything.

411
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:31,733
But you still want this.

412
00:17:31,768 --> 00:17:33,869
More than i want
my wife to crave pussy.

413
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:37,606
But i will not be controlled
by that rotting old douchebag.

414
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,675
<i>- i was for too long.
- it's a fair deal though, ari.</i>

415
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,744
For whatever reason,
he's being more than fair.

416
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:45,013
And you know that
if you drop this ball

417
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:47,382
The whole town
is gonna dive for this.

418
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:50,519
<i>- what the hell?
- he's weak.</i>

419
00:17:50,553 --> 00:17:53,155
I don't know why, but he is.
just get the deal done.

420
00:17:53,189 --> 00:17:55,223
- andrew.
- terrance.

421
00:17:55,258 --> 00:17:57,759
Nice to see you.
didn't realize you were
still in the business.

422
00:17:57,794 --> 00:17:59,761
- die.
- not for you.

423
00:17:59,796 --> 00:18:02,864
Not for any tv agents.
hello, ari.

424
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:05,901
I should kick your ass
for wasting my time.

425
00:18:05,935 --> 00:18:09,504
Remember when you first
came to work for me?

426
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,473
We used to go spar
at my gym.

427
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,275
I'd kick your ass.

428
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:15,577
You were my boss.
i let you win.

429
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:17,713
I could still kick
your ass and you know it.

430
00:18:17,747 --> 00:18:20,716
Listen, you crawled
over here for a reason.
what is it?

431
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,285
I want to make
this deal work.

432
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,921
<i>well, then i suggest
that you go find a buyer</i>

433
00:18:25,955 --> 00:18:27,756
Who will let you
push them around.

434
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,925
'cause it ain't
gonna be me.

435
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:31,793
I want you to buy it.

436
00:18:31,794 --> 00:18:33,195
<i>why?</i>

437
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:35,831
Because you miss having some
sort of control over me?

438
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,734
Listen, i'm smart enough
to know that i never had
control over you.

439
00:18:38,768 --> 00:18:42,070
No.  not while
i was working for you.

440
00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:43,972
<i>or shall i say with you?</i>

441
00:18:43,973 --> 00:18:46,408
I was your number-one asset.

442
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:49,077
We used to laugh at all
those other dickheads.

443
00:18:49,112 --> 00:18:51,146
But you became one
when you threw me out

444
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,048
<i>of the company
that i built.</i>

445
00:18:53,082 --> 00:18:55,984
Look, let's put
the past behind us.

446
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:59,654
The future is yours.
don't destroy my legacy
out of spite.

447
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:02,157
Admit that you destroyed
me out of spite,

448
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:05,027
Out of bitterness
and out of jealousy.

449
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,329
Is that what
all this is about?
you want me to apologize?

450
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:11,099
Poor hurt little boy
still pines for his
daddy's approval?

451
00:19:11,134 --> 00:19:13,969
I became too big for you
and you couldn't handle it.

452
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:16,271
No, i couldn't handle
your rotten ego

453
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:18,473
Or your extraordinary
salary demands.

454
00:19:18,508 --> 00:19:19,908
Bullshit.

455
00:19:19,942 --> 00:19:22,944
So this is why you won't
let me keep my name?

456
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:25,514
If you don't like it,
you can go find someone else.

457
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:27,582
No, i don't want
anyone else.

458
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:31,186
You're the only one who
can take this company forward
for the next 50 years.

459
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,456
- well, then apologize.
- i just did.

460
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,858
It was a mistake

461
00:19:36,893 --> 00:19:39,061
That i kicked you out,
ari, all right?

462
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:42,330
I was just
feeling unneeded.

463
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:46,201
Well, you were needed.

464
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:49,871
Well, you know you're
going to grow old
someday, ari.

465
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:52,941
Hopefully
you'll find someone

466
00:19:52,975 --> 00:19:55,744
Who'll be able to help
you do it gracefully.

467
00:19:59,749 --> 00:20:01,383
I'll let you
keep your name.

468
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:09,224
( chuckles )
make it last.

469
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:14,296
You've got a roomful of people
that are very excited

470
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:16,698
That you changed
your mind and decided
to come in, johnny.

471
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:19,034
Well, i'm just glad you guys
are still willing to see me.

472
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:22,270
Truth is, phil begged
us to see you again.

473
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,172
And i'm--

474
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:28,176
I'm questioning
the reluctance.

475
00:20:28,211 --> 00:20:30,078
<i>are you not
feeling this role?</i>

476
00:20:30,113 --> 00:20:32,547
- no no no.
- well, what then?

477
00:20:32,582 --> 00:20:36,284
Well, for a minute there
i didn't think i wanted
this anymore.

478
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,020
But then it hit me.

479
00:20:38,054 --> 00:20:40,422
What i don't want anymore
is the rejection.

480
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,092
<i>18 years of it
has taken its toll.</i>

481
00:20:44,127 --> 00:20:47,029
I was on this show
once before.

482
00:20:47,063 --> 00:20:50,866
And i was on another series
for the past 87 episodes.

483
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,703
I've done over 140 guest
spots on tv and other movies,

484
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:57,672
16 plays, 39 commercials--

485
00:20:57,707 --> 00:20:59,908
Yet still you haven't
seen enough

486
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:02,010
To just offer me the part.

487
00:21:02,045 --> 00:21:05,447
Still you make me
sing for my supper.

488
00:21:05,448 --> 00:21:07,949
Hey, if you
don't want to...

489
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:10,252
No, it doesn't matter
if i want to.

490
00:21:10,286 --> 00:21:12,454
I have to.

491
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:14,523
There you go.
that's the spirit.

492
00:21:14,557 --> 00:21:16,258
Roll this.
do it, johnny.

493
00:21:19,062 --> 00:21:22,130
( shouts )
here we go!

494
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:24,566
Yeah, they basically gave me
the part in the room, bro.

495
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,803
- yeah?
- yeah, yagota said
i was pitch perfect.

496
00:21:27,837 --> 00:21:30,472
I even got a sincere thumbs up
from that jerkoff director.

497
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:32,641
You should have stopped caring
a long time ago, johnny.

498
00:21:32,675 --> 00:21:34,209
<i>no shit.</i>

499
00:21:34,243 --> 00:21:36,378
So i guess this means
i'm going to italy alone
then, huh?

500
00:21:36,412 --> 00:21:39,047
Well, i don't have
an official offer and i don't
want to jinx it,

501
00:21:39,082 --> 00:21:41,850
But sorry, bro.
looks like you're solo.

502
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,785
I'm proud of you, johnny.

503
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,320
Thanks, vince.

504
00:21:45,355 --> 00:21:47,422
<i>- later.
- later.</i>

505
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,834
I don't know why
you're so angry.

506
00:21:58,868 --> 00:22:00,769
I said i was sorry.

507
00:22:00,803 --> 00:22:02,938
You rejected me,
i feel bad enough.

508
00:22:02,972 --> 00:22:04,673
You should be
used to that by now.

509
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,608
Look, i was wrong,
all right?

510
00:22:06,642 --> 00:22:09,077
The guys told me
you were over me
and i didn't believe them.

511
00:22:09,112 --> 00:22:12,147
<i>and you usually listen to
every word the guys say.</i>

512
00:22:12,181 --> 00:22:14,049
I know.

513
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,218
It's just that even though
we've been apart for
the last three years,

514
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:19,521
I always believed
that one day i'd have
you, a house, kids.

515
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:22,357
- you mean we.
- i don't follow.

516
00:22:22,392 --> 00:22:25,260
We would have a house
and kids.

517
00:22:25,294 --> 00:22:28,597
You're a selfish prick.
you follow that?

518
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,535
Why is it so selfish
because i'm trying to tell
you i want to be with you?

519
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:36,238
Because last time you
convinced me it was forever

520
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,206
And then took off with your
buddies five minutes later.

521
00:22:38,241 --> 00:22:41,076
I'm sorry.
i was trying to get
my business going.

522
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,879
- you took me for granted.
- i know.

523
00:22:43,913 --> 00:22:46,748
Eric, why are you
doing this to me?

524
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,050
Because i love you.

525
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:50,419
I will not get lured
back into this.

526
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:51,987
I can't trust you.

527
00:22:52,021 --> 00:22:55,490
You love to have a girlfriend,
but on your terms.

528
00:22:55,525 --> 00:22:58,260
You're never gonna
be able to commit,
not to anyone.

529
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,395
That is not true.
i will commit to you
right now.

530
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,831
- eric, stop.
- i swear to god.

531
00:23:02,865 --> 00:23:05,100
- i'll marry you.
- you'll marry me?

532
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,669
Yes, i will get in that car
right now, drive to vegas

533
00:23:07,704 --> 00:23:09,404
And commit to you
for the rest of my life.

534
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:13,008
Really?  have you even
thought about this?

535
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:15,744
Yeah, i have.

536
00:23:15,778 --> 00:23:18,547
And this time
i swear on my life

537
00:23:18,581 --> 00:23:21,283
It'll be forever.

538
00:23:35,431 --> 00:23:37,566
Jesse.
how've you been?

539
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,102
I've been--

540
00:23:40,103 --> 00:23:43,038
Great. i'm back
and you're fired.

541
00:23:43,072 --> 00:23:44,373
- ( paintballs shooting )
- hello all.

542
00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:47,709
No need to run.
your fates have already
been sealed.

543
00:23:47,744 --> 00:23:50,112
- you're safe.
- oh my god.

544
00:23:50,146 --> 00:23:51,947
You're safe,
for now.

545
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:54,149
Hello, nice to see you.
who's your best client?

546
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,284
Um...

547
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,919
Jesus!

548
00:23:57,954 --> 00:24:00,922
I represent
"jon and kate plus 8."

549
00:24:03,626 --> 00:24:05,927
Where are you, davies?

550
00:24:08,131 --> 00:24:11,600
Ari, i'm already packing
to save myself the indignity.

551
00:24:11,634 --> 00:24:13,735
That's too bad.

552
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,204
Ari, jesus christ!

553
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:19,074
- have you lost
your mind, ari?
- ( laughing )

554
00:24:19,108 --> 00:24:21,243
Now where's lloyd lee?

555
00:24:21,277 --> 00:24:23,078
Mr. lee knewhat you
were coming, mr. gold.

556
00:24:23,112 --> 00:24:24,646
He decided not to wait
for your arrival.

557
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,281
Now why don't
i believe you?

558
00:24:26,315 --> 00:24:27,716
( gun fires )

559
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,785
Now, lloyd, maybe
you're not here.

560
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:31,086
<i>maybe you are.</i>

561
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,655
Either way, you have
nothing to fear

562
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:36,692
Because i'm not
gonna kill you.
i love you.

563
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:39,661
<i>you see, even though
you betrayed me,</i>

564
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:42,230
<i>you were the best slave
that i ever had.</i>

565
00:24:42,265 --> 00:24:45,734
I mean, who could
possibly replace

566
00:24:45,768 --> 00:24:48,236
The way that you picked up
my dry-cleaning?

567
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:50,005
No one.

568
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:53,642
Who could better the way
you picked up my dog's shit?

569
00:24:53,676 --> 00:24:56,478
And if i liked
short, fat men

570
00:24:56,512 --> 00:24:57,946
Sucking on my dick,

571
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:01,316
I'm sure that no one could
do it better than you either.

572
00:25:01,351 --> 00:25:03,985
So return to the king

573
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,954
Or exile yourself

574
00:25:05,988 --> 00:25:07,989
From this town forever.

575
00:25:08,024 --> 00:25:10,592
You have until the end
of the day tomorrow

576
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:13,862
To agree to be
rebranded mine.

577
00:25:13,896 --> 00:25:16,131
( gun firing )

578
00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:22,037
<i>woman:
welcome aboard,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

579
00:25:23,406 --> 00:25:25,173
Excuse me, ma'am.

580
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:27,175
If there's a seat left with
an open one next to it,

581
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,378
- i'd love to grab that.
- as would i.

582
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,813
I'm sorry, but i think
the flight is full.

583
00:25:31,848 --> 00:25:35,117
- awesome.
- ( phone rings )

584
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:42,157
Jamie.  jesus, why
haven't you called me?

585
00:25:42,191 --> 00:25:44,993
<i>- turtle, where are you?
- i'm on my way to you.</i>

586
00:25:45,028 --> 00:25:46,628
I don't want you
to do that.

587
00:25:46,662 --> 00:25:48,463
<i>i don't want
to see other people.</i>

588
00:25:48,498 --> 00:25:50,766
<i>- i can't believe you'd
think that i would.
- turtle.</i>

589
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,634
Excuse me, sir.i'm sorry, ya
have to get off your phone.

590
00:25:52,668 --> 00:25:54,669
- we're preparing
for takeoff, okay?
- just one minute.

591
00:25:54,704 --> 00:25:55,804
- sir.
- just one minute.

592
00:25:55,838 --> 00:25:57,939
<i>turtle, please
don't come here.</i>

593
00:25:57,974 --> 00:26:01,676
<i>i know i said you should
see other people because i
don't want you to resent me.</i>

594
00:26:01,711 --> 00:26:05,213
- but i was just being weak.
- weak? how?

595
00:26:05,248 --> 00:26:09,184
The truth is i don't want
to end up resenting you.

596
00:26:09,218 --> 00:26:11,353
Why would you resent me?

597
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:13,488
Because i could be
gone for a year.

598
00:26:13,523 --> 00:26:16,558
And if the show is successful
i could be gone for five.

599
00:26:16,592 --> 00:26:18,427
So you want to see
other people?

600
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:21,563
I don't know what i want.
but i've done the long-
distance thing before

601
00:26:21,597 --> 00:26:23,699
And i ended up getting
really really hurt.

602
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:26,501
<i>and i would never want that
to happen to either of us.</i>

603
00:26:26,536 --> 00:26:28,770
It's not like
i won't come see you.

604
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:31,373
<i>you've worked so hard this
year to get your life going.</i>

605
00:26:31,407 --> 00:26:33,909
You can't be flying
back and forth to new zealand.

606
00:26:33,943 --> 00:26:36,545
<i>- i can make it work.
- it wouldn't work.</i>

607
00:26:36,579 --> 00:26:39,614
And if we're ever gonna
have a chance in the future,

608
00:26:39,615 --> 00:26:41,883
We shouldn't try.

609
00:26:43,386 --> 00:26:46,288
Wow.
i didn't see this coming.

610
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:49,091
I really do love you.

611
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,960
Sir, you need to get off
the phone right now.

612
00:26:51,994 --> 00:26:54,963
Okay then.

613
00:26:54,997 --> 00:26:58,300
Turtle, i'm sorry.

614
00:26:58,334 --> 00:27:00,068
Yeah.

615
00:27:03,573 --> 00:27:06,341
<i>( engines powering up )</i>

616
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:09,010
I've got to get
off this plane.

617
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:11,613
I've got to get off
this plane.

618
00:27:11,647 --> 00:27:13,315
I'm sorry,
that's not possible.

619
00:27:13,349 --> 00:27:15,717
The door is closed
and we've already pulled
away from the gate.

620
00:27:15,752 --> 00:27:18,520
I can't go to new zealand.
i've got to get off
this plane now.

621
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,956
Sit down.
put your seat belt on.

622
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,624
What if i yell bomb?

623
00:27:22,658 --> 00:27:25,060
Then you can get off
the plane and you can
go straight to jail

624
00:27:25,094 --> 00:27:27,696
And pay a $250,000 fine.

625
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,765
( sighs )

626
00:27:33,503 --> 00:27:35,604
Thank you.

627
00:27:39,475 --> 00:27:41,343
Hey, vince,
we got to roll.

628
00:27:41,377 --> 00:27:42,944
You're gonna
miss your flight.

629
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:44,246
I'm flying private, johnny.

630
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,881
They won't leave
till i get there.

631
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:47,482
Oh yeah, i forgot.

632
00:27:47,517 --> 00:27:49,518
- no word from e?
- or turtle.

00:27:52,155 --> 00:27:54,423
It's phil yagota.

635
00:27:54,457 --> 00:27:57,659
Hey, phil.
give me something
officially great.

636
00:27:57,694 --> 00:27:59,761
John, you blew us all
away at the audition.

637
00:27:59,796 --> 00:28:01,730
Yeah, i know.
you told me that yesterday.

638
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:03,699
<i>i wanted to tell
you again.</i>

639
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,500
So did i get it or not?

640
00:28:05,535 --> 00:28:07,402
In my mind you did.

641
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:10,338
<i>- whose other mind is there?
- the network's.</i>

642
00:28:10,373 --> 00:28:12,941
<i>- they didn't like me?
- they did like you.</i>

643
00:28:12,975 --> 00:28:16,011
- but?
- they think you're
too old, john.

644
00:28:16,045 --> 00:28:18,413
<i>- but i'm not.
- well, they think you are.</i>

645
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:20,982
I didn't shave yesterday.
i could cut my hair.

646
00:28:21,017 --> 00:28:22,751
They're going
younger, john.

647
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:27,956
I guess they've got to do
what they've got to do.

648
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,691
I've got to tell you,

649
00:28:29,726 --> 00:28:32,294
I thought you were gonna put
up a little more of a fight.

650
00:28:32,328 --> 00:28:34,596
I got no fight
left in me, phil.

651
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,399
<i>- i left it all in that room.
- i know you did, john.</i>

652
00:28:37,433 --> 00:28:40,268
- and so does the network.  -.

653
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:42,671
<i>in fact, they said
that they think</i>

654
00:28:42,705 --> 00:28:45,340
<i>that you are finally ready
to carry something.</i>

655
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47,175
Great.
let me know when
they got something.

656
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,311
They want to start developing
something for you now.

657
00:28:49,345 --> 00:28:52,047
<i>they want to give you
a holding deal and they
want to make sure</i>

658

<i>that nobody snags you up.</i>

659
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:57,919
Really?
i've never had a holding
deal before.

660
00:28:57,954 --> 00:28:59,688
Good times ahead, john.

Bye.

663

something for me to star in.


- johnny, that's amazing.
- yeah.

665

I brought some bags
just in case.

668
00:29:18,374 --> 00:29:20,242
A holding deal.

669
00:29:22,945 --> 00:29:24,946
It sucks the guys
are gonna miss this.

670
00:29:24,981 --> 00:29:27,683
It sucks for them.

671
00:29:32,955 --> 00:29:35,357
Thanks for flying.
bye bye.

672
00:29:35,391 --> 00:29:39,061
- thank you.
- any idea how quick
i can get to rome?

673
00:29:39,095 --> 00:29:41,463
You just flew in
from l.a.

674
00:29:41,497 --> 00:29:44,132
Oh yeah, i'm trying
to break the guinness record

675
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:46,735
For most miles in 24 hours.
what's it to you?

676
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:03,352
Wow, i didn't really
think you'd show.

677
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:06,254
- i didn't come for work.
- what did you come for?

678
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:07,656
I came to tell you
to go fuck yourself.

679
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,392
- watch it, lloyd.
- don't tell me what to do.

680
00:30:10,426 --> 00:30:12,894
And don't you dare
let yourself be convinced

681
00:30:12,929 --> 00:30:14,463
That i betrayed you.

682
00:30:14,497 --> 00:30:17,966
You abused me.
and you won't ever again.

683
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,335
But i will work myself
to the bone

684
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:23,372
So that someday i will be
in a position to abuse you.

685
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:26,241
You're not so smart.
how could you be

686
00:30:26,275 --> 00:30:28,310
If you actually believed
i would ever work for
you again?

687
00:30:28,344 --> 00:30:31,213
So you wouldn't work for me
if you were an agent?

688
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,782
Oh, you think
i'll fall for this?

689
00:30:33,816 --> 00:30:36,051
- and then you'll
laugh in my face.
- i'm serious, lloyd.

690
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:37,652
You just showed me balls
i didn't know you had.

691
00:30:37,687 --> 00:30:40,255
So that speech made you
believe i should be an agent?

692
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:42,391
I believed it
before you got here.

693
00:30:43,393 --> 00:30:45,560
Terrance apologized to me.

694
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:47,763
I...

695
00:30:48,998 --> 00:30:50,866
I'm sorry, lloyd.

696
00:30:51,968 --> 00:30:53,735
I still think
you're fucking with me.

697
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,504
Go check your office.

698
00:31:05,548 --> 00:31:09,051
It's supposed to say agent.

699
00:31:09,085 --> 00:31:11,453
( applauding )

700
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,395
Oh.

701
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,431
All right.

702
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:24,399
Get off.

703
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:30,272
Vince:

704
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:32,574

705
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,142

No no, pure coincidence.

00:31:44,754 --> 00:31:47,856
You guys know lebron.

719
00:32:07,443 --> 00:32:09,911
We're on a charitable
mission, john.

720
00:32:09,946 --> 00:32:12,914
The jet was donated by marquis

And you only gave 10 gs?

00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:25,093
That is a little
light, bro.

727
00:32:25,128 --> 00:32:26,461
I didn't know
what was appropriate.

728
00:32:26,496 --> 00:32:28,030
What did you give, lebron?
i'll match it.

729
00:32:28,064 --> 00:32:30,599

that you have money to give
to a foundation.

833
00:36:53,696 --> 00:36:55,664
But the fact is
that you do

834
00:36:55,698 --> 00:36:57,532
And you gave me your word
that you would.

835
00:36:57,567 --> 00:36:59,735
So give me the fucking
check, vince!

836
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:02,504
I can't believe i have
a fucking academy award

837
00:37:02,538 --> 00:37:04,206
And i am calling you back

838
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,175
Again and again and again,
you cocksucker!

839
00:37:08,611 --> 00:37:09,845
Send me the check!

840
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:12,180
( sobbing )

841
00:37:14,751 --> 00:37:16,618
Hey, vince.
it's matt.

842
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:18,720
I'm sorry.
i'm sorry, buddy.

843
00:37:18,755 --> 00:37:21,790
Um, that was really
out of line.

844
00:37:21,824 --> 00:37:24,559
And, um,
i didn't mean that.

845
00:37:24,594 --> 00:37:26,161
I'm just--
i'm just--

846
00:37:26,195 --> 00:37:28,563
I'm just
a little tired, man.

847
00:37:28,598 --> 00:37:30,866
And, uh, i'm sorry.

848
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:36,867
