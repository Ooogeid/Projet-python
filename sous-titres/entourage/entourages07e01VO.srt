1
00:00:03,155 --> 00:00:05,611
- Vinnie!
- Oh, look, it's my agent!

2
00:00:05,645 --> 00:00:08,391
Let's go reintroduce
you to the world.

3
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:13,123
I just think it's time for me
to make something of myself.

4
00:00:13,157 --> 00:00:14,599
Now you want to branch
out on your own?

5
00:00:14,634 --> 00:00:16,979
Happy Birthday!

6
00:00:18,587 --> 00:00:22,245
Have you ever considered making
a move to a bigger company?

7
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:24,356
Maybe we could do some
good for each other.

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,307
What's going on, ari?

9
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:28,885
They're gonna push
"Ferarri" 12 weeks.

10
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:31,097
So what am I gonna do for
the next three months?

11
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,603
Whatever you want, bro.

12
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:37,697
Yeah!

13
00:00:37,736 --> 00:00:39,012
- Can I take you to lunch?
- Yeah.

14
00:00:39,146 --> 00:00:40,885
All I can think about now
is how sweet it would be

15
00:00:40,919 --> 00:00:44,072
to ram Tony Soprano's
daughter from behind.

16
00:00:44,106 --> 00:00:46,516
- I'm gonna torture you.
- I am so screwed.

17
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,431
I want a promotion.
The time has come.

18
00:00:49,465 --> 00:00:51,274
I want to know if
this is gonna happen.

19
00:00:51,308 --> 00:00:54,088
I will not be strong-armed, Lloyd.

20
00:00:54,122 --> 00:00:56,531
- You just were, Ari Gold.
- What do you want?

21
00:00:56,565 --> 00:00:59,144
I want to know if you want
to make a deal. Yes or no?

22
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:02,191
This deal will make me the
head of the largest agency

23
00:01:02,225 --> 00:01:04,233
in the entire
entertainment business.

24
00:01:04,268 --> 00:01:06,242
Return to the king!

25
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:08,351
Ari! Jesus Christ!

26
00:01:08,385 --> 00:01:11,397
- Eric, stop!
- I swear to God I'll marry you.

27
00:01:11,432 --> 00:01:13,172
And this time it'll be forever.

28
00:01:13,207 --> 00:01:15,011
I made this decision to leave.

29
00:01:15,045 --> 00:01:17,119
They want to develop
something for me to star in.

30
00:01:17,153 --> 00:01:19,127
It's supposed to say "agent."

31
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:21,271
- Oh my God.
- Get off.

32
00:01:21,306 --> 00:01:23,043
Everybody wants to be
their own man, I guess.

33
00:01:23,077 --> 00:01:25,554
I believe!

35
00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:12,621
2:00 P.M., Burbank,

36
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:14,455
flight 230, American.

37
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,157
All right, good deal.
I'll have a girl there.

38
00:03:17,192 --> 00:03:21,160
You want Rachel? Yeah,
Rachel will be there, I guarantee it.

39
00:03:21,195 --> 00:03:23,762
Thanks. You are wanted.

40
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:25,397
- Why wouldn't I be?
- Go.

41
00:03:25,431 --> 00:03:27,432
Going.
- Abby, don't hate me.
You're going to Reseda.

42
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:29,934
- I love Reseda.
- Sarah, I need you on the phone.

43
00:03:29,968 --> 00:03:32,636
- What?! Where's the guy that does that?
- I fired him.

44
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,804
- He stole Vince's MTV award.
- Oh.

45
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,274
I'll replace him.
Just do it for me today? - Sure.

46
00:03:37,308 --> 00:03:39,376
- And where the hell is Alex?
- I don't know.

47
00:03:39,411 --> 00:03:41,879
- I'm here, I'm here!
- You're late.

48
00:03:41,913 --> 00:03:43,547
You're late again.

49
00:03:43,581 --> 00:03:46,983
L.A. is so confusing.

50
00:03:47,017 --> 00:03:48,817
You have a nav system.

51
00:03:48,852 --> 00:03:51,353
You rely too much on those, Turtle,
your brain turns to mush.

52
00:03:51,387 --> 00:03:52,853
You can't even find your way home.

53
00:03:52,888 --> 00:03:54,689
Looks like you can't
even find your shirt.

54
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:56,390
Turtle, it's okay.
She can wear mine.

55
00:03:56,424 --> 00:03:58,759
- Yeah?
- Yeah yeah.

56
00:03:58,793 --> 00:04:01,327
See? We're all good.
Just turn around.

57
00:04:02,562 --> 00:04:05,630
- And don't peek, Turtle.
- I'm not peeking.

58
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,766
- Okay, where am I going?
- L.A.X.

59
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,368
- But first you take me by Vince's set.
- Hey!

60
00:04:33,257 --> 00:04:34,957
All right, send him.

61
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:36,859
- Ed, go!
- Send him, send him.

62
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:38,994
Oh, is this where they
light him on fire?

63
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,628
- Yup.
- Nice.

64
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:51,771
Jesus.

65
00:04:51,805 --> 00:04:54,373
Don't worry, Turtle. I'm fine.

66
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:56,275
Cut!

67
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:59,744
- Uh...
- No resets!

68
00:05:01,614 --> 00:05:04,049
- What's his problem?
- Who knows?

69
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,584
- It looked good to me.
- All right, get her, boys.

70
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:08,853
Time to reload.

71
00:05:10,455 --> 00:05:13,190
- Hey.
- Yo yo! What's up?

72
00:05:13,224 --> 00:05:15,792
- How're you doing?
- Good. You wanted to see me?

73
00:05:15,826 --> 00:05:17,727
Yeah yeah, you remember
Chuckie the producer, right?

74
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:19,428
How are you doing? Good to see you.

75
00:05:19,462 --> 00:05:21,963
- Everything all right?
- Yeah yeah. Chuck?

76
00:05:21,998 --> 00:05:24,297
Vince, check yourself out.

77
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:28,067
- Oh wow, awesome.
- Right?

78
00:05:28,102 --> 00:05:30,403
Now watch this.

79
00:05:30,437 --> 00:05:32,838
- Oh, not so good.
- Terrible!

80
00:05:32,873 --> 00:05:36,374
- Guess we can't use that.
- No, we can't.

81
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:38,575
So do we get another double or...?

82
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,644
We can get another double,
but it'll still be shit.

83
00:05:40,678 --> 00:05:43,079
Not gonna look like you.

84
00:05:43,113 --> 00:05:44,813
So what, you wanna
light me on fire?

85
00:05:44,848 --> 00:05:48,016
- De Niro would do it.
- Look, this is an important movie for me.

86
00:05:48,051 --> 00:05:49,784
Yeah, for me also.

87
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:52,253
I don't want to bullshit the audience.
They're very smart.

88
00:05:52,288 --> 00:05:53,955
So you do want to light
me on fire?

89
00:05:53,989 --> 00:05:56,090
I don't want to light you on fire.
This scene's fine.

90
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:59,359
The wide shot looks great.
But we do have a big chase scene coming up.

91
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:02,861
And I want you to do the stunt.
Not the stuntman.

92
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,896
You... driving that car.

93
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,530
I want the audience
to look at you and go,

94
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:08,698
"God damn, that
motherfucker is a badass."

95
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:11,968
Because if they don't, because if it looks
fake, the movie's gonna suck, Vince.

96
00:06:12,002 --> 00:06:14,470
And you're gonna wind
up coming off like...

97
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:15,871
- Like a pussy.
- ...Like a pussy.

98
00:06:15,905 --> 00:06:18,206
You don't want to look like a pussy,
do you?

99
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:21,176
This is really good.

100
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,446
And everybody knows Johnny Drama
likes a good piece of meat.

101
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,948
Hey, don't get fresh.
Vince, you want a burger?

102
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:29,718
No, thank you. But, Turtle,
see if you can get E on the phone.

103
00:06:29,752 --> 00:06:31,519
Everything all right?

104
00:06:31,553 --> 00:06:33,221
Call me.

105
00:06:34,623 --> 00:06:36,456
Why didn't you just say no?

106
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,591
He was so passionate I
didn't know how to.

107
00:06:38,626 --> 00:06:41,227
He basically said the movie
will suck if I don't do it.

108
00:06:41,261 --> 00:06:43,829
That's ridiculous. I mean,
he should have brought that up

109
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:46,231
in preproduction, or when they
were making your deal.

110
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:49,000
For him to try and pressure you
into doing it now is just stupid.

111
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:52,937
You know, I did the fall down the
steps myself in "My so-called life."

112
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:56,339
- It was very liberating.
- And your brain hasn't worked right since.

113
00:06:56,373 --> 00:06:58,641
All right, E, I told Nick
I'd do it, so what now?

114
00:06:58,675 --> 00:07:00,309
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

115
00:07:00,343 --> 00:07:03,078
You better! Because if something
happens to Vince, we're all fucked.

116
00:07:03,112 --> 00:07:05,679
Actually only Drama is,
since he's the only one unemployed.

117
00:07:05,713 --> 00:07:09,315
My time is coming, driver.
In fact, I'm gonna see Yagoda today

118
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,651
to see what show the network's
ready to put me in.

119
00:07:11,685 --> 00:07:12,919
- You coming with?
- No.

120
00:07:12,953 --> 00:07:14,554
- Turtle.
- Why not?

121
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:15,955
Go with him. He's nervous.

122
00:07:15,989 --> 00:07:18,690
- Fine.
- Let me go too so
I can take care of this.

123
00:07:18,724 --> 00:07:20,391
Staff meeting is in 10 minutes.

124
00:07:20,425 --> 00:07:23,160
But, E, don't make me look
like I'm not a team player.

125
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:25,028
Don't worry, you won't.
I gotta go.

126
00:07:25,063 --> 00:07:27,898
Hey, Jennie, will you get
Ari for me, please?

127
00:07:27,932 --> 00:07:30,333
Jessica Simpson wants to
come in for some T.L.C.

128
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,068
Says she's not feeling the love.

129
00:07:32,102 --> 00:07:34,136
I think she's been down
since her dog got eaten.

130
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,304
That was like eight
months ago, right?

131
00:07:36,338 --> 00:07:38,505
- So show her the love.
- She wants you.

132
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:40,573
And so does Ryan Reynolds.
He says he thinks

133
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:42,974
you're not speaking to him because
you no longer show up for poker.

134
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:44,509
Okay, stop stop stop stop!

135
00:07:44,543 --> 00:07:47,512
Raj, go buy Jessica a new cockapoo.

136
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:51,083
And, Steph, tell Ryan the reason
I don't have time to play poker

137
00:07:51,117 --> 00:07:54,785
is because I spend my life
in here being bored to death

138
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,720
by you people, all right?

139
00:07:56,754 --> 00:08:00,191
This is now the biggest
agency in the world.

140
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:01,692
And I'm the head of it.

141
00:08:01,727 --> 00:08:03,827
Which makes me the bigger
agent in the world.

142
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:06,830
Now can anyone tell me why I chose

143
00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:09,665
to be the biggest
agent in the world?

144
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:13,569
It's so I can stop
being a fucking agent!

145
00:08:13,603 --> 00:08:15,603
So don't tell me to show the love.

146
00:08:15,638 --> 00:08:17,538
That's what I pay you people for.

147
00:08:17,572 --> 00:08:21,141
All right, so somebody
give me something big.

148
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:22,976
Anybody, please.

149
00:08:24,912 --> 00:08:27,046
Jesus Christ, you all suck.

150
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,348
If I didn't have a five-year lease
on this place, I'd shut it down

151
00:08:29,382 --> 00:08:31,817
and work out of a
cardboard box by myself.

152
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:34,853
I just read the N.F.L. Is getting
ready to resell the TV rights.

153
00:08:34,887 --> 00:08:37,387
- I think they could use you.
- Everyone could use me.

154
00:08:37,422 --> 00:08:38,956
Who are you? Jake Steinberg.

155
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,924
- I used to be on your desk.
- What happened?

156
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,759
- You threw me off.
- You're back on.

157
00:08:42,793 --> 00:08:44,794
- Throw the guy off who's on there now.
- Seriously?

158
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:46,528
- Mm-hmm. That's him.
- Ari!

159
00:08:46,563 --> 00:08:49,164
Eric Murphy's on the phone for you,
says it's urgent.

160
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:52,100
Somebody find out why we're
not selling the N.F.L. Rights.

161
00:08:52,134 --> 00:08:53,867
- They do it internally.
- They shouldn't,

162
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:56,170
so somebody get me a meeting.

163
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:58,905
E! Long time no hear.
You married yet?

164
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,039
October, Ari.
I assume you'll be there.

165
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,741
Listen, can I keep the little
groom from the top of the cake

166
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:06,176
just in case Sloan never lets
you out of the house again?

167
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,012
I can carry you around in my pocket
like I always dreamed of.

168
00:09:09,046 --> 00:09:11,381
I n shove it up your ass too.
I bet you'd love that.

169
00:09:11,415 --> 00:09:15,051
Feisty, E. Are your impending
nuptials making you tense?

170
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:17,152
No, not at all.
I actually feel great about it.

171
00:09:17,187 --> 00:09:18,920
That's natural. It'll pass.

172
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:21,590
Oh, come on, Ari. You're the
perfect picture of marital bliss.

173
00:09:21,624 --> 00:09:23,626
Like a hostage with a
machete to his neck,

174
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,694
you have to put on a
good face for the camera.

175
00:09:25,728 --> 00:09:27,528
- You're all talk.
- Yeah, maybe.

176
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:29,463
- What's up?
- Nick Cassavetes.

177
00:09:29,497 --> 00:09:31,065
What about him?

178
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:32,899
He wants Vince to do his own stunt.

179
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:35,269
He comes from a family
of method actors.

180
00:09:35,304 --> 00:09:38,005
They'll eat glass if it's
in the script. Tell him no.

181
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:40,273
He already said he would do it.

182
00:09:40,308 --> 00:09:42,275
He wants to do it?

183
00:09:43,544 --> 00:09:45,345
- He wants to be a team player.
- Jesus Christ.

184
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:48,914
- You represent the guy.
- I represent everyone now, Eric.

185
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:51,883
- Can you take care of this or not?
- I can do anything.

186
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:54,785
- Will you take care of this?
- Fine, all right.

187
00:09:56,788 --> 00:09:58,789
Try Nick Cassavetes.

188
00:09:58,823 --> 00:10:01,925
And did anyone get a meeting
with the goddamned N.F.L. yet?

189
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:06,328
- Hey, Phil, how are ya?
- I'm good.

190
00:10:06,363 --> 00:10:08,964
I'm good, John. How are you?

191
00:10:08,965 --> 00:10:10,765
A little anxious, to be honest,

192
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,767
since you wanted to
see me face to face.

193
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:15,736
Let's smoke up, John.

194
00:10:15,771 --> 00:10:19,106
- Smoke up? In here?
- Yeah yeah, eh, fuck it.

195
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,275
You're anxious. It's medicinal.

196
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:25,611
Smoke up and you'll
be anxious no more.

197
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,347
Okay.

198
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:30,682
So is this a celebratory
smoke, Phil?

199
00:10:30,716 --> 00:10:33,317
Afraid not, John.

200
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:36,219
Really?

201
00:10:38,922 --> 00:10:41,991
- Have a drink, John.
- Phil, I don't need a drink. I need a job.

202
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:44,893
- Drink drink, come on.
- You must have something for me.

203
00:10:44,927 --> 00:10:46,761
Afraid not.

204
00:10:46,795 --> 00:10:49,730
I don't understand. You have
three shows you're ready to make.

205
00:10:49,764 --> 00:10:51,731
I'm ready to produce them.

206
00:10:51,765 --> 00:10:53,599
The network's not
ready to make them.

207
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:55,635
None of them?

208
00:10:55,669 --> 00:10:58,737
Well, you know.
Sit down, sit down, come on.

209
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:01,073
But "The fall guy"
remake could be awesome!

210
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:03,508
We get Minka Kelly for the
Heather Thomas part...

211
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:05,143
It's not gonna happen.

212
00:11:08,413 --> 00:11:11,882
Jesus. So now what?

213
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,918
Well, you got eight
weeks left on your deal.

214
00:11:14,952 --> 00:11:17,987
We have to find something
before it runs out.

215
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:19,622
Find it where?

216
00:11:19,656 --> 00:11:21,957
I'm reading everything
that I can get my hands on.

217
00:11:21,992 --> 00:11:24,726
- But you gotta do your part.
- What can I do?

218
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:26,628
Talk to your agent.

219
00:11:26,662 --> 00:11:30,198
You put on a full-court
press and do it fast.

220
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:37,204
Alex, you go to the airport
at least twice a week.

221
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,039
I don't understand
how you can get lost.

222
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,142
There was traffic on the freeway so I got
off and tried to take the side streets.

223
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:45,111
And then this creepy looking
cholo started following me

224
00:11:45,146 --> 00:11:47,046
and he freaked me out
so I turned off.

225
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,281
Not every guy that drives
by you is following you.

226
00:11:49,315 --> 00:11:51,182
He didn't just drive by me,
Turtle.

227
00:11:51,216 --> 00:11:55,185
He rolled his window down and said,
"hey, baby, pull over. Let's fuck."

228
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,154
- Where are you now?
- I don't know.

229
00:11:58,188 --> 00:12:01,490
Oh... oh, wait! I see a sign.
I got it, I got it.

230
00:12:01,524 --> 00:12:03,291
- We're all good.
- Okay, good.

231
00:12:03,326 --> 00:12:06,394
Oh come on, let me in,
you cocksucker!

232
00:12:06,428 --> 00:12:09,363
- I gotta focus, Turtle. Bye.
- Bye.

233
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:13,366
- How'd it go?
- I got eight weeks till I'm homeless.

234
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,602
- What's your problem?
- Nothing.

235
00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:18,238
- That Alex driver again?
- Yeah.

236
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:20,539
- You gotta get rid of her.
- Yeah.

237
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,741
- Yeah what?
- Yeah, I gotta get rid of her.

238
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:25,442
This is your business, Turtle.
Stop thinking with your dick.

239
00:12:25,477 --> 00:12:27,610
Worry about your own business,
all right?

240
00:12:27,645 --> 00:12:30,947
Oh, I am. And wait till
you see how I handle it.

241
00:12:34,951 --> 00:12:37,552
You were supposed to meet
me at the school, Ari.

242
00:12:37,587 --> 00:12:40,655
I know, baby, but I got something
that I can't get out of.

243
00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:42,790
What am I gonna tell
your son's teacher?

244
00:12:42,825 --> 00:12:45,192
Tell her that I got something
that I can't get out of.

245
00:12:45,227 --> 00:12:48,662
I thought you said at this new agency
there'd always be someone to cover for you.

246
00:12:48,696 --> 00:12:50,464
Even with a million-man army

247
00:12:50,498 --> 00:12:52,632
sometimes you gotta do the
grunt work yourself.

248
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:55,635
Saddam Hussein had to hang a
few without assistance, no?

249
00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:57,569
I like it when we do
these things together.

250
00:12:57,604 --> 00:12:59,838
Tell the school that
when they schedule

251
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:02,274
a parent-teacher conference for 2:
30 on a weekday

252
00:13:02,308 --> 00:13:05,110
that's just their way of saying "
we don't care about daddy."

253
00:13:05,144 --> 00:13:07,912
If I get her to change it to tomorrow,
will you be there?

254
00:13:07,946 --> 00:13:09,878
With bells on. Kisses, baby.

255
00:13:09,912 --> 00:13:11,646
Goodbye.

256
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,616
You gotta hit this thing somewhere
between a 30° and a 50° angle.

257
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,285
Anything more, anything
less and you got problems.

258
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,420
What kind of problems?

259
00:13:20,454 --> 00:13:23,122
Big problems, you understand?

260
00:13:24,023 --> 00:13:25,356
- Ari!
- Vinnie!

261
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,458
- Would you excuse me for a moment?
- Yeah yeah.

262
00:13:27,493 --> 00:13:30,361
Ari, I'm so happy to see you.
They got me looking at models over here.

263
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:33,830
Not to worry. I'm going to take care of
what your little man couldn't, all right?

264
00:13:33,864 --> 00:13:35,998
- This gonna be a huge problem?
- No, not at all.

265
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:38,133
Listen, don't worry. Where's Nick?

266
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:40,035
- He's over by his trailer.
- All right.

267
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,836
Ari, don't make me look bad.

268
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:44,071
Have I ever?

269
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:49,376
- I bet 2,000.
- Fuck you. I'm all in.

270
00:13:55,248 --> 00:13:57,516
Oh God. Deal me out.

271
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,384
- Hello, Ari.
- What, no call back?

272
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:02,487
I know, I know. Look,
Vince wants to do the stunt.

273
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:03,888
I don't want him to.

274
00:14:03,923 --> 00:14:06,291
Well, you're my agent also
and that's what I want.

275
00:14:06,325 --> 00:14:07,959
Nick, it's not gonna happen.
I'm shutting it down.

276
00:14:07,993 --> 00:14:09,427
- You are?
- That's right.

277
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:11,395
- And how are you doing that?
- By telling you not to do it.

278
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:14,598
You'd better be careful, Ari.
I'm not fucking Chad McQueen.

279
00:14:14,632 --> 00:14:17,734
I can't believe that the studio's
not concerned about this thing.

280
00:14:17,768 --> 00:14:20,169
How are they even insuring it?

281
00:14:20,203 --> 00:14:23,438
They don't know?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

282
00:14:23,472 --> 00:14:25,373
Listen, Ari, you tell the studio

283
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,975
and I'll break your fucking head.
How about that?

284
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:30,010
- Have a nice day.
- All right.

285
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,048
I mean it, Ari.

286
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,350
- How is everything?
- Excellent.

287
00:14:36,384 --> 00:14:38,585
- Great as always, Stefan.
- Thank you.

288
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:40,587
I don't want to go back to work.

289
00:14:40,621 --> 00:14:43,855
Can't we just fantasize
about Greece over dessert?

290
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,591
- I'd love to, but I have to go back to work.
- I know you do.

291
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,227
Thanks for taking the time
out of your busy day for me.

292
00:14:49,261 --> 00:14:51,896
Every chance I get.

293
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:53,998
It's Ari. Hello.

294
00:14:54,032 --> 00:14:56,133
Call the studio.
Tell them that you're concerned

295
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:58,335
that Nick will kill your client.
All will be well.

296
00:14:58,369 --> 00:15:01,337
But make sure that it doesn't
come from me or I will kill you.

297
00:15:01,372 --> 00:15:03,372
You know, Ari, for the most
powerful agent in the world,

298
00:15:03,406 --> 00:15:05,207
sometimes you're a real pussy.

299
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:07,208
I will read every single script

300
00:15:07,243 --> 00:15:09,909
that comes through this door,
Johnny Drama. That is a promise!

301
00:15:09,944 --> 00:15:12,111
Hundreds of scripts must
come through here every day.

302
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:15,013
I'm like Evelyn Wood.
I just speed-read right through them.

303
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,515
Yet we haven't found one
that the studio will make.

304
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,050
You're not blaming that on me?

305
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,918
This is my livelihood,
Lloyd, and my dream.

306
00:15:21,953 --> 00:15:23,686
You don't think I know that?

307
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:25,988
You're just one man, Lloyd.

308
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:28,257
- I need a team.
- A team?

309
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,726
Team Drama.

310
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,862
It's Alex again.
I'm sorry, I've got to take this.

311
00:15:33,896 --> 00:15:36,697
- What happened now?
- Johnny.

312
00:15:36,732 --> 00:15:38,966
What's really going on here?

313
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,301
I got eight weeks to get a show,
so I want a team assigned to me,

314
00:15:42,336 --> 00:15:45,537
a team whose sole purpose is to
focus on finding me this show.

315
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:47,039
I don't have the manpower for that.

316
00:15:47,073 --> 00:15:49,075
I thought this was the
biggest agency in the world.

317
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:50,777
I'm not authorized to provide that.

318
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:53,045
Then I need to speak
to the man that is.

319
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,714
Alex lost the car. I gotta go to the
airport. You wanna give me a ride?

320
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:58,817
- No, I'm meeting Ari.
- Later.

321
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:00,952
- But get rid of her!
- Johnny!

322
00:16:00,986 --> 00:16:03,888
- Ari's not here.
- Who's that then?

323
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,956
Hey, Ari, could I have a word?

324
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:07,724
- With who?
- With you.

325
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,526
Uh, you have an Agent.

326
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,796
- He's not delivering me what I need.
- No? What do you need?

327
00:16:12,831 --> 00:16:14,831
He wants a team, Ari.

328
00:16:14,866 --> 00:16:16,133
- You want a team?
- Yeah.

329
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:18,601
You mean like how
Brad Pitt has a team?

330
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:20,636
Well, yeah. If I get the
right show on the air,

331
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,738
I can be worth as
much as Brad Pitt.

332
00:16:22,772 --> 00:16:24,306
Look at Kiefer.

333
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,242
Ari, you know how hard I
worked to get to this point

334
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,478
and I'm right there.
I just need you to care. Please.

335
00:16:29,512 --> 00:16:32,513
I do care, Drama, that's why
I'm still standing here.

336
00:16:32,548 --> 00:16:34,582
- You do not need a team.
- A greenlit show

337
00:16:34,616 --> 00:16:36,717
with me as the lead,
it'll change my life.

338
00:16:36,751 --> 00:16:39,019
Why doesn't he have a
greenlit show, Lloyd?

339
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:40,987
The network hasn't found
a script they like yet.

340
00:16:41,021 --> 00:16:43,722
They haven't found a script they like or
they haven't found a script they like for him?

341
00:16:43,757 --> 00:16:45,924
- Well...
- What does that mean?

342
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,228
It means they're still making shows, right?
They're not out of business.

343
00:16:51,263 --> 00:16:54,331
- So are you giving it to him straight?
- Giving me what straight?

344
00:16:57,501 --> 00:16:59,635
Maybe they don't want to
make a show with you, Drama.

345
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:01,369
They gave me a holding deal.

346
00:17:01,404 --> 00:17:04,872
The guy who grills my hot dog at
Carney's had a holding deal in 1978.

347
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:07,643
Phil says we just need a script.
You think he's lying?

348
00:17:07,677 --> 00:17:10,446
I don't know who Phil is,
but I think he might be, yeah.

349
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:15,283
- Lloyd, what's the truth?
- Don't go crazy, Johnny.

350
00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:18,017
- What?
- They're making "The fall guy."

351
00:17:19,553 --> 00:17:22,355
You're kidding me. Phil told me
they weren't making that show.

352
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,391
I'm so sorry, Drama, but they are.

353
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:27,193
- Just maybe not with you.
- With who then?

354
00:17:27,228 --> 00:17:29,395
Dean Cain.

355
00:17:30,297 --> 00:17:32,865
Dean Cain, Jesus Christ.

356
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,202
Look, just let the deal run out,
all right? Something will come along.

357
00:17:36,236 --> 00:17:39,806
Don't worry out it. - I want my own show,
Ari. They promised me that.

358
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,075
I don't think even I can
make that happen, Drama.

359
00:17:44,311 --> 00:17:46,279
I'm sorry.

360
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:53,283
Wow. I mean, you really
think Ari told the studio?

361
00:17:53,317 --> 00:17:57,052
- Fucking piece of shit.
- I just can't believe he'd go against both of us.

362
00:17:57,087 --> 00:17:59,821
What a shock, huh? It looks good,
Mikey. Thank you.

363
00:17:59,856 --> 00:18:02,590
Well, I guess we'll go
back to using a double.

364
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,560
Vince, you're a big boy.
You want to do the stunt, you do it.

365
00:18:05,594 --> 00:18:07,428
- You got all the power.
- I don't know.

366
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:10,097
Come on, the studio wants you
for three movies right now.

367
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:12,533
You do what you want.
You just gotta put your foot down.

368
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:15,870
- Yeah, except...
- When Sean Penn wanted to do
"She's so lovely" with me,

369
00:18:15,904 --> 00:18:18,405
he wanted to jump through a
plate-glass fucking window.

370
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,941
Not with fucking fake glass.
Real fucking glass.

371
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,743
You think the studio
wanted him to do it?

372
00:18:22,777 --> 00:18:25,178
You think the insurance
companies weren't going crazy?

373
00:18:25,213 --> 00:18:27,348
Sean basically had to quit the
film to get what he wanted.

374
00:18:27,382 --> 00:18:29,216
- And you know what?
- He did it?

375
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,451
He did it. Goddamn right.

376
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,620
Sean's no bitch.

377
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:37,991
- Does anything look vaguely familiar?
- Mmm, not really.

378
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:40,559
- How far did you walk to get to the stairs?
- I took the elevator.

379
00:18:40,593 --> 00:18:42,426
- How many floors down?
- I don't remember!

380
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,660
- Stop grilling me.
- Turtle, give her a break.

381
00:18:44,694 --> 00:18:46,860
I don't understand how
anyone could lose a car.

382
00:18:46,895 --> 00:18:49,394
I'm sorry, Turtle.
It's not like I'm an idiot.

383
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,430
- I just have a ton on my mind.
- Turtle: Don't cry.

384
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,565
- Well, you're yelling at me.
- I'm not yelling.

385
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,300
Stop stop stop, there it is.
There it is.

386
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:58,934
- All right, you're going to Santa Monica, okay?
- Yes, sir.

387
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:06,372
- I'm really sorry.
- For the third time today, Alex.

388
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:09,743
It's just my parents are
getting divorced, okay?

389
00:19:09,777 --> 00:19:12,779
Oh, I'm really sorry.

390
00:19:12,813 --> 00:19:15,181
No, no, I'm sorry.

391
00:19:15,215 --> 00:19:18,383
It's not an excuse,
but I've been distracted.

392
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:20,551
And I haven't told anyone till you,

393
00:19:20,585 --> 00:19:23,352
because honestly,
I still can't even believe it.

394
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:26,188
I mean, I know divorce
is common and all,

395
00:19:26,222 --> 00:19:28,522
but my father was like the
perfect dad, you know?

396
00:19:28,557 --> 00:19:30,591
Only it turns out that he wasn't.

397
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:31,725
Hey, come on, don't cry.

398
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,827
Come on, don't cry. Come here.

399
00:19:34,729 --> 00:19:36,729
It's gonna be okay.

400
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:41,700
All right?

401
00:19:44,904 --> 00:19:46,838
- What the hell are you doing?
- Nothing.

402
00:19:46,873 --> 00:19:49,740
I don't know. I just
thought we had a moment.

403
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:51,608
What moment? I tell you my parents

404
00:19:51,642 --> 00:19:53,610
are getting divorced
and you try to kiss me.

405
00:19:53,644 --> 00:19:56,979
Yes, I'm really sorry.
I totally misread the situation.

406
00:19:57,013 --> 00:19:59,681
- I thought we had a vibe.
- Let's just stop.

407
00:19:59,716 --> 00:20:01,750
Let's just get out of here.

408
00:20:10,324 --> 00:20:13,692
I, um, I think I shouldn't
work for you anymore.

409
00:20:13,727 --> 00:20:16,061
Come on, Alex,
don't quit because of me.

410
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:18,863
It's a really good job and
you're really good at it.

411
00:20:18,898 --> 00:20:20,965
I'm not really.

412
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,868
I know you wish you could
have fired me lots of times.

413
00:20:23,902 --> 00:20:25,702
But now I know why you didn't.

414
00:20:25,736 --> 00:20:27,970
- It's not like that.
- Oh no?

415
00:20:28,005 --> 00:20:30,039
What is it like?

416
00:20:35,211 --> 00:20:37,312
Take it easy, John.

417
00:20:37,346 --> 00:20:39,447
Why didn't you just tell me they
didn't want to make a show with me?

418
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:42,283
- Because they do want to make a show with you.
- I mean, Jesus Christ.

419
00:20:42,317 --> 00:20:44,218
They gave me a deal, a couple bucks

420
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:45,919
to keep me off the
market and then nothing.

421
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,887
This is all because they're
making "The fall guy"?

422
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:50,122
- You told me they weren't making it.
- No, I did not.

423
00:20:50,156 --> 00:20:52,824
- I said it wasn't happening with you.
- Why not?

424
00:20:52,858 --> 00:20:54,625
They want someone...

425
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,360
Prettier.

426
00:20:56,394 --> 00:20:58,829
Dean Cain is prettier than me?

427
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:02,732
Hello?

428
00:21:02,766 --> 00:21:04,901
You're specific, John,
and that's a good thing.

429
00:21:04,935 --> 00:21:07,236
It means when we find the right thing,
it'll be special.

430
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,838
- And it will pop.
- My team doesn't think so.

431
00:21:09,872 --> 00:21:12,607
My team doesn't think the network's
ever going to make a show with me.

432
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:16,043
They're fucking agents,
John! They don't believe in extra work.

433
00:21:16,078 --> 00:21:20,080
You just keep pushing.
You just keep believing in yourself.

434
00:21:20,115 --> 00:21:21,748
I do.

435
00:21:25,152 --> 00:21:26,752
Fucking Ari.

436
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:28,721
It doesn't matter if Sean Penn
does his own stunts, Vince.

437
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:30,189
It doesn't mean that you should.

438
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:31,757
Tom Cruise in "Knight
and day" also.

439
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,925
I've wasted too much of
my day on this already.

440
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,727
First you want out,
then you want in.

441
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,495
Which is it? I got dinner with the wife.
She's gonna cut my balls off.

442
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:40,596
I hate Ari, bro!

443
00:21:43,465 --> 00:21:45,065
Oh hey, Ari.

444
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,967
Hey, dickhead. What's the beef?

445
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:48,768
No beef.

446
00:21:48,802 --> 00:21:51,973
I just wish you would put as much effort
into my career as you do your own.

447
00:21:52,007 --> 00:21:53,975
That sounds reasonable.

448
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:55,576
- Be nice, Ari.
- I will be.

449
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,510
But right now I'm
worried about you.

450
00:21:57,545 --> 00:21:59,278
Why, what's wrong with Vince?
You all right?

451
00:21:59,312 --> 00:22:01,947
- He's thinking about doing the stunt.
- Come on.

452
00:22:01,981 --> 00:22:05,216
- What?!
- Nothing. I just don't see it.

453
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,383
You know Will Smith did all
his own stunts on "Hancock"?

454
00:22:07,418 --> 00:22:09,385
Will's an athlete, bro.
I bowled with him.

455
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:12,120
Jesus Christ, what are we doing?
I got dinner.

456
00:22:12,154 --> 00:22:13,221
- Yo.
- Yo.

457
00:22:13,255 --> 00:22:14,855
Yo, did you fire that broad yet?

458
00:22:14,889 --> 00:22:17,556
- No, actually she quit.
- Really?

459
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,424
Impressive.
How'd you pull that off?

460
00:22:19,459 --> 00:22:22,226
- It doesn't matter. I don't want to talk about it.
- Awww, he's sad.

461
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,095
- He totally likes her.
- Who gives a shit?

462
00:22:25,129 --> 00:22:27,530
- Vinnie, what are we doing?
- Turtle,

463
00:22:27,564 --> 00:22:29,898
I think I'm going to
do the stunt myself.

464
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:33,466
- Come on.
- Wow.

465
00:22:33,501 --> 00:22:35,668
You all think I'm such a pussy.

466
00:22:35,703 --> 00:22:40,039
All right, I'm gonna call the
studio and tell them I'm doing it.

467
00:22:40,074 --> 00:22:42,176
Vince, you're gonna
do the stunt for what?

468
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,612
So these guys don't
think you're a pussy?

469
00:22:43,647 --> 00:22:45,816
No, I'm gonna do it so I
stop feeling like one.

470
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,858
- Full loads?
- Yeah.

471
00:22:54,893 --> 00:22:56,828
Good. Good good.

472
00:22:56,862 --> 00:23:00,700
This is not a rehearsal!
We got one shot at this.

473
00:23:00,735 --> 00:23:04,003
- I'm sorry, baby.
- I changed this to today for you.

474
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:05,672
- I'm gonna make it up to you.
- How?!

475
00:23:05,706 --> 00:23:07,441
I'm gonna take you away
for the weekend.

476
00:23:07,475 --> 00:23:09,408
I'll get a plane.
We'll go to Cabo.

477
00:23:09,443 --> 00:23:12,410
We'll stay at Meldman's. I'm gonna
get you a nice lobster from Edith's.

478
00:23:12,444 --> 00:23:14,145
- Really?
- No, not really.

479
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:17,080
I got the company retreat this weekend.
I totally forgot.

480
00:23:17,114 --> 00:23:19,182
Hello? Hello?

481
00:23:19,216 --> 00:23:21,618
- You all right?
- My hand's shaking a little,

482
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:24,254
but I'll be okay. What's the
worst that could happen?

483
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:26,456
Vic Morrow got his head
chopped off by a helicopter.

484
00:23:26,491 --> 00:23:28,692
- Brandon Lee got shot with squibs.
- E: Idiots.

485
00:23:28,726 --> 00:23:30,460
- Good talk.
- You nervous?

486
00:23:30,495 --> 00:23:31,728
No.

487
00:23:31,763 --> 00:23:33,297
Well, a little.

488
00:23:33,331 --> 00:23:35,866
All right. I'm operating the camera,
so we're in this together.

489
00:23:35,901 --> 00:23:38,836
- What do you mean?
- I'm gonna be in there with you, brother.

490
00:23:39,771 --> 00:23:41,872
Not too late to call it off.

491
00:23:41,906 --> 00:23:44,373
Are you kidding me?
That'd be humiliating.

492
00:23:44,408 --> 00:23:47,509
The guy's got "Extra" and "Entertainment
tonight" here just to see this.

493
00:23:47,543 --> 00:23:49,677
- And he's doing the stunt with me.
- Relly?

494
00:23:49,711 --> 00:23:51,912
Yeah, it'll be fine.

495
00:23:53,581 --> 00:23:55,782
"E.T."'s here?

496
00:23:55,816 --> 00:23:57,951
Hey, scumbag,
you see the trades today?

497
00:23:57,985 --> 00:24:00,386
- Not yet.
- Check toward the back.

498
00:24:00,421 --> 00:24:02,922
You guys should check it out.
It concerns you too.

499
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,994
Where'd you get that?

500
00:24:10,028 --> 00:24:11,962
Google images.
Payback's a bitch, Ari.

501
00:24:11,997 --> 00:24:14,899
Back when you were on the sauce,
you would have tried to fuck it!

502
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:17,201
- You ready?
- Yeah, we're ready.

503
00:24:17,235 --> 00:24:19,036
- What do we got?
- Vehicle's ready.

504
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,637
Vincent's got it down cold.

505
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:23,540
All we gotta do is get you in,
get a camera on you,

506
00:24:23,574 --> 00:24:25,809
roll it, take a shot at it.

507
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:28,245
- Piece of cake, right?
- Yep.

508
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:31,748
Let us pray.

509
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,950
Remember, Vince, the worst
thing you could do is hesitate.

510
00:24:36,984 --> 00:24:39,548
- Get on this bad boy and go.
- Got it.

511
00:24:39,582 --> 00:24:42,149
The accelerator is your friend.
Trust your steering.

512
00:24:42,183 --> 00:24:44,917
- As soon as you land the jump...
- Cut to the right and brake.

513
00:24:44,952 --> 00:24:47,753
That's right. I'll be
communicating with you by walkie.

514
00:24:47,788 --> 00:24:49,621
All right.

515
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:51,723
- I'm ready.
- Nick, you okay?

516
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:53,258
- Let's do it.
- Ready!

517
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,262
- Do this!
- Okay, action!

518
00:24:57,296 --> 00:25:00,198
Camera.

519
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,739
It won't brake. It won't brake!

520
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:10,207
Oh shit!

521
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:12,575
Get that fire out!

522
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,677
Fire team 2, go go go!

523
00:25:14,712 --> 00:25:17,045
Hey, guys, get in there!

524
00:25:20,581 --> 00:25:23,048
Hold on. Just let
them put out the fire.

525
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:25,818
Just hold on, guys. Just wait a second.
Let them do their jobs.

526
00:25:25,852 --> 00:25:28,253
Okay okay.

527
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:35,226
- All right, he's out.
- Oh God.

528
00:25:36,894 --> 00:25:38,762
- You okay, bro?
- Yeah.

529
00:25:38,796 --> 00:25:40,963
I don't know, I... I think so.

530
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,698
- Does anything hurt?
- No.

531
00:25:42,733 --> 00:25:44,667
I saw my life flash before my eyes.

532
00:25:44,702 --> 00:25:47,270
I didn't. I just saw ma.
She was really pissed.

533
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:49,805
- You all right...
- Guys!

534
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,507
- I think I'm okay.
- You could have internal bleeding.

535
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:54,209
He actually looks okay.
His vitals are fine.

536
00:25:54,243 --> 00:25:56,911
I'm actually okay too,
if anybody gives a shit.

537
00:25:56,945 --> 00:25:59,147
- I don't give a shit.
- Nick!

538
00:25:59,181 --> 00:26:01,315
I'm sorry. I screwed it up.

539
00:26:01,349 --> 00:26:03,417
You all right?

540
00:26:03,451 --> 00:26:05,819
I gotta tell you,
that shit looked sick.

541
00:26:06,854 --> 00:26:08,654
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

542
00:26:12,525 --> 00:26:15,126
'Cause if you're not sure,
I'm ready to go again.

543
00:26:16,228 --> 00:26:17,995
Seriously.

544
00:26:17,996 --> 00:26:22,996

545
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:26,669
-  Prepared for liftoff.
