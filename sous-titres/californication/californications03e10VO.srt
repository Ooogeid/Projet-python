<i>Previously on </i>Californication...

2
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:03,237
Not Hank's fault?

3
00:00:03,362 --> 00:00:05,880
- Excuse me. What does that mean?
- It's not my fault.

4
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:08,841
- You didn't tell her?
- Tell me what?

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,093
Becca's father and I
had a slight indiscretion.

6
00:00:11,408 --> 00:00:12,769
She's kidding, right?

7
00:00:12,894 --> 00:00:15,723
I don't want to hear about
Felicia and her mid-life crisis.

8
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,900
Fuck me, bone me, stuff me.
Take your pick.

9
00:00:19,557 --> 00:00:21,613
Wait, who else has he been fucking?

10
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,398
You?
Oh, gross.

11
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,734
Can't believe
you slept with all of them.

12
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:29,052
You're a goddamn girl-whisperer.

13
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,988
- Julian's a writer too.
- Really.

14
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,783
He wrote the <i>Artist Within.</i>
Fucking genius.

15
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,911
Why are you asking me to procure
you drugs like I'm your assistant?

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,288
I'm dating my dream crush.

17
00:00:39,858 --> 00:00:41,332
Hitting my peak sexually.

18
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,501
Just give me my blow,
and let's just call it a day.

19
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,586
No fucking way, Rick Springfield.

20
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,755
You just don't want me
to be happy, Charlie.

21
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,679
- You're going to get your ass fired?
- Not if I fire you first.

22
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,515
You want to go back to
slinging beamers in the valley?

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,351
Maybe I got carried away.

24
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:39,932
What's the dilly, yo?

25
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:42,437
Where are you fine young
wenches off to this evening?

26
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:43,562
Dinner.

27
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:45,079
I could eat.

28
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:48,294
Give me a second? I want to change
my shirt. These pits are barking.

29
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:51,255
No, actually, that's pretty good.
Salty.

30
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,489
Yeah, you girls want some of this?
Check it out? Keeps you regular.

31
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,407
All right, what are we thinking?

32
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,993
We're thinking
that you weren't exactly invited.

33
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,543
- That shit is cold.
- Yeah, you know Marcy's in a funk

34
00:02:04,668 --> 00:02:07,258
about the whole Rick
Springfield of it all. So...

35
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,562
We were going to take her out,

36
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:11,888
show her a good time.
Lady stuff.

37
00:02:12,013 --> 00:02:13,966
- I like the lady stuff.
- I know you do.

38
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:18,968
I was kind of looking forward to this
as a little family togetherness time.

39
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,065
Maybe next time.

40
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,190
'cause I thought
it might be good foreplay.

41
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,901
Family togetherness
equals foreplay how exactly?

42
00:02:28,026 --> 00:02:31,811
Well, it's been quite some time since
we've lain together as man and woman.

43
00:02:31,936 --> 00:02:34,653
- It's going to be some time, Hank.
- Really? Can you...

44
00:02:35,258 --> 00:02:37,823
How many...
Days, weeks, months?

45
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:42,274
When I close my eyes,
and I don't see you inside

46
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:45,833
- that annoying little simp of a woman.
- Oh, that's gross.

47
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,334
Then maybe I'll be good to go.
I mean, roughly speaking.

48
00:02:48,647 --> 00:02:51,128
- Why you got to be like that?
- Was it good, Hank? The sex?

49
00:02:51,423 --> 00:02:53,631
- Ah, come on.
- Did she rock your world?

50
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:57,843
- Did she fuck your brains out?
- Oh, stop, I was performing a service.

51
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,468
When a plumber works on pipes,
he doesn't think about their quality.

52
00:03:01,593 --> 00:03:04,578
He just fixes the shit out of them,
and then he goes the fuck home.

53
00:03:04,703 --> 00:03:06,249
And drinks to forget.

54
00:03:07,658 --> 00:03:10,223
You guys have a lovely evening.
Say hi to the Marce for me.

55
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:11,798
Tell her to keep her chin up.

56
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:13,623
I'll be fine here alone.

57
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:16,737
Eating a pb&j under a bare bulb.

Ground control to major dong.

62
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:13,068
Not a good time, Hank.

63
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,526
I'm getting a serious
relocation vibe, here.

64
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:17,529
You moving north of Wilshire?

65
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:20,178
I got the ax, Hank.
Shit-canned.

66
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:23,637
Charlie Runkle is once again
an agent without an agency.

67
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:26,640
- Rick Springfield ankled?
- That's right.

68
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,411
That he-man, woman-hating
salad-tosser is now in play.

69
00:04:30,711 --> 00:04:32,312
Buck up, Chuck.
You've still got me.

70
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:34,815
I'm bound to put pen to paper
one of these days. Hey, fuck you.

71
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,708
Here are the rest of them.

72
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:42,837
I trust you will be discreet, especially
with the ones with my legs akimbo.

73
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,666
Sure thing, Sue.

74
00:04:45,429 --> 00:04:47,103
The writer who doesn't write.

75
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:49,655
I take it you're off
with Jerry Maguire, here.

76
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,148
Oh, undoubtedly.
Homies before hoes you know?

77
00:04:52,273 --> 00:04:54,209
Ah, good.
Well, it saved me a phone call.

78
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,340
There's no heat on you. I mean,
you're as cold as a witch's cunny.

79
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,230
The lady's really got it
in for me this evening.

80
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,640
- It's just business. You understand.
- I get it.

81
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:07,633
- Nothing personal.
- Nope.

82
00:05:07,758 --> 00:05:08,858
Now, Runkle.

83
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:11,629
Just because we no longer have
a professional relationship

84
00:05:11,754 --> 00:05:13,838
does not mean that you cannot

85
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,816
wine me, dine me,

86
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,190
and stand-up 69 me
once in a while, huh?

87
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:20,809
Dear god.

88
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,788
Well, she's got a point.

89
00:05:22,913 --> 00:05:26,049
There's no reason you should let
a professional misstep come between you

90
00:05:26,174 --> 00:05:27,553
and a quality 69.

91
00:05:27,678 --> 00:05:31,997
So you fire me, but you still want
me around as some sort of boy toy?

92
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:33,916
How's sundays for you?

93
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:36,916
Charlie Runkle is not a doormat.

94
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:41,590
He's not some puppy that comes trotting
back after being kicked to the curb.

95
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,368
- You go, girl.
- Suit yourself, stallion.

96
00:05:44,826 --> 00:05:48,769
You know, we could have been
lifelong fuck buddies, Runkle.

97
00:05:49,502 --> 00:05:51,270
Leave your keys with Rhonda.

98
00:05:51,395 --> 00:05:53,795
Collini, out.

99
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:57,106
She's a sweet woman.

100
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,238
Salt of the earth, really.
I'm going to miss her.

101
00:05:59,363 --> 00:06:00,818
- Really?
- Not really.

102
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:03,202
Want to get some gin and juice?

103
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,465
Think I'm going to take me
one of these.

104
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,590
Bad boy.

105
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,594
Two hamsters in a fucking cage,
going round and round.

106
00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:20,419
When will we ever learn?

107
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:24,578
I'm still working off last year's sins.
You've got fresh blood on your hands.

108
00:06:24,703 --> 00:06:26,927
I didn't commit any crimes, though.
That's the thing.

109
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,930
Karen was clear across the country.
Thought we had an understanding. We did.

110
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,480
She did some things.

111
00:06:33,177 --> 00:06:34,727
Clearly I did some things.

112
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:37,730
But we're being very adult
and European about it.

113
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:42,526
No matter what they say, bitches don't
like it when you fuck other bitches.

114
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:46,568
Word. And they don't like it
when you call them bitches, either.

115
00:06:46,693 --> 00:06:49,173
FYI for you, Charlie Runkle.

116
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:51,670
So you think
we'll ever get it right?

117
00:06:52,803 --> 00:06:54,351
That remains to be seen.

118
00:06:54,476 --> 00:06:57,039
I think that ultimately they're
going to have to raise the white flag

119
00:06:57,164 --> 00:07:00,208
and just accept us for the emotional
retards that we are, don't you think?

120
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,670
One would think.

121
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,988
Just hope my wiener still works.

122
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,400
You'll be punishing that thing
with gnarled, arthritic hands.

123
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:08,825
Don't you worry.

124
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:11,680
I still love her, though. You know?

125
00:07:11,977 --> 00:07:14,227
My sweet little piece of Marcipan.

126
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,958
Those boobies?

127
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,357
- Her teeny, tiny bajinie.
- That's enough.

128
00:07:18,482 --> 00:07:21,690
After all these years, she still gets
this white man harder than igneous rock.

129
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,817
Settle down, white man.
Take it to the restroom.

130
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,139
Don't you have
those moments sometimes?

131
00:07:26,264 --> 00:07:28,944
You know, when you just...
You think to yourself, "God...

132
00:07:29,478 --> 00:07:32,370
"I love this woman,
and I always will."

133
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,612
There was this one time...

134
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:37,039
I fell asleep in the Porsche
outside of Bill's house.

135
00:07:37,287 --> 00:07:38,916
- Just once?
- Becca found me.

136
00:07:40,141 --> 00:07:44,317
It was, like, two or three years ago.
Karen invited me in, made me breakfast.

137
00:07:44,442 --> 00:07:47,758
Now, I know that Becca, I'm sure,
strong-armed her into inviting me in.

138
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:51,300
But, that's not the point. She made
me breakfast, and she didn't have to.

139
00:07:51,425 --> 00:07:54,097
You know, she made me
this omelet that was delicious.

140
00:07:54,222 --> 00:07:57,522
Perfect breakfast. You know why?
Because she made it for me.

141
00:07:58,217 --> 00:08:01,715
Then she told me to grow the fuck up and
get on with my life. That didn't matter.

142
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,978
Because it was one of those
moments where I decided...

143
00:08:05,103 --> 00:08:07,903
I resolved that I was
going to keep on fighting.

144
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:12,598
You know, I've lost many battles,
but I've never lost sight of the war.

145
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,819
No retreat, baby.

146
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:16,094
No surrender.

147
00:08:18,156 --> 00:08:20,541
Jesus Christ, Runkle,
are you weeping again?

148
00:08:20,907 --> 00:08:23,455
Well, it was sweet.
You... You moved me.

149
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,580
Jesus.

150
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:26,510
Get a load of this asshole.

151
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:29,091
No shit, brosephina,
you spilled on my buddy here.

152
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:31,135
I did, sorry.

153
00:08:32,955 --> 00:08:34,471
- Excuse me.
- Just let it go.

154
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,390
Excuse me.
I don't mean to be a nudge.

155
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,118
Let it go, It's not worth...

156
00:08:38,243 --> 00:08:39,954
Just now,
when you said you were sorry,

157
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:42,085
it didn't really sound like
you were sincere to me.

158
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,023
It was, like, "eh, I'm sorry."
Perfunctory.

159
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,650
You understand that word?

160
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:49,798
Man, I am sorry.
Did I spill on your girlfriend?

161
00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:52,299
'cause I can get you and your lady
another drink.

162
00:08:53,258 --> 00:08:55,808
I believe our manhood
was just assailed.

163
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,871
I believe you're right.
What are we going to do about this?

164
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,998
I know what
I'm going to do about it.

165
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:05,805
Fuck, I knew it.

166
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,830
Couple of real-life faggots.

167
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,530
Charlie.

168
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:11,517
That's right, baby.

169
00:09:11,642 --> 00:09:14,595
We're here, we're queer,
and get used to it.

170
00:09:33,345 --> 00:09:35,347
You might want to think
about popping a breath mint

171
00:09:35,472 --> 00:09:38,809
or chewing some gum every now and again.
Your mouth tastes like a hobo's taint.

172
00:09:38,934 --> 00:09:40,909
Why you got to make me feel
self-conscious.

173
00:09:41,034 --> 00:09:43,553
Do you have gum
or a breath mint or something?

174
00:09:43,678 --> 00:09:46,373
- What are we going to do now?
- Something fun?

175
00:09:48,168 --> 00:09:50,106
You want to go back to my place,
watch some Dvds?

176
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:51,754
The girls are out for the night.

177
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,969
I'm not going to watch pornography
with you, Charlie Runkle. Creeps me out.

178
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,174
We'll watch a regular movie.
I don't care.

179
00:09:58,299 --> 00:09:59,934
The last {\time you talked me
into }movie night,

180
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:02,661
I sat there and watched you
play pocket pool for two hours.

181
00:10:02,786 --> 00:10:04,842
Men should not experience
pornography together.

182
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:07,231
- It's unseemly.
- Excuse me, Mr. Morality.

183
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,002
I didn't know you had these rules
about home entertainment.

184
00:10:10,127 --> 00:10:12,872
You know what, the night is young.
It's in diapers, for Christ's sakes.

185
00:10:13,728 --> 00:10:16,847
What do you say, you and me,
we go on a good, old-fashioned bender?

186
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,877
- I could roll with that.
- You can?

187
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:22,938
- I can roll with it.
- Then, you roll with it, motherfucker.

188
00:10:23,063 --> 00:10:24,513
Proceeding to roll.

189
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:31,136
I think I'm sewing it up.

190
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,543
I tell you, seriously.
It has led me astray.

191
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,497
- Thank you.
- That's disgusting.

192
00:10:36,622 --> 00:10:39,623
And, also...
what's it going to solve?

193
00:10:40,423 --> 00:10:41,423
I'm lost.

194
00:10:41,648 --> 00:10:44,017
Are you talking
about your heart or your vagina?

195
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:48,522
Look at you.
Using all the proper names for things.

196
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,816
It is her father's favorite word.

197
00:10:51,461 --> 00:10:54,027
I'm speaking of my vagina,
sweetheart.

198
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,406
I don't have a heart anymore.
I lost that years ago.

199
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:00,718
I think it was the night
of the squirting incident.

200
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:01,785
Remember that?

201
00:11:04,116 --> 00:11:05,466
I'll say no more.

202
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,585
You know... You know what?
You had the fantasy.

203
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,839
I mean, how many people can say
that they slept with their teen idol?

204
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,134
How many people can say
they slept with Rick Springfield?

205
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,602
Only every tramp, ho, and thief
in greater L.A. County.

206
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:25,324
What was I thinking?

207
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:27,802
You don't put yourself
out there like that.

208
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:31,998
It was good... Because you owed it
to your younger self, right?

209
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:35,819
I mean, you needed to explore
that whole area.

210
00:11:36,056 --> 00:11:37,056
Really?

211
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:41,569
Were there any areas you explored
when you was in new york?

212
00:11:41,694 --> 00:11:43,118
I don't think we need to...

213
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,123
What, mom?

214
00:11:44,248 --> 00:11:46,748
Yes, please,
not in front of the child.

215
00:11:47,735 --> 00:11:50,102
Screw that.
Tonight, you're a grown's-up.

216
00:11:50,227 --> 00:11:52,777
You're out on girls' night out...
G.N.O.

217
00:11:53,378 --> 00:11:55,878
- You want a "zip" of my wine?
- Marce.

218
00:12:13,922 --> 00:12:15,072
Check it out.

219
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,037
<i>South of Heaven.</i>

220
00:12:17,774 --> 00:12:19,985
First edition, signed by the author.

221
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,907
Portrait of the artist
as a dirty young man.

222
00:12:22,412 --> 00:12:23,645
What did I inscribe?

223
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,244
"To Kelly: best oral ever."

224
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,085
Who is Kelly?

225
00:12:30,288 --> 00:12:31,438
I don't know.

226
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:35,712
- I think we should find out.
- Poor Kelly.

227
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,930
Sounds like she had mad skills.

228
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,441
Early Hank Moody,
going for 100 big ones.

229
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:44,223
That real money? Maybe in pesos.

230
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:47,063
That's 100% John Wayne-style
American dollar.

231
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:48,141
Shit.

232
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,146
People are willing to pay good money
for my early, beer-soaked ramblings?

233
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,725
I've increased in value.

234
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,982
The franklin mint can lick me
where the good Lord split me.

235
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,444
Shame the money doesn't go to you.
It goes to sleepy-eyes over there.

236
00:12:59,715 --> 00:13:01,947
No shit.
I do all the work.

237
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,791
And weird beard over there
profits off my words,

238
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:08,370
my autograph, my memories
of sweet gifted Kelly.

239
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:13,100
It must costs 100 $ a week to keep him
in tie dye, birkenstocks and crystals.

240
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:16,616
True that. And you know
there's no way I'm seeing my 10% either.

241
00:13:16,741 --> 00:13:19,047
You could use that ten-spot
right about now.

242
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,215
Right?

243
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:23,724
Cover me...
I'm going Abbie Hoffman on this shit.

244
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,065
- I got you.
- You know, Runkle.

245
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,349
Information...

246
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,977
- Take it on home.
- Wants to be free.

247
00:13:34,844 --> 00:13:36,189
I think we're good.

248
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:37,708
Let's go.

249
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:38,942
We bad.

250
00:13:39,798 --> 00:13:40,798
We bad.

251
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:42,129
Stop that.

252
00:13:42,735 --> 00:13:45,435
- Wait, let me get you covered, here.
- No.

253
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:48,493
- I what?
- Don't do that, you're an ass.

254
00:13:49,972 --> 00:13:52,058
Holy fuck, look at this.

255
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,825
The artist within
gets himself an entire table.

256
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,353
All right, how much does a first
ejaculate sir walter dali go for?

257
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:00,338
- 95 bucks.
- Yes.

258
00:14:00,984 --> 00:14:02,068
I win.

259
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,837
Suck it and taste it,
artist within my yam bag.

260
00:14:10,394 --> 00:14:12,215
Hold on a second,
I got to let one rip.

261
00:14:12,824 --> 00:14:13,903
Switch with me?

262
00:14:24,735 --> 00:14:25,735
Slow down!

263
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,324
Come on, man.

264
00:14:29,687 --> 00:14:30,687
Get up.

265
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:33,330
- I'm down. Man down.
- Get up.

266
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,559
- Get the man up.
- Okay, the man's up.

267
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,251
Don't fuck with the pinkberry.

268
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,500
We can't stop.
We can't stop.

269
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,006
You know there's no one
chasing you, right, dad?

270
00:14:44,572 --> 00:14:45,822
So there isn't.

271
00:14:47,815 --> 00:14:48,845
This is fun.

272
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:50,718
We have fun.

273
00:14:50,843 --> 00:14:52,873
Why are you looking at me
like that, you goon?

274
00:14:52,998 --> 00:14:54,559
Are you ready for an adventure?

275
00:14:55,642 --> 00:14:57,354
Please stop doing that
with your face.

276
00:14:57,711 --> 00:14:59,731
We should move to New York.

277
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,025
With our friends,
the Van der Moodys.

278
00:15:02,246 --> 00:15:03,109
I did it.

279
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,377
I got fired.

280
00:15:08,052 --> 00:15:10,367
That's it...
There's nothing tying us here, man.

281
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,411
You got dumped by a pervy rock star,
and I lost my job.

282
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,781
- Well, tell everybody.
- <i>Freedom's just another word for...</i>

283
00:15:19,032 --> 00:15:22,908
- <i>I'm a free bird...</i>
- He's freaking me out.

284
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:25,064
- Yeah, me too.
- This is what two white winters

285
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:26,439
will do to you.

286
00:15:26,564 --> 00:15:28,969
My deeny's sewn up
tighter than ever.

287
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,505
That was great, Charlie.
Congratulations.

288
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,310
The next stop
is the convenience store.

289
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:36,405
What kind of snacks do you like?

290
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,377
- Stop it.
- Because I... I like snacks.

291
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,647
It's past our bedtime.

292
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,357
What about us?
What about ours?

293
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,672
Way past your bedtime.
Come on.

294
00:15:44,797 --> 00:15:47,279
No, you know what?
You get to put yourself to bed tonight.

295
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,862
You change your own diapers

296
00:15:48,987 --> 00:15:51,324
and wipe your own ass.
I am done being your mommy.

297
00:15:52,402 --> 00:15:54,184
But could you just please...

298
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:57,562
Could you say ass one more time again?
Because I can work with that for days.

299
00:15:57,687 --> 00:16:00,089
I want you to have this.
It's your heritage and your inheritance.

300
00:16:00,214 --> 00:16:02,798
- I liberated it just moments ago.
- What is that?

301
00:16:02,923 --> 00:16:04,170
Stop it.

302
00:16:06,518 --> 00:16:07,846
Who's Kelly?

303
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,877
I've been thinking about that
for ten minutes. She's either...

304
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:15,695
a cocktail waitress from Toronto

305
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,676
or a very promising
young marine biologist.

306
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:20,928
Either way, your father's
very lucky to have known her.

307
00:16:21,053 --> 00:16:22,606
Okay, that's it.
Let's go.

308
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:25,279
- Bye.
- Your loss, ladies.

309
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,566
I guess you're never going to know
the splendor of a cheese doodle burp.

310
00:16:28,691 --> 00:16:31,364
- Stop selling, Runkle. Come on.
- Good point.

311
00:16:36,508 --> 00:16:37,508
Good evening.

312
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:40,557
I think she liked me.

313
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,446
- Kim, wasabi?
- Wasabi?

314
00:16:48,571 --> 00:16:50,837
Living the dreams, Hank.
Living the dream.

315
00:16:51,112 --> 00:16:52,761
You get the booze.
I'll get the snacks.

316
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,703
This is all the snack
a brother needs.

317
00:16:54,828 --> 00:16:57,434
You got your guilty pleasures.
I got mine. I like...

318
00:16:59,763 --> 00:17:01,186
The humanity.

319
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,314
- Jesus, Hank. Come on.
- I'm sorry, Kim.

320
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:07,099
- I'll pay for it.
- You bet your ass you pay for it.

321
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:08,224
Shit, man.

322
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,447
You got scolded.
I heard it.

323
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,790
I saw that.

324
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,039
Saw what, homie?

325
00:17:23,164 --> 00:17:25,377
- What are you doing? Put that back.
- The fuck you care?

326
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,690
What do I care?
Kim and his wife...

327
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,799
Kim are good people, and you're
stealing from them. You need money,

328
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,771
get a paper route.
That's bullshit.

329
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:34,344
- Whatever.
- Whatever?

330
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:36,471
The kid's stealing.
That's not cool.

331
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,880
He's a kid, and need I remind you,
we borrowed ourselves

332
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:41,017
some hardcover nonfiction
this very evening?

333
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,940
- That is totally different.
- Of course.

334
00:17:43,065 --> 00:17:45,522
There's no law against an author
stealing his own work.

335
00:17:45,837 --> 00:17:47,107
What about Julian?

336
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:50,694
There's no law against stealing
from a colossal douchebag.

337
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,362
Check this out. I got an idea.

338
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,689
No, it's cool.

339
00:17:55,151 --> 00:17:57,283
You put that shit back,
and I'll give you this book.

340
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,432
It'll change your life.
Put you on the straight and narrow.

341
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:02,394
If it doesn't,
use it as toilet paper.

342
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,942
Check it out.
The artist within.

343
00:18:06,362 --> 00:18:07,293
My ass.

344
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,561
Here you go.

345
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,501
Take it. Shut up, Charlie,
I'm schooling this kid.

346
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:17,790
- Give me your fucking wallet, man.
- Just take it easy.

347
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:21,850
- Hurry the fuck up, man.
- You win. Settle down. You got it.

348
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,852
- Take it easy.
- Shut the fuck up.

349
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,020
Just take it.
Treat yourself.

350
00:18:29,035 --> 00:18:31,484
Are you kidding me?
What the fuck? What the fuck is this?

351
00:18:31,841 --> 00:18:34,070
- I work on commission, bro.
- Shut the fuck up.

352
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,825
You think this is a fucking joke?

353
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,574
I got a daughter.

354
00:18:42,724 --> 00:18:46,499
Get out of my store, motherfuckers!
Get out!

355
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,327
You motherfuckers!

356
00:18:51,188 --> 00:18:53,340
- Get back here!
- Fuck me.

357
00:19:21,443 --> 00:19:23,051
I thought that was it, Hank.

358
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:26,524
- The end.
- I know what you mean, broheme.

359
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:30,712
What was going through your head?

360
00:19:31,331 --> 00:19:32,420
What do you think?

361
00:19:33,586 --> 00:19:34,886
Karen and Becca.

362
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,908
And how much I love them.

363
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:40,551
And how much time I've wasted
being a selfish prick.

364
00:19:41,176 --> 00:19:44,326
What a cosmic fuck-you it would be
if you were the last person I kissed

365
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:46,601
- before I died.
- I don't know.

366
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,687
I think it would have been
kind of poetic, actually.

367
00:19:50,246 --> 00:19:51,314
For you, maybe.

368
00:19:53,354 --> 00:19:55,003
I know what you mean, though.

369
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:57,672
I had my whole life
flash before my eyes, really.

370
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:00,816
Just like...
Like a tivo on fast-forward.

371
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:02,631
And you know what?

372
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:04,849
It was really fucking pathetic.

373
00:20:04,974 --> 00:20:06,174
I believe you.

374
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:14,087
What now?
Where do we go from here?

375
00:20:14,402 --> 00:20:17,037
I'm not entirely sure.
If you thought we were drinking before,

376
00:20:17,162 --> 00:20:19,362
you were dead wrong because now...

377
00:20:20,255 --> 00:20:22,320
We are going to do some drinking.
You with me?

378
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,368
Till the end, my Nubian brother.

379
00:20:25,493 --> 00:20:26,993
Till the bitter end.

380
00:20:29,211 --> 00:20:32,461
- I love you, bro.
- Settle down. Don't soil yourself.

381
00:20:33,664 --> 00:20:34,664
Again.

382
00:20:35,913 --> 00:20:37,713
Make the car go very fast.

383
00:20:40,012 --> 00:20:41,471
Okay, just one drink.

384
00:20:41,596 --> 00:20:43,157
So that missy here

385
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,119
doesn't slit her wrists
when she's left all alone.

386
00:20:46,773 --> 00:20:49,080
But you forget.
I won't be alone.

387
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,222
'cause I got Yertle the turtle
as my roommate.

388
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,628
All the disadvantages
of being married

389
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,673
- and none of the advantages.
- And what would those be,

390
00:20:58,984 --> 00:21:01,771
- if you don't mind my asking?
- Those what?

391
00:21:01,896 --> 00:21:03,996
The advantages of being married.

392
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,015
I need to know so I don't end up
as bitter as you guys.

393
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,707
Shit, is that how we sound?

394
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:11,581
So far I haven't heard much
in the pro-men column.

395
00:21:11,706 --> 00:21:14,499
The best you can hope for, I guess,
is that they make you laugh

396
00:21:14,624 --> 00:21:16,733
and occasionally fix things
around the house.

397
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:19,102
That would be great.

398
00:21:20,348 --> 00:21:22,530
I would kill for a guy
to fix things around the house.

399
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,158
- What we meant to say was...
- Don't look at me.

400
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,419
I know I'm bitter.

401
00:21:26,866 --> 00:21:29,662
I own that shit.
I ams who I's ams.

402
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,998
Well, I'm not bitter.
Am I bitter?

403
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:34,484
Maybe I am.

404
00:21:34,956 --> 00:21:38,424
I'm disillusioned. That's what I am.
I'm definitely disillusioned.

405
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,756
Come on, mom.
What did you think would happen?

406
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:43,426
Did you think if you left
he would grow up all of a sudden?

407
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:44,964
No, I just...

408
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:48,134
You know, I wish we didn't
have to prop him up all the time.

409
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:51,309
What's the point in wishing something
that's never going to come true?

410
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,855
He's never going to change, mom.
He's always going to be

411
00:21:56,117 --> 00:21:59,067
that drunken fool
in the middle of Abbot Kinney.

412
00:22:00,232 --> 00:22:02,382
The same guy who wrote this book.

413
00:22:06,044 --> 00:22:09,285
And if that's not what you want,
then you have b be the one to walk away.

414
00:22:10,217 --> 00:22:11,817
Because he never will.

415
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:18,503
I love this little Buddha
you shot out of your vag.

416
00:22:19,435 --> 00:22:21,130
So wise.

417
00:22:48,222 --> 00:22:51,035
Feel like I've been fucked
in the ass by God himself.

418
00:22:52,488 --> 00:22:53,488
And he...

419
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,064
He pulled out
and jizzed all over my face.

420
00:22:57,594 --> 00:23:00,503
Got in my eyes, and now
I can't even open them properly.

421
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:01,801
I'm hungry.

422
00:23:02,306 --> 00:23:03,195
You?

423
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,875
So our ladies must be
worried sick about us?

424
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,150
You know why?

425
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:08,428
Why?

426
00:23:09,278 --> 00:23:11,136
'cause we're
a couple of dirty stay-outs.

427
00:23:11,261 --> 00:23:12,599
No missed calls.

428
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:18,713
Me neither.

429
00:23:20,329 --> 00:23:21,579
Well, whatever.

430
00:23:24,246 --> 00:23:26,821
This was fun.
We should do this more often.

431
00:23:27,393 --> 00:23:30,243
You know, I can do this
because I'm an artist.

432
00:23:30,781 --> 00:23:33,403
But you?
You're a fucking businessman.

433
00:23:33,528 --> 00:23:36,622
A sucker in a three-piece suit.
You got to keep your shit together.

434
00:23:37,118 --> 00:23:40,126
- Doesn't sound very fair at all.
- I didn't make the rules.

435
00:23:45,146 --> 00:23:48,396
You know, you're a good friend,
you bald motherfucker.

436
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,136
I'm lucky to have you.

437
00:23:50,261 --> 00:23:51,611
Same here, buddy.

438
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:54,431
You're a really good kisser,
too, you know that?

439
00:23:54,556 --> 00:23:56,992
Karen doesn't know
what she's missing right now.

440
00:23:57,929 --> 00:24:00,757
There's a good chance
I would have forgotten about that.

441
00:24:00,882 --> 00:24:02,356
Thanks for calling it back.

442
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:05,191
God, I am sore.

443
00:24:07,075 --> 00:24:09,075
My fucking back is killing me.

444
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:11,874
Got quite a workout last night?

445
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,770
Did we get tattoos last night?

446
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,495
Did we what?

447
00:24:30,681 --> 00:24:31,881
What did I do?

448
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:34,497
I don't know,
but we're about to find out.

449
00:24:34,622 --> 00:24:36,560
Bend over, big boy,
and drop your drawers.

450
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:39,018
And I hope that's the last time
I ever say that to you.

451
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,486
Jesus Christ, say it ain't so, Hank.

452
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:44,482
It is so.

453
00:24:45,171 --> 00:24:46,941
It is definitely so.

454
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:51,028
Why would you let me do that?
Why would you let me get a tramp stamp?

455
00:24:51,153 --> 00:24:53,482
- Why would you do that to me?
- Look on the bright side.

456
00:24:53,607 --> 00:24:55,085
It's a beautiful tattoo.

457
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,405
The artist definitely
outdid his self.

458
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:01,332
Jesus Christ,
it's a god damn butterfly, isn't it?

459
00:25:01,647 --> 00:25:04,072
Now I remember.
It's all coming back to me.

460
00:25:04,442 --> 00:25:06,512
I'm such a fucking idiot.

461
00:25:07,023 --> 00:25:09,229
Okay, all right, come on.
Let's go.

462
00:25:09,354 --> 00:25:12,379
We're going to the removal place
right now. Let's go.

463
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:18,748
Come on, let's go!

464
00:25:37,341 --> 00:25:39,191
- Good morning.
- Morning.

465
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:42,332
How was your night?

466
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,838
You know, it was great.
It was really good.

467
00:25:44,963 --> 00:25:45,963
Great.

468
00:25:46,615 --> 00:25:47,615
Yours?

469
00:25:47,818 --> 00:25:49,368
Mine was interesting.

470
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,865
Definitely had its moments.

471
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:56,703
I didn't fuck anyone,
if that's what you're wondering.

472
00:25:57,999 --> 00:26:00,132
No, I wasn't, actually.

473
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:02,399
Bullshit.

474
00:26:03,434 --> 00:26:04,534
How's Marcy?

475
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,580
She'll live, you know.

476
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,200
Well, that's good.

477
00:26:09,814 --> 00:26:11,414
And you?
How are you?

478
00:26:13,312 --> 00:26:14,362
I'm trying.

479
00:26:16,138 --> 00:26:17,988
That's all anybody can ask.

480
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:20,543
Right.

481
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,970
Check this out.

482
00:26:28,742 --> 00:26:30,592
- Hank, don't...
- No, no.

483
00:26:41,005 --> 00:26:44,405
- Am I supposed to be impressed?
- That's the idea, yeah.

484
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,525
I scar myself for you.

485
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,111
I stigmatize myself for you.

486
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,986
And that's all I get
as a response: "hmm"?

487
00:27:09,104 --> 00:27:10,354
Are you hungry?

488
00:27:15,474 --> 00:27:16,842
Would you like some breakfast?

489
00:27:19,702 --> 00:27:21,888
I would love some breakfast.
