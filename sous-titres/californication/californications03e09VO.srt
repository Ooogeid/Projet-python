1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:02,126
<i>Previously on </i>Californication...

2
00:00:02,432 --> 00:00:06,005
My dirty little whore of a nose
is sorry that she let you down.

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,381
I wanna fix this.

4
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,593
Come on, say it, baby, say it.

5
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,511
I'm getting fucked
by Rick Springfield.

6
00:00:13,148 --> 00:00:15,222
Do you want to... go up to my room

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,766
and listen to some records?

8
00:00:17,274 --> 00:00:19,435
- Only if they're mine.
- Church.

9
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:21,003
You're my student.

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,439
Not anymore, I'm not.

11
00:00:23,564 --> 00:00:26,192
I offered myself to you,
and you weren't interested.

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,527
If only I could have just had
one little nibble.

13
00:00:33,474 --> 00:00:35,368
I'm in love with you, Hank Moody.

14
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,113
Were you sleeping with your T.A.

15
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:41,096
the whole time
you were sleeping with me?

16
00:00:42,246 --> 00:00:43,626
Your dad's fucking my mom!

17
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,795
So what, we just pack up
and leave L.A.?

18
00:00:45,963 --> 00:00:47,630
The three of us move back
to New York?

19
00:00:47,957 --> 00:00:49,298
Yeah. End of the semester.

20
00:00:49,613 --> 00:00:50,591
Whatever.

21
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:08,017
Go ahead.
You've earned the right.

22
00:01:08,142 --> 00:01:09,610
Can't deny this privilege.

23
00:01:10,206 --> 00:01:11,692
Fire my ass.

24
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,781
I'm not planning to fire you.

25
00:01:14,082 --> 00:01:16,200
- Come again?
- Unfortunately, not a single one

26
00:01:16,508 --> 00:01:18,888
of the ladies
that you so egregiously fouled

27
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:21,497
has agreed to stand up
and press formal charges against you.

28
00:01:21,787 --> 00:01:24,750
And without that, the matter ends here.
You win, Hank Moody.

29
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:27,002
I admit defeat.
Not even my wife

30
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,470
will say a bad word about you.
Or should I say ex-wife?

31
00:01:31,084 --> 00:01:33,467
Just this morning,
she requested I vacate the premises.

32
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,094
Oh, no, she didn't!

33
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,907
- Yes, she did.
- You can't...

34
00:01:37,032 --> 00:01:38,898
You can't kick the Dean
out of the deanery.

35
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:41,411
That shit is wrong.
You've gotta get that woman back.

36
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:43,728
I can help you.
What do you want me to do? Just ask me.

37
00:01:44,175 --> 00:01:46,772
Ask me... What can I do?
I've got a question.

38
00:01:47,255 --> 00:01:49,275
No, not now.
Hold on, I got a call.

39
00:01:52,307 --> 00:01:54,530
M. Flower.
I don't recognize that number.

40
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,949
- I don't need to take it.
- Mayflower, moron.

41
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:59,243
Mayflower school for girls.
That could be important!

42
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,047
Yes, I'll...
I'll hold for principal Green

43
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:12,757
on a disciplinary matter.

44
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:15,342
I will also hold
for principal Green.

45
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,262
Oh, this is principal Green.

46
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,847
I'm handling it here.
I got it.

47
00:02:21,422 --> 00:02:22,850
I'm listening.
A fight?

48
00:02:23,615 --> 00:02:27,313
A disagreement, you mean, an argument.
That kind of fight.

49
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,229
- What kind of fight?
- A physical confrontation.

50
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:32,485
That's my girl.

51
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:22,618
I assure you that expulsion
is not a step we take lightly.

52
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,454
- Expulsion?
- Slow down, Dean Koons.

53
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:27,331
Not so much fun on the other side

54
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,458
- of the desk, is it?
- Let's just wait

55
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,002
- and see what she has to say.
- She's such a kiss-ass!

56
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,505
After all,
she didn't say that both girls...

57
00:03:34,835 --> 00:03:36,298
They're both being expelled.

58
00:03:37,054 --> 00:03:41,595
We have a zero-tolerance policy
on violence at the Mayflower school.

59
00:03:41,857 --> 00:03:43,931
We've just never had
to apply it before,

60
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,646
since most of our young ladies
have been taught

61
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:50,771
not to resort to physical violence
as a means of expression.

62
00:03:51,947 --> 00:03:54,547
So...
Let's look at the bright side here.

63
00:03:55,507 --> 00:03:57,903
We're making history.
Big ups for women's rights.

64
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,488
You know what?
This is wrong.

65
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,324
There is just no way
that Becca would hit anyone.

66
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,224
Right.
Not without being provoked.

67
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:06,203
We're not a family
that takes shit lying down.

68
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:08,372
- He admitted it was Becca's fault.
- I didn't.

69
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,207
- Did too. Did.
- I didn't.

70
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:12,408
Principal Green,
I'm sure that there's no need

71
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:15,713
to take drastic action that might impact
the girls' academic future.

72
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:19,476
Chelsea was clearly upset yesterday
because her father was moving out.

73
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:21,552
I tried to explain
that it wasn't Hank's fault.

74
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,431
- What's she talking about?
- I don't know. That accent...

75
00:04:26,258 --> 00:04:27,408
I'm so sorry.

76
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:29,643
- Hank's fault?
- You didn't tell her.

77
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:33,949
Tell me what?

78
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:36,859
Becca's father and I
had a slight, well, indiscretion

79
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:39,361
that may have contributed...
Indirectly, though...

80
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,530
- To the girls' kafufe.
- She's kidding, right?

81
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,407
You're kidding?

82
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:45,539
He fucks my wife,
I somehow ended up

83
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:47,198
sleeping at the faculty club.

84
00:04:47,323 --> 00:04:49,323
You're making this worse
than it has to be.

85
00:04:49,448 --> 00:04:50,456
I don't think so.

86
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,665
You! You...

87
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,334
You say one word to me,

88
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:56,045
and I will show you
where Becca learned to throw down.

89
00:05:01,853 --> 00:05:03,853
Hey, there, Minnie Mouse.

90
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,431
Shouldn't you be dressed
and ready for action?

91
00:05:07,665 --> 00:05:09,856
I mean waxin'.
Action waxin'.

92
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:12,949
You get it? It rhymes.
Action waxin'.

93
00:05:13,643 --> 00:05:14,643
Bite me.

94
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,398
Still no call from Rick Springfield.

95
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,272
You don't have to sound
so chipper about it.

96
00:05:22,397 --> 00:05:25,344
The man's been in Tahoe
for the past three days.

97
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:27,146
I know, I know.

98
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,458
That was a huge show for him.
He's probably just decompressing now.

99
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,633
Sure, sure.

100
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:34,708
Or maybe...

101
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:37,193
He's trying to tell you something.

102
00:05:38,332 --> 00:05:41,298
You know, this could be
a blessing in disguise, really.

103
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:43,050
He'll call.

104
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:44,377
Maybe.

105
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,567
Or... Maybe not.

106
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:52,184
You know, maybe Rick Springfield
not calling you for three days

107
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:55,854
is his way of saying
that he doesn't see the real you,

108
00:05:56,237 --> 00:05:58,899
that he doesn't...
value your essential

109
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,317
woman-ness and so forth.

110
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,529
Would you please mind
your own business?

111
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,406
Rick Springfield is my business.

112
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,360
He's my client, for Christ sakes.

113
00:06:07,485 --> 00:06:09,702
You know, I'll tell you something.
I have seen some things,

114
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:11,705
up close and personal,

115
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,977
some strangely fucked-up shit.

116
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:17,751
That guy...
He's not the biggest friend to women.

117
00:06:19,552 --> 00:06:21,755
And you're frigging
Bella Abzug over here.

118
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,633
- Far from it.
- No, I totally get it...

119
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,594
I'm dating my dream crush...

120
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:29,448
Hitting my peak sexually,

121
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:32,933
this close to selling
this frigid box of a house,

122
00:06:33,431 --> 00:06:36,812
and moving on with my life,
and you just don't want me to be happy.

123
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,982
Of course I want you
to be happy, Marcy.

124
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,957
God, I mean, look,
we're talking here, okay?

125
00:06:43,082 --> 00:06:45,374
I miss this.
I miss us.

126
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:47,154
Do you know how long it's been

127
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,241
since I've heard you say
those three little words?

128
00:06:50,253 --> 00:06:51,353
Eat my clam?

129
00:06:51,772 --> 00:06:54,364
Eat my clam...
No, no, not eat my clam.

130
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:55,539
I love you.

131
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,059
I don't mean to get a bee in my bonnet.
I don't wanna see you waste your life

132
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:02,713
waiting for a phone call
that might never come.

133
00:07:03,762 --> 00:07:05,307
Oh, it's coming, fool.

134
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:09,179
And by the way, my gay uncle called.
He wants his expressions back.

135
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:19,146
Guess it's homeschooling after all.

136
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:22,628
You better hope
that he remembers his algebra,

137
00:07:22,753 --> 00:07:25,944
because you definitely won't be going
to a New York private school after this.

138
00:07:26,377 --> 00:07:27,917
Obviously, she was provoked.

139
00:07:28,503 --> 00:07:30,249
She called you a home wrecker...

140
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,034
Which you are.

141
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,079
Yet somehow that didn't stop me from
shoving her into the vending machine.

142
00:07:35,643 --> 00:07:37,331
Then the hitting began.

143
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:38,685
Satisfied?

144
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:44,755
I asked you to do one thing.

145
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,614
Look after Becca.
How hard is that?

146
00:07:47,952 --> 00:07:48,952
Hard.

147
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,844
Real hard.
I understand that now.

148
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,989
It couldn't have been that hard,
could it?

149
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:55,847
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know what that means.

150
00:07:57,006 --> 00:07:59,751
- You're mad about Felicia?
- I would not give you the satisfaction

151
00:07:59,876 --> 00:08:01,271
of being mad about Felicia.

152
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,232
I don't know how satisfying
that would be.

153
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,567
While I'm working my ass off
in New York,

154
00:08:05,837 --> 00:08:07,402
you start some kind of relationship

155
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:10,155
with the most annoying
woman on the planet,

156
00:08:10,586 --> 00:08:13,408
who also happens to be the mother
of Becca's best friend

157
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,335
and your boss!
What is...

158
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,706
It's not a relationship,
Karen, far from it.

159
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,415
You know that. She was just
looking to sleep with someone...

160
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:22,179
Anyone... Get her groove back,

161
00:08:22,304 --> 00:08:24,336
get back at the Dean,
and I didn't want to.

162
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,689
I thought it was a bad idea.
It seemed wrong to me.

163
00:08:26,814 --> 00:08:28,924
We don't like to get involved
in people's marital woes,

164
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:32,393
'cause we've been there. That's shit,
and I wanted to keep us out of it.

165
00:08:32,518 --> 00:08:35,454
You did a really good job
of not getting involved, Hank.

166
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:37,440
I did, at first.
I refused.

167
00:08:37,565 --> 00:08:39,977
But then she was gonna call in
her chip with this other dude,

168
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,062
this Mr. Zipless fuck,
a real cheeseball...

169
00:08:42,444 --> 00:08:43,944
You know what?
Out.

170
00:08:45,894 --> 00:08:49,195
I don't want to hear about Felicia
and her... midlife crisis, okay?

171
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,269
Do you have any idea
how fucking infuriating you are?

172
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:56,201
Yes, I do. I'm just trying to fill you
in on what happened while you were away.

173
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,078
Leave now, okay?

174
00:08:58,347 --> 00:09:00,438
I need... I need peace, Hank.

175
00:09:01,297 --> 00:09:03,679
You must have something to do,
I mean some...

176
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:05,919
papers to grade,
some fucking marijuana to smoke,

177
00:09:06,624 --> 00:09:08,088
some students to fuck.

178
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,258
So you'd be totally fine if I...

179
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,536
Pipes of a fuking angel.

180
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,749
I gotta take this down and play it
for the girls at the orphanage.

181
00:09:44,368 --> 00:09:46,756
I'm doing
a children's charity concert at...

182
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:48,962
the grove Thursday night.
Half the proceeds

183
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,215
go to juvenile diabetes.

184
00:09:54,922 --> 00:09:56,136
I'm speechless.

185
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:58,647
Girls at the orphanage?
Juvenile diabetes?

186
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:00,583
Who are you two,
and what have you done

187
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,399
with the nymphomaniacal sociopaths
I've grown to love and loathe?

188
00:10:03,524 --> 00:10:05,391
Sorry to burst your bubble, Runkle.

189
00:10:06,076 --> 00:10:08,774
- I'm a complicated beast.
- Me too.

190
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,443
Plus, charity events are like
ground zero for single pussy.

191
00:10:11,948 --> 00:10:14,415
- And he's back.
- You should have seen me in Tahoe.

192
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,532
Two nights, six chicks...
No rubbers.

193
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:18,546
Bravo, Rick.

194
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,329
Safety first, I always say,
of course.

195
00:10:22,864 --> 00:10:24,323
But then again,

196
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:28,377
I'm not the one who's currently having
intimate relations with my wife.

197
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,879
Can it, Runkle.
Life's messy.

198
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,881
You better clean up
your game, gonzo...

199
00:10:33,006 --> 00:10:35,610
The womanizing, the boozing.
If you won't do it for Marcy,

200
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,595
at least do it for your career.
We have landed you

201
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:42,307
the comeback vehicle of a lifetime.
Please don't fuck it up.

202
00:10:42,695 --> 00:10:45,756
Don't use the "c" word, all right?
I'm not coming back from anything.

203
00:10:46,151 --> 00:10:47,936
That reminds me...
I need some blow.

204
00:10:51,132 --> 00:10:52,132
Sorry?

205
00:10:52,673 --> 00:10:55,737
Dude, you heard me.
Some blow, some yay, some white girl,

206
00:10:55,983 --> 00:10:58,490
some powder, some cake.
I start filming tomorrow.

207
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,862
It's my last chance
to get fucked out of my mind.

208
00:11:00,987 --> 00:11:03,134
All due respect, '80s rock star,

209
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:05,289
you'd've a better line
on cocaine than I would.

210
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,960
So why are you asking me to procure
you drugs like I'm your assistant?

211
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:12,879
Let me see.
Because I fucking can.

212
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,382
I don't think I like your tone, bud,

213
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:16,832
not one little bit.

214
00:11:18,365 --> 00:11:19,428
9:00 p.m.,

215
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,320
my trailer on set.

216
00:11:29,006 --> 00:11:30,397
Christ, Runkle.

217
00:11:30,638 --> 00:11:31,565
Sack up!

218
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,651
If a client asks you
to dress up like a french maid

219
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:38,655
and rim his shit-hole,
you comply, with bells on.

220
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,832
I would hook him up myself,
but my guy's in Thailand...

221
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:44,790
Just some sex tourism,
something like that, anyway.

222
00:11:45,134 --> 00:11:46,443
So this one's on you.

223
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,011
Almost forgot.
Here.

224
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:50,867
Annual bonus.

225
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:53,837
Don't spend it all
in one place, ladyboy.

226
00:12:00,923 --> 00:12:02,447
This does seem mighty small.

227
00:12:02,572 --> 00:12:05,697
I think I got a bigger bonus check
when I worked at Blockbuster in '91.

228
00:12:05,822 --> 00:12:07,445
Wait, wait.
Be kind, rewind.

229
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,648
Hank Moody worked at Blockbuster?

230
00:12:09,773 --> 00:12:11,813
I had the khakis,
the tucked-in polo.

231
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,775
The whole thing. I used to splice porn
into the Disney films.

232
00:12:15,178 --> 00:12:16,434
Of course you did.

233
00:12:16,968 --> 00:12:18,268
But back to you.

234
00:12:18,764 --> 00:12:20,708
How does this all make you feel...

235
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:23,359
Emotionally?

236
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:31,114
Between my sad little bonus check
and my new position

237
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:33,502
as Rick Springfield's
drug dealer/pimp,

238
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,545
I would have to say

239
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,798
I feel like shit emotionally.

240
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:41,065
Enough! I've grown tired
of your jibber-jabber, Runkle.

241
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,803
My turn.
Let's switch it up.

242
00:12:49,441 --> 00:12:50,891
Becca got expelled.

243
00:12:52,143 --> 00:12:55,161
- She went all Leon Spinks on her bff.
- Really?

244
00:12:55,746 --> 00:12:57,609
Is it creepy that I find that
mildly arousing?

245
00:13:00,308 --> 00:13:01,185
Continue.

246
00:13:01,904 --> 00:13:03,886
Karen is livid,
as well she should be.

247
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:06,366
I honestly don't know
how it all got so out of hand.

248
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:09,454
Chelsea and Becca were thick as thieves,
once upon a time, like you and me.

249
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:13,208
The Dean's been kicked of the deanery.
Felicia did that, and that ain't right.

250
00:13:14,435 --> 00:13:16,838
And I should be happy.
I know I should, because...

251
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,686
we're all packing up
and moving to New York soon.

252
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,678
Are you weeping?

253
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,760
I need cocaine!

254
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:34,389
- And this concerns me how?
- I don't know!

255
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,923
I just... I might get fired!

256
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:41,069
Collini doesn't give a shit about me.
Marcy, she's a fucking stranger.

257
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:43,321
No one takes care of me!

258
00:13:44,977 --> 00:13:48,551
Now you, you're leaving me too.
You're moving back to New York.

259
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,672
Big boy.

260
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,388
Sorry.

261
00:14:03,513 --> 00:14:06,013
Am I interrupting something,
professor Moody?

262
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,929
Just a complete
psychological breakdown.

263
00:14:09,054 --> 00:14:11,766
I'm just picking up my essay.
Jill said she graded them.

264
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:13,529
Rock on.

265
00:14:18,263 --> 00:14:20,238
And you should hit up
Dave Edelstein.

266
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,149
Kind of a douche, but his coke

267
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:24,738
is the fucking truth.

268
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:29,953
What?

269
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,471
It's a great study aid.

270
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,872
Plus, it suppresses my gag reflex.

271
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:35,930
Good for... You know.

272
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,044
Noted.
And dismissed.

273
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,383
Shotgun?

274
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:51,973
They're not gonna hear that.

275
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,515
An unreliable drug dealer,
the fucking gall.

276
00:14:55,456 --> 00:14:57,312
- We tried.
- That's you trying?

277
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,012
- What?
- No wonder my last book didn't sell.

278
00:15:01,273 --> 00:15:02,564
Cheese it, the cops.

279
00:15:05,683 --> 00:15:06,618
Unlocked.

280
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:08,502
Go, go!

281
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:18,833
Come on.

282
00:15:29,777 --> 00:15:32,229
Flashlight...
Stealthy, secure.

283
00:15:32,354 --> 00:15:34,326
I hate to say it,
but it's highly likely.

284
00:15:34,451 --> 00:15:35,745
Maybe in the labia.

285
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,686
Vas definitely.

286
00:15:38,194 --> 00:15:40,105
- I would, check it out.
- Shit!

287
00:15:40,951 --> 00:15:43,029
Looks a little like you.
Check it.

288
00:15:43,573 --> 00:15:44,452
Go deep.

289
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,991
Dig in get in there.

290
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:54,452
Goddamn it.
It's sticky inside.

291
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,248
- What are you laughing at?
- 'cause I know where it is.

292
00:16:02,196 --> 00:16:03,927
You have got to be kidding me.

293
00:16:05,768 --> 00:16:09,509
Go ahead. I had a few when I was a kid.
They're like sweethearts with scales.

294
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,971
- Just do it.
- What is dis?

295
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:17,142
You're not such
a bad boy, really, are you?

296
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,433
You're a good little boy.

297
00:16:22,027 --> 00:16:23,607
That's a good boy.

298
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:31,007
That fucking thing fed upon me!

299
00:16:31,132 --> 00:16:33,952
That fucking goddamn monster
fucking ate my flesh.

300
00:16:34,808 --> 00:16:36,639
Jesus Christ,
what if it's poisonous?

301
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,872
I feel my heart slowing down.

302
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,077
- I think something is happening.
- Is there?

303
00:16:41,202 --> 00:16:43,828
You're becoming an even bigger pussy!
It's a garter snake.

304
00:16:43,953 --> 00:16:46,054
It's an overgrown earthworm.
You're fine.

305
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:48,962
Excuse me.
IDs. Now.

306
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,454
Actually, we're
We're just visiting.

307
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:54,190
- Who you visiting?
- His cousin.

308
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:56,639
Lover. His nephew.
David Edelstein.

309
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:01,770
Run, Runkle!

310
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,320
I'm sorry.

311
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,489
Sorry. Sorry.

312
00:17:14,224 --> 00:17:15,241
Sorry, sorry.

313
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,124
That's my left ball!
That's my right ball.

314
00:17:25,631 --> 00:17:27,045
No! Not the glans!

315
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:30,090
Runkle, save yourself.
Run!

316
00:17:31,278 --> 00:17:34,052
Easy on the cuffs there, bad lieutenant.
You're making a big mistake.

317
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,596
- Save it for the cops.
- I'm very tight with the Dean.

318
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,431
He won't be pleased
when he hears this.

319
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,434
- You're friends with the Dean?
- I fucked his wife.

320
00:17:43,674 --> 00:17:44,974
What, no dinner?

321
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,698
I didn't think you'd be hungry.

322
00:17:48,905 --> 00:17:49,905
I'm not.

323
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:51,799
No, me neither.

324
00:17:54,753 --> 00:17:57,742
Would you look at that?
We have something in common.

325
00:17:58,546 --> 00:18:00,453
That, and we're both pissed at him.

326
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,362
I'm not, because it would not be
appropriate for me to be...

327
00:18:03,487 --> 00:18:04,487
Mother.

328
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:06,251
Daughter.

329
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,546
I just wanna know
what is going on with my own life.

330
00:18:10,695 --> 00:18:13,645
- That seems reasonable.
- Basic, simple things.

331
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:15,510
Where am I going to school?

332
00:18:15,978 --> 00:18:18,878
Is he living with us?
Is he not living with us?

333
00:18:19,438 --> 00:18:21,307
Is someone in charge here, anyone?

334
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,520
Or are we just going on in
this fucked-up limbo forever and ever?

335
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,314
Sweetie, I know,
I know it doesn't make any sense.

336
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:31,376
You can't sweetie me.
I'm not six years old anymore.

337
00:18:31,886 --> 00:18:33,194
I need real answers.

338
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:34,519
I know.

339
00:18:34,644 --> 00:18:36,156
You're right, I'm sorry.

340
00:18:36,581 --> 00:18:38,450
And I know
that's nowhere near enough.

341
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:42,245
You see, I had a plan.

342
00:18:42,954 --> 00:18:43,954
I did.

343
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,625
But it just didn't work out
the way I thought it would.

344
00:18:48,024 --> 00:18:50,462
You thought he'd do
a good job of being in charge?

345
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:52,571
Right.

346
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,802
I have an idea.
Let's get outta here.

347
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,847
We've been coope up
all day long. We need fresh air.

348
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:02,917
Whatever.

349
00:19:03,465 --> 00:19:05,351
That was kind of a yes, wasn't it?

350
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:07,127
Come with me.

351
00:19:45,677 --> 00:19:46,702
Hey, man.

352
00:19:46,827 --> 00:19:49,604
You... You're really
hanging out down there, Rick.

353
00:19:50,262 --> 00:19:52,789
Yeah. I like to free-ball
with my eight ball.

354
00:19:54,229 --> 00:19:55,229
Evidently.

355
00:19:58,127 --> 00:19:59,127
Jesus.

356
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,753
Before I hand over the goods,

357
00:20:07,216 --> 00:20:09,791
I really feel like I need to get
something off my chest.

358
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,710
All right, Charlie. It's okay.
I was out of line today.

359
00:20:13,185 --> 00:20:14,295
I'm sorry.

360
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,381
You're my agent.
You're not my errand boy.

361
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:20,176
I'm surprised.

362
00:20:20,434 --> 00:20:23,478
Well, okay. Thank you, Rick.
I appreciate that.

363
00:20:23,603 --> 00:20:24,514
Okay. So?

364
00:20:25,477 --> 00:20:26,539
Coca!

365
00:20:26,664 --> 00:20:27,667
Absolutely.

366
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:30,478
I'm very thirsty. It was a long trip.
I see you got a cooler.

367
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,154
I need some refreshment.

368
00:20:40,983 --> 00:20:42,133
Where is she?

369
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,286
Marcy, where are you?
I know you're in here, Marcy.

370
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:53,793
I don't know what shocks me more...

371
00:20:54,315 --> 00:20:56,963
The fact that you've obviously
completely replaced me

372
00:20:57,695 --> 00:21:00,758
or that you jeopardize
your sobriety for this fuckwit!

373
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:05,382
This fuckwit happens to be
one of the kindest,

374
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,223
gentlest lovers I've ever known.

375
00:21:09,196 --> 00:21:12,315
I know a couple of strippers out there
who might dispute that assessment.

376
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,805
Hey, watch it, Runkle.
Gimme my fucking blow!

377
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:19,427
Where is it?

378
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,163
- You looking to get your ass fired?
- Impossible.

379
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,790
- Really? Why is that?
- Because I fire you first!

380
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,308
That's right. I don't care
how much business you bring in.

381
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:37,795
You're an emotional fucking
albatross, Rick Springfield,

382
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,560
- and I'm through with you!
- Charlie, perspective.

383
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:43,613
You wanna go back to slinging
beemers in the valley?

384
00:21:49,778 --> 00:21:51,428
Maybe I got carried away.

385
00:21:51,553 --> 00:21:53,091
What I meant to say is...

386
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,149
It's too late, fucker.
You're dead to me.

387
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:01,565
And you can tell that old cooze Collini
that the whole Harry Greenberg agency

388
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,071
is fuckin' dead to me too.

389
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:04,619
Fuck you!

390
00:22:04,985 --> 00:22:08,076
And fuck your Z3
and fuck your dumb bald head

391
00:22:08,605 --> 00:22:10,620
and your small, shitty life!

392
00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:13,178
Now, gimme my blow
and get the fuck outta here!

393
00:22:13,303 --> 00:22:14,303
Gladly.

394
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,044
Shit!

395
00:22:18,864 --> 00:22:20,213
What the fuck?

396
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,884
- Like your dream crush now, Marcy?
- Damn it!

397
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,602
It's like watching
a figure skater fall.

398
00:22:28,277 --> 00:22:30,730
Come on, baby, let's go.
We're getting out of here.

399
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:50,975
And the little bird said...

400
00:22:52,087 --> 00:22:53,087
Dad!

401
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,217
I thought you hated Chelsea.

402
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:58,799
Well, since when
did you care what I think?

403
00:22:59,242 --> 00:23:02,152
Anyway, the point is to say
what you wanted to say.

404
00:23:02,603 --> 00:23:03,603
Come on.

405
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,595
Don't be afraid.
We come in peace.

406
00:23:10,928 --> 00:23:12,681
Hello!
Chelsea!

407
00:23:12,806 --> 00:23:14,007
Look who's here!

408
00:23:14,132 --> 00:23:15,393
Come on in.

409
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:18,021
I see.
I'm just not sure I give a shit.

410
00:23:19,262 --> 00:23:22,483
I guess that's what passes
for a welcome around here these days.

411
00:23:23,108 --> 00:23:24,944
I just came to say I'm sorry

412
00:23:25,631 --> 00:23:27,488
for punching you in the face.

413
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,699
And calling you a stupid twat.

414
00:23:30,975 --> 00:23:33,411
- I was highly emotional.
- Look at that.

415
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,664
<i>Rapprochement...</i>
It's my favorite part of any war.

416
00:23:37,443 --> 00:23:39,759
Why don't you and Becca
go up to your room?

417
00:23:40,135 --> 00:23:42,295
It's not necessary, okay, dad?

418
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,764
- I'll finish dinner.
- It's fine.

419
00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:49,100
Now, if you two don't mind, I'm enjoying
some quality time with my dad...

420
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,138
Before he checks
into the heartbreak hotel.

421
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,880
We know.
We've been there already.

422
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:57,524
Come on, now, you don't have
to make it sound so dour.

423
00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:00,104
Well, that's a nice try,
but you want my opinion?

424
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,939
It's so much better
not to lie to them,

425
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,650
because they kinda know
when things are shitty.

426
00:24:04,906 --> 00:24:08,383
- I don't know that things...
- They're shitty, dad.

427
00:24:08,508 --> 00:24:09,508
Face it.

428
00:24:10,188 --> 00:24:11,532
All thanks to you know who.

429
00:24:12,562 --> 00:24:14,858
Look, it'd be nice if we could
blame Hank for all of this,

430
00:24:14,983 --> 00:24:18,709
but the fact of the matter is...
It's more complicated than that.

431
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,417
I'm not talking about Hank.
I'm talking about mom.

432
00:24:22,553 --> 00:24:25,421
- She's making an ass of herself.
- Well, that's true.

433
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,423
I'm going to my room.

434
00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:32,166
That's where I'll be, in case you want
to apologize further or something.

435
00:24:35,871 --> 00:24:39,393
You know, I'm sure she doesn't mean it.
Go on. Take a shot.

436
00:24:41,496 --> 00:24:42,746
You'll be okay.

437
00:24:51,481 --> 00:24:54,689
You know how we could really get back
at those significant others of ours,

438
00:24:54,814 --> 00:24:56,014
the two of us?

439
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:58,371
If we made love...

440
00:24:59,384 --> 00:25:01,416
That would really piss 'em off.

441
00:25:04,594 --> 00:25:05,909
Too soon?
You're right.

442
00:25:06,034 --> 00:25:07,249
It's too soon.

443
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:08,923
My heart needs to heal.

444
00:25:09,497 --> 00:25:11,634
Hell, I'm not even sure
the little Dean is up to it,

445
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,011
you know.

446
00:25:13,435 --> 00:25:15,809
- How about a glass of wine?
- Sold.

447
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:19,262
Free at last!

448
00:25:19,387 --> 00:25:22,562
You know, the air, it just smells better
after you've been in the big house.

449
00:25:22,836 --> 00:25:24,570
Thanks for doing this, by the way.

450
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:27,398
I can't believe you didn't have
anything better to do with your evening.

451
00:25:27,523 --> 00:25:29,759
Couldn't very well let you
rot in there, could I?

452
00:25:29,884 --> 00:25:31,320
Well, it's been done.

453
00:25:31,755 --> 00:25:34,157
I'm the one who made
the brilliant mistake of hiring you.

454
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,193
Yes, you did.

455
00:25:35,318 --> 00:25:37,192
And I never give up
on my brilliant mistakes.

456
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:38,927
I see them through
to the bitter end.

457
00:25:39,052 --> 00:25:41,497
Is that where we are?
Because I knew I recognized the place.

458
00:25:42,288 --> 00:25:43,786
I don't regret any of it,

459
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:47,865
despite the humiliation,
gossiping in the department,

460
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,478
or the end of my marriage.

461
00:25:49,603 --> 00:25:51,666
Shit. You gonna go through
with this divorce thing?

462
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:55,758
Sure. It's a wonderful feeling, once
you realize that it's all behind you.

463
00:25:55,883 --> 00:25:58,917
All that bitterness
and anguish and torment.

464
00:26:00,696 --> 00:26:03,176
I don't know.
I've been there. I have.

465
00:26:03,301 --> 00:26:05,007
But it wasn't like that for me.

466
00:26:05,132 --> 00:26:07,735
It was more like having a giant hole

467
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,196
ripped in my universe.

468
00:26:09,321 --> 00:26:11,527
Yeah, but you never
actually let go, did you?

469
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:15,182
It's the pain that holds people
together, the need to hurt one another.

470
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:17,006
Once that's gone,
there's nothing left.

471
00:26:17,131 --> 00:26:18,576
Nothing worth saving, anyway.

472
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:20,953
I don't accept that.
Where's the love, lady?

473
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:21,945
The love?

474
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,538
Yes. Where it be located?

475
00:26:23,663 --> 00:26:25,400
To misquote a '70s soul classic.

476
00:26:25,525 --> 00:26:27,501
Don't make me go roberta flack
on your ass.

477
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,686
That's love, torturing each other?

478
00:26:29,811 --> 00:26:31,194
Half in, half out?

479
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:34,967
- Torture. That sounds like love to me.
- You go on believing that if you like.

480
00:26:35,298 --> 00:26:37,037
I like.
That shit's romantic.

481
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,759
I've had quite enough torture
for one lifetime.

482
00:26:40,147 --> 00:26:42,308
Enough with doing the right thing.

483
00:26:42,657 --> 00:26:44,946
I never thought you'd be
one of those types, you know?

484
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:47,382
- The ones who suffer in silence.
- No, I'm not.

485
00:26:47,507 --> 00:26:49,690
I suffer very loudly.
You should try it sometime.

486
00:26:51,214 --> 00:26:53,974
No, thanks.
From now on, I'd just rather be happy.

487
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:56,821
So that's it?
You discovered the key to happiness

488
00:26:56,946 --> 00:26:58,574
in one short semester?

489
00:26:59,231 --> 00:27:01,106
Well, I did have a little help.

490
00:27:02,145 --> 00:27:03,545
Thanks, professor.

491
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,674
You know if you ever decide
to rethink that philosophy of yours,

492
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:10,899
let me know.

493
00:27:11,149 --> 00:27:12,399
I'll be around.
