1
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:02,046
'cause I was just kidding.

2
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:06,418
- You were kidding?
- I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous.

3
00:07:06,543 --> 00:07:08,343
He was just giving me notes
on a story.

4
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:12,667
We were talking about the ending,
actually, of the story, right?

5
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,300
- And he thinks it's over.
- Right.

6
00:07:15,425 --> 00:07:18,036
But I know that it's just begun.

7
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,345
But don't worry, dean Koons, really.

8
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,338
He's never done anything
even remotely inappropriate.

9
00:07:24,463 --> 00:07:26,820
Really, he's very boring

10
00:07:27,296 --> 00:07:28,746
and so not my type.

11
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,857
I like them darker,

12
00:07:31,515 --> 00:07:32,674
handsomer.

13
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:35,491
God, you have great eyebrows sir.

14
00:07:35,776 --> 00:07:37,790
A girl could really get lost
in those things.

15
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,542
- He's got pretty blue eyes, too.
- Gorgeous.

16
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,255
- Thank you, Jackie. Very kind of you.
- You're welcome.

17
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,882
Thanks for the help.

18
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,557
I'll show myself out.

19
00:07:54,164 --> 00:07:57,101
You have a thunderous erection
right now, don't you?

20
00:07:59,838 --> 00:08:02,538
I'll close the door,
give you some privacy.

21
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:08,026
Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's mama's sweet spot.

22
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:09,435
Lower.
Ah, lower.

23
00:08:10,155 --> 00:08:12,247
Another two inches,
I'll read your spec script.

24
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:14,910
- I don't do that.
- Oh, you're one of those?

25
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,455
No happy endings,
just cliff-hangers.

26
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,107
Well, get the fuck out of here!
I've grown weary. I have work to do.

27
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:23,712
Runkle! I need you on my carpet!

28
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:27,626
Crazy bitch.

29
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:30,417
Morning, sue.

30
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:35,742
That guy fired up the grill and walked
out of here with an uncooked wiener.

31
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:37,182
Can you believe that?

32
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,318
It's what happens when buddhists
commandeer a profession

33
00:08:40,443 --> 00:08:43,095
that rightfully belongs
to well-hung swedes.

34
00:08:43,518 --> 00:08:44,518
So it is.

35
00:08:45,154 --> 00:08:47,734
What about you?
Have you emptied the chamber today?

36
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:50,531
- Well, as a matter of fact...
- Of course you have.

37
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:51,728
You're Runkle.

38
00:08:51,853 --> 00:08:53,866
You'd whack it
to a cat dancing on Youtube.

39
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,785
But I'm in the mood.

40
00:08:57,513 --> 00:08:59,197
Want to fire off another round?

41
00:08:59,322 --> 00:09:00,906
Phone call for you, Sue.

42
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:04,042
You know better than to interrupt
me when I'm entertaining a gentleman.

43
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,210
It's him.

44
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:07,613
Him?

45
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:10,096
Everybody out.

46
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:19,339
How you doing?

47
00:09:20,562 --> 00:09:21,892
Everything good out here?

48
00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:25,522
You hip-pocketing anyone?
That was always my move as an assistant.

49
00:09:26,896 --> 00:09:28,442
I know she's seen your penis.

50
00:09:30,272 --> 00:09:32,917
Guess what, Rhonda, she's not alone,

51
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:35,240
11,000 hits on Redtube.

52
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:40,040
Don't go anywhere, Runkle.

53
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:42,709
I need you.

54
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:53,165
Jillybean, nice to see ya.

55
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:55,961
Classy.

56
00:09:56,452 --> 00:09:58,802
Moody, real table clothes.

57
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:02,434
You trying toto tell me something?
'cause I didn't even think we we dating.

58
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:03,648
For saying.

59
00:10:03,773 --> 00:10:05,773
That I interesting, because...

60
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,023
I've been doing some thinking,
and I wanted to...

61
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,274
- Yeah, me too.
- You have?

62
00:10:10,712 --> 00:10:13,090
- Ladies first.
- Actually, not that much thinking,

63
00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:14,787
just a medium amount of thinking,

64
00:10:14,912 --> 00:10:17,597
'cause too much with the thinking,
that does me in.

65
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:20,661
That's how I jinx things.
So now I'm just thinking it slow,

66
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:22,773
going day by day.

67
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:26,251
What were you gonna say?

68
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,415
- Here's the thing.
- Oh, my god.

69
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,344
Oh, my sweet fucking god.

70
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,429
- What?
- Jack.

71
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,154
My egg-waister.

72
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:43,225
That's the ex dull normal?

73
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,853
The guy I waited half a fucking decade
to propose to me.

74
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,355
- That guy?
- Yes!

75
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,204
And he dumped me,
in a place just like this...

76
00:10:51,561 --> 00:10:54,528
- Fucking italian food.
- Really? That is a dick move.

77
00:10:55,847 --> 00:10:57,020
And you know what else?

78
00:10:57,145 --> 00:10:59,283
He said it was unethical for him

79
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:02,240
to keep dating me,
knowing that I wanted to get married

80
00:11:02,365 --> 00:11:04,788
and have kids, and he wasn't ready
for those things.

81
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,274
That sounds

82
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,516
pretty morally upstanding to me.

83
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:09,820
- In fact...
- Really?

84
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:13,588
'cause it didn't stop him from having
regular sex with me for five years.

85
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,383
But you could have
gotten rid of him.

86
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,010
Wash that man right out of your hair.
End of problem.

87
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,166
Have you ever thought about being
the dumper instead of the dumpee?

88
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,331
That's not a bad idea.
Why don't you practice on me?

89
00:11:23,456 --> 00:11:24,935
- Start right now.
- Oh, my god!

90
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,810
She has a ring.
Look.

91
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:30,398
Look at her finger. Do you see
that monstrosity on her finger?

92
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,223
They're fucking engaged!

93
00:11:36,198 --> 00:11:38,728
- What is my move here?
- Nothing. There is no move.

94
00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:40,744
- I have to go and say hi?
- No! Fuck, no.

95
00:11:40,869 --> 00:11:42,868
- You don't.
- But that's what normal people do.

96
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,094
Jill, you've got to get out of
your own away.

97
00:11:45,219 --> 00:11:48,165
The only thought in your head right
now should be,"fuck that guy."

98
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,252
I'm really starting to think that's
the only piece of advice you have.

99
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:54,772
This is what you should do.

100
00:11:55,126 --> 00:11:56,381
What are you doing?

101
00:11:57,237 --> 00:11:59,259
Oh, my god, Moody.
Moody.

102
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,764
Oh, my god, it is you.

103
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:06,224
Yeah, it's me, buddy.
Kind of busy here.

104
00:12:06,824 --> 00:12:10,472
Sorry for having the nerve to come up
and say hi in public. Don't blow me off.

105
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:14,097
I just wanted you to know that I got
the test results back.

106
00:12:15,232 --> 00:12:18,612
Shit, I hope you have the courage to
inform the rest of your sexual partners,

107
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,281
because lord knows I never had
the herp before you blew me

108
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,559
until I was shooting blood
at the Palm Springs white party.

109
00:12:24,684 --> 00:12:25,494
Whatever.

110
00:12:26,118 --> 00:12:30,122
I hope you and your beard have
a wonderful rest of the day.

111
00:12:41,702 --> 00:12:44,525
Can I just tell you
that being incredibly sweet

112
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,782
and sensitive
to my situation right now

113
00:12:46,907 --> 00:12:49,648
is not making me
want to fuck you any less.

114
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:52,242
Let's go, baby.

115
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:54,104
Okay, so here's the thing.

116
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:03,874
He's my life, Charlie.
He's my first client.

117
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:06,395
I can't lose him.
I am fucked if I lose him.

118
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,911
Let me handle this for you.

119
00:13:12,404 --> 00:13:14,354
Knock, knock. Runkle calling.

120
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:16,996
How you doing there?

121
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,797
Hello, hello.
I'm Charlie Runkle and...

122
00:13:20,928 --> 00:13:22,486
Are you the law?

123
00:13:23,946 --> 00:13:25,496
Or are you an outlaw?

124
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:27,889
'cause there's only one I can abide.

125
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:34,567
No harm, man.

126
00:13:36,313 --> 00:13:37,513
Come in peace.

127
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:42,154
I owe you an apology.

128
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,278
Don't do this.

129
00:13:43,403 --> 00:13:46,366
Just get your head out of your ass,
and you don't have to apologize.

130
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,300
- Come on, Sue, you know I love you.
- Then why change?

131
00:13:49,425 --> 00:13:52,769
It's not about chasing
some shiny Hollywood dream.

132
00:13:54,295 --> 00:13:58,195
I've snorted, fucked, and smoked
everything Hollywood has to offer.

133
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,240
It's about my legacy.

134
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:07,950
These young bulldogs from UTK
came up nipping at my heels,

135
00:14:08,075 --> 00:14:11,228
saying they could put my face
on a salad-dressing bottle

136
00:14:11,353 --> 00:14:13,303
and sell million for chary...

137
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,480
Paul Newman-type shit.

138
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,884
Shit is extltly what it is.

139
00:14:18,147 --> 00:14:21,893
UTK gis s that speech
to every potential client over 50.

140
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:25,118
It's how they poach boomers,
by preying on idealism

141
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:27,532
Who the fuck are you?

142
00:14:27,969 --> 00:14:29,981
I am Charlie Runkle.

143
00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:31,828
Call me Chuck.

144
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,541
Look, what thewawant to do is turn you
in a corporate brand, man.

145
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:38,081
Forget Paul Newman.

146
00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:40,594
UTK is more likely to put
your name on a McDonalds' cup.

147
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:43,179
- Sue here is the one...
- Stop the vomit.

148
00:14:46,138 --> 00:14:47,238
Listen, Sue.

149
00:14:48,114 --> 00:14:51,983
Did you bring me one of those
MBA twerps, or is this guy a man?

150
00:14:53,586 --> 00:14:54,636
He's a man.

151
00:14:56,454 --> 00:14:58,904
Well, then let's settle this
like men.

152
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,778
- You want me to fight you?
- You lick me,

153
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,158
I go with her.

154
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:15,922
I lick you,

155
00:15:16,413 --> 00:15:18,507
you will leave the premises.

156
00:15:19,122 --> 00:15:20,522
All right, Runkle.

157
00:15:22,614 --> 00:15:23,614
Pound him!

158
00:15:24,463 --> 00:15:26,258
I'm not gonna hit an old man.

159
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,343
I heard that, pantywaist.

160
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:31,088
Forget to take
your pamprin this morning?

161
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,088
Okay, then.

162
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,071
How do you propose we do this, huh?

163
00:15:41,196 --> 00:15:42,857
We're gonna do it tiger style?

164
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,825
Or do you like the spider?

165
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,322
Come on.

166
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,574
Sue is Sue!

167
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,237
She believes in people, not brands.

168
00:15:53,362 --> 00:15:55,332
She had your back
when you were living in her van.

169
00:15:55,457 --> 00:15:57,003
She'll have it till the day you die!

170
00:15:57,128 --> 00:15:58,893
That's my fucking bad nipple!

171
00:16:01,777 --> 00:16:03,545
You want your face
on some salad dressing,

172
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,506
Sue will get you
some motherfucking salad dressing.

173
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,569
My goddamn sciatica.

174
00:16:13,694 --> 00:16:15,644
Fuck the whimpering dog pack!

175
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,650
Go with the lioness!

176
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,646
I'm in.
Get the fuck off me.

177
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,150
Runkle.

178
00:16:26,508 --> 00:16:27,658
Come on, you.

179
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,742
You almost gave me
a heart attack, you old bear.

180
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,564
Oh, Susie, you know
I never would have left you.

181
00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:40,466
I didn't want to sign
with those UTK guys.

182
00:16:40,804 --> 00:16:44,656
They're the laugh of the town with that
agent that's masturbating all the time.

183
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:46,431
Yeah. Tell me about it.

184
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,447
That place is unsavory.

185
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,020
Professor Moody.
You shouldn't have.

186
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,102
- Can I come in?
- Not the best of times, actually.

187
00:17:17,305 --> 00:17:20,193
I have some important things to discuss,
weighty things...

188
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:22,999
Stuff I'd like to get off my chest.

189
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:26,753
By all means. Then.

190
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,981
I really do have a meeting.

191
00:17:34,873 --> 00:17:37,244
So look, here's the thing...
No. No, no.

192
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:38,669
This is yummier.

193
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,508
You're quitting.
I know.

194
00:17:41,821 --> 00:17:44,314
You're moving back to New York,
aren't you?

195
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,314
You and Kelly are going to give it
another go.

196
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,365
- Karen.
- Whatever.

197
00:17:48,654 --> 00:17:50,506
The point is,
I assumed you'd be moving back.

198
00:17:50,631 --> 00:17:53,196
Not to worry, we'll be fine.
Life goes on.

199
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:56,286
I'm sure I could just cruise
by home depot

200
00:17:56,411 --> 00:17:59,035
and find someone
more suitable for the job.

201
00:18:02,774 --> 00:18:05,096
You can't say
we didn't give it a shot, right?

202
00:18:05,722 --> 00:18:07,784
We gave it the old college try,
didn't we?

203
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:09,109
Did you, Hank?

204
00:18:09,726 --> 00:18:12,976
- I like to think so.
- That's all that matters, then.

205
00:18:13,523 --> 00:18:15,844
You seem rather annoyed with me.

206
00:18:16,931 --> 00:18:18,680
Ah, it's all for the best, really.

207
00:18:18,943 --> 00:18:20,443
What's for the best?

208
00:18:20,727 --> 00:18:23,537
Well, seeing as though I made
a an absolute fool out of myself,

209
00:18:23,662 --> 00:18:26,392
I can't say that I'm entirely sad
to see you go.

210
00:18:26,517 --> 00:18:28,767
No, it's true, really.
You know...

211
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,985
I offered myself to you,
and you weren't interested.

212
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:34,175
Felicia, that's not exactly
how it went down.

213
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,824
You have some serious relationship
issues a attend to, as do I.

214
00:18:38,245 --> 00:18:40,933
And the most that we could have
offered each other is some...

215
00:18:41,058 --> 00:18:42,408
Sexual healing...

216
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:44,677
Pleasures of the flesh
and whatnot, that's all.

217
00:18:44,802 --> 00:18:46,750
But that's exactly
what I was looking for.

218
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,779
- No, no. You say that, but...
- No, it is.

219
00:18:49,904 --> 00:18:52,112
After a while, I would work my way
under your skin

220
00:18:52,237 --> 00:18:54,568
like the slow-moving fungus
that I am.

221
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:57,093
And you... I've always
been a sucker for a woman

222
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,096
who's a boy on my arm
and a puma in the bedroom.

223
00:19:01,147 --> 00:19:03,347
If only I could have
just had one little nibble.

224
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,811
- It's not enough. We both know that.
- It's all for the rest.

225
00:19:07,295 --> 00:19:09,522
So we'reooool?
Yes, we're cool.

226
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:13,469
That's my meeting.

227
00:19:13,714 --> 00:19:16,529
You know what? You can go out
this door if you'd like...

228
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,957
My car is right out front,
so why don't I just...

229
00:19:19,082 --> 00:19:20,834
Oh, of course.
I'll see you out.

230
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:22,368
Wait, wait.

231
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:24,821
David.

232
00:19:26,482 --> 00:19:28,030
- Come in.
- You look good.

233
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:31,121
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I early?
Am I interrupting something?

234
00:19:31,246 --> 00:19:32,879
- Not at all.
- Yeah, he kind is...

235
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:35,048
Nonsense. Professor Moody
was just leaving.

236
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:38,092
Hank Moody...
David Wilder. Big fan.

237
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,720
David's another
of our notorious writers

238
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,640
- at the university.
- Yeah, <i>the Hardest of Woods.</i> I'm aware.

239
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,039
Before you came along,

240
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:48,436
I was in a fair amount of trouble with
this one for bedding the local talent.

241
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,438
So thank you
for taking the pressure off me.

242
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,956
You're welcome...

243
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:53,081
I guess.

244
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:56,361
Yeah, it's given me hell of
a lot of time

245
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,906
to work on my writing, which is nice,
'cause I like to sit at my desk,

246
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,909
and I like to brew up
a big mug of word tea.

247
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,410
Word tea?
Sure.

248
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,496
You should probably go.
We have work to discuss.

249
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,598
Where exactly is...

250
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:10,973
his royal deanness this evening?

251
00:20:11,098 --> 00:20:14,898
Oh, he's out with friends,
re-creating the battle of Chickamauga.

252
00:20:15,683 --> 00:20:17,391
That's interesting.
Very interesting.

253
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,300
No, it's not, actually.
It's dull as shit.

254
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:23,063
You're doing it? You're cashing in
your freebie, your marital hall pass.

255
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,640
- What you're talking about.
- You're gonna stick it to the deaner

256
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,476
by letting Wilder here
show you his hardest of woods.

257
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,823
- I beg your pardon.
- Buddy, that is completely out of line.

258
00:20:31,948 --> 00:20:33,731
Don't do it.
Don't throw it all away

259
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,535
for a few clumsy minutes with
the poor man's version of me,

260
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,389
the road-show version of me.

261
00:20:38,514 --> 00:20:41,219
You know what? Bragging's not my thing,
but I can go for hours.

262
00:20:41,344 --> 00:20:43,795
Stay and watch. Be my guest.
Maybe she'll take us both on.

263
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,702
Hank, this is none of your business.

264
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,371
Even if I was cashing
something in or whatever...

265
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,089
Felicia, don't do it.

266
00:20:50,578 --> 00:20:53,749
Don't chuck it all for the fucking
nutty professor here. This is bullshit.

267
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:56,796
You know what? That is uncalled for.
And we both know that I'm not black.

268
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:00,455
When was the last time, by the way,
that you published anything, Moody?

269
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,320
You know what?
Easy for you to say.

270
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,846
You have no...
You just got back with your ex-whatever,

271
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,140
just as things were starting
to heat up between us.

272
00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:01,559
You're my student

273
00:00:01,822 --> 00:00:04,128
Not anymore, I'm not.

274
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:05,737
This is so not fair.

275
00:00:06,215 --> 00:00:07,873
<i>Previously on</i> Californication...

276
00:00:07,998 --> 00:00:10,635
I've never stepped outside
of my marriage before.

277
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:13,596
Who in their right minds would
step out on his royal deanness?

278
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,598
I am flattered, but I...

279
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:21,487
And I'm wet.

280
00:00:22,182 --> 00:00:24,523
Hard and wet...
That's a winning combination.

281
00:00:30,888 --> 00:00:32,740
What?
Not even a hello.

282
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,493
What, were you just
gonna leave me behind?

283
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,244
We just pack up and leave L.A.?

284
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,455
The three of us move back
to New York together?

285
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,082
Yeah, end of the semester.

286
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,292
For the first time in my life,
I'm actually happy,

287
00:00:43,474 --> 00:00:45,294
now I must move someplace
I have no friends?

288
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,089
- What was your name again?
- She didn't. Next.

289
00:00:50,632 --> 00:00:52,032
Runkle is ankling!

290
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,972
Rick fucking Springfield
is here in my house

291
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,182
right fucking now?

292
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,185
'80s pop legend Rick Springfield
is in there stealing your girl.

293
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,771
You have to out-fuck
Rick Springfield.

294
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,933
The only time I ever
made Marcy squeal like that

295
00:01:06,058 --> 00:01:07,692
was when I put
the ring on her finger.

296
00:01:10,844 --> 00:01:12,974
Destroy me, Rick Springfield!

297
00:01:14,683 --> 00:01:16,317
Christ on the cross, Hank.

298
00:01:16,442 --> 00:01:19,195
- My lungs are about to explode.
- You didn't have to come.

299
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,748
You could have stayed home and made
the fucky-fucky with the boss lady.

300
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,227
Hey! Laugh all you want.
How many people can say

301
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:27,521
they've been in the same
honey pot as Jack Nicholson?

302
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:29,547
How many people
in the L.A. phone book?

303
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,265
Ah, who am I kidding?

304
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:33,784
I used to be Charlie Runkle.

305
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:34,909
Now...

306
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:37,240
I'm Runkle!

307
00:01:39,124 --> 00:01:41,697
Look at us, Runkle.
L.A. has made us soft.

308
00:01:41,822 --> 00:01:45,418
You were able to run for the Lexington
avenue express with the best of them,

309
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,762
elbowing investment wankers
out of the way.

310
00:01:47,887 --> 00:01:50,338
Your cell phone in one hand,
your mammoth ball sack in the other,

311
00:01:50,463 --> 00:01:52,153
a Hollywood reporter
between your teeth,

312
00:01:52,451 --> 00:01:55,805
not even breathing so you wouldn't
inhale the fucking piss stench.

313
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,720
Jesus christ, we're out here
'cause of Karen, aren't we?

314
00:01:58,845 --> 00:01:59,922
That's right.

315
00:02:00,047 --> 00:02:03,122
The gods have seen fit to give me
another shot with the soul mate.

316
00:02:03,818 --> 00:02:06,569
She's in New York, feathering the nest,
and I got to be ready for her,

317
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:07,744
mentally...

318
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:09,243
physically...

319
00:02:09,615 --> 00:02:10,615
sexually.

320
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,924
Maybe it's time to stop banging
the entire college campus.

321
00:02:14,198 --> 00:02:16,541
Right you are, motherfucker.

322
00:02:17,215 --> 00:02:18,415
Right as rain.

323
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:21,265
It's time for me to grow up,
do the right thing.

324
00:02:22,144 --> 00:02:23,684
Easier said than done, though, huh?

325
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:26,096
Jackie's 23.

326
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:28,661
She's not looking to make
those breasteses exclusive.

327
00:02:28,786 --> 00:02:30,592
And Jill, she knows
I got a snip and a baby.

328
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:34,058
And Felicia,
I'm just a daydream to her...

329
00:02:34,183 --> 00:02:35,889
An escape hatch from the deanery.

330
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:37,714
Shit, I can get this done
in one day...

331
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:41,584
Breakfast, lunch, dinner, then home
for some cybersex with the soul mate.

332
00:02:42,115 --> 00:02:43,511
That's not a bad idea.

333
00:02:43,752 --> 00:02:45,648
You kidding?
It's a terrible idea.

334
00:02:45,773 --> 00:02:47,243
The lighting is subpar,

335
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:50,537
very difficult to properly
showcase one's dangling majesty.

336
00:02:50,662 --> 00:02:52,171
But it sure beats phone-ilingus.

337
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,816


338
00:03:40,023 --> 00:03:41,807
You wanted to see me,
professor Moody?

339
00:03:41,932 --> 00:03:43,752
Jackie, my prized pupil.

340
00:03:43,877 --> 00:03:46,517
Come on in.
Have a seat and shut the door. Or wait.

341
00:03:46,766 --> 00:03:49,728
Don't shut the door.
I don't know. What do you think?

342
00:03:50,454 --> 00:03:53,092
Well, I think you're more of
a thrill-seeker than I thought

343
00:03:53,217 --> 00:03:55,067
if you want to fuck me
with the door open.

344
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,901
I know. You know, I think,
as you got to know me,

345
00:03:58,026 --> 00:04:01,365
you'd find that I was pretty much of
a fuddy-duddy, just an old-fashioned...

346
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,701
Yeah, I actually wanted
to talk to you about that.

347
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,991
I think that we need to spice
things up a little bit.

348
00:04:06,116 --> 00:04:08,752
I'm getting sort of tired
of being on top all the time.

349
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,591
Don't knock cowgirl.
That's my favorite "posish. "

350
00:04:12,716 --> 00:04:14,628
I do some of my best work
from the bottom.

351
00:04:14,886 --> 00:04:16,284
- You know why?
- Why?

352
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:19,150
I got my hands free.
It's like sexual bluetooth.

353
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,167
I missed you.
It's been a while.

354
00:04:23,862 --> 00:04:26,063
- About that...
- Did you miss me?

355
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,120
Sure I did,

356
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:29,602
tons.

357
00:04:31,996 --> 00:04:33,731
- Look, here's the thing.
- Oh, my god.

358
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,004
Seriously?

359
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,194
- You're trying to end this thing.
- A thing, is it?

360
00:04:39,794 --> 00:04:42,609
Well, it sounds to me
like you're dumping me.

361
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:45,242
That's harsh
when you put it that way,

362
00:04:45,802 --> 00:04:47,828
but that's exactly right,
in a manner of speaking.

363
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,144
You're a lovely girl,

364
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:52,379
- the loveliest of the loveliest.
- This is because of that woman?

365
00:04:52,642 --> 00:04:54,620
Who was in class the other day...

366
00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:55,961
Your old lady.

367
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:57,796
That's the woman what done it, yes.

368
00:05:00,163 --> 00:05:03,093
- You're back with her now?
- She is the mother of my child.

369
00:05:03,662 --> 00:05:06,788
Oh, and she doesn't mind you
sleeping with students

370
00:05:06,913 --> 00:05:09,242
who aren't very much older
than that child?

371
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:11,355
Well, that is... low.

372
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,450
Oh, coming from the guy
who loved my work

373
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:18,176
and found me oh-so-talented,
but now has grown tired of fucking me.

374
00:05:18,662 --> 00:05:22,029
- Really? Have I made you feel that way?
- It's cool. Don't sweat it.

375
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:24,738
It's not like it was serious, right?

376
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:25,950
Just fun?

377
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:28,059
Fun it was.

378
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,561
Besides, I'm a sex worker, right?

379
00:05:31,103 --> 00:05:33,854
- What does that mean?
- Don't worry about me.

380
00:05:34,422 --> 00:05:38,207
I can't get hurt.
I'm just a hot piece of stripper ass.

381
00:05:38,332 --> 00:05:40,255
You have your fun with me,
and then you're done.

382
00:05:40,586 --> 00:05:43,968
- I got it, loud and clear.
- Don't like the way that sounds.

383
00:05:44,221 --> 00:05:46,053
Maybe I don't like the way it feels.

384
00:05:46,923 --> 00:05:48,323
Jackie, I'm sorry.

385
00:05:48,483 --> 00:05:49,483
Sorry.

386
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,308
I'm sorry.
I am so,

387
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,245
so sorry.

388
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,566
No need to make a fuss.

389
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,622
We can handle this like adults.

390
00:05:59,747 --> 00:06:01,443
In fact, since I'm...

391
00:06:02,232 --> 00:06:03,382
Right here...

392
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,824
Why not just blow you one more time?

393
00:06:10,548 --> 00:06:13,330
- No, that's really not necessary.
- Oh, come on,

394
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,041
just let the sex worker
do what the sex worker does best.

395
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,403
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,
what is going on here?

396
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,926
- This is so not what it seems.
- I knew it.

397
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,555
I knew you were a depraved lunatic.

398
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,597
That may very well be the case,

399
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,629
but things are not
always as they appear.

400
00:06:32,754 --> 00:06:34,566
Good god, man, your fly is open.

401
00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:38,272
Thank you for embarrassing me
in front of my student.

402
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,315
What do you have to say
for yourself, Jackie?

403
00:06:41,893 --> 00:06:43,818
Well, he said he'd give me an A.

404
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:46,697
That is some fucked-up shit right there,
woman.

405
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,998
- Reverse course.
- I'll have you drawn and quartered.

406
00:06:49,123 --> 00:06:51,972
Maybe Jackie's gonna want to press
charges against the aging degenerate

407
00:06:52,097 --> 00:06:53,996
who compromised her
college experience.

408
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,228
Maybe I will.

409
00:06:55,353 --> 00:06:57,583
- What the fuck?
- But I can't.

410
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:00,127
Why on earth not?

411
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,643
You know what, Felicia?
It's up to you.

412
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,728
You know I would jump at the opportunity
to make sweet, hard love to you.

413
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:16,388
You have the...
You have the ass of a ten-year-old boy.

414
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:21,237
Hank, please, just go.
It's too little, too late. I can't.

415
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,549
Fine.
You're a big girl.

416
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,755
You can make your own decisions.

417
00:21:28,366 --> 00:21:30,996
Be good to her, Wilder.
She's way out of your league.

418
00:21:31,676 --> 00:21:32,873
I concur.

419
00:21:34,277 --> 00:21:36,267
I have a book
coming out this spring.

420
00:21:36,392 --> 00:21:39,172
Do you think maybe
you can write me up a blurb?

421
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,738
What's this one called,
the buoyancy of turds?

422
00:21:41,863 --> 00:21:43,468
Think about it.
I'll send you a copy.

423
00:21:48,451 --> 00:21:49,307
He's drunk.

424
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,385
So how do you want to do this?

425
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:06,192
Do you want to just kick back
and start with a little oral, huh?

426
00:22:06,317 --> 00:22:09,253
Do you want a little bit of this?
Or should I go for a little bit of that?

427
00:22:09,378 --> 00:22:10,811
Because I'll tell you something,

428
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:13,456
I could eat that peach
all night long.

429
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:15,367
I just camp out...

430
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,293
S'mores.

431
00:22:19,307 --> 00:22:22,507
Yeah, I think you'll find that
I'm a very giving and caring lover...

432
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,300
So you don't have to worry...

433
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,231
Fine, I'll do it.

434
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,851
You want to throw your life away,
use me.

435
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,813
What? That's the most
ridiculous thing I've...

436
00:22:32,938 --> 00:22:34,180
Please! Go!

437
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,535
Wilder, go brew yourself
a big mug of word tea...

438
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,220
And dip your balls in it.

439
00:22:53,514 --> 00:22:56,104
<i>Behind the green door</i>
is available on blu-ray.

440
00:22:56,229 --> 00:22:57,279
Laser disc.

441
00:22:58,024 --> 00:23:01,914
People who sold their laser discs
were absolute assholes,

442
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,612
fools and assholes.

443
00:23:05,307 --> 00:23:06,757
- What?
- Flip it.

444
00:23:07,498 --> 00:23:08,498
Flip it!

445
00:23:19,675 --> 00:23:22,233
So where is the man
of the house this evening?

446
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:23,761
Berlin.

447
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:27,519
Think he is bidding
on an egyptian fertility amulet.

448
00:23:27,644 --> 00:23:29,070
It's quite rare, really.

449
00:23:29,195 --> 00:23:32,243
It's the world's first
depiction of a butt plug.

450
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,118
Excellent.
Excellent.

451
00:23:34,243 --> 00:23:35,393
Good for him.

452
00:23:38,441 --> 00:23:40,112
I must toast you.

453
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,838
- What you did today was astonishing.
- Thank you, Sue.

454
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:45,977
When you started, I thought,

455
00:23:46,102 --> 00:23:48,286
"my god, this man
has diarrhea of the mouth

456
00:23:48,411 --> 00:23:50,470
and there is no kaopectate
in sight. "

457
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,622
But the poetry...

458
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,047
that poured out of you...

459
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:57,810
I mean, you cast your rod,

460
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:01,978
and you hooked the old swordfish,
and you reeled him in by his taint.

461
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:06,277
To Charles W. Runkle, my hero.

462
00:24:08,235 --> 00:24:09,870
To you, Sue.

463
00:24:18,763 --> 00:24:21,545
- Well, look at that.
- So let's get this party started!

464
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:23,336
Toot?

465
00:24:26,575 --> 00:24:27,423
Why not?

466
00:24:31,987 --> 00:24:33,566
That's a nice coke straw.

467
00:24:33,691 --> 00:24:34,791
Very classy.

468
00:24:35,795 --> 00:24:38,559
It was given to me by a female
member of Fleetwood Mac.

469
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:43,606
Stevie Nicks?

470
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,310
Oh, I can't say.

471
00:24:45,435 --> 00:24:49,445
But it wasn't Christine McVie
or Lindsey Buckingham.

472
00:24:49,916 --> 00:24:52,266
- Yeah, Lindsey's a dude.
- Exactly.

473
00:24:55,176 --> 00:24:57,453
I have a deviated septum.

474
00:24:58,433 --> 00:25:00,289
You really shouldn't touch
this stuff at all.

475
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,357
You know, that really burns.

476
00:25:03,117 --> 00:25:05,128
I want you to do me a solid, Runkle.

477
00:25:05,951 --> 00:25:09,230
I need you to blow this up my bum...

478
00:25:09,431 --> 00:25:11,928
You know, a tush toot.

479
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:15,012
The old coke in the can, huh?

480
00:25:17,658 --> 00:25:18,658
No biggie.

481
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,037
Heh, no, it's no biggie...

482
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:23,788
No biggie at all.

483
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:33,655
Got anything a little longer?
We'll use this.

484
00:25:38,182 --> 00:25:40,913
Not so fast. Where you going
on a school night, young lady?

485
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,673
Actually, I was hoping
we could go grab some ice cream,

486
00:25:44,983 --> 00:25:47,566
make those coldstone guys
work for their tips.

487
00:25:47,691 --> 00:25:48,671
Really?

488
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:50,559
What, like me and you?

489
00:25:50,737 --> 00:25:51,737
Together?

490
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:55,034
Like father and daughter,
almost, together?

491
00:25:55,325 --> 00:25:57,722
To the stone that is cold, together?

492
00:25:58,292 --> 00:25:59,392
That's cool.

493
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:01,867
What the fuck?

494
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,735
You're not gonna "Mr. Hank"
your way out of this one, Chelsea.

495
00:26:11,796 --> 00:26:14,896
- Becca said you'd be gone.
- Dad, can you please be cool?

496
00:26:15,412 --> 00:26:16,412
Be cool?

497
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:20,300
I don't know how much spunk this kid
has deposited all over your bedroom!

498
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,011
Okay, that was unsavory.

499
00:26:23,136 --> 00:26:24,870
But it had to be said.
Now, time to go!

500
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:29,879
Come on, Chelsea.

501
00:26:31,769 --> 00:26:33,966
- You're limping?
- Yes, I went jogging this morning,

502
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,843
Chelsea, okay?
Now go.

503
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,407
You're not interested
in what I'm doing.

504
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,557
Is this really how you want
to spend your school nights?

505
00:26:41,994 --> 00:26:43,867
I wasn't doing anything wrong.

506
00:26:43,992 --> 00:26:45,519
You weren't doing anything wrong?

507
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:49,600
You invited your friends over to fuck in
your bedroom while you waited outside.

508
00:26:49,725 --> 00:26:51,234
That is disgusting.

509
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:54,278
And that's hilarious,
coming from you and all.

510
00:26:54,403 --> 00:26:56,403
What?
I don't understand you.

511
00:26:56,979 --> 00:27:00,534
What the fuck are you thinking?
Do you think this house is a bordello?

512
00:27:05,227 --> 00:27:06,377
Okay, look...

513
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:08,815
- Here's the thing.
- Actually, dad, yes.

514
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,046
This house is a bordello,
because that's how it's run by you!

515
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,340
Now, don't you try to turn
this around on me.

516
00:27:14,704 --> 00:27:16,425
Becca!
Don't go out that door!

517
00:27:17,288 --> 00:27:19,160
Might as well live
whatever life I have left

518
00:27:19,285 --> 00:27:21,405
before you ship me off to New York!
