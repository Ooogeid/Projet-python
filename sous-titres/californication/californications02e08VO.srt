1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,530
I'll make you a deal. You guys stop
playing, and I'll accept jesus...

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,010
as my personal savior.

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,900
Who the fuck are you?

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,990
My bad. You guys keep livin' the dream.

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:26,760
* There's a place for us
where love has no shame *

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,320
* it's not about the years *

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:36,730
* it's about the tears
and when I look for grace *

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:42,960
* your face is that place *

9
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:49,070
* your face is that place *

10
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,410
* your face is that place *

11
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,290
For once, I believe you
actually wrote something.

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,110
And I also believe that you should honestly
consider never writing anything ever again.

13
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,350
Thanks, but I'm not interested
in the opinion of someone

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,740
whose cultural significance
went out with hammer pants.

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,350
Don't knock hammer pants.
They let a man move.

16
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,410
What did you think, baby?

17
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,770
I love it. It's as though, uh,
janis and alanis had a baby.

18
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,970
Yeah, and they put it a dumpster to
howl away its pathetic little existence.

19
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,780
I'm gonna be thinking
about that all day.

20
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,200
And you can think about this.

21
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,010
And you, hankie, can think about this!

22
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,230
Yeah.

23
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,170
Hey, ashby. I just
have one thing to say.

24
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,870
Your face is that place

25
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,740
look, I don't want to
break the girl's heart,

26
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,660
but I can't take any more power
ballads. Suggestions? Please.

27
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,120
Extricate yourself
immediately, if not sooner.

28
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,690
But, jesus, she fucks like
she knows things, you know?

29
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,370
Like she's been places, seen some shit.

30
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,270
Hey, wait, wait, wait! How did
the interview with my old lady go?

31
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,130
It went.

32
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,730
Yeah? What did, uh... what did she
say about me? She misses me, right?

33
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,670
I-I mean, at least in the sack.

34
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,010
Well, I'll know more
when I see her again.

35
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,930
Moody, I thought this
thing was, uh, over.

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,980
I'm going over there right
now after I douche my ears.

37
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,010
Well, go then. Enjoy.

38
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,810
You touch her, I will cut your
cheeks with a straight razor.

42
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,750
That is bullshit.

43
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,320
He's just being dramatic.

44
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,580
I don't mean as much to him
as he'd have you believe.

45
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,220
I don't know, lady.

46
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,320
To hear him tell it, you're
the one that got away.

47
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,400
Ran away screaming is more like it.

48
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,350
What was he like back then?

49
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,880
Mm, I guess probably
the same as he is now --

50
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,330
a lost boy.

51
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,240
Sweet, well-intentioned, loves
the women... A little too much.

52
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,150
What makes him so good,
then? What do you think?

53
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,560
You know what? He listens.

54
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,100
He hears things in a
song that no one else can.

55
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,380
So, what was the last straw?

56
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,450
None of your business.

57
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:00,360
Janie jones, I do believe the
man is still in love with you.

58
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,580
His sun rises and sets with you.

59
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,550
I think that he would toss everything
he's got just to get another shot with you.

60
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,040
That's what i believe.

61
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,590
You know what?We were in the middle
of living our happily-ever-after

62
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,990
when I walked in on him one day writing
a song with a sheryl crow wannabe.

63
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,910
And I don't know. I just freaked out.

64
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,190
I mean, it was more
intimate than fucking.

65
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,840
And I know he always said that he had to
fall in love with everyone he worked with.

66
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,810
He had to open himself up to the music.

67
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,330
But I guess I just...

68
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,050
got sick of sharing him.

69
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,840
So I bailed. Does that
make me superficial?

70
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,200
No. Just human.

71
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,430
Well, look at this. It looks like you
got the happily-ever-after after all.

72
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,120
Damn straight.

73
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,350
Don't you want to talk to
him? Just out of curiosity.

74
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,060
Don't you miss him a little bit?

75
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,860
Oh, yeah. Sure. I miss him.

76
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,280
Like you'd miss a bad case of the crabs if you
got them from robert plant or jesus or someone.

77
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,920
Oh, yeah. Yeah. This is a
little-known fact about jesus --

78
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,710
he was well known for his V.D.

79
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,260
He made the ladies itch all the
way from galilee to nazareth.

80
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,560
You're just like him.

81
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,750
Jesus? You know, I get that a lot.

82
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,180
- You do?
- Yeah.

83
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,690
Let's see if you can walk on water.

84
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,680
Save my words!

85
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,020
Oh, what are you, a child?

86
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,140
What are you, a grown-up?

87
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,030
You ruined a perfectly
good glass of scotch.

88
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,280
Get back in here. The water's warm.

89
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,770
And I believe we should do a
little synchronized swimming.

90
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,290
No, I think that's enough for one day.

91
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,480
I have revealed way more
than I thought I should.

92
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,910
How'd you'd do that?

93
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,720
It's what I do. It's a gift.

94
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,250
Janie!

95
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,160
- What is that -- the
balls and chain? - Yeah.

96
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,630
This does not look good. Come here.

97
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,430
- Janie, where the fuck are you?
- Come on. Come on.

98
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,340
Hold on. Hold on.

99
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:55,400
Just, uh... just wait in here
for a few minutes. I'll be back.

100
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,090
I want you to take her
directly to the airport, okay?

101
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,760
Whatever's on the meter
when you get there,

102
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,950
I will triple it if you see to it
she makes it to the security line.

103
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,900
Don't worry, daddy. I'll be a good girl.

104
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,690
It's really hard for me to
trust you right now, baby.

105
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,930
I know.

106
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,280
My dirty little whore of a nose
is sorry that she let you down.

107
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:22,220
But she loves you so much she's
willing to go chill out at her mother'S.

108
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,820
I've never seen you go voluntarily
to your mother's before.

109
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,960
I want to fix this, charlie.

110
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,840
And if it means shacking up with
that troll, that's what I'm gonna do.

111
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,030
- Let's go.
- Why?

112
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,430
- Come on. Come on.
- What are you doing?

113
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,920
I should drive you.

114
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,760
No. You have your meeting.

115
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,170
Well, we'll reschedule.

116
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,460
Baby, I'm a big girl.

117
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,280
You need to stay here and
take care of you and daisy.

118
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,570
I promise we won't have
any fun while you're gone.

119
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,290
We'll be wishing we were at a
retirement community in tucson.

120
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,430
Oh, yeah. Nothing like
pinochle and menopause jokes.

121
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,990
A blur of canes and
walkers. But look for me.

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,390
I'll be the one soliciting
all the grayhairs --

123
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,700
"I'll suck your dick, old man."

124
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,870
Bye, baby.

125
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,880
Put down those shuffleboard sticks.

126
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,800
Marcy's coming to suck your dicks!

127
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,170
Hello?

128
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,390
It's your knight in shining armor.

129
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,910
Your lord? Your pasha?

130
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,670
What's mandarin for "dream
lover"? Mang-mang kin ren?

131
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,350
Probably the opposite of whatever
the word for "mouth rapist" is.

132
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:56,030
Well, I'm not gonna be there to pick
up becca from school today, okay?

133
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,290
I'll explain later.

134
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,880
Oh, I can't wait to hear it.

135
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,170
No, it's actually a very good one.

136
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,470
But right now, I've got to
see a man about a horse, so...

137
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,180
No ba—os.

138
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:34,120
So I used the "sinkos."

139
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,390
Hey, you.

140
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,590
No father-type figure.

141
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,750
No. But knowing your father, he'll probably
be here on saturday or sunday to pick you up.

142
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,560
I don't want to hear
anything bad about him.

143
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,810
Okay.

144
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,790
It's mia.

145
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,700
Don't bother. She's not
driving. She's got other plans.

146
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:09,380
Oh, really? What? Like
"older boyfriend" plans?

147
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,860
Something like that.

148
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,780
I don't do this nearly
as much as you think.

149
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,770
Makes me paranoid.

150
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,810
Paranocio. Yo.

151
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,780
Plus, the old lady, back when I had one, she
didn't approve of me ingesting the substances.

152
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,300
Not that she was above it herself.

153
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,870
Where do you stand on the issue?

154
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,930
Well, that wasn't exactly a
response, but I'll take it.

155
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,640
Hey, uh, how does, uh,
mrs. Jones seem to you?

156
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,580
Uh, is she a good jefa?

157
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,310
Is she contento?

158
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,470
What's going on here?
A language barrier?

159
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,330
Mi vieja es... stick up asso.

160
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:07,050
Uh, hypocrita. El doble standardo.

161
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,280
Ella fumar sino si yo fumar,

162
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,780
ella cortar los cajones grandes. Yes!

163
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,040
You're beautiful when you smile.

164
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:19,140
I wish you did speak english.

165
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:23,150
I have a lot to discuss on the
subject of accidental cunnilingus.

166
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,360
- Why the fuck wouldn't I speak english?
- Oh, hello!

167
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,500
Give a brother a heads-up before he
divulges his entire history with women.

168
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,630
I was enjoying your spanglish
way too much to stop you.

169
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,360
My spanglish is muy bueno.

170
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,360
Rosario!

171
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,390
- Oh, fuck!
- What?

172
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,790
Get out of here. Get
out of here. Go! Go! Go!

173
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,900
- Rosario.
- Oh, shit.

174
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,750
Ro-sari... O.

175
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,430
Mr. Jones.

176
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,910
Well... I was thinking that now might be the
perfect time for one of our performance reviews.

177
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,610
maybe later, when I finish my work?

178
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,020
This is part of your work.

179
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,060
Dios mio.

180
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,640
I'm fairly new to porn myself.

181
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:25,270
Still, let me just say, it's nice to be
in an office occupied by a real executive.

182
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,940
On a couch that's
actually used for sitting.

183
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,730
Love it!

184
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,920
Daisy, you are so funny.

185
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,310
Oh, do the end of "vaginatown."

186
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,790
"She's my sister, my
daughter, my sister...

187
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,520
oh, I'll never figure it
out without a cock in me!"

188
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,050
I didn't realize that
also played comedically.

189
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:51,270
We think that daisy has what
it takes to be an intense girl.

190
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,220
That is great. Just great.

191
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:58,360
But we're fielding offers from a few studios,
so can you tell us what sets intense apart?

192
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,920
Well, daisy will have access to our
marketing and distribution teams.

193
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:07,800
And with that kind of exposure, daisy can name
her price at strip clubs, fan events, tours.

194
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,670
Not to mention merchandising.

195
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,360
Her face will be on the package
of thousands of rubber vaginas.

196
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,300
Great!

197
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,180
Of course, all intense girls
are all at least double d'S.

198
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,420
You don't have a problem
getting implants, do you?

199
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,010
Wait a minute.

200
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,260
I'm no expert, but I consider
myself quite a masturbator.

201
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,200
I've certainly rubbed them out to girls
a lot smaller-chested than daisy here.

202
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,510
Well, that porn does exist.

203
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,120
But it's a niche.

204
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,280
Like shrimping or granny-fucking.

205
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,680
Who says shrimping is niche?

206
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,730
Look, daisy. We love what we see.

207
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,740
We just want to see a
little more of it, right?

208
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,930
I...

209
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,350
fine.Fine, but you got to know that

210
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,500
if my client is even gonna consider
this request, you'd be buying them.

211
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,180
We're not paying for fun bags.

212
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,620
You know, I'm all for a little
affair of the heart, but that dude?

213
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,290
I think you can do a lot better.

214
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,730
It wasn't always that bad.

215
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,240
I fell for him at first. He
was gonna leave his wife for me.

216
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:08,880
Yes.

217
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:14,590
Yeah. And he was gonna pay so my whole family
could go to college or some shit like that.

218
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,690
"Rosario, te amo, muchacha.

219
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,720
Linda, hermosa, bella t?"

220
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,670
No me gusta.

221
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,230
Give me your jeans.

222
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,140
Oh, no, I don't want you
to do a whole load of dark.

223
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,200
I thin-- I'm good.
They're drying.

224
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,960
No, papi. Don't worry.

225
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,130
I just want to see you out of them.

226
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,360
This is wrong on so
many different levels.

227
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,130
When we're done, can you
at least let me mop up?

228
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,500
Oh, my god.

229
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,290
- It's my phone.
- Yeah. Yeah.

230
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,900
Hello?

231
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,880
Mia is dating lew ashby!

232
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,440
I am as surprised as you are.

233
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:21,470
What the fuck?

234
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,400
We are meant to be taking care of her,

235
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,840
not -- not letting her skip school so
that she can sit in the laps of old men.

236
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,060
Hey, you're the one that condoned it.

237
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,790
Are you out of your fucking mind?

238
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,610
Who was the one that said dating an older
man was a "valid life experience"? Quote.

239
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,980
Fuck!

240
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,220
No, not -- you know, I-I
didn't mean it like that.

241
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,530
I believe someone is owed an
apology, and his name is hank.

242
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,040
No. No, because you brought
this man into our lives, okay?

243
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,210
So you can fix it.

244
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,060
I tried to stop it.

245
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:57,350
Look, anyway, I have it on good authority that that
relationship is not long for this world, so relax.

246
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,790
Wait a minute. Hank.

247
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,890
"Hank"? Why are you
saying "hank" like that?

248
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,790
Like what? Like, since when
did you care how I say "hank"?

249
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,720
Why are you so up my ass about
the way I think you say "hank"?

250
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,130
You're fucking
paranoi-- are you stoned?

251
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,910
La vieja?

252
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,920
Fuck you.

253
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,600
La vieja.

254
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,590
I think we should reconsider.

255
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,750
It's a career move.

256
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,650
It's wrong is what it is.

257
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,680
We were fools to agree to surgery.

258
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,180
Thousands of rubber vaginas, charlie.

259
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:38,740
Yeah, to get your face on those vaginas,
you have to undo your very daisy-ness.

260
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,080
Everything in my career
has been leading up to this.

261
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,980
I want to be a star, charlie.

262
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:48,460
The real stars do not
get their boobs done.

263
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,030
The julias, the meryls, the nicoles.

264
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,960
Nicole clitman? She has e'S.

265
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,960
She needs them to distract people
from the rest of her. You don'T.

266
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,050
Come on. Daisy.

267
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,730
You know, don't hide behind silicone.

268
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,050
Be brave enough to be yourself.

269
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,840
You're a real star.

270
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,670
Lew.

271
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,580
Lew!

272
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,140
You're an asshole!

273
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,400
but we haven't even dated.

274
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,640
No, I'm a little too old
for you. You date children.

275
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,250
- Mia.
- Yeah. Mia.

276
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,780
She's 17.

277
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,230
Okay, but to be fair, when I
met her, I thought she was 19.

278
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,270
Not helping, right?

279
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,840
- You're disgusting.
- Okay. Look --

280
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,180
Come on. Don't leave in a huff.

281
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,730
You know, I design houses for a living.

282
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,820
And usually, when someone wants
a giant behemoth like this,

283
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,650
it's because they're
hiding from something.

284
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,220
Which is a good idea for you.

285
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,560
If you ever took the time to look in
the mirror, I mean, just for a second,

286
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,830
you'd see yourself as you really are.

287
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,730
There's a reason why you can
only attract 17-year-olds.

288
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,320
It's because you're pathetic!

289
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,520
Fuck.

290
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,980
Think we'll make it
out of here by sunset?

291
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,750
Yeah. The coast is clear. Come on.

292
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,520
Don't fall again.

293
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,730
- Hey there.
- What the fuck?

294
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,820
Hola.

295
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,270
Who the fuck is this?

296
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,960
I know you from somewhere.

297
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,760
Don't you worry your
pretty little head about it.

298
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,570
Rosario here is my amiga.

299
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,710
And she tells me when she tried called it
quits between you two, you didn't want to stop.

300
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,990
Now, I'm all for the... That's
cool. I'm not one to judge.

301
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,200
But you -- the power relations
are skewed here, you understand?

302
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,560
You got to read your karl marx.
I want you to respect her shit.

303
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,820
- What are you talking about?
- And I don't want to hear that she's been let go.

304
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,110
Because the day I hear about that, that's the
day that your old lady hears about it, comprende?

305
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,730
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me?

306
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,390
- No, fuck you, ron.
- Fuck you, ron.

307
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,390
- Yeah, fuck you, ron.
- Fuck you, ron.

308
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,880
- Yeah, this is over.
- It's over, buddy.

309
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:13,890
If it's any consolation, I think she
got you out of her system. Several times.

310
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,980
Twice in spanish, couple
times in english there.

311
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,630
Dos.

312
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,960
Once in spanglish. An
underrated movie, in my opinion.

313
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,940
Um, what's going on here?

314
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,630
Did you fuck my maid?

315
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,640
No hablo ingleses.

316
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,880
That is unbelievable.

317
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:34,050
Well, you know, I was trying to
make a graceful exit, but apparently,

318
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:38,860
red-faced angry hockey dad likes to keep
baby in a corner and keep his gate locked up.

319
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:44,120
What was I thinking letting the hank moodys and
the lew ashbys of the world back into my life?

320
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:48,570
Well, you were probably thinking you needed
a break from red-faced angry hockey dad.

321
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,940
let me just ask you about rosario.

322
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,340
Can I ask you not to fire
her, if that's too much?

323
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,180
I-I get the feeling she needs the job
and there are mouths to feed, so...

324
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,010
I'm not gonna fire rosario.

325
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,120
If she keeps on keeping house the way
she does, she can keep fucking my husband.

326
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,490
You're some kind of a neat-freak, huh?

327
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,590
Yeah. I'm not an idiot.
I know all about it.

328
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,630
I just don't know that I actually care.

329
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,900
I'm not sure I buy that, janie jones.

330
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,080
Look, I know I'm not
on top of my game here,

331
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:23,470
but I don't want to lose the most
compelling part of my book, so...

332
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,530
I'm sure that lew ashby has plenty of
compelling parts stashed around this entire city.

333
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,830
- No, but you're the key.
- Yeah.

334
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,160
Can we just finish this interview without, you
know, the dip in the pool and the dip in the maid?

335
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:39,080
No. I'm done talking about lew. Go.

336
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:43,720
If you want to see me again,
you just have to ask me out.

337
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,840
Hold that thought.

338
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,140
- What is this stuff? -
Okay. H-here's the deal.

339
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:10,650
See, my 57-second performance in
"vaginatown" was no one-time thing.

340
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,610
You come...

341
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,120
rather quickly.

342
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,320
- You poor baby! -
No, no, no!I'm lucky --

343
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:20,050
lucky to live in an age when
there are various tools available

344
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,070
of which those of my
ilk can avail themselves.

345
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,260
See, there is numbing
cream. That's good stuff.

346
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,760
Uh, extra-thick condoms...

347
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,900
anal beads?

348
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,130
Oh, no. They shouldn't be in this box.

349
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,100
Those puppies make me
come like a fire hose.

350
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:43,110
Okay. You are not gonna need
any of that stuff with me.

351
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,250
W-- hey, what
are you doing?

352
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,340
Look, I can't see you naked yet.

353
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,520
Okay. I'm gonna coach you through this.

354
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,590
Cock control is mainly mental.

355
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,590
So, what is your most
embarrassing teen moment?

356
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,310
High school. State debate championship.

357
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,500
Yeah, I was ahead, and
then I popped a boner.

358
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,190
So just think about that.

359
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,780
No good. I shame-jizz.

360
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:10,440
Okay. I'll just do the yonic pretzel.

361
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,770
What the fuck is a yonic pretzel?

362
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,960
It's like a negative kegel.

363
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,030
A negative what?

364
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,950
Okay. It's just complicated vagina shit.

365
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,350
Every time you think you're
gonna blow, just pinch me.

366
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,400
And then that'll be my
cue to pretzel, okay?

367
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,780
I don't know.

368
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,880
Trust me.

369
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:31,200
You believed in me,
and i believe in you.

370
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,480
I'm gonna get you through this.

371
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,130
- Here.
- Me?Okay.

372
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,550
A little anaesthetic never hurt.

373
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,900
And you're right. I am an asshole.

374
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:57,740
I know.

375
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:02,910
I'm not gonna lie to you and say
that mia is an old soul, but...

376
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,050
she is charming...

377
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,400
witty, and gorgeous.

378
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:12,820
Yes, but she's less
than half your age, lew.

379
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,770
Okay, but by the time charming, witty,
and gorgeous women get to be my age,

380
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,010
they want nothing to do with me.

381
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,770
Okay, so that's your
rationale. That's okay.

382
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,450
No, it's true. Take
yourself, for example.

383
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,480
I mean, you've had your
share of man-children.

384
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,340
Excuse me!

385
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,400
Um, you'd see me coming
a mile away, right?

386
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,640
Man's got a point.

387
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:36,090
But I guess I wouldn't have seen you coming
at 17, which is why we protect our children.

388
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,560
Okay. Okay. The whole age thing's a
real sticking point with you. geez.

389
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,800
Hey, forgive a guy. Can
you just forgive a guy?

390
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:44,720
I mean, surely, there's other older
men that have dated mia, right?

391
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,350
No. Not as far as I know.

392
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,590
And if you did know?

393
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,810
I don't know. If they were like you,
I wouldn't speak with them ever again.

394
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,520
Interesting.

395
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,790
What's interesting?

396
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,730
Well, 'cause we're truth-telling, um...

397
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,860
- what?
- Nothing.

398
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,490
Uh, I... I take women
as they come to me.

399
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,910
- Oh, that's -- - any woman who is kind
enough to have me, I don't question.

400
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,820
That's beautiful. That's
-- that's nice of you, lew.

401
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,290
- I missed a
little bit. - I --

402
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,680
what the fuck?

403
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,260
I thought I saw a green
light there. I did.

404
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,220
- No.
- No, absolutely.

405
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:31,300
- W-what? - I've got
to go. You're insane.

406
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,250
Call me.

407
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,480
Your jedi clam tricks really work.

408
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,170
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I'm really doing it.

409
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,930
Staying in the game.

410
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,960
My penis is still in your vagina.

411
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,740
Way to go, champ!

412
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,830
Holy shit!

413
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,660
I'm king of fuck mountain!

414
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,990
I could go for days!

415
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,760
Oh, well, um, that's
not totally necessary.

416
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,480
Oh, it's no problem.
You just enjoy yourself.

417
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,100
I'm actually a little sore.

418
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,710
That's cool. Coming is my favorite part.

419
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,200
Well, you earned it. Okay.

420
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,990
Go! Go!

421
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,800
Okay, please don't pick
that up. I'm chafing.

422
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,730
Charlie, it's ilene.

423
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,230
Where the hell is my daughter?

424
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,120
She doesn't pick up. She doesn't
call. What the fuck, runkle?

425
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:30,280
She had manners before she married you.

426
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:33,770
Son of a bitch!

427
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:36,850
Hey, it's the littlest of
the moodys. I got some sushi.

428
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,030
Play some guitar hero. What do you say?

429
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,080
- Maybe some other time, dad.
- No, no, no, no, no.

430
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,070
I got the kind with the paper boats.

431
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,700
You love you some paper boats.

432
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,870
I'm meeting damien.

433
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,240
Oh, no.

434
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,110
You know, fuck that harry chapin.

435
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,050
Prophetic bastard -- "cat's
in the cradle." Motherfucker.

436
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,530
I should have picked her up.

437
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,200
Right. Well, it's not her loss.

438
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,850
You know, um, you had your
chance, and now you don't, so...

439
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,060
You want sushi?

440
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,070
No. Uh, would that I could.

441
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,470
I-I have to go meet sonja
and, um, your best friend

442
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,940
- at the gallery at the bergamot.
- Oh, the bearded bozo?

443
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,760
Well, take some with.
I got way too much.

444
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:17,080
- I got... I got like 20 pounds.
- Oh, no. You know, it doesn't travel so well.

445
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,440
- Paper boats.
- Thank you.

446
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:24,060
But you could, you know, just make yourself
at home and -- and -- and lock up after.

447
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:28,410
Well, yeah. This used
to be my home once.

448
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,330
And I used to be your girl once.

449
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,940
- Okay.
- Hey, about, um...

450
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,310
you know, the mia thing with ashby.

451
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,080
I'll take care of it.
I'm gonna protect her.

452
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,420
- It's already taken care of.
- No, no. It's unforgivable.

453
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,320
She's still a kid.

454
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,670
I took care of it.

455
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,110
How? How did you do that?

456
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,160
I mean, the guy's an animal,
a moving train. He's pure id.

457
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:55,490
Yeah, you're right.

458
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,650
but he is a great kisser, so...

459
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,690

what?Wha--

460
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,330
I think you heard me.

461
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,990
I
--

462
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:10,430
So, if you'll excuse me, i have
to go see a man about a horse.
