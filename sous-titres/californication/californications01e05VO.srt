1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,001
You could have done me less moody
if you'd made me into a Moody.

2
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:00,003
I'll make you a Moody right now.

3
00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:00,005
Get on with your life and forget about
the woman you didn't want to marry.

4
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:00,007
- Back to work.
- Yes, sir.

5
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:00,009
Anything you want
to tell me about there, captain?

700:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,011
Please. I'm a married man.
Hey, baby.

6
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:00,013
- My name is Hank.
- I know.

7
00:00:00,014 --> 00:00:00,015
This is Mia, Bill's daughter,
and this is Hank.

8
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:00,017
You two know each other?

9
00:00:00,018 --> 00:00:00,019
- I am 16, you know.
- So I've been told.

10
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:00,021
- My daughter's an angel.
- You poor bastard.

11
00:00:00,022 --> 00:00:00,023
I have a creative-writing course,
and I need to turn something in today.

12
00:00:00,024 --> 00:00:00,025
You must have
some piece-of-shit short story

13
00:00:00,026 --> 00:00:00,027
you never published
around here somewhere.

14
00:00:00,028 --> 00:00:00,029
- Remember me?
- How could I forget?

15
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,031
I think we took things
to a whole other level.

16
00:00:00,032 --> 00:00:00,033
Can I talk to you for a second?

17
00:00:00,034 --> 00:00:00,035
- That's married guy. Come on.
- I didn't know he was gonna be here.

18
00:00:00,036 --> 00:00:00,037
- Let her go.
- What are you talking about?

19
00:00:00,038 --> 00:00:00,039
Fucker!

20
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,041
I'm glad we came.

22
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,600
I'm back,

23
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,925
and you're Black, which is cool.
I'm a big fan of Black Jesus.

24
00:00:25,065 --> 00:00:27,929
High five. Don't leave me hanging.
There you go.

25
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:33,200
- Can I help you, my son?
- Hey, <i>padre</i>.

26
00:00:33,378 --> 00:00:36,294
No, I was just trying to check in
with J.Z. up there.

27
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,257
Anything I can help you with?

28
00:00:39,454 --> 00:00:42,037
Sure you don't have a grab-ass
appointment with an Altar Boy?

29
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:46,122
There's plenty of time for that.

30
00:00:49,837 --> 00:00:51,296
You checking out my package?

31
00:00:52,868 --> 00:00:55,551
You don't want to suck my cock, do you?

32
00:00:56,475 --> 00:00:58,053
Do you want me to suck your cock?

33
00:00:58,678 --> 00:00:59,930
Do you want me

34
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,199
to want you to suck my cock?

35
00:01:04,277 --> 00:01:08,042
- You want to tell me why you're here?
- It's about a girl. She's beautiful.

36
00:01:08,182 --> 00:01:10,190
She's smart and funny,

37
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,318
- up for all kinds of intercourse.
- But she's not Karen.

38
00:01:13,836 --> 00:01:16,363
- I didn't say that.
- Karen doesn't love you, Hank.

39
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:18,991
She loves me.

40
00:01:37,436 --> 00:01:38,759
With a gay priest!

41
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,248
Fuck me.

42
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:46,339
Has anyone ever told you
you have a lot of bad dreams?

43
00:01:47,155 --> 00:01:49,859
What's wrong with Black Jesus
and a gay priest

44
00:01:50,084 --> 00:01:53,034
just looking for a little oral
to get him through his night?

45
00:01:53,985 --> 00:01:55,262
L.O.L.

46
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:57,088
What was that?

47
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,149
What'd you just say just now? L.O.L.?

48
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:03,972
- "Laugh out loud"?
- Yep.

49
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:08,018
That's a part of your lexicon?
Really? L.O.L.?

50
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:10,740
Shouldn't it be part of yours, too?

51
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,232
You are writing
for cyberspace, you know.

52
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,125
And there goes my boner. Wave bye-bye.

53
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:19,737
- What is your issue with "L.O.L."?
- I don't have an issue,

54
00:02:19,877 --> 00:02:22,074
unless you count the fact
that every time you say it,

55
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,051
you're contributing to the death
of the english language.

56
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:28,117
So, let me get this straight.

57
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,285
You're gonna let the fact
that I just said "L.O.L."

58
00:02:31,593 --> 00:02:35,323
get in the way of me giving you
the best b.j. of your life?

59
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:39,029
Not when you put it that way.

60
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:47,803
Yeah, I'm not the biggest fan
of the term "b.j." Either.

61
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:37,504
Baby, don't make me beg.
We haven't had sex

62
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:41,013
since my last period.
You know how fucking horny I get.

63
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:46,889
You can have the ass if you want.

64
00:03:48,152 --> 00:03:49,308
You can keep it.

65
00:03:49,857 --> 00:03:52,176
Last time we tried anal
during the light of day...

66
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:53,992
Not pretty, remember?

67
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:56,774
You used to be all about
the morning sex.

68
00:03:56,914 --> 00:03:59,883
- What's going on with you?
- I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

69
00:04:00,024 --> 00:04:02,612
I'm really stressed out right now, okay?

70
00:04:02,872 --> 00:04:04,656
It's work stuff, really.

71
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,126
I know.

72
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,660
- Pretend I'm paralyzed.
- What?

73
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,593
- Come on. This will be fun.
- You need to shoot some glue.

74
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:16,837
I'll just lay here.
Do what you got to do.

75
00:04:17,063 --> 00:04:18,772
I'll be your vessel.

76
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:27,983
What the fuck are you doing back there?

77
00:04:28,266 --> 00:04:30,223
What? You don't like that?

78
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:32,010
No, I just...

79
00:04:33,037 --> 00:04:36,691
You can't just go send probes
into unexplored territory

80
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:39,388
without any advance warning.
You know what I'm saying?

81
00:04:39,615 --> 00:04:42,652
I was just trying to spice things up
a little bit.

82
00:04:42,912 --> 00:04:44,760
Things haven't been hot enough for you?

83
00:04:44,978 --> 00:04:47,209
It was just a finger up the ass.

84
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:49,618
I could use the littler one.

85
00:04:52,294 --> 00:04:55,916
I've got to get to work, okay?
I'm gonna be late.

86
00:04:58,887 --> 00:05:00,070
Love you.

87
00:05:04,242 --> 00:05:05,594
Fuck off!

88
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,124
"B" to the "I" to the double "l."

89
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:15,340
What's up, my nig nog?

90
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:17,187
I need to talk to you.

91
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:20,036
Well, you should have called.
I wouldn't have answered,

92
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:23,101
but you could've left a message,
which I would have quickly erased.

93
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:26,446
Yeah, this isn't something
I would choose to discuss

94
00:05:26,664 --> 00:05:27,941
over the phone.

95
00:05:28,364 --> 00:05:29,735
This is about Mia.

96
00:05:33,597 --> 00:05:35,497
You're aware
she's in high school, correct?

97
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:37,391
Really? No.

98
00:05:37,531 --> 00:05:40,001
I mean, I-I was thinking
she was older than that...

99
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:43,422
College, grad school maybe,
something like that.

100
00:05:43,682 --> 00:05:46,044
Quit fucking around, Hank.
this is serious.

101
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:47,828
Shit, Bill.

102
00:05:48,645 --> 00:05:51,346
I'm sorry, man. I'm really sorry,

103
00:05:51,606 --> 00:05:54,421
and I... You know, this is just
a fucked-up situation.

104
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:57,352
And it should have never happened,
but nobody's to blame, really.

105
00:05:57,502 --> 00:06:00,080
I mean, I'm glad, in a way,
that you're here,

106
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:03,165
you know, so we can get on
the same page, all right, man?

107
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:05,271
Your turn.

108
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:09,103
What are you talking about?

109
00:06:09,976 --> 00:06:13,078
I don't know. What are you...
It depends. What are you talking about?

110
00:06:13,322 --> 00:06:15,912
Are you stoned or drunk?

111
00:06:16,172 --> 00:06:18,874
What am I talking about?
What am I talking about?

112
00:06:19,134 --> 00:06:21,560
I don't know half the fucking time
what I'm talking about.

113
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,140
I got to ask you a favor, Hank.

114
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:26,623
Fuck. Well, a favor.

115
00:06:26,851 --> 00:06:28,884
Okay, this should be entertaining.

116
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:33,216
I was supposed to be the guest
speaker at Mia's school today,

117
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:34,833
but I have to go out of town.

118
00:06:36,753 --> 00:06:39,756
And this concerns me
how exactly, Willamina?

119
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:43,522
Well, I was hoping that you might
consider stepping in for me.

120
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,414
It's a creative-writing class, and...

121
00:06:46,828 --> 00:06:48,577
I was gonna talk about publishing.

122
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:51,188
You can talk about writing
or not writing

123
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,107
or whatever works.

124
00:06:55,586 --> 00:06:57,605
And what's in it for me?

125
00:06:58,178 --> 00:06:59,229
What do you want?

126
00:07:01,438 --> 00:07:03,001
Call off the wedding.

127
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,952
Anything else?

128
00:07:07,856 --> 00:07:09,761
That's a nice jacket.

129
00:07:23,697 --> 00:07:25,547
You a smoker? There you go.

130
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:29,986
All right, so, at the end of day,

131
00:07:30,246 --> 00:07:33,900
if you can do anything else...
telemarketing,

132
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:37,330
pharmaceutical sales,
or ditch digging,

133
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:41,077
major league umpire... I would
suggest that you do that,

134
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:42,861
because being a writer blows.

135
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,991
It's like having homework every day
for the rest of your life.

136
00:07:47,013 --> 00:07:48,462
Any more questions?

137
00:07:49,213 --> 00:07:50,650
Yikes. Yeah?

138
00:07:51,423 --> 00:07:53,176
- Are you single?
- Of course I am.

139
00:07:53,436 --> 00:07:54,678
Who would have me?

140
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:56,012
I would.

141
00:07:56,623 --> 00:07:59,759
Okay, girls, let's thank Hank
for coming in on such short notice.

142
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:04,604
Cigarette break, everybody. All right.

143
00:08:10,137 --> 00:08:14,610
- Dude, you're a fucking rock star.
- Please. It's an all-girls school.

144
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,957
Anything with a half a cock and one ball
is gonna get a rise out of these kids.

145
00:08:18,116 --> 00:08:20,852
Tell me about it.
Best job I've ever had.

146
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:24,362
- They're very young.
- Oh, say that again...

147
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:26,143
Slower this time.

148
00:08:26,283 --> 00:08:27,971
My... My fleshy T.A.
didn't hear you.

149
00:08:28,111 --> 00:08:30,036
Stop. Laugh it up, funny man,

150
00:08:30,306 --> 00:08:33,215
but you could go to jail
for that shit.

151
00:08:33,355 --> 00:08:35,863
You're acting like it's
a fucking Mommy & Me class.

152
00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:38,763
These girls are right
on the cusp of their womaninity.

153
00:08:39,023 --> 00:08:40,790
What else is out there for guys like us?

154
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,467
- Guys like us?
- I wrote a novel...

155
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:46,335
- Three of them, actually.
- Oh, yeah?

156
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:49,169
They never came out of the drawer,
but I fucking wrote them.

157
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:51,105
I wrote the shit out of them.

158
00:08:51,227 --> 00:08:52,364
So, what do I do?

159
00:08:52,504 --> 00:08:54,983
Write screenplays like
the rest of the fucking herd?

160
00:08:55,146 --> 00:08:59,268
Or do I fight the good fight and promote
an appreciation of great writing?

161
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:01,728
And just fuck the ones
who are just bored

162
00:09:01,982 --> 00:09:04,034
and stupid
enough to spread 'em for you?

163
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:05,790
Speaking of which, Mia

164
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,243
- is a seriously good writer.
- Yeah?

165
00:09:08,553 --> 00:09:11,150
She's written a couple good
short stories, but nothing since.

166
00:09:11,306 --> 00:09:12,418
But they're good.

167
00:09:13,548 --> 00:09:14,628
Who knows?

168
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,619
Maybe I'm grading on a curve
'cause she gives me wood.

169
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,934
Not so much
with the character development.

170
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:23,689
The prose was a little stiff.
She was trying too hard, really.

171
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,191
Right.

172
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:26,990
Van fuckin' Halen.

173
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:30,099
Is there another motive ingress?

174
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,515
- Busted.
- Oh, god, you don't understand.

175
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:49,215
I could've been there for hours.

176
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,511
Poor Hank Moody.

177
00:09:50,689 --> 00:09:52,784
What's the deal with you
and Mr. Chipwich?

178
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:55,379
- Meaning what exactly?
- You know what I mean.

179
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,416
- Does he have carnal knowledge?
- Yeah, that.

180
00:09:57,566 --> 00:09:58,629
Not yet.

181
00:09:59,064 --> 00:10:00,172
Be careful.

182
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:03,110
Says the much-older man
who did sleep with me.

183
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:05,256
- It was an accident.
- Right, there you were,

184
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,078
minding your own business,
walking down

185
00:10:07,218 --> 00:10:09,448
Abbot Kinney
when your dick on me. Oopsie.

186
00:10:09,695 --> 00:10:12,652
What is this? Open-mike night?
Look, just be careful of him

187
00:10:13,158 --> 00:10:14,271
and those of his ilk.

188
00:10:14,411 --> 00:10:16,055
Hank moody,
as I live and breathe,

189
00:10:16,195 --> 00:10:18,408
- are you looking out for me?
- Why wouldn't I?

190
00:10:18,849 --> 00:10:22,067
Aside from the fact that you're mad
as a hatter, you're a good kid.

191
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:26,548
Well, seeing as I can't seem
to get you back in the sack,

192
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:28,439
I guess I'll just
have to settle for him.

193
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:30,580
I'm sure he won't play as hard to get.

194
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,012
Out of the car.

195
00:10:36,245 --> 00:10:37,729
Have a nice day at school, dear.

196
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:39,231
Bye, Hankarella.

197
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:45,028
How do I look?

198
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:47,287
Sweetie, you look great.
But you know what?

199
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,813
It's a guitar lesson.
It's not a fashion show.

200
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:53,161
Mother, rock, fashion...
It's all one world.

201
00:10:53,303 --> 00:10:55,108
Okay, Avril.

202
00:10:55,368 --> 00:10:56,846
- He is cute.
- He is?

203
00:10:57,359 --> 00:10:59,387
- I hadn't noticed.
- I look like a geek.

204
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:00,804
No, you don't.

205
00:11:01,568 --> 00:11:03,392
It's okay. I'll get it.

206
00:11:07,306 --> 00:11:08,334
Ladies.

207
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:09,937
Your shirt.

208
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,768
What?
You're not a fan, are you?

209
00:11:13,177 --> 00:11:14,576
That would make me so sad.

210
00:11:15,013 --> 00:11:17,599
- I think it's cool.
- Well, it's just, you know...

211
00:11:18,036 --> 00:11:19,078
- Becca.
- Yeah.

212
00:11:19,218 --> 00:11:21,166
Right. Sorry about that.

213
00:11:21,288 --> 00:11:22,956
- I wasn't thinking.
- It's okay.

214
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:24,557
She's my youngest student

215
00:11:24,996 --> 00:11:27,848
- and my most promising.
- Oh, she is? Well, that's great.

216
00:11:28,136 --> 00:11:31,409
I probably have some smelly, old
thing in my car somewhere.

217
00:11:31,835 --> 00:11:33,840
Or you could just turn it
inside out.

218
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,793
You know, you could use
the bathroom on...

219
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,067
Or not.

220
00:11:43,282 --> 00:11:45,215
Hey... Dave.

221
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:47,004
Hey, sweetie.

222
00:11:47,598 --> 00:11:49,151
- Better?
- Much.

223
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,102
I liked it better off,
but that's just me.

224
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:53,923
- How you doing?
- Good.

225
00:11:54,192 --> 00:11:55,530
You been practicing?

226
00:12:05,754 --> 00:12:07,203
I'm here with Hank Moody,

227
00:12:07,474 --> 00:12:10,421
author of celebrated underground novels

228
00:12:10,561 --> 00:12:11,905
like <i>South of Heaven,</i>

229
00:12:12,195 --> 00:12:14,750
<i>Seasons in the Abyss,</i>
and most famously,

230
00:12:14,926 --> 00:12:17,449
<i>God Hates Us All.</i>
How are you, Hank?

231
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:20,317
I'm a little under the weather,
but it's good to be here. Thanks.

232
00:12:20,457 --> 00:12:24,061
Some folks have compared
the wait for your next novel

233
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,520
to the decade-plus wait
for the new <i>Guns N' Roses</i> album.

234
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,192
Which one do you think will see
the light of day first?

235
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,928
Well, I certainly hope that I beat
Guns N' Roses to the punch,

236
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:35,314
because I want to get
on Oprah's book club.

237
00:12:35,645 --> 00:12:37,290
I want that sticker
from the book club.

238
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,874
I want to get on that show,
and I want to ask her...

239
00:12:40,981 --> 00:12:43,303
About that scene in <i>Beloved</i>
where she squats and pees.

240
00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:45,205
How many takes did she do?
Was she method?

241
00:12:45,345 --> 00:12:47,607
In all seriousness,
your blog for <i>Hell-A Magazine</i>

242
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:49,892
is prompting a lot of
underground water-cooler talk.

243
00:12:50,033 --> 00:12:51,324
- It's great.
- Thank you,

244
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:54,945
but it's really... It's more like
pissing out of my ass

245
00:12:55,085 --> 00:12:57,114
than anything else.
You know, it's just...

246
00:12:57,334 --> 00:13:00,622
things bother me, and I vent,
I write it down.

247
00:13:01,035 --> 00:13:02,533
What's your latest obsession?

248
00:13:02,673 --> 00:13:05,252
Just the fact that people seem
to be getting dumber and dumber.

249
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:07,686
I mean, we have all this amazing
technology, and yet...

250
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:10,451
computers have turned into basically
four-figure wank machines.

251
00:13:10,803 --> 00:13:13,554
The internet was supposed to
set us free, democratize us, but...

252
00:13:13,694 --> 00:13:17,285
But all it's really given us is
Howard Dean's aborted candidacy and...

253
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,547
24-hour day acces to kiddy porn.

254
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,922
People... They don't write anymore.
They blog.

255
00:13:23,062 --> 00:13:26,655
Instead of talking, they text...
No punctuation, no grammar, L.O.L. this

256
00:13:26,936 --> 00:13:29,178
and l.M.F.A.O. that.
It just seems to me

257
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:31,947
that it's just a bunch of stupid
people pseudo-communicating

258
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:34,354
with a bunch of other stupid people
in a protolanguage

259
00:13:34,494 --> 00:13:37,436
that resembles more what cavemen
used to speak than the king's English.

260
00:13:37,587 --> 00:13:41,434
Yet, you're part of the problem.
You're blogging with the best of them.

261
00:13:41,556 --> 00:13:43,572
Hence my self-loathing,
you know.

262
00:13:44,505 --> 00:13:46,276
Bar chords are tought, I know.

263
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,852
But once you master them,

264
00:13:47,996 --> 00:13:50,812
all the secrets of the rock 'n' roll
universe will be revealed...

265
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
Trust me.

266
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:57,687
Hold on a second.
I have something for you.

267
00:13:57,827 --> 00:13:59,552
- Wait right here, OK?
- You got it.

268
00:14:02,181 --> 00:14:03,382
Hey, how'd it go?

269
00:14:04,849 --> 00:14:06,276
I'm sure you already know this,

270
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,295
but you have
a really sweet kid there.

271
00:14:08,435 --> 00:14:10,272
You know, you're preaching to the choir.

272
00:14:10,412 --> 00:14:11,910
But thanks. it never gets old.

273
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,974
She's really into it, too,
which is really cool to see.

274
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:17,128
Makes my job a pleasure.

275
00:14:17,393 --> 00:14:19,471
Well, she comes by it honestly.

276
00:14:19,611 --> 00:14:22,294
I mean, her dad is really into music...

277
00:14:23,002 --> 00:14:26,733
- and I was in a band once.
- I'd love to hear the stories sometime.

278
00:14:29,877 --> 00:14:30,956
Excuse me.

279
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:35,077
Hello?

280
00:14:35,512 --> 00:14:37,366
Hey, sweetie. How are you?

281
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:40,159
How was the flight?

282
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,352
And the hotel... is it okay?

283
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,416
Hey, yeah, hold on one second.

284
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:47,553
Where'd he go?

285
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:50,169
Breathe, honey. It's okay.
he's just outside.

286
00:14:50,968 --> 00:14:51,929
I got to go.

287
00:14:52,051 --> 00:14:54,204
Um, Becca's just finishing
her guitar lesson.

288
00:14:54,523 --> 00:14:56,178
What the music that you love?

289
00:14:56,318 --> 00:14:58,759
I am a sucker for <i>Radiohead</i>.

290
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:00,758
Got any exciting plans, this week-end?

291
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,108
- Got to rehearse with the band.
- What do you guys sound like?

292
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:06,885
It's like <i>Radiohead</i>.

293
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:08,778
We got a killer bassist.

294
00:15:09,001 --> 00:15:10,133
- Right.
- Yeah.

295
00:15:10,273 --> 00:15:12,106
- All those things.
- All those things.

296
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,544
What's this?

297
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:17,459
I made it for you...
some songs I like.

298
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,401
I thought
you might like them, too.

299
00:15:20,616 --> 00:15:22,508
A mix tape... cd.

300
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,447
No one's made me one of these
in a long time.

301
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,806
Thank you, sweetie.
I will treasure it always.

302
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:32,404
Same time next week?

303
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,179
Look, I don't want
to take sides here,

304
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:47,994
but I want to say, for the record,
categorically, never...

305
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:51,147
never stick a finger up
a grown man's ass without warning.

306
00:15:51,287 --> 00:15:52,408
Don't do it.

307
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:54,437
- Hi.
- Thank you.

308
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:56,428
Write that down.

309
00:15:56,632 --> 00:15:58,603
You know what?
I've been with other guys.

310
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,583
And sometimes a little ass play is not
only welcome, but it's appreciated.

311
00:16:02,723 --> 00:16:05,315
Yes, I understand, but you got to be
gentle with the brown eye.

312
00:16:05,456 --> 00:16:06,987
Mr. Brown eye's
a sensitive man.

313
00:16:07,263 --> 00:16:08,733
Hey, sorry I'm late.

314
00:16:09,822 --> 00:16:11,897
Found a redhead
wandering the parking lot.

315
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,482
- Brought her in for you.
- Sorry I'm late. stuck in traffic.

316
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:19,365
Listening to the radio...
Very entertaining.

317
00:16:19,618 --> 00:16:21,108
- L.O.L.
- Yes.

318
00:16:23,219 --> 00:16:26,123
So, have you been telling her what
an airhead your new girlfriend is?

319
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:29,735
No, I was just about to.

320
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,505
I heard the interview, Hank.

321
00:16:32,914 --> 00:16:35,961
Nothing like being the object of scorn
and derision on public radio.

322
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:38,785
Well, that's the point, right?

323
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:41,842
Because it's public radio.
Who's listening? So...

324
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,500
So, is this why
his relationships don't last?

325
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:48,918
Because the girls can't live up to
some ridiculous fucking gold standard?

326
00:16:49,632 --> 00:16:51,881
What did you do today?
did you get your hair done?

327
00:16:52,195 --> 00:16:54,506
If you spent less time focusing
on other people's flaws,

328
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,826
you'd notice you've got
some of your own.

329
00:16:56,948 --> 00:16:58,807
Speaking of flaws,
Dodger game, Friday night?

330
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,785
- I didn't say that I didn't.
- Great. You want to hear some?

331
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:04,762
- It seems like you want to tell me.
- Yeah, I do.

332
00:17:05,132 --> 00:17:07,101
You drink too much, write too little,

333
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:09,597
and the only exercise you get
is in the bedroom.

334
00:17:09,723 --> 00:17:12,402
You love women, but you hate
yourself, so any woman

335
00:17:12,524 --> 00:17:15,374
who actually really does like you
is ultimately deemed a fool.

336
00:17:17,353 --> 00:17:19,882
And seeing as that woman
could pretty much be anyone,

337
00:17:21,316 --> 00:17:22,820
this one is saying goodbye.

338
00:17:23,504 --> 00:17:27,139
Hold on just one second. I seem to
have hurt you, and I apologize for that.

339
00:17:27,658 --> 00:17:29,722
But that's not what this is about.

340
00:17:30,573 --> 00:17:32,870
This is about something else.
Tell me what it's about.

341
00:17:35,926 --> 00:17:37,074
"B.R.B.", Hank.

342
00:17:39,903 --> 00:17:42,650
I will go and make sure she
doesn't kill herself this time.

343
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:46,421
And by the way, getting all aggro
about a little stinky pinky

344
00:17:46,571 --> 00:17:49,290
is definitely a symptom
of a much bigger problem.

345
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,469
Oh, jeez.

346
00:17:57,182 --> 00:17:59,369
I don't know what she's talking about.

347
00:18:02,353 --> 00:18:03,353
Bitches.

348
00:18:14,272 --> 00:18:15,272
Intruder.

349
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:20,072
- What are you doing here?
- You just spooked myself.

350
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:23,378
That was very cool, what you did today,

351
00:18:23,925 --> 00:18:26,527
- talking at Mia's school.
- Oh, yeah, can we

352
00:18:26,725 --> 00:18:29,404
please agree right now
to never send Becca there?

353
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,532
- How's my girl?
- I'm good.

354
00:18:32,655 --> 00:18:35,303
I've got a lot of work on, but, yeah...

355
00:18:35,425 --> 00:18:38,268
I was talking about Becca,
but I like where your head's at.

356
00:18:38,623 --> 00:18:41,598
That's embarrassing. I just slipped
into a past life for a second.

357
00:18:41,735 --> 00:18:43,307
I still get my mail there.

358
00:18:44,632 --> 00:18:45,967
I love your feet.

359
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:49,226
She's got a crush on her guitar teacher.

360
00:18:49,348 --> 00:18:50,348
That's great.

361
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:53,639
At least it's not the captain
of the fucking football team.

362
00:18:53,817 --> 00:18:55,040
Is he crush worthy?

363
00:18:55,163 --> 00:18:57,350
Does he bring out your inner rocker slut?

364
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:00,233
You know, he is pretty fucking hot,
yeah.

365
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:03,219
- Should I be worried?
- Isn't that Bill's problem?

366
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,623
Yeah, I don't know
if Bill worries enough.

367
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:07,045
Whatever.

368
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:09,081
Hey, you think I might...

369
00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:12,280
Take Becca out for some ice cream
or something?

370
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,634
You could, but, you know,
you just missed her.

371
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:18,727
- She's snoozing. Sorry.
- Shit.

372
00:19:23,076 --> 00:19:25,830
- Can I ask you something?
- If you must.

373
00:19:27,703 --> 00:19:30,393
In this... past life of ours,

374
00:19:31,884 --> 00:19:34,993
was I mean to you? Did I ever...

375
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,075
Did I make you feel stupid?

376
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:41,901
You weren't mean, no.

377
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,267
But you can be pretty hard
on people, Hank.

378
00:19:48,308 --> 00:19:50,159
I wish it was different.

379
00:19:51,331 --> 00:19:52,547
And so do I.

380
00:19:53,853 --> 00:19:54,950
But it's not.

381
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,893
How is that girl
from the fund-raiser?

382
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,370
She is pissed at me.

383
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,123
- She's not.
- Yeah.

384
00:20:06,723 --> 00:20:08,014
She'll get over it.

385
00:20:12,823 --> 00:20:14,150
Is that Bill's jacket?

386
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:19,282
That's a long story. I got to go.
Good night, foot.

387
00:21:16,653 --> 00:21:20,720
You know, it's not fair to say "B.R.B"
and then never actually B.R.B.?

388
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,610
But apology accepted.

389
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:25,119
Come here.

390
00:21:25,992 --> 00:21:28,349
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

391
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:30,806
I needed my black skirt.

392
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,397
That's understandable.
It's probably hard

393
00:21:33,524 --> 00:21:36,394
to be taken seriously in a courtroom
when you're bottomless.

394
00:21:36,868 --> 00:21:39,651
Though <i>I</i> would take you seriously.

395
00:21:41,214 --> 00:21:44,348
I... also wanted to give you this.

396
00:21:45,563 --> 00:21:46,636
Shit.

397
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,811
So, you're gonna blow this whole thing

398
00:21:50,048 --> 00:21:52,479
my issues with the language
of cyberspace?

399
00:21:52,717 --> 00:21:54,936
What's this whole thing
you're talking about?

400
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:57,780
We drink, we fuck, we watch
old movies in your apartment.

401
00:21:58,071 --> 00:21:59,525
Sounds fucking awesome.

402
00:22:01,204 --> 00:22:03,744
You're just pissed
'cause I beat you to the punch.

403
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:05,758
You were looking for an excuse to bail.

404
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:07,220
So says you.

405
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:10,201
- But I guess we'll never find out.
- I guess not.

406
00:22:14,492 --> 00:22:15,834
He left his wife.

407
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:24,993
That's what this was about. Fuck.

408
00:22:25,447 --> 00:22:27,138
In a way, I have you to thank.

409
00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:30,410
- You really did rattle his cage.
- Yeah.

410
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:32,756
Glad to be of service, Milady.

411
00:22:35,392 --> 00:22:36,409
I just...

412
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,101
I just feel so used.

413
00:22:39,465 --> 00:22:42,046
Shut up, we were using each other.

414
00:22:44,134 --> 00:22:46,752
I love how you're taking
the moral high ground here.

415
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:49,029
I'm sure that if I canvassed
the West Side,

416
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:52,141
I'd find more than a few girls
who feel used and abused by you.

417
00:22:52,684 --> 00:22:56,052
You seem to think that I have
this narrow perception of you?

418
00:22:56,281 --> 00:22:58,645
But it's you with the narrow
perception of me.

419
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,772
I love women.
I have all their albums.

420
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,208
Shit!

421
00:23:03,044 --> 00:23:07,235
I think I'd just feel better about it
if I didn't think you were re-entering

422
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,488
this hopelessly dysfunctional
relationship

423
00:23:09,615 --> 00:23:11,797
with an aggressively mediocre white guy.

424
00:23:11,997 --> 00:23:13,761
I've spent time with the man.

425
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,583
Time stood still.

426
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:20,014
This from someone who's still hopelessly
in love with his ex... whatever.

427
00:23:20,294 --> 00:23:22,075
Well, at least she's cool.

428
00:23:23,565 --> 00:23:25,213
Okay, what are you... 4?

429
00:23:27,063 --> 00:23:29,599
Perhaps... I don't know.

430
00:23:31,255 --> 00:23:32,746
We just missed it, Hank.

431
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,462
In another lifetime, we would
have been a scorching couple.

432
00:23:37,691 --> 00:23:38,976
But in this one, we...

433
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:40,974
Missed it. Missed it.

434
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:43,792
All right.

435
00:23:45,447 --> 00:23:47,411
Well, congratulations.

436
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:49,984
Best of luck
in all your future endeavors.

437
00:23:50,106 --> 00:23:53,850
And don't forget all the times I brought
you to fruition. 33, to be exact.

438
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:58,792
And when married guy
goes back to his wife,

439
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:03,178
which he will,
I hope that you come try to find me.

440
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:06,378
I hope that you know where to look.

441
00:24:07,496 --> 00:24:10,843
Face down in a puddle of your own sick?
Still not writing?

442
00:24:12,112 --> 00:24:13,112
L.O.L.

443
00:24:13,766 --> 00:24:15,257
L.O. fucking L.

444
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,783
- Bye.
- Bye.

445
00:24:57,961 --> 00:24:59,218
You're quiet.

446
00:25:00,088 --> 00:25:02,288
- I like quiet.
- Yeah, me too.

447
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:05,652
As long as you're okay.

448
00:25:07,236 --> 00:25:08,472
My heart hurts.

449
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,454
God, baby. Mine, too.

450
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:13,958
Is it boy trouble?

451
00:25:14,176 --> 00:25:16,485
Me too. Well, girl trouble.

452
00:25:18,957 --> 00:25:20,685
You want to talk about it?

453
00:25:22,456 --> 00:25:24,838
I just want to know
when it stops hurting.

454
00:25:26,603 --> 00:25:27,711
Here's the deal,

455
00:25:27,838 --> 00:25:30,983
and you won't wanna hear it, it's gonna
sound like piss-poor parenting,

456
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,956
but if you're lucky, never.

457
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,280
<i>Oh, what could ail thee,
knight at arms, alone</i>

458
00:25:38,462 --> 00:25:39,826
<i>and palely loitering?</i>

459
00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:43,577
<i>The sedge has withered from the lake,
and no birds sing.</i>

460
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,796
Keats, <i>La belle dame sans merci</i>?

461
00:25:47,596 --> 00:25:49,650
Is that the best you can do, dad?

462
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,061
How about something from this century?

463
00:25:52,243 --> 00:25:55,279
How about... You got Dylan's
<i>Blood on the tracks</i>?

464
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,995
You ever listen to that?
Classic heartbreak album.

465
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,941
I can gift it to you on your Ipod.

466
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,998
<i>- If you see her, say hello.</i>
- Dad...

467
00:26:03,231 --> 00:26:06,046
<i>- She might be in Tangier.</i>
- Dad...

468
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:09,293
<i>She left here last early spring.</i>

469
00:26:09,858 --> 00:26:13,497
<i>Is living there, I hear.</i>
