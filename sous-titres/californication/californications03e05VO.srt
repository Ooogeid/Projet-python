1
00:00:07,358 --> 00:00:11,663
<i>Flight 2570, New York,
JFK, now boarding all rows.</i>

2
00:00:11,788 --> 00:00:13,848
Okay, well,
there you go, young lady.

3
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:15,973
Off into the wild blue yonder.

4
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:19,935
Great. Maybe I'll get lucky
and my plane will explode in mid-air.

5
00:00:21,148 --> 00:00:22,614
I don't get it, Becks.

6
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:24,523
What could possibly be so awful

7
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:28,353
about visiting the woman who pushed you
through her magnificent vagina?

8
00:00:29,105 --> 00:00:30,136
In New York.

9
00:00:30,617 --> 00:00:32,096
In the fall, no less.

10
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:35,295
You're gonna be stepping off
that plane into a Woody Allen film.

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,765
And not recent Woody Allen,
old Woody Allen.

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,038
<i>Annie Hall, Manhattan</i> Woody Allen.

13
00:00:40,163 --> 00:00:41,955
I'm pretty jealous right now.

14
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:44,919
Chelsea has Lakers tickets.

15
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:48,172
- So what? You hate basketball.
- You're missing the point.

16
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:50,131
It's a killer scene.

17
00:00:51,973 --> 00:00:54,345
I know you're in there somewhere,
baby girl.

18
00:00:55,414 --> 00:00:56,902
My sweet little partner in crime.

19
00:00:57,027 --> 00:01:00,059
And you're having a good laugh about
this, even if it's only on the inside.

20
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:05,106
Have a nice trip.

21
00:01:05,391 --> 00:01:06,991
Kiss mama bear for me.

22
00:01:07,564 --> 00:01:08,614
I love you.

23
00:01:12,262 --> 00:01:13,262
Stay.

24
00:01:13,828 --> 00:01:14,657
Stay?

25
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,032
Stay. Stay.

26
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:19,995
Come on, turn around, just once.

27
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:23,249
Then I'll know you still love me.
God, send me a sign from on high.

28
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:24,583
Come on.

29
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,130
Oh, yeah,
that's what I'm talking about.

30
00:02:17,683 --> 00:02:19,439
All right, well,
she's up, up and away.

31
00:02:19,564 --> 00:02:23,100
<i>I'm so excited. I can't wait
to squeeze that little peanut.</i>

32
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,555
I wouldn't get too excited.
She hasn't been very pleasant lately.

33
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,105
Kind of a little shit, actually.

34
00:02:28,604 --> 00:02:30,785
Hey, come on.
Don't poison the well.

35
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,569
I know we're gonna have a great time,
she and I. I can feel it.

36
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:34,913
Okus-dokus.

37
00:02:35,195 --> 00:02:37,312
I'm just warning you,
something post-pubescent

38
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:39,492
and wicked your way comes.

39
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:41,721
- I wish you could come with.
- Yeah, me too.

40
00:02:41,846 --> 00:02:44,747
- I'm not anticipating this W/E much.
- <i>Come on, Hank.</i>

41
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,374
- He's your best friend.
- <i>Once upon a time, in long island.</i>

42
00:02:47,784 --> 00:02:51,420
He calls me up after many years
saying he's got something to tell me.

43
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,839
Whatever.
Just have fun, you know?

44
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:58,427
Call me when she lands. Give her a kiss
for me. Give yourself a kiss for me too.

45
00:02:58,902 --> 00:03:00,623
- Talk to you later.
- Bye.

46
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,936
You handsome motherfucker. I just
have to have me a piece of that ass.

47
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:09,597
- Fuckin'...
- Wait, I'm not through.

48
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:11,787
Zloz, shit.

49
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:15,291
- What's up, buddy?
- Where'd that plane come from, 1987?

50
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,655
You look exactly the same.
And that smell.

51
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:21,534
What is that, booze, cigarettes,
and <i>Drakkar Noir?</i> Takes me right back.

52
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:25,329
Yeah, what about you? You look like
half a fag in this smoking jacket.

53
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,334
You smell pretty much the same...

54
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:28,958
Like a cock dipped in shit.

55
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:31,933
It's good to see you, man.

56
00:03:32,805 --> 00:03:34,255
Yeah, it's been a long time.

57
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:37,174
Whose fault is that?
Who never comes back to the island?

58
00:03:37,526 --> 00:03:40,190
Fuckin' fancy book writer Hank Moody,
that's who.

59
00:03:40,315 --> 00:03:42,912
Well, you know,
they won't let me back.

60
00:03:43,037 --> 00:03:44,956
I divulged too many
small town secrets.

61
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:46,308
Named too many names.

62
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,520
Well, here I finally am, man, in LA.

63
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:52,026
L-fuckin'-A.

64
00:03:52,345 --> 00:03:55,216
Yeah, well, what's up? You sounded
pretty mysterious on the phone.

65
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:58,304
Yeah, later. Later for that, man.
There's a lot of time to shoot the shit.

66
00:03:58,429 --> 00:04:00,849
First, I want to see
Britney's vertical smile.

67
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:03,826
I don't know if she's showing this week.
I'll have to check the schedule.

68
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,370
All right, then,
I want to act like a millionaire

69
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:10,251
and get properly faced with my best
buddy in the whole world, Hank Moody.

70
00:04:10,614 --> 00:04:11,624
What do you say?

71
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:13,483
I say we do it.
Let's shoot the moon.

72
00:04:13,608 --> 00:04:15,421
If we only get halfway there,
so be it.

73
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,533
- It's better than working for the man.
- Or dying 5 miles from your birthplace.

74
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:19,591
Mr. Amato.

75
00:04:19,855 --> 00:04:22,079
11th grade english.
Words to live by.

76
00:04:22,551 --> 00:04:25,222
You know, come on,
let's get fuckin' ossified.

77
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:29,971
How many kids now?

78
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,381
Three, which is...

79
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,590
Three too fuckin' many.

80
00:04:36,704 --> 00:04:38,193
I made you come with one finger.

81
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,195
You imagine what
I could do with the rest.

82
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,615
Jesus Christ, Zloz,
that old chestnut?

83
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,533
Stand down, charm school.

84
00:04:44,932 --> 00:04:46,285
I apologize for my friend.

85
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,871
He's sick in the head.
Just two days out of the asylum.

86
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,646
He's doing okay, having said that.

87
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:53,417
We'd like another round, my lady,
if you don't mind. Thank you.

88
00:04:54,257 --> 00:04:56,910
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- What? What?

89
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:58,976
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:03,124
There's smokin' hot bitches
everywhere you look, you know?

91
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:05,220
- What's the move here?
- The move?

92
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,640
I mean, they all seem like
a bunch of stuck up cunts.

93
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,976
That's the move. That's the line.
Try that one out. See where it gets you.

94
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,520
- You still pulling a ton of ass?
- I do all right.

95
00:05:13,844 --> 00:05:15,919
I got my dick wet first.
Remember that shit.

96
00:05:16,044 --> 00:05:17,524
You guys ready to settle up?

97
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,035
- No, fuck you.
- No, let me. Let me.

98
00:05:30,128 --> 00:05:31,461
- Look at you.
- Look at me.

99
00:05:31,586 --> 00:05:32,948
I'm... you know...

100
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,292
I feel a little
underdressed in this joint.

101
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:37,586
That's because you are underdressed.

102
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:41,507
- You look like a fuckin' landscaper.
- I am a fuckin' landscaper.

103
00:05:42,688 --> 00:05:45,135
- I own my own business now.
- That's terrific. Good for you.

104
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,596
Not quite as nice as getting
paid to make shit up.

105
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:50,294
- That is much harder than it looks.
- Right.

106
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,771
I'd love to have her sit on my face
before I die.

107
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,649
Like you'd ever cheat on Kim.
How is she?

108
00:05:59,195 --> 00:06:00,905
That's what I meant
to tell you, man.

109
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,237
- What?
- We're through.

110
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,196
What?

111
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,407
We called it quits, man.
It's over.

112
00:06:06,676 --> 00:06:08,871
- What happened?
- We get in a fight.

113
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,122
Words were spoken.
Household appliances were thrown.

114
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,081
I got in a cab.

115
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:16,992
Hopped on a plane for LA.

116
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,749
You don't mind if I crash on your couch
for a couple of weeks, do you?

117
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:23,507
Yeah, I mind. I'm trying
to raise a daughter, numb nuts.

118
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:24,943
Becca. How's she doing?

119
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:27,238
- What is she now?
- You won't do any better than Kim.

120
00:06:27,363 --> 00:06:31,367
She's beautiful. I used to jerk off
to that girl every night in HS, almost.

121
00:06:31,826 --> 00:06:33,416
You were my hero
when you nailed her.

122
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,237
Yeah, well, how does the saying go?

123
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:37,850
For every beautiful woman, there's
a guy who's bored of fucking her.

124
00:06:37,975 --> 00:06:39,857
Let's get out of here, man.
Where's the party?

125
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:41,076
What party?

126
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,212
Party, there's a party
out there somewhere.

127
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:46,781
And a blonde with big tits waiting
for me to bang her stupid, all right?

128
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,206
Call your agent.

129
00:06:48,944 --> 00:06:50,993
Isn't that what he gets paid to do?

130
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,453
You don't know my agent.

131
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:55,622
Great, so we'll see you there.
Looking forward to it.

132
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,290
Any friend of yours.

133
00:06:57,836 --> 00:06:59,606
I'll see what I can do
about the blonde.

134
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:01,281
With big tits, right?

135
00:07:01,406 --> 00:07:03,562
I'll make a note of that.
See you, Hank.

136
00:07:09,257 --> 00:07:10,179
Hey, you.

137
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:13,390
Hey there, porn star.

138
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:19,948
Your boobs, they're really... big.

139
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,490
I know, right?

140
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:24,318
So that's what my last
ten grand looks like?

141
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,736
You can touch them.

142
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,154
- Really?
- Sure.

143
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,672
You paid for 'em.

144
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:30,656
Feel me up, citizen.

145
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,500
I knew you'd be back,
you know, sooner or later.

146
00:07:41,147 --> 00:07:43,855
- Yeah? You did?
- Sure, I said so, didn't i?

147
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,309
This one's heavier.

148
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:46,634
Yeah, you did.

149
00:07:47,056 --> 00:07:48,979
Yeah, when I broke up with you.

150
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:51,367
You were all: "you'll be back".

151
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:53,685
"They all come back
sooner or later".

152
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,682
Exactly, the thing is,
though, Daisy, see,

153
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:59,757
as much as I look back fondly
on our little afternoon in the sun...

154
00:08:00,326 --> 00:08:01,810
I don't think I can go back there.

155
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:03,816
I'm trying to mend fences
with the missus.

156
00:08:05,324 --> 00:08:07,611
You two are great together.
Good luck with that.

157
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:08,987
Well, thank you.

158
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,719
I have something I need to tell you.

159
00:08:14,235 --> 00:08:15,385
I'm all ears.

160
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:19,701
Eyes, Charlie.

161
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,539
I've been making the rounds,
informing my partners

162
00:08:24,664 --> 00:08:26,880
of the various STDs I've contracted.

163
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,500
Nothing crazy, mind you.

164
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,525
Nothing life-threatening
or anything like that.

165
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,973
But you might want
to get to a doctor

166
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:36,360
and have him whip up
some kind of cocktail.

167
00:08:36,485 --> 00:08:37,787
Help fight it off.

168
00:08:37,912 --> 00:08:41,905
'cause let me tell you,
this is some really pernicious shit.

169
00:08:42,353 --> 00:08:45,357
My vagina looks like
downtown Baghdad right now.

170
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:49,175
- Charlie, are you okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

171
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,912
I'm just... I'm a little dizzy.
And... And clammy too.

172
00:08:52,037 --> 00:08:54,241
Do I feel clammy to you?
Is that how it starts?

173
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,315
This is some serious
<i>Scarface</i> shit here.

174
00:09:03,881 --> 00:09:05,081
It's the boys.

175
00:09:07,738 --> 00:09:09,426
This here is the almighty zloz,

176
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:11,253
my oldest friend
from the island of long.

177
00:09:11,378 --> 00:09:13,427
- Mr. Almighty, pleasure to meet you.
- You too.

178
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,637
Mike Zlozowski.
Very nice to meet you guys.

179
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,727
You've known him a long time.
Was he always such a prick?

180
00:09:18,852 --> 00:09:20,737
Always!
He's always been a ball buster.

181
00:09:20,862 --> 00:09:24,762
I spent half my life making sure
he didn't get his teeth kicked in.

182
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,398
True. He's my bodyguard.

183
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,151
Welcome, boys...
And girl.

184
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,030
You must be Runkle.

185
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:34,715
In fact, I am.

186
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,340
I see what you mean.

187
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,327
Great head for helming.

188
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,247
This is my husband, Ricardo Collini.

189
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,624
Call me Dickie.

190
00:09:44,174 --> 00:09:46,543
Have fun, cap'n.
You too.

191
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,380
Hold on a minute there.
You're married?

192
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,831
Yeah, 25 years and countin'.

193
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,783
I had no idea.

194
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,505
You never asked.

195
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:58,722
I feel very strange about this.

196
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,737
Runkle, don't worry.
Dickie and I have a very...

197
00:10:02,277 --> 00:10:04,099
A very open relationship.

198
00:10:04,224 --> 00:10:07,022
But, as you can see,
he has some limitations.

199
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,951
He is, however,
a master of the oral arts.

200
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,803
You ought to try him
sometime, honey.

201
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:19,785
There's no place like home.

202
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,853
Is your father a lumberjack?

203
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:24,115
Because every time I look at you,

204
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,544
I get serious wood in my pants.

205
00:10:31,655 --> 00:10:33,260
Do you think you're better than me?

206
00:10:33,385 --> 00:10:35,085
Nice one, Shecky Greene.

207
00:10:37,644 --> 00:10:40,222
To the city of angels
and its stuck-up snatch.

208
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,380
Can't we do better?
Let's drink to Levittown,

209
00:10:42,505 --> 00:10:44,005
from whence we came.

210
00:10:46,626 --> 00:10:47,896
I don't know, Moody.

211
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,917
I think I could get used to this.
I got a few screenplay ideas.

212
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:54,190
What's... What's stopping me
from taking this town by storm?

213
00:10:54,315 --> 00:10:56,424
Me. Just me.
I won't let you.

214
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,448
You gonna get in my way?

215
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,300
You gonna keep it all for yourself?

216
00:11:00,823 --> 00:11:03,348
That? That out there?
That's a fuckin' mirage.

217
00:11:03,473 --> 00:11:05,127
That doesn't exist, behind me.

218
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:07,473
You got everything
you ever want or need home.

219
00:11:07,598 --> 00:11:08,472
Trust me.

220
00:11:08,597 --> 00:11:10,043
What do you know about home?

221
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,811
You got out years ago.

222
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,760
Now, it's easy for you to spout
some working class hero,

223
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:18,690
springsteen bullshit
about the sanctity of small towns

224
00:11:18,815 --> 00:11:20,762
when you're driving a porsche.

225
00:11:21,018 --> 00:11:23,488
- You got it all wrong, man.
- I got it all wrong? Listen.

226
00:11:23,613 --> 00:11:25,786
You see that...
You see that girl over there?

227
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,604
I'm gonna go talk to her.
Maybe she's warm for my form,

228
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,098
maybe not, but...

229
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:34,067
You know, I'm no marky mark,
but I'm going down swinging tonight.

230
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,368
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

231
00:11:40,253 --> 00:11:41,703
What are you doing?

232
00:11:42,748 --> 00:11:43,748
This is...

233
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,652
Look...
All this erotica, got me all...

234
00:11:47,777 --> 00:11:48,777
<i>Grande.</i>

235
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,351
I'm all sexed up and shit.
And you know how I am.

236
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:56,357
- The more I gets, the more I wants.
- Yeah, but not tonight, maybe.

237
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,675
Maybe we just take a break,
you know.

238
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,312
What? Why don't you want to fuck me?

239
00:12:02,147 --> 00:12:04,597
'cause this is my boss's house.
That's why.

240
00:12:04,722 --> 00:12:07,486
Yeah, baby,
and your boss is a stone freak.

241
00:12:08,012 --> 00:12:09,711
I think she would very much approve

242
00:12:09,836 --> 00:12:12,020
of a quickie happening
right under her own roof.

243
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:17,581
Really, I'm sore still.
I mean, chafed, really.

244
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:20,132
Okay, what the fuck is going on?

245
00:12:20,257 --> 00:12:23,457
Nothing, I'm just...
I'm, you know, I guess a little,

246
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:26,682
overwhelmed by the whiplash
nature of our relationship...

247
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:29,498
Bullshit!
You fucked someone else, didn't you?

248
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,591
No, never.

249
00:12:31,716 --> 00:12:33,542
I am done with that behavior.

250
00:12:35,224 --> 00:12:36,838
Something's going on with you.

251
00:12:39,723 --> 00:12:42,010
Daisy... came to see me.

252
00:12:43,034 --> 00:12:45,706
I knew it!
I fucking knew it.

253
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,584
A woman knows that shit.

254
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:50,211
So, what, you want to get
back together with her now?

255
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,342
You're gonna have some
skanky little porno babies?

256
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:54,648
Why don't you make up
your fucking mind already?

257
00:12:55,847 --> 00:12:58,050
No, I told her
I want to be with you,

258
00:12:58,175 --> 00:12:59,225
only you...

259
00:12:59,532 --> 00:13:00,882
My one true love.

260
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:02,907
Really?

261
00:13:04,715 --> 00:13:06,909
What'd she say, that little tramp?

262
00:13:07,034 --> 00:13:09,421
Actually...
And this is interesting...

263
00:13:09,546 --> 00:13:12,290
She said that she had contracted
a few STDs.

264
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,877
Nothing crazy. Nothing a bolus
of antibiotics wouldn't cure.

265
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,421
Just... Knock it out.

266
00:13:19,408 --> 00:13:21,716
No, I seriously think
I'm gonna throw up right now.

267
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,428
That is exactly what I said! Right?

268
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:25,908
Or, I don't know.

269
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:29,266
Maybe I said, I was dizzy.
But it's the same difference, really.

270
00:13:32,991 --> 00:13:35,802
I'm taking your little
fucking girl car, Charlie.

271
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,082
And don't you dare
bother coming home tonight!

272
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,511
Fucking hell.

273
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:46,741
She's got a cock!

274
00:13:47,349 --> 00:13:48,326
Really?

275
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:50,494
Sure it wasn't just
an oversized clit?

276
00:13:50,619 --> 00:13:52,289
I know a cock when I touch one.

277
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,103
I... We were messing around,
okay, in the hot tub.

278
00:13:55,228 --> 00:13:57,961
I was getting ready to close.
She says she wants to tell me something.

279
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,644
Like she had a boyfriend.

280
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:03,925
Next thing I know, she's guiding
my hand down to her thin, bent dong.

281
00:14:04,249 --> 00:14:06,312
- Then what, you gave her a handy?
- Fuck you, man.

282
00:14:06,437 --> 00:14:08,377
- I fuckin' clocked her.
- There's laws.

283
00:14:08,502 --> 00:14:10,252
You can't do that.
That's a human being.

284
00:14:10,377 --> 00:14:12,194
You can't just be throwing
punches at people.

285
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,769
What the fuck is
wrong with you, Moody?

286
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:18,607
Have you been in LA so long
that a tranny means nothing to you?

287
00:14:21,303 --> 00:14:23,695
Your friend's
a closeted fucking homo!

288
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,430
That's what I've been telling him
for years. I have, really.

289
00:14:26,677 --> 00:14:28,617
See, them's fightin' words.

290
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,569
- Asshole... I thought you knew.
- You'll hit me now?

291
00:14:31,694 --> 00:14:34,956
When I realized you didn't,
I tried to break it to you gently.

292
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,467
Well, for what it's worth,
I think you're beautiful.

293
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,920
I think you could
totally pass for a lady.

294
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,922
- Thank you, sweetie.
- Anytime.

295
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:45,346
Why don't you guys get a room, maybe,
and suck each other's dicks?

296
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:47,599
I think he knew, deep down.

297
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:50,305
- He was looking for a little meat.
- Possibi...

298
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:52,474
Shit.

299
00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:55,329
Pause!

300
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:57,514
Boys, enough!

301
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,898
Up.

302
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,242
- There'll be no fighting in this house.
- This place is made for love.

303
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:10,004
The Collinis are open to all sizes,
shapes, and sexual preferences.

304
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:14,412
- Ignorance will not be tolerated.
- You're absolutely right, Sue.

305
00:15:14,777 --> 00:15:16,777
We are deeply ashamed. Deeply.

306
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,995
- Right, Zloz?
- Maybe you are...

307
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:21,920
I am deeply ashamed...

308
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,208
- That I touched a tranny's cock.
- All right, all right!

309
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:29,980
Now that we've got
that cleared away...

310
00:15:31,219 --> 00:15:33,472
You boys wanna go skiing with me?

311
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:36,283
Yeah, okay.

312
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,833
You see the mams on this broad?

313
00:16:00,302 --> 00:16:01,876
This guy was your BFF?

314
00:16:02,332 --> 00:16:03,582
I don't see it.

315
00:16:03,798 --> 00:16:06,798
You wouldn't know it to look at him now,
but he was the coolest kid in HS.

316
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,961
Not the smartest, but the funniest.

317
00:16:09,086 --> 00:16:10,385
A regular fuckin' riot.

318
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,187
He had the hottest girlfriend.

319
00:16:12,397 --> 00:16:15,124
We all wanted to be him.
I worshipped the guy.

320
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:16,799
I like you like this.

321
00:16:16,924 --> 00:16:17,924
Like what?

322
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,750
Like my new boyfriend.

323
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,910
Be careful, ladies.
I think I might have an STD.

324
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,572
You don't happen to have a dick,
do you? No offense.

325
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,790
None taken.

326
00:16:33,603 --> 00:16:34,980
Nope! No dick.

327
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:37,704
No pubic hair, either.

328
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:38,899
Dig that shit.

329
00:16:39,024 --> 00:16:41,324
I'm sorry I doubted you, sweetheart.

330
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:43,840
Bad boy. I'm gonna punish you.

331
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,128
You're my bitch. You my bitch?

332
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,423
That's right. Oh, yeah.

333
00:16:53,566 --> 00:16:55,055
What... Dude. Wait.

334
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,821
Stop it! Asshole! Get off!

335
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:01,289
Hey, fucker!

336
00:17:03,144 --> 00:17:04,594
You're out of here!

337
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,443
What happened?
What'd he do?

338
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:10,779
He was sucking on her titty,
and that ain't cool.

339
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,198
That is not cool.
What the fuck are you thinking?

340
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,241
Did you see those things?
They were epic, man.

341
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:18,683
It was like Pamela Anderso
meets Samantha Fox.

342
00:17:18,808 --> 00:17:20,203
- Remember her?
- Shut up.

343
00:17:20,328 --> 00:17:23,375
- Tits for days!
- I apologize... Shut up!

344
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:25,563
I'm throwing
working class out on his ass.

345
00:17:25,688 --> 00:17:26,888
Working class?

346
00:17:31,913 --> 00:17:32,913
Watch it!

347
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,741
You with me, compadre?

348
00:19:47,574 --> 00:19:49,074
Good morning, teach.

349
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:52,565
Our very first sleepover.

350
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:54,484
I wish I remembered more of it.

351
00:19:55,248 --> 00:19:56,653
Did we take a bubble bath?

352
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,781
There is evidence to
support that theory, yes.

353
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:05,132
Can I ask you a favor?

354
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:30,948
Good morning.

355
00:20:31,073 --> 00:20:32,246
Good morning.

356
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:38,610
Did we... Did we...

357
00:20:38,735 --> 00:20:39,904
Fuck, yeah.

358
00:20:42,165 --> 00:20:44,362
- Was I any good?
- Oh, the best.

359
00:20:44,487 --> 00:20:46,187
You've got a great cock.

360
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,790
Fuckin'- a.

361
00:20:49,343 --> 00:20:50,393
Good times.

362
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:54,101
Morning, kids.

363
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:58,206
- Dude.
- Buddy?

364
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,356
This place is beautiful, man.

365
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:17,774
Takes your breath away, sometimes.

366
00:21:18,084 --> 00:21:19,645
That's one of the perks.

367
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,487
That and in-n-out burger.

368
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,865
- I got a question for you.
- Shoot.

369
00:21:24,111 --> 00:21:26,382
How come you never made
it to my wedding, man?

370
00:21:26,783 --> 00:21:27,858
Man.

371
00:21:29,213 --> 00:21:30,213
I don't know.

372
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:32,478
I guess I was pissed.

373
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,458
You know...

374
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:36,614
I didn't want to see
you ruin your life.

375
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,890
We had a plan.

376
00:21:38,824 --> 00:21:40,453
Right, and I fucked it up.

377
00:21:40,578 --> 00:21:41,578
Well...

378
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,135
We were gonna get out of there,
together.

379
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:47,211
You were gonna be a rock star.
I was gonna be a famous write

380
00:21:47,772 --> 00:21:50,250
that's the way I thought back then.
Black and white.

381
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:51,925
I was a fuckin' idiot.

382
00:21:52,365 --> 00:21:54,955
Couldn't have been more wrong.
You did a beautiful thing.

383
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,912
You stepped up,
married that girl, had a family.

384
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,423
Don't fuck it up.

385
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:02,371
Don't chase these...

386
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:05,966
girls with fake titties
and half-baked screenplay ideas.

387
00:22:07,688 --> 00:22:08,688
Dude...

388
00:22:08,836 --> 00:22:10,896
I'm sorry about your father, man.

389
00:22:13,581 --> 00:22:14,581
Thank you.

390
00:22:17,633 --> 00:22:19,295
Thanks for the flowers.

391
00:22:22,553 --> 00:22:24,000
Did you hear about Mr. Amato?

392
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:26,094
- He passed away last year.
- Did he?

393
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,243
I guess that really proves his theory,
that you...

394
00:22:31,689 --> 00:22:34,769
You really do die less than five
miles from where you were born.

395
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:38,064
- Now, that might happen to me now.
- What?

396
00:22:38,507 --> 00:22:41,317
- What do you mean?
- I get these nosebleeds.

397
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:44,076
What do you mean nosebleeds?
What are you talking about?

398
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:46,364
I never thought much about them,
but...

399
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,726
Kim finally made me
go to the doctor.

400
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:50,952
And it turns out I'm sick, dude.

401
00:22:51,394 --> 00:22:53,598
What do you mean sick?
What kind of sick?

402
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,448
Sick like I gotta...

403
00:22:55,573 --> 00:22:57,508
Like I got something
I gotta deal with sick.

404
00:22:57,633 --> 00:22:59,443
I got to get a whole
shitload of tests.

405
00:22:59,568 --> 00:23:00,752
I keep putting it off.

406
00:23:00,877 --> 00:23:03,423
And that's why kim and I had
that big fuckin' blowout, man.

407
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,627
It's not a good time right now.

408
00:23:09,373 --> 00:23:11,382
At least I got to see all this,
though, man.

409
00:23:14,665 --> 00:23:15,852
You're not gonna die.

410
00:23:17,227 --> 00:23:19,062
Maybe, you know.
Maybe not.

411
00:23:19,347 --> 00:23:20,522
Whatever happens,

412
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,342
it's got me thinking
about a lot of things,

413
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:25,830
About fuckin' short it all is.

414
00:23:26,212 --> 00:23:29,824
How you and I, once upon a time,
we were thick as thieves.

415
00:23:30,203 --> 00:23:31,575
I don't know what happened.

416
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:34,012
I wish I knew the moment
where it all changed,

417
00:23:34,137 --> 00:23:37,165
- 'Cause I would do things differently.
- You didn't do anything wrong.

418
00:23:38,064 --> 00:23:40,524
I didn't mean to let things
slide with you, Zloz.

419
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:43,561
I guess I did.

420
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:46,869
You were my best friend, Hank.

421
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:48,517
I'll never forget.

422
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,590
Some of the greatest times of my life,
you know?

423
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:55,132
Maybe that mak m me a big,
pathetic fuckin' loser,

424
00:23:55,474 --> 00:23:59,096
but, once upon a time
has got to count for something.

425
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,032
- Right?
- Course it does.

426
00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:03,344
I just...
I didn't belong there anymore.

427
00:24:04,837 --> 00:24:06,611
Fuck, I don't belong here, either.

428
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,794
It doesn't change
the fact that I love you, man.

429
00:24:15,844 --> 00:24:18,329
Look at you, Moody.
I can't believe...

430
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:22,942
I haven't seen you cry
since Thurman Munson died.

431
00:24:23,501 --> 00:24:25,240
You got to bring up Thurman Munson?

432
00:24:25,571 --> 00:24:28,048
- You fucking asshole.
- I had to go there because...

433
00:24:28,173 --> 00:24:30,411
- You were crying, I was crying.
- It was beautiful.

434
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:32,915
You were crying about Andy Gibb.

435
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,897
I got to pick up the little monster.

436
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:58,578
No worries.

437
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:03,645
Gives me plenty of time to get
loaded and piss myself on the plane.

438
00:25:11,197 --> 00:25:12,635
It was good to see you, Zloz.

439
00:25:12,974 --> 00:25:15,626
Yeah, you too, man.
Thanks for showing me a good time.

440
00:25:16,091 --> 00:25:18,592
You know, what happens in LA...

441
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,522
- Right, brother?
- Yes, it stays in the vault.

442
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:25,160
You think you're gonna be able to
patch things up with the old lady?

443
00:25:25,285 --> 00:25:27,692
To tell you the truth,
she doesn't even know I'm gone.

444
00:25:28,418 --> 00:25:29,716
She was so pissed at me,

445
00:25:29,841 --> 00:25:32,321
she took off with a couple of
her girlfriends to Atlantic City.

446
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:36,371
For all I know, she could have
been making out with a tranny too.

447
00:25:36,496 --> 00:25:39,495
- You're a colossal pussy.
- You better come visit.

448
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:41,865
I got a bunch of kids with
Hank Moody stories.

449
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,755
They don't have a face
to put to the name.

450
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,619
- That's not good.
- No, it's not.

451
00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:51,485
- I love you.
- I love you too.

452
00:25:53,472 --> 00:25:55,731
- Fuckin' homo.
- OK, faggot. Go.

453
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:01,767
Made you look...
At my cock.

454
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:14,488
Look who's here.

455
00:26:15,935 --> 00:26:17,617
Not even a hello.
Good times.

456
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:22,075
Good times, good times.

457
00:26:22,753 --> 00:26:24,040
What are you doing?

458
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:26,792
What am I, your limo driver?
Come on. You get in the front.

459
00:26:29,603 --> 00:26:32,402
What? Were you just
gonna leave me behind?

460
00:26:41,187 --> 00:26:42,950
Merry fucking Christmas.

461
00:26:43,578 --> 00:26:44,852
Can we go home already?

462
00:26:46,203 --> 00:26:47,203
Shut up.
