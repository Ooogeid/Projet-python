00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:02,001
Previously on <i>Californication...</i>

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,378
I'd like to introduce you
to Richard Bates, the writer.

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,589
- Big fan.
- Who wants to see me tuck

4
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:08,174
and do the pee pee dance?

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,096
We're really gonna do this,
sell the place?

6
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,681
- Isn't that what we want?
- Sure. I guess.

7
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,360
I just want to be done with it.

8
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,479
I want to sell this fucking house
and get on with the rest of my life.

9
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:23,688
You're saying just pack up
and leave L.A.?

10
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,650
the three of us
move back to New York?

11
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:28,118
Yeah, end of the semester, whatever.

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,238
So which one are you sleeping with?

13
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,115
- Excuse me?
- My bets are on the young,

14
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,742
voluptuous student.

15
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,410
This is so not fair.

16
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,121
I'm in love with you, Hank Moody.

17
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,167
I've never stepped
outside of my marriage before.

18
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,385
Please, go.

19
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,965
Something must be different.
That's right. You fucked my wife.

20
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,008
- There's that.
- What does that mean?

21
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,677
- You didn't tell her?
- What?

22
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:54,929
Becca's father and I
had a slight indiscretion.

23
00:00:55,281 --> 00:00:57,181
She's got to be kidding me, right?

24
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,558
I don't want to hear about
Felicia and her midlife crisis.

25
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,479
- Wait, who else has he been fucking?
- You're a goddamn girl whisperer.

26
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:06,148
I can't believe
you slept with all of them.

27
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,526
- Will you live?
- I'm trying.

28
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,111
That's all anybody can ask for.

29
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:11,654
Check this out.

30
00:01:25,548 --> 00:01:28,498
Lordy bagordy, we made
some fucking love, woman.

31
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,025
They should put us
in <i>the joy of sex...</i>

32
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,319
a nice little pencil sketch
of us doing it.

33
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:35,744
We're that good.

34
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,719
Who are you right now?

35
00:01:38,805 --> 00:01:41,559
I'm not sensing
the same level of enthusiasm.

36
00:01:42,824 --> 00:01:44,291
I... It was good.

37
00:01:44,835 --> 00:01:47,876
Come to think of it, you weren't
quite as vocal as you normally are.

38
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:50,051
I mean, you've never been
a screamer per se,

39
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:53,676
but I can always count on you
for a little intense moaning.

40
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,357
Hank, stop it.

41
00:01:57,108 --> 00:01:59,158
Thank you.
Thank you for that.

42
00:01:59,906 --> 00:02:03,857
A woman does love a reenactment
of the most vulnerable moment.

43
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,842
But you got there, right?

44
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,048
Close.

45
00:02:12,106 --> 00:02:13,924
I see.
It was, like, a tiny one.

46
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,411
- That happens. That's understandable.
- Not so much.

47
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:20,139
What?
Are you serious?

48
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,392
You mean not even a little one,
like a micro-orgasm?

49
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,019
- No.
- Are you sure?

50
00:02:25,292 --> 00:02:26,437
This is upsetting.

51
00:02:26,798 --> 00:02:29,231
The truth is, Hank,
we've been through some...

52
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:31,442
We've been through
some really hard times.

53
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,879
- I know that.
- So...

54
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:36,081
But we've always had
our fire and our passion.

55
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:39,834
Our beautiful sex organs
don't know about our problems,

56
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,789
and we should definitely
keep them out of it.

57
00:02:41,914 --> 00:02:44,872
You got to give me another
chance to please you, woman.

58
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,161
We, we can't. It's too late.
It's not gonna work.

59
00:02:47,286 --> 00:02:49,286
No, there's too much pressure.

60
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,504
No. Anyway, we have plans.

61
00:02:51,937 --> 00:02:54,121
It's Saturday.
I can do this all day.

62
00:02:54,246 --> 00:02:55,246
Felicia.

63
00:02:57,124 --> 00:03:00,054
Your new friend.
She invited us for lunch.

64
00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:03,432
- I know. I had to say yes, because...
- No, you didn't.

65
00:03:03,903 --> 00:03:07,144
God, that woman is so annoying.
She's so irritating.

66
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,167
Yeah, that's good.
Like that, only louder and deeper.

67
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,643
I can work with that.
Me love you long time.

68
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,768
It's over.

69
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,621
I got to go.
I got to get ready.

70
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:19,046
All right.
Just give me a moment...

71
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:23,565
while I talk my testicles
into descending.

72
00:03:27,334 --> 00:03:28,165
Guys?

73
00:04:18,288 --> 00:04:21,330
Looks like there's some kind
of a book club or something.

74
00:04:21,455 --> 00:04:22,455
Of a sort.

75
00:04:24,726 --> 00:04:25,702
Oh, dear.

76
00:04:25,827 --> 00:04:28,827
At least it won't be
a dull Saturday afternoon.

77
00:04:28,952 --> 00:04:30,144
Welcome.

78
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,094
Hello. Come in.

79
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,945
- You shouldn't have. Thank you.
- No, it is you who shouldn't have.

80
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,153
This is quite a surprise.

81
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,768
- I think pleasure is the word.
- Or surprise.

82
00:04:40,893 --> 00:04:42,865
They all heard
that I was having you over.

83
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:46,160
Guess the whole ya-ya sisterhood
had to get in on it.

84
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:49,620
We can't let you skip town
without a fond farewell.

85
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,417
Our last class was very unsatisfying,
since you didn't teach us anything.

86
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,880
This is Jill. She was Hank's
teaching assistant this semester,

87
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,448
And that's Jackie.

88
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:01,592
We met in class, right?

89
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,802
- We were all there...
- In a way.

90
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,679
Why don't I come with you guys?

91
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,473
We can hang out,
try on some lip gloss,

92
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,535
- you know, sparkly?
- You made your bed.

93
00:05:11,235 --> 00:05:13,604
Now you're gonna have to lie in it.
Have fun, Hank.

94
00:05:21,815 --> 00:05:24,006
Wake the fuck up, Runkle.

95
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,701
Open house time.

96
00:05:28,304 --> 00:05:31,931
You know the house won't sell
if we're within five miles of it.

97
00:05:32,056 --> 00:05:34,206
Give me ten minutes, ten minutes.

98
00:05:34,488 --> 00:05:35,488
Come on!

99
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,461
We got to jet.

100
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:41,548
Buyers can smell our impending divorce
from the freeway.

101
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,408
Coming!
I'm coming.

102
00:05:47,022 --> 00:05:48,472
You really are coming. Barf.

103
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,882
I told you.

104
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:53,053
And I told you.
She never fucking listens, am I right?

105
00:05:58,102 --> 00:05:59,525
You must be Marcy.
I'm...

106
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,860
Getting your pants and getting
the fuck out of my house.

107
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,846
Now, please.
Thank you.

108
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:06,228
There's a good girl.
Off you go.

109
00:06:08,706 --> 00:06:09,906
I'll call you.

110
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:13,289
Really?
The floor, that's your move?

111
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,874
You said not to mess up the bed
if we're showing the house.

112
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,126
Christ, Runkle!

113
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,128
I'm sorry
she's not a coke-snorting teen idol

114
00:06:19,507 --> 00:06:20,902
or a big black rapist.

115
00:06:21,027 --> 00:06:22,756
Not everyone can have
class up the ass.

116
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,190
No ass.

117
00:06:24,614 --> 00:06:25,779
Just class.

118
00:06:30,549 --> 00:06:32,784
I could take the stubbornness,
really I could,

119
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:35,202
and the substance abuse
and the lateness

120
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,814
and the "cooler than school and all
the rest of us ne'er do well" attitude,

121
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,916
but the thing that absolutely got me

122
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:44,412
was the unwarranted advice
about my biological clock.

123
00:06:45,892 --> 00:06:48,406
But, you know,
he's fully qualified to do that,

124
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,325
because he has such
a deep understanding

125
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,120
- of womanhood.
- Shouldn't you be defending me?

126
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:54,872
You, talking up my good points?

127
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,715
Yeah. I will later.
Right now I'm really enjoying

128
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,254
this kind of appraisal
of your little idiosyncrasies,

129
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,614
you know, the things
that I have grown

130
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:06,247
to know and love about you.

131
00:07:06,372 --> 00:07:08,135
The cracks.
It's how the light gets in.

132
00:07:08,497 --> 00:07:10,012
More pimm's, anyone?

133
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,390
Hit me with that. You know,
it's not an act... this whole thing.

134
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,719
I'm very sensitive
to the pain and suffering of women.

135
00:07:15,844 --> 00:07:18,284
I listen to them.
I'm aware of that shit.

136
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:20,564
OK. That's true.
In his defense,

137
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,667
I must say that he paid me

138
00:07:22,922 --> 00:07:26,070
- tons of special attention in class.
- Not special.

139
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,489
No, Jackie.
He did not.

140
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:32,367
Jackie's writing's actually very good.
I read some of her short stories.

141
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,078
- You have.
- Yeah, sure I have.

142
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:36,874
I had to write her a recommendation
to the graduate writing program.

143
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,540
She couldn't very well ask you.

144
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,858
When is luncheon gonna be served?

145
00:07:41,018 --> 00:07:43,277
That's why we're here, right?
And I'm curious.

146
00:07:43,402 --> 00:07:46,048
I want to know how it's different
from actual lunch.

147
00:07:46,498 --> 00:07:49,634
We have one last guest,
who's a late arrival.

148
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,459
- Here's the latecomer now.
- It's not a lady. Please not a lady.

149
00:07:56,774 --> 00:07:58,102
Is that Richard Bates?

150
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,145
Yeah, <i>Crack the sky</i>, you know him?

151
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:02,564
- Know him?
- Yeah.

152
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:04,274
Karen, is that you?

153
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:08,529
You look exactly the same.

154
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,748
Exactly the same as what exactly?

155
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:12,282
I mean, even more beautiful.

156
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:15,342
I can picture you right now
standing under the arch

157
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:17,996
in Washington square park,
wind blowing your hair.

158
00:08:18,243 --> 00:08:20,164
And you blowing me off, you asshole.

159
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,403
Asshole...
I like where this is going,

160
00:08:22,528 --> 00:08:25,747
him being an asshole and all,
but you want to fill me in on

161
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:29,049
- the rest of this shit?
- You gave me a "c". I mean, like,

162
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,511
when you sleep with your professor,
isn't that, like, to get a "b"?

163
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,680
You slept with him?

164
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,099
The glorious "mangina" here?

165
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,185
This is my professor that I had
an affair with as an undergraduate.

166
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,520
I mean, I know it's, like,
100 years ago.

167
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,639
It feels just like yesterday.

168
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,224
- Worst day of my life.
- You look great.

169
00:08:47,349 --> 00:08:48,349
Thank you.

170
00:08:48,517 --> 00:08:51,822
- You're not with Bush league here?
- Fuck yeah, she... is.

171
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,991
- Well, kind of.
- Really?

172
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,704
Don't keep secrets
from the rest of the class.

173
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:01,748
You planted the seed...
that writer thing,

174
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,001
my attraction to writers.

175
00:09:05,718 --> 00:09:06,868
Have a drink.

176
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:10,214
How'd you snag her, anyway...

177
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,301
the old "I'm an agent" spiel?

178
00:09:12,821 --> 00:09:15,146
It's not a spiel.
I'm an agent.

179
00:09:15,505 --> 00:09:17,723
She has a dream, she's a waitress.

180
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,934
In your language,
it means stripper. She's a stripper.

181
00:09:21,943 --> 00:09:24,313
She is a cocktail waitress
with a screenplay.

182
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,169
An idea for a screenplay.

183
00:09:28,294 --> 00:09:30,235
Still, I see potential,
and I just...

184
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:32,779
Please. You see blow job.

185
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:36,240
Do I detect a note of jealousy?

186
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,621
Like I could be jealous
of a food-service professional

187
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,031
with an idea for a screenplay

188
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:45,709
- and her boobs.
- You are.

189
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:49,546
Marcy Runkle is jealous.
I never thought I'd see the day.

190
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:53,842
Go with God.
I got mine. Only right you get.

191
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:58,972
I have said all along.
I still love you.

192
00:10:00,258 --> 00:10:01,808
It's not what you say, Charlie.

193
00:10:02,192 --> 00:10:05,100
- What do you mean?
- It's out of sight, out of mind.

194
00:10:05,225 --> 00:10:06,825
See Marcy, want Marcy.

195
00:10:07,185 --> 00:10:09,358
No see Marcy, want boobies.

196
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,029
Really? Still?

197
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:17,866
- I forgot to change my ringtone.
- Please allow me.

198
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,284
Eat my bent wang, Rick Springfield.

199
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,330
Wait, get that.
It's Sharon.

200
00:10:28,785 --> 00:10:30,235
You're shitting me.

201
00:10:34,745 --> 00:10:36,095
We have an offer.

202
00:10:38,711 --> 00:10:40,973
Where were you off to
when you dumped me? Was it Nepal?

203
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,291
It was Egypt.

204
00:10:44,072 --> 00:10:46,937
I etched your name in stone
atop the pyramid at Giza.

205
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,273
- I wish that were true.
- Bullshit!

206
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,942
Staying home is very nice too.

207
00:10:52,296 --> 00:10:55,404
It's cozy.
You don't need a passport, no shots.

208
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:59,199
So overall you would recommend
to sleep with your teacher?

209
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,232
You see what you've gone and done?
You've set a bad example, woman.

210
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:03,704
You were just so sexy.

211
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,289
I can't exactly be judgmental,

212
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,083
because that is
how I met Chelsea's father.

213
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,110
I was in graduate school,

214
00:11:10,477 --> 00:11:12,796
and I took one
of his ridiculous civil war classes.

215
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,926
Loved to teach, you know,
so passionate about what he was doing.

216
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,433
That's it.
You were so passionate.

217
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:20,012
That's what turns me on.

218
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,892
Yes, but that kind of passion,
that burns you out.

219
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,167
That kind of intensity, <i>no bueno</i>.

220
00:11:26,731 --> 00:11:28,353
Look at him.
He's not burnt out.

221
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:30,605
The man had
a serious breakdown recently.

222
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:33,692
Public nudity and singing.

223
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:37,524
- Smuggling Dr. Johnson.
- Oh, my poor love.

224
00:11:38,336 --> 00:11:39,781
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

225
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:42,242
It was the best thing
that's happened to me in years.

226
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,785
For a man to be...

227
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,664
just broken down to his most naked,
most vulnerable self.

228
00:11:48,386 --> 00:11:51,376
Just stripped of all irony,
all vanity.

229
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:53,003
I don't think I've ever been

230
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,771
so deeply in touch
with my feminine side.

231
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,848
- That's beautiful.
- No, it wasn't. It was queer.

232
00:11:58,973 --> 00:12:01,511
And not queer as in gay...
It was queer as in odd.

233
00:12:01,877 --> 00:12:05,856
Downright lunatic, as a matter of fact.
I had to step in for him at that point

234
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:09,976
with my passion, my intensity,
'cause I'm all about that stuff.

235
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,964
The guy who once fell asleep
during his own lecture.

236
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:13,982
One time...

237
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,676
I did that one time.
I was boring myself,

238
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:19,422
and I thought it was an honest
reaction to actually fall asleep.

239
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,075
Word on the street is you couldn't
teach your way out of a paper bag.

240
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,843
Where'd you hear that?

241
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:27,954
I may have lobbed
a few random emails here and there.

242
00:12:30,551 --> 00:12:32,851
That sounds like Stacy.
That's odd.

243
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:35,431
Justice will be served!

244
00:12:39,482 --> 00:12:40,467
Ladies.

245
00:12:43,732 --> 00:12:46,223
I demand satisfaction.

246
00:12:46,997 --> 00:12:49,851
Well, general Sherman,
nice of you to join us.

247
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,863
William Tecumseh Sherman, no.

248
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:54,688
Yet another sign
of your blazing ignorance.

249
00:12:54,963 --> 00:12:57,054
Major general George Henry Thomas,

250
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:58,179
rock...

251
00:12:58,578 --> 00:12:59,820
of Chickamauga.

252
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,833
Pleased to make your acquaintance.
I don't know whether to shake your hand

253
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,450
- or to... your sword or...
- The day of reckoning is at hand.

254
00:13:05,969 --> 00:13:08,995
It's time for you to answer
for your sins. You and I will duel

255
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,613
on this fine day...

256
00:13:11,403 --> 00:13:12,290
Like men!

257
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:15,627
Men of what century?

258
00:13:15,883 --> 00:13:17,546
Dear God, he's completely blotto.

259
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:18,962
How can you tell?

260
00:13:19,087 --> 00:13:21,425
He must have gone out drinking
with those reenactment people.

261
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,719
- You mock me?
- Guilty.

262
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,012
I challenge you to a duel,
and this is how you respond?

263
00:13:26,663 --> 00:13:28,713
Personally, I love a good duel.

264
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:33,895
You're back and looking good.
Let's go, Moody.

265
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:35,897
You've defiled my wife.

266
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,732
You've brought dishonor
to this house,

267
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,108
the university.
I'll stand for it no more.

268
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:43,477
And get your filthy car
out of my driveway.

269
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:48,076
Stacy, you might want to rest up.
Hank doesn't want to play these games.

270
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,670
- Hank don't want to play.
- They always lose, you see.

271
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:53,888
The union army gets defeated,
and then they go out drinking.

272
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:57,961
He held until nightfall,
preventing an even greater union defeat.

273
00:13:58,224 --> 00:14:01,660
How? Because general Thomas
refused to surrender Horseshoe Ridge.

274
00:14:01,785 --> 00:14:04,285
Was he the flashiest
civil war general?

275
00:14:05,774 --> 00:14:07,471
Did he impress the ladies?

276
00:14:08,271 --> 00:14:11,821
Was he a highly functioning
alcoholic like Ulysses S. Grant?

277
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:13,635
Maybe.

278
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,024
You know, you might want
to play along with him.

279
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:22,694
And let him bust
civil war-era cap in my ass?

280
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:23,904
I don't think so.

281
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,239
They're just blanks.
You won't feel anything.

282
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,537
- General?
- I'll be waiting in the field of valor.

283
00:14:34,501 --> 00:14:36,153
For love and honor!

284
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,252
It's really quite fun.

285
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:43,921
We're gonna sell this house.

286
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:50,058
- To moving on.
- And to my favorite roommate.

287
00:14:51,046 --> 00:14:53,535
And just think, we don't have
to be roommates anymore.

288
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,812
You can fuck whoever you want,
however you want.

289
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,480
Cowgirl, reverse cowgirl,
downward facing dog, whatevs.

290
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,651
I think that's a yoga term.

291
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,322
It is both a sex term
and a yoga term.

292
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:08,441
- I learned that from Rick Springfield.
- Please don't tell me any more.

293
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,202
That's the beauty of it.
I fuck who I want,

294
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,608
you fuck who you want,

295
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:16,122
and we don't have to discuss
the details.

296
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,918
I don't have to hear all your shit
about your pieces of class up the ass.

297
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,754
You know, not to go back on this,
but you actually did

298
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,256
offer me the ass one time,

299
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:27,634
- right here in this very living room.
- What was I thinking?

300
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:31,352
Dr. Drew says you could get
a prolapsed anus from that shit.

301
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:33,677
Once you hit 80, your ass is like,

302
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,069
"Why did you have to take it
in the pooper?

303
00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:38,701
"Now you're gonna have to carry
me around with you all day."

304
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:41,185
And right over here?

305
00:15:41,515 --> 00:15:44,693
The year that I got that UTK bonus,
remember? I came in.

306
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:46,554
I bent you over the couch and...

307
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,573
And gave me the worst
back pain I've ever experienced.

308
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:53,091
For years, I had a man
who liked to take it

309
00:15:53,216 --> 00:15:56,079
out of the comfortable bedroom,
take it on the road.

310
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,181
- Great.
- That's right.

311
00:16:00,303 --> 00:16:03,365
We really have humped
all over this house, haven't we?

312
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,589
Remember
the kitchen-counter encounter?

313
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:08,216
- Best night of my life.
- Not mine.

314
00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:11,720
Days later, I was still finding
crumbs in my folds.

315
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:13,471
What about the powder room?

316
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:15,329
We never did it there.

317
00:16:15,454 --> 00:16:16,516
That's true.

318
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:19,644
There's one room in this house
that was spared our unholy alliance.

319
00:16:20,508 --> 00:16:21,605
Okay, let's go.

320
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,315
- Let's go, come on.
- Where? What?

321
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,233
We can't leave one room uninitiated.

322
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,406
We cannot leave that room pristine,

323
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:30,594
because that would be a tragedy,
and this is a happy day. Let's go.

324
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,156
You move it, schoolgirl.
You... Come on, let's go.

325
00:16:33,281 --> 00:16:36,536
- No, you can't tell me what to do.
- Daddy's coming!

326
00:16:36,931 --> 00:16:39,939
- You sure these aren't loaded?
- Oh, just pick one, Moody.

327
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:43,376
- So ten paces and then turn?
- I don't believe I have ever met

328
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,919
a bigger pussy in my life.

329
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,882
You slept with the man's wife?
The code of honor demands it.

330
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,760
What do you know
about honor, numb nuts?

331
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:51,787
Silence.

332
00:16:51,912 --> 00:16:54,143
I'll have none of that filthy talk
on this field of valor.

333
00:16:54,268 --> 00:16:55,268
My bad.

334
00:16:55,393 --> 00:16:57,349
This is quite fun, Chels, isn't it?

335
00:16:57,578 --> 00:16:59,743
Like the good old days
when we used to follow your father

336
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:01,770
around from battlefield
to battlefield.

337
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,390
Ladies...

338
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,274
- Come on.
- Start your egos.

339
00:17:08,835 --> 00:17:11,279
For fuck's sake, Moody,
stop fucking around.

340
00:17:11,538 --> 00:17:12,538
Come on!

341
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:17,411
Come on, let's do this thing.

342
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,995
- Come on.
- Come on, let's go.

343
00:17:19,545 --> 00:17:22,207
- There, stand there.
- I hope he shoots him between the eyes.

344
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,948
You're not getting out of this one.

345
00:17:24,073 --> 00:17:27,128
I'll let that slide
since this isn't a real duel.

346
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,788
One, two, five, six...

347
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:32,966
... nine, ten.

348
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:39,140
Damn it to hell.
Well, Moody, take your shot.

349
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,958
Wait, you want me to shoot you?
Nah, it's all right. I'm good.

350
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,982
I demand that you shoot me.

351
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,862
No can do.
This whole thing is way too gay for me.

352
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,116
Hold on a second.

353
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:53,646
You fucked the man's wife,
and now you refuse to shoot him?

354
00:17:53,771 --> 00:17:55,990
You know something,
if it's all the same to you...

355
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,206
Is this what's supposed to happen?

356
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,334
Cool down, girls.

357
00:18:10,075 --> 00:18:11,423
I guess I deserved that.

358
00:18:13,618 --> 00:18:14,467
I'm sorry.

359
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,583
- I apologize.
- No biggie.

360
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,230
No, it was ungentlemanly of me.

361
00:18:19,873 --> 00:18:22,920
The purpose of a duel
is to fight with honor

362
00:18:23,385 --> 00:18:24,519
and decorum.

363
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,341
Nice one, Dean.

364
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:31,686
- You liked that?
- Yes, I did.

365
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:34,126
You know something?
You offend my honor.

366
00:18:34,251 --> 00:18:36,031
You offend my lady's honor.

367
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,124
Your lady?

368
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,159
Are you so sure she's really yours?

369
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:41,703
Shit, Moody, you couldn't own
a woman like that.

370
00:18:42,008 --> 00:18:45,480
Christ, I still remember the sound
of her approaching climax...

371
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:47,631
Fucking choir of angels.

372
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,177
I can't tell
if they're joking or not.

373
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,526
I think they're actually fighting.

374
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:07,036
Can I take you up on that drink?

375
00:19:12,464 --> 00:19:13,764
Fuck your pussy.

376
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:16,154
- Fuck your pussy.
- Fuck my pussy?

377
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:18,156
Or your pussy is my pussy, or...

378
00:19:18,443 --> 00:19:19,993
Shut up and pound me.

379
00:19:26,616 --> 00:19:27,616
My back.

380
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,084
Holy mother of fuck!

381
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,297
Why did I let you sit on the sink?
The chick is supposed to sit.

382
00:19:35,422 --> 00:19:37,425
That's bathroom boning 101!

383
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,511
I can't move,
I'm fucking drowning here.

384
00:19:39,841 --> 00:19:41,471
You're drowning, really?

385
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,140
A person can drown in this amount
of water in certain circumstances.

386
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,020
You big baby.

387
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,398
Get over here.

388
00:19:55,431 --> 00:19:57,181
Climbing the toilet bowl.

389
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,097
- We're almost home.
- Sit, sit.

390
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:03,618
Wait.

391
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,145
What the fuck is that?

392
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,957
You had my name tattooed
above your ass crack?

393
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,543
I was drunk.
I don't even remember getting it done.

394
00:20:13,224 --> 00:20:16,224
- I'm getting it removed. I am.
- No, you're not.

395
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,717
- You like it?
- No, I don't like it.

396
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,485
It's fucking retarded.

397
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:24,149
Retarded and sweet...

398
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,559
Just like you, Runkle.

399
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,780
I guess I'd better take
my walking wounded home, right?

400
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,234
That's if he ever
comes out of the bathroom.

401
00:20:38,927 --> 00:20:42,448
Are you... Are you okay
with Becca spending the night?

402
00:20:43,016 --> 00:20:45,011
Yeah, of course.
It's no problem.

403
00:20:45,136 --> 00:20:48,413
You know, it's nice for the girls
to spend one last sleepover together

404
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,415
before Becca leaves for New York.

405
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,170
- Good luck with that, by the way.
- Thank you.

406
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:57,617
Are you always so civilized?

407
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:01,801
The wife of a general
has certain responsibilities,

408
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,719
- you know?
- Of course.

409
00:21:06,459 --> 00:21:08,909
I'll never be
as pretty as I once was.

410
00:21:09,297 --> 00:21:10,435
And I'm peeing blood.

411
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:12,979
I got myself
more of a foot soldier...

412
00:21:13,292 --> 00:21:14,939
Some cannon fodder, really.

413
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,617
What did I miss?

414
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:20,804
What did I miss?

415
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,108
Look at that.

416
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,622
One semester ends, another begins.

417
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,818
- You gonna do something about that?
- What's the point, you know?

418
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,543
Nothing ever really changes around here.
It's the beautiful thing about academia.

419
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:38,701
None of us can really function
in the real world,

420
00:21:38,826 --> 00:21:42,469
so that's why we end up here.
It sort of works for everyone, really.

421
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:45,036
We can't function
anywhere else but here.

422
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:46,161
You can't.

423
00:21:47,312 --> 00:21:48,381
No, you can't.

424
00:21:48,506 --> 00:21:50,219
- Ignore him.
- What's he saying?

425
00:21:51,071 --> 00:21:53,355
Okay, I'm gonna go say
good night to Richard.

426
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,680
No, you can't.

427
00:21:56,056 --> 00:21:58,806
- Go. I'm timing you.
- Thank you for lunch.

428
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,153
I hope we didn't give you
too hard a time of it today.

429
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,835
No, no worries.
I'm fine.

430
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,061
My ass is a little sore,
but that's normal for me.

431
00:22:07,186 --> 00:22:08,826
It's all done with great affection.

432
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,247
You're a mess, you cause such chaos,
but I wouldn't change anything.

433
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:14,040
- You sure about that?
- Really.

434
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,000
It was a fabulous disaster.

435
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,835
Come here.

436
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,921
- Be happy in New York.
- There you go.

437
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,131
And the general?
You gonna let him back?

438
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,300
If you don't,
he's gonna call in reinforcements...

439
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,018
The cavalry, perhaps.

440
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,337
He does seem very determined.

441
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,670
Passionate, one might say.

442
00:22:30,942 --> 00:22:32,642
I do like that in a man.

443
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,920
- I'm in a fever!
- I better go tend to the general.

444
00:22:38,294 --> 00:22:39,780
- Toodle-loo.
- Toodle-loo.

445
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:41,161
My brow!

446
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,905
Did you ladies have fun
twisting the knife this afternoon?

447
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,563
- Absolutely.
- Too much fun.

448
00:22:49,688 --> 00:22:53,538
I'm so happy that I could
give you a reason to come together

449
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:57,085
- and become friends.
- Yeah, we're like BFFs now.

450
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,009
She's gonna teach me
how to pole-dance.

451
00:22:59,134 --> 00:23:00,861
Such a crying shame, Hank.

452
00:23:00,986 --> 00:23:03,423
Just think of all
of the missed opportunities.

453
00:23:10,343 --> 00:23:11,556
If I hear you've gone

454
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:15,165
and blown it with this gorgeous filly,
I will kick your ass

455
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,890
and make her my queen.

456
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:18,563
Ladies.

457
00:23:19,238 --> 00:23:21,963
- Take care, Karen.
- Bye, have fun.

458
00:23:22,482 --> 00:23:23,482
Bye.

459
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:27,783
- I can't believe I used to love him.
- You'll get over it.

460
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:29,975
Come on, soldier,
let's get you home.

461
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,714
You still have battles to fight,
realms to conquer.

462
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:34,939
The child...

463
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:36,823
What about the child?

464
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:39,148
The child is staying here tonight.

465
00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:51,471
No wonder we never did it
in the powder room.

466
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,973
That was really not pleasant at all.

467
00:23:54,747 --> 00:23:56,240
It wasn't great.

468
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,482
I don't mean the first part, of course.
I meant the second part.

469
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:01,731
I enjoyed the shit
out of humping you at first.

470
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,072
We could sleep

471
00:24:03,197 --> 00:24:06,736
knowing we gave the next homeowners
a dirty sink and a plumbing problem.

472
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,418
Holy shit.

473
00:24:13,206 --> 00:24:14,306
They came...

474
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,529
The divorce papers.

475
00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:23,183
Big day, Charlie...

476
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:24,670
Signing time.

477
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:28,341
Well, I can't move.
You're gonna have to bring me a pen.

478
00:24:37,427 --> 00:24:39,852
Hey, how was the first part
for you, Marce, hmm?

479
00:24:40,209 --> 00:24:41,434
You never said.

480
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:43,309
What do you want me to say, Charlie?

481
00:24:43,434 --> 00:24:45,615
The first part with you was great.

482
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,152
It's the last part
that ended in disaster.

483
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,155
Yeah, yeah, but it doesn't have to,
you know?

484
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,116
Because we could keep going.

485
00:24:54,495 --> 00:24:58,830
You know, we turn the last part
into the middle part.

486
00:24:59,126 --> 00:25:02,041
And what happens when we get
to the next shitty part?

487
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:04,627
There doesn't have to be
a shitty part.

488
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:10,121
There's always
a shitty part with us.

489
00:25:42,738 --> 00:25:45,118
I appreciate the interest,
I really do.

490
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:46,933
- You do?
- Yes, I'm just...

491
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:50,038
I'm just not sure I'm...

492
00:25:51,052 --> 00:25:52,381
in the Moody.

493
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:56,637
But I am.
I really am.

494
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,391
I mean, today was so exciting.
I could, like, totally just, like,

495
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:02,674
carry on from where
we left off this morning.

496
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,688
My mind and my body
are totally in sync.

497
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:09,192
I'm not sure that I like
the implication of that.

498
00:26:10,046 --> 00:26:13,311
What? It's very sexy for a man
to fight for your honor.

499
00:26:13,436 --> 00:26:15,707
Is it also very sexy to run
into some old geezer

500
00:26:15,832 --> 00:26:17,867
you let bone you
when you were 19 years old?

501
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:20,795
It just reminded me
of being back at college again,

502
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,497
when life was so simple,
and he was so...

503
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,415
He was so passionate,
so full of enthusiasm.

504
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,752
I know, I know.

505
00:26:28,908 --> 00:26:30,671
He was so big, actually.

506
00:26:31,751 --> 00:26:32,610
Gross.

507
00:26:32,735 --> 00:26:35,715
I mean, not that that matters
or anything, but...

508
00:26:36,212 --> 00:26:37,372
You know, right?

509
00:26:37,497 --> 00:26:39,430
- You saw. The whole deal.
- I saw nothing.

510
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,016
As far as I know,
the man is a hermaphrodite.

511
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:42,986
Really?

512
00:26:43,111 --> 00:26:47,522
God, he was, like, the hottest
assistant professor on the campus.

513
00:26:48,584 --> 00:26:51,150
Everybody wanted to sleep with him.
My friends were so jealous.

514
00:26:51,418 --> 00:26:55,238
One time we were doing it in his office,
and there was, like, this line

515
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:56,989
- down the hall...
- That's it.

516
00:26:57,335 --> 00:27:00,335
- I demand satisfaction.
- Yes, yes, it worked!

517
00:27:00,848 --> 00:27:03,537
Good.
Are you gonna punish me?

518
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,832
You do know I'll have to live
with that image for the rest of my life.

519
00:27:07,257 --> 00:27:08,334
I know.

520
00:27:11,267 --> 00:27:14,917
I'm just not sure that my mind
and my body are in sync either.

521
00:27:15,392 --> 00:27:19,779
The events of the day, all this fun
you've had, it's bruised my mind.

522
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:21,404
It's traumatized me.

523
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:24,558
It may very well undermine
my ability to please you.

524
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,726
Really?

525
00:27:27,703 --> 00:27:28,953
No, not really.
