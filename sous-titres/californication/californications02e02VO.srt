<i>Previously on</i> Californication...

2
00:00:01,983 --> 00:00:04,406
I can't believe you made me get
a vasectomy.

3
00:00:04,667 --> 00:00:07,064
- What do you know about it?
- I know you fucked and punched him,

4
00:00:07,406 --> 00:00:09,311
set him up, stole his book.

5
00:00:09,572 --> 00:00:11,001
What are you gonna do about it?

6
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:14,483
- You guys are officially back together?
- Until we fuck it up.

7
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,840
We're going to this party
up in Laurel Canyon.

8
00:00:19,049 --> 00:00:20,021
What the fuck!

9
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:22,992
I leave you alone for 2 seconds.
You're not supposed to do that.

10
00:00:23,254 --> 00:00:25,261
- What are you doing?
- Assuming the posish.

11
00:00:25,795 --> 00:00:26,962
I'll be right back.

12
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:40,109
Lew, this fucking perv just tried
to mouthrape me.

13
00:00:40,279 --> 00:00:43,033
- I accidently went down on her.
- How is that possible ?

14
00:00:43,816 --> 00:00:45,920
- Have you been drinking, sir?
- Hours ago...

15
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,300
Out of the car.

16
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,019
Why don't you just mind
your own fucking buisiness?

17

18
00:01:12,111 --> 00:01:13,163
Silent treament?

19
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:14,580
Yes.

20
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:17,728
- How long?
- Hard to say.

21
00:01:18,043 --> 00:01:20,707
You think we can skip the part
where I apologize profusely

22
00:01:20,877 --> 00:01:22,906
and tell you
what a lame parental figure I am?

23
00:01:23,703 --> 00:01:24,486
No.

24
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,189
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

25
00:01:27,728 --> 00:01:28,512
Me too.

26
00:01:29,235 --> 00:01:30,359
Why are you sorry?

27
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,728
Because we're not bailing you out.

28
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,497
- You shitting me?
- I shit you not.

29
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:38,734
Mom says you should
use this time to think.

30
00:01:39,052 --> 00:01:41,103
About what? How much my balls ache?

31
00:01:41,483 --> 00:01:42,838
What about Mom's heart?

32
00:01:43,287 --> 00:01:45,174
Don't you think that aches a bit too?

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,579
<i>Touché</i>, daughter.

34
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,509
Check it out.

35
00:01:54,253 --> 00:01:55,625
You're on the*****

36
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:03,202
- It's a pretty good picture.
- I thought so.

37
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,322
I'll work on her.

38
00:02:13,809 --> 00:02:15,067
In the meantime,

39
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,406
don't bend over for the soap.

40
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,078
- What's the occasion?
- Do we need an occasion?

41
00:03:12,248 --> 00:03:14,053
Life is good, business is better.

42
00:03:14,223 --> 00:03:16,599
Let's party while this bitch
can still get wet!

43
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:18,426
You guys are great together.

44
00:03:18,596 --> 00:03:20,800
Baby, tonight we are kicking it
old school.

45
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,372
Condoms, coke and lobster claws.

46
00:03:23,795 --> 00:03:24,940
Meet me after work.

47
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:27,430
I reserved our favorite room.

48
00:03:27,735 --> 00:03:29,978
- Marce...
- Don't "marce" me, short bus.

49
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,945
Turn over. I got to get your tail.

50
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,441
You don't want me to step outside?

51
00:03:38,615 --> 00:03:40,936
Please, I've had way grosser dudes than you

52
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:43,485
staring into the busines end of my cudra all day long.

53
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:44,694
Porn.

54
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:46,049
Thanks, got it.

55
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:48,325
- How's that working for you?
- I don't know.

56
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:49,848
I mean, I love it, I do.

57
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:52,841
But I'm just not getting
the kind of jobs I really want.

58
00:03:53,011 --> 00:03:56,048
You gotta be careful, one wrong move
and you end up the asslicker.

59
00:03:57,163 --> 00:03:58,640
Unloath to ask.

60
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:01,543
You're watching some porn,
and there is two girls and a guy.

61
00:04:01,883 --> 00:04:04,454
One girl, she's clearly the star,
but the other one...

62
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:08,171
She ends up tonging the dude's balloon knot while he fucks the shit out of the leading lady.

63
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,520
That's why I'm afraid of:
chocolate starfish duty.

64
00:04:13,851 --> 00:04:15,579
You're far too pretty for such things.

65
00:04:15,752 --> 00:04:17,280
- You really think so?
- I do.

66
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:19,828
You could cross over.
Go mainstream. I've seen it happen.

67
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:21,457
Don't tell her that.

68
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:24,433
Don't fill her pretty little head
full of Hollywood bullshit.

69
00:04:24,695 --> 00:04:27,101
She does what she does
and she's good at it.

70
00:04:27,326 --> 00:04:28,462
That's the secret.

71
00:04:28,632 --> 00:04:31,419
You find your fucking niche
and you stick to it.

72
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,776
Like me: I could branch out.
I could diversify.

73
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,713
But no! I wax hairy tacos.

74
00:04:38,163 --> 00:04:41,116
Maybe I bleech an asshole or two.
That's my thing.

75
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,685
One wrong move,
you end up the asslicker.

76
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:45,801
Words to live by.

77
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:47,210
Give me some.

78
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:51,844
Yeah, Charlie Runkle.

79
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:55,401
No, he's not at a meeting,
He hates meetings. Come on.

80
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:56,757
Try his cell.

81
00:04:57,394 --> 00:05:00,467
Don't hang up, listen. Tell him Hank Moody called.
Tell him they set bail.

82
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:02,246
Just...

83
00:05:04,483 --> 00:05:05,494
One more.

84
00:05:06,213 --> 00:05:07,664
I'm trying to reach my agent.

85
00:05:08,138 --> 00:05:11,436
Maybe you should think about
new representation, homie.

86
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:13,448
Everybody is a fucking comedian.

87
00:05:21,207 --> 00:05:22,875
What the fuck?

88
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:28,063
What?

89
00:05:28,873 --> 00:05:30,132
You touched my ass.

90
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:33,168
Not my thing man, trust me.

91
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:39,901
My sweet sexy ass,
and you touched it.

92
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:44,000
Can't say I blame you.

93
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:46,202
What are you on?
I want some.

94
00:05:59,314 --> 00:06:00,696
Now you're looking at it.

95
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:03,386
You're not giving me a whole lot
of choice in the matter, are you?

96
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,060
A beauty, ain't it?

97
00:06:06,095 --> 00:06:08,620
This nice white mid-crowd ass of mine.

98
00:06:08,973 --> 00:06:11,640
There's no place like home,
there's no place like home.

99
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,620
Prisoner coming in on the gates.

100
00:06:30,854 --> 00:06:31,654
You?

101
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:34,167
I know you.

102
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,603
Last night.

103
00:06:35,723 --> 00:06:38,351
The whole cunilingus switcharoo
incident.

104
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:39,970
- Right!
- Mouthrape!

105
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:42,951
That chick?

106
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:45,358
Stone freak.
I ended up banging these other two.

107
00:06:45,518 --> 00:06:48,528
She flips out, calls the cops,
cries domestic abuse.

108
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,235
I'm pretty sure I never
laid a hand on her.

109
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:54,734
Lew Ashby.

110
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:56,269
Hank Moody.

111
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,609
The writer?

112
00:07:03,938 --> 00:07:06,379
- So how's the script coming?
- Really good!

113
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,775
I don't see what the big deal is.
Screenplays are easy.

114
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:14,104
- What's hard is adapting your own work.
- Sure, sure, I would imagine.

115
00:07:14,314 --> 00:07:17,724
I bet you just look at those pages
sometimes and have no idea

116
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:19,896
where all that brilliance came from.

117
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:24,230
As one of my agents, I would think
you'd be a whole lot nicer to me.

118
00:07:24,571 --> 00:07:27,278
- I would think so too.
- You know what? Ladies, just

119
00:07:27,398 --> 00:07:29,635
don't gang bang up on me, please.

120
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:33,005
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
You sweaty little perv.

121
00:07:34,841 --> 00:07:36,172
I've got a meeting.

122
00:07:36,895 --> 00:07:40,813
Good luck. Just be yourself
and a little cleavage is always good.

123
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:42,273
Done, and...

124
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,583
done.

125
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:45,752
Don't you have a school to attend,
somewhere?

126
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:49,000
If it's all the same to you,, I think
I'd rather sit down with David Finsher.

127
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,149
Word of advice:
if he's about to cum,

128
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:54,484
just let him cum.
Don't punch the poor guy in the face.

129
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:55,404
Dick.

130
00:07:59,616 --> 00:08:02,305
- What's your problem?
- She's an important client.

131
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:05,125
- Not to me.
- She is to me and the agency.

132
00:08:05,245 --> 00:08:07,707
She is everything that's wrong
with Hollywood right now.

133
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:09,521
Much like youself.

134
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:12,979
- How the mighty have fallen.
- What's that supposed to mean?

135
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,051
You've gone soft, Charlie.

136
00:08:15,535 --> 00:08:18,284
You lost that killer instinct
I used to admire so much.

137
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:21,136
I see, you've been an agent now for...
What is it? 3 whole months.

138
00:08:21,256 --> 00:08:24,290
- You got it all figured out now?
- I love what I do. I know that much.

139
00:08:24,534 --> 00:08:27,660
Blackmailing your way into a career
doesn't make you a good agent.

140
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:32,627
- No, just a successful one.
- I'm sorry I ever spanked you.

141
00:08:34,103 --> 00:08:34,993
I'm not.

142
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,361
I miss you, boss.

143
00:08:42,237 --> 00:08:43,636
I miss our little...

144
00:08:45,263 --> 00:08:46,236
playdates.

145
00:08:57,114 --> 00:08:58,591
Wrong move, Charlie.

146
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:01,427
Wow you are just totally
bad shit crazy now, aren't you?

147
00:09:03,954 --> 00:09:05,260
A year from now,

148
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:08,634
when you're selling BMWs in the Valley,

149
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:12,368
- remember this moment.
- I've had enough of this, alright?

150
00:09:12,488 --> 00:09:14,878
It's time I go have
a little chat with our president.

151
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:16,968
He's had his share of psycho
hose bag assistants.

152
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:18,845
I'm thinking he's gonna have my back.

153
00:09:19,248 --> 00:09:20,746
Don't go there, Charlie.

154
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:24,059
Instead, maybe it's time
to think about doing something

155
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:26,454
a little bit different
with your skill set.

156
00:09:26,574 --> 00:09:27,920
What about producing?

157
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,890
The only thing I'd like to produce
right now is a fist up your ass.

158
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,593
Once upon a time
I might have taken you up on that.

159
00:09:35,745 --> 00:09:37,060
Good luck, boss.

160
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,108
You've got a lot of fans
in the music business.

161
00:09:45,648 --> 00:09:46,668
Ah? Yeah?

162
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:49,130
Your writing always had this

163
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,454
"in your face rock and roll energy"
to it.

164
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:53,954
Dolorès Thomson
meets the last Stoogees on.

165
00:09:54,812 --> 00:09:57,557
God hates us all.
How was your Gatsby?

166
00:09:58,095 --> 00:10:00,478
- What happened to you, man?
- What happened to me?

167
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:04,969
I came out here from New York
to fight the good fight.

168
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:07,298
I lost.
This fucking city happened to me.

169
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:09,462
Please. All you haters can go

170
00:10:09,622 --> 00:10:12,193
fellate yourselves.
I mean, always whining about L.A.

171
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:15,801
and how New York is like a holy land.
Go the fuck move back there.

172
00:10:16,103 --> 00:10:19,329
The sheer amount of talent in this town,
any given time?

173
00:10:19,723 --> 00:10:22,594
Mind-boggling. That caveman over there,
farting in his sleep?

174
00:10:22,714 --> 00:10:25,573
One of the greatest
rock n' roll guitar players of all time.

175
00:10:27,884 --> 00:10:29,065
I got a...

176
00:10:29,664 --> 00:10:31,461
I got this book deal.

177
00:10:32,471 --> 00:10:34,474
You wanna write about
why everything I touch

178
00:10:34,594 --> 00:10:37,592
turns to gold or platinum,
zirconium or some sick shit

179
00:10:37,712 --> 00:10:41,421
*** is trying to push these dweeby
Rolling Stone writers on me?

180
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:44,370
You'll write it.

181
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:46,299
Be my buzz well.

182
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,303
Slow down, there, charm school.
I don't put out on the first date.

183
00:10:50,463 --> 00:10:53,940
I'm not trying to put in your pale,
I got instincts about these things.

184
00:10:54,418 --> 00:10:56,489
Yeah, but I'm one of the haters.

185
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:59,220
I'm actually doing something about it.
I'm moving back to Mecca.

186
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,828
Bullshit, not going anywhere.
You took a swing at a cop,

187
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:03,981
- you need a bucket lawyer.
- Ashby!

188
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:06,285
A good lawyer is everything.
I got a great one.

189
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,455
Good hanging with you Moody

190
00:11:09,615 --> 00:11:11,457
- Ashby!
- Get writing again.

191
00:11:11,826 --> 00:11:12,647
Peace.

192
00:11:15,035 --> 00:11:16,079
Thank you.

193
00:11:25,576 --> 00:11:29,028
Okay, look. I know I'm supposed
to be like a sister here, but...

194
00:11:29,198 --> 00:11:31,113
not like he did it on purpose.

195
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:32,493
Sonia,

196
00:11:33,248 --> 00:11:36,348
you slept with the father of my child
in my very own bed

197
00:11:36,518 --> 00:11:40,335
and then you vomited all over it.
I would never accuse you of being a sister.

198
00:11:40,597 --> 00:11:43,559
- You hooked me up with him so I mean...
- What was I thinking?

199
00:11:43,729 --> 00:11:45,254
I'm sorry about the comforter.

200
00:11:46,194 --> 00:11:47,108
You ready?

201
00:11:47,652 --> 00:11:48,463
For what?

202
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:50,378
My pitch.

203
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,348
What are you, peddling screenplays now ?

204
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,768
God, no.

205
00:11:55,202 --> 00:11:56,155
I think we

206
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:58,306
should go into business together.

207
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,322
I'm flattered, really.

208
00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:02,786
Thank you. But this is a...

209
00:12:03,386 --> 00:12:07,062
This is kind of a hard time for me
right now. The house is on the market,

210
00:12:07,324 --> 00:12:09,081
and I'm interviewing for jobs and...

211
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,585
How would you feel

212
00:12:10,854 --> 00:12:13,468
about restoring an original *Locke* house with me?

213
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:16,419
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm not.

214
00:12:17,812 --> 00:12:19,307
I'm bidding on one tomorrow.

215
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:21,904
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

216
00:12:23,933 --> 00:12:26,055
I got some things to say to you.
Some of it ugly,

217
00:12:26,175 --> 00:12:27,984
some of it embarrassing,
but all of it true.

218
00:12:28,104 --> 00:12:30,245
I am not going down without a fight.

219
00:12:56,306 --> 00:12:57,356
So... what?

220
00:12:58,218 --> 00:13:00,121
You're gonna shitcan
15 years of experience

221
00:13:00,241 --> 00:13:02,017
because a guy messes up one time?

222
00:13:29,682 --> 00:13:32,747
Okay, that's it! I'm ankling!

223
00:13:34,311 --> 00:13:35,540
Runkle is ankling!

224
00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:48,868
Okay, Becca? Dinner.

225
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:53,022
What are you up to, young lady?

226
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:56,104
How long are you going to let my father
rot in jail?

227
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,642
Look, I know this is hard for you.

228
00:14:01,414 --> 00:14:03,645
But your father has to understand

229
00:14:03,907 --> 00:14:06,278
that there are consequences
to his actions, OK?

230
00:14:06,448 --> 00:14:08,057
He can't just go around saying

231
00:14:08,227 --> 00:14:10,985
and doing exactly what he wants
at all times.

232
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:12,785
I mean, you get that, right?

233
00:14:17,387 --> 00:14:18,426
- Hey!
- Hey!

234
00:14:19,922 --> 00:14:21,349
- What's this?
- Galley proofs.

235
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:25,296
Once upon a time, before you humiliated
my father on his wedding night,

236
00:14:25,602 --> 00:14:28,548
you promised to read my book.
High time I collect, don't you think?

237
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:30,338
You're right, I did, and I will.

238
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:32,045
I wanna read it.

239
00:14:32,902 --> 00:14:35,543
I think this one might be
a little too NC-17, for you, Juno.

240
00:14:36,741 --> 00:14:38,409
What are you talking about?

241
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:41,449
I've read all my father's books,
I'm sure I can handle yours.

242
00:14:43,201 --> 00:14:45,220
Where is the esteemed author
this evening?

243
00:14:46,522 --> 00:14:47,909
In the big house.

244
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,727
Jail. He's in jail.

245
00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:56,297
- No shit. What did he do?
- I'm not allowed to know.

246
00:14:57,044 --> 00:15:00,485
Because I don't wanna turn you
off men for the rest of your life.

247
00:15:00,798 --> 00:15:03,768
What are we gonna do? Shouldn't we be
calling Chico's Bail Bonds?

248
00:15:03,938 --> 00:15:07,342
- Mom thinks he needs time to think.
- He does need time.

249
00:15:07,604 --> 00:15:10,189
What if all he's thinking is
some cholo tosses his salad?

250
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,044
Mia.

251
00:15:11,574 --> 00:15:13,014
What does that mean?

252
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,736
Nothing good.

253
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,137
I gotta say I don't approve
of this course of action.

254
00:15:18,257 --> 00:15:21,460
For all his faults, Hank's a lover.
Not a fighter.

255
00:15:21,851 --> 00:15:23,825
And he's far too pretty for jail, mom.

256
00:15:24,505 --> 00:15:26,281
What if he's someone's bitch right now?

257
00:15:26,731 --> 00:15:28,396
Instead of being yours?

258
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:32,375
That is not fair... Or nice.

259
00:15:32,652 --> 00:15:34,423
He is who he is, Mom.

260
00:15:34,593 --> 00:15:37,095
You knew that
when you jumped into the car with us.

261
00:15:37,265 --> 00:15:40,408
If you're worried you made a mistake,
that's not his fault.

262
00:15:41,255 --> 00:15:43,523
You have to love him for who he is.

263
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,014
And not his potential.

264
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,719
No, no, sweetie.

265
00:15:54,883 --> 00:15:55,685
Shit.

266
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:58,922
- Could you watch her?
- Sure.

267
00:15:59,186 --> 00:16:01,286
- Where are you going?
- To bail him out.

268
00:16:01,456 --> 00:16:02,463
Because that

269
00:16:02,855 --> 00:16:03,835
is the...

270
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:06,206
infuriating magic of Hank.

271
00:16:07,452 --> 00:16:10,041
You can never stay mad at him
for very long.

272
00:16:10,455 --> 00:16:11,655
I'll be back

273
00:16:11,825 --> 00:16:13,047
with the Hank.

274
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:18,761
Dude?

275
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:21,780
You ate the wrong pussy.
That's all there is to it.

276
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,644
That shit is fucked up.

277
00:16:24,243 --> 00:16:25,307
Beyond fucked up.

278
00:16:25,683 --> 00:16:26,408
Fuck!

279
00:16:26,975 --> 00:16:29,029
If I got a caught munching
the wrong rug,

280
00:16:29,518 --> 00:16:31,546
the woman would go all Lorena Bobbitt
on my ass.

281
00:16:31,978 --> 00:16:33,328
My sweet sexy ass.

282
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:35,230
Moody! You're out of here.

283
00:16:37,282 --> 00:16:39,000
Gentlemen... Lady...

284
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,923
It's been a slice. Let's keep in touch.

285
00:16:47,075 --> 00:16:49,311
- You?
- That's right, motherfucker.

286
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:53,615
- Why the fuck would you bail me out?
- Why the fuck not?

287
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:56,684
- It's mighty white of you.
- It's only money.

288
00:16:57,124 --> 00:16:58,871
Now, you got to drink with me.

289
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:02,124
I hate to seem unappreciative,
but I got some girls back home

290
00:17:02,294 --> 00:17:05,133
who deserve the full-court press
on this one so I'm gonna have to pass.

291
00:17:05,302 --> 00:17:07,415
Come on.
One drink and then, I'll drop you off.

292
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:08,799
One.

293
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,120
Come on.

294
00:17:11,294 --> 00:17:12,967
Yes. Silence is a yes.

295
00:17:20,701 --> 00:17:22,175
Oh, my balls...

296
00:17:31,714 --> 00:17:32,897
Take a whiff...

297
00:17:33,871 --> 00:17:35,856
Smell the history.
This was Led Zeppelin's table.

298
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:39,343
Jimmy fucking Page used to get
under-the-table oral from Miss Pamela

299
00:17:39,646 --> 00:17:40,562
right here.

300
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:43,532
I bet you could still scrape
some of his DNA off the floor.

301
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:46,154
First album I ever bought
with my own money. Zeppelin II.

302
00:17:46,437 --> 00:17:49,018
You had good taste.
Mine was Captain and Tennille.

303
00:17:49,188 --> 00:17:51,678
- I was a homo until I heard the hard stuff.
- Indeed.

304
00:17:52,055 --> 00:17:53,094
Want a blow job?

305
00:17:53,544 --> 00:17:55,563
I think that might ruin the friendship.

306
00:17:55,835 --> 00:17:58,547
Take your pick. I'll hook you up. Her?

307
00:17:58,807 --> 00:18:00,614
- Her? Him?
- No, I'm...

308
00:18:00,794 --> 00:18:02,518
I'm good. I had a big breakfast.

309
00:18:02,778 --> 00:18:05,754
Okay.
You have a problem with blow jobs?

310
00:18:06,014 --> 00:18:07,821
Actually, I'm a big fan of the blow job.

311
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:10,681
As long as she uses 2 hands
and doesn't meander too much

312
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:13,079
I just have a woman at home
who might not appreciate

313
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:15,431
somebody else's lips
wrapped around my monkey.

314
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:18,439
I imagine she's still a little miffed
about the accidental mouth thing.

315
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,436
You would imagine correctly, right.

316
00:18:20,894 --> 00:18:21,980
Any...

317
00:18:23,877 --> 00:18:25,153
Titsuckers ?

318
00:18:25,473 --> 00:18:26,844
A daughter, Rebecca.

319
00:18:27,475 --> 00:18:29,826
Magic. Plays the guitar.

320
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:31,847
Loves the heavy metal,
worships Satan.

321
00:18:32,107 --> 00:18:35,817
Shucks. You got yourself a little fam-damly, Moody.

322
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:38,740
Which is why you should write my

323
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,290
fucking book,
'cause you need to provide for them.

324
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,697
You know what...
What am I going to write about ?

325
00:18:44,552 --> 00:18:47,229
What you were born
a poor Black child, now you're an icon

326
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:49,795
everything you touch turns to gold.

327
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:52,297
No offense but I need a bigger theme.

328
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:10,552
- Thanks, sweetheart.
- Anytime.

329
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,083
Job well done.

330
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,091
Cool.

331
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,296
Very cool.

332
00:19:20,045 --> 00:19:21,830
Let's find ourselves a bigger theme?

333
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:28,131
Hang the fucking Pope.

334
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,325
You want some, Daddy?

335
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:33,695
I gotta tell you something.

336
00:19:37,773 --> 00:19:41,483
- I gotta fucking tell you something.
- What? What do you gotta tell me?

337
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:47,689
I love you.

338
00:19:49,482 --> 00:19:51,126
I fucking love you, babe.

339
00:19:51,516 --> 00:19:52,791
You wanna fuck?

340
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:54,902
You could choke me if you want.

341
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,084
Just a little.

342
00:19:57,141 --> 00:19:58,720
I don't know if I can do it anymore.

343
00:19:58,894 --> 00:20:01,488
It's cool, take it easy, baby,
slow down.

344
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,305
I won't boggy any of yours.

345
00:20:03,565 --> 00:20:05,604
Not the blow, the job, Jesus Christ,

346
00:20:05,774 --> 00:20:08,133
Marce, you gotta listen to me
once in a while.

347
00:20:08,303 --> 00:20:11,499
OK, OK, but what the fuck
are you talking about ?

348
00:20:11,937 --> 00:20:14,769
You love your job,
you were born to be a ten-percenter.

349
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:17,556
No, babe, I gotta get off the train.
It's fucking killing me.

350
00:20:17,726 --> 00:20:18,971
Like, you know what?

351
00:20:19,623 --> 00:20:20,975
Maybe I need to produce.

352
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:23,173
Fuck that.

353
00:20:23,332 --> 00:20:25,962
Fucking asslicker, you're not creative.

354
00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:29,565
You haven't had an original thought
since the day we met.

355
00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:31,118
Which isn't a bad thing.

356
00:20:31,276 --> 00:20:33,845
You need to sell, it is what you do.

357
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:35,809
And you do the shit out of it.

358
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,370
But what if I couldn't?

359
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,175
What if, all of a sudden,
I just... I fuckin' couldn't?

360
00:20:40,435 --> 00:20:43,979
Like what? Like if you end up in a fucking
wheelchair, all tweaked and shit.

361
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:47,745
You're not fuckin' listening to me,
you never fuckin' listen to me.

362
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:54,346
I'm listening, baby. I'm right here.

363
00:21:02,537 --> 00:21:05,100
What the fuck, you're supposed
to be taking me home.

364
00:21:05,594 --> 00:21:09,039
I just thought I would give you a little
something to put in your book.

365
00:21:11,294 --> 00:21:13,535
We drove out here together
in a beat shit,

366
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,892
a Mustang that didn't go in reverse
anymore.

367
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:19,430
I was gonna be a guitar hero and she was
gonna design my stage clothes.

368
00:21:20,294 --> 00:21:23,000
I ended up producing,
she ended up alone.

369
00:21:23,877 --> 00:21:24,906
All the time.

370
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:26,936
She wanted the house.

371
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,590
I wanted the freedom.

372
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,665
Sure as fuck got it.

373
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:36,086
Now I drink what I want,

374
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,293
snort what I want,

375
00:21:39,482 --> 00:21:40,704
fuck what I want.

376
00:21:42,996 --> 00:21:44,550
All I want is her.

377
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:50,036
Just go knock on her door.

378
00:21:50,895 --> 00:21:52,117
Fuck that.

379
00:21:52,986 --> 00:21:54,599
Not nearly drunk enough for that.

380
00:21:56,059 --> 00:21:57,409
- Thank you.
- For what?

381
00:21:57,805 --> 00:22:01,105
- Reminding me to call my old lady.
- The one that didn't bail you out?

382
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:04,176
Probably what I dig most about her.

383
00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:08,226
Karen?

384
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,100
Marcy.

385
00:22:11,943 --> 00:22:13,128
Hold on a sec, what?

386
00:22:13,647 --> 00:22:16,471
Is somebody crying?
Charlie's crying, what the...

387
00:22:17,392 --> 00:22:18,823
You guys are fuckin' retarded.

388
00:22:28,721 --> 00:22:30,427
Wassup, cocky smurf?

389
00:22:30,846 --> 00:22:33,337
He's saying some shit about not wanting
to be an agent anymore.

390
00:22:33,548 --> 00:22:36,424
- I didn't know what to do.
- You did the right thing, half pint.

391
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:39,344
Runkle, open up.

392
00:22:39,773 --> 00:22:41,294
Charlie, come on, let me in.

393
00:22:41,691 --> 00:22:42,580
Charlie?

394
00:22:44,026 --> 00:22:44,938
Charlie?

395
00:22:46,287 --> 00:22:47,268
Come on.

396
00:22:48,143 --> 00:22:49,137
Charlie!

397
00:22:57,046 --> 00:22:58,717
What the fuck, Runkle?

398
00:22:59,757 --> 00:23:00,948
I got the axe today.

399
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:03,108
You got fired?

400
00:23:03,485 --> 00:23:05,186
Why the fuck didn't you tell me?

401
00:23:05,448 --> 00:23:06,591
I tried.

402
00:23:06,815 --> 00:23:08,621
You weren't fucking listening!

403
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:11,659
You never fucking
listen to me anymore.

404
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:14,395
Right, I never listen to you.
Got it.

405
00:23:14,657 --> 00:23:15,563
Asshole.

406
00:23:16,381 --> 00:23:18,888
Scarface, you're not helping.
Go elsewhere.

407
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,839
Okay big boy, lay it on me.

408
00:23:30,805 --> 00:23:32,698
Well, help yourself, whatever.

409
00:23:41,955 --> 00:23:43,673
They shitcanned my ass.

410
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:47,434
Which makes total sense,
my heart wasn't in it anymore.

411
00:23:47,554 --> 00:23:48,559
Well...

412
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,615
that and the masturbation videos.

413
00:23:52,376 --> 00:23:53,752
Do I even wanna know?

414
00:23:54,336 --> 00:23:55,780
It's sobering Hank.

415
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,725
- Seeing yourself make faces like that.
- I hear you.

416
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:03,095
No man should ever have
to bear witness to his o-face.

417
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:04,229
Word.

418
00:24:07,087 --> 00:24:08,848
What's the worse that can happen?

419
00:24:08,968 --> 00:24:11,028
You never work again in this town?

420
00:24:11,148 --> 00:24:12,271
No, okay! Look,

421
00:24:12,391 --> 00:24:14,424
No, sorry, sorry, look.

422
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:17,984
Let's cross that bridge
when we inevitably come to it.

423
00:24:18,104 --> 00:24:20,779
Look, but till then...
it's me and you broheme.

424
00:24:21,174 --> 00:24:24,238
I'm with you, through Hill and Dale,
through hell and back.

425
00:24:24,358 --> 00:24:26,067
- That's nice.
- I'm right behind you.

426
00:24:26,187 --> 00:24:28,431
But you don't bring in any money.

427
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:32,321
Just so happens,
Lew Ashby is out there right now.

428
00:24:32,441 --> 00:24:34,092
Wants me to write his biography.

429
00:24:34,478 --> 00:24:36,634
Really? That's a big deal.

430
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,131
They've been trying to put a writer²on that for a while.

431
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,766
Things are looking up already.

432
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:43,597
You done with your bath there
Kingdog?

433
00:24:45,697 --> 00:24:49,144
Let's towel you off, big boy.
What's with the bib, Bob, come on?

434
00:24:49,264 --> 00:24:50,809
I ate some crustacean.

435
00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:53,424
You look like you crawled out
of a dumpster behind the redlobster.

436
00:24:53,544 --> 00:24:55,712
You smell like a mermaid, asspack.

437
00:25:49,606 --> 00:25:52,437
Any points for saying I'm sorry
in a romance language?

438
00:25:53,223 --> 00:25:54,389
I don't know.

439
00:25:57,807 --> 00:26:00,779
I'll think about it next time
I'm going down on the wrong guy.

440
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:02,925
Fair enough.

441
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,451
As long as he's thin, bent
and uncircumcized.

442
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:08,915
That's lovely.

443
00:26:14,064 --> 00:26:15,074
Come to bed.

444
00:26:34,974 --> 00:26:36,129
I'm sorry, baby.

445
00:26:37,962 --> 00:26:38,858
I know.

446
00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:41,531
Me too.

447
00:26:44,063 --> 00:26:45,161
I love you.

448
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:53,199
I love you too.

449
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:58,449
But what if that's not enough?

450
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:05,888
This is not very good pillow talk.

451
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:08,522
Oh shut up.
