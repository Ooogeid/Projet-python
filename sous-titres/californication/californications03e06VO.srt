00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,959
<i>Previously on </i>Californication<i>...</i>

2
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:05,004
- Did you two come together?
- No. We just came in together.

3
00:00:07,638 --> 00:00:10,205
I've never stepped outside
of my marriage before.

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,666
But I'm guessing
that you feel like you're...

5
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:14,096
owed one.

6
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:19,518
Come on. You're coming in.
I want to take a look at you.

7
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,480
This is so not fair.

8
00:00:26,287 --> 00:00:28,486
Daisy... came to see me.

9
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,404
What'd she say, that little tramp?

10
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:33,366
She said that she had contracted
a few STDs.

11
00:00:33,706 --> 00:00:35,951
No, I seriously think
I'm gonna throw up right now.

12
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,877
What could possibly be so awful
about visiting the woman

13
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:41,082
who pushed you through
her magnificent vagina?

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,000
Chelsea has Lakers tickets.

15
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:46,754
<i>I'm so excited. I can't wait
to squeeze that little peanut.</i>

16
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,548
I wouldn't get too excited.
She hasn't been very pleasant lately.

17
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,636
Look who's here.
Not even a hello. Oh, good times.

18
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,263
What? Were you just
gonna leave me behind?

19
00:01:11,737 --> 00:01:13,197
Chelsea.
I need to take this.

20
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:16,074
What do you mean? What,
are you with the organ transplant team?

21
00:01:16,199 --> 00:01:18,699
Shut that shit down.
Tell your old man about your weekend.

22
00:01:18,824 --> 00:01:21,288
Start by telling me
how much you missed me.

23
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,207
We had a grand old time.

24
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,284
Soaked up some culture, did you?
Museums, shopping, girl talk?

25
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:28,379
Some dirty-water hot dogs maybe?
What?

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,161
Where you going?

27
00:01:30,286 --> 00:01:32,364
I'm still allowed to pee, aren't I?

28
00:01:38,122 --> 00:01:39,446
Remember this?

29
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:42,059
Remember when you thought
that was a good idea?

30
00:01:42,184 --> 00:01:44,979
It's awful.
I don't recognize her anymore.

31
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:46,969
I told you.
She's changed, right?

32
00:01:47,094 --> 00:01:49,191
She's a miserable little bitch
all the time now.

33
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:52,403
- I guess at least we know why, right?
- We do?

34
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:55,322
Chelsea.
It's all she cares about anymore.

35
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,317
It's better than her
caring about a boy, right?

36
00:02:00,683 --> 00:02:02,863
'cause you can't get
pregnant from your bff.

37
00:02:02,988 --> 00:02:04,999
At least not without the aid of
a turkey baster.

38
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,460
- This isn't working anymore.
- What isn't working?

39
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,420
- Don't say that.
- This arrangement.

40
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:12,381
She need to be living
with me right now, okay?

41
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:14,357
I know she hates me.

42
00:02:14,765 --> 00:02:16,534
And I know she wants
to live here with you.

43
00:02:16,784 --> 00:02:18,929
But fuck it. We're the parents.

44
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:20,556
We get to decide.

45
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,168
- We?
- Yes, we.

46
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:24,609
So you're saying we just pack up
and leave LA?

47
00:02:24,734 --> 00:02:26,520
The three of us,
move back to NY together?

48
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,315
Well, soon, yeah.

49
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,261
End of the semester, whatever.

50
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,610
This place is toxic.

51
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,281
LA is no place to raise a daughter.

52
00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:40,076
That's my line.
You're stealing my shit.

53
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,300
To our beautiful family...

54
00:02:44,018 --> 00:02:47,037
Our black president,
and my magnificent dong.

55
00:03:33,114 --> 00:03:35,673
I'm not even a part
of this fucking family anymore?

56
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,717
She gets to decide?
How is that fair?

57
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,013
I don't think
we were shooting for fair.

58
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,264
For the 1st time in my life,
I'm actually happy, now

59
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,266
I must go someplace
I have no friends?

60
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:48,192
NY doesn't mean shit to me.
It isn't the answer to anything!

61
00:03:48,317 --> 00:03:50,938
Telling her together... I guess
that didn't work out so well, did it?

62
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:53,941
You know what? It kind of came up
while the narcissist in the family

63
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,419
was deep-conditioning.

64
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:57,611
I can't believe
you didn't fight for me.

65
00:03:57,943 --> 00:04:00,781
There's nothing to fight about, honey.
This was always the plan.

66
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:03,033
You're gonna be late
to school, okay?

67
00:04:03,565 --> 00:04:05,995
We will talk about it later.
I love you.

68
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:11,138
So, well, the worst is over.

69
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:15,794
You think the french Revolution was over
when they stormed the Bastille?

70
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,924
No, no. They had a little thing called
the Terror. It happened years later.

71
00:04:19,232 --> 00:04:22,136
She will get used to the idea.
Who doesn't want to live in New York?

72
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,850
Anyway, professor...

73
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,203
- Get dressed or you're gonna be late.
- Not that late.

74
00:04:28,328 --> 00:04:31,186
It's a very progressive school.
The students almost teach themselves.

75
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,855
- Stop!
- Why?

76
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:33,939
Because.

77
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:37,193
For a start,
I don't know where you've been.

78
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:39,737
I'm freshly showered, right?
That should count.

79
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:42,615
- I don't know where you've been either.
- You do.

80
00:04:43,113 --> 00:04:44,043
I do?

81
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:46,869
What is that, like a riddle?
You getting all sphinx-like on me?

82
00:04:47,363 --> 00:04:48,763
I slept with Bill.

83
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,899
I slept with Bill.

84
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:56,670
I ran into him at NYU
when he was visiting Mia.

85
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,798
She says hi, by the way.

86
00:05:00,138 --> 00:05:03,135
Are you okay?
You look a little sick in your stomach.

87
00:05:05,402 --> 00:05:07,514
Shit, you're totally not
joking about this, are you?

88
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,480
Come on, Hank.
It's not that big a deal.

89
00:05:15,373 --> 00:05:17,623
I kind of felt like I owed him one.

90
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,285
I did, you know,
ruin his life and all.

91
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,350
I mean, that night that I married him,
and then I jumped in the car with you.

92
00:05:25,674 --> 00:05:27,949
God, it feels good
to tell the truth.

93
00:05:32,226 --> 00:05:35,626
Come on, professor.
Come out of there. Get dressed.

94
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,337
I'm so excited
to go to class with you!

95
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:44,953
"Eva lifts her head from her book

96
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,603
"and regards the curious figure
striding her way.

97
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:49,682
"The faint hint of a smile
appears on her face.

98
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,743
"Adam slows down,
reaching her table.

99
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:54,937
"Their eyes meet, and it seems Adam
will do it. But what do you know, folks?

100
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,731
"He averts his eyes
and keeps right on walking,

101
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,733
"jamming his hands in his pockets.

102
00:06:00,675 --> 00:06:04,702
So what can we learn from this early
execrable work from a major...

103
00:06:04,827 --> 00:06:06,699
And I do mean <i>major</i>...

104
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,694
american author?
And don't be shy.

105
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:11,453
Rip him a new asshole
or three or four.

106
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,671
Go. Dig in.

107
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,261
I think "execrable"
is a little harsh.

108
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,471
I mean,
I didn't think it was so bad.

109
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:33,058
And I think those that are auditing
this class really shouldn't participate.

110
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,545
- Others?
- You should let the woman speak.

111
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,229
What did you say your name was?

112
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,814
She didn't.
Next.

113
00:06:42,543 --> 00:06:45,279
"Their eyes meet"?
That's a little hokey, don't you think?

114
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,771
Eva's whole introduction,
really, is just...

115
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:53,577
Stupid, you know? We know she's pretty.
We get it.

116
00:06:53,702 --> 00:06:56,332
And we're out of time. Look at that.
Class has now ended.

117
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,459
Go in peace and love
to serve the word.

118
00:07:08,491 --> 00:07:11,138
Here's the papers on last week's

119
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,557
- poetry of Jagger and Richards.
- Thank you.

120
00:07:23,636 --> 00:07:25,361
Well, then, I'll see you next week.

121
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,285
You are unbelievable.

122
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,766
- What?
- So, Adam...

123
00:07:36,432 --> 00:07:38,146
Which one are you sleeping with?

124
00:07:38,713 --> 00:07:40,773
- Excuse me?
- My bets are...

125
00:07:41,278 --> 00:07:42,965
on the young, voluptuous student.

126
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,514
She's a definite...

127
00:07:44,935 --> 00:07:46,135
Eva prototype.

128
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,103
Please.
There's only one Eva.

129
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:50,427
It's against the rules
to sleep with students.

130
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:52,262
Of course. Yes.

131
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,425
Though when I was in college...

132
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,601
- I slept with...
- "slept with my professor. "

133
00:07:57,928 --> 00:08:01,021
I've heard quite enough about
your sexual goings-on for one day.

134
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,607
I can't believe you kept
this ridiculous story.

135
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:05,859
You wrote this when you were,
like, 23?

136
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,529
I save everything I write...
All parts of the buffalo.

137
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,080
Especially the stuff about you.

138
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:14,678
Yeah, one-act plays, haikus,

139
00:08:15,217 --> 00:08:16,586
grocery lists.

140
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:22,669
I'm sorry, I was just wondering
if you were picking up...

141
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,044
The girls from school.

142
00:08:29,006 --> 00:08:30,884
Not... Not <i>the</i> Karen?

143
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,711
The <i>mamacita</i> of my <i>bambina. Si.</i>

144
00:08:34,438 --> 00:08:35,807
I'm Becca's mom.

145
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,365
- It's nice to meet you.
- I'm Chelsea's mum.

146
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,825
Lovely to meet you finally.

147
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,919
Becca must be delighted
to have you back.

148
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,734
Well, she's not back back.

149
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:46,338
It's just a quick visit.

150
00:08:46,463 --> 00:08:48,617
You know,
my work keeps me in New York, so...

151
00:08:48,742 --> 00:08:50,425
I know.
It's so awful, isn't it?

152
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,156
The whole working-mum thing.

153
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:54,934
I'm so lucky
with my teaching schedule.

154
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:59,062
I'm not working this afternoon,
so I could pick them up if you'd like.

155
00:08:59,187 --> 00:09:01,099
No, you know what?
That's OK.

156
00:09:01,224 --> 00:09:03,500
I kind of... I kind of like it.
I miss it, actually.

157
00:09:04,513 --> 00:09:06,227
Who doesn't love a carpool line?

158
00:09:07,402 --> 00:09:09,970
Well, then, problem solved, I guess.

159
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,050
So, lovely to meet you.

160
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,261
And you.
Yes. Yeah, bye.

161
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,132
Oh, my god,
can you believe that woman?

162
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,852
She's real classy-like, right?

163
00:09:23,181 --> 00:09:25,397
- What?
- No, and that ridiculous accent.

164
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,685
- I mean, what the fuck?
- It's pleasant.

165
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,934
She was like, you know,
"so lovely to meet you.

166
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:32,509
- "My schedule".
- She taught to speak like that.

167
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:34,698
She's not making it...
I think you're jealous.

168
00:09:36,062 --> 00:09:38,356
- Are you being jealous?
- No.

169
00:09:38,481 --> 00:09:40,443
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were.

170
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:43,275
She is definitely not your type.

171
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:54,187
There you are,
you V.D.-riddled sack of shit.

172
00:09:54,545 --> 00:09:57,304
Ten days' worth of antibiotics
I have to take,

173
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,223
just in case, mind you.

174
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:02,187
I'm taking them too, you know,
and I'm getting tested tomorrow.

175
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:05,479
Yes, dear, but the delicate balance
of yeast in your vagina

176
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,874
isn't as likely to be compromised
by all this shit, now, is it?

177
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,685
Just, you know, eat more yogurt.

178
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,566
Hey, I'll make you a smoothy.

179
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:16,823
Do I look like I want
a fuking smoothy?

180
00:10:17,456 --> 00:10:20,329
- Whose Corvette is that?
- Rick Springfield.

181
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,288
And a smoothy can be very
refreshing on a hot day.

182
00:10:23,413 --> 00:10:26,083
- Now you got to be fucking with me.
- What fucking with you?

183
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,180
I said, whose car is that
blocking the driveway?

184
00:10:29,305 --> 00:10:30,796
And I said Rick Springfield.

185
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,423
He's got a audition tomorrow,
and we're running lines here.

186
00:10:34,586 --> 00:10:37,183
He is running lines with you
in my house right now?

187
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:40,183
Yes, he's a new client.
I've told you this before.

188
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:43,400
Now, listen to me. I'm gonna be late
coming back from his audition,

189
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:46,219
so I got everything prepped
for our dinner with Hank and Karen.

190
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:49,481
It's gonna be gumbo. Everything going
in the pressure cooker.

191
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,359
All you have to do is remember
to start the rice, please.

192
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:57,282
Rick fucking Springfield is here
in my house right fucking now?

193
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,468
He's upstairs having a nap,

194
00:11:03,988 --> 00:11:05,718
- sort of.
- Or wait.

195
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:08,235
I spoke too soon.
Here's Rick now.

196
00:11:08,608 --> 00:11:12,264
Dude, don't you have anything raunchier
than back issues of Gent Magazine?

197
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:21,951
You're really...
Rick Springfield in my house right now.

198
00:11:24,157 --> 00:11:25,157
You're...

199
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:26,977
You're very tall and...

200
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:28,912
And dark and handsome and, uh...

201
00:11:30,116 --> 00:11:32,680
No. Charlie doesn't have
anything raunchier than that,

202
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:35,942
because he likes to, you know,
kick it old school with the pornography.

203
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:38,258
- Know what I'm saying?
- Church.

204
00:11:38,712 --> 00:11:40,122
Are these my beta-blockers?

205
00:11:40,247 --> 00:11:42,609
- I get real nervous before...
- No, that's just a...

206
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,494
Lip gloss.

207
00:11:45,465 --> 00:11:47,372
Back in the old days,
Sue used to blow me.

208
00:11:48,181 --> 00:11:50,048
But these days,
she likes them younger...

209
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:51,784
And balder.

210
00:11:54,817 --> 00:11:57,237
Don't you need to be running
along somewhere, little one?

211
00:11:57,362 --> 00:11:58,789
Appointments and such?

212
00:11:59,228 --> 00:12:01,970
No, I'm OK.
I just want to stay here talk to Rick.

213
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,149
Not on my watch, OK?
We got work to do.

214
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:06,085
Lots of it.
No time for distractions.

215
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,412
But come on!

216
00:12:07,537 --> 00:12:10,645
One more word out of you, and I'm gonna
tell him what those pills are for.

217
00:12:15,477 --> 00:12:17,879
When I was a kid,
you spoke when you were spoken to,

218
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,395
or else you were chased around
a kitchen with a wooden.

219
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,408
Sorry, we weren't put
on this planet to entertain you.

220
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,786
Untrue...
Entertainment for the poor.

221
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,346
That's what my mother
always called children. Clearly,

222
00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:29,837
she was wrong.

223
00:12:29,962 --> 00:12:31,583
Maybe if you weren't poor...

224
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,305
- Excuse me?
- Poor? Are we?

225
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,303
- I didn't get that memo. Are we poor?
- No offense, Karen, but

226
00:12:37,428 --> 00:12:39,591
Becca showed me a picture
of where you live,

227
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,760
I've been in dorm rooms
that are bigger than that.

228
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,805
I think that it would be best
for Becca if she could stay in LA.

229
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,182
And have at least some
shot at a normal life.

230
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,902
She did say "no offense. "

231
00:13:01,788 --> 00:13:02,943
She returns!

232
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:06,368
Yes, in!

233
00:13:06,695 --> 00:13:08,545
On the fucking line!

234
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,357
I'm gonna take you down, mommy.

235
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:15,227
Is there any sport for which your father
does not have the proper attire?

236
00:13:15,352 --> 00:13:17,379
I bet he swims in a Speedo.
Does he?

237
00:13:21,082 --> 00:13:23,468
Take that, you lazy motherfucker!

238
00:13:25,842 --> 00:13:26,773
All right...

239
00:13:26,898 --> 00:13:29,088
You just caught us
getting some exercise.

240
00:13:30,128 --> 00:13:33,225
- Honey, game's not over.
- That was just a point?

241
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,605
And when you win a whole match,
sacrifice a calf?

242
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,023
- He doesn't...
- Cheers.

243
00:13:37,327 --> 00:13:39,708
Actually mean it,
all that trash talking and such.

244
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,094
That's just his way.
Stacy, this is Becca's mum.

245
00:13:45,002 --> 00:13:47,075
So nice to meet you.
Heard so much about you.

246
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,048
Delighted.
You should stay for dinner.

247
00:13:50,398 --> 00:13:51,615
Just you, not him.

248
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:53,612
OK, give me that racket.

249
00:13:53,737 --> 00:13:56,766
The dean has just requested a heaping
helping of my backhand for dinner.

250
00:13:56,891 --> 00:13:58,717
Yes, of course, you must stay.

251
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:01,590
Oh, well, you know,
that's really kind, but we have plans.

252
00:14:01,964 --> 00:14:03,659
We're meeting some friends, so...

253
00:14:03,784 --> 00:14:05,520
Their friends, not mine.

254
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:08,889
Yes. But the point is
we're going as a family.

255
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,349
<i>Tout ensemble...</i>
So that's the point.

256
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,019
I'd rather stay here
with this family.

257
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,104
Isn't she sweet?

258
00:14:16,491 --> 00:14:19,795
- You know you're always welcome here.
- Yes. Always.

259
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,869
Your mom is visiting from New York.

260
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,528
Have you met your mom?

261
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,490
She's not gonna be here long time
You want to spend time with her, no?

262
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,618
Once you drag me back to New York,

263
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,397
all I'm going to be doing
is spending time with my mother.

264
00:14:32,797 --> 00:14:34,539
I certainly won't have any friends.

265
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,124
Apologize to your mother.

266
00:14:36,754 --> 00:14:39,021
- It's really fine.
- You know what?

267
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:41,550
It seems like you have an open
invitation here, so it's...

268
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:42,558
Of course!

269
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:44,494
It's no problem if you want to stay.

270
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:47,052
And that way, you two can have
a time with your friends.

271
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,553
Yes. Thank you, Felicia.

272
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:58,445
Karen couldn't make it.

273
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,498
Not feeling well.

274
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,722
- Oh, look at you.
- Look at you.

275
00:15:06,847 --> 00:15:08,619
- I miss you.
- Is this for me?

276
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:11,243
- What, my muumuu?
- Looks like America's next top smurf.

277
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,578
It's just the schmata
I wear around the house. What?

278
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,914
In with you!

279
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,481
Where's the Runkle-ator?

280
00:15:16,606 --> 00:15:17,906
He's stuck in...

281
00:15:18,164 --> 00:15:20,519
traffic on his way
over from the Valley.

282
00:15:20,644 --> 00:15:23,296
That man is dead to me, by the way.
Do you see this?

283
00:15:23,684 --> 00:15:26,383
This hideous vd-type pustule
on my face?

284
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,096
- No, not really.
- That is disgusting.

285
00:15:29,901 --> 00:15:32,084
- You see it, right?
- Yeah, it's deep in there.

286
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:33,779
Guess what?
He gave it to me.

287
00:15:33,904 --> 00:15:36,266
Thanks.
And he tried to rape me, by the way.

288
00:15:36,391 --> 00:15:37,936
- But how are you?
- I'm good.

289
00:15:39,193 --> 00:15:41,022
You know, Becca, she's...

290
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,274
I know.

291
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,234
Make way for the victors.

292
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,486
- Victory.
- He got the part?

293
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,004
You got the part?

294
00:15:50,387 --> 00:15:51,786
Congratulations...

295
00:15:51,911 --> 00:15:53,243
Is that Rick Springfield?

296
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:54,452
I believe it is.

297
00:15:55,952 --> 00:15:57,902
And who are you, pretty lady?

298
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,755
Rick Springfield
and Andy Gibb on solid gold...

299
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,465
This means nothing to you?

300
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,592
I remember.

301
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,598
Everybody loved
Rick Springfield, right?

302
00:16:10,723 --> 00:16:13,137
She just didn't have the poster
over her bed. You...

303
00:16:13,262 --> 00:16:16,224
I'm guessing you practiced
your she-bopping to that?

304
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,336
You know what always
used to start my motor?

305
00:16:18,461 --> 00:16:19,227
Mannix.

306
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,749
That tall Armenian
with a great head of hair...

307
00:16:23,972 --> 00:16:26,943
Just thinking of him
still gets my juices flowing.

308
00:16:28,668 --> 00:16:30,418
Teen fantasies are great.

309
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,407
I've had some of my own.

310
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,367
What, you?
Duran Duran?

311
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,628
Boy George?

312
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,024
Cheryl Tiegs, thank you very much.

313
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:40,983
My point is, you have to remember...

314
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:44,878
Musicians, actors, models...
These are people with flaws and such.

315
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,380
There's no way
they could possibly live up

316
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,020
to the excitement, the mystery

317
00:16:49,145 --> 00:16:51,801
that our tortured teen psyches
choose to project upon them.

318
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,269
That's my point.

319
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,772
I made a girl come seven times once.

320
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:02,136
Over the course
of an entire relationship?

321
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,105
All in a row?

322
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,232
Sweet Jesus.

323
00:17:07,391 --> 00:17:09,691
Who's ready for dessert?
I know I am.

324
00:17:09,816 --> 00:17:12,322
Cheers to you, Rick Springfield.
Hold on a second.

325
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:25,003
What are you doing moping in the fridge?
Rick Springfield is stealing your girl,

326
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,546
not Jessie's girl,
your girl, Runkle's girl.

327
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,194
I'm well aware of this fact.

328
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:32,437
- So get in there and make her jealous.
- With what? You gonna loan me Karen?

329
00:17:32,823 --> 00:17:36,423
- Disgusting. What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

330
00:17:38,921 --> 00:17:40,071
Shit, really?

331
00:17:42,722 --> 00:17:44,363
We'll be right over.
We got to go.

332
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,860
Little problem with the offspring.
Don't panic. They just...

333
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:50,860
It seems Becca and Chelsea staged
a raid on the Dean's wine cellar.

334
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,156
I knew that Chelsea was trouble.

335
00:17:54,932 --> 00:17:55,982
Honey, I...

336
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,410
Call me later.
I hope she's okay.

337
00:17:58,726 --> 00:18:01,126
- Bye, Rick Springfield.
- Bye, guys.

338
00:18:04,226 --> 00:18:05,391
Do you want to...

339
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:07,961
Go up to my room
and listen to some records?

340
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,757
- Only if they're mine.
- Church.

341
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:23,184
What are you serving for dessert?
I know what I want.

342
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:25,266
Tube steak.

343
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,710
Yes, I know.

344
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,083
Listen, Sue, this is...

345
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:32,649
a really difficult time
for me right now,

346
00:18:32,774 --> 00:18:35,472
and besides,
I should probably let you know,

347
00:18:35,597 --> 00:18:37,949
- I think I have V.D.
- No worries.

348
00:18:38,403 --> 00:18:41,053
Just slap a bag on it,
and I'm good to go.

349
00:18:45,756 --> 00:18:46,750
Welcome.

350
00:18:47,775 --> 00:18:49,002
Glass of Cab?

351
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,468
I forget what fucking year this is.

352
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:54,616
- She's drunk.
- No.

353
00:18:54,741 --> 00:18:58,225
- She can't walk in a straight line.
- Felicia, are you drunk?

354
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,650
Just a tiny bit.

355
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:02,932
Seems such a shame to let all
that perfectly good wine go to waste.

356
00:19:03,485 --> 00:19:05,420
They opened about $3,000 worth.

357
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:08,713
Which is the one you were saving
for our 20th anniversary?

358
00:19:08,838 --> 00:19:10,767
Not that we're gonna get there,
at this point.

359
00:19:10,892 --> 00:19:12,859
Darling, you should slow down
a little bit.

360
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:14,903
Karen, may I get you a glass?

361
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,739
I've got an '82 Petrus,

362
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,573
an '86 Chateau Margaux,

363
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,773
and a '92 screaming Eagle Cab
that'll blow your mind.

364
00:19:21,898 --> 00:19:25,333
- What can I get you?
- This is not some social occasion!

365
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,739
I have come here
to collect my daughter!

366
00:19:27,864 --> 00:19:29,209
Okay, so where is she?

367
00:19:29,807 --> 00:19:33,546
I understand your concern, but...
is profanity really warranted?

368
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,467
- Where the fuck is she?
- The kids are chained in the basement.

369
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,595
She's not as scary as she seems.
She has some anger-management issues.

370
00:19:41,076 --> 00:19:42,472
- Thank you.
- Excellent.

371
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,973
A whole family of sociopaths.

372
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:48,285
OK, in this case, maybe she's right.
We should just get Becca and leave.

373
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,270
If you like.

374
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:53,136
I don't see why we can't just sit down
as adults and talk this thing through.

375
00:19:53,261 --> 00:19:54,984
What? Your idea of shitty parenting?

376
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,148
I don't think we should comment,
even though you're absolutely right.

377
00:19:59,273 --> 00:20:02,531
Let's all just try to keep cool heads,
shall we?

378
00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:04,868
The girls are just testing
our boundaries.

379
00:20:04,993 --> 00:20:07,038
's's all perfectly normal
for their age range.

380
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,745
Normal for Chelsea, maybe.

381
00:20:09,603 --> 00:20:11,459
Are you implying
that this is Chelsea's fault?

382
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,129
I'm not implying anything.
I'm just saying it flat out.

383
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:17,257
- You've got a lot of nerve.
- Now you've angered the dean.

384
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,594
Fuck it, Stacy.
She's right.

385
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,589
This is obviously Chelsea's fault.

386
00:20:23,714 --> 00:20:26,766
Becca doesn't have the gumption
to get in any kind of serious trouble.

387
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,571
- She's a follower.
- Excuse me?

388
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:30,103
I meant it in a nice way.

389
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,855
You know, teenagers suck.

390
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:33,926
They're all bloody awful,
Chelsea in particular.

391
00:20:34,051 --> 00:20:36,193
I just hope she makes it
to 17 without getting pregnant.

392
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,318
Honey!

393
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:39,696
That's not fair.

394
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:42,782
You're all such fucking hypocrites.

395
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,052
We are the way we are

396
00:20:46,593 --> 00:20:48,746
because you made us this way.

397
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,595
Okay, sweetie, come on.
Let's go home.

398
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,420
I don't want to go home.

399
00:20:53,728 --> 00:20:56,081
I want you all
to listen to me for once!

400
00:20:56,206 --> 00:20:58,172
Sweetie, we're here.

401
00:20:58,611 --> 00:20:59,757
We're listening.

402
00:21:00,266 --> 00:21:01,551
We're all ears.

403
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:02,969
What do you want to say?

404
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,867
I fucking love this part!

405
00:21:32,163 --> 00:21:34,167
Hi. What took you so long, Runkle?

406
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:38,296
You know, they've been at it
for a while over there. Sounds good too.

407
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,715
I almost started without you.

408
00:21:41,357 --> 00:21:43,134
I'm just finishing up some dishes.

409
00:21:45,328 --> 00:21:48,418
- I thought I'd let a few things soak.
- Runkle, are you...

410
00:21:49,478 --> 00:21:50,475
Were you crying?

411
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:54,773
Maybe... a little.

412
00:21:55,704 --> 00:21:57,368
- Yes.
- Oh, please!

413
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,210
Over that?

414
00:22:00,464 --> 00:22:02,631
That's kids' stuff. Ignore it.

415
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:04,245
Destroy me, Rick Springfield!

416
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,120
Listen to that, will you?

417
00:22:07,003 --> 00:22:09,043
I don't know
how to compete with that!

418
00:22:09,168 --> 00:22:12,914
I only made Marcy squeal like that
when I put the ring on her finger!

419
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,290
Harry Winston?

420
00:22:15,313 --> 00:22:17,476
- Tiffany.
- Oh, Runkle.

421
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:21,089
You are the saddest sack
I have ever seen!

422
00:22:21,938 --> 00:22:24,474
To you, the glass is
always half empty?

423
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,927
Never half full?

424
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:29,347
Right now my wife is half
full of Rick Springfield!

425
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,100
That's exactly what I mean. Men.

426
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,186
I mean, you are the biggest bunch
of pussies there ever was.

427
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:39,289
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

428
00:22:39,414 --> 00:22:41,814
Well, I'm gonna let you
off the hook this time.

429
00:22:42,286 --> 00:22:43,437
But before I go...

430
00:22:43,768 --> 00:22:47,752
I'm gonna a give you a little tip
on how to get your little wifey back.

431
00:22:49,228 --> 00:22:52,922
Sex is supposed to be about joy,
Runkle.

432
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:55,538
Pure joy.

433
00:22:56,726 --> 00:22:59,043
And if you've forgotten what
that sounds like...

434
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:05,925
Don't stop!

435
00:23:06,362 --> 00:23:08,261
Runkle, no! Don't...

436
00:23:08,613 --> 00:23:10,936
Stop! Oh, god!

437
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:12,557
You are good!

438
00:23:15,566 --> 00:23:18,048
That is perfect!

439
00:23:21,156 --> 00:23:22,546
That is...

440
00:23:22,671 --> 00:23:23,735
perfect!

441
00:23:36,135 --> 00:23:37,135
Collini...

442
00:23:37,844 --> 00:23:38,791
Out.

443
00:23:44,777 --> 00:23:46,227
Come on, take this.

444
00:23:47,315 --> 00:23:49,501
Now, you may wake up
in the middle of the night...

445
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:51,387
Possibly craving an egg McMuffin.

446
00:23:52,058 --> 00:23:54,041
You should not get off the ride
at that point,

447
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,060
but remain in your seat
with your seatbelt securely fastened.

448
00:23:58,456 --> 00:23:59,656
Okay, sweetie?

449
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,060
Good night, sweetie.

450
00:24:04,622 --> 00:24:07,255
I promise,
everything will be better tomorrow.

451
00:24:07,658 --> 00:24:09,655
Except for your head.
That'll feel much worse.

452
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:11,191
Stay.

453
00:24:18,731 --> 00:24:20,181
What's up, sweetie?

454
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,713
We don't have to do what she says,
you know.

455
00:24:24,175 --> 00:24:25,235
What who says?

456
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:26,484
Her.

457
00:24:26,838 --> 00:24:27,838
The enemy.

458
00:24:28,913 --> 00:24:30,601
Your mom is not the enemy.

459
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:32,936
She loves you.
She wants what's best for you.

460
00:24:33,061 --> 00:24:35,515
Mom doesn't understand.
She never will.

461
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,509
This is it, okay?

462
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,847
I'm not just gonna wake up
one day and be like her...

463
00:24:40,972 --> 00:24:42,872
Six feet tall and beautiful.

464
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:46,859
You already are beautiful.

465
00:24:47,963 --> 00:24:50,597
Chelsea's
the only friend I've ever had...

466
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:54,117
the only one
who accepts me for who I really am.

467
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,373
- That is not true.
- It is.

468
00:24:57,755 --> 00:25:00,810
Do you know what it's like
to have no one and nothing...

469
00:25:01,654 --> 00:25:03,754
how totally awful that feels?

470
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:08,805
Yes, I think I do. I...

471
00:25:09,465 --> 00:25:12,490
Once upon a time, I felt like that.

472
00:25:14,072 --> 00:25:15,221
Now I have you.

473
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,480
Yet, somehow...

474
00:25:20,749 --> 00:25:22,299
I still have nothing.

475
00:25:56,713 --> 00:25:57,713
So...

476
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,186
I guess you're on her side,
like you guys are th t team right now.

477
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:05,688
We're a team, all right.

478
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:10,522
Just not a very good one...

479
00:26:11,407 --> 00:26:12,904
not without our captain.

480
00:26:14,146 --> 00:26:17,575
You're right. L.A. Is no place
to raise a daughter or a dad.

481
00:26:18,732 --> 00:26:20,161
We need your guidance.

482
00:26:21,008 --> 00:26:22,872
We need you, mommy dearest...

483
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,583
Really...

484
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,963
Even though sometimes
we may take you for granted and...

485
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,674
throw embarrassing
hissy fits and get drunk...

486
00:26:34,286 --> 00:26:37,178
and generally act like
we don't give a shit about anything.

487
00:26:38,572 --> 00:26:41,867
So you're just both adolescent
girls at heart, right?

488
00:26:43,075 --> 00:26:44,975
Yes, we are, the both of us.

489
00:26:47,961 --> 00:26:49,482
I like you like this.

490
00:26:50,838 --> 00:26:52,738
What, all defeated and shit?

491
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:54,988
Yes. You're like...

492
00:26:55,528 --> 00:26:57,301
You're like putty in my hands.

493
00:26:57,624 --> 00:26:59,154
- Oh, yeah?
- Really.

494
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,229
Do with me what you will.

495
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,850
- Anything?
- Yeah, anything at all.

496
00:27:20,532 --> 00:27:22,139
You know what I said about bill...

497
00:27:22,493 --> 00:27:24,225
- this morning?
- Yes.

498
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:25,601
Got ya.

499
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:31,219
You fucker.
