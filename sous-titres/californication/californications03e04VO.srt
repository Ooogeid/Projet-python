1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,057
Previously on Californication...

2
00:00:02,316 --> 00:00:04,420
- This is where you work
- You want to come?

3
00:00:04,709 --> 00:00:06,547
Would that involve seeing you naked?

4
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,215
- Most definitely.
- I think not.

5
00:00:08,607 --> 00:00:10,975
In the interest
of student-teacher relations.

6
00:00:15,062 --> 00:00:17,725
- Yes, <i>Fraulein</i>?
- Tonight, my house,

7
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,353
- english department fall mixer.
- How many jobs do you have?

8
00:00:21,114 --> 00:00:23,272
- You got a paper route too?
- Did you come together?

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,107
No. We just came in together.

10
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:38,704
- I fucking hate you!
- I'll move back in.

11
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,581
I do my thing, you do yours.

12
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:41,874
Fine by me.

13
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:44,835
No means no, you know!

14
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:46,965
Is this the surprise?

15
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,340
- I signed a big fish today.
- <i>Good for you.</i>

16
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:52,343
- Maybe you can move the fuck out now.
- Come on.

17
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:56,105
I was looking for Charlie.

18
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:58,683
Are you inside that woman?

19
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:00,059
I can explain.

20
00:01:17,156 --> 00:01:18,506
Bob's your uncle.

21
00:01:22,488 --> 00:01:24,442
Looks like you caught me
doing a little...

22
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:25,876
pre-class meditato.

23
00:01:26,537 --> 00:01:29,005
- We should talk.
- You're not preggers, are you?

24
00:01:29,173 --> 00:01:31,382
Hank, we kissed.
That was all.

25
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:33,968
Technically speaking,
you kissed me, for what it's worth.

26
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,512
I've never done that before.

27
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,445
Never kissed a man?
That's just weird.

28
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,959
Are you a hooker or something?
'Cause hookers don't kiss.

29
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:44,014
Neither do marines.
That's the best gay porn title:

30
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:45,980
- "Marines don't kiss".
- I'm just saying

31
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:48,561
I've never stepped outside
of my marriage before.

32
00:01:48,686 --> 00:01:49,985
Of course not.

33
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,154
Who in their right mind
would step out on his royal deanness?

34
00:01:53,523 --> 00:01:56,491
I know Stacy's not exactly
of your tribe.

35
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,646
But once upon a time
I was very much in love with the man.

36
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:02,848
- Before he cheated on me, that is.
- Nelly!

37
00:02:03,305 --> 00:02:06,408
Are you trying to tell me that
that smarmy piece of wiener cheese

38
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:09,823
- took his love to town?
- Oldest story in the book, I'm afraid.

39
00:02:09,948 --> 00:02:12,298
He fell for one of his students.
We got through it.

40
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,924
Counseling, couples therapy.

41
00:02:14,226 --> 00:02:15,765
Over-intellectualizing the thing

42
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,471
to an absurd degree.
We're really quite good at that.

43
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:23,184
Rock on with your bad selves.
That's awesome, but I'm guessing

44
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:26,228
that you feel like you're...
owed one.

45
00:02:26,495 --> 00:02:28,735
Like you got this
"Get out of jail free" card,

46
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,442
and you just don't know
how or when to use it?

47
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,450
Or maybe I do.

48
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:35,878
Shucks.

49
00:02:36,943 --> 00:02:40,894
I'd be flattered, but I try not
to involve myself

50
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:43,580
in other people's domestic strife.

51
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,459
Really, Hank?
I haven't known you all that long,

52
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,876
but that doesn't seem
like part of your programming.

53
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,349
That's the thing.
It's a new thing based on a shitload

54
00:02:51,474 --> 00:02:54,882
of really horrible experiences.
But it's a thing nonetheless.

55
00:02:55,181 --> 00:02:57,426
And who says
I'd ever cash in such a chit

56
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,094
on the likes of you?

57
00:03:01,429 --> 00:03:04,163
I would be the lucky one
if you would.

58
00:03:04,442 --> 00:03:06,892
I mean,
you're a great broad, Felicia.

59
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:09,019
You deserve to be happier.

60
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:19,846
- Why can't I stop kissing you?
- It's not your fault.

61
00:03:19,971 --> 00:03:22,368
I'm like flypaper
for the emotionally disturbed.

62
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:25,918
That's my balls.

63
00:03:27,862 --> 00:03:29,917
Hey. Am I interrupting something?

64
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,070
Just some furtive fucking.

65
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,005
- I'll come back.
- Please. This fellow?

66
00:03:35,957 --> 00:03:37,657
Give a girl some credit.

67
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:39,777
I have to go to class.

68
00:03:43,763 --> 00:03:45,975
- We should talk.
- You're not preggers, are you?

69
00:03:46,752 --> 00:03:49,169
What are you talking about?
You said you were snipped.

70
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,896
That's a relief.

71
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:53,737
- We can't do that anymore.
- You're right.

72
00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:57,866
We should not. I mean,
we could lose our jobs, our homes...

73
00:03:58,702 --> 00:03:59,697
our citizenship.

74
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,199
Yeah, I know.

75
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,802
I was more thinking along the lines
that I haven't had the sex in a while.

76
00:04:04,927 --> 00:04:08,038
And the other night was kind
of like waking a sleeping tiger.

77
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:10,541
If we're not gonna be doing it
on a regular basis,

78
00:04:10,926 --> 00:04:13,893
I don't think we should be doing it
at all. You know what I mean?

79
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:15,880
I do know what you mean,

80
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,174
but that whole waking
the sleeping tiger thing

81
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,600
got me hard.

82
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:24,959
And I'm wet.

83
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,946
Hard and wet,
that's a winning combination.

84
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:31,083
That's like cookies and cream, or...

85
00:04:32,225 --> 00:04:33,775
Lennon and McCartney.

86
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:24,066
Hank, I've been making
some phone calls on your behalf.

87
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,441
And guess what.

88
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:27,952
People think you're a cunt.
No joke.

89
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:30,793
Here's what I think we should do.

90
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:34,291
There's a lot of dried up Hollywood
snatch out there in need of watering.

91
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,303
Powerful older women
whose limp-dicked husbands

92
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:40,278
have long since stopped
tending their gardens.

93
00:05:40,832 --> 00:05:44,760
And they want someone young,
dumb, full of come.

94
00:05:45,443 --> 00:05:47,054
That's where you come in.

95
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,990
I think we should send you
around town,

96
00:05:50,422 --> 00:05:53,965
these executive suites,
and you charm your way

97
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,194
into the hearts, minds, and pants
of these unfuckable monsters.

98
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:02,035
Next thing you know,
my phone is ringing for Hank Moody.

99
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,442
You're suggesting
that I dump this writer thing

100
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:06,573
and reinvent myself
as a Hollywood man-whore?

101
00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:08,587
Abso-fuckin'- lutely.

102
00:06:10,435 --> 00:06:12,979
And then we turn around
and we sell your story

103
00:06:13,104 --> 00:06:15,124
as a modern day american gigolo.
What do you think?

104
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:18,877
What are you guys doing?
You playing footsie?

105
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,421
She's playing footsie, not me.

106
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:22,880
We're not dating.
Just fucking.

107
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:23,805
Really?

108
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,301
- Just the once.
- Bullshit.

109
00:06:26,859 --> 00:06:28,886
I gave you two blow jobs
in one night.

110
00:06:29,011 --> 00:06:31,890
And you ate this pussy
like your mama made it.

111
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,227
Holy fuckballs!
I got a lunch.

112
00:06:35,753 --> 00:06:36,729
Kristofferson.

113
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:38,576
My most loyal client.

114
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:41,655
Oh, God, I get in a puddle
just thinking about it.

115
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,986
Runkle, now, don't be jealous.

116
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:46,822
I think we should keep emotion out
of this thing of ours.

117
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,240
Good idea, Sue.

118
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,358
I'm totally with you on that.

119
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:52,995
What are you doing later, Hank?
Party at my place.

120
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:55,693
Why don't you stop by
for a steak and a blow job?

121
00:06:55,945 --> 00:06:59,295
I'd love to see you and Runkle
with your swords crossed.

122
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:01,515
Collini out.

123
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,382
What the fuck is going on, big boy?

124
00:07:06,856 --> 00:07:08,969
Just goin' with the flow.

125
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:11,726
I gotta go pick up Becca.
I promised her i'd take her shopping.

126
00:07:11,851 --> 00:07:14,892
- You want to hit a strip club later?
- Sure, yeah.

127
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,476
That sounds like a good time.

128
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:18,979
- I got a student that works at one.
- Of course you do.

129
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:22,255
She dropped my class. I think she did...
I'm perturbed. I want to find out why.

130
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,284
But I can't go alone.
That would be unseemly.

131
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:25,354
Agreed.

132
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:28,447
- You gonna buy me a lap dance?
- Maybe.

133
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,441
If you promise not to come
in your pants.

134
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:31,876
Moody out.

135
00:07:32,968 --> 00:07:35,371
Come on, Becca,
you're killing me softly here.

136
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,210
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
Just bring my daughter back alive,

137
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,134
and I won't call the cops.
I promise.

138
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:44,004
Dad...

139
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,507
you have no fashion sense
whatsoever.

140
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,447
I have excellent fashion sense.
I know what works for me.

141
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:50,719
I have a uniform.

142
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,304
And a massive brain tumor.

143
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,781
Why? I don't want to see your butt crack
every time you get out of the car.

144
00:07:55,906 --> 00:07:58,266
All right, fine.
I'm guilty. Call me crazy.

145
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:01,154
- May I?
- What, butt into our conversation?

146
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,107
Sure. Feel free.
Go ahead.

147
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,898
She looks amazing.

148
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:07,980
See? What she said.

149
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,571
Of course she looks amazing...

150
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:12,533
to the tune of...

151
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,321
200 quatloos?

152
00:08:14,446 --> 00:08:17,889
Jesus christ, if I didn't already
object on moral and religious grounds,

153
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:19,790
I'm never gonna spend
that kind of money.

154
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:21,875
You promised you'd take me shopping.

155
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,770
Yes, honey, but I thought
that meant, you know,

156
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:26,879
buying a few t-shirts at hot topic

157
00:08:27,004 --> 00:08:30,291
and grabbing an orange julius
or something like that.

158
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,261
I'm not that girl anymore, dad.

159
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:36,021
- She's not that girl anymore, dad.
- Thanks for the help, shopkeep.

160
00:08:36,946 --> 00:08:41,334
I see someone over there in the market
for a $250 jethro tull t-shirt.

161
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:43,866
I was at that show.
I paid all of ten bucks for the shirt.

162
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,541
Go. Exploit. Be gone.

163
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,451
I hate you.

164
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,903
Becs? Bexster?

165
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,129
Listen, why don't we go
for a little walk and talk,

166
00:08:53,988 --> 00:08:57,198
I'll get you one of those
hot dogs on a stick that you like?

167
00:08:57,323 --> 00:08:59,383
Or that you used to love, anyway.

168
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:01,790
I don't even know.
I'm giving up. That's it.

169
00:09:06,584 --> 00:09:07,546
There.

170
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,114
Are you happy now?

171
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:10,772
Sort of.

172
00:09:11,313 --> 00:09:13,894
But not really.
Not if you're not.

173
00:09:14,674 --> 00:09:16,824
You can't have it both ways, dad.

174
00:09:18,704 --> 00:09:20,861
- Are you expecting someone?
- Godot.

175
00:09:20,986 --> 00:09:24,021
Oh, godot. Ho ho.
That's not bad.

176
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,889
We're working on her manners.

177
00:09:30,014 --> 00:09:32,128
Hideous creatures,
these teenage girls.

178
00:09:32,253 --> 00:09:33,969
Monstrous.
Couldn't agree with you more.

179
00:09:34,094 --> 00:09:37,576
Is it too late drown them in the tub?
Would you like some tea or sherry

180
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,358
- or, what is it, pimm?
- No, thanks.

181
00:09:40,993 --> 00:09:44,655
- I heard about the fight.
- "Fight". Not really a fight.

182
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,212
It was more like a disagreement.
Caring out loud, really.

183
00:09:48,623 --> 00:09:52,627
- Let me take her shopping with us.
- Your daughter looks like a trollop.

184
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,309
That's... That's mean.

185
00:09:55,434 --> 00:09:57,387
I'm just kidding.
Not really.

186
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,404
Just tell me how much
you want to spend.

187
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:02,905
I'll make the most of it,
and I'll make her look as...

188
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,229
I don't know,
classy as humanly possible.

189
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,439
- I don't know.
- She's such a sweet girl

190
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,195
and misses her mother and doesn't know
how to talk to her father.

191
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,071
- She used to.
- Yeah, well, things change.

192
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,026
She's evolving. She's trying out
different personalities.

193
00:10:16,151 --> 00:10:17,950
You've got to adapt or die.

194
00:10:18,793 --> 00:10:21,570
- Maybe I'll come with you.
- Absolutely not.

195
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,405
Besides, I wouldn't want her
to see me

196
00:10:24,861 --> 00:10:26,833
pull you into a dark corner
and make out with you.

197
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:29,974
You dirty english rose, you.

198
00:10:31,613 --> 00:10:34,363
It would appear
that you bring it out in me.

199
00:10:39,113 --> 00:10:40,313
You all ready?

200
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,083
Can I go?

201
00:10:51,587 --> 00:10:54,842
I told you he wasn't quite the asshole
you said he was.

202
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:56,947
Come along, girls.
Let's hit the road.

203
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:00,617
That's Mr. Asshole to you, Chelsea.

204
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,571
Check it out.

205
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,174
I think I can see
where they put the implants in.

206
00:11:16,694 --> 00:11:19,084
Jesus, it's like the laces
on a football.

207
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:21,638
You gonna be like this all night?
Is Jackie working?

208
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,544
Sorry, sweetie, don't know any Jackie.
You want a dance?

209
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:29,229
Do you really think i would strip
under my real name?

210
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,316
Sorry, I don't know the protocol.

211
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,084
Well, you're forgiven.

212
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,737
What is your stripper handle, then?

213
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:37,905
Ashley.

214
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,280
Ashley Madison.

215
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:41,683
Meet my agent.

216
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:44,581
- This is my student.
- Of course she is.

217
00:11:45,107 --> 00:11:47,873
You know, I had a feeling
you'd show up sooner or later.

218
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:49,989
Is that why you dropped my class?

219
00:11:50,114 --> 00:11:52,419
Yeah, because I'm just
that obsessed with you.

220
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:55,214
Listen, I really can't sit around
and chitchat all night.

221
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,799
So you can buy a dance
or hit the road.

222
00:11:58,061 --> 00:11:59,561
Come here, my agent.

223
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,486
Settle down.

224
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:05,676
This is for me.

225
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:10,145
And this... well, let's go, here...
this is for Ralph Baldo Emerson here.

226
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,663
Come on, big guy.

227
00:12:23,808 --> 00:12:26,744
- What happened to you?
- Nothing scandalous.

228
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:29,843
- Writing's just not my thing.
- I beg to differ.

229
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,990
Well, you can beg all you want,

230
00:12:32,157 --> 00:12:34,833
but it was an elective.
I'm a business major.

231
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,750
I don't have time for it.

232
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:38,465
Business?

233
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,760
Who studies business
in this day and age?

234
00:12:41,088 --> 00:12:43,441
That feels really good, by the way.

235
00:12:43,608 --> 00:12:45,258
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

236
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,945
That there is a man boner.

237
00:12:48,651 --> 00:12:51,428
Yeah, that's pretty much
what we shoot for in here.

238
00:12:52,913 --> 00:12:55,113
Look, I know what you're thinking.

239
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:58,075
I'm not one of your typical
fucked-up damage cases

240
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,278
who's just lusting
for male attention.

241
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,946
I'm not saying
those girls don't exist.

242
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:05,204
Throw a rock in here
and you'll hit six or seven,

243
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:06,729
but that's not me.

244
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:11,044
I am just making
the most of what I got...

245
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,360
while I still got it.

246
00:13:15,623 --> 00:13:16,623
Right.

247
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:18,588
So what's next?

248
00:13:18,713 --> 00:13:21,213
- I get the hell out.
- Just like that?

249
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,469
You're just gonna disappear
like a...

250
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,181
topless salinger?

251
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:28,726
The stripper in the rye.

252
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:31,251
Hey, did you just come
in your pants?

253
00:13:31,892 --> 00:13:34,055
- What? You were grinding... I'm sorry.
- Disgusting!

254
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,048
- It was an exceptional lap dance.
- Freakin' gross!

255
00:13:37,173 --> 00:13:38,673
Nicely done, Runkle.

256
00:13:39,772 --> 00:13:40,944
It was a compliment.

257
00:13:42,713 --> 00:13:44,213
A liquid compliment.

258
00:13:44,338 --> 00:13:45,338
Hello?

259
00:13:45,713 --> 00:13:47,275
Hey, marcy, baby!

260
00:13:47,616 --> 00:13:49,616
I'm at a strip club with hank.

261
00:13:50,378 --> 00:13:52,028
I just got a lap dance.

262
00:13:52,651 --> 00:13:54,124
It's awesome here.

263
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,451
Really? No shit.

264
00:13:58,025 --> 00:13:59,825
Yeah, I'll be right there.

265
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,185
Hey, I gotta go.
Somebody who came and saw the house

266
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,011
is coming back, the 3rd time this week.
I think they might make an offer.

267
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,117
- Good luck, pal.
- No. Sticky fingers.

268
00:14:08,242 --> 00:14:09,973
Nice to meet you, ashley madison.

269
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:16,508
See, what did I tell you?
Am I not awesome?

270
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:20,066
Do I not provide a valid
and worthwhile public service?

271
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,757
Yes, all that and more.

272
00:14:21,882 --> 00:14:23,862
But you're a damn fine writer too.

273
00:14:24,173 --> 00:14:25,396
So you say.

274
00:14:26,215 --> 00:14:29,311
- But I don't really care about that.
- Well, maybe you should.

275
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:31,661
- Maybe it's another way out.
- Of what?

276
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,398
The hole you're desperately
trying to dig out of.

277
00:14:34,523 --> 00:14:37,937
Maybe not as fast, but the payoff
will last a lot longer, trust me.

278
00:14:38,062 --> 00:14:40,260
You know, I don't know a thing
about you, teach.

279
00:14:40,385 --> 00:14:43,063
Where you grew up,
what you believe in.

280
00:14:43,188 --> 00:14:45,425
But you really have no idea
where I come from.

281
00:14:45,698 --> 00:14:47,148
The shit I've seen.

282
00:14:47,832 --> 00:14:50,055
- All right, well, tell me.
- Why?

283
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:51,973
It's boring as shit.

284
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:55,867
- I don't know, tell me.
- Okay, do you really want to hear

285
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:58,186
about the father that I never knew?

286
00:14:58,311 --> 00:15:00,715
The mother who used to clean
rich people's houses

287
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,390
to get me to college?

288
00:15:03,368 --> 00:15:05,779
Writing is just a...
it's a pipe dream.

289
00:15:06,178 --> 00:15:08,865
You can't really make a living
doing something like that.

290
00:15:09,258 --> 00:15:12,244
Actually, that's how
you end up teaching.

291
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,786
Instead, I would rather
retire my mother, you know.

292
00:15:16,911 --> 00:15:20,264
And if I have to use my body to do so,
then so fucking be it.

293
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:23,639
You know, I appreciate you
trying to help me unleash

294
00:15:23,764 --> 00:15:26,857
my inner hemingway,
but I'm a big girl.

295
00:15:27,328 --> 00:15:29,231
You know, I can take care of myself.

296
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,121
I think you should
really get back into class.

297
00:15:32,246 --> 00:15:34,464
We could workshop
that little story of yours.

298
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,435
I'm not sure I believe a word of it,
but I dig the details.

299
00:15:38,747 --> 00:15:41,004
It was a pleasure meeting you,
Ashley...

300
00:15:41,129 --> 00:15:43,079
- Madison.
- Ashley Madison.

301
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:50,047
Jesus, took you long enough.

302
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:52,242
I'm sorry. I had to call a cab.

303
00:15:52,514 --> 00:15:54,077
What's with the stain?

304
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,455
Don't bother. I don't want to know.

305
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,818
I'm on the rag,
and I'll start screaming.

306
00:15:59,943 --> 00:16:02,669
- I don't want to scream.
- Okay, what can I do?

307
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:06,687
Just make sure your jerk off
paraphernalia is all tucked away.

308
00:16:06,812 --> 00:16:08,305
Gone. Done. What else?

309
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:11,902
That's it.
I think I'm good with that.

310
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,853
So this is it?

311
00:16:15,818 --> 00:16:18,059
- What?
- We're really gonna do this?

312
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,811
Sell the place?

313
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,605
Isn't that what we want?

314
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,023
Yeah, sure, I guess.

315
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:26,120
All of a sudden, a lot of memories
come flooding back.

316
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:29,474
Some bad, but so many good, really.

317
00:16:29,913 --> 00:16:33,578
- Great even.
- Can you stop, charlie? Okay?

318
00:16:33,703 --> 00:16:35,621
'Cause I really don't want
to go traipsing

319
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:37,719
down memory lane with you right now.

320
00:16:37,844 --> 00:16:40,540
Ugh, I gotta go change
my fucking tampon.

321
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,986
Party, yeah. Party with us.

322
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:58,336
- You all right?
- Yeah. Fine.

323
00:16:58,461 --> 00:17:01,019
You know, big girl.
Can take care of myself. Remember?

324
00:17:01,364 --> 00:17:02,364
You sure?

325
00:17:03,371 --> 00:17:05,615
That means you can take off now,
old timer.

326
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,122
I'm not sure I want to.
I'm lonely.

327
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:11,668
What do I have to do to join
this little homoerotic band

328
00:17:11,793 --> 00:17:13,114
of thieves here?

329
00:17:13,918 --> 00:17:16,201
Someone's looking for a mouthful
of cock and balls, huh?

330
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,662
Well, that does not sound
very appetizing or filling.

331
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,993
Oh, shit!
Bruce, Johnny, over here, quick!

332
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,919
- Kick his ass.
- Leave him alone! Stop!

333
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,713
Fuck you!

334
00:17:29,187 --> 00:17:30,637
Hey, Ted, let's go.

335
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:34,986
What were you thinking?

336
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:39,265
Trying to prevent you from getting raped
atop a pinball machine, you ingrate.

337
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,851
They're my regulars.
They're usually sweethearts.

338
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:43,566
Now you tell me.

339
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,105
Are you okay?

340
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,091
No. I just got my ass kicked
by a J. Crew catalog.

341
00:17:48,216 --> 00:17:49,317
I'm not okay.

342
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,606
- What hurts?
- My ass.

343
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,611
Yep, this is where
the magic happens.

344
00:17:54,736 --> 00:17:56,104
Oops, sorry.

345
00:17:56,229 --> 00:17:57,325
Used to happen.

346
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,411
Yeah, we're splitting the sheets.

347
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,193
D-I-V-O-R-S-E.

348
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:03,474
Nothing to be ashamed of.
Things just didn't work out.

349
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:05,293
You know, could happen to anyone.

350
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,618
Even you guys.

351
00:18:07,459 --> 00:18:09,209
Dickless wonder, shut up.

352
00:18:11,943 --> 00:18:13,216
Get it together, you two.

353
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,636
That's disgusting.

354
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:19,347
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

355
00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:24,167
That time of the month.
You know how it is, right, sisters?

356
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,024
Don't worry, we'll make it all nice.

357
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:32,485
I think we've seen everything
we needed to see. Thank you. Good night.

358
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:35,947
Really, Marcy,
a fucking tampon in the toilet,

359
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,700
in this market?
You should be ashamed of yourself.

360
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:40,739
It's going down.

361
00:18:51,502 --> 00:18:52,502
Come on.

362
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:55,432
You're coming in.
I want to take a look at you.

363
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,115
- What about your friend Balt?
- He's sleeping at his boyfriend's.

364
00:19:00,603 --> 00:19:03,607
Oh, he's got a boyfriend?
Good for that dude.

365
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:09,897
Pussy.

366
00:19:10,738 --> 00:19:12,799
What, no points for attempting
to defend your honor,

367
00:19:12,924 --> 00:19:15,926
no matter how ill-conceived
or amateurish the execution?

368
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:21,253
Is that what you were looking for?

369
00:19:21,488 --> 00:19:23,260
Not exactly, but that'll do.

370
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,063
No. No mas.
I'm dizzy enough as it is.

371
00:19:29,188 --> 00:19:30,921
And this is not a good idea.

372
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:32,614
What does that even mean?

373
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,262
You're my student.

374
00:19:34,431 --> 00:19:36,609
Not anymore I'm not.

375
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:40,178
Well, you're a student,
and I am a teacher,

376
00:19:40,303 --> 00:19:43,206
and as such
this is frowned upon somewhat.

377
00:19:46,914 --> 00:19:48,070
Give me a break.

378
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:50,879
You once spent an entire class
ranting about

379
00:19:51,004 --> 00:19:52,854
how much you hate coldplay.

380
00:19:53,374 --> 00:19:55,192
Something tells me that
you could care less

381
00:19:55,317 --> 00:19:57,072
about what's frowned upon.

382
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,570
That's still one
of my favorite lectures.

383
00:20:00,726 --> 00:20:03,315
Shit, you're really weakening
my resolve.

384
00:20:04,468 --> 00:20:06,029
Look, I'm 23.

385
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:08,733
If I'm attracted to you...

386
00:20:11,272 --> 00:20:13,336
If I want to fuck you...

387
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:16,511
- That's really not helping.
- Then what's the big deal?

388
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:24,472
You have really nice boobs.

389
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:27,902
Can I touch one?

390
00:20:30,652 --> 00:20:31,652
Go ahead.

391
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,974
This is so not fair.

392
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:52,959
It's like a slasher film in there.

393
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:54,695
I think I got it all.

394
00:20:56,615 --> 00:20:57,765
Are you okay?

395
00:20:59,564 --> 00:21:02,765
Just leave me the fuck alone,
Runkle, Jesus!

396
00:21:03,122 --> 00:21:04,572
Why are you crying?

397
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:06,881
Why wouldn't I be crying?

398
00:21:07,173 --> 00:21:08,870
I just want to be done
with it already.

399
00:21:08,995 --> 00:21:11,811
I want to sell this fucking house
and get on with the rest of my life.

400
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,217
You should have thought about that

401
00:21:14,342 --> 00:21:16,902
before you left all that
menstrual blood in the toilet.

402
00:21:17,597 --> 00:21:19,625
Would you cut me some slack?

403
00:21:20,216 --> 00:21:22,530
How many big, stinking dumps
have you left

404
00:21:22,655 --> 00:21:24,570
in that very same toilet?

405
00:21:27,045 --> 00:21:29,704
I'm sorry I've made you
so unhappy, Marcy.

406
00:21:32,752 --> 00:21:34,402
Doesn't matter anymore.

407
00:21:35,472 --> 00:21:37,712
- We just weren't meant to be.
- See, that's the thing.

408
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,225
I think we were.

409
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,661
I think we were supposed to live
happily ever after.

410
00:21:41,786 --> 00:21:43,630
I just... I took
a wrong turn somewhere.

411
00:21:43,755 --> 00:21:45,158
Or, okay...

412
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:47,096
several wrong turns.

413
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:48,599
I fucked it up.

414
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:52,085
I'm a big boy, Marcy.

415
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,536
I will do whatever it takes
to make you happy again.

416
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:57,690
And if that means letting you go,
that's what I will do.

417
00:21:57,911 --> 00:21:59,161
Just you watch.

418
00:22:12,355 --> 00:22:14,132
What the fuck is wrong with you?

419
00:22:14,285 --> 00:22:15,974
What happened to letting me go?

420
00:22:16,099 --> 00:22:17,249
I don't know.

421
00:22:17,698 --> 00:22:18,698
It's hard.

422
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:24,934
It sure is.

423
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:27,333
Do that again.

424
00:23:28,237 --> 00:23:30,116
What's up, baby blanket?

425
00:23:31,522 --> 00:23:34,672
I can't seem to drag my ass
out of bed this morning.

426
00:23:35,432 --> 00:23:36,581
I don't know. And you?

427
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:37,934
Can't sleep?

428
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:41,194
<i>No. That bed's awfully big
without you</i>

429
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,069
<i>and your smoking-hot ass.</i>

430
00:23:44,165 --> 00:23:46,391
<i>That's funny, 'cause
you never seem to have</i>

431
00:23:46,516 --> 00:23:49,302
<i>much of a problem getting
someone to share a bed with you.</i>

432
00:23:52,325 --> 00:23:53,801
They ain't you, lady.

433
00:23:53,926 --> 00:23:55,676
<i>So what can I do for you?</i>

434
00:23:56,025 --> 00:23:56,988
That's easy.

435
00:23:57,113 --> 00:23:59,009
You just tell me that despite

436
00:23:59,134 --> 00:24:01,814
all the seemingly shitty things I do,
I'm still a good person.

437
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:05,902
<i>Oh, my, you are having
a dark night of the soul.</i>

438
00:24:06,556 --> 00:24:10,113
I'm just not liking myself
very much lately,

439
00:24:10,238 --> 00:24:12,104
and we're fresh out of booze.

440
00:24:12,229 --> 00:24:15,479
Otherwise I'd sleeping
like a drunk marmoset right now.

441
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,425
<i>So what, you want me
to hear your confession</i>

442
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,700
<i>and absolve you of all your sins?</i>

443
00:24:21,898 --> 00:24:25,069
<i>That's kind of hard to do when I don't
know what you're up to out there.</i>

444
00:24:25,194 --> 00:24:27,256
You want me to give you
the gory deets?

445
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:31,428
<i>God, no. I mean, that's the beauty
of being so far away.</i>

446
00:24:31,657 --> 00:24:34,838
<i>I don't need to listen
to the gory deets anymore.</i>

447
00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:36,589
<i>But thank you.</i>

448
00:24:38,988 --> 00:24:40,561
You make me feel better.

449
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,861
It's what I do.

450
00:24:44,612 --> 00:24:47,696
Listen, much as I would love
to soul search with you,

451
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,904
I need to go.

452
00:24:50,995 --> 00:24:53,834
I get it. It's time
to make the doughnuts, right?

453
00:24:56,218 --> 00:24:57,411
You still love me?

454
00:24:59,486 --> 00:25:01,589
Always.
That's the problem.

455
00:25:02,828 --> 00:25:03,828
Gospel.

456
00:25:04,659 --> 00:25:07,296
- Have a good day.
- <i>Get some sleep, sinner.</i>

457
00:25:07,648 --> 00:25:10,551
And give that little rapscallion
a kiss for me, okay?

458
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,759
Will do, bugaboo.

459
00:25:23,237 --> 00:25:25,111
Top of the morning to you,
miss Robinson.

460
00:25:25,236 --> 00:25:26,991
And you too, mr. Moody.

461
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:29,675
And just so you know,
I've been thinking about it,

462
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,384
and I don't think
we can be friends anymore.

463
00:25:32,646 --> 00:25:34,449
Oh, really? That's too bad.

464
00:25:34,768 --> 00:25:38,661
Not necessarily.
I'm not wearing any underwear.

465
00:25:43,595 --> 00:25:46,177
Professor, would you mind terribly

466
00:25:46,302 --> 00:25:48,431
if I audit your class this morning?

467
00:25:48,656 --> 00:25:52,660
I was thinking you could probably teach
me a thing or two about life, love,

468
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,843
the pursuit of happiness.

469
00:25:56,535 --> 00:25:59,765
I'm sorry I'm late, teach.
Hot date.

470
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,216
You know, up all night
thinking about it.

471
00:26:02,341 --> 00:26:05,747
Just keep on replaying it
over and over and...

472
00:26:06,105 --> 00:26:07,405
over in my mind.
