1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:02,543
<i>Previously on</i> Californication...

2
00:00:02,793 --> 00:00:05,129
This is not a good idea.
You're my student.

3
00:00:05,836 --> 00:00:07,992
I really thought
you were gonna kiss me just then.

4
00:00:09,736 --> 00:00:12,219
I've never stepped outside
of my marriage before.

5
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,437
I am flattered, but I... I'm...

6
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:17,808
Were you just gonna leave me behind?

7
00:00:18,538 --> 00:00:21,437
The gods have seen fit to give me
another shot at the soul mate.

8
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,714
- I gotta be ready for her.
- It's time to stop bangin'

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,193
- the entire college campus.
- Right you are, motherfucker!

10
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,153
You wanted to see me,
Professor Moody?

11
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:32,365
- Look, here's the thing...
- You're trying to end this thing.

12
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,492
- I've been doing some thinking.
- Me, too.

13
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:37,244
- So look, here's the thing.
- You're quitting. I know.

14
00:00:39,408 --> 00:00:41,499
You're doing it, aren't you?
Cashing in your freebie.

15
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,626
- I beg your pardon?
- Fine, I'll do it.

16
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:45,753
You want to throw your life away?
Use me.

17
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:46,971
Please! Go!

18
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:01,771
Come on, show me something.

19
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:03,243
The hint of a nipple,

20
00:01:03,368 --> 00:01:05,856
the suggestion of an areola.
We'll start small,

21
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,503
we'll take it from there.
See how you feel. No pressure...

22
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,899
unless you want to see my schween.

23
00:01:11,024 --> 00:01:13,789
Because I will totally unfurl for you.
I'm not shy.

24
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:17,702
<i>Stop it. Your daughter
could walk in any second.</i>

25
00:01:18,027 --> 00:01:19,427
That's impossible.

26
00:01:20,136 --> 00:01:22,164
<i>It's unlikely,
but it's not impossible,</i>

27
00:01:22,484 --> 00:01:24,775
<i>and I'm convinced she does
not want to see your...</i>

28
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:25,918
<i>schween.</i>

29
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:28,191
Why you gotta talk to me like that?

30
00:01:28,316 --> 00:01:31,622
Besides, there's like 0.0%
chance of that happening.

31
00:01:31,747 --> 00:01:33,423
She's not even on the premises.

32
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:35,518
<i>Where is she?</i>

33
00:01:37,077 --> 00:01:38,182
<i>Where is she?</i>

34
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:40,982
She went down
to the liquor store for me.

35
00:01:42,207 --> 00:01:44,812
I hear the front door.
We're gonna have to skype you later.

36
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,925
<i>- Do not hang up. Hey!</i>
- Honey, you're pixelating.

37
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,250
<i>- She's with them, right?</i>
- What?

38
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,627
<i>- She's with them.</i>
- Them?

39
00:01:52,816 --> 00:01:55,698
They're not an alien race
bent on intergalactic domination.

40
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,200
<i>Well, how do you know that?</i>
Do you have proof?

41
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,602
No, but you're right.
Maybe I should check the grounds.

42
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:04,498
Perhaps there's some sort of portal
somewhere in the topiary.

43
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,084
<i>Okay, I'm gonna sign off.</i>

44
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,852
No, come on.
No virtual sexy time?

45
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:11,714
I'll start, and you can join in
whenever you want.

46
00:02:12,295 --> 00:02:14,713
<i>No, you know what?
You kind of broke the spell.</i>

47
00:02:14,838 --> 00:02:17,005
<i>- You know, you blew it.</i>
- You were against it

48
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,554
when you thought she was in her bedroom,
and now you think

49
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:22,058
she's spending the night
with the Tudors. I can't win with you,.

50
00:02:29,968 --> 00:02:30,968
That's it.

51
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,440
There you go. Oh, yeah, come on.

52
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,890
God damn you, that's unfair,

53
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:42,175
to say nothing of bad
for my prostate.

54
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,914
Skypus interruptus.

55
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,250
Want to party?

56
00:04:40,685 --> 00:04:43,616
Wake up, sleepy head.
You don't want to be late for class.

57
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:48,746
I remember killing that bottle of jack,
but I do not recall you making the sex

58
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,631
with Betty and Veronica here.

59
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:52,417
No, they...

60
00:04:53,128 --> 00:04:55,268
they pretty much
just amuse themselves.

61
00:04:55,393 --> 00:04:56,799
Could you blame a girl though?

62
00:04:56,924 --> 00:04:59,085
It's not like you wanted to have
anything to do with us.

63
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,266
Want has nothing to do with it.
I'm trying to be a good boy, you know?

64
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,511
I don't see what's so good about it.

65
00:05:04,778 --> 00:05:08,807
It's a waste of perfectly lovely
private parts if you ask me.

66
00:05:10,772 --> 00:05:13,354
You never told me what you were
celebrating last night anyway.

67
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,565
Yeah, that. My last dance.

68
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:19,902
- I'm done.
- With what?

69
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:23,447
- The stripping.
- Oh, wow, you don't say.

70
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:25,887
- Really?
- Yep. I'm out.

71
00:05:26,012 --> 00:05:28,911
No more grinding up
on middle-aged hard-ons for me,

72
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:30,621
except for yours, of course.

73
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:32,707
Who you calling middle aged?

74
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,339
You, my old dude boyfriend.

75
00:05:36,395 --> 00:05:38,695
Stop it. You're gonna make me blush.

76
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,881
So what is next for you?

77
00:05:41,138 --> 00:05:43,467
Writing. I'm gonna give it a shot.

78
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,967
I mean, fuck, it's what
makes me the happiest, right?

79
00:05:46,092 --> 00:05:48,889
Who cares if I die
poor, drunk, and alone?

80
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,355
Who's to say that you're not
gonna end up like that anyway?

81
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:56,598
Well, thank you
for showing me the light, teach.

82
00:05:57,019 --> 00:05:59,734
Well, it's been my
pleasure and an honor.

83
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,213
Just happy
that my half-baked wisdom could...

84
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,343
assist you in any way...

85
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:08,534
Don't tell me you're trying
to break up with me again.

86
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,146
To be fair and balanced,
the term "breaking up" implies

87
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,540
that once upon a time,
we were together.

88
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:18,000
So then, just to be clear,

89
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:20,361
the sheer amount
of no-holds-barred sex

90
00:06:20,486 --> 00:06:22,874
that we've been having
recently does not indicate

91
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:24,633
a certain level of intimacy.

92
00:06:24,902 --> 00:06:26,969
Sure. Sure, it does.

93
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,537
What's your point?

94
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:31,614
God, for someone
who loves women so much,

95
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:33,767
you sure don't understand them
very well.

96
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:37,938
I know this seems all bridges
of Madison County right now, but...

97
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,191
It's really just more
of a rite of passage for you.

98
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:44,551
Every comely
college-age undergrad has...

99
00:06:44,764 --> 00:06:47,598
an affair with her favorite
middle-aged professor.

100
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:49,158
Even my old lady had one,

101
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,201
it used to bum me out,
but now I get it.

102
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,038
It's like she was fucking
me before she met me.

103
00:06:56,935 --> 00:06:59,735
Her ass is ringing.
Here, will you hold this?

104
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,077
I should take this somewhere else.
Santa Monica perhaps.

105
00:07:14,202 --> 00:07:16,314
- Tell her I said hi.
- I will not.

106
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:19,354
City morgue.
You kill 'em, we chill 'em.

107
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,523
Hey, did she get off to school okay?

108
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,818
- One would hope. Jesus.
- Well, that's not very comforting.

109
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:27,847
You know, the peoples of the Dean,
they are many things,

110
00:07:27,972 --> 00:07:30,491
but not punctual is not one of them.
Don't worry so much.

111
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:34,112
I tried to check in with her.
I texted, I checked her twitter page.

112
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:35,913
I got nothing. I mean, no response.

113
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,855
We're ruining her life, remember?

114
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,747
Maybe it's game day
for the Crimson Tide.

115
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:41,975
You know how edgy you get
when Aunt Flo's in town.

116
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,463
- Are you trying to piss me off?
- <i>You see?</i>

117
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:48,110
Is it arts and crafts week
at panty camp for you, too?

118
00:07:50,046 --> 00:07:51,053
<i>What was that?</i>

119
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,556
- What was what?
- Someone just said "Hank".

120
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:58,206
No, that was... the cleaning lady.
The cleaning lady, that was.

121
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:01,480
So since when
did we have a cleaning lady?

122
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:03,370
Soon. Recently.

123
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:06,630
She doesn't appear to be dusting.
The place is a mess.

124
00:08:06,755 --> 00:08:08,987
You saw that shit.
It's fucked up. I gotta go.

125
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:11,766
- What the fuck is this?
- She won't wake up.

126
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,243
- Shitness. Is she dead?
- I don't know.

127
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:18,288
That's some intense morning breath.
Cheese doodles and beer...

128
00:08:19,013 --> 00:08:21,551
midnight snack of champions.
She's breathing.

129
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:23,842
- What'd she take?
- No idea.

130
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:27,297
- She's like a walking pharmacy.
- She took some ex. We both did.

131
00:08:41,484 --> 00:08:43,928
- Top of the morning, chumly.
- What the fuck do you want?

132
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,191
- This guy know who I am?
- Of course.

133
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,351
You met at my place, shared a meal,
in fact. Broke some bread.

134
00:08:49,476 --> 00:08:51,113
Why's he being such a douche?

135
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,632
Hey, watch it, Rick Springfield.
I'm in no mood.

136
00:08:53,757 --> 00:08:56,326
Hey, studs, step back.
No need for a cockfight.

137
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,729
We're here to see about the Porsche.
You're selling, Rick's looking to buy.

138
00:08:59,854 --> 00:09:02,752
- We set this up last night, remember?
- Yes, I remember now,

139
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:05,735
but can we reschedule?
I've got a comatose stripper in my bed.

140
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,881
I been there. Can I help?

141
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,182
Man, you hear that?

142
00:09:19,014 --> 00:09:21,935
Nothing like the sound of
a stripper's head on a hardwood floor.

143
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,146
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- What?

144
00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:27,858
Oh, you don't rough 'em up?
Oh, excuse me, George Bailey.

145
00:09:28,145 --> 00:09:30,860
Get a load of this guy.
Last fuckin' boy scout over here.

146
00:09:30,985 --> 00:09:33,113
<i>Jessie is a friend</i>

147
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,782
<i>Yeah, I know he's been
a good friend of mine</i>

148
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,869
Charlie, you gotta get this ass clown
out of here before I start swinging.

149
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,037
Oh, yeah?

150
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,582
You want to throw down, bad boy, huh?
You think you can take this?

151
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:44,833
Guess what?

152
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:46,793
I shit a pint of blood this morning.

153
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:48,504
Why?

154
00:09:49,362 --> 00:09:51,799
Charlie, could you get this girl
out of here for me?

155
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,751
I don't know.
This is kind of dirty business.

156
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:55,469
It's a little shady for me.

157
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,387
The last time I asked you a favor.

158
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,760
What? I got you those reservations
you wanted that time at Mr. Chow's.

159
00:10:00,885 --> 00:10:02,815
Yes, you did, spring of 2003.

160
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,603
I was still with Karen back then.

161
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,623
You think it is easy?
You try it sometime.

162
00:10:06,748 --> 00:10:08,607
Restaurant people can be
very dismissive.

163
00:10:09,382 --> 00:10:11,150
Okay. Here's how it's gonna go.

164
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:14,696
Me and Rick, we're gonna take her to
the ER. We'll leave your name our of it.

165
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,305
And while we're there,

166
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,019
we should really look into
why you're shitting so much blood.

167
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:20,244
Let's go.

168
00:10:22,739 --> 00:10:24,206
Easy does it, easy does it.

169
00:10:26,631 --> 00:10:27,793
Narrow doorway.

170
00:10:28,322 --> 00:10:29,548
Safety first.

171
00:10:29,673 --> 00:10:32,443
- You're Rick Springfield, aren't you?
- That's right, tiny dancer.

172
00:10:32,568 --> 00:10:34,656
You look kind of familiar.
Ever shake your ass for me?

173
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:36,997
No, but my mom did, back in the day.

174
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:40,722
- I think you guys boned.
- She say good things about my ten-inch?

175
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,641
You refused to put a rubber on it.

176
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,769
That's right, baby. Skin on skin,
let the love begin.

177
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,355
Hey, watch what the fuck
you're doing, Rick Springfield.

178
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:53,068
You know what? I've just
about had it with this guy

179
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,778
and his snotty fucking comments.

180
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,322
I will fuck you till
your ass bleeds, cowboy.

181
00:10:58,001 --> 00:11:00,784
Thank God, 'cause I don't think
that's gonna take very long.

182
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
Fuck!

183
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:06,563
Really?

184
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:09,527
Shit.

185
00:11:15,953 --> 00:11:19,350
I know you're in there, Hank Moody.
I heard the footsteps. Open up.

186
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,685
Back in the bedroom.

187
00:11:38,451 --> 00:11:40,340
- Good morning.
- Good mor...

188
00:11:40,465 --> 00:11:42,409
Just stopping by, huh? Look at you.

189
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,620
I figured I'd catch you
before you left for work.

190
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,247
Caught me you did.
You caught me.

191
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,335
It's a pretty safe bet,
considering you're almost always late.

192
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:52,586
You gonna invite me in?

193
00:11:55,265 --> 00:11:58,135
I have something I want to tell you.
I have news, really big news.

194
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,983
But can it wait?
I was just about to jump in the shower.

195
00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:04,139
Oh, perfect. I'll join you,
and tell you in there.

196
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,129
I thought we agreed to stop those
kind of shenanigans. At least for now.

197
00:12:07,254 --> 00:12:09,019
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

198
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,562
I'm gonna grab some coffee.

199
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,754
Would you like some coffee?
'Cause I'm gonna grab...

200
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,408
Not so much. I just brushed
and had a couple of altoids.

201
00:12:15,533 --> 00:12:17,283
Nice, but I'd like a cup.

202
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,413
Go on, go on, and then just meet
me in the boudoir when you get it.

203
00:12:21,538 --> 00:12:22,938
Don't go in there.

204
00:12:23,063 --> 00:12:24,076
Why?

205
00:12:24,864 --> 00:12:26,328
Just please don't.

206
00:12:27,503 --> 00:12:29,373
Do you have a fucking girl in there?

207
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:31,916
Give a guy some credit.

208
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:35,420
Maybe he just laid down
some serious wolf bait.

209
00:12:37,148 --> 00:12:39,549
I just took my morning dump.
It reeks to high heaven in there.

210
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,927
- Lovely.
- Yeah, it was.

211
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,971
An almost perfect bowel movement,
clean as a whistle, barely had to wipe.

212
00:12:46,388 --> 00:12:47,474
But you did, right?

213
00:12:47,794 --> 00:12:49,719
I'm not a fucking
animal. Of course I did.

214
00:12:49,844 --> 00:12:52,314
What was it that
you wanted to talk about, doll?

215
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,876
- Okay, I've been doing some thinking.
- Oh, you mean some over-thinking.

216
00:12:56,001 --> 00:12:57,268
Shut up, you.

217
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,277
You!

218
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:01,629
I accept you.

219
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,407
What?

220
00:13:03,828 --> 00:13:05,784
No, I accept you for who you are.

221
00:13:06,711 --> 00:13:09,121
You accept me. Thanks, I guess.

222
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:12,457
You're not listening, stupid.
I accept you for who you are.

223
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:15,009
I don't want to change you.

224
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:20,257
I think we work well together, you know?
Kid or no kid,

225
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,968
snip or no snip,
I want to be with you.

226
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,346
- I think I spent years idolizing...
- Sure you don't want some coffee?

227
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,515
I think I was in love
with the idea of love.

228
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:29,975
- Tea?
- No, thanks.

229
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:31,810
I like what we have.

230
00:13:32,373 --> 00:13:34,521
- Are you hungry?
- No, but now

231
00:13:34,942 --> 00:13:37,639
I know that I'm in love with you.

232
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,943
I'm in love with you, Hank Moody.

233
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,952
No, don't "but" me.
Don't "but" me now.

234
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,125
Yeah, or I just might butt you back.

235
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,870
Fuck! Okay.

236
00:13:58,641 --> 00:14:01,715
You hold that very naked thought.

237
00:14:13,336 --> 00:14:16,146
- Who is it?
- It's Felicia.

238
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,191
Fuck, yeah. You'll be cool?

239
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,228
Stay in there.

240
00:14:30,448 --> 00:14:32,401
- Good morning.
- Good morning to you.

241
00:14:33,718 --> 00:14:35,473
I can't stop thinking about it.

242
00:14:35,598 --> 00:14:36,598
What?

243
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:38,919
Oh, that.

244
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:41,588
- You liked that, did you?
- I did.

245
00:14:42,325 --> 00:14:45,709
That was some very intense
and powerful love-making, Hank.

246
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:49,172
What's wrong?

247
00:14:49,478 --> 00:14:52,309
Not a big fan of that term...
love-making, making love.

248
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:56,394
I prefer boning, stuffing,
schtupping, banging,

249
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,912
porking, boffing.

250
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:02,147
Anything, take your pick,
just not love-making.

251
00:15:02,272 --> 00:15:04,069
So much for the afterglow.

252
00:15:04,352 --> 00:15:06,906
All right, so what can
I do for you this a.m.?

253
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:10,283
I told him.

254
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:11,667
Him?

255
00:15:14,394 --> 00:15:16,748
Fuck. Please tell me that by "him"
You mean your therapist?

256
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:18,959
No such luck, I'm afraid.

257
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,045
Felicia, why on Earth would
you do something like that?

258
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,576
He knew, Hank.

259
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:26,312
He saw it in my face...
the pure joy,

260
00:15:26,437 --> 00:15:29,678
the glow of a freshly fucked
and properly tended-to woman.

261
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,134
So I told him. I came clean.
It felt so good.

262
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:34,842
It was the right thing to do.

263
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,434
Jesus fuck.

264
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,479
Jesus fuck is right. Guess what?

265
00:15:40,165 --> 00:15:41,231
What?

266
00:15:41,587 --> 00:15:44,276
- I'm leaving him.
- Oh, no! Oh, no, you're not!

267
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,048
Yes, I am. Stacy and I
don't make sense anymore.

268
00:15:47,173 --> 00:15:50,562
We haven't for quite some time now.
And I was thinking, life is short.

269
00:15:50,687 --> 00:15:52,506
Fuck it. I want to spend
the rest of my days

270
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:55,579
with someone I feel passionate about,
someone who gives me butterflies,

271
00:15:55,962 --> 00:15:58,081
and for better or for worse,
Hank, that someone is you.

272
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:00,511
Just slow the fuck down.

273
00:16:00,636 --> 00:16:03,459
One session of love-making,
now matter how inspired or transcendent,

274
00:16:03,584 --> 00:16:05,880
does not a relationship make.
What about the Chelsea?

275
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:08,598
- What about her?
- I don't care how bratty or snotty

276
00:16:08,723 --> 00:16:11,136
that little shit is.
She doesn't deserve a broken home.

277
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,930
Oh, she'll get over it.
Becca's clearly weathered the storm.

278
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,833
No, she hasn't. She's totally fucked up.
Karen and I made a huge mistake.

279
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,145
We should have stayed
together at all costs for her.

280
00:16:20,428 --> 00:16:22,292
But we were stubborn,
and we were foolish,

281
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:24,521
- retarded, we were young.
- Why don't you just shut up

282
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:26,276
and make love to me already?

283
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:29,863
Or you can fuck me, bang me,
stuff me. Take your pick.

284
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,327
- Who's that?
- That'd be my agent,

285
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:37,260
my representation.

286
00:16:38,763 --> 00:16:41,514
Charlie Runkle, Felicia Koons.

287
00:16:43,186 --> 00:16:44,486
The Dean's wife.

288
00:16:44,611 --> 00:16:45,611
Oh, shit.

289
00:16:46,121 --> 00:16:49,007
- Nice to meet you, missus.
- Lovely to meet you.

290
00:16:53,954 --> 00:16:55,304
So where were we?

291
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:58,433
I was leaving my husband for you.

292
00:17:01,881 --> 00:17:03,231
Hold on a second.

293
00:17:13,952 --> 00:17:16,178
Come on, man,
you want to get in on this?

294
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:17,806
You guys are fucking foul.

295
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:19,663
You sure? We got an open hole.

296
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:21,706
Sweetheart, you okay?

297
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:24,944
Don't worry. They're paying for it...
handsomely.

298
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:27,337
Well, I'm paying for it
very handsomely.

299
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,306
I left my wallet at home.
Don't be such a fucking schnorr, Runkle.

300
00:17:30,431 --> 00:17:33,259
Jesus. I'm losing my wood.
Come on, say it, baby, say it.

301
00:17:33,993 --> 00:17:36,331
I'm getting fucked
by Rick Springfield.

302
00:17:37,095 --> 00:17:39,808
<i>You better love somebody</i>

303
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,135
<i>Oh, I think you better love somebody</i>

304
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,300
You okay out here?
What are you doing?

305
00:17:47,425 --> 00:17:49,526
- What does it look like?
- That?

306
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,987
My apartment's full of classics,
you gotta go with that one?

307
00:17:52,256 --> 00:17:54,531
What's the big deal?
I've heard good things.

308
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,366
Yeah? Well, what do you
think? Thoughts, criticisms?

309
00:17:57,491 --> 00:18:00,496
- What do you got?
- I like it a lot. She's a good writer.

310
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,205
My kind of girl obviously.

311
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:04,487
So, can we leave yet?

312
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,325
No, I still got some fires
to put out.

313
00:18:08,757 --> 00:18:10,463
Are you proud of me for quitting?

314
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,681
Absolutely.

315
00:18:12,128 --> 00:18:13,591
You done good, kiddo.

316
00:18:13,837 --> 00:18:14,837
Thanks.

317
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,347
We're not done with the boyfriend
girlfriend conversation just yet.

318
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,150
Hello, Hank.

319
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:35,864
- Morning, Stacy.
- The front door was open.

320
00:18:36,385 --> 00:18:39,066
I can be very neighborly that way.

321
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,203
You never called me Stacy before.
Wonder why.

322
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,956
Don't know. Just kind of rolled
trippingly off the tongue this morning.

323
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,293
Oh, something must be different.
Oh, that's right. You fucked my wife.

324
00:18:50,855 --> 00:18:52,922
- Well, there's that.
- What could you say?

325
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,576
What could you possibly say, Hank,

326
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,595
to take away the hurt and
the pain of being cuckolded?

327
00:19:00,695 --> 00:19:02,873
I got nothin'. I got nothin' at all.

328
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,484
I'm sorry. The well is dry.

329
00:19:06,793 --> 00:19:09,481
You should hit me. You want to?
Head, gut... it doesn't matter.

330
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,206
- It's only fair.
- No, I don't want to hit you, Hank.

331
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:14,569
I just want to try to understand,
how do you do it?

332
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,820
Do what?

333
00:19:16,146 --> 00:19:18,352
Well,
you obviously have this... this...

334
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:22,191
this thing with women,
some very strong connection,

335
00:19:22,316 --> 00:19:25,540
that no matter what you do,
no matter how big of an ass you are,

336
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,625
they seem to respond.
You're a goddamn girl whisperer.

337
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,378
Have you listened to your wife
lately?

338
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:35,182
Because she gives every indication
of being a woman scorned.

339
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,759
Now, far be it from me to poke
my nose into the Dean's business,

340
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,053
but it seems to me
like you hurt her first.

341
00:19:41,396 --> 00:19:42,896
You're right, I did.

342
00:19:43,674 --> 00:19:45,274
I was weak. I cheated.

343
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:49,229
Stepped outside my marriage.
Humiliated my better half.

344
00:19:49,886 --> 00:19:50,772
It happens.

345
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,442
But she was so hot, Hank,
this student of mine.

346
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,401
- You should have seen her.
- Dean-O.

347
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,577
A priest would have
defiled this girl.

348
00:19:57,702 --> 00:20:00,114
You might want to keep
those kind of details to yourself.

349
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,032
Oh, Felicia is wonderful.

350
00:20:02,497 --> 00:20:04,786
A beautiful wife,
a beautiful mother.

351
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,112
I was in love with her
the 1st moment I set eyes on her.

352
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:08,749
I knew she was the one.

353
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,182
She was always a little reserved
in the sack. The British, you know.

354
00:20:12,307 --> 00:20:14,221
There was never a surplus of oral,

355
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,132
and whatever there was dried
up right after the wedding.

356
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:19,926
- I never understood that.
- Yeah. Here you go.

357
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,210
A man likes to get his dick sucked.
Well, you know.

358
00:20:22,335 --> 00:20:25,659
Maybe if you took a goddamn
shower once in a while.

359
00:20:26,061 --> 00:20:28,167
Do you really think a woman
wants to go down on a man

360
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:29,978
who just walked in
off the tennis court?

361
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:31,938
Or just came in from a ride?

362
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:35,316
You think I want to peel off those
sweaty bike shorts and go to town?

363
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,318
- Disgusting!
- I'm sorry, Felicia,

364
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,394
but that just so happens to be
when this man is at his horniest.

365
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:44,033
- You know that.
- Have you heard of compromise, Stacy?

366
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,036
Compromise...
I like where this is going.

367
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,107
Divorce court...
that's where this is going.

368
00:20:48,232 --> 00:20:51,851
What are you doing here anyway?
A free pass means once... no repeat.

369
00:20:51,976 --> 00:20:53,760
We're gonna be
discussing this in therapy.

370
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,893
That's an excellent idea.
Therapize the fuck out of this shit.

371
00:20:57,018 --> 00:20:59,132
- You're coming with us, Hank.
- That's an awful idea.

372
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,426
It is awful.
Do you know how much of my life

373
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,470
I've wasted on that couch pretending
we can just jabber through our issues?

374
00:21:04,745 --> 00:21:06,586
No more, Stacy. No more.

375
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,058
I'm in love with someone else.

376
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,438
Are you in love with my wife, Hank?

377
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:18,401
That's a ridiculous question.

378
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:21,738
Well, she seems to be in love with you.
Do you feel the same?

379
00:21:23,735 --> 00:21:25,158
Feel the same?

380
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,000
Do you love her?

381
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,167
What do we have here?

382
00:21:37,292 --> 00:21:38,713
What are you doing home?

383
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,840
School closed?
What is it, a snow day?

384
00:21:41,138 --> 00:21:43,325
- What are you guys doing here?
- I believe that question

385
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,762
- should be directed at you.
- Copy that, motherfucker.

386
00:21:45,996 --> 00:21:48,723
I left one of my books here.
I needed it.

387
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:51,893
Well, you could have called me.
I would have brought it to you.

388
00:21:52,146 --> 00:21:53,978
I'm gonna take you
right back to school

389
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,481
right now, you little guttersnipe.
No more of your double-talk.

390
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,023
I'm taking your lying, no-account ass
back to school, pronto.

391
00:21:59,148 --> 00:22:02,278
- Excellent idea. Let's go, Chelsea.
- Wait a second. Why are you guys here?

392
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,238
Actually,
we were chatting about you.

393
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,463
We were talking
about your offensive behaviors,

394
00:22:07,588 --> 00:22:11,125
which apparently seem now
to be not so unjustified, do they?

395
00:22:18,867 --> 00:22:20,698
- Dad?
- Yes, daughter?

396
00:22:21,683 --> 00:22:24,183
Why is there a naked lady
in my bedroom?

397
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:26,386
Is that my kimono?

398
00:22:27,962 --> 00:22:29,055
Way to go, Hank.

399
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,223
Oh, my God.

400
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:34,435
Were you sleeping with your T.A. the
whole time you were sleeping with me?

401
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,895
What? Mom!

402
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,690
- To be fair, it was only the once.
- Bullshit.

403
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,025
No, I was referring to flea and I.

404
00:22:41,256 --> 00:22:43,778
- I counted three times.
- All in one night doesn't count.

405
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,791
Your dad's fucking my mom.

406
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,765
Dad, anything to say about this?

407
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:51,494
- This calls for a family meeting.
- Good thinking.

408
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:53,162
What is it?

409
00:22:58,124 --> 00:23:00,712
- What the fuck?
- Is that Rick Springfield?

410
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,714
You bet your khaki-clad ass,
white man.

411
00:23:03,405 --> 00:23:05,466
- Holy shit.
- You a fan?

412
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,927
- Where that fire extinguisher?
- What's up, sweetheart?

413
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:13,016
You're kidding.

414
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,894
Tell me you've not been
fucking her this entire time.

415
00:23:16,471 --> 00:23:18,569
Not in front of the children.
And not last night.

416
00:23:18,694 --> 00:23:21,049
I was an officer and a gentleman.
You tell her.

417
00:23:21,174 --> 00:23:23,568
- Are these my pants?
- Wait, who else has he been fucking?

418
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:26,738
You?

419
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,156
Oh, gross.

420
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,908
- Sorry, man, I just...
- So you, too, then?

421
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,077
God, no. Thanks.
He's just fucking my mom.

422
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,603
- Chelsea, watch your mouth.
- Dad, man up and grow a pair already.

423
00:23:36,728 --> 00:23:38,583
You're gonna let this asshole
steal your wife?

424
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:41,904
- That's my father you're talking about.
- Thank you, Becca.

425
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:45,006
- Did I quit stripping for you?
- I still think it's a solid move.

426
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,763
Now, if you'll all excuse me,

427
00:23:46,888 --> 00:23:49,588
I appear to have
an actual fire to put out.

428
00:23:51,605 --> 00:23:53,890
- Sorry about that, dude.
- That's Rick Springfield.

429
00:24:37,237 --> 00:24:39,086
We should really get you to school.

430
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,521
I can't believe you
slept with all of them.

431
00:24:41,922 --> 00:24:44,190
It's not that simple, sweetheart.

432
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:45,691
All of them.

433
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:48,595
Yes, I suppose I did. Yeah.

434
00:24:49,581 --> 00:24:50,581
Why?

435
00:24:50,842 --> 00:24:52,990
I don't know. I don't know.

436
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,038
That's not good enough.
I want to know why.

437
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:59,038
There has to be a reason.
Make me understand.

438
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,585
- It just sort of happened.
- Why do you do things like that?

439
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:08,089
Because I'm an idiot, obviously.

440
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,859
No, you're not allowed
to feel sorry for yourself,

441
00:25:10,984 --> 00:25:12,235
not right now.

442
00:25:12,996 --> 00:25:14,345
You need to talk to me.

443
00:25:15,088 --> 00:25:17,239
You need to tell me why
you do the things you do

444
00:25:17,364 --> 00:25:19,802
when you know that people
can get seriously hurt,

445
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,186
myself included.

446
00:25:23,653 --> 00:25:26,347
God damn it, I hate it
when you're mad at me.

447
00:25:26,648 --> 00:25:28,025
I'm not mad at you.

448
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:32,168
You wouldn't get mad at a big, dumb dog
for shitting on the rug, would you?

449
00:25:32,293 --> 00:25:35,158
I would, but I'm a harsh taskmaster.
That's just me.

450
00:25:35,415 --> 00:25:38,161
What do you want me to take away
from this, from how you treat women?

451
00:25:39,273 --> 00:25:42,123
Is that all they are to you,
walking vaginas?

452
00:25:47,621 --> 00:25:49,821
There's no excuse for my behavior.

453
00:25:51,105 --> 00:25:53,982
There's no defense if somebody
got hurt, especially you.

454
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:57,763
But I need you to know that I started
out with the best of intentions.

455
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,624
I guess I just wanted
them all to see it,

456
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:04,271
the thing that makes them special.

457
00:26:05,763 --> 00:26:09,108
I guess that's all anybody wants
is to be seen, to be recognized.

458
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:12,897
Then the lines get blurry,

459
00:26:13,022 --> 00:26:15,934
and the fact that your mom and
I are in such a weird place.

460
00:26:19,005 --> 00:26:21,803
Yeah. Hence, the big stinking mess.

461
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:26,584
But I'm sorry
if I let you down, sweetie,

462
00:26:28,431 --> 00:26:30,656
I don't know how much more
I'll be able to say I'm sorry

463
00:26:30,781 --> 00:26:33,619
before it doesn't mean
anything anymore.

464
00:26:35,574 --> 00:26:37,124
I don't know, either.

465
00:26:38,213 --> 00:26:41,047
But I have this funny
feeling we're gonna find out.

466
00:26:50,215 --> 00:26:51,265
Hey, honey.

467
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,108
She's... at school...

468
00:26:56,106 --> 00:26:57,862
receiving her education.

469
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,543
Yeah, I'm gonna pick her up

470
00:27:00,928 --> 00:27:02,802
and take her to get some ice cream,

471
00:27:03,365 --> 00:27:05,414
shoot the shit, bridge the gap,

472
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,207
just like old times.

473
00:27:11,314 --> 00:27:12,914
Well, I love you, too.

474
00:27:13,727 --> 00:27:15,027
Skype you later?

475
00:27:21,858 --> 00:27:24,780
Where are my fucking clothes?
