1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,630
Previously on "Californication"...

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,050
it's not a memoir.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,540
It's a written account of my
sexual relationship with you.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,520
Written by me as a fuckin' novel.

5
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,040
Even I'm confused, and
i stole the damn thing.

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,310
Holy guacamole!

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,010
You hocked everything. Is that it?

8
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,100
I need to fess up, okay?
It's part of the process.

9
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,710
Are you ready to have
the time of your life?

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,450
I'm king of fuck mountain!

11
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,850
- I don't want to do any more porn.
- Really?

12
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,840
You know, if I can't
actually be with you, charlie,

13
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:34,020
I'd kind of like the last person
I had on-screen sex with to be you.

14
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,750
- Who are you?
- Damien.

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,040
Call me "he who will kill you
if you touch his daughter."

16
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,710
- She's pretty awesome.
- She is.

17
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,690
Hi, you don't know me. My name
is hank moody. I'm a writer.

18
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,130
I want to ask you a question
about lew -- lew ashby.

19
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,610
Get the pen.

20
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,980
Oh, I hate when that happens.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,030
You're an asshole!

22
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,370
But we haven't even dated.

23
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,780
Just in time.

24
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,250
So, lew, it's been real.

25
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,020
Yikes. We're gonna shake hands?

26
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,710
Yes, we are.

27
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,610
What the fuck?

28
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,680
Life's just too fucking
boring not to try.

29
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,690
Hey, you know, he throws
these, uh, huge parties.

30
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,390
- Yeah, I've heard.
- Guest of honor never shows.

31
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,360
Wakey, wakey... eggs and bakey.

32
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,190
Come on! Wake up! We got to
get the kids to school already!

33
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,480
Oh, christ, mia. What are
you -- what are you doing?

34
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,920
Did you fondle me?

35
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,550
I don't know. Do you feel fondled?

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,010
I do a little bit. Get off. It's
way too early for your shenanigans.

37
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,670
But not for this --
our review in the times.

38
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,620
I had to go all the way to one of
those old-man newsstands to get it.

39
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,230
Why do they still have those, anyway?

40
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,330
What, old men or newsstands?

41
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,600
Let's read it together.

42
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,190
No, thank you. I don't
want to hear that shit.

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,290
Of course you want to hear that shit.

44
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,640
Do you know how long it's been since
you've actually had something published?

45
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,910
All right. Here it goes.

46
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,070
"At 17, mia cross has
everything most girls want."

47
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,840
Stop. I told you I
didn't want to hear it.

48
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,580
Now, what are you
even doing here anyway?

49
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,710
I thought lew gave you... the speech.

50
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,250
The one about how special I am
and how we'll always be friends?

51
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,590
Yes, that one.

52
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,560
He did. And I pretended to be sad.

53
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,020
He let me have my book
party here this afternoon.

54
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,460
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!

55
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,700
Holy shit, shit, shit!

56
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,950
"A strangely poignant coming-of-age story "written
with the self-assurance of a much older writer.

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,810
"In the end, the book's true
subject "isn't sex but loneliness.

58
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,090
"It's hauntingly, hopelessly romantic
in the best sense of the word."

59
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,950
That's good, right?

60
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,420
Well, I'll be dipped in dog shit.

64
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,050
Christ, this may be the best
review you've ever gotten.

65
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,860
You're not helping.

66
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,390
What do you want me to do,

67
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,130
have it laminated so you can carry it around in
your wallet for the rest of your natural-born days?

68
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,130
Have you seen your old assistant?

69
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,840
She can go fuck herself.

70
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,380
Not all women are like that,
you know -- conniving, vicious...

71
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,040
willing to walk all over a
man to get what they want.

72
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,380
I forget. Is that one of the
things you guys did together?

73
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,970
Take daisy, for instance.

74
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,710
Oh, jesus, not this shit again.

75
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,460
Yes, this again.

76
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,560
Tell you, man, being with her just -- it reminds me
of everything that's simple and good in the world.

77
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,950
- She's not returning your phone calls, shit for brains.
- Because she's got too much integrity.

78
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,890
Okay.

79
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,400
She knows marcy's home from rehab.

80
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,870
She thinks we should cool
it... Take a breather.

81
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,230
Integrity -- that's a
fine quality in a mistress.

82
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,420
Be careful.

83
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,830
What, I shouldn't say anything bad about her because
next year we might all be sitting down to seder with her?

84
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,560
Not on my watch, runkle. You don't abandon
a woman who stood by you thick and thin,

85
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,650
20 years, the minute
she gets out of rehab.

86
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,230
No, you wait 90 days.

87
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,470
I looked that shit up.
That's the decent thing to do.

88
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,520
Oh, I know.

89
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,950
The marce.

90
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,230
This place is so different in the
light of day -- not so ominous.

91
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,210
Hey, so what'd you think of the reading?

92
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,390
Honestly, I could not be more surprised.

93
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,700
I know. Who knew the
little vixen could write?

94
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,580
So, what surprised you was
the basic goodness of it?

95
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,080
Well, I haven't read the whole book.
I mean, I just read the passage, so...

96
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,000
so good, not excellent?

97
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,420
We have a question.

98
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,310
Fire away.

99
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,490
- Mom says we're not old enough to stay for the party.
- Right.

100
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,600
What do you think?

101
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,910
Oh, so it's a trick question,
bit of a hand grenade.

102
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,980
I'd kind of like to meet lew ashby.

103
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,130
Really? Here's a tip -- don't
give him one of your demos.

104
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,170
Come on, mom. Where's the
trust? Let us live a little.

105
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,910
There's a rumor afloat that
roger daltrey might show.

106
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,960
Okay, we'll stay for a little
bit, just a little while, okay?

107
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,200
All right. Have fun, children.
Long live rock 'n' roll.

108
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:43,080
I think that was a -- that was
a good decision. Solid parenting.

109
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,650
Club soda with a twist.

110
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,790
Alcohol is still okay for me, right?

111
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,990
You do what you have to do.

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,340
People who live in fear need
to be chemically altered.

113
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,770
Okay. So what am i so afraid of, then?

114
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,890
How the fuck should I know?

115
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,860
But you've been scarfing those things like
the stress-eater mama runkle raised you to be.

116
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,460
Hey, there's dani. I need to
talk to her. She's on my list.

117
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,770
No, no. No fucking way, okay?

118
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,830
Her we do not forgive, nor
do we ask her forgiveness.

119
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,440
You can't tell me who I can
and cannot make amends to.

120
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,960
Yes. Yes, I can.

121
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,950
We, as a family, do not forgive her.

122
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,270
All the bad shit that's
happened to us -- she started it.

123
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,360
She's the cause of it.
She's the outbreak monkey.

124
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,870
Did you see that girl with the
spicy shrimp rolls go through there?

125
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,500
Okay, okay. Upstairs, people.
You just do the drugs upstairs.

126
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,630
For fuck's sake, there's
children present, okay?

127
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,110
- So just move it on up, okay? Just move it on up.
- Mother mary.

128
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,050
That wouldn't happen to
be cocaine there, would it?

129
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,040
Cocaine, meth. I think this is heroin.

130
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,770
Some people really
have problems, you know?

131
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,160
I had to remortgage our house
in order to send her to passages.

132
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,020
You know what I'm saying?

133
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,370
Hey, next time let me
know. I know people.

134
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,010
I can hook you up,
arrange a little discount.

135
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,080
"Next time"?

136
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,880
Yeah, there's always a next time.

137
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,020
You keep working those steps, baby girl.

138
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:08,220
Got a little something that david crosby once
told me -- a little pot -- it's not cheating, huh?

139
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,440
I deeply and profoundly love myself.

140
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,230
I deeply and profoundly love myself.

141
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,530
Hey, there he is -- not so fast, you.
Look who's here. It's annika staley.

142
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,180
From rolling stone magazine.
Hello. Pleasure to see you again.

143
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,970
How are the toe cramps?

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,110
Annika has an interesting little theory about
the book that she's been sharing with us.

145
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,700
A literary theory?
None for me, thank you.

146
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,440
Well, I was just saying
how, when I reread the book,

147
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,580
it just became completely obvious to me
that your fingerprints are all over it.

148
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,900
My -- my fingerints? My -- my
stylistic fingerprints, my style.

149
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,720
No, come on. Her style's
much more fluid than yours.

150
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,670
I mean -- I mean you --
your personality, your, uh --

151
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,430
your tics, that sense of
humor of yours, you know.

152
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,860
Come on. It's you, isn't it?

153
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,030
Excuse me?

154
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,410
The guy in the book. It's a memoir.

155
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,540
It's obviously based
on some real person.

156
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,280
I-I-I see no reason to assume
something like that nowadays, you know.

157
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,400
How about -- how about all these
people passing off their novels

158
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,380
as true stories just because nobody
gives a fuck about fiction anymore?

159
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
I find that fascinating.

160
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,950
- Yeah, that's totally
boring.But -- - Not to me.

161
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,730
but a sexy older man who seduces a
teenage girl, not knowing she's a teenager.

162
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,820
Is that what this thing's
about? I got to get me a copy.

163
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:29,330
Come on. Admit it. You guys obviously
had some kind of A... relationship, right?

164
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,370
Annika, I think you're working
a little too hard tonight.

165
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,050
How about we go meet zakk wylde?

166
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,990
Who's zakk wylde?

167
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:41,830
Excuse us. I have to throw this
chick out of my party. Come on.

168
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,910
What the fuck are you doing?
You think this is funny?

169
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,750
Uh, so she maybe writes a
little blurb about us. So what?

170
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,250
It's not like they're gonna make you
go live in france with roman polanski.

171
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,860
It'll just be one of those hypothetical,
"guess which washed-up novelist?" Things.

172
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,550
Yeah. I don't think karen is
ever gonna look at it that way.

173
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,220
She'll get over it... eventually.

174
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,490
And it could be great publicity
for your book about ashby.

175
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,680
Look, mia, not everybody that picks
up a pen sweats blood for publicity.

176
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,070
You've got to disabuse
annika of this perspective.

177
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,700
She believes what she believes.

178
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,770
And it's your own damn fault.

179
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,070
You shouldn't have given her
such a mind-blowing orgasm.

180
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,860
What? That's what this is
about -- I didn't call her back?

181
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,450
There was no repeat performance?

182
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,290
No. I mean that that's
what tipped her off.

183
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,640
She said that the real-life fucking
seemed a lot like the fucking in the book.

184
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,460
What?

185
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,590
Minus the punching, of course, so you
may want to get some new moves now.

186
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,900
If you'll excuse me, I'm
gonna go enjoy my party.

187
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,450
I think I may be over
my thing with older men.

188
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,300
I mean, ever since I started
meditating -- don't say anything --

189
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,050
oh, my god.

190
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,630
I'm more in touch with the
emotions of the people around me.

191
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,980
I'm not so ego-focused.

192
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,460
Well, you sound like -- well,
okay. That's good, sweetie.

193
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,210
That's -- that's -- that's progress,
right? That's why you went there.

194
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:09,880
Did hank say anything to you about charlie
getting up to any weird shit while I was away?

195
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,690
No. What?

196
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,090
Well, you know, he's stress-eating,

197
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,500
and he's not pawing at me
or pressuring me for sex.

198
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,650
Well, thank god,
right?I mean --

199
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,340
well, he seems restless.

200
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,630
Well, honey, what about you?

201
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,570
I have inner peace, baby.
I see what's important.

202
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:37,030
And by being loyal and faithful to charlie,
I attract that same shit back into my life.

203
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,580
That's how the universe works.

204
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,040
I'm very proud of you.

205
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,610
- You like that?
- Yes, I do.

206
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,390
- Oh, yeah, come on.
- It's progress.

207
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,860
Hey, not that way. Come.

208
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,220
Why? Are there drugs
that way? I'm strong.

209
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,350
- I can handle it.
- No. I'm not strong.

210
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,700
Come on, let's go.

211
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,270
What? It's just lew ashby.

212
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,550
Well, right. I don't want to,
like, fan the flames, you know.

213
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,490
What? He burns for you? Shit.

214
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,870
I missed a lot, didn't I?

215
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,670
No, you did not. He -- he's
like a toddler, you know.

216
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,210
He sees something shiny in his
midst, and he -- he kind of wants it.

217
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,960
You are shiny. Of course he does.

218
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,070
- Oh, my god.
- What?

219
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,490
- Oh, my god! Look! Look, look, look!
- What?

220
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,530
I've been trying to give them
space -- it's damien and becca.

221
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,340
- Where?
- Right there!

222
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,470
Not everyone is freakishly tall!

223
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,790
Okay. Can you see? That's sweet, isn't ?

224
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,870
- No?
- Not really so sweet, no.

225
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,050
- Why not?
- Because isn't that the becca right there?

226
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,980
- That would be.
- Oh, my god. Take it.

227
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:48,620
Oh, hey, bec! Come
here. Oh, no. Oh, god.

228
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,920
I'm the best me I can possible be.

229
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,380
I'm the best me I can possible be.

230
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,910
I tell you, I'm just
fresh out of answers.

231
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,990
Maybe marcy's right, you know.

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,440
Maybe we all just need to surrender
to some higher power, you know, just --

233
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,730
just be clear and let go.

234
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,920
Fuck that. You sound like julian.

235
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,780
Well, maybe julian's on to something.

236
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,500
Guy gets more pussy
than either one of us.

237
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,220
Either one of us? Who are you fucking
besides your wife and a porn star?

238
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,380
Mind if I join you guys?

239
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,310
- Yes.
- No. No. Pull up a chair.

240
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,060
You've always had a unique ability
to talk sense into this man.

241
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,860
Don't mind if I do.

242
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,200
So, what compromising position has
he gotten himself into this time?

243
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,110
Well, it seems that his new career
in porn is not enough for him.

244
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,840
He also has to marry the porn star,
save her from her road to ruin.

245
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,030
Apparently he's never seen "star 80."

246
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,170
- What about marcy?
- What about marcy?

247
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,340
- Here's a thought.
- What about marcy?

248
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,560
Maybe the two people in this conversation who
have never been married should shut the fuck up

249
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,810
and not pass judgment
on the one who has.

250
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,460
Here's a thought right back at you.

251
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,040
Maybe marcy's not the problem.

252
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,710
I never said she was.

253
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,230
"Damn my coke addict of a wife," I've
heard you say on several occasions.

254
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,910
Mm, it seems to me you've traveled a long road to
end up right back where you were nine months ago --

255
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,080
enthralled to some much younger woman who allows
you to feel like you're completely in control --

256
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,370
a master of the universe, if you will.

257
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,310
Or in his case, a masturbator
of the universe, if you will.

258
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,700
Who knows?

259
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,880
Maybe it's your destiny, charlie runkle.

260
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,370
- Maybe you were born to dominate...
- oh, no.

261
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:34,600
In which case, my advice to you is embrace
it, be who you are, let your freak flag fly.

262
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,860
Interesting.

263
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,100
Becca, come on, sweetie.
Just let me in. Come on.

264
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,920
What the hell? Somebody better
not be doing coke in there.

265
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,720
- Oh, sorry. -
It's -- it's becca.

266
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,410
Is she okay?

267
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:52,520
She found that asshole boyfriend of
hers making out with another girl.

268
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,230
Becca. It's lew ashby.

269
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,620
Oh, well, that's just gonna do it.

270
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,590
Becca, I know things are feeling
pretty shitty right now --

271
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,110
crappy, whatever.

272
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:11,960
But, uh, in two weeks, slipknot's at
the forum, and if you open up this door,

273
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,960
let your mother in the bathroom,
you're there, backstage.

274
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,490
You're at the freakin'
sound check, okay?

275
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,550
You know what? That's really sweet,
but my daughter cannot be bribed.

276
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:27,150
Not you... him.

277
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,730
Okay.

278
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,680
I'm really sorry. She's going
through some stuff, so...

279
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:41,750
it's recently come to my attention
that men cannot be trusted.

280
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,360
Truer words have never been spoken.

281
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:50,070
Can you provide any assurance that you'll
follow through on this extravagant promise?

282
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,250
Can you provide any assurance you're actually
gonna let your mother into the bathroom?

283
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,610
No.

284
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:00,270
So, I guess we have no choice
but to, uh, trust each other.

285
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,860
Look.

286
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,530
It's gonna take that dude 15 years
before he realizes what he's missing.

287
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:25,850
He's missing a lot, 'cause
you're fucking magic.

288
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,320
And if that's too long to wait,

289
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,690
I can always get lemmy from motorhead to
cut off his cheeks with a straight razor.

290
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,350
Totally up to you.

291
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,390
Good?

292
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,300
Shake it off, princess.

293
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,570
She's all yours.

294
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,890
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

295
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,990
Hey, you. What'd he say?

296
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,080
I'll never tell.

297
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,110
Come here.

298
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,670
So, I guess I'm the
biggest loser of all time.

299
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,850
Not even close.

300
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:28,080
Trusting someone does not make you into
a loser, okay, 'cause you took a leap.

301
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,590
Into a brick wall.

302
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,320
And that's why it hurts so much.

303
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:36,410
And all you can do is... let it hurt.

304
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,870
Look who I found!

305
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,640
- Daisy.
- Hi, baby.

306
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,630
- Oh, so this is daisy.
- Yeah.

307
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,090
Daisy, hank. Hank, daisy. You see that?

308
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,650
Everybody really does
come to lew ashby'S.

309
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,930
Have you seen the entire house,
all the nooks and crannies?

310
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,920
- I could give you a guided tour.
- No, no, no.

311
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,190
You're not squirreling her
away. No. I just found her.

312
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,760
So, what's the haps?

313
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,750
Oh, nothing much. Just
same old, same old.

314
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,890
Next guided tour leaving in 30 seconds.
Come on, we can talk about your work.

315
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,600
I'm not a big fan of porn myself, but I was
-- don't get me wrong -- in my formative years.

316
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,230
Daisy, what? You came
here all alone? What?

317
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,960
Oh, no, no, no. She came with ronny.

318
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,100
Where the fuck did he just get off to?

319
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,070
- Ronny!
- Ronny.

320
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,810
Well, I'm not with ronny.
He was coming tonight.

321
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,160
Thought it'd be fun to tag along,
so -- thought you guys might be here.

322
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,910
I know lew ashby's
parties are really famous.

323
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,770
Ronny!

324
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,160
Oi, oi. How did I
know I'd find you here?

325
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,330
Runkle, how you doing?

326
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,900
Hank moody, ronny praeger, the very
gifted auteur behind "vaginatown."

327
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,000
Oh, I'm honored. I'm a big fan.

328
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:52,670
What is next for you, "a cock-work orange,"
or perhaps "2069: A sit-on-my-face odyssey"?

329
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,270
That's actually not too fucking bad.

330
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,080
We've actually been talking
about it, haven't we, sweet tits?

331
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,770
We've decided on "network."

332
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,100
Oh, "network."

333
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,950
No. What are you
talking about -- daisy?

334
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,120
She didn't tell you? Daisy
is getting out of porn.

335
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,330
- You are?
- Daisy's ,re porn's over there.

336
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,020
- Uh, you know, I'm giving it some thought.
- No.

337
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,700
What kind of shit-for-brains
agent gave you that advice?

338
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,880
That's terrible advice!

339
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,600
I mean, seriously, when you've got 100%
usda choice beef like that slappin' about,

340
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,380
you don't let it get to the freezer.

341
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,280
Just back off, buddy, would you?

342
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,860
Okay? The decision's been made.

343
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,220
Daisy doesn't want to do any more porn.

344
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,160
And maybe you should just get your paws
off her, you know, give her a little space.

345
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,720
What the fuck do you
care where his paws are?

346
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,990
I don't think a girl should be handled
like that against her will -- that's all.

347
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,740
- It's fine.
- It's fine?

348
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,310
It's fine he touches you? It's
fine you're out on a date with him?

349
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,250
It's fine that -- that he's planning
the rest of your life for you?

350
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,190
What? What? I mean, what about us?

351
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,680
Excuse me?

352
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,260
- Professionally speaking.
- Charlie, you look like you need a refill.

353
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,250
- You look dry.
- I think I should go.

354
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,220
oh, no, no, no, no! No.

355
00:18:54,230 --> 00:19:00,740
No one's going anywhe , not till this skinny
little porno ho tells me what he meant just now.

356
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,420
Charlie?

357
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,630
Okay, you know what? All right, fine.

358
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:09,100
I'm sorry, marcy, you know, but after all the shit
we've been through, you know, pretending is pointless.

359
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,000
This is too much fucking work.

360
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,490
You know, it's too much
mess, too much craziness.

361
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,680
I want to get a divorce.
I'm gonna be with daisy.

362
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,360
There. I said it out
loud, can't take it back.

363
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,050
You fucked my man.

364
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,700
Marcy, I
-- marcy --

365
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,590
- Ah, you bitch!
- Did you see that?

366
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,760
You fucking whore!

367
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,880
What are you doing, moody?

368
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,290
You can't stop a girl fight.

369
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,820
- You might accidentally hit one of them.
- Asshole.

370
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,600
You just had to go there, didn't you?

371
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,630
No, go ahead. You do the honors.

372
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,130
What we have here is a
failure to communicate.

373
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,130
Errol flynn used to
swing from that thing.

374
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,860
What, no props for saving your life?

375
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,290
Come on.

376
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,500
Hey, lew. Great party.

377
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,070
You taking off? The night is young.

378
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,110
We'll talk.

379
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,830
Bye, annika... staley.

380
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,100
I used to know that girl.
What'd you do to her?

381
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,940
I don't want to go into the exact details, but I
did solve that, uh, little problem you were having.

382
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,920
You solved it just like that?

383
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,560
Yes, I did.

384
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,460
I told annika that I was the sexy
older man that mia's been banging --

385
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,910
you know, the one from the book.

386
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,180
Yeah, but you haven't
even read the book.

387
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:02,320
That's what you take me for,
right, like a functional illiterate?

388
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,740
I read the little fucker
-- not your best work.

389
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,930
Not my best work?

390
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,460
Girls talk a lot after sex. I
mean, don't get down on yourself.

391
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,070
You hadn't written one for a while.

392
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,220
I'm sure the next one's
gonna be a lot better.

393
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,490
You have to squeeze one out of the
chamber, let the good stuff come through.

394
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,100
Well, thank you, and... for the other.

395
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,270
Whatever, you know?

396
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,540
No offense, but I'm a much bigger story.

397
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:33,970
"Crazy record producer lives alone in big, empty house
with a taste for underage women" -- writes itself.

398
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,580
- It's not the real story, though.
- It's a story.

399
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,880
It's a version of the truth
-- the extended dance mix.

400
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,460
So, problem solved.

401
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:46,940
Marcy's gonna come back with us, and I'm
gonna put all the alcohol under lock and key.

402
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,110
Oh, that's --
that's good.

403
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,920
Oh, no, I have a
bottle stashed --

404
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:55,330
I know where all your
bottles are stashed. Yeah.

405
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,750
Damn it.

406
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,360
So, lew, it was a
truly disastrous party.

407
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,160
- It was, wasn't it? Thank you.
- Thank you.

408
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,230
- But you know what? I underestimated you.
- Me?

409
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:11,640
In the heat of battle, you
shone through, your true colors.

410
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,240
High praise.

411
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,650
I better leave on that
note. Thanks for coming.

412
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,110
Thanks for having me.

413
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:25,040
See you.

414
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,910
What was that all about?

415
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,580
I'll never tell.

416
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,120
More secrets, huh?

417
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,320
I know. Well, you know,
it's such an effort.

418
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:36,120
I have to retain my aura of mystery.

419
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,680
It's no effort.

420
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,880
- Good night.
- Good night.

421
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,880
- Thought I'd be fashionably late.
- You came.

422
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,840
- I was invited, right? - Yes, but
I-I never thought you'd actually show.

423
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,710
Just wait right here.
Lew's, like, three feet away.

424
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,150
No, no, no. Wait a minute. Lew?

425
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,880
Yeah, lew.

426
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,020
And what if I didn't come to see lew?

427
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,200
Then you're not making any sense, woman.

428
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:19,880
I can't lie, hank moody. I think
you stirred something up in me.

429
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,180
Memories -- misty, watercolored
ones. Look around, lady.

430
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:27,370
All this is for you -- all of it -- the
crazy fucking house, the party, everything.

431
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,330
- Really?
- Yeah.

432
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,660
I already have a house.

433
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,170
It's a totally soulless
one. This is a real house.

434
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:38,490
It's old and broken and battered
'cause shit happens here -- real shit.

435
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,780
Yeah. Looks like some
real shit happened here.

436
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:44,940
Ah, ignore that. Things fall
apart. They break. That's life.

437
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:49,060
Oh, I see. So, life has to
be sad and broken, haunted?

438
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,450
Yes.

439
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,540
I don't buy it.

440
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,090
This place looks awful.

441
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,320
It looks like somebody died here.

442
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:00,060
Somebody almost did, but not
tonight. Just wait here. Stay put.

443
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:03,340
Hey, lew! Lew!

444
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:12,390
Oh, yeah. I forgot about that.

445
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,460
yes?

446
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:24,720
out. Everybody out,
please. Please. Thank you.

447
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,830
Wait. What the fuck are you
doing? Don't go. Don't go.

448
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,130
- What the f--
- she's here.

449
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,760
- She who?
- "She who"? Janie, you asshole.

450
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,690
She came.

451
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,720
- No way.
- Yes way.

452
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,710
Get your ass downstairs right now.

453
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,400
No. I mean, ay w. No fucking
way I'm going down there.

454
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:42,200
Did you not hear me?

455
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,160
You -- you go
talk to her.

456
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,620
You want me to talk to her?
What is this, fifth grade?

457
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:52,260
Look, I can't, I mean, not after all this
time, after all the shit that I pulled.

458
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:55,290
I-I don't know. According to
her, you're not such a bad boy.

459
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,060
I mean, you know, you love music a
little too much, blah, blah, blah.

460
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:02,420
She said that shit? I mean,
maybe she really does love me.

461
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,080
Why?

462
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:07,480
Because it's a big fucking lie because
I did all kinds of bad shit to her.

463
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,370
I-I fucked around constantly.
I crashed a car into her house.

464
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,610
I, you know, shit -- once I
even... made her get an abortion.

465
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,850
You made her?

466
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,080
Well, it's not like I
did it myself or anything.

467
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,440
- It's just...
- what?

468
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:26,780
I was kind of fucking this
other girl at the same time.

469
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,040
- While she was pregnant?
- Sure.

470
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,240
Only you didn't know that.

471
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,680
No, I knew. I
just -- I was...

472
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,970
scared shitless, s.

473
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,910
- kind of like you are right now?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

474
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,430
Sit down, ratso rizzo,
you're making me nervous.

475
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,830
Come on. Have a seat.

476
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,810
I'm only gonna say this once, so
I want you to listen, all right?

477
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:51,830
No matter what you did,
don't give up. Do not give up.

478
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,050
Why

479
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,150
because if she loves
you, she'll forgive you.

480
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,320
You really believe that?

481
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:02,300
I have to. Otherwise there's no point.

482
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:07,610
There is no life without love
-- none worth having, anyway.

483
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,830
Fuck it. You're right.

484
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,140
All right. I'm gonna do
this. It's gonna suck.

485
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,980
How do I look?

486
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,920
- Like a big douche bag...
- thank you.

487
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:24,220
A very, very sexy douche bag.

488
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,710
- Just let me grab my jacket.
- All right.

489
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,130
- Fix my hair.
- There you go.

490
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,320
- You got it.
