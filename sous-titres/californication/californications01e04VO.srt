1
00:00:01,173 --> 00:00:02,542
- Father?
- Daughter?

2
00:00:02,924 --> 00:00:05,048
Why is there a naked lady
in your bedroom?

3
00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:07,000
What are you
talking about, revenge?

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,703
Don't make it like it wasn't
the least bit satisfying

5
00:00:09,883 --> 00:00:11,792
to fuck the wife of the man
who turned your

6
00:00:11,998 --> 00:00:14,175
"precious little book"
into a big, shitty movie.

7
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:16,611
Sick of you talking shit
about me in the press.

8
00:00:16,798 --> 00:00:20,641
I thought you came because
you found out I fucked your wife.

9
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:21,942
Asshole.

10
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:24,908
Charlie Runkel's office.

11
00:00:25,197 --> 00:00:28,308
Your assistant makes me want to
touch myself in a bad place.

12
00:00:28,744 --> 00:00:32,008
But from now on, if I make a mistake
or I screw something up,

13
00:00:32,606 --> 00:00:35,737
you should feel free to discipline me
in whatever way you see fit.

14
00:00:38,407 --> 00:00:40,808
- Hi. Remember me?
- How could I forget?

15
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:44,008
- Best blind date of my life, asshole.
- Let me make it up to you.

16
00:00:44,148 --> 00:00:46,377
Can I take you out sometime?

17
00:00:48,357 --> 00:00:50,708
The guy you saw me with
last night is married.

18
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,923
Fucking a married a guy for 5 years?

19
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:55,875
Call him whatever you want.
He can stay with me.

20
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:58,774
Once upon a time, I used to love you.

21
00:00:59,064 --> 00:01:02,168
And no matter what, you will
always be a part of my life.

22
00:01:02,525 --> 00:01:04,627
But I'm not in love with you anymore.

23
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:09,798
Subtitles: swsub.com

24
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:14,442
Yusef, what's a five-letter word
for "excitable boy"?

25
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:15,582
Zevon.

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,185
Booyah.

27
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,404
That's a smart dog.

28
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:26,881
So...

29
00:01:27,081 --> 00:01:29,442
- last night.
- What about it?

30
00:01:29,582 --> 00:01:31,875
I don't want to be hyperbolic
or anything,

31
00:01:32,015 --> 00:01:34,875
but I think we took things
to a whole other level.

32
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:38,008
And why do you feel the need
to relive it the next morning?

33
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:40,841
That's half the fun.
You know, it's like...

34
00:01:41,529 --> 00:01:43,242
getting to do it all over again.

35
00:01:43,802 --> 00:01:47,098
Except without the after-sex sadness

36
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:50,706
that comes down upon one.

37
00:01:56,115 --> 00:01:57,808
Hank, I think we need to talk.

38
00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,846
Talk, really?

39
00:02:00,057 --> 00:02:03,635
Has anything good ever come
of such a thing ever?

40
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:07,371
We've been spending
a lot of time in the bedroom,

41
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:09,304
which is nice, very nice.

42
00:02:10,602 --> 00:02:13,693
But I'm also just coming out of this
horribly dysfunctional relationship

43
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,758
that only existed in the bedroom...

44
00:02:15,986 --> 00:02:17,962
You want me to do you in the shower.

45
00:02:18,935 --> 00:02:19,935
I get it.

46
00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:22,808
You want to go out on the town
with some Hank on your arm.

47
00:02:23,418 --> 00:02:25,653
You want to stroll around
with some of this.

48
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:29,972
That's totally understandable.
We can do it. We can go out. Anything.

49
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:32,475
Anything you want to do.
We'll do it. Just name it.

50
00:02:32,615 --> 00:02:34,008
Let's go. Right now.

51
00:02:34,326 --> 00:02:37,282
- Okay, there's this fund-raiser.
- No, can't do that.

52
00:02:37,515 --> 00:02:40,586
That sounds excruciating.
I won't do that.

53
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,564
It's your agency. You must be invited.

54
00:02:42,736 --> 00:02:44,910
And I'm sure it went
right in the circular file.

55
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,941
Come on, it'll be fun.

56
00:02:47,237 --> 00:02:48,708
It's for a good cause.

57
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:52,941
Well, I'm not much one for causes,
good or otherwise.

58
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:54,543
I'm not a joiner.

59
00:02:54,683 --> 00:02:57,415
- Apathy kills, Hank.
- I don't care.

60
00:03:05,273 --> 00:03:06,974
Does that feel like apathy to you?

61
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,568
You look...

62
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:17,542
half, you know, halfway decent.

63
00:04:17,846 --> 00:04:19,095
Thanks.

64
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,014
How's Becca?

65
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,791
- Well, she's a little bummed.
- Well, that's understandable,

66
00:04:26,969 --> 00:04:29,561
- but this thing came up.
- I know, but she's just...

67
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:33,764
- Dad.
- Beautiful daughter.

68
00:04:37,322 --> 00:04:40,975
- Gee, I don't know where that...
- A bribe?

69
00:04:41,456 --> 00:04:45,242
No, I like to think of it more as
a token of my paternal affection.

70
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:49,857
Are you serious?

71
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:51,986
This is awesome!

72
00:04:52,428 --> 00:04:56,142
Just when I thought we'd agreed
not to get her a cell phone.

73
00:04:56,284 --> 00:04:59,405
I thought we decided that, too,
but then I realized she can call me

74
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:01,776
whenever she's pissed
at you and lurch, so...

75
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:04,503
... changed my mind.

76
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:07,664
Do you have a date?

77
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,466
- I do.
- Do you like her?

78
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:13,941
- She is pretty cool.
- As cool as mom?

79
00:05:14,574 --> 00:05:17,479
Sadly, I have come to find
that that is not possible.

80
00:05:17,723 --> 00:05:21,008
Well, if it's a date
and not just a random hookup,

81
00:05:21,772 --> 00:05:23,883
- I guess I approve.
- Yes!

82
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,247
But I wanna hear
all about her tomorrow.

83
00:05:26,407 --> 00:05:27,812
Absolutely.

84
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:30,467
Call me.

85
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:34,356
I can't believe you.

86
00:05:35,379 --> 00:05:36,581
So...

87
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:39,145
Stop it. The date.

88
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:41,401
- Are you in love?
- Shut up.

89
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:44,173
Where are you taking her?
Red Lobster? Denny's?

90
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:47,208
I wish. I got this fucking fund-raiser
at the agency

91
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,209
I got roped into going to.

92
00:05:57,355 --> 00:05:59,908
Fascist architecture.
Can I ask you a question?

93
00:06:00,048 --> 00:06:02,875
- Go for it.
- What are we doing here?

94
00:06:03,015 --> 00:06:06,234
- Mixing and mingling.
- That's what I thought.

95
00:06:06,394 --> 00:06:10,031
That explains why my sphincter
tightened up a couple notches.

96
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,542
Relax.

97
00:06:13,265 --> 00:06:14,448
There's your agent.

98
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:27,774
- What the fuck?
- What's the problem?

99
00:06:27,914 --> 00:06:29,885
You know how much I hate
that motherfucker.

100
00:06:30,145 --> 00:06:33,875
Yes, I know how much you hate
that A-list, in-demand motherfucker.

101
00:06:34,377 --> 00:06:36,542
But I've been trying
to sign him for years.

102
00:06:36,901 --> 00:06:38,841
Don't make me
fire your ass all over again.

103
00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:42,378
Hank, if I depended on you and
you alone for my commissions,

104
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:45,927
Marcy and I would be sharing a TV dinner
under a bare light bulb right now.

105
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,674
OK but don't do it in front of me.

106
00:06:47,814 --> 00:06:50,283
It's like watching you
cheat on me with another man.

107
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:54,108
You give much better head.
Always have, always will.

108
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,597
I am impressed.

109
00:06:55,762 --> 00:06:58,345
I can't believe you managed
to drag this nonpartisan asshole

110
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:01,852
- out of the house for this shindig.
- I had to use all of my feminine wiles.

111
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,121
And a butt plug.

112
00:07:03,961 --> 00:07:06,697
Speaking of which... where's Marcy?

113
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:09,119
Emergency waxing session.

114
00:07:09,358 --> 00:07:13,208
As we speak, she's likely staring into
the business end of Angelina’s vagina.

115
00:07:14,381 --> 00:07:17,875
Let's take a time-out while I meditate
on that for a few moments.

116
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,482
You do that.
I see a friend. You come find me.

117
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:25,215
I'm sorry. did you say something?

118
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,741
I told you, man. You just needed
to meet a nice girl.

119
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:33,108
- She's not so nice.
- Naughty?

120
00:07:33,774 --> 00:07:35,278
Do I ask you about Marcy's

121
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:39,175
- sexual proclivities?
- Yes, all the time. It's odd, actually.

122
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:43,253
So, what are we talking about here?
A little "S&M"? A little light "B&D"?

123
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:45,371
Slow down, tiger.

124
00:07:47,105 --> 00:07:49,682
Morticia. Call me Hank, please.

125
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:55,602
- So, do you still need me?
- Did you finish reading the manuscript?

126
00:07:56,426 --> 00:07:59,008
- Did you write your coverage on it yet?
- No, not yet.

127
00:07:59,148 --> 00:08:01,774
Then, I think you just answered
your own question.

128
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,997
- Back to work.
- Yes, sir.

129
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:11,862
Anything you want to tell me
about there, captain?

130
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:14,673
Please. I'm a married man.

131
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:20,282
Anything you want to tell me
about there, captain?

132
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:30,609
Can we agree not to throw down
while we have our cocks out?

133
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,982
Really? Yours is out?

134
00:08:35,802 --> 00:08:37,671
- Fag.
- I'm done fighting you, Moody.

135
00:08:37,973 --> 00:08:41,641
This from a man who had a six-pack of
whoop-ass opened up on him last week.

136
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:44,691
I couldn't hurt you if I wanted to.
You're your own worst enemy.

137
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:49,456
That is a very astute observation
coming from a dumb guy.

138
00:08:50,077 --> 00:08:51,641
Did me a big favor, actually.

139
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:54,681
Got me out of a horrible
fucking marriage.

140
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,633
You and Sandy splitting the sheets?
Do tell.

141
00:08:57,927 --> 00:09:00,953
That bitch is crazy. Last time I ever
marry a fucking white woman.

142
00:09:01,093 --> 00:09:02,381
I'm with you there.

143
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,822
- Well, how'd she take it?
- Haven't told her.

144
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,802
- Thinking about doing it tonight.
- Here? she's here?

145
00:09:07,942 --> 00:09:09,025
That's right.

146
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:28,594
There she is.
The former Mrs. Moody.

147
00:09:28,905 --> 00:09:30,604
I was never officially a Moody.

148
00:09:31,075 --> 00:09:33,091
You were moody.
You just weren't a Moody.

149
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:36,179
You could've made me less moody
if you'd made me into a Moody.

150
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,766
- I'll make you a Moody right now.
- It's too late.

151
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:41,279
- It's 4 hours to Vegas.
- No, it's too late.

152
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:45,562
We'll stop in Barstow, in-n-out burgers,
shakes, fries, celebratory coupling,

153
00:09:45,857 --> 00:09:48,551
which I believe is part
of our sordid sexual history.

154
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:51,623
You know, it's very tempting,
but I'm gonna have to say no.

155
00:09:51,888 --> 00:09:53,543
But thank you. Over.

156
00:09:54,152 --> 00:09:56,904
Could you be
on your best behavior tonight?

157
00:09:57,185 --> 00:09:58,260
Please, please.

158
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,842
Like a child you talk to me.
What do you think I'll do?

159
00:10:00,982 --> 00:10:03,469
- You are a child.
- Stir the punch with my dong?

160
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:04,935
Quite possibly, yes.

161
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:07,634
And that's the thing with you, Hank.

162
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:12,070
One never knows what to expect
from you or your dong.

163
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,042
And how is this not a virtue?

164
00:10:17,474 --> 00:10:20,148
You know, honey,
you do look beautiful tonight.

165
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,890
Well, that's... Thank you.
Thank you.

166
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,026
Stop it! No. You just said
you would behave.

167
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,869
Bill is around the corner.

168
00:10:32,137 --> 00:10:35,198
- Okay, come on. We can be adults.
- It just gets so lonely sometimes.

169
00:10:35,455 --> 00:10:38,948
I need a hug in a moment, the moment
passes, and I'm good. Smell you later.

170
00:10:43,445 --> 00:10:45,830
- You finished yet?
- Putting it together right now.

171
00:10:46,008 --> 00:10:47,558
Bring it to me in my office.

172
00:10:49,446 --> 00:10:51,446
U.T.K. Charlie Runkel's office.

173
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:53,356
It's your wife.

174
00:10:57,296 --> 00:10:58,470
Hey, baby.

175
00:10:59,747 --> 00:11:01,068
Yeah, it's going well.

176
00:11:01,978 --> 00:11:04,438
How about you?
How is Angelina's cookie?

177
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:10,798
Really?

178
00:11:11,652 --> 00:11:14,002
Well, that's one of the benefits
of adoption.

179
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:22,106
You know what?
You're... you're breaking up.

180
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:27,692
Yeah, you're... You're...
I'm losing you, babe.

181
00:11:27,898 --> 00:11:30,499
Okay, got to go.

182
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,729
Tell me what to do.

183
00:11:42,627 --> 00:11:45,011
What if you don't wanna do
what I tell you to do?

184
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:48,157
I think you're missing the point.

185
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:58,508
Thank you.

186
00:12:01,073 --> 00:12:02,519
There you are.

187
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:05,298
Hank Moody,

188
00:12:05,655 --> 00:12:08,880
please say hello to my colleague
Jonathan Mandel

189
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,331
and his lovely wife, Nikki.

190
00:12:11,986 --> 00:12:14,050
- Hank Moody? The writer?
- I used to be.

191
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,440
Now I'm Hank Moody the blogger,
soon to be Hank Moody the bartender.

192
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,286
Meredith turned me on to your blog.

193
00:12:21,597 --> 00:12:24,845
- Highly entertaining, Hank.
- Well, that's what I do. I entertain.

194
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:28,418
I'd be interested to see what you write
about this little shindig.

195
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:31,500
Well, just off the top of my head...

196
00:12:33,304 --> 00:12:36,489
I find interesting to hear these people
ranting and raving about saving

197
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,724
the environment when they'll probably
blow like 10 000 pounds of fuel

198
00:12:39,905 --> 00:12:42,900
on their private jet planes
getting down to Cabo this weekend.

199
00:12:43,088 --> 00:12:44,863
That's right, babs. You heard me.

200
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:46,646
Tell Oprah I said so.

201
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:49,120
Put that in your pipe
and smoke it, ladies.

202
00:12:50,746 --> 00:12:53,879
- Meredith, can I get you another drink?
- Will you excuse us?

203
00:12:57,512 --> 00:13:00,376
- Your writing is so good.
- Well, Thank you.

204
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,516
I'm a bit of a scribbler myself,
you know?

205
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,573
Nikki Man... That Nikki Mandel.

206
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,741
You write all that Hollywood, trophy,

207
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:11,478
- clit-lit stank, don't you?
- That's me.

208
00:13:11,898 --> 00:13:15,540
Masturbation material for the North
of Montana <i>hausfrau</i>.

209
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,567
You had me at masturbation.

210
00:13:17,938 --> 00:13:19,919
- I was hoping so.
- You got me all wet.

211
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:22,574
The trick is coming up
with good story ideas.

212
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:23,850
I would imagine.

213
00:13:23,992 --> 00:13:26,239
I'm always on the lookout
for new material...

214
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:30,489
- if you know what I mean.
- It's hard not to know what you mean,

215
00:13:30,785 --> 00:13:32,899
especially when you're being
so subtle about it.

216
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,723
Doesn't pay to be a wallflower.

217
00:13:34,883 --> 00:13:36,548
You and your husband seem fine.

218
00:13:36,688 --> 00:13:39,167
- What's the deal?
- Looks can be deceiving.

219
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:42,108
Those two have been playing grab-ass
for years now.

220
00:13:45,644 --> 00:13:47,732
"I see," said the blind man.

221
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:51,193
Excuse me a moment.

222
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:54,869
Can I talk to you for a second?

223
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:57,104
- What are you doing?
- What are <i>you</i> doing?

224
00:13:57,244 --> 00:13:59,858
No, what are you doing?
That's married guy. Come on.

225
00:14:00,503 --> 00:14:03,588
- I didn't know he was gonna be here.
- Come on.

226
00:14:04,798 --> 00:14:05,972
Okay, I knew.

227
00:14:06,562 --> 00:14:07,550
I'm sorry.

228
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,346
I don't care. It's still a lie.

229
00:14:09,527 --> 00:14:11,804
Look, you want to create
a fuss with me?

230
00:14:12,064 --> 00:14:13,723
That's fine. I'm listening.

231
00:14:13,985 --> 00:14:16,383
I'm kid chaos.
I'll create some chaos for you.

232
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,823
How?

233
00:14:18,217 --> 00:14:19,297
How?

234
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,159
I want to be a 40-year-old virgin.

235
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:36,606
Why?

236
00:14:37,397 --> 00:14:39,538
Because it seems like,
once you get laid,

237
00:14:39,735 --> 00:14:41,885
your life basically turns to shit.

238
00:14:44,678 --> 00:14:45,973
It's not so bad.

239
00:14:47,093 --> 00:14:48,299
You've had the sex?

240
00:14:49,487 --> 00:14:50,576
Sure.

241
00:14:51,982 --> 00:14:53,231
What's it like?

242
00:14:57,675 --> 00:14:58,851
Good.

243
00:15:01,614 --> 00:15:03,079
Bad.

244
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,525
Weird.

245
00:15:06,397 --> 00:15:07,617
Powerful.

246
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:12,686
I don't know. Look, don't worry about
this stuff. You got plenty of time.

247
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,003
- Watch the hair.
- Sorry.

248
00:15:18,571 --> 00:15:20,261
You Miss your dad, don't you?

249
00:15:25,235 --> 00:15:26,343
I Miss my mom.

250
00:15:28,271 --> 00:15:31,551
For what it's worth,
I know my mom really likes you.

251
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,822
I like her, too.

252
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:37,674
It's just...

253
00:15:38,575 --> 00:15:39,843
not the same, you know?

254
00:15:45,147 --> 00:15:46,433
Do you like Bill?

255
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,158
Sure. He's nice.

256
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,447
But he's not like Hank.

257
00:15:54,851 --> 00:15:56,954
Seriously, you're really lucky.

258
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:11,126
Nice.

259
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,910
- Watch it!
- Well, thank you.

260
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:19,134
Great!

261
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,967
- You could look where you're going.
- And you could be a bit less of a cunt.

262
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,211
- What did you say?
- What did I say? I cunt hear you.

263
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,566
Back it up, lady!

264
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,286
What the hell happened here?

265
00:16:31,437 --> 00:16:34,334
The guy spills his drink on me,
then he called me a cunt.

266
00:16:34,474 --> 00:16:36,576
I didn't say a word!
I bumped into her. My bad.

267
00:16:36,716 --> 00:16:39,442
- You liar! Yes, you did!
- She just freaked out on me.

268
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,366
You should've come and get me.

269
00:16:41,506 --> 00:16:43,915
- I can take care of myself. Thank you.
- Clearly.

270
00:16:44,175 --> 00:16:47,451
Sweetie, this is hardly the time
or the place for a scene.

271
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,374
Can't we all just get along? I'm not
looking to press charges or anything.

272
00:16:52,662 --> 00:16:54,876
- Get off of me.
- He's trying to be decent.

273
00:16:55,022 --> 00:16:56,547
No. He's trying to be a dick.

274
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:59,699
You want me to have him thrown out?
Just say the word and I will.

275
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,374
I don't. I just want to go.

276
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:05,157
Now, look, there's a couple
I want you to meet.

277
00:17:07,785 --> 00:17:09,880
Turns out they bought
that house you re-did.

278
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:13,541
There we go. Turn.

279
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:16,411
Come on, lean forward.

280
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:17,915
Yeah, just like that.

281
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,573
Just like that.

282
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:21,896
Look at you, you dirty,
little animal.

283
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:23,394
- Like this?
- Yes.

284
00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:28,094
I missed.

285
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:31,176
Yes, look at that.

286
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:34,302
- Holy fucknuts!
- Shit!

287
00:17:34,582 --> 00:17:37,884
- What, don't you fucking knock?
- Don't you lock?

288
00:17:40,556 --> 00:17:43,218
Why don't you go grab him
some water or something?

289
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,234
Take it easy there, Diane Arbus.

290
00:17:51,152 --> 00:17:52,614
Don't have a coronary,

291
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,601
'cause I wouldn't know how
to explain that to your wife.

292
00:17:57,165 --> 00:18:00,911
It's all right. Maybe it's time
to punch out there, Bettie Page.

293
00:18:12,682 --> 00:18:13,682
Here.

294
00:18:16,091 --> 00:18:19,242
First things first... You're not gonna
stroke out on me, are you?

295
00:18:20,241 --> 00:18:22,401
Good. You just relax.

296
00:18:23,381 --> 00:18:25,041
It's all good. It was me.

297
00:18:25,182 --> 00:18:27,384
You're lucky it was
me coming in that door, huh?

298
00:18:29,738 --> 00:18:32,900
Look at me, look at me.
Let me see those eyes.

299
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:35,467
Yeah, you're good, you're good.

300
00:18:36,855 --> 00:18:39,150
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck were you thinking

301
00:18:39,308 --> 00:18:41,018
fucking around with your secretary?

302
00:18:41,158 --> 00:18:43,161
"How much of a big fat cliché can I be"?

303
00:18:43,303 --> 00:18:45,109
She started it, man.

304
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,517
Come on.

305
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:50,993
I guess I...

306
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:54,238
- ... got a little carried away.
- You think?

307
00:18:54,579 --> 00:18:57,959
I don't even know what happened, man.
One minute, I am sailing along,

308
00:18:58,198 --> 00:19:01,708
I'm being the guy who would
never, ever cheat on his wife.

309
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:06,829
The next second, I'm spanking the bare,
naked ass of a 22-year-old girl.

310
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:11,747
I'm not gonna be judgmental,
because, a/ Who the fuck am I to talk?

311
00:19:11,928 --> 00:19:14,852
and b/ What you just described
sounds incredibly hot.

312
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,019
But you got to get your shit together.

313
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,275
All right? You owe it to Marcy.

314
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:23,155
I know.
I'm such a fucking asshole, man.

315
00:19:23,552 --> 00:19:25,982
If anybody deserves
to be disciplined, it's me.

316
00:19:26,977 --> 00:19:28,226
It's not an invitation.

317
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,414
If you're having
problems in the boudoir,

318
00:19:34,722 --> 00:19:36,938
it's worth a conversation
with the old lady.

319
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:44,375
I'm afraid that ship
sailed some time ago.

320
00:19:44,868 --> 00:19:46,268
I don't know, you know,

321
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:49,231
Marcy, to me, is nothing
if not a dirty, little girl.

322
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:52,265
I think, with all due respect,

323
00:19:53,348 --> 00:19:55,027
if you talk to her, I think

324
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:58,586
she'd be into some seriously
freaky shit.

325
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,513
Big boy. You're not crying, are you?

326
00:20:10,754 --> 00:20:12,728
- A little bit.
Jesus Christ.

327
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:20,121
- May I have another glass of wine?
- Hey!

328
00:20:20,362 --> 00:20:23,048
Time to hang up
your drinking shoes, lady.

329
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,108
You love me, don't you, Hank?

330
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,542
I've certainly grown very fond of you.

331
00:20:29,682 --> 00:20:31,941
- But I think that's...
- Let me guess.

332
00:20:32,624 --> 00:20:35,911
It's a little early for
this particular discussion.

333
00:20:36,215 --> 00:20:37,855
Something like that, yeah.

334
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:42,208
We'll probably never make it
to this particular discussion.

335
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,197
Why do you say that?

336
00:20:45,371 --> 00:20:49,129
Well, when you've spent
the last five years loving a man

337
00:20:50,571 --> 00:20:52,955
and wondering why
he doesn't love you back...

338
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:57,687
...you tend to get
a wee bit cynical about things.

339
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:03,693
You stay right here...

340
00:21:06,188 --> 00:21:07,944
... and you hydrate.

341
00:21:09,145 --> 00:21:10,506
I'll be right back.

342
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:27,164
What'd you say?

343
00:21:27,338 --> 00:21:29,529
You need a double dose
of Viagra to get wood

344
00:21:29,671 --> 00:21:31,619
and you wear a fanny pack
on the weekends.

345
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,400
- Think you're pretty clever, don't you?
- You wanna fuck around, fine.

346
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:38,572
Fuck around all you want,
I'm no judge Judy.

347
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,933
But don't string a woman along
for a major chunk

348
00:21:41,075 --> 00:21:43,221
of her childbearing years.
That's not cool.

349
00:21:43,381 --> 00:21:46,908
- Who are you? Don Quixote?
- No, I'm not even Don fucking Knotts.

350
00:21:47,354 --> 00:21:50,708
- I'm a big fan of the lady in question.
- That's incredibly noble,

351
00:21:50,848 --> 00:21:53,840
considering how the lady
in question talks about you.

352
00:21:54,234 --> 00:21:55,759
I was curious,

353
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,741
because despite what you say,
I do care about her,

354
00:21:58,983 --> 00:22:02,416
So, I asked, "Who is he? Is this
someone I need to worry about?"

355
00:22:02,785 --> 00:22:04,144
You know what she said?

356
00:22:04,326 --> 00:22:07,761
"Him? He's nobody, a loser,

357
00:22:09,054 --> 00:22:12,609
"someone to pass the time with
when I'm not in bed with you."

358
00:22:13,955 --> 00:22:17,081
So, maybe you're the one who
needs to be cut loose, pal.

359
00:22:19,018 --> 00:22:22,672
- You're very lucky, my friend.
- And why is that?

360
00:22:22,937 --> 00:22:25,604
'Cause I promised someone
I'd be on my best behavior.

361
00:22:25,872 --> 00:22:27,162
Fucking fucker!

362
00:22:28,852 --> 00:22:31,001
- My God!
- What are you doing?

363
00:22:31,148 --> 00:22:32,803
I'm glad we came.

364
00:22:34,406 --> 00:22:35,542
That was fun.

365
00:22:36,324 --> 00:22:37,845
You're funny.

366
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:41,686
There you go. You're good, you're good.

367
00:22:47,377 --> 00:22:50,362
- Proud of me?
- Almost never, but,

368
00:22:50,563 --> 00:22:52,075
yeah, I approve.

369
00:22:52,295 --> 00:22:55,997
No, no.
My behavior... me and my dong.

370
00:22:56,258 --> 00:22:58,606
- Well-behaved.
- Right... good.

371
00:22:58,806 --> 00:23:00,970
- Did nothing.
- Congratulations.

372
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,941
You are proud of me.
Did you have a good night?

373
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:05,677
Yeah, I did.

374
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,908
For a radical environmentalist
such as yourself,

375
00:23:09,048 --> 00:23:12,075
this whole evening must have
given you a clit-boner.

376
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:13,884
You're disgusting.

377
00:23:14,483 --> 00:23:15,904
See you next Tuesday!

378
00:23:17,037 --> 00:23:18,069
Fuck you!

379
00:23:20,129 --> 00:23:21,972
What is that? What are you doing?

380
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:25,201
He's just a classy guy.
He called me a cunt.

381
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:28,944
- This guy called you a cunt?
- I dealt with it. I dealt with it.

382
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,824
It's okay, I just want to...

383
00:23:31,565 --> 00:23:32,767
Excuse me.

384
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:39,211
Good night.

385
00:23:39,927 --> 00:23:41,094
Good night.

386
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:00,333
- Hey.
- Hey, mom.

387
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:03,124
I'm sorry. Go back to sleep.

388
00:24:04,933 --> 00:24:06,572
- Mom?
- Yeah?

389
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:08,956
Can I ask you something?

390
00:24:09,161 --> 00:24:10,967
Anything, my love.

391
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:13,331
Do you love Bill?

392
00:24:16,502 --> 00:24:17,504
Yeah.

393
00:24:18,401 --> 00:24:19,487
Yeah, I do.

394
00:24:20,649 --> 00:24:22,113
Do you love dad?

395
00:24:22,282 --> 00:24:23,396
Yes...

396
00:24:24,437 --> 00:24:26,492
because we have you in common.

397
00:24:27,589 --> 00:24:30,729
I mean... I don't love him

398
00:24:30,889 --> 00:24:33,674
in that butterflies-in-the-tummy
way anymore.

399
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,976
I mean...

400
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:38,323
not in the way that we love
Johnny Depp, definitely not.

401
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:40,771
Right.

402
00:24:42,292 --> 00:24:43,879
Is dad a bad person?

403
00:24:44,478 --> 00:24:45,846
No, not at all.

404
00:24:46,636 --> 00:24:48,158
He does have a habit

405
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,641
of getting himself and
everyone else around him

406
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:52,805
into trouble sometimes, but...

407
00:24:58,209 --> 00:25:00,059
Bill is a good person, sweetie.

408
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:04,407
You know, he's kind, he's smart,

409
00:25:05,647 --> 00:25:07,009
and he really...

410
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,814
He thinks things through.

411
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:14,601
I love you.

412
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:20,457
- Good night.
- Good night.

413
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:31,075
It's been a long time since someone
held my hair back as I puked.

414
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:33,830
It's been an honor and a privilege.

415
00:25:43,868 --> 00:25:45,265
Care to join me?

416
00:25:45,485 --> 00:25:48,271
Whew, still kind of barfy.
Get some sleep.

417
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:52,832
Thank you.

418
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,541
It's what I do.

419
00:26:11,311 --> 00:26:14,008
"B" to the "E" to the "C"
to the "C" to the "A."

420
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,373
<i>- Hi, dad.</i>
- What up, G?

421
00:26:16,955 --> 00:26:19,908
I called because I had
a feeling you couldn't sleep.

422
00:26:20,862 --> 00:26:23,941
Right as usual, my beautiful,
precocious daughter.

423
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:28,107
Remember what you used to do
for me when I couldn't sleep?

424
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,721
<i>Dose you with opiates?</i>.

425
00:26:32,312 --> 00:26:34,896
<i>You'd look at the ocean
and count the mermaids.</i>

426
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:37,497
I did do that.

427
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:40,891
I'm a better father than I thought.

428
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,959
Maybe you should try that,
and it will help.

429
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,281
Yeah.

430
00:26:53,385 --> 00:26:54,386
<i>One...</i>

431
00:26:57,646 --> 00:26:58,648
Two...

432
00:26:59,554 --> 00:27:02,028
Three... no, that's a sea lion.

433
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:05,081
<i>Four...</i>

434
00:27:07,172 --> 00:27:08,134
Five...

435
00:27:09,135 --> 00:27:11,239
Six... no, that's a bum.

436
00:27:13,689 --> 00:27:14,715
<i>Seven...</i>

437
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:17,294
Eight...

438
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,074
Nine... no, that's Daryl Hannah.

439
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,872
<i>Ten...</i>

440
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:29,541
Eleven...
