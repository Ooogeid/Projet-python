1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,293
Previously on Californication...

2
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:04,508
- My name is Hank.
- I know.

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,319
This is Mia, Bill's daughter,
and this is Hank.

4
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:12,397
You two know each other?

5
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:13,997
She's 16.

6
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:17,664
It's not a memoir.

7
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:20,186
It's a written account
of my sexual relationship with you.

8
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,146
Written by me as a fucking novel.

9
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:24,774
Even I'm confused,
and I stole the damn thing.

10
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,090
Didn't you get the memo?

11
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:28,975
I'm taking <i>Fucking & punching</i>
all over this fair country of ours...

12
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,113
Coming soon
to a super-sized bookstore near you.

13
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,349
They came...
The divorce papers.

14
00:00:33,474 --> 00:00:36,327
I have said all along
I still love you.

15
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,270
Fuck your pussy.

16
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,623
My back!

17
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:41,916
You okay?

18
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,751
What the fuck is this?

19
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:44,917
Fucking retarded.

20
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,304
Retarded and sweet...

21
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:49,882
Just like you, Runkle.

22
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,594
I can't believe
you slept with all of them.

23
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,639
Yes, I suppose I did.

24
00:00:56,926 --> 00:00:59,100
So what, you're saying we just
pack up and leave L.A.?

25
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:00,935
The three of us
move back to New York?

26
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,453
Yeah, end of the semester, whatever.

27
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,346
What is it about New York, Hank?

28
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,517
What do you think
you're gonna find there?

29
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,227
Happiness.

30
00:01:43,986 --> 00:01:44,979
I'll be happy...

31
00:01:45,558 --> 00:01:46,558
Finally.

32
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,442
- Are you sure?
- Yes, of course I'm sure.

33
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:51,652
It's what I want.

34
00:01:52,394 --> 00:01:53,357
I love you.

35
00:01:53,482 --> 00:01:56,634
Wherever you go, there you are.

36
00:01:58,775 --> 00:01:59,952
That is true, but...

37
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:02,239
Why do you drink so much?

38
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:04,206
Are you punishing yourself?

39
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:07,418
Do you feel guilty about something?

40
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:12,576
I miss fucking you.

41
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,926
I miss it too,
but I just can't do that anymore.

42
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,261
I don't care anymore.

43
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:19,756
Our best days are behind us now.

44
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:21,348
You're just chasing the dragon.

45
00:02:21,957 --> 00:02:23,934
We're never gonna live
happily ever after.

46
00:02:24,334 --> 00:02:26,384
You're gonna die poor, drunk...

47
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,355
and alone.

48
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,857
I was available, Hank.

49
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,692
Why didn't you love me back?

50
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,402
Well, because I love her.

51
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:36,551
You're my role model, you know,

52
00:02:37,175 --> 00:02:40,076
for men, for relationships.

53
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,245
What hope could I possibly have?

54
00:03:13,174 --> 00:03:14,026
Are you OK?

55
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,820
I'm fine. I'm fine.

56
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:17,279
What up, ladies?

57
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,836
Your daughter has a question
for you.

58
00:03:20,961 --> 00:03:21,961
All right.

59
00:03:22,386 --> 00:03:23,886
Ask away, shortness.

60
00:03:24,156 --> 00:03:27,207
What's that place, again,
with the really good bagels?

61
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:29,668
How soon they forget.

62
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,545
Murray's, the answer is Murray's.

63
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,413
Murray's.
That's right.

64
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:36,674
What about that place,
on the west side,

65
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,842
we go for breakfast sometimes?

66
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,150
- Barney...
- Greengrass. Barney Greengrass,

67
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:43,848
where you may have very well
been conceived, young lady.

68
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,016
Really?

69
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,143
Actually, no, it was
the bathroom at CBGB's.

70
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,180
Boundaries, people.

71
00:03:51,305 --> 00:03:53,482
We went to the bathroom
at Greengrass the next day,

72
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,647
if you recall.

73
00:03:54,772 --> 00:03:58,529
And who's to say
which batch of seed took root, woman?

74
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,682
- This is true.
- And there goes my appetite.

75
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,576
We should maybe go pay
a visit there, to that shrine

76
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:05,746
to your vagin... a.

77
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,414
One of these days I'm going
to start talking openly about sex,

78
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:10,701
and you're not gonna like it.

79
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,127
Can you pass the orange juice?

80
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,295
Of course.

81
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,670
Come on!

82
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,438
This is fun.
I'm gonna miss this.

83
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,107
- I'm gonna miss you, man.
- Me too, vanilla sweetness.

84
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,109
No, I mean,
I'm really gonna miss you.

85
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:39,737
You are my best friend, Hank.

86
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,650
Why don't you just come to New York?

87
00:04:41,775 --> 00:04:44,366
- Really?
- You can be our houseboy, homeboy.

88
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,806
That would be fun, actually, yeah.

89
00:04:47,174 --> 00:04:48,746
I could make you guys breakfast.

90
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,707
I could help Becca get dressed
and ready for school.

91
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,667
She's not a toddler, you fucktard.

92
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:54,985
I don't know.

93
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:57,671
I don't have any kids...
yet.

94
00:04:58,057 --> 00:05:00,039
What, "yet"?
You've had, like, five vasectomies.

95
00:05:00,164 --> 00:05:01,879
Two, buddy boy, two.

96
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:05,012
And, you know, I think maybe
it might be time for a reversal.

97
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,348
I think I might like to make a baby

98
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,183
- with Marcy.
- Interesting.

99
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,783
Has Marcy shown any inclination

100
00:05:11,908 --> 00:05:14,480
that she might want
to make a baby with you?

101
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:18,228
I have reason to believe she might
be open to such a thing. Yes, I do.

102
00:05:18,353 --> 00:05:21,277
Would that be before or after
the divorce papers come through?

103
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,114
You don't know. We've been
getting along like gangbusters lately.

104
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,466
Really, I would say,
if I was a bettin' man,

105
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:28,661
that these two crazy kids
are gonna work it out.

106
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:32,122
Yes, we are back... up high.
Give me five.

107
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,457
Way up, in the air.

108
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:35,042
- Up...
- Too high for me.

109
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:38,353
Honey, I'm home.

110
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:41,501
Look what the cat dragged in.

111
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:48,151
It's...

112
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:51,392
my favorite female novelist.

113
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,038
Doesn't she look beautiful?

114
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,290
She does. Look at you all footlose
and fancy-free and grown up.

115
00:05:57,415 --> 00:06:00,859
Yeah, I'm glad I caught you guys
before you took off for New York.

116
00:06:01,343 --> 00:06:03,551
So, what brings you to...

117
00:06:03,676 --> 00:06:05,072
to these fair parts?

118
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,547
The paperback is coming out,

119
00:06:06,672 --> 00:06:10,452
and we're doing a little signing/reading
in Venice. I want you to come.

120
00:06:10,957 --> 00:06:13,474
God, would that we could,
but we have too much with the packing.

121
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:16,125
It's overwhelming, really,
and we got to set our affairs

122
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,690
in order, so to speak.

123
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:20,930
That's all taken care of.

124
00:06:21,055 --> 00:06:23,299
I said yes already, that we'd go.

125
00:06:24,474 --> 00:06:25,592
Of course you did.

126
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:28,285
And also, Mia wants to

127
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,110
introduce us to someone.

128
00:06:30,688 --> 00:06:33,142
A parole officer, perhaps?

129
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,353
A boyfriend,
and it's serious, right?

130
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,439
Yeah, well, he is pretty great.

131
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:39,580
Is it love?

132
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:40,770
Well, what does...

133
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,229
What does she know of love?

134
00:06:42,354 --> 00:06:44,653
She's far too young
to speak on such matters.

135
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,421
Too young?
Hank, didn't you get the memo?

136
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:49,450
I'm totally legal now.

137
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:53,437
Good to know. This is gonna be
just way too much fun.

138
00:06:53,737 --> 00:06:56,498
Are you sure you don't want me
to stay home and watch Becca? Because...

139
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,834
- What is wrong with you?
- I don't deserve so much fun.

140
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,544
That's probably Becca right now.

141
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:01,786
We're coming.

142
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,590
Hey, sweetie, guess...

143
00:07:10,588 --> 00:07:13,658
Well, as much as I'd love
to stay and watch you squirm,

144
00:07:13,783 --> 00:07:15,909
I got to get moving.
But I'll see you tonight, right?

145
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:19,192
- I'm looking forward to it.
- So am I... So much so.

146
00:07:19,317 --> 00:07:23,150
And just so you know, after all this
time, you still make me a little wet.

147
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,366
I'm shuttering the agency.

148
00:07:31,891 --> 00:07:34,036
What?
Why?

149
00:07:35,551 --> 00:07:38,660
Yeah, it's time this old broad
hung up her dancing shoes,

150
00:07:39,768 --> 00:07:41,210
time I kicked back,

151
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,378
relaxed,

152
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:45,756
spent a little quality time
with my dickie.

153
00:07:46,213 --> 00:07:49,635
So many positions left to explore.

154
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,429
And...

155
00:07:53,494 --> 00:07:55,015
I have to work on this.

156
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,813
What am be dat?

157
00:07:57,832 --> 00:07:58,769
My memoir.

158
00:08:02,705 --> 00:08:04,921
I would love to read it sometime.

159
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,115
I want you to read it.

160
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,072
And then I want you to sell it.

161
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:13,247
That's right, Runkle.
I want you to be my agent.

162
00:08:13,372 --> 00:08:16,005
What are you talking about, Sue?
You fired me.

163
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:20,040
Look, Runkle, whether you know it
or not, you're a maverick, a renegade.

164
00:08:20,402 --> 00:08:23,544
You beat off to the march
of your own drummer.

165
00:08:24,248 --> 00:08:25,671
That's the kind of agent I want.

166
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,090
That's the kind of agent
I've always tried to be.

167
00:08:31,148 --> 00:08:32,866
And in the meantime,

168
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:35,213
you can take me.

169
00:08:37,462 --> 00:08:39,572
Okay, I see where this is going.

170
00:08:39,697 --> 00:08:41,436
You're dangling your memoirs...

171
00:08:41,561 --> 00:08:43,938
Which I know I can sell
the shit out of, by the way...

172
00:08:44,063 --> 00:08:47,113
As an excuse to continue
our torrid little affair.

173
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:52,743
I don't see why the two
cannot peacefully coexist.

174
00:08:52,868 --> 00:08:54,575
Because I love my wife, Sue.

175
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,369
We're on a serious upswing now.

176
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,414
And I am sick and tired of your
constant sexual harassment.

177
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:05,127
You say harassment. I say a couple of
big, juicy orgasms between friends.

178
00:09:05,896 --> 00:09:07,754
All right, we'll have it your way...

179
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,622
Completely professional.

180
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,167
- Thank you, Sue.
- Utterly boring.

181
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:17,761
Collini...

182
00:09:19,682 --> 00:09:20,682
Wet.

183
00:09:27,896 --> 00:09:30,945
Love the writing...
So visceral and real.

184
00:09:31,473 --> 00:09:33,530
Who are some of your influences?

185
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,291
God...
there are so many.

186
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:42,080
But if I had to narrow it down,
I guess I'd have to say Bukowski...

187
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,707
Nabokov.

188
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:48,837
But I guess the writer
who really shaped me,

189
00:09:49,107 --> 00:09:50,839
the one
who was my last true influence

190
00:09:50,964 --> 00:09:53,258
before I started
doing this professionally,

191
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,594
that would have to be Hank Moody.

192
00:09:59,376 --> 00:10:00,376
Thank you.

193
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,660
You're so Moody.

194
00:10:06,785 --> 00:10:08,970
You must be Hank and Karen.

195
00:10:10,499 --> 00:10:12,194
Paul Ryder, Mia's manager.

196
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,990
Mia's got a manager now.
What is this world coming to?

197
00:10:18,404 --> 00:10:21,286
Oh, you'd be surprised.
Careers need guidance, nurturing.

198
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,162
- Sure.
- You hear that? Nurturing.

199
00:10:23,287 --> 00:10:25,749
I suppose,
if you're into that sort of thing.

200
00:10:27,972 --> 00:10:30,337
I wanted to tell you,
I'm a really big fan.

201
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:35,801
Anyway, Mia wanted me to invite you guys
back to the house for a drink.

202
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,412
You will.
You will see us later.

203
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:45,771
- What's wrong with you, woman?
- He's a big fan of yours, okay?

204
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,396
It'll all be about you.

205
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:53,769
Do you want to bone?

206
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:57,993
Do I want to bone?

207
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,310
Does the pope shit in the Vatican?

208
00:11:00,435 --> 00:11:01,451
In the woods.

209
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,371
- What?
- Does the pope shit in the woods?

210
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,330
- That's the joke.
- I know.

211
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:07,666
I modified it.
That's what funny people do.

212
00:11:09,271 --> 00:11:10,794
Whatever, dude.

213
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:14,756
You know, I have been thinking
about getting a reversal...

214
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,560
Of my vasectomy.

215
00:11:20,643 --> 00:11:22,264
- Why?
- Why?

216
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,975
In case I want to have kids one day.

217
00:11:25,597 --> 00:11:27,602
Do you think that's a good idea?

218
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:31,081
I think...

219
00:11:32,453 --> 00:11:34,953
- Shut up and fuck me.
- I can do that.

220
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,334
Party people everywhere,
raise the roof.

221
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,204
- I'm so glad you could make it.
- You were great.

222
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,358
Did you meet Paul?

223
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:53,987
Where's the fella?

224
00:11:55,537 --> 00:11:56,937
This is my fellow.

225
00:11:59,949 --> 00:12:01,637
Your boyfriend is your manager?

226
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,520
Is there going to ba a movie?

227
00:12:11,412 --> 00:12:13,982
It sure looks like it.
We're talking to Evan Rachel Wood.

228
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,902
- That's awesome. She would be great.
- Rachel who?

229
00:12:17,727 --> 00:12:19,488
The script's out
to directors right now.

230
00:12:20,249 --> 00:12:21,490
Did you write the script?

231
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,098
Screenwriting's not my thing...

232
00:12:25,223 --> 00:12:27,663
Too many rules.
I'll stick to fiction.

233
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,290
That's a good call.
You stick to fiction.

234
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:36,171
I think Evan might be around here.
Do you want to meet her?

235
00:12:36,963 --> 00:12:38,006
I'll introduce you.

236
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,881
- Yeah, me too.
- Who?

237
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:41,089
Honey...

238
00:12:41,214 --> 00:12:42,636
OK, but I would like a kiss.

239
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:44,422
Kiss me.

240
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:57,993
- Working on anything?
- God, no.

241
00:12:58,118 --> 00:13:00,682
Just mostly my tan.
I'm trying to get that all-over deal.

242
00:13:00,807 --> 00:13:02,864
It's hard to get the taint
nice and golden, though.

243
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,333
I imagine so.

244
00:13:05,897 --> 00:13:09,454
It's been a while, though,
since you had something out there?

245
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:12,417
Don't worry about me, buddy boy.

246
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:14,167
Worry about Mia.

247
00:13:14,802 --> 00:13:16,352
I do worry about her.

248
00:13:17,335 --> 00:13:20,173
She's having some trouble
with her second book.

249
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:22,342
I'm not surprised.

250
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:23,969
Why?

251
00:13:26,696 --> 00:13:28,635
It's just that writing's hard,
you know.

252
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,726
Writing's fucking hard,
wunderkind or not.

253
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,436
Fuck, yeah, it's hard.

254
00:13:33,504 --> 00:13:35,031
That's funny, because I thought

255
00:13:35,156 --> 00:13:37,654
you were meaning it
because she didn't write

256
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:39,818
<i>Fucking & Punching</i>
in the first place.

257
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,701
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's between you and your client.

258
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:53,481
Her publisher asked her to write

259
00:13:53,606 --> 00:13:55,876
some extra pages for the paperback.

260
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:58,739
She told me she couldn't...
Too stressed.

261
00:13:58,864 --> 00:14:01,882
So I took care of it,
managed expectations,

262
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,396
told them the road
was taking its toll.

263
00:14:04,521 --> 00:14:06,553
They bought it.
No big deal.

264
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:09,234
I had a feeling...

265
00:14:10,195 --> 00:14:13,149
So I kept pressing her
to show me some more pages.

266
00:14:13,274 --> 00:14:15,824
She finally did,
and they were rambling,

267
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,234
incoherent, pretentious.

268
00:14:19,187 --> 00:14:21,276
Not the same voice
behind <i>Fucking & Punching</i>...

269
00:14:22,514 --> 00:14:24,794
Not even close, night and day.

270
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:27,494
I start asking questions.

271
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:29,935
Didn't take long.

272
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,020
She broke down, told me everything.

273
00:14:38,906 --> 00:14:39,956
Everything?

274
00:14:41,684 --> 00:14:43,423
Quite the literary scandal
we have here...

275
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:48,567
Which is not a bad thing,
necessarily.

276
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,181
What the fuck
is that suppose to mean?

277
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:54,068
Think about it, Hank?

278
00:14:55,156 --> 00:14:56,806
What if she came clean?

279
00:14:57,699 --> 00:14:59,648
Told the story behind the story.

280
00:14:59,981 --> 00:15:02,484
Her fame suddenly becomes
something else,

281
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:05,017
entirely, something I can work with.

282
00:15:05,142 --> 00:15:07,822
Who knows? Maybe she goes on Oprah,
a fucking reality show...

283
00:15:07,947 --> 00:15:09,825
I don't know.
I'm just spitballing here.

284
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,548
But it's better than fading away,
and best of all,

285
00:15:12,673 --> 00:15:13,995
you get your book back...

286
00:15:14,283 --> 00:15:15,669
Maybe some infamy of your own.

287
00:15:15,794 --> 00:15:19,394
The publishing world knows you
as this brilliant train wreck.

288
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,169
Let everyone else in on it.

289
00:15:22,229 --> 00:15:24,918
I can get you
a tell-all deal like that.

290
00:15:26,835 --> 00:15:28,885
You think this shit is funny?

291
00:15:32,238 --> 00:15:35,888
I think it's a fucking disaster.
My biggest client is a fraud.

292
00:15:36,187 --> 00:15:37,769
I'm trying to make the best.

293
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,772
Fuck you. You're trying
to capitalize on a bad situation.

294
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:42,584
I know that you're all pissed off

295
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,975
at the world right now,
and you want to take it out on me.

296
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,904
But just remember, I'm not the one
that fucked an underage girl.

297
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,822
I waited till she was 18.

298
00:15:53,627 --> 00:15:55,241
Are you boys getting along?

299
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,705
Famously.

300
00:15:58,635 --> 00:16:00,834
Hey, sweetie.
Isn't he a genius, Hank?

301
00:16:01,095 --> 00:16:03,303
Oh, please, I'm a mere businessman.

302
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:05,668
You artists are the real geniuses.

303
00:16:05,793 --> 00:16:06,793
To Mia...

304
00:16:08,223 --> 00:16:10,385
And to her greatest influence.

305
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:29,050
Yes, you certainly could be
in a lot of trouble.

306
00:16:30,517 --> 00:16:32,908
- But I didn't know.
- Doesn't matter.

307
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,576
It's your word
against hers, and sorry,

308
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:37,871
but no one believes a word
out of your mouth.

309
00:16:38,441 --> 00:16:40,081
I thought I was charming.

310
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,791
Not that charming.

311
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:58,584
Come on.

312
00:17:09,168 --> 00:17:10,168
Don't go.

313
00:17:10,469 --> 00:17:12,322
Don't leave. Stay with us.

314
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:48,781
I think she's talking about Rexy.

315
00:17:48,906 --> 00:17:51,739
Isn't that where she's like,
"he's just so stupid"?

316
00:17:57,114 --> 00:17:58,264
Are you okay?

317
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,650
Yeah, I'm good.
I just...

318
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,575
I didn't sleep very well last night.

319
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:06,983
Why don't you...

320
00:18:07,108 --> 00:18:09,629
Why don't you take this sourpuss
out for a walk

321
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,798
or something.

322
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,175
I've got so much packing to do.

323
00:18:13,737 --> 00:18:14,843
I'm so excited!

324
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:35,796
You know what I'm going to miss?

325
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:37,761
These walks.

326
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,868
When I think back on L.A.,
that's what I'll remember.

327
00:18:44,572 --> 00:18:46,480
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Did you say something?

328
00:18:46,605 --> 00:18:47,655
Never mind.

329
00:18:50,443 --> 00:18:52,640
There's something
I have to tell you.

330
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:54,569
Dad?

331
00:18:55,478 --> 00:18:57,028
All right, go for it.

332
00:18:57,377 --> 00:18:59,027
I haven't told mom yet.

333
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:02,838
For some reason,
I feel like I need to tell you first.

334
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,146
The other night,
when I slept over at Chelsea's...

335
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:10,475
We snuck out.

336
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:13,610
It's not as bad as it sounds, dad.

337
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:17,692
And wouldn't you rather
I be honest about this stuff?

338
00:19:18,749 --> 00:19:20,191
Yes, of course.

339
00:19:20,881 --> 00:19:21,881
Go ahead.

340
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:26,790
So we were just wandering around campus,
and we met these boys.

341
00:19:28,096 --> 00:19:29,542
Okay, now I'm vaguely nauseous.

342
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,169
Just bear with me, okay?

343
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:35,613
Chelsea immediately hooked up
with the dickish good-looking one

344
00:19:35,738 --> 00:19:37,634
and spent the night
in his dorm room.

345
00:19:38,651 --> 00:19:41,139
I ended up "sexiled"
with the nerd...

346
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:44,057
- The Michael Sara type.
- Michael who?

347
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,450
It doesn't matter.

348
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:48,472
The point is, we ended up walking
and talking all night long.

349
00:19:48,597 --> 00:19:50,605
He was really sweet,
a total gentleman.

350
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:53,566
All right, well,
I like the sound of that.

351
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:58,259
- He did kiss me, though.
- Here comes another wave.

352
00:19:58,384 --> 00:20:01,084
It was nice to have a boy
want to kiss you.

353
00:20:02,417 --> 00:20:04,786
He tried to go further,
but I stopped him.

354
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,473
- That's my girl.
- He was totally sweet about it.

355
00:20:07,598 --> 00:20:09,266
- Okay.
- Very understanding.

356
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:12,418
- Sounds good.
- Heard me out, didn't push it.

357
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,753
That's great.

358
00:20:14,066 --> 00:20:16,316
- But we did it anyway.
- Right...

359
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,033
Wait, what?

360
00:20:18,158 --> 00:20:20,343
What... You did... You did what?

361
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:24,006
Don't be mad at me, okay? I don't know
if I could take that right now.

362
00:20:24,131 --> 00:20:26,308
We used protection.
He had a condom in his wallet

363
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,829
that he said had been there
since high school.

364
00:20:28,954 --> 00:20:31,354
It wasn't love
and it wasn't perfect or anything.

365
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:33,815
But I'm glad I did it.
I got it over with.

366
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,264
And I wanted to tell you first
because I wanted you to know

367
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:38,987
that you didn't fuck me up.

368
00:20:39,593 --> 00:20:42,297
My life is tough and weird
and unpleasant sometimes,

369
00:20:42,422 --> 00:20:45,510
but I walk around knowing
that I have parents who love me,

370
00:20:45,635 --> 00:20:49,539
who care about me, who always try their
best, even if they screw up sometimes.

371
00:20:51,245 --> 00:20:53,860
I know I gave you a hard time
when mom was gone,

372
00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:56,437
but I hope you know
that I love you, dad.

373
00:20:56,562 --> 00:20:57,672
And I always will.

374
00:21:11,384 --> 00:21:12,384
Can you...

375
00:21:13,682 --> 00:21:16,650
Can you wait till New York
to tell your mom about this?

376
00:21:24,025 --> 00:21:25,724
I'm a woman now, dad.

377
00:22:24,806 --> 00:22:26,052
You don't want to do this.

378
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,596
- Do what, Hank?
- Come on, don't fuck with me.

379
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,391
You must have some idea what
he's thinking. Why would you tell him?

380
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,011
Because I'm in love with him.

381
00:22:33,136 --> 00:22:35,469
People in love tell
each other everything.

382
00:22:36,198 --> 00:22:37,848
Maybe not in your case.

383
00:22:40,013 --> 00:22:42,068
You can do better than this guy.
You can.

384
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,285
Oh, yeah?
Who's better, you?

385
00:22:44,637 --> 00:22:46,581
This past year has been
a roller-coaster ride,

386
00:22:46,706 --> 00:22:48,572
and he's been the only one
taking care of me.

387
00:22:48,697 --> 00:22:49,575
I know you.

388
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,551
You're a mischievous little fuck,
but you're not malicious.

389
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,623
Forget about me. Think about Karen,
and think about Becca.

390
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:57,875
This is gonna hurt them.

391
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,585
- Is that what you want?
- Look,

392
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:04,549
it's my story to tell, and my story
includes the fact that I seduced you.

393
00:23:04,882 --> 00:23:06,551
You didn't know how old I was.

394
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,429
It's not like I'm going to
press charges or anything.

395
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,449
You really think that matters
at this point?

396
00:23:11,574 --> 00:23:14,929
Karen loves you. She treated you
like you were her own daughter.

397
00:23:15,054 --> 00:23:17,020
And Becca looks up to you
like a big sister.

398
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:24,652
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

399
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:28,323
It doesn't feel so great, though,
you know, to be famous for no reason.

400
00:23:28,611 --> 00:23:30,783
Sometimes I can go along
with it just fine,

401
00:23:32,034 --> 00:23:33,119
and I remember...

402
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:39,151
That's the thing about secrets, Hank,
they have a funny way of coming out.

403
00:23:39,925 --> 00:23:41,175
You okay, baby?

404
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:43,376
I'm fine... Fine.

405
00:23:46,556 --> 00:23:47,800
Can you just fuck off?

406
00:23:48,153 --> 00:23:49,677
Give us five minutes?

407
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,637
Hank, it doesn't have to be
this way.

408
00:23:52,438 --> 00:23:54,369
We could all just
put our heads together.

409
00:23:54,494 --> 00:23:56,811
We could figure out the best way
to approach this whole thing.

410
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,937
I know that you don't want to upset
your family. I'm sensitive to that.

411
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,774
Really? Yeah, okay.
You're sensitive to that.

412
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:05,026
You don't know anything
about my family.

413
00:24:05,294 --> 00:24:07,153
No, not much.
I'll admit to that.

414
00:24:08,463 --> 00:24:09,864
But from what I do know,

415
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,784
you're not exactly
the model patriarch.

416
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:24,545
Stop! Hank!

417
00:24:36,105 --> 00:24:37,308
You're fucked, Moody.

418
00:24:37,854 --> 00:24:39,504
I'm calling the police.

419
00:24:53,369 --> 00:24:54,369
Hey, you!

420
00:24:55,882 --> 00:24:57,182
I'm almost done!

421
00:24:59,723 --> 00:25:00,823
Proud of me?

422
00:25:04,827 --> 00:25:06,045
Are you excited?

423
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:12,051
What happened?
What the fuck happened to you?

424
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,095
- I'm fine.
- Are you okay?

425
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,264
- I got into a fight.
- What do you mean?

426
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:17,716
I have...

427
00:25:22,872 --> 00:25:24,856
I need to tell you something.

428
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,174
What is it...

429
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,322
What could possibly be this bad?
You look...
