1
00:00:00,893 --> 00:00:00,893
- That's it! Big, top the van!
- What?

2
00:00:01,018 --> 00:00:01,019
Ovitz!
Hit the bricks!

3
00:00:01,143 --> 00:00:01,144
- See you at the Oscars, pal.
- I've been busting my nuts for weeks

4
00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:01,270
just trying to get a meeting
with Ronny Praeger.

5
00:00:01,392 --> 00:00:01,395
- You got Daisy the part!
- I had to invest 100K $ in his movie.

6
00:00:01,517 --> 00:00:01,518
You don't know me. My name
is Hank Moody. I'm a writer.

7
00:00:01,643 --> 00:00:01,645
I want to ask you a question
about Lew Ashby.

8
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:01,894
Call me "he who will kill you
if you touch his daughter."

9
00:00:02,017 --> 00:00:02,019
- She's pretty awesome.
- She is.

10
00:00:02,142 --> 00:00:02,142
That thirsty little nose of
yours is costing us some money.

11
00:00:02,205 --> 00:00:02,267
You just put the bulk of our nest egg
into a movie called <i>Vaginatown</i>.

12
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:02,333
- What's wrong with Clittes?
- Coke dick.

13
00:00:02,458 --> 00:00:02,580
- We're gonna need a stunt cock.
- You will get in there

14
00:00:02,705 --> 00:00:02,769
and drive Miss Daisy.

15
00:00:02,891 --> 00:00:02,894
Did we get that?

16
00:00:03,016 --> 00:00:03,143
Look, I have many vices, my friend,
but jailbait ain't one of them.

17
00:00:03,268 --> 00:00:03,392
Excuse me, gents.

18
00:00:05,637 --> 00:00:07,255
All right, repeat after me.

19
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:08,381
I will never...

20
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,675
- "I will never..."
- ... ever...

21
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:12,927
- "... ever..."
- ... fuck Mia again.

22
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,680
"... fuck Mia again."

23
00:00:16,193 --> 00:00:17,224
Thank you.

24
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:19,017
Jesus. Just saying it gets me wet.

25
00:00:20,845 --> 00:00:21,645
Fuck you.

26
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:23,980
Find somebody else
to pen your sordid, fucking tale.

27
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,180
Don't leave.
We got a good thing going here.

28
00:00:26,305 --> 00:00:28,482
It's been a long time
since I had me a...

29
00:00:28,803 --> 00:00:30,737
- friend.
- Aw, shucks. I'm almost touched.

30
00:00:30,862 --> 00:00:34,616
But you can't expect me to indulge
your every fucking depraved whim!

31
00:00:35,384 --> 00:00:38,620
Jesus Christ. I just realized
what it must be like to live with me.

32
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,374
I really didn't think you were gonna be
such a ninny about the whole thing.

33
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:43,605
A "ninny"?

34
00:00:43,856 --> 00:00:46,210
Because I've had my share
of the tang?

35
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:48,672
Because I have my own
sordid past to contend with?

36
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:51,049
No. Because she told me
that you guys fucked.

37
00:00:54,673 --> 00:00:57,372
- Be that as it may...
- Repeat after me...

38
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:08,317
Subtitles:
www.sub-way.fr (1.00)

39
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:49,857
- You got to get me out of this shit.
- I can't get you out of anything.

40
00:01:49,982 --> 00:01:53,253
- You signed a fucking contract.
- Since when has that ever mattered?

41
00:01:53,378 --> 00:01:56,835
Look, it's either this or you do
the adaptation of <i>Fucking & Punching</i>.

42
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,523
I'm sorry. I take that back.
I don't think I can get you that job.

43
00:02:00,648 --> 00:02:04,146
The guy's gone kurtz.
He needs a doctor, not a biographer.

44
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:06,279
No one said you had to move in
with the guy.

45
00:02:06,404 --> 00:02:08,507
You never do anything halfway,
do you?

46
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:11,105
Says the man holding
the plastic ass-gina.

47
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,460
What the fuck
are we doing here, anyway?

48
00:02:14,296 --> 00:02:17,758
I'm edumacating myself as to
the various marketing opportunities

49
00:02:17,883 --> 00:02:20,033
available to the young porn starlet.

50
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:23,016
Holy shit. You really
like this girl, huh?

51
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,500
Yeah.
Of course I like her.

52
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:27,955
I like her in the kind, paternal way

53
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,398
any agent likes someone
whose career is in his hands.

54
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:32,723
How about in the kind,
paternal way in which a boy

55
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:34,897
sometimes likes to stick
his pee-pee inside a girl?

56
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:36,740
You like her that way, too?

57
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:39,940
I kind of did that already.

58
00:02:40,253 --> 00:02:41,254
What?

59
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:43,543
Nigga, please!

60
00:02:43,668 --> 00:02:45,611
I had to step in and stunt-cock.

61
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:47,374
- That's all.
- "Stunt-cock"?

62
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:50,269
- Long story. You had to be there.
- Stunt-cock.

63
00:02:51,141 --> 00:02:52,649
Holy shit, Johnny Wad.

64
00:02:52,774 --> 00:02:56,772
How we gonna keep you down on the farm
now that you've penetrated a porn star?

65
00:02:57,028 --> 00:02:58,463
Just the tip, then I popped.

66
00:02:58,588 --> 00:03:01,188
Naturally. Here's the deal.
This is what we've got to do.

67
00:03:01,313 --> 00:03:04,432
You got to go home and grab
cokey smurf, meet me at LAX.

68
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:06,842
We got to get
the hell out of town, palomino.

69
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:11,147
I mean, we are down the rabbit hole, and
I'm afraid we ain't never coming back.

70
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:32,386
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

71
00:03:32,675 --> 00:03:34,954
- Jesus Christ, lady!
- You just came out of nowhere.

72
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:37,297
You could've killed me.
I'm gonna have to get your name

73
00:03:37,422 --> 00:03:39,425
for insurance purposes and whatnot.

74
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:44,123
My God. You're that asshole.
Why am I not surprised?

75
00:03:44,248 --> 00:03:47,587
it saddens me to think that when
you have an internal dialog about me,

76
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:50,119
I'm "that asshole" and not
"that handsome stranger"

77
00:03:50,244 --> 00:03:53,345
or "that guy who made a mess
of my bush... Hank Moody."

78
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:56,015
It's nice to see you again, Mrs...?

79
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,362
Jones.

80
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,444
Jones?

81
00:03:58,809 --> 00:04:01,990
Really? After all this intrigue,
that's kind of a letdown.

82
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:04,659
Janie Jones.

83
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:06,786
Like the Clash song.
That's fantastic.

84
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:09,543
I'm half-chubbed.
We forget this whole

85
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:12,000
"vehicular manslaughter" thing
and I buy you a drink?

86
00:04:12,704 --> 00:04:14,085
I don't think so.

87
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,623
I really thought
that the threat of legal action

88
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:18,908
was gonna do it,
but I'm gonna have to employ

89
00:04:19,033 --> 00:04:21,316
my considerable powers of seduction.

90
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:23,132
You ready?

91
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:29,832
I got nothing. That's it. I'm out.

92
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,758
No, tomorrow night,
in Venice, Marat.

93
00:04:33,438 --> 00:04:35,825
I'll be the one staring into
the bottomless pit of despair.

94
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,222
Get there early before I wet myself.

95
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,080
Nailed it!

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,933
That's right... I still got it.

97
00:04:45,381 --> 00:04:48,536
I shouldn't be telling you guys this,
but Becca is my absolute favorite.

98
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:49,684
Thank god!

99
00:04:49,809 --> 00:04:53,041
I thought you were gonna come down on
her for being a Satanist or something.

100
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:57,048
Oh, please. I think it's safe to say
that whole thing's just a phase,

101
00:04:57,173 --> 00:05:00,506
it probably has to do with whatever
might be going on between you two.

102
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:06,346
I'm sorry. She made reference
to some changes at home.

103
00:05:07,252 --> 00:05:09,736
Well, um, long story short, um,

104
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:13,144
we were together,
and now we're apart.

105
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:14,175
Again.

106
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,147
- So, you're divorced?
- Not exactly.

107
00:05:16,455 --> 00:05:19,633
It's okay. I'm not judging.
You know, I'm divorced.

108
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:21,709
- Pretty recently.
- I'm sorry.

109
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:23,363
- Right on!
- Hank.

110
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:26,343
Um, we were never married,
so the divorce thing is...

111
00:05:26,468 --> 00:05:29,457
- No, but I did ask. A number of times.
- Okay, not the time or the place, Hank.

112
00:05:29,582 --> 00:05:32,341
I gave her a ring. She gave it back.
I gave it to a homeless woman.

113
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:33,873
I'm sorry. That's so sad.

114
00:05:34,516 --> 00:05:36,343
It worked out
for the homeless woman.

115
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:40,317
None of that really matters right now.
What matters is that,

116
00:05:40,442 --> 00:05:43,083
we're together
when it comes to raising Becca.

117
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:46,763
Well, yes, but not always. I want
Becca to be a lesbian when she grows up,

118
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,777
and Karen just wants her
to be happy.

119
00:05:48,902 --> 00:05:51,401
That's ridiculous.
Like, you can't be both?

120
00:05:52,623 --> 00:05:53,855
A happy lesbian?

121
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,189
Classy.

122
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,648
I know.
With all the money that we spend,

123
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:00,608
they could afford
some proper glassware.

124
00:06:03,632 --> 00:06:06,155
Hey, have you seen Mia lately?

125
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,366
No. Why?
No more than usual.

126
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:10,576
- What does that mean?
- What does it mean?

127
00:06:10,922 --> 00:06:13,371
I don't know.
What do you mean?

128
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:15,646
No, it's just
I keep stopping by Bill's

129
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:17,621
to check on her,
and she's never home.

130
00:06:17,746 --> 00:06:21,623
So, I know she likes to hang out at
Ashby's den of iniquity, and so do you.

131
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,690
- I have. I have seen her there.
- Right.

132
00:06:23,815 --> 00:06:26,134
Yeah. You know,
once in a while, not often.

133
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:27,996
Does she have a boyfriend?

134
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:30,676
I don't know. What is this,
"Sex and the City", girlfriend?

135
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:32,318
What's with all the questions?

136
00:06:32,443 --> 00:06:34,416
It's just,
last time she came for dinner,

137
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:38,024
she was asking me all these questions
about dating an older man,

138
00:06:38,701 --> 00:06:40,898
and it was like she was kind of
asking my approval.

139
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,234
Well, I hope you
shut that shit down immediately.

140
00:06:43,507 --> 00:06:45,546
No.
I mean, why would I?

141
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,781
You know, it's a perfectly valid
life experience if it's the right guy.

142
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:51,846
- Why would you say something like that?
- Why not?

143
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:56,330
- I dated one of my professors once.
- That's foul.

144
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,541
He was younger
than you are now, actually.

145
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:00,084
I'm nauseous, actually.

146
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,962
The sex was fantastic, actually.

147
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:04,975
Now you're just trying
to get my goat.

148
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,591
- Am I getting it?
- Yes!

149
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:09,510
Now, you'll be the only one to blame
if this thing gets out of hand.

150
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,882
- What thing?
- This gross "older man" thing.

151
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:14,140
No. Well, I want you
to keep an eye out.

152
00:07:14,265 --> 00:07:18,077
I mean, make sure that she
doesn't go anywhere near Ashby.

153
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:20,063
That guy is such a fucking scumbag.

154
00:07:20,512 --> 00:07:22,065
Well, he means well, you know?

155
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:24,150
That sounds familiar.

156
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,306
- I got to go... "Phyllis."
- Goodbye.

157
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:29,636
You're a dick, you know.
Okay, okay.

158
00:07:29,761 --> 00:07:31,671
- Your hair smells good.
- Good.

159
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:34,919
It smells like lady hair.

160
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,229
Hey.

161
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:47,340
Hey yourself, Mrs. P.

162
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:50,177
I just wanted you to know
I love your writing.

163
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:54,138
Quite possibly my four favorite words
in the English language.

164
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,932
Hits all the pleasure centers.

165
00:07:56,584 --> 00:07:58,309
Positively rhapsodic.

166
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,292
I didn't think it was appropriate
to say it in front of your...

167
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:03,108
your ex-wife, lover, or whatever.

168
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,191
I wish you had.
That would've pissed her off.

169
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:07,693
- You like pissing her off, don't you?
- I do.

170
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:10,070
I like pissing off my ex, too.

171
00:08:10,195 --> 00:08:11,805
Cool.
Is he watching?

172
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,201
Yeah, from the window.

173
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:17,126
Well, I'll make sure
to use my good cock.

174
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,940
Just so you know, I'm on my period.

175
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:23,538
Not sure I needed a verbal on that, for
I care very little about such things.

176
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:25,143
I was in Nam.

177
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:28,103
God. My ex always cared.
He thought it was dirty.

178
00:08:28,228 --> 00:08:30,484
Oh, it is dirty...
In a good way.

179
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:34,863
I haven't had time to trim the hedges
lately, if you know what I'm saying.

180
00:08:34,988 --> 00:08:37,117
I do know what you're saying,
and, again, no worries.

181
00:08:37,242 --> 00:08:39,406
I enjoy a generous thicket.

182
00:08:41,008 --> 00:08:42,386
I got to tell you,

183
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,677
your feelings about periods

184
00:08:45,063 --> 00:08:47,255
and pubic hair
have just made me a bigger fan.

185
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,096
It's what I do.
Anything else you care to disclose?

186
00:08:50,632 --> 00:08:52,619
I'm very excited
about fucking you right now.

187
00:08:52,744 --> 00:08:54,906
You are a chatty one,
Mrs. Patterson.

188
00:08:57,675 --> 00:08:58,687
Baby.

189
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,288
Baby!

190
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,959
Look who I found.

191
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:07,128
What happened?
What's wrong?

192
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:10,631
She was sleeping outside
in her fucking car!

193
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:13,342
I didn't want to bother you.
I just didn't know where to go.

194
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,053
My fucking manager showed up
at my apartment and...

195
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,616
You have a manager?

196
00:09:17,993 --> 00:09:21,142
You remember the guy
who was shooting the "slam van" stuff?

197
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:24,312
That smelly, sleazy fuck?
That's your manager?

198
00:09:25,582 --> 00:09:28,608
You're my manager.
He's just a fucking scumbag.

199
00:09:30,377 --> 00:09:32,361
And you didn't think
it was worth mentioning?

200
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:35,090
I was just scared you wouldn't
want to work with me.

201
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,867
And then everything
just happened so fast.

202
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:40,244
- I'm really sorry.
- What does he want?

203
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,997
Money. He wants to be
bought out of his contract.

204
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,633
That's ridiculous.
Clients get poached all the time.

205
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:48,294
I put you in <i>Vaginatown</i>,
I get the commission.

206
00:09:48,464 --> 00:09:51,380
- That's exactly what I told him.
- And what did he say?

207
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,781
He trashed my apartment
and ate all my food.

208
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:55,762
I'm just gonna crash in my car.

209
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,884
I just really don't want
to put you guys out.

210
00:09:58,009 --> 00:09:59,222
Don't be silly.

211
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:01,316
We'll make up the guest room.

212
00:10:01,693 --> 00:10:03,309
Just get into bed, baby.

213
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:05,436
Mommy and daddy will keep you safe.

214
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:07,482
What?!

215
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,399
She's scared shitless.
Come on, Dais.

216
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:13,736
I'm too tired to freshen up
the fucking guest room.

217
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:15,571
Mama needs her sleep.

218
00:10:32,322 --> 00:10:33,322
God.

219
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:35,883
That was exactly what I needed.

220
00:10:36,483 --> 00:10:38,625
Good for you, lady.
Happy to protect and serve.

221
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:40,578
What?

222
00:10:40,918 --> 00:10:42,473
I think I'm gonna cry.

223
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,016
Oh, dear.

224
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:45,223
Don't do that.

225
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:49,897
It's not a bad thing. It's...

226
00:10:50,563 --> 00:10:51,860
Coming makes me cry.

227
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,901
- I mean, on occasion.
- I get that.

228
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:57,196
I mean, sometimes, after I come,
I want to... weep,

229
00:10:57,703 --> 00:10:58,698
you know?

230
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:00,346
But, usually, I just nap.

231
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,151
You know?

232
00:11:03,984 --> 00:11:06,067
You want me to hug you or...

233
00:11:07,356 --> 00:11:08,784
Comfort you in some...

234
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:10,209
fashion?

235
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,385
That's nice of you to offer,
but it's...

236
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:15,218
it's not necessary.

237
00:11:20,145 --> 00:11:21,949
Where's the shitter in this joint?

238
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:24,348
Down the stairs, to the right.

239
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:38,362
Damien?

240
00:11:39,472 --> 00:11:40,484
Mr. Moody?

241
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:46,537
You fucked my mom.

242
00:11:47,485 --> 00:11:49,123
I fucked your mom?

243
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:52,413
I fucked your mom.

244
00:11:56,653 --> 00:11:57,715
Did you hurt her?

245
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,319
No!
You didn't!

246
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:22,448
- I can explain.
- Oh, no, you can't.

247
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:25,159
It's not what it looks like.
She wouldn't listen to reason.

248
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:27,420
I didn't see you put up
much of a fight there, lover.

249
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:30,539
You guys have got to stop this!
This is sick and wrong!

250
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:32,696
Sure.
It's sick and wrong

251
00:12:32,837 --> 00:12:35,336
when he does it, but it's perfectly
fine for you to fuck me.

252
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,213
Stop saying that.
It's not okay.

253
00:12:37,338 --> 00:12:40,625
- That's why we never did it again.
- Never say "never," Hankie.

254
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,385
OK. I promise
I'll never do it again.

255
00:12:42,555 --> 00:12:44,637
You've already done it again
like three times!

256
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,648
Far more than that.

257
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,848
You want Karen to find out
about this, young lady?

258
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:51,299
I don't know, Hank.

259
00:12:51,424 --> 00:12:53,296
Do you want Karen
to find out about this?

260
00:12:53,421 --> 00:12:56,072
Because finding out about this
could mean finding out about us,

261
00:12:56,197 --> 00:12:59,107
which could very well mean
the death of hope, Hank.

262
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,059
What the fuck is this?

263
00:13:24,568 --> 00:13:26,859
Kurt fucking Cobain...

264
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:29,236
played that.

265
00:13:29,452 --> 00:13:31,885
Courtney gave it to me.
I helped her produce a demo,

266
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,259
write some songs.

267
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:34,728
It's yours.

268
00:13:35,076 --> 00:13:37,773
You're giving me Kurt Cobain's
guitar because you fucked Mia?

269
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:40,797
No. I'm giving you
Kurt Cobain's guitar because...

270
00:13:43,196 --> 00:13:46,157
You're my only friend, and I...
Wait, no.

271
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:48,789
Take... care of it.

272
00:13:48,914 --> 00:13:51,305
I mean, you... you can
put Becca through college

273
00:13:52,183 --> 00:13:53,685
with that fucking thing.

274
00:13:55,742 --> 00:13:56,756
Okay.

275
00:13:58,547 --> 00:13:59,627
You hungry?

276
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,799
You like crepes?
I got a new pan I want to try out.

277
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:06,913
That's what I'm gonna do...
I'm gonna make us some crepes.

278
00:14:11,163 --> 00:14:13,567
Becca, it's not
half as crazy as it sounds.

279
00:14:13,858 --> 00:14:15,644
- Fuck you!
- Okay.

280
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,593
But I think that your language

281
00:14:17,718 --> 00:14:19,490
is perhaps a tad inappropriate.

282
00:14:19,615 --> 00:14:21,609
Oh, it's fucking appropriate,
all right.

283
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:23,963
Karen, will you cut me
some slack here?

284
00:14:24,088 --> 00:14:27,656
Do you see me fronting in any way?
I've admitted that I'm wrong, you know.

285
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,868
Still, I don't think that...
You don't talk to your old man that way.

286
00:14:31,124 --> 00:14:34,246
Oh, well, you do if he fucked
your boyfriend's mother.

287
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,625
I didn't know, okay? And I don't like
all this "boyfriend" talk.

288
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:39,205
Of course you didn't know.

289
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,129
How could you ever be expected
to know such a thing?

290
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,547
Yeah, you know what?
You know, if you look at this...

291
00:14:44,672 --> 00:14:46,298
thing in a certain light,

292
00:14:46,868 --> 00:14:48,943
the whole mess can be viewed

293
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:51,264
as almost entirely your fault.

294
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:54,433
Come on.

295
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,878
You didn't tell me about
the boy until the dinner party.

296
00:14:57,003 --> 00:14:59,032
How was I supposed to know
who his mother was?

297
00:14:59,157 --> 00:15:02,391
Oh, well, if you were not
so preoccupied

298
00:15:02,516 --> 00:15:05,804
with sticking your dick
in any hole that will have you,

299
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:07,530
you might notice these things.

300
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,783
But you kicked my dick out of the house.
You made my dick homeless.

301
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:14,543
And out of doors is a place
where penises don't generally fare well

302
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:18,082
- in the rain and the wind and all that.
- Hank, shut up?

303
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,476
My homeless dick
now must seek shelter

304
00:15:20,601 --> 00:15:23,210
from the storm
where and whence it can.

305
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:26,465
Did she say to you, "oh, Hank,
I love your writing"?

306
00:15:26,753 --> 00:15:28,958
You see that? This is why
we should be together.

307
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,808
- You know my shit. It's perfect.
- It's why we shouldn't be together.

308
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,099
She needed a good cry. She was lonely.
What's the harm?

309
00:15:35,478 --> 00:15:36,724
The harm?

310
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:39,524
Oh, well, the harm
is right there, okay?

311
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:41,668
That is the harm... Big harm.

312
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:44,525
And the worst part is
she was defending you.

313
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:48,789
- What do you mean?
- He didn't break it off with her.

314
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,560
He just said that you were a dick
for sleeping with his mother.

315
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:54,671
- That's legitimate.
- But that did not sit well with her

316
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,037
because no one talks shit

317
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,737
about her beloved father.

318
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,541
So she broke it off with him.

319
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:03,900
Fuck.

320
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:15,370
Don't you dare touch me.

321
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:21,658
Kurt Cobain played this guitar.

322
00:16:22,522 --> 00:16:25,835
If you treat it right, you'll never
have to work another day in your life.

323
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,871
You can't buy your way
out of this one.

324
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,105
Damien was right...

325
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:32,906
You are a dick.

326
00:16:42,862 --> 00:16:45,145
Hey, Mrs. Patterson.
Is Damien home?

327
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,589
He's... not here. He's at band practice.
Do you want to come in?

328
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:51,800
I don't think that would be
such a great idea.

329
00:16:52,063 --> 00:16:54,020
Don't let him scare you.
He's a good kid.

330
00:16:54,145 --> 00:16:57,062
- He's very protective of his mother.
- That's a good thing.

331
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,479
I mean, we can't let our kids

332
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:04,146
ruin a perfectly excellent
sexual chemistry, can we?

333
00:17:04,658 --> 00:17:07,701
Jesus. When you put it that way,
it sounds pretty fucking reasonable.

334
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,099
Can you write that down
for me for later

335
00:17:10,224 --> 00:17:12,363
- in case I need to use it?
- Old man, I will go

336
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:14,490
fucking medieval on your ass!

337
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,023
Settle down, townshend.
I came here to talk to you, <i>mano a mano</i>.

338
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:22,498
- Come on.
- Settle down, buddy. What is it?

339
00:17:22,928 --> 00:17:24,249
What can I do for you?

340
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,130
Let's figure this out.
Come on.

341
00:17:28,196 --> 00:17:29,542
Okay. Here we go.

342
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:31,164
Come on, man.

343
00:17:31,587 --> 00:17:34,601
- What can I do for you?
- Nothing. There's nothing you can do.

344
00:17:35,176 --> 00:17:39,139
- You're dead to me, and Becca is too.
- That's a shame. That's a crying shame

345
00:17:39,264 --> 00:17:42,167
because she appears to be
very fond of you.

346
00:17:44,242 --> 00:17:45,247
Really?

347
00:17:46,222 --> 00:17:47,398
What'd she say?

348
00:17:48,447 --> 00:17:51,402
Nothing that I could ever
repeat without vomiting.

349
00:17:52,123 --> 00:17:54,066
Now, come on.
What can we do?

350
00:17:54,191 --> 00:17:55,406
Let's figure this out.

351
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,991
Okay. First of all, repeat after me.

352
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:02,651
"I will never...

353
00:18:03,243 --> 00:18:04,543
"I will never...

354
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:06,166
- "... ever...
- "... ever...

355
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:08,206
"... ever...

356
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:09,820
"... ever...

357
00:18:11,444 --> 00:18:13,090
"... fuck my mom again."

358
00:18:13,361 --> 00:18:14,854
"... fuck my mom again."

359
00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:16,510
Fuck your mom again.

360
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,750
Boys,
we don't have to be so quick to...

361
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,223
Fine.
Whatever you want.

362
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:26,141
We good?
Anything else?

363
00:18:28,324 --> 00:18:29,898
What's up with the guitar?

364
00:18:32,796 --> 00:18:34,848
Ladies, I am home!

365
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,360
Here's Mr. Big fucking
Hollywood agent.

366
00:18:37,485 --> 00:18:40,242
Steal any fucking clients
on the way here, you bald motherfucker?

367
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,910
Is everybody okay here?

368
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,788
Yeah. I think it's called
a "pimp go get."

369
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,334
You come to my house,

370
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:50,111
you push around a couple of girls.

371
00:18:50,236 --> 00:18:53,088
You could have called, texted,
we work this out ourselves.

372
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,749
You poached my girl.

373
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:56,884
That skank, she belongs to me.

374
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:00,985
Sweetheart, put those fingers away.
Who knows where they've been?

375
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,307
Wait a sec, I fucking do.
They've been in my ass.

376
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:06,310
- That was one time.
- Yeah. One good time. Hey, jerk-off,

377
00:19:06,593 --> 00:19:08,437
you know what a fucking contract is?

378
00:19:14,595 --> 00:19:17,654
- This is not a very good deal, Daisy.
- You think?

379
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,699
Bad news, you're connected to
Gilbert Gottfried here for life.

380
00:19:21,372 --> 00:19:24,564
Good news, this will never
hold up in court, asshole.

381
00:19:24,689 --> 00:19:26,583
Maybe not, Perry mason,
but guess what?

382
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,974
A lot of not-nice shit
can happen during that time.

383
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:30,834
You wanna fucking take that chance?

384
00:19:31,946 --> 00:19:33,504
Motherless cunt bastard!

385
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:35,005
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you!

386
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,634
Okay. You know, ,
that wasn't very nice at all.

387
00:19:38,924 --> 00:19:41,136
That's my soy milk,
and I have serious dairy issues.

388
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:43,806
- I bet you do.
- I want you out of my house.

389
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:45,015
Now. And, you,

390
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:47,267
please put my wife down.

391
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,363
I got no problem with that,
but Daisy,

392
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:52,356
she's coming with me. Sweetheart,
Come on, honey. We've got a past.

393
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:55,318
You know that whole speculum series
we wanted to do?

394
00:19:55,443 --> 00:19:58,153
I think the time is right. Come on,
let's make some porn!

395
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,866
- How much you want for her?
- She's not a fucking slave, Charlie!

396
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,646
You know what, pal?
I believe in this girl!

397
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,423
Yeah. She is gonna be a huge star
one day.

398
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:10,332
<i>Vaginatown</i> is just the beginning.

399
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:12,501
There will be much ruing
of this day.

400
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,462
Ruing, right. Big fucking star.
Jenna fucking Jameson.

401
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:18,550
Wait a second.
There's fucking Chinese! Big! Nice!

402
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,877
Okay, look. It's all gonna be okay.
Everything's cool.

403
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:24,555
I'm gonna give him some money
from the emergency fund.

404
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,479
- No, no, baby.
- Baby, you said it yourself,

405
00:20:27,604 --> 00:20:29,032
She's family, okay?

406
00:20:29,157 --> 00:20:31,895
And that's what the money's for,
emergencies.

407
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,648
- I can't let you do this.
- What's the alternative?

408
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,204
If you go back with him, 

409
00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:39,139
you'll be starring in your own line
of gynecological training films.

410
00:20:39,264 --> 00:20:41,572
- Not on my watch.
- Okay. Baby. Baby!

411
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:45,048
- Maybe you should write him a check.
- I will give him what...

412
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:50,957
All of it?

413
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,670
You spent all of it?

414
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,073
That was my mad money, baby.

415
00:20:59,976 --> 00:21:02,384
Pleasure doing business
with you, captain jackass!

416
00:21:11,276 --> 00:21:12,519
I love that car.

417
00:21:17,883 --> 00:21:19,265
I'm sorry, daddy.

418
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,362
I don't know what happened to me.

419
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:24,552
You're going to your mother's.

420
00:21:25,219 --> 00:21:28,366
But going to my mother's
makes me want to do drugs!

421
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:31,246
- A lot of 'em!
- I don't want to hear it.

422
00:21:31,942 --> 00:21:34,250
It's a good place
for you to chill out.

423
00:21:39,044 --> 00:21:40,439
Whatever you say, daddy.

424
00:21:40,564 --> 00:21:43,467
I'll help you knock this monkey
off your back, baby.

425
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,363
If you let me.

426
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,466
Where are we going?

427
00:22:00,591 --> 00:22:02,661
Nowhere.
Just going for a walk.

428
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:05,711
- No one walks in L.A.
- We do.

429
00:22:06,247 --> 00:22:08,000
Always have, always will.

430
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:09,667
We're New Yorkers.

431
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:11,767
There is no "always."

432
00:22:11,892 --> 00:22:13,557
There's just right now.

433
00:22:14,403 --> 00:22:17,110
You don't like me very much
right now, do you?

434
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:18,920
No. I don't.

435
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,321
You know,
I know I say this too much...

436
00:22:22,446 --> 00:22:24,100
All the time, probably,

437
00:22:24,864 --> 00:22:26,999
but I was wrong to do what I did,

438
00:22:27,124 --> 00:22:28,512
and I was wrong to...

439
00:22:28,957 --> 00:22:31,114
be so glib about trying to fix it.

440
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,210
There is no right or wrong, dad,

441
00:22:34,335 --> 00:22:36,846
just the consequences
of your actions.

442
00:22:37,413 --> 00:22:38,938
You taught me that.

443
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:43,568
I guess I don't like the consequences
of my actions very much right now.

444
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:46,201
Me neither.

445
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:50,494
So...

446
00:22:51,482 --> 00:22:54,360
What is it that you like so much
about this boy?

447
00:22:54,485 --> 00:22:56,358
- I don't know.
- Come on.

448
00:22:57,005 --> 00:22:59,627
It's got to be something.
Use your words.

449
00:23:00,673 --> 00:23:02,056
He's really smart.

450
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:04,214
Let's not go crazy.

451
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,337
And he makes me feel pretty.

452
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:10,431
Well, that you are.
You're very pretty. You're beautiful.

453
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,299
Shut up. I'm not beautiful.

454
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:13,988
Don't say that. Look.

455
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:16,039
Don't ever say that. You are...

456
00:23:16,164 --> 00:23:18,687
beautiful. You're the most
beautiful thing in the world to me.

457
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:20,439
Then treat me that way.

458
00:23:21,077 --> 00:23:23,233
I'm always on your side, dad,
always.

459
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:26,229
Even when I shouldn't be.
But I'm sick of it.

460
00:23:26,354 --> 00:23:29,023
Get your shit together
before it's too late!

461
00:23:29,148 --> 00:23:32,540
I don't care if you and mom never say
another kind word to each other,

462
00:23:32,665 --> 00:23:35,091
but I'm sick and tired
of parenting you both.

463
00:23:35,216 --> 00:23:36,573
I'm a fucking kid!

464
00:23:36,698 --> 00:23:39,126
I don't know what I'm doing
half the time.

465
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,751
But I do know this:

466
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:43,805
If you keep cracking jokes
and taking another drink

467
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,017
and pretending that life
is one big, stupid party,

468
00:23:47,142 --> 00:23:48,941
you will miss everything.

469
00:24:06,157 --> 00:24:07,679
You have fun, okay?

470
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,869
Not too much fun.

471
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,336
Hey, Damien.

472
00:24:25,857 --> 00:24:27,841
Can I take you down
to the guitar center

473
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,925
and get you something cooler
than that one?

474
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:32,868
No, man. This guitar is awesome.
It's like...

475
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,472
Something Cobain would have played.

476
00:24:36,836 --> 00:24:37,836
Awesome.

477
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:42,630
Have fun, honey.

478
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:47,763
May I have another, please?

479
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:50,002
I don't think so.

480
00:24:50,297 --> 00:24:51,780
Really?
Am I that sloshed?

481
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,619
No. But if I'm gonna
take you home with me,

482
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:57,202
I don't want you to be
at... half-mast.

483
00:24:59,685 --> 00:25:01,039
I'm so flattered.

484
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:04,084
I just don't think I'd be
very good company for anybody tonight.

485
00:25:04,831 --> 00:25:06,628
Why not?
I've heard good things.

486
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:08,793
No, I am very agreeable.

487
00:25:08,918 --> 00:25:11,686
And you are nothing
if not a beautiful barmaid.

488
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:13,766
I've just got a little too much...

489
00:25:13,891 --> 00:25:16,747
of my daughter's voice
running around in my head right now

490
00:25:16,872 --> 00:25:19,365
to be good company for anybody.
That's not as creepy

491
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,934
as it sounds, either.

492
00:25:21,226 --> 00:25:22,226
Honestly.

493
00:25:23,347 --> 00:25:24,347
So,

494
00:25:24,755 --> 00:25:28,105
tonight, I think you're just gonna
have to settle for...

495
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:30,045
The tip!

496
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:31,520
Just the tip!

497
00:25:31,893 --> 00:25:33,579
Get it? Got it? Good.

498
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,455
Good night, Hank.

499
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:38,650
Good night, beautiful barmaid.

500
00:25:43,482 --> 00:25:44,679
Am I too late?

501
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:46,903
Did you already wet yourself?

502
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,600
So, What are we drinking?
