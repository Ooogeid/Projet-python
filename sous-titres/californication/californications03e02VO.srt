1
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:05,144
- No one wants to publish your book.
- This is a big fuckin' bummer.

2
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:07,882
I could really use an influx
of "cashish" right about now.

3
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:10,259
Quit beating your meat.

4
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:13,766
Becca's dad, right?

5
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:17,141
- Chelsea's mom?
- Speak of the she-devils.

6
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,518
- Can I go over to Chelsea's?
- Stay for dinner.

7
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:23,074
I'd like to introduce you
to Richard Bates, the writer.

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,066
He's going to be
teaching here this year.

9
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:26,692
- Big fan.
- Drink with me.

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,195
- Ten years' sobriety down the drain.
- Fuck me.

11
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,239
I can't afford to keep paying rent
and mortgage at the same time.

12
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,784
- Okay. I'll move back in.
- This can't be right.

13
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,315
It's within his right.

14
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,705
You're the dean of this fine institute
of fancy book learning?

15
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,999
- Correct.
- Who wants to see me tuck

16
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,417
and do the pee-pee dance?

17
00:00:46,493 --> 00:00:48,579
- Let's get your clothes.
- What about Bates?

18
00:00:48,704 --> 00:00:50,591
- He can do this?
- From rehab?

19
00:00:50,832 --> 00:00:51,882
I doubt it.

20
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:55,088
You wouldn't happen to know
of any other

21
00:00:55,213 --> 00:00:58,418
bad boy novelists looking
for a teaching gig, would you?

22
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,661
How are things at work, teach?

23
00:01:22,786 --> 00:01:26,347
Excellent question, cougar smurf.
Aside from the fact that I generally

24
00:01:26,472 --> 00:01:28,754
loathe the young people,
it's a pretty cush gig.

25
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,215
And we're keeping our hands
off the young nubiles, are we?

26
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,718
Please. Teenage girls
are greatly overrated.

27
00:01:34,055 --> 00:01:36,137
Present company excepted, of course.

28
00:01:36,458 --> 00:01:37,388
Of course.

29
00:01:41,176 --> 00:01:43,746
Are you okay over there?
Are you stroking out or something?

30
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:46,474
- Whatever do you mean?
- You're grinning like a Mongoloid.

31
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,566
No, I think
I'm just feeling grateful.

32
00:01:48,981 --> 00:01:51,777
- This seems like old times, don't it?
- Here we go.

33
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:54,532
Truth be told, I remember the food
being a hell of a lot better.

34
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:55,906
What about this steak?

35
00:01:56,345 --> 00:01:58,872
- Tastes like prison ass.
- Becca. Miss.

36
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,037
You're not eating.
What's wrong with you?

37
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:03,956
Nothing. I'm on a diet.

38
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:07,960
You are a beautiful, young,
white woman. Remember that.

39
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,403
- You do not need to be on a diet.
- Dad, I could easily lose ten pounds.

40
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:14,218
Your mother would kill me
if you developing anorexia.

41
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,893
I like me a big girl.

42
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:19,847
Before Marcy here, most of
my girlfriends were somewhat zaftig.

43
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,552
I remember that. Your apartment
was like half off at Lane Bryant.

44
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:24,658
That's right, that's right.
Big and getable.

45
00:02:24,783 --> 00:02:26,237
That's the way I liked 'em.

46
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,881
And then old half-pint here
came along and...

47
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:31,370
Oh, god. Please cut
the sweet talk, will you?

48
00:02:31,495 --> 00:02:33,363
We're not together. We're living together.

49
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:35,154
There is a huge difference.

50
00:02:35,424 --> 00:02:37,128
I've made my intentions known.

51
00:02:37,488 --> 00:02:39,200
Love will find a way.

52
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:44,277
Sit, relax, eat, enjoy.

53
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,204
I will get it.

54
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:54,247
I'm sorry, my Nubian brother.
We're right in the middle of dinner.

55
00:02:54,372 --> 00:02:57,635
- We're not interested this evening. Ta.
- Not interested in what, exactly?

56
00:02:58,124 --> 00:02:59,940
Whatever it is
you're selling, brother.

57
00:03:00,065 --> 00:03:03,057
- Let me guess. Magazine subscriptions?
- I'm here for Marcy.

58
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,376
My wife?

59
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:08,051
I'm here to pick up Marcy.
For our date.

60
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:12,442
Thank you.

61
00:03:15,132 --> 00:03:17,196
See you around, my Nubian brother.

62
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,385
"The shy, talented vampire looked up
to his centuries-old mentor.

63
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,239
"Even in the twilight
of his eternal youth,

64
00:04:17,364 --> 00:04:20,050
"the old man was wicked-smart
and roguishly handsome,

65
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:23,462
"a glint of the devil flickering
in his beautiful, undead eyes.

66
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:26,431
"The young vampire knew
there was much to be learned

67
00:04:26,556 --> 00:04:30,054
from his blood-sucking mentor...
how to live, how to feed,

68
00:04:30,318 --> 00:04:31,418
how to fuck.

69
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,999
"But the boy was hungry.

70
00:04:34,124 --> 00:04:35,404
"Ravenous, actually.

71
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,243
"Soon he would have to feed,
and feed he would.

72
00:04:39,435 --> 00:04:42,108
"The moronic frat boys that
mocked him on a daily basis

73
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:44,023
"were good for something at least. "

74
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,003
I'm just texting with my daughter.

75
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,589
It's the only time she actually
acknowledges my existence.

76
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:01,343
Okay, so what about Balt's story?

77
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,796
I heard something about vampires
and frat boys and cum,

78
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:06,597
so I'm half-chubbed. How about the rest
of you spoiled, rich kids?

79
00:05:09,165 --> 00:05:10,165
Someone?

80
00:05:10,838 --> 00:05:11,838
Anyone?

81
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:13,779
Bueller?

82
00:05:14,499 --> 00:05:15,499
Bueller.

83
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:19,151
What say ye, Jackie?

84
00:05:21,395 --> 00:05:23,030
He's my roommate.
He'll get mad at me.

85
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:25,853
Maybe, but ultimately
he'll thank you

86
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:28,391
for having the balls
to say something of substance.

87
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:34,643
Well, I've told him a thousand times
he needs to drop the vampire bullshit.

88
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:35,868
It's stupid.

89
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:38,145
You're not a fucking creature
of the night.

90
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,458
Says you, slut.

91
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,674
- See? What'd I tell you?
- Anything else?

92
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:45,502
Well, there was an awful
lot of talk about fucking,

93
00:05:45,627 --> 00:05:48,180
but no actual sex.
That kind of bummed me out.

94
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,305
It is possible
that longing for something

95
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,101
is better than actually having it.

96
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:55,511
I've heard it said that satisfaction
is the death of desire.

97
00:05:55,777 --> 00:05:57,411
Interesting.
Do you need a tampon?

98
00:05:57,536 --> 00:05:59,233
I think I have an extra in my purse.

99
00:06:00,654 --> 00:06:02,098
Look at the time already.

100
00:06:02,748 --> 00:06:04,473
Actually, there's 15 minutes left.

101
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,936
Which is why
I will leave you with this.

102
00:06:08,103 --> 00:06:09,743
I can't teach you how to write,

103
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:12,300
and anybody who says they can
is full of shit.

104
00:06:12,795 --> 00:06:14,289
The only thing I can do is write

105
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,001
about the shit that excites me,
the shit that gets me hard.

106
00:06:17,388 --> 00:06:19,169
So, Balt, if you want to write about

107
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,672
vampires drinking each other's blood
and cum and whatnot,

108
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:24,216
by all means, go for it.
Write the shit out of it.

109
00:06:24,532 --> 00:06:26,192
Don't be niggardly
with your emotions.

110
00:06:26,317 --> 00:06:28,464
Just run it up the flagpole
and see who salutes.

111
00:06:29,586 --> 00:06:32,147
Now get the fuck out of here.
Go read a book or something.

112
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:33,635
Preferably one of mine.

113
00:06:38,484 --> 00:06:40,357
You know, I try not
to think about it too much,

114
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,051
but I could have been T.A.- ing
for Richard Bates right now,

115
00:06:43,176 --> 00:06:45,482
and that would have been
a real education for me.

116
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:47,573
I was doing my thesis on him.

117
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:51,035
Yeah, and then you had to go
and knock him off the wagon.

118
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,172
Look how it worked out for you.
You get to learn

119
00:06:53,297 --> 00:06:55,447
at the feet of a master... bator.

120
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:57,666
Clearly.

121
00:06:58,612 --> 00:06:59,626
Hi, Felicia.

122
00:07:01,152 --> 00:07:04,202
- How's it going, professor?
- In a word? Awesome.

123
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:09,895
- Interesting curriculum.
- Look at that.

124
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,628
I sound like a fuckin' retard.

125
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,655
Don't be so hard on yourself.

126
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,039
But you might want to erase it
before word spreads

127
00:07:16,164 --> 00:07:19,021
through these hallowed halls.
Academics can be vicious.

128
00:07:19,376 --> 00:07:22,441
At least I'm not tucking my dong
in class. Not with my pants off, anyway.

129
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:25,736
Have you taken the sexual
harassment seminar, yet?

130
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,696
I had Jill take it for me online.

131
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:36,122
It's like traffic school.

132
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,423
David Curran wants to know
why you gave him a "c".

133
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:46,098
Okay, I'll bite.
Why'd I give him a "c"?

134
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:50,719
You know, as your T.A., I'm happy
to read the students' material

135
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,014
and suggest a grade, but, you know,
you're supposed to read it also.

136
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,559
What do you think of Jackie?

137
00:07:57,692 --> 00:08:00,735
- You think she's hot, don't you?
- I haven't thought about it.

138
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,066
- Now that I have, yeah, she's smoking.
- You're old enough to be her father.

139
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,596
Well, sure, I could be, but I'm not.

140
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:08,695
And I have no interest
in making sweet love to her

141
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,948
aside from the general interest
that all men have

142
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:14,468
- in making sweet love to all women.
- I think I can't be your T.A. anymore.

143
00:08:14,593 --> 00:08:15,994
- I understand.
- You do?

144
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,080
You find me irresistible.

145
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,875
That's close. I find you irritating.

146
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:24,611
Careful. That's how it starts.
The mother of my problem child

147
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:27,367
would say the exact same thing.
Seriously. Watch it.

148
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:29,214
Has a woman ever
punched you in the face?

149
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:31,593
You know what?
You should use me.

150
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,950
Really?

151
00:08:33,353 --> 00:08:35,055
I should use you.
I'm frightened.

152
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,142
As consultant... in your search
for worthy companionship.

153
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,561
I, Hank Moody, am a prime example

154
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,329
of how the male noggin works.

155
00:08:42,636 --> 00:08:44,447
You say you're out
on a date with some dick,

156
00:08:44,572 --> 00:08:47,153
he does something you can't
quite decipher, you call me up...

157
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,311
I'll tell you what it meant.

158
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,575
Thanks, dick. That's a great idea.

159
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,595
I'm gonna think about it
while I'm peeing.

160
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,970
Tinkle, tinkle.

161
00:08:57,718 --> 00:08:58,862
Professor Moody,

162
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:00,517
can I have a word?

163
00:09:00,642 --> 00:09:03,250
I suppose so, but I was thinking
of ducking out and catching a movie.

164
00:09:04,757 --> 00:09:07,434
But I guess not.
Office hours and whatnot.

165
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,014
Come in. Have a seat.

166
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:10,215
Call me Hank.

167
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,012
I changed my mind.
Call me professor Moody.

168
00:09:16,564 --> 00:09:19,014
I'm just fucking with you.
Not really.

169
00:09:21,397 --> 00:09:23,897
- What do you want?
- I need to know...

170
00:09:24,756 --> 00:09:26,056
if I'm a writer.

171
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:29,109
Jesus Christ.
Who am I to tell you that?

172
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,070
You're my teacher. I respect you,
and I think you're an awesome writer.

173
00:09:32,373 --> 00:09:34,198
- Thank you.
- I've read all your books.

174
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:35,573
Cover to cover.

175
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,535
I love your picture on the back,
by the way. It's very handsome.

176
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,289
You're the mentor, you know?

177
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:47,566
In my story? The young vampire
has a crush on the old one.

178
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:51,066
It's you.
It's a metaphor.

179
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:53,884
I'm the old vampire.
Fantastic.

180
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,352
Come on, Hank...

181
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:56,777
Professor Moody.

182
00:09:58,483 --> 00:09:59,633
Brutal truth.

183
00:10:00,256 --> 00:10:01,516
I can take it.

184
00:10:02,347 --> 00:10:03,560
Brutal truth?

185
00:10:04,808 --> 00:10:05,858
Absolutely.

186
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:10,746
Your story was bad.

187
00:10:11,347 --> 00:10:12,486
It was terrible.

188
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,074
It was like that lame Twilight bullshit.
I have no patience for that crap.

189
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,821
It's like bound toilet paper.

190
00:10:18,946 --> 00:10:20,744
I'm not saying you won't get better,

191
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,962
because you will.
No question.

192
00:10:23,858 --> 00:10:25,776
But I am saying
that if you can do anything else

193
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:27,793
with your life right now,
anything at all,

194
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:30,462
I think maybe you should do that.

195
00:10:30,803 --> 00:10:33,924
'Cause the world doesn't need
lame vampire fiction. You know?

196
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,761
You with me, amigo?

197
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:39,638
I think so.

198
00:10:40,685 --> 00:10:42,185
Brutal truth, right?

199
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,567
Right.

200
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:52,284
Teaching's not so hard.

201
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:57,283
I feel bad.
He was clearly crushing on me.

202
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:58,858
Maybe I led him on.

203
00:10:59,623 --> 00:11:00,424
How so?

204
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:02,594
I don't know.
Maybe I was sending out signals.

205
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,580
- Fuck. Maybe I'm gay.
- Hank, please.

206
00:11:05,849 --> 00:11:06,832
We're all gay.

207
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,958
What the?

208
00:11:08,261 --> 00:11:09,361
I'm serious.

209
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,045
- I know, and it scares me.
- Let me put it this way.

210
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,524
- If we were trapped on a desert island,
- I don't like where this is going.

211
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:18,302
it would only be a matter of time
before I was putting it in your pooper.

212
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,533
I may be easy,
but I am not sleazy.

213
00:11:21,658 --> 00:11:23,432
I don't really see myself
as a bottom.

214
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,975
You put it in my pooper.

215
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:27,493
My fist, maybe.

216
00:11:27,618 --> 00:11:29,004
Whatever floats your boat.

217
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:31,784
My point being, we're just animals.

218
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,444
This animal prefers the warm,
cozy confines of the female vagina.

219
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,558
But faced
with a severe vaginal drought,

220
00:11:37,683 --> 00:11:40,240
men will be men.
Boys will do boys.

221
00:11:40,853 --> 00:11:43,035
You've given this a fair amount
of thought, haven't you?

222
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,203
It's like when you were a kid?

223
00:11:45,882 --> 00:11:48,081
- You know what I'm saying?
- No, I do not.

224
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,251
We've all got a gay experience
or two in our back pockets.

225
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:55,797
Now... Now I see where you're going.
What's yours?

226
00:11:56,859 --> 00:11:59,134
- You first.
- No way. Bald before beauty.

227
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,614
You know? Fine. Okay.

228
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:04,931
So when I was growing up,
my best friend was Mike Metz.

229
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,715
Sometimes, we would undress,

230
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:12,255
we'd lay down on the bed,
and just, you know,

231
00:12:12,772 --> 00:12:14,649
touch each other's bodies.
It wasn't gay.

232
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,849
It wasn't even sexual.

233
00:12:16,974 --> 00:12:18,731
It was, you know,
very loving, act...

234
00:12:18,856 --> 00:12:21,767
it was just an expression
of our friendship. That's all.

235
00:12:21,892 --> 00:12:23,679
That's interesting,
because we are friends,

236
00:12:23,804 --> 00:12:26,552
and yet you've never asked me
to get undressed and touch your body.

237
00:12:26,677 --> 00:12:28,538
So what's yours, big boy?

238
00:12:31,171 --> 00:12:32,205
You tricked me.

239
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,712
You miserable fucking bastard.
You keep that one close to your vest.

240
00:12:36,138 --> 00:12:37,796
Of course.

241
00:12:52,426 --> 00:12:55,844
- You're gonna rape me, aren't you?
- You bet your sweet ass, rich lady.

242
00:12:55,969 --> 00:12:57,554
- I'm not rich!
- Bullshit!

243
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,225
You own a salon.
Don't lie to me.

244
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:01,769
Put that thing away.

245
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:05,898
- That big, thick, purple thing!
- That's right. You better recognize.

246
00:13:06,396 --> 00:13:09,246
This here's a one-eyed, one-horned,
flying, purple, white-woman eater.

247
00:13:09,768 --> 00:13:12,218
And I'm gonna split you
like wet pine.

248
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:18,171
No means no, you know?

249
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,091
- This the surprise ?
- What the fuck are you doing?

250
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,325
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm saving you.

251
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,679
Saving me?
I'm fine!

252
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,556
No, you're not fine.
You're being raped.

253
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,350
I am not!

254
00:13:32,218 --> 00:13:33,145
You were too.

255
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,482
We're playing a game.

256
00:13:37,746 --> 00:13:38,942
A game?

257
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:43,238
What kind of game? Some kind of sick,
twisted, plantation-days kind of thing?

258
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,848
Watch it, motherfucker.

259
00:13:45,973 --> 00:13:47,742
It was a fantasy, charlie.

260
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:48,952
A fantasy?

261
00:13:49,892 --> 00:13:51,288
A rape fantasy.

262
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,291
A rape fanta...?
That is just sick, Marcy.

263
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,209
Sick?

264
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:57,209
I'm sick?

265
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,465
After all the twisted, depraved shit

266
00:14:00,772 --> 00:14:02,215
i've seen you do?

267
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,219
Don't you dare
judge me, motherfucker.

268
00:14:07,895 --> 00:14:09,181
I think I'm gonna puke.

269
00:14:09,717 --> 00:14:10,390
Good!

270
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:22,055
Dean Koons wants to see you.

271
00:14:23,606 --> 00:14:24,237
Hit?

272
00:14:24,841 --> 00:14:25,791
I'm good.

273
00:14:29,846 --> 00:14:30,846
Hey, guys.

274
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,207
For what?

275
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:38,559
You want to see me,
which could only mean you wanted

276
00:14:38,684 --> 00:14:40,921
to congratulate me
for the kickass job i've been doing,

277
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,173
so I just wanted to say
you're welcome.

278
00:14:44,054 --> 00:14:45,421
It's been my pleasure.

279
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,722
- This is no time to be glib, Hank.
- How can you be sure?

280
00:14:49,314 --> 00:14:51,014
I'll handle this, Stacy.

281
00:14:51,742 --> 00:14:53,207
There's been an incident.

282
00:14:54,064 --> 00:14:57,521
Okay, well, look.
"Niggardly" is not a racial slur.

283
00:14:58,381 --> 00:15:00,899
And in fact, one might say
that y'all have been niggardly

284
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,775
when it comes
to financial compensation <i>pour moi.</i>

285
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,025
I'm just saying.

286
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:06,836
Are you done handling this?

287
00:15:06,961 --> 00:15:09,188
Because we are dealing
with an idiot man-child here.

288
00:15:09,735 --> 00:15:11,870
"Me love her too much.

289
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,288
"Me pet her too hard.

290
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,417
"She no wake up."

291
00:15:21,735 --> 00:15:24,172
A student of yours tried
to commit suicide last night.

292
00:15:27,043 --> 00:15:27,993
Shitness.

293
00:15:29,802 --> 00:15:31,263
- Who?
- Chris Smith.

294
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:32,713
Chris Smith?

295
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:35,873
Chris Smith.
He's not one of mine.

296
00:15:35,998 --> 00:15:36,935
Thank God.

297
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,520
No, his friends call him Balt.

298
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:39,561
Balt?

299
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:41,719
Fuck, I know that dude.

300
00:15:41,844 --> 00:15:43,825
Did he seem despondent at all?

301
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,861
His roommate said he had just returned
from a meeting with you.

302
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,379
He did stop by...

303
00:15:48,808 --> 00:15:50,365
my office-es.

304
00:15:52,032 --> 00:15:54,828
- What was discussed?
- Life... love...

305
00:15:55,467 --> 00:15:57,314
vampires and shit.

306
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,324
We're not attacking you. We're just
trying to work out what happened.

307
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:04,087
- It's pretty clear what happened.
- Stop being so condescending, Stacy.

308
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:06,742
Look, why don't you just tender
your resignation right now.

309
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:09,134
Spare us the trouble
of an investigation.

310
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,552
You want to handle this?

311
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,900
Fine. Go right ahead.

312
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:13,513
Just Ieave me out of it.

313
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:19,352
Someone's sleeping
on the couch tonight.

314
00:16:20,618 --> 00:16:21,968
Good jelly beans.

315
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:26,318
I know you're not exactly

316
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,529
what anyone
would call an education professional.

317
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,073
Or a professional of any kind,
for that matter.

318
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,075
But my wife went out
on a limb for you.

319
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,661
She loves Becca.

320
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,813
She thought it would be nice
if her father was gainfully employed.

321
00:16:42,564 --> 00:16:43,778
That being said...

322
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:45,899
That's an antique.

323
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:51,133
If you said or did anything
to push that poor kid over the edge,

324
00:16:51,258 --> 00:16:54,804
I'm gonna make it my work to make sure
you never step foot here again.

325
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:56,960
Do you understand me?

326
00:16:57,085 --> 00:16:58,535
Do I have your ear?

327
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:01,978
You have beautiful, blue eyes.

328
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,440
- Are you high?
- I gotta run.

329
00:17:09,765 --> 00:17:11,029
Talk to you later.

330
00:17:15,772 --> 00:17:18,620
All work and no ass-play
makes Chuck a dull boy.

331
00:17:19,118 --> 00:17:20,935
Just trying to earn my keep, Sue.

332
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,708
What do you say the two of us
knock off early?

333
00:17:24,305 --> 00:17:25,877
Slip out of this business casual,

334
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,589
nude-up in my "jacooze", see
what kind of sodomy laws we can break?

335
00:17:30,747 --> 00:17:32,820
Sounds like the height
of decadence, Sue.

336
00:17:32,945 --> 00:17:35,189
But I should probably
get through this slush pile.

337
00:17:35,314 --> 00:17:37,316
Who knows? I might even
find something good.

338
00:17:37,441 --> 00:17:41,434
Who knows? You might find
something better in my punani.

339
00:17:43,517 --> 00:17:45,522
Warren Beatty's lost Rolex, maybe.

340
00:17:47,364 --> 00:17:49,064
Oh, you are a dirty dog.

341
00:17:50,662 --> 00:17:52,462
I like your style, Runkle.

342
00:17:55,031 --> 00:17:56,978
Can I ask you a question, Sue?

343
00:17:57,103 --> 00:17:58,259
The answer's yes.

344
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,245
I would love a face-ride.

345
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:02,314
Seriously,

346
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:06,111
do women ever fantasize

347
00:18:06,871 --> 00:18:07,771
about...

348
00:18:08,678 --> 00:18:09,629
being raped?

349
00:18:11,219 --> 00:18:12,803
Are you trying to get me wet?

350
00:18:12,928 --> 00:18:14,095
I don't think so.

351
00:18:15,892 --> 00:18:18,251
Women fantasize about rape.

352
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,448
Really?

353
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,853
And my own features

354
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:24,648
a handsome stranger.

355
00:18:25,617 --> 00:18:27,104
Think Jack,

356
00:18:27,452 --> 00:18:30,720
circa "the postman
always rings twice,"

357
00:18:31,181 --> 00:18:32,569
sneaking into my bedroom

358
00:18:32,994 --> 00:18:34,738
and taking me in my sleep.

359
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,656
He pulls down my panties.

360
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,037
He enters slowly.

361
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:41,911
Slips right in.
Oh, jack.

362
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,165
The pussy never lies.
Remember that, Runkle.

363
00:18:45,576 --> 00:18:47,417
I kick, I scream, but it's too late.

364
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:50,995
I mean, the juices are flowing.
The train has left the station.

365
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,018
We are headed for a big,
fat, rocky orgasm.

366
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,094
Sweet jesus, guide me.

367
00:19:04,704 --> 00:19:07,031
Are you trying
to tell me something, Runkle?

368
00:19:07,156 --> 00:19:09,756
Are you thinking
about some role playing?

369
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:13,109
Because you name the game,
I'll play the part.

370
00:19:13,703 --> 00:19:14,861
And I'm good at it.

371
00:19:15,245 --> 00:19:17,500
I used to run lines
with margot kidder.

372
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,057
Before she went apeshit.

373
00:19:19,874 --> 00:19:21,201
Try me sometime.

374
00:19:32,601 --> 00:19:34,631
Look who's here.
What's up, asshole?

375
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,936
That's no way to address
your teacher, young lady.

376
00:19:37,061 --> 00:19:38,743
Is that what you are?
A teacher.

377
00:19:38,868 --> 00:19:41,721
I was thinking more like a destroyer
of hopes and dreams.

378
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,142
Is he gonna be okay?

379
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:45,271
Maybe if you put
your fuckin' cigarette out.

380
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:47,393
He's fine.

381
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,480
He got depressed and he drank
all the cold medicine he could find.

382
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,448
He's such a fuckin' queen.

383
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:58,404
You came.

384
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,198
'Course I did, buddy.

385
00:20:00,694 --> 00:20:01,659
How you doing?

386
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,785
I hate myself,
and I want to fucking die.

387
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:06,653
- Been there.
- I doubt it.

388
00:20:06,778 --> 00:20:09,332
What could you possibly know
about being a fucked-up gay kid?

389
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,308
We're all... gay.

390
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:14,434
In... In some form or another.

391
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,564
We've all had a gay experience

392
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,051
in our past... or two.

393
00:20:20,437 --> 00:20:21,219
You too?

394
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,262
Hells yeah.

395
00:20:22,843 --> 00:20:24,193
Tell me about it.

396
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:29,745
When I was a...

397
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,479
When I was a kid,

398
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:34,691
barely a teenager,

399
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,485
my best friend and I, Mike Metz,

400
00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:40,489
we would...
We'd get undressed...

401
00:20:43,699 --> 00:20:44,742
Don't stop.

402
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:52,679
You know, we would...
We would lay in bed together...

403
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:53,853
naked...

404
00:20:54,811 --> 00:20:57,185
touching each other's...

405
00:20:58,756 --> 00:21:00,133
naked bodies.

406
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,343
You know, just...
And it wasn't, like...

407
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,888
sexual or gay,

408
00:21:05,227 --> 00:21:06,777
but just more of a...

409
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:10,728
more of an expression
of our profound friendship.

410
00:21:12,827 --> 00:21:14,227
See, I don't know.

411
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:17,275
It sounds pretty fucking gay to me.

412
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:19,166
It does sound gay.

413
00:21:21,478 --> 00:21:22,678
You know what?

414
00:21:22,925 --> 00:21:24,574
I'm sorry if I bummed you out.

415
00:21:25,362 --> 00:21:28,585
But you got to cut me some slack here.
I'm pretty new to this teaching thing.

416
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,703
I don't know
what the fuck I'm doing.

417
00:21:32,428 --> 00:21:36,126
You know what I dug about your story?
There was one line I loved.

418
00:21:36,445 --> 00:21:38,171
"The twilight of his eternal youth."

419
00:21:38,658 --> 00:21:40,908
Really dug that.
Stuck in my head.

420
00:21:41,378 --> 00:21:43,343
I polished that one
for a while, actually.

421
00:21:44,617 --> 00:21:45,617
Polish it.

422
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:50,433
I gotta get to work. You think
you could stay with him for a bit?

423
00:21:51,952 --> 00:21:55,429
No, I have... I got to...
I got to run too, so...

424
00:21:58,771 --> 00:21:59,871
Yeah, I can.

425
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,528
No. You know what you can do for me?

426
00:22:02,787 --> 00:22:03,537
What?

427
00:22:04,717 --> 00:22:06,017
Give her a ride.

428
00:22:06,503 --> 00:22:09,744
She took the bus all the way here.
God knows she's too hot for that.

429
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,150
I wouldn't want her
getting raped on my account.

430
00:22:12,275 --> 00:22:14,253
That would be most unfortunate.

431
00:22:14,378 --> 00:22:17,084
Come with me.
My rape-proof chariot awaits.

432
00:22:17,209 --> 00:22:19,545
Later, pale skin.
I hope you feel better.

433
00:22:19,974 --> 00:22:21,274
Keep scribbling.

434
00:22:21,623 --> 00:22:23,007
No kiss goodnight?

435
00:22:26,632 --> 00:22:27,682
Bye, honey.

436
00:23:41,614 --> 00:23:44,536
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What does it look like i'm doing?

437
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:47,925
- I'm raping you.
- Get off me, you fucking asshole!

438
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,674
- Do you love it?
- No! Stop it now!

439
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,599
Because I love it.
This is so not consensual.

440
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,360
What are you thinking?

441
00:24:06,892 --> 00:24:08,905
I thought it was something
you might enjoy.

442
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:11,182
Maybe in the middle you'd be like,

443
00:24:11,307 --> 00:24:13,076
"God, I really do love
this schmuck."

444
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:15,284
You thought
that in the middle of raping me

445
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:17,038
I'd realize how much I love you?

446
00:24:18,008 --> 00:24:19,165
Something like that.

447
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,135
But it sounded
a lot better the way I said it.

448
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,923
And, just to be fair, you know,
it was a rape fantasy.

449
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:28,633
For you, maybe.

450
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,722
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.
My bad.

451
00:24:39,234 --> 00:24:40,520
Sorry. These are yours.

452
00:24:55,254 --> 00:24:56,904
This is where you work?

453
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:01,457
But you just work the front desk
or you're the cashier, right?

454
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,417
Something like that.

455
00:25:03,826 --> 00:25:04,794
Interesting.

456
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,755
You want to come inside?
Maybe wet your whistle?

457
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,953
Would that involve seeing you naked?

458
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,192
- Most definitely.
- Then, no offense, but I think not.

459
00:25:13,317 --> 00:25:15,360
In the interest
of student-teacher relations.

460
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,057
Look at you
with the moral rectitude.

461
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,996
- I'm impressed.
- I know. Me too.

462
00:25:20,737 --> 00:25:22,562
- Thanks for the ride, prof.
- Any time.

463
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,440
You know, not... Not anytime.
This isn't the best habit to get into.

464
00:25:26,565 --> 00:25:27,608
You were right?

465
00:25:27,932 --> 00:25:29,263
He's a shitty writer.

466
00:25:29,897 --> 00:25:31,520
Someone had to tell him.

467
00:25:31,645 --> 00:25:34,490
Parents tell their kids they can be
anything they want when they grow up.

468
00:25:34,845 --> 00:25:37,195
But it's not true.
Not for everyone.

469
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,921
Sometimes that can fuck you up
a lot more

470
00:25:40,046 --> 00:25:42,332
than someone telling you
you can't do a goddamn thing.

471
00:25:43,312 --> 00:25:45,459
Besides, you can't really
teach writing, can you?

472
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:49,922
- You're a smart kid. You know that?
- Damn straight.

473
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:53,676
All right, I got to go shake
my money-makers.

474
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,095
- Have a good night.
- You too.

475
00:25:56,613 --> 00:25:59,806
I hope you get...
lots of singles... I guess.

476
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,046
Or fives, or...

477
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,999
Benjamins? I don't know.

478
00:26:15,757 --> 00:26:18,122
- Where are you going, short stuff?
- Out.

479
00:26:18,247 --> 00:26:19,397
Out, you say?

480
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:21,469
- Out where?
- Just out.

481
00:26:22,001 --> 00:26:24,332
Just out?
I'm not familiar with that area.

482
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,572
The promenade.
I'm meeting Chelsea.

483
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,712
Not so fast.
How you gonna get there?

484
00:26:30,303 --> 00:26:32,489
I don't know.
I'll walk or take the bus.

485
00:26:32,614 --> 00:26:34,123
Did you even think to ask?

486
00:26:34,565 --> 00:26:37,786
- I didn't think you'd care.
- Sorry, honey. Looks like I do.

487
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:40,181
Good to know.
So can I go?

488
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,912
Why don't you stay in with me tonight?
You know, we'll... We'll watch a movie.

489
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:46,237
Pop some corn.

490
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,045
The promenade will always be there.
Unfortunately.

491
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:52,443
Sounds like a good time,
but I think I'd rather go out.

492
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,570
I think I'd rather
have you stay home.

493
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,127
- How 'bout that?
- Got it. Loud and clear.

494
00:26:57,968 --> 00:26:59,992
- So can I go?
- Asked and answered, Becca.

495
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:02,165
- Why?
- Because I said so.

496
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,046
Because you said so?

497
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:06,171
- Because I said so.
- Jesus.

498
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:09,521
- Who are you texting?
- Chelsea.

499
00:27:09,646 --> 00:27:11,545
To tell her you're being
a total dick now.

500
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,674
What is going on with you?
When did you become such a little snot?

501
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:16,884
That is not funny.

502
00:27:17,587 --> 00:27:18,937
It's funny to me.

503
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:26,686
I fucking hate you!

504
00:27:27,087 --> 00:27:30,137
Yeah, and I fuckin' hate you too,
you little shit.
