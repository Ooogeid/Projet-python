1
00:00:01,795 --> 00:00:05,463
I love you, I'm gonna spend the rest of
my life annoying the shit out of you.

2
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,841
- Will you marry me?
- You are officially back together?

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,261
- For now. Until we fuck it up.
- Could be any second now.

4
00:00:12,587 --> 00:00:14,347
You gonna shit can
15 years experience

5
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:16,307
'cause a guy messes up one time?

6
00:00:19,607 --> 00:00:20,761
You got fired?

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,440
I've been trying to get
a meeting with Ronny Praeger.

8
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,776
He's like the Spielberg of porn.

9
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:29,070
- I'll see what I can do.
- That is so awesome!

10
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,821
Don't worry.
I will blow you.

11
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,490
We're gonna keep this business.

12
00:00:32,898 --> 00:00:34,491
I'm king of fuck mountain!

13
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:36,243
It's not a memoir.

14
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:38,788
It's a written account
of our sexual relationship.

15
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,623
Written by me as a fucking novel.

16
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:44,251
I got this book deal.

17
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,855
Wanna write about why everything
I touch turns to gold.

18
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,883
You didn't!

19
00:00:55,238 --> 00:00:57,306
- Where you headed?
- I'm taking <i>Fucking and Punching</i>

20
00:00:57,431 --> 00:00:59,100
all over this fair country of ours.

21
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:02,019
- Mothers, lock up your sons.
- And husbands.

22
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:05,856
We made a huge mistake.

23
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:07,559
I jumped in the car with you,

24
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:10,229
and we just tried to pick up
where we left off.

25
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:11,897
I can't stay.

26
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:14,733
It's OK, dad.
It was nice while it lasted.

27
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,993
I wanna get a divorce.
I'm gonna be with Daisy.

28
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,286
You fucked my man.

29
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,417
- We should take a break.
- I just left my wife for you!

30
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,546
You said I could have everything.
Don't worry about it.

31
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:30,582
We'll let my lawyer figure it out.

32
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,717
He's really good.
Later, Runkle.

33
00:01:34,772 --> 00:01:36,303
- That's him.
- Him who?

34
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,347
- What do you want?
- I'm here to see Becca.

35
00:01:38,589 --> 00:01:40,575
I got a job.
It's in New York.

36
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,768
I think you should come.
I can't live without this.

37
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,188
I feel kind of bad
splitting them up right now.

38
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:48,968
Well, then don't.
You go, I stay.

39
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:50,651
It's all about her.

40
00:01:50,974 --> 00:01:52,993
- I wish you hadn't just said all that.
- Why?

41
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:54,989
'Cause it just makes me
love you even more.

42
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:04,212
Calif'Team pour La Fabrique.

43
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:22,016
Present.

44
00:02:23,345 --> 00:02:25,236
- Did you just...
- No.

45
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:26,824
- You did!
- Not me.

46
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:27,949
I did not.

47
00:02:31,513 --> 00:02:32,735
Maybe for a second.

48
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:35,196
- Jesus Christ!
- No, don't be cross.

49
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:37,449
- You fell asleep.
- I dozed.

50
00:02:38,089 --> 00:02:39,455
- Barely.
- Inside of me.

51
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,779
Maybe. For a second.

52
00:02:40,904 --> 00:02:43,204
Now, it does not
reflect poorly on you.

53
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:46,459
Or your vagina.
It's a lovely vagina.

54
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:49,278
It's warm and cozy...
inviting,

55
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,359
capacious, yet accommodating.

56
00:02:51,484 --> 00:02:53,799
It's cheeky but not impudent,
you know what I'm saying?

57
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:56,168
It's a lovely place
to curl up inside.

58
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:57,575
And go to sleep.

59
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:01,305
- Great. Where's my fucking clothes?
- Not so fast.

60
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:02,765
I may be tired,

61
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,659
I'm also incredibly hard right now.

62
00:03:06,006 --> 00:03:07,163
You feel that?

63
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,469
I just flexed my cock muscle.
That's pretty cool, huh?

64
00:03:10,684 --> 00:03:13,519
Flexing it again and again
and again.

65
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:16,872
Where's the harm in a few winks?

66
00:03:17,227 --> 00:03:19,892
You know, single dadness
is not as easy as it looks.

67
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,382
I gotta be up way early
to make the morning meal

68
00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:24,203
get the kid to school.
Then I gotta,

69
00:03:24,982 --> 00:03:27,335
come home
and wrestle with the blank page.

70
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,464
Before I know, it's time to get back in
that fucking pickup line all over again.

71
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:34,189
- Ever hear of carpooling?
- And then I gotta...

72
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:37,367
I gotta make some kind of
vaguely healthy evening meal.

73
00:03:37,492 --> 00:03:40,145
I gotta monitor her computer
and texting activity.

74
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,313
It's exhausting.

75
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:43,472
I barely even have time
to get loaded anymore.

76
00:03:48,498 --> 00:03:49,498
Excuse me.

77
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:54,158
- Was that...
- No, you're wrong.

78
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,064
- But...
- You're wrong.

79
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,278
Move on.

80
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,824
I thought you were all about
keeping yourself pure for mom.

81
00:04:01,993 --> 00:04:04,719
She's a friend, you know.
We were doing friend-like stuff.

82
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:06,721
Practically napping.

83
00:04:08,588 --> 00:04:09,738
Good for you.

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,300
I'm not judging.

85
00:04:11,707 --> 00:04:14,877
Mom's certainly not keeping
herself pure for you.

86
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:16,842
What?

87
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:18,924
Nothing. Move on.

88
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:22,845
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be at the movies.

89
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:25,603
- We walked out.
- It was so fucking lame, Hank.

90
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:28,770
Really?

91
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:30,769
It's Mr. Moody to you, little Missy.

92
00:04:31,684 --> 00:04:32,751
Mr. Moody.

93
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:41,879
Wait a second.

94
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:44,248
You guys are stoned!

95
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:46,293
Dad...
please.

96
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:49,421
Where you got the weed?
I will kill the motherfucker. Tell me.

97
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,649
- In your typewriter.
- I knew it!

98
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:55,002
Damn it.

99
00:04:55,741 --> 00:04:56,963
All right. Shit.

100
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:01,383
Gimme what you got. Fork it over.
Everything. I'm gonna weigh that.

101
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:09,718
Hold on, ladies.
I'm not done with you.

102
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:13,854
I am very well aware that
I don't always set the best example,

103
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:16,982
but you're entirely too young
to be messing around with this stuff.

104
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,943
It's true what they say about pot.

105
00:05:19,112 --> 00:05:21,122
<i>It's very much a gateway drug.</i>

106
00:05:22,101 --> 00:05:23,815
And it can be a gateway
to cool things.

107
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,242
But it can lead to poverty, despair,
stunted adolescence, man-breasts, too.

108
00:05:29,757 --> 00:05:31,149
You think that's funny?

109
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:36,999
Go on, get outta here.
Both of you.

110
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:39,170
To be continued, young lady.

111
00:07:06,765 --> 00:07:08,391
What up, chocolate sweetness?

112
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,061
Who are you here to see?

113
00:07:10,186 --> 00:07:12,124
- Runkle.
- Whose uncle?

114
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:16,911
The cute little bald guy.

115
00:07:17,892 --> 00:07:20,564
Just so's you know, not a pose that
inspires confidence

116
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:21,899
in your only client.

117
00:07:22,653 --> 00:07:24,818
It's this goddamn economy, Hank.

118
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:27,956
You can't blame everything
on the economy, douche bag.

119
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:31,109
Can I blame it for the fact that
no one wants to publish your book?

120
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,145
Nonsense.
People love me.

121
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:35,329
No one, Hank.
Not a soul.

122
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:37,932
- What the fuck, Runkle?
- I don't know.

123
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,748
I been collecting passes
all morning.

124
00:07:39,873 --> 00:07:42,189
It's too long.
It's too self-Indulgent.

125
00:07:42,314 --> 00:07:44,239
It's too hateful, too misogynistic.

126
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,491
It's too soft.
It's too mean-spirited.

127
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:47,955
Like those are bad things?

128
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,896
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this out loud,

129
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:52,202
- but the studios?
- They're not biting either.

130
00:07:52,327 --> 00:07:55,766
Hollywood doesn't want something else
from the unrepentant asshole,

131
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:58,282
That brought you
<i>Crazy Little Thing Called Love</i> one...

132
00:07:58,407 --> 00:07:59,394
and dos?

133
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,916
I told you to play nice,

134
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,958
I told you not to fuck
the director's wife.

135
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:06,902
I told you not to leave
a burning bag of your own feces

136
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,726
- on the producer's doorstep.
- That still cracks me up.

137
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:12,487
That's a big fucking bummer.

138
00:08:12,612 --> 00:08:14,989
I could use an influx
of "cashish" right about now.

139
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:17,138
The money for the Ashby book
only went so far.

140
00:08:17,904 --> 00:08:19,248
Get in line, asshole.

141
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,886
I was looking to the new
Hank Moody book too, you know?

142
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:23,512
He wants to reschedule?

143
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:27,146
Tell him I'll gnaw off his dick
and feed it to my cats!

144
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:30,869
Runkle, quit beating your meat.

145
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,700
Never gets old, Sue.

146
00:08:33,795 --> 00:08:35,921
Hank Moody, my boss, Sue Collini.

147
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,101
Pleasure to have you
at the Harry Greenberg agency, Hank.

148
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,880
The pleasure is all mine.
Obviously.

149
00:08:42,358 --> 00:08:43,766
Your man Runkle...

150
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:46,668
Now when you talk about
a cock of the walk.

151
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:47,846
Really?

152
00:08:47,971 --> 00:08:50,509
I mean, this guy's a stud.
And his head...

153
00:08:51,803 --> 00:08:54,950
It just makes you wanna give it
a lick and see what comes out of it.

154
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,770
- Please don't.
- Of course not.

155
00:08:56,895 --> 00:08:58,695
It would be inappropriate.

156
00:09:01,228 --> 00:09:02,862
Meet me for a drink later.

157
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,712
Actually, I'm supposed
to do something with Hank here.

158
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:11,048
- I don't think we have any plans.
- I think we do.

159
00:09:12,574 --> 00:09:14,092
I'm pretty sure we don't.

160
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,764
Excellent.
I'm all yours, Sue.

161
00:09:19,147 --> 00:09:21,550
Better lay down those carbs, Runkle.

162
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,305
We're goin' deep.

163
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:25,564
Collini... out.

164
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:29,051
What fresh hell is this?

165
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,234
It's Rip Van Winkle.

166
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,619
We should give it another shot.

167
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,360
You know, I took a nap.
I'm fresh as a fucking Daisy.

168
00:09:41,485 --> 00:09:43,624
- Becca's dad, right?
- Yikes.

169
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:46,335
It depends on what she's done
to raise your ire.

170
00:09:46,814 --> 00:09:48,497
Becca? No, Becca's adorable.

171
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:50,339
It's her father I've an issue with.

172
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,611
Well, take a number and get in line.

173
00:09:52,736 --> 00:09:55,135
I'll tell him you're waiting.
If I see him, of course.

174
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,503
Felicia Koons.

175
00:09:56,947 --> 00:09:58,614
- Chelsea's mom?
- Oh, boy.

176
00:09:59,652 --> 00:10:01,409
Howdy.
Hank Moody.

177
00:10:01,742 --> 00:10:03,477
So I guess I was wondering

178
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,646
why my daughter
came home stoned last night.

179
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:07,098
Are you sure?

180
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:09,650
I know a stoned teenager
when I see one.

181
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,462
I'm a college professor.

182
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:13,695
I guess the jig is up.

183
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:16,024
You know, far be it for me
to pass judgment

184
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,426
on your...
recreational activities,

185
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,413
But maybe you should make your dope
a little less accessible?

186
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:24,330
I mean, what else
do I have to worry about?

187
00:10:24,455 --> 00:10:26,041
Guns in the house too?

188
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,419
Yes, but I keep 'em in the freezer.
Right next to the heroin.

189
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:34,339
You're absolutely right.
I fucked up. I won't do it again.

190
00:10:34,464 --> 00:10:37,719
I get it. That's just for
my glaucoma anyway, you know?

191
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:40,347
Speak of the she-devils.

192
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:42,908
- Can I go over to Chelsea's?
- Well...

193
00:10:43,428 --> 00:10:44,875
That would depend on Chelsea

194
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,396
and her lovely, far-too-young
to be a mother here.

195
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,624
Sure. Why not?

196
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:52,942
Pick her up later.
Actually, stay for dinner.

197
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:56,302
- We're having some people over.
- I don't play well with others.

198
00:10:56,427 --> 00:10:59,157
- It wouldn't turn out well for anybody.
- It's true,

199
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,417
he doesn't.

200
00:11:00,542 --> 00:11:03,787
If we're going to be bailing these two
out of jail every now and again,

201
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,241
we may as well get to know
each other a little better.

202
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,750
So be there.
Keep the weed at home.

203
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:10,901
Sure thing, teach.

204
00:11:15,826 --> 00:11:18,897
And that brings us
to the issue of the house.

205
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:21,625
I just want my fair share.

206
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,866
It's been sitting on the market
for months now, Charlie.

207
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:26,518
It's not selling.

208
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,396
Maybe if you weren't too busy
bringing every unemployed actor in LA.

209
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:33,150
with a cougar fetish back to my house,
you could focus on getting it sold.

210
00:11:33,969 --> 00:11:36,354
First...
it's our house.

211
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:38,807
And second, if you weren't too busy

212
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,623
trying to shove your angry inch
into every damage case

213
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:42,993
that crosses your path,

214
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:45,370
we wouldn't even be in this mess
to begin with.

215
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,232
Can I get a fucking amen?

216
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:51,035
Look, all I'm saying is

217
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,463
I can't afford to keep paying rent
and mortgage at the same time.

218
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:56,575
He's hiding money somewhere.
I know it!

219
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,250
There's nothing to hide!

220
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:00,283
She snorted it all.

221
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:03,973
- You're working as an agent again!
- I'm working on commission!

222
00:12:04,746 --> 00:12:05,746
Really?

223
00:12:06,177 --> 00:12:08,319
- That's pathetic, Charlie.
- Agreed.

224
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:10,979
It's the only way
I could get back in the business.

225
00:12:11,803 --> 00:12:14,483
It's not like the top five are
rolling out the red carpet for me.

226
00:12:15,606 --> 00:12:17,613
I wonder why.
Oh, That's right.

227
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,022
They're probably afraid
you'd jerk off all over it.

228
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,292
You know what? Have it your way.
I'll move back in.

229
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,111
- Hells no!
- What, you said so yourself.

230
00:12:29,236 --> 00:12:30,404
It's our house.

231
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:32,328
My name's on the mortgage too.

232
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,353
That can't be right.
Tell him, Marv!

233
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:37,401
What can I say?

234
00:12:37,612 --> 00:12:40,300
It's perfectly within his rights.

235
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,479
Finally!
I win!

236
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,908
I know you're environmentalist
but you don't have to be an asshole.

237
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:15,613
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

238
00:13:15,738 --> 00:13:17,379
That's right.
Fuck you!

239
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,852
Livestrong, asshole.

240
00:13:45,685 --> 00:13:48,810
- This is Richard bates, the writer.
- Richard bates.

241
00:13:48,935 --> 00:13:52,711
He's going to be teaching here
this year. It's a huge <i>coup</i> for us.

242
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,334
Big fan. I just feel a slight
man crush coming on.

243
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,209
Thank you, aren't you kind?

244
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:59,389
- This is my T.A.
- Jill Robinson.

245
00:13:59,514 --> 00:14:01,840
- Nice to meet ya.
- Jill, the pleasure is all yours.

246
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,460
Or mine.

247
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:04,995
OK, ours.

248
00:14:06,618 --> 00:14:09,633
Hank is quite the accomplished
novelist in his own right.

249
00:14:09,908 --> 00:14:13,185
- That's right. I googled you.
- I feel pleasantly violated.

250
00:14:14,117 --> 00:14:17,008
So you were just gonna...
show me to the little girl's room.

251
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,922
Sure thing. Follow me.

252
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,110
- Tinkle, tinkle.
- Right this way.

253
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,362
Drink with me. I insist.

254
00:14:24,202 --> 00:14:26,189
- No, thank you.
- No, please.

255
00:14:26,314 --> 00:14:27,360
No, I'm fine.

256
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,145
<i>Crack the Sky</i> was a big deal for me.

257
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,412
I felt like I was climbing
Kilimanjaro with you.

258
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,080
Gave me a huge writing boner.

259
00:14:34,712 --> 00:14:35,712
Please?

260
00:14:36,444 --> 00:14:37,542
Pretty please?

261
00:14:43,141 --> 00:14:44,452
To the blank page.

262
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:04,203
- That was something.
- It sure was.

263
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,697
Haven't touched the stuff since
slick willy was in the white house.

264
00:15:08,368 --> 00:15:09,980
- Fuck me.
- Yes.

265
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,736
- Pour me another.
- No. The bar just closed.

266
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:14,788
One was an honor,
but I'm cutting you off.

267
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:17,733
Give me the fucking bottle,
bush league, before they come back.

268
00:15:18,257 --> 00:15:20,085
- Give me the bottle.
- No. No.

269
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:22,421
Come here!

270
00:15:22,984 --> 00:15:24,089
That's my balls.

271
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,343
- Thank you.
- Don't say anything.

272
00:15:30,653 --> 00:15:31,953
Oh, my goodness.

273
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,491
Whose piece of shit Porsche is that?

274
00:15:34,616 --> 00:15:36,894
- Stacy, what happened?
- You wouldn't believe it.

275
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,671
- Some fucking asshole...
- Well, you know...

276
00:15:39,796 --> 00:15:41,834
it's actually kind of a classic.

277
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,318
Stacy, this is Becca's father.
Hank Moody, the writer.

278
00:15:45,756 --> 00:15:49,065
Stacy, I do believe I can see
the outline of your cock.

279
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,685
It looks like you've got yourself
A nice, big fire helmet down there.

280
00:15:53,023 --> 00:15:55,021
I'm more of an anteater myself.

281
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:57,209
Enhances sensitivity.

282
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,781
Shall we dine?

283
00:16:06,729 --> 00:16:08,215
Times are tough, Runkle.

284
00:16:08,563 --> 00:16:12,098
I need you to sign motherfuckers
and put them to work.

285
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,342
That's what I want.
That's what you promised me.

286
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,700
Absolutely. You're right, Sue.
You can count on me.

287
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,883
I stepped away from the game
for a little while, but I am back now.

288
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:24,150
- I'm just a little rusty.
- Rusty.

289
00:16:24,434 --> 00:16:25,793
You mean like a trombone?

290
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,767
Anybody ever give you one of those?

291
00:16:27,892 --> 00:16:30,380
- I... don't believe so.
- Trust me.

292
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,107
You'd remember.

293
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,652
Analingus... with a tug job.

294
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:37,078
Ought to try it.

295
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:41,374
- What's your favorite position?
- Sexually?

296
00:16:42,661 --> 00:16:45,049
I don't see how
that's at all relevant

297
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:48,127
I like a... stand up 69.
You ever try it?

298
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,394
- That sounds... challenging.
- Exactly!

299
00:16:51,757 --> 00:16:54,394
Which is why you end up
coming like a baby gorilla.

300
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,391
So what's your take on
interoffice romance?

301
00:17:00,547 --> 00:17:03,772
I appreciate the interest, Sue.
Really, I do.

302
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:06,524
But I am right in the middle
of a nasty divorce.

303
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:09,482
I'm what they call
emotionally unavailable.

304
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,288
Emotions?

305
00:17:11,734 --> 00:17:13,184
Who needs emotions?

306
00:17:13,646 --> 00:17:15,283
I'm thinking about your tube steak.

307
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,285
Is that unavailable too?

308
00:17:19,527 --> 00:17:21,713
You can play hard to get
all you like, Runkle.

309
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:23,488
Whatever makes you wet.

310
00:17:24,005 --> 00:17:27,020
But Sue Collini
always gets the wienie.

311
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,650
Always.

312
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,160
Bottoms up, cowboy.

313
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,145
Right of way or not,
you were definitely hogging the road.

314
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:37,139
You flicked your cigarette at me.

315
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,724
Sure. But you gave me the finger.
That got my irish up.

316
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,493
That was downright
antisocial of you.

317
00:17:41,618 --> 00:17:43,671
Yes. But you were honking
your horn repeatedly.

318
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,557
Which brings us back full circle to
the fact that you were hogging the road.

319
00:17:46,682 --> 00:17:48,817
- I'm sayin'...
- I had the right of way.

320
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,352
- Who says?
- California.

321
00:17:50,477 --> 00:17:52,046
- I don't agree.
- He disagree.

322
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,572
- I don't agree.
- Can we just change the subject?

323
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,498
I'm fine with that.
I mean, I've already moved on.

324
00:17:57,623 --> 00:17:59,578
And I won't hold any grudges.
I'm cool.

325
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:03,003
- Hate the game... not the playah.
- I'll drink to that.

326
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,333
Unbelievable.

327
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,224
Can we be excused?

328
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,382
Please. I insist.

329
00:18:11,261 --> 00:18:14,099
Ladies, no Mary Jane.
I'm serious. Try me.

330
00:18:14,224 --> 00:18:16,594
I'm like a drug-sniffing dog
with a hard-on for justice.

331
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:19,545
- Yeah. Hey...
- Father.

332
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:22,571
- Now get outta here.
- Jesus.

333
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,813
I'll throw this out to the table.

334
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,463
What are you guys thinking,
gay, bi-curious?

335
00:18:27,588 --> 00:18:28,588
What?

336
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:31,708
What is wrong with you?

337
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:35,488
What? I'm the asshole just 'cause
I say what's on everybody's mind?

338
00:18:35,832 --> 00:18:38,408
- It never occurred to me.
- Actually, me neither.

339
00:18:38,965 --> 00:18:41,365
I can't really say I see it myself.

340
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,996
Little girls...

341
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:44,838
in pretty boxes.

342
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,871
I'm not afraid
to put it out there, you know?

343
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,409
And if my daughter
decides she's a gay,

344
00:18:52,534 --> 00:18:54,484
I cannot think of a nicer gal

345
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:57,235
that she can, you know, indulge
her sapphic tendencies with.

346
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,344
That's vaguely sweet, I think.

347
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:01,426
Yes. Vaguely nauseating.

348
00:19:01,834 --> 00:19:03,628
Where is the boom-boom room?

349
00:19:03,753 --> 00:19:06,092
It's just down the hall,
Richard, to your left.

350
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,582
Good squash.

351
00:19:10,707 --> 00:19:13,507
Ten years sobriety, down the drain.
Nice job.

352
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,474
How is he gonna get up
in front of a class?

353
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:19,199
- Well, you know what they say.
- No, what do they say, Hank?

354
00:19:19,996 --> 00:19:21,769
You really have to want to quit.

355
00:19:22,055 --> 00:19:23,182
You gotta...

356
00:19:23,307 --> 00:19:24,579
hit rock bottom.

357
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,440
Can I have a word with you, dear?

358
00:19:27,914 --> 00:19:29,217
Sure, darling.

359
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,823
What's your story, morning glory?

360
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:42,916
- I'm... 33.
- Perfect.

361
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,009
I'm getting my PhD on...

362
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:47,848
- Perfect.
- English lit. I love to read.

363
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,455
That's my drug of choice,
the written word.

364
00:19:51,561 --> 00:19:52,471
And...

365
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:56,721
I ended a five-year relationship
that yielded me a big, fat nothing.

366
00:19:56,846 --> 00:19:59,899
Not to make it sound like
a cold, hard business deal, but...

367
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,640
Whatever.

368
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:05,196
And my 20s went by
like a warm summer day,

369
00:20:05,321 --> 00:20:08,435
and now my uterus is
deteriorating with every breath.

370
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,141
So, I see it all.

371
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:12,766
You're handsome
and you're funny and...

372
00:20:13,604 --> 00:20:15,947
really, unless
you're a serious prospect,

373
00:20:16,072 --> 00:20:18,122
do not so much as smile at me.

374
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,385
Really, truly.
Don't try to charm me.

375
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,393
It would just be a heinous crime

376
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:25,568
against the other sex,
given this full disclosure.

377
00:20:26,988 --> 00:20:28,510
And... I'm hard.

378
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,254
Please, seriously.
You're really dangerous.

379
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:34,865
Please stay away.

380
00:20:38,157 --> 00:20:39,904
Let's try again, shall we?

381
00:20:41,127 --> 00:20:42,782
That's mighty white of you, Stace.

382
00:20:45,297 --> 00:20:46,447
Koons, right?

383
00:20:47,582 --> 00:20:48,697
That's right.

384
00:20:50,657 --> 00:20:53,793
You're the dean of this fine institute
of fancy book learning?

385
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,837
- Correct.
- Which would make you...

386
00:20:57,042 --> 00:20:59,750
- Dean Koons?
- I've heard that one before.

387
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,969
Who wants to see me tuck
and do the pee-pee dance?

388
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,554
Oh, my god.

389
00:21:06,607 --> 00:21:08,179
Come on. I can't be the only one.

390
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:10,700
- Where are the girls?
- Just like that...

391
00:21:12,381 --> 00:21:13,832
he unveiled

392
00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:16,357
his beautiful man-pussy.

393
00:21:16,914 --> 00:21:18,164
His glorious...

394
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:19,920
mangina.

395
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:25,294
<i>Meet my peach, baby.</i>

396
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:27,562
<i>Blow on my dice.</i>

397
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:30,598
<i>I wanna swing that swing.</i>

398
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:32,874
<i>Don't you treat me nice.</i>

399
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,558
- Richard, let me...
- <i>I'm wild for you.</i>

400
00:21:35,683 --> 00:21:38,367
- Let me call you a cab.
- <i>Sweet baby,</i>

401
00:21:38,492 --> 00:21:40,965
<i>I'm a child for you.</i>

402
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,343
Richard, why don't you stay
in the guest room?

403
00:21:45,617 --> 00:21:47,763
Have you ever spent time
with an 11-year-old boy

404
00:21:47,888 --> 00:21:50,099
and wanted more from him
than he was willing to give?

405
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:53,171
Have you ever breathed in the scent

406
00:21:53,296 --> 00:21:56,272
of a woman's sweaty,
unwashed sex and just...

407
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,525
wanted to bottle
and sell it at market?

408
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,822
Have you ever been so drunk on cock

409
00:22:05,247 --> 00:22:08,785
you howled at the moon and begged
for a few inches more?

410
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:11,955
Ladies?
Dean Koons?

411
00:22:12,525 --> 00:22:15,325
All these questions and more
will be answered

412
00:22:15,984 --> 00:22:17,414
in my new novel.

413
00:22:19,188 --> 00:22:21,169
- Let's get you dressed.
- First...

414
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,643
I wanna go for a swim!

415
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,898
Love that guy.

416
00:22:31,442 --> 00:22:32,446
Big fan.

417
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:34,936
Big dick.

418
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,894
What do you want, Charlie?
I'm watching my stories.

419
00:22:48,019 --> 00:22:49,935
Marcy Ellen Runkle.

420
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,203
I love you.

421
00:22:53,727 --> 00:22:56,901
Go home, you miserable sack of shit.
Sleep it off!

422
00:22:57,244 --> 00:22:58,998
But this is my home!

423
00:22:59,123 --> 00:23:01,853
This! And you know why?

424
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:04,966
Because Marcy lives here.

425
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,355
She's my home.

426
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,237
- My true west.
- North.

427
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,425
- What?
- True north.

428
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,607
- That's what they say.
- Who?

429
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,479
What?

430
00:23:22,959 --> 00:23:24,730
Let's give it another shot?

431
00:23:25,323 --> 00:23:26,623
What do you say?

432
00:23:29,362 --> 00:23:30,462
Fair enough.

433
00:23:32,088 --> 00:23:33,411
Can I use the bathroom?

434
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:36,464
I have to go numero dos,

435
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:39,167
and I don't know if I'm gonna make it
back to Westwood in time.

436
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:41,971
Make it quick, asshole.

437
00:23:43,784 --> 00:23:45,828
You sure Becca's OK
to spend the night?

438
00:23:46,435 --> 00:23:48,801
Let her sleep.
I'll drop her off in the morning.

439
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,095
But you'll keep an eye on them?

440
00:23:52,017 --> 00:23:54,725
Right. For signs of lesbianism.
Yeah. Will do.

441
00:23:55,263 --> 00:23:56,613
I'll be vigilant.

442
00:23:57,882 --> 00:24:01,248
Sorry about the drama tonight.
You must think I'm a world-class a-hole.

443
00:24:01,743 --> 00:24:03,893
Don't know about the world-class.

444
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,588
Well, thank you. What about Bates?

445
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:08,577
Is he gonna be able to do his thing?

446
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,748
From rehab? I doubt it.

447
00:24:12,263 --> 00:24:15,429
You wouldn't happen to know
of any other bad-boy novelists

448
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,659
looking for a teaching gig,
would you?

449
00:24:19,111 --> 00:24:22,179
I don't know. I will bring it up
at the next union meeting.

450
00:24:22,592 --> 00:24:23,711
Good night.

451
00:24:23,991 --> 00:24:24,991
Night.

452
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:30,428
Where ya headed?

453
00:24:32,592 --> 00:24:33,930
Just home to the cats.

454
00:24:34,715 --> 00:24:35,765
Sounds hot.

455
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,519
How'bout a libation?

456
00:24:40,592 --> 00:24:42,847
Like that could possibly end well.

457
00:24:42,972 --> 00:24:45,099
Look at you
with the foresight and all.

458
00:24:45,224 --> 00:24:47,228
- Well played, lady.
- Thanks.

459
00:24:47,682 --> 00:24:49,097
Good night, Mr. Moody.

460
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:51,114
That's was a pleasure meeting you.

461
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:52,666
Good night, psycho...

462
00:24:53,157 --> 00:24:54,784
Take good care of that uterus.

463
00:25:09,707 --> 00:25:12,626
Oh, my god, Charlie.
What are you doing in there?

464
00:25:12,925 --> 00:25:14,225
It's my I-B-S!

465
00:25:14,669 --> 00:25:17,695
You know how it kicks in
in times of extreme duress.

466
00:25:18,011 --> 00:25:19,898
Well, this is one of those times!

467
00:25:32,206 --> 00:25:34,277
All right. It's all right.

468
00:25:36,296 --> 00:25:37,983
Miserable slob.

469
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,606
Guest room. Go.

470
00:25:48,178 --> 00:25:49,665
What up, lady fair?

471
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,692
<i> Hank, it's late.</i>

472
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:54,218
And yet you don't sound
even remotely sleepy.

473
00:25:54,498 --> 00:25:57,413
<i>- Burning the midnight oil?</i>
- Something like that.

474
00:25:57,946 --> 00:25:59,876
I get it. Big date?

475
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,268
I'm not sure how big it was.

476
00:26:02,652 --> 00:26:03,477
Gross.

477
00:26:05,656 --> 00:26:07,773
Bad breath. H-O-B.

478
00:26:08,949 --> 00:26:10,995
- H-O-B?
<i>- Hair on back.</i>

479
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,446
Well, now I'm starting
to feel better.

480
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:16,909
- What about you?
- What about me?

481
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:19,772
Our monkey in the middle
said something about

482
00:26:20,637 --> 00:26:22,741
Crossing paths
with a friend of yours.

483
00:26:23,662 --> 00:26:26,122
- She's a little meddler, that one.
<i>- That she is.</i>

484
00:26:27,814 --> 00:26:28,929
Not to worry.

485
00:26:29,951 --> 00:26:31,387
Bad breath. H-O-B.

486
00:26:34,872 --> 00:26:35,793
I miss you.

487
00:26:36,877 --> 00:26:37,957
I miss you too.

488
00:26:38,726 --> 00:26:40,787
It ain't the same without you,
you know.

489
00:26:42,743 --> 00:26:44,309
That's nice to hear.

490
00:26:46,155 --> 00:26:47,730
I think it's good, though.

491
00:26:48,531 --> 00:26:49,545
What's good?

492
00:26:49,848 --> 00:26:53,817
<i>We're... living our lives.</i>
<i>We're being all normal</i>

493
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,478
and responsible and...

494
00:26:56,356 --> 00:26:58,106
like real, live grownups.

495
00:26:59,302 --> 00:27:00,639
Well, I do feel...

496
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,596
vaguely functional these days.
You know,

497
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:07,784
- You might even be proud of me.
- I'm always proud of you.

498
00:27:09,344 --> 00:27:10,744
Even when I'm not.

499
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:16,939
That's nice to hear.

500
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,420
- But...
<i>- But what?</i>

501
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:24,839
What if, in the process of being...

502
00:27:25,617 --> 00:27:28,920
Well, responsible
and grown-up like, we...

503
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,260
just kinda get over each other?

504
00:27:37,185 --> 00:27:38,242
What if...

505
00:27:38,737 --> 00:27:40,837
you tell me about our daughter.

506
00:27:44,355 --> 00:27:47,206
Well...
things are changing, Karen,

507
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,984
<i>just like you said they would.</i>

508
00:27:49,109 --> 00:27:51,059
I mean, fast, you know, but I'm...

509
00:27:51,652 --> 00:27:53,435
I'm holding on as hard as I can,

510
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,360
And I am not gonna let go.

511
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,397
I mean, I...
I won't forget you.
