1
00:00:00,163 --> 00:00:03,089
- <i>Previously on</i> Californication...
- That's it! Bigs, stop the van!

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,730
- What?
- Ovitz! Hit the bricks!

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,761
See you at the oscars, pal.

4
00:00:07,922 --> 00:00:09,471
He ruined my career.

5
00:00:09,632 --> 00:00:12,605
Daisy's family, and you
fucked her shit up. Fix this.

6
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:15,894
<i>Vaginatown</i> is probably not gonna
happen. The financing fell through.

7
00:00:16,055 --> 00:00:17,812
- You're shitting me!
- I wish I was.

8
00:00:17,973 --> 00:00:20,875
The "Wall of Cocks" sequence alone
would have blown people's minds.

9
00:00:20,995 --> 00:00:22,841
The "Wall of Cocks"...

10
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,112
Oh, hells, yeah!
You got Daisy the part.

11
00:00:26,273 --> 00:00:28,197
I had to invest 100 grand
in his movie.

12
00:00:28,358 --> 00:00:30,617
- Yeah. I am pregnant.
- I'm not the father.

13
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:33,161
There was only one guy,
according to Sonja.

14
00:00:33,322 --> 00:00:36,244
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but Hank could very well be

15
00:00:36,364 --> 00:00:38,165
the father of the child.

16
00:00:38,326 --> 00:00:41,097
- What the fuck is this?
- Something to put in your book.

17
00:00:41,217 --> 00:00:44,582
We drove out here together. I ended up
producing. She ended up alone.

18
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:52,097

19
00:01:26,013 --> 00:01:27,027
Hey.

20
00:01:31,423 --> 00:01:32,436
Greetings.

21
00:01:34,016 --> 00:01:36,099
Can you tell me what
you're doing on my property?

22
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,843
Yeah, I'm just...
I wanted to know

23
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:41,487
- if the lady of the house was home.
- And you are?

24
00:01:41,607 --> 00:01:42,855
I'm a friend.

25
00:01:43,058 --> 00:01:45,286
Well, I'm more of a friend
of a friend, actually.

26
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,539
My wife doesn't have any friends
that I don't know.

27
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:48,737
So you're married?

28
00:01:49,627 --> 00:01:52,833
- That's none of your goddamn business.
- I appreciate the hostility.

29
00:01:52,953 --> 00:01:55,032
But I'm not trying
to break into your castle

30
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:56,353
I'm a writer.

31
00:01:56,473 --> 00:01:59,038
I'm doing some research.
My name is Hank Moody. A pleasure.

32
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:00,749
There's no smoking here.

33
00:02:02,263 --> 00:02:03,293
Outside.

34
00:02:03,692 --> 00:02:06,755
- There's no smoking outside? Really?
- Is everything okay out here?

35
00:02:07,616 --> 00:02:09,782
- This is her?
- Honey, it's okay. Go back inside.

36
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,391
My name is Hank Moody. I'm a writer.
I was doing some research.

37
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:16,554
Did I... say
that you could talk to her?

38
00:02:17,126 --> 00:02:20,185
You got a bit of an overprotective vibe
happening here.

39
00:02:20,346 --> 00:02:23,062
I want to ask you a question
about Lew, Lew Ashby.

40
00:02:23,626 --> 00:02:27,185
I asked you nicely
to get off my property.

41
00:02:27,305 --> 00:02:29,201
I don't know about "nicely,"
motherfucker.

42
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:32,153
I will leave your property
when I'm good and ready...

43
00:02:32,273 --> 00:02:33,405
Mothafuckah.

44
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,332
Who puts a fucking bush there?

45
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:27,760
I'm just saying,

46
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,485
Ashby manor might not be
the best place for you

47
00:03:30,605 --> 00:03:32,911
in your current
depressed frame of mind.

48
00:03:33,031 --> 00:03:34,970
It's not the best place
for anybody since

49
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,802
the douche bag within
takes up residence.

50
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:38,638
Your favorite.
You really like him.

51
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,806
Who? Julian Self,
the snake-oil salesman?

52
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:42,934
10 grand a week
that bearded bozo's making,

53
00:03:43,095 --> 00:03:46,512
dispensing his diarrhea-of-the-mouth
therapies to the creatively blocked.

54
00:03:46,682 --> 00:03:48,347
- Can you believe it?
- 10 grand.

55
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:51,985
That's what you should have put
the Runkle nest egg into: self-help.

56
00:03:52,146 --> 00:03:54,946
Wait a min: that's sleazier than porn.
So I think you made the right choice.

57
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:57,256
Laugh it up, pal.
Only one more day of shooting,

58
00:03:57,376 --> 00:03:59,742
we sell this puppy,
and I double my investment.

59
00:03:59,903 --> 00:04:03,095
- So you're sanguine about the whole...
- I'm sanguinissimo, baby.

60
00:04:03,403 --> 00:04:05,347
Although I got to say,
you know what?

61
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:07,666
I'm a little worried
about being on that porn set.

62
00:04:07,786 --> 00:04:10,043
'Cause I'm starting to feel
like a gynecologist.

63
00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:13,047
Yikes. Did you ever think
of that girl?

64
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:16,191
She looks down between the stirrups
and she sees your gleaming orb

65
00:04:16,376 --> 00:04:18,730
looming straight up at her.
You ever think about that?

66
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,263
did I ever think about
penetrating someone with my head?

67
00:04:21,585 --> 00:04:23,765
- No, I never did think about that.
- Good.

68
00:04:43,878 --> 00:04:45,171
Lew, you decent?

69
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:51,877
I knew you were a dick!

70
00:04:53,624 --> 00:04:54,631
I knew it.

71
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:56,415
Can we do this later, please?

72
00:04:56,585 --> 00:04:58,221
Sure, no problem.

73
00:05:01,252 --> 00:05:02,925
Come on.
Let go of it.

74
00:05:03,547 --> 00:05:04,704
You can do it.

75
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:09,978
All right, just smile.

76
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,814
Nice.

77
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,359
Please.

78
00:05:14,835 --> 00:05:15,837
Please.

79
00:05:16,771 --> 00:05:18,414
That's good. We're done.

80
00:05:19,273 --> 00:05:22,032
Nice and secure on there. I'm a little
concerned with the bump here.

81
00:05:22,194 --> 00:05:24,493
If you could just...
I don't want it to fall off.

82
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,039
Geez! For the love of fuck, guys!

83
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,417
Careful! I love this thing.
More than life itself.

84
00:05:32,048 --> 00:05:33,459
Thank you very much.

85
00:05:36,634 --> 00:05:37,838
Baby!

86
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:40,717
What have you done to my house?

87
00:05:40,878 --> 00:05:44,264
I'm sorry, okay?
It's just... the location fell through.

88
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:47,988
So, look, we have one more scene,
And <i>Vaginatown</i> is a wrap, okay?

89
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,228
I figured you'd be working.

90
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:53,338
What, a girl can't come home
a little early?

91
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:56,034
Knock off, relax,
watch a little <i>Opes</i>?

92
00:05:56,154 --> 00:05:57,109
Runkle!

93
00:05:57,271 --> 00:05:59,278
I'm gonna need to knock
a couple walls.

94
00:05:59,544 --> 00:06:01,255
What is he talking about?

95
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,949
What's that? Is it the spinner?

96
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,034
Didn't we shoot that scene already?

97
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,305
This is my wife.

98
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,240
Sorry.

99
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,709
Ronny Praeger.
Filmmaker.

100
00:06:13,294 --> 00:06:16,362
You never told me your old dear
was such a lovely bit of filth.

101
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,299
You dirty bastard. What do you reckon,
sweetheart? Do you wanna be in it?

102
00:06:20,486 --> 00:06:24,053
I could easily see you and Daisy engaged
in a nice little bit of stand-up 69.

103
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:28,265
69 is a waste of time,
stand-up or otherwise.

104
00:06:28,547 --> 00:06:30,892
And don't you dare touch my walls.

105
00:06:31,096 --> 00:06:33,229
You are spicy.
I like it.

106
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,024
There she is.

107
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:37,659
My leading lady.

108
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:41,278
Can you feel it...
The sexual tension?

109
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:44,906
How do I look?

110
00:06:47,446 --> 00:06:50,246
Don't stare, you fucking baboon.
It's rude!

111
00:06:50,407 --> 00:06:52,874
Christ on the cross,
what did you do to yourself?

112
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:54,709
You look like a fucking child!

113
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,040
A very hot child.

114
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,767
Who's been poorly waxed.
You cheated on me.

115
00:06:58,887 --> 00:07:01,257
I couldn't get an appointment,
and he told me to shave.

116
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:02,674
I told you to trim.

117
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:04,343
This is <i>Vaginatown</i>, sweetheart.

118
00:07:04,505 --> 00:07:07,763
They didn't have little heart-shaped
tufts of pubis in 1930's L.A.

119
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:11,216
Maybe not, but I think my
character was before her time.

120
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:13,561
Sorry. Who said it's your character?

121
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:16,256
We need a fucking merkin!

122
00:07:17,077 --> 00:07:19,358
You know what?
We've got a few of those lying around.

123
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:22,945
- You do? Why?
- Don't you tell him, Marce!

124
00:07:26,317 --> 00:07:28,483
Turn it this way,
it's like he's staring at you.

125
00:07:29,347 --> 00:07:32,038
You got to be kidding me, right?
That could be anybody.

126
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:35,499
But it's not, it's "the artist within"
and a very nice young girl named Holly.

127
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,435
It's like
one of those Jesus pictures,

128
00:07:37,555 --> 00:07:40,263
except it's his balls that follow you
wherever you move.

129
00:07:40,383 --> 00:07:42,548
See that brute-like appendage there?
It's actual-size.

130
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:45,258
You came all the way over here
to show me that?

131
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,954
- You're 12.
- No, this vindicates me.

132
00:07:49,074 --> 00:07:51,401
Proves the guy's a douche bag.
He's a danger to women.

133
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:53,829
- He has to be stopped.
- He's got to be stopped?

134
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:56,384
He manipulates them.
He fucks with their minds.

135
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,175
You're friends with Sonja.
Go tell her. You should.

136
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:02,401
Possibly. But you're the father
of her unborn child.

137
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:05,514
- So I think that trumps "friend."
- We don't know that for certain.

138
00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:08,818
We don't know for certain what kind
of arrangement they have, either.

139
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:10,868
They live together,
that's their arrangement.

140
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:14,454
Maybe they have one of those,
like, open relationship or something.

141
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:18,572
That is disgusting.
That is not a possibility.

142
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:20,840
The open relationship
does not exist.

143
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,463
It's like an oxymoron,
like "jumbo shrimp" or...

144
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,791
So that's where you draw the line?

145
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:27,449
At open relationships?

146
00:08:27,695 --> 00:08:29,295
That's thoroughly offensive to me.

147
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:32,264
The mouth-rapist who sleeps
with prostitutes is offended.

148
00:08:32,426 --> 00:08:33,723
No, come on. Look...

149
00:08:33,886 --> 00:08:37,185
My ethical unpredictability is
default proof of its hard-won vitality.

150
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:39,938
Because I'm not, like,
by rote or programmatic about it.

151
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:41,858
I think this shit through,
every issue.

152
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:45,577
Anyway, are you gonna go tattle to Sonja
or do I have to, 'cause I'd be glad to.

153
00:08:45,697 --> 00:08:47,655
Mind your own business.
Get out of here.

154
00:08:47,775 --> 00:08:49,726
- I'm minding our business.
- Go get Becca.

155
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:52,470
- She's at school.
- This conversation is not over.

156
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,774
Okay, Captain. What's the plan?

157
00:08:56,894 --> 00:08:58,918
We gonna be shooting
something at some point?

158
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,724
I promised my wife, you know,

159
00:09:00,844 --> 00:09:03,670
that the things
would clear out by, say...

160
00:09:03,832 --> 00:09:05,380
You promised your wife, did you?

161
00:09:06,263 --> 00:09:09,269
What is it you think we're doing here?
Does this look like Chatsworth?

162
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:11,704
Do I look like a Ukrainian
sex worker? No.

163
00:09:12,604 --> 00:09:14,568
We are making erotic art here...

164
00:09:15,117 --> 00:09:17,476
Something men...
and women, god-willing...

165
00:09:17,638 --> 00:09:20,020
will be pleasuring themselves to
for decades to come.

166
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:22,923
I get that. And I respect your vision.
Really, I do.

167
00:09:23,043 --> 00:09:25,049
But the neighbors
are getting a little restless.

168
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:27,714
I'd rather they don't call the cops
and have us shut down.

169
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:28,863
It's your money.

170
00:09:29,024 --> 00:09:31,023
But if you're looking
for transcendence...

171
00:09:33,098 --> 00:09:34,588
Bring in first team!

172
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:43,461
Where's Clittes?

173
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,913
Man, you look smoking
in that picture.

174
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:55,695
Happiest day of my life.

175
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:57,517
Your dad looks so proud.

176
00:09:58,199 --> 00:09:59,586
That's not my dad.

177
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:01,484
For Christ's sake, Marce.

178
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:05,751
You...

179
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:08,193
It's time to go down
and unleash the monster of cock.

180
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:11,908
Be careful what you wish for.

181
00:10:22,824 --> 00:10:24,910
This is what you came home
early for, isn't it?

182
00:10:25,578 --> 00:10:26,963
To do some cocaine.

183
00:10:27,363 --> 00:10:28,910
And watch some <i>Oprah</i>.

184
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:37,860
That thirsty little nose of yours
is costing us some money.

185
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,844
Have you checked
our bank balance lately?

186
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:42,068
Asshole,

187
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,567
you just put
the bulk of our nest egg

188
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,024
into a movie
called <i>Vaginatown.</i>

189
00:10:47,386 --> 00:10:49,318
And you're gonna make me feel bad

190
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:51,654
about a little afternoon snack
with Jake Clittes?

191
00:10:51,815 --> 00:10:53,738
This movie is an investment,

192
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,575
which we're in together, remember?

193
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:57,409
A little bit of support, please.

194
00:10:58,119 --> 00:11:00,364
And it's "Clittes,"
sounds like "titties."

195
00:11:04,408 --> 00:11:06,477
Well, if memory serves,
this is the part

196
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:09,463
where you say you can handle it
and that you can stop whenever you want.

197
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:10,965
I can stop.

198
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:12,126
Then stop.

199
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:13,796
For a day.

200
00:11:14,482 --> 00:11:15,511
For an hour.

201
00:11:16,836 --> 00:11:19,131
You can say "no, no, no" all you want,
Miss Winehouse.

202
00:11:19,251 --> 00:11:21,467
I'm this close to booking you
a room at <i>Wishes</i>.

203
00:11:21,976 --> 00:11:23,602
What happened to <i>Promises</i>?

204
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:26,604
<i>Promises</i> of Malibu is no longer
in the Runkle family budget.

205
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,697
<i>Wishes</i> is in Oxnard.

206
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:31,382
Runkle, bad news.
Daisy's in her trailer.

207
00:11:31,502 --> 00:11:33,564
She won't come out.
She'll only talk to you.

208
00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:37,780
We'll finish
this conversation later.

209
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:43,958
Don't you be condescending to me,
motherfucker.

210
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:46,739
I can stop.

211
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,613
I can stop
whenever the fuck I want.

212
00:12:03,409 --> 00:12:05,019
Good afternoon, ladies.

213
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,867
It's the sisterhood
of the travelling flannel.

214
00:12:09,267 --> 00:12:11,691
On time for a change.
Impressive.

215
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,852
We're still going to Lew Ashby's?

216
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,888
Yeah, we wanna go, too.

217
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:17,274
"We"?

218
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:20,304
Sorry. Hank Moody,
this is Annika Staley

219
00:12:20,424 --> 00:12:23,342
- of <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine.
- The <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine?

220
00:12:23,462 --> 00:12:25,675
The one that used to have
some cultural relevance?

221
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:28,750
Delighted to meet you, Annika Staley
from <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine.

222
00:12:29,722 --> 00:12:31,135
Sorry to crash the party.

223
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:34,507
I'm just trailing Mia for the day.
She's gonna be in our "hot" issue.

224
00:12:35,057 --> 00:12:36,299
She's hot, is she?

225
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:38,711
Feverish?

226
00:12:40,507 --> 00:12:42,124
Will you excuse me a moment?

227
00:12:43,566 --> 00:12:44,432
Sorry.

228
00:12:44,594 --> 00:12:45,594
Sure.

229
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:49,813
It's you, isn't it?

230
00:12:50,572 --> 00:12:52,877
I made a mess of your bush
this morning.

231
00:12:53,937 --> 00:12:54,937
That's...

232
00:12:55,313 --> 00:12:57,987
Shit, that came out wrong.
Flowers. She's got this...

233
00:12:58,602 --> 00:13:00,407
potted-flower thing, and I...

234
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:01,658
I'll see you guys.

235
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,785
It was nice talking to you, ladies.
This is a coincidence.

236
00:13:04,948 --> 00:13:08,331
I'm here picking up my daughter,
and I got some mail for you.

237
00:13:08,494 --> 00:13:09,608
- You do?
- Yeah.

238
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:12,877
You are "resident," aren't you?

239
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,020
But I doubt that you need
your carpets cleaned. Or your drapes.

240
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,484
I bet your carpets are immaculate
and they match the drapes.

241
00:13:18,604 --> 00:13:20,683
Do you always make
this good of a 1st impression?

242
00:13:20,803 --> 00:13:23,649
It's a second impression, actually.
Hank. Hank Moody.

243
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:25,724
They're only gonna get worse
from here on in,

244
00:13:25,886 --> 00:13:27,768
so I'll just lay my cards
on the table.

245
00:13:27,928 --> 00:13:29,436
- Do you know Lew Ashby?
- Yes,

246
00:13:29,598 --> 00:13:32,402
he's some famous record producer,
right? A rock'n'roll legend.

247
00:13:32,522 --> 00:13:34,942
- I'm writing a book on him.
- Good luck.

248
00:13:35,102 --> 00:13:38,738
Yes, I'm gonna need it because the guy's
a cypher. I can't get anywhere.

249
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:40,985
Then why do the research?
Just print the legend.

250
00:13:41,107 --> 00:13:43,826
That's what people want to read, right?
One long rock-n-roll

251
00:13:43,986 --> 00:13:47,180
bacchanalia where the music never ends,
the groupies never get older,

252
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,206
and your dick never
shrivels up and falls off

253
00:13:49,366 --> 00:13:51,417
from some unspecified
venereal disease.

254
00:13:52,306 --> 00:13:54,420
That was unkind to my dick.

255
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,466
I had to get you back
for ruining my bush.

256
00:13:57,952 --> 00:14:00,750
I've known the guy for 6 weeks now,
the only genuine moment

257
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,637
I've had with him is when he told me
about this woman he never got over and

258
00:14:03,797 --> 00:14:06,724
a mustang that wouldn't go in reverse.
That's why I was snooping around...

259
00:14:06,884 --> 00:14:09,401
I think you'd have better luck
finding the mustang.

260
00:14:10,046 --> 00:14:10,895
Why is that?

261
00:14:11,056 --> 00:14:13,224
'Cause it actually existed.
Blue with grey interior.

262
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:16,864
- And what about the girl?
- Figment of Lew's imagination.

263
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:38,917
I like your trailer.

264
00:14:40,098 --> 00:14:42,508
I drove out here
in this piece of shit.

265
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,469
I was gonna be a big, big star.

266
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,516
- Look at me now.
- Look,

267
00:14:48,676 --> 00:14:51,471
if you don't wanna do this,
if you wanna get out of porn...

268
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,395
I don't wanna get out of porn.

269
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:54,842
I love porn.

270
00:14:55,475 --> 00:14:56,475
Why?

271
00:14:57,942 --> 00:14:59,652
'Cause I love sex.

272
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,508
And I lost it at the movies.

273
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:03,945
Literally.

274
00:15:04,342 --> 00:15:05,563
I was 15,

275
00:15:06,427 --> 00:15:08,577
and my boyfriend
took me to the drive-in.

276
00:15:09,502 --> 00:15:11,747
They were showing a revival
of <i>Dirty dancing.</i>

277
00:15:11,907 --> 00:15:15,175
I love that movie!
Definitely in my top 10.

278
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:16,377
Mine too.

279
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,692
I just...
I got so turned on,

280
00:15:19,812 --> 00:15:22,299
I just jumped his bones
then and there.

281
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:26,027
And ever since, I've
associated movies and sex.

282
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:29,939
And I started to think, why does it have
to be a guilty pleasure?

283
00:15:30,212 --> 00:15:31,669
Everybody watches it.

284
00:15:32,221 --> 00:15:34,812
- You do, right?
- Very much so, yes.

285
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,043
Some might call it
a soft addiction.

286
00:15:37,163 --> 00:15:39,201
But then I got out here and...

287
00:15:40,317 --> 00:15:42,403
I just...
I saw what it really is.

288
00:15:42,564 --> 00:15:45,906
Just an endless series
of disgusting scenes

289
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:48,137
shot by disgusting people.

290
00:15:50,188 --> 00:15:51,738
But then you came along.

291
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:54,659
And you got me this close
to my dreams.

292
00:15:54,825 --> 00:15:57,918
- Well, that's a good thing, right?
- But it's scary.

293
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:02,679
- I mean, what if I suck?
- You do not suck, Daisy. Trust me.

294
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:06,093
If there's one thing I know,
it's porn, okay?

295
00:16:06,253 --> 00:16:08,762
And you got something
that those Silicone Valley gals don't...

296
00:16:09,014 --> 00:16:11,140
The 'x' factor.
It sets you apart.

297
00:16:11,652 --> 00:16:13,379
You're the girl next door,

298
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:15,883
America's fuckable sweetheart.

299
00:16:18,907 --> 00:16:21,525
I'm starting to get
that feeling, Charlie.

300
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,863
- What feeling would that be?
- The same one I got at the drive-in.

301
00:16:28,618 --> 00:16:30,656
We better get you inside, then.

302
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,715
Please. I beg you...

303
00:16:34,312 --> 00:16:36,681
Okay, people,
let's do this thing!

304
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:37,965
Come on...

305
00:16:39,203 --> 00:16:40,794
What's wrong with Clittes?

306
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,338
Coke dick.

307
00:16:42,498 --> 00:16:43,505
Coke dick?

308
00:16:43,954 --> 00:16:46,634
Too much blow,
and the cock won't grow.

309
00:16:47,788 --> 00:16:51,243
Thanks to your old lady, Jake here
is about as useful as tits on a nun.

310
00:16:51,975 --> 00:16:54,820
- We're gonna need a stunt cock.
- Stunt cock?

311
00:16:55,158 --> 00:16:56,651
You... Drop your pants.

312
00:17:01,735 --> 00:17:02,858
Call yourself a man?

313
00:17:04,618 --> 00:17:05,865
I weep for you.

314
00:17:07,473 --> 00:17:09,073
Runkle, what are you packing?

315
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:11,394
Me? What about you?

316
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:14,078
Why don't you whip out your
Hitch-cock and give it a cameo?

317
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,661
Our leading man is circumcised.
Can't say the same for myself.

318
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:21,251
Besides, I can go for hours.
We don't have time for that.

319
00:17:22,354 --> 00:17:24,254
Well, in that case...
Honey...

320
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,157
What?

321
00:17:26,277 --> 00:17:29,165
You've delivered plenty of one-minute
money shots in this living room.

322
00:17:29,285 --> 00:17:32,596
- One more's not gonna kill you.
- Have you lost your mind, woman?

323
00:17:32,756 --> 00:17:34,348
You actually want me
to do this?

324
00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:37,089
But I also don't want to live
in Park La Brea

325
00:17:37,209 --> 00:17:39,186
and eat cat food
when I'm old.

326
00:17:39,347 --> 00:17:40,688
100 grand, Runkle...

327
00:17:40,848 --> 00:17:41,958
The nest egg.

328
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:44,880
And if our blessed union
means anything to you,

329
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,779
you will get in there
and drive miss Daisy, ho.

330
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:12,928
I think what I love most
about Mia's book

331
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:14,762
is how visceral it is.

332
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,588
That's my daughter.

333
00:18:18,229 --> 00:18:19,706
Yeah, great.

334
00:18:20,012 --> 00:18:22,630
I guess it's too much to ask
of a writer from <i>Rolling Stone</i>

335
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,630
- to love music.
- It's not my beat.

336
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,445
Right. You cover words.

337
00:18:27,394 --> 00:18:29,008
All words or just...

338
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:31,363
Just the hot ones?

339
00:18:31,729 --> 00:18:34,158
Why don't you find out?
Let me interview you.

340
00:18:34,318 --> 00:18:35,451
God, no.

341
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:37,870
Come on, come on.
You know you want to.

342
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,288
No, I don't want to.

343
00:18:39,448 --> 00:18:41,874
Come on. We can have a drink,
we'll talk about Mia.

344
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:45,754
I'm sure Mia is perfectly capable
of talking about herself.

345
00:18:46,986 --> 00:18:48,826
Will you excuse me for a moment?

346
00:18:50,744 --> 00:18:54,219
That is a lovely shade of blue
your face is wearing.

347
00:18:54,339 --> 00:18:57,097
- God. I think I'm gonna...
- You gonna...

348
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:04,438
Everyone said it would
stop in the second trimester.

349
00:19:04,598 --> 00:19:07,654
- Crap, did I get some on your foot?
- No. No worries.

350
00:19:07,774 --> 00:19:10,486
Unlike you, I'm not
a big sympathetic vomiter.

351
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:11,883
Thanks.

352
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,199
- Julian thinks that all...
- Here you go.

353
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:17,086
... physical illness...
Thank you...

354
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:20,037
is... due to some,
you know, mental weakness.

355
00:19:20,197 --> 00:19:21,603
- Really?
- Yeah.

356
00:19:21,932 --> 00:19:23,481
What causes cancer?

357
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:25,617
- Bitter... No.
- Bitterness.

358
00:19:25,737 --> 00:19:26,918
That's not it.

359
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,631
- Sloth.
- No, it's not that.

360
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:29,880
Wait, wait...

361
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:32,591
- Fear.
- Fear. Let's alert the fucking media!

362
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:35,648
Let's get that shit taken care of.
End suffering in our time.

363
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:41,286
Isn't he here? I thought he was working
with Lew this week.

364
00:19:41,406 --> 00:19:43,171
No. He was here, earlier.

365
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:46,959
- Laying hands on the faithful.
- Only his hands?

366
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:49,733
- Possibly more.
- God, I knew it.

367
00:19:49,893 --> 00:19:52,219
Every time he comes here,
he ends up boning some groupie.

368
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:53,737
And that's fucked up, right?

369
00:19:53,897 --> 00:19:55,811
When you're with somebody,
you shouldn't be off

370
00:19:55,943 --> 00:19:58,069
boning some stranger,
doggy-style, right?

371
00:19:58,868 --> 00:19:59,872
Right?

372
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:01,161
That's bullshit.

373
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:04,540
Right? You're not reacting
the way I thought you'd react.

374
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,416
We kind of have
an open relationship...

375
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:08,021
No shit.

376
00:20:08,846 --> 00:20:10,792
You know...
It's how you grow.

377
00:20:10,957 --> 00:20:13,172
- Is that how you grow?
- You have to validate yourself,

378
00:20:13,334 --> 00:20:15,334
assuage your own insecurities,

379
00:20:15,502 --> 00:20:18,595
because you can't rely on other people
to bring that shit to the table.

380
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:21,492
If you don't mind my asking,
If he's not being faithful

381
00:20:21,612 --> 00:20:24,689
and he's not the father of your child,
what is he bringing to the table?

382
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:26,270
Aside from the facial hair?

383
00:20:27,952 --> 00:20:30,562
Okay, look.
This could be my last chance.

384
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,201
And fuck it.
I'm not one of those people

385
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:37,389
who works alone.
I need to be with somebody.

386
00:20:38,391 --> 00:20:40,993
I mean, for Christ Sakes,
I was married to a big homo

387
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:42,728
for like 10 years, right?

388
00:20:42,848 --> 00:20:44,125
- Shit.
- You alright?

389
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:46,665
- No. I mean, I don't know.
- You got to puke again?

390
00:20:46,825 --> 00:20:49,189
- You got to poop?
- No, I don't have to poop!

391
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:52,796
I felt something move! It moved,
and I've never felt that before.

392
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,441
Hang on. Here, here.

393
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,041
Just feel that.

394
00:20:57,332 --> 00:20:58,135
Anything?

395
00:20:58,297 --> 00:21:00,596
- No. Little gas, maybe.
- No, it's not gas.

396
00:21:02,288 --> 00:21:03,568
No. Nothing.

397
00:21:03,688 --> 00:21:05,309
- I swear.
- Hold on. Let me.

398
00:21:06,524 --> 00:21:07,725
Hello, in there.

399
00:21:08,464 --> 00:21:09,655
Anybody home?

400
00:21:11,023 --> 00:21:12,440
Anybody home?

401
00:21:13,352 --> 00:21:16,191
- Shit, I felt... Yes.
- Right? Isn't that weird?

402
00:21:16,311 --> 00:21:17,446
Hey, guys.

403
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:20,440
- This feels kind of familiar.
- God, Karen. Hey.

404
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,202
- Sounds good. Sounds good.
- Thanks.

405
00:21:23,947 --> 00:21:25,417
Alright, I'm gonna...

406
00:21:25,537 --> 00:21:27,890
I'm gonna go try to find

407
00:21:28,283 --> 00:21:29,545
Julian. Thank you.

408
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:30,499
Okay.

409
00:21:32,505 --> 00:21:35,029
I don't say this often enough,
so I'm just gonna...

410
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:36,801
I'm gonna come out and say it.

411
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,634
- What?
- You were right.

412
00:21:38,795 --> 00:21:41,413
- About what?
- They do have an open relationship.

413
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,646
You just couldn't stay out of it,
could you?

414
00:21:44,143 --> 00:21:45,098
Good.

415
00:21:45,587 --> 00:21:48,130
- Why? What does that mean?
- You know, only a total asshole

416
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,125
would get someone pregnant and then
sit back and do nothing about it.

417
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:54,413
And you got involved. That's good.
That's progress for you. Hey, well done.

418
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:55,460
Well done.

419
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,425
Becca. Come on, let's go.

420
00:21:57,589 --> 00:21:59,890
- No way. This is too much fun.
- Grab your stuff.

421
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,115
It's late. Don't argue with me.
We're going.

422
00:22:02,275 --> 00:22:03,275
Fine.

423
00:22:04,486 --> 00:22:06,497
Don't worry,
I've been keeping an eye on her.

424
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:09,915
Well, that's great. And who's
been keeping an eye on you?

425
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,603
Good night, sweetie.

426
00:22:13,421 --> 00:22:14,828
Such nice friends.

427
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,391
You kind of look like
you could use that drink.

428
00:22:26,517 --> 00:22:29,073
- Not so rough.
- Would you quit squirming around?

429
00:22:29,205 --> 00:22:32,521
I'm just trying to make your man-bush
a little more camera-ready.

430
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:36,483
Yeah, and I'm getting the feeling
that you're not so okay about this.

431
00:22:37,046 --> 00:22:39,643
Look, I'm as okay
as I can possibly be.

432
00:22:39,853 --> 00:22:41,947
You, on the other hand,
don't seem that excited,

433
00:22:42,526 --> 00:22:44,458
especially
for a guy who's about to get

434
00:22:44,578 --> 00:22:46,604
a little wife-sanctioned strizz-ange.

435
00:22:46,724 --> 00:22:48,996
You know, maybe
a little less with the scissor,

436
00:22:49,156 --> 00:22:51,137
and, I don't know.
Could you, like...

437
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:53,448
do that thing...

438
00:22:53,681 --> 00:22:54,668
you do?

439
00:22:57,569 --> 00:22:58,569
Jesus.

440
00:23:07,531 --> 00:23:09,356
Almost ready for you, Runkle.

441
00:23:11,218 --> 00:23:13,241
I knew you had it in you, missus.

442
00:23:13,597 --> 00:23:14,563
Do you mind?

443
00:23:22,522 --> 00:23:25,490
Now there's the porcelain monkey
I know and love.

444
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:30,912
I'm doing this for us.

445
00:23:33,054 --> 00:23:34,054
I know.

446
00:23:35,272 --> 00:23:37,127
Now go get 'em, quickdraw.

447
00:23:52,876 --> 00:23:55,008
You're gonna be great, co-star.

448
00:23:57,462 --> 00:23:59,410
How's it look?
Does it look okay?

449
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,165
It's perfect, Charlie.

450
00:24:01,285 --> 00:24:02,601
You're perfect.

451
00:24:04,506 --> 00:24:06,310
All right, quiet, please!

452
00:24:06,884 --> 00:24:08,319
Rolling!

453
00:24:08,557 --> 00:24:09,557
And...

454
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:11,278
action!

455
00:24:17,795 --> 00:24:19,278
- Shit.
- Charlie...

456
00:24:19,454 --> 00:24:21,613
I know that look.
He's gonna blow.

457
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,964
Slow down, Runkle.

458
00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:27,753
Forget it, Jake.

459
00:24:28,046 --> 00:24:29,385
It's <i>Vaginatown</i>!

460
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:37,919
And cut!

461
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:39,760
Did we get that?

462
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,983
Did we get it?
Please tell me you got that.

463
00:24:42,992 --> 00:24:44,236
That'll do, Runkle.

464
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:45,874
That'll do.

465
00:25:03,082 --> 00:25:04,250
God, you're...

466
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:08,127
- exactly like your books.
- I'm exactly like my books?

467
00:25:08,247 --> 00:25:10,152
Yes. Totally puerile...

468
00:25:11,892 --> 00:25:12,831
crass...

469
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:17,146
- adolescent...
- No, I know what "puerile" means.

470
00:25:17,445 --> 00:25:20,506
I'm actually just a little surprised
that you read my books at all.

471
00:25:20,626 --> 00:25:21,940
Yeah. Well, sure.

472
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,499
You know, I try to read
all the great misogynists.

473
00:25:24,619 --> 00:25:26,787
It really fuels my feminist fire.

474
00:25:27,753 --> 00:25:29,742
In fact, I actually...

475
00:25:30,438 --> 00:25:32,757
- wrote a review of your first novel.
- Did you?

476
00:25:32,877 --> 00:25:34,259
For a little magazine

477
00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:36,619
- back in Chicago.
- What'd you say?

478
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:39,558
I said the main character
was a self-righteous prick

479
00:25:39,678 --> 00:25:42,752
no woman in a million years
would ever actually sleep with.

480
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:46,400
- I called it "a retarded man's"...
- "portnoy's complaint."

481
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,120
I remember that review,
one of the worst reviews I ever got.

482
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,235
I don't know if we can be drinking
buddies anymore, Annika Staley.

483
00:25:52,355 --> 00:25:54,422
- That was downright vicious.
- Thank you.

484
00:25:54,542 --> 00:25:56,986
What would possess you
to write something like that?

485
00:25:57,106 --> 00:26:00,064
I was kind of going through
a little rough patch in my life,

486
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:02,207
was working out my issues with guys.

487
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,023
You think? When I read that,

488
00:26:04,143 --> 00:26:06,743
I wanted to muff-punch you
with my typewriter.

489
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,314
You still want to?

490
00:26:25,455 --> 00:26:27,652
I may need to take back "puerile."

491
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:31,974
So you're saying you're willing
to reevaluate my oeuvre.

492
00:26:34,065 --> 00:26:35,347
Do we got aftershock?

493
00:26:35,508 --> 00:26:36,882
No, no. Toe cramp.

494
00:26:37,002 --> 00:26:38,970
- Flex that shit.
- Fuck, that hurts!

495
00:26:39,496 --> 00:26:41,550
- I got it. Like a doctor.
- Please stop this.

496
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,585
Please, I just need some water.
I'm just really dehydrated.

497
00:26:44,705 --> 00:26:47,404
I just need
something with electrolytes.

498
00:26:49,762 --> 00:26:51,113
Vagatorade.

499
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:54,044
- Yeah.
- Good one. That was nice.

500
00:27:02,853 --> 00:27:05,669
- Who's the screamer?
- It's the writer woman

501
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:09,248
- from Rolling Stone.
- Nice! Got me off my rhythm, though.

502
00:27:09,416 --> 00:27:11,480
The chick I was with,
just about to come,

503
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,010
hears the other one scream,
jumps right out of her skin.

504
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:17,142
- Sorry.
- For a second there,

505
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:19,838
I thought she was gonna hit me
or something, punch me.

506
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:20,809
