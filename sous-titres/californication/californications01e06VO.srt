1
00:00:01,521 --> 00:00:03,803
- My name is Hank.
- I know.

2
00:00:06,023 --> 00:00:08,003
This is Mia, Bill's daughter.

3
00:00:08,263 --> 00:00:09,338
And this is Hank.

4
00:00:09,608 --> 00:00:10,964
- You know each other?
- No.

5
00:00:11,198 --> 00:00:13,892
- I am 16, you know.
- So I've been told.

6
00:00:14,032 --> 00:00:15,344
I got to ask you a favor.

7
00:00:15,604 --> 00:00:17,930
I was supposed to be the guest speaker
at Mia's school,

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,431
but I have to go out of town.

9
00:00:19,692 --> 00:00:20,875
They're very young.

10
00:00:21,159 --> 00:00:23,187
Say that again... slower this time.

11
00:00:23,506 --> 00:00:25,084
My fleshy T.A. didn't hear you.

12
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:26,855
Just be careful of him

13
00:00:27,115 --> 00:00:28,463
and those of his ilk.

14
00:00:28,603 --> 00:00:31,507
Hank Moody, as I live and breathe,
are you looking out for me?

15
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,545
- Back to work.
- Yes, sir.

16
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:35,823
Anything you want
to tell me about, captain?

17
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:37,366
Please. I'm a married man.

18
00:00:40,058 --> 00:00:42,389
In this past life of ours, was I mean?

19
00:00:42,663 --> 00:00:46,139
You weren't mean, no.
But you can be pretty hard on people.

20
00:00:46,426 --> 00:00:49,075
- I wish it was different.
- And so do I.

21
00:00:50,365 --> 00:00:55,092
Subtitle : swsub.com

22
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:29,668
Do you know anything about wine?

23
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:34,156
Wine is fine, but whiskey is quicker.

24
00:01:34,855 --> 00:01:36,912
"Suicide is slow with liquor."

25
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:39,899
Sabbath.

26
00:01:40,188 --> 00:01:41,655
Close... Ozzy, solo.

27
00:01:43,324 --> 00:01:44,422
But nice try.

28
00:01:44,994 --> 00:01:46,007
Thanks...

29
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,248
That stuff will kill you.

30
00:01:48,785 --> 00:01:50,222
Life will kill you.

31
00:01:51,288 --> 00:01:52,316
That's heavy.

32
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:53,879
It will make sense.

33
00:01:54,316 --> 00:01:55,518
Taking it in.

34
00:01:55,787 --> 00:01:56,972
Let it sink in.

35
00:02:05,088 --> 00:02:06,262
Here you go.

36
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:10,038
No, no. I can't let you do that.

37
00:02:10,302 --> 00:02:13,462
Unless you've got some "fuck you" money
stashed up your whosie-whatsit,

38
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:15,255
you're shit out of places to look.

39
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:16,756
So just take it.

40
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,092
- You're sweet.
- It's my pleasure.

41
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:20,414
And cute.

42
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:24,600
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

43
00:02:29,086 --> 00:02:29,895
What?

44
00:02:30,437 --> 00:02:32,119
It's a damsel in distress.

45
00:02:32,692 --> 00:02:34,589
I love all women. I love you.

46
00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:37,694
I'll make a run at you, crusty. I will.

47
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:54,437
- I fucking love vinyl.
- Yeah,

48
00:03:54,697 --> 00:03:56,308
it just sounds better.

49
00:03:57,327 --> 00:03:58,852
It's warmer, right?

50
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,394
It's just human.

51
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:04,656
You're just an analog guy
in a digital world, aren't you?

52
00:04:05,584 --> 00:04:06,993
I might steal that.

53
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:11,711
What is your name, by the way?

54
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:16,971
Wouldn't you rather just fuck me
and never know?

55
00:04:17,574 --> 00:04:19,884
Oh, fuck. who says romance is dead?

56
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:06,498
Oh, shit. You again?

57
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:10,146
Fuck me.

58
00:05:10,596 --> 00:05:13,272
- All right, sure. why not?
- Stop it. I've been robbed.

59
00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:17,175
- Save the drama for your mama.
- She stole my guitar...

60
00:05:17,663 --> 00:05:18,831
and my records.

61
00:05:19,398 --> 00:05:21,979
My records! Oh, the humanity!

62
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:23,693
Who did this?

63
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,635
- I don't know. some girl.
- She let you have access

64
00:05:26,775 --> 00:05:29,366
to the most intimate of her areas,
she didn't give you her name?

65
00:05:29,626 --> 00:05:31,986
Well, it seemed like a pretty
fair trade-off at the time.

66
00:05:32,253 --> 00:05:33,342
What do you want?

67
00:05:33,482 --> 00:05:34,502
I don't know.

68
00:05:34,642 --> 00:05:38,917
Peace in the Middle East, a 2 h orgasm,
a few pages of your lesser work.

69
00:05:39,198 --> 00:05:40,378
That is not possible.

70
00:05:40,518 --> 00:05:43,514
There is no such thing as a 2 h orgasm
or my lesser work.

71
00:05:43,654 --> 00:05:45,056
You're shit out of luck.

72
00:05:46,768 --> 00:05:48,760
Yes... No, if you want lesser work,

73
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:50,679
just write something yourself.

74
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:53,294
- I can't. I'm lazy.
- I'll say.

75
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:55,360
- I'll cry rape.
- No, you won't.

76
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,930
How do you know?

77
00:05:57,197 --> 00:05:59,038
'Cause you enjoy torturing me too much.

78
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:02,315
- That's true.
- Okay, listen, you just

79
00:06:02,743 --> 00:06:04,149
write something...

80
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:07,512
Anything...
Okay, and I will help you with it.

81
00:06:07,872 --> 00:06:09,540
- I'll give you notes.
- Really?

82
00:06:10,901 --> 00:06:13,708
- You'd do that for me?
- Of course. Why wouldn't I?

83
00:06:14,545 --> 00:06:16,193
My own father hasn't even so much

84
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,623
as offered to help me
with my homework, so...

85
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,419
You know, as much as I love to hear
about Bill's failings as a parent,

86
00:06:22,922 --> 00:06:25,964
I do not like to be compared to him
in the same sentence.

87
00:06:26,224 --> 00:06:27,340
It creeps me out.

88
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,509
Given that you've
been inside of me and all?

89
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:32,637
Something like that, okay.
Now, you're a smart little sociopath.

90
00:06:32,897 --> 00:06:34,894
I'm sure you can
put two sentences together.

91
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:36,084
Now scram.

92
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,519
You wanted me?

93
00:06:42,427 --> 00:06:46,234
You know, I dropped an Advil on the
floor earlier and couldn't find it.

94
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:47,902
I thought maybe you could...

95
00:06:49,032 --> 00:06:50,613
crawl around and look for it.

96
00:06:51,606 --> 00:06:53,127
Whatever you say, boss.

97
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,039
Go slowly.
I don't want you to miss anything.

98
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:03,533
Yes, boss.
Maybe I should look more closely.

99
00:07:10,183 --> 00:07:12,177
Poor you. your head must be throbbing.

100
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,095
It is...

101
00:07:14,355 --> 00:07:15,632
actually, a bit.

102
00:07:20,612 --> 00:07:22,828
- Anybody home?
- Hey, baby!

103
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:24,189
Hi, baby.

104
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:25,773
Good afternoon, Mrs. Runkle.

105
00:07:27,825 --> 00:07:28,943
Dani?

106
00:07:30,607 --> 00:07:32,113
What's going on?

107
00:07:32,373 --> 00:07:34,905
I dropped an Advil on the floor
earlier and couldn't find it.

108
00:07:35,045 --> 00:07:37,285
I looked myself, you know.
And then my back just...

109
00:07:38,002 --> 00:07:39,072
Found it!

110
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,348
Thank you, Dani.

111
00:07:46,723 --> 00:07:48,046
That's an Advil.

112
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,424
You can take lunch.

113
00:07:51,788 --> 00:07:53,551
I'll just eat something at my desk.

114
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,750
It was nice to see you, Mrs. Runkle.

115
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,744
She's like your little slave, that one.

116
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:13,355
You want to get lunch?

117
00:08:15,455 --> 00:08:17,127
I'd rather get laid.

118
00:08:19,025 --> 00:08:20,386
Excuse me?

119
00:08:20,671 --> 00:08:24,457
I want to change things up a little bit.
I used to come by for nooners

120
00:08:24,717 --> 00:08:26,376
all the time when you were at CAA.

121
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:29,294
Yeah, well, that was CAA.
everybody was fucking everybody.

122
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:31,913
Besides, Dani's right outside, there.

123
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,424
Even better.

124
00:08:34,826 --> 00:08:38,262
Come on. I'll lap-dance you
if you throw me 20 bucks.

125
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,617
You're already halfway there.

126
00:08:45,963 --> 00:08:46,979
That's it.

127
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,195
That's it, baby. But take your time.

128
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,458
Take your time. Take your...

129
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,291
Maybe I'll hit Nordstrom's.

130
00:09:07,777 --> 00:09:09,988
<i>All right, testing, testing, 1, 2.</i>

131
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:15,466
Good. You're on time, as usual.

132
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,220
This chick stole my t-shirt...
my favorite t-shirt.

133
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,764
- Just seat.
- The "Keith Richards President" one.

134
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:25,318
The one I got you
at that little poutiquey place?

135
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:28,104
- I love that.
- I know. I'm sad about it.

136
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:30,690
Why did she steal your t-shirt?

137
00:09:31,294 --> 00:09:33,584
- You really want to know?
- Good point.

138
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:37,048
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
from Venice, California,</i>

139
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:39,782
<i>please welcome Kill Jill!</i>

1
00:10:13,964 --> 00:10:15,372
Are you crying?

2
00:10:16,403 --> 00:10:17,652
Shut up.

3
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,438
They're allergies.

4
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,631
We should do this more often.

5
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:56,622
I'm not deluded or anything.

6
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:59,239
I know you guys aren't gonna live
happily ever after.

7
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:01,558
It's just nice
to be together sometimes.

8
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:05,648
As long as you don't hate each other,
I don't see what the big deal is.

9
00:11:10,602 --> 00:11:13,072
Oh, you know...
this could be uncle Charlie.

10
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:14,404
So I'm gonna just...

11
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,170
- Yes.
- You have to come get me.

12
00:11:21,517 --> 00:11:23,735
No, I can't do that.
I'm a little busy right now.

13
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,187
Asshole, you have to.
I'm in trouble.

14
00:11:27,477 --> 00:11:28,703
What kind of trouble?

15
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:31,330
Remember my teacher?

16
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,730
He's coked out of his mind,
he's trying to get me into a threesome.

17
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,778
- Jesus. Fuck.
- <i>I can't call Karen 'cause</i>

18
00:11:37,952 --> 00:11:40,194
she'll tell my dad,
and I'll be in a world of shit.

19
00:11:40,454 --> 00:11:42,757
Don't you have friends
who can come get you,

20
00:11:42,933 --> 00:11:46,049
<i>- one with a fucking learner's permit?</i>
- Aren't you my friend, Hank?

21
00:11:47,236 --> 00:11:49,045
- In a word, no.
<i>- Ok, whatever.</i>

22
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:51,629
Don't worry about it.
I'll figure it out myself.

23
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:54,544
<i>Get the fuck off me, you asshole!</i>

24
00:11:55,938 --> 00:11:57,143
Hold on, where are you?

25
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:03,162
You wanna go to the movies with us, dad?

26
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:04,865
Oh, would that I could,

27
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:07,471
but it turns out that was
bald old uncle Charlie.

28
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:09,265
He's going through a rough patch,

29
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:11,727
and he kind of needs
a friendly ear, so...

30
00:12:11,955 --> 00:12:14,594
Uncle Charlie, huh?
Just an ear? Nothing else?

31
00:12:14,863 --> 00:12:17,127
Do you think
I'd rather be anywhere else?

32
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:43,637
Moody! Hank fucking moody!
You came!

33
00:12:43,777 --> 00:12:46,093
What the fuck is up,
my brother from another mother?

34
00:12:46,353 --> 00:12:47,720
Where is she?

35
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,664
Mia? I don't know.
She said she was gonna call you.

36
00:12:51,121 --> 00:12:53,991
- Glad you could make it, mofro.
- You were expecting me?

37
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:57,491
Yeah, we thought
you might want to partake. Line?

38
00:13:01,165 --> 00:13:02,311
Let's go.

39
00:13:02,884 --> 00:13:04,193
Where are you going?

40
00:13:04,405 --> 00:13:06,573
I was hoping you'd want
to get in on this action.

41
00:13:06,713 --> 00:13:08,001
Get in on what action?

42
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,709
You and me and </i>Betty and Veronica</i>
here make 3.

43
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,103
Well, 4, actually. I'm sorry.

44
00:13:13,338 --> 00:13:16,449
My bad. I'm fucking
snow-blind right now.

45
00:13:16,717 --> 00:13:18,543
- You need to get out of the way.
- OK!

46
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,930
You're a one-on-one kind of guy.
Tap that ass, dude. Go for it.

47
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,184
Hey, you've got to
drink the nectar, right?

48
00:13:25,522 --> 00:13:26,879
One more word...

49
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:33,533
And I put you through
that fucking wall.

50
00:13:36,502 --> 00:13:38,414
Would you read something
of mine sometime?

51
00:13:38,627 --> 00:13:39,627
That's good.

52
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:55,486
Fine. Give me the silent treatment.

53
00:13:56,114 --> 00:13:58,582
- See where it gets you.
- What were you thinking?

54
00:13:59,693 --> 00:14:00,853
I wanted out of there.

55
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,077
- You weren't in trouble.
- Sure I was.

56
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,024
I was in danger
of being bored to death.

57
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,966
- You cried wolf.
- So?

58
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:08,717
Maybe I just wanted to see you.

59
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:13,264
Did you ever think that maybe
I did not want to see you?

60
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,646
Never entered my mind.
You enjoy the banter too much.

61
00:14:16,786 --> 00:14:19,436
What I was enjoying was
spending time with my daughter.

62
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:23,078
- And Karen?
- Yes, and Karen.

63
00:14:23,218 --> 00:14:25,427
- Don't enjoy it too much, pal.
- Why not?

64
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,278
Because she's marrying my father.

65
00:14:27,538 --> 00:14:30,012
You don't even like the guy.
What do you care?

66
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:32,340
Yeah, maybe he's not much
of a parental figure.

67
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,407
It doesn't mean
I don't wanna see him happy.

68
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:36,482
And she makes him happy, Hank.

69
00:14:36,787 --> 00:14:39,092
Captain fantastic.

70
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:43,427
But the question is
does he make her happy?

71
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:46,839
That's what you really want to know.
Why can't you just ask me?

72
00:14:47,015 --> 00:14:49,613
- Why don't you just fuck off?
- Come on.

73
00:14:49,908 --> 00:14:51,958
What do you think?
In your heart or hearts,

74
00:14:52,427 --> 00:14:53,826
what's your best guess?

75
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,124
I don't know.

76
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:05,801
Thanks for the ride.

77
00:15:21,298 --> 00:15:22,541
How's uncle Charlie?

78
00:15:23,225 --> 00:15:26,441
I just came by to say goodnight
to our little Courtney Love in training.

79
00:15:26,581 --> 00:15:29,439
Well, she went to celebrate
with her band mates.

80
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,563
Will you please tell her that I will
call her first thing in the morning?

81
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,019
Yes, I will.

82
00:15:36,954 --> 00:15:38,484
Whoa, she was a...

83
00:15:39,997 --> 00:15:41,566
She was good tonight, huh?

84
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:44,396
- I know. She was incredible.
- And we made that.

85
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,296
You made it.

86
00:15:46,575 --> 00:15:48,984
- You helped, like, a teeny bit.
- I give you that.

87
00:15:50,752 --> 00:15:51,804
All right.

88
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,103
I apologize. Good night.

89
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:59,652
Do you want to come in for a drink?

90
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:15,511
So, uh, did Dani
say anything to you

91
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,933
about our little afternoon session?

92
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:25,304
Well, I mean, even if she heard,

93
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:28,425
it's not like I talk about
my love life with my assistant.

94
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:36,328
Although, I have to say...

95
00:16:36,468 --> 00:16:38,595
when you said that thing
about her being my slave,

96
00:16:38,809 --> 00:16:40,763
It did get me kind of thinking.

97
00:16:41,938 --> 00:16:44,706
- Thinking about what?
- You know, um...

98
00:16:45,108 --> 00:16:47,798
role-playing.
You know, master/slave,

99
00:16:47,938 --> 00:16:49,362
dominance/submission...

100
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:50,909
bondage.

101
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,342
You know, we never tried
any of that stuff.

102
00:16:54,142 --> 00:16:57,836
I'm just trying to, you know, mix things up a little bit, like you did today.

103
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:03,037
Okay, I hear you. So...

104
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:05,280
you want me to
beat the crap out of you?

105
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:11,599
If you want, I guess.

106
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,858
Or, you know, I could beat you up,

107
00:17:14,998 --> 00:17:16,407
whichever you prefer.

108
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:18,095
Or nobody has to beat anybody up.

109
00:17:18,235 --> 00:17:20,171
We just... There's a master
and a slave.

110
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:23,625
And the slave does whatever
the master tells her to.

111
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:28,125
"Her" being me, your slave.

112
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:30,587
In that example, yeah.

113
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:34,853
Okay, so...

114
00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:38,057
What do you want me to do?

115
00:17:40,358 --> 00:17:42,806
You know, whatever
makes you happy, right?

116
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:47,185
Maybe you want me to make you
wear a ball gag in your mouth.

117
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:50,856
Or maybe you would want me to drip
hot candle wax on your nipples.

118
00:17:51,777 --> 00:17:53,570
Or maybe you like to be teased?

119
00:17:53,886 --> 00:17:57,322
I could bring you to the brink of orgasm
without ever letting you come.

120
00:17:58,223 --> 00:17:59,824
I feel like we've done that.

121
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:06,384
All right, maybe...
maybe you want me to pee on you.

122
00:18:06,673 --> 00:18:09,709
- Why would I want you to pee on me?
- I don't know. I just...

123
00:18:09,849 --> 00:18:11,534
I know there's people that do that.

124
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:13,129
Okay, that's all.

125
00:18:13,597 --> 00:18:15,241
Look, baby, I'm in.

126
00:18:15,589 --> 00:18:18,396
Just start doing some shit to me.

127
00:18:18,668 --> 00:18:20,668
We'll see how it goes, okay?

128
00:18:24,118 --> 00:18:26,350
You know what, we should
probably have a safe word,

129
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,058
so I know what your limits are.

130
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:31,744
How about, "don't pee on me"?

131
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:34,167
Okay, that should work.

132
00:18:37,632 --> 00:18:40,280
- God damn it!
- Sorry. Sorry.

133
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,741
- Okay, okay, let me rub it.
- That hurts.

134
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:44,826
- I'll rub it.
- Don't touch it.

1
00:18:56,405 --> 00:19:00,696
What would you do if our little spawn

2
00:19:01,168 --> 00:19:05,028
- actually became, like, a rock star?
- I would be really proud of her.

3
00:19:05,168 --> 00:19:07,093
- You would?
- And I would be there

4
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,089
to help pump her stomach when she od'd.

5
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,231
Oh, God.

6
00:19:12,056 --> 00:19:13,511
Do you think she's ever...

7
00:19:14,495 --> 00:19:17,694
Do you think she's ever smoked pot?
I mean, like, successfully.

8
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:21,617
No, no, she told me
that she saw you and Bill get high once,

9
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:23,728
and it so creeped her out

10
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:26,339
that she swore to me
she was never gonna try it.

11
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:28,112
So, well done with that.

12
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:30,367
Yeah?

13
00:19:30,822 --> 00:19:32,049
Bill saw...

14
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:35,917
- he saw a spider.
- A spider?

15
00:19:36,153 --> 00:19:40,172
That guy, he is the biggest
fucking pansy in captivity.

16
00:19:42,135 --> 00:19:43,210
You happy?

17
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,947
- What?
- It's a simple question. are you happy?

18
00:19:48,528 --> 00:19:50,421
I don't even know
what that means anymore.

19
00:19:50,734 --> 00:19:53,088
All right, I'll...
I'll make it specific.

20
00:19:53,238 --> 00:19:55,188
Does Bill make you happy?

21
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,649
- Yes.
- Bullshit!

22
00:20:01,057 --> 00:20:02,821
He does. He makes me really happy.

23
00:20:03,104 --> 00:20:04,406
Like I made you happy?

24
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,400
You made me fucking insane.

25
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,826
So I never made you happy?
I made you insane?

26
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:12,175
I mean, once upon a time,
you made me happy.

27
00:20:12,315 --> 00:20:13,939
But then you made me crazy,

28
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,948
and that was okay, too, for a while.

29
00:20:16,446 --> 00:20:18,239
But then I... I evolved.

30
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,880
You outgrew me. I understand.

31
00:20:21,228 --> 00:20:22,717
And I didn't?

32
00:20:22,857 --> 00:20:24,789
No, you stayed right in the crazy zone.

33
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:29,275
Well, that is a hell of a way
to sum up a decade-long love affair.

34
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,712
Well, Mr. Moody...

35
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,060
how would you sum it up?

36
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:38,189
I would say we loved each other
too much. Too much.

37
00:20:38,607 --> 00:20:41,484
And I think we made the mistake
of getting it right the first time,

38
00:20:42,215 --> 00:20:45,950
and that put an insane amount
of pressure on us to keep it going.

39
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,120
And... We buckled.

40
00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:52,227
You know what I miss most about?

41
00:20:52,706 --> 00:20:55,325
Well, aside from Becca, of course.

42
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,003
I miss your smell.

43
00:21:00,758 --> 00:21:01,758
That's it?

44
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:03,802
When you left,
I couldn't wash the sheets

45
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,276
because I didn't want to
lose that completely...

46
00:21:06,436 --> 00:21:07,819
You. And...

47
00:21:08,177 --> 00:21:09,763
it fucked me up for a long time

48
00:21:10,023 --> 00:21:13,150
because I would wake up
and I'd smell you

49
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,150
and I'd think you were there.

50
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,960
And that would...
My heart would break all over again.

51
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,152
I think that's why I go in
for the kiss all the time. I know, yeah.

52
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:26,607
I think I'm going for... another hit.

53
00:21:27,756 --> 00:21:29,699
Have you washed those sheets yet?

54
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:33,550
Oh, well, you know,
I had to throw them away.

55
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,690
Oh, good.

56
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,707
Yeah, this hot little Starbucks barista
got her period all over them.

57
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,044
You're so fucking disgusting.

58
00:21:42,357 --> 00:21:45,230
- Look at that. You see?
- Why do you have to say shit like that?

59
00:21:45,464 --> 00:21:48,606
If I can make you laugh like that,
why can't we be together?

60
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:50,932
- That's what I don't understand.
- You know what?

61
00:21:51,138 --> 00:21:54,349
You don't want to be with me.
You think... I know you think you do.

62
00:21:56,501 --> 00:22:00,402
But if I were to give myself to you,
you would run for the hills,

63
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:03,062
'cause you're not in love with me.
You're in love

64
00:22:03,218 --> 00:22:06,728
with the idea... The idea of love.

65
00:22:07,707 --> 00:22:11,964
Now, on that brave, profound note,
I'm gonna go and get some coffee.

66
00:22:12,151 --> 00:22:15,495
How you can be so fucking beautiful
and so fucking wrong?

67
00:22:31,137 --> 00:22:33,054
- What?
- You're running for the hills.

68
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:36,292
Yes, you are.

69
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:42,541
Oh, my God!

70
00:22:43,282 --> 00:22:44,282
I'm sorry.

71
00:23:07,858 --> 00:23:09,358
Calm down, girlie man.

72
00:23:09,832 --> 00:23:12,965
- It's not like I blew you or anything.
- Get off of me.

73
00:23:13,228 --> 00:23:16,734
Hey, I'm taking you up on your offer.
Read this and give me notes.

74
00:23:16,874 --> 00:23:19,334
- Now?
- Yeah. What else are you doing?

75
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:21,269
What happened last night?

76
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:23,681
Too drunk to drive? Too limp to fuck?

77
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:25,960
Does my father have anything
to worry about?

78
00:23:34,895 --> 00:23:36,075
You're up!

79
00:23:36,335 --> 00:23:39,334
- Good morning... to you.
- Have you seen Mia anywhere?

80
00:23:39,474 --> 00:23:40,824
No, who? Mia, no.

81
00:23:46,253 --> 00:23:49,714
- About last night...
- Let's not and say we did.

82
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:54,358
- You don't want to talk about it?
Not so much... Now.

83
00:23:55,031 --> 00:23:57,180
- That's fine.
- I'm just a little raw.

84
00:23:57,841 --> 00:23:59,491
It's too soon for me.

85
00:24:00,808 --> 00:24:03,094
Are you okay?
You're being kind of weird.

86
00:24:03,641 --> 00:24:05,313
- Do you feel...
- No, I'm good.

87
00:24:07,414 --> 00:24:09,705
Do you want me to get you some Advil?

88
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:15,458
- I'll put some coffee on.
- Thank you. You're too good to me.

89
00:24:17,388 --> 00:24:19,398
What about last night?

90
00:24:19,613 --> 00:24:22,872
- Does my father have to worry about?
- No more than usual.

91
00:24:28,685 --> 00:24:30,093
Oh, my god!

92
00:24:30,572 --> 00:24:31,881
You look so lame.

93
00:24:32,141 --> 00:24:35,534
Well, good, because that's exactly
the look that I'm going for.

94
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,367
- Have a seat.
- Don't mind if I do.

95
00:24:38,507 --> 00:24:41,357
- Coffee?
- For the love of God, yes.

96
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:42,841
Times?

97
00:24:43,212 --> 00:24:44,307
Boo-ya.

98
00:24:58,137 --> 00:24:59,137
What?

99
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:06,140
You eat pop-tarts?

100
00:25:06,926 --> 00:25:07,926
Pop-tarts?

101
00:25:09,713 --> 00:25:10,833
I don't mind much.

102
00:25:12,665 --> 00:25:13,804
I'll go for them.

103
00:25:14,165 --> 00:25:15,256
Yeah, we're good.

104
00:25:18,514 --> 00:25:20,388
I know. Yeah, we miss you, too.

105
00:25:21,305 --> 00:25:22,338
So much.

106
00:25:24,096 --> 00:25:25,791
When are you coming back?

107
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:31,605
I've got to go.

108
00:25:32,808 --> 00:25:34,300
I'll call you later.

109
00:25:38,308 --> 00:25:40,393
Yes, she's right here.

110
00:25:43,112 --> 00:25:44,112
What?

111
00:26:03,275 --> 00:26:05,083
<i>"Rome is burning," he said,</i>

112
00:26:05,288 --> 00:26:07,448
<i>as he poured himself another drink.</i>

113
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:10,634
<i>"Yet here I am,
knee-deep in a river of pussy."</i>

114
00:26:10,774 --> 00:26:12,385
<i>"Here it comes," she thought,</i>

115
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:14,918
<i>"another self-indulgent,
whiskey-soaked diatribe</i>

116
00:26:15,093 --> 00:26:17,828
<i>"about how fucking great
everything was in the past... "</i>

117
00:26:18,607 --> 00:26:23,135
<i>"And how all us poor souls born too late
to see the Stones at wherever</i>

118
00:26:23,275 --> 00:26:26,467
<i>"or snort the good coke
like they had at studio 54,</i>

119
00:26:26,607 --> 00:26:30,484
<i>"well, we had all just missed out on
practically everything worth living for."</i>

120
00:26:30,974 --> 00:26:33,536
<i>And the worst part was,
she agreed with him.</i>

121
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,922
I felt bad.

122
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:40,024
You were so nice to me,
and I totally took advantage.

123
00:26:43,707 --> 00:26:44,889
So...

124
00:26:46,433 --> 00:26:49,352
Do you want to get high
and listen to some records?

125
00:26:54,433 --> 00:26:56,781
By the way, my name is...

126
00:26:59,157 --> 00:27:01,113
<i>"Here we are," she thought,</i>

127
00:27:01,373 --> 00:27:05,217
<i>"at the edge of the world,
the very edge of western civilization,</i>

128
00:27:05,774 --> 00:27:09,024
<i>"and all of us are so desperate
to feel something,</i>

129
00:27:09,607 --> 00:27:12,288
<i>"anything, that we keep
falling into each other</i>

130
00:27:12,476 --> 00:27:15,325
<i>and fucking our way
towards the end of days."</i>
