<i>Previously on</i> Californication...

2
00:00:02,432 --> 00:00:03,432
So, Hank.

3
00:00:03,592 --> 00:00:06,101
- Meredith.
- Do I know any of your books ?

4
00:00:06,304 --> 00:00:08,676
Well, that depends on whether
or not you read, Meredith.

5
00:00:09,014 --> 00:00:12,132
The good people Hell-A
are very interested

6
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:15,742
in your thoughts.
They would like you to blog for them.

7
00:00:17,446 --> 00:00:19,306
Jesus H. Christ.

8
00:00:19,566 --> 00:00:21,809
- I am 16, you know.
- So I've been told.

9
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:24,120
- Hi, daddy !
- Honey, put some clothes on.

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,058
- We have company.
- Are you serious about marrying Bill?

11
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:30,220
- Yes. Why?
- What about Hank?

12
00:00:30,494 --> 00:00:32,118
Game on, broheme.

13
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:34,306
You want to get fucked up ?

14
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:37,951
Oh, God...

15
00:00:40,512 --> 00:00:42,295
- Must be weird, though.
- What ?

16
00:00:42,437 --> 00:00:44,018
Becoming the employee of a man

17
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,085
- you hate.
- What are you talking about ?

18
00:00:46,226 --> 00:00:48,934
My father, he owns <i>Hell-A Magazine</i>.

19
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:55,198
Subtitles: swsub.com (1.00)

20
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,744
Once upon a time, I wrote a book.

21
00:00:57,884 --> 00:01:01,309
People seemed to dig it,
so I wrote another and one after that.

22
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:04,254
That's when Hollywood came knocking
at my back door.

23
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:06,283
As soon as I cashed that check,

24
00:01:06,452 --> 00:01:09,680
I wrapped my lips around the mighty
erection that is the film industry

25
00:01:09,821 --> 00:01:12,577
and sucked hard,
just like a good whore should.

26
00:01:13,384 --> 00:01:15,996
Unfortunately, I had to be taught
not to orphan the balls.

27
00:01:16,136 --> 00:01:19,157
- Moody!
- Ladies and gentlemen, Todd Carr

28
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:21,746
the caramel-coated, chrome-domed auteur

29
00:01:21,886 --> 00:01:25,178
who took my precious little novel,
wiped his ass, and transformed it

30
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,671
into the craptastic crowd-pleaser
also known as

31
00:01:27,874 --> 00:01:29,719
<i>Crazy Little Thing Called Love.</i>

32
00:01:31,596 --> 00:01:32,691
My people.

33
00:01:32,934 --> 00:01:34,941
Still bitching about
being a whore to Hollywood?

34
00:01:35,144 --> 00:01:36,859
Only when my pimp's not around.

35
00:01:37,134 --> 00:01:38,983
You're no goddamn fucking Faulkner,
you know.

36
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:41,205
And you're no Brett fucking Ratner.

37
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:44,734
But that could be a compliment,
and in that case, I didn't mean to.

38
00:01:45,844 --> 00:01:48,088
I'm sick of you talking shit about me
in the press.

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,685
That's why you're here?

40
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:52,370
I thought you came after finding out
I fucked your wife

41
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,458
in almost
every room of your house.

42
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:57,374
Every room of your house.
And I'm sorry about the rug.

43
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,394
I didn't realize the old lady
was a squirter.

44
00:03:10,362 --> 00:03:11,362
Where's Karen ?

45
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:13,563
Home, with Becca.

46
00:03:13,823 --> 00:03:15,189
She's funny, that one.

47
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:17,016
Becca ? Yeah, she is a real character.

48
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:19,903
Karen. She knows how to push
all my buttons.

49
00:03:20,163 --> 00:03:22,364
I don't think she's trying
to push your buttons, Hank.

50
00:03:22,624 --> 00:03:26,353
Bill, I'm not really interested in what
you think, but thank you for sharing.

51
00:03:26,493 --> 00:03:27,902
I wanted to come.

52
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:29,229
You did?

53
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:30,509
I'm not the bad guy.

54
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:32,165
You're not the bad guy?

55
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:34,070
Life is complicated, man.

56
00:03:34,704 --> 00:03:37,623
"Life is complicated, man."
That's what you got ?

57
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:41,508
- Way to dip into the platitudes.
- I guess that's why you're the writer.

58
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:42,857
Oh, fuck.

59
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,748
I didn't ask you to fucking come bail me
out. I didn't ask for a fucking job.

60
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,534
Who the fuck do you think you are?

61
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:50,627
You think I love
to be in business with you ?

62
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:54,938
Some rude, disrespectful jackass
who can't get out of his own way ?

63
00:03:55,198 --> 00:03:56,693
You looking for a dick punch ?

64
00:03:57,053 --> 00:03:59,025
Do you want to punch me in the dick ?

65
00:03:59,316 --> 00:04:01,370
I kind of do, but standing here
talking about it

66
00:04:01,552 --> 00:04:04,489
- is beginning to sound kind of gay.
- Go ahead. Take a shot.

67
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:05,891
But think,

68
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:08,076
would you want Becca to see this ?

69
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,985
I'll settle for a titty twister.

70
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:15,472
God. You're 11.

71
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:17,559
Fuck...

72
00:04:17,804 --> 00:04:20,797
Keep the job, Hank.
Get back on your feet.

73
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:22,848
Get on with your life.

74
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:26,219
And forget about the woman
you didn't want to marry.

75
00:04:27,627 --> 00:04:30,801
Don't make me get up and kick your ass
all over again, Bill !

76
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:15,477
Hi. Remember me ?

77
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:19,634
How could I forget ?
Best blind date of my life, asshole.

78
00:05:20,031 --> 00:05:21,321
We don't have much time.

79
00:05:21,481 --> 00:05:23,914
Your suitor will be returning
from the shitter.

80
00:05:24,054 --> 00:05:26,076
I'd like to offer my sincere apologies.

81
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:27,864
My behavior the other night

82
00:05:28,018 --> 00:05:30,430
was beyond appalling,
despicable, reprehensible.

83
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,869
I was a mess. I have no words.

84
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:35,227
For a guy with no words,
that was a lot of words.

85
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:37,612
That's funny.

86
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:39,949
I wouldn't have expected that from you.

87
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:41,943
Because you had me so nailed.

88
00:05:43,707 --> 00:05:46,939
Well, let me make it up to you.
Can I... take you out sometime?

89
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:51,388
I'm out right now,
with a guy who's not an asshole.

90
00:05:51,648 --> 00:05:54,831
Right. Well, do you see yourself
marrying this fella ?

91
00:05:55,084 --> 00:05:57,238
- You never know.
- Girls know at once

92
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,711
whether they want to fuck,
marry, or kill a guy.

93
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:02,148
Which begs the question,
how am I doing ?

94
00:06:02,372 --> 00:06:03,372
Bye now.

95
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,320
Be good to her, my friend.

96
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,656
I had a shot with her once,
but I blew it.

97
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:12,409
Hang out with your wang out,
but remember

98
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,563
-- no gloving, no loving.

99
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:19,082
<i>Au revoir, mes enfants.</i>
<i>Au revoir.</i>

100
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,161
So... you were brought up
on the east coast.

101
00:06:32,586 --> 00:06:33,788
Jersey maybe.

102
00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:35,679
No, Long Island.

103
00:06:35,976 --> 00:06:38,449
Dad had a chip on his shoulder,
blue on his collar.

104
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:40,911
Mom was a little beat down by it all,
but she's the one

105
00:06:41,053 --> 00:06:42,667
who encouraged you to dream big.

106
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:44,261
They fought like cats and dogs,

107
00:06:44,423 --> 00:06:46,629
but they stayed together
through good times and bad.

108
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:49,636
You had sisters.
You learned about girls.

109
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:52,815
You were good with them,
maybe a little too good.

110
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:57,495
You read books, and you didn't want
to die 5 miles from where you were born.

111
00:06:57,729 --> 00:06:59,641
So you escaped into the city
you romanticized

112
00:06:59,824 --> 00:07:02,567
and reinvented yourself
as a poor man's McInerney.

113
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,322
How am I doing ?

114
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,552
Pretty good,
a lot more gracious than mine.

115
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:11,822
I blacked out there in the middle,

116
00:07:11,962 --> 00:07:15,215
when you were really strumming my pain
with your fingers, but...

117
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:16,384
well done.

118
00:07:17,023 --> 00:07:19,032
How long you been working on that ?

119
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:21,060
A couple of weeks.

120
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,644
It's a good story.

121
00:07:23,498 --> 00:07:24,871
Any idea how it ends ?

122
00:07:57,034 --> 00:07:59,717
- Hey, where are you going ?
- I have to get to work.

123
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,063
A job ? What do you do ?

124
00:08:02,526 --> 00:08:05,396
Well, don't you remember ?
I'm a poor gal's Martha Stewart.

125
00:08:05,824 --> 00:08:07,905
Don't you remember I'm an asshole ?

126
00:08:08,492 --> 00:08:10,568
Right. I'm an attorney.

127
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:12,139
Then we're both assholes.

128
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,609
- What's your thing ?
- Divorce.

129
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,683
You must be a busy girl.

130
00:08:18,527 --> 00:08:20,615
That I am,
which is why I have to skedaddle.

131
00:08:20,764 --> 00:08:22,669
I can't believe you tried
to slink out of here

132
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:25,975
- without saying goodbye to me.
- Hank. Please.

133
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:27,961
I assume this was a one-time thing.

134
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:30,630
Why would you assume
something like that ?

135
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:35,399
Sorry, but you don't seem like a guy

136
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,175
who likes a lot of repeat business.

137
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:39,361
I'm offended. How about tonight ?

138
00:08:39,661 --> 00:08:41,180
- Are you sure?
- Yeah,

139
00:08:41,443 --> 00:08:43,603
a proper date. Dinner.

140
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,500
20th-century style.

141
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,661
I'd be just as happy to come back here.

142
00:08:47,955 --> 00:08:49,690
No. Dinner.

143
00:08:50,454 --> 00:08:52,158
A girl's got to eat.

144
00:08:57,628 --> 00:08:59,074
That she does.

145
00:09:22,022 --> 00:09:23,294
Are you gonna flush?

146
00:09:25,275 --> 00:09:27,210
What the fuck are you doing here?

147
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,812
The redhead let me in.

148
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:33,138
Question: does the carpet
match the drapes, Hanky-panky?

149
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,680
You scared the shit outta me.

150
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:37,171
I know.
You screamed just like a little girl.

151
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,067
- Kind of a turnoff, actually.
- What the fuck do you want?

152
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:41,599
I'm late...

153
00:09:41,744 --> 00:09:43,476
What? That's not possible.

154
00:09:44,497 --> 00:09:46,037
I... wore a condom.

155
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,378
That's... That would be like
the Immaculate Conception.

156
00:09:49,642 --> 00:09:52,794
And you, you're the one who...
and then you left.

157
00:09:53,056 --> 00:09:54,547
I'm late for school.

158
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,719
Well, then, what do you want from me,
besides the obvious?

159
00:10:00,981 --> 00:10:02,608
Don't flatter yourself, champ.

160
00:10:02,775 --> 00:10:04,560
I have a creative-writing course,

161
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,454
and I need
to turn something in today, so....

162
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,249
Okay, what's the problem?
It's creative writing.

163
00:10:10,728 --> 00:10:12,628
Be creative.
Write something.

164
00:10:12,837 --> 00:10:16,062
This from a guy who hasn't written
a word in five years?

165
00:10:16,245 --> 00:10:17,590
Nobody likes a smartass.

166
00:10:17,768 --> 00:10:20,309
Come on, you must have
some piece-of-shit short story

167
00:10:20,492 --> 00:10:23,250
- you never published around, somewhere.
- No, nothing.

168
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:27,125
Don't. Stop that!

169
00:10:27,364 --> 00:10:28,399
And don't move.

170
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,178
Don't fuck around.

171
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:31,857
Do not fuck around!

172
00:10:32,982 --> 00:10:34,159
It's not funny.

173
00:10:38,925 --> 00:10:40,050
Look who's here.

174
00:10:40,316 --> 00:10:42,113
You don't call, thanks,
you don't write.

175
00:10:43,154 --> 00:10:44,444
You look like shit.

176
00:10:44,586 --> 00:10:47,211
And you look beautiful...
Far too beautiful for these 4 walls.

177
00:10:47,353 --> 00:10:48,887
Let's get some breakfast.
Come on.

178
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,920
- I'm getting coffee.
- No, we'll go out.

179
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:52,493
- We'll get it.
- Get dressed.

180
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:53,753
Fuck!

181
00:10:59,738 --> 00:11:01,165
I just wanted...

182
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:05,454
What, no points for safety?

183
00:11:05,633 --> 00:11:08,007
Yes, but Magnums?

184
00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:10,416
- Well, you know.
- Did you have a growth spurt?

185
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:12,607
Well, no, I been... working out.

186
00:11:13,474 --> 00:11:15,319
Just a lot of vitamins.
I got whole...

187
00:11:15,944 --> 00:11:16,996
I got a regimen.

188
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:20,690
Hank, do not quit this job.

189
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,540
It's hardly a job, Karen.

190
00:11:22,953 --> 00:11:23,981
It's a blog.

191
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:26,486
It's the best thing
that's happened to you in a long time

192
00:11:26,628 --> 00:11:29,605
- and you're good at it.
- Well, I just can't work for Bill.

193
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:30,786
Why not?

194
00:11:31,415 --> 00:11:32,927
Well, for one, he's a dick.

195
00:11:33,362 --> 00:11:35,355
Could you just swallow your...

196
00:11:35,631 --> 00:11:37,613
stupid pride and keep the job,

197
00:11:37,842 --> 00:11:40,709
keep writing, keep doing
what you were put on this planet to do?

198
00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:44,275
What else is there for you... besides
drowning in a sea of pointless pussy?

199
00:11:49,438 --> 00:11:50,701
It's the neighbors.

200
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:54,566
Do you know what?
I should go in there.

201
00:11:54,706 --> 00:11:55,950
I'm gonna go in there.

202
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:59,492
I'm gonna go in there and tell her
what to expect and how to treat it.

203
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:01,795
- It's only fair.
- There are some...

204
00:12:02,086 --> 00:12:05,439
images you don't want floating around
your pretty little head.

205
00:12:05,678 --> 00:12:07,514
Trust me, it's like a...

206
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:10,669
It's like a Mapplethorpe shoot in there,
except with less cock.

207
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:12,650
Shut up, okay?

208
00:12:12,953 --> 00:12:14,295
Shut up.

209
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:20,362
Keep the job, hank.

210
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:22,164
Do it for becca's sake.

211
00:12:22,621 --> 00:12:24,621
Give her something to look up to.

212
00:12:30,524 --> 00:12:31,940
Thanks for stopping by.

213
00:12:50,001 --> 00:12:53,044
Just suppose you're a guy,
you're getting a massage from another guy,

214
00:12:53,184 --> 00:12:55,010
and it's nice, it's relaxing.

215
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:57,552
Then all of a sudden,
you get a little tingle,

216
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,427
a little unintentional stim.

217
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:03,200
What do you call that,
where you get a little turgidity?

218
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,541
You get a rollover going there.

219
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:07,260
That was Nora from <i>Hell-A Magazine</i>.

220
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,290
She wanna know
when she'll get the next piece.

221
00:13:09,432 --> 00:13:11,289
What would you call that phenomenon?

222
00:13:11,717 --> 00:13:13,745
Hank, the whole idea behind the blog

223
00:13:14,007 --> 00:13:16,513
is an ongoing narrative.
You understand?

224
00:13:16,653 --> 00:13:19,542
A series of events
that follows another series of events.

225
00:13:19,807 --> 00:13:21,337
I get that. I really do.

226
00:13:21,477 --> 00:13:23,821
I just can't whore myself out to the tall man anymore.

227
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,624
Ongoing or not, I can't do it.
<i>Capisce</i>?

228
00:13:27,051 --> 00:13:28,843
With all due respect, Hank,

229
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:31,182
grow the fuck up already. Would you?

230
00:13:31,324 --> 00:13:33,351
Come on! You're the lying cocksucker
that got me

231
00:13:33,492 --> 00:13:35,662
into this in the first place.
You set me up.

232
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,296
If by set you up, you mean

233
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:40,034
contrive a situation
in which you might actually start

234
00:13:40,174 --> 00:13:42,845
to produce words again,
then, yes, okay, guilty as charged.

235
00:13:42,985 --> 00:13:45,484
You should've told me
what you were up to in the first place.

236
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,925
- That was bullshit.
- You wouldn't have done it!

237
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,198
Okay, you see what I'm getting at here?

238
00:13:50,464 --> 00:13:52,078
Oh, fuck you.
You're fired.

239
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,338
You know that you've fired me

240
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,412
roughly every 90 days
since we worked together.

241
00:13:57,552 --> 00:13:59,974
Yeah, because
I'm a consistent motherfucker.

242
00:14:00,795 --> 00:14:03,218
Don't do this, hank, okay?
Not now.

243
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,314
No other agent in their right mind
would take you on, now.

244
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:09,558
And the ones who would wouldn't be able
to get you a job writing kiddy porn.

245
00:14:09,762 --> 00:14:11,894
Yeah, we'll see about that.
It's a broner.

246
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,562
It's a broner...
The word I'm looking for.

247
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:17,409
Unintentionally man-inspired boner...
Broner.

248
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:18,904
Duly noted.

249
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:24,788
Broner!

250
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:26,530
What is so fucking difficult

251
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,028
about distinguishing
diet from regular, huh?

252
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,571
Here. Just go.

253
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:33,181
You're fired, all right?
Get out. Go!

254
00:14:33,461 --> 00:14:35,204
Fucking get outta here.

255
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:44,483
You okay there, tiger?

256
00:14:46,851 --> 00:14:50,145
Did you ever have one of those days
where you feel like a tired, old whore

257
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,807
whose uterus is about to fall out?

258
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:55,106
I think I'm in touch with that emotion.

259
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,533
Really? I was just being dramatic.
Do tell.

260
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:01,612
That guy you saw me with last night?

261
00:15:01,978 --> 00:15:03,032
He's married.

262
00:15:03,172 --> 00:15:05,307
Oh, you dirty cheater, you.

263
00:15:05,885 --> 00:15:06,885
Five years.

264
00:15:07,271 --> 00:15:09,544
Been fucking a married guy
for five years?

265
00:15:09,854 --> 00:15:10,854
Classy, huh?

266
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,883
I tend to think of myself

267
00:15:14,023 --> 00:15:16,828
as a whatever-makes-you-happy
kind of a guy, but...

268
00:15:17,178 --> 00:15:19,748
I have to ask...
What's in it for you, lady?

269
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:22,021
I love him.

270
00:15:23,076 --> 00:15:25,348
And I tend to believe him
when he says he loves me.

271
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:28,504
That sounds like
a charming little romcom,

272
00:15:29,234 --> 00:15:31,591
except for the part
where he won't leave his wife.

273
00:15:32,294 --> 00:15:35,152
The guy's richer than god.
He doesn't want to cut it in half.

274
00:15:35,464 --> 00:15:36,915
I haven't known you very long,

275
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,734
and this probably means precious little
coming from a guy

276
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:42,658
who treated you like
a piece of prison ass on a blind date,

277
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,059
but I think you deserve
a hell of a lot more.

278
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:51,581
My baby.

279
00:15:52,862 --> 00:15:55,717
You have a baby with the married guy?
Holy fuck.

280
00:15:57,518 --> 00:15:58,758
A dog.

281
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:00,844
Cat Stevens.

282
00:16:01,713 --> 00:16:03,947
You have a dog named Cat Stevens?

283
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:05,830
Holy fuck!

284
00:16:09,194 --> 00:16:10,772
A gift from married guy.

285
00:16:12,143 --> 00:16:14,222
I know it sounds incredibly lame,

286
00:16:14,914 --> 00:16:16,303
but he was like our baby.

287
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:19,853
The one thing that was ours...
Just ours.

288
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,744
So, his wife goes out of town,

289
00:16:22,886 --> 00:16:25,273
and I bring Cat Stevens
over to the house.

290
00:16:25,878 --> 00:16:27,957
Naturally, the bitch comes home early.

291
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:31,735
I barely have enough time to put on
my clothes and sneak out the back.

292
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,518
And then I realized I left him behind.

293
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:39,805
That fucking bitch thought sweet
little Cat Stevens was a gift for her.

294
00:16:40,573 --> 00:16:42,620
Married guy doesn't say anything?

295
00:16:43,181 --> 00:16:44,473
How could he?

296
00:16:44,746 --> 00:16:46,232
Hmm, that is sick.

297
00:16:46,552 --> 00:16:47,552
Come on.

298
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:49,330
Where are we going?

299
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:51,292
We're gonna fix this.

300
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:21,182
Hey, honey.

301
00:18:32,723 --> 00:18:33,996
You're insane.

302
00:18:34,838 --> 00:18:36,926
You've been fucking
a married guy for 5 years,

303
00:18:37,086 --> 00:18:39,482
you've got a dog named Cat Stevens,
and I'm insane?

304
00:18:39,622 --> 00:18:40,622
Point taken.

305
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:44,272
I got to figure out a way to get
in there without breaking a window.

306
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,097
How about this?

307
00:18:59,141 --> 00:19:00,141
Cat?

308
00:19:04,245 --> 00:19:06,529
<i>And you'll never have dried-up meat
in the fridge.</i>

309
00:19:08,407 --> 00:19:09,839
Cat Stevens!

310
00:19:10,538 --> 00:19:11,803
Come here, Cat!

311
00:19:11,945 --> 00:19:13,701
<i>Roast beef, lamb, turkey.</i>

312
00:19:13,892 --> 00:19:16,314
<i>This knife is like a hot knife
going right through butter.</i>

313
00:19:16,873 --> 00:19:18,375
<i>It has a fork with the end,</i>

314
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:21,047
<i>so you pick up the meat,
dip it into the gravy.</i>

315
00:19:21,187 --> 00:19:23,524
<i>Remember, here's a grapefruit.
Look at this.</i>

316
00:19:24,123 --> 00:19:26,108
<i>Not a seed, not a drop of juice
comes out.</i>

317
00:19:26,754 --> 00:19:28,022
Come here.

318
00:19:28,718 --> 00:19:30,340
I'll take you away from all this!

319
00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:35,012
Cat! Yusuf Islam!

320
00:19:37,256 --> 00:19:38,923
<i>Be Straight</i> is a good song.

321
00:19:39,063 --> 00:19:42,213
Come here, Cat.
Come here!
Come on!

322
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,109
Don't worry, I'll be gone
in a few minutes.

323
00:20:13,704 --> 00:20:15,660
Actually, I was... I was...

324
00:20:17,644 --> 00:20:20,479
- I was gonna call you.
- You could've e-mailed.

325
00:20:22,726 --> 00:20:24,857
I think I overreacted yesterday,

326
00:20:25,073 --> 00:20:27,073
and I'm sorry about that,

327
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,549
So,

328
00:20:29,413 --> 00:20:33,019
the job is yours if...
you still want it.

329
00:20:33,936 --> 00:20:35,137
I want it.

330
00:20:36,064 --> 00:20:37,143
Good.

331
00:20:38,814 --> 00:20:39,814
But...

332
00:20:40,562 --> 00:20:41,562
But?

333
00:20:43,064 --> 00:20:46,653
From now on, if I make a mistake
or I screw something up,

334
00:20:47,624 --> 00:20:51,551
you should feel free to discipline
me in whatever way you see fit.

335
00:20:52,315 --> 00:20:53,665
You're the boss.

336
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:01,202
And, Hank called.

337
00:21:02,065 --> 00:21:04,422
He said you could still be his agent
if you want.

338
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:24,908
I thought that was you.

339
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,110
I would have focused
on a different area altogether.

340
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,917
Get your ass back in bed then.

341
00:21:30,315 --> 00:21:31,580
I got to go to work.

342
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,455
Ah, yes, I don't think I've ever dated
a woman who had a job before.

343
00:21:37,315 --> 00:21:39,775
Is that what we're doing? Dating?

344
00:21:41,161 --> 00:21:43,529
It does feel that way, kind of,

345
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:47,029
sort of, maybe, a little bit.

346
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,327
Yeah. I guess it kind of does.

347
00:21:52,158 --> 00:21:53,665
Too many tongues!

348
00:21:56,876 --> 00:21:58,172
Take your fucking dog!

349
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:02,690
I didn't have the heart to tell you,
but that's not Cat Stevens.

350
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,950
What?

351
00:22:04,251 --> 00:22:07,843
You took the wrong dog. So not
your fault, the bitch has a lot of them.

352
00:22:08,229 --> 00:22:09,626
Look on the bright side.

353
00:22:10,143 --> 00:22:11,484
He seems to really like you.

354
00:22:19,391 --> 00:22:20,569
Thank you.

355
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,970
This is not a macchiato!

356
00:22:26,308 --> 00:22:27,848
A macchiato...

357
00:22:34,534 --> 00:22:35,905
What...

358
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:37,912
am I going to do with you?

359
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,127
Whatever you want, boss.

360
00:22:52,543 --> 00:22:53,950
Look what a mess I've made.

361
00:23:29,995 --> 00:23:31,046
Guess who.

362
00:23:31,668 --> 00:23:34,842
Something's familiar.
Did you switch to Camel lights?

363
00:23:34,982 --> 00:23:36,089
That's cute!

364
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:37,613
What you reading?

365
00:23:37,753 --> 00:23:41,337
Oh, you're not gonna go through
with that barbaric ritual, are you?

366
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,427
I was thinking about it.

367
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:45,028
You don't sound too excited.

368
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,170
I am.

369
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,830
It's just weird.

370
00:23:48,356 --> 00:23:50,467
I never thought I'd get married.

371
00:23:50,607 --> 00:23:53,030
You had me convinced
it was all a bullshit fairy tale.

372
00:23:53,218 --> 00:23:55,803
- And it's not?
- Not if you meet the right person.

373
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,216
You say it's about meeting Mr. Right.

374
00:23:58,356 --> 00:24:00,767
I think you're settling
for Mr. Right in front of you.

375
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:05,124
I'm asking you to consider
Mr. Lurking right above you.

376
00:24:08,444 --> 00:24:12,570
I wouldn't want to erase the fact that,
once upon a time, I used to love you.

377
00:24:16,302 --> 00:24:18,764
William. I have something for you.

378
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,715
Hank! You didn't have to do this!

379
00:24:23,857 --> 00:24:27,103
Considering I got my precious
bodily fluids all over yours,

380
00:24:27,356 --> 00:24:29,069
I felt like, yeah, I kind of did.

381
00:24:29,495 --> 00:24:35,129
But that piece of... art
is worth a small fortune.

382
00:24:35,297 --> 00:24:38,153
Don't look a gift piece
of overpriced pop art in the mouth.

383
00:24:38,295 --> 00:24:40,808
I know people who know people.
Just enjoy it.

384
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:43,822
Consider it a belated
engagement present.

385
00:24:44,171 --> 00:24:46,157
Hang it over your marital bed.

386
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:48,160
What's up with you?

387
00:24:48,357 --> 00:24:50,607
- You seem kind of...
- Jaunty?

388
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:52,219
- Yes.
- Devil-may-care?

389
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,654
- Yes.
- Happy?

390
00:24:54,232 --> 00:24:56,234
- Even.
- Well, maybe I met a girl.

391
00:24:56,374 --> 00:24:57,819
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, honey.

392
00:24:58,376 --> 00:25:01,649
I've got something for you, too.
Just hold on. Stay right there.

393
00:25:05,586 --> 00:25:08,611
I'm partial to Yusuf Islam,
but you can call him whatever you want.

394
00:25:09,794 --> 00:25:11,879
And, Bill, don't worry.
He can stay with me.

395
00:25:12,181 --> 00:25:15,943
- That's so nice of you, Hank.
- Yes, Hank, that's very nice of you.

396
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:20,405
Well, you guys look like one big happy.

397
00:25:20,545 --> 00:25:23,455
I am proud to report
that my daughter has just penned

398
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:27,078
one of the most impressive short stories
I've ever had the pleasure of reading.

399
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,714
Now, the prose was a bit
on the purple side,

400
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:33,581
but still, I had no idea
she had it in her.

401
00:25:33,723 --> 00:25:35,245
The prose couldn't be that purple.

402
00:25:35,393 --> 00:25:38,719
No, it was, but still,
it was good stuff.

403
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,784
That is something.

404
00:25:41,588 --> 00:25:42,903
Well, it's what I do.

405
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,358
Speaking of which,

406
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:46,489
dare I ask about the blog?

407
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:50,435
Honey, to quote The Clash,

408
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:53,451
<i>should I stay
or should I rock the Kasbah</i>?

409
00:25:54,037 --> 00:25:56,856
Do what you want, dad.
I love you no matter what.

410
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:03,212
<i>Good morning, Hell-A.</i>

411
00:26:03,352 --> 00:26:06,575
<i>In the land of the lotus-eaters,
time plays tricks on you.</i>

412
00:26:07,225 --> 00:26:08,459
<i>One day you're dreaming.</i>

413
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:11,105
<i>The next, your dream
has become your reality.</i>

414
00:26:13,098 --> 00:26:14,487
<i>It was the best of times.</i>

415
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:17,149
<i>If only someone had told me.</i>

416
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,501
<i>Mistakes were made, hearts
were broken,
harsh lessons learned.</i>

417
00:26:24,226 --> 00:26:25,910
<i>My family goes on without me,</i>

418
00:26:27,131 --> 00:26:30,591
<i>while I drown
in a sea of pointless pussy.</i>

419
00:26:32,989 --> 00:26:34,591
<i>I don't know how I got here.</i>

420
00:26:35,787 --> 00:26:40,216
<i>But here I am, rotting away
in the warm California sun.</i>

421
00:26:41,477 --> 00:26:45,274
<i>There are things I need to figure out,
for her sake, at least.</i>

422
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:49,810
<i>The clock is ticking.
The gap is widening.</i>

423
00:26:52,943 --> 00:26:55,399
<i>She won't always love me
"no matter what."</i>
