1
00:00:34,269 --> 00:00:35,225
Nice planes.

2
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:37,972
Yeah, every aircraft
we operate is augmented

3
00:00:37,973 --> 00:00:40,014
with custom security
and design features

4
00:00:40,015 --> 00:00:41,943
you won't find
in any other fleet.

5
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:48,601
I see that you're
an Embry-Riddle grad.

6
00:00:48,736 --> 00:00:52,479
ATP-certified,
1,600 verified FAA hours.

7
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:54,447
Clearly well qualified,
Mr. Green.

8
00:00:54,582 --> 00:00:55,836
Flying's in my blood.

9
00:00:56,048 --> 00:00:58,826
I started working on my Grandpa's
crop duster when I was 10.

10
00:00:59,113 --> 00:01:00,559
Now you understand
that we charter

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,245
exclusively
to top executives

12
00:01:02,246 --> 00:01:04,726
and celebrity clients,
so absolute discretion

13
00:01:04,727 --> 00:01:06,154
is a must for our flight crew.

14
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,941
Hey, anything past
getting the plane

15
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,135
safely from "A to "B"

16
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:10,223
is none of my business.

17
00:01:10,224 --> 00:01:12,133
Good, of course, finding
out everything we can

18
00:01:12,134 --> 00:01:14,690
about the people who are piloting
our planes is our business.

19
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:16,148
And according
to your visa records,

20
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:18,925
you spent a little time in the
Middle East over the last few years.

21
00:01:18,926 --> 00:01:20,875
14 months in Afghanistan, 6 in Iraq.

22
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:22,499
But you were never military?

23
00:01:22,963 --> 00:01:24,777
I worked for an
independent contractor.

24
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,436
Left that off the resum.

25
00:01:26,522 --> 00:01:27,806
I didn't think
it was relevant.

26
00:01:28,143 --> 00:01:30,814
State Department has you
flagged as a person of interest.

27
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:32,310
I'm an interesting guy.

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,824
There was an incident.

29
00:01:37,557 --> 00:01:39,525
I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

30
00:01:39,555 --> 00:01:41,185
Which contractor
were you working with

31
00:01:41,186 --> 00:01:42,738
when this
incident occurred?

32
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:43,798
One of the big ones.

33
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:46,547
- Halliburton, Blackwater?
- You said discretion was a must.

34
00:01:48,613 --> 00:01:51,776
Look, I'm going to be straight with you.
I think there's room in our operation

35
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:53,484
for someone like you,
but there is no way

36
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:55,889
that I can hire you if you
are unable to clear this up.

37
00:01:57,085 --> 00:01:58,223
Do you understand that?

38
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:02,969
Thank you for your time.

39
00:02:16,087 --> 00:02:18,923
<i>The president is scheduled
to address the nation tomorrow</i>

40
00:02:18,924 --> 00:02:20,331
<i>amid growing disapproval.</i>

41
00:02:20,582 --> 00:02:23,322
<i>Recent polls show his rating
plunging double digits</i>

42
00:02:23,323 --> 00:02:25,887
<i>into the 20s,
even amongst partisan voters.</i>

43
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:28,299
<i>With midterm elections
on the horizon,</i>

44
00:02:28,468 --> 00:02:30,768
<i>this is not a good sign
for the administration.</i>

45
00:02:36,737 --> 00:02:38,763
I've already been
summoned, Sarah.

46
00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:41,483
They want me in position.

47
00:02:41,984 --> 00:02:43,258
This is good news.

48
00:02:45,322 --> 00:02:47,464
We talking locally
or back to the farmland?

49
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,718
I'm waiting to hear.

50
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:51,593
Congratulations.

51
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:56,377
It was your idea.

52
00:02:58,316 --> 00:02:59,686
I have to say that...

53
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:01,557
when they recruited me,

54
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:04,162
I thought I was prepared
for just about anything.

55
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,814
But nothing like this.

56
00:03:08,778 --> 00:03:10,881
Well, that's because
nothing like this...

57
00:03:11,074 --> 00:03:12,849
has ever happened before.

58
00:03:19,138 --> 00:03:20,218
This is it.

59
00:03:23,865 --> 00:03:24,694
Yes.

60
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,605
This is the moment
we've prepared for.

61
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,094
All the devices
have been secured.

62
00:03:48,444 --> 00:03:51,454
The other cells are receiving
their instructions as we speak.

63
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:54,445
The target cities
have been confirmed.

64
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:58,274
Your routes have been scouted
and cleared.

65
00:04:00,378 --> 00:04:01,342
We're ready.

66
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:05,489
The strike will go off tomorrow
at precisely 8:05 Eastern.

67
00:04:07,082 --> 00:04:08,625
Take a look around you,
gentlemen.

68
00:04:12,858 --> 00:04:15,636
These are the faces of the men
who will change the world.

[ www.seriessub.com ]

72
00:04:53,408 --> 00:04:55,241
- Hey, Dad, you got a second?
- Nope.

73
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:56,832
USA Today's having a contest

74
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,185
to find the top five
towns under 5,000.

75
00:04:59,186 --> 00:05:01,095
I was thinking we
should submit Jericho.

76
00:05:01,096 --> 00:05:03,403
Why, so some big
developer can come in

77
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:04,648
and start buying
the town up,

78
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:07,111
maybe turn Main Street
into a strip mall

79
00:05:07,112 --> 00:05:08,844
with a half a dozen
coffee shops or so?

80
00:05:08,845 --> 00:05:10,530
Dad, there are worse things in the world

81
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:12,328
- than vente frappuccinos.
- Speak English.

82
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:13,756
This could be a good thing.

83
00:05:13,891 --> 00:05:16,514
The kind of headlines
that will bring out voters next month.

84
00:05:16,996 --> 00:05:20,064
Son, I am not worried
about beating Gray Anderson.

85
00:05:20,315 --> 00:05:21,259
The people of this town

86
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,035
have kept me in office
for over 20 years.

87
00:05:23,036 --> 00:05:24,365
I will earn their votes

88
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,526
by doing the job
they hired me to do.

89
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:29,015
What are you guys doing here?

90
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:31,349
Your father missed
his checkup this morning

91
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,240
and April was nice enough

92
00:05:33,241 --> 00:05:34,716
to take off
her lunch hour

93
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,201
to make a house call.

94
00:05:36,317 --> 00:05:38,555
Well, sorry, Doc, but we're
gonna have to reschedule

95
00:05:38,556 --> 00:05:40,868
- for sometime after the election.
- Johnston.

96
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:43,493
You're gonna do this
whether you like it or not.

97
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,460
I've had this terrible cold

98
00:05:45,537 --> 00:05:47,775
and you've not been feeling
well for almost a week.

99
00:05:47,852 --> 00:05:48,836
It's a bad one.

100
00:05:48,926 --> 00:05:50,604
Half my staff
has come down with it.

101
00:05:53,517 --> 00:05:55,022
Do you want to strip here

102
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:57,395
or would you like to go
somewhere a little less public?

103
00:05:58,105 --> 00:05:59,109
My office.

104
00:05:59,471 --> 00:06:00,937
That's my guy.

105
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:15,002
Yo, yo, how'd it go?

106
00:06:15,176 --> 00:06:16,102
Well, Freddy...

107
00:06:16,103 --> 00:06:17,799
so much for your lucky tie.

108
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:22,198
"Driver wanted.
Military experience.

109
00:06:22,352 --> 00:06:23,538
Plus, travel opportunities."

110
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:25,890
Something tells me they're not
talking about the Bahamas.

111
00:06:25,891 --> 00:06:26,683
I need a job.

112
00:06:27,605 --> 00:06:28,975
You're no driver, man.

113
00:06:29,284 --> 00:06:31,059
You're a pilot,
a freakin' good one.

114
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:33,703
Right now, all I am is broke.

115
00:06:34,706 --> 00:06:36,481
Unless you want
to pay my rent for me.

116
00:06:37,068 --> 00:06:37,801
Sorry?!

117
00:06:38,071 --> 00:06:39,460
Tell you what I can do, though.

118
00:06:39,518 --> 00:06:40,715
Set you up with a drink.

119
00:06:41,796 --> 00:06:42,915
Oye! Mira!

120
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:46,985
Hit us up with a couple
of cervezas.

121
00:06:46,986 --> 00:06:48,471
What's up with you
and the manners?

122
00:06:48,472 --> 00:06:50,651
I know you didn't just whistle
for me like some dog.

123
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,484
- Oh, baby...
- Don't you "baby" me, baby.

124
00:06:52,485 --> 00:06:53,853
You're the worst
tipper in here.

125
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,071
What, that ring on your finger,
that don't count?

126
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,265
Finally pulled
the trigger, Freddy?

127
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,368
- All right.
- You know it, baby.

128
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:09,342
Hey, she's got some
good-looking sisters.

129
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:12,910
Unless you're still all hung up
on that farm girl back in Iowa.

130
00:07:12,968 --> 00:07:14,125
- Kansas.
- Same thing.

131
00:07:14,126 --> 00:07:15,322
No, not the same thing.

132
00:07:20,954 --> 00:07:22,517
Yeah. Hold on a second.

133
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:23,945
Don't go anywhere,
all right?

134
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:27,445
Where am I gonna go?

135
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:44,365
<i>Sarah, the schedule's changed.</i>

136
00:07:44,617 --> 00:07:46,958
It's happening tomorrow
during the President's address.

137
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,241
<i>I'll be there as soon as I can,</i>

138
00:07:48,242 --> 00:07:50,083
but there's something
I need to take care of.

139
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:52,864
You get everything together
and I'll meet you back as soon as I can.

140
00:07:52,865 --> 00:07:53,709
Where are you going?

141
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:55,041
<i>To get my kids.</i>

142
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:57,269
<i>Robert, there isn't enough time.</i>

143
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:59,602
Robert!

144
00:08:13,395 --> 00:08:14,129
Anna.

145
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,546
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

146
00:08:18,547 --> 00:08:19,395
He's a good man.

147
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,111
I don't know
how good he his, but...

148
00:08:21,112 --> 00:08:22,520
he promised to take care of me.

149
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:25,501
- Call me crazy, I believe him.
- What's this?

150
00:08:25,674 --> 00:08:27,391
My best man hitting
on my fiance?

151
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:28,461
Best man?

152
00:08:28,732 --> 00:08:29,947
You gonna make me ask?

153
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,919
You're more a brother to me
than the one I grew up with.

154
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,574
Back at ya.

155
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:34,768
I'm happy to do it.

156
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:36,871
Got some more good news, too.

157
00:08:39,047 --> 00:08:40,263
Uh, sweetie, will you...

158
00:08:40,726 --> 00:08:42,385
will you give us
a moment to talk?

159
00:08:51,723 --> 00:08:53,749
What if I told you
I got a gig lined up?

160
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,836
Eight weeks,
a hundred G's, all cash.

161
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:57,800
What kind of gig?

162
00:08:57,974 --> 00:08:58,900
The kind we're good at.

163
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:00,945
Cargo run.
Quick in, quick out.

164
00:09:00,946 --> 00:09:02,952
$30,000 up front,
$70,000 when it's done.

165
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:04,707
Where?

166
00:09:05,884 --> 00:09:06,945
Afghanistan.

167
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,727
- No.
- Come on.

168
00:09:11,248 --> 00:09:13,428
You've been looking
for work for what, six months?

169
00:09:13,843 --> 00:09:16,217
We do this one gig
and we are set.

170
00:09:16,218 --> 00:09:19,126
You could open that flight school.
Maybe go home, snag back that girl.

171
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:20,592
Why are you doing this to me?

172
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:22,830
I can't believe you'd even ask

173
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:24,566
after what we saw over there,
what we did.

174
00:09:24,567 --> 00:09:26,534
All we did was
not get killed, J.

175
00:09:26,535 --> 00:09:28,078
Innocent people died, Freddy.

176
00:09:28,386 --> 00:09:29,351
Innocent people.

177
00:09:30,008 --> 00:09:31,648
I see it every time
I close my eyes.

178
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:33,287
Which isn't too damn often
these days.

179
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:35,454
Well, we'll be smarter
this time, man.

180
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:37,183
You know that I got
your back, man.

181
00:09:37,187 --> 00:09:38,287
I'm sorry.

182
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:42,155
You're on your own this time.
I can't go back there.

183
00:09:47,132 --> 00:09:48,183
I'll tell you what, Jerry,

184
00:09:48,184 --> 00:09:49,881
you agree
to sit down face to face,

185
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:52,157
I'll flip you a pair of
open day boxes at Wrigley.

186
00:09:53,103 --> 00:09:54,106
No strings.

187
00:09:54,453 --> 00:09:56,074
I swear on a stack
of cheddar dogs.

188
00:09:57,752 --> 00:09:58,273
Great.

189
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:00,511
6:00 at The Pump Room.

190
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:01,880
See you there.

191
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:05,103
Chicago again?

192
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,994
Hey, teach, half day?

193
00:10:08,151 --> 00:10:10,544
Feel like helping me
prepare a syllabus or...

194
00:10:10,582 --> 00:10:13,090
grading 30 essays on
Orwell's Animal Farm?

195
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,290
No, I have a better idea.

196
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:18,068
Have a sub do that and come
to Chicago with me tonight.

197
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:20,711
That would send
a great message to my students.

198
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:22,408
I'll write a letter for you.

199
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:25,321
"Dear kids, sorry I can't teach
you ungrateful brats today.

200
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:28,766
"I'm with my fiance getting drunk
on draft beer and having

201
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:31,293
tons of Chicago-style sex."

202
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,685
I think it's Chicago-style pizza.

203
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:35,904
That, too.

204
00:10:38,064 --> 00:10:39,048
One night.

205
00:10:39,145 --> 00:10:40,688
Your students will catch up.

206
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,020
Book it.

207
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:49,563
Seriously?

208
00:10:50,132 --> 00:10:52,562
You're not going to try
to talk me out of it now, are you?

209
00:10:53,662 --> 00:10:54,964
No. I'm done talking.

210
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,047
<i>46 tackles, three sacks</i>

211
00:11:00,048 --> 00:11:01,591
<i>and a couple of interceptions...</i>

212
00:11:21,353 --> 00:11:21,990
You all right?

213
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:26,408
I'm worried
about Freddy.

214
00:11:26,717 --> 00:11:27,875
You want a beer?

215
00:11:28,265 --> 00:11:28,844
No.

216
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:31,622
I think he's in over
his head with something.

217
00:11:33,123 --> 00:11:34,377
What are you talking about?

218
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:36,846
These guys started
coming around.

219
00:11:37,618 --> 00:11:38,293
Like...

220
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:39,972
soldiers but not.

221
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:42,247
They, they came by
again after you left.

222
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:43,810
Well, he's a big boy.

223
00:11:43,944 --> 00:11:45,603
He can hang out
with whoever he chooses.

224
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:46,510
It's not like that.

225
00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:47,818
When he came back,

226
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:50,301
Freddy had a black eye, saying
he's going away for two months

227
00:11:50,302 --> 00:11:51,387
and not to try to find him.

228
00:11:51,388 --> 00:11:52,780
Tell him you don't want him to go.

229
00:11:52,781 --> 00:11:53,903
You don't think I did that?

230
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:55,686
He says he doesn't
have a choice,

231
00:11:55,687 --> 00:11:56,887
that he's doing it for me.

232
00:11:57,261 --> 00:11:58,709
What do you want me to do?

233
00:11:59,498 --> 00:12:00,250
Help him.

234
00:12:02,532 --> 00:12:04,207
Go with him if you have to.

235
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:08,576
I know what he did for you
in Iraq.

236
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:12,200
I know you owe him your life.

237
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:15,297
Yeah.

238
00:12:15,523 --> 00:12:18,291
That doesn't appear to be
worth very much, right now.

239
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:22,860
I'm pregnant, Jake.

240
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:25,495
I just...

241
00:12:26,304 --> 00:12:28,403
I have a bad feeling
about all this.

242
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,137
- Robert, what...
- Don't make a scene.

243
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,521
What are you doing here?

244
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,739
You need to come with me.

245
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,598
Look, don't tell me
what to do.

246
00:12:52,242 --> 00:12:54,568
You are not allowed
within 500 feet of this family.

247
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,636
Circumstances have changed, Darcy.

248
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:56,983
Mom!

249
00:12:58,574 --> 00:12:59,022
Mom.

250
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,399
Oh, my God. The kids.

251
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:08,272
Unlock the door from the inside.

252
00:13:08,273 --> 00:13:09,997
Alison, it's, it's okay.
It's okay.

253
00:13:13,338 --> 00:13:14,814
You let them out of there right now,

254
00:13:14,815 --> 00:13:16,334
or so help me,
I'll start screaming.

255
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:17,881
No, you listen to me
very carefully.

256
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:19,676
In five seconds,
I'm getting on this truck

257
00:13:19,677 --> 00:13:21,258
and I am leaving
Washington for good.

258
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,924
And I did not come here
to discuss this with you.

259
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,504
Now you can
either trust me,

260
00:13:27,755 --> 00:13:30,591
and come with us
or you can stay here.

261
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:33,658
But you will never ever
see your children again.

262
00:13:58,314 --> 00:13:59,568
Hey, buddy, you in?

263
00:14:00,127 --> 00:14:00,860
I'm in.

264
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,359
Glad you changed your mind.

265
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:03,301
I'm telling you,

266
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:05,211
this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

267
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:07,960
Then how come this isn't the first time
I've heard you say that?

268
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,715
Do me a favor.

269
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:12,243
Skip ahead in your mind
a couple of months.

270
00:14:13,073 --> 00:14:14,790
Visualize yourself on a...

271
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:16,411
Mexican beach,

272
00:14:16,682 --> 00:14:18,958
knee deep in bikinis
and Benjamins.

273
00:14:19,132 --> 00:14:21,023
I try not to think
that far ahead.

274
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,936
Keeps me from being disappointed
when things go to hell.

275
00:14:24,032 --> 00:14:25,306
My pop once told me

276
00:14:25,383 --> 00:14:27,601
if you don't keep an eye
towards where you're going,

277
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:28,663
you'll never get there.

278
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:30,476
Speaking of eyes...

279
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:32,309
You should see the other guy.

280
00:14:32,444 --> 00:14:33,563
Fine, introduce us.

281
00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:37,421
Who's the job for, Freddy?

282
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:38,367
Don't matter who.

283
00:14:38,618 --> 00:14:40,354
They know you, and
your reputation.

284
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,747
I'm not going anywhere
until I know.

285
00:14:46,858 --> 00:14:48,286
It's an offshoot of Ravenwood.

286
00:14:49,173 --> 00:14:50,581
You'll meet 'em, tomorrow

287
00:14:50,582 --> 00:14:52,588
right before we get on a plane.
In the meantime,

288
00:14:52,723 --> 00:14:54,189
all you gotta worry about...

289
00:14:55,964 --> 00:14:56,833
is this.

290
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:01,328
There's three times that
waiting for you

291
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:02,235
when this is over.

292
00:15:02,341 --> 00:15:03,141
All we gotta do is

293
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:05,901
run a convoy through enemy territory
without getting killed.

294
00:15:05,984 --> 00:15:09,090
How many times I gotta get your back
before you start believing it, huh?

295
00:16:08,487 --> 00:16:09,355
Seat's all yours.

296
00:16:09,895 --> 00:16:10,532
Thank you.

297
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,531
Yeah, I hate, I hate sitting when
I got money on a game.

298
00:16:14,726 --> 00:16:17,118
<i>Swung on, it's a high
blast out toward left field.</i>

299
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:19,356
<i>It's way back, and it is gone!</i>

300
00:16:22,154 --> 00:16:24,285
Mary Bailey, you owe me five bucks.

301
00:16:24,286 --> 00:16:25,269
Pay up!

302
00:16:26,387 --> 00:16:28,297
Better yet, better yet.
Buy my, uh,

303
00:16:29,011 --> 00:16:31,229
good luck charm here,
a drink on me.

304
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,410
Don't waste your money,
I have an expense account.

305
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:34,838
What is your best wine?

306
00:16:35,725 --> 00:16:36,265
Beer.

307
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,102
Vodka, rocks.

308
00:16:40,627 --> 00:16:43,135
Did you know that it
is a three-hour cab ride

309
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,142
from the airport to
this godforsaken town?

310
00:16:45,143 --> 00:16:46,276
Scenic, though, ain't it?

311
00:16:46,908 --> 00:16:48,047
If you like corn.

312
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,783
Well, now,
who doesn't like corn?

313
00:16:50,825 --> 00:16:53,140
I mean, you got
corn on the cob,

314
00:16:53,506 --> 00:16:55,455
cornflakes, corn nuts,

315
00:16:55,532 --> 00:16:57,828
corn dogs, cornsicles.

316
00:16:58,118 --> 00:16:59,237
Cornsicles?

317
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:02,844
It's a joke, lady.

318
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,390
Can you not talk
to me, please?

319
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,953
Thank you.

320
00:17:11,082 --> 00:17:12,934
- Corn, corn chips?
- Seriously.

321
00:17:13,397 --> 00:17:14,420
Don't talk to me.

322
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:15,809
Bailey's.

323
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,870
<i>Hey, there.</i>

324
00:17:17,464 --> 00:17:18,052
Hi.

325
00:17:19,181 --> 00:17:20,473
Am I going to see you this week?

326
00:17:20,608 --> 00:17:22,094
<i>Well, you can see me right now.</i>

327
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:23,850
<i>Just turn around.</i>

328
00:17:27,728 --> 00:17:29,310
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

329
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:30,583
You have no idea

330
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:32,474
<i>how badly I want
to kiss you right now.</i>

331
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,018
Well.

332
00:17:34,365 --> 00:17:36,005
<i>Why don't you step
into my office?</i>

333
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,303
What in the...

334
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:47,406
heck do we have here?

335
00:17:48,072 --> 00:17:50,117
It's time for some changes, Johnston.

336
00:17:50,252 --> 00:17:51,602
Starting with your diet.

337
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,207
A man can't live on that.

338
00:17:54,766 --> 00:17:56,657
Can if he wants to
stay married to me.

339
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:02,174
Your blood pressure was ten
points over your last checkup.

340
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:04,893
Well, that's just the stress.
It's always up at election time.

341
00:18:04,894 --> 00:18:06,360
Then drop out of the race.

342
00:18:06,726 --> 00:18:08,096
What has gotten into you?

343
00:18:08,347 --> 00:18:11,530
Something happened watching April
listen to your heartbeat.

344
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:13,514
I began to wonder.

345
00:18:13,838 --> 00:18:16,058
How many good years do
we have left together?

346
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:17,361
Did you hear something I didn't?

347
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,558
'Cause all she told me was
I might be getting a cold.

348
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,147
This isn't,

349
00:18:20,513 --> 00:18:22,983
this isn't just about health,
yours or mine.

350
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,992
When you first took office
you made two oaths.

351
00:18:26,108 --> 00:18:27,767
One to the people
of this town,

352
00:18:28,057 --> 00:18:29,350
and the other one to me.

353
00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:32,572
Do you rember
what you said?

354
00:18:33,188 --> 00:18:33,671
Yeah.

355
00:18:34,886 --> 00:18:37,394
That I would never let the job
come before you and the kids.

356
00:18:38,841 --> 00:18:40,751
I'm just asking
for equal time.

357
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:43,298
I hear you, honey.

358
00:18:53,118 --> 00:18:54,315
You all stay put.

359
00:18:55,164 --> 00:18:56,399
Mom, do something.

360
00:18:56,727 --> 00:18:58,618
Robert, let us go.

361
00:18:59,081 --> 00:19:00,065
Please, I'm begging you.

362
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,511
I'll be back
in five minutes.

363
00:19:01,512 --> 00:19:02,804
- And then what?
- And then...

364
00:19:02,843 --> 00:19:03,576
we leave town.

365
00:19:03,672 --> 00:19:05,968
Oh, you're crazy,
I'm not going anywhere with you.

366
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:08,563
Dad, stop. Dad!

367
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,125
Let go of her,
Robert!

368
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:11,553
Listen to me, okay.

369
00:19:12,224 --> 00:19:14,211
I would never do
anything to hurt you,

370
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,141
your mother, or your brother.

371
00:19:16,276 --> 00:19:17,105
You believe me?

372
00:19:18,128 --> 00:19:19,999
Do you believe me?

373
00:19:20,462 --> 00:19:22,121
I barely know you.

374
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,455
Listen, Robert,
you are scaring Samuel.

375
00:19:29,838 --> 00:19:31,863
Unscare him, Darcy.

376
00:19:43,631 --> 00:19:44,864
Do you have your cell phone?

377
00:19:44,865 --> 00:19:46,447
No, he took it when
he picked me up.

378
00:19:47,913 --> 00:19:48,897
Not mine.

379
00:19:49,032 --> 00:19:51,000
Really?
Where is it, honey?

380
00:19:51,096 --> 00:19:52,157
In my backpack.

381
00:19:57,694 --> 00:19:59,064
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

382
00:20:12,685 --> 00:20:13,900
The door was unlocked.

383
00:20:16,505 --> 00:20:18,299
I love what you've done
with the place.

384
00:20:19,013 --> 00:20:20,595
What do you want, Agent Hicks?

385
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:22,270
Guess whose name
just popped up

386
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:24,430
on an international
passenger manifest?

387
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:26,205
You got me on
a no-fly list now?

388
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:29,523
No, not yet, but...

389
00:20:29,986 --> 00:20:31,086
I thought maybe...

390
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:33,247
we could work out a deal.

391
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,753
You're about to get into bed
with some very bad people, Jake.

392
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,434
Lucky for you,
your timing is perfect.

393
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:46,347
We're looking to nail Ravenwood.

394
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:47,523
They did that?

395
00:20:47,755 --> 00:20:50,369
They've been running weapons
since the start of the war.

396
00:20:50,658 --> 00:20:53,398
They'll sell arms to anybody,
even our enemies.

397
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:56,307
We need someone working for us

398
00:20:56,615 --> 00:20:57,927
that they'll
consider credible.

399
00:20:58,602 --> 00:21:00,145
And why would I
say yes to you?

400
00:21:01,322 --> 00:21:02,113
Because...

401
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,647
...you know firsthand
what they're capable of.

402
00:21:08,905 --> 00:21:10,564
Sarah, come on, we don't have...

403
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,353
Sarah?

404
00:22:05,781 --> 00:22:06,823
Hold it right there.

405
00:22:07,344 --> 00:22:08,521
Drop the case.

406
00:22:10,277 --> 00:22:12,245
Walk towards me slowly.

407
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,599
Put your hands in the air... now!

408
00:22:17,511 --> 00:22:18,341
This your truck?

409
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:21,061
It's a rental.

410
00:22:21,138 --> 00:22:22,180
Moving day, you know?

411
00:22:22,682 --> 00:22:23,936
What seems to
be the problem?

412
00:22:24,129 --> 00:22:25,017
Open the back.

413
00:22:25,615 --> 00:22:26,290
Okay.

414
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,103
What the hell?

415
00:22:36,264 --> 00:22:36,978
Cuff him.

416
00:22:38,097 --> 00:22:39,274
Hands behind your back.

417
00:22:41,685 --> 00:22:43,498
Help! Help!
Unlock the door.

418
00:22:43,576 --> 00:22:44,539
- Please.
- It's okay.

419
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,853
We're gonna get you out of here.

420
00:22:45,854 --> 00:22:47,473
- Can you open this door?
- We can't.

421
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,493
Can you unlock the door.

422
00:22:48,494 --> 00:22:49,091
Watch out!

423
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:56,827
Hey, Dad.

424
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:57,888
- Hey, Eric.
- Mary.

425
00:22:58,255 --> 00:23:00,531
Oh, darlin', would you get him
a beer, too?

426
00:23:00,975 --> 00:23:01,747
Sure thing.

427
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:02,781
Thanks.

428
00:23:09,552 --> 00:23:10,304
So, um...

429
00:23:11,693 --> 00:23:12,851
Why did I ask you here?

430
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,182
Yeah. Is everything okay?

431
00:23:14,452 --> 00:23:15,822
Uh, your mother and I have been...

432
00:23:15,823 --> 00:23:18,176
talking about the next
chapter in our lives.

433
00:23:18,177 --> 00:23:19,583
Be more accurate, she's...

434
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,920
pointing out how I seem to be
unwilling to turn the page.

435
00:23:23,363 --> 00:23:24,694
Sounds like Mom.

436
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,271
When I first took office,
you were in... what? Third grade?

437
00:23:30,656 --> 00:23:31,177
Second.

438
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,778
My team won the pee-wee
football trophy that year.

439
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:37,328
I scored two touchdowns
in the championship game.

440
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:39,720
Hard to remember
back that far.

441
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,916
Maybe because
you didn't make the game, Dad.

442
00:23:42,804 --> 00:23:43,344
Right.

443
00:23:46,006 --> 00:23:46,836
Well,

444
00:23:47,086 --> 00:23:49,016
your mother is afraid that if I keep

445
00:23:49,017 --> 00:23:50,906
going the way I'm going,
we're gonna wind up

446
00:23:50,907 --> 00:23:52,450
missing more than
pee-wee football.

447
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,026
And I've been
thinking about it,

448
00:23:56,078 --> 00:23:57,630
and I want to ask
you a question.

449
00:24:01,152 --> 00:24:03,563
If I decided to drop
out of the race,

450
00:24:03,564 --> 00:24:05,415
would you consider
running in my place?

451
00:24:07,132 --> 00:24:07,711
What?

452
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:12,045
You'd make a good candidate, son.

453
00:24:12,469 --> 00:24:14,668
You've been here
your whole life, you live clean,

454
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:16,135
unlike your brother Jake.

455
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,218
Plus, selfishly, I'd get to...

456
00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:21,710
step down and still have some influence
over how things were run.

457
00:24:21,932 --> 00:24:23,205
Oh, y-you're serious?

458
00:24:23,398 --> 00:24:24,112
Well, you...

459
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:26,350
You're smart, you're decisive.

460
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,298
Even got yourself a law degree.

461
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:29,919
Which I plan on using some day.

462
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,967
Plan on doing a lot
of things some day.

463
00:24:33,488 --> 00:24:35,186
Nothing you've
been sharing with me.

464
00:24:37,748 --> 00:24:39,484
Let me know if you
need anything else.

465
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:42,784
So, you take the night
and think about it.

466
00:24:42,842 --> 00:24:43,961
Talk to April about it.

467
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:45,774
It's gonna effect her, too.

468
00:24:46,913 --> 00:24:47,472
Yeah.

469
00:24:55,068 --> 00:24:55,454
Hey.

470
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:57,399
- What's up?
- We need to talk.

471
00:25:00,235 --> 00:25:00,872
What's up?

472
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:03,071
Cargo, we're transporting
for Ravenwood,

473
00:25:03,072 --> 00:25:04,267
you have any idea what it is?

474
00:25:04,268 --> 00:25:05,975
I don't ask those kind
of questions, man.

475
00:25:05,976 --> 00:25:07,124
Stinger Missiles. RPGs.

476
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:09,711
It's not like this was ever some
kind of humanitarian mission.

477
00:25:09,712 --> 00:25:11,855
They've been selling them
to the insurgents, Freddie

478
00:25:11,856 --> 00:25:13,770
They'll be used to kill our own guys!

479
00:25:14,116 --> 00:25:15,783
The Feds are on
to the whole thing.

480
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,826
They want us to help
take down Ravenwood.

481
00:25:17,827 --> 00:25:19,387
Whoa. Are you crazy?

482
00:25:19,388 --> 00:25:21,251
We don't have a choice.
They're watching us.

483
00:25:21,252 --> 00:25:22,152
So is Ravenwood, man.

484
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,155
I'm more worried about them
than the government.

485
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:25,456
If we don't work with the Feds,

486
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,365
they'll make sure
Ravenwood believes you are.

487
00:25:35,604 --> 00:25:37,208
- You got your money with you?
- What?

488
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:38,953
- Your money.
- Yeah, I can get it.

489
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,273
Get Anna, grab whatever you can,
we'll meet in an hour.

490
00:25:41,274 --> 00:25:42,908
- Then what?
- We'll take off tonight.

491
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:45,281
If they come after us, at least
we'll have a head start.

492
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:46,376
All right?

493
00:25:50,746 --> 00:25:52,752
Nobody from school
better see us.

494
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:55,955
Gonna make it pretty hard for me
to get on that plane tonight

495
00:25:55,956 --> 00:25:56,997
and call in sick tomorrow.

496
00:25:56,998 --> 00:25:59,320
You know, if this was Chicago,
you could walk for miles

497
00:25:59,321 --> 00:26:01,077
without ever running
into anyone you know.

498
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:02,380
Really? Chicago again?

499
00:26:02,381 --> 00:26:05,582
Plus, there's the pizza,
the Cubs, the culture...

500
00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:07,584
What are you getting at, huh?

501
00:26:07,742 --> 00:26:08,900
Okay, I have a confession.

502
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,641
The meeting tomorrow
isn't just a meeting.

503
00:26:10,642 --> 00:26:13,035
It's an interview for a startup
venture capital firm.

504
00:26:13,285 --> 00:26:14,713
Final interview,
actually.

505
00:26:16,796 --> 00:26:17,915
Are you serious?

506
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:20,481
Well, I thought maybe you could
get to know the city a little.

507
00:26:20,482 --> 00:26:21,793
You might fall in love with it.

508
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,645
You're a jerk.

509
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:26,597
Emily, we have to at
least talk about it.

510
00:26:26,598 --> 00:26:27,755
We have talked about this.

511
00:26:27,965 --> 00:26:30,470
This is not the kind of opportunity
you can just say no to.

512
00:26:30,471 --> 00:26:30,771
Really?

513
00:26:31,578 --> 00:26:32,014
No.

514
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,406
There. How hard is that?

515
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,407
I cannot believe you.

516
00:26:35,525 --> 00:26:37,416
We're supposed to be married
in a few months.

517
00:26:37,417 --> 00:26:38,844
Why do you think I'm doing this?

518
00:26:38,845 --> 00:26:39,876
Because you're selfish,

519
00:26:39,981 --> 00:26:41,255
and you don't listen.

520
00:26:41,621 --> 00:26:44,071
I told you when you proposed to me
I didn't want to move.

521
00:26:44,418 --> 00:26:46,097
Now you go behind my back like this?

522
00:26:46,222 --> 00:26:47,813
Yeah, well, screw me for thinking

523
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,588
you might be open
to changing your mind.

524
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:52,347
I mean, what is it about
this town that's got you so...

525
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:54,295
addicted to it?

526
00:26:55,202 --> 00:26:56,668
This town is my history.

527
00:26:57,632 --> 00:26:59,639
It is everything
that I know and love.

528
00:27:00,112 --> 00:27:01,634
It's where I want
my kids to grow up.

529
00:27:01,635 --> 00:27:03,438
If you don't understand that,
then maybe...

530
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:04,077
Maybe what?

531
00:27:07,242 --> 00:27:09,229
I'm not getting on that plane
with you tonight.

532
00:27:10,753 --> 00:27:13,840
If you decide to take that job tomorrow,
then don't bother coming back.

533
00:27:31,261 --> 00:27:32,515
I'm tired.

534
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:40,194
Allison,

535
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,719
there are two bedrooms
upstairs.

536
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,689
Take your brother up to the one
on the right. That's where you'll sleep.

537
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,841
Who's stuff is all this?
Who lives here?

538
00:27:48,172 --> 00:27:48,866
We do.

539
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:53,265
Go on upstairs.
I'll be there in a minute.

540
00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:55,522
Come on, Sammy.
I'll read to you.

541
00:27:58,183 --> 00:27:59,785
I don't know what's going on, Robert,

542
00:28:00,325 --> 00:28:01,328
and right now, I'm...

543
00:28:02,062 --> 00:28:03,837
I'm too exhausted to fight,

544
00:28:04,261 --> 00:28:06,171
but I promise you one thing.

545
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,917
Come tomorrow,
one way or another,

546
00:28:07,918 --> 00:28:09,094
I will have you arrested.

547
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:10,907
But you know, come tomorrow,

548
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:13,608
a whole lot of things
will be different.

549
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,798
Freddie, come here.

550
00:28:33,441 --> 00:28:35,274
- All right. What happened?!
- Ravenwood.

551
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:37,705
Those sons a bitches shot me!

552
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:38,553
Oh, God!

553
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,165
Take it easy,
take it easy.

554
00:28:45,518 --> 00:28:46,472
Find Anna.

555
00:28:46,682 --> 00:28:47,752
Make sure she's all right.

556
00:28:47,753 --> 00:28:49,523
First, we got to get
you to the hospital.

557
00:28:49,908 --> 00:28:51,962
All I care about
is Anna and my kid.

558
00:28:52,285 --> 00:28:53,409
Get them on that bus.

559
00:28:53,913 --> 00:28:55,576
Then you get the hell
out of here, too!

560
00:28:55,577 --> 00:28:56,866
They're gonna come after you.

561
00:28:57,678 --> 00:28:58,885
Oh, they're coming after you.

562
00:28:58,886 --> 00:28:59,726
Try to stay with me.

563
00:28:59,727 --> 00:29:00,852
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

564
00:29:00,853 --> 00:29:02,111
I need an ambulance right away.

565
00:29:02,182 --> 00:29:04,186
My friend's been shot,
he's lost a lot of blood.

566
00:29:04,187 --> 00:29:04,919
<i>Is he breathing?</i>

567
00:29:05,293 --> 00:29:06,239
Stay with me, Freddie!

568
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,376
<i>Sir, is he breathing?</i>

569
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:09,004
Stay with me, man.

570
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:10,952
Come on, man, stay with me.

571
00:29:11,671 --> 00:29:12,490
You're all right.

572
00:29:12,627 --> 00:29:14,968
You're all right.
Stay with me.

573
00:29:21,496 --> 00:29:22,934
I can't believe he's gone.

574
00:29:32,219 --> 00:29:33,278
I'm really sorry.

575
00:29:33,712 --> 00:29:35,071
It's not your fault. You did...

576
00:29:35,743 --> 00:29:37,339
You did everything that you could.

577
00:29:44,736 --> 00:29:45,453
I don't want it.

578
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:46,380
I don't want it.

579
00:29:46,956 --> 00:29:48,070
It belonged to Freddie.

580
00:29:48,347 --> 00:29:49,334
Use it for the baby.

581
00:29:49,697 --> 00:29:51,349
My family will help me.
You keep it.

582
00:29:52,003 --> 00:29:52,375
No.

583
00:29:53,932 --> 00:29:54,841
I promised him.

584
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:57,378
Just put it away.

585
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:03,326
<i>Platform for Houston.
Platform six.</i>

586
00:30:03,531 --> 00:30:04,463
You better go.

587
00:30:14,152 --> 00:30:14,974
Come with me.

588
00:30:16,325 --> 00:30:17,835
Come on,
you can start over, too.

589
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,858
No, I can't. Not yet.

590
00:30:20,263 --> 00:30:21,748
Then where will you go?

591
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,524
You were up early.

592
00:30:29,852 --> 00:30:31,376
Oh, I've been coughing all night.

593
00:30:31,377 --> 00:30:32,785
I didn't want to wake you.

594
00:30:35,563 --> 00:30:36,431
Paris.

595
00:30:38,997 --> 00:30:40,212
I hate France.

596
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,222
I'm sure they'd be
devastated to hear it.

597
00:30:47,042 --> 00:30:49,647
Studied French and Italian
for four years.

598
00:30:50,303 --> 00:30:52,695
After all those years,
all I can remember is my name,

599
00:30:52,696 --> 00:30:53,891
how to count to ten and,

600
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:56,457
"Would you please pass
that packet of sugar?"

601
00:31:00,816 --> 00:31:02,109
Book the trip.

602
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:06,835
I don't think they take reservations
six years in advance.

603
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,558
I was thinking
more like Christmas.

604
00:31:11,484 --> 00:31:13,221
What the hell.
Book one for Italy, too.

605
00:31:13,684 --> 00:31:14,185
<i>Hello.</i>

606
00:31:15,343 --> 00:31:15,980
<i>Hello?</i>

607
00:31:17,562 --> 00:31:18,738
<i>Is anybody there?</i>

608
00:31:19,626 --> 00:31:20,050
<i>Hello?</i>

609
00:31:20,301 --> 00:31:21,053
Jake.

610
00:31:23,986 --> 00:31:25,664
<i>One new message.</i>

611
00:31:26,204 --> 00:31:27,670
Hey, Emily, it's Roger.

612
00:31:28,634 --> 00:31:30,737
Just tried your cell,
but I couldn't reach you.

613
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:34,364
Hopefully, you haven't run off
with the milkman yet.

614
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:39,264
Last night was terrible.

615
00:31:40,016 --> 00:31:41,039
I kept wanting to...

616
00:31:41,271 --> 00:31:44,474
get up and tell the captain
I'd made a horrible mistake,

617
00:31:44,475 --> 00:31:45,824
and to turn the plane around.

618
00:31:47,078 --> 00:31:48,737
My home is where you are, babe.

619
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:52,364
And if that means Jericho, Kansas
for the rest of my life,

620
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:53,926
it'll be a happy one.

621
00:31:56,666 --> 00:31:57,804
I'm flying back tonight.

622
00:31:57,823 --> 00:31:59,386
I get into Wichita at 10:30.

623
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:02,299
I can't think of anything
I'd rather see

624
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,151
than your beautiful face
when I get home.

625
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:07,643
And in case you're wondering, I...

626
00:32:07,971 --> 00:32:09,331
I didn't go on that interview.

627
00:32:39,109 --> 00:32:40,653
Oh, excuse me.

628
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:42,562
Excuse me.

629
00:32:42,698 --> 00:32:44,048
Oh, it's you.

630
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,591
Yeah, sorry, not ringing a bell.

631
00:32:45,592 --> 00:32:48,678
Look, I have been standing out
here forever waiting for a cab.

632
00:32:48,795 --> 00:32:51,727
Yeah, I suggest you nicely
ask someone for a ride.

633
00:32:52,114 --> 00:32:54,217
Do you know where
the Richmond Farm is?

634
00:32:55,972 --> 00:32:58,037
Well, yeah, I ought to.
I'm Stanley Richmond.

635
00:33:01,008 --> 00:33:02,705
- You got to be kidding.
- No.

636
00:33:06,082 --> 00:33:08,551
You see, now is the part
where you tell me your name.

637
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:10,153
Mimi Clark.

638
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:12,179
Really? Well, it's...

639
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:14,841
nice to meet you, Ms. Clark.

640
00:33:14,977 --> 00:33:16,598
Do you not read your mail?

641
00:33:17,293 --> 00:33:19,763
Nope. Nothing but bills
and bad news. Why?

642
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:22,348
Well, this would be a little of both.

643
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,335
I work for the IRS.

644
00:33:25,338 --> 00:33:26,554
And according to our records,

645
00:33:26,555 --> 00:33:29,390
you owe more than $180,000
in back taxes.

646
00:33:31,106 --> 00:33:32,707
It's nice to meet you.

647
00:33:42,836 --> 00:33:46,289
<i>Mr. Speaker,
the President of the United States.</i>

648
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:55,664
<i>We all know that
these divisions pale in comparison</i>

649
00:33:55,665 --> 00:33:58,886
<i>to the fundamental dangers posed
by the thrt of terrorism.</i>

650
00:34:46,425 --> 00:34:48,720
<i>We have an eternal commitment
to leave the world</i>

651
00:34:48,721 --> 00:34:51,093
<i>a better place for our children
and grandchildren.</i>

652
00:34:51,094 --> 00:34:53,119
<i>This has always been our promise.</i>

653
00:34:56,206 --> 00:34:57,267
Not another step.

654
00:34:58,347 --> 00:34:59,312
Where are my kids?

655
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,508
Give me the keys.

656
00:35:00,509 --> 00:35:02,341
Darcy, put that gun down,

657
00:35:02,342 --> 00:35:04,077
'cause you don't even
know how to use it.

658
00:35:04,078 --> 00:35:06,813
I don't want to shoot you, Robert,
but so help me, I'm prepared to!

659
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:07,786
Now, give me the keys!

660
00:35:07,787 --> 00:35:09,137
<i>Mom! Mom, come quick!</i>

661
00:35:09,138 --> 00:35:10,082
Baby, stay outside!

662
00:35:11,295 --> 00:35:13,128
<i>Mom! Mom!
Something's happening!</i>

663
00:35:22,214 --> 00:35:23,969
<i>Woody, what are you looking at?</i>

664
00:36:53,622 --> 00:36:54,297
Jake!

665
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:55,763
Jake, we got
to go outside!

666
00:36:56,149 --> 00:36:56,786
Now!

667
00:37:03,379 --> 00:37:04,768
<i>Help them.
Help them.</i>

668
00:37:05,366 --> 00:37:06,331
Bring them inside.

669
00:37:08,356 --> 00:37:09,571
Some of them were on planes.

670
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:12,561
Landed in the middle of nowhere.

671
00:37:13,043 --> 00:37:14,509
Been walking for weeks.

672
00:37:15,725 --> 00:37:17,422
They must have gone through hell.

673
00:37:20,585 --> 00:37:22,341
<i>Can you give me
a hand with this?</i>

674
00:37:27,141 --> 00:37:28,241
Oh, my God.

675
00:37:31,154 --> 00:37:31,675
Roger.

676
00:37:41,186 --> 00:37:42,382
Is it really you?

677
00:37:47,573 --> 00:37:48,904
I thought you were dead.

678
00:37:54,209 --> 00:37:55,656
Come on. Come with me.

679
00:38:03,854 --> 00:38:06,459
We only have another half hour
before the generators shut down.

680
00:38:06,961 --> 00:38:08,660
Well, I'm sure they'll
make an exception.

681
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,933
Do we have any extra blankets?

682
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:12,459
I already brought everything
down I could find. Listen, Eric,

683
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,022
these people need medical attention.

684
00:38:15,102 --> 00:38:16,376
You have to find a doctor.

685
00:38:20,282 --> 00:38:20,919
I'm okay.

686
00:38:26,861 --> 00:38:29,735
Are there any more people out there?
We could send a search party.

687
00:38:29,736 --> 00:38:30,739
21 men

688
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,935
and 32 women.

689
00:38:33,671 --> 00:38:34,847
I'll do a head count.

690
00:38:42,475 --> 00:38:43,980
What happened to you out there?

691
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:48,803
We waited in that field
for two days

692
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:50,153
after our plane went down.

693
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:53,355
No one came.

694
00:38:54,648 --> 00:38:55,555
Eventually, I...

695
00:38:56,114 --> 00:38:56,982
went for help.

696
00:38:57,561 --> 00:38:58,391
I walked for...

697
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:00,996
I don't how long.

698
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:03,465
Wound up in this...

699
00:39:04,044 --> 00:39:05,028
refugee camp.

700
00:39:05,665 --> 00:39:06,282
Nebraska.

701
00:39:10,238 --> 00:39:11,627
Most of us are from there.

702
00:39:13,653 --> 00:39:15,611
I can't imagine
what you've seen out there.

703
00:39:20,463 --> 00:39:21,003
Roger?

704
00:39:24,901 --> 00:39:26,791
I said, I can't imagine
what you've seen.

705
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,842
Couldn't have
imagined it either.

706
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,533
Hey, wash up.

707
00:39:36,534 --> 00:39:37,710
Dinner's almost ready.

708
00:39:38,713 --> 00:39:39,234
Robert?

709
00:39:40,489 --> 00:39:41,038
Darcy,

710
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:43,228
I need you to keep the kids
in the house for a while

711
00:39:43,229 --> 00:39:44,810
until I can sort something out.

712
00:39:45,447 --> 00:39:46,412
What does that mean?

713
00:39:46,413 --> 00:39:48,900
It means you stay inside,

714
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:51,293
and you don't answer the door.

715
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:54,593
Here.

716
00:39:58,665 --> 00:39:59,668
We're playing football.

717
00:40:00,517 --> 00:40:02,041
Man, Sam,
that is really cool.

718
00:40:02,407 --> 00:40:04,124
Daddy's gonna put that
on the fridge.

719
00:40:05,397 --> 00:40:07,152
Sam, I want you to go upstairs,

720
00:40:07,153 --> 00:40:08,561
tell your sister dinner's ready.

721
00:40:08,562 --> 00:40:09,622
Okay? Right now.

722
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:14,617
<i>Allison!</i>

723
00:40:17,106 --> 00:40:18,785
Are we in danger, Robert?

724
00:40:20,656 --> 00:40:22,586
I've asked you that question
a thousand times,

725
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:23,627
you've always said no.

726
00:40:25,267 --> 00:40:26,001
I don't...

727
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:28,219
mean to scare you, D.

728
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:37,249
All right, we'll do
whatever you say.

729
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:40,837
I trust you.

730
00:40:49,653 --> 00:40:51,853
My God. Where did
they all come from?

731
00:40:52,528 --> 00:40:54,939
I'm gonna need warm water,
as much as you can make.

732
00:40:55,514 --> 00:40:57,039
I've made a list of the injured.

733
00:41:09,174 --> 00:41:10,081
How's he doing?

734
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,088
I think he might be in shock.

735
00:41:16,196 --> 00:41:17,450
He doesn't want to be treated

736
00:41:17,451 --> 00:41:19,148
until everybody else
has been seen.

737
00:41:21,038 --> 00:41:22,813
- Jake, I, um...
- Go.

738
00:41:24,762 --> 00:41:26,035
He's gonna need you.

739
00:41:38,422 --> 00:41:40,641
<i>You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.</i>

740
00:41:40,642 --> 00:41:42,397
<i>You need to keep them
clean and warm.</i>

741
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,402
Do you have a place to stay?

742
00:41:45,618 --> 00:41:47,297
Do you know anyone
in Jericho?

743
00:41:50,094 --> 00:41:51,020
Actually...

744
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:52,583
I do.
