Hello, Rob.

3
00:00:04,255 --> 00:00:06,255
Someone on my team
sold us all out.

4
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:09,477
You’re smart enough to know that they
would say anything to get you to talk.

5
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:13,013
Get the package.

6
00:00:23,103 --> 00:00:25,032
In the last three months,
I remembered

7
00:00:25,053 --> 00:00:26,243
all the reasons...

8
00:00:26,738 --> 00:00:28,288
why I needed you in my life.

9
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:29,439
So have I.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,881
I've also remembered
why it can never work.

11
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:34,381
I told Darcy she and the kids
can come stay with us.

12
00:00:34,397 --> 00:00:36,295
Thanks, Jimmy.
I appreciate that.

13
00:00:38,192 --> 00:00:39,561
<i>We have also received reports

14
00:00:39,562 --> 00:00:42,427
<i>that the bombers gained
the trust of local officials

15
00:00:42,428 --> 00:00:45,597
<i>which allowed the terrorists
access to secure locations.

16
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,910
I’ve heard that voice before.

17
00:00:47,994 --> 00:00:50,524
- That's the guy that does the
farm report.  - It’s real news.

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,258
<i>In New York, the terrorists
who were apprehended,

19
00:00:53,468 --> 00:00:56,252
<i>were all carrying nearly perfect
fake FBI badges.

20
00:01:18,615 --> 00:01:21,940
<i>- You're drunk.
- Yes, I am, Darcy.

21
00:01:22,245 --> 00:01:23,495
<i>Yes, I am.

22
00:01:24,112 --> 00:01:25,112
<i>What ?

23
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,703
What is it, Rob ?

24
00:03:08,544 --> 00:03:10,660
Is all that really
worth it for 6 kids ?

25
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:13,869
Six kids in a conference room
is not Harvard, but it's a start.

26
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,494
I meant for you.

27
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:18,869
I think it's time we start trying
to get things back to normal.

28
00:03:18,997 --> 00:03:20,764
To be honest with you,
if I'm a kid...

29
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:24,214
going to school isn't exactly high
on my list of priorities these days.

30
00:03:24,822 --> 00:03:26,172
Hey, Jimmy.

31
00:03:27,347 --> 00:03:29,827
Hey, can I... borrow you for a few
minutes, I need your help.

32
00:03:29,894 --> 00:03:31,977
I'm going to get you
a bat signal or something.

33
00:03:34,344 --> 00:03:35,344
What's wrong ?

34
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:39,093
You remember, last week on the
radio broadcast, they said that

35
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,026
terrorists used fake FBI badges
to move through security ?

36
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,676
I've seen one of those badges.

37
00:03:45,795 --> 00:03:46,861
Where ?

38
00:03:49,161 --> 00:03:51,990
I never went to Law school,
but I'm going to go ahead and guess.

39
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:54,522
- This is breaking and entering.
- It's called probable cause.

40
00:03:54,523 --> 00:03:56,556
It's called paranoïd
abuse of authority.

41
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,457
Come on, let's go... before he
comes home and catches you...

42
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:01,040
prying up his floorboards.

43
00:04:01,373 --> 00:04:03,040
The terrorists had FBI badges...

44
00:04:03,306 --> 00:04:05,322
Robert Hawkins has an FBI badge.

45
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,139
You think that's just coïncidence ?

46
00:04:07,222 --> 00:04:08,639
Maybe he's FBI !

47
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,231
Please, tell me you thought of that.

48
00:04:10,272 --> 00:04:13,106
I did...
and I asked his family.

49
00:04:13,306 --> 00:04:15,106
And they all say he's FBI.

50
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:18,439
But... when they said it they all
had this look on their face like...

51
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,822
there was something that
they weren't saying.

52
00:04:22,092 --> 00:04:24,408
Sort of like the look I've got
on my face right now.

53
00:04:24,508 --> 00:04:27,158
Look, I had a hunch,
and I was right.

54
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,000
Now, he's out on patrol...

55
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,133
he's not going to be back
for a while, so...

56
00:04:31,641 --> 00:04:33,008
Come on !

57
00:04:43,107 --> 00:04:44,740
Did you bust this lock open ?

58
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,613
You know, this is kinda
weird, but...

59
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,063
if he's FBI, isn't this what
his basement would look like ?

60
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,814
That's... that's what I said...

61
00:05:06,714 --> 00:05:08,964
until I saw this.

62
00:05:14,753 --> 00:05:17,103
- Does Gray know about this ?
- No.

63
00:05:17,303 --> 00:05:20,244
I wanted to get a second opinion
before I told anyone.

64
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:22,937
What do you want to do ?

65
00:06:13,014 --> 00:06:14,264
Don't.

66
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,863

71
00:06:43,865 --> 00:06:45,181
Hand it over.

72
00:06:45,631 --> 00:06:47,481
Nice and slow.

73
00:06:51,587 --> 00:06:53,120
Slide it over.

74
00:06:57,309 --> 00:06:58,721
What the hell are
you doing here ?

75
00:06:58,738 --> 00:07:00,854
Did you wipe out 23
American cities ?

76
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,262
- Get out of my house.
- Answer the question !

77
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:06,179
- Why would you even think that ?
- You've got a working generator...

78
00:07:06,213 --> 00:07:07,629
and a food supply.

79
00:07:08,202 --> 00:07:09,885
So like you knew the
attacks were coming.

80
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:12,259
- I'm gonna give you 10 seconds...
- Back up !

81
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:13,632
Jimmy knows I'm here.

82
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:15,325
If I don't call him off
when he gets back...

83
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:17,755
you're gonna have a lot more
people than me to deal with.

84
00:07:18,122 --> 00:07:19,722
I'm an FBI agent, Jake.

85
00:07:20,088 --> 00:07:21,505
That's what I heard.

86
00:07:22,012 --> 00:07:24,228
Problem is the radio was reporting
the terrorists used

87
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:27,236
forged FBI badges to get
their bombs into position.

88
00:07:28,303 --> 00:07:29,636
What is that room ?

89
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:33,172
How were you involved
in all of this ?

90
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:35,722
I need to know.

91
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,239
5 months ago, this was
a map of our country.

92
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:44,522
Now, it's an antique.

93
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:47,997
It's a picture of the way
things used to be.

94
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:50,615
Right now...

95
00:07:53,176 --> 00:07:54,892
all we're sure of is this.

96
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,559
But this is where we
start to rebuild.

97
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:01,456
So how do we do it ?

98
00:08:01,822 --> 00:08:02,822
How ?

99
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:05,756
We look to our history.

100
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:08,606
We study the people
that came before us.

101
00:08:10,514 --> 00:08:12,822
- Are you going to take attendance ?
- No.

102
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:16,555
Where are you going ?

103
00:08:16,852 --> 00:08:18,168
My mom's at home right now...

104
00:08:18,202 --> 00:08:21,368
trying to grow beets out of our
bathtub so we can eat newt month.

105
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:24,319
This stuff...
isn't important.

106
00:08:37,203 --> 00:08:39,103
I guess school's out
early today.

107
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,919
You don't have to stay
if you don't want to.

108
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:48,351
I don't think I should be hanging
around at home right now.

109
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:50,405
So, I guess I'm stuck here.

110
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:54,047
<i>So it's come to this...

111
00:08:54,122 --> 00:08:57,839
I want you to know this has nothing
to do with you personnally, I'm...

112
00:08:58,072 --> 00:08:59,072
sure you're...

113
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:00,755
wonderfull.

114
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:06,928
But let's be honest here, you're
the one that lays the fewest eggs

115
00:09:06,989 --> 00:09:09,804
and I distinctly told all of you
that this was going to happen.

116
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:12,896
I believe I made myself perfectly
clear in that regard.

117
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
All right.

118
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:17,087
The thing is...

119
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,320
If you knew me at all,
you would...

120
00:09:20,803 --> 00:09:22,270
see how really funny this is,

121
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:24,120
because this is so not my thing.

122
00:09:24,153 --> 00:09:26,087
No... this is Stanley's thing.

123
00:09:27,003 --> 00:09:29,737
It's just... I'm awfully hungry.

124
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,520
And... I don't want to get into the
whole circle of life business, but...

125
00:09:33,687 --> 00:09:36,087
I just cannot eat anymore sprouts.

126
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:40,379
OK ? Enough stalling...
Here we go...

127
00:09:42,845 --> 00:09:44,245
Here's my concern...

128
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:46,795
I've heard stories about how you're
gonna react to this, and

129
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,220
if I see half of you running around,
well I just know I'm gonna freak out.

130
00:09:50,232 --> 00:09:53,641
So if you could do your best
to minimize that part of it...

131
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:55,782
I'd just really appreciate it.

132
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
Sprouts it is.

133
00:10:28,885 --> 00:10:31,085
You really out here
looking for deer?

134
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:33,167
Thought they were all gone.

135
00:10:33,168 --> 00:10:34,443
What do you want Harry ?

136
00:10:35,954 --> 00:10:38,005
Do you think you could come
into city hall today ?

137
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,420
Gray’s still out, and
it’d be nice to have...

138
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:41,271
somebody around who knows
what they're doing.

139
00:10:41,283 --> 00:10:44,783
Not my job anymore, and get lost,
I'm trying to shoot some deer.

140
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:46,746
Just be for a day or two.

141
00:10:50,496 --> 00:10:53,629
You're starting to look an
awful lot like a deer, Harry.

142
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,169
I've been in the FBI
for 15 years.

143
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:09,436
I worked law enforcement after college,
and then I joined the bureau.

144
00:11:09,444 --> 00:11:10,586
Where did you go to school ?

145
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:12,636
Georgetown, you wanna see my ring ?

146
00:11:13,986 --> 00:11:15,969
The FBI, what were
you working on ?

147
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,151
I was sent here to monitor
the phone calls

148
00:11:18,152 --> 00:11:21,267
made in the area to a...
suspected terrorist cell.

149
00:11:22,101 --> 00:11:23,967
- And what did you find out ?
- Nothing.

150
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,234
Trail went dead.

151
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:26,901
We about done here ?

152
00:11:28,156 --> 00:11:29,656
Not even close.

153
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,906
Tell me about her...
Sarah Mason.

154
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:35,189
She's gone.

155
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:45,877
You're pretty thorough.

156
00:11:47,094 --> 00:11:48,827
Also took care of the one
in the cabinet

157
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,700
and the one behind
the water heater.

158
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,933
There's only one loaded
gun in this house...

159
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:56,100
and it's mine.
Sit down.

160
00:12:01,369 --> 00:12:02,936
Arms behind you.

161
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:10,286
Tell me about Sarah.

162
00:12:11,068 --> 00:12:13,851
Jimmy said she was also
a cop in St Louis.

163
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:16,634
She's working with you ?

164
00:12:17,851 --> 00:12:19,151
Against you ?

165
00:12:20,134 --> 00:12:21,134
Who are these people ?

166
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:23,234
You are making a serious mistake.

167
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,561
- I am a Federal Officer.
- Really ?

168
00:12:27,444 --> 00:12:28,994
Really sure you're not.

169
00:12:30,211 --> 00:12:33,228
Robert Willer...
State Department.

170
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,736
How about Robert Snyder...
Colombus PD ?

171
00:12:37,286 --> 00:12:40,753
Commander Robert Richmond...
Naval Intelligence.

172
00:12:42,218 --> 00:12:45,168
None of those are real...
and neither is that badge.

173
00:12:45,651 --> 00:12:47,118
Who the hell are you ?

174
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:48,959
Who do you you work for ?

175
00:12:56,731 --> 00:12:59,114
You do not wanna know
what I know.

176
00:12:59,164 --> 00:13:01,181
- I think I can handle it.
- Really ?

177
00:13:01,355 --> 00:13:03,681
Cause I can barely handle it,
and I was trained for this.

178
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,722
You want to tell me...
or you tell the whole town.

179
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:12,767
All right.

180
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:16,517
But once you hear this...

181
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:20,931
You are a part of it, Jake,
and there is no going back.

182
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:22,498
Who do you work for ?

183
00:13:24,931 --> 00:13:25,931
CIA.

184
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:30,831
Sarah Mason and I were part of
an off-the-books team.

185
00:13:31,246 --> 00:13:33,796
We were tracking the bombs
used in the attack.

186
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,146
Where did they come from...
the bombs ?

187
00:13:36,462 --> 00:13:38,396
The US government
brought them in.

188
00:13:39,746 --> 00:13:42,012
See, after the Soviet Union fell...

189
00:13:42,163 --> 00:13:45,029
neglected military in the
satellite republics started

190
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,625
selling their nuclear stockpiles
on the black market.

191
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:50,363
So the CIA started
an operation...

192
00:13:50,492 --> 00:13:53,892
get that material by any
and all means necessary.

193
00:13:54,492 --> 00:13:56,742
But a few years ago, a shipment
disappeared on its way

194
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:59,783
to the DOE storage complex
in Oak Ridge.

195
00:14:00,116 --> 00:14:02,666
And that is where my
CIA team came in.

196
00:14:02,745 --> 00:14:03,745
Why you ?

197
00:14:04,028 --> 00:14:05,478
I'm the best at what I do.

198
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,128
And what is that ?

199
00:14:08,462 --> 00:14:10,012
Satellite installation.

200
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,857
I have a 2 o'clock appointment
with Mr. Higgins.

201
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,076
I've been inside all day.
How's the weather out there ?

202
00:14:41,243 --> 00:14:42,843
You know, it looks like rain.

203
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:51,523
Thank you.

204
00:15:03,094 --> 00:15:04,894
- Hello Victor.
- Hawkins.

205
00:15:06,094 --> 00:15:07,977
I believe you know
everyone here...

206
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:10,364
except this young lady.

207
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:14,281
- Robert Hawkins.
- Sarah Mason.

208
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,597
All right, let's get down to it.

209
00:15:16,997 --> 00:15:18,881
We have a lot of
ground to cover.

210
00:15:21,314 --> 00:15:22,814
As most of you know...

211
00:15:22,997 --> 00:15:25,947
a shipment of nukes from
project Red Bell is missing.

212
00:15:27,062 --> 00:15:28,187
What you don't know...

213
00:15:28,237 --> 00:15:30,720
is that we have quality intel
that those warheads...

214
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,212
have been converted
into 25 small...

215
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:35,212
high yield devices.

216
00:15:35,403 --> 00:15:38,386
These bombs have been
dissiminated to extremists cells

217
00:15:38,436 --> 00:15:40,670
active within the United States.

218
00:15:42,836 --> 00:15:44,436
So, is this Al Qaeda ?

219
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:46,459
I wish it were that simple.

220
00:15:47,026 --> 00:15:48,543
It's much larger than that.

221
00:15:49,543 --> 00:15:51,609
It's a cross section of
domestic militias...

222
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:54,109
anarchists,
and religious fanatics.

223
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:57,342
As you can see,
these are terrorists...

224
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,775
that would never collaborate,
ideologically or politically.

225
00:16:00,908 --> 00:16:02,974
The only thing that links
them, is the desire

226
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:04,992
to take down the
federal government.

227
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:08,175
Our job, is to get undercover
in these cells...

228
00:16:08,616 --> 00:16:10,233
and find these bombs.

229
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,383
So who do we think
is orchestrating this ?

230
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:14,519
The agency's been at this
from every angle...

231
00:16:14,752 --> 00:16:17,602
and all we know is that
he's got deep ressources,

232
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,060
an ability to coordinate
diverse groups,

233
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:23,460
and by all indications...
he's an American.

234
00:16:28,344 --> 00:16:30,394
We were broken up
into groups of two.

235
00:16:31,219 --> 00:16:34,136
Each unit was...
assigned a terrorist cell.

236
00:16:34,905 --> 00:16:37,655
One agent went undercover,
one acted as a handler.

237
00:16:39,622 --> 00:16:41,955
You can't expect me to believe
you were sent here...

238
00:16:41,979 --> 00:16:42,987
undercover.

239
00:16:42,988 --> 00:16:44,638
What's so special
about this place ?

240
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:46,759
You know, I would
show you, but...

241
00:16:48,076 --> 00:16:49,476
that's clever.

242
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:52,961
It's over there...
behind the map.

243
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,660
Where did you get this ?

244
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:17,105
Those are defense department projections
they've been doing since the 50s.

245
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:21,705
The fallout scenarios in the event of
a nuclear attack on 20 US cities.

246
00:17:22,055 --> 00:17:23,455
And you see Jericho ?

247
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:25,909
It's outside the fallout zones, Jake.

248
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,974
It's got a salt mine,
plenty of farm land,

249
00:17:27,975 --> 00:17:30,225
and access to an untainted
water table.

250
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,200
So you weren't here to
monitor phone calls ?

251
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,900
Jericho was a rally-point in case
we failed in our mission.

252
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,060
Failed ?

253
00:17:37,044 --> 00:17:38,327
Or succeeded ?

254
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,527
And Johnston, was...

255
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:47,762
He wanted to come,
I know he did.

256
00:17:48,362 --> 00:17:51,362
He's just having a hard time
dealing with things lately.

257
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:53,679
He always gets quiet...

258
00:17:54,112 --> 00:17:56,178
when he's going through
something, but...

259
00:17:56,228 --> 00:17:58,328
just wish I could think
of something

260
00:17:58,595 --> 00:18:00,378
to help him get through this.

261
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,180
We miss you, sweetheart.

262
00:18:18,526 --> 00:18:19,726
There's no more sprouts.

263
00:18:21,193 --> 00:18:22,460
You finished them ?

264
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,143
I was hungry.

265
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:28,973
What are you doing here, Sean.
It's like 9:30 in the morning...

266
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,990
Oh, my...

267
00:18:31,706 --> 00:18:32,856
You slept here ?

268
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,323
Well, actually... there was not a
lot of sleeping going on.

269
00:18:37,656 --> 00:18:38,873
Get out of the house !

270
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:47,799
What are you doing ?

271
00:18:47,866 --> 00:18:50,233
- You let him spend a night ?
- Yes.

272
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:53,599
Well that doesn't seem like something
Stanley would approve of, does it ?

273
00:18:53,689 --> 00:18:55,272
Stanley's not here.

274
00:18:58,489 --> 00:19:02,456
Just like that. You infiltrated a
terror cell planning a nuclear attack ?

275
00:19:03,547 --> 00:19:04,547
Yeah...

276
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,044
just like that.

277
00:19:07,864 --> 00:19:09,481
It took me 2 years.

278
00:19:10,397 --> 00:19:11,797
8 months of it in prison...

279
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:14,064
developing contacts,
getting into the network.

280
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:17,572
The only outside person I
communicated with was my handler.

281
00:19:17,681 --> 00:19:19,364
After prison,
I spent another year

282
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:21,772
trying to gain their trust
on the outside.

283
00:19:21,922 --> 00:19:24,289
And even then, I was only
scratching the surface.

284
00:19:24,322 --> 00:19:25,322
But you got in.

285
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:28,405
How ?

286
00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:31,789
They were looking for
high grade government IDs.

287
00:19:33,989 --> 00:19:35,422
You gave them their badges !

288
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:38,652
I had to proove that I was loyal
and valuable to the cell, Jake.

289
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,969
- I think I've heard enough.
- No !

290
00:19:41,069 --> 00:19:42,952
You barely scratched
the surface.

291
00:19:44,752 --> 00:19:46,418
You're the one who
wanted to hear this,

292
00:19:46,777 --> 00:19:48,769
so why don't you hear it all ?

293
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:05,380
The cell was looking for IDs.

294
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,674
And I needed to get higher up
in their organisation.

295
00:20:10,053 --> 00:20:12,378
So I let it be known
that I had a source.

296
00:20:12,694 --> 00:20:14,061
See, the badges...

297
00:20:14,077 --> 00:20:17,227
were going to be tagged so that
my team could track them.

298
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:21,435
They sent me to make the buy
with another cell member.

299
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:23,816
It was a kid named Daryl.

300
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,683
How do we know
these are real ?

301
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:27,499
They're real enough.

302
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:29,054
Where did you get them from ?

303
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,549
How and where I got these
badges... is my business.

304
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,916
What you do with them...
is yours.

305
00:20:49,721 --> 00:20:52,104
- Nice doing business with you.
- You too.

306
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:57,304
We should celebrate, man.
Go out, get some girls.

307
00:20:58,117 --> 00:21:01,341
Except you don't really seem
like the type. All serious.

308
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:02,691
Are you married ?

309
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:04,249
I was.

310
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:06,708
Really ?
What happened ?

311
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:09,699
What the hell is going on ?

312
00:21:16,164 --> 00:21:17,564
Hold it right there !

313
00:21:20,231 --> 00:21:21,397
I'm sorry man.

314
00:21:22,164 --> 00:21:23,714
You gotta be kidding me.

315
00:21:24,605 --> 00:21:26,272
FBI !
Hands in the air !

316
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:30,505
Back against the car.

317
00:21:38,174 --> 00:21:40,741
<i>It turns out Daryl was
an FBI informant.

318
00:21:41,307 --> 00:21:44,457
But my handler got me out,
and we kept my cover intact.

319
00:21:45,021 --> 00:21:48,505
So the FBI have an informant
in my target cell.

320
00:21:48,655 --> 00:21:50,821
And they can't tell us
anything about that ?

321
00:21:50,888 --> 00:21:53,355
You know, I'm damn lucky
that my cover wasn't blown.

322
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,905
- Your cover's intact, yes ?
- Yeah, we believe so.

323
00:21:55,944 --> 00:21:57,210
Then let's move on.

324
00:21:57,394 --> 00:22:00,444
Have you been able to make contact
with those coordinating the attack ?

325
00:22:00,494 --> 00:22:03,860
No... but at this stage, I recommend
that we take down the cells

326
00:22:03,861 --> 00:22:05,227
that we've already inflitrated.

327
00:22:05,277 --> 00:22:08,094
You know, at the very least that
would disrupt the overall plan...

328
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:11,703
maybe delay it for...
- How many of the bombs can you get ?

329
00:22:13,235 --> 00:22:16,035
A third, for sure...
half if we're lucky.

330
00:22:17,018 --> 00:22:18,251
Look... I know...

331
00:22:18,252 --> 00:22:21,468
it's not ideal, but at this stage,
it is the safest move.

332
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,127
That's still a dozen
bombs in play.

333
00:22:24,151 --> 00:22:26,667
- What are you doing ?
- I just think there's a way to...

334
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:29,001
speed this up and get
all the bombs at once.

335
00:22:29,002 --> 00:22:31,451
- Yeah, and we agreed that...
- Do you mind ?

336
00:22:34,337 --> 00:22:37,687
I think there may be a way
to get us further inside.

337
00:22:38,754 --> 00:22:42,220
My partner tells the cell leader
that Daryl is the FBI informant.

338
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:45,871
That gives him the credibility
that he needs to move up faster.

339
00:22:46,087 --> 00:22:48,020
Then let us handle the FBI...

340
00:22:48,254 --> 00:22:51,120
and do whatever is necessary
to save the operation.

341
00:22:52,524 --> 00:22:55,974
- It's all gonna take some time,
but we're close  - OK.

342
00:22:56,824 --> 00:22:59,758
We're counting on you,
and you know the risks.

343
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,773
You'd better be right about this.

344
00:23:14,063 --> 00:23:15,929
This is the right way to go.

345
00:23:22,346 --> 00:23:23,346
Trust me.

346
00:23:32,112 --> 00:23:33,545
What would you have done ?

347
00:23:34,095 --> 00:23:35,595
Stayed in,
or pulled the plug ?

348
00:23:35,611 --> 00:23:37,836
It seems like the wrong
question to me.

349
00:23:39,506 --> 00:23:42,056
I'd ask myself how much
I trusted my partner.

350
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:06,974
Well, if I can sneak up here without
you so much as turning around...

351
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:09,274
how are you gonna
hear any game ?

352
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:12,065
I heard you half a mile
back in those shoes.

353
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:16,136
You said you'd come with me
to see April today.

354
00:24:19,186 --> 00:24:20,186
Fine.

355
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:23,986
You coming home for dinner ?

356
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:32,093
There are no deer in these woods,
they've all been picked clean.

357
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,726
Then, I guess I'll
be here a while.

358
00:24:48,025 --> 00:24:49,592
I never wanted to be a mom'.

359
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:51,792
I didn't sign up for this.

360
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,484
You know what, you're right.
I owe it to Stanley.

361
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,634
So I'm just gonna have
to jump in...

362
00:24:57,734 --> 00:25:00,958
with both feet, whether she wants
to hear from me or not.

363
00:25:02,455 --> 00:25:04,471
Listen to me going on
about my own problems.

364
00:25:04,472 --> 00:25:07,822
You must be ady to take this hatchet
and do the damn job yourself.

365
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,279
I didn't know that he
knew how to sign.

366
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,103
What did he say to you ?

367
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,870
Never mind, look...

368
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:38,270
That boy's bad news.

369
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,470
Now, I can't stop you
from seeing him...

370
00:25:40,537 --> 00:25:44,203
but he is no longer welcome in this
house, do you understand me ?

371
00:25:58,404 --> 00:25:59,404
Allison...

372
00:25:59,687 --> 00:26:02,354
so why do you feel like you
can't hang out at home ?

373
00:26:04,267 --> 00:26:06,317
You don't have to talk to me
if you don't want to.

374
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:08,131
It's not that I don't wanna
talk about it.

375
00:26:08,281 --> 00:26:09,281
It's just...

376
00:26:09,931 --> 00:26:11,315
my family's pretty weird.

377
00:26:12,148 --> 00:26:13,948
My family was pretty weird too.

378
00:26:13,981 --> 00:26:16,948
In fact, when I was your age, I didn't
want to hang out with them either.

379
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,105
What about now ?

380
00:26:19,472 --> 00:26:20,555
They're gone.

381
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:26,198
There's this thing that went
down at my house...

382
00:26:26,249 --> 00:26:27,499
a couple weeks ago.

383
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:31,074
I did something.

384
00:26:31,962 --> 00:26:34,062
OK. What did you do ?

385
00:26:35,612 --> 00:26:38,478
I did something that...
can't be forgiven.

386
00:26:41,145 --> 00:26:42,744
Now my mom just keeps...

387
00:26:43,494 --> 00:26:44,494
looking at me.

388
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:50,909
Like I've changed into some kind
of monster, or something.

389
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:54,042
You know you haven't, right ?

390
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:00,443
So... even though you
weren't sure about the plan,

391
00:27:00,444 --> 00:27:02,569
you outed the informant
to the cell leader.

392
00:27:03,611 --> 00:27:05,711
Once we decided to leave
the bombs in play,

393
00:27:05,712 --> 00:27:08,277
it was the only way for me to
get deep enough into the cell

394
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:09,511
and gain their trust.

395
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:12,144
I told the cell leader that
Daryl was the informant,

396
00:27:12,244 --> 00:27:14,894
but I wanted to get him out of there
before they killed him.

397
00:27:14,994 --> 00:27:17,327
Come on, grab what you
need and let's go.

398
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,777
They're gonna hunt me down,
and they're gonna kill me.

399
00:27:20,951 --> 00:27:22,301
It's your lucky day, Daryl.

400
00:27:22,302 --> 00:27:24,835
They're gonna get you into witness
protection, so don't worry.

401
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,701
We're gonna get
you out of here.

402
00:27:28,984 --> 00:27:29,984
Stay there.

403
00:27:35,598 --> 00:27:37,398
- Damn it !
- What is it ?

404
00:27:37,814 --> 00:27:39,548
<i>Daryl, we just wanna talk.

405
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:40,998
The cell leader.

406
00:28:10,553 --> 00:28:12,237
You gotta get me
out of this place.

407
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,270
Run !

408
00:28:13,462 --> 00:28:14,837
I'll tell them that
you got away.

409
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:17,803
I think my leg is broken.
Please, help me !

410
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:21,303
Or I'm gonna tell them
who you really are.

411
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:25,003
I'm sorry.

412
00:29:00,067 --> 00:29:02,134
<i>So, I finally gain their trust.

413
00:29:02,954 --> 00:29:04,054
<i>I was in.

414
00:29:06,727 --> 00:29:07,744
You killed him.

415
00:29:13,865 --> 00:29:15,365
It was either killed him...

416
00:29:15,848 --> 00:29:18,015
or possibly let millions
of people die.

417
00:29:18,182 --> 00:29:19,315
They died anyway.

418
00:29:41,129 --> 00:29:42,129
<i>Jake ?

419
00:29:42,496 --> 00:29:43,896
<i>You're still down there ?

420
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:45,229
Call him off.

421
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:48,379
You're not helping your cause by
keeping that gun in my face.

422
00:29:48,463 --> 00:29:49,546
<i>Hey, Jake ?

423
00:29:49,729 --> 00:29:51,663
Do not make me kill him Jake.

424
00:29:53,963 --> 00:29:54,979
All right.

425
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,329
- All right !
<i>- Jake ?

426
00:30:06,069 --> 00:30:07,219
What's going on, Jake ?

427
00:30:07,336 --> 00:30:09,102
We need a little more
time, that's all.

428
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,686
- You're sure ?
- Yeah, we're all right.

429
00:30:13,448 --> 00:30:15,698
- I... I'm out front.
- OK.

430
00:30:29,766 --> 00:30:30,966
Turn around, Jake.

431
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,445
It is not about this anymore.

432
00:30:50,061 --> 00:30:51,061
We're past this.

433
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,502
Starting now,
we trust each other.

434
00:30:57,052 --> 00:30:58,952
You need to tell me everything.

435
00:30:59,102 --> 00:31:00,110
Done telling.

436
00:31:00,569 --> 00:31:01,893
Now, I gotta show you.

437
00:31:13,193 --> 00:31:14,443
What are you doing here ?

438
00:31:14,576 --> 00:31:16,509
It's your first day
at a new school.

439
00:31:18,546 --> 00:31:21,479
You know, the last time you had one
of those, Sam was in diapers.

440
00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:26,613
Doesn'’t look like you
had a big turnout.

441
00:31:27,153 --> 00:31:29,603
No, most people left early.

442
00:31:29,769 --> 00:31:31,853
I guess you knew better.

443
00:31:34,233 --> 00:31:37,399
I figured you didn't really want
me around the house anyway.

444
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:41,633
Why would you say that ?

445
00:31:44,701 --> 00:31:45,701
You know...

446
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:47,434
because of what I did.

447
00:31:50,934 --> 00:31:52,267
Allison, I love you.

448
00:31:53,101 --> 00:31:54,834
OK ? Nothing will
change that.

449
00:31:56,856 --> 00:31:57,856
Hear me baby ?

450
00:31:59,023 --> 00:32:00,690
Nothing will change that.

451
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:03,690
My little girl.

452
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:10,535
Mom, please
don't be mad at me.

453
00:32:11,652 --> 00:32:13,202
I'm so sorry, mom'.

454
00:32:27,997 --> 00:32:30,064
- Here's the part I don't get.
- What ?

455
00:32:30,097 --> 00:32:32,097
If you're telling the truth...

456
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,380
you made it.

457
00:32:34,964 --> 00:32:38,180
You made it deep inside the cell,
you gained their trust.

458
00:32:38,796 --> 00:32:39,796
Right.

459
00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:41,879
Then, what happened ?

460
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,046
Somebody tipped off the
terrorists, Jake.

461
00:32:48,351 --> 00:32:50,068
Before we could find out who...

462
00:32:50,485 --> 00:32:52,335
<i>the terrorists moved up
their plan.

463
00:32:53,923 --> 00:32:55,256
Victor ?

464
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:57,947
We made a mistake,
<i>a very big mistake.</i>

465
00:32:58,989 --> 00:33:01,639
This is the moment we prepared for.

466
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,683
Strike will go off tomorrow,
at precisely 8:05 Eastern.

467
00:33:07,533 --> 00:33:09,133
OK. No... listen !

468
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,200
The trucks...

469
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,750
they're white.

470
00:33:11,883 --> 00:33:16,366
License plate
Kansas, 5-4-3, George, Union, Ida...

471
00:33:16,866 --> 00:33:18,800
<i>I tried to warn the agency...

472
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,600
<i>but we were too late.

473
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,661
Some of the bombs were meant
for New York.

474
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,574
We managed to head them off.

475
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,923
Even after 4 years of work...

476
00:33:37,339 --> 00:33:39,273
I couldn't stop all of them.

477
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:44,270
<i>I'm gonna have to live with that
for the rest of my life.

478
00:34:01,738 --> 00:34:03,505
Since when have
you been funny ?

479
00:34:03,672 --> 00:34:05,339
I have always been funny.

480
00:34:05,805 --> 00:34:07,539
Yeah, not for a long time.

481
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:22,710
What is it Rob ?

482
00:34:26,594 --> 00:34:28,394
- Rob ?
- I won't be long.

483
00:34:38,174 --> 00:34:39,791
Not interrupting, am I ?

484
00:34:40,324 --> 00:34:41,941
You know you are.

485
00:34:42,855 --> 00:34:44,772
You're not exactly
returning our calls.

486
00:34:44,796 --> 00:34:46,530
I told my wife I was done.

487
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:48,730
I promised her, Victor.

488
00:34:50,942 --> 00:34:53,008
- We need you back.
- Why me ?

489
00:34:53,142 --> 00:34:54,742
Because you're the best
at what you do.

490
00:34:54,758 --> 00:34:55,942
Which is what ?

491
00:34:58,325 --> 00:35:00,875
Your family will be there,
when you get back.

492
00:35:02,324 --> 00:35:03,841
Team is meeting tomorrow.

493
00:35:04,515 --> 00:35:06,565
Come listen to what this
is all about.

494
00:35:06,882 --> 00:35:08,773
If you wanna walk
away after that...

495
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,107
you walk away.

496
00:35:14,939 --> 00:35:16,139
2 o'clock...

497
00:35:16,806 --> 00:35:17,806
tomorrow.

498
00:35:18,623 --> 00:35:21,589
Tell the desk jockey you have an
appointment with Mr. Higgins.

499
00:35:22,656 --> 00:35:24,756
If they ask about the weather...

500
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:27,389
tell hem it's gonna rain.

501
00:35:34,584 --> 00:35:35,584
Who was that ?

502
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:49,053
I might need to go
to a meeting tomorow.

503
00:35:50,886 --> 00:35:52,853
I can't keep doing this,
I can't.

504
00:35:54,353 --> 00:35:55,486
We'll be fine, D.

505
00:36:12,642 --> 00:36:13,642
What is that ?

506
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:15,742
It's the end of the
rabbit hole, Jake.

507
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:22,131
Gimme a hand with this.

508
00:36:34,774 --> 00:36:36,308
So you believe me now ?

509
00:37:19,547 --> 00:37:21,413
Is that what I think it is ?

510
00:37:22,747 --> 00:37:25,413
It was meant for Columbus, Ohio.

511
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:29,367
You brought a nuclear bomb...
here.

512
00:37:29,584 --> 00:37:31,467
What would you have
done with it ?

513
00:37:33,117 --> 00:37:34,784
What do you gonna do with it ?

514
00:37:36,604 --> 00:37:38,138
I'm gonna keep it safe.

515
00:37:39,388 --> 00:37:41,988
I'm gonna keep it secret,
you know. Because...

516
00:37:43,225 --> 00:37:47,025
it gives the town some power, Jake,
but it also makes them a target.

517
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:48,291
Look...

518
00:37:51,633 --> 00:37:52,318
I know what you're thinking...

519
00:37:52,518 --> 00:37:55,285
You're wishing you'd walked away
when I gave you the chance, right ?

520
00:37:55,286 --> 00:37:57,780
Why didn’t you show me thing
when I walked in the door today.

521
00:37:57,781 --> 00:37:59,152
You didn't walk in.

522
00:38:00,132 --> 00:38:01,141
<i>Jake ?

523
00:38:03,191 --> 00:38:04,204
<i>Hey, Jake ?

524
00:38:06,816 --> 00:38:08,378
I've been watching you, Jake...

525
00:38:08,462 --> 00:38:10,128
and you can handle yourself.

526
00:38:10,245 --> 00:38:12,712
And I've seen what a help
you have been to this stown.

527
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,874
But I needed to know
that I can trust you.

528
00:38:15,007 --> 00:38:17,724
That you could handle it
if I told you everything.

529
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,590
<i>Jake ?

530
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,040
This bomb...

531
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,912
it's our burden, now.

532
00:38:26,979 --> 00:38:28,579
Whatever happens next...

533
00:38:28,812 --> 00:38:31,562
that is gonna be
up to you. OK ?

534
00:38:56,329 --> 00:38:57,329
He's FBI.

535
00:38:58,162 --> 00:38:59,362
Just like he said.

536
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,079
But...

537
00:39:02,045 --> 00:39:03,379
We're in good hands.

538
00:39:04,929 --> 00:39:06,267
That's good to hear.

539
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:09,739
I'm sorry about all this,
Mr. Hawkins.

540
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:37,588
We do that, outside.

541
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:40,890
I didn't know that.

542
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:46,645
There’s something
I want to say to you.

543
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,164
I'm still learning...

544
00:39:49,551 --> 00:39:51,487
so just, please bear with me.

545
00:39:57,723 --> 00:40:01,129
Stanley...
is...

546
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:04,665
important...
to me.

547
00:40:06,376 --> 00:40:10,608
You... are...
important... to me.

548
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:18,126
I... want... you...
to be safe.

549
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:24,385
So please... be patient...
with me.

550
00:40:24,902 --> 00:40:26,527
I'm trying...

551
00:40:30,023 --> 00:40:31,648
I'll try too.

552
00:40:33,248 --> 00:40:34,255
So...

553
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:36,345
hug ?

554
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:42,073
Right.

555
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,819
I brought you some dinner.

556
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:06,344
Thank you.

557
00:41:33,396 --> 00:41:36,679
<i>You know what, I am damn lucky
that my cover wasn’t blown.

558
00:41:37,118 --> 00:41:39,002
<i>- Your cover's intact ?
- Yeah, we believe so.

559
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,085
<i>Then let's move on.

560
00:41:40,111 --> 00:41:42,537
<i>But at this stage, I recommend
that we take down the cells

561
00:41:42,563 --> 00:41:44,731
<i>that we've already
infiltrated...

562
00:41:45,595 --> 00:41:48,202
<i>How many of the bombs
can you get ?

563
00:42:15,219 --> 00:42:17,619
How many of the bombs
can you get ?

564
