1
00:00:00,311 --> 00:00:01,773
<i>Previously on Jericho...</i>

2
00:00:02,075 --> 00:00:04,451
<i>I'm Major Beck,</i>
10th Mountain Division.

3
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:07,312
I want you to be my liaison
to the people of Jericho.

4
00:00:07,352 --> 00:00:09,864
<i>How's your search
for Sarah Mason going?</i>

5
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:13,806
<i>I'm sending you a private contractor
who knows the area,</i>

6
00:00:13,846 --> 00:00:16,654
<i>who'll take care of the day-to-day
administration of the town</i>

7
00:00:16,694 --> 00:00:18,387
<i>while you find the terrorist.</i>

8
00:00:18,498 --> 00:00:20,291
<i>Hi, Dale!</i>
Where'd you get all this?

9
00:00:20,331 --> 00:00:23,854
Missouri, Nebraska... We've been hitting
the big trading posts in the region.

10
00:00:23,894 --> 00:00:24,902
<i>What's going</i> on?

11
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:26,673
We got word
there was some contraband

12
00:00:26,713 --> 00:00:28,633
in Mr. Turner's
most recent shipment.

13
00:00:28,673 --> 00:00:31,268
This'll all be shipped
back to Cheyenne to be disposed of.

14
00:00:31,308 --> 00:00:33,576
<i>Western states</i> have all
fallen in with Cheyenne.

15
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,409
They're strong
and getting stronger.

16
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:36,637
This is our new mission:

17
00:00:36,677 --> 00:00:39,436
expose Cheyenne's secret
<i>before they take over the whole country.</i>

18
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:42,179
I have the evidence
that could expose the whole cover-up.

19
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:43,606
I have one of the bombs.

20
00:00:43,646 --> 00:00:46,016
<i>Mimi,</i> this is Trish Merrick.
She's with <i>Jennings & Rall</i>.

21
00:00:46,376 --> 00:00:48,449
<i>I cannot wait
to work in that office.</i>

22
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:51,532
You wouldn't believe how organized
the <i>Jennings and Rall</i> people are.

23
00:00:51,572 --> 00:00:52,481
<i>I think...</i>

24
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:54,492
I'm gonna head
to Cheyenne with Trish.

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,410
Yeah?

26
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,329
I'm asking if Sarah Mason
has ever been in the employ

27
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:00,749
- of the U.S. government.
- <i>No. She hasn't.</i>

28
00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:04,129
<i>I accept your offer</i>
to assist my search for Sarah Mason.

29
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,439
<i>What you're doing on my property?</i>

30
00:01:26,057 --> 00:01:27,630
Guys, guys, it's OK.

31
00:01:28,405 --> 00:01:29,280
Stanley...

32
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,251
Sorry about this, we just fix in
a flat tire and we're getting out here.

33
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:34,246
Dale, what the hell
you're doing out here?

34
00:01:34,286 --> 00:01:36,067
You know, importing.

35
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,671
Importing at four o'clock
in the morning?

36
00:01:42,088 --> 00:01:43,093
Here...

37
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:45,811
For looking any other way.

38
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:55,939
Stanley asked me
to return this to you.

39
00:01:56,339 --> 00:01:59,182
Find another way into town.
Quit using his property.

40
00:01:59,222 --> 00:02:01,184
- It's the safest way in.
- It's not suggestion.

41
00:02:01,224 --> 00:02:03,205
It's hard enough getting
past those checkpoints.

42
00:02:03,263 --> 00:02:05,252
You just made it ten times harder.

43
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:07,128
This isn't just about the booze.

44
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,211
The farmers, the merchants,
the clinics, they all need us.

45
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:13,446
If it wasn't for us, every business
in town would be in debt to J&R.

46
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:17,638
What are you doing?

47
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:20,810
Public notice that your business hasn't
yet registered with Jennings & Rall.

48
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,830
- What do you mean, register?
- Simple oversight.

49
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,232
There's still a lot of raiding
going on out on the roads.

50
00:02:25,272 --> 00:02:28,576
Government's asking merchants to prove
they do not business with criminals.

51
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:30,809
You should talk to the sheriff
of theft and corruption

52
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:33,112
running rampant right now.
He should have some insight.

53
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:35,230
When you've you registered,
the notice will come down,

54
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,704
and you'll submit to weekly inspections
of your sales and inventory.

55
00:02:38,744 --> 00:02:39,931
And if he doesn't?

56
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:41,635
Then I'll shut him down.

57
00:03:02,255 --> 00:03:03,257
Yeah?

58
00:03:03,427 --> 00:03:04,539
<i>Hawkins.</i>

59
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,618
<i>You don't have to answer.</i>

60
00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:09,111
<i>I realize
I have some explaining to do.</i>

61
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:11,466
Who are you?

62
00:03:12,095 --> 00:03:14,109
<i>For now, call me John Smith.</i>

63
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:17,302
<i>You don't know me,
but I know about you.</i>

64
00:03:17,387 --> 00:03:18,410
No...

65
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,903
No, you don't know anything.

66
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:25,150
<i>You were tasked on Project Red Bell
with seven other agents.</i>

67
00:03:25,777 --> 00:03:29,069
<i>A member of your own team,
Sarah Mason, betrayed you.</i>

68
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:31,423
<i>I know about Valente.</i>

69
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:34,939
<i>When I saw Chavez
was caught by Major Beck,</i>

70
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:37,749
<i>I figured either you
or Chueng couldn't be far.</i>

71
00:03:38,088 --> 00:03:39,367
<i>So I reached out.</i>

72
00:03:39,816 --> 00:03:41,469
<i>We have goals in common,</i>

73
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:44,115
<i>and I have information
that can help you.</i>

74
00:03:44,619 --> 00:03:47,898
<i>But I want your assurance
that you won't try to find me.</i>

75
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:50,006
<i>Can you accept those terms?</i>

76
00:04:08,518 --> 00:04:10,246
Let's agree on this:

77
00:04:10,753 --> 00:04:12,917
You don't make the terms,

78
00:04:13,423 --> 00:04:14,455
I do.

79
00:04:14,936 --> 00:04:17,042
And if you have information
to share,

80
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:18,905
then you just share it.

81
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:21,899
But if you lie to me,

82
00:04:22,147 --> 00:04:24,273
then know that I will find out,

83
00:04:24,313 --> 00:04:27,956
and the next time we speak,
it will not be on the phone.

84
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,444
Those are the terms.

85
00:04:32,859 --> 00:04:34,052
<i>Agreed.</i>

86
00:04:34,672 --> 00:04:37,404
<i>Now, can we move on
to more urgent business?</i>

87
00:04:38,057 --> 00:04:39,320
I'm listening.

88
00:04:39,636 --> 00:04:40,648
<i>Good.</i>

89
00:04:41,225 --> 00:04:44,425
<i>Because you're a day
away from being caught.</i>

90
00:04:48,216 --> 00:04:50,558
Season 2 Episode 04 <i>- Oversight -</i>

93
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,478
J&R charges an arm
and a leg for stock, but...

94
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:05,285
I can't raise my prices
'cause of Cheyenne's price freeze.

95
00:05:05,615 --> 00:05:08,555
So, buying from Dale
is the only way that I stay in business.

96
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:10,527
Mary's not alone.

97
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:13,042
Matt Carlson
sold his granary yesterday.

98
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,671
I am into these crooks
for 15 grand.

99
00:05:17,264 --> 00:05:18,673
When I tried to go around them

100
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:20,355
to buy feed for my cattle,

101
00:05:20,437 --> 00:05:21,898
they confiscated it,

102
00:05:21,985 --> 00:05:23,599
froze my accounts...

103
00:05:23,997 --> 00:05:25,366
Now my herd is statarving.

104
00:05:25,406 --> 00:05:28,211
Food, supplies.
We're getting strangled here.

105
00:05:28,403 --> 00:05:30,253
If we don't do something,
it will be to late.

106
00:05:30,293 --> 00:05:32,667
We're talking about booze
and cows here.

107
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,815
- The Stamp Act, and the Sugar Act.
- What are you talking about?

108
00:05:35,855 --> 00:05:38,359
The Boston Tea Party...
was it just about tea?

109
00:05:38,878 --> 00:05:39,679
Look,

110
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:42,408
every revolution
that's ever been fought,

111
00:05:42,448 --> 00:05:44,419
they-they started
in roomslike this.

112
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:47,443
- I disagree...
- Right. People have to take a stand...

113
00:05:47,483 --> 00:05:49,454
Look, guys. Listen!

114
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:52,821
We're not talking about
a revolution.

115
00:05:53,235 --> 00:05:55,512
We have a problem to solve,
so let's solve it,

116
00:05:55,626 --> 00:05:58,815
- before it gets out of hand.
- No, J&R is out of hand.

117
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,926
Quiet!

118
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,205
We need a lifeline.

119
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,200
We need to find a way
to funnel in supplies

120
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,029
outside of J&R's control.

121
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:07,801
Dale, he has the trade connections,
he has the trucks.

122
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:08,879
Stanley...

123
00:06:09,597 --> 00:06:11,142
we have to have your farm.

124
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:16,418
Why me? Wh...

125
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,348
There are army checkpoints
all over.

126
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:20,459
Your farm is the safest way
in and out of town...

127
00:06:21,073 --> 00:06:23,529
I am one week away
from having a working farm again.

128
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:25,485
All right?
I need J&R on my side, understand?

129
00:06:25,525 --> 00:06:27,551
So you're gonna leave here
to deal with them alone?

130
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:29,752
Come on.
Guys, this is not Red Dawn.

131
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:31,530
They gave me back my farm.

132
00:06:31,855 --> 00:06:35,458
They forgave my debt.
We've got power again, jobs, food.

133
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:38,033
These people are here to help us,
can't you see that?

134
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:40,004
How? By taking over everything?

135
00:06:41,477 --> 00:06:43,028
What's happened to us?

136
00:06:44,394 --> 00:06:46,354
Gas prices were high
before the bomb.

137
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:48,865
Politicians were crooks,
corporations were evil.

138
00:06:48,905 --> 00:06:51,236
That didn't mean
that we threw in with criminals, did it?

139
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:53,351
Criminals?
If it wasn't for this criminal,

140
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:55,937
you wouldn't be vaccinated
for the Hudson River Virus.

141
00:07:01,328 --> 00:07:02,434
I'm sorry, Jake.

142
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:05,379
I'm out.

143
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,258
Stanley?

144
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,066
Would everybody calm down?
Just calm down a sec, all right?

145
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:16,175
We lost him.

146
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:17,861
What are we going to do now?

147
00:07:18,222 --> 00:07:20,946
We will find you another way
to get into town.

148
00:07:21,144 --> 00:07:22,493
It's going to be okay.

149
00:07:39,428 --> 00:07:40,432
Hey.

150
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,062
You rang?

151
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,692
Tomorrow morning, a binder
will be delivered to Major Beck

152
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:47,682
from an Air Force reconnaissance
unit based in Cheyenne.

153
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:51,713
It'll contain an aerial radiation scan
of this entire area.

154
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,099
The bomb.

155
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:56,739
I-I thought
lead made it undetectable.

156
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:58,430
Oh, this is an advanced system.

157
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,084
Lead is not enough.

158
00:08:00,124 --> 00:08:01,553
Well, then we need to move it.

159
00:08:01,704 --> 00:08:04,313
The scan will get Beck closer,
but not all the way.

160
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:06,987
You see, anything with a high
enough atomic weight will present

161
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:08,676
in the same way as plutonium.

162
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:11,427
He's still got to search
the hot spots one at a time.

163
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:14,350
This cabin is going to be
one of those hot spots.

164
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:16,684
How do you know all this?

165
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:20,057
Only a hard copy
would have been sent.

166
00:08:20,097 --> 00:08:22,382
They're not going to take any chances
with the Internet.

167
00:08:22,558 --> 00:08:25,618
Now, that binder will be
in Beck's office with his secure files.

168
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:28,905
I need the page from the binder
that'll identify the bomb.

169
00:08:29,105 --> 00:08:31,895
- I'm guessing that's my job.
- Within 24 hours, Jake.

170
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:33,402
48, at the most.

171
00:08:33,627 --> 00:08:37,292
Before they got a chance to process
the data and map the hot spots.

172
00:08:37,563 --> 00:08:40,137
Well, you got a plan
for getting Beck out of his office?

173
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:41,505
Matter of fact...

174
00:08:41,716 --> 00:08:42,725
I do.

175
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:45,806
- Did you get the gas?
- Yeah, it's out by the car.

176
00:08:45,846 --> 00:08:47,046
Where are you going?

177
00:08:47,455 --> 00:08:49,470
I gotta burn down a house.

178
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,664
<i>If you are here to register,
you can get in line.</i>

179
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:03,231
<i>For currency exchange,</i>

180
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:06,908
<i>please have your two pieces
of identification out and ready.</i>

181
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,780
Mimi. I thought you were
doing the books from home today.

182
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,781
All finished.

183
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:14,541
Listen, I am so glad we have
you on board, I can't even tell you.

184
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:16,530
Well, don't speak too soon.

185
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,617
I found something odd
and I wanted to check my...

186
00:09:19,657 --> 00:09:21,499
ledger against the J&R books.

187
00:09:21,673 --> 00:09:22,621
What is it?

188
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:25,330
All the outgoing totals
you gave me match up,

189
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,995
until the new currency arrived.
Then suddenly,

190
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,781
there's a $10,000 discrepancy.

191
00:09:31,426 --> 00:09:33,241
I'm sure it's just
an accounting error.

192
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,912
Perhaps Jennings & Rall

193
00:09:34,952 --> 00:09:38,182
didn't deliver as much
of the new currency as their books say.

194
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,650
Oh, J&R is meticulous
about accounting.

195
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,450
They wouldn't make
a mistake like that.

196
00:09:44,476 --> 00:09:46,047
Then someone took it.

197
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:49,741
How? I mean,
it came off the armored truck,

198
00:09:49,781 --> 00:09:52,086
it checked into Jennings & Rall.
And it's been...

199
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:53,573
under armed guard ever since.

200
00:09:53,613 --> 00:09:55,616
I guess you have
to figure out who had access.

201
00:09:56,538 --> 00:09:57,994
You know what? Don't worry.

202
00:09:58,034 --> 00:09:59,838
It's probably just a mistake.

203
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:01,145
I'll take care of it.

204
00:10:15,153 --> 00:10:16,762
It's Fort Knox back there.

205
00:10:19,055 --> 00:10:20,150
What is that?

206
00:10:20,242 --> 00:10:21,616
Thumbprint scanner.

207
00:10:21,811 --> 00:10:25,098
Getting that room ready
to house classified information.

208
00:10:25,314 --> 00:10:28,262
It's a pretty short list
of people that'll have access.

209
00:10:28,373 --> 00:10:30,345
Let me guess, I'm not on it?

210
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,079
But, if it's any consolation,

211
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,787
you now hold the distinction
of being the first

212
00:10:36,827 --> 00:10:38,744
Jericho sheriff in history.

213
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:40,828
Who doesn't have a key
to the sheriff's office.

214
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,162
Who does have access?

215
00:10:43,202 --> 00:10:44,457
Just the officers.

216
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,229
There's a list floating
around here.

217
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:52,537
Yeah.

218
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,050
Here you go.

219
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:08,484
<i>And here you go.</i>

220
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:16,307
Tell the lieutenant that...
the data's arrived.

221
00:11:16,585 --> 00:11:19,682
I'll be wanting to get into it
as soon as possible.

222
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,508
So how many curfew violations
are we talking about?

223
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,476
Twelve within the New Bern city limits
since Tuesday.

224
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:31,640
That sounds about
par for the course.

225
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,287
Yeah, it's not the number
I'm worried about.

226
00:11:35,631 --> 00:11:37,622
Britt Daniels, Randy Pope.

227
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:39,739
These six men here
all worked in the factory

228
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:41,639
making munitions whe I was there.

229
00:11:42,071 --> 00:11:44,016
Things are getting tense there,
right?

230
00:11:44,097 --> 00:11:46,560
Random violence,
friction with the J&R reps...

231
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,118
Yes.

232
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,156
I'm worried these aren't
random curfew violations.

233
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:53,214
It feels more organized to me.

234
00:11:54,203 --> 00:11:55,569
They're testing the fence.

235
00:11:57,478 --> 00:11:58,948
We'll monitor it.

236
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,907
Heather.

237
00:12:01,656 --> 00:12:02,717
Thank you.

238
00:12:24,456 --> 00:12:26,229
Forget him, too anxious.

239
00:12:27,426 --> 00:12:30,303
Callahan's expecting
a field promotion.

240
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:32,205
He won't risk it.

241
00:12:33,414 --> 00:12:35,434
Foster's dumb as a stump.

242
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,887
Put him down as a maybe.

243
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,329
How do you know all this?

244
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:44,427
Soldiers that man
these checkpoints hang out at her bar.

245
00:12:44,615 --> 00:12:46,044
Making friends is my business.

246
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:49,564
Skylar says you wanted to see me.

247
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:52,258
Yeah.

248
00:12:52,634 --> 00:12:56,213
You were driving through Stanley's land
to avoid all the checkpoints, right?

249
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,365
Yeah.

250
00:12:57,495 --> 00:12:59,714
Well, what if you didn't have
to avoid them?

251
00:12:59,855 --> 00:13:02,219
What if you could drive
right through them?

252
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:12,911
I'm told you have information

253
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:16,066
about who's been smuggling stolen
goods into town.

254
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:17,990
Before I say anything,

255
00:13:18,574 --> 00:13:21,363
I want to know I'm going
to be able to keep my business.

256
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:24,433
I've got a family to think about.

257
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:32,666
Well, Fred,

258
00:13:33,476 --> 00:13:35,503
I'm sure
we can work something out.

259
00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:39,648
The kid.

260
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:41,199
Dale Turner.

261
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,637
He's the key to the whole thing.

262
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:57,837
What?

263
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:00,653
I can't get it.

264
00:14:01,017 --> 00:14:03,512
- I can't get the binder.
- What do you mean?

265
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:05,591
I mean,
short of cutting off someone's thumb,

266
00:14:05,631 --> 00:14:07,387
I can't get into Beck's office.

267
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:08,853
Plan's in motion, Jake.

268
00:14:08,893 --> 00:14:11,330
Things change in the field,
you've just got to adapt.

269
00:14:15,851 --> 00:14:18,140
There is someone.
And Beck trusts her.

270
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,700
She's been monitoring
his field reports from New Bern.

271
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,506
She can get close to the data

272
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,930
without being detected,
but she's smart.

273
00:14:25,688 --> 00:14:27,122
We're going to have to tell her.

274
00:14:27,427 --> 00:14:30,015
- Tell her what?
- Tell her why we need the page.

275
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:32,136
Oh, there you go again.

276
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:33,558
Every time we hit a snag,

277
00:14:33,598 --> 00:14:35,918
your answer is just to bring
somebody else in.

278
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,038
You can trust her.

279
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:38,844
You said the same thing
of this journalist.

280
00:14:38,884 --> 00:14:41,402
You think I don't know that?
I care about this person.

281
00:14:41,442 --> 00:14:43,063
I don't. And you see this?

282
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:44,574
This is not some secret club

283
00:14:44,614 --> 00:14:46,977
where we just invite people
in when it is convenient.

284
00:14:47,017 --> 00:14:48,663
Why don't you tell me what to do?!

285
00:14:48,703 --> 00:14:49,806
Just tell me!

286
00:14:49,924 --> 00:14:51,738
Eight people have access
to that room

287
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:53,318
and seven of them are military.

288
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,698
Now, if you want to get in there
in the next 24 hours,

289
00:14:55,738 --> 00:14:56,845
you show me!

290
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,231
Show me how!

291
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:07,537
Now,

292
00:15:07,577 --> 00:15:10,861
I feel as though I'm being a pretty
good sport about all this, but,

293
00:15:11,074 --> 00:15:13,885
I mean at some point you're going
to explain what we're doing here, right?

294
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:14,725
Yeah.

295
00:15:18,814 --> 00:15:20,801
- Hey. She here?
- Yeah.

296
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:34,308
I'm going to ask for your help today.

297
00:15:35,287 --> 00:15:38,548
And that requires that you be told some
very dangerous information.

298
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:42,380
You should know that there's only five
people outside of the Cheyenne

299
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,432
Government who know what it is
that I'm about to tell you.

300
00:15:45,731 --> 00:15:49,435
And that there are those that will
kill to prevent it from coming to light.

301
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:53,108
Why would I agree to that?

302
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:57,204
You already put your life
on the line for this town,

303
00:15:57,244 --> 00:15:59,343
and the last thing
that I want to do is...

304
00:15:59,746 --> 00:16:01,521
is to ask you to do it again, but...

305
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:05,968
I feel like if you understand
what's at stake, you'll want to help.

306
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:07,083
What's at stake?

307
00:16:07,127 --> 00:16:09,133
I believe it's the future
of our country.

308
00:16:15,492 --> 00:16:16,476
Heather...

309
00:16:19,027 --> 00:16:20,917
Do you want me to keep talking?

310
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:37,219
I'm listening.

311
00:16:44,547 --> 00:16:45,878
You wanted to see me, Trish?

312
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:48,520
Yes. I wanted to talk to you
about an accounting issue.

313
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,524
Work, it's boring.

314
00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:53,443
I don't believe we've met.

315
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:55,128
Bonnie Richmond.

316
00:16:55,385 --> 00:16:56,504
This is John Goetz.

317
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:58,387
He's our Administrator.

318
00:17:02,336 --> 00:17:03,860
What was it you needed me for?

319
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:06,870
It's come to my attention that
since we've issued the new currency,

320
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:08,494
some money may have gone missing.

321
00:17:08,534 --> 00:17:09,845
Really? How much?

322
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:11,271
$10,000.

323
00:17:12,905 --> 00:17:16,100
Here's my incident report so that
you can start a formal investigation.

324
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,022
Where exactly did you get
your information?

325
00:17:18,073 --> 00:17:21,566
The accountant that we hired locally,
she found the discrepancy.

326
00:17:21,732 --> 00:17:22,956
Maybe she made a mistake.

327
00:17:22,996 --> 00:17:25,204
Sometimes a local hire
doesn't have the whole picture.

328
00:17:25,403 --> 00:17:27,196
She keeps a set of books to herself

329
00:17:27,236 --> 00:17:29,994
so that she can check
them against the J&R books.

330
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:32,979
She believes that the J&R
books may have been altered.

331
00:17:34,024 --> 00:17:34,892
I see.

332
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,470
Look, you and I both know

333
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,040
how seriously J&R
takes embezzling.

334
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,927
Zero tolerance.

335
00:17:43,842 --> 00:17:45,899
For the sake of both of our jobs,

336
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,124
I believe that it's important
that we handle this correctly.

337
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:52,252
You're absolutely right. Thank you
for bringing this to my attention.

338
00:17:52,343 --> 00:17:54,176
I'm going to look into this right away.

339
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:04,560
Here you go, Timmy.

340
00:18:05,232 --> 00:18:06,254
Thank you, ma'am.

341
00:18:08,633 --> 00:18:09,984
Got word from Jane yet?

342
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,900
Nah.

343
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:13,675
Battalion S-2's being a real
Jerk about mail from the East.

344
00:18:13,715 --> 00:18:15,402
Says it's a security risk.

345
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:16,823
Appreciate you asking.

346
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:19,678
She must miss the hell out of you.

347
00:18:20,453 --> 00:18:23,805
Don't worry, soon as my tour's through,
she'll get enough of me.

348
00:18:27,114 --> 00:18:28,407
How's business?

349
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,724
It's hard to keep the shelves
stocked with you boys around.

350
00:18:32,132 --> 00:18:34,428
Just make sure there's
a bourbon waiting for me later.

351
00:18:35,088 --> 00:18:36,419
Well, I'll try.

352
00:18:36,872 --> 00:18:38,210
I'm running pretty low.

353
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,669
You gonna be at your checkpoint tonight?

354
00:18:42,577 --> 00:18:43,617
Yes, ma'am.

355
00:18:43,884 --> 00:18:45,292
'Cause I could make a call.

356
00:18:45,637 --> 00:18:47,923
Maybe you could look the
other way for just one truck.

357
00:18:51,812 --> 00:18:53,498
You're asking me to commit a crime.

358
00:18:53,856 --> 00:18:55,264
Just booze.

359
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:02,001
Just booze?

360
00:19:07,152 --> 00:19:08,271
Yeah, all right.

361
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,504
You got it.

362
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:12,702
Thanks, Timmy.

363
00:19:28,795 --> 00:19:30,396
Not your lucky day, kid.

364
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:39,622
The government,
the army and the news,

365
00:19:40,111 --> 00:19:42,735
they're all lying about who's
responsible for the attacks?

366
00:19:42,804 --> 00:19:43,604
Yes.

367
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:46,348
But you're telling the truth?

368
00:19:47,505 --> 00:19:48,305
Yeah.

369
00:19:50,271 --> 00:19:51,351
Who are you?

370
00:19:55,137 --> 00:19:55,937
Okay.

371
00:19:56,535 --> 00:19:57,886
Okay, okay, all right.

372
00:20:00,913 --> 00:20:02,971
- What do you want me to do?
- All right,

373
00:20:03,682 --> 00:20:05,982
there's a binder
in Beck's office.

374
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:07,940
We need you to remove one page from it.

375
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:10,271
- Beck's involved in this, too?!
- Not directly, no.

376
00:20:10,312 --> 00:20:12,520
- Beck's a good man.
- Yes, he is,

377
00:20:12,784 --> 00:20:16,719
but he is taking orders from some very
bad people in the Cheyenne government.

378
00:20:19,781 --> 00:20:21,016
What's in the binder?

379
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:23,794
Data from an aerial radiation survey.

380
00:20:25,048 --> 00:20:26,012
Radiation?

381
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,204
Radiation?
What the hell's going on here?

382
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:30,312
Do you trust me?

383
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,379
Do you trust me?

384
00:20:34,113 --> 00:20:35,187
- Yes.
- All right.

385
00:20:35,227 --> 00:20:38,234
This has to happen today. Hawkins
is gonna get Beck out of his office.

386
00:20:38,297 --> 00:20:40,631
I'm sorry
for dragging you into this.

387
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,996
There's no other way.

388
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:50,979
Okay.

389
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:09,433
Mr. Hawkins.

390
00:21:09,891 --> 00:21:11,523
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.

391
00:21:12,463 --> 00:21:15,049
I was,
wondering when I'd hear from you next.

392
00:21:15,168 --> 00:21:17,560
How quickly can you
deploy some men to Nebraska?

393
00:21:17,816 --> 00:21:19,070
Why? What's in Nebraska?

394
00:21:19,207 --> 00:21:20,454
I have an informant,

395
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,197
part of a road gang
operating along I-80.

396
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:27,271
He just confirmed a visual I.D.
on Sarah Mason.

397
00:21:29,475 --> 00:21:30,361
Doing what?

398
00:21:30,812 --> 00:21:32,954
She was spotted at a remote farmhouse.

399
00:21:33,531 --> 00:21:35,014
It's probably a safe house.

400
00:21:35,492 --> 00:21:37,392
- Is this reliable intel?
- Major,

401
00:21:37,786 --> 00:21:40,043
Mason doesn't stay in the same place
for too long.

402
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:41,683
So can we move on this?

403
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:49,310
- Lieutenant.
- Sir.

404
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,628
I need a patrol on me.

405
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,778
Radio Camp Liberty, tell 'em I want
two Apaches on ready standby.

406
00:21:54,818 --> 00:21:55,834
Roger that.

407
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,114
California?

408
00:22:05,218 --> 00:22:08,071
Yeah, I'll expect a postcard
at least once a week, okay,

409
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,013
preferably with girls in bikinis

410
00:22:10,315 --> 00:22:11,955
And if they're naked,

411
00:22:12,014 --> 00:22:14,300
- that's even better.

412
00:22:28,939 --> 00:22:31,107
They must have caught him smuggling.

413
00:22:40,298 --> 00:22:42,248
This isn't right. Let's go.

414
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,082
Take it around again,
Captain, we have to be sure.

415
00:24:26,235 --> 00:24:27,035
Out.

416
00:24:27,855 --> 00:24:28,685
Major,

417
00:24:29,471 --> 00:24:30,271
anything?

418
00:24:30,311 --> 00:24:32,941
No sign of Mason anywhere,
and we got helos all over the state.

419
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,182
Sir, definitely an Arson job.

420
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:38,379
We also found spent bullet casings
from two different weapons.

421
00:24:38,698 --> 00:24:41,231
- Somebody had a shootout.
- What about the body you found?

422
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,142
Burnt to a crisp, but judging
from the bone structure, it's male.

423
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:47,086
- DNA sample's on its way to be scanned.
- Another dead end, I'm sure.

424
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:49,713
The fire melted all the
computer equipment in the house,

425
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:51,726
but we found this hidden
behind the basement wall.

426
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:53,566
Some sort of hard drive.
Looks salvageable.

427
00:24:58,491 --> 00:24:59,822
What do you make of all this?

428
00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:02,170
I think Mason came
here to tie up a loose end.

429
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,757
I think this fire was supposed
to be thorough, and...

430
00:25:05,982 --> 00:25:07,467
I think she missed something.

431
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:10,934
I want to see what's on it.
Take it to the techs right away.

432
00:25:10,974 --> 00:25:11,817
Yes, sir.

433
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:14,460
What are you doing in here?

434
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,192
We want Dale Turner.

435
00:26:20,659 --> 00:26:21,701
Get him out here.

436
00:26:23,517 --> 00:26:24,809
Can't do it, Sheriff.

437
00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:27,494
This is not a Jail
and you don't just hold people.

438
00:26:27,703 --> 00:26:30,176
If Dale's accused of a crime,
the Sheriff office will investigate.

439
00:26:30,216 --> 00:26:31,409
That won't be necessary.

440
00:26:31,449 --> 00:26:33,925
A truck full of contraband
meets my burden of proof.

441
00:26:34,206 --> 00:26:36,173
- You can't keep him here forever.
- I agree.

442
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,488
I turned him over to the
military police ten minutes ago.

443
00:26:38,528 --> 00:26:41,001
He's on his way to Loomer
Ridge Prison as we speak.

444
00:26:41,989 --> 00:26:43,320
You sent him to prison?

445
00:26:43,413 --> 00:26:45,712
The kid is guilty.
The authority is mine.

446
00:26:45,752 --> 00:26:46,981
I'm sending a message.

447
00:26:47,055 --> 00:26:49,004
There's no place for thieves in Jericho.

448
00:27:05,648 --> 00:27:07,524
If saying throw us in prison
whenever he wants,

449
00:27:07,564 --> 00:27:10,244
- makes you think that stops with Dale?
- The vaccines, registrations,

450
00:27:10,284 --> 00:27:11,587
the gouging, now this.

451
00:27:11,627 --> 00:27:12,791
We're losing this town.

452
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,193
We got to get there, right?
They got a ten-minute head start.

453
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:17,312
Chasing truck is the way
of getting ourselves shot at.

454
00:27:17,352 --> 00:27:20,083
Probably. Go find Beck.
I need you to relay a message.

455
00:27:20,123 --> 00:27:22,263
What he say. He don't have
the authority to do anything.

456
00:27:22,303 --> 00:27:24,082
We're going to give him the authority.

457
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:27,179
At ease. What's going on?

458
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:29,270
Sir, I found this woman in your office.

459
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:32,882
She has clearance to be in this office.
What's the problem?

460
00:27:32,922 --> 00:27:35,341
I believe she was accessing
secure information, sir,

461
00:27:35,383 --> 00:27:37,155
outside her area of clearance.

462
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,954
Were you looking at anything in
my office other than the New Bern files?

463
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,031
No, I wasn't.

464
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,525
I needed to check
something in your inbox.

465
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:56,366
Problem solved.
Thanks for your help Sergeant.

466
00:27:56,406 --> 00:27:59,430
Sir, with all due respect, I don't
believe her to be telling the truth.

467
00:28:03,793 --> 00:28:06,414
I believe she is telling the truth.
Are you questioning my judgment?

468
00:28:06,454 --> 00:28:07,504
No, sir.

469
00:28:08,282 --> 00:28:09,638
You're dismissed.

470
00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:10,874
Yes, sir.

471
00:28:15,605 --> 00:28:16,742
Thank you.

472
00:28:17,006 --> 00:28:18,987
Thank you? My apologies.

473
00:28:19,987 --> 00:28:22,996
I hope the sergeant's actions haven't
colored your faith in this office.

474
00:28:23,042 --> 00:28:24,474
I'd consider that a crime.

475
00:28:39,642 --> 00:28:41,147
Let me do the talking.

476
00:28:43,941 --> 00:28:45,156
Keep your hands up.

477
00:28:45,277 --> 00:28:46,810
- Clear the road.
- Right...

478
00:28:47,303 --> 00:28:48,480
there's been a mistake.

479
00:28:48,771 --> 00:28:51,125
And I'm the Sheriff,
the kid should be in my custody.

480
00:28:51,249 --> 00:28:53,779
- Clear the road or I will shoot.
- I have orders from Major Beck!

481
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:55,098
This is your last warning.

482
00:28:55,138 --> 00:28:56,860
Radio Major Beck,
10th Mountain Division.

483
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,398
- This is not the way I get orders.
- Just call him. He'll explain.

484
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:01,209
Clear the road or I am opening fire.

485
00:29:03,528 --> 00:29:04,328
Sir.

486
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:08,336
A major from Headquarters
is on the horn.

487
00:29:14,146 --> 00:29:14,946
Sir?

488
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:17,591
Yes, sir, he is.

489
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:20,717
Yes, sir.

490
00:29:21,609 --> 00:29:22,825
He wants to talk to you.

491
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:33,842
Major?

492
00:29:33,882 --> 00:29:36,034
<i>You mind telling me
what you think you're doing?</i>

493
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:37,277
Major, I need your help.

494
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:40,129
<i>Your brother tells me you
want me to identify a 16-year-old kid</i>

495
00:29:40,187 --> 00:29:42,983
<i>with no discernible value
as a confidential terror informant.</i>

496
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,797
But if he's a part
of your investigation,

497
00:29:44,842 --> 00:29:46,887
then Goetz loses all authority over him.

498
00:29:46,927 --> 00:29:48,824
<i>- Are you out of your mind?</i>
- He's a kid.

499
00:29:48,864 --> 00:29:51,301
He's a 16-year-old kid and Goetz
is sending him to prison with

500
00:29:51,341 --> 00:29:53,101
no judge, no trial, nothing.

501
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,310
It's a mistake,

502
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,329
and you have the ability to do something
about it, so I'm asking you to help.

503
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:05,846
<i>Put the lieutenant back on.</i>

504
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:08,573
Major...

505
00:30:08,703 --> 00:30:09,909
<i>Put him on.</i>

506
00:30:22,978 --> 00:30:23,942
Yes, sir.

507
00:30:30,427 --> 00:30:31,677
Bring him up here.

508
00:31:04,627 --> 00:31:05,920
It's Mimi, right?

509
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,010
Yes.

510
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:10,734
Trish told me you're concerned
some money may have gone missing.

511
00:31:10,816 --> 00:31:12,386
I'd like to see your math on that.

512
00:31:12,727 --> 00:31:14,290
Sure...

513
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,976
Trish has the ledger
with the discrepancy in it.

514
00:31:18,258 --> 00:31:20,264
I saw her book, the numbers looked fine.

515
00:31:20,455 --> 00:31:22,850
Well, they do unless you compare
them with my ledger,

516
00:31:23,043 --> 00:31:25,387
in which case the numbers
are different entirely.

517
00:31:25,991 --> 00:31:28,576
- I'd like to see your ledger.
- I keep that at home, but

518
00:31:28,673 --> 00:31:31,636
I did make some notations
in the margins of the J&R book

519
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:35,368
and you see that our numbers started to
diverge when the new currency arrived.

520
00:31:36,232 --> 00:31:38,355
Please don't take this the wrong way,
Mimi, but

521
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,863
I can't just take your word for it.

522
00:31:40,987 --> 00:31:42,376
I need to see the ledger.

523
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,549
Well, please don't take
this the wrong way,

524
00:31:44,665 --> 00:31:48,195
but in order to provide independent
oversight, I need to be independent.

525
00:31:48,249 --> 00:31:51,286
You're accusing someone
in this company of embezzlement.

526
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:54,448
- That's a very serious charge.
- I'm not accusing anyone.

527
00:31:57,602 --> 00:32:00,458
I'm the chief administrator
of this town and I want your ledger.

528
00:32:00,663 --> 00:32:03,384
Valuable information like
that should be kept in a safe place,

529
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:07,020
not at home where practically
anything could happen to it.

530
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,633
Well, I will bring it tomorrow.

531
00:32:12,242 --> 00:32:13,301
Thank you.

532
00:32:16,338 --> 00:32:17,569
Excuse me, please.

533
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,274
What do we got?

534
00:32:30,569 --> 00:32:32,102
Quite a lot, sir. Take a look.

535
00:32:33,389 --> 00:32:36,508
On the hard drive recovered from
the fire, we found transcripts of

536
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,374
secured communication
between the suspect

537
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:41,129
Sarah Mason and a boss,
so far unidentified.

538
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:46,304
"Target successfully terminated."
She was an assassin?

539
00:32:46,657 --> 00:32:48,505
They discuss five
murders in the messages.

540
00:32:48,602 --> 00:32:50,188
Then it gets really interesting.

541
00:32:51,449 --> 00:32:52,645
Looks like she turned.

542
00:32:53,023 --> 00:32:55,994
Here she and her boss discuss the
sale of a "package" in her possession.

543
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,631
Mason sold the bomb?

544
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,580
Almost.

545
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,542
A meet was arranged in Nebraska,
but she balked at the last second.

546
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,296
- Why?
- Unclear.

547
00:33:03,336 --> 00:33:05,512
However, it looks like she used a meet
to track her buyer

548
00:33:05,552 --> 00:33:07,336
back to his base of operations.

549
00:33:07,629 --> 00:33:09,405
Sir, there's even surveillance.

550
00:33:22,887 --> 00:33:24,526
Lieutenant, you're excused.

551
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:26,067
Sir?

552
00:33:26,107 --> 00:33:27,193
Leave the room. Now.

553
00:33:27,233 --> 00:33:28,220
Yes, sir.

554
00:33:56,484 --> 00:33:58,179
Well, it confirms my hunch.

555
00:33:58,739 --> 00:34:00,283
Mason was Black Ops.

556
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:04,144
And these murders look like a
clean-up to me, like some kind of

557
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,833
top secret operation gone bad.

558
00:34:07,115 --> 00:34:09,122
So anyone connected to it has to die.

559
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:12,252
Safe to say,
she killed that John Doe at the house.

560
00:34:12,292 --> 00:34:14,015
Probably on the orders of this...

561
00:34:14,478 --> 00:34:15,867
same boss.

562
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:19,338
So the question now is,
what exactly are they cleaning up?

563
00:34:20,364 --> 00:34:23,161
We might have missed this entirely
if it wasn't for your informant.

564
00:34:27,143 --> 00:34:29,227
There was no informant, was there?

565
00:34:31,328 --> 00:34:32,808
Sorry. Excuse me?

566
00:34:32,903 --> 00:34:35,045
After our trip,
I checked with my field commanders.

567
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:38,735
They confirmed that, there
was a nasty road gang in that region.

568
00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:41,619
Problem is we smashed
up that operation weeks ago.

569
00:34:41,687 --> 00:34:43,409
The area's been quiet ever since.

570
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,679
So what are you saying?

571
00:34:45,158 --> 00:34:47,724
Think twice before you say another word.

572
00:34:48,867 --> 00:34:52,340
Ever since you waltzed into my office,
you know everything I know.

573
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,552
Every question I had, you had an answer.

574
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:56,041
And then today.

575
00:34:56,663 --> 00:34:58,302
The tip from your C.I.

576
00:34:58,475 --> 00:35:00,386
The fire. The hard drive.

577
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:02,287
You think I'm an idiot?

578
00:35:04,842 --> 00:35:06,057
It was too easy.

579
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,505
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't kick

580
00:35:10,545 --> 00:35:12,678
in the door
to your house right now?

581
00:35:17,736 --> 00:35:20,263
What else did you
find on that hard drive?

582
00:35:21,907 --> 00:35:23,084
You know what's there.

583
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,050
No.

584
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:25,603
I don't.

585
00:35:27,895 --> 00:35:30,615
I think you found something
that you don't want to believe, though.

586
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,169
That what this is?

587
00:35:35,988 --> 00:35:37,377
This a test, Major?

588
00:35:48,865 --> 00:35:50,235
What am I looking at?

589
00:35:51,777 --> 00:35:53,856
That's Thomas Valente on the right.

590
00:35:56,986 --> 00:35:59,224
As in the Department
of Homeland Security?

591
00:36:00,008 --> 00:36:01,125
He lied to me.

592
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:05,037
Sarah Mason did work for the government.

593
00:36:06,342 --> 00:36:07,558
She worked for him.

594
00:36:34,137 --> 00:36:35,874
Is there something wrong?

595
00:36:35,992 --> 00:36:39,104
I found out that someone
is stealing money from J&R,

596
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:43,053
and I think that they know
that I'm on to them.

597
00:36:57,846 --> 00:36:59,156
Oh, my God.

598
00:37:02,254 --> 00:37:05,024
- Don't make any noise.
- What's going on?

599
00:37:05,064 --> 00:37:06,998
It's Ravenwood. They're outside.

600
00:37:07,062 --> 00:37:08,161
Anybody in there?

601
00:37:08,987 --> 00:37:11,630
If you are, you need to
come out here and talk to me.

602
00:37:12,455 --> 00:37:13,727
What do they want?

603
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:14,962
The ledger.

604
00:37:15,116 --> 00:37:17,334
I saw them take Dale today.

605
00:37:17,606 --> 00:37:19,999
What if they don't just want the ledger?

606
00:37:20,276 --> 00:37:22,741
- I'll tell them you're not here.
- No, Bonnie, don't go outside.

607
00:37:22,781 --> 00:37:24,263
Bonnie! Bonnie!

608
00:37:32,276 --> 00:37:33,241
Ma'am.

609
00:37:35,328 --> 00:37:36,312
Bonnie, right?

610
00:37:38,922 --> 00:37:40,466
Is Mimi Clark inside?

611
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:42,182
I'd really like to talk to her.

612
00:37:42,781 --> 00:37:44,498
Sorry. She's not here.

613
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,324
I'm going to have a look inside.

614
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,612
- They're coming.
- Come on! Come. Come.

615
00:38:07,031 --> 00:38:08,686
Bonnie, hide! Bonnie!

616
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:51,062
<i>Is the bomb secure?</i>

617
00:39:54,217 --> 00:39:55,240
Yeah, it is.

618
00:39:57,104 --> 00:39:58,551
And thanks for the warning.

619
00:40:00,586 --> 00:40:01,943

00:40:02,341 --> 00:40:03,962

624
00:40:10,177 --> 00:40:11,733

What?

626
00:40:15,803 --> 00:40:17,213
You mean Jennings & Rall?

627
00:40:17,891 --> 00:40:20,609
What are you saying, they
got something to do with the attacks?

628
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,969
No, that doesn't compute.

629
00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:27,995
Corporations don't overthrow
governments that enrich them.

630

632
00:40:33,012 --> 00:40:34,710
<i>It's all right to admit ignorance.</i>

00:40:34,867 --> 00:40:35,986

637

638
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:51,641
