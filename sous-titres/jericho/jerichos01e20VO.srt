00:00:00,297 --> 00:00:01,578
<i>Previously on</i> Jericho

2
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:03,127
We're the United States Marines

3
00:00:03,227 --> 00:00:05,194
and we're here to help.
- Lance Corporal Mullen.

4
00:00:05,335 --> 00:00:07,103
- Jake.
- Maggie.

5
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:10,920
They've got somebody on the edge of town
pretending to be their headquarters.

6
00:00:11,024 --> 00:00:12,669
- Is any of this real?
- The gun's real.

7
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:14,137
Hands up!
Get 'em up!

8
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:15,749
You're a smart girl.

9
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,060
You need to get out before
these guys get you killed.

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,164
And go where?

11
00:00:19,264 --> 00:00:20,822
Justin, you SOB.

12
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:22,876
How the hell did you lose an election?

13
00:00:22,976 --> 00:00:25,442
The question is how did you get
to be in charge of New Bern?

14
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:26,994
They get tired of you being sheriff?

15
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:29,600
No, I'm still sheriff.
Just got a little more authority.

16
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,649
This thing work?
We get power from it?

17
00:00:31,749 --> 00:00:32,877
Probably sometime tomorrow.

18
00:00:32,977 --> 00:00:34,457
Let's get it up as fast as we can.

19
00:00:34,557 --> 00:00:35,821
Can we buy some more
of these things?

20
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:38,431
You got one of the only salt
mines around for 400 miles.

21
00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:39,574
We're gonna need food.

22
00:00:39,674 --> 00:00:41,576
Ten wind turbines
for let's say...

23
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:43,082
ten percent of your spring crop.

24
00:00:43,182 --> 00:00:44,895
Okay, we'll give you the food.

25
00:00:44,995 --> 00:00:47,252
We're gonna need ten Jericho men
to help us build it.

26
00:00:47,627 --> 00:00:51,492
What you are about to do
means this town's survival.

27
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:52,743
All right, let's move out.

28
00:00:52,974 --> 00:00:55,040
Anything happens to any of them...

29
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:56,589
you're the first one I come for.

30
00:00:57,192 --> 00:00:59,080
I didn't know you guys
were coming back today.

31
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,633
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.

32
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:03,105
- Where's my brother?
- He hasn't been seen for a few days.

33
00:01:03,144 --> 00:01:06,349
<i>You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china.

34
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,774
It's a full inventory of Jericho.

35
00:01:08,907 --> 00:01:10,675
They sliceit up like they own it.

36
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:12,161
They're making mortar rounds.

37
00:01:12,268 --> 00:01:13,696
They're getting ready for war.

38
00:01:13,796 --> 00:01:14,800
Hold it!

39
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:37,630
Come on.

40
00:01:43,742 --> 00:01:44,916
This doesn't look good.

41
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,918
It could turn into a
full-blown riot.

42
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:49,481
As our guys show up,
you keep them back out of sight.

43
00:01:49,581 --> 00:01:51,837
I don't want those New Bern
guys getting trigger-happy.

44
00:01:51,973 --> 00:01:53,996
This salt mine is
private property!

45
00:01:54,402 --> 00:01:56,687
You have 30 seconds to
get the hell out of here!

46
00:02:31,647 --> 00:02:33,133
What did I tell you, Ted?

47
00:02:33,243 --> 00:02:34,244
Sorry.

48
00:02:35,777 --> 00:02:36,793
I knew it was you.

49
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:38,938
Yeah, but if it wasn't me...

50
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,144
you just gave up my name.

51
00:02:50,138 --> 00:02:52,341
I want you to tell me
who your friend is

52
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:54,019
and where I can find him.

53
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,451
Things are gonna get
very bad for you

54
00:03:00,686 --> 00:03:03,064
and your brother,
vxyou don't help us, Jake.

55
00:03:04,574 --> 00:03:05,979
Why would I want to help you?

56
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:07,546
This is what I know...

57
00:03:07,844 --> 00:03:10,880
is that you, your friend
and your brother

58
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,960
were caught attempting to sabotage
this town's sole means of manufacture.

59
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,626
Manufacturing weapons. You were man...

60
00:03:15,726 --> 00:03:17,402
So I'm gonna
repeat the question:

61
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:19,736
Where is your friend?

62
00:03:24,815 --> 00:03:27,975
Why don't you tell me what
vvhappened to Heather Lisinski?

63
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:32,115
Take him back.

64
00:03:32,256 --> 00:03:33,257
Let's go, boy.

65
00:03:34,384 --> 00:03:35,776
Word's gonna get back.

66
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:38,151
It's gonna get back to Jericho
about what you're doing,

67
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,641
and there's nothing you
can do to stop it!

68
00:04:06,508 --> 00:04:08,370
- You okay?
- Yeah.

69
00:04:09,935 --> 00:04:12,610
- Looks like they went easy on you.
- Yeah, for now.

70
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:14,879
They haven't found Hawkins yet.

71
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:19,221
We're gonna get out of here.

72
00:04:25,216 --> 00:04:28,502
How many people have to die
before you don't care anymore?

73
00:04:30,012 --> 00:04:32,030
April's death was not your fault.

74
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:36,645
I can't even be sure Heather's dead
with the lies they're spreading.

75
00:04:38,744 --> 00:04:39,808
I've seen, Jake.

76
00:04:43,203 --> 00:04:44,783
I don't think I can go back.

77
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,123
Staying here and getting
yourself killed

78
00:04:48,223 --> 00:04:51,056
isn't going to make you
feel any better, trust me.

79
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,858
Remember the time
I was supposed to...

80
00:05:00,687 --> 00:05:03,018
wake you up for that meteor shower?

81
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:08,426
Yeah, it was supposed
to be this...

82
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:11,305
once-in-a-lifetime thing.

83
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,605
Anyway...

84
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:15,451
you were so pissed at me,

85
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:18,385
so I finally gave up
and let you sleep.

86
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:21,091
I'm not giving up this time.

87
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:34,515
I should arrest you right here!

88
00:05:34,624 --> 00:05:37,159
It's not his fault. We had to deal
with him in New Bern.

89
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,661
Gray, what the hell is this?

90
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:39,834
There's no deal!

91
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,377
I'm not giving away anything!

92
00:05:41,492 --> 00:05:44,179
Listen, we'll think of something.
Right now we need to stand down.

93
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,889
No, we're not leaving
without our salt.

94
00:05:46,024 --> 00:05:48,852
- It's not worth people getting hurt.
- She's right.

95
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:51,575
- All right, everybody...
- What are you doing?

96
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:53,557
Dale, I'm not going to
let people get killed.

97
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:55,604
- This was your idea.
- This is over!

98
00:05:55,704 --> 00:05:56,804
Get your guys out of here!

99
00:05:57,007 --> 00:05:58,885
Hey! Gray, come on!

104
00:06:17,205 --> 00:06:18,415
How many more are there?

105
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:20,168
I'm not sure.
Six, maybe seven.

106
00:06:20,268 --> 00:06:22,231
We need gurneys.
What happened?

107
00:06:22,274 --> 00:06:23,605
Some guys from New Bern showed up

108
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:25,605
trying to steal our salt.
There was a shootout.

109
00:06:25,643 --> 00:06:27,735
Oh, my God!
Okay, Harry...

110
00:06:27,844 --> 00:06:30,066
Harry, we're gonna get you
cleaned up, buddy, okay?

111
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:32,229
All right, you need me
to look at your arm?

112
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:33,841
No, it's okay. I can wait.

113
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,828
We shouldn't be patching
those guys up.

114
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,998
We should be arresting them.
They opened fire on us!

115
00:06:39,034 --> 00:06:40,652
We don't know who shot first, all right?

116
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:41,844
I'll get to an investigation.

117
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:44,296
Right now we need to make
sure people don't die.

118
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:46,353
Oh, my God.

119
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,841
Get him to Kenchy... now.

120
00:06:53,463 --> 00:06:55,629
Could we get some ice, please?
She twisted her ankle.

121
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:56,695
I'm fine.

122
00:06:57,609 --> 00:06:58,641
Hang on.

123
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:04,045
Hold on, Harry.

124
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,096
Hey, Mrs. Carmichael.
Is he gonna be all right?

125
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:09,499
No, he's not gonna be all right!

126
00:07:09,656 --> 00:07:10,818
I didn't want this to happen.

127
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:12,565
Why should we expect
anything different?

128
00:07:12,636 --> 00:07:16,591
As long as you and your boyfriend are
all set, the rest of us can go to hell!

129
00:07:17,123 --> 00:07:19,220
Wouldn't your father be proud?

130
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,472
What is that supposed to mean?

131
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,600
Okay, come on.
She's just nervous.

132
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,719
Caroline, take a look at
her ankle, will ya?

133
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:27,036
Don't worry about it.

134
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:28,902
Gail, we heard about the shooting.

135
00:07:29,002 --> 00:07:30,887
I brought the antiseptic
I've been working on.

136
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:31,958
What can we do to help?

137
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,101
Look, I need charts on
everybody who's checked in.

138
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,130
Annie, show her how to
fill one out, will ya?

139
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,417
- What's all this gonna mean for Eric?
- I don't know.

140
00:07:38,428 --> 00:07:40,018
But haven't we heard anything?

141
00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:41,429
I told you I don't know.

142
00:07:41,746 --> 00:07:43,284
Johnston's working on it.

143
00:07:43,384 --> 00:07:46,812
Now what I could use is a roll
of gauze and some bandages.

144
00:07:46,912 --> 00:07:48,911
They're on the cart
next to the ultrasound.

145
00:07:48,943 --> 00:07:50,563
I just don't know
what that looks like.

146
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,454
Never mind. I'll do it myself.

147
00:07:54,911 --> 00:07:56,804
What the hell did you think
was gonna happen?!

148
00:07:56,805 --> 00:07:58,543
You didn't have to bring
rangers in there.

149
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,094
I was protec...
What?!

150
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:04,882
I'm afraid we've had
our first fatality.

151
00:08:06,294 --> 00:08:08,285
One of your guys
from New Bern...

152
00:08:08,385 --> 00:08:10,440
Dawson.
I didn't get the first name.

153
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:13,467
Jim Dawson.

154
00:08:16,061 --> 00:08:18,107
You have got to let me
go back to New Bern

155
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,532
and tell them that you support
this salt mine deal.

156
00:08:20,604 --> 00:08:21,609
No, that's not happening.

157
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,944
If they so much as think that
you fired the first shot...

158
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:25,754
- The who fi... What?
- Come on, Gray.

159
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:28,268
We need to work together
while we still can.

160
00:08:32,141 --> 00:08:33,627
Things are bad in New Bern.

161
00:08:34,315 --> 00:08:36,584
And when they find out
that six of us came here

162
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,602
and only five are coming back...

163
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:41,469
What are you saying, Russell?

164
00:08:43,128 --> 00:08:44,301
You got people there.

165
00:08:46,538 --> 00:08:47,978
You should bring 'em home.

166
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,379
Eric's still there.

167
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:59,113
Johnston, you need
to know something.

168
00:08:59,817 --> 00:09:01,773
vEric hasn't been seen
for a few days.

169
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:05,214
And yesterday, Jake went
back there to try and find him.

170
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:06,725
You're telling me this now?

171
00:09:07,956 --> 00:09:10,522
All right, come on. We leave now,
we can get there before dawn.

172
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:12,672
- No, no, no. I'm not authori...
- Did you hear him?

173
00:09:12,673 --> 00:09:14,900
Constantino wants a bigger fight.

174
00:09:15,197 --> 00:09:17,778
He's not gonna have
my sons as human shields.

175
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:21,381
Let's go!

176
00:09:47,868 --> 00:09:49,057
Maggie?

177
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,741
Of all the jail cells, right?

178
00:09:59,997 --> 00:10:02,453
Hardly recognize you
without your wardrobe.

179
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:05,989
What happened?
You guys get caught?

180
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,035
Kind of hard to pull that
voff without the tank.

181
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:13,655
We...

182
00:10:14,172 --> 00:10:16,503
pretty much split up after Jericho.

183
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,559
I came to New Bern with
a couple of the guys,

184
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:23,567
but we got turned away at the border
a few weeks ago.

185
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,032
I was dumb enough to try
and sneak back in.

186
00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:28,738
Why? This place is hell.

187
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,180
- It's worse out there.
- Really? That's hard to imagine.

188
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:37,637
I heard you two got dragged
in front of the Town Hall.

189
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,856
I don't want to scare you, Jake,
but you gotta get out of here.

190
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,151
It isn't exactly easy.

191
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,654
You could do it if you
got someone outside.

192
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:47,142
Why?
Do you?

193
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:49,583
Know someone outside?
No.

194
00:10:51,461 --> 00:10:53,307
I'm just trying to help.

195
00:10:54,457 --> 00:10:55,588
Last time you tried to help,

196
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,805
you nearly wiped out
my town's supplies.

197
00:10:58,026 --> 00:11:00,294
- I was trying to survive.
- Yeah, so were we.

198
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:02,328
Look, I'm not saying it was right.

199
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:06,509
We had something people
wanted and we used it.

200
00:11:06,744 --> 00:11:07,980
That's how it works.

201
00:11:09,732 --> 00:11:12,142
You think you're helpless in here?
You're not.

202
00:11:12,168 --> 00:11:13,615
Not if you have something they want.

203
00:11:13,636 --> 00:11:15,616
What makes you think
I have something they want?

204
00:11:15,636 --> 00:11:18,568
I don't think they're beating
the two of you up for fun.

205
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:21,129
Even if I did have something,
I wouldn't give it to them.

206
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:22,712
You're right. You shouldn't.

207
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:25,195
But I could.

208
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,637
Yeah, right.
No, thanks.

209
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:30,841
Listen, if you talk... they're going
to throw you back in your cell.

210
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,770
There's no way they're letting
either of you out of here.

211
00:11:35,926 --> 00:11:39,446
But if I had the information,
I could trade it for my freedom.

212
00:11:39,853 --> 00:11:40,866
And I can go get help.

213
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,982
What... give myself up
to get you out?

214
00:11:43,091 --> 00:11:45,109
So I can get all three of us out.

215
00:11:45,943 --> 00:11:47,977
And you can take me
back to Jericho.

216
00:11:50,512 --> 00:11:52,326
I can't go anywhere without you.

217
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:03,072
Let's go.

218
00:12:03,713 --> 00:12:05,087
What are you doing?
Get up!

219
00:12:05,187 --> 00:12:06,826
Hey, where are you taking him?

220
00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:09,365
He's already told you
everything he knows!

221
00:12:16,215 --> 00:12:17,560
How are things here?

222
00:12:17,795 --> 00:12:19,328
Harry's going to be okay, but...

223
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:21,140
I'm worried about the staff.

224
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,661
Everybody's exhausted.

225
00:12:24,695 --> 00:12:26,232
You sure you're okay to drive?

226
00:12:26,332 --> 00:12:27,698
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

227
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,231
Better hit the road.

228
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:37,175
Be careful.

229
00:12:39,932 --> 00:12:43,327
If I lose all three of you...
I swear to God...

230
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:49,006
I'm going to bring them home.

231
00:12:51,314 --> 00:12:52,706
You get some sleep.

232
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,103
Got to go.

233
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:21,935
What's going on?

234
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:24,969
What are you doing to him?

235
00:13:46,244 --> 00:13:49,248
Jake, just give me a chance, please.
We can end this.

236
00:14:04,063 --> 00:14:06,144
His name is Robert Hawkins.

237
00:14:08,678 --> 00:14:10,840
He said he's probably in a hunting cabin

238
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,575
owned by a guy named Ted Lewis.

239
00:14:12,675 --> 00:14:13,791
He works at the factory.

240
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,279
Find out where it is.

241
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:17,483
Get over there.

242
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:20,824
You're supposed to
take me with you.

243
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:21,934
What?

244
00:14:22,372 --> 00:14:24,719
That's... the deal I made
with Constantino.

245
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,726
I go with you, and as soon as
you see the guy's there,

246
00:14:26,826 --> 00:14:28,662
you drop me off at the checkpoint.

247
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:31,165
Just talk to Constantino.

248
00:14:31,501 --> 00:14:33,629
This is... he was supposed
to be here!

249
00:14:34,826 --> 00:14:36,046
Take her with you.

250
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:38,424
If he's not there, kill her.

251
00:15:05,188 --> 00:15:06,827
This is Johnston Green
from Jericho.

252
00:15:06,976 --> 00:15:09,244
- We need talk to the sheriff.
- He's up at the cabin.

253
00:15:09,332 --> 00:15:11,187
We have orders
he's not to be interrupted.

254
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,432
He'll want to be
interrupted for this.

255
00:15:29,332 --> 00:15:31,435
It's not exactly Mayberry, is it?

256
00:15:32,346 --> 00:15:33,554
Not since Ravenwood.

257
00:15:34,598 --> 00:15:36,170
How are you with a rifle?

258
00:15:38,406 --> 00:15:40,244
I hunted jackrabbits before.

259
00:15:42,793 --> 00:15:45,625
Well, I've never shot a person,
if that's what you're asking.

260
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:55,839
We need to go back to the factory.

261
00:15:56,353 --> 00:15:57,611
We need mortars.

262
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,448
Well, for what?

263
00:15:59,614 --> 00:16:01,143
We can't launch them
over that fence.

264
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,057
We're not going
to launch them from here.

265
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,750
Phil.

266
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:25,174
Nice spread you got here.

267
00:16:25,522 --> 00:16:27,344
I always wanted you
to see this place.

268
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,574
Well, I just...

269
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:30,528
wish it were under
better circumstances.

270
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:34,866
I just found out Eric's been
missing a couple of days.

271
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:37,797
I'd like a little update on that.

272
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:40,379
And there was an incident
at the salt mine.

273
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:42,615
Some of our people got hurt.

274
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:45,991
Let's take a walk.

275
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,553
<i>I'll go around back.</i>

276
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:02,009
<i>I got the front.
You watch her.</i>

277
00:17:02,407 --> 00:17:03,417
<i>Let's go.</i>

278
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,425
You better hope he's home.

279
00:17:16,506 --> 00:17:19,205
This mine deal,
this is your idea?

280
00:17:19,403 --> 00:17:21,804
I thought it could help the town,
create a partnership.

281
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:24,330
- That didn't quite work out, did it?
- It was...

282
00:17:24,446 --> 00:17:26,499
mishandled all the way around.

283
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,689
We were hoping we could
reach some agreement.

284
00:17:28,728 --> 00:17:30,908
It's a little late for that.
You opened fire on our citizens.

285
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:32,415
- We don't know who shot first.
- Come on, Phil.

286
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:34,717
A bunch of guys shows up with guns
in the middle of the night

287
00:17:34,718 --> 00:17:36,587
trying to take our salt.
What would you have done?

288
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,882
Jericho's continuous acts of
aggression against this town

289
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:40,696
are unjustifiable.
- What "continuous acts"?

290
00:17:40,715 --> 00:17:42,088
We're neighbors, for God's sake.

291
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:43,363
I didn't hear much talk of neighbors

292
00:17:43,364 --> 00:17:45,333
when you sent Ravenwood
straight to our door.

293
00:17:45,506 --> 00:17:47,757
We almost blew everything
to hell and gone

294
00:17:47,758 --> 00:17:50,224
trying to defend ourselves
against those mercenaries.

295
00:17:50,422 --> 00:17:52,475
We had no idea where
they were headed next.

296
00:17:52,476 --> 00:17:53,782
You couldn't try and warn us?

297
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,680
You couldn't help us when they were
raiding what little we had left,

298
00:17:56,681 --> 00:17:58,275
shooting whoever got in their way?

299
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,809
My deputies, my friends?

300
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,712
Then I find both of your sons.

301
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:05,990
Both of them in my factory

302
00:18:06,028 --> 00:18:08,439
trying to destroy the last form
of capital this town's got.

303
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,458
Slow down.

304
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:13,625
Jake was apprehended yesterday,
attempting to sabotage my factory.

305
00:18:16,315 --> 00:18:17,574
That makes no sense.

306
00:18:17,575 --> 00:18:19,499
The factory's producing wind turbines.

307
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,536
Your sons are pretty
bent on the idea.

308
00:18:21,884 --> 00:18:24,235
I caught Eric the day before
trying to do the same thing.

309
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,780
We're holding both of them.

310
00:18:35,257 --> 00:18:36,879
Now, you listen to me.

311
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,008
I don't care what you think
we've done to you,

312
00:18:40,637 --> 00:18:42,739
but if any harm comes
to either of those boys,

313
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,345
this is not going to end well.

314
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:46,779
There's been little chance
of this ending well for some time.

315
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,035
I want to see my boys. Now.

316
00:19:05,806 --> 00:19:07,726
What the hell's
taking them so long?

317
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,334
Who are you?

318
00:19:45,822 --> 00:19:47,577
- Don't shoot!
- Who are you?

319
00:19:47,676 --> 00:19:49,299
I'm with Jake.
I'm with Jake.

320
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,580
- Columbus! Columbus!
- What you say?

321
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:54,296
Jake said if I said Columbus
you'd know he sent me. I was...

322
00:19:54,297 --> 00:19:55,422
I was with him in prison.

323
00:19:55,423 --> 00:19:57,713
He sent me to help you.
He sent me to help you!

324
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:58,888
Columbus, Columbus.

325
00:20:00,693 --> 00:20:01,719
I got it.

326
00:20:05,411 --> 00:20:06,454
How is Jake doing?

327
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:09,285
He's okay.

328
00:20:10,312 --> 00:20:11,339
Yeah?

329
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:23,417
That's Ted.

330
00:20:23,781 --> 00:20:25,006
He's with me.

331
00:20:27,076 --> 00:20:29,212
I'm Maggie.
Jake sent me.

332
00:20:29,377 --> 00:20:30,404
Where are the cops?

333
00:20:32,706 --> 00:20:34,030
They've been dealt with.

334
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:38,715
You don't want to go in there.

335
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,798
Here, this is everything.

336
00:20:49,857 --> 00:20:51,165
So, what's the plan?

337
00:20:52,788 --> 00:20:53,947
Plan?

338
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,126
There's going to be
an explosion in town.

339
00:20:57,532 --> 00:20:59,072
Hopefully, it'll cause enough chaos

340
00:20:59,073 --> 00:21:01,505
that we can somehow
get Jake and Eric out of there.

341
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,393
I think I can help you do that.

342
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,720
I have an in with Constantino.

343
00:21:30,974 --> 00:21:32,812
Come on. Get up.

344
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,410
What the hell happened?

345
00:21:39,188 --> 00:21:40,628
I didn't tell them anything.

346
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:43,856
But I already gave them Hawkins.

347
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:46,058
It's not about Hawkins.

348
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:50,097
They want to know about Jericho.

349
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:53,134
What our defenses are like.

350
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,180
Do we have any troops?

351
00:21:57,587 --> 00:21:59,094
Where are they posted?

352
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,462
Do we have a stockpile of weapons?

353
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,504
We have to get back.

354
00:22:08,514 --> 00:22:09,723
We have to warn them.

355
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,465
We will.

356
00:22:17,189 --> 00:22:18,878
We're not going to die in here.

357
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:36,731
Hey. I'm taking off.

358
00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:40,133
Thanks for all your help.

359
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:41,534
Yeah. No problem.

360
00:22:41,938 --> 00:22:43,486
You need to get some rest.

361
00:22:43,685 --> 00:22:44,694
I will.

362
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:48,042
Listen.

363
00:22:48,248 --> 00:22:50,300
I am sorry if I was abrupt earlier.

364
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:53,198
We're all under a lot of pressure.

365
00:22:59,622 --> 00:23:01,194
Mary's really trying.

366
00:23:01,358 --> 00:23:03,786
Maybe... maybe
you could give her a chance.

367
00:23:04,654 --> 00:23:05,874
Yeah, I know.

368
00:23:07,921 --> 00:23:09,727
It's... it's just being here.

369
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,176
This was April's whole world.

370
00:23:15,445 --> 00:23:17,005
I miss her so much.

371
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,998
I know. It's not fair.

372
00:23:27,922 --> 00:23:29,294
For what it's worth,

373
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,743
you and Mary have a lot in common.

374
00:23:35,763 --> 00:23:37,754
What? We both love Eric?

375
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:41,730
No. I was actually going to say

376
00:23:42,563 --> 00:23:44,745
you're both pretty tough broads.

377
00:23:47,281 --> 00:23:49,545
You're both... a little hardheaded.

378
00:23:50,378 --> 00:23:51,516
In a bar fight...

379
00:23:52,712 --> 00:23:53,874
even money.

380
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:15,458
- Everything okay back here?
- Fine.

381
00:24:17,763 --> 00:24:20,096
Thought you were supposed
to stay off your ankle.

382
00:24:20,284 --> 00:24:22,343
Whatever. It's not like I got shot.

383
00:24:23,035 --> 00:24:24,736
I told you, Skylar. It wasn't our fault.

384
00:24:24,876 --> 00:24:26,214
I know. I just

385
00:24:27,193 --> 00:24:28,718
don't understand why now it's okay

386
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:32,823
for all this random criticism about
my dad to come flying out at me.

387
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:36,612
What is that?

388
00:24:37,216 --> 00:24:39,855
Especially coming from people
who were supposedly his friends.

389
00:24:40,338 --> 00:24:41,639
I guess they're not his friends.

390
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:43,491
The Carmichaels used
to come over, like,

391
00:24:43,637 --> 00:24:45,256
every other week for dinner.

392
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,033
We used to go on vacations together.

393
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,956
Why would they do
that if they hated him?

394
00:24:49,132 --> 00:24:51,158
They don't hate him.
They're just scared of him.

395
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:55,873
My dad was a good person.

396
00:24:56,548 --> 00:24:59,703
He gave them the money
for the clock on Main Street.

397
00:25:01,638 --> 00:25:04,027
He... he did lots of good things.

398
00:25:05,259 --> 00:25:06,362
Maybe he did,

399
00:25:06,585 --> 00:25:08,866
but that's not why
they were nice to him.

400
00:25:09,088 --> 00:25:11,892
They were nice to him because
he had a lot of power.

401
00:25:12,642 --> 00:25:14,085
That's how it works.

402
00:25:27,804 --> 00:25:29,297
We made it to the factory.

403
00:25:29,434 --> 00:25:30,473
You both ready?

404
00:25:30,573 --> 00:25:33,109
We're going to need someone to cover
those guards over there.

405
00:25:33,209 --> 00:25:34,832
Ted, be ready to take them out.

406
00:25:37,811 --> 00:25:38,949
I thought I was driving.

407
00:25:39,054 --> 00:25:41,754
Someone's got to be on those guards
while I get Jake and Eric out.

408
00:25:41,854 --> 00:25:43,297
Cover them until I get back,

409
00:25:44,018 --> 00:25:45,285
and if need be,

410
00:25:45,724 --> 00:25:47,413
take out the sniper first.

411
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,899
5 months ago,
you know what I was doing?

412
00:25:53,322 --> 00:25:54,776
Customizing my truck.

413
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,231
I was getting ready to defend
my dissertation.

414
00:25:59,674 --> 00:26:00,812
Russian lit.

415
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:06,275
How about you? What were you doing
last time things were normal?

416
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:10,837
I can't remember back that far.

417
00:26:11,295 --> 00:26:12,685
Is everybody ready?

418
00:26:13,487 --> 00:26:15,898
How will we know when
you're finished over there?

419
00:26:16,965 --> 00:26:17,998
You'll know.

420
00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:33,236
I'll wait here.

421
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:37,223
Russell, these are not your sons.
You can go on home.

422
00:26:38,948 --> 00:26:40,150
We can fix this.

423
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:42,267
It doesn't have to end this way.

424
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:45,883
I get the feeling
it's just getting started.

425
00:26:47,496 --> 00:26:50,445
You can come to Jericho if
you want to. You know that.

426
00:26:51,572 --> 00:26:53,014
I've got family here,

427
00:26:53,648 --> 00:26:54,797
a little girl.

428
00:26:55,976 --> 00:26:57,278
This is our home.

429
00:26:58,357 --> 00:27:01,501
And I keep thinking if I stay here,
maybe we can stop this.

430
00:27:10,117 --> 00:27:13,155
You get in a bad situation, go to
the railroad tracks and go east.

431
00:27:13,378 --> 00:27:16,680
It'll take you to Route 70 and
you can skip the checkpoint.

432
00:27:18,698 --> 00:27:19,988
Thank you, Russell.

433
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:21,284
Good luck.

434
00:27:24,987 --> 00:27:26,794
We're going to have
to do this another time.

435
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:29,457
- What?
- My deputy says it isn't a good day.

436
00:27:29,726 --> 00:27:31,322
You can come back tomorrow.

437
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:34,348
I'm not leaving until
I see my sons, Phil.

438
00:27:34,732 --> 00:27:36,081
I'll tell you what.

439
00:27:36,561 --> 00:27:38,645
You bring back all of my citizens

440
00:27:38,751 --> 00:27:40,276
who were shot in Jericho last night

441
00:27:40,393 --> 00:27:42,892
and I'll give you 15 minutes
with your sons.

442
00:27:43,807 --> 00:27:45,484
You don't want to do this.

443
00:27:47,689 --> 00:27:49,108
Let's go, Mr. Green.

444
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:51,630
What's this?

445
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:55,576
We're going to escort you
back to the checkpoint.

446
00:27:57,315 --> 00:27:59,567
Get in the car, please, Mr. Green.

447
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:56,758
Mortars are good to go.

448
00:29:20,988 --> 00:29:22,000
Get up.

449
00:29:45,973 --> 00:29:47,412
Don't shoot me!
Don't shoot!

450
00:29:48,446 --> 00:29:50,944
I'm the one they sent to get
the guy from Jericho!

451
00:29:51,093 --> 00:29:52,137
He tried to kill me.

452
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:55,410
Please, I need to talk to Constantino
right away, please.

453
00:30:07,152 --> 00:30:09,486
<i>Constantino, I'm just telling you
what he told me.

454
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,890
<i>He's going right now to the factory
to blow it up, and

455
00:30:11,972 --> 00:30:13,680
<i>then he's gonna... he's gonna
blow up the town hall

456
00:30:13,702 --> 00:30:15,902
<i>so that he can get Jake and Eric out.
- You expect me to believe

457
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:19,664
he wired a government building
under 24-hour armed surveillance?

458
00:30:24,592 --> 00:30:26,798
I'm just telling you what he told me.

459
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,972
I'm trying to help you,
so you'll let me stay as a citizen.

460
00:30:30,054 --> 00:30:32,544
- Please don't lock me in here!
- Do you think I've forgotten

461
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:34,299
how quickly you turned
on your own friends

462
00:30:34,318 --> 00:30:35,798
when we first brought you in here?

463
00:30:35,887 --> 00:30:38,743
I don't believe a word
that comes out of your mouth.

464
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:57,597
Get him out of here.

465
00:30:57,761 --> 00:30:58,782
What is this?

466
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,374
Come on.
You already know everything.

467
00:31:01,637 --> 00:31:03,103
What do you want from us?

468
00:31:03,256 --> 00:31:05,344
- I already told you everything I know.
- Maybe so,

469
00:31:05,643 --> 00:31:07,626
but maybe your brother'll
be a little more...

470
00:31:07,883 --> 00:31:09,109
more forthcoming

471
00:31:09,308 --> 00:31:11,038
if he thinks it'll save your life.

472
00:31:12,962 --> 00:31:14,100
Let him go!

473
00:31:15,414 --> 00:31:16,563
Let him go!

474
00:31:19,196 --> 00:31:21,542
Move that barricade
and let him through.

475
00:31:56,977 --> 00:31:58,373
- Let him go.
- Tell me.

476
00:31:58,525 --> 00:31:59,698
Let him go!

477
00:32:00,325 --> 00:32:02,307
How many of the roads
out of Jericho are wired?!

478
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,891
- I don't know!
- What you know!

479
00:32:04,032 --> 00:32:05,990
How do you defeat Ravenwood?!
Tell me!

480
00:32:06,448 --> 00:32:08,101
- Tell me right now!
- Eric, look at me!

481
00:32:08,216 --> 00:32:10,824
- Don't tell him anything!
- How many spies have you sent here?!

482
00:32:10,874 --> 00:32:12,718
Tell us what you know
or we slice his throat.

483
00:32:25,969 --> 00:32:27,118
Leave him alone, Perkins!

484
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:29,441
What was that?

485
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:38,660
Come on!

486
00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:12,110
There was an explosion at the factory.

487
00:33:12,136 --> 00:33:14,238
- Move them to the warehouse.
- What about the other prisoners?

488
00:33:14,245 --> 00:33:15,583
Just them, now!

489
00:33:16,304 --> 00:33:17,395
Uncuff them.

490
00:33:17,571 --> 00:33:19,190
Come on. Let's go.
Un-handcuff them!

491
00:33:19,336 --> 00:33:20,345
Let's go!

492
00:33:20,474 --> 00:33:21,729
Come on. Move!

493
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:40,979
Jeez.

494
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:42,491
Where you going?

495
00:33:42,984 --> 00:33:44,719
To get the... to get the truck.

496
00:33:44,767 --> 00:33:46,536
You were told to wait here
till I got back.

497
00:33:46,584 --> 00:33:47,588
I know.

498
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:49,954
Breathe.

499
00:33:50,177 --> 00:33:51,268
Just breathe.

500
00:33:51,936 --> 00:33:53,848
Everything's going fine.

501
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,042
I can't do this.

502
00:33:56,757 --> 00:33:58,822
I'm sorry, no.
I can't.

503
00:33:59,147 --> 00:34:00,183
I'm sorry.

504
00:34:42,396 --> 00:34:43,416
Get up!

505
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,362
- You okay?
- I'm good.

506
00:35:06,506 --> 00:35:07,573
Jake, look out!

507
00:35:20,464 --> 00:35:21,543
Over here!

508
00:35:26,073 --> 00:35:27,175
Everybody go!

509
00:35:27,785 --> 00:35:28,794
Go! Get up!

510
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:37,220
Come on!

511
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,910
<i>New Arrivals. Potatoes meat
inquire inside for trade.

512
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:10,878
Thanks, Wayne.
Uh, with the rest in aisle 4.

513
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,552
Can I help you, Mrs. Carmichael?

514
00:36:27,162 --> 00:36:28,945
I heard you've got some meat.

515
00:36:29,274 --> 00:36:31,315
One of Mr. Henderson's
mares broke her leg,

516
00:36:31,444 --> 00:36:32,875
but she was healthy.

517
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:36,692
I'll take a quarter pound.

518
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:38,651
This is a pound of grain.

519
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:42,111
That's not gonna be enough.

520
00:36:43,606 --> 00:36:45,677
But that's what it says.
It says 4 pounds of grain

521
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:47,187
for a pound of meat.

522
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:48,799
The price went up.

523
00:36:49,316 --> 00:36:50,348
Sorry.

524
00:36:53,146 --> 00:36:54,155
Please.

525
00:36:55,184 --> 00:36:58,175
It's for Harry.
The doctor said he needs protein.

526
00:37:00,376 --> 00:37:01,632
It's up to you.

527
00:37:15,084 --> 00:37:17,676
My father was a good man,
Mrs. Carmichael.

528
00:37:20,503 --> 00:37:21,606
Yes, he was.

529
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,541
There's a quarter pound.

530
00:37:28,007 --> 00:37:29,051
Thank you.

531
00:37:42,011 --> 00:37:43,149
We're closed!

532
00:37:45,354 --> 00:37:47,137
I just wanted to return this.

533
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:49,535
- The antiseptic really helped.
- Thank you.

534
00:37:50,996 --> 00:37:52,474
I have a fresh batch.

535
00:37:52,996 --> 00:37:54,122
We'll take it.

536
00:37:57,432 --> 00:38:00,669
So there's no one in town who
wants to have a drink tonight?

537
00:38:02,124 --> 00:38:04,411
You'd think the big draw
would be the atmosphere

538
00:38:04,564 --> 00:38:06,757
and the gracious hospitality,
but turns out,

539
00:38:06,933 --> 00:38:08,106
it's the booze.

540
00:38:08,915 --> 00:38:10,886
They'll be back when
I make more vodka.

541
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:12,381
Thank you.

542
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:15,714
How's everything going
down at the center?

543
00:38:16,187 --> 00:38:17,207
Well...

544
00:38:17,427 --> 00:38:18,752
it's calmed down.

545
00:38:19,057 --> 00:38:21,098
We had to break up a lot of fights.

546
00:38:21,584 --> 00:38:24,710
This whole New Bern thing
is making everybody really jumpy.

547
00:38:26,951 --> 00:38:28,130
Talked to Gray.

548
00:38:29,103 --> 00:38:32,447
Said if they're not back by dawn,
then he'd go up there himself.

549
00:38:35,891 --> 00:38:38,085
Then it's gonna be a long night.

550
00:38:42,343 --> 00:38:44,087
You're welcome to stay,

551
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,683
listen to music or...

552
00:38:47,313 --> 00:38:49,389
I think I'll go home and wait there.

553
00:38:52,717 --> 00:38:54,172
If I hear anything...

554
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:56,459
I'll let you know.

555
00:38:57,996 --> 00:38:59,028
Same here.

556
00:38:59,767 --> 00:39:00,999
Night, Mary.

557
00:39:15,646 --> 00:39:18,966
I didn't think we'd make it this far
with the gas in that tank.

558
00:39:38,034 --> 00:39:40,896
We, uh, we got about 12 miles
to cover, and,

559
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:44,263
I don't think she's gonna make it.

560
00:39:45,272 --> 00:39:46,668
We have to try.

561
00:39:47,313 --> 00:39:49,859
She didn't leave us.
We're not leaving her.

562
00:39:58,572 --> 00:39:59,686
Here's your knife.

563
00:40:00,706 --> 00:40:02,600
- How's your shoulder?
- Yeah.

564
00:40:03,515 --> 00:40:04,817
Hurts like hell.

565
00:40:06,025 --> 00:40:07,116
It's good.

566
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:12,602
How you holding up?

567
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,112
I'm still walking.

568
00:40:15,558 --> 00:40:16,649
Yes, you are.

569
00:40:19,898 --> 00:40:21,294
This is real whiskey.

570
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:28,425
This is actual whiskey.

571
00:40:29,645 --> 00:40:32,448
- I kept a stash just for emergencies.
- I bet you did.

572
00:40:42,402 --> 00:40:43,552
What do you think?

573
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,828
It's no meteor shower, but...

574
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:54,891
Thanks for coming to get me.

575
00:40:58,175 --> 00:40:59,184
Smell that?

576
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:02,277
First wheat's going in.

577
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:05,198
Used to be my favorite time of year.

578
00:41:11,126 --> 00:41:12,792
Listen to that wind.

579
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,773
Still moving, even
after everything we did.

580
00:41:16,938 --> 00:41:18,873
With everything that's coming.

581
00:41:20,972 --> 00:41:21,981
We should go.

582
00:41:40,604 --> 00:41:53,089
