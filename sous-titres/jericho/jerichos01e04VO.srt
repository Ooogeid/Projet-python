1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,960
Previously on Jericho:

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,870
All right, it looks like the explosion
came from the west

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:06,610
maybe Denver.

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,330
Are we under attack?

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,380
This could've been a test.

6
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,670
Could've been an accident.

7
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,820
Look, I know you're telling
people it was an accident

8
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,050
but if it was an attack, Sheriff

9
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,860
and there's chaos out there,

10
00:00:15,905 --> 00:00:17,363
you might not want the wrong people knowing

11
00:00:17,362 --> 00:00:18,631
that Jericho is still here.

12
00:00:18,638 --> 00:00:22,668
Dale Turner's mother died tonight
in another explosion

13
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,680
--Atlanta.
--Oh, my God.

14
00:00:26,768 --> 00:00:30,720
--Won't the rain clear the radiation out of the air?
--Yes, and bring it straight down on Jericho.

15
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:32,522
A direct, concentrated hit.

16
00:00:32,525 --> 00:00:34,123
Anyone exposed too long...

17
00:00:34,555 --> 00:00:36,470
How do you know about radiation, Mr. Hawkins?

18
00:00:38,237 --> 00:00:38,810
Stanley.

19
00:00:38,925 --> 00:00:40,371
No, hey! No, uh-uh.

20
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:41,610
Stanley, don't touch her.

21
00:00:43,096 --> 00:00:45,313
How do you know the rain's radioactive?

22
00:00:45,327 --> 00:00:46,542
Denver's pretty far away.

23
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:48,503
Well, we don't know
how many bombs there were.

24
00:00:52,777 --> 00:00:53,303
Oh, my God.

25
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:54,351
We got something!

26
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:56,170
Are they just reporting it
or are they behind it?

27
00:00:56,178 --> 00:00:57,470
Maybe we're being invaded.

28
00:00:57,477 --> 00:00:58,541
If this country is at war,

29
00:00:58,547 --> 00:00:59,631
we need to know it.

30
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:01,143
More than electricity or food,

31
00:01:01,147 --> 00:01:02,313
this town needs information.

32
00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:04,532
--We can't just sit here in the dark.
--He's right.

33
00:01:04,728 --> 00:01:06,040
Makes us too vulnerable.

34
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,620
We could organize a group of people

35
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,062
send them out in every direction

36
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:11,913
--The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
--Let's hope not.

37
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:41,303
I'm telling you, it's the Midwest.

38
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:43,530
From the skyline, I'm thinking Cincinnati.

39
00:01:43,907 --> 00:01:46,010
I wish we could read the license plates.

40
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:50,482
Let's make Cincinnati a question mark.

41
00:02:09,235 --> 00:02:11,303
--Jake.
--Hey, Stanley. Hey, Bonnie.

42
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:14,213
--Anything new?
--No, not since yesterday.

43
00:02:14,888 --> 00:02:16,730
Shep and Gray should have been back by now.

44
00:02:17,858 --> 00:02:20,870
Our radios went silent about 50 miles out.

45
00:02:23,658 --> 00:02:27,061
God, it makes you wonder
what happened to whoever shot this.

46
00:02:28,758 --> 00:02:31,260
I think that might have been
the last thing they ever saw.

47
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:52,193
The generator's running out of gas.

48
00:02:52,196 --> 00:02:53,703
We're going to lose the TV.

49
00:02:54,635 --> 00:02:55,851
I'll take care of it.

50
00:02:56,946 --> 00:02:57,870
How can you?

51
00:02:58,026 --> 00:02:59,792
Gas pumps don't work at the station

52
00:02:59,977 --> 00:03:00,993
with the power down.

53
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:02,763
Look, I don't want you to worry.

54
00:03:10,015 --> 00:03:10,951
Sorry, folks.

55
00:03:11,195 --> 00:03:12,602
We're closing early tonight.

56
00:03:12,698 --> 00:03:13,370
Take a flashlight,

57
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:14,211
it's dark out there.

58
00:03:14,215 --> 00:03:15,581
What? It's only 9:30.

59
00:03:15,585 --> 00:03:16,333
You heard her,

60
00:03:16,335 --> 00:03:17,280
let's move it, folks.

61
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:18,311
Time to go home.

62
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:19,522
Let's move it out.

63
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:31,530
--Hey.
--Hey.

64
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:34,632
--Is the generator out?
--No, out of booze.

65
00:03:36,078 --> 00:03:38,870
--Any more images?
--No, just the same loop.

66
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,511
Come on, I'll walk you home.

67
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:42,193
Where do you live?

68
00:03:42,897 --> 00:03:43,812
That way.

69
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:49,572
So is it weird being home after so long?

70
00:03:50,116 --> 00:03:51,090
A little bit.

71
00:03:51,485 --> 00:03:54,702
I still can't get used to Bailey's
without the mechanical bull.

72
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:57,562
Stanley must have cried
when they took that out.

73
00:03:57,565 --> 00:03:58,891
He had the record.

74
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:03,210
When did the Pizza Garden
become the Cyberjolt Cafe?

75
00:04:03,217 --> 00:04:05,952
Oh, when the Health Department
shut down the Pizza Garden.

76
00:04:06,095 --> 00:04:06,661
What?!

77
00:04:06,717 --> 00:04:11,921
--Oh, don't tell me you liked the Pizza Garden.
--I used to work there washing dishes.

78
00:04:12,036 --> 00:04:14,192
Oh, you must not have done a very good job.

79
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,740
That came from the alley.

80
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:34,962
It's the pharmacy.

81
00:04:42,955 --> 00:04:44,291
Why don't you go get some help?

82
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,411
Help...

83
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:14,613
H... Help.

84
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:28,811
Jake.

85
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,010
Who is he?

86
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:37,772
I don't know. Help me get him out of here.

87
00:05:37,965 --> 00:05:39,590
Not without gloves or a hazmat suit.

88
00:05:39,598 --> 00:05:41,461
We got to get him to a doctor, now.

89
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:47,222
Is that radiation sickness?

90
00:05:47,465 --> 00:05:48,373
I think it might be.

91
00:05:52,646 --> 00:05:56,032
--Heather, Heather.
Get her out.
--Okay. Let's go.

92
00:05:56,195 --> 00:05:58,002
Come on, Bill, let's go.

93
00:05:58,596 --> 00:06:01,142
--Help us pick him up.
--I'm not touching him.
No way. Not me.

94
00:06:01,147 --> 00:06:02,821
He could be contagious.

95
00:06:02,825 --> 00:06:04,171
He's not contagious, Bill.

96
00:06:04,608 --> 00:06:05,792
I'm sorry, Stanley.

97
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:08,263
What if it was me lying here, Bill?
Would you walk away then?

98
00:06:09,856 --> 00:06:11,742
We could get sick touching that guy.

99
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:14,603
It's not like with you, Stanley.

100
00:06:14,746 --> 00:06:16,672
We don't even know who this guy is.

101
00:06:16,926 --> 00:06:19,713
I just stopped by Bailey's
to check on the TV signal.

102
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:23,292
--Can't you cut your husband some slack?
--And that took three hours?

103
00:06:24,868 --> 00:06:29,133
--I was only there for, like, an hour.
--We're in a state of emergency, Eric.

104
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:31,260
I'm aware of that, April.

105
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:34,081
Dr. Peterson's gone to Kansas City
to look for his daughter.

106
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:36,523
--And Dr. Hoder's worked the last 24 hours.
--Well, I am here now.

107
00:06:36,526 --> 00:06:39,531
--What do you want from me?
--And you... decided to go have a beer.

108
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,741
I've got a baby on a ventilator

109
00:06:42,748 --> 00:06:44,630
and the generator is almost out of gas.

110
00:06:44,747 --> 00:06:46,653
Well, don't you have a hand pump?

111
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:49,700
Who'd pump it?

112
00:06:49,705 --> 00:06:50,121
Out of the way.

113
00:06:50,315 --> 00:06:51,290
Out of the way.

114
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:52,863
Out of the way!

115
00:06:53,276 --> 00:06:56,180
--April, he's having trouble breathing.
--Get him in Room Three.

116
00:07:22,136 --> 00:07:23,092
Who is that?

117
00:07:23,955 --> 00:07:25,091
Who's in there?

118
00:07:27,587 --> 00:07:28,660
Hello?

119
00:07:32,856 --> 00:07:34,122
Who is that?

120
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:40,712
--It's just me, Mrs. Leigh.
--Oh, Dale.

121
00:07:40,715 --> 00:07:41,651
What are you up to?

122
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:44,803
--You scared me to death.
--It was supposed to be a surprise.

123
00:07:44,845 --> 00:07:45,853
What?

124
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:49,883
Oh...

125
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:56,470
Where did you get all this?

126
00:07:56,755 --> 00:07:58,123
The train that never showed up.

127
00:07:58,127 --> 00:07:59,083
It smashed into a car.

128
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:00,651
There's a ton of food just sitting on it.

129
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:02,923
It's just about five miles outside of town.

130
00:08:03,846 --> 00:08:06,320
Well, we can't just take it, it's not ours.

131
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:08,340
Not all of it, anyway.

132
00:08:08,576 --> 00:08:09,900
The town took your food.

133
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:12,772
Well, it was an emergency.

134
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:14,612
And so is this.

135
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:17,491
The hell with them.

136
00:08:25,847 --> 00:08:27,030
Who is this man?

137
00:08:27,226 --> 00:08:28,640
Anyone recognize him?

138
00:08:29,238 --> 00:08:30,571
Not so far.

139
00:08:31,866 --> 00:08:33,391
Those burns...

140
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:37,703
--Does that mean that he was close to the blast?
--Why'd he come to Jericho?

141
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:41,111
--It's a hell of a way from Denver.
--Maybe he's related to someone in town.

142
00:08:41,347 --> 00:08:43,301
Then why'd he break into the pharmacy?

143
00:08:44,747 --> 00:08:47,231
--Any I.D.?
--No, just some keys.

144
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:48,601
He doesn't even have a wallet.

145
00:08:53,488 --> 00:08:56,228
--Is he going to be okay?
--Depends on the dose that he got.

146
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:02,330
Son, you and Stanley should go wash up.

147
00:09:02,336 --> 00:09:05,262
--Those clothes might still be contaminated.
--There's a shower down the hall.

148
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:21,680
Dad.

149
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:23,290
We got another situation.

150
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:25,830
There's not much more gas
in the generator here.

151
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:27,992
Bailey's tavern went dark tonight.

152
00:09:28,187 --> 00:09:30,851
That was the only satellite dish
in town getting a signal

153
00:09:31,175 --> 00:09:33,251
our only link to the outside world.

154
00:09:34,817 --> 00:09:36,381
--You okay?
--Yeah.

155
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:39,660
We're going to have to get people to siphon
gas out of their cars.

156
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,171
What if more come?

157
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:44,040
There's not enough gas to keep the clinics
going for all of them.

158
00:09:44,236 --> 00:09:48,322
--You saying we ought to turn them away?
--No, I'm saying we have limited resources.

159
00:09:48,717 --> 00:09:51,491
Well, for right now, let's just get
as much as we can.

160
00:09:51,976 --> 00:09:53,480
Some of the nurses are spooked.

161
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:55,120
They're worried about contamination.

162
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:57,740
Honey, I'll do anything I can to help you.

163
00:09:59,576 --> 00:10:01,972
If you could, keep an eye on this baby

164
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:05,280
then I could see to the other patients.

165
00:10:05,786 --> 00:10:06,800
Sure.

166
00:10:07,335 --> 00:10:09,140
I hope to God the power doesn't go.

167
00:10:09,338 --> 00:10:11,591
Look, we'll do everything we can

168
00:10:11,598 --> 00:10:12,961
until we can't.

169
00:10:42,696 --> 00:10:44,021
Dad, it's Sam.

170
00:10:47,846 --> 00:10:50,731
Dad, I'm thirsty, are you in there?

171
00:10:52,186 --> 00:10:54,261
--Any word from Shep or Gray?
--No, Mayor.

172
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:56,023
Still can't get 'em on the radio.

173
00:10:56,028 --> 00:10:58,781
Maybe they got captured by
those tanks Stanley saw.

174
00:10:59,888 --> 00:11:02,640
Those tanks are probably just National Guard

175
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:03,922
--okay? So--
--You don't know that.

176
00:11:04,557 --> 00:11:06,213
--They could be--
--Shh.

177
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:10,282
They could be China,

178
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:11,393
they could be Iran.

179
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:13,221
Al Qaeda, North Korea--

180
00:11:13,426 --> 00:11:14,713
anybody who hates us.

181
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,502
They could be coming here and what's
our line of defense?

182
00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:21,490
You're looking at it.

183
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:28,930
Jake?

184
00:11:32,396 --> 00:11:33,212
Oh.

185
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:34,672
Had to take a shower.

186
00:11:35,386 --> 00:11:39,042
--Go ahead.
--No, I I did; I just took a shower.

187
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:41,540
Oh, right.

188
00:11:42,056 --> 00:11:43,220
So what's up?

189
00:11:44,777 --> 00:11:45,661
I...

190
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:48,883
April said that the medical
center was running low

191
00:11:48,885 --> 00:11:50,333
on gasoline for the generator

192
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:52,781
and it occurred to me that
if we had a length of hose

193
00:11:52,788 --> 00:11:55,372
and a funnel, we could siphon
gas out of our cars.

194
00:11:55,557 --> 00:11:59,252
Then it occurred to me there's all that gas
in the tanks at Murthy's gas station

195
00:11:59,676 --> 00:12:03,042
and if we could get enough suction we could
get all the gas we wanted...

196
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:04,803
Would a water pump do it?

197
00:12:17,315 --> 00:12:18,103
Bonnie.

198
00:12:20,785 --> 00:12:22,511
This could be my brother.

199
00:12:23,215 --> 00:12:26,503
--Is this how they die?
--No. Stanley didn't get it this bad.

200
00:12:26,507 --> 00:12:29,670
--He could still got cancer.
--No, we don't know that.

201
00:12:30,877 --> 00:12:31,542
Listen.

202
00:12:32,097 --> 00:12:33,382
Don't worry about me,

203
00:12:33,388 --> 00:12:34,272
I'll be fine.

204
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:39,862
Take care of him.

205
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:49,771
I'm going to have to put him on a ventilator

206
00:12:49,777 --> 00:12:50,871
it'll use up power but--

207
00:12:51,097 --> 00:12:53,013
But the baby has the better chance for survival

208
00:12:53,017 --> 00:12:55,723
--save the generator for the baby.
--Hey, hey, hey, what about him?

209
00:12:56,705 --> 00:12:57,920
Give him something for the pain.

210
00:12:57,925 --> 00:13:00,170
--Keep him comfortable.
--Sit back and watch him die.

211
00:13:00,175 --> 00:13:01,111
Well, I don't like it, Jake,

212
00:13:01,118 --> 00:13:03,221
but that's the most rational
option we have right now.

213
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:05,061
Unless you can think of something better.

214
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:11,183
--Will your generator last until morning?
--I think so.

215
00:13:11,226 --> 00:13:12,642
All right, give me until then.

216
00:13:21,297 --> 00:13:22,702
Can you tell me your name?

217
00:13:25,156 --> 00:13:26,173
Victor.

218
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:28,821
Miller.

219
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:30,132
Victor.

220
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:32,783
Victor, you're in a medical clinic.

221
00:13:33,048 --> 00:13:36,220
--Okay, we're going to take care of you.
--No, no.

222
00:13:37,737 --> 00:13:39,111
They're coming.

223
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:44,280
They're coming.

224
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,623
So how long do you think he'll be unconscious?

225
00:14:06,518 --> 00:14:07,731
Could be a long time.

226
00:14:08,366 --> 00:14:09,973
If he ever wakes up again.

227
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:11,481
Who are "they"?

228
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:13,053
Who's coming?

229
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:17,411
Well, maybe he saw passengers
from one of those planes.

230
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:18,853
He could've meant terrorists.

231
00:14:19,327 --> 00:14:20,030
Unless he wakes up,

232
00:14:20,037 --> 00:14:21,792
we don't know what kind of danger we're in.

233
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:22,853
For right now,

234
00:14:22,856 --> 00:14:24,463
hire as many deputies as you can

235
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:26,200
use them to help you get gas.

236
00:14:26,206 --> 00:14:27,360
Clinic's running low.

237
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:28,822
But it's not my gas,

238
00:14:28,828 --> 00:14:29,990
it belongs to Noraco.

239
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:31,483
It's no use to anyone, Mr. Murthy.

240
00:14:31,487 --> 00:14:33,513
Without electricity, the pumps don't even work.

241
00:14:33,668 --> 00:14:36,952
--And we'll leave you an I.O.U. for the 500 gallons.
--I could be fired.

242
00:14:36,957 --> 00:14:38,872
With all due respect, who's going to fire you?

243
00:14:39,565 --> 00:14:41,392
It's a different world now, Mr. Murthy.

244
00:14:44,497 --> 00:14:45,411
All right, let's get them open.

245
00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:47,163
Stanley will be here any second.

246
00:14:56,055 --> 00:14:57,581
They're never coming back.

247
00:14:58,137 --> 00:15:00,373
The district manager, any of them.

248
00:15:01,345 --> 00:15:02,212
Are they?

249
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:06,571
No.

250
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,382
Shortly after my mother died,

251
00:15:11,386 --> 00:15:13,481
my husband was transferred to St. Louis.

252
00:15:14,457 --> 00:15:15,751
It was hard to leave Memphis,

253
00:15:15,757 --> 00:15:17,082
because it was our home.

254
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,102
But eventually we learned to love it.

255
00:15:21,305 --> 00:15:22,693
How did your mother die?

256
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:24,101
M.S.

257
00:15:25,998 --> 00:15:26,680
Aly,

258
00:15:26,938 --> 00:15:28,943
what area of St. Louis are we from?

259
00:15:29,368 --> 00:15:31,681
--Kirkwood.
--Which is where?
--Near Powder Valley.

260
00:15:31,688 --> 00:15:33,552
Lots of hiking, trails and nature.

261
00:15:33,777 --> 00:15:34,891
We love to hike.

262
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:39,553
--Sam, where'd you go to school?
--The Crow School.

263
00:15:39,735 --> 00:15:40,941
Crow Island School.

264
00:15:40,948 --> 00:15:42,503
God, we've gone over this so many times.

265
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,183
And we'll go over it again and again

266
00:15:44,186 --> 00:15:45,432
until we get it right.

267
00:15:45,497 --> 00:15:46,351
Mom...

268
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:48,663
You know what, I can't keep doing this.

269
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,730
Keep Samuel inside.

270
00:15:49,735 --> 00:15:50,581
I've got my story.

271
00:15:50,585 --> 00:15:50,970
Hey.

272
00:15:51,206 --> 00:15:52,202
We lived in a two-bedroom house

273
00:15:52,206 --> 00:15:53,211
we drove a green Volvo,

274
00:15:53,215 --> 00:15:54,963
we had a stay-at-home mom, which is bull

275
00:15:55,068 --> 00:15:56,092
because she worked all the time

276
00:15:56,098 --> 00:15:57,990
because our dad was never around.

277
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:03,062
Upstairs. Go on.

278
00:16:10,786 --> 00:16:12,820
--You got a minute?
--Of course.

279
00:16:19,496 --> 00:16:22,780
You probably heard the, uh,
Sheriff's been killed, along with
three more of our men.

280
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:24,191
I heard.

281
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,271
I'm sorry for your loss.

282
00:16:26,638 --> 00:16:27,421
Thank you.

283
00:16:27,935 --> 00:16:29,460
Well, we're down to just me and Bill, and

284
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,050
neither of us is trained for
a national emergency.

285
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,401
I don't think anyone is prepared for this.

286
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:36,161
We need a few more deputies.

287
00:16:36,558 --> 00:16:39,340
--And I thought since you were a cop in
St. Louis and all...
--No.

288
00:16:39,685 --> 00:16:42,400
It's a very flattering offer, but I'm still
settling my family.

289
00:16:42,407 --> 00:16:43,922
It'd just be for the time being.

290
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:49,251
Look, Mr. Hawkins, people are on edge.

291
00:16:49,956 --> 00:16:52,613
All right, we've got break-ins
and kids vandalizing.

292
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:54,513
We just need some more manpower to show people

293
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:56,310
there's still law and order in this town.

294
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:00,992
All right.

295
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,491
When do I start?

296
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,423
You're already on the clock.

297
00:17:09,468 --> 00:17:12,093
We're asking everyone in town to donate
five gallons of gas.

298
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:14,451
Sorry, honey.

299
00:17:14,627 --> 00:17:15,683
I need my car.

300
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:19,170
But, Gracie, if the clinic
goes down, people could die.

301
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:20,522
I sympathize, Eric,

302
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:22,862
but I already gave this town my whole store.

303
00:17:23,057 --> 00:17:25,442
Someone else can donate gas.

304
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:33,930
Bill.

305
00:17:34,237 --> 00:17:35,133
What's up?

306
00:17:35,146 --> 00:17:36,823
I'm going to head to the clinic
with what I've got.

307
00:17:36,828 --> 00:17:38,192
How are things on your end?

308
00:17:38,197 --> 00:17:39,512
It's not looking good.

309
00:17:39,596 --> 00:17:41,673
We're still 90 gallons short at the clinic.

310
00:17:41,855 --> 00:17:42,841
People are scared, Eric.

311
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,073
They're hoarding.

312
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:46,860
Maybe we can't afford to be so polite.

313
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,022
I couldn't find an empty pesticide container.

314
00:17:57,028 --> 00:17:59,642
--I thought this water tank might do.
--No, no, we can't use steel.

315
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:01,111
There's too much risk of static.

316
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:02,851
One spark, the whole thing could blow sky-high.

317
00:18:02,857 --> 00:18:04,841
We don't have time to look for something else.

318
00:18:05,597 --> 00:18:07,830
Well-well, who's going to fill it?

319
00:18:09,406 --> 00:18:11,932
--Well, what do you want to do, draw straws?
--No, I'll do it, you got Bonnie to take care of.

320
00:18:11,938 --> 00:18:12,773
Don't be a martyr.

321
00:18:12,886 --> 00:18:14,131
I've already been irradiated.

322
00:18:14,186 --> 00:18:16,511
--I'm doomed.
--No, you're going to live to be 100, remember?

323
00:18:16,517 --> 00:18:19,501
--Our pacts never work out.
--Let's just do this before we
think about it too much.

324
00:18:19,618 --> 00:18:20,562
Get off the truck, Stanley.

325
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,571
Get off the truck.

326
00:18:22,657 --> 00:18:23,441
Back up.

327
00:18:29,378 --> 00:18:30,123
Hey, Allison.

328
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:31,592
This place has been a zoo all day.

329
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:35,773
--Uh, that's $1.69.
--Okay.

330
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:38,503
--You got the last bag of corn chips.
--I'll give you 20 bucks for them.

331
00:18:40,968 --> 00:18:43,360
--She picked them up first.
--Fine, I'll give you the 20.

332
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:44,523
Or how about this?

333
00:18:44,526 --> 00:18:45,340
I'm having a party.

334
00:18:45,345 --> 00:18:47,650
If you give me the chips, then I'll invite you.

335
00:18:47,897 --> 00:18:49,530
--I don't even know you.
--So?

336
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,560
It's not like there's anything else to do.

337
00:18:56,215 --> 00:18:57,061
You're awesome.

338
00:18:57,127 --> 00:18:59,562
Come by anytime, it's the big house
at the top of the Pines.

339
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:02,613
Okay, well, thanks, I guess.

340
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:06,411
Hi.

341
00:19:58,038 --> 00:19:59,062
Oh, God...

342
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:02,042
The generator's down!

343
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:04,751
Somebody call April. Hurry.

344
00:20:09,495 --> 00:20:10,981
We've lost all his machines.

345
00:20:10,987 --> 00:20:13,441
--He's not breathing.
--Okay, I've got to get to the baby

346
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:15,332
and I only have one hand pump.

347
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:16,682
You used to be a nurse, Gail.

348
00:20:16,686 --> 00:20:17,800
You'll do fine.

349
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:41,593
Let's go.

350
00:20:48,786 --> 00:20:50,002
Keep a steady pace.

351
00:20:57,017 --> 00:20:59,320
Uh, guys, we have a problem.

352
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:00,393
It's stuck.

353
00:21:00,395 --> 00:21:01,873
No, no... Wait, wait, wait,

354
00:21:01,957 --> 00:21:02,170
wait, wait, wait, wait!

355
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:02,932
Don't feel bad.

356
00:21:02,936 --> 00:21:06,243
--I'll loosen it up for you.
--No. The gas has been sloshing around in there

357
00:21:06,247 --> 00:21:07,110
building up fumes.

358
00:21:07,197 --> 00:21:09,391
--If you force the cap, and it sparks...
--What do you want to do, huh?

359
00:21:09,396 --> 00:21:11,310
Look, with all the static electricity built up

360
00:21:11,316 --> 00:21:13,170
we could blow the thing to kingdom come.

361
00:21:21,808 --> 00:21:22,700
That was dumb.

362
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:24,700
All right, here, get that to him.

363
00:21:24,976 --> 00:21:25,841
Let's go!

364
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,850
I can't get a heartbeat.

365
00:21:38,028 --> 00:21:38,733
Let's go!

366
00:21:51,297 --> 00:21:52,473
All right, got it.
Go, Stanley.

367
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:05,551
How's he doing?

368
00:22:07,245 --> 00:22:10,813
--He was down for about two minutes.
--I need help with the cardiac feed.

369
00:22:11,096 --> 00:22:13,013
See that black switch?
Can you turn that on?

370
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:24,550
Oh, right.

371
00:22:24,685 --> 00:22:25,713
I invited you.

372
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:30,212
--Oh, yeah, but, you know I don't...
I don't have to...
--No, forget it. Come in.

373
00:22:35,786 --> 00:22:37,353
Hey, where's April?

374
00:22:43,685 --> 00:22:44,543
Come on.

375
00:22:44,908 --> 00:22:45,762
Come on.

376
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:55,181
April...

377
00:22:56,537 --> 00:22:58,220
I got 75 gallons of gas.

378
00:22:58,616 --> 00:22:59,592
For the generator.

379
00:23:00,538 --> 00:23:01,423
Thanks.

380
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:04,461
We got it covered.

381
00:23:17,405 --> 00:23:20,551
Sky, look who invited himself.

382
00:23:21,897 --> 00:23:24,321
Just put it over there.

383
00:23:34,797 --> 00:23:36,711
Why are you such a jerk when
you're with your friends?

384
00:23:38,047 --> 00:23:40,863
--Did I interrupt a lover's spat?
--Stop it, Lisa.

385
00:23:43,386 --> 00:23:43,972
You know what?

386
00:23:44,177 --> 00:23:45,312
I'm gonna go home.

387
00:23:45,596 --> 00:23:47,560
I only came here 'cause you begged me to.

388
00:23:51,118 --> 00:23:53,620
Just... go home.

389
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,553
Victor!

390
00:24:14,225 --> 00:24:15,573
Victor. It's okay.

391
00:24:17,046 --> 00:24:17,872
April!

392
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:19,250
April!

393
00:24:20,528 --> 00:24:21,221
Vic...

394
00:24:26,017 --> 00:24:26,990
Victor, you said they're coming.

395
00:24:27,108 --> 00:24:28,242
Who's coming?

396
00:24:31,315 --> 00:24:33,160
They need... help.

397
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:33,832
Who does?

398
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:34,931
Who needs help?

399
00:24:34,978 --> 00:24:37,883
20 from... Denver.

400
00:24:37,938 --> 00:24:39,290
Where are they, huh?

401
00:24:39,325 --> 00:24:40,391
Where are they?

402
00:24:42,968 --> 00:24:44,863
Lake... A lake?

403
00:24:46,775 --> 00:24:49,990
--Boat. Boat dock.
--A lake with a boat dock?

404
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:51,173
A lake with a boat dock.

405
00:24:51,175 --> 00:24:52,823
What road is it on, do you remember?

406
00:24:54,817 --> 00:24:55,850
I...

407
00:24:56,637 --> 00:24:59,660
have my... daughter.

408
00:25:00,607 --> 00:25:03,182
--...coming...
--April!

409
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:29,902
Can I help you?

410
00:25:29,908 --> 00:25:31,273
Hey, turn that down.

411
00:25:32,057 --> 00:25:34,620
--Yeah, we had a complaint that
you're using too much power.
--And?

412
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:37,861
--And... the party's over.
--You can't do this.

413
00:25:37,865 --> 00:25:40,593
--This is a private home.
--All right, everybody pack it up.

414
00:25:42,927 --> 00:25:46,023
--How much gas you using to run this place, Skylar?
--None of your business.

415
00:25:46,026 --> 00:25:47,940
It's my generator, it's my gas.

416
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:48,791
Right.

417
00:25:50,778 --> 00:25:51,861
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

418
00:25:55,746 --> 00:25:57,231
Just go home.

419
00:26:00,296 --> 00:26:02,202
Jimmy. Jimmy!

420
00:26:02,797 --> 00:26:03,481
You got to get over here.

421
00:26:03,485 --> 00:26:04,663
We found Shep's truck.

422
00:26:16,685 --> 00:26:17,470
Bill?

423
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:19,630
No sign of Shep,

424
00:26:20,096 --> 00:26:21,661
but look what I found inside.

425
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:25,683
Looks like Victor Miller forgot his wallet.

426
00:26:28,868 --> 00:26:30,750
This is the man you were talking about?

427
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,722
The... The stranger in the hospital?

428
00:26:33,818 --> 00:26:35,290
Yeah. You recognize him?

429
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:37,913
No.

430
00:26:38,715 --> 00:26:41,323
I just think we should ask him what
he did with your friend Shep.

431
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:56,521
April, we need to talk to Victor Miller.

432
00:26:56,677 --> 00:26:58,943
--He's unconscious.
--I think you need to wake him up.

433
00:26:59,516 --> 00:27:00,220
No.

434
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:08,303
Still the same stuff.

435
00:27:10,735 --> 00:27:12,201
Look at all the people running.

436
00:27:13,617 --> 00:27:14,913
What if they come here?

437
00:27:22,045 --> 00:27:22,741
Hey.

438
00:27:23,235 --> 00:27:24,343
You worked a miracle.

439
00:27:24,525 --> 00:27:26,632
Generator's full; we can go three more days.

440
00:27:27,406 --> 00:27:28,660
Great, three days.

441
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:30,781
Hey.

442
00:27:33,217 --> 00:27:34,702
Everything's going to be all right.

443
00:27:38,476 --> 00:27:40,402
You know, when you say it, I almost believe it.

444
00:27:42,168 --> 00:27:43,490
Eric, you there?

445
00:27:47,657 --> 00:27:48,550
Go, Jimmy.

446
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,750
We found Shep's truck.

447
00:27:50,977 --> 00:27:52,033
Meet us at the clinic.

448
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:53,490
I'm on my way.

449
00:27:54,985 --> 00:27:55,611
It doesn't matter.

450
00:27:55,616 --> 00:27:57,253
We have got to go look for his family.

451
00:27:57,448 --> 00:27:59,053
Why'd he have Shep's truck?

452
00:27:59,057 --> 00:28:00,240
We need to know what he did with him.

453
00:28:00,246 --> 00:28:04,073
--I know, but we can't just torture a dying man.
--No one is torturing anyone.

454
00:28:04,075 --> 00:28:06,041
We could give him a shot of adrenaline.

455
00:28:06,065 --> 00:28:08,960
--It'll wake him up enough to question him.
--He's dying of third degree burns.

456
00:28:09,008 --> 00:28:11,100
--It'll be like waking him up on fire.
--Uh...

457
00:28:12,395 --> 00:28:14,321
Our people are dying out there.

458
00:28:14,546 --> 00:28:16,082
Shep may already be dead.

459
00:28:16,318 --> 00:28:19,220
--We need to protect ourselves, Jake.
--We need to protect ourselves from this.

460
00:28:19,225 --> 00:28:22,123
Jake, Shep, he's one of us.

461
00:28:22,348 --> 00:28:26,523
--We need to find out what this guy did to him.
--Hey, he is going to die, anyway.

462
00:28:27,146 --> 00:28:29,020
But he could save some people's lives.

463
00:28:33,718 --> 00:28:34,463
Eric.

464
00:28:42,007 --> 00:28:45,502
--I'd like to do this myself.
--No, I'm not leaving him.

465
00:28:46,837 --> 00:28:47,653
Okay.

466
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,812
What's going on in there?

467
00:28:54,758 --> 00:28:57,953
--They're asking him a few questions.
--Like hell they will. That's my patient.

468
00:28:58,858 --> 00:29:00,860
--Let go of me.
--We need information.

469
00:29:01,486 --> 00:29:02,092
You have no right.

470
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:05,622
--He could be a murderer.
--And that gives you the power
to do anything that you want?

471
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:06,603
Yes.

472
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:10,241
Yes.

473
00:29:17,317 --> 00:29:20,483
Victor, it's going to be okay.
We'll make this quick, all right?

474
00:29:20,868 --> 00:29:21,651
Hey.

475
00:29:24,206 --> 00:29:25,732
The car you drove here--

476
00:29:26,905 --> 00:29:28,433
did someone give it to you?

477
00:29:28,905 --> 00:29:30,201
No, no.

478
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:31,442
It was...

479
00:29:31,796 --> 00:29:33,863
It was... on the side...

480
00:29:33,935 --> 00:29:34,931
of the road.

481
00:29:34,935 --> 00:29:37,973
Okay. It... It was... running.

482
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,600
Okay, okay.

483
00:29:39,926 --> 00:29:43,963
--But was there anybody in it?
--No.

484
00:29:46,155 --> 00:29:48,782
I had... to help them.

485
00:29:50,586 --> 00:29:51,452
Where are they?

486
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:54,182
--Do you remember anything else about the lake?
--It burns.

487
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,311
--Was it off a dirt road?
--It burns.

488
00:29:56,315 --> 00:29:59,573
--He needs morphine.
--Was your daughter at Bass Lake?

489
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:02,843
--Y-Yes.
--He needs morphine, Jake.
--Please, please.

490
00:30:06,256 --> 00:30:07,511
Hey. Hey!

491
00:30:09,156 --> 00:30:13,422
We said families only, hmm?

492
00:30:14,715 --> 00:30:20,241
--Why? Why did you go back to Denver?
--I...

493
00:30:21,348 --> 00:30:25,610
--I couldn't let them die.
--It was a mistake, Vic,

494
00:30:25,845 --> 00:30:29,103
--because now we are a man down.
--No. Some... some...

495
00:30:29,807 --> 00:30:32,740
S-Someone... Someone flipped.

496
00:30:33,055 --> 00:30:34,063
A traitor.

497
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:38,711
There's...a tra... traitor.

498
00:30:41,095 --> 00:30:42,551
Do you know who it was?

499
00:30:48,308 --> 00:30:50,060
Come on, man, tell me.

500
00:30:51,185 --> 00:30:52,981
--Vic, who was it?
--I...

501
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:53,613
Tell me.

502
00:30:53,688 --> 00:30:57,032
Do you know who it was?

503
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,200
You... know.

504
00:31:19,886 --> 00:31:21,613
He's gone.

505
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:41,853
We had to do it.

506
00:31:52,555 --> 00:31:54,792
I thought you were going to a party, hon.

507
00:31:57,815 --> 00:31:59,310
You're worth ten of her.

508
00:31:59,827 --> 00:32:02,691
--Ten of who?
--Skylar Stevens.

509
00:32:04,365 --> 00:32:06,283
--She's not a bad person.
--Hmm.

510
00:32:08,905 --> 00:32:10,201
We're not like them.

511
00:32:11,318 --> 00:32:13,693
They can be nice sometimes, but

512
00:32:13,805 --> 00:32:15,191
don't be fooled.

513
00:32:17,425 --> 00:32:18,803
That's what my mom used to say.

514
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:21,983
Well, she was a smart lady.

515
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:44,800
You scared?

516
00:32:48,497 --> 00:32:50,463
'Cause I remember when I did something wrong

517
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,131
waiting for my old man to come home.

518
00:33:04,737 --> 00:33:06,291
Baby, what you did today--

519
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,080
that wasn't just you going to a party.

520
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,402
It wasn't.

521
00:33:12,405 --> 00:33:13,640
You put your mother,

522
00:33:15,138 --> 00:33:16,001
your brother,

523
00:33:17,935 --> 00:33:19,553
all of us at risk.

524
00:33:20,905 --> 00:33:22,033
Do you hear?

525
00:33:27,167 --> 00:33:29,280
And if you pull something like this again

526
00:33:31,357 --> 00:33:34,921
girl, you have no idea how scared you'll be.

527
00:34:04,557 --> 00:34:06,043
I need a few volunteers.

528
00:34:08,135 --> 00:34:10,362
There's a group of people just outside of town.

529
00:34:10,707 --> 00:34:12,971
No way, man! It's too dangerous out there!

530
00:34:13,198 --> 00:34:14,212
They're at Bass Lake.

531
00:34:15,337 --> 00:34:16,553
They may have radiation sickness.

532
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,381
We need to bring them here
get them to the clinic

533
00:34:18,386 --> 00:34:19,430
before it's too late.

534
00:34:19,846 --> 00:34:21,932
--Turn it back on!
--We've seen it.

535
00:34:22,158 --> 00:34:23,402
We've seen it 100 times.

536
00:34:23,516 --> 00:34:26,413
A man just died in our clinic. Our clinic!

537
00:34:28,248 --> 00:34:30,270
He was traveling with his daughter

538
00:34:31,175 --> 00:34:32,663
and about 20 other people.

539
00:34:34,598 --> 00:34:40,080
All right, it could have been
Shep or Gray or any of us.

540
00:34:42,237 --> 00:34:43,333
They need our help.

541
00:34:44,057 --> 00:34:45,153
Are we going to help them?

542
00:34:46,495 --> 00:34:51,082
Or are we just going to sit here watching
the same three images over and over?

543
00:35:03,196 --> 00:35:04,050
Jake?

544
00:35:05,427 --> 00:35:07,903
I'll donate gas if you need
to fill your car to get them.

545
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:10,763
--Thank you, Mary.
--I'll go with you.

546
00:35:12,596 --> 00:35:13,572
Thank you.

547
00:35:16,128 --> 00:35:17,342
Anybody else?

548
00:35:18,915 --> 00:35:21,463
--I'll go with you, Jake. I'll go.
--Let's go.

549
00:35:21,926 --> 00:35:24,133
--Yeah, me, too.
--Thank you.

550
00:36:09,257 --> 00:36:11,922
Earlier today, we buried 20 people--

551
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,061
refugees from Denver.

552
00:36:14,067 --> 00:36:16,523
People we didn't know,

553
00:36:16,618 --> 00:36:20,641
but were prepared to welcome into our town.

554
00:36:21,566 --> 00:36:24,713
Unfortunately, they died of radiation poisoning

555
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:25,960
before we could reach them.

556
00:36:27,336 --> 00:36:28,942
For those people from Denver,

557
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:30,672
and for our own people,

558
00:36:31,346 --> 00:36:33,661
for Sheriff Dawes and Deputy Riley

559
00:36:35,205 --> 00:36:37,552
for Deputy Conner and Deputy Salem...

560
00:36:41,258 --> 00:36:44,231
...for people out there
somewhere we know nothing about

561
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:47,723
who might be suffering and dying right now--

562
00:36:47,878 --> 00:36:50,301
I ask that we take a moment of silence.

563
00:36:57,066 --> 00:36:58,670
If you've lost a loved one,

564
00:36:58,696 --> 00:36:59,942
would you please stand?

565
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:10,820
If someone you love is missing,

566
00:37:10,825 --> 00:37:12,803
would you join those standing?

567
00:37:24,387 --> 00:37:30,441
We stand because we know
that every life matters.

568
00:37:32,457 --> 00:37:35,553
We have to fight for every life,

569
00:37:36,886 --> 00:37:39,482
even when it seems hopeless,

570
00:37:41,016 --> 00:37:42,630
even when we're afraid,

571
00:37:44,326 --> 00:37:48,750
because the battle ahead
isn't just for our survival

572
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:54,942
it's for our humanity.

573
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:20,043
I think I'm going to be okay.

574
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,921
Jake. Hi.

575
00:38:26,745 --> 00:38:29,721
You're a good man for trying
to help someone you didn't even know.

576
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:30,741
--Hey, you thirsty again?
--No. Couldn't sleep.

577
00:39:38,135 --> 00:39:41,623
--Where did you go to school, Sam?
--Crow Island.

578
00:39:50,647 --> 00:39:53,313
--Who is your dad?
--You.

579
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:58,670
--Who loves you more than anything in the world?
--You.

580
00:40:00,825 --> 00:40:01,963
And, Sam,

581
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:08,122
--who is always going to take care of you?
--Mommy.
