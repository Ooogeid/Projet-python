<i>Previously on</i> Jericho

2
00:00:03,395 --> 00:00:04,834
Oh, my God, Ted.

3
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:08,333
- Jake, this is... Ted Lewis.
- Hey, how you doing?

4
00:00:08,372 --> 00:00:09,863
We grew up together over in New Bern.

5
00:00:09,873 --> 00:00:11,096
This is Russell and Mike.

6
00:00:11,241 --> 00:00:12,273
- Hey.
- Yeah, we met.

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,011
With a dozen full-size windmills,
you could power the whole town.

8
00:00:15,037 --> 00:00:17,509
I'm gonna help turn the lights on
for everyone back home.

9
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:19,770
- You're just going to leave?
- Won't be for very long.

10
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:23,542
Johnston, you SOB.

11
00:00:23,855 --> 00:00:25,485
How the hell did you lose an election?

12
00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:28,149
No, the question is: how did you get
to be in charge in New Bern?

13
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:30,738
- They get tired of you being sheriff?
- No, I'm still sheriff.

14
00:00:30,748 --> 00:00:32,264
Just got a little more authority.

15
00:00:32,274 --> 00:00:34,509
Does this thing work?
Can we get power from it?

16
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:35,604
Probably sometime tomorrow.

17
00:00:35,614 --> 00:00:37,072
Let's get it up as fast as we can.

18
00:00:37,082 --> 00:00:38,571
Can we buy some more of these things?

19
00:00:38,602 --> 00:00:41,244
You got one of the only salt
mines around for 400 miles.

20
00:00:41,264 --> 00:00:43,786
- We're going to need food.
- Won't see another crop till spring.

21
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:45,316
Spring crop is what I'm talking about.

22
00:00:45,332 --> 00:00:47,264
Ten wind turbines for, let's say...

23
00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:48,909
ten percent of your spring crop.

24
00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:50,550
No, we can't put ourselves
in that position.

25
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:52,388
Starve next fall or freeze this winter.

26
00:00:52,436 --> 00:00:54,329
Okay, look,
we'll give you the food.

27
00:00:54,407 --> 00:00:56,675
We can have the wind turbines
to you in a couple weeks.

28
00:00:56,722 --> 00:00:59,116
We're going to need ten Jericho
men to help us build them.

29
00:00:59,147 --> 00:01:01,666
Is this about manpower
for wind turbines?

30
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,772
Or is it more about making sure
you get our crops come spring?

31
00:01:04,788 --> 00:01:06,973
I am not going to build
these things on credit.

32
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,129
You want them now?
You're going to help make them.

33
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:11,132
What you are about to do...

34
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:13,009
means this town's survival.

35
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:14,456
All right, let's move out.

36
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:16,084
If anything happens
to any of them...

37
00:01:16,616 --> 00:01:18,415
you're the first one I come for.

38
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,541
I know.

39
00:01:57,881 --> 00:01:59,210
<i>Hey, Jeff, they're back.

40
00:01:59,758 --> 00:02:02,480
I didn't expect to see
you till spring, Russell.

41
00:02:03,184 --> 00:02:05,297
I thought you might
be needing these.

42
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:07,869
Your windmills.

43
00:02:13,388 --> 00:02:15,500
It's good to see our guys back, but...

44
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:18,981
it's going to take some time for me
to find the guys to replace them.

45
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:20,917
You don't need to replace them.

46
00:02:21,282 --> 00:02:22,318
Well, now, wait...

47
00:02:22,397 --> 00:02:24,601
our agreement was that
we got ten windmills

48
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:25,780
for ten percent of the crops.

49
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:28,850
You'll get your windmills,
but we don't need your men.

50
00:02:29,178 --> 00:02:32,041
Constantino called it
an act of good faith.

51
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:35,324
I didn't think Constantino
knew that term.

52
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,610
But...
I'll take it.

53
00:02:42,408 --> 00:02:43,409
Stanley!

54
00:02:45,779 --> 00:02:47,516
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

55
00:02:48,247 --> 00:02:49,499
Where's Eric?

56
00:02:51,642 --> 00:02:53,082
He didn't come back, Mary.

57
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,463
He said he wasn't ready.

58
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,121
But...

59
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,202
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

60
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:02,623
Okay.
Thanks.

61
00:03:08,684 --> 00:03:11,031
I didn't know you guys
were coming back today.

62
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,035
- None of us did.
- How are you? You okay?

63
00:03:15,122 --> 00:03:16,123
Where's Eric?

64
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,872
Come here.

65
00:03:22,805 --> 00:03:24,400
He didn't come back with us.

66
00:03:25,527 --> 00:03:26,560
Why not?

67
00:03:26,658 --> 00:03:29,590
When I talked to him, he was still
pretty messed up about April's death.

68
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,388
He said he was thinking about
staying in New Bern for a while

69
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:34,797
to get his head together.
- When was this?

70
00:03:35,063 --> 00:03:36,362
Three days ago.

71
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,376
Then, he didn't show up for work,
and I haven't seen him since.

72
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:41,410
I don't know what's
going on in New Bern.

73
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,564
When I asked about Eric,
they couldn't tell me anything.

74
00:03:43,574 --> 00:03:46,557
Then, the cops started escorting
us wherever we went.

75
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,378
Then today, out of nowhere,
Russell says,

76
00:03:48,425 --> 00:03:50,239
"Pack it up, we're going home",
like...

77
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,072
like it wasn't safe for us
there anymore.

78
00:03:58,444 --> 00:03:59,711
Where's my brother?

79
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,762
- I don't know.
- What?

80
00:04:03,357 --> 00:04:05,078
I know he hasn't been
seen for a few days.

81
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:06,517
Did you even try to find him?

82
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:08,348
- I asked Constantino.
- And?

83
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,141
And he told me that
they were looking for him.

84
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:14,067
And then this morning, he told me
to bring the rest of your guys home.

85
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,241
What the hell's going on
over there, Russell?

86
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:19,292
Should I be worried about him?

87
00:04:20,098 --> 00:04:22,163
Answer me.
Should I be worried?

88
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,672
I would be.

89
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:30,365
- I'm going with you.
- No...

90
00:04:30,882 --> 00:04:32,238
you've been gone for weeks.
Go home.

91
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:33,985
You need someone who knows
their way around New Bern.

92
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:35,263
I'll try to find Heather
as soon as I get there.

93
00:04:35,273 --> 00:04:36,723
She knows it better than any of us.

94
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:38,522
Look, it's not safe out there.

95
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:39,852
You can't go by yourself.

96
00:04:40,274 --> 00:04:41,275
I'm not.

97
00:04:45,891 --> 00:04:47,018
I need your help.

102
00:05:02,516 --> 00:05:05,820
You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china, Jake.

103
00:05:05,877 --> 00:05:08,271
I got to try and find him.
I can't just...

104
00:05:09,997 --> 00:05:12,746
There's something going on in that town.
I can feel it.

105
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,737
Stanley starts asking questions,
and they just send them home?

106
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:19,271
Okay, but you understand why
I can't just up and leave, right?

107
00:05:21,584 --> 00:05:23,514
- He's my brother.
- And you said he was upset,

108
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,770
so maybe he just...
- If you're saying no, just say no.

109
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,919
Come on, Jake, I'm not saying no.

110
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:30,778
I'm saying we got to
understand the situation.

111
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:32,264
The situation is...

112
00:05:32,461 --> 00:05:35,214
he's been missing for three days,
and I came to you...

113
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:36,716
for help.

114
00:05:39,884 --> 00:05:40,885
Okay.

115
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:46,976
But if we do this,
we do it my way.

116
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:03,184
Oh, my God.

117
00:06:15,398 --> 00:06:16,603
I'm so glad you're home.

118
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,230
I missed you guys so much.

119
00:06:24,808 --> 00:06:25,919
You're totally back.

120
00:06:27,906 --> 00:06:28,939
<i>Mrs. Green.

121
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:32,443
I'm really sorry to bother
you like this, but...

122
00:06:32,678 --> 00:06:34,115
I thought you should know.

123
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,280
Know what?

124
00:06:35,835 --> 00:06:39,168
The men came back from New Bern,
and Eric wasn't with them.

125
00:06:39,756 --> 00:06:40,758
Why not?

126
00:06:41,415 --> 00:06:43,543
He decided to stay a little longer.

127
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:45,936
Decided to or Constantino insisted?

128
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:49,723
Stanley talked to him.
He said...

129
00:06:50,231 --> 00:06:52,328
he said he wasn't ready
to come home.

130
00:06:57,201 --> 00:06:59,532
- How'd you hurt your hand?
- Oh, I just...

131
00:06:59,563 --> 00:07:01,895
was trying to fix the copper
tubing on my still.

132
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:03,345
It just popped off and cut me.

133
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:05,535
Is alcohol really a priority right now?

134
00:07:06,396 --> 00:07:07,673
Actually, it's not to drink.

135
00:07:07,683 --> 00:07:10,558
I was trying to make antiseptic
for the med center.

136
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:14,054
I should go.

137
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:17,167
- You got any sand over there
at the bar?  - Sand?

138
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,625
Yeah, I think I can show you a way
around that copper tubing.

139
00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:22,706
I'll just give you a hand.

140
00:07:26,715 --> 00:07:27,724
See you in a bit.

141
00:07:33,526 --> 00:07:35,450
Guys... yo, listen.

142
00:07:35,982 --> 00:07:38,610
Stop unloading that.
Put that back.

143
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,184
What the hell is this?

144
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,062
- Salt.  - Who gave you permission
to take it from the mine?

145
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,081
51% of the mine belongs to me.

146
00:07:50,143 --> 00:07:51,677
I just took it from my half.

147
00:07:51,817 --> 00:07:54,868
You don't have a half...
of anything. Your parents do.

148
00:07:55,002 --> 00:07:57,474
Look, I know you still think
of me as a child...

149
00:07:57,505 --> 00:07:59,586
and I can't help it if that's
where you're stuck,

150
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:02,090
but the fact is I have
a right to what I own.

151
00:08:02,183 --> 00:08:04,764
You are a minor and
you don't own anything

152
00:08:04,774 --> 00:08:07,026
as long as your parents
are still alive.

153
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:09,998
Or do you have some information
that I don't have?

154
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:14,652
Look, just... just take
the salt back to the mine

155
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:17,327
and don't make me have to
send my guys to do it.

156
00:08:40,425 --> 00:08:41,693
Proof of residence?

157
00:08:42,295 --> 00:08:43,398
We're not from here.

158
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,623
Sorry, you're going to need
to turn this car around

159
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:47,474
and proceed back
the way you came.

160
00:08:48,699 --> 00:08:50,838
I'm here to see my brother.
His name is Eric Green.

161
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:52,770
You're not hearing me, sir.
No one's allowed...

162
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,628
No, you're not hearing me.
I have to see him.

163
00:08:54,638 --> 00:08:57,164
He came here as part of the deal
you made with Jericho. Now...

164
00:08:57,174 --> 00:08:58,421
Hey, Jake...

165
00:09:02,572 --> 00:09:04,153
I want to talk to Phil Constantino.

166
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:06,061
- Get out of the car.
- Hell, no.

167
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,259
Put your hands on the dashboard.

168
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,552
I want to see your hands.

169
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,213
That's Johnston Green's son.
Let him through.

170
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:20,430
I'll escort him in
to see Sheriff Constantino.

171
00:09:25,718 --> 00:09:27,173
Go ahead, let him through.

172
00:09:44,874 --> 00:09:45,894
<i>Mister, Mister.

173
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,467
Do you have any food?

174
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,034
I'm sorry, I don't...

175
00:09:49,044 --> 00:09:50,455
I'm sorry, I don't have any.

176
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:53,573
All right, ma'am, come on.
Get those kids out of there.

177
00:09:53,652 --> 00:09:54,680
Hey, come on.

178
00:09:54,997 --> 00:09:56,022
<i>Come on, please.

179
00:10:02,453 --> 00:10:04,065
I thought we had it bad.

180
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,525
What the hell happened here?

181
00:10:22,924 --> 00:10:23,931
Ravenwood.

182
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,470
My brother is missing.

183
00:10:27,513 --> 00:10:29,607
I know. I've got patrols
out looking for him.

184
00:10:29,678 --> 00:10:30,946
- And no leads?
- No.

185
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:33,477
Sorry, I wish there's
more I could do.

186
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,842
You're the sheriff and the mayor.
You can do more.

187
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,024
I'm trying, Jake.

188
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,235
You sure Eric even
wants to be found?

189
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:40,560
What's that supposed to mean?

190
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:42,996
We all knew April.
We know what happened.

191
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,360
Last I heard that Eric was
having a tough time.

192
00:10:45,531 --> 00:10:47,226
He'll be fine as soon as
we get him home.

193
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:49,577
You know what?
Let's face the facts.

194
00:10:49,778 --> 00:10:51,060
He might have been attacked.

195
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,827
Could be lying in a
ditch somewhere.

196
00:10:52,955 --> 00:10:55,092
- Why would you say...
- Take it easy!

197
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,742
The fact is some folks around here
aren't too fond of Jericho these days.

198
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:03,080
That's why I sent the workers home
today. When your brother went missing,

199
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,478
I got worried for their safety.

200
00:11:04,603 --> 00:11:05,604
Why?

201
00:11:05,823 --> 00:11:08,984
There's been a lot of rumors
flying around about your town.

202
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:10,533
What are people saying?

203
00:11:10,915 --> 00:11:13,449
They're mad that Jericho didn't
warn us about Ravenwood.

204
00:11:13,543 --> 00:11:16,516
They think you're going to renege
on your part of the food deal.

205
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,331
We've had it rough here, okay?

206
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,974
They're just looking for
somebody to blame.

207
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:22,450
- Where was Eric last seen?
- The factory.

208
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,764
End of his shift.

209
00:11:24,265 --> 00:11:26,048
Look, we're just trying to help.

210
00:11:26,612 --> 00:11:29,264
What is it that you want
that we're not giving?

211
00:11:30,562 --> 00:11:32,502
I want to talk to Heather Lisinski.

212
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:36,821
<i>Take care of each other, Kansas.

213
00:11:39,696 --> 00:11:41,385
Anything new from Mr. Hewitt?

214
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:45,782
No, it's just the same bulletin about
the riots in Chicago Camp West.

215
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:47,808
Hey, thanks for taking on a shift.

216
00:11:48,027 --> 00:11:50,968
Jimmy, it's the least I can do
to make myself useful.

217
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,949
I feel like such a freeloader
sitting around your house all day.

218
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,981
You kidding me?

219
00:11:55,435 --> 00:11:57,437
You're like the best houseguest ever.

220
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:01,040
You cook, you do the dishes, you
never get bored playing Boggle.

221
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:04,341
And we're dreading the day you
and your husband work things out.

222
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:08,411
That sounded a lot less
insensitive in my head.

223
00:12:08,442 --> 00:12:10,852
- I'm sorry.
- No, I understand, thank you.

224
00:12:12,922 --> 00:12:13,923
Listen...

225
00:12:14,408 --> 00:12:16,098
can I talk you about something?

226
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:17,944
Yeah, what is it?

227
00:12:18,664 --> 00:12:20,479
Last night Sam and Woody were

228
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:21,918
drawing pictures.

229
00:12:24,263 --> 00:12:25,593
That's one of Sam's.

230
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,804
I didn't want to bring it up at
the house with everyone around,

231
00:12:32,173 --> 00:12:33,941
I thought it might be upsetting.

232
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,117
No, I'm glad you showed
this to me.

233
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:38,916
I'm not a psychiatrist,

234
00:12:40,258 --> 00:12:43,966
but that really looks like a kid
dealing with some kind of trauma.

235
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,128
I'm-I'm not surprised.
I mean....

236
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:50,431
30 million people died a few months ago.

237
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:53,103
I'll bet there's kids all over the
country still trying to process that.

238
00:12:53,113 --> 00:12:55,547
Maybe, but it's so specific.

239
00:12:56,768 --> 00:12:58,598
The bodies, the house.

240
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:02,515
He's coming by after school.
I'll talk to him then.

241
00:13:03,046 --> 00:13:05,096
- Thank you.
- Sure.

242
00:13:12,348 --> 00:13:15,336
Sand keeps the copper from buckling.

243
00:13:17,026 --> 00:13:18,168
How'd you learn this?

244
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:20,144
Well...

245
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,853
like... most things that
are fun and illegal...

246
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:26,480
from my dad.

247
00:13:27,478 --> 00:13:29,668
So the stories Eric tells are true.

248
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:31,123
Afraid so.

249
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:37,310
You remember that book...

250
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,459
something about...
women are from Venus,

251
00:13:40,516 --> 00:13:42,310
and men are wrong.

252
00:13:43,507 --> 00:13:46,057
Not that I read the book, mind you,
but I did,  you know...

253
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:48,275
flip through Gail's copy of it.

254
00:13:49,685 --> 00:13:52,250
Lot of stuff in there about
men needing to...

255
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:55,911
go off and hold up in
a cave sometime.

256
00:13:58,432 --> 00:14:01,694
Now, I don't know if this was
actually in the book, but...

257
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:05,127
if men can't find a cave,
they'll make one.

258
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,279
Out of...

259
00:14:06,538 --> 00:14:09,667
whatever circumstances happen
to be lying around.

260
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:13,148
Yeah, you're probably right.

261
00:14:13,557 --> 00:14:15,012
I'm sure that's all it is.

262
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:20,707
This isn't your fault, Mary.

263
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:23,570
It wasn't anybody's fault.

264
00:14:25,253 --> 00:14:27,365
I think Eric's figuring that out.

265
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,383
This place is the only reason New Bern
made it through the Depression.

266
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,066
The factory whistle's like
a heartbeat to this town.

267
00:14:38,832 --> 00:14:41,226
Put the wind turbines binds
together just down here.

268
00:14:41,398 --> 00:14:42,399
Sheriff!

269
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:45,630
Who's that?

270
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,977
It's a friend of Heather's.
We met him at Black Jack.

271
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:49,179
Good news.

272
00:14:49,774 --> 00:14:52,136
- This guy knows where your brother is.
- Really? Where?

273
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,231
Eric went home.

274
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:56,329
He and Heather both.
They... left this morning.

275
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:59,036
- Home? To Jericho?
- Why would they do that?

276
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,199
Why didn't they go
with the convoy?

277
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,062
Well, Heather had to talk
him into going. So...

278
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:05,908
by then, the other guys had left.

279
00:15:05,924 --> 00:15:07,927
So, I lent them my car
and my rifle.

280
00:15:08,036 --> 00:15:09,820
They didn't seem worried at all.

281
00:15:09,995 --> 00:15:11,763
Probably back in Jericho by now.

282
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:14,360
Right.

283
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,958
- Hope they're okay.
- Thank you.

284
00:15:18,036 --> 00:15:20,133
- We got to clear the building.
- All right.

285
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,190
What happened?

286
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,045
We had to retrofit all the
machines after the EMP,

287
00:15:24,154 --> 00:15:26,986
and one of them overheated.
Caught part of the building on fire.

288
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:28,410
You got what you need?

289
00:15:29,255 --> 00:15:30,756
Yeah, mystery solved, I guess.

290
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:32,028
Good. Glad to hear it.

291
00:15:32,106 --> 00:15:34,046
If there's nothing else, Deputy Perkins
will escort you out of town.

292
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,080
No. We don't need
to be escorted.

293
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:37,691
It's policy.

294
00:15:37,863 --> 00:15:39,037
You're big on policy.

295
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,037
We almost lost everything when
Ravenwood came through here.

296
00:15:43,147 --> 00:15:45,431
I'm big on anything that
keeps us alive.

297
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:50,395
- Thanks.
- No problem.

298
00:15:56,636 --> 00:15:57,638
Move the truck.

299
00:15:57,982 --> 00:15:59,108
Let them through.

300
00:15:59,312 --> 00:16:01,533
- You buying any of that story?
- Nope.

301
00:16:03,098 --> 00:16:04,699
Neither was Ted.

302
00:16:05,872 --> 00:16:08,172
Slipped me this when
he shook my hand.

303
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:11,770
- It's an address and...
- "Come Alone"

304
00:16:14,922 --> 00:16:16,330
So, we done here?

305
00:16:23,575 --> 00:16:24,952
<i>Back it up.

306
00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:29,536
<i>Let them through.

307
00:16:38,244 --> 00:16:39,746
How long have I been gone?

308
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:41,304
No, before you answer that,

309
00:16:41,444 --> 00:16:43,854
how long has he been here?
- It's very recent really.

310
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:45,590
He hasn't been here that long.

311
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:48,202
I asked you to do one
thing for me, Mimi.

312
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:49,485
One thing!

313
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,768
You know, you listen
to me, Stanley.

314
00:16:52,862 --> 00:16:54,817
Your sister is not a child anymore.

315
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,461
You can't just throw this fit
and kick Sean's ass

316
00:16:57,477 --> 00:16:58,854
and think that's going
to be the end of it

317
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:00,542
I hope you're going to
explain why I can't.

318
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:01,741
Because if you do,

319
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,651
she's just going to latch
on that much tighter.

320
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:06,388
Unless they really get angry,

321
00:17:06,434 --> 00:17:08,933
in which case, the age-old teenage
remedy is to run away,

322
00:17:08,943 --> 00:17:10,904
which used to mean that they'd
hear from them in a couple of days

323
00:17:10,914 --> 00:17:12,216
when they ran out of bus money.

324
00:17:12,514 --> 00:17:14,235
Nowadays, chances are much better

325
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,488
that you'll find their bodies
on the side of a road.

326
00:17:18,724 --> 00:17:19,726
Look...

327
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,791
right now it is under our roof.

328
00:17:22,338 --> 00:17:24,232
And it's a pain in the ass, I know,

329
00:17:24,497 --> 00:17:26,907
but it's a safe and manageable
pain in the ass,

330
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:28,690
and I suggest you let it stay here

331
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,198
before it turns into anything
more than that.

332
00:18:07,493 --> 00:18:08,870
That's Perkins' truck.

333
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:11,546
What's he doing staking
out Ted's trailer?

334
00:18:12,422 --> 00:18:13,439
Let's ask him.

335
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:26,606
Hand your gun to my friend,
and let's pay Ted a little visit.

336
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:28,105
Come on.

337
00:18:37,452 --> 00:18:38,636
Where's my brother?

338
00:18:38,646 --> 00:18:39,861
I don't know, ask him.

339
00:18:40,238 --> 00:18:42,742
He threatened to throw me in jail this
morning if I didn't feed you that lie.

340
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:44,895
- So you haven't seen Eric?
- No. Not for days.

341
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:47,148
- What about Heather?
- She left for work this morning.

342
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:48,961
Next thing I know, they tell
me she's gone missing, too.

343
00:18:48,976 --> 00:18:50,947
Two people disappear,
nobody knows anything?

344
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:52,399
Oh, somebody does.

345
00:18:54,323 --> 00:18:55,325
Right?

346
00:18:58,673 --> 00:18:59,690
Where is he?

347
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:02,318
Screw you.

348
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,291
Hey, come on, Jake,
we got to be smarter than that.

349
00:19:05,338 --> 00:19:06,543
We need answers.

350
00:19:09,578 --> 00:19:12,128
Getting answers...
is easy.

351
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:14,975
It's getting the truth...

352
00:19:15,773 --> 00:19:16,837
that takes work.

353
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,900
When did you last see Eric Green?

354
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Look...

355
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,900
this is not my thing.

356
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,600
I didn't ask you that, did I?

357
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,700
Why do you act like
we did something wrong?

358
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,100
We were attacked.

359
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,700
How do you figure that?

360
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,400
The those machines didn't overheat

361
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,800
this morning at the factory.

362
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,200
It was his brother...

363
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
and that girl.

364
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,900
They sabotaged it.

365
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,900
They would never do that?
We need that factory

366
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,300
just as much as you do.

367
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,600
- I saw them.
- If you saw them, then where are they?

368
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,500
They ran away.

369
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,400
Hold his knees, please.

370
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,300
Look,

371
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,400
why would I be staking out

372
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,100
a trailer park if we had them? Huh?

373
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,600
Constantino put us on alert.
He gave a SOS.

374
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,400
- SOS?
- Shoot on sight.

375
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,000
Look at me.

376
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
What is in that factory?

377
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
I don't know.

378
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,100
No, I'm a cop. I'm a cop.
Ask Constantino.

379
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,500
Ask Constantino.

380
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,800
He knows?

381
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,600
Look at me.

382
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,500
- We go to the factory.
- But Eric...

383
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,900
I don't know about Eric.

384
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,200
But we cannot search this whole town.

385
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,400
So we should go and see what it was
that he was risking his life for.

386
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,700
All right.

387
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,700
You got some place safe you can go?

388
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,100
Yeah, my grandfather has
an old hunting cabin.

389
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,800
You take what's important because
you are not coming back here.

390
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,300
Get up.

391
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,300
On your knees.

392
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,500
What is he doing?

393
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,400
- Down on your knees.
- What?

394
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,000
What are you doing?

395
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,100
Hawkins!

396
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,100
Is that doing it your way?

397
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,100
You asked me to come along.

398
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,000
- What were you going to do?
- You want the truth?

399
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,000
Less than you would have.

400
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,600
You see, I've done...

401
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,000
I've done enough, Jake,
to know better.

402
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,700
It's the fear of torture
that gets results.

403
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,600
Actual torture only works
in the movies.

404
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,100
And this one guy, he was
so skinny, you could

405
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,200
count his ribs through his shirt.

406
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,500
I tried to give him food when I could,
but none of us had much so...

407
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,900
And then one day, I could just...

408
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,600
see it in his eyes.
He'd, uh...

409
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,100
he'd given up.

410
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,900
I never thought I'd be so
thankful to live on a farm.

411
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,600
From now on, I promise
I'll only complain intermittently.

412
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,000
Well, we don't have much, but, uh...

413
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,400
we'll always have enough, so...

414
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,800
Dude, all they need to do
is get the Internet back up.

415
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,200
After that, it's a piece of cake.

416
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,900
Why is that?

417
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,700
Well, you could do anything.

418
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,700
I mean, you could run for president.
Make a virtual White House.

419
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,400
Fly a plane into that.

420
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,000
I mean, virtual cities and towns...

421
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,300
nothing to nuke.
- Yeah, but...

422
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,100
where would we get...

423
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
stuff?

424
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,900
What stuff?

425
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I don't know.

426
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,500
Food, clothes, blankets, fuel.

427
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,300
Not a problem.

428
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,500
After the Internet is back up,
you just order all that stuff.

429
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,300
You know, Stanley,
you would not believe

430
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,200
how helpful Sean has been
around here with the livestock,

431
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,700
and the house,
and... just everything.

432
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,100
It's true.

433
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Yeah, it's weird, Stanley, 'cause

434
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,700
I am much more of a vibe guy.

435
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,200
What the hell is a vibe guy?

436
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,000
You know...

437
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,000
I mean, I've never been into, like,

438
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,400
physical labor.

439
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,400
I'm more the guy that people
have around for my vibe.

440
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,200
My house, my rules, my vibe.

441
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,600
And you sleep there.

442
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,700
So anyhow, it's, like, 3:00 a. m.,
I've got this flashlight in my face.

443
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,600
Gail's over on her side of
the bed trying to find the phone

444
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,800
to call the cops and finally,
I located the light switch.

445
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,100
It's Eric,

446
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,700
who's standing there and he says,

447
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,200
"I can't go to sleep until
I confess I'm drunk. "

448
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,800
I said, "You're what?"

449
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,300
He said, "I'm drunk."

450
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,100
"It won't ever happen again.
I don't know what I was thinking."

451
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,600
Well, meantime,
he looks perfectly normal,

452
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,500
his speech isn't slurred or anything.

453
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,200
Gail starts grilling him. Turns out
he has had a beer and a half.

454
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,900
I said to him,
"Son, do you have any idea

455
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,700
how much beer it takes to get drunk?"

456
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,500
He said, "No, I don't. "

457
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,700
I said, "Well, get out of here and

458
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,300
don't wake me up again until you do."

459
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,000
He left, Gail and
I just could not stop laughing.

460
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
She doesn't laugh too much anymore.

461
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Here I am rambling on. We probably ought
to go take a look at that still.

462
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,000
Good idea.

463
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Hey, buddy.

464
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,800
Your mom just ran to the little
girls' room. Why don't you grab a seat?

465
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,600
Could you give us a minute?

466
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,300
Sure.

467
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,700
Say, you know what?

468
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,900
Why don't we go sit in my office,
maybe we can talk.

469
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,100
About what?

470
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,200
About your artwork.

471
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,100
This is Russell.

472
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,200
He saved our butts out
at the Black Jack.

473
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,000
Hi. It's nice to meet you. I'm Skylar.

474
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,300
Stevens, right?

475
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,800
Something we can help you with?

476
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,300
Well, I was thinking
we could help each other.

477
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,900
You've got a salt mine
with no real distributor.

478
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,600
I've got men, trucks, guns,

479
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,000
but no supplies.

480
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,400
- If we become partners...
- Partners?

481
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,600
I'm asking for half
your share of the mine.

482
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,400
We're doing okay now.

483
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,000
Okay, but the people in Jericho,
they only need so much salt.

484
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,000
I've been out there.

485
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,600
I know the trade routes,
where to find the highest bidders

486
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,500
and how to make it
back here in one piece.

487
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,200
What's in it for us?

488
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,700
Bigger profits.

489
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,600
Where I'm going, I can get you
five times what you can make here.

490
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And...

491
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,000
I'll deal with Gray Anderson for you.

492
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,100
When do you need an answer?

493
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,800
Before I leave in the morning.

494
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,300
Believe me,

495
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,400
this is good for everyone.

496
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,400
It's a full inventory of Jericho.

497
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,300
It's our mine.

498
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,600
And our town.

499
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,400
They sliced it up like they own it.

500
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,700
What do they know that we don't?

501
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Come on.

502
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,400
Hey, sweetie.
What's going on?

503
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,600
We were talking about my drawings.

504
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,500
Look, do you mind waiting
in the lobby a minute?

505
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,300
I just need to talk to
Mr. Taylor alone. Okay?

506
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,700
What are you doing?

507
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,500
Darcy, something going on,
and it's not just about the bombs.

508
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,900
My son has enough to deal with,
you know, without

509
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,700
being poked and prodded.

510
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,500
If there's a problem with him,
I'll take care of it myself.

511
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,700
Right.

512
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,000
Thank you.

513
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,800
For what?

514
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,600
Letting Sean stay.

515
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,500
You're welcome.

516
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,800
And for not calling him an idiot
even when he is done.

517
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,700
Okay, if you know that...

518
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,700
Sorry. Just a little frog
in my throat.

519
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,400
Don't let me interrupt your nice

520
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,400
sibling-bonding moment.

521
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,300
That's what it is, right?

522
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,300
Sean can be an idiot,

523
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,400
but he can also be really great.

524
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,700
All guys are like that,

525
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,600
you have to put up with the
"idiot" stuff...

526
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,600
to get to the "great" stuff.

527
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,200
Yeah? And where did you come
by that litlle pearl of wisdom?

528
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,000
What did she say about me?

529
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,100
When did he learn how to sign?

530
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,800
He's sleeping with a deaf girl.

531
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,300
That's my sister.

532
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,400
I guess if Sean Henthorn is
my biggest problem, then

533
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,200
I'm a pretty lucky guy.

534
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,300
Want to get luckier?

535
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,900
What are you doing?

536
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
It's binding.

537
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,100
The lawyer said it makes me
an emancipated minor.

538
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,200
By declaring your parents dead?

539
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,400
This is wrong

540
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,594
in every way that
something can be wrong.

541
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,758
- Let's just forget about this.
- You can't do that.

542
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,900
- It's legal.
- So,

543
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,098
what, are you gonna pedal your little
bike to Topeka and file this, Dale?

544
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,000
Forget that I'm the mayor.

545
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,300
Okay, I'm speaking to you as
your parents' friend.

546
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,800
My parents would want me to have
my share of the salt mine

547
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,600
Your parents are coming back.

548
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,100
And if it turns out that
that is not true,

549
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,300
then I will help you learn the business.

550
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,000
And who decides when that happens?

551
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,200
You?

552
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,600
I mean my decision, are you saying
laws don't apply any more?

553
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,100
You didn't make a decision.
You signed a piece of paper.

554
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,100
Do you really want your parents
to be dead that badly?

555
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,800
- Okay, stop it.
- No.

556
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,000
You're advising her, Dale.

557
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,100
Did you also tell her
how her parents died?

558
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,500
Because New York survived,

559
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,965
so I guess you probably had
to get pretty creative, right?

560
00:34:09,004 --> 00:34:10,300
Were they killed there?

561
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,100
Or were they murdered
on their way back

562
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,600
to the child who meant
everything to them?

563
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,200
It's just a piece of paper.

564
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,600
Come on.

565
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,700
They're making mortar rounds.

566
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,800
They're running a munitions factory.

567
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,900
Hurry up.
Constantino wants those tonight.

568
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,200
We'll have them ready.

569
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,900
They're getting ready for war.

570
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,100
We need to get back to town.

571
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,300
No, we need to try and stop them.
Cover me.

572
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,800
Hey, there he goes.
Down there.

573
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,800
Hold it!

574
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,000
Hand it over.

575
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,400
Sorry. I guess I'm late for dinner.

576
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,000
Or lunch.

577
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,800
Take your pick.

578
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,100
I was helping Mary.
It took longer than I expected.

579
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,200
You told Eric we'd take care of her.

580
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,200
What I meant was that
we'd help keep her alive.

581
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,700
What I didn't mean was that
we'd run over there

582
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,800
and spend the entire day
every time she needed

583
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,200
somebody to do
a little heavy lifting.

584
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,300
Wait.

585
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,100
You don't think
I'm the reason Eric left?

586
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,800
Do you?

587
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,400
Is that what you think?

588
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,200
I think Eric left for
a lot of reasons...

589
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,900
...but Mary may be why he comes back.

590
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,500
I don't want to have to come back
to this house again.

591
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
Did you get all the toys you want?

592
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,100
So,

593
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,000
what did you and Mr. Taylor
talk about today?

594
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,300
Nothing.

595
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,500
Now, Sam, you know we don't keep
secrets in this family.

596
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,800
Yeah, I know, baby.

597
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,800
What's he doing here?

598
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,600
I think we should talk.

599
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,300
Hey, Sam, honey,
why don't you go upstairs

600
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,700
to your room and
get that last box, okay?

601
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,000
Hey, buddy.

602
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,700
Look, I-I understand, you know,
you being curious about my family.

603
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,100
We haven't made a lot of friends here.

604
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,600
We just kind of keep to ourselves, but

605
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,200
if you want to ask any questions,
just talk to me, okay?

606
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,500
Leave my children out of it.

607
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,900
But I think Sam's trying to say
something with that drawing.

608
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,500
Something he can't put into words.

609
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,000
What do you mean?

610
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,700
He's drawing a little boy
that's afraid...

611
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,100
...because his dad's not
around to protect him

612
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,700
or his family.

613
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,200
I told him he's not alone.

614
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,400
I know what it's like to have
parents who have split up.

615
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,800
I told him
I'd been through it, and...

616
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
I think I turned out okay, so...

617
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,900
I think you turned out better
than okay, Jimmy.

618
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,400
I appreciate that.

619
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,100
So, I guess I'll head back
to the house then.

620
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,400
See you there.

621
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,000
Thank you, Jimmy.

622
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,200
Sure.

623
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,700
- How did it go?
- Good.

624
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,300
Turbines all went up without a hitch.

625
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,700
Thank...

626
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,800
Thank you.

627
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,800
You were as good as your word.
Even better.

628
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,000
I'm glad you see it that way,

629
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,900
because I have another
proposition for you.

630
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,900
We need salt.

631
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,000
Well, it's no problem.
I'll have my guys load up your truck.

632
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,500
Well, actually,

633
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,100
I mean to help you sell it.

634
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,800
We were thinking
a quarter stake in the mine.

635
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,600
Would we be Constantino?

636
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,400
Is that what all of
this good will was about?

637
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,000
No. Hear me out.

638
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,000
This will work for both of us.

639
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,300
For both of our towns.

640
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,200
If you agree to let me sell salt
from the mine.

641
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,900
I'm sorry.

642
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,300
I guess you and the, uh, Olsen twins
think this is kind of cute.

643
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,400
Well, for whatever it's worth,
we did conduct a legal transaction.

644
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,200
- Not for sale.
- Your people on New Bern

645
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,299
who think it should be.
- I don't care what they think.

646
00:41:06,357 --> 00:41:07,800
You need to.

647
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,400
When I saw that

648
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,600
map of Jericho,

649
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,500
I asked Heather about it.

650
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,100
She didn't think

651
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,500
New Bern could do that to us.

652
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,300
Then she snuck in, and, uh...

653
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,800
she saw the mortars and...

654
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,900
their plans.

655
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,600
Look, you're going back to whatever

656
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,200
rock you crawled out from under.

657
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,500
Dan, get in here!

658
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,300
Mr. Mayor, there's a lot more
going on here than you realize.

659
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,300
- Is that so?
- I'm trying to help you.

660
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,400
Look, New Bern barely
survived the winter.

661
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,000
And the people there, they know
the food is coming from you.

662
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,000
And they also know that it's not going
to be enough to feed everyone,

663
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,000
and so, some of them, they're thinking,
what can we do about that

664
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,200
right now?

665
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,900
I want you to find every deputy you can
and get them up to the salt mine.

666
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,600
I want it under heavy guard
until further notice.

667
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,300
Gray, I've already got men up there.

668
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,400
Gray, listen to me.

669
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,700
This deal is a good thing.

670
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,300
I know you don't see it that way
right now, but please,

671
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,800
you do not want the alternative.

672
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,200
These rumors about Jericho,

673
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,900
about the food hoarding,

674
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,200
about how they sicced Ravenwood on us...

675
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,900
maybe they're not just rumors.

676
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,200
We restored their power supply,

677
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,400
and now that Jericho has what it needs,

678
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,500
it has no intention of making good
on its half of the deal.

679
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,400
Why didn't you just leave town?

680
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,300
'Cause we wanted to break the machine,

681
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,100
stop the factory.

682
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,600
Then they caught us.

683
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,200
They brought me here.

684
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,200
So, where is she?

685
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,200
Where is Heather?

686
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,400
She's dead, Jake.

687
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,300
But it's not enough for them
to keep their food

688
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,700
and leave us to starve.

689
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,500
You, up. You, too.

690
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,400
They want to see us destroyed.

691
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,500
I looked their mayor in the eye,

692
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,100
I told him how desperate
our situation was.

693
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,000
But on the day

694
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,500
that we made good
on our end of the deal,

695
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,100
what did they do?

696
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,600
They tried to destroy the factory

697
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,400
that keeps this town alive.

698
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,700
Here's your proof.

699
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,000
These are the sons of Johnston Green,

700
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,800
sent from Jericho to wreak
havoc on this town.

701
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,900
Now we know,

702
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,600
if these people had their way,

703
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,000
New Bern would cease to exist.

704
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,700
With your help

705
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,300
and sacrifice,

706
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,300
I will make sure that
that never happens.
