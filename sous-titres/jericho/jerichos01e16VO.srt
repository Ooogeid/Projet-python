<i>Previously on </i>Jericho

2
00:00:01,727 --> 00:00:03,856
When were you planning
on telling me about the baby?

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,420
A bad marriage doesn't get better
because you add a kid.

4
00:00:06,497 --> 00:00:08,966
I didn't want you to stay with me
because of the baby, Eric.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,530
Heather!

6
00:00:10,954 --> 00:00:11,997
My God.

7
00:00:13,149 --> 00:00:14,957
Uh... Jake, this is Ted Lewis.

8
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,222
We grew up together
over in New Bern.

9
00:00:17,223 --> 00:00:18,612
This is Russell and Mike.

10
00:00:18,613 --> 00:00:19,621
- Hey.
- Yeah, we met.

11
00:00:19,622 --> 00:00:21,163
With a dozen full-size windmills,

12
00:00:21,164 --> 00:00:22,442
you could power the whole town.

13
00:00:22,443 --> 00:00:24,898
I'm going to help turn the lights on
for everyone back home.

14
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,101
- Just going to leave?
- It won't be for very long.

15
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:31,986
I have something
in my possession

16
00:00:32,138 --> 00:00:35,170
and it puts you, me and the kids
in danger here.

17
00:00:35,188 --> 00:00:37,068
Sarah is not on our side.

18
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,913
She's not here to help us.

19
00:00:39,012 --> 00:00:40,940
Hawkins is starting
to put the pieces together.

20
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:43,249
- He needs to be eliminated.
- I know.

21
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,880
Why are you stalling on this one?

22
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,190
How can I be sure
you won't follow me?

23
00:00:54,191 --> 00:00:55,206
I won't follow you.

24
00:00:55,207 --> 00:00:57,168
Not if I take your son with me,
you won't.

25
00:01:57,671 --> 00:02:00,029
Honey, you look tired.

26
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:01,571
You getting enough sleep?

27
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:03,303
Almost seven hours.

28
00:02:03,598 --> 00:02:05,099
- Where?
- In my office.

29
00:02:05,568 --> 00:02:07,632
Sleeping in your office
doesn't count.

30
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,761
You're going to give
the baby a crick in its neck.

31
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,490
You're going to make
a terrific grandmother.

32
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:13,210
- I know.
- You're Dr. Green? - Yes.

33
00:02:13,514 --> 00:02:15,337
Jessica Williams.
Nice to meet you.

34
00:02:15,672 --> 00:02:17,937
Mr. Ostrowski says
he's having chest pains.

35
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:20,027
He doesn't want anybody
to look at him but you.

36
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,359
Are you the doctor
who came in with the refugees?

37
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,299
Close. Third-year med student,
University of Chicago.

38
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,390
And I prefer
"visitor" to "refugee."

39
00:02:27,556 --> 00:02:29,406
I'm sorry.
Thanks for the help.

40
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:30,974
Don't thank me.

41
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:33,105
I'm just working here
'cause I get to sleep in a bed

42
00:02:33,106 --> 00:02:34,686
instead of the church basement.

43
00:02:35,504 --> 00:02:36,683
Where do I start?

44
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:40,530
Pneumonia,
malnutrition, hypothermia.

45
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:42,192
Just grab a chart
and pick a patient.

46
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:47,111
- Mr. Hawkins?
- Hey, Jim.

47
00:02:47,594 --> 00:02:49,242
Hope I didn't wake the kids.

48
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:50,770
No, you're okay.

49
00:02:51,883 --> 00:02:53,799
Mine are the same way.
Up at all hours.

50
00:02:54,026 --> 00:02:55,118
Worse when we had TV.

51
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:56,854
Is there something
I can do for you, Jim?

52
00:02:58,018 --> 00:02:59,158
Sorry. Um...

53
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,099
Mayor Anderson wants me
to keep track of the refugees.

54
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:03,159
You know,

55
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,968
find out where they end up.

56
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:07,448
See what kind of work
they're doing to help the town.

57
00:03:07,851 --> 00:03:08,870
Sarah Mason.

58
00:03:09,111 --> 00:03:10,853
She's been...
staying with you, right?

59
00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:16,804
Mr. Hawkins...

60
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:20,343
It's freezing out here. Uh...

61
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,796
Is she around?

62
00:03:25,235 --> 00:03:27,621
- Oh, the generator's back on.
- Thank God.

63
00:03:29,046 --> 00:03:30,157
Well, that's it.

64
00:03:30,198 --> 00:03:31,525
We're on our last tank of diesel.

65
00:03:31,526 --> 00:03:33,375
Power's out to everything
but the medical center.

66
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:35,673
Our last tank?
How long will we have power?

67
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,039
Ten, maybe 12 hours,

68
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,808
so turn off anything
you're not using.

69
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,255
What about the biodiesel?

70
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:41,408
We burned through it.

71
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:42,735
We're not going
to have any more for days.

72
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:44,277
We need to come up
with another plan.

73
00:03:44,278 --> 00:03:46,467
We're getting more and
more people in here every...

74
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,371
Oh, God!

75
00:03:50,214 --> 00:03:51,219
April, can you hear me?

76
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,975
Is she breathing?
April, wake up!

77
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,790
Get over here!

00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:15,910
It's colder than a witch's patootie.

83
00:04:22,077 --> 00:04:23,257
Using candles.

84
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:27,398
I saw you had some electric lights on
when I was walking up.

85
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,188
I got a geni
in the basement, but, uh...

86
00:04:33,644 --> 00:04:35,748
I just used the last of my gas.

87
00:04:36,745 --> 00:04:37,991
What were you doing?

88
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,616
I'm putting some stuff
in storage, but, uh...

89
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,187
I was just cleaning up.

90
00:04:46,863 --> 00:04:49,035
Using the last of your fuel
on housework, huh?

91
00:04:49,036 --> 00:04:50,402
Darcy's trained you well.

92
00:04:52,278 --> 00:04:53,498
Listen, Jimmy, um...

93
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:55,428
I was just about to turn in, so...

94
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,003
Right. Sorry.

95
00:04:57,057 --> 00:04:58,934
Uh, well, like I said,

96
00:04:58,935 --> 00:05:01,749
Mayor Anderson's got me keeping
tabs on the refugees, you know.

97
00:05:02,138 --> 00:05:03,290
Crime's up.

98
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,317
So, Sarah Mason.

99
00:05:06,588 --> 00:05:08,545
Is she here?
Can I ask her some questions?

100
00:05:08,546 --> 00:05:09,711
You know, um...

101
00:05:11,977 --> 00:05:13,867
Sarah left yesterday.

102
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,346
Something about, uh...

103
00:05:16,347 --> 00:05:18,062
family in New Orleans.

104
00:05:20,824 --> 00:05:22,365
Wow. In this weather?

105
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:26,748
Well, I'm sorry to bother you.

106
00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:28,209
Hey, don't worry about it.

107
00:05:31,426 --> 00:05:32,672
You know, that's a...

108
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:34,857
nasty- looking cut
you got there.

109
00:05:35,558 --> 00:05:37,917
Uh, yeah, it was, uh...

110
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,021
tree branch when
I was cutting wood.

111
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:44,970
- Must have been a real bleeder.
- Hey, it's not too deep.

112
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:48,253
Well, you be careful.

113
00:05:48,392 --> 00:05:49,853
It's dangerous out there.

114
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:52,279
Again, sorry to bother you.

115
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,365
Yes.

116
00:05:57,928 --> 00:05:59,550
I don't feel good.

117
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:01,445
I'm so tired all of a sudden.

118
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,825
I know.

119
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:05,309
I told you you need
to get some rest.

120
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:07,088
Here's your big chance.

121
00:06:09,393 --> 00:06:11,887
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you, honey.

122
00:06:15,224 --> 00:06:16,859
I'm trying to keep her calm,

123
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,687
but my gut tells me
the baby's having a problem,

124
00:06:19,688 --> 00:06:21,623
and if I know it, she knows it.

125
00:06:21,624 --> 00:06:23,647
- What are we going to do?
- Get Kenchy?

126
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:25,328
There's another doctor in town?

127
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:27,357
The man can barely
sit up on his bar stool.

128
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:29,743
Look, what I really need is
an ultrasound machine.

129
00:06:29,744 --> 00:06:32,370
Without it, there's no real way
to know what's going on.

130
00:06:32,463 --> 00:06:35,599
Well, maybe we have one that
survived the EMP in the basement.

131
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,208
- I'll go look.
- Good.

132
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,822
You go get your father
and tell him to find Eric.

133
00:06:39,929 --> 00:06:41,564
He's the one who should be here.

134
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:50,626
It's the guys from New Bern.

135
00:06:51,446 --> 00:06:54,297
They actually built the thing.
I can't believe it.

136
00:06:54,766 --> 00:06:55,854
Hey, Russell.

137
00:06:56,322 --> 00:06:58,901
- Hey. Sheriff, good to see you.
- Good to see you.

138
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,944
Johnston, you SOB.

139
00:07:00,945 --> 00:07:03,449
- How the hell did you lose an election?
- No, the question is,

140
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,298
how did you get
to be in charge in New Bern?

141
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,995
They get tired of you
being the sheriff?

142
00:07:06,996 --> 00:07:08,251
No, I'm still sheriff.

143
00:07:08,351 --> 00:07:09,707
Just got a little more authority.

144
00:07:11,482 --> 00:07:13,189
Well, this is our new mayor.

145
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,512
This is Gray Anderson.

146
00:07:14,814 --> 00:07:16,789
- Mayor Anderson.
- Nice to meet you.

147
00:07:17,314 --> 00:07:18,553
Congratulations.

148
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:21,270
Thank you. Thank you.
So, this is the windmill, huh?

149
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:23,464
It's a power-generating wind turbine.

150
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:25,909
We get about 1,500 watts an hour
out of one of these.

151
00:07:28,526 --> 00:07:30,502
- Have you seen Eric?
- No, did you try Mary's?

152
00:07:30,503 --> 00:07:32,679
Yeah. I tried there.
I tried at Bailey's.

153
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:35,358
Does this thing work?
Can we get power from it?

154
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:36,714
Probably some time tomorrow.

155
00:07:36,715 --> 00:07:38,120
Let's get it up as fast as we can.

156
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:40,018
I think we're going to need it
at the medical center.

157
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:41,852
- You got it.
- There's something wrong with April.

158
00:07:41,853 --> 00:07:42,870
What? What is it?

159
00:07:42,871 --> 00:07:45,565
She passed out. They think
there's a problem with the baby.

160
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:52,546
I'll pick you up at 5:00.

161
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:53,851
I'll walk.

162
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:58,142
Stanley thinks that you're using
this whole volunteering thing

163
00:07:58,143 --> 00:07:59,917
as an excuse
to see Sean Henthorn.

164
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:01,910
I'm just following orders
to keep an eye on you.

165
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:04,119
Personally, I don't give
a damn who you date.

166
00:08:04,923 --> 00:08:07,769
I've been volunteering here
since I was 16.

167
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:09,851
It's not about Sean.

168
00:08:13,803 --> 00:08:16,314
You volunteer for anything? Ever?

169
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:27,179
Mr. Fredrickson.

170
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:28,836
Come on, stop.

171
00:08:29,143 --> 00:08:32,224
Gracie gave you beet seed
in exchange for 3% of your farm crop.

172
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:34,674
That 3% is mine now.
The store was left to me.

173
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,297
I can't do that, Dale.

174
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:37,771
Things have gotten worse now.

175
00:08:37,772 --> 00:08:40,215
I need it for my family,
to feed the last of my livestock.

176
00:08:40,216 --> 00:08:41,286
I'm sorry.

177
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:43,513
It's the law, Mr. Fredrickson.
It's rightfully mine.

178
00:08:43,514 --> 00:08:45,254
There are no more laws, son.

179
00:08:54,054 --> 00:08:55,460
No.

180
00:08:59,595 --> 00:09:00,801
I volunteered.

181
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:03,111
So. What do I do?

182
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:10,327
Empty. Clean. Repeat.

183
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:13,741
Where the hell is Eric?

184
00:09:13,908 --> 00:09:16,453
Nobody knows.
Dad's getting Bill on it.

185
00:09:16,787 --> 00:09:18,277
Her blood pressure's dropping.

186
00:09:25,462 --> 00:09:27,990
- I'm feeling contractions.
- I think she's going into labor.

187
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:29,429
No, no, I can't.

188
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:31,204
The baby's only 16 weeks.

189
00:09:31,957 --> 00:09:34,385
I need, I need ritodrine
to stop the labor.

190
00:09:34,386 --> 00:09:35,863
I already checked.
We don't have any more.

191
00:09:35,864 --> 00:09:37,403
I'll try to find some nifedipine.

192
00:09:37,637 --> 00:09:39,094
All right, now what are you feeling?

193
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:41,471
If I lose consciousness,
and you can't find any medicine,

194
00:09:41,973 --> 00:09:42,978
use alcohol.

195
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:44,735
What do you mean?
What kind of alcohol?

196
00:09:44,936 --> 00:09:46,811
Anything coming out of the still.

197
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,221
Give me a 10% drip.

198
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:52,156
It'll stop the contractions.

199
00:09:55,118 --> 00:09:57,312
Oh, God, she's bleeding.

200
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,035
Get Kenchy. Now!

201
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:08,876
I'm so cold my mouth is numb.

202
00:10:10,816 --> 00:10:13,659
We need the logs or we're
going to freeze to death.

203
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:15,802
Isn't that what we're doing now?

204
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:19,441
All right. Let's get in the car.

205
00:10:30,324 --> 00:10:31,343
Blanket.

206
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:32,783
Let's turn on the heat.

207
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,118
We can't. I'm sorry.

208
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:36,667
We won't have enough gas to get home.

209
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,897
You know, we could make our own heat.

210
00:10:47,135 --> 00:10:48,374
Don't get any ideas...

211
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,180
I'm not taking my clothes off.

212
00:10:55,317 --> 00:10:57,201
You know how happy you make me.

213
00:10:58,697 --> 00:11:00,555
I'm still not taking my clothes off.

214
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:07,493
Come on!

215
00:11:10,293 --> 00:11:11,352
What's her pressure?

216
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,694
- You smell like a wino.
- Nice to meet you too.

217
00:11:13,695 --> 00:11:16,216
- What's her pressure, please ?
- 80/44 and dropping.

218
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,907
- Is she dilated?
- Two centimeters.

219
00:11:17,908 --> 00:11:19,766
Her contractions are six minutes apart.

220
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:21,684
I need an ultrasound.

221
00:11:21,701 --> 00:11:23,095
I brought some old ones
up from the basement.

222
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:24,307
I'll go check on them now.

223
00:11:25,856 --> 00:11:27,378
- Do we have fresh plasma?
- No.

224
00:11:27,682 --> 00:11:28,883
I need you to find somebody...

225
00:11:28,884 --> 00:11:30,277
- With O-negative blood.
- Yes.

226
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:33,090
And we need
a fetal heart monitor.

227
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,638
Do we have that?
No?

228
00:11:35,064 --> 00:11:38,166
I need you to put these on
and monitor the baby's heart rate.

229
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:39,351
Here, put these in your ear.

230
00:11:39,352 --> 00:11:40,486
I'll show you how to listen.

231
00:11:40,487 --> 00:11:41,498
I'm deaf.

232
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,371
Madam?

233
00:11:47,732 --> 00:11:48,842
I need you to put these in ears.

234
00:11:48,843 --> 00:11:50,235
I need you to monitor
the baby's heart rate.

235
00:11:50,236 --> 00:11:52,222
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. I will show you how.

236
00:11:52,223 --> 00:11:54,313
Come on, let's go! Please!

237
00:11:55,846 --> 00:11:57,033
Here we go. Put these on.

238
00:11:57,034 --> 00:11:58,272
Listen right here.

239
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,472
Now, the higher one,
the fast one.

240
00:12:01,473 --> 00:12:02,633
You hear that?

241
00:12:02,726 --> 00:12:03,898
That's the baby's heart rate.

242
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:05,550
You count 15 seconds,

243
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:08,153
and then you multiply
that by four.

244
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,192
- To get the beats per minute.
- Perfect

245
00:12:10,502 --> 00:12:12,979
now I will show you
how to take blood pressure

246
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,035
and pulse rate.

247
00:12:17,468 --> 00:12:19,274
All right, let's get ready to lift it.

248
00:12:19,403 --> 00:12:21,416
You want me to settle
a contract dispute?!

249
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:23,635
Mr. Fredrickson isn't giving
Dale his share.

250
00:12:24,274 --> 00:12:25,538
You're kidding me, right?

251
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,164
I'm trying to get power restored.

252
00:12:27,165 --> 00:12:29,096
I got home robberies all over town.

253
00:12:29,113 --> 00:12:31,512
The refugees are threatening
to break into the food lockup.

254
00:12:31,513 --> 00:12:33,125
Okay, we're going to go on three.

255
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,235
One...

256
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:35,525
two...

257
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:36,732
three.

258
00:12:38,746 --> 00:12:39,753
There we go.

259
00:12:40,295 --> 00:12:42,024
A little higher, a little higher.

260
00:12:42,256 --> 00:12:43,598
Okay, easy

261
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,673
Got it.

262
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:48,218
Watch the rope.

263
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:50,334
There you go.

264
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:52,502
Keep it going.

265
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:53,793
Almost there.

266
00:12:53,922 --> 00:12:55,238
You got enough on your side?

267
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:56,683
Keep it taut.

268
00:12:57,066 --> 00:12:58,408
Good job, fellas.

269
00:13:03,914 --> 00:13:04,926
How's the baby?

270
00:13:04,927 --> 00:13:06,518
I don't know.
How close is this?

271
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,300
I don't know, hours, at least.
Did you find Eric?

272
00:13:08,376 --> 00:13:11,060
No. Bill and the rangers
are out looking for him.

273
00:13:19,749 --> 00:13:21,839
Can we buy some more of these things?

274
00:13:23,426 --> 00:13:24,897
Yeah. Let's talk about it.

275
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:34,344
<i>Mr. Hawkins!</i>

276
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:36,383
<i>I'm back!</i>

277
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,996
<i>Mr. Hawkins, you around?</i>

278
00:13:43,325 --> 00:13:44,693
Just a second!

279
00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:00,177
You weren't answering
your front door, so I just...

280
00:14:02,138 --> 00:14:03,944
You doing some yard work?
You need a hand?

281
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:05,957
No. No, thank you.

282
00:14:06,768 --> 00:14:08,094
I was going to turn some compost.

283
00:14:08,095 --> 00:14:09,953
Getting ready to plant
food for the spring.

284
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:12,250
That's a good idea.

285
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:14,160
Margaret's planting carrots inside.

286
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:16,895
They're a super-food,
you know...

287
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:18,352
like broccoli.

288
00:14:18,728 --> 00:14:20,663
You need something, Jimmy?

289
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:23,870
Gray wants me to find out
what kind of resources

290
00:14:23,901 --> 00:14:25,575
Sarah might've taken with her, you know?

291
00:14:25,935 --> 00:14:27,593
Fuel, food. Did she...

292
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,144
drive out of town?
- She didn't drive.

293
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,772
Took a backpack.

294
00:14:33,348 --> 00:14:35,181
Some food...
a tent.

295
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:37,181
Then just walked out into the cold, huh?

296
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,233
That's crazy.

297
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,973
Maybe Darcy knows something more.

298
00:14:44,004 --> 00:14:45,052
No, I don't think so.

299
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:46,570
I just figured,

300
00:14:46,883 --> 00:14:49,777
you know, women talk, and who knows
what the hell they say, right?

301
00:14:54,448 --> 00:14:55,793
Is Darcy around?
Can I...

302
00:14:55,887 --> 00:14:57,014
can I speak with her?

303
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:04,124
Darcy and I are having problems.

304
00:15:05,141 --> 00:15:06,267
She's moved out.

305
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,412
Boy, that's tough.

306
00:15:10,627 --> 00:15:12,630
A lot of people leaving you lately, huh?

307
00:15:14,194 --> 00:15:15,430
I'm-I'm sorry.

308
00:15:15,602 --> 00:15:17,120
That's insensitive. I...

309
00:15:18,388 --> 00:15:19,988
I will get my coat.

310
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,652
I'll take you to her, Jimmy.

311
00:15:23,503 --> 00:15:24,819
Really?

312
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:38,633
<i>Hey, how are your, uh,
communication skills?</i>

313
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:42,447
You know, 'cause that's really
what marriage is all about.

314
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:46,241
<i>Honesty, love.</i>

315
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,002
<i>I'd say it's 50-50.</i>

316
00:15:49,313 --> 00:15:51,325
<i>Sort of like half and half, you know?</i>

317
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:56,461
Well, actually, more like thirds,
if you throw respect in there.

318
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,384
<i>But not equal thirds, 'cause honesty...</i>

319
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:01,842
<i>is more important than
the love and the respect.</i>

320
00:16:03,687 --> 00:16:04,696
<i>I think.</i>

321
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,454
You got one of the only
salt mines around for 400 miles.

322
00:16:08,024 --> 00:16:10,450
A year without salt, and New Bern
will be a ghost town.

323
00:16:10,631 --> 00:16:12,179
What are we talking about,
a couple hundred pounds?

324
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:14,037
No, we need a lot more than that.

325
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:16,579
- We're going to need food.
- No food to spare.

326
00:16:16,593 --> 00:16:18,141
Won't see another crop till spring.

327
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,025
Spring crop's what I'm talking about.

328
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:22,645
Ten wind turbines for,
let's say...

329
00:16:22,794 --> 00:16:24,064
ten percent of your spring crop.

330
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:25,483
No, we can't put ourselves
in that position.

331
00:16:25,535 --> 00:16:27,522
Spring crop might not even
get us to next year.

332
00:16:27,672 --> 00:16:30,522
If we lose ten percent, we'll just be
in the same position we are now.

333
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:31,529
Worse.

334
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:33,693
Look, all we're asking you
to do is be reasonable.

335
00:16:33,822 --> 00:16:35,319
Well, we're just trying to survive.

336
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:41,770
Starve next fall or freeze
this winter...

337
00:16:41,974 --> 00:16:43,239
take your pick.

338
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,694
Vancomycin... good.

339
00:17:03,746 --> 00:17:05,656
Start a drip: 250 milligrams IV.

340
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:08,301
I'll do it.

341
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:10,262
We found four people who are O-negative.

342
00:17:10,804 --> 00:17:12,959
- Fetal heart rate is 169.
- I'll get it off the ultrasound.

343
00:17:12,985 --> 00:17:14,920
Her blood pressure is 130/70.

344
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:17,965
Her respiratory rate is 18,
and her pulse is 88, it's going up.

345
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:18,971
She's losing blood.

346
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:20,959
Her heart's compensating
by pumping harder.

347
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,481
Start an IV for the blood.

348
00:17:28,907 --> 00:17:30,327
What do you see?

349
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:34,275
- Placenta previa.
- What's that?

350
00:17:34,378 --> 00:17:36,288
The placenta is covering
the entire cervix.

351
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,316
There's no way for me to find out
where the bleed is coming from

352
00:17:38,317 --> 00:17:39,590
unless we operate.

353
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,757
Well, what are we going to do?

354
00:17:40,808 --> 00:17:44,008
Under the best of circumstances,
this is not an operating facility.

355
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:46,656
- Then we don't have a choice.
- Cannot operate here.

356
00:17:46,704 --> 00:17:47,718
Why?

357
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,582
I have been through this more times
than you could possibly imagine.

358
00:17:51,597 --> 00:17:53,403
We've all been through a lot, all right?
Just tell us...

359
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:55,855
I have seen
hundreds of people die

360
00:17:55,984 --> 00:17:57,687
because of dirty facilities
and infection

361
00:17:57,713 --> 00:17:59,571
and because I didn't have
the proper medicine

362
00:17:59,597 --> 00:18:00,883
or the equipment
that I needed.

363
00:18:00,887 --> 00:18:02,152
I am not doing it again.

364
00:18:02,229 --> 00:18:04,009
We are not losing this baby.

365
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,848
You can find yourself another butcher.

366
00:18:13,713 --> 00:18:15,003
There's got to be a way.

367
00:18:17,534 --> 00:18:19,444
Kenchy. Listen,

368
00:18:19,702 --> 00:18:21,663
we need a sterile operating room,

369
00:18:22,128 --> 00:18:23,599
sterile instruments,

370
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:26,089
anesthesia, spinal block tray,
caesarian tray.

371
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:28,411
Have you ever even seen a surgery
performed without

372
00:18:28,412 --> 00:18:29,441
an electrocautery machine?

373
00:18:29,448 --> 00:18:31,352
No, you haven't. Because
this doesn't even taught anymore.

374
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:34,190
Can't we just use laparotomy
sponges to stop the bleeding?

375
00:18:34,732 --> 00:18:36,281
God, my head is killing me.

376
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:38,577
We've got several spinal block trays,

377
00:18:38,629 --> 00:18:39,919
and we've got anesthesia.

378
00:18:39,984 --> 00:18:42,487
And we can boil
the sheets and the tools.

379
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,171
Is it possible?

380
00:18:47,977 --> 00:18:50,248
- Remotely.
- Then start.

381
00:18:51,512 --> 00:18:53,732
- We need bleach.
- What?

382
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,145
Bleach.
You know? Bleach.

383
00:18:58,568 --> 00:19:01,098
Bonnie, look at my lips.
Bleach !

384
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,136
Learn.

385
00:19:06,156 --> 00:19:08,452
- Is that the word for "bleach"?
- No.

386
00:19:08,508 --> 00:19:09,514
"Bitch."

387
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,766
And... "please."

388
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:16,669
And "sorry."

389
00:19:44,455 --> 00:19:46,210
I'm heading out.

390
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,422
If I'm not back, lock up at dark

391
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:51,254
and don't let anyone in.

392
00:19:52,183 --> 00:19:54,686
Also, if I'm not around ever

393
00:19:54,815 --> 00:19:57,860
and you need anything,
just talk to Gail Green or Johnston.

394
00:19:57,904 --> 00:19:59,401
You can trust them.

395
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,943
I'm going to come with you.

396
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,717
Why?

397
00:20:09,671 --> 00:20:11,425
Two against one.

398
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:24,284
Hey, Bill.

399
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:27,717
What's wrong?

400
00:20:30,465 --> 00:20:32,364
I just jumped in.

401
00:20:33,521 --> 00:20:34,540
It was...

402
00:20:37,178 --> 00:20:38,964
It was just in the moment.

403
00:20:39,102 --> 00:20:42,326
You volunteered at the medical center
long before I ever get here.

404
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:44,017
It's fine.

405
00:20:44,883 --> 00:20:46,767
Kenchy just doesn't know you.

406
00:20:47,101 --> 00:20:49,237
Everybody else respects you.

407
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:52,461
They speak your language.

408
00:20:59,987 --> 00:21:02,373
- Hey, we got a problem.
- What's that?

409
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:05,811
Eddie and Frank are asking
how come you're not making the deal.

410
00:21:06,104 --> 00:21:08,044
Words are gonna start to spread.

411
00:21:08,215 --> 00:21:09,699
As far as they know,
the marines said that

412
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,060
the army corp of engineers would
be here within the month.

413
00:21:12,124 --> 00:21:14,692
What difference does it make if we give
New Bern a part of next year's profit?

414
00:21:14,693 --> 00:21:16,370
They think there's going
to be food by then.

415
00:21:16,371 --> 00:21:18,937
You didn't want to tell them it was
a bunch of crap, so now what do we do?

416
00:21:18,938 --> 00:21:20,305
All right,

417
00:21:20,805 --> 00:21:23,150
maybe we should tell the town
that help's not coming.

418
00:21:23,336 --> 00:21:26,072
We just told them that to give 'em
something to get through winter.

419
00:21:26,073 --> 00:21:28,178
Town's already on the edge,
you'll have anarchy.

420
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:29,896
And I'm not leverage
next winter's food,

421
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:31,054
that'd be suicide.

422
00:21:33,747 --> 00:21:34,932
What if we tell New Bern that

423
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:36,929
we'll give them
10% of next year's crop.

424
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,589
We get power now.

425
00:21:39,287 --> 00:21:42,090
If next year we don't have
the food to give, we don't give it up.

426
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:45,721
That's how wars get started.

427
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,881
I can't believe Darcy is staying
at the refugee shelter.

428
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:54,975
Hey, Jim,

429
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,887
let me talk to her a second.

430
00:21:57,738 --> 00:21:59,427
- Sure.
- Thanks.

431
00:22:06,272 --> 00:22:08,379
I asked you to stay away.

432
00:22:08,635 --> 00:22:10,700
Jimmy wanted to ask you
some questions...

433
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,714
about Sarah.

434
00:22:16,272 --> 00:22:17,653
Where are the kids?

435
00:22:18,141 --> 00:22:19,886
They're in the gym, playing.

436
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:23,054
We need a consistent cover story.

437
00:22:26,627 --> 00:22:27,897
What'd you do with her body?

438
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,284
I buried her.

439
00:22:35,126 --> 00:22:37,010
So I can tell them that right now,

440
00:22:37,011 --> 00:22:38,424
and never see you again.

441
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,932
I could tell him about...

442
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:42,135
- What did you call it... "the package"?
- Stop it!

443
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:47,213
You understand the story?

444
00:22:47,581 --> 00:22:49,326
Family? New Orleans?

445
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,922
And you don't know
anything else about her.

446
00:22:55,032 --> 00:22:56,399
This'll just take a sec.

447
00:22:56,818 --> 00:22:59,135
Yeah, well, I don't want
to talk to you in front of him.

448
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:03,949
Why don't you give us
a minute, Mr. Hawkins?

449
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:08,095
I'll be out front...

450
00:23:09,016 --> 00:23:10,397
let you two talk.

451
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,476
You're going to be okay, angel.

452
00:23:25,147 --> 00:23:26,863
Did you ever do
a surgical rotation?

453
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:27,998
Only in school.

454
00:23:28,047 --> 00:23:29,722
Most of my career was in post-op.

455
00:23:31,341 --> 00:23:34,230
I feel obligated to ask you
if you're sober enough to do this.

456
00:23:34,244 --> 00:23:35,849
You can talk me through it.

457
00:23:36,337 --> 00:23:38,473
You will refer to me
as Dr. Dhuwalia, Nurse.

458
00:23:38,474 --> 00:23:40,293
And my sobriety is not the issue.

459
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:43,405
The people I call "doctor"
don't smell like a brewery.

460
00:23:43,406 --> 00:23:45,932
Respirations are 16.
Pulse rate is 82.

461
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:48,044
Her blood pressure's down to 100/62.

462
00:23:48,045 --> 00:23:49,594
God help us.

463
00:23:54,638 --> 00:23:56,368
- Is the baby okay?
- I don't know.

464
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,280
Mom said there's a problem.

465
00:23:58,377 --> 00:24:00,177
We were just
collecting firewood.

466
00:24:00,178 --> 00:24:01,717
You don't have
to explain it to me.

467
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,043
What about Mom?

468
00:24:03,369 --> 00:24:04,834
Don't worry about that.

469
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:17,759
Shut the door.

470
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,207
We're losing too much blood.
Clamp it off.

471
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,377
Get away from the incision!

472
00:24:30,378 --> 00:24:32,205
I need to hear
if the baby's in distress.

473
00:24:32,964 --> 00:24:34,792
Get away from the incision.

474
00:24:34,793 --> 00:24:37,541
You haven't let me get
a pulse from this baby in an hour.

475
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,853
Respirations are 16, pulse is 84.

476
00:24:40,577 --> 00:24:42,963
Fetal heart rate is less than
five beats per minute.

477
00:24:42,964 --> 00:24:45,424
You're not close enough to the fetus.
It's not an accurate measurement.

478
00:24:45,425 --> 00:24:48,063
The placenta's grown into
the uterus wall. It's ripping away.

479
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:50,171
- That's what's causing the bleeding.
- Now I've lost it.

480
00:24:50,172 --> 00:24:51,980
- I can't hear anything.
- What is going on?

481
00:24:51,981 --> 00:24:53,487
The baby's heart beat has stopped.

482
00:24:53,488 --> 00:24:55,558
- What do you mean, it's stopped?
- Do something.

483
00:24:58,113 --> 00:24:59,801
That must be
the last of the diesel.

484
00:24:59,802 --> 00:25:00,974
Open the door.

485
00:25:01,392 --> 00:25:02,774
Open the blinds.
I need light.

486
00:25:02,775 --> 00:25:05,444
Why aren't you doing
something about the baby?

487
00:25:06,845 --> 00:25:08,980
This hasn't been about
the baby for several hours.

488
00:25:08,981 --> 00:25:10,752
The baby never really had a chance.

489
00:25:10,753 --> 00:25:12,748
- I'm sorry.
- What are you saying?

490
00:25:15,001 --> 00:25:17,346
I am trying to save April.

491
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:38,741
- What do you want?
- Same thing as before.

492
00:25:39,073 --> 00:25:42,427
- My share of the crop.
- I told you I can't do that. Go home.

493
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,164
I'm only asking for what's mine.

494
00:25:51,988 --> 00:25:53,537
You said there's no law, right?

495
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:55,574
I'm not trying to cheat anybody.

496
00:25:55,979 --> 00:25:57,403
I don't have that much left.

497
00:25:57,404 --> 00:25:59,356
Then give my share
of whatever you got.

498
00:26:00,011 --> 00:26:01,044
Right now.

499
00:26:14,286 --> 00:26:16,072
- What's going on?
- I... I just...

500
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:18,459
need some space right now.

501
00:26:23,336 --> 00:26:24,564
We lost the baby.

502
00:26:29,184 --> 00:26:30,384
Oh, sweetie...

503
00:26:34,362 --> 00:26:36,037
I need to be
with April right now.

504
00:27:03,403 --> 00:27:04,757
What took you so long?

505
00:27:05,734 --> 00:27:08,483
Well after...
talking with Darcy, uh...

506
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,317
a lot of things are starting
to make sense now.

507
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,280
You all right, Mr. Hawkins?

508
00:27:17,634 --> 00:27:18,904
I'm fine.

509
00:27:21,654 --> 00:27:22,993
Well, Darcy said...

510
00:27:24,724 --> 00:27:27,585
that Sarah left for New Orleans,
just like you told me.

511
00:27:29,665 --> 00:27:31,591
What? You think I was lying?

512
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,305
I told Darcy she and the kids
can come stay with us.

513
00:27:35,385 --> 00:27:37,581
She doesn't need
to be staying in the shelter.

514
00:27:38,135 --> 00:27:39,862
Thanks, Jimmy.
I appreciate that.

515
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,840
We found a body, Robert.

516
00:27:53,076 --> 00:27:54,322
Out in the woods.

517
00:27:57,188 --> 00:27:59,692
Near Mill Creek.
Broken neck.

518
00:27:59,947 --> 00:28:01,313
Animals got to it.

519
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,949
Michael Connor was on patrol,

520
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,423
said he saw
an African-American woman

521
00:28:05,424 --> 00:28:07,659
driving out that way
a couple nights ago.

522
00:28:08,636 --> 00:28:10,458
Perfect description of Sarah Mason.

523
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:12,439
Really?

524
00:28:15,062 --> 00:28:16,736
Think she could do
something like that?

525
00:28:18,023 --> 00:28:19,121
I don't know.

526
00:28:20,392 --> 00:28:22,267
You know,
I'm learning that, uh...

527
00:28:22,803 --> 00:28:25,294
it's hard to figure what
people are capable of, Jimmy.

528
00:28:26,527 --> 00:28:28,241
Well, our John Doe was bald.

529
00:28:29,152 --> 00:28:30,518
Know anyone looks like that?

530
00:28:41,003 --> 00:28:42,517
If Sarah comes back...

531
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:45,101
we'd really, really
like to talk to her.

532
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,489
My guess is...

533
00:28:48,221 --> 00:28:49,560
she's not coming back.

534
00:28:52,386 --> 00:28:54,073
That'd be my guess, too.

535
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,617
New Bern's all made of clay,
can't grow nothing.

536
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,470
We need 10% of your spring crop,

537
00:29:05,595 --> 00:29:07,483
and 700 pounds refined salt.

538
00:29:07,484 --> 00:29:09,575
Well, y-you said 500 earlier.

539
00:29:09,576 --> 00:29:11,597
- Price went up.
- Why?

540
00:29:12,012 --> 00:29:14,168
Because that's what
power costs in this world.

541
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,387
Oh, now, come on...

542
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,827
We got people freezing
to death in their homes.

543
00:29:17,828 --> 00:29:18,860
Give us a break.

544
00:29:20,563 --> 00:29:22,202
You were at my son's wedding.

545
00:29:23,711 --> 00:29:25,126
I'm sorry for your troubles.

546
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:27,143
But we got our own.

547
00:29:38,271 --> 00:29:40,278
We'll give you the food.
We'll give you the salt.

548
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:42,177
Everything.

549
00:29:43,528 --> 00:29:45,879
We can have the wind turbines
to you in a couple weeks.

550
00:29:46,344 --> 00:29:48,468
What guarantee do we have
you'll give us our share of the crop?

551
00:29:48,469 --> 00:29:49,750
You have our word.

552
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,644
We're going to need ten Jericho men
to help us build them.

553
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:55,660
We can take them
back with us now.

554
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:58,928
Is this about manpower
for wind turbines?

555
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:02,168
Or is it more about making sure
you get our crops come spring?

556
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:03,804
Human beings as collateral?

557
00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:05,452
I would never do that.

558
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,386
But I am not going
to build these things on credit.

559
00:30:08,387 --> 00:30:10,655
You want them now?
You're going to help make them.

560
00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:14,341
Just hold the pressure.

561
00:30:14,342 --> 00:30:16,419
Put pressure right there.
Right there.

562
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,779
Press, harder!

563
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,656
Damn it! I can't see!

564
00:30:19,657 --> 00:30:21,110
I- I'll get another lantern.

565
00:30:21,293 --> 00:30:23,594
You can bring ten lanterns.
Doesn't make any difference.

566
00:30:23,595 --> 00:30:25,564
It's not going to be enough.
I need real light!

567
00:30:25,565 --> 00:30:27,985
Blood pressure is down to 66/30.

568
00:30:27,986 --> 00:30:29,082
This is crazy.

569
00:30:30,127 --> 00:30:31,280
This is crazy. Close her up.

570
00:30:31,281 --> 00:30:32,996
But we haven't stopped
the bleeding.

571
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,596
- What are you doing?
- Give her some peace.

572
00:30:35,998 --> 00:30:37,311
Give her some dignity.

573
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,434
You are not giving up on her.

574
00:30:39,435 --> 00:30:40,459
I'm sorry.

575
00:30:41,531 --> 00:30:42,577
Close this up.

576
00:30:52,694 --> 00:30:54,074
Where do you think you're going?

577
00:30:54,075 --> 00:30:55,388
You get back inside, right now!

578
00:30:55,707 --> 00:30:57,878
- Come on!
- Take it easy.

579
00:30:58,012 --> 00:30:59,352
Take it easy, all right?

580
00:30:59,728 --> 00:31:01,095
Just let me handle this.

581
00:31:01,096 --> 00:31:02,261
Let me handle it.

582
00:31:03,722 --> 00:31:04,767
What are you doing?

583
00:31:05,438 --> 00:31:07,059
You want me to say it
in front of him?

584
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,111
Go back inside, all right?

585
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:10,518
April needs you.

586
00:31:14,781 --> 00:31:18,601
To go on operating
is cruel and pointless.

587
00:31:20,155 --> 00:31:22,554
Don't even ask me, Jake.
I'm done with this.

588
00:31:22,634 --> 00:31:23,759
I became a plastic surgeon

589
00:31:23,853 --> 00:31:25,877
so I could have the simple, easy life
that other man face.

590
00:31:25,878 --> 00:31:27,691
- Not in this town.
- I don't care.

591
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,481
I'm not going through this anymore.
It is madness.

592
00:31:30,482 --> 00:31:32,384
And everyone here
can just go to hell?

593
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:36,959
If you stop trying, and I stop,
then they see that.

594
00:31:37,226 --> 00:31:39,009
And this whole thing falls apart.

595
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:41,963
We're all leaning on each other here,
whether you like it or not.

596
00:31:41,964 --> 00:31:42,965
Promise me

597
00:31:42,966 --> 00:31:44,515
you are not saying
that we're all connected.

598
00:31:44,516 --> 00:31:46,981
This is not some existential,
web-of-life BS.

599
00:31:46,982 --> 00:31:49,099
That is not what I'm hearing,
is it, Jake?

600
00:31:50,145 --> 00:31:51,900
Then tell me
what you want to hear.

601
00:31:53,951 --> 00:31:55,345
'Cause I'll say anything,

602
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:58,478
if you'll just go back in there
and keep trying.

603
00:32:04,187 --> 00:32:05,742
She's going to die.

604
00:32:11,787 --> 00:32:12,967
I know.

605
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,965
Okay. New gloves.

606
00:32:34,592 --> 00:32:36,725
Let's get this bleeding
stopped, shall we?

607
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,873
- Well, we've got more sponges.
- Excellent!

608
00:32:39,943 --> 00:32:41,815
Pack them in others vascular bleeding.

609
00:32:41,902 --> 00:32:43,494
Just give me time to suture.

610
00:33:14,917 --> 00:33:16,474
He's going to need you.

611
00:33:20,112 --> 00:33:21,136
Now.

612
00:33:38,947 --> 00:33:40,219
Hold my hand.

613
00:33:44,871 --> 00:33:45,992
I'm right here.

614
00:33:48,228 --> 00:33:49,690
I'm right next to you.

615
00:34:00,847 --> 00:34:02,651
I like the name Tracy.

616
00:34:12,155 --> 00:34:14,053
Tracy's a beautiful name.

617
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,486
Thank you for not saying anything.

618
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,803
I didn't do it for you,
I did it for Allison.

619
00:35:47,802 --> 00:35:49,777
I need my family to come home.

620
00:35:51,713 --> 00:35:52,910
I, uh...

621
00:35:54,713 --> 00:35:55,947
I need you.

622
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:01,735
You know, in the last

623
00:36:02,342 --> 00:36:04,526
three months,
I remembered all the reasons

624
00:36:05,001 --> 00:36:06,634
why I need you in my life.

625
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:07,718
So have I.

626
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,836
I've also remembered
why it can never work.

627
00:36:11,526 --> 00:36:15,551
I need truth, Robert, and that's
something you've never given me.

628
00:36:15,623 --> 00:36:19,079
- Everything I do, I do for us.
- Listen.

629
00:36:20,313 --> 00:36:23,256
When you hide a part of yourself,

630
00:36:23,484 --> 00:36:25,326
I don't care what the reason is...

631
00:36:26,156 --> 00:36:27,922
it puts something between us.

632
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,258
Please.

633
00:36:31,245 --> 00:36:33,277
My daughter just killed a woman.

634
00:36:35,323 --> 00:36:37,583
I don't have any more trust to give you.

635
00:36:41,779 --> 00:36:45,212
So, I got the kids with
Margaret back at the house.

636
00:36:46,256 --> 00:36:47,642
What can I carry?

637
00:36:47,879 --> 00:36:48,905
This.

638
00:36:58,374 --> 00:36:59,589
Hang in there.

639
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:02,190
I got faith in you guys.

640
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,022
Sorry?

641
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,730
The wind turbine's working.

642
00:37:40,211 --> 00:37:41,938
Mrs. Hodges, how are you doing?

643
00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:44,787
- Not so hot.
- Let's get you checked out again.

644
00:37:45,356 --> 00:37:46,647
Dr. Dhuwalia.

645
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:53,802
Mrs. Hodges' cough is worse.
Her temperature is 102.

646
00:38:00,504 --> 00:38:03,409
- Hello, Mrs. Hodges.
- I'm Dr. Dhuwalia.

647
00:38:03,485 --> 00:38:05,669
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

648
00:38:06,254 --> 00:38:10,355
Why don't you go outside
and get a pan of boiling hot water

649
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:15,007
build a tent with a sheet. We need to
get this lady breathing some moist air.

650
00:38:16,452 --> 00:38:18,921
Take a deep breath.
There we go.

651
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:22,832
That was incredible!
Did you see the look on his face?

652
00:38:22,908 --> 00:38:24,750
I know, I thought he
was going to have a heart attack,

653
00:38:24,807 --> 00:38:26,823
and we were going to have
to drive him to the medical center.

654
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:31,077
I think we're going to be okay.

655
00:38:36,351 --> 00:38:37,585
Thanks for coming.

656
00:38:39,237 --> 00:38:40,775
I wanted to be there...

657
00:38:42,636 --> 00:38:43,794
with you.

658
00:38:52,377 --> 00:38:55,035
<i>You men are the only ones
who really know what's going on here.</i>

659
00:38:55,681 --> 00:38:58,884
When New Bern gets
their share of the spring crop,

660
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:02,778
you'll be allowed to return.
I know that sounds like a long time,

661
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:07,815
but what you are about to do
means this town's survival.

662
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,541
Now you've...

663
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:14,562
I know your families want some time
to say good-bye. So let's get going.

664
00:39:18,552 --> 00:39:20,261
Promise me something...

665
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,663
Promise you won't kill
Mimi while I'm gone.

666
00:39:27,746 --> 00:39:31,277
And you'll give her food.

667
00:39:32,602 --> 00:39:34,007
Why do you have to go?

668
00:39:34,593 --> 00:39:39,871
People are going to die if we
don't get these wind turbines...

669
00:39:42,905 --> 00:39:44,500
You're all have.

670
00:39:48,373 --> 00:39:49,854
I'll be back.

671
00:40:10,819 --> 00:40:12,262
Take care of Bonnie, okay?

672
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:15,752
Look, I just want to tell you something.

673
00:40:16,265 --> 00:40:18,866
- And don't freak out, okay?
- I won't.

674
00:40:21,106 --> 00:40:22,317
In this...

675
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:26,779
crazy world we don't know what's
going to happen tomorrow and...

676
00:40:27,064 --> 00:40:29,703
I don't wanna leave
anything unsaid, so...

677
00:40:29,836 --> 00:40:32,235
I'm just going to say it, okay?

678
00:40:32,433 --> 00:40:34,446
So here I go...

679
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,971
I've loved you since the
first day I saw you at Bailey's.

680
00:40:45,087 --> 00:40:47,575
You said it... you said it first.

681
00:40:50,001 --> 00:40:52,374
No one's ever said
it first to me before.

682
00:40:52,982 --> 00:40:55,125
I don't know what's going
to happen tomorrow, and...

683
00:40:56,551 --> 00:40:57,697
Plus,

684
00:40:58,969 --> 00:41:01,532
I can hold it over you
for the rest of our lives.

685
00:41:10,655 --> 00:41:12,516
I love you, Stanley Richmond.

686
00:41:15,592 --> 00:41:17,092
But I said it first.

687
00:41:32,096 --> 00:41:33,558
It wasn't your fault, Eric.

688
00:41:34,527 --> 00:41:35,894
You don't have to do this.

689
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,472
I can't be here right now.

690
00:41:43,187 --> 00:41:44,250
I can't.

691
00:42:00,661 --> 00:42:02,180
Take care, son.

692
00:42:14,317 --> 00:42:15,475
Be strong.

693
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,661
I'm...

694
00:42:37,459 --> 00:42:38,959
I'm sorry, Mom.

695
00:42:41,598 --> 00:42:43,231
We'll take care of Mary.

696
00:42:50,898 --> 00:42:52,455
All right, let's move out.

697
00:43:12,526 --> 00:43:14,083
My dad told me what's happening.

698
00:43:15,238 --> 00:43:18,428
First you're helping us, and now this...
What the hell's going on?

699
00:43:18,503 --> 00:43:20,753
They're going to be fine.
I'm going to look after them.

00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:23,031

701
00:43:24,108 --> 00:43:25,703
This isn't me.

702
00:43:25,837 --> 00:43:26,870
Where's Heather?

703
00:43:26,939 --> 00:43:30,034
She's fine. I told her we were making
the trip. She didn't want to come.

704
00:43:30,603 --> 00:43:31,609
Truth.

705
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:37,188
If anything happens to any of them,
you're the first one I come for.

706
00:43:40,738 --> 00:43:41,821
I know.
