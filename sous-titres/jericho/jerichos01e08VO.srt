1
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,920
--Jake...
--I see it.
--Slow down.

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,550
Not stopping until we get to Rogue River.

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,810
--You can't just leave her on the side of
the road like that.
--See that second set of skid marks back there?

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,810
Means someone forced her off the road
and probably robbed her and killed her.

5
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,280
For all we know, they could be waiting out there
to do it again.

6
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,110
I don't like it anymore than you do

7
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,030
but if we don't make it, Dad dies.

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,820
This is the world we live in now.

9
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:43,770
Oh.

10
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:45,170
Yes, it's ready.

11
00:00:45,572 --> 00:00:47,964
Oh, no, honey, watch out, sweetie.
It's hot.

12
00:00:48,397 --> 00:00:50,077
Wow, I can't believe it worked, Mom.

13
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:53,472
Yes, your father is a very smart man.

14
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:56,091
--Should I go get him?
--No, honey. He's working.

15
00:00:56,566 --> 00:00:58,560
Besides, this thing needs time to cool.

16
00:01:07,238 --> 00:01:07,852
Hello.

17
00:01:08,295 --> 00:01:11,770
Mrs. Hawkins, do you mind if we come
in for a few minutes?

18
00:01:19,615 --> 00:01:22,063
Hey, Gray Anderson and Jimmy are here to see you.

19
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:24,170
--They say about what?
--No.

20
00:01:24,178 --> 00:01:26,922
I mean, I didn't get the feeling it
was just a friendly house call.

21
00:01:27,717 --> 00:01:28,533
Okay.

22
00:01:40,328 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay.

23
00:01:41,488 --> 00:01:43,580
I got a route to the County Hospital in Rogue River.

24
00:01:43,586 --> 00:01:45,930
--Take Cedar Run Road...
--No good.

25
00:01:47,186 --> 00:01:49,070
You don't even know what I was going to say.

26
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:52,262
--Put the map away, we're taking the back roads.
--Jake, Dad's on borrowed time.

27
00:01:52,265 --> 00:01:55,721
--We need to get the medicine and get back here!
-- I spent most of my teenage years driving these roads.

28
00:01:55,727 --> 00:01:56,981
We'll make up the time.

29
00:01:57,507 --> 00:01:58,803
You always think you know better.

30
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,441
These things loaded?

31
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:02,181
Yes, it's loaded.

32
00:02:09,238 --> 00:02:10,922
What are we going to have to do, Jake?

33
00:02:12,448 --> 00:02:14,403
I don't know, but when it comes time to do it...

34
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:16,533
I'll be ready.

35
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:45,853
You haven't said anything for miles.
Stay sharp.

36
00:02:47,517 --> 00:02:48,623
What happened to you, Jake?

37
00:02:49,215 --> 00:02:50,931
--What do you mean?
--The last five years?

38
00:02:53,217 --> 00:02:54,232
Where were you?

39
00:02:56,627 --> 00:02:57,771
I'm assuming jail.

40
00:02:59,786 --> 00:03:01,743
--Why won't you tell me?
--Why does it matter?

41
00:03:02,525 --> 00:03:04,331
Because, all that time

42
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:07,111
I stood and I watched Mom and Dad suffer.

43
00:03:09,077 --> 00:03:11,573
Every time the phone rang,
they thought it was you.

44
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:15,821
I used to hate calling the house
because we sound the same on the phone.

45
00:03:16,765 --> 00:03:18,923
I couldn't listen to them
realizing it was only me.

46
00:03:19,045 --> 00:03:20,932
I'm sorry, all right?
I'm sorry

47
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:23,522
for what I did to our family

48
00:03:23,847 --> 00:03:26,822
but don't use me as an excuse
for not getting on with your life.

49
00:03:28,745 --> 00:03:30,033
What's that supposed to mean?

50
00:03:31,255 --> 00:03:33,912
You wouldn't be the first guy
to leave his wife, Eric.

51
00:03:37,735 --> 00:03:39,301
Look, I'm not telling you to leave her

52
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:41,340
--I'm just saying that...
-- You don't know what you're talking about, Jake.

53
00:03:41,658 --> 00:03:43,461
I'm talking about what you're afraid to say.

54
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,831
Life's too short.

55
00:03:49,415 --> 00:03:51,960
Well, don't worry about me.
Just drive.

56
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:05,781
--Thanks for talking with us, Robert.
--No problem, Gray.

57
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:08,450
What's this all about?

58
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:10,802
When I was in Topeka,

59
00:04:10,965 --> 00:04:16,132
people were saying that all of this could
be a first step in a foreign invasion,

60
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:22,253
except that getting all these bombs
into the country would be pretty difficult...

61
00:04:22,258 --> 00:04:23,933
Without help on the inside.

62
00:04:24,757 --> 00:04:25,773
Exactly.

63
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:32,861
I understand you and your family
moved to Jericho just before the attacks.

64
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:38,171
You bought your house in cash on a cop's salary.

65
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:42,800
--Am I under arrest for not taking on
a 30-year mortgage?
--No, of course not.

66
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:44,642
Well, if you wouldn't mind

67
00:04:44,788 --> 00:04:50,641
--my family and I were just about
to sit down to dinner.
--Actually, if you wouldn't mind humoring us,
for a couple more minutes.

68
00:04:50,756 --> 00:04:52,392
You know, since all of this happened

69
00:04:52,397 --> 00:04:56,570
we're all, I think, understandably curious
about anybody who's new in Jericho.

70
00:04:56,578 --> 00:04:58,803
Well, why don't you just ask me the question?

71
00:04:59,826 --> 00:05:05,353
You really think I was the mastermind behind the largest
terrorist attack in the history of the world?

72
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:07,822
Were you?

73
00:05:18,006 --> 00:05:21,143
Sorry... Listen, would you mind
if I just ask your family a few questions?

74
00:05:21,857 --> 00:05:22,832
That's funny.

75
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:27,493
You know, when I was a cop,

76
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:31,130
that is just the kind of thing
that I would say during an interrogation.

77
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:34,190
--Purely informational.
--And I would have said that, too, Gray.

78
00:05:41,957 --> 00:05:45,042
Well, Darcy's been wanting
to get to know the neighbors.

79
00:05:48,535 --> 00:05:49,321
Come on.

80
00:05:58,488 --> 00:06:00,611
How long can he hold on like this?

81
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:07,350
I can't say for sure.

82
00:06:09,678 --> 00:06:11,621
Maybe 12 hours.

83
00:06:12,295 --> 00:06:14,882
--12 hours?
--I am so sorry.

84
00:06:14,885 --> 00:06:19,852
I... I've been married to that man for a long time.

85
00:06:20,837 --> 00:06:23,623
I refuse to believe this is the way it ends.

86
00:06:33,298 --> 00:06:35,493
--Oh,  hey.
--Hey.

87
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:38,350
--I brought some food.
--Yeah. Come in.

88
00:06:38,686 --> 00:06:39,583
Gail's upstairs.

89
00:06:42,255 --> 00:06:45,930
I used to have this phobia of dairy products
that didn't need to be refrigerated.

90
00:06:47,238 --> 00:06:49,663
Now I think God for processed cheese food.

91
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:52,913
I brought soup-- creamy mushroom

92
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:56,753
--The only stuff I have left is what I had
for the food drive.
--I guess we're not the only ones.

93
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,391
How is he?

94
00:06:59,275 --> 00:07:00,370
He's getting worse.

95
00:07:00,927 --> 00:07:02,641
April doesn't think he has a lot of time.

96
00:07:04,686 --> 00:07:06,171
Oh, hi.

97
00:07:06,335 --> 00:07:08,603
I heard the door.
I thought it was the boys.

98
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:10,602
Heather brought some food.

99
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:12,110
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

100
00:07:12,195 --> 00:07:14,580
I'm so sorry about your husband, Mrs. Green.

101
00:07:16,347 --> 00:07:17,640
In this day and age,

102
00:07:18,626 --> 00:07:20,610
how can someone die of a fever?

103
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,791
It's the 21st century,
I can't get the right drugs.

104
00:07:24,188 --> 00:07:26,491
Can't even find ice to cool him off.

105
00:07:27,676 --> 00:07:28,920
I can make ice.

106
00:07:30,106 --> 00:07:34,211
I... one of the students had a project
in the science fair last year.

107
00:07:34,215 --> 00:07:36,772
I just need water and...

108
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:39,752
Do you have fertilizer?

109
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,140
Maybe. In the garage.

110
00:07:42,656 --> 00:07:46,351
Okay. I can do this... I think.

111
00:07:46,976 --> 00:07:48,343
Okay, let's try.

112
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:51,651
Okay. Grab every large bowl you have.

113
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:54,593
And can you get some buckets, and get
some fresh water from the well.

114
00:07:54,596 --> 00:07:55,491
It'll be cooler.

115
00:07:55,497 --> 00:07:56,570
I'll get the fertilizer.

116
00:07:56,616 --> 00:07:58,220
Buckets are in the laundry room.

117
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:36,551
Where is everybody?

118
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:39,491
Come on.
Let's get to the hospital.

119
00:08:56,066 --> 00:08:57,272
See those markings?

120
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,622
These homes were evacuated 10-25 by FEMA.

121
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:04,991
10-25-- that means they came through a
month after the bombs.

122
00:09:06,288 --> 00:09:09,572
Well, if FEMA was here, at least there's still
some sort of government.

123
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:10,710
As  of a week ago.

124
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,941
What  are the other numbers?

125
00:09:13,617 --> 00:09:16,430
The zero is the number they found alive.

126
00:09:17,526 --> 00:09:18,630
And the two?

127
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:20,183
The number of dead.

128
00:09:32,328 --> 00:09:34,721
We're going to go in, we're going to get the medicine,
and we're going to get out.

129
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:35,471
Okay.

130
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:44,391
"Federal Emergency Management Agency
has determined that

131
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:49,850
radioactive fallout from the blast in Lawrence,
Kansas has contaminated the water table of this region.

132
00:09:50,445 --> 00:09:54,240
"Under no circumstances should water
from any taps or wells be consumed. FEMA."

133
00:09:55,935 --> 00:09:58,672
Well, I guess that explains why
this place is empty.

134
00:09:59,106 --> 00:09:59,982
What the hell?!

135
00:10:00,277 --> 00:10:01,780
Where's that coming from?!

136
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:03,551
We got to get inside!

137
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:05,042
Stay close.

138
00:10:24,568 --> 00:10:26,651
Oh, my God.
What happened here?

139
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:27,901
You okay?

140
00:10:29,077 --> 00:10:29,941
Yeah.

141
00:10:30,136 --> 00:10:32,211
--Where do you think those shots came from?
--Top floor.

142
00:10:32,726 --> 00:10:33,943
Who the hell would be shooting at us?

143
00:10:33,945 --> 00:10:36,970
I don't know; if they have any Cipro,
it's probably upstairs.

144
00:10:59,552 --> 00:11:00,704
.556.

145
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,707
From an automatic weapon.

146
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:05,482
Maybe they belong to these guys.

147
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:11,611
--I didn't know Rogue River had a SWAT team.
--They don't.

148
00:11:11,848 --> 00:11:13,021
These guys aren't cops.

149
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:15,063
They're government contractors.

150
00:11:15,638 --> 00:11:19,580
A private army. A firm called Ravenwood.

151
00:11:19,905 --> 00:11:22,250
What are mercenaries doing in Kansas?

152
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:25,041
The same thing they've been
doing in Iraq and New Orleans.

153
00:11:25,237 --> 00:11:29,401
The military's been stretched so thin
the past few years, mercenaries became a commodity.

154
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,120
The real question is,

155
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:33,362
did they kill these people?

156
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:37,782
--Look, let's just get the drugs and go, okay?
--All right.

157
00:11:37,826 --> 00:11:39,513
--You ready?
--Yeah.

158
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:49,741
Nice job with the stove.

159
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,202
You burn the wood in the broiler-- right.

160
00:11:52,326 --> 00:11:56,672
Yeah. You know, we're just lucky
we had gas instead of an electric

161
00:11:56,677 --> 00:11:59,541
'cause it's got its own built-in vent.

162
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:00,693
Where's your brother?

163
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:04,621
How should I know?
I'm here with you.

164
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:07,013
Allison... manners.

165
00:12:07,445 --> 00:12:09,171
Let me know when dinner's back on.

166
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:14,240
Will you, um... just pardon me a moment?

167
00:12:15,616 --> 00:12:20,592
So, Darcy, why did you decide to move to Jericho?

168
00:12:22,317 --> 00:12:23,103
Hey.

169
00:12:23,558 --> 00:12:24,811
I don't like that guy.

170
00:12:26,808 --> 00:12:30,482
I need you to do something for me, okay?

171
00:12:47,996 --> 00:12:51,633
The ammonium nitrate in fertilizer
extracts the heat from the water.

172
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:54,823
--How long is this supposed to take?
--I think a while.

173
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:58,811
I'm going to go up and check on him.

174
00:13:00,507 --> 00:13:02,791
God, I hope I'm not screwing this up.

175
00:13:03,077 --> 00:13:04,710
She's been up for 24 hours.

176
00:13:05,738 --> 00:13:07,970
They've been married for 40 years.

177
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:09,813
Can you imagine?

178
00:13:11,117 --> 00:13:12,900
I'm was supposed to be married tomorrow.

179
00:13:13,848 --> 00:13:15,292
Hey, hey.

180
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:17,251
Roger's coming back.

181
00:13:18,707 --> 00:13:19,841
So'Jake.

182
00:13:25,477 --> 00:13:26,801
All right, stay close to the wall.

183
00:13:31,655 --> 00:13:32,753
Come on. Come here.

184
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:40,242
Look, if something happens to me, get
in the car and go.

185
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:41,581
All right? Find another town.

186
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,462
Search house to house, if you have to.

187
00:13:43,465 --> 00:13:45,463
Jake, nothing is going to happen to you.

188
00:13:45,635 --> 00:13:47,852
Okay? Nothing ever does.

189
00:13:48,797 --> 00:13:50,510
Go! Go! Move!

190
00:13:55,687 --> 00:13:57,600
You went to Crow Island School.

191
00:13:58,425 --> 00:14:00,423
We moved here after our grandfather died.

192
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,633
--Sam, are you listening?
--I'm hungry. I want dinner.

193
00:14:04,997 --> 00:14:06,470
Oh, God...

194
00:14:07,428 --> 00:14:08,411
You know what, Sam?

195
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:10,093
You should tell that to the guys in there.

196
00:14:10,097 --> 00:14:12,530
Just keep saying it as much
as you can, okay.

197
00:14:15,325 --> 00:14:18,702
--Hey, pal, what you drawing?
--My old house.

198
00:14:18,707 --> 00:14:19,643
Oh, yeah?

199
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,930
Well, where is that?

200
00:14:24,357 --> 00:14:25,762
I'm hungry.

201
00:14:26,117 --> 00:14:28,850
Well, you know what, as soon
as we're finished talking

202
00:14:28,858 --> 00:14:31,362
--maybe your mom will give you some of that pie.
--I want it now.

203
00:14:31,725 --> 00:14:33,950
--Well, in a few...
--Now. I'm hungry.

204
00:14:34,938 --> 00:14:38,072
--He gets a little cranky when he's hungry.
--Yeah, I see that.

205
00:14:38,698 --> 00:14:41,961
--You mind if we get him something to eat?
--No, no, of course not.

206
00:14:43,768 --> 00:14:45,722
I'll take him to the kitchen.
Come on, Sam.

207
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:49,950
Would you mind hanging out for a couple minutes?

208
00:14:53,286 --> 00:14:54,113
Whatever.

209
00:14:56,415 --> 00:14:57,072
Sam.

210
00:14:57,936 --> 00:14:59,231
See ya, buddy.

211
00:15:05,176 --> 00:15:06,503
You okay?

212
00:15:08,385 --> 00:15:09,573
You say something?

213
00:15:10,558 --> 00:15:11,811
All I hear is ringing.

214
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,852
It'll pass in a minute.

215
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:18,892
--You down there, freeze! Drop your weapons!
--No.

216
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:21,160
We're here for medicine.

217
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:23,322
It's an emergency.
We don't want trouble.

218
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:25,631
There's no medicine here.

219
00:15:25,798 --> 00:15:27,641
We want to look for ourselves.

220
00:15:30,116 --> 00:15:31,523
We can trade you for food.

221
00:15:32,117 --> 00:15:34,182
We have everything we need.
Go away.

222
00:15:38,617 --> 00:15:40,321
--Jake...
--What?

223
00:15:40,327 --> 00:15:41,611
What, are you crazy?

224
00:15:41,797 --> 00:15:43,242
Didn't you hear him? He's scared.

225
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:46,803
He threw a grenade. That was a flash-bang,
not a grenade.

226
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:48,961
It's just loud and bright to scare us.

227
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:51,203
If he'd wanted to kill us, he would have.

228
00:16:07,587 --> 00:16:09,510
Putting our weapons down and coming up.

229
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:12,012
You come up and I'll shoot you.

230
00:16:12,928 --> 00:16:14,560
All right, just take it easy.

231
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:29,930
That's far enough.

232
00:16:43,617 --> 00:16:44,550
Gail...

233
00:16:46,037 --> 00:16:47,872
Oh, it's me, April.

234
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:51,361
Gail's downstairs.

235
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:53,323
She'll be up soon.

236
00:16:59,506 --> 00:17:01,811
I wish there was something more I could do.

237
00:17:03,307 --> 00:17:04,401
But there isn't.

238
00:17:06,207 --> 00:17:08,202
Please just hold on a little longer.

239
00:17:11,575 --> 00:17:13,220
Can I tell you a secret?

240
00:17:17,325 --> 00:17:19,831
You are going to be a grandfather.

241
00:17:23,837 --> 00:17:25,560
I haven't told anyone yet.

242
00:17:26,976 --> 00:17:27,963
Not even Eric.

243
00:17:29,665 --> 00:17:31,503
I don't know what he's going to say.

244
00:17:34,526 --> 00:17:37,032
But this child needs a grandpa.

245
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:43,032
Hold on, okay?

246
00:17:44,058 --> 00:17:45,030
Please.

247
00:18:16,358 --> 00:18:17,563
You're with Ravenwood.

248
00:18:19,218 --> 00:18:20,023
How do you know?

249
00:18:22,606 --> 00:18:24,562
I spent a year and a half in the Green Zone

250
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:27,621
running a supply rig up and down
Route Irish to BIAP.

251
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:30,483
You were in Iraq?

252
00:18:31,185 --> 00:18:35,081
--Soldier?
--No, I just drove a truck for another contractor

253
00:18:35,088 --> 00:18:36,961
but I met a lot of Ravenwood guys.

254
00:18:40,646 --> 00:18:41,812
Where were you?

255
00:18:43,385 --> 00:18:44,441
Fallujah.

256
00:18:46,057 --> 00:18:47,811
Man, I thought I had it bad.

257
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:52,082
I thought it was the worst thing
I'd ever lived through...

258
00:18:52,635 --> 00:18:53,422
till  now.

259
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:01,500
You mind putting that thing down?

260
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:04,853
I'm just here for medicine.
We don't have a lot of time.

261
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:08,821
This is my brother Eric. I'm Jake.

262
00:19:12,078 --> 00:19:12,971
Come on.

263
00:19:20,106 --> 00:19:21,241
Randy Payton.

264
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:32,560
I'll take you to see the doc.

265
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:36,420
You're in, uh...

266
00:19:37,295 --> 00:19:38,662
you're in pretty bad shape.

267
00:19:39,448 --> 00:19:42,540
Morphine and instant coffee are the only things
keeping me standing right now.

268
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:45,372
What are you doing in Kansas?

269
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,170
Not enough National Guard.

270
00:19:48,275 --> 00:19:49,841
Homeland Security hired us.

271
00:19:50,506 --> 00:19:52,751
Brought us in to protect
the governor of Nebraska.

272
00:19:52,756 --> 00:19:55,103
Wait, the governor's alive?

273
00:19:55,948 --> 00:19:56,923
Don't know.

274
00:19:57,868 --> 00:19:58,731
When we landed,

275
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,822
they brought us over here to help FEMA
evacuate Rogue River.

276
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:02,882
Where to?

277
00:20:04,018 --> 00:20:08,360
FEMA  set up a tent city in a Wal-Mart parking lot.

278
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:10,013
A few miles north of here.

279
00:20:12,968 --> 00:20:14,291
What happened to these people?

280
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:19,352
These are the ones that couldn't be moved.

281
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:22,412
Too old...

282
00:20:24,918 --> 00:20:25,853
too sick.

283
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:28,830
So you just killed them?

284
00:20:29,655 --> 00:20:31,413
No, not me.

285
00:20:32,088 --> 00:20:33,412
We tried to move them.

286
00:20:33,805 --> 00:20:35,291
But the doctors wouldn't allow it.

287
00:20:36,438 --> 00:20:37,962
There were so many of them.

288
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,501
Crying out, begging.

289
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:42,241
The guys, they just wanted to come in

290
00:20:42,245 --> 00:20:44,352
and they just wanted to take the medicine
and they wanted to leave

291
00:20:44,356 --> 00:20:47,230
but the doctors started arguing with them

292
00:20:47,235 --> 00:20:49,550
and then, one of our guys, he...

293
00:20:50,887 --> 00:20:51,900
he just snapped.

294
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:54,090
He started firing.

295
00:20:54,528 --> 00:20:57,232
Before I knew it, they all emptied their weapons.

296
00:20:58,448 --> 00:20:59,973
Why didn't you stop them?

297
00:21:00,756 --> 00:21:02,531
How do you think I got shot?

298
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:07,181
They left me for dead with everybody else.

299
00:21:24,127 --> 00:21:25,381
There's the doc.

300
00:21:25,386 --> 00:21:27,383
When I came to, he was working on me.

301
00:21:27,657 --> 00:21:29,181
Patched me up as best he could.

302
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:31,653
Been trying to save everybody else since then.

303
00:21:34,715 --> 00:21:36,253
I need more bloody light.

304
00:21:36,606 --> 00:21:38,402
--Doc?
--Yeah?

305
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:39,973
This is Jake and Eric.

306
00:21:40,337 --> 00:21:41,582
And they need medicine.

307
00:21:41,976 --> 00:21:45,302
Dr. Kenchy Dhuwalia.
Forgive me if I don't shake your hand.

308
00:21:50,196 --> 00:21:51,371
I need Cipro.

309
00:21:54,685 --> 00:21:55,363
Right.

310
00:21:56,426 --> 00:21:58,501
Morphine's worth a lot more, you know?

311
00:21:58,505 --> 00:22:01,120
Hey, I'm not selling it, all right?
I need it now.

312
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,490
It's for my father.

313
00:22:20,186 --> 00:22:21,400
It's Ravenwood.

314
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:23,920
They're back.

315
00:22:28,105 --> 00:22:29,590
There are six or eight of them.

316
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:32,063
They brought a truck.

317
00:22:32,536 --> 00:22:34,262
They're gonna clean out the hospital.

318
00:22:35,017 --> 00:22:38,262
Medicine, supplies, anything that's not nailed down.

319
00:22:42,298 --> 00:22:45,070
And they're gonna kill anybody they find alive.

320
00:22:46,176 --> 00:22:47,390
We know what they did.

321
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,583
We can't let them get inside.

322
00:22:51,498 --> 00:22:53,023
Hey! Hey!

323
00:22:59,105 --> 00:23:00,163
One down.

324
00:23:01,107 --> 00:23:03,841
--What about a back exit?
--It's barricaded.

325
00:23:04,206 --> 00:23:06,630
You want to live, stand up and fight.

326
00:23:12,436 --> 00:23:15,141
Well, that's when my grandma died
and left everything to my parents.

327
00:23:15,497 --> 00:23:18,510
They wanted me out of the school
I was in, so... we moved.

328
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:24,671
--Was your father away from home
a lot when you were a kid?
--Of course. He's a cop.

329
00:23:25,106 --> 00:23:29,563
Mm. Did he bring friends around, anybody
you thought was kind of strange?

330
00:23:29,806 --> 00:23:31,722
His friends are all cops.

331
00:23:34,215 --> 00:23:35,113
What about money?

332
00:23:35,505 --> 00:23:38,523
--Did your parents ever argue over money?
--Doesn't everyone's?

333
00:23:38,525 --> 00:23:40,052
No, I-I'm thinking...

334
00:23:40,338 --> 00:23:43,111
you know, about the sudden windfall.

335
00:23:43,406 --> 00:23:45,253
--Like my Grandma's inheritance?
--Right.

336
00:23:45,256 --> 00:23:46,642
When was that again?

337
00:23:47,758 --> 00:23:51,312
What-what, are you stupid?
I already told you, six months ago.

338
00:23:51,595 --> 00:23:53,070
Don't be disrespectful, Allison.

339
00:23:53,077 --> 00:23:56,881
Dad, this is bull-- he's in our house
acting like we're criminals or something.

340
00:23:58,526 --> 00:24:01,971
--Are you harassing everyone in
town or just the black people?
-- That's enough

341
00:24:02,325 --> 00:24:05,861
--Why are you letting him do this?
--Look, I apologize, Mr. Anderson.

342
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:08,950
--You're  apologizing to him?
--Yes, and so will you.

343
00:24:08,955 --> 00:24:11,611
--Oh-ho, forget that. I'm not sorry.
--Apologize.

344
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,173
Dad, he's a racist!

345
00:24:13,496 --> 00:24:16,663
I hate this stupid town--
I wish we never moved!

346
00:24:25,586 --> 00:24:26,642
They're coming in.

347
00:24:26,926 --> 00:24:28,053
Why weren't they shooting?

348
00:24:28,057 --> 00:24:30,271
Ammo's in short supply-- they're
gonna wait to fight in close.

349
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:32,630
--Take some of these clips.
--They're all empty.

350
00:24:32,867 --> 00:24:35,611
Look, we got to get the medication
and get out of here. Doc!

351
00:24:35,615 --> 00:24:36,861
Where's the Cipro?

352
00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:38,881
--Where's the Cipro!
--On the shelf.

353
00:24:38,938 --> 00:24:39,993
They're gonna come straight for us.

354
00:24:39,996 --> 00:24:42,722
We got to hide, let 'em pass,
then we can slip out.

355
00:24:43,498 --> 00:24:44,832
I couldn't even save one.

356
00:24:45,207 --> 00:24:46,111
Not even one!

357
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:48,382
Doc, we got to go or we're gonna be dead, too.

358
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:52,213
--I got it, I got it!
--Come on!

359
00:24:57,977 --> 00:24:59,653
My girl's been through a lot.

360
00:25:00,658 --> 00:25:05,713
--But I raised her better than that.
--I want to assure you, Mr. Hawkins,
that this is not about color.

361
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:10,210
Black, white or otherwise, my only objective
is to protect the people of Jericho.

362
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:12,963
I got a boy about the same age.

363
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:16,061
You should bring yours over sometime-- Samuel
could use a playmate.

364
00:25:16,065 --> 00:25:19,082
Would you mind if Jimmy has a quick look
around the house while we talk?

365
00:25:20,855 --> 00:25:21,590
Excuse me?

366
00:25:22,065 --> 00:25:23,941
Just a question of being thorough.

367
00:25:25,017 --> 00:25:28,693
And is... searching houses standard policy here?

368
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:32,712
I thought this was... Kansas, not Soviet Russia.

369
00:25:33,145 --> 00:25:36,090
You know, we been pretty easy-going about all this.

370
00:25:36,138 --> 00:25:40,213
And I'm only asking for a little more
patience so I know I can vouch for you.

371
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:43,620
Unless... you're afraid
there's something we'll find.

372
00:25:47,668 --> 00:25:51,500
You know, if you can overlook the mess...

373
00:25:52,136 --> 00:25:55,143
...we can overlook the violation of our civil rights.

374
00:25:57,568 --> 00:25:58,430
Um...

375
00:25:58,636 --> 00:26:00,700
I'll just take a quick peek around, and...

376
00:26:01,178 --> 00:26:02,983
then we'll be on our way.

377
00:26:33,487 --> 00:26:34,392
Come on, let's go.

378
00:26:35,807 --> 00:26:37,912
What do you say we wait
till they leave the building?

379
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:40,260
That could take hours--
Dad doesn't have hours.

380
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:41,353
What's wrong with him?

381
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:43,822
He's gone into septic shock.

382
00:26:44,656 --> 00:26:47,623
Sepsis? You have to go back.

383
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:49,193
What are you talking about?

384
00:26:49,468 --> 00:26:52,091
If your father's in septic shock,
that means his organs are shutting down.

385
00:26:52,098 --> 00:26:53,772
That means that by the time
you get to him

386
00:26:53,775 --> 00:26:56,131
his body won't even be able
to process the Cipro.

387
00:26:56,136 --> 00:26:58,282
You need an intravenous drug.

388
00:26:58,286 --> 00:26:59,463
It's called Levaquin.

389
00:26:59,757 --> 00:27:01,910
--It's back in the ICU.
--What's it look like?

390
00:27:02,076 --> 00:27:04,603
It's a clear bottle, purple label.

391
00:27:04,605 --> 00:27:07,811
--You'll need syringes.
--Jake, this is nuts. We can't go back there.

392
00:27:07,816 --> 00:27:09,610
Well, we can't take the chance we have
the wrong medicine.

393
00:27:09,616 --> 00:27:12,042
--What, we gonna shoot our way through?
--Yeah, if I have to.

394
00:27:13,456 --> 00:27:14,511
I'm with you.

395
00:27:17,606 --> 00:27:19,012
Are you with me or not?

396
00:27:29,755 --> 00:27:30,543
Okay.

397
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:34,152
--But we need a plan.
--All right.

398
00:27:41,595 --> 00:27:43,161
This is definitely taking too long.

399
00:27:43,165 --> 00:27:44,412
Like the water should be freezing by now.

400
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:47,880
You know, let's just dump these and start over.
--Okay, shouldn't we wait till we figure out
what we've done wrong?

401
00:27:47,887 --> 00:27:49,721
No. This is all we have.

402
00:27:50,138 --> 00:27:51,673
The mayor's running out of time.

403
00:27:51,676 --> 00:27:52,800
We got to cool him down.

404
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,901
Everybody's counting on me,
and it's not working.

405
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,981
Yeah, but we have to give it time to work.

406
00:27:56,985 --> 00:27:58,433
Okay, you're freaking out!

407
00:28:01,527 --> 00:28:02,503
This one's cold.

408
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:04,360
It's working.

409
00:28:05,577 --> 00:28:07,533
What did you do differently with this one?

410
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:12,270
The... the bowl-- it's aluminum.

411
00:28:12,606 --> 00:28:17,362
--God, plastic's an insulator-- I'm so stupid.
--So we just need more of these, right?
--Yeah.

412
00:28:17,568 --> 00:28:21,143
--Anything metal-- pie tins, anything.
--All right, I'll get 'em from the kitchen.
--Okay.

413
00:28:21,395 --> 00:28:22,662
We got ice!

414
00:28:29,815 --> 00:28:30,793
Don't shoot.

415
00:28:32,676 --> 00:28:35,453
I'm a doctor. I'm unarmed.

416
00:28:35,657 --> 00:28:36,881
On your knees.

417
00:28:39,107 --> 00:28:40,002
Who are you?

418
00:28:45,195 --> 00:28:47,142
I can help your friend.

419
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:00,810
What's your name?

420
00:29:03,095 --> 00:29:04,410
What's your name?

421
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:07,040
--Don't make me ask you again.
--Eric.

422
00:29:07,756 --> 00:29:09,862
Eric Green. I'm a doctor.

423
00:29:10,587 --> 00:29:12,180
The Red Cross brought me here.

424
00:29:12,627 --> 00:29:13,871
To shoot at me?

425
00:29:14,937 --> 00:29:18,280
--That wasn't me.
--Who was it?
The guys in that muscle car?

426
00:29:19,397 --> 00:29:20,921
I don't know what you're talking about.

427
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:22,961
Where are they?

428
00:29:26,528 --> 00:29:27,701
Where are they?

429
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,960
They're in the therapy room downstairs.

430
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:37,373
There's, uh, three or four of them.

431
00:29:39,255 --> 00:29:40,231
Get 'em.

432
00:29:53,007 --> 00:29:54,570
Your man lost a lot of blood.

433
00:29:55,437 --> 00:29:56,801
I can help him.

434
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:00,920
Get up.

435
00:30:09,528 --> 00:30:10,341
Fire in the hole!

436
00:30:13,406 --> 00:30:14,150
Clear left.

437
00:30:14,535 --> 00:30:15,401
Clear right.

438
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:18,241
Room's empty. Move out.

439
00:30:24,277 --> 00:30:26,080
All right, we need something to cut his shirt.

440
00:30:26,947 --> 00:30:29,170
Uh, s-something sterile.

441
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:45,291
Hey, what are you doing?

442
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:48,271
I'm... I'm just getting something for the pain.

443
00:30:48,706 --> 00:30:50,310
He can handle the pain.

444
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,493
Just get to work.

445
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:48,782
You people drafted my husband
into your police force

446
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:50,642
and now you're suspecting him
of being a criminal.

447
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:53,122
We're not suspecting anything.

448
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:56,492
--We just want to know...
--Yeah.
"Who's in your town."

449
00:31:56,495 --> 00:31:57,483
Yeah, I heard.

450
00:31:58,978 --> 00:32:03,491
This has been unpleasant for all of us.
Some more than others.

451
00:32:07,646 --> 00:32:08,863
I found something.

452
00:32:36,438 --> 00:32:37,451
Darcy.

453
00:32:38,545 --> 00:32:40,863
I'm gonna need a minute alone with Mr. Anderson.

454
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:02,082
Payton, let's go! Go on! Come on!

455
00:33:02,086 --> 00:33:03,652
Car's out front. Go!

456
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,962
No. This is on me.

457
00:33:06,165 --> 00:33:09,011
--Payton. They'll kill you. Come on.
--I don 't care.

458
00:33:09,206 --> 00:33:10,580
I deserve this.

459
00:33:11,927 --> 00:33:13,533
I emptied my gun up there, too.

460
00:33:14,907 --> 00:33:16,851
Go. Let me do this.

461
00:33:26,107 --> 00:33:27,661
Come on! Go!

462
00:33:27,728 --> 00:33:29,911
--Where's Payton?
--He's not coming.

463
00:33:41,596 --> 00:33:44,731
Why didn't you just tell me
you were a federal agent?

464
00:33:48,517 --> 00:33:50,820
How do you even know that that badge is real?

465
00:33:53,727 --> 00:33:54,983
I guess...

466
00:33:55,768 --> 00:33:56,981
I don't.

467
00:33:59,608 --> 00:34:01,802
The fakes are usually made of aluminum.

468
00:34:02,896 --> 00:34:05,130
It's cheaper. Lighter.

469
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:07,052
If it's heavy...

470
00:34:09,476 --> 00:34:10,921
...that's how you know.

471
00:34:11,786 --> 00:34:15,543
Don't just assume that because somebody has
one of these that it is real

472
00:34:15,546 --> 00:34:17,152
especially not these days.

473
00:34:17,758 --> 00:34:20,411
--But why didn't you say anything?
--Because I don't know you.

474
00:34:21,296 --> 00:34:23,242
I don't know who I can trust.

475
00:34:24,346 --> 00:34:26,813
You see, the bureau was tracking some
suspicious contacts

476
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:30,923
between unknown people
in this area of Kansas and...

477
00:34:32,456 --> 00:34:33,901
terrorist groups abroad.

478
00:34:34,147 --> 00:34:35,402
What kind of contacts?

479
00:34:35,697 --> 00:34:36,950
Pay phone calls.

480
00:34:37,907 --> 00:34:39,242
Money transfers.

481
00:34:40,696 --> 00:34:44,500
You know, I was relocated to investigate
undercover, Mr. Anderson.

482
00:34:44,818 --> 00:34:45,902
and as far as I'm concerned

483
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:47,823
I am still on the job, so...

484
00:34:48,146 --> 00:34:51,972
--I would appreciate your discretion.
--No, of course. Jimmy's the only one who knows.

485
00:34:51,977 --> 00:34:54,242
--I'll make sure it stays that way.
--Good.

486
00:34:57,557 --> 00:35:01,950
The people who did this, they will try
to hit us again.

487
00:35:03,638 --> 00:35:05,011
We can't let that happen.

488
00:35:05,778 --> 00:35:09,653
But from now on, we keep an open line
with one another.

489
00:35:10,438 --> 00:35:11,533
Okay, then.

490
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:21,212
Man, it's been a long day.

491
00:35:22,585 --> 00:35:23,521
If you don't mind...

492
00:35:25,347 --> 00:35:27,230
I'm just happy to have you on the team, Mr. Hawkins.

493
00:35:27,235 --> 00:35:29,621
I'm very sorry for the intrusion.

494
00:35:29,855 --> 00:35:31,891
You do not have to apologize for anything.

495
00:35:32,537 --> 00:35:33,713
You did good work.

496
00:35:51,345 --> 00:35:52,120
Is he?

497
00:35:52,225 --> 00:35:53,672
Barely. Just hurry.

498
00:35:57,158 --> 00:35:59,592
--Okay, let's go.
--April...

499
00:36:00,188 --> 00:36:02,761
--This is Dr. Kenchy.
--April Green.

500
00:36:02,767 --> 00:36:03,653
Did you get the Cipro?

501
00:36:05,945 --> 00:36:07,311
This is Levaquin.

502
00:36:07,636 --> 00:36:09,820
It will go directly into his system.

503
00:36:09,938 --> 00:36:12,052
--Are we on time?
--Well...

504
00:36:12,188 --> 00:36:13,943
if his body is strong enough,

505
00:36:14,348 --> 00:36:15,823
we will know by morning.

506
00:36:17,045 --> 00:36:18,142
He's strong enough.

507
00:36:29,677 --> 00:36:31,082
You're gonna be all right, Dad.

508
00:36:32,418 --> 00:36:33,980
You're going to be okay, sweetheart.

509
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:53,870
It's a nice job.

510
00:36:55,425 --> 00:36:56,402
Got the key?

511
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:02,541
Thank you.

512
00:37:07,627 --> 00:37:09,111
I know you're one of the good guys.

513
00:37:19,307 --> 00:37:22,873
--Thanks for staying with my mom.
--Glad to help.

514
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,353
She's being humble.

515
00:37:25,748 --> 00:37:27,202
She saved your father's life.

516
00:37:31,398 --> 00:37:33,032
Well, you guys get some sleep.

517
00:37:40,597 --> 00:37:41,963
What did you see out there?

518
00:37:46,805 --> 00:37:47,661
Another time.

519
00:37:51,496 --> 00:37:52,392
Good night.

520
00:37:54,276 --> 00:37:55,210
Good night.

521
00:38:12,096 --> 00:38:15,541
--What's all this stuff?
--I don't know.

522
00:38:17,305 --> 00:38:18,360
How you feeling?

523
00:38:23,656 --> 00:38:24,670
Honestly...

524
00:38:26,988 --> 00:38:27,961
Couldn't tell you.

525
00:38:33,027 --> 00:38:34,043
You'll be okay.

526
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:36,903
All right?

527
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:42,151
You'll get through this.

528
00:38:42,478 --> 00:38:44,662
You're a much better person than I am, so...

529
00:38:45,578 --> 00:38:46,910
I know you'll be fine.

530
00:38:50,946 --> 00:38:52,880
I don't know if I'm a better person.

531
00:39:03,078 --> 00:39:04,552
I'm in love with Mary Bailey.

532
00:39:07,395 --> 00:39:08,681
You knew that, didn't you?

533
00:39:14,987 --> 00:39:16,121
I'm gonna tell April.

534
00:39:18,877 --> 00:39:20,431
Life's too short, right?

535
00:39:21,847 --> 00:39:24,313
Whatever you do, I'm sure
it'll be the right thing.

536
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:28,752
Let's get some rest.

537
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:46,600
Where's my jacket?

538
00:39:49,106 --> 00:39:50,880
I don't know. Did you leave it in the car?

539
00:39:53,505 --> 00:39:55,531
Jake, I left my jacket back there--

540
00:39:55,868 --> 00:39:58,493
the wallet is in the jacket-- the address.

541
00:39:58,498 --> 00:40:02,320
--What if those guys come here?
--Those guys are dead, all right?
Payton took care of it.

542
00:40:02,606 --> 00:40:03,501
Don't worry.

543
00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:07,382
--I'm sorry I screwed up.
--You did great out there today.

544
00:40:08,756 --> 00:40:10,822
Get some sleep, we'll worry about it tomorrow.

545
00:40:17,387 --> 00:40:19,762
--Good night.
--Good night.

546
00:40:31,316 --> 00:40:32,651
Good. See to that.

547
00:40:33,396 --> 00:40:35,823
Mount up, boys! We're moving out!

548
00:40:44,138 --> 00:40:45,381
Jericho.
