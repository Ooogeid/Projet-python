1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
Previously on Jericho:

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,910
All right, it looks like the explosion
came from the west, maybe Denver.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:07,440
If it was an attack,
and there is chaos out there,

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,430
you might not want the wrong people
knowing that Jericho is still here.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,120
Oh, my God, we got something.

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,150
- Was that Korean?
- I think it was Chinese.
- Mandarin.

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,750
Question is: Were they just
reporting it or are they behind it?

8
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,020
The last time I saw you,
you were going to tell your wife about us

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,670
and we were going to
start our life together.

10
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:24,930
I wake up in the morning and I
want it to be you there so badly.

11
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:28,470
It hasn't been a particularly good morning,
if you know what I mean?

12
00:00:28,526 --> 00:00:32,205
Of course, it could be the nerves
as much as the pregnancy.

13
00:00:32,202 --> 00:00:34,318
You didn't tell Eric about the baby?

14
00:00:34,499 --> 00:00:38,651
Everyone that I ever cared about
was incinerated four weeks ago.

15
00:00:39,317 --> 00:00:41,411
And you're gonna tell me
that you know how I feel?

16
00:00:43,945 --> 00:00:47,201
- I'm trying to be nice to you.
- Well stop being nice to me!

17
00:00:48,196 --> 00:00:49,040
Hello, Jonah.

18
00:00:49,145 --> 00:00:51,981
The guy did four years at Lansing
for extortion and assault,

19
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,941
and you want to negotiate with that guy?

20
00:00:53,946 --> 00:00:56,311
I've seen what happens when people lose
their hold on law and order--

21
00:00:56,317 --> 00:00:59,691
you start striking bargains with the
bad guys, it's the beginning of the end.

22
00:00:59,697 --> 00:01:00,773
Why are you talking to him?

23
00:01:00,896 --> 00:01:03,180
It's okay, all right? It didn't
have anything to do with you.

24
00:01:03,326 --> 00:01:06,513
He's my father--
it has everything to do with me.

25
00:01:07,556 --> 00:01:08,750
We need a security force.

26
00:01:09,105 --> 00:01:12,411
A real one, trained.
Sanctioned, by you.

27
00:01:12,608 --> 00:01:14,201
Make sure you do it right.

28
00:02:14,776 --> 00:02:15,631
Darn it!

29
00:02:19,358 --> 00:02:20,762
I really thought I had that one.

30
00:02:22,115 --> 00:02:23,270
Well, we'll get 'em next time.

31
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:24,772
Let's get back on patrol.

32
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:31,141
- He's trying hard.
They all are.
- Trying?

33
00:02:31,578 --> 00:02:32,810
This isn't a drill.

34
00:02:33,268 --> 00:02:36,753
If he can't hit a turkey with
a shotgun, what happens
when his target shoots back?

35
00:02:37,668 --> 00:02:40,231
- They really invited you on a turkey shoot?
- Mmmm.

36
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:42,882
- What'd you say?
- I declined politely.

37
00:02:43,358 --> 00:02:44,942
I don't care if it is Thanksgiving.

38
00:02:45,827 --> 00:02:47,133
Be nice to have a real turkey.

39
00:02:48,107 --> 00:02:53,121
- Well, you know, if I shot it,
you would have to clean it.
- Yeah, good point.

40
00:02:54,735 --> 00:02:56,050
Hey, what about you guys?

41
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:59,053
You gonna be crushed not
to have a turkey this year?

42
00:02:59,835 --> 00:03:01,111
I'm a vegetarian.

43
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:03,250
Right.

44
00:03:04,547 --> 00:03:07,771
- Well, we'll have plenty for you.
- There's not "plenty" of anything.

45
00:03:08,446 --> 00:03:09,232
We'll make do.

46
00:03:10,207 --> 00:03:12,803
- I'm just glad you're gonna be here.
- Hey, me, too.

47
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:15,771
How come you missed all
the other Thanksgivings?

48
00:03:16,475 --> 00:03:18,743
- Was business trips.
- On Thanksgiving?

49
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:20,771
Well, you know...

50
00:03:21,865 --> 00:03:24,142
it wasn't a big holiday
where Daddy was working.

51
00:03:24,148 --> 00:03:26,322
Those days are over, son, okay?

52
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:36,663
Thank you.

53
00:03:36,856 --> 00:03:39,032
- Hey.
- Hi.

54
00:03:39,698 --> 00:03:42,150
Oh, you sure you want to donate all at?

55
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:44,090
A lot of folks need it more than I do.

56
00:03:44,555 --> 00:03:47,471
Some of my students are so skinny
I barely recognize them.

57
00:03:47,737 --> 00:03:49,600
- Where'd you find it?
- The garage.

58
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,931
Roger was such a planner,
you'd think we already had five kids.

59
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:54,852
- You want to have five kids?
- He wanted five kids.

60
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,693
I said I was good for two,
and after that he was on his own.

61
00:03:58,757 --> 00:04:01,910
Emily, I don't quite know what I'm
serving for Thanksgiving this year

62
00:04:01,915 --> 00:04:04,633
but always know that you're
welcome at our table, honey.

63
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:07,873
Thanks, I usually go to my aunt's.

64
00:04:09,277 --> 00:04:13,681
- Do you guys still have that football
game before dinner?
- Of course.

65
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:16,260
There are some things the
apocalypse can't change.

66
00:04:17,287 --> 00:04:20,543
- How's your throwing arm?
- Still better than Jake's.

67
00:04:24,318 --> 00:04:29,093
- Oh, Gray's finally getting that
election, huh? - Yeah, next week.

68
00:04:31,677 --> 00:04:32,843
Is the mayor nervous?

69
00:04:33,515 --> 00:04:35,060
Not as nervous as he should be.

70
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:43,760
- How long do think it'll take us to
train our guys? - Oh, weeks at best.

71
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:49,592
Look at us-- for every cop and veteran,
we've got an accountant or travel agent,
or a farmer.

72
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:50,850
Watch it, buddy.

73
00:04:51,816 --> 00:04:53,362
Think Ravenwood will be back?

74
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:55,463
When they run out of towns, yeah.

75
00:04:56,126 --> 00:04:57,711
Questions is, how long...

76
00:05:07,277 --> 00:05:08,703
Must have scared them off.

77
00:05:11,547 --> 00:05:12,431
Whoa.

78
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:13,993
What the...?

79
00:05:14,975 --> 00:05:16,870
Those are the first planes
I've seen since the bombs.

80
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,892
But not the last.

81
00:05:26,446 --> 00:05:29,553
- What is that?
- It sounds like bombers.

82
00:05:29,868 --> 00:05:31,450
Darcy, come on. Everybody.

83
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,121
I want everybody into the
basement until they pass.

84
00:05:34,206 --> 00:05:37,971
- And, hey. Listen, I have got to...
- Okay, go. Go.

85
00:05:53,715 --> 00:05:54,760
What the hell's going on?

86
00:05:55,017 --> 00:05:55,981
What are they dropping?

87
00:05:57,428 --> 00:05:58,663
God only knows.

88
00:06:40,326 --> 00:06:41,290
You think it's a bomb?

89
00:06:42,196 --> 00:06:44,641
Why would someone put
a parachute on a bomb?

90
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:47,093
Good point.

91
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:55,451
Whoa, whoa.

92
00:06:56,398 --> 00:06:58,521
- You think that's safe?
- You want to do it?

93
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,080
Okay, I'll shut up.

94
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,012
What is that?

95
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,392
I'd tell you if I knew Chinese.

96
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:21,571
Whoa, folks, hold up.

97
00:07:21,577 --> 00:07:23,632
Let's just wait until we
know what we got here.

98
00:07:24,765 --> 00:07:25,972
It's all from China.

99
00:07:26,297 --> 00:07:28,703
- Are we being invaded?
- I doubt it.

100
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,842
If they wanted to invade,
they'd have sent troops.

101
00:07:30,848 --> 00:07:33,390
- So this is charity.
- We're getting aid from China?

102
00:07:33,397 --> 00:07:34,963
Why isn't our own government helping us?

103
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:37,773
- The United Nations or the Red Cross?
- Mayor...

104
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:40,671
Oh, hey, guys. How many chutes
did you say were out there?

105
00:07:40,675 --> 00:07:42,303
Well, I counted 12.

106
00:07:42,346 --> 00:07:45,521
Well, let's get everybody with a working
vehicle out there and round this stuff up.

107
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:47,442
- Bring them where?
- Well, for now, here.

108
00:07:47,448 --> 00:07:50,580
- And somebody find Eric for me.
- All right.
- Okay.

109
00:07:52,106 --> 00:07:57,390
So... we're down to a few cases
of liquor and three cases of near beer.

110
00:07:58,067 --> 00:07:59,853
And 13 bottles of mustard.

111
00:08:00,877 --> 00:08:02,500
What about booze from the still?

112
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:06,380
Well, the last batch tasted like paint
thinner and may cause blindness

113
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,173
but everybody drank it, so...

114
00:08:08,758 --> 00:08:11,871
I guess if they're not all
dead, then we can stay open.

115
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,442
Look, we'll figure it out.

116
00:08:14,717 --> 00:08:15,803
Everything's gonna be fine.

117
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:18,292
That makes no sense at all.

118
00:08:18,677 --> 00:08:21,590
And yet I totally, completely believe you.

119
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:24,911
What else do we need?
We got each other and mustard.

120
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:31,671
- Mayor's looking for you.
- What's up?

121
00:08:32,156 --> 00:08:34,853
- Didn't you hear?
- No, I was in the back.

122
00:08:35,518 --> 00:08:38,833
- Oh, right.
- Doing inventory.

123
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:41,680
- What is it, Jimmy?
- Uh, planes.

124
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:45,313
- There are parachutes from China
all over town. - I'm right behind you.

125
00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:49,171
I got to get back.

126
00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:50,691
Bonnie and Mimi must be freaking out.

127
00:08:50,716 --> 00:08:51,912
All right, give him a hand.

128
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,271
- Hawkins.
- Hey.

129
00:08:55,715 --> 00:08:56,803
What does it say?

130
00:08:57,198 --> 00:08:59,871
- Your guess is as good as mine.
- I doubt that.

131
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:01,510
Only one of us speaks Chinese.

132
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:04,311
What are you talking about, Jake?

133
00:09:05,105 --> 00:09:07,403
The broadcast, when it came over the
satellite, you knew it was Mandarin.

134
00:09:07,408 --> 00:09:11,171
Hey, you know, you can know when
somebody's talking German

135
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:13,421
but that doesn't mean you
can speak German, right?

136
00:09:13,425 --> 00:09:14,361
That's not what I meant at all.

137
00:09:14,447 --> 00:09:16,003
- What I'm saying is...
- Jake!

138
00:09:16,476 --> 00:09:19,232
- You get a good look at those planes?
- Yeah. The jets were mig 19s.

139
00:09:19,315 --> 00:09:22,080
- he bombers, they looked like Antonovs.
- You know your planes.

140
00:09:22,198 --> 00:09:23,632
My grandfather made sure of that.

141
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:27,942
- So they were Russian?
- Yeah, except the Russians
stopped making them in the '70s.

142
00:09:27,945 --> 00:09:31,753
- Since when do we let foreign jets
fly through our airspace?
- Happened only once.

143
00:09:31,758 --> 00:09:33,780
Italy patrolled the border after 9-11.

144
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:36,790
- But that was it.
- And Italy is an ally.

145
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:38,675
Russia? China?

146
00:09:39,132 --> 00:09:43,918
I imagine the last contact we had
with them were those missiles
we saw flying a few weeks back.

147
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,391
We can't give out this food.

148
00:09:45,665 --> 00:09:47,920
- What are you talking about?
- The people are hungry, Jake.
- I don't care.

149
00:09:47,928 --> 00:09:50,830
- We can't have this conversation here.
- Inside.

150
00:09:51,065 --> 00:09:54,480
- Jake, the people need that food.
- We all could use the food.

151
00:09:54,485 --> 00:09:55,650
How do we know it's safe?

152
00:09:55,977 --> 00:10:02,313
- Well, if the Chinese are trying to
hurt us, they sure picked a funny
way to do it. - What if, what if this
is the second wave of the attacks?

153
00:10:02,317 --> 00:10:05,051
They wait until we're hungry,
and then they poison our food supply.

154
00:10:05,057 --> 00:10:07,611
- Who would do that?
- A smart enemy.

155
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:11,230
If they were to invade, we'd have no one
healthy enough to fight them.

156
00:10:11,238 --> 00:10:12,732
It's like the British did to the Indians.

157
00:10:12,776 --> 00:10:18,251
- Gave them blankets for the winter,
but didn't mention they were
infected with smallpox. - I don't
even want to think about this.

158
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,991
Do you really think the Chinese
are trying to poison us?

159
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,450
I don't know, but whoever it was,
they had no problem blowing us up.

160
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,213
Check with April-- maybe there's
a way we can test the food.

161
00:10:27,217 --> 00:10:28,580
Well, what if there isn't?

162
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:32,711
In the meantime, we tell everybody who's
handling this stuff to put gloves on first

163
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,902
and we don't hand out to anybody
until we're sure it's safe.

164
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:40,942
We may not have that choice.

165
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:52,890
Folks, let's calm down.

166
00:10:54,777 --> 00:10:58,250
Hey! Hey!
Back it up right now!

167
00:11:01,905 --> 00:11:05,860
- Everybody, drop what you have
and take a step back!
- Bill!

168
00:11:06,108 --> 00:11:08,250
Put that damn gun away now!

169
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:10,082
Get this area cordoned off!

170
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:13,381
Don't do this, people.

171
00:11:13,388 --> 00:11:16,800
This is Jericho.
This is not some third-world village.

172
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:19,793
We got no power, no phones, no gas.

173
00:11:19,997 --> 00:11:22,631
We may not be the third world,
but we're getting there.

174
00:11:23,145 --> 00:11:24,422
We need food now.

175
00:11:24,506 --> 00:11:29,512
- Folks, we don't know what is safe
and what is not safe. - The only
people I've seen trying to hurt
us have been out on that road

176
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:31,110
and they look a lot like you and me.

177
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:36,370
This looks like help, and I say we take it.

178
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:02,291
- Are you okay?
- I am great! Come on.

179
00:12:02,298 --> 00:12:05,513
- So you know we're not being attacked?
- Yeah, of course.

180
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:07,581
I do talk to the neighbors, you know.

181
00:12:07,897 --> 00:12:08,881
Why are you so happy?

182
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:12,050
Because we have chocolate.

183
00:12:17,456 --> 00:12:20,952
That stuff wasn't half bad,
and I'm still alive.

184
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,533
The only thing that proved
is that you're clinically stupid.

185
00:12:25,928 --> 00:12:29,440
- When are you going to hand out
that food, Johnston?
- We are not having that debate here.

186
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,283
What, should we have
it in your office again?

187
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:34,732
Maybe this time I sucker punch you.

188
00:12:34,965 --> 00:12:38,661
Listen, if you're still breathing this time
tomorrow, maybe we'll distribute this stuff.

189
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:42,443
In the meantime, do the town a favor and
forget you want my job for one second.

190
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:50,020
- Seemed to be in every box.
- Yeah.

191
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:51,831
Could this mean we're
gonna be conquered?

192
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:54,030
- It doesn't say that.
- "Do not fight"?

193
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:56,221
It could be the price we pay for free food.

194
00:12:56,226 --> 00:13:02,390
- That's it. - All I know is that between
the stunt Gray's pulling and these flyers,
we could have a problem keeping order.

195
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:03,811
Is this all of the pallets?

196
00:13:03,856 --> 00:13:06,421
Almost.
They're numbered one through 12.

197
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:12,562
One through five is food
and this dried fish stuff.

198
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:16,023
Six and eight:
we got medical supplies, water.

199
00:13:16,226 --> 00:13:19,203
Ten, 11, 12: grain, blankets, and fuel.

200
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:22,240
That leaves seven and nine.
They're still missing,
but we got people looking for them.

201
00:13:22,286 --> 00:13:26,480
- We need to get this stuff off the street
before there's nothing left to protect.
- Yeah, you're right.

202
00:13:27,926 --> 00:13:29,792
My customers need that.

203
00:13:30,135 --> 00:13:32,001
You are taking everything.

204
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:35,742
With those air drops, there's no telling
what's out there to trade.

205
00:13:35,747 --> 00:13:36,673
We got to be ready.

206
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:38,291
Well, what about me?

207
00:13:38,435 --> 00:13:40,221
We had a deal, Jonah.

208
00:13:40,426 --> 00:13:43,250
You'd bring me things,
and I give you a cut.

209
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:45,062
Now you just take.

210
00:13:46,037 --> 00:13:48,711
Mitchell Cafferty, that is not yours.

211
00:13:48,998 --> 00:13:51,010
Whoa, whoa, easy, big fella.

212
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,372
Take it easy.

213
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,711
Gracie...

214
00:13:57,327 --> 00:14:01,132
Mitchell and the other guys
don't see our arrangement the way I do.

215
00:14:02,028 --> 00:14:05,802
If it were up to them, they'd just come
in here and snap your neck.

216
00:14:06,118 --> 00:14:07,513
But I don't want to see that happen.

217
00:14:10,547 --> 00:14:11,453
Let's go.

218
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,052
Long time, no see, Johnston.

219
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:33,210
It was supposed to be longer.

220
00:14:34,577 --> 00:14:36,253
Gracie, we got all this food out here.

221
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:38,623
We sure could use a place to distribute it.

222
00:14:42,978 --> 00:14:46,202
Only thing is, you'd have to stop
doing business with Jonah.

223
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:53,203
We have a deal.

224
00:14:57,487 --> 00:15:01,210
Had a deal... the one you broke.

225
00:15:03,288 --> 00:15:04,250
I'm in.

226
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,300
That stays.

227
00:15:21,607 --> 00:15:22,573
And this.

228
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:25,260
Come on. Come on.

229
00:15:34,758 --> 00:15:36,530
It's good to have you back, Mayor Green.

230
00:15:36,538 --> 00:15:40,492
Well, those prices you've been charging,
those are going to have to stop.

231
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:44,422
Hey, look,
we just need a place to store the food.

232
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:49,400
- Well, how am I going to make...? - Hey,
if you don't like it, there's always Jonah.

233
00:15:52,237 --> 00:15:53,323
I like it.

234
00:15:53,747 --> 00:15:57,323
Well, in that case, it's good to
have you back, too, Gracie.

235
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:02,091
Look.

236
00:16:13,636 --> 00:16:14,680
Isn't it great?

237
00:16:14,858 --> 00:16:17,070
Hey, hey, hey,
you don't know if that's okay.

238
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:20,373
- Well, it's not Teuscher, but in a pinch...
- I mean, you don't know if it's safe.

239
00:16:22,826 --> 00:16:25,451
Well, if the chocolate didn't impress you,

240
00:16:26,388 --> 00:16:27,351
maybe this will.

241
00:16:37,318 --> 00:16:41,600
- It's a generator. - So we can get
power back and communications.

242
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:47,333
- Listen, take my truck and go tell Jake.
- But do we have to give up all the food?

243
00:16:48,388 --> 00:16:50,372
It's not our food; it's the town's food.

244
00:16:50,498 --> 00:16:53,701
You mean, the town that was going to
blow that bridge and leave us for dead?
That town?

245
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:55,660
A: They didn't blow up the bridge,

246
00:16:55,785 --> 00:16:58,970
and B: you were on the
other side of it at the time.

247
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:01,421
Take the truck and go tell Jake.

248
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:04,071
We're not sharing the chocolate.

249
00:17:10,986 --> 00:17:14,923
- And we can fit all the food into
Gracie's store. - Good, good.

250
00:17:15,177 --> 00:17:19,133
Regarding the medical supplies,
would you guys mind, um...?

251
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:22,391
I'll go to the clinic and give them to April.

252
00:17:23,295 --> 00:17:24,341
Thank you.

253
00:17:25,438 --> 00:17:27,761
So, are we going to see
you for Thanksgiving?

254
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:31,033
I think Mary and I are
going to spend it together.

255
00:17:32,015 --> 00:17:33,271
Well, you're always welcome.

256
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:34,981
Football starts at 3:00.

257
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:38,501
Thanks, but I don't want to put you guys
in an awkward position.

258
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:42,421
You could have thought of that
before you moved in with your
mistress and left your wife with us.

259
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:49,200
- I'd better get back to Main Street.
- Thanks, son.

260
00:17:52,397 --> 00:17:54,843
Yeah, now it feels like the holidays.

261
00:17:56,986 --> 00:18:00,361
- Why do you keep acting
like it's no big deal? - I don't.

262
00:18:00,828 --> 00:18:04,632
- I'm also trying not to act like a hypocrite.
- Oh...

263
00:18:06,347 --> 00:18:10,113
- This is nothing like what
we went through. - Oh, no?

264
00:18:11,477 --> 00:18:15,903
I seem to recall when my mother thought
your name was "the other woman."

265
00:18:16,255 --> 00:18:19,292
And I ignored her just the way
Eric's ignoring us.

266
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,100
Now, if this is so different,
I'm not seeing it.

267
00:18:21,108 --> 00:18:24,250
It is different, because we were
barely in our 20s

268
00:18:24,428 --> 00:18:26,160
she wasn't your wife...

269
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:29,661
...and she wasn't pregnant.

270
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:32,441
April's pregnant.

271
00:18:34,268 --> 00:18:35,551
She's a few months along.

272
00:18:37,768 --> 00:18:38,851
Does Eric know?

273
00:18:40,408 --> 00:18:42,420
April made me promise not to tell him.

274
00:18:46,277 --> 00:18:51,753
So, then, um, you're mad at Eric over
something he doesn't even know about?

275
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,550
That bag of rice could
feed this whole crowd.

276
00:19:44,677 --> 00:19:46,201
They'd like to know when
they're gonna see some of it.

277
00:19:46,206 --> 00:19:48,233
Well, odd as it might seem to you, Gray,

278
00:19:48,318 --> 00:19:51,192
we're trying come up with a plan
to distribute this stuff fairly.

279
00:19:51,198 --> 00:19:52,963
It might have to last
us through the winter.

280
00:19:53,046 --> 00:19:53,900
Through the winter?

281
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:59,130
- My family's hungry now, not when you
decide it's okay for them to be hungry.
- This might be the last food we get.

282
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:03,232
- Yeah? Well, we're not getting it, Jake,
you are. - Look, we're hungry, too, Bill!

283
00:20:03,238 --> 00:20:05,522
Bill, nobody here is taking anything.

284
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:09,021
If you'll just wait, you'll find there's
plenty of this to go around.

285
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:13,800
It may come as a surprise to
some of you Greens, but many
of us can think for ourselves.

286
00:20:13,805 --> 00:20:16,141
It is like Filene's Basement out here.

287
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:18,842
- Oh, never mind.
- Where's Stanley?

288
00:20:18,877 --> 00:20:20,703
- He's back at the farm.
- We found two more parachutes.

289
00:20:20,705 --> 00:20:22,073
One of them has a generator.

290
00:20:22,105 --> 00:20:23,313
What are we doing here?

291
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:44,213
Where is it?

292
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:47,981
Well, it was right here.

293
00:20:53,565 --> 00:20:54,552
Let's try this way.

294
00:21:10,688 --> 00:21:11,771
Oh, my God.

295
00:21:12,435 --> 00:21:13,282
Stanley.

296
00:21:15,977 --> 00:21:19,890
- Hey, what happened?
- Jonah...

297
00:21:31,268 --> 00:21:33,280
Nobody grabs a gun until we have a plan.

298
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,531
- Jonah could have killed Stanley.
- But he didn't.

299
00:21:35,536 --> 00:21:39,220
And I'm not getting us into a firefight
unless I can get us out--
all of us.

300
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:41,680
Look, why don't I go down there with
Jimmy and Bill and talk to them.

301
00:21:41,728 --> 00:21:44,760
Uh, all due respect, Eric...
hell no.

302
00:21:44,865 --> 00:21:46,690
Look, Jonah knows he's outnumbered.

303
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,100
If we let him know our intent,
he will listen to reason.

304
00:21:49,105 --> 00:21:53,093
Yeah, let's talk to him, 'cause that's
worked out so well in the past.

305
00:21:53,096 --> 00:21:57,420
- If you'd shut Jonah down when I told
you to, we wouldn't be having this
conversation. - We need that generator.

306
00:21:57,536 --> 00:21:58,840
Without it we're stuck in the 1800s,

307
00:21:58,955 --> 00:22:02,720
and the longer we wait, the longer
Jonah has to hide it or to trade it off.

308
00:22:04,045 --> 00:22:07,860
- It's now or not at all. - Nobody moves
on the compound unless I say so.

309
00:22:07,937 --> 00:22:10,911
Nobody shoots unless I say so.
Are we clear?

310
00:22:12,006 --> 00:22:12,693
Yes, sir.

311
00:22:12,696 --> 00:22:13,971
All right then, let's load up.

312
00:22:13,977 --> 00:22:16,491
- I'll take Jimmy and Bill...
- You sit this one out, Gray.

313
00:22:17,138 --> 00:22:18,393
I have Jonah to worry about.

314
00:22:18,488 --> 00:22:20,311
I don't need somebody
shooting me in the back.

315
00:22:27,575 --> 00:22:30,532
Maybe Dad will be home in time
for our first Christmas together.

316
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:34,901
- He'll be here.
Won't he, Mom?
- Yes, he will.

317
00:22:34,985 --> 00:22:36,771
You know what I'm most thankful for?

318
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:40,092
Being reminded of how many
excuses you always made for him.

319
00:22:46,506 --> 00:22:48,322
Doctor said no concussion, so...

320
00:22:48,407 --> 00:22:50,690
That thick skull of yours
finally came in handy.

321
00:22:55,018 --> 00:22:58,701
- Where do you think you're going?
- After Jonah.
- No, you aren't.

322
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:00,550
Stanley, please don't go.

323
00:23:01,865 --> 00:23:04,262
Stanley, if anything happened to you...

324
00:23:07,268 --> 00:23:08,232
Think of Bonnie.

325
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:24,272
- Where you going?
- To get the generator.

326
00:23:24,355 --> 00:23:25,752
- From Jonah?
- Yeah.

327
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:28,753
- Slow down-- we can think
of a better way. - It's too late.

328
00:23:28,756 --> 00:23:31,083
Even if you get the generator, it
won't end there.

329
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:34,031
If you push my father,
Jake, he'll push back.

330
00:23:34,427 --> 00:23:35,713
What do you want me to do?

331
00:23:54,138 --> 00:23:55,062
I've got Jonah.

332
00:23:55,776 --> 00:23:57,240
What about those pallets?

333
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,293
- I don't see them.
- Maybe they're gone already.

334
00:24:04,436 --> 00:24:05,680
Maybe not.

335
00:24:06,935 --> 00:24:08,302
They're on that flatbed.

336
00:24:12,727 --> 00:24:13,571
Okay.

337
00:24:55,115 --> 00:24:55,961
Jonah.

338
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:57,841
Johnston.

339
00:25:00,017 --> 00:25:02,423
Give us the generator,
you can keep everything else.

340
00:25:02,705 --> 00:25:04,562
I've got no idea what you're talking about.

341
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:06,431
Let's take a look around,
I'll show you.

342
00:25:06,436 --> 00:25:09,590
Sorry. Private property still
means something out here.

343
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:14,290
Now, if I still had a way of making a living
at Gracie's market...

344
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:16,511
this might be a different conversation.

345
00:25:16,665 --> 00:25:18,122
Open the gate or we're coming through.

346
00:25:18,218 --> 00:25:20,492
Those supplies dropped for everyone,
not just you.

347
00:25:20,496 --> 00:25:22,243
You don't get to decide for the rest of us.

348
00:25:22,247 --> 00:25:23,852
I'm looking out for the whole town,
what about you?

349
00:25:23,976 --> 00:25:27,161
Who the hell do you think saved
Jericho from those mercenaries?

350
00:25:27,595 --> 00:25:28,993
I'm hanging on to the genny.

351
00:25:29,235 --> 00:25:30,212
We'll call it even.

352
00:25:30,715 --> 00:25:33,131
This doesn't end well
for either of us, Jonah.

353
00:25:42,617 --> 00:25:43,550
Let's get ready.

354
00:25:58,646 --> 00:25:59,730
He's taking the genny!

355
00:26:00,745 --> 00:26:01,990
He's taking the truck out!

356
00:26:04,015 --> 00:26:05,790
- Who the hell...?
- Hold it, don't shoot.

357
00:26:25,346 --> 00:26:26,613
What the hell were you thinking?

358
00:26:27,745 --> 00:26:30,580
That you could have gotten killed,
and Jonah wouldn't have hurt me.

359
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:31,862
What?

360
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:33,471
- What about Mitchell?
- He almost shot you.

361
00:26:33,477 --> 00:26:36,081
- Hell, we almost shot you.
- But you didn't, Jake.

362
00:26:36,588 --> 00:26:39,780
- God, when we were in high school you
would have been right there with me.
- We're not kids anymore.

363
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:43,131
Why don't you just say, "good job"?

364
00:26:43,848 --> 00:26:46,443
- What...? No.
- I know it's what you're thinking.

365
00:26:52,586 --> 00:26:54,761
- I'll put these back on my way out.
- Wait up, son.

366
00:26:55,428 --> 00:26:57,590
I got to go--
I told Mary I'd be back an hour ago.

367
00:26:57,597 --> 00:27:00,823
Well, she's waited this long,
she can wait five more minutes.

368
00:27:01,817 --> 00:27:02,700
Grab a chair.

369
00:27:08,017 --> 00:27:12,951
Now, son,
we both know that marriage is hard.

370
00:27:13,078 --> 00:27:14,570
It's a little late for this speech, Dad.

371
00:27:14,618 --> 00:27:17,340
Fine. I'll just fast-forward to the next one.

372
00:27:18,176 --> 00:27:19,531
Fatherhood is harder.

373
00:27:19,727 --> 00:27:22,063
- What are you talking about?
- April's pregnant.

374
00:27:23,116 --> 00:27:24,702
I just found out myself.

375
00:27:34,665 --> 00:27:36,020
And I got to hear this from you?

376
00:27:37,967 --> 00:27:39,711
Well, I shouldn't be the one telling you.

377
00:27:39,835 --> 00:27:41,923
I'll probably be in the doghouse
till next Thanksgiving

378
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:42,932
but I thought you ought to know.

379
00:27:42,935 --> 00:27:45,073
- Well, I had no idea.
- Now you do.

380
00:27:45,417 --> 00:27:46,840
And now you need to do the right thing.

381
00:27:46,845 --> 00:27:50,262
- I have, Dad. I tried to work
things out with April. - Try harder.

382
00:27:50,348 --> 00:27:54,031
Look, a bad marriage doesn't get
better because you add a kid.

383
00:27:54,946 --> 00:27:55,870
No.

384
00:27:56,778 --> 00:27:57,673
No, it doesn't,

385
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:01,380
but you are going to have to stop thinking
about yourself first.

386
00:28:01,425 --> 00:28:04,291
You give up that right when you
bring a child into this world.

387
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:15,111
Son, you and April had the bad luck to
fall out of love at the same time

388
00:28:15,118 --> 00:28:16,583
but you can get that back.

389
00:28:17,325 --> 00:28:18,581
You're not hearing me, Dad.

390
00:28:21,657 --> 00:28:23,202
I don't think I ever loved April.

391
00:28:27,325 --> 00:28:28,371
I love Mary.

392
00:28:31,058 --> 00:28:32,372
And I have to trust that.

393
00:28:42,717 --> 00:28:44,151
My old friend iodine.

394
00:28:45,168 --> 00:28:47,103
Okay, so what do I do here?

395
00:28:47,348 --> 00:28:50,720
Just, um, dab the cotton ball in the iodine.

396
00:28:50,747 --> 00:28:52,183
Put the cotton ball on the cut.

397
00:28:53,547 --> 00:28:54,241
Ow!

398
00:28:56,388 --> 00:28:58,910
- Gently, please.
- I'm sorry.

399
00:28:59,267 --> 00:29:00,701
I'm not very good at this.

400
00:29:03,378 --> 00:29:08,660
- You know, I'm going to be okay, so...
- No, the doctor said that we had to
clean the wounds twice a day.

401
00:29:08,935 --> 00:29:10,831
So come on, please, off with the shirt.

402
00:29:13,096 --> 00:29:14,801
What do I got to close my eyes?

403
00:29:19,815 --> 00:29:21,442
Oh, my God.

404
00:29:22,066 --> 00:29:23,862
- You're, uh...
- What?

405
00:29:25,115 --> 00:29:26,161
You're blushing.

406
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:28,501
It's a reaction to the iodine, okay?

407
00:29:28,575 --> 00:29:32,940
- Ow! - I think it's a reaction to
having your shirt off in front
of me. - Don't flatter yourself.

408
00:29:34,227 --> 00:29:35,812
Come on, come on, I'm not done.

409
00:29:36,136 --> 00:29:38,190
Please, off with the shirt.

410
00:29:42,357 --> 00:29:44,403
You know, I'd guess a lot of things
about you

411
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,813
but being shy in front of
women wasn't one of them.

412
00:29:47,055 --> 00:29:50,771
If, we're... if we're going to do this, can we
at least talk about something else please?

413
00:29:51,287 --> 00:29:52,913
- Like what?
- I don't know...

414
00:29:54,786 --> 00:29:56,681
What do you usually do on Thanksgiving?

415
00:29:58,316 --> 00:30:00,832
My mom and I go to
a resort in Punta Mita.

416
00:30:01,695 --> 00:30:03,283
- That's Mexico.
- Hmm.

417
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:06,021
Why?
What do you do?

418
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:12,642
Uh... watch football, eat turkey,
take a nap, like everybody else I guess.

419
00:30:13,348 --> 00:30:14,532
Well, you're missing out.

420
00:30:15,005 --> 00:30:17,020
Lounging by the infinity pool

421
00:30:17,145 --> 00:30:24,331
watching the surfer boys and sipping
what most experts would agree is
the world's finest mango margarita.

422
00:30:25,186 --> 00:30:26,153
Sounds fun.

423
00:30:27,447 --> 00:30:30,431
Un-American, but fun.

424
00:30:33,985 --> 00:30:34,881
It was.

425
00:30:36,445 --> 00:30:37,332
You're all set.

426
00:30:40,097 --> 00:30:41,572
Sorry you had to suffer through that.

427
00:30:58,358 --> 00:30:59,753
What's the plan, Jonah?

428
00:31:02,515 --> 00:31:04,231
The day I have to answer to you, Mitchell,

429
00:31:05,206 --> 00:31:07,000
we're in deeper trouble than I thought.

430
00:31:09,996 --> 00:31:11,280
You don't have to answer to me.

431
00:31:12,607 --> 00:31:13,571
You have to answer to them.

432
00:31:16,377 --> 00:31:18,391
Hey, I always find a way.

433
00:31:19,715 --> 00:31:20,951
Not today you didn't.

434
00:31:21,806 --> 00:31:27,133
- They outplayed us... once.
It happens.
- No, they didn't outplay us...

435
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:28,603
she outplayed you.

436
00:31:31,138 --> 00:31:33,380
Are you mad that I didn't
let you take the shot?

437
00:31:33,657 --> 00:31:37,130
- That I didn't let you kill my daughter?
- You're getting soft, Jonah.

438
00:31:37,326 --> 00:31:41,111
- And your mistakes are costing us.
- Saving Emily was no mistake.

439
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,412
What about letting Mayor Green kick
you out of town?

440
00:31:44,807 --> 00:31:46,121
I mean, come on, for God...

441
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:49,281
You were taking orders from
Gracie Leigh this morning.

442
00:31:49,287 --> 00:31:53,052
Hey, all you need to remember is I'm the
guy that keeps saving your ass.

443
00:31:53,336 --> 00:31:55,001
You think you can do
a better job than me?

444
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:57,291
You going to make your move?

445
00:32:01,645 --> 00:32:02,811
I didn't think so.

446
00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:05,383
Let's go.

447
00:32:08,295 --> 00:32:10,122
You think we should hold
on to these parachutes?

448
00:32:10,277 --> 00:32:12,373
- I mean, they're pretty trashed.
- Why not?

449
00:32:12,917 --> 00:32:15,401
You can make some of those pants
you used to wear in high school.

450
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:20,272
Hey.

451
00:32:22,585 --> 00:32:23,323
What's that?

452
00:32:25,388 --> 00:32:26,703
It looks like a microchip.

453
00:32:30,347 --> 00:32:31,150
What's it for?

454
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:33,131
I don't know.

455
00:32:34,376 --> 00:32:35,611
But I know who to ask.

456
00:32:36,466 --> 00:32:40,813
They're called RFIDs--
Radio Frequency Identifiers.

457
00:32:41,366 --> 00:32:43,572
- It's like a bar code, right?
- Yeah.

458
00:32:43,818 --> 00:32:46,460
You know, if we had the right equipment,
we could find out who sent 'em here.

459
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:48,281
How do you know about this, Mr. Hawkins?

460
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:49,960
I read a lot, Eric.

461
00:32:50,818 --> 00:32:51,882
Why are they in the chutes?

462
00:32:51,946 --> 00:32:56,782
They're used for tracking
inventory, mostly by big global
companies and by one military.

463
00:32:56,787 --> 00:32:59,030
- China?
- No, the U.S.

464
00:32:59,237 --> 00:33:02,721
These chutes, they're from our air force.

465
00:33:02,727 --> 00:33:03,693
Let me get this straight now--

466
00:33:03,735 --> 00:33:09,282
we're talking about Vietnam-era
planes flying through Kansas
airspace doing a Chinese drop

467
00:33:09,285 --> 00:33:11,381
and they're using U.S. Air
Force equipment to do it.

468
00:33:11,387 --> 00:33:12,432
Sounds about right.

469
00:33:12,478 --> 00:33:15,850
- In what world does that make sense?
- Ours.

470
00:33:23,357 --> 00:33:24,253
Stanley?

471
00:33:25,575 --> 00:33:27,433
- Stanley?
- In the kitchen.

472
00:33:29,388 --> 00:33:31,442
You are not supposed to be up.

473
00:33:31,496 --> 00:33:33,902
- You know what?
- I-I don't have a turkey, but, uh...

474
00:33:34,835 --> 00:33:36,093
I do have tequila.

475
00:33:38,495 --> 00:33:39,641
What about mangoes?

476
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:41,781
You know, I've never seen a mango.

477
00:33:42,836 --> 00:33:46,913
- But... I have Tang.
- Instant Tang?

478
00:33:46,957 --> 00:33:50,143
So in honor of your, um,
first Thanksgiving here in Jericho

479
00:33:50,377 --> 00:33:54,990
I've made what some critics
believe to be the world's finest...

480
00:33:56,047 --> 00:33:57,253
Tang-o margaritas.

481
00:34:03,988 --> 00:34:05,340
Oh, that's awesome.

482
00:34:33,546 --> 00:34:38,542
- Hey, listen, your father's not a
hundred percent, so no roughing
up the passer. - Are you kidding?

483
00:34:38,546 --> 00:34:41,700
- What?
- All of it-- I mean, the football,
the Thanksgiving dinner, I mean...

484
00:34:41,795 --> 00:34:46,210
- What about it? - Well, we're just
holding on to these... these traditions
like nothing happened out there?

485
00:34:46,298 --> 00:34:49,793
We're holding on to these traditions
because of what happened out there.

486
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,180
Oh, son!

487
00:34:53,698 --> 00:34:54,930
Good to see you made it.

488
00:34:57,888 --> 00:34:59,133
Yeah. I'm not staying.

489
00:35:01,595 --> 00:35:03,561
I was wondering if I could talk to April.

490
00:35:06,517 --> 00:35:07,361
Sure.

491
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:30,092
So... it's over.

492
00:35:31,108 --> 00:35:31,950
Yeah.

493
00:35:34,095 --> 00:35:36,031
When were you planning on
telling me about the baby?

494
00:35:43,627 --> 00:35:46,152
When I knew it wouldn't
affect your decision.

495
00:35:48,068 --> 00:35:50,903
I didn't want you to stay with
me because of the baby, Eric.

496
00:35:50,906 --> 00:35:54,090
- Well, I think we're the only two
people that agree on that.
- Great.

497
00:35:56,695 --> 00:35:57,831
Why did you come here?

498
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:04,782
I came here to tell you that I'm sorry
for what I did

499
00:36:06,067 --> 00:36:07,741
but I can't live a lie anymore.

500
00:36:10,578 --> 00:36:13,060
And I'll do whatever it takes
to take care of that baby.

501
00:36:18,007 --> 00:36:19,792
Why should I believe you?

502
00:36:24,736 --> 00:36:25,850
You don't have to believe me.

503
00:36:28,576 --> 00:36:29,480
I'll just be there.

504
00:36:47,795 --> 00:36:50,880
- I think that's it.
- How do we know this thing isn't
some kind of bomb?

505
00:36:51,586 --> 00:36:53,910
Well, Gray's still alive, so let's risk it, huh?

506
00:36:58,347 --> 00:36:59,743
Thanks for your help, Mr. Hawkins.

507
00:37:00,487 --> 00:37:02,890
- Sorry to take you away on Thanksgiving.
- Yeah.

508
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:05,533
Hey, you know what, Bill?

509
00:37:06,778 --> 00:37:08,520
Could you hold off?

510
00:37:09,887 --> 00:37:11,311
Just give me ten minutes.

511
00:37:12,168 --> 00:37:13,132
No problem.

512
00:37:14,185 --> 00:37:15,151
Thanks.

513
00:37:18,328 --> 00:37:20,231
Guess we have one less dish to wash.

514
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:27,691
Did you know about all this?
Eric and Mary?

515
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:29,672
You don't have to answer that.

516
00:37:31,037 --> 00:37:32,041
I knew a little.

517
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:34,672
Think it'll work out?

518
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:37,622
He says she makes him happy.

519
00:37:37,718 --> 00:37:41,071
Well, what about when she doesn't make
him happy, he's gonna leave her, too?

520
00:37:41,078 --> 00:37:45,580
- Dad, it's not your problem.
- I know, I know, it's just...

521
00:37:46,187 --> 00:37:52,981
- my one goal when I was raising you boys
was that even when things got tough you
made the right choices. - Hi, Emily. - Hey.

522
00:37:53,217 --> 00:37:54,432
Glad you could make it.

523
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:56,961
You missed the football.

524
00:37:58,488 --> 00:37:59,881
I didn't want to show Jake up.

525
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,153
- Really.
- Mm-hmm.

526
00:38:04,145 --> 00:38:06,861
Hey, Jake, honey, put Emily next to you.

527
00:38:07,355 --> 00:38:08,093
Thank you.

528
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,841
God, I hope April has a girl.

529
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:14,842
Hey.

530
00:38:20,858 --> 00:38:21,793
I'm sorry.

531
00:38:22,168 --> 00:38:24,092
Yeah, that might've flown two hours ago.

532
00:38:24,778 --> 00:38:25,602
I know.

533
00:38:26,078 --> 00:38:27,352
I know, but, uh...

534
00:38:28,216 --> 00:38:29,223
Wait.

535
00:38:33,935 --> 00:38:35,602
Look, um, will you come with me?

536
00:38:36,115 --> 00:38:38,913
There's, uh,
something I want to show you.

537
00:38:41,565 --> 00:38:43,083
Please, D.

538
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:02,393
Hey, Bill.

539
00:39:03,768 --> 00:39:04,891
Thanks. Go ahead.

540
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:29,213
You believe that?

541
00:39:31,986 --> 00:39:32,951
Wow!

542
00:39:35,268 --> 00:39:36,272
See, uh...

543
00:39:37,888 --> 00:39:39,713
this is what Daddy did at work today.

544
00:40:44,756 --> 00:40:45,683
Bye, Gracie.
