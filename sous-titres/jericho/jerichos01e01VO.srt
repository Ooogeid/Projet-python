3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,420
(When there's nowhere else to run)

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,920
(Is there room for one more son?)

5
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,520
(One more son)

6
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,580
(If you can hold on)

7
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,380
(If you can hold on...)

8
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,180
(hold on)

9
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,220
(I wanna stand up,)

10
00:01:15,426 --> 00:01:16,942
(I wanna let go)

11
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:18,742
(You know, you know,)

12
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,005
(no, you don't, you don't)

13
00:01:21,477 --> 00:01:25,567
(I wanna shine on in the hearts of men)

14
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:29,621
(I want a meaning from the back of my broken hand )

15
00:01:29,626 --> 00:01:33,571
(Another head aches, another heart breaks)

16
00:01:33,576 --> 00:01:37,823
(I'm so much older than I can take... )

17
00:01:37,827 --> 00:01:39,800
...is high on Capital Hill

18
00:01:39,806 --> 00:01:41,240
as an emergency session of Congress

19
00:01:41,248 --> 00:01:45,721
prepares to hear the President address the issue
of global violence.

20
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:49,823
Recent attacks have pushed this administration
to take extreme action

21
00:01:49,987 --> 00:01:52,323
raising more fears than it's alleviated.

22
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:54,013
With global tension rising,

23
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:56,400
the President is taking a risky step

24
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,973
by confronting what some political observers...

25
00:02:03,475 --> 00:02:04,523
Oh, I can't believe it.

26
00:02:05,676 --> 00:02:06,533
Jake Green.

27
00:02:07,035 --> 00:02:08,593
How you doing, man?

28
00:02:09,635 --> 00:02:11,641
--When did you get back to town?
--Just now.

29
00:02:12,455 --> 00:02:13,223
Is that Bonnie?

30
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:15,920
You grew up.

31
00:02:16,768 --> 00:02:18,132
Wait a minute, where the hell you been?

32
00:02:19,217 --> 00:02:20,311
You know, around.

33
00:02:20,788 --> 00:02:24,340
--Jake, no one's been around for five years.
--The Army.

34
00:02:24,595 --> 00:02:27,153
--I've been in the Army.
--Good for you.

35
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:30,530
--Who's that?
--She's from the IRS.

36
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:33,333
--IRS? Audit IRS?
--Yeah.

37
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:37,042
--Not going well?
--No. Forget it.

38
00:02:37,045 --> 00:02:40,081
How about you and I, we go out
tonight and we catch up?

39
00:02:40,087 --> 00:02:42,383
I'd love to, but I just came in
to see my grandfather, and

40
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:44,610
--I've got to get back, so...
--Okay.

41
00:02:45,946 --> 00:02:46,720
Bonnie.

42
00:02:50,325 --> 00:02:52,730
Bonnie, we need a pie.
One strawberry rhubarb.

43
00:02:55,548 --> 00:02:57,530
Welcome back to Jericho, Jake.

44
00:03:01,107 --> 00:03:02,401
His wife is lovely,

45
00:03:02,526 --> 00:03:04,232
but I don't know about him.

46
00:03:04,586 --> 00:03:07,580
Mrs. Olsen made me promise not to tell,

47
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:11,032
but she heard that he bought the old Thompson
place in cash.

48
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:12,431
Cash.

49
00:03:14,155 --> 00:03:17,273
--That color looks really good on you.
--I know.

50
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:21,633
--Why didn't your mom take you to New York?
--'Cause she hates me.

51
00:03:23,585 --> 00:03:25,333
What are you looking at, loser?

52
00:03:29,855 --> 00:03:33,280
I could be shopping in SoHo right now
instead of Gracie's Market.

53
00:03:33,285 --> 00:03:34,651
--I know. Look at this thing--
--so ugly.

54
00:03:35,596 --> 00:03:38,471
--Promise not to tell?
--Promise, Mrs. Leigh.

55
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,070
What about you, Jake?

56
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:41,681
Where have you been keeping yourself?

57
00:03:42,546 --> 00:03:44,413
I've been playing minor league baseball.

58
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:47,110
Oh, is that a fact?

59
00:03:47,835 --> 00:03:48,651
Well...

60
00:03:49,165 --> 00:03:50,602
when do you get in from Chicago?

61
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:53,093
All right.

62
00:03:53,927 --> 00:03:55,632
Good. I'll pick you up.

63
00:04:01,596 --> 00:04:02,730
I love you, too.

64
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:09,230
--Hey.
--Sorry, hi. Um...

65
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,131
What are you doing here?

66
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:14,893
I just came in for the day to visit my grandfather,

67
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:17,690
--see the family.
--Yeah, of course, sure.

68
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:20,910
--I just didn't hear.
--Anyway, how you been?

69
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:23,212
Mom tells me you're teaching at the high school now.

70
00:04:24,135 --> 00:04:26,230
--Yeah, it's weird, huh?
--Yeah.

71
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:27,110
I love it.

72
00:04:28,106 --> 00:04:29,851
I just bought a house in the Pines.

73
00:04:30,596 --> 00:04:32,401
The East Side on a teacher's salary?

74
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,043
Uh, my-my fianc?

75
00:04:35,156 --> 00:04:37,300
he's in banking, so...

76
00:04:38,428 --> 00:04:42,271
--Oh, that helps.
--Yeah, Roger really loves it here.

77
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,862
Well, I'm happy for you, Emily.

78
00:04:47,445 --> 00:04:49,631
--How about you, you got somebody?
--No.

79
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:54,890
--I'm sorry, I shouldn't...
--No, you're not, you love it.

80
00:04:59,335 --> 00:05:02,841
--Where have you been?
--The Navy.

81
00:05:06,468 --> 00:05:08,053
Oh, why do I even bother?

82
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,590
Seriously...

83
00:05:10,537 --> 00:05:11,971
where have you been?

84
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:17,041
(And you ask me what I want this year)

85
00:05:17,045 --> 00:05:21,251
(And I try to make this kind and clear)

86
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:28,941
(Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days )

87
00:05:29,606 --> 00:05:34,241
('Cause I don't need boxes wrapped in strings)

88
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:38,213
(And desire and love and empty things)

89
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:47,101
(Just a chance that maybe we'll find better days)

90
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:50,711
(So take these words..)

91
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:50,760
Oh, Jake!

92
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:52,371
Oh, honey!

93
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:56,271
--Oh, you're home!
--You're choking me, Mom.

94
00:05:57,278 --> 00:05:58,812
I thought I heard an annoying voice.

95
00:05:58,977 --> 00:06:01,620
--Hey, brother.
--Good to see you.

96
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:09,182
('Cause tonight's the night the world begins again.)

97
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:11,091
I'm not here to interfere with your campaign, Dad.

98
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:12,463
All  I want is your signature,

99
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:13,591
then I'll visit Grandpa...

100
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:14,821
After five years, Jake,

101
00:06:14,827 --> 00:06:15,993
that's all you have to say to Dad?

102
00:06:15,995 --> 00:06:19,620
--It's none of your business, Eric.
--It is his business, it is all our business.

103
00:06:19,626 --> 00:06:22,200
--What you put this family through...
--Johnston. For god's sake.

104
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,082
--Now, he could've been...
--We could spend a week talking about what
I could've been, all right?

105
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:25,971
I've  apologized.

106
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:27,252
I've made amends.

107
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:28,891
This is me now.

108
00:06:29,395 --> 00:06:32,262
--I have a plan, but I need my money to make a clean start.
--It's not your money,

109
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:35,180
--it's your grandfather's money.
--I know, but he gave it to me for a reason.

110
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:37,832
And he gave me authority over it for a reason.

111
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:44,002
--You convince me you're leading a more
productive life and then...
--That's right, Jake.

112
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,760
We  were both born on third base.

113
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:47,590
Quit pretending you hit a triple.

114
00:06:50,856 --> 00:06:54,890
--Now, when are you going to realize
I'm 32-years-old.
--When you do.

115
00:07:00,717 --> 00:07:03,391
Can I talk to my mayor then, huh?

116
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:08,922
Let's go see your grandfather.

117
00:07:13,487 --> 00:07:15,932
--I just...
--Stop it, Jake.

118
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,363
--The one thing I can't...
--You would have been here if you could.

119
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:31,392
I brought money.

120
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:33,863
--Here.
--I can't, Mom.

121
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:37,682
--I'll talk to your father.
--He doesn't get it.

122
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:41,432
--Because you won't tell him
why you really need the money.
--Mom.

123
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:43,061
You don't give him enough credit.

124
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:46,102
--Your dad's had a few trials of his own, you know?
--He can never know.

125
00:07:52,728 --> 00:07:53,702
Just...

126
00:07:53,885 --> 00:07:57,613
--Stay one more day.
--I got to get back to San Diego by tomorrow.

127
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,471
--Mom, one more thing.
--Hmm?

128
00:08:08,228 --> 00:08:09,790
You have clumsy hands.

129
00:08:12,355 --> 00:08:13,481
I love you.

130
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:15,530
Be careful now, okay?

131
00:08:33,995 --> 00:08:37,862
Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States.

132
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:42,541
Do I have to watch this?

133
00:08:47,336 --> 00:08:53,832
(Old McDonald had a farm E-I-E-I-O)

134
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,201
Yeah, well, we finally found
a garage where we can fix it.

135
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:55,843
We had to take a detour.

136
00:09:01,255 --> 00:09:03,003
...ocean of hatred...

137
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:04,271
Feel like I'm back in D.C.

138
00:09:03,735 --> 00:09:05,681
...in our great nation, and yet,

139
00:09:05,887 --> 00:09:08,551
we all know that these divisions
pale in comparison

140
00:09:08,557 --> 00:09:11,750
to the fundamental dangers
posed by the threat of terror.

141
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:14,353
We have an eternal commitment
to leave the world

142
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:16,710
a better place for our children and grandchildren.

143
00:09:16,716 --> 00:09:20,640
This has always been our promise and this
will always...

144
00:09:19,301 --> 00:09:24,722
Five, four, three, two, one.

145
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:30,305
We'll be back in an hour, Mr. McVey.

146
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,657
Mr. McVey? Hello?

147
00:09:36,005 --> 00:09:37,031
...carried on...

148
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:46,203
We have...

149
00:09:57,206 --> 00:09:58,532
No fun, Woody.

150
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,870
You have to hide better!

151
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:10,000
Woody?

152
00:10:11,728 --> 00:10:13,161
What are you looking at?

153
00:10:56,116 --> 00:10:57,241
Look! Look it!

154
00:11:01,587 --> 00:11:02,810
Hurry on there right now.

155
00:11:03,285 --> 00:11:05,083
Yeah, you better hurry up and get on home then.

156
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,942
Where's Cody?!

157
00:11:05,987 --> 00:11:07,903
Has anyone seen Cody?

158
00:11:08,436 --> 00:11:09,603
We haven't got time.

159
00:11:20,356 --> 00:11:21,830
Shh.

160
00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:25,282
Gail, what's going on?

161
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:28,870
Oh, Johnston.

162
00:11:32,768 --> 00:11:33,550
Nothing.

163
00:11:34,605 --> 00:11:36,831
All right, it looks like the explosion
came from the west,

164
00:11:36,836 --> 00:11:37,422
maybe Denver.

165
00:11:37,508 --> 00:11:39,140
Jimmy, get on the radio.

166
00:11:39,146 --> 00:11:40,553
I want everybody at the sheriff's station.

167
00:11:40,555 --> 00:11:42,552
--I'll pick up Eric. Let's move.
--All right.

168
00:11:42,557 --> 00:11:44,040
Dad, don't leave.

169
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:46,980
Come here.

170
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,351
I'll be back real soon, all right?

171
00:11:59,455 --> 00:12:00,583
Johnston.

172
00:12:03,276 --> 00:12:04,320
Jake.

173
00:12:06,296 --> 00:12:07,501
We'll find him.

174
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,071
We're bringing them out of the mine,

175
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:43,521
five at a time like always.

176
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:44,881
No need to start a panic.

177
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:48,192
--You're just trying to get another
hour's work out of my men!
--Stop it, the both of you.

178
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:52,020
Norman, get everybody out of the mine immediately.

179
00:12:52,025 --> 00:12:53,970
And Shep, help him for a change.

180
00:12:55,695 --> 00:12:57,441
--Sheriff? Chief?
--Yeah?

181
00:12:57,445 --> 00:13:00,592
--Damage, fires, buildings?
--Nothing, Mr. Mayor.

182
00:13:00,598 --> 00:13:02,342
--The town's fine.
--Well, let's hope you're right.

183
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:03,282
What does that mean?

184
00:13:05,268 --> 00:13:06,940
Do we have any Geiger counters?

185
00:13:11,836 --> 00:13:12,550
Excuse me?

186
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:13,472
Uh, excuse me.

187
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:15,153
Did something happen?

188
00:13:15,936 --> 00:13:17,922
So, what does the emergency plan say?

189
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:21,342
Contact the governor, National Guard
and state troopers.

190
00:13:21,697 --> 00:13:25,823
--Are we under attack?
--Son, I don't want to hear that word again.

191
00:13:26,336 --> 00:13:27,560
Now look, this could have been a test.

192
00:13:27,565 --> 00:13:28,552
It could have been an accident.

193
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,001
There's, uh, military bases near Denver.

194
00:13:31,595 --> 00:13:34,122
One explosion does not make an attack.

195
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:36,623
If we stay calm,

196
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:38,243
the town stays calm, okay?

197
00:13:59,268 --> 00:14:00,273
Oh.

198
00:14:00,985 --> 00:14:02,790
--I found the Geiger counters.
--Thanks.

199
00:14:03,095 --> 00:14:04,541
Oh, Grey, good to see you.

200
00:14:04,597 --> 00:14:07,193
--We can use the extra help.
--Well, thank you, Johnston, Eric.

201
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:10,702
--Well, what can I do to help?
--We'll let you know.

202
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:15,990
Does it work, Dad?

203
00:14:18,216 --> 00:14:19,280
Looks okay.

204
00:14:19,286 --> 00:14:20,332
Mr. Mayor.

205
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:25,311
--Sheriff-- the bomb?
--Yes, ma'am, so far there's no sign
of any radiation.

206
00:14:25,318 --> 00:14:27,493
--We'll keep checking around town.
--No. No, sir.

207
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:31,741
The school bus isn't back from
the field trip with my daughter.

208
00:14:34,215 --> 00:14:36,440
--Well, do something!
--I got it.

209
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,593
--You-You should be out there looking for Stacy.
--Yes, ma'am. Ma'am, Teresa,

210
00:14:39,596 --> 00:14:41,420
this is the first we've heard of it,

211
00:14:41,626 --> 00:14:42,902
but we will deal with it, all right?

212
00:14:42,908 --> 00:14:45,912
--Just please don't worry.
--That's easy for you to say.

213
00:14:46,777 --> 00:14:48,522
You don't have a child out there.

214
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,780
So the school bus was here at the caves.

215
00:15:38,785 --> 00:15:40,853
Now, who can tell me where they might have
gone for repairs?

216
00:15:40,855 --> 00:15:44,473
--Well, there's Wilson's garage off 160.
--Or Cedar Run Road.

217
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:46,411
Principal Movey said they took a detour

218
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,543
before the phone cut out.

219
00:15:47,737 --> 00:15:48,843
Well, I figure two teams.

220
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,510
There's only so many places they could be.

221
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:52,892
--Now, what about the parents?
--Right, right.

222
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:57,872
Folks. Folks! Folks.

223
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:04,581
Now,  look, I know that every part of you
wantsto just rush out there.

224
00:16:04,586 --> 00:16:05,590
I don't blame you.

225
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:09,411
But as your friend, I'm asking you to
think about that.

226
00:16:10,415 --> 00:16:11,463
You're safe here.

227
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,233
Now, what if, God forbid,

228
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:16,592
you go out there, and you get stranded,

229
00:16:16,595 --> 00:16:18,583
and your child comes back an orphan?

230
00:16:19,785 --> 00:16:20,933
You know the sheriff and his men.

231
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:23,701
You know they'll find your kids, so please.

232
00:16:33,656 --> 00:16:34,461
Help!

233
00:16:37,515 --> 00:16:38,412
Mister!

234
00:16:40,827 --> 00:16:42,190
Mister, please!

235
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,061
Mister!

236
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:45,933
What? What is it?

237
00:16:47,277 --> 00:16:48,753
Mister, help!

238
00:16:49,377 --> 00:16:51,101
--Mister, please!
--I think they're...

239
00:16:51,247 --> 00:16:52,521
I think they're dying!

240
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:07,501
That's fine.

241
00:17:14,696 --> 00:17:15,373
Let's go find out.

242
00:17:15,378 --> 00:17:17,860
Jimmy, get over there and calm those folks down.

243
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:20,602
Hey, Pete, come on!

244
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,442
We have our frequencies, sir,

245
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:25,880
but outside, it's like there's no one there.

246
00:17:26,356 --> 00:17:27,292
All right, um...

247
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:28,901
what about analog?

248
00:17:28,907 --> 00:17:31,723
We could contact the governor
with a Ham radio, couldn't we?

249
00:17:31,725 --> 00:17:34,531
That could work, but there's only one in town
that I know of.

250
00:17:35,396 --> 00:17:37,341
I was afraid you were going to say that.

251
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:40,582
Excuse me, Sheriff?

252
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,003
Robert Hawkins.

253
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:43,461
Well, it's good to meet you, Mr. Hawkins,

254
00:17:43,465 --> 00:17:45,191
but as you can see, we've got our hands full.

255
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,522
Could you use an extra man?

256
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:48,192
No civilians, mayor's orders.

257
00:17:48,326 --> 00:17:51,210
But I used to be a cop-- St. Louis.

258
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:55,493
--Do you know the roads around here?
--No, just moved to town.

259
00:17:55,495 --> 00:17:58,351
Then I'm afraid you'd just slow us down,
I'm sorry.

260
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:01,942
You might want to get some black spray paint.

261
00:18:04,287 --> 00:18:06,380
You know, cover that?

262
00:18:07,385 --> 00:18:09,681
Look, I know you're telling people
it was an accident,

263
00:18:10,157 --> 00:18:11,471
and I hope it was,

264
00:18:12,686 --> 00:18:14,790
but if it was an attack, Sheriff,

265
00:18:14,966 --> 00:18:16,480
and there's chaos out there,

266
00:18:17,227 --> 00:18:18,711
you might not want the wrong people knowing

267
00:18:18,717 --> 00:18:20,283
that Jericho is still here.

268
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:24,140
With all due respect, Mr. Hawkins,

269
00:18:24,518 --> 00:18:26,262
this is not St. Louis.

270
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:33,470
--Dad, are you okay?
--Yeah, I'm fine.

271
00:18:33,475 --> 00:18:34,530
Don't worry about me.

272
00:18:35,746 --> 00:18:38,271
Oh, Oliver, would you stop that?

273
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,362
Sorry, Johnston.

274
00:18:42,296 --> 00:18:43,620
Thought you were aliens.

275
00:18:44,098 --> 00:18:47,192
Well, we're under attack by aliens, don't you know?

276
00:18:47,196 --> 00:18:48,593
Yes, we do. That's why we're here.

277
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:52,351
--Do you have your Ham radio?
--Yeah.

278
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:57,001
--For you, 50 cents.
--Oliver.

279
00:18:57,225 --> 00:19:02,760
--Well, I need my 50 cents.
--Okay.

280
00:19:03,905 --> 00:19:05,542
Let me get you change.

281
00:19:09,777 --> 00:19:12,093
Hi, Dale. Sorry I didn't call sooner, Angel

282
00:19:12,095 --> 00:19:14,531
but we decided to stay in the city
an extra couple of days.

283
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:18,303
--Put down the phone and come to bed.
--Honey, stop that. It's my kid.

284
00:19:18,856 --> 00:19:22,162
--Baby, what are you staring at out the window?
--Get over here and look at this!

285
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,223
What-What is that?

286
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,072
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

287
00:19:29,976 --> 00:19:32,113
Hi, Dale. Sorry I didn't call sooner, Angel,

288
00:19:32,115 --> 00:19:34,681
but we decided to stay in the city
an extra couple of days.

289
00:19:34,685 --> 00:19:37,141
--Put down the phone and come to bed.
--Honey...

290
00:19:37,978 --> 00:19:40,493
...but we decided to stay in
the city an extra couple days.

291
00:19:40,495 --> 00:19:42,263
Put down the phone and come to bed.

292
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:45,302
Hon... Hi, Dale. Sorry I didn't call sooner, Angel

293
00:19:45,305 --> 00:19:46,510
but we decided...

294
00:19:46,948 --> 00:19:48,920
Hi, Dale. Sorry I didn't call sooner, Angel

295
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:51,443
but  we decided to stay in
the city an extra couple days.

296
00:19:51,448 --> 00:19:56,510
--Put down the phone and come to bed.
--Honey, stop that. It's my kid. Baby...

297
00:20:06,965 --> 00:20:08,792
--How could we lose power?
--I don't know.

298
00:20:08,797 --> 00:20:09,923
Bomb could have fried the relays.

299
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:11,133
--That's possible.
--Maybe.

300
00:20:11,487 --> 00:20:13,583
They could've blown up the power station for all we know.

301
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:17,753
Guys, it was probably just a drain on
the system from Denver.

302
00:20:19,088 --> 00:20:21,611
You a science teacher?

303
00:20:22,557 --> 00:20:24,612
--Robert Hawkins.
--Chief Carroll.

304
00:20:24,617 --> 00:20:26,231
--Hey.
--Hey.

305
00:20:33,376 --> 00:20:34,851
Jimmy, what's your 20?

306
00:20:35,287 --> 00:20:36,652
Willow Creek, Sheriff.

307
00:20:36,657 --> 00:20:38,492
There is nothing in sight.

308
00:20:47,438 --> 00:20:51,602
The deer went crazy and started running
all over the road.

309
00:20:52,205 --> 00:20:53,751
All right, just don't look at it.

310
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:03,812
Is he alive?

311
00:21:04,645 --> 00:21:05,462
Yeah.

312
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:08,931
--Are you okay?
--Yeah.

313
00:21:08,938 --> 00:21:11,512
I think my leg is broken.

314
00:21:11,977 --> 00:21:14,482
--Can you feel your toes?
--Yeah.

315
00:21:15,535 --> 00:21:16,822
Don't worry about me.

316
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:18,253
Worry about them.

317
00:21:20,518 --> 00:21:21,643
Is anybody hurt?

318
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,223
Huh? Anybody?

319
00:21:24,507 --> 00:21:25,672
Stacy's sick.

320
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:27,201
She can't breathe.

321
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,182
What's wrong?

322
00:21:33,616 --> 00:21:34,772
What happened?

323
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:35,692
When the bus stopped,

324
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:36,780
she was like this.

325
00:21:39,086 --> 00:21:40,422
It's okay, Stacy, let me see.

326
00:21:40,705 --> 00:21:41,481
Let me see it?

327
00:21:43,438 --> 00:21:44,370
Can I see?

328
00:21:44,508 --> 00:21:45,222
Let me just see, Stacy.

329
00:21:45,398 --> 00:21:47,293
It's okay. It's okay.

330
00:21:49,657 --> 00:21:50,931
Do you have an ice pack?

331
00:21:51,087 --> 00:21:52,793
We've got to stop the swelling now.

332
00:21:53,506 --> 00:21:56,221
Lucas, the first aid kit is under the seat.

333
00:21:57,035 --> 00:21:57,811
You're okay.

334
00:21:58,555 --> 00:22:00,613
Come on, it's all right.

335
00:22:00,645 --> 00:22:01,351
Just keep breathing.

336
00:22:01,447 --> 00:22:02,722
Breathe normally, all right?

337
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,930
It's okay. It's okay, you're fine.

338
00:22:04,937 --> 00:22:06,251
Just keep breathing normally.

339
00:22:08,988 --> 00:22:10,361
Okay, you're okay.

340
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:11,723
You're okay.

341
00:22:13,857 --> 00:22:14,783
Please.

342
00:22:15,676 --> 00:22:17,692
Calm down, calm down.

343
00:22:18,106 --> 00:22:20,532
Hey? Hey, Stacy?

344
00:22:20,777 --> 00:22:22,730
No, no, no. No.

345
00:22:43,468 --> 00:22:45,800
Think. Think.

346
00:22:45,977 --> 00:22:46,902
Think.

347
00:22:48,788 --> 00:22:49,603
All right.

348
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:50,711
Look, I need everyone's help right now.

349
00:22:50,716 --> 00:22:51,612
Who has a pen?

350
00:22:51,616 --> 00:22:52,283
Does anyone?

351
00:22:53,575 --> 00:22:54,521
Does anybody have a pen?

352
00:22:54,528 --> 00:22:55,730
All right, I need a pen.

353
00:22:55,738 --> 00:22:57,960
--We have pencils.
--No, I need a tube.

354
00:22:57,965 --> 00:22:59,183
Something hollow, um...

355
00:22:59,185 --> 00:23:00,081
A straw.

356
00:23:00,177 --> 00:23:01,463
--I have a straw.
--Here, let me see it.

357
00:23:01,466 --> 00:23:02,433
Let me see it, come on.

358
00:23:03,517 --> 00:23:04,491
That's too thin.

359
00:23:04,746 --> 00:23:06,301
Does anyone else have a juice box?

360
00:23:06,267 --> 00:23:07,381
--I do!
--All right, get them out, get them out.

361
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:08,323
Get some Band-Aids out.

362
00:23:08,328 --> 00:23:09,333
--What's your name?
--Julie.

363
00:23:09,335 --> 00:23:10,730
All right, everybody give your straws to Julie.

364
00:23:10,735 --> 00:23:12,183
Okay? Hurry, quick.

365
00:23:12,495 --> 00:23:13,663
Make them into a circle.

366
00:23:14,618 --> 00:23:15,820
All right, you got that?

367
00:23:16,785 --> 00:23:19,031
There you go, now tape them
together with those Band-Aids.

368
00:23:20,646 --> 00:23:21,850
Come on, Stacy.

369
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,530
All right, who's the strongest kid?

370
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,201
You. I need you to hold her shoulders down,

371
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,221
in case she wakes up. All right?

372
00:23:31,897 --> 00:23:32,903
Don't look.

373
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,423
Where's my straws?

374
00:23:56,495 --> 00:23:57,472
Come on, come on.

375
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:03,312
Breathe for me, okay? Please?

376
00:24:03,638 --> 00:24:04,872
Come on. Come on.

377
00:24:41,027 --> 00:24:42,502
Wait,  I see something.

378
00:24:42,956 --> 00:24:46,352
--Okay, okay, we see the bus.
--Uh, good.

379
00:24:46,357 --> 00:24:49,552
--You want us?
--No, no, you keep looking for Jake.

380
00:24:54,865 --> 00:24:56,313
Let's get down there, boys.

381
00:25:00,176 --> 00:25:02,270
How'd you learn how to do that?

382
00:25:02,985 --> 00:25:04,933
Uh, military school.

383
00:25:05,846 --> 00:25:07,690
Were you a soldier?

384
00:25:09,457 --> 00:25:11,361
No, a screw up.

385
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:35,220
Sheriff.

386
00:25:35,688 --> 00:25:36,732
Sheriff, look at this.

387
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:38,412
It's the wrong bus!

388
00:25:38,415 --> 00:25:40,913
Riley, Riley get over here!

389
00:25:41,655 --> 00:25:42,703
Riley!

390
00:25:52,905 --> 00:25:54,193
Oh, great.

391
00:25:54,357 --> 00:25:56,263
Where's the damn rescue party?

392
00:25:57,787 --> 00:25:59,220
Oh, hi, Dale.

393
00:25:59,846 --> 00:26:01,342
Come on in, honey.

394
00:26:01,347 --> 00:26:03,993
Come on, we're all trying
to get through this together.

395
00:26:07,425 --> 00:26:08,512
Hi, Dale.

396
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:10,852
You okay, honey?

397
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:14,602
What you got there?

398
00:26:17,918 --> 00:26:18,961
It's my mom.

399
00:26:20,825 --> 00:26:23,290
Hi, Dale, sorry I didn't call sooner, Angel

400
00:26:23,296 --> 00:26:25,820
but we decided to stay in the
city an extra couple days.

401
00:26:25,827 --> 00:26:29,211
--Put down the phone and come to bed.
--Honey, stop that, it's my kid.

402
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:31,801
Baby, what are you staring at out the window?

403
00:26:31,806 --> 00:26:33,290
Get over here and look at this!

404
00:26:33,728 --> 00:26:35,291
What, what is that?

405
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:37,983
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

406
00:26:46,877 --> 00:26:49,093
Oh, Dale, I am so sorry.

407
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:51,621
I didn't know your mother was in Denver.

408
00:26:53,395 --> 00:26:54,643
She wasn't in Denver.

409
00:26:55,755 --> 00:26:56,611
She was in Atlanta.

410
00:26:57,267 --> 00:26:59,293
Oh, my God.

411
00:27:05,235 --> 00:27:07,760
I'm sure that they'll have some answers.

412
00:27:10,075 --> 00:27:11,071
Oh, my God.

413
00:27:16,186 --> 00:27:17,042
How is she?

414
00:27:17,145 --> 00:27:18,543
We have to get her back.

415
00:27:32,107 --> 00:27:33,361
Right here. Right here.

416
00:27:35,016 --> 00:27:38,980
Miss Lisinski, are we going to
have school tomorrow?

417
00:27:40,396 --> 00:27:41,790
We'll figure it out, honey.

418
00:27:42,697 --> 00:27:43,793
I vote no.

419
00:27:50,576 --> 00:27:52,832
Dale, Dale, what are you doing, honey?

420
00:27:53,458 --> 00:27:55,440
Please, please don't steal from me.

421
00:27:55,746 --> 00:27:56,640
Dale!

422
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:01,681
--Ready?
--Yeah, yeah.

423
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:03,893
Hey, you got extra there?

424
00:28:03,896 --> 00:28:05,312
First come, first serve.

425
00:28:06,455 --> 00:28:07,973
You filled up your truck, you
going to mow your lawn, too?

426
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,292
--I've got a family, you know?
--We've all got families.

427
00:28:10,298 --> 00:28:10,873
Come on.

428
00:28:11,776 --> 00:28:12,933
Get your hand off the can.

429
00:28:13,757 --> 00:28:14,611
Come on.

430
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:16,770
What do you think you're doing, hmm?

431
00:28:17,248 --> 00:28:18,402
--What are you doing?
--What's your problem?

432
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:22,161
All right, everybody sit down.

433
00:28:37,747 --> 00:28:38,642
Hurry.

434
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:51,400
Food won't go rotten as long
as the weather stays cool.

435
00:28:51,758 --> 00:28:53,743
Hopefully the power will be fixed by then.

436
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:56,083
Thank you for this, Dale.

437
00:28:57,768 --> 00:28:59,043
Anything for you, ma'am.

438
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:07,482
--Step away from the car.
--Get out of the car.

439
00:29:09,305 --> 00:29:11,402
--Hey, hey, hey, hey, come on,
--break it up.

440
00:29:11,408 --> 00:29:13,220
Get off.

441
00:29:13,228 --> 00:29:14,610
You need to get some lights on

442
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:16,882
before people start losing it.

443
00:29:16,885 --> 00:29:18,642
All we have is lanterns and flashlights.

444
00:29:18,645 --> 00:29:20,510
That's not enough to light up
the street though.

445
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:23,543
But your town does roadwork at night, right?

446
00:29:27,905 --> 00:29:28,763
Excuse me.

447
00:29:30,405 --> 00:29:33,343
--The machine doesn't work.
--Well, you guys have to pay cash or something!

448
00:29:40,996 --> 00:29:42,583
You sure you're not the science teacher?

449
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:45,672
Chief, we got a little problem
down here at the gas station.

450
00:29:45,675 --> 00:29:47,153
We need your help right away.

451
00:29:48,566 --> 00:29:50,360
--I'm on my way.
--I got this.

452
00:29:50,495 --> 00:29:52,640
--I'll come with you.
--All right, thanks.

453
00:29:53,615 --> 00:29:54,353
Sir.

454
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:56,370
Something's going on at the gas station.

455
00:29:56,555 --> 00:29:57,101
Big crowd.

456
00:29:57,225 --> 00:29:58,233
Looks like trouble.

457
00:29:58,748 --> 00:29:59,832
Gonna need help down here.

458
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,050
--Dad.
--I heard.

459
00:30:02,058 --> 00:30:03,112
Go, go.

460
00:30:05,665 --> 00:30:06,803
--Sara?
--It's okay.

461
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:07,602
Honey?

462
00:30:07,918 --> 00:30:09,380
I don't have time right now.

463
00:30:09,385 --> 00:30:10,901
--Some damn fool...
--Johnston.

464
00:30:10,906 --> 00:30:12,770
--What?
--Listen to me.

465
00:30:13,947 --> 00:30:17,882
Dale Turner's mother died
tonight in another explosion.

466
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:21,901
Atlanta.

467
00:30:24,465 --> 00:30:25,793
Oh, my God.

468
00:30:47,465 --> 00:30:48,321
Sheriff?

469
00:30:48,487 --> 00:30:49,590
Yeah, there's no sign of Jake out here

470
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,120
in fact, there's, uh, no sign of anybody.

471
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:53,303
We're going to,

472
00:30:53,308 --> 00:30:54,400
we're going to head back.

473
00:30:54,825 --> 00:30:56,693
Let me know if the kids need anything

474
00:30:57,025 --> 00:30:57,921
Sheriff, you there?

475
00:30:59,217 --> 00:31:00,340
Stay awake.

476
00:31:01,136 --> 00:31:02,610
Stay awake, don't--

477
00:31:06,685 --> 00:31:08,523
Does this bus have a gas can?

478
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,210
If the bus...

479
00:31:15,885 --> 00:31:17,213
If it stops...

480
00:31:18,455 --> 00:31:19,270
Okay.

481
00:31:22,928 --> 00:31:24,682
Kids, listen to me.

482
00:31:26,478 --> 00:31:28,012
If the bus stops again,

483
00:31:28,836 --> 00:31:31,792
we're going to need you to walk back to town

484
00:31:32,236 --> 00:31:34,180
and get help, okay?

485
00:31:35,055 --> 00:31:36,533
I don't know where we are.

486
00:31:37,238 --> 00:31:38,532
When we get to the stop sign,

487
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:40,322
turn left, all right?

488
00:31:40,326 --> 00:31:41,182
Take a left.

489
00:31:42,016 --> 00:31:43,182
Which way is left?

490
00:31:45,255 --> 00:31:46,852
Hold up your hands...

491
00:31:48,688 --> 00:31:50,013
stick out your thumbs.

492
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,331
The one that makes the L,

493
00:31:54,115 --> 00:31:55,403
that's your left.

494
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:09,950
Get your hands off me!

495
00:32:17,376 --> 00:32:18,583
Do something, will you?

496
00:32:21,935 --> 00:32:23,881
County Edwards! Carl! Carl!

497
00:32:27,377 --> 00:32:28,961
Stop it right now!

498
00:32:30,018 --> 00:32:32,282
Yeah, Morty, I'm talking to you!

499
00:32:34,796 --> 00:32:35,913
Michael Stevenson.

500
00:32:36,775 --> 00:32:38,333
Carl Meeks... Carl!

501
00:32:40,847 --> 00:32:42,791
Why are you turning on each other?

502
00:32:43,418 --> 00:32:45,402
Stealing from your neighbors?

503
00:32:46,455 --> 00:32:48,711
You are fighting the wrong people!

504
00:32:50,087 --> 00:32:52,181
We are literally in the dark.

505
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:57,920
All I'm saying is that I-I think
we need to get organized.

506
00:32:58,437 --> 00:32:59,253
I...

507
00:33:01,596 --> 00:33:03,152
I don't know where the mayor is,

508
00:33:03,626 --> 00:33:06,093
but maybe it's time we came up
with a plan ourselves.

509
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:06,770
What's going on, Gray?

510
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:07,943
We making speeches?

511
00:33:08,915 --> 00:33:11,293
With all due respect, Mr. Mayor

512
00:33:11,296 --> 00:33:12,333
we have a missing bus,

513
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:13,582
no police,

514
00:33:13,936 --> 00:33:15,960
firemen doing policemen's job.

515
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:17,520
--How dare you politicize it!
--Eric. Eric.

516
00:33:17,525 --> 00:33:19,000
I'm not talking to my opponent

517
00:33:19,008 --> 00:33:20,640
I'm talking to my mayor.

518
00:33:21,045 --> 00:33:22,300
Now, I don't care about the election

519
00:33:22,305 --> 00:33:23,473
I care about survival.

520
00:33:23,475 --> 00:33:25,161
We just might be on our own here,

521
00:33:25,316 --> 00:33:28,042
and I need to know what my mayor intends to do!

522
00:33:29,365 --> 00:33:31,503
Folks, I know we've been through a lot tonight.

523
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:32,943
I want to tell you something.

524
00:33:32,948 --> 00:33:34,190
I've been to big cities and

525
00:33:34,196 --> 00:33:35,232
I've been to foreign countries,

526
00:33:35,238 --> 00:33:38,513
--but I will take the good people of--
--The good people of Jericho
over any other city

527
00:33:38,515 --> 00:33:40,471
we know, Mr. Mayor, we've heard the speech.

528
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:41,691
Well, Shep, I hope you don't think

529
00:33:41,695 --> 00:33:43,371
I've been asleep at the switch.

530
00:33:43,845 --> 00:33:46,802
We had all hoped this was an accident

531
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:49,061
but the unfortunate truth is

532
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,900
there was another explosion in Atlanta.

533
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:52,270
--What?
--Oh, my God.

534
00:33:52,596 --> 00:33:56,532
--I been busy trying to contact the governor.
--Yeah? Well, what if the governor's dead?

535
00:33:56,537 --> 00:33:59,930
There is no report of anything happening in Topeka.

536
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,922
--How are we going to get reports
without television?
--Or no phones?

537
00:34:02,256 --> 00:34:03,302
What about New York?

538
00:34:03,305 --> 00:34:06,503
--We don't know anything about New York.
--When are we going to get the power back on?

539
00:34:06,265 --> 00:34:08,620
--Is the drinking water okay?
--One at a time, please.

540
00:34:08,987 --> 00:34:11,723
--Calm down.
--Calm down? My boy is still out there.

541
00:34:11,726 --> 00:34:13,072
The sheriff is out there right now

542
00:34:13,077 --> 00:34:15,143
looking for your boy and my boy.

543
00:34:15,147 --> 00:34:17,403
What if we had more police officers out there?

544
00:34:17,065 --> 00:34:19,413
--We need to know what you're going to do now.
--No one can answer that.

545
00:34:38,466 --> 00:34:40,963
Help them! Help them!

546
00:34:41,218 --> 00:34:42,101
It's Stacy.

547
00:34:43,466 --> 00:34:44,793
Hey, there, little one.

548
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:47,720
--You're okay.
--I got you.

549
00:34:50,068 --> 00:34:51,112
What's your name?

550
00:34:51,706 --> 00:34:54,070
--Heather.
--Jake.

551
00:34:55,916 --> 00:35:01,252
--Nice to meet you, Jake.
--You, too.

552
00:35:01,748 --> 00:35:02,562
Mommy!

553
00:35:03,287 --> 00:35:05,452
--I missed you so much.
--I love you.

554
00:35:12,748 --> 00:35:13,760
Hey, Buddy.

555
00:35:14,107 --> 00:35:16,403
Dad, there was this deer...

556
00:35:19,478 --> 00:35:20,650
Mommy's right here.

557
00:35:20,797 --> 00:35:21,843
I'm right here, honey.

558
00:35:22,357 --> 00:35:23,713
Everything's going to be okay.

559
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,860
--Jake.
--Mom.

560
00:35:29,187 --> 00:35:31,813
--Oh, your face.
--I'll be all right.

561
00:35:31,817 --> 00:35:33,151
--Oh, honey.
--You okay?

562
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:34,490
Of course.

563
00:35:35,156 --> 00:35:36,563
Eric, help your brother.

564
00:35:42,255 --> 00:35:45,573
--Put your arm around me.
--Careful. Careful.

565
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:51,490
Easy. Easy.

566
00:35:52,405 --> 00:35:53,183
Okay.

567
00:35:53,495 --> 00:35:56,081
--Eric, get April.
We'll meet you the medical center.
--Okay.

568
00:35:56,085 --> 00:35:58,773
Hey, hey, there's an empty
prison bus out there.

569
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:01,091
--Whereabouts?
--Cedar Run.

570
00:36:01,365 --> 00:36:02,061
All right, just relax.

571
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:03,113
I'll take care of it.

572
00:36:03,877 --> 00:36:07,362
--God! Look at you. You're a mess.
--It's fine.

573
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:10,173
--Stop worrying about me.
--Well, good luck with that.

574
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:19,930
Hey, Shep?

575
00:36:22,707 --> 00:36:25,390
You said earlier that you had
heard that speech before.

576
00:36:26,408 --> 00:36:28,502
Ever ask yourself why I say it?

577
00:36:29,955 --> 00:36:31,362
'Cause I happen to trust you people.

578
00:36:33,718 --> 00:36:34,842
'Cause I love my town.

579
00:36:36,288 --> 00:36:38,691
Now, something happened in Denver, in Atlanta,

580
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:41,292
and it could be that we wake up

581
00:36:41,415 --> 00:36:43,123
and we find out that's where it stopped.

582
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:44,623
But, until we know,

583
00:36:45,796 --> 00:36:48,270
are we going to use our imaginations
to solve problems

584
00:36:48,278 --> 00:36:49,560
or to cause them?

585
00:36:53,198 --> 00:36:55,722
We can find out how big this thing is.

586
00:36:56,588 --> 00:36:58,340
If we have to, we can fight.

587
00:36:58,348 --> 00:36:59,203
We can fight anybody.

588
00:36:59,338 --> 00:37:01,002
We can fight all enemies.

589
00:37:02,448 --> 00:37:04,310
The only way that's going to happen

590
00:37:04,316 --> 00:37:05,953
is if we work together.

591
00:37:08,307 --> 00:37:09,270
Now, go on home.

592
00:37:10,638 --> 00:37:13,470
We'll meet tomorrow at the town hall.

593
00:37:15,735 --> 00:37:16,592
And, folks,

594
00:37:19,326 --> 00:37:21,232
don't you break my heart again.

595
00:37:25,658 --> 00:37:32,271
Chief, keep all the men at their posts
until the sheriff gets back.
Hey, Shep.

596
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:40,133
I was afraid I was never going
to see you again.

597
00:37:42,047 --> 00:37:44,612
Come on. You think I'd
let Dad have the last word?

598
00:37:45,548 --> 00:37:46,400
Hey.

599
00:37:47,155 --> 00:37:48,331
Quit talking about me.

600
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:54,672
You did a great thing out there tonight.

601
00:37:56,756 --> 00:37:57,811
Thanks.

602
00:38:02,846 --> 00:38:04,600
Your grandfather would have been proud.

603
00:38:11,965 --> 00:38:14,170
I'm going to go see what's
taking these guys so long.

604
00:38:20,736 --> 00:38:22,473
You know, I go away for a few years

605
00:38:22,477 --> 00:38:24,193
and the town goes to hell.

606
00:38:30,076 --> 00:38:31,552
I'm glad you're home.

607
00:38:33,548 --> 00:38:34,630
Yeah, we'll see.

608
00:38:46,097 --> 00:38:46,913
What are you thinking?

609
00:38:47,885 --> 00:38:50,643
I was just wondering what it was all going
to look like in the morning.

610
00:39:19,047 --> 00:39:24,421
(I'll sing it one last time for you)

611
00:39:25,828 --> 00:39:30,382
(Then we really have to go)

612
00:39:31,876 --> 00:39:36,703
(You've been the only thing that's right)

613
00:39:38,155 --> 00:39:40,783
(In all I've done...)

614
00:39:40,485 --> 00:39:41,420
What's happening?

615
00:39:46,526 --> 00:39:49,291
(Light up, light up)

616
00:39:50,277 --> 00:39:55,222
(As if you have a choice)

617
00:39:55,576 --> 00:39:58,332
(even if you cannot hear... )

618
00:39:56,336 --> 00:39:58,511
