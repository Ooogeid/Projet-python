1
00:00:00,243 --> 00:00:01,590
<i>Previously on Jericho</i>

2
00:00:02,241 --> 00:00:03,542
Some of them were on planes

3
00:00:03,668 --> 00:00:05,228
that landed in
the middle of nowhere.

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,999
They've been walking for weeks.

5
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,080
They must have gone
through hell.

6
00:00:09,408 --> 00:00:12,100
Oh, my God.
Roger.

7
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:15,406
There's a woman in that
group of refugees that

8
00:00:15,407 --> 00:00:16,661
Bill is processing.

9
00:00:16,662 --> 00:00:17,925
I think you should talk to her.

10
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:19,482
Hello, Rob.

11
00:00:19,483 --> 00:00:21,662
Someone on my team
sold us all out.

12
00:00:21,663 --> 00:00:24,875
You're smart enough to know that they
would say anything to get you to talk.

13
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,729
At current levels of consumption,

14
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,899
we will be completely
out of gas and diesel in two weeks.

15
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,334
We can live without
power for now,

16
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:36,055
but we won't see spring
if we don't eat.

17
00:00:36,056 --> 00:00:37,400
All right, look,
the further out you get,

18
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:38,599
the hairier the roads are,

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,064
and food being
as scarce as it is,

20
00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:41,625
there's bound to be
trouble out there.

21
00:00:41,626 --> 00:00:43,072
Why are they following us?

22
00:00:43,194 --> 00:00:44,264
Stanley, hold on!

23
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:50,139
Jake!
It's Mom and Dad, honey!

24
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:51,605
You're going to be all right.

25
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:54,498
So, I'm being watched?

26
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,899
It's the Old Man.

27
00:00:56,177 --> 00:00:58,183
He's coming for us,
using us against each other.

28
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,749
If they kill me,
they will never find the package.

29
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:03,411
I have something
in my possession,

30
00:01:03,412 --> 00:01:05,187
and there's people
out there that want it.

31
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:08,200
And that puts you, me
and the kids in danger here.

32
00:01:08,331 --> 00:01:09,623
Then listen to me...

33
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,533
Sarah is not on our side.

34
00:01:11,687 --> 00:01:14,099
I'm telling you, Robert,
she's not here to help us.

35
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:16,548
Hawkins is starting to put
the pieces together.

36
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:17,938
He needs to be eliminated.

37
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,311
- I know.
- Why are you stalling on this one?

38
00:01:25,578 --> 00:01:27,681
Because this one is different.

39
00:01:39,676 --> 00:01:42,002
You won't make it out of Kansas
with the fuel you've got,

40
00:01:42,003 --> 00:01:43,734
and you're not going to find
another drop out there.

41
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:47,352
The folks who left last week
are probably in Arizona by now.

42
00:01:47,418 --> 00:01:49,149
If they weren't
murdered on the highway.

43
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,052
It is suicide to leave, Ridley.

44
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:53,985
There's no food, no heat.

45
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:56,084
It's suicide if we stay.

46
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:02,959
This... this is everything.

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,210
I mean, it's every farm.

48
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,041
At least until the spring crops come in,
and that could take months.

49
00:02:08,566 --> 00:02:10,202
And what if we don't
factor in the refugees?

50
00:02:10,203 --> 00:02:11,763
They're a part of this town now.

51
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:13,400
A lot of extra mouths to feed.

52
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:14,713
They've done their part, Gray.

53
00:02:14,852 --> 00:02:16,365
They've helped hunt,
cut firewood...

54
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:19,533
Resources they use up five times
faster than they supply them.

55
00:02:19,534 --> 00:02:21,014
When the windmills come in
from New Bern,

56
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,468
most of our fuel issues
will be solved.

57
00:02:22,469 --> 00:02:24,028
What about every day until then?

58
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:26,593
Ridley and his group
are about to leave.

59
00:02:26,995 --> 00:02:29,419
If people want to try and make it
on their own, that's their right.

60
00:02:29,437 --> 00:02:31,317
You know as well as I do that
come springtime,

61
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,866
we'll find their bodies out there.

62
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,772
Well, what do you want me to do,
Johnston?

63
00:02:34,773 --> 00:02:36,665
Wh-What am I missing
that's not on that board?

64
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,402
You find it for me,
'cause I don't see it.

65
00:02:38,403 --> 00:02:41,469
Without some "X" factor,

66
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,352
we're not going to make it
through the winter.

67
00:02:43,353 --> 00:02:44,711
Not all of us.

68
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:49,727
We have to make
some hard decisions.

69
00:02:52,641 --> 00:02:55,785
And I think the last ones in
should be the first ones to go.

70
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:14,287
Clear the streets!

71
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,586
We need to clear the streets!

72
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:12,600
Who's in charge here?

73
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:16,350
I'm Gray Anderson.

74
00:04:16,581 --> 00:04:18,009
I'm the mayor of Jericho.

75
00:04:18,818 --> 00:04:20,275
Glad to meet you,
Mayor Anderson.

76
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,194
I'm Gunnery Sergeant Hill.
Fourth MAR-DIV,

77
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:24,162
Fourth Tank Battalion,
Charlie Company.

78
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,590
So you're...?

79
00:04:25,783 --> 00:04:26,810
Sir,

80
00:04:27,288 --> 00:04:30,027
we're the United States Marines,
and we're here to help.

85
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,996
They sent the marines?

86
00:04:51,837 --> 00:04:54,831
We were deployed to Western Kansas
to set up a firm base

87
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:59,022
and prep the outlying towns for the
arrival of the Army Corps of Engineers.

88
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,237
Now that we've won the war,
it's time to start rebuilding.

89
00:05:02,328 --> 00:05:03,551
War? What war?

90
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,729
- You didn't hear?
- No.

91
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:10,155
We lost all communications
after the EMP.

92
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:13,519
Well, we nuked the hell
out of North Korea and Iran.

93
00:05:15,977 --> 00:05:17,060
So they were behind it?

94
00:05:17,264 --> 00:05:19,572
From what I hear, which isn't much,
Iran financed it,

95
00:05:19,573 --> 00:05:21,509
North Korea supplied the bombs.

96
00:05:21,684 --> 00:05:23,899
We've got troops all over the world
going after the...

97
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,538
terrorists who snuck them in,

98
00:05:25,556 --> 00:05:27,452
but at least we took
out the big dogs.

99
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:28,752
What happens now?

100
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:31,455
Largest reconstruction effort
in the history of the country.

101
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,479
So there's somebody
finally in charge?

102
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:35,675
The former secretary of HHS
is now the president.

103
00:05:35,676 --> 00:05:37,179
We heard there
were six guys

104
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,495
from six different capitals
claiming to be president.

105
00:05:39,566 --> 00:05:40,591
Resolved.

106
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,984
The federal government
is reunifying in Columbus, Ohio.

107
00:05:42,996 --> 00:05:44,544
How did they
decide on Columbus?

108
00:05:44,592 --> 00:05:45,992
All I know is, my orders are coming

109
00:05:45,993 --> 00:05:48,186
from the commanding officer
of the Fourth Battalion,

110
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:50,069
and
those are to restore lights,

111
00:05:50,455 --> 00:05:53,796
power and infrastructure
to Kansas, one town at a time.

112
00:05:57,935 --> 00:06:00,362
W- Wait, wait.
When is that going to happen?

113
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:03,645
Should have your shelves full of Oreos
and Hot Pockets by the end of the year.

114
00:06:06,604 --> 00:06:08,627
Welcome back to the grid, Jericho.

115
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,910
Thank God for
the US Marines.

116
00:06:21,467 --> 00:06:22,889
Hey! Hey! It's over.

117
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,955
There are kids out here.
Get a room.

118
00:06:34,587 --> 00:06:37,397
Come on. We should have been
on the road yesterday.

119
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,119
Well, I'm packed.

120
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,668
Hi. We're all fueled up.

121
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:47,037
How are we doing?

122
00:06:47,383 --> 00:06:49,453
We'll be ready when we're ready.

123
00:06:52,674 --> 00:06:55,425
I'll get the rest of my things
from downstairs.

124
00:06:57,425 --> 00:07:00,119
How many more times
are we going to have to move?

125
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:02,662
- This should do it.
- Really?

126
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,344
You're going to stay in
one place from now on?

127
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,031
Sergeant Green. Marine Corps?

128
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:12,781
Ah, hell, no.
Army Rangers.

129
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:15,146
Well, I'll try not to hold it
against you.

130
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:18,181
Listen, Gunny, how long
before the engineers get here?

131
00:07:18,363 --> 00:07:20,244
Could be two days,
could be two weeks.

132
00:07:20,255 --> 00:07:22,613
In the meantime, why don't you get
a wish list of what you need,

133
00:07:22,614 --> 00:07:25,254
and I'll forward that on to Battalion
Headquarters in Dodge City,

134
00:07:25,255 --> 00:07:27,781
and we'll start to get y'all back on
your feet.  - Roger that.

135
00:07:28,492 --> 00:07:30,022
Just tell me how
I can be of service.

136
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,099
Going to need
a command post.

137
00:07:32,153 --> 00:07:33,706
- Use the sheriff's office.
- Great.

138
00:07:34,146 --> 00:07:35,162
Excuse me.

139
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:38,262
If you guys are going
to be here for a while,

140
00:07:38,263 --> 00:07:40,279
why don't I take your men
over to my tavern.

141
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:42,538
Thanks, ma'am,
my troops could use it.

142
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:44,438
Wymore!
Front and center!

143
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:46,038
Move it, move it!

144
00:07:46,538 --> 00:07:48,321
Muster up and follow
this young lady here.

145
00:07:48,322 --> 00:07:50,162
The liberty call is
sounded, but remember...

146
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:52,062
conduct yourselves like marines.
- Aye Sir.

147
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,854
Don't you "sir" me, PFC.

148
00:07:53,987 --> 00:07:55,637
I work for a living.
Dismissed!

149
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,870
Aye, aye, Gunnery Sergeant.

150
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:02,291
Couple of months ago, I would have had
that kid doing push-ups till he puked,

151
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:03,874
but, uh, they've
been through a lot.

152
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:06,207
I understand.
Anything else we can do?

153
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:09,382
Well, Sergeant, uh...
one other thing.

154
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:10,916
Corporal Mullin!

155
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,324
Hi. Uh, I'm looking to scavenge
some replacement parts.

156
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:16,690
Our radio, well, it took
a couple of pretty good hits.

157
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:18,382
Do you have any idea
where I could start?

158
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,615
Maybe I could help.

159
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,974
Oh, Lance Corporal Mullin.

160
00:08:20,975 --> 00:08:22,390
- Jake.
- Maggie.

161
00:08:22,857 --> 00:08:24,723
So you're the town's
electronics expert?

162
00:08:24,907 --> 00:08:26,457
No, I'm not an expert
at anything.

163
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,557
- But I can improvise.
- I'll take that.

164
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,390
We'll see what
we can find.

165
00:08:45,242 --> 00:08:46,259
So, uh...

166
00:08:47,715 --> 00:08:48,765
I've been thinking...

167
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:51,992
Maybe leaving my family...

168
00:08:52,692 --> 00:08:53,976
isn't such a good idea.

169
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:55,725
What?

170
00:08:56,742 --> 00:08:57,942
Why?
We've been over this.

171
00:08:57,975 --> 00:08:59,658
They-they're not safe
here with you.

172
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:00,725
I know.

173
00:09:01,058 --> 00:09:02,791
There are people out there
who would...

174
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,508
hurt them in order to get to me.

175
00:09:05,782 --> 00:09:07,357
But at least I understand
the dangers.

176
00:09:07,358 --> 00:09:08,390
I can protect them.

177
00:09:08,619 --> 00:09:09,782
You're not thinking straight.

178
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,149
This is my family, Sarah.

179
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:13,033
It never mattered before.

180
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:14,799
Now it does.

181
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:18,499
What's it going to take...

182
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,924
someone slitting your wife's throat
before you get it ?

183
00:09:27,075 --> 00:09:28,084
You're right.

184
00:09:31,042 --> 00:09:33,059
We will drop them
at the safe house,

185
00:09:33,775 --> 00:09:35,275
and then we'll keep moving.

186
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:38,075
It's the right thing for them.

187
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:05,542
I just realized...
Hmm?

188
00:10:06,175 --> 00:10:08,183
If the government
is up and running,

189
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,383
you know what that means, right?
- No

190
00:10:10,524 --> 00:10:11,524
Paperwork.

191
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:13,474
They'll need
accountants again.

192
00:10:13,475 --> 00:10:14,808
Does that mean I'm back in debt?

193
00:10:14,824 --> 00:10:17,008
Don't be so negative.
New York made it.

194
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:19,099
Come next summer,

195
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,413
I'll be taking walks
though Central Park.

196
00:10:22,113 --> 00:10:23,121
What?

197
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:25,246
Dude!
This is awesome!

198
00:10:25,247 --> 00:10:27,170
I could totally
be a marine.

199
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,648
I could totally see that happening...

200
00:10:29,864 --> 00:10:31,664
Except for everything about you.

201
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:41,367
God, I...

202
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:42,625
Don't worry about her.

203
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:44,442
It's a phase, trust me.

204
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:46,858
The minute everything
calms down,

205
00:10:46,859 --> 00:10:48,008
he's as good as gone.

206
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,732
Yeah, yeah, maybe
you can give him a ride

207
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,258
out of town
on the way to New York.

208
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,925
Thinking about leaving
this town is not

209
00:10:54,926 --> 00:10:57,525
the same thing as thinking
about leaving you.

210
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:58,542
No?

211
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:02,133
Well, it adds up to
the same thing, Mimi.

212
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:05,760
Maybe you could
come with me.

213
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:09,876
Yeah, I'm-I'm sorry.
That's not my life.

214
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,610
Well, this isn't mine.

215
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,513
I've missed you.

216
00:11:32,196 --> 00:11:33,196
Me, too.

217
00:11:37,242 --> 00:11:38,359
We should get going.

218
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:43,394
Start loading up
the truck, huh?

219
00:11:46,778 --> 00:11:48,028
Go on, get out of here.

220
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:25,892
I heard what happened.
Are you okay?

221
00:12:25,942 --> 00:12:27,575
Yeah, I'm better than the truck.

222
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:31,225
Be able to quit worrying about you
one of these days, right?

223
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,366
Hey, Jake.
Amazing, huh?

224
00:12:34,745 --> 00:12:35,995
Yeah, it's great news.

225
00:12:37,462 --> 00:12:38,528
I'll see you later.

226
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:44,013
How are most of
the towns out there?

227
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,242
Let's just say
I haven't seen

228
00:12:46,243 --> 00:12:48,292
anything like this
since we entered the CZ.

229
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:49,509
"CZ"?

230
00:12:49,892 --> 00:12:51,075
Contamination Zone.

231
00:12:51,076 --> 00:12:52,413
You're in CZ-12,

232
00:12:52,663 --> 00:12:54,304
and you're better
off than most.

233
00:12:54,429 --> 00:12:55,529
That's hard to imagine.

234
00:12:55,621 --> 00:12:58,054
Try taking a walk through what's
left of Lawrence, Kansas.

235
00:12:58,171 --> 00:12:59,179
What's it like?

236
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,156
Buildings
are all gone.

237
00:13:01,256 --> 00:13:03,373
People who are left are
fighting their neighbors

238
00:13:03,374 --> 00:13:04,456
for food and water.

239
00:13:05,532 --> 00:13:08,529
Makes you wonder if the
survivors are the lucky ones.

240
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:17,151
We need a transistor
for their radio.

241
00:13:17,218 --> 00:13:18,735
Can we take
apart the jukebox?

242
00:13:18,751 --> 00:13:20,685
Oh, you're going to take
my music?

243
00:13:21,118 --> 00:13:23,051
Isn't there anything else
you can take apart?

244
00:13:23,117 --> 00:13:25,692
You've got three
Spin Doctors albums on here.

245
00:13:26,054 --> 00:13:27,837
Trust me, it's a public service.

246
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,208
Don't worry, there's an old
ham radio in City Hall.

247
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:32,824
Maybe we can take that apart.

248
00:13:33,349 --> 00:13:34,682
- Thanks anyway.
- Bye.

249
00:13:37,643 --> 00:13:38,643
Oh, hey, big guy.

250
00:13:40,126 --> 00:13:41,826
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

251
00:14:30,593 --> 00:14:32,617
I think you have something
of mine.

252
00:14:42,388 --> 00:14:44,749
Sweetie,
let's sit down on the couch.

253
00:14:45,063 --> 00:14:46,823
Your dad and I have
some talking to do.

254
00:14:47,145 --> 00:14:48,277
You go ahead, Sam.

255
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,662
Just play with
your coloring books.

256
00:15:27,432 --> 00:15:28,860
This is what you want, right?

257
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,616
Among other things.

258
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:36,596
You been lying to me, Robert.

259
00:15:37,638 --> 00:15:39,722
When did you fall back
in love with your wife?

260
00:15:43,426 --> 00:15:44,429
It's okay.

261
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:46,417
You go back to your book.
Go ahead.

262
00:15:52,456 --> 00:15:55,543
We tried to institute
rationing early on,

263
00:15:55,544 --> 00:15:57,665
but it took some time
for people to accept

264
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,053
that we were really
on our own.

265
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,671
Looks like you did a better job
than most towns I've seen.

266
00:16:02,859 --> 00:16:04,841
Town's lucky to have
a military man in charge.

267
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,634
Well, I guess we
made out all right.

268
00:16:06,635 --> 00:16:08,103
With salt from my mine,

269
00:16:08,104 --> 00:16:10,423
we've been able to do
some trading with nearby towns.

270
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,486
Your town seems
to have been blessed.

271
00:16:13,424 --> 00:16:14,646
That said, uh...

272
00:16:14,803 --> 00:16:16,649
I can't say you'll be
a priority on the list.

273
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,020
Um, uh...
Wait a minute... what list?

274
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:22,266
We got detachments all over Kansas
assessing each town's needs.

275
00:16:22,267 --> 00:16:25,195
Relief is given
on an as needed basis.

276
00:16:25,196 --> 00:16:26,908
Wait a second.
You're saying that because

277
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:29,369
we planned better than others
it will come against us?

278
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,940
We can make out for
a while longer if we have to.

279
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:34,753
That's easy for you to say.
You're not being held accountable.

280
00:16:34,918 --> 00:16:36,933
Why don't you give me
that want list and, uh,

281
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:38,398
I'll see what I can do.

282
00:16:47,229 --> 00:16:48,497
Try that one.

283
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,632
Perfect.

284
00:16:54,626 --> 00:16:56,777
So you're really not going
to tell me what happened?

285
00:16:57,651 --> 00:16:59,203
Doc says frostbite.

286
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,958
Doctor also say
who kicked your ass?

287
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,784
Someone ran us off the road.

288
00:17:08,512 --> 00:17:10,749
Most of it's a blur.
Just, uh,

289
00:17:11,653 --> 00:17:13,264
tried to stay alive, you know?

290
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,484
I do.

291
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:21,782
- So, the marines, huh?
- Yeah.

292
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:23,790
Is it everything you hoped for?

293
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,145
There are moments.

294
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:29,399
But when I signed up, I never
thought I'd be fighting Americans.

295
00:17:31,345 --> 00:17:33,394
Good people forced
to do bad things.

296
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:35,403
That's got to be rough.
I'm sorry.

297
00:17:35,436 --> 00:17:36,735
It's not your problem.

298
00:17:42,668 --> 00:17:43,793
What?

299
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:47,274
Just, uh,

300
00:17:48,426 --> 00:17:50,810
wondering why someone like you
would join the marines.

301
00:17:50,877 --> 00:17:52,323
Someone like me?

302
00:17:54,051 --> 00:17:56,235
I had an office job
until a few years ago,

303
00:17:56,236 --> 00:17:57,265
but I got bored.

304
00:17:57,747 --> 00:17:59,153
I wanted to see the world.

305
00:17:59,154 --> 00:18:01,050
- Have you?
- I've seen Omaha.

306
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:04,199
- You?
- What, seen the world? Yeah.

307
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:08,482
Yeah, I just saw
all the wrong places.

308
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,304
Man,

309
00:18:11,797 --> 00:18:15,247
you have this brooding,
bad-boy thing down to an art.

310
00:18:24,075 --> 00:18:26,453
The video I was sent
before the attacks,

311
00:18:26,935 --> 00:18:28,949
those people were not
holding you captive.

312
00:18:29,313 --> 00:18:30,577
You were just...

313
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,280
what, you were playing me?

314
00:18:32,463 --> 00:18:33,834
Me playing you?

315
00:18:35,926 --> 00:18:37,308
We were living together.

316
00:18:37,521 --> 00:18:40,221
I showed up here
and you have a family again.

317
00:18:41,229 --> 00:18:43,425
It's okay.
It's just a...

318
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:47,196
a story, you know?
It's just a story we're telling.

319
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:48,568
Go back to your book.

320
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,550
You made me promises, Robert.

321
00:18:51,154 --> 00:18:52,836
Who were the people in that video?

322
00:18:52,943 --> 00:18:54,389
Is that who you're working for?

323
00:18:54,454 --> 00:18:56,928
I was. Now,
I'm working for myself.

324
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:00,209
So why don't you
give me what I want,

325
00:19:00,424 --> 00:19:02,513
and then this story
can have a happy ending.

326
00:19:08,324 --> 00:19:10,413
What are you gonna do
in the Marines finally...

327
00:19:10,488 --> 00:19:12,749
- cut you loose?
- I try not to think about it.

328
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:13,965
That means you have.

329
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:16,872
After everything I've seen...

330
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:19,887
I'd like to find a nice little town

331
00:19:19,888 --> 00:19:21,902
and just settle in
for the duration.

332
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:24,044
I don't think those
exist anymore.

333
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,977
I just found out they do.

334
00:19:29,186 --> 00:19:30,204
What about you?

335
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:31,862
You ever thought
about flying again?

336
00:19:32,153 --> 00:19:33,246
Maybe for the military?

337
00:19:33,321 --> 00:19:35,421
Sure. Safer than being
on the ground, right?

338
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,245
Not if you're a radio operator.

339
00:19:37,495 --> 00:19:39,605
I'm the safest of all.
I get to ride in the tank.

340
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:42,148
But if you ride in the tank,
how'd the radio get shot?

341
00:19:42,496 --> 00:19:43,803
What, you think a girl can't...

342
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,300
get out and kick some ass
every once in a while?

343
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:50,788
Who you trying to call
on that thing anyway?

344
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,860
Uh, division headquarters
in Dodge City.

345
00:19:52,861 --> 00:19:54,038
That's about 200 miles away.

346
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:55,398
This thing's made it farther.

347
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:57,765
Of course, that was
before it took some rounds.

348
00:20:00,845 --> 00:20:02,334
Fourth MAR-DIV.
Fourth MAR-DIV,

349
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:05,349
this is First Platoon, Charlie Company.
Authentication "thunder." Over.

350
00:20:08,938 --> 00:20:10,481
Fourth MAR-DIV.
Fourth MAR-DIV.

351
00:20:10,482 --> 00:20:13,546
This is First Platoon, Charlie Company.
Authentication "thunder." Over.

352
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:17,167
<i>Lima Charlie Thunder.
This is Charlie Company Actual.</i>

353
00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:19,943
<I>We've been trying to raise you
on this frequency for days.

354
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:24,168
<I>Division needs the entire
fourth tank battalion RTB ASAP.

355
00:20:24,384 --> 00:20:25,648
<I>Do you copy?

356
00:20:26,969 --> 00:20:28,169
Aye, aye, sir.

357
00:20:28,256 --> 00:20:30,120
<I>Make that most tricky-tick, Corporal.

358
00:20:30,851 --> 00:20:32,844
Roger that,
Charlie Company Actual, out.

359
00:20:38,758 --> 00:20:39,765
What's going on?

360
00:20:40,879 --> 00:20:42,968
We just got ordered
back to Dodge City.

361
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,218
What are you going to do
with the package, Sarah?

362
00:20:48,593 --> 00:20:49,825
Sell it.

363
00:20:50,644 --> 00:20:52,691
And get as far away
from here as possible.

364
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,692
What happened to you?

365
00:21:06,842 --> 00:21:08,192
The last few months,

366
00:21:08,686 --> 00:21:10,303
I've learned two things.

367
00:21:10,711 --> 00:21:12,478
Everybody has a price.

368
00:21:13,614 --> 00:21:15,253
And everybody lies.

369
00:21:19,775 --> 00:21:20,792
Sit still, Sam.

370
00:21:20,793 --> 00:21:22,131
- Take your...
- Stay there

371
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,637
I was just having a conversation
with your husband...

372
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:27,026
about what's more
important to him...

373
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:28,104
His job...

374
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,257
or his family.

375
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,691
Why are you leaving ?

376
00:21:46,701 --> 00:21:48,067
Because we were
ordered to.

377
00:21:48,117 --> 00:21:50,199
Sorry, but I can't reveal
operational orders.

378
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,450
Army Corps of Engineers
will be through eventually.

379
00:21:52,483 --> 00:21:53,867
Eventually?
How long?

380
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,567
Sir, listen, I'm sorry,
but I just don't know.

381
00:21:58,032 --> 00:21:59,699
You ready to roll?
Good to go, Gunny.

382
00:21:59,824 --> 00:22:00,966
But I don't know
about the tank.

383
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:03,249
Don't know if we have enough fuel
to make it back to Dodge City.

384
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,350
Leave it behind
if we have to.

385
00:22:04,351 --> 00:22:06,500
We'll post Sigloch and Kent here
till we can make it back.

386
00:22:06,517 --> 00:22:08,774
Sergeant, without armor we're
sitting ducks for those highwaymen.

387
00:22:08,775 --> 00:22:10,617
We're marines. We'll make do.

388
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,434
I can get you fuel.

389
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,016
Not much, but enough
to get you back to Dodge.

390
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,450
Just give me an hour.

391
00:22:18,717 --> 00:22:19,734
I'm listening.

392
00:22:20,617 --> 00:22:23,200
Plus... whatever
supplies you need.

393
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,050
But I just need assurances that
Jericho will be taken care of.

394
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:32,017
There's three C-130s
full of Red Cross supplies

395
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:34,117
that are supposed to arrive
in Kansas in 12 days.

396
00:22:34,134 --> 00:22:36,617
I guarantee you'll be
at the top of their list.

397
00:22:36,933 --> 00:22:37,966
That's all I ask.

398
00:22:38,349 --> 00:22:39,616
All right, people,
listen up!

399
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:41,467
We're going to stand
down for one hour.

400
00:22:42,184 --> 00:22:46,517
When the relief effort comes,
are you guys coming with it?

401
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:47,966
No.

402
00:22:48,716 --> 00:22:51,266
You're going have to flirt with
a whole new batch of grunts.

403
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:52,699
And the Corps of Engineers

404
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,393
are nowhere near
as cute as I am.

405
00:22:56,684 --> 00:22:58,034
You should think about...

406
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,784
coming back when you get out.

407
00:23:02,317 --> 00:23:03,634
What would I do here?

408
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:08,834
That's a question we're all
asking ourselves, but...

409
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:10,978
you're a good fit.

410
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:15,761
You know,
before all this started,

411
00:23:17,252 --> 00:23:18,885
I might have agreed with you.

412
00:23:18,985 --> 00:23:20,002
But, uh...

413
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,352
I won't make it back here.

414
00:23:44,417 --> 00:23:45,484
Corporal Mullin!

415
00:23:46,484 --> 00:23:47,867
Yes, Gunnery Sergeant.

416
00:23:47,934 --> 00:23:49,534
Why is your gear
not loaded up?

417
00:23:50,084 --> 00:23:51,417
- Uh...
- Don't answer that.

418
00:23:52,016 --> 00:23:53,465
We're headed over
to the town hall.

419
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:55,117
The mayor wants
to express his appreciation.

420
00:23:55,118 --> 00:23:56,674
Somebody needs to stay here.
You...

421
00:23:56,675 --> 00:23:58,224
Youjust drew
the short straw.

422
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:00,408
Aye, Gunny.

423
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:04,715
I'm going to go get

424
00:24:04,716 --> 00:24:07,437
the last of the supplies
from the sheriff's office.

425
00:24:11,495 --> 00:24:13,209
Get the package.

426
00:24:14,242 --> 00:24:16,392
You know I can't do that.

427
00:24:16,776 --> 00:24:18,859
You think I'm going
to believe a word you say?

428
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:20,834
Come on. We can work this out.

429
00:24:21,392 --> 00:24:23,309
You had your chance
to go with me.

430
00:24:23,392 --> 00:24:24,559
Please!
Shut up!

431
00:24:26,475 --> 00:24:29,100
You're losing something tonight.
I promise you that.

432
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:31,345
Only question is,

433
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:33,479
is it going to be something
with a heartbeat?

434
00:24:42,862 --> 00:24:44,028
I'll get the package.

435
00:24:44,445 --> 00:24:47,045
Please put that gun down.

436
00:24:48,628 --> 00:24:50,878
Why don't you get
Allison down here, too?

437
00:24:58,661 --> 00:25:01,244
<i>Lima Charlie Thunder.
This is Charlie Company Actual.</i>

438
00:25:01,245 --> 00:25:02,261
Do you copy?

439
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,828
Lima Charlie,
it's cold as hell out here.

440
00:25:04,829 --> 00:25:07,078
Hello?
This is Jake Green.

441
00:25:07,144 --> 00:25:09,319
Jake Green, this is an official
Marine channel.

442
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,878
Get off this...

443
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:15,228
Hello?

444
00:25:16,627 --> 00:25:18,110
Hello. Are you taking fire?

445
00:25:52,165 --> 00:25:53,173
Hey, Gunny!

446
00:25:54,765 --> 00:25:57,380
It's just a little something
to remember us by.

447
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,363
This is too kind, Mr. Mayor,

448
00:25:59,364 --> 00:26:00,395
but, uh, we really
should press on.

449
00:26:00,396 --> 00:26:02,812
No, you can't take off
on an empty stomach.

450
00:26:04,121 --> 00:26:06,088
Come on in, I got
a little surprise for you.

451
00:26:06,221 --> 00:26:08,671
Just something to show our
gratitude. Come on.

452
00:26:18,938 --> 00:26:20,505
I need you to grab some of
our guys from patrol

453
00:26:20,506 --> 00:26:22,621
and do a sweep of the
area, all right? Take guns.

454
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,538
Are you kidding?

455
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:26,017
I mean, we got
the US Marines Corps here.

456
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:28,500
Something's wrong about all this.
Trust me.

457
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,122
Okay, okay. Well...
what am I looking for?

458
00:26:31,572 --> 00:26:33,172
A guy with a radio for starters.

459
00:26:33,338 --> 00:26:35,366
Check anywhere within
earshot of the fireworks.

460
00:26:35,832 --> 00:26:37,616
All right, maybe it's
nothing. Just check.

461
00:26:37,716 --> 00:26:38,749
- All right? Go!
- Okay.

462
00:26:38,866 --> 00:26:39,881
I can't talk.

463
00:26:40,996 --> 00:26:42,763
What?
It's good talking to you.

464
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:54,599
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen.

465
00:26:54,911 --> 00:26:56,594
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

466
00:26:58,278 --> 00:26:59,461
Honored guests.

467
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:04,127
I was very hopeful
that former Sergeant Green

468
00:27:04,294 --> 00:27:05,910
might like to
say a few words.

469
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:17,844
Ladies and gentlemen, um...

470
00:27:18,194 --> 00:27:22,194
Marine Corps has a motto
"Semper fidelis"

471
00:27:22,578 --> 00:27:23,611
Always faithful.

472
00:27:24,794 --> 00:27:27,378
And I think it's very fitting
that in our darkest hour,

473
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,944
it was marines who came
to our rescue.

474
00:27:30,978 --> 00:27:32,678
Never before
in our nation's history

475
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:34,961
has a motto been so tried...

476
00:27:36,694 --> 00:27:38,261
...and so necessary.

477
00:27:40,211 --> 00:27:42,744
Gunny, Marines,

478
00:27:43,678 --> 00:27:44,694
semper fi.

479
00:28:03,644 --> 00:28:05,344
So, Gunny,
the Fighting Fourth.

480
00:28:05,345 --> 00:28:06,944
Seen more than
your share of action.

481
00:28:06,945 --> 00:28:10,094
From Iwo to Iraq, if there's a war,
there's the fourth.

482
00:28:10,095 --> 00:28:11,111
Semper fi.

483
00:28:17,178 --> 00:28:18,461
Excuse us a second.

484
00:28:21,911 --> 00:28:24,386
What is the matter?
What's going on?

485
00:28:29,853 --> 00:28:30,869
Downstairs.

486
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:43,289
I just, uh...

487
00:28:43,673 --> 00:28:45,706
I heard the fireworks
over the marines' radio,

488
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,906
and Dodge City
is 200 miles away.

489
00:28:47,907 --> 00:28:50,023
- What?  - They've got somebody
on the edge of town

490
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:51,840
pretending
to be their headquarters.

491
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:54,428
I sent Stanley and a couple of
the guys to check it out.

492
00:28:54,429 --> 00:28:55,878
Tell me I'm crazy.

493
00:28:56,628 --> 00:28:58,178
If you are, so am I.

494
00:28:59,396 --> 00:29:01,496
Nobody calls an NCO "sir,"

495
00:29:01,497 --> 00:29:03,546
and a marine
would never say, "Hoo-ah."

496
00:29:03,547 --> 00:29:04,746
That's an Army thing.

497
00:29:05,062 --> 00:29:06,629
These guys
did both.

498
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,262
Marines are all
about detail.

499
00:29:08,745 --> 00:29:10,945
Well, if they're not marines,
who are they?

500
00:29:11,662 --> 00:29:14,078
People with enough firepower
to wipe us out.

501
00:29:14,244 --> 00:29:16,569
And we gave them half
the town's supplies.

502
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:21,835
What do we do?

503
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,410
Well, we've got to tell Gray.

504
00:29:23,411 --> 00:29:25,710
How do we get Gray alone?
He's right next to them.

505
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,077
We got to do something
about that tank.

506
00:29:27,078 --> 00:29:28,986
That thing gets turned lose
on Main Street,

507
00:29:28,987 --> 00:29:30,003
it'll be a
bloodbath.

508
00:29:30,004 --> 00:29:33,120
Even if you get that tank, they'll still
have a room full of hostages.

509
00:29:37,581 --> 00:29:38,731
She's right.

510
00:29:38,931 --> 00:29:40,948
We better get back before
they start to wonder.

511
00:29:41,048 --> 00:29:43,904
Try to get a message to Gray,
and I'll wait for Stanley.

512
00:29:43,971 --> 00:29:45,904
I'll see what I can do
about the tank.

513
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:41,783
Hey.

514
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:49,333
How was Dodge City picking up
our fireworks?

515
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,083
We pick up pops and pings
all the time...

516
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,100
Don't lie to me!

517
00:30:54,383 --> 00:30:56,783
<i>Hello? Anyone out there?</i>

518
00:31:00,816 --> 00:31:02,766
Stanley, is that you?

519
00:31:02,975 --> 00:31:04,617
Jake, we found this guy
camping out here

520
00:31:04,618 --> 00:31:06,425
with this radio.
Says he's with the marines.

521
00:31:06,426 --> 00:31:07,750
I'm going to bring him back.

522
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:10,551
Is any of this real?

523
00:31:10,552 --> 00:31:12,035
The gun's real.

524
00:31:14,601 --> 00:31:15,610
I'm sorry.

525
00:31:16,418 --> 00:31:17,884
You con people out
of stale food

526
00:31:17,885 --> 00:31:19,534
and enough fuel to get
to the next town?

527
00:31:19,535 --> 00:31:21,236
You don't know how bad
it is out there.

528
00:31:21,237 --> 00:31:22,319
Yeah, I do.

529
00:31:24,886 --> 00:31:26,519
Where'd you get all this?

530
00:31:27,567 --> 00:31:30,700
There was a food riot
in our refugee camp.

531
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,650
A dozen marines
never had a chance

532
00:31:34,651 --> 00:31:36,283
against 10,000 starving people.

533
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,550
So you killed them?

534
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:41,567
They retreated
and we took what they left.

535
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,917
Tried to get some food
in the next town.

536
00:31:44,317 --> 00:31:46,383
It worked so well,
we kept doing it.

537
00:31:46,824 --> 00:31:47,615
Don't.

538
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:49,666
You're not leaving town
with those supplies.

539
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:52,773
Don't get yourself killed
doing something stupid, Jake.

540
00:31:53,423 --> 00:31:55,206
I don't want that
on my conscience.

541
00:31:58,348 --> 00:31:59,748
You don't have it in you.

542
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:21,390
Open it.

543
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:38,633
Step... back.

544
00:32:44,474 --> 00:32:45,481
My God.

545
00:32:45,482 --> 00:32:48,007
- This has been here the whole time?
- It is not armed,

546
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,656
and the lead blocks
all the radiation...

547
00:32:49,657 --> 00:32:51,754
- You brought that into our house?!
- D...

548
00:32:58,665 --> 00:33:01,015
We were almost out of here,
and you told him, Maggie?

549
00:33:01,016 --> 00:33:02,215
He figured it out.

550
00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:04,315
He heard the fireworks
on the radio.

551
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,348
- So what do we do with him now?
- What do you mean?

552
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:07,465
Let's just leave.

553
00:33:07,598 --> 00:33:08,608
And what...

554
00:33:09,307 --> 00:33:11,874
wait for him to tell the whole town
when we're half a mile out?

555
00:33:11,952 --> 00:33:13,668
It'll be Greenville
all over again.

556
00:33:13,751 --> 00:33:14,934
We're not killers.

557
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,401
I was a P. E. teacher
who saw too many movies.

558
00:33:17,659 --> 00:33:18,993
Now I'm a marine.

559
00:33:19,043 --> 00:33:20,043
I'm adapting.

560
00:33:20,076 --> 00:33:22,526
- No.
- It's him or us.

561
00:33:22,983 --> 00:33:23,983
I vote for you.

562
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,067
You know, ammunition
being in such short supply,

563
00:33:31,068 --> 00:33:32,783
I doubt those weapons
are even loaded.

564
00:33:32,784 --> 00:33:34,384
You want to take that chance?

565
00:33:34,784 --> 00:33:36,484
I know damn well this one is.

566
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,634
Son of a... bitch!

567
00:33:41,275 --> 00:33:42,900
Get your hands up!
Get them up!

568
00:33:47,105 --> 00:33:48,122
Get up.

569
00:33:48,889 --> 00:33:50,605
How dare you wear
that uniform!

570
00:33:50,705 --> 00:33:52,822
It's not a uniform...
it's a costume.

571
00:33:52,922 --> 00:33:55,089
Half the towns we go through
don't even fly the flag.

572
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:57,653
Wait. Everything you said
about the war, North Korea,

573
00:33:57,654 --> 00:33:58,663
it was all a lie?

574
00:33:58,664 --> 00:34:00,479
Some of it we heard,
some we made up.

575
00:34:00,729 --> 00:34:02,479
It's anybody's guess what's really
going on out there.

576
00:34:02,504 --> 00:34:04,004
Well, we still have laws
in Jericho,

577
00:34:04,005 --> 00:34:06,810
and tomorrow I'm going to let the town
decide what to do with you.

578
00:34:07,277 --> 00:34:08,410
We can't do that, Gray.

579
00:34:08,476 --> 00:34:09,660
The hell we can't!

580
00:34:09,851 --> 00:34:11,576
People need to know
what we're up against.

581
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:12,601
Not like this.

582
00:34:12,602 --> 00:34:13,926
Well, they're going to find out
eventually.

583
00:34:13,976 --> 00:34:15,043
Yeah, they will.

584
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:17,209
And by then, the worst
of it will be over.

585
00:34:17,292 --> 00:34:18,776
But food's not enough.

586
00:34:18,917 --> 00:34:20,334
You said it yourself.

587
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:22,192
Without some "X" factor,

588
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,538
we don't make it through the winter.
Well, this is it.

589
00:34:24,921 --> 00:34:27,402
People need faith
just as much as they need food.

590
00:34:27,802 --> 00:34:29,685
And what the hell
do we do with them?

591
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,960
Then we give a hero's exit.

592
00:34:40,693 --> 00:34:41,727
Ooh-rah.

593
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,227
How can I be sure
you won't follow me?

594
00:34:44,326 --> 00:34:45,360
I won't follow you.

595
00:34:46,343 --> 00:34:48,713
Not if I take your son with me,
you won't.

596
00:34:49,037 --> 00:34:49,846
My God.

597
00:34:49,847 --> 00:34:51,931
I'll leave him
just outside of town.

598
00:34:52,698 --> 00:34:53,698
No!

599
00:35:00,884 --> 00:35:03,206
- Dad!
- Allie, get them out of here!

600
00:36:07,427 --> 00:36:09,356
- You okay?
- I'm fine, Dad.

601
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:11,327
- I'm sorry.
- Dad...

602
00:36:11,328 --> 00:36:12,957
I'm fine.

603
00:36:20,662 --> 00:36:21,881
Let me take this.

604
00:36:28,846 --> 00:36:30,640
You are not fine.

605
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:34,003
Robert, we are not fine!

606
00:36:35,114 --> 00:36:37,163
How long till-till
more people come after you?

607
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:38,657
Huh, after us?

608
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,822
- Come on, D, we're safe here.
- Don't...!

609
00:36:44,591 --> 00:36:46,023
We'll never be safe with you.

610
00:36:46,277 --> 00:36:47,483
Come on.

611
00:36:53,335 --> 00:36:54,339
Let's go.

612
00:36:57,097 --> 00:36:58,222
Let's go.

613
00:37:01,611 --> 00:37:02,709
I love you, Dad.

614
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:07,182
I love you, too, baby girl.

615
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,423
Move out! Let's go!

616
00:37:45,044 --> 00:37:46,945
Our own personal escort
out of town?

617
00:37:48,177 --> 00:37:49,450
Look, you're a smart girl,

618
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,806
you need to get out
before these guys get you killed.

619
00:37:51,807 --> 00:37:52,811
And go where?

620
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:55,200
Towns aren't taking refugees,

621
00:37:55,201 --> 00:37:57,276
and there's only one thing
they want women for.

622
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:59,418
Stay here... all right,
you'll be safe.

623
00:37:59,632 --> 00:38:02,221
It's not going to work.
Not after the story we told.

624
00:38:13,926 --> 00:38:14,931
Not now, Mimi.

625
00:38:14,932 --> 00:38:16,979
Like hell not now, Cornhusker.

626
00:38:17,187 --> 00:38:19,678
Cornhuskers are from Nebraska.
I'm a Jayhawk.

627
00:38:22,793 --> 00:38:23,878
What? What?

628
00:38:24,548 --> 00:38:26,583
You drive me so crazy,

629
00:38:26,784 --> 00:38:29,222
and you know that
I can't stay here forever, but...

630
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:31,726
the truth is...

631
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:34,311
I can't live without you, either.

632
00:38:39,976 --> 00:38:40,994
Really?

633
00:38:41,315 --> 00:38:42,842
Yes, really.

634
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:21,075
We got enough food to get all of you
a few days down the road.

635
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,048
Hey, how about some water, man?

636
00:40:26,973 --> 00:40:28,406
Make do.

637
00:40:29,812 --> 00:40:31,928
You'll leave your weapons
on the tank,

638
00:40:32,142 --> 00:40:33,656
and you will move out.

639
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,424
Do it.

640
00:40:51,051 --> 00:40:52,098
Come on.

641
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,502
Let's go.

642
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,501
Be careful.

643
00:41:17,552 --> 00:41:18,857
What do we do?

644
00:41:21,085 --> 00:41:22,708
We soldier on.

645
00:41:24,936 --> 00:41:26,292
What do we do with that?

646
00:41:33,692 --> 00:41:35,115
Got room in your barn?

647
00:41:35,718 --> 00:41:36,873
Seriously?

648
00:41:37,342 --> 00:41:38,497
Why not.

649
00:41:39,601 --> 00:41:41,577
Never know when
you might need a tank.

650
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,879
