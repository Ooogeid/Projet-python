1
00:00:00,398 --> 00:00:01,953
<i>Previously on Jericho...</i>

2
00:00:02,071 --> 00:00:04,333
<i>Western states</i> have
all fallen in with Cheyenne.

3
00:00:04,373 --> 00:00:06,104
They're strong
and getting stronger.

4
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:08,446
Texans are getting close
to siding with Cheyenne.

5
00:00:08,493 --> 00:00:10,680
If that happens,
it's the ball game.

6
00:00:10,764 --> 00:00:12,102
I have one of the bombs.

7
00:00:12,175 --> 00:00:14,744
<i>When I get to Texas</i>
to meet up with my contacts, I'll call.

8
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:16,495
- <i>Hawkins.</i>
- What do you need me for?

9
00:00:16,535 --> 00:00:17,671
<i>I need your bomb.</i>

10
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:20,350
<i>It's concrete evidence
that can't be refuted.</i>

11
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,996
Mimi, this is Trish Merrick.
She's with Jennings & Rall.

12
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:25,705
<i>I'm so glad</i> we have you on board,
I can't even tell you.

13
00:00:25,746 --> 00:00:28,237
There's a $10,000 discrepancy.

14
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:29,432
Someone took it.

15
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:32,340
<i>I'm the chief</i> administrator
of this town and I want your ledger.

16
00:00:32,425 --> 00:00:34,761
Bonnie, right?
Is Mimi Clark inside?

17
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:43,061
It was Goetz. And his men.

18
00:00:43,107 --> 00:00:44,603
<i>They killed her for the ledger.</i>

19
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:45,980
<i>Goetz is off limits.</i>

20
00:00:46,126 --> 00:00:48,651
No threats, no retribution,
no exceptions.

21
00:00:48,696 --> 00:00:51,610
Goetz, I want to see your hands!
Remember, we need him alive!

22
00:00:51,655 --> 00:00:52,763
If he winds up dead,

23
00:00:52,806 --> 00:00:54,651
Beck will wreak havoc
on both these towns.

24
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:55,513
Stanley.

25
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:59,370
<i>Beck is gonna put
the pieces together.</i>

26
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:03,111
The minute that body hit the ground,
<i>this became a whole different deal.</i>

27
00:01:10,765 --> 00:01:13,041
- Everyone in position?
- Our men are standing by.

28
00:01:13,108 --> 00:01:16,151
They've been fully briefed
on target packages and objectives, sir.

29
00:01:17,818 --> 00:01:19,220
They had their chance.

30
00:01:26,305 --> 00:01:27,360
At ease, gentlemen.

31
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:31,271
You all know who we're looking

32
00:01:31,776 --> 00:01:33,142
Let's bring 'em in.

33
00:01:53,937 --> 00:01:55,440
- All clear!
- Clear!

34
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:16,433
<i>What do you</i> think you're doing?

35
00:02:16,476 --> 00:02:19,421
This bar is a haven for Insurgent
activity. I'm gonna turn it upside down

36
00:02:19,468 --> 00:02:21,680
till I find those responsible
for the murder of Goetz.

37
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:23,731
They're not here.
I don't know where they are.

38
00:02:23,986 --> 00:02:25,200
Even Eric Green?

39
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,801
I haven't seen any of them
since Bonnie was killed.

40
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:29,100
Major,

41
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:31,682
- locked door in the kitchen.
- It's a pantry.

42
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:33,802
There's nothing in there
but peanuts and pretzels.

43
00:02:33,846 --> 00:02:36,383
Either you open it or
we ruin a perfectly good door.

44
00:02:47,965 --> 00:02:50,890
My kids are probably freaking out.
I should be home right now.

45
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:52,791
They're already watching
our homes, Jimmy.

46
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,681
Getting yourself arrested
isn't gonna help your family.

47
00:02:55,726 --> 00:02:58,053
We should go plead our case to Beck.

48
00:02:58,276 --> 00:03:00,571
Goetz was a murderer.
It had to be done.

49
00:03:00,828 --> 00:03:03,233
Unfortunately,
Beck said no revenge killings.

50
00:03:03,547 --> 00:03:04,911
He's not going to let it go.

51
00:03:07,597 --> 00:03:10,070
- Where are you going?
- Turning myself in.

52
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:12,713
No, Stanley. Stanley!

53
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,962
- Get off me! Get off me!
- It's not gonna help.

54
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:17,840
You're staying here with us.
That's all there is to it.

55
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:20,330
Just let me go, please.
Just let me go.

56
00:03:27,346 --> 00:03:30,101
It didn't take Beck long to
figure out what happened to Goetz.

57
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:33,600
From the word around town, he
doesn't seem to have the whole picture.

58
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:36,133
He knows
the Rangers were involved,

59
00:03:36,428 --> 00:03:38,112
doesn't seem to know that I was there.

60
00:03:38,747 --> 00:03:41,831
And I don't think he's figured
out who pulled the trigger.

61
00:03:42,378 --> 00:03:44,241
Well, it doesn't really matter.

62
00:03:44,717 --> 00:03:46,661
We can't stay here forever

63
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:49,002
and we can't take
on the whole Army.

64
00:03:50,215 --> 00:03:51,213
Jake...

65
00:03:52,806 --> 00:03:54,921
I know you want
to protect your friend,

66
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:58,732
but this is only going to get
worse until Beck gets the shooter.

67
00:04:00,495 --> 00:04:02,510
There's only one thing to do.

68
00:04:26,108 --> 00:04:27,712
This is a good start.

69
00:04:29,326 --> 00:04:30,890
Where's the rest of 'em?

70
00:04:32,408 --> 00:04:33,520
It's my fault.

71
00:04:33,987 --> 00:04:35,321
And no one else's.

72
00:04:35,946 --> 00:04:38,283
- I'm the sheriff...
- You were sheriff.

73
00:04:39,936 --> 00:04:41,622
I'm the only one to blame.

74
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:44,251
The only one.
So my terms are simple.

75
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:46,973
My surrender for the amnesty
of the other Rangers.

76
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:52,983
I accept your surrender.

77
00:04:54,355 --> 00:04:55,561
But not the terms.

78
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:02,491
No!

79
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:03,761
No, no!

80
00:05:04,407 --> 00:05:05,220
<i>No!</i>

84
00:05:46,315 --> 00:05:48,341
You got me.
What more do you want?

85
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:50,413
The truth would be a good start.

86
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,150
I killed Goetz.

87
00:05:55,216 --> 00:05:57,613
- You're lying.
- No. He was my problem.

88
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:01,593
I know that you and the Rangers
had a shootout with Ravenwood,

89
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:05,030
killing several men in self-defense.

90
00:06:06,177 --> 00:06:09,282
I know that you subdued
and disarmed Goetz.

91
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:11,811
I know that you attempted to arrest him.

92
00:06:12,016 --> 00:06:14,681
And I know that Stanley
Richmond then killed him.

93
00:06:16,595 --> 00:06:18,282
Where are you getting all this?

94
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:20,321
I have a reliable source.

95
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,070
He killed my best friend's sister.

96
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:32,171
- She was 18 years old.
- I know.

97
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,330
And that was the end
of a long line of murders.

98
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:37,453
- He needed to be dealt with.
- You're not a judge.

99
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,711
You don't get to make that call.

100
00:06:42,787 --> 00:06:46,151
Tell me where I can find Stanley
and all this will end.

101
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:55,811
I'm not giving him up.

102
00:06:56,868 --> 00:07:00,001
If that's what you're waiting for you're
going to be here a very long time.

103
00:07:02,185 --> 00:07:03,641
Bring him in.

104
00:07:09,086 --> 00:07:10,703
Your friend Russell.

105
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:15,101
He said the same thing.

106
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:18,360
But everybody breaks.

107
00:07:19,048 --> 00:07:20,271
Eventually.

108
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:22,673
And until you do,

109
00:07:22,868 --> 00:07:25,550
these four walls
will be your entire world.

110
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,920
You will not sleep...

111
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:30,231
unless I let you.

112
00:07:31,096 --> 00:07:33,780
You will not eat until I feed you.

113
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:36,590
You will give me what I want.

114
00:07:40,705 --> 00:07:42,691
I'll check back with you in a day.

115
00:08:00,515 --> 00:08:02,123
- Beck took Jake.
- What?

116
00:08:02,457 --> 00:08:04,322
- Where?
- I don't know.

117
00:08:04,636 --> 00:08:08,232
Jake tried to surrender, they put a hood
over his head and they dragged him away.

118
00:08:08,536 --> 00:08:10,462
I don't think it's
safe for us to stay here.

119
00:08:10,806 --> 00:08:12,663
- Jake isn't going to talk.
- He won't have to.

120
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:14,600
At the rate Beck's going

121
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:16,862
it'll only be couple of days
before he finds this place.

122
00:08:16,905 --> 00:08:18,221
Maybe Stanley was right.

123
00:08:18,518 --> 00:08:20,851
He turns himself in,
Beck doesn't destroy the town.

124
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:24,153
- Nobody's turning Stanley in.
- We are not giving up on Jake either.

125
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:26,712
Now, this is still a negotiation.

126
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:28,773
What we need is leverage against Beck.

127
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:33,731
Everybody get your gear.

128
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:42,062
We're camping?

129
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,500
Yeah, Sam, but just for a few days

130
00:08:46,838 --> 00:08:48,490
This place smells funny.

131
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,141
Sam, put your stuff away in the bedroom.

132
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:53,423
Come on, I'll show you where

133
00:09:01,186 --> 00:09:02,071
Yeah?

134
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,683
<i>Ready to come to Texas?</i>

135
00:09:05,508 --> 00:09:07,093
- Chavez? <i>- Yeah.</i>

136
00:09:07,368 --> 00:09:08,690
Who else would it be?

137
00:09:09,468 --> 00:09:11,472
Is Texas ready to hear our case?

138
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,531
They're willing to listen.

139
00:09:13,976 --> 00:09:16,410
But Texas is on the verge
of joining Cheyenne.

140
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:18,462
<i>If those two create an alliance,</i>

141
00:09:18,506 --> 00:09:20,201
<i>the United States is history.</i>

142
00:09:20,398 --> 00:09:22,570
<i>My contacts say
they won't wait long.</i>

143
00:09:22,985 --> 00:09:24,860
<i>You got to get the
package down here now.</i>

144
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:26,866
I'm sending the coordinates.

145
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,735
I'll be there as soon as I can.

146
00:09:43,606 --> 00:09:45,207
<i>It's not going to be that simple.</i>

147
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:47,762
<i>Cheyenne has checkpoints
from here to there.</i>

148
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:50,613
Hawkins, you there?

149
00:09:51,786 --> 00:09:53,422
I think I may have a solution to that.

150
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:55,953
<i>Copy that.</i>

151
00:09:56,146 --> 00:09:58,241
<i>Just get here as fast as you can.</i>

152
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,210
I don't know how long
I can keep these guys waiting.

153
00:10:02,387 --> 00:10:03,393
Hey...

154
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,050
I said I'll be there.

155
00:10:24,286 --> 00:10:25,770
See what's going on up there.

156
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,663
Hey! Aren't you guys gonna
get that thing off the road?

157
00:10:46,205 --> 00:10:47,961
Hey, I know you can hear me.

158
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:51,062
Hey there!

159
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,732
Listen, we need you to do us a favor.

160
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:02,761
Sorry about this.

161
00:11:04,435 --> 00:11:05,923
<i>Down, get down.</i>

162
00:11:06,097 --> 00:11:07,453
We need your truck.

163
00:11:08,075 --> 00:11:09,431
All clear!

164
00:11:10,196 --> 00:11:12,310
<i>Put down your weapons.
Hands where I can see 'em!</i>

165
00:11:16,377 --> 00:11:17,381
Major,

166
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:20,181
we learned why the resupply
convoy is so late.

167
00:11:21,268 --> 00:11:22,160
Well?

168
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,481
We found it on the hood of
a dismantled Humvee at Checkpoint Zero.

169
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:34,592
"We have your gas, guns and ammo.

170
00:11:35,406 --> 00:11:37,271
Will trade for Sheriff Green."

171
00:11:55,345 --> 00:11:56,540
Get him up.

172
00:11:59,256 --> 00:12:01,032
I want you to sign something.

173
00:12:02,616 --> 00:12:04,920
It's a letter, from you to your Rangers,

174
00:12:05,305 --> 00:12:06,863
rejecting their tactics

175
00:12:07,256 --> 00:12:09,212
in trying to secure your release.

176
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:11,132
Your friends

177
00:12:11,457 --> 00:12:14,483
have been escalating this
to a level I will not tolerate.

178
00:12:14,758 --> 00:12:17,670
They're putting their lives
in danger out of loyalty to you.

179
00:12:18,295 --> 00:12:19,961
Is that really what you want?

180
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:23,581
We both know where
it goes from here, Jake.

181
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:27,031
End it right now.

182
00:12:27,578 --> 00:12:29,200
Agree to sign this letter.

183
00:12:30,185 --> 00:12:31,683
Give me Stanley's location.

184
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:50,591
The offer of amnesty in exchange
for Stanley Richmond is rescinded.

185
00:12:50,705 --> 00:12:52,392
The Rangers are now considered...

186
00:12:52,435 --> 00:12:54,773
fugitives. I want all of them.

187
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:56,493
Good luck finding them.

188
00:12:57,378 --> 00:12:58,931
Until they're produced,

189
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:02,422
I'm declaring Jericho
to be in open insurrection.

190
00:13:13,046 --> 00:13:14,303
<i>Go! Go!</i>

191
00:13:16,788 --> 00:13:18,233
<i>All the way down in the corner.</i>

192
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,211
Lights, power, food supplies...

193
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:24,621
9:00 p.m. Tonight,
I'm shutting it all down.

194
00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:31,452
We've lived without that stuff before,
we'll do it again.

195
00:13:31,638 --> 00:13:32,742
<i>Do not move!</i>

196
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:36,912
You really want to test me?

197
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:39,952
You want to see
how far I'll take it?

198
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:41,973
<i>Move back!</i>

199
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:45,750
<i>Move back across that line!</i>

200
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:49,120
<i>Move back, people!</i>

201
00:13:50,336 --> 00:13:51,662
<i>Whatever happens</i>

202
00:13:51,768 --> 00:13:53,091
<i>from here on out,</i>

203
00:13:53,606 --> 00:13:56,022
never forget, you caused it.

204
00:14:04,318 --> 00:14:05,622
<i>Move back! Move back!</i>

205
00:14:17,115 --> 00:14:17,911
Yeah?

206
00:14:18,577 --> 00:14:19,582
<i>Hawkins?</i>

207
00:14:20,435 --> 00:14:23,330
- <i>Yes.
- What's this I hear about Texas?</i>

208
00:14:23,716 --> 00:14:26,342
I don't know. You tell me.

209
00:14:26,585 --> 00:14:29,562
<i>I have contacts inside
the Texas government.</i>

210
00:14:30,005 --> 00:14:31,862
<i>You promised them the bomb, didn't you?</i>

211
00:14:31,946 --> 00:14:35,241
No, I have not promised
anybody anything.

212
00:14:35,515 --> 00:14:37,020
<i>That bomb is the key</i>

213
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:39,831
<i>to bringing down
this government and they know it.</i>

214
00:14:40,175 --> 00:14:42,433
<i>They'll never let you get it
to Texas.</i>

215
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:45,182
So what are you saying
I should do?

216
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,883
<i>I've found you a secure destination
closer to home</i>

217
00:14:49,006 --> 00:14:50,782
<i>that's friendly to our cause.</i>

218
00:14:50,928 --> 00:14:52,642
<i>We can examine the bomb there,</i>

219
00:14:52,756 --> 00:14:55,832
<i>prove our case without risking
a border crossing.</i>

220
00:14:57,478 --> 00:15:00,470
Where is this,
"secure destination"?

221
00:15:01,058 --> 00:15:04,942
<i>Give me time to finish the arrangements,
and I'll contact you with the location.</i>

222
00:15:05,098 --> 00:15:06,282
How much time?

223
00:15:06,475 --> 00:15:08,801
<i>A day. Two at the most.</i>

224
00:15:10,886 --> 00:15:11,931
Okay...

225
00:15:13,165 --> 00:15:14,571
John Smith.

226
00:15:18,538 --> 00:15:19,921
When are you leaving?

227
00:15:20,275 --> 00:15:21,272
Now.

228
00:15:25,168 --> 00:15:29,232
Keep the kids out here
till all this blows over.

229
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,633
Please tell me you have some brilliant
plan, Robert, to get this thing

230
00:15:34,947 --> 00:15:37,543
all the way to Texas
with no one checking your trunk.

231
00:15:43,467 --> 00:15:44,751
You stole a shirt?

232
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:47,851
- That's your plan?
- No.

233
00:15:50,836 --> 00:15:52,440
Stole a truck, too.

234
00:15:53,347 --> 00:15:56,961
See, J&R employees
get a free pass at the checkpoints.

235
00:15:57,768 --> 00:16:00,880
Now please tell me that you have a plan
to get back here.

236
00:16:31,355 --> 00:16:32,492
What is this?

237
00:16:33,127 --> 00:16:35,220
I think it's pretty self-explanatory.

238
00:16:35,647 --> 00:16:37,302
No power, no water,

239
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:38,840
no food a full embargo

240
00:16:38,966 --> 00:16:40,870
if those men aren't
in my custody by tonight.

241
00:16:40,915 --> 00:16:42,812
I've been defending you
to everyone.

242
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:46,842
How long or how much this town suffers
is up to its citizens.

243
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:50,481
Somebody knows where those men are.

244
00:16:50,596 --> 00:16:52,073
The Rangers were saving lives

245
00:16:52,127 --> 00:16:54,230
back when you couldn't
have found Jericho on a map.

246
00:16:54,278 --> 00:16:55,443
They kept order,

247
00:16:55,496 --> 00:16:57,991
fought off raiders,
organized the fight against New Bern.

248
00:16:58,045 --> 00:16:59,541
People won't just give them up.

249
00:16:59,665 --> 00:17:01,272
Whatever their reasons,

250
00:17:01,415 --> 00:17:04,712
this government will not tolerate
insurrection.

251
00:17:05,446 --> 00:17:07,600
You remember the question you asked me

252
00:17:07,677 --> 00:17:10,051
when you offered me this job
and I didn't want it?

253
00:17:11,348 --> 00:17:13,190
You asked me if I couldn't
tell the difference

254
00:17:13,235 --> 00:17:15,053
between you and Phil Constantino.

255
00:17:17,845 --> 00:17:19,270
Right now, I can't.

256
00:17:32,258 --> 00:17:33,280
Then help me.

257
00:17:34,037 --> 00:17:35,581
Talk to Jake yourself.

258
00:17:36,016 --> 00:17:38,683
Get him to realize what
he's doing to this town.

259
00:17:39,376 --> 00:17:42,180
You've had him in custody three days.

260
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:43,882
He's not doing this,

261
00:17:44,206 --> 00:17:45,001
you are.

262
00:17:49,316 --> 00:17:51,633
I don't know
if I can keep defending you.

263
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,310
<i>Not many deer... not many deer...</i>

264
00:18:12,408 --> 00:18:14,400
<i>Not many deer out here anymore.</i>

265
00:18:14,668 --> 00:18:16,943
<i>Not many deer out here anymore.</i>

266
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:22,323
I guess global warming has
sent them all north.

267
00:18:28,197 --> 00:18:30,460
I don't know how much
more I can take, Grandpa.

268
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:32,961
They're just trying
to soften you up.

269
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:37,132
A man's mind doesn't
work very good without sleep.

270
00:18:37,436 --> 00:18:38,910
Break a man's mind,

271
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:41,102
he'll give you anything you want.

272
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:43,780
Like they tried with you at Anzio.

273
00:18:45,598 --> 00:18:47,091
You know, the Germans

274
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:50,423
captured over 400 of us in that ambush.

275
00:18:51,366 --> 00:18:53,000
How'd you get through it?

276
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,321
I thought about home.

277
00:18:57,616 --> 00:18:59,321
I thought about your grandma.

278
00:19:00,296 --> 00:19:02,552
But the thing that
really got me through it

279
00:19:02,797 --> 00:19:06,763
was knowing that I had to protect
the lives of the men in my unit.

280
00:19:07,865 --> 00:19:09,710
The one thing you have to remember

281
00:19:09,755 --> 00:19:12,171
is that people
are depending on you.

282
00:19:32,527 --> 00:19:33,992
Have you seen Stanley?

283
00:19:35,877 --> 00:19:38,450
He's with Eric and Emily.

284
00:19:47,776 --> 00:19:49,042
How is he?

285
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:53,392
He's not talking...

286
00:19:53,738 --> 00:19:54,812
to anybody.

287
00:19:59,017 --> 00:20:00,452
Take me to him.

288
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:01,983
Mimi, you've been shot,

289
00:20:02,028 --> 00:20:04,023
- you really...
- I can do whatever I need to.

290
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,211
Just please...

291
00:20:08,258 --> 00:20:09,591
Take me to Stanley.

292
00:20:17,998 --> 00:20:19,802
<i>Explain this to me... explain...</i>

293
00:20:20,148 --> 00:20:21,593
Explain this to me.

294
00:20:23,237 --> 00:20:25,082
I hurt everybody that was
ever close to me

295
00:20:25,128 --> 00:20:27,582
and I got a second chance,
but Stanley...

296
00:20:30,008 --> 00:20:32,203
Stanley never hurt a soul in his life.

297
00:20:32,768 --> 00:20:35,522
- And he lost everything.
- How is that right?

298
00:20:35,975 --> 00:20:38,780
Life doesn't... Work on a balance sheet,
I know, but it should.

299
00:20:38,908 --> 00:20:41,913
And your punishment
is to sit in this hole and die.

300
00:20:43,187 --> 00:20:45,323
How does that bring back Bonnie?

301
00:20:45,476 --> 00:20:47,211
Or the Stanley you knew?

302
00:20:47,707 --> 00:20:49,433
Or the little girl in Iraq?

303
00:20:50,537 --> 00:20:51,712
T's a start.

304
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:54,701
It's an ending. <i>It's an ending.</i>

305
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:57,732
- <i>What choice do I have?</i>
- What choice do I have?

306
00:20:58,196 --> 00:21:00,571
The answer is Beck.

307
00:21:03,276 --> 00:21:05,371
I don't even know
where to start with him.

308
00:21:05,418 --> 00:21:07,310
And he's too stubborn to listen.

309
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,731
Your father said
that about you once.

310
00:21:10,655 --> 00:21:12,293
You turned out real nice.

311
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:16,592
It's not about convincing
one man he's wrong.

312
00:21:17,168 --> 00:21:18,751
It's a... it's a whole system.

313
00:21:18,848 --> 00:21:20,442
You think it's impossible?

314
00:21:20,815 --> 00:21:22,631
This has all happened before.

315
00:21:22,938 --> 00:21:25,360
If the names weren't Jennings & Rall,

316
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:27,341
they would be names like

317
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:30,520
the British East India
Trading Company.

318
00:21:31,317 --> 00:21:34,430
If it wasn't Ravenwood,
it would be the Hessian mercenaries.

319
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,622
<i>Mercenaries.</i>

320
00:21:35,735 --> 00:21:37,611
<i>And it all comes down</i>

321
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:40,453
<i>to the same thing...
to the same thing.</i>

322
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:43,360
Revolution.

323
00:21:49,427 --> 00:21:51,081
<i>Revolution.</i>

324
00:22:46,405 --> 00:22:48,081
- I love you.
- Don't.

325
00:22:48,237 --> 00:22:49,761
- I do.
- Don't.

326
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,260
Stanley, look at me.

327
00:22:54,308 --> 00:22:57,432
- We're going to get through this.
- I don't want to get through this.

328
00:22:57,607 --> 00:23:00,253
I know that it must feel
like that right now, but...

329
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,381
What am I gonna do?
Am I gonna go back to the farm?

330
00:23:02,428 --> 00:23:05,033
I'm gonna feed the chickens,
plan a wedding?

331
00:23:08,978 --> 00:23:10,242
Bonnie's dead...

332
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:13,360
and I killed a man.

333
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:17,351
Nothing's going to change that,
nothing.

334
00:23:31,457 --> 00:23:32,432
Yeah.

335
00:23:32,475 --> 00:23:35,041
- <i>I thought we had an agreement.</i>
- We did.

336
00:23:35,325 --> 00:23:37,833
<i>Then why are you
on your way to Texas?</i>

337
00:23:39,576 --> 00:23:41,870
How do you know I am
on my way to Texas?

338
00:23:41,955 --> 00:23:43,542
<i>I'm well connected.</i>

339
00:23:43,768 --> 00:23:47,230
<i>If you think you can do this
without my help, you're mistaken.</i>

340
00:23:47,578 --> 00:23:50,431
<i>I know the ins and outs
of J&R better than anyone.</i>

341
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:53,252
<i>So turn the car around.</i>

342
00:23:54,056 --> 00:23:56,411
<i>We can make history together,
you and I.</i>

343
00:23:58,307 --> 00:24:00,642
I am sorry to disappoint you.

344
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:03,730
<i>I hoped we could work together,</i>

345
00:24:03,938 --> 00:24:06,202
<i>but I'll just have
to find another way.</i>

346
00:24:08,565 --> 00:24:09,572
Yeah.

347
00:24:16,025 --> 00:24:18,271
When the September
attacks happened and...

348
00:24:18,497 --> 00:24:22,433
D.C. was destroyed along with
everybody and everything I ever knew,

349
00:24:22,556 --> 00:24:24,731
I didn't think I would
ever live through it.

350
00:24:25,848 --> 00:24:28,400
I couldn't breathe,
and everything went black.

351
00:24:30,998 --> 00:24:32,441
And then I found you.

352
00:24:35,756 --> 00:24:37,812
The attacks happened to us.

353
00:24:39,175 --> 00:24:41,133
Somebody else pulled the trigger.

354
00:24:42,227 --> 00:24:44,653
Yeah. And Goetz killed Bonnie.

355
00:24:46,128 --> 00:24:49,080
- Everybody understands what you did.
- Hi-His...

356
00:24:52,036 --> 00:24:54,610
His hands were tied.
He wasn't going anywhere.

357
00:24:56,735 --> 00:24:59,871
He looked at me and I remember
thinking to myself, "This...

358
00:25:02,006 --> 00:25:03,570
this is just some guy."

359
00:25:04,598 --> 00:25:06,020
I mean, all the buildup,

360
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:08,613
the tracking down Goetz,
Goetz the killer.

361
00:25:10,446 --> 00:25:11,960
He was just some guy.

362
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:17,672
Everything just, everything...

363
00:25:19,386 --> 00:25:21,293
washed out of me and I wasn't...

364
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:24,601
I wasn't scared, I wasn't angry.

365
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:36,912
I just pulled the trigger.

366
00:25:39,517 --> 00:25:40,860
That's what I did.

367
00:26:03,476 --> 00:26:04,560
E.J. Green,

368
00:26:04,626 --> 00:26:08,142
U.S. Army Rangers, 1942-1945.

369
00:26:09,758 --> 00:26:10,821
Johnston Green,

370
00:26:10,866 --> 00:26:14,532
U.S. Army Rangers, 1969-1976.

371
00:26:16,748 --> 00:26:18,761
Both your father and grandfather

372
00:26:18,905 --> 00:26:20,291
were great soldiers.

373
00:26:21,946 --> 00:26:22,942
Mine, too.

374
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:27,550
I know how hard it can be
to live up to someone else's legacy.

375
00:26:29,318 --> 00:26:30,771
Says here they both...

376
00:26:31,368 --> 00:26:32,430
became mayor.

377
00:26:35,188 --> 00:26:37,732
Do you think they would have supported
the citizens of this town

378
00:26:37,776 --> 00:26:39,532
taking the law
into their own hands?

379
00:26:41,447 --> 00:26:42,361
Move it!

380
00:26:48,226 --> 00:26:50,192
They never would have
let it get that far.

381
00:26:50,498 --> 00:26:51,533
Excuse me?

382
00:26:53,827 --> 00:26:55,411
They would have never...

383
00:26:56,385 --> 00:26:58,781
handed over this town
to a mercenary.

384
00:27:02,445 --> 00:27:04,562
They didn't have
to do what I'm doing,

385
00:27:05,186 --> 00:27:07,523
stopping Americans
from killing Americans,

386
00:27:07,765 --> 00:27:09,911
putting a country back on its feet.

387
00:27:11,745 --> 00:27:12,993
Open your eyes.

388
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,672
It's not a country,
it's a company,

389
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:18,733
and you're just middle management.

390
00:27:19,867 --> 00:27:22,733
The people of Jericho are
going to take this town back.

391
00:27:22,827 --> 00:27:25,330
You're going to have
a revolt on your hands.

392
00:27:26,056 --> 00:27:26,861
Halt!

393
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:40,510
It's not working.

394
00:27:41,637 --> 00:27:42,840
He's digging in.

395
00:27:44,227 --> 00:27:45,863
- Next steps.
- Yes, sir.

396
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,000
Sir.

397
00:27:47,468 --> 00:27:50,112
We also have a call for you.
Patched it through.

398
00:27:54,477 --> 00:27:56,102
Yeah, this is Major Beck.

399
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:59,140
<i>I have information on
a terrorist you're hunting.</i>

400
00:28:00,107 --> 00:28:01,190
Who is this?

401
00:28:01,427 --> 00:28:03,742
<i>I know you think you're
searching for Sarah Mason,</i>

402
00:28:03,917 --> 00:28:06,141
<i>but she's been dead
for a few months.</i>

403
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,152
<i>Look at your fax machine.</i>

404
00:28:09,658 --> 00:28:10,962
Who am I speaking with?

405
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:13,720
<i>The terrorist she worked
with killed her.</i>

406
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:15,843
<i>His name is Robert Hawkins...</i>

407
00:28:16,637 --> 00:28:18,522
<i>and he has a nuclear bomb.</i>

408
00:28:32,118 --> 00:28:33,112
<i>Jake.</i>

409
00:28:38,298 --> 00:28:39,292
<i>Honey.</i>

410
00:28:42,997 --> 00:28:44,612
<i>Jake.</i>

411
00:28:45,386 --> 00:28:46,672
Baby.

412
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:48,891
Jake.

413
00:28:50,005 --> 00:28:51,612
Look at me, sweetheart.

414
00:28:54,828 --> 00:28:55,820
Mom.

415
00:28:58,317 --> 00:29:00,083
Mom, what are you doing here?

416
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,373
I heard you were in
a little bit of trouble.

417
00:29:08,515 --> 00:29:09,512
Here,

418
00:29:09,868 --> 00:29:11,852
have a drink of water.
Come on, honey.

419
00:29:11,988 --> 00:29:13,873
There you go. Careful.

420
00:29:18,147 --> 00:29:19,503
There you go.

421
00:29:19,687 --> 00:29:21,783
That's better. You okay?

422
00:29:23,366 --> 00:29:25,732
Sweetheart,
you can't keep this up

423
00:29:25,895 --> 00:29:28,441
and I can't stand
to see you like this.

424
00:29:29,105 --> 00:29:31,433
There's got to be another way.

425
00:29:31,587 --> 00:29:33,291
Mom, you shouldn't be here.

426
00:29:33,406 --> 00:29:34,601
Now, listen.

427
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:37,071
You just tell Major Beck

428
00:29:37,607 --> 00:29:40,472
whatever he wants to know, please,

429
00:29:40,848 --> 00:29:43,181
- and then he'll release you.
- No, Mom.

430
00:29:45,007 --> 00:29:45,800
No.

431
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,053
I love you, son.

432
00:29:53,978 --> 00:29:56,033
Eric and the boys are coming.

433
00:29:56,895 --> 00:29:58,920
I love you. Stay alert.

434
00:29:59,147 --> 00:30:00,381
Don't give up.

435
00:30:19,366 --> 00:30:20,372
Mom?

436
00:30:24,986 --> 00:30:25,983
Mom?

437
00:31:27,605 --> 00:31:30,072
<i>This is Delta niner.
I have a visual.</i>

438
00:31:30,237 --> 00:31:31,913
<i>Coming around for approach.</i>

439
00:31:38,057 --> 00:31:40,213
<i>Fox One, Fox Two,
he's in the trees.</i>

440
00:31:40,376 --> 00:31:43,291
<i>We'll wait for you to flush
him out on the other side.</i>

441
00:31:48,227 --> 00:31:50,063
I delivered the message to Jake.

442
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,090
- I need a map.
- Did you see where they took you?

443
00:31:52,137 --> 00:31:55,943
No, I was blindfolded, I couldn't see
a thing, but I can help you find him.

444
00:31:56,075 --> 00:31:58,063
Okay, Beck put me in a Humvee

445
00:31:58,206 --> 00:32:00,511
and we took a right off
of Main Street

446
00:32:00,636 --> 00:32:03,572
and then we just kept on going until
we crossed the Tacoma Bridge,

447
00:32:03,616 --> 00:32:05,901
which means
we were heading southeast.

448
00:32:05,978 --> 00:32:09,282
And then we went straight
for about maybe 20 minutes

449
00:32:09,336 --> 00:32:11,121
and then we took a left
on a gravel road

450
00:32:11,175 --> 00:32:13,002
and I thought we were
at the Levine farm,

451
00:32:13,055 --> 00:32:14,723
but the road felt

452
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:18,423
bumpy all of a sudden.
Really bumpy. Like railroad tracks.

453
00:32:18,476 --> 00:32:22,132
Sounds like you were out on 48,
between Alex-Bell and Lytle Five-Points.

454
00:32:22,217 --> 00:32:24,213
That's at least five square miles.

455
00:32:25,746 --> 00:32:27,250
Can you remember anything else?

456
00:32:29,645 --> 00:32:31,370
It smelled terrible.

457
00:32:32,497 --> 00:32:33,583
Hog farm.

458
00:32:51,825 --> 00:32:54,203
This is definitely
the place they've got Jake.

459
00:32:57,068 --> 00:33:00,011
Two sentries at the door,
M4s and sidearms.

460
00:33:00,168 --> 00:33:02,182
Humvee, driver, that's it.

461
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:03,892
Well,

462
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:06,213
what are we waiting for?

463
00:33:08,106 --> 00:33:09,412
Let's go get him.

464
00:33:40,188 --> 00:33:41,452
<i>Target in sight.</i>

465
00:34:25,095 --> 00:34:26,452
Nighthawk Zero-Six,

466
00:34:26,518 --> 00:34:28,750
this is Fox Two.
We found the package.

467
00:34:28,835 --> 00:34:30,302
<i>Roger that, Fox Two.</i>

468
00:34:38,885 --> 00:34:40,241
Jake, come on!

469
00:34:47,235 --> 00:34:48,240
Help me!

470
00:34:51,676 --> 00:34:52,591
<i>Cover us!</i>

471
00:35:02,126 --> 00:35:04,060
<i>- Get him in.
- Easy.</i>

472
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:06,103
It's okay, we got you now.

473
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:08,602
<i>Go! Go!</i>

474
00:35:31,017 --> 00:35:31,980
<i>You escaped.</i>

475
00:35:32,157 --> 00:35:35,503
You know you should have waited
for daylight to try and burn me.

476
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:39,110
I might not have been so lucky.

477
00:35:40,457 --> 00:35:44,360
<i>I regret it had to come to that,
but you left me little choice.</i>

478
00:35:45,168 --> 00:35:46,792
You've got a problem now.

479
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:49,393
'Cause you tipped your hand.

480
00:35:50,187 --> 00:35:53,821
You didn't just know where I was going,
you knew exactly where I was.

481
00:35:54,105 --> 00:35:56,220
And that means
you were tracking me.

482
00:35:56,845 --> 00:35:58,581
<i>How would I have done that?</i>

483
00:35:59,095 --> 00:36:01,251
I think that's where it gets
interesting,

484
00:36:01,297 --> 00:36:03,063
because this phone is secure.

485
00:36:03,798 --> 00:36:05,372
And the car was stolen.

486
00:36:06,467 --> 00:36:08,683
So the only way you could've done it...

487
00:36:10,145 --> 00:36:13,261
was to have a tracking
device inside the bomb.

488
00:36:14,057 --> 00:36:16,361
<i>- You sound paranoid.</i>
- Yeah,

489
00:36:16,797 --> 00:36:18,390
well, that just may be.

490
00:36:20,026 --> 00:36:21,630
But 14 years ago,

491
00:36:22,176 --> 00:36:24,440
it was you that wrote
the report detailing

492
00:36:24,487 --> 00:36:26,473
how a massive
nuclear terrorist attack

493
00:36:26,515 --> 00:36:28,661
would decapitate the federal government,
right?

494
00:36:28,916 --> 00:36:30,131
And in that report,

495
00:36:30,317 --> 00:36:32,350
you stated that one individual

496
00:36:32,437 --> 00:36:33,621
with enough access

497
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:36,651
could mastermind
that entire attack.

498
00:36:37,235 --> 00:36:40,343
See it makes sense that whoever
put those bombs in the field

499
00:36:40,776 --> 00:36:42,822
would have tracking devices
in every single

500
00:36:42,876 --> 00:36:45,933
one of them so he would know
when they were in place.

501
00:36:48,866 --> 00:36:49,860
You

502
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:51,580
had the axe to grind.

503
00:36:52,407 --> 00:36:54,450
You knew the system... Damn!

504
00:36:55,086 --> 00:36:57,511
It was you who wrote the plan.

505
00:36:59,088 --> 00:37:00,341
And then, I think,

506
00:37:00,648 --> 00:37:01,803
it was you

507
00:37:01,948 --> 00:37:03,383
who put that plan

508
00:37:03,498 --> 00:37:04,593
into practice.

509
00:37:08,075 --> 00:37:10,130
You're not just some
innocent whistle-blower.

510
00:37:10,178 --> 00:37:11,040
Are you?

511
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:14,001
<i>I believe that I am.</i>

512
00:37:14,558 --> 00:37:16,801
<i>Only the last time
I blew the whistle,</i>

513
00:37:17,297 --> 00:37:19,792
<i>I took out 23 American cities.</i>

514
00:37:51,238 --> 00:37:53,940
Sir, no sign of Jake Green
or the Rangers.

515
00:37:53,987 --> 00:37:55,992
No serious casualties
from the raid of farmhouse.

516
00:37:56,038 --> 00:37:58,611
- What about the rest of the town?
- Three dead, all civilians.

517
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,642
Another 14 wounded,
three of them are ours.

518
00:38:00,748 --> 00:38:04,252
We've got 12 guys in lock
up for various acts of arson and...

519
00:38:49,198 --> 00:38:51,093
<i>You killed millions,</i>

520
00:38:52,075 --> 00:38:55,041
tens of millions of people.

521
00:38:55,815 --> 00:38:56,613
Why?

522
00:38:56,808 --> 00:38:58,832
<i>To liberate this country.</i>

523
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:02,603
<i>When I worked for J&R,
I saw just how corrupt</i>

524
00:39:02,665 --> 00:39:04,323
<i>the relationship between the company</i>

525
00:39:04,365 --> 00:39:06,641
<i>and the federal government
had become.</i>

526
00:39:06,998 --> 00:39:08,260
<i>No-bid contracts,</i>

527
00:39:08,326 --> 00:39:11,472
<i>a private army,
a corporation that wrote legislation.</i>

528
00:39:11,826 --> 00:39:14,061
<i>J&R was a cancer grown deep</i>

529
00:39:14,136 --> 00:39:16,162
<i>into the bone of this government.</i>

530
00:39:16,615 --> 00:39:20,032
<i>So I decided to remove
that cancer in one fell swoop.</i>

531
00:39:20,195 --> 00:39:21,360
Well, you failed.

532
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:24,792
Because J&R are more powerful
now than they ever were.

533
00:39:25,357 --> 00:39:26,923
<i>They're also more vulnerable.</i>

534
00:39:27,645 --> 00:39:29,302
<i>J&R and the Cheyenne government</i>

535
00:39:29,345 --> 00:39:31,791
<i>are now centralized in one city.</i>

536
00:39:32,168 --> 00:39:34,523
<i>So when I strike the final blow,</i>

537
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:37,162
<i>the disease should be gone
for good.</i>

538
00:39:39,495 --> 00:39:41,421
You're going to attack Cheyenne?

539
00:39:41,975 --> 00:39:43,452
<i>With your bomb.</i>

540
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:46,203
But you don't have it.

541
00:39:47,037 --> 00:39:48,813
The Cheyenne government does.

542
00:39:49,185 --> 00:39:52,632
<i>I know exactly how to get
it back from the Cheyenne military.</i>

543
00:39:53,128 --> 00:39:55,221
<i>And then I'll finish what I started.</i>

544
00:39:56,405 --> 00:39:58,823
<i>I'm just sorry we couldn't
do this together, Mr. Hawkins.</i>

545
00:39:58,876 --> 00:40:00,120
You listen to me,

546
00:40:00,305 --> 00:40:02,013
I told you what would happen

547
00:40:02,055 --> 00:40:05,393
if you ever lied to me,
if you ever tried to play me!

548
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:08,322
I am going to bring this to you.

549
00:40:08,435 --> 00:40:10,793
The next time we speak,
it will not be...

550
00:40:11,036 --> 00:40:12,640
... not be on this phone!

551
00:40:26,697 --> 00:40:27,731
It's okay.

552
00:40:28,678 --> 00:40:29,671
It's okay.

553
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,243
Go back to sleep.

554
00:40:33,548 --> 00:40:35,141
How long have I been out?

555
00:40:35,845 --> 00:40:37,162
Not long enough.

556
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:40,823
It's nice seeing you look peaceful
for a change.

557
00:40:52,385 --> 00:40:53,262
You okay?

558
00:40:54,038 --> 00:40:54,883
Yeah.

559
00:40:55,505 --> 00:40:57,012
Darcy and the kids okay?

560
00:40:57,627 --> 00:40:58,621
Yeah.

561
00:41:06,296 --> 00:41:07,563
Give us a minute?

562
00:41:08,047 --> 00:41:09,053
Yeah.

563
00:41:26,765 --> 00:41:28,313
Jake, I lost the bomb.

564
00:41:31,828 --> 00:41:33,523
The Army's got it.

565
00:41:34,857 --> 00:41:36,090
And right now...

566
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:40,432
... it's on its way to Cheyenne.

567
00:41:46,305 --> 00:41:48,381
What does that mean for Texas?

568
00:41:50,568 --> 00:41:52,162
Can Chavez hold them off?

569
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:55,792
It's not even about that anymore.

570
00:41:59,098 --> 00:42:02,170
Jake, the man behind the
September attacks is out there.

571
00:42:02,778 --> 00:42:05,410
And he is pretty confident
that he can get that bomb back

572
00:42:05,455 --> 00:42:07,881
and use it to destroy
the city of Cheyenne.

573
00:42:15,495 --> 00:42:18,151
There's over a million
people living there now.

574
00:42:18,628 --> 00:42:21,403
Yeah, a million innocent people
because you can bet that

575
00:42:21,495 --> 00:42:23,693
his target, Valente, and the others...

576
00:42:25,798 --> 00:42:27,600
They will not be among the dead.

577
00:42:30,357 --> 00:42:34,291
And this will just give them the excuse
to do whatever the hell they want to do.

578
00:42:39,585 --> 00:42:41,322
You know, if that bomb goes off,

579
00:42:42,597 --> 00:42:44,653
we will lose this country forever,
right?

580
00:42:50,328 --> 00:42:51,592
Jennings & Rall,

581
00:42:51,806 --> 00:42:53,050
the Cheyenne government

582
00:42:53,175 --> 00:42:54,633
they know who I am.

583
00:42:57,168 --> 00:42:58,170
So...

584
00:42:59,055 --> 00:43:02,571
I need you to be okay, because
I can't do what I've got to do alone.

585
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:21,661
When do we leave?

586
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:35,912
