1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,230
previously on jericho

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:06,650
" All right,it looks like the explosion 
came from the west,maybe denver. 

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,630
This could've been a test,
could've been an accident. 

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,060
But if it was an attack 
and there's chaos out there,

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,980
you might not want the wrong people 
knowing that jericho is still here. 

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,020
The unfortunate truth is there 
was another explosion in atlanta. 

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,950
Oh,my god,we got something ! 

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,600
Were they just reporting it or 
are they behind it ? 

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,240
Hire as many deputies as you can. 

10
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,860
Use them to help you get gas. 

11
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,460
Clinic's running low. 

12
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,280
Couldn't find an empty pesticide container. 

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,410
I thought this water tank might do. 

14
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,880
No,no,no,we can't use steel. 

15
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,340
There's too much risk of static. 

16
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,390
The gas has been sloshing around in there. 

17
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,070
One spark,the whole thing could blow sky high. 

18
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,480
We don't have time to look for something else. 

19
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,170
help. 

20
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,530
He's a refugee from denver. 

21
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,680
You recognize him ? 

22
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,430
No. 

23
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,210
We need information. 

24
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,020
Where are they ? 

25
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:49,870
It burns. 

26
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,400
He needs morphine. 

27
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,320
why did you go back to denver ? 

28
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,750
I couldn't let them die. 

29
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,750
Well,it was a mistake,vic.

30
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,250
because now we are a man down. 

31
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,760
he's gone. 

32
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,510
I'm tired of war. 

33
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,740
No one ever really wins. 

34
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,270
Stanley: Me,too. 

35
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,930
Guess we can play crazy eights instead. 

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,280
Or hearts ? 

37
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,550
I'm calling it a night. 

38
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,170
You can call it whatever you want,
but it stopped being night hours ago. 

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,850
Y'all want coffee ? 

40
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,770
Make mine an irish. 

41
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,660
So,mimi,what would you be doing 
if you were back home in D. C.  ? 

42
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,420
Sleeping. 

43
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,530
You know the hardest thing out 
sleeping in this dump ? 

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,400
What ? 
The quiet. 

45
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,470
I don't know how you stand it. 
It's like my brain is an echo chamber. 

46
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,640
Well,why do you think I left town ? 

47
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,170
I could tell her. 

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,550
What ? 

49
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,890
Why jake left town. 

50
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,540
Hey,watch it,jimmy. 

51
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,410
Let me guess. 

52
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,000
The pressure got to be too much. 

53
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,960
I'm a people reader. 

54
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,030
I'm betting captain of the football team,
prom king.

55
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,060
most likely to succeed. 

56
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,810
Am I right ? 

57
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,790
Don't quit your day joB. 

58
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,260
why ? 

59
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,670
What am i missing here ? 

60
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,210
I think he beat up the prom king. 

61
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,430
Oh,yeah,I did. 

62
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,380
Eric,you must have a million stories 
about your brother screwing up,right ? 

63
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,410
Yeah,at least that many. 

64
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,220
Could we get a couple coffees to go,mary ? 

65
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,940
Coming up. 

66
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,330
So.

67
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,270
do we have a plan ? 

68
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,330
just try to get news,make contact. 

69
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,850
We haven't heard from gray in a couple days,so.

70
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,000
no,eric.

71
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,720
do we have a plan ? 

72
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,420
I will talk to april tonight. 

73
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,710
Then ? 

74
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,330
And then I won't need coffee 
as an excuse to come see you. 

75
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,980
Secrets of a small town. 

76
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,170
Hello

77
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,800
Hello,this is assistant secretary walsh 
from the department of homeland security. 

78
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,710
Do not be alarmed. 

79
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,150
If you are safe,stay where you are. 

80
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,200
Do not attempt to leave. 
Who is it,rob ? 

81
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,490
We will be in contact again shortly. 

82
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,380
Until then,know that help is on the way. 

83
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,150
hello,this is assistant secretary walsh 
from the department of homeland security. 

84
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,480

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,100
if you are safe,stay where you are. 

86
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,990
Do not attempt to leave.

87
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,060

To town hall,you good ? 

91
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,630
Yeah. 

92
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,900
Homeland security ? 

93
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,430
That's what they said. 

94
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,630
So they're in charge now ? 

95
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,610
Well,they're supposed to be in charge 
in case of a disaster. 

96
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,030
So what happens next ? 

97
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,750
Why are you asking her ? She's from the irs. 

98
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,750
She's from D. C. 

99
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,060
This is what they told us. 

100
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,780
First,they restore power,then 
communication,then transportation. 

101
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:15,380
I am this close to non-fat lattes and shiatsu. 

102
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,810
Does anybody have a quarter ? 

103
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,730
If they can call in,maybe we can call out. 

104
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,290
calling roger

105
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,300
hey,did your phone ring ? 

106
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,770
Yeah,everyone's did. 

107
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,690
All the land lines in town. 
Why ? 

108
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,580
Because kansas has a reverse 911 system. 

109
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,740
If there's an emergency,it just pulses out a call. 

110
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,080
That's what we all heard. 

111
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,500
Why can't we call out ? 

112
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,760
Everybody's trying to use the phone at the same time. 

113
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,340
System's overloaded. 

114
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,820
You think the power's back for good ? 

115
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,320
I don't know,I'm not gonna count on it. 

116
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,760
Hey,skylar. 

117
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,140
Any luck ? 

118
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:02,880
No. 

119
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,250
I really need to check my e-mail. 

120
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,590
I mean,my parents could've tried 
to contact me from new york. 

121
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,300
Well,have you tried typing a straight ip address ? 

122
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,030
A what ? 

123
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:17,780
It's weird. 

124
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,990
What ? 

125
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,090
Well,the internet was built by the military. 

126
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,480
It's supposed to survive nuclear war. 

127
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,450
So why can't I check my e-mail ? 

128
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,810
Allison. 

129
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,480
Is it working now ? 

130
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,580
it is,but.

131
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,940
not for us. 

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,580
We're being blocked out. 

133
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,070
Uh,miss ? 

134
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,480
You can't do thaT. 
Yeah,okay,thanks. 

135
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,650
welcome to kansas liberty bank

136
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,590
card held

137
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,110
Your machine just ate my card. 

138
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,720
Doesn't work. 

139
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,870
That's what I tried to tell you. 

140
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,190
Thank you. 

141
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,560
You're just so helpful. 

142
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,720
Hey,dad. 

143
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,360
It's the same thing on every channel ? 

144
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,710
So far. 

145
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,890
What about the radio ? 

146
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,620
Same message.sit and wait. 

147
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,920
You look like crap. 

148
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,840
I didn't sleep. 

149
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,190
Next time put the cards down,go home. 

150
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,010
Sooner or later,the phones are gonna free up. 

151
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,220
Let's keep calling out until we reach somebody. 

152
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,630
Calling who ? 

153
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,860
Well,that homeland security message 
came out of topeka; let's start there. 

154
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,870
Yeah,but everybody's thinking that. 

155
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:11,870
I say we start with the national 
guard base in great bend. 

156
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,530
That's a good idea,son. 

157
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,430
We should get to the gas station,
get some gas while.

158
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,950
I already sent jimmy. 

159
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,880
He's there now running the pumps. 

160
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,440
All right,well,we need to charge our batteries. 

161
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,770
All right. 

162
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,740
Looks like you got it covered. 

163
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,580
Where you going ? 

164
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,060
Home. 

165
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,500
You take a shower ? 

166
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,320
Nothing gets past you. 

167
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,010
Go clean the tub and fill it up. 

168
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,570
Why ? 

169
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:53,450
The water doesn't get to that shower by magic. 

170
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,590
If the power goes out again,
so do the pumps that get it there. 

171
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,740
So we store what we can. 

172
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,970
That is why.

173
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:15,080
she is your daughter,rob,not your employee. 

174
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,800
Well.

175
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,550
she needs to talk less and listen more. 

176
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,180
You need to learn to ease up on her. 

177
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,990
Darcy.

178
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:39,080
I don't know how long I'll be here,so whatever 
i gotta teach her,it needs to happen now. 

179
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,760
you know,when we find out what's going on,
are you gonna stay or leave ? 

180
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,240
Don't think about that yet. 

181
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,990
Well,I can't help it. 

182
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,760
I finally have you back. 

183
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,370
you were always good at blocking out the bad. 

184
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,280
Dad,not so much. 

185
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,220
He's had more to block out. 

186
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:22,180
When you left,you left quite a mess. 

187
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,230
You have no idea of the lengths 
you father went to to square things. 

188
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,180
Then why didn't he talk to me ? 

189
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,470
Because he knew you'd resent it. 

190
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,360
And there's a stubborn streak 
that runs in the family. 

191
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,190
Honey.

192
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,800
I think you owe him the truth. 

193
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,110
You want me to tell him about my.

194
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,730
about my time away ? 

195
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,620
This house is too small for big secrets. 

196
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,050
what was that ? 

197
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,060
It's a power spike. 

198
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,440
Boys. 

199
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,330
wow,looks like business as usual. 

200
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,950
How'd you get your kids back so quick ? 

201
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,210
Always lead with recess. 

202
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,530
Emily: Got to get things back to normal. 

203
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,880
Whatever that is. 

204
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,690
Go ! Go ! Go ! 

205
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,090
Hurry,hurry ! 

206
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,470
emily ? 

207
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,400
Emily.

208
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,480
emily ? 

209
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,810
Emily ? 

210
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,570
Oh,my god. 

211
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,260
Emily,wake up. 

212
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,870
Emily,wake up. 

213
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,230
Uh,everybody.

214
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,300
do you remember the emergency 
drills we did at school ? 

215
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:55,960
okay. 

216
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,770
Go find your buddy and go sit behind the fence. 

217
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,670
One,two,three,go ! 

218
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,140
Come on,quickly. 

219
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,290
Go. 

220
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,390
Is she going to wake up ? 

221
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,800
Yes. 

222
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,890
With super powers ? 

223
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,620
Probably not. 

224
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,450
Now,go. Go ! 

225
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,170
Go,lucas,go ! 

226
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,880
Come on,emily,come on. 

227
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,390
Wake up. 

228
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,580
Wonder when they're going to come. 

229
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,690
You really can't wait to fly this coop,huh ? 

230
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,140
Are you still going to file that 
irs report on my farm ? 

231
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,020
That's not exactly my first order of business,

232
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,310
but it is the reason I fell into this godforsaken 
hell hole in the first place. 

233
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:46,840
So is that a yes,no or maybe ? 

234
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,640
It's an eventually. 

235
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,320
Look,if it were up to me,I'd see what I could do. 

236
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,570
But that's probably justthe 
irish coffee talking. 

237
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,740
You got a family back home ? 

238
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,760
I have fish. 

239
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,050
I'm sure they really miss you. 

240
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,870
I wonder what that's about. 

241
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,000
Mary,keep my tab open,will ya ? 

242
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,500
Your tab,stanley ? 

243
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,840
Yeah,and keep the irish coffees coming. 

244
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,340
Till I get my farm back at least. 

245
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,270
You heard the hillbilly. 

246
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,290
Keep 'em coming. 

247
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,890
enter id

248
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,610
okay,let's board her. Get an I. V. Started 
and get some o2 on her. 

249
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,520
Keep an eye on the pulse and let me 
know if her bp drops. 

250
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,680
We got to keep an eye on her. 

251
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,730
Where's ashlee ? 

252
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,730
She went to get alice. 

253
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:47,960
Alice ? 

254
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,270
Alice in wonderland ? 

255
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,940
Inside ? 

256
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,900
ashlee ? 

257
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,470
Ashlee ! 

258
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,580
Ashlee ? 

259
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,750
Honey ? 

260
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,400
Ashlee,honey. 

261
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,480
Ashlee,it's ms. Lisinski. 

262
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,670
Ashlee ! 

263
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,960
Ashlee ! 

264
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,120
Chief,we've got another blaze over 
on the south side. Over. 

265
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,130
Copy that. 

266
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,850
We've got a second fire. 

267
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,770
It's south side near the trailer park. 

268
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,870
But we don't have enough guys to fight this one. 

269
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,240
They'll come back as soon as they can. 

270
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,620
Take the second truck. 

271
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,770
Move ! 

272
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,190
truck 77,let's get a ladder up there. 

273
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,320
what happened ? 

274
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,780
Looks like she got hit with a lot of voltage. 

275
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,680
Go ahead,lock it in ! 

276
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,160
How'd it start ? 

277
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:54,960
Power lines. 

278
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,850
Power lines ? 

279
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,310
Hold the water. 

280
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,450
What's wrong ? 

281
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,990
Electrical fire. 

282
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,110
Spray water on electricity everybody 
it touches gets fried. 

283
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,300
Johnston. 

284
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,100
I thought you were at the ranch. 

285
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,120
The horses are safe. 

286
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,120
What about the stables ? 

287
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,980
There's nothing but dirt around for miles. 

288
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,770
They're fine. 

289
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,150
You are not going to that fire. 

290
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,900
I let chief carrol and half 
the department go to denver. 

291
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,340
We're down to a handful of men. 

292
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,940
Who can handle it. 

293
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,910
Johnston,if you get any sicker than you already 
are,you're not going to be any use to anybody. 

294
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,040
Dad,dad,are you still there ? 

295
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,720
Yeah,eric,I'm on my way. 

296
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:47,740
No,no,no,no,go downstairs and turn off 
the power grid to the library. 

297
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,490
Give me five minutes. 

298
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,940
Looks like you get your way. 

299
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,400
They can use me here. 

300
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,570
Good. 

301
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,780
The power should be cut in five minutes. 

302
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,430
Get your men in position. 

303
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,740
Cover one-seven four blocks east of maple. 

304
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,320
Uh,one call. Stand by. 

305
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,220
What are you doing ? 

306
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,700
Making sure she didn't have a heart attack. 

307
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,690
you're in good hands. 

308
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,550
Power's down. You're good to go. 

309
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,440
Copy. 

310
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,020
All right,that's it,power's down. 

311
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,960
Okay,open them up. 

312
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,060
They're on. 

313
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,030
Okay. 

314
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,340
What's going on ? 

315
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,060
We lost pressure. 

316
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,130
Oh,my god. 

317
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,590
Pumping station must be on the same power grid as us. 

318
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,610
When we lost power to one.we cut into both. 

319
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,370
Where's the pumping station ? 

320
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,230
Up the hill at the end of chaparral. 

321
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,610
Unhook those hoses. 

322
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,190
See if there's a working hydrant around back. 

323
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,430
Right,chief. 

324
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,620
hey,jake. 

325
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,960
Stanley. 

326
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,040
Thank god. 

327
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,010
Chaparral,pumping station,let's go. 

328
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,170
Heather.

329
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,590
where's what ? 

330
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,470
Heather ? Where's heather ? 

331
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,710
Eric. 

332
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,430
Yeah ? 

333
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,320
I think heather might still be inside. 

334
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,680
Nah,they said they cleared the building. 

335
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,430
Are you sure ? 

336
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,800
Ventilate that areA. 

337
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,720
Eric,what are you doing ? 

338
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,220
Eric,no ! 

339
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,230
I wonder what lindsay lohan is doing right now. 

340
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,760
Do you think she's still alive ? 

341
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,490
I'm trying to find my parents,lisa. I could care less. 

342
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,030
Great. 

343
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,620
My battery's almost dead. 

344
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,310
Excuse me,sorry. 

345
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,670
Do you guys sell phone chargers ? 

346
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,440
Um,what kind of phone ? 

347
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,850
I'll check the back. 

348
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,960
Thanks. 

349
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,150
Why do you like that freak ? 

350
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,870
Why do you like stupid,bulimic actresses ? 

351
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,530
Whoa,incoming. 

352
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,630
Whoa,sean,no skateboards. 

353
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,120
Read the sign. 

354
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,640
Hey,you guys got to check it out. 

355
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,690
The library's burning,and I didn't even do it. 

356
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,060
Is anyone hurt ? 

357
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:15,950
Probably. 

358
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,300
Sky,let's go. 

359
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,600
Go ahead,I'll catch up. 

360
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,700
Come on. 

361
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,080
This one says universal,so it should work. 

362
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,560
Um,we were going to go check out the fire. 

363
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,590
If you want to.

364
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:27,760
Dale. 

365
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,320
Make sure our extinguishers are working,will ya ? 

366
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,400
I should stay. 

367
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,910
But if you want,I could charge 
it and you could come back. 

368
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,170
Okay. 

369
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,630
Um,if my parents call.

370
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,150
I'll find you. 

371
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,970
Thanks. 

372
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,650
Come on,if we can open the valve,
we can get water to the fire. 

373
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,060
valve shutoff inside

374
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,020
Ashlee ? 

375
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,900
hey,ashlee. 

376
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,830
Let's get out of here. 

377
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,540
Let's go. Come on. 

378
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,890
Is anyone here ? 

379
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,700
Heather ? 

380
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,810
Come oN. 

381
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,180
Hey,come on,let's go. 

382
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,000
Better do what the angry fireman says. 
Let's go. 

383
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,460
Come on,this way,let's go ! 

384
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,250
damn. 

385
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,510
it's not going to budge. 

386
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,400
Thanks,stanley how do you even know this is it ? 

387
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,150
Trust me,it's the manual override. 

388
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,070
When the power spiked the solenoid 
valves shut down in the off position. 

389
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,920
What ? 

390
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,590
Dude,you're freaking me out. 
How do you even know that ? 

391
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,150
How do you not ? 

392
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,690
Looks like nobody's touched it in years. 

393
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,180
Nobody has. 

394
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,920
The motor opens and closes it when the power's on. 

395
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,000
No power,no motor. 

396
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,210
Yeah,and no water. 

397
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,710
Of course,right now what we really need is leverage. 

398
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,590
You know what ? 

399
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,100
Wait right here. 

400
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,880
you can't go in there,ma'am. 

401
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,580
My husband's in there ! 

402
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,700
Stand back,please. 

403
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:36,250
Ashlee,we're going to go out another way. 

404
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,810
Are you okay ? 
What's wrong ? 

405
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,560
nothing,nothing. 

406
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,730
We just got to use the other door. 

407
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,940
No,no,this way's blocked. 

408
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,320
Smoke ! 

409
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:49,960
We got to stop it. 

410
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,800
Okay,okay,uh,can we use this ? 

411
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,670
Yeah. 

412
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:56,980
okay,honey,I need you to get down and 
try not to breathe the smoke,all right ? 

413
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,430
It's all going to be okay,ashlee. 

414
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,110
It's going to be okay. 

415
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,470
eric ? 

416
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,580
We need another snake. 

417
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:27,600
Ashlee,I need you to crunch down here,
like a game of leap frog,okay ? 

418
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,430
Ready ? 

419
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,970
this is gonna help protect you. 

420
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:58,850
This'll protect you and help you breathe. 

421
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,200
Here. 

422
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,190
Here. 

423
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,180
Here,breathe using this. 

424
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,560
got it ! 

425
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,410
We got it ! 

426
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,160
it's running,it's running. We got water. 

427
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,640
we're gonna be okay. 

428
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,510
Come on,this is our chance. Let's get the hell out of here ! 

429
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,870
Come on,let's go ! 

430
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,380
come on. 

431
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,250
Somebody has to go in there and help them ! 

432
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,090
Ma'am,stay back,please. 

433
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,010
oh,my god. 

434
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:45,660
Are you hurt ? 

435
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,840
No,don't worry about me. 

436
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,970
The little girl,she got a lot of smoke. 

437
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,050
April,can you take her ? 

438
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,770
All right,yeah. 

439
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,690
You're gonna be okay,ashlee. 

440
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:06,910
Give me the scope. 

441
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,670
I want to see if they have water down at the library. 

442
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,340
Listen.

443
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,290
this scope was a christmas present,okay ? 

444
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,630
Relax. 

445
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,150
Careful. 

446
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,630
what do you see ? 

447
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,120
It working. 

448
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,640
They've got water at the library. 

449
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:36,400
What about the south side fire ? 

450
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,540
Looks like the fire's out down by the trailer park. 

451
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,700
There's a lot of smoke. 

452
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,880
There's another fire. 

453
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,190
It's in the east woods. 

454
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,580
What ?  ! 

455
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,300
It's right near eric's house. 

456
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,590
What the hell ? 

457
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,150
What is it,jake ? What's going on ? 

458
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,440
april,april ! 

459
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,980
Eric,eric,there's another fire. 

460
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,910
We'll get to it as soon as we can. 

461
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,820
We need help clearing the alley. 

462
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,670
Eric. 
The fire's spreading. 

463
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,130
Eric,it's heading to your house ! 

464
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,830
What do you want to do ? 

465
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,180
It's heading to your house. 

466
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,560
There's nothing to do. 

467
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,120
We're already spread too thin. 

468
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,660
If we don't stop the fire,it could take out main street. 

469
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,220
April ? 

470
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,580
he's right. 

471
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,390
hardware

472
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,460
What are you planning to do ? 

473
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,110
Put out a fire. 

474
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,410
Do you need a hand ? 

475
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,720
I'm good. 

476
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,490
If I knew anything,I would tell your mayor. 

477
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,380
What do you know ? 

478
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,580
Not much. 

479
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:44,930
I got the same message as everyone else. 

480
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:49,580
Do you want my help ? 

481
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,180
Get in. 

482
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,990
first thing I'm gonna do when I get back to D. C. 

483
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,950
Is burn these clothes. 

484
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,600
So,what's on your agenda once things settle ? 

485
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,850
No agenda. 

486
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,940
Just looking forward to living my life. 

487
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,300
With dudley do wrong ? 

488
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,180
Never gonna happen. 

489
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,890
That's really none of your business. 

490
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,790
Besides.

491
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,490
you don't know eric the way I do. 

492
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,110
Mercifully. 

493
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,830
But I know his kind. 

494
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,780
Guys like that don't leave wives for girls like us. 

495
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,020
"Girls like us" ? 

496
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:43,840
I've been around this particular block before. 

497
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:49,470
Well,I'm sorry to blow your theory,but.

498
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,690
eric is telling his wife about us tonight. 

499
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,550
Is he now ? 

500
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,750
Yes,he is. 

501
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,870
Well,never mind,then. 

502
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,870
To the happy couple. 

503
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,330
get up a littlehigher by that chimney. 

504
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:18,790
Hey,we got it ! 

505
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,750
We got it ! Save your house ! 

506
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,600
What now ? 

507
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,800
Water. 

508
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,670
Let's use the pool pump. 

509
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,980
Filter system. 

510
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,040
That's pretty smart,jake. 

511
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:39,300
So where'd you learn to do all this ? 

512
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,370
I was a pool guy. 

513
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,000
turn it on ! 

514
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,180
Turn it on ! 

515
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:59,030
what ? 

516
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,620
Turn on the pump ! 

517
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,550
Hawkins ! 

518
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,790
Hawkins ! 

519
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,280
Come on. 

520
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,260
What the hell are you doing ? 

521
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,150
Fire knocked out the power.

522
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,510
so I found my own. 

523
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,170
got it ? 

524
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,500
That was quick thinking. 

525
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,850
Yeah,I was a pool guy,too. 

526
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,200
How you doing,ashlee ? 

527
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,530
I'm okay. 

528
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,910
Minor smoke inhalation,but she's gonna be okay. 

529
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,590
You saved her life. 

530
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,380
Are the other fires still going ? 

531
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,440
The south side's under control. 

532
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,380
The one near your house ? 

533
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,000
I haven't heard. My wife.

534
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,090
hey,where's april ? 

535
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,860
You're still here. 

536
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,030
Yeah. 

537
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,030
Did my parents.

538
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,690
sorry. 

539
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,260
It's charged,though. 

540
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,210
You going home now ? 

541
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,540
Are you gonna stay here all night ? 

542
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:22,330
Don't have anywhere else to go. 

543
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,020
The fire moved through the trailer park. 

544
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,900
It's all gone. 

545
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,760
Oh,dale,I am so sorry. 

546
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,710
It's okay. 

547
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,220
No,it's not. 

548
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,010
Why are you being so calm about it ? 

549
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,620
Don't have much of a choice. 

550
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,470
How 'bout,scream ? 

551
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:40,710
Cry. Hit something. Break something. 

552
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,020
Come on. 

553
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:42,810
Where are you going ? 

554
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:43,960
We'll start with the mayor. 

555
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,900
We'll get him to give you a place 
to live and some clothes and some money. 

556
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,740
I can take care of myself. I'll be okay. 

557
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,400
I was just trying to help. 

558
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,360
I know. 

559
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,190
I know. 

560
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:12,260
here,let me help you with that. 

561
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,130
I got it. 

562
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,290
No.

563
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,590
I told you. 

564
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,740
I'm sorry. 

565
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,120
petition for dissolution of marriage

566
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,720
Divorce papers ? 

567
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,700
I had them drawn up before the bombs went off. 

568
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:49,060
I didn't want you to see them. 

569
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,690
I don'T.

570
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,230
I don't want that anymore. 

571
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,290
The divorce,I don't want it. 

572
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:07,510
Well,I can't blame you,april. 

573
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:14,090
Things have been bad between us for a long time. 

574
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,760
Not bad. 

575
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,250
Just.

576
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,510
not good. 

577
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,080
Not now. 

578
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:41,810
Everything's changed,eric. 

579
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:45,440
The world has changed. 

580
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,950
Please. 

581
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,860
We can think about this. 

582
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,900
Just.

583
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,770
not today. 

584
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,270
The good silver. 

585
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,410
What's the occasion ? 

586
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:21,940
Oh,this set's been passed down for five generations. 

587
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:26,240
Probably seen the light of day maybe 
half a dozen times since I've had it. 

588
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,330
From now on,every night's a special occasion. 

589
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,660
Did you turn off the tv ? 

590
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:32,830
Yeah. 

591
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:39,950
Seemed kind of silly to be staring at a blank screen,
waiting for god-knows-who to tell me god-knows-what. 

592
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,670
It did get me thinking,though. 

593
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:44,430
You know that.

594
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:47,680
that thing you've been running away from ? 

595
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,150
It's not out there. 

596
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:54,840
He's upstairs,waiting on dinner. 

597
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,270
hi. 

598
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,970
I'm glad you're home. 

599
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,190
Come on. 

600
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,760
Last call,folks ! 

601
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,290
Closing early tonight ! 

602
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,670
What are we gonna do about this ? 

603
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,400
Watch it at home. 

604
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,670
Or at a friend'S. 

605
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:40,340
last.call. 

606
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,450
Stanley,go tell everyone. 

607
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,470
But I want to watch. 

608
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,950
Then pay your tab. 

609
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,480
Okay,I'm going. 

610
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,880
Check it out,check it out. 

611
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,680
It's something else every day. 

612
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,040
How are we going to handle all this ? 

613
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,630
Same way we did today. 

614
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:19,810
We lost a few buildings but no lives. 

615
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:25,590
And that is,in no small part,thanks to you. 

616
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:30,670
A lot of folks are saying how lucky 
jericho is to have you back again. 

617
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,120
And what are you telling them ? 

618
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,610
Well,I've tried to correct them,but nobody listens to me. 

619
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:51,740
you know what the hardest part 
about growing up your son was ? 

620
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,970
It's not the politics,or the expectations,it'S.

621
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:01,460
it's that I always knew you were a good judge 
of character,and you thought mine was lousy. 

622
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,320
When I left town,I was determined 
to prove you wrong,but.

623
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:15,410
but instead,everywhere I went,
I seemed to prove you right. 

624
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,070
Dad.

625
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,760
I wasn't just in san diego. 

626
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,450
I don't care. 

627
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,290
What ? 

628
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,940
I don't care. 

629
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,920
If you need to tell me,I'll listen,but.

630
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,570
wherever you went,whatever you did,it changed you. 

631
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:57,390
And a stupid little punk may have left home,
but a pretty decent fellow came back. 

632
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,820
I can live with that. 

633
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,900
flagged passparts

634
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,270
passparts flagged

635
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:10,270
daddy,now that the electricity 
is back on,can we go to the movies ? 

636
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,450
Of course. 

637
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,780
And baseball games,and the aquarium,and.

638
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,810
let's just.

639
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,300
start with a movie,okay ? 

640
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,430
Okay. 

641
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,040
Why were you working outside today ? 

642
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,290
Daddy had to fix something. 

643
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:27,860
What was in that big box ? 

644
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,630
That was my tools. 

645
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,600
Come on,sam,it's bedtime. 

646
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,270
Will you come tuck me in,dad ? 

647
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,350
Okay. 

648
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,400
Did you fix the problem ? 

649
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,130
daddy's working on it. 

650
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:54,630
After all these years,wanting to have the whole family around the table.

651
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:57,030
careful what you wish for. 

652
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,190
it's delicious,gail. 

653
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,020
Thanks. 

654
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,770
Yeah,who knew instant potatoes could taste like anything ? 

655
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,320
Well,things will get better after we get real food. 

656
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,540
Filet mignon with bleu cheesE. 

657
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:20,050
Don't pretend you haven't thought about it. 

658
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,960
Cheeseburger and french fries. 

659
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:26,900
Corned beef and cabbage with that spicy mustard. 

660
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,460
Yeah,I could go for a slice of mom's blueberry pie. 

661
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:34,450
Fried chicken with some fresh corn on the cob. 

662
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:36,470
Chocolate cake.

663
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,470
excuse me.they're getting a feed at bailey'S. 

664
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,400
Let's turn on the tv. 

665
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,580
No,they're the only ones picking it up. 

666
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,180
I think it's a satellite feed from D. C. 

667
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:51,170
You're coming,aren't you ? 

668
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,660
Yeah,of course. 

669
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,720
keep moving it; we lost the picture. 

670
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:43,600
What's going on ? 

671
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,210
All right,everybody calm down,all right ? 

672
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:47,360
We'll have it back in a second.
