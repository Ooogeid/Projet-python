1
00:00:01,033 --> 00:00:02,607
<i>Previously on Jericho...</i>

2
00:00:02,647 --> 00:00:04,317
Jake, this is Ted Lewis.

3
00:00:04,357 --> 00:00:06,930
- Hey, how you doing?
- We grew up together over in New Bern.

4
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,822
And this is Russell and Mike.

5
00:00:08,862 --> 00:00:10,176
Hey. Yeah, we met.

6
00:00:10,216 --> 00:00:12,562
<i>I'm Major Beck,</i>
10th Mountain Division.

7
00:00:12,602 --> 00:00:15,829
<i>I want you</i> to be my liaison
to the people of New Bern and Jericho.

8
00:00:16,168 --> 00:00:19,372
<i>I'm sending you a private contractor
who knows the area.</i>

9
00:00:19,497 --> 00:00:22,056
<i>He'll take care of the day-to-day
administration of the town</i>

10
00:00:22,096 --> 00:00:23,875
<i>while you find the terrorist.</i>

11
00:00:23,915 --> 00:00:26,090
Western states have all fallen
in with Cheyenne.

12
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,826
They're strong and getting stronger.

13
00:00:27,866 --> 00:00:29,235
This is our new mission.

14
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:32,090
Expose Cheyenne's secret
before they take over the whole country.

15
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,471
I have one of the bombs.

16
00:00:34,637 --> 00:00:35,641
What is this?

17
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:37,058
<i>Targets, specifications,</i>

18
00:00:37,145 --> 00:00:38,309
<i>contingencies.</i>

19
00:00:38,542 --> 00:00:40,387
<i>Jennings & Rall
put it all in one place.</i>

20
00:00:40,427 --> 00:00:41,938
How do you know about this?

21
00:00:41,978 --> 00:00:44,190
<i>Because... I helped write it.</i>

22
00:00:44,255 --> 00:00:47,012
Mimi, this is Trish Merrick.
She's with Jennings & Rall.

23
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:49,572
<i>I'm so glad</i> we have you on board,
I can't even tell you.

24
00:00:49,612 --> 00:00:52,161
There's a $10,000 discrepancy.

25
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:53,374
Someone took it.

26
00:00:53,414 --> 00:00:56,119
I'm the chief administrator of this town
and I want your ledger.

27
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,455
Bonnie, right?
Is Mimi Clark inside?

28
00:01:56,085 --> 00:01:57,403
Mimi going to be okay?

29
00:01:57,443 --> 00:01:59,083
She's lost a lot of blood.

30
00:02:00,768 --> 00:02:02,018
What do you got?

31
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:06,089
Weapons were nine millimeters.

32
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,440
The tire tracks out front...

33
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,983
look like a Humvee.

34
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:12,971
Ravenwood.

35
00:02:13,445 --> 00:02:15,644
<i>But why?
What would they want here?</i>

36
00:02:15,697 --> 00:02:18,947
Whatever they wanted,
Mimi wasn't supposed to survive.

37
00:02:21,112 --> 00:02:22,287
<i>What do we do?</i>

38
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:25,563
Gather the rangers at the med center.
She needs protection.

39
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,501
Ravenwood does not get near her.

40
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,024
Major.

41
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,805
Tell the other squad to get moving.

42
00:02:40,845 --> 00:02:42,683
We'll rendezvous in 30.
What is it?

43
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:44,600
There was a shooting
out at Richmond Farm.

44
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,529
- I heard from Goetz already.
- What'd he say?

45
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:48,233
Said he went out on J&R business,

46
00:02:48,273 --> 00:02:50,692
someone opened fire on him,
killed three of his men.

47
00:02:50,732 --> 00:02:51,800
You believe that?

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,322
Do you know something I don't?

49
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:54,580
There's a survivor.

50
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,608
- She's unconscious but when she...
- Sir, we're ready and standing by.

51
00:02:57,648 --> 00:03:00,024
- I'm sorry, Jake, I've got to go.
- Where are you going?

52
00:03:00,064 --> 00:03:03,328
20 minutes ago, a pipe bomb went
off outside the J&R office in New Bern.

53
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:05,539
Took out six of my men.

54
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:07,224
I'll be back in 12 hours.

55
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:09,788
- It's not going to wait 12 hours.
- It's going to have to.

56
00:03:09,828 --> 00:03:12,242
Things are coming apart at
the seams in New Bern right now.

57
00:03:12,282 --> 00:03:15,041
And you have my word,
tomorrow I'm going to get into this,

58
00:03:15,081 --> 00:03:18,719
but for tonight I'm trusting that
you can keep things under control here.

59
00:03:18,786 --> 00:03:20,638
That means Goetz is off limits.

60
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:23,056
No threats,
no retribution, no exceptions.

61
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:24,517
Do you understand?

62
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:31,387
<i>One entrance.</i>

63
00:03:34,317 --> 00:03:35,300
<i>Small exit.</i>

64
00:03:35,793 --> 00:03:37,029
Is she going to be okay?

65
00:03:39,578 --> 00:03:41,396
I'm going to need this room clear now.

66
00:03:41,436 --> 00:03:43,160
- Please.
- Come on. Come on.

67
00:03:48,692 --> 00:03:50,042
Beck's gone to New Bern.

68
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,082
We're on our own.

69
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:55,293
Bill, Marty,

70
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:56,972
you take the front.

71
00:03:57,812 --> 00:03:59,593
<i>Greg and Dave, you take the back.</i>

72
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:01,012
Any sign of Goetz,

73
00:04:01,052 --> 00:04:04,166
you let me know
before you do anything, all of you.

74
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:05,222
Stan.

75
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,689
- Taking her to the morgue?
- Yeah.

76
00:04:13,985 --> 00:04:14,985
I'm going.

77
00:04:20,555 --> 00:04:21,698
He shouldn't be alone.

78
00:04:22,457 --> 00:04:23,742
I'll keep an eye on him.

79
00:05:06,798 --> 00:05:10,183
They just checked Mimi Clark into
the medical center for a gunshot wound.

80
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,529
She was in the house?

81
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,320
<i>Mrs. Hawkins, here's your prescription.</i>

82
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:27,294
Hey.

83
00:05:28,652 --> 00:05:29,892
What are you doing here?

84
00:05:29,932 --> 00:05:33,000
Well, everyone under the age of 18
in your house is running a fever, and...

85
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,921
<i>Jake!</i>

86
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,236
Jake!

87
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,120
Goetz is outside.

88
00:05:38,484 --> 00:05:39,776
Stay here.

89
00:05:51,544 --> 00:05:52,344
Jake.

90
00:05:54,638 --> 00:05:56,280
I understand Mimi Clark is inside.

91
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,270
I'm going to need to see her.

92
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:04,946
Jake, don't do something stupid.

93
00:06:06,395 --> 00:06:09,389
Mimi Clark is a witness to
the killings of three of my men.

94
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:11,808
She may have even
been one of the shooters.

95
00:06:11,892 --> 00:06:15,030
- She's got some questions to answer.
- You not getting inside this building.

96
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:18,899
Then I think we have a problem.

97
00:06:22,284 --> 00:06:25,229
"Season 2 - Episode 05

101
00:06:39,688 --> 00:06:42,506
Be very careful about this decision
you're making, Jake.

102
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:44,883
Because if you kill
a Ravenwood contractor,

103
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:48,916
Cheyenne will classify this town
as an insurgent enclave.

104
00:06:49,548 --> 00:06:51,389
When they crack down, everyone suffers.

105
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,950
<i>You don't want that.</i>

106
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,185
Then it looks like it's going
to be a long night.

107
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:57,687
Is this a road you
really want to go down?

108
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:04,879
You come inside this building
you'll find out.

109
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:12,831
<i>Thank you, ma'am. We'll get back
to you at 0200 with another update.</i>

110
00:07:12,871 --> 00:07:14,009
<i>Red One out.</i>

111
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:20,139
<i>Good night.</i>

112
00:07:25,283 --> 00:07:26,133
Heather.

113
00:07:29,457 --> 00:07:30,479
Russell?

114
00:07:32,646 --> 00:07:34,296
How did you get in here?

115
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:35,397
It wasn't easy.

116
00:07:35,437 --> 00:07:38,186
We had to slip past the
checkpoints and armed patrols.

117
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,500
Things are bad in New Bern, Heather.

118
00:07:41,116 --> 00:07:43,112
And you are making matters worse for us.

119
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:45,002
What are you talking about?

120
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:51,417
The resistance in New Bern
has placed a bounty on your head.

121
00:07:51,826 --> 00:07:53,732
We were sent to collect it.

122
00:07:55,004 --> 00:07:56,954
Is there a place we can talk?

123
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:02,013
So based on this report,
I'd say you were

124
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,107
a former J&R employee, right?

125
00:08:06,857 --> 00:08:10,007
Looking to make sure the
company's sins are exposed.

126
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:11,219
<i>Something like that.</i>

127
00:08:11,764 --> 00:08:13,914
So why not just blow the whistle?

128
00:08:15,248 --> 00:08:18,056
- What do you need me for?
- <i>I don't need you.</i>

129
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:19,406
<i>I need your bomb.</i>

130
00:08:20,174 --> 00:08:22,738
<i>It's concrete evidence
that cannot be refuted</i>

131
00:08:22,778 --> 00:08:24,828
<i>as easily as words on a page.</i>

132
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:29,510
<i>Taking on both J&R and the Cheyenne
government will require nothing less.</i>

133
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:33,201
And how high up is the connection
between the two of them?

134
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,229
<i>How high do you think?</i>

135
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:39,033
I think Valente.

136
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:41,615
<i>Think bigger.</i>

137
00:08:45,115 --> 00:08:46,765
You mean the president?

138
00:08:47,582 --> 00:08:50,108
<i>Ten years ago John Tomarchio
was a young star</i>

139
00:08:50,148 --> 00:08:52,598
<i>within the Jennings & Rall Corporation.</i>

140
00:08:53,427 --> 00:08:57,324
<i>The company was a major donor to
his first campaign for elected office.</i>

141
00:08:58,636 --> 00:08:59,659
<i>His cabinet,</i>

142
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:00,982
his advisers,

143
00:09:01,485 --> 00:09:04,592
<i>all littered with former J&R employees.</i>

144
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,346
<i>At the highest levels,
that government and this company</i>

145
00:09:10,671 --> 00:09:12,176
<i>are one and the same.</i>

146
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,113
The barricades are about halfway there.

147
00:09:22,153 --> 00:09:23,250
Another ten mi...

148
00:09:24,685 --> 00:09:26,211
I guess we knew this was coming.

149
00:09:26,251 --> 00:09:28,005
<i>Let's get the other barricades done now.</i>

150
00:09:28,045 --> 00:09:29,695
<i>We don't have much time.</i>

151
00:09:29,741 --> 00:09:31,992
I need an extra pair of hands.
Someone to hold a light.

152
00:09:32,032 --> 00:09:33,552
All my guys are on the doors.

153
00:09:36,027 --> 00:09:37,477
Excuse me, madam...

154
00:09:37,594 --> 00:09:39,348
- Darcy.
- You're hired.

155
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,160
Armed civilians, possibly hostages, sir.

156
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:48,758
Four hours, copy that.
Thank you, sir.

157
00:09:49,573 --> 00:09:51,977
Looks like it's just going
to be the 12 of us for awhile.

158
00:09:52,017 --> 00:09:53,690
Should we start planning for a breech?

159
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,358
<i>Or should we just go to phase two?</i>

160
00:09:55,398 --> 00:09:58,962
By the time Beck gets back here
this thing will be over and done with.

161
00:09:59,002 --> 00:10:00,777
Let's start banging on some doors.

162
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:01,687
Got it.

163
00:10:14,003 --> 00:10:15,083
Is she okay?

164
00:10:15,602 --> 00:10:17,252
Well, she has been shot.

165
00:10:18,103 --> 00:10:20,308
The bullet entered
the pectoralis musculature,

166
00:10:20,348 --> 00:10:24,111
and missed the subclavean
vessels and the chest cavity.

167
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,201
I'm sorry,
I have no idea what any of that means.

168
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:29,567
It means, all things considered,

169
00:10:29,607 --> 00:10:31,791
this situation
could have been a lot worse.

170
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,336
Eleven blade, please.

171
00:10:43,691 --> 00:10:44,964
Hey, Stanley.

172
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:50,592
Stanley, this isn't your fault.

173
00:10:50,947 --> 00:10:52,797
What are you talking about?

174
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,441
Well, when...

175
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,909
when April died...

176
00:10:58,015 --> 00:11:01,365
all I could think about was
I hadn't done enough, that...

177
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,725
that it was my fault.

178
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:07,628
When my parents died I did that.

179
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:10,125
I... I blamed myself.

180
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:13,964
I hated myself for being alive.

181
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,159
But there was this little
girl to take care of.

182
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:24,575
I sort of pulled myself out of it.

183
00:11:26,178 --> 00:11:27,045
I know.

184
00:11:28,265 --> 00:11:29,461
This is harder.

185
00:11:31,305 --> 00:11:34,055
Your parents, that...
that was an accident...

186
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:35,901
an act of God.

187
00:11:38,117 --> 00:11:39,367
Aren't they all?

188
00:11:45,016 --> 00:11:46,566
I don't blame myself.

189
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:53,637
Jake.

190
00:11:53,917 --> 00:11:55,235
<i>What? What is it?</i>

191
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:57,292
I don't know, but Goetz is getting out.

192
00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:58,697
He's got someone with him.

193
00:12:04,528 --> 00:12:05,328
Fred.

194
00:12:12,206 --> 00:12:13,053
Hello.

195
00:12:18,168 --> 00:12:19,718
Gary, it's your wife.

196
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:24,793
Hello.

197
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:26,385
Hey.

198
00:12:27,554 --> 00:12:29,704
Okay, okay. All right, calm down.

199
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:31,557
Yeah. Okay. All right.

200
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:33,481
I love you, too.

201
00:12:38,012 --> 00:12:39,062
It's Chloe.

202
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:40,784
She's outside.

203
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,616
They just went into
the house and got her.

204
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:46,081
Look, I'm with you guys.
I am, but...

205
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:48,030
She's scared out of her mind.

206
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:48,975
You should go.

207
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:50,995
- It's just that she's out...
- It's all right.

208
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:51,835
Go.

209
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:54,383
It's okay, Gary.

210
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,982
They're going after our families?

211
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:22,269
D?

212
00:13:25,357 --> 00:13:26,185
Darcy?

213
00:13:28,227 --> 00:13:29,027
Hey!

214
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:30,165
D?

215
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:31,539
Mr. Hawkins?

216
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,263
Can I help you?

217
00:13:34,794 --> 00:13:36,260
Is it all right if we come in?

218
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,150
Well...

219
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,877
We stopped by a half hour ago.
I guess you weren't home yet.

220
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:43,295
What can I do for you?

221
00:13:43,335 --> 00:13:45,264
Sir, are you related to

222
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,254
Darcy Hawkins?

223
00:13:48,148 --> 00:13:49,305
Yeah.

224
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,601
What's happened?

225
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:53,155
All right,

226
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:56,576
a group of armed men
has taken control of the medical center.

227
00:13:56,948 --> 00:13:59,598
We believe she's among
the hostages inside.

228
00:13:59,691 --> 00:14:00,558
Really?

229
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:04,350
Okay, so...

230
00:14:05,274 --> 00:14:06,424
what can I do?

231
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:09,410
Well, we need you to come
down and talk to her on the phone.

232
00:14:10,906 --> 00:14:14,132
Just try to convince her to leave
a very dangerous situation.

233
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:17,679
I don't understand.

234
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:22,131
If she's being held hostage, how can
me talking to her get her out of there?

235
00:14:22,969 --> 00:14:25,390
We'll explain all of that on scene,
but...

236
00:14:25,926 --> 00:14:27,433
we do need to go now.

237
00:14:29,984 --> 00:14:30,794
Okay.

238
00:14:32,377 --> 00:14:35,080
Okay. I'm parked out front.
I just... Let me just get my keys.

239
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,137
Sir?

240
00:14:37,382 --> 00:14:40,032
It would be best if
you just came with us.

241
00:14:42,978 --> 00:14:43,778
Okay.

242
00:14:52,621 --> 00:14:54,125
Where is my wife?

243
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:08,916
Hey, Mimi.

244
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:14,557
Where am I?

245
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,820
You're at the med center.

246
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:18,909
You're going to be fine.

247
00:15:24,931 --> 00:15:26,487
Where are Stanley and Bonnie?

248
00:15:27,475 --> 00:15:29,524
The nurse...
She'll be back in a minute.

249
00:15:29,564 --> 00:15:31,714
I told her I'd keep an eye on you.

250
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,510
Let me go get her.

251
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:41,236
Wait, please.

252
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,900
Where's Stanley?

253
00:15:48,002 --> 00:15:49,449
Stanley's downstairs.

254
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:52,416
And Bonnie?

255
00:16:10,172 --> 00:16:11,172
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,544
As soon as Beck declared us the
aggressors in the fight with Jericho,

257
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,228
he put us in a choke hold.

258
00:16:27,268 --> 00:16:30,547
Curfews, military courts,
armed checkpoints.

259
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:33,302
The resistance came
together soon after that.

260
00:16:33,342 --> 00:16:35,181
For weeks, we were a step ahead of him.

261
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:38,273
Then, all of a sudden,
he was on to us.

262
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:43,065
Some of those tips
you've been giving Beck,

263
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,400
they've made things very difficult
for us.

264
00:16:47,175 --> 00:16:48,640
They've cost us lives.

265
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,632
The moment Constantino figured
out it was you, he issued the bounty.

266
00:16:55,362 --> 00:16:56,712
So wait a minute.

267
00:16:57,034 --> 00:16:58,788
You're working with Constantino?

268
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,501
Russell, he's a murderer.

269
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:04,919
You think I don't know that?

270
00:17:05,402 --> 00:17:08,506
A lot of reasonable people
are lining up behind him.

271
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,798
Beck's left us no alternative.

272
00:17:14,443 --> 00:17:16,293
So, if you came to kill me,

273
00:17:18,378 --> 00:17:19,928
why am I still alive?

274
00:17:19,968 --> 00:17:23,325
I came here to convince you
to stop doing what you're doing.

275
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:27,400
And to bring back a little trophy.

276
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,140
What kind of trophy?

277
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:32,676
Goetz.

278
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,780
Will you go up and check on Mimi for me?

279
00:17:42,446 --> 00:17:44,250
Don't you think we should both go up?

280
00:17:44,796 --> 00:17:46,546
I'll be right up. Just...

281
00:17:47,685 --> 00:17:49,335
give me a minute or two.

282
00:17:56,746 --> 00:17:57,596
Thanks.

283
00:18:58,421 --> 00:18:59,828
I know, I know...

284
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:17,079
I love you.

285
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:42,539
What are you doing here?

286
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:44,129
We're switching posts?

287
00:20:46,373 --> 00:20:48,023
Hey, I'm talking to you.

288
00:20:51,603 --> 00:20:52,564
Who is it?

289
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:56,865
Jimmy, open the door.

290
00:20:57,494 --> 00:20:58,574
Mr. Hawkins?

291
00:20:59,227 --> 00:21:00,114
Yeah.

292
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,180
I come bearing gifts.

293
00:21:19,437 --> 00:21:22,292
We've got 12 men. From the looks
of it, they've got about the same.

294
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:24,429
They've got three less
than they had before.

295
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:28,286
And that one will come in handy if they
try and threaten anybody else's family.

296
00:21:28,326 --> 00:21:30,988
- They tried to use you as bait?
- They tried.

297
00:21:31,107 --> 00:21:34,091
- Where's my wife, Jake?
- She's helping with Mimi.

298
00:21:34,131 --> 00:21:36,065
Tell me what the hell's going on here.

299
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:40,300
We did a sweep of the area.

300
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,280
We found Burke and
Sloan by the rear entrance.

301
00:21:42,352 --> 00:21:44,191
- They're dead.
- Dead?

302
00:21:44,308 --> 00:21:47,658
- What about Stanton and Bulger?
- Still no sign of them.

303
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:50,296
All right, do another sweep.

304
00:21:50,336 --> 00:21:52,386
I want to know what's going on.

305
00:22:06,653 --> 00:22:07,453
Fred.

306
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:10,866
You okay?

307
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,950
Yeah. Yes, ma'am.

308
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:17,894
Yeah. Why don't...
why don't you go get some water?

309
00:22:17,934 --> 00:22:19,786
Yeah. Thank you.

310
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:28,433
Hey.

311
00:22:37,196 --> 00:22:38,411
Where's Stanley?

312
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:43,174
He's with Bonnie.
He'll be up soon.

313
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,107
Excuse me.

314
00:22:57,361 --> 00:23:00,511
Do you have any idea why
all this might be happening?

315
00:23:03,468 --> 00:23:06,201
Because Goetz is embezzling
money from

316
00:23:06,481 --> 00:23:07,793
Jennings & Rall.

317
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:10,850
I have the proof, my ledger.

318
00:23:10,998 --> 00:23:14,862
Killing civilians they can excuse,
but you put your hands in their pocket,

319
00:23:14,902 --> 00:23:16,874
suddenly J&R's a lot less forgiving.

320
00:23:17,698 --> 00:23:19,047
Zero tolerance.

321
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:24,340
My ledger was at the house.
I'm sure he has it by now.

322
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,552
Is there any way to
recreate that information?

323
00:23:29,106 --> 00:23:31,290
If you had access to the system?

324
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:32,637
Maybe.

325
00:23:56,822 --> 00:23:57,822
Hawkins.

326
00:23:58,816 --> 00:24:00,166
I need your help.

327
00:24:00,257 --> 00:24:02,307
Isn't that what I've been doing?

328
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:05,191
Well, this is a little bit different.

329
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:09,040
It's outside the scope
of our usual conversation.

330
00:24:09,165 --> 00:24:12,315
I have to be very careful
about sticking my neck out

331
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,981
when, where

332
00:24:14,069 --> 00:24:15,535
and for whom.

333
00:24:16,395 --> 00:24:17,765
Now, listen to me.

334
00:24:18,806 --> 00:24:21,021
I don't know what
it is you want from me,

335
00:24:21,198 --> 00:24:24,979
but I know you are not feeding
me information for my own benefit.

336
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:27,417
So I will promise you this

337
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:31,295
if you do not do this favor for me,

338
00:24:31,454 --> 00:24:35,428
then our relationship will end
right here and right now.

339
00:24:37,161 --> 00:24:38,831
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

340
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:47,202
Is there anyone in the J&R
office that you think you can trust?

341
00:24:47,242 --> 00:24:48,042
Why?

342
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:51,468
Because we need to reconstitute
the information from that ledger.

343
00:24:51,561 --> 00:24:54,711
Now, is there anyone that
could help you to do that?

344
00:24:55,852 --> 00:24:57,099
Well, there is someone.

345
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,112
Good. Make the call.

346
00:25:00,656 --> 00:25:02,448
What do you want me to tell her?

347
00:25:02,488 --> 00:25:05,124
Tell herto gather all the information

348
00:25:05,362 --> 00:25:08,025
and send it to this address.

349
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:11,385
This is the personal e-mail

350
00:25:11,425 --> 00:25:14,117
for the director of operations
of Ravenwood. How did you get this?

351
00:25:14,237 --> 00:25:15,240
Don't ask.

352
00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:16,329
Jake.

353
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:19,830
We got a problem.

354
00:25:21,808 --> 00:25:23,158
Are you all right?

355
00:25:24,092 --> 00:25:26,079
He came at me out of nowhere.

356
00:25:32,723 --> 00:25:34,136
Frank, where's your gun?

357
00:25:40,728 --> 00:25:42,770
There's no way he cut through that tape.

358
00:25:42,845 --> 00:25:44,909
No. Not without help.

359
00:25:45,522 --> 00:25:47,458
- One of us.
- Yeah.

360
00:25:54,756 --> 00:25:57,326
Be First, we gotta find
our Ravenwood friend.

361
00:25:57,712 --> 00:25:59,892
How many men have you
got guarding the exits?

362
00:25:59,932 --> 00:26:00,975
Two at each.

363
00:26:01,015 --> 00:26:03,457
But if he starts picking them off,
then Goetz can get in,

364
00:26:03,508 --> 00:26:05,957
and we can't afford to
pull anyone off of Mimi's door.

365
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:09,004
- Jake, we have got to find him.
- We'll find him,

366
00:26:09,044 --> 00:26:11,006
but after that, we gotta find a way out.

367
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:13,647
Jake...

368
00:26:19,891 --> 00:26:20,702
Yeah.

369
00:26:21,295 --> 00:26:22,375
Are you sure?

370
00:26:22,613 --> 00:26:23,963
Yeah, pretty sure.

371
00:26:26,144 --> 00:26:28,440
Well, there's a way
that may become useful.

372
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,151
Jimmy. Bill.

373
00:26:38,366 --> 00:26:41,058
You guys are just gonna
snatch Goetz off the street?

374
00:26:41,098 --> 00:26:42,796
Execute him in cold blood?

375
00:26:43,132 --> 00:26:45,815
I got a handful of guys
out looking for him right now.

376
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:46,737
Russell.

377
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:49,658
What happened to you?

378
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:57,010
Goetz executed three of my neighbors
in New Bern a few months ago,

379
00:26:57,853 --> 00:27:00,003
and this government promoted him.

380
00:27:00,262 --> 00:27:03,136
Beck has been strangling
my home town for weeks,

381
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,630
And this same government
tells me that I'm in the wrong.

382
00:27:06,878 --> 00:27:07,938
I've had enough.

383
00:27:08,266 --> 00:27:09,799
We punish Goetz in New Bern,.

384
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:12,288
And we show Beck that we're
not going away any time soon.

385
00:27:12,328 --> 00:27:14,019
I know things are bad,

386
00:27:14,618 --> 00:27:16,973
but the minute you guys
threw in with Constantino,

387
00:27:17,013 --> 00:27:18,826
you gave up the high ground.

388
00:27:19,592 --> 00:27:21,342
Beck's going to fight you.

389
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:24,732
I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna be helping him do it.

390
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,801
I'm sorry to hear that.

391
00:27:40,085 --> 00:27:41,335
Word of advice?

392
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:44,262
Pray I can get Goetz
because if I don't,

393
00:27:44,475 --> 00:27:47,186
it's not gonna be me that Constantino
sends after you next.

394
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,096
Hello.

395
00:28:05,571 --> 00:28:06,708
<i>Trish.</i>

396
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,180
Mimi?

397
00:28:10,326 --> 00:28:11,888
Trish, Bonnie's dead.

398
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:15,944
Oh, my God.

399
00:28:16,817 --> 00:28:18,032
<i>What happened?</i>

400
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,754
It was Goetz. And his men.

401
00:28:20,884 --> 00:28:22,471
They killed her for the ledger.

402
00:28:23,676 --> 00:28:26,242
<i>Trish, I need your help.</i>

403
00:28:27,628 --> 00:28:29,036
What can I do?

404
00:28:48,953 --> 00:28:50,290
I hope this works.

405
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:51,690
It'll work.

406
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,982
Just have to make it a little bigger.

407
00:28:54,022 --> 00:28:55,272
It's too small?

408
00:28:56,925 --> 00:28:59,174
What, you don't think
I can fit through that hole?

409
00:29:00,334 --> 00:29:02,584
You're gonna want to make it bigger.

410
00:29:11,688 --> 00:29:15,528
<i>Go through</i>
the backup folders in that directory.

411
00:29:15,793 --> 00:29:18,957
<i>That's where you'll find the numbers
that Goetz altered.</i>

412
00:29:19,362 --> 00:29:20,612
Okay. I got 'em.

413
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:22,307
<i>Now what do you want me to do with them?</i>

414
00:29:22,347 --> 00:29:25,826
I'm gonna give you an e-mail address
and a code for the subject line.

415
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,184
Mimi, I am so sorry.

416
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,499
It's not your fault.

417
00:29:35,684 --> 00:29:38,019
Mimi, I am the one who told Goetz.

418
00:29:42,992 --> 00:29:43,802
I know.

419
00:29:47,858 --> 00:29:49,224
Will you do this for me?

420
00:29:51,073 --> 00:29:51,902
Yeah.

421
00:29:54,744 --> 00:29:55,544
Yeah.

422
00:29:55,898 --> 00:29:57,095
Thank you.

423
00:30:16,491 --> 00:30:17,291
Hey.

424
00:30:18,762 --> 00:30:19,562
Hey.

425
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,997
I'm so sorry.

426
00:30:27,037 --> 00:30:28,106
Mimi, stop.

427
00:30:28,146 --> 00:30:29,223
I'm so sorry.

428
00:30:29,701 --> 00:30:30,501
No.

429
00:30:30,915 --> 00:30:33,728
I never should have opened my mouth.
I should've kept my mouth shut.

430
00:30:33,768 --> 00:30:34,847
Listen to me.

431
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,274
You were in danger.

432
00:30:41,521 --> 00:30:44,029
Bonnie did what she needed
to do to protect you and...

433
00:30:44,952 --> 00:30:46,102
you're alive.

434
00:30:51,738 --> 00:30:53,288
Wherever she is now...

435
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:56,469
I swear, she's glad she did it.

436
00:31:20,224 --> 00:31:21,024
Yeah.

437
00:31:43,877 --> 00:31:45,173
What kind of gun?

438
00:31:45,732 --> 00:31:47,662
- What?!
- What kind of gun did Frank have?

439
00:31:47,702 --> 00:31:49,352
Nine millimeter Beretta.

440
00:31:50,707 --> 00:31:51,575
Seven!

441
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,376
Five!

442
00:31:55,394 --> 00:31:57,536
Four! Three! Two!

443
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:11,929
What do you want to do with him?

444
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:14,032
You're never getting out of here alive.

445
00:32:14,072 --> 00:32:15,431
All the exits are covered.

446
00:32:15,471 --> 00:32:16,685
Sure about that?

447
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:21,557
What was all that?

448
00:32:21,978 --> 00:32:24,131
We got a fix on him and traded fire.

449
00:32:24,171 --> 00:32:25,421
Did you get him?

450
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:29,320
No, he got away.

451
00:32:30,191 --> 00:32:31,628
He's probably still inside.

452
00:32:31,668 --> 00:32:34,431
Let's pull Marty and Dave off
the front entrance to help guard Mimi.

453
00:32:34,471 --> 00:32:36,121
Fred, take their place.

454
00:32:37,263 --> 00:32:39,307
They've been there all night.
They need some rest.

455
00:32:39,347 --> 00:32:40,697
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

456
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:52,375
Goetz.

457
00:32:52,785 --> 00:32:54,835
The back door is gonna be clear.

458
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:55,681
Really?

459
00:32:55,721 --> 00:32:57,471
- Five minutes.
- Got it.

460
00:32:57,748 --> 00:32:58,548
Out.

461
00:32:59,787 --> 00:33:00,926
We're in!

462
00:33:42,975 --> 00:33:45,502
- Tell me what the hell's going on here.
- They're gone, sir.

463
00:33:45,633 --> 00:33:47,605
I can see that. Where'd they go?

464
00:33:47,645 --> 00:33:50,474
I don't know. Another exit
somewhere off near the pharmacy.

465
00:33:50,514 --> 00:33:52,464
There are no exits over there.

466
00:33:53,124 --> 00:33:53,924
Sir,

467
00:33:54,335 --> 00:33:56,179
I think you should see this.

468
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:59,231
- What the hell's through this hole?
- Farm equipment store.

469
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:01,161
Apparently, it's all one structure.

470
00:34:01,201 --> 00:34:02,946
It doesn't make any sense.

471
00:34:03,134 --> 00:34:04,564
Got the whole perimeter covered.

472
00:34:04,658 --> 00:34:06,415
Didn't say anything to me about this.

473
00:34:06,455 --> 00:34:09,305
No kidding.
They made you for the mole, genius.

474
00:34:09,938 --> 00:34:12,706
I heard them say something
about moving the woman to her farm.

475
00:34:12,746 --> 00:34:14,840
Hide her there until Beck returns.

476
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,284
What do you want us to do?

477
00:34:16,324 --> 00:34:17,127
Mount up.

478
00:34:17,167 --> 00:34:19,580
Redirect the reinforcements
to the Route 23 junction.

479
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,370
- Catch up with them on the move.
- Let's go.

480
00:34:34,946 --> 00:34:36,096
Are they gone?

481
00:34:37,914 --> 00:34:39,848
- Jake, wait.
- Are they gone?

482
00:34:58,125 --> 00:34:59,075
All clear.

483
00:35:02,663 --> 00:35:03,705
Let's go.

484
00:35:05,266 --> 00:35:06,066
Jake,

485
00:35:06,535 --> 00:35:08,085
Jake, I had no choice.

486
00:35:08,618 --> 00:35:10,451
He said he'd take my farm.

487
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,180
He threatened my wife.

488
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,370
Go home, Fred.

489
00:35:14,105 --> 00:35:16,355
- Jake, please...
- Go home, Fred.

490
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,220
Go home.

491
00:35:26,395 --> 00:35:28,522
Jake, they've got reinforcements coming.

492
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:32,741
They said they're meeting a
hundred Ravenwood men at the crossroads.

493
00:35:32,781 --> 00:35:35,363
8:00 a.m. At Route 23
and Cherry Valley Road.

494
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:37,835
Let's go.

495
00:36:02,907 --> 00:36:04,643
Hey, not yet.

496
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,604
Check your mags.

497
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:42,762
Are those reinforcements?

498
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:43,875
No.

499
00:36:45,155 --> 00:36:46,158
Watch this.

500
00:36:49,198 --> 00:36:50,780
I'm Director Jamison,

501
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,243
Ravenwood Regional HQ.

502
00:36:54,309 --> 00:36:55,939
All you guys saddle up.

503
00:36:55,979 --> 00:36:56,981
We're moving out.

504
00:36:57,021 --> 00:36:59,250
Sir, I'm in the middle
of an operation here.

505
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,506
No, you're not.

506
00:37:00,674 --> 00:37:02,021
Take their rifles!

507
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:11,415
Let's move!

508
00:37:12,085 --> 00:37:13,282
Where we going?

509
00:37:14,095 --> 00:37:15,845
They're being redeployed.

510
00:37:18,983 --> 00:37:20,133
You're fired.

511
00:37:20,478 --> 00:37:22,387
What are you talking about?
You can't fire me.

512
00:37:22,427 --> 00:37:24,470
No, I can't, but he can.

513
00:37:25,122 --> 00:37:26,772
In fact, he already did.

514
00:37:31,826 --> 00:37:32,867
Feel better?

515
00:37:34,742 --> 00:37:36,316
I hope you rot in hell.

516
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:41,446
Leave 'em here.
They can walk back.

517
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:43,619
Roll out!

518
00:38:11,365 --> 00:38:12,945
Now?

519
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:14,686
Yeah, now.

520
00:38:21,587 --> 00:38:22,387
Goetz!

521
00:38:23,513 --> 00:38:24,323
Goetz!

522
00:38:25,926 --> 00:38:27,617
Goetz, I want to see your hands!

523
00:38:27,837 --> 00:38:29,577
Remember, we need him alive!

524
00:38:29,801 --> 00:38:30,918
No way.

525
00:38:42,516 --> 00:38:43,655
Who is that?!

526
00:38:57,505 --> 00:38:59,972
Cease fire! Cease fire!

527
00:39:07,201 --> 00:39:08,357
Hold your fire!

528
00:39:28,758 --> 00:39:31,808
What the hell are you doing here?!
I came for him.

529
00:39:32,259 --> 00:39:33,918
I've had my guys tracking him all night,

530
00:39:33,958 --> 00:39:36,244
waiting for their chance
to make the grab.

531
00:39:36,284 --> 00:39:37,873
- Thanks.
- No way, Russell.

532
00:39:37,913 --> 00:39:39,363
You can't have him.

533
00:39:39,481 --> 00:39:40,618
Want to bet?

534
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,446
- I'm handing him over to Beck.
- Handing him over?

535
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:44,936
If he winds up dead,

536
00:39:44,976 --> 00:39:47,504
Beck will wreak havoc
on both these towns.

537
00:39:47,544 --> 00:39:49,901
He has three killings
to answer for in New Bern.

538
00:39:49,941 --> 00:39:51,488
Yeah, well, he's in Jericho,

539
00:39:51,528 --> 00:39:53,892
and he's under arrest
for Bonnie Richmond's murder.

540
00:39:53,932 --> 00:39:56,641
We're fighting an army
that has more guns than we do,

541
00:39:56,681 --> 00:39:57,957
more men than we do.

542
00:39:58,118 --> 00:39:59,777
What we need is resolve.

543
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:03,162
And Goetz,
he's the fuel for that resolve.

544
00:40:03,714 --> 00:40:04,601
Stanley.

545
00:40:08,334 --> 00:40:09,509
Stanley.

546
00:40:12,392 --> 00:40:13,299
Stanley.

547
00:40:40,569 --> 00:40:41,823
Stay back.

548
00:40:45,238 --> 00:40:46,988
Jake, that doesn't matter.

549
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,425
Whether Goetz goes missing
or his body's found,

550
00:40:50,465 --> 00:40:52,460
Beck is gonna put the pieces together.

551
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,832
You know he will.

552
00:40:55,629 --> 00:40:58,579
The minute that body hit the ground,
this became

553
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:00,297
a whole different deal.

554
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:17,817
So what's your status, Cap?

555
00:41:17,857 --> 00:41:19,382
<i>This sector's clear, sir.</i>

556
00:41:19,422 --> 00:41:21,043
<i>No sign of insurgent activity.</i>

557
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:22,490
Roger that. Out.

558
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:24,591
- What is it?
- Sir...

559
00:41:24,836 --> 00:41:26,713
you're gonna want
to see this for yourself.
