1
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,260
Jonah?

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,500
What's the problem, Pete?

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,720
Mitchell got arrested.

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:19,930
What for?

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,050
Well, we grabbed a couple horses

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,940
you know, from one of those ranches
outside of town and Mitchell got caught.

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,240
Well... Mitchell is an idiot.

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,510
But the thing is...

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,900
the ranch that we were at,

10
00:00:34,405 --> 00:00:36,033
it belonged to Johnston Green.

11
00:00:37,973 --> 00:00:40,860
The mayor's wife kind of got
knocked around a little bit.

12
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:42,765
Not bad, though. Nothing bad.

13
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,968
But... wait a minute.

14
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:48,703
Wait a minute.

15
00:00:50,765 --> 00:00:53,221
Who's idea was it, yours or his?

16
00:00:53,228 --> 00:00:54,161
It was his.

17
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:56,881
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:57,486 --> 00:00:58,610
I apologize.

19
00:00:59,546 --> 00:01:00,720
I apologize.

20
00:01:05,408 --> 00:01:06,653
Apology accepted.

21
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:22,110
She'll be coming 'round
the mountain when she comes

22
00:01:22,575 --> 00:01:26,930
She'll be coming 'round
the mountain when she comes

23
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:30,323
- She'll be coming 'round...
- Knock it off, Mitchell.

24
00:01:33,056 --> 00:01:33,980
Where's Jake?

25
00:01:36,248 --> 00:01:37,520
You better go get him,

26
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:39,660
'cause when Jonah comes for me,

27
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,961
he's gonna want to have a little
conversation with Jake.

28
00:01:43,288 --> 00:01:44,170
If he has to go looking for him

29
00:01:44,175 --> 00:01:46,163
it's going to make things a whole lot worse.

30
00:01:46,165 --> 00:01:47,053
Whatever.

31
00:01:47,396 --> 00:01:48,490
Just keep it down in here, all right?

32
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:50,093
Better tell him to get ready.

33
00:01:50,615 --> 00:01:51,620
In fact...

34
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:54,853
you all better get ready.

35
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,032
Right.

36
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:05,802
Mallo Cups.

37
00:02:06,745 --> 00:02:08,842
- That's what they were called.
- God, I love those.

38
00:02:08,847 --> 00:02:11,851
- The best.
- I always got so much more
candy than you, remember?

39
00:02:11,897 --> 00:02:13,062
'Cause you cheated.

40
00:02:13,617 --> 00:02:15,452
You'd trick or treat the whole
neighborhood in one costume,

41
00:02:15,456 --> 00:02:17,172
then you'd go do it again in another.

42
00:02:17,727 --> 00:02:19,363
Come on, Eric, everybody did that.

43
00:02:19,946 --> 00:02:21,072
Well, except for you.

44
00:02:22,045 --> 00:02:23,873
Jake and I had Halloween down to a science.

45
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:27,950
I was always the bag lady so I could stuff
all of his costumes into my garbage bad.

46
00:02:28,506 --> 00:02:31,112
I think we hit the Stevens' house,
like, seven times in one year.

47
00:02:31,926 --> 00:02:33,950
He did always share his haul with me, though.

48
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:37,111
Just like a little Bonnie and Clyde.

49
00:02:37,436 --> 00:02:38,520
So adorable.

50
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:46,311
Is it inappropriate that I keep
asking questions about him?

51
00:02:46,317 --> 00:02:47,642
Why would it be inappropriate?

52
00:02:48,176 --> 00:02:49,220
I don't know.

53
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,431
Do you have a thing for Jake?

54
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:54,453
No...

55
00:02:56,557 --> 00:03:00,052
- Okay, except, maybe, yes,
just a little bit. - A little.

56
00:03:00,606 --> 00:03:03,182
- I'm sorry, this is really weird.
- It's not weird.

57
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:06,312
Look, it was a long time ago.
Just be careful, okay?

58
00:03:06,516 --> 00:03:07,252
Why?

59
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:11,342
There's a lot of things about
Jake you don't know, okay?

60
00:03:17,676 --> 00:03:18,622
Is that Jake's car?

61
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:27,023
- Oh, my God.
- What?

62
00:03:31,687 --> 00:03:32,493
What is it?

63
00:03:39,715 --> 00:03:41,423
- Good morning.
- Morning.

64
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:46,481
- Can I help... you?
- I'm here to see about posting
bail for a friend of mine.

65
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:48,462
Mitchell Cafferty.

66
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:52,720
Hello, Jonah.

67
00:03:56,206 --> 00:03:57,170
Jake.

68
00:03:58,777 --> 00:03:59,983
Been a long time.

69
00:04:12,605 --> 00:04:14,541
5 years. So...

70
00:04:15,098 --> 00:04:18,282
- I understand Mitchell's been causing some
trouble. - Come on, don't act surprised.

71
00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:20,681
He doesn't get out of bed in the morning
without running it by you first.

72
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:21,932
I'm not sure that's true,

73
00:04:22,677 --> 00:04:23,911
but I'm here to bail him out.

74
00:04:24,615 --> 00:04:26,131
All right, then let's talk bail.

75
00:04:26,358 --> 00:04:29,163
- First you're going to give back
the food you stole...
- Wait, hold on a second.

76
00:04:29,165 --> 00:04:30,372
I'm not sure you've noticed,

77
00:04:30,377 --> 00:04:31,851
but the world's coming apart at the seams.

78
00:04:31,858 --> 00:04:35,013
What belongs to who is getting
to be a fuzzy science, Jake.

79
00:04:36,496 --> 00:04:39,083
- But I'll see what I can do.
- All right, and then you're
gonna stay away from this place.

80
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:43,413
- Not just you-- Mitch, Joe Kelly...
- Since when are you in a position
to speak for this town?

81
00:04:43,488 --> 00:04:46,063
- Do we have a deal?
- Shut up, Mitchell!

82
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:50,462
We have a deal.

83
00:05:00,856 --> 00:05:02,333
Oh, I see you're awake.

84
00:05:02,586 --> 00:05:03,403
Must be noon.

85
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,161
I've been up for a while.

86
00:05:05,448 --> 00:05:06,480
Hey, close the front door.

87
00:05:06,488 --> 00:05:07,921
What, were you born in a barn?

88
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:10,722
Were you born in a barn?

89
00:05:11,035 --> 00:05:13,950
Almost a week you've been here and that
joke's really not getting any funnier.

90
00:05:15,088 --> 00:05:17,253
Found some stale corn flakes in the pantry.

91
00:05:17,256 --> 00:05:19,640
- Since no one else seemed to be eating
them... - Well, knock yourself out.

92
00:05:19,647 --> 00:05:22,520
Here, you want a little milk with those?

93
00:05:23,628 --> 00:05:24,870
There you go.

94
00:05:30,677 --> 00:05:31,522
Oh...

95
00:05:31,526 --> 00:05:32,662
It's still warm.

96
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:34,752
Yeah, it was even warmer when it
was in the cow ten minutes ago.

97
00:05:34,755 --> 00:05:37,941
- And that will do it for the corn flakes.
- Mm...

98
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:41,802
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

99
00:05:42,197 --> 00:05:43,202
Yes, I did.

100
00:05:44,106 --> 00:05:46,140
- By the way, where's the funnel?
- Oh, yeah.

101
00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:48,050
I put it in the random drawer.

102
00:05:51,346 --> 00:05:54,132
I couldn't sleep last night, so I rearranged
some kitchen space

103
00:05:54,137 --> 00:05:56,693
put all the non-essentials
out of the triangle.

104
00:05:57,306 --> 00:06:00,690
- Triangle? - The workspace that
connects the three critical areas--

105
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:02,561
sink, stove and prep.

106
00:06:02,955 --> 00:06:05,571
I was in the process of
having my condo in D.C.

107
00:06:05,576 --> 00:06:07,400
renovated before I got stranded here.

108
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:08,190
You know, Mimi,

109
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:09,942
when I was a young boy growing up,

110
00:06:09,948 --> 00:06:12,402
I always felt like there was something
missing in my life.

111
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,250
Now I know.

112
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:15,601
It was the triangle.

113
00:06:16,116 --> 00:06:17,471
Sink, stove, prep.

114
00:06:18,025 --> 00:06:20,391
We have sarcasm in D.C., you know.

115
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:25,372
These'll do, Bob.

116
00:06:29,986 --> 00:06:32,691
Please tell me that's diet Cream soda.

117
00:06:33,046 --> 00:06:34,931
There used to be a whole case of diet here.

118
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,951
Gracie promised she'd hold on to it for me.

119
00:06:37,077 --> 00:06:38,132
Not to worry, dear.

120
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:40,421
I tucked it away when
we agreed on the price.

121
00:06:44,486 --> 00:06:45,572
Oh, you're right.

122
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:47,800
- It's lovely.
- It's an antique.

123
00:06:49,486 --> 00:06:51,591
Are you sure about this, sweetheart?

124
00:06:53,505 --> 00:06:54,600
I'm sure.

125
00:06:55,157 --> 00:06:58,661
Dale, there's a case of soda hidden
along the back wall next to your cot.

126
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,250
Would you bring it up, please?

127
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,842
You're still sleeping here?

128
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:04,880
Be right back.

129
00:07:14,035 --> 00:07:15,931
- What are you doing?
- What?

130
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:20,063
- You were cooling your thermometer
in that glass of water, weren't you?
- No, I wasn't.

131
00:07:22,565 --> 00:07:23,543
All right, so what if I was?

132
00:07:23,548 --> 00:07:25,323
I'm fine. I'm tired of being babied.

133
00:07:25,408 --> 00:07:28,113
You have a temperature of 350 degrees.

134
00:07:28,116 --> 00:07:29,590
You are going to rest.

135
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:32,431
You are going to take
the pills that April gave you.

136
00:07:32,438 --> 00:07:36,010
You are going to admire this
ridiculous pumpkin with me

137
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:39,482
and then we are going to try to eat said
pumpkin together.

138
00:07:39,488 --> 00:07:43,061
Because we use every part
of the buffalo in this house.

139
00:07:43,688 --> 00:07:46,090
- Is that understood?
- Most of it.

140
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:48,443
But no more meds.

141
00:07:48,445 --> 00:07:49,490
It's been three weeks,

142
00:07:49,498 --> 00:07:52,622
I'm not going to be the reason
this town runs clean out of antibiotics.

143
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:54,062
All right, now you listen to me.

144
00:07:56,593 --> 00:07:59,510
There may come a day when this
town needs you to be a hero again

145
00:08:00,336 --> 00:08:03,485
but today is not that day.

146
00:08:07,182 --> 00:08:08,198
The world's changing.

147
00:08:08,628 --> 00:08:09,832
Don't I know it.

148
00:08:10,105 --> 00:08:12,670
Not a lot of work for a guy
hauling freight these days.

149
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:15,750
The old side business has sort of become
a full time gig.

150
00:08:16,588 --> 00:08:17,900
We could use a guy like you out there.

151
00:08:17,906 --> 00:08:20,503
There's a lot of stuff out on the roads
waiting for anybody to take it.

152
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:22,301
I want your word.

153
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:25,072
You and your guys are going
to stay away from town.

154
00:08:27,285 --> 00:08:28,563
Already said I would.

155
00:08:29,537 --> 00:08:32,141
Ask again, a guy might think
you were calling him a liar.

156
00:08:35,996 --> 00:08:40,140
- And that's my car.
- Well, you left it out there.
- Yeah, but it was destroyed.

157
00:08:40,147 --> 00:08:41,560
Lovingly restored.

158
00:08:42,227 --> 00:08:44,131
I told you there was a lot of good stuff
out there on the roads.

159
00:08:44,348 --> 00:08:46,170
This one I didn't even have to fight for.

160
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,782
Besides, she was mine first.

161
00:08:59,558 --> 00:09:00,090
Emily...

162
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:02,023
- Why are you talking to him?
- It's okay, all right?

163
00:09:02,027 --> 00:09:03,700
It didn't have anything to do with you.

164
00:09:03,936 --> 00:09:07,240
He's my father.
It has everything to do with me.

165
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:11,171
You have no idea how bad
it got after you left.

166
00:09:12,237 --> 00:09:13,200
He was calling.

167
00:09:14,176 --> 00:09:15,530
He was everywhere.

168
00:09:16,136 --> 00:09:17,602
He was coming by the house.

169
00:09:17,608 --> 00:09:18,813
He wanted to talk to me.

170
00:09:18,815 --> 00:09:21,112
He wanted me to forgive him
for what happened with Chris.

171
00:09:22,676 --> 00:09:25,392
I will never forgive him
for what happened to Chris.

172
00:09:26,177 --> 00:09:29,441
- And now you're back and he's back.
- Oh, he's not back.

173
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:31,310
All right?

174
00:09:31,645 --> 00:09:33,970
After tomorrow, he's done, he's gone.

175
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:39,232
- When's it supposed to happen?
- Tomorrow morning at 11:00.

176
00:09:39,818 --> 00:09:43,161
- So, we get the food back
and Prowse leaves us alone.
- Well, that's what he said.

177
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:47,021
- Yeah, we'll see what he does.
- Either way, I think it's
important that we do this.

178
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:50,993
- Okay. I'll run it by Dad.
- What's going on?

179
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:55,362
Get in here.

180
00:09:57,525 --> 00:09:59,322
Gray Anderson's back in town.

181
00:09:59,206 --> 00:10:01,512
- Is he okay?
- I can't believe it.

182
00:10:06,985 --> 00:10:08,523
I hitched... Oh, thank you.

183
00:10:08,547 --> 00:10:09,901
I hitched a ride with a...

184
00:10:10,726 --> 00:10:12,061
with a supply truck that was running

185
00:10:12,065 --> 00:10:15,412
bottled water to a FEMA camp
out near Rogue River.

186
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:17,430
FEMA's running.

187
00:10:17,936 --> 00:10:19,531
Well, that's good, at least.

188
00:10:21,718 --> 00:10:25,682
Well, about ten miles outside of
Topeka, we hit a roadblock.

189
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:30,193
I mean, nothing official, just a couple
cars rolled out onto the highway.

190
00:10:30,198 --> 00:10:32,300
And as soon as we stopped, it was like...

191
00:10:33,048 --> 00:10:37,872
like a dozen guys just came out of nowhere
and yanked us out of the truck.

192
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:44,011
I... fought one of them
and took off on foot.
The driver...

193
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,373
they just beat him to
death right on the road.

194
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:51,801
They killed him for...

195
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:54,331
just a few cases of water.

196
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:02,683
You guys have any electricity
yet, any lights or anything?

197
00:11:02,686 --> 00:11:04,900
- There was a heck of a pulse.
- No.

198
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:06,702
Some simple circuits are still working

199
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,890
like flashlights and
electrical razors, but...

200
00:11:08,895 --> 00:11:11,122
we pretty much lost everything
with a circuit board--

201
00:11:11,435 --> 00:11:12,913
radio, computers,

202
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:14,482
newer cars.

203
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,900
- What's happening in Topeka?
- It's a mess.

204
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:20,861
Nobody knows where the hell the governor is.

205
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,601
And the fallout from Lawrence
hit 'em really hard.

206
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,692
Whoa, whoa... They... They hit Lawrence?

207
00:11:26,697 --> 00:11:30,661
- Wh-Why would they hit Lawrence
and not Topeka? - I don't know.

208
00:11:31,136 --> 00:11:35,072
- What about any other major cities?
New York, DC...?
- Oh, they didn't get New York.

209
00:11:35,587 --> 00:11:36,971
What, New York made it?

210
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:41,601
Yeah, well, after 9/11, they got pretty good
at security and apparently,

211
00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:45,020
NYPD caught three guys
right before they flipped the switch.

212
00:11:46,017 --> 00:11:47,251
They had a rented van,

213
00:11:47,485 --> 00:11:50,132
a 20-kiloton bomb in a steel drum.

214
00:11:51,655 --> 00:11:53,321
And what about DC?

215
00:11:59,475 --> 00:12:00,562
It's gone.

216
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:21,663
Hey.

217
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:24,773
- Did you hear?
- Hear what?

218
00:12:25,476 --> 00:12:26,333
Mr. Anderson's back.

219
00:12:26,337 --> 00:12:27,800
He says New York is still there.

220
00:12:29,577 --> 00:12:30,931
New York?

221
00:12:33,777 --> 00:12:36,083
- My parents?
- They might be okay.

222
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:39,313
My parents.

223
00:12:51,456 --> 00:12:53,512
Hey. Took you long enough.

224
00:12:54,068 --> 00:12:56,201
Your sister went to bed a little while ago.

225
00:12:56,205 --> 00:12:58,270
I'm pretty sure that she still hates me.

226
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:02,001
Although tonight was the first
time she said "good night"
without the dirty sign mixed in.

227
00:13:02,855 --> 00:13:05,460
I wonder if she knows that I
know what that means.

228
00:13:08,738 --> 00:13:09,971
I have some bad news.

229
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:12,972
Mimi...

230
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:18,512
- What?
- Washington DC's gone.

231
00:13:29,265 --> 00:13:31,791
You know, stirring them doesn't
make them taste any better.

232
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,252
So... Cindy Mather is dead?

233
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,090
If she was in DC...

234
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:49,692
then probably.

235
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:53,562
It depends how close she was
when the bomb went off.

236
00:13:54,885 --> 00:13:56,050
And Joel Stafford?

237
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:03,290
He's gonna ask me out.

238
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,173
That's what Cindy said.

239
00:14:08,775 --> 00:14:10,842
Did they feel it when they died?

240
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:15,593
- Joel... Cindy, the Thompsons
next door... - It, um...

241
00:14:17,468 --> 00:14:18,822
it would've been fast.

242
00:14:21,857 --> 00:14:23,953
- And Doug.
- Who's Doug?

243
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:26,753
Mom's boyfriend.

244
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,642
I thought you knew.

245
00:14:37,866 --> 00:14:39,030
Are you out of your mind?

246
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,542
You made a deal with Jonah Prowse?

247
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:44,890
Yeah, Mitch for the food and
Jonah stays out of Jericho. Why?

248
00:14:44,898 --> 00:14:49,552
- Because you can't make deals with
guys like that. - Wait a minute,
we talked about this. We-We agreed.

249
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,992
Look, I know about Prowse.

250
00:14:51,576 --> 00:14:53,942
He hauled materials for Stevens
before I came into the mine.

251
00:14:53,945 --> 00:14:56,542
He was stealing five percent off
the top, intimidating suppliers.

252
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:59,500
The guy did four years at Lansing for
extortion and assault.

253
00:14:59,505 --> 00:15:01,531
You want to negotiate with that guy?

254
00:15:02,237 --> 00:15:03,402
He's got a good point, Jake.

255
00:15:03,517 --> 00:15:07,601
- What happened to clearing this with Dad?
- Look, no disrespect to your father,
but he hasn't been out there.

256
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:10,123
I've seen what happens when people
lose their hold on law and order.

257
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,191
You start striking bargains with the
bad guys, it's the beginning of the end.

258
00:15:13,196 --> 00:15:14,823
Just calm down, all right?

259
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:18,461
We need food more than we need to keep
Mitchell Cafferty.

260
00:15:18,925 --> 00:15:21,462
Now, I'm supposed to make a trade with
Jonah in an hour.

261
00:15:21,975 --> 00:15:25,081
- If I go out there empty-handed, I don't
know what he's gonna do.
- It doesn't matter.

262
00:15:26,307 --> 00:15:29,180
Because he'll know that we won't
roll over for him.

263
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:31,682
Look, Jake...

264
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:34,573
we either hold this territory or we don't.

265
00:15:36,596 --> 00:15:38,140
Eric?

266
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:40,781
Gray's right.

267
00:15:45,795 --> 00:15:47,781
I know this is only half
the soda we swapped for

268
00:15:47,786 --> 00:15:51,531
- but I really need that jewelry box back.
- Oh, sorry, sweetie.

269
00:15:51,537 --> 00:15:52,540
We made a deal.

270
00:15:53,326 --> 00:15:55,033
I just found out my parents could be alive.

271
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:58,501
- They might be coming home at any time.
- Oh, that's good news.

272
00:15:58,506 --> 00:15:59,870
I'm happy for you.

273
00:16:01,515 --> 00:16:03,382
That jewelry box belonged to my mother.

274
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:05,981
Her grandmother gave it to her, it's...

275
00:16:06,687 --> 00:16:09,063
it's worth a lot more than some diet soda.

276
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:12,801
I wish I could help you,
but I already traded it away.

277
00:16:13,158 --> 00:16:15,792
- To who?
- All trades are confidential.

278
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:20,162
No one wants to buy a jewelry box that comes
with an argument about who it belongs to.

279
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:23,101
I'm sure that your parents will understand.

280
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:25,320
These are hard times for all of us.

281
00:16:26,048 --> 00:16:27,362
Okay, fine.

282
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:31,912
Dale, um, could you lock
this up in the back, please?

283
00:16:53,277 --> 00:16:57,092
- Looks like you forgot someone.
- The town said no to the deal with Mitch.

284
00:16:57,096 --> 00:16:59,072
How can I fix this?

285
00:17:50,908 --> 00:17:51,832
Ooh!

286
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:52,960
You scared me.

287
00:17:52,966 --> 00:17:54,592
Hey, that's a good ghost.

288
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,163
Oh, that's for you...

289
00:18:19,535 --> 00:18:21,251
No candy in here, guys.

290
00:18:49,275 --> 00:18:50,201
Gray!

291
00:18:50,826 --> 00:18:51,721
Gray!

292
00:18:53,326 --> 00:18:55,072
Jonah's men just took Mitchell.

293
00:18:55,288 --> 00:18:56,532
They're headed out the front.

294
00:19:16,757 --> 00:19:17,571
Hey!

295
00:19:36,395 --> 00:19:37,173
Hey!

296
00:19:46,655 --> 00:19:48,163
Gray, no!

297
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:58,333
- Instead of what? Starting a
firefight on Main Street?
- I got to go out after them!

298
00:19:58,508 --> 00:20:01,113
- Are you out of your mind?
- This has got to be answered, Jake.

299
00:20:02,788 --> 00:20:04,302
What, are you gonna turn the other cheek?

300
00:20:04,657 --> 00:20:08,473
- How long before you think these guys
are back...? - I can talk to Jonah.
- You can talk to Jonah... Find him!

301
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:10,263
He lived up to his end of the deal.

302
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:14,470
- And why the hell are you protecting
this guy? - I'm protecting this town.

303
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,942
- He can get things we're gonna need.
- What can he get?!
- He can get food!

304
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:20,282
He can get gas, he can get ammo.

305
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,422
Could you get that stuff
if we needed it tomorrow?

306
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:24,220
Could you?!

307
00:20:25,428 --> 00:20:26,493
Because he can!

308
00:20:29,335 --> 00:20:31,043
We'll do this my way now.

309
00:20:39,178 --> 00:20:40,700
You said you could get me a car.

310
00:20:41,526 --> 00:20:45,911
- Is this thing gonna die on me
halfway out there? - Charlotte?
Not a chance. She's sturdy.

311
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:52,573
- So, uh, be careful.
- I'm only going ten miles.

312
00:20:53,316 --> 00:20:54,593
I meant with him.

313
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:56,890
I talked to Emily.

314
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,352
Yeah? What'd she tell you?

315
00:21:01,197 --> 00:21:02,290
Enough.

316
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:19,600
Hey, Darcy,
Allie and Sam got a grill going outside.

317
00:21:19,607 --> 00:21:22,141
I think we're barbecuing Spam.

318
00:21:23,235 --> 00:21:24,633
They were asking for you.

319
00:21:32,186 --> 00:21:33,231
So, uh...

320
00:21:35,318 --> 00:21:36,900
I know about Doug.

321
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:42,692
- What do you know?
- I know that he's probably gone.

322
00:21:43,395 --> 00:21:44,241
I know...

323
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:49,933
- I know that he meant a lot to you.
- Robby, you don't know a damn thing.

324
00:21:54,415 --> 00:21:56,161
So are my kids close to him?

325
00:21:57,606 --> 00:22:00,643
- Why don't you ask the kids?
- I don't want to ask the kids.
I'm ask...

326
00:22:03,248 --> 00:22:04,451
Why did you come for me?

327
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:11,302
- I told you the kids...
- No, no. In D.C., you could have
just taken the kids.

328
00:22:12,588 --> 00:22:14,863
We sat in traffic for two hours
that afternoon on the Beltway.

329
00:22:14,865 --> 00:22:17,541
- You didn't have to wait
for me. Why'd you do it?
- Why?

330
00:22:18,976 --> 00:22:21,952
- You hated me, Robert.
- I did not...
- You hated me.

331
00:22:23,017 --> 00:22:24,993
You blamed me for breaking up the marriage.

332
00:22:24,997 --> 00:22:28,383
And even though you left me for your work
long before I ever looked at another man.

333
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:35,002
I'll tell the kids you're
not feeling too well.

334
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:38,072
Doug and I had been dating
for about three months.

335
00:22:39,127 --> 00:22:40,180
I met him at the gym.

336
00:22:42,245 --> 00:22:43,912
I liked the way he looked at me.

337
00:22:47,307 --> 00:22:51,853
And I liked the way that I felt
about myself when he looked at me.
It was nice.

338
00:22:55,136 --> 00:22:58,013
I was thinking about
introducing him to the kids.

339
00:23:03,017 --> 00:23:08,263
Now I'm, I'm back in the house of secrets
with a man who looks at me like...

340
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,121
like that.

341
00:23:15,816 --> 00:23:18,303
God, Robert,
why on Earth did you come for me?

342
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,433
Quite the runner, Mitch.

343
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:13,433
Hey, knock it off!

344
00:24:15,595 --> 00:24:16,533
Let him go!

345
00:24:17,037 --> 00:24:18,192
Break it up. Break it up.

346
00:24:20,107 --> 00:24:21,110
All right, it's all right.

347
00:24:22,806 --> 00:24:24,242
To what do I owe this pleasure

348
00:24:24,745 --> 00:24:27,271
A lot of people in town
who aren't going to let this stand.

349
00:24:28,057 --> 00:24:29,072
They're angry.

350
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:33,670
They're talking about coming out here
to get him by force if necessary.

351
00:24:36,048 --> 00:24:40,012
Did you ever in your life think anyone would
care this much about Mitchell Cafferty?

352
00:24:40,758 --> 00:24:43,282
Look, you don't want it to come to that,
I don't want it to come to that.

353
00:24:43,835 --> 00:24:45,001
I'm here to negotiate.

354
00:24:45,127 --> 00:24:47,801
Last time we negotiated,
it didn't work out so good for me.

355
00:24:49,326 --> 00:24:52,092
Keep Mitch and keep the food.

356
00:24:52,716 --> 00:24:55,072
You can sell the food to the town through
Gracie Lee's market

357
00:24:55,075 --> 00:24:58,263
and take your cut off the top in supplies
that we have and you don't:

358
00:24:58,847 --> 00:25:00,482
fresh water, crops,

359
00:25:00,797 --> 00:25:02,110
salt from the mine.

360
00:25:02,315 --> 00:25:03,573
I'm listening.

361
00:25:03,577 --> 00:25:09,293
In exchange, you'll guarantee that your...
your business stays away from town.

362
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:13,180
We'll send a trailer to pick up supplies.
You don't come to us.

363
00:25:15,487 --> 00:25:16,681
I'll think about it.

364
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:20,912
Now let's talk about what I need.

365
00:25:25,588 --> 00:25:28,080
- I want to talk to Emily.
- She doesn't want to see you.

366
00:25:28,085 --> 00:25:30,181
She blames me for Chris's death.

367
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:34,721
- Things might be different if she knew
whose fault it really was. - I didn't
sent him on that job, all right? You did.

368
00:25:34,725 --> 00:25:37,292
I tried to talk him out of it.
He needed a lookout,

369
00:25:37,298 --> 00:25:38,550
someone to watch his back.

370
00:25:38,556 --> 00:25:40,420
- You left him alone!
- A lookout?

371
00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:41,893
He needed a father.

372
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:47,332
- All right. Maybe it is time
Emily learns the truth about what you did.
- I told her.

373
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:50,081
I told her, I told her everything.

374
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:56,551
- Did she forgive you?
- No.

375
00:25:57,295 --> 00:25:58,773
Neither do I.

376
00:26:00,235 --> 00:26:01,203
Get her to see me,

377
00:26:01,985 --> 00:26:04,973
- or I'll do business wherever
the hell I please. - I can't.

378
00:26:05,417 --> 00:26:06,813
Then I guess we don't have a deal.

379
00:26:20,118 --> 00:26:21,872
Oh, hey, Eric,
can I borrow you for a minute?

380
00:26:22,618 --> 00:26:24,013
Sure. What's up?

381
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:27,390
Come on in. I, uh...

382
00:26:27,995 --> 00:26:31,492
I am seeing a lot of
unfamiliar faces around here

383
00:26:31,495 --> 00:26:32,943
and I did some asking around,

384
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:40,222
and apparently, there are eight new families
since I left town and 14 since the attacks.

385
00:26:42,308 --> 00:26:44,870
Yeah, some families had relatives come
from nearby towns.

386
00:26:44,878 --> 00:26:48,233
- A few more people from Colorado. Why?
- Do we know anything about them?

387
00:26:48,237 --> 00:26:50,223
Where they've been, what they know?

388
00:26:51,785 --> 00:26:53,842
I don't think I like where this
conversation's going, Gray.

389
00:26:53,847 --> 00:26:55,311
Well, neither do I,

390
00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:59,873
but I'm also sure that we can't
be too careful or too prepared.

391
00:27:06,405 --> 00:27:07,703
You mean Robert Hawkins?

392
00:27:07,705 --> 00:27:09,043
The man has two kids.

393
00:27:09,548 --> 00:27:10,581
He's been nothing but helpful.

394
00:27:10,586 --> 00:27:15,331
He shows up two days before the end
of the world with enough cash to buy
the old Thompson house.

395
00:27:15,996 --> 00:27:17,770
Look, I'm not suggesting anything.

396
00:27:17,776 --> 00:27:22,823
I'm-I'm just saying that we should
know a little more about who
we're sharing our foxhole with.

397
00:27:22,826 --> 00:27:25,243
It costs us nothing to find out.

398
00:27:31,196 --> 00:27:33,680
Is there something you want to tell me?

399
00:27:35,215 --> 00:27:36,341
What do you mean?

400
00:27:38,065 --> 00:27:39,973
That jewelry box is missing.

401
00:27:41,298 --> 00:27:43,633
Did you steal from me, Dale?

402
00:27:45,155 --> 00:27:46,313
Say something.

403
00:27:47,095 --> 00:27:48,462
Why did you lie to her?

404
00:27:48,665 --> 00:27:51,633
- Why did you tell her you didn't
have the box? - We made a fair trade.

405
00:27:51,635 --> 00:27:55,251
I shouldn't have to explain myself
to some spoiled little girl.

406
00:27:55,816 --> 00:27:59,492
- You don't know her.
- Oh, I know her and everybody like her.

407
00:27:59,495 --> 00:28:01,951
They think the rules don't apply to them.

408
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:07,053
I could understand others
trying to steal from me

409
00:28:07,055 --> 00:28:09,621
but after everything I have done for you?

410
00:28:10,058 --> 00:28:13,672
- Everything you've done for me?
- I took you in.
- -And what?

411
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:15,380
You let me sleep here?

412
00:28:15,856 --> 00:28:17,913
I was the one who looked for the train.

413
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:21,393
I was the one who walked five miles
every day dragging food back here.

414
00:28:21,678 --> 00:28:23,363
You wouldn't have a store
if it wasn't for me.

415
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,220
- Dale, honey...
- You know what?
No, I'm done.

416
00:28:26,226 --> 00:28:27,580
Here's your keys back.

417
00:28:29,838 --> 00:28:31,341
Dale, no!

418
00:28:49,856 --> 00:28:50,662
Hey.

419
00:28:52,887 --> 00:28:53,920
Where's Mary?

420
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,452
Uh, Wednesday, night off.

421
00:28:57,545 --> 00:28:59,801
- What are you drinking there?
- I don't know.

422
00:29:00,396 --> 00:29:01,872
I think it might be kerosene.

423
00:29:02,266 --> 00:29:04,090
I haven't quite figured out the still yet.

424
00:29:05,108 --> 00:29:06,810
So how'd things go with Jonah today?

425
00:29:09,535 --> 00:29:12,730
I think I might have gotten us into a fight
we don't want to be a part of.

426
00:29:13,438 --> 00:29:14,372
Nice.

427
00:29:15,437 --> 00:29:17,143
How about you?
How was your day?

428
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:20,313
Well, I think I'm becoming
Graynderson's yes man.

429
00:29:20,977 --> 00:29:23,570
The worst part of it is I'm
not sure if that's a bad thing.

430
00:29:25,906 --> 00:29:27,190
Big day for the Green boys, huh?

431
00:29:29,598 --> 00:29:34,441
- Yeah. You avoiding going home telling Dad?
- Hell, yeah. You?
- Same.

432
00:29:35,687 --> 00:29:39,151
Yeah. You remember that time we set
the carpet in Dad's office on fire?

433
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:40,983
All you had to do was stick to the story,

434
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:41,831
we would have been fine.

435
00:29:42,468 --> 00:29:46,282
- You wanted me to tell Dad I had a seizure
and knocked over his desk lamp.
- Yeah.

436
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:49,780
Any other brilliant ideas
to get us out of this one?

437
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:51,513
Not at the moment.

438
00:29:52,327 --> 00:29:55,942
Well, I say we finish these drinks

439
00:29:55,945 --> 00:30:01,390
go home and try to explain all this to Dad
in a way that won't kill him.

440
00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:12,721
I think you've had enough to drink.

441
00:30:13,797 --> 00:30:14,911
You want to come with me

442
00:30:15,828 --> 00:30:17,683
so we can finish our conversation?

443
00:30:18,976 --> 00:30:22,753
- No, I'm done talking for the day, Rob.
- I'm not kidding, Darcy.

444
00:30:22,825 --> 00:30:26,503
- Let's just go.
- No, all right?
- Not this time.

445
00:30:28,457 --> 00:30:29,861
Why don't you go home?

446
00:30:45,237 --> 00:30:46,121
Hey...

447
00:30:51,108 --> 00:30:53,861
I came back for you
because you are my wife.

448
00:31:13,596 --> 00:31:16,660
Hey, uh, I'm not sure how you feel about
tomato soup

449
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:18,551
but I don't know.

450
00:31:18,555 --> 00:31:20,340
It usually makes me feel better, so...

451
00:31:23,575 --> 00:31:24,450
How's it coming?

452
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:29,190
I've been going over
all of my pending audits

453
00:31:29,198 --> 00:31:33,281
and I can only remember half the details
of half my cases.

454
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:39,242
This one is for "almost there," and
this one is for "not even close."

455
00:31:40,888 --> 00:31:43,643
- You don't need to be doing all this.
- What the hell else am I going to do?

456
00:31:47,915 --> 00:31:48,762
Oh!

457
00:31:52,446 --> 00:31:53,332
Oh!

458
00:31:56,105 --> 00:31:57,332
Get out of my way.

459
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,560
- I'm just trying to help you.
- Well, stop it.

460
00:31:59,725 --> 00:32:00,873
Look, I know what you're going through.

461
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,931
All right? I lost my folks
when I was 18 years old,

462
00:32:02,938 --> 00:32:05,073
and the first few days were, were bad.

463
00:32:05,076 --> 00:32:10,640
Everything and everyone that I ever cared
about was incinerated four weeks ago.

464
00:32:11,328 --> 00:32:13,390
And you mean to tell me
that you know how I feel?

465
00:32:16,118 --> 00:32:19,073
- I'm trying to be nice to you.
- Well, stop being nice to me!

466
00:32:25,148 --> 00:32:26,420
You don't owe me anything.

467
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:33,361
You don't owe anyone anything anymore.

468
00:33:06,668 --> 00:33:08,223
Em. What are you doing here?

469
00:33:08,348 --> 00:33:10,333
I came here to talk to you,
but when I got here...

470
00:33:10,878 --> 00:33:13,041
- Hurry.
- What?
- Hurry.

471
00:33:15,028 --> 00:33:16,651
He went into shock or something.

472
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:21,462
And one, and two, three, four. Five...

473
00:33:22,597 --> 00:33:27,762
1,001... 1,002... 1,003...
1,004... 1,005.

474
00:33:31,816 --> 00:33:34,101
- He's not breathing.
- Okay, one more breath.

475
00:33:54,988 --> 00:33:56,702
Let's get him over on his side. Come on.

476
00:34:06,396 --> 00:34:08,650
I've given him three courses of antibiotics.

477
00:34:08,657 --> 00:34:10,591
It must have been too much for his system.

478
00:34:11,295 --> 00:34:12,630
He's become septic.

479
00:34:14,225 --> 00:34:15,432
How do we treat it?

480
00:34:18,785 --> 00:34:20,192
Wait a minute, April.
How do we treat it?

481
00:34:20,197 --> 00:34:22,451
If the Med Center were operational-- maybe.

482
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:25,733
If we could MEDEVAC him into County Hospital
in Rogue River, maybe.

483
00:34:26,087 --> 00:34:29,350
If we had any heavy-duty meds
left in the pharmacy, maybe.

484
00:34:29,355 --> 00:34:30,521
Without that...

485
00:34:33,286 --> 00:34:34,452
12 hours.

486
00:34:34,726 --> 00:34:35,730
Maybe a day.

487
00:34:38,738 --> 00:34:39,890
I'm so sorry.

488
00:34:39,938 --> 00:34:40,820
What kind of meds?

489
00:34:41,926 --> 00:34:42,812
What?

490
00:34:43,258 --> 00:34:44,621
You said he needed heavy-duty meds.

491
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:45,851
What, what kind would he need?

492
00:34:46,137 --> 00:34:49,203
Something strong enough to blow out the
infection fast.

493
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:51,611
Let his body heal itself.

494
00:34:51,616 --> 00:34:54,361
Cipro, probably, but we ran out weeks ago.

495
00:34:55,577 --> 00:34:57,551
- They'd have it in Rogue River, though.
- Jake.

496
00:34:57,558 --> 00:34:58,881
That's 90 miles away.

497
00:34:59,326 --> 00:35:01,260
- I'd better get going, then.
- Wait a minute.

498
00:35:01,317 --> 00:35:02,410
I'm going, too.

499
00:35:02,578 --> 00:35:03,510
Eric. no.

500
00:35:03,517 --> 00:35:05,551
If Gray's right about how dangerous...

501
00:35:09,376 --> 00:35:10,270
Go.

502
00:35:10,685 --> 00:35:11,772
Go now.

503
00:35:34,135 --> 00:35:35,331
You wanted to talk.

504
00:35:36,457 --> 00:35:37,531
Let's talk.

505
00:35:48,245 --> 00:35:50,853
- You want to sit?
- No. I'm not here to catch up.

506
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:52,952
Jake Green's dad's sick.

507
00:35:54,428 --> 00:35:56,392
- That so?
- Yeah.

508
00:35:57,127 --> 00:35:58,852
I don't care what you think of him, okay?

509
00:35:59,107 --> 00:36:00,723
I'm here to ask for your help.

510
00:36:02,987 --> 00:36:04,491
I'm not a doctor, sweetheart.

511
00:36:04,888 --> 00:36:06,013
No, you're not.

512
00:36:06,325 --> 00:36:07,333
You're a thief.

513
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:12,741
- He needs meds.
He needs Cipro.
- Don't have it. Sorry.

514
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:18,031
But I may be able to help.

515
00:36:29,617 --> 00:36:32,373
- Your mother used to make that same face.
- Stop it.

516
00:36:34,355 --> 00:36:37,590
You do not get to talk
about her. Or Chris. Okay?

517
00:36:41,526 --> 00:36:42,812
I heard you're getting married.

518
00:36:44,056 --> 00:36:45,182
What kind of guy is he?

519
00:36:45,385 --> 00:36:47,651
- How many questions do I have to
answer to get your help? - More.

520
00:36:49,025 --> 00:36:52,521
- What's he do? The guy.
- He's an investment banker.

521
00:36:56,108 --> 00:36:57,070
Emily.

522
00:36:57,987 --> 00:37:01,752
I've stuck by our agreement to stay away.

523
00:37:02,955 --> 00:37:05,681
But the past few weeks,
I've seen a lot of bad things.

524
00:37:05,686 --> 00:37:08,130
I just want to know
somebody's looking out for you.

525
00:37:08,888 --> 00:37:10,283
It's just you and me now.

526
00:37:11,338 --> 00:37:12,343
Your mom's gone.

527
00:37:12,835 --> 00:37:14,743
- Chris is gone.
- Is that what this is?

528
00:37:14,996 --> 00:37:16,661
- Hmm?
- What?

529
00:37:17,055 --> 00:37:18,643
You want us to be a family?

530
00:37:19,305 --> 00:37:21,443
Want somebody to invite
you for Thanksgiving dinner?

531
00:37:21,766 --> 00:37:26,461
If you think for one second
that I would do that again, you're crazy.

532
00:37:27,047 --> 00:37:29,961
I think if you want my help
saving Johnston Green's life,

533
00:37:30,596 --> 00:37:32,732
you got a funny way of asking, young lady.

534
00:37:36,717 --> 00:37:37,991
You're gonna get my help.

535
00:37:38,775 --> 00:37:39,822
You're my kid.

536
00:37:41,508 --> 00:37:44,892
But I think you and I need to
start seeing more of each other.

537
00:37:54,066 --> 00:37:54,871
Dale.

538
00:37:56,046 --> 00:37:58,491
Where have you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

539
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:08,593
How did you get this?

540
00:38:12,055 --> 00:38:13,222
Thank you.

541
00:38:15,448 --> 00:38:17,540
My God, this is what the fight was about.

542
00:38:18,026 --> 00:38:19,380
Where are you staying tonight?

543
00:38:19,677 --> 00:38:21,690
Ah... A friend's house.

544
00:38:22,866 --> 00:38:24,260
A friend's house?

545
00:38:25,828 --> 00:38:26,651
Come on.

546
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,302
You can sleep on the couch at my place.

547
00:38:38,045 --> 00:38:40,373
- I don't think this is such a good idea.
- No choice.

548
00:38:40,928 --> 00:38:42,520
Well, then at least let me do
some work on the car.

549
00:38:42,527 --> 00:38:43,251
There's no time.

550
00:38:43,255 --> 00:38:45,211
- I have to go now.
- What? Wait.

551
00:38:45,216 --> 00:38:48,102
- You said it was sturdy.
- Well, sturdy, yeah, but what if
you need to outrun something?

552
00:38:48,105 --> 00:38:50,121
- Why? How fast will it go?
- I don't know.

553
00:38:50,557 --> 00:38:54,742
30, maybe 40 miles an hour, best
case, downhill, and not for very long.

554
00:38:54,746 --> 00:38:56,942
See, this is what I'm saying. Maybe
you should go on horseback.

555
00:38:56,945 --> 00:39:00,253
- A horse is slower than that.
- A horse is less likely to explode.

556
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:01,532
I'll take my chances.

557
00:39:03,415 --> 00:39:05,410
Okay, well, then, at least open her up easy.

558
00:39:05,417 --> 00:39:08,381
Make sure you have enough car left
in case you need to ask for a lot in a hurry

559
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:11,300
and remember, the gas tank on this thing
is on the left-hand side

560
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,521
so if somebody decides
to start shooting at you

561
00:39:13,615 --> 00:39:14,722
make sure it's not on that side.

562
00:39:15,196 --> 00:39:16,201
Anything else?

563
00:39:35,918 --> 00:39:37,511
Come back in one piece.

564
00:39:38,727 --> 00:39:40,323
I will, I promise.

565
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:47,201
I thought you were gonna go.

566
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,353
I'm waiting on Eric.

567
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:52,301
Oh.

568
00:39:54,298 --> 00:39:55,350
Um...

569
00:39:56,526 --> 00:39:59,712
- Watch out for giant irradiated
hands out there. - Always do.

570
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,241
Okay.

571
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:14,472
You going somewhere?

572
00:40:14,675 --> 00:40:17,973
Yeah, my father needs
medication, stuff we don't have in town.

573
00:40:18,237 --> 00:40:20,173
Jake and I are going to
Rogue River to find it.

574
00:40:20,647 --> 00:40:21,712
You sure that's a good idea?

575
00:40:24,915 --> 00:40:25,773
Not really.

576
00:40:26,706 --> 00:40:28,051
Listen, you be careful out
there, all right? You don't...

577
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:30,380
you don't stop for anything,
you don't even slow down.

578
00:40:31,828 --> 00:40:32,681
I mean it.

579
00:40:34,778 --> 00:40:36,171
We'll be back before morning.

580
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,593
Do you mind keeping an eye on things here?

581
00:40:43,987 --> 00:40:46,241
Of course, yeah, don't worry about it.

582
00:40:52,698 --> 00:40:53,782
Aw, what the hell?

583
00:40:53,927 --> 00:40:55,171
This is what we're driving?

584
00:40:55,636 --> 00:40:57,270
Yeah, I mean, it's not actually a...

585
00:40:57,908 --> 00:40:58,713
Yeah.

586
00:41:01,438 --> 00:41:02,552
What in the world?

587
00:41:03,298 --> 00:41:06,092
I thought the deal was we'd go get the food
and he'd stay away.

588
00:41:06,947 --> 00:41:07,912
It was.

589
00:41:13,707 --> 00:41:14,353
Em?

590
00:41:14,357 --> 00:41:17,563
I couldn't get you the meds you needed, so
I got you the second-best thing.

591
00:41:17,566 --> 00:41:18,503
A fast car.

592
00:41:18,605 --> 00:41:19,770
He said it's a gift.

593
00:41:21,217 --> 00:41:22,811
You know there are no gifts with him.

594
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:28,213
I'm really sorry you got dragged into this.

595
00:41:28,837 --> 00:41:29,880
Nobody dragged me.

596
00:41:30,276 --> 00:41:31,633
Go save your dad.

597
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:37,452
Eric? Load up.
