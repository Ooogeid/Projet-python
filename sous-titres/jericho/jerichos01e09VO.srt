1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
It's straight up 8:00
on a perfect autumn morning.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,070
So get up, get out of bed...

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,630
You heard the man.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,850
Rise and shine, babe.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,580
I thought we were gonna sleep in.

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,300
- We did, got up at 6:00.
- Oh, Roger.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,670
Maybe this wedding isn't such a good idea.

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,660
Still have a few hours to change your mind.

9
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,290
- If you come back to bed, I won't.
- Oh, Emily, I wish.

10
00:00:26,296 --> 00:00:27,380
Got to meet the folks.

11
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:31,030
Apparently, they're not all that thrilled
about their accommodations.

12
00:00:31,036 --> 00:00:33,115
'Cause they're only in the best
bed-and-breakfast in town.

13
00:00:33,112 --> 00:00:36,708
Yeah, well, when you're used to staying
at the Pierre overlooking Central Park...

14
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:43,320
Do you think your parents will
ever get used to a small town girl
stealing away their big city boy?

15
00:00:43,327 --> 00:00:44,022
Sure.

16
00:00:44,156 --> 00:00:46,412
Soon as we move back to civilization.

17
00:00:46,728 --> 00:00:49,362
Right.
Noise and traffic and pollution.

18
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:50,530
Don't forget about the crime.

19
00:00:52,597 --> 00:00:53,761
I'm not kidding, Roger.

20
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:56,593
This is it.
When we're married, this is where we live.

21
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,713
Sure that's what you want?

22
00:01:01,768 --> 00:01:03,121
What's that supposed to mean?

23
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,320
Sure it's what you want?

24
00:01:14,056 --> 00:01:17,702
Roger. Roger! Roger! Roger.

25
00:01:28,117 --> 00:01:29,432
We're filling up the hummers now.

26
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:47,542
- What's that?
- Some one in the window.

27
00:01:47,547 --> 00:01:48,403
There's someone here.

28
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:50,521
Hey!

29
00:01:51,397 --> 00:01:53,331
What the hell are you guys doing out there?

30
00:01:53,995 --> 00:01:55,401
Hey, I'm talking to you.

31
00:01:56,657 --> 00:01:58,462
Sorry, we didn't want to knock at this hour.

32
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:01,423
- Stanley, what's going on?
- Go back inside and lock the door.

33
00:02:03,986 --> 00:02:04,881
You're on private property.

34
00:02:04,886 --> 00:02:06,123
This isn't a gas station.

35
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,540
I'll see to it you're reimbursed, sir.

36
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:10,383
- We work for the federal government.
- Yeah, what kind of work?

37
00:02:10,975 --> 00:02:12,993
Just making sure folks have
everything they need--

38
00:02:12,995 --> 00:02:15,801
medical supplies, clean water, food.

39
00:02:17,588 --> 00:02:19,801
A friend of mine told me to look
him up if we came through.

40
00:02:20,827 --> 00:02:21,913
You know Eric Green?

41
00:02:24,405 --> 00:02:25,801
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

42
00:02:32,557 --> 00:02:33,722
Thanks for the fill-up.

43
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:52,640
Hey.

44
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:56,230
You stay down here all night?

45
00:02:58,456 --> 00:03:00,780
Thought I'd keep an eye out, just in case.

46
00:03:04,837 --> 00:03:09,933
- Listen, Jake, yesterday when
you talked about where you been...
- How'd it go with April?

47
00:03:12,186 --> 00:03:13,811
Did you tell her about you and Mary?

48
00:03:16,085 --> 00:03:17,533
Didn't think it was the right time.

49
00:03:19,177 --> 00:03:20,730
Yeah, it's never gonna be.

50
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:30,852
Eric...

51
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,030
Hey, come in.

52
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:38,860
Hey.

53
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:40,403
Sorry to come by so early.

54
00:03:40,918 --> 00:03:42,853
We were awake.
What's up?

55
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:45,223
Some guys showed up at the farm last night.

56
00:03:45,227 --> 00:03:46,743
Couple Humvees, guns.

57
00:03:47,297 --> 00:03:49,432
- They knew Eric's name.
- Ravenwood.

58
00:03:50,175 --> 00:03:50,910
Who?

59
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:54,020
Mercenaries.
We ran across them in Rogue River.

60
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:56,701
Okay, well, what the hell do they want?

61
00:03:59,618 --> 00:04:00,512
Everything.

62
00:04:13,417 --> 00:04:16,272
- Ravenwood? What the hell is that?
- It's a private security firm.

63
00:04:16,278 --> 00:04:20,700
They hire thugs and army dropouts
They give them big guns and
send them out to play soldier.

64
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:24,042
- What are they doing in Kansas?
- FEMA hired them to evacuate Rogue River.

65
00:04:24,046 --> 00:04:26,613
But now they're in business for themselves.

66
00:04:26,618 --> 00:04:28,270
They stripped the town of all their supplies

67
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:30,561
they killed police and civilians.

68
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:31,470
You've heard of these guys?

69
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:34,023
- Now they want to hit Jericho.
- I think they were scouts.

70
00:04:34,028 --> 00:04:36,862
- Probably want to know if we're worth a
visit. - We should fortify, just in case.

71
00:04:36,865 --> 00:04:39,542
- Shore up our borders at
the most vulnerable points.
- Already there.

72
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:43,073
- I ordered armed checked points
on Cherry Valley Road and Route 660.
- Check points?

73
00:04:43,076 --> 00:04:44,752
Yeah, keep track of who's coming into town.

74
00:04:45,188 --> 00:04:47,611
The mayor was sick, you were gone,
I figured it shouldn't wait.

75
00:04:47,697 --> 00:04:50,163
They'll probably come from the east
across the Tacoma Bridge.

76
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,112
I think we should block it.

77
00:04:51,176 --> 00:04:52,722
My farm is on the other side of that bridge.

78
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:55,831
- And so's 30 other families. - Everyone
on that side will have to come into town.

79
00:04:55,957 --> 00:04:58,912
- It's not safe to stay over there. - Over
there. You want me to abandon my farm?

80
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:01,551
- Jake, you've got to be kidding.
- Just for now, Stanley.

81
00:05:02,027 --> 00:05:03,663
Bill, get some guys together,
start collecting ammo.

82
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:04,741
Whatever they're willing to part with.

83
00:05:04,746 --> 00:05:07,931
- We'll stockpile it here.
- I still have some explosives at the mine.

84
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:09,213
We'll take anything you got.

85
00:05:14,745 --> 00:05:15,422
Morning, April.

86
00:05:15,425 --> 00:05:17,561
I thought I could get
Johnston to eat something.

87
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,661
No, it's better to let him sleep.

88
00:05:19,668 --> 00:05:21,450
Let his body adjust to the meds.

89
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:23,092
Oh, okay.

90
00:05:24,795 --> 00:05:27,323
- You ready for some more good news?
- Are you kidding?

91
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,823
His blood pressure's stabilizing.

92
00:05:29,827 --> 00:05:31,613
And the fever seems to be resolving.

93
00:05:31,996 --> 00:05:33,240
I think he's going to be okay.

94
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,532
Well, that calls for a real celebration.

95
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:43,003
Can I offer you some mashed black-eyed peas?

96
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:44,181
None for me.

97
00:05:44,305 --> 00:05:47,060
It hasn't been a particularly good morning

98
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:48,040
if you know what I mean.

99
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:52,662
'Course, it could be the nerves
as much as the pregnancy.

100
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:55,151
Nerves? You didn't tell Eric yet?

101
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:57,303
Oh, he was just so exhausted last night.

102
00:05:57,495 --> 00:06:00,172
And then he was up and gone
before I had the chance.

103
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:02,993
- Any idea where he went?
- No.

104
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:05,563
He and Jake were both gone
when I came downstairs this morning.

105
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:07,700
Gail...

106
00:06:08,138 --> 00:06:09,220
do you think he'll...

107
00:06:10,606 --> 00:06:12,942
well, the timing just seems so...

108
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,293
You're talking about my first grandchild.

109
00:06:16,307 --> 00:06:18,211
The timing couldn't be better.

110
00:06:19,037 --> 00:06:20,393
Now tell him.

111
00:06:34,346 --> 00:06:35,670
Get as many guys as you can.

112
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,940
There's a farm up the road
with a couple of dead trucks.

113
00:06:37,946 --> 00:06:40,420
- Bring them back here,
we'll use them as a barricade.
- Got it.

114
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:45,020
- You think that'll make a difference?
- It's better than nothing.

115
00:06:45,457 --> 00:06:47,911
This isn't your first run-in
with Ravenwood, is it?

116
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:51,101
Why?

117
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:53,203
You go off on your road trip

118
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,420
all of a sudden they're headed for Jericho.

119
00:06:55,777 --> 00:06:57,602
Would've thought you'd
be more careful is all.

120
00:06:57,607 --> 00:06:59,081
You think I led them here on purpose?

121
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,873
Hey, I'm just trying to put
the pieces together, Jake.

122
00:07:00,876 --> 00:07:01,952
Well, let me make it easy for you.

123
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:04,081
- My family lives in Jericho.
- So does mine.

124
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:06,771
- Everything I do, I do to protect them.
- Same here, man.

125
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:08,571
Well, then let's stop screwing
around and get it done.

126
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:27,711
What am I doing?

127
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:33,260
- Em, you in there?
It's Heather.
- Yeah, just a second.

128
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:42,330
- Sorry to barge in.
- That's okay.

129
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:44,741
These are for you.

130
00:07:45,295 --> 00:07:48,892
- Closest thing I could find
to a wedding bouquet. - Thanks.

131
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:54,840
I'm sorry, is this weird?

132
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,262
You were supposed to get married today.

133
00:07:58,288 --> 00:08:00,030
I figured I should do something special.

134
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:02,020
You know, to acknowledge the day.

135
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:03,461
Maid of honor and all.

136
00:08:03,827 --> 00:08:05,221
Just ignore me, okay?

137
00:08:05,295 --> 00:08:06,891
This is really sweet, what you did.

138
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:08,793
You got any plans for today?

139
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:11,030
Besides not getting married?

140
00:08:11,077 --> 00:08:14,720
'Cause I kind of planned a whole day
to keep you occupied.

141
00:08:15,276 --> 00:08:16,632
I thought we'd start with a hike.

142
00:08:16,715 --> 00:08:20,332
- Nothing exotic,
just a hike along the river.
- I don't think I'm gonna be great company.

143
00:08:20,336 --> 00:08:21,610
Company's kind of the point.

144
00:08:21,613 --> 00:08:24,370
- Keep moping to a minimum.
- I don't really have a choice, do I?

145
00:08:24,656 --> 00:08:25,815
Not so much.

146
00:08:36,252 --> 00:08:37,148
Good.

147
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:39,903
Okay, we're gonna need another car.
Put it here.

148
00:08:40,217 --> 00:08:43,790
Let me guess-- this isn't your first run-in
with these guys either, is it?

149
00:08:43,795 --> 00:08:46,761
- You know, there's only one thing I
need to know from you, Jake.
- What?

150
00:08:46,766 --> 00:08:49,361
Would you even know when
you're in over your head?

151
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:02,503
- Hey, you're back.
- Yeah.
Just for a second.

152
00:09:02,597 --> 00:09:04,263
Got to get this stuff to town hall.

153
00:09:04,725 --> 00:09:06,751
Eric, wait.
I have...

154
00:09:06,757 --> 00:09:08,552
I have something to tell you.

155
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:10,821
Okay.

156
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:19,600
Let's talk.

157
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:26,763
When I, uh... had the divorce papers drafted

158
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:30,612
I did that because I couldn't see
a future for us.

159
00:09:34,265 --> 00:09:35,233
But now I can.

160
00:09:41,305 --> 00:09:42,391
I can't.

161
00:09:43,637 --> 00:09:44,412
What?

162
00:09:44,825 --> 00:09:47,660
Look, the last thing I want to do
on this Earth is to hurt you, April...

163
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:50,963
but I'm in love with someone else.

164
00:09:58,006 --> 00:09:59,673
Who?

165
00:10:00,728 --> 00:10:01,542
Mary Bailey.

166
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:03,440
April...

167
00:10:03,697 --> 00:10:04,823
Look, April...

168
00:10:05,996 --> 00:10:08,280
- April, I'm sorry...
- No, you don't get to do this.

169
00:10:08,366 --> 00:10:09,853
You son of a bitch.

170
00:10:20,258 --> 00:10:24,402
Get the trucks! Let's go!
They're coming!

171
00:10:28,035 --> 00:10:28,662
They're here.

172
00:10:28,937 --> 00:10:30,450
Hey, they're here!

173
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:33,733
Come on, back.
Just run!

174
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:35,781
Come on, hustle.

175
00:10:39,028 --> 00:10:40,772
Keep coming, keep coming.

176
00:10:42,938 --> 00:10:45,940
Let's go, let's go.
Come on, move. Move.
Everybody keep moving.

177
00:10:46,335 --> 00:10:49,331
Check your positions, check
your clips, safety's off.

178
00:10:49,336 --> 00:10:50,261
Come on, everybody!

179
00:10:50,326 --> 00:10:53,492
- Remember what we talked about!
- Nobody fires until I say so.

180
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,101
And everybody remember all right?

181
00:10:55,116 --> 00:11:00,042
The most important thing to do before
squeezing the trigger is to breathe, okay?

182
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:11,983
Somebody here want to talk to me?

183
00:11:16,915 --> 00:11:20,961
Whoever's in charge,
this road needs to be cleared.

184
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:25,293
We're under government
orders to collect supplies.

185
00:11:25,336 --> 00:11:26,471
Breathe.

186
00:11:40,027 --> 00:11:40,871
Cease fire.

187
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:42,082
Cease fire.

188
00:11:44,197 --> 00:11:44,862
Listen up.

189
00:11:45,298 --> 00:11:47,900
We're here on government
orders to collect supplies.

190
00:11:48,218 --> 00:11:50,743
Your cooperation is mandatory?

191
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:52,631
Understood?
Mandatory.

192
00:11:54,937 --> 00:11:58,080
When I get back here,
this bridge better be cleared.

193
00:11:58,325 --> 00:11:59,911
Or I'll clear it myself.

194
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:01,643
You got four hours.

195
00:12:02,195 --> 00:12:03,173
Understood?

196
00:12:04,315 --> 00:12:05,263
Let's roll.

197
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:20,690
What the hell are we going to do?

198
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:22,603
There's no way we can hold this bridge.

199
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:24,022
We're going to have to take it out.

200
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:26,281
I agree.

201
00:12:28,577 --> 00:12:29,531
What are you saying?

202
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:31,943
There can't be a bridge.

203
00:12:39,776 --> 00:12:41,563
I struck gold with Mr. Adams.

204
00:12:41,777 --> 00:12:44,703
- He gave up all that ammo without fight?
- Oh, he kept plenty.

205
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,770
Guy's rec room looks like
the basement of the Alamo.

206
00:12:47,177 --> 00:12:48,883
- Where do you want this?
- In the gun locker.

207
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,521
Eric...
Why aren't you at the bridge?

208
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:52,600
We need to talk.

209
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:58,322
- No way, we're not doing it.
- Think about it-- with the bridge gone,
we can't be overrun.

210
00:12:58,328 --> 00:13:01,052
Until Ravenwood turns around and
comes at us from another direction.

211
00:13:01,058 --> 00:13:03,443
Not before they pass New Bern
or some other town.

212
00:13:03,447 --> 00:13:05,400
- Better them than us.
- This will buy us time.

213
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:09,113
Then we focus our manpower and resources
on securing the other roads.

214
00:13:09,115 --> 00:13:10,473
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

215
00:13:10,478 --> 00:13:12,812
If we destroy that bridge,
it is gone forever.

216
00:13:12,815 --> 00:13:14,171
Do you think we can do without it?

217
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:15,831
What about the farms on the other side?

218
00:13:15,835 --> 00:13:18,551
- Access to the food for winter.
- There are farms closer to town.

219
00:13:18,558 --> 00:13:20,342
Okay, what about the homes you'll isolate?

220
00:13:20,588 --> 00:13:23,140
- Jake, that means cutting off Stanley.
- They'll have to come over.

221
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:27,380
- Look, there has to be a better way.
- Ravenwood is coming back right now.

222
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:29,280
We've got no time.
What do you suggest?

223
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:30,370
We can get more men.

224
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:34,352
- Pull them off the outposts if we have to.
- Send more men out there, you're
going to get more men killed.

225
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:36,690
Bill...

226
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:38,390
lock up the explosives.

227
00:13:38,397 --> 00:13:41,010
- Now wait a minute...
- Nothing happens to that bridge.

228
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:43,393
We can face them with
whatever we can muster.

229
00:13:43,527 --> 00:13:45,731
- How can you...?!
- The answer is no.

230
00:13:57,488 --> 00:14:04,012
Okay, I'm just going to go into Gracie's
and get some trail mix, or, you know,
shoe polish, dental floss, whatever's left.

231
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:10,703
Oh, and if the engine starts to shake

232
00:14:10,707 --> 00:14:12,691
just slide over and gun the gas.

233
00:14:12,825 --> 00:14:14,641
And keep your eye on the temperature.

234
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,602
If the needle hits the red, cut the gas,

235
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,342
'cause you've got about two seconds before
it's about to explode.
Okay?

236
00:14:19,466 --> 00:14:23,022
- Why-why can't I just go in?
- Oh, no, no, no.

237
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:24,490
I don't want you to go through the trouble.

238
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:28,210
Right.

239
00:14:44,628 --> 00:14:46,372
Hey, space cadet, what are you waiting for?

240
00:14:46,607 --> 00:14:47,691
Come on, let's go.

241
00:15:01,495 --> 00:15:02,853
So, this is it.
You ready?

242
00:15:04,456 --> 00:15:06,162
Why, don't I look ready?

243
00:15:06,597 --> 00:15:08,283
Well, you're definitely
dressed for the occasion.

244
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,683
So, yeah, let's roll.

245
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:17,530
What are you waiting for, Em?

246
00:15:20,398 --> 00:15:21,401
Emily...

247
00:15:21,675 --> 00:15:22,723
Emily...

248
00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:27,941
Emily...

249
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:29,733
Emily!

250
00:15:33,506 --> 00:15:36,101
Em... Em, Em, turn it off.

251
00:15:36,405 --> 00:15:38,221
- Turn it off.
- I'm sorry.

252
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:45,193
- There was a truck with
these guys with guns. - Yeah.

253
00:15:48,876 --> 00:15:50,852
Um, we're not hiking today.

254
00:15:51,146 --> 00:15:52,811
Everybody's supposed to stay indoors.

255
00:15:53,088 --> 00:15:54,733
Something's going on outside of town.

256
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:56,291
- All the roads are blocked.
- Let's go home.

257
00:15:56,298 --> 00:15:58,622
Home? They didn't say "home."

258
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,023
They said "indoors."

259
00:16:00,097 --> 00:16:01,213
Heather, I, uh...

260
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:03,203
Hey, look, it's not
the end of the world, right?

261
00:16:04,925 --> 00:16:06,670
'Cause that already happened.

262
00:16:08,697 --> 00:16:09,771
What should we do?

263
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:14,181
We're going to proceed
directly to phase two.

264
00:16:14,986 --> 00:16:17,310
- I found two flare guns.
- Good.

265
00:16:17,515 --> 00:16:19,963
Position a couple of
guys maybe two miles out.

266
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:21,123
Give them the flare guns.

267
00:16:21,218 --> 00:16:24,162
Tell them to send up a signal
when they have Ravenwood in sight.

268
00:16:24,828 --> 00:16:28,363
Gray, I'm going to round up as
much diesel and fertilizer as I can.

269
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,883
I'll meet you back at the bridge.

270
00:16:31,985 --> 00:16:33,421
He's making explosives?

271
00:16:34,168 --> 00:16:36,611
- So you're blowing it anyway?
- That's right.

272
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:41,393
Look, Jake, you got loyalty to your brother
and your family, I get that.

273
00:16:41,396 --> 00:16:42,921
So if you want to bow out,
no one will blame you.

274
00:16:42,927 --> 00:16:44,281
But that bridge is coming down.

275
00:16:45,845 --> 00:16:46,481
Where are you going?

276
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:49,433
Someone's got to tell those people
who live out there to come over.

277
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:53,950
- So this is phase two?
- Yep.

278
00:16:54,035 --> 00:16:56,440
Hey, you guys here about
that thing at Tacoma Bridge?

279
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:59,791
Yeah, why do you think we nixed
the healthy portion of today's program?
Keys please.

280
00:17:01,638 --> 00:17:03,232
Uh, I don't know what that plan is

281
00:17:03,705 --> 00:17:04,682
but I don't know if it's such a good idea.

282
00:17:04,685 --> 00:17:06,621
What exactly is the plan?

283
00:17:06,755 --> 00:17:12,030
This may be the last bottle of single
malt Scotch Kansas sees in a long time.

284
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:15,421
You say the word, we open it.

285
00:17:15,685 --> 00:17:18,993
But if we do, you're not leaving
till it's finished.

286
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:22,343
So phase two is that we get
completely obliterated?

287
00:17:22,618 --> 00:17:23,583
More or less

288
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:25,083
Works for me.

289
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:28,780
He's been here since this morning.

290
00:17:28,788 --> 00:17:29,743
I felt bad for him.

291
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,650
It sounds like he's had
a rough couple of weeks.

292
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:33,683
Ladies.

293
00:17:38,008 --> 00:17:39,130
So what do you say?

294
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,931
I say what the hell.

295
00:17:44,298 --> 00:17:45,163
That's my girl.

296
00:17:58,687 --> 00:18:00,360
Who's on lookout for the flares?

297
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,002
Stanton Broksmier.

298
00:18:05,456 --> 00:18:06,802
You're blowing up the bridge?

299
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:07,980
The Millers will be here in an hour.

300
00:18:07,985 --> 00:18:09,172
They got their old Nova working.

301
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:10,152
You can ride with them.

302
00:18:10,446 --> 00:18:12,583
- Go pack your bag.
- No.

303
00:18:12,897 --> 00:18:14,681
Don't argue with me.

304
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:17,592
When that car gets here,
you're going to be in it.
Now go.

305
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:19,323
And what about you?

306
00:18:19,657 --> 00:18:20,570
I'm staying.

307
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:21,703
Don't be stupid, Stanley.

308
00:18:21,706 --> 00:18:22,482
They're coming back.

309
00:18:22,486 --> 00:18:23,491
Jake, I'll hold them off.

310
00:18:23,496 --> 00:18:24,503
I did it before.

311
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:27,841
Look, it's going to be a
couple of guys this time.

312
00:18:28,127 --> 00:18:30,020
They left a pile of bodies in Rogue River.

313
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,271
You want to wind up like that?

314
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:35,133
Stanley, please don't get yourself
killed for a house.

315
00:18:36,107 --> 00:18:39,363
Hey, my grandfather built this house
from the ground up.

316
00:18:39,606 --> 00:18:41,190
And that room you've been sleeping in...

317
00:18:41,198 --> 00:18:43,262
That was my dad's room when he was a kid.

318
00:18:44,197 --> 00:18:45,591
They put that in your audit file?

319
00:18:47,347 --> 00:18:48,980
I'm not about to give it up without a fight.

320
00:18:49,956 --> 00:18:52,552
If we had guardsmen,
people who were trained--

321
00:18:52,555 --> 00:18:54,503
we could take a stand, but we don't.

322
00:18:54,898 --> 00:18:58,232
Once we blow that bridge, everyone who's
on this side of it is on their own.

323
00:18:58,627 --> 00:19:00,612
Okay, so go warn people.

324
00:19:01,117 --> 00:19:02,482
You're wasting time here.

325
00:19:12,505 --> 00:19:14,052
They're here.
Get your stuff.

326
00:19:14,055 --> 00:19:16,743
I'm not leaving.
This is my home, too.

327
00:19:16,747 --> 00:19:19,890
- Bonnie, it is not safe for you here.
- I'm not afraid.

328
00:19:20,016 --> 00:19:23,601
- Bonnie... don't argue with me.
- We'll be okay if we stay together.

329
00:19:23,606 --> 00:19:24,491
Stanley.

330
00:19:28,738 --> 00:19:31,443
- She's not going?
- I can't force her.

331
00:19:31,717 --> 00:19:34,531
You're risking her life-- and yours.

332
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:38,133
- I don't get it, Stanley.
- Because it's not your family.

333
00:19:38,957 --> 00:19:41,040
Bonnie grew up in this house, we both did.

334
00:19:42,028 --> 00:19:47,260
This house is her only connection to a
mother and father she barely even remembers.

335
00:19:47,267 --> 00:19:50,423
That's funny, I though you were
that connection.

336
00:19:56,757 --> 00:19:57,530
Good luck.

337
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:04,250
Skoal.

338
00:20:08,428 --> 00:20:09,813
Ah!

339
00:20:11,996 --> 00:20:12,932
Oh...

340
00:20:13,447 --> 00:20:14,263
Whoa.

341
00:20:15,318 --> 00:20:16,652
This is your captain speaking.

342
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:19,841
- We are experiencing minor turbulence.
- Are you okay?

343
00:20:19,978 --> 00:20:21,260
I am awesome.

344
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:24,823
Hey.
You there.

345
00:20:25,298 --> 00:20:26,922
Mr. Dark and Intriguing.

346
00:20:27,588 --> 00:20:31,203
Keep my friend company till I get back
and there's a shot in it for you.

347
00:20:35,448 --> 00:20:37,192
Your friend is spicy, huh?

348
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,153
May I?

349
00:20:45,398 --> 00:20:48,233
- So it's your birthday?
- No.

350
00:20:48,238 --> 00:20:49,492
I...

351
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:51,983
No.

352
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:54,850
To privacy then.

353
00:21:04,147 --> 00:21:05,422
Pretty bad out there, isn't it?

354
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:10,100
Oh, poverty, murder, disease.

355
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:11,851
It's bloody miserable.

356
00:21:14,538 --> 00:21:16,051
Sorry. Sorry.

357
00:21:16,987 --> 00:21:21,861
- I am drunk, and I haven't slept in weeks.
- Me, too.

358
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:28,412
- Sent everything out, right?
- The last box just went out on the truck.

359
00:21:28,736 --> 00:21:30,872
Bill, what's going on here?

360
00:21:32,585 --> 00:21:33,581
I'm sorry, Eric.

361
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,380
I got this, Bill.

362
00:21:37,645 --> 00:21:40,411
- Where the hell's the dynamite?!
- The decisions been made.

363
00:21:40,498 --> 00:21:46,312
- We're blowing the bridge.
- Who's "we"? - Myself, Robert Hawkins,
the deputies... and your brother.

364
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,613
- Hey.
- I've got to talk to Dad.

365
00:21:53,656 --> 00:21:57,460
- No, you will talk to me right now.
- I don't have time.

366
00:21:57,465 --> 00:21:58,472
April told me.

367
00:21:58,595 --> 00:22:04,032
- Mom, I didn't mean for things to
turn out this way. - Oh, really? How
did you mean for things to turn out?

368
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:06,173
You're the one who chose not
to work on your marriage.

369
00:22:06,175 --> 00:22:09,502
- You're the one who chose
to cheat on your wife.
- I am trying to do the right thing.

370
00:22:09,506 --> 00:22:11,910
- I know it doesn't seem that way
right now... - What's going on?

371
00:22:12,236 --> 00:22:13,782
- Johnston...
- Dad...

372
00:22:13,976 --> 00:22:17,121
The mercenaries from Rogue River,
they followed us back.

373
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:21,280
We have a checkpoint at the Tacoma
Bridge and I think we can defend it

374
00:22:21,445 --> 00:22:24,862
but there's this plan to destroy
it and cut off the town.

375
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:26,461
Gray Anderson?

376
00:22:26,926 --> 00:22:28,793
Yeah, he's out there right now wiring it.

377
00:22:28,796 --> 00:22:31,550
- Where are Jimmy and Bill?
- Out there helping Gray.

378
00:22:31,826 --> 00:22:34,780
- Dad, I'm alone I'm this one.
- Get your brother and stop them.

379
00:22:35,018 --> 00:22:36,342
Jake is with them, too.

380
00:22:39,455 --> 00:22:42,753
Then you stop them.
Whatever it takes, you stop them.

381
00:22:43,535 --> 00:22:45,511
Whatever it takes.

382
00:22:49,507 --> 00:22:52,413
- How's it coming?
- Just a few wires left.

383
00:22:54,017 --> 00:22:54,871
Hurry guys.

384
00:22:56,695 --> 00:23:00,112
All right, everybody, keep it moving!
We got to keep up the pace.

385
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,751
We gotta keep moving.

386
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:06,280
- We see that flare,
it's going to be too late.
- John, I need to borrow your truck. Please.

387
00:23:08,338 --> 00:23:10,030
We don't have much time, folks.

388
00:23:10,037 --> 00:23:10,860
All right, good.

389
00:23:10,865 --> 00:23:11,872
Hold on to that.

390
00:23:12,135 --> 00:23:14,070
Make sure the lines don't cross.

391
00:23:14,077 --> 00:23:16,561
- Keep the gold away from the blue.
- Jake.

392
00:23:18,437 --> 00:23:20,651
Got it. Yeah, yeah.

393
00:23:21,736 --> 00:23:23,820
Eric...
Here, run this to the trunk.

394
00:23:24,408 --> 00:23:27,372
- Dad wants this stopped. - Well,
Dad doesn't have all the information.

395
00:23:27,378 --> 00:23:30,062
- It's still his call, Jake.
- Well, here's not here to make it.

396
00:23:30,388 --> 00:23:31,083
Eric...

397
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:33,221
What are you doing?

398
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,172
- What are you doing?
- I'm putting an end to this.

399
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:38,032
We could see that flare any minute.

400
00:23:38,738 --> 00:23:39,750
You'll be cut off.

401
00:23:39,775 --> 00:23:41,001
You can't go out there, all right?

402
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,023
Eric!

403
00:24:03,887 --> 00:24:04,783
Oh, my God.

404
00:24:05,288 --> 00:24:06,253
That's the flare!

405
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,403
- They're coming!
- We got two minutes.
- Ravenwood is coming.

406
00:24:09,418 --> 00:24:10,502
Still have to run the trunk line.

407
00:24:10,748 --> 00:24:11,952
Eric's out there.

408
00:24:13,325 --> 00:24:14,520
There's no time, Jake.

409
00:24:17,175 --> 00:24:18,412
Get everybody off the bridge.

410
00:24:18,605 --> 00:24:20,663
- Get as far away as you can.
- What are you doing?

411
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:22,412
Go! Go now! Go!

412
00:24:22,797 --> 00:24:23,812
Come on, guys!

413
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,800
Come on! Everybody off the bridge!

414
00:24:26,807 --> 00:24:30,650
Get as far away as you can!
We're gonna do it!
We're gonna blow it!

415
00:24:31,058 --> 00:24:31,761
Come on!

416
00:24:36,587 --> 00:24:39,380
Not bad. Not bad this time.

417
00:24:39,655 --> 00:24:41,712
So I had just... just started my practice.

418
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:44,702
- Been in the country for about six months.
- Where?

419
00:24:45,408 --> 00:24:46,881
Las Vegas.

420
00:24:48,188 --> 00:24:49,782
Don't laugh. Don't laugh.

421
00:24:50,018 --> 00:24:50,892
It's a wonderful town.

422
00:24:50,977 --> 00:24:52,220
It's really a wonderful place.

423
00:24:53,938 --> 00:24:56,651
It's not quite so wonderful
without water and electricity.

424
00:24:57,256 --> 00:25:00,210
Practically threw myself
at the Red Cross to get out.

425
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:04,993
A noble gesture, designed to save
my own ass.

426
00:25:06,445 --> 00:25:07,742
You did what you had to do.

427
00:25:08,368 --> 00:25:12,953
So, they sent me to Kansas, and here I am.

428
00:25:13,025 --> 00:25:19,793
I really should be sitting by a pool
surrounded by beautiful women.

429
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:24,303
Redheads, preferably.
And blondes. Blondes, too.

430
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:29,480
Yeah, smoking a cigar,
living the American dream.

431
00:25:32,556 --> 00:25:35,372
- I was supposed to be married today.
- Really?

432
00:25:36,528 --> 00:25:39,651
I was going to be right...
right over there.

433
00:25:39,856 --> 00:25:42,410
Feet kicked up, having a drink.

434
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,001
- Emily!
- Yeah?

435
00:25:54,006 --> 00:25:56,220
- What do you want to hear next?
- Same one.

436
00:25:57,325 --> 00:26:00,281
"Polyester Bride" on endless loop?

437
00:26:00,286 --> 00:26:03,162
Are you being ironic on your wedding day,
Emily Sullivan?

438
00:26:03,168 --> 00:26:05,922
If I was being ironic, it would Alanis.

439
00:26:05,927 --> 00:26:10,200
And it's Emily Hammond in, like,
30 minutes.

440
00:26:13,956 --> 00:26:15,620
Hey, hold on there.

441
00:26:15,758 --> 00:26:17,152
We need extra hands, okay?

442
00:26:17,816 --> 00:26:20,182
Heather, there's no way I can
leave with the bar this busy.

443
00:26:20,186 --> 00:26:23,260
- Can you hold the phone up during
the wedding so I can hear?
- Got you programmed.

444
00:26:24,526 --> 00:26:27,122
- Hey, Stanley, when are you
getting dressed? - After the game.

445
00:26:27,326 --> 00:26:29,222
The wedding is in a half an hour.

446
00:26:29,348 --> 00:26:32,290
Oh! Overtime?! Why?!

447
00:26:38,035 --> 00:26:39,900
Before we head over to the church

448
00:26:40,025 --> 00:26:43,322
I'd like to make a toast to the
blushing bride and banker boy.

449
00:26:45,195 --> 00:26:46,083
Banker man.

450
00:26:46,157 --> 00:26:48,333
Well, it's a banker any way you slice it.

451
00:26:48,377 --> 00:26:50,790
Who here would have ever matched Roger
with Emily?

452
00:26:50,997 --> 00:26:52,512
Talk about high-risk investment.

453
00:26:52,796 --> 00:26:54,421
There's nothing risky about him.

454
00:26:54,775 --> 00:26:55,633
Exactly.

455
00:26:58,208 --> 00:26:59,670
To Emily and Roger.

456
00:27:01,238 --> 00:27:04,420
May they live happily together
in eternal blandness.

457
00:27:04,776 --> 00:27:06,452
Never questioning their life

458
00:27:07,205 --> 00:27:08,720
never looking too closely.

459
00:27:09,977 --> 00:27:12,770
Never wondering if they weren't meant
for something else.

460
00:27:16,245 --> 00:27:17,761
Down the hatch, everybody.

461
00:27:25,197 --> 00:27:26,281
To the future.

462
00:27:28,228 --> 00:27:29,352
Rest in peace.

463
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:10,961
What does he think he's doing?

464
00:28:11,706 --> 00:28:13,143
He's making a stand.

465
00:28:15,555 --> 00:28:16,761
The bridge is wired.

466
00:28:17,187 --> 00:28:19,671
You just parked over a couple
of pounds of dynamite.

467
00:28:20,997 --> 00:28:22,823
Turn your trucks around or I blow it.

468
00:28:27,107 --> 00:28:33,241
We're on government orders to
collect food and medicine for a
refuge camp near the Rogue River.

469
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:38,773
Same government that ordered you
to kill all those people in the hospital?

470
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:40,480
It's been a crazy few weeks.

471
00:28:40,578 --> 00:28:41,860
A lot of confusion out there.

472
00:28:43,048 --> 00:28:46,462
Just step aside, we'll take what
we need and be on our way.

473
00:29:01,745 --> 00:29:04,193
Go ahead.
give the order.

474
00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:06,683
If I go, you go.

475
00:29:13,215 --> 00:29:14,413
Is something funny?

476
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:17,330
Yeah, this whole thing.

477
00:29:18,155 --> 00:29:19,741
You're not going to push that button.

478
00:29:22,486 --> 00:29:23,612
Here's how it's going to go.

479
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:28,483
You and your farmer buddies,
you stand down, we get back in our vehicles,

480
00:29:28,676 --> 00:29:33,260
we drive into town take what we need
and never come back.

481
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:35,490
Nobody has to die.

482
00:29:38,786 --> 00:29:39,601
Man down!

483
00:29:40,007 --> 00:29:40,903
Man down!

484
00:30:13,635 --> 00:30:15,891
You're gonna need a lot more snipers, pal.

485
00:30:17,846 --> 00:30:18,892
We got cars coming!

486
00:30:20,598 --> 00:30:21,960
Get in positions, now!

487
00:30:30,848 --> 00:30:33,681
- Is that Jonah Prowse?
- What the hell's he doing here?

488
00:30:49,976 --> 00:30:51,790
What's this town worth to you?

489
00:30:55,756 --> 00:31:00,240
You know, pretty soon, things are going
to start to get back to normal.

490
00:31:00,947 --> 00:31:03,070
The government will put
itself back together.

491
00:31:03,815 --> 00:31:07,391
And they'll be looking to help
all of you get back on your feet.

492
00:31:10,006 --> 00:31:11,360
And you know who they're going to send?

493
00:31:12,255 --> 00:31:13,221
Me.

494
00:31:17,726 --> 00:31:18,621
Let's go!

495
00:31:41,756 --> 00:31:44,282
Next time you want to destroy my
route into town

496
00:31:44,288 --> 00:31:45,920
I'd appreciate a head's up.

497
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:50,583
You're welcome.

498
00:31:52,107 --> 00:31:54,373
Really.
Don't mention it.

499
00:31:58,808 --> 00:32:00,552
Can I make a suggestion?

500
00:32:01,566 --> 00:32:03,890
Start figuring out how to
fight for yourselves.

501
00:32:04,517 --> 00:32:08,050
If Eric hadn't come to get me, you'd
all be burying Jake in a shoebox tomorrow.

502
00:32:35,668 --> 00:32:37,372
So is this how it's going to be?

503
00:32:38,896 --> 00:32:43,980
Drunken days, lonely nights,
disturbing visions of a dead fiance?

504
00:32:44,767 --> 00:32:45,900
Are you...?

505
00:32:47,035 --> 00:32:48,000
What?

506
00:32:48,745 --> 00:32:49,713
Dead?

507
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:51,711
Would that make it easier?

508
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:54,023
No.

509
00:32:55,028 --> 00:32:55,883
I don't know.

510
00:32:56,588 --> 00:32:59,261
I don't even know what your voice
sounds like, it's been so long.

511
00:33:01,227 --> 00:33:03,211
I should have been on the plane with you.

512
00:33:04,155 --> 00:33:05,813
You never would have left this place.

513
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,951
Ever ask yourself why?

514
00:33:12,895 --> 00:33:14,722
Brother, mother gone.

515
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,093
No father to speak of.

516
00:33:20,107 --> 00:33:23,053
What is it that keeps
you so tied to Jericho?

517
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:25,343
I don't know.

518
00:33:36,705 --> 00:33:37,590
I think you do.

519
00:33:39,505 --> 00:33:40,353
Em?

520
00:33:41,907 --> 00:33:42,951
You okay?

521
00:33:47,806 --> 00:33:50,800
- What happens if they come back?
- Yeah!

522
00:33:50,805 --> 00:33:55,622
- We've got armed sentries posted.
- If it comes to it,
the bridge is still wired.

523
00:33:56,336 --> 00:33:58,513
I still say we take it out now.

524
00:33:59,755 --> 00:34:01,783
Well, you're not calling the shots, Gray.

525
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:08,621
- I'm glad to see you up on
your feet, Johnston. - Mayor.

526
00:34:12,638 --> 00:34:19,052
Now, maybe one of you would
like to tell me just exactly
who you think is in charge here.

527
00:34:21,235 --> 00:34:26,163
If we're hit from the other side, that
bridge might be our only line of retreat.

528
00:34:27,336 --> 00:34:29,782
Help is on the other side of that bridge.

529
00:34:30,566 --> 00:34:34,930
Our people-- the whole world--
is on the other side of that bridge.

530
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:39,452
We destroy that bridge, we've already lost.

531
00:34:40,436 --> 00:34:42,382
Everyone here wants this to happen.

532
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:44,950
Including your son.

533
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:48,040
No.
Not everyone.

534
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:51,793
You guys come up with a real plan
to protect this town, you let me know.

535
00:34:58,277 --> 00:35:01,343
- Dad, I think you should...
- You hold your tongue.

536
00:35:02,826 --> 00:35:05,341
I'm the only one here who was elected.

537
00:35:05,556 --> 00:35:08,872
I will not do this.
It is as simple as that.

538
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:13,002
Maybe it's time we let the people decide if
they still want you making their decisions.

539
00:35:16,106 --> 00:35:17,030
Stanley?

540
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:22,170
No, she can't. She can't.

541
00:35:22,726 --> 00:35:24,271
You're an idiot.

542
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:30,073
Yeah. She said it's fine with her.

543
00:35:32,536 --> 00:35:33,422
Right.

544
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:42,192
I'll be outside.

545
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:50,960
I kind of put you in a bad
position out there, huh?

546
00:35:50,965 --> 00:35:52,971
Gray used you, son.
I hope you see that.

547
00:35:52,977 --> 00:35:55,432
Dad, you didn't see what those guys
are capable of.

548
00:35:58,598 --> 00:36:00,732
- But I'm not here to fight.
- What are you here for?

549
00:36:01,455 --> 00:36:03,321
We need a security force.

550
00:36:05,617 --> 00:36:07,243
A real one. Trained.

551
00:36:07,486 --> 00:36:08,880
Sanctioned by you.

552
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,671
This belonged to your grandfather.

553
00:36:26,187 --> 00:36:28,631
He had it on him when he landed at D-day.

554
00:36:31,825 --> 00:36:34,392
When he had to take command of his platoon,

555
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:39,173
that manual and his training got him
from Omaha Beach into Germany.

556
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:40,661
I remember the story.

557
00:36:45,365 --> 00:36:46,880
Make sure you do it right.

558
00:37:00,957 --> 00:37:02,350
I'm not coming home tonight.

559
00:37:04,457 --> 00:37:06,363
I'll stop by tomorrow and pack some clothes.

560
00:37:13,145 --> 00:37:18,351
- Look, Mom, April... - Will have a
home with us as long as she wants one.

561
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,791
Thanks, Jimmy.

562
00:38:34,487 --> 00:38:35,493
We did good today.

563
00:38:36,827 --> 00:38:37,603
No.

564
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:40,863
No, we just got lucky.

565
00:38:56,628 --> 00:38:57,730
Emily?

566
00:39:00,216 --> 00:39:01,842
Is everything all right?

567
00:39:02,746 --> 00:39:03,590
Yeah.

568
00:39:06,048 --> 00:39:06,980
I saw Heather.

569
00:39:07,525 --> 00:39:08,731
She's pretty wasted.

570
00:39:13,597 --> 00:39:15,411
I've been a little over-served myself.

571
00:39:21,996 --> 00:39:23,232
I know what today is.

572
00:39:25,077 --> 00:39:28,960
My mom, she still has
the invitation on the fridge.

573
00:39:31,727 --> 00:39:35,761
You know, we never talked about him.
About Roger.

574
00:39:37,335 --> 00:39:38,380
What do you want to know?

575
00:39:42,545 --> 00:39:43,641
How did he propose?

576
00:39:48,045 --> 00:39:49,833
Cristal and caviar.

577
00:39:50,566 --> 00:39:53,680
Beats the hell out of malt liquor
in a video store parking lot.

578
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,753
We were teenagers.
What the hell did we know?

579
00:39:57,657 --> 00:39:59,171
Knew enough not to go through with it.

580
00:40:03,947 --> 00:40:06,593
Why did you come back, Jake?
Hmm?

581
00:40:07,117 --> 00:40:08,783
Why couldn't you have just stayed away?

582
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:11,762
Are you sure that's what you wanted?

583
00:40:12,617 --> 00:40:13,621
What did you just say?

584
00:40:31,445 --> 00:40:33,423
Are you sure that's what you wanted?
