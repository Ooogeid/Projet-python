2
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:03,542
Hello, Jonah.

3
00:00:03,642 --> 00:00:06,258
Guy did four years at Lansing
for extortion and assault.

4
00:00:06,383 --> 00:00:07,545
Why are you talking to him?

5
00:00:07,645 --> 00:00:10,125
It's okay, all right?
It didn't have anything to do with you.

6
00:00:10,235 --> 00:00:13,254
He's my father...
it has everything to do with me.

7
00:00:13,354 --> 00:00:16,864
Jonah agrees to leave town
and not come back.

8
00:00:16,964 --> 00:00:17,965
Exile.

9
00:00:18,065 --> 00:00:19,723
Johnston, you SOB.

10
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:21,456
How the hell did you lose an election?

11
00:00:21,556 --> 00:00:24,178
No, the question is how did you get
to be in charge of New Bern?

12
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:25,930
They get tired of you
being the sheriff?

13
00:00:26,047 --> 00:00:28,385
No, I m still sheriff.
Just got a little more authority.

14
00:00:28,485 --> 00:00:30,438
Does this thing work?
Can we get power from it?

15
00:00:30,507 --> 00:00:31,599
Probably sometime tomorrow.

16
00:00:31,685 --> 00:00:33,251
All right, let's get it up
as fast as we can.

17
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:34,534
Can we bust some more
of these things?

18
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:37,197
You got one of the only salt mines
around for 400 miles.

19
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:38,312
We're going to need food.

20
00:00:38,412 --> 00:00:40,325
Ten wind turbines for, let's say...

21
00:00:40,517 --> 00:00:41,812
ten percent of your spring crop.

22
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:43,679
Okay, look, we'll give you the food.

23
00:00:43,779 --> 00:00:46,341
We're going to need ten Jericho men
to help us build them.

24
00:00:46,786 --> 00:00:48,678
I didn't know you guys
were coming back today.

25
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:50,211
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.

26
00:00:50,264 --> 00:00:52,694
- Where's my brother?
- He hasn't been seen for a few days.

27
00:00:52,794 --> 00:00:55,777
You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china.

28
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:58,405
It's a full inventory of Jericho.

29
00:00:58,505 --> 00:01:00,228
They sliced it up like they own it.

30
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:01,824
They're making mortar rounds.

31
00:01:01,924 --> 00:01:03,325
They're getting ready for war.

32
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,443
Hold it!

33
00:01:04,543 --> 00:01:06,396
There was going to be
an explosion in town.

34
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,419
Hopefully, we can somehow
get Jake and Eric out of there.

35
00:01:17,348 --> 00:01:18,368
Everybody, go!

36
00:01:31,562 --> 00:01:33,241
All right, keep alert.
Jake said the New Bern guys

37
00:01:33,288 --> 00:01:34,862
might be coming right behind them.

38
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:39,002
Maybe they're already here.

39
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:44,290
What is that?

40
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:59,711
What happened?

41
00:02:00,274 --> 00:02:01,870
We got a major problem, Gray.

42
00:02:03,716 --> 00:02:04,717
Where's Eric?

43
00:02:04,842 --> 00:02:07,173
He's fine.
He's at the med center.

44
00:02:10,545 --> 00:02:12,063
Well, is it about the mine?

45
00:02:14,394 --> 00:02:15,896
It's a lot worse than that.

46
00:02:27,132 --> 00:02:28,142
Who are you?

47
00:02:31,508 --> 00:02:32,932
Stop moving.

48
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,311
You hear me?

49
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:38,063
I'm talking to you.

50
00:02:38,595 --> 00:02:39,596
Freeze!

51
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:56,653
Who are you?

52
00:03:00,502 --> 00:03:01,832
I think we killed...

53
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:04,107
six in New Bern.

54
00:03:06,907 --> 00:03:07,971
I counted eight.

55
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:20,026
Who's this?

56
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:22,096
Says he's from New Bern.

57
00:03:22,597 --> 00:03:23,817
Wanted to talk to you.

58
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:25,304
What is this about?

59
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:49,370
<i>Am I speaking to Gray Anderson?

60
00:03:53,272 --> 00:03:54,930
<i>This is Phil Constantino.

61
00:03:57,809 --> 00:04:00,078
<i>Henry, you can
come home now, son.

62
00:04:04,797 --> 00:04:06,768
<i>We're still cleaning the blood
of eight deputies

63
00:04:06,868 --> 00:04:08,476
<i>off the sidewalks of New Bern,

64
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:11,668
<i>so you need to understand
our position.

65
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,458
<i>We need seven farms,

66
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,555
<i>including the Jackson farm,

67
00:04:17,664 --> 00:04:18,791
<i>the Herbert farm,

68
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,480
<i>and the Richmond farm.

69
00:04:21,982 --> 00:04:23,911
And we need half the salt mine.

70
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:26,274
You have four hours to respond.

71
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,075
I don't understand.
What are you asking us to do?

72
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:33,176
Jericho is about to be invaded.

73
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:35,226
For the sake of your people,

74
00:04:35,523 --> 00:04:36,915
I'm asking you...

75
00:04:37,197 --> 00:04:38,276
to surrender.

80
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:59,018
We have border patrol on duty
at all the checkpoints

81
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,194
and all the new roadblocks,

82
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:01,965
but we're scrambling
to cover everywhere else.

83
00:05:01,996 --> 00:05:03,998
- Did you see anything out there?
- No, nothing.

84
00:05:04,108 --> 00:05:05,860
What is he actually going to do?

85
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:07,742
Just march in here and
start shooting us?

86
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:10,547
We were high school football rivals
five months ago.

87
00:05:10,548 --> 00:05:13,598
They tortured my brother to find out
how many troops we have, what weapons.

88
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:15,601
They have made hundreds of mortars.

89
00:05:15,702 --> 00:05:17,908
My guess says they can hit
from as far as...

90
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:19,191
two miles out.

91
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:22,848
Having them and using them on people
are two different things.

92
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:25,577
That's what they said
about nuclear bombs.

93
00:05:30,926 --> 00:05:32,208
How much time left?

94
00:05:32,396 --> 00:05:33,507
50 minutes.

95
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,611
<i>Haven't been able to get a pulse
from this baby for an hour.

96
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,629
<i>Respiration is 16, pulse is 84.

97
00:06:02,801 --> 00:06:05,225
<i>Fetal heart rate is less than
five beats per minute.

98
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,541
Just hold the pressure.
Put pressure right there,

99
00:06:07,651 --> 00:06:09,059
right there.
Press.

100
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,420
Harder. Damn it!

101
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,407
- I can't hear anything.
- What is going on?

102
00:06:12,517 --> 00:06:14,362
- I am trying to save April.
-<i> The baby's heart has stopped.

103
00:06:14,472 --> 00:06:16,490
- What do you mean it's stopped?
- Do something.

104
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:19,037
Oh, Mom.

105
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:24,169
Oh, God.

106
00:06:30,898 --> 00:06:31,899
Come on.

107
00:06:33,432 --> 00:06:35,466
Come on.
Let's get you fixed up, okay?

108
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:37,328
Come on, sweetheart.

109
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:41,548
We're not going to give anything
to these people.

110
00:06:43,535 --> 00:06:44,536
Mrs. Herbert?

111
00:06:44,676 --> 00:06:47,305
I just wanted to offer the town
a solution.

112
00:06:47,414 --> 00:06:49,135
You cannot give away that farm.

113
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:52,789
Gray said it's too far out of town
for the rangers to help.

114
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:54,889
I can't stand out there with a rifle.

115
00:06:56,995 --> 00:06:58,826
- Then I'll defend it.
- Really?

116
00:06:59,311 --> 00:07:00,797
Are you abandoning it?

117
00:07:03,754 --> 00:07:06,633
The bank owns half of that farm anyway.
You just...

118
00:07:07,454 --> 00:07:09,253
do whatever you want, Dale.

119
00:07:10,114 --> 00:07:11,428
Wait, let's be clear.

120
00:07:11,694 --> 00:07:13,978
If I defend it, then it's all mine.

121
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:16,208
If you can defend it.

122
00:07:20,032 --> 00:07:22,473
Dale, how are we going
to defend that farm?

123
00:07:29,652 --> 00:07:31,764
Get me every refugee you can find.

124
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,078
All right.

125
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,902
Careful.

126
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,054
I was so scared.

127
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,280
When you didn't come back, I thought...

128
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,383
I'm back.

129
00:08:11,685 --> 00:08:12,686
Oh, God!

130
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:16,973
I'm sorry.
I don't want to hurt you.

131
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,626
I'm okay.

132
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:29,042
Listen up! Guys!

133
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,530
They said you had some food here.

134
00:08:32,497 --> 00:08:34,045
Yeah... I do have food.

135
00:08:34,155 --> 00:08:37,221
As of this morning, I own
the second biggest farm in Jericho.

136
00:08:37,362 --> 00:08:38,364
Now...

137
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:40,443
I'm going to need men to defend it
if we're invaded.

138
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,485
What do we get?

139
00:08:41,594 --> 00:08:43,032
The promise of three meals a day.

140
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:45,648
You want us to risk our lives
for a promise?

141
00:08:46,415 --> 00:08:47,573
No way.

142
00:08:49,826 --> 00:08:51,828
Guys, listen, listen!

143
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:55,442
Since you've been here, you've been
asking for a place to live, food.

144
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:57,916
You came here as refugees,
and you're still being treated

145
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,647
like second-class citizens.

146
00:09:00,226 --> 00:09:01,446
That's no way to live.

147
00:09:04,094 --> 00:09:05,797
If you fight for my farm and we win,

148
00:09:05,897 --> 00:09:07,442
then everybody gets an equal split

149
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,461
It'll be your farm.

150
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:10,973
You'll have a stake in this town

151
00:09:11,073 --> 00:09:12,762
that nobody can take away from you.

152
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:18,196
You'll never have to ask anyone
for anything ever again.

153
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:21,484
So...

154
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:23,706
who wants a future?

155
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:37,860
Constantin said four hours.

156
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:43,389
It's already been four hours.

157
00:10:06,394 --> 00:10:07,427
You okay?

158
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,010
Come here.

159
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,199
What do we hear from the rangers?

160
00:10:17,324 --> 00:10:19,155
Runners came in.
They haven't seen anything.

161
00:10:19,296 --> 00:10:20,798
Should we call Constantino?

162
00:10:22,318 --> 00:10:24,211
I don't have anything to tell him.

163
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:28,560
And I'm not just going
to give the town away.

164
00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:32,902
There's something I need to tell you.

165
00:10:32,988 --> 00:10:35,694
It's crazy. Everybody's saying
that New Bern's going to attack us.

166
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:37,001
We don't know. Look...

167
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,713
Something happened to Heather.

168
00:10:41,368 --> 00:10:43,182
She found out New Bern
was building mortars.

169
00:10:43,282 --> 00:10:44,969
She tried to stop them and they...

170
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:47,769
they caught her.
Nobody's seen her since.

171
00:10:49,252 --> 00:10:51,645
- What did they do to her?
- I don't know.

172
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:56,855
Is she dead?

173
00:10:58,969 --> 00:11:00,471
Jake, is she dead?

174
00:11:07,887 --> 00:11:09,045
Get away from the windows!

175
00:11:14,953 --> 00:11:16,002
Are you hurt?

176
00:11:16,205 --> 00:11:18,114
- Are you hurt?
- I'm good. I'm good.

177
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:20,273
Wait here.

178
00:11:36,343 --> 00:11:37,344
Are you okay?

179
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:39,237
Somebody help!

180
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:41,523
Mom.

181
00:11:43,447 --> 00:11:44,449
Mom!

182
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:51,087
Cover your eyes!

183
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:09,752
Jake, you okay?

184
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:11,218
Honey?

185
00:12:11,716 --> 00:12:13,068
- Mom.
- Sweetheart, look at me.

186
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:14,648
- Look at me.
- I can't hear.

187
00:12:14,805 --> 00:12:16,328
I know, sweetie.
That'll come back.

188
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:18,239
- We're right here, Mom.
- What's happening?

189
00:12:18,348 --> 00:12:20,714
It's all right, sweetie.
Everything's going to be fine.

190
00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:24,485
Let's get you to the med center,
honey.

191
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:25,649
Come on.

192
00:12:26,932 --> 00:12:28,103
Get everybody off the street.

193
00:12:28,203 --> 00:12:29,641
There might be more coming.

194
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:32,402
We got to open the shelters
and the town hall

195
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,466
and the medical center...
Move!

196
00:12:35,762 --> 00:12:36,768
Constantino.

197
00:12:37,413 --> 00:12:38,907
He's on the radio.

198
00:12:41,582 --> 00:12:43,096
Constantino, you son of a bitch,

199
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:44,351
what the hell are you doing?

200
00:12:44,601 --> 00:12:46,150
<i>I'm sorry for your troubles.

201
00:12:46,656 --> 00:12:49,457
We got a dozen injured people
on the street here.

202
00:12:49,598 --> 00:12:52,487
<i>I warned you what would happen
if you didn't meet our demands.

203
00:12:52,587 --> 00:12:53,599
Demands?

204
00:12:55,038 --> 00:12:57,354
I will make it my,
my purpose in life

205
00:12:57,456 --> 00:13:00,037
to see that you are held accountable
for what you've just done.

206
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,504
<i>Take another hour...

207
00:13:01,604 --> 00:13:03,745
Do not fire any more
of those things in here!

208
00:13:04,137 --> 00:13:05,435
<i>One hour, Gray.

209
00:13:05,561 --> 00:13:07,219
<i>We need seven farms.

210
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:08,914
<i>It was just two mortars this time.

211
00:13:09,014 --> 00:13:10,653
<i>Next time there'll be three.

212
00:13:10,921 --> 00:13:13,518
Try to retaliate,
or refuse our demands,

213
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:14,809
we'll send more.

214
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,595
We'll do this day and night
for as long as it takes.

215
00:13:24,344 --> 00:13:27,254
The patrols said that it looked like
they were fired from the west.

216
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:30,020
Get as many rangers as you can,
all right, go out there,

217
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,980
find those mortars.
And we are gonna take them out!

218
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:35,257
Move!

219
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:49,430
Come on.

220
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,743
- Darcy, are you okay ?
- Yeah, but what happened ?

221
00:13:52,843 --> 00:13:54,433
It's New Bern.
They're firing mortars at us.

222
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,783
- Are you okay?
- Yeah!

223
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:59,492
Look, we've got to get the kids
and you got to get out of here.

224
00:13:59,696 --> 00:14:01,570
Where are we going to go?

225
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,343
There's a safe house I know of.
If we could just get there.

226
00:14:04,874 --> 00:14:06,283
It's in Montana.

227
00:14:06,587 --> 00:14:08,355
Go to Montana on these roads?

228
00:14:09,012 --> 00:14:10,780
What are our chances
of getting there?

229
00:14:10,925 --> 00:14:12,849
I don't know.

230
00:14:17,684 --> 00:14:19,972
- You heard from Constantino?
- No, no, but I...

231
00:14:20,113 --> 00:14:22,647
sent out a squad of rangers
to try to take out the mortars.

232
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:24,334
I should have been with them.

233
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:26,402
You weren't here,
and I couldn't wait.

234
00:14:29,742 --> 00:14:31,244
What should we do?

235
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,059
I don't know.

236
00:14:39,098 --> 00:14:41,242
We've got to get underground, now.

237
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:43,260
Everybody!

238
00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:45,145
You have got to get underground.

239
00:14:45,246 --> 00:14:47,671
You, get everybody underground.

240
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:50,237
Let's go home.

241
00:14:51,502 --> 00:14:52,676
Let's go home.

242
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:54,522
Okay.

243
00:15:06,347 --> 00:15:08,115
I have to get back to town.

244
00:15:09,671 --> 00:15:11,205
Sam, get away fromhere.

245
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:16,501
Dad, there's more water in the garage.
You want me to get it?

246
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:18,894
That is the safest room
in the house.

247
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:21,382
It's concrete, rebar, reinforced.

248
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:24,359
That's where we should be, D.

249
00:15:25,469 --> 00:15:26,502
Come on.

250
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,162
Come on in.

251
00:15:36,183 --> 00:15:37,810
This is cool!

252
00:15:52,763 --> 00:15:54,687
Sam, Allison, go in the other room.

253
00:15:55,469 --> 00:15:57,691
- Why can't...
- Come on, Sam. Let's go.

254
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,999
But this room's boring.

255
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:04,872
No more secrets.

256
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,747
Those mortars didn't come
from very far off.

257
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:13,939
- How much time do we have?
- About four minutes left.

258
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:17,129
<i>This is Stanley Richmond.
Mayor Anderson, can you hear me?

259
00:16:17,254 --> 00:16:18,549
- We hear you.
- <i>Okay,

260
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:20,931
<i>we're about 100 yards away
from the mortar cannons.

261
00:16:21,032 --> 00:16:23,504
<i>There's two of them,
sitting on the back of a flatbed truck.

262
00:16:23,802 --> 00:16:25,069
Where are you, Stanley?

263
00:16:25,882 --> 00:16:28,135
<i>We're in the woods
by the old </i>Shaw Creek Bridge,

264
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,802
<i>about two miles west of town.

265
00:16:29,911 --> 00:16:31,918
<i>There's out ten men
guarding the truck.

266
00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:34,761
- <i>They're arked in a clearing.</i>
- Can you get to them?

267
00:16:35,043 --> 00:16:37,687
<i>Yeah, I think so. There's a path
leading into the clearing.

268
00:16:37,787 --> 00:16:39,944
Tell him he's got to send scouts out
on both flanks.

269
00:16:40,044 --> 00:16:41,102
There's no time to reposition.

270
00:16:41,202 --> 00:16:42,927
They have to know
what they're going into.

271
00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:45,172
I'm not gonna give them
another chance to drop bombs on us.

272
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:46,504
Gray, these men are not soldiers...

273
00:16:46,604 --> 00:16:50,825
Johnston, you can stay or you can go,
but how this happens is my call.

274
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,258
- Stanley, get out of there. Don't do!
- Let go!

275
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,085
<i>What should we do?

276
00:17:07,606 --> 00:17:09,233
Take 'em out.

277
00:17:11,443 --> 00:17:12,695
<i>Got it.

278
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:26,878
So why now?

279
00:17:29,045 --> 00:17:32,049
You know I always thought
that I could keep you safe.

280
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,036
But now, uh, today...

281
00:17:35,608 --> 00:17:37,016
I'm just not so sure.

282
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,014
Nothing is safe.

283
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:42,891
Not anymore.

284
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:44,550
But, you know, in...

285
00:17:46,928 --> 00:17:48,649
in the middle of all of this...

286
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,540
in this madness...

287
00:17:51,978 --> 00:17:55,138
the only thing that make sense to me,
I mean really, the...

288
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:56,609
only thing...

289
00:17:58,189 --> 00:17:59,519
is you and the kids.

290
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:05,203
It took me a while to realize
that and I'm...

291
00:18:05,735 --> 00:18:06,986
sorry.
I am...

292
00:18:08,097 --> 00:18:09,102
so sorry.

293
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:20,396
I missed you.

294
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,559
I missed you.

295
00:18:58,744 --> 00:19:00,293
How do we know if it worked?

296
00:19:08,437 --> 00:19:09,439
Come on.

297
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:50,444
Is he shot?

298
00:19:55,144 --> 00:19:56,705
Sit down. Sit down.

299
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,971
Get him to the med center.

300
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:02,778
Is he all right?

301
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,003
Are you shot?

302
00:20:04,156 --> 00:20:05,176
Where's everybody else?

303
00:20:05,317 --> 00:20:06,948
Stanley, what happened out there?

304
00:20:07,135 --> 00:20:08,296
I don't know.

305
00:20:08,472 --> 00:20:10,489
We were moving
towards the mortar truck

306
00:20:11,105 --> 00:20:12,254
and they were waiting,

307
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,074
they were waiting
on both sides of it for us.

308
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,736
They wouldn't...
they wouldn't stop firing.

309
00:20:20,912 --> 00:20:22,683
Stanley, where's everybody else?

310
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,243
Where are they, son?

311
00:20:27,656 --> 00:20:28,677
They're...

312
00:20:28,826 --> 00:20:30,092
they're all dead.

313
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:35,699
They're all dead.

314
00:20:41,426 --> 00:20:42,704
This is insane.

315
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:47,748
This is insane!

316
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:48,933
You son of a bitch!

317
00:20:49,344 --> 00:20:50,399
Back off. Hold on.

318
00:20:50,622 --> 00:20:52,147
Hold on.

319
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,819
Bailey's... now.

320
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,243
Stanley said the mortars were
on trucks here,

321
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:10,648
right here, just east
of Shaw Creek Bridge.

322
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,199
They're going to fire and move.

323
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:14,592
Check the tracks, see which
direction they were headed.

324
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:16,023
And Jake, just scout them.

325
00:21:16,152 --> 00:21:18,286
We're not not going to do
anything else half-cocked.

326
00:21:18,498 --> 00:21:21,242
First, we find 'em, then
we'll formulate a plan of attack.

327
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:22,451
Got it.

328
00:21:22,644 --> 00:21:23,876
Just scout 'em.

329
00:21:25,072 --> 00:21:26,474
I'm coming with you.

330
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,465
It was not a request.

331
00:21:36,275 --> 00:21:37,295
All right.

332
00:21:40,896 --> 00:21:43,113
From the tracks, I'd say three,

333
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,693
maybe four trucks
headed down that fire road.

334
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:49,224
They could hit the town from anywhere
once they get to Route 6.

335
00:21:54,827 --> 00:21:57,373
Hawkins spotted a five-ton truck
coming this way from New Bern

336
00:21:57,596 --> 00:21:58,651
about three miles back

337
00:21:58,816 --> 00:22:01,950
Could be a supply truck
heading to the next mortar site.

338
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,125
We can get it.

339
00:22:06,818 --> 00:22:08,518
All right. Let's go.

340
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,065
Stop the truck now!
Stop it!

341
00:23:35,636 --> 00:23:36,657
They're all right.

342
00:23:36,981 --> 00:23:38,119
Let 'em go.

343
00:23:43,404 --> 00:23:45,816
You two finally turned to
a life of crime.

344
00:23:53,989 --> 00:23:55,523
We're going to need
your men, Dale.

345
00:23:55,711 --> 00:23:57,499
My men don't fight for
Gray Anderson.

346
00:23:57,746 --> 00:24:00,010
We're asking you
to help defend the town.

347
00:24:00,784 --> 00:24:02,743
We lose, you don't have anything.

348
00:24:04,842 --> 00:24:07,605
If we fight with you,
we keep Mrs. Herbert's farm.

349
00:24:08,226 --> 00:24:10,648
And we get the abandoned
Surrey farm also.

350
00:24:11,828 --> 00:24:13,306
You already own half a salt mine,

351
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:16,145
and a percentage of every farm
in the county. Now you want more?

352
00:24:16,345 --> 00:24:19,089
- It's just business.
- This isn't about business.

353
00:24:20,685 --> 00:24:22,632
I'm asking you to do this for me.

354
00:24:37,131 --> 00:24:38,421
We need your help.

355
00:24:38,714 --> 00:24:41,201
Let's get ready to move.
They'll be looking for this truck.

356
00:24:41,394 --> 00:24:43,928
Last time I was in town,
those people were trying to lynch me.

357
00:24:44,086 --> 00:24:45,283
They can all go to hell.

358
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,866
Just listen to me.

359
00:24:47,226 --> 00:24:48,974
No, you listen to me.

360
00:24:49,138 --> 00:24:50,862
I've been watching New Bern
moving weapons

361
00:24:51,026 --> 00:24:53,068
and supplies around here
for the last three days.

362
00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:54,634
This is going to be a bloodbath.

363
00:24:54,821 --> 00:24:56,827
The best thing you can do
is come with me.

364
00:24:57,613 --> 00:24:58,944
Jericho's my home.

365
00:24:59,508 --> 00:25:00,962
And I'm your father.

366
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,335
It's survival of the fastest
and strongest out here.

367
00:25:04,627 --> 00:25:06,627
You think I'm safer with you,
robbing trucks?

368
00:25:06,803 --> 00:25:07,906
I haven't lost a man yet.

369
00:25:08,111 --> 00:25:11,166
And if New Bern doesn't get Jericho,
somebody else will.

370
00:25:13,418 --> 00:25:14,474
Come with me.

371
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:21,426
Give us the maps,

372
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:24,158
help us take out the mortars,
help us fight.

373
00:25:25,214 --> 00:25:26,246
We'll give you half.

374
00:25:26,404 --> 00:25:28,539
Half of all weapons,
food and fuel that we take.

375
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,336
And if New Bern's army's as
big as you say it is,

376
00:25:31,506 --> 00:25:32,785
you'll do whole lot better than

377
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:35,230
hitting one truck at a time out here.

378
00:25:39,949 --> 00:25:43,034
You got more of me in you
than you're ever going to admit.

379
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:48,963
Change of plans!

380
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,998
When the federal government
comes back, we have our deeds.

381
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,594
We get our farms back then.

382
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:56,653
What if the government
doesn't come back?

383
00:25:56,923 --> 00:25:58,623
What if this is the way it stays?

384
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,169
But they are coming here
intent on killing us.

385
00:26:01,386 --> 00:26:03,550
Gray says we're only
three farms away from a deal.

386
00:26:03,632 --> 00:26:05,333
And besides,
we're not prepared to fight.

387
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,843
I will get us prepared.
You talk to those farmers,

388
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:09,262
you don't let them give in.

389
00:26:09,478 --> 00:26:11,601
Who else you got willing
to fight, Johnston?

390
00:26:11,753 --> 00:26:13,665
The cops?
The rangers?

391
00:26:14,495 --> 00:26:15,515
Dad?

392
00:26:28,752 --> 00:26:31,450
There are 11 potential mortar sites.

393
00:26:32,042 --> 00:26:34,107
Question is, which one is next?

394
00:26:34,546 --> 00:26:36,859
Driver said... this one.

395
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:38,495
If we can trust him.

396
00:26:39,076 --> 00:26:40,260
How were the trucks guarded?

397
00:26:40,577 --> 00:26:43,591
- They have men hidden in the brush.
- I'm not sure I'm taking your deal.

398
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,403
They have nearly 30 guys guarding
that mortar truck.

399
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:47,964
I see nine here.

400
00:26:50,691 --> 00:26:52,785
Gray's got the seven farmers he needs.

401
00:26:53,061 --> 00:26:55,090
He's going to call New Bern
and give them up.

402
00:26:55,251 --> 00:26:58,829
Surrenders those farms,
New Bern will occupy them in 30 minutes.

403
00:26:59,087 --> 00:27:00,471
We'll never get rid of them.

404
00:27:01,005 --> 00:27:02,424
So, what do we do?

405
00:27:03,949 --> 00:27:06,130
I guess I'm about to make
a deal with the devil.

406
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:09,573
You flatter me.

407
00:27:11,728 --> 00:27:13,745
get back over to town hall,
do whatever it takes,

408
00:27:13,903 --> 00:27:15,492
but don't let Gray make that call.

409
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,685
What do you mean, do whatever
it takes? What are you saying?

410
00:27:17,861 --> 00:27:19,949
I'm saying it's time to pick a side.

411
00:27:35,413 --> 00:27:36,581
Why'd you bring Grey in here?

412
00:27:36,646 --> 00:27:39,091
They just want to talk
to you for a second.

413
00:27:40,804 --> 00:27:42,421
Don't make that deal
with Constantino.

414
00:27:42,658 --> 00:27:43,749
It's not a debate.

415
00:27:43,924 --> 00:27:47,004
If you make this deal, they're not
going to stop with seven farms.

416
00:27:47,372 --> 00:27:49,097
People are going to starve
to death, Gray.

417
00:27:49,308 --> 00:27:52,076
And that's if they don't kill us
outright when the food gets scarce.

418
00:27:52,311 --> 00:27:53,390
I need you to leave.

419
00:27:53,551 --> 00:27:55,158
- Now!
- Come on, Gray.

420
00:27:55,944 --> 00:27:57,668
Why are you so ready to give up?

421
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,556
I almost gave my life
for this town, Gray.

422
00:27:59,662 --> 00:28:01,280
You better listen to me,
you understand?

423
00:28:01,444 --> 00:28:04,119
- It wasn't your fault those men died.
- Get 'em out of here!

424
00:28:04,297 --> 00:28:05,388
Get them out of here!

425
00:28:05,494 --> 00:28:07,347
You're going to listen
to what I have to say.

426
00:28:07,476 --> 00:28:08,508
It's not your fault.

427
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,849
Calm down!

428
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:14,104
Put 'em down!

429
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,016
Put 'em down!

430
00:28:28,192 --> 00:28:29,554
We have men out there, Gray.

431
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,762
What?

432
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:31,890
We have men out there.

433
00:28:31,952 --> 00:28:32,984
Put 'em down!

434
00:28:33,016 --> 00:28:34,582
- Brooks, put 'em down!
- You, too. Put 'em down..

435
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:35,708
Who is out there ?

436
00:28:35,804 --> 00:28:37,573
Who is out there and
what are they doing?

437
00:28:37,732 --> 00:28:39,245
Jake, Hawkins, my dad.

438
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:41,414
And they're going to try
and take out the mortars.

439
00:28:42,585 --> 00:28:44,548
The three of them?
What do they think they're going to do?

440
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,365
You cannot give up those farms.

441
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,099
- Do you understand?
- We can't fight!

442
00:28:48,743 --> 00:28:49,885
We can't fight.

443
00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:52,386
You saw what happened this morning.

444
00:28:53,113 --> 00:28:54,812
We're not ready for this.

445
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,497
I have been talking to Constantino,

446
00:28:59,381 --> 00:29:01,866
and I promised him that
we will not retaliate

447
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,310
if he just gives us time
to put this deal together.

448
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:06,466
We've got maps of all
of New Bern's positions.

449
00:29:06,572 --> 00:29:08,541
- Supply line, everything.
- Where did you get this stuff?

450
00:29:08,728 --> 00:29:10,849
We've got trucks. We've got fuel.
We've got guns.

451
00:29:11,118 --> 00:29:13,363
What are you talking about?
Where did you get all this?

452
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:15,467
Jonah Prowse is fighting with us.

453
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,100
He's got about 30 men
fighting with him. 30 men!

454
00:29:19,727 --> 00:29:21,473
Well, they can get us all killed.

455
00:29:22,699 --> 00:29:24,715
<i>This is New Bern. Over.

456
00:29:26,718 --> 00:29:28,159
Don't go near that radio, Gray.

457
00:29:28,581 --> 00:29:30,667
<i>Mayor Anderson, are you there?

458
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,339
Johnston Green, right?

459
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:48,858
Two years ago,  you came over
to New Bern and finished fourth

460
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:51,713
in a bass fishing contest
up at Big Hill Lake.

461
00:29:53,975 --> 00:29:55,487
I finished second.

462
00:30:08,884 --> 00:30:10,220
Let's go.

463
00:30:14,341 --> 00:30:16,813
<i>Mayor Anderson,
your time is running out.

464
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:19,743
She tried to tell Constantino
that I did not send them out there.

465
00:30:19,977 --> 00:30:22,122
Gray, don't make that deal.

466
00:30:22,363 --> 00:30:24,438
Buy some time to take out those mortars.

467
00:30:25,938 --> 00:30:27,473
Negotiate with Constantino.

468
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,384
So, we pop out of here,

469
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:41,169
it gets bad, Jonah going
will have our backs, right?

470
00:30:42,739 --> 00:30:44,825
You are filling me
with confidence, Jake.

471
00:30:45,622 --> 00:30:47,554
Emily's with him.
He'll be there.

472
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:52,402
<i>Mayor Anderson, are you there?

473
00:30:53,996 --> 00:30:55,437
Yeah, I'm here, Phil.

474
00:30:55,993 --> 00:30:57,434
<i>What's your decision?

475
00:30:58,067 --> 00:30:59,602
You're a good businessman, Gray.

476
00:31:00,744 --> 00:31:02,249
You know how to do it.

477
00:31:05,144 --> 00:31:06,943
Well, we don't want to fight.

478
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,310
So,

479
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:12,621
what about the... Levine

480
00:31:13,336 --> 00:31:18,305
and Hides Dairy farms,
in-instead of the Richmond farm?

481
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,973
<i>That's less acreage.

482
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,004
Yeah, I know, but...

483
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:33,959
then you would have a dairy
and a soybean farm,

484
00:31:34,252 --> 00:31:36,818
and also Hides has 50 acres of corn,

485
00:31:37,072 --> 00:31:41,262
and I got to tell you, that deal would
be a lot easier to sell to my people.

486
00:32:17,632 --> 00:32:18,687
Where you been?

487
00:32:18,863 --> 00:32:20,363
Supposed to be here three hours ago.

488
00:32:20,515 --> 00:32:22,331
I got sniped at by
a gang over near Calvert.

489
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:26,310
Had to come all the way back around
through... back through Van Ness.

490
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,286
Got a half a barbecued venison in back.

491
00:32:30,509 --> 00:32:31,517
You're kidding?

492
00:32:31,927 --> 00:32:33,099
God, we need it.

493
00:32:35,888 --> 00:32:37,025
We got chow!

494
00:32:50,734 --> 00:32:51,918
We'll eat in shifts.

495
00:32:52,158 --> 00:32:54,449
Don't pull everybody off
the perimeter at the same time.

496
00:32:57,749 --> 00:32:58,886
Don't move.

497
00:32:59,952 --> 00:33:01,435
And drop your weapons.

498
00:33:03,157 --> 00:33:04,557
Get in the truck.
Move!

499
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:09,803
<i>My people are telling me
that all the cattle out

500
00:33:10,014 --> 00:33:12,065
<i>at Hides farm have been
slaughtered for food.

501
00:33:12,234 --> 00:33:15,000
Really?
I don't think so, but

502
00:33:15,187 --> 00:33:16,816
I can find out for you.

503
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,212
Let's talk about the salt mine now.

504
00:33:19,534 --> 00:33:23,377
You've already got 25% of the mine.
Can't we just leave it at that?

505
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,661
<i>What are you doing, Gray?

506
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,700
What are you talking about?

507
00:33:29,911 --> 00:33:31,528
<i>This negotiation is over.

508
00:33:32,618 --> 00:33:34,247
No, Phil, come on.

509
00:33:35,084 --> 00:33:37,827
<i>30 seconds, Gray,
or I send more mortars.

510
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,032
We almost have a deal here, Phil.
Come on!

511
00:33:58,304 --> 00:33:59,359
They're here!

512
00:33:59,582 --> 00:34:00,789
They're in the camp!

513
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,390
I'm closing the camp!

514
00:34:03,613 --> 00:34:05,101
Come on. Get up there!

515
00:34:47,366 --> 00:34:48,960
Where the hell is Jonah?

516
00:34:50,483 --> 00:34:52,405
He doesn't want to get hit
in our crossfire.

517
00:34:52,986 --> 00:34:54,017
Cease fire!

518
00:34:54,896 --> 00:34:55,904
Cease fire!

519
00:34:56,092 --> 00:34:57,146
Stop!

520
00:36:56,156 --> 00:36:58,161
This one's yours.
Meet you back at the camp.

521
00:36:58,539 --> 00:37:00,596
Wait.
What are you talking about?

522
00:37:00,904 --> 00:37:01,923
Deal's changed.

523
00:37:02,154 --> 00:37:03,462
The hell it has.

524
00:37:04,902 --> 00:37:05,922
It's a new split:

525
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:09,490
I get all the weapons, the food,
the fuel, the guns, everything.

526
00:37:09,748 --> 00:37:11,402
- Deal's 50-50.
- And what do we get?

527
00:37:11,554 --> 00:37:13,478
You get to have bombs
not falling on your head.

528
00:37:13,654 --> 00:37:14,674
Listen here, Jonah...

529
00:37:15,296 --> 00:37:16,962
This is about to get a lot worse.

530
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,733
We need those guns!

531
00:37:19,131 --> 00:37:20,551
Why are you doing this?

532
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,756
You owe me a lot more than that!

533
00:37:22,987 --> 00:37:24,922
I am a thief, not a soldier.

534
00:37:25,755 --> 00:37:27,503
You promised you'd help us.

535
00:37:27,749 --> 00:37:29,603
Look, you shouldn't be near me.

536
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:32,682
You're a schoolteacher, kid.
A schoolteacher.

537
00:37:35,766 --> 00:37:36,827
Go on.

538
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:57,967
We're just gonna let him go?
We need those guns.

539
00:37:58,237 --> 00:37:59,246
Guns.

540
00:38:02,336 --> 00:38:03,520
Guns are easy.

541
00:38:37,111 --> 00:38:40,231
You had this the whole time
and you didn't say anything?

542
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:45,219
I never thought I was gonna call
this town my home.

543
00:38:48,054 --> 00:38:49,661
Let's get them loaded up.

544
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:57,485
What's he doing?

545
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,356
Why hasn't he fired the mortars?

546
00:39:01,543 --> 00:39:02,587
Did we take them out?

547
00:39:02,775 --> 00:39:04,957
He would have come back
on the radio.

548
00:39:14,631 --> 00:39:16,192
We took out the mortars.

549
00:39:19,743 --> 00:39:20,798
Hell, yeah.

550
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,288
<i>Are you there?

551
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:41,245
<i>Now, you've brought this on yourself.

552
00:39:41,597 --> 00:39:43,884
<i>There's no deals, no mercy.

553
00:39:44,646 --> 00:39:45,702
<i>We're coming.

554
00:39:46,341 --> 00:39:47,878
<i>This means war.

555
00:39:49,496 --> 00:39:51,185
<i>Do you hear me, Gray?

556
00:40:03,008 --> 00:40:04,286
I need your help.

557
00:40:19,279 --> 00:40:21,320
Stanley, get me every
runner you can find.

558
00:40:21,566 --> 00:40:24,147
I want to get orders out
to all the patrols.

559
00:41:17,873 --> 00:41:20,547
Most of you have no idea what to do

560
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,063
or what's coming.

561
00:41:26,118 --> 00:41:27,491
Some of you do.

562
00:41:32,543 --> 00:41:35,041
This isn't a fight about land

563
00:41:35,581 --> 00:41:37,610
or about this town.

564
00:41:39,827 --> 00:41:42,407
This is a fight for our very existence.

565
00:41:46,885 --> 00:41:48,398
Pray for each other.

566
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:54,619
While you're at it, pray for the men
and women of New Bern.

567
00:41:56,367 --> 00:41:58,173
Pray that God forgives us.

568
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:09,129
Every able-bodied person...

569
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,562
who needs a gun...

570
00:42:14,843 --> 00:42:17,212
16 years of age or older...

571
00:42:19,652 --> 00:42:20,685
line up.
