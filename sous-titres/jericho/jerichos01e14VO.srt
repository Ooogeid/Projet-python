00:00:00,212 --> 00:00:01,601
Previously on Jericho

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:03,164
<i>Bring them inside.</i>

3
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:04,649
<i>Some of them were on planes</i>

4
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,559
<i>that landed in
the middle of nowhere.</i>

5
00:00:06,772 --> 00:00:08,373
<i>They've been walking
for weeks.</i>

6
00:00:08,682 --> 00:00:10,389
<i>They must have gone
through hell.</i>

7
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,381
<i>Oh, my God... Roger.</i>

8
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:16,460
<i>You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.</i>

9
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:18,120
<i>You need to keep
them clean and warm.</i>

10
00:00:18,196 --> 00:00:19,740
<i>Do you know anyone
in Jericho?</i>

11
00:00:19,914 --> 00:00:22,152
<i>Actually... I do.</i>

12
00:00:23,822 --> 00:00:24,921
<i>Hello, Rob.</i>

13
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,449
<i>We're using the generator
to power the town hall</i>

14
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,793
<i>for three hours a day,
the Med Center for six.</i>

15
00:00:29,994 --> 00:00:33,352
<i>With 53 new people, at current
levels of consumption...</i>

16
00:00:33,773 --> 00:00:37,149
<i>we will be completely out
of gas and diesel in two weeks.</i>

17
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:39,868
<i>- Mrs. Green?
- What?</i>

18
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,884
<i>Eric told me that
April's pregnant.</i>

19
00:00:42,203 --> 00:00:43,572
<i>It's the Old Man.</i>

20
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,174
<i>He's coming for us
using us against each other.</i>

21
00:00:46,232 --> 00:00:49,377
<i>We go see him and if,
if he is behind this,</i>

22
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:50,592
<i>We take him out.</i>

23
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,483
<i>We leave first thing
in the morning.</i>

24
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:19,573
<i>Any luck out there?</i>

25
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,001
Sorry, ma'am.

26
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:26,364
Nothing?
Not even rabbits?

27
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:28,523
Never seen anything
like it before.

28
00:01:28,524 --> 00:01:29,952
Nothing moving out there.

29
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,379
Think it was the fallout? Maybe it was
the radiation that killed the deer.

30
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,269
There'd still be dead animals,
carcasses, something.

31
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,114
I mean, it was weird.

32
00:01:36,115 --> 00:01:37,373
Like all the game had vanished.

33
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,673
How far out
did you go?

34
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:42,378
15 miles out by Mill Pond
along the creek there.

35
00:01:42,498 --> 00:01:44,422
Guess we're going to have
to drive, huh, Jake?

36
00:01:44,423 --> 00:01:47,435
Yeah, but we have to be careful
about burning the gas rations

37
00:01:47,436 --> 00:01:48,438
in the middle of winter.

38
00:01:48,496 --> 00:01:50,424
We need everything we can
to run the generator.

39
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:51,987
We can live without
power for now.

40
00:01:52,528 --> 00:01:53,715
Make fires to stay warm.

41
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:56,136
But we won't see Spring
if we don't eat.

42
00:01:56,213 --> 00:01:59,117
Stanley and I will have to use
whatever gas we can spare.

43
00:01:59,357 --> 00:02:01,314
and go out west,
Go out as far as it takes.

44
00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:04,122
The rest of the hunting parties
will have to scrounge around locally.

45
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:06,142
Yeah, and Mimi's coming
with us.

46
00:02:07,068 --> 00:02:07,868
What?

47
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,113
Well, in case something happens to me,
I want to make sure she knows...

48
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,535
how to trap and shoot, okay?

49
00:02:16,676 --> 00:02:19,300
Look, the further you get
the hairier the roads are.

50
00:02:19,338 --> 00:02:20,824
With food being
as scarce as it is,

51
00:02:20,825 --> 00:02:22,598
there's bound to be
some trouble out there.

52
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,914
That sleeping bag's
rated to 40 below

53
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:28,077
and here's a wind-proof lighter for you.
You're going to need them both.

54
00:02:28,424 --> 00:02:29,509
Good hunting.

55
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:34,409
I'm guessing the good folks
of Jericho don't know

56
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,361
about all this stuff down here.
- They don't know about a lot of things.

57
00:02:37,517 --> 00:02:39,634
That'll be enough to get us
to the Old Man's place?

58
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:41,732
He is only about
two hours away.

59
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:43,734
I didn't realize
he was so close.

60
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,374
He chose the rally point.

61
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:47,534
Wanted it in his backyard.

62
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:49,116
How long as he been
watching you?

63
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,479
My guess...

64
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,006
since I stopped communications
a few days ago.

65
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:57,519
You worried about what we're
going to find out there?

66
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,719
- You're not.
- We can handle him.

67
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:03,037
It's you and me.
Let's get to work.

68
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:09,456
My grandmother
went fast than this

69
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:11,000
and she didn't
even have a car.

70
00:03:11,135 --> 00:03:13,219
We have to take it easy,
we only have half a tank.

71
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,974
Well, hopefully we'll make it
to Flint Springs. It's got...

72
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:16,402
Hopefully? What do you
mean "hopefully"?

73
00:03:16,403 --> 00:03:18,502
It's got a river.
It's prime white-tailed terrain.

74
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:19,659
I know, but...
This is crazy.

75
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,627
I told you that
I can't hunt.

76
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:22,862
Now you want me to kill Bambi.

77
00:03:22,863 --> 00:03:24,136
You're gonna have to
learn, all right?

78
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:26,142
Everyone's doing their part.
Bonnie's been out twice.

79
00:03:26,143 --> 00:03:27,425
Well, good for
frickin' Bonnie.

80
00:03:27,426 --> 00:03:28,775
Bonnie grew up on farm.

81
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:30,511
The closest I ever got
to the outdoors

82
00:03:30,512 --> 00:03:32,673
was the is the Ralph Lauren
section of Neiman Marcus.

83
00:03:32,706 --> 00:03:33,849
There you go,
bargain hunting.

84
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,064
Same thing, but with a gun.

85
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:37,080
Bargains? At Neimans?

86
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:38,456
Sometimes I forget

87
00:03:38,457 --> 00:03:40,636
that the biggest designer
in your closet is Wrangler.

88
00:03:42,314 --> 00:03:43,404
What are you
laughing at?

89
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,671
I've never seen you in a
domestic squabble before.

90
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:47,441
Knock it off.
This isn't squabbling.

91
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,901
Oh, my God.

92
00:03:56,197 --> 00:03:58,030
These dogs have tags.

93
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:04,644
Look at all this.

94
00:04:09,394 --> 00:04:10,628
Wall Drugs.

95
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:12,442
Wall, South Dakota.

96
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,962
Do you think that's where all
these people were coming from?

97
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:15,895
Think about it.

98
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,755
South Dakota without heat,
electricity, or...

99
00:04:19,314 --> 00:04:20,626
food being trucked in.

100
00:04:20,645 --> 00:04:22,575
It's got to be even worse
in North Dakota,

101
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:23,481
Montana.

102
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:28,438
Oh, my God.

103
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:43,605
I read about this
at Blackjack.

104
00:04:44,369 --> 00:04:48,150
Mass migration, hundreds...
maybe thousands of people

105
00:04:48,883 --> 00:04:50,041
heading south.

106
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:53,706
Trying to outrun winter.

107
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,694
Should we be doing
that, too?

112
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:24,159
How far is it?

113
00:05:26,204 --> 00:05:27,227
...60.

114
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:29,098
It's about 60 yards.

115
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:33,988
So 60 yard with almost
1.5 people per yard.

116
00:05:33,989 --> 00:05:35,125
That's 90.

117
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,113
That's almost 100 people
just across.

118
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,411
The way the ground
is trampled,

119
00:05:38,412 --> 00:05:40,340
you got to figure five
or tens times that amount

120
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:41,458
of people came through here.

121
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:44,585
Almost a thousand people?
Where are they going?

122
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:47,266
South Texas, Mexico.

123
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,765
Anyplace warmer.

124
00:05:49,035 --> 00:05:50,945
It'd take weeks
to get there by foot.

125
00:05:50,954 --> 00:05:53,143
God know how many thousand
people have the same idea.

126
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,784
Mexico's borders
could be closed.

127
00:05:54,785 --> 00:05:56,964
We don't even know if
there still is a Mexico.

128
00:05:58,162 --> 00:05:59,571
Maybe we should try
to catch on with them.

129
00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:03,449
We can barely feed ourselves,
let alone... hundreds more.

130
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,958
We got to keep going.

131
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:10,624
Let's go.

132
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,532
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

133
00:06:25,314 --> 00:06:26,520
Hey. Glad you came down.

134
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,131
Thank you.

135
00:06:28,746 --> 00:06:30,540
- What time did you, uh...
- Early...

136
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:31,968
late, I guess.

137
00:06:32,034 --> 00:06:34,089
I didn't want to wake you,
you looked so peaceful.

138
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,749
Peaceful? Really?

139
00:06:35,846 --> 00:06:38,537
Did you have another one of those
bad dreams? Keep on there.

140
00:06:38,718 --> 00:06:40,773
I guess neither one of
us got much sleep.

141
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:44,415
All I could do was think about
all these people down here, you know.

142
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,126
And then I remembered about the
clothes we had in the attic.

143
00:06:47,127 --> 00:06:48,780
I thought that sweater
looked familiar.

144
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,761
Yeah, that woman was on
layover in Kansas City

145
00:06:50,762 --> 00:06:51,764
when the bombs went off,

146
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,450
Her husband and two kids
were waiting for her at home.

147
00:06:54,484 --> 00:06:55,294
Where?

148
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,259
Denver.

149
00:06:58,111 --> 00:06:59,597
I lead these people here.

150
00:06:59,715 --> 00:07:01,644
For better or worse
this is their home now.

151
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,785
It's on me to make sure
they're taken care of.

152
00:07:04,596 --> 00:07:06,236
Yeah, of course.

153
00:07:07,123 --> 00:07:08,493
What can I do to help, huh?

154
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:12,211
Talk to them,
follow your instincts.

155
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:14,449
The truth is...

156
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:16,340
I'm winging this myself.

157
00:07:24,283 --> 00:07:25,421
I'll be outside.
Here.

158
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,157
Should be back
before dark.

159
00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:35,704
And if you're not?

160
00:07:38,873 --> 00:07:40,918
Just tell me when I
should start to worry.

161
00:07:41,246 --> 00:07:42,616
This is the last time,

162
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:43,696
okay?

163
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,992
After today

164
00:07:46,435 --> 00:07:47,612
I'm here...

165
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:50,930
for good, huh?

166
00:07:52,463 --> 00:07:53,312
Okay.

167
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:55,492
I'll hold you to that.

168
00:08:06,773 --> 00:08:07,583
Hi, honey.

169
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,425
How'd it go this morning?

170
00:08:09,647 --> 00:08:10,921
The whole thing
was a bust.

171
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,213
I'm sorry, hon.

172
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:13,303
Jake's out there now.

173
00:08:13,304 --> 00:08:14,461
Hopefully he and Stanley

174
00:08:14,462 --> 00:08:15,966
will have better luck
than I did.

175
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,046
Is April here?

176
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:18,097
No, she's at
the clinic.

177
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:20,045
She promised me
she'd take a nap.

178
00:08:20,248 --> 00:08:22,756
I hope it is warmer in that
clinic than it is in this house.

179
00:08:22,757 --> 00:08:24,762
I think this house has
dropped ten degrees

180
00:08:24,763 --> 00:08:25,842
in the last hour.

181
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,389
Feels like a storm's
coming in.

182
00:08:29,614 --> 00:08:32,546
We'd better seal up these
windows the best was we can.

183
00:08:32,682 --> 00:08:34,804
Been going around collecting
old sheets and linens.

184
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:37,081
We'll shove them
underneath the doors.

185
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,663
Look what I found...

186
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,689
hidden in Jake's closet.

187
00:08:42,869 --> 00:08:44,769
Lord knows how long
that's been there.

188
00:08:44,865 --> 00:08:46,968
Well, at least he was
drinking the good stuff.

189
00:08:47,007 --> 00:08:49,785
I used to hide the most awful
rotgut in the world

190
00:08:49,786 --> 00:08:51,444
behind my mother's
china cabinet.

191
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:57,671
What do you think?

192
00:08:59,157 --> 00:09:00,527
On an empty stomach?

193
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,533
I'll get the glasses.

194
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:07,556
Why would anyone destroy all this.

195
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:10,651
If they'd wanted it out of commission,
they could have just taken it.

196
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,626
Be worth a fortune after the E.M.P.

197
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:14,889
Maybe there wasn't time,

198
00:10:14,953 --> 00:10:17,536
or maybe they didn't
care about this stuff.

199
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,858
- How long?
- A couple of days...

200
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:28,010
Give or take.

201
00:10:28,507 --> 00:10:30,516
But we just heard
from him yesterday.

202
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:33,850
We heard from someone.

203
00:10:34,082 --> 00:10:35,284
Remote uplink.

204
00:10:35,654 --> 00:10:37,850
Somebody else using
his access codes.

205
00:10:37,873 --> 00:10:39,584
Who could have done this?

206
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,318
Wager for the first kill.

207
00:10:49,884 --> 00:10:51,467
I'm in for a dozen eggs.

208
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:54,305
Two hours chopping wood.

209
00:10:54,652 --> 00:10:56,294
Tax return consultation.

210
00:10:58,146 --> 00:11:00,429
Oh, how about
foot massages for a week?

211
00:11:00,822 --> 00:11:02,325
For me, not for him.

212
00:11:03,302 --> 00:11:04,320
We'll talk.

213
00:11:04,343 --> 00:11:05,574
Stanley, stop.

214
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:14,066
- What are they doing?
- They're blocking the whole road.

215
00:11:14,124 --> 00:11:15,881
More like staking it out.

216
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:18,603
All right, turn around.

217
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:19,968
And... and go where?

218
00:11:19,969 --> 00:11:23,823
I don't know. Just do it, all right?
Turn around. We'll find another road.

219
00:11:43,242 --> 00:11:45,011
I see it. Damn it.

220
00:11:49,477 --> 00:11:51,338
Why are they following us?

221
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,266
Stanley, gun it!

222
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,018
This should get us
back to the highway.

223
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:12,886
Then what?

224
00:12:12,887 --> 00:12:15,144
We try to make it back home,
find the patrol.

225
00:12:15,472 --> 00:12:17,352
Maybe they'll give up by then
or run out of gas.

226
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:19,034
Yeah, if we don't first.

227
00:12:19,474 --> 00:12:21,339
Stanley...
Stanley, hold on!

228
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,150
Doesn't look like
he put up much of a fight.

229
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:26,902
He was probably out
before he knew what hit him.

230
00:12:26,903 --> 00:12:29,153
He must have trusted whoever did it.

231
00:12:29,488 --> 00:12:32,748
The thing is, whoever it was,

232
00:12:33,557 --> 00:12:35,719
they knew what
they were doing there,

233
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,260
not over here.

234
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:39,757
I mean, look at this.
It's a mess.

235
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,528
But the drives...
They look like they're still intact.

236
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,769
The old man had information
on the entire team...

237
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,778
Contact information,
backgrounds...

238
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:49,294
Last known whereabouts.

239
00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:52,846
Let's find out where everybody is.

240
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,757
We can't outrun them.

241
00:12:56,758 --> 00:12:58,744
- How far till Jericho?
- Too far.

242
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:01,770
Oh, God!

243
00:13:10,816 --> 00:13:11,833
Stay down.

244
00:13:19,087 --> 00:13:20,231
Stay down.

245
00:13:39,222 --> 00:13:41,044
Give me that drive you got there.

246
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,720
Must feel good to be back
in the saddle, huh?

247
00:13:44,268 --> 00:13:46,868
I wish we didn't have
to come out here in the first place.

248
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:49,798
What, are you getting soft on me?
Too much domestic bliss?

249
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,395
Not quite bliss.

250
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:55,269
There.
There it is. We're in.

251
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,001
Thank you.

252
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,208
Karaoke bullfighter, right?

253
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:25,265
Excuse me?

254
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:26,780
At that bar in Barcelona.

255
00:14:26,803 --> 00:14:30,312
You decked a bullfighter who tried
to get you to stop singing that song...

256
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:31,849
"Stairway to Heaven"?

257
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:33,953
Did Roger tell you that?

258
00:14:34,554 --> 00:14:37,795
He also mentioned you like Oreo,
ice cream and white daisies.

259
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:40,696
Don't be mad at him.

260
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,285
He was trying to keep us entertained.

261
00:14:43,286 --> 00:14:44,707
He kept talking and,

262
00:14:44,777 --> 00:14:46,325
somehow, we kept moving.

263
00:14:58,719 --> 00:14:59,979
Hey. How you doing?

264
00:15:00,014 --> 00:15:01,347
I'm a little tired.

265
00:15:01,348 --> 00:15:03,834
I'm going to head home
and get cleaned up.

266
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,431
Think I'll stay here for a
little longer if you don't mind.

267
00:15:07,847 --> 00:15:09,170
Yeah. Of course.

268
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,393
You sure?

269
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,251
Yeah, I'm sure.

270
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,690
Looks like you owe
these folks a rematch.

271
00:15:15,407 --> 00:15:17,750
So, um...
I will see you when I see you.

272
00:15:34,223 --> 00:15:35,581
- To Jake.
- To Jake.

273
00:15:36,506 --> 00:15:39,396
Who would have thought,
six months ago, you'd be toasting him?

274
00:15:41,928 --> 00:15:44,838
Well, God knows Eric wouldn't
have hidden the bottle.

275
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:48,332
You and Jake have always
had much more in common

276
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,077
than you wanted to admit.

277
00:15:52,088 --> 00:15:53,377
You going hunting

278
00:15:54,568 --> 00:15:56,013
all those weekends...

279
00:15:58,304 --> 00:16:01,460
Why that kid got sit
in a deer stand for hours?

280
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:05,726
We wouldn't say a word
to each other. Just...

281
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,420
be in the woods together.

282
00:16:11,325 --> 00:16:15,187
I was always afraid that Jake
would forget about that.

283
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:18,528
You know, that he'd grow up only
remembering the bad times. That we were

284
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:23,697
That he wouldn't remember
that we had been close.

285
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:28,096
That we were... buddies once.

286
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:34,011
He remembers...

287
00:16:38,404 --> 00:16:39,664
deep down.

288
00:16:42,157 --> 00:16:44,874
That's why you mean
so much to him.

289
00:16:47,903 --> 00:16:49,741
Boy, that wind sounds awful.

290
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,065
I hope Stanley and Jake
are okay out there.

291
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:49,879
What happened?

292
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,154
Jake, Stanley's not moving.

293
00:17:52,183 --> 00:17:54,160
- What?
- Stanley's not moving.

294
00:18:02,488 --> 00:18:03,897
Oh, my God. Go hide.

295
00:18:05,598 --> 00:18:06,782
- Go hide.
- No

296
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:08,278
- Go on.
- No, No. Stanley...

297
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:10,154
You'll be fine.
Go! Go hide!

298
00:19:30,793 --> 00:19:32,740
Come on.
Help me with Stanley.

299
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:35,654
I can't move.

300
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:41,396
Ritts, Woodworth, Pierce.

301
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,373
That's half the team.

302
00:19:43,812 --> 00:19:46,090
We're being hunted.
It's worse than that.

303
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:48,674
It's Woodworth and his wife.

304
00:19:49,032 --> 00:19:51,197
They were in Richmond.
That's his daughter.

305
00:19:51,622 --> 00:19:53,783
Anyone close to us
is in danger, too.

306
00:19:54,118 --> 00:19:55,321
No loose ends.

307
00:19:56,065 --> 00:19:57,299
Don't worry about your family.

308
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:59,417
We're not going to let
anything happen to them.

309
00:19:59,418 --> 00:20:01,241
It's just us, Chavez
and Cheung left.

310
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:03,557
We'll get back out on the field,
stay in the weeds

311
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:05,254
until we can connect
with the chief.

312
00:20:05,602 --> 00:20:06,683
Here. Look at this.

313
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:12,591
What is that?

314
00:20:12,938 --> 00:20:14,810
If we are being hunted,

315
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:18,282
there... is the hunter.

316
00:20:25,545 --> 00:20:28,266
Stanley, are you okay?

317
00:20:29,423 --> 00:20:30,542
Can you get up?

318
00:20:39,411 --> 00:20:40,259
Your leg?

319
00:20:41,234 --> 00:20:42,613
I think I busted my ankle.

320
00:20:50,453 --> 00:20:51,600
I'm okay.

321
00:20:52,556 --> 00:20:53,636
I'm just stuck.

322
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:57,494
- Let me try to get this off.
- Stanley, don't.

323
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:00,273
We can't do this ourselves.
You might make it worse.

324
00:21:01,987 --> 00:21:03,666
Maybe you could dig me out.

325
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:05,479
All right.

326
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,547
Help me get the shovels. They're in
the bed of the truck.

327
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,322
It's gone.

328
00:21:10,341 --> 00:21:12,319
All right, get the jack.
The jack's back there.

329
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,587
They took everything.

330
00:21:23,192 --> 00:21:24,503
How was your bath?

331
00:21:27,127 --> 00:21:29,558
Lukewarm, then luke-cold,

332
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:30,974
then pretty much icy.

333
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,138
- Look. Remember this?
- Oh, yeah.

334
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:36,608
Times Square,
New Year's Eve, 2005.

335
00:21:37,071 --> 00:21:38,016
Wasted.

336
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,965
That hangover was epic.

337
00:21:43,821 --> 00:21:47,159
Do you remember the last thing I said to
you the night before you left Jericho ?

338
00:21:47,246 --> 00:21:49,407
That I was selfish
and I didn't listen?

339
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,429
Something like that?

340
00:21:51,432 --> 00:21:54,287
You have no idea how that ate
at me while you were gone.

341
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:57,529
- I just kept thinking that was
the last  - You were right.

342
00:22:00,951 --> 00:22:06,373
You know, today,
seeing you with those people...

343
00:22:07,665 --> 00:22:09,402
It was like you had found yourself.

344
00:22:11,273 --> 00:22:13,626
I'm still just trying to figure
it out, you know?

345
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,291
We're not these people anymore.

346
00:22:23,864 --> 00:22:26,053
But I'll tell you the one thing
that hasn't changed.

347
00:22:26,276 --> 00:22:27,742
The one constant.

348
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:29,266
I love you.

349
00:22:30,232 --> 00:22:31,853
And it's going
to take a whole lot more

350
00:22:31,854 --> 00:22:33,898
than the end of the world
to change that.

351
00:22:45,285 --> 00:22:47,697
- How are your legs?
- I don't know I can't feel anything.

352
00:22:48,565 --> 00:22:49,645
The ground's
frozen solid.

353
00:22:49,646 --> 00:22:50,917
It's sucking the heat
right out of you.

354
00:22:50,918 --> 00:22:52,211
Why can't we build a fire?

355
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,638
You smell the fumes?

356
00:22:53,812 --> 00:22:55,568
You have to get back to town.

357
00:22:55,703 --> 00:22:57,149
All right. I'm going
to try and go.

358
00:22:58,156 --> 00:22:59,854
No. You can't on that ankle.

359
00:23:00,226 --> 00:23:02,208
- I'll go.
- No. Those guys are still out there.

360
00:23:02,209 --> 00:23:03,462
They went the other way.

361
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:06,240
Jericho has a patrol
five miles out of town.

362
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:07,822
We can't have come
more than ten.

363
00:23:07,918 --> 00:23:09,385
Jake, it's too dangerous.

364
00:23:09,435 --> 00:23:10,477
What are our options?

365
00:23:10,496 --> 00:23:11,866
With no bags, no fire?

366
00:23:11,943 --> 00:23:14,336
All right, one of you goes
or we all die here.

367
00:23:18,696 --> 00:23:20,393
All right, fine, fine.

368
00:23:21,578 --> 00:23:24,687
I threw a flashlight over there
somewhere. You might need it.

369
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,273
Listen...

370
00:23:29,507 --> 00:23:31,765
stay on the shoulder
the whole time, okay?

371
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:34,593
If you see any headlights
or you hear any engines,

372
00:23:35,866 --> 00:23:37,275
get low and hide,

373
00:23:37,371 --> 00:23:39,165
all right?
Now, you're gonna
want to head

374
00:23:39,682 --> 00:23:40,675
southeast.

375
00:23:41,813 --> 00:23:44,167
Stanley, that doesn't mean
anything to me.

376
00:23:47,022 --> 00:23:48,373
Stay on this road.

377
00:23:48,488 --> 00:23:50,109
Stay on this road
and then you make...

378
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,633
make your first left

379
00:23:51,883 --> 00:23:53,697
Okay?
And you're gonna go about a mile

380
00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:55,656
and then you're gonna make
your second right,

381
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:59,041
and you're gonna make another right
and then another left.

382
00:23:59,118 --> 00:24:02,175
And then once you get to the crossroads
of the highway, you're home free...

383
00:24:02,668 --> 00:24:05,272
You'll see a big sign pointing
to the way to Jericho, okay?

384
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:06,526
Got it?

385
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,880
Left, second right.

386
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:10,645
Right, left,

387
00:24:10,684 --> 00:24:11,484
Right.

388
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:17,621
Mimi, I...

389
00:24:17,852 --> 00:24:18,914
Don't worry.

390
00:24:19,608 --> 00:24:20,573
Don't worry.

391
00:24:20,823 --> 00:24:21,942
I'll be careful.

392
00:24:36,535 --> 00:24:37,924
<i>Here's what we're gonna do:</i>

393
00:24:37,925 --> 00:24:39,737
I know a place that's safe.

394
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:42,361
We take Darcy and the kids
out of Jericho

395
00:24:42,457 --> 00:24:45,061
and stash them before you and I
get back on the move.

396
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,039
I am not leaving them alone.

397
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,775
- I don't think you have a choice.
- No...

398
00:24:48,776 --> 00:24:51,013
See, because I've got leverage.

399
00:24:51,476 --> 00:24:54,408
If they kill me, they will
never find the package.

400
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:56,549
It's not you
they're gonna kill.

401
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:59,674
It'll be Sam
or Darcy or me;

402
00:25:00,851 --> 00:25:03,359
anything they can use
to get to you.

403
00:25:07,933 --> 00:25:10,325
Anything they can
use to get to me.

404
00:25:14,616 --> 00:25:15,793
The body.

405
00:25:16,632 --> 00:25:19,101
These... These, uh...

406
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:23,756
...these half-smashed drives,

407
00:25:24,682 --> 00:25:26,650
<i>...this whole...</i>

408
00:25:27,036 --> 00:25:28,386
this whole setup--

409
00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:30,643
If someone had wanted
to destroy all this,

410
00:25:30,644 --> 00:25:32,254
why leave the house
standing, huh?

411
00:25:32,466 --> 00:25:34,492
Why not just burn it all down?

412
00:25:35,157 --> 00:25:37,010
Someone wanted us
to see all this.

413
00:25:45,906 --> 00:25:47,179
We're being played.

414
00:25:47,816 --> 00:25:49,658
Why would anyone go through
all that trouble?

415
00:25:49,908 --> 00:25:50,931
I don't know,

416
00:25:51,394 --> 00:25:52,667
but this is all too big now.

417
00:25:52,668 --> 00:25:54,123
There's too many angles
to cover.

418
00:25:54,124 --> 00:25:55,358
Too many unknowns.

419
00:25:57,133 --> 00:25:58,232
I need to get home.

420
00:25:58,233 --> 00:25:59,525
- Robert, wait.
- What?

421
00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:03,036
Let's think about this.

422
00:26:03,037 --> 00:26:04,869
What's the plan?
What are you going to do?

423
00:26:05,114 --> 00:26:08,625
You know, maybe the plan all
along was to get us out here.

424
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:11,152
I gotta protect
my family, Sarah.

425
00:26:12,194 --> 00:26:13,525
And what about the package?

426
00:26:16,786 --> 00:26:18,319
It'll need to be moved.

427
00:26:33,831 --> 00:26:35,491
This isn't so bad, right?

428
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,063
Hey, we've been
through worse.

429
00:26:37,106 --> 00:26:38,837
Remember the time we got stuck on
the roof of the...

430
00:26:38,838 --> 00:26:40,904
town hall in the middle
of a lightning storm, huh?

431
00:26:41,271 --> 00:26:43,200
We were so afraid the lightning
was going to...

432
00:26:43,566 --> 00:26:44,955
blow up the fireworks.

433
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,793
You squealed like a little girl
wanting to jump off that roof.

434
00:26:48,794 --> 00:26:49,681
That was you.

435
00:26:50,028 --> 00:26:51,571
Your voice hadn't changed yet.

436
00:26:52,227 --> 00:26:54,832
Please, I had you beat by,
like, six months.

437
00:26:57,583 --> 00:26:58,837
Drink some water.

438
00:27:00,072 --> 00:27:01,114
It's frozen right through.

439
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:02,484
What?

440
00:27:08,474 --> 00:27:11,541
I saw an abandoned cabin about
a quarter mile up the road.

441
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,757
You need to get inside.

442
00:27:14,223 --> 00:27:15,921
It'll hurt, but you can make it.

443
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,657
- Jake, I'm staying.
- Listen to me!

444
00:27:18,356 --> 00:27:21,675
There's no point in both of us
freezing to death out there.

445
00:27:22,253 --> 00:27:24,279
- She's coming back.
- When?

446
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:27,058
She's been gone for, like,
an hour.

447
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,016
It'll take her a little while to
reach the patrol,

448
00:27:29,017 --> 00:27:30,675
but when she does,
she'll find someone.

449
00:27:30,676 --> 00:27:31,852
I know she'll find someone.

450
00:27:32,624 --> 00:27:34,341
Unless somebody finds her first.

451
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,845
Look,

452
00:27:35,881 --> 00:27:38,235
it's gonna get dark soon,
you need to go.

453
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:49,197
You wouldn't leave me
any more than I'm leaving you.

454
00:27:52,535 --> 00:27:54,541
Mimi's strong.
She'll find her way.

455
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,298
Wait...

456
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:10,053
he said keep going east.

457
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,082
No... southeast.

458
00:28:14,765 --> 00:28:18,160
And... look for a sign.

459
00:28:31,224 --> 00:28:33,153
Oh, God, I hate this place!

460
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:07,228
Come on, man.

461
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:08,892
You can't fall asleep.

462
00:29:08,988 --> 00:29:10,319
You got to stay up;
come on.

463
00:29:10,352 --> 00:29:11,645
You stopped shivering.
Come on.

464
00:29:11,646 --> 00:29:13,627
You got to talk to me--
come on, come on, buddy.

465
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:14,930
You gotta talk to me.

466
00:29:14,969 --> 00:29:16,396
Talk to me, buddy.
Come on.

467
00:29:16,744 --> 00:29:17,941
I'm sorry.

468
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:19,156
I'm really sorry.

469
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,411
About what?

470
00:29:21,142 --> 00:29:22,647
Five years ago.

471
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,672
Sorry I left the way I did.

472
00:29:25,251 --> 00:29:26,794
Iit's okay. It doesn't matter.

473
00:29:27,045 --> 00:29:28,010
Doesn't matter.

474
00:29:28,011 --> 00:29:29,387
I was gonna call.

475
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:32,859
I was gonna call.

476
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,570
I know. Listen, I want you
to forget about it, okay?

477
00:29:35,571 --> 00:29:37,892
We never got to go backpacking
in Costa Rica.

478
00:29:37,893 --> 00:29:38,693
You know what?

479
00:29:39,232 --> 00:29:41,248
We're still gonna get to go
backpacking in Costa Rica, okay?

480
00:29:41,249 --> 00:29:42,558
We're gonna...

481
00:29:42,751 --> 00:29:43,967
we're gonna learn how to surf.

482
00:29:43,968 --> 00:29:45,645
We're gonna sleep
on the beach.

483
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:47,804
As soon as the planes
are up and running again,

484
00:29:47,805 --> 00:29:49,051
it's gonna be you and me.

485
00:29:49,186 --> 00:29:51,539
Hell, you can fly us
there yourself, huh?

486
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,172
Come on. Come on.
Tell me something good, man.

487
00:29:54,173 --> 00:29:57,236
I haven't talked to you in five years.
You've been gone for five years.

488
00:29:58,369 --> 00:30:00,511
Tell me... Hey, tell me
about San Diego.

489
00:30:00,512 --> 00:30:01,616
How was it?

490
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,374
- Warm.
- Warm, right.

491
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,825
Beaches, blondes, huh?

492
00:30:07,993 --> 00:30:09,594
What were you doing there?

493
00:30:09,672 --> 00:30:11,774
Flying, flying planes.

494
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:14,533
Really?
That's cool, man.

495
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:17,099
Your grandfather
would've been psyched, huh?

496
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:19,696
Did you have a girl there?
I know you had a girl.

497
00:30:20,044 --> 00:30:21,452
She's dead.

498
00:30:27,186 --> 00:30:28,421
What do you mean?

499
00:30:29,212 --> 00:30:30,697
You don't know that.

500
00:30:30,698 --> 00:30:33,581
I mean, it all depends on where she was
when the bombs went off, right?

501
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,167
I mean, she could
have made it, right?

502
00:30:35,186 --> 00:30:37,067
- Tell me what her name was.
- She's dead....

503
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,321
It was my fault.

504
00:30:38,322 --> 00:30:39,988
- It's not your fault.
- Let me lay down.

505
00:30:39,989 --> 00:30:41,243
- Jake, no.
- Let me lay down.

506
00:30:41,244 --> 00:30:43,115
It wasn't your fault.
Come on... Come on...

507
00:30:43,365 --> 00:30:45,266
Come on, stay with me.
You gotta stay with me.

508
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,777
Come on, Jake.

509
00:30:49,069 --> 00:30:51,018
Stay with me, Jake.
Come on, man.

510
00:30:54,008 --> 00:30:55,223
Stay with me.

511
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:15,489
Come on!

512
00:31:22,531 --> 00:31:24,846
Okay, gotta keep moving.

513
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,466
Gotta keep moving.

514
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,399
Please don't hurt me...
please don't hurt me.

515
00:31:54,438 --> 00:31:55,962
Please don't hurt me!

516
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,679
Please don't hurt me...

517
00:31:58,026 --> 00:31:59,053
Mimi?

518
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:05,221
- It's Gail and Johnston Green, honey.
You're safe.  - Oh, thanks God!

519
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,132
Come on, baby,
let's get out of here.

520
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,502
Come on.

521
00:32:16,681 --> 00:32:18,032
Those are hideous.

522
00:32:18,033 --> 00:32:20,038
Are those the sheets
from your old apartment?

523
00:32:20,385 --> 00:32:22,701
Because you can't expect
anyone to sleep on those.

524
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:26,130
If anyone asks, we'll pretend
someone else donated them.

525
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:36,393
Your dress.

526
00:32:38,978 --> 00:32:40,599
Guess I shouldn't be seeing this, huh?

527
00:32:42,065 --> 00:32:44,187
The day's sort of come and gone, so...

528
00:32:46,115 --> 00:32:47,215
It'll come again.

529
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:48,932
You think?

530
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:51,827
I do.

531
00:32:53,293 --> 00:32:55,319
I tell you what, I've got
a pack of Ramen noodles

532
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,920
with your name on it,
what do you say?

533
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,238
Great. I'll deliver this to the shelter
and come back and wash up.

534
00:33:00,797 --> 00:33:02,206
Roger, wait.

535
00:33:03,883 --> 00:33:05,253
I'll come with you.

536
00:33:21,826 --> 00:33:23,485
It's Mom and Dad, honey!

537
00:33:24,121 --> 00:33:25,973
Stanley, you all right, sweetheart?

538
00:33:26,898 --> 00:33:29,001
You need to go get in the truck
and get warm, pal.

539
00:33:29,002 --> 00:33:30,680
- Where's Mimi?
- I'm right here.

540
00:33:30,739 --> 00:33:32,051
Stanley, I'm right here.

541
00:33:34,732 --> 00:33:36,642
Wake up. Wake up!

542
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:38,687
Wake up, Jake.

543
00:33:39,092 --> 00:33:40,095
Wake up.

544
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,500
Wake up. Oh, thank God.

545
00:33:41,501 --> 00:33:42,850
We're gonna help you, honey.

546
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:46,400
We saw the storm coming

547
00:33:46,709 --> 00:33:48,870
and we started to worry
when you hadn't come back.

548
00:33:48,871 --> 00:33:49,969
Sweetheart...

549
00:33:52,709 --> 00:33:53,558
Honey,

550
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:55,776
we're not gonna be able
to get this truck off of him.

551
00:33:55,777 --> 00:33:57,666
I need you to take
these guys back to town

552
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:59,175
and get me some help out here.

553
00:33:59,176 --> 00:34:01,833
You signal when you're coming back
so I know it's you, all right?

554
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:04,244
- I'll flash the lights.
- All right, go, go, go!

555
00:34:06,422 --> 00:34:07,850
Jake, look at me, son.

556
00:34:07,851 --> 00:34:08,853
Lookie here.

557
00:34:09,161 --> 00:34:11,380
You're gonna make it, son...
I know you.

558
00:34:12,364 --> 00:34:15,065
I know what you're made of.
You're gonna be all right.

559
00:34:15,605 --> 00:34:18,209
You're gonna make it.
Stay with me now.

560
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:34,354
Robert, please,
the kids are sleeping.

561
00:34:34,913 --> 00:34:37,479
- I'm sorry.
- What on earth are you doing?

562
00:34:37,822 --> 00:34:39,346
Oh, I'm sorry.

563
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,971
Jake, you'll be home real soon,

564
00:34:54,377 --> 00:34:56,460
but you got to stay
with me now. Come on.

565
00:34:58,823 --> 00:35:00,666
Leave me here.
Leave me alone.

566
00:35:00,936 --> 00:35:02,595
Now, I'm not going anywhere.

567
00:35:03,155 --> 00:35:04,717
But you got to hang on.

568
00:35:05,026 --> 00:35:06,917
Now, they'll be here soon, son.

569
00:35:08,962 --> 00:35:09,974
Dad...

570
00:35:10,591 --> 00:35:11,836
I'm sorry.

571
00:35:12,681 --> 00:35:14,803
Oh, son, you got nothing
to be sorry about.

572
00:35:19,627 --> 00:35:21,575
Open your eyes, Jake.
Come on, now.

573
00:35:22,424 --> 00:35:24,566
Look at me.
Look at me, Jake.

574
00:35:26,842 --> 00:35:28,328
I can see her.

575
00:35:30,373 --> 00:35:31,511
See who?

576
00:35:33,112 --> 00:35:34,482
The girl.

577
00:35:36,777 --> 00:35:38,417
What... girl?

578
00:35:38,418 --> 00:35:40,154
Jake, I think you're hallucinating, son.

579
00:35:40,155 --> 00:35:41,177
No, listen to me.

580
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,286
When I was in Iraq...

581
00:35:47,698 --> 00:35:49,299
... there was a girl.

582
00:35:51,634 --> 00:35:53,351
She couldn't have been more than...

583
00:35:54,042 --> 00:35:55,199
10 or 12...

584
00:35:56,106 --> 00:35:57,457
Don't talk now, son.

585
00:35:57,649 --> 00:35:58,672
You save your energy.

586
00:35:58,673 --> 00:36:00,293
We'll talk when we get... home.

587
00:36:01,605 --> 00:36:03,109
I killed her, Dad.

588
00:36:08,994 --> 00:36:10,691
I killed a little girl.

589
00:36:35,136 --> 00:36:36,467
Hurry up!

590
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:50,994
Open your eyes, Jake.

591
00:36:50,995 --> 00:36:52,364
Open your eyes.

592
00:36:53,656 --> 00:36:55,430
All right, everyone on three...

593
00:36:55,431 --> 00:36:56,434
One,

594
00:36:56,762 --> 00:36:58,247
two, three!

595
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,690
All right, he's free.

596
00:37:05,192 --> 00:37:06,484
Let's get the board in here.

597
00:37:07,488 --> 00:37:09,321
One, two, three.

598
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,263
You were right.

599
00:37:21,264 --> 00:37:24,195
I need to get my family
as far away from me as possible.

600
00:37:25,102 --> 00:37:26,606
I've been thinking, and...

601
00:37:27,397 --> 00:37:29,057
There's no other choice.

602
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,317
You're doing the right thing.

603
00:37:33,764 --> 00:37:34,844
Listen.

604
00:37:36,774 --> 00:37:38,163
After they're safe,

605
00:37:38,684 --> 00:37:40,536
you and me need
to get back in the field.

606
00:37:41,037 --> 00:37:42,966
That's half our team gone, Sarah,

607
00:37:42,967 --> 00:37:45,181
and whoever did that
did it for a reason.

608
00:37:48,171 --> 00:37:49,850
How are you gonna tell Darcy?

609
00:37:52,916 --> 00:37:54,711
I'll tell her after I've moved them.

610
00:37:55,945 --> 00:37:58,608
She'll never agree if she knows
I won't be staying with them.

611
00:38:09,335 --> 00:38:11,264
He's better off here
than the med center.

612
00:38:11,515 --> 00:38:14,640
We're still on emergency power,
and it's... it's warmer here.

613
00:38:16,203 --> 00:38:17,534
Here, honey.

614
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:19,421
What about his injuries?

615
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,335
Well, the cut on his head
isn't very deep,

616
00:38:21,336 --> 00:38:23,472
and neither one
of his legs are broken.

617
00:38:24,205 --> 00:38:25,420
He's very lucky.

618
00:38:25,421 --> 00:38:26,732
I'm freezing.

619
00:38:27,157 --> 00:38:28,970
I'm gonna go get you
some more blankets.

620
00:38:29,452 --> 00:38:30,976
You're still hypothermic.

621
00:38:30,977 --> 00:38:33,986
It's just gonna take a few hours
for your body to stabilize.

622
00:38:35,683 --> 00:38:37,825
- Can we have a minute?
- Oh, sure.

623
00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:54,552
Dad...

624
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:00,745
What I told you out there...

625
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:05,221
please forget it.

626
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:08,076
Please.

627
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:13,266
Afraid I can't do that.

628
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:27,983
I've seen a lot of things
in my time, Jake.

629
00:39:30,337 --> 00:39:31,552
I've been to war.

630
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:36,240
I know what war can do.
I know what men can do... Terrible...

631
00:39:37,649 --> 00:39:39,135
... terrible things.

632
00:39:42,042 --> 00:39:43,393
I know what I did.

633
00:39:46,055 --> 00:39:47,560
You can talk to me.

634
00:40:13,026 --> 00:40:14,434
When you're ready, son.

635
00:40:17,773 --> 00:40:18,988
When you're ready.

636
00:40:37,027 --> 00:40:38,396
You okay?

637
00:40:46,692 --> 00:40:47,965
How's the sprain?

638
00:40:49,509 --> 00:40:52,538
I think it'd be better with painkillers,
but I'm not gonna complain.

639
00:40:53,444 --> 00:40:56,566
You know, for a while there, I didn't
think I'd ever feel anything again.

640
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,964
When I was out there,

641
00:41:01,485 --> 00:41:02,817
just for a moment,

642
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,653
I didn't think
I was gonna make it.

643
00:41:06,696 --> 00:41:09,359
And I stopped... to rest.

644
00:41:10,246 --> 00:41:12,735
And then I just didn't
even want to move.

645
00:41:16,323 --> 00:41:17,500
But you did.

646
00:41:19,005 --> 00:41:20,317
You did make it.

647
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:23,346
And I knew you would.

648
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:31,873
Your lips are still cold.

649
00:41:34,168 --> 00:41:36,020
Maybe you can warm them.

650
00:41:40,612 --> 00:41:42,869
That's the worst line
I've ever heard.

651
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:45,300
I know. I've got others.

652
00:41:46,535 --> 00:41:48,136
- Shut up.
- Okay.

653
00:41:58,965 --> 00:42:00,298
Tomorrow morning...

654
00:42:02,459 --> 00:42:03,533
we're leaving.

655
00:42:04,842 --> 00:42:06,670
We're leaving?
For... for where?

656
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,818
I don't know yet.

657
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,052
You don't know?

658
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,004
Darcy, when I came
to get you in DC...

659
00:42:21,116 --> 00:42:22,783
I told you it wasn't safe,

660
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,006
but I couldn't tell you why.

661
00:42:30,538 --> 00:42:31,736
I'm going for a walk.

662
00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:46,896
I have something
in my possession.

663
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,926
And there's people
out there that want it,

664
00:42:51,481 --> 00:42:53,654
that will stop at nothing to get it.

665
00:42:55,971 --> 00:42:57,571
And that puts you,
me and the kids

666
00:42:57,966 --> 00:42:59,092
in danger here.

667
00:43:05,246 --> 00:43:07,350
Okay, so th... then we go.

668
00:43:08,693 --> 00:43:09,898
<i>I trust you.</i>

669
00:43:15,607 --> 00:43:16,772
<i>Robert, do y...</i>

670
00:43:18,225 --> 00:43:19,292
Do you trust me?

671
00:43:22,285 --> 00:43:24,568
- You're late.
- You're impatient.

672
00:43:29,861 --> 00:43:31,352
Then listen to me.

673
00:43:32,231 --> 00:43:34,395
Okay, Sarah is not on our side.

674
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:36,281
Now... whatever's...

675
00:43:36,784 --> 00:43:38,108
gone on between the two of you,

676
00:43:38,109 --> 00:43:40,429
I'm telling you, Robert,
she's not here to help us.

677
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,437
Have you located the package?

678
00:43:46,148 --> 00:43:47,153
Soon.

679
00:43:48,596 --> 00:43:50,533
Hawkins is starting to put
the pieces together.

680
00:43:50,534 --> 00:43:53,062
- He needs to be eliminated.
- I know.

681
00:43:53,278 --> 00:43:56,183
We've already eliminated the other
three targets without incident.

682
00:43:56,184 --> 00:43:57,863
Why are you stalling on this one?

683
00:44:08,856 --> 00:44:10,624
Because this one is different.
