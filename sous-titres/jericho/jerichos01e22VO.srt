<i>Previously on </i>Jericho

2
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:05,398
Oh, my God... Ted !

3
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:07,053
We grew up together over in New Bern.

4
00:00:07,153 --> 00:00:09,441
- You just going to leave?
- It won't be for very long.

5
00:00:10,255 --> 00:00:11,913
Johnston, you SOB.

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,717
How the hell did you lose an election?

7
00:00:13,817 --> 00:00:16,473
No. The question is, how did you get
to be in charge in New Bern?

8
00:00:16,485 --> 00:00:17,941
They get tired of you being sheriff?

9
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:19,458
<i>Can we buy some more of these things?

10
00:00:19,482 --> 00:00:21,364
Ten wind turbines for, let's say...

11
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:22,729
ten percent of your spring crop.

12
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:24,615
Okay, we'll give you the food.

13
00:00:24,715 --> 00:00:27,080
We're going to need ten Jericho men
to help us build them.

14
00:00:27,283 --> 00:00:28,817
It wasn't safe for us there anymore.

15
00:00:28,942 --> 00:00:31,838
<i>You can't just ride into New Bern
and start breaking china.

16
00:00:32,454 --> 00:00:34,394
It's a full inventory of Jericho.

17
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:36,373
They slid it up like they own it.

18
00:00:36,516 --> 00:00:37,877
They're making mortar rounds.

19
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,465
They're getting ready for war.

20
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:40,628
Hold it!

21
00:00:41,507 --> 00:00:44,072
We wanted to break the machine.
Stop the factory.

22
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,212
Where's Heather?

23
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:46,917
She's dead, Jake.

24
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:50,015
Everybody go!

25
00:00:50,516 --> 00:00:52,534
<i>Jericho is about to be invaded.

26
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,531
<i>We'll do this day and night
for as long as it takes.

27
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:59,754
Most of you have no idea of
what's coming.

28
00:01:00,088 --> 00:01:02,028
This isn't a fight about land.

29
00:01:02,513 --> 00:01:05,116
This is a fight for our very existence.

30
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:29,706
I know this has great artistic merit,
but...

31
00:01:30,072 --> 00:01:31,799
i'm taking these shoes off
in ten minutes.

32
00:01:31,852 --> 00:01:33,332
So, if you don't want
to have to hide my toes...

33
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:35,010
Oh, Gail, make yourself comfortable.

34
00:01:35,135 --> 00:01:37,435
We can't really do this
without the best man anyway.

35
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:38,765
Where is Jake?

36
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:41,460
I don't see him.

37
00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:43,619
Grandpa seems to be missing, too.

38
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,997
Take a wild guess where they are.

39
00:01:46,764 --> 00:01:47,765
Right.

40
00:01:50,922 --> 00:01:53,206
Oh, Beth.
It's so nice to see you, dear.

41
00:02:11,647 --> 00:02:12,729
I need your help.

42
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:15,132
We need to go over
to the medical center.

43
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:30,425
- Is everyone in there?
- Yeah. We're just waiting for you.

44
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,390
How is it going out there?

45
00:02:33,515 --> 00:02:35,127
They took Talbot's farm.

46
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,332
How many men?

47
00:02:36,926 --> 00:02:38,804
I'd say 60... 70.

48
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,029
That's probably just
an advance team.

49
00:02:41,264 --> 00:02:43,832
I would imagine they got more than that
up the road in reserve.

50
00:02:43,895 --> 00:02:46,959
Constantino has us outnumbered
and outgunned.

51
00:02:47,342 --> 00:02:50,061
If we split our force, and try
to defend each one of these farms,

52
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:51,465
he's goino toverwhelm us.

53
00:02:51,575 --> 00:02:52,967
So what are you saying?

54
00:02:53,188 --> 00:02:54,356
I'm saying we don't split up.

55
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:56,863
We choose a place to stand together,

56
00:02:57,097 --> 00:02:59,424
deliver a good, hard counterpunch.
Let them know that,

57
00:02:59,524 --> 00:03:02,256
if they intend to take from us,
it's going to cost them dearly.

58
00:03:02,631 --> 00:03:03,632
How?

59
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:05,535
Well, right here.
Stanley Richmond's farm.

60
00:03:05,635 --> 00:03:07,724
It's the last place
before this road divides,

61
00:03:07,824 --> 00:03:10,109
and they start taking ground
faster than we can keep up.

62
00:03:10,171 --> 00:03:12,612
Plus which it's the highest point
in the whole area.

63
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,720
There's where we make our stand.

64
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,987
Deputy Perkins just radioed back.

65
00:03:25,088 --> 00:03:26,640
He told the farm is secured.

66
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:30,163
Let's go get the rest of them.

67
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:33,865
Let's go!

68
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:08,288
This one's alive.

<i>6 YEARS AGO

74
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,741
- Grandpa, you're drunk.
- Yeah!

75
00:04:39,091 --> 00:04:40,449
Thank you, darling

76
00:04:40,549 --> 00:04:41,923
Keep 'em coming.

77
00:04:43,127 --> 00:04:45,660
Gail's going to get so mad at you
for getting her boy drunk.

78
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,268
I've got Gail wrapped
around my little finger.

79
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:51,484
Says the guy who taught me
to fly his crop duster when I was 13,

80
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:53,878
then told Mom I was lying
when I mentioned it.

81
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:56,717
I was so jealous.
My mom knew that you let him fly,

82
00:04:56,817 --> 00:04:59,341
and she wouldn't let me go
anywhere near you.

83
00:04:59,888 --> 00:05:00,905
You see, Jake would...

84
00:05:01,015 --> 00:05:03,757
Jake would come over and tell me
all the stories you told him.

85
00:05:03,944 --> 00:05:04,946
I loved...

86
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,933
I loved the one about the peanuts.

87
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:10,977
What the hell are you talking about?

88
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:15,138
The peanuts in World War II.

89
00:05:16,405 --> 00:05:18,310
He means the "Nuts" story, Grandpa.

90
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,743
Not peanuts.
There were no peanuts involved.

91
00:05:20,843 --> 00:05:23,356
So what's the story?
Tell me the story, somebody.

92
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,803
What? It's his story.

93
00:05:24,903 --> 00:05:25,911
All right.

94
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:30,644
World War II.
The winter of 1944.

95
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:33,933
The Nazis penetrated the Allied lines,

96
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:35,747
and surrounded...

97
00:05:36,264 --> 00:05:39,487
a division of Americans
in a little town called Bastogne,

98
00:05:40,371 --> 00:05:44,047
freezing, starving and running out
of ammunition, but they knew...

99
00:05:44,188 --> 00:05:46,128
that they had to hold that ground.

100
00:05:46,238 --> 00:05:47,724
Just before Christmas,

101
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,537
the Nazis sent a note

102
00:05:50,637 --> 00:05:52,379
to the American commander

103
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,598
telling him that he could

104
00:05:54,698 --> 00:05:56,718
surrender and save the rt of his men,

105
00:05:56,818 --> 00:05:58,559
or they could stay and fight.

106
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:00,452
The American commander

107
00:06:00,585 --> 00:06:03,996
sent a one-word reply
to the Wehrmacht commander,

108
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:07,199
and it said...
- ... "Nuts."

109
00:06:09,515 --> 00:06:10,742
Why did he say, "Nuts"?

110
00:06:10,842 --> 00:06:12,489
It means, "Go to hell!"

111
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:14,091
Why didn't he just say, "Go to hell"?

112
00:06:14,191 --> 00:06:15,495
Because he said, "Nuts. "

113
00:06:19,015 --> 00:06:21,534
Gail, my sweetheart,
you look beautiful.

114
00:06:21,683 --> 00:06:22,794
Save it, Dal.

115
00:06:22,997 --> 00:06:25,547
Was it your idea
to get my son drunk tonight?

116
00:06:29,364 --> 00:06:32,603
Right. Okay.
Everybody back to the reception.

117
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:35,036
- Come on.
- But I'm hammered.

118
00:06:35,803 --> 00:06:37,242
And I want to talk to you.

119
00:06:38,118 --> 00:06:39,792
Have a cup of coffee, Stanley.

120
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:42,194
Here.

121
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,932
Well, what's this?

122
00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:48,042
As your brother's best man,
you are required to give a toast,

123
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:50,111
so I wrote down a few thoughts,

124
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:52,383
some things that
you might want to say.

125
00:06:52,923 --> 00:06:54,753
You think I was going to wing it?

126
00:06:58,497 --> 00:07:00,766
Let's go take some pictures, okay?

127
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:08,475
What's going on?

128
00:07:15,183 --> 00:07:18,343
Mr. Green, I have access
to a keyhole military satellite

129
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:22,325
that I can use to track New Bern's
movements in the field today.

130
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:24,262
- Beg pardon?
- It's real.

131
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:25,657
The one restriction...

132
00:07:25,775 --> 00:07:29,279
is that no one can know
where you're getting this information.

133
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:32,925
Tell them I'm... scouting in the field,
tell them what you want...

134
00:07:33,025 --> 00:07:35,181
but the satellite must remain a secret.

135
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:39,531
Sounds good.

136
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,956
- That's it?
- What do you want me to say?

137
00:07:42,073 --> 00:07:44,480
I get it. Man has a satellite.
Doesn't want anyone to know.

138
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,454
- But...
- I am about to go to war,

139
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:49,288
with New Bern, Kansas,
the home of the nearest Costco.

140
00:07:49,484 --> 00:07:52,144
Today is already just about
as weird as I can handle.

141
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:54,170
I'm not asking any more questions.

142
00:07:58,832 --> 00:07:59,839
Mom, Dad,

143
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:02,440
there's a chance we may have
to leave here today,

144
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:05,866
and we might not be able
to make it back, so...

145
00:08:07,493 --> 00:08:08,557
I just wanted to...

146
00:08:09,797 --> 00:08:10,939
We just...

147
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:12,801
wanted to pay our respects.

148
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,477
Remember I told you about that witch,
from the IRS?

149
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:17,823
The one that wanted

150
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:20,393
to take everything
you've ever worked for?

151
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,691
Mom, Dad...

152
00:08:22,646 --> 00:08:23,944
this is Mimi.

153
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:31,720
Hello.

154
00:08:32,674 --> 00:08:34,332
It's nice to finally meet you.

155
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,013
I really love your son.

156
00:08:40,296 --> 00:08:42,423
And, of course,
Bonnie is...

157
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,972
she's just wonderful.

158
00:08:44,715 --> 00:08:47,709
And I've really enjoyed
living with them and...

159
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,946
- Oh, great.
- What?

160
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,676
I didn't say we were living together.

161
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:55,273
We're not married.

162
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,551
I'm so sorry.
I certainly... I...

163
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:06,401
Is everything a joke to you?

164
00:09:09,943 --> 00:09:12,837
I figure one day we're going
to be buried here ourselves,

165
00:09:13,212 --> 00:09:14,214
and I...

166
00:09:15,262 --> 00:09:16,654
think it would be nice if...

167
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:19,694
our kids came and,
and joked around with us.

168
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,686
I hope that's not
for a really long time.

169
00:09:44,348 --> 00:09:45,348
How we doing?

170
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:48,332
We've got about 200 men.
That includes Dale's crew.

171
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,263
We got more coming, right?

172
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:53,580
They're trickling in. It's taking
a lot longer than we thought.

173
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:56,850
Saying good-bye to their families.

174
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,030
Get on down to the pass.
Get everybody organized.

175
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,779
We don't have a whole lot of time
before their advance unit hits.

176
00:10:03,022 --> 00:10:04,852
- Not you.
- Why not?

177
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:07,661
Because these people
elected you their leader.

178
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:09,573
We protect you at all costs.

179
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,382
And, besides, in a few minutes,
I'm going to need your help.

180
00:10:12,507 --> 00:10:13,510
Help with what?

181
00:10:15,111 --> 00:10:16,175
Arming our tank.

182
00:10:24,342 --> 00:10:27,455
Our daughter is out there carrying
a rifle and... I'm in here.

183
00:10:27,565 --> 00:10:29,145
Sam needs you here.

184
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,164
You know, Allie's safe.

185
00:10:32,927 --> 00:10:34,270
She's been assigned to Town Hall,

186
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,400
and the fighting is miles from there.

187
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,897
Right now, there really isn't
anything else you can be doing.

188
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:45,569
Here we go.

189
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:53,655
<i>Jake, you are about
to have company.

190
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:54,784
Already?

191
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:57,163
<i>New Bern is on its way.
There are...

192
00:10:57,429 --> 00:10:59,338
<i>70, maybe... 80 men.

193
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:01,176
Is that tank there yet?

194
00:11:01,426 --> 00:11:04,418
They're trying to load it
with that mortar round right now.

195
00:11:06,014 --> 00:11:07,626
I think you're gonna need it.

196
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:11,732
All right, let's get ready!
They're coming!

197
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,626
Get some ammo down here!

198
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:19,367
What is it?

199
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:27,205
I'm being tracked.

200
00:11:28,336 --> 00:11:29,822
Tracked?
What do you mean?

201
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:33,108
Someone is trying to trace my location
through the satellite.

202
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:35,830
- Well, can they?
- If they have time, yes.

203
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,779
Do you know who it is?

204
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,846
My guess is, it's... Valente.

205
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,447
What him?
From... Homeland Security?

206
00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:50,418
I don't know who he's working for now,

207
00:11:50,518 --> 00:11:52,640
but he told Sarah
to get the bomb any way she could

208
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,411
and to eliminate all witnesses.

209
00:11:57,278 --> 00:11:58,467
All the witnesses.

210
00:11:59,061 --> 00:12:00,798
- Shut it down.
- No, I can't.

211
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:04,952
We just have to make sure we disconnect
the feed before he finishes the trace.

212
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,002
I don't get it.

213
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,888
- Why are they just standing there?
- I don't know.

214
00:13:59,968 --> 00:14:01,376
Do we fire the first shot?

215
00:14:11,156 --> 00:14:12,235
New Bern's here.

216
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:14,801
Get into position.

217
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,724
We're gonna need that tank.

218
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:07,664
Having a good time?

219
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:12,193
By the way, I think I saw April
making out with Shep Cale.

220
00:15:12,293 --> 00:15:13,443
All right, all right.

221
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,235
You need to stop drinking.

222
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:17,631
Listen.

223
00:15:20,178 --> 00:15:22,162
Read this.
It's a speech.

224
00:15:22,308 --> 00:15:24,932
Figure you should have something ready,
so you don't embarrass yourself.

225
00:15:25,048 --> 00:15:28,052
You mean so I don't embarrass you,
because you don't have to worry.

226
00:15:28,758 --> 00:15:30,808
Is that how you spell
"venereal disease"?

227
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:32,872
This day is important to me, okay?

228
00:15:33,335 --> 00:15:34,777
Just because your life's a big joke

229
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,923
doesn't mean you have
to treat mine that way.

230
00:15:37,135 --> 00:15:38,598
Why is my life a joke?

231
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:40,587
- Just read the speech.
- No, seriously, Eric,

232
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:43,707
why is my life a joke?
- I'm not getting into this right now.

233
00:15:45,617 --> 00:15:46,621
All right.

234
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:51,832
You think people don't wonder
what you've been doing?

235
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:54,495
You spend all that time
in flight school getting your license.

236
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:56,308
Instead of using it,
you come back here,

237
00:15:56,424 --> 00:15:58,585
hanging out like it's the summer
after high school.

238
00:15:58,806 --> 00:16:01,217
Hauling stuff for Emily's dad.

239
00:16:01,391 --> 00:16:04,439
If I'm such a joke,
then why'd you want me as your best man?

240
00:16:12,648 --> 00:16:14,162
You didn't want me, did you?

241
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,359
No, not really.

242
00:16:32,098 --> 00:16:33,558
Where's that tank?

243
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:35,703
We're not going to last long
against those trucks.

244
00:16:35,803 --> 00:16:37,112
We have to hold out.

245
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:43,934
Damn it!

246
00:16:49,815 --> 00:16:52,620
- Got to keep drawing their fire,
all right?  - Got It.

247
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,313
Give me another mag.

248
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:01,503
Where are you going?

249
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,108
We'll never get a clean shot from here.
I need to get up that hill...

250
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,359
and shot on the gunner.

251
00:17:06,073 --> 00:17:07,596
- I got your back.
- All right.

252
00:17:07,696 --> 00:17:09,253
Cover him!

253
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:37,398
Why eliminate witnesses?

254
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:40,871
I mean, whoever's tracking you,
they either...

255
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:43,360
want to use the bomb
for themselves or...

256
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:46,234
they want to keep you
from using it, but...

257
00:17:46,393 --> 00:17:48,998
either way,
what difference do witnesses make?

258
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,877
The bombs have fingerprints,
don't they? Something that...

259
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:54,597
make them traceable.
I remember reading that.

260
00:18:20,545 --> 00:18:22,416
It's the uranium.
It has...

261
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:26,872
It has a specific signature.

262
00:18:27,663 --> 00:18:30,363
It places the origin of the device
where it was made.

263
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,531
So there were dozens of these things
used in the attacks, right?

264
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,846
And now you have the last one.

265
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:41,594
I don't think these people are looking
at this thing as a weapon.

266
00:18:41,694 --> 00:18:43,106
It's more than that.
It's...

267
00:18:43,781 --> 00:18:44,900
Evidence.

268
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:52,801
It's the smoking gun
behind the greatest crime

269
00:18:52,955 --> 00:18:54,498
in the history of the world.

270
00:18:56,617 --> 00:18:57,673
The bomb...

271
00:18:58,295 --> 00:19:00,221
it could expose the people...

272
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,575
who were responsible for the attacks.

273
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:05,045
That's why they need it back.

274
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:23,599
Did u see what I just did?

275
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:25,316
Holy crap.
That was...

276
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,033
<i>Holy crap!

277
00:20:28,445 --> 00:20:30,216
All right, that bought us some time.

278
00:20:30,557 --> 00:20:32,773
But they'll be back,
and there'll be more of them.

279
00:20:32,946 --> 00:20:34,583
And it won't be near as easy
next time.

280
00:20:34,683 --> 00:20:36,843
Easy?
You thought that was easy?

281
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:40,991
Dad?

282
00:20:41,705 --> 00:20:42,708
What's wrong?

283
00:20:53,573 --> 00:20:54,904
Clear the table!
Clear it!

284
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,691
- Clear it!
- I'm gonna go get Kenchy.

285
00:20:56,872 --> 00:20:58,665
- Get my mom!
- We'll need towels.

286
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,123
And some antiseptic,
and some alcohol.

287
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,064
- We need alcohol.
- Get a towel!

288
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,732
Get me some alcohol!

289
00:21:07,692 --> 00:21:10,605
Here we go.
Give me that, come on!

290
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:12,573
Okay, all right.

291
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:15,834
Keep the pressure on.

292
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:17,859
What?
Keep it on! Keep the pressure.

293
00:21:18,342 --> 00:21:19,499
<i>Jake, come in.

294
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,572
Nice work out there.

295
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:26,406
<i>Tell your father that
they're coming back around.

296
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:29,246
He's been shot.

297
00:21:31,966 --> 00:21:33,220
I'm sorry.

298
00:21:39,027 --> 00:21:40,354
You know what to do, right?

299
00:21:40,484 --> 00:21:41,727
<i>Keep pressure on the wound,

300
00:21:41,827 --> 00:21:45,003
<i>and there should be some morphine
syrettes in the... supplies I gave you.

301
00:21:45,198 --> 00:21:46,452
Yeah, we've got it.

302
00:21:46,617 --> 00:21:47,687
Listen, Jake.

303
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,060
<i>People are gonna be
looking to you now.

304
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:51,632
<i>You know what I mean?

305
00:21:54,323 --> 00:21:55,867
Okay, the guys will be back.

306
00:21:56,156 --> 00:21:57,931
They retreated to Talbot's farm.

307
00:21:58,055 --> 00:22:00,582
<i>My guess is,
they're waiting for reinforcements,

308
00:22:00,682 --> 00:22:02,928
<i>so you should have a little time
to regroup out there.

309
00:22:03,043 --> 00:22:04,343
<i>Just keep the radio close,

310
00:22:04,443 --> 00:22:05,770
and I'll update you.

311
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,663
Out.

312
00:22:09,405 --> 00:22:10,408
Out.

313
00:22:22,406 --> 00:22:24,413
Please, I need to talk
whoever's in charge.

314
00:22:24,528 --> 00:22:25,528
Right over there.

315
00:22:32,604 --> 00:22:34,109
Excuse me, sir?

316
00:22:35,151 --> 00:22:36,212
Colonel Hoffman.

317
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,333
You don't have to call me sir,
unless you plan to enlist.

318
00:22:39,433 --> 00:22:42,039
There's a city called New Bern.
It has a munitions factory.

319
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:45,330
It's planning to overrun the town
of Jericho. People are gonna get killed.

320
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,359
They tried to kill me,
but I got away.

321
00:22:47,629 --> 00:22:49,717
- You've got to help these people.
- Where is this?

322
00:22:49,852 --> 00:22:51,955
Kansas, not far from
the Colorado border.

323
00:22:54,138 --> 00:22:57,027
I wish I could help. My orders are
to secure the roads in this area.

324
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,667
- But, sir...
- I don't get to make these decisions.

325
00:22:58,782 --> 00:23:00,317
I'm just a government employee.

326
00:23:02,226 --> 00:23:03,364
Which government?

327
00:23:07,248 --> 00:23:08,637
United States.

328
00:23:10,219 --> 00:23:11,880
Are you all right, ma'am?

329
00:23:12,073 --> 00:23:14,727
We heard there were six different people
claiming the presidency.

330
00:23:14,862 --> 00:23:17,803
There were. In fact, there are still
a couple of holdouts...

331
00:23:18,104 --> 00:23:20,264
Texas, a bloc in the East.

332
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:23,245
The new federal government's
been restored in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

333
00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:24,764
Colonel, this is an emergency.

334
00:23:24,872 --> 00:23:27,336
You have to go to Jericho. The fighting
could be happening right now.

335
00:23:27,452 --> 00:23:28,590
I am very sorry, ma'am.

336
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:31,303
Casper, you see she gets back
to the medical unit.

337
00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:32,422
Come on, ma'am.

338
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,166
Get 'em out.

339
00:23:45,828 --> 00:23:47,024
Get 'em out.

340
00:23:51,172 --> 00:23:52,754
Clear everyone out.

341
00:24:02,825 --> 00:24:04,116
You listen...

342
00:24:06,995 --> 00:24:11,002
This place,
is where you survive.

343
00:24:12,305 --> 00:24:15,218
You make a stand here,
you hear?

344
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,533
We will.

345
00:24:22,757 --> 00:24:25,790
I'm sorry you have to see this.

346
00:24:28,152 --> 00:24:29,653
You've been through enough.

347
00:24:29,923 --> 00:24:31,929
Dad...
Dad, stop.

348
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:34,900
You're stronger than you think
you are, though.

349
00:24:35,054 --> 00:24:36,461
Always have been.

350
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:41,766
I love you, son.

351
00:24:52,945 --> 00:24:56,750
I guess I zigged when I should've
zagged out there, huh?

352
00:25:03,705 --> 00:25:05,904
I sure wish your mother was here.

353
00:25:10,686 --> 00:25:11,767
She's coming.

354
00:25:12,808 --> 00:25:14,062
She'll be here.

355
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,053
Tell your mother I love her.

356
00:25:20,345 --> 00:25:23,342
I was... hard on you.

357
00:25:26,545 --> 00:25:30,017
I pushed you... away.

358
00:25:33,787 --> 00:25:37,934
I'm glad you... came... home.

359
00:25:45,035 --> 00:25:46,743
I'm proud of you.

360
00:27:23,645 --> 00:27:25,082
The big toast.

361
00:27:27,735 --> 00:27:29,508
Before I start,
is there anyone who...

362
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,167
hasn't written me a speech?

363
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:36,455
It really makes me wonder
how screwed up you think I am

364
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:39,195
that I can't be trusted
to say a few things...

365
00:27:39,354 --> 00:27:40,492
about my brother.

366
00:27:44,355 --> 00:27:45,607
The thing is...

367
00:27:49,465 --> 00:27:51,202
these are all pretty lame.

368
00:27:52,226 --> 00:27:55,014
Not one of them mentions
my brother's musical theater phase

369
00:27:55,114 --> 00:27:56,813
when we all thought he was gay.

370
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:57,972
Seriously.

371
00:27:59,101 --> 00:28:01,772
You have not heard disturbing
until you've heard him singing

372
00:28:01,872 --> 00:28:04,716
"One Hand, One Heart"
in the shower every morning.

373
00:28:23,815 --> 00:28:25,301
I tease my brother a lot,
but...

374
00:28:25,551 --> 00:28:26,555
the truth is...

375
00:28:28,735 --> 00:28:30,650
the truth is I'm very proud of him.

376
00:28:32,608 --> 00:28:33,616
I'm...

377
00:28:34,825 --> 00:28:37,320
I'm proud of how kind he is...

378
00:28:39,828 --> 00:28:42,336
I'm proud of how giving he is,

379
00:28:43,627 --> 00:28:44,632
and...

380
00:28:46,194 --> 00:28:47,661
he's a very lucky man.

381
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:50,641
Really.

382
00:29:09,502 --> 00:29:10,910
My father's dead.

383
00:29:17,842 --> 00:29:19,347
We'll get through.

384
00:29:53,465 --> 00:29:54,681
Get Gray back to town.

385
00:29:55,047 --> 00:29:56,340
What?
Wait a minute...

386
00:29:56,456 --> 00:29:58,744
Come tomorrow,
what's left of us will need a leader.

387
00:29:58,844 --> 00:30:01,363
I think we've lost enough
in that department for one day.

388
00:30:01,652 --> 00:30:03,321
We're gonna need
every set of hands we can get.

389
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:06,283
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You're too important now, Gray.

390
00:30:07,132 --> 00:30:09,119
It's not negotiable.
Get him an escort.

391
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:11,244
And start getting everyone
into position.

392
00:30:11,344 --> 00:30:13,643
Who knows when
they're gonna come back again?

393
00:32:26,396 --> 00:32:27,401
Go ahead.

394
00:32:27,518 --> 00:32:29,074
<i>So they got their reinforcements.

395
00:32:29,174 --> 00:32:30,603
<i>It's a couple hundred men.

396
00:32:31,009 --> 00:32:33,573
<i>And another six of those
deuce and a halfs.

397
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:36,413
<i>They're mobilizing now,
so I say you got about 15,

398
00:32:36,513 --> 00:32:38,738
<i>maybe 20 minutes
before they're on you.

399
00:32:41,469 --> 00:32:44,189
You get back here as soon as you can.
All right?

400
00:32:44,441 --> 00:32:46,063
Say, what do you know about
a set of train tracks

401
00:32:46,163 --> 00:32:47,523
running alongside the river?

402
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,212
Why?
What do you see?

403
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:52,005
<i>Hawkins, what's on the tracks?

404
00:32:52,105 --> 00:32:53,535
I don't know. I can't see.

405
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:57,683
- Hang on.
- Robert, disconnect it.

406
00:32:57,818 --> 00:33:00,155
Jake, you got a very large train
coming from New Bern,

407
00:33:00,255 --> 00:33:01,770
<i>and they've got three cargo cars.

408
00:33:01,963 --> 00:33:02,966
<i>What's in them?

409
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,203
I think it's men,
and there's hundreds of them.

410
00:33:06,303 --> 00:33:08,298
It's a whole set of reinforcement...

411
00:33:10,879 --> 00:33:12,982
Hawkins, what's going on?
Talk to me.

412
00:33:14,467 --> 00:33:15,625
<i>I'm on my way.

413
00:33:47,176 --> 00:33:48,430
I've got to go.

414
00:33:49,047 --> 00:33:50,051
Wait.

415
00:33:50,225 --> 00:33:51,765
Look, they only had a few seconds.

416
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:54,183
It wasn't enough time
to get an exact location.

417
00:33:54,354 --> 00:33:57,144
- We're fine for a little while.
- Where are you going?

418
00:33:58,514 --> 00:34:00,019
I have to stop a train.

419
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:06,013
I-80 is secured
from Cheyenne to Grand Island.

420
00:34:06,113 --> 00:34:09,675
We now control the area
between Kearney and Hastings.

421
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:12,441
I-70 is turning out to be a challenge.

422
00:34:12,854 --> 00:34:16,387
There are organized road gangs
controlling much of the interstate.

423
00:34:16,547 --> 00:34:19,200
I've also been told by a patient
in our medical unit

424
00:34:19,335 --> 00:34:22,738
to expect a significant skirmish
between two towns

425
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:26,648
in northwest Kansas:
New Bern and Jericho.

426
00:34:28,491 --> 00:34:30,824
<i>What is the location of those towns?

427
00:34:30,924 --> 00:34:33,005
CZ-12, Quadrant Four.

428
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:36,818
<i>We've tracked the terror suspect
to within 200 miles of that area.

429
00:34:37,068 --> 00:34:39,564
<i>Capture of this suspect
is a top priority

430
00:34:39,664 --> 00:34:41,736
<i>for President Tomarchio
and the administration.

431
00:34:41,836 --> 00:34:42,893
<i>Do you understand?

432
00:34:43,484 --> 00:34:46,103
- Should I re-prioritize, sir?
- <i>Immediately.

433
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,747
Go to Jericho and crush the skirmish.

434
00:34:49,075 --> 00:34:50,546
Once the area's clear,

435
00:34:50,681 --> 00:34:52,981
we will begin our search
for the terrorist.

436
00:35:10,546 --> 00:35:12,268
I'm gonna ask Mimi to marry me.

437
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,156
Yeah?

438
00:35:14,801 --> 00:35:16,583
Yeah. She can't cook,

439
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,445
she's never seen nine innings
of baseball in her life,

440
00:35:18,545 --> 00:35:19,782
she hates my clothes...

441
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,221
but I love her.

442
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:22,903
And I'm happy.

443
00:35:29,097 --> 00:35:30,879
Jake, I don't want to die today.

444
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:38,503
You're gonna make it out of here.

445
00:35:39,277 --> 00:35:40,750
That I promise.

446
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:57,547
Constantino and those trucks
are right on your doorstep.

447
00:35:57,737 --> 00:35:58,772
You don't have much time.

448
00:35:58,872 --> 00:35:59,955
What about that train?

449
00:36:00,055 --> 00:36:01,712
20 minutes, give or take.

450
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:05,643
Tell me you have a plan,
a really good one.

451
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,016
I need to borrow your tank.

452
00:36:16,183 --> 00:36:18,402
It won't fire.
I told you that, right?

453
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,502
There's not a single
round of ammo in it.

454
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:22,840
I'm not planning on shooting anything.

455
00:36:23,198 --> 00:36:24,704
The throttle's there on your left.

456
00:36:24,804 --> 00:36:26,506
And to steer, you're just gonna...

457
00:36:27,162 --> 00:36:28,891
Hey. This is not my first time.

458
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:41,930
Good luck out there.

459
00:36:46,426 --> 00:36:47,545
You, too.

460
00:36:58,948 --> 00:37:00,302
Any minute now, huh?

461
00:37:10,008 --> 00:37:11,016
I'm...

462
00:37:19,657 --> 00:37:21,124
You know, he's here...

463
00:37:21,683 --> 00:37:22,706
watching.

464
00:37:23,767 --> 00:37:25,214
You know that, right?

465
00:37:38,578 --> 00:37:40,841
They still doing
the bunny hop in there?

466
00:37:41,889 --> 00:37:43,362
I think it's the Macarena.

467
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,199
The what?

468
00:37:48,197 --> 00:37:50,421
Yeah, they're still doing the bunny hop.

469
00:37:54,197 --> 00:37:56,035
Quite a speech you made in there.

470
00:37:58,517 --> 00:38:01,130
I had no idea you were
such a sentimental fool.

471
00:38:03,118 --> 00:38:04,741
Mom wrote it.
You think?

472
00:38:10,867 --> 00:38:13,823
Listen, I know that you and Eric
aren't close and...

473
00:38:17,488 --> 00:38:21,242
maybe you didn't feel like standing up
in front of a bunch of people and...

474
00:38:21,387 --> 00:38:22,780
acting like you were.

475
00:38:26,257 --> 00:38:28,884
Sometimes doing what you feel like doing

476
00:38:28,984 --> 00:38:31,886
and doing what needs to be done
are two different things.

477
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:36,013
You don't have to worry about me, Dad.
I'm fine.

478
00:38:37,005 --> 00:38:40,581
I somehow get the feeling
my worrying days are far from over.

479
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:45,342
But they will be one day.

480
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:50,752
One day, I know you're gonna become
the man I know you can be,

481
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:53,044
the man you were born to be.

482
00:38:56,477 --> 00:38:59,036
My God, that day's gonna be
something to see.

483
00:39:04,428 --> 00:39:05,733
Come on, Johnston.

484
00:39:05,919 --> 00:39:08,012
This scotch ain't gonna drink itself.

485
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:12,795
Me and the old man are gonna
head down to the lake

486
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,987
and share some 30-year-old single malt.
You want to come?

487
00:39:19,447 --> 00:39:20,962
Yeah. I'm just gonna...

488
00:39:21,495 --> 00:39:23,212
wait for Emily, say good night.

489
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:25,153
I'll...

490
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:26,832
meet you there.

491
00:39:27,936 --> 00:39:29,389
I'll save you a place.

492
00:39:34,091 --> 00:39:36,704
- Where's he going?
- Waiting for Emily, say good night.

493
00:39:37,934 --> 00:39:39,843
That's the last we'll see
of him tonight.

494
00:39:39,943 --> 00:39:40,943
Dad...

495
00:39:41,736 --> 00:39:43,433
If I had a girl that looked like that,

496
00:39:43,533 --> 00:39:45,057
I wouldn't keep her waiting.

497
00:39:46,058 --> 00:39:47,332
You hear that, boy?

498
00:39:47,697 --> 00:39:49,729
I'm gonna take that girl
away from you.

499
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,893
You talk a good game.

500
00:39:51,993 --> 00:39:54,124
You better watch out
for yourself, too.

501
00:39:54,224 --> 00:39:55,803
Your wife is crazy about me.

502
00:39:55,903 --> 00:39:59,350
Oh, my wife wants to take a hickory
switch to you three times a day.

503
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:02,863
It's Constantino.

504
00:40:11,723 --> 00:40:12,843
I'm here.

505
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,756
<i>My scouts just informed me.

506
00:40:15,615 --> 00:40:17,523
<i>I am sorry about your father.

507
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:23,992
You're outmanned,
and you're outgunned.

508
00:40:24,348 --> 00:40:27,173
There's too many of us and
we are too desperate to give up.

509
00:40:27,273 --> 00:40:28,606
You cannot win this.

510
00:40:29,884 --> 00:40:31,891
I'm giving you one last chance.

511
00:40:33,028 --> 00:40:33,895
<i>Walk away,
put your guns down...

512
00:40:33,896 --> 00:40:35,188
Walk away,
put your guns down...

513
00:40:35,323 --> 00:40:36,545
and return to town,

514
00:40:36,841 --> 00:40:38,577
and no one else will be harmed.

515
00:40:41,755 --> 00:40:44,202
Jake, I need an answer.
What's it gonna be?

516
00:40:48,227 --> 00:40:49,234
Nuts.

517
00:40:51,521 --> 00:40:52,929
Sorry, I didn't get that.

518
00:40:53,749 --> 00:40:55,592
You can go straight to hell.

519
00:41:00,476 --> 00:41:01,981
About my father...

520
00:41:04,067 --> 00:41:06,061
you're the one I'm coming for.

521
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:13,563
I want to go home.

522
00:41:13,717 --> 00:41:15,965
Our orders are to take people
out of the conflict zone.

523
00:41:16,065 --> 00:41:17,609
You'll be safer in Cheyenne.

524
00:41:18,216 --> 00:41:19,410
Colonel Hoffman?

525
00:41:20,406 --> 00:41:21,415
What is all this?

526
00:41:21,515 --> 00:41:24,010
- Sir, wheels up in five minutes.
- Roger that.

527
00:41:24,288 --> 00:41:27,473
- Jericho's been moved up to priority #1
on the list.  - Thank you.

528
00:41:27,573 --> 00:41:28,772
Oh, God, thank you.

529
00:41:29,097 --> 00:41:30,405
This is all thanks to you.

530
00:41:30,505 --> 00:41:33,182
Don't worry. We're gonna get things
back to normal again.

531
00:41:33,468 --> 00:41:34,626
All right, saddle up.

532
00:42:02,447 --> 00:42:05,372
My father expected us
to make a stand here.

533
00:42:09,185 --> 00:42:10,661
To defend our home.

534
00:42:14,877 --> 00:42:16,380
That's what we're gonna do.

535
00:42:32,995 --> 00:42:34,045
Smoke bombs!

536
00:42:34,145 --> 00:42:35,380
Get in position!

537
00:42:42,295 --> 00:42:43,933
Don't waste your rounds!

538
00:42:44,947 --> 00:42:46,771
Wait for a clean shot!

539
00:42:52,759 --> 00:42:53,762
Wait...

540
00:43:07,807 --> 00:43:08,810
Wait...

541
00:43:13,644 --> 00:43:14,647
Wait...

542
00:43:20,258 --> 00:43:21,570
Now!
