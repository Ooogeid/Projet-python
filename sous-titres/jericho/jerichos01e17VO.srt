00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,500
<i>Previously on</i> Jericho

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,100
Some of them were on planes

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,700
that landed in the middle of nowhere.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,500
They've been walking for weeks.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,600
They must have gone through hell.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Oh, my God.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,900
At the current levels of consumption,

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,299
we will be completely
out of gas and diesel in two weeks.

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,299
There's a woman in that
group of refugees that

10
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,500
Bill is processing.
I think you should talk to her.

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,100
Hello, Rob.

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,399
Someone on my team sold us all out.

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,499
You're smart enough to know

14
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,900
that they would say anything
to get you to talk, Sarah.

15
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,900
Get the package.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,600
We're the United States Marines,

17
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,000
and we're here to help.

18
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,999
... and those are to restore lights,

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,400
power and infrastructure
to Kansas, one town at a time.

20
00:00:57,699 --> 00:00:59,899
Something's wrong about all this,
all right? Trust me.

21
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,041
They've got somebody on the edge of town
pretending to be their headquarters.

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,500
Is any of this real?

23
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,899
- The gun's real.
- Hands up. Get them up!

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,400
What the hell do we do with them?

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,400
You will leave your weapons on the tank,

26
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,900
and you will move out!

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,600
- What do we do with that?
- Stanley,

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
got room in your barn?

29
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,900
- Seriously?
- Why not?

30
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,900
Never know when you might need a tank.

31
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,800
You're making too much noise.

32
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,000
Sorry.

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
Where did it go?

34
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,500
There it is.

35
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,400
- It's locked.
- We shouldn't go in.

36
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Go in here.

37
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,600
- Why do I have to?
- So we can eat.

38
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
You see it?

39
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,900
Katie?

40
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,000
<i>Come on, Jake,
there's a line here.

41
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,400
<i>Did you hear about the tank?

42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,000
<i>Those Marines coming or what?

43
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,900
<i>Everybody, just calm down!
You'll get your share.

44
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,300
<i>You'll get your rations!

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,800
<i>People, please, back up!

46
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,500
How is Gray handling this?

47
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:57,599
You better get in there.

48
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
I think we really screwed
ourselves this time.

49
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,999
You said everyone in the shelter gets
half-rations until the Marines come.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,500
Well, the Marines aren't coming,
and you've known all along.

51
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,400
We did the best that we could.

52
00:03:07,473 --> 00:03:09,399
People had to believe
that help was on the way.

53
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,499
And you know what?

54
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,600
Half-rations is a lot more than
those refugees had before they got here.

55
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,400
Did you know about this?

56
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,400
The Marines...
That they were con artists?

57
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,100
Yeah, but we didn't give them
any of our supplies.

58
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,100
And Gray is right. The last thing
this town needs is to lose hope.

59
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,600
Hope won't keep
my friends from starving.

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,200
I've got one woman too weak to walk.

61
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,700
It's a mathematical problem.

62
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,299
We've got your friends,
plus another 50 who migrated here.

63
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,300
That's too many people,
and not enough food.

64
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,850
We'll just have to figure out
how to make what we have last.

65
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,400
I say the first thing we do,

66
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,300
is stop giving it away to strangers.

67
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,000
What if we cut
the food rations in half,

68
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,300
again?

69
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:33,499
It's more than the food.
What about medicine?

70
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,716
Those refugees came here sick.

71
00:04:34,749 --> 00:04:36,799
They've been burning through
our meds for a month.

72
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,600
Can we make it to spring, Harry?

73
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,600
Some of us can. Not all.

74
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,400
Crime's been going up
since they got here.

75
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,199
Crime's been going up
since the bombs.

76
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,700
It's got to be done.
The numbers speak for themselves.

77
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,599
Just look at 'em.

78
00:04:48,632 --> 00:04:50,800
I don't need to look at 'em.
I see them in my sleep.

79
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,700
What are you going to do?

80
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
Folks?

81
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,300
Folks, listen up!

82
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,199
I am sorry to say that

83
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,500
the town no longer has the resources
to take care of you.

84
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,500
<i>What?
Where are we supposed to go?

85
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,999
So if you could please
gather up your belongings,

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,399
you will be escorted
to a FEMA camp out

87
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,900
- near I-70.
- We've been to those FEMA camps.

88
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,500
We barely made it out
alive the first time.

89
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,700
FEMA has medicine and supplies,
and we don't.

90
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,400
You heard the mayor.

91
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,500
You need to start packing up.

92
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,900
What are you going to do,
put us in jail?

93
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,100
Great.

94
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,100
If I didn't have to do this,

95
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,500
- I wouldn't.
- We've been working!

96
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,900
Okay? We've been chopping wood!

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,400
Jessica's been helping you
with your medical center.

98
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,000
But if you put us out on the...

100
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,100
This isn't a debate.

101
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
You're right.

102
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,300
'Cause we're staying.

107
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,900
Anything?

108
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,200
Static.

109
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:20,699
No news.

110
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,599
I guess now the secret
about the tank is out,

111
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,999
there's no need to hide the radio.

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,300
Yeah. I'll take it down
to Bailey's later.

113
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,900
We can all be annoyed together.

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Emily.

115
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,699
Gray's trying to kick out the refugees.

116
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,548
They barricaded themselves
inside the church.

117
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:38,800
Was anybody hurt?

118
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,199
Is there another door?

119
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,600
No. They blocked that one, too.

120
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,100
Look, Roger, I'm sorry, but...

121
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,349
You lie about the Marines,

122
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,799
you get caught, you need someone
to blame, so you pick them.

123
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,399
We have taken in almost
a hundred people since the bombs.

124
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,100
Roger, you brought over 50 yourself.

125
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,400
We've done our part.

126
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
It's time for somebody else
to share the burden.

127
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,500
- Now, these FEMA camps...
- Those FEMA camps are jungles.

128
00:07:04,673 --> 00:07:06,999
Putting anybody out on those streets
is a death sentence.

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,100
You've been out there.
You know that.

130
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,099
Look, it comes down to ressources.

131
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,232
All right? And people of Jericho
have to come first.

132
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,916
It's 100 of them or 100 of us.

133
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,100
Let me work on Gray.

134
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,800
You and Emily try and talk
some sense into the refugees.

135
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Don't give Gray
a reason to make this worse.

136
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,850
All right? Gray can't send
these people away like this.

137
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,900
It's his call.

138
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,300
Well, isn't there
something we can do?

139
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,799
Give them warm clothing for the trip.

140
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,700
We've given away
everything we can spare.

141
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,300
Well, there's...

142
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
What?

143
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
April's things?

144
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,700
Kyle, what are you doing?

145
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,399
We're not leaving here without a fight.

146
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
- This is a bad idea.
- What should we do?

147
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,000
We take down the barricade.

148
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,099
We go out unarmed.
We look them in the eye,

149
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,099
and we ask them to stay
till the end of winter.

150
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,200
Look them in the eye.

151
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
That's your plan?

152
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,200
- You don't know this town.
- Apparently, that makes two of us.

153
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,100
Where did you get the food from?

154
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,600
You stole it.

155
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,699
You broke into people's houses?

156
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,099
It's not like you didn't do the same
thing when we were out there.

157
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,499
Yeah, well, this is different.
This town took care of us!

158
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,000
We took care of us!

159
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,100
Because we knew,
one day, this town wouldn't.

160
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,100
What do you see?

161
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,700
Looks like Simmons has got
his nephew guarding the shed.

162
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,300
I don't think I can get in.

163
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,700
You have to.

164
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,400
You traded them for that gas,
and they're holding out on you.

165
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,800
You can't let these farmers
get away with it anymore.

166
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,000
It's easy for you to say.

167
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
I'll go this time.

168
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Very funny.

169
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,000
What? You think you're
the only badass here?

170
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,500
- Uh... yeah.
- You want to bet?

171
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,000
Forget it, Skylar. Simmons is not
a pushover like Frederickson.

172
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,300
Neither am I.

173
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

174
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
You could get hurt.

175
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,400
You're worried about me?

176
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,200
That's so sweet.

177
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,100
Now, watch and learn.

178
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Found them!

179
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,799
Tear gas?

180
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,815
Gray, those things been
sitting around for years.

181
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:03,500
You can't do this, Gray.
I've given these people sanctuary.

182
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:05,099
Reverend, this is a police matter now.

183
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,799
You have no right
to assault these people.

184
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,899
They've committed no crimes.

185
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,699
- They'll be my responsibility.
- What, are you going to feed them?

186
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,000
What, you got a little hospital
down there, Reverend?

187
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,600
No, I didn't think so.

188
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,300
What's that sound?

189
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,900
They're boarding up the windows.

190
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,999
There were half a dozen other places
we could have stopped,

191
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,500
but you kept talking like Jericho
was the end of the freakin' rainbow.

192
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,800
So we kept walking...
losing people... for this.

193
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,899
Out of my way, Johnston!
I know what I'm doing.

194
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,300
You know why we never used those?
A little thing called Waco happened.

195
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,400
The FBI used tear gas,

196
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,099
and they swear it didn't start
that fire, but it could have.

197
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,631
- You ready to live with that?
- Dad!

198
00:10:46,632 --> 00:10:48,200
We can't hold off a town.

199
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,899
- It's too big a gamble.
- It's not a gamble for you!

200
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,199
You get to go home
to a warm bed every night.

201
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,000
I told you... I'm with you.

202
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,300
What happens when
we get kicked out of this town?

203
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,500
<i>Come on!

204
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,400
What are you doing?
Get out of the way!

205
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,000
<i>She's got no pulse.

206
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,900
Hank! Hank!

207
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,599
- Skylar!
- Thank God. There are men on the road!

208
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,400
- Men? What men?
- They're with Ravenwood.

209
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,700
Is your uncle here?

210
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,099
- No, it's just me.
- We have to hide!

211
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,700
Okay, yeah. Come on!

212
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,500
How many were there?

213
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,900
I don't know. Five, maybe six.

214
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,100
I can't see them.

215
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:18,366
You know what?

216
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,600
I bet you have
a better view from the hayloft.

217
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,200
- I'm right behind you.
- Okay.

218
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Skylar!

219
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Stop!

220
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,200
It's okay. I'll wait.

221
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,999
One of the refugees is still out there.

222
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,899
You have the rangers search the barns.

223
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,100
Use dogs if it'll help.

224
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,900
And the rest of them?

225
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,700
Take them to the med center,
get them fixed up, Harry.

226
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,900
Then send them away.

227
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,600
What about the extra food
you promised them?

228
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,099
Give it to them.

229
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,500
- After what they did to us?
- Will you just do it,

230
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,500
before somebody else gets hurt?!

231
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,900
It's not too late.

232
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,899
Just let them stay until spring.

233
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,700
You think I haven't tried
to make that work?

234
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,100
The numbers don't add up.

235
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,400
- They're good people, Gray. Just...
- And?!

236
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Good people are dying every day!

237
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,899
Someone finally has to tell the truth.

238
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,300
It's musical chairs out there.
The music has stopped!

239
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,700
Oh, my God!

240
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,499
Oh, my God, get away from me!

241
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,600
Get away from me!

242
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,399
A hundred counts of murder, Gray.

243
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,999
That's what they should charge you with
if you send them away.

244
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,799
We have been feeding them
and we have been heating the shelter.

245
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,599
We've been taking
from my friends

246
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,400
to give to strangers,
so don't you dare lecture me!

247
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,300
Whatever happens to them is on you!

248
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,399
Let me go, please!

249
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,300
- I don't want to hurt you!
- Just let me go, please!

250
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,699
You're not leaving
until this is resolved!

251
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,500
This is resolved!
Get out of my way!

252
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,100
- They're not going anywhere.
- You want to bet?

253
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,500
Just take whatever you want!
Just get out!

254
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,400
And go where?!

255
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,900
I got the entire police force
guarding the refugees,

256
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,500
and one way or another,
they're going.

257
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,500
Hey, stop it!

258
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,100
All right, stop it!

259
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,300
What's going on?
What happened?

260
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,699
Gray pulled a gun.
It was an accident.

261
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,900
Like hell! He shot me!

262
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,699
There's so much blood.

263
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,999
He needs a doctor.

264
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,599
- Get-get Kenchy.
- No, get Jessica.

265
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,199
Shut up!
You're not running things!

266
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Get Jessica, please, all right?
I trust her.

267
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,400
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

268
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,900
What are you looking for?

269
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,300
Superglue.

270
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,500
The sole on my boot came apart
after a couple hundred miles.

271
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,100
My son's shoes might fit you.

272
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,700
I'd rather fix these.

273
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,300
Why?

274
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
They're all I have left that are mine.

275
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,000
Where are you going to go?

276
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,000
I don't know really.

277
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,500
My family was in Chicago.

278
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,299
I wish there was more
that we could do.

279
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,500
Ma'am,

280
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,999
there are empty houses
all over Jericho,

281
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,800
and we sleep in a shelter.

282
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,500
Those are our neighbors' homes.

283
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,899
They were gone
when the bombs went off.

284
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,600
They're coming back.

285
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,100
Well, wherever your neighbors are,

286
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,900
I hope nobody's kicking them
out of town in the middle of winter.

287
00:20:39,564 --> 00:20:41,205
What the hell happened in there?

288
00:20:41,244 --> 00:20:42,775
- Gray's bleeding badly.
- I'm busy.

289
00:20:42,776 --> 00:20:44,450
- I need your help!
- Get Kenchy.

290
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:46,484
Look, you're the only
one Roger trusts.

291
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:48,534
You want me to save
Gray Anderson?

292
00:20:48,885 --> 00:20:50,559
If Gray dies, so does Roger.

293
00:20:50,778 --> 00:20:52,906
People aren't just going
to let it go. Please?

294
00:21:01,514 --> 00:21:02,860
We can all get out of this.

295
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,393
I was just trying to help them.

296
00:21:04,424 --> 00:21:06,724
Now... there's no way the
town lets them stay.

297
00:21:06,818 --> 00:21:08,727
It was an accident.
I saw it.

298
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:10,526
Gray...

299
00:21:10,948 --> 00:21:12,095
just until spring.

300
00:21:12,345 --> 00:21:13,472
That's all I ask.

301
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:15,470
Come on!

302
00:21:16,612 --> 00:21:17,612
You were right.

303
00:21:17,665 --> 00:21:18,744
This is on me.

304
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:19,949
I brought them here.

305
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:21,137
I did it...

306
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,062
I did it for my own reasons.

307
00:21:23,812 --> 00:21:25,033
But don't punish them,

308
00:21:25,486 --> 00:21:26,491
I'm begging you.

309
00:21:27,027 --> 00:21:28,153
Just till spring.

310
00:21:28,936 --> 00:21:29,949
Go to hell.

311
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,256
I've got Jessica. Let us in.

312
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,670
You need to let me look at him.

313
00:21:41,952 --> 00:21:43,626
You give them a chance...

314
00:21:44,518 --> 00:21:45,629
...I'll give you a chance.

315
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:48,288
I was going to give you
food, an escort.

316
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,962
We wouldn't survive out there...

317
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:52,011
you know that.
We have to stay here.

318
00:21:52,856 --> 00:21:54,655
Why would you die over this?!

319
00:21:56,642 --> 00:21:58,175
He's our only leverage.

320
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,421
Roger, this isn't you.

321
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:03,644
I survived out there
for three months.

322
00:22:03,816 --> 00:22:07,180
You have no idea what
I can do if I have to.

323
00:22:58,851 --> 00:23:00,556
- Any sign of her?
- No.

324
00:23:01,745 --> 00:23:03,098
Check the buildings.

325
00:23:03,396 --> 00:23:05,742
She's got to be around
here somewhere.

326
00:23:22,748 --> 00:23:23,749
Hold up.

327
00:23:23,796 --> 00:23:25,580
She changed the location again.

328
00:23:25,611 --> 00:23:27,207
Meet you back at the road.

329
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,268
Bill, don't!

330
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:10,764
You think I want to?

331
00:24:10,836 --> 00:24:13,556
Roger's a friend of mine, but I can't
let the mayor bleed to death.

332
00:24:13,572 --> 00:24:15,825
What if you miss?
What if you hit Emily?

333
00:24:15,966 --> 00:24:17,123
Get off me.

334
00:24:17,593 --> 00:24:19,916
If I get the shot, Jake...
I'm taking it.

335
00:24:20,405 --> 00:24:21,422
Damn it.

336
00:24:26,969 --> 00:24:28,534
We have to get him help.

337
00:24:28,581 --> 00:24:29,911
He didn't want to do this.

338
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,929
It doesn't matter what
we want, does it?

339
00:24:32,007 --> 00:24:33,384
It matters what we do.

340
00:24:33,963 --> 00:24:35,918
I tried to get us all back here.

341
00:24:36,403 --> 00:24:39,188
I promised them if we
just stuck together.

342
00:24:39,555 --> 00:24:41,135
- And you did.
- Yeah.

343
00:24:41,745 --> 00:24:43,639
Emily, most of us made it back.

344
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,157
19 of us didn't.

345
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,421
What's going on?

346
00:24:57,987 --> 00:25:00,944
And I remember...
every one of their faces.

347
00:25:11,268 --> 00:25:12,950
- Get away from the window!
- Jake, what are you doing?!

348
00:25:12,977 --> 00:25:15,156
- I told you to stay out!
- Get away from the window!

349
00:25:15,308 --> 00:25:16,873
Get away from the window!

350
00:25:17,522 --> 00:25:19,274
Roger, get away from
the window!

351
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:22,865
Roger, get away from
the window!

352
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,415
If you want your friends to live...

353
00:25:42,572 --> 00:25:45,403
you better back the hell off
right now and listen to me!

354
00:25:45,873 --> 00:25:47,171
Roger, he's here to help.

355
00:25:47,234 --> 00:25:48,345
I'm listening.

356
00:25:49,405 --> 00:25:51,455
What if we give you
transportation?

357
00:25:51,939 --> 00:25:53,363
And food and fuel?

358
00:25:54,036 --> 00:25:55,491
So we can die out there?

359
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,290
- Guy is that what you think about?
- No!

360
00:25:57,369 --> 00:25:59,293
You can make it to
the migration trail.

361
00:25:59,418 --> 00:26:00,732
Head south and beat the winter.

362
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,508
It's not your decision to make.

363
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:04,401
Won't be yours either if you're dead.

364
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,732
You can't keep us in here forever.

365
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:08,140
This will end.

366
00:26:08,194 --> 00:26:10,431
And when it does,
you can forget about staying.

367
00:26:10,432 --> 00:26:12,215
They will kick you out
with nothing.

368
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:22,845
I'm going to need guns.

369
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,378
I can't give you guns.

370
00:26:24,425 --> 00:26:27,069
I can't protect a hundred
people with what I have.

371
00:26:29,515 --> 00:26:31,877
But you let Jessica take Gray
to the medical center.

372
00:26:32,018 --> 00:26:33,223
He's not leaving.

373
00:26:33,348 --> 00:26:37,009
Roger, if that bullet is still in him,
I'm going to have to open him up.

374
00:26:40,718 --> 00:26:41,829
Is it a deal?

375
00:26:49,793 --> 00:26:51,835
You make sure everything's ready.

376
00:26:52,414 --> 00:26:53,509
I'll let him go.

377
00:27:11,366 --> 00:27:12,446
Hey, Allie.

378
00:27:13,338 --> 00:27:14,574
Dad, you can't be around here.

379
00:27:14,575 --> 00:27:15,731
Mom will freak out.

380
00:27:15,747 --> 00:27:17,640
I won't stay long.
Come on.

381
00:27:26,957 --> 00:27:28,005
So...

382
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:31,588
I just wanted to know
how you were doing.

383
00:27:32,806 --> 00:27:35,278
Settling in okay at
Jimmy's place?

384
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,454
- Yeah, he just never stops talking.
- No...

385
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,192
He doesn't.

386
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:46,230
ow's Sam?

387
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,594
You know, he gets scared.

388
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:51,362
And you?

389
00:27:52,082 --> 00:27:53,083
I'm fine.

390
00:27:54,144 --> 00:27:55,146
Look...

391
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:58,697
that thing you had
to do to Sarah...

392
00:27:59,918 --> 00:28:01,905
I know how that can
change people.

393
00:28:02,249 --> 00:28:03,250
Dad...

394
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:04,423
don't worry about me.

395
00:28:05,521 --> 00:28:07,562
I'm not Sam, and
I'm not Mom.

396
00:28:10,738 --> 00:28:11,818
So...

397
00:28:12,728 --> 00:28:15,450
you're not going to live with
us anymore... are you ?

398
00:28:15,873 --> 00:28:18,016
I don't think it's a good
idea right now.

399
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:23,589
Then don't worry.

400
00:28:24,011 --> 00:28:25,435
I'll take care of them.

401
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:27,000
Come here.

402
00:28:30,551 --> 00:28:31,850
You are not me.

403
00:28:57,963 --> 00:28:59,387
Thank you for helping me.

404
00:28:59,434 --> 00:29:00,874
Just try to keep still.

405
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,256
It's my job, you know.

406
00:29:07,151 --> 00:29:08,434
I didn't want to do it.

407
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,061
I had to.

408
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:13,331
We all have our jobs to do,
whether we want to do them or not.

409
00:29:17,096 --> 00:29:18,410
Just hang on.

410
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:39,704
The bus is here.

411
00:29:44,836 --> 00:29:46,557
When do you think you'll come back?

412
00:29:46,604 --> 00:29:47,715
After this...

413
00:29:48,873 --> 00:29:51,001
he's never going to
let me come back.

414
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:56,258
Maybe I shouldn't have
brought them here.

415
00:29:56,367 --> 00:29:57,869
There were other places...

416
00:29:58,166 --> 00:29:59,168
camps...

417
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:00,889
towns we heard about.

418
00:30:03,681 --> 00:30:05,042
But I had to see you.

419
00:30:10,484 --> 00:30:11,939
A refugee broke into the house.

420
00:30:11,971 --> 00:30:13,316
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

421
00:30:13,332 --> 00:30:14,474
I'll get the guys.

422
00:30:14,693 --> 00:30:15,741
Listen to me.

423
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:17,603
We can't let this happen.

424
00:30:19,621 --> 00:30:20,716
We're ready.

425
00:30:25,738 --> 00:30:26,740
Get up.

426
00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:30,217
Wait, you can't take him.

427
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:32,282
Once my friends and I...

428
00:30:32,454 --> 00:30:34,019
are safely out of town...

429
00:30:34,135 --> 00:30:35,135
I'll let him go.

430
00:30:35,161 --> 00:30:36,929
He'll be dead by then.

431
00:30:38,932 --> 00:30:41,553
You can't let them go out there.

432
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:45,714
A woman died on Main Street today.

433
00:30:46,183 --> 00:30:48,483
I didn't even know her name.

434
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:49,670
Did you?

435
00:30:50,335 --> 00:30:53,073
If you need a hostage,
take me.

436
00:30:54,262 --> 00:30:56,702
Think of our neighbors who
haven't made it back yet.

437
00:30:56,765 --> 00:30:58,674
That's who they are.

438
00:30:59,808 --> 00:31:01,418
Now my family can feed two people.

439
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:03,453
Now my family can feed two people.

440
00:31:04,108 --> 00:31:06,893
Who else here is willing
to share their rations?

441
00:31:08,645 --> 00:31:09,881
They're coming out!

442
00:31:14,395 --> 00:31:15,803
All right, move back!

443
00:31:17,055 --> 00:31:18,228
Move back!

444
00:31:18,546 --> 00:31:19,839
Come on, people, we can do this.

445
00:31:19,871 --> 00:31:21,091
I know we can, please.

446
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,830
Thank you, Bob. Yeah.

447
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:27,193
Right. Good.
Who else?

448
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:29,759
Come on, who else? Please.

449
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:31,386
Please.

450
00:31:31,754 --> 00:31:33,130
Everybody, get back!

451
00:31:35,321 --> 00:31:36,322
Get back!

452
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:38,467
Keep your guns down.

453
00:31:39,202 --> 00:31:40,204
Keep them down.

454
00:31:43,489 --> 00:31:44,944
Move back!
Move back!

455
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,421
- Move back!
- My God.

456
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,838
Roger...

457
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,757
it's over.

458
00:31:57,468 --> 00:31:58,876
They can stay.

459
00:32:00,347 --> 00:32:01,990
We found them homes.

460
00:32:02,913 --> 00:32:04,821
Just put the gun down, Roger.

461
00:32:05,385 --> 00:32:06,394
You won.

462
00:32:06,422 --> 00:32:07,791
Come on, put it down.

463
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:42,105
How's the mayor?

464
00:32:43,794 --> 00:32:46,219
Jessica did a great job.
He's, um...

465
00:32:47,017 --> 00:32:49,693
he's lost a lot of blood,
but he's stable.

466
00:32:53,114 --> 00:32:55,492
We talked him into letting
the others stay.

467
00:32:59,443 --> 00:33:00,460
But, um...

468
00:33:02,478 --> 00:33:03,479
Not me.

469
00:33:14,364 --> 00:33:15,428
Well...

470
00:33:17,172 --> 00:33:18,987
I'd say I'd call you, but...

471
00:33:31,328 --> 00:33:32,829
I'm coming with you.

472
00:33:33,189 --> 00:33:34,347
No, you're not.

473
00:33:34,457 --> 00:33:36,084
Roger, I-I am, so...

474
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:38,274
I did this

475
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,889
so the people I love
can be safe here.

476
00:33:41,781 --> 00:33:45,191
I'm not taking the person I love
the most out on those roads.

477
00:33:45,755 --> 00:33:47,131
I can handle it.

478
00:33:48,954 --> 00:33:50,065
I can't.

479
00:34:22,224 --> 00:34:24,273
So... what do you think?

480
00:34:24,445 --> 00:34:27,199
Well, it's no Saks Fifth Avenue,
but...

481
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:29,014
it's pretty great.

482
00:34:29,483 --> 00:34:31,188
Thanks to all the deals we made,

483
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,096
we have a real trading post now.

484
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:41,873
Hi, Mr. Simmons.

485
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,141
Hank.
- What?!

486
00:34:44,235 --> 00:34:47,098
You think this is a joke?
I could've shot you.

487
00:34:47,198 --> 00:34:49,247
Talk to your uncle, Hank.
He's the one that broke the deal.

488
00:34:49,248 --> 00:34:51,234
You're just a real big man,
aren't you?

489
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:55,052
Just give me my horse
and the gas, and I'll be on my way.

490
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:58,170
The horse is tied up in the alley,
but the gas is mine.

491
00:34:58,201 --> 00:34:59,734
I'm through playing
games with you.

492
00:34:59,844 --> 00:35:01,064
Hank, get the gas.

493
00:35:11,857 --> 00:35:13,344
Meet my new employees.

494
00:35:39,744 --> 00:35:42,607
This is, um,
Jim and Judy Moore's house.

495
00:35:43,187 --> 00:35:45,542
They were visiting their grandchildren

496
00:35:46,699 --> 00:35:48,588
just outside of Philadelphia.

497
00:35:54,841 --> 00:35:57,054
Rations are on Tuesday.

498
00:35:57,582 --> 00:35:59,998
We'll be by to share them with you.

499
00:36:06,191 --> 00:36:07,876
Mrs. Green.

500
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:12,039
Thank you.

501
00:38:01,089 --> 00:38:03,890
We got together
some canned food and water.

502
00:38:04,581 --> 00:38:06,327
I wish I had more.

503
00:38:18,222 --> 00:38:20,049
Nothing I say is going to...

504
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,404
is going to sound right, so...

505
00:38:23,907 --> 00:38:25,876
Are you really sad to see me go?

506
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:29,084
It's not about that.

507
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:31,344
Here.

508
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,129
Take Cedar Run first, it's clear,

509
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,733
and then head to New Bern.

510
00:38:43,485 --> 00:38:45,189
Heather, Stanley, my brother,

511
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,875
they can help you
once you're there.

512
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,067
I know my way around.

513
00:40:08,733 --> 00:40:12,133
<i>Bodies were found

514

00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:17,310

00:40:17,311 --> 00:40:19,762
Wait, I've heard that voice before.

517
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:22,999
Oh, yeah, that's the guy that does
the farm report. It's real news.

518
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:24,961
<i>... to research laboratories.

Jimmy, what is it?
