00:00:00,729 --> 00:00:02,502
<i>Previously on Jericho...</i>

2
00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:07,115
<i>Bonnie's dead.</i>

3
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:08,943
<i>Goetz is off limits.</i>

4
00:00:09,456 --> 00:00:12,031
No threats, no retribution,
<i>no exceptions.</i>

5
00:00:12,305 --> 00:00:13,180
Stanley!

6
00:00:15,326 --> 00:00:17,038
I'm declaring Jericho to be

7
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:18,815
<i>an open insurrection.</i>

8
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:21,353
<i>Western states have
all fallen in with Cheyenne.</i>

9
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,605
<i>Texans are getting close
to siding with Cheyenne.</i>

10
00:00:23,665 --> 00:00:25,320
If that happens, it's a <i>ball game.</i>

11
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:26,706
I have one of the bombs.

12
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,565
<i>That bomb is the key
to bringing down this Government.</i>

13
00:00:29,636 --> 00:00:33,047
- <i>They'll never let you get it to Texas.</i>
- Okay, John Smith.

14
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:38,951
<i>We found a package.</i>

15
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:41,042
<i>You're not just
some</i> innocent whistle-blower.

16
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:42,743
<i>The last time I blew the whistle,</i>

17
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:44,860
<i>I took out 23 American cities.</i>

18
00:00:44,965 --> 00:00:46,622
<i>The man behind</i>
the September attacks

19
00:00:46,705 --> 00:00:50,252
<i>is pretty confident that he can
use it</i> to destroy the city of Cheyenne.

20
00:00:50,347 --> 00:00:51,653
When do we leave?

21
00:00:56,495 --> 00:00:58,980
<i>Mary arranged for us
to meet one of</i> her runners

22
00:00:59,087 --> 00:01:01,372
this side of the checkpoint
on Route 309.

23
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:03,623
He should be able to
get us through to Wyoming.

24
00:01:03,706 --> 00:01:05,812
Hopefully just outside
of Cheyenne.

25
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:07,631
We're on our own from there.

26
00:01:07,717 --> 00:01:10,311
The streets are going to be crawling
with soldiers from Cheyenne

27
00:01:10,358 --> 00:01:13,263
and mercenaries from
Ravenwood on police patrol.

28
00:01:13,548 --> 00:01:15,733
And as I am enemy number
one right now,

29
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:18,013
we're going to need
someplace safe fast.

30
00:01:18,117 --> 00:01:20,452
- What about your contact there?
- Who, Cheung?

31
00:01:20,555 --> 00:01:21,351
Yeah.

32
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:24,462
I got a lead on his location, but
it might take awhile to track him down.

33
00:01:25,187 --> 00:01:27,461
We're going to need
something more immediate.

34
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:30,323
- Look, Jake.
- Yeah.

35
00:01:30,398 --> 00:01:32,570
When we get out there,
the mission is everything.

36
00:01:33,448 --> 00:01:35,990
- Yeah, I get it.
- No, no, see...

37
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:37,643
I got to be sure.

38
00:01:38,388 --> 00:01:40,951
I'm asking for your help,
but I can't afford for you to go off

39
00:01:40,995 --> 00:01:43,170
book out there and I don't
have any room for debate,

40
00:01:43,215 --> 00:01:45,831
so if you've got any questions,
now's the time.

41
00:01:46,218 --> 00:01:48,040
- Yeah, I've got a question.
- Go ahead.

42
00:01:48,105 --> 00:01:49,792
How are we going to find the bomb?

43
00:01:49,928 --> 00:01:51,382
No idea. Anything else?

44
00:01:55,677 --> 00:01:58,092
<i>Insurgent activity
in your piece of the world</i>

45
00:01:58,178 --> 00:02:00,141
<i>has reached
unacceptable levels, Major.</i>

46
00:02:00,226 --> 00:02:02,511
<i>The Cheyenne government
will not tolerate this.</i>

47
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:05,230
<i>Your orders are to begin
Phase Three operations immediately.</i>

48
00:02:05,555 --> 00:02:06,550
Sir,

49
00:02:06,685 --> 00:02:08,253
with all due respect,

50
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:10,381
I believe it's premature
to move to phase three.

51
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:12,070
This place is still salvageable.

52
00:02:12,145 --> 00:02:14,443
<i>Two prisoners escaped
your custody yesterday.</i>

53
00:02:14,515 --> 00:02:18,243
<i>You've lost three supply convoys
through raiding parties the past week.</i>

54
00:02:18,428 --> 00:02:20,072
<i>The time for restraint has passed.</i>

55
00:02:20,155 --> 00:02:21,320
<i>You have your orders.</i>

56
00:02:21,365 --> 00:02:23,382
<i>This insurrection must end.</i>

57
00:02:34,926 --> 00:02:36,581
20-minute orientation,

58
00:02:36,738 --> 00:02:39,502
an hour roundtable discussion,
<i>two hours for lunch?</i>

59
00:02:39,595 --> 00:02:41,652
A thousand person
town hall meeting and boom,

60
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,240
the Second Amendment's gone.

61
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:45,402
It's a lot easier
to pacify a country

62
00:02:45,447 --> 00:02:47,622
when its citizens can't shoot back.

63
00:02:47,728 --> 00:02:49,642
I'm sick of people telling me
I worry too much.

64
00:02:49,688 --> 00:02:52,601
This is the Constitution we're
talking about, not a stereo manual.

65
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,563
We'll just keep raising our voices.

66
00:02:54,646 --> 00:02:57,120
I don't see
what other choice we have.

67
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:05,203
Hey, Mr. Mayor.

68
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,081
How are you, Gray?

69
00:03:08,225 --> 00:03:10,790
Well, you mean aside from
the embolism you just gave me?

70
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:13,330
Let's take a walk, I'll explain.

71
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,092
Yeah, I-I'd appreciate that.

72
00:03:17,187 --> 00:03:19,480
- Didn't take them long, did it?
- For what?

73
00:03:19,607 --> 00:03:22,073
For J&R to build their
own private country.

<i>I can't believe things
got that bad that fast.</i>

78
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:54,562
I should've been there.
I'm wasting my time here.

79
00:03:54,647 --> 00:03:55,733
What do you mean?

80
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:57,861
This convention is a Sham.

81
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:01,752
And when it's done,
I'm don't think there's anything

82
00:04:01,827 --> 00:04:03,743
this government is not going
to have the power

83
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,683
to do in the name
of national security.

84
00:04:05,855 --> 00:04:07,803
How long till they vote to ratify?

85
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:11,171
I don't know. They're talking
about speeding things up to coincide

86
00:04:11,215 --> 00:04:12,940
with Texas joining
the Allied States.

87
00:04:12,988 --> 00:04:14,790
They're that close to a deal
with Texas?

88
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:16,701
Well, Cheyenne's pretty confident.

89
00:04:16,776 --> 00:04:19,781
And they've done a real good job
of painting the Texas into a corner.

90
00:04:19,898 --> 00:04:20,962
But, Jake,

91
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:23,232
you...

92
00:04:23,655 --> 00:04:26,321
you still haven't told me
what you're doing here.

93
00:04:26,845 --> 00:04:28,493
You need to go home, Gray.

94
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:33,313
The town, they need somebody that
they can look to who's not in hiding.

95
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,221
Someone to speak for them.

96
00:04:36,898 --> 00:04:38,420
But they need you back.

97
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:07,082
You spelled "Cheyenne" wrong.

98
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:08,380
Hey, Cheung.

99
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,252
I've spent the past few months
infiltrating J&R's secure data pipeline.

100
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,532
You know what's floating
around that pipeline right now?

101
00:05:15,578 --> 00:05:18,832
That the last loose nuke from the
September attacks is here in Cheyenne?

102
00:05:18,898 --> 00:05:22,093
The last loose nuke from the September
attacks is here in Cheyenne.

103
00:05:24,195 --> 00:05:26,012
- Want to explain how it got here?
- No.

104
00:05:26,215 --> 00:05:27,243
Not really.

105
00:05:27,747 --> 00:05:29,251
I'm here to get it back.

106
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:33,450
Hell of a lot's happened
over the last few months.

107
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:35,250
I'll try and fill you in.

108
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:43,530
Start with that.

109
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:47,421
What's "Phase Three"?

110
00:05:47,627 --> 00:05:49,430
As of 11:00 a.m. Tomorrow,

111
00:05:49,527 --> 00:05:53,451
they are going to declare whole
sections of town centers of resistance.

112
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:57,470
Anyone caught inside them after the
deadline will be considered insurgents.

113
00:05:58,195 --> 00:06:01,152
We're talking neighborhoods.
We're talking Main Street.

114
00:06:01,555 --> 00:06:04,560
Come tomorrow, Beck's men
are going to start shooting at people.

115
00:06:08,115 --> 00:06:09,660
We're running out of options.

116
00:06:11,465 --> 00:06:13,263
Our options are pretty clear.

117
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:14,951
Either we start shooting back,.

118
00:06:15,027 --> 00:06:16,592
or we give up our homes.

119
00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:20,902
- You don't have to fight them alone.
- What are you talking about?

120
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:24,160
What's happening to you guys right now
happened to us in New Bern weeks ago.

121
00:06:24,257 --> 00:06:26,003
We know what you're up against.

122
00:06:26,295 --> 00:06:28,171
Constantino knows how to fight it.

123
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:29,463
Not a chance in hell.

124
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:30,703
With an enemy this big,

125
00:06:30,747 --> 00:06:34,171
you really don't have the luxury
of being picky about your allies.

126
00:06:36,017 --> 00:06:37,543
We can help each other.

127
00:06:45,217 --> 00:06:46,682
Eric, are you kidding?

128
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,313
What am I supposed to say?

129
00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:53,102
You say no.

130
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:56,431
You say you're not interested
in shaking hands

131
00:06:56,476 --> 00:06:58,620
with an animal
like Phil Constantino.

132
00:06:59,498 --> 00:07:00,603
Say something.

133
00:07:04,626 --> 00:07:05,983
I'm done with this.

134
00:07:06,455 --> 00:07:07,261
Stanley!

135
00:07:07,306 --> 00:07:08,990
Bonnie has been dead
for four days,

136
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,792
and her body's still sitting in a box
in the medical center

137
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:13,690
because I'm hiding out
in some garage!

138
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,872
Stanley, where are you going?

139
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:18,163
To bury my sister.

140
00:07:26,638 --> 00:07:27,942
I need to do this.

141
00:07:41,805 --> 00:07:42,951
Go with him.

142
00:07:43,485 --> 00:07:44,593
Get it done.

143
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:46,730
Bring him back here
as soon as possible.

144
00:07:54,061 --> 00:07:55,406
Set up the meeting.

145
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:12,765
Sit down.

146
00:08:14,576 --> 00:08:15,757
I'd rather not.

147
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:18,521
Can we make this quick?

148
00:08:18,975 --> 00:08:21,130
I have to move out
of my house by 11:00 tomorrow.

149
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,451
Someone declared my street
a center of resistance.

150
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:24,813
Why'd you do it?

151
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,922
What are you talking about?

152
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:30,661
Yesterday, a terror suspect
was located not far from here:

153
00:08:30,738 --> 00:08:31,822
Robert Hawkins.

154
00:08:32,298 --> 00:08:35,991
He evaded capture, but we recovered
a nuclear weapon from his possession.

155
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:38,870
The same kind used
in the September attacks.

156
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,081
What does that have to do with me?

157
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:43,341
There was an aerial search
of this town.

158
00:08:43,646 --> 00:08:45,581
Should've exposed the bomb,
but didn't.

159
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,201
We checked the original data,

160
00:08:48,846 --> 00:08:50,472
and found a page missing

161
00:08:50,587 --> 00:08:52,530
from the copy kept in my office.

162
00:08:54,978 --> 00:08:56,150
You took it.

163
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:02,470
You had access to this office
I trusted you.

164
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:05,212
- I stood up for you.
- You're right.

165
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:07,492
I took it.

166
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:08,950
Why?

167
00:09:11,045 --> 00:09:13,832
He told me the people
you're working for are wrong.

168
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:15,153
And I believe him.

169
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:19,222
Do you realize I could have
you imprisoned, possibly executed?

170
00:09:19,335 --> 00:09:22,592
He said this government
is corrupt and illegitimate.

171
00:09:22,936 --> 00:09:25,830
That it lied about who attacked
us so it could seize power.

172
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,031
You're naive.

173
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,733
- And you're a coward.
- Excuse me?

174
00:09:30,326 --> 00:09:33,031
You know there's something wrong
with this country.

175
00:09:33,175 --> 00:09:35,711
And you refuse
to open your eyes and see it.

176
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:38,232
- My eyes are open.
- No, they aren't.

177
00:09:39,388 --> 00:09:42,353
And everyone in this town
is suffering because of it.

178
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:43,980
Lieutenant!

179
00:09:45,346 --> 00:09:47,023
This woman is under arrest.

180
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:49,873
Get her out of here.

181
00:09:58,336 --> 00:09:59,433
Here's what I got.

182
00:10:00,886 --> 00:10:03,013
It won't take them long
to inspect the bomb,

183
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:04,760
verify it is what they think it is.

184
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,161
To make it disappear for good,

185
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,493
they're gonna have move it to disposal
facility somewhere outside of town.

186
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,713
It'll be easier for us to hit it
when it's on the road get the transport.

187
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:14,803
That's the problem.
There's nothing scheduled.

188
00:10:14,846 --> 00:10:17,132
No convoys out of the
military base in the area.

189
00:10:17,195 --> 00:10:19,881
No shipments in or out
of the secure J&R facilities.

190
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:21,050
No nothing.

191
00:10:22,477 --> 00:10:23,600
You know what?

192
00:10:23,918 --> 00:10:25,211
There wouldn't be.

193
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:27,101
Security draws attention.

194
00:10:27,257 --> 00:10:30,811
So less security, less attention.
We need someplace off the books.

195
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:34,172
In Afghanistan, there were a few supply
routes that would get really nasty.

196
00:10:34,248 --> 00:10:36,401
They would shoot at anything
with a J&R logo on it.

197
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:39,111
So we started making our runs
in ambulances.

198
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:41,760
Check the local hospitals.

199
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:48,952
- St. Francis Hospital.
- What?

200
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:51,252
They reported a gas leak
a little while ago.

201
00:10:51,338 --> 00:10:53,341
They're closing
the doors for the afternoon.

202
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:19,812
How many paramedics
carry a nine millimeter?

203
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:25,170
It sure looks like
they're expecting someone.

204
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:26,030
Yeah.

205
00:11:30,885 --> 00:11:32,922
- Let's go.
- Not him.

206
00:11:34,506 --> 00:11:36,013
- What?
- Sorry, Jake,

207
00:11:36,105 --> 00:11:37,460
I don't know you...

208
00:11:37,776 --> 00:11:39,082
... I don't trust you.

209
00:11:39,196 --> 00:11:40,201
Hey, hey.

210
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:45,352
You keep the engine running.

211
00:11:45,597 --> 00:11:49,462
If something goes wrong, we're going
to need to get out of here fast. Right?

212
00:11:51,148 --> 00:11:52,150
Jake?

213
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:53,660
Yeah.

214
00:12:04,217 --> 00:12:06,491
<i>Green light from the colonel,
we're moving out ASAP.</i>

215
00:12:07,235 --> 00:12:09,942
<i>Double-check that,
make sure it's secure before we go.</i>

216
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:14,420
<i>Stay right there.</i>

217
00:12:29,236 --> 00:12:30,732
- <i>You okay?</i>
- Yeah.

218
00:12:31,238 --> 00:12:32,981
- You?
- Yeah,

219
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:34,272
I'm okay.

220
00:12:50,156 --> 00:12:51,602
Hello, Hawkins.

221
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:56,873
Smith?

222
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:06,923
Smith?

223
00:13:08,907 --> 00:13:10,980
I d... I didn't think

224
00:13:11,276 --> 00:13:13,693
that you did
your own dirty wo-work.

225
00:13:13,815 --> 00:13:15,273
I wasn't supposed to.

226
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:17,443
I had hoped
you were going to help me.

227
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:19,220
Now, I need that bomb.

228
00:13:22,197 --> 00:13:23,190
Hawkins!

229
00:13:23,447 --> 00:13:25,202
I'm okay, I'm okay.

230
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:26,810
I'm okay.

231
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:28,491
Jake, Jake,

232
00:13:29,036 --> 00:13:30,032
the ambulance.

233
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,243
I got you.

234
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,003
Get in.

235
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:49,142
How bad is it?

236
00:13:49,657 --> 00:13:50,892
I've had worse.

237
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:56,483
What the hell
are we going to do now?

238
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,132
Just keep driving.

239
00:13:58,407 --> 00:13:59,903
Just keep driving and...

240
00:14:00,265 --> 00:14:02,092
and let me think of something.

241
00:14:12,887 --> 00:14:14,942
Sir, can I get your signature here?

242
00:14:16,338 --> 00:14:17,450
What is it?

243
00:14:17,598 --> 00:14:20,762
Inventory of the evidence retrieved
from the terrorist Hawkins' vehicle.

244
00:14:20,857 --> 00:14:23,000
Sidearm, fake IDs, laptop.

245
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,592
Transport's waiting outside
to take it to Camp Liberty.

246
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:26,892
The evidence is here?

247
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:28,592
Yes, sir, boxed up
and ready to ship.

248
00:14:29,288 --> 00:14:30,680
I want to see it first.

249
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,933
Sir, it's catalogued and sealed.

250
00:14:34,388 --> 00:14:35,793
Then I'll unseal it.

251
00:14:36,755 --> 00:14:37,750
Yes, sir.

252
00:15:30,235 --> 00:15:31,241
Hawkins.

253
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:32,782
We got to get off the street

254
00:15:32,877 --> 00:15:34,781
or they're going
to be on us in no time.

255
00:15:34,987 --> 00:15:37,121
We're not going
to make it to Texas like this.

256
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,370
Yes, we will.

257
00:15:38,648 --> 00:15:40,013
Yes, we will.

258
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:44,872
Okay.

259
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,840
You'll keep going south...

260
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:51,032
for about...

261
00:15:51,187 --> 00:15:52,500
- ten blocks.
- Why?

262
00:15:52,598 --> 00:15:53,793
You just do it, Jake.

263
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:00,893
Hey, Chavez, I'm gonna need a favor,
and I'm going to need it fast.

264
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:26,491
Hello, Eric.

265
00:16:38,118 --> 00:16:39,393
Strange meeting.

266
00:16:40,465 --> 00:16:42,623
I'd have figured you
and I ever got this close again,

267
00:16:42,665 --> 00:16:44,183
It'd be at the end of a gun.

268
00:16:45,445 --> 00:16:48,572
A few weeks ago, I was on my way to
New Bern to put a bullet in your head.

269
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:49,863
What stopped you?

270
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:51,870
Beck.

271
00:16:52,716 --> 00:16:53,890
Interesting.

272
00:16:55,686 --> 00:16:57,623
Is that something
you still want to do?

273
00:16:58,065 --> 00:16:59,201
Every day.

274
00:17:00,055 --> 00:17:02,272
Something to be said for honesty.

275
00:17:05,627 --> 00:17:07,811
Russell told me
about your situation.

276
00:17:08,387 --> 00:17:10,632
If you and I are going
to be able to help each other,

277
00:17:10,678 --> 00:17:13,130
there's something you're going
to have to understand.

278
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:14,931
I'm listening.

279
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,782
We win by making them
lose their desire to fight.

280
00:17:17,886 --> 00:17:19,050
It's the only way.

281
00:17:19,297 --> 00:17:20,223
I know.

282
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:23,811
Then, when you take out a convoy,
you got to stop leaving soldiers alive.

283
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:28,432
Every soldier
we take out costs them,

284
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:33,081
forces them to train replacements,
saps their will.

285
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:35,681
It's not going to happen
in a day or a week.

286
00:17:36,245 --> 00:17:38,622
It's a process
that could take years.

287
00:17:39,706 --> 00:17:42,850
I need to know if that's something
you're willing to undertake.

288
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:52,660
Hawkins.

289
00:17:53,925 --> 00:17:54,921
<i>Yeah!</i>

290
00:17:55,435 --> 00:17:57,320
Hawkins, I need to know
where we're going!

291
00:17:57,396 --> 00:17:58,403
Okay.

292
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:00,991
<i>That way.</i>

293
00:18:01,036 --> 00:18:02,961
They're not just going
to open the gate for us.

294
00:18:03,108 --> 00:18:04,163
Straight in there.

295
00:18:05,145 --> 00:18:06,263
<i>Hang on.</i>

296
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:10,980
Hang on.

297
00:18:24,656 --> 00:18:25,903
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

298
00:18:26,095 --> 00:18:27,002
Don't shoot.

299
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:28,881
We need help.

300
00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:30,790
All right, we need help.

301
00:18:32,055 --> 00:18:33,633
My friend's been hurt. Please.

302
00:18:33,865 --> 00:18:35,440
Sir, this is a Texas embassy.

303
00:18:35,518 --> 00:18:38,012
You don't understand.
My friend's been shot.

304
00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:40,740
This isn't a hospital,
this is sovereign Texas soil.

305
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:41,720
Please.

306
00:18:51,717 --> 00:18:53,362
On the ground now!

307
00:18:54,076 --> 00:18:57,041
We are seeking political asylum.

308
00:18:58,617 --> 00:19:00,920
<i>Sir, we've got a situation
at the gate.</i>

309
00:19:01,297 --> 00:19:02,183
Go ahead.

310
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:03,953
<i>I've got Cheyenne military here.</i>

311
00:19:04,047 --> 00:19:07,491
<i>They claim a terrorist entered the
embassy. They want us to surrender him.</i>

312
00:19:08,287 --> 00:19:10,040
- Stand by.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

313
00:19:11,377 --> 00:19:13,410
I want those gates closed now,
radio down.

314
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:17,022
Tell 'em if anybody from Cheyenne tries
to breach, consider it an act of war.

315
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:18,600
Ambassador Sam Travis.

316
00:19:18,815 --> 00:19:20,243
You got important friends.

317
00:19:20,287 --> 00:19:22,031
I just got off the phone
with San Antonio.

318
00:19:22,075 --> 00:19:24,632
The governor's instructed me
to accept your request for asylum.

319
00:19:24,678 --> 00:19:26,680
Get this man immediate
medical attention.

320
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:28,650
I need a medic out here ASAP.

321
00:19:28,757 --> 00:19:29,811
<i>Right away, sir.</i>

322
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:31,910
Sir.

323
00:19:35,837 --> 00:19:36,892
Yeah, I know.

324
00:19:37,557 --> 00:19:38,923
Let's get it inside.

325
00:20:05,177 --> 00:20:06,390
What are you doing here?

326
00:20:07,318 --> 00:20:08,543
We came to help.

327
00:20:12,455 --> 00:20:13,652
You were right.

328
00:20:17,246 --> 00:20:18,591
Right about what?

329
00:20:19,126 --> 00:20:20,403
Constantino.

330
00:20:23,095 --> 00:20:26,282
There's something he lost
that I don't want to ever give up.

331
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:30,643
I mean, we're right
and Cheyenne is wrong, but...

332
00:20:31,216 --> 00:20:33,771
the moment we start killing
American soldiers,

333
00:20:34,106 --> 00:20:35,212
all that changes.

334
00:20:38,406 --> 00:20:39,640
So what do we do

335
00:20:39,908 --> 00:20:41,672
when they start shooting at us?

336
00:20:41,828 --> 00:20:44,821
I got to believe Beck doesn't
want that any more than we do.

337
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:50,021
But if he wants to make that decision,
I'm not going to make it easy for him.

338
00:20:51,477 --> 00:20:53,030
So I'm gonna be standing

339
00:20:53,576 --> 00:20:56,071
on this hill in
the open with my friends...

340
00:20:58,748 --> 00:21:00,651
doing something I know is right.

341
00:21:06,706 --> 00:21:07,712
Hey, guys.

342
00:21:28,756 --> 00:21:30,882
This is about all I can do from here.

343
00:21:31,068 --> 00:21:33,882
We're going to have to find a way
and get you to an ER.

344
00:21:34,275 --> 00:21:35,560
What do you mean, "no"?

345
00:21:38,128 --> 00:21:39,883
Could you excuse us, please?

346
00:21:45,497 --> 00:21:46,490
Jake...

347
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:49,431
... I am not important.

348
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,102
What is is getting that bomb
to Texas

349
00:21:52,205 --> 00:21:53,682
with no detours.

350
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,703
Now, you tell me
that you understand what it is

351
00:21:58,748 --> 00:22:01,323
- you're in the middle of right how.
- I understand it's important,

352
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:03,631
Yeah, it's important.

353
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,092
Like whatever happens
in the next few hours

354
00:22:06,177 --> 00:22:08,123
could determine
the course of things for...

355
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:09,671
for years to come.

356
00:22:10,005 --> 00:22:12,913
You know, maybe our history
for the next hundred years.

357
00:22:13,847 --> 00:22:16,350
That is the responsibility
we got here.

358
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,780
And if that comes at a terrible cost,
then so be it.

359
00:22:21,747 --> 00:22:24,140
Because that's the only way
that things get better,

360
00:22:24,236 --> 00:22:26,452
and it's the only way
that people stay free.

361
00:22:33,506 --> 00:22:35,313
That's why I do what I do.

362
00:22:40,696 --> 00:22:43,113
Yes, sir. Stanley Richmond
and a group of Rangers.

363
00:22:43,216 --> 00:22:44,512
I'll bring 'em in.

364
00:22:47,156 --> 00:22:49,092
- Ma'am, you need to clear this area.
- Please.

365
00:22:49,136 --> 00:22:52,180
My fiancé is burying his sister up
there. He's waited four days to do this.

366
00:22:52,228 --> 00:22:54,571
- Please, let him finish.
- We've already called it in.

367
00:22:54,617 --> 00:22:57,631
- We have orders to apprehend him now.
- Corporal Adams, but you have him.

368
00:22:58,146 --> 00:22:59,782
We have nowhere to run.

369
00:23:00,176 --> 00:23:02,362
Just let him put his sister
in the ground.

370
00:23:02,896 --> 00:23:04,450
It costs you nothing.

371
00:23:07,248 --> 00:23:08,882
Do-Do you have sisters?

372
00:23:09,205 --> 00:23:10,393
Or a girlfriend?

373
00:23:10,917 --> 00:23:11,872
A wife?

374
00:23:13,847 --> 00:23:14,850
Please.

375
00:23:16,155 --> 00:23:17,533
You have 30 minutes.

376
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:19,672
After that,
they're all coming with us.

377
00:23:20,516 --> 00:23:21,672
So say your good-byes.

378
00:23:22,715 --> 00:23:23,712
Thank you.

379
00:24:09,485 --> 00:24:10,510
ID, sir?

380
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:12,763
Excuse me?

381
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:15,541
Who are you, sir?

382
00:24:16,817 --> 00:24:18,142
I'm Gray Anderson.

383
00:24:21,247 --> 00:24:22,943
I'm the mayor of this town.

384
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,930
I don't how much longer we
can keep 'em talking at the gates.

385
00:25:03,007 --> 00:25:04,923
We're going to have
to get you out of here.

386
00:25:05,298 --> 00:25:06,290
Okay.

387
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:09,460
We're going to take you out
back to the property next door.

388
00:25:09,548 --> 00:25:11,623
Bomb's ready in a car
with diplomatic plates.

389
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:15,110
Should get you through to the airport.
The plane's in Hangar 22.

390
00:25:15,468 --> 00:25:16,461
We'll...

391
00:25:17,718 --> 00:25:19,900
I've had a bad feeling
about President Tomarchio.

392
00:25:19,957 --> 00:25:22,873
I'm glad somebody's gonna finally
show the world what he's really about.

393
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:24,401
That's the plan, so...

394
00:25:24,536 --> 00:25:25,531
Yeah.

395
00:25:49,095 --> 00:25:50,800
The bomb's stored.
Let's get out of here.

396
00:25:50,845 --> 00:25:52,123
- No. I'm staying.
- What?

397
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:54,452
It's at least an hour's
flight from here to Texas.

398
00:25:54,507 --> 00:25:56,723
Is no way it takes them that long
to find you in the plane.

399
00:25:56,768 --> 00:25:59,140
- You don't know that.
- It's the only way, okay?

400
00:25:59,206 --> 00:26:01,291
I got to buy you some time,
draw their attention.

401
00:26:01,336 --> 00:26:03,353
You don't stand chance
you stay here on your own.

402
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:06,962
And it doesn't matter, because
the mission is everything. I told you.

403
00:26:07,996 --> 00:26:09,292
No, it isn't.

404
00:26:09,496 --> 00:26:10,492
Come on.

405
00:26:10,538 --> 00:26:12,531
Damn it, Jake!
I am not debating this.

406
00:26:12,645 --> 00:26:14,052
I'm not debating, either.

407
00:26:14,297 --> 00:26:15,633
I'm ignoring you.

408
00:27:35,408 --> 00:27:36,682
- Wait here.
- Yes, sir.

409
00:27:54,858 --> 00:27:56,413
I'm sorry for your loss.

410
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:01,020
Thank you.

411
00:28:04,077 --> 00:28:05,562
You're all free to go.

412
00:28:11,187 --> 00:28:12,343
Wait a minute.

413
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:16,503
That's it?

414
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:27,493
About 20 minutes ago,

415
00:28:28,927 --> 00:28:30,490
I notified my company commanders.

416
00:28:30,538 --> 00:28:33,232
That I'd no longer be taking orders
from the Cheyenne leadership.

417
00:28:35,478 --> 00:28:37,332
I believe this government

418
00:28:37,906 --> 00:28:39,450
is corrupt at its core.

419
00:28:40,758 --> 00:28:42,350
Its actions are criminal,

420
00:28:42,935 --> 00:28:45,570
and I no longer recognize
their right to lead.

421
00:28:45,706 --> 00:28:46,891
So what happens now?

422
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:51,410
My company commanders
are deliberating,

423
00:28:51,728 --> 00:28:54,993
trying to decide whether
to report me up the chain of command.

424
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,762
In all likelihood, I'll be...

425
00:28:58,207 --> 00:29:00,020
charged by the end of the day.

426
00:29:00,496 --> 00:29:03,433
Sent to Cheyenne to face
a court-martial for treason.

427
00:29:06,608 --> 00:29:08,693
But until then,
I'm still in charge,

428
00:29:09,508 --> 00:29:10,963
so you take your time.

429
00:29:15,508 --> 00:29:16,713
And then go home.

430
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:00,881
<i>Unidentified Cessna</i>

431
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:03,730
<i>on heading zero-eight-six,
identify.</i>

432
00:30:05,316 --> 00:30:06,453
<i>Unidentified Cessna</i>

433
00:30:06,495 --> 00:30:09,570
<i>on heading zero-eight-six,
identify.</i>

434
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:12,920
Cessna on heading zero-eight-six:

435
00:30:13,056 --> 00:30:14,622
Sierra-Tango-Nine.

436
00:30:15,088 --> 00:30:17,943
<i>This is Allied States
Air Force Whiskey-Two-Three.</i>

437
00:30:18,027 --> 00:30:20,140
<i>We have orders to intercept
and escort you back</i>

438
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:21,911
<i>to Rogers Field in Cheyenne.</i>

439
00:30:24,047 --> 00:30:26,472
<i>Sierra-Tango-Nine,
confirm transmission.</i>

440
00:30:26,727 --> 00:30:28,710
Sierra-Tango-Nine, negative.

441
00:30:28,925 --> 00:30:32,903
This is a Texan diplomatic flight
out of Cheyenne en route to San Antonio.

442
00:30:33,388 --> 00:30:36,771
<i>Sierra-Tango-Nine, either put down,
or we will put you down.</i>

443
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,083
<i>You have 30 seconds to comply.</i>

444
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:48,702
This is a consular flight flying
the flag of a sovereign nation.

445
00:30:48,785 --> 00:30:51,020
<i>This is your last chance,
Sierra-Tango-Nine.</i>

446
00:30:51,106 --> 00:30:53,173
<i>We will put you
in the dirt if we have to.</i>

447
00:30:53,256 --> 00:30:54,782
<i>You've got ten seconds.</i>

448
00:31:06,205 --> 00:31:07,141
<i>Time's up.</i>

449
00:31:07,187 --> 00:31:09,752
<i>We're going weapons hot
to engage. Out.</i>

450
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:13,231
<i>Wait a minute.</i> Wait a minute!

451
00:31:56,766 --> 00:31:58,912
<i>Sierra-Tango-Nine, do you copy?</i>

452
00:31:59,477 --> 00:32:01,061
Sierra-Tango-Nine, affirmative.

453
00:32:01,206 --> 00:32:04,540
<i>Jake Green, this is Colonel Thompson,
Texas Air National Guard.</i>

454
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:07,562
<i>I've got orders direct
from Governor Todd</i>

455
00:32:07,607 --> 00:32:10,222
<i>to make sure you arrive safely
at Lackland Air Force Base.</i>

456
00:32:10,507 --> 00:32:12,241
Copy that, Texas ANG.

457
00:32:12,337 --> 00:32:14,191
<i>Son, I don't know
what you're carrying,</i>

458
00:32:14,237 --> 00:32:16,393
<i>but whatever it is better be good,</i>

459
00:32:16,508 --> 00:32:19,202
<i>'cause I think I just declared war
on Cheyenne.</i>

460
00:33:02,307 --> 00:33:03,350
Stanley...

461
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:12,901
What is it?

462
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:19,931
I thought I lost you.

463
00:33:24,177 --> 00:33:26,142
No way. You could never lose me.

464
00:33:27,515 --> 00:33:29,542
When those soldiers
were coming for you,

465
00:33:29,586 --> 00:33:31,063
all I could think was,

466
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:34,062
"He doesn't know
what he means to me.

467
00:33:35,575 --> 00:33:38,443
"He's going away forever,
and I haven't told him."

468
00:33:40,368 --> 00:33:41,782
Well, I'm here now.

469
00:33:44,248 --> 00:33:46,363
You are everything to me.

470
00:33:49,767 --> 00:33:50,873
I want to...

471
00:33:53,015 --> 00:33:56,852
I want to walk down this hill
and make a home with you.

472
00:33:57,645 --> 00:33:59,621
I want to make a life with you.

473
00:34:00,116 --> 00:34:01,860
Through anything and everything.

474
00:34:02,858 --> 00:34:05,343
From this day forward,
for the rest of my life.

475
00:34:09,635 --> 00:34:11,380
That sounded a lot like a...

476
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:12,872
It was.

477
00:34:18,576 --> 00:34:20,092
Well, what do I say?

478
00:34:21,545 --> 00:34:22,662
Just say I do.

479
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:27,310
I do.

480
00:34:28,127 --> 00:34:29,133
I do.

481
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:09,800
I told the lieutenant
to release you without condition.

482
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,510
You don't need to be here.

483
00:35:13,367 --> 00:35:14,362
I know.

484
00:35:23,877 --> 00:35:25,503
What's happening in there?

485
00:35:27,796 --> 00:35:30,273
They're trying to decide
what to do about me.

486
00:35:30,626 --> 00:35:32,020
Gave 'em Hawkins' laptop.

487
00:35:32,087 --> 00:35:34,020
Let them see the evidence
for themselves.

488
00:35:34,998 --> 00:35:36,130
You were right.

489
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:39,140
About everything.

490
00:35:43,027 --> 00:35:44,972
Thanks for not giving up on me.

491
00:36:20,027 --> 00:36:21,020
<i>Sir...</i>

492
00:36:23,478 --> 00:36:24,753
... your orders?

493
00:36:30,675 --> 00:36:32,261
Pass the word to your men.

494
00:36:32,868 --> 00:36:34,843
Tell them there's a fight on its way.

495
00:37:06,238 --> 00:37:09,231
I thought I told you to stay
out of trouble while I was gone.

496
00:37:09,305 --> 00:37:10,473
Welcome back.

497
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:12,013
Thank you.

498
00:37:12,055 --> 00:37:14,113
- How was the convention?
- Terrifying.

499
00:37:15,085 --> 00:37:17,481
The government
we find ourselves living under

500
00:37:17,557 --> 00:37:19,782
is in dire need of replacement.

501
00:37:22,076 --> 00:37:25,261
Well, that oughta make our
feelings pretty clear about it.

502
00:37:26,146 --> 00:37:27,150
That?

503
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:29,082
Yeah, I just...

504
00:37:29,535 --> 00:37:32,423
thought it's been a little
too long since Johnston Green's

505
00:37:32,496 --> 00:37:35,461
had anything to say about
the way things are going around here.

506
00:37:35,765 --> 00:37:38,782
Now seemed like a good
time for him to be heard.

507
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:56,110
Hey. We made it.

508
00:38:00,577 --> 00:38:01,593
What now?

509
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:05,112
There's a team of engineers waiting
for delivery of this thing right away.

510
00:38:05,515 --> 00:38:06,940
Once they inspect it,

511
00:38:07,526 --> 00:38:10,563
things in this country
are goin to change pretty fast.

512
00:38:11,396 --> 00:38:13,542
Cheyenne's cover-up
will be exposed.

513
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:17,421
Texas sides with Columbus,
throws its weight behind them,

514
00:38:17,698 --> 00:38:19,110
and then the main event.

515
00:38:19,345 --> 00:38:21,280
The next American civil war.

516
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,483
Yeah. And thanks
to you and Hawkins,

517
00:38:23,546 --> 00:38:26,033
looks like the good guys
are going to have a fighting chance.

518
00:38:27,968 --> 00:38:28,952
Thank you.

519
00:38:52,675 --> 00:38:54,771
Hey, don't take this
the wrong way.

520
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:58,560
But you look like crap.

521
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:05,092
You all right?

522
00:39:10,818 --> 00:39:13,013
I think we started a war today.

523
00:39:15,537 --> 00:39:17,350
Let me guess not your first?

524
00:39:20,198 --> 00:39:23,153
Jake, this war is coming
with or without us.

525
00:39:25,748 --> 00:39:28,883
I just hope we did enough
to make it a fair fight.

526
00:39:30,558 --> 00:39:31,553
Yeah.
