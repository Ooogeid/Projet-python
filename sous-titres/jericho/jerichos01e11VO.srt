1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,615
usly onJericho:

2
00:00:02,216 --> 00:00:03,700
<i>All right, it looks like</i>
<i>the explosion</i>

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,380
came from the west,
maybe Denver.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,082
<i>Maybe one of you</i>
<i>would like to tell me</i>

5
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:17,249
just exactly who you
think is in charge here.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,716
<i>Gray's finally getting</i>
<i>that election, huh?</i>

7
00:00:19,783 --> 00:00:20,683
Is the mayor nervous?

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,983
Not as nervous as he should be.

9
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,500
You're blushing.

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,520
It's a reaction
to the iodine, okay?

11
00:00:27,584 --> 00:00:29,916
It's a reaction to having your
shirt off in front of me.

12
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,350
Did you steal
from me, Dale?

13
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:36,950
After everything
I have done for you?

14
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:38,799
Everything you've done for me?

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,433
You wouldn't have a store
if it wasn't for me.

16
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,699
Where are you going?
To get the
generator.

17
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:44,132
From Jonah?
Yeah.

18
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:46,266
Even if you get a generator,
it won't end there.

19
00:00:46,332 --> 00:00:48,633
<i>If you push my father,</i>
<i>Jake,he'll push back.</i>

20
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,583
Mitchell Cafferty,
that is not yours!

21
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:53,117
Whoa, easy, big fella.

22
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:55,517
Mitchell and the other guys
don't see our arrangement

23
00:00:55,517 --> 00:00:56,899
the way I do.

24
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,765
<i>Gracie, we've got all</i>
<i>this food out here.</i>

25
00:00:58,766 --> 00:01:01,049
We sure could use
a place to distribute it.

26
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,550
You'd have to stop doing
business with Jonah.

27
00:01:03,617 --> 00:01:05,183
GRACIE:
I'm in.

28
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,584
SAMUEL:
Dad! I need you.
Right now!

29
00:01:39,417 --> 00:01:40,650
Dad!

30
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:44,816
Hey.

31
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,333
What you got there?

32
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:48,601
A football.

33
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:51,140
Yeah, yeah.
I know that.

34
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,050
What's it for?

35
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,790
You have to
teach me to play.

36
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,601
Why?

37
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:55,933
'Cause I don't know how.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,434
Well, I'm not
sure I know how.

39
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:01,915
Okay, okay, uh...

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,167
I know a little.

41
00:02:04,234 --> 00:02:07,439
Come on.
What, this is something that
has to be done right now?

42
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,319
Yeah.

43
00:02:11,134 --> 00:02:12,600
Okay.

44
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,917
Hey, what are you doing?

45
00:02:19,134 --> 00:02:20,572
Putting a hand
pump on this well,

46
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,150
so we don't have to waste
generator power for water.

47
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:24,751
There's really
a well under there?

48
00:02:25,517 --> 00:02:28,050
First well in Jericho,
according to the sign.

49
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:31,617
I remember another
first that happened right there.

50
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,709
You shouldn't have dared me.

51
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,999
Nobody had to dare you.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,434
Yeah, well, I remember
one of your finer moments.

53
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,833
Right over there,
behind Bailey's.

54
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,167
Mm-hmm.

55
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,600
Yeah, let's not
talk about that.

56
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:45,100
I could get sick right here.

57
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:47,434
Some people can't hold their
apple wine coolers.

58
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,367
No. No.

59
00:02:49,434 --> 00:02:52,083
You kept singing that
depressing song

60
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,133
by that uh, that bald girl.

61
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,334
Sinead O'Connor,
and that was our song.

62
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,033
Our song?
I never got to vote.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,667
Hey, um, let's-let's talk about
what happened right there.

64
00:03:06,734 --> 00:03:08,933
The day you went to
get medicine for your dad.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,149
Heather kissed you.

66
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,011
She talked to me about it.

67
00:03:12,012 --> 00:03:14,033
Yeah, I-I don't want
her to get hurt.

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,367
I have no plans to do that.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,766
Mrs. Leigh?

70
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,134
Mrs. Leigh!

71
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,233
Mrs. Leigh.

72
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,734
Oh, Gracie!

73
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:45,600
(sobbing):
No!

74
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,534
Dad.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,567
Do we know who did this?

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,500
No witnesses.

77
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,399
She was already gone
by the time Dale found her.

78
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:10,900
Sure Dale didn't kill her?

79
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,565
The blood on the floor
has been drying for a long time.

80
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:17,383
And that boy is incapable
of doing something like that.

81
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:20,533
Nobody is incapable
under the right circumstances.

82
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,399
JIMMY:
Mayor Green, Mitchell Cafferty

83
00:04:22,466 --> 00:04:24,266
has something to tell you.

84
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:25,199
What the hell...

85
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:25,966
You back off!

86
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:26,900
Easy.

87
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,133
Jonah said he killed her,
but I didn't believe him.

88
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,016
Jonah Prowse
said he did this?

89
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,033
Jonah showed up at the compound,
and his arm was all torn up.

90
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,966
He said that he killed Gracie
because she wouldn't do
business with him anymore.

91
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,066
He was trying to prove to me
and the rest of the guys

92
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:46,232
that he was
still in charge.

93
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:47,599
Where's Jonah now?

94
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,250
I don't know.

95
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:50,499
He hit me with
a tire iron,

96
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,498
I just saw
him driving off.

97
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,666
You believe this guy, Johnston?

98
00:04:53,282 --> 00:04:54,133
He broke out of our jail.

99
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,532
He's a fugitive.

100
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:57,749
Listen, I wouldn't blame you
if you locked me up right now.

101
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,187
But if you want any help
tracking down Jonah,

102
00:05:02,204 --> 00:05:03,353
I'm ready.

103
00:05:05,487 --> 00:05:08,669
Eric, why don't you
talk to Mitch here?

104
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,886
See if he can help.

105
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,586
Let's go.

106
00:05:15,153 --> 00:05:17,320
This guy is a
criminal, Johnston.

107
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:18,520
Yeah, I know what he is.

108
00:05:18,587 --> 00:05:19,886
I'm trying to figure
out what he knows.

109
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,220
We can arrest him anytime.

110
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,586
We just had our first
murder in 30 years.

111
00:05:23,587 --> 00:05:26,287
And I've been mayor of this
town for 25 of those years!

112
00:05:26,354 --> 00:05:27,619
Maybe that's the problem.

113
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,987
You still think Jericho's
the same sweet little town,

114
00:05:30,053 --> 00:05:31,120
it was before the bombs.

115
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:32,153
We need somebody
who understands...

116
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,287
Save it for
the election, Gray.

117
00:05:33,354 --> 00:05:34,853
This is what the
election is about!

118
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,687
You want to get this civilian
off the crime scene?

119
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:45,053
Just tell me the
name of the song.

120
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,554
If you don't remember,
I'm not telling you.

121
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:50,254
I remember it was
sad and depressing.

122
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,753
You must not remember
our relationship.

123
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,187
It's a great house.

124
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:58,087
Yeah, thanks.

125
00:05:58,153 --> 00:05:59,886
The first one Roger
and I looked at.

126
00:05:59,953 --> 00:06:01,254
We made an offer immediately.

127
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,287
Well, when you know what
you want, why keep looking?

128
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:07,487
Thanks for walking me home.

129
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,053
Thanks for helping
with the well.

130
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:15,087
Bye.

131
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,520
Shh!
Shh-shh-shh.

132
00:06:29,587 --> 00:06:31,503
Don't say a word.

133
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:39,600
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com Present</font>

134
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:48,700
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:XXY
Sync:FRM@openext</font>

135
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,087
I just heard.

136
00:06:53,154 --> 00:06:54,636
I'm so sorry, Dale.

137
00:06:55,637 --> 00:06:57,302
The only lead we have
to go on right now

138
00:06:57,303 --> 00:06:59,520
is that Mitchell Cafferty
said Jonah confessed.

139
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:00,753
Mitch is not much of a witness.

140
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,569
I was there yesterday,
when Gracie stood up to Jonah.

141
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,221
She said she wasn't going to
do business with him anymore.

142
00:07:06,236 --> 00:07:08,171
He couldn't have been
too happy about that.

143
00:07:08,236 --> 00:07:10,670
All right. We need to pull a
couple of guys off of patrol

144
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:11,852
and go find them.
If Jonah did this,

145
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:14,219
 he is not going to come in willingly.

146
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:14,920
I'm coming, too.

147
00:07:14,987 --> 00:07:15,786
No, Dale.

148
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,254
I know how to shoot a gun.

149
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,086
Son, the last thing you need
to be doing right now

150
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:21,830
is waving a gun around at the
man you think killed Gracie.

151
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,687
He did it.

152
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,196
You said yourself she stood up
to Jonah, and now she's dead.

153
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,263
You're not going, Dale.

154
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,034
There's something that
I have to talk to you about.

155
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:36,686
Gray's going to use this
for all it's worth, Dad.

156
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:39,351
A lot of people are starting to listen to him.
Well,you listen to me.

157
00:07:39,355 --> 00:07:41,800
I've known Gracie all my life.

158
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:43,799
We're going to find
the man who did this.

159
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,667
We're going to bring
him to justice.

160
00:07:44,668 --> 00:07:46,333
And I do not want
to hear another word

161
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:47,567
about this election.

162
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,401
Yes, sir.

163
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:56,267
Any news on Jonah?

164
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,401
No, no one in here has seen him.

165
00:08:00,368 --> 00:08:02,101
Jonah better hope that
Gray doesn't find him.

166
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,800
He says he's going to make
an example out of him.

167
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:06,400
What's he going to do,
string him up?

168
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:08,817
You can't kill someone in
the middle of Main Street.

169
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:09,699
Yeah?

170
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,880
Tell that to Gracie Leigh.

171
00:08:12,134 --> 00:08:14,700
Gray came back from
Topeka a changed man.

172
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,067
He's not messing around.

173
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,370
And I, for one, think
he's got the right idea.

174
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,070
W-wait a minute.

175
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:22,850
You're not voting
for Gray Anderson?

176
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:25,483
I'm not going to answer that.

177
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,850
This is still America.

178
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:29,583
Yeah, just barely.

179
00:09:03,483 --> 00:09:04,750
MIMI:
Bonnie!

180
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:06,266
Bonnie!

181
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:10,400
Bonnie!

182
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,184
Bonnie!

183
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,050
Bonnie!

184
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,083
Okay, that was good.

185
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,449
Um... let's try again.

186
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,780
What was good
about that?

187
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,813
I don't know.

188
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,896
Just pick up
the ball.

189
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,949
Why can't you throw it
to somebody else

190
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,152
when they're chasing you?
I don't know what you mean.

191
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,449
When they're chasing you.

192
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,946
When who is
chasing who, son?

193
00:10:21,013 --> 00:10:22,013
The guys
that want the ball.

194
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,980
God, why do you suck at this?

195
00:10:24,047 --> 00:10:25,762
Hey, you got
to watch your mouth.

196
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:28,249
Hey, it's too cold for you to be

197
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,940
out here playing
without jackets.

198
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,166
How's it going?

199
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,233
Not so well.

200
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,283
I need to get back to work.

201
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,399
Son, the trick is

202
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,299
the grip,
all right?

203
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,866
Put your little finger
and your ring finger...
no, this one.

204
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:46,219
Yeah, it should go
on the white stripe.

205
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,000
Thumb goes
underneath it.

206
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,433
Okay? And just go...

207
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,111
just-just throw
it to me.

208
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,100
Okay?

209
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,215
All right.

210
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:55,365
There's nothing
wrong with that.

211
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:57,965
Hey, I thought basketball
was your game.

212
00:10:57,966 --> 00:10:59,430
They're kind of all my games.

213
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:05,359
Hey, Jake.

214
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,459
Need your help.

215
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,210
I'll be right there.

216
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,433
So, where we going?

217
00:11:19,434 --> 00:11:21,247
Jonah's compound.

218
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:23,801
My dad and Eric
are meeting us there.

219
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:25,799
You think he's still out there.

220
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,379
I think he doesn't have
a lot of places to hide

221
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,968
or a lot of people
to turn to.

222
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,901
Well, he must have some other
friends in town or maybe family.

223
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,478
Hold on.

224
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,530
What if they can't find him?

225
00:11:43,546 --> 00:11:44,847
He can't just get away
with this.

226
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,114
They'll find him.

227
00:11:48,063 --> 00:11:50,199
What am I supposed to do?

228
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,698
Sit down, Dale.

229
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:52,965
There's some things
you need to know.

230
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:56,866
Come on.

231
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:06,999
After the bombs
went off and

232
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:10,666
your mother died,
Gracie changed her will.

233
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:14,133
She left her store to you.

234
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:15,732
I was the witness.

235
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:20,166
The papers are in a locked box
at the bank along with the keys.

236
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,099
Nobody expects a 16-year-old boy

237
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,567
to run that business.

238
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:27,849
You need to take
some time

239
00:12:27,966 --> 00:12:31,300
and think about what
you're going to do
with all this.

240
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:33,632
I'll be there if you need me.

241
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:36,515
I can't take her store.

242
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,499
I quit.

243
00:12:38,565 --> 00:12:40,300
I called her a liar.
I said the worst things...

244
00:12:40,366 --> 00:12:42,499
That happens in families.

245
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:47,366
People get mad,
say things.

246
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:50,966
But that doesn't erase
everything that came before.

247
00:12:51,033 --> 00:12:53,666
Gracie loved you.

248
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:56,933
And she wanted you
to have her store.

249
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:08,999
Come on, guys,
check around back.

250
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,999
Whoa, whoa, what
are you doing, Gray?

251
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,799
Manhunt, same as you.

252
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,649
Got to thinking that
Jonah might be coming
to Emily for sympathy.

253
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,415
We can handle this.
Yeah? Who's that?

254
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,350
Those of us who have been
training to protect this town.

255
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,683
You're doing a hell
of a job.

256
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,199
This is dangerous, Gray.

257
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,083
We can't just have a bunch of
vigilantes running around town.

258
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:25,416
It's a little late for that.

259
00:13:25,483 --> 00:13:26,650
I've seen two other
truckloads of guys

260
00:13:26,717 --> 00:13:27,949
running around
this neighborhood.

261
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,216
The town is heading
towards chaos.

262
00:13:30,283 --> 00:13:32,683
It's not going to calm down till
somebody finds Jonah Prowse.

263
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,616
What's going on?

264
00:13:35,683 --> 00:13:36,616
We're looking for Jonah Prowse.

265
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,350
He killed Gracie Leigh.

266
00:13:39,849 --> 00:13:42,216
Since he's your father...
Not in any way that matters.

267
00:13:42,283 --> 00:13:44,982
Well, we'd like to look
around a little bit.
No.

268
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:46,350
She wouldn't hide him, Gray.

269
00:13:47,366 --> 00:13:48,717
We're going to look around
a little bit

270
00:13:48,783 --> 00:13:49,882
and then we'll be gone.

271
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:51,550
Hey.

272
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,499
There's no sign of him
in the backyard.

273
00:13:57,499 --> 00:13:58,249
That's good news.

274
00:13:58,316 --> 00:14:00,949
Come on, I'll patrol
with you for a while.

275
00:14:05,683 --> 00:14:06,699
Let's go, Gray.

276
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:16,683
Watch this house.

277
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:24,849
Let's go.

278
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:29,483
Thank you.
Where is he?

279
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:30,283
I don't know what
you're talking about.

280
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,183
You didn't even blink when
you heard about Gracie.

281
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:33,483
Where is he?
Jake...

282
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,367
I didn't kill Gracie Leigh.

283
00:14:50,634 --> 00:14:52,834
Then why are you holding
us at gunpoint?

284
00:14:55,201 --> 00:14:56,533
'Cause maybe
you won't believe me.

285
00:14:56,534 --> 00:14:57,614
Maybe you'll try

286
00:14:57,615 --> 00:14:59,900
and be some kind of hero
and take me in.

287
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,401
He's bleeding.
He needs a doctor, Jake.

288
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,633
JONAH:
I'm not going
into town.

289
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,334
Jake, you're going to help

290
00:15:04,334 --> 00:15:06,199
me get out of here.
I'm not helping you
do anything.

291
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,000
For all I know,
you're a murderer.
I didn't do it!

292
00:15:10,301 --> 00:15:11,549
I walked out this morning--

293
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,000
found myself surrounded
by my own men.

294
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:15,369
Mitchell Cafferty's there.

295
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:18,134
He tells me Gracie Leigh's
been murdered.

296
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:20,967
When I asked him who did it,
Mitchell says to me, "You did.

297
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,099
And I saw the whole thing."

298
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,099
Before
I knew it,

299
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,199
he's got a knife on me.

300
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,984
And he sliced my arm open.

301
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,100
But I took a crowbar to him
before he could finish the job.

302
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:32,699
Your guys sided
with Mitch?

303
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,767
It didn't sit too well with them

304
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:35,834
that my little girl

305
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,000
stole our haul
from the food drop

306
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:39,366
and I stopped Mitchell Cafferty

307
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:40,499
from putting a bullet
in her brain.

308
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,234
So they did this to you
because you wouldn't kill me?

309
00:15:45,101 --> 00:15:46,583
Okay, okay, okay.

310
00:15:46,584 --> 00:15:47,200
Get him up.
(groans)

311
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,099
We got to take him in.

312
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,250
But we got to be careful.

313
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,299
There are a lot
of people out there

314
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,099
who would rather shoot first

315
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,284
and ask questions later.

316
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Mitchell will keep coming
until he kills me.

317
00:15:57,434 --> 00:15:58,534
We'll take him
to Town Hall.

318
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,867
You'll be safe there.

319
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:02,110
Those guys will walk
right in that jail...

320
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,399
and kill me and anyone else
who gets in their...

321
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,434
What'd you come here for, huh?

322
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,099
You put your own
daughter at risk...
Shut up!

323
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,100
Just get him... just get him
a doctor.

324
00:16:12,434 --> 00:16:14,530
Okay, okay

325
00:16:22,433 --> 00:16:23,850
Dale.
Hey.

326
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,167
What happened?

327
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:30,534
She was murdered... stabbed.

328
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,200
Dale...

329
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,367
Dale!

330
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:35,834
I just heard.

331
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,417
SEAN:
You the one
who found her?

332
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,084
Yeah.

333
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,022
Open the place up.

334
00:16:43,023 --> 00:16:44,568
Let's have some fun.

335
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:45,684
Back off, Sean.

336
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,599
What do you care?
It's not your store.

337
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,834
Yeah, it is.

338
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,250
All of it.

339
00:16:53,251 --> 00:16:54,418
What are you talking about?

340
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:56,200
Gracie gave it to me.

341
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,367
Worked out for you
then, huh?

342
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:04,367
Dale...

343
00:17:04,434 --> 00:17:05,767
Stop it.

344
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:07,900
You're lucky I don't
take you out right here.

345
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:09,600
SKYLAR:
Get out of here, Sean.

346
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:12,401
Sean, you all right?

347
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:16,034
Come on, get out.

348
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,167
See you around?

349
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,600
Hey.

350
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:29,099
Did you find
the guy?

351
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,683
No, no, not yet.

352
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:33,599
Um, look, I got
to check on something
in the basement,

353
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,517
and then I'm going back
out there with Gray
and his men...

354
00:17:35,518 --> 00:17:38,000
Between that basement
and all the men with guns...

355
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:39,901
Hey.

356
00:17:41,468 --> 00:17:43,001
What's wrong?

357
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,551
Robert, is this what we have
to look forward to?

358
00:17:47,468 --> 00:17:48,717
People showing up,

359
00:17:48,718 --> 00:17:51,449
you grabbing that damn gun
and running off?

360
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,170
It's not all that different
than before.

361
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:56,267
Yeah, that worked out so well
for us, didn't it?

362
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,350
So when are we going
to lose you?

363
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,633
Lose me?

364
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,600
I don't know that you are.

365
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:13,750
The kids are getting used
to having you here.

366
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:15,600
Yeah?

367
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,984
What about you, D?

368
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:22,201
Me, too.

369
00:18:33,201 --> 00:18:34,633
I don't want to go anywhere.

370
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,101
I like being here.

371
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:41,051
You lock the basement--

372
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:44,484
or you tell those
men to fight their own
battles and stay home.

373
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,600
The damn world ended.

374
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:51,767
Can't you just be with us?

375
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:58,734
Kenchy, I need you
to come with me.

376
00:18:59,501 --> 00:19:00,459
Where?

377
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,284
I'll tell you on the
way to the medical
center, all right?

378
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,166
Look, we need some supplies.

379
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:08,265
Oh... you want me
to kill someone?

380
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:10,149
You need a real doctor,
my friend.

381
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,933
A real doctor wouldn't do
what I need done.

382
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,300
Come on.
Let's go.

383
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,150
How bad is it?

384
00:19:24,934 --> 00:19:27,400
Well, whoever did this
used a serrated edge.

385
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:29,950
We could have done
without that.

386
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,584
Did you stop the bleeding?
Mostly.

387
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,967
I gave him a shot
for the pain.

388
00:19:37,034 --> 00:19:38,883
Probably fall asleep now.

389
00:19:38,884 --> 00:19:39,951
Is this the guy?

390
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,200
The murderer everybody's
talking about?

391
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,949
He says no.

392
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,434
Oh, no one's going
to believe him.

393
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:50,400
They're
out for blood.

394
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:52,851
He's not going to get
a fair shake.

395
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:55,267
Yes, he will.

396
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:56,399
I'll go get my dad.

397
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,884
He can bring him in, make sure
things are done the right way.

398
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:01,268
It's Jonah's only chance.

399
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:05,230
Okay.

400
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,801
All right.

401
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:09,583
Lock the door.

402
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,500
Mind if I wash
my hands?

403
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,778
We're not safe.

404
00:21:56,701 --> 00:21:59,834
Gracie's death makes
that all too clear.

405
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,768
I tell you what, Mary.

406
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:04,699
The chaos I saw when I was
fighting my way back home

407
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,616
to Jericho, well now,

408
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,067
it's right here
on our Main Street.

409
00:22:08,734 --> 00:22:12,484
Criminals like Jonah Prowse
think we're easy targets now.

410
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,999
Well, I'll tell
you what, Neil.

411
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,049
I think we should go
find Jonah Prowse

412
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,401
and make an example of him.

413
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,359
And he shouldn't get
to sit around for 15 years

414
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,220
before he gets
what's coming to him.

415
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,880
We got to send
a message.
(murmured assent)

416
00:22:24,017 --> 00:22:26,184
Crime will
not be tolerated.

417
00:22:26,701 --> 00:22:27,933
We are willing

418
00:22:27,934 --> 00:22:31,550
to do whatever it takes
to keep Jericho safe.

419
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:33,801
So please remember
at the polls tomorrow...

420
00:22:33,868 --> 00:22:35,100
Dad, I need your help.

421
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:37,801
...to vote Gray Anderson
for a new Jericho.

422
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,768
Watch it.

423
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:47,933
Sorry about that, Ma.

424
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,634
Oh, no, no.
We are not doing that.

425
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:52,749
Come on, now.
You can call me Pa.

426
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,584
Seriously, that
really creeps me out.

427
00:22:55,401 --> 00:22:57,801
Good creepy
or bad creepy?

428
00:22:57,868 --> 00:22:59,134
What?

429
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,517
Look.

430
00:23:01,634 --> 00:23:05,501
What we did...
it's not what you think.

431
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:08,534
I had a weak moment.
It was a mistake.

432
00:23:10,101 --> 00:23:11,334
Well, I'm really good
at making mistakes.

433
00:23:12,051 --> 00:23:13,933
Yes, you are.

434
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,933
Believe me, it was
a pleasant surprise,

435
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,501
but we can't
do this anymore.

436
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:23,067
Because of Bonnie?

437
00:23:23,134 --> 00:23:24,701
Yeah, I'll talk to her.

438
00:23:24,768 --> 00:23:26,100
She'll be fine.

439
00:23:27,617 --> 00:23:29,516
Do you know how many
second dates I've had

440
00:23:29,517 --> 00:23:31,301
in the last
five years?

441
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:33,120
I'm guessing not many.

442
00:23:33,734 --> 00:23:35,150
And do you know why?

443
00:23:35,601 --> 00:23:37,868
Yeah, because you're obnoxious

444
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:40,834
and demanding and
totally self-absorbed.

445
00:23:42,134 --> 00:23:43,100
Yeah.

446
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:50,567
And you are sweet, simple
and bull-headed.

447
00:23:51,334 --> 00:23:53,250
You can't handle
someone like me.

448
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,121
This will never work.

449
00:23:55,122 --> 00:23:58,050
Ah, that's what they said
about Brangelina.

450
00:23:58,601 --> 00:24:02,100
Are you seriously quoting
<i>Us</i> magazine right now?

451
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:04,634
Yeah, what do you think
they'd call us?

452
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:06,367
Stimiley?

453
00:24:06,434 --> 00:24:08,467
Mimiley?

454
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:10,067
St...

455
00:24:10,134 --> 00:24:11,334
Stimi.

456
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,934
You are such an idiot.

457
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,190
You're harboring
a criminal, Jake.
He's hurt.

458
00:24:26,191 --> 00:24:27,999
And he needed a doctor,
so I got one,

459
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,149
and then I came to you.

460
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,789
Well, we have got us one
hell of a problem, Jake,

461
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,849
because if anyone knows
that you've been hiding

462
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,799
Jonah Prowse
while the whole town

463
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,799
has been out looking for him,
they'll throw us all in jail.

464
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,349
Jonah says Mitchell
killed Gracie

465
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,190
and then he
set him up.
What do you think?

466
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:42,449
He might be telling the truth.

467
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,799
You're not a judge or a jury.

468
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,639
Now, we're gonna go get him,
we're gonna bring him in...

469
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,801
Good, that's what
I came here for!
Well, you better hope...

470
00:24:48,868 --> 00:24:50,200
He's gone.

471
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,667
Let's get him!

472
00:25:10,534 --> 00:25:11,399
Come on!

473
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,250
That's him!
Let's get him!

474
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,320
Well, well...

475
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:24,799
Jonah Prowse.
Can't get away
from us, huh?

476
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,999
Pick him up!

477
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,610
Get him up, guys.

478
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:42,000
All right, let's go.
Get out of the truck.

479
00:26:03,492 --> 00:26:05,292
Do you solemnly swear
to uphold the laws

480
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,491
of the State of Kansas

481
00:26:06,492 --> 00:26:08,400
and faithfully discharge
the duties of Mayor?

482
00:26:08,926 --> 00:26:10,292
I do.

483
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:12,726
Congratulations.

484
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:21,359
Friends, thank you for
placing your trust in me

485
00:26:21,425 --> 00:26:23,626
to lead Jericho
through this difficult time.

486
00:26:25,392 --> 00:26:28,093
This town belongs
to all of us

487
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,759
and we must work
together to survive.

488
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,026
The resources of this town
also belong to all of us,

489
00:26:39,093 --> 00:26:42,592
and therefore, as my first
official act as Mayor,

490
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:44,726
I am ordering the food
from the food drop

491
00:26:44,793 --> 00:26:46,893
to be distributed immediately.

492
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:56,459
And now,
to the subject of security.

493
00:26:56,526 --> 00:27:00,193
One of our citizens
was brutally murdered.

494
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,260
But her murderer will be
held to account.

495
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:13,093
Justice will be swift and sure,
you have my word.

496
00:27:20,459 --> 00:27:23,126
Don't take that too serious.

497
00:27:23,193 --> 00:27:26,826
They're not calling for
your head on a platter.

498
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,359
Why'd you run?

499
00:27:30,425 --> 00:27:32,526
My father was going
to bring you in...

500
00:27:32,592 --> 00:27:35,193
Your father just got
shown the door, Jake.

501
00:27:51,993 --> 00:27:53,292
I didn't want this
to happen.

502
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,826
Jonah made his own bed.

503
00:28:03,193 --> 00:28:05,126
I'm sorry your dad
lost the election.

504
00:28:05,193 --> 00:28:07,559
I feel if I hadn't
gotten you involved...
No.

505
00:28:07,626 --> 00:28:11,392
The people spoke, and they got
exactly what they wanted.

506
00:28:23,126 --> 00:28:23,893
What do you want,
Mitchell?

507
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,059
Just visiting.

508
00:28:28,726 --> 00:28:30,000
Hey, sweetie?

509
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,492
Do you mind giving me
and my man here

510
00:28:31,492 --> 00:28:32,492
a little privacy?

511
00:28:33,793 --> 00:28:34,993
It's okay.

512
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,609
I'll be back in a second.

513
00:28:42,193 --> 00:28:44,726
So I hear you and I are
going to be partners now.

514
00:28:44,793 --> 00:28:46,392
Where'd you get that?

515
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:49,226
Well, you're running the store,
you're gonna need protection.

516
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:51,692
From who?
Jonah's in jail.

517
00:28:55,325 --> 00:28:57,692
This has nothing
to do with Jonah.

518
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:00,859
Don't make the same
mistake that Gracie made.

519
00:29:00,926 --> 00:29:02,793
I get half the cut.

520
00:29:05,793 --> 00:29:07,525
Or those people out there
are going to be putting

521
00:29:07,526 --> 00:29:09,960
flowers and candles on
the sidewalk for you.

522
00:29:16,425 --> 00:29:18,526
Okay?

523
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,050
See you tomorrow...

524
00:29:22,425 --> 00:29:25,126
and the next day.

525
00:29:25,193 --> 00:29:26,392
And the next day.

526
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,209
Are you knitting?

527
00:29:33,126 --> 00:29:36,226
Yeah, it's one of the few things
that ever just zoned me out.

528
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:39,126
I learned in
the dorm at Vassar.

529
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,559
Not so hot for me now, are you?

530
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,400
No, it's just, um...

531
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,759
Actually, I think that
belonged to my mother.

532
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,250
Oh, my God.

533
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,392
I am... so sorry.

534
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,993
I found it half finished
in a trunk upstairs.

535
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:57,359
It's okay.
No, no, no.

536
00:29:57,425 --> 00:29:58,993
I'll-I'll put it back.
No, no, no.

537
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:00,292
I think...

538
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:02,759
I think you should finish it.

539
00:30:04,826 --> 00:30:06,147
No, I couldn't.

540
00:30:06,302 --> 00:30:07,859
Look, it's okay.

541
00:30:12,293 --> 00:30:14,510
I actually think my mother
would have liked you.

542
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,424
Really?

543
00:30:19,425 --> 00:30:20,959
No, not at all.

544
00:30:37,893 --> 00:30:38,826
Manley.

545
00:30:40,826 --> 00:30:42,459
Our tabloid name.

546
00:30:42,526 --> 00:30:44,226
Mimi and Stanley. Manley.

547
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:47,859
Is that <i>really</i> the message you
want to be putting out there?

548
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:49,492
You're right.
Good point.

549
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:52,592
Stimi's better.

550
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,993
Dad...
We're going
to have to...

551
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:30,559
take down all
these posters.

552
00:31:30,626 --> 00:31:32,193
Get this place
back to normal.

553
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,160
I don't think normal's
where we're headed.

554
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,700
(chuckles):
Yeah.

555
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,325
I, uh...

556
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I'm sorry.

557
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,386
So am I.

558
00:31:47,676 --> 00:31:48,276
DALE:
Mayor!

559
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,458
Mitchell Cafferty did it.

560
00:31:53,459 --> 00:31:54,626
What?

561
00:31:54,692 --> 00:31:56,459
He killed Gracie.

562
00:31:56,526 --> 00:31:58,459
What are you
talking about, Dale?
He said if I

563
00:31:58,526 --> 00:32:00,399
refuse to give him a cut of the
store, he'd do to me

564
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,592
what he did to Gracie.

565
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,000
Let's find Gray.

566
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:09,626
All right, Jonah.

567
00:32:09,692 --> 00:32:11,559
Get up. Let's go.

568
00:32:11,626 --> 00:32:13,026
Let's go.

569
00:32:13,093 --> 00:32:14,459
Where you taking me?

570
00:32:14,526 --> 00:32:16,093
You'll find out
when we get there.

571
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,559
JOHNSTON:
Gray, what
are you doing?

572
00:32:17,626 --> 00:32:21,226
We're moving him to
a more secure location.

573
00:32:21,292 --> 00:32:24,359
There's a lot of folks
who want to rip him
apart after what he did.

574
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:26,692
We don't know what he did.
He hasn't had a trial yet.

575
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:28,592
Well, these are special
circumstances, Johnston.

576
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:31,093
We don't have a judge.
As mayor, I formed

577
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,492
a tribunal, and
he was found guilty.
You did what?

578
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:35,893
Mitch just told Dale that
he would do to him

579
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:38,292
what he did to Gracie
if he didn't go along with him.

580
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,692
Well, did anyone else
hear him say that?

581
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:44,059
No.
That's hardly proof.

582
00:32:44,126 --> 00:32:45,592
What? You think I'm
lying? I'm not lying.

583
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:47,059
GRAY: He was trying
to intimidate you.

584
00:32:47,126 --> 00:32:48,926
It doesn't mean
he actually did it.

585
00:32:48,993 --> 00:32:50,160
JAKE:
This is unbelievable.

586
00:32:50,226 --> 00:32:50,993
You don't even care
who killed her.

587
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:51,893
You just want Jonah.

588
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:52,726
I've got Jonah!

589
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:53,759
He's innocent.

590
00:32:53,826 --> 00:32:55,026
He's far
from innocent!

591
00:32:55,093 --> 00:32:56,492
He's been preying on
this town for years!

592
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,292
From now on,
guys like him

593
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:01,160
go away! We don't coddle them,
we don't make deals with them.

594
00:33:01,226 --> 00:33:02,959
JAKE:
What are you planning
on doing, Gray?

595
00:33:03,026 --> 00:33:04,325
You going to kl him
in cold blood?

596
00:33:04,642 --> 00:33:06,993
Say he tried to escape
while moving him to

597
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:08,059
a secure location?

598
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,892
Who's going to do it?
Bill?

599
00:33:10,893 --> 00:33:12,160
You gonna

600
00:33:12,226 --> 00:33:13,292
put a bullet
in Jonah's head when Gray

601
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,859
tells you to?

602
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,993
I'm not shooting anybody.

603
00:33:19,993 --> 00:33:22,160
It's up to you, Gray.

604
00:33:22,226 --> 00:33:24,359
Go on.

605
00:33:24,425 --> 00:33:25,726
No?

606
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,410
This is what you want,right?

607
00:33:31,826 --> 00:33:33,793
You make the rules?
Decide who lives and dies?

608
00:33:33,859 --> 00:33:35,359
Go ahead
and do it.

609
00:33:35,425 --> 00:33:37,392
But you do it here,

610
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:38,692
in front of me and Dale.

611
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,059
In front of everyone.
Not... not in some

612
00:33:40,126 --> 00:33:41,260
back room with your buddies.

613
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:47,392
Don't let someone else do
the dirty work for you, Mayor.

614
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:49,449
You want him dead?
You take this gun

615
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,026
and blow his
brains out.

616
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,109
Gray, no.

617
00:33:58,126 --> 00:33:59,492
You better
be damn sure he's guilty.

618
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:01,459
Because if he's not,

619
00:34:01,526 --> 00:34:02,993
you're a murderer,

620
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,559
and justice
will be swift.

621
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,045
HNSTON:
<i>Jonah agrees to leave town</i>

622
00:34:33,111 --> 00:34:34,778
and not come back.

623
00:34:34,844 --> 00:34:36,078
Exile.

624
00:34:36,145 --> 00:34:37,744
Worked for the Greeks.

625
00:34:37,811 --> 00:34:38,978
The town gets
rid of Jonah Prowse,

626
00:34:39,045 --> 00:34:41,210
and you get to save face.

627
00:34:41,277 --> 00:34:43,444
All right.

628
00:34:43,511 --> 00:34:45,310
Now, what about Mitchell
Cafferty?

629
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:46,611
Why don't you
let me handle that?

630
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,377
Look, um... Johnston,

631
00:34:52,444 --> 00:34:55,145
I love this town.

632
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:57,377
I just want to keep it safe.

633
00:34:57,444 --> 00:34:59,577
Like it always was.

634
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:04,910
What it always was
is a democracy.

635
00:35:05,377 --> 00:35:09,045
That's easy when things
are going all right.

636
00:35:09,111 --> 00:35:12,878
But when you're scared or mad,

637
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,511
it gets to be a lot harder.

638
00:35:15,577 --> 00:35:18,511
I'll try to watch
out for that.

639
00:35:18,577 --> 00:35:20,177
Oh, I think
we'll all be watching.

640
00:35:23,344 --> 00:35:26,611
You know, my father--
your grandfather--

641
00:35:26,678 --> 00:35:29,811
he was a... he was
an excellent athlete.

642
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,577
You know?
I mean, all sports, Sam.

643
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:35,444
He won lots of awards
when he was in school.

644
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:37,011
But the thing is,
when I was

645
00:35:37,078 --> 00:35:39,145
your age,
he was in the Air Force,

646
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,978
and he was gone a lot,

647
00:35:41,045 --> 00:35:44,678
and he didn't have time
to teach me much, so...

648
00:35:44,744 --> 00:35:46,878
Sam, that's why

649
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,511
I suck at football.

650
00:35:49,577 --> 00:35:51,011
Me, too.

651
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,411
I'm sorry about that, son.

652
00:35:56,045 --> 00:35:58,978
Yeah.

653
00:35:59,045 --> 00:36:00,244
Oh, here she comes.

654
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,711
Come on. Okay?
Come on.

655
00:36:01,778 --> 00:36:03,145
Ready?

656
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,544
Hut!

657
00:36:07,244 --> 00:36:08,744
You practice hard.

658
00:36:11,744 --> 00:36:13,244
There you go, Coach.

659
00:36:15,045 --> 00:36:17,878
Hey, hey.

660
00:36:21,277 --> 00:36:22,678
I'm here.

661
00:36:22,744 --> 00:36:25,911
Okay? Right here.

662
00:36:34,761 --> 00:36:35,577
Robert!

663
00:36:35,644 --> 00:36:37,369
Hey, isn't that what
football players do

664
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,277
to each other?

665
00:36:42,244 --> 00:36:44,444
This will keep you warm.

666
00:36:49,045 --> 00:36:51,444
Emily, when
Chris was born...
Don't.

667
00:36:51,511 --> 00:36:56,078
When Chris was born,
you were four years old.

668
00:36:56,145 --> 00:36:58,411
Your mother said she
wanted a clean break.

669
00:36:58,477 --> 00:37:00,944
I was into
some bad stuff,

670
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,377
and she didn't
want you and Chris
growing up in it,

671
00:37:03,444 --> 00:37:07,078
so I let her go.

672
00:37:07,145 --> 00:37:09,344
But I didn't want to.

673
00:37:09,411 --> 00:37:12,344
She never got over you.

674
00:37:12,411 --> 00:37:15,210
We loved each other.

675
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:17,744
It was like...

676
00:37:17,811 --> 00:37:19,344
Like you and Jake.

677
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:22,711
Don't blame Jake for
your brother's death.

678
00:37:22,778 --> 00:37:24,978
That's on me.

679
00:37:25,045 --> 00:37:27,911
I pushed Chris
to do that job.

680
00:37:27,978 --> 00:37:30,477
He wasn't ready. He wasn't
cut out for that kind of life.

681
00:37:30,544 --> 00:37:32,644
Jake wanted out.

682
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:34,878
I didn't understand
that then,

683
00:37:34,944 --> 00:37:37,011
but I sure do now.

684
00:37:52,045 --> 00:37:54,045
That boy still loves you.

685
00:38:28,045 --> 00:38:30,277
Don't you have a
curfew or something?

686
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:33,544
No.

687
00:38:36,244 --> 00:38:37,678
Cool.

688
00:39:02,611 --> 00:39:04,449
So this is what
you've been saving

689
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,177
your generator
rations for.

690
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:07,644
Nice music, Mary.

691
00:39:07,711 --> 00:39:11,778
I'll have cold coffee
and candles the rest of my life

692
00:39:11,844 --> 00:39:14,444
if I can just have
music now and then.

693
00:39:18,611 --> 00:39:20,878
You know
I love you, right?

694
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:22,577
Yes.

695
00:39:28,145 --> 00:39:30,344
Hey.

696
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:31,911
Hey.

697
00:39:34,978 --> 00:39:36,544
How did it go?

698
00:39:38,744 --> 00:39:40,145
He's gone.

699
00:39:43,477 --> 00:39:45,944
It's the best thing for now.
Yeah.

700
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:49,045
Yeah.

701
00:39:49,111 --> 00:39:51,177
You don't suppose they have any

702
00:39:51,244 --> 00:39:53,377
of those apple wine coolers
back there, do you?

703
00:39:53,644 --> 00:39:56,177
Feel like talking, huh?

704
00:39:56,244 --> 00:40:00,011
No. Just the opposite.

705
00:40:00,078 --> 00:40:01,878
Hey, Mary,

706
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:03,344
can we get

707
00:40:03,411 --> 00:40:05,310
two more of whatever
it is you're pouring?

708
00:40:17,078 --> 00:40:18,611
It almost looks
normal in here.

709
00:40:18,678 --> 00:40:22,145
Like the bombs
never even happened.

710
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:29,411
Let's stay in here
as long as we can, huh?

711
00:40:36,111 --> 00:40:43,210
* It's been seven hours
and 15 days... *

712
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:46,277
Finally remembered
the name of that song.

713
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:50,310
Mary had it
on the jukebox.

714
00:40:50,377 --> 00:40:53,177
* Since you been gone *

715
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:54,444
Come on.

716
00:40:54,511 --> 00:40:57,911
Come on!
* I can do whatever I want *

717
00:40:57,978 --> 00:41:02,511
* I can see whoever I choose *

718
00:41:06,644 --> 00:41:13,711
* I can eat my dinner
in a fancy restaurant *

719
00:41:13,778 --> 00:41:15,811
* But nothing *

720
00:41:15,878 --> 00:41:21,944
* I said, nothing
can take away these blues *

721
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:26,944
* 'Cause nothing compares *

722
00:41:27,011 --> 00:41:30,711
* Nothing compares to you... *

723
00:41:30,778 --> 00:41:32,511
What about Heather?

724
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,577
What about Roger?

725
00:41:37,644 --> 00:41:39,477
You know how this goes.

726
00:41:39,544 --> 00:41:43,477
We should be grown-ups,
and walk away right now.

727
00:41:45,678 --> 00:41:47,411
You're right.
We should.

728
00:41:47,477 --> 00:41:51,011
* Like a bird without a song *

729
00:41:55,011 --> 00:42:02,911
* I know that living with you,
baby, was sometimes hard *

730
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:07,811
* But I'm willing
to give it another try... *

731
00:42:07,878 --> 00:42:09,210
ERIC:
Jake!

732
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:11,577
Jake, we got
to go outside. Now!
Let's go.

733
00:42:11,644 --> 00:42:13,878
* Nothing compares... *

734
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,844
They need help.

735
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:18,978
Take them inside.

736
00:42:19,045 --> 00:42:20,370
Jake!

737
00:42:20,744 --> 00:42:23,210
Some of them were
on planes that landed

738
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,411
in the middle
of nowhere.

739
00:42:24,477 --> 00:42:26,111
They've been
walking for weeks.

740
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:28,577
They must have
gone through hell.

741
00:42:37,244 --> 00:42:38,811
Oh, my God!

742
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:42,411
Roger.

743
00:43:03,444 --> 00:43:05,244
Who the hell is that?

744
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:08,937
