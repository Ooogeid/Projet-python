1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
Previously on Jericho...

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,190
Jake Green.

3
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,550
How you doing, man?

4
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,040
- Wait a minute, where the hell you been?
- Around.

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,390
Jake, no one's been around for five years.

6
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,530
Seriously...

7
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,030
where have you been?

8
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,080
Hey, brother.

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,780
- What you put this family through...
- Johnston, for God's sake...

10
00:00:16,786 --> 00:00:19,791
- Now, he could've been...
- You could spend a week talking
about what I could've been, all right?

11
00:00:19,793 --> 00:00:23,400
- Stay one more day.
- I gotta get back to San Diego by tomorrow.

12
00:00:24,806 --> 00:00:28,465
All right, looks like the explosion
came from the west, maybe Denver.

13
00:00:30,412 --> 00:00:33,198
- Are we under attack?
- This could've be a test,
could've been an accident.

14
00:00:33,197 --> 00:00:33,962
Hi, Dale.

15
00:00:34,126 --> 00:00:36,050
Sorry I didn't call sooner, Angel, but we...

16
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:37,921
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

17
00:00:37,928 --> 00:00:38,892
I am so sorry.

18
00:00:38,896 --> 00:00:41,752
- I didn't know your mother was in Denver.
- She was in Atlanta.

19
00:00:41,758 --> 00:00:42,991
Oh, my God!

20
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:47,050
- My mom died yesterday.
- I think my mom died yesterday, too.

21
00:00:47,428 --> 00:00:49,030
Get April.
We'll meet you at the medical center.

22
00:00:49,036 --> 00:00:50,892
There's an empty prison bus out there.

23
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:53,031
Look, I know you're telling people
it was an accident,

24
00:00:53,036 --> 00:00:55,140
but if it was an attack, Sheriff...

25
00:00:55,465 --> 00:00:56,943
...there's chaos out there,

26
00:00:57,176 --> 00:00:58,580
you might not want the wrong people knowing

27
00:00:58,586 --> 00:00:59,951
that Jericho was still here.

28
00:01:00,987 --> 00:01:01,823
Riley!

29
00:01:03,665 --> 00:01:05,262
Is there anybody on this channel?

30
00:01:05,505 --> 00:01:06,723
There are men here with guns.

31
00:01:06,737 --> 00:01:08,622
I think they might have killed the sheriff.

32
00:01:09,038 --> 00:01:11,102
Won't the rain clear
the radiation out of the air?

33
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:15,001
- Yes, and bring it straight down
on Jericho. - How do you know
about radiation, Mr. Hawkins?

34
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:16,602
Because I was a cop in St. Louis

35
00:01:16,608 --> 00:01:18,583
and after 9-11, we got up to speed.

36
00:01:18,585 --> 00:01:20,283
How long before the radiation gets here?

37
00:01:20,287 --> 00:01:22,851
How long does it normally take a storm to
get here from Denver?

38
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:23,901
Less than two hours.

39
00:01:23,908 --> 00:01:26,423
Everyone over here can go
to the town hall shelter.

40
00:01:26,427 --> 00:01:28,482
All those on the north side
will go to the clinic.

41
00:01:28,815 --> 00:01:29,841
Our shelter's no good.

42
00:01:30,087 --> 00:01:31,432
I'm bringing these people to town hall.

43
00:01:31,436 --> 00:01:32,302
They can't come in here, Jake.

44
00:01:32,307 --> 00:01:34,052
- What do you mean they can't come in here?
- We're packed.

45
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:35,621
The salt mine, how many people will it hold?

46
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:36,922
We have to seal the entrance.

47
00:01:36,927 --> 00:01:37,921
There's no door, Jake.

48
00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:39,900
Well, we can't just let the rain
pour down the shaft.

49
00:01:39,908 --> 00:01:41,021
These people won't be safe.

50
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:42,203
We're all clear.

51
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,260
- What's happening out there?
- I don't know.

52
00:01:45,265 --> 00:01:46,492
You always know something.

53
00:01:46,665 --> 00:01:48,761
You know, don't ask me questions.

54
00:03:12,197 --> 00:03:13,371
She's still not talking.

55
00:03:14,668 --> 00:03:15,602
I get that.

56
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:17,641
I mean, I'm a cop.

57
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,673
I've never killed anybody.

58
00:03:20,276 --> 00:03:21,463
She'a schoolteacher.

59
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:25,773
Where's Stanley?

60
00:03:26,197 --> 00:03:28,942
Jake, my brother doesn't know
about the radiation.

61
00:03:29,526 --> 00:03:30,743
When the rain stops,

62
00:03:30,986 --> 00:03:32,342
he'll be back, don't worry.

63
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:34,102
Bonnie, I know Stanley.

64
00:03:34,106 --> 00:03:34,930
He'll be fine.

65
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:37,872
Jake, I got your brother.

66
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,682
- He's with your dad.
- Finally.

67
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:43,361
- Eric, how's Dad?
- He's good.

68
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:45,513
The town hall shelter is secure.

69
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:48,792
Listen, Jake, where are you?

70
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:50,233
I'm at the Richmond's.

71
00:03:50,385 --> 00:03:51,263
As soon as the rain stops,

72
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:53,640
get every digging tool you can
find and get to the mine

73
00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:55,961
I had to blow the entrance
to keep the rain out.

74
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:58,502
These people have been sealed
up way too long.

75
00:03:59,185 --> 00:04:00,720
And I'm more worried the explosion

76
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:02,870
might have put some debris
into the ventilator.

77
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:04,641
Enough to slow it down?

78
00:04:04,886 --> 00:04:06,223
Enough to shut it down.

79
00:04:06,388 --> 00:04:07,541
We got to get them out.

80
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:10,332
We can't reach anyone at the mine.

81
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:12,570
We have no radio contact with anyone there.

82
00:04:13,528 --> 00:04:15,422
Here, honey, take a little sip.

83
00:04:15,778 --> 00:04:17,620
Okay, just a little. Pass it on.

84
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:21,571
Good, you guys, good.

85
00:04:21,925 --> 00:04:23,422
Good, good, good.

86
00:04:24,868 --> 00:04:25,702
One second.

87
00:04:26,028 --> 00:04:27,071
I'll be right back.

88
00:04:27,097 --> 00:04:27,951
Excuse me.

89
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:31,080
Hey.

90
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:34,392
- How you holding up?
- Oh, Heather.

91
00:04:34,395 --> 00:04:36,571
I think our students
are taking it better than I am.

92
00:04:37,188 --> 00:04:39,823
They just know there's
nothing to be afraid of.

93
00:04:40,177 --> 00:04:41,810
For them, it's just like a bad field trip.

94
00:04:42,108 --> 00:04:43,921
I'll be fine.

95
00:04:43,927 --> 00:04:46,142
- Just having a hard time breathing.
- It's all right.

96
00:04:46,145 --> 00:04:47,771
Here, take a little water.

97
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:49,051
Yeah.

98
00:04:50,467 --> 00:04:51,381
Good.

99
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:52,652
I have to get outside.

100
00:04:52,868 --> 00:04:53,851
Soon.

101
00:04:54,216 --> 00:04:54,672
Soon.

102
00:04:54,678 --> 00:04:57,353
- Is Mr. Rennie okay?
- He's gonna be fine.

103
00:04:57,357 --> 00:04:59,900
We just need to give him
a little bit of room, okay?

104
00:05:00,026 --> 00:05:00,752
Go on back.

105
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:02,732
I can't do this!

106
00:05:02,738 --> 00:05:04,502
- Got to get outside!
- It's okay.

107
00:05:04,506 --> 00:05:06,393
Deep breath, deep breath.

108
00:05:26,288 --> 00:05:27,370
You doing all right?

109
00:05:29,937 --> 00:05:31,693
Stupid question?

110
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:33,253
Right.

111
00:05:35,366 --> 00:05:37,170
How do you know the rain's radioactive?

112
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:39,690
Denver's pretty far away.

113
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:43,322
Well, we don't know how many bombs
there were, we don't know...

114
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:49,683
What is it?

115
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,190
Someone's up in the house.

116
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:52,773
Not more prisoners?

117
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,813
- Stanley!
- Bonnie, thank God.

118
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:14,510
No! Hey, hey!

119
00:06:14,516 --> 00:06:15,521
No! Uh-uh.

120
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:18,331
Stanley, don't touch her.

121
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:20,261
The rain may be radioactive.

122
00:06:53,758 --> 00:06:55,951
April, Stanley seems to be okay.

123
00:06:56,698 --> 00:06:58,973
I'd say he was in it for about 20 minutes.

124
00:06:58,976 --> 00:07:00,992
Yeah, I was out at my cousin's

125
00:07:00,997 --> 00:07:02,472
helping him put the livestock up

126
00:07:02,475 --> 00:07:03,511
and got caught in it.

127
00:07:03,886 --> 00:07:04,870
Is he vomiting?

128
00:07:04,877 --> 00:07:06,170
No, he's not.

129
00:07:06,237 --> 00:07:08,323
Okay, do you have any iodine there?

130
00:07:09,318 --> 00:07:10,513
Bonnie, iodine?

131
00:07:13,956 --> 00:07:15,271
Hey, what's with all the tanks?

132
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:17,621
What tanks?

133
00:07:18,816 --> 00:07:20,260
On my way home, I passed a line of tanks.

134
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:21,613
They were hauling ass towards Denver.

135
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:23,403
Stanley, how many tanks did you see?

136
00:07:23,406 --> 00:07:25,562
- Five, maybe.
- Where?

137
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:26,430
They were over the ridge.

138
00:07:26,435 --> 00:07:28,193
I couldn't tell you
exactly where they were.

139
00:07:29,037 --> 00:07:31,303
But I was on Pharr's Mill Road near I-70.

140
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,482
April, we have iodine.

141
00:07:34,678 --> 00:07:36,892
He's going to need to take
a couple of tablespoons.

142
00:07:36,897 --> 00:07:37,513
But it tastes vile,

143
00:07:37,517 --> 00:07:38,882
so do you have any bread,

144
00:07:38,883 --> 00:07:40,350
something that he could take with it?

145
00:07:40,436 --> 00:07:41,765
We're in a cellar-- all we've got

146
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:43,548
is canned peaches and pickles.

147
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:44,643
Not the pickles.

148
00:07:44,986 --> 00:07:46,013
Maybe the peaches.

149
00:07:46,016 --> 00:07:48,291
Jake, just give me the iodine.

150
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:50,740
The second that the rain breaks,

151
00:07:50,747 --> 00:07:52,101
rush him to the clinic.

152
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:55,802
And, Jake...

153
00:07:58,026 --> 00:08:00,063
if he throws up in the next couple of hours

154
00:08:00,318 --> 00:08:01,970
get Bonnie out of that room.

155
00:08:02,245 --> 00:08:03,012
Why?

156
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:05,663
Because her brother's going to die.

157
00:08:22,857 --> 00:08:25,470
- Just concentrate on breathing, please
- I can't.

158
00:08:25,846 --> 00:08:26,440
Got to get out of here.

159
00:08:26,447 --> 00:08:28,261
- I know. Soon.
- I got to get out of here!

160
00:08:28,268 --> 00:08:30,373
Mr. Rennie, please, just concentrate
on your breathing.

161
00:08:30,846 --> 00:08:31,652
Look at me.

162
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:33,950
Controlled.

163
00:08:33,957 --> 00:08:34,870
Very...

164
00:08:34,886 --> 00:08:36,383
- I got to get out of here.
- I know, Mr...

165
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:37,400
I got to get out of here!

166
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,313
I don't want to die down here!

167
00:08:38,316 --> 00:08:39,293
Get me out of here!

168
00:08:39,356 --> 00:08:40,843
- I don't want to be here!
- Look, everybody just calm down.

169
00:08:40,845 --> 00:08:42,630
There's nothing to worry about.

170
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:44,423
- You're scaring the children, Scott.
- I can't breathe.

171
00:08:44,808 --> 00:08:47,261
- He's claustrophobic.
- We got to get him out of here.

172
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:48,180
- Look, it's me.
- I'm sorry.

173
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:50,070
It's Shep. Try to focus, man

174
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:51,580
- try to focus.
- I got to get out of here!

175
00:08:51,745 --> 00:08:53,752
- We got to get him away from these people.
- I got to get out of here!

176
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:54,652
I can't breathe!

177
00:08:54,945 --> 00:08:57,791
- I don't want to die down here!
- Please be careful!

178
00:08:58,446 --> 00:08:59,193
Please!

179
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:00,242
Stay back.

180
00:09:02,605 --> 00:09:04,280
I don't want to die down here!

181
00:09:04,298 --> 00:09:05,472
I don't...

182
00:09:05,486 --> 00:09:06,593
Get me out of here!

183
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:16,931
- Jake wants to talk to you.
- His cough's getting much worse.

184
00:09:16,935 --> 00:09:19,301
- I want you to make it brief.
- Okay, okay.

185
00:09:20,475 --> 00:09:21,542
Yeah, son, what is it?

186
00:09:21,547 --> 00:09:24,633
Dad, Stanley saw a line of tanks near I-70.

187
00:09:24,638 --> 00:09:26,301
Well, you know,
there's a National Guard unit

188
00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:27,711
to the southwest of there in Goodland.

189
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:29,500
Maybe they've got a relief effort going.

190
00:09:29,507 --> 00:09:30,910
We need to get out there and see.

191
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,073
That could be a dangerous thing to do, son.

192
00:09:33,075 --> 00:09:35,400
Can't just sit around and wait
to find out what's happening.

193
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,412
I'll go to Goodland.

194
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:38,211
Someone should check out Topeka.

195
00:09:38,498 --> 00:09:39,591
Okay, son.

196
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:46,093
I'm going with you.

197
00:09:46,515 --> 00:09:47,240
What?

198
00:09:47,548 --> 00:09:48,593
I have to find Roger,

199
00:09:48,596 --> 00:09:50,101
- and Goodland's on the way to Wichita.
- You're in no condition to...

200
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:50,960
I'm going.

201
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:52,920
With you or I'm going by myself.

202
00:10:00,806 --> 00:10:01,643
For the last time,

203
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:02,793
you can't smoke here.

204
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:11,091
- waters for everyone.
- Thank you, honey.

205
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:15,541
- Johnston, I need to take
your temperature again.
- Oh, you just took it five minutes ago.

206
00:10:15,607 --> 00:10:17,330
- Shh...
- Hasn't changed in five minutes.

207
00:10:17,337 --> 00:10:20,490
- The mighty Johnston Green
felled by the flu. - Here it comes.

208
00:10:20,498 --> 00:10:21,463
I don't know if I told you this

209
00:10:21,465 --> 00:10:23,210
but my father is impervious to mere germs.

210
00:10:23,217 --> 00:10:26,100
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, I believe that was the quote.

211
00:10:26,107 --> 00:10:28,823
- First inauguration-- have it all on video.
- It was a joke.

212
00:10:28,825 --> 00:10:29,490
I was trying to...

213
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,502
April, don't ever make a mistake.

214
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,872
This family will never let you forget it.

215
00:10:33,938 --> 00:10:35,171
Okay, I'll remember that.

216
00:10:35,898 --> 00:10:39,032
- Oh, come on.
- But still...
- Shh, Johnston.

217
00:10:45,166 --> 00:10:46,381
I don't like him.

218
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:49,983
Me neither.

219
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,160
Here.

220
00:11:10,255 --> 00:11:11,490
They're really stale.

221
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:39,972
You know, I keep thinking about

222
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,571
when we were kids

223
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:44,330
and how they used to make us practice

224
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,801
hiding under our desks

225
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,700
in case of an atomic bomb.

226
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:50,543
Yeah, duck and cover.

227
00:11:51,507 --> 00:11:52,600
That's the first thing I thought of

228
00:11:52,607 --> 00:11:54,562
when I saw that mushroom cloud.

229
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:59,700
Did they have enough time
to hide under their desks?

230
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:04,501
That's pretty stupid, huh?

231
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,141
No.

232
00:12:18,296 --> 00:12:19,221
Eric?

233
00:12:20,758 --> 00:12:22,062
I'm just a little confused.

234
00:12:22,445 --> 00:12:24,373
Your wife isn't really acting like someone

235
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:26,363
- who knows the marriage has
been dead a long time.
- Mary...

236
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:27,860
Or did I get the wrong impression?

237
00:12:31,385 --> 00:12:33,413
Mary, let's just get through this, okay?

238
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:34,552
Well, the next thing you're gonna tell me

239
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:36,490
is that she actually does understand you.

240
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:39,441
I'm sorry.

241
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:53,000
Jake, don't let Bonnie see your lips.

242
00:12:56,487 --> 00:12:57,170
Listen, man.

243
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:59,023
If this thing doesn't turn out so good--

244
00:12:59,365 --> 00:13:02,003
- the thing is,
Bonnie's still just a kid, so... - Stanley.

245
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:03,131
Don't even, all right?

246
00:13:03,135 --> 00:13:05,021
- You're gonna be fine.
- I don't know.

247
00:13:06,358 --> 00:13:07,721
My head is pounding and I feel like

248
00:13:07,728 --> 00:13:08,923
I'm gonna throw up.

249
00:13:19,646 --> 00:13:21,010
Eric, the rain has stopped.

250
00:14:17,617 --> 00:14:18,751
What's this black stuff?

251
00:14:19,915 --> 00:14:21,351
That used to be Denver.

252
00:14:30,075 --> 00:14:33,092
- Bill, Emily, get Stanley
to the medical clinic now. - Okay.

253
00:14:33,098 --> 00:14:34,470
Find April, she'll know what to do.

254
00:14:34,478 --> 00:14:36,933
- Jimmy, you're coming with me to ne,
all right? - Jake.

255
00:14:38,037 --> 00:14:40,143
- I meant what I said, all right?
- I know.

256
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:42,300
Look, I know, I know.

257
00:14:42,307 --> 00:14:44,670
I will help you find Roger.
- I promise, okay?

258
00:14:44,678 --> 00:14:46,492
Go, I'll meet you at the medical clinic.

259
00:14:46,497 --> 00:14:48,041
Eric, we're coming to the mine now.

260
00:14:48,046 --> 00:14:49,883
We have to dig those people out.

261
00:15:11,897 --> 00:15:12,760
What was that?!

262
00:15:15,838 --> 00:15:17,510
I think somebody's on the other side.

263
00:15:31,117 --> 00:15:32,492
Get these people out of here.

264
00:15:40,478 --> 00:15:41,642
All right, everyone,

265
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,371
you're gonna be okay.

266
00:15:47,135 --> 00:15:48,753
All right, we have food and water.

267
00:15:49,786 --> 00:15:51,272
And there are vehicles waiting for you guys

268
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:52,963
to take you to the clinic, all right?

269
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:54,141
Nice and slow.

270
00:15:54,146 --> 00:15:55,923
File out, these guys'll help you.

271
00:15:56,316 --> 00:15:57,562
Listen, you're okay.

272
00:15:57,616 --> 00:15:59,432
Women and children first.

273
00:16:00,738 --> 00:16:04,240
Please. Watch your step,
everyone, be careful.

274
00:16:05,695 --> 00:16:07,023
It's gonna be okay.

275
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,022
- Are you okay?
- I think so.

276
00:16:17,107 --> 00:16:18,771
Gray, what happened?

277
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:21,050
He's dead.

278
00:16:23,258 --> 00:16:24,240
What?

279
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:46,450
Hey.

280
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,970
- Hey, how's Stanley?
- We're still watching him.

281
00:16:48,977 --> 00:16:49,463
Where is he?

282
00:16:49,465 --> 00:16:51,391
- We had to isolate him.
- Where? Where is he?

283
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:00,113
What the hell?

284
00:17:01,306 --> 00:17:02,201
Do you like it?

285
00:17:02,685 --> 00:17:04,311
It's where they make
the contagious kids wait

286
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:06,100
so they don't give everybody chicken pox.

287
00:17:06,555 --> 00:17:08,691
- Did you throw up?
- Yeah, a couple times.

288
00:17:10,258 --> 00:17:12,910
Apparently, that's what happens
when you drink a bottle of iodine.

289
00:17:14,655 --> 00:17:15,892
I need to get back to the house.

290
00:17:15,896 --> 00:17:17,363
I need to check on the livestock.

291
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:18,271
I need to check on the corn.

292
00:17:18,277 --> 00:17:19,120
I need to get out of here.

293
00:17:19,127 --> 00:17:22,333
- There's really nothing you
can do right now. - He's right.

294
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:25,570
- You need to stay.
- Yeah...

295
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:28,673
I'm really sick of being poked with
needles every ten minutes.

296
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:32,042
They'll be sorry when my
spider powers kick in.

297
00:17:37,688 --> 00:17:41,370
Well, you're still an idiot,
so that's a good sign.

298
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:42,481
Yeah.

299
00:17:44,678 --> 00:17:46,100
How bad is it?

300
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,410
Well, you're sleep deprived
like everyone else.

301
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:50,480
Bring the bandages to 102.

302
00:17:50,548 --> 00:17:52,850
No, I mean the radiation.

303
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:54,031
Am I dying?

304
00:17:54,037 --> 00:17:56,090
- Have you vomited?
- No. Should I?

305
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:59,303
- You just need some rest; go home.
- I'd like to.

306
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,551
When's the next flight to D.C?

307
00:18:01,557 --> 00:18:02,693
Dr. Green?

308
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:04,540
Oh, there are a lot of people waiting.

309
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:07,481
- If you could just... - I just want
to know what happened to my friend.

310
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:08,921
Scott Rennie.

311
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,001
It looks like he had a heart attack.

312
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:13,893
I'm sorry.

313
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,191
But...

314
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:31,972
So what if I have three queens,

315
00:18:31,975 --> 00:18:33,800
but I only have two jacks?

316
00:18:36,485 --> 00:18:39,120
- I'm out.
- I so bluffed you.

317
00:18:43,377 --> 00:18:45,271
- Skylar, are you still alive in there?
- Hey, what's up?

318
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:46,801
Sky, are you home?

319
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:49,090
- Hello?!
- Hey...
- Hey...

320
00:18:49,098 --> 00:18:49,890
- Dude, I'm starving.
- What's up?

321
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:53,241
- Oh, my God.
- What's he doing here?

322
00:18:53,246 --> 00:18:55,001
This is not how it looks.

323
00:18:55,545 --> 00:18:57,270
It sure looks how it looks.

324
00:18:59,048 --> 00:18:59,872
Skylar, wait.

325
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:01,200
That guy's a weirdo.

326
00:19:02,787 --> 00:19:04,623
I can't just sit around here all day.

327
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:05,952
We've got to find the sheriff and his men,

328
00:19:05,957 --> 00:19:10,462
- we've got to get the power back on.
- Okay, now you're going to
stay here as long as it takes.

329
00:19:10,728 --> 00:19:12,813
Now, don't make me take your pants with me.

330
00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:15,621
- I can run this town without my pants.
- It wouldn't be the first time.

331
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:17,202
- Huh.
- All right.

332
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,673
That's a story I never want to hear.

333
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:21,271
Sweetheart.

334
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,042
How are you feeling, honey?

335
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:24,823
My leg's a little sore, but...

336
00:19:25,135 --> 00:19:26,382
how's everything here?

337
00:19:26,428 --> 00:19:28,622
- Your father has the flu.
- It's nothing.

338
00:19:29,425 --> 00:19:30,862
Did you hear Mr. Rennie died?

339
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:32,232
It's terrible.

340
00:19:32,998 --> 00:19:33,890
I've been thinking,

341
00:19:34,218 --> 00:19:36,740
more than anything,
this town needs information.

342
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,241
We could organize a group of people.

343
00:19:39,248 --> 00:19:40,390
Send them out in every direction.

344
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:43,562
- I don't think anyone should be
leaving Jericho. - We have to.

345
00:19:44,088 --> 00:19:46,093
We can't just sit here in the dark.

346
00:19:46,128 --> 00:19:47,161
He's right.

347
00:19:48,486 --> 00:19:50,130
Makes us too vulnerable.

348
00:19:53,457 --> 00:19:56,601
Abrams, you and Crossfield are taking
the northern route

349
00:19:56,606 --> 00:19:59,452
up through Nebraska to the state police
barracks in Broken Bow.

350
00:19:59,455 --> 00:20:00,823
Well, I can go east to Topeka

351
00:20:00,827 --> 00:20:02,201
and connect with the state government.

352
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:03,962
Ridley can head west to Denver.

353
00:20:03,968 --> 00:20:06,140
Well, what's left of it.

354
00:20:06,148 --> 00:20:08,520
You'll probably run into a ring
of FEMA and EMS people

355
00:20:08,527 --> 00:20:10,140
before you even get
within sight of the city.

356
00:20:10,148 --> 00:20:11,081
See what they know.

357
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:12,042
What about you?

358
00:20:12,116 --> 00:20:13,861
He's going to Wichita with me.

359
00:20:14,236 --> 00:20:17,832
That's right, Emily and I are taking the
southern route to Wichita.

360
00:20:18,628 --> 00:20:21,233
Well, let's try to radio
back as much information

361
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:22,151
as possible along the way.

362
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:22,972
That's the plan.

363
00:20:22,978 --> 00:20:24,712
Hitting the major cities in each direction

364
00:20:24,715 --> 00:20:26,982
north, south, east and west.

365
00:20:27,257 --> 00:20:30,792
- The four horsemen of the apocalypse.
- Let's hope not.

366
00:20:34,385 --> 00:20:36,370
Nope, we've still got static.

367
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:37,923
Try pointing it east.

368
00:20:38,365 --> 00:20:39,170
We've got nothing,

369
00:20:39,178 --> 00:20:40,111
keep moving it.

370
00:20:40,517 --> 00:20:42,142
Nope, just static.

371
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:43,770
Just keep trying.

372
00:20:43,885 --> 00:20:44,792
Mary.

373
00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:48,642
Excuse me.

374
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:49,943
Mary.

375
00:20:54,568 --> 00:20:55,532
Man.

376
00:20:56,198 --> 00:20:57,403
Busy place.

377
00:20:58,037 --> 00:21:01,550
Yeah, although the service
isn't what it used to be.

378
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:02,811
What'll you have?

379
00:21:03,097 --> 00:21:03,662
Oh, my God.

380
00:21:03,857 --> 00:21:04,832
We've got something!

381
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:24,661
- Where'd it go?
- Come on, bring it back!

382
00:21:33,217 --> 00:21:34,202
We're losing the feed!

383
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:36,753
- Bring it back!
- Go back. We had something.

384
00:21:47,547 --> 00:21:48,820
Was that Korean?

385
00:21:49,128 --> 00:21:51,211
- Does anybody know?
- I think it was Chinese.

386
00:21:51,218 --> 00:21:52,192
It was Mandarin.

387
00:21:52,406 --> 00:21:54,222
The question is, were they just reporting it

388
00:21:54,228 --> 00:21:55,293
or were they behind it?

389
00:21:55,297 --> 00:21:56,602
Did Stanley say if there were any markings

390
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,901
- on the side of the tank?
- No.

391
00:21:57,908 --> 00:22:01,623
- I mean, maybe we're being invaded.
- Abrams and Crossfield are out.

392
00:22:01,918 --> 00:22:04,370
- They won't drive into a war zone.
- Yeah, well, I don't blame them.

393
00:22:04,496 --> 00:22:06,393
Look, why don't we put this plan
on hold right now?

394
00:22:06,398 --> 00:22:07,441
We saw one image;

395
00:22:07,598 --> 00:22:08,603
we'll probably see another one.

396
00:22:08,607 --> 00:22:10,672
Going out is more important
than ever, all right?

397
00:22:10,678 --> 00:22:11,653
If this country is at war,

398
00:22:11,655 --> 00:22:12,722
we need to know it.

399
00:22:16,275 --> 00:22:18,920
Okay, we have Los Angeles,
Seattle and Philadelphia.

400
00:22:19,057 --> 00:22:21,690
- What else did you see on the TV?
- I think Seattle's wrong.

401
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:24,372
- Okay. Uh, could it have been Portland?
- I don't think so.

402
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:28,030
Hey.

403
00:22:28,378 --> 00:22:30,942
- I understand you lost some of your men?
- Yeah.

404
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:33,101
Need a volunteer, I'm available.

405
00:22:33,326 --> 00:22:36,150
- Thanks, Mister...
- Hawkins.

406
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,002
Mr. Hawkins.

407
00:22:38,306 --> 00:22:40,443
- Do you have a family?
- Two kids.

408
00:22:40,446 --> 00:22:41,730
I think it's best if we stick to people

409
00:22:41,738 --> 00:22:43,192
who don't have families.

410
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,792
Hey. Em?

411
00:22:56,428 --> 00:23:00,613
Um, excuse me? Mr. Cale?

412
00:23:02,738 --> 00:23:04,391
Something's been bothering me.

413
00:23:06,086 --> 00:23:07,902
It's about Mr. Rennie's death.

414
00:23:10,236 --> 00:23:12,602
The mine was full of people from the clinic.

415
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:15,283
How come nobody called for a doctor?

416
00:23:16,738 --> 00:23:18,442
I don't want to talk about it.

417
00:23:20,047 --> 00:23:21,280
I know you're upset.

418
00:23:24,128 --> 00:23:25,230
But he was my friend, too.

419
00:23:25,236 --> 00:23:28,200
I... I worked with him for three years.

420
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:29,612
Hey, Shep?

421
00:23:29,947 --> 00:23:31,323
We're heading out for supplies.

422
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,352
Why don't you give us a hand?

423
00:23:37,627 --> 00:23:40,070
You know, this whole thing
has been pretty hard on Shep.

424
00:23:40,075 --> 00:23:42,321
He lost a good friend today.

425
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:44,532
We all did.

426
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:52,310
Emily?

427
00:24:00,896 --> 00:24:01,930
Talk to me.

428
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:03,980
Was it the broadcast?

429
00:24:03,986 --> 00:24:06,792
- Because we don't know
what any of it means.
- They got Wichita.

430
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:08,390
Roger is dead.

431
00:24:08,395 --> 00:24:11,151
- We don't know that.
- I saw it on the map.

432
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,950
- Your fiancé might have made it.
- How?

433
00:24:14,135 --> 00:24:16,782
What if his flight
got diverted to Des Moines?

434
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:18,722
Des Moines' gone.

435
00:24:19,515 --> 00:24:22,952
Emily, what if it was Omaha, huh? Or Tulsa.

436
00:24:23,197 --> 00:24:25,780
What if they set down in the middle of
a cornfield in Nebraska?

437
00:24:25,785 --> 00:24:26,970
He could be anywhere.

438
00:24:26,976 --> 00:24:28,923
Plane went down trying
to find a place to land.

439
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:32,892
- What if it exploded?
- Emily.
- What if he's dead?

440
00:24:33,448 --> 00:24:36,223
- He's gone, and I'm here with you.
- Emily.

441
00:24:36,227 --> 00:24:39,690
You were supposed to be the one
that was dead... not him.

442
00:24:40,536 --> 00:24:42,001
Just leave me alone, Jake.

443
00:24:43,837 --> 00:24:45,073
Go without me.

444
00:25:03,895 --> 00:25:05,083
They took everything.

445
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:07,421
Oh, Dale.

446
00:25:08,277 --> 00:25:09,320
Thank God.

447
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:12,383
I looked everywhere for you.

448
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:14,752
Are you all right?

449
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,380
I was so worried.

450
00:25:17,426 --> 00:25:19,482
- I was safe.
- Good.

451
00:25:20,506 --> 00:25:21,783
Gracie?

452
00:25:21,945 --> 00:25:23,781
Oh, what now?

453
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:25,790
Gracie?

454
00:25:26,086 --> 00:25:27,470
We're closed, Gail.

455
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:30,013
- I'm out of everything.
- That's why I'm here.

456
00:25:30,227 --> 00:25:32,540
Some of the folks at the shelter brought
some stuff back,

457
00:25:32,548 --> 00:25:33,613
and I thought you could use it.

458
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:34,991
It's one box.

459
00:25:35,316 --> 00:25:36,813
I'm out of business.

460
00:25:37,188 --> 00:25:39,671
My train shipment was supposed
to come through on Tuesday.

461
00:25:39,675 --> 00:25:41,551
Without a delivery,
these shelves are gonna stay

462
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:43,320
as empty as they are right now.

463
00:25:43,698 --> 00:25:45,710
I don't have a freezer anymore.

464
00:25:46,068 --> 00:25:51,861
- Most of this stuff is going
to go bad any minute now.
- I know. Food's going bad all over town.

465
00:25:53,755 --> 00:25:55,571
I need my shipment.

466
00:25:56,366 --> 00:25:59,073
But we don't know if we'll ever
get the power back on.

467
00:26:00,498 --> 00:26:01,891
Maybe we should cook it.

468
00:26:02,326 --> 00:26:05,223
- What?
- Yeah. Everything, all of it.

469
00:26:06,028 --> 00:26:08,112
As long as it's still good enough to eat.

470
00:26:27,155 --> 00:26:28,020
Are you okay?

471
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,492
If you call radiation poisoning okay.

472
00:26:33,745 --> 00:26:35,262
Were you out in the rain, too?

473
00:26:35,315 --> 00:26:36,722
Oh, heavens, no.

474
00:26:37,036 --> 00:26:40,410
I touched a building
when we came out of the shelter.

475
00:26:40,997 --> 00:26:41,820
Oh.

476
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:45,723
Look, you can stop pretending.

477
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,143
What do you mean?

478
00:26:48,636 --> 00:26:50,211
I audited your farm.

479
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:52,730
Why do you care?

480
00:26:54,995 --> 00:26:56,661
Maybe I'm a nicer person than you.

481
00:26:58,067 --> 00:26:58,902
Right.

482
00:27:00,696 --> 00:27:02,032
Were you in the rain?

483
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:04,572
Yeah, for about 20 minutes.

484
00:27:05,905 --> 00:27:08,730
- Well, you look pretty good.
- Thanks.

485
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:11,120
Try to work out.

486
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:20,753
Look, um... you know I think
I got the worst of it.

487
00:27:20,756 --> 00:27:22,752
So as long as I'm okay,

488
00:27:23,087 --> 00:27:24,492
you should be fine.

489
00:27:25,535 --> 00:27:26,643
You're really sweet.

490
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:33,133
- And you still owe the IRS $180,000.
- Yeah, I know.

491
00:27:59,915 --> 00:28:01,971
Every radio needs to be fully charged.

492
00:28:01,978 --> 00:28:04,052
We'll stay in contact as long as we can.

493
00:28:04,056 --> 00:28:07,053
Gray, the long-range ones are all charged.

494
00:28:07,056 --> 00:28:09,223
- They're in the storage unit.
- All right, thanks.

495
00:28:09,498 --> 00:28:10,531
Ridley, why don't you go

496
00:28:10,538 --> 00:28:12,303
pack up the Geiger counters and the flares?

497
00:28:12,305 --> 00:28:13,481
I'll meet you out there.

498
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:17,360
Gray, I just wanted to tell you

499
00:28:17,368 --> 00:28:19,110
how much I appreciate what you're doing.

500
00:28:20,405 --> 00:28:20,820
It's a gutsy move, and, uh,

501
00:28:20,988 --> 00:28:23,150
- the whole town thanks you.
- Yeah, thanks.

502
00:28:23,155 --> 00:28:25,402
What the hell happened out there?

503
00:28:25,776 --> 00:28:27,560
I've known Scott Rennie his whole life.

504
00:28:27,566 --> 00:28:28,602
He's strong as an ox.

505
00:28:28,608 --> 00:28:29,743
I just...

506
00:28:30,268 --> 00:28:31,852
I can't believe he's dead.

507
00:28:32,156 --> 00:28:33,650
He was a good man.

508
00:28:33,656 --> 00:28:37,870
- Heart attack at his age.
- Yeah, well, it wasn't a heart
attack that killed him.

509
00:28:38,408 --> 00:28:41,001
- What do you mean?
- It was poor planning.

510
00:28:41,657 --> 00:28:42,643
What are you talking about?

511
00:28:42,645 --> 00:28:45,382
What I'm saying is that none of this
would have happened

512
00:28:45,387 --> 00:28:47,191
if that clinic shelter had been maintained.

513
00:28:47,195 --> 00:28:49,262
- You have a lot of people to answer to.
- All right, that's enough.

514
00:28:49,266 --> 00:28:50,703
No, that's not nearly enough.

515
00:28:50,706 --> 00:28:52,912
I get back here,
there's gonna be an investigation.

516
00:28:52,918 --> 00:28:54,062
Hundreds of people could have died

517
00:28:54,068 --> 00:28:54,893
'cause you dropped the ball.

518
00:28:54,895 --> 00:28:58,550
- Why don't we talk about this in my office?
- You dropped the ball,
and it killed Scott Rennie.

519
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:00,473
In my office. Now.

520
00:29:10,355 --> 00:29:13,243
Right now these people need our leadership.

521
00:29:13,245 --> 00:29:15,672
I will not have you tearing this town apart.

522
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:17,213
And when all this is over,

523
00:29:17,217 --> 00:29:18,211
if you and I are still alive,

524
00:29:18,217 --> 00:29:19,960
you investigate your ass off.

525
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,682
In the meantime, if I hear any more
talk like that out of you,

526
00:29:22,685 --> 00:29:24,603
you and I are gonna have a problem.

527
00:29:25,207 --> 00:29:27,053
Do we understand each other?

528
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,391
- Where's Emily?
- She's not going.

529
00:30:06,826 --> 00:30:07,710
Good.

530
00:30:08,828 --> 00:30:11,412
- You're not going alone, are you?
- Yeah.

531
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:14,590
Don't give me that look.

532
00:30:14,596 --> 00:30:17,173
- What look?
- You know what look. That look.

533
00:30:17,177 --> 00:30:19,582
Hey, I told you 7,500 times

534
00:30:19,588 --> 00:30:21,070
I have watched you drive away

535
00:30:21,076 --> 00:30:22,942
not knowing if you were coming home.

536
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:24,741
I've earned a look.

537
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:27,281
I'm coming back.

538
00:30:32,556 --> 00:30:33,553
Let's go!

539
00:30:33,755 --> 00:30:34,661
Ridley?

540
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:39,282
Come on.

541
00:30:40,428 --> 00:30:41,571
Shep?

542
00:30:41,677 --> 00:30:43,230
Taking Ridley's place.

543
00:30:43,356 --> 00:30:44,341
Going to Denver.

544
00:30:45,227 --> 00:30:46,672
You don't have to do this.

545
00:30:47,348 --> 00:30:48,803
What about your family?

546
00:30:50,867 --> 00:30:52,083
I got to get out of here.

547
00:30:52,645 --> 00:30:54,051
Shep, you'll get past this.

548
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:55,721
Yeah?

549
00:31:19,027 --> 00:31:22,113
- Hey, Heather.
- Oh.

550
00:31:22,396 --> 00:31:25,821
- Shep left this for you.
- Thanks.

551
00:31:37,548 --> 00:31:38,491
"Dear Heather,

552
00:31:38,848 --> 00:31:41,281
"I want you to know the truth
about Scott Rennie.

553
00:31:41,678 --> 00:31:42,693
"It was my fault.

554
00:31:43,165 --> 00:31:44,833
"Gray wanted me to keep him quiet,

555
00:31:44,835 --> 00:31:46,092
"and his heart went out.

556
00:31:46,577 --> 00:31:49,133
"I should have called
for a doctor, but I was scared.

557
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:50,272
"I let him die.

558
00:31:51,006 --> 00:31:52,371
"I'll never forgive myself.

559
00:31:52,886 --> 00:31:54,131
"You were a good friend to Scott.

560
00:31:54,135 --> 00:31:56,042
"A better friend than I ever was.

561
00:31:57,156 --> 00:31:58,283
Shep."

562
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:18,190
Well, they should be about
50 miles out by now.

563
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,673
Jake, are you still reading me? Jake?

564
00:32:23,266 --> 00:32:24,422
I lost him.

565
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:27,512
Shep, are you there? Shep?

566
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:31,332
Eric, do me a favor.

567
00:32:32,547 --> 00:32:34,182
I missed that last one, Shep.

568
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,223
Can you say it again?

569
00:32:36,216 --> 00:32:37,492
Tell him I'm sorry.

570
00:32:39,617 --> 00:32:40,980
Tell the family I'm sorry.

571
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:43,581
You're breaking up, Shep.

572
00:32:43,618 --> 00:32:45,352
Hey, Gray, did you catch that?

573
00:32:45,948 --> 00:32:46,961
No.

574
00:32:48,086 --> 00:32:49,431
No, I didn't.

575
00:33:58,126 --> 00:34:02,360
- I don't know, that would make
about 45 miles. - Right, so,
in about an hour...

576
00:34:03,306 --> 00:34:06,573
- Jake, what are you doing back?
- You should be in Wichita by now.

577
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:09,542
- Smoky Hill Bridge is blocked.
- What is that?

578
00:34:10,318 --> 00:34:11,882
It's a flight data recorder.

579
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,370
- I thought they were supposed to be black.
- Well, where'd you get it?

580
00:34:14,556 --> 00:34:15,712
A couple of pilots used the highway

581
00:34:15,715 --> 00:34:17,843
as a landing strip with mixed results.

582
00:34:17,997 --> 00:34:20,643
- This is the only one I could get.
- Were there any survivors?

583
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:25,872
It was a commuter plane that didn't make it,

584
00:34:26,217 --> 00:34:28,000
a 757 that was empty.

585
00:34:28,455 --> 00:34:30,051
Well, where are they?

586
00:34:30,057 --> 00:34:31,142
Where'd they go?

587
00:34:33,086 --> 00:34:34,271
How do we listen to this?

588
00:34:34,277 --> 00:34:36,690
- Do you have that old reel-to-reel
laying around? - Yeah.

589
00:34:36,697 --> 00:34:37,820
Your father needs to hear this.

590
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:38,882
I'm going to go get him.

591
00:34:39,256 --> 00:34:42,602
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm a little freaked.

592
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:54,873
Dad's here.

593
00:34:56,738 --> 00:34:59,531
I've gone through most of this recording
from the plane that crashed.

594
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:01,863
This is the last 30 seconds or so.

595
00:35:01,946 --> 00:35:03,962
A lot of background noise. You can hear...

596
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:07,353
pilots from planes in the area
talking to each other.

597
00:35:08,556 --> 00:35:09,650
Wait.

598
00:35:10,128 --> 00:35:11,201
The kids.

599
00:35:11,217 --> 00:35:13,802
Oh, yeah. Come on, girls. Let's go.

600
00:35:25,936 --> 00:35:27,153
Is anyone on this frequency?

601
00:35:27,156 --> 00:35:28,771
There's no reply from ATCC!

602
00:35:29,017 --> 00:35:32,680
Please advise. Ray-27 in emergency descend,
need coordinates for approach.

603
00:35:33,936 --> 00:35:35,932
Give me full flaps; it's about to get bumpy.

604
00:35:35,937 --> 00:35:39,823
This is Chinook 116 heavy.
Missed our handoff to Kansas City ATCC.

605
00:35:39,826 --> 00:35:41,342
Does anyone read us? Over.

606
00:35:42,088 --> 00:35:44,723
Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6, reading you.

607
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,060
We're bingo fuel,

608
00:35:46,068 --> 00:35:47,832
lost all VFR heading out of Chicago.

609
00:35:47,837 --> 00:35:50,632
Tried all frequencies;
there's no one out there.

610
00:35:49,896 --> 00:35:51,050
What does that mean?

611
00:35:51,555 --> 00:35:53,282
They're out of gas and blind.

612
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:54,422
Guys, this is Primary 221.

613
00:35:54,425 --> 00:35:59,082
I've got a mushroom cloud 16 kilometers
in height somewhere northwest over Denver.

614
00:35:59,085 --> 00:36:01,352
I've got a visual on two separate plumes--

615
00:36:01,355 --> 00:36:04,402
one over in Kansas City and one
south somewhere in Texas.

616
00:36:04,407 --> 00:36:09,242
- Does anyone read ATC? - Negative.
There is no ATCC anymore, Chinook.

617
00:36:08,486 --> 00:36:10,480
He's saying there's no traffic control.

618
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:13,131
There's 10,000 planes with no place to land.

619
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,712
That's about a million people in the air.

620
00:36:15,887 --> 00:36:18,001
Whoa! Are those F-16s?

621
00:36:18,008 --> 00:36:19,420
Right. Do you have a visual?

622
00:36:19,425 --> 00:36:22,682
Affirm. Prime Missouri Guard.
131st out of Landburg.

623
00:36:22,786 --> 00:36:24,223
These guys are hauling ass somewhere.

624
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:26,752
Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6.

625
00:36:26,945 --> 00:36:28,480
We found a stretch of highway long enough.

626
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:30,070
Follow us in. Setting down

627
00:36:30,078 --> 00:36:32,131
On final approach, stand by.
Here we go.

628
00:36:32,528 --> 00:36:34,133
Flaps, I need more flaps.

629
00:36:34,957 --> 00:36:36,033
Losing it.

630
00:36:36,355 --> 00:36:37,572
I can't hold it.

631
00:36:37,845 --> 00:36:38,340
We're sliding here.

632
00:36:38,347 --> 00:36:41,511
- Pull up! Pull up!
- I can't...!

633
00:36:47,876 --> 00:36:50,292
Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6.

634
00:36:50,297 --> 00:36:52,281
We found a stretch of highway long enough.

635
00:36:56,568 --> 00:36:58,833
Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6.

636
00:36:58,836 --> 00:36:59,951
We found a...

637
00:37:01,576 --> 00:37:04,102
- Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6.
- Trans Shore...

638
00:37:04,106 --> 00:37:05,891
We found a stretch of highway long...

639
00:37:06,928 --> 00:37:08,160
Emily, come here.

640
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:13,871
- Roger was on Trans Shore 724, right?
- Yes.

641
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:14,790
Listen.

642
00:37:15,928 --> 00:37:18,481
- This is primary...
- Jake, what is this?
- Just listen.

643
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:20,591
My co-pilot's blind. Background chatter.

644
00:37:27,428 --> 00:37:30,773
- Chinook 116, this is Glen 5-6.
- This is Trans Shore 724.

645
00:37:30,776 --> 00:37:33,371
We've set down in a field,
GPS malfunctioned.

646
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:35,630
I think we're north of Kansas.
Minor injuries.

647
00:37:38,948 --> 00:37:42,202
He's alive. He's alive.

648
00:38:08,627 --> 00:38:09,763
Robert?

649
00:38:12,378 --> 00:38:15,071
There's, uh, music outside.

650
00:38:16,317 --> 00:38:18,933
- Yeah.
- Yeah, the party.

651
00:38:20,486 --> 00:38:22,763
Sounded like Sam Cooke from here, but, uh

652
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:25,230
there's a chance it could be Kenny Rogers.

653
00:38:25,918 --> 00:38:27,153
Oh, Lord.

654
00:38:29,288 --> 00:38:31,283
Robert, the kids would like to go.

655
00:38:35,058 --> 00:38:37,463
- To the party?
- Yes.

656
00:38:39,975 --> 00:38:41,141
We're not ready.

657
00:38:41,896 --> 00:38:43,343
- Robert.
- No.

658
00:38:44,015 --> 00:38:44,863
No.

659
00:39:39,688 --> 00:39:42,262
Well, I'm glad there was
enough food for everyone.

660
00:39:42,267 --> 00:39:45,422
I just wish someone would've said thank you.

661
00:40:03,436 --> 00:40:06,240
Oh, it looks delicious.

662
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:24,371
Thanks.

663
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:34,141
She looks so much better.

664
00:40:37,275 --> 00:40:38,841
You really made her happy.

665
00:40:40,345 --> 00:40:44,020
- I owed her.
- Well, I'd say this makes you even.

666
00:40:44,328 --> 00:40:45,921
Not even close.

667
00:40:57,025 --> 00:40:59,443
You haven't said two words all night.

668
00:41:02,336 --> 00:41:03,903
Just taking it all in.

669
00:41:04,687 --> 00:41:08,830
It might be a long time before
we see Jericho like this again.

670
00:42:16,655 --> 00:42:18,060
I got to go.

671
00:42:20,277 --> 00:42:21,732
What time is it?

672
00:42:22,897 --> 00:42:25,152
It's a little past midnight.

673
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:27,570
Do you really have to go?

674
00:42:30,098 --> 00:42:32,131
Yeah, I should probably go.
