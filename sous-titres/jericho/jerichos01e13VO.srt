1
00:00:00,222 --> 00:00:01,628
<i>Previously on Jericho.</i>

2
00:00:01,765 --> 00:00:03,775
So I hear you and I
are going to be partners now.

3
00:00:03,776 --> 00:00:04,818
Where'd you get that?

4
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:07,190
You're running the store,
you're going to need protection.

5
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,560
Don't make the same mistake
that Gracie made.

6
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:12,561
Or those people out there
are going to be putting

7
00:00:12,562 --> 00:00:14,364
flowers and candles
on the sidewalk for you.

8
00:00:16,144 --> 00:00:17,166
Who the hell is that?

9
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:25,834
Remember,
the gas tank on this thing

10
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:27,075
is on the left-hand side,

11
00:00:27,076 --> 00:00:29,047
so if somebody decides
to start shooting at you,

12
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:30,405
make sure it's not on that side.

13
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:31,590
Okay. Anything else?

14
00:00:37,283 --> 00:00:39,853
So, are we going to see you
for Thanksgiving?

15
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:42,657
Well, I think Mary and I
are going to spend it together.

16
00:00:42,658 --> 00:00:43,885
Well, you're always welcome.

17
00:00:43,886 --> 00:00:46,501
Thanks, but I don't want to put
you guys in an awkward position.

18
00:00:46,502 --> 00:00:49,311
You could have thought of that before
you moved in with your mistress

19
00:00:49,312 --> 00:00:50,642
and left your wife with us.

20
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,339
Some of them were on planes

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,842
that landed in the middle of nowhere.

22
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:56,796
They've been walking for weeks.

23
00:00:57,326 --> 00:00:58,868
They must have gone through hell.

24
00:00:59,113 --> 00:01:00,149
Oh, my God.

25
00:01:05,242 --> 00:01:06,243
Is it really you?

26
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,105
I need you to keep the kids
in the house for a while

27
00:01:09,106 --> 00:01:10,399
until I can sort something out.

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,697
Are we in danger, Robert?

29
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,534
You have moderate frostbite
on your toes and fingers.

30
00:01:15,535 --> 00:01:17,284
You need to keep them
clean and warm.

31
00:01:18,213 --> 00:01:19,459
Do you have a place to stay?

32
00:01:20,774 --> 00:01:22,306
Do you know anyone in Jericho?

33
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:26,161
Actually,

34
00:01:26,893 --> 00:01:27,897
I do.

35
00:01:38,103 --> 00:01:39,531
It's freezing in here, too.

36
00:01:40,187 --> 00:01:41,190
Mr. Bintner?

37
00:01:45,724 --> 00:01:46,804
Mr. Bintner?

38
00:01:52,089 --> 00:01:53,189
Joe?

39
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:20,391
The temperature dropped so fast.

40
00:02:24,326 --> 00:02:26,274
It's going to be a long winter.

41
00:02:26,303 --> 00:02:28,329
All right, everyone!
Everyone, please!

42
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:29,718
Please!

43
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,933
Right now,

44
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:33,267
we're using the generator
to power the town hall

45
00:02:33,268 --> 00:02:35,544
for three hours a day,
and the Med Center for six.

46
00:02:36,084 --> 00:02:38,727
And this is how much fuel we have,

47
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:41,081
and this is how much we need

48
00:02:41,082 --> 00:02:42,470
to get us through the winter.

49
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,978
At current levels of consumption,

50
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:47,833
we will be completely
out of gas and diesel

51
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,933
in two weeks.

52
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:51,354
I wonder when the dancing girls show up.

53
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:52,357
Stop.

54
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:55,782
There's a way of doing this without
scaring the crap out of everybody.

55
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:57,016
He was elected.

56
00:02:57,486 --> 00:02:58,895
Guess he's going to do it his way.

57
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:01,075
I'm going to need a hobby.

58
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:02,416
So here's what we're working on.

59
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:04,721
All right, we got
organized firewood crews...

60
00:03:04,846 --> 00:03:06,428
- Mr. Hawkins?
- Yeah.

61
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:08,454
There's a woman
in that group of refugees

62
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,750
that Bill is processing,
I think you should talk to her.

63
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:11,966
Why?

64
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:14,146
She said she used to be
a cop in Saint Louis.

65
00:03:15,014 --> 00:03:18,371
Especially with 53
new people among us,

66
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,763
we have got to start rethinking things,

67
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,442
fast,

68
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:24,198
or the people we lost last night

69
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,455
won't be the only casualties
of this coming winter.

70
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,970
What about the windmills?

71
00:03:28,086 --> 00:03:29,089
She's right.

72
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:31,095
Wind power.

73
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:33,372
We should be building windmills.

74
00:03:33,373 --> 00:03:34,385
Harry?

75
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:36,581
I think you all know Harry Carmichael,

76
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:38,317
our chief engineer
down at the mine.

77
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,175
We've been looking into wind turbines
for weeks now with Mayor Green.

78
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:43,818
But in order to build anything
that can be connected to the grid,

79
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:45,284
it's going to take time.

80
00:03:45,448 --> 00:03:47,590
Time I'm not sure we can afford.

81
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,895
- She's in here.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

82
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:03,351
Hello, Rob.

83
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:07,461
Any parts we don't have...

84
00:04:07,462 --> 00:04:09,815
we simply don't have
the maching capabilities.

85
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,397
What kind of parts?

86
00:04:11,764 --> 00:04:14,041
Mechanical governors to regulate output.

87
00:04:14,427 --> 00:04:17,166
With the EMP damage, we're figuring
out a lot of this from scratch.

88
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:20,041
- It's still a long way off.
- Black Jack Fairgrounds.

89
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:23,296
We walked through it
on our way back here.

90
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:24,865
It's become a trading post.

91
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:27,383
People from all over
the region are trading...

92
00:04:27,776 --> 00:04:29,443
food, information,

93
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:31,012
machine parts.

94
00:04:31,623 --> 00:04:32,800
They may have what we need.

95
00:04:32,803 --> 00:04:34,519
That's got to be a 200-mile drive.

96
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,246
That's a lot of gas for a "maybe."

97
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,234
If we can get one windmill working,

98
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:39,989
we'd save that much gas in a month.

99
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,346
If we get enough of them,
we could be off gas for good.

100
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:45,622
It might not be a bad idea

101
00:04:45,623 --> 00:04:47,677
to put a small party together
and go check it out.

102
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:50,407
Is anyone interested
in volunteering?

107
00:05:21,546 --> 00:05:22,896
I know it was you.

108
00:05:23,398 --> 00:05:24,980
- What?
- Those men that grabbed me.

109
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:27,777
They said that someone
on my team sold us all out.

110
00:05:28,897 --> 00:05:30,306
They said it was you.

111
00:05:31,136 --> 00:05:32,236
And you believe them?

112
00:05:32,237 --> 00:05:33,278
Tell me why I shouldn't.

113
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,821
Come on!
You're smart enough to know

114
00:05:34,822 --> 00:05:36,769
that they will say anything
to get you to talk.

115
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,422
Because you know
I owe you my life

116
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,926
as much as you owe me yours
and because you just...

117
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:45,822
You just punched me in the face,
and I didn't hit you back.

118
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:49,864
- Who else is here?
- No one.

119
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:54,687
Victor showed up
just after D-day.

120
00:05:55,246 --> 00:05:57,136
But he only made it
for a couple of hours.

121
00:05:57,137 --> 00:05:58,333
Did you kill him?

122
00:05:59,664 --> 00:06:01,111
It was the radiation...

123
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:02,635
from Denver.

124
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,960
No one else made it back here
to the rally point?

125
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:16,102
You going to tell me
how you got out of that room?

126
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,711
Three armed guys, cuffs.

127
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,910
Three guys and cuffs
keep you in that room?

128
00:06:21,856 --> 00:06:23,630
One of them got too close.

129
00:06:24,306 --> 00:06:25,830
Then there was only two.

130
00:06:26,312 --> 00:06:27,450
Two was easy.

131
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,800
From there,
I drove as fast as I could.

132
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:32,221
Saw the clouds
from D. C. and Baltimore.

133
00:06:32,588 --> 00:06:34,826
Ran out of gas in West Virginia.

134
00:06:35,366 --> 00:06:37,777
Went from refugee camp
to refugee camp

135
00:06:37,778 --> 00:06:39,240
however I could.

136
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:44,313
I'm glad you made it.

137
00:06:46,223 --> 00:06:47,670
You left me.

138
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,661
I know.

139
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,188
So what now?

140
00:06:55,751 --> 00:06:58,934
We caught wind of some raiding parties
at interchanges here and here.

141
00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:00,130
But if you're careful,

142
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:01,847
you should be safe
the rest of the way.

143
00:07:02,147 --> 00:07:04,616
Once you're at Black Jack,
watch your back.

144
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,333
Thieves?

145
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:08,822
It's not the thieves you got
to worry about, it's the guards.

146
00:07:08,823 --> 00:07:11,214
They've got a reputation
of being really ruthless.

147
00:07:11,446 --> 00:07:13,346
Without the cops
or the National Guard,

148
00:07:13,347 --> 00:07:15,448
it's the only way they
guaranteed it's safe enough

149
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:16,616
to keep commerce going there.

150
00:07:16,617 --> 00:07:19,335
You'd better take two or three
of the border patrol guys with you.

151
00:07:19,336 --> 00:07:21,378
Just in case you run
into any surprises.

152
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:22,439
I'm coming, too.

153
00:07:22,998 --> 00:07:24,108
Not a chance in hell.

154
00:07:24,185 --> 00:07:25,998
Would you know
a working mechanical governor

155
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:27,889
for a wind turbine
if you saw one?

156
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:33,967
I'm not taking
passengers out there.

157
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,002
Jake, Mr. Carmichael has a family.

158
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:40,565
I can help.

159
00:07:40,912 --> 00:07:42,340
You need me.

160
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:50,018
Mrs. Green?

161
00:07:50,963 --> 00:07:52,198
What?

162
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:56,501
Eric told me that
April's pregnant.

163
00:07:57,446 --> 00:07:58,584
I just...

164
00:07:59,616 --> 00:08:01,699
- If there's anything that I can do...
- Mary...

165
00:08:02,104 --> 00:08:04,091
I think you've done quite enough.

166
00:08:08,761 --> 00:08:11,635
Always got to be the first one
to jump in the fire, don't you?

167
00:08:11,636 --> 00:08:12,812
Somebody's got to go.

168
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,803
Yeah, well, just seems
that someone is always you.

169
00:08:16,806 --> 00:08:19,777
Gray's having a few bags of salt
packed up for us to trade.

170
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,456
Smart.

171
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:22,594
Who else is going?

172
00:08:22,863 --> 00:08:24,021
Apparently Heather.

173
00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:27,320
Gray thinks I should take
a couple of guys from border patrol.

174
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:28,342
That's it?

175
00:08:28,343 --> 00:08:30,233
I'm not so sure
pulling them off patrol

176
00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:32,239
just to watch my back
is such a good idea.

177
00:08:32,818 --> 00:08:35,615
Besides, only a handful of them
even know what they're doing.

178
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:37,699
You don't think
I can watch your back?

179
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,493
Why? You want to go?

180
00:08:40,284 --> 00:08:43,140
Look, you've already seen
what it's like out there. I just...

181
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,571
need to see it for myself.

182
00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:48,426
Besides, I'm unemployed.
I'm not obsolete.

183
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:50,992
Did you ask Mom?

184
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,349
Son, I am 59 years old.

185
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,339
I was mayor of this town
since the Carter administration.

186
00:08:57,563 --> 00:09:01,074
I'm a retired U. S. Army Ranger
and a combat veteran.

187
00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:03,361
Of course I asked your mother.

188
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,747
I could go downstairs and...

189
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:12,062
warm some water
for a bath for you.

190
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:32,724
I didn't think I was ever
going to finish this.

191
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:49,219
Hey, uh...
we have a guest.

192
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:52,247
This is Sarah.

193
00:10:10,325 --> 00:10:11,444
Hey, Dale?

194
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,865
Hey. What are you
doing back there?

195
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,157
Uh, inventory.

196
00:10:18,215 --> 00:10:19,353
Is it that bad?

197
00:10:20,105 --> 00:10:23,289
Well, Mr. Houghton just showed up
with Mrs. Leigh's cut of the produce.

198
00:10:23,578 --> 00:10:25,874
- What the hell is that?
- Yeah, exactly.

199
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,919
Well, did you point out
that it's rotten?

200
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:31,179
They're all screwing me.
Hardly anyone's honoring their deals.

201
00:10:32,047 --> 00:10:33,590
My dad used to have to deal with stuff

202
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,500
like this all the time
down at the salt mine.

203
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:37,584
- Well, how did he do it?
- He just...

204
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:40,246
did whatever it took
to keep things running.

205
00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:42,329
I'm not shutting this place down.

206
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,445
Actually,

207
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:47,461
I may have
good news about that.

208
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,873
But you might have
to take a little trip.

209
00:10:57,012 --> 00:10:58,382
I need to talk to you.

210
00:10:59,482 --> 00:11:00,504
All right.

211
00:11:01,373 --> 00:11:02,816
I shouldn't have sprung this on you.

212
00:11:02,817 --> 00:11:04,167
This is too weird...

213
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:06,057
What? What's weird?

214
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:12,774
I kissed you.

215
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:14,376
A month ago.

216
00:11:14,588 --> 00:11:15,881
And we haven't spoken since.

217
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:18,234
Generally, people speak
after something like that.

218
00:11:18,235 --> 00:11:19,546
I'm just going to...

219
00:11:20,453 --> 00:11:21,611
You know...

220
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,533
I know, I'm, uh...

221
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,427
- I'm sorry, really...
- You don't have to apologize.

222
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:31,508
I'm not upset.

223
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:34,205
I understand
why it happened.

224
00:11:34,784 --> 00:11:35,845
Look, I want to go

225
00:11:35,846 --> 00:11:38,431
because I think I can help get
this place back up on its feet.

226
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:40,572
That's it.
It's not a date.

227
00:11:41,807 --> 00:11:42,848
Mr. Mayor?

228
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:44,720
I'm not the mayor anymore, Dale.
What is it?

229
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:46,345
I need to come with you.

230
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:48,802
I want to take it all.

231
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:49,829
Trade it for something

232
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,133
I can actually use
to build this store up again.

233
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:53,378
Whatever I don't use,

234
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,275
I'll put towards
supplies the town needs.

235
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:58,379
You're just going to give it
away to the town for nothing?

236
00:11:58,688 --> 00:12:01,524
It's the right thing to do, isn't it?
I just want to help.

237
00:12:04,514 --> 00:12:05,536
Well,

238
00:12:05,537 --> 00:12:08,044
this is one hell of a crew
we're putting together here.

239
00:12:09,183 --> 00:12:10,418
All right.

240
00:12:15,086 --> 00:12:17,305
Yeah, we'll leave
first thing in the morning.

241
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:20,884
You just happen to know
someone who just...

242
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,372
happened to wander into town?

243
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:28,504
Look at me.

244
00:12:29,314 --> 00:12:31,089
I'm not going to lie to you.

245
00:12:31,745 --> 00:12:32,980
But I can't...

246
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:37,667
I can't tell you any more
than I already have.

247
00:12:38,802 --> 00:12:39,844
So she's a friend, okay?

248
00:12:39,845 --> 00:12:42,167
The last time you let someone
from that part of your life

249
00:12:42,168 --> 00:12:44,609
- into our home, it was 4 years ago.
- This is different.

250
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,189
Well, you couldn't tell me
who he was.

251
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:48,713
But you told me not to worry.

252
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:51,105
Two weeks later, you left.

253
00:12:51,106 --> 00:12:52,914
I didn't see you again
until two months ago.

254
00:12:52,915 --> 00:12:55,029
This is different.

255
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,582
Sam cried for weeks.

256
00:12:56,992 --> 00:12:58,247
I mean, he was four-years-old.

257
00:12:58,248 --> 00:13:00,274
He didn't understand why
you'd want to leave him.

258
00:13:01,921 --> 00:13:02,936
I just...

259
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,351
I don't know if I can watch him
go through that again.

260
00:13:47,972 --> 00:13:49,655
What is going on here?

261
00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:54,845
Come here.

262
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,839
What is this?

263
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:03,125
So I'm being watched.

264
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:04,963
By who?

265
00:14:04,964 --> 00:14:06,230
My guess...

266
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:07,914
The Old Man.

267
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:09,829
Why...?

268
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:16,054
You still have the package, don't you?

269
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:23,437
He's been coordinating
this thing from the beginning,

270
00:14:23,522 --> 00:14:24,974
feeding us information.

271
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:27,848
Why would he turn on us now?

272
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:28,929
I don't know.

273
00:14:29,593 --> 00:14:31,710
You still have
a way to reach him?

274
00:14:32,552 --> 00:14:33,563
And have you...

275
00:14:33,564 --> 00:14:35,827
told him that you
made contact with me yet?

276
00:14:35,904 --> 00:14:37,789
- Not yet.
- Then do it.

277
00:14:40,693 --> 00:14:41,727
You do it...

278
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:44,045
and you see what he says.

279
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,497
"Thieves will be strung up."

280
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,340
We need your guns.

281
00:15:29,937 --> 00:15:31,574
Pick them up on the way out.

282
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,927
Go ahead.

283
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,094
They're kidding about
the "strung up" thing, right?

284
00:16:01,048 --> 00:16:02,546
They don't mean that literally.

285
00:16:34,288 --> 00:16:36,574
Looks like everyone
checks in here at the main tent.

286
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:38,521
They try and match
buyers and sellers.

287
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:40,358
They gave me three
possibilities of sellers

288
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:42,102
that might have the part
for the windmill.

289
00:16:42,103 --> 00:16:43,106
It's like eBay.

290
00:16:48,226 --> 00:16:49,237
Not like eBay.

291
00:16:49,238 --> 00:16:50,472
All right, look, um...

292
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:53,763
see if you can find the governor,
I'm going to stick with Dale.

293
00:16:54,504 --> 00:16:55,662
See what he can trade for.

294
00:16:55,663 --> 00:16:57,717
Let's do this thing quick
then we're out of here.

295
00:17:01,193 --> 00:17:02,336
Morning.

296
00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:04,542
Good morning.

297
00:17:10,258 --> 00:17:12,714
Last night,
you fell asleep mid-sentence.

298
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,201
- I did?
- Yes, you did.

299
00:17:15,276 --> 00:17:18,087
Standing up right there
at the sink, shaving.

300
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,254
You were going to tell me
what you've seen out there and...

301
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,741
Roger, I...

302
00:17:26,149 --> 00:17:27,480
I don't want to push.

303
00:17:27,866 --> 00:17:31,088
I can't even imagine how awful
it was for you out there. I just...

304
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:32,188
A lot of it was.

305
00:17:33,943 --> 00:17:34,947
Listen.

306
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:37,378
If I tell you something,

307
00:17:37,879 --> 00:17:40,368
will you promise not to think...

308
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:42,529
I've lost it?

309
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,664
Of course.

310
00:17:45,554 --> 00:17:46,770
Out there...

311
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:49,992
I saw... something.

312
00:17:51,381 --> 00:17:53,542
I haven't told
anybody about it. I...

313
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:56,377
can't explain it.

314
00:17:58,326 --> 00:17:59,696
The thing is...

315
00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:03,246
it was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

316
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:08,244
From there I ended up
in a tent city outside of Lexington.

317
00:18:08,245 --> 00:18:10,424
So, what are they like?

318
00:18:10,867 --> 00:18:12,372
The camps?

319
00:18:13,374 --> 00:18:15,651
Each is, uh... different.

320
00:18:15,825 --> 00:18:18,044
Some are overcrowded, dangerous.

321
00:18:18,758 --> 00:18:19,838
Some are better run.

322
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,902
Did you see people
with radiation poisoning?

323
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:23,099
Some, yes.

324
00:18:23,234 --> 00:18:24,410
What do they look like?

325
00:18:24,602 --> 00:18:25,934
Lots of burns,

326
00:18:26,069 --> 00:18:27,979
tissue loss, some vomiting.

327
00:18:28,037 --> 00:18:29,213
Allie, Sam.

328
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:30,930
Upstairs.

329
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:39,882
How do you know my dad?

330
00:18:40,481 --> 00:18:41,985
We worked together.

331
00:18:42,738 --> 00:18:44,185
Do you know how
to play football?

332
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,561
Of course, I do.
Doesn't everybody?

333
00:18:48,468 --> 00:18:49,664
Not everybody.

334
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:51,728
Hey, Samuel, now.

335
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,371
Come on.

336
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:01,798
You know, these kids
have been through enough.

337
00:19:02,454 --> 00:19:03,940
I... I'm sorry.

338
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,757
Look, I don't know you.
I really don't want to.

339
00:19:07,124 --> 00:19:09,690
I know the kind of people
my husband works with.

340
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,372
No matter how close
the two of you are,

341
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:14,648
I don't need my kids
exposed to that world.

342
00:19:16,674 --> 00:19:19,761
I've been married to
this man a long time.

343
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,655
I got pretty good at reading
between the lines.

344
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,284
Thanks, Mary.

345
00:19:40,075 --> 00:19:43,181
Why don't you and I sit down
together and have a drink?

346
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,506
Hey, how much?

347
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,168
- Beg pardon?
- How much?

348
00:19:57,902 --> 00:19:59,001
How much for what?

349
00:20:00,024 --> 00:20:01,200
I don't know.

350
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:02,625
An hour?

351
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:05,692
An hour of what?

352
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,818
Wait, what?! No!

353
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:11,017
- How about a half hour?
- Is everything all right?

354
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:13,429
- I'm not a hooker, pal!
- Then what are you doing here?

355
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,622
All right, that's enough.

356
00:20:15,085 --> 00:20:16,763
That's enough, man.

357
00:20:18,114 --> 00:20:20,352
- Is there a problem here?
- Hey, no. No.

358
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:21,914
No problem. Everything's fine.

359
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,980
No kidding, buddy.

360
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:28,592
You don't want to mess with
the guards here, it gets ugly, fast.

361
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:29,611
Thanks for the help.

362
00:20:31,738 --> 00:20:32,753
Heather.

363
00:20:33,654 --> 00:20:35,229
Oh, my God, Ted.

364
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,785
I can't believe you're here.

365
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,122
Jake, this is Ted Lewis.

366
00:20:43,568 --> 00:20:45,362
We grew up together
over in New Bern.

367
00:20:45,749 --> 00:20:47,485
This is Russell and Mike.

368
00:20:47,486 --> 00:20:48,545
- Hey.
- Yeah, we met.

369
00:20:48,546 --> 00:20:49,820
I was so worried about you.

370
00:20:50,244 --> 00:20:52,693
We were going to send a party
to make contact with you guys,

371
00:20:52,694 --> 00:20:54,469
but the roads were
just so dangerous.

372
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:56,211
What are you guys doing here?

373
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,315
We're looking for parts
for a windmill generator.

374
00:20:58,316 --> 00:20:59,325
Unsuccessfully.

375
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,412
Hey, there's a guy
we deal with here...

376
00:21:02,413 --> 00:21:04,181
who doesn't always
report to the main tent,

377
00:21:04,182 --> 00:21:06,294
but sometimes he's got
those specialty items

378
00:21:06,295 --> 00:21:07,946
nobody else has.
You want to see him?

379
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:09,605
- Yeah, let's check it out.
- All right.

380
00:21:14,177 --> 00:21:16,410
Get this stuff out of here
before somebody sees it.

381
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:17,802
Why, what's wrong with it?

382
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:18,823
Nickel...

383
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:20,584
the silver stuff
is all alloyed with it.

384
00:21:20,588 --> 00:21:21,595
So?

385
00:21:21,596 --> 00:21:23,287
So nickel absorbs radioactivity.

386
00:21:23,288 --> 00:21:24,961
Stuff that's been looted
from hot zones

387
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:27,116
is making a lot of people sick.
No one wants it.

388
00:21:27,293 --> 00:21:28,992
This stuff was nowhere
near the fallout.

389
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:31,116
Look, kid,
if I can't sell it, I can't sell it.

390
00:21:31,117 --> 00:21:32,413
What do you want me to tell you?

391
00:21:32,853 --> 00:21:34,068
What else do you got?

392
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:36,133
So what does have value here?

393
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,484
Not much of what you got.

394
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,528
Check the board over there.

395
00:21:41,255 --> 00:21:42,335
Why salt?

396
00:21:42,721 --> 00:21:43,898
It's a preservative.

397
00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:45,480
An antibiotic.

398
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:49,126
You need 1,500 milligrams
of it a day to survive.

399
00:21:49,668 --> 00:21:52,350
The Romans actually
used it as currency.

400
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:54,376
Whole African empires

401
00:21:54,377 --> 00:21:56,816
were based on the control
and supply of it.

402
00:21:57,028 --> 00:21:58,745
Wars have been fought over salt.

403
00:21:59,314 --> 00:22:00,876
Food, medical supplies,

404
00:22:00,877 --> 00:22:03,442
a generator, all air-dropped,
all from China.

405
00:22:04,696 --> 00:22:05,713
What?

406
00:22:06,022 --> 00:22:07,276
Yeah, we got an airdrop, too.

407
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,074
The thing is...
it was from Germany.

408
00:22:10,884 --> 00:22:13,180
It's aid. It must be coming
from all over the world.

409
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,750
Well, if aid's coming
from all over the world then...

410
00:22:16,904 --> 00:22:18,177
who did this to us?

411
00:22:18,178 --> 00:22:19,663
A group of thugs a few weeks back,

412
00:22:19,664 --> 00:22:21,909
guys claiming to be
government contractors.

413
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:25,133
So the mayor thought
we should make security a priority.

414
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,684
He resigned his office and...

415
00:22:27,206 --> 00:22:30,271
appointed Sheriff Constantino
acting city manager.

416
00:22:30,922 --> 00:22:32,316
The contractors,
who were they?

417
00:22:33,433 --> 00:22:34,879
A security detail from a...

418
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:36,654
company called Ravenwood.

419
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,523
They came in looking for supplies.

420
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,848
A few of the shop owners resisted
and they got violent.

421
00:22:41,108 --> 00:22:42,918
They killed three,
they injured eight.

422
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:45,098
They drove off with
a truckload of our diesel.

423
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:46,911
But since then,

424
00:22:47,123 --> 00:22:49,111
the sheriff's managed to
keep control of things.

425
00:22:50,114 --> 00:22:52,159
Crime really isn't a
problem for us anymore.

426
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,490
How'd he manage that?

427
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,258
- What is this?
- The news.

428
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,821
Where does all this come from?

429
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:09,156
People pass through here
from all over.

430
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:11,606
Everyone brings
a little piece of the puzzle.

431
00:23:16,586 --> 00:23:18,419
Do you have
something to write on?

432
00:23:20,426 --> 00:23:22,413
You guys don't
get out much, do you?

433
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:26,152
It gets better.

434
00:23:40,525 --> 00:23:41,972
What are the stars for?

435
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,399
Capitals.

436
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,576
Of what?

437
00:23:46,235 --> 00:23:47,508
The federal government.

438
00:23:48,589 --> 00:23:50,016
Federal government? But...

439
00:23:51,406 --> 00:23:54,261
There are six stars up there.
Where's the president?

440
00:23:56,384 --> 00:23:57,503
Which one?

441
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:04,525
Six presidents, I...

442
00:24:05,085 --> 00:24:07,497
I don't understand.
Who's in charge of the military?

443
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:09,523
You're assuming
there's only one of those, too.

444
00:24:09,524 --> 00:24:10,700
All right, come on, let's go.

445
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:13,842
Isn't there a line of succession,
so there's only one successor?

446
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:14,944
The word is HHS.

447
00:24:14,945 --> 00:24:17,027
Secretary Charles is supposed
to be next in line,

448
00:24:17,028 --> 00:24:19,111
but there are five other guys
who seem to think

449
00:24:19,112 --> 00:24:20,423
the attacks changed the rules.

450
00:24:20,443 --> 00:24:23,433
Senator Morrisette in Oregon,
Senator Tomarchio in Wyoming...

451
00:24:23,664 --> 00:24:26,226
They're all staking a claim,
gathering support.

452
00:24:26,477 --> 00:24:28,889
Then what happens?
How do they figure out who's in charge?

453
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:30,586
Either they start making deals,

454
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:32,188
- compromise...
- Or?

455
00:24:33,052 --> 00:24:34,344
Or they fight.

456
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:38,087
Six bags of soybean seed,
and still it's...

457
00:24:38,367 --> 00:24:39,525
It's not enough.

458
00:24:40,065 --> 00:24:42,129
Maybe this whole thing
was a bad idea.

459
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,190
It's a start.

460
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,566
Dale, wait up.

461
00:24:51,444 --> 00:24:54,415
It'd be a lot easier for you
to close the store, wouldn't it?

462
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:57,560
But instead, you're out here
trying to keep it going.

463
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,446
I think Gracie
would be proud of you.

464
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:02,742
I think your mom would
be proud of you, too.

465
00:25:06,331 --> 00:25:09,071
When my mom died,
there was nothing I could do about it.

466
00:25:13,123 --> 00:25:15,013
But then after Mrs. Leigh...

467
00:25:18,524 --> 00:25:20,955
Mitchell Cafferty
is going to get his due

468
00:25:21,264 --> 00:25:23,425
whether Gray finds him or not.

469
00:25:24,138 --> 00:25:26,859
Sooner or later, he's going
to cross the wrong person.

470
00:25:27,302 --> 00:25:29,618
One of these days,
it's going to catch up with him.

471
00:25:33,514 --> 00:25:35,790
I don't like to drink
while I'm working.

472
00:25:39,495 --> 00:25:41,964
To be honest, I have
difficulty understanding

473
00:25:42,581 --> 00:25:44,761
how many ways I dislike you.

474
00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:47,752
You made a list?

475
00:25:48,485 --> 00:25:50,530
Mrs. Green, I don't think I...

476
00:25:50,613 --> 00:25:52,648
This will work a lot better
if you just sit there

477
00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:54,674
and listen to what
I have to say.

478
00:25:55,831 --> 00:25:58,802
What you and Eric
did to April was awful.

479
00:25:59,941 --> 00:26:01,832
But she's going
to get through this

480
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,436
because she is
one strong woman.

481
00:26:05,304 --> 00:26:07,176
But there's a baby on the way,

482
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,876
and it happens
to be my grandchild.

483
00:26:10,532 --> 00:26:13,214
And I intend to do
everything I can

484
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:15,664
to protect it from this world.

485
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,272
But what you've done,
I can't protect it from.

486
00:26:20,507 --> 00:26:22,359
You've divided the family.

487
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:25,755
And as hard as that child's
life was going to be,

488
00:26:25,756 --> 00:26:28,745
you have made it
so much more difficult.

489
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:33,009
I don't think that's something
I'll ever be able to forgive.

490
00:26:55,371 --> 00:26:57,937
When I was a kid,
my mom split on my dad and I.

491
00:26:58,072 --> 00:26:59,885
She left with the guy
she met in Denver...

492
00:26:59,886 --> 00:27:01,197
This isn't about you.

493
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:02,427
This will work a lot better

494
00:27:02,428 --> 00:27:04,954
if you just sit there
and listen to what I have to say.

495
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:08,350
I lay awake at night
terrified that I have

496
00:27:08,351 --> 00:27:10,549
put April in the same
position my dad was in...

497
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:13,288
Terrified that I have put this child

498
00:27:13,443 --> 00:27:15,719
in the same position that I was in.

499
00:27:18,092 --> 00:27:19,941
My mistake was falling
in love with your son,

500
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:21,951
I never should have let
it happen, but I did.

501
00:27:22,564 --> 00:27:25,035
I know the cost.
I know how wrong it is.

502
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:28,761
But the problem is,
he loves me, too.

503
00:27:29,803 --> 00:27:31,335
And I don't know
how you undo that.

504
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,793
So if you want
to go on hating me,

505
00:27:38,216 --> 00:27:39,640
if you never accept me...

506
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:43,406
I can't say as I blame you.

507
00:27:49,093 --> 00:27:50,526
So I went to find help.

508
00:27:52,021 --> 00:27:54,011
I was more messed up
than I thought.

509
00:27:54,926 --> 00:27:56,952
I wandered for days.

510
00:27:57,298 --> 00:27:58,620
Eventually...

511
00:27:59,634 --> 00:28:01,759
passed out in this... field.

512
00:28:02,797 --> 00:28:03,946
So there I was,

513
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,831
the middle of Nebraska

514
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,895
feeling like that was the place
I was going to die.

515
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,282
And then,
the strangest thing happened.

516
00:28:13,752 --> 00:28:16,174
There was a...
light in the sky.

517
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,015
A bright light with a...

518
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,708
ring around it.

519
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:22,376
I...

520
00:28:23,365 --> 00:28:25,478
went... towards it.

521
00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:28,406
Two miles later...

522
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:31,486
I stumbled into
the refugee camp.

523
00:28:34,414 --> 00:28:35,724
That light...

524
00:28:36,638 --> 00:28:38,195
saved my life.

525
00:28:49,308 --> 00:28:50,708
Been looking all over for you.

526
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:51,842
Did you find the part?

527
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:52,934
I think so.

528
00:28:53,841 --> 00:28:55,153
Did you see the news?

529
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:57,333
You looking to trade
for a mechanical governor?

530
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:00,111
Okay, let's talk trade.

531
00:29:02,827 --> 00:29:05,470
Eight bags of salt
at 35 pound per.

532
00:29:05,471 --> 00:29:06,743
Russell, what did they think?

533
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:08,595
That they're the first ones
to think of this?

534
00:29:08,596 --> 00:29:11,393
These parts are in high demand.
I'm not giving it away.

535
00:29:11,394 --> 00:29:13,878
- What more is it going to take?
- What more?

536
00:29:15,017 --> 00:29:16,772
I turned away a guy
just this morning,

537
00:29:16,773 --> 00:29:19,454
and he offered 80 gallons
of diesel for the thing.

538
00:29:22,714 --> 00:29:23,988
Listen...

539
00:29:24,682 --> 00:29:26,669
We have more salt
than you can imagine.

540
00:29:27,171 --> 00:29:29,216
We have the largest
salt mine for 400 miles

541
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:30,643
and we've got men to mine it.

542
00:29:30,817 --> 00:29:32,418
But if you ever want
to see any of it,

543
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:34,771
we need to make
this deal right now, today.

544
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:36,140
You understand?

545
00:29:40,964 --> 00:29:43,124
Okay, listen,
I'll vouch for him.

546
00:29:43,607 --> 00:29:45,131
All right?

547
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:50,584
All right.

548
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,147
We got a deal.

549
00:29:52,784 --> 00:29:55,060
Wait here. I'll go get it.

550
00:29:55,697 --> 00:29:57,586
These things aren't
easy to make, you know.

551
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,401
Not the good ones anyway.

552
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,819
Dad, this is Russell.

553
00:30:03,954 --> 00:30:05,902
Hi. Good to meet you.

554
00:30:24,673 --> 00:30:25,869
Mr. Mayor?

555
00:30:25,946 --> 00:30:28,358
No kidding, Dale,
I am not the mayor anymore.

556
00:30:30,711 --> 00:30:32,255
There's blood on them.

557
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:38,293
- You need some help there?
- What the hell is this?

558
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:41,514
Are you conducting an inspection
or are we doing a deal?

559
00:30:41,515 --> 00:30:42,922
No, we're not supporting that.

560
00:30:42,923 --> 00:30:44,193
We'll find another solution.

561
00:30:44,194 --> 00:30:45,923
Well, then we're all done here,
aren't we?

562
00:30:45,924 --> 00:30:47,280
Why don't you get out?

563
00:30:48,418 --> 00:30:49,421
Get out of here.

564
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:50,772
Get out!

565
00:30:51,196 --> 00:30:52,276
Get out!

566
00:30:52,913 --> 00:30:54,341
Get out!

567
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:56,984
You, too!

568
00:30:57,061 --> 00:30:58,894
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

569
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,389
Guys, I'm so sorry.
We had no idea.

570
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,390
We need that part.

571
00:31:02,391 --> 00:31:04,997
- And we're going to have to figure out
a way... - Where's Dale?

572
00:31:08,141 --> 00:31:10,936
Dale, where'd you get off to?
Don't just wander off like that.

573
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,252
Did you steal that?

574
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,236
He's a bad guy.
He can't get away with that.

575
00:31:17,237 --> 00:31:19,563
We got to get that back before
they realize it's missing.

576
00:31:19,564 --> 00:31:21,411
It's okay I went out
the back. No one saw me.

577
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:22,429
Hold it!

578
00:31:22,995 --> 00:31:23,995
Hold it!

579
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:25,449
Hold it!

580
00:31:33,488 --> 00:31:34,550
Hand him over.

581
00:31:35,216 --> 00:31:36,784
He made a mistake, all right?

582
00:31:36,785 --> 00:31:37,994
He'll give back what he took.

583
00:31:37,995 --> 00:31:40,279
It's no harm done, all right?

584
00:31:45,724 --> 00:31:47,032
Excuse me. You know,

585
00:31:47,033 --> 00:31:48,403
he really is sorry and

586
00:31:48,404 --> 00:31:50,033
the property is back
where it belongs.

587
00:31:50,144 --> 00:31:51,638
He can explain it to management.

588
00:31:51,687 --> 00:31:53,947
I'm just asking you,
use a little discretion,

589
00:31:53,948 --> 00:31:55,043
that's all, please.

590
00:31:56,907 --> 00:31:59,352
Excuse me, but could I talk
to whoever's in charge here?

591
00:31:59,353 --> 00:32:00,796
Look, old man, I told you...

592
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:13,341
That's enough!

593
00:32:29,332 --> 00:32:31,208
How long have you been
with the FBI?

594
00:32:31,653 --> 00:32:32,974
14 years.

595
00:32:33,048 --> 00:32:34,616
Started right out of college.

596
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,641
It's dangerous out there, isn't it?

597
00:32:37,048 --> 00:32:39,666
I don't think your mom wants me
talking to you about that.

598
00:32:39,727 --> 00:32:40,839
I'm not a kid.

599
00:32:41,469 --> 00:32:42,716
It's pretty bad.

600
00:32:44,752 --> 00:32:46,481
My dad's been teaching me
how to shoot.

601
00:32:46,555 --> 00:32:47,666
I wonder if that's why.

602
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:49,170
He's been teaching you
how to shoot?

603
00:32:49,171 --> 00:32:50,182
A little.

604
00:32:50,662 --> 00:32:51,872
I'm not sure if I like it.

605
00:32:52,045 --> 00:32:53,403
It's a weird feeling, but...

606
00:32:54,094 --> 00:32:55,511
it's the first time I can remember

607
00:32:55,512 --> 00:32:57,611
the two of us actually doing
something together.

608
00:33:01,364 --> 00:33:02,685
Where's your father?

609
00:33:03,636 --> 00:33:05,031
It's the old man.

610
00:33:06,191 --> 00:33:08,401
He's coming for us,
using us against each other.

611
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,982
He knows where you are.

612
00:33:10,204 --> 00:33:12,093
We need to go.
We need to move now.

613
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,165
No, I don't know.

614
00:33:13,251 --> 00:33:14,412
You don't know?

615
00:33:15,215 --> 00:33:17,635
This country is going
to be what we make of it.

616
00:33:17,907 --> 00:33:19,598
There are only a
handful of other people

617
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:21,031
that know what we know.

618
00:33:21,636 --> 00:33:24,328
We have to keep fighting.
We have to stay alive.

619
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:29,277
We go see him, and if,
if he is behind this,

620
00:33:29,363 --> 00:33:30,475
we take him out.

621
00:33:30,894 --> 00:33:32,042
Take him out?

622
00:33:32,141 --> 00:33:33,821
Yeah, I mean,
how long can we run?

623
00:33:33,882 --> 00:33:36,167
How long can my family run?

624
00:33:37,995 --> 00:33:39,254
We pay him a visit,

625
00:33:39,255 --> 00:33:40,501
we eliminate the threat.

626
00:33:40,502 --> 00:33:43,403
We go straight at him, there is
a chance we don't come back.

627
00:33:52,368 --> 00:33:53,837
You're leaving.

628
00:33:55,505 --> 00:33:58,159
She walked in that door,
I knew right away you'd be leaving.

629
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,556
You have nothing to worry about.

630
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,840
It's not me that
I'm worried about.

631
00:34:06,988 --> 00:34:08,778
Our children need a father.

632
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:13,169
Whatever you're going to do,
it can't be more important than that.

633
00:34:16,543 --> 00:34:17,864
Do you trust her?

634
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,211
I have to.

635
00:34:24,553 --> 00:34:26,504
If she's a threat to this
family's safety,

636
00:34:27,825 --> 00:34:29,196
if she's a threat to you...

637
00:34:30,208 --> 00:34:31,319
you kill her.

638
00:34:33,715 --> 00:34:34,815
You understand?

639
00:34:49,154 --> 00:34:50,189
Get in!

640
00:34:50,309 --> 00:34:51,328
Hurry!

641
00:35:04,463 --> 00:35:05,520
Stop the car.

642
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,650
Jake, this car will not fit
through that barricade.

643
00:35:08,946 --> 00:35:10,329
Stop the car now!

644
00:35:29,701 --> 00:35:31,052
Thanks. I, uh,

645
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,833
I don't know how this would have
turned out if it weren't for you guys.

646
00:35:34,834 --> 00:35:37,434
- Well, you'll make it up to us someday.
- However we can help.

647
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:39,844
Those windmills you're looking
to build... I was thinking.

648
00:35:39,845 --> 00:35:41,601
Guys down at the
old brake assembly,

649
00:35:41,602 --> 00:35:43,414
maybe they can convert
part of their plant,

650
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:44,726
help build what you need.

651
00:35:44,784 --> 00:35:46,906
I know the town could use
a good source of salt.

652
00:35:48,156 --> 00:35:50,452
Looks like we're going
to be seeing a lot of each other.

653
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:52,680
- Thanks again, guys. Take care.
- Thank you so much.

654
00:35:58,405 --> 00:35:59,485
What?

655
00:36:06,933 --> 00:36:08,477
Jake, I saw the governor.

656
00:36:08,573 --> 00:36:10,020
I saw how it's put together.

657
00:36:10,271 --> 00:36:11,486
I was talking to Ted,

658
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,399
and I think between the two of us,
we can help to make more of them,

659
00:36:15,036 --> 00:36:16,290
but I have to go with him.

660
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,937
- Go with them? Wait a minute.
- No, think about it.

661
00:36:20,034 --> 00:36:22,580
We don't have the resources
to do this the right way.

662
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,831
They've got the machines

663
00:36:23,832 --> 00:36:25,396
and the guys who
know how to use them.

664
00:36:25,397 --> 00:36:28,207
With a dozen full-sized windmills,
you could power the whole town,

665
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,277
run the med center,
forget about gas.

666
00:36:30,278 --> 00:36:32,485
You're just going to leave?
Right now?

667
00:36:32,825 --> 00:36:34,215
It won't be for very long.

668
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:35,574
Just a few days.

669
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:37,629
But I know I can help.

670
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,328
I think I need to do this.

671
00:36:40,873 --> 00:36:42,464
You think this is a good idea?

672
00:36:45,306 --> 00:36:47,375
You know why things
didn't work out between us?

673
00:36:48,766 --> 00:36:50,156
I'm not dangerous.

674
00:36:51,268 --> 00:36:52,458
I'm crossword puzzles

675
00:36:52,459 --> 00:36:54,774
and flannel pajamas and
the occasional lite beer.

676
00:36:54,775 --> 00:36:56,798
I was never going to be
hazardous to you.

677
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,943
- That's how you tick.
- No, it isn't.

678
00:36:59,252 --> 00:37:00,596
Of course it is.

679
00:37:01,075 --> 00:37:02,095
But it's okay.

680
00:37:02,406 --> 00:37:05,187
If it wasn't, your dad would
probably be dead right now,

681
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:08,523
you and I would have
never met on that bus.

682
00:37:09,217 --> 00:37:10,761
So I'm taking a page out of your book.

683
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,092
I'm throwing caution to the wind.

684
00:37:12,093 --> 00:37:14,870
I'm gonna help turn the lights
on for everyone back home.

685
00:37:17,513 --> 00:37:19,211
Just for a few days.

686
00:37:21,353 --> 00:37:22,935
You worried about me?

687
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,047
Come back in one piece.

688
00:38:05,812 --> 00:38:06,815
Dad?

689
00:38:07,155 --> 00:38:08,606
We're out of the good toothpaste.

690
00:38:08,668 --> 00:38:12,017
Oh, well, here's the...
The new stuff that Mr. Daley made.

691
00:38:13,311 --> 00:38:15,765
- This isn't toothpaste.
- Yeah, it is.

692
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,694
Are you playing a joke on me?

693
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,923
Hey, you know, uh,

694
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,349
when you were teething,
you never cried.

695
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,896
See, 'cause most babies,

696
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,810
they cry, but not you.

697
00:38:31,597 --> 00:38:32,817
And your...

698
00:38:33,002 --> 00:38:36,305
mom was worried and the...
doctors were worried,

699
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:38,404
but not me.

700
00:38:39,377 --> 00:38:41,584
Because I knew you weren't sick,

701
00:38:42,494 --> 00:38:44,052
you weren't hurt,

702
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:45,673
you were just brave.

703
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:48,699
'Cause you're
the bravest person I know.

704
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:50,782
You always have been.

705
00:38:52,095 --> 00:38:53,098
Dad?

706
00:38:54,154 --> 00:38:56,006
What are you talking about?

707
00:38:57,734 --> 00:38:58,784
Sam,

708
00:39:01,145 --> 00:39:02,766
I have to go to work tomorrow.

709
00:39:03,337 --> 00:39:05,590
It's a very important meeting,
but it's quite far away,

710
00:39:05,591 --> 00:39:07,241
so I might not be back
for a day or two,

711
00:39:07,242 --> 00:39:08,785
and I just wanted you to know that.

712
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,407
Are you mad at me?

713
00:39:12,295 --> 00:39:13,303
What?

714
00:39:14,098 --> 00:39:15,123
You're leaving.

715
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,049
You listen to me.

716
00:39:24,777 --> 00:39:26,000
There is nothing that

717
00:39:26,121 --> 00:39:27,442
you, your sister or your mother

718
00:39:27,443 --> 00:39:29,727
could ever do that would
make me want to leave you.

719
00:39:31,925 --> 00:39:32,987
I, uh...

720
00:39:35,678 --> 00:39:38,148
I, I love you.
You understand that, right?

721
00:40:20,415 --> 00:40:22,119
Hey, welcome home.

722
00:40:22,884 --> 00:40:24,008
Success?

723
00:40:24,749 --> 00:40:26,907
- You get the part?
- We had it...

724
00:40:27,586 --> 00:40:28,636
and we lost it.

725
00:40:29,303 --> 00:40:30,735
Uh, where's Heather?

726
00:40:31,227 --> 00:40:32,807
Getting the lights back on.

727
00:40:33,227 --> 00:40:35,190
You do realize that
what happened today

728
00:40:35,191 --> 00:40:36,499
was unnecessary?

729
00:40:38,006 --> 00:40:39,092
And stupid?

730
00:40:39,784 --> 00:40:41,356
You got a lot
of responsibility now.

731
00:40:41,357 --> 00:40:43,244
You're going to have to learn
how to be smart.

732
00:40:43,245 --> 00:40:44,254
I understand.

733
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,155
And you,
you knew that this car

734
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:50,791
was not going to fit
through that gate?

735
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,377
I know.

736
00:40:52,932 --> 00:40:55,132
I heard you talking to me,
and I knew you were right.

737
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,579
Why didn't you stop the car?

738
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:58,489
I don't know.

739
00:41:00,128 --> 00:41:01,459
What'd you get?

740
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,003
Look at all this stuff.

741
00:41:06,282 --> 00:41:07,652
Oh, you did great.

742
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,388
This is nothing.

743
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:12,452
Skylar, how much of the salt mine
does your family own?

744
00:41:13,089 --> 00:41:14,652
I don't know. Why?

745
00:41:15,886 --> 00:41:17,835
'Cause I think we may be rich.

746
00:41:21,405 --> 00:41:22,813
You okay?

747
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,373
Look, uh...

748
00:41:30,974 --> 00:41:32,942
I am glad you made it.

749
00:41:34,698 --> 00:41:37,052
We leave first thing
in the morning.

750
00:42:21,467 --> 00:42:25,152
