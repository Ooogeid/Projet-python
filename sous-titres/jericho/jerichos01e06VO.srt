1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,660
previously on jericho

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:05,960
O: All right,it looks like the explosion came from the west,maybe denver.

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,200
If it was an attack and there's chaos out there

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,270
you might not want the wrong people knowing that jericho is still here.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,690
Johnston: The unfortunate truth is,there was another explosion in atlanta.

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,780
So,do we have a plan?

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,490
I will talk to april.

8
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,280
Tonight.

9
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,730
Secrets of a small town.

10
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,580
Divorce papers.

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,940
I had them drawn up before the bombs went off.

12
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,020
I don't want it.

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,530
The train that never showed up-- smashed into a car.

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,140
There's a ton of food just sitting on it.

15
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,180
If I knew anything I would tell your mayor.

16
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,580
hello.

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,290
This assistant secretary walsh from the department of homeland security.

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,490
Stay where you are.

19
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,360
Do not attempt to leave.

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,580
what's going on?

21
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,230
All right,everybody calm down,all right?

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,110
We'll have it back in a second.

23
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,380
are those ours or theirs?

24
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,390
They're headed up.

25
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,790
They must be ours.

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,620
Nearest missile silo's in wyoming,100 miles away.

27
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,990
So this is it?

28
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,650
We're at war?

29
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,140
enter psw

30
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,660
what's the target?
ours ot theirs

31
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,610
i'm compromised

32
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,000
Dad?

33
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:21,730
Hey,I want you to get your mom and samuel down here,and you wait for me until I come out.

34
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,280
What are you...
no,now,baby,now.

35
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,380
Well,if we're sending missiles,they must have figured out who attacked us.

36
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,660
God bless america.

37
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,990
Could have just decided to take out one of the usual suspects.

38
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,470
Which means there could be more missiles headed in our direction.

39
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,310
Well,is this the federal response we've all been waiting for?

40
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,020
end transmission

41
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,170
robert,the circuit breaker wasn't the breaker.

42
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,920
It was an emp.

43
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,020
It's an electromagnetic pulse.

44
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,380
Fries anything with a circuit board.

45
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:24,410
That means all electronics,appliances,anything with wires.

46
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,160
Does that mean another bomb has gone off somewhere?

47
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,340
What the hell was that?

48
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,610
Jake: It was an emp.

49
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,550
Everything's dead.

50
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,050
Well,is help on its way or not?

51
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,080
I don't think so.

2 weeks later

55
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,120
oh,dude!

56
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,000
Slow down.

57
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,140
What's the matter with you,huh?

58
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,710
Dale,hey,whoa,whoa,whoa.

59
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,410
What are you doing?

60
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,770
He broke our window,you saw him.

61
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,010
Dale.

62
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,660
Thanks a lot.

63
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,960
Dale,hold up.

64
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,070
What?

65
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,440
You all right?

66
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,850
They tried to break into the store twice this week.

67
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,930
Oh,that's terrible.

68
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,310
You got a problem?
Not me.

69
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,630
Dale's my buddy.

70
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,330
Right,dale?

71
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,210
You can't go around shoving people in the street,all right?

72
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,390
If you got a problem,you take it up with jimmy or bill.

73
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,590
All they'll do is write a report.

74
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,680
All right,well,then,come to me.

75
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,800
I can take care of myself.

76
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,850
There's got to be an easier way.

77
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,820
Maybe we can rig up the washing machine to work with the hand crank or something?

78
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,780
I'll be back tonight.

79
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,740
Where are you going,dad?

80
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,110
To the station.

81
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,330
So why you heading off to play cop?

82
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,610
Because people are starting to react to the fact that no one is coming to save them.

83
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,640
Okay?No one.

84
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,860
Because the world we knew does not exist anymore.

85
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:51,800
So if we can't keep order,we will not survivE.

86
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,980
Alison,give me a minute with your father.

87
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,610
Mom,I just...
now.

88
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,790
What the hell are you doing scaring our kids about the end of the world,robert?

89
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,400
Well,they have to understand what's going on.

90
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,400
You haven't been around for four years.

91
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,670
I'm the parent here,okay?

92
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,320
I'll decide what they need.

93
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,760
We cannot have photos up.

94
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,540
They might raise questions about us as a family.

95
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm not in this.

96
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,270
Get rid of them,darcy.

97
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,070
People are trespassing on my land.

98
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,650
Well,we don't have the resources to control the whole town,carla.

99
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,020
You have to keep an eye on your own properties.

100
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,310
Our street's got a busted water main.My whole front lawn is flooded.

101
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,280
I'm trying to get some men on that right now.
Where's mayor green?

102
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,780
He is home recuperating from the flu.

103
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,120
Then who's running this town?

104
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:55,570
The mayor is still in charge,and,you know,these guys are doing the best job they can with a short staff.

105
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,640
Who the hell are you?

106
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,460
He is a volunteer and a deputy.

107
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,770
Now settle down and we'll get to you.

108
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,900
But you have to be patient.

109
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,180
Please.

110
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,990
Mary: How's your brother?

111
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,160
Eric pretty much keeps to himself.

112
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,280
Spends a lot of time at work making sure the town stays on its feet.

113
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,790
Really?

114
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,710
That's odd.

115
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,690
I just figured he'd be spending a little more time with his wife.

116
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,380
You know,now that they've lost the house and all.

117
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,730
They seem pretty happy together.

118
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,250
Man: Mitchell,wait up.

119
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,520
Looking good,mary.

120
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,640
We are not doing this again,mitch.

121
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,680
You're not welcome here.

122
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,910
Oh,come on,with everything that's happened,I'm just looking for a cold beer.

123
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,600
Well,we haven't served cold anything in a long time.

124
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,000
All right,just give me whatever you got.

125
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,820
Or I'll get it myself.

126
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,450
You might want to rethink that.

127
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,620
Everyone thought you went up in the blast.

128
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,240
But I knew you'd find a way to survive.

129
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,310
Oh,come on,let's not do it like this.

130
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,870
Besides,anyone should have a grudge,it's me,right?

131
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,230
I mean,you left me holding the bad when you blew town.

132
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,130
You know what,you're right.

133
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,440
Don't make me kick your ass again.

134
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,650
Robert: HeY.

135
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,830
Is everything all right?

136
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,990
You travel with your own personal bodyguard now?

137
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,660
That's probably not a bad idea.

138
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,880
Robert: What's the trouble here?
Oh,no trouble.

139
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,020
We're just two old friends catching up.

140
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,160
Well,maybe you should do that some other place.

141
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,540
And some other time.

142
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,540
See you soon.

143
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,610
Hey,mom.
Hi.

144
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,760
What are you doing home?

145
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,080
I'm just snagging another citation ledger.

146
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,260
Taken more complaints these last few days than we normally do in a month.

147
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,410
Well,jake and I are going out to the ranch to feed the horses in a little bit.

148
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,540
If you'd like to join us,maybe we could talk.

149
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,890
I'm sorry,I can'T.

150
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,420
With dad down,I'm struggling just to make sure things don't fall apart out there.

151
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,190
How 'bout things closer to home?

152
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,420
What's that supposed to mean?

153
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,070
How are you and april doing?

154
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,250
Why,did she say something?

155
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,940
Eric...

156
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,880
how's johnston?

157
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,230
I wish I had better news.

158
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,360
His fever's getting worse.

159
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:42,110
I'll try to dig up a stronger course of antibiotics at the med center,but we're running low on supplies.

160
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,260
God,if I could just get him to ear something.

161
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,250
Can you stay?
Don't worry about me,mom.

162
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,390
There's a box protein bars at the station.I'll just grab one of those.

163
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,370
Okay.

164
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,610
If you wait ten minutes,maybe we could walk together?

165
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,000
I got to go.

166
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,910
There's an important meeting.

167
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,850
Then that's where you should be.

168
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,710
We'll talk tonight.

169
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,460
Maybe we can put in a new starter.

170
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,330
No one can find a starter that works.

171
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,600
uncle sam!

172
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,030
To what do we owe the pleasure?

173
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,870
Can you please not call me that?

174
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,930
what did she say?

175
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,380
Oh,she says she likes your shoes.

176
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,820
Thank you.

177
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,670
I have a proposition.

178
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,900
The hotel I was staying in closed,and since you owe the government more than...$180,000...

179
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,520
no one's heard from the government in weeks.

180
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,000
Consider me the government.

181
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,910
Fine,then I still get to call you uncle sam.

182
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,690
Nice watch.

183
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,630
It's a rolex.

184
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,440
You got the time?

185
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,170
It's,um...

186
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,550
it just stopped working after the pulse,just like everyone else'S.

187
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,660
Well,I how about I pay you when it starts up again?

188
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,250
You're being an idiot.

189
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,000
I am trying to give you a chance to protect your interests.

190
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,530
You're too kind.
Hey,here's the deal.

191
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:22,570
You let me stay here,and I will deduct my room and board from what you owe the irs.

192
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,190
Fine,fine,why not?

193
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,840
I can use an extra field hand,and you can help bonnie with the cooking and the washing.

194
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,220
Okay,maybe you don't understand the nature of a deal.

195
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,210
I don't do housework.

196
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,400
Is that a cockroach?

197
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,540
We don't have cockroaches here.
Well,it landed right on me!

198
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,310
It's probably attracted to all that chicken crap in the yard.

199
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,440
Stanley,what's wrong?

200
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,580
What do you got there?

201
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,350
Rap sheet on mitchell cafferty.

202
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,370
Armed robbery,assault,gun-trafficking.

203
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,900
Yeah.

204
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,410
Mitch isn't one of jericho's finest.

205
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,130
What do you know about him?

206
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,520
Well,he hasn't given us trouble in a while.

207
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,510
He stays on the edge of town in a sort of compound with a bunch of guys.

208
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,140
Like survivalists?
I guess.

209
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,130
Why are you so interested?

210
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,620
Well,he was in bailey's this morning.

211
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,720
Had some words with your brother.

212
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,890
Looked like there was a bit of history there.

213
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,970
What did jake do about it?

214
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,990
Kept his cool,didn't engage.

215
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,230
Well,it's best we leave it alone,then.

216
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,950
Like you said,it's history.

217
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,790
Well,one thing that hasn't changed...

218
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,780
all this.

219
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,840
You remember when you first started riding?

220
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,430
Took to it like a fish to water.

221
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,560
You know,if you'd favored your father a little less and your dinky uncle dennis a little more,you would've been a hell of a jockey.

222
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,550
Talk to me.

223
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,140
I'm tired of hearing my own voice.

224
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,730
You okay?

225
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,210
Yeah,just tired.

226
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,250
I'm gonna get the water.

227
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,410
mom!Stay down!

228
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,930
Who are those guys?

229
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,600
xxxxxxxxx

230
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,900
I'll get you some aspirin for the pain and swelling.

231
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,300
I'm sorry I can't offer anything stronger.

232
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,660
I-it's okay,honey.

233
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,910
I don't need anything else.

234
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,110
Don't argue with her,gail-- doctor's orders.

235
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,210
Damn bastards.

236
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,760
Jake?

237
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,200
Where are you going?

238
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,460
To find mitch.
And then what?

239
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,630
I don't know yet.

240
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,490
Well,hold on,jake,you don't know for sure if he's behind this.

241
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,460
It was him.

242
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,640
You said yourself you didn't get a good look.

243
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,010
Now,look...

244
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:23,870
you know,I would like nothing better than to string up the guys who did this,but that's not the way we do things.

245
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,800
Last time you got mixed up with mitch cafferty,you left town and a boy was dead.

246
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,040
I'm not that guy anymore.Yeah?

247
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,480
Let's just make sure that it stays that way.

248
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,030
Look,if I don't care of him,he'll come back.

249
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,020
We've got to do this right.
You know that...

250
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:43,920
if this family starts breaking the law,how are we supposed to enforce it?

251
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,080
Gracie,you still have those crop pesticides?

252
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,860
Everything I got left is right there on that shelf.

253
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,820
Thank god.I'm gonna need everything you got to protect my corn.

254
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,560
Can anyone even eat that corn?

255
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,560
What about that rain we had?
No,it's okay.

256
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,750
The husks kept it safe from the fallout.

257
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,550
It was already mature,so the ears didn't take up any of that moisture.

258
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,510
You sure about that?

259
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,160
Gracie,you think I'd let my sister eat it if I didn't ink it was safe?

260
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,320
You think i would?

261
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,080
After what I've been exposed to?

262
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,450
I'll give you 20 bushels for those pesticides.

263
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:28,590
Well,I was thinking we'd split the harvest,half and half.

264
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,390
Half?

265
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,060
What are you,crazy?

266
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,200
Well,how you gonna sell your corn?

267
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,860
Give it to me,I'll sell it here,and we'll share the profit.

268
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,100
Mimi: Richmond farm belongs to the U.S.Treasury.

269
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,290
You're lucky we just don't commandeer what we need.

270
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,020
I'd like to see you try.

271
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,110
All right,let's go.

272
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,610
Hey,jimmy.

273
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,560
Eric,what's up?

274
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,270
Hey,mary.

275
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,810
Where the hell have you been?

276
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,150
We think mitch cafferty and his cohorts stole some horses.

277
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:14,070
I know they were here earlier; I thought maybe you might have heard something.

278
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,950
Anything you might know,mary,would really help.

279
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,490
There was a man here this afternoon.

280
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,650
I heard him say that he bought a horse from some guys out at the airfield.

281
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,870
The airfield.
All right.

282
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,210
Thanks.

283
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,240
Thanks.

284
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,040
Eric.

285
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,760
The last time I saw you,you were gonna tell your wife about us and we were gonna start our life together.

286
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,220
That thought has kept me going.

287
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,280
That was nearly two weeks ago.

288
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,670
I don't know...

289
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,520
what you're thinking,I don't know if you're okay.

290
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,260
I don't know if I'm okay,mary.

291
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,840
I know this is not what I wanted.

292
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,530
Mary,I think about you every minute of every day.

293
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:01,010
Man,I wake up in the morning,and I want it to be you there so badly.

294
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,930
I know I...

295
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:08,840
I'm still married,and I have a wife,and I owe her...

296
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,860
something.

297
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,330
I don't know what to say,mary.

298
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:16,380
I wish I did,but I don'T.

299
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,760
It's like a damn infirmary in here.

300
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:56,190
Thought it'd be at least 20 years before it came to this.

301
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm hot!

302
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:02,030
I'll bet you didn't expect a house full of kids,either.

303
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,940
I'm worried about jake.

304
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,070
So am I.

305
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:17,450
I don't think I'll ever forget the night I got that call.

306
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:24,790
Went out there and saw that mitch cafferty in handcuffs,that other kid all covered in blood,and all I could think is...

307
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,210
one of those boys could've been jake.

308
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,880
oh,hi,stanley.
Hi.

309
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,450
Sorry to bother you,mrs.Green,mayor,but I,uh...

310
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,210
I need to talk to you.
What is it?

311
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,420
I found corn worms in my crop...

312
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:47,410
and I know this is a long shot,but I was hoping maybe you'd have some pesticides out at your ranch.

313
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,970
None of the other farms can spare 'em.

314
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,070
Sorry,stanley.Have you tried gracie's?

315
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,230
Yeah.She-she won't give 'em up.

316
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:01,390
You see,I need to kill these bugs,or I'd have to harvest what's good today,or it's-it's all gone.

317
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,140
Does she realize you have the biggest farm in jericho?

318
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,250
I mean,if we lose his crops,we all starve.

319
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,150
We're just gonna have to put together a crew as quick as we can,and we'll have to figure out how to ration it.

320
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,910
Stanley: Hang on a minute.

321
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,990
This is my corn.

322
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,730
Well,of course it is,stanley-- it's just right now we need you to share.

323
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,040
I mean,we're on our own here,and the town's nearly out of food.

324
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:25,160
Well,now,I'm willing to do my part,mayor,but I'm not giving up my crop.

325
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,760
Stanley,there'll be plenty enough for you and bonnie.

326
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,960
Plenty enough for everyone.

327
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:34,580
For 5,000 people plus livestock for god knows how many months?

328
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,740
I am not the only farm in this town.Why am I being targeted?

329
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,430
Stanley,nobody's being targeted.

330
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,130
It sure doesn't seem that way,sir-- all of a sudden everybody's laying claim to my crop-- the irs,gracie,and now you.

331
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,330
Stanley,we're just...

332
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,380
all due respect,I'll take care of it myself.

333
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,050
Oh,stanley,come and sit down,honey.

334
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,590
Stanley,come on back here,now.

335
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,620
hey,girl.

336
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,860
Jake.

337
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,540
Dale,what are you doing here?

338
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,900
I'm so sorry.I didn't know.

339
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,410
Didn't know what?
Jake!

340
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,560
jake?

341
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,550
You back away.

342
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,200
Get the hell out of here,dale.

343
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,120
No.

344
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:55,050
Stick around-- think of this as initiation.

345
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,910
You've crossed the line.

346
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,400
Excuse me?

347
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,530
You heard me.

348
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:04,480
Coming to our family's ranch.

349
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,140
I crossed the line?

350
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,550
I went to jail...

351
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,190
that night that you bailed on us.

352
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,650
My best friend...

353
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,010
had half of his head blown off.

354
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,920
I told you I wasn't gonna rob anybody.

355
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,420
Oh,come on,stop acting like an angel.

356
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,420
You come back to...settle down?

357
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,330
Raise a family,maybe do a little farming?

358
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,020
I never planned on staying.

359
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,790
Of course not.

360
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,770
But where you gonna go?

361
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,820
Cars don't work.

362
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,860
We're fresh out of horses.

363
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,840
Jake: If you...

364
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:44,610
or anybody ever come near my family again,I will kill you.

365
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,330
Now,that's the jake I know.

366
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,640
All right,now get uP.

367
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,820
I'm taking you to go see john.

368
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,420
stop!Sheriff!

369
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,110
Don't even move.

370
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,440
Where's mitchell?

371
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,740
Don't know.

372
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,480
I know you,sean.You're lying.

373
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,330
Dale?

374
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,500
You're next.

375
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,420
What am I gonna do about this?

376
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:02,270
Can't charge them with anything and the nearest judge is in the county seat and we don't even know if that exists anymore.

377
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,990
Is this about these kids?

378
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,490
Or mitchell cafferty?

379
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,030
He stole my mother's horses and he could have gotten her killed.

380
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:14,020
Oh,you had run-ins with this guy long before that,jake.

381
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,640
I've read his file.

382
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,100
He's gonna be a problem,right?

383
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:25,440
And now with the sheriff and half our deputies dead,mitchell and his kind are gonna prey on this town like locusts.

384
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,060
We need to stop them now.

385
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:31,530
Well,if it's information you want,first thing we do is separate them.

386
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,910
All right,I'll take sean into the hallway.

387
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,360
No.

388
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,850
I'll do it.

389
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,820
Get up.We're going for a walk.

390
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,940
Screw that,I don't have to...

391
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,760
Walk.

392
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,070
Some pesticides got stolen over at gracie'S.

393
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,060
Do you know anything about it?

394
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:12,900
No.I mean,I was there earlier trying to buy some,but...

395
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,520
but what?

396
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:21,130
All right.What's going on?Why are you acting like this?

397
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,570
Gracie came down to the station.

398
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,360
Started raising all kinds of hell.

399
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,110
She says you stole 'em.

400
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,750
She told you I stole them?

401
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,690
You mind if I take a look around?

402
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,870
Yeah,I do,bill.This is nuts!

403
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,580
What's going on?

404
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,310
I don't know.

405
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,610
One of my best friends is accusing me of stealing pesticides.

406
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,010
I'm gonna check the barn.

407
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,280
I didn't say you could go in there.

408
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,850
Watch it.

409
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,770
It's okay.Just let him do what he wants to do.

410
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,940
Fine,check the barn.

411
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,410
Check the whole damn house!

412
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:09,170
How you got mixed up with mitchell but you need to stay away from him.

413
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,910
I'm serious.You can wind up in jail or a lot worse.

414
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,940
How did you get mixed up with him?

415
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,250
I was stupid.

416
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,130
And bored and looking for trouble.

417
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,080
Are you looking for trouble?

418
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,510
Dale.

419
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,040
Why are they keeping you here?What'd you do?

420
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,890
I'm just talking to him.

421
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,700
You can't without an attorney.

422
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,870
I'm not a cop.
I'm bailing him out anyway.

423
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,330
I know the machines are down,but you have to take it.

424
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,680
Get out of here.

425
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,280
You're letting me go?

426
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:45,910
Jake: Yeah.

427
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,970
Just trying to talk some sense into you.

428
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:53,900
Believe me,you don't want to go down this road.

429
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,760
I think I know where mitchell is.

430
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,160
I'll show you.

431
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,440
dad?

432
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,510
Dad?

433
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,620
dad?

434
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,030
Come on,out of here.

435
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,040
Are all those cities gone?

436
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,650
What do you think?

437
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,890
How do you know?
I don't for sure.

438
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,340
Okay.

439
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:59,020
Those are the cities I heard about through the ham radio,and the satellite feed before the emp.

440
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,210
Home come your laptop wasn't fried like everything else?

441
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,640
It's ruggedized.

442
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,840
It is built to withstand an emp.

443
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,460
The,um...

444
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,370
the government issues them,baby.

445
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,210
So you're some kind of spy?

446
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,950
That's why you moved us here.

447
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,860
You knew this was gonna happen.

448
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,370
Why do you have that gun?What's it for?

449
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,910
Shooting.

450
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:34,280
And I think it's probably time you learned how.

451
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,400
You see,the way things are going...

452
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,540
you may have to defend yourself one day.

453
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,670
Do you understand?

454
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,380
Hey,what's going on?

455
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,930
We were just catching up.

456
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,630
Right?

457
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,000
You're clear.

458
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,780
Are you sure?

459
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,870
Because we can check the fields.We can go through them row by row.

460
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,890
We got a complaint.

461
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,520
So all you gotta do now is accuse someone?

462
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,460
Stanley.
No.

463
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,530
What about my word,bill?

464
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,300
I'm just doing my job,man.

465
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,440
Mimi: What are you doing?

466
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:33,130
I'm gonna burn the field.

467
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,550
You've completely lost your mind.What happened to you?

468
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,820
I'm not gonna burn the whole field,just the infested partS.

469
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,810
Oh,my god,stanley.

470
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,390
You don't need to do this.

471
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,560
Look,it's the only thing I can think of.

472
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,790
I got the pesticides.

473
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,450
What are you talking about?

474
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,060
I paid some kids to steal them from gracie's store.

475
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,250
We just have to get into town and pick them up.

476
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,520
You stole the pesticides?

477
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,110
What,am I talking to myself?

478
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,540
I paid someone to steal them.

479
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,950
I gave them my diamond watch.

480
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:06,360
I can't believe this is what we've come to.

481
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:09,040
We don't really have a choice,stanley.

482
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,810
It's every man for himself now.

483
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,740
He's finally asleep.
Great.

484
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:37,240
How are you feeling?

485
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:40,750
I'm hanging in there.

486
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:45,320
I'm sorry there isn't more I can do for him.

487
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:48,230
That's one obstinate guy in there.

488
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,800
I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

489
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,570
Certainly not as far as jake's concerned.

490
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:02,260
I don't know as I've ever really thought of eric as being stubborn.

491
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,950
Hard to reach,then?

492
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:08,310
Well,he's had a lot on his plate.

493
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,350
Since the missiles...

494
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,980
not to mention your new living arrangement.

495
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,330
Yeah.

496
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:19,040
It started long before all of this.

497
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,820
I've been where you are.

498
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,550
Putting something back together...

499
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,960
isn't ever easy.

500
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:37,400
But somebody's got to take the first step.

501
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:42,670
Now,if you want to fight for this thing,start fighting.

502
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,410
You need to be smarter about who you hang out with.

503
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,890
I don't hang out with those guys.

504
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,260
I needed sean and mitch to help me move some stuff,that's all.

505
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,610
I didn't know about the horses.

506
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,830
Well,what did you think,dale?

507
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,640
Hey,you never should have tried to protect them.

508
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,910
I wasn'T.I was trying to protect gracie.

509
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,020
What do you mean?

510
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:03,070
A train crashed full of food supplies.

511
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,110
It's how I've been keeping gracie stocked.

512
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,120
I didn't want anyone to know about it.

513
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,510
It's all in there.

514
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,020
What?

515
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,440
This place was full.It was stacked to the rafters.

516
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:35,290
I guess we know who took it.

517
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,670
Gracie.

518
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:42,160
You get the hell out of my store.I know you stole from me.

519
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,650
No,I didn't,gracie.I swear I didn'T.

520
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,910
Gracie,how long have you known me?

521
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:49,270
My whole life,right?

522
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,340
We have to trust each other.

523
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,470
Just,just,let me show you.

524
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,550
Follow me.

525
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,620
You see,gracie?It's all here.

526
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,410
Nobody stole anything from anyone,okay?

527
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,210
It was a misunderstanding.

528
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,890
Eric: Do you have any idea where he would have moved it to?

529
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,070
Dale: No,no,I don'T.

530
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,210
You stay here.

531
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,140
Stop right there,mitchell!

532
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,680
Put your gun down.

533
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,900
Put your gun down!

534
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,950
Now put your hands up.

535
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,740
where's the food?

536
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,890
Eric: Jake...

537
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:03,940
stop.

538
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,930
What are you doing?I said,"stop.

539
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:08,110
" Where's the food?

540
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,640
Stop!

541
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,060
So what are we doing to do about him?

542
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,090
Eric: We lock him up for now.

543
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,350
Maybe we can send someone to fielding,see if the courthouse is still running.

544
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,920
His friends aren't going to let this go.

545
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:24,810
I can handle it.

546
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,710
Yeah,you handled it real good back at the barn.

547
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,310
I should have killed him.
Stop it,jake!

548
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,660
You're not that guy anymore.

549
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,870
What about these two?

550
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,620
Eric: Now I can see letting dale go,but sean helped steal the horses.

551
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,300
He's still a boy.

552
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:43,930
A boy who could have gotten you killed,mom.

553
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,910
Well,it doesn't matter,eric,because I'm not pressing charges.

554
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:53,310
This cell is too small to hold everybody who ever made a mistake.

555
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:57,700
What do you suggest?

556
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,960
Rehabilitation.

557
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,730
Okay.

558
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,680
Okay,hold it.

559
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:11,860
All fingers wrapped.

560
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,580
Okay,relax.

561
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,740
Right.

562
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,230
It's okay.

563
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,290
Breathe.

564
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,310
Nice.Stand with your legs like so.

565
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,950
A little further apart.

566
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:21,870
Right.

567
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,300
Now bend your knees,take your sight.

568
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,610
Try to keep your eyes open.

569
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,350
Squeeze.

570
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:36,430
Right.Good job,good job.

571
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,680
All right.

572
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,030
That's a very good job.

573
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,150
You like that?

574
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,790
are you sure this is going to work?

575
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,230
In theorY.

576
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,260
You've never done this before?

577
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,650
Nope.

578
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,380
Well,don't get it on your shoes.

579
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,790
Seriously,get away from me.

580
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,830
Oh,my god,I wish I prayed.

581
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,490
Gail: Stanley.

582
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,440
you said you needed to harvest today.

583
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:19,840
We're here to help,no strings attached.

584
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,890
thanks.

585
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,960
mom.

586
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,100
Well,hello.

587
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,900
I'm really sorry,mrs.Green.

588
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,950
I'm sorry for everything.

589
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:56,970
All right,well,go make yourselves useful.

590
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,000
forget it.

591
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,730
Man: Uncle sam.

592
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,040
You ever slept in a barn before?

593
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:22,030
You know,it's not like it is in the movies.

594
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:27,710
It can get pretty fragrant in there with all the pigs and goats brushing up against you.

595
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:28,990
You're bluffing.

596
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,120
Try me,please.

597
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:49,340
these are for you.

598
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,840
I lost my head,stanley.

599
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,510
I'm sorry.

600
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,740
Thank you.

601
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,290
you have any idea what you're doing?

602
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,710
not a clue.

603
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,290
thanks for your help.

604
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,210
this is our home,too.

605
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,910
Right.

606
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,330
is he a good man or a bad man?

607
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,370
baby,there's no such thing.

608
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,720
kind of cool,huh?

609
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,070
Yeah.

610
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,460
Especially if you like corn.

611
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,860
Tough work,huh?

612
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,560
Yeah.

613
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:27,760
I was thinking maybe when we leave here,we could,uh,I was going to say go for a walk,but we'll be too tired...

614
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:31,740
april,stop,please.Okay?

615
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:32,850
What?

616
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,480
This.

617
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,880
What you're doing.

618
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,010
It's making things worse.

619
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:43,340
I'm just trying to talk to you,get you to look at me,something.

620
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,970
Well,three weeks ago,you were asking about a divorce.

621
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,560
Three weeks ago,we lived on a different planet.

622
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,370
Things have changed.

623
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,120
Never mind.

624
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,070
april,wait.

625
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,600
There's always the walk home.

626
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,250
Why don't we start there,see how we feel.

627
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:54,390
this town...

628
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,450
jake.

629
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,320
You ready for this?

630
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,110
You know he's going to come for me.

631
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,700
And then,he's going to come looking for you.

632
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,920
There's no running away this time,jake.
