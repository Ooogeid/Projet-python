1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,462
<i>Previously on Jericho...</i>

2
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:02,816
We're on government orders.

3
00:00:02,856 --> 00:00:04,192
Collect food and medicine.

4
00:00:04,232 --> 00:00:07,646
Same government... that ordered you
to kill those people in the hospital?

5
00:00:07,686 --> 00:00:10,031
Pretty soon things are gonna start
to get back to normal.

6
00:00:10,071 --> 00:00:11,909
Government will
put itself back together.

7
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:13,402
And you know who they gonna send?

8
00:00:13,442 --> 00:00:14,244
Me.

9
00:00:14,284 --> 00:00:15,370
<i>I wanna take it all,</i>

10
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,540
<i>trade it for something I can actually
use to build this store up again.</i>

11
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:21,710
Whatever I don't use, I'll put
towards supplies the town needs.

12
00:00:23,996 --> 00:00:26,428
<i>I'm Major Beck,
10th Mountain Division.</i>

13
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,848
As of this morning,
<i>we've restored power to 70 % of town.</i>

14
00:00:29,888 --> 00:00:31,720
Jericho's on the fast track to recovery.

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,428
I want you to be Jericho's sheriff.

16
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:35,173
<i>You guys heard</i>
of the Hudson River virus?

17
00:00:35,213 --> 00:00:37,606
Yeah, from the news.
They stopped it at the Mississippi.

18
00:00:37,646 --> 00:00:40,217
Of course they don't want a panic,
so they won't let us publish

19
00:00:40,257 --> 00:00:42,188
reports that it's already
jumped the blue line.

20
00:00:42,228 --> 00:00:44,314
- Blue line?
- Yes, what they call the Mississippi.

21
00:00:44,354 --> 00:00:46,602
<i>Western states</i> have all
fallen in with Cheyenne.

22
00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:48,433
They're strong and getting stronger.

23
00:00:48,473 --> 00:00:49,664
This is our new mission:

24
00:00:49,704 --> 00:00:52,592
expose Cheyenne's secret
before they take over the whole country.

25
00:00:52,632 --> 00:00:55,133
I have evidence
that could expose the whole cover-up.

26
00:00:55,173 --> 00:00:58,079
<i>Mimi,</i> this is Trish Merrick.
She's with <i>Jennings & Rall</i>.

27
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:59,924
<i>J&R just does the day-to-day stuff:</i>

28
00:00:59,964 --> 00:01:02,745
<i>help deliver supplies
and getting people back to work.</i>

29
00:01:02,785 --> 00:01:04,250
<i>I've seen</i> what they do.

30
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:06,755
<i>How's your search
for Sarah Mason going?</i>

31
00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:10,741
<i>I'm sending you a private contractor
who knows the area,</i>

32
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:13,576
<i>who'll take care of the day-to-day
administration of the town</i>

33
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:15,441
<i>while you find the terrorist.</i>

34
00:01:57,577 --> 00:01:59,824
I'm trying to get through
to the Woodsman Trading Post.

35
00:01:59,864 --> 00:02:01,142
Road's closed.

36
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,539
Look, I don't have far to go,
it's just over the ridge.

37
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:04,781
Road's closed.

38
00:02:05,888 --> 00:02:09,766
You gonna have to go back about 2 miles,
take a detour through Route 17.

39
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:24,880
What the hell's going on out there?

40
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,876
Sir, please return to your vehicle.

41
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,008
I don't know
if you've heard yet, but...

42
00:02:37,048 --> 00:02:39,264
a new administrator
arrived here last night,

43
00:02:39,304 --> 00:02:41,432
a contractor provided
by <i>Jennings & Rall</i>.

44
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,804
He'll be taking over most
of my administrative duties.

45
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:45,583
I just thought
I'd give you the heads-up.

46
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,525
Why?

47
00:02:48,112 --> 00:02:49,117
Sheriff.

48
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:50,506
Jake...

49
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:51,800
Thanks for coming by.

50
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,027
What the hell is this?

51
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:56,155
I was afraid our little misunderstanding
might come up.

52
00:02:56,995 --> 00:02:59,603
Mr. Goetz has already informed me
of your previous run-ins.

53
00:02:59,643 --> 00:03:01,131
Did he tell you about the massacre

54
00:03:01,171 --> 00:03:03,288
he and his men carried out
in Rogue River?

55
00:03:03,328 --> 00:03:07,125
Did he give you a head count on
how many people he murdered in New Bern?

56
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:08,361
What I heard...

57
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:12,713
was that a sanctioned government
contractor attempted to enter this town,

58
00:03:12,753 --> 00:03:14,841
and you opened fire on him,
killing one of his men.

59
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:16,880
- Yeah, that's what he told you.
- Major?

60
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,511
Let me have a word with Jake.

61
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:26,228
I'll be right here.

62
00:03:26,576 --> 00:03:28,229
This is a brand-new building,

63
00:03:28,464 --> 00:03:30,262
and this is my new office.

64
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:33,151
In that office is a desk,

65
00:03:34,242 --> 00:03:36,192
and on that desk is a folder:

66
00:03:36,339 --> 00:03:39,073
the <i>Jennings & Rall</i> corporate dossier
for Jake Green.

67
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:44,329
Let me try to put it
in perspective for you, Jake.

68
00:03:44,568 --> 00:03:48,286
You had a very interesting period
of employment with <i>J&R</i>,

69
00:03:48,643 --> 00:03:50,914
especially Saffa, Iraq.

70
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:52,576
Remember Saffa?

71
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,977
You've heard stories about me,
you think you know who I am.

72
00:03:58,089 --> 00:04:01,657
I wonder what the people of Saffa
must think about you.

73
00:04:15,016 --> 00:04:16,444
Hey, did somebody call a cop?

74
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:18,071
Hey! Jimmy!

75
00:04:18,322 --> 00:04:19,739
Hey! Good to see you.

76
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:23,266
Now, I was told that many of you came
to visit me while I was in the hospital,

77
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,161
and let it be known,
I was heavily sedated.

78
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:26,785
Okay? So I don't remember much,

79
00:04:26,825 --> 00:04:30,249
but... thank you and... I'm sorry
for anything I might have said.

80
00:04:30,657 --> 00:04:32,267
Glad to see you're on your feet.

81
00:04:32,307 --> 00:04:34,163
- Major Beck.
- Deputy Taylor.

82
00:04:35,435 --> 00:04:37,840
You must be the one
that promoted Jake to be my boss.

83
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,634
Yes. Is that a problem?

84
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:42,929
No. It's... you know, I mean, whatever.
It's cool, it's...

85
00:04:43,344 --> 00:04:45,853
Sorry for the imposition.
We're still getting situated.

86
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,011
It's great.
I'm ready to dive back in, just...

87
00:04:48,051 --> 00:04:50,166
let me know
where you need me to go and I'll...

88
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,952
I'll get right back to...

89
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,325
Have you seen this woman?

90
00:05:13,619 --> 00:05:14,585
Got a problem.

91
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,787
What's going on?

92
00:05:15,835 --> 00:05:17,230
Beck came to me today.

93
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,407
About what?

94
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:20,962
Jimmy came back to work.

95
00:05:21,002 --> 00:05:22,483
He saw the picture of Sarah Mason

96
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:25,367
and he told Beck
that you were connected to her.

97
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:28,162
Okay.

98
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:30,479
And what else did he say?

99
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,658
Thankfully,
Jimmy thinks you're undercover FBI,

100
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:34,113
so he didn't say much,

101
00:05:34,153 --> 00:05:37,276
but if Beck asks the FBI about you,
Robert, what are they gonna say?

102
00:05:37,316 --> 00:05:39,902
They're gonna say
that they got no idea who I am.

103
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:42,982
Then how long till he comes to get you?

104
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:47,109
Until he realizes that Sarah's dead
and you've got the bomb?

105
00:05:48,842 --> 00:05:51,496
And his reputation is riding
on this mission. He'll never stop.

106
00:05:51,536 --> 00:05:54,229
Rob, we gotta get the kids.
Baby, we gotta go. Now.

107
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:56,961
Baby, if we run now,
we won't get far.

108
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,298
Robert, what are we gonna do?

109
00:06:08,684 --> 00:06:10,076
How can I help you?

110
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,726
I'm Robert Hawkins.

111
00:06:13,737 --> 00:06:15,352
I'm with the FBI.

112
00:06:16,615 --> 00:06:19,977
I really don't mean to start off
on the wrong foot...

113
00:06:20,878 --> 00:06:23,385
but you're killing my investigation.

118
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:39,962
<i>I've been undercover
on this case for months,</i>

119
00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:43,466
but now, you've been plastering
Sarah Mason's picture all over town,

120
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:47,512
I mean, it's not like it's a...
lost cat we're looking for here, Major.

121
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:50,231
I ran your name
through the FBI database.

122
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:52,841
There's no record
of an Agent Robert Hawkins.

123
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:54,377
No, there wouldn't be.

124
00:06:54,725 --> 00:06:57,688
Well, not in... Cheyenne's FBI database.

125
00:06:58,593 --> 00:06:59,565
Why not?

126
00:06:59,818 --> 00:07:02,499
I haven't registered with Cheyenne,

127
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:04,442
and I don't think that I will.

128
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:07,448
You see,
my bosses still work in Columbus.

129
00:07:07,488 --> 00:07:10,027
They're the ones
who sent me to find Sarah Mason,

130
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:11,748
and when I do find her,

131
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:14,163
they're the ones
I'm handing her over to.

132
00:07:14,444 --> 00:07:18,022
The Cheyenne government
isn't a state of mind, Mr. Hawkins.

133
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,961
On this side of the river,
it is the law.

134
00:07:20,743 --> 00:07:23,639
You obstruct it
for the benefit of another nation,

135
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:25,049
and we call that treason.

136
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:28,534
Right now, I am much more interested
in catching a terrorist

137
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:31,182
than I am in playing politics.

138
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:33,999
And I think you are, too, right?

139
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:39,034
And if your current methods
are any kind of indication,

140
00:07:39,138 --> 00:07:41,190
you can use my help.

141
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:54,409
I want your wife out of this office.

142
00:07:55,856 --> 00:07:57,547
I can understand that.

143
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:00,720
Now tell me what you know.

144
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,203
I've been pushing all morning
with the Army.

145
00:08:05,395 --> 00:08:07,697
No one can do
anything about Goetz.

146
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:10,617
It's like he's completely above the law.

147
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,346
Goetz isn't, Ravenwood is.

148
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,119
Listen to me.

149
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:20,915
Things might get ugly quick around here,
so there's something you should know.

150
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,677
Ravenwood... is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of <i>Jennings & Rall</i>.

151
00:08:25,717 --> 00:08:27,311
It's their own private army.

152
00:08:27,351 --> 00:08:28,571
And anything...

153
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:29,978
anything...

154
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:33,367
that <i>Jennings & Rall</i> does
is judged by a different set of rules.

155
00:08:35,294 --> 00:08:37,454
Well, I'm afraid to ask, but...

156
00:08:37,743 --> 00:08:38,915
how do you know this?

157
00:08:40,298 --> 00:08:44,212
Told you I had done some work overseas
hauling supplies while I was gone.

158
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,255
Yeah, you mentioned it.

159
00:08:46,412 --> 00:08:48,257
I was working for <i>Jennings & Rall</i>.

160
00:08:48,756 --> 00:08:49,592
Hold on...

161
00:08:49,723 --> 00:08:51,000
Hold on, listen.

162
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:52,526
One day,

163
00:08:52,888 --> 00:08:54,728
in Iraq, our convoy was ambushed.

164
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,241
A couple of our guys were killed.

165
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:57,644
We had no rules of engagement,

166
00:08:57,684 --> 00:09:00,993
and we had seen the village
they fell back to, so we just...

167
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:03,572
We just went in.

168
00:09:04,534 --> 00:09:06,150
And we started shooting.

169
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:10,959
After it was done,

170
00:09:11,194 --> 00:09:14,213
there were six gunmen dead,
along with four bystanders.

171
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,118
One of them was a 12-year-old girl.

172
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:28,373
The only reason I tell you this
is because there were no repercussions.

173
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:29,324
None.

174
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,008
The army had no authority over us,
the police didn't.

175
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:34,306
Most of the guys,
they just went back to their jobs.

176
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:35,547
The company...

177
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,781
The company wanted it quiet,

178
00:09:37,948 --> 00:09:39,246
so it was.

179
00:09:42,342 --> 00:09:43,806
Do you understand?

180
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:46,431
Do you understand
who we're dealing with?

181
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:49,235
These guys,
they don't answer to anybody.

182
00:09:52,054 --> 00:09:53,059
Jake...

183
00:09:54,205 --> 00:09:55,908
- This isn't Iraq.
- Maybe.

184
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,237
Maybe, but the rules are the same.

185
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:07,323
<i>Hi, Dale!</i>

186
00:10:08,035 --> 00:10:09,620
Looks like somebody's been busy.

187
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,881
Where'd you get all this?

188
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:12,259
Here, Missouri and Nebraska.

189
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:14,548
We've been hitting
the big trading posts in the region.

190
00:10:14,588 --> 00:10:15,720
What's... What's that?

191
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,209
That's the vaccine
for the Hudson River virus.

192
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:20,433
No, the virus ended
at the Mississippi.

193
00:10:20,742 --> 00:10:22,890
A few days ago,
I came across this trading post

194
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,120
that was quarantined
by the military.

195
00:10:25,347 --> 00:10:26,935
Now, I asked around
in the next town,

196
00:10:26,975 --> 00:10:29,745
and they said that they heard
there was an outbreak of Hudson Virus.

197
00:10:29,785 --> 00:10:32,082
I got vaccine from the black market,
not far from there.

198
00:10:32,122 --> 00:10:33,904
How far away
was the trading post?

199
00:10:34,102 --> 00:10:35,238
Missouri.

200
00:10:35,571 --> 00:10:37,116
100 miles west of the Mississippi.

201
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:39,618
Okay.

202
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,916
What are you doing here?

203
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:58,209
I'm looking for
a copy of a report on a...

204
00:10:58,249 --> 00:11:00,045
John Doe autopsy.

205
00:11:00,513 --> 00:11:03,309
Major Beck thinks it might
be related to Sarah Mason.

206
00:11:03,349 --> 00:11:05,508
I think you know
that's not what I'm talking about.

207
00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:06,846
Thank you.

208
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,150
So, Jimmy talked.

209
00:11:11,811 --> 00:11:13,624
Told Beck I was FBI.

210
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:18,348
You seem awfully calm about it.

211
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,744
I'm not sure
I got an alternative, Jake.

212
00:11:22,694 --> 00:11:23,943
I can't run.

213
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:28,621
So the only way out of this thing...

214
00:11:28,931 --> 00:11:30,134
is through it.

215
00:11:33,384 --> 00:11:34,905
So, what's the plan?

216
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:37,885
I got him talking.

217
00:11:38,596 --> 00:11:40,860
I just need to see
if he's willing...

218
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:46,950
... willing to hear the truth about
the people he's taking his orders from.

219
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,715
And if he's not?

220
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,322
Then nothing I say will matter.

221
00:11:55,352 --> 00:11:58,452
He'll call his bosses
and he'll tell them that I'm here.

222
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:01,214
And when Valente finds out
that I'm alive...

223
00:12:49,522 --> 00:12:50,776
I paid for all this stuff.

224
00:12:50,816 --> 00:12:52,338
You can't just take it away.

225
00:12:52,378 --> 00:12:53,860
You're absolutely right.

226
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,087
What's going on here?

227
00:12:55,258 --> 00:12:57,108
We got word
there was some contraband

228
00:12:57,148 --> 00:12:59,300
in Mr. Turner's most recent shipment.

229
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,344
I'll look the other way for most of it,
but I got a paycheck to justify.

230
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:05,164
- Can you just leave the meds?
- The meds are the biggest problem.

231
00:13:05,204 --> 00:13:06,824
Unregistered pharmaceuticals

232
00:13:06,864 --> 00:13:09,059
could be tainted
and even cause an outbreak.

233
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:11,935
This'll all be shipped
back to Cheyenne to be disposed of.

234
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:13,731
If Jericho needs meds,

235
00:13:13,771 --> 00:13:15,733
<i>J&R</i> will issue a safe supply.

236
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,526
Thanks for your help, Sheriff.

237
00:13:20,152 --> 00:13:21,614
Don't worry about it, Dale.

238
00:13:21,654 --> 00:13:24,867
I'll talk to him, all right? Besides,
it doesn't look like he took that much.

239
00:13:24,907 --> 00:13:26,752
It's not how much he took,
it's what he took.

240
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:28,581
There's something you guys
need to hear.

241
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:42,425
The virus jumped the Mississippi.

242
00:13:42,876 --> 00:13:44,473
Can it be treated?

243
00:13:44,642 --> 00:13:48,098
There's a vaccine, which Dale managed
to find a few thousand doses of, but...

244
00:13:48,138 --> 00:13:49,517
Goetz confiscated it.

245
00:13:52,518 --> 00:13:54,432
Three doctors on this radio frequency

246
00:13:54,472 --> 00:13:57,881
said the risk of the generic stuff
being dangerous is almost nil,

247
00:13:58,274 --> 00:14:01,028
but somehow there's only one
legally approved source.

248
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:02,131
<i>J&R</i>.

249
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:03,364
<i>Hello?</i>

250
00:14:03,404 --> 00:14:04,909
<i>Hello, is anyone there?</i>

251
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,290
Hello?

252
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,720
<i>This is Christina in Fall River,
Missouri.</i>

253
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:10,996
<i>Is this another quarantined town?</i>

254
00:14:11,288 --> 00:14:12,304
No.

255
00:14:13,425 --> 00:14:14,811
No, we're clear.

256
00:14:15,753 --> 00:14:16,970
How are you?

257
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:18,548
<i>Not too good.</i>

258
00:14:18,588 --> 00:14:21,384
<i>I've been working
around the clock at the hospital.</i>

259
00:14:21,844 --> 00:14:23,016
<i>Where are you?</i>

260
00:14:23,345 --> 00:14:24,986
We're in western Kansas.

261
00:14:25,237 --> 00:14:27,763
We're just hearing
about the outbreaks in your area.

262
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:30,383
How long has it been
since the virus hit?

263
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,439
<i>It's moving really fast.</i>

264
00:14:32,617 --> 00:14:35,086
<i>I think...
the first cases ten days ago,</i>

265
00:14:35,205 --> 00:14:37,300
<i>but now we're down two nurses.</i>

266
00:14:39,362 --> 00:14:41,884
How many people have
you lost since then?

267
00:14:42,368 --> 00:14:45,027
<i>Hard to say... a-about...</i>

268
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:45,939
<i>20.</i>

269
00:14:47,986 --> 00:14:49,676
I'm sorry. You're breaking up.

270
00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:52,681
It sounds like you've lost
20 people in the last week?

271
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:54,751
<i>Sorry, 220.</i>

272
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:58,251
<i>Around 220.</i>

273
00:14:58,834 --> 00:14:59,878
Oh, my God.

274
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,966
I'm going to <i>J&R</i>.

275
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:05,593
It's not gonna do any good.

276
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:07,827
Maybe we can at least
have Goetz transferred,

277
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:09,781
find someone we can reason with.

278
00:15:16,357 --> 00:15:17,521
Go find Kenchy.

279
00:15:17,672 --> 00:15:19,148
Work out a way of inoculating

280
00:15:19,188 --> 00:15:21,283
as many people as possible,
as fast as possible.

281
00:15:21,323 --> 00:15:23,819
I'll figure out a way
to get the vaccines back.

282
00:15:24,476 --> 00:15:25,358
That...

283
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:28,888
... that's not gonna happen here.

284
00:15:33,355 --> 00:15:34,642
About three month ago,

285
00:15:34,682 --> 00:15:36,844
we found this John Doe, broken neck,

286
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:39,084
buried out in the woods
near Tookany Creek.

287
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:43,255
Wasn't hard to figure out
that Sarah Mason was probably the perp.

288
00:15:43,295 --> 00:15:44,593
What makes you think that?

289
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,447
Well, look at his neck.

290
00:15:46,788 --> 00:15:48,001
It's snapped clean.

291
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,887
Whoever did that knew
what they were doing.

292
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:51,588
Did you run prints? DNA?

293
00:15:51,687 --> 00:15:54,094
Well, the...
CSI department's been a little...

294
00:15:54,134 --> 00:15:55,392
busy lately.

295
00:15:58,996 --> 00:16:00,898
We've been offline for a while.

296
00:16:01,635 --> 00:16:03,568
All right, run it.
See what it turns up.

297
00:16:03,608 --> 00:16:04,969
You know, when you do,

298
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:07,988
there are another set of prints
you should run as well.

299
00:16:11,863 --> 00:16:13,788
Think you can lift a set
from that, Jimmy?

300
00:16:15,819 --> 00:16:17,331
Sure, I'll give it a shot.

301
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:18,860
Okay.

302
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,295
Whose prints are those?

303
00:16:23,768 --> 00:16:25,130
Sarah Mason's.

304
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,423
I beg your pardon?

305
00:16:26,463 --> 00:16:28,327
Yeah, we exchanged fire,

306
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:30,678
almost had her cornered,
but then she slipped away.

307
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:32,351
Left that clip behind.

308
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:35,429
I've already been given dossier on her.
What more can her prints tell me?

309
00:16:35,469 --> 00:16:37,476
That's what I'm trying to find out.

310
00:16:44,798 --> 00:16:46,318
There. How's that?

311
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,570
Yeah, Jimmy, that's fine.

312
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:57,792
Should I take it as a good sign
you're not in jail yet?

313
00:16:59,483 --> 00:17:01,083
The major is conflicted.

314
00:17:01,123 --> 00:17:04,216
There's still a part of him that's not
completely signed up to Cheyenne yet.

315
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:05,564
What makes you think that?

316
00:17:05,604 --> 00:17:07,961
Well, he's not a guy
trying to wrap up a mission.

317
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:10,092
He's curious.
He wants to know the truth.

318
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:12,143
That said,

319
00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:14,179
I'm gonna need your help.

320
00:17:14,886 --> 00:17:18,267
Now that Darcy's out of play, I need
somebody else to keep tabs on the major.

321
00:17:18,307 --> 00:17:20,107
Yeah, we may have a problem
with that.

322
00:17:20,147 --> 00:17:22,396
I'm about to do something
that might cost me my badge.

323
00:17:22,436 --> 00:17:23,236
No.

324
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:24,515
- No?
- No.

325
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,632
Look...

326
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,654
you are my only eyes
and ears in this place.

327
00:17:30,694 --> 00:17:32,159
If nothing else, that badge

328
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:34,144
is one thing we cannot lose.

329
00:17:36,943 --> 00:17:38,495
What's going on with you, Jake?

330
00:17:38,535 --> 00:17:40,898
Look, I may not have a choice.
All right?

331
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:42,549
Those prints weren't good enough.

332
00:17:42,589 --> 00:17:43,917
- No?
- No.

333
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:46,883
Here,

334
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:48,213
let's try these.

335
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,573
Oh, yeah, that's better.

336
00:17:57,258 --> 00:17:58,330
I'm sorry.

337
00:17:58,721 --> 00:18:00,424
I can't get involved
in any of this.

338
00:18:00,464 --> 00:18:02,352
I wouldn't ask you
if we weren't in trouble.

339
00:18:02,522 --> 00:18:04,591
- This new administrator Goetz, he's...
- I know.

340
00:18:04,631 --> 00:18:06,662
I have seen what he is capable of.

341
00:18:07,731 --> 00:18:09,829
And I will not go against him.

342
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:12,117
This might be our only chance
to protect this town

343
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,678
and we can't do it without you.

344
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:19,139
All right, look,

345
00:18:19,738 --> 00:18:22,262
I will tell you
what you need to know.

346
00:18:22,696 --> 00:18:24,528
You write it down, okay?

347
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:28,586
You administer the vaccines
in a fleshy part of the body, okay?

348
00:18:28,626 --> 00:18:30,789
No one who is ill,
no one who is getting ill,

349
00:18:30,829 --> 00:18:32,841
no one with egg allergies,
that's very important.

350
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:35,897
Now, children six months to two years,
pinch the fleshy part of the thigh,

351
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:38,187
administer the vaccine quickly,
the quicker the better.

352
00:18:38,227 --> 00:18:41,409
Now, we don't need to get everybody,
just 75 to 80 % of high risks

353
00:18:41,449 --> 00:18:43,227
and then we've achieved
herd immunity.

354
00:18:44,682 --> 00:18:46,707
"Herd immunity", I... I...

355
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:48,795
Yes, herd immunity,
it's like when...

356
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:49,849
Kenchy.

357
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,343
Please,

358
00:18:53,644 --> 00:18:54,696
help me with this.

359
00:18:59,883 --> 00:19:01,299
I hope I can help you.

360
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:04,042
Usually the chief administrator
handles the issues with...

361
00:19:04,082 --> 00:19:05,368
local leadership.

362
00:19:06,816 --> 00:19:08,877
The chief administrator
is the issue here.

363
00:19:10,085 --> 00:19:12,534
I need to know how to have Goetz
transferred out of here.

364
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:16,262
I... I don't think that
I can do anything about that.

365
00:19:16,854 --> 00:19:19,555
Yeah, I know, there's a lot of that
going on around here.

366
00:19:20,068 --> 00:19:21,144
Look...

367
00:19:21,915 --> 00:19:23,892
I'm not disputing <i>J&R</i>'s authority

368
00:19:23,932 --> 00:19:25,862
- to have a chief administrator.
- Mr. Green...

369
00:19:25,902 --> 00:19:27,957
But Goetz, Goetz murdered...

370
00:19:27,997 --> 00:19:31,171
dozens of innocent people
in Rogue River and then in New Bern,

371
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,862
and if we hadn't fought him
off here,

372
00:19:32,902 --> 00:19:34,950
- he would have done the same to us.
- Officially,

373
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,755
officially, my answer is that Ravenwood
personnel can only do their jobs

374
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:40,948
if they're insulated from these

375
00:19:40,988 --> 00:19:42,861
kinds of complaints.

376
00:19:43,918 --> 00:19:45,127
But unofficially,

377
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:46,231
my answer is

378
00:19:46,271 --> 00:19:50,210
that the <i>J&R</i> policy
that protects Ravenwood is inexcusable.

379
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:53,152
It's one thing about this company

380
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,925
that I don't understand
and I wish I could change, but I can't.

381
00:19:58,619 --> 00:20:00,220
And neither can you.

382
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:06,863
You need to know that for every
one of them, there is one of me.

383
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:12,032
And if it's any consolation,

384
00:20:12,807 --> 00:20:14,369
since the end of the lawlessness,

385
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:17,669
the reports of Ravenwood
violence have almost disappeared.

386
00:20:20,517 --> 00:20:22,990
All right,
well, thank you for your time.

387
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,447
One last thing.

388
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:30,220
I'm just curious.

389
00:20:30,482 --> 00:20:33,003
Have you been inoculated
for the Hudson River Virus yet?

390
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:37,444
Yeah.

391
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:45,265
It's the name of a town in Missouri.

392
00:20:45,393 --> 00:20:48,017
They've been hit bad
by the Hudson River Virus.

393
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:52,439
The isolated outbreaks in this area
are all being handled.

394
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:53,834
Are they?

395
00:20:54,284 --> 00:20:55,673
Yes, they are.

396
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,945
Is there something else?

397
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:06,828
I don't care what the official story is
or what the news is reporting.

398
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:09,992
People in that town
are watching their families die.

399
00:21:10,862 --> 00:21:11,955
They need help,

400
00:21:12,475 --> 00:21:13,752
and they're not getting it.

401
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:24,792
It looks like
you're restocking pretty fast, so...

402
00:21:24,832 --> 00:21:26,450
I'm assuming visiting trading posts

403
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,400
isn't all you've been up
to out on the roads?

404
00:21:31,052 --> 00:21:31,978
Yeah.

405
00:21:34,945 --> 00:21:35,825
Dale,

406
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,151
as Sheriff,
it's my job to tell you that...

407
00:21:40,602 --> 00:21:43,514
even though the vaccines
are heading out on a <i>J&R</i> transport

408
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:45,769
today to be destroyed in Cheyenne,

409
00:21:46,851 --> 00:21:49,079
it'd be a big mistake
to hijack that truck.

410
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:54,808
I used to haul supplies for <i>J&R</i>
and let me tell you, they are very

411
00:21:54,848 --> 00:21:56,929
meticulous about inventory.

412
00:21:57,801 --> 00:22:00,714
Every bar code that leaves at origin
is tracked at destination

413
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:02,415
or all hell breaks loose.

414
00:22:03,441 --> 00:22:06,623
The only way someone could do it would
be to remove the contents of the boxes

415
00:22:06,663 --> 00:22:10,183
without being detected and leave
the bar-coded containers in the truck.

416
00:22:10,877 --> 00:22:13,073
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

417
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,510
Trish, is the transport
with the vaccine on the road?

418
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,394
Yeah, it left on schedule
about an hour ago.

419
00:22:26,434 --> 00:22:29,764
I wanna know when it arrives and then,
let me know when it's been incinerated.

420
00:22:29,804 --> 00:22:32,247
Why is it so important
that the vaccine be destroyed?

421
00:22:32,287 --> 00:22:33,189
It's policy.

422
00:22:33,229 --> 00:22:35,959
Unregistered meds
could pose a danger to public safety.

423
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:38,164
What if the virus
really is a threat to these people?

424
00:22:38,204 --> 00:22:39,403
Shouldn't they a chance?

425
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:41,834
There hasn't outbreak within
500 miles, there's no threat.

426
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:43,806
Clearly there is some
form of threat out there.

427
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:45,434
I was inoculated, you were inoculated.

428
00:22:45,474 --> 00:22:47,929
When there is a threat,
I will let you know.

429
00:22:52,207 --> 00:22:53,287
What's this?

430
00:22:54,135 --> 00:22:55,504
Purchase orders.

431
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:00,083
That's a lot of syringes.

432
00:23:00,123 --> 00:23:01,426
Who ordered this?

433
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,737
The medical center, I assume.

434
00:23:09,945 --> 00:23:11,914
I want you to call the driver
of the transport, 

435
00:23:11,954 --> 00:23:14,081
have him pull over
and visually inspect the cargo.

436
00:23:14,121 --> 00:23:16,717
I wanna know
everything that's on that truck.

437
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:23,946
Dr. Dhuwalia.

438
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:29,622
I am wondering
why you ordered 3 000 syringes today.

439
00:23:31,432 --> 00:23:33,810
This is a clinic and I need supplies.

440
00:23:33,932 --> 00:23:37,594
That's curious timing, it's almost
as if you planned to run out overnight.

441
00:23:38,673 --> 00:23:40,565
I'd like you to tell me what you know.

442
00:24:00,883 --> 00:24:02,253
Cheyenne, Wyoming?

443
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,562
So she wants you to work for <i>J&R</i>?

444
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:25,355
Why not?

445
00:25:32,206 --> 00:25:34,290
I was so afraid
I was going to lose you, too.

446
00:25:37,226 --> 00:25:40,602
How could such a little girl
survive such a terrible crash?

447
00:25:41,744 --> 00:25:42,814
But you did.

448
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,822
You can do anything
you wanna do, Bonnie.

449
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,250
Anything.

450
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,224
You just...

451
00:25:58,028 --> 00:26:00,622
you haven't had the chance
to figure out what that is yet.

452
00:26:02,384 --> 00:26:03,506
Life's short.

453
00:26:04,871 --> 00:26:05,971
I want you...

454
00:26:06,241 --> 00:26:07,696
I want you to be happy.

455
00:26:29,785 --> 00:26:30,850
You got it?

456
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:31,800
Yeah.

457
00:26:33,046 --> 00:26:34,013
Nice job.

458
00:26:35,793 --> 00:26:38,034
A couple thousand doses. Unboxed.

459
00:26:38,074 --> 00:26:39,536
How did you pull this off?

460
00:26:39,715 --> 00:26:41,579
All right, let's get it divided up.

461
00:26:43,371 --> 00:26:46,459
We'll load the trucks from here and get
them off to the designated locations

462
00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:49,671
As soon as they're ready, we'll give the
go-ahead to spread the word around town.

463
00:26:49,711 --> 00:26:50,694
Got it?

464
00:26:51,463 --> 00:26:52,696
All right, be careful.

465
00:26:52,797 --> 00:26:53,943
Jake, where you going?

466
00:26:53,983 --> 00:26:56,219
Kenchy was supposed
to be here 30 minutes ago.

467
00:27:01,234 --> 00:27:02,357
As I've told you,

468
00:27:02,397 --> 00:27:05,281
any of the supplies
I ordered are a completely routine...

469
00:27:05,321 --> 00:27:07,686
... "Completely routine matter", I know.

470
00:27:09,974 --> 00:27:11,774
I'm really trying to resolve this...

471
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:14,988
in a civilized manner,
but you're making that very difficult.

472
00:27:15,274 --> 00:27:18,742
You may be wearing civilian clothes,
but you're anything but civilized.

473
00:27:24,681 --> 00:27:25,780
I know you.

474
00:27:27,585 --> 00:27:30,252
The hospital in Rogue River.
You were the ER doc.

475
00:27:31,226 --> 00:27:32,977
I saw what you did to those people.

476
00:27:33,017 --> 00:27:34,279
I know what you are.

477
00:27:35,684 --> 00:27:37,921
All right,
I am gonna ask you one last time.

478
00:27:37,961 --> 00:27:38,971
Where...

479
00:27:39,722 --> 00:27:41,139
are the vaccines?

480
00:27:46,204 --> 00:27:47,103
Okay...

481
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:49,261
Now let's talk about how...

482
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,227
uncivilized I can be.

483
00:27:56,998 --> 00:27:58,618
What did the prints turn up?

484
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,198
Nothing.

485
00:28:01,308 --> 00:28:02,716
Came back classified.

486
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:05,161
Top secret.

487
00:28:05,586 --> 00:28:06,994
Mason or John Doe?

488
00:28:07,358 --> 00:28:08,166
Both.

489
00:28:11,281 --> 00:28:14,511
I'm gonna call DHS.
Must be some sort of mistake.

490
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,677
It is not a mistake.

491
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,136
Get your hand off the phone.

492
00:28:20,176 --> 00:28:21,079
Okay.

493
00:28:21,592 --> 00:28:24,432
But don't you realize that
you just stepped on a land mine?

494
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:27,644
What are you talking about?

495
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:31,390
Two subjects,
both with classified profiles.

496
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:33,789
One killed the other
and it's a professional hit,

497
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:35,801
and she has avoided capture

498
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:38,279
for months despite a full-scale manhunt.

499
00:28:39,783 --> 00:28:41,076
Come on, Major.

500
00:28:41,616 --> 00:28:43,509
You're not hunting a terrorist.

501
00:28:44,036 --> 00:28:45,537
You're hunting a spook.

502
00:28:46,197 --> 00:28:47,455
You see those profiles?

503
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,142
They would not be locked
for any reason other than

504
00:28:50,191 --> 00:28:52,459
former involvement with a covert agency.

505
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:54,513
There are plenty of valid reasons...

506
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,256
for a terrorist's file to be sealed.

507
00:28:56,355 --> 00:28:59,031
Yes, but your orders are
to kill on sight, aren't they?

508
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,493
My orders are my orders.

509
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:02,652
Well, they want you to find her
and kill her

510
00:29:02,697 --> 00:29:05,559
before you figure out
what it is you're involved in.

511
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:09,922
You call your bosses and you tell them
that you are even onto a scent of it,

512
00:29:10,674 --> 00:29:13,449
and they will remove
you from the situation.

513
00:29:14,172 --> 00:29:15,368
Or worse.

514
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,055
Get me Valente on the conference, now!

515
00:29:27,992 --> 00:29:30,620
Ask him if Sarah Mason
ever worked for the government.

516
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,365
- Step out.
- You just ask him.

517
00:29:32,526 --> 00:29:34,213
Because he will either say yes,

518
00:29:34,253 --> 00:29:36,693
and explain her involvement
at your investigation,

519
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:37,922
or he will say no.

520
00:29:38,247 --> 00:29:39,854
If he says no,

521
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,572
then understand,

522
00:29:41,629 --> 00:29:44,401
you have just stumbled
into a government conspiracy

523
00:29:44,443 --> 00:29:47,783
that will stop at nothing
to protect itself.

524
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,069
He's all yours.

525
00:30:01,963 --> 00:30:03,063
What did you do?

526
00:30:03,103 --> 00:30:05,116
A little Q&A,
matter of corporate security.

527
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:07,393
He's tougher than he looks.

528
00:30:07,433 --> 00:30:08,335
Let's go.

529
00:30:10,765 --> 00:30:13,475
- What did you tell him, Kenchy?
- I didn't know what else to do.

530
00:30:13,515 --> 00:30:16,336
- What did you tell him?
- The vaccines. The warehouse.

531
00:30:33,894 --> 00:30:34,796
Jake...

532
00:30:34,936 --> 00:30:37,232
Get everything and get out now.
Go out that door.

533
00:30:37,272 --> 00:30:38,804
We have one more truck to load.

534
00:30:38,844 --> 00:30:40,209
Look, there's no time. Go!

535
00:30:40,249 --> 00:30:42,752
If we leave these meds,
we will lose them.

536
00:30:46,385 --> 00:30:47,622
Go. Out now.

537
00:31:05,586 --> 00:31:07,477
All right, get all the stuff
out to the truck.

538
00:31:07,517 --> 00:31:09,252
Don't make a sound.
I'll buy us some time.

539
00:31:09,292 --> 00:31:11,141
- Go with him.
- No, we can't fight this out.

540
00:31:11,181 --> 00:31:14,351
We don't stand a chance. You help them
get everything out of here. Everything.

541
00:31:14,391 --> 00:31:16,158
Dale, don't wait on me.

542
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,848
<i>Are you contacting me to tell me</i>

543
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:30,988
<i>you've accomplished your mission, Major?</i>

544
00:31:31,028 --> 00:31:33,329
No, sir.
But there has been progress.

545
00:31:33,586 --> 00:31:34,497
<i>Progress.</i>

546
00:31:34,736 --> 00:31:36,586
Yes, we're hopeful
that within a few weeks...

547
00:31:36,626 --> 00:31:39,368
<i>I'm not interested in hearing
about how hopeful you are.</i>

548
00:31:39,408 --> 00:31:41,897
<i>If you have questions, ask them.</i>

549
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,251
I'm trying to make sense
of some difficult intel.

550
00:31:47,436 --> 00:31:51,199
And... I'm asking if it's possible...

551
00:31:52,488 --> 00:31:55,226
Sarah Mason has ever been
in the employ of the U.S. government.

552
00:31:56,845 --> 00:31:58,187
<i>No. She hasn't.</i>

553
00:32:00,323 --> 00:32:01,901
You know everything you need to know

554
00:32:01,941 --> 00:32:04,068
<i>in order to apprehend this terrorist,
Major.</i>

555
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:08,197
<i>I'm tired of your delays.
I'm tired of your failures.</i>

556
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:10,663
<i>The next time you contact me,</i>

557
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:13,633
<i>I want to hear
that Sarah Mason has been located...</i>

558
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:15,046
<i>and eliminated.</i>

559
00:32:15,086 --> 00:32:16,080
<i>Is that clear?</i>

560
00:32:16,923 --> 00:32:18,802
Yes, sir. I will find her.

561
00:32:52,634 --> 00:32:53,753
Mr. Hawkins.

562
00:33:42,573 --> 00:33:43,960
So what did you boss say?

563
00:33:48,463 --> 00:33:51,940
I accept your offer to assist
my search for Sarah Mason. For now.

564
00:33:52,877 --> 00:33:53,778
Okay.

565
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,767
And no politics.

566
00:34:00,216 --> 00:34:01,470
Mr. Hawkins,

567
00:34:03,111 --> 00:34:04,769
she still has the bomb.

568
00:34:07,387 --> 00:34:08,409
I know.

569
00:34:16,077 --> 00:34:17,485
I'll be in touch, Major.

570
00:35:00,085 --> 00:35:01,913
We've got to stop
meeting like this, Jake.

571
00:35:04,066 --> 00:35:06,026
You wouldn't happen
to know anything about a...

572
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:08,669
stash of stolen vaccine
in this building, would you?

573
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:10,369
I checked. It's clear.
Put it down.

574
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:12,000
I'm sure it is.

575
00:35:21,814 --> 00:35:23,920
Come on, Jake... let's play ball.

576
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:33,280
Come on, Jake.

577
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,988
It would go whole lot easier for you
if you just tell me where the meds are.

578
00:35:39,299 --> 00:35:41,881
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

579
00:35:42,946 --> 00:35:44,985
Get on the horn!
Tell them we found the vaccine.

580
00:35:45,025 --> 00:35:46,863
It's somewhere inside this warehouse.

581
00:35:46,903 --> 00:35:48,011
Roger that.

582
00:35:58,266 --> 00:35:59,346
Copy that.

583
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,223
Sir, the vaccines have been located.

584
00:36:03,347 --> 00:36:04,267
In Cheyenne.

585
00:36:04,471 --> 00:36:05,382
What?

586
00:36:05,512 --> 00:36:07,248
The <i>J&R</i> office in Cheyenne

587
00:36:07,288 --> 00:36:09,605
says it's been delivered
and destroyed.

588
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:10,496
How?

589
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:14,252
I don't know, sir, but the books are
saying that the load is accounted for.

590
00:36:36,658 --> 00:36:39,215
... bring the rest of the seed
in a few days.

591
00:36:39,435 --> 00:36:41,653
And then get the rest
done in a week or so.

592
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:42,555
Yeah.

593
00:36:43,907 --> 00:36:44,852
Then,

594
00:36:45,048 --> 00:36:46,060
I think...

595
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,144
I'm gonna head to Cheyenne with Trish.

596
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:50,353
Yeah?

597
00:36:51,045 --> 00:36:52,863
Just for a week or two,

598
00:36:53,059 --> 00:36:54,400
to check things out.

599
00:36:56,557 --> 00:36:58,529
I think that's a really good idea.

600
00:36:59,946 --> 00:37:02,867
Maybe you can give me some pointers
on how to take care of Stanley.

601
00:37:03,511 --> 00:37:04,706
I'll make a list.

602
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:08,195
And I'll follow it to the letter.

603
00:37:11,786 --> 00:37:13,059
Don't worry.

604
00:37:14,573 --> 00:37:16,155
I'll take care of Stanley.

605
00:37:16,195 --> 00:37:17,309
Thank you.

606
00:37:18,207 --> 00:37:19,422
You're welcome.

607
00:37:30,979 --> 00:37:34,066
I just heard from the truck
over by Gimbel Field, they're done.

608
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:35,956
We should be done here shortly.

609
00:37:35,996 --> 00:37:37,137
Yeah, but...

610
00:37:38,168 --> 00:37:39,692
They're gonna need you.

611
00:37:56,036 --> 00:37:57,964
I heard what happened with Goetz.

612
00:37:58,173 --> 00:37:59,955
It sounds like we got awfully lucky.

613
00:37:59,995 --> 00:38:01,008
It wasn't luck.

614
00:38:01,437 --> 00:38:05,325
Say what you want about <i>J&R</i>, but they
don't make mistakes with their books.

615
00:38:05,553 --> 00:38:08,849
Someone on the inside changed
the disposal facility log.

616
00:38:09,693 --> 00:38:11,018
How that happened...

617
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,525
I have no idea.

618
00:38:17,924 --> 00:38:19,193
I think I have an idea.

619
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:22,795
I got a radio call from Christina
from Fall River, Missouri.

620
00:39:22,996 --> 00:39:25,812
She said that an Army Humvee
arrived in her town

621
00:39:25,852 --> 00:39:27,650
with boxes of the vaccine,

622
00:39:27,819 --> 00:39:30,688
and a medical Officer
to help administer the drugs.

623
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:32,734
That's good news.

624
00:39:34,779 --> 00:39:36,604
You went outside your chain of command.

625
00:39:38,315 --> 00:39:40,698
You put yourself at risk
to help those people.

626
00:39:41,617 --> 00:39:42,452
Why?

627
00:39:42,492 --> 00:39:45,654
Are you upset
that they received the inoculations?

628
00:39:45,878 --> 00:39:47,756
I'm just trying to understand you.

629
00:39:48,187 --> 00:39:49,549
You're a military man.

630
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,490
Military men follow orders.

631
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,994
We also have families.

632
00:40:01,353 --> 00:40:02,171
Where?

633
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,886
My wife was in Santa Fe
when the attacks came.

634
00:40:08,229 --> 00:40:09,598
After that...

635
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:13,659
I'm sorry.

636
00:40:17,888 --> 00:40:19,296
I have to hope that...

637
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,887
she's okay.

638
00:40:24,058 --> 00:40:25,892
Until then, I do my job.

639
00:40:28,165 --> 00:40:29,328
And I...

640
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,452
I trust that wherever she is...

641
00:40:33,749 --> 00:40:35,228
some Army Major...

642
00:40:35,655 --> 00:40:37,101
is looking after her,

643
00:40:38,045 --> 00:40:41,418
the way I try to look after the people
under my charge.

644
00:40:46,276 --> 00:40:47,318
Thank you.

645
00:41:04,574 --> 00:41:06,020
Where did that come from?

646
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,064
The fax in...

647
00:41:08,978 --> 00:41:10,368
... in Beck's office.

648
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,341
You know, I've seen that before.

649
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:14,645
It's been coming
through Beck's fax machine for days,

650
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:16,703
but I just been throwing them away.

651
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,351
Yeah, that's what
you were supposed to do.

652
00:41:19,556 --> 00:41:21,858
If there was no other way
to reach each other,

653
00:41:21,898 --> 00:41:23,878
the members of my team had...

654
00:41:24,667 --> 00:41:28,132
method of communicating in the open
so that no one could read it but us.

655
00:41:28,282 --> 00:41:29,800
- Is it from Chavez?
- No.

656
00:41:30,859 --> 00:41:31,959
He would...

657
00:41:32,497 --> 00:41:33,812
he would just call.

658
00:41:34,622 --> 00:41:35,556
Then Chung?

659
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:38,013
I don't know. Maybe.

660
00:41:41,036 --> 00:41:42,367
Let's find out.

661
00:41:57,067 --> 00:41:57,971
What?

662
00:42:18,133 --> 00:42:20,387
<i>You found my message in a bottle.</i>

663
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:26,468
Who is this?

664
00:42:26,634 --> 00:42:28,032
<i>I can't talk now.</i>

665
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:30,795
<i>But I know who you are.</i>

666
00:42:31,605 --> 00:42:33,489
<i>I know what you're trying to do,</i>

667
00:42:34,493 --> 00:42:36,075
<i>and I wanna help.</i>
