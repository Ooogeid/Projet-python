00:00:00,176 --> 00:00:01,350
<i>Jericho.</i>

2
00:00:01,814 --> 00:00:05,067
<i>A small town in Kansas that witnessed
a series of nuclear attacks</i>

3
00:00:05,167 --> 00:00:07,617
<i>that destroyed 23 American cities</i>

4
00:00:07,902 --> 00:00:09,140
<i>in a single day.</i>

5
00:00:13,645 --> 00:00:16,566
<i>The attacks crippled
and fractured the US government</i>

6
00:00:16,913 --> 00:00:19,404
<i>and left our town cutoff from the world.</i>

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,417
Please help us.

8
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,502
If this country is at war,
we need to know it.

9
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:29,062
<i>But even in the worst of times,
it's possible to find the best</i>

10
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:31,820
<i>in ourselves and in others.</i>

11
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:35,139
<i>Robert Hawkins.</i>

12
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:38,392
<i>A covert agent
who was supposed to stop the attacks</i>

13
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:40,781
<i>is now hunted by his former bosses</i>

14
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:42,778
<i>for the secret he holds.</i>

15
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:44,466
What is that?

16
00:00:45,928 --> 00:00:47,413
<i>A Nuclear Bomb.</i>

17
00:00:48,153 --> 00:00:50,638
There were dozens of these things
used in the attacks, right?

18
00:00:50,678 --> 00:00:52,239
And now you have the last one.

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,347
Evidence.

20
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:55,452
It's the smoking gun
behind the greatest crime

21
00:00:55,493 --> 00:00:57,286
in the history of the world.

22
00:00:58,063 --> 00:01:00,439
Now, as we're about to be overwhelmed

23
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:02,496
by a hostile neighboring town,

24
00:01:02,536 --> 00:01:04,162
a new government appears.

25
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,267
Based out of Cheyenne, Wyoming,

26
00:01:06,364 --> 00:01:08,218
a government with a new face,

27
00:01:08,547 --> 00:01:09,955
flying a new flag.

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,093
Now!

29
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:58,490
Hold him back.

30
00:01:58,553 --> 00:01:59,825
Hold him back.

31
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:08,002
Sit down!

32
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:17,468
I'm Major Beck,

33
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:19,831
10th Mountain Division.

34
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:22,371
Colonel Hoffman asked me to sort out
what the hell happened here.

35
00:02:22,873 --> 00:02:24,623
I'm in the process of taking reports,

36
00:02:24,682 --> 00:02:27,132
sounds like you two are the ringleaders.

37
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:30,015
A couple hours ago,

38
00:02:30,055 --> 00:02:33,215
you were leading the nastiest border
skirmish we've seen in months.

39
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,190
All-in, 136 dead Americans.

40
00:02:35,616 --> 00:02:36,945
Twice that wounded.

41
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:39,975
Over 70,000 rounds
of ammunition confiscated...

42
00:03:07,435 --> 00:03:09,191
Stanley...! Go!

43
00:03:09,712 --> 00:03:11,063
<i>Go!</i>

44
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:34,419
Anything you want to say?

45
00:04:35,694 --> 00:04:38,112
We needed food,
water and supplies.

46
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,231
Jericho had those things.

47
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:44,096
We tried to trade peacefully,
Jericho responded with hostility,

48
00:04:44,258 --> 00:04:47,808
ending with the cold-blooded
murder of eight of my deputies.

49
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:50,368
Starving,

50
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,844
facing a hostile neighbor,
we had to take action.

51
00:04:57,018 --> 00:04:58,068
Your story?

52
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:00,531
My story?

53
00:05:03,288 --> 00:05:04,677
He held us hostage.

54
00:05:05,992 --> 00:05:07,425
Tortured my brother.

55
00:05:08,113 --> 00:05:10,038
Terrorized us with mortars.

56
00:05:10,362 --> 00:05:11,362
Peace?

57
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:14,001
You didn't want peace,
you wanted everything we had.

58
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:16,394
They attacked us.

59
00:05:17,313 --> 00:05:18,563
They cost us...

60
00:05:18,982 --> 00:05:21,143
I don't know how many men and women.

61
00:05:22,325 --> 00:05:23,875
You cost me my father.

62
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,694
All right.

63
00:05:30,892 --> 00:05:33,729
The dispute between these two
towns is now officially over.

64
00:05:35,045 --> 00:05:37,053
- This isn't over.
- Yes, it is.

65
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:39,641
In case you missed
the message earlier today,

66
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:41,931
I have the means to make this stick.

67
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,698
I'm going to be overseeing this area,

68
00:05:44,823 --> 00:05:47,457
and conducting a full investigation
into the events that lead to today.

69
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:49,058
That's not good enough.

70
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:51,327
Come here.

71
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,219
You have no idea what we've lost.

72
00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:08,559
But there's

73
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:11,687
a reason I was asked
to administer this area.

74
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,883
I'm good at what I do.

75
00:06:18,281 --> 00:06:19,379
Go home.

76
00:06:19,762 --> 00:06:21,212
Be with your family.

77
00:06:21,252 --> 00:06:23,583
Treat your wounded and mourn your dead.

78
00:06:23,623 --> 00:06:24,639
Then...

79
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:26,845
help us rebuild this place.

80
00:06:27,564 --> 00:06:29,114
The nightmare's over.

81
00:06:29,154 --> 00:06:31,122
Order will be restored.

<i><i>It is now six months,</i>

86
00:06:59,914 --> 00:07:02,903
<i>since the day that changed
the course of human history.</i>

87
00:07:03,183 --> 00:07:06,135
<i>Over 15 million left dead or dying,</i>

88
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:08,384
<i>another 40 million homeless.</i>

89
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:11,303
<i>And the remaing elements
of the Federal government</i>

90
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:13,141
<i>left scattered to the winds.</i>

91
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:16,094
Soon, evidence began to mount</i>

92
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,030
<i>that the financing and bombs
used in these attacks</i>

93
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:21,496
<i>had been supplied by elements
within the</i>

94
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:24,280
<i>Iranian and North Korean governments.</i>

95
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:26,942
<i>But the remnants
of the old Federal government</i>

96
00:07:26,982 --> 00:07:28,945
<i>were paralyzed by indecision;</i>

97
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:31,867
<i>and the international community
refused to act.</i>

98
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,484
<i>So began the rise
of a National hero.</i>

99
00:07:35,798 --> 00:07:38,817
<i>The junior Senator from Wyoming,
John Tomarchio,</i>

100
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:40,106
<i>rallied the country...</i>

101
00:07:40,207 --> 00:07:41,625
Hey, what the hell, man?

102
00:07:41,665 --> 00:07:44,030
<i>... retaliatory strikes against
America's enemies.</i>

103
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,111
<i>Sorry.

104
00:07:45,802 --> 00:07:47,822
<i>You've been watching the same
thing for a week now.

105
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:50,003
<i>It's just the same story,
over and over again.

106
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:51,728
<i>What is it you think you're gonna miss?

107
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:54,620
I'm waiting for them to explain
what happened with the flag.

108
00:07:55,797 --> 00:07:57,247
They have explained.

109
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,842
About 400 times.
They're putting the country

110
00:07:59,882 --> 00:08:02,005
back together,
but not everybody's on board yet.

111
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:04,212
Just the states west of the Mississippi.

112
00:08:04,304 --> 00:08:06,753
<i>... day three of his whistle-stop tour</i>

113
00:08:06,793 --> 00:08:08,350
<i>through the western allied states.</i>

114
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,732
<i>Today was Pete Britton's operation. I,

115
00:08:10,886 --> 00:08:12,836
I came by to see how it went.

116
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:13,711
And?

117
00:08:13,947 --> 00:08:14,796
I'm

118
00:08:15,043 --> 00:08:18,351
<i>surprised he lasted that long
with all the shrapnel he took.

119
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,172
So,

120
00:08:22,754 --> 00:08:24,317
what's the total now?

121
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:27,092
- Sixty-four?
- Five, sixty-five.

122
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,463
Sixty-five.

123
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:30,775
I gotta say,

124
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,629
I don't know what kind
of punishment this

125
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,970
Beck guy has in store for New Bern...

126
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:40,790
... but I'd like to be there
when it goes down.

127
00:09:05,373 --> 00:09:06,279
Hi.

128
00:09:07,153 --> 00:09:07,953
Hey.

129
00:09:09,219 --> 00:09:10,019
Hi.

130
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:11,062
Hey, babe.

131
00:09:17,008 --> 00:09:18,995
Doing a little business
with Jennings & Rall?

132
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:20,657
Yeah, they're helping me organize

133
00:09:20,697 --> 00:09:23,416
a community service program
for the high school.

134
00:09:23,793 --> 00:09:24,593
What?

135
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:27,628
Nothing. It's just a little strange
having them here.

136
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,130
Army can't do everything.

137
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:31,399
J&R just does the day-to-day stuff.

138
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:34,024
Help deliver supplies
and getting people back to work.

139
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:35,714
I've seen what they do.

140
00:09:36,624 --> 00:09:38,236
- Meaning what?
- Hey!

141
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:43,395
You know how hot it makes me
when you completely tune me out.

142
00:09:44,976 --> 00:09:45,776
Hey!

143
00:09:46,064 --> 00:09:46,928
Jake?

144
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:50,937
<i>Knock it off!</i>

145
00:09:56,004 --> 00:09:57,508
<i>What's going on?!</i>

146
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:10,631
- You think he's from New Bern?
- Yeah.

147
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,972
Yeah, I do.

148
00:10:35,231 --> 00:10:36,620
Damn it!

149
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:41,051
Robert, you scared the hell out of me.

150
00:10:41,296 --> 00:10:42,588
I missed you, too.

151
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,390
How long have you been standing there?

152
00:10:48,374 --> 00:10:49,624
A minute or two.

153
00:10:50,036 --> 00:10:51,486
Only just got home.

154
00:10:53,206 --> 00:10:56,450
I told you I had to take the satellite
linkup on the road

155
00:10:56,624 --> 00:10:58,534
to see who was tracking us.

156
00:10:58,795 --> 00:11:01,348
- That was four days ago.
- I know, but...

157
00:11:02,523 --> 00:11:04,766
a few hours after I linked up,

158
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:08,226
there was heavy military activity
in the area.

159
00:11:08,464 --> 00:11:10,148
But I wanted to see where it went.

160
00:11:11,442 --> 00:11:12,692
Two days after,

161
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:15,054
they set up a base camp.

162
00:11:15,693 --> 00:11:17,037
Who, the new government?

163
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:19,627
- But they were the ones tracking you.
I- think

164
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:22,078
Valente is working with them now.

165
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:25,853
You know, Rob,
this town is crawling with soldiers.

166
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,165
Is it safe to be here?

167
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:30,835
If Valente is calling the shots,
then he is not looking for me.

168
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:34,021
Remember he thinks that you,
me and the kids

169
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,757
were all killed months ago.

170
00:11:36,184 --> 00:11:38,934
He'd be looking for the person
who killed us.

171
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:41,476
He's looking for Sarah.

172
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,514
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.

173
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,946
I'm sure.

174
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,215
You know, the,

175
00:11:50,935 --> 00:11:52,941
the commander asked me to stay
on in the office

176
00:11:52,982 --> 00:11:55,110
to do their administrative work.
- No.

177
00:11:55,303 --> 00:11:57,264
Yeah, I could try to find out
what they know.

178
00:11:57,304 --> 00:12:00,323
And look, you're going to need eyes
and ears inside that camp.

179
00:12:00,492 --> 00:12:01,442
Thank you,

180
00:12:01,778 --> 00:12:02,665
but no.

181
00:12:02,858 --> 00:12:04,208
- Rob...
- Darcy.

182
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:18,444
What happened here?

183
00:12:18,484 --> 00:12:20,176
Come on. You know exactly what happened.

184
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:22,512
Another thug from New Bern
with a blood feud.

185
00:12:22,711 --> 00:12:24,180
That's a dozen in two weeks.

186
00:12:24,222 --> 00:12:26,946
We stopped just as many men
heading in the other direction.

187
00:12:26,986 --> 00:12:29,336
- Is he talking?
- <i>No, sir, nothing.</i>

188
00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:32,278
- All right, get him processed.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

189
00:12:38,488 --> 00:12:39,432
Heather?

190
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:41,137
Heather!

191
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:45,049
Oh, my God.

192
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:49,664
"Don't worry, Jake.
It'll just be a few days."

193
00:12:50,495 --> 00:12:52,140
How are you? Are you okay?

194
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,335
- Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.
- Yeah?

195
00:12:54,429 --> 00:12:56,588
Yeah. Major Beck was
nice enough to let me

196
00:12:56,655 --> 00:12:59,405
hitch a ride back here
on his convoy, so I...

197
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,540
Hey, you all right?

198
00:13:06,507 --> 00:13:07,507
I'm fine.

199
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,690
I'm fine.

200
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,938
You'll be planting your
spring crop in no time.

201
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:15,894
And my tax debt, that's in there, too?

202
00:13:15,934 --> 00:13:17,484
Yeah. As good as gone.

203
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:18,727
That's great.

204
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:21,597
Your wife?

205
00:13:22,563 --> 00:13:24,748
Not yet. I wanted to make sure my,

206
00:13:24,864 --> 00:13:26,576
debts were settled first, but...

207
00:13:27,286 --> 00:13:29,436
These are the days I love my job.

208
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:31,928
Hey.

209
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:35,753
Mimi, this is Trish Merrick.
She's with Jennings & Rall.

210
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:38,228
- Hi.
- You've got a great guy here, Mimi.

211
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:39,636
Yeah, he'll do.

212
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:42,105
- We'll talk later.
- Thank you.

213
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:44,095
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

214
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:45,782
Did you see that skin?

215
00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:50,058
It's like porcelain. That girl's never
had restless night's sleep in her life.

216
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,044
And here I am, running five miles a day
so my butt doesn't hit my ankles.

217
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:53,932
Mimi!

218
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:56,663
I own my farm again.

219
00:13:57,766 --> 00:13:58,566
What?

220
00:13:58,987 --> 00:14:01,325
I own my farm again. Jennings & Rall
just helped me set up deal

221
00:14:01,365 --> 00:14:03,363
with the new government
to wipe out my IRS debt.

222
00:14:03,566 --> 00:14:06,748
I give them a portion of my crop
for three years, and as of now,

223
00:14:06,788 --> 00:14:08,640
I own my farm free and clear.

224
00:14:08,743 --> 00:14:11,207
Can you believe it?
That's wonderful! Yeah.

225
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,789
- Stanley, that's so wonderful.
- Yeah.

226
00:14:15,302 --> 00:14:16,251
Marry me.

227
00:14:18,436 --> 00:14:20,105
- Wait. What?
- Marry me.

228
00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:21,859
I love you.

229
00:14:22,527 --> 00:14:25,218
And the war's over.
The lights are on, life is good.

230
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,740
Let's get married.

231
00:14:27,303 --> 00:14:28,553
What do you say?

232
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,430
I...

233
00:14:29,777 --> 00:14:31,108
I just...

234
00:14:36,636 --> 00:14:38,893
- This is like my worst nightmare.
- No. Mimi, look...

235
00:14:38,933 --> 00:14:42,294
Just forget said anything. Just scratch
it, okay? It was just a bad joke.

236
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:44,744
Listen to me. Will you just listen?
Just a poorly idiot. Stop it.

237
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:47,615
Of course I'll marry you.
I- I love you. I just wanted it...

238
00:14:48,031 --> 00:14:50,181
You don't understand. I, I just...

239
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:53,883
You know what? Forget it, forget it.

240
00:14:53,923 --> 00:14:55,061
Never mind.

241
00:14:55,382 --> 00:14:57,060
Yes. Yes, I'll marry you.

242
00:14:57,454 --> 00:14:59,274
I don't want your pity.

243
00:14:59,328 --> 00:15:00,954
Not... Wait. I...

244
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:07,683
Let's get married, okay?
Let's-let's...

245
00:15:07,723 --> 00:15:08,845
Let's get married.

246
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:11,458
Okay?

247
00:15:12,894 --> 00:15:14,553
- Okay.
- Okay.

248
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:20,359
Well, maybe you should kiss me.

249
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,634
Jeez!

250
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:23,927
Come here.

251
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:36,833
Gentlemen, listen up.

252
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:38,453
Got some updates for you.

253
00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:39,649
As of this morning,

254
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,770
we've restored power to 70% of town.

255
00:15:42,061 --> 00:15:44,631
And we anticipate full capacity
by the end of this month.

256
00:15:44,782 --> 00:15:46,052
All things considered,

257
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:47,800
Jericho's on the fast track to recovery.

258
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:49,847
That's good news.
After what we've been through,

259
00:15:49,887 --> 00:15:51,622
- it's good to finally...
- He's not done.

260
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:52,659
What's that?

261
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:54,432
He hasn't given us the bad news yet.

262
00:15:55,056 --> 00:15:56,173
No, I haven't.

263
00:15:57,347 --> 00:15:58,331
New Bern?

264
00:15:58,505 --> 00:15:59,624
The tribunals?

265
00:16:00,162 --> 00:16:01,148
I've determined

266
00:16:01,235 --> 00:16:04,357
that New Bern is likely at fault
for the hostilities between you.

267
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:05,208
But?

268
00:16:05,248 --> 00:16:06,719
In the spirit of reconciliation.

269
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,494
You got to be kidding me.
Reconciliation?

270
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,296
... it is in everyone's interest
to extend a blanket of amnesty

271
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:13,130
over a wide range of acts

272
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:15,371
committed during the lawless
period after the attacks.

273
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:17,229
Constantino can't just
walk away from this.

274
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:19,081
To be fair,
he's been removed from office.

275
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:20,695
We're not just going to let this go.

276
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,126
- Jake. Let him explain.
- I don't want an explanation, Gray.

277
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,516
Yeah, well, I do!

278
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:26,600
This guy's been helping
to protect us from a world

279
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,025
that frankly has been kicking
our ass for the last six months.

280
00:16:29,065 --> 00:16:31,618
Constantino is responsible for
the deaths. A chance to make his case.

281
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,282
Of over 60 men and women in this town,

282
00:16:33,322 --> 00:16:34,772
including my father.

283
00:16:35,937 --> 00:16:39,387
There isn't going to be any
reconciliation until he's dead.

284
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:48,194
I want you all to pay close attention
to what I'm about to say.

285
00:16:50,335 --> 00:16:52,861
There will be no vigilantism
in my jurisdiction.

286
00:16:52,901 --> 00:16:55,679
There will be no
revenge killings. Period.

287
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,639
Get the door.

288
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:14,413
Four years ago,

289
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:18,159
I was tasked with pacifying a hot-spot
an hour outside of Kandahar.

290
00:17:19,403 --> 00:17:21,467
I walk into this powder keg,

291
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:23,689
and I do what I always do.

292
00:17:24,113 --> 00:17:25,732
Try to figure out who the guy is.

293
00:17:26,617 --> 00:17:28,783
- What guy? What are you talking about?
- Theguy.

294
00:17:28,823 --> 00:17:30,273
There's always one.

295
00:17:30,787 --> 00:17:33,740
I arrange a meeting. Big public thing
in the middle of the village.

296
00:17:33,782 --> 00:17:36,993
His guys are armed to the teeth,
just waiting for an excuse.

297
00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:39,241
So I walk up to him.

298
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,315
I lay my weapon down.

299
00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:43,689
I showed him

300
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:46,085
I understood his place
in the order of things.

301
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:49,046
And you think I'm your guy?

302
00:17:51,978 --> 00:17:54,312
I want you to be Jericho's Sheriff.

303
00:17:56,606 --> 00:17:59,356
Those people followed
you on the battlefield.

304
00:17:59,588 --> 00:18:00,880
They respect you.

305
00:18:02,504 --> 00:18:04,067
Help me do my job.

306
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:06,722
Help these people move on.

307
00:18:09,427 --> 00:18:10,443
Think about it.

308
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,621
What would you have done if the guy...

309
00:18:21,887 --> 00:18:23,637
if he took a shot at you?

310
00:18:25,766 --> 00:18:27,210
Just think about it.

311
00:18:38,588 --> 00:18:40,938
- What did he want?
- Doesn't matter.

312
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:43,539
Gather the Rangers.

313
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:46,540
We'll meet tonight. Tomorrow,
we're going to New Bern.

314
00:18:47,831 --> 00:18:49,881
We're going to kill Constantino.

315
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,008
You a from HQ.

316
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:55,279
This is a manhunt.

317
00:18:55,331 --> 00:18:56,739
And this is our target.

318
00:18:57,318 --> 00:18:59,826
The suspect's in possession
of a high-yield nuclear device.

319
00:18:59,945 --> 00:19:02,161
The same sort that carried out
the September attacks.

320
00:19:03,103 --> 00:19:05,772
Your orders
are to shoot on sight.

321
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:09,654
We're going to find this terrorist
no matter what it takes.

322
00:19:09,694 --> 00:19:10,619
Thank you.

323
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:13,709
Could you copy these
and distribute them, as well?

324
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,823
We okay?

325
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,890
So, I got a little bit of a situation.

326
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,210
I need a safe house, Jake.

327
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,384
Somewhere, um...

328
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,367
off the beaten path.

329
00:19:42,288 --> 00:19:45,204
Well, my grandpa had a hunting cabin.
Hasn't been used in years.

330
00:19:45,304 --> 00:19:46,145
Okay.

331
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,410
Why? What's going on?

332
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:55,714
You know the news is saying

333
00:19:55,754 --> 00:19:58,809
that the September attacks were backed
by Iran and North Korea.

334
00:19:58,849 --> 00:19:59,649
Yeah.

335
00:20:00,102 --> 00:20:01,173
Yeah, I know.

336
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:04,223
- You said it was domestic terrorism.
- Which is what it was.

337
00:20:04,264 --> 00:20:05,939
Why would the government lie about that?

338
00:20:05,979 --> 00:20:07,810
- Gee, I don't know, Jake.
- You don't know?

339
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,320
I really don't know.

340
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:15,443
Thank you.

341
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:20,990
We're meeting at Bailey's tonight
after closing.

342
00:20:22,376 --> 00:20:24,926
If you're still around,
I need you there.

343
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:28,831
Then I'll be there.

344
00:20:36,012 --> 00:20:38,007
Do they not have food in Cheyenne?

345
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:48,559
May we have a word, ma'am?

346
00:20:59,268 --> 00:21:01,902
The New Bern man
from yesterday, the shooter...

347
00:21:01,942 --> 00:21:03,392
how do you know him?

348
00:21:06,673 --> 00:21:08,989
He was one of Constantino's deputies.

349
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:14,155
When I found out what Constantino
was planning to do to Jericho,

350
00:21:14,195 --> 00:21:17,345
a deputy was told to take me out
of town, and, um...

351
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:19,589
Execute you?

352
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:23,808
But he let you go.

353
00:21:24,394 --> 00:21:25,444
I got lucky.

354
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:30,743
The deputy assigned to me refused
to take those kinds of orders.

355
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,682
But they didn't all refuse them.

356
00:21:33,722 --> 00:21:35,472
The man you saw yesterday?

357
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:37,586
He was one of the worst.

358
00:21:38,745 --> 00:21:39,745
I see.

359
00:21:41,871 --> 00:21:43,698
Do you think
he should die for what he did?

360
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:49,099
Well, I think there's been enough dying
around here lately. Don't you?

361
00:21:51,787 --> 00:21:55,080
I want you to be my liaison to
the people of New Bern and Jericho.

362
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,252
Excuse me?

363
00:21:56,294 --> 00:21:58,254
I need somebody with ties to both towns.

364
00:21:58,348 --> 00:21:59,505
Why would I do that?

365
00:21:59,591 --> 00:22:01,441
- Why wouldn't you?
- Well...

366
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:04,839
Colonel Hoffman said you showed
a lot of guts with him.

367
00:22:04,879 --> 00:22:06,929
He recommended you specifically.

368
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:09,140
I assumed you'd want to help.

369
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:17,835
I just came from a town where guys
with guns in uniforms made life...

370
00:22:19,012 --> 00:22:20,246
very unpleasant.

371
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:23,821
And you can't tell the difference
between me and Phil Constantino?

372
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:35,766
Hi.

373
00:22:38,177 --> 00:22:41,966
I going to take a shower before you
dump me for someone less sweaty.

374
00:22:42,006 --> 00:22:43,883
Tell me you didn't sign this contract.

375
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:47,046
I didn't sign that contract.

376
00:22:47,086 --> 00:22:48,068
Thank God.

377
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:50,858
Yeah, I signed the other one.
That's a copy.

378
00:22:51,008 --> 00:22:52,558
Why would you do that?

379
00:22:52,598 --> 00:22:53,976
Didn't you read it first?

380
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:55,374
Yes, I read it.

381
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:56,726
Stanley.

382
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:58,064
What? What, what'd I do?

383
00:22:58,328 --> 00:22:59,128
Well,

384
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,651
first of all, you owe them

385
00:23:01,905 --> 00:23:04,177
a share of your crop,
starting immediately,

386
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,858
but you won't be credited
the three years until, you see,

387
00:23:06,898 --> 00:23:09,826
"... a national monetary system
"is reinstated by the Federal government

388
00:23:09,954 --> 00:23:12,161
and an exchange rate
can be established."

389
00:23:12,383 --> 00:23:13,193
So?

390
00:23:13,905 --> 00:23:14,705
So...

391
00:23:14,804 --> 00:23:17,915
what if it takes them years
to get the economy back together?

392
00:23:17,955 --> 00:23:19,896
You're going to just keep
forking over your crop.

393
00:23:19,936 --> 00:23:23,589
Well, no, I give them my crop for
a while and then I'm out of debt, right?

394
00:23:24,156 --> 00:23:27,106
That's how you got into debt
in the first place.

395
00:23:30,698 --> 00:23:31,599
You know,

396
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:33,028
I'm going to take a shower.

397
00:23:33,068 --> 00:23:35,192
- Look, wait, I...
- No, you look.

398
00:23:38,326 --> 00:23:39,480
I'm not stupid.

399
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:52,509
We're also hearing that
New Bern is under complete lockdown.

400
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:55,638
Curfews, military checkpoints
all over town, but...

401
00:23:56,306 --> 00:23:58,356
But we think we found an angle.

402
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,852
They've got Constantino
working at the factory.

403
00:24:00,892 --> 00:24:03,003
He leaves there around 8:00 every night.

404
00:24:03,045 --> 00:24:05,840
Security at that shift change
is pretty light.

405
00:24:07,008 --> 00:24:08,604
So if we hit him here...

406
00:24:10,253 --> 00:24:11,603
... right here...

407
00:24:13,288 --> 00:24:17,538
there's a chance we'll get a clean shot
and get out without getting caught.

408
00:24:18,349 --> 00:24:19,799
Where are you going?

409
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,377
Home.

410
00:24:26,913 --> 00:24:28,571
Hey. Hey!

411
00:24:31,531 --> 00:24:33,681
Did you suddenly get a conscience?

412
00:24:34,033 --> 00:24:34,881
Hey.

413
00:24:35,202 --> 00:24:36,182
You know,

414
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,025
if you were smart,

415
00:24:38,412 --> 00:24:40,040
you'd let three months go by,

416
00:24:40,082 --> 00:24:43,789
wait until everything calms down,
and then you would go in there quietly

417
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:46,964
in the middle of the night and you would
kill Constantino in his sleep,

418
00:24:47,004 --> 00:24:50,042
'cause that, I would understand.
But this, this is you just

419
00:24:50,082 --> 00:24:53,012
making a big show out of it,
Jake, and it is both dangerous

420
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,556
- and stupid.
- Really?

421
00:24:54,671 --> 00:24:56,041
Yes, really.

422
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,752
I can't be a part of this.

423
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:06,741
He's out?

424
00:25:07,246 --> 00:25:09,196
Yeah, yeah, it looks that way.

425
00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:11,262
We'll manage.

426
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,224
Listen.
You don't want to hear this, but

427
00:25:13,264 --> 00:25:15,144
you think maybe you should
sit this one out?

428
00:25:15,184 --> 00:25:16,011
Come on.

429
00:25:16,051 --> 00:25:18,471
After what went down
in the Major's office today,

430
00:25:18,511 --> 00:25:19,990
he has his eyes on you.

431
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:23,205
You really think there's a chance
in hell I'm going to sit this out?

432
00:25:23,245 --> 00:25:24,710
That's what I figured.

433
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,567
- See you tomorrow.
- Sleep well.

434
00:25:42,945 --> 00:25:43,910
Get in.

435
00:25:58,607 --> 00:26:00,057
What is this about?

436
00:26:00,843 --> 00:26:02,373
I want you to see something.

437
00:26:02,831 --> 00:26:04,281
Excuse us, soldier.

438
00:26:17,024 --> 00:26:18,990
- You executed him?
- No.

439
00:26:19,352 --> 00:26:21,141
I sent him back to New Bern.

440
00:26:21,917 --> 00:26:24,433
Earlier this evening,
he and three other armed men

441
00:26:24,473 --> 00:26:26,939
were found not far from here
heading towards Jericho.

442
00:26:27,036 --> 00:26:29,024
When we tried to apprehend them,

443
00:26:29,867 --> 00:26:32,217
they made the mistake of opening fire.

444
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:38,033
This man couldn't put his vendetta
to rest, so it was put to rest for him.

445
00:26:40,228 --> 00:26:41,278
Are they...?

446
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:51,839
You asked me what I would've done
if those insurgents had

447
00:26:51,891 --> 00:26:53,341
taken a shot at me.

448
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:55,843
This is what I would've done.

449
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:01,042
Sometimes the only way
to end these things

450
00:27:01,082 --> 00:27:03,559
is to start removing elements
from the equation.

451
00:27:09,084 --> 00:27:11,234
I think you need to ask yourself,

452
00:27:11,771 --> 00:27:15,738
if your father would've wanted
your story to end in one of these bags?

453
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:19,566
My father's dead.

454
00:27:26,822 --> 00:27:27,622
Hey!

455
00:27:32,222 --> 00:27:34,785
We need to talk about the deal
you made with Stanley Richmond.

456
00:27:34,825 --> 00:27:36,678
The paperwork's going through
as we speak.

457
00:27:36,718 --> 00:27:37,617
Tear it up.

458
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:39,651
I'm sorry.
Mr. Richmond signed those papers.

459
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:42,165
I'm not really sure we're going
to be able to void them out.

460
00:27:42,205 --> 00:27:44,683
Stanley tends to sign things
without paying much attention.

461
00:27:44,723 --> 00:27:48,732
Among the things he has signed are four
years of misdated income tax returns,

462
00:27:48,853 --> 00:27:51,183
which made him guilty
of a number of federal crimes,

463
00:27:51,223 --> 00:27:53,142
but it is my understanding that Cheyenne

464
00:27:53,182 --> 00:27:55,977
has extended an amnesty
for non-violent federal crimes

465
00:27:56,017 --> 00:27:58,372
committed prior to the attacks.
So, technically,

466
00:27:58,412 --> 00:28:02,308
I suppose you have exposed
Jennings & Rall to a nasty civil suit

467
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:03,987
for coercing him into this deal

468
00:28:04,027 --> 00:28:06,497
on the basis of a tax debt
he no longer owed.

469
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:10,921
Yeah, that sounds like something
I'm going to need to raise with my boss.

470
00:28:10,961 --> 00:28:12,411
It does, doesn't it?

471
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,116
Please do not stomp

472
00:28:42,594 --> 00:28:45,702
or make any sudden movements
next to the stove, okay?

473
00:28:46,687 --> 00:28:48,237
You're making a cake?

474
00:28:48,372 --> 00:28:49,277
I bake.

475
00:28:49,457 --> 00:28:51,208
- Sometimes.
- Since when?

476
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,113
Okay, when I was a kid.

477
00:28:53,329 --> 00:28:54,579
No, you didn't.

478
00:28:54,978 --> 00:28:56,695
Once, I did in Home Ec.

479
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:58,590
And?

480
00:28:59,391 --> 00:29:00,838
And it ended badly.

481
00:29:01,226 --> 00:29:02,343
Because?

482
00:29:03,101 --> 00:29:05,525
- Because of the fire.
- Right, which could've been prevented.

483
00:29:05,565 --> 00:29:06,815
Leave me alone.

484
00:29:07,283 --> 00:29:08,600
This is for your mother.

485
00:29:14,501 --> 00:29:16,400
It's been four weeks
since your dad and...

486
00:29:16,862 --> 00:29:19,412
She just wants to stay
out at the ranch,

487
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,595
do it her way.

488
00:29:22,521 --> 00:29:25,646
Okay, well, I'm going to do it my way.
And this is her favorite recipe, so...

489
00:29:25,686 --> 00:29:27,132
No, it's my dad's.

490
00:29:30,962 --> 00:29:33,412
He'd beg her to make it for him and then

491
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:36,899
he'd sit right there and tell her
how to do it.

492
00:29:38,012 --> 00:29:40,865
She'd pretend it drove her crazy.
It was...

493
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:43,291
it was a bit they did.

494
00:29:45,906 --> 00:29:47,332
God, he loved her.

495
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:53,103
He loved you, too, you know.

496
00:29:56,264 --> 00:29:57,478
Yeah, most days.

497
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:05,407
How do you think he would have felt
about Constantino getting to walk?

498
00:30:06,984 --> 00:30:09,734
I think he would have
been madder than hell.

499
00:30:12,115 --> 00:30:15,974
But I don't think he would have felt
good about what you're planning.

500
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,133
You know?

501
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:25,788
I think he would have preferred
his death end one war, not...

502
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,149
not start another one.

503
00:30:28,969 --> 00:30:29,769
Yeah.

504
00:30:31,523 --> 00:30:33,773
- Yeah, I think so, too.
- Jake...

505
00:30:34,205 --> 00:30:36,313
- did Eric come talk to you?
- No. Why?

506
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,442
'Cause he took a gun
and went out with some of the Rangers.

507
00:31:10,854 --> 00:31:13,451
Sam and Allison are at the Taylors.
I told Margaret we were

508
00:31:13,491 --> 00:31:14,977
having problems at home.

509
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,155
I also got this.

510
00:31:18,287 --> 00:31:19,443
You were right.

511
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,296
They're looking for Sarah, not you.

512
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:26,464
I told you I did not want you
to be part of this.

513
00:31:26,504 --> 00:31:28,139
I know. I ignored you.

514
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,739
- This is no...
- Robert,

515
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:33,949
okay, we're in this together
and I want to help.

516
00:31:33,989 --> 00:31:34,887
What is this?

517
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:37,837
That's everything that's come through
Beck's fax machine in the last few days.

518
00:31:37,877 --> 00:31:39,277
And these are copies, I hope.

519
00:31:39,317 --> 00:31:42,170
I put the originals back
in the paper tray within two minutes...

520
00:31:42,877 --> 00:31:44,047
What was that?

521
00:31:47,013 --> 00:31:48,594
Are you sure you were not followed?

522
00:31:48,711 --> 00:31:51,888
- Yeah, I don't think so.
- D, that is not a yes.

523
00:31:55,101 --> 00:31:56,551
You know what to do.

524
00:32:19,197 --> 00:32:20,008
Hey!

525
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:23,378
What the hell are you doing?

526
00:32:25,056 --> 00:32:26,869
I'm taking care of this
for the both of us.

527
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:29,051
- By leaving without me?
- I'm trying to protect you.

528
00:32:29,553 --> 00:32:32,253
You never would have
agreed to sit this out.

529
00:32:32,293 --> 00:32:34,811
- Now go home, Jake.
- We're all going home.

530
00:32:34,851 --> 00:32:35,678
Not me.

531
00:32:35,718 --> 00:32:38,468
This isn't what Dad would
have wanted, Eric.

532
00:32:38,989 --> 00:32:40,145
Maybe not from you.

533
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,381
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?!

534
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:44,191
Do you think you lost more than me?!

535
00:32:44,483 --> 00:32:46,897
Is that it?!
You think you lost more than me?!

536
00:32:46,937 --> 00:32:49,468
- I think you had a few good months.
- He was my father!

537
00:32:49,508 --> 00:32:51,631
Well, he was everything to me!

538
00:32:54,122 --> 00:32:56,109
You have no idea what I've lost.

539
00:33:01,697 --> 00:33:03,645
Now, get out of my way.

540
00:33:04,961 --> 00:33:05,797
No.

541
00:34:01,569 --> 00:34:03,688
Somebody convince me this isn't
what I think it is.

542
00:34:03,728 --> 00:34:05,492
It's fine, we've got it under control...

543
00:34:05,532 --> 00:34:06,861
Let me stop you there.

544
00:34:06,901 --> 00:34:10,944
Because if it is what I think it is,
there's a certain way I need to respond.

545
00:34:13,024 --> 00:34:15,316
I heard a rumor there was
an armed party on its way

546
00:34:15,356 --> 00:34:16,406
to New Bern.

547
00:34:16,482 --> 00:34:19,035
So, I gathered border patrol
to head them off.

548
00:34:19,398 --> 00:34:20,537
Do you realize

549
00:34:20,595 --> 00:34:23,364
that policing border areas
is my job, not yours?

550
00:34:23,404 --> 00:34:25,449
It's been our job for a while, now.

551
00:34:25,534 --> 00:34:26,923
Old habits die hard.

552
00:34:34,553 --> 00:34:38,472
We're gonna follow you back into town,
make sure you get there safely.

553
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:44,125
Just so we're clear;

554
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:47,060
you just saved
your brother's life tonight.

555
00:34:48,315 --> 00:34:52,319
And he's not the last one around here
who's gonna need that kind of help.

556
00:34:57,423 --> 00:34:58,407
Drop it.

557
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:05,819
Now, turn around slowly...

558
00:35:06,819 --> 00:35:08,111
and give us a hug.

559
00:35:09,836 --> 00:35:11,051
Chavez.

560
00:35:12,168 --> 00:35:13,190
Hawkins.

561
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:14,839
What the hell are you doing?

562
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,468
This is the rally point, isn't it?

563
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:18,441
Better late than never.

564
00:35:21,011 --> 00:35:22,561
So, put it down, man.

565
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:26,319
You're getting lazy, old man.

566
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:28,904
Ten years ago,
there's no way I'd get this close.

567
00:35:28,944 --> 00:35:29,980
Maybe.

568
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:31,677
That doesn't bother you?

569
00:35:36,556 --> 00:35:37,810
Not really.

570
00:35:42,657 --> 00:35:44,707
So, you going to put that down?

571
00:35:47,287 --> 00:35:48,695
Chavez,

572
00:35:49,342 --> 00:35:51,272
that's my wife Darcy. Darcy,

573
00:35:51,658 --> 00:35:53,297
this is Chavez.

574
00:35:54,605 --> 00:35:55,568
Let's go.

575
00:36:00,696 --> 00:36:02,750
So, who else from the team
has made it back here?

576
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,140
Victor was first.

577
00:36:04,438 --> 00:36:05,888
He didn't last long.

578
00:36:05,928 --> 00:36:07,452
Radiation from Denver.

579
00:36:08,297 --> 00:36:09,356
And then,

580
00:36:09,638 --> 00:36:10,438
Sarah.

581
00:36:11,693 --> 00:36:13,537
- Sarah?
- Yeah.

582
00:36:14,137 --> 00:36:15,443
Didn't end too well for her.

583
00:36:15,483 --> 00:36:17,212
I told you be careful
about her didn't I?

584
00:36:17,252 --> 00:36:18,583
And you were right.

585
00:36:19,714 --> 00:36:20,664
Thank you.

586
00:36:22,585 --> 00:36:24,479
Just three of us left now then?

587
00:36:25,454 --> 00:36:26,706
You, me,

588
00:36:27,729 --> 00:36:28,579
Cheung.

589
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,500
Had any contact from Cheung?

590
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,064
He's embedded in Cheyenne.

591
00:36:33,272 --> 00:36:36,292
I lost contact when I infiltrated
this army unit up in Nebraska.

592
00:36:36,332 --> 00:36:38,374
- How long ago?
- A month or so.

593
00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:40,674
Figured it was a good way
to stay inside

594
00:36:40,714 --> 00:36:43,221
while I made my way back
to the rally point.

595
00:36:43,422 --> 00:36:45,684
Didn't figure on them
bringing me right to you.

596
00:36:45,724 --> 00:36:46,534
Yeah.

597
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:49,681
It's almost like you stuck your head
out long enough for them to

598
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:51,171
track your location.

599
00:36:52,264 --> 00:36:53,093
I did.

600
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:57,402
These people needed my help,
and I couldn't turn my back on them.

601
00:36:59,836 --> 00:37:02,828
And if you are here against me
or them,

602
00:37:04,272 --> 00:37:06,119
well, I may have to kill you.

603
00:37:09,135 --> 00:37:10,971
Man, you are a mess.

604
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:13,565
Well, that's as may be...

605
00:37:14,967 --> 00:37:18,054
... but I did manage to put
a few pieces together.

606
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:25,067
I know that Valente is the one
who was holding Sarah's leash.

607
00:37:26,231 --> 00:37:28,403
- I did not know that.
- Yeah, he's,

608
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:31,424
he's within the government
of Cheyenne now,

609
00:37:31,464 --> 00:37:33,279
but I don't know in what capacity.

610
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:35,969
He's a slippery bastard.
I'm not surprised.

611
00:37:37,993 --> 00:37:39,643
What do you know so far?

612
00:37:40,671 --> 00:37:41,821
You got a map?

613
00:37:53,682 --> 00:37:56,332
You know I've got
the original right here.

614
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:10,693
I'm not a lawyer, but I don't
think this changes anything.

615
00:38:10,733 --> 00:38:12,483
I got them to rescind it.

616
00:38:13,114 --> 00:38:14,364
- What?
- Yeah.

617
00:38:14,408 --> 00:38:17,369
Not only that, but I got you the tractor
and the seed, all of it,

618
00:38:17,409 --> 00:38:19,068
and at a fair price.

619
00:38:19,295 --> 00:38:22,080
And they're also going to help you file
a petition so that you can

620
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,051
wipe out your tax debt officially
with Cheyenne.

621
00:38:25,091 --> 00:38:28,042
Now, that part is
free of charge as an apology to us,

622
00:38:28,293 --> 00:38:29,103
and,

623
00:38:29,462 --> 00:38:31,512
and they also offered me a job,

624
00:38:31,552 --> 00:38:33,623
which I think was part self-defense.

625
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:35,690
You...

626
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,798
Wow, you're terrifying.

627
00:38:39,927 --> 00:38:42,577
I don't like people messing
with my family.

628
00:38:49,687 --> 00:38:51,766
I'm sorry I asked you to marry me.

629
00:38:52,656 --> 00:38:55,119
No, look, I was going to askyou.

630
00:38:56,447 --> 00:38:57,397
You were?

631
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,892
I was, yes.
I had it all planned out.

632
00:38:59,934 --> 00:39:03,584
I was going to propose the way my father
proposed to my mother.

633
00:39:04,076 --> 00:39:05,326
How'd he do it?

634
00:39:05,515 --> 00:39:06,557
Heaskedher.

635
00:39:10,191 --> 00:39:11,191
I'm sorry.

636
00:39:13,062 --> 00:39:13,926
I'm...

637
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:18,327
I'm... just a very goal-oriented
person, you know? I,

638
00:39:18,395 --> 00:39:21,129
see that something needs
to be done and I do it.

639
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:22,620
It's just sometimes

640
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:24,067
I think that

641
00:39:24,673 --> 00:39:26,688
if I don't make things happen,
then they won't,

642
00:39:26,728 --> 00:39:29,659
because no one will
want them as much as I do.

643
00:39:33,409 --> 00:39:34,432
What's that?

644
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:38,456
It's my mother's wedding ring.
Now please

645
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,460
be quiet.

646
00:39:47,948 --> 00:39:50,698
I've never loved anybody
the way I love you.

647
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:54,162
And I can't remember my life
before you, and...

648
00:39:55,197 --> 00:39:55,997
And...

649
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,000
... now I really don't think
I could live without you.

650
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,790
Listen, I'll do whatever it takes
to make you happy, I swear to God.

651
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,290
So,

652
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,469
will you marry me?

653
00:40:18,298 --> 00:40:20,941
You... see, now-now you can talk.

654
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,503
- Yes.
- Okay.

655
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:25,010
Yes!

656
00:40:29,441 --> 00:40:30,269
Yeah?

657
00:40:32,187 --> 00:40:34,521
Yes, yes, I will marry...

658
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,793
Hey, I want you to hear this.

659
00:40:48,843 --> 00:40:51,302
The Cheyenne government's
story about the attacks,

660
00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:52,985
Iran, North Korea,

661
00:40:53,564 --> 00:40:54,774
we know that's a lie.

662
00:40:54,814 --> 00:40:56,364
The question is, why?

663
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:57,760
What are they hiding?

664
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,539
Whatever it is, they wiped two countries
off the map to cover it up.

665
00:41:01,579 --> 00:41:04,377
It's safe to say, there's something
rotten in that government.

666
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:06,848
Who knows if it stops
with Valente or not.

667
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,991
The Western states have all fallen
in with Cheyenne,

668
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:14,929
everything west of the Mississippi.

669
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:17,219
They're strong and getting stronger.

670
00:41:17,792 --> 00:41:20,206
The East is aligned
under Columbus, Ohio.

671
00:41:20,346 --> 00:41:22,386
Remnants of the old administration.

672
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,172
And they're weak
and losing support fast.

673
00:41:24,212 --> 00:41:26,337
How far off is Cheyenne
from winning this thing?

674
00:41:28,357 --> 00:41:30,216
That's where the wildcard comes in.

675
00:41:31,915 --> 00:41:34,691
An independent territory with
a significant military presence

676
00:41:34,731 --> 00:41:37,276
and a massive
stockpile of oil reserves...

677
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:39,989
and they haven't chosen a side yet,

678
00:41:41,571 --> 00:41:42,381
Texas.

679
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:45,607
The Texans are getting close
to siding with Cheyenne.

680
00:41:45,706 --> 00:41:47,944
If that happens,
it's the ballgame.

681
00:41:49,879 --> 00:41:51,529
This is our new mission.

682
00:41:51,815 --> 00:41:54,824
Expose Cheyenne's secret before
they take over the whole country.

683
00:41:56,255 --> 00:41:58,953
I guess this is where the good news
comes in.

684
00:41:58,993 --> 00:42:00,768
Yeah? What's that?

685
00:42:01,806 --> 00:42:04,751
I have evidence that could
expose the whole cover-up.

686
00:42:08,097 --> 00:42:09,872
I have one of the bombs.

687
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,478
Maybe the only one.

688
00:42:14,394 --> 00:42:16,744
Well, that certainly is a good start.

689
00:42:17,196 --> 00:42:21,246
I understand, but with all due respect,
sir, we're not ready for that.

690
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:23,199
No, sir.

691
00:42:24,493 --> 00:42:25,443
No, sir...

692
00:42:27,105 --> 00:42:28,955
Yes, sir, I appreciate that.

693
00:42:29,691 --> 00:42:30,941
Thank you, sir.

694
00:42:36,112 --> 00:42:36,979
Jake.

695
00:42:38,715 --> 00:42:39,988
Just,

696
00:42:40,795 --> 00:42:41,945
came by to...

697
00:42:43,723 --> 00:42:45,208
... to take you up on your offer.

698
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:48,781
How'd you know?

699
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:51,714
I tried to tell you before
I'm good at what I do.

700
00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:01,928
I'd like to tell you not to worry,

701
00:43:02,421 --> 00:43:04,411
but your trial by fire
as Jericho's Sheriff

702
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:06,145
is coming sooner rather than later.

703
00:43:06,657 --> 00:43:07,776
How's that?

704
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:10,382
You heard of the President's
whistle-stop tour?

705
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:11,609
Yeah, from the news.

706
