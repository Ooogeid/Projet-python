1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,100
Previously on Jericho...

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,320
Jake Green!

3
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,840
How you doing, man?

4
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,220
Wait a minute.

5
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,170
--Where the hell you been?
--Around.

6
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,730
Jake, no one's been around for five years.

7
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,380
Seriously, where have you been?

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,300
Hey, brother.

9
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,670
What you put this family through...

10
00:00:14,675 --> 00:00:16,372
--Johnston, for God's sake.
--Now, he could have been...

11
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:18,821
We could spend a week talking
about what I could have been, all right?

12
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:21,992
--I've apologized, but I need my
money to make a clean start.
--It's not your money.

13
00:00:21,999 --> 00:00:23,301
It's your grandfather's money.

14
00:00:23,438 --> 00:00:26,883
--Stay one more day.
--I've got to get back to San Diego by tomorrow.

15
00:00:34,788 --> 00:00:37,642
All right, it looks like the explosion came
from the west, maybe Denver.

16
00:00:37,857 --> 00:00:39,022
Did something happen?

17
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:39,950
Are we under attack?

18
00:00:40,228 --> 00:00:42,830
Hi, Dale. Sorry I didn't call
sooner, angel, but we...

19
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:44,763
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

20
00:00:46,717 --> 00:00:48,973
Sheriff? Robert Hawkins.

21
00:00:48,977 --> 00:00:50,133
I am so sorry.

22
00:00:50,347 --> 00:00:53,292
--I didn't know your mother was in Denver.
--She wasn't in Denver.

23
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:54,572
She was in Atlanta.

24
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:55,401
Oh, my God!

25
00:00:55,646 --> 00:00:57,553
Look, I know you're telling people
it was an accident

26
00:00:57,556 --> 00:00:59,453
but if it was an attack, Sheriff

27
00:00:59,585 --> 00:01:01,312
and there's chaos out there,

28
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:02,951
you might not want the wrong people knowing

29
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:04,363
that Jericho is still here.

30
00:01:04,368 --> 00:01:05,453
It's the wrong bus!

31
00:01:06,796 --> 00:01:07,531
Riley!

32
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:11,040
Get April.
We'll meet you at the medical center.

33
00:01:11,046 --> 00:01:12,610
There's an empty prison bus out there.

34
00:01:12,857 --> 00:01:15,270
--What's your name?
--Heather.

35
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:17,422
Nice to meet you, Jake.

36
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:20,703
--It's a great thing you did t there tonight.
--Thanks.

37
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,271
Something happened in Denver, Atlanta,

38
00:01:23,405 --> 00:01:25,082
and it could be that we wake up

39
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,873
and we find out that's where it stopped.

40
00:01:27,226 --> 00:01:28,193
But, until we know,

41
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,443
are we going to use our imaginations
to solve problems

42
00:01:31,448 --> 00:01:32,453
or to cause them?

43
00:02:18,488 --> 00:02:21,373
--Is there any sign of the sheriff, Mr. Hawkins?
--No, sir.

44
00:02:22,347 --> 00:02:23,983
I need to speak to your mayor.

45
00:02:25,376 --> 00:02:26,812
We got trouble coming.

46
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:46,572
Oh, my God.

47
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:50,531
Mom, where's April?

48
00:02:50,695 --> 00:02:52,610
--Jake, where have you been?
--Where is she?

49
00:02:52,847 --> 00:02:53,831
She's down the hall.

50
00:02:54,117 --> 00:02:56,801
--What's going on?
--Get Dad on the radio.

51
00:02:59,276 --> 00:03:00,803
You'll be fairly mobile on it.

52
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:02,120
How do you feel?

53
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,670
I feel like a badass.

54
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:09,191
--April, does the clinic have a fallout shelter?
--Yes. What's going on?

55
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:10,480
It's bad. Come on.

56
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:14,653
Jericho has two underground shelters,

57
00:03:14,657 --> 00:03:16,452
one right here under the Town Hall

58
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,660
the other under the medical clinic

59
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:19,522
What about basements and storm cellars?

60
00:03:19,527 --> 00:03:20,762
They're better than nothing

61
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,323
but you've got to seal off
the rest of the house

62
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,370
with, uh... duct tape, plastic sheeting,

63
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:27,292
anything you can get your hands on.

64
00:03:28,226 --> 00:03:30,380
How do you know about radiation, Mr. Hawkins?

65
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:32,630
Because I was a cop in Saint Louis

66
00:03:32,638 --> 00:03:35,081
and, after 9-11, we got up to speed.

67
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:38,421
So our biggest problem could be the rain.

68
00:03:39,418 --> 00:03:41,782
Won't the rain clear the radiation out of the air?

69
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:44,513
Yes, and bring it straight down on Jericho--

70
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:46,521
a direct, concentrated hit.

71
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:48,310
Anyone exposed too long...

72
00:03:52,396 --> 00:03:53,983
Mr. Mayor? Sir?

73
00:03:55,775 --> 00:03:56,163
All right, look.

74
00:03:56,168 --> 00:03:58,372
We're gonna divide the town in two.

75
00:03:59,065 --> 00:04:01,553
Everyone over here can go
to the Town Hall shelter

76
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,752
all those on the north side will
go to the clinic

77
00:04:03,758 --> 00:04:04,871
We'll get the word out, Dad.

78
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,552
--How long before the radiation gets here?
--Oh, I'm new here.

79
00:04:08,805 --> 00:04:09,550
This is your town.

80
00:04:09,557 --> 00:04:11,880
How long does it normally take
a storm to get here from Denver?

81
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:14,052
--Less than two hours.
--Sounds right.

82
00:04:14,057 --> 00:04:14,943
Two hours?

83
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:17,390
--We can't do that in two hours.
--Not enough time.

84
00:04:17,827 --> 00:04:19,071
We've got work to do, guys.

85
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:42,021
Jake and I used to play down
here when we were kids.

86
00:04:42,026 --> 00:04:44,501
I don't think anyone's
been down here in ten years.

87
00:04:50,017 --> 00:04:53,443
--How many people can we fit in here?
--300.

88
00:04:53,905 --> 00:04:57,001
You do know that there's almost
5,000 people in this town.

89
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:58,371
- -Eric?
--Yeah?

90
00:04:58,797 --> 00:05:00,573
Make sure all the people
that have basements use them.

91
00:05:00,578 --> 00:05:03,722
--We are not running out of room
here today. You understand?
--Got it, Dad.
Jimmy!

92
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:18,521
When was the last time someone was in here?

93
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:24,582
You're kidding me.

94
00:05:27,746 --> 00:05:29,520
I can't put people in here.

95
00:05:29,748 --> 00:05:30,790
There's no air.

96
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:31,870
There's no air in here.

97
00:05:32,576 --> 00:05:34,012
I hope the fan works.

98
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:36,662
We got a lot of work to do.

99
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:51,950
Wait, wait! Hey, hey!

100
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:11,691
Oh, thank God. I haven't seen anybody for hours.

101
00:06:11,697 --> 00:06:12,773
I ran out of gas.

102
00:06:13,326 --> 00:06:15,640
--There's dead birds all over the road.
--Yeah, we saw them, too.

103
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:17,143
They must have flown through the radiation.

104
00:06:18,997 --> 00:06:19,923
What radiation?

105
00:06:20,795 --> 00:06:21,861
There was a mushroom cloud.

106
00:06:21,957 --> 00:06:23,151
Somebody nuked us.

107
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,352
Oh, my God.

108
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:31,012
Look,  Miss, we're running low on gas.

109
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:32,602
Do you know if there's
a gas station nearby?

110
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:33,783
Well, what do you think it is?

111
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:36,483
--Do you think it's an accident or...?
--Ma'am, we don't know yet.

112
00:06:37,486 --> 00:06:38,230
Okay.

113
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,373
Did it come from Wichita,

114
00:06:39,378 --> 00:06:41,550
--because my fiance, he's flying in from...
--No, no. Wrong direction.

115
00:06:41,557 --> 00:06:42,750
It looked more like Denver.

116
00:06:45,645 --> 00:06:47,040
Look, we need gas.

117
00:06:47,205 --> 00:06:51,760
--Do you know if there is a gas station nearby?
--Uh... yeah. No.

118
00:06:51,987 --> 00:06:52,943
No, the pumps are...

119
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:53,793
They don't work.

120
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:55,121
They've all been abandoned.

121
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:58,721
No,  we could... We could try
the Richmond Ranch.

122
00:06:58,725 --> 00:07:00,691
--I think they might have gas there.
--Then get in.

123
00:07:00,698 --> 00:07:01,422
We'll take you there.

124
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:06,330
Miss?

125
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:09,690
It's okay. Get in.

126
00:07:35,816 --> 00:07:36,550
Dale?

127
00:07:37,147 --> 00:07:38,031
Wake up.

128
00:07:40,415 --> 00:07:41,680
Wake up, angel.

129
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:45,770
Mom?

130
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:55,292
Don't you remember what happened last night?

131
00:07:56,405 --> 00:07:57,572
Your mom's gone.

132
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:07,792
Gracie? Come on, Gracie!
Open up!

133
00:08:07,995 --> 00:08:10,803
Gracie, we need to stock the shelters with food!

134
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:15,510
Attention! Attention!

135
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:20,001
There is radioactive fallout
coming from the nuclear blast.

136
00:08:20,695 --> 00:08:23,002
You have less than 90 minutes to get indoors

137
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:27,233
I repeat, you have less than 90 minutes to get indoors.

138
00:08:27,828 --> 00:08:29,260
Use your basements.

139
00:08:29,498 --> 00:08:32,530
Use duct tape or other tape to seal your home.

140
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:34,793
You have less than 90 minutes.

141
00:08:35,377 --> 00:08:37,520
You can go to the shelter at Town Hall

142
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:39,540
or the shelter at the medical center.

143
00:08:39,547 --> 00:08:42,100
There is radioactive fallout coming.

144
00:08:42,102 --> 00:08:44,891
You have 90 minutes to get yourselves indoors.

145
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,402
We are indoors!

146
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:51,231
You're not from around here, are you?

147
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,992
I came from D.C. to supervise
a little audit on a farm.

148
00:08:57,388 --> 00:08:58,713
Is God punishing me?

149
00:08:59,415 --> 00:09:01,712
Look, you really should get
to the basement at Town Hall.

150
00:09:02,295 --> 00:09:03,381
You think?

151
00:09:03,805 --> 00:09:06,071
--Jake, I'm not going anywhere.
--Mom...

152
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,433
Mom, I'm not going to argue with you.

153
00:09:08,668 --> 00:09:11,000
--Go to the other shelter.
--I'm staying.

154
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:13,183
Mom, I don't even know if we can fix it

155
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:15,111
and I can't concentrate knowing you're here.

156
00:09:15,465 --> 00:09:16,671
Please, I'll be fine.

157
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,172
I'll be fine.

158
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:22,061
Promise me you'll come to the shelter

159
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:23,412
after it's fixed.

160
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:26,081
Promise me.

161
00:09:26,795 --> 00:09:27,881
I promise, Mom.

162
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:33,923
I want my boys with me.

163
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,581
Okay, go.

164
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:38,301
Please.

165
00:09:43,768 --> 00:09:45,642
Frank! Quit messing with the TV.

166
00:09:45,646 --> 00:09:47,850
I don't want to waste my generator on static.

167
00:09:48,197 --> 00:09:52,951
--Mary, what are these people still doing here?
--They won't go.

168
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:55,230
I can't leave these clowns in my bar.

169
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,431
All right, listen up.

170
00:09:58,606 --> 00:10:00,821
Radiation's on its way from Denver.

171
00:10:01,056 --> 00:10:01,913
If you don't have a basement,

172
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:03,353
you need to get to Town Hall.

173
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:04,873
There's a shelter there.

174
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,503
I'm not going to Town Hall.

175
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:10,953
Well, you don't have a choice, people.

176
00:10:11,155 --> 00:10:12,481
You're being evacuated.

177
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:14,021
And who are you?

178
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:16,563
I'm the deputy mayor.

179
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:22,372
What, did your daddy make you a deputy?

180
00:10:24,387 --> 00:10:25,202
Just forget it, Eric,

181
00:10:25,206 --> 00:10:26,442
you've told everybody.

182
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:34,001
--Do you realize a nuclear bomb went off yesterday?
--So?

183
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,842
If I'm going to die in a nuclear blast, so be it.

184
00:10:37,306 --> 00:10:38,460
I'm going to be right here

185
00:10:38,977 --> 00:10:40,681
playing pool with my buddies.

186
00:10:41,697 --> 00:10:43,293
But you're not going to die in a blast.

187
00:10:45,317 --> 00:10:47,422
You're going to get radiation poisoning.

188
00:10:49,888 --> 00:10:51,522
Within the first couple of hours

189
00:10:52,538 --> 00:10:53,580
you're going to be vomiting

190
00:10:53,788 --> 00:10:55,532
and have crippling diarrhea.

191
00:10:56,626 --> 00:10:58,501
Your hair is going to fall out in chunks.

192
00:10:58,995 --> 00:10:59,891
Your skin,

193
00:11:00,338 --> 00:11:01,491
it's going to blister.

194
00:11:02,638 --> 00:11:05,242
Your internal organs are going to start to shut down.

195
00:11:06,218 --> 00:11:08,041
Because, well, frankly...

196
00:11:09,406 --> 00:11:11,732
...they're being cooked from the inside.

197
00:11:12,315 --> 00:11:14,060
You're going to get sicker and sicker

198
00:11:14,315 --> 00:11:15,452
until you can't move.

199
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:18,441
And then you will die.

200
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:23,311
Over there on the floor by the pool table...

201
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:24,821
with your buddies.

202
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,123
Ooh.

203
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:48,660
Don't mind me.

204
00:12:15,058 --> 00:12:15,952
Sit tight.

205
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:17,433
We'll be right back.

206
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:37,491
Sheriff, come in.

207
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:39,021
Come in, Sheriff, over.

208
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:41,790
Randall, no one's heard from the sheriff
since last night

209
00:12:41,797 --> 00:12:43,481
There  was a prison bus out there.

210
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:45,493
I think we better assume the worst.

211
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,323
You're on your own.

212
00:12:46,768 --> 00:12:48,091
What about Jimmy or Bill?

213
00:12:48,876 --> 00:12:49,883
Deputies are missing, too.

214
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:51,663
You're just going to have
to handle this yourself.

215
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,693
Don't think we forgot you, did you?

216
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:06,611
--Anything wrong, Miss?
--No, nothing.

217
00:13:07,616 --> 00:13:08,793
Doesn't look like anybody's here.

218
00:13:08,795 --> 00:13:11,080
Yeah, well, the pump's locked, so...

219
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:13,832
You know, there is this other place
that I can take you to.

220
00:13:13,838 --> 00:13:15,940
Look, we're running on fumes as it is.

221
00:13:26,965 --> 00:13:29,391
Make a sound, you die.

222
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,103
I'm sorry, sir,

223
00:13:32,108 --> 00:13:33,770
I don't think anybody's home.

224
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:40,423
Ms. Sullivan...

225
00:13:40,426 --> 00:13:42,590
--What a surprise.
--Hey, Bonnie.

226
00:13:53,805 --> 00:13:55,411
Oxygen tanks, IVs,

227
00:13:55,487 --> 00:13:58,143
all non-electrical medical supplies.

228
00:13:58,568 --> 00:14:00,823
--When was that written?
--1957.

229
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:02,881
The population of Jericho was 1,000 people.

230
00:14:03,245 --> 00:14:04,423
I'll start moving everyone.

231
00:14:04,425 --> 00:14:06,513
I'll get the ventilation system fixed.

232
00:14:09,618 --> 00:14:11,522
God, they chewed through everything.

233
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:12,670
Mind if I pitch in?

234
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:14,820
You know how to strip wires?

235
00:14:15,216 --> 00:14:16,570
Ever since junior high.

236
00:14:18,376 --> 00:14:19,770
Yeah, I was that popular.

237
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:21,463
All right, great.

238
00:14:22,005 --> 00:14:22,700
Check the fan belt,

239
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:23,740
I think it's frayed.

240
00:14:23,908 --> 00:14:25,542
Well, then you might want to get another one.

241
00:14:26,445 --> 00:14:29,441
Any mid-century American car would
be a good match.

242
00:14:29,447 --> 00:14:30,701
And check the brushers.

243
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:32,253
--We don't want the motor to seize up.
--Okay.

244
00:14:32,258 --> 00:14:33,160
All right.

245
00:14:33,946 --> 00:14:35,190
You take over.

246
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:36,781
I'll look for a fan belt.

247
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:43,031
Excuse me, sir.

248
00:14:43,187 --> 00:14:44,353
You're doing that wrong.

249
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:48,060
April.

250
00:14:48,745 --> 00:14:50,650
She thinks we shouldn't move the baby.

251
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,750
Ma'am, your baby's protected
in this little bubble.

252
00:14:56,387 --> 00:14:58,453
She's got fresh air and food.

253
00:14:58,955 --> 00:15:01,001
Right now, she's the safest
person in Jericho

254
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:01,920
but you're not.

255
00:15:02,705 --> 00:15:05,061
We need to make sure she has
a mother to take care of her

256
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:08,261
when this thing is over, okay?

257
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:09,551
Please.

258
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:15,722
--Please, let us take you both
down to the shelter, okay?
--Mm-hmm.

259
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:16,650
Okay.

260
00:15:20,947 --> 00:15:22,473
--Bobby.
--Jake Green?

261
00:15:22,477 --> 00:15:23,190
Just a second, ma'am.

262
00:15:23,195 --> 00:15:25,320
--obby, there's two in the nursery.
--I'm Emily Sullivan's aunt.

263
00:15:26,346 --> 00:15:29,190
...taken to the shelter in our basement.

264
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:31,362
Mrs. Dawson, hi.

265
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:34,600
--Have you seen Emily?
--No, not since yesterday.

266
00:15:34,606 --> 00:15:36,140
Maybe she's at the other shelter.

267
00:15:36,147 --> 00:15:37,541
No one over there has seen her

268
00:15:37,547 --> 00:15:39,361
and she's not at her house.

269
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:42,521
I heard you were back in town

270
00:15:42,526 --> 00:15:44,913
--and I figured the one person who would know...
--I'm sorry.

271
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:46,242
I have to go.

272
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:47,980
If I see her, I'll tell her
you're looking for her

273
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,102
but I'm sure she's fine.

274
00:15:58,297 --> 00:15:59,733
So we'll just, uh,

275
00:15:59,937 --> 00:16:01,912
use your pump and be on our way.

276
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:03,582
Stanley has the key.

277
00:16:04,277 --> 00:16:05,332
What did she just say?

278
00:16:05,955 --> 00:16:07,682
Oh... her brother, Stanley,

279
00:16:07,686 --> 00:16:09,072
he's got the key to the pump.

280
00:16:09,507 --> 00:16:10,132
Wait a minute,

281
00:16:10,488 --> 00:16:12,973
--she's deaf?
--Yes.

282
00:16:15,305 --> 00:16:16,783
I read lips.

283
00:16:20,425 --> 00:16:22,871
--When do you think Stanley gets back?
--Another hour.

284
00:16:23,168 --> 00:16:24,760
--Whoa, whoa, whoa.
--What did she just say?

285
00:16:25,158 --> 00:16:26,391
It's going to be about an hour.

286
00:16:26,907 --> 00:16:30,641
Oh, we can wait an hour, can't we?

287
00:16:33,788 --> 00:16:36,353
Ms. Sullivan, you all right?

288
00:16:39,818 --> 00:16:40,861
Yeah, fine.

289
00:16:41,216 --> 00:16:42,301
I'm just hungry.

290
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:44,263
Yeah, uh...

291
00:16:44,265 --> 00:16:47,723
Why don't we make some food for the officers?

292
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:50,182
Oh,  I want eggs.

293
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:51,151
It's a farmhouse,

294
00:16:51,157 --> 00:16:52,363
you've got eggs, right?

295
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:55,991
Yeah, why don't we, uh...

296
00:16:56,826 --> 00:16:58,222
Why don't we all go make something to eat?

297
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,281
Sure.

298
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:10,613
People south of Main
go to you at Town Hall?

299
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:11,513
Yeah, that's right,

300
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:14,323
all those to the north of Main Street
go to the medical center.

301
00:17:14,328 --> 00:17:17,332
--Johnston.
--Right, yeah, I know, you want me
to take it easy.

302
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:21,423
--I'm just going to go help Eric
get the supplies from Gracie.
--I've already sent people to do that.

303
00:17:21,428 --> 00:17:23,800
Gail, who is in charge here, you or me?

304
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,132
You do not want to play that game.

305
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:29,671
Here's every book we have in the library
about nuclear radiation.

306
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:32,550
--Our Friend The Atom.
--Some friend.

307
00:17:33,406 --> 00:17:34,920
Anything in here for grownups?

308
00:17:34,926 --> 00:17:36,232
I'd like to know what we're supposed to do

309
00:17:36,236 --> 00:17:37,322
if this town gets hit.

310
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:39,391
None of the books are specific.

311
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:43,321
Atom bombs have only gone off in
populated cities twice in history.

312
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:46,003
And Denver was probably hit
by a hydrogen bomb, anyway.

313
00:17:46,348 --> 00:17:47,430
What's the difference?

314
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:51,150
Hydrogen bombs, they literally
explode the air.

315
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:55,503
So, what you're saying
is that nobody knows

316
00:17:55,506 --> 00:17:56,852
what's really coming?

317
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,382
Then we pick worst case scenario.

318
00:18:00,387 --> 00:18:03,181
--What needs to be done?
--One second, sir, I have that.

319
00:18:03,258 --> 00:18:04,393
Let me just...

320
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:08,791
Anything left outside
will have to be scrubbed down.

321
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:12,751
And if it rains, the top
18 inches or so of soil

322
00:18:12,756 --> 00:18:15,210
will have to be removed before planting again.

323
00:18:15,216 --> 00:18:18,252
And tell everybody to cover
all the water wells.

324
00:18:19,255 --> 00:18:20,940
That's about what it says, right?

325
00:18:23,158 --> 00:18:25,103
Yes. Yes, that's right.

326
00:18:26,477 --> 00:18:27,991
Well, you heard the man.

327
00:18:27,995 --> 00:18:31,142
Jeff, let's make sure all the ranchers
get the livestock inside.

328
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:33,430
I'm going to work on the radio.

329
00:18:33,927 --> 00:18:37,043
This may be our last chance
to make contact for a while.

330
00:18:37,546 --> 00:18:38,640
There's a bunch of people in the church.

331
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:39,890
They held a vigil there all night.

332
00:18:39,896 --> 00:18:41,822
I'm going to make sure they get into shelter.

333
00:18:41,897 --> 00:18:45,011
--Hurry back.
--Yes, ma'am.

334
00:18:48,366 --> 00:18:51,010
--I'm telling you they need to be replaced.
--Listen, girlie...

335
00:18:51,018 --> 00:18:53,082
Please, don't argue with me.
don't tell me...

336
00:18:53,086 --> 00:18:54,542
The brushers are shot,

337
00:18:54,545 --> 00:18:56,091
it's revving too high. It's...

338
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:58,953
Turn them off!

339
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,332
Jake, everyone's ready.

340
00:19:08,557 --> 00:19:10,362
--What do we do now?
--Don't let them in here!

341
00:19:10,797 --> 00:19:12,421
The rain's going to be here soon.

342
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:13,820
People are getting scared.

343
00:19:14,145 --> 00:19:15,620
Do we have air or not?

344
00:19:15,977 --> 00:19:17,750
You seal them up in here
they're going to die.

345
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,671
Hello,Dad

346
00:19:29,388 --> 00:19:30,580
Dad, can you hear me?

347
00:19:31,528 --> 00:19:32,900
Dad's checking on the church, Jake

348
00:19:32,986 --> 00:19:33,742
What do you need?

349
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:35,571
Our shelter's no good.

350
00:19:35,617 --> 00:19:37,253
I'm bringing these people to Town Hall.

351
00:19:37,258 --> 00:19:38,140
Whoa, whoa, hold on.

352
00:19:38,297 --> 00:19:40,611
Jake, I don't know how many more
people we can hold.

353
00:19:41,076 --> 00:19:43,610
--What about the basement?
--They don't have basements, Eric.

354
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:44,701
That's why they came here.

355
00:19:45,326 --> 00:19:47,542
Eric, we've got 200 people here.

356
00:19:47,546 --> 00:19:49,732
Some of them need medical attention.

357
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:50,961
Handle it.

358
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:52,713
Look, I will be at Town Hall soon.

359
00:19:52,717 --> 00:19:54,493
I'll check to see how much room we have.

360
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:57,583
--And I will call you back.
--I don't have time. We're coming.

361
00:19:57,955 --> 00:20:02,071
--Sorry, my husband needs a kick sometimes.
--You don't have to apologize to me.

362
00:20:06,898 --> 00:20:08,050
I've got to go to the shelter.

363
00:20:08,056 --> 00:20:09,372
Bring everything you can.

364
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:13,191
H-How much more do you need?

365
00:20:13,737 --> 00:20:17,110
--Enough to feed half the town, Gracie.
--Half the town?

366
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,242
Wait--

367
00:20:25,476 --> 00:20:29,033
--Skylar, you have to come to the shelter.
--I'm not going to some stupid shelter.

368
00:20:29,037 --> 00:20:30,603
I'm going home to wait for my parents.

369
00:20:30,786 --> 00:20:32,291
--Don't be crazy.
--I'm not crazy!

370
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,901
--I'm going home.
--Fine.

371
00:20:33,908 --> 00:20:35,552
Excuse me, ladie

372
00:20:35,827 --> 00:20:37,420
Are you going to pay for those?

373
00:20:38,187 --> 00:20:38,970
What are you talking about?

374
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:40,713
Everybody is just taking stuff.

375
00:20:40,718 --> 00:20:42,590
This is still my store.

376
00:20:42,905 --> 00:20:44,621
Is that for an emergency?

377
00:20:47,056 --> 00:20:48,242
All right, you know what?

378
00:20:49,056 --> 00:20:50,503
Fine, keep it.

379
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:54,592
Her parents are in New York, okay?

380
00:20:54,598 --> 00:20:56,742
Who knows if they're even going to come back.

381
00:20:59,577 --> 00:21:03,430
--It was just a couple cans of soda.
--They're my soda.

382
00:21:13,358 --> 00:21:14,600
I say we head east.

383
00:21:14,718 --> 00:21:16,342
She was headed east, wasn't she?

384
00:21:17,396 --> 00:21:21,073
Hey, how far from here
would you say those crows were?

385
00:21:21,537 --> 00:21:24,031
About five miles west
from where you picked me up.

386
00:21:25,975 --> 00:21:27,301
Hell, then we'll go north.

387
00:21:41,845 --> 00:21:42,471
Hey.

388
00:21:43,065 --> 00:21:44,951
You want to help me out with the coffee?

389
00:21:45,825 --> 00:21:47,543
Yeah, I'll show you where it is.

390
00:21:59,058 --> 00:22:00,260
You better get down to that shelter.

391
00:22:00,268 --> 00:22:02,870
--The  wind is moving faster than we thought
--I'm watching it.

392
00:22:02,878 --> 00:22:04,702
Just get everybody underground.

393
00:22:06,267 --> 00:22:07,631
You know, if you get that thing to work,

394
00:22:07,637 --> 00:22:11,243
just do me a favor, and find
out who did this to us.

395
00:22:32,537 --> 00:22:34,922
--Eric, come in.
--This is Eric, go ahead.

396
00:22:34,925 --> 00:22:37,410
A couple of busloads coming to Town Hall.

397
00:22:50,205 --> 00:22:51,381
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

398
00:22:51,385 --> 00:22:52,583
People, please!

399
00:22:52,587 --> 00:22:53,600
Don't get off the bus.

400
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:56,611
--We can't take any more.
--Eric, what the hell are you doing?

401
00:22:56,927 --> 00:22:57,871
They can't come in here, Jake.

402
00:22:57,875 --> 00:22:59,331
--What do you mean they can't come in here?
--We're packed!

403
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,913
What? I got a whole bus full of
people here that need shelter.

404
00:23:01,918 --> 00:23:04,262
You're really gonna turn away
all these people, Eric?

405
00:23:04,265 --> 00:23:05,822
You're going to turn away your wife?

406
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:07,630
We let everybody in,

407
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:08,982
we'll all suffocate.

408
00:23:09,127 --> 00:23:11,001
Eric, there are really sick people here

409
00:23:11,007 --> 00:23:12,533
and the storm is coming!

410
00:23:12,537 --> 00:23:13,690
Okay, we can take ten.

411
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:16,202
And I saved a spot for you.

412
00:23:17,288 --> 00:23:19,262
All right, the ten most critical, fast.

413
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:21,891
Gray, the salt mine,
how many people will it hold?

414
00:23:21,895 --> 00:23:22,911
As many as you want,

415
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:25,291
--but I don't think...
--It has a ventilation system, right?

416
00:23:25,557 --> 00:23:29,513
--Yeah, and water.
--All right, it's the best option
we have right now, all right?

417
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:30,290
Mom?

418
00:23:30,297 --> 00:23:31,652
Have you seen your father?

419
00:23:31,818 --> 00:23:33,770
He told me he was going to the church.

420
00:23:33,836 --> 00:23:37,162
Well, Gail, people from that church got
back 20 minutes ago.

421
00:23:38,037 --> 00:23:38,773
Eric?

422
00:23:39,247 --> 00:23:40,581
Mom, we'll find Dad.

423
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:44,493
--Jake, take your people to the mine.
Leave us 10.
--I'll go with you, Jake.

424
00:23:45,187 --> 00:23:48,013
After 27 years, nobody knows
that mine the way I do.

425
00:23:48,288 --> 00:23:50,072
I guess you can fit 11 people now.

426
00:23:51,487 --> 00:23:52,422
Yeah, make it 12.

427
00:23:52,978 --> 00:23:53,950
It's my place--

428
00:23:54,197 --> 00:23:55,171
I should be there.

429
00:23:55,938 --> 00:23:57,263
Yeah, let's go.

430
00:23:59,998 --> 00:24:00,812
Hey.

431
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,161
We're going to be okay.

432
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:16,452
Hang on.

433
00:24:26,876 --> 00:24:30,110
--That smells good.
--Oh, no, no, I'll get it.

434
00:24:36,218 --> 00:24:37,160
Oh!

435
00:24:38,167 --> 00:24:40,703
--I am so sorry.
--Damn it.

436
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:42,162
Oh, that looks bad.

437
00:24:42,168 --> 00:24:43,450
Look, go in the kitchen right now

438
00:24:43,457 --> 00:24:44,853
and run cold water over it.

439
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,750
It'll stop it before the blisters.

440
00:24:47,176 --> 00:24:48,482
I'll clean up this mess.

441
00:24:55,896 --> 00:24:57,340
--What happened?
--She...

442
00:24:58,928 --> 00:24:59,940
I burnt my hand.

443
00:25:00,445 --> 00:25:01,373
You left her alone?

444
00:25:02,518 --> 00:25:03,693
She's fine.

445
00:25:12,528 --> 00:25:13,581
Is he okay?

446
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,161
He'll live.

447
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:29,470
I can only get 12 down
on the elevator at a time!

448
00:25:29,475 --> 00:25:30,871
That's the best I can do!

449
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:33,311
Shep, we have to seal the entrance.

450
00:25:33,315 --> 00:25:34,323
There's no door, Jake.

451
00:25:34,446 --> 00:25:36,140
Well, we can't just let the rain
pour down the shaft.

452
00:25:36,148 --> 00:25:37,070
These people won't be safe.

453
00:25:37,075 --> 00:25:39,371
--We won't be safe.
--Well, how do we seal it?

454
00:25:39,475 --> 00:25:41,471
I don't know, but it's a mine.

455
00:25:41,755 --> 00:25:44,573
--You got dynamite, right?
--Whoa, whoa...

456
00:25:45,227 --> 00:25:48,832
--We put charges here, here, here...
--Are you crazy?

457
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,610
How do we know we won't bring
the whole thing down on top of us?

458
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:53,912
We don't.

459
00:26:53,287 --> 00:26:55,783
I am going to the little girls' room.

460
00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:59,210
--Hey, where is that?
--Right up the stairs.

461
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,742
--Right there, see?
--Good to know.

462
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:13,720
Straight back!

463
00:27:14,937 --> 00:27:18,131
--Eric, any sign of Dad?
--No, not yet.

464
00:27:18,326 --> 00:27:19,680
Checked the church, Main Street.

465
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:21,622
We're going through every inch
of Town Hall right now.

466
00:27:22,236 --> 00:27:23,250
Listen, Eric,

467
00:27:23,496 --> 00:27:25,280
I'm going to need you
to bring a crew over here

468
00:27:25,285 --> 00:27:27,101
and dig us out when this thing's over.

469
00:27:27,107 --> 00:27:28,693
What? What? Why?

470
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:30,830
--We're ready, Jake!
--Are you crazy?

471
00:27:30,838 --> 00:27:33,792
Just dig us out-- and find Dad, okay?

472
00:27:34,146 --> 00:27:35,072
Let's go.

473
00:28:10,426 --> 00:28:12,261
Mr. Hawkins, did my father come through here?

474
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:13,933
No, I haven't seen him.

475
00:28:15,117 --> 00:28:18,232
--Mom, check the offices again.
--Maybe we missed something.

476
00:28:18,236 --> 00:28:19,472
I'll go check out the parking lot.

477
00:28:19,937 --> 00:28:24,240
--Look, we'll find him, okay?
--Okay. Be careful. Be careful.

478
00:28:28,858 --> 00:28:29,910
Could you use some help, ma'am?

479
00:28:30,217 --> 00:28:31,772
No, we need you on the radio.

480
00:28:32,018 --> 00:28:35,160
You know, I can't get this old thing to work.

481
00:28:36,176 --> 00:28:37,221
--Okay, come.
--Fine.

482
00:28:37,436 --> 00:28:38,330
Please.

483
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:14,210
You are not in my house.

484
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:16,391
Get off my property, right now.

485
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:18,912
And my property goes all the way down the hill.

486
00:29:19,777 --> 00:29:20,810
You need to get back to town.

487
00:29:20,957 --> 00:29:22,632
The radiation's coming from Denver.

488
00:29:24,147 --> 00:29:25,040
I'm not leaving here.

489
00:29:25,045 --> 00:29:26,740
My parents are on their way back.

490
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,753
--You talked to them?
--No, freak, the phones are dead.

491
00:29:30,756 --> 00:29:32,730
But I'm not leaving here without them.

492
00:29:34,088 --> 00:29:35,982
All right, stay inside,

493
00:29:35,986 --> 00:29:36,950
tape up the windows,

494
00:29:37,045 --> 00:29:38,253
and don't use the water.

495
00:29:39,356 --> 00:29:41,612
--Don't tell me what to do.
--I'm serious, Skylar.

496
00:29:41,616 --> 00:29:42,582
Stay inside.

497
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:51,723
Dale?

498
00:29:51,976 --> 00:29:53,022
Dale, stop!

499
00:29:54,008 --> 00:29:54,930
Please.

500
00:29:59,418 --> 00:30:00,470
Stay here.

501
00:30:02,235 --> 00:30:03,540
It's not safe out there.

502
00:30:06,936 --> 00:30:08,370
Please stay here.

503
00:30:31,066 --> 00:30:32,321
Jody, where you at?

504
00:30:32,328 --> 00:30:33,130
All right, everybody...

505
00:30:33,136 --> 00:30:34,260
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

506
00:30:35,608 --> 00:30:37,042
Take some of that out, all right?

507
00:30:37,736 --> 00:30:39,723
Seal the entrance, not cause a cave-in.

508
00:30:41,146 --> 00:30:41,892
Hey.

509
00:30:42,347 --> 00:30:43,752
Where'd you learn how to do that?

510
00:30:44,547 --> 00:30:45,600
I knew a guy once.

511
00:30:46,425 --> 00:30:47,992
Did you blow him up?

512
00:31:01,285 --> 00:31:03,081
Hello? Is anyone here?

513
00:31:04,057 --> 00:31:06,172
--How does that look?
--It's good, that'll do.

514
00:31:07,296 --> 00:31:09,773
--How we coming, Gray?
--This is the last of 'em.

515
00:31:10,117 --> 00:31:12,220
--I'm almost done here.
--Same here.

516
00:31:12,655 --> 00:31:14,001
This is Emily Sullivan.

517
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:16,023
We're at the Richmond Ranch with Bonnie.

518
00:31:17,118 --> 00:31:18,292
Please, help us.

519
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:22,730
Can you hear me?
Is there anybody there?

520
00:31:22,818 --> 00:31:23,662
What was that?

521
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:24,971
Did you hear that?

522
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:26,973
--Somebody's on the radio.
--This is Emily Sullivan.

523
00:31:26,975 --> 00:31:29,220
--I'm at the Richmond Ranch.
--Everybody be quiet!

524
00:31:29,226 --> 00:31:30,282
There are men here with guns.

525
00:31:30,286 --> 00:31:33,192
I think they might have
killed the sheriff. Hello?

526
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:35,420
Can you hear me?

527
00:31:38,408 --> 00:31:40,280
Emily! Emily!

528
00:31:42,428 --> 00:31:43,630
Emily, can you hear me?

529
00:31:44,258 --> 00:31:45,163
Emily.

530
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:46,402
Come in, come in.

531
00:31:46,678 --> 00:31:47,762
Come in, can you hear me?

532
00:31:49,148 --> 00:31:50,503
Is there anyone out there?

533
00:31:56,537 --> 00:31:57,702
Is there anyone on this channel?

534
00:31:57,937 --> 00:31:58,940
Can anyone here me?

535
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,682
Shep, give me your keys.

536
00:32:01,927 --> 00:32:05,250
--Jake, it's gonna start raining any minute now.
--Give me your keys, I can make it.

537
00:32:05,436 --> 00:32:07,422
--All right.
--Jake, you're out of your mind.

538
00:32:08,116 --> 00:32:10,603
Gray, get everybody down there, all right?

539
00:32:15,256 --> 00:32:16,531
--Hey, Jake?
--What?

540
00:32:22,717 --> 00:32:23,683
When everybody's down,

541
00:32:23,685 --> 00:32:24,761
say "all clear."

542
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:26,733
"All clear," okay?

543
00:32:42,437 --> 00:32:44,521
Almost ready, Jake, stand by.

544
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,303
Come on, come on.

545
00:32:53,106 --> 00:32:53,693
Jake?

546
00:32:54,477 --> 00:32:55,723
We're all clear.

547
00:33:03,077 --> 00:33:07,181
Johnston? Johnston?

548
00:33:15,005 --> 00:33:16,132
Gail...

549
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:23,221
Oh, my God.

550
00:33:24,516 --> 00:33:25,642
Mr. Hawkins!

551
00:33:26,318 --> 00:33:27,592
Mr. Hawkins!

552
00:33:28,266 --> 00:33:29,591
Mr. Hawkins!

553
00:33:33,618 --> 00:33:34,753
Where's the brother?

554
00:33:41,047 --> 00:33:42,293
Where the hell's the girl?

555
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:48,781
I think they might have killed...

556
00:33:48,995 --> 00:33:50,711
I think they might have killed the sheriffs.

557
00:34:04,448 --> 00:34:05,920
Please, help us.

558
00:34:21,488 --> 00:34:23,272
Hello. This is Emily Sullivan.

559
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:25,682
I'm looking for the Jericho Police Department.

560
00:34:28,906 --> 00:34:29,592
Can you hear me?

561
00:34:29,597 --> 00:34:30,951
Is there anyone out there?

562
00:34:34,326 --> 00:34:35,712
Is there anybody on this channel?

563
00:34:36,098 --> 00:34:37,202
There are men here with guns.

564
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:38,983
I think they might have killed the sheriff.

565
00:34:44,285 --> 00:34:45,563
Please, somebody help us.

566
00:34:54,087 --> 00:34:55,381
Run, Emily,

567
00:34:55,588 --> 00:34:56,361
run.

568
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,231
Hey! Hey!

569
00:35:04,107 --> 00:35:04,560
Stop!

570
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:05,500
Stop!

571
00:35:08,048 --> 00:35:09,852
Think this through! Let her go!

572
00:35:11,037 --> 00:35:11,651
No.

573
00:35:12,085 --> 00:35:13,481
We just want gas.

574
00:35:14,425 --> 00:35:16,361
Supplies, that's all this is about.

575
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:18,200
It's just about fuel.

576
00:35:18,518 --> 00:35:20,070
Let her go.

577
00:35:22,975 --> 00:35:23,832
Look.

578
00:35:29,038 --> 00:35:31,262
Please, please, let her go.

579
00:35:33,478 --> 00:35:34,292
No.

580
00:35:34,388 --> 00:35:35,780
Is this what you want to see?

581
00:35:36,476 --> 00:35:38,222
Are you ready to talk now, Miss?

582
00:35:39,507 --> 00:35:40,840
Please, let her go.

583
00:36:11,846 --> 00:36:12,350
April...

584
00:36:12,618 --> 00:36:13,430
April, come here.

585
00:36:16,478 --> 00:36:18,210
Hey, Dad, can you tell me what happened?

586
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,710
Sit down.
Here, sit him down.

587
00:36:19,855 --> 00:36:21,873
I just found him on the floor in his office.

588
00:36:24,287 --> 00:36:25,111
Did you hit your head?

589
00:36:26,665 --> 00:36:27,481
All right.

590
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:36,701
Bonnie, take him to the storm cellar now!

591
00:36:36,706 --> 00:36:37,710
Go, guys, go!

592
00:36:38,885 --> 00:36:40,443
Emily, we've got to get inside.

593
00:36:42,307 --> 00:36:43,861
Emily? Emily, hey.

594
00:36:44,145 --> 00:36:45,161
It's going to be okay

595
00:36:45,575 --> 00:36:46,323
All right? I promise.

596
00:36:46,326 --> 00:36:48,442
Everything is going to be okay, all right?

597
00:36:48,447 --> 00:36:50,302
We've got to gin now, babe.

598
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:51,972
Babe?

599
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:56,113
We've got to get inside
before the rain, okay?

600
00:36:56,157 --> 00:36:57,170
Come with me.

601
00:36:57,886 --> 00:36:58,620
Come on.

602
00:36:59,068 --> 00:37:00,741
Run. Run.

603
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:05,121
Get inside!

604
00:37:17,957 --> 00:37:21,142
--Hey, Dad.
--Hey. How you doing?

605
00:37:21,957 --> 00:37:22,892
You comfortable?

606
00:37:23,497 --> 00:37:24,892
Just like camping.

607
00:37:25,475 --> 00:37:26,802
You hate camping.

608
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:28,213
Yep.

609
00:37:32,105 --> 00:37:33,273
Where's Allison?

610
00:37:34,015 --> 00:37:37,200
--She's up in her room.
--Samuel, go get Ali.

611
00:37:37,207 --> 00:37:38,252
Yes, sir.

612
00:37:43,276 --> 00:37:45,251
--Tell her I'm home.
--Yes, sir.

613
00:37:47,395 --> 00:37:48,841
Robert. Robert.

614
00:37:50,676 --> 00:37:52,982
--What's happening out there?
--I don't know.

615
00:37:53,676 --> 00:37:54,680
You know.

616
00:37:55,276 --> 00:37:57,031
--You always know something.
--Hey, hey...

617
00:37:57,928 --> 00:38:00,300
You are alive, Darcy,

618
00:38:00,617 --> 00:38:01,511
okay?

619
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:03,142
And the kids are safe.

620
00:38:05,055 --> 00:38:07,010
You know, don't ask me questions.

621
00:38:39,035 --> 00:38:40,901
I think my mom died yesterday.

622
00:38:45,868 --> 00:38:48,550
I think my mom died yesterday, too.

623
00:39:13,197 --> 00:39:14,212
I thought you were gone.

624
00:39:17,347 --> 00:39:19,242
--Emily...
--Why are you here?

625
00:39:22,005 --> 00:39:23,332
Trying to keep you safe.

626
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:27,432
It's never safe around you.
