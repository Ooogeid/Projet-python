3
00:00:25,602 --> 00:00:27,040
Don't wake up Fry.

4
00:00:30,124 --> 00:00:32,049
My roommate's sleeping!

5
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:35,025
Wake up already!

6
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:38,279
I'm about to get down and funky
with this ladybot,

7
00:00:38,404 --> 00:00:41,933
and I'd appreciate it if as many people
as possible could know about it.

8
00:00:42,171 --> 00:00:44,117
Now can we get some privacy?!

9
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:55,171
Back it on up.

10
00:01:06,646 --> 00:01:09,716
Okay, Hambone break's over.
Back to the bedroom!

11
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,457
Wake up and feel the coffee!

12
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,378
I'm late for work again!

13
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,341
Sorry I'm late.

14
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:36,071
Look who decided to show up.

15
00:01:36,285 --> 00:01:38,425
I've had it with your tardiness.

16
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,893
I expect you to arrive
the same time as everyone else.

17
00:01:42,318 --> 00:01:44,520
Wait a second.
Leela's not here yet.

18
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:45,910
She left a while ago.

19
00:01:46,035 --> 00:01:48,316
She said some idiot was taking her
to lunch for her birthday.

20
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:50,867
I'm late!

21
00:01:57,975 --> 00:02:01,413
Since you got stood up, I thought
this might cheer you up a notch.

22
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:02,851
That's not necessary.

23
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:05,238
<i>What day is today</i>

24
00:02:05,454 --> 00:02:08,169
- <i>It's Leela's birthday</i>
- Please stop.

25
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,880
<i>What a day for a birthday</i>

26
00:02:11,154 --> 00:02:13,257
I really would like you
to stop singing.

27
00:02:15,087 --> 00:02:18,179
You want to buy
a slice of birthday cake for $11.95?

28
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:19,222
Please.

29
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:23,044
Nice cake.
Sorry I'm late.

30
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:25,314
Where have you...
It's fine.

31
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,604
You're not mad?

32
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:27,667
I was.

33
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:29,970
But then I realized
it's actually my fault

34
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:32,401
for thinking you might be
on time for once.

35
00:02:32,716 --> 00:02:34,900
Anyhow, I ate both our lunches.

36
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:38,074
You ordered the lobster pileup.
It wasn't cheap.

37
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:47,204
Please, let me make it up to you.

38
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:50,419
I'll treat you to a fancy birthday
dinner tonight at Cavern on the Green.

39
00:02:51,382 --> 00:02:53,625
That'll be the nicest place
I've ever been stood up.

40
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,260
Not this time. No matter what happens,
I swear I'll be there.

41
00:02:57,515 --> 00:02:59,303
Guys, guys! Hedonismbot

42
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:03,061
is finally gonna settle down
and marry a nice house in the suburbs!

43
00:03:03,186 --> 00:03:04,163
But tonight,

44
00:03:04,288 --> 00:03:08,210
he's having the girls gone
wildest bachelor party of all time!

45
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:12,750
Cares?
I'm having dinner with leela.

46
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,778
Just go to your stupid party.

47
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,406
We can have dinner
on my birthday some other year.

48
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:21,317
I can throw up
on a stripper anytime.

49
00:03:21,622 --> 00:03:23,676
Tonight, I want to not throw up...

50
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,079
On you.

51
00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:26,372
Really?

52
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,557
Your loss.

53
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:30,293
Professor, you're my wingman!

54
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,600
Very well.

55
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:34,291
Cubert, fetch my drinking teeth.

56
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,345
I just have
to sign Leela's birthday card.

57
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:43,379
How do you spell "XO"?

58
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:46,352
It's a record-your-own-message card.

59
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:49,020
You don't sign it.
You leave a nude video greeting.

60
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:50,438
Does it have to be nude?

61
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:52,857
I guess not.
That never occurred to me.

62
00:03:53,118 --> 00:03:55,929
If I leave now,
record a birthday greeting on the way,

63
00:03:56,054 --> 00:03:58,102
score some fancy cologne
at the newsstand,

64
00:03:58,227 --> 00:04:01,783
- I'll be exactly on time.
- You're not going anywhere!

65
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:04,338
- But I have a date.
- You were late this morning,

66
00:04:04,463 --> 00:04:07,830
so you have to stay
and test my latest invention!

67
00:04:08,784 --> 00:04:09,784
Behold!

68
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,268
A time-traveling machine!

69
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,797
Time? I can't go back there!

70
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,759
But this time machine
only goes forward in time!

71
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,555
That way you can't accidentally
change history

72
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,349
or do something disgusting,
like sleep with your own grandmother.

73
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:27,975
I wouldn't want to do that again.

74
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,519
We're going to test it
by going forward in time one minute.

75
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:33,523
Get in.

76
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:35,746
Hurry. Let's get it over with.

77
00:04:35,871 --> 00:04:38,486
I can record Leela's birthday card
while we're in there.

78
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:42,323
Happy Birthday, Leela!

79
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,551
I'm really sorry
I'm gonna be one minute late,

80
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:47,178
'cause we're testing
the Professor's dumb time machine...

81
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:50,039
I'll just nudge us forward exactly

82
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,844
one minute into the...

83
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:54,710
My card!

84
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:01,551
Did we go too far?

85
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:03,013
What time is it?

86
00:05:03,546 --> 00:05:05,373
The year 10,000.

87
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:16,335
Oh, dear.
I mean, oh, my.

88
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,921
The year 10,000?

89
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:20,401
But I promised Leela
I'd be on time for dinner!

90
00:05:20,526 --> 00:05:23,865
Relax, Fry.
Everyone we ever knew died

91
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,395
thousands of years ago.

92
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,254
Everyone we ever knew?

93
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:29,328
I never liked those guys.

94
00:05:37,944 --> 00:05:39,652
No! They did it!

95
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:41,591
They blew it up!

96
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:44,954
And then the apes blew up
their society, too!

97
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,148
How could this happen?

98
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:51,062
And then the birds took over
and ruined their society!

99
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:52,899
And the cows, and then...

100
00:05:53,024 --> 00:05:55,438
I don't know.
Is that a slug maybe?

101
00:06:08,884 --> 00:06:10,927
While you await your "friend",

102
00:06:11,052 --> 00:06:14,386
allow me to read
from a prepared history of our Cavern.

103
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:16,908
"These unique rock formations

104
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:20,703
"were created over millions of years
by mineral-rich water

105
00:06:20,828 --> 00:06:23,265
"dripping from pores in the ceiling.

106
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,967
"Dripping and dripping,

107
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,423
"year upon year,

108
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:30,515
"century upon century..."

109
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:33,151
<i>What day is today?</i>

110
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:36,264
<i>Aren't you the loser who got stood up
at my other restaurant?</i>

111
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:38,356
Just shut up
and bring me two dinners.

112
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,486
Has anyone seen Fry's ass?

113
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,321
It's late for a date with my boot.

114
00:06:45,632 --> 00:06:48,832
Fry's not here.
Obviously, he went to that pervert party

115
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:50,827
with Bender and the Professor.

116
00:06:51,182 --> 00:06:52,728
Fry went to the party?

117
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:56,582
<i>We interrupt</i> Hypnotoad on Ice

118
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,009
<i>to bring you breaking coverage
of the disaster</i>

119
00:06:59,134 --> 00:07:01,045
<i>at Hedonismbot's bachelor party.</i>

120
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,735
<i>Linda, what began as innocent fun</i>

121
00:07:04,962 --> 00:07:07,632
<i>ended in tragedy tonight
when a nuclear-powered</i>

122
00:07:07,757 --> 00:07:11,135
<i>robot stripper suffered
a catastrophic reactor meltdown.</i>

123
00:07:11,392 --> 00:07:13,307
<i>There is only one survivor.</i>

124
00:07:13,568 --> 00:07:16,627
<i>Everywhere I looked,
there were piles of bodies.</i>

125
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:18,560
<i>And then the explosion struck.</i>

126
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:25,187
The three co-workers I liked
are all dead!

127
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,208
Fry stood me up and died?

128
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:28,873
I'm so angry!

129
00:07:29,197 --> 00:07:31,003
I mean, I'm so sad!

130
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:33,438
But I'm still pretty angry!

131
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:35,405
But also sad.

132
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,874
- Can I be both?
- It's what he'd want.

133
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:39,358
Then that's what I am!

134
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,627
Man, the future is a total craphole,

135
00:07:50,843 --> 00:07:53,665
and whoever lives here
is a crap-faced sack of crap!

136
00:07:54,027 --> 00:07:56,392
- No offense, fellas.
- Don't sweat it, man.

137
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:59,295
I'll never see Leela again.

138
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,911
No,
without a backwards time machine,

139
00:08:02,036 --> 00:08:03,691
we're stuck in this craphole.

140
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,818
- Dude, give it a rest.
- Hold on!

141
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,643
I've got it!
We can't go back in time,

142
00:08:08,768 --> 00:08:11,692
but we can keep going forward
until people invent

143
00:08:11,817 --> 00:08:13,603
the backwards time machine.

144
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:15,828
- And then we can go home.
- Hit it.

145
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:20,997
<i>In the year 105105</i>

146
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:24,963
<i>If man is still alive</i>

147
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,758
<i>If robot can survive</i>

148
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:31,958
<i>They may find...</i>

149
00:08:34,017 --> 00:08:37,526
<i>In the year 252525</i>

150
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:41,354
<i>The backwards time machine
still won't have arrived</i>

151
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:45,316
<i>In all the world,
there's only one technology</i>

152
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:49,041
<i>A rusty sword
for practicing proctology</i>

153
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:52,944
<i>In a future year that ends with 20</i>

154
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:57,036
<i>A shlubby merman's gonna try
to get chummy</i>

155
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:00,498
<i>He may look like a watery wimp</i>

156
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:04,961
<i>When in fact
he's a bloodthirsty shrimp!</i>

157
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:08,172
<i>In the year one million and a half</i>

158
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,468
<i>Humankind is enslaved by giraffe</i>

159
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:16,153
<i>Man must pay for all his misdeeds</i>

160
00:09:16,627 --> 00:09:19,956
<i>When the treetops
are stripped of their leaves</i>

161
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:32,546
Sometimes I can't believe
how successful Planet Express

162
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,034
became once the Professor was killed
and you seized control.

163
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:38,838
There were tough times,
but we all pulled together.

164
00:09:38,963 --> 00:09:42,147
I've been crunching the numbers
on our trans-galactic strategy...

165
00:09:42,272 --> 00:09:45,528
What are you doing here?
I laid you off 20 years ago.

166
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:51,514
The claws can't flee
like they used to.

167
00:09:52,163 --> 00:09:55,871
Success is nice,
but I do kind of miss the old days.

168
00:10:13,055 --> 00:10:15,281
May we help you, strange ones?

169
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:18,243
We are travelers from the past,
my good runt.

170
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:19,411
I see.

171
00:10:19,695 --> 00:10:23,166
Since your time,
human evolution has diverged.

172
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:25,106
There are we,

173
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:28,114
advanced in intellect and morality.

174
00:10:28,438 --> 00:10:29,714
And the dumblocks,

175
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,715
stupid, vicious brutes
who live underground.

176
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:35,008
Advanced in intellect, you say?

177
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:38,054
Have you invented
a backwards time machine?

178
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:40,946
No, but if we apply
our superior minds,

179
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:43,893
we could perfect such
a device within five years.

180
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:45,217
See you then!

181
00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:51,985
We're back for our time machine!

182
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:06,583
What's this era
in human history like?

183
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,323
The machines...

184
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:11,653
We built them to make our lives easier,
but they rebelled.

185
00:11:11,778 --> 00:11:14,799
They won't stop
until every human is dead.

186
00:11:15,072 --> 00:11:18,089
This seems like a nice future.
Let's just stay here.

187
00:11:18,214 --> 00:11:20,856
We could settle down
on that mountain of skulls.

188
00:11:24,477 --> 00:11:26,999
That place had a gorgeous view
of Blood Lake!

189
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:32,150
Greetings, time travelers.

190
00:11:32,318 --> 00:11:35,320
Stupid jerks!
Wouldn't let me stay in the good future.

191
00:11:35,488 --> 00:11:37,272
How did you know
we're time travelers?

192
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:39,986
We, too,
study the time travel enigma.

193
00:11:40,111 --> 00:11:43,552
We have perfected a method
using negative-mass neutrino fields

194
00:11:43,677 --> 00:11:46,730
that allows us
to travel backwards in time.

195
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:50,293
- My name's Hubert.
- All right! We can go home!

196
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,232
We can talk
of our research tomorrow.

197
00:11:55,357 --> 00:11:57,467
Men are very rare in our society.

198
00:11:57,635 --> 00:12:00,470
Even very old and stupid males
are prized.

199
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:04,307
Tonight, please be the guests of honor
at our fertility banquet.

200
00:12:05,047 --> 00:12:08,528
There's certainly no harm
in a fertility banquet.

201
00:12:08,653 --> 00:12:10,528
I could eat.
And fertilize.

202
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:13,588
Very well.
Let us anoint our guests in oil

203
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:15,401
without using our hands.

204
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,845
So we can stay
in the future you like,

205
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,656
but not the future I like?

206
00:12:20,002 --> 00:12:21,002
Next.

207
00:12:22,672 --> 00:12:24,869
I was about to close the deal!

208
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:27,583
Bender, they had
a backwards time machine!

209
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,831
The other place had
a lot of good things, too!

210
00:12:29,956 --> 00:12:31,835
Did you even see
that mountain of skulls?

211
00:12:32,003 --> 00:12:33,253
Why, you!

212
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:35,641
No, you didn't.

213
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:41,928
Stop! Somewhere, some time,
Leela is waiting for me.

214
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,598
We need to keep looking
for a backwards time machine.

215
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:45,844
Fry's right.

216
00:12:45,969 --> 00:12:47,930
Yes. We have to work together,

217
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,968
not have this fight,
which I was definitely winning.

218
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:54,524
The year one billion.

219
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:56,718
I've got a feeling
this could be exactly

220
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:59,237
the point in time
we've been looking for!

221
00:13:05,015 --> 00:13:07,761
In fact, all life is extinct.

222
00:13:09,264 --> 00:13:10,810
So let's keep going forward.

223
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,507
It's no use.

224
00:13:12,632 --> 00:13:13,880
Earth is dead.

225
00:13:14,152 --> 00:13:16,996
This is the end of all things.

226
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,059
The Cavern on the Green.

227
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:41,899
I made it, Leela.

228
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:44,526
Sorry I'm a billion years late.

229
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:59,745
You'll get your alimony check, Cubert.
Now get lost!

230
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,123
Chill out.
I'm just here to see Amy.

231
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:04,385
Move it, boy toy.

232
00:14:04,848 --> 00:14:07,347
Granny's taking you
to Atlantic City.

233
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:13,363
I don't know why you ever married
that pig-nosed punk.

234
00:14:13,488 --> 00:14:16,325
I don't know, either.
I'm married to the job now.

235
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,842
I used to think there was someone
for me, but...

236
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:21,653
How odd.

237
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:25,004
It's one of those old
record-your-own-message birthday cards.

238
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:29,861
<i>Happy Birthday, Leela! I'm really sorry
I'm gonna be one minute late,</i>

239
00:14:29,986 --> 00:14:32,423
<i>'cause we're testing
the Professor's dumb time machine...</i>

240
00:14:32,715 --> 00:14:36,196
<i>But, you know,
happy birthday and all, and...</i>

241
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:37,961
<i>I love you.</i>

242
00:14:39,183 --> 00:14:40,183
<i>My card!</i>

243
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:46,253
My whole life I've been mad at him,

244
00:14:46,378 --> 00:14:48,026
and it wasn't his fault.

245
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,399
<i>Dear Fry,</i>

246
00:15:33,528 --> 00:15:35,215
<i>our time together was short</i>

247
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:37,647
<i>but it was the best time of my life.</i>

248
00:15:47,204 --> 00:15:49,783
You know, all in all,
I had a good life.

249
00:15:49,951 --> 00:15:52,039
What do you say
the three of us grab a six-pack

250
00:15:52,164 --> 00:15:54,655
- and watch the universe end?
- Hear! Hear!

251
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,939
That's basically
what I do every day.

252
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:01,752
To the end of the universe!

253
00:16:15,935 --> 00:16:18,642
So long, Earth.
Thanks for the air and whatnot.

254
00:16:29,593 --> 00:16:31,520
What was the purpose of life,
anyway?

255
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:32,720
Who knows.

256
00:16:32,845 --> 00:16:35,920
Probably some hogwash
about the human spirit.

257
00:16:36,045 --> 00:16:37,122
Sounds about right.

258
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:42,419
The stars are receding.

259
00:16:42,774 --> 00:16:45,012
Oh, the vast emptiness!

260
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:48,915
Yeah, yeah, I can take a hint.

261
00:16:53,938 --> 00:16:57,225
The last proton
should be decaying about now.

262
00:16:57,393 --> 00:16:58,643
Bye, last proton.

263
00:16:58,986 --> 00:16:59,986
And...

264
00:17:00,556 --> 00:17:03,475
here we are.
The end of the universe.

265
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:12,882
Well, now what?

266
00:17:13,423 --> 00:17:15,201
- You guys want to talk?
- No, thanks.

267
00:17:18,331 --> 00:17:20,832
- Did anyone else see that?
- Unbelievable!

268
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,004
It's a second Big Bang!

269
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:30,082
My God,

270
00:17:30,563 --> 00:17:32,052
is it possible?

271
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,163
It must be possible. It's happening.

272
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:36,014
By the way, what's happening?

273
00:17:36,182 --> 00:17:37,936
It appears this universe

274
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:40,628
is exactly identical to the old one.

275
00:17:40,877 --> 00:17:44,087
If so, we just need
to keep going forward

276
00:17:44,212 --> 00:17:46,250
in time to the point when we left!

277
00:17:51,114 --> 00:17:52,635
The Earth is born!

278
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:01,899
Ladies and gentlemen, the Moon!

279
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,416
Look.

280
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:05,489
The first fish to crawl up on land.

281
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,799
It was coming right at us!
You saw it.

282
00:18:08,924 --> 00:18:10,432
I'm gonna grab another beer.

283
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:14,215
You're missing the dinosaurs!

284
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,745
It's okay.
They're not going anywhere.

285
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:18,640
Where'd they go?

286
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:29,301
- Now, what's going on there?
- History.

287
00:18:29,426 --> 00:18:31,960
Hang on.
I just want to make one stop.

288
00:18:57,725 --> 00:18:59,271
Easy. Easy.

289
00:18:59,995 --> 00:19:02,100
Taking her in for a landing.

290
00:19:02,268 --> 00:19:03,682
One year to go.

291
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:05,312
Six months.

292
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,938
I'm almost there, Leela.

293
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:08,881
One month...
Two weeks...

294
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:10,405
One hour...

295
00:19:10,686 --> 00:19:12,308
30 seconds...

296
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:14,416
And here we...

297
00:19:17,165 --> 00:19:18,959
Give me the keys, Magoo!

298
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:25,305
We'll have
to bring her around again.

299
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:39,346
Just slow it down.
I'll shoot Hitler out the window.

300
00:19:40,738 --> 00:19:43,808
Darn!
I hit Eleanor Roosevelt by mistake.

301
00:19:45,236 --> 00:19:47,106
Nearing our era again.

302
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:48,850
Here we go.

303
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:50,872
Careful this time.

304
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:52,947
Careful.

305
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:57,077
We're going to test it by going forward
in time one minute.

306
00:19:58,014 --> 00:20:00,674
- Get in.
- Okay. Hurry. Let's get it over with.

307
00:20:03,913 --> 00:20:07,749
This new universe is about
ten feet lower than our old one.

308
00:20:11,764 --> 00:20:14,186
We took care
of the time travel paradox.

309
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,383
- All right!
- Yabba-dabba-doo!

310
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:19,183
I'm late for dinner with Leela.

311
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:23,771
Welcome to Cavern on the Green.

312
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:26,063
May I offer you some meat loaf
while you wait?

313
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:28,186
Sorry I'm late!

314
00:20:28,354 --> 00:20:30,021
Actually, you're on time.

315
00:20:30,592 --> 00:20:31,398
Really?

316
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:34,281
I have to admit,
I was afraid you wouldn't make it.

317
00:20:35,071 --> 00:20:36,541
That was the old Fry.

318
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:38,238
He's dead now.

319
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:41,438
Happy Birthday, Leela.

320
00:20:41,784 --> 00:20:44,444
I got you a card,
but I guess I kind of lost it.

321
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,092
That's okay.
I don't really like cards.

322
00:20:47,337 --> 00:20:49,672
What I'll remember
is our time together.
