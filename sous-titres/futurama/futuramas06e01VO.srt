1
0:0:2,824 --> 0:0:6,422
<i>On the count of three,
you will awake feeling refreshed,</i>

2
0:0:6,668 --> 0:0:9,967
<i>as if Futurama
had never been cancelled by idiots,</i>

3
0:0:10,233 --> 0:0:12,365
<i>then brought back by bigger idiots.</i>

4
0:0:12,822 --> 0:0:13,822
One...

5
0:0:14,100 --> 0:0:15,100
two...

6
0:0:23,618 --> 0:0:25,997
Professor, my fry-fro is all frizzy.

7
0:0:27,403 --> 0:0:29,362
Well, that's all.
Also,

8
0:0:29,530 --> 0:0:31,238
I'm covered with severe burns.

9
0:0:31,406 --> 0:0:32,782
So? What of it?

10
0:0:33,883 --> 0:0:35,618
Why is... those things?

11
0:0:36,647 --> 0:0:38,454
You mean you don't remember?

12
0:0:38,622 --> 0:0:41,498
Nope, nothing.
It's like when I passed out in college.

13
0:0:41,623 --> 0:0:44,460
Except no one drew magic marker penises
on my forehead.

14
0:0:45,319 --> 0:0:46,901
I suppose it's for the best,

15
0:0:47,26 --> 0:0:50,194
considering the unbearable horrors
you've endured.

16
0:0:50,319 --> 0:0:52,343
Let's never speak of it again.

17
0:0:52,819 --> 0:0:54,870
It all began a few days ago.

18
0:0:55,96 --> 0:0:57,14
<i>We were interstellar fugitives,</i>

19
0:0:57,474 --> 0:0:59,58
<i>on the run from the law.</i>

20
0:0:59,810 --> 0:1:2,373
Fire all weapons
and open a hailing frequency

21
0:1:2,498 --> 0:1:4,230
for my victory yodel.

22
0:1:16,76 --> 0:1:19,171
<i>And so,
as you and Leela kissed good-bye</i>

23
0:1:19,296 --> 0:1:21,831
<i>in a tender display
of tonguesmanship,</i>

24
0:1:21,999 --> 0:1:24,686
<i>we plunged into a massive wormhole,</i>

25
0:1:25,14 --> 0:1:27,287
<i>never to be seen again!</i>

26
0:1:30,966 --> 0:1:32,49
Yeah, we're back.

27
0:1:34,177 --> 0:1:36,554
Sweet coincidence of Port-Au-Prince!

28
0:1:36,722 --> 0:1:39,140
- We're back at Earth!
- Of course!

29
0:1:39,308 --> 0:1:41,355
That was the Panama wormhole,

30
0:1:41,480 --> 0:1:43,656
Earth's central channel
for shipping.

31
0:1:45,85 --> 0:1:46,363
How humorous.

32
0:1:46,488 --> 0:1:49,808
Yes! It's sort
of a comedy central channel.

33
0:1:49,933 --> 0:1:51,193
And we're on it now!

34
0:1:52,438 --> 0:1:53,458
I get it!

35
0:2:4,291 --> 0:2:6,388
We've lost power
to the forward gameboy!

36
0:2:6,513 --> 0:2:7,877
Mario not responding!

37
0:2:8,45 --> 0:2:9,712
Brace for emergency landing!

38
0:2:10,5 --> 0:2:12,673
Roger that!
Activate safety spheres!

39
0:2:18,764 --> 0:2:21,348
Also, mine has air-conditioning.

40
0:2:38,867 --> 0:2:41,354
Yet thanks
to my trusty safety sphere,

41
0:2:41,479 --> 0:2:44,413
I "surblibed"
with only "tribial" brain "dablage."

42
0:2:44,581 --> 0:2:47,897
- And the others?
- Right here behind this horror cloth.

43
0:2:48,378 --> 0:2:49,335
Are they dead?

44
0:2:50,733 --> 0:2:51,754
Much worse.

45
0:3:30,43 --> 0:3:31,519
Move over, God!

46
0:3:31,644 --> 0:3:33,605
Prepare for rebirth!

47
0:3:36,935 --> 0:3:38,166
Wrong switch.

48
0:3:47,519 --> 0:3:49,176
Come on, stem cells,

49
0:3:49,301 --> 0:3:52,305
work your astounding
scientific nonsense!

50
0:3:52,727 --> 0:3:54,24
Fetal stem cells?

51
0:3:54,192 --> 0:3:55,651
Aren't those controversial?

52
0:3:55,819 --> 0:3:57,333
In your time, yes.

53
0:3:57,458 --> 0:3:59,213
But nowadays, shut up!

54
0:3:59,447 --> 0:4:1,814
Besides, these are adult stem cells,

55
0:4:1,939 --> 0:4:4,228
harvested from perfectly
healthy adults

56
0:4:4,353 --> 0:4:6,704
whom I killed for their stem cells.

57
0:4:17,674 --> 0:4:19,8
Hermes Conrad!

58
0:4:23,135 --> 0:4:25,116
I'm dripping with placenta!

59
0:4:25,241 --> 0:4:26,932
Good thing it's casual Friday.

60
0:4:30,491 --> 0:4:31,437
Amy Wong!

61
0:4:32,741 --> 0:4:33,878
Baby soft!

62
0:4:34,686 --> 0:4:35,835
Indeed!

63
0:4:37,839 --> 0:4:39,111
Dr. Zoidberg!

64
0:4:39,279 --> 0:4:40,973
Hermes, my friend!

65
0:4:41,208 --> 0:4:43,786
Let me cut off your umbilical cord.

66
0:4:47,287 --> 0:4:48,403
And the rest!

67
0:4:49,432 --> 0:4:50,685
We're back in business!

68
0:4:50,810 --> 0:4:52,900
Over my dead body.

69
0:4:56,334 --> 0:4:57,379
Never mind.

70
0:5:0,553 --> 0:5:2,662
Bender! Are the stem cells working?

71
0:5:6,98 --> 0:5:7,185
I'm dyin'.

72
0:5:8,345 --> 0:5:11,755
- I need mouth-to-ass resuscitation.
- I'm on it!

73
0:5:14,620 --> 0:5:15,940
It's not working!

74
0:5:17,530 --> 0:5:20,295
I die happy,
knowing you fell for that.

75
0:5:21,655 --> 0:5:23,553
His power supply is shot!

76
0:5:23,678 --> 0:5:24,990
He's flatlining!

77
0:5:27,793 --> 0:5:30,120
Only one thing can keep him alive.

78
0:5:31,414 --> 0:5:32,797
Possibly this thing!

79
0:5:40,233 --> 0:5:42,260
I've never felt so energetic!

80
0:5:43,827 --> 0:5:45,503
That's because the doomsday device

81
0:5:45,628 --> 0:5:48,632
I shoved all up
in you puts out 50 gigawatts!

82
0:5:48,757 --> 0:5:50,474
That's ten times your recommended...

83
0:5:50,642 --> 0:5:52,757
Who are you, my warranty?

84
0:5:53,747 --> 0:5:54,943
That's a good...

85
0:6:0,415 --> 0:6:2,736
For God sakes, Bender!
Keep dancing!

86
0:6:3,47 --> 0:6:4,605
Keep whooping it up!

87
0:6:6,714 --> 0:6:10,476
You must burn off the doomsday energy
as fast as its produced,

88
0:6:10,601 --> 0:6:12,705
or it will build to critical levels!

89
0:6:13,703 --> 0:6:14,790
You don't mean...?

90
0:6:15,285 --> 0:6:16,285
But I do.

91
0:6:16,516 --> 0:6:19,59
If you stop partying
for a single second,

92
0:6:19,184 --> 0:6:21,778
you'll explode
and kill everyone here

93
0:6:21,903 --> 0:6:24,36
in a fireball of melted gears

94
0:6:24,161 --> 0:6:26,157
and splatter bowels!

95
0:6:27,903 --> 0:6:29,544
Sounds like a party, baby!

96
0:6:32,17 --> 0:6:33,833
Speaking of splattered bowels,

97
0:6:33,958 --> 0:6:36,528
can I cook you
a romantic dinner tonight, Leela?

98
0:6:37,145 --> 0:6:38,540
Where's Leela?

99
0:6:42,173 --> 0:6:43,215
Is she okay?

100
0:6:43,438 --> 0:6:45,487
Why hasn't she acknowledged
my dinner offer?

101
0:6:45,655 --> 0:6:49,208
Something's wrong!
She's not responding to my poking stick!

102
0:6:50,160 --> 0:6:51,452
Poke harder, damn it!

103
0:6:51,620 --> 0:6:53,846
I'm poking as hard as I can!

104
0:6:54,198 --> 0:6:55,616
I'm sorry, Fry,

105
0:6:55,862 --> 0:6:57,708
but I'm afraid Leela is in...

106
0:6:58,168 --> 0:7:0,277
An irreversible coma!

107
0:7:16,230 --> 0:7:17,976
My soul mate is gone!

108
0:7:18,246 --> 0:7:19,933
Why should I go on living?

109
0:7:20,58 --> 0:7:22,195
Because the pain slowly fades,

110
0:7:22,523 --> 0:7:24,151
but the love is forever.

111
0:7:25,904 --> 0:7:28,655
But what if I forget
the sweet sound of her voice,

112
0:7:28,823 --> 0:7:31,408
or the moist touch of her eyeball
on my lips?

113
0:7:32,308 --> 0:7:35,579
Are you still hung up
on what's her name? Move on already!

114
0:7:36,573 --> 0:7:39,333
- Maybe you're right.
- Maybe I'm always right!

115
0:7:52,23 --> 0:7:53,972
"Build-a-bot workshop"?

116
0:7:54,376 --> 0:7:56,433
It's time to start living again!

117
0:8:4,139 --> 0:8:7,57
At least it's something
to distract me from Leela.

118
0:8:14,203 --> 0:8:15,953
Now that I like, for some reason.

119
0:8:21,738 --> 0:8:23,507
I like jelly beans!

120
0:8:23,730 --> 0:8:26,3
- Do you?
- I sure do, honey.

121
0:8:26,671 --> 0:8:27,673
Come, now, Fry!

122
0:8:27,960 --> 0:8:30,269
You can't live out
this sick fantasy!

123
0:8:30,562 --> 0:8:31,969
Not without our help.

124
0:8:33,311 --> 0:8:36,628
These security tapes record everything
at planet express,

125
0:8:36,753 --> 0:8:39,226
including the ship,
shower and urinals.

126
0:8:39,394 --> 0:8:42,813
And yet, it still hasn't stopped
the elusive bathroom burglar.

127
0:8:42,981 --> 0:8:45,748
Maybe he's just trying
to feed his family.

128
0:8:47,319 --> 0:8:51,268
Computer, analyze tapes
and extract personality profile of one

129
0:8:51,393 --> 0:8:52,489
Turanga Leela.

130
0:8:52,657 --> 0:8:53,657
<i>Analyzing.</i>

131
0:8:53,893 --> 0:8:54,893
<i>Analyzing.</i>

132
0:8:55,131 --> 0:8:57,288
<i>Checking my ebay bid.
Damn it!</i>

133
0:8:57,627 --> 0:8:58,912
<i>Analyses complete.</i>

134
0:9:1,958 --> 0:9:3,470
I was nuzzling that!

135
0:9:4,2 --> 0:9:5,152
<i>Attributes transfer.</i>

136
0:9:5,277 --> 0:9:7,109
<i>Shoe size 12, etcetera.</i>

137
0:9:9,424 --> 0:9:11,91
Brace for emergency landing!

138
0:9:11,803 --> 0:9:13,677
What?
We survived the crash?

139
0:9:16,666 --> 0:9:18,599
Party people in the house say...

140
0:9:20,101 --> 0:9:21,249
This is wonderful!

141
0:9:21,374 --> 0:9:24,156
The last thing I remember,
I was dying in an explosion.

142
0:9:24,281 --> 0:9:27,566
Yet here I am in the flesh,
more alive than ever!

143
0:9:27,961 --> 0:9:28,961
Alive?

144
0:9:30,211 --> 0:9:32,362
- You better tell her, Fry.
- Tell me what?

145
0:9:32,730 --> 0:9:34,323
Anyway, my work is done.

146
0:9:34,616 --> 0:9:36,81
I'm gonna hit the showers.

147
0:9:40,25 --> 0:9:42,414
Nibbler, come give mama a hug!

148
0:9:44,10 --> 0:9:46,877
What the...
Bad Nibbler! Bad Nibbler!

149
0:9:48,421 --> 0:9:49,880
What you doing, pooper-doodle?

150
0:9:50,202 --> 0:9:51,773
It's me, Leela!

151
0:10:9,843 --> 0:10:11,318
Am I really just a robot?

152
0:10:11,735 --> 0:10:13,669
I mean, I have Leela's memories,

153
0:10:13,950 --> 0:10:15,778
her opinion of gazelles,

154
0:10:15,903 --> 0:10:17,853
majestic, her emotions...

155
0:10:18,439 --> 0:10:19,821
confused and hurt.

156
0:10:20,245 --> 0:10:22,788
I swear,
I didn't know this would happen.

157
0:10:23,132 --> 0:10:25,136
The only thing I truly know is,

158
0:10:25,604 --> 0:10:26,624
I love you.

159
0:10:27,669 --> 0:10:28,585
Her. Wait.

160
0:10:28,753 --> 0:10:29,858
Help me out here.

161
0:10:44,436 --> 0:10:46,576
- No, spank you.
- I said do it!

162
0:10:47,105 --> 0:10:48,322
The truth is, Fry,

163
0:10:48,447 --> 0:10:50,274
I still have feelings for you.

164
0:10:50,442 --> 0:10:52,259
But are they really my feelings?

165
0:10:52,494 --> 0:10:54,17
Am I just an automaton?

166
0:10:54,251 --> 0:10:56,232
Or can a machine
of sufficient complexity

167
0:10:56,357 --> 0:10:58,490
legitimately achieve consciousness?

168
0:10:58,771 --> 0:10:59,771
I agree.

169
0:10:59,951 --> 0:11:1,665
I need some time to figure this out.

170
0:11:1,886 --> 0:11:2,886
Until then...

171
0:11:3,199 --> 0:11:4,199
friends?

172
0:11:5,753 --> 0:11:7,464
Listen up, disco dummies!

173
0:11:7,589 --> 0:11:9,436
You just flunked out of Bender's

174
0:11:9,561 --> 0:11:11,425
College of Party Knowledge!

175
0:11:19,861 --> 0:11:21,291
Do the back dance,

176
0:11:21,416 --> 0:11:22,744
do the back dance.

177
0:11:26,190 --> 0:11:27,608
Good news, everyone.

178
0:11:28,41 --> 0:11:31,768
I'm going to make one final attempt
to awaken Leela.

179
0:11:33,408 --> 0:11:35,740
After all, there's always hope.

180
0:11:36,92 --> 0:11:38,564
- Really?
- No, don't get your hopes up.

181
0:11:38,822 --> 0:11:42,80
Frankly, she's just a brainless mound
of scabs and pus.

182
0:11:43,791 --> 0:11:45,329
I didn't need to hear that.

183
0:11:45,497 --> 0:11:47,557
No, and you don't need to see this.

184
0:11:49,924 --> 0:11:51,588
<i>Wake up! Wake up!</i>

185
0:12:2,180 --> 0:12:3,538
Well, that's it.

186
0:12:3,820 --> 0:12:6,683
I'm afraid traditional medicine
has failed.

187
0:12:8,269 --> 0:12:9,775
I refuse to give up!

188
0:12:10,267 --> 0:12:11,605
Wake up, Leela!
I...

189
0:12:12,107 --> 0:12:12,927
love...

190
0:12:13,52 --> 0:12:14,837
- you!
- Fry, stop.

191
0:12:15,587 --> 0:12:16,443
She's gone.

192
0:12:16,859 --> 0:12:17,925
Dr. Zoidberg,

193
0:12:18,50 --> 0:12:21,371
can you note the time
and declare the patient legally dead?

194
0:12:21,605 --> 0:12:22,605
Can I!

195
0:12:22,730 --> 0:12:24,167
That's my specialty!

196
0:12:38,297 --> 0:12:39,457
As you all know,

197
0:12:39,582 --> 0:12:42,386
Leela's living will states that,
in the event of coma,

198
0:12:42,656 --> 0:12:45,399
her body is to be fed
to the wild cyclophage,

199
0:12:45,524 --> 0:12:48,392
a highly endangered creature
that eats only cyclopses.

200
0:12:48,560 --> 0:12:50,838
Yup, that's what
her donor card says.

201
0:12:54,72 --> 0:12:55,373
Good-bye, my love.

202
0:13:2,6 --> 0:13:3,471
The beast approacheth!

203
0:13:9,338 --> 0:13:11,611
To the beat, y'all!
To the beat, y'all!

204
0:13:11,736 --> 0:13:13,917
I'm dancin' a jig
with my feet, y'all!

205
0:13:14,85 --> 0:13:15,513
Bender, cut it out!

206
0:13:15,638 --> 0:13:17,504
People are trying to have emotions!

207
0:13:17,775 --> 0:13:19,252
You think I want to party?

208
0:13:19,377 --> 0:13:20,732
I'm sick of partying!

209
0:13:21,693 --> 0:13:22,842
More partying!

210
0:13:24,470 --> 0:13:26,146
- Quiet, Bender!
- Cut it out!

211
0:13:31,352 --> 0:13:32,969
Shut the hell up!

212
0:13:40,153 --> 0:13:42,28
Bender, stop shutting the hell up!

213
0:13:42,344 --> 0:13:43,344
Oh, right.

214
0:13:43,469 --> 0:13:44,571
Leela's back,

215
0:13:44,817 --> 0:13:45,942
as if I care.

216
0:13:47,91 --> 0:13:48,227
All right, Leela!

217
0:13:50,422 --> 0:13:53,129
Thanks.
It's so nice to wake up and see...

218
0:14:0,798 --> 0:14:2,12
How is this possible?

219
0:14:2,137 --> 0:14:4,684
And can you believe
she wore a tank-top to my funeral?

220
0:14:4,809 --> 0:14:6,303
We've got to get out of here!

221
0:14:12,525 --> 0:14:14,881
No, you shut up.
We've got to get out of here!

222
0:14:28,910 --> 0:14:30,486
All aboard the party ship.

223
0:14:35,493 --> 0:14:38,236
There's no room for two captains
in this chair!

224
0:14:38,361 --> 0:14:40,532
There would be
if you'd taken a spin class

225
0:14:40,657 --> 0:14:42,506
instead of lounging around
in a coma.

226
0:14:54,590 --> 0:14:55,644
This is crazy.

227
0:14:55,812 --> 0:14:59,314
It's like I'm looking at
an exact robot duplicate of myself.

228
0:14:59,482 --> 0:15:1,261
That is what you're looking at.

229
0:15:2,447 --> 0:15:3,860
How could you do this, Fry?

230
0:15:4,544 --> 0:15:6,91
Coma... sad...

231
0:15:6,489 --> 0:15:9,33
I have to go.
This is just too freaky.

232
0:15:9,999 --> 0:15:11,593
Please don't get upset, Leela.

233
0:15:11,718 --> 0:15:13,58
She's nothing like you.

234
0:15:13,183 --> 0:15:14,253
I have to go.

235
0:15:14,378 --> 0:15:15,941
This is just too freaky.

236
0:15:22,76 --> 0:15:23,869
I need cheering up, Bender.

237
0:15:24,156 --> 0:15:26,800
I don't know.
You want to go out and party tonight?

238
0:15:26,968 --> 0:15:28,175
I hate partying.

239
0:15:28,409 --> 0:15:31,327
If only I didn't have so much crunk
in my badunkadunk.

240
0:15:33,331 --> 0:15:35,640
Why does everything I date run away?

241
0:15:36,176 --> 0:15:37,418
I love Leela.

242
0:15:37,664 --> 0:15:39,141
Always and forever.

243
0:15:39,469 --> 0:15:41,398
And if I loved robot Leela, too,

244
0:15:42,551 --> 0:15:45,422
that's only 'cause she had so much
of real Leela in her.

245
0:15:45,695 --> 0:15:47,646
I thought she loved me, too.

246
0:15:48,44 --> 0:15:51,491
- But obviously, I was wrong, as usual.
- Wrong again.

247
0:15:52,123 --> 0:15:53,118
You were right.

248
0:15:53,286 --> 0:15:55,275
Leela? Leela Leela?

249
0:15:57,323 --> 0:15:59,936
I've been thinking, fry.
If I lost you,

250
0:16:0,61 --> 0:16:1,999
I don't think I could stand it,
either.

251
0:16:2,124 --> 0:16:4,401
I'd probably build
a copy of you, too.

252
0:16:5,882 --> 0:16:9,342
As long as robo Leela's not a jealous
type like me, things will work...

253
0:16:9,510 --> 0:16:11,338
I'll kill you, you slut-clops!

254
0:16:12,722 --> 0:16:13,742
He's mine!

255
0:16:13,867 --> 0:16:15,253
Back off, missy!

256
0:16:22,732 --> 0:16:24,274
Somebody do something!

257
0:16:24,442 --> 0:16:25,673
Here, take this.

258
0:16:25,907 --> 0:16:27,736
A gun? Do-do I really need to...?

259
0:16:27,904 --> 0:16:29,516
Shoot her!
She's the robot!

260
0:16:29,641 --> 0:16:32,460
No. Shoot her!
She's the human!

261
0:16:32,742 --> 0:16:35,577
But how do I know who's the human
and who's the robot?

262
0:16:35,745 --> 0:16:37,912
- We just told you!
- Yeah, you idiot!

263
0:16:38,80 --> 0:16:39,233
Okay, fine.

264
0:16:39,358 --> 0:16:42,500
If you're gonna be like that,
I'm not shooting anyone.

265
0:16:44,630 --> 0:16:46,236
Right between the lungs.

266
0:16:46,361 --> 0:16:47,841
Man, that was close.

267
0:16:54,865 --> 0:16:56,222
I'm a robot, too!

268
0:16:57,267 --> 0:16:59,963
That explains this growth
on your drive shaft.

269
0:17:0,228 --> 0:17:2,611
- But how is this possible?
- Who knows?

270
0:17:3,471 --> 0:17:5,523
I do.
Allow me to explain

271
0:17:5,691 --> 0:17:8,510
what really happened
the day the ship crashed.

272
0:17:16,295 --> 0:17:17,786
I'll protect you, Leela.

273
0:17:17,954 --> 0:17:20,981
My love is stronger than
the vast majority of explosions.

274
0:17:23,835 --> 0:17:25,821
<i>Fry did, in fact, save Leela,</i>

275
0:17:26,47 --> 0:17:28,297
<i>though at a terrible cost
to himself.</i>

276
0:17:28,948 --> 0:17:30,840
<i>I tossed him into the stem cells,</i>

277
0:17:31,8 --> 0:17:34,854
<i>but he just bubbled away,
like phlegm on a hot sidewalk.</i>

278
0:17:35,533 --> 0:17:37,347
<i>Leela was so distraught,</i>

279
0:17:37,515 --> 0:17:40,388
<i>she went all blade runner
and built a duplicate.</i>

280
0:17:40,768 --> 0:17:43,616
<i>Then uploaded Fry's personality</i>

281
0:17:43,741 --> 0:17:46,77
<i>from the urinal surveillance tapes.</i>

282
0:17:46,202 --> 0:17:47,492
I sure love Leela.

283
0:17:50,319 --> 0:17:53,917
<i>Alas, in recreating
Fry's adorable jelly belly,</i>

284
0:17:54,42 --> 0:17:56,659
<i>she had overstuffed him
with copper wadding.</i>

285
0:17:58,995 --> 0:18:2,497
<i>The inevitable static discharge
electrocuted Leela,</i>

286
0:18:2,665 --> 0:18:5,577
<i>and destroyed both
of their short-term memories.</i>

287
0:18:6,2 --> 0:18:9,350
So that's why I'm so amazed
by these things I already knew.

288
0:18:9,714 --> 0:18:10,672
<i>What to do?</i>

289
0:18:10,840 --> 0:18:12,820
<i>I hung up Leela
with the other bone-bags</i>

290
0:18:12,945 --> 0:18:16,430
<i>and went to procure the final ingredient
for my stem cell brew.</i>

291
0:18:21,586 --> 0:18:23,883
Professor, my fry fro is all frizzy.

292
0:18:24,186 --> 0:18:25,195
My God,

293
0:18:25,320 --> 0:18:28,605
I can't believe I'll never see
that particular Fry again.

294
0:18:33,2 --> 0:18:34,195
Where's my shoes?

295
0:18:36,574 --> 0:18:39,119
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize I was already here.

296
0:18:39,400 --> 0:18:40,118
Wait.

297
0:18:40,286 --> 0:18:41,657
What's with all the Leelas?

298
0:18:41,782 --> 0:18:43,79
Trust me, don't ask.

299
0:18:43,247 --> 0:18:44,165
Okay, dork.

300
0:18:44,290 --> 0:18:47,0
I'm gonna hit the urinal,
maybe talk about myself a little bit...

301
0:18:47,168 --> 0:18:49,836
Hang on.
It's time to sort things out.

302
0:18:50,4 --> 0:18:51,5
The truth is,

303
0:18:51,251 --> 0:18:52,458
I love fry.

304
0:18:52,904 --> 0:18:55,341
- That fry.
- And I love Leela.

305
0:18:55,634 --> 0:18:56,642
Any Leela.

306
0:18:56,767 --> 0:18:58,511
We're robots, and we're in love.

307
0:18:58,776 --> 0:19:0,522
Let's ditch these meat jackets.

308
0:19:6,346 --> 0:19:8,350
Hasta la vista, Wiener.

309
0:19:9,463 --> 0:19:11,725
We'll be back.
For our stuff.

310
0:19:15,223 --> 0:19:16,851
Why did their voices change?

311
0:19:16,976 --> 0:19:20,695
That's the one thing
we'll never truly understand.

312
0:19:22,230 --> 0:19:23,917
This is a bit awkward.

313
0:19:24,363 --> 0:19:25,163
Or is it?

314
0:19:25,331 --> 0:19:26,451
I'm not sure...

315
0:19:26,576 --> 0:19:28,727
I lost track
around the second robot.

316
0:19:29,667 --> 0:19:32,854
You know how I feel.
I waited for you for a thousand years.

317
0:19:33,159 --> 0:19:34,741
I can wait a little longer.

318
0:19:35,591 --> 0:19:37,741
What a load of mush!
I've had it!

319
0:19:41,691 --> 0:19:42,957
He's gonna blow!

320
0:19:43,82 --> 0:19:45,758
Party, Bender!
Party for your life!

321
0:19:46,143 --> 0:19:47,750
No chance, high pants.

322
0:19:48,20 --> 0:19:50,298
I'd rather die
and kill all of you than party

323
0:19:50,423 --> 0:19:52,442
for one more millisecond!

324
0:19:55,361 --> 0:19:56,778
The cyclops eater!

325
0:20:11,669 --> 0:20:14,212
Hold on, mack!
It ain't like that!

326
0:20:26,137 --> 0:20:28,351
Geez, what does it take to kill me?

327
0:20:31,832 --> 0:20:35,17
Bender, you blew out
your excess capacity.

328
0:20:35,321 --> 0:20:36,681
You're cured!

329
0:20:38,192 --> 0:20:39,399
Sweet mercy!

330
0:20:39,524 --> 0:20:41,356
My hellish nightmare is over!

331
0:20:41,481 --> 0:20:43,449
I never have to party again!

332
0:20:43,617 --> 0:20:45,34
Well, that's that, then.

333
0:20:45,202 --> 0:20:46,739
We're back, everyone!

334
0:20:46,864 --> 0:20:48,881
Par-tay!
