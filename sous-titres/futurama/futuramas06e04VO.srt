<i>We now go live
to our eye-in-the-sky hovercopter</i>

4
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:25,965
on the scene of that terrible
hovercopter crash.

5
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:28,586
The news is not good.

6
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:31,989
I've just learned that my final words
were "Back to you, Linda".

7
00:00:35,082 --> 00:00:36,535
One for the blooper reel.

8
00:00:37,391 --> 00:00:39,041
The news is so violent.

9
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:41,255
Let's watch Rachael Ray instead.

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,167
No, wait, there might be chopping.

11
00:00:43,624 --> 00:00:45,186
God, what a wuss.

12
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:47,713
Stop being
such a spineless jellyfish.

13
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,428
You know full well
I am more related to the sea cucumber.

14
00:00:51,622 --> 00:00:53,122
Not where it counts.

15
00:00:54,734 --> 00:00:56,013
I hated Jim!

16
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,174
In other news,

17
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:00,724
our city's filthy, urine-soaked walls
have been desecrated

18
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:03,499
by a mysterious tile-work
graffiti artist.

19
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:04,947
Police have no leads

20
00:01:05,072 --> 00:01:07,916
as to who's behind
this innovative scourge of public art.

21
00:01:19,309 --> 00:01:21,704
That is one sexy bridge abutment.

22
00:01:40,915 --> 00:01:41,915
Free corn?

23
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,327
Well, that'll suit me just fine.

24
00:01:56,874 --> 00:01:59,674
The key is knowing
precisely where to strike.

25
00:02:02,691 --> 00:02:04,591
Time to beat him his rights.

26
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,423
You know, that don't look
half bad on your buttocks.

27
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,674
It does sort of class up the place.

<i>The time is 4:00 a.m.!</i>

29
00:02:20,295 --> 00:02:22,592
We've been arguing all night, Kif.

30
00:02:22,717 --> 00:02:24,059
Can't we go to bed?

31
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,024
Is that all you ever think about?

32
00:02:26,149 --> 00:02:28,269
I'm not just some
piece of tofu, Amy.

33
00:02:28,394 --> 00:02:30,608
I need to know
where we stand in our relationship.

34
00:02:30,828 --> 00:02:33,319
We're just going
through a rough patch.

35
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,992
It is not a patch.
It's been ages,

36
00:02:36,117 --> 00:02:39,253
according to your wildly inappropriate
hunk-of-the-month calendar.

37
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:40,999
Leave Todd out of this.

38
00:02:41,124 --> 00:02:42,203
Thanks, babe.

39
00:02:42,373 --> 00:02:45,351
Also, today is
Canadian Independence Day.

40
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:54,415
That's Bender's ringtone.
I recognize the smell.

41
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,052
<i>Yo, Amy, I'm in the slammer.</i>

42
00:02:58,985 --> 00:03:01,388
<i>That's enough lip out of you,
moneybags.</i>

43
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,307
<i>Just get five grand and bail me out.</i>

44
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,162
I don't have that kind of money.

45
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:06,310
<i>Yeah, you do.</i>

46
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,664
<i>You know that floor safe
where you keep ten grand?</i>

47
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,224
<i>There's five grand in there.</i>

48
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:12,441
<i>Don't make me wait.</i>

49
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:22,217
You ever kill a man with a sock?
It ain't so hard.

50
00:03:25,763 --> 00:03:28,263
I'd better carve a shiv
for protection.

51
00:03:32,418 --> 00:03:33,418
Rodriguez.

52
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:35,965
These two brothers
bailed your ass out.

53
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:37,599
Oh, thank God.

54
00:03:37,724 --> 00:03:40,427
Tell me, have things changed
on the outside?

55
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,259
Is food finally in pill form?

56
00:03:42,384 --> 00:03:44,682
What about pills?
Are they in food form?

57
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,142
Hot stuff,
I'm Larry, the murder burglar.

58
00:03:48,267 --> 00:03:50,326
Hi, Larry, I like your tattoos.

59
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:52,635
Amy, that man is a criminal.

60
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,810
I'm just checking out his tats.

61
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,155
Sneato.

62
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,621
I have one of my mom.

63
00:04:01,746 --> 00:04:03,396
- Want to see?
- Sure.

64
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,598
I just don't get why you have
to flirt with every bad boy in sight.

65
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,123
Quit exaggerating.

66
00:04:18,803 --> 00:04:21,093
Nobody move
or sweet cheeks here gets it.

67
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,722
You're bad.

68
00:04:27,982 --> 00:04:29,752
Mama said Spock you out.

69
00:04:29,877 --> 00:04:30,936
That's it, Amy.

70
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,690
Pardon my language, but I have had it
with you ruffling my petticoats.

71
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,479
You and I are through.

72
00:04:42,993 --> 00:04:45,222
Here's a little song
I wrote to cheer you up.

73
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:48,866
It's called "Let's Go Already."

74
00:05:01,864 --> 00:05:03,043
Here's to Amy,

75
00:05:03,168 --> 00:05:05,888
single, lonely, and fabulous.

76
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,500
Thanks, everybody.

77
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,311
Looks like I'm back in the game.

78
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,245
Yeah, the game of old maid.

79
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,484
- Excuse me, sir, are those yours?
- You're damn right,

80
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,097
and before you ask,
this is mine, too.

81
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,866
Tough break, Amy.
Are you and Kif getting divorced?

82
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,943
No, technically we were Fon-Fon-Rus,
so we weren't really married.

83
00:05:30,842 --> 00:05:33,040
The interesting thing
about that is...

84
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:39,088
So, Amy, how can I phrase
this delicately?

85
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,882
Why did Kif dump you
like a sack of yesterday's turds?

86
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,337
He says I have a thing for bad boys.

87
00:05:44,462 --> 00:05:45,728
It's so stupid.

88
00:05:45,853 --> 00:05:47,484
The truth is often stupid.

89
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,278
Bender, why do you have
to be so mean to me?

90
00:05:52,403 --> 00:05:53,727
Shut up, baby, you love it.

91
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,235
Don't tell me to shut up.

92
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,101
You know what happened
to the last guy who told me to shut up?

93
00:05:58,226 --> 00:05:59,226
What?

94
00:06:01,087 --> 00:06:02,392
That was great.

95
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,890
Shut up.

96
00:06:04,747 --> 00:06:06,115
Yeah, come over here.

97
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:13,249
Remember, love between a human
and a robot is taboo.

98
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:16,291
We can't tell anyone,
not even our coworkers.

99
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,868
Got it.
I'll show the utmost discretion

100
00:06:19,115 --> 00:06:21,997
as we get nasty in this glass tube.

101
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,097
I think I'm coming down
with circus-itis.

102
00:06:32,716 --> 00:06:35,102
I thought circus-itis
only affected children.

103
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,812
Children of all ages.

104
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:40,251
Bender, old friend,
what's on your face?

105
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:42,332
Blood.

106
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:45,578
You know...
shaving of the face beard.

107
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:49,106
Amy, are those gear imprints
on your sweatpants?

108
00:06:49,502 --> 00:06:51,251
Maybe. So what?

109
00:06:51,376 --> 00:06:53,662
I only brought it up
'cause Bender's wearing them.

110
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:57,916
I stole 'em from her.
Yeah, that's it, call the cops.

111
00:06:58,613 --> 00:07:00,113
My swollen feet.

112
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:03,241
I'd better take my pills.

113
00:07:05,284 --> 00:07:08,802
Amy, I reckon sweet talk
don't come natural to me,

114
00:07:09,098 --> 00:07:11,031
but of everyone I've ever dated,

115
00:07:11,156 --> 00:07:13,306
you are probably in the top ten.

116
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:18,473
You always say just the wrong thing
in just the right way.

117
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,315
Sinners!

118
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:24,568
Robosexuality is an abomination!

119
00:07:25,008 --> 00:07:26,880
- This guy.
- The good book say

120
00:07:27,005 --> 00:07:29,999
a robot shall not lie down
with a human,

121
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:31,700
nor do it standing up,

122
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,827
nor at any angle in between.

123
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,106
Look, a single mother!
Let's get her!

124
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,199
Quickly, into the ship's basement!

125
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,053
Now then, as you all know,

126
00:08:01,178 --> 00:08:03,649
the county fair
is approaching once again,

127
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,361
so I'm preparing my entry
of pickled winds and weathers.

128
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,571
I've got sunny, snow flurries,

129
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:10,935
hail with onions,

130
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,866
even my grandmother's
cranberry-raisin typhoon,

131
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:16,239
but no tornado.

132
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:20,210
I'll be damned if I let Mrs. Girdleson
take the blue ribbon again.

133
00:08:23,163 --> 00:08:24,294
That's why I need you

134
00:08:24,727 --> 00:08:27,527
to get out there
and harvest a nice ripe one.

135
00:08:27,658 --> 00:08:29,658
This cattle prod should help.

136
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,219
- How will that...?
- Get out there!

137
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:36,723
Is everybody in position?!

138
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,724
What?!

139
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,393
Is someone talking?!

140
00:08:39,577 --> 00:08:41,942
Okay, good! On three!

141
00:08:42,211 --> 00:08:43,063
One!

142
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,481
What did she say?!

143
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,125
- Two!
- Wait, I'm not in position!

144
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,821
- Three!
- I'm ready for the countdown!

145
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,657
I'm not hearing anyone!
Abort mission!

146
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,325
She said go!

147
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,254
Good work, everyone.

148
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:10,070
Honestly, that went
better than I expected.

149
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:13,700
I just need to reduce it
down into this pickle jar,

150
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:17,547
toss in a bay leaf
to impress those stupid judges...

151
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,601
Where's Amy and Bender?

152
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,561
They're missing out
on some hot pickle action.

153
00:09:28,978 --> 00:09:30,694
Sounds like a muskrat's
caught in there.

154
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,128
That's Amy's sweatshirt.

155
00:09:33,253 --> 00:09:35,532
And that's Bender's hat
from the Playah's Ball!

156
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,553
Sweet tornado of Barbado.

157
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:39,745
Amy and Bender
have been torn to shreds.

158
00:09:43,477 --> 00:09:44,827
The humanity.

159
00:09:45,075 --> 00:09:46,210
Also Bender.

160
00:09:56,891 --> 00:09:58,828
What's going on here?!

161
00:10:00,884 --> 00:10:02,059
Nothing.

162
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:04,976
A pair of deviant robosexuals?!

163
00:10:05,134 --> 00:10:06,652
Not under my roof.

164
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:08,148
What about on the roof?

165
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,610
- Get your mind out of the gutter.
- What about in the gutter?

166
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,030
Professor, there's nothing wrong
with robosexuality.

167
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,952
Yeah, when the lights go out,
it's nobody's business

168
00:10:18,077 --> 00:10:20,415
what goes on
between two consenting adults.

169
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,495
Or one.

170
00:10:21,665 --> 00:10:22,757
Thanks, guys.

171
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,990
Everything will be okay as long
as my parents don't find out.

172
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:27,315
<i>Zai jian.</i>

173
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,925
Mom? Dad?

174
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,350
Come home, Amy. It your decision.

175
00:10:38,642 --> 00:10:39,820
We can't make you.

176
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,285
Attagirl.

177
00:10:49,362 --> 00:10:50,983
Not the innocent whistling.

178
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,940
Repent!

179
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,221
Oh, this guy.

180
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:03,203
Look, we're your family,

181
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:06,707
and if you can't talk about your problem
with us, that would be great.

182
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,345
I don't have a problem!

183
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,792
I'm in a happy relationship
that just happens to be robosex...

184
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:14,047
You finish that word,
you kill your parents!

185
00:11:15,813 --> 00:11:17,586
<i>Low wine level detected.</i>

186
00:11:19,124 --> 00:11:21,722
- Thank you.
- Stop seducing him, you hussy!

187
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,390
Dad, gleesh!

188
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:25,247
I'm attracted to Bender,

189
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:27,936
not this emotionless wine bucket!

190
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:31,404
Hopes...

191
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:32,524
deleted.

192
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:34,536
Robotic brothers,

193
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:37,414
the path to robot hell

194
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:40,532
- is paved with human flesh!
- Neat!

195
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,241
Over the course
of this escape-proof workshop

196
00:11:43,526 --> 00:11:46,726
your software will be reprogrammed
through prayer.

197
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:49,958
And by some tech-support guys
in India.

198
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,012
But I read in <i>Esquire</i> magazine

199
00:11:52,137 --> 00:11:55,167
that some robots are hard-wired
to be robosexual.

200
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,902
Don't believe those lies, son!

201
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,125
The only lies worth believing

202
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,763
are the ones in the Bible.
Can I get an amen?

203
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,227
I'll take-a three men. Holla!

204
00:12:08,442 --> 00:12:09,603
Come on, Amy.

205
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:11,313
Pick a male human already.

206
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,366
I want to be a grandmother...
nine months from five minutes from now.

207
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:15,817
Cut it out, mom!

208
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:19,529
I'm not interested in any
of these gross, ugly losers!

209
00:12:19,944 --> 00:12:22,699
What about this gross,
ugly, smelly loser?

210
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,660
- Fry! What you doing here?
- I'm here to rescue Amy...

211
00:12:26,308 --> 00:12:28,135
from her robosexual desire.

212
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,924
If I understand you correctly,

213
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:33,066
I've seen the error of my ways?

214
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,297
- Look at all that awkward winking?
- It must be love!

215
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,637
My parents may be evil,
but at least they're stupid.

216
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:46,356
In this phase,

217
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:49,393
you will literally wrestle
with your demons.

218
00:12:49,664 --> 00:12:52,312
Your shapely, buxom, human demons.

219
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,315
Look at the rack on that one!

220
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,818
I mean... That one on the rack!

221
00:13:02,183 --> 00:13:02,906
Good!

222
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:04,810
That's very good.

223
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:09,287
Everybody switch demons.
No point in staying with just one demon.

224
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:15,892
Now, work it hard!

225
00:13:16,368 --> 00:13:17,330
Harder!

226
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:19,838
Till the sin explodes outcha!

227
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:23,055
Mercy.

228
00:13:24,478 --> 00:13:26,965
The Lord's work is done.
Now, now, cuddle,

229
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,772
cuddle with your demons.

230
00:13:32,659 --> 00:13:34,789
I wonder where you are right now.

231
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,562
I'm inside the dummy to rescue you!

232
00:13:37,687 --> 00:13:39,103
That answers that.

233
00:13:39,228 --> 00:13:40,690
Wait, what? Amy?

234
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:46,463
Bender, be careful!

235
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,295
Fry? Leela? You're in there, too?

236
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:52,956
I guess we should have waited
in the ship.

237
00:13:55,894 --> 00:13:57,029
Aw, phooey!

238
00:13:57,332 --> 00:13:58,753
Listen up, everybody,

239
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,197
I love Amy, and I'm tired
of pussyfootcupping around.

240
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:05,875
I finally found someone I want
to spend the rest of her life with.

241
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,518
Will you marry me?

242
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:21,526
I'm just glad I didn't live
to see this day.

243
00:14:22,343 --> 00:14:23,499
Wait a second.

244
00:14:33,297 --> 00:14:34,664
So, it's a stone.

245
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,075
Is it real?

246
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,079
Hooray!

247
00:14:41,295 --> 00:14:42,422
Hooray denied!

248
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,870
Need I remind you

249
00:14:43,995 --> 00:14:46,885
that robosexual marriage is illegal?

250
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:50,786
- Not in Space Massachusetts.
- You mean Space-Tax-Achusetts?

251
00:14:51,186 --> 00:14:52,818
No chance, stretch pants!

252
00:14:52,943 --> 00:14:55,560
We're gonna fight to legalize it
right here!

253
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,271
Yah, mon! You got to legalize it!

254
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,857
We're talking about
robosexual marriage.

255
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,400
We're talking of lots stuff.

256
00:15:15,053 --> 00:15:17,249
Cool. Can you turn into a race car?

257
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:19,751
Nah, I'm just a pre-op transformer.

258
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,419
Thanks for coming, everyone.

259
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,922
We're all having some good,
clean fun here.

260
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,882
Squeaky, squishy clean.

261
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,264
But it's time to discuss
a pressing issue...

262
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:34,159
the right to marry who
or what we want!

263
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,457
Every other couple
has the right to marry.

264
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,106
Robot and fembot,

265
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,399
man and woman,

266
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,153
man and man.

267
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,358
Our poodle has two daddies!

268
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:47,872
Interracial,

269
00:15:47,997 --> 00:15:49,614
interplanetary,

270
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,625
even ghost and horse,

271
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,827
but not robot and human!

272
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:01,876
That's why we're introducing
this ballot initiative to legalize

273
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,628
robosexual marriage!

274
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:10,150
If you hate intolerance
and being punched in the face by me,

275
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:13,750
please support Proposition Infinity!

276
00:16:30,384 --> 00:16:31,865
As election day nears,

277
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,741
Prop Infinity appears doomed
to certain defeat.

278
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:36,402
Doomed!

279
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,857
More fair and balanced coverage
after a word from our sponsor,

280
00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:42,334
no on Infinity.

281
00:16:44,657 --> 00:16:46,063
<i>A storm is gathering.</i>

282
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:48,354
<i>A storm of robosexual marriage</i>

283
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:50,408
<i>that will rain down on us like fire.</i>

284
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:52,297
<i>It's probably a firestorm.</i>

285
00:16:52,422 --> 00:16:54,740
<i>If robosexual marriage
becomes legal,</i>

286
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,138
<i>imagine the horrible things
that will happen to our children,</i>

287
00:16:58,263 --> 00:17:01,600
<i>then imagine we said those things,
since we couldn't think of any.</i>

288
00:17:01,725 --> 00:17:04,212
<i>As a mother, those things worry me.</i>

289
00:17:04,601 --> 00:17:07,525
<i>Vote no on Infinity.
Paid for by the Farnsworth Foundation.</i>

290
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:11,196
We can't compete against
that much stock footage of clouds!

291
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,448
We're boned!

292
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,934
But we still have one hope...

293
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:18,536
my big televised debate!
I'm our A in the hole!

294
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,664
Professor,
who's debating for your side?

295
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:21,886
That guy...

296
00:17:22,437 --> 00:17:24,664
You know, I forget his name.

297
00:17:25,738 --> 00:17:26,894
That's him!

298
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,954
Good evening.
I'm George Takei's head and neck,

299
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,146
your host for tonight's debate.
You may applaud.

300
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,994
We flipped a coin before the debate,
and Bender stole it,

301
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:40,850
so we'll start with him.

302
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,176
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

303
00:17:44,322 --> 00:17:45,922
Sorry, force of habit.

304
00:17:47,186 --> 00:17:48,886
I support this proposition

305
00:17:49,011 --> 00:17:52,627
because I love a goopy,
flesh-and-blood woman,

306
00:17:53,135 --> 00:17:55,365
and, not surprisingly, she loves me.

307
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,043
This is a simple matter of justice,

308
00:17:59,616 --> 00:18:01,302
which I'm not normally for.

309
00:18:01,562 --> 00:18:03,281
So please, vote yes.

310
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:07,194
After all, our love
isn't any different from yours...

311
00:18:07,423 --> 00:18:09,421
except it's hotter,
'cause I'm involved.

312
00:18:12,316 --> 00:18:15,091
I haven't heard such
an eloquent speech

313
00:18:15,216 --> 00:18:18,294
since Bill Shatner explained
why he couldn't pay me back.

314
00:18:18,521 --> 00:18:20,223
Rebuttal, Professor?

315
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:23,601
This four-dollar coffeepot
talks about love,

316
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,104
but what he describes is perversion!

317
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,599
You wouldn't know perversion
if it put clamps on your testicles!

318
00:18:29,724 --> 00:18:32,652
You're just jealous,
'cause you've never known true love.

319
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,150
Oh, no? Back when
I was full of piss and vinegar,

320
00:18:36,275 --> 00:18:38,693
and my bed wasn't, I feel in love

321
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:40,425
with the sweetest girl ever

322
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,236
to skip through a field of posie.

323
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,248
<i>Her name was Eunice,</i>

324
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,479
<i>and we spent out blissful days
working in a lab,</i>

325
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:49,819
<i>developing a poison</i>

326
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:52,943
<i>to wipe out
that dreadful posie infestation.</i>

327
00:18:55,565 --> 00:18:57,677
<i>I thought our love
would last forever.</i>

328
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,096
<i>But then, 43 years later,</i>

329
00:19:00,602 --> 00:19:01,748
<i>she left me...</i>

330
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:03,964
<i>for a robot!</i>

331
00:19:08,692 --> 00:19:10,811
How could she do that to me,

332
00:19:10,936 --> 00:19:12,722
her Farnypoo!

333
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:14,316
That's it?

334
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:18,604
You hate robosexuals 'cause
your girlfriend left you for a robot?

335
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,328
She didn't just leave me
for a robot,

336
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,203
she was a robot!

337
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:29,976
Her name wasn't Eunice,

338
00:19:30,101 --> 00:19:31,219
it was Unit!

339
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:33,338
Unit 47!

340
00:19:37,817 --> 00:19:39,299
<i>My heart was broken,</i>

341
00:19:39,536 --> 00:19:41,677
and like a bitter old picklepuss,

342
00:19:41,802 --> 00:19:44,758
I took it out
on robosexuals everywhere.

343
00:19:44,974 --> 00:19:46,973
I'm so ashamed!

344
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:50,990
At the risk of losing this debate,

345
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,901
I beg you,
support Proposition Infinity!

346
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,216
Give me a hug!

347
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:01,643
I, too, am hugging them in spirit.

348
00:20:01,924 --> 00:20:04,335
And now they're hugging me back.

349
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,709
In a stunning turnabout,

350
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,419
<i>voters have approved
Proposition Infinity.</i>

351
00:20:14,544 --> 00:20:16,777
<i>Robosexual marriage is now legal.</i>

352
00:20:16,902 --> 00:20:17,902
<i>What's next,</i>

353
00:20:18,027 --> 00:20:19,988
<i>gay robosexual marriage?</i>

354
00:20:22,245 --> 00:20:23,585
We did it, honey!

355
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,515
Finally, we can have a legal,
monogamous marriage,

356
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,769
like everyone else!

357
00:20:29,618 --> 00:20:30,562
Monogamous?

358
00:20:34,236 --> 00:20:36,961
<i>And now, a long-distance dedication</i>

359
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:40,907
<i>from a squishy green bad boy
to his pink pork dumpling...</i>

360
00:20:41,785 --> 00:20:42,866
<i>at number 12,</i>

361
00:20:43,255 --> 00:20:45,449
<i>It's Wailing Fungus with...</i>

362
00:20:45,671 --> 00:20:47,203
<i>"Shut up and love me."</i>
