00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:16,515
Bite My Shiny Metal Ass Team

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,804
As mayor,

4
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:22,980
it is my deeply tedious pleasure
to kick off

5
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,408
the 83rd or 84th

6
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:28,368
Annual E-Waste Recycling Festival!

7
00:00:30,974 --> 00:00:32,150
Down in front!

8
00:00:32,553 --> 00:00:35,083
Sorry. I get aroused in crowds.

9
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:37,078
I will now throw out

10
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,443
the ceremonial first dump,

11
00:00:40,146 --> 00:00:42,849
this old, inefficient vote rigger!

12
00:00:46,272 --> 00:00:50,218
These old doomsday devices
are dangerously unstable.

13
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:53,127
I'll rest easier not knowing
where they are.

14
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:58,224
So long,
overly complicated Japanese toilet.

15
00:00:58,502 --> 00:01:00,059
Please not to throw away.

16
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,951
I give you a happy poopie time.

17
00:01:02,076 --> 00:01:03,853
Sorry, you know too much.

18
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,994
Seems like a good place
to ditch some evidence.

19
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:13,531
Flexo?

20
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,866
What are you doing
in a hazardous waste bin?

21
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:19,198
Haven't you heard? Us bending units
are dangerously outdated.

22
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,498
We overheat, we're radioactive,
we cause erectile dysfunc...

23
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,317
Who are you talking to?

24
00:01:25,442 --> 00:01:27,814
No one. Your mama. Shut up.

25
00:01:28,365 --> 00:01:29,505
Take your pick.

26
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:35,386
Scoop Chang, New New York Times
online podcast blog comments editor.

27
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,555
Mr. Mayor,
isn't this e-waste dangerous?

28
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:38,974
Not at all, Scoop.

29
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,116
Not after it's hauled
off to the Third World

30
00:01:41,241 --> 00:01:43,689
by an expendable team
of minimum-wage nobodies.

31
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:46,962
Good news, nobodies!

32
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,044
Greetings, my friends!

33
00:02:09,731 --> 00:02:12,380
It shan't take long
to strip down your clunker.

34
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:15,009
Nothing wrong with our clunker.

35
00:02:15,277 --> 00:02:18,700
Really? Because we can smelt out
the deadly, deadly chromium

36
00:02:18,825 --> 00:02:21,515
to make rat poison
and artificial sweeteners.

37
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:23,928
No, thanks.
We're delivering e-waste.

38
00:02:24,053 --> 00:02:25,561
Pity. We're halfway done.

39
00:02:28,313 --> 00:02:30,756
This thing is 40% chromium!

40
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,180
Gentle now.
Gentle with the hoverdumpster.

41
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,196
Ready for processing!

42
00:02:45,737 --> 00:02:47,672
What smells like bloody sinuses?

43
00:02:47,797 --> 00:02:50,628
We burn your e-waste down
to the usable metals,

44
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,474
safely releasing the toxins

45
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,745
into our air and drinking water.

46
00:02:58,066 --> 00:03:01,472
- That's the worst thing I've ever seen!
- Really? Then don't look over there.

47
00:03:03,212 --> 00:03:04,099
Okay, kids.

48
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:06,352
Let's play find the shiny!

49
00:03:12,203 --> 00:03:13,803
That's even more horrific!

50
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:15,890
Is all the work done by children?

51
00:03:16,744 --> 00:03:17,987
Not the whipping.

52
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:25,764
Granted, we later learned
some positive things about recycling,

53
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:28,448
but a better solution
is to use our electronics

54
00:03:28,573 --> 00:03:30,960
as long as possible
instead of throwing them out

55
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,255
in the first place.

56
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,688
I'm gonna start by keeping
my old cell phone,

57
00:03:34,813 --> 00:03:36,090
even if it is outdated.

58
00:03:36,655 --> 00:03:37,942
<i>Hello, Miss Turanga.</i>

00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:40,010
<i>Your call to Saint Louis

60
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,902
Let's at least throw this TV out.

61
00:03:43,443 --> 00:03:45,432
The batteries in the remote
are getting low.

62
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,018
No! Put that back and turn it on!

63
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:49,724
I was just trying to help.

64
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:55,192
<i>More on this breaking puff-piece

65

<i>From Mom.</i>

70
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,334
A new eyePhone?
Forget this junk.

71
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:15,856
- This is a fine how-do-you-do!
- So long!

72
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:17,781
- <i>Sayonara!</i>
- Good riddance!

73
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,843
Come on,
let's buy some eyePhones online.

74
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:26,633
Wait. I thought we were buying
our eyePhones online.

75
00:04:26,758 --> 00:04:28,017
We are on line.

76
00:04:28,763 --> 00:04:30,871
But I thought the Mom Store
was across town.

77
00:04:30,996 --> 00:04:32,611
It is across town.

78
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:35,107
- But I thought...
- Stop thinking, Fry!

79
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:45,242
I feel like a mindless zombie. I wish
I knew how long we've been waiting.

80
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,328
The eyePhone has an app for that!

81
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,830
Is there an app
for kissing my shiny metal ass?

82
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:50,748
Several!

83
00:04:56,726 --> 00:04:59,506
The light!
I guess I'm off to hell.

84
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,293
That's the store, Professor.

85
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:16,106
It's that obscure underground song
that's constantly playing everywhere.

86

89
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:30,854
- Are there any left?
- There may be one.

90
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:37,743
Okay, it's $500,
you have no choice of carrier,

91
00:05:37,868 --> 00:05:40,547
the battery can't hold a charge,
and the reception isn't very...

92
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,049

ethnicities that knows about technology.

98
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:58,674
- Why is it called an eyePhone?
- I'll explain after I install it.

99
00:06:04,691 --> 00:06:05,406
Neat.

100
00:06:07,113 --> 00:06:08,669

Check out this webisode

00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:31,200
It's a phone call, dingus.

124
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,453
These eyePhones are phones, too?

125
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:36,914
- Fry-lo.

00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:45,243
<i>Totally.

00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,951
The eyePhone records everything.

134
00:08:03,076 --> 00:08:06,736
All I did was add a laugh track
and twit it to my 10,000 followers.

Too much information.

142
00:08:28,184 --> 00:08:30,176
It's exactly the right amount
of information!

143
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,784
For years, I've collected personal data
with old-fashioned methods,

144
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,338
like spybots and info-squitos.

145

00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,612
Since when is the Internet
about robbing people of their privacy?

176
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,802
August 6, 1991.

177
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,770
I'll bet I can get as many followers
as you without sinking to your level.

178
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,080
What do you say? First one
to a million followers wins a buck.

179
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:23,462
You're on!

180
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:25,819
Send.

181
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,900
- What happens to the loser?
- Let's make it interesting.

182
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,471
Why is Mr. Chunks doing that?

183
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:40,624
Because the loser of our bet
has to do a double somersault

184
00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:43,167
into a tub of alien goat vomit.

185
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,062
Let's make it interestinger.

186
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,060
Vomit and diarrhea.

187
00:10:49,174 --> 00:10:51,818
Good idea.
That way we don't waste an end.

188
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:54,904
It's putrid.
What do you feed him?

189
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,308
What comes out one end,
we feed to the other.

190
00:10:57,433 --> 00:10:58,716
Also Indian food.

191
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,050
Let the contest begin!

192
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:30,815
Amazing.

193
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:34,094
Some dumb bastard has nearly
a million other dumb bastards

194
00:11:34,219 --> 00:11:35,653
following his every twit!

195
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,910
Are you dumb bastards
listening to me,

196
00:11:38,035 --> 00:11:39,199
you dumb bastards?

197
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,201
Why are you so angry, mommy?

198
00:11:42,006 --> 00:11:43,236
I'm sorry.

199
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,498
I guess I'm just a little nervous
about my evil plan.

200
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,124
You dumb bastards!

201
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:53,004
You see, the plan is about
to enter phase two.

202
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,507
As soon as someone
reaches a million followers,

203
00:11:55,776 --> 00:11:57,675
I'll use them to transmit...

204
00:11:57,955 --> 00:11:59,706
The twit-worm.

205
00:12:03,815 --> 00:12:05,804
Mother, you devious hag.

206
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:08,353
Tell us more about this "twit-worm."

207
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,964
It's a very special computer virus,

208
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:13,099
for instead of infecting computers,

209
00:12:13,224 --> 00:12:16,037
it infects the human brain.

210
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:18,071
I like it.

211
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,236
The million followers
will become an army of zombies,

212
00:12:21,361 --> 00:12:23,760
eager to obey my every command.

213
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,674
The important thing is,
we're a family.

214
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:28,873
It's not!

215
00:12:36,912 --> 00:12:38,389
He sneezed in it.

216
00:12:38,514 --> 00:12:40,535
God, I'm going to lose the bet.

217
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,585
I'm gonna have to swim in the juice
of the puke-me-poop-you.

218
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,724
Don't give up.
You just need more titillating twits.

219
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:48,601
Trust me, I want twits that tittle.

220
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,937
Then you're gonna have
to sink to Bender's level.

221
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,311
Stop acting like the
Queen of England.

222
00:12:55,761 --> 00:12:57,678
Who was that...
the Queen of England?

223
00:12:58,414 --> 00:12:59,695
Excuse me.

224
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,780
I have to... someplace.

225
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:04,937
That was odd.
Where'd that singing come from?

226
00:13:05,062 --> 00:13:08,481
It wasn't the goat.
All of its orifices are in use.

227
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,080
- What the hell is that?
- Nothing.

228
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:36,399
I'm not nothing.

229
00:13:36,706 --> 00:13:39,277
All my life everyone's
called me nothing.

230
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:42,439
You have a boil on your butt
that sings show tunes with you?

231
00:13:42,564 --> 00:13:44,657
Don't look at me. I'm a freak.

232
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,409
No, no... well...

233
00:13:47,453 --> 00:13:50,402
I've been ashamed of Susan
as long as I can remember.

234
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:52,415
You named your boil Susan?

235
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:54,034
A boil kinna have a name?

236
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:56,764
They also said a boil
kinna sing, but...

237
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,431
She's Scottish.

238
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,441
I lance her every few months,

239
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:12,460
but she always grows back.

240
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:15,773
It's hard enough being a cyclops,

241
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,937
but if anyone found out about Susan,

242
00:14:18,062 --> 00:14:19,645
I'd be devastated.

243
00:14:26,781 --> 00:14:29,574
Gross. Million-follower gross.

244
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:30,701
Delete that.

245
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:32,756
- Delete that right now!
- What?

246
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,924
So much for a pleasant swim
in vomit.

247
00:14:49,394 --> 00:14:50,394
Send.

248
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,490
Did you delete it?

249
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:56,900
You're a good friend.

250
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:10,892
There she goes in the genuine.

251
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:12,622
Let's get to hooting.

252
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:19,127
If it ain'ts the world's number ones
Internet sensation!

253
00:15:19,621 --> 00:15:20,539
Where?

254
00:15:20,664 --> 00:15:22,095
Also... what?

255
00:15:31,953 --> 00:15:33,600
Play it one more time.

256
00:15:34,484 --> 00:15:37,209
It's humiliating
and degrading to Leela.

257
00:15:37,334 --> 00:15:38,855
Play it ten more times.

258
00:15:39,964 --> 00:15:41,523
I shouldn't have twitted that,

259
00:15:41,648 --> 00:15:44,235
but not swimming in barf
might ease my conscience.

260
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:48,323
But if Leela should find out,
her dignity sac will rupture.

261
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:50,205
We can't let her see this.

262
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,619
Leela, lock the door
so Leela doesn't...

263
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:54,729
How could you do this?

264
00:16:33,546 --> 00:16:34,890
Poor Mr. Chunks.

265
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:37,232
At least he died doing
what he loved.

266
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,068
He's in a better place now.

267
00:16:43,793 --> 00:16:46,315
I turned a regular board
into a diving board.

268
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:50,198
Impending news, everyone.

269
00:16:50,323 --> 00:16:52,804
We're about to learn
the winner of the bet.

270
00:16:53,082 --> 00:16:54,806
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

271
00:16:55,218 --> 00:16:56,534
I hope it's me.

272
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,393
Wait a minute.

273
00:17:03,518 --> 00:17:06,776
There's a chance I could lose?
That wasn't part of the deal.

274
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,731
Sweet Georgia Brown
of Kingston Town.

275
00:17:11,856 --> 00:17:12,914
It's a tie.

276
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,827
Since no one lost,
no one has to jump.

277
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:18,288
All right, a tie! I win again!

278
00:17:19,499 --> 00:17:21,166
I'm a scuzzball.

279
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:24,461
Don't feel bad.
At least you're not Leela.

280
00:17:27,507 --> 00:17:28,441
A tie?

281
00:17:28,742 --> 00:17:30,925
This worked out better
than I could have hoped.

282
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:33,365
Now I'll have two million zombies.

283
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,211
Actually, Fry and Bender
may share the same followers.

284
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:39,378
All we can say for sure
is that there will be

285
00:17:39,503 --> 00:17:41,895
between one million
and two million zombies.

286
00:17:42,063 --> 00:17:44,226
All I can say for sure is...

287
00:17:44,705 --> 00:17:48,276
Now, stop getting slapped
and power up the twit-worm.

288
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,737
It's both disgusting and inspiring,

289
00:18:03,862 --> 00:18:05,877
like Jared from subway.

290
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:08,625
I'm a freak
with a singing butt boil,

291
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,007
but I'm still a human being,
more or less.

292
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:12,726
Singing butts boil?

293
00:18:12,851 --> 00:18:14,740
That's yesterdayses news.

294
00:18:14,865 --> 00:18:18,291
Like that giant caterpillar
what ate Jared from subway.

295
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:22,394
Nows us Internet geeks
gots a whole new video sensation.

296
00:18:22,562 --> 00:18:24,604
So my humiliation is over?

297
00:18:24,772 --> 00:18:26,028
Who are you?

298
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:33,980
And now,
to create an unstoppable army

299
00:18:34,105 --> 00:18:36,866
of between one
and two million zombies.

300
00:18:38,797 --> 00:18:41,204
Shouldn't you wait
for the weather to clear up?

301
00:18:42,248 --> 00:18:45,037
I give you the twit-worm.

302
00:18:47,928 --> 00:18:48,743
Send.

303
00:18:58,143 --> 00:19:00,293
I'm sick of my head doing things.

304
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:05,562
- I came to talk to you.
- No, I came to talk to you.

305
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:08,565
It looked like you
were just sitting there, but whatever.

306
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:11,605
I am so, so sorry for what I did,

307
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,403
and I can never make it up to you...

308
00:19:13,571 --> 00:19:15,181
You don't have to apologize.

309
00:19:15,306 --> 00:19:17,157
In fact, I came to thank you.

310
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:19,034
I think you mean hit me.

311
00:19:19,202 --> 00:19:22,162
Everyone knows my secret,
but noone cares.

312
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,205
I have nothing to hide anymore.

313
00:19:25,735 --> 00:19:27,642
Thanks to your selfish rudeness,

314
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,838
a terrible weight
has been lifted from my heart.

315
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:33,632
That's not the only place you
need a terrible weight lifted.

316
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,589
Susan and I are agreed.

317
00:19:36,714 --> 00:19:38,476
For the first time in our lives,

318
00:19:38,601 --> 00:19:41,018
we're not ashamed of who we are.

319
00:19:41,143 --> 00:19:43,302
I was never ashamed.

320
00:19:43,488 --> 00:19:44,488
Come here.

321
00:19:46,312 --> 00:19:47,228
What stinks?

322
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,105
Were you rolling around
in New Jersey?

323
00:19:49,826 --> 00:19:51,830
I knew I could never
make it up to you,

324
00:19:51,955 --> 00:19:53,590
so I did the next best thing...

325
00:19:53,715 --> 00:19:55,859
I put myself
through the same humiliation

326
00:19:55,984 --> 00:19:57,384
I put you through.

327
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,755
- You didn't have to do that.
- I didn't?

328
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,523
- Damn.
- Don't worry.

329
00:20:21,648 --> 00:20:23,682
By tomorrow, no one will remember.

330
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,449
Can I have another hug?

331
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:28,976
Hold your nose and give it a go.

332
00:20:46,915 --> 00:20:50,919
<i>Introducing the all new eyePhone 2.0</i>

333
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,520
Damn bastards.
