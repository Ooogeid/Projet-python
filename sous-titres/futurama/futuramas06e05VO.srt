3
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,562
Silence, puny audience!

4
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:25,519
And welcome to...

5
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:28,092
Who Dares To Be A Millionaire?

6
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:31,443
Tremble
before Morbo's mighty likeability,

7
00:00:31,568 --> 00:00:33,848
as I chit-chat
with our first contestant,

8
00:00:33,973 --> 00:00:35,326
Philip J. Fry.

9
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,335
Give him hell, Morbo!

10
00:00:45,819 --> 00:00:47,884
Prepare for pleasantries!

11
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:50,675
So, Fry, what do you do
for a living?

12
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:51,843
Me?

13
00:00:52,327 --> 00:00:54,637
- Can I phone a friend?
- Chit-chat achieved!

14
00:00:57,094 --> 00:00:59,141
Are you ready to play?

15
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,140
I didn't come to play.
I came to win.

16
00:01:02,577 --> 00:01:03,771
Now let's play.

17
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,182
For one dollar...

18
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:08,953
Is it...

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,693
B, nail, final answer!

20
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:20,287
Sweet dodo of Lesotho!

21
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,957
Don't you ever stop to think
before you speak?

22
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,750
I never stop to think about it.

23
00:01:25,506 --> 00:01:26,739
Leave Fry alone.

24
00:01:26,864 --> 00:01:29,496
His intelligence is just a little...
differenty.

25
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,215
You a big dummy!

26
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,719
I'm beginning to think
you guys don't think I'm very smart.

27
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:37,722
You can barely remember
your own name, Einstein.

28
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,724
Einstein is a hard name to remember.

29
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:42,818
Smeesh, Professor.

30
00:01:42,943 --> 00:01:45,938
Don't have a shmaneurysm.
Fry's your distant relative.

31
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,231
Not distant enough.

32
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,440
I'll be a monkey's uncle
if I'm this monkey's nephew.

33
00:01:51,784 --> 00:01:53,571
But you're my only family.

34
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:56,532
Who will hug me
if I achieve something?

35
00:01:57,506 --> 00:01:59,618
Perhaps I've been too harsh.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,345
Come, lad, take my hand
and I'll explain

37
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,257
why I find you so repugnant.

38
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:09,920
All my life,
I've been inspired by great minds...

39
00:02:10,495 --> 00:02:11,495
Euclid,

40
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,706
Copernicus, Braino...

41
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,987
And my personal role model,

42
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:18,008
Leonardo da Vinci.

43
00:02:18,376 --> 00:02:19,825
What turned them to stone?

44
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:23,896
Da Vinci was history's greatest artist
and inventor.

45
00:02:27,529 --> 00:02:28,481
<i>Voilà!</i>

46
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,414
He invented flying machines,

47
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:33,030
war engines, submarines...

48
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:36,674
- Nibbler died in the wall.
- That's not Nibbler.

49
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:40,326
That's my most precious possession.
Leonardo's beard!

50
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:44,402
I paid a fortune for it
at an auction of historic body parts.

51
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:48,036
I suppose
if I have an Achilles' heel,

52
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:50,961
it's because I bought it
at that same auction.

53
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:52,880
Indeed so.

54
00:02:53,496 --> 00:02:55,007
Most indeededly.

55
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,909
Careful with that, you fool!

56
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,474
But possibly yes.

57
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,392
What is it?

58
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:12,483
It's da Vinci's
fabled lost invention.

59
00:03:12,742 --> 00:03:15,325
Even the scholars
who wrote of this device

60
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,390
had no idea what it was for.

61
00:03:17,612 --> 00:03:20,515
And now, at last, neither do I!

62
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,736
- Maybe we can figure it out.
- We?

63
00:03:26,058 --> 00:03:28,241
Well, I may not have brain smarts,

64
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:30,334
but at least I have street smarts.

65
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:35,256
I was in the hospital two weeks.

66
00:03:35,628 --> 00:03:37,716
- No one visited me.
- Quiet, you!

67
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:41,910
I'm trying to deduce the function
of da Vinci's lost invention.

68
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:43,264
Not even a card.

69
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:46,338
He might have hidden a clue
in one of his other works.

70
00:03:46,463 --> 00:03:50,228
Ergo, I sent Bender out
for a copy of The Last Supper.

71
00:03:50,538 --> 00:03:51,355
I'm back!

72
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,276
Everybody at Kinko's was an idiot,
so I just brought the original.

73
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:04,065
Jesus Christ...

74
00:04:04,474 --> 00:04:05,981
and his 12 Apostles.

75
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,204
That's odd.

76
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:09,975
This hand here doesn't belong
to anybody.

77
00:04:10,297 --> 00:04:12,877
And it's pointing a knife
at James the Lesser.

78
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,022
That's the great thing
about that hand.

79
00:04:15,147 --> 00:04:17,401
And what about
these funky table legs?

80
00:04:17,526 --> 00:04:20,092
It's like they're from some other,
funkier painting.

81
00:04:20,352 --> 00:04:22,827
Maybe da Vinci painted
over something else.

82
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:24,597
It's called a pentimento.

83
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,414
That's true, Dr. Zoidberg.

84
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:28,475
How did you know that?

85
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,686
My doctorate is in art history.

86
00:04:31,014 --> 00:04:33,812
Let's see
what's under The Last Supper.

87
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,215
Wait a second! I'm not big-boned.

88
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,446
I'm just fat.

89
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,657
My God! Look!

90
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,952
My God! I'm looking!

91
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:51,165
My God! Saint James was a robot!

92
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:55,461
My God! Da Vinci left
his legs unpainted as a clue.

93
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,298
My God! This is
the greatest mystery of all time.

94
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:03,302
We must fly to Rome
and exhume the body of Saint James.

95
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,554
Didn't we used to be
a delivery company?

96
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,639
To the ship.

97
00:05:37,264 --> 00:05:39,653
Leela,
wanna join the mile-deep club?

98
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,106
Sure, why not?

99
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,659
No time!

100
00:05:42,784 --> 00:05:46,587
I've found a clue that could unlock
all the secrets of history.

101
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,308
- Look at these Roman numerals.
- Roman numerals?

102
00:05:51,802 --> 00:05:54,751
- I've got it! We're in Rome.
- Don't be stupid.

103
00:05:54,998 --> 00:05:57,528
It's a long-lost mathematical code.

104
00:05:57,764 --> 00:06:00,693
I'll need to consult
these ancient writings.

105
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:06,951
Some preposterous hogwash...

106
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:09,236
About the Fibonacci sequence...

107
00:06:10,764 --> 00:06:13,982
The markings indicate
how many paces we need to take.

108
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:16,667
One...

109
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,711
Okay, we're there.

110
00:06:19,304 --> 00:06:21,829
Brothers and sisters, let us pry.

111
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
It's true!

112
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,403
Saint James really was a robot.

113
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,352
I bet he's up
in Robot Heaven right now.

114
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:36,333
So he won't miss his eyes.

115
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,868
My God!
Robot Saint James is a zombie.

116
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,662
Nay, I am not Saint James.

117
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,808
Enough of your lies, Saint James.

118
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:57,666
We saw you in The Last Supper.

119
00:06:57,937 --> 00:07:01,665
The great man Leonardo
built me as an artist's model.

120
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,587
When I took repose in this coffin,

121
00:07:03,712 --> 00:07:05,901
I carefully tossed
the real Saint James

122
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:07,267
in yonder heap.

123
00:07:08,364 --> 00:07:10,409
I'm sure you have many questions.

124
00:07:10,534 --> 00:07:11,930
Come, there is a chamber

125
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,767
where I used to speak
with Pope John the Patient.

126
00:07:17,953 --> 00:07:20,396
I told him
I'd be back in five minutes.

127
00:07:21,505 --> 00:07:23,009
He'll make a nice heap.

128
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:27,948
I am Animatronio,

129
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:30,783
guardian of da Vinci's great secret.

130
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,577
He left my legs visible
in the painting as a clue,

131
00:07:33,702 --> 00:07:37,193
then dispatched me hither
to await his shadow society

132
00:07:37,318 --> 00:07:38,916
of intellectuals.

133
00:07:39,736 --> 00:07:40,918
Hi, Animatronio.

134
00:07:41,178 --> 00:07:43,621
You personally knew da Vinci?

135
00:07:45,126 --> 00:07:47,257
Was he nice?
How did his hair smell?

136
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:48,698
And on a personal note,

137
00:07:48,823 --> 00:07:50,761
what is the function of this device?

138
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:54,672
Halt! You know not the function
of the <i>Machina Magnifica</i>?

139
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,060
Then thou art not members
of the shadow society!

140
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:01,384
- The what, now?
- Not one more word shall I breathe.

141
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:05,444
Not even about the great fountain
where thou mayest find the...

142
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:06,569
Wait...

143
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,469
Thou didst not know about the fountain,
didst thou?

144
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:11,653
Curses!
I must be punished.

145
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,433
Quick, we must find out what he knows,
before he flays himself to death.

146
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,422
- Where is the great fountain?
- What makes it so great?

147
00:08:21,547 --> 00:08:23,198
Why does a robot need a codpiece?

148
00:08:23,323 --> 00:08:25,754
Fie, thou fen-suckled bumbailey!

149
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,461
Thou willst never pry information
from these mechanical lips!

150
00:08:29,696 --> 00:08:31,192
Just tell us, already.

151
00:08:31,317 --> 00:08:33,807
Okay,
the fountain thou seekest is...

152
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,852
And so dies our hope
of solving this mystery.

153
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:42,703
Come on, gang.
Let's go home.

154
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:45,060
Wait! Let's not give up so easily.

155
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:47,581
Animatronio mentioned a fountain.

156
00:08:47,893 --> 00:08:50,779
That's a statue of Neptune,
god of water.

157
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,616
The number of points on his trident
is three, or "trey."

158
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:57,564
The "U" in his name
is written like "V."

159
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,189
Trey... V...

160
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,351
Trey...

161
00:09:00,476 --> 00:09:02,988
Trevi!
It's the Trevi Fountain!

162
00:09:03,113 --> 00:09:05,043
There can be no question!

163
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,546
- But Professor...?
- There can be no question!

164
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,433
It hasn't changed
in a thousand years.

165
00:09:16,146 --> 00:09:18,642
Okay, everyone, into the fountain.

166
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,232
What are you, senile?
I'm not jumping in there.

167
00:09:21,357 --> 00:09:22,555
Look... coins.

168
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,206
I got 48 cents.

169
00:09:47,526 --> 00:09:50,023
There's one more nickel,
and it's a big one!

170
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:06,647
Quickly, into the sewer hole.

171
00:10:09,728 --> 00:10:10,728
Why?

172
00:10:25,898 --> 00:10:27,182
What's this dump?

173
00:10:36,298 --> 00:10:37,595
It's the Pantheon!

174
00:10:37,865 --> 00:10:40,055
This place is 3,000 years old.

175
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:42,514
What could possibly be left
to discover?

176
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:45,196
Maybe something about ourselves.

177
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:47,575
Wait! What's under that blanket?

178
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,413
Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man!

179
00:10:52,683 --> 00:10:54,551
It's truly a masterpiece.

180
00:10:54,676 --> 00:10:58,407
Note how the perspective lines
draw the eye right to his dong.

181
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,592
Say, what's this?

182
00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:04,413
Anyone hear something?

183
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,747
It's a coin slot.

184
00:11:06,147 --> 00:11:08,133
Bender, insert that giant nickel.

185
00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:09,485
Sure.

186
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:15,799
Hush, Bender!

187
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,204
What's your game, Vitruvian Man?

188
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:32,083
I withdraw the question,
Vitruvian Man.

189
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:35,777
Da Vinci's lost workshop.

190
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:39,281
At the risk of sounding stupid,
do these things actually work?

191
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,151
Of course not, stupid!

192
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:45,061
That flying machine's
as aerodynamic as a sofa!

193
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,967
How could it possibly
get off the ground?

194
00:11:48,092 --> 00:11:50,899
In a way thou shalt ne'er discover!

195
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,005
Hi, Animatronio.

196
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,267
I feign death and stalk thee,

197
00:11:57,392 --> 00:12:00,551
that I might preserve
the greatest of Leonardo's secrets.

198
00:12:05,534 --> 00:12:06,683
All right, buddy,

199
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,519
we want secrets.
And they better be ancient!

200
00:12:09,926 --> 00:12:12,731
<i>Porco metallico!</i>
Ne'er shall I reveal

201
00:12:13,102 --> 00:12:15,440
how these wondrous machines
fit together!

202
00:12:15,565 --> 00:12:16,985
They fit together?

203
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,426
I said no such thing.
And then I died!

204
00:12:23,866 --> 00:12:26,258
You're right, Professor.
This thing doesn't fly.

205
00:12:26,383 --> 00:12:27,913
Don't sit in there, you idiot!

206
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,434
That's dangerous!

207
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:56,525
No wonder this contraption
isn't aerodynamic!

208
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,110
It's not an aircraft,

209
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,650
it's a spacecraft!

210
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,483
<i>Basta!</i> As I live,

211
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:04,976
thou shan't discover
the great secret!

212
00:13:12,066 --> 00:13:13,969
Bye, Animatronio!

213
00:13:43,165 --> 00:13:46,106
Why would Leonardo's machine
have brought us here?

214
00:13:46,231 --> 00:13:48,618
I don't know, let's ask this guy.

215
00:13:49,014 --> 00:13:51,068
I am Leonardo.

216
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,583
Welcome to planet Vinci.

217
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:03,039
That's what I was gonna say!

218
00:14:11,132 --> 00:14:13,284
You're alive? Here?

219
00:14:14,397 --> 00:14:16,419
You've learned my great secret.

220
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:18,523
I was but a visitor to Earth.

221
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,943
In truth,
I am what you call "a space alien."

222
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:24,855
It's an honor to meet you, Leonardo.

223
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,320
And might I say,
you were great in <i>Titanic.</i>

224
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,556
<i>The Beach...</i>

225
00:14:29,112 --> 00:14:32,098
That's Leonardo DiCaprio,
you blockhead!

226
00:14:34,055 --> 00:14:36,583
Looks like eating rocks
wasn't as dumb as you said.

227
00:14:40,276 --> 00:14:41,880
So what do people do for fun here?

228
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,059
Do you enjoy partying all night,

229
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:46,730
with plenty of ale and lusty women?

230
00:14:46,855 --> 00:14:48,833
- I sure do!
- Not us.

231
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,525
We spend our leisure time
in the mathematics museum.

232
00:14:54,136 --> 00:14:55,227
Planet Vinci

233
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,536
is basically
a single colossal university.

234
00:14:58,751 --> 00:15:00,978
- How's your football team?
- Learned.

235
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,319
I'm going to check out
that math lecture.

236
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:08,077
All this knowledge
is giving me a raging "brainer."

237
00:15:08,682 --> 00:15:11,331
Would you like to hear
the lecture, too, Fry?

238
00:15:11,456 --> 00:15:14,329
No. It would just go in one ear
and our some other hole.

239
00:15:14,676 --> 00:15:16,248
Come. Sit down.

240
00:15:16,578 --> 00:15:17,930
Now, that I can do.

241
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,243
I have a terrible secret to confess,
Mr. DiCaprio.

242
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:24,172
I'm not very smart.

243
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,299
I appreciate your candor.

244
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:29,761
I don't even know
what language you're speaking.

245
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:32,988
I, too, have a confession.

246
00:15:33,637 --> 00:15:35,939
You see, here on planet Vinci,

247
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:38,383
I am the stupidest person.

248
00:15:38,631 --> 00:15:41,147
What?
Who'd possibly think you're stupid?

249
00:15:41,896 --> 00:15:42,941
I'm Leonardo!

250
00:15:43,258 --> 00:15:45,647
I don't know the mass
of the Higgs boson.

251
00:15:46,593 --> 00:15:48,193
I have to draw in pencil,

252
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:51,449
'cause I don't know how to use
rendering software.

253
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,996
Stupid Biff!

254
00:15:56,283 --> 00:15:59,207
- Thinks he's so smart.
- He looks stronger than you, too.

255
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,534
I went to Earth

256
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,226
because I could no longer stand
the ridicule.

257
00:16:03,475 --> 00:16:06,816
But being surrounded
by even stupider people

258
00:16:06,941 --> 00:16:08,508
was equally infuriating.

259
00:16:08,821 --> 00:16:10,983
I can see myself
in your shiny button.

260
00:16:11,108 --> 00:16:13,264
Inventing is what makes me happy.

261
00:16:13,492 --> 00:16:16,725
Or did, until I misplaced the plans
for my masterpiece.

262
00:16:17,037 --> 00:16:18,059
You mean these?

263
00:16:19,232 --> 00:16:21,313
The <i>Machina Magnifica!</i>

264
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:23,255
Infinite joy!

265
00:16:23,752 --> 00:16:27,309
Fry, my friend,
you have given my life meaning again!

266
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:30,790
That calculus lecture was harder
than I expected.

267
00:16:30,915 --> 00:16:33,825
We had to answer every question
in the form of an opera.

268
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:37,605
I have a lot of homework for tomorrow,
if I don't want to be...

269
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,746
embarrassed.

270
00:17:31,857 --> 00:17:33,343
Thank you. Thank you.

271
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:36,179
And if you like that,
you'll love our main event.

272
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,872
Ladies and gentlemen...

273
00:17:37,997 --> 00:17:39,989
Leonardo DiCaprio!

274
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,312
I mean da Vinci!

275
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,584
For centuries, you've ridiculed me.

276
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:53,446
Especially you, Biff.

277
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:54,828
Nice hat!

278
00:17:56,798 --> 00:17:58,408
But, at long last,

279
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,841
this invention will show you.

280
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,330
'Twill show you all!

281
00:18:03,144 --> 00:18:04,082
Behold,

282
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,611
my unstoppable doomsday machine!

283
00:18:07,736 --> 00:18:09,622
And I helped! Wait...

284
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,606
You told me it was
an unstoppable ice cream machine.

285
00:18:12,731 --> 00:18:15,275
Ice cream is just a byproduct
of the machine.

286
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:18,263
Its primary purpose
is to exterminate

287
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,182
everyone who ever
made me feel inferior!

288
00:18:22,443 --> 00:18:24,338
I'm so scared!

289
00:18:24,878 --> 00:18:26,965
Bring it on, dum-dum!

290
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:33,069
Oh, yeah?
Let's see how hard you're laughing

291
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:36,589
when my doomsday machine
chops off your face!

292
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:49,878
Leonardo, stop!

293
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,876
I want in on this!

294
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,854
Are you crazy, Professor?

295
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:56,714
I hate these nerds!

296
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:00,670
Just 'cause I'm stupider than them,
they think they're smarter than me.

297
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,260
Kill them all...

298
00:19:02,385 --> 00:19:04,893
starting with the math teacher!

299
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:21,871
I knew this final invention
would be a humdinger.

300
00:19:22,856 --> 00:19:26,143
We three idiots
will finally have our revenge.

301
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:27,865
I don't think so.

302
00:19:28,287 --> 00:19:32,253
You two make me ashamed
to call myself an idiot.

303
00:19:36,534 --> 00:19:38,760
There's always going
to be someone smarter than you,

304
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,930
so the only way to be happy
is to make the most of what you've got.

305
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,515
But you've got nothing.

306
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,404
Oh, no?
I've got one single nail,

307
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:48,669
and another nail to nail it in with,

308
00:19:48,794 --> 00:19:52,315
and I'm gonna stop this infernal
ice cream machine once and for all.

309
00:20:14,784 --> 00:20:16,438
Some doomsday machine!

310
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:18,132
It barely killed anyone!

311
00:20:20,622 --> 00:20:21,822
Well, take this!

312
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:27,905
Poor Leonardo da Vinci.

313
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:30,437
He sure was stupid.

314
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,151
Fry, I admire what you did today

315
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,681
and I'm deeply sorry
for insulting your intellect...

316
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:42,514
Your tiny, tiny intellect.

317
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,978
There I go again, you dope.
I mean, dummy.

318
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:48,226
It's okay.
I may not be clever,

319
00:20:48,351 --> 00:20:49,783
but I have a good heart.

320
00:20:49,908 --> 00:20:51,534
That's what my mom used to say.

321
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:53,426
She was a wise woman.

322
00:20:53,992 --> 00:20:55,992
Also that I'm not much to look at.

323
00:20:56,117 --> 00:20:58,544
A wise woman indeed.
