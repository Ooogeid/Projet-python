00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,758
Cash, cash, cash for your bones.

2
00:00:01,883 --> 00:00:04,503
Too many bones, not enough cash?
Call Cashbone!

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,465
Ribs, skulls, spines,
even certain tiny ear bones.

4
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,998
The leg bone's connected
to the Cashbone.

00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,269
Nibbler made a bobo for Mama.

8
00:00:47,537 --> 00:00:50,841
I'll pick it up
with my supey-dupey poopy scoopy.

9
00:01:01,805 --> 00:01:04,483
Core magnetic field...
31 microteslas.

10
00:01:04,608 --> 00:01:05,463
Nice.

11
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,065
Temperature...

12
00:01:08,045 --> 00:01:10,898
The magma P.I.
is 10,000 degrees selleck.

13
00:01:15,523 --> 00:01:18,411
I am collecting data.
Could you dump that somewhere else?

14
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,446
Not really.
It's highly volatile dark matter...

15
00:01:21,993 --> 00:01:22,999
And some corn.

16
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:27,399
But I'm presenting my thesis tomorrow
and I've barely had time to prepare.

17
00:01:27,524 --> 00:01:28,662
Nonsense.

18
00:01:28,787 --> 00:01:31,579
You've been my grad student
for 12 years.

19
00:01:31,704 --> 00:01:33,426
You were ready six years ago.

20
00:01:33,648 --> 00:01:36,402
- What?
- I probably should have told you.

21
00:01:36,527 --> 00:01:39,764
Anyway, the important thing
is to be relaxed tomorrow.

22
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,851
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

23
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,466
Do what you young people do
to unwind.

24
00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:46,705
Take a joyride in your jalopy.

25
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,108
Wear a T-shirt and eat a fish stick.

26
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:50,359
Go!

27
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:01,002
Okay, amigos, one teensy drink
to help Amy relax.

28
00:02:01,317 --> 00:02:02,618
Hear, hear!

29
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,045
I guess I'm still kind of nervous.

30
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:12,002
One more teensy drink
to help Amy relax.

31
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:17,762
Still a little nervous?

32
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:20,331
She's a nervous wreck!

33
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:39,242
Well, I may not have a man,

34
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,744
but at least I've got you,
poopsie-doodle.

35
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:47,765
It's time you and I had a talk.

36
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,812
A talk?

37
00:02:48,937 --> 00:02:51,087
You can't break up with me.
You're my pet.

38
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:55,172
As much as I enjoy being the object
of your misplaced affections,

39
00:02:55,297 --> 00:02:59,458
I am also a highly sophisticated being
who longs for intelligent conversation.

40
00:03:00,744 --> 00:03:02,974
Is shnookums
not feeling "shtimuwated"?

41
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:07,205
An understatement to say the least.
It's time you treated me with respect.

42
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,783
If you want to be treated
like a fellow crew member, fine,

43
00:03:10,908 --> 00:03:12,396
but no more purse rides

44
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:15,403
and no more dressing you up
in your cute little sailor suit.

45
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:18,698
I keep telling you,
that's my real naval uniform.

46
00:03:21,554 --> 00:03:23,801
- Your place or mine?
- Both.

47
00:03:23,926 --> 00:03:25,444
But first, this place.

48
00:03:30,064 --> 00:03:31,586
Room for one more?

49
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:42,180
I thought I set you for 7:15.

50
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:45,324
Sorry.
I hooked up with Bender last night.

51
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:47,727
Dude was all over my snooze button.

52
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,992
But my doctoral exam
is in ten minutes,

53
00:03:51,117 --> 00:03:52,187
on Mars!

54
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,017
Kif, did you yack on the floor?

55
00:03:57,142 --> 00:03:59,130
Yes, I did.

56
00:04:08,586 --> 00:04:10,249
Where's your candidate?

57
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,920
I have a long list of students
to humiliate today.

58
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,924
- You're late, Miss Wong.
- Oh, God,

59
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,059
this is like one
of those nightmares.

60
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,180
Here, take my lab coat.

61
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,479
Allow me to introduce
your examining committee

62
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:29,560
in descending order of grumpiness.

63
00:04:29,808 --> 00:04:31,771
Professor Ogden Wernstrom.

64
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,356
Wernstrom.

65
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:35,448
Downtown Professor
of applied physics:

66
00:04:35,573 --> 00:04:37,107
Ethan "Bubblegum" Tate.

67
00:04:37,232 --> 00:04:39,226
I see by your curriculum vitae

68
00:04:39,455 --> 00:04:40,947
that you're a sagittarius.

69
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:43,572
And Professor
Fischerpreis Schpeeknschpell.

70
00:04:44,252 --> 00:04:45,502
The cow says...

71
00:04:47,271 --> 00:04:49,222
He proved that 50 years ago,

72
00:04:49,347 --> 00:04:51,374
and he's been coasting on it
ever since.

73
00:04:51,814 --> 00:04:54,083
I am the esteemed
Professor Morris Katz,

74
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,212
and you are wasting my time.

75
00:04:56,595 --> 00:04:57,433
Proceed.

76
00:04:58,805 --> 00:05:01,050
- Imagine, if you will...
- Oh, God.

77
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:03,616
A gigantic spherical generator,

78
00:05:03,741 --> 00:05:05,812
one that could provide
unlimited energy

79
00:05:05,937 --> 00:05:08,307
because it's essentially
in perpetual motion.

80
00:05:09,432 --> 00:05:11,644
Young lady, have you been drinking?

81
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,804
Yes, but that's not revelant.

82
00:05:14,929 --> 00:05:16,674
I'm talking about Earth.

83
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:18,568
Earth's the Generator.

84
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:23,197
Suppose this basketball
is the whole world.

85
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:26,242
To many young men
in the inner city, it is.

86
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,966
As it spins, it's producing
an enormous magnetic field.

87
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:33,166
If we could use that field
to generate electric current,

88
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:36,391
we could actually harness
the Earth's rotational ener...

89
00:05:36,516 --> 00:05:37,962
ener... kerchoo!

90
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:41,966
Tapping the Earth's ener-kerchoo.
Go on.

91
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,594
Sorry, I'm super allergic to cats.

92
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,596
Professor Katz, would you mind?

93
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:48,431
Miss wong, I mind everything.

94
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:53,749
You just need to polarize
the earth's core with a huge...

95
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,439
Static charge...

96
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:59,484
By ratcheting superconductive
wire down into...

97
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:01,652
Sorry.

98
00:06:02,588 --> 00:06:03,493
Enough.

99
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:05,750
The committee members
will now vote yay or nay.

100
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,443
- Nay.
- Nay.

101
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:08,576
Hell, nay.

102
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:12,872
The horse says: "doctorate denied."

103
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:24,175
It's okay, Amy.

104
00:06:24,405 --> 00:06:26,225
I don't have a fancy degree either,

105
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,847
but today I'm a prominent boy
in the package delivery field.

106
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:39,190
Now that I am a full
and equal member of the crew,

107
00:06:39,423 --> 00:06:42,279
I pledge my loyalty,
my perspicacity,

108
00:06:42,404 --> 00:06:44,911
and dare I say it, my friendship.

109
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:46,801
Leela, muzzle that skunk.

110
00:06:46,926 --> 00:06:49,200
We can't stop a meeting
for some cute, fuzzy, little...

111
00:06:49,754 --> 00:06:51,542
Look, a kitty cat.

112
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,371
You again?

113
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:57,272
Get away,
you mangy ball of histamines!

114
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,183
You leave kitty cat alone.

115
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:03,992
People, please,
I'm trying to run a business,

116
00:07:04,117 --> 00:07:06,259
- so I get to hold kitty.
- No, me.

117
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:11,014
Its anus looks like an asterisk.

118
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,516
Captain Fuzzy Toes
reporting for duty...

119
00:07:17,993 --> 00:07:19,223
I mean, cutie.

120
00:07:21,387 --> 00:07:24,068
My best friend died in that uniform.

121
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:25,578
I hate that cat!

122
00:07:25,703 --> 00:07:28,990
If I had a spray bottle,
I'd give him such a spritzing.

123
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:30,544
I'll tell you one thing...

124
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:33,822
Nothing acts that cute
without some ulterior motive.

125
00:07:38,342 --> 00:07:41,753
You want your dipey changed?

126
00:07:42,068 --> 00:07:44,704
We'll have to watch its every move.

127
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:47,107
Powder, please.

128
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:11,658
Here's my new theory:
That is one adorable cat.

129
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:13,744
I guess I was just jealous.

130
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:16,610
I do miss being Leela's shnookums.

131
00:08:16,735 --> 00:08:19,499
I'm going to apologize
and hope for a pity pet.

132
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:22,248
Yes, my lord.

133
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:24,721
Amy and Nibbler
are a "tewwible thweat."

134
00:08:24,846 --> 00:08:27,674
They must be spayed
and neutered, "wespectivewy."

135
00:08:45,373 --> 00:08:47,710
The cat is evil.
We have proof.

136
00:08:47,835 --> 00:08:49,237
It was summoning a saucer.

137
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:51,990
Of course it wanted a saucer,
you idiot...

138
00:08:52,538 --> 00:08:55,227
A saucer of "dewicious cweam."

139
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:58,579
You fool,
this isn't about the cream.

140
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,647
It's pwonounced "cweam."

141
00:09:01,772 --> 00:09:04,043
I'm petting mine down to the bone.

142
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:07,005
Just stwoke its fwuffy fur.

143
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:09,591
Scwatch its fwubby chin.

144
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,427
Fweeble its fwooby pwow.

145
00:09:12,859 --> 00:09:14,846
Pet it, pet it...

146
00:09:33,812 --> 00:09:36,659
What do cats need
with that much yarn and cobalt?

147
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:40,193
They're doing something downstairs.
We've got to find out what.

148
00:09:42,044 --> 00:09:44,584
Where do you think
you're going, no-cat?

149
00:09:45,622 --> 00:09:48,338
The basement.
I left the air-hockey table on.

150
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:49,904
Without a cat,

151
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:52,204
you ain't going nowhere.

152
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:54,802
Can you tell us
what's going on down there?

153
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,349
We're certainly not building
something sinister,

154
00:09:57,474 --> 00:09:59,057
if that's what you're implying.

155
00:09:59,394 --> 00:10:03,116
Come on, Bender,
something sinister won't build itself.

156
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:09,262
Professor Katz's last name is Katz.

157
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,778
Do you think he has something to do
with these cats?

158
00:10:12,114 --> 00:10:15,073
The conclusion is as inescapable
as it is moronic.

159
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:17,206
I say we pay him a visit,

160
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:21,105
and if he won't talk to us,
he'll talk to Smith & Wesson.

161
00:10:21,894 --> 00:10:24,283
Or perhaps Consolidated Head Melter.

162
00:10:45,535 --> 00:10:47,981
Professor Katz, we want answers.

163
00:10:50,602 --> 00:10:51,867
I warn you,

164
00:10:51,992 --> 00:10:54,696
if I have to get cute,
it's gonna get ugly.

165
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,018
He's dead!

166
00:11:00,295 --> 00:11:02,620
Wait.
What are these strings on his lap?

167
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,791
What the...?
He isn't dead.

168
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,124
He's one
of those dog-operated puppets

169
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:11,379
that's been adapted
for use by a cat!

170
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:13,631
So I had my doctorate denied

171
00:11:13,966 --> 00:11:15,373
by that fuzz ball?

172
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,218
Bad kitty!

173
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,617
They built the planetary ratchet
from my thesis!

174
00:11:52,677 --> 00:11:54,839
Look what the me dragged in.

175
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,407
- You can talk!
- You can talk?

176
00:11:57,532 --> 00:11:58,753
How ironic!

177
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:01,142
Two hyper-intelligent beings both

178
00:12:01,267 --> 00:12:03,484
pretending to be simple house pets.

179
00:12:03,609 --> 00:12:05,266
Say, do you know Obliteron?

180
00:12:05,631 --> 00:12:08,102
He pretends to be a hamster, but...

181
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,147
That's really great. Could you please
tell us what's going on?

182
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,009
What? Right.

183
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,146
You see, my associates and I

184
00:12:15,271 --> 00:12:18,263
are from the ninth planet
of the star you call Thuban.

185
00:12:18,676 --> 00:12:21,574
Long ago, life there was ideal.

186
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,120
<i>The sun provided plenty of warm,
dozy light.</i>

187
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,233
<i>The chicken-salmon roamed free.</i>

188
00:12:29,976 --> 00:12:30,708
<i>Yet,</i>

189
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,300
<i>disaster loomed.</i>

190
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,213
<i>Our planet's rotation
was gradually slowing.</i>

191
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:37,392
<i>At first, it seemed beneficial.</i>

192
00:12:37,517 --> 00:12:39,662
<i>Long dark nights for sleeping,</i>

193
00:12:39,787 --> 00:12:42,075
<i>long sunny days for sleeping.</i>

194
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:44,229
<i>But then, it got too hot.</i>

195
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,867
<i>And too cold.</i>

196
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,152
<i>Our top scientists went to work.</i>

197
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:57,403
<i>At last, they located a planet
with the necessary orientation</i>

198
00:12:57,528 --> 00:13:00,635
<i>and magnetic field
to harness its rotational energy.</i>

199
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:02,657
Earth!

200
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:05,660
Indubitably. Although we call it
blue-blue shiny ball.

201
00:13:12,396 --> 00:13:14,210
<i>In the area now known as Egypt,</i>

202
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:17,986
<i>my people constructed a giant,
semi-octahedral antenna</i>

203
00:13:18,223 --> 00:13:20,738
<i>to beam earth's rotational energy
to Thuban.</i>

204
00:13:20,863 --> 00:13:22,734
The great pyramid at Giza!

205
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:26,209
<i>The Egyptians viewed us as gods,</i>

206
00:13:26,334 --> 00:13:29,123
<i>but ironically,
that was our downfall.</i>

207
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,437
<i>They pampered us
with feasts most fancy</i>

208
00:13:32,605 --> 00:13:34,150
<i>and vittles most tender.</i>

209
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:36,879
<i>We grew fat and domesticated.</i>

210
00:13:37,988 --> 00:13:39,944
Thousands of years passed,

211
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:43,209
<i>and our home world
was nearing total destruction.</i>

212
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:48,864
Shut up!

213
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:53,352
But the technology
to save our planet was lost.

214
00:13:53,477 --> 00:13:57,481
Lost, that is, until I heard you speak
at Mars University.

215
00:13:57,696 --> 00:14:00,173
So you called my thesis
a fat sack of barf,

216
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:01,591
and then you stole it?

217
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,121
Welcome to Academia.

218
00:14:03,246 --> 00:14:06,262
He intends to siphon off
earth's rotational energy!

219
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,139
Earth will come to a stop, and...

220
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:11,146
Half of you will cook,
and half of you will freeze.

221
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:13,876
Earth will be one big McDLT.

222
00:14:14,211 --> 00:14:15,980
We just got that commercial
last year.

223
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,484
Yeah, smartly paws?
You may have built the ratchet,

224
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:22,533
but you can't reach the core
without 4,000 miles

225
00:14:22,658 --> 00:14:25,698
of superconducting wire.
The ball of yarn!

226
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:33,998
Quite.

227
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,293
Even so,

228
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:37,894
you'd still need
a tremendously powerful static charge

229
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:39,337
to trigger the process.

230
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,464
Ever had a cat rub up against you?

231
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:44,426
If you're propositioning me,
I'm not interested.

232
00:14:44,594 --> 00:14:46,423
I'm talking about
the charge generated

233
00:14:46,548 --> 00:14:48,699
when 50,000 felines

234
00:14:48,824 --> 00:14:50,830
rub against a single surface.

235
00:15:22,228 --> 00:15:24,483
Soon the world will come to a stop,

236
00:15:24,608 --> 00:15:27,117
and there's nothing you can do
to stop it.

237
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:30,829
The stopping of the world, that is.
It's unstoppable.

238
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,417
Excuse me.

239
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:44,817
The Earth is coming to a stop!

240
00:15:44,942 --> 00:15:47,030
Keep your eyes on the kitties
and push!

241
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,552
These space cats

242
00:15:52,677 --> 00:15:56,156
seem to be employing some form
of hypnotic hyper-cuteness.

243
00:15:56,281 --> 00:15:59,125
Two can play at that game.
And one of them is me.

244
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:04,714
Nibbler? Poopsie-doodle?

245
00:16:06,738 --> 00:16:10,011
Mr. Winkles, Smudge-smudge.
Quick, dance with each other!

246
00:16:15,472 --> 00:16:17,382
Damn, they are good.

247
00:16:21,323 --> 00:16:24,526
We're coming to a full stop.
All cats, to your posts!

248
00:16:36,781 --> 00:16:39,249
Catastrophic beach party...
Scene one.

249
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:41,710
Cue disaster effects and... action!

250
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:48,049
Cut!

251
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:51,052
That extra looked at the camera.
We'll have to do it again.

252
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:57,593
And now to transfer
your planet's rotational energy

253
00:16:57,718 --> 00:16:58,768
to my home world.

254
00:17:15,912 --> 00:17:17,037
Well, now,

255
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:19,414
this calls for a celebration.

256
00:17:29,374 --> 00:17:31,694
What's all this cat hair
on my sweater?

257
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:34,899
Why am I full of sand?

258
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,556
And Tootsie Rolls?

259
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:39,768
You were all under the spell
of those obnoxious space cats!

260
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:42,979
Enjoy being broiled alive
by the sun,

261
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:45,963
and also the dead bird
we've left in your slipper.

262
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:52,208
Quickly! If we turn the ratchet
the other way,

263
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,658
perhaps we can restart the earth!

264
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,787
It won't turn.

265
00:17:58,955 --> 00:18:01,592
- Push harder, Bender!
- I can't!

266
00:18:01,717 --> 00:18:03,959
You should have called my cousin,
Turner.

267
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,128
It's hopeless.

268
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:08,288
Even in theory,

269
00:18:08,413 --> 00:18:10,799
the device can only apply force
in one direction.

270
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:13,760
Can someone open a window?
It's getting a little warm in here.

271
00:18:16,631 --> 00:18:17,847
Is that better?

272
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:27,649
Shmeezus, it's hot!

273
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:30,743
Why'd I have to invent
that awful device?

274
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,677
Technology isn't intrinsically
good or evil.

275
00:18:36,802 --> 00:18:39,953
It's how it's used.
Like the death ray.

276
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:41,650
Maybe you're right.

277
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:44,166
I guess science
has to keep pushing forward

278
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,637
with the hope that...
That's it!

279
00:18:46,762 --> 00:18:48,169
Pushing forward!

280
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:50,839
Professor,
I know how to restart the earth!

281
00:18:51,694 --> 00:18:55,620
You can't suddenly know something
by assembling a committee of words.

282
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:59,593
That's it!
I'll assemble your committee!

283
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,058
The ratchet won't turn backwards,

284
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:04,687
but what
if we kept pushing it forward?

285
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:06,646
Earth would start turning again!

286
00:19:06,985 --> 00:19:09,218
Yes... the wrong direction!

287
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,860
So?

288
00:19:13,772 --> 00:19:14,776
Gentlemen,

289
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:16,003
ladies,

290
00:19:16,324 --> 00:19:18,174
let's get this globe trotting.

291
00:19:22,702 --> 00:19:25,874
It's working!
Just a little faster!

292
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:27,709
But we're plotzing here!

293
00:19:27,877 --> 00:19:29,210
Then look at Nibbler!

294
00:19:46,437 --> 00:19:49,231
On the whole,
earth society is worthless.

295
00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:52,100
But they do have these things
called antique rugs

296
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,064
that are great for peeing on.

297
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,098
Good show.

298
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:15,254
And though the world is now spinning
in the wrong direction,

299
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:16,466
it's good enough.

300
00:20:16,786 --> 00:20:18,081
Well done, Amy.

301
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,707
I'm honored to begrudgingly present
with your PHD.

302
00:20:21,832 --> 00:20:23,316
In applied physics.

303
00:20:23,441 --> 00:20:25,965
Also, some kind
of sportsmanship award

304
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,567
I had in my glove compartment.

305
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:32,274
I'm finally done with school!
How's the job market?

306
00:20:33,212 --> 00:20:33,984
Ruff.

307
00:20:34,152 --> 00:20:36,773
Congratulations, Dr. Wong!

308
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,345
Permission to come aboard?

309
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,112
Granted, shnookums.

310
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:54,524
You've got a bright future, Amy.

311
00:20:54,649 --> 00:20:57,654
As sure as the Sun sets in the east.
