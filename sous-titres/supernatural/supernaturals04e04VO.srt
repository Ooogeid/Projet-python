1
00:00:02,165 --> 00:00:02,953
Mom.

2
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:05,425
Mom is a babe.

3
00:00:09,464 --> 00:00:10,474
Are you a hunter?

4
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:12,182
Winchester! Son of a bitch!

5
00:00:12,342 --> 00:00:14,476
- How you doin', corporal?
- Hey, Mr. D.

6
00:00:17,045 --> 00:00:17,896
Dad?

7
00:00:18,056 --> 00:00:20,273
- This is gonna sound a little crazy.
- Mary is my mother.

8
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:22,215
- Excuse me?
- And I am your grandson.

9
00:00:22,393 --> 00:00:24,918
My parents are Mary and John Winchester.

10
00:00:25,038 --> 00:00:25,987
I don't know --

11
00:00:26,147 --> 00:00:28,146
Mary gets killed by a yellow-eyed demon.

12
00:00:31,069 --> 00:00:33,870
- You don't want those people's souls.
- No, I just want their children.

13
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:34,991
Why any of them?

14
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:39,118
I'm gonna stand over their crib,
and I'm gonna bleed into their mouths.

15
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:41,527
So, you've been using
your freaky E.S.P. stuff?

16
00:00:41,647 --> 00:00:42,901
- No.
- Sure about that?

17
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:44,708
You didn't want me
to go down that road,

18
00:00:44,828 --> 00:00:47,300
- so I didn't go down that road.
- Well, let's keep it that way.

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,590
We know what Azazel did to your brother.
What we don't know is why.

20
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,889
Your brother is heading down
a dangerous road,

21
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:54,136
So stop it...

22
00:00:55,272 --> 00:00:56,332
Or we will.

23
00:01:09,557 --> 00:01:10,895
Where's Lilith?

24
00:01:11,477 --> 00:01:12,570
Kiss my ass.

25
00:01:14,587 --> 00:01:16,079
I'd watch myself if I were you.

26
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,013
Why?

27
00:01:18,718 --> 00:01:21,459
Because you're Sam Winchester,
Mr. Big hero?

28
00:01:24,457 --> 00:01:28,186
And yet here you are,
slutting around with some demon.

29
00:01:29,764 --> 00:01:31,216
- Real hero.
- Shut your mouth.

30
00:01:31,336 --> 00:01:33,304
Tell me about those months
without your brother...

31
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:37,767
About all the things you
and this demon bitch do in the dark.

32
00:01:41,274 --> 00:01:42,401
Tell me, hero.

33
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:55,777
How'd it feel?

34
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:56,930
Good.

35
00:02:57,533 --> 00:02:59,282
- No more headaches.
- None?

36
00:02:59,402 --> 00:03:00,465
That is good.

37
00:03:02,262 --> 00:03:04,092
I got you.
It's all right.

38
00:03:13,681 --> 00:03:14,697
So...

39
00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:17,470
Anything you want to tell me, Sam?

40
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,845
Dean, hold on, okay?

41
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:21,249
- Just let me...
- You gonna say, "let me explain"?

42
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:24,435
You're gonna explain this?

43
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,473
How about this?
Why don't you start with

44
00:03:26,593 --> 00:03:28,302
who she is...

45
00:03:28,954 --> 00:03:30,505
and what the hell is she doing here?

46
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:37,452
It's good to see you again, Dean.

47
00:03:38,907 --> 00:03:39,681
Ruby?

48
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:42,976
Is that ruby?

49
00:03:51,394 --> 00:03:52,302
Don't!

50
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,241
Ruby, stop it.

51
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:09,365
Well, aren't you an obedient
little bitch?

52
00:04:12,524 --> 00:04:13,331
Ruby.

53
00:04:14,638 --> 00:04:16,384
Ruby... he's hurt.

54
00:04:17,835 --> 00:04:18,570
Go.

55
00:04:24,135 --> 00:04:25,893
Where the hell do you think
you're going?

56
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:28,967
The e.r... unless you want
to go another round first.

57
00:05:09,572 --> 00:05:11,171
Dean, what are you doing?

58
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,226
What, are you...
Are you leaving?

59
00:05:14,346 --> 00:05:15,540
You don't need me.

60
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,070
You and ruby go fight demons.

61
00:05:17,532 --> 00:05:18,413
Hold on.

62
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:20,067
Dean, come on, man.

63
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:27,971
You satisfied?

64
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:33,642
I guess not.

65
00:05:33,762 --> 00:05:36,438
Do you even know how far
off the reservation you've gone?

66
00:05:36,642 --> 00:05:38,675
How far from normal?
From human?

67
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:41,660
- I'm just exorcising demons.
- With your mind!

68
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:45,892
What else can you do?

69
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,646
I can send them back to hell.

70
00:05:48,188 --> 00:05:50,087
It only works with demons, and that's it.

71
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,386
- What else can you do?!
- I told you!

72
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:57,026
And I have every reason
in the world to believe that.

73
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:00,230
Look, I should have said something.

74
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,098
I'm sorry, Dean.
I am.

75
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:04,918
- But try to see the other side here.
- The other side?!

76
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:06,918
I'm pulling demons out
of innocent people.

77
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:09,007
- Use the knife!
- The knife kills the victim!

78
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:10,748
What I do, most of them survive!

79
00:06:11,793 --> 00:06:13,835
Look, I've saved more people in
the last five months

80
00:06:13,995 --> 00:06:15,659
than we save in a year.

81
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:20,898
That what ruby wants you to think?

82
00:06:22,522 --> 00:06:25,157
Kind of like the way she
tricked you into using your powers?

83
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,014
Slippery slope, brother.

84
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:30,226
Just wait and see.

85
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:32,645
Because it's gonna get darker

86
00:06:32,805 --> 00:06:34,034
and darker,

87
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:36,024
and god knows where it ends.

88
00:06:36,144 --> 00:06:37,832
I'm not gonna let it go too far.

89
00:06:41,988 --> 00:06:43,867
It's already gone too far, Sam.

90
00:06:47,003 --> 00:06:48,453
If I didn't know you...

91
00:06:50,914 --> 00:06:52,469
... i would want to hunt you.

92
00:06:56,898 --> 00:06:58,492
And so would other hunters.

93
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,351
You were gone.

94
00:07:04,037 --> 00:07:05,039
I was here.

95
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:09,225
I had to keep on fighting without you.

96
00:07:11,002 --> 00:07:12,299
And what I'm doing...

97
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,822
It works.

98
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:20,230
Well, tell me.

99
00:07:20,582 --> 00:07:22,196
If it's so terrific...

100
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:25,406
Then why'd you lie about it to me?

101
00:07:27,818 --> 00:07:30,828
Why did an angel tell me to stop you?

102
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:34,042
What?

103
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,210
Cas said that if I don't stop you, he will.

104
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,172
See, what that means, Sam --

105
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:45,259
That means that god doesn't
want you doing this.

106
00:07:46,951 --> 00:07:49,639
So, are you just gonna stand there
and tell me that everything is all good?

107
00:07:59,124 --> 00:07:59,941
Hello?

108
00:08:00,922 --> 00:08:03,043
Hey, Travis.
Yeah, hey.

109
00:08:04,806 --> 00:08:06,921
It's good to hear your voice, too.

110
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,707
Um, look, it's not a really
good time right now.

111
00:08:13,436 --> 00:08:16,165
Well, just give me the details,
and...

112
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,154
Carthage, missouri.

113
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,096
Looking for Jack Montgomery.

114
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,738
Jack, are you stoned?

115
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,172
What? It's good.

116
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:48,447
I'm starving.

117
00:08:49,098 --> 00:08:51,762
- Is -- is there dessert?
- It just so happens.

118
00:08:55,898 --> 00:08:56,919
Hey, babe?

119
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:59,041
Are you gonna finish your steak?

120
00:08:59,358 --> 00:09:01,377
You're kidding, right?
You've had two already.

121
00:09:02,356 --> 00:09:04,964
I don't know.
I'm just... hungry.

122
00:09:05,993 --> 00:09:07,586
Or you have tapeworm.

123
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:08,751
Please.

124
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:11,131
I never felt better.

125
00:10:03,654 --> 00:10:04,982
I can't believe it.

126
00:10:05,656 --> 00:10:07,320
Mom... a hunter?

127
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:11,763
I wouldn't have believed it,
either, if I hadn't seen it myself.

128
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:17,119
That woman could kick some ass.
I mean, she almost took me down.

129
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:19,497
How'd she look?

130
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:21,297
I mean...

131
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:22,917
Was she happy?

132
00:10:23,077 --> 00:10:24,412
Yeah, she was awesome.

133
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:26,944
Funny and smart.

134
00:10:28,298 --> 00:10:29,423
So hopeful.

135
00:10:30,335 --> 00:10:31,703
Dad, too.

136
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:33,644
Until, of course...

137
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:39,282
what?

138
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:41,936
Nothing.

139
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:44,543
It's just...

140
00:10:44,663 --> 00:10:46,857
Our parents, and now we find out
our grandparents, too?

141
00:10:47,017 --> 00:10:48,708
Our whole family murdered, and for what?

142
00:10:48,828 --> 00:10:51,779
So yellow eyes could get
in my nursery and bleed in my mouth?

143
00:10:57,986 --> 00:11:00,484
Sam, I never said anything
about demon blood.

144
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:03,508
You knew about that?

145
00:11:03,628 --> 00:11:05,183
Yeah, for about a year.

146
00:11:05,303 --> 00:11:06,419
A whole year.

147
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:08,247
I should have told you.
I'm sorry.

148
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,506
You've been saying
that a lot lately, Sam.

149
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,812
But whatever.

150
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:14,752
You don't want to tell me,
you don't have to.

151
00:11:14,872 --> 00:11:16,262
- It's fine.
- Dean.

152
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:20,922
Whatever.

153
00:11:27,866 --> 00:11:30,318
- Hey, babe, when's dinner?
- 45 minutes.

154
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:35,428
I'm starving!

155
00:11:35,548 --> 00:11:38,159
<i>Jack, a delicious, unmicrowaved,
non-takeout,</i>

156
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:40,182
<i>homemade meal is coming.</i>

157
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,614
Are you sure that's him?

158
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,096
Only Jack Montgomery in town.

159
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:50,212
And we're looking for...?

160
00:11:50,372 --> 00:11:52,355
Travis said to keep an eye out for anything weird.

161
00:11:52,743 --> 00:11:54,243
- Weird?
- Yeah.

162
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,483
All right, well, yeah, I've seen
big weird, little weird,

163
00:11:58,603 --> 00:12:00,056
weird with crazy on top.

164
00:12:00,216 --> 00:12:01,167
But this guy?

165
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:03,606
I mean, come on, this guy's boring.

166
00:12:03,726 --> 00:12:06,271
I don't know, Dean.
Travis seemed pretty sure.

167
00:13:03,013 --> 00:13:04,505
<i>Honey?</i>

168
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,551
I'd say that qualifies as weird.

169
00:13:23,264 --> 00:13:24,402
Travis.

170
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,606
See, Sam. Told you we should
have hid the beer.

171
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:30,831
Smartass.
Get over here!

172
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,220
Ohh, good to see you.

173
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,722
- You too.
- Good to see you.

174
00:13:35,842 --> 00:13:37,365
You too, Travis.

175
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,836
Man, you got tall, kid.

176
00:13:40,857 --> 00:13:42,103
How long has it been?

177
00:13:42,223 --> 00:13:43,809
Oh, got to be 10 years.

178
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,045
You still a -- oh, what was it?

179
00:13:46,341 --> 00:13:47,740
A mathlete?

180
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:50,207
- No.
- Yep, sure is.

181
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:52,391
Been too long, boys.

182
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:53,783
I mean, look at you...

183
00:13:53,903 --> 00:13:55,056
Grown men.

184
00:13:56,093 --> 00:13:58,096
John would have been damn proud of you...

185
00:13:58,216 --> 00:13:59,867
Sticking together like this.

186
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:02,350
Yeah. Yeah, we're as thick as thieves.

187
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,514
Nothing more important than family.

188
00:14:06,066 --> 00:14:07,892
Sorry I'm late for the dance.

189
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,102
Thanks for helping out an old man.

190
00:14:10,262 --> 00:14:12,021
I'm a little, uh, shorthanded.

191
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:16,097
So, you track down Montgomery?

192
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:17,943
Yeah, we found him at his home.

193
00:14:18,103 --> 00:14:18,737
And?

194
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,863
He had a hell of a case
of the munchies, topped off

195
00:14:21,023 --> 00:14:22,659
with a burger that he forgot to cook.

196
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,364
That's him, all right.

197
00:14:24,578 --> 00:14:25,720
What's him?

198
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:28,370
Boys, we got a rougarou on our hands.

199
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:29,968
A rougarou?

200
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,124
Is that made up?
That sounds made up.

201
00:14:32,284 --> 00:14:33,913
They're mean, nasty little suckers --

202
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:36,630
Rotted teeth, wormy skin, the works.

203
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,923
Well, that ain't this guy.

204
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,745
He was wearing a cellphone on his belt.

205
00:14:40,865 --> 00:14:42,696
He'll turn ugly soon enough.

206
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:45,349
They start out human,
for all intents and purposes.

207
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,601
So, what, they go through
some kind of metamorphosis?

208
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,840
Yep, like a maggot turning
into a bull fly.

209
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:01,362
But most of all, they're hungry.

210
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:03,587
Hungry for what?

211
00:15:03,707 --> 00:15:06,017
At first, for everything, but then...

212
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:08,410
For long pig.

213
00:15:09,652 --> 00:15:11,846
- Long pig?
- He means human flesh.

214
00:15:12,816 --> 00:15:14,592
And that is my word of the day.

215
00:15:15,338 --> 00:15:17,802
Hunger grows in till
they can't fight it,

216
00:15:18,111 --> 00:15:20,881
till they got to take themselves a big,
juicy chomp, and then it happens.

217
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:22,216
What happens?

218
00:15:22,376 --> 00:15:24,718
They transform completely and fast.

219
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,752
I think I need stitches.

220
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,140
- I got to go.
- What?

221
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,810
- I got to get out of here.
- Where are you going?

222
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,099
Jack?!

223
00:15:36,098 --> 00:15:37,805
One bite's all it takes --

224
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,375
Eyes, teeth, skin all turns.
No going back, either.

225
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:44,265
They feed once, they're a monster forever.

226
00:15:45,092 --> 00:15:47,461
And our man Jack's headed there on a bullet train.

227
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:49,743
How'd you find this guy
if he's a walking, talking human?

228
00:15:49,903 --> 00:15:51,912
Let's just say it runs in his family.

229
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:54,823
- You mean, uh...
- Killed his daddy back in'78.

230
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:58,132
Son of a bitch mangled eight
bodies before I put him down.

231
00:15:58,693 --> 00:16:00,480
Guy used to be a dentist --

232
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,319
Cadillac, trophy wife.

233
00:16:03,616 --> 00:16:05,924
Little did I know, pregnant trophy wife.

234
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:08,844
She put the boy up for adoption.

235
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:12,398
By the time I found out,
he was long gone, lost in the system.

236
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:14,602
You mean to tell me
you couldn't find someone?

237
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:17,271
I'm not sure I wanted to.

238
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:20,118
The idea of hunting down
some poor kid...

239
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:22,192
I don't think i'd have had the heart.

240
00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:27,778
Wanted to wait,
make damn sure I had the right man.

241
00:16:29,248 --> 00:16:30,545
Apparently, I do.

242
00:16:54,117 --> 00:16:55,475
One more, please.

243
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,246
Can I get some more peanuts?

244
00:17:16,044 --> 00:17:17,253
Come on.

245
00:17:17,373 --> 00:17:18,597
What are you drinking?

246
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:19,996
It's my treat.

247
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:21,426
No, thank you.

248
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:23,086
Oh, don't be like that.

249
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:24,632
Have a drink with me.

250
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:28,004
- I'm waiting for someone.
- Okay, well, where is he?

251
00:17:28,124 --> 00:17:29,540
Hey, douche bag.

252
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,836
She doesn't want to talk to you.

253
00:17:33,492 --> 00:17:35,600
I'm sorry.
I didn't hear you.

254
00:17:37,176 --> 00:17:38,360
I said...

255
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:41,689
She doesn't want to talk to you,
you fat... sweaty... dick.

256
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:42,813
You fat...

257
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:44,611
Sweaty...

258
00:17:45,234 --> 00:17:46,071
Dick.

259
00:17:46,939 --> 00:17:48,153
Now, leave her alone.

260
00:17:48,981 --> 00:17:52,199
You, uh, seriously want to do this, guy?

261
00:17:52,913 --> 00:17:55,786
You know, I really think I do.

262
00:18:10,265 --> 00:18:12,011
So, fire, huh?

263
00:18:12,818 --> 00:18:15,075
The only way I found to kill these bastards --

264
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:16,444
Deep-fry 'em.

265
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:18,895
Well, that's gonna be...

266
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:20,278
Horrible.

267
00:18:20,773 --> 00:18:22,896
Is that what you did to Jack's dad?

268
00:18:27,582 --> 00:18:30,028
- Not wasting any time, are you?
- None to waste.

269
00:18:30,188 --> 00:18:33,574
The guy hulks out,
we won't be finding bodies, just remains.

270
00:18:34,192 --> 00:18:35,979
What if he doesn't hulk out?

271
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,245
I did a little homework.

272
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:40,846
I've been checking out
the lure on rougarous.

273
00:18:40,966 --> 00:18:43,959
What, my 30 years of experience
not good enough for you?

274
00:18:44,568 --> 00:18:45,252
What?

275
00:18:45,412 --> 00:18:48,088
No. No, I-I just wanted to be prepared.

276
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:50,196
I mean, not that you didn't --

277
00:18:50,316 --> 00:18:51,666
Sam loves research.

278
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:52,968
He does.

279
00:18:53,128 --> 00:18:55,721
He keeps it under his
mattress right next to his k-y.

280
00:18:55,841 --> 00:18:57,306
It's a sickness.
It is.

281
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:00,845
Everything you said checked out,
of course, but...

282
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:02,603
I found a couple of interesting stories

283
00:19:02,763 --> 00:19:06,715
about people who have
this rougarou gene or whatever.

284
00:19:07,532 --> 00:19:11,278
See, they start to turn,
but they never take the final step.

285
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:12,544
Really?

286
00:19:12,664 --> 00:19:15,293
See, if they never eat human flesh,
they don't fully transform.

287
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:16,899
So, what --
Go vegan, stay human?

288
00:19:17,019 --> 00:19:20,269
Basically. Or in this case,
eat a lot of raw meat, just...

289
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:21,845
- Not...
- Long pig.

290
00:19:21,965 --> 00:19:22,965
Right.

291
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:27,652
Good on you for the due diligence, Sam.

292
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,339
But those are fairy tales.

293
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:35,042
Fact is, every rougarou I ever saw or heard of...

294
00:19:36,401 --> 00:19:37,514
Took that bite.

295
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:39,975
Okay, well, that doesn't mean that Jack will.

296
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,308
So, what do we do?

297
00:19:41,468 --> 00:19:43,393
Sit and hope and wait for a body count?

298
00:19:43,713 --> 00:19:46,230
No, we talk to him, explain what's happening.

299
00:19:46,407 --> 00:19:48,013
That way, he can fight it.

300
00:19:48,432 --> 00:19:49,361
Fight it?

301
00:19:50,198 --> 00:19:51,610
Are you kidding me?

302
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,738
You ever been really hungry?

303
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,699
I mean, haven't-eaten-in-days hungry?

304
00:19:57,859 --> 00:19:58,601
Yeah.

305
00:19:59,724 --> 00:20:00,817
Right, then.

306
00:20:01,246 --> 00:20:04,331
Somebody slaps a big, juicy sirloin
in front of you, you walking away?

307
00:20:07,027 --> 00:20:08,836
That's what we are to him now --

308
00:20:08,996 --> 00:20:10,459
Meat on legs.

309
00:20:11,685 --> 00:20:13,976
I'm sorry.
I'm sure he's a stand-up guy.

310
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:15,776
But it's pure, base instinct.

311
00:20:16,092 --> 00:20:17,606
Everything in nature's got to eat.

312
00:20:17,726 --> 00:20:19,788
You think he can stop himself
'cause he's nice?

313
00:20:19,908 --> 00:20:20,848
I don't know.

314
00:20:20,968 --> 00:20:24,968
But we're not gonna kill him unless
he does something to get killed for.

315
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:37,764
What's up with your brother?

316
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,327
Don't get me started.

317
00:20:50,469 --> 00:20:51,245
God.

318
00:20:52,562 --> 00:20:53,645
You scared me.

319
00:20:53,931 --> 00:20:55,966
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sneak up on you.

320
00:20:56,845 --> 00:20:57,996
How are you feeling?

321
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:02,556
I'm feeling pissed, Jack.

322
00:21:04,926 --> 00:21:08,028
I had to drive myself to the hospital last night.

323
00:21:08,148 --> 00:21:09,853
I was there until 2:00.

324
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:11,231
I'm so sorry.

325
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:13,191
- What happened?
- I don't know.

326
00:21:13,351 --> 00:21:15,120
I saw your blood,
and I-i...

327
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:18,290
got dizzy, and I just had to get out.

328
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,603
Well, you could have called.
I left you a dozen messages.

329
00:21:20,723 --> 00:21:23,665
I know. My phone died.
I couldn't find a pay phone.

330
00:21:24,308 --> 00:21:25,454
I -- it was a mess.

331
00:21:26,474 --> 00:21:27,649
But I am...

332
00:21:28,629 --> 00:21:29,569
Sorry.

333
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,635
And I promise it won't ever happen again.

334
00:21:37,412 --> 00:21:38,342
Certainly...

335
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:43,096
Not to a wife as stunning as you.

336
00:21:44,489 --> 00:21:45,807
Better not.

337
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,756
I swear, you know.
One little cut.

338
00:21:52,797 --> 00:21:54,830
Blood's never bothered you before.

339
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,406
I've changed.

340
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,416
This doesn't get you off the hook, you know.

341
00:22:05,536 --> 00:22:07,892
No, no. Think -- think diamond.

342
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,665
Think kobe-sized.

343
00:22:18,874 --> 00:22:20,592
What has gotten into you?

344
00:22:21,468 --> 00:22:22,469
I don't know.

345
00:22:24,961 --> 00:22:25,918
Hey, Jack.

346
00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:27,849
Just slow down.

347
00:22:28,536 --> 00:22:29,342
Jack.

348
00:22:29,752 --> 00:22:31,323
Jack, I mean it.
Stop.

349
00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:33,438
Jack. Ow!

350
00:22:33,815 --> 00:22:34,567
Jack!

351
00:22:35,003 --> 00:22:35,674
Stop!

352
00:22:35,794 --> 00:22:37,609
Stop it!
Stop it!

353
00:22:39,788 --> 00:22:41,154
You son of bitch.

354
00:22:41,573 --> 00:22:42,675
I'm sorry.

355
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,126
What the hell is wrong with you?

356
00:22:47,548 --> 00:22:48,664
I don't know.

357
00:22:50,531 --> 00:22:51,456
I don't know.

358
00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:59,051
So we're gonna go have a little
chat with this guy, which, you know,

359
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,254
I'm down.

360
00:23:01,183 --> 00:23:04,287
But I just want to make sure,
if push comes, you're gonna shove.

361
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:07,230
Meaning?

362
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,986
Well, odds are we're gonna
have to burn this guy alive.

363
00:23:10,106 --> 00:23:12,545
This guy has a name and a wife.

364
00:23:12,665 --> 00:23:14,359
Who we're probably
gonna make a widow?

365
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:16,483
You heard Travis.
He's gonna turn.

366
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,481
- They always turn.
- Well, maybe he won't.

367
00:23:18,726 --> 00:23:20,171
Maybe he can fight it off.

368
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:22,070
And maybe he can't.
That's all I'm saying.

369
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,052
- We'll just have to see, then, okay?
- This is what I mean, Sam.

370
00:23:25,944 --> 00:23:28,732
You sure your emotions
aren't getting in the way here?

371
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:30,989
What are you talking about?

372
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:35,921
You know, nice dude,
but he's got something evil inside.

373
00:23:36,453 --> 00:23:38,837
Something in his blood.
Maybe you can relate.

374
00:23:40,977 --> 00:23:42,482
- Stop the car.
- What?

375
00:23:42,602 --> 00:23:44,573
Stop the car or i will.

376
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:57,421
You want to know
why I've been lying to you?

377
00:23:57,541 --> 00:23:59,274
- Because of crap like this!
- Like what?

378
00:23:59,434 --> 00:24:02,360
The way you talk to me,
the way you look at me like I'm a freak!

379
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,424
- I do not.
- Or even worse, like I'm an idiot!

380
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:07,706
Like I don't know the difference
between right and wrong!

381
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:13,163
- What?
- Do you know the difference, Sam?

382
00:24:13,323 --> 00:24:15,486
I mean, you've been kind
of strolling a dark road lately.

383
00:24:15,606 --> 00:24:17,475
You have no idea
what I'm going through. None.

384
00:24:17,595 --> 00:24:20,545
- Then enlighten me!
- I've got demon blood in me!

385
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,340
This disease pumping through my veins,

386
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,134
and I can't ever rip it out
or scrub it clean!

387
00:24:26,524 --> 00:24:28,516
I'm a whole new level of freak!

388
00:24:31,447 --> 00:24:33,204
And I'm just trying to take this...

389
00:24:33,827 --> 00:24:35,124
This curse...

390
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:37,952
And make something good out of it.

391
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:41,691
Because I have to.

392
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,871
Let's just go talk to the guy.

393
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,315
I mean Jack.

394
00:24:57,489 --> 00:24:58,208
Okay?

395
00:25:10,082 --> 00:25:11,420
Jack Montgomery?

396
00:25:13,591 --> 00:25:16,224
I'm Sam Winchester.
This is my brother, Dean.

397
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,684
We need to talk.

398
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:24,818
About?

399
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:27,413
About you.

400
00:25:28,243 --> 00:25:29,531
About how you're changing.

401
00:25:31,236 --> 00:25:32,293
Excuse me?

402
00:25:32,413 --> 00:25:35,203
You're probably feeling
your bones move under your skin...

403
00:25:35,363 --> 00:25:38,602
And your appetite's reaching,
you know, hungry hungry hippo levels.

404
00:25:38,722 --> 00:25:39,944
How am I doing so far?

405
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:44,629
Who the hell are you guys?

406
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:47,066
We're people who know a
little something about something.

407
00:25:47,186 --> 00:25:48,823
We're people who can help.

408
00:25:49,844 --> 00:25:51,284
Please, just hear us out.

409
00:25:54,349 --> 00:25:55,809
A-a what?

410
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:56,850
A rougarou.

411
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:00,170
Sounds made-up, I know,
but, believe me, it's not.

412
00:26:00,885 --> 00:26:03,481
All right, I've noticed certain things.

413
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:07,793
Some strange things, but I just...
I don't know. I'm...

414
00:26:07,913 --> 00:26:09,196
I'm sick or something.

415
00:26:09,891 --> 00:26:11,448
Your father was one of these things.

416
00:26:14,629 --> 00:26:15,788
Your real father.

417
00:26:16,396 --> 00:26:17,704
He passed it on to you.

418
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:21,942
No.

419
00:26:22,062 --> 00:26:23,649
Are you guys listening to yourselves?

420
00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:25,587
- You sound like you're...
- Skip the whole

421
00:26:25,747 --> 00:26:28,191
"you guys sound crazy," shall we?
You're hungry, Jack.

422
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:30,885
You're only gonna get hungrier.

423
00:26:31,226 --> 00:26:32,997
- Hungrier for?
- Long pig.

424
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:37,682
You know, a little manburger helper
may have crossed your mind already.

425
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:40,923
No.

426
00:26:41,043 --> 00:26:43,396
It doesn't have to be like this, Jack.
You can fight it off.

427
00:26:43,556 --> 00:26:44,482
Others have.

428
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,854
We're not gonna lie to you, though.
It's not gonna be easy.

429
00:26:46,974 --> 00:26:49,420
You're gonna feel like an
alcoholic swimming around in whiskey.

430
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,604
But I'm telling you,
you got to say no,

431
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,450
- Or...
- Or what?

432
00:26:56,104 --> 00:26:57,898
You feed once, and it's all over.

433
00:26:59,472 --> 00:27:01,279
And then we'll have to stop you.

434
00:27:04,282 --> 00:27:05,288
Stop me?

435
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:10,001
My dad...
Did, uh, somebody stop him?

436
00:27:11,911 --> 00:27:12,691
Yes.

437
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,894
Get off my property right now.

438
00:27:17,014 --> 00:27:18,857
I see you guys again,
I'm calling the cops.

439
00:27:18,977 --> 00:27:21,393
Jack, your wife,
everybody you know, they're in danger.

440
00:27:21,553 --> 00:27:22,269
Now!

441
00:27:29,998 --> 00:27:31,121
Good talk.

442
00:27:42,835 --> 00:27:45,170
Jack, I don't know where you are,
but you're scaring me.

443
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,297
Come home.

444
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:47,584
We need to talk.

445
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:49,290
Please?

446
00:28:27,821 --> 00:28:29,706
Damn it, Jack, no!

447
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,499
Come on.

448
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:16,883
Wait!

449
00:29:17,043 --> 00:29:19,109
We're here to save you, I guess.

450
00:29:19,229 --> 00:29:21,425
- I'm calling the police.
- We should go.

451
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,296
Michelle, I'm home.

452
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:43,360
Hey, babe?

453
00:29:44,609 --> 00:29:45,671
Are you here?

454
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:50,073
Michelle.

455
00:30:08,915 --> 00:30:09,911
Michelle?

456
00:30:11,382 --> 00:30:13,139
Okay.
We're gonna stay calm.

457
00:30:14,262 --> 00:30:16,794
We're gonna give this man
whatever he wants.

458
00:30:17,395 --> 00:30:18,473
Anything.

459
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,528
Just take it and go, please.

460
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:22,259
I'm sorry about this, Jack.

461
00:30:23,413 --> 00:30:24,600
I truly am.

462
00:30:25,903 --> 00:30:27,968
It's not the way that I wanted it to go.

463
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:29,775
Who are you?

464
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,391
You already met some friends of mine.

465
00:30:34,698 --> 00:30:35,872
Two brothers?

466
00:30:36,781 --> 00:30:38,252
They said that if I...

467
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,302
Look, I haven't hurt anybody.

468
00:30:43,661 --> 00:30:45,430
Not yet, but you would've.

469
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:47,140
They always do.

470
00:30:47,974 --> 00:30:50,602
- I'm doing you a favor, son.
- Jack, what's he talking about?

471
00:30:53,358 --> 00:30:54,512
Tell her, Jack.

472
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:57,748
Tell her the truth.
She deserves to know.

473
00:31:00,802 --> 00:31:01,935
Just let her go.

474
00:31:02,055 --> 00:31:03,656
She's not a part of this.

475
00:31:03,927 --> 00:31:05,193
A part of what?

476
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:08,351
Jack?!

477
00:31:09,003 --> 00:31:12,790
I really do apologize,
but she is part of it.

478
00:31:14,233 --> 00:31:15,351
What?

479
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:17,540
Michelle...

480
00:31:18,584 --> 00:31:20,632
Tell him what you told me
when I got here.

481
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:25,038
Michelle?

482
00:31:30,606 --> 00:31:31,601
I said...

483
00:31:32,781 --> 00:31:34,007
"don't hurt me...

484
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:38,245
Because I'm pregnant."

485
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:46,449
J-just hold on a minute.

486
00:31:46,609 --> 00:31:48,335
Now you see the mess we're in?

487
00:31:48,571 --> 00:31:50,889
I can't make this mistake all over again.

488
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:54,082
I won't be around in 30 years.
This has got to end now.

489
00:31:55,702 --> 00:31:59,984
I know you don't believe me, but I'd
give anything not to have to do this.

490
00:32:00,104 --> 00:32:01,516
No. No.

491
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:03,416
No. No.

492
00:32:08,931 --> 00:32:10,223
Oh, god.
Please don't!

493
00:32:10,383 --> 00:32:11,752
You don't have to do this!

494
00:32:11,872 --> 00:32:14,727
If you want to kill me, kill me,
but not my wife.

495
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,826
Okay?

496
00:32:16,305 --> 00:32:18,340
- I'm begging you.
- Ain't got no choice.

497
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,193
My condolences.

498
00:32:26,357 --> 00:32:27,198
Jack.

499
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,471
Jack!

500
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,379
Stay away from me!

501
00:33:43,706 --> 00:33:44,799
Michelle.

502
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,420
I guess now we know where Travis is.

503
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,040
That stupid son of a bitch.

504
00:35:09,074 --> 00:35:09,986
Oh, god.

505
00:35:11,494 --> 00:35:12,709
Think that's Travis?

506
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,785
What's left of him.

507
00:35:18,918 --> 00:35:20,522
Guess you were right about Jack.

508
00:35:22,728 --> 00:35:23,416
Dean!

509
00:35:48,504 --> 00:35:49,301
Dean?

510
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,519
Dean can't come to the phone right now.

511
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:56,146
Jack! If you hurt him, I swear to god!

512
00:35:56,266 --> 00:35:57,348
Calm down!

513
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:00,703
Your brother's alive.

514
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,207
But not if you don't calm down!

515
00:36:05,008 --> 00:36:06,408
All right, Jack.

516
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,145
Listen.

517
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:10,800
Open the door.
We can figure this out, okay?

518
00:36:11,331 --> 00:36:14,374
We'll have ourselves a
little brainstorming session.

519
00:36:14,494 --> 00:36:15,914
Jack, please.

520
00:36:16,034 --> 00:36:17,306
I don't think so.

521
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,263
After what you did?

522
00:36:19,573 --> 00:36:20,602
What?

523
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:22,222
What are you talking about?

524
00:36:22,841 --> 00:36:24,536
You sent your friend here.

525
00:36:25,343 --> 00:36:27,978
He tried to burn my wife alive!

526
00:36:29,347 --> 00:36:31,011
What? Why?

527
00:36:37,284 --> 00:36:38,651
He didn't say.

528
00:36:42,196 --> 00:36:45,565
I guess psychopaths don't
have to explain themselves.

529
00:36:47,742 --> 00:36:48,782
Listen to me.

530
00:36:49,008 --> 00:36:50,290
You got to believe me.

531
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,012
My brother and i,
we never would have hurt her, okay?

532
00:37:04,092 --> 00:37:05,665
Oh, god, I'm so hungry.

533
00:37:05,785 --> 00:37:07,395
Jack, don't do this.

534
00:37:09,095 --> 00:37:11,394
I can't ever see my family again.

535
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,613
You two...

536
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,726
Your friend...
You made me into this!

537
00:37:19,961 --> 00:37:21,717
No one's making you kill us.

538
00:37:25,457 --> 00:37:26,535
Listen to me.

539
00:37:26,655 --> 00:37:28,833
You got this dark pit inside you. I know.

540
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:30,543
Believe me, I know.

541
00:37:30,972 --> 00:37:33,546
But that doesn't mean you have to fall into it.

542
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,172
You don't have to be a monster.

543
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,376
Have you seen me lately?

544
00:37:39,496 --> 00:37:41,228
It doesn't matter what you are.

545
00:37:41,348 --> 00:37:42,805
It only matters what you do.

546
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,547
It's your choice.

547
00:38:09,893 --> 00:38:10,833
Jack!

548
00:38:53,755 --> 00:38:55,492
You did the right thing, you know.

549
00:38:56,687 --> 00:38:58,919
That guy was a monster.
There was no going back.

550
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,570
Sam, I want to tell you i'm sorry.

551
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:09,600
- I've been kind of hard on you lately.
- Don't worry about it.

552
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:16,215
It's just that your, uh --
Your psychic thing --

553
00:39:16,335 --> 00:39:18,734
- It scares the crap out of me.
- If it's all the Same,

554
00:39:18,894 --> 00:39:20,760
I'd really rather not talk about it.

555
00:39:22,435 --> 00:39:24,028
Wait a minute. What?

556
00:39:24,148 --> 00:39:26,089
You don't want to talk? You?

557
00:39:26,209 --> 00:39:27,764
There's nothing more to say.

558
00:39:27,884 --> 00:39:29,533
I can't keep explaining myself to you.

559
00:39:29,653 --> 00:39:31,643
- I can't make you understand.
- Why don't you try?

560
00:39:31,763 --> 00:39:32,815
I can't.

561
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,688
Because th thing, this blood...

562
00:39:35,808 --> 00:39:38,136
It's not in you the way it's in me.

563
00:39:39,206 --> 00:39:41,090
It's just something I got to deal with.

564
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,093
Not alone.

565
00:39:51,627 --> 00:39:53,139
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

566
00:39:54,211 --> 00:39:55,444
These powers --

567
00:39:57,306 --> 00:39:58,623
It's playing with fire.

568
00:40:00,697 --> 00:40:01,777
I'm done with them.

569
00:40:03,731 --> 00:40:04,947
I'm done with everything.

570
00:40:06,314 --> 00:40:07,256
Really?

571
00:40:09,388 --> 00:40:10,777
Well, that's a relief.

572
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:12,133
Thank you.

573
00:40:12,585 --> 00:40:14,489
Don't thank me.
I'm not doing it for you.

574
00:40:15,245 --> 00:40:17,563
Or for the angels or for anybody.

575
00:40:19,739 --> 00:40:21,189
This is my choice.
