1
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:05,171
- Meg.
- Hi.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,299
- You were hunting with Jo?
- For a while now.

3
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:11,170
The mooks have melted down
the gun by now.

4
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:12,345
I hear differently.

5
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:16,224
And if you are still set
on the insane task of killing the devil,

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,568
this is how we do it.

7
00:00:17,693 --> 00:00:20,050
In chapter 33 of "Supernatural",
there was that girl Bela.

8
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:22,158
She stole The Colt from you,
and then she "said"

9
00:00:22,283 --> 00:00:23,660
she gave it to Lilith, rember?

10
00:00:23,785 --> 00:00:25,111
You know she lied, right?

11
00:00:25,236 --> 00:00:27,060
- She never really gave it to Lilith.
- What?

12
00:00:27,185 --> 00:00:29,028
Bela gives The Colt
to a demon named Crowley.

13
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,067
Crowley?

14
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,802
Mr. Pendleton, I presume.

15
00:00:59,532 --> 00:01:00,913
The name's Crowley.

16
00:01:02,505 --> 00:01:06,941
In my negotiations, I was dealing
with a very young attractive lady.

17
00:01:07,295 --> 00:01:08,901
Yes. I know.

18
00:01:09,513 --> 00:01:11,983
But you, piggy banker...

19
00:01:12,108 --> 00:01:14,382
You... are a big fish.

20
00:01:15,513 --> 00:01:18,805
And I wanted to do you the honor
of sealing this deal personally.

21
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:21,586
But she said the deal
would be sealed with a kiss.

22
00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:22,707
That's right.

23
00:01:25,915 --> 00:01:27,085
No, I mean, she's...

24
00:01:27,456 --> 00:01:28,475
Your choice.

25
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,116
You can cling to six decades
of deep-seated homophobia

26
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:34,757
or just give it up.

27
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,959
And get a complete bailout
of your bank's ridiculous incompetence.

28
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,932
- There are just things...
- Going once.

29
00:01:44,057 --> 00:01:46,066
- No, I don't think so.
- Going twice.

30
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:47,500
All right!

31
00:02:03,655 --> 00:02:04,457
Got him.

32
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,450
= 510 =

33
00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:10,546
= Supernatural Team =

34
00:02:16,277 --> 00:02:18,387
The demon Crowley is making a deal.

35
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,688
Even as we speak, it's...

36
00:02:21,645 --> 00:02:23,476
Going... down.

37
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:26,001
"Going down"?

38
00:02:26,882 --> 00:02:28,764
Right.
Okay, huggy bear.

39
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:30,902
- Just don't lose him.
- I won't lose him.

40
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,146
Damn you.

41
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,271
Enjoy the obscene wealth.
See you in 10 years.

42
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:59,720
I followed him.
It's not far, but...

43
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:05,075
... it's layered
in enochian warding magic.

44
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:08,887
I can't get in.

45
00:03:09,012 --> 00:03:11,190
That's okay. You did great.
We'll take it from here.

46
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:51,554
Hello? My car broke down.
I need some help.

47
00:03:51,977 --> 00:03:53,725
We'll be down in a minute.

48
00:04:09,603 --> 00:04:10,916
Evening, pretty lady.

49
00:04:12,195 --> 00:04:15,419
- Get yourself on in here.
- I just need to make a call.

50
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,042
You don't need to call anyone, baby.

51
00:04:19,266 --> 00:04:21,135
We're the only help
you're ever gonna need.

52
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:23,516
You know what?

53
00:04:24,082 --> 00:04:25,639
I think I should wait by my car.

54
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:30,269
We said get your ass in here.

55
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:41,864
- Nice work, Jo.
- Thanks.

56
00:04:44,046 --> 00:04:45,618
Okay. Shall we?

57
00:04:58,113 --> 00:04:59,507
It's "Crowley," right?

58
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:03,844
So...
the hardy boys finally found me.

59
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:05,942
Took you long enough.

60
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:26,825
Do you have any idea
how much this rug costs?

61
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,945
This is it, right?

62
00:05:35,395 --> 00:05:37,013
This is what it's all about.

63
00:05:51,203 --> 00:05:52,427
We need to talk.

64
00:05:53,374 --> 00:05:54,311
Privately.

65
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:00,809
What the hell is this?

66
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:03,092
Do you know how deep
I could have buried this thing?

67
00:06:03,934 --> 00:06:07,763
There's no reason you or anyone
should know this even exists at all.

68
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,369
Except that I told you.

69
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:13,750
- You told us?
- Rumors, innuendo...

70
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,322
- Sent out on the grapevine.
- Why?

71
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,730
Why tell us anything?

72
00:06:21,677 --> 00:06:27,144
I want you to take this thing to Lucifer
and empty it into his face.

73
00:06:30,697 --> 00:06:34,093
And why exactly would you
want the devil dead?

74
00:06:34,565 --> 00:06:36,381
It's called...

75
00:06:36,907 --> 00:06:38,131
Survival.

76
00:06:39,763 --> 00:06:42,737
But I forgot... you two,
at best, are functional morons.

77
00:06:43,026 --> 00:06:44,953
Yeah, you're functioning... morons.

78
00:06:45,078 --> 00:06:46,078
Mor...

79
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:50,297
Lucifer isn't a demon, remember?

80
00:06:50,692 --> 00:06:55,040
He's an angel...
famous for his hatred of humankind.

81
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,297
To him, you're just...
filthy bags of pus.

82
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:01,264
If that's the way
he feels about you...

83
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,590
... what can he think aboutus?

84
00:07:06,297 --> 00:07:07,478
But he created you.

85
00:07:08,008 --> 00:07:09,851
To him, we're just servants.

86
00:07:10,508 --> 00:07:11,658
Cannon fodder.

87
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:15,893
If Lucifer manages
to exterminate humankind...

88
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:19,438
... we're next.

89
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:21,734
So...

90
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:24,024
Help me.

91
00:07:25,603 --> 00:07:28,030
Let's all go back
to simpler, better times.

92
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,178
Back to... when we could
all follow our natures.

93
00:07:31,303 --> 00:07:33,202
I'm in sales, damn it.

94
00:07:33,856 --> 00:07:35,323
So, what do you say?

95
00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:36,579
What if...

96
00:07:37,242 --> 00:07:38,864
I give you this thing...

97
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:40,961
And you go kill the devil?

98
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:51,237
Great.

99
00:07:55,437 --> 00:07:57,328
You wouldn't happen
to know where the devil is,

100
00:07:57,453 --> 00:07:58,722
by chance, would you?

101
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,766
Thursday.
Birdies tell me...

102
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,753
He has an appointment
in Carthage, Missouri.

103
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:09,615
Great.

104
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:11,657
Thanks.

105
00:08:20,247 --> 00:08:23,668
Right. You probably need
some more ammunition.

106
00:08:25,944 --> 00:08:27,221
Excuse me for asking,

107
00:08:27,346 --> 00:08:29,550
but aren't you kind of signing
your own death warrant?

108
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:35,046
What happens to you if we go up
against the devil and lose?

109
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:37,520
Number one...
He's gonna wipe us all out anyway.

110
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:39,560
Two...
After you leave here,

111
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,283
I go on an extended vacation
to all points nowhere.

112
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:44,606
And three...
How about you don't miss?!

113
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,026
Morons!

114
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:04,001
All right, big boy.

115
00:09:17,846 --> 00:09:19,787
I think
I'm starting to feel something.

116
00:09:21,613 --> 00:09:23,353
It's got to be a trap, right?

117
00:09:25,054 --> 00:09:27,691
Sam winchester having trust issues
with a demon.

118
00:09:28,238 --> 00:09:29,725
Better late than never.

119
00:09:30,396 --> 00:09:32,821
Yeah, and thank you again
for your continued support.

120
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,462
You're welcome.

121
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:40,271
And, you know, trap or no trap,

122
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:42,831
we got a snowball's chance,
we got to take it, right?

123
00:09:44,607 --> 00:09:46,160
Yeah, I suppose.

124
00:09:47,107 --> 00:09:48,921
Besides, I'm not sure it is a trap.

125
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,093
Check it out.

126
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:54,432
Carthage is lit up like a christmas tree
with revelation omens.

127
00:09:55,104 --> 00:09:56,709
And look at this.

128
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:01,767
There's been six missing
persons reported in town since sunday.

129
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:05,682
I think the devil's there.

130
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:10,955
Look, when you think about it...

131
00:10:12,455 --> 00:10:13,770
... you can't come with.

132
00:10:14,086 --> 00:10:14,974
Dean...

133
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:17,757
Look, I go against Satan
and screw the pooch...

134
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,954
We've lost a game piece.
That, we can take.

135
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:24,191
But if you're there...

136
00:10:24,316 --> 00:10:28,052
Then we are handing
the devil's vessel right over to him.

137
00:10:28,177 --> 00:10:30,990
- That's not smart. - Since when have we
ever done anything smart?

138
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:32,927
- I'm serious, Sam.
- So am i.

139
00:10:33,815 --> 00:10:35,510
Haven't we learned a damn thing?

140
00:10:35,947 --> 00:10:39,096
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it together.

141
00:10:50,397 --> 00:10:52,160
That's a stupid friggin' idea.

142
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:02,953
Boy. Talk about stupid ideas.

143
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:04,190
Good god.

144
00:11:05,642 --> 00:11:06,999
True, that.

145
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:17,791
So...

146
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:21,452
Dangerous mission tomorrow.

147
00:11:23,118 --> 00:11:24,473
Guess it's time to...

148
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:26,243
Eat, drink, and...

149
00:11:26,368 --> 00:11:27,463
You know...

150
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:29,293
Make merry.

151
00:11:31,293 --> 00:11:33,736
Are you giving me
the "last night on earth" speech?

152
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,110
- What?
- What?

153
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:41,656
If i was, would that work?

154
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:55,666
No.

155
00:11:56,705 --> 00:11:58,626
Sweetheart, if this is
our last night on earth,

156
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,087
then I'm going to spend it

157
00:12:00,212 --> 00:12:02,482
with a little thing
I call "self-respect".

158
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:09,672
- If you're into that kind of thing.
- Everybody, get in here!

159
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:11,833
It's time for the lineup.

160
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,583
Usual suspects, in the corner.

161
00:12:15,044 --> 00:12:17,610
Come on, Bobby.
Nobody wants their picture taken.

162
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:18,820
Hear, hear.

163
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:20,947
Shut up.
You're drinkin'my beer.

164
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:23,526
Anyway...

165
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:28,145
I'm gonna need something
to rember your sorry asses by.

166
00:12:29,526 --> 00:12:31,842
Always good to have
an optimist around.

167
00:12:32,382 --> 00:12:33,483
Bobby's right.

168
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,045
Tomorrow we hunt the devil.

169
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:37,895
This is our last night on earth.

170
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:56,667


171
00:13:12,736 --> 00:13:14,052
You getting a signal?

172
00:13:14,852 --> 00:13:16,026
No, nothin'.

173
00:13:16,858 --> 00:13:17,974
Nice and spooky.

174
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:30,801
- Place seem a little empty to you?
- We're gonna go check out the PD.

175
00:13:30,926 --> 00:13:32,932
You guys stay here...
See if you can find anybody.

176
00:13:47,238 --> 00:13:49,673
- Ever heard of a door handle?
- Of course I have.

177
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,169
- What is it, cass?
- This town's not empty.

178
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,949
Reapers.

179
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,706
- "Reapers"?
- As in more than one?

180
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,636
They only gather like this
at times of great catastrophe...

181
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:14,896
Chicago fire, san francisco quake...

182
00:14:15,747 --> 00:14:16,756
Pompeii.

183
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,985
Excuse me.
I need to find out why they're here.

184
00:15:10,616 --> 00:15:11,985
Hello, brother.

185
00:15:16,853 --> 00:15:19,025
- Station's empty.
- So is everything else.

186
00:15:19,327 --> 00:15:21,064
- Have you seen cass?
- What?

187
00:15:21,327 --> 00:15:22,288
He was with you.

188
00:15:22,413 --> 00:15:24,022
Nope. He went after the reapers.

189
00:15:24,147 --> 00:15:25,771
- Reapers?
- He saw reapers?

190
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:27,135
Where?

191
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,250
Well, kind of... everywhere.

192
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:48,904
Lucifer.

193
00:15:51,398 --> 00:15:53,890
So, I take it you're here
with the Winchesters.

194
00:15:56,657 --> 00:15:57,706
I came alone.

195
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,339
Loyalty.

196
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,379
Such a nice quality to see
in this day and age.

197
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,799
Castiel, right?

198
00:16:10,773 --> 00:16:12,070
Castiel...

199
00:16:12,628 --> 00:16:15,265
I'm told you came here
in an automobile.

200
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:18,936
Yes.

201
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:20,608
What was that like?

202
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,023
Slow.

203
00:16:25,297 --> 00:16:26,297
Confing.

204
00:16:26,858 --> 00:16:28,612
What a peculiar thing you are.

205
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:33,786
What's wrong with your vessel?

206
00:16:34,971 --> 00:16:35,971
Yes, um...

207
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:39,748
Nick is wearing a bit thin,
i'm afraid.

208
00:16:40,552 --> 00:16:42,250
He can't contain me forever, so...

209
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,513
You...

210
00:16:49,446 --> 00:16:51,301
You are not taking Sam Winchester.

211
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:55,597
- I won't let you.
- Castiel.

212
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,830
I don't understand why you're
fighting me, of all the angels.

213
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:03,593
You really have to ask?

214
00:17:03,883 --> 00:17:05,594
I rebelled.
I was cast out.

215
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:07,765
You rebelled.
You were cast out.

216
00:17:08,817 --> 00:17:10,914
Almost all of heaven wants
to see me dead.

217
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,133
And if they succeed, guess what.

218
00:17:15,094 --> 00:17:17,344
You're
their new public enemy number one.

219
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:21,857
We're on the same side,
like it or not, so...

220
00:17:22,963 --> 00:17:25,042
Why not just serve
your own best interests?

221
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:27,379
Which, in this case,
just happen to be mine.

222
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:30,884
I'll die first.

223
00:17:36,899 --> 00:17:38,451
I suppose you will.

224
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:47,977
This is great.
We've been in town for 20 minutes.

225
00:17:48,102 --> 00:17:50,060
We've already lost
the angel up our sleeve.

226
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:52,655
You think...
You think Lucifer got him?

227
00:17:53,112 --> 00:17:54,614
I don't know what else to think.

228
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,958
There you are.

229
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:00,912
Meg!

230
00:18:02,932 --> 00:18:04,537
You shouldn't have come here, boys.

231
00:18:04,662 --> 00:18:07,000
Yeah?
I could say the same thing for you.

232
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:09,813
Didn't come here alone, Dean.

233
00:18:19,553 --> 00:18:21,112
- Hellhounds!
- Yeah, Dean...

234
00:18:21,237 --> 00:18:22,421
Your favorite.

235
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,394
Come on, boys.

236
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,146
My father wants to see you.

237
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,851
- I think we'll pass.
- Thanks.

238
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:28,773
Your call.

239
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:32,626
You can make this easy,
or you can make it really, really hard.

240
00:18:38,182 --> 00:18:40,827
When have you known us
to ever make anything easy?

241
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:44,777
Run!

242
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,381
Jo, stay back!

243
00:19:29,576 --> 00:19:31,496
Boys, need some help here!

244
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,662


245
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:10,895
It'll be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

246
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,020
Thank you.

247
00:20:14,569 --> 00:20:15,784
How's she holding up?

248
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,014
- The salt lines are holding up.
- Safe for now.

249
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,257
Safe or trapped like rats.

250
00:20:28,992 --> 00:20:30,192
You heard Meg.

251
00:20:31,002 --> 00:20:32,402
Her father's here.

252
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:36,247
This is our one shot, Sammy.
We got to take it.

253
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:43,127
- There we go.
- Sam, some help here, please.

254
00:20:44,631 --> 00:20:46,730
The number you dialed is unavailable.
Please...

255
00:20:46,855 --> 00:20:48,055
Damn it, boys.

256
00:21:01,613 --> 00:21:04,112
KC5 Fox Delta Oscar, go ahead.

257
00:21:05,317 --> 00:21:07,348
Bobby, it's Dean.
We got problems.

258
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,604
It's okay, that's why I'm here.

259
00:21:13,256 --> 00:21:14,856
Is everyone all right?

260
00:21:19,189 --> 00:21:20,939
It's Jo. It's pretty bad.

261
00:21:24,902 --> 00:21:26,202
Okay. Copy that.

262
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,037
Now we figure what we do next.

263
00:21:31,335 --> 00:21:32,935
I don't think she's...

264
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,805
I said, "what do we do next?", Dean.

265
00:21:47,831 --> 00:21:48,831
Right.

266
00:21:49,238 --> 00:21:50,338
Okay, right.

267
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,533
Now...
Tell me what you got.

268
00:21:56,645 --> 00:21:59,286
Before he went missing,
did Cass say how many reapers?

269
00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:01,988
I don't know.
He said a lot of things, I guess.

270
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:05,213
- Does the number matter?
- Devil's in the details.

271
00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:09,494
Bobby, it's Ellen.

272
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:12,997
The way he was looking,
the number of places his eyes went,

273
00:22:13,304 --> 00:22:15,667
I'd say
over a dozen reapers, probably more.

274
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:21,881
- I do not like the sound of that.
- Nobody does.

275
00:22:24,337 --> 00:22:25,843
What does that sound like?

276
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:28,179
It sounds like Death, son.

277
00:22:28,971 --> 00:22:31,099
I think Satan's in town
to work a ritual.

278
00:22:32,554 --> 00:22:35,054
I think he's planning
to unleash Death.

279
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:40,024
As in this dude
and taxes are the only sure thing?

280
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:41,641
As in Death.

281
00:22:41,942 --> 00:22:44,696
The horseman,
the pale rider in the flesh.

282
00:22:46,004 --> 00:22:48,662
Unleash? Hasn't Death been
tromping all over the place?

283
00:22:48,787 --> 00:22:50,201
I've died several times!

284
00:22:51,031 --> 00:22:53,917
Not this guy.
This is the angel of death,

285
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,331
big daddy reaper.

286
00:22:55,813 --> 00:22:58,418
They keep this guy chained in a box
600 feet under.

287
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,797
Last time they hauled him up,
Noah was building a boat.

288
00:23:03,864 --> 00:23:05,941
That's why the place
is crawling with reapers.

289
00:23:06,881 --> 00:23:09,008
They're waiting
on the big boss to show.

290
00:23:14,652 --> 00:23:16,152
Any other good news?

291
00:23:17,518 --> 00:23:18,813
In a manner of speaking.

292
00:23:20,036 --> 00:23:23,286
I've been researching Carthage
since you've been gone,

293
00:23:23,513 --> 00:23:26,007
trying to suss out
what the devil might want there.

294
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:28,865
What you just said drops the last piece
of the puzzle in place.

295
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:32,283
The angel of death
must be brought into this world

296
00:23:32,408 --> 00:23:35,538
at midnight
through a place of awful carnage.

297
00:23:35,992 --> 00:23:38,916
During the civil war,
there was a battle in Carthage.

298
00:23:39,326 --> 00:23:42,712
So intense the soldiers
called it "the battle of hellhole."

299
00:23:44,368 --> 00:23:45,590
Where'd it go down?

300
00:23:46,698 --> 00:23:49,333
On the land
of William Jasper's farm.

301
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:00,693
I got the Winchesters pinned down.

302
00:24:00,818 --> 00:24:01,818
For now.

303
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:03,833
What should I do?

304
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:07,707
Leave them alone.

305
00:24:08,493 --> 00:24:09,697
Are you sure?

306
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,958
- Shouldn't we...
- Trust me, child.

307
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:15,328
Everything happens for a reason.

308
00:24:20,223 --> 00:24:21,523
Well, Castiel...

309
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,009
You have some time.

310
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,548
To change your mind.

311
00:24:34,146 --> 00:24:36,390
We know where the devil's gonna be,
we know when,

312
00:24:36,872 --> 00:24:38,422
and we have the Colt.

313
00:24:39,537 --> 00:24:41,055
We just have to get past...

314
00:24:41,575 --> 00:24:44,335
Eight or so hellhounds
and get to the farm by midnight.

315
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,910
After we get Jo and Ellen
out of town.

316
00:24:49,181 --> 00:24:50,738
- Won't be easy.
- Stretcher?

317
00:24:51,735 --> 00:24:52,975
I'll see what we got.

318
00:24:54,074 --> 00:24:55,074
Stop.

319
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,078
Guys, stop.

320
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:03,292
Can we be realistic
about this, please?

321
00:25:11,357 --> 00:25:12,907
I can't move my legs.

322
00:25:13,895 --> 00:25:14,971
I can't be moved.

323
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,038
My guts are being held in
by an ace bandage.

324
00:25:20,321 --> 00:25:21,421
We got to...

325
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:24,722
We got to get our priorities
straight here.

326
00:25:29,226 --> 00:25:31,154
Number one, I'm not going anywhere.

327
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,574
- Joanna Beth, stop talking like that...
- Mom.

328
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,235
I can't fight.

329
00:25:38,105 --> 00:25:39,255
I can't walk.

330
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:42,269
But I can do something.

331
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:44,542
We've got propane,

332
00:25:45,281 --> 00:25:46,681
wiring, rock salt,

333
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:48,838
iron nails, everything.

334
00:25:51,023 --> 00:25:52,967
- Everything?
- To build a bomb, Sam.

335
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,972
Jo... no.

336
00:25:58,391 --> 00:25:59,682
You got another plan?

337
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:02,628
You got any other plan?

338
00:26:05,085 --> 00:26:06,856
Those are hellhounds out there.

339
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:12,695
They've got our scents.

340
00:26:14,136 --> 00:26:15,695
Those bitches will never

341
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,420
stop coming after you.

342
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:26,542
We let the dogs in,
you guys hit the roof,

343
00:26:27,446 --> 00:26:29,283
make a break
for the building next over,

344
00:26:29,408 --> 00:26:31,756
and I can wait here
with my finger on the button.

345
00:26:32,828 --> 00:26:34,628
Rip those mutts a new one.

346
00:26:35,313 --> 00:26:37,595
Or at least get you a few minutes'
head start, anyway.

347
00:26:41,493 --> 00:26:43,955
- I won't let you.
- This is why we're here, right?

348
00:26:45,448 --> 00:26:47,544
If I can get us a shot
on the devil...

349
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:51,150
Dean, we have to take it.

350
00:26:57,586 --> 00:27:00,451
This might be your last chance
to treat me like an adult.

351
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,621
You might wanna take it.

352
00:27:25,055 --> 00:27:26,255
You heard her.

353
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,271
Get to work.

354
00:28:19,212 --> 00:28:20,441
Okay, this is it.

355
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,849
See you on the other side.

356
00:28:26,616 --> 00:28:28,466
Probably sooner than later.

357
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:33,739
Make it later.

358
00:29:46,274 --> 00:29:48,119
Somebody's got to let them in.

359
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:50,079
And like you said,

360
00:29:50,204 --> 00:29:51,604
you're not moving.

361
00:29:54,956 --> 00:29:56,206
You got me, Jo.

362
00:29:58,378 --> 00:29:59,728
And you're right.

363
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,382
This is important.

364
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:05,052
But I will not leave you here alone.

365
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,474
Get goin' now, boys.

366
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:13,102
I said go.

367
00:30:18,676 --> 00:30:19,776
And, Dean...

368
00:30:21,576 --> 00:30:22,736
Kick it in the ass.

369
00:30:25,002 --> 00:30:26,052
Don't miss.

370
00:31:11,157 --> 00:31:13,107
I will always love you, baby.

371
00:31:22,975 --> 00:31:23,975
Honey?

372
00:31:27,114 --> 00:31:28,114
Jo...

373
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,360
It's okay.

374
00:31:38,282 --> 00:31:39,282
It's okay.

375
00:31:42,382 --> 00:31:43,882
That's my good girl.

376
00:32:11,223 --> 00:32:13,847
You can go straight back to hell,
you ugly bitch!

377
00:32:42,475 --> 00:32:45,017
We know what happened
to some of the town's people.

378
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:51,584
Last words?

379
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:00,627
I think I'm good.

380
00:33:03,423 --> 00:33:04,423
Me too.

381
00:33:10,418 --> 00:33:11,818
Here goes nothin'.

382
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,683
You wanted to see me?

383
00:33:33,818 --> 00:33:35,768
You don't need that gun here.

384
00:33:39,655 --> 00:33:41,105
I'd never hurt you.

385
00:33:42,122 --> 00:33:43,172
Not really.

386
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,734
Well, I'd hurt you.

387
00:33:51,316 --> 00:33:52,366
So suck it.

388
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:24,061
Where did you get that?

389
00:34:34,397 --> 00:34:35,397
Now...

390
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,960
Where were we?

391
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:41,842


392
00:34:43,198 --> 00:34:44,898
Don't feel too bad, Sam.

393
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,680
There's only five things
in all of creation

394
00:34:47,805 --> 00:34:49,305
that gun can't kill,

395
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:51,949
I happen to be one of them.

396
00:34:52,074 --> 00:34:53,537
But if you give me a minute,

397
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,141
I'm almost done.

398
00:35:00,491 --> 00:35:01,541
You know...

399
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:06,785
I don't suppose you'd just say yes
right here and now?

400
00:35:07,248 --> 00:35:10,020
End this whole tiresome discussion?

401
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:13,489
- That's crazy, right?
- It's never gonna happen!

402
00:35:14,164 --> 00:35:15,564
I don't know, Sam.

403
00:35:15,873 --> 00:35:17,173
I think it will.

404
00:35:18,112 --> 00:35:19,912
I think it'll happen soon.

405
00:35:20,037 --> 00:35:21,437
Within six months.

406
00:35:22,189 --> 00:35:24,039
And I think it'll happen...

407
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,214
In Detroit.

408
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:27,141
You listen to me,

409
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:29,293
you son of a bitch.

410
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:32,755
I'm gonna kill you myself.
You understand me?

411
00:35:33,586 --> 00:35:35,934
I'm going to rip your heart out!

412
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:37,149
That's good, Sam.

413
00:35:37,274 --> 00:35:39,874
You keep fanning that fire
in your belly.

414
00:35:40,318 --> 00:35:41,889
All that pent-up rage.

415
00:35:42,978 --> 00:35:44,378
I'm gonna need it.

416
00:35:48,207 --> 00:35:49,507
What did you do?

417
00:35:50,532 --> 00:35:54,276
- What did you do to this town?
- I was very generous with this town.

418
00:35:54,771 --> 00:35:57,054
One demon for every able-bodied man.

419
00:35:57,179 --> 00:35:58,729
And the rest of them?

420
00:36:02,923 --> 00:36:03,923
In there.

421
00:36:06,443 --> 00:36:08,243
I know, it's awful, but...

422
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,959
These horsemen are so demanding.

423
00:36:11,902 --> 00:36:13,002
So it was...

424
00:36:14,234 --> 00:36:15,547
Women and children first.

425
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,305
I know what you must think of me.

426
00:36:24,212 --> 00:36:25,812
But I have to do this.

427
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,142
I have to.

428
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:30,551
You, of all people,
should understand.

429
00:36:32,175 --> 00:36:33,757
What's that supposed to mean?

430
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:37,797
I was a son.

431
00:36:39,534 --> 00:36:42,034
A brother, like you.
A younger brother.

432
00:36:42,464 --> 00:36:44,964
And I had an older brother
who I loved.

433
00:36:45,744 --> 00:36:47,144
Idolized, in fact.

434
00:36:47,687 --> 00:36:50,387
And one day, I went to him
and I begged him

435
00:36:51,215 --> 00:36:52,292
to stand with me.

436
00:36:53,927 --> 00:36:55,127
And Michael...

437
00:36:57,351 --> 00:36:58,901
Michael turned on me.

438
00:37:00,678 --> 00:37:01,927
Called me a freak.

439
00:37:03,675 --> 00:37:04,675
A monster.

440
00:37:05,366 --> 00:37:07,116
And then he beat me down.

441
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,800
All because I was different.

442
00:37:10,155 --> 00:37:12,205
Because I had a mind of my own.

443
00:37:14,364 --> 00:37:15,691
Tell me something.

444
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:18,085
Any of this sound familiar?

445
00:37:22,911 --> 00:37:23,911
Anyway...

446
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:27,452
You'll have to excuse me.
Midnight is calling.

447
00:37:28,805 --> 00:37:30,713
And I have a ritual to finish.

448
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:32,094
Don't go anywhere.

449
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:34,004
Not that you could if you would.

450
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:50,181
Now, repeat after me.

451
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:52,899
We offer up our lives

452
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:55,780
blood, souls.

453
00:38:00,088 --> 00:38:01,838
To complete this tribute.

454
00:38:19,481 --> 00:38:20,481
What?

455
00:38:25,624 --> 00:38:27,124
They're just demons.

456
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,232
You seem pleased.

457
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,110
We're gonna win.

458
00:38:43,013 --> 00:38:44,313
Can you feel it?

459
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:50,118
You cloud-hopping pansies
lost the whole damn universe.

460
00:38:51,471 --> 00:38:53,621
Lucifer's gonna take over heaven.

461
00:38:54,264 --> 00:38:56,364
We're goin' to heaven, Clarence.

462
00:38:58,107 --> 00:38:59,107
Strange.

463
00:38:59,663 --> 00:39:02,839
Because I heard a different theory
from a demon named Crowley.

464
00:39:04,356 --> 00:39:05,634
You don't know Crowley.

465
00:39:06,072 --> 00:39:09,135
He believes that Lucifer
is just using demons

466
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,660
to achieve an end.

467
00:39:11,421 --> 00:39:12,471
And that...

468
00:39:13,694 --> 00:39:14,944
Once he does...

469
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,029
He'll destroy you all.

470
00:39:18,352 --> 00:39:19,481
You're wrong.

471
00:39:19,768 --> 00:39:21,968
Lucifer is the father of our race.

472
00:39:22,397 --> 00:39:23,497
Our creator.

473
00:39:24,686 --> 00:39:26,504
Your God may be a deadbeat,

474
00:39:26,629 --> 00:39:27,679
But mine...

475
00:39:28,163 --> 00:39:29,366
Mine walks the earth.

476
00:39:42,403 --> 00:39:44,453
You can't gank demons, can you?

477
00:39:45,523 --> 00:39:48,842
You're cut off from the home office,
and you ain't got the juice.

478
00:39:50,414 --> 00:39:52,864
So, what can you do,
you impotent sap?

479
00:39:55,575 --> 00:39:56,775
I can do this.

480
00:40:35,398 --> 00:40:37,656
Oh, hello, Death.

481
00:40:42,181 --> 00:40:43,982


482
00:40:45,023 --> 00:40:48,752
The governor has declared
a state of emergency

483
00:40:48,877 --> 00:40:50,377
for Paulding County,

484
00:40:50,644 --> 00:40:53,992
Including the towns of Marion,
Fetterville, and Carthage.

485
00:40:54,271 --> 00:40:57,336
The storm system has reportedly
touched off a number of tornadoes

486
00:40:57,461 --> 00:40:58,461
in the area.

487
00:40:58,586 --> 00:41:00,353
Death tolls
have yet to be estimated.

488
00:41:00,478 --> 00:41:04,428
But officials expect the loss of life
and property to be staggering.
