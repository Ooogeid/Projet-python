1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,300
Dad wants us to pick up where he left off --

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,100
saving people,hunting things...

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,300
the family business.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,800
You were the bank robber on the 11:00 news, not me.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,100
-Yeah.
-This is special agentvictor hendrickson.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,800
It's my jobto bring you in
--alive's a bonus but not necessary.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,500
I've been looking for you for weeks now.

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,100
And, yes,I know about sam, too.

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,500
I know about the murder in st. Louis,the
houdini act you pulled in baltimore.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,100
I know about the desecrationsand the thefts.

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,400
I know about your dad.

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,700
You don't know crap about my dad.

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,300
We are so screwed.

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,700
NOW

15
00:00:38,849 --> 00:00:42,266
Green River County
Detention Center

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,600
so, this makes a lot of sense.

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,600
First, they close down this cellblock,and
now they open itback up again.

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,700
There's your tax dollars at work.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,500
****

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,700
Yes

21
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,600
Would hate to have gotten thrown in here.

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,800
Hey, you feel that, man?

23
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,400
Who is that?

24
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,800
Hey!

00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,400
-Randall, cool it.

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,700
-There's somebody out there.
-Randall, turn out your light and go to sleep.

35
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,600
I'm not gonna say it again.

36
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,300
-Lights out, "b" block.
-Copy that.Lights out

37
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,900
No.

38
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No! No!No! No!

Okay, back to the line up.

-Wait, who looks better,me or nick nolte?
-Shut up.

59
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,900
Well, it's about time.I'll have a cheeseburger.

60
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,800
Extra onions.

61
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,800
-You think yo***.
-I think I'm adorable.

62
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,600
It is a pleasure to
finally meet you in person, dean.

63
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm special agentvictor hendrickson.
This is my partner --special agent reidy.

64
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,100
Hendrickson.

65
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,400
-Not the milwaukee agent hendrickson.
-Live and in person.

66
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,400
Oh, nice shot.

67
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,100
You can hang that upin your cell at supermax.

68
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,900
Maybe we can just forget the cheeseburgers, huh?

69
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Oh, yeah.Keep that game face on.

70
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,300
Try and cover up how cornered you are.

71
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,200
Read him the charges.

72
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,800
You got mail fraud,credit-card fraud.
grave desecration.

73
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,600
Skip to the good ones.

74
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,200
Armed robbery, kidnapping,and, oh,

75
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,100
three counts of first-degree murder.

76
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,000
And after milwaukee,your brother is
now a suspect in a murder case himself.

77
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,400
I'd say, for you two

78
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,500
"screwed to hell"is a major understatement.

79
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,700
Well, where there's life,there's hope, huh?

80
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,600
Aw. See,that's what I kept thinking as I was
searching for your asses all over hell and gone.

81
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,100
Your dad taught you well.

82
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,500
The way you cover your tracks,and,
after milwaukee,the way you

83
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,600
...Vanished.

84
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,000
Near went nuts trying to find you. Ask him.

85
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,800
He near went nuts.

86
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,500
And after all of that,you get
tripped upon a motion detector.

87
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,300
Pretty rookie move.I got to say, I was...

88
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,200
surprised.

89
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,400
-Dean winchester?
-In the flesh.

90
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,300
-And you are?
-Mara daniels --public defender's office.

91
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,600
I've been assigned you and your brother's case.

92
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,800
-Are you hendrickson?
-Yeah, and we're not quite done here.

93
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,800
Uh, yeah, you are,and if you don't mind...

94
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,300
I would like to meet with my clients privately.

95
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,500
Unfortunatly,Your arraignment
on the breaking-and-entering charge

96
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,700
won't be until tuesday.

97
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,000
-They'll keep us in county jail?
-That's right.

98
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,700
-Green river county detention center?
-Yes

99
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,100
and considering the charges you're facing,

100
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,000
no judge in his right mind is
going to grant you bail.

101
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,800
Yeah, we figured that.

102
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,100
Extradition papers have already been
filed from five separate states,

103
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,400
missouri and wisconsin being the biggest
concern --the bank robbery and the murder raps.

104
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,900
How long can we stall extradition?

105
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,600
A week. Maybe less.

106
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,600
All right.Let's go.***

107
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,500
***

108
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,400
***,baby.

109
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,500
Don't worry, sam.I promise
I won't trade you for smokes.

110
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,400
I call top bunk.

111
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,400
Okay.

112
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,600
My roommate doesn't say much.How's yours?

113
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Just keeps staring at me...

114
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,100
in a way that makes me really uneasy.

115
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,900
-Sounds like you're making new friends.
-Dean... 

116
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,400
this is, without a doubt,the
dumbest, craziest thing we've ever done

117
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,200
and that's in a long,
storied career of dumb and crazy.

118
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,700
-Calm down.It's all part of the plan.
-Oh, really?

119
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,100
Hendrickson showing up was part of the plan?

120
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,800
Yeah, that guy moves a little faster than I thought.

121
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,711
All we got to do is find this ghost

122
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:19,081
put the sucker down,then grab ourselves
a couple of those tear drop tattoos.

123
00:11:19,116 --> 00:11:20,300
That's not funny.

124
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,200
Dean, what about this escape plan?

125
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,200
It's a sure thing. I
wouldn't have gone in if it wasn'T.

126
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,200
I mean,come on, man.This place
has all the signs of a haunting.

127
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,000
-Innocent people are dead --four so far.
-Oh, yeah.Innocent.

128
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,900
What, are you from texas all of a sudden?

129
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,300
Just 'cause these people are in
jail doesn't mean they deserve to die

130
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,200
and if we don't stop this
thing,people are gonna continue to die.

131
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,800
-We do the job wherever it takes us.
-Look, dean.

132
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,900
Just be straight with me, all right?

133
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,000
-You're doing this for deacon?
-Damn right.

134
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,000
But we barely even know the guy.

135
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,300
We know he was in the corps with dad.
We know he saved dad's life.We know we owe him.

136
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,800
Yeah,all right.But don't you
think he's asking a little much?

137
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,700
Doesn't matter.

138
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,700
We may not be saints,but we're
loyal,and we pay our debts.

139
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,400
Now, that means something
to me,and it ought to to you.

140
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,600
I'm not thrilled about this either, man,

141
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,800
but deacon asked upto hunt this thing down.

142
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,900
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

143
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,500
-You know,this chicken isn't half bad.
-Great. Finish mine.

144
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,500
All right, so let's go backover this, dean.
Spirit suspect number oneis mark moody, right?

145
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,300
Yeah, psycho killer extraordinaire --

146
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
satanism, ritual murderer,died in jail.

147
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,500
-You sure it's him?
-Pretty sure.

148
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,800
Dean, considering our circumstances,I'm
gonna need better than "pretty sure."

149
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,600
Really pretty sure.

150
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,100
Moody diedof a heart attack,which is
what all the victims in here are dying of.

151
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,800
He diedin the old cellblock,which they
closed after he croaked, 30 years ago.

152
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,500
They just opened that back
up.That's when the killings started.

153
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,100
So you think his spirit was released somehow?

154
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,100
But what if he was already cremated?

155
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,500
I'm guessing there's something in the
old block that's keeping him around.

156
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,200
And whatever it is,we got to find it.
And, uh, you know the rest.I'm done.

157
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,200
-Sorry. I --
-watch where you're going.

158
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,300
Yeah. Sure.I just --

159
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,800
-he said he was sorry.
-Dean...

160
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,800
you talking to me?

161
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,300
Are you talking to me?

162
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,400
Great, another guy who's seen"taxi driver"
too many times.Yeah, I'm talking to you.

163
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,600
Trust me.Let it go.

164
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,000
Dean, come on.

165
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,600
See, that's how you got to talk to these guys.

166
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,900
Instant respect.

167
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,200
You were saying?

168
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,700
Oh, great.

169
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,700
***That's right, pal.

170
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,200
That's enough!

171
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,700
On your feet, lucas.

172
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,300
Yes, sir, boss.

173
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,600
-What's your name?
-Winchester.

174
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,500
Well, winchester...not a good start.

175
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Solitary.

176
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,500
-You too, lucas.
-Yes,sir.

177
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,600
Are we having fun yet,huh?

178
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,500
I wish I had a baseball.

179
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,600
What?What'd you say?

180
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,800
I said, "I wish I had a baseball."

181
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,300
-You know, like --like steve mcqueen.
-Yeah?

182
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,300
Well, I wish I had a bat so I
could bash your fricking head in.

183
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,600
Okay.

184
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,300
Well, so much for the bonding-in-solitary moment.

185
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,200
Crap.

186
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,400
Lucas, listen to me.Stay very still.

187
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,400
-Hendrickso
-Hey, daniels.

188
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,300
-Can I have a word?
-Have a seat.

189
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,000
-What's on your mind?
-I've been going through the winchester charges

190
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,948
and I got to say

191
00:16:48,082 --> 00:16:52,008
-there aresome weird in consistencies.
-Welcome to my world.

192
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:55,600
I talked to a cop in baltimore
who swears up and down

193
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,700
these boys saved her life and
helped her catch a killer.

194
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,000
And there's a witness to your bank robbery in milwaukee.
She swears sam and dean saved her life.

195
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,900
-Saved her from what?
-She was a little unclear on that.

196
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,100
That's because she's nuts.

197
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,000
Look,I was in milwaukee.I spoke
to her.I spoke to all the witnesses.

198
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,600
-And?
-And

199
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,200
all I know is,wherever these guys go,people die.

200
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,300
-It's that simple.
-I don't know that it is.

201
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,700
They just don't seem cut-and-dry guilty to me.

202
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,500
-I think there's more to this.
-Like what?

203
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,200
I don't know.

204
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,700
Can't put my finger on it.

205
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,500
It's just...

206
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,800
-Strange.
-Strange.

207
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,800
Yeah. Okay.

208
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,400
Grown-ups are trying to
get some work done here, so...

209
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,600
if you don't mind...

210
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,200
How you doing?

211
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,084
I'm 54 years old,mopping the floor
of a crapper with bars on the windows.

212
00:18:12,184 --> 00:18:14,332
How you think I'm doing?

213
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,300
All right.Bad icebreaker.

214
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,600
-I'm sam.
-Randall.

215
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,200
Nice to meet you.Randall.

216
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,200
-Hey, weren't you there the night that guard died?
-Yeah.

217
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,100
Well, what happened?

218
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,600
-They say the stress of the job got him.
-Yeah?

219
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
What do you say?

220
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,700
Why are you inside, kid?

221
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,900
'Cause I got an idiot for a brother.

222
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,700
-That'll do it.
-Yeah.

223
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:01,100
Well,this place ain't so bad.Compared to
the old cellblock,this is the damn hilton.

224
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,000
-You spent time in the old block?
-Oh, yeah,I was a regular customer.

225
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,300
-Didn't they have mark moody there for a while?
-He was there.

226
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,100
I was there, too, the night that lunatic bought it.

227
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,500
Yeah?It was a heart attack, right?

228
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,500
Sure, his heart stopped right after the guard
stopped using his head for batting practice.

229
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,100
The next morning,I was in his
cell,mopping up the blood.What a mess.

230
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,100
Wait. So he -- he was beaten 
and nobody reported it?

231
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,700
You kept your mouth shut,unless you wanted
to die from the same heart attack,you know?

232
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,300
Randall, exactly how much blood was there?

233
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,900
-Call.
-Three aces.

234
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,800
That's a bad beat.

235
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,100
That is a bad beat,but, see, I'm full...

236
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,300
3s over aces.

237
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,700
Sorry.Hey, it's a cruel game,my friend.

238
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,700
Sorry, guys.

239
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,900
-It's like picking low-hanging fruit.
-You don't even smoke.

240
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,600
This is the currency of the realm.

241
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,800
-Look. I got a good lead on moody.
-Me too.

242
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,400
-His spirit paid a little visit last night.
-What?

243
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,500
The clock stopped,the flickering lights,cold
spot -- I mean, he did everything but yell boo.

244
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,000
-Well, what happened?
-He walked right by me.

245
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,300
Lucas wasn't so lucky.
I mean,the way he was screaming...

246
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,800
guy was a jerk, but he
didn't deserve to go like that.

247
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,852
What'd you find out on moody?

248
00:20:39,913 --> 00:20:42,505
Yeah, I think I know where we
might find his remains --

249
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,400
-blood in his old cell.
-The blood?I thought it was a heart attack.

250
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,100
It was, after the guards worked him over.

251
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,400
**There was so much bloodin
there,they had trouble mopping it out.

252
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,100
-How we gonna get in?
-I got a plan.

253
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,200
That's the sammy I know.You're like
clint eastwood from "escape from alcatraz."

254
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,300
****Even if we do find
something,how are we gonna burn it?

255
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,100
We don't have any accelerant.

256
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,500
Good thing I'm like james
garner from "the great escape."

257
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,700
Hey, fellas!Who's ready to deal?

258
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,800
-You sure about this?
-Pretty sure.

259
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,100
Yeah, well, considering our circumstances,
I'd like a little better than "pretty sure."

260
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,000
Okay --really pretty sure.

261
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,400
I'd like mine al dente.

262
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,900
Perfect.

263
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,000
Save room for dessert,tiny.

264
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,300
Hey, I wanted to ask you, 'causeI couldn't
help but notice that you are two tons of fun.

265
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,500
Just curious -- is it likea thyroid problem,or
is it some deep-seatedself-esteem issue?

266
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,800
'Cause, you know, they're,
uh --they're just dough nuts.

267
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,400
They're not love.

268
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,300
Guys, give me a hand.

269
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,000
If we'd waited any longer,you'd be dead.

270
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,300
You waited long enough.

271
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,400
Do yourself a favor.Don't talk.

272
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,800
Take them both up to the infirmary.

273
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,700
-Hey, tiny.
-Yeah?

274
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,600
Hey, sorry about the things I was saying earlier.

275
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,800
Can't really tell you why
but I had to get you angry.

276
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,100
So, uh...

277
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,000
-anyway, sorry.
-It's okay.

278
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,700
Truth is, I have low-self-esteem issues.

279
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,000
My old man treated meand my brother like crap,

280
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,100
right up till the day he died.

281
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,200
-How'd he die?
-My brother shot him.

282
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,100
Okay.

283
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,100
-Oh, crap.
-What is it?

284
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,500
What is going on?

285
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,200
What is it?

286
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,900
-Oh! No! No!
-Tiny! Tiny!

287
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,300
Guard!

288
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,500
Guard!

289
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,500
Wait. So you're telling me it wasn't moody?

290
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,300
Not unless he liked going
around dressed like a nurse.

291
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,800
-Poor tiny, man.Poor giant tiny.
-Wait, so this is --this is, like

292
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,100
-the ghost of some nurse who worked here or something?
-I don't know, man.I guess.

293
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,500
***At this point, "I don't
know"isn't working for me.

294
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,200
See, uh,I thought we were done.
I called Deacon.It's happening.

295
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,697
We're getting out tonight.

296
00:26:05,853 --> 00:26:07,828
I guess we got to do some quick research, then.

297
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,500
How?!I mean, maybe you haven't noticed --

298
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,700
we're in jail.

299
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,100
You want to know about some nurse?

300
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,100
-Why you want to know?
-We got our reasons,

301
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,200
but, uh, we'll make it worth your while.

302
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,100
So, this nurse,she would have white hair,one
screwed-up eye --is that ringing a bell?

303
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,900
-Yeah.Yeah, I remember her.
-You remember her name?

304
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,400
No, that's still kind of fuzzy.

305
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,500
Give it to him.

306
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
-I earned these.
-Dean.

307
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,300
Glockner --nurse glockner.
Nasty old bitch worked here in the '70s.

308
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,400
-You knew her?
-I met her once.

309
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,400
Had to geta tetanus shot.She damn
near jabbed the needle through my arm.

310
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,700
-At least I got out of there alive.
-What do you mean?

311
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,800
I've heard these stories.I
don't know if they were true.

312
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,000
-Cons love to talk,but we're all liars.
-What kind of stories?

313
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,700
Guys would go up with a cold.
Next thing you know,they're in a body bag.

314
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,619
A whole rash of heart attacks
--young guys, old guys.

315
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,099
-Heart attacks?
-Yeah.

316
00:27:24,134 --> 00:27:26,076
The story was glockner had it out for cons

317
00:27:26,176 --> 00:27:30,565
and she did this, uh,charles
bronson thing with a hypodermic.

318
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,200
Anyway, that was the rumor.
Nobody ever proved anything.

319
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,800
-Whatever happened to glockner?
-I don't know.

320
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,700
I finished my bitand left.Next time
I landed back in here,she was gone.

321
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,044
Okay, so let's say those
stories on glockner were true.

322
00:27:43,116 --> 00:27:44,224
It's a thought.

323
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,900
-In life, she's a vigilante.In death, same thing.
-Right

324
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,100
but how is she tied in with the old cellblock?

325
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,000
And if she's going after
cons,why kill that one guard?

326
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,600
I did hear in the yard that that
guard wasn't exactly squeaky clean,so

327
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,600
maybe she's going after anybody
that breaks a law,like me.

328
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,400
-You heard in the yard?
-Yeah.

329
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,986
Does it bother you at all
how easily you seem to fit in here?

330
00:28:05,086 --> 00:28:06,187
No, not really.

331
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,800
All right. Either way,we
need more info on glockner.

332
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,800
If she's buried --if so, where?

333
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,800
And we got five hours to get it.

334
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,300
No, no.Don't give me that "we got
to see this thing through" look.

335
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,400
We are leaving tonight,no matter what.

336
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,600
-I don't want to let Deacon down.We do owe him.
-Yeah,but we don't owe him our lives, dean.

337
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,000
Where you going?

338
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,400
I'm gonna go talk with our lawyer.

339
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,000
-You want me to what?
-Her name was glockner.

340
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,500
She worked here as a nurse in the '70s.

341
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,400
I need you to find out everything you
can about her but, most importantly

342
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,900
-how she died and where she's buried.
-Are you nuts?

343
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,700
Do you have any idea the kind of trouble you're in?

344
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,500
-I have a vague notion.
-Good

345
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,500
so let's forget about some random
nurse and talk about your case.

346
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,900
-Mara --it's mara, right?
-Yeah.

347
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,400
I get that you're trying to help me.

348
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,900
I do, but believe me when I say that
this is the best way that you can help.

349
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,700
-Really? How?Explain that to me.
-I wish I could,but I can'T.

350
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,698
I'm just gonna have to
ask you to trust me on this.

351
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,245
Why should I?

352
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,400
-Hendrickson says you're a monster.
-I'm a monster?

353
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,900
Well, h-he's wrong, okay?

354
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,800
I'm not what they say I am.

355
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,700
-Everybody says that.
-Yeah.

356
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,500
If you're as smart a P.D.As I think you are,

357
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,300
then you can tell with just one look whether
or not your clients are guilty, just like that.

358
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,200
So I want you to look at me,really look,

359
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,600
and you tell me --am I guilty?

360
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,800
We're not the bad guys.

361
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,700
-Did she go for it?
-No. No, not so much.

362
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,200
-But maybe she'll still come around.
-We can't wait to find out.

363
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,900
-We could give it another day.
-No, no, no. We're leaving tonight, and that's it.

364
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,900
-So we're just gonna let these people die?
-Don't give me that,all right?

365
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,900
This was your stupid plan.I went along
with it,but we're sticking to the plan.

366
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,600
Okay.Uh, you leave.I'm gonna stay.

367
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,900
-Don't turn away.Don't turn away from me.
-Screw you.

368
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,500
What?!Screw you!

369
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,200
All right, hard case.I see the usual
methods ain't gonna work with you.

370
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,400
You too, sweetheart.

371
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,900
Take off.

372
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,800
I want to handle this alone.

373
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,502
Deacon, you are beating the holy hell out of me, man.

374
00:31:04,676 --> 00:31:06,273
Sorry, dean.

375
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,400
I thought I was going easy on you.

376
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:15,100
-Just, uh,trying to make it look real.
-Yeah. Well,mission accomplished.

377
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,400
-Thanks.
-So, is it over?

378
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,900
-No.Turns out, it wasn't moody.
-What?

379
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,000
-Yeah.
-Then who?

380
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,900
Uh, we think it's some nurse who used to
work here,but we're shy on all the intel.

381
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,600
Which is why we should stick around.
Until we find it.

382
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,100
-Oh,hey guys.
-You want to have this fight for real, dean?

383
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,500
We got to go.We've got to go now!

384
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,000
-Guys.
-We are leaving dean.

385
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,200
Otherwise, we'll be leaving in shackles
for milwaukee,with hendrickson as company.

386
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,300
-Oh, come on.
-Guys!

387
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,000
-What?!
-What?!

388
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
Your lawyer left this for you.

389
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,200
-Would you look at that.
-Man, I am freaking velvety smooth.

390
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,500
You want to, maybe,open it up after
you're done patting yourself on the back?

391
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

392
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,000
-Wow.
-What?You want to share with the class, dean?

393
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,000
Glockner died in the
old cellblock after moody bit it.

394
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,100
Seems they had a little inmate uprising.

395
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,500
She ****

396
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,500
They dragged her to a solitary cell
gave hera severe cerebral edema.

397
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,800
-Someone bashed her head in.
-Yeah.

398
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,300
-Does it say where she's buried?
-Yep.

399
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,200
All right, then, let's get you the hell out of here.

400
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,800
Don't worry, Deacon.We'll get rid of this thing.

401
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,400
Good, 'cause I want it out of my prison.

402
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,600
Boys, uh...

403
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,200
I can't thank you enough for this.

404
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,100
I know it was asking a lot
but you still came through.

405
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,500
Your daddy raised you right.

406
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,200
-Well, we owed you.
-Right.

407
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,400
-Hope to see you again,huh?
-Just not in here,okay?

408
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,600
Yeah, we'll do our best.

409
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,700
Oh...

410
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,300
-where do you want it?
-What?

411
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,200
Yeah, um...um...

412
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,600
make it look real, son.

413
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,700
oh, man, are you a sight for sore eyes.

414
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,727
You know, I almost wish I
could see hendrickson's face.

415
00:33:30,897 --> 00:33:33,901
Really?'Cause I'd be happy if
I never saw him again.

416
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,800
-We're not really out of the woods yet, dean, you know?
-Yeah.

417
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,700
Good point.

418
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,200
I told you.One of them came up behind me.

419
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,400
-You let them get the drop on you.
-Yeah.

420
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,400
I screwed up, all right?
What do you want me to say?

421
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,400
I want to know where they're headed.

422
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,400
-How the hell would I know?
-Let's start over again.

423
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,300
-For god's sake.
-Again --

424
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,300
I want to know everything they did
today,from the minute they woke up.

425
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,800
Got up...

426
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,100
breakfast,visiting hours,rec time.

427
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,600
-Any visitors?
-Just their lawyer.

428
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,900
It's an easy question.
What did you and Dean talk about?

429
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,300
I have already told you.It was a private
conversation between me and my client.

430
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,200
Right, and three hours later
he just happened to bust out.

431
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,700
Now,tell me what he said.

432
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,500
We got to move it.If
hendrickson gets to the lawyer...

433
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,200
I thought she couldn't say anything --
you know, that whole lawyer-client-privilege thing.

434
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,600
-The privilege doesn't apply, dean.
-So she'll talk?

435
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,200
She has to.

436
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,400
That's freaking super.

437
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,900
Let***

438
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
You don't come clean,I will put you
on the hook for aiding and abetting.

439
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,900
-That is ridiculous.
-You don't think that I can?!

440
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,800
You think this is some kind of game, lady?!

441
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,400
I am the last person you want to screw with.

442
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,800
Now, tell me...

443
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,500
what he said.

444
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,700
He wanted me to do some research...

445
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,700
-...on a prison nurse that died in 1976.
-What? Why?

446
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,200
-I don't know.
-What else?

447
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:54,500
-They wanted to know where she was buried.
-Did you find out where?

448
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,500
-Yeah.
-Did you tell them?

449
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,400
yeah.

450
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,700
Tell me.

451
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,300
Mountainside Cemetery

452
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,300
Got her.

453
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,000
You let those two go.

454
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,100
Are you sure this is the right damn cemetery?

455
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,500
She said mountainside --mountainside cemetery.

456
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,200
GREEN VALLEY CEMETERY

457
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,900
- thought we were screwed before?
- Yeah, I know.

458
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,400
- We got to go deep this time.
-"Deep," dean?

459
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,000
- We should go to yemen.
- Ooh, I'm --

460
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,500
I'm not sure I'm ready to go that deep.
