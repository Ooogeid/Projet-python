1
00:00:08,176 --> 00:00:09,819
So, you're offering up your own soul?

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,846
All you got to do is bring sam back.

3
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:13,688
- How long did they give you?
- One year.

4
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:15,960
- I don't want to go to hell.
- We'll find a way to save you.

00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:17,830

00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,604
Sweet lord of the rings.

13
00:00:36,684 --> 00:00:37,781
Run!

14
00:00:37,782 --> 00:00:39,736
Forget it. I'm not going
back in there again.

15
00:00:39,737 --> 00:00:41,854
Harry, this is our ticket
to the big time...

16
00:00:41,855 --> 00:00:44,250
Fame, money, sex...

17
00:00:45,386 --> 00:00:46,676

23
00:00:58,161 --> 00:01:01,480
You must be some sort of bigwig
network executive.

24
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:04,314
Well, today is your lucky day, mister.

25

Is the bold, new future of "reality tv."

27
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:14,366
We know you've had it hard
during the crippling writers' strike.

28
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:16,055
Lazy fat cats.

29
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:18,710
Who needs writers when
you got guys like us?

30
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:21,690

31
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:26,660

Strap in for...

36

"Ghostfacers."

37
00:02:42,378 --> 00:02:43,960
You know, it can get kind of hard

38
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:47,230
Balancing our daytime careers
with our nighttime missions.

39
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:49,760
Yeah, but ed and i pretty
much call the shots

40
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:51,569
At the kinko's where we work,

41
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,255
So we can usually pretty much
get off by 6:00 every night?

42
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:55,689
Yeah, 6:00.

43
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,010
It's used to be just, you know,
you and i taking on the cases...

44
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:01,603
- Just harry and me.
- Two lone wolves.

45
00:03:01,604 --> 00:03:04,856
And two lone wolves need, uh...

46
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:07,315
Other wolves.

47
00:03:10,814 --> 00:03:14,190
- Morning, 'facers.
- Good morning, ghostfacers.

48
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:17,342
- It's 7:00 p.M., dude.
- It's morning to a ghostfacer.

49
00:03:17,343 --> 00:03:20,201
- Corbett, what do we got, buddy?
- Oh, i'm just putting up some of the...

50
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:23,334
Yeah, this has got to go up here. That's
got to go here. Got to see the whole field.

51
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:25,450
Markers, eraser... good job.

52
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:27,765
I first saw ed

53
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,303
Putting up flyers down at the...

54
00:03:31,573 --> 00:03:34,115
The outlet mall in scogan,

55
00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:36,220
So i read one,

56
00:03:36,505 --> 00:03:39,720
And i thought to myself, "huh.

57
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:42,589
Where do ghosts come from?"

58
00:03:42,741 --> 00:03:45,488
And now here i am.

59
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,523
Ed, your sister's abusing staff.

60
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:56,257
That's adopted sister,
thank you very much.

61
00:03:56,346 --> 00:03:59,890
Ed has been obsessed with the
supernatural since we were kids,

62
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:03,330
You know, and then he meets
harry at computer camp,

63
00:04:03,348 --> 00:04:05,125
And love at first geek.

64
00:04:06,717 --> 00:04:08,234
Spruce here.

65
00:04:08,297 --> 00:04:11,030
What up, player?

66
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:16,170
I am 15/16 jew, 1/16 cherokee.

67
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:18,184
My grandfather is a mohel,

68
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:22,257
My great-Grandfather
was a tallis maker,

69
00:04:22,258 --> 00:04:26,860
And my great-Great-Grandfather
was a degenerate gambler

70
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:29,161
And had a peyote addiction.

71
00:04:29,162 --> 00:04:32,810
Okay, people. Let's cut the
chatter and get on a mission.

72
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,654
Morton house...

73
00:04:38,716 --> 00:04:40,561
... one of our big fish.

74
00:04:40,562 --> 00:04:42,480
All right, we all know the legend.

75
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:44,630
Every four years, supposedly,

76
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:47,710
This becomes the most
haunted place in america.

77
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:51,605
The leap year ghost, some call it.

78
00:04:52,104 --> 00:04:55,830
The ghost returns at midnight
just as february 29th begins.

79
00:04:55,831 --> 00:04:57,663
And no one has ever stayed
the night, right?

80
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,740
Yeah, well, every testimony
that we dug up,

81
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:02,017
Every eyewitness has cut and
run well before midnight.

82
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:05,538
Well, that's all about to change.
Absolutely true, ed.

83
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,923
- Absolutely true.
- Mmm. That's good.

84
00:05:07,924 --> 00:05:10,550
It's french vanilla,
cause the other day,

85
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:13,215
You said how much you liked it, so...

86
00:05:13,216 --> 00:05:14,676
Thank you.

87
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,010
You are welcome.

88
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:25,360
I like corbett. I do.

89
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:30,690
Shows up early, does his job,
lot of good hustle out...

90
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:39,537
I think he's got the hots for ed,

91
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:41,600
And that could spell trouble
for the whole team.

92
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:43,827
Ed's kind of the more rugged, with

93
00:05:43,828 --> 00:05:46,050
That really golden...

94
00:05:47,423 --> 00:05:50,646
Beautiful sort of beard.
Definitely nice.

95
00:05:51,054 --> 00:05:54,050
Uh, and harry's nice.

96
00:05:54,507 --> 00:05:58,550
29th is this friday, facers.

97
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:02,010
We want this mission, we got to
move on it now, or guess what...

98
00:06:02,011 --> 00:06:03,882
He's gone for another four years.

99
00:06:03,883 --> 00:06:06,424
- Oh, watch out!
- Who is that?

100
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:14,230
- Dad! Come on.
- Just cut the cameras. We don't need that.

101
00:06:14,231 --> 00:06:15,779
We don't need this part. We don't...

102
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:24,070
Stay low. Follow formation.

103
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:28,220
Okay, as suspected.

104
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:32,510
A lot of people have tried to
break into the morton house.

105
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:35,395
The local authorities
have just gotten fed up.

106
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:38,721
Looks like the cops have got this
place pretty well fenced off.

107
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:40,750
Wait.

108
00:06:40,751 --> 00:06:43,120
Didn't you guys get, like,
a permit or something?

109
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:45,490
A permit? That's a
good idea for next time.

110
00:06:45,491 --> 00:06:46,540
Yeah.

111
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:48,300
Car!

112
00:06:48,301 --> 00:06:49,769
- Car.
- Car.

113
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,362
Flashlights off.

114
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,008
It's okay. Not cops... just hicks.

115
00:07:26,518 --> 00:07:29,268
Oh, right on.
Guys, let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

116
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:31,660
Go! Go!

117
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,780
Hear that, people?
Let's keep it quiet.

118
00:07:44,516 --> 00:07:46,320
There's the kitchen sink.

119
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:47,932
Copy that.

120
00:07:51,827 --> 00:07:53,453
All right, everybody.

121
00:07:53,454 --> 00:07:55,530
Ghostfacers, let's line up.

122
00:07:55,531 --> 00:07:56,999
Everybody.

123
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,300
We'll set up camp right here.
This is command center one.

124
00:08:00,301 --> 00:08:01,875
We'll call this the eagle's nest.

125
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,275
- Hallway cam one up and running.
- Looking good, corbett.

126
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,753
Copy that, ed.

127
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,160
Uh... uh, you're welcome.

128
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:32,970
All right, spruce,
how are we doing there, buddy?

129
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,135
Checking basement
camera two, mein fuhrer.

130
00:08:35,136 --> 00:08:37,076
Maggie, i got no visual on you, maggie.

131
00:08:37,077 --> 00:08:38,943
- This is maggie. Do you copy?
- There you are. Hello.

132
00:08:38,944 --> 00:08:41,340
- Harry, are you alive?
- Upstairs, ed. Camera one.

133
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:43,270
Looking good. I can smell syndication.

134
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:46,271
All right, fellas.
Let's regroup at the eagle nest.

135
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,919
All right, spangler.

136
00:08:48,953 --> 00:08:50,920
Battery check, battery check. Check.

137
00:08:51,387 --> 00:08:53,342
Check. Check.

138
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:56,800
Yo, robocop.

139
00:08:56,922 --> 00:08:58,360
R-Robocop?

140
00:08:59,212 --> 00:09:00,977
You think i...
you think i look like robocop?

141
00:09:00,978 --> 00:09:02,918
Everybody, bring it in. Bring it in.

142
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:05,397
We've all been here before.
Standard walk-Through.

143
00:09:05,398 --> 00:09:08,468
Team one, west. Team two, east.

144
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:10,530
Spin the tires, light the fires.

145
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:11,925
Ghostfacers on three.

146
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,470
1, 2, 3...

147
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,883
Ghostfacers!

148
00:09:24,153 --> 00:09:25,738
Hello!

149
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,750
I'm speaking to the restless
spirits of the morton house!

150
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,940
Hello!

151
00:09:36,941 --> 00:09:38,911
My name's ed.

152
00:09:42,455 --> 00:09:44,108
Careful.

153
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:47,530
Watch my back.

154
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:53,719
What's your name?

155
00:09:54,979 --> 00:09:56,796
.3, .29.

156
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,078
Is there an entity or
entities here with us now?

157
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:04,919
- Can you give us a sign of your presence?
- You got to breathe, buddy.

158
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,252
I can't breathe.

159
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,520
Corbett, night vision.

160
00:10:15,347 --> 00:10:17,680
Calm down, buddy. Breathe, all right?

161
00:10:17,681 --> 00:10:20,270
Calm the whirlwinds of your mind.

162
00:10:24,162 --> 00:10:28,530
We're doing a basic emf,
evp, temp-Flux sweep.

163
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,340
Looks like we've got all
of our ducks in a row here.

164
00:10:41,852 --> 00:10:43,232
What?

165
00:10:43,345 --> 00:10:46,210
I don't know. It's weird.

166
00:10:51,915 --> 00:10:53,390
It's gone.

167
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,290
All right. Get this. Get this.

168
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:02,381
- Turn the knob.
- All right...

169
00:11:04,972 --> 00:11:06,820
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

170
00:11:06,821 --> 00:11:08,320
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

171
00:11:08,321 --> 00:11:10,314
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

172
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:14,247
- It's just like rats, dude.
- I don't really like rats.

173
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:16,706
They're gross.

174
00:11:16,707 --> 00:11:20,146
Rats are like the rats of the world.

175
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:24,151
What... was that an apparition?
Was that a spectral... was that a .4?

176
00:11:24,152 --> 00:11:26,411
What do we got, 'cause the
emp was just off the...

177
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:27,751
Oh, god!

178
00:11:27,752 --> 00:11:29,987
Oh, that is so not funny, spruce!

179
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:38,249
Oh, god. Okay, it was just...

180
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,620
I think it was just this branch...

181
00:11:39,621 --> 00:11:42,320
Okay... in the window.

182
00:11:42,445 --> 00:11:43,890
This is spooky, man.

183
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:45,051
This place...

184
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:47,427
Oh, no!

185
00:11:47,428 --> 00:11:49,810
Freeze! Police officers! Don't move!

186
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:52,610
All right. All right. All right.

187
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,910
Let's see some identification.
Come on. Let's see some i.D.

188
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:57,170
What... are we under... under arrest?

189
00:11:59,478 --> 00:12:02,900
Want to explain that
weirdo outfit, mr. Corbett?

190
00:12:04,037 --> 00:12:05,772
I know you.

191
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:08,020
Yeah, sure you do.
Give me some identification.

192
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:10,977
Yeah, ho... whoa, hold on a second.
I know the both of you guys. Yeah.

193
00:12:11,004 --> 00:12:12,430
What?

194
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:13,990
Holy

195
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:16,010
What?

196
00:12:16,731 --> 00:12:18,680
Uh, west texas...

197
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:20,607
The... the...
the tulpa we had to take out,

198
00:12:20,608 --> 00:12:23,286
Those two goofballs that
almost got us killed...

199
00:12:23,287 --> 00:12:25,512
The hellhounds or something?

200
00:12:28,793 --> 00:12:29,870
Me.

201
00:12:29,871 --> 00:12:31,264
Yeah, we're not hellhounds anymore, okay?

202
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:32,780
- It didn't test that well.
- Ed, what's going on?

203
00:12:32,781 --> 00:12:34,480
They're not cops, buddy...
no, not at all.

204
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:36,891
Ed, ed, you had a partner,
too, didn't you... a different guy?

205
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:38,450
Oh, yeah, yeah. Is he
around here somewhere?

206
00:12:38,451 --> 00:12:39,990
He's running around, chasing ghosts.

207
00:12:39,991 --> 00:12:41,880
Okay, well, listen, you and rambo

208
00:12:41,881 --> 00:12:43,912
Need to get your girlfriends
and get out of here.

209
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,455
All right.

210
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:47,720
Listen here, chisel chest, okay?

211
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,490
We were here first.
We've already set up base camp.

212
00:12:51,898 --> 00:12:53,402
We beat you.

213
00:12:54,205 --> 00:12:55,913
They were here first.

214
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,539
Oh, god.

215
00:12:58,592 --> 00:13:00,039
- Ed...
- Yeah?

216
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,940
...where's your partner?

217
00:13:03,685 --> 00:13:07,720
10.6. 10.7, guys.
The emf is really spiking here.

218
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:09,370
Pressure's down, like, 11 degrees.

219
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,134
All right, all right,
keep your eyes peeled.

220
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,434
This could be it.

221
00:13:12,796 --> 00:13:15,119
Maggie, can i get a
reading in here, please?

222
00:13:18,508 --> 00:13:20,540
Something keeps messing with the chip.

223
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,311
I don't know what's going on here.

224
00:13:23,117 --> 00:13:25,930
Guys. Guys. Guys.

225
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:29,600
Look buddy, i'm sorry. That's it.

226
00:13:29,945 --> 00:13:32,323
I'm telling you,
that's all the money i...

227
00:13:43,385 --> 00:13:45,340
On leap year... what are you thinking?

228
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:48,060
We're here to spend the night,
okay? It's for our tv show.

229
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,300
What? Great. Perfect.

230
00:13:50,301 --> 00:13:52,080
Yeah, nobody's ever
spent the night before.

231
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,596
- Actually, yeah, they have.
- Uh, we've never heard of them.

232
00:13:54,597 --> 00:13:55,900
Yeah, you know why?

233
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,480
Cause the ones that have
haven't lived to talk about it!

234
00:13:58,574 --> 00:14:00,620
Oh, come on, i don't believe you.

235
00:14:00,621 --> 00:14:02,380
Look... missing-Persons reports

236
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:04,137
Going back almost a half century.

237
00:14:05,206 --> 00:14:08,170
John graham stayed
on a dare... gone.

238
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:10,587
Julie wilkerson... gone.
There are tons more.

239
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:13,801
All of them came to just stay the night
through, always on a leap year.

240
00:14:13,802 --> 00:14:17,057
The only body they ever found
was the last owner, freeman daggett.

241
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:19,000
- These look legit.
- They are legit.

242
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:20,965
Look, ed, we ain't got
much time here, buddy.

243
00:14:20,966 --> 00:14:23,436
Starting at midnight,
your friends are going to die.

244
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,029
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

245
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

246
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:30,090
Guys! Guys! Oh, my god!
Oh, my god! We got one!

247
00:14:30,091 --> 00:14:32,098
Corbett! Corbett,
we saw one! We saw one!

248
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:34,609
It was a full apparition!
It was like a class four.

249
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,626
It was a spectral illumination! It...

250
00:14:40,057 --> 00:14:42,954
Hey, aren't those the from texas?

251
00:14:42,955 --> 00:14:44,018
Yes.

252
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:46,249
All right, let's have this
reunion across the street, guys.

253
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,418
Come on, come on.
We'll get you ice cream... our treat.

254
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:49,909
What do you say? Let's go.

255
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,489
Yeah, i say no. Look at this.
Look, look. Ed, ed.

256
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,600
No. No. Look at this.

257
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,931
Okay, honest-To-God proof, all right?

258
00:14:58,513 --> 00:15:00,577
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah. No, not kidding.

259
00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:01,899
What kind of reading did we get?

260
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,521
Uh, it was a 10.9.

261
00:15:03,522 --> 00:15:04,440
10.9?

262
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:05,992
Yeah, it was 10.9. It was almost 11.

263
00:15:05,993 --> 00:15:08,180
I came out, and i was like,
"what's going on?"

264
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:10,153
- And i was like...
- Wait, watch this.

265
00:15:10,806 --> 00:15:12,280
Oh! He got blasted.

266
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:13,594
It was crazy.

267
00:15:19,675 --> 00:15:21,100
What's a death echo?

268
00:15:21,101 --> 00:15:23,980
We got a problem here.
That ghost ain't it.

269
00:15:23,981 --> 00:15:25,573
Yeah, that's real.
Like, that happened.

270
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:27,240
What's a death echo?

271
00:15:27,472 --> 00:15:29,780
Echoes are trapped in a loop, okay?

272
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:32,844
They keep replaying how they died
over and over and over again,

273
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:34,484
Usually in the place
where they were ganked.

274
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:36,280
It's about as dangerous
as a scary movie.

275
00:15:36,281 --> 00:15:38,886
Maybe the echo's not dangerous,
but maybe something else is.

276
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:40,598
You're right. All right,
we need to get out of here, guys.

277
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:42,080
Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

278
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:43,187
Pack it up.

279
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:48,320
What about all of our equipment?

280
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,156
We got more material.
We got all kinds of stuff.

281
00:15:52,157 --> 00:15:53,932
We'll make you guys
recurring guest stars.

282
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:55,358
Wait!

283
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:58,269
Where's corbett?

284
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:01,540
I wish to communicate with
the restless spirits here.

285
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,700
Uh, lights out?

286
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:13,370
Oh, i think i got night vision here.

287
00:16:19,294 --> 00:16:20,797
That's better.

288
00:16:20,798 --> 00:16:22,918
No man left behind.

289
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,440
That was corbett.

290
00:16:28,506 --> 00:16:30,419
We'll get him! Go back!

291
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,674
Guys!

292
00:16:32,584 --> 00:16:34,980
No! Where are you, dude?

293
00:16:35,063 --> 00:16:36,785
Tell us where you are!

294
00:16:37,423 --> 00:16:38,667
Let me go!

295
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,570
Guys!

296
00:16:40,571 --> 00:16:41,950
You need to come back, corbett.

297
00:16:41,951 --> 00:16:42,950
No!!

298
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:44,576
Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on.

299
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,610
Corbett's...

300
00:16:54,611 --> 00:16:56,399
He's not here. Let's go. Let's go.

301
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,536
No. No. No. But that's corbett.

302
00:16:58,537 --> 00:17:00,210
No, that was corbett.
Didn't you hear that?

303
00:17:00,211 --> 00:17:01,350
Go, go, go, come on.

304
00:17:01,351 --> 00:17:03,300
Guys. Guys. Guys.

305
00:17:03,301 --> 00:17:05,642
Here we go. Here we go. Keep
it moving. Keep it moving.

306
00:17:07,315 --> 00:17:09,510
Hey. Hey. Hey. Watch him. Watch him.

307
00:17:10,213 --> 00:17:11,935
Go. Go. Move. Move.

308
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:13,660
Turn it off!

309
00:17:14,063 --> 00:17:16,310
Oh, god, what's happened?

310
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,140
Oh, god. He's gone.

311
00:17:19,268 --> 00:17:20,990
He just disappeared.

312
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:23,707
Let's just go through all the angles. Let's
go through all the cameras we have.

313
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,116
- Well, it's 12:04, dean. You good? You happy?
- Yeah, i am happy.

314
00:17:26,117 --> 00:17:29,140
"Let's go hunt the morton house," you said.
"It's our grand canyon."

315
00:17:29,141 --> 00:17:31,450
- I don't want to hear this.
- You got two months left, dean.

316
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:33,307
Instead, we're gonna die tonight.

317
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,307
What the hell is going on?

318
00:17:36,308 --> 00:17:37,742
I'll tell you what's going on.

319
00:17:37,743 --> 00:17:39,070
Every door, every window,

320
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,060
I'm guessing every
exit out of this house...

321
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,329
They're all sealed.

322
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,050
- Why are they sealed?
- It's a supernatural lockdown, okay?

323
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:47,300
Whatever took corbett
doesn't want us to leave,

324
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:50,498
And it's no death echo. This is a
bad mother, and it wants us scared.

325
00:17:50,716 --> 00:17:52,657
Or it just wants us.

326
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:57,710
Uh, guys, the camera's fritzing again.

327
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,637
Guys, the emf's
starting to spike.

328
00:18:02,186 --> 00:18:04,674
Everybody, stay close.
There's something coming.

329
00:18:13,189 --> 00:18:15,180
Is this the same echo
you guys saw earlier?

330
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:16,620
No, it's a different guy.

331
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:18,377
Multiple echoes?
What the hell's going on?

332
00:18:18,378 --> 00:18:19,547
Beats me.

333
00:18:19,548 --> 00:18:21,497
Okay. All right. All right. All right.

334
00:18:21,498 --> 00:18:23,265
Uh, hey, buddy!

335
00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:26,490
Hey. Hey. Wake up. You're dead!

336
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,205
- Hello!
- What's he doing? What's he doing?

337
00:18:29,206 --> 00:18:31,810
It's rare, but sometimes you can
shock an echo out of its loop

338
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:33,880
If you can talk to the part of
the ghost that's still human,

339
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:37,116
But usually you have to have some
kind of connection to the deceased.

340
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,212
Come on! Wake up! Be dead!

341
00:18:41,852 --> 00:18:43,960
You guys hear that? What's that sound?

342
00:18:43,961 --> 00:18:45,384
You guys hear that?

343
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,745
Snap out of it, buddy, huh?

344
00:18:47,746 --> 00:18:50,616
Come on, what are you waiting for?
You're gonzo! You're dead! Hey!

345
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:55,159
Where the hell did it go?

346
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:06,310
Dude, there's no records
of any of this here.

347
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,160
No one got shot here. Obviously, no
one got run over by a freaking train.

348
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:11,196
- Stay close.
- Did the echoes take corbett?

349
00:19:11,197 --> 00:19:12,900
Yes. No. I don't know. We don't know

350
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,020
That's what we're trying
to figure out, okay?

351
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:16,571
All right, stay close.

352
00:19:18,297 --> 00:19:21,660
Okay, look, death echoes
are ghosts, okay?

353
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,640
Now, ghosts... they usually haunt places
where they lived or where they died.

354
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:26,624
Except these mooks
didn't live or die here.

355
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,547
- Right.
- So, what are they doing here?

356
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,774
Hey, give the lady a cigar.

357
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,160
All right, seriously, does
looking at this nightmare

358
00:19:33,161 --> 00:19:35,771
Through that camera make you
feel better or something? I mean...

359
00:19:38,475 --> 00:19:41,003
Well, yeah. Uh, yeah. I think so.

360
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,960
Freeman daggett, house's last owner,

361
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:05,630
Officially commended
for 20 years of fine service

362
00:20:05,631 --> 00:20:07,810
At the gamble general hospital.

363
00:20:07,811 --> 00:20:09,183
He's a doctor?

364
00:20:09,403 --> 00:20:10,851
Janitor.

365
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,559
This looks like his den.

366
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:15,420
When'd you say he died, 64?

367
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:18,298
- Yeah, heart attack.
- What are these, c-Rations?

368
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:20,469
Yeah, army-Issued, three squares...

369
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,738
Like a lifetime supply.

370
00:20:23,349 --> 00:20:25,618
God, is that all he ate?

371
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:27,358
One-Stop shopping.

372
00:20:29,254 --> 00:20:30,707
Hello. Locked.

373
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,180
Oh, come on, guys. This is ridiculous.

374
00:20:32,181 --> 00:20:34,848
I mean, how the hell is this
supposed to find corbett, huh?

375
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:37,452
We should be digging up the
friggin' floorboards right now.

376
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:42,427
"Survival under atomic attack."

377
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:44,301
An optimist.

378
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,460
Crap. Crap.

379
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,525
Taxidermy. Okay.

380
00:21:05,526 --> 00:21:07,542
You said daggett was a hospital janitor?

381
00:21:07,543 --> 00:21:08,737
Yeah.

382
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,137
Got three toe tags here...

383
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:14,599
One, death by gunshots,

384
00:21:14,728 --> 00:21:17,010
Train accident, and suicide.

385
00:21:20,034 --> 00:21:21,496
What?

386
00:21:22,003 --> 00:21:24,955
Well, that explains why all
the death echoes are here.

387
00:21:27,021 --> 00:21:30,550
They're here because
their bodies are here

388
00:21:31,103 --> 00:21:33,591
Somewhere in the house.

389
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:39,070
Daggett brought the remains
home from the morgue to play.

390
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:49,420
Wait a minute.

391
00:22:10,508 --> 00:22:12,504
Closer to the herd, okay?

392
00:22:13,444 --> 00:22:14,907
She's fine.

393
00:22:14,908 --> 00:22:18,607
Harry. Harry, i got an 8.6 and climbing
fast. Something huge is coming.

394
00:22:18,608 --> 00:22:20,649
Look. Something big is coming.

395
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,110
It's past 11, you guys.

396
00:22:22,111 --> 00:22:23,668
What? Nobody move!

397
00:22:24,244 --> 00:22:26,212
Hold on. Hold on. Stay quiet.

398
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,007
It's really cold in here.

399
00:22:31,008 --> 00:22:33,399
Some kind of surge.

400
00:22:36,434 --> 00:22:37,937
Oh, no.

401
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:08,183
God, i am so scared.

402
00:23:09,032 --> 00:23:10,562
I'm so scared.

403
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:14,271
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay, maggie.

404
00:23:45,483 --> 00:23:47,328
My best friend...

405
00:23:48,348 --> 00:23:50,221
And my best sister.

406
00:23:51,996 --> 00:23:54,511
- Listen, ed.
- Are you banging my sister?

407
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,740
No!

408
00:23:56,741 --> 00:23:58,138
No!

409
00:23:58,936 --> 00:24:00,521
Hold my glasses.

410
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,450
What the are you doing?!

411
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,953
Cut it out!

412
00:24:14,163 --> 00:24:16,213
We're down by two people.

413
00:24:23,431 --> 00:24:24,989
Sorry.

414
00:24:27,268 --> 00:24:28,717
I'm sorry.

415
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,216
Give me my glasses.

416
00:24:33,298 --> 00:24:35,484
Did he knock my... my tooth there?

417
00:24:35,485 --> 00:24:36,910
Uh, no.

418
00:24:41,838 --> 00:24:43,314
Thanks, spruce.

419
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,902
Yeah, it's my fault.

420
00:24:44,903 --> 00:24:47,249
That's real great.
That's nice. Thanks.

421
00:25:04,718 --> 00:25:07,480
Hey, you got to keep
listening to my voice, okay?

422
00:25:07,861 --> 00:25:10,830
I'm right here. Stay awake.

423
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,707
Don't listen.

424
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:16,979
It stops hurting, so don't worry.

425
00:25:20,699 --> 00:25:22,681
Corbett, stay with me.

426
00:25:22,682 --> 00:25:26,468
Stay with me, you got it?
I'm right here. Hey. Stay with me.

427
00:25:26,469 --> 00:25:28,393
Don't. Don't.

428
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:29,660
No.

429
00:25:31,482 --> 00:25:32,835
No!

430
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,543
- Corbett! Where'd you guys go?
- Where are you guys?

431
00:25:50,242 --> 00:25:51,810
Dean, what are you doing?

432
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:53,950
So daggett was
a cold war nut, okay?

433
00:25:53,951 --> 00:25:56,321
He was... he was an
amateur taxidermist.

434
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:59,526
He liked to slow dance with cadavers,
and all he ate were c-Rations,

435
00:25:59,527 --> 00:26:01,864
- So what the hell are we looking for?!
- Horrible little life.

436
00:26:01,865 --> 00:26:03,399
Yeah, a lonely life.

437
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:05,749
A cold war life.

438
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,819
He was scared.

439
00:26:09,215 --> 00:26:11,314
- He was scared. He was scared.
- Scared of what?

440
00:26:11,315 --> 00:26:13,273
What? Dean, where are you going?

441
00:26:13,274 --> 00:26:15,160
Wait, don't leave me in here, you guys.

442
00:26:15,605 --> 00:26:16,950
Get away from me.

443
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:18,628
This won't hurt.

444
00:26:18,863 --> 00:26:20,326
It's okay.

445
00:26:20,526 --> 00:26:24,700
It's okay. Relax. Relax.

446
00:26:33,568 --> 00:26:35,873
- Where are you going?
- Guys like daggett back then,

447
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:37,895
The ones who were really
scared of the russkies...

448
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:40,851
They built bomb shelters.
I'm guessing he's got one.

449
00:26:41,598 --> 00:26:43,402
I'll bet you it's in the basement.

450
00:26:48,782 --> 00:26:50,914
Um, who closed the door?

451
00:26:50,915 --> 00:26:53,200
It did. It wants to separate us.

452
00:26:53,201 --> 00:26:54,630
- Ed! Listen to me!
- What?

453
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:58,149
There's some salt in my duffle.
Make a circle and get inside.

454
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,400
- Inside your duffle bag?
- In the salt, you idiot!

455
00:27:07,401 --> 00:27:09,189
Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah.

456
00:27:21,483 --> 00:27:24,353
Harry, hurry up. Get in
the circle. Get in the circle.

457
00:27:24,354 --> 00:27:26,575
Come on. Come on. Quick. Quick.

458
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:29,790
Guys, guys, i don't want to die,

459
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:31,399
And i don't want you to die.

460
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,520
Harry, listen...
listen to me, okay? Listen.

461
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:35,079
If we don't die...

462
00:27:36,107 --> 00:27:40,030
... it's totally okay
if you, uh, do my sister.

463
00:27:40,031 --> 00:27:41,709
Nice.

464
00:27:43,117 --> 00:27:45,710
Guys. It's coming again.

465
00:27:45,711 --> 00:27:48,240
My camera. Get in close.

466
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:50,775
Why does this keep happening?
Why does this keep happening?

467
00:27:56,531 --> 00:27:58,991
Oh, god. Oh, god.

468
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,792
Hey, can i ask you something?

469
00:28:08,806 --> 00:28:11,362
- What?
- Earlier, you and sam...

470
00:28:11,363 --> 00:28:13,378
He said you had two months left?

471
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:15,225
Yeah, it's complicated.

472
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:16,997
A while ago, sam...

473
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:19,850
No. No. No.

474
00:28:19,851 --> 00:28:22,610
I'm not gonna whine
about my problems

475
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,690
To some reality show.

476
00:28:24,691 --> 00:28:26,992
I'm gonna do my job.

477
00:28:28,981 --> 00:28:31,587
- Is it cancer?
- Shut up.

478
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:35,714
You hear that?

479
00:28:36,536 --> 00:28:39,269
I've been waiting
for some more friends.

480
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,043
I get lonely.

481
00:28:41,044 --> 00:28:43,656
But you're comin
to my party, aren't you?

482
00:28:43,657 --> 00:28:46,468
- Is that music?
- Yeah, it's coming from behind this wall.

483
00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:00,732
You're strong.

484
00:29:01,008 --> 00:29:03,468
You'll stay a good, long time.

485
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:46,050
Yeah?

486
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:48,500
Corbett's a... he's a death echo.

487
00:29:48,749 --> 00:29:51,277
He's reliving his own murder.

488
00:29:51,424 --> 00:29:53,816
Over and over forever.

489
00:29:58,104 --> 00:30:00,482
What's this daggett
guy's problem anyway?

490
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:03,500
Loneliness.
He's never heard of a realdoll?

491
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:06,080
No, no, no, daggett
was the norman bates,

492
00:30:06,081 --> 00:30:07,840
Stuff-Your-Mother kind of lonely.

493
00:30:07,841 --> 00:30:11,088
That's why he lifted these
bodies from the morgue,

494
00:30:11,089 --> 00:30:12,892
Threw himself a birthday party,

495
00:30:12,893 --> 00:30:14,996
Except they were the
only ones who would come.

496
00:30:14,997 --> 00:30:18,080
Anyway, so, at midnight,
he sealed them in the bomb shelter

497
00:30:18,081 --> 00:30:20,537
And went upstairs and
o.D.'D on horse tranqs.

498
00:30:20,538 --> 00:30:21,816
How do you know this?

499
00:30:22,001 --> 00:30:23,600
Cause he told me.

500
00:30:23,745 --> 00:30:25,010
Oh. Yeah.

501
00:30:25,215 --> 00:30:28,779
Okay, so now that he's dead, what?
Same song, different verse,

502
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,321
Trying to get people
to come to his party?

503
00:30:30,322 --> 00:30:32,418
Pretty much, yeah. Stay forever.

504
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:34,310
Are those real bullets?

505
00:30:34,461 --> 00:30:36,115
It's rock salt.

506
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,780
Oh, no.

507
00:30:52,781 --> 00:30:54,356
Oh, god.

508
00:30:58,226 --> 00:30:59,948
Wait, guys.

509
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:03,270
Guys, it's... it's corbett.

510
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,869
He's... he's... he's trapped.
He's in a lot of pain, you know?

511
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,581
We got to try and...

512
00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:12,232
We got to try and pull
him out of his loop.

513
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,174
We have to.

514
00:31:24,658 --> 00:31:26,736
- Oh, god.
- Don't cross the line of salt.

515
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:31,280
Corbett, listen to me.

516
00:31:31,684 --> 00:31:33,516
Okay, i'm not gonna hurt you.

517
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:34,957
Listen.

518
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,860
Listen. Oh, god. Corbett.

519
00:31:39,469 --> 00:31:41,090
Oh. Oh, god.

520
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,144
Oh, i can't, okay?

521
00:31:45,223 --> 00:31:46,932
He's not hearing me, okay?

522
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:48,691
He won't stop dying.

523
00:31:53,602 --> 00:31:55,950
Seriously... you're still shooting?

524
00:31:56,043 --> 00:31:58,449
It makes him feel better. Don't ask.

525
00:32:04,153 --> 00:32:05,711
Ah, hell, guys.

526
00:32:05,712 --> 00:32:07,970
Get in your ghost-Role thing.
Something's coming.

527
00:32:20,901 --> 00:32:23,197
I know how we can get through to him.

528
00:32:23,198 --> 00:32:24,434
How?

529
00:32:27,242 --> 00:32:29,292
He had feelings for you.

530
00:32:31,772 --> 00:32:33,849
He wanted you.

531
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,796
- Wanted me to what?
- You know.

532
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:41,775
And you know what you've got to do.

533
00:32:43,339 --> 00:32:44,952
You can do it, ed.

534
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:48,094
You've always been
the brave one. Yes, you can.

535
00:32:48,095 --> 00:32:50,134
You make us brave... maggie, right?

536
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,080
Yeah. I can do.

537
00:32:54,379 --> 00:32:57,509
You got to go be gay
for that poor, dead intern.

538
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,865
You got to send him into the light.

539
00:33:19,515 --> 00:33:21,170
Maggie, no. No.

540
00:33:21,171 --> 00:33:22,510
It's okay.

541
00:33:23,216 --> 00:33:25,061
Corbett, look.

542
00:33:25,062 --> 00:33:27,748
Hey, it's just ed, buddy. It's just me.

543
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,060
Hey, hey, corbett,
listen to me. Listen to me.

544
00:33:31,061 --> 00:33:33,106
I... we...

545
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:38,889
You meant...

546
00:33:40,243 --> 00:33:42,634
Corbett, you meant a lot to the team.

547
00:33:45,381 --> 00:33:46,820
You meant...

548
00:33:48,842 --> 00:33:50,714
You meant a lot to me.

549
00:33:50,715 --> 00:33:53,178
You know, never back down...

550
00:33:54,003 --> 00:33:56,067
Never say a bad word?

551
00:33:56,173 --> 00:33:59,621
I remember that, corbett.
I remember that.

552
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:02,013
I remember because
i love you, corbett.

553
00:34:02,517 --> 00:34:05,240
I really, truly love you.

554
00:34:08,863 --> 00:34:11,474
Do you remember that? Do you?

555
00:34:14,123 --> 00:34:15,500
Yeah.

556
00:34:16,538 --> 00:34:18,588
Yeah, corbett, it's...

557
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:22,540
Corbett, yeah, it's me.

558
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:25,531
It's me. Look at me.

559
00:34:27,683 --> 00:34:32,386
You got to help us, man. You have to
help us, corbett. Please. Please.

560
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:35,015
Please help us right now.

561
00:34:35,016 --> 00:34:36,792
Take it easy. You all right?

562
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,984
Uh, guys...

563
00:34:44,795 --> 00:34:46,830
This is bad... very bad.

564
00:35:05,191 --> 00:35:06,967
You all right, dude?

565
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:10,431
You all right?

566
00:35:16,297 --> 00:35:17,718
God.

567
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:39,140
Leap year, february 29th,
the morton house.

568
00:35:39,141 --> 00:35:41,038
A tragic day...

569
00:35:41,096 --> 00:35:44,430
A day of souls bound in torment,

570
00:35:44,431 --> 00:35:47,700
Of lives held in cruel balance.

571
00:35:48,511 --> 00:35:51,573
But the ghostfacers...
they did the best that they could.

572
00:35:52,427 --> 00:35:55,777
We lost a beloved friend,

573
00:35:56,269 --> 00:35:59,700
But we gained new allies.

574
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:01,399
We know this much...

575
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:04,893
That every day, including today,

576
00:36:04,894 --> 00:36:06,823
Is a new beginning.

577
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,030
We learned more than we can say

578
00:36:10,031 --> 00:36:12,675
In the brutal feat of the morton house.

579
00:36:13,244 --> 00:36:17,303
The ghostfacers were
forced to face something

580
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:20,955
Far more scary than ghosts.

581
00:36:21,316 --> 00:36:23,926
They were forced to face themselves.

582
00:36:24,939 --> 00:36:27,317
War changes man.

583
00:36:27,546 --> 00:36:29,350
And maggie.

584
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,320
War changes man...

585
00:36:34,243 --> 00:36:36,033
And one woman.

586
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:40,375
You know, corbett, we just...

587
00:36:41,597 --> 00:36:43,600
Oh, gosh, we just like to think

588
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,752
That you're out there watching over us.

589
00:36:45,753 --> 00:36:47,563
As far as we're concerned,

590
00:36:47,564 --> 00:36:49,691
You're not an intern anymore.

591
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,844
You have more than earned
full ghostfacer status.

592
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:56,428
Plus, it'd be cool to have
a ghost on the team.

593
00:36:56,429 --> 00:36:57,507
Yeah.

594
00:36:57,508 --> 00:36:58,889
You know, and here we were,

595
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:01,540
Thinking that, you know,
we were teaching you,

596
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,922
And all this time,
you were teaching us...

597
00:37:05,797 --> 00:37:07,670
About heart,

598
00:37:08,905 --> 00:37:11,220
About dedication, and...

599
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:18,030
About how gay love can pierce
through the veil of death

600
00:37:18,658 --> 00:37:20,599
And save the day.

601
00:37:21,951 --> 00:37:24,390
Thank you, alan j. Corbett.

602
00:37:25,253 --> 00:37:28,780
Go well into that
starry night, young turk.

603
00:37:30,854 --> 00:37:32,221
Go well.

604
00:37:40,142 --> 00:37:41,570
Come on, spruce.

605
00:37:41,571 --> 00:37:43,712
I got to get all this stuff packed up.

606
00:37:43,713 --> 00:37:45,698
So? Pack and talk.

607
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:48,445
- I don't know what to say.
- Say what comes to mind.

608
00:37:48,842 --> 00:37:51,002
This is one of our confessional
moments, corbett,

609
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:52,655
So confess.

610
00:37:52,656 --> 00:37:54,611
What do you think was
gonna happen tonight?

611
00:37:54,612 --> 00:37:57,509
What do you think's gonna
happen tonight on this trip?

612
00:37:58,933 --> 00:38:01,680
I think tonight... i really do...

613
00:38:02,158 --> 00:38:04,426
I think all our dream
are gonna come true.

614
00:38:06,102 --> 00:38:08,042
Does that sound stupid?

615
00:38:08,291 --> 00:38:10,273
Kind of does, yeah.

616
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:34,457
So, guys, what do you think?

617
00:38:35,429 --> 00:38:37,260
You all right?

618
00:38:37,696 --> 00:38:39,910
You know, i kind of think
it was half awesome.

619
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:42,995
Half awesome...
that's full-On good, right?

620
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,240
Yeah.

621
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:46,589
I mean, it's bizarre
how y'all are able to...

622
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:50,532
To honor corbett's memory while grossly
exploiting the manner of his death. Well done.

623
00:38:50,533 --> 00:38:53,380
Yeah, that's a real tight
rope you guys are walking.

624
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:55,619
Yeah. All right, guys.

625
00:38:57,276 --> 00:39:00,320
No, that's reality, man. Yeah.

626
00:39:00,321 --> 00:39:02,321
Corbett gave his life
searching for the truth,

627
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,789
And it is our job over here
to share it with the world.

628
00:39:06,092 --> 00:39:09,057
Right. Well, um, our experience...

629
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,039
You know what you get when you
show the world the truth?

630
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,230
A straightjacket or
a punch in the face...

631
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:14,510
- Sometimes both.
- Right.

632
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,430
Oh, come on, guys,
don't be 'facer haters

633
00:39:16,431 --> 00:39:19,683
Because we happen to have gotten
the footage of the century.

634
00:39:19,684 --> 00:39:20,976
Oh, yeah.

635
00:39:23,545 --> 00:39:25,120
- You got us there.
- Yeah.

636
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:27,676
Yeah, well, we'll see
you guys around.

637
00:39:38,091 --> 00:39:39,389
Dicks.

638
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,966
Oh, yeah.

639
00:39:41,928 --> 00:39:43,670
Start laying off some dvds.

640
00:39:43,671 --> 00:39:46,079
Sounds like a good idea, spruce.

641
00:39:46,162 --> 00:39:48,608
You know, guys, i think we're gonna
need a bigger office here, you know,

642
00:39:48,609 --> 00:39:50,221
Cause we're gonna go national,

643
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:52,766
And then it's gonna go
international, and then...

644
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:55,317
Hey, menudo left their
dance bag behind.

645
00:39:56,196 --> 00:39:57,980
What's inside, huh?

646
00:40:01,668 --> 00:40:03,554
What the hell is this?

647
00:40:03,555 --> 00:40:07,410
Uh, i seem to be having some
technical difficulty over here.

648
00:40:08,476 --> 00:40:10,220
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

649
00:40:10,221 --> 00:40:11,782
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

650
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,898
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

651
00:40:12,899 --> 00:40:14,989
"No operating system found"?
Wait a minute.

652
00:40:16,449 --> 00:40:17,550
We clean?

653
00:40:17,551 --> 00:40:19,087
No-O-O-O-O-O-O!

654
00:40:24,936 --> 00:40:27,560
Electromagnet wiped out every
tape and hard drive they have.

655
00:40:27,561 --> 00:40:29,624
World just isn't ready
for the ghostfacers.

656
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:32,359
That's too bad.
I kind of liked the show.

657
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,440
Had its moments.
