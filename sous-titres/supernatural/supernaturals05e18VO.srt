1
00:00:01,541 --> 00:00:03,520
I was on the fast track once.

2
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:06,298
Employee of the month
every month... Forever.

3
00:00:06,664 --> 00:00:08,091
And then they assigned me you.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,724
I can't close the deal on a couple
of pathetic, flannel-wearing maggots?

5
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:14,097
Everybody's laughing at me.

6
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,952
- We're John Winchester's sons.
- I've got brothers?

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,210
- Adam doesn't have to be cursed.
- He's a Winchester.

8
00:00:19,377 --> 00:00:20,619
He's already cursed.

9
00:00:21,872 --> 00:00:25,266
You're not Adam.
You've never been Adam.

10
00:00:25,742 --> 00:00:27,068
You're a ghoul.

11
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:30,080
You can't kill the devil,
and you're losing faith

12
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:34,140
In yourself, your brother.
God was your last hope.

13
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,628
- Are you gonna do something stupid?
- Like what?

14
00:00:36,795 --> 00:00:38,038
Like Michael stupid.

15
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:40,165
Whatever you're thinking of doing,
don't do it.

16
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,625
I have to.

17
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,325
Let me guess.

18
00:00:57,801 --> 00:01:00,947
- Pink-slipped?
- That obvious?

19
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:04,276
Takes one to know one.

20
00:01:06,669 --> 00:01:07,796
"Outsourcing."

21
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,071
What was your crime
against humanity?

22
00:01:15,265 --> 00:01:16,606
Deal of the millennum.

23
00:01:17,332 --> 00:01:20,298
Couldn't even get the one
simple "yes" I needed.

24
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:22,867
Got to nail that bottom line, right?

25
00:01:23,921 --> 00:01:24,835
Hear that.

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,864
All they care
about upstairs, ain't it?

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,542
Results, results, results.

28
00:01:29,582 --> 00:01:30,635
They don't know.

29
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,909
They're not down on the ground,
in the mud,

30
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:35,151
Nose to nose
with all you pig-filthy humans.

31
00:01:35,276 --> 00:01:36,091
Am I right?

32
00:01:36,216 --> 00:01:37,722
Absolutely... filthy what?

33
00:01:38,088 --> 00:01:40,725
I mean, whatever happened
to personal loyalty?

34
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:42,835
How long have I worked
for these guys?

35
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,889
Five millennia?
Six?

36
00:01:45,892 --> 00:01:48,048
- Seems like it, don't it?
- Damn straight, it does.

37
00:01:49,355 --> 00:01:50,720
Two more.

38
00:01:52,726 --> 00:01:54,672
- Zach.
- Stuart.

39
00:01:56,537 --> 00:01:58,069
What are you gonna do next, Stuart?

40
00:01:58,194 --> 00:01:59,543
Hell, I don't know.

41
00:02:00,464 --> 00:02:02,231
Maybe something to do
with the Internet.

42
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:03,285
Yeah?

43
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,840
Earthquake?

44
00:02:09,886 --> 00:02:10,618
No.

45
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:13,098
My boss.

46
00:02:27,757 --> 00:02:28,676
Go ahead.

47
00:02:29,486 --> 00:02:30,945
Get it over with.

48
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:32,304
I'm ready.

49
00:02:40,087 --> 00:02:41,064
Wait

50
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:42,179
What?

51
00:02:43,105 --> 00:02:45,066
Yes!
Anything. Of course.

52
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:47,124
Just... put me back in.
You won't regret it.

53
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:52,869
Thank you.

54
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:54,479
Thank you!

55
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,360
Back in business, boys!

56
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:23,063
= 518 =

57
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:27,164
= Supernatural Team =

58
00:04:41,424 --> 00:04:43,585
Sending someone a candygram?

59
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:51,890
How'd you find me?

60
00:04:52,441 --> 00:04:54,119
You're gonna kill yourself, right?

61
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,796
It's not too hard to figure out
the stops on the farewell tour.

62
00:04:58,515 --> 00:05:00,720
How's Lisa doing, anyway?

63
00:05:01,822 --> 00:05:04,153
- I'm not gonna kill myself.
- No?

64
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:07,544
So, Michael's not about
to make you his muppet?

65
00:05:09,022 --> 00:05:11,414
What the hell, man?
This is how it ends?

66
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:13,604
You just... Walk out?

67
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,733
- Yeah, I guess.
- How could you do that?

68
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,152
How could I?

69
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:23,001
All you've ever done is run away!

70
00:05:23,126 --> 00:05:26,430
And I was wrong
every single time I did.

71
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:33,165
Just... Please...

72
00:05:34,278 --> 00:05:36,903
Not now.
Bobby is working on something.

73
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,463
Oh, really?
What?

74
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,816
You got nothing, and you know it.

75
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,724
You know I have to stop you.

76
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:57,202
Yeah, well, you can try.

77
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,513
But just remember, you're not all
hopped up on demon blood this time.

78
00:06:03,384 --> 00:06:04,699
Yeah, I know.

79
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:07,408
But I brought help.

80
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:19,983
Yeah, no, this is good, really.

81
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:23,127
Eight months of turned pages
and screwed pooches.

82
00:06:23,252 --> 00:06:25,551
But tonight... tonight's
when the magic happens.

83
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:27,167
You ain't helping.

84
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:29,584
Why don't you let me
get out of your hair, then?

85
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:34,047
What the hell happened to you?

86
00:06:34,172 --> 00:06:35,249
Reality happened.

87
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:37,271
Nuclear's the only option
we have left.

88
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,135
Michael can ice the devil,
save a boatload of people.

89
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,664
But not all of them.

90
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:43,860
We got to think of something else.

91
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:48,432
That's easy for you to say.
But if Lucifer burns this mother down

92
00:06:48,557 --> 00:06:50,486
and I could have done
something about it.

93
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:51,967
Guess what... that's on me.

94
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,497
You can't give up, son.

95
00:06:58,038 --> 00:06:59,251
You're not my father.

96
00:07:01,865 --> 00:07:03,380
And you ain't in my shoes.

97
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:29,741
What is that?

98
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,986
That's the round
I mean to put through my skull.

99
00:07:36,192 --> 00:07:37,934
Every morning, I look at it,

100
00:07:38,722 --> 00:07:39,792
And I think...

101
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,770
"Maybe today's the day
I flip the lights out."

102
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,130
But I don't do it.

103
00:07:47,954 --> 00:07:50,038
I never do it.
You know why?

104
00:07:51,576 --> 00:07:54,932
Because I promised you
I wouldn't give up!

105
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:06,607
Cass, you okay?

106
00:08:07,355 --> 00:08:08,078
No.

107
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:10,252
What's wrong?

108
00:08:11,955 --> 00:08:13,117
Something's happening.

109
00:08:14,316 --> 00:08:15,231
Where?

110
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,669
I'm gonna get a beer.
Do you mind?

111
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:40,919
Help.

112
00:10:41,044 --> 00:10:42,184
Boys!

113
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:50,141
Who is it?

114
00:10:53,132 --> 00:10:54,335
That's our brother.

115
00:11:02,248 --> 00:11:03,751


116
00:11:05,272 --> 00:11:07,940
Wait a minute.
Your brother? Adam?

117
00:11:08,854 --> 00:11:10,307
Cass, what the hell?

118
00:11:12,675 --> 00:11:13,764
Angels.

119
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,549
Angels? Why?

120
00:11:17,414 --> 00:11:19,093
I know one thing for sure.

121
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:22,650
We need to hide him now.

122
00:11:33,947 --> 00:11:35,400
Where am I?
It's okay.

123
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:37,735
- Just relax. You're safe.
- Who the hell are you?

124
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,223
You're gonna find this a little...

125
00:11:41,175 --> 00:11:44,074
A lot crazy, but we're
actually your brothers.

126
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:46,047
It's the truth.

127
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,032
John Winchester was our father, too.

128
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:51,301
- See, I'm Sam.
- And I'm sure that's Dean.

129
00:11:53,443 --> 00:11:54,691
I know who you are.

130
00:11:55,054 --> 00:11:56,889
- How?
- They warned me about you.

131
00:11:57,014 --> 00:11:58,717
- Who did?
- The angels.

132
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:04,095
Now, where the hell is Zachariah?!

133
00:12:07,214 --> 00:12:09,074
So, why don't you just
tell us everything?

134
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:10,753
Start from the beginning.

135
00:12:15,432 --> 00:12:18,789
Well, I was dead and in heaven...

136
00:12:20,336 --> 00:12:24,201
Except it...
kind of looked like my prom.

137
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:28,675
And I was making out with this girl.
Her name was Kristin McGee.

138
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,422
That sounds like heaven.

139
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:32,201
Did you get to third base?

140
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:36,088
Just... Just keep going.

141
00:12:37,493 --> 00:12:40,024
These angels,
they popped out of nowhere,

142
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:41,760
and they tell me that I'm chosen.

143
00:12:42,084 --> 00:12:44,596
- For what?
- To save the world.

144
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,565
How you gonna do that?

145
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,335
Me and some archangel
are gonna kill the devil.

146
00:12:50,878 --> 00:12:52,813
- What archangel?
- Michael.

147
00:12:53,477 --> 00:12:57,166
I'm his sword or vessel or something.
I don't know.

148
00:12:58,756 --> 00:12:59,944
That's insane.

149
00:13:00,732 --> 00:13:02,060
Not necessarily.

150
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:04,182
How do you mean?

151
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:06,945
Maybe they're moving
on from you, Dean.

152
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:09,475
That doesn't make sense.

153
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,164
He's John Winchester's bloodline,

154
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:12,983
Sam's brother.

155
00:13:14,497 --> 00:13:17,087
- It's not perfect, but it's possible.
- You got to be kidding me.

156
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,798
- Why would they do this?
- Maybe they're desperate.

157
00:13:20,082 --> 00:13:21,318
Maybey've wrongly assumed

158
00:13:21,443 --> 00:13:23,415
Dean would be brave enough
to withstand them.

159
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,438
- You know what? Blow me, Cass.
- Look. No way.

160
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,775
After everything that's happened.

161
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,018
All that crap about destiny,
suddenly the angels have a plan "b"?

162
00:13:32,987 --> 00:13:34,459
Does that smell right to anybody?

163
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:36,857
You know, tis has been
a really moving family reunion.

164
00:13:37,104 --> 00:13:40,962
- But, I got a thing, so...
- Whoa, no. Sit down.

165
00:13:41,631 --> 00:13:43,170
Just listen, okay?

166
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:46,172
Please.

167
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:51,665
It's unbelievable.

168
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,753
Now, Adam...

169
00:13:56,362 --> 00:13:58,880
The angels are lying to you.

170
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,640
They're full of crap.

171
00:14:01,304 --> 00:14:02,569
Yeah, I don't think so.

172
00:14:02,694 --> 00:14:05,093
Really? Why not?

173
00:14:05,218 --> 00:14:06,815
'cause they're angels.

174
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,281
They tell you they were gonna
roast half the planet?

175
00:14:10,406 --> 00:14:12,208
They said the fight
might get pretty hairy

176
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,376
but it is the devil, right?
So, we got to stop him.

177
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:16,493
Yeah, but there's another way.

178
00:14:19,055 --> 00:14:20,508
Great. What is it?

179
00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:22,336
We're working on the power of love.

180
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:25,894
- How's that going?
- Not good.

181
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:27,073
Look, Adam...

182
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,659
You don't know me from a hole
in the wall, I know,

183
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:31,982
but I'm begging you.

184
00:14:32,107 --> 00:14:33,788
Please, just trust me.

185
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:36,353
Give me some time.

186
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,257
Give me one good reason.

187
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:43,487
Because we're blood.

188
00:14:46,643 --> 00:14:48,334
You got no right to say that to me.

189
00:14:48,948 --> 00:14:50,458
You're still John's boy.

190
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,073
No, John Winchester was some guy

191
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:54,090
who took me to a baseball game
once a year.

192
00:14:54,215 --> 00:14:55,531
I didn't have a dad.

193
00:14:57,134 --> 00:14:59,595
So, we may be blood,
but we are not family.

194
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,207
My mom is my family,

195
00:15:02,332 --> 00:15:05,226
and if I do my job,
I get to see her again.

196
00:15:06,585 --> 00:15:09,032
So, no offense, but she's the one
I give a rat's ass about,

197
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,200
Not you.

198
00:15:15,973 --> 00:15:16,975
Fair enough.

199
00:15:18,873 --> 00:15:21,954
But if you have one good
memory of dad... just one...

200
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,484
Then you'll give us
a little more time.

201
00:15:24,948 --> 00:15:26,088
Please.

202
00:16:02,957 --> 00:16:04,348
Going somewhere?

203
00:16:08,212 --> 00:16:09,843
Out for a beer.

204
00:16:10,204 --> 00:16:12,137
Great. We got beer.
Have a seat.

205
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:13,987
Great.

206
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,797
You know, you pitch this whole
dewy-eyed bromance thing,

207
00:16:18,922 --> 00:16:21,115
but the truh is,
I'm on lockdown, aren't I?

208
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,762
Adam...

209
00:16:27,816 --> 00:16:29,454
You may not believe it,

210
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:33,034
but dad was trying to protect you,
keeping you from all this.

211
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,993
I guess the monster that ate me
didn't get that memo.

212
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,022
You remember that?

213
00:16:39,554 --> 00:16:40,619
Oh, yeah.

214
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:43,807
Still, trust me,

215
00:16:43,932 --> 00:16:46,043
the oning worse
than seeing dad once a year

216
00:16:46,782 --> 00:16:48,025
was seeing him all year.

217
00:16:48,821 --> 00:16:50,530
Do you know how full
of crap you are?

218
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,953
- What?
- Really.

219
00:16:52,965 --> 00:16:55,821
You see, it was me,
and it was my mom, that's it.

220
00:16:56,923 --> 00:16:58,877
She worked the graveyard shift
at the hospital.

221
00:16:59,002 --> 00:17:01,667
I cooked my own dinners.
I put myself to bed.

222
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,967
So, you can say whatever
you want about our dad,

223
00:17:04,092 --> 00:17:06,307
but the truth is,
I would have taken anything.

224
00:17:08,452 --> 00:17:09,403
All right?

225
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:13,031
Look, if we had known
we had a brother...

226
00:17:13,335 --> 00:17:15,846
- You didn't, so...
- ... we would have found you.

227
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:19,070
I can't change the past.

228
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:20,997
I wish I could.

229
00:17:21,532 --> 00:17:24,315
- But from here on out...
- What?

230
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,645
We gonna hop
in the family truckster?

231
00:17:26,883 --> 00:17:28,549
Pop on down to Wally world?

232
00:17:31,771 --> 00:17:33,350
Tell you one thing...

233
00:17:33,475 --> 00:17:35,116
Attitude like that,

234
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:37,734
you'd fit right in around here.

235
00:17:57,017 --> 00:17:58,324
Cass, not for nothing,

236
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:00,393
but the last person
who looked at me like that...

237
00:18:00,744 --> 00:18:01,784
I got laid.

238
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:05,333
Why don't you go keep
an eye on Adam?

239
00:18:11,662 --> 00:18:13,268
Is this really necessary?

240
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:16,111
We got our hands full, Dean...

241
00:18:16,775 --> 00:18:19,848
- A houseful of flight risks.
- I'm not letting him do it.

242
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,247
Who, Adam?
No, I'm... I'm not, either.

243
00:18:22,489 --> 00:18:26,447
- No, you're not getting me.
- No, I "get" you perfectly.

244
00:18:27,503 --> 00:18:29,344
But I'm not
letting you do it, either.

245
00:18:36,685 --> 00:18:38,382
That kid's not
taking a bullet for me.

246
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,186
- Dean...
- I'm serious.

247
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:44,038
Think abouw many people
we've gotten killed, Sam.

248
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:48,463
Mom, dad...

249
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:51,607
Jess, jo, Ellen.

250
00:18:52,724 --> 00:18:53,949
Should I keep going?

251
00:18:54,463 --> 00:18:56,198
It's not like we pulled the trigger.

252
00:18:56,574 --> 00:18:57,901
We might as well have.

253
00:19:01,017 --> 00:19:02,344
I'm tired, man.

254
00:19:04,837 --> 00:19:07,330
I'm tired of fighting
who I'm supposed to be.

255
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,086
Do you think maybe you could
take a half a second

256
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:15,221
and stop trying to sacrifice
yourself for a change?

257
00:19:15,346 --> 00:19:17,293
Maybe we could actually
stick together?

258
00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:20,033
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

259
00:19:21,348 --> 00:19:22,864
Dean, seriously.

260
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:24,204
Tell me.
I want to know.

261
00:19:26,205 --> 00:19:27,528
I just...

262
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:30,492
I don't believe.

263
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:31,584
In what?

264
00:19:36,605 --> 00:19:37,383
In you.

265
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:43,434
I mean, I don't...

266
00:19:45,028 --> 00:19:47,047
I don't know whether
it's gonna be demon blood

267
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:52,137
or some other demon chick
or what, but...

268
00:19:54,828 --> 00:19:57,070
I do know they're gonna
find a way to turn you.

269
00:19:59,303 --> 00:20:01,056
So, you're saying
I'm not strong enough.

270
00:20:01,181 --> 00:20:04,258
You're angry, you're self-righteous.

271
00:20:05,766 --> 00:20:07,525
Lucifer's gonna wear you
to the prom, man.

272
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,046
- It's just a matter of time.
- Don't say that to me.

273
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:12,510
Not you...

274
00:20:13,397 --> 00:20:14,739
Of all people.

275
00:20:16,588 --> 00:20:17,570
I don't want to.

276
00:20:20,934 --> 00:20:22,303
But it's the truth.

277
00:20:23,534 --> 00:20:24,974
And when Satan takes you over,

278
00:20:25,528 --> 00:20:27,683
There's got to be
somebody there to fight him,

279
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,523
and it ain't gonna be that kid.

280
00:20:33,802 --> 00:20:34,983
So, it's got to be me.

281
00:20:56,044 --> 00:20:57,088
How's he doing?

282
00:21:01,944 --> 00:21:02,969
How you doing?

283
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,086


284
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,534
Where's Cass?

285
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:27,949
Blown to Oz.

286
00:22:28,074 --> 00:22:30,431
Look, I'll get Dean.
He couldn't have gone too far.

287
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:32,713
- Watch Adam.
- How?

288
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,852
He's got a slight height advantage.

289
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,282
Then cuff him to your chair.
I don't know. Just watch him.

290
00:22:59,475 --> 00:23:01,575
Your mom's not coming, you know.

291
00:23:07,498 --> 00:23:10,179
This is the park where your mom
took you on her day off, right?

292
00:23:12,296 --> 00:23:14,225
She's not coming. Not yet.

293
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,634
But she will... Soon.

294
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,966
You're Zachariah, right?

295
00:23:23,428 --> 00:23:24,428
I am.

296
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:28,683
You weren't
where you were supposed to be, kid.

297
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:31,701
- I know.
- Can't quite zero in on you, either.

298
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,690
So, let me take a wild guess.

299
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:37,248
You're with Sam and Dean?

300
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,953
Didn't we tell you about them?

301
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,345
So, you know you can't trust them?

302
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,570
You know Sam and Dean Winchester

303
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:52,395
are psychotically, irrationally,
erotically

304
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,141
codependent on each other?

305
00:23:56,543 --> 00:23:57,693
I don't know.

306
00:23:58,683 --> 00:24:00,438
They said a few things about you.

307
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,191
Really?

308
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,511
Trust me, when the heat gets hot,

309
00:24:06,636 --> 00:24:08,606
theywon't give a flying crap
about you.

310
00:24:08,731 --> 00:24:11,887
They'd rather save each other's
sweet bacon than save the planet.

311
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,747
They're not your family.

312
00:24:18,994 --> 00:24:20,044
Understand?

313
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,980
Now...

314
00:24:27,045 --> 00:24:29,212
You want to see your mom again
or not?

315
00:24:36,904 --> 00:24:38,204
The end is nigh!

316
00:24:39,196 --> 00:24:40,996
The apocalypse is upon us!

317
00:24:42,554 --> 00:24:44,154
The angels talk to me,

318
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:47,029
and they asked me to talk to you!

319
00:24:47,164 --> 00:24:48,514
The apocalypse...

320
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,630
- I'm Dean Winchester. Know who I am?
- Dear God!

321
00:24:54,774 --> 00:24:56,114
I'll take that as a yes.

322
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:59,079
I need you to pray to your buddies
and let them know I'm here.

323
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:04,127
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

324
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,980
You pray too loud.

325
00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:12,552
- What, are you crazy?
- I rebelled for this?

326
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:17,014
So that you could surrender to them?

327
00:25:22,957 --> 00:25:24,107
Cass! Please!

328
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:30,736
I gave everything for you.
And this is what you give to me!

329
00:25:51,701 --> 00:25:52,701
Do it.

330
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:55,895
Just do it!

331
00:26:14,702 --> 00:26:17,152
Bobby, what do you mean,
Adam is gone?

332
00:26:17,644 --> 00:26:20,494
- Should I say it in Spanish?
- He's gone how?

333
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:24,165
- What the hell, Bobby?
- Watch your tone, boy.

334
00:26:25,128 --> 00:26:28,747
He was right in front of me,
and he disappeared into thin air.

335
00:26:28,872 --> 00:26:30,772
Because the angels took him.

336
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,720
- What the hell happened to him?
- Me.

337
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,682
What do you mean,
the angels took Adam?

338
00:26:42,237 --> 00:26:43,808
You branded his ribs, didn't you?

339
00:26:43,933 --> 00:26:46,033
Yes. Adam must have tipped them.

340
00:26:46,677 --> 00:26:48,327
- How?
- I don't know.

341
00:26:49,592 --> 00:26:52,526
- Maybe in a dream.
- Well, where would they have taken him?

342
00:27:04,755 --> 00:27:07,458
I see you and your brother
share the same refined palate.

343
00:27:13,446 --> 00:27:14,446
We ready?

344
00:27:15,606 --> 00:27:16,606
For what?

345
00:27:16,731 --> 00:27:18,427
What do you mean? For Michael.

346
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:23,516
About that...

347
00:27:24,095 --> 00:27:26,795
Look, this is never easy,
but I'm afraid...

348
00:27:27,034 --> 00:27:29,730
We've had to terminate your position
at this time.

349
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,034
- Excuse me?
- Don't get me wrong,

350
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:35,236
you've been a hell of a sport...
Good stuff.

351
00:27:36,044 --> 00:27:39,944
But the thing is, you're not so much
the "chosen one" as you are...

352
00:27:41,383 --> 00:27:42,868
A clammy scrap of bait.

353
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,216
What about the stuff that you said?

354
00:27:45,341 --> 00:27:47,000
I'm supposed to fight the devil.

355
00:27:48,353 --> 00:27:49,566
If it's any consolation,

356
00:27:49,691 --> 00:27:52,805
you happen to be the illegitimate half
brother of the guy we do care about.

357
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,530
That's not bad, is it?

358
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:56,355
So, you lied...

359
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,843
- About everything.
- We didn't lie.

360
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,570
We just avoided certain truths
to manipulate you.

361
00:28:01,695 --> 00:28:02,930
You son of a bitch.

362
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,440
How do you think I feel?

363
00:28:04,565 --> 00:28:06,976
I got to put up
with that dumb look on your face!

364
00:28:09,987 --> 00:28:11,937
Kid, we didn't have a choice.

365
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:15,359
The Winchesters got one blind spot,
and it's family.

366
00:28:16,747 --> 00:28:19,754
See, Sam and Dean, they're gonna
put aside their differences,

367
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:22,450
they're gonna come get you,
and that's gonna put Dean right...

368
00:28:23,899 --> 00:28:24,899
Here.

369
00:28:25,448 --> 00:28:26,495
Where I need him.

370
00:28:28,536 --> 00:28:30,186
This is the night, kid!

371
00:28:30,846 --> 00:28:31,846
Our night.

372
00:28:32,804 --> 00:28:34,026
Michael's seen it.

373
00:28:34,151 --> 00:28:36,493
The tumblers
finally click into place,

374
00:28:36,618 --> 00:28:38,341
and it's all because of you.

375
00:28:39,144 --> 00:28:42,428
- And me. But who's keeping score?
- I'm not gonna let you do this.

376
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,597
Cool your jets, Corky. Sit down.

377
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,068
We're doing it together.

378
00:28:46,193 --> 00:28:48,120
Plus, you still get your severance.

379
00:28:48,245 --> 00:28:50,545
You still get to see your mom, okay?

380
00:28:51,445 --> 00:28:53,105
Why should I believe you?

381
00:28:54,928 --> 00:28:56,128
You know what?

382
00:28:56,915 --> 00:28:58,415
I keep hearing this.

383
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,863
But what I wanna be hearing is this.

384
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,276
That's better.

385
00:29:13,928 --> 00:29:15,228
How you feeling?

386
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,730
Word to the wise...

387
00:29:22,607 --> 00:29:24,387
Don't piss off the nerd angels.

388
00:29:27,742 --> 00:29:28,891
So, how's it going?

389
00:29:31,782 --> 00:29:32,812
Adam's gone.

390
00:29:33,128 --> 00:29:35,228
- The angels have him.
- Where?

391
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:38,484
- The room where they took you.
- You sure?

392
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,770
- Cass did a recon.
- And?

393
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,013
The place is crawling with mooks.

394
00:29:44,138 --> 00:29:46,784
Pretty much a no-shot-in-hell,
hail-Mary kind of thing.

395
00:29:47,795 --> 00:29:48,945
So the usual.

396
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,880
What are you gonna do?

397
00:29:52,205 --> 00:29:53,374
For starters...

398
00:29:53,909 --> 00:29:55,509
I'm bringing you with.

399
00:29:56,244 --> 00:29:57,244
Excuse me?

400
00:29:57,787 --> 00:29:59,541
There are too many of them.

401
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:00,897
We can't do it alone,

402
00:30:01,022 --> 00:30:03,822
and you're pretty much
the only game in town.

403
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,476
Isn't that a bad idea?

404
00:30:12,931 --> 00:30:15,531
Cass and Bobby think so.
I'm not so sure.

405
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,790
Well, they're right.

406
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:22,403
Because either it's a trap
to get me there, to make me say yes,

407
00:30:22,998 --> 00:30:25,239
or it's not a trap
and I'm gonna say yes anyway.

408
00:30:26,196 --> 00:30:28,451
And I will.
I'll do it... Fair warning.

409
00:30:30,108 --> 00:30:31,308
No, you won't.

410
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,798
When push shoves,
you'll make the right call.

411
00:30:40,587 --> 00:30:42,787
You know, if tables were turned...

412
00:30:42,912 --> 00:30:44,300
I'd let you rot in here.

413
00:30:44,871 --> 00:30:46,469
Hell, I have let you rot in here.

414
00:30:51,144 --> 00:30:52,558
I guess i'm not that smart.

415
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:56,520
I don't get it.
Sam, why are you doing this?

416
00:31:00,577 --> 00:31:01,577
Because...

417
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:05,878
You're still my big brother.

418
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:13,496


419
00:31:20,602 --> 00:31:22,963
- Where the hell are we?
- Van Nuys, California.

420
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,439
- Where's the beautiful room?
- In there.

421
00:31:27,069 --> 00:31:29,803
The beautiful room is in an abandoned
muffler factory in Van Nuys?

422
00:31:30,509 --> 00:31:32,973
- Where'd you think it was?
- I don't know. Jupiter?

423
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,589
A blade of grass? Not Van Nuys.

424
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,938
Why don't you just grab Adam
and shazam the hell out of there?

425
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:41,482
Because there are at least
five angels in there.

426
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,000
- So? You're fast.
- They're faster.

427
00:31:46,568 --> 00:31:49,448
I'll clear them out.
You two grab the boy.

428
00:31:50,057 --> 00:31:52,660
- This is our only chance.
- You're gonna take on five angels?

429
00:31:54,893 --> 00:31:55,893
Yes.

430
00:31:56,596 --> 00:31:58,946
- Isn't that suicide?
- Maybe it is.

431
00:31:59,071 --> 00:32:01,621
But then
I won't have to watch you fail.

432
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,850
I'm sorry, Dean.

433
00:32:04,663 --> 00:32:07,091
I don't have the same faith in you
that Sam does.

434
00:32:13,274 --> 00:32:14,890
What are you gonna do with that?

435
00:33:38,745 --> 00:33:39,975
What are you waiting for?

436
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:41,851
Come on.

437
00:34:49,085 --> 00:34:50,385
You came for me.

438
00:34:51,068 --> 00:34:53,298
- You're family.
- Dean, it's a trap.

439
00:34:53,867 --> 00:34:54,867
I figured.

440
00:34:56,299 --> 00:34:58,510
Did you really think
it would be that easy?

441
00:34:58,904 --> 00:34:59,904
Did you?

442
00:35:06,223 --> 00:35:08,522
You know what I've learned
from this experience, Dean?

443
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:11,367
Patience.

444
00:35:15,725 --> 00:35:18,600
- Let him go, you son of a bitch.
- I thought I was downsized for sure,

445
00:35:18,725 --> 00:35:21,368
And for us, a firing...
Pretty damn literal.

446
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:25,871
But I should have trusted
the boss man.

447
00:35:25,996 --> 00:35:28,041
It's all playing out like he said...

448
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:30,753
You, me, your hemorrhaging brothers.

449
00:35:37,941 --> 00:35:39,344
You're finally ready.

450
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,143
You know
there's never been a choice.

451
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,161
Stop it. Stop it right now!

452
00:35:49,817 --> 00:35:51,023
In exchange for what?

453
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:54,727
Damn it, Zachariah.

454
00:35:56,974 --> 00:35:58,274
Stop it, please.

455
00:36:02,464 --> 00:36:03,514
I'll do it.

456
00:36:04,926 --> 00:36:06,676
I'm sorry. What was that?

457
00:36:10,214 --> 00:36:11,214
Okay, yes.

458
00:36:13,289 --> 00:36:14,689
The answer is yes.

459
00:36:16,712 --> 00:36:17,962
Do you hear me?

460
00:36:19,067 --> 00:36:21,117
Call Michael down, you bastard!

461
00:36:28,558 --> 00:36:31,279
- How do I know you're not lying?
- Do I look like I'm lying?

462
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,210
He's coming.

463
00:37:08,383 --> 00:37:10,633
Of course, I have a few conditions.

464
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:17,317
A few people whose safety
you have to guarantee before I say yes.

465
00:37:18,371 --> 00:37:21,271
- Sure, fine. Make a list.
- But most of all...

466
00:37:23,257 --> 00:37:25,868
Michael can't have me
until he disintegrates you.

467
00:37:27,352 --> 00:37:29,452
- What did you say?
- I said...

468
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:33,901
Before Michael gets one piece
of this sweet ass...

469
00:37:34,892 --> 00:37:36,879
He has to turn you
into a piece of charcoal.

470
00:37:39,732 --> 00:37:43,108
- You think Michael's gonna go for that?
- Who's more important to him now?

471
00:37:43,917 --> 00:37:44,917
You...

472
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:46,682
Or me?

473
00:37:47,425 --> 00:37:48,775
You listen to me.

474
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,811
You are nothing but a maggot
inside a worm's ass.

475
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,786
Do you know who I am...

476
00:37:54,911 --> 00:37:56,945
After I deliver you to Michael?

477
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,120
Expendable.

478
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:01,111
- Michael's not gonna kill me.
- Maybe not.

479
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:03,959
But I am.

480
00:38:27,322 --> 00:38:28,472
Can you walk?

481
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,398
Come on, move it!

482
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:41,827
Dean! Help!

483
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,580
Hold on! We'll get you out!

484
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,360


485
00:39:30,975 --> 00:39:32,575
You think Adam's okay?

486
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:35,164
Doubt it.

487
00:39:36,204 --> 00:39:38,254
Cass either. But we'll get 'em.

488
00:39:43,407 --> 00:39:44,407
So?

489
00:39:47,002 --> 00:39:48,002
So what?

490
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,145
I saw your eyes.

491
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:52,681
You were rockin' the yes back there.

492
00:39:54,835 --> 00:39:56,685
So, what changed your mind?

493
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:01,125
Honestly?

494
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:05,186
The damndest thing.

495
00:40:07,173 --> 00:40:08,952
I mean, the world's ending,

496
00:40:09,077 --> 00:40:11,177
the walls are coming down on us,

497
00:40:12,002 --> 00:40:15,152
and I look over to you
and all I can think about is,

498
00:40:15,686 --> 00:40:17,706
"this stupid son of a bitch
brought me here."

499
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,043
I just didn't want to let you down.

500
00:40:26,664 --> 00:40:27,714
You didn't.

501
00:40:28,062 --> 00:40:29,312
You almost did.

502
00:40:30,466 --> 00:40:31,716
But you didn't.

503
00:40:33,921 --> 00:40:36,391
- I owe you an apology.
- No, man. No, you don't.

504
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,420
Let me say this.

505
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:43,488
I don't know if it's being a big brother
or what,

506
00:40:44,801 --> 00:40:46,679
but to me you've always been this

507
00:40:47,565 --> 00:40:48,765
snot-nosed kid

508
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:51,114
I've had to keep
on the straight and narrow.

509
00:40:52,712 --> 00:40:55,012
We both know that's not you anymore.

510
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:03,077
I mean, hell, if you're grown-up enough
to find faith in me...

511
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:06,588
The least I can do
is return the favor.

512
00:41:13,376 --> 00:41:14,513
So, screw destiny

513
00:41:15,285 --> 00:41:16,545
right in the face.

514
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,683
I say we take the fight to them,
do it our way.

515
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,820
Sounds good.
