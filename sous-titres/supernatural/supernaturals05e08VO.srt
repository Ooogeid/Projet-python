1
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:04,095
Lilith was the final seal.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,480
I killed her,
and I set lucifer free.

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:10,050
You sons of bitches
jump-started judgment day!

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,845
- It's apocalypse now.
- Raphael, where is he?

5
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:15,679
- God?
- He's dead, Castiel.

6
00:00:16,628 --> 00:00:18,869
- You know who I am.
- Lucifer.

7
00:00:18,994 --> 00:00:21,103
- You're the one, Sam.
- You're my true vessel.

8
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:23,314
- That'll never happen.
- You're the michael sword.

9
00:00:23,483 --> 00:00:25,362
-  I'm the sword?
- You're michael's weapon.

10
00:00:25,487 --> 00:00:27,589
- I'm a vessel?
- You're The vessel.

11
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,446
You got a trickster on your hands.

12
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:33,074
- What is it, spirit, demon?
- More like demigod.

13
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:36,188
They're immortal, and they can
create things out of thin air,

14
00:00:36,313 --> 00:00:37,999
usually with a sense of humor...

15
00:00:38,124 --> 00:00:39,069
Deadly pranks.

16
00:00:39,194 --> 00:00:41,998
Another thing Bobby mentioned was that
these suckers have a real sweet tooth.

17
00:00:42,123 --> 00:00:44,891
So this is fun for you?
Killing Dean over and over again?

18
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:47,004
Sam, there's a lesson here.

19
00:00:47,388 --> 00:00:49,371
- What lesson?
- Dean's your weakness.

20
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:51,008
The bad guys know it, too.

21
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:52,801
He's gonna be the death of you, Sam.

22
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,952
"Supernatural" is filmed
before a live studio audience.

23
00:01:12,089 --> 00:01:13,876
I'm gonna need a bigger mouth.

24
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:22,120
Hey, there, Sam.
What's happening?

25
00:01:22,594 --> 00:01:23,600
Oh, nothing.

26
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:26,210
Just the end of the world.

27
00:01:30,851 --> 00:01:32,491
You're gonna need a bigger mouth.

28
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,922
Have you done your research yet?

29
00:01:43,053 --> 00:01:44,895
All kinds of research.
All night.

30
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,491
We have some more "research" to do.

31
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:06,386
Son of a bitch!

32
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,895
= 508 =

33
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,521
= Supernatural Team =

34
00:03:02,354 --> 00:03:06,181
Wellington, Ohio Two Days Earlier

35
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:34,171
- Doctor...
- What are you watching?

36
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:36,242
It's a hospital show.

37
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:37,758
"Dr. Sexy M.D."

38
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,821
I think it's based on a book.

39
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:42,215
When did you hit menopause?

40
00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:45,193
It's called channel-surfing.

41
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:47,536
You ready?

42
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:48,899
Are you?

43
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,314
One more time...

44
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:53,943
The F.B.I. Is here why, exactly?

45
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,052
It might have something to do

46
00:03:56,177 --> 00:03:58,197
with one of your locals
getting his head ripped off.

47
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:01,755
- Bill randolph died from a bear attack.
- How sure are you that it was a bear?

48
00:04:02,428 --> 00:04:03,702
What else would it be?

49
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:06,753
Whatever it was,
it chased Mr.Randolph through the woods,

50
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:09,587
smashed through his front door,
followed him up the stairs,

51
00:04:09,712 --> 00:04:11,729
and killed him in his bedroom.

52
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,253
Is that common...
A bear doing all that?

53
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:16,546
Depends how pissed off it is,
I guess.

54
00:04:17,426 --> 00:04:19,876
The Randolphs lived way up
in high country.

55
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:22,978
You got trout runs
that'll make a grown man weep...

56
00:04:23,103 --> 00:04:23,903
And bears.

57
00:04:24,028 --> 00:04:25,975
Right.
Now, what about Mrs. Randolph?

58
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,766
The file says she saw
the whole thing.

59
00:04:28,283 --> 00:04:31,326
Yes, she did.
My heart goes out to that poor woman.

60
00:04:31,611 --> 00:04:32,563
She said bear?

61
00:04:35,804 --> 00:04:38,433
Kathy randolph went through
a hell of a trauma.

62
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,112
She's confused.

63
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,408
What did she say?

64
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,716
No. It must have been a bear.

65
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:49,672
I mean,
what else could it have been?

66
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:52,784
Mrs. Randolph...

67
00:04:53,516 --> 00:04:55,007
What did you think it was?

68
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,868
No. I remember clearly now.

69
00:05:00,993 --> 00:05:02,551
It was definitely a bear.

70
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:04,414
We're sure it was.

71
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:07,514
But see,
it helps us to hear, every angle.

72
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,017
So, just tell us what you
thought you saw.

73
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:16,028
Well, it's impossible, but...

74
00:05:17,842 --> 00:05:20,444
I could have sworn I saw...

75
00:05:22,263 --> 00:05:23,659
The incredible Hulk.

76
00:05:30,428 --> 00:05:31,559
The incredible Hulk?

77
00:05:31,684 --> 00:05:33,355
I told you.
It's crazy.

78
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:40,403
Bana or Norton?

79
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,289
No, those movies were terrible.

80
00:05:43,414 --> 00:05:44,878
The TV-Hulk.

81
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,178
- Lou Ferrigno?
- Yes.

82
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,348
- Spiky-hair Lou Ferrigno?
- Yes!

83
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:54,186
You think I'm crazy.

84
00:05:54,624 --> 00:05:55,234
No.

85
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,556
No, it's just...

86
00:05:59,077 --> 00:05:59,966
Is...

87
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:01,363
Is there...

88
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:06,207
Would there be any reason
that Lou Ferrigno,

89
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,910
the incredible Hulk would have
a grudge against your husband?

90
00:06:12,866 --> 00:06:13,485
No.

91
00:06:15,156 --> 00:06:15,780
No.

92
00:06:21,794 --> 00:06:22,960
Find anything?

93
00:06:24,505 --> 00:06:25,592
I saw the house.

94
00:06:26,275 --> 00:06:26,926
And?

95
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:31,339
And there is a giant 8-foot-wide hole
where the front door used to be.

96
00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:33,808
- Almost like...
- A Hulk-sized hole.

97
00:06:35,143 --> 00:06:36,955
- Maybe.
- What do you got?

98
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,648
It turns out that Bill Randolph
had quite the temper.

99
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:45,331
He's got two counts
of spousal battery, bar brawls,

100
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:48,073
and court-ordered
anger-management sessions.

101
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:51,618
You might say you
wouldn't like him when he's angry.

102
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:56,694
So, a hothead getting killed
by tv's greatest hothead.

103
00:06:57,931 --> 00:07:00,005
Kind of sounds like just deserts,
doesn't it?

104
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,428
It's all starting to make sense.

105
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:05,297
How is it starting to make sense?

106
00:07:06,277 --> 00:07:08,107
I found something else
at the crime scene.

107
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:10,179
Candy wrappers.

108
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:13,154
Lots of 'em.

109
00:07:16,232 --> 00:07:18,270
Just deserts, sweet tooth,

110
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,916
screwing with people
before you kill them.

111
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,599
We're dealing
with the trickster, aren't we?

112
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:25,123
Sure looks like.

113
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,630
Good.

114
00:07:26,953 --> 00:07:29,553
Been wanting to gank
that mother since mystery spot.

115
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,168
You sure?

116
00:07:33,316 --> 00:07:34,418
Yeah, I'm sure.

117
00:07:34,798 --> 00:07:36,538
No, are you sure you
want to kill him?

118
00:07:37,561 --> 00:07:39,744
Son of a bitch didn't think twice
about icing me...

119
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:41,681
- A thousand times.
- No. I know.

120
00:07:41,987 --> 00:07:43,926
- I'm just saying.
- What are you saying?

121
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:46,014
If you don't want to kill him,
then what?

122
00:07:48,415 --> 00:07:50,279
- Talk to him.
- What?

123
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,391
Look, think about it, Dean.

124
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,288
He's one of the most powerful
creatures we've ever met.

125
00:07:55,723 --> 00:07:57,476
- Maybe we can use him.
- For what?

126
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:00,978
Okay, trickster's like
a hugh hefner type, right?

127
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,601
Wine, women, song.

128
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,680
Maybe he doesn't want
the party to end.

129
00:08:04,805 --> 00:08:07,390
Maybe he hates this "Angels and Demons"
stuff as much as we do.

130
00:08:07,515 --> 00:08:08,612
Maybe he'll help us.

131
00:08:09,671 --> 00:08:11,119
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

132
00:08:11,244 --> 00:08:12,687
Ally with the trickster?

133
00:08:13,381 --> 00:08:14,076
Yeah.

134
00:08:15,106 --> 00:08:18,007
A bloody, violent monster...

135
00:08:18,934 --> 00:08:20,958
And you want to be
facebook friends with him?

136
00:08:21,373 --> 00:08:22,512
Nice, Sammy.

137
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:24,127
The world is gonna end, Dean.

138
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:26,395
We don't have the luxury
of a moral stand.

139
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:28,791
I'm just saying, it's worth a shot.
That's all.

140
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,164
If it doesn't work...

141
00:08:31,163 --> 00:08:32,163
We'll kill him.

142
00:08:35,574 --> 00:08:37,090
How we gonna find the guy, anyway?

143
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:39,284
He never takes
just one victim, right?

144
00:08:40,023 --> 00:08:40,955
He'll show.

145
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:50,131
Dispatch?

146
00:08:50,256 --> 00:08:53,948
I got a possible 187 out here
at the old paper mill on route 6.

147
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,500
Roger that.
What are you looking at, son?

148
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:01,039
Honestly, I wouldn't even know how
to begin to describe what I'm seeing.

149
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,458
Just, send everybody.

150
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,879
All right, stay calm, stay back
in your car. Help's on the way.

151
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,082
- That sounds weird.
- Weird enough to be our guy?

152
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:20,377
There was a murder here...

153
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:22,811
And there's no police cars...
There's nobody.

154
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,882
How does that look to you?

155
00:09:26,276 --> 00:09:27,008
Crappy.

156
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:48,278
What the hell?

157
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:52,646
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

158
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,454
Doctor?

159
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,181
Doctor.

160
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:10,977
- Seriously?
- What?

161
00:10:11,102 --> 00:10:13,402
Seriously, you're brilliant,
you know that?

162
00:10:13,873 --> 00:10:16,577
And a coward.
You're a brilliant coward.

163
00:10:18,055 --> 00:10:19,605
What are you talking about?

164
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:21,557
As if you don't know.

165
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:26,719
I don't believe this.

166
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,582
- What?
- That was Dr. Piccolo.

167
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:30,712
Who?

168
00:10:31,822 --> 00:10:33,057
Dr. Ellen Piccolo.

169
00:10:34,064 --> 00:10:37,115
The sexy-yet-earnest doctor at...

170
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,445
Seattle Mercy Hospital.

171
00:10:46,962 --> 00:10:49,426
What the hell are you talking about?
The doctor getups.

172
00:10:49,551 --> 00:10:51,148
The sexy interns.

173
00:10:51,273 --> 00:10:52,680
The "seriouslys."

174
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,683
- It all makes sense.
- What makes sense?

175
00:10:54,808 --> 00:10:57,906
- What's going on?
- We're in "Dr. Sexy M. D"

176
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:09,666
Dude, what the hell?

177
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:11,676
- I don't know.
- No, seriously. What the hell?

178
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:12,713
I don't know.

179
00:11:12,849 --> 00:11:14,210
One theory.
Any theory.

180
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:17,533
The trickster trapped us in TV land.

181
00:11:17,658 --> 00:11:19,368
That's your theory?
That's stupid.

182
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:21,468
You're the one who said
we're on "Dr. Sexy M.D"

183
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:23,393
Yeah, but tv land isn't tv land.

184
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:25,621
There's actors and lights
and crew members.

185
00:11:25,746 --> 00:11:27,477
- This looks real.
- It can't be.

186
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,571
Dean, how can this possibly be real?

187
00:11:29,696 --> 00:11:31,557
I don't know.
All right?

188
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:38,293
But there goes Dr. Wang,
the sexy-but-arrogant heart surgeon.

189
00:11:39,704 --> 00:11:42,022
And there's Johnny Drake.

190
00:11:42,147 --> 00:11:44,923
He's not even alive.
He's a ghost in the mind of...

191
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:51,251
of her, the sexy-but-neurotic
doctor over there.

192
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:54,246
So, this show has ghosts?

193
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:55,767
Why?

194
00:11:57,089 --> 00:11:58,638
I don't know.
It is compelling.

195
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:01,208
I thought you said you aren't a fan.

196
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,735
I'm not.

197
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:07,125
Oh, boy.

198
00:12:07,891 --> 00:12:08,749
What?

199
00:12:09,882 --> 00:12:11,693
- It's him.
- Who?

200
00:12:15,123 --> 00:12:16,360
It's him.
It's Dr. Sexy.

201
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,207
Doctor.

202
00:12:21,925 --> 00:12:22,658
Doctor.

203
00:12:24,434 --> 00:12:25,346
Doctor.

204
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:29,352
Doctor.

205
00:12:30,177 --> 00:12:33,710
You want to give me one good reason
why you defied my direct order

206
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,089
to do the experimental face transplant
on Mrs. Beale?

207
00:12:40,717 --> 00:12:41,734
One reason?

208
00:12:43,754 --> 00:12:44,513
Sure.

209
00:12:52,765 --> 00:12:54,648
- You're not Dr. Sexy.
- You're crazy.

210
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,451
Really?

211
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:59,403
'cause I swore part of
what makes Dr. Sexy sexy

212
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,863
is the fact
that he wears cowboys boots...

213
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,638
Not tennis shoes.

214
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:05,397
Yeah, you're not a fan.

215
00:13:06,242 --> 00:13:07,497
It's a guilty pleasure.

216
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:09,039
Call security.

217
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:10,487
Yeah, go ahead, pal.

218
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:12,703
See, we know what you are.

219
00:13:20,915 --> 00:13:22,989
You guys are getting better.

220
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,803
Get us the hell out of here.

221
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:26,433
Or what?

222
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:30,481
Don't see your wooden stakes,
big guy.

223
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:34,027
That was you on the police scanner?
This is a trick.

224
00:13:36,776 --> 00:13:37,983
Trickster?

225
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,651
Come on!
I heard you two yahoos were in town.

226
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,904
- How could I resist?
- Where the hell are we?

227
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,125
You like it?

228
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,768
It's all homemade.

229
00:13:46,438 --> 00:13:49,367
My own sets, my own actors.

230
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:52,998
Call it my own little idiot box.

231
00:13:53,435 --> 00:13:54,669
How do we get out?

232
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:58,047
That, my friend,
is the $64 question.

233
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,283
Whatever. We just...
We need to talk to you.

234
00:14:00,408 --> 00:14:01,735
We need your help.

235
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:05,762
Let me guess.

236
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,474
You two muttonheads broke the world,
and you want me to sweep up your mess?

237
00:14:11,035 --> 00:14:11,943
Please.

238
00:14:12,512 --> 00:14:13,693
Just five minutes.

239
00:14:14,195 --> 00:14:15,686
- Hear us out.
- Sure.

240
00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:17,868
Tell you what.

241
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,859
Survive the 24 next hours,
we'll talk.

242
00:14:21,435 --> 00:14:23,997
- Survive what?
- The game.

243
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,489
What game?

244
00:14:26,486 --> 00:14:27,365
You're in it.

245
00:14:29,496 --> 00:14:30,471
How do we play?

246
00:14:31,418 --> 00:14:33,867
- You're playing it.
- What are the rules?

247
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:39,589
Son of a bitch.

248
00:14:42,477 --> 00:14:43,453
Dr. Sexy?

249
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,319
Dr. Sexy?

250
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:52,429
Paging Dr. Sexy.

251
00:14:52,884 --> 00:14:53,948
Report to the E.R.

252
00:14:54,438 --> 00:14:56,418
By the way, talking with monsters?

253
00:14:56,543 --> 00:14:57,542
Hell of a plan.

254
00:14:58,242 --> 00:14:59,465
What do we do now?

255
00:15:00,246 --> 00:15:02,108
You know what I'm doing?
Leaving.

256
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:04,492
Lady...

257
00:15:04,927 --> 00:15:05,848
What the hell?

258
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:08,072
You are a brilliant, brilliant...

259
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:10,670
Yeah, a coward.
You already said that.

260
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:12,059
But I got news for you.

261
00:15:12,855 --> 00:15:14,037
I am not a doctor.

262
00:15:16,968 --> 00:15:18,202
Don't say that.

263
00:15:19,016 --> 00:15:23,097
You are the finest cerebrovascular
neurosurgeon I have ever met...

264
00:15:23,585 --> 00:15:24,965
And I have met plenty.

265
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,175
So that girl died on your table.

266
00:15:27,584 --> 00:15:29,089
It wasn't your fault.

267
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,938
It wasn't anybody's fault.

268
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:32,973
Sometimes people just die.

269
00:15:35,362 --> 00:15:37,667
I have no idea what
you're saying to me.

270
00:15:38,436 --> 00:15:39,647
You're afraid.

271
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:44,859
You're afraid to operate again,
and you're afraid to love.

272
00:15:49,405 --> 00:15:50,924
Yeah, we're getting out of here.

273
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,781
Hey, doctor.

274
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,286
Yes?

275
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:56,475
My wife needs that face transplant.

276
00:15:58,313 --> 00:15:59,480
You know what, pal?

277
00:15:59,737 --> 00:16:01,191
None of this is real, okay?

278
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:03,210
And your wife doesn't
need jack squat.

279
00:16:15,345 --> 00:16:16,972
Real!
It's real!

280
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,474
We need a doctor!

281
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,078
B.P. Is 80 over 50 and dropping.

282
00:16:44,348 --> 00:16:45,284
Doctor?

283
00:16:48,104 --> 00:16:48,945
What?

284
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:56,505
Sam, do something.
Come on.

285
00:16:57,128 --> 00:16:59,339
I don't know how to use
any of this crap.

286
00:16:59,464 --> 00:17:00,545
Figure it out!

287
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:06,899
Sam!
Come on. I'm waiting.

288
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,304
I need a...

289
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:17,118
Penknife, some dental floss,
a sewing needle, and a fifth of whiskey.

290
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:23,743
Stat!

291
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,533
We okay?

292
00:17:34,658 --> 00:17:37,096
- How's it looking?
- Yep. You'll be fine.

293
00:18:09,957 --> 00:18:11,506
Let's play.

294
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:12,972
Nut-Cracker!

295
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,094
NUT-CRACKER

296
00:18:27,047 --> 00:18:28,806
Sam winchester...

297
00:18:29,854 --> 00:18:35,780
What was the name of the demon
you chose over your own brother?

298
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:37,831
Countdown.

299
00:18:38,104 --> 00:18:38,796
What?

300
00:18:40,596 --> 00:18:42,560
- What am I supposed to say?
- You think I know?

301
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:45,414
I don't understand japanese.

302
00:18:47,408 --> 00:18:51,129
What was the name of the demon
you chose over your own brother?

303
00:18:54,111 --> 00:18:57,949
Is he screwing with me?
I can't speak japanese...

304
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,474
The answer is...

305
00:19:04,328 --> 00:19:05,323
Ruby.

306
00:19:08,293 --> 00:19:10,148
I'm sorry, Sam winchester.

307
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:11,479
Sorry?

308
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:12,990
Sorry for what?

309
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,867
Nut-Cracker!

310
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:29,793
Nut-Cracker!

311
00:19:35,718 --> 00:19:37,047
Hello, chikato-san?

312
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,311
Hai?


313
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,762
Have we discussed these
nutritious Shrimp Chips?

314
00:19:43,887 --> 00:19:45,375
Lots of nutrition, tastes great...

315
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,975
and the more one eats,
the slimmer they get just like you.

316
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:49,612
You okay?

317
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,074
Now what?

318
00:20:02,778 --> 00:20:03,778
Cass?

319
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:07,839
- Is this another trick?
- It's me.

320
00:20:08,455 --> 00:20:10,583
- What are you doing here?
- Us? What about you?

321
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,752
Looking for you.
You've been missing for days.

322
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,254
Get us out of here.

323
00:20:15,305 --> 00:20:16,305
Let's go.

324
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:18,539
Cass.

325
00:20:18,664 --> 00:20:20,134
No, no, no, no.

326
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,681
Mr. Trickster does not like

327
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:26,307
pretty-boy angels.

328
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:37,844
Dean Winchester...

329
00:20:44,647 --> 00:20:46,647
I don't want to get hit in the nuts.

330
00:20:47,843 --> 00:20:49,363
- Countdown.
- What do I do?

331
00:20:49,488 --> 00:20:51,676
- I don't wanna get hit in the nuts.
- I don't know.

332
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,419
Just...

333
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:54,753
- Wait.
- What?

334
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,368
- I played a doctor.
- What?

335
00:20:56,493 --> 00:20:58,715
In Dr. Sexy.
I played a doctor, I operated.

336
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,279
- So?
- I did what the trickster wanted.

337
00:21:01,404 --> 00:21:03,428
- We have to go along with it.
- With what?

338
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,638
With the game.
We're on a game show, right?

339
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,467
- Answer the question.
- In Japanese?

340
00:21:07,592 --> 00:21:09,137
- I don't know Japanese!
- Try!

341
00:21:09,262 --> 00:21:10,262
Damn it!

342
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,003
Dean Winchester...

343
00:21:37,508 --> 00:21:39,589
Nuts-cracker champion!

344
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,634
How did you do that?

345
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,010
I have no idea.

346
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,401
So, that's it.

347
00:21:46,424 --> 00:21:48,139
We play our roles, we survive.

348
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:50,558
Play our roles for how long?

349
00:21:51,123 --> 00:21:52,323
Good question.

350
00:22:06,516 --> 00:22:08,158
I've got genital herpes.

351
00:22:09,274 --> 00:22:10,578
I've got genital herpes.

352
00:22:14,297 --> 00:22:15,297
Seriously?

353
00:22:16,624 --> 00:22:18,478
You're the one who said
play our roles.

354
00:22:22,965 --> 00:22:25,468
I've got genital herpes.

355
00:22:26,005 --> 00:22:27,387
I tried to be responsible.

356
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,700
Did I try.

357
00:22:31,471 --> 00:22:34,702
But now I take twice-daily herpexia

358
00:22:35,116 --> 00:22:37,605
to reduce my chances
of passing it on.

359
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,692
Ask your doctor
about using herpexia.

360
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,100
Patients should always consult
with a physician before using herpexia.

361
00:22:45,225 --> 00:22:46,948
Possible side effects
include headache,

362
00:22:47,116 --> 00:22:49,486
diarrhea,
permanent erectile dysfunction,

363
00:22:49,611 --> 00:22:51,711
thoughts of suicide, and nausea.

364
00:22:52,492 --> 00:22:53,990
I am doing all I can

365
00:22:54,115 --> 00:22:56,835
to slightly lessen the spread of...

366
00:22:57,842 --> 00:22:58,842
Of...

367
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,740
Genital herpes

368
00:23:02,316 --> 00:23:04,016
And that's a good thing.

369
00:23:10,945 --> 00:23:12,945
We now return to Supernatural.

370
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,730
Son of a bitch!

371
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,568
I am really, really very sorry,

372
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,360
but...

373
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:28,031
We've got some work to do.

374
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,750
But we did do work...

375
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:32,069
In depth.

376
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:43,504
How long
do we have to keep doing this?

377
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:47,175
I don't know.

378
00:23:49,757 --> 00:23:50,957
Maybe forever?

379
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,589
We might die in here.

380
00:23:56,178 --> 00:23:57,578
How is that funny?

381
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:58,970
Vultures.

382
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,674
- You okay?
- I don't have much time.

383
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:05,485
- What happened?
- I got out.

384
00:24:05,906 --> 00:24:07,728
- From where?
- Listen to me.

385
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:10,406
This thing
is more powerful than it should be.

386
00:24:10,776 --> 00:24:12,784
- What, the trickster?
- If it is a trickster.

387
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:13,953
What?

388
00:24:16,503 --> 00:24:17,503
Hello!

389
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:19,427
Thank you.

390
00:24:21,808 --> 00:24:23,711
Thank you!
Ladies... Stop!

391
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,321
Hi, Castiel.

392
00:24:30,686 --> 00:24:32,470
- You know him?
- Where did you just him?

393
00:24:33,253 --> 00:24:34,653
Relax. He'll live.

394
00:24:35,438 --> 00:24:36,723
Maybe.

395
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,887
You know what...
I'm done with the monkey dance.

396
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,021
Okay? We get it.

397
00:24:43,684 --> 00:24:44,815
Get what, hotshot?

398
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:47,692
Playing our roles, right?
That's your game?

399
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:50,103
- That's half the game.
- What's the other half?

400
00:24:50,228 --> 00:24:51,781
Play your roles out there.

401
00:24:52,345 --> 00:24:54,753
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know...

402
00:24:54,878 --> 00:24:56,410
Sam, starring as Lucifer.

403
00:24:56,714 --> 00:24:58,814
Dean, starring as Michael.

404
00:24:59,444 --> 00:25:01,244
Your celebrity deathmatch.

405
00:25:01,604 --> 00:25:03,084
Play your roles.

406
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,503
You want us to say yes
to those sons of bitches?

407
00:25:05,801 --> 00:25:08,256
Hells, yeah.
Let's light this candle!

408
00:25:08,739 --> 00:25:10,424
We do that, the world will end.

409
00:25:12,252 --> 00:25:14,669
And whose fault is that?

410
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:18,009
Who popped Lucifer out of the box?

411
00:25:19,965 --> 00:25:21,560
Look, it's started.

412
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:23,299
You started it.

413
00:25:23,547 --> 00:25:26,440
It can't be stopped.
So, let's get it over with.

414
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:32,033
Heaven or hell...
Which side you on?

415
00:25:32,158 --> 00:25:33,808
I'm not on either side.

416
00:25:34,392 --> 00:25:35,404
Yeah, right.

417
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:37,869
You're grabbing ankle
for Michael or Lucifer. Which one?

418
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:42,632
You listen to me, you arrogant dick.

419
00:25:43,328 --> 00:25:46,419
I don't work for either
of those S.O.B.S believe me.

420
00:25:47,883 --> 00:25:49,380
You're somebody's bitch.

421
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:56,762
Don't you ever,
ever presume to know what I am.

422
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,240
Now, listen very closely.

423
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:07,977
Here's what's gonna happen.

424
00:26:08,102 --> 00:26:11,194
You're gonna suck it up,
accept your responsibilities,

425
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:14,614
and play the roles that destiny
has chosen for you.

426
00:26:15,035 --> 00:26:16,115
And if we don't?

427
00:26:20,824 --> 00:26:22,974
Then you'll stay here in TV land.

428
00:26:23,443 --> 00:26:24,443
Forever.

429
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,586
300 channels and, nothing's on.

430
00:26:51,968 --> 00:26:52,968
Come on.

431
00:26:53,781 --> 00:26:56,281
- What do you think?
- What do I think?

432
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,650
Go screw yourself,
that's what I think.

433
00:26:58,775 --> 00:27:00,516
Can you give us a sec, please?

434
00:27:00,641 --> 00:27:01,641
Thanks.

435
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:04,195
- You got to calm down.
- Calm down?

436
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,260
I am wearing sunglasses at night.

437
00:27:06,385 --> 00:27:08,754
You know who does that?
No-talent douche bags.

438
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:10,229
I hate this game.

439
00:27:10,354 --> 00:27:12,345
I hate that we're in a procedural
cop show.

440
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:15,712
And you want to know why?
Because I hate procedural cop shows!

441
00:27:15,837 --> 00:27:18,317
There's like 300 of them on television.
They're all the same.

442
00:27:18,442 --> 00:27:21,087
It's, "Ooh, a plane crashed here".
Shut up!

443
00:27:22,072 --> 00:27:23,072
What?

444
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,000
Check out sweet tooth over there.

445
00:27:29,003 --> 00:27:30,353
Think that's him?

446
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,582
Just, follow my lead.

447
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,254
You okay?

448
00:27:55,993 --> 00:27:57,243
What do we got?

449
00:27:58,474 --> 00:27:59,474
Well...

450
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:01,981
Aside from the ligature marks
around his neck,

451
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,949
he has what appears to be a roll
of quarters jammed down his throat.

452
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:10,888
Well, I say...

453
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
Jackpot.

454
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:16,821
Also...

455
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:19,279
There was a stab wound
to the lower abdomen there.

456
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:30,539
Well, I say...

457
00:28:33,493 --> 00:28:34,879
No guts, no glory.

458
00:28:36,551 --> 00:28:37,901
Get that guy a...

459
00:28:40,526 --> 00:28:41,526
Tums.

460
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,723
Gutter ball.

461
00:28:48,783 --> 00:28:50,483
That's a good one, guys.

462
00:29:19,298 --> 00:29:21,425
- You got the wrong guy, idiot.
- Did we?

463
00:29:52,928 --> 00:29:54,364
I'm worried, man...

464
00:29:54,489 --> 00:29:56,439
What that S.O.B. did to Cass.

465
00:29:56,844 --> 00:29:58,444
You know, where is he?

466
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:01,916
Sam?

467
00:30:05,122 --> 00:30:06,322
Where are you?

468
00:30:09,637 --> 00:30:11,637
It's Sam.
Leave me a message.

469
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:14,059
Sam, it's me.

470
00:30:15,657 --> 00:30:17,157
The hell did you go?

471
00:30:24,877 --> 00:30:26,077
Where are you?

472
00:30:26,514 --> 00:30:27,664
I don't know.

473
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,368
Crap.

474
00:30:30,948 --> 00:30:32,978
I don't think
we killed the trickster.

475
00:30:53,993 --> 00:30:56,645
Okay, stake didn't work.
So, what? This another trick?

476
00:30:57,075 --> 00:30:58,225
I don't know.

477
00:30:58,588 --> 00:31:01,115
Maybe the stake didn't work
because it's not a trickster.

478
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,252
- What do you mean?
- You heard Cass.

479
00:31:03,377 --> 00:31:05,825
He said this thing was too powerful
to be a trickster.

480
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,718
D'you notice how he looked at Cass?

481
00:31:07,843 --> 00:31:08,948
Like he knew him.

482
00:31:09,073 --> 00:31:11,604
And how pissed he got
when you brought up Michael and Lucifer.

483
00:31:13,054 --> 00:31:14,663
- Son of a bitch.
- What?

484
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:17,124
I know what we're dealing with.

485
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:30,972
What?

486
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:33,939
That feels really uncomfortable.

487
00:31:38,075 --> 00:31:41,148
- You sure this is gonna work?
- No, but I have no other ideas.

488
00:31:47,017 --> 00:31:49,017
All right, you son of a bitch!

489
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:51,579
Uncle!

490
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:55,245
We'll do it!

491
00:31:57,189 --> 00:31:58,389
Should I honk?

492
00:32:01,928 --> 00:32:03,921
Sam, get a load of the rims on you.

493
00:32:04,282 --> 00:32:05,282
Eat me.

494
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:08,293
Okay, boys...

495
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:10,928
Ready to go quietly?

496
00:32:11,524 --> 00:32:12,624
Not so fast.

497
00:32:13,812 --> 00:32:16,477
Nobody's going anywhere
until Sam has opposable thumbs.

498
00:32:16,897 --> 00:32:18,169
What's the difference?

499
00:32:18,294 --> 00:32:20,669
Satan's gonna ride his ass
one way or another.

500
00:32:32,986 --> 00:32:33,986
Happy?

501
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:38,622
Tell me one thing.
Why didn't the stake kill you?

502
00:32:40,838 --> 00:32:43,335
- I am the trickster.
- But maybe you're not.

503
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,253
Maybe you've always been an angel.

504
00:32:54,949 --> 00:32:55,949
A what?

505
00:32:57,229 --> 00:32:59,439
Somebody slip a mickey
in your power shake, kid?

506
00:32:59,564 --> 00:33:01,014
I'll tell you what.

507
00:33:01,139 --> 00:33:03,230
You just jump out of the holy fire,

508
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,566
and we'll call it our mistake.

509
00:33:18,412 --> 00:33:19,812
Well played, boys.

510
00:33:20,596 --> 00:33:21,696
Well played.

511
00:33:23,747 --> 00:33:25,419
Where'd you get the holy oil?

512
00:33:26,323 --> 00:33:28,464
You might say
we pulled it out of Sam's ass.

513
00:33:31,197 --> 00:33:33,468
- Where'd I screw up?
- You didn't.

514
00:33:34,077 --> 00:33:36,142
But nobody gets the jump on Cass
like you did.

515
00:33:36,267 --> 00:33:38,015
It was how you talked about
Armageddon.

516
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:42,479
- Meaning?
- Well, call it personal experience.

517
00:33:43,585 --> 00:33:44,802
Nobody gets that angry

518
00:33:44,927 --> 00:33:47,189
unless they're talking about
their own family.

519
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:52,446
So, which one are you?
Grumpy, Sneezy, or Douchey?

520
00:33:56,471 --> 00:33:57,671
Gabriel, okay?

521
00:34:00,034 --> 00:34:01,497
They call me Gabriel.

522
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,220
Gabriel?

523
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,284
The archangel?

524
00:34:05,829 --> 00:34:06,829
Guilty.

525
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:09,046
Okay, Gabriel.

526
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,173
How does an archangel
become a trickster?

527
00:34:12,265 --> 00:34:14,259
My own private witness protection.

528
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:17,293
I skipped out of Heaven,

529
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:18,683
had a face transplant,

530
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:21,158
carved out
my own little corner of the world

531
00:34:21,283 --> 00:34:23,333
till you two screwed it all up.

532
00:34:23,746 --> 00:34:26,504
And what did daddy say
when you ran off and joined the pagans?

533
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:29,191
Daddy doesn't say anything
about anything.

534
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,559
What happened?

535
00:34:30,684 --> 00:34:32,403
- Why'd you ditch?
- You blame him?

536
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:36,353
His brothers
are heavyweight douche-nozzles.

537
00:34:36,478 --> 00:34:37,978
Shut your cake hole.

538
00:34:38,845 --> 00:34:40,729
You don't know anything
about my family.

539
00:34:40,854 --> 00:34:42,254
I loved my father.

540
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,841
My brothers... loved them.

541
00:34:46,024 --> 00:34:49,253
But watching them turn on each other?
Tear at each other's throats?

542
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:52,255
I couldn't bear it, okay?

543
00:34:53,136 --> 00:34:54,136
So I left.

544
00:34:55,111 --> 00:34:58,011
And now,
it's happening all over again.

545
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,980
Help us stop it.

546
00:35:00,687 --> 00:35:01,890
It can't be stopped.

547
00:35:02,283 --> 00:35:05,602
- You want to see the end of the world?
- I want it to be over!

548
00:35:06,668 --> 00:35:07,786
I have to sit back

549
00:35:07,911 --> 00:35:10,399
and watch my brothers
kill each other, thanks to you two!

550
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,736
Heaven, hell...
I don't care who wins!

551
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:15,612
I just want it to be over!

552
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,614
It doesn't have to be like that.

553
00:35:18,087 --> 00:35:20,366
There has to be some way
to pull the plug.

554
00:35:22,368 --> 00:35:24,168
You do not know my family.

555
00:35:25,012 --> 00:35:28,961
What you guys call the apocalypse
I used to call Sunday dinner.

556
00:35:30,016 --> 00:35:33,787
That's why there's no stopping this...
Because this isn't about a war.

557
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,867
It's about two brothers
that loved each other

558
00:35:36,992 --> 00:35:38,692
and betrayed each other.

559
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,887
You think you'd be able to relate.

560
00:35:42,536 --> 00:35:43,972
What are you talking about?

561
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:52,282
You sorry sons of bitches.

562
00:35:53,045 --> 00:35:56,111
Why do you think
you two are the vessels?

563
00:35:57,034 --> 00:35:58,284
Think about it.

564
00:35:58,409 --> 00:35:59,409
Michael...

565
00:35:59,695 --> 00:36:02,618
The big brother,
loyal to an absent father.

566
00:36:03,947 --> 00:36:05,147
And Lucifer...

567
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:09,129
The little brother,
rebellious of daddy's plan.

568
00:36:11,861 --> 00:36:13,753
You were born to this, boys.

569
00:36:14,326 --> 00:36:15,464
It's your destiny!

570
00:36:16,066 --> 00:36:17,257
It was always you!

571
00:36:19,071 --> 00:36:20,621
As it is in heaven...

572
00:36:21,526 --> 00:36:23,708
So it must be on earth.

573
00:36:25,013 --> 00:36:27,213
One brother has to kill the other.

574
00:36:27,862 --> 00:36:29,450
What the hell are you saying?

575
00:36:29,575 --> 00:36:32,695
Why do you think I've always taken
such an interest in you?

576
00:36:34,182 --> 00:36:37,832
Because from the moment
dad flipped on the lights around here,

577
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:41,368
we knew it was all gonna end
with you.

578
00:36:43,184 --> 00:36:44,184
Always.

579
00:36:55,939 --> 00:36:57,639
That's not gonna happen.

580
00:36:58,554 --> 00:36:59,654
I'm sorry...

581
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:01,802
But it is.

582
00:37:10,716 --> 00:37:13,905
Guys, I wish this were a TV show.

583
00:37:14,677 --> 00:37:15,827
Easy answers,

584
00:37:16,721 --> 00:37:18,621
endings wrapped up in a bow.

585
00:37:21,646 --> 00:37:22,996
But this is real.

586
00:37:24,999 --> 00:37:27,369
And it's gonna end bloody
for all of us.

587
00:37:29,575 --> 00:37:31,625
That's just how it's got to be.

588
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:45,665
So, boys...

589
00:37:46,521 --> 00:37:47,521
Now what?

590
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,494
Stare at each other
for the rest of eternity?

591
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,877
First, you're gonna bring Cass back
from wherever you stashed him.

592
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:57,316
Am I?

593
00:37:58,716 --> 00:38:00,611
Or we're going to dunk you
in some holy oil

594
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,988
and deep-fry ourselves an archangel.

595
00:38:15,122 --> 00:38:16,372
Cass, you okay?

596
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,461
I'm fine.

597
00:38:22,273 --> 00:38:23,523
Hello, Gabriel.

598
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:25,416
Hey, bro.

599
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:28,264
How's the search for daddy going?

600
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,453
Let me guess.

601
00:38:29,578 --> 00:38:30,578
Awful.

602
00:38:38,124 --> 00:38:39,824
Okay, we're out of here.

603
00:38:41,308 --> 00:38:42,458
Come on, Sam.

604
00:38:47,939 --> 00:38:48,939
Guys?

605
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:50,872
So, what?

606
00:38:52,628 --> 00:38:55,165
You're just gonna...
You're gonna leave me here forever?

607
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:03,227
We're not. We don't screw with people
the way you do.

608
00:39:05,207 --> 00:39:06,757
And for the record...

609
00:39:07,487 --> 00:39:09,587
This isn't about some prizefight

610
00:39:09,712 --> 00:39:13,392
between your brothers
or some destiny that can't be stopped!

611
00:39:13,817 --> 00:39:17,354
This is about you being too afraid
to stand up to your family!

612
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,894
Don't say
I never did anything for you.

613
00:40:02,851 --> 00:40:05,853
That stuff he was spouting in there...
You think he was telling the truth?

614
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:08,639
I think he believes it.

615
00:40:10,597 --> 00:40:11,997
So, what do we do?

616
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:15,604
I don't know.

617
00:40:17,218 --> 00:40:20,131
I'll tell you one thing. Right now,
I wish I was on a TV show.

618
00:40:22,256 --> 00:40:23,406
Yeah, me too.
