1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,533
- Who are you?
- Castiel.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,980
I'm an angel of the lord.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,740
I'm the one who gripped you tight
and raised you from perdition.

4
00:00:10,775 --> 00:00:12,827
Hi, Dean, this is me, Lily.

5
00:00:12,862 --> 00:00:15,008
- You are not real!
- What's the matter, Dean?

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,407
Don't you remember all the fun
you had down there?

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,494
Somebody help me!

8
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:20,919
Hello again, Dean.

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,567
Don't you recognize me?

10
00:00:23,906 --> 00:00:26,330
But we were so close...
in hell.

11
00:00:26,372 --> 00:00:27,515
Alastair.

12
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:29,727
They sliced...

13
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:31,443
Carved...

14
00:00:32,109 --> 00:00:34,451
And tore at me
in ways that you...

15
00:00:35,608 --> 00:00:37,963
And Alastair
would make me an offer

16
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:41,580
To take me off the rack
if I started the torturing.

17
00:00:41,617 --> 00:00:44,843
And every day, I told him
to stick it where the sun shines.

18
00:00:44,888 --> 00:00:46,601
For 30 years, I told him.

19
00:00:46,645 --> 00:00:48,922
Then I couldn't do it anymore,
Sammy.

20
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,720
And I got off the rack.

21
00:00:50,805 --> 00:00:52,771
And I started
ripping them apart.

22
00:00:56,505 --> 00:00:58,710
I lost count
of how many souls.

23
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,501
Aw, come on.

24
00:01:28,507 --> 00:01:29,682
Crap.

25
00:01:37,106 --> 00:01:38,502
What the hell?!

26
00:01:57,506 --> 00:01:58,621
You?

27
00:01:59,105 --> 00:02:01,493
I-It's impossible.

28
00:02:02,808 --> 00:02:04,623
You stay away from me!

29
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:08,273
You stay away from me!

30
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:19,302
Supernatural
s04 ep11

31
00:02:38,706 --> 00:02:40,082
What are you doing?

32
00:02:40,808 --> 00:02:42,250
What does it look like
I'm doing?

33
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:43,803
Like you're looking for a job.

34
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:45,040
Yahtzee.

35
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:53,850
We just finished a job
like two hours ago.

36
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:55,522
Adrenaline's still pumping,
I guess.

37
00:02:56,007 --> 00:02:57,163
So, what do you think...

38
00:02:57,405 --> 00:03:00,292
Cedar rapids,
Tulsa, or chi-Town?

39
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:03,071
I am all for working.
I really am.

40
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:06,860
But you got us chasing cases nonstop
for like a month now.

41
00:03:07,206 --> 00:03:09,583
- We need sleep.
- We can sleep when we're dead.

42
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,283
- You're exhausted, Dean.
- I'm good.

43
00:03:11,315 --> 00:03:13,160
No, you're not.
You're running on fumes,

44
00:03:13,198 --> 00:03:14,932
and you can't run forever.

45
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,680
And what am I running from?

46
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:21,013
From what you told me.

47
00:03:22,706 --> 00:03:24,770
Or are we pretending
that never happened?

48
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,680
Stratton, Nebraska. Farm town.
A man gets hacked to death

49
00:03:32,725 --> 00:03:34,913
in a locked room
inside a locked house.

50
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:36,591
No signs of forced entry.

51
00:03:37,706 --> 00:03:40,083
- Sounds like a ghost.
- Yes, it does.

52
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:09,561
Boy, three bedrooms,
two baths, and one homicide.

53
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:12,271
This place is gonna sell
like hotcakes.

54
00:05:33,405 --> 00:05:34,603
Hey, check this out.

55
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,610
It's probably a dumbwaiter.

56
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,473
All these old houses had them.

57
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:44,372
Know-It-All.

58
00:05:45,607 --> 00:05:46,933
- What?
- What?

59
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:48,403
You said...

60
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:49,861
What?

61
00:05:50,305 --> 00:05:51,531
Never mind.

62
00:05:57,705 --> 00:06:00,120
Well, no bloodstains,
fresh coat of paint,

63
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:01,703
This is a bunch of bubkes.

64
00:06:01,807 --> 00:06:03,512
Needle's all over the place.

65
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,850
Yeah. Power lines.

66
00:06:06,807 --> 00:06:07,690
Great.

67
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:09,000
So, uh...

68
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,833
Well, that's super-disturbing.

69
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,281
Think it got left behind?

70
00:06:20,308 --> 00:06:21,572
By who?

71
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,451
Unless Bill Gibson likes to play
with doll heads.

72
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:33,153
I thought you said
this place was still for sale.

73
00:06:33,205 --> 00:06:34,313
Apparently, it's not.

74
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:43,410
Come on, Buster!

75
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,503
What do you think?
It's nice, right?

76
00:06:52,807 --> 00:06:55,512
{\a6}Did anyone bother to check
if we get a signal out here?

77
00:06:56,206 --> 00:06:57,953
{\a6}Actually, I did, Kate.

78
00:06:58,207 --> 00:07:01,432
{\a6}But we decided to move anyway,
just to ruin your life.

79
00:07:02,407 --> 00:07:04,240
{\a6}Come on. Let's unpack.

80
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:06,531
{\a6}Uncle Ted,
please back me up here.

81
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:08,852
Kid's right, Bri.
You're ruining her life.

82
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:10,050
See?

83
00:07:10,507 --> 00:07:12,331
Thanks for the help,
uncle Ted.

84
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:13,873
I call it like I see it, buddy.

85
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:16,373
- What?
- Be nice.

86
00:07:16,407 --> 00:07:17,631
I am nice.

87
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:22,762
What do you think?
We do okay?

88
00:07:24,205 --> 00:07:25,403
I don't know.

89
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:36,112
Who are they?

90
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:41,392
Can I help you?

91
00:07:41,405 --> 00:07:42,770
Hi. Are you the new owner?

92
00:07:42,808 --> 00:07:44,562
Yeah. You guys are...?

93
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:46,881
This is Mr. Stanwyk.
I'm Mr. Babar.

94
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:50,292
County code enforcement.

95
00:07:50,305 --> 00:07:53,432
We had the building inspected
last week.

96
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,060
Is there a problem?

97
00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:57,301
Asbestos in the walls,
a gas leak...

98
00:07:57,335 --> 00:07:59,051
Yeah, I'd say we got a problem.

99
00:07:59,107 --> 00:08:00,803
Asbestos? Meaning what?

100
00:08:00,838 --> 00:08:03,841
Meaning until this house is
up to code, it's uninhabitable.

101
00:08:05,205 --> 00:08:06,903
You're saying
we can't stay here?

102
00:08:06,938 --> 00:08:08,800
It's a health hazard.
You don't want to.

103
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,193
Hold up.
We just drove 400 miles.

104
00:08:12,265 --> 00:08:14,043
There's a motel
just down the road.

105
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:16,310
Till this gets cleaned up,
I suggest you stay there.

106
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:19,221
All right,
and what if we don't?

107
00:08:19,256 --> 00:08:20,911
Well, you get a fine,
you go to jail.

108
00:08:21,005 --> 00:08:22,262
Pick your poison.

109
00:08:30,908 --> 00:08:32,071
One night.

110
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:35,250
One night, and I'll take care
of everything,

111
00:08:35,298 --> 00:08:37,921
- A.S.A.P. I promise.
- Yeah, you do that.

112
00:08:38,606 --> 00:08:40,980
Another motel? Awesome, dad.

113
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:43,191
I hope this one has hooker sheets,
like the last one.

114
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:46,420
Come on, Danny!

115
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:51,832
What did the room look like
when you found it, Mrs. Curry?

116
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:54,772
I already told t local boys.
There was blood...

117
00:08:54,775 --> 00:08:56,262
everywhere.

118
00:08:56,305 --> 00:08:57,941
And Mr. Gibson, where was he?

119
00:08:59,107 --> 00:09:00,360
Everywhere.

120
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:04,920
How long have you been cleaning
Mr. Gibson's house?

121
00:09:05,006 --> 00:09:06,371
About five years.

122
00:09:06,405 --> 00:09:09,000
- So you knew him pretty well.
- Not really well.

123
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:12,011
He was real private.
Not the easiest man.

124
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:14,113
- Not that I blame him.
- What do you mean?

125
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,052
His wife dies in childbirth.

126
00:09:16,107 --> 00:09:18,151
Daughter hangs herself
in the attic 20 years later.

127
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,490
I'd be bitter, too.

128
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:22,290
I think I got some pictures.

129
00:09:29,205 --> 00:09:30,213
Here.

130
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:32,563
Thanks.

131
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:37,680
- Can we keep these?
- Suit yourself.

132
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,533
Now, why'd the daughter
kill herself?

133
00:09:39,605 --> 00:09:42,093
I don't know.
That was before my time.

134
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:44,690
Did you ever notice anything odd
in the house when you were cleaning it?

135
00:09:45,008 --> 00:09:46,610
- Like what?
- Like, you know,

136
00:09:46,647 --> 00:09:48,041
like lights going on and off,

137
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:50,282
things not being
where you left them.

138
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:55,302
Well, maybe
there was one thing.

139
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:56,412
What's that?

140
00:09:56,455 --> 00:09:58,553
Well, sometimes,
I thought I heard like a...

141
00:09:59,406 --> 00:10:01,223
rustling in the walls.

142
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,192
- Like a rat?
- Yeah.

143
00:10:03,805 --> 00:10:06,050
Must have been some
big sons of guns out there, huh?

144
00:10:06,602 --> 00:10:08,765
Wouldn't know. Never saw any.

145
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,647
Do you happen to know where
Mrs. Gibson and her ughter were buried?

146
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:14,483
They were both cremated.

147
00:10:15,609 --> 00:10:16,780
All right.

148
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:18,901
So it probably wasn't
the mom or the daughter.

149
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:22,512
- Whose ghost was it?
- I don't know.

150
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,573
But I say we give that place
a real once-over and see.

151
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:34,633
Code enforcement, my ass.
There's no asbestos.

152
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:35,681
- You sure?
- Hell yes.

153
00:10:35,728 --> 00:10:37,422
I've built enough homes
to know that.

154
00:10:37,507 --> 00:10:39,043
No gas leak, either.

155
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:40,992
- Who were those guys?
- Not from the county.

156
00:10:41,026 --> 00:10:42,262
I can tell you that.

157
00:10:56,607 --> 00:10:57,921
You okay?

158
00:11:02,506 --> 00:11:04,531
I just thought I saw something,
that's all.

159
00:11:08,006 --> 00:11:11,191
It... It's gonna be
great here, Kate.

160
00:11:11,206 --> 00:11:12,832
It really is.

161
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,401
Yeah, mom.

162
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:17,163
I'm sure.

163
00:11:17,405 --> 00:11:19,013
Everything's gonna change.

164
00:11:26,705 --> 00:11:29,440
Danny!
Are you unpacking?

165
00:11:30,605 --> 00:11:33,122
Yeah.
I'm almost finished.

166
00:12:03,605 --> 00:12:04,810
Hello?

167
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:08,950
It's okay.

168
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:16,161
I'm Danny.

169
00:12:26,906 --> 00:12:27,970
Hi!

170
00:12:29,808 --> 00:12:31,233
"Zucchini will grow,"

171
00:12:31,265 --> 00:12:34,293
"but the soil is too acidic
for beets".

172
00:12:35,108 --> 00:12:36,720
Do you understand
any of this?

173
00:12:36,785 --> 00:12:37,971
Can you smell that?

174
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:42,583
That.

175
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,101
It smells like a raccoon
died up there or something.

176
00:12:45,178 --> 00:12:46,682
That's pleasant.
Thank you.

177
00:12:46,727 --> 00:12:49,331
Can I continue having
a conversation with myself?

178
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:52,883
Well, I'm listening.
A... vegetable garden.

179
00:12:59,707 --> 00:13:01,433
What are we doing, Bri?

180
00:13:02,505 --> 00:13:06,292
- What do you mean?
- Us... on a farm...

181
00:13:06,305 --> 00:13:08,171
Talking about Zucchini.

182
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:14,312
It's gonna be different.

183
00:13:15,808 --> 00:13:17,383
I promise you.

184
00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:21,071
We're gonna be happy.

185
00:13:22,607 --> 00:13:24,080
And if we're not?

186
00:13:24,175 --> 00:13:25,470
We will be.

187
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,463
We have to be.

188
00:13:27,477 --> 00:13:30,582
I can't put the kids through
another year like the last.

189
00:13:40,006 --> 00:13:41,030
Crap.

190
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:43,260
So, what now?

191
00:13:44,507 --> 00:13:46,132
We could tell them the truth.

192
00:13:46,206 --> 00:13:48,370
- Really?
- No, not really.

193
00:13:58,008 --> 00:14:00,620
Hey, guys! You're gonna want
to come see this!

194
00:14:05,508 --> 00:14:06,560
What the...

195
00:14:13,007 --> 00:14:13,873
Crayon.

196
00:14:15,108 --> 00:14:16,320
Danny!

197
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:20,010
- Get your butt down here!
- Tell you what...

198
00:14:20,056 --> 00:14:22,313
- If my kid did this...
- He's not your kid, Ted.

199
00:14:22,347 --> 00:14:23,740
Just butt out.

200
00:14:26,707 --> 00:14:28,720
Hey. Go easy on him.

201
00:14:28,757 --> 00:14:30,691
The teacher said
he might act out.

202
00:14:32,907 --> 00:14:34,010
Hey, buddy.

203
00:14:35,905 --> 00:14:37,803
Something you want to tell
me and your mom?

204
00:14:37,907 --> 00:14:39,363
I didn't do that.

205
00:14:43,505 --> 00:14:45,321
Look,
just tell me the truth,

206
00:14:45,365 --> 00:14:47,500
And all you got to do
is clean it up, okay?

207
00:14:47,546 --> 00:14:49,542
- No punishment.
- But I didn't.

208
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:53,143
- The girl in the walls did it.
- The girl in the walls?

209
00:14:53,206 --> 00:14:55,153
She wants you to go
and me to stay.

210
00:14:55,225 --> 00:14:58,580
All right, one last time.
The truth, buddy.

211
00:14:58,626 --> 00:15:00,121
That is the truth.

212
00:15:00,168 --> 00:15:01,682
I can stay, but
she hates growing up

213
00:15:01,736 --> 00:15:04,650
and if you don't leave, she's
gonna get really, really mad!

214
00:15:04,688 --> 00:15:06,033
All right,
go to your room.

215
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:07,570
Mom!

216
00:15:13,107 --> 00:15:14,991
If andy were here,
he'd believe me!

217
00:15:15,028 --> 00:15:17,130
Upstairs! Now!

218
00:15:30,507 --> 00:15:33,911
It's okay, Buster.
It's okay.

219
00:15:34,008 --> 00:15:35,751
I hate it here, too.

220
00:15:39,507 --> 00:15:43,670
Buster! Gross!
What's the matter with you?

221
00:15:53,008 --> 00:15:56,172
Oh, my god.
Oh, god.

222
00:16:03,407 --> 00:16:05,063
- Ew! Ew!
- It's okay.

223
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:06,520
Katie, baby, baby.
Calm down

224
00:16:06,525 --> 00:16:08,073
- and tell us what happened.
- What's going on?

225
00:16:08,108 --> 00:16:09,930
{\a6}I just got molested
by Casper the pervy ghost!

226
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:11,531
{\a6}- That's what happened!
- Ghost?

227
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:14,492
{\a6}- Yes, dad. A ghost!
- It's the girl in the walls!

228
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:15,823
{\a6}Who?!

229
00:16:15,857 --> 00:16:17,931
{\a6}Both of you, knock it off.

230
00:16:20,505 --> 00:16:22,220
{\a6}We heard screams.
What's going on?

231
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,453
Oh, you two!
Did you touch my daughter?!

232
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:27,042
What? No.

233
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,963
- Who are you guys?
- Relax, please.

234
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,342
You have a ghost.

235
00:16:31,406 --> 00:16:33,522
- A ghost.
- I told you! It's the girl!

236
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:35,352
Both of you, relax.

237
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:38,242
- What are you guys playing?
- Your family's in danger.

238
00:16:38,308 --> 00:16:39,840
You need to get out
of the house now.

239
00:16:41,905 --> 00:16:43,513
- What the hell?
- Nobody move!

240
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,250
Buster!

241
00:17:04,506 --> 00:17:06,250
What the hell?

242
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:24,470
Go back inside.

243
00:17:24,507 --> 00:17:25,482
Go!

244
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,540
We are not the bad guys,

245
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:31,650
- but you're in danger.
- First thing's first.

246
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,140
You got to get your family
out of here.

247
00:17:37,705 --> 00:17:39,603
Head to the motel
I was talking about.

248
00:17:39,648 --> 00:17:41,722
- You'll be safe there.
- What are you two gonna do?

249
00:17:44,206 --> 00:17:45,762
Oh, come on!

250
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:54,020
Oh, come on!

251
00:17:58,707 --> 00:18:01,273
Dude, the guns are gone.
So is the...

252
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:06,062
Basically,
everything is gone.

253
00:18:06,107 --> 00:18:07,583
Truck's no good.

254
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:09,340
Both tires slashed.

255
00:18:09,377 --> 00:18:11,323
What kind of ghost messes
with a man's wheels?!

256
00:18:11,345 --> 00:18:14,171
What's going on?
What's going on?

257
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:18,120
She's there! She's there!

258
00:18:18,705 --> 00:18:20,990
- Where?!
- She was right there in the woods!

259
00:18:22,806 --> 00:18:24,192
What's a ghost doing outside?

260
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:25,571
You want to stay
and find out?

261
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:27,791
Everybody inside.

262
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,640
Are you crazy? We need to get
the hell out of here!

263
00:18:30,697 --> 00:18:33,001
In what?!
This ghost is hunting us!

264
00:18:33,806 --> 00:18:35,873
Everybody back inside now!
Move!

265
00:18:39,506 --> 00:18:41,730
Whatever's outside,
it can't get in this circle.

266
00:18:41,777 --> 00:18:43,303
As long as the salt line
is unbroken,

267
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:44,930
this is the safest place to be.

268
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,471
Safe from ghosts?

269
00:18:47,806 --> 00:18:49,542
Yes,
as a matter of fact.

270
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:53,401
Okay. I'm not listening
to this anymore. Come on.

271
00:18:53,438 --> 00:18:55,060
I got to get my family
out of here. Let's go.

272
00:18:55,115 --> 00:18:57,042
Nobody's going anywhere
until we kill this thing.

273
00:18:57,075 --> 00:18:59,901
Sir, please.
This is what we do. Just...

274
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,682
trust us.

275
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:03,680
You hunt ghosts?

276
00:19:04,008 --> 00:19:05,220
That's right.

277
00:19:05,805 --> 00:19:07,133
Like scooby-Doo?

278
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:09,723
Better.

279
00:19:11,006 --> 00:19:12,983
You saw her outside,
right?

280
00:19:13,008 --> 00:19:16,182
Okay. Does she look like
either one of the girls?

281
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:20,483
Her.

282
00:19:20,505 --> 00:19:23,362
She was paler and a lot dirtier,
but that was her.

283
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,753
That's the girl in the walls.

284
00:19:26,106 --> 00:19:27,460
So it's the daughter?

285
00:19:27,507 --> 00:19:31,320
That girl in the picture,
she... she's dead?

286
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:34,893
She killed herself
inside this house.

287
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:41,680
So, what then?

288
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:44,072
The maid got her story wrong?
Rebecca wasn't cremated?

289
00:19:44,106 --> 00:19:46,672
Unless her spirit's just attached
to something inside the house.

290
00:19:46,696 --> 00:19:48,322
She hung herself
in the attic, right?

291
00:19:48,407 --> 00:19:50,223
You want to babysit?
I'll check it out.

292
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,841
Look, I don't care
who hung themselves where.

293
00:19:53,877 --> 00:19:55,283
Maybe something
is going on here,

294
00:19:55,335 --> 00:19:56,243
- but...
- It's a spirit, man.

295
00:19:56,268 --> 00:19:57,932
No, it's just some
backwoods hillbilly bitch,

296
00:19:57,978 --> 00:19:59,361
and I'm not about
to sit around here

297
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:01,782
waiting for her to go
all "deliverance" on my ass.

298
00:20:01,815 --> 00:20:03,720
- Well, nobody's leaving the house.
- Stop me.

299
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,432
Listen, man. I've got a gun.

300
00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:12,611
You don't get your ass
back in that circle,

301
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,361
you're gonna have yourself
a third hole.

302
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:25,152
Dude, you don't have a gun.

303
00:20:25,198 --> 00:20:26,142
And?

304
00:20:26,707 --> 00:20:29,262
I'm not letting that bastard
or anyone else die tonight.

305
00:20:31,107 --> 00:20:32,261
You cool?

306
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:34,573
Go.

307
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,580
Hey. Fonzie.

308
00:20:44,107 --> 00:20:45,483
Question for you.

309
00:20:45,507 --> 00:20:48,641
This indestructible force field
made out of salt...

310
00:20:49,508 --> 00:20:51,531
have to be kosher stuff,
or what?

311
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,051
Knock it off,Ted.

312
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:01,050
What was that?

313
00:21:21,008 --> 00:21:21,811
Mom.

314
00:21:26,707 --> 00:21:28,233
All right,
everybody stay calm.

315
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:30,261
She's a ghost.
She can't come in the circle.

316
00:21:48,806 --> 00:21:50,652
I thought you said ghosts
couldn't cross the circle.

317
00:21:50,748 --> 00:21:52,220
- They can't. She's not a ghost.
- Shoot her!

318
00:21:52,265 --> 00:21:54,241
- Shoot her!
- Yeah, about that...

319
00:21:54,276 --> 00:21:55,531
Go, go, go! Move!

320
00:22:22,705 --> 00:22:24,181
Hey. You okay?

321
00:22:24,267 --> 00:22:25,620
- Where is everybody?
- Hiding.

322
00:22:25,655 --> 00:22:27,501
All right, go get them.
Go. Go get them.

323
00:22:28,506 --> 00:22:30,433
- So, it's not a ghost.
- So, it's just a girl?

324
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:32,181
It's not just a girl.
It's psycho nell.

325
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,091
I'm telling you, man...
Humans.

326
00:22:34,107 --> 00:22:35,442
So, who is she, then?

327
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,242
I don't know. Maybe
it's the daughter, Rebecca.

328
00:22:37,285 --> 00:22:38,343
Maybe she didn't hang herself.

329
00:22:38,377 --> 00:22:40,233
Dude, no. She'd have to be like
50 years old by now.

330
00:22:40,265 --> 00:22:42,190
Well, I don't know.
What'd you find in the attic?

331
00:22:42,206 --> 00:22:44,560
Some old junk.
I found Rebecca's diary.

332
00:22:44,605 --> 00:22:46,652
- That's about it.
- I wish you'd found a howitzer.

333
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:48,251
Listen, we got to get
this family safe.

334
00:22:48,307 --> 00:22:50,193
I mean, it's just a human,
so they can make a run for it.

335
00:22:50,238 --> 00:22:51,272
We just got to hold her off.

336
00:22:51,308 --> 00:22:52,403
We're okay.

337
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:54,211
Danny! Ted! We got to go!

338
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:57,753
- I'm good!
- Danny! Come on!

339
00:22:57,805 --> 00:22:59,303
Danny, buddy, we got to go!

340
00:22:59,365 --> 00:23:00,762
Told you
it was some crazy bitch.

341
00:23:00,795 --> 00:23:02,053
Yes, you did.

342
00:23:02,128 --> 00:23:03,522
Head to town.
We'll take it from here, okay?

343
00:23:03,565 --> 00:23:05,780
Danny, come on, baby!
We're leaving!

344
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:07,142
Danny, we got to go!

345
00:23:13,808 --> 00:23:16,173
Brian, where... Where is he?

346
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:29,461
{\a6}We will find Danny.
I promise you.

347
00:23:29,806 --> 00:23:33,140
{\a6}Take Kate and go now.
Now! While you still have a chance!

348
00:23:33,177 --> 00:23:34,920
{\a6}- Not without Danny! No way!
- We will find him!

349
00:23:34,967 --> 00:23:36,223
{\a6}I am not going out there
with mom alone!

350
00:23:36,307 --> 00:23:37,510
{\a6}She's right. She's right.

351
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:38,582
{\a6}Until we find your son,

352
00:23:38,607 --> 00:23:40,910
{\a6}the safest place for you
right now is in the shed.

353
00:23:41,508 --> 00:23:42,812
I am not going in there,
either.

354
00:23:42,847 --> 00:23:44,583
Yes, you are.
It is the best defense.

355
00:23:44,608 --> 00:23:46,943
The windows are boarded up.
It's got one door.

356
00:23:46,977 --> 00:23:48,563
It's our best shot right now.

357
00:23:48,607 --> 00:23:49,792
Trust me.

358
00:23:50,507 --> 00:23:53,982
Suse, Kate... Go. Go.

359
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,371
All right.

360
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,713
You and me
will take the outside.

361
00:23:57,806 --> 00:23:59,023
You two take the house.

362
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:00,350
Let's go.

363
00:24:10,808 --> 00:24:11,793
What are you doing?

364
00:24:12,508 --> 00:24:14,711
She's human. She had
to come from somewhere.

365
00:24:22,508 --> 00:24:24,872
- You smell that?
- Every day.

366
00:24:48,508 --> 00:24:49,322
Come on.

367
00:25:25,806 --> 00:25:27,401
You're not going down there.

368
00:25:28,906 --> 00:25:30,082
Well, do you want to?

369
00:25:36,006 --> 00:25:38,770
Please nobody grab my leg.
Please nobody grab my leg.

370
00:26:04,906 --> 00:26:05,802
Dog.

371
00:26:06,506 --> 00:26:07,910
It's what's for dinner.

372
00:26:11,805 --> 00:26:12,950
Find anything?

373
00:26:14,805 --> 00:26:16,170
Yeah. Her kitchen.

374
00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:18,541
Her what?

375
00:27:34,808 --> 00:27:37,701
Look... why are we just
standing here?

376
00:27:37,748 --> 00:27:39,281
Let's go in.
Let's check the house.

377
00:27:39,306 --> 00:27:41,882
We have to wait for those guys
to get back, okay?

378
00:27:43,506 --> 00:27:45,380
- Sam, it's me.
- Help me out.

379
00:27:52,608 --> 00:27:53,843
Did you get Danny?

380
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,393
Well, where's Ted?

381
00:28:03,427 --> 00:28:04,611
He's outside.

382
00:28:05,508 --> 00:28:07,381
Well, why doesn't
he come inside?

383
00:28:11,505 --> 00:28:12,983
Because I had to carry him out.

384
00:28:15,008 --> 00:28:15,922
I'm sorry.

385
00:28:18,007 --> 00:28:19,152
What does...
What does that mean?

386
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,790
What does that mean
that you're sorry?

387
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:22,193
Are you saying
that he's dead?

388
00:28:22,508 --> 00:28:24,883
No. He's not saying
that he's dead.

389
00:28:24,918 --> 00:28:26,653
You're not saying that,
are you?

390
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:28,852
We were in the walls,
and she attacked.

391
00:28:30,805 --> 00:28:32,362
And I couldn't get to him
in time.

392
00:28:36,106 --> 00:28:37,592
Uncle Ted is dead?

393
00:28:40,306 --> 00:28:41,941
I shouldn't have
left him alone.

394
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:47,912
I'm very sorry.

395
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:03,503
We'll find him, Suse.
We will.

396
00:29:03,545 --> 00:29:05,160
Where else is there
to look?

397
00:29:06,008 --> 00:29:07,813
- Danny's dead, isn't he?
- No, Suse.

398
00:29:07,905 --> 00:29:08,792
He is. Why not?

399
00:29:08,836 --> 00:29:11,022
She killed my brother,
now she killed my son.

400
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:13,972
- No, Danny is alive.
- No. No, he isn't.

401
00:29:14,007 --> 00:29:15,341
Yes, he is.

402
00:29:15,385 --> 00:29:16,392
Do you remember
what he said

403
00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:18,493
about the girl
who lived in the walls?

404
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,140
She said he could stay.

405
00:29:23,507 --> 00:29:26,210
I just don't understand
why this happens to us.

406
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:30,663
I mean, we're good people.
We're a good family.

407
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:33,180
What happened to Andy
happened, okay?

408
00:29:33,217 --> 00:29:34,783
I cannot change that.

409
00:29:34,808 --> 00:29:37,431
But I will find Danny.
I promise you.

410
00:29:37,808 --> 00:29:40,973
And when I do,
we are gonna be fine.

411
00:29:41,007 --> 00:29:44,642
You and me, the kids?
We're gonna be fine.

412
00:30:02,807 --> 00:30:04,251
Andy your son?

413
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:11,073
Oldest.

414
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:17,521
He got himself killed
in a car accident last year.

415
00:30:20,805 --> 00:30:21,961
I'm sorry.

416
00:30:23,606 --> 00:30:25,712
Nearly tore Suse and I apart.

417
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:28,333
Still could, I imagine.

418
00:30:32,105 --> 00:30:33,952
That's why we moved here.

419
00:30:34,808 --> 00:30:36,401
Fresh air, fresh start.

420
00:30:37,308 --> 00:30:38,822
Not even my line.

421
00:30:39,327 --> 00:30:41,023
Marriage counselor.

422
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,611
Or she might be right.

423
00:30:45,705 --> 00:30:49,703
After all, what could possibly
go wrong in the country?

424
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:55,711
I'm getting your son back.

425
00:30:57,705 --> 00:31:00,202
If it's the last godforsaken thing
I do.

426
00:31:03,358 --> 00:31:05,082
Why do you care so much?

427
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:13,163
We got to talk.

428
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,533
- What is that?
- Rebecca's diary.

429
00:31:16,566 --> 00:31:17,980
I just finished reading it.

430
00:31:18,475 --> 00:31:19,483
And?

431
00:31:20,026 --> 00:31:21,332
That girl back there.

432
00:31:21,935 --> 00:31:23,742
I'm pretty sure
she was Rebecca's daughter.

433
00:31:23,777 --> 00:31:25,911
- Rebecca had a kid?
- It's all she talks about.

434
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:28,732
Being pregnant,
being ashamed of being pregnant.

435
00:31:28,797 --> 00:31:30,632
Geez. Rent "Juno".
Get over it.

436
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,842
Wait... Why kill herself
after the baby?

437
00:31:32,887 --> 00:31:34,881
Maybe because her dad
called her a dirty little whore

438
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:36,100
and said
he was gonna lock the baby up

439
00:31:36,135 --> 00:31:38,440
- where nobody could ever see it.
- Why would he say that?

440
00:31:42,705 --> 00:31:43,802
Oh, gross.

441
00:31:44,526 --> 00:31:46,271
So the daddy
was the baby-daddy, too?

442
00:31:46,348 --> 00:31:48,181
Dude was a monster, Dean.

443
00:31:50,518 --> 00:31:52,301
A storripped
from austrian headlines.

444
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:54,721
Humans, man.

445
00:31:55,568 --> 00:31:57,891
So she's been locked up
in this house her whole life?

446
00:31:57,925 --> 00:31:58,923
You saw her eyes.

447
00:31:58,955 --> 00:32:01,542
Has she ever seen light?
She's barely human.

448
00:32:01,577 --> 00:32:03,510
Okay, so, what, then?
She's kept caged up like an animal,

449
00:32:03,545 --> 00:32:05,781
and then she busts out
and ganks dear, old dad

450
00:32:05,795 --> 00:32:08,100
/granddad?

451
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:09,262
I guess.

452
00:32:09,307 --> 00:32:11,900
- Well, can't say I blame her.
- I'm sure her life was hell, Dean.

453
00:32:11,935 --> 00:32:14,261
That doesn't mean she gets
a free pass for a murder spree.

454
00:32:14,357 --> 00:32:15,662
Like you know what hell's like.

455
00:32:16,197 --> 00:32:17,203
I didn't...

456
00:32:18,015 --> 00:32:19,192
Forget it.

457
00:32:20,596 --> 00:32:22,022
So, where do we find her?

458
00:32:25,825 --> 00:32:27,293
Kid's got to eat, right?

459
00:32:29,386 --> 00:32:30,260
What?

460
00:32:31,478 --> 00:32:33,623
He kept her hidden,
locked up...

461
00:32:33,665 --> 00:32:35,860
But he had to feed her,
didn't he?

462
00:32:35,918 --> 00:32:36,783
I guess.

463
00:32:37,315 --> 00:32:38,462
I think I know where.

464
00:33:56,255 --> 00:33:58,272
{\a6}He could have kept her
hidden down here for years.

465
00:33:58,305 --> 00:34:01,122
{\a6}Kept her fed.
Nobody would ever know.

466
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:08,430
{\a6}- Danny!
- Watch out. I'm going down.

467
00:34:08,438 --> 00:34:10,110
{\a6}- No, that's my son.
- I know it is.

468
00:34:10,146 --> 00:34:11,780
But I said
that I would get him.

469
00:34:11,827 --> 00:34:14,340
I will. Let me.

470
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:39,782
You got curtains?

471
00:34:39,858 --> 00:34:41,041
We need rope.

472
00:35:02,978 --> 00:35:04,452
It's okay. Shh.

473
00:35:04,486 --> 00:35:05,993
It's okay, baby.

474
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:20,362
Bitch is a klepto.

475
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:03,672
Your dad's upstairs.
Come on.

476
00:36:08,216 --> 00:36:09,751
Hurry!
He's coming back!

477
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,382
"He"?

478
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:13,371
Her brother!

479
00:36:49,805 --> 00:36:50,880
Come on, buddy.

480
00:36:50,896 --> 00:36:53,283
Come on, buddy.
Don't look back, Danny.

481
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:54,412
Just don't look down.

482
00:37:01,755 --> 00:37:02,540
Mom!

483
00:37:06,198 --> 00:37:07,180
Mom!

484
00:37:08,495 --> 00:37:09,773
Come on. I got you.

485
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:12,361
You okay?

486
00:37:12,845 --> 00:37:13,780
It's okay.

487
00:37:14,338 --> 00:37:16,101
Get him out of here.
You got to go.

488
00:38:02,598 --> 00:38:04,243
Mom!

489
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:17,430
Suse!

490
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:21,380
{\a6}Thanks for the head start.

491
00:39:21,956 --> 00:39:24,653
{\a6}Why doesn't it surprise me
you guys don't like the police?

492
00:39:24,688 --> 00:39:26,093
Sort of a, uh...

493
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:28,482
mutual-appreciation thing,
really.

494
00:39:30,437 --> 00:39:31,561
Thank you.

495
00:39:31,907 --> 00:39:33,032
Thank you.

496
00:39:33,677 --> 00:39:34,750
You okay?

497
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:40,602
No. We're the opposite
of okay. But...

498
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:42,873
We're together.

499
00:40:12,937 --> 00:40:13,881
You okay?

500
00:40:14,487 --> 00:40:16,882
You know, I felt for
those sons of bitches back there.

501
00:40:18,415 --> 00:40:20,953
Lifelong torture turns you
into something like that.

502
00:40:23,025 --> 00:40:24,830
You were in hell, Dean.

503
00:40:27,518 --> 00:40:29,822
Look, maybe you did
what you did there...

504
00:40:31,026 --> 00:40:32,470
But you're not them.

505
00:40:33,065 --> 00:40:34,713
They were barely human.

506
00:40:35,216 --> 00:40:36,502
Well, you're right.

507
00:40:36,575 --> 00:40:37,981
I wasn't like them.

508
00:40:39,148 --> 00:40:40,491
I was worse.

509
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:44,193
They were animals, Sam,
defending territory. Me...

510
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:47,793
I did it
for the sheer pleasure of it.

511
00:40:49,537 --> 00:40:50,652
What?

512
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,173
I enjoyed it, Sam.

513
00:40:55,797 --> 00:40:58,020
They took meff the rack,
and I tortured souls,

514
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:59,383
and I liked it.

515
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,931
All those years...

516
00:41:04,618 --> 00:41:06,093
All that pain...

517
00:41:06,916 --> 00:41:09,233
Finally getting
to deal some out yourself.

518
00:41:10,797 --> 00:41:12,812
I didn't care
who they put in front of me.

519
00:41:14,336 --> 00:41:16,923
Because that f...
That pain I felt?

520
00:41:17,867 --> 00:41:19,441
It just slipped away.

521
00:41:22,338 --> 00:41:24,623
No matter
how many people I save...

522
00:41:26,288 --> 00:41:27,870
I can't change that.

523
00:41:30,866 --> 00:41:32,700
I can't fill this hole.

524
00:41:36,268 --> 00:41:37,383
Not ever.
