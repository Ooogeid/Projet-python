1
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,228
You're gonna suck it up,
accept your responsibilities,

2
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,440
and play the roles
that destiny has chosen for you.

3
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,151
- You're the vessel. Michael's vessel.
- The answer's no.

4
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,654
- You know who I am. You're the one Sam.
- Lucifer.

5
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:32,195
- You're my vessel.
- That'll never happen.

6
00:00:38,258 --> 00:00:40,081
Hi, Lisa.
Things are about to get bad.

7
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:42,541
- Whatever you're thinking, don't do it.
- I have to.

8
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:45,867
The cage you sprung Lucifer from...
You can shove his ass back in.

9
00:00:45,992 --> 00:00:47,755
The key to the cage? Four rings

10
00:00:48,057 --> 00:00:49,173
From the horsemen.

11
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:50,716
- Who is it?
- Our brother.

12
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,760
- Adam is gone?
- The angels took him.

13
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,470
They're moving on from you, Dean.

14
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:57,321
- Think Adam's okay?
- Doubt it.

15
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,853
What if you lead the devil to the edge
and I jump in?

16
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,980
Are you eejits trying to kill me?

17
00:01:08,572 --> 00:01:10,313
You're going to let your brother

18
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:12,488
jump right into that fiery pit.

19
00:01:12,842 --> 00:01:14,365
What exactly are you afraid of?

20
00:01:14,813 --> 00:01:16,867
Losing? Or losing your brother?

21
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:28,337
On April 21, 1967,

22
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:31,283
the 100 millionth GM vehicle
rolled off the line

23
00:01:31,408 --> 00:01:33,050
at the plant in Janesville.

24
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,918
A blue two-door Caprice.

25
00:01:35,944 --> 00:01:37,763
There was a big ceremony, speeches.

26
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:41,069
The lieutenant governor
even showed up.

27
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,895
Three days later, another car
rolled off that Same line.

28
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:47,648
No one gave two craps about her.

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,192
But they should have.

30
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:53,491
Because this 1967 Chevrolet Impala

31
00:01:53,616 --> 00:01:55,948
would turn out to be
the most important car... 

32
00:01:57,296 --> 00:01:59,751
No, the most important object...

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,320
In pretty much the whole universe.

34
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,100
She was first owned by Sal Moriarty,

35
00:02:05,812 --> 00:02:09,262
an alcoholic with two ex-wives
and three blocked arteries.

36
00:02:09,976 --> 00:02:13,174
On weekends, he'd drive around
giving bibles to the poor.

37
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,981
"Getting folks right
for Judgment Day."

38
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:17,606
That's what he said.

39
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,632
Sam and Dean don't know any of this,
but if they did,

40
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:21,932
I bet they'd smile.

41
00:02:22,915 --> 00:02:26,020
After Sal died,
she ended up at Rainbow Motors,

42
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,939
a used-car lot in Lawrence,

43
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:31,839
where a young marine
bought her on impulse.

44
00:02:31,964 --> 00:02:32,964
That is,

45
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,321
after a little advice from a friend.

46
00:02:36,743 --> 00:02:39,241
I guess that's where
this story begins.

47
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,785
And here's where it ends.

48
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,416
Dean?

49
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,441
What's going on?

50
00:03:06,238 --> 00:03:07,238
I'm in.

51
00:03:10,446 --> 00:03:13,108
- In with?
- The whole "up with Satan" thing.

52
00:03:13,646 --> 00:03:14,796
I'm on board.

53
00:03:17,223 --> 00:03:18,990
You're gonna let me say yes?

54
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,052
No. That's the thing.

55
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:23,627
It's not on me
to let you do anything.

56
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:28,688
You're a grown...
Well, overgrown man.

57
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:33,193
If this is what you want,
I'll back your play.

58
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:36,196
That's the last thing
I thought you'd ever say.

59
00:03:36,938 --> 00:03:37,938
Might be.

60
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:42,949
I'm not gonna lie to you, though.
It goes against every fiber I got.

61
00:03:46,256 --> 00:03:47,706
I mean, truth is...

62
00:03:51,035 --> 00:03:53,085
You know, watching out for you.

63
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:57,000
It's kinda been my job, you know?

64
00:03:58,534 --> 00:04:00,384
But more than that, it's...

65
00:04:00,802 --> 00:04:02,302
It's kinda who I am.

66
00:04:03,906 --> 00:04:05,872
You're not a kid anymore, Sam,

67
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:08,497
and I can't keep
treating you like one.

68
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:13,961
Maybe I got to grow up a little,
too.

69
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:20,551
I don't know
if we got a snowball's chance.

70
00:04:21,023 --> 00:04:22,023
But...

71
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:26,557
But I know
that if anybody can do it,

72
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,309
it's you.

73
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:32,971
Thank you.

74
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:35,937
If this is what you want...

75
00:04:38,095 --> 00:04:40,029
Is this really what you want?

76
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,742
I let him out.

77
00:04:47,674 --> 00:04:49,424
I got to put him back in.

78
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,810
That's it, then.

79
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:08,974
= 522 =

80
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:13,451
= Supernatural Team =

81
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:45,956
I still can't get used to you
at eye level.

82
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,890
- So, was I right?
- As always, Yoda.

83
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,407
Two stunt demons inside,
just like you said.

84
00:05:51,532 --> 00:05:52,782
Did you get it?

85
00:05:53,976 --> 00:05:56,063
All the "go juice" Sammy can drink.

86
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:58,941
You okay?

87
00:05:59,545 --> 00:06:01,064
Not really. What do you got?

88
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,236
Not much.
These look like omens to you?

89
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:06,949
Cyclone in Florida,
temperature drop in Detroit,

90
00:06:07,502 --> 00:06:08,802
wildfires in LA.

91
00:06:08,927 --> 00:06:11,274
- What about Detroit?
- Temp's dropped about 20 degrees.

92
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:14,424
But only in a five-block radius
of downtown Motown.

93
00:06:14,549 --> 00:06:15,799
That's the one.

94
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:18,399
- Devil's in Detroit.
- Really?

95
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,460
As far as foreboding goes,

96
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:22,589
it's a little light in the loafers.
You sure?

97
00:06:23,572 --> 00:06:24,822
Yeah, I'm sure.

98
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,808
Ain't he a little angel?

99
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:47,868
Angels don't sleep.

100
00:06:56,603 --> 00:06:58,903
Sam, I got a bad feeling about this.

101
00:06:59,707 --> 00:07:02,607
- You'd be nuts not to.
- You know what I mean.

102
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:03,964
Detroit.

103
00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:06,983
He always said
he'd jump your bones in Detroit.

104
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:09,108
- Here we are.
- Here we are.

105
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:11,085
Maybe he's rolling out
the red carpet

106
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,753
Maybe he knows something we don't.

107
00:07:12,878 --> 00:07:15,628
Dean, I'm sure
he knows a buttload we don't.

108
00:07:16,526 --> 00:07:18,982
We just gotta hope
he doesn't know about the rings.

109
00:07:29,572 --> 00:07:32,065
On the subject, there's something
I got to talk to you about.

110
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,290
This thing goes our way and I...

111
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:36,806
Triple lindy into that box,

112
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:40,918
you know I'm not coming back.

113
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,547
- I'm aware.
- So you got to promise me something.

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,550
Okay. Yeah. Anything.

115
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,870
Promise not to try to bring me back.

116
00:07:56,107 --> 00:07:57,107
What?

117
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:59,437
I didn't sign up for that.

118
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,939
Your hell is gonna make my tour
look like Graceland.

119
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:04,328
You want me to sit by
and do nothing?

120
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:06,655
Once the cage is shut,
you can't go poking at it.

121
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,613
- It's too risky.
- As if I'm gonna let you rot in there!

122
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,116
- You don't have a choice.
- You can't ask me to do this.

123
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:13,659
I'm sorry. You have to.

124
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,164
So then what am I supposed to do?

125
00:08:20,262 --> 00:08:21,612
You go find Lisa.

126
00:08:21,737 --> 00:08:24,174
You pray to God
she's dumb enough to take you in,

127
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:27,299
and you have barbecues,
and go to football games.

128
00:08:27,933 --> 00:08:30,783
You go live some normal,
apple-pie life, Dean.

129
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:34,863
Promise me.

130
00:08:54,202 --> 00:08:56,660
Demons. At least two dozen of them.

131
00:08:57,289 --> 00:09:00,038
- You were right, something's up.
- More than something.

132
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:01,874
He's here. I know it.

133
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,520
See ya around, kid.

134
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:25,819
See ya around.

135
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,450
He gets in...

136
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:40,078
You fight him tooth and nail,
you understand?

137
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,446
Keep swinging.

138
00:09:42,401 --> 00:09:44,208
- Don't give an inch.
- Yes, sir.

139
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,638
Take care of these guys, okay?

140
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:01,398
That's not possible.

141
00:10:04,308 --> 00:10:05,508
Then humor me.

142
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,400
Oh, I was supposed to lie.

143
00:10:12,114 --> 00:10:14,037
Sure. They'll be fine.

144
00:10:14,162 --> 00:10:16,240
Just stop talking.

145
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,174
You mind not watching this?

146
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:54,847
Let's go.

147
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:04,301
All right!

148
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,957
We're here, you sons of bitches!

149
00:11:08,082 --> 00:11:09,382
Come and get it!

150
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:14,739
Hey, guys.

151
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:16,925
Is your father home?

152
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:28,048
Hey, guys.

153
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:30,480
So nice of you to drop in.

154
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:36,967


155
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,981
The Impala, of course,
has all the things other cars have.

156
00:11:42,106 --> 00:11:44,006
And a few things they don't.

157
00:11:45,502 --> 00:11:47,446
But none of that stuff's important.

158
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:50,049
This is the stuff that's important.

159
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,126
The army man that Sam
crammed in the ashtray.

160
00:11:53,251 --> 00:11:54,463
It's still there.

161
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,923
The Legos
Dean shoved into the vents.

162
00:11:57,322 --> 00:12:00,093
To this day, heat comes on
and they can hear 'em rattle.

163
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:03,221
These are the things
that make the car theirs.

164
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,380
Really theirs.

165
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:07,984
When Dean rebuilt her
from the ground up,

166
00:12:08,109 --> 00:12:10,687
he made sure
all these little things stayed.

167
00:12:11,093 --> 00:12:13,440
Cause it's the blemishes
that make her beautiful.

168
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:19,339
The devil doesn't know or care
what kind of car the boys drive.

169
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,241
Sorry if it's a bit chilly.

170
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,027
Most people think I burn hot.

171
00:12:27,004 --> 00:12:28,955
It's actually quite the opposite.

172
00:12:29,607 --> 00:12:30,791
I'll alert the media.

173
00:12:38,194 --> 00:12:40,171
Help me understand something, guys.

174
00:12:40,296 --> 00:12:43,046
I mean,
stomping through my front door is...

175
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:45,566
A tad suicidal, don't you think?

176
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:47,757
We're not here to fight you.

177
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,187
- Then why are you?
- I want to say yes.

178
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:54,605
Excuse me?

179
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,783
- Chock-full of Ovaltine, are we?
- You heard me.

180
00:13:05,837 --> 00:13:06,837
Yes.

181
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:08,371
You're serious.

182
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:14,255
Look, Judgment Day
is a runaway train.

183
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,580
We get it now.

184
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,137
- We just want off.
- Meaning?

185
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:20,480
Deal of the century.

186
00:13:20,605 --> 00:13:23,027
I give you a free ride,
but when it's all over,

187
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:25,824
I live, he lives,
you bring our parents back...

188
00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:27,722
Can we please drop the telenovela?

189
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,143
I know you have the rings, Sam.

190
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,011
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

191
00:13:38,953 --> 00:13:40,503
The horsemen's rings?

192
00:13:42,861 --> 00:13:44,661
The magic keys to my cage?

193
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,000
Ring a bell?

194
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:51,840
Come on, Sam.
I've never lied to you.

195
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:53,707
You could pay me the same respect.

196
00:13:56,317 --> 00:13:57,967
It's okay. I'm not mad.

197
00:13:58,668 --> 00:14:01,068
A wrestling match
inside your noggin.

198
00:14:01,338 --> 00:14:04,050
I like the idea. Just you and me...

199
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:05,568
One round,

200
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,210
no tricks.

201
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:10,427
You win, you jump in the hole.

202
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:11,552
I win...

203
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:14,111
Well, then I win.

204
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,522
What do you say?

205
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,149
A fiddle of gold against your soul

206
00:14:20,274 --> 00:14:21,818
says I'm better than you.

207
00:14:27,393 --> 00:14:29,451
So he knows.
Doesn't change anything.

208
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,328
We don't have any other choice.

209
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:36,359
Yes.

210
00:15:19,572 --> 00:15:20,822
I can feel him.

211
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,630
- Oh, God!
- You gotta go now!

212
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:25,758
Come on!

213
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,210
Go now, Sammy.

214
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,660
Now!

215
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:52,993
I was just messing with you.

216
00:15:54,762 --> 00:15:56,162
Sammy's long gone.

217
00:16:30,446 --> 00:16:31,596
I told you...

218
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,370
This would always happen in Detroit.

219
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:07,776
Come on.

220
00:17:09,084 --> 00:17:10,434
I can feel you...

221
00:17:11,274 --> 00:17:13,024
Scratching away in there.

222
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:18,179
Look...

223
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,960
I'll take the gag off, okay?

224
00:17:28,258 --> 00:17:30,158
You got me all wrong, kiddo.

225
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,300
I'm not the bad guy.

226
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,837
I'm gonna rip you apart
from the inside out.

227
00:17:34,962 --> 00:17:36,512
Do you understand me?

228
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,530
Such anger...

229
00:17:41,412 --> 00:17:42,712
Young Skywalker.

230
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:50,219
Who are you really angry with? Me?

231
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:52,779
Or that face in the mirror?

232
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,797
- This is all a big joke to you?
- Not at all.

233
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,534
I've been waiting for you.

234
00:17:58,242 --> 00:17:59,292
For a long,

235
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,002
long time.

236
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:04,079
Come on, Sam.

237
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,833
You have to admit...

238
00:18:06,578 --> 00:18:08,972
You can feel it, right?

239
00:18:09,564 --> 00:18:11,464
- What?
- The exhilaration.

240
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,508
And you know why?

241
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,510
Because we're two halves made whole.

242
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,094
MFEO

243
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:20,225
Literally.

244
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,750
This feels
pretty damn far from good.

245
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:24,976
I'm inside your grapefruit, Sam.

246
00:18:26,427 --> 00:18:27,927
You can't lie to me.

247
00:18:29,795 --> 00:18:30,945
I see it all.

248
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,544
How odd you always felt;

249
00:18:34,685 --> 00:18:35,685
How...

250
00:18:37,171 --> 00:18:38,821
Out of place in that...

251
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:40,969
Family of yours.

252
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:44,956
And why shouldn't you have?

253
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,125
They were foster care, at best.

254
00:18:48,797 --> 00:18:50,347
I'm your real family.

255
00:18:51,065 --> 00:18:52,505
- That's not true.
- It is.

256
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,300
And I know you know it.

257
00:18:56,608 --> 00:18:58,094
All those times you ran away,

258
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,906
you weren't running from them.

259
00:19:00,497 --> 00:19:02,397
You were running towards me.

260
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:09,840
This doesn't have to be a bad thing,
you know.

261
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:12,359
I let Dean live, didn't I?

262
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:13,943
I want him to live.

263
00:19:14,683 --> 00:19:16,404
I'll bring your folks back, too.

264
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:20,450
I want you to be happy, Sam.

265
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,645
I don't want anything from you.

266
00:19:25,268 --> 00:19:26,268
Really?

267
00:19:29,218 --> 00:19:30,710
Not even a little payback?

268
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:33,915
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Look closely.

269
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,243
None of these little devils
look familiar to you?

270
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,315
That's Mr. Bensman...

271
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,982
One of my grade-school teachers.

272
00:19:48,107 --> 00:19:50,730
And that's your friend Doug
from that time in East Lansing.

273
00:19:51,813 --> 00:19:52,863
And Rachel.

274
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,001
Your prom date.

275
00:19:56,983 --> 00:19:59,183
Sam Winchester, this is your life.

276
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:01,574
Azazel's gang.

277
00:20:02,314 --> 00:20:04,714
Watching you
since you were a rugrat,

278
00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:08,915
jerking you around
like a dog on a leash.

279
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,585
I know how you feel about them.

280
00:20:13,275 --> 00:20:14,275
Me too.

281
00:20:15,584 --> 00:20:18,174
So, what do you say you and I
blow off a little steam?

282
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,886
Reports are flooding in.
A 7.6 earthquake in Portland,

283
00:20:24,071 --> 00:20:25,271
8.1 in Boston,

284
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:27,967
more in Hong Kong,
Berlin, and Tehran.

285
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:29,942
The USGS has no explanation

286
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:32,622
but says to expect
a six-figure death toll.

287
00:20:32,747 --> 00:20:33,815
It's starting.

288
00:20:35,248 --> 00:20:36,648
You think, genius?

289
00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:38,444
You don't have to be mean.

290
00:20:38,623 --> 00:20:40,023
What do we do now?

291
00:20:42,562 --> 00:20:45,612
I suggest we imbibe
copious quantities of alcohol.

292
00:20:47,577 --> 00:20:49,652
Just wait
for the inevitable blast wave.

293
00:20:49,777 --> 00:20:51,524
Swell. Thank you, Bukowski.

294
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:53,049
How do we stop it?

295
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:57,714
We don't.

296
00:20:59,085 --> 00:21:01,935
Lucifer will meet Michael
on the chosen field,

297
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,809
and the battle of Armageddon begins.

298
00:21:04,934 --> 00:21:06,556
Where's this chosen field?

299
00:21:07,435 --> 00:21:10,141
- I don't know.
- There's gotta be something we can do.

300
00:21:11,315 --> 00:21:12,557
I'm sorry, Dean.

301
00:21:12,682 --> 00:21:13,832
This is over.

302
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,773
You listen to me, sissy...

303
00:21:16,134 --> 00:21:17,567
We are not giving up!

304
00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:19,369
Bobby?

305
00:21:28,302 --> 00:21:30,538
There was never much hope
to begin with.

306
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,609
I don't know what else to do.

307
00:21:59,244 --> 00:22:00,244
So...

308
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,878
Are we having fun yet?

309
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:08,673


310
00:22:10,053 --> 00:22:11,242
In between jobs,

311
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:13,533
Sam and Dean
would sometimes get a day,

312
00:22:13,658 --> 00:22:15,625
sometimes a week,
if they were lucky.

313
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,044
They'd pass the time
lining their pockets.

314
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,838
Sam used to insist on honest work,
but...

315
00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:23,879
Now he hustles pool,
like his brother.

316
00:22:24,425 --> 00:22:26,565
They could go anywhere
and do anything.

317
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,173
They drove 1,000 miles
for an Ozzy show,

318
00:22:29,298 --> 00:22:31,248
two days for a Jayhawks game.

319
00:22:33,612 --> 00:22:34,941
And when it was clear,

320
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:37,168
they'd park
in the middle of nowhere,

321
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,382
sit on the hood,
and watch the stars.

322
00:22:41,484 --> 00:22:42,484
For hours.

323
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,560
Without saying a word.

324
00:22:48,423 --> 00:22:50,596
It never occurred to them
that, sure,

325
00:22:50,721 --> 00:22:53,371
maybe they never really had a roof
and four walls,

326
00:22:54,303 --> 00:22:56,803
but they were never,
in fact, homeless.

327
00:23:00,095 --> 00:23:01,545
That's a good line.

328
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:08,418
Mistress Magda?

329
00:23:09,109 --> 00:23:10,109
No, Chuck.

330
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,310
I didn't know that you'd call.

331
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,645
Who's mistress Magda?

332
00:23:17,886 --> 00:23:19,336
Nothing. She's a...

333
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,691
Just a... A close friend.

334
00:23:22,455 --> 00:23:25,445
- I'll bet. What happened to Becky?
- Didn't work out.

335
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:28,081
I had too much respect for her.

336
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,901
You got a whole
virgin/hooker thing going on.

337
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:32,493
This can't be why you called.

338
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:35,314
Sam said yes.

339
00:23:35,943 --> 00:23:36,943
I know.

340
00:23:37,593 --> 00:23:38,593
I saw it.

341
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,918
I'm working on the pages.

342
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:43,046
Did you see where the fight
goes down?

343
00:23:44,096 --> 00:23:46,892
The angels are keeping it top secret.
Very hush-hush.

344
00:23:47,017 --> 00:23:49,067
- Crap.
- But I saw it anyway.

345
00:23:49,644 --> 00:23:51,394
Perks of being a prophet.

346
00:23:52,396 --> 00:23:53,596
It's tomorrow.

347
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:54,974
High noon.

348
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,390
Place called Stull Cemetery.

349
00:23:58,219 --> 00:23:59,369
Stull Ceme...

350
00:24:00,093 --> 00:24:01,172
I know that.

351
00:24:01,297 --> 00:24:03,471
That's an old bone-yard
outside of Lawrence.

352
00:24:04,283 --> 00:24:05,860
- Why Lawrence?
- I don't know.

353
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:08,654
It all has to end
where it started, I guess.

354
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,616
- Any way to short-circuit this thing?
- Besides the rings?

355
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:15,286
- I'm sorry.
- Any idea what happens next?

356
00:24:15,841 --> 00:24:17,241
I wish that I did.

357
00:24:18,258 --> 00:24:19,874
But I honestly don't know yet.

358
00:24:21,843 --> 00:24:23,593
All right. Thanks, Chuck.

359
00:24:30,132 --> 00:24:31,632
You going someplace?

360
00:24:35,903 --> 00:24:37,937
You're going to do something stupid.

361
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:39,462
You got that look.

362
00:24:40,828 --> 00:24:42,578
I'm gonna go talk to Sam.

363
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:44,887
- You just don't give up.
- It's Sam!

364
00:24:45,012 --> 00:24:47,944
If you couldn't reach him here,
you won't be able to on the battlefield.

365
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:51,197
If we've already lost,
I guess I got nothing to lose, right?

366
00:24:53,134 --> 00:24:55,234
I just want you to understand...

367
00:24:56,176 --> 00:24:59,026
The only thing
that you're gonna see out there

368
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:01,916
is Michael killing your brother.

369
00:25:06,325 --> 00:25:08,297
Then
I ain't gonna let him die alone.

370
00:25:49,918 --> 00:25:51,299
It's good to see you, Michael.

371
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,176
You too.

372
00:25:54,565 --> 00:25:55,720
It's been too long.

373
00:25:56,018 --> 00:25:58,218
Can you believe it's finally here?

374
00:26:02,068 --> 00:26:03,118
Not really.

375
00:26:06,844 --> 00:26:08,044
Are you ready?

376
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,705
As I'll ever be.

377
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:19,994
A part of me wishes
we didn't have to do this.

378
00:26:23,908 --> 00:26:24,908
Me too.

379
00:26:26,065 --> 00:26:28,294
- Then why are we?
- You know why.

380
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:33,205
- I have no choice, after what you did.
- What I did?

381
00:26:34,267 --> 00:26:36,765
- What if it's not my fault?
- What is that supposed to mean?

382
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,097
Think about it. Dad made everything.

383
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:41,775
Which means

384
00:26:42,037 --> 00:26:44,602
He made me who I am.

385
00:26:45,201 --> 00:26:47,230
God wanted the devil.

386
00:26:48,394 --> 00:26:50,034
- So?
- So why?

387
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:52,276
And why make us fight?

388
00:26:53,103 --> 00:26:55,303
I just can't figure out the point.

389
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,556
What's your point?

390
00:26:59,996 --> 00:27:01,707
We're going to kill each other.

391
00:27:01,832 --> 00:27:02,982
And for what?

392
00:27:03,612 --> 00:27:05,062
One of dad's tests.

393
00:27:06,478 --> 00:27:08,678
And we don't even know the answer.

394
00:27:10,078 --> 00:27:11,212
We're brothers.

395
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,423
Let's just walk off the chessboard.

396
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,357
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

397
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,521
I'm a good son,
and I have my orders.

398
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:32,693
- You don't have to follow them.
- What, you think I'm gonna rebel? Now?

399
00:27:33,746 --> 00:27:35,096
I'm not like you.

400
00:27:35,504 --> 00:27:38,406
You know, you haven't changed a bit,
little brother.

401
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:40,866
Always blaming everybody
but yourself.

402
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,661
We were together. We were happy.

403
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,587
But you betrayed me, all of us...

404
00:27:45,712 --> 00:27:48,822
- And you made our father leave.
- No one makes dad do anything.

405
00:27:48,947 --> 00:27:51,252
He is doing this to us.

406
00:27:55,191 --> 00:27:56,991
You're a monster, Lucifer.

407
00:27:58,917 --> 00:28:00,567
And I have to kill you.

408
00:28:01,772 --> 00:28:03,514
If that's the way it's got to be...

409
00:28:06,761 --> 00:28:08,711
Then I'd like to see you try.

410
00:29:13,468 --> 00:29:15,718
Sorry, am I interrupting something?

411
00:29:16,295 --> 00:29:17,295


412
00:29:20,081 --> 00:29:21,381
We need to talk.

413
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,520
Even for you,

414
00:29:31,586 --> 00:29:33,729
this is a whole new mountain
of stupid.

415
00:29:34,095 --> 00:29:36,690
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to Sam.

416
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,058
You're no longer the vessel, Dean.

417
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,945
You got no right to be here.

418
00:29:43,321 --> 00:29:45,659
Adam, if you're in there somewhere,
I am so sorry.

419
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,368
Adam isn't home right now.

420
00:29:47,641 --> 00:29:49,171
Then you're next on my list.

421
00:29:49,296 --> 00:29:52,164
- But now, I need five minutes with him.
- You little maggot.

422
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,625
You are no longer
a part of this story!

423
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:56,669
Ass-butt!

424
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,058
Ass-butt?

425
00:30:12,653 --> 00:30:14,478
He'll be back... And upset...

426
00:30:15,026 --> 00:30:16,814
But you got your five minutes.

427
00:30:17,157 --> 00:30:18,157
Castiel.

428
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,578
Did you just molotov my brother

429
00:30:23,786 --> 00:30:25,036
with holy fire?

430
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:29,717
No one dicks with Michael

431
00:30:30,339 --> 00:30:31,339
but me.

432
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:46,193
Sammy, can you hear me?

433
00:30:50,238 --> 00:30:51,288
You know...

434
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:53,489
I tried to be nice.

435
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,619
For Sammy's sake.

436
00:30:56,516 --> 00:30:57,516
But you...

437
00:30:58,449 --> 00:30:59,849
Are such a pain...

438
00:31:02,158 --> 00:31:03,158
In my ass.

439
00:31:31,853 --> 00:31:32,853
Sammy?

440
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,019
- Are you in there?
- He's in here, all right.

441
00:31:38,806 --> 00:31:41,106
And he's gonna feel
the snap of your bones.

442
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,253
Every single one.

443
00:31:48,513 --> 00:31:50,313
We're gonna take our time.

444
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,309
Sam, it's okay.

445
00:31:58,872 --> 00:32:00,372
It's okay. I'm here.

446
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,700
I'm here.

447
00:32:01,964 --> 00:32:03,295
I'm not gonna leave you.

448
00:32:05,454 --> 00:32:06,757
I'm not gonna leave you.

449
00:33:20,636 --> 00:33:21,936
It's okay, Dean.

450
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,451
It's gonna be okay.

451
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:27,796
I've got him.

452
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,660
It's not gonna end this way!

453
00:34:16,563 --> 00:34:18,639
- Step back!
- You're gonna have to make me!

454
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,907
I have to fight my brother, Sam!

455
00:34:21,396 --> 00:34:22,546
Here and now!

456
00:34:23,252 --> 00:34:24,552
It's my destiny!

457
00:35:25,862 --> 00:35:26,862


458
00:35:43,002 --> 00:35:44,308
Cass, you're alive?

459
00:35:45,606 --> 00:35:47,156
I'm better than that.

460
00:36:03,352 --> 00:36:04,620
Cass, are you God?

461
00:36:05,982 --> 00:36:07,592
That's a nice compliment.

462
00:36:07,717 --> 00:36:08,717
But no.

463
00:36:09,981 --> 00:36:12,631
Although, I do believe
He brought me back.

464
00:36:16,378 --> 00:36:17,728
New and improved.

465
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:49,601
Endings are hard.

466
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:54,037
Any chapped-ass monkey
with a keyboard

467
00:36:54,162 --> 00:36:56,865
can poop out a beginning,
but endings are impossible.

468
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,991
You try to tie up every loose end,

469
00:37:00,116 --> 00:37:01,288
but you never can.

470
00:37:01,413 --> 00:37:03,187
The fans are always gonna bitch.

471
00:37:03,312 --> 00:37:04,892
There's always gonna be holes.

472
00:37:05,771 --> 00:37:08,390
And since it's the ending,
it's supposed to add up to something.

473
00:37:08,515 --> 00:37:10,686
I'm telling you,
they're a raging pain in the ass.

474
00:37:15,897 --> 00:37:17,697
What are you gonna do now?

475
00:37:18,753 --> 00:37:20,653
Return to Heaven, I suppose.

476
00:37:21,066 --> 00:37:22,066
Heaven?

477
00:37:22,191 --> 00:37:24,868
With Michael in the cage,
I'm sure it's total anarchy up there.

478
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,043
You're the new sheriff in town?

479
00:37:28,986 --> 00:37:30,455
I like that. I suppose I am.

480
00:37:32,193 --> 00:37:34,396
God gives you a brand-new,
shiny set of wings,

481
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:35,848
and you're his bitch again.

482
00:37:35,973 --> 00:37:37,754
I don't know what God wants.

483
00:37:38,441 --> 00:37:41,050
I don't know if He'll even return.
It just...

484
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:44,632
- Seems like the right thing to do.
- Well, if you do see Him,

485
00:37:44,757 --> 00:37:47,157
you tell Him
I'm coming for Him next.

486
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:50,017
You're angry.

487
00:37:52,394 --> 00:37:54,794
- That's an understatement.
- He helped.

488
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:58,066
- Maybe even more than we realize.
- Easy for you, He brought you back.

489
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,770
But what about Sam? What about me?

490
00:38:01,268 --> 00:38:02,906
Where's my grand prize?

491
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,407
All I got is my brother in a hole!

492
00:38:06,805 --> 00:38:08,955
You got what you asked for, Dean.

493
00:38:09,985 --> 00:38:11,085
No paradise.

494
00:38:11,754 --> 00:38:12,754
No hell

495
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,433
Just more of the Same.

496
00:38:17,491 --> 00:38:18,791
I mean it, Dean.

497
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:20,982
What would you rather have?

498
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,820
Peace

499
00:38:23,391 --> 00:38:24,441
or freedom?

500
00:38:33,004 --> 00:38:36,004
Well, you really suck at goodbyes,
you know that?

501
00:38:43,174 --> 00:38:46,281
This is the last Dean and Bobby
will see of each other for a long time.

502
00:38:52,694 --> 00:38:55,020
And, for the record,
at this point next week,

503
00:38:55,145 --> 00:38:58,121
Bobby will be hunting a rugaru
outside of Dayton.

504
00:38:58,246 --> 00:38:59,396
But not Dean.

505
00:39:00,003 --> 00:39:01,797
Dean didn't want Cass to save him.

506
00:39:02,347 --> 00:39:05,547
Every part of him,
every fiber he's got, wants to die

507
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:08,139
or find a way to bring Sam back.

508
00:39:08,452 --> 00:39:10,305
But he isn't gonna do either.

509
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:12,817
Because he made a promise.

510
00:39:22,949 --> 00:39:23,949
Hey, Lisa.

511
00:39:24,777 --> 00:39:25,777
Thank God.

512
00:39:27,186 --> 00:39:28,586
Are you all right?

513
00:39:33,485 --> 00:39:35,135
If it's not too late...

514
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,792
I think I'd like
to take you up on that beer.

515
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,860
It's never too late.

516
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:52,848
It's okay.

517
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,570
It's gonna be okay.

518
00:40:00,461 --> 00:40:02,361
So, what's it all add up to?

519
00:40:02,486 --> 00:40:03,836
It's hard to say.

520
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:06,459
But me, I'd say this was a test.

521
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,540
For Sam and Dean.

522
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,450
And I think they did all right.

523
00:40:12,137 --> 00:40:13,737
Up against good, evil,

524
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,662
angels, devils,

525
00:40:15,897 --> 00:40:16,897
destiny,

526
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:18,290
and God Himself,

527
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:21,376
they made their own choice.

528
00:40:22,449 --> 00:40:23,849
They chose family.

529
00:40:25,161 --> 00:40:26,311
And, well... 

530
00:40:27,153 --> 00:40:29,303
isn't that kinda the whole point?

531
00:40:36,571 --> 00:40:38,521
No doubt... Endings are hard.

532
00:40:39,914 --> 00:40:41,314
But then again... 

533
00:40:42,312 --> 00:40:44,731
Nothing ever really ends, does it?

534
00:40:57,646 --> 00:40:58,646
You okay?

535
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,960
Yeah, I'm good.
