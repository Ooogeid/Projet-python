1
00:00:01,983 --> 00:00:05,066
You think i'll take one look at a
demon and suddenly all off the wagon,

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:07,732
as if, after everything,
i haven't learned my lesson.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,266
Have you?

4
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:11,344
This is my girlfriend, jessica.

5
00:00:12,705 --> 00:00:14,180
So, what are you gonna do?

6
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:16,574
You just gonna live
some normal, apple-pie life?

7
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:18,776
Not normal. Safe.
I'm a vessel?

8
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:21,628
- You're the vessel. Michael's vessel.
- The answer's no.

9
00:00:21,753 --> 00:00:23,014
Where's cass?

10
00:00:23,139 --> 00:00:24,857
The archangel
smote the crap out of him.

11
00:00:24,982 --> 00:00:26,640
- How are you...
- alive?

12
00:00:26,765 --> 00:00:28,385
That's a good question.

13
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,622
I just wish i could save people,
like i used to.

14
00:00:30,747 --> 00:00:33,024
What, when you were
all hopped up on demon blood?

15
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,354
Your plan to kill lucifer.
It's foolish. It can't be done.

16
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,930
I have the solution.
I'm gonna find god.

17
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:41,082
Try new mexico.
I hear he's on a tortilla.

18
00:00:41,387 --> 00:00:43,334
I killed two angels this week.

19
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,070
I rebelled. And i did it...
all of it... for you.

20
00:00:46,195 --> 00:00:48,806
- And you failed.
- I'm in no shape to be hunting.

21
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:51,442
Maybe it's best
we just go our separate ways.

22
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:53,601
I think you're right.

23
00:01:14,596 --> 00:01:16,325
Hey, baby.

24
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:19,078
I missed you.

25
00:01:23,538 --> 00:01:25,273
I'm dreaming.

26
00:01:26,488 --> 00:01:28,445
Or you're not.

27
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,756
What's the difference?
I'm here.

28
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:38,489
I miss you so much.

29
00:01:38,614 --> 00:01:40,178
I know.

30
00:01:42,285 --> 00:01:43,919
I miss you, too.

31
00:01:46,555 --> 00:01:48,690
What are you doing, sam?

32
00:01:50,893 --> 00:01:52,488
What do you mean?

33
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,305
Running away.

34
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,060
Haven't we been
down this road before?

35
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,981
- It's different now.
- Really?

36
00:02:01,593 --> 00:02:04,563
Last time, i wanted to be normal.

37
00:02:05,107 --> 00:02:08,750
This time...
i know i'm a freak.

38
00:02:09,507 --> 00:02:12,356
Which is all
a big ball of semantics.

39
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:14,625
- You know that.
- No.

40
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,737
Even at stanford, you knew.

41
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:19,263
You knew there was
something dark inside of you.

42
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:23,158
Deep down, maybe, but... you knew.

43
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:26,425
Baby, that's what got me killed.

44
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,164
No.

45
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:31,624
I was dead from the moment
we said hello.

46
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:34,378
Don't you get it?

47
00:02:34,503 --> 00:02:36,637
You can't run from yourself.

48
00:02:37,523 --> 00:02:39,117
Why are you running now?

49
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,552
Why are you here, jess?

50
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:44,455
Would you believe i'm actually
trying to protect you?

51
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,657
- From what?
- You.

52
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:49,560
Sooner or later, the past
is gonna catch up to you,

53
00:02:49,685 --> 00:02:51,295
like it always does.

54
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,647
You know what happens then?

55
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,756
People die.

56
00:02:57,634 --> 00:03:00,180
Baby, the people closest to you die.

57
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,474
Don't worry, because
i won't make that mistake again.

58
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,096
Same song, different verse.

59
00:03:07,703 --> 00:03:10,372
Things are never
gonna change with you.

60
00:03:11,374 --> 00:03:12,566
Ever.

One week earlier

64
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,918
Hi, i'm detective bill buckner.

65
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:23,020
Yes? How can i help you, detective?

66
00:04:23,145 --> 00:04:26,381
I'm here about those patients...
the exsanguinated ones.

67
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,022
Eat it, twilight.

68
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:57,391
God!

69
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,675
Don't do that.

70
00:06:01,964 --> 00:06:03,364
Hello, dean.

71
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:10,911
We've talked about this.

72
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,259
Personal space?

73
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,790
My apologies.

74
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,576
How'd you find me?

75
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:22,139
I thought i was
flying below the angel radar.

76
00:06:22,264 --> 00:06:23,722
You are.

77
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:26,844
Bobby told me where you were.

78
00:06:29,076 --> 00:06:30,771
Where's sam?

79
00:06:34,472 --> 00:06:37,845
Me and sam are taking
separate vacations for a while.

80
00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:42,289
So...
did you find god yet?

81
00:06:42,414 --> 00:06:44,695
More importantly, can i have
my damn necklace back, please?

82
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,197
No, i haven't found him.

83
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,115
That's why i'm here.
I need your help.

84
00:06:48,457 --> 00:06:51,602
With what...
a god hunt? I'm not interested.

85
00:06:51,727 --> 00:06:53,525
It's not god.
It's someone else.

86
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,477
Who?

87
00:06:56,932 --> 00:06:58,909
It's an archangel.

88
00:06:59,034 --> 00:07:00,964
The one who killed me.

89
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,922
- Excuse me?
- His name is raphael.

90
00:07:05,474 --> 00:07:07,968
You were wasted by
a teenage mutant ninja angel?

91
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,855
I've heard whispers
that he's walking the earth.

92
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,557
This is a rare opportunity.

93
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:16,426
- For what... revenge?
- Information.

94
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:19,011
So, what...
you think if you find this dude,

95
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:21,440
he's just gonna spill god's address?

96
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,228
Because we are gonna trap him
and interrogate him.

97
00:07:27,996 --> 00:07:30,565
You're serious about this.

98
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,215
So, what...
i'm thelma and you're louise,

99
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,099
and we're just gonna hold hands
and sail off this cliff together?

100
00:07:47,452 --> 00:07:50,062
Give me one good reason
why i should do this.

101
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,468
Because you're michael's vessel,

102
00:07:52,593 --> 00:07:54,865
and no angel will dare harm you.

103
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,158
I'm your bullet shield?

104
00:07:58,015 --> 00:08:00,521
I need your help...

105
00:08:01,838 --> 00:08:05,673
because you are the only one
who will help me.

106
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,567
Please.

107
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:18,008
All right. Fine.

108
00:08:18,793 --> 00:08:21,476
- Where is he?
- Maine.

109
00:08:21,731 --> 00:08:23,277
Let's go.

110
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:24,695
What?

111
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,570
Last time you zapped me someplace,
i didn't poop for a week.

112
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,510
We're driving.

113
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:33,804
Hey, keith, you play?

114
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,164
That depends...
what are we playing for?

115
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:39,963
World peace.

116
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:42,713
Is that all?

117
00:08:42,838 --> 00:08:44,982
Can i ask you something?

118
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,377
Shoot.

119
00:08:46,712 --> 00:08:50,187
You finish that,
crossword puzzle in the kitchen?

120
00:08:50,312 --> 00:08:52,781
I guess.
Why?

121
00:08:52,906 --> 00:08:56,034
The new york times
saturday crossword?

122
00:08:57,321 --> 00:08:58,561
Was it?

123
00:09:00,155 --> 00:09:03,188
You blow into town last week.
You don't talk to anybody.

124
00:09:03,313 --> 00:09:05,747
You're obviously
highly educated. You're like this...

125
00:09:05,872 --> 00:09:08,672
riddle wrapped inside an enigma
wrapped inside a taco?

126
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:11,568
Here's what we play for.

127
00:09:12,388 --> 00:09:15,596
When i win, you buy me dinner
and tell me your life story.

128
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:19,367
Sounds fair.

129
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,028
Very misterioso.

130
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,996
Freak hail, lightning strikes... 

131
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:35,699
now fire consuming the town
of hawley tonight, john.

132
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:38,236
Locals say what started
as a torrential hailstorm

133
00:09:38,361 --> 00:09:41,639
late this afternoon suddenly turned to
massive lightning strikes.

134
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:44,408
That triggered the fire now
consuming more than 20 acres

135
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:46,533
here along the route 17 corridor.

136
00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:48,971
County officials are advising
all hawley residents

137
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:52,340
to prepare for what could
become mandatory evacuations.

138
00:09:53,036 --> 00:09:54,409
Damn.

139
00:09:55,258 --> 00:09:58,203
Is it me, or does it seem
like the end of the world?

140
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:04,214
We're here why?

141
00:10:05,754 --> 00:10:08,518
A deputy sheriff
laid eyes on the archangel.

142
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,259
And he still has eyes?

143
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,616
All right, what's the plan?

144
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:15,206
We...

145
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:18,075
tell the officer that he
witnessed an angel of the lord.

146
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,377
Then the officer will tell us
where the angel is.

147
00:10:21,502 --> 00:10:24,781
Are you serious? You're gonna walk
in there and tell him the truth?

148
00:10:24,906 --> 00:10:26,799
- Why not?
- Because...

149
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:30,833
and when humans want
something we're humans.

150
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,834
Really, really bad...

151
00:10:34,616 --> 00:10:35,926
we lie.

152
00:10:36,918 --> 00:10:38,128
Why?

153
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:41,856
Because... that's how
you become president.

154
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:46,060
Deputy framingham?

155
00:10:46,718 --> 00:10:47,818
Hi.

156
00:10:48,063 --> 00:10:49,997
Alonzo mosely, fbi.

157
00:10:50,122 --> 00:10:52,163
This is my partner, eddie moscone.

158
00:10:53,034 --> 00:10:55,069
Also fbi.

159
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,356
He's new.

160
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,416
Mind if we ask you a few questions?

161
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,287
Yeah. Sure.
Talk here, though.

162
00:11:10,412 --> 00:11:12,663
Hearing's all blown to hell
in this one.

163
00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:14,565
That happen recently?

164
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,157
Yeah...
the gas-station thing.

165
00:11:17,705 --> 00:11:19,688
That's why you're here, isn't it?

166
00:11:20,662 --> 00:11:22,129
Yes, it is.

167
00:11:23,485 --> 00:11:26,567
Do you mind just, uh, running us
through what happened?

168
00:11:27,305 --> 00:11:29,046
Call came in...

169
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:31,338
disturbance out at
the pump'n'go on route 4.

170
00:11:31,463 --> 00:11:33,126
What kind of disturbance?

171
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:35,786
Would not have believed my eyes
if i hadn't seen it myself.

172
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:38,355
We're talking a riot...
full-scale.

173
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,491
- How many?
- 30, 40.

174
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,360
In all-out,
kill-or-be-killed combat.

175
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,238
Any idea what set them off?

176
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,998
It's angels and demons, probably.

177
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:50,382
They're skirmishing
all over the globe.

178
00:11:50,507 --> 00:11:52,263
Come again? What did he say?

179
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:54,371
- Demons.
- Nothing.

180
00:11:55,401 --> 00:11:58,629
Demons, you know...
drink, adultery.

181
00:11:58,754 --> 00:12:01,345
We all have our demons, walt. Right?

182
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:04,256
I guess.

183
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:07,184
Anyway...
what happened next?

184
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,350
Freakin' explosion, that's what.

185
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:12,871
They said it was one
of those underground gas tanks,

186
00:12:13,337 --> 00:12:15,438
- but... i don't think so.
- Why not?

187
00:12:15,563 --> 00:12:18,153
It wasn't your usual fireball.
It was...

188
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:20,030
pure white.

189
00:12:22,424 --> 00:12:25,168
Gas station was leveled.

190
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,464
Everyone was...

191
00:12:27,763 --> 00:12:30,012
it was just horrible.

192
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:33,568
Then i see this one guy,
kneeling there,

193
00:12:34,349 --> 00:12:36,246
real focused-like.

194
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:38,849
- Not a damn scratch on him.
- You know him?

195
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:42,791
- Donnie finnerman, mechanic there.
- And let me guess... he just...

196
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,284
vanished into thin air?

197
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:47,827
No, kolchak.

198
00:12:47,952 --> 00:12:49,760
He's down at st. Pete's.

199
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:52,487
St. Pete's.

200
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,956
Thank you.

201
00:12:57,893 --> 00:13:00,437
I take it
that's not raphael anymore.

202
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:02,363
Just an empty vessel.

203
00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:05,776
Is this what i'm looking at
when michael jumps my bones?

204
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:07,110
No, not at all.

205
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,446
Michael is much more powerful.

206
00:13:09,571 --> 00:13:11,540
It'll be far worse for you.

207
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:34,638
Hey, bobby.
How you doin'?

208
00:13:34,763 --> 00:13:37,641
I ain't runnin'
any marathons, but...

209
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:40,310
i'll live. Where are you?

210
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,999
Garber, oklahoma.

211
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:45,482
I found a town up the road
showing some revelation omens.

212
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:47,793
- What omens?
- All right, listen to this.

213
00:13:47,918 --> 00:13:51,254
"And upon his rising, there shall
be hail and fire mixed with blood."

214
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:53,553
- Ain't that delightful.
- Yeah.

215
00:13:53,678 --> 00:13:55,325
We already got hailstorms and fires.

216
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,416
I'm guessing blood
can't be too far behind.

217
00:14:00,426 --> 00:14:02,823
- What?
- There a reason you're calling?

218
00:14:05,994 --> 00:14:08,521
- Dean didn't tell you?
- He told me.

219
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:10,941
Yeah...
so i just thought

220
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,877
you might want to find out
who's in the area, put a man on this.

221
00:14:14,002 --> 00:14:16,313
Okay, let me see if i can think

222
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,506
of the best hunter who might be
in the immediate vicinity.

223
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,113
That'd be you.

224
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,189
I can't, bobby.
I'm sitting this one out. I got to go.

225
00:14:26,314 --> 00:14:28,448
- I'm so sorry.
- Hold on. Sam.

226
00:14:55,225 --> 00:14:56,869
Where have you been?

227
00:14:56,994 --> 00:14:58,603
Jerusalem.

228
00:14:58,728 --> 00:15:00,417
How was it?

229
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:01,733
Arid.

230
00:15:03,123 --> 00:15:04,683
What is that?

231
00:15:04,808 --> 00:15:06,378
It's oil. It's very special

232
00:15:06,503 --> 00:15:08,342
and very rare.

233
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:13,261
Okay, are we gonna... trap
raphael with a nice vinaigrette?

234
00:15:13,607 --> 00:15:14,707
No.

235
00:15:14,884 --> 00:15:17,384
So, this ritual of yours,
when's it got to go down?

236
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:18,856
Sunrise.

237
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:21,691
Tell me something... you keep
saying we're gonna trap this guy,

238
00:15:21,816 --> 00:15:24,386
but isn't that kind of like trapping
a hurricane with a butterfly net?

239
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,226
No. It's harder.

240
00:15:26,734 --> 00:15:28,635
Do we have any chance
of surviving this?

241
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,438
You do.

242
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,691
So, odds are,
you're a dead man tomorrow?

243
00:15:34,816 --> 00:15:36,091
Yes.

244
00:15:39,032 --> 00:15:41,671
Last night on earth.
What,...

245
00:15:41,796 --> 00:15:43,973
what are your plans?

246
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:48,263
I just thought i'd sit here quietly.

247
00:15:50,627 --> 00:15:52,304
Dude. Come on.
Anything?

248
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:54,579
Booze, women?

249
00:15:58,594 --> 00:16:00,825
You have been
with a woman before, right?

250
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,895
Or an angel, at least?

251
00:16:06,387 --> 00:16:08,268
You mean to tell me
you've never been up there

252
00:16:08,393 --> 00:16:09,930
doing a little cloud-seeding?

253
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:11,768
I've never had occasion, okay?

254
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:19,000
All right.

255
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:22,249
Let me tell you something.

256
00:16:22,374 --> 00:16:24,640
There are two things
that i know for certain. One,

257
00:16:24,765 --> 00:16:27,034
bert and ernie are gay.

258
00:16:27,371 --> 00:16:30,827
Two, you are not gonna die a virgin.

259
00:16:30,952 --> 00:16:33,013
Not on my watch.

260
00:16:33,478 --> 00:16:34,848
Let's go.

261
00:16:40,237 --> 00:16:41,294
Hey, Sam.

262
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:43,944
Sam!

263
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,172
Sam?
What happened to Keith?

264
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:51,648
What?

265
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:53,750
He called you Sam.

266
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,876
- Sam's my middle name.
- "Keith Sam"?

267
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,833
Man, i'm sorry.

268
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,409
Actually, it's Samuel,

269
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:03,676
So it's not quite
as dumb as it sounds.

270
00:17:05,438 --> 00:17:08,419
- Are you guys friends?
- Huntin' buddies with his dad.

271
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:11,747
But Samuel here is quite
the hunter himself.

272
00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:15,221
You kill deer and things?

273
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:17,115
Yeah, "and things."

274
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,204
Why don't I get you guys some drinks?

275
00:17:20,892 --> 00:17:23,542
Sorry.
Didn't mean to bust you back there.

276
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,414
No, it's all right.

277
00:17:26,006 --> 00:17:27,330
So, what's up?

278
00:17:27,455 --> 00:17:28,421
Bobby called.

279
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,339
And?

280
00:17:30,178 --> 00:17:31,295
You were right...

281
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,093
Major demon block party going on.

282
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,674
- But why? What are they up to?
- Don't know yet.

283
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:37,811
Bobby told us you were off limits.

284
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:39,874
That true?

285
00:17:42,724 --> 00:17:43,887
Yeah, that's right.

286
00:17:44,012 --> 00:17:45,593
That's fine in theory and all,

287
00:17:45,718 --> 00:17:47,796
but we could really use
all hands on deck here.

288
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:48,989
I know you could.

289
00:17:50,873 --> 00:17:52,362
But i can't.
I'm sorry.

290
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,528
Why not?

291
00:17:55,718 --> 00:17:56,955
It's personal.

292
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,337
Sam, no offense,
but what baggage is so heavy,

293
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:02,955
it can't be stowed away for
the freakin' apocalypse?

294
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,001
- Like i said...
- Yeah.

295
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,375
You're sorry.

296
00:18:09,011 --> 00:18:10,511
Heard you the first time.

297
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:16,104
Suit yourself.

298
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,823
More for us, then, right?

299
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:19,739
Good luck.

300
00:18:21,162 --> 00:18:23,385
But... beers are on you
when we get back.

301
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,753
Yeah, you bet.

302
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:31,135
So, your parents were drunk
when they named you

303
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,793
and you shoot bambi?

304
00:18:32,918 --> 00:18:34,348
It's a... long story.

305
00:18:34,473 --> 00:18:35,508
That is it.

306
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:39,176
Enough with the kung-fu,
wandering-the-earth thing.

307
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:41,358
I'm gonna buy you dinner,
and we're gonna talk.

308
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:44,270
Lindsey, i can't.

309
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,250
The only way to avoid
bloodshed is to say yes.

310
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,313
Relax.

311
00:19:03,024 --> 00:19:04,809
This is a den of iniquity.

312
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:06,178
I should not be here.

313
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,243
Dude, you full-on
rebelled against heaven.

314
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:11,959
Iniquity is
one of the perks.

315
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:14,001
Showtime.

316
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,751
Hi.
What's your name?

317
00:19:23,268 --> 00:19:23,953
Cass!

318
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,889
His name is cass.
What's your name?

319
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:26,998
Chastity.

320
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:28,525
Chastity?

321
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,290
Is that kismet or what, buddy?

322
00:19:33,068 --> 00:19:35,936
He likes you and you like him, so...

323
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:37,491
Dayenu.

324
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:40,787
Come on, baby.

325
00:19:44,702 --> 00:19:45,655
Listen.

326
00:19:47,078 --> 00:19:48,206
Take this.

327
00:19:48,775 --> 00:19:50,691
If she asks for a credit card, no.

328
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:54,012
Just stick to the basics, okay?
Do not order off the menu.

329
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,694
Go get her, tiger.

330
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:59,487
Don't make me push you.

331
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,159
Cheers to you.

332
00:20:14,105 --> 00:20:16,361
Get out of my face!
Leave me alone!

333
00:20:16,486 --> 00:20:18,682
Bastard!
Screw you, jerk!

334
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,003
I'll kill you!

335
00:20:21,441 --> 00:20:23,096
Screw you, too!
God!

336
00:20:26,213 --> 00:20:27,527
What the hell did you do?

337
00:20:27,652 --> 00:20:28,718
I don't know.

338
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:31,688
I just looked at her in the eyes
and told her it wasn't her fault

339
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,465
that her father, Gene, ran off.

340
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,468
It was because
he hated his job at the post office.

341
00:20:37,114 --> 00:20:38,143
No, man.

342
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:39,687
What?

343
00:20:39,812 --> 00:20:42,238
This whole industry runs
on absent fathers.

344
00:20:42,363 --> 00:20:43,913
It's the natural order.

345
00:20:46,109 --> 00:20:47,719
We should go.
Come on.

346
00:20:57,805 --> 00:20:59,257
What's so funny?

347
00:21:01,913 --> 00:21:02,887
Nothing.

348
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,294
It's been a long time
since i've laughed that hard.

349
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:12,287
It's been more than a long time.

350
00:21:13,076 --> 00:21:14,017
Years.

351
00:21:18,287 --> 00:21:19,306
So...

352
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,174
you gonna tell me
who those guys back there really were?

353
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:23,860
And don't say "hunting buddies".

354
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:28,973
We used to be
in the Same business together.

355
00:21:29,903 --> 00:21:31,173
What business?

356
00:21:33,254 --> 00:21:34,677
How's your salad?

357
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,981
Witness protection, right?
You're mafia?

358
00:21:42,684 --> 00:21:43,927
I'm not mafia.

359
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,662
Okay. I get it.

360
00:21:46,188 --> 00:21:47,764
I don't mean to pry. My bad.

361
00:21:54,953 --> 00:21:56,880
I used to be in business
with my brother.

362
00:21:57,702 --> 00:22:01,014
Truth is, I was pretty good
at the job.

363
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:05,573
But...
i made some mistakes.

364
00:22:06,346 --> 00:22:08,471
I did some stuff
I'm not so proud of.

365
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,408
And people got hurt.

366
00:22:12,193 --> 00:22:13,559
A lot of people.

367
00:22:18,865 --> 00:22:20,190
What was your poison?

368
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:23,310
- Sorry?
- Come on.

369
00:22:24,001 --> 00:22:26,052
You were hooked on something.
I know the look.

370
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:35,090
Three years sober.

371
00:22:36,295 --> 00:22:37,685
You work in a bar.

372
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:38,648
So do you.

373
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,610
Look, Keith...

374
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,155
I don't know you,

375
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,627
and I'm the last person
to be giving advice,

376
00:22:47,752 --> 00:22:49,622
but I do know that...

377
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:53,413
No one has ever
done anything so bad,

378
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,985
they can't be forgiven.

379
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,669
That they can't change.

380
00:23:20,906 --> 00:23:22,335
When the oil burns,

381
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,055
no angel can touch
or pass through the flames,

382
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,863
or he dies.

383
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,992
So we trap him in a steel cage
of holy fire.

384
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,670
But, one question...

385
00:23:33,031 --> 00:23:34,706
How the hell
do we get him here?

386
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:38,291
There's almost an open phone line...

387
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:42,079
Between a vessel and his angel.

388
00:23:43,513 --> 00:23:45,703
One just has to know how to dial.

389
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:06,990
I'm here, Raphael.

390
00:24:08,873 --> 00:24:11,851
Come and get me,
you little bastard.

391
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,991
Just out of curiosity, what is
the average customer wait time

392
00:24:23,116 --> 00:24:25,463
to speak to an archangel?

393
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:27,966
Be ready.

394
00:24:48,997 --> 00:24:51,657
That's a day I'll never get back.

395
00:25:17,136 --> 00:25:19,394
I thought you were supposed
to be impressive.

396
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,431
All you do is black out the room?

397
00:25:21,556 --> 00:25:23,396
And the eastern seaboard.

398
00:25:26,646 --> 00:25:28,890
It is a testament
to my unending mercy

399
00:25:29,015 --> 00:25:31,629
that I don't smite you here and now.

400
00:25:31,754 --> 00:25:33,818
Or maybe you're full of crap.

401
00:25:36,644 --> 00:25:39,495
Maybe you're afraid that god
will bring Cass back to life again

402
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,831
and smite you,
you candy-ass skirt.

403
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,626
- By the way... Hi, I'm Dean.
- I know who you are.

404
00:25:47,697 --> 00:25:51,299
And now, thanks to him,
I know where you are.

405
00:25:51,726 --> 00:25:53,467
You won't kill him.

406
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,537
- You wouldn't dare.
- But I will take him to Michael.

407
00:25:56,767 --> 00:25:59,351
That... sounds terrifying.

408
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:00,741
It does.

409
00:26:01,146 --> 00:26:03,697
But I hate to tell you...

410
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:07,135
I'm not going anywhere with you.

411
00:26:08,854 --> 00:26:11,821
Surely you remember Zachariah
giving you stomach cancer.

412
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:18,918
That was hilarious.

413
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:20,561
Yes, well...

414
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:23,812
He doesn't have anything
close to my imagination.

415
00:26:33,922 --> 00:26:35,718
I bet you didn't imagine one thing.

416
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:36,824
What?

417
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,097
We knew you were coming,
you stupid son of a bitch.

418
00:26:57,675 --> 00:26:59,825
Don't look at me.
It was his idea.

419
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:08,307
Where is he?

420
00:27:08,767 --> 00:27:09,621
God?

421
00:27:11,472 --> 00:27:12,851
Didn't you hear?

422
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,258
He's dead, Castiel.

423
00:27:17,523 --> 00:27:18,481
Dead.

424
00:27:25,335 --> 00:27:26,627
Bar's closed.

425
00:27:32,795 --> 00:27:34,821
Is there something
you want to tell me, Sam?

426
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:35,992
What?

427
00:27:38,626 --> 00:27:40,157
You sure about that?

428
00:27:41,516 --> 00:27:42,469
I don't...

429
00:27:44,352 --> 00:27:45,184
Geez.

430
00:27:46,203 --> 00:27:47,527
Are you okay?

431
00:27:48,797 --> 00:27:50,462
Where are Reggie and Steve?

432
00:27:50,692 --> 00:27:52,338
Steve's good.
He's...

433
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,049
His guts are laying roadside
outside the hawley five-and-dime.

434
00:28:00,386 --> 00:28:02,513
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry don't cut it, Sam.

435
00:28:03,536 --> 00:28:05,970
- What do you want me to say?
- The truth.

436
00:28:08,485 --> 00:28:09,317
Fine.

437
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,022
Let me give you some
of my own, then.

438
00:28:13,106 --> 00:28:15,723
We go into town,
we capture ourselves a demon,

439
00:28:15,848 --> 00:28:17,820
and we get jumped by 10 more.

440
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:19,523
Steve bought it.

441
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,075
I'm sorry.

442
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:26,329
Saying it twice
don't make it so, Sam.

443
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,817
But you see, this demon, he...

444
00:28:30,135 --> 00:28:31,709
He told us things.

445
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:34,142
Crazy things.
Things about you, Sam.

446
00:28:34,267 --> 00:28:35,456
Demons lie.

447
00:28:38,031 --> 00:28:40,374
I'm gonna ask you one last time.

448
00:28:41,491 --> 00:28:42,717
The truth.

449
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,130
Now!

450
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,949
Lindsey!

451
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,800
What's going on?

452
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,031
There's no other explanation.

453
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:03,741
He's gone for good.

454
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,738
- You're lying.
- Am I?

455
00:29:05,863 --> 00:29:08,621
Do you remember the 20th century?

456
00:29:09,406 --> 00:29:11,672
Think the 21st is going any better?

457
00:29:12,231 --> 00:29:14,935
You think god would have let
any of that happen

458
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,751
if he were alive?

459
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,083
Then who invented
the chinese basket trick?

460
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:24,536
Careful.

461
00:29:24,661 --> 00:29:27,098
That's my father
you're talking about, boy.

462
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,953
Who would be so proud

463
00:29:29,078 --> 00:29:31,435
to know that his sons started
the friggin' apocalypse.

464
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,548
Who ran off and disappeared.

465
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:38,984
Who left no instructions
and a world to run.

466
00:29:42,067 --> 00:29:43,739
So daddy ran away and disappeared?

467
00:29:44,968 --> 00:29:47,281
He didn't happen to work
for the post office, did he?

468
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,633
This is funny to you?

469
00:29:49,758 --> 00:29:51,580
You're living in a godless universe.

470
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:53,508
And?

471
00:29:53,949 --> 00:29:55,350
What you and the other kids

472
00:29:55,475 --> 00:29:57,935
just decide to throw
an apocalypse while he's gone?

473
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,880
We're tired.

474
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,883
We just want it to be over.

475
00:30:04,204 --> 00:30:05,719
We just want...

476
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:08,806
... paradise.

477
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,060
So, what... god dies
and makes you the boss,

478
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,304
and you think you can do
whatever you want?

479
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:18,166
Yes.

480
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:20,568
And whatever we want, we get.

481
00:30:24,106 --> 00:30:25,749
Let's just take it easy.

482
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,124
Put the knife down.

483
00:30:45,298 --> 00:30:46,427
It's true.

484
00:30:47,477 --> 00:30:49,765
What the demon said...
it's all true.

485
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,747
- Keep going.
- Why?

486
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,987
Are you gonna hate me any less?

487
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:57,785
Am i gonna hate myself any less?

488
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:01,555
- What do you want?
- I want to hear you say it.

489
00:31:09,357 --> 00:31:10,826
I did it.

490
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,043
I started
the apocalypse.

491
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:18,083
If god is dead,
why have i returned?

492
00:31:18,955 --> 00:31:20,461
Who brought me back?

493
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:24,890
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe Lucifer raised you?

494
00:31:26,681 --> 00:31:28,028
- No.
- Think about it.

495
00:31:28,806 --> 00:31:31,263
He needs all the rebellious
angels he can find.

496
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:35,643
You know it adds up.

497
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:40,606
Let's go.

498
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:41,786
Castiel.

499
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,516
I'm warning you.

500
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:45,432
Do not leave me here.

501
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:49,862
I will find you.

502
00:31:52,007 --> 00:31:53,174
Maybe one day.

503
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,455
But today, you're my little bitch.

504
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,759
What he said.

505
00:32:13,202 --> 00:32:14,406
What is that?

506
00:32:15,008 --> 00:32:16,392
What do you think it is?

507
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:19,228
It's go juice,
Sammy boy.

508
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,403
- Get that away from me.
- Away from you?

509
00:32:23,571 --> 00:32:24,984
This is for you.

510
00:32:25,817 --> 00:32:28,193
Hell, if that demon
wasn't right as rain.

511
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:30,573
Down the hatch, son.

512
00:32:31,084 --> 00:32:32,321
You're insane.

513
00:32:32,446 --> 00:32:34,248
Look, here's what's gonna happen.

514
00:32:34,373 --> 00:32:37,121
You're gonna drink this, hulk out,

515
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:39,748
And you're gonna waste
every one of those demon scum

516
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,455
that killed my best friend.

517
00:32:44,902 --> 00:32:46,160
Or she dies.

518
00:32:47,322 --> 00:32:48,668
You wouldn't do that.

519
00:32:48,793 --> 00:32:51,343
It's funny how watching
your best friend die changes that.

520
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:54,613
Come on.
You know you want it, Sam.

521
00:32:54,738 --> 00:32:56,404
Just reach out and take it.

522
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:41,337
There.
Was that really so bad?

523
00:34:20,855 --> 00:34:21,955
Go.

524
00:34:23,278 --> 00:34:25,011
Don't think we won't be back.

525
00:34:25,136 --> 00:34:27,193
Don't think i won't be here.

526
00:34:45,197 --> 00:34:46,993
You okay?

527
00:34:51,352 --> 00:34:55,292
I'll be the first to tell you That this
little crusade of yours is not expected.

528
00:34:56,924 --> 00:34:59,788
I do know a little something
about missing fathers.

529
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:01,900
What do you mean?

530
00:35:02,025 --> 00:35:04,360
There were times
when i was looking for my dad When...

531
00:35:05,325 --> 00:35:07,797
all logic said that he was dead.

532
00:35:09,999 --> 00:35:12,678
But i knew, in my heart...

533
00:35:12,803 --> 00:35:14,706
That he was still alive.

534
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,817
Who cares what some
ninja turtle says, cass?

535
00:35:18,942 --> 00:35:20,743
What do you believe?

536
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:25,931
I believe he's out there.

537
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:28,567
Good. Then go find him.

538
00:35:33,523 --> 00:35:36,274
- What about you?
- What about me?

539
00:35:37,974 --> 00:35:40,151
I don't know.

540
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,107
Honestly?

541
00:35:42,232 --> 00:35:43,515
I'm good.

542
00:35:44,134 --> 00:35:46,836
I can't believe
i'm saying that, but i am.

543
00:35:47,887 --> 00:35:49,771
I'm really good.

544
00:35:49,973 --> 00:35:52,441
Even without your brother?

545
00:35:54,678 --> 00:35:56,879
Especially without my brother.

546
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:01,240
I spent so much time Worrying about
the son of a bitch.

547
00:36:01,985 --> 00:36:05,096
I've had more fun
with you in the past 24 hours

548
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:07,599
Than i've had with sam in years.

549
00:36:07,724 --> 00:36:09,968
And you're not that much fun.

550
00:36:13,363 --> 00:36:16,562
It's funny. You know,
i've been so chained to my family.

551
00:36:17,501 --> 00:36:19,865
But now that i'm alone...

552
00:36:20,858 --> 00:36:22,956
Hell, i'm happy.

553
00:36:55,486 --> 00:36:57,671
This is your life now?

554
00:37:00,026 --> 00:37:03,999
You can just live forever With
your head buried in the sand?

555
00:37:10,801 --> 00:37:13,219
I love you, jess.

556
00:37:18,673 --> 00:37:21,762
God knows how much i miss you, too.

557
00:37:23,931 --> 00:37:25,951
But you're wrong.

558
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,385
People can change.

559
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,937
There is reason for hope.

560
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,961
No, sam.

561
00:37:36,578 --> 00:37:38,580
There isn't.

562
00:37:46,028 --> 00:37:48,540
How can you be so sure?

563
00:37:49,155 --> 00:37:51,314
Because you freed me.

564
00:37:57,629 --> 00:37:59,330
That's right.

565
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,234
You know who i am.

566
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:08,033
- Lucifer.
- You are a hard one to find, sam.

567
00:38:09,071 --> 00:38:11,288
Harder than most humans.

568
00:38:12,596 --> 00:38:15,346
I don't suppose
you'll tell me where you are?

569
00:38:15,471 --> 00:38:18,349
- What do you want with me?
- Thanks to you,

570
00:38:18,947 --> 00:38:20,838
i walk the earth.

571
00:38:21,886 --> 00:38:24,027
I want to give you a gift.

572
00:38:24,152 --> 00:38:27,437
- I want to give you everything.
- I don't want anything from you.

573
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:34,072
I'm so sorry, sam.
I really am.

574
00:38:34,197 --> 00:38:37,853
But nick here
is just an improvisation.

575
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,479
Plan "b."

576
00:38:40,604 --> 00:38:43,528
He can barely contain me without
spontaneously combusting.

577
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,743
What are you talking about?

578
00:38:46,512 --> 00:38:49,242
Why do you think
you were in that chapel?

579
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,289
You're the one, sam.

580
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:57,275
You're my vessel.

581
00:38:57,561 --> 00:39:00,057
My true vessel.

582
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:12,083
- That'll never happen.
- I'm sorry, but it will.

583
00:39:13,072 --> 00:39:14,979
I will find you.

584
00:39:15,104 --> 00:39:17,141
And when i do...

585
00:39:17,266 --> 00:39:19,366
you will let me in.

586
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,608
I'm sure of it.

587
00:39:21,847 --> 00:39:24,082
You need my consent?

588
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:27,062
Of course.
I'm an angel.

589
00:39:29,613 --> 00:39:32,244
I will kill myself
before letting you in.

590
00:39:32,524 --> 00:39:34,715
And i'll just bring you back.

591
00:39:41,272 --> 00:39:43,704
My heart breaks for you.

592
00:39:44,745 --> 00:39:47,383
The weight on your shoulders.

593
00:39:47,666 --> 00:39:49,219
What you've done.

594
00:39:49,575 --> 00:39:52,209
What you still have to do.

595
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:55,113
It is more than anyone could bear.

596
00:39:55,528 --> 00:39:57,864
If there was some other way...

597
00:39:58,651 --> 00:40:00,436
But there isn't.

598
00:40:03,222 --> 00:40:05,386
I will never lie to you.

599
00:40:05,758 --> 00:40:07,857
I will never trick you.

600
00:40:07,982 --> 00:40:10,321
But you will say yes to me.

601
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,826
- You're wrong.
- I'm not.

602
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:17,683
I think i know you
better than you know yourself.

603
00:40:22,158 --> 00:40:23,675
Why me?

604
00:40:24,135 --> 00:40:26,547
Because it had to be you, sam.

605
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:31,527
It always had to be you.
