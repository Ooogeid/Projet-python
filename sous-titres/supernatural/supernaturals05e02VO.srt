1
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:11,486
You did it.

2
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,696
- What did I do?
- You opened the door.

3
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:15,367
Lilith was the final seal.

4
00:00:15,492 --> 00:00:17,662
I killed her,
and I set Lucifer free.

5
00:00:32,209 --> 00:00:34,491
Jonesing for another hit
of bitch blood or what?

6
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,785
You're the michael sword.

7
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,275
- What do you mean, I'm the sword?
- You're michael's weapon.

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,339
- I'm a vessel?
- You're the vessel.

9
00:00:41,464 --> 00:00:43,542
Rufus turner. He's a hunter.

10
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:46,482
I'm what you've got to look
forward to if you survive.

11
00:00:50,054 --> 00:00:51,571
Need some help here!

12
00:00:54,275 --> 00:00:56,722
- What the hell was that?
- An enochian sigil.

13
00:00:56,891 --> 00:01:00,258
It'll hide you from every angel
in creation, including Lucifer.

14
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:04,730
It was my fault.
But Jo did good out there.

15
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,917
- You're angry. I understand.
- Angry?

16
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:08,652
"Angry" doesn't begin to touch it!

17
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,636
Is this about me hunting
or something else?

18
00:01:15,763 --> 00:01:17,416
You chose a demon

19
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:20,746
over your own brother.
I just don't think I can trust you.

20
00:01:39,246 --> 00:01:41,610
What's it been...
like, three days now?

21
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:43,936
We got to cheer him up.

22
00:01:44,264 --> 00:01:46,438
Maybe I'll give him a back rub.

23
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:48,733
What, then?

24
00:01:51,226 --> 00:01:52,497
Look...

25
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,135
We might have to wrap
our heads around the idea

26
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,568
That Bobby might not just
bounce back this time.

27
00:02:01,574 --> 00:02:03,515
What's in the envelope?

28
00:02:04,737 --> 00:02:06,233
Went to radiology.

29
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:07,958
Got some glamour shots.

30
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,873
Let's just say
the doctors are baffled.

31
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,173
Holy crap.

32
00:02:13,406 --> 00:02:15,333
Yeah, well,
Cass carved you one, too.

33
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,339
Hello?

34
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:24,018
Castiel?

35
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,532
Speak of the devil.

36
00:02:26,657 --> 00:02:28,981
St. Martin's hospital.
Why? What are you...

37
00:02:33,022 --> 00:02:35,129
blue team to I.C.U., please.

38
00:02:35,254 --> 00:02:37,491
Blue team to I.C.U.

39
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,238
Cellphone, Cass? Really?

40
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:44,539
Since when do angels need to
reach out and touch someone?

41
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,908
You're hidden from
angels now... all angels.

42
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,409
- I won't be able to simply...
- Enough foreplay.

43
00:02:49,534 --> 00:02:52,337
Get over here and lay
your damn hands on.

44
00:02:54,356 --> 00:02:57,116
Get healing... now.

45
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:58,810
I can't.

46
00:03:04,328 --> 00:03:07,876
- Say again?
- I'm cut off from heaven

47
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,124
and much of heaven's power.

48
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:13,234
Certain things, I can do.
Certain things, I can't.

49
00:03:13,572 --> 00:03:16,495
You're telling me you
lost your mojo just in time

50
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,941
To get me stuck in this
trap the rest of my life?!

51
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,676
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,832
Shove it up your ass.

53
00:03:26,468 --> 00:03:28,149
At least he's talking now.

54
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:29,908
I heard that.

55
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,778
I don't have much time.
We need to talk.

56
00:03:33,437 --> 00:03:35,241
Your plan to kill Lucifer.

57
00:03:35,366 --> 00:03:38,027
- Yeah, you want to help?
- No. It's foolish. It can't be done.

58
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:41,095
- Thanks for the support.
- But I believe I have the solution.

59
00:03:41,443 --> 00:03:44,730
There is someone besides michael
Strong enough to take on Lucifer...

60
00:03:44,855 --> 00:03:47,268
Strong enough to
stop the apocalypse.

61
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,803
Who's that?

62
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,991
The one who resurrected me
and put you on that airplane.

63
00:03:52,116 --> 00:03:54,232
The one who began everything.

64
00:03:54,357 --> 00:03:55,600
God.

65
00:03:58,604 --> 00:04:00,494
I'm gonna find god.

66
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,058
= S05E02 =

67
00:04:04,892 --> 00:04:08,152
Supernatural Team

68
00:04:09,897 --> 00:04:11,222
- God?
- Yes.

69
00:04:11,347 --> 00:04:12,575
- God.
- Yes.

70
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,844
He isn't in heaven.
He has to be somewhere.

71
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:17,498
Try New Mexico. I hear
he's on a tortilla.

72
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:19,901
No, he's not on any flatbread.

73
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:23,337
Listen, chuckles,
even if there is a god,

74
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:25,559
He is either dead and
that's the generous theory.

75
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:28,264
- He is out there.
- Or he's up and kicking

76
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:31,169
And doesn't give a rat's
ass about any of us.

77
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,334
Look around you, man. The
world is in the toilet.

78
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:37,671
We are literally at
the end of days here,

79
00:04:37,796 --> 00:04:40,885
And he's off somewhere
drinking booze out of a coconut.

80
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,498
- All right?
- Enough.

81
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,629
This is not a theological issue.

82
00:04:44,754 --> 00:04:48,052
It's strategic.
With god's help, we can win.

83
00:04:48,177 --> 00:04:49,497
It's a pipe dream, Cass.

84
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,082
I killed two angels this week.

85
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:55,241
My brothers.
I'm hunted. I rebelled.

86
00:04:55,366 --> 00:04:58,398
And I did it... all
of it... for you. And you failed.

87
00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:01,433
You and your brother
destroyed the world.

88
00:05:01,558 --> 00:05:04,427
And I lost everything...
for nothing.

89
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:10,165
So keep your opinions to yourself.

90
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,639
You didn't drop in just
to tear us a new hole.

91
00:05:15,764 --> 00:05:17,258
What is it you want?

92
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,415
I did come for something.

93
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,758
- An amulet.
- An amulet?

94
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:23,698
What kind?

95
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,907
Very rare, very powerful.

96
00:05:26,032 --> 00:05:29,227
It burns hot in god's presence.
It'll help me find him.

97
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:31,963
A god emf?

98
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:36,845
I don't know what you're talking about.
I got nothing like that.

99
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,237
I know. You don't.

100
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:51,225
- What... this?
- May I borrow it?

101
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,853
Dean. Give it to me.

102
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,687
All right, I guess.

103
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,740
Don't lose it.

104
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:26,135
Great. Now I feel naked.

105
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:28,220
I'll be in touch.

106
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:37,707
When you find god,
tell him to send legs!

107
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,744
Your belt. Your belt!

108
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,752
Here... hold this.

109
00:07:06,032 --> 00:07:07,207
Hello?

110
00:07:07,332 --> 00:07:09,804
Bobby, damn it, can you hear me?

111
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:13,097
- I can't hear you.
- Listen. I need a little help.

112
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,538
Seems I'm up to my ass in demons.

113
00:07:15,663 --> 00:07:17,560
Whole damn town's infested.

114
00:07:17,685 --> 00:07:19,801
Where are you?

115
00:07:19,926 --> 00:07:22,248
Pass... rado.

116
00:07:22,373 --> 00:07:24,243
Coloro... Colorado?

117
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:25,931
River pass, Colorado?

118
00:07:26,056 --> 00:07:27,745
River pass!

119
00:07:28,608 --> 00:07:29,838
You there?

120
00:07:29,963 --> 00:07:31,832
Bobby, it's...

121
00:08:23,697 --> 00:08:25,870
This is the only road in or out.

122
00:08:26,321 --> 00:08:28,248
No signal.

123
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,385
Rufus was right. Demons
got this place locked down.

124
00:08:31,683 --> 00:08:33,588
Looks like we're hiking in.

125
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,014
And the hits just keep on coming.

126
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,741
Hello, boys.

127
00:10:53,113 --> 00:10:55,376
Ellen,
what the heck's going on here?

128
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,261
We're us.

129
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:20,546
Real glad to see you boys.

130
00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:28,065
The can of whup ass I ough
to open on you.

131
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,697
You can't pick up a phone?

132
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,234
What are you... allergic
to giving me peace of mind?

133
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:34,837
I got to find out that
you're alive from Rufus?!

134
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:36,699
- Sorry, ellen.
- Yeah, you better be.

135
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:39,009
You better put me
on speed dial, kid.

136
00:11:39,134 --> 00:11:40,418
Yes, ma'am.

137
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,053
What's going on, ellen?

138
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:52,854
More than I can handle alone.

139
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,719
- How many demons are there?
- Pretty much... whole town,

140
00:11:55,844 --> 00:11:58,181
Minus the dead people
and these guys.

141
00:11:58,911 --> 00:12:01,153
So... this is it, right?

142
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,200
End times?

143
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,409
It's got to be.

144
00:12:06,534 --> 00:12:07,668
Seems like it.

145
00:12:12,182 --> 00:12:13,273
It's me.

146
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:38,256
This is Sam and Dean.
They're hunters... here to help.

147
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,732
You guys hip to this
whole demon thing?

148
00:12:40,857 --> 00:12:42,170
Yeah. Are you?

149
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:45,773
My wife's eyes turned black.
She came at me with a brick.

150
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,134
Kind of makes you
embrace the paranormal.

151
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,014
All right, catch us up.

152
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,915
I doubt I know much more than you.

153
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:57,419
Rufus called... said he was
in town investigating omens.

154
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,486
All of a sudden, the
whole town was possessed.

155
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,863
- Me and Jo were nearby...
- You're hunting with Jo?

156
00:13:02,521 --> 00:13:03,892
Yeah, for a while now.

157
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,916
We got here, and the place...

158
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,411
the place was like you see it.

159
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,287
Couldn't find Rufus. Then
me and Jo got separated.

160
00:13:10,412 --> 00:13:12,234
I was out looking when I found you.

161
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,935
Don't worry. We'll find her.

162
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,342
Either way, these people
cannot just sit here.

163
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:17,805
We got to get them out now.

164
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,774
No, it's not that
easy. I've been trying.

165
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,980
- We already made a run for it once.
- What happened?

166
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:23,718
There used to be 20 of us.

167
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,605
There's three of us now.

168
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,289
You don't know what it's like out there.
Demons are everywhere.

169
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:37,232
- We won't be able to cover everybody.
- What if we get everyone guns?

170
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:39,688
What... are you gonna
arm up baby bump over here?

171
00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:42,423
More salt we can fire at once,
more demons we can keep away.

172
00:13:46,338 --> 00:13:48,899
There's a sporting-goods store
we passed on main on the way in.

173
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:50,596
I bet they got guns.

174
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,041
All right. You stay.

175
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,709
- We'll go.
- What about...

176
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,590
If Jo and Rufus are out
there, we'll bring them back.

177
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:07,689
Hold on.

178
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,191
Why don't I just go?

179
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,973
What? Alone?

180
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:14,159
Yeah. Somebody's got to stay here
and start giving them shotgun 101.

181
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:17,647
It's gonna go a lot faster
if you stay and help, okay?

182
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,690
While you go get guns and
salt and look for Jo and Rufus?

183
00:14:20,815 --> 00:14:22,672
- That's stupid.
- I can handle it.

184
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:28,791
You don't want me going out there.

185
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:29,993
I didn't say that.

186
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:31,907
- Around demons.
- I didn't say that.

187
00:14:32,032 --> 00:14:33,644
Fine. Then let's go.

188
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,556
I'll get the salt. You get the guns.

189
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,025
- We'll go together.
- It's right there.

190
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,439
Can we at least do
this like professionals?

191
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,182
Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus.

192
00:16:58,763 --> 00:17:00,978
You know your way
around a gun at all?

193
00:17:14,252 --> 00:17:16,121
Where'd you serve?

194
00:17:16,246 --> 00:17:18,538
Fallujah... two tours.

195
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,272
Got back a little over a year ago.

196
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:24,649
Takes one to know one.
Where'd you serve?

197
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:26,503
Hell.

198
00:17:27,054 --> 00:17:29,459
No, seriously.

199
00:17:29,584 --> 00:17:30,867
Seriously.

200
00:17:30,992 --> 00:17:32,492
Hell.

201
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,858
What's wrong?

202
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,092
Just... at the store.

203
00:17:56,217 --> 00:17:58,798
Those demons were
possessing teenagers.

204
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,757
I had to slit some kid's throat.

205
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:05,499
- Come on, Sam. You had to.
- I know. I just... it used to be...

206
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:11,400
I just wish I could save
people, like I used to.

207
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,906
What... you mean when you were
all hopped up on demon blood?

208
00:18:16,031 --> 00:18:18,011
I didn't say that.

209
00:18:18,136 --> 00:18:20,007
- I'll be back.
- Where you going?

210
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,970
I can't sit here on my ass.
My daughter's out there somewhere.

211
00:18:23,095 --> 00:18:25,597
I'm not back in half an hour, go.
Get these people out of here.

212
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:28,460
No, wait. I'll go with you.

213
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:30,786
Hold on.
Can I talk to you for a second?

214
00:18:35,154 --> 00:18:36,839
You're gonna go out there again?

215
00:18:36,964 --> 00:18:39,012
Crap doesn't hit
the fan with coffee breaks.

216
00:18:39,137 --> 00:18:40,078
I'll go.

217
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,581
It's fine. Just stay here, get'em
ready. I'll cover ellen.

218
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:45,402
- Why's it got to be you?
- Oh, that's right. I forgot.

219
00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:48,819
You think I'll take one look at a demon
And suddenly fall off the wagon,

220
00:18:48,944 --> 00:18:51,670
As if, after everything,
I haven't learned my lesson.

221
00:18:52,442 --> 00:18:53,642
Have you?

222
00:18:56,813 --> 00:18:58,832
If you actually think...

223
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:16,040
So, where'd you see her last?

224
00:19:16,165 --> 00:19:17,475
Up ahead.

225
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,619
So, what's up with you and Dean?

226
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,469
It was hard not to notice...

227
00:19:26,594 --> 00:19:28,915
How different things are
between you guys these days.

228
00:19:30,968 --> 00:19:32,799
Lot of bad road there, huh?

229
00:19:32,924 --> 00:19:35,451
What happened? Some girl
come between you or something?

230
00:19:35,854 --> 00:19:38,889
Just... stresses of the job.
You know how it is.

231
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:42,100
Kind of surprised...
you and Jo hunting.

232
00:19:42,225 --> 00:19:44,569
Weren't you always saying
she couldn't hack the life?

233
00:19:44,694 --> 00:19:46,209
She can't.

234
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:48,339
But if she's gonna do it anyway...

235
00:19:48,464 --> 00:19:49,969
You want to keep an eye on her.

236
00:19:56,072 --> 00:19:58,591
- Is that a chimney going?
- Looks like it.

237
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,238
Come on.

238
00:20:18,475 --> 00:20:20,744
Guess we found base camp.

239
00:20:25,554 --> 00:20:27,960
Demons don't get cold.

240
00:20:30,136 --> 00:20:32,240
Makes you wonder
what they're burning.

241
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,248
Don't move, you evil skank!

242
00:20:55,141 --> 00:20:57,109
Don't you hurt her. Don't you...

243
00:20:57,234 --> 00:21:00,235
Give me my mom back,
you black-eyed bitch!

244
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,891
Ellen! Run!

245
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:18,725
Got you now, you bastard.

246
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,610
No way you're getting out of those.

247
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,911
Did you up myself.

248
00:21:52,403 --> 00:21:54,827
You're stuck right where i want you.

249
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:00,735
You evil son of a bitch.

250
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,482
Wait. Just wait.

251
00:22:16,937 --> 00:22:18,628
Exorcizamus te.

252
00:22:20,155 --> 00:22:21,085
Stop!

253
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,596
Omnis satanica.

254
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,176
Please!

255
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:26,895
"The lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want."

256
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,158
"He layeth me down
in green pastures,"

257
00:22:29,283 --> 00:22:31,140
"and he raiseth me up again."

258
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,730
"Yea, though i walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,"

259
00:22:33,855 --> 00:22:35,228
"i shall fear no evil.

260
00:22:45,856 --> 00:22:47,077
Where's Sam?

261
00:22:53,844 --> 00:22:54,998
They took him?

262
00:22:55,429 --> 00:22:56,874
Demons took him?

263
00:22:58,524 --> 00:22:59,418
Oh, my god.

264
00:22:59,709 --> 00:23:01,818
What if they're in here...
the demons?

265
00:23:01,943 --> 00:23:04,048
- Could they get in?
- No.

266
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:07,971
Everybody sit tight.
I got to...

267
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,108
We need to get a plan together.
Tell me everything.

268
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:24,485
Please! Come on!

269
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,118
Omnis immundus.

270
00:23:26,243 --> 00:23:28,495
Look.
Something's not right.

271
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:29,911
Do you see that?

272
00:23:32,604 --> 00:23:33,540
Come on!

273
00:23:33,905 --> 00:23:35,639
Stop.
Listen to me.

274
00:23:46,209 --> 00:23:47,132
Wait a second.

275
00:23:47,257 --> 00:23:49,567
- Why isn't it working?
- I don't know.

276
00:23:50,116 --> 00:23:51,814
Listen to me.
Something's not right.

277
00:23:51,939 --> 00:23:53,890
But he's not as strong
as he thinks he is.

278
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:55,444
You can see that.

279
00:23:55,785 --> 00:23:57,679
Please. Please.

280
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:59,269
Just listen to me.

281
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,021
Dean, one of them's in Jo.

282
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,360
We got to get it out
without hurting her.

283
00:24:04,168 --> 00:24:05,568
It called me a bitch.

284
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,072
- Bruise a little easy, don't you think?
- No, that's not what i meant.

285
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:12,450
It called me a black-eyed bitch.

286
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:15,964
What kind of demons are these?

287
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:17,649
Holy water and salt roll right off.

288
00:24:17,774 --> 00:24:19,976
My daughter may be an idiot,
but she's not stupid.

289
00:24:20,101 --> 00:24:22,010
She wears an anti-possession charm.

290
00:24:24,573 --> 00:24:26,160
It's all kind of weird, right?

291
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,049
The whole thing's off.

292
00:24:28,381 --> 00:24:30,779
- What's your instinct?
- My instinct?

293
00:24:31,298 --> 00:24:33,871
My instinct is to call Bobby
and ask for help. Or Sam.

294
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,629
Well, tough. All you got's me,
and all i got's you.

295
00:24:36,754 --> 00:24:38,800
So let's figure it out.

296
00:24:38,925 --> 00:24:39,976
All right.

297
00:24:42,971 --> 00:24:44,578
Do you know why Rufus came to town?

298
00:24:44,703 --> 00:24:46,183
Was there a specific omen?

299
00:24:46,476 --> 00:24:47,839
He said something about water.

300
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:49,394
That's all i know.

301
00:24:50,102 --> 00:24:52,800
Padre, you know
what she's talking about the water?

302
00:24:54,406 --> 00:24:57,020
The river ran polluted
all of a sudden.

303
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,255
When?

304
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,109
Last wednesday.

305
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:02,199
And the demon thing
started up the next day.

306
00:25:03,012 --> 00:25:04,816
Anything else?
Anything.

307
00:25:07,318 --> 00:25:08,936
Maybe.
But it's pretty random.

308
00:25:09,061 --> 00:25:10,188
Good. Random's good.

309
00:25:10,313 --> 00:25:12,147
Shooting star does that count?

310
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:14,887
Real big.
Same night, wednesday.

311
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,653
That definitely counts.

312
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:31,059
So you think that all this comes
from outer space?

313
00:25:31,184 --> 00:25:33,364
This isn't "X-Files", pal.

314
00:25:37,772 --> 00:25:39,830
"And there fell
a great star from heaven,

315
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,575
burning like a torch,
and it fell upon the river,

316
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,034
and the name of the star
was Wormwood.

317
00:25:45,257 --> 00:25:46,524
And many men died."

318
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:48,328
Revelation 8:10.

319
00:25:48,453 --> 00:25:51,966
Are you saying that this is
about the apocalypse?

320
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:54,638
You could say.

321
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,513
And these specific omens
they're prelude to what?

322
00:25:57,949 --> 00:25:59,188
The four horsemen.

323
00:25:59,313 --> 00:26:00,897
And which one rides the red horse?

324
00:26:01,022 --> 00:26:01,856
War.

325
00:26:03,042 --> 00:26:04,976
That cherry mustang parked on main?

326
00:26:05,101 --> 00:26:06,502
You can't think that a car...

327
00:26:06,627 --> 00:26:08,048
it's the way i'd roll.

328
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:12,688
I mean, think about it.

329
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:14,211
It all makes sense.

330
00:26:14,336 --> 00:26:15,913
If War is a dude and he's here,

331
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:17,646
maybe he's messing with our heads.

332
00:26:17,771 --> 00:26:19,016
Turning us on each other.

333
00:26:19,141 --> 00:26:20,954
You said Jo called you
a black-eyed bitch.

334
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,696
They think we're demons.
We think they're demons.

335
00:26:23,821 --> 00:26:26,512
What if there are no demons at all
and we're all just killing each other?

336
00:26:26,637 --> 00:26:28,279
Wait just back up.

337
00:26:28,404 --> 00:26:29,795
It's the apocalypse?

338
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:31,505
Sorry, padre.

339
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,217
Who the hell are you?

340
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:48,188
What are you?

341
00:26:49,657 --> 00:26:52,401
You caught me.
Popped in to watch.

342
00:26:52,866 --> 00:26:54,667
I can hustle like that.

343
00:26:56,394 --> 00:26:58,811
So, the Roger everyone around
here knows... the real Roger?

344
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:00,075
Buried in a ditch.

345
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,646
So, who are you?

346
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,853
Here's a hint.

347
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,801
I was in germany.

348
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:16,231
Then in germany.

349
00:27:16,697 --> 00:27:18,457
Then in the middle east.

350
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:21,722
I was in Darfur
when my beeper went off.

351
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,057
I'm waiting to hook up
with my siblings.

352
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:25,993
I've got three.

353
00:27:27,033 --> 00:27:28,949
We're gonna have
so much fun together.

354
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:34,315
I know who you are.

355
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,877
There aren't any demons
in town, are there?

356
00:27:38,827 --> 00:27:41,634
Just frightened people ripping
each other's throats out.

357
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,325
I really haven't had to do too much.

358
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,293
Take out a bridge here,
lay in a little hallucination there...

359
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,376
sit back, pop some corn,
watch the show.

360
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:55,114
Frankly, you're really vicious
little animals, Sam.

361
00:27:56,486 --> 00:27:58,295
- You're doing this.
- Please.

362
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,287
Last week, this was Mayberry.

363
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,429
Now these people are stabbing
each other's children.

364
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,063
'cause you made them see demons!

365
00:28:04,188 --> 00:28:07,156
Honestly, people don't need
a reason to kill each other.

366
00:28:07,281 --> 00:28:09,243
I mean, you seen the irish?

367
00:28:09,368 --> 00:28:11,158
They're all irish.

368
00:28:14,397 --> 00:28:16,455
You think I'm a monster.

369
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,488
I'm jello shots at a party.
I just remove inhibitions.

370
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,990
I'm gonna kill you myself.

371
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:25,130
That's adorable, considering
you're my poster boy.

372
00:28:27,126 --> 00:28:28,913
What's that supposed to mean?

373
00:28:29,634 --> 00:28:31,992
You can't stop thinking about it...

374
00:28:32,117 --> 00:28:34,502
Ever since you saw it dripping
off the blade of that knife.

375
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,670
You're wrong.

376
00:28:37,795 --> 00:28:39,675
Save your protests for your brother.

377
00:28:40,915 --> 00:28:42,475
I can see inside your head.

378
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,930
And, it is one-track city in there.

379
00:28:45,428 --> 00:28:47,974
Blood, blood, blood.

380
00:28:54,921 --> 00:28:56,009
Lust.

381
00:28:56,891 --> 00:28:58,133
For power.

382
00:28:58,258 --> 00:28:59,879
Same as always.

383
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,631
You want to be strong again.

384
00:29:01,756 --> 00:29:03,815
But not just strong.

385
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,058
Stronger than everybody.

386
00:29:06,968 --> 00:29:10,720
Good intentions...
Quick slide to hell, buddy boy.

387
00:29:13,924 --> 00:29:15,260
You feel bad now?

388
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,670
Wait till you're thigh-deep
in warm corpses.

389
00:29:19,496 --> 00:29:23,135
Because, my friend,
i'm just getting started.

390
00:29:33,783 --> 00:29:35,773
Showtime for the meat suits.

391
00:29:36,236 --> 00:29:37,602
Watch this.

392
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:54,364
He did it!

393
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,018
He said they're coming!
He said they're coming to get us!

394
00:29:58,499 --> 00:30:00,726
Stop.
Jo, Rufus, he's lying.

395
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:02,052
You shut your mouth.

396
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:03,455
Jo! He's lying!

397
00:30:04,504 --> 00:30:06,840
So, now you're saying
that there are no demons

398
00:30:06,965 --> 00:30:08,680
and that War is a guy.

399
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:10,272
You believed crazy before.

400
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,705
Open up! Let me in!

401
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,018
It's Roger!

402
00:30:17,257 --> 00:30:19,732
I saw them... The demons.

403
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:22,216
They know we're trying to leave.

404
00:30:22,442 --> 00:30:24,530
They said they're gonna
pick us off one by one.

405
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,646
- What?
- You said there were no demons.

406
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:28,170
There's not.
Where did you go?

407
00:30:28,295 --> 00:30:30,055
Someone should go out,
see what's going on!

408
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,180
Where did you see the demons,
what did they say?

409
00:30:32,305 --> 00:30:34,582
- We just sit here, we're gonna be dead.
- No, we're not!

410
00:30:34,946 --> 00:30:37,062
- They're gonna kill us...
- Unless we kill them first.

411
00:30:37,187 --> 00:30:39,412
- Hold on.
- No, we got people to protect.

412
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:42,175
The able-bodied go,
hunt some demons.

413
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,823
Slow your roll.
This is not a demon thing.

414
00:30:49,637 --> 00:30:50,889
Look at their eyes!

415
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:52,470
They're demons!

416
00:31:09,422 --> 00:31:10,534
Hope those are real.

417
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,089
Those two could have been demons
the entire time.

418
00:31:13,406 --> 00:31:15,138
All this salt and holy-water talk...

419
00:31:15,263 --> 00:31:18,135
as far as i'm concerned,
it's all crap.

420
00:31:19,353 --> 00:31:20,602
Are you sure?

421
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,777
It's them or us.

422
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,341
I think i saw some knives
in the kitchen.

423
00:31:25,736 --> 00:31:27,582
Great.
Go.

424
00:31:38,949 --> 00:31:39,813
Hey, Rufus.

425
00:31:41,631 --> 00:31:43,241
Pipe bombs won't kill a demon.

426
00:31:43,366 --> 00:31:44,632
Right.

427
00:31:46,146 --> 00:31:47,841
But in my experience...

428
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,989
Demons come at you slower

429
00:31:52,114 --> 00:31:54,258
if they're in a body with no limbs.

430
00:31:54,383 --> 00:31:55,955
One of them is in my mother.

431
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:02,628
Jo, listen to me. You know
i'm gonna do everything i can.

432
00:32:02,846 --> 00:32:04,346
Your mom's gonna be okay.

433
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:09,213
Unless she comes
through that window.

434
00:32:23,844 --> 00:32:25,323
All right, let's move.

435
00:32:26,158 --> 00:32:28,194
Stay low. Move fast.

436
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:27,909
Now, you listen up,
Joanna Beth Harvelle.

437
00:33:31,758 --> 00:33:33,927
Listen to me.
I'm not a demon.

438
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:35,846
Think, Rufus.
All those omens.

439
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:37,085
You go to hell.

440
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,442
The polluted water,
the shooting star,

441
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:50,237
the red mustang...
It's War.

442
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:51,862
I'm telling you, it's War.

443
00:33:56,152 --> 00:33:57,669
You're damn right it is.

444
00:34:01,045 --> 00:34:02,039
The horseman!

445
00:34:02,386 --> 00:34:03,486
- Horseman?
- Yes!

446
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,400
He's turning us against each other.

447
00:34:05,525 --> 00:34:06,951
You're hallucinating.

448
00:34:12,202 --> 00:34:14,551
The horseman.
War.

449
00:34:14,874 --> 00:34:15,843
Yes.

450
00:34:18,006 --> 00:34:20,057
Did you figure this out
all by yourself, genius?

451
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:34,610
We all on the same page?

452
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:37,367
Good.

453
00:34:37,797 --> 00:34:38,847
Hi, Jo.

454
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,275
We got to find War before everybody
in this town kills each other.

455
00:34:47,765 --> 00:34:48,713
Damn it!

456
00:34:49,232 --> 00:34:50,673
Where's Sam?
Upstairs.

457
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,095
You three go around back.

458
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,302
Take the alley.

459
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:01,312
Dean.
It's not demons.

460
00:35:01,437 --> 00:35:02,755
- It's War.
- War.

461
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,855
I just can't figure out
how he's doing it.

462
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,061
The ring.

463
00:35:07,054 --> 00:35:08,242
The ring, that's right.

464
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:10,573
He turned it right before
he made everybody hallucinate

465
00:35:10,698 --> 00:35:12,190
- and go hellbitch.
- Right.

466
00:35:13,738 --> 00:35:15,154
We got to move.
Come on.

467
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,354
People, cease fire!

468
00:35:39,176 --> 00:35:40,345
Stop shooting!

469
00:35:40,668 --> 00:35:41,667
Stop!

470
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:45,850
I'm getting too old for this.

471
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:05,491
I'm not what you think, honey.
Come on, keep this right here.

472
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:14,630
"Stop firing" usually means
"stop firing."

473
00:36:54,758 --> 00:36:56,201
That's a sweet little knife.

474
00:36:56,629 --> 00:36:57,656
But come on.

475
00:36:57,781 --> 00:36:59,622
You can't kill War, kiddos.

476
00:36:59,747 --> 00:37:01,260
We know.

477
00:37:46,603 --> 00:37:48,557
So, pit stop on mount doom?

478
00:37:57,837 --> 00:37:59,210
- Dean.
- Sam, let's not.

479
00:37:59,335 --> 00:38:01,147
No, listen.
This is important.

480
00:38:02,017 --> 00:38:03,405
I know you don't trust me.

481
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,776
Just, now i realize something.

482
00:38:09,545 --> 00:38:10,787
I don't trust me either.

483
00:38:12,382 --> 00:38:13,874
From the minute i saw that blood,

484
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,290
only thought in my head...

485
00:38:19,553 --> 00:38:23,148
and i tell myself
it's for the right reasons,

486
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,608
my intentions are good,

487
00:38:24,733 --> 00:38:26,557
and it feels true, you know?

488
00:38:27,726 --> 00:38:29,513
But i think, underneath...

489
00:38:31,971 --> 00:38:34,268
... i just miss the feeling.

490
00:38:35,777 --> 00:38:37,511
I know how messed up that sounds,

491
00:38:37,906 --> 00:38:40,253
which means
i know how messed up i am.

492
00:38:42,499 --> 00:38:45,206
Thing is, the problem's not
the demon blood, not really.

493
00:38:45,331 --> 00:38:48,466
An, what i did,
i can't blame the blood or ruby

494
00:38:50,113 --> 00:38:51,236
or anything.

495
00:38:54,404 --> 00:38:55,999
The problem's me.

496
00:38:57,415 --> 00:38:59,378
How far I'll go.

497
00:39:02,587 --> 00:39:04,698
There's something in me that...

498
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:08,936
scares the hell out of me.

499
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:11,916
And the last couple days,
I caught another glimpse.

500
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:17,568
So, what are you saying?

501
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:20,649
I'm in no shape to be hunting.

502
00:39:21,779 --> 00:39:25,521
I need to step back,
'cause I'm dangerous.

503
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:32,125
Maybe it's best we just...
Go our separate ways.

504
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,576
I think you're right.

505
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:45,770
I was expecting a fight.

506
00:39:45,895 --> 00:39:48,301
Truth is, I spend more time
worrying about you

507
00:39:48,716 --> 00:39:50,904
than about doing the job right.

508
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,918
And I just...
I can't afford that, you know?

509
00:39:55,171 --> 00:39:56,524
Not now.

510
00:40:02,214 --> 00:40:03,275
I'm sorry, Dean.

511
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,040
I know you are, Sam.

512
00:40:14,182 --> 00:40:16,038
Hey, you...

513
00:40:18,729 --> 00:40:20,459
Want to take the impala?

514
00:40:23,016 --> 00:40:24,171
That's okay.

515
00:40:37,864 --> 00:40:39,519
Take care of yourself, Dean.

516
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,940
You too, Sammy.

517
