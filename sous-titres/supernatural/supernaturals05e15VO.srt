1
00:00:03,649 --> 00:00:06,547
Are you saying that this
is the... Apocalypse?

2
00:00:07,071 --> 00:00:09,132
And these specific omens,
they're prelude to what?

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,900
- The four horsesen.
- And which one rides the red horse?

4
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:12,761
War.

5
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:15,308
This town is suffering from famine.

6
00:00:15,912 --> 00:00:17,974
- As in the horseman?
- Great.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,270
The angel of death
must be brought into this world

8
00:00:22,686 --> 00:00:25,208
through a place of awful carnage.

9
00:00:25,413 --> 00:00:27,281
Hello, death

10
00:00:27,701 --> 00:00:29,904
- Bobby, who is that?
- She's my wife.

11
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:31,408
It's the end of the world.

12
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:33,699
And if I don't stop it
and save everyone,

13
00:00:33,824 --> 00:00:36,118
then no one will and we all die.

14
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:40,010
I'm just tired, man.

15
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:42,657
I'm done.

16
00:00:43,297 --> 00:00:44,545
I am just done.

17
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:46,465
I need some help.

18
00:01:17,782 --> 00:01:20,020
Here on the savanna,
the wildebeest lounges,

19
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:21,642
lazy and self-content...

20
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:23,374
And oblivious to the fierce predator

21
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,051
that stalks him from the shadows.

22
00:01:25,288 --> 00:01:26,660
The predator is the cheetah...

23
00:01:26,785 --> 00:01:29,090
... Perhaps smaller
than other big cats,

24
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:31,416
but the world's fastest land mammal,

25
00:01:33,804 --> 00:01:36,929
Capable of speeds up
to 70 miles per hour.

26
00:01:59,592 --> 00:02:02,235
Finally, the slow-witted wildebeest

27
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,926
begins to sense the
danger it's in, but...

28
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:49,137
Who are closing in for the kill.

29
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,160
When it attacks, it attacks quickly.

30
00:02:54,518 --> 00:02:56,152
Please! God! No!

31
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,076
= 515 =

32
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:06,310
= Supernatural Team =

33
00:03:08,358 --> 00:03:12,339
Bobby, listen, when you
get this message, call!

34
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,303
Is he still not home?
How far could he get in that chair?

35
00:03:22,006 --> 00:03:23,130
So, what do we do?

36
00:03:27,182 --> 00:03:29,766
Guess we just do it ourselves.

37
00:03:33,645 --> 00:03:36,340
Mr. Wells, why don't you tell us
what you saw in your own words.

38
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,068
- Call me digger.
- Digger?

39
00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:42,096
- Who gave you that name?
- I did.

40
00:03:42,495 --> 00:03:44,067
You gave yourself your own nickname?

41
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:46,705
You can't do that.
Who died and made you queen?

42
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:50,747
Why don't you just tell us
what you saw?

43
00:03:51,737 --> 00:03:55,704
I saw Clay Thompson climb
into Benny sutton's trailer

44
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:57,175
through the window.

45
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,004
Couple minutes later, Clay walked out,
and Benny's dead.

46
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:02,659
And...

47
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,528
Is this the guy you saw?

48
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:09,092
He was all covered with mud, but, yeah.
That's Clay.

49
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:12,166
And you are aware that Clay Thompson
died five years ago?

50
00:04:12,748 --> 00:04:13,459
Yep.

51
00:04:14,164 --> 00:04:16,748
And you're positive
that it was this guy.

52
00:04:17,502 --> 00:04:20,171
- You calling me a liar?
- No. Of course not.

53
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:21,540
Look.

54
00:04:21,768 --> 00:04:23,871
Can you think of any reason
why Clay Thompson...

55
00:04:23,996 --> 00:04:25,096
alive or dead...

56
00:04:25,553 --> 00:04:27,162
would want to kill Benny Sutton?

57
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:28,820
Hell, yeah.

58
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,630
Five years ago,

59
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:32,968
Benny's the one that killed
Clay in the first place.

60
00:04:34,252 --> 00:04:35,218
Is that a fact?

61
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:37,276
Yeah, so-called "hunting accident."

62
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:39,020
Now, if you ask me...

63
00:04:40,616 --> 00:04:43,407
Clay came back from the grave
to get a little payback.

64
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:47,493
Go on.

65
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:51,416
Owen, put down the cupcake
and pick up an apple.

66
00:04:53,523 --> 00:04:54,831
Okay. I love you.

67
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:02,234
Heads up.
"Fargo."

68
00:05:03,356 --> 00:05:05,899
- Digger.
- Sheriff.

69
00:05:06,812 --> 00:05:10,097
Gentlemen. I'm sheriff Jody Mills.
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

70
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:11,991
Agents Dorfman and Neidermeyer.

71
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,029
FBI

72
00:05:13,384 --> 00:05:14,938
Welcome to Sioux Falls, gentlemen.

73
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,459
Can I ask you what you're
doing with digger here?

74
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:20,187
They doing their job.

75
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:22,613
They believe me... sheriff.

76
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:28,196
The FBI believes a dead
man committed a murder?

77
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:30,509
We're just asking a few questions.
That's all.

78
00:05:30,634 --> 00:05:32,330
If a dead man
didn't commit the murder

79
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:33,862
then who did?

80
00:05:35,457 --> 00:05:37,378
What'd you say your jurisdiction
here was again?

81
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:40,492
Our jurisdiction is wherever
the United States government sends us.

82
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:43,751
How'bout me and your supervisor
have a little chat about that?

83
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,138
Absolutely.

84
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:02,069
Agent Willis speaking.

85
00:06:02,358 --> 00:06:05,061
Agent Willis,
this is sheriff Jody Mills...

86
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:06,990
Bobby?

87
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:11,363
Excuse me?

88
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,338
Is this Bobby Singer?

89
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:16,693
Listen, I don't know
who this is, but...

90
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:19,195
This is Agent Tom Willis of the FBI.

91
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,624
Bull crap.

92
00:06:22,712 --> 00:06:23,549
FBI?

93
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:25,700
So...

94
00:06:26,856 --> 00:06:28,408
So you know Bobby singer?

95
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:31,351
That is... A fun coincidence.

96
00:06:32,247 --> 00:06:34,095
Here's what I know
about Bobby Singer.

97
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,599
He's a menace around here...

98
00:06:35,724 --> 00:06:38,293
Ass-full of drunk-and-disorderlies
and mail fraud.

99
00:06:38,418 --> 00:06:41,009
- You understanding me?
- I think we all can agree

100
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,286
that you've made yourself
perfectly clear, yes.

101
00:06:43,411 --> 00:06:47,073
So, whatever the three of you
are planning, it ends here.

102
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,615
Now!

103
00:06:49,152 --> 00:06:51,094
Ten-four on that, agents?

104
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:52,301
Yeah.

105
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:57,718
You know how many times we called?

106
00:06:58,054 --> 00:06:59,185
Where have you been?

107
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,037
Playing murderball.

108
00:07:01,944 --> 00:07:03,223
What's that smell?

109
00:07:03,784 --> 00:07:04,816
Is that soap?

110
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:06,848
- Did you clean?
- What are you, my mother?

111
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:08,691
- Bite me!
- Bobby, seriously.

112
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:10,035
I been working.

113
00:07:10,614 --> 00:07:12,271
Trying to find a way
to stop the devil.

114
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:14,316
Find anything? What do you think?

115
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,571
Bobby, it's just

116
00:07:16,987 --> 00:07:17,978
there's a case

117
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:20,355
less than five miles
from your house.

118
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:22,514
What, the the Benny Sutton thing?

119
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,665
- That's what this is about?
- You knew about this?

120
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:27,407
Hell, yes. I checked into it already.
There's nothing here.

121
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:29,615
Except a witness who saw
a dead guy commit murder.

122
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:32,867
- What witness? Digger Wells?
- Yeah. So?

123
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,065
So, he's a drunk.

124
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,660
What about the lightning storms?

125
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,924
- They look like omens.
- Except in February

126
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,357
in South Dakota in storm season.

127
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,586
Guys, I thought it
was something, too.

128
00:07:44,227 --> 00:07:46,220
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.

129
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:47,599
So who killed the guy?

130
00:07:47,724 --> 00:07:48,830
Take your pick.

131
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,637
This Benny Sutton guy was
a grade-a son of a bitch.

132
00:07:52,256 --> 00:07:53,987
There's a list
of the living a year long

133
00:07:54,112 --> 00:07:55,864
wouldn't mind putting
a cap in his ass.

134
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:57,850
So, you're telling us... nothing?

135
00:07:58,919 --> 00:07:59,895
Sorry.

136
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,147
Looks like you wasted a
tank of gas on this one.

137
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:03,944
All right.

138
00:08:18,138 --> 00:08:19,081
What's up?

139
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,927
Isn't that the graveyard back there?

140
00:08:23,885 --> 00:08:25,879
Yeah. So what?
Bobby already checked it out.

141
00:08:26,637 --> 00:08:28,621
And? What, Bobby's never wrong?

142
00:08:29,915 --> 00:08:32,080
Come on. We'll take a peek,
and then we'll hit the road.

143
00:08:32,205 --> 00:08:33,094
Can't hurt.

144
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:55,181
- That look fresh to you?
- Yeah, actually.

145
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:22,185
What is going on here?

146
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,690
I don't know, but something stinks.

147
00:10:22,812 --> 00:10:25,153
Don't shoot me! Please!
There's money in the safe.

148
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:27,553
- We don't want your money.
- What do you want?

149
00:10:27,678 --> 00:10:28,844
Anything. Please...

150
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,284
You're Clay Thompson, right?

151
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,156
Who are you?

152
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:38,146
- FBI.
- FBI?

153
00:10:39,294 --> 00:10:40,931
Oh, my God. This is about Benny.

154
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,223
What about Benny?

155
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,002
He killed me!
He shot me in the back!

156
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:45,919
I'm supposed to let him
get away with that?

157
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:47,693
Hold up. Are you confessing?

158
00:10:47,877 --> 00:10:51,517
Please. I'll go with you.
Just don't wake my kids.

159
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:54,735
You'll go with us where?

160
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,612
Jail.

161
00:10:57,038 --> 00:10:58,294
Let me get this straight.

162
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,294
You're Clay Thompson,
and you died five years ago?

163
00:11:02,856 --> 00:11:04,787
And three days ago you
climbed out of your grave,

164
00:11:04,912 --> 00:11:06,311
and you killed Benny Sutton?

165
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:08,380
So you are, in fact, a dead guy.
I guess.

166
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,051
I don't know what I am.

167
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,129
Clay?

168
00:11:14,127 --> 00:11:15,029
I called 911.

169
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:16,990
It's okay, honey.
These men are the FBI.

170
00:11:17,115 --> 00:11:18,379
They're here about Benny.

171
00:11:18,504 --> 00:11:21,054
Why don't you come with us,
Mr. Thompson? I think that'd be best.

172
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:27,157
Dean.

173
00:11:28,077 --> 00:11:29,341
He's a monster.

174
00:11:29,845 --> 00:11:31,686
He's a soccer dad.

175
00:11:31,811 --> 00:11:33,233
What do you want to do with him?

176
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:35,184
Freeze!

177
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,485
Drop your guns!

178
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,042
Remember the guy you
said that was dead

179
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:45,738
and couldn't possibly commit murder?

180
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,538
There he is.

181
00:11:49,156 --> 00:11:49,966
And?

182
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:52,579
"And"?

183
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:54,462
And you're welcome...

184
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,505
for catching the
undead killer zombie.

185
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,192
Whatever he is or isn't that don't
give you the right to shoot him

186
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:01,053
- in the middle of the street.
- Shoot me?

187
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:02,897
- You're free to go.
- Free to go?

188
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,696
I can't believe you
were gonna kill me.

189
00:12:04,821 --> 00:12:06,687
- You're a zombie!
- I'm a taxpayer!

190
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,088
So, what? Sheriff's on the take?

191
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,319
Yeah. No.

192
00:12:17,743 --> 00:12:19,167
The zombies are paying her off?

193
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:32,716
So, what? Now they're friends?

194
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:39,271
Bobby, I thought
the sheriff hated you?

195
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:41,521
She did till five days ago.

196
00:12:41,646 --> 00:12:42,955
What happened five days ago?

197
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,146
The dead started
rising all over town.

198
00:12:46,506 --> 00:12:47,698
So you knew about this?

199
00:12:47,994 --> 00:12:48,858
Yep.

200
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:52,321
I think what Sam meant to say is,
you lied to us?

201
00:12:54,571 --> 00:12:57,818
Look... I told you
there was nothing here.

202
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,403
And there isn't. Not for you.

203
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,494
There are zombies here.

204
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:08,036
There's zombies...
And then there's zombies.

205
00:13:09,651 --> 00:13:10,622
Come with me.

206
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:20,043
You want to tell us what the hell...

207
00:13:26,184 --> 00:13:28,014
I didn't realize you
were bringing company.

208
00:13:28,627 --> 00:13:30,809
00 A.M., babe.
You didn't need to cook.

209
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,495
Oh, pl I'lletre pome mo lates. 

210
00:13:37,795 --> 00:13:38,692
Who was that?

211
00:13:39,178 --> 00:13:40,898
Karen. My wife.

212
00:13:41,266 --> 00:13:42,418
Your new wife?

213
00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:45,531
My dead wife.

214
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:52,535


215
00:13:55,788 --> 00:13:57,461
This is incredible, Mrs. Singer.

216
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:58,934
Thank you, Dean.

217
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:01,949
What? It is.

218
00:14:05,228 --> 00:14:06,561
It's great, Karen. Thanks.

219
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:09,723
Could you, just give us a minute?

220
00:14:20,855 --> 00:14:22,522
Are you crazy? What the hell?

221
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:25,113
- Dean, I can explain.
- Explain what? Lying to us?

222
00:14:25,695 --> 00:14:28,173
Or the American girl zombie
making cupcakes in your kitchen?!

223
00:14:28,298 --> 00:14:30,640
First of all, that's my wife,
so watch it.

224
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:33,547
Bobby, whatever that thing is in there,
it is not your wife.

225
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,597
- And how do you know that?
- Are you serious?

226
00:14:35,722 --> 00:14:37,405
You think I'm an idiot, boy?

227
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:39,657
My dead wife shows
up on my doorstep,

228
00:14:39,782 --> 00:14:41,922
I'm not gonna test her
every way I ever learned?

229
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:46,212
- So what is it? Zombies? Revenant?
- Hell if I can tell.

230
00:14:46,337 --> 00:14:48,645
She's got no scars, no wounds,

231
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:51,791
no reaction to salt,
silver, Holy water...

232
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,770
Bobby,
she crawled out of her coffin.

233
00:14:53,895 --> 00:14:56,102
No, she didn't. I cremated her.

234
00:14:57,911 --> 00:15:00,607
Somehow, some way, she's back.

235
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:01,874
That's impossible.

236
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:03,735
- Tell me about it.
- You bury her ashes?

237
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,185
- Yeah.
- Where?

238
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:06,985
In the cemetery.

239
00:15:07,369 --> 00:15:08,823
That's where they all rose from.

240
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:13,125
How many? 15, 20.
I made a list.

241
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:17,220
There's Karen...

242
00:15:17,557 --> 00:15:18,708
Clay...

243
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:20,255
Sheriff Mills...

244
00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:22,103
her little boy came back.

245
00:15:22,543 --> 00:15:24,623
And there were no signs? No omens?

246
00:15:25,312 --> 00:15:27,633
There were the lightning storms.

247
00:15:28,143 --> 00:15:30,167
That's what we said. What else?

248
00:15:40,632 --> 00:15:44,007
"And through the fire stood
before me a pale horse.

249
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:47,279
And he that sat atop
him carried a scythe,

250
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:50,167
and I saw since he had risen,

251
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:52,032
they, too, shall rise,

252
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,879
and from him and through him."

253
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:01,999
So, what, death is behind this?

254
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:06,089
Li imke "gr reaper" death? 

255
00:16:09,747 --> 00:16:10,861
Awesome.

256
00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:12,432
Another horseman.

257
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:14,197
Must be Thursday.

258
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,101
Bobby...

259
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:20,821
Why would death raise 15 people

260
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:23,325
in a podunk town like Sioux Falls?

261
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,133
I don't know.

262
00:16:26,757 --> 00:16:29,677
You know, if death is behind this,
then whatever these things are...

263
00:16:30,653 --> 00:16:31,790
It's not good.

264
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,802
You know what we have to do here.

265
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:39,497
She doesn't remember anything.

266
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,670
- What do you mean?
- Being possessed.

267
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,988
Me killing her...

268
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,113
Her coming back.

269
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:47,379
Bobby...

270
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:50,241
No, no, don't "Bobby" me.

271
00:16:50,714 --> 00:16:51,881
Just...

272
00:16:53,937 --> 00:16:55,096
Just listen, okay?

273
00:16:59,942 --> 00:17:01,751
She hums when she cooks.

274
00:17:07,177 --> 00:17:08,480
She always...

275
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,209
Used to hum when she cooked.

276
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:14,711
Tone deaf as all hell, but...

277
00:17:19,493 --> 00:17:22,997
And I never thought
I would hear it again.

278
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:30,229
Look, just read revelation.

279
00:17:31,058 --> 00:17:33,437
The dead rise during the apocalypse.

280
00:17:33,589 --> 00:17:36,267
There's nothing in there
that says that's bad!

281
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:38,000
Hell, maybe it's the one good thing

282
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,185
that comes out of this
whole bloody mess.

283
00:17:42,784 --> 00:17:44,437
And what would you
do if you were us?

284
00:17:56,561 --> 00:17:58,265
I know what I'd do.

285
00:17:59,401 --> 00:18:01,721
And I know what you
think you got to do.

286
00:18:02,825 --> 00:18:03,857
But...

287
00:18:04,194 --> 00:18:05,490
I'm begging you.

288
00:18:06,465 --> 00:18:07,753
Please.

289
00:18:09,745 --> 00:18:11,089
Please.

290
00:18:12,521 --> 00:18:13,841
Leave her be.

291
00:18:19,855 --> 00:18:21,176
So, what do you think?

292
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,164
There's nothing to think about.
I'm not gonna leave Bobby at home

293
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:27,026
- with the bride of frankenstein.
- Then what do you want to do?

294
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:29,661
Just walk in there in front
of Bobby and blow her skull off?

295
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:32,625
If she decides that Bobby's face

296
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,814
is the blue plate special,
I'd like to be there.

297
00:18:37,477 --> 00:18:39,401
Fine.
See what else we can find out.

298
00:18:56,707 --> 00:18:58,835
- Oops. Did I scare you?
- No.

299
00:19:00,627 --> 00:19:02,371
There's...
Nothing scary about you at all.

300
00:19:02,496 --> 00:19:03,651
Feel like some lunch?

301
00:19:05,081 --> 00:19:06,311
I'm good. Thanks.

302
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,891
Come on there's more pie.

303
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:10,023
I don't think that
Bobby wants me inside.

304
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,176
Guess it'll have to be
our secret, then?

305
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:13,569
Come on.

306
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:50,562
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and guess that you like pies.

307
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:52,169
Did you bake all these?

308
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:55,049
I don't know what it is.
Since I got back, I can't stop baking.

309
00:19:55,865 --> 00:19:58,661
- When do you have time to sleep?
- I don't.

310
00:19:59,377 --> 00:20:00,833
Must be the excitement.

311
00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:02,367
Or being dead.

312
00:20:08,095 --> 00:20:09,207
You don't trust me.

313
00:20:09,656 --> 00:20:12,126
- Why would you say that?
- Come on, Dean.

314
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,624
That's why you're here.

315
00:20:15,353 --> 00:20:16,903
Keeping an eye on me?

316
00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:22,507
I know who you are.

317
00:20:22,777 --> 00:20:26,140
Just like I know Bobby's not the same
mild-mannered scrap dealer I married.

318
00:20:28,913 --> 00:20:30,213
You hunt things.

319
00:20:33,504 --> 00:20:34,604
I'm a thing.

320
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,484
I get it.

321
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:40,864
Then you know that Sam and I
would never let anything happen to him.

322
00:20:41,215 --> 00:20:43,408
- He's like a father to us.
- I understand.

323
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:45,535
He's lucky to have you
looking out for him.

324
00:20:45,943 --> 00:20:47,843
But you're not the only one.

325
00:20:49,585 --> 00:20:50,635
Is that so?

326
00:20:55,314 --> 00:20:57,193
I remember everything, you know.

327
00:20:58,969 --> 00:21:00,069
When I died.

328
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,802
That demon taking over my body.

329
00:21:04,153 --> 00:21:05,873
And the things it made me do.

330
00:21:07,337 --> 00:21:09,637
And Bobby having no choice but to...

331
00:21:11,598 --> 00:21:12,812
You know what he did.

332
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:18,921
But I can see it in his
eyes when he looks at me.

333
00:21:20,193 --> 00:21:21,193
The guilt.

334
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:23,948
It weighs on him.

335
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:26,371
Just tell him you remember.

336
00:21:30,033 --> 00:21:33,750
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say you've never been in love.

337
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:36,252
He's my husband.

338
00:21:36,765 --> 00:21:38,715
My job is to bring him peace.

339
00:21:40,413 --> 00:21:41,413
Not pain.

340
00:21:56,713 --> 00:21:57,813
Mrs. Jones?!

341
00:22:14,371 --> 00:22:15,421
Ezra Jones?

342
00:22:38,301 --> 00:22:39,351
Ezra Jones?

343
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:56,839
What is it?

344
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:00,753
Maybe you could tell me from here?

345
00:23:04,303 --> 00:23:05,903
I'm gonna regret this.

346
00:23:57,206 --> 00:23:58,206


347
00:24:01,143 --> 00:24:03,943
Keep your damn voices down.
Karen's upstairs.

348
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:06,316
I'm sorry, we're a little tense.

349
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:07,820
Who's old lady Jones?

350
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,106
- The first one to come up.
- First one to go bad.

351
00:24:10,447 --> 00:24:12,643
- She was always a nutty broad.
- Nutty how?

352
00:24:12,768 --> 00:24:14,732
Like the way she ate
her husband's stomach?

353
00:24:14,857 --> 00:24:16,370
That level of nutty?

354
00:24:19,363 --> 00:24:21,084
Look, Bobby, I feel for you.

355
00:24:21,366 --> 00:24:24,253
But you have to acknowledge
you're not seeing this straight!

356
00:24:24,544 --> 00:24:26,835
Whether you admit it or not,
these things are turning.

357
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,050
We have to stop them. All of them.

358
00:24:35,431 --> 00:24:36,481
Time to go.

359
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:38,976
You heard me. Off my property.

360
00:24:40,303 --> 00:24:41,896
Or what? You'll shoot?

361
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,922
If Karen turns,

362
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:46,666
I will handle it my way.

363
00:24:47,346 --> 00:24:48,746
This is dangerous.

364
00:24:51,007 --> 00:24:52,365
I'm not telling you twice.

365
00:25:12,727 --> 00:25:14,720
- He's crazy.
- It's his wife, Dean.

366
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,654
So he goes full metal jacket on us?
We're his family, Sam.

367
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:19,555
Look, man. Bigger fish, okay?

368
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,353
We got zombies about to turn this town
into a giant chew toy.

369
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,780
And he's alone in the house
making pie with one of 'em!

370
00:25:24,905 --> 00:25:26,555
- All right? So?
- So!

371
00:25:28,233 --> 00:25:30,709
I'm gonna have to go back there
and kill her.

372
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:34,507
- That's the only thing I can think of.
- If he sees you, you're dead.

373
00:25:35,366 --> 00:25:37,023
Then, I won't let him see me.

374
00:25:40,232 --> 00:25:42,380
I'll head to town

375
00:25:42,646 --> 00:25:44,946
and rescue everyone. Should be easy.

376
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:46,934
Sounds like.

377
00:25:47,652 --> 00:25:50,234
- I'm gonna need some help.
- What about the sheriff?

378
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:52,341
Last time I checked,
she was pro-zombie.

379
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,051
You'll have to convince her.

380
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:56,846
- How?
- I don't know, you're just gonna.

381
00:25:58,787 --> 00:26:00,702
There. Does that feel better, honey?

382
00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:03,436
I'm so hungry, mommy.

383
00:26:04,277 --> 00:26:06,063
I know. I know...

384
00:26:07,878 --> 00:26:10,378
Mommy's gonna make you some soup,
okay?

385
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:13,792
I don't know what else to tell you,
doc.

386
00:26:13,917 --> 00:26:16,000
We checked the thermometer
three times.

387
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:18,242
His temperature is 111 degrees.

388
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,286
Hold on, doc.

389
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:22,599
- I'm hungry!
- Can you take that in to him?

390
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:28,294
Dr. Dwight, it's Jody mills.

391
00:26:35,472 --> 00:26:37,412
Karen, stay away from the windows.

392
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,529
I'm okay.

393
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:57,367
I'm okay, I just...

394
00:26:58,768 --> 00:26:59,768
I'm okay.

395
00:27:01,964 --> 00:27:03,373
I just got to be dizzy.

396
00:27:06,415 --> 00:27:08,565
- You're burning up.
- I'm okay.

397
00:27:08,902 --> 00:27:10,852
I just need something to eat.

398
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:12,880
And I'll be fine. Really.

399
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,267
I don't know how to explain it,
doctor.

400
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:24,342
That's why we're calling you.

401
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,250
Sean?

402
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,321
Owen?

403
00:28:12,134 --> 00:28:13,134
Let's go!

404
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:17,974
- My husband!
- He's dead!

405
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:20,262
- That was not my son!
- You're right. It wasn't.

406
00:28:20,387 --> 00:28:22,373
Listen, sheriff.
Your town is in danger.

407
00:28:22,498 --> 00:28:25,093
People are in danger,
and we need to help them now.

408
00:28:25,218 --> 00:28:26,575
Can you do that for me?

409
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,700
Can you focus for me, sheriff?

410
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:31,451
Sheriff?

411
00:28:34,557 --> 00:28:36,797
- How do we put them down?
- Head shot.

412
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:46,432
We're gonna need weapons.

413
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:49,758
We can start by rounding up
everybody we can find.

414
00:28:49,883 --> 00:28:52,001
Is there a safe place
we can take people?

415
00:28:52,923 --> 00:28:53,923
Jail.

416
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:56,835
Right.

417
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:03,216
Give me a minute.

418
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,190
I'm so hungry, Bobby.

419
00:29:36,623 --> 00:29:38,859
I'll fix you something to eat...
In a minute.

420
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,912
I can feel it.

421
00:29:41,665 --> 00:29:42,915
It's happening.

422
00:29:44,036 --> 00:29:45,408
It's gonna be all right.

423
00:29:48,029 --> 00:29:49,029
It's not.

424
00:29:49,905 --> 00:29:51,038
I'm turning, Bobby.

425
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,980
You know I am.

426
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:05,067
It's okay.

427
00:30:05,587 --> 00:30:06,804
- Do it.
- No way.

428
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,272
- Please.
- No.

429
00:30:13,393 --> 00:30:14,443
I remember.

430
00:30:17,476 --> 00:30:18,566
You remember what?

431
00:30:20,031 --> 00:30:21,081
Everything.

432
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:24,971
The demon inside me.

433
00:30:25,641 --> 00:30:26,891
You killing me.

434
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,368
I remember.

435
00:30:30,636 --> 00:30:31,936
Then you know...

436
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:34,798
Why I can't do it again.

437
00:30:41,068 --> 00:30:43,090
I remember something else, too.

438
00:30:44,686 --> 00:30:46,136
When I came back...

439
00:30:47,323 --> 00:30:50,598
- There was a man.
- What do you mean, a man?

440
00:30:51,229 --> 00:30:52,349
At the grave.

441
00:30:53,189 --> 00:30:54,439
He was so thin.

442
00:30:54,712 --> 00:30:56,012
Like a skeleton.

443
00:30:58,622 --> 00:31:01,022
And he told me
to give you a message.

444
00:31:01,758 --> 00:31:02,758
Me?

445
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,946
Why didn't you tell me this before?

446
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,617
You've seen so much.

447
00:31:10,207 --> 00:31:11,207
I just...

448
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,456
I just wanted to see you smile.

449
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:18,924
What was the message?

450
00:32:12,033 --> 00:32:14,549
If I hand you a gun
and you see a dead person,

451
00:32:14,674 --> 00:32:16,892
I don't care if it's your friend,
your neighbor

452
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,060
or your wife,

453
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,552
you shoot for the head.
That's the only way we survive.

454
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,149
Who the hell are you?

455
00:32:24,552 --> 00:32:26,694
- Friend of Bobby Singer's.
- Town drunk.

456
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:30,631
I thought...

457
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,368
- He was.
- Who told you that?

458
00:32:36,466 --> 00:32:37,616
Bobby Singer.

459
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:41,083
Stay sharp.

460
00:32:41,948 --> 00:32:43,748
I'll watch the front door.

461
00:32:54,586 --> 00:32:56,917
You know,
if you want to sit this one out...

462
00:32:59,797 --> 00:33:01,145
Let's just get going.

463
00:35:02,688 --> 00:35:04,038
Little help here?

464
00:35:32,572 --> 00:35:34,922
- Got any more ammo? I'm low.
- We got plenty.

465
00:35:35,047 --> 00:35:37,384
Just run back past the zombies.
It's in the van.

466
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,095
A simple "no" would have been fine.
What are they doing here?

467
00:35:40,804 --> 00:35:42,704
- I think I get it.
- What?

468
00:35:44,485 --> 00:35:45,785
That ain't good.

469
00:35:53,279 --> 00:35:54,443
- I'm out.
- Me too.

470
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,760
Kind of a tight fit,
don't you think?

471
00:36:23,885 --> 00:36:26,225
It's all right, they're idiots.
They can't pick a lock.

472
00:36:36,701 --> 00:36:38,753
Don't you ever get tired
of being wrong?

473
00:36:38,878 --> 00:36:41,073
I'm making this stuff up as I go.
Sue me.

474
00:36:53,529 --> 00:36:54,529
Get down!

475
00:37:27,715 --> 00:37:28,865
Are you okay?

476
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,499


477
00:37:50,345 --> 00:37:53,106
If there's any zombies left out there,
we can't find 'em.

478
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:57,608
- How are the townspeople?
- Pretty freaked out.

479
00:37:58,308 --> 00:37:59,708
Hell, traumatized.

480
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:02,893
A few of them
are calling the papers.

481
00:38:03,018 --> 00:38:04,698
Nobody's believed 'em yet.

482
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:07,326
Would you?

483
00:38:09,822 --> 00:38:11,472
How are you holding up?

484
00:38:23,256 --> 00:38:24,593
Is that everyone?

485
00:38:27,308 --> 00:38:28,408
All but one.

486
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,650
Thinking maybe I should apologize
for losing my head back there.

487
00:38:59,184 --> 00:39:00,817
You don't owe us anything.

488
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:03,850
Look, I don't know squat from Shinola
about love, but...

489
00:39:05,379 --> 00:39:08,096
At least you got to spend
five days with her, right?

490
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,860
Right.

491
00:39:11,965 --> 00:39:15,602
Which makes things
about a thousand times worse.

492
00:39:19,177 --> 00:39:21,077
She was the love of my life.

493
00:39:21,382 --> 00:39:23,632
How many times do I gotta kill her?

494
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,100
Gonna be okay, Bobby?

495
00:39:37,282 --> 00:39:38,625
You boys should know...

496
00:39:40,761 --> 00:39:42,911
Karen told me why Death was here.

497
00:39:43,642 --> 00:39:44,642
What?

498
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:47,421
I know why he took a stroll
through a cemetery

499
00:39:47,546 --> 00:39:49,546
in the sticks of South Dakota.

500
00:39:51,323 --> 00:39:52,573
He came for me.

501
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,710
- What do you mean, you?
- Death came for me.

502
00:39:57,941 --> 00:40:00,641
He brought Karen back
to send me a message.

503
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:06,183
- You? Why you?
- Because I've been helping you.

504
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:09,598
I'm one of the reasons
you're still saying no to Lucifer, Sam.

505
00:40:12,688 --> 00:40:14,077
This was a hit on your life?

506
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,505
I don't know
if they wanted to take my life or...

507
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:18,382
My spirit.

508
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:22,127
Either way,
they wanted me out of the way.

509
00:40:24,584 --> 00:40:26,077
But you're gonna be all right.

510
00:40:27,848 --> 00:40:28,998
Right, Bobby?
