1
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:04,962
Sam starring as Lucifer.
Dean starring as Michael.

2
00:00:06,087 --> 00:00:08,799
You're gonna suck it up,
accept your responsibilities,

3
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,730
and play the roles
that destiny has chosen for you.

4
00:00:12,052 --> 00:00:14,263
- Why didn't the stake kill you?
- I am the trickster.

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,744
But maybe you're not.

6
00:00:17,656 --> 00:00:19,477
- Hello, Gabriel.
- The archangel?

7
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,647
This isn't about some prizefight
between your brothers.

8
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:26,484
This is about you being too afraid
to stand up to your family!

9
00:00:26,923 --> 00:00:28,863
- Are you gonna do something stupid?
- Like what?

10
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:30,511
Michael stupid.
Come on, Sam.

11
00:00:30,636 --> 00:00:33,250
Things are about to get really bad.
The people that I'm gonna see next,

12
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:36,160
they're not gonna get anything from me
without agreeing to a few conditions.

13
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:38,996
Whatever you're thinking of doing,
don't do it. - I have to.

14
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,545
You're finally ready?
You know there's no other choice.

15
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,833
- There's never been a choice.
- The answer is yes.

16
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:44,779
Dean.

17
00:00:47,782 --> 00:00:49,527
Of course, I have a few conditions.

18
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:53,057
What changed your mind?
The damnedest thing.

19
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:55,726
I mean, the world's ending,
the walls are coming down on us.

20
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:58,429
I just didn't want to let you down.
So screw destiny.

21
00:00:58,554 --> 00:01:00,622
I say we take the fight to them,
do it our way.

22
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:40,726
Hello?

23
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:07,074
Hello?

24
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:32,760
Hiya.

25
00:02:33,836 --> 00:02:35,960
- Buddy, you can't be here.
- 'course I can.

26
00:02:36,085 --> 00:02:37,907
Someone's got to
get everything ready.

27
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:40,712
They're coming... All of them.

28
00:02:42,337 --> 00:02:44,402
And we've each got our part to play.

29
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:46,707
- Even you.
- What?

30
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,857
You're dinner.

31
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:54,993
= 519 =

32
00:02:56,688 --> 00:02:59,178
= Supernatural Team =

33
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:25,967
Nice digs, for once.

34
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,259
- Busy night.
- Any port in a storm, I guess.

35
00:03:39,348 --> 00:03:41,512
If you could just fill this out,
please.

36
00:03:44,754 --> 00:03:47,560
Sir, I think you got a little...
Shaving Nick there.

37
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,760
- Your key.
- Oh. Thanks.

38
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:00,223
You wouldn't happen to have
a coffee shop?

39
00:04:00,348 --> 00:04:02,947
Buffet.
All you can eat.

40
00:04:03,652 --> 00:04:05,873
Best pie in the tri-state area.

41
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:08,509
You don't say?

42
00:04:13,842 --> 00:04:15,402
Heaven, right?

43
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:19,230
Trust me, pal... better.

44
00:04:32,818 --> 00:04:34,773
- How you doing?
- No.

45
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:37,662
- But...
- No.

46
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:41,576
- Lady, I'm just, you know...
- I understand.

47
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:43,811
And no.

48
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,225
10-4. Yeah.

49
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,216
Unpucker, man. Eat something.

50
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:00,930
We should hit the road, Dean.

51
00:05:01,128 --> 00:05:03,975
- In this storm? What? It's...
- It's biblical. Exactly.

52
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,144
It's friggin' Noah's ark out there,
and we're eating pie.

53
00:05:08,464 --> 00:05:10,317
How many hours of sleep
did you get this week?

54
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:11,600
What? Three? Four?

55
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:14,447
Bobby's got his feelers out.

56
00:05:14,572 --> 00:05:17,775
We have talked with every hoodoo man
and root woman in 12 States.

57
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,881
- I'm not giving up.
- Nobody's giving up.

58
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:23,830
Especially me.

59
00:05:26,364 --> 00:05:28,299
We're gonna find a way
to beat the devil, okay?

60
00:05:28,424 --> 00:05:29,533
Soon. I can feel it.

61
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:33,332
And we will find Cass, we'll find Adam.
But you are no good to me burnt out.

62
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:40,878
Yeah, okay.

63
00:05:41,003 --> 00:05:43,008
Come on. We've actually
got the night off for once.

64
00:05:43,488 --> 00:05:45,133
Let's try to enjoy it.

65
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:09,974
What are you, 12?

66
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:11,265
I'm young at heart.

67
00:06:16,347 --> 00:06:19,783
Look at this.
We're like rockefellers.

68
00:06:20,143 --> 00:06:21,547
Chocolates!

69
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:26,849
You want yours?
Knock yourself out.

70
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,790
"Casa erotica 13" on demand.

71
00:06:35,537 --> 00:06:38,098
- What?
- Isn't this place kind of...

72
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,188
In the middle of nowhere?

73
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:41,692
So?

74
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:45,564
So what's a four-star hotel
doing on a no-star highway?

75
00:07:02,662 --> 00:07:03,416
Hello?

76
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,473
Hello?

77
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:35,013
The room next to ours...
The couple that are joined at the lips.

78
00:07:35,138 --> 00:07:36,200
Have you seen them?

79
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:39,353
Mr. And Mrs. Logan...
the honeymooners?

80
00:07:41,101 --> 00:07:42,301
They checked out.

81
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:45,221
- Is something the matter?
- They checked out?

82
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:46,904
Just now.

83
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,138
Really?

84
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:50,324
It sort of seemed like they were...

85
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,006
... In the middle of something.

86
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:56,055
It's kind of weird for honeymooners
to check out without this.

87
00:07:56,315 --> 00:07:57,503
Oh, dear.

88
00:07:57,863 --> 00:07:59,770
I'll just put that
right in the lost and found.

89
00:08:00,195 --> 00:08:01,469
Don't you worry.

90
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:03,440
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

91
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:05,660
No, we're good.

92
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,569
Super-fantastic.

93
00:08:12,295 --> 00:08:14,714
- Creepy.
- Broke the needle.

94
00:08:16,483 --> 00:08:18,275
All right, I'll scope out the joint,

95
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,581
And you keep an eye
on Norman bates over here.

96
00:08:21,122 --> 00:08:23,197
I mean, one night off.
Is that too much to ask?

97
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:15,025
This ain't no peep show, man!

98
00:09:23,592 --> 00:09:24,842
You're beautiful.

99
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:27,044
You're sweet.

100
00:09:28,764 --> 00:09:32,759
- I hate sweet.
- Sorry to interrupt.

101
00:09:33,378 --> 00:09:35,164
The last guest just arrived.

102
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:37,242
- So everything's ready?
- As it will ever be.

103
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,990
- Pantry's full.
- And the Winchesters?

104
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:43,665
Suspicious, but under control.

105
00:09:44,022 --> 00:09:46,330
- You have their blood?
- Of course I do.

106
00:09:46,862 --> 00:09:47,669
I'm quick.

107
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,995
Boys never even knew what hit them.

108
00:09:53,947 --> 00:09:55,259
Thank you, Mercury.

109
00:09:55,692 --> 00:09:58,513
Let's get this show on the road.

110
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,029
An elephant?
Like, an elephant?

111
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:07,284
- Like, full-on babar.
- So what the hell...

112
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,903
Where is everybody?

113
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,882
Let me guess... it's locked.

114
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,455
So, what? The roaches check in,
they don't check out?

115
00:10:24,346 --> 00:10:25,863
Think about how we got here.

116
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,008
That detour on I-90?

117
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:30,321
The friggin' hurricane?

118
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,300
- You saying we were led here?
- Like rats in a maze.

119
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,292
Please be tomato soup.
Please be tomato soup.

120
00:11:09,932 --> 00:11:11,392
Motel hell.

121
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:26,868
Help us!
Get us out!

122
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,197
- Hurry up!
- I'm going as fast as I...

123
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:37,029
There's somebody behind me,
isn't there?

124
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:10,640
Something tells me this isn't
a shriner convention.

125
00:12:15,663 --> 00:12:18,254
Dinner is served.

126
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,203
Ladies and gentlemen...

127
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,865
Our guests of honor have arrived.

128
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:34,836


129
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,274
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for coming.

130
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:41,444
Well, in all my centuries,
I never thought I'd see this...

131
00:12:41,997 --> 00:12:44,825
- This many gods under one roof.
- Gods?

132
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,516
Now, before we get down to brass tacks,
some ground rules...

133
00:12:47,944 --> 00:12:50,203
No slaughtering each other.

134
00:12:50,797 --> 00:12:51,852
Curb your wrath.

135
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,729
And keep your hands
off the local virgins.

136
00:12:54,854 --> 00:12:57,150
We're trying to keep
a low profile here.

137
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:58,801
We are so screwed.

138
00:12:58,926 --> 00:13:00,867
Now, we all know why we're here.

139
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:04,958
The judeo-christian apocalypse
looms over us.

140
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,849
I know we've all had our little
disagreements in the past,

141
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:13,463
but the time has come to put those aside
and look toward the future.

142
00:13:13,797 --> 00:13:16,210
'cause if we don't,
we won't have one.

143
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:20,966
Now, we do have two very
valuable bargaining chips...

144
00:13:21,276 --> 00:13:23,969
Michael and Lucifer's vessels.

145
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,675
The question is...

146
00:13:26,447 --> 00:13:27,889
What do we do now?

147
00:13:28,337 --> 00:13:30,392
Anybody have any bright ideas,
speak up.

148
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:32,704
This is a safe room.

149
00:13:34,153 --> 00:13:36,481
What do we do?
We kill them.

150
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,250
- I don't like his tone.
- Kill them? Why?

151
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,276
So the angels here
can bring them back again?

152
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:43,947
I don't know what everybody's
getting so worked up about.

153
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:46,929
This is just a couple of angels
having a slap fight.

154
00:13:47,268 --> 00:13:48,878
It's no armageddon.

155
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:51,514
Everybody knows
when the world comes to an end,

156
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:54,040
the great serpent
Jormungandr rises up,

157
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:58,282
and I, myself, will be eaten
by a big wolf.

158
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,274
Here we go...

159
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,133
Oh, yeah?
And why is that?

160
00:14:03,664 --> 00:14:06,386
Your beliefs are
so much more realistic?

161
00:14:06,986 --> 00:14:10,982
The whole world's getting carried around
on the back of a giant turtle.

162
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,058
Give me a break.

163
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,978
Don't mock my world turtle.

164
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,315
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Im gonna send you packing to Valhalla!

165
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,368
You watch your mouth
when you talk to me, boy!

166
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,110
Boy? I'm older than you.

167
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,945
No one's ever proved that.

168
00:14:26,723 --> 00:14:27,935
Stay.

169
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:38,486
We have to fight.

170
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:42,583
The archangels...
The only thing they understand

171
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,290
is violence.

172
00:14:45,293 --> 00:14:48,304
This ends in blood.
There is no other way.

173
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,059
It's them... Or us.

174
00:14:52,962 --> 00:14:56,960
With all due respect...
Ma'am...

175
00:14:57,657 --> 00:14:59,855
We haven't even tried
talking to them.

176
00:15:14,355 --> 00:15:15,204
Kali.

177
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,374
Who asked you?

178
00:15:21,124 --> 00:15:23,922
Can't we all just get along?

179
00:15:24,377 --> 00:15:25,299
Gab...

180
00:15:27,402 --> 00:15:29,553
Sam. Dean.

181
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,216
It's always wrong place, worst time

182
00:15:33,341 --> 00:15:34,706
With you muttonheads, huh?

183
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:35,783
Loki.

184
00:15:37,887 --> 00:15:38,753
Baldur.

185
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:41,227
Good seeing you, too.

186
00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:43,887
I guess my invitation
got lost in the mail.

187
00:15:44,183 --> 00:15:45,443
Why are you here?

188
00:15:45,717 --> 00:15:47,526
To talk about
the elephant in the room.

189
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:48,904
Not you.

190
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,825
The apocalypse.

191
00:15:52,697 --> 00:15:54,785
We can't stop it, gang.

192
00:15:58,091 --> 00:15:59,662
But first things first.

193
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,966
The adults need to have
a little conversation.

194
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,963
Check you later.

195
00:16:10,265 --> 00:16:12,889
- Okay.
- Did that...

196
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,028
- Holy crap.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

197
00:16:15,263 --> 00:16:17,514
By the way, next time I say
"let's keep driving",

198
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,974
- Let's keep driving.
- Okay, next time.

199
00:16:21,432 --> 00:16:23,522
All right, so, what's our next move?

200
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:26,293
I don't know.

201
00:16:26,937 --> 00:16:29,029
We grab those poor saps
out of the freezer, I guess...

202
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,098
Bust them out.

203
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,243
Gank a few freaks along the way
if we're lucky.

204
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:34,246
And when are you ever lucky?

205
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:37,245
You know what?
Bite me, Gabriel.

206
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,497
- Maybe later, big boy.
- I should have known.

207
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,750
I mean, this had your stink
all over it from the jump.

208
00:16:42,493 --> 00:16:44,524
You think I'm behind this?

209
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:45,955
Please.

210
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:49,659
I'm the costner to your Houston.
I'm here to save your ass.

211
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,093
- You want to pull us out of the fire?
- Bingo.

212
00:16:53,153 --> 00:16:55,388
Those gods are either gonna
dust you or use you as bait.

213
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,477
Either way, you're uber-boned.

214
00:16:57,602 --> 00:16:59,035
'cause a couple of months ago,

215
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,517
you were telling us
that we need to play our roles.

216
00:17:01,863 --> 00:17:03,539
You were uber-boning us.

217
00:17:04,616 --> 00:17:06,101
The end is still nigh.

218
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:09,676
Michael and Lucifer
are gonna dance the lambada.

219
00:17:09,979 --> 00:17:12,530
But not tonight.
Not here.

220
00:17:14,342 --> 00:17:15,574
And why do you care?

221
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,369
I don't care.

222
00:17:19,945 --> 00:17:20,823
But...

223
00:17:21,677 --> 00:17:24,926
Me and kali, we had a thing.

224
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:27,672
Chick was all hands.

225
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,965
What can I say?
I'm sentimental.

226
00:17:31,432 --> 00:17:32,718
Do they have a chance?

227
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:34,969
- Against Satan?
- Really, Sam?

228
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,039
You got a better idea, Dean?

229
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,766
It's a bad idea.

230
00:17:40,678 --> 00:17:43,078
Lucifer's gonna turn them
into finger paint.

231
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:45,454
So let's get going
while the going's good.

232
00:17:45,579 --> 00:17:47,483
Why don't you just
zap us out of here, then?

233
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,751
Would if I could.

234
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:51,611
But Kali's got you
by the short and curlies.

235
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,748
It's a blood spell.

236
00:17:54,701 --> 00:17:56,790
- You boys are on a leash.
- What does that mean?

237
00:17:56,915 --> 00:18:00,367
Means it's time for a little
of the old black magic.

238
00:18:02,345 --> 00:18:04,367
Okay. Whatever.
We're gonna take the hors d'oeuvres

239
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:06,700
- in the freezer with us.
- Forget it.

240
00:18:06,825 --> 00:18:09,038
It's gonna be hard enough
sneaking you mooks out of here.

241
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:10,621
They called you "Loki", right?

242
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,049
Which mean they don't
really know who you are.

243
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,877
Told you...
I'm in Witness Protection.

244
00:18:15,002 --> 00:18:17,438
Then how about you do what we say,

245
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:21,537
or we tell the legion of doom
about your secret identity?

246
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,642
They don't seem like
a real pro-angel kind of crowd.

247
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:26,040
I'll take your voices away.

248
00:18:26,165 --> 00:18:28,098
- We'll write it down.
- I'll cut off your hands.

249
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,624
Then people are gonna be asking,
"why are you guys running around

250
00:18:30,749 --> 00:18:31,809
with no hands?"

251
00:18:35,223 --> 00:18:36,309
Fine.

252
00:18:49,536 --> 00:18:50,920
Bonjour, mon amour.

253
00:18:52,136 --> 00:18:53,095
Leave.

254
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,882
You always did play hard to get.

255
00:18:55,587 --> 00:18:57,719
- I've moved on.
- I noticed.

256
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,864
Baldur? Really?

257
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:06,686
Baldur's uncomplicated.

258
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:20,953
It's too late.

259
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,138
I never took you for the type.

260
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:30,375
- Romantic?
- Pathetic.

261
00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:33,589
You're the one who called me here.

262
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:36,899
Because I thought
you might take this seriously.

263
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:39,948
I'm taking this seriously.

264
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,639
Ship's sinking. Time to get off.

265
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:46,059
I mean, screw this marble.
Let's go check out pandora.

266
00:19:47,015 --> 00:19:48,769
It doesn't have to be like that.

267
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:53,316
Afraid it does.

268
00:19:54,852 --> 00:19:56,634
- If we fight...
- You die.

269
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:58,287
And what makes you such an expert?

270
00:19:58,412 --> 00:20:01,199
I've tussled with those winged
ass-monkeys once or twice.

271
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:04,471
Kali...
No more tricks.

272
00:20:04,926 --> 00:20:07,497
I'm begging you... don't do this.

273
00:20:08,725 --> 00:20:10,081
I have to.

274
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,576
Can't blame me for trying.

275
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,010
Still love me?

276
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:22,662
No.

277
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:52,876
Where is Gabriel?

278
00:20:53,665 --> 00:20:55,565
You must take me for a fool.

279
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,380
Gabriel.

280
00:20:58,471 --> 00:20:59,549
You're bound to me.

281
00:21:00,262 --> 00:21:01,885
Now and forever.

282
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,605
We face the ghosts
when the others will not

283
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,065
we're the ghost, ghostfacers

284
00:21:17,037 --> 00:21:19,444
They leave the kitchen
when the kitchen gets hot

285
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:23,986
Is the intern position open?

286
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,825
- You're hired!
- Really?

287
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,160
See my face
right in your little box?

288
00:21:28,472 --> 00:21:30,496
My face has got to be
right in your box.

289
00:21:40,235 --> 00:21:41,382
If you're dead,

290
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,100
you better stay dead.

291
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:45,428
Cause if not, we're gonna kill you.

292
00:21:46,214 --> 00:21:47,214


293
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,685
- How long have you known?
- Long enough.

294
00:21:55,346 --> 00:21:56,996
How's the rescue going?

295
00:21:57,368 --> 00:21:58,368
Well,

296
00:21:58,493 --> 00:21:59,943
surprise, surprise.

297
00:22:01,812 --> 00:22:04,697
- The trickster has tricked us.
- Kali... don't.

298
00:22:05,012 --> 00:22:06,115
You're mine now.

299
00:22:10,431 --> 00:22:12,713
&And you have something I want.

300
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,500
An archangel's blade.

301
00:22:28,804 --> 00:22:30,354
From the archangel...

302
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:32,019
Gabriel.

303
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:40,775
So I got wings.

304
00:22:41,131 --> 00:22:42,181
Like Kotex.

305
00:22:42,712 --> 00:22:44,988
But that doesn't make me
any less right about Lucifer.

306
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:46,206
He's lying.

307
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:48,801
- He's a spy.
- I'm not a spy.

308
00:22:49,462 --> 00:22:50,662
I'm a runaway.

309
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,437
I'm trying to save you.

310
00:22:53,988 --> 00:22:55,688
I know my brother, Kali.

311
00:22:56,795 --> 00:22:59,134
He should scare
the living crap out of you.

312
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:01,572
You can't beat him.

313
00:23:02,077 --> 00:23:03,366
I've skipped ahead.

314
00:23:03,491 --> 00:23:04,799
Seen how this story ends.

315
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,017
Your story.

316
00:23:06,815 --> 00:23:07,815
Not ours.

317
00:23:09,219 --> 00:23:10,516
Westerners... I swear,

318
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:12,765
the sheer arrogance.

319
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,768
You think
you're the only ones on earth?

320
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:19,113
You pillage and you butcher
in your God's name.

321
00:23:19,994 --> 00:23:21,691
But you're not the only religion.

322
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,201
And he's not the only god.

323
00:23:25,188 --> 00:23:28,338
And now you think
you can just rip the planet apart?

324
00:23:28,893 --> 00:23:30,043
You're wrong.

325
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:33,565
There are billions of us.

326
00:23:34,815 --> 00:23:36,330
And we were here first.

327
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,332
If anyone gets to end this world,

328
00:23:42,094 --> 00:23:43,094
it's me.

329
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,260
I'm sorry.

330
00:24:12,566 --> 00:24:13,766
This is crazy.

331
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:15,675
They can die.

332
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:21,829
We can kill Lucifer.

333
00:24:24,846 --> 00:24:27,456
All right, you primitive screwheads,
listen up.

334
00:24:27,581 --> 00:24:29,842
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm out of options.

335
00:24:31,913 --> 00:24:35,163
Now, on any other given day,
I'd be doing my damnedest

336
00:24:35,414 --> 00:24:38,101
to kill you,
you filthy, murdering chimps.

337
00:24:40,085 --> 00:24:41,085
But...

338
00:24:42,969 --> 00:24:44,269
Desperate times.

339
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:49,270
So even though I'd love nothing better
than to slit your throats,

340
00:24:49,395 --> 00:24:50,655
you dicks...

341
00:24:54,668 --> 00:24:55,993
I'm gonna help you.

342
00:24:56,792 --> 00:24:58,657
I'm gonna help you ice the devil.

343
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:04,377
And then we can all get back
to ganking each other.

344
00:25:06,106 --> 00:25:07,421
You want Lucifer?

345
00:25:08,351 --> 00:25:09,799
Dude's not in the yellow pages.

346
00:25:10,898 --> 00:25:12,802
But me and Sam, we can get him here.

347
00:25:13,477 --> 00:25:16,327
- How?
- First, you let those main courses go.

348
00:25:17,447 --> 00:25:18,597
Then we talk.

349
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:21,976
We can either
take on the devil together

350
00:25:22,389 --> 00:25:24,313
or you lame-ass bitches can eat me.

351
00:25:27,663 --> 00:25:28,663
Literally.

352
00:25:29,793 --> 00:25:31,743
Come on, everybody! Let's go!

353
00:25:35,817 --> 00:25:37,117
Get out of here!

354
00:25:41,526 --> 00:25:42,876
Don't look at me!

355
00:25:44,107 --> 00:25:45,207
Act natural.

356
00:25:45,633 --> 00:25:46,633
Get in.

357
00:25:53,406 --> 00:25:55,107
There is nothing natural about this.

358
00:25:55,232 --> 00:25:57,983
- I thought you were dead.
- You think I'd give Kali my real sword?

359
00:25:58,108 --> 00:25:59,570
That thing can kill me.

360
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:02,669
- Then what do they have in there?
- A fake.

361
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,979
Made it out of a can
of diet orange slice.

362
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:08,316
So...

363
00:26:09,906 --> 00:26:11,806
Go snag our blood, would ya?

364
00:26:12,244 --> 00:26:14,087
- What?
- I heard you in there.

365
00:26:14,446 --> 00:26:16,449
Kali likes you. You can get close.

366
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,659
Lift the plasma, then we vamoose.

367
00:26:21,651 --> 00:26:23,203
Hand over the real blade.

368
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:26,154
Better yet, why don't you sack up
and help us take down Lucifer?

369
00:26:27,677 --> 00:26:29,170
- You can't be serious.
- Deadly.

370
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,746
Since when are you butt-buddies
with a bunch of monsters?

371
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,972
That's all they are to you,
aren't they?

372
00:26:34,097 --> 00:26:37,183
Sam was right. It's nuts.
But it's the best idea I've heard.

373
00:26:37,308 --> 00:26:39,048
So unless you have a better one...

374
00:26:41,168 --> 00:26:42,504
Good luck with that.

375
00:26:42,629 --> 00:26:44,429
Me, I'm blowing Jonestown.

376
00:26:44,692 --> 00:26:46,864
They wanna run off a cliff,
that's their business.

377
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:49,404
I see right through you.
The smart-ass shell, the whole

378
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:50,983
"I could give a crap" thing.

379
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,860
Believe me,
it takes one to know one.

380
00:26:53,252 --> 00:26:54,252
That so?

381
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:57,087
Maybe those freaks aren't your blood,
but they are your family.

382
00:26:57,212 --> 00:26:59,087
They just stabbed me
in the friggin' heart!

383
00:26:59,212 --> 00:27:01,347
But you still give a crap about them,
don't you?

384
00:27:02,975 --> 00:27:05,059
They're gonna die in there
without you.

385
00:27:07,956 --> 00:27:09,656
I can't kill my brother.

386
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:13,847
Can't or won't?

387
00:27:17,238 --> 00:27:18,838
That's what I thought.

388
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,935
So, you're going to summon Lucifer?

389
00:27:27,352 --> 00:27:28,352
Sort of.

390
00:27:28,477 --> 00:27:31,117
I just need you to squeegee some stuff
from my ribs,

391
00:27:31,242 --> 00:27:32,566
and he'll come running.

392
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:34,918
Breaking them would be easier.

393
00:27:38,582 --> 00:27:39,682
Show's over.

394
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:42,179
Sword's a fake.

395
00:27:42,448 --> 00:27:44,548
And Gabriel, he's still kicking.

396
00:27:45,236 --> 00:27:48,040
I hate to break it to you, sister,
but you've been tricked.

397
00:27:53,885 --> 00:27:54,985
Checking in.

398
00:27:59,853 --> 00:28:00,853


399
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:03,278
Lucifer.

400
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:06,309
- Thanks for coming.
- You did right calling me.

401
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:08,901
It's just...

402
00:28:10,005 --> 00:28:12,805
The way the talk is heading in there,
it's...

403
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,208
It's insane.

404
00:28:16,447 --> 00:28:19,682
You know,
I never understood you pagans.

405
00:28:19,807 --> 00:28:21,007
You're such...

406
00:28:21,386 --> 00:28:22,700
Petty little things.

407
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,080
Always fighting...

408
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:27,330
Always happy
to sell out your own kind.

409
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:30,916
No wonder
you forfeited this planet to us.

410
00:28:33,075 --> 00:28:34,075
You...

411
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:36,088
Are worse than humans.

412
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,799
You're worse than demons.

413
00:28:39,074 --> 00:28:41,024
And yet you claim to be gods.

414
00:28:52,411 --> 00:28:54,211
And they call me prideful.

415
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,879
What's happening?

416
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,603
It's him.

417
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:34,648
How?

418
00:29:35,018 --> 00:29:37,519
Does it matter?
Shazam us out of here, would you?

419
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:38,759
We can't.

420
00:29:42,557 --> 00:29:43,906
Of course you can't.

421
00:29:45,629 --> 00:29:47,284
You didn't say "mother, may I?".

422
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,371
Good to see you again.

423
00:29:50,728 --> 00:29:52,545
Baldur... Don't.

424
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,458
You think you own the planet?

425
00:29:56,137 --> 00:29:57,887
What gives you the right?

426
00:30:00,364 --> 00:30:01,715
No one gives us the right.

427
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,310
We take it.

428
00:30:31,723 --> 00:30:32,873
Are you okay?

429
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,039
Not really.

430
00:30:35,812 --> 00:30:37,462
Better late than never.

431
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,629
Guard this with your life.

432
00:30:54,963 --> 00:30:55,963
Lucy.

433
00:30:56,686 --> 00:30:57,686
I'm home.

434
00:31:01,428 --> 00:31:02,443
Not this time.

435
00:31:10,054 --> 00:31:11,054
Guys!

436
00:31:11,983 --> 00:31:13,483
Get her out of here.

437
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,560
Over a girl.

438
00:31:18,301 --> 00:31:19,933
Gabriel, really?

439
00:31:20,305 --> 00:31:22,405
I knew you were slumming, but...

440
00:31:23,162 --> 00:31:24,924
I hope you didn't catch anything.

441
00:31:27,167 --> 00:31:28,167
Lucifer...

442
00:31:28,479 --> 00:31:30,429
You're my brother, and I love you.

443
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:34,642
But you are
a great big bag of dicks.

444
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,685
What did you just say to me?

445
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,203
Look at yourself.

446
00:31:40,128 --> 00:31:42,525
"Daddy was mean to me,
so I'm gonna smash up all his toys."

447
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:45,194
- Watch your tone.
- Play the victim all you want.

448
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:46,712
But you and me...

449
00:31:47,498 --> 00:31:48,898
We know the truth.

450
00:31:50,939 --> 00:31:52,389
Dad loved you best.

451
00:31:52,997 --> 00:31:54,397
More than Michael.

452
00:31:55,257 --> 00:31:56,407
More than me.

453
00:31:57,244 --> 00:31:58,970
Then he brought the new baby home,

454
00:31:59,095 --> 00:32:00,945
and you couldn't handle it.

455
00:32:01,273 --> 00:32:04,445
So all this
is just a great big temper tantrum.

456
00:32:08,783 --> 00:32:10,083
Time to grow up.

457
00:32:12,338 --> 00:32:14,765
- I'm not getting in that thing.
- Get in the car.

458
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:24,525
- If you're doing this for Michael...
- Screw him.

459
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,735
If he were standing here,
I'd shiv his ass, too.

460
00:32:28,466 --> 00:32:30,716
- You disloyal...
- Oh, I'm loyal.

461
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:33,958
- To them.
- Who?

462
00:32:34,641 --> 00:32:37,413
These... so-called gods?

463
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:39,081
To people, Lucifer.

464
00:32:40,807 --> 00:32:42,957
People. So you're willing to die

465
00:32:43,567 --> 00:32:45,617
for a pile of cockroaches? Why?

466
00:32:46,263 --> 00:32:47,756
Because Dad was right.

467
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:53,070
- They are better than us.
- They are broken, flawed abortions.

468
00:32:53,195 --> 00:32:54,680
Damn right they're flawed.

469
00:32:56,561 --> 00:32:57,891
But a lot of them try.

470
00:32:58,786 --> 00:32:59,936
To do better.

471
00:33:00,388 --> 00:33:01,438
To forgive.

472
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,566
And you should see
the spearmint rhino.

473
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:10,539
I've been riding the pine
a long time,

474
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,323
but I'm in the game now.

475
00:33:13,443 --> 00:33:15,893
And I'm not on your side
or Michael's.

476
00:33:18,902 --> 00:33:20,102
I'm on theirs.

477
00:33:23,729 --> 00:33:25,779
Brother, don't make me do this.

478
00:33:26,543 --> 00:33:28,380
No one makes us do anything.

479
00:33:30,662 --> 00:33:33,218
I know you think
you're doing the right thing, Gabriel.

480
00:33:33,605 --> 00:33:35,262
But I know where your heart

481
00:33:35,531 --> 00:33:36,581
truly lies.

482
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,260
Here.

483
00:33:51,268 --> 00:33:52,768
Amateur hocus-pocus.

484
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,165
Don't forget...

485
00:33:55,786 --> 00:33:58,936
You learned all your tricks from me,
little brother.

486
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:25,659


487
00:34:28,315 --> 00:34:32,215


488
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,018


489
00:34:40,601 --> 00:34:41,751
Dear diary...

490
00:34:42,071 --> 00:34:45,221
Being a high-powered
business president is super-fun

491
00:34:45,346 --> 00:34:47,070
but so exhausting.

492
00:34:47,343 --> 00:34:49,393
Sometimes I just need to relax.

493
00:34:49,894 --> 00:34:52,190
I need casa erotica.

494
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,367
Room service.

495
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,240
Come in!

496
00:34:58,037 --> 00:35:00,585
Gabriel wanted you to guard this
with your life?

497
00:35:01,383 --> 00:35:03,683
Maybe he's a fan. It is a good one.

498
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,188
I've got the kielbasa you ordered.

499
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:10,774
Polish?

500
00:35:11,301 --> 00:35:12,301
Hungarian.

501
00:35:22,065 --> 00:35:23,245
What's going on?

502
00:35:27,674 --> 00:35:30,324
You're probably wondering
what's going on.

503
00:35:31,277 --> 00:35:32,277
Well...

504
00:35:33,238 --> 00:35:35,038
If you're watching this...

505
00:35:35,898 --> 00:35:36,898
I'm dead.

506
00:35:37,198 --> 00:35:38,248
Oh, please!

507
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:42,060
Stop sobbing.
It's embarrassing for all of us.

508
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,480
Without me, you've got

509
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,769
zero shot at killing Lucifer.

510
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,330
Sorry.

511
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:49,779
But...

512
00:35:50,603 --> 00:35:51,884
You can trap him.

513
00:35:52,009 --> 00:35:53,484
The cage you sprung Lucifer from,

514
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:55,258
it's still down there.

515
00:35:55,383 --> 00:35:57,432
And maybe... just maybe...

516
00:35:57,557 --> 00:35:59,448
You can shove his ass back in.

517
00:36:00,247 --> 00:36:01,784
Not that it'll be easy.

518
00:36:01,988 --> 00:36:04,912
You got to get the cage open,
trick my bro back into it,

519
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:06,279
and...

520
00:36:07,587 --> 00:36:09,687
Avoid Michael and the God squad.

521
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,826
But hey, details, right?

522
00:36:14,204 --> 00:36:15,905
And here's the big secret

523
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,230
Lucifer himself doesn't even know.

524
00:36:18,477 --> 00:36:19,968
But the key to the cage...

525
00:36:20,935 --> 00:36:22,185
It's out there.

526
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:23,806
Actually, it's keys.

527
00:36:24,218 --> 00:36:25,218
Plural.

528
00:36:25,694 --> 00:36:26,694
Four keys.

529
00:36:26,927 --> 00:36:28,277
Well, four rings.

530
00:36:29,365 --> 00:36:30,479
From the horsemen.

531
00:36:30,823 --> 00:36:33,073
You get them all, you got the cage.

532
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:35,811
Can't say I'm betting on you boys,

533
00:36:35,936 --> 00:36:38,403
but I've been wrong before.

534
00:36:39,886 --> 00:36:40,986
And, Dean...

535
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,699
You were right.

536
00:36:43,131 --> 00:36:45,631
I was afraid
to stand up to my brother.

537
00:36:46,644 --> 00:36:47,744
Not anymore.

538
00:36:49,048 --> 00:36:51,917
So this is me standing up.

539
00:36:52,512 --> 00:36:53,862
And this is me...

540
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,290
Lying down.

541
00:37:06,588 --> 00:37:07,588
Horsemen?

542
00:37:09,647 --> 00:37:10,727
We got War's.

543
00:37:14,729 --> 00:37:16,179
We nicked Famine's.

544
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,153
That's two rings down.
Collect all four.

545
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,073
- All we need is Pestilence and Death.
- Is that all?

546
00:37:24,489 --> 00:37:25,589
It's a plan.

547
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:20,380
What the hell?

548
00:38:29,256 --> 00:38:31,356
Does this stuff make you drowsy?

549
00:38:32,562 --> 00:38:34,000
I got a lot of driving to do.

550
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,925
Blue ones make you sleepy.

551
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:38,813
Red and orange ones
are okay for daytime.

552
00:38:46,706 --> 00:38:47,906
This is awful.
