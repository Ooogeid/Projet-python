1
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:15,865
Evening, barkeep.

2
00:00:16,389 --> 00:00:18,655
I would like to purchase
some alcohol, please.

3
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:20,351
What can I get you?

4
00:00:20,476 --> 00:00:23,144
Well, I'm 26, as you can see.

5
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,020
From my license.

6
00:00:25,824 --> 00:00:27,659
Congratulations.
What can I get you?

7
00:00:28,468 --> 00:00:30,154
A bana daiquiri, my good man.

8
00:00:33,304 --> 00:00:34,352
I'm Crystal.

9
00:00:34,949 --> 00:00:36,020
What's your name?

10
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:38,082
- Hi, Crystal.
- I'm Gary.

11
00:00:38,514 --> 00:00:41,332
Gary, I don't want to embarrass you,
but you are just...

12
00:00:41,816 --> 00:00:44,124
You are just a stunning-looking man.

13
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:46,159
I know, right?

14
00:00:50,045 --> 00:00:50,812
Thanks!

15
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:54,431
You having a good time tonight?

16
00:00:55,753 --> 00:00:59,047
Thank you for asking, Crystal.
This is, like, the best night ever.

17
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:03,743
Do you think we could
make it any better?

18
00:01:06,158 --> 00:01:07,858
Probably.
I don't know.

19
00:01:10,346 --> 00:01:12,571
I mean, do you want to get
out of here?

20
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:19,353
I kind of like this bar.
And I just ordered this daiquiri.

21
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:22,585
I mean...

22
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:25,167
Do you want to get
out of here with me?

23
00:01:32,228 --> 00:01:33,800
Are we talking about sex?

24
00:01:34,446 --> 00:01:35,993
Well, i, uh...

25
00:01:38,088 --> 00:01:40,220
Yeah.
I suppose we are.

26
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:45,711
Crystal, I would love to have
the sex with you.

27
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,077
Great.
Then let's go.

28
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,252
Love that jacket on you, by the way.

29
00:01:59,812 --> 00:02:02,322
Thanks.
Actually...

30
00:02:03,473 --> 00:02:04,915
The whole outfit is new.

31
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:08,613
= 512 =

32
00:02:09,557 --> 00:02:12,965
= Supernatural Team =

33
00:02:22,444 --> 00:02:24,477
Dean and Sammy Winchester!

34
00:02:25,372 --> 00:02:28,275
- So, how long has it been?
- The summer before 6th grade.

35
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:31,734
I remember. You assigned yourself
your own reading list.

36
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:33,944
That's right.
I forgot about that.

37
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:39,029
Your mom happens to be
the best babysitter we ever had.

38
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,002
When I was a maid at the mayflower,
out on the interstate...

39
00:02:43,127 --> 00:02:44,983
Long before you were even an idea...

40
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:49,274
Their daddy used to pass through town
and leave the boys with me while...

41
00:02:49,714 --> 00:02:51,751
He went off to... work.

42
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:54,982
One time, he was gone for two weeks.

43
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:56,050
Two weeks?

44
00:02:56,482 --> 00:02:58,435
He'd always come limping back.

45
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:00,554
He loved you boys.

46
00:03:02,431 --> 00:03:04,341
Did you know
what he did all that time?

47
00:03:04,844 --> 00:03:06,644
Little Sammy kept trying to tell me.

48
00:03:07,156 --> 00:03:08,691
Of course, I didn't believe him.

49
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,528
Not at first, anyway.

50
00:03:13,053 --> 00:03:14,673
Katie, our dad...

51
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,294
Happened to be an expert
at getting rid of ghosts.

52
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:19,448
And now, so are we.

53
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,326
That's why I called them, sweetie.
They can help us.

54
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:25,777
Sounds like you guys got
yourself a poltergeist.

55
00:03:25,902 --> 00:03:27,912
Started a month or two
after we moved in.

56
00:03:28,232 --> 00:03:32,236
First it was just bumps and knocks
and scratches on the walls.

57
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:35,108
And then it started breaking things.

58
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:36,583
And then it attacked Katie?

59
00:03:37,192 --> 00:03:38,467
That was two nights ago.

60
00:03:40,131 --> 00:03:41,378
Can you show them, honey?

61
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,018
"Murderd chylde."

62
00:03:53,328 --> 00:03:54,328
Katie...

63
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:56,539
Everything's gonna be fine.

64
00:03:57,187 --> 00:03:58,195
I promise.

65
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,100
Why don't you guys take
yourselves a little vacation

66
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:03,534
and we'll take care of it.

67
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:05,498
Thank you.

68
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,646
Bacon burger turbo,
large chili-cheese fry

69
00:04:16,065 --> 00:04:18,465
and a healthquake salad shake?

70
00:04:19,818 --> 00:04:22,931
I know. I know.
It's not mine.

71
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,116
Oh, you shake it up, baby.

72
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:49,387
Poltergeist aside, donna looked
pretty good, don't you think?

73
00:04:49,512 --> 00:04:52,052
Don't tell me you've still got the hots
for our babysitter.

74
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:53,542
What? No.

75
00:04:54,296 --> 00:04:55,211
That's weird.

76
00:04:56,603 --> 00:04:58,365
I'm just saying that she...

77
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,995
She's doing good.
You know, with her husband, her kid.

78
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,029
This whole amityville thing
being thrown at them

79
00:05:04,154 --> 00:05:05,430
and they're hanging tough.

80
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:11,593
You ever think that you'd want
something like that?

81
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:14,813
Wife, rugrats, the whole nine?

82
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,882
Not really my thing anymore.

83
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,395
What do you got?

84
00:05:26,056 --> 00:05:28,206
That house of theirs, it's old...

85
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,913
Really old.
Hundreds of years.

86
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:33,481
And I found a legend.
It's unconfirmed, but still...

87
00:05:33,606 --> 00:05:34,414
Saying?

88
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:38,204
Supposedly in the 1720s, house was owned
by a guy named Isaiah Pickett.

89
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:42,667
Legend has it he hung a woman
in his backyard for witchcraft...

90
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,430
A woman named Maggie Briggs.

91
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:47,888
- Okay, so an angry ghost witch?
- If it's true.

92
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:51,454
That still doesn't explain
what "murderd chylde" means.

93
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:53,229
Or where the bitch is buried.

94
00:05:54,032 --> 00:05:56,115
You know, it's a long way back,

95
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,844
but I can see if I can find something
in the town records.

96
00:05:59,562 --> 00:06:00,854
It's worth a shot.

97
00:06:03,809 --> 00:06:05,869
Gary!
Curly fries are up!

98
00:06:07,051 --> 00:06:09,052
- So, any luck?
- Bubkes.

99
00:06:09,341 --> 00:06:11,753
Can't even find proof a woman
named Maggie Briggs existed,

100
00:06:11,878 --> 00:06:13,876
much less where she was planted.

101
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:19,236
- We've got a minute to breathe here.
- Let's pick it up first thing.

102
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:21,303
You bet.
See you in a few.

103
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,547
What...

104
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:19,237
Who...

105
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:30,428
This is Collins out on route 30.
I think we got him.

106
00:07:31,013 --> 00:07:33,782
Mr. Frankel?
Mr. Gary Frankel?

107
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:35,375
Who?

108
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,279
Your family's worried sick
about you, son.

109
00:07:37,404 --> 00:07:38,389
My family?

110
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:41,293
My brother called you?

111
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,644
Come on.
Get in before you freeze solid.

112
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:15,481
Thanks...

113
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,747
But where are we?

114
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:19,988
You're home, son.

115
00:08:21,455 --> 00:08:23,485
No, officer, I'm not staying here.

116
00:08:24,715 --> 00:08:26,531
Gary! Oh, god! Gary!

117
00:08:28,561 --> 00:08:29,645
Are you all right?

118
00:08:31,564 --> 00:08:32,873
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

119
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:35,222
What's going on here?

120
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,125
- What do you mean?
- Lady, who are you?

121
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,744
Young man, are you drunk?

122
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,490
And who are you?

123
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,803
Gary, are you drunk?

124
00:08:43,212 --> 00:08:44,356
Answer your father.

125
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,292
My father?

126
00:08:48,426 --> 00:08:49,440
Look, I...

127
00:08:57,023 --> 00:08:57,995
Who is that?!

128
00:08:58,895 --> 00:09:01,373
- Who the hell is that?!
- He's out of his gourd.

129
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:03,554
Young man,
I'm very surprised at you.

130
00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:07,102
Tell me about it.

131
00:09:10,797 --> 00:09:12,288


132
00:09:18,706 --> 00:09:19,535
Bring it!

133
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,521
Holy crap.

134
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,947
Where the hell you been, man?
I've been trying to call you for hours.

135
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:34,647
I picked up some food.

136
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:39,369
Bacon burger turbo,
large chili-cheese fry, right?

137
00:09:44,956 --> 00:09:47,052
Sorry, man. Really.
I just...

138
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:49,504
I lost track of time.
I didn't mean to freak you out.

139
00:09:51,482 --> 00:09:52,339
Thanks.

140
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:54,968
Don't know why it took you
two hours but thanks.

141
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:58,100
You're gonna want to eat
that on the road.

142
00:09:58,225 --> 00:09:58,997
Why?

143
00:09:59,363 --> 00:10:03,367
The maid came in, saw that,
now they're all kind of freaking out.

144
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,815
Why'd you let the maid in?
It just happened.

145
00:10:11,204 --> 00:10:11,966
Whatever.

146
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:14,019
I got to hit the head
and then we'll take off.

147
00:10:14,497 --> 00:10:15,863
All right.
I'll be outside.

148
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:46,594
You ready?

149
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,225
Absolutely.

150
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,572
Can I drive?

151
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,503
This is so sweet!

152
00:11:08,442 --> 00:11:10,842
You want to get the lead out, Andretti?
Come on.

153
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:15,868
Reverse.
Reverse!

154
00:11:24,706 --> 00:11:26,129
It's in reverse.

155
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:29,609
I am really sorry.

156
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:32,904
Shut up.

157
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,713
This is Dean's other other cell,
so you must know what to do.

158
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:48,449
Dean, I've called
every phone we got.

159
00:11:52,308 --> 00:11:53,400
Where are you, man?

160
00:11:54,845 --> 00:11:55,753
So...

161
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,607
This is gonna sound crazy...

162
00:11:59,922 --> 00:12:01,540
Really crazy but...

163
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,495
I think I'm in the wrong body.

164
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:06,266
Could use a little help here.

165
00:12:12,012 --> 00:12:13,607
I think I got asthma.

166
00:12:14,307 --> 00:12:15,398
Call me back.

167
00:12:24,145 --> 00:12:25,424
Lucky star motel.

168
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:28,469
Hello could you please connect me
to room 102?

169
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:29,971
102?

170
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:33,026
Nah, man, those guys checked out
middle of the night.

171
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:35,648
Wait... "guys"?
Plural?

172
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,171
Yeah... one leather jacket,
one sasquatch.

173
00:12:39,296 --> 00:12:40,499
They left.

174
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,924
Who are you?

175
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,544
Advanced placement.
Smart kid.

176
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:22,575
Virgin.

177
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,054
Frustrated virgin.

178
00:13:50,388 --> 00:13:53,853
Witchcraft, Gary?
You little satanic bastard.

179
00:13:55,338 --> 00:13:57,222
Gary! Breakfast!

180
00:13:57,997 --> 00:13:59,170
Leave me alone.

181
00:14:01,847 --> 00:14:02,847
Gary!

182
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:06,011
All right, I'm coming!

183
00:14:14,194 --> 00:14:17,830
Gary, I'd like to know
what happened last night.

184
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:19,880
So would I.
Believe me.

185
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:21,902
What happened with the plan, buddy?

186
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:25,185
- The plan?
- S.A.T's, M.I.T....

187
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:26,237
The plan.

188
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:28,429
You want to be an engineer,
you need a full ride.

189
00:14:28,554 --> 00:14:31,254
So, tell me, how does getting
drunk fit with the plan?

190
00:14:31,883 --> 00:14:32,731
Right, yeah.

191
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:36,077
Listen, buddy, no offense
but at the moment,

192
00:14:36,202 --> 00:14:37,926
I could give a rat's ass
about your plan.

193
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,346
Excuse me?

194
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:50,958
Have I seemed moody lately?

195
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,953
- With drawn?
- Wow.

196
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:56,228
- Any occult fixations?
- What?

197
00:14:56,948 --> 00:14:59,024
Let me guess...
I'm amazing at latin.

198
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,827
You have an ear for languages.

199
00:15:02,395 --> 00:15:04,496
Any of the neighborhood pets
go missing recently?

200
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:06,401
- Are you smoking drugs?
- Leonard.

201
00:15:06,732 --> 00:15:08,292
He is not smoking drugs.

202
00:15:09,148 --> 00:15:11,076
Have any of you seen me with a book?

203
00:15:11,245 --> 00:15:14,454
It'd be big and old, leather-bound,
maybe some strange writing on it.

204
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,345
Or frankly, i'm probably hiding it.

205
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,599
Gary, no!

206
00:15:20,783 --> 00:15:23,381
- What?
- You're allergic to wheat gluten.

207
00:15:41,104 --> 00:15:41,940
Gluten.

208
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:43,900
You've seriously sprung a leak.

209
00:15:44,345 --> 00:15:45,057
What?

210
00:15:45,182 --> 00:15:47,354
If mom and dad ever found
that creepy old book of yours,

211
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:50,534
you'd be grounded for a decade.
And you're bringing it up at breakfast?

212
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:51,859
So there is a book.

213
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,408
Sydney, where do I keep it?

214
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:57,570
So where we going, anyway?

215
00:15:58,106 --> 00:16:00,360
To work.
The case?

216
00:16:00,945 --> 00:16:03,662
Oh, right. The case.
Of course.

217
00:16:04,052 --> 00:16:05,751
Where do you want to start?

218
00:16:06,368 --> 00:16:08,561
Since you couldn't find
where Maggie Briggs was buried,

219
00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:11,826
now we have to do an all-day tombstone
roll to see if we can dig her up.

220
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:13,750
Wait.
Maggie Briggs?

221
00:16:14,013 --> 00:16:16,257
You mean, like...
Like, the witch Maggie Briggs?

222
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,768
- Yeah, sherlock.
- Yeah, she's in the basement.

223
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,187
Come again?

224
00:16:21,626 --> 00:16:23,543
- What basement?
- Isaiah Pickett's house.

225
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,068
There's this legend
that he hung her, but he didn't.

226
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:30,572
The real truth is is that
she was carrying his illegitimate child,

227
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,825
and he killed her
and then buried her in the basement.

228
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,522
Her "murderd chylde".

229
00:16:37,481 --> 00:16:39,719
That would explain the scratches.
How do you know all this?

230
00:16:39,844 --> 00:16:41,583
I've done
all kinds of research on it.

231
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:45,420
I mean, you know...
Last night.

232
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:51,551
Nice work... i guess.

233
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:58,478
Man, turn it up!

234
00:17:00,683 --> 00:17:01,719
Seriously?

235
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,396
Hell yeah!

236
00:17:20,563 --> 00:17:22,972
Dean!
Someone has stolen my body!

237
00:17:23,097 --> 00:17:25,126
The guy right next to you is not me!

238
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:29,152
Check your friggin' voicemail.
Damn it.

239
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:32,092
- Gary?
- Are you okay?

240
00:17:32,823 --> 00:17:34,094
Yeah, I'm Gary.

241
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,680
Gary's okay.

242
00:17:37,684 --> 00:17:40,740
So we're referring to ourselves
in the third person now?

243
00:17:40,865 --> 00:17:42,977
We heard about last night.
What happened?

244
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,896
Got drunk.
No big thing.

245
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,674
Look, what's my locker number?

246
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,608
What? Are you...
Are you still drunk?

247
00:17:48,912 --> 00:17:51,106
Yeah. I see, like,
three of you right now.

248
00:17:51,763 --> 00:17:53,237
So, what's my locker number?

249
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:34,475
Oh, no, Gary.

250
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:39,642
This is a very, very bad book.

251
00:19:06,693 --> 00:19:09,983
Boo-yah! Master chief is
in the house, bizatches!

252
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,476
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Fine.

253
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:24,885
Well, I'll be damned.

254
00:19:26,703 --> 00:19:27,896
Willow Moss.

255
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:29,327
Yeah, right.

256
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,152
It's supposed to grow
over witches' graves, right?

257
00:19:36,939 --> 00:19:37,939
Yeah.

258
00:20:13,159 --> 00:20:15,864
Hey, man,
I'm really sorry about this.

259
00:20:16,595 --> 00:20:17,850
Sorry about what?

260
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,638
Sam?!

261
00:20:26,126 --> 00:20:28,051
- You okay?
- Let's get outta here!

262
00:20:28,354 --> 00:20:30,107
We still gotta burn the body,
you idiot.

263
00:20:30,232 --> 00:20:31,390
Come on.

264
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,426
Dude...

265
00:21:01,906 --> 00:21:03,830
That was sweet!

266
00:21:07,804 --> 00:21:09,024


267
00:21:15,451 --> 00:21:16,948
Gary, wait up!

268
00:21:17,073 --> 00:21:19,235
- Where you going?
- I got something to do.

269
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,841
- You're skipping class? You?
- I'm just...

270
00:21:22,509 --> 00:21:24,532
Not feeling like myself, okay?

271
00:21:24,989 --> 00:21:26,675
Whatever it is,
we can talk it out, bro.

272
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,883
- Come with us.
- I don't have time.

273
00:21:29,008 --> 00:21:30,416
I got to go. I'm sorry.

274
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,671
Trevor!

275
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:41,661
What else was I supposed to do?

276
00:21:50,024 --> 00:21:51,424
Here you go, guys.

277
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,352
Do me a favor.

278
00:21:53,522 --> 00:21:56,564
Could you bring me
a cheeseburger with extra bacon?

279
00:21:57,113 --> 00:21:59,637
- Fry an egg on top of it, would you?
- Absolutely.

280
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,652
That sounds good. Ditto.

281
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,904
Be right back with your order.

282
00:22:05,689 --> 00:22:07,924
Who are you
and what have you done with Sam?

283
00:22:08,723 --> 00:22:10,073
What do you mean?

284
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,324
Bacon cheeseburgers now?

285
00:22:15,621 --> 00:22:17,377
I don't know, I eat 'em, don't I?

286
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,670
Anyways, we are celebrating.

287
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,900
I guess.

288
00:22:23,556 --> 00:22:25,301
Another one down.
Nice work.

289
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:26,819
You too.

290
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,331
I had a really awesome day, man.
Seriously.

291
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,616
Sweet.

292
00:22:41,157 --> 00:22:43,152
- A really awesome day?
- Why not?

293
00:22:43,587 --> 00:22:45,837
It was a random, D-list ghost hunt.

294
00:22:46,463 --> 00:22:48,063
That's awesome to you?

295
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:50,319
I can't be in a good mood?

296
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,408
Yeah, I guess.

297
00:22:54,615 --> 00:22:55,765
No, actually.

298
00:22:56,055 --> 00:22:57,709
It's not really your style, Sam.

299
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:01,212
Well, then, it's a new me.

300
00:23:01,723 --> 00:23:03,506
I mean, why shouldn't I be happy?

301
00:23:04,136 --> 00:23:06,336
I've got a gun, I'm getting drunk,

302
00:23:06,784 --> 00:23:09,178
and I look like this.

303
00:23:12,032 --> 00:23:13,182
I don't know.

304
00:23:13,623 --> 00:23:17,186
You ever feel like your whole future
is being decided for you?

305
00:23:21,004 --> 00:23:22,004
A lot.

306
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:25,300
No matter how much you fight it,
you can't stop the plan.

307
00:23:25,425 --> 00:23:27,071
The stupid, stupid plan.

308
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:30,032
So, I don't know.

309
00:23:30,157 --> 00:23:32,397
I guess it's just nice
to do a little ass-kicking

310
00:23:32,522 --> 00:23:34,272
for a change, that's all.

311
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:39,286
You know what?

312
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,751
I'm drunk.

313
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:43,045
Sorry.

314
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:45,130
- Forget it.
- It's all right.

315
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,552
I'll drink to that.

316
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,477
Is it me,
or are we drinking together?

317
00:23:59,884 --> 00:24:01,480
We don't do it that often, huh?

318
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,098
You could say that.

319
00:24:04,449 --> 00:24:05,776
Well, we should.

320
00:24:06,301 --> 00:24:07,486
You're a good guy.

321
00:24:07,987 --> 00:24:09,437
Man, you are drunk.

322
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,207
Here we go.

323
00:24:13,274 --> 00:24:14,874
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

324
00:24:15,711 --> 00:24:17,111
No, but I mean it.

325
00:24:18,948 --> 00:24:20,198
You really are.

326
00:24:28,381 --> 00:24:29,681
The bread alone!

327
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,291
Love that jacket on you, by the way.

328
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:47,552
Thanks.

329
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:49,122
Actually...

330
00:24:50,338 --> 00:24:52,038
The whole outfit is new.

331
00:25:01,086 --> 00:25:02,486
We're gonna do it!

332
00:25:27,312 --> 00:25:29,062
What the hell's going on?

333
00:25:29,187 --> 00:25:32,183
You can scream all you want.
No one can hear you!

334
00:25:32,308 --> 00:25:34,158
My parents are out of town!

335
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,918
- T. What up?
- Where are you?

336
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,747
I can't really tell you right now,
but, man, you wouldn't believe it.

337
00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:45,521
Where's Dean?

338
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,303
The Cloverleaf on route 6. Why?

339
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,380
You haven't killed him?

340
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,593
Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean?
Kill Dean?

341
00:25:55,238 --> 00:25:56,595
I'm building up to it.

342
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,346
We got problems here. For one...

343
00:25:59,697 --> 00:26:03,602
I'm looking at your body right now
with this other dude in it.

344
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,606
He's been in your house,
with your parents.

345
00:26:07,974 --> 00:26:09,691
Okay, just calm down.

346
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:12,819
Whatever he says, no one's
gonna believe him, right?

347
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,780
I mean, we're still good.

348
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,656
Hurry up and kill him.

349
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:17,908
I'll do it!

350
00:26:19,021 --> 00:26:20,071
You better.

351
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,705
Gotta go.

352
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:30,880
Man, I am in way over my head.

353
00:26:33,074 --> 00:26:36,582
- I don't think he's gonna do it.
- Relax. This is Gary.

354
00:26:36,707 --> 00:26:39,471
What is going on here?
How do you know Dean?

355
00:26:39,874 --> 00:26:41,424
Everybody knows Dean.

356
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,266
He's hell's most wanted.

357
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,147
Have you idiots
been talking to demons?

358
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,099
Right, we're the idiots.

359
00:26:52,406 --> 00:26:55,956
You're just kids. You have no idea
what you're messing with.

360
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,284
We know that there's a price
on Dean's head,

361
00:26:58,409 --> 00:26:59,699
and we're gonna collect.

362
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,658
What's that supposed to mean?

363
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:06,373
About a month ago,
we were down here...

364
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,667
What?
We're not allowed to talk about him?

365
00:27:10,872 --> 00:27:13,129
We were down here,
goofing around with that book.

366
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,962
I wouldn't exactly call
praying to our dark overlord

367
00:27:16,087 --> 00:27:17,175
"goofing around."

368
00:27:17,396 --> 00:27:19,896
- Don't be a loser, Trev.
- Yeah, Trev.

369
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:22,602
Anyway, all of a sudden,
the lights flickered

370
00:27:22,727 --> 00:27:25,127
and Gary
went into this weird trance.

371
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:29,478
He closed his eyes, picked up a pencil,
and drew this.

372
00:27:31,915 --> 00:27:33,585
You know what's really weird?

373
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,310
Gary can't draw.

374
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,540
He said he heard a voice
in his head.

375
00:27:38,786 --> 00:27:40,573
The demons were putting out
a bounty.

376
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:41,784
A bounty?

377
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,369
To, like, every witch or satanist

378
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:46,329
across the whole country.

379
00:27:47,928 --> 00:27:49,958
Gary's the one who spotted you.

380
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,127
And the "Freaky Friday" crap?

381
00:27:52,643 --> 00:27:54,682
Another spell from the book.
Gary's idea...

382
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:56,965
Go in Trojan horse-style.

383
00:27:57,978 --> 00:27:59,378
He's really smart.

384
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,772
If he has the beanbags
to go through with it.

385
00:28:01,897 --> 00:28:03,047
Listen to me.

386
00:28:03,733 --> 00:28:05,933
You are making a terrible mistake.

387
00:28:06,821 --> 00:28:08,971
We're talking about a demon deal.

388
00:28:09,762 --> 00:28:12,112
Killing somebody.
This isn't a game.

389
00:28:13,328 --> 00:28:14,928
You're crossing a line

390
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:16,693
you won't come back from.

391
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:18,159
Believe me.

392
00:28:24,199 --> 00:28:25,199
What?

393
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,670
Nothing.

394
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,953
Nora, don't tell me
you're actually listening to this jerk.

395
00:28:31,078 --> 00:28:32,228
I don't know.

396
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,660
Maybe.
I mean, what if he has a point?

397
00:28:34,785 --> 00:28:36,546
I don't believe this.
First Gary, now you.

398
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,381
I can't...

399
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,370
You know what?

400
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:46,691
Fine.

401
00:28:47,147 --> 00:28:48,710
You want something done right...

402
00:28:48,835 --> 00:28:51,603
What, you're gonna go
kill Dean yourself, tough guy?

403
00:28:52,175 --> 00:28:54,314
Don't have to. I can do this.

404
00:28:57,194 --> 00:29:00,378
- You can't be serious.
- I'm calling up one of these bad boys,

405
00:29:00,503 --> 00:29:03,156
turning these punks over,
and getting paid.

406
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,573
Dollar bills, y'all!

407
00:29:04,698 --> 00:29:06,805
I don't think that's a good idea.

408
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:09,204
- It's not. It's a very bad idea.
- No one asked you.

409
00:29:56,582 --> 00:29:57,832
You're not Sam.

410
00:29:58,838 --> 00:29:59,921
Who are you?

411
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:06,699
- Don't do this, I'm begging you.
- Trevor, I think he's right.

412
00:30:07,315 --> 00:30:09,208
You wanna get into Vassar,
don't you?

413
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,935
- Attrahendum eos ad ligandum
- You're gonna get us killed!

414
00:30:14,637 --> 00:30:15,854
Eos pariter

415
00:30:16,712 --> 00:30:18,043
eos coram me!

416
00:30:24,891 --> 00:30:26,157
Maybe I said it wrong.

417
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,745
- Don't touch her!
- Nora, you okay?

418
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:37,900
I'm peachy.

419
00:30:41,027 --> 00:30:42,586


420
00:30:43,158 --> 00:30:45,708
So, what'd you call me here for,
Skippy?

421
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:47,805
Unless...

422
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,780
It's dinnertime?

423
00:30:51,355 --> 00:30:52,355
What?

424
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,710
We have Dean Winchester.

425
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,149
You do?

426
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,220
Where?

427
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:04,555
Trevor, keep your mouth shut.

428
00:31:05,653 --> 00:31:08,580
The Cloverleaf motel
over on route 6.

429
00:31:15,163 --> 00:31:16,498
Is that you in there?

430
00:31:21,545 --> 00:31:25,424
Aren't you just
98 pounds of nothing?

431
00:31:27,138 --> 00:31:28,552
The kid is a moron.

432
00:31:29,538 --> 00:31:31,597
He doesn't have any idea
where Dean is.

433
00:31:35,607 --> 00:31:37,060
If Sam's in this body,

434
00:31:38,428 --> 00:31:39,521
who's in Sam's?

435
00:31:41,637 --> 00:31:43,137
A dangerous warlock.

436
00:31:46,142 --> 00:31:47,192
Named Gary.

437
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:51,641
You mean to tell me
you've got Dean Winchester

438
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,119
and Sam winchester's meat suit?

439
00:31:56,075 --> 00:31:59,600
An empty vessel
just waiting to be filled.

440
00:32:00,655 --> 00:32:03,205
And you're handing them both
over to me?

441
00:32:05,034 --> 00:32:06,034
I guess.

442
00:32:07,379 --> 00:32:08,379
Well...

443
00:32:09,546 --> 00:32:10,886
I got to hand it to you.

444
00:32:12,967 --> 00:32:14,167
I'm impressed.

445
00:32:15,692 --> 00:32:16,692
Thanks.

446
00:32:17,931 --> 00:32:20,131
So, if you don't mind my asking...

447
00:32:22,297 --> 00:32:23,647
There's a reward?

448
00:32:24,573 --> 00:32:25,573
Sure.

449
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:29,428
My undying gratitude.

450
00:32:35,898 --> 00:32:38,490
- What, are you serious?
- Be quiet, you idiot!

451
00:32:38,615 --> 00:32:40,248
Consider yourself lucky, kid.

452
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,830
Wait a minute!

453
00:32:46,647 --> 00:32:48,131
We worked our asses off here,

454
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,254
and I want my reward!

455
00:33:01,865 --> 00:33:02,865
Please?

456
00:33:07,978 --> 00:33:08,978
I'm sorry.

457
00:33:09,268 --> 00:33:10,418
You're right.

458
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,830
What can I get you?

459
00:33:15,152 --> 00:33:16,535
How about a million bucks?

460
00:33:16,943 --> 00:33:19,746
For God's sake, Trevor,
just shut up and run!

461
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:22,374
A million doesn't buy you much
these days. Make it 10?

462
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,792
Okay, $10 mill.

463
00:33:24,143 --> 00:33:25,293
And I want...

464
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,798
I want Mindy Schwartz to love me.

465
00:33:31,872 --> 00:33:33,901
Love... Money...

466
00:33:34,711 --> 00:33:37,639
Sticking to the basics.
I can respect that.

467
00:33:39,388 --> 00:33:40,988
But here's my counter.

468
00:33:59,231 --> 00:34:00,631
Tastes like moron.

469
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,907
You have 38 messages.

470
00:34:10,438 --> 00:34:12,066
This is gonna sound crazy.

471
00:34:12,191 --> 00:34:15,091
Really crazy
but I think I'm in the wrong body.

472
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,080
Dean, the guy right next to you
is not me!

473
00:34:24,536 --> 00:34:27,105
Dean, check your friggin' voicemail.
Damn it.

474
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,864
All right, pal.
Start talking or I start waterboarding.

475
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,366
Please, don't hurt me.
Please! I'm sorry!

476
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:39,884
I'm so, so sorry!

477
00:34:40,153 --> 00:34:42,704
- Pull it together, champ.
- I don't want to die.

478
00:34:42,874 --> 00:34:44,372
I don't want to die.

479
00:34:44,497 --> 00:34:45,597
Where's sam?

480
00:34:45,722 --> 00:34:48,919
In my friend's basement.
His parents are out of town.

481
00:34:49,562 --> 00:34:50,562
Parents?

482
00:34:50,911 --> 00:34:53,256
- How old are you?
- 17.

483
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,142
Nora?

484
00:35:08,116 --> 00:35:09,516
Not at the moment.

485
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:29,193
Damn it!

486
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:38,403
Boy, you earned your dessert tonight,
kiddo.

487
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,345
Tell me...

488
00:35:40,857 --> 00:35:42,357
What is it you want?

489
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,976
Anything.

490
00:35:44,882 --> 00:35:45,882
Anything?

491
00:35:49,295 --> 00:35:50,445
Lay it on me.

492
00:35:51,098 --> 00:35:52,648
I want to be a witch.

493
00:35:52,936 --> 00:35:53,936
For real.

494
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:55,944
And really powerful.

495
00:35:56,319 --> 00:35:57,236
Good choice.

496
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,060
I get it.

497
00:36:00,213 --> 00:36:03,690
No daddy, no MIT,

498
00:36:04,318 --> 00:36:05,318
no plan.

499
00:36:06,357 --> 00:36:08,908
You get to be big and strong,

500
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:11,167
and no one can tell you
what to do anymore.

501
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,006
There's just
one small formality first.

502
00:36:19,691 --> 00:36:20,969
You gotta meet the boss.

503
00:36:22,187 --> 00:36:23,187
The boss?

504
00:36:23,463 --> 00:36:25,676
You know, your satanic majesty,

505
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:28,018
or whatever the kids
are calling it these days.

506
00:36:30,043 --> 00:36:31,043
The devil?

507
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:38,970
It's okay.

508
00:36:39,942 --> 00:36:41,657
I don't really wanna bother him.

509
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,782
But he's gonna wanna meet you.

510
00:36:45,017 --> 00:36:47,407
Relax, it'll be easy.

511
00:36:47,929 --> 00:36:50,679
He's just gonna ask you
one little question,

512
00:36:50,804 --> 00:36:52,954
and all you got to do is say yes.

513
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,320
And then...

514
00:36:56,146 --> 00:36:57,646
You get your reward.

515
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:15,357
Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus.

516
00:37:16,262 --> 00:37:17,442
What was that?

517
00:37:18,865 --> 00:37:22,155
- Nothing.
- Were you trying to exorcise me?!

518
00:37:22,892 --> 00:37:24,642
You little piece of crap!

519
00:37:28,617 --> 00:37:31,623
Spiritus, omnis satanica potestas.

520
00:37:34,638 --> 00:37:36,336
Omnis incursio

521
00:37:36,709 --> 00:37:38,755
infernalis adversii.

522
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,715
Omnis congregatio.

523
00:37:42,111 --> 00:37:43,811
Et secta diabolica.

524
00:37:43,936 --> 00:37:45,637
Ergo, draco maledicte.

525
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:48,515
Ecclesiam tuam securi tibi facias

526
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,183
libertate servire.

527
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,401
Te rogamus.

528
00:37:51,526 --> 00:37:52,686
Adios, bitch!

529
00:37:54,103 --> 00:37:55,188
It's audi nos.

530
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,319


531
00:38:15,444 --> 00:38:17,542
Animae domum redeant.

532
00:38:18,228 --> 00:38:21,169
Fas atque nefas instauretur.

533
00:38:22,728 --> 00:38:26,239
Potestate et auctoritate,

534
00:38:26,623 --> 00:38:27,623
sic fiat.

535
00:38:44,424 --> 00:38:45,524
So, we good?

536
00:38:45,649 --> 00:38:46,999
Yeah. We're good.

537
00:38:47,976 --> 00:38:49,576
Man, it's nice to be back.

538
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,870
Awesome.

539
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,460
I know.

540
00:38:58,158 --> 00:38:59,158
My bad.

541
00:39:00,709 --> 00:39:01,709
My bad?

542
00:39:04,028 --> 00:39:05,592
"My bad" ain't gonna cut it.

543
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:08,483
See, if you were of voting age...

544
00:39:09,792 --> 00:39:12,556
You'd be dead.
Because we would kill you.

545
00:39:14,528 --> 00:39:16,103
So straighten up and fly right

546
00:39:16,443 --> 00:39:17,604
or we will kill you.

547
00:39:19,405 --> 00:39:20,555
Are we clear?

548
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,420
- Crystal.
- Good.

549
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:39,339
Crap.

550
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:40,464
Gary...

551
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:44,256
Take it from someone who knows.

552
00:39:44,837 --> 00:39:45,987
Chin up, man.

553
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,563
Your life ain't that bad.

554
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,836
You met my parents.

555
00:39:49,961 --> 00:39:51,661
So what? It's your life.

556
00:39:51,786 --> 00:39:54,808
You don't like their plan for you,
tell them to cram it.

557
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:56,018
Rebel a little.

558
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:59,576
In a healthy non-satanic way,
of course.

559
00:40:07,392 --> 00:40:09,910
By the way,
you know why nora's into witchcraft?

560
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:13,585
- What do you mean?
- She doesn't like Satan. She likes you.

561
00:40:14,844 --> 00:40:15,844
Really?

562
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,769
- You think?
- I know.

563
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:22,552
I'm telling you, kid.
I wish I had your life.

564
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:23,886
You do?

565
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:25,839
Thanks.

566
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,290
Get outta here.

567
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,229
That was a nice thing to say.

568
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:43,958
I totally lied.

569
00:40:44,988 --> 00:40:46,693
That kid's life sucked ass.

570
00:40:59,347 --> 00:41:01,102
All that apple-pie, family crap?

571
00:41:01,227 --> 00:41:04,336
It's stressful, trust me.
We didn't miss a damn thing.

572
00:41:04,626 --> 00:41:06,562
Or we don't know what we're missing.
