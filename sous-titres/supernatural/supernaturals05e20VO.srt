1
00:00:02,208 --> 00:00:03,544
What would I do without you?

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,220
- Something turned him into a monster.
- What are we dealing with? Do you know?

3
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,721
Croatoan. It's a virus
of plague and pestilence.

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,765
Who knows how far
this thing can spread?

5
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,250
It's Crowley, right?

6
00:00:22,905 --> 00:00:25,920
And why exactly would you want
the devil dead?

7
00:00:26,045 --> 00:00:27,068
Survival.

8
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:30,769
If lucifer manages
to exterminate human kind,

9
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:32,156
we're next.

10
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:35,580
The cage you sprung lucifer from...
You can shove his ass back in.

11
00:00:35,705 --> 00:00:38,996
The key to the cage...
Four rings from the horsemen.

12
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,665
Well, we got war's.

13
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,834
We nicked famine's.

14
00:00:44,343 --> 00:00:46,280
That's two rings down.
Collect all four.

15
00:00:46,707 --> 00:00:50,041
- Just need pestilence and death.
- Is that all?

16
00:01:02,914 --> 00:01:04,877
I'm just glad we got
something to offer people.

17
00:01:05,002 --> 00:01:08,727
I'm sorry. It's a load of crap...
Pure profit-driven crap.

18
00:01:09,396 --> 00:01:11,062
Swine flu... It's an epidemic.

19
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,239
If Niveus was really worried
about the epidemic,

20
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,293
they'd be giving
the vaccine out for free.

21
00:01:15,418 --> 00:01:18,327
- This supposed new formula?
- They say it's faster-acting.

22
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,039
Maybe it is,
but human trials this week?

23
00:01:21,507 --> 00:01:24,175
- Yeah, it does seem a little rushed.
- A little rushed?

24
00:01:24,557 --> 00:01:26,182
Have you even seen the new vaccine?

25
00:01:26,307 --> 00:01:27,628
- No.
- Neither have I.

26
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:28,937
I have.

27
00:01:31,037 --> 00:01:33,709
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm running the experiment.

28
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:38,790
What the hell?!

29
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:42,637
Relax.
You're part of it, too.

30
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:10,754
Well, looks like it works.

31
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:12,440
= 520 =

32
00:02:14,306 --> 00:02:16,802
= Supernatural Team =

33
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:29,870
Check it out...
I look like the king of pop.

34
00:02:30,177 --> 00:02:32,308
- Too soon?
- Too soon.

35
00:02:32,545 --> 00:02:34,755
Don't get me wrong...
I'm glad the CDC is here,

36
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,868
but what we really need is vaccine.

37
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:38,452
You got that right.

38
00:02:38,577 --> 00:02:41,119
Tell me, have you noticed anything
unusual about the strain...

39
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,984
Any signs of behavioral change,
like aggression, maybe?

40
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:46,088
Excuse me?

41
00:02:46,213 --> 00:02:49,294
Have the flu victims shown
any signs of homicidal tendencies?

42
00:02:53,415 --> 00:02:55,152
Symptomatically speaking,
we're looking at

43
00:02:55,277 --> 00:02:57,802
a relatively mild case
of swine flu here.

44
00:02:58,608 --> 00:03:00,778
Probably add up to
a miserable week off of work,

45
00:03:00,903 --> 00:03:02,723
- and that's about it.
- So nothing unusual.

46
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,469
Day and a half ago,
we didn't have a single case.

47
00:03:06,594 --> 00:03:08,257
Now we're looking at over 70...

48
00:03:08,704 --> 00:03:10,564
The infectious equivalent
of a briefcase bomb.

49
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:14,234
- So I might call that a little unusual.
- Day and a half?

50
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,650
That's the same time
those statues started crying.

51
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:19,240
- I'm sorry. What was that?
- What was what?

52
00:03:19,512 --> 00:03:21,826
Did you just say a bunch
of statues started crying?

53
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:23,812
- What? Why, no.
No. Who would...

54
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:26,297
- Who would say that? Crazy people.
- Exactly.

55
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,160
- Which we are not.
- No.

56
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,794
Just...
Get us some vaccine.

57
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:45,059
Let me guess...
Another steamin'-hot pile of swine flu.

58
00:03:45,335 --> 00:03:47,028
- Yep.
- Doesn't make any sense, Bobby.

59
00:03:47,153 --> 00:03:49,228
Pestilence touched down here.
I'm sure of it.

60
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:51,466
But why is he dealing them
soft serve like swine flu

61
00:03:51,591 --> 00:03:53,983
when he's got the croatoan virus
up his sleeve? I don't get it.

62
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:56,310
Doesn't matter what the sick
son of a bitch is doing.

63
00:03:56,435 --> 00:03:58,442
What matters is this is
the fourth town he's hit...

64
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:01,282
That we know of
and we're still eating his dust.

65
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,610
Did you get anything?

66
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:05,780
We got even a snowball
at probable next target?

67
00:04:06,908 --> 00:04:09,290
- No pattern we can see.
- Okay.

68
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:10,715
Hold on.

69
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:19,126
Far as I can tell,
he's still heading East,

70
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:22,212
So... Head East, I guess.

71
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:26,661
- East?
- Bobby, we're in West Nevada.

72
00:04:26,786 --> 00:04:28,245
East is practically all there is.

73
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,345
Yeah, you better get to drivin'.

74
00:04:34,353 --> 00:04:36,510
Say...
I've got an idea.

75
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,401
- Did you get him?
- He's gone.

76
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,549
Fancy a fag and a chat?

77
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:52,460
You're upset. We should discuss it.
Not here, but...

78
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:54,488
You want to talk?
After what you did to us?

79
00:04:54,613 --> 00:04:57,796
After what I did to you?!
I gave you The Colt!

80
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,882
And you knew it wouldn't
work against the devil!

81
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,842
- I never!
- You set us up.

82
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,540
We lost people
on that suicide run...

83
00:05:05,152 --> 00:05:05,999
Good people!

84
00:05:06,124 --> 00:05:08,599
Who you take on the ride
is your own business!

85
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:12,299
Look, everything is still the same.

86
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:14,521
- We're all still in this together.
- Sure we are.

87
00:05:16,342 --> 00:05:17,824
Call your dog off, please.

88
00:05:20,143 --> 00:05:21,355
Give me one good reason.

89
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:23,455
I can give you pestilence.

90
00:05:24,163 --> 00:05:26,617
- What do you know about pestilence?
- I know how to get him.

91
00:05:27,499 --> 00:05:29,143
That's got your interest,
doesn't it?

92
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,583
Are you actually listening to this?

93
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,855
- Are you friggin' nuts?!
- Shut up for a second!

94
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,796
Shut up, the both of you!

95
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:41,274
Look... I swear...

96
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,759
I thought The Colt would work.
It's an honest mistake.

97
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,928
It's all part
of the learning process.

98
00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:49,761
But nothing's changed.
I still want the devil dead.

99
00:05:50,882 --> 00:05:53,546
One thing's changed. Now the devil knows
that I want him dead.

100
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:56,679
Which, by the way, makes me the most
buggered son in all of creation.

101
00:05:56,804 --> 00:05:58,227
Holy crap.
We don't care.

102
00:05:58,352 --> 00:06:00,218
They burnt down my house!

103
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,363
They ate my tailor!

104
00:06:05,557 --> 00:06:09,370
Two months under a rock,
like a bloody salamander!

105
00:06:09,987 --> 00:06:13,102
Every demon on hell and earth's
got his eyes out for me!

106
00:06:13,766 --> 00:06:15,970
And yet...
Here I am...

107
00:06:16,546 --> 00:06:18,466
Last place I should be...

108
00:06:18,814 --> 00:06:21,582
In the road, talking
to Sam and Dean Winchester,

109
00:06:22,023 --> 00:06:23,931
Under a friggin' spotlight!

110
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:36,145
So come with me.
Please.

111
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,485
Do you want
the horsemen rings or not?

112
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:48,615
Yes, I know all about that.
Shall we?

113
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,680
Here we are...

114
00:07:05,944 --> 00:07:07,792
My life on the lam.

115
00:07:08,188 --> 00:07:10,000
How the mighty have fallen.

116
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:12,016
Single-pane glass,

117
00:07:12,268 --> 00:07:14,266
used contraception in the fireplace.

118
00:07:16,525 --> 00:07:19,356
- The water damage alone...
- My heart's bleeding for you.

119
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:21,709
Now, how do you know
about the rings?

120
00:07:22,392 --> 00:07:25,444
Well, now... I've been keeping
a close eye on you lot.

121
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,571
We got hex bags.
We're hidden from demons.

122
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,124
All but one.

123
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:31,843
That night you broke into my house,

124
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:36,114
Our first date, my valet hid
a tracking device in your car...

125
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,995
A magical coin that easily trumps
your little bags o'bones.

126
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:42,449
It allows me to hear things, too...

127
00:07:42,574 --> 00:07:45,417
And, my, the things I've heard.

128
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,626
So you want to cram the devil
back in the box?

129
00:07:50,524 --> 00:07:52,091
Cunning scheme.

130
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,139
I want in.

131
00:07:56,464 --> 00:07:58,060
You said you could
get us pestilence.

132
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:00,524
Well, now...

133
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:04,500
I don't know where pestilence is...

134
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,054
Per Se.

135
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:10,319
But I do know the demon who does.

136
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,862
He's what you might call
the horsemen's stable boy.

137
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:18,358
He handles their itineraries,
their personal needs.

138
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,093
He's who you want... believe me.

139
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,961
- He'll tell us where sneezy's at.
- How do we get him to spill?

140
00:08:25,086 --> 00:08:27,508
- Rip out his toenails?
- No.

141
00:08:28,201 --> 00:08:30,189
Nuts at his pay grade don't crack.

142
00:08:30,314 --> 00:08:32,177
We bring him here, then I sell him.

143
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:33,470
Sell him?

144
00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:36,917
Please.
I've sold sin to saints for centuries.

145
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,309
Think I can't close
one little demon?

146
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:42,960
All right,
so where's this demon of yours?

147
00:08:45,262 --> 00:08:47,137
I don't want to hear "weeks."

148
00:08:47,262 --> 00:08:49,069
I want to hear "days."

149
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:51,556
But the lab isn't even
finished testing yet.

150
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:53,137
You let me worry about the lab.

151
00:08:53,262 --> 00:08:55,828
But, sir, you're asking for distribution
on an unprecedented scale.

152
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,771
We have an unprecedented outbreak.

153
00:08:58,148 --> 00:09:01,874
The nation is terrified
of swine flu.

154
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:06,146
They want our vaccine.
They need our vaccine.

155
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:09,016
It's called "demand," people.
Now, supply!

156
00:09:09,501 --> 00:09:10,632
We're doing our best.

157
00:09:11,863 --> 00:09:13,987
Oh, you're doing your best?
You're doing your best?

158
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,847
Then do the best of somebody better!

159
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:29,348
You wanted to see me?

160
00:09:29,473 --> 00:09:31,238
Mitchell, yes.
Come on in.

161
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:34,341
Look, Mr. Brady,
I know how important this is,

162
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:37,602
- and I'm sorry if I sounded...
- No apologies.

163
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,305
Mitch, I need people like you.

164
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:43,851
- Really?
- Really.

165
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,200
In fact, there is a position
in communications

166
00:09:48,325 --> 00:09:51,091
that I think you would be
perfect for.

167
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,009
- Sounds great.
- Is great. So what do you say?

168
00:09:54,515 --> 00:09:57,394
You ready to enter the cutthroat world
of upper management?

169
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:58,680
Awesome.

170
00:09:58,848 --> 00:09:59,790
Awesome.

171
00:10:04,394 --> 00:10:06,129
Watch the shoes, please.

172
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:11,876
Get the rest later.
Thanks.

173
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:23,590
Dis manibus praeest praesens...

174
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:28,001
... Obtine mihi dominum

175
00:10:28,126 --> 00:10:30,388
Pestilentiarum omnium.

176
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:52,614
Sir, great news. The vaccine trials...
the results have been...

177
00:10:53,404 --> 00:10:56,488
Really quite grotesque.
I think you'll be pleased.

178
00:10:58,067 --> 00:10:59,115
How soon?

179
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:02,691
Distribution on this scale.
We do need some humans.

180
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:04,122
We can't possess them all.

181
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,329
And don't even get me started
on the teamsters. I...

182
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:10,604
I know.
I'm doing my best.

183
00:11:12,198 --> 00:11:12,963
Yes, sir.

184
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:17,001
The best of someone better.

185
00:11:22,002 --> 00:11:23,380


186
00:11:27,462 --> 00:11:29,281
Why are we even
listening to him, Dean?

187
00:11:29,643 --> 00:11:31,648
- This is totally insane.
- I don't disagree.

188
00:11:33,703 --> 00:11:36,426
One big happy family, are we, then?
Fantastic.

189
00:11:37,137 --> 00:11:39,956
- You ready to go?
- Yes. Yes. I am.

190
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:41,884
Sam, keep the home fires burning.

191
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:43,493
What are you talking about?

192
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,703
- Sam's not coming.
- And why the hell not?

193
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:47,484
Because I don't like you...

194
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:49,849
I don't trust you...

195
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:53,794
And... oh, yes...
You keep trying to kill me.

196
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:56,795
There's no damn way.
This isn't gonna happen!

197
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,209
I'm not asking you, am I?
'cause you're not invited.

198
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:01,369
I'm asking you.
What's it gonna be?

199
00:12:09,214 --> 00:12:12,684
Gentlemen...
Enjoy your last few sunsets.

200
00:12:15,707 --> 00:12:16,443
Wait.

201
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,169
I'll go.

202
00:12:35,392 --> 00:12:36,922
What can I say?
I believe the guy.

203
00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:00,112
And then Dean just walks...

204
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,976
Right out the door with Crowley.

205
00:13:06,283 --> 00:13:09,246
Look, Sam, I got no love for demons,

206
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:12,380
And, yeah,
this whole thing is crazy but...

207
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:14,718
I don't know.

208
00:13:14,843 --> 00:13:18,379
After a year of chasing up zilch,
maybe it's time to go crazy.

209
00:13:19,845 --> 00:13:20,841
Yeah, maybe.

210
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,497
- Hey, Bobby?
- Yeah?

211
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:32,569
- Remember that time you were possessed?
- Yeah. Rings a bell.

212
00:13:32,857 --> 00:13:34,972
When Meg told you
to kill Dean, you didn't.

213
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,398
You took your body back.

214
00:13:36,801 --> 00:13:39,443
Just long enough
to shank myself, yeah.

215
00:13:39,728 --> 00:13:41,611
Well, how'd you do it?

216
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,738
I mean, how'd you
take back the wheel?

217
00:13:46,427 --> 00:13:47,708
Why are you asking, Sam?

218
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,210
Say we can open the cage.

219
00:13:53,335 --> 00:13:55,198
Great. But then what?

220
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,336
We just lead the devil to the edge
and get him to jump in?

221
00:13:58,704 --> 00:13:59,704
You got me.

222
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:03,400
What if you guys lead the devil
to the edge and I jump in?

223
00:14:05,103 --> 00:14:07,437
It'd be just like when you turned
the knife around on yourself.

224
00:14:07,562 --> 00:14:08,972
One action... just one leap.

225
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,742
- Are you idjits trying to kill me?!
- Bobby...

226
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:13,899
We just got done talking
your brother off the ledge,

227
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:15,645
and now you're
lining up to say "yes"?

228
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,621
It's not like that. I'm not gonna do it.
Not unless we all agree.

229
00:14:18,746 --> 00:14:20,478
But I think we got to
look at our options.

230
00:14:20,603 --> 00:14:22,697
- This isn't an option.
- Why not?

231
00:14:22,822 --> 00:14:24,111
You can't do it.

232
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,795
What I did was a million-to-one,

233
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,743
And that was some pissant demon
I was brain-wrestling.

234
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:33,037
You're talking about taking back
control from Satan himself.

235
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,464
Yeah, I am.

236
00:14:36,896 --> 00:14:40,711
Kid...
It's called "possession" for a reason.

237
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:44,041
You, of all people, ought to know.

238
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,456
- I'm strong enough.
- You ain't.

239
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:49,680
He's gonna find
every chink in your armor, Sam,

240
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,305
and use it against you...

241
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:54,651
Your fear, your grief, your anger.
And let's face it...

242
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:57,019
You're not exactly
Mr. Anger management.

243
00:14:57,455 --> 00:15:01,191
How are you gonna control the devil
When you can't control yourself?

244
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,738
Demons?

245
00:15:12,348 --> 00:15:14,464
Nah.
Human shields.

246
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:17,214
The demons are up top...
12th floor.

247
00:15:19,057 --> 00:15:21,623
All right, then. We'll have to find
a way in through the back.

248
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,048
You Winchesters
make everything so complicated.

249
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,466
Ah, crap.

250
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,316
Oh, crap.

251
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,652
Crap! Crap!

252
00:15:42,652 --> 00:15:43,692
Door's open!

253
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:56,470
What?

254
00:15:58,335 --> 00:15:59,600
You killed them?

255
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:07,925
We're on a tight schedule.
Come on.

256
00:16:10,527 --> 00:16:12,841
Now you're squeamish?
Please.

257
00:16:16,838 --> 00:16:18,041
Go get 'em, tiger.

258
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:21,277
You're not coming?

259
00:16:21,402 --> 00:16:23,565
No. It's not safe up there.
There's demons.

260
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:26,576
- Yeah, I get that.
- Look, just do what I told you,

261
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:28,861
And try to be convincing.

262
00:16:29,141 --> 00:16:31,156
It'll work like a charm.
Trust me.

263
00:16:54,465 --> 00:16:58,080
Dean Winchester.
What, no appointment?

264
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:05,064
Kind of an 11th-hour thing,
you know?

265
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,008
Well, then, you're just on time.

266
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:11,512
Have a seat.

267
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,951
How's your brother?

268
00:17:26,065 --> 00:17:28,129
Well, down to business, then.

269
00:17:31,974 --> 00:17:33,801
What can I do for you?

270
00:17:34,441 --> 00:17:36,205
Actually, it's about
what I can do for you.

271
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:37,082
Really?

272
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:41,037
Me and Sam dropped two of your jockeys.
I think you know that.

273
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,519
Yes. I got the memo.

274
00:17:42,953 --> 00:17:45,605
We kept their secret power rings.

275
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,607
Which is why I'm here.

276
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,842
I heard some folks saying
that you wanted them back

277
00:17:52,263 --> 00:17:53,926
and you were willing to pay.

278
00:17:56,974 --> 00:17:58,951
- Where are they?
- Not here.

279
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,767
But you want them,
you'll come with me.

280
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:02,073
Nice and civil.

281
00:18:02,198 --> 00:18:03,929
We'll get out of
your little batcave here,

282
00:18:04,054 --> 00:18:05,484
and we'll discuss a transaction.

283
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,796
Who says I want them?

284
00:18:11,606 --> 00:18:12,649
What?

285
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:16,110
Who... Says... I want them?

286
00:18:18,907 --> 00:18:21,141
You know...
Folks.

287
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:29,864
See War and famine,

288
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:33,603
even if I could cram the rings
back on their bony fingers,

289
00:18:33,728 --> 00:18:36,442
I doubt it would do much good.

290
00:18:37,406 --> 00:18:39,376
They're withered husks right now...

291
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:42,936
Fetal position on the floor...
All thanks to you.

292
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,624
So I don't want the rings.

293
00:18:48,642 --> 00:18:51,087
What I want is retribution.

294
00:18:51,582 --> 00:18:54,848
And I'm gonna rip it
right out of your ass!

295
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:05,100
This...

296
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:08,005
... is so good.

297
00:19:09,744 --> 00:19:10,932
Therapeutic, for sure.

298
00:19:11,057 --> 00:19:14,110
Dean, I really owe you one, buddy,

299
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,694
'cause I feel...

300
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,301
... so

301
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,516
... much

302
00:19:20,097 --> 00:19:21,518
better!

303
00:19:30,547 --> 00:19:31,669


304
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:37,717
Dean, where are you going?
We're just getting started!

305
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:22,220
Good meeting, Dean.

306
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,763
You know, I'm excited.

307
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:27,684
Evening, uncle.

308
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:41,438
What the hell was that?

309
00:20:41,965 --> 00:20:43,074
That was perfect.

310
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:44,569
Perfect?

311
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,495
He didn't want the rings,
he wanted me.

312
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:50,081
Imagine the surprise on your face.

313
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,994
- What?
- Your ignorance and misinformation...

314
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,655
I mean, completely authentic.
You can't fake that.

315
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,372
What? It went like clockwork.

316
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:00,884
Not for me, you son of a bitch!

317
00:21:02,423 --> 00:21:04,846
That's what you get,
working with a demon.

318
00:21:14,153 --> 00:21:16,020
Hot stuff, watch the upholstery!

319
00:21:16,145 --> 00:21:17,275
Up yours, mate.

320
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,863
This bit of carving
will tie our friend here down.

321
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,865
No zapping off, no smoking out.

322
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,541
Locked in the meat suit.

323
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:27,744
An important piece
of our bargaining strategy.

324
00:21:29,986 --> 00:21:31,136
Now, up here,

325
00:21:31,536 --> 00:21:32,908
we don't want I-50.

326
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:34,233
Take 93 north.

327
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,668
What?

328
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,212
We can't take this guy
back to your brother.

329
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,760
Why the hell not?

330
00:21:43,395 --> 00:21:44,395
Crowley!

331
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,372
They got history, all right?

332
00:21:54,943 --> 00:21:56,898
You wanna go anywhere,
you start talking.

333
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,191
What history?

334
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:26,216
Where's Dean?

335
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:29,669
Now...

336
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,420
For the record,

337
00:22:31,576 --> 00:22:32,926
I'm against this.

338
00:22:33,545 --> 00:22:37,397
Negotiating a high-level defection,
it's very delicate business.

339
00:22:42,126 --> 00:22:44,862
- What are you talking about?
- I begged Dean not to come back.

340
00:22:45,378 --> 00:22:47,281
We should be miles away from you.

341
00:22:48,173 --> 00:22:51,452
He replied with a colorful rejoinder
about my "corn chute."

342
00:22:55,206 --> 00:22:56,356
So, go ahead.

343
00:22:57,282 --> 00:22:59,740
Go! Ruin our last best hope.

344
00:23:05,253 --> 00:23:07,303
It's only the end of the world.

345
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,440
What's going on?

346
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:23,931
I need you to stay on mission, okay?

347
00:23:24,442 --> 00:23:27,079
- Focused.
- What's all this about?

348
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,073
I'm doing this 'cause I trust you.

349
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,325
Trust me to what?

350
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:35,789
Sam, is that you?

351
00:23:44,779 --> 00:23:45,779
Brady?

352
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:51,608
Brady hasn't been Brady in years.

353
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:53,491
Not since...

354
00:23:54,042 --> 00:23:55,475
Middle of our sophomore year?

355
00:23:56,498 --> 00:23:57,648
That's right.

356
00:23:59,753 --> 00:24:02,703
You had a devil on your shoulder
even back then.

357
00:24:06,686 --> 00:24:08,936
All right, now, let it all sink in.

358
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:10,773
You son of a bitch.

359
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,357
You introduced me to Jess!

360
00:24:13,482 --> 00:24:14,831
I think he's got it!

361
00:24:14,956 --> 00:24:16,621
- Damn it, Sam!
- I'm gonna kill you!

362
00:24:24,816 --> 00:24:25,838
That's enough!

363
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,010
Get out of my way!

364
00:24:30,084 --> 00:24:31,360
Get out of my way.

365
00:24:31,485 --> 00:24:34,555
There is only one way to win,
and it ain't by killing that thing.

366
00:24:35,737 --> 00:24:38,737
Well... Sounds like
you got him nice and fluffed.

367
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,270
Thanks so much.

368
00:24:42,588 --> 00:24:43,738
Listen to me.

369
00:24:44,141 --> 00:24:47,610
We need Pestilence to get at the devil,
and we need Brady to get to Pestilence.

370
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:48,904
Why?

371
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,530
Because Crowley said so?

372
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:53,491
We trust him now?
Like I trusted Ruby?

373
00:24:53,948 --> 00:24:55,910
Or like I trusted Brady
back at school?

374
00:25:04,665 --> 00:25:05,665
Look...

375
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:07,899
Do the math yourself.

376
00:25:08,415 --> 00:25:09,715
If Lucifer wins,

377
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:12,718
he'll turn this place
into his kingdom.

378
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:15,607
When the morning star cleans house,

379
00:25:15,732 --> 00:25:16,889
we all get the mop.

380
00:25:19,141 --> 00:25:20,341
He created us.

381
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:23,187
Why would he destroy us?

382
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,855
That makes no sense.

383
00:25:25,335 --> 00:25:26,535
Look at who...

384
00:25:27,822 --> 00:25:29,709
At what he is.

385
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,530
Then take a look at what we are.

386
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:37,257
Maybe you should be
a little less worried about ournecks

387
00:25:37,382 --> 00:25:39,982
and be a little more worried
about yours.

388
00:25:40,574 --> 00:25:42,074
Has crossed my mind.

389
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:46,203
- That's not really the point.
- Actually, Crowley, that is the point.

390
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:47,334
No one

391
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:49,338
will know greater torment

392
00:25:49,463 --> 00:25:50,463
than you.

393
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,310
Lucifer

394
00:25:52,622 --> 00:25:54,472
is never gonna let you die.

395
00:25:56,854 --> 00:25:58,754
As for me, I know the score.

396
00:25:58,879 --> 00:26:02,555
I'm dead,
whether I tell you anything or not.

397
00:26:03,621 --> 00:26:06,571
So I think I'll die
on the winning side, thanks.

398
00:26:10,867 --> 00:26:11,867
Good talk.

399
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,821
Cheers.

400
00:26:30,617 --> 00:26:32,506
How'd it go?
He buy your girl scout cookies?

401
00:26:32,902 --> 00:26:33,902
Not yet.

402
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:37,261
Where's your moose?

403
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:39,931
He's cooling off.

404
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,433
All right, then.

405
00:26:43,396 --> 00:26:44,396
Get bent.

406
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:47,854
- You going somewhere?
- Well, he won't budge.

407
00:26:47,979 --> 00:26:49,607
So now I go stick my neck out.

408
00:26:52,498 --> 00:26:53,769
What are you gonna do?

409
00:26:53,894 --> 00:26:56,739
Exactly the kind of swashbuckle
I've been trying to avoid.

410
00:26:57,647 --> 00:26:59,047
Now I go kick open

411
00:26:59,172 --> 00:27:00,522
a hive of demons.

412
00:27:07,822 --> 00:27:10,211
This whole bloody ring business
better work.

413
00:27:40,437 --> 00:27:41,587
Sam, come on!

414
00:27:47,093 --> 00:27:48,293
Open the door!

415
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:57,608
Well, here we go.

416
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:02,311
We doing last words or no?

417
00:28:02,866 --> 00:28:04,366
Sophomore year, huh?

418
00:28:09,227 --> 00:28:11,188
Brady, here, he was a good kid.

419
00:28:11,554 --> 00:28:14,525
Straight arrow.
I mean, your best friend, really.

420
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,480
Perfect point of access.

421
00:28:17,804 --> 00:28:19,704
- Thanksgiving.
- Yes, sir.

422
00:28:20,392 --> 00:28:22,871
Remember when I came back
from break all messed up.

423
00:28:22,996 --> 00:28:25,119
Dropped out of pre-med,
the drugs, the bitches?

424
00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:28,914
That was the new Brady. That was me.

425
00:28:31,514 --> 00:28:33,450
Remember how much time you spent

426
00:28:33,575 --> 00:28:35,379
trying to get me back
on the right track?

427
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:38,883
You really were a good friend.

428
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:43,717
But ol' yellow eyes
didn't send me back to be your friend.

429
00:28:43,842 --> 00:28:45,514
No, we were starting to lose you.

430
00:28:46,342 --> 00:28:49,792
You were becoming a mild-mannered,
worthless sack of piss.

431
00:28:50,557 --> 00:28:52,819
Now, come on. We couldn't have that.

432
00:28:52,944 --> 00:28:54,544
You were our favorite.

433
00:28:58,114 --> 00:29:00,564
So I hooked you up
with a pure, sweet,

434
00:29:00,961 --> 00:29:02,611
innocent piece of tail.

435
00:29:04,396 --> 00:29:06,846
And then I toasted her
on the ceiling.

436
00:29:10,321 --> 00:29:12,833
That's right. Azel might have
put the hit out on Jessica,

437
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,461
but, man, I got to have all the fun!

438
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,089
You know,

439
00:29:18,537 --> 00:29:20,687
she thought we were friends, too.

440
00:29:21,864 --> 00:29:22,927
Let me right in.

441
00:29:24,022 --> 00:29:25,672
She was baking cookies.

442
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,949
She was so surprised...

443
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:32,937
So hurt

444
00:29:33,364 --> 00:29:35,114
when I started in on her.

445
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,193
Do it if it'll make you feel better!

446
00:29:40,504 --> 00:29:42,454
Do it, Sammy! Do it! Come on!

447
00:30:01,502 --> 00:30:02,502


448
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,308
Come on.

449
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:13,519
All right! Wait! I'm gonna open it.

450
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:18,273
- What happened?
- Nothing.

451
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:20,298
- My ass.
- Dean, I'm fine.

452
00:30:20,575 --> 00:30:21,925
What about Brady?

453
00:30:24,402 --> 00:30:25,702
Like you said...

454
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:27,766
We need him.

455
00:30:28,962 --> 00:30:30,562
God. The day I've had!

456
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:37,083
Good news.

457
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,161
You're going to live forever.

458
00:30:41,477 --> 00:30:42,777
What did you do?

459
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,520
Went over to a demons' nest.
Had a little massacre.

460
00:30:48,624 --> 00:30:50,724
Must be losing my touch, though.

461
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,189
Let one of the little toads live.

462
00:30:55,726 --> 00:30:57,885
Also might have given said toad

463
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,232
the impression
that you left your post last night

464
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,100
because you and I are...

465
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:04,195
Wait for it.

466
00:31:04,804 --> 00:31:06,594
Lovers in league

467
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:08,134
against Satan.

468
00:31:14,996 --> 00:31:16,207
Hello, darling.

469
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,336
So, now death is off the table.

470
00:31:20,917 --> 00:31:24,632
Now you get to be on the boss's
eternal-torment list with little old me.

471
00:31:27,642 --> 00:31:30,721
Something else we have in common.
Apart from our torrid passion.

472
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,389
Craven self-preservation.

473
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:35,768
So, now, why don't you tell me

474
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,586
where Pestilence is at?

475
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,223
God, Crowley.

476
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,840
Was that a hellhound?

477
00:31:53,685 --> 00:31:55,996
- I'd say yeah.
- Why was that a hellhound?

478
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,210
- What's that?
- Remember my crafty tracking device?

479
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,796
Demons planted one on me.

480
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,757
You're saying a hellhound
followed you here?

481
00:32:07,046 --> 00:32:09,306
- Technically, he followed this.
- Get me out of here.

482
00:32:09,431 --> 00:32:11,207
- I'll tell you anything.
- Shut up.

483
00:32:11,332 --> 00:32:13,042
- We should go.
- Sorry, boys.

484
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:14,890
No one knows more
about the hounds than I.

485
00:32:15,288 --> 00:32:17,538
You're long past the point of "go."

486
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,482
- Damn it.
- I told you!

487
00:32:23,778 --> 00:32:24,928
Good for you.

488
00:32:25,705 --> 00:32:27,987
Luckily,
we have salt in the kitchen.

489
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,462
I'll watch Brady.

490
00:32:30,136 --> 00:32:31,136
Watch me?

491
00:32:32,061 --> 00:32:34,863
Get me the hell out of here!

492
00:33:11,894 --> 00:33:12,894
Salt?

493
00:33:16,243 --> 00:33:18,843
- Damn it, get me out of here!
- Shut up!

494
00:33:18,968 --> 00:33:20,368
Great. Just great.

495
00:33:26,853 --> 00:33:28,903
- You're back?
- I'm invested.

496
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,480
Currently.

497
00:33:31,012 --> 00:33:32,012
Stay!

498
00:33:33,936 --> 00:33:36,305
- You can control them?
- Not that one.

499
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,629
I brought my own.

500
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:42,428
Mine's bigger.

501
00:33:43,915 --> 00:33:44,980
Sic him, boy!

502
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:15,355
I'll wager $1,000 my pup wins.

503
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,512
I'm sure Pestilence will be there.
Thanks.

504
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,986
- What do you think?
- It's good.

505
00:34:44,979 --> 00:34:46,625
You got no reason to lie, have you?

506
00:34:47,535 --> 00:34:48,585
Like I said,

507
00:34:49,085 --> 00:34:50,254
you're in my boat now.

508
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:53,132
You've screwed me. For eternity.

509
00:34:55,223 --> 00:34:56,773
Won't last that long.

510
00:34:56,923 --> 00:34:57,923
Trust me.

511
00:34:58,784 --> 00:35:00,284
Where are you going?

512
00:35:01,531 --> 00:35:02,531
I'm going

513
00:35:02,871 --> 00:35:04,271
to do you a favor.

514
00:35:07,483 --> 00:35:09,333
I expect we'll be in touch.

515
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:34,465
What is this?

516
00:35:35,222 --> 00:35:36,572
All those angels,

517
00:35:36,697 --> 00:35:39,052
all those demons,
all those sons of bitches...

518
00:35:39,331 --> 00:35:40,888
They don't get it, do they, Sammy?

519
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,891
No, they don't, Dean.

520
00:35:44,831 --> 00:35:45,893
You see, Brady...

521
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,561
We're the ones
you should be afraid of.

522
00:35:53,283 --> 00:35:56,083
I bet this is a real moment for you,
big boy.

523
00:35:57,143 --> 00:35:59,193
Gonna make you feel all better?

524
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,950
It's a start.

525
00:36:02,762 --> 00:36:06,736
Gonna make up for all the times
that we yanked your chain?

526
00:36:07,549 --> 00:36:09,149
Yellow eyes, Ruby, me?

527
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,194
But it wasn't all our fault, was it?

528
00:36:12,919 --> 00:36:14,741
You're the one who trusted us.

529
00:36:14,866 --> 00:36:16,769
You're the one
who let us into your life,

530
00:36:16,894 --> 00:36:18,400
let us whisper in your ear

531
00:36:18,525 --> 00:36:20,475
over and over and over again.

532
00:36:21,129 --> 00:36:22,830
Ever wonder why that is, Sammy?

533
00:36:22,955 --> 00:36:25,805
Ever wonder why
we were so in your blind spot?

534
00:36:27,274 --> 00:36:30,524
Maybe it's because
we got the same stuff in our veins.

535
00:36:31,924 --> 00:36:33,023
And deep down,

536
00:36:33,306 --> 00:36:35,698
you know you're just like us.

537
00:36:47,034 --> 00:36:49,373
Maybe you hate us so much

538
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,375
because you hate what you see
every time

539
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,627
you look in the mirror.
You ever think of that?

540
00:36:55,388 --> 00:36:59,187
Maybe the only difference
between you and a demon

541
00:37:00,443 --> 00:37:01,543
is your hell

542
00:37:01,837 --> 00:37:03,037
is right here.

543
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:20,946
Interesting theory.

544
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:38,464


545
00:37:38,602 --> 00:37:40,102
Yeah, I followed up.

546
00:37:40,518 --> 00:37:41,618
Nasty omens,

547
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:45,040
but none of it's death
with a capital D.

548
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,781
Just give me a ring
if it turns into anything.

549
00:37:50,414 --> 00:37:51,564
And, Rufus...

550
00:37:52,383 --> 00:37:54,333
You watch your ass out there.

551
00:37:57,023 --> 00:37:58,873
Chin up. Cavalry's arrived.

552
00:38:01,521 --> 00:38:02,521
Charming.

553
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,780
That won't work on me.

554
00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:06,549
Name's Crowley.

555
00:38:06,874 --> 00:38:08,772
- Maybe you've...
- You're Crowley?

556
00:38:08,897 --> 00:38:10,147
In the flesh...

557
00:38:10,272 --> 00:38:12,105
Of a moderately successful

558
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,832
literary agent out of New York.

559
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:21,943
I see you have heard of me.

560
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,219
- I liked this suit.
- What are you doing here?

561
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,555
- Looking out for Crowley.
- Meaning?

562
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,950
The boys are onto ring number 3,

563
00:38:33,075 --> 00:38:34,925
but we still need number 4.

564
00:38:37,418 --> 00:38:38,768
I'm here to help.

565
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:44,029
You know where Death is?

566
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,168
Haven't the foggiest.

567
00:38:53,048 --> 00:38:55,113
Then get the hell off my property

568
00:38:55,238 --> 00:38:58,752
before I blast you so full of rock salt,
you crap margaritas.

569
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,379
That's a mite unfriendly,

570
00:39:00,695 --> 00:39:03,071
seeing as I could be getting you
Death's location

571
00:39:03,196 --> 00:39:04,758
in the time it'd take you to reload.

572
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,957
You're just gonna
chat some demons up

573
00:39:07,082 --> 00:39:08,762
and hope they don't recognize you?

574
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,722
God, no. That could get me killed.

575
00:39:11,412 --> 00:39:14,854
But there is
this little spell that I know.

576
00:39:15,914 --> 00:39:18,514
- That so?
- Results are 100% guaranteed.

577
00:39:19,265 --> 00:39:21,149
Then why are you snake-oiling me?

578
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:23,031
Well,

579
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,028
it's a little bit...

580
00:39:26,018 --> 00:39:27,168
Embarrassing.

581
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,375
There's this technicality.

582
00:39:33,301 --> 00:39:35,414
I need a little something
to get the magic going.

583
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,082
And what's that?

584
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,380
You make a wish.

585
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:41,335
I can give you anything you want.

586
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,010
Up to and including
Death's coordinates.

587
00:39:44,505 --> 00:39:46,949
- All I need is...
- My soul.

588
00:39:47,506 --> 00:39:48,844
I've done more with less.

589
00:39:49,229 --> 00:39:51,218
Let's say
when they're getting their grammys,

590
00:39:51,343 --> 00:39:52,973
they shouldn't all be thanking God.

591
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,275
It's worth it, bobby.

592
00:39:57,457 --> 00:39:58,457
Think.

593
00:40:05,557 --> 00:40:06,945
Here's my counter.

594
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:11,273
Bloody hell!

595
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:13,319
Feisty.

596
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:15,287
Get out.

597
00:40:15,801 --> 00:40:17,372
I'll give it right back.

598
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,790
You think I'm a natural-born eejit?

599
00:40:19,915 --> 00:40:21,084
Quite the contrary.

600
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,552
Look, you're right to be suspicious.

601
00:40:24,492 --> 00:40:25,892
But I'm your ally.

602
00:40:26,084 --> 00:40:28,134
Enemy of my enemy and all that.

603
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,877
I need the devil back in his stock.

604
00:40:31,002 --> 00:40:34,005
In fact, my delicate ass
depends on it.

605
00:40:38,983 --> 00:40:40,183
I promise you.

606
00:40:40,497 --> 00:40:41,747
Temporary loan.

607
00:40:42,346 --> 00:40:43,596
I'll give it...

608
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:44,771
Right back.
