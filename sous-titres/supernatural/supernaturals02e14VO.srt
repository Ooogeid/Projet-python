1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,310
Dad wants us to pick up where he left off

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,700
Saving people, hunting things, 
the family business. 

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,480
"THEN"

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,670
My dad had a partneron his last hunt. 

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,250
The guy screwed up, got my dad killed. 

6
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,320
- What does this have to do  
- It was your father, Dean. 

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,970
Maybe that's what the demon's doing...  
pushing us, finding ways to break us. 

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:16,730
I'm meg. 

9
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,040
She's possessed...   
a human possessed by a demon. 

10
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,550
Key of Solomon...   
you get a demon in one, they're trapped, powerless. 

11
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,200
Before dad died, he told something...  
something about you. 

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,360
He said that I had to save you,
and if I couldn't, I'd have to kill you. 

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,860
Did he know the demon's plans for me ? 

14
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,580
Am I supposed to go dark side ? 

15
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,440
I never said that. 

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,190
You're not careful,
you will have to waste me one day, Dean. 

17
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,480
"NOW"

18
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,880
Ellen, it's me again. 

19
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,470
Any chance you've heard from him ? 

20
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,090
I swear, it's like looking
for my dad all over again. 

21
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,700
I'm losing my mind here. 

22
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,190
I've called hima thousand times. 

23
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,240
It's nothing but voice mail. 

24
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,990
I don't know where he wentor why. 

25
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,640
Sam's just gone. 

26
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,780
Hang on. 

27
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,440
Sammy, where the hell are you ? 

28
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,380
Are you okay ? 

29
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,210
Hey, hey, hey, hey. 

30
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:08,890
Calm down. 

31
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:09,610
Where are you ? 

32
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,210
Don't move. 

33
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,380
I'm on my way. 

34
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,930
Sam, it's me. 

35
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,680
Sam ! 

36
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,030
Sam ? 

37
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,560
Hey. 

38
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,030
Hey, Dean. 

39
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,530
Are you bleeding ? 

40
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,670
I tried to wash it off. 

41
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:03,990
Oh, my god. 

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,270
I don't think it's my blood. 

43
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,050
Whose is it ? 

44
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,100
I don't know. 

45
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,620
Sam, what the hell happened ? 

46
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,480
Dean...  

47
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,350
I don't remember anything.

Season 2 Episode 14</font>

51
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,610
What did you find out ? 

52
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,630
You checked in two days ago 
under the name Richard Sambora. 

53
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,320
I think the scariest part about this whole 
thing is the fact that you're a Bon Jovi fan. 

54
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,220
Dean. 

55
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,550
Your room's been quiet. 

56
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,080
Nobody's noticed anything unusual. 

57
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,080
You mean no one saw me walking 
around covered in blood ? 

58
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,100
Yeah, that's what I mean. 

59
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,830
Then how the hell did I get here ? 

60
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,600
What happened to me ? 

61
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,580
<font color=#38B0DE>"BORN UNDER A BAD SIGN"</font>

62
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,280
I don't know, but you're okay, 
and that's what matters. 

63
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,050
Everything else, we can deal with. 

64
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:57,960
Oh, really ? 

65
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,440
'Cause what if I hurt someone or worse ? 

66
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,610
Sam. 

67
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,530
What if this is 
what dad warned you about ? 

68
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,490
Come on, man. 

69
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,500
Let's not jump the gun here. 

70
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,850
We don't know what happened. 

71
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,910
We got to treat this like any other job. 

72
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,400
What's the last thing you remember ? 

73
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,040
Me and you in that motel room in west Texas. 

74
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,390
We went out to grab some burgers. 

75
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,700
West Texas... that was over a week ago. 

76
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,270
That's it. 

77
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,430
Next thing I knew, I was sitting here...  

78
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,890
Bloody. 

79
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,340
I felt like I had been a sleep for a month. 

80
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,140
Okay, retrace your steps. 

81
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,110
Manager said you left yesterday 
afternoon and never saw you come back. 

82
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,240
Hey. 

83
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,620
Recognize anything ? 

84
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,440
Not really. 

85
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,400
Wait. 

86
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:08,770
What ? 

87
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,960
I think I was here. 

88
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,070
You remember ? 

89
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,590
Not really. It just...  

90
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,200
Feels familiar, you know ? 

91
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,900
Try that one. 

92
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:27,760
Yeah. 

93
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,130
Okay. 

94
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,110
Wait. 

95
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,530
Please tell me you didn't steal this. 

96
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,610
More blood. 

97
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,370
Sam, backseat. 

98
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,700
You think I used this on someone ? 

99
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,590
I'm not thinking anything. 

100
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,500
Okay, now, this is disturbing. 

101
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,270
Come on, man. 

102
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,480
This couldn't have been you. 

103
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,360
It could have beensomeone else...
somebody who, uh, smokes menthols. 

104
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,510
Hey, a gas receipt, a few towns over. 

105
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,100
All right, receipt's for10 gallons at pump number 2. 

106
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,470
You getting any goose bumps yet ? 

107
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,790
"God, this looks familiar, "déj ? vu vibes ? 

108
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,790
Maybe someone inside will remember you. 

109
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,670
Come on. 

110
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,210
You... out of here. 

111
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:16,760
Now. 

112
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,740
I'm calling the cops. 

113
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,650
You talking to him ? 

114
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,900
Yeah, I'm talking to him. 

115
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,240
Jerk comes in yesterday, stinking drunk, 
grabs a 40 from the fridge, starts chugging it. 

116
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,930
This guy ? 

117
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,330
You're drinking malt liquor ? 

118
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,080
Not after he whipped 
the bottleat my friggin' head. 

119
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,240
This guy ? 

120
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,970
What, am I speaking urdu ? 

121
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,270
- I'm really sorry if I did anything 
- Tell your story walking, pal, okay ? 

122
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,260
Popo will be here in five. 

123
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:36,820
Wait. 

124
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,780
He's leaving. 

125
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,740
Put the phone down. 

126
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,090
Sam, go wait in the car. 

127
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,660
- But, Dean  
- Go wait in the car ! 

128
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,670
Okay, look, I just want to talk to you,
that's it, okay ? 

129
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,550
When he took off yesterday,
which way did he go ? 

130
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,710
Why don't you ask him ? 

131
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,060
'Cause I'm asking you. 

132
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,660
Please, you'd be doing me a huge favor, okay ? 

133
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,310
Oh, do you a favor. 

134
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,310
Well, that is what I live for. 

135
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,690
You know, your buddy didn't pay for the booze 
or the smokes, which he also illegally lit up. 

136
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,840
You saw him smoking ? 

137
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,440
Yeah, guy's a chimney. 

138
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,530
This, uh...  

139
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,820
Ought to cover it. 

140
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,830
Hmm, it's,uh, it's coming back to me now. 

141
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,780
He took two packs. 

142
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,750
Of course he did. 

143
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,790
Heent north on route 71, straight out of town. 

144
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,280
What's going on with you, Sam, hmm ? 

145
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,460
The smoking, throwing bottles at people...
that sounds more like methan you. 

146
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,210
Dean, wait. 

147
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,360
Wait. Here. 

148
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,370
Turn down that road. 

149
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:00,850
What ? 

150
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,450
I don't know how I know. 

151
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,390
I just do. 

152
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,000
Who ever lives here, I'd say 
they don't like surprises. 

153
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,890
Should we knock ? 

154
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,990
Yeah,I guess. 

155
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,440
Hey, Dean. 

156
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,430
I'm surprised the copsdidn't show...
place like this you'd think would have an alarm. 

157
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,050
Yeah, you would. 

158
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,170
Hit the lights. 

159
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,040
Dean, I did this. 

160
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,810
We don't know that. 

161
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,860
What else do you need ? 

162
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,820
How else do you explain the car,
the knife, the blood ? 

163
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,320
I don't know, man. 

164
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,540
Why don't you tell me ? 

165
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,570
Even if you did do this, I'm sure you had a reason... you know, 
self-defense, he was a bad son of a bitch... something. 

166
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,260
He doesn't have any I. D. 

167
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,780
I need your lock pick. 

168
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,430
What ? 

169
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,680
I need your lock pick. 

170
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,000
Either this guy'sa unabomber... or a hunter. 

171
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,370
Dean, I think I killed a hunter. 

172
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,790
Let's find out. 

173
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,810
Here we go. 

174
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,750
How do you erase this, huh ? 

175
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,920
Sam, come on. 

176
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,110
I need your help. 

177
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,590
I killed him, Dean. 

178
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,540
I just broke in and killed him. 

179
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,930
Listen to me. 

180
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,380
Who ever this guy is, he's a hunter, which means 
other huntersare gonna look for his killer,

181
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,590
which means we got to cover 
our tracks, okay ? 

182
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,530
His name was Steve Wandell. 

183
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,930
This is a letter from his daughter. 

184
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,620
Wipe your prints. Then we go. 

185
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,190
All right, we get a couple hours' sleep,
and then we put this place in our rearview mirror. 

186
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,720
I know this is bad, okay ? 

187
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,730
You got to snap out of it. 

188
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,590
Sam, say something. 

189
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,570
Just get some sleep and leave in the morning ? 

190
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,410
Murder, Dean... that's what I did. 

191
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,760
Maybe, okay ? 

192
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,470
Hey, we don't... shapeshifter. 

193
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,580
Oh, come on. 

194
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,240
You know it wasn't. 

195
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,930
You saw the tape. 

196
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,480
There was no eye flare, no distortion. 

197
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,560
But it wasn't you, all right ? 

198
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,240
Yeah, it might have been you, but it wasn't you. 

199
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,090
Well, I think it was. 

200
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,300
I think maybe more than you know. 

201
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,890
What the hell does that mean ? 

202
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,090
For the last few weeks, I've been having...  

203
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,450
I've been having these feelings. 

204
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,310
What feelings ? 

205
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,360
Rage...  

206
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,730
Hate. 

207
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,100
And I can't stop it. 

208
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,940
It just gets worse. 

209
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,650
Day by day, it gets worse. 

210
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,260
You never told me this. 

211
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,650
I didn't want to scare you. 

212
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,330
Well, bang-up job on that. 

213
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,610
Dean,the yellow-eyed demon... 
you know he has plansfor me. 

214
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,620
And we both know that he's turned 
other children into killers before, too. 

215
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,380
No one can control you but you. 

216
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,340
It sure doesn't seem like that, Dean. 

217
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,850
It feels like no matter what I do,
slowly but surely, I'm just becoming... what ? 

218
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,730
Who I'm meant to be. 

219
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,020
You said it once yourself, Dean. 

220
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,220
I got to face up to who I am. 

221
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,100
I didn't mean this ! 

222
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,450
But it's still true. 

223
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,670
You know that. 

224
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,730
Dad knew that, too. 

225
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,970
That's why he told you 
if it ever came to this

226
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:46,920
shut up, Sam. 

227
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,720
Dean, you promised him. 

228
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,690
You promised me. 

229
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,350
No. 

230
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,400
Listen to me. 

231
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,920
We're gonna figure this out, okay ? 

232
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,120
I mean, there's got to be a way, right ? 

233
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,530
Yeah, there is. 

234
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,050
I don't want to hurt anyone else. 

235
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,580
I don't want to hurt you. 

236
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,230
You won't. 

237
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,570
Whatever this is, you can fight it. 

238
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,750
No,I can't...  

239
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,710
Not forever. 

240
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,780
Here. You got to do it. 

241
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,380
You know,
I've tried so hard to keep you safe. 

242
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,940
I know. 

243
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:05,710
I can't. 

244
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,260
I'd rather die. 

245
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,940
No. 

246
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,330
You'll live. 

247
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,090
You'll live to regret this. 

248
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,960
It's past your check out. 

249
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,220
What ? 

250
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,320
It's past checko ut, and I have 
a couple here that need your room. 

251
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,940
Yeah, I'll bet they do. 

252
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,430
What time is it ? 

253
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,600
12:30. 

254
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,340
The guy that was with me... 
have you seen him ? 

255
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:37,030
Yeah, he left before dawnin your car, and you should 
have gone with him because now 
I'm gonna have to charge you extra. 

256
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,270
Oh, son of a bitch. 

257
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,660
It's just policy, Sir. 

258
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,280
I need to use your computer. 

259
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,960
Why would I let you use my computer ? 

260
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,160
Hi. 

261
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,570
Uh, so sorry to bother you, but, uh, 
my son snuck out of the house last night and,

262
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,080
uh, went to a just in timberlake concert. 

263
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,030
What ? 

264
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:00,770
Yeah. 

265
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,810
Justin is quite the triple threat. 

266
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,790
Uh, anyway, he's not back yet,
and I'm starting to worry. 

267
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,520
Right, yeah, boys will be boys. 

268
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,790
But, see, Sammy is A...  

269
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,100
diabetic, and if he doesn't get
his insulin, then I just... I have to find him. 

270
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,270
Please, I'm begging you. 

271
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,390
No, no, no, I'm on the web site right now. 

272
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,620
I just need to activate the gps on his cellphone. 

273
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,120
Yeah, right there. 

274
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,680
Duluth, Minnesota. 

275
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,800
Yeah, that is a long way to go for a concert. 

276
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,900
I appreciate your help. 

277
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:42,870
Night. 

278
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,940
Thank you. 

279
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
Sorry, we're closing up. 

280
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,450
How about just one for the road ? 

281
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,220
Well, you're about the last 
person I'd expect to see. 

282
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,760
Well...  

283
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,990
I guess I'm full of surprises. 

284
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,950
So, can I get a beer ? 

285
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,930
Sure. 

286
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,630
One beer. 

287
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,330
So, how'd you find me ? 

288
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,750
Well, uh, it's kind of what we do, you know ? 

289
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,620
Speaking of "we, "where's Dean ? 

290
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,910
Couldn't make it. 

291
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,980
So, what are youdoing here, Sam ? 

292
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,050
We didn't exactly part on the best of terms. 

293
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,620
Right. 

294
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,690
That's why I'm here. 

295
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,560
I kind of wanted to see 
if we could square things, you know ? 

296
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,680
That looks like it hurts. 

297
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:57,540
No. 

298
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:58,940
No, just...  

299
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,580
Had a run-inwith a hot stove. 

300
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,650
So, you were saying something 
about squaring things ? 

301
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,670
Yeah. 

302
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:15,010
Look,I know how you feel about my dad,
and I can't say I blame you. 

303
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:22,840
He was obsessed, consumed with hunting, 
and he didn't care who got caught in the cross fire. 

304
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,040
And I guess that included your dad. 

305
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,440
But that was my father. 

306
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,720
That's not me. 

307
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,990
What about dean ? 

308
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:38,950
Well, Dean's more like 
my father than I am, but he...  

309
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,360
Boy...  

310
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,670
you're really carrying a torch for him, aren't you ? 

311
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,820
I'll take that as a yes. 

312
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,140
It's too bad. 

313
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,170
'Cause, see, Dean, he likes you, sure, but...  

314
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,650
not in the way you'd want. 

315
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:11,640
I mean, maybe as kind of a little sister,
but romance... that's just out of the question. 

316
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,800
He kind of thinks you're a school
girl, you know ? 

317
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,940
I'm not trying to hurt you, Jo. 

318
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,600
I... I'm telling you'cause I care. 

319
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,290
That's real kind of you, Sam. 

320
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,370
I mean it. 

321
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,830
I care about you a lot. 

322
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,100
Sam, what's going on ? 

323
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,190
I can be more to you, Jo. 

324
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,940
Maybe you should leave. 

325
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,550
Okay. 

326
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,980
Sam, get off me ! 

327
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,740
Sam, get off me ! 

328
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,800
Let go. 

329
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,750
Jo, Jo, Jo. 

330
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,940
Sam, no, please ! 

331
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,760
Please. 

332
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,340
It didn't have to be this way. 

333
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,450
Maybe it did. 

334
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:53,260
*before you slip into unconsciousness*

335
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,890
what the hell's going on ? 

336
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:56,940
What are you doing ? 

337
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:02,260
So, what exactly did your mom tell 
you about how your dad died ? 

338
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,080
You're not Sam. 

339
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,390
Don't be so sure about that. 

340
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,420
Answer the question... 

341
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:13,860
Come on. 

342
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,400
It's me. 

343
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:18,940
You can tell me anything. 

344
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,060
You know that. 

345
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,450
Answer the question. 

346
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,240
Fine. 

347
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,370
Fine. 

348
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,740
Our dads were in california...
devil's gate reservoir. 

349
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,140
They were setting a trap
for some kind of hell spawn. 

350
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,630
John was hiding, waiting, and my dad was bait. 

351
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,950
That's just like John. 

352
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,270
Oh,I bet he dangled 
Bill like meat on a hook. 

353
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,060
Then what ? 

354
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,050
The thing showed up. 

355
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,880
John got too eager, jumped out too soon, 
got my dad exposed out in the open. 

356
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,110
The thing turned around...  

357
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,310
and killed him. 

358
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,690
Not quite. 

359
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,600
What ? 

360
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,610
What ? 

361
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,820
See, it hurt him. 

362
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,250
It didn't kill him. 

363
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,690
You really don't know the truth, do you ? 

364
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,120
I bet your mom doesn't, either. 

365
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,350
Know what ? 

366
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,700
You see, Bill...  

367
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,480
was all clawed up. 

368
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,950
He was holding his insidesin his hands. 

369
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,530
He was gargling and...  

370
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,030
praying to see you and ellenone more time. 

371
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,890
So my dad...  

372
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,510
killed him. 

373
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,730
He put him out of his misery like a sick dog. 

374
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,330
You're lying. 

375
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:50,770
I'm not. 

376
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:51,760
It's true. 

377
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,570
My daddy shot your daddy in the head

378
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:56,900
how could you know that ? 

379
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,870
I hear things. 

380
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,480
Why are you doing this to me ? 

381
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,710
Like daddy, like daughter. 

382
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,450
You're bait. 

383
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,280
Open up. 

384
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,970
That's a girl. 

385
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,070
Sam ! 

386
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,400
I begged you to stop me, Dean ! 

387
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,510
Put the knife down, damn it. 

388
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,190
I told you I can't fight it ! 

389
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,960
My head feels like it's on fire, all right ? 

390
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,200
Dean, kill me, or I'm gonna kill her. 

391
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,020
Please. 

392
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,200
You'd be doing me a favor. 

393
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,720
Shoot me. 

394
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,160
Shoot me ! 

395
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,780
No, Sammy. Come on. 

396
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,190
What the hell's wrong with you, Dean ? 

397
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,710
Are you that scared of being alone 
that you'd rather let Jo die ? 

398
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,130
That's holy water, you demonic son of a bitch ! 

399
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,800
He was possessed ? 

400
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Dean ! 

401
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,200
- So, who are you ? 
- I got lots of names. 

402
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,800
You've been in sam since he
disappeared, haven't you ? 

403
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:55,600
Should have seen your face when you thought
he murdered that guy. Pathetic. 

404
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,900
Why didn't you kill me ? 
You had a dozen chances. 

405
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,100
No, that would have been too easy. 
Where's the fun in that ? 

406
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,000
See, this was a test. I wanted to see
if I could push you far enough to waste Sam. 

407
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,200
I should have known you wouldn't have the sack. 

408
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,700
Anyway, fun's over now. 

409
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,000
Well,I hope you got your kicks
'cause you're gonna pay hell for this. 

410
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:34,900
How ? You can't hurt me...
not without hurting your little brother. 

411
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:44,500
See,I think you're gonna die, Dean...
you and every other hunter I can find. 

412
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:52,100
One look at Sam's dewy, sensitive eyes,
and they'll let me right in that door. 

413
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,600
This is dean. Leave a message. 

414
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,900
Dean ! 

415
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,900
Dean ! 

416
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,500
Take it easy. 

417
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,100
- Where's Sam ? 
- I don't know. I've been looking for you. 

418
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,800
Come on. Get up. 

419
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,100
Okay. Don't be a baby ! 

420
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,200
God. 

421
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,200
All right, almost. All right, got it. Got it. 

422
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,200
- God, you're a butcher. 
- You're welcome. 

423
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,900
- All right, are we done ? 
- Would you give me two minutes to patch you up ? 

424
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,800
You can't help sam if you're bleeding to death. 

425
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,700
So, how did you know that he was possessed ? 

426
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,400
I didn't. I just knew that
it couldn't have been him. 

427
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,700
- Hey, Dean. 
- Yeah. 

428
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,100
I know demons lie,
but do they ever tell the truth, too ? 

429
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,700
Yeah, sometimes, I guess, especially
if they know it'll mess with your head. 

430
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,300
Why do you ask ? 

431
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,700
Nothing. It doesn't matter. 

432
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,900
So, do you have any idea
where he's headed to next ? 

433
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:05,300
So far, he's been going after the nearest hunter,
so, the closest one I know is in south Dakota. 

434
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,600
Okay, good. I'm done. Let's go. 

435
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,600
- You're not coming. 
- The hell I'm not. I'm a part of this now. 

436
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:19,000
I can't say it more plain than this 
you try and follow me,
and I'll tie you right back to that post. 

437
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,200
This is my fight. I'm not getting
your blood on my hands. 

438
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,000
That's just how it's gonna be. 

439
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,600
Wait. Here. 

440
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,300
Take these. They'll help with the pain. 

441
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,400
Thanks. 

442
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,800
I'll call you later, okay ? 

443
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,400
No,you won't. 

444
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,200
Damn it. 

445
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,000
- Sam. 
- Hey, Bobby. 

446
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,600
It's been a while. Come on in. 

447
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:47,100
- So, what brings you ? 
- Working a job nearby, and I thought 
I'd stop in and say hey. 

448
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,300
Where's Dean ? 

449
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,200
Holed up somewhere with a girl and a 12-pack. 

450
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:59,500
- Oh, yeah ? Is she pretty ? 
- You ask me, he's in way over his head. 

451
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,600
Well, it's good to see you. 

452
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,600
To John. 

453
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,600
To dad. 

454
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,600
- What'd you do ? 
- Little holy water in the beer. 

455
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,100
Sam never would have noticed,
but, then, you're not Sam, are you ? 

456
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,300
Don't try to con a con man. 

457
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,100
Ugh ! 

458
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,500
Dean. Back from the dead. 

459
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,300
Getting to be a regular thing for you, isn't it ? 

460
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,200
Like a cock roach. 

461
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,900
How about I smack that smart-ass
right out of your mouth ? 

462
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Careful now. 

463
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:23,200
- Wouldn't want to bruise this fine packaging
- Oh, don't worry. This isn't gonna hurt Sam much. 

464
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,800
You, on the other hand...  

465
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,300
Feel like talking now ? 

466
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,000
Sam's still my meat puppet. 

467
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,700
- I'll make him bite off his tongue. 
- No, you won't be in him long enough. 

468
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,300
Bobby. 

469
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:56,500
Whatever bitch-boymaster plan you demons
are cooking up, you're not getting Sam, you understand me ? 

470
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,700
'Cause I'm gonna kill every one of you first. 

471
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:16,300
You really think that's what this is about
the master plan ? 

472
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,100
I don't give a rat's ass 
about the master plan. 

473
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,900
Oops. Doesn't seem to be working. 

474
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,600
See, I learned a few new tricks. 

475
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,200
This isn't going like I pictured. 
What's going on, Bobby ? 

476
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,500
It's a binding link ! 

477
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,500
It's like a lock. It's locked
it self inside Sam's body. 

478
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,100
- What the hell do we do ? 
- I don't know ! 

479
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,800
There. That's better. 

480
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,400
You know when people want to describe
the worst possible thing...  

481
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,800
they say it's like hell ? 

482
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,000
Well, there's a reason for that. 
Hell is like, uh...  

483
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,800
well, it's like hell, even for demons. 

484
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:49,600
It's a prison made of bone and
flesh and blood and fear. 

485
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,800
And you sent me back there. 

486
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:01,000
- Meg. 
- No... not anymore. 

487
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,900
Now I'm Sam. 

488
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,700
By the way...  

489
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,500
I saw your dad there. He says "howdy. "

490
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:18,200
All that I had to hold on to was that I would
climb out one day and that I was gonna torture you,

491
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,500
nice and slow, like pulling the wings off an insect. 

492
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,900
But whatever I do to you, it's nothing compared
to what you do to yourself, is it ? 

493
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,500
I can see it in your eyes, Dean. 

494
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,300
You're worthless. You couldn't save your dad

495
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,800
and deep down, you know that
you can't save your brother. 

496
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,900
They'd have been better off without you. 

497
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,600
Sammy ? 

498
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,800
Did I miss anything ? 

499
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,500
By the way, you really look like crap, Dean. 

500
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
Yeah, right back at you. 

501
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,500
What is it, Bobby ? 

502
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,600
You boys ever hear of a hunter
named Steve Wandell ? 

503
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,800
Why do you ask ? 

504
00:38:54,500 --> 00:39:00,500
Just heard from a friend, Wandell's dead
murdered in his own house. 

505
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,500
You wouldn't know anything about that. 

506
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,300
- No, Sir. Never heard of the guy. 
- Dean. 

507
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,900
Good. Keep it that way. 

508
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,800
Wandell's buddies are looking for
someone or something to string up. 

509
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,700
They're not gonna slow down to listen to reason. 

510
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,100
You understand what I'm saying ? 

511
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,500
We better hit the road...  

512
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,700
If, uh, you can remember where we parked the car. 

513
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,800
Here. Take these. 

514
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:35,400
- What are they ? 
- Charms. They'll fend off possession. 

515
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,700
That demon's still out there. This will
stop it from getting back up in you. 

516
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,700
- That sounds vaguely dirty, but, uh, thanks. 
- You're welcome. 

517
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,000
- You boys be careful, now. 
- You too. 

518
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,400
You okay ? 

519
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,700
Sam ? 

520
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,800
Is that you in there ? 

521
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,600
I was awake for some of it, Dean. 

522
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:38,300
I watched myself kill Wandell with my own two hands. 
I saw the light go out in his eyes. 

523
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,200
It must have been awful. 

524
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,600
That's not my point. 

525
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,700
I almost carved up Jo, too. 

526
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,500
But no matter what I did, you wouldn't shoot. 

527
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,600
It was the right move, Sam. It wasn't you. 

528
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,600
Yeah, this time. What about next time ? 

529
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:12,000
Sam, when dad told me that I might have to kill you,
it was only if I couldn't save you. 

530
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,500
Now, if it's the last thing I do,
I'm gonna save you. 

531
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:23,400
"I'm back on the road again I'm on my way "

532
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,400
What ? 

533
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,500
Nothing. 

534
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,500
Dean, what ? 

535
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:35,300
Dude, you, like, full-on had a girl inside you for,
like, a whole week. 

536
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,700
That's pretty naughty. 

537
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:45,100
"I'm on my way bye-bye - "
