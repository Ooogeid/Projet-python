1
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:07,963
- Who are you?
- Castiel.

2
00:00:08,046 --> 00:00:09,807
- What are you?
- I'm an angel of the lord.

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,636
- Some angel you are.
- My true form

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,162
It can be overwhelming to humans

5
00:00:14,571 --> 00:00:15,973
And so can my real voice...

6
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,963
But you already knew that.
Certain people... special people...

7
00:00:19,046 --> 00:00:22,104
- Can perceive my true visage.
- What visage are you in now, huh?

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,630
This? This is...

9
00:00:24,537 --> 00:00:26,776
- a vessel.
- You're possessing some poor bastard?

10
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:29,487
He's a devout man.
He actually prayed for this.

11
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,758
Something major must have
happened while I was downstairs,

12
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:34,367
'cause I can't back and
and you're bff with a demon?

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,579
- Why do you trust her so much?
- Because... she saved my life.

14
00:00:42,663 --> 00:00:44,833
Sucking blood?
You got to know that's wrong.

15
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,820
I wish to god I could stop.

16
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,570
We need to talk.

17
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:20,329
I'm dreaming, aren't I?

18
00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:22,244
It's not safe here.

19
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:26,607
- Someplace more private.
- More private? We're inside my head.

20
00:01:26,818 --> 00:01:27,837
Exactly.

21
00:01:28,529 --> 00:01:30,379
Someone could be listening.

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,210
Cass, what's wrong?

23
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,376
Meet me here.

24
00:01:35,087 --> 00:01:36,087
Go... now.

25
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:53,279
What'd he say, Dean?
What was so important?

26
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,070
If I knew, would I be here?

27
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,570
What the hell?

28
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:10,948
Looks like a bomb went off.

29
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:25,943
There was a fight here.

30
00:02:26,805 --> 00:02:27,988
Between who?

31
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:39,926
Check it out.

32
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:44,258
Look familiar?

33
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:46,059
Yeah, it does.

34
00:02:46,978 --> 00:02:48,517
Anna used something like that

35
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,200
To wish the angels
back to the cornfield.

36
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,337
So, what? Cass was fighting angels?

37
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,720
I don't know.

38
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:02,801
Sam.

39
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,960
Cass?

40
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,146
Cass! Hey! Cass!

41
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,565
What's... what's going on?

42
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:14,767
Just take it easy. Take it easy.

43
00:03:16,097 --> 00:03:17,347
Cass, you okay?

44
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:19,785
Castiel?

45
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:22,211
I'm not Castiel.

46
00:03:23,014 --> 00:03:24,014
It's me.

47
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,606
- Who's "me"?
- Jimmy.

48
00:03:28,862 --> 00:03:30,162
My name's Jimmy.

49
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,930
Where the hell is Castiel?

50
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:38,175
He's gone.

51
00:04:00,668 --> 00:04:03,187
Mind slowing down?
You're gonna give me angina.

52
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,320
I'm hungry.

53
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,500
When's the last time you ate?

54
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,270
I don't know... months.

55
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:24,040
What the hell happened back there?

56
00:04:24,123 --> 00:04:26,157
It looked like
an angel battle royal.

57
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,277
All I remember is there was
a flash of light, and I...

58
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,627
I woke up, and I was just,
you know, like, me again.

59
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,814
So, what Cass just ditched
out of your meat suit?

60
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:36,687
I really don't know.

61
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,823
You remember anything
about being possessed?

62
00:04:38,906 --> 00:04:40,206
Anything at all?

63
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,910
Yeah, bits and pieces.

64
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,207
I mean, angel inside of you...

65
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,287
It's kind of like being
chained to a comet.

66
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,567
Well, that doesn't
sound like much fun.

67
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,626
Understatement.

68
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:53,070
Cass said he wanted
to tell us something.

69
00:04:53,713 --> 00:04:55,336
Please tell me you remember that.

70
00:04:57,553 --> 00:04:58,553
Sorry.

71
00:05:00,515 --> 00:05:01,842
Come on. What do you know?

72
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,160
My name is Jimmy Novak.

73
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:11,843
I'm from Pontiac, Illinois.

74
00:05:13,662 --> 00:05:15,162
And I have a family.

75
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:20,678
Claire.

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,160
Bless this food, O lord,
And ourselves to thy loving service,

77
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,789
That we may always continue
in thy faith and fear

78
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:34,560
To the honor and glory of thy name.

79
00:05:34,929 --> 00:05:36,229
- Amen.
- Amen.

80
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,956
<i>I can see my head sticking out</i>

81
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,340
<i>From underneath the front bumper.
My eyes were closed.</i>

82
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:45,368
<i>My head was turned
to the right side.</i>

83
00:05:45,451 --> 00:05:49,120
<i>And on each side
of me is an angel, and...</i>

84
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:02,453
blank.

85
00:06:26,198 --> 00:06:27,598
So, what do we do?

86
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:29,850
The guy's got a family.

87
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:32,300
We buy him a bus ticket,
send him home.

88
00:06:32,995 --> 00:06:34,695
I don't know about that.

89
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,600
Dean, he's the only lead we got.

90
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:40,399
- He doesn't know anything.
- Are you 100% about that?

91
00:06:41,715 --> 00:06:43,265
You think he's lying?

92
00:06:43,706 --> 00:06:45,392
You want to go
guantanamo on the guy?

93
00:06:45,475 --> 00:06:48,375
Dean, maybe he doesn't
even know what he knows.

94
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,641
I say at least
we get him to Bobby's.

95
00:06:51,724 --> 00:06:55,007
Maybe all he needs is...
is hypnosis or a psychic,

96
00:06:55,538 --> 00:06:57,366
maybe Cass will just
drop back into him.

97
00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:59,206
- I don't know.
- Back there, that was

98
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:00,989
angel-on-angel violence.

99
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,047
I don't know what's going on,
but it's big,

100
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,134
and we can't just let the only
lead we've got just skip out.

101
00:07:07,896 --> 00:07:08,896
What?

102
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,897
Remember when our job
was helping people...

103
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,857
- Getting them back to their family?
- You think I don't want to help him?

104
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,027
I'm just being realistic.
We're doing him a favor.

105
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,784
- How?!
- Dean, if we want to question the guy,

106
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:22,467
You can damn well bet
the demons do, too.

107
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,007
What the hell are you talking about,
I can't go home?

108
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,016
You have a bull's-eye on your back.

109
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,654
What? From who?

110
00:07:33,847 --> 00:07:35,457
- Demons.
- Come on. That's crazy.

111
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,087
- What do they want with me?
- I don't know. Information, maybe.

112
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,647
I don't know anything!

113
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,044
- I know, but...
- Look, I'm done, okay?

114
00:07:42,406 --> 00:07:44,284
With demons, angels, all of it.

115
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:46,320
- I just want to go home.
- We understand.

116
00:07:46,403 --> 00:07:48,051
I don't think
that you do understand.

117
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,784
I've been shot, stabbed and healed,

118
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:51,710
my body's been dragged
all over the earth.

119
00:07:51,793 --> 00:07:54,343
By some miracle,
I'm out, and I am done.

120
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,778
I've given enough, okay?

121
00:07:56,861 --> 00:07:59,353
All we're saying is
that until we figure this out,

122
00:07:59,436 --> 00:08:01,336
The safest place is with us.

123
00:08:02,405 --> 00:08:03,405
How long?

124
00:08:06,662 --> 00:08:08,862
We'll cross that bridge
when we get to it.

125
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,717
- Where you going?
- To see my wife and daughter, okay?

126
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,943
No, you're not.

127
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,857
You're just gonna put
those people in danger.

128
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,990
So, what... now I'm a prisoner?

129
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:18,831
Harsh way to put it.

130
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,416
Dean!

131
00:09:58,469 --> 00:09:59,919
Would you hurry up?

132
00:10:03,323 --> 00:10:05,323
Sorry... this is funny to you?

133
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,466
Mr. Big bad prison guard,
and Jimmy Mcmook gives you the slip?

134
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:12,449
It's pretty funny.
What were you doing, anyway?

135
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:13,987
I was getting a coke.

136
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,800
Was it a refreshing coke?

137
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:19,896
Can we just go, please?

138
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,544
- What the hell are you doing?
- It's okay.

139
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,071
- I'm okay.
- Jimmy.

140
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:13,046
Look.

141
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,007
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing's wrong.

142
00:11:16,188 --> 00:11:17,738
He asked me to do it.

143
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,270
Who asked you to do it?

144
00:11:21,609 --> 00:11:22,609
Castiel.

145
00:11:23,386 --> 00:11:25,086
To prove my faith. Look.

146
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,830
I'm fine.

147
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:28,687
It's a miracle.

148
00:11:29,275 --> 00:11:30,522
Who's Castiel?

149
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,035
Hey, guys.

150
00:11:44,497 --> 00:11:45,454
Geez!

151
00:11:47,593 --> 00:11:50,093
- Smooth.
- You ever try calling ahead?

152
00:11:50,272 --> 00:11:52,322
I like the element of surprise.

153
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:54,925
You look terrific.

154
00:11:56,988 --> 00:11:59,288
Not the most appropriate time, Dean.

155
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,941
You let Jimmy get away?

156
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:04,222
Talk to ginormo here.

157
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:08,013
Sam...

158
00:12:09,634 --> 00:12:11,021
You seem... different.

159
00:12:12,814 --> 00:12:13,814
Me?

160
00:12:15,237 --> 00:12:16,610
I don't know. Haircut?

161
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:19,632
That's not what I'm talking about.

162
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:27,304
So, what'd Jimmy tell you?

163
00:12:27,849 --> 00:12:30,094
- He remember anything?
- Why? What's going on?

164
00:12:30,177 --> 00:12:32,327
It's Cass. He got sent back home.

165
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:35,647
- Well, more like dragged back.
- To heaven?

166
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:38,231
- That's not a good thing?
- No.

167
00:12:38,531 --> 00:12:40,231
That's a very bad thing.

168
00:12:40,835 --> 00:12:42,846
Painfully, awfully bad.

169
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:46,932
He must have seriously
pissed someone off.

170
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,660
Cass said he had something
to tell me, something important.

171
00:12:49,743 --> 00:12:51,327
- What?
- I don't know.

172
00:12:51,586 --> 00:12:53,897
- Does Jimmy know?
- I don't think so.

173
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,571
You don't think so?

174
00:12:55,654 --> 00:12:57,454
Whatever it is, it's huge.

175
00:12:57,857 --> 00:13:00,867
- You got to find out for sure.
- That's why we're going after Jimmy.

176
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,740
That's why you shouldn't have
let him go in the first place.

177
00:13:04,547 --> 00:13:06,547
He's... probably dead already.

178
00:13:47,064 --> 00:13:48,076
Take the pills.

179
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,787
- I'm not sick.
- Jimmy, take the pills.

180
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,470
I know that this is
hard to understand...

181
00:13:55,162 --> 00:13:56,462
But he chose me.

182
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,963
- Castiel the angel?
- He's spoken to me now, Ames

183
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,180
A dozen times.

184
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:04,759
You believe in god, don't you?

185
00:14:04,842 --> 00:14:06,845
What kind of question is that?
Of course.

186
00:14:07,938 --> 00:14:09,890
- And angels?
- Yes, Jimmy.

187
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,939
So, why is it, then,
so hard for you to believe

188
00:14:12,022 --> 00:14:13,810
- That they're talking to me?
- You sell

189
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,979
- ad time for a. m Radio.
- No, he said that

190
00:14:16,152 --> 00:14:18,152
I'm special, it's in my blood.

191
00:14:19,046 --> 00:14:20,439
It's in your blood?

192
00:14:20,522 --> 00:14:23,089
He didn't say.
He just said that god has chosen me

193
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:25,363
- for a higher purpose.
- To do what?

194
00:14:26,028 --> 00:14:27,828
You know, it's god's will.

195
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:30,813
Not really my place to question it.

196
00:14:31,718 --> 00:14:33,345
Hey, come here.

197
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,705
This is a blessing.

198
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,176
This is the most important thing
to ever happen to me.

199
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:49,892
I thought we were the most
important things to ever happen to you.

200
00:14:49,975 --> 00:14:52,307
- Have faith.
- Jimmy... you're scaring me.

201
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,825
God will provide.

202
00:14:53,908 --> 00:14:57,308
If you won't take your pills
and if you won't get help...

203
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,776
... then I'm gonna take Claire
to my mother's in the morning.

204
00:15:18,488 --> 00:15:20,085
So, I want to help you.

205
00:15:20,908 --> 00:15:24,047
I'm about to lose my family here
If you don't tell me how.

206
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,347
Please, Castiel, just talk to me.

207
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,509
What do you want from me?

208
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,843
Yes, I understand.

209
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,529
Promise my family will be okay
and I'll do it.

210
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,170
Then...

211
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,950
Daddy?

212
00:16:36,072 --> 00:16:37,622
I am not your father.

213
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,710
We...

214
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:20,949
- We stopped looking for you.
- I'm so sorry.

215
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:24,491
You were dead.

216
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,177
We... we thought you were dead.

217
00:17:28,874 --> 00:17:29,874
I'm okay.

218
00:17:38,845 --> 00:17:40,308
Claire, room, now.

219
00:17:45,186 --> 00:17:46,386
Can I see her?

220
00:17:48,223 --> 00:17:49,223
No.

221
00:17:50,334 --> 00:17:51,684
I don't know yet.

222
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,580
- It's been almost a year, you know?
- I know.

223
00:17:59,393 --> 00:18:02,943
Think your daughter would have
wanted to know you were okay.

224
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,460
I was in a psych clinic.

225
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:13,049
I just wanted to get myself
straight before seeing you.

226
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:18,538
- And no telephones, or...
- No. I know. You're right. I'm...

227
00:18:21,295 --> 00:18:22,445
I'm so sorry.

228
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:26,836
But it's all, it's all over now.

229
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:31,274
- I mean, I'm really okay.
- What does that mean?

230
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:37,343
I was, I was confused, Amelia.

231
00:18:38,812 --> 00:18:40,712
I was completely delusional.

232
00:18:43,574 --> 00:18:46,447
And I thought, I thought god was
calling me to something,

233
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,447
And I thought that it was important.

234
00:18:48,873 --> 00:18:49,873
And...

235
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,740
I was wrong.
I was such an idiot.

236
00:18:57,649 --> 00:18:58,899
Heaven, hell...

237
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,460
None of that matters.

238
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,687
The only thing that's important
to me is you and Claire.

239
00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:19,122
And I...

240
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,021
I can't undo what I've done.

241
00:19:27,552 --> 00:19:29,417
But I just want to come home again.

242
00:19:33,449 --> 00:19:35,449
I don't know if I can do that.

243
00:19:37,255 --> 00:19:38,255
Not yet.

244
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,515
I mean, whatever...
you're comfortable with.

245
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:52,817
Maybe we could start
with something smaller?

246
00:19:53,338 --> 00:19:54,338
Like what?

247
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:57,149
I don't know. Dinner?

248
00:19:57,277 --> 00:19:59,227
Where the hell are you, Ruby?

249
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,940
This isn't funny anymore.

250
00:20:03,614 --> 00:20:04,640
I'm all out.

251
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,516
Stop whatever you're doing.

252
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:09,020
Call me.

253
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:12,401
I need more.

254
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:19,772
- Hi, daddy.
- Hi, baby.

255
00:20:28,597 --> 00:20:31,229
We have turkey and roast beef.

256
00:20:31,847 --> 00:20:34,738
- Better be okay. It's all we have.
- It's fine.

257
00:20:35,424 --> 00:20:36,924
It's more than fine.

258
00:20:42,169 --> 00:20:43,869
- Shall we sit?
- Yeah.

259
00:20:53,014 --> 00:20:54,210
It's perfect.

260
00:20:55,908 --> 00:20:58,298
Daddy aren't you gonna say grace?

261
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,723
No, honey, I don't think I am.

262
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,474
Why are you crying?

263
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,460
'cause I'm happy.

264
00:21:27,741 --> 00:21:29,097
Am I crazy, or did I just see

265
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,782
your husband wander in here
about half an hour ago?

266
00:21:32,122 --> 00:21:33,807
Yeah, you did. But...

267
00:21:34,598 --> 00:21:37,330
- Roger, now's not a good time.
- Hey. There he is.

268
00:21:37,413 --> 00:21:39,464
Son of a bitch.
What the hell happened to you?

269
00:21:41,003 --> 00:21:42,506
Long story. But it's over.

270
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,920
Yeah?

271
00:21:44,508 --> 00:21:46,658
- I'm good.
- Can I talk to you?

272
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,305
Can I get you a beer?

273
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:51,137
- That'd be good.
- Thanks.

274
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:53,370
Get in here.

275
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:57,341
Buddy, you scared the hell out
of a lot of people.

276
00:21:57,424 --> 00:21:58,760
I know, I know.

277
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,319
So, really, what happened?

278
00:22:03,828 --> 00:22:04,828
Honestly?

279
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,717
Worst year of my life
and you wouldn't believe a word of it.

280
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,624
But... it's all okay now.

281
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:11,329
Swear.

282
00:22:12,408 --> 00:22:13,950
Actually, no, it's not.

283
00:22:15,132 --> 00:22:16,125
What do you mean?

284
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,586
I'm gonna gut your daughter
while you watch.

285
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:22,649
Here you go.

286
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,738
What are you doing!

287
00:22:25,821 --> 00:22:27,250
- He's a demon!
- Jimmy, stop!

288
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:28,638
- Run! Run!
- Stop it!

289
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,477
- Where is it?
- Roger was your best friend.

290
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:35,812
Roger was a demon.

291
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,147
- Don't cross this line.
- You thought you were better.

292
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,842
But you are so sick.
- I'm not crazy.

293
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,402
- Stay the hell away from us!
- This is very, very real.

294
00:22:42,721 --> 00:22:44,529
Claire! No! Run!

295
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,063
Leave her alone!

296
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,337
Stay there! Claire!

297
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,369
Damn it!

298
00:22:53,147 --> 00:22:54,038
Hey, pal.

299
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,624
- Told you I'd gut the bitch.
- Roger.

300
00:22:56,972 --> 00:22:58,666
- Daddy?
- Just let her go, okay?

301
00:22:58,749 --> 00:22:59,997
Now, me... I would.

302
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,550
But the missus...
she has other ideas.

303
00:23:04,093 --> 00:23:05,093
Daddy!

304
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:09,053
Oh, my god.

305
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,930
No!

306
00:23:19,706 --> 00:23:21,274
Go! Get them out of here!

307
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:22,617
Go! Go!

308
00:23:29,684 --> 00:23:32,229
Can't get it up, can you, Sam?

309
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,362
No, but I can.

310
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:43,537
Come on, come on, come on.

311
00:23:44,646 --> 00:23:45,506
Oh, my god.

312
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,247
- Where's your wife?
- Right here.

313
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:48,593
Let's go!

314
00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:00,663
You were right.

315
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:04,010
Sorry we were.

316
00:24:04,093 --> 00:24:06,611
But I'm telling you...
I don't know anything.

317
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,322
I don't think they're
inclined to believe you.

318
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,048
And even if they did,
you're a vessel.

319
00:24:12,716 --> 00:24:14,827
They're still gonna want to
know what makes you tick.

320
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,288
Which means vivisection...
if they're feeling generous.

321
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,335
I'm gonna tell you once again...

322
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:21,532
You're putting
your family in danger.

323
00:24:21,615 --> 00:24:23,002
You have to come with us.

324
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:30,361
How long?

325
00:24:31,247 --> 00:24:33,687
And don't give me that "cross
that bridge when we get to it" crap.

326
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,120
Don't you get it?

327
00:24:35,706 --> 00:24:36,706
Forever.

328
00:24:37,296 --> 00:24:38,601
The demons will never stop.

329
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,937
You can never be with your family.

330
00:24:41,969 --> 00:24:44,005
So, you either get as far
away from them as possible

331
00:24:44,088 --> 00:24:45,841
Or you put a bullet in your head,

332
00:24:45,924 --> 00:24:47,809
And that's how you
keep your family safe,

333
00:24:47,892 --> 00:24:50,752
But there's no getting out
and there's no going home.

334
00:24:50,835 --> 00:24:52,207
Don't sugarcoat it, Sam.

335
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,325
I'm just telling
him the truth, Dean.

336
00:24:54,408 --> 00:24:55,368
Someone has to.

337
00:25:09,249 --> 00:25:11,457
I pretty much owe you
the biggest apology ever.

338
00:25:12,408 --> 00:25:14,819
- No, you don't.
- Yes. I do.

339
00:25:16,941 --> 00:25:18,391
I'm so sorry, Jimmy.

340
00:25:19,677 --> 00:25:21,018
And I will never,

341
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,486
ever forgive myself
for letting you walk out that door.

342
00:25:25,747 --> 00:25:28,860
Well, you did what any rational
person would have done.

343
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:31,714
I mean, hell,
I thought I was crazy half the time.

344
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:36,742
So... demons, huh?

345
00:25:37,271 --> 00:25:38,271
Yeah.

346
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:42,919
Can we...

347
00:25:44,354 --> 00:25:46,002
Can we even go home, or...?

348
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,320
What are we gonna do?

349
00:25:52,021 --> 00:25:55,221
These boys are gonna get you a car.
Don't ask me how.

350
00:25:56,369 --> 00:25:58,405
And you're gonna take
Claire to Carl and Sally's

351
00:25:58,488 --> 00:25:59,938
As fast as you can.

352
00:26:00,503 --> 00:26:02,053
Wait. What about you?

353
00:26:05,194 --> 00:26:07,422
No. I'm not going
anywhere without you, Jimmy.

354
00:26:07,505 --> 00:26:08,655
Listen to me.

355
00:26:09,828 --> 00:26:12,195
Every moment that I'm with you.
You and Claire are in danger.

356
00:26:12,765 --> 00:26:14,995
I don't care.
We are not splitting up again.

357
00:26:15,078 --> 00:26:16,728
We don't have a choice.

358
00:26:20,407 --> 00:26:21,370
For how long?

359
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:27,043
We'll... cross
that bridge when we get to it.

360
00:26:39,992 --> 00:26:42,792
- We're family.
- They will kill you, Amelia.

361
00:26:44,356 --> 00:26:46,087
And they'll kill Claire.

362
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,731
You just have to get as far
away from me as you can.

363
00:27:02,728 --> 00:27:05,482
Okay, so... here's your car.

364
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,986
Take care of your mom, okay, bub?

365
00:27:37,672 --> 00:27:39,460
Why is he leaving again?

366
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:49,219
This is just not my day, is it?

367
00:27:49,505 --> 00:27:50,855
You little bitch.

368
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:01,745
What the hell happened back there?

369
00:28:02,983 --> 00:28:03,983
What?

370
00:28:04,986 --> 00:28:07,886
You practically fainted
trying to gank a demon.

371
00:28:08,844 --> 00:28:10,394
Okay, I didn't faint.

372
00:28:11,703 --> 00:28:13,949
- I got a little dizzy.
- You can call it whatever you want.

373
00:28:14,032 --> 00:28:16,869
Point is, you used to be
strong enough to kill alastair.

374
00:28:16,952 --> 00:28:19,313
Now you can't even kill
stunt demon number three?

375
00:28:19,396 --> 00:28:20,982
What do you want me to say about it?

376
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:22,893
For starters,
what's going on with your mojo?

377
00:28:22,976 --> 00:28:25,161
It's yo-yo'ing all over the place.

378
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:28,510
I'm not trying to pick a fight here.
you're scaring me, man.

379
00:28:30,689 --> 00:28:31,959
I'm scaring myself.

380
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,370
Hello?

381
00:28:40,448 --> 00:28:41,548
Who is this?

382
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:49,043
It's your wife.

383
00:28:52,629 --> 00:28:53,629
Amelia?

384
00:28:58,547 --> 00:28:59,597
Oh, my god.

385
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:11,076
They're expecting you to come alone.
That's exactly what you're gonna do.

386
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:13,427
We'll work our way
through the catwalks.

387
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,057
We'll be right behind you.

388
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,256
All you got to do is stay calm
and stall and let us do our job.

389
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,837
You want me to stay calm?
This is my family we're talking about.

390
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,267
Listen to me, this will work.

391
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,105
You understand?
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

392
00:29:24,188 --> 00:29:25,188
Whatever.

393
00:29:26,147 --> 00:29:27,797
Give me a minute, okay?

394
00:29:31,058 --> 00:29:33,479
There's no way they're expecting
him to come alone, Dean.

395
00:29:34,296 --> 00:29:36,247
You know this is probably a trap.

396
00:29:36,656 --> 00:29:38,943
Yeah, I know.
That's why I have a plan.

397
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,486
Castiel, you son of a bitch!

398
00:29:46,569 --> 00:29:48,953
You promised me
my family would be okay!

399
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,092
You promised you were
gonna take care of them!

400
00:29:51,175 --> 00:29:53,662
I've gave you everything
you asked me to give!

401
00:29:53,745 --> 00:29:55,866
I gave you more!
This is the thanks I get?

402
00:29:55,949 --> 00:29:57,449
This is what you do?

403
00:29:58,088 --> 00:30:00,567
Your heaven?!
Help me, please!

404
00:30:00,784 --> 00:30:02,686
You promised, Cass!

405
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,110
Just help me!

406
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,490
Typical.

407
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:34,915
Hi, honey. You're home.

408
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,825
Listen, I'm...

409
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:39,845
I'm begging you here.

410
00:30:40,347 --> 00:30:42,647
You do whatever you want with me...

411
00:30:43,783 --> 00:30:45,702
But my wife and daughter,
they're just...

412
00:30:45,785 --> 00:30:49,287
- They're not a part of this.
- They're a big part of this, Jimmy.

413
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:51,725
And p.s, you should have come alone.

414
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:56,010
- I am alone.
- Oh, you're such a liar.

415
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,606
Like I didn't think you'd
bring Heckle and Jeckle.

416
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:06,030
- Nice plan, Dean.
- Well, nobody bats a thousand.

417
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,398
Got the knife?

418
00:31:08,866 --> 00:31:11,147
- And you know what's funny?
- You wearing a soccer mom?

419
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,980
Is I was actually bummed
to get this detail.

420
00:31:14,063 --> 00:31:15,789
Picking up an empty vessel?

421
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,817
Sort of like a milk run.

422
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,503
- Now look who landed in my lap.
- Yeah, well...

423
00:31:20,937 --> 00:31:22,631
You got us, okay?

424
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,140
- Let these people go.
- Oh, Sam.

425
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:28,269
It's easy to act chivalrous

426
00:31:28,352 --> 00:31:30,804
When your wonder girl
powers aren't working, huh?

427
00:31:33,739 --> 00:31:35,489
Now for the punch line...

428
00:31:35,901 --> 00:31:37,151
Everybody dies.

429
00:31:47,964 --> 00:31:49,764
Waste little orphan annie.

430
00:32:24,994 --> 00:32:25,943
Castiel.

431
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,807
Of course we keep our promises.

432
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,430
Of course you have our gratitude.

433
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,233
You served us well.

434
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:58,066
Your work is done.

435
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:01,918
It's time to go home now...
your real home.

436
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,293
You'll rest forever in
the fields of the lord.

437
00:34:07,401 --> 00:34:08,701
Rest now, Jimmy.

438
00:34:11,557 --> 00:34:12,840
She's with me now.

439
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:15,637
She's chosen.

440
00:34:16,072 --> 00:34:17,846
It's in her blood,
as it was in yours.

441
00:34:18,325 --> 00:34:19,625
Please, Castiel.

442
00:34:20,799 --> 00:34:22,749
I mean, just... just take me.

443
00:34:23,111 --> 00:34:24,645
Take me, please.

444
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:31,028
I want to make sure you understand.

445
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,306
You won't die... or age.

446
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,671
If this last year
was painful for you,

447
00:34:35,754 --> 00:34:38,784
Picture a hundred...
a thousand more like it.

448
00:34:41,268 --> 00:34:42,518
Doesn't matter.

449
00:34:42,812 --> 00:34:43,872
You take me.

450
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:45,765
Just take me.

451
00:34:52,202 --> 00:34:53,215
As you wish.

452
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,433
Cass, hold up.

453
00:35:40,272 --> 00:35:41,722
What were you gonna tell me?

454
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:45,141
I learned my lesson
while I was away, Dean.

455
00:35:46,002 --> 00:35:48,455
I serve heaven. I don't serve man.

456
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:51,534
And I certainly don't serve you.

457
00:36:16,337 --> 00:36:18,087
All right. Let's hear it.

458
00:36:19,447 --> 00:36:21,350
- What?
- Drop the bomb, man.

459
00:36:21,433 --> 00:36:23,897
You saw what I did. Come on.
Stop the car. Take a swing.

460
00:36:24,267 --> 00:36:27,667
- I'm not gonna take a swing.
- Then scream. Chew me out.

461
00:36:28,412 --> 00:36:30,604
- I'm not mad, Sam.
- Come on. You're not mad?

462
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,234
Right. Look,
at least let me explain myself.

463
00:36:35,825 --> 00:36:36,825
Don't.

464
00:36:37,761 --> 00:36:38,911
I don't care.

465
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:42,367
You don't care?

466
00:36:43,646 --> 00:36:46,036
What do you want me to say
that I'm disappointed?

467
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,420
Yeah, I am.

468
00:36:49,033 --> 00:36:51,133
But mostly, I'm just tired, man.

469
00:36:53,818 --> 00:36:54,968
And I'm done.

470
00:36:56,188 --> 00:36:57,438
I am just done.

471
00:37:02,272 --> 00:37:03,136
Hey, Bobby.

472
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,514
You and your brother better
shag ass to my place asap.

473
00:37:06,156 --> 00:37:07,800
<i>- What's going on?
- The apocalypse,</i>

474
00:37:07,883 --> 00:37:10,143
genius. Now, get your
asses over here.

475
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:14,557
What'd he say?

476
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:17,747
Well, thanks for shaking a tail.

477
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,230
Glad you got here.

478
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,557
Go on inside.
I want to show you something.

479
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,727
All right.

480
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,060
So... what's the big demon problem?

481
00:37:31,601 --> 00:37:32,601
You are.

482
00:37:33,161 --> 00:37:34,961
This is for your own good.

483
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:38,870
Guys?

484
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,260
Hey. Guys!

485
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,940
<i>This isn't funny!</i>

486
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:45,762
<i>Guys!</i>

487
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,470
<i>Guys!</i>

488
00:37:55,593 --> 00:37:58,655
I'm not drinking
the demon blood for kicks.

489
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,600
I'm getting strong
enough to kill Lilith.

490
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,780
All the seals falling.

491
00:38:04,331 --> 00:38:05,177
Except one.

492
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,535
You give yourself over holy to
the serves of the god and his angels.

493
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:12,357
- Yes. I swear.
- I will wait on... time.

494
00:38:14,861 --> 00:38:16,956
I'm not gonna give him demon blood.
I won't do it.

495
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:19,171
I won't let my brother
turnning into a monster.

496
00:38:21,942 --> 00:38:22,966
Guys, help

497
00:38:23,737 --> 00:38:25,928
- Sam looks last... st worker.
- We are killing him.

498
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,484
This poison I hope is Ruby.

499
00:38:30,567 --> 00:38:32,142
***

500
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,260
She is poison, Sam.

501
00:38:36,986 --> 00:38:40,317
You are gonna out door,
don't you ever come back

502
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,100
I've been waiting this

503
00:38:46,915 --> 00:38:49,850
- For a very long time.
- Then give me your best shoot.
