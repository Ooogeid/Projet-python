1
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:20,603
- Who are you?
- Castiel. I'm an angel of the lord.

2
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,064
I've got demon blood in me, Dean!

3
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:27,223
- I'm a whole new level of freak!
- Lilith is trying to break the 66 seals

4
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,946
To free lucifer from hell.

5
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,791
And why would an angel
rescue me from hell?

6
00:00:30,874 --> 00:00:32,824
Because we have work for you.

7
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,981
She's no nurse.
She's Lilith's personal chef.

8
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:42,128
Sucking blood?
You got to know that's wrong.

9
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:44,001
I wish to god i could stop.

10
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:50,201
You give yourself over wholly

11
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,303
to the service of god
and his angels?

12
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,536
Yes. I swear.

13
00:00:54,313 --> 00:00:56,207
You're an angel, aren't you?
I'm zachariah.

14
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,227
This man is a prophet of the lord.

15
00:01:09,452 --> 00:01:12,405
I'm not drinking
the demon blood for kicks.

16
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,199
She's poison, Sam!
Look what she did to you!

17
00:01:16,964 --> 00:01:19,703
You walk out that door,
don't you ever come back.

18
00:01:56,869 --> 00:01:58,569
Our father who art in...

19
00:01:59,272 --> 00:02:00,077
Heaven...

20
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:02,049
Hallowed be thy name.

21
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:04,331
Thy kingdom come, blah, blah, blah.

22
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:06,618
Lead us not into temptation,

23
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:10,014
but deliver us... from evil.

24
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,261
Truer words never spoken,
huh, sisters?

25
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,856
But sometimes it seems as
if it's difficult to know the creator.

26
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:26,506
Sometimes i feel
in a very literal sense...

27
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,190
That i have been
wandering the desert for years.

28
00:02:31,032 --> 00:02:32,610
Looking for our father.

29
00:02:35,903 --> 00:02:37,156
Well, not our father.

30
00:02:37,798 --> 00:02:39,739
My father, see, he's in jail.

31
00:02:40,908 --> 00:02:42,558
Your dad put him there.

32
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,514
I almost gave up hope.

33
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:48,120
But "ye of little faith"...

34
00:02:48,203 --> 00:02:49,956
Because i finally found him

35
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,504
or at least, the spot
where his cage door opens.

36
00:02:53,357 --> 00:02:54,657
It's right here.

37
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:58,202
In a damn convent, for god's sake.

38
00:03:00,122 --> 00:03:02,625
- Life is funny.
- Father?

39
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:05,643
Shut your friggin'pie hole,
you little slut!

40
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:14,735
Then again,
i suppose it makes sense.

41
00:03:15,814 --> 00:03:16,999
Folks forget my...

42
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,533
daddy is an angel, after all.

43
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:21,735
Or was.

44
00:03:22,587 --> 00:03:25,191
I mean, i suppose
some dumb bastard stood here,

45
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:28,694
felt a jolt of his holy juice,
and thought,

46
00:03:28,912 --> 00:03:31,043
"i'm gonna build me a nun factory."

47
00:03:33,705 --> 00:03:34,705
Well...

48
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,115
It's the right idea...

49
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:39,211
Wrong angel.

50
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:48,970
So...

51
00:03:50,123 --> 00:03:52,673
If any of you gals
are the praying type.

52
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:55,234
Now would be a good time to start.

53
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:35,499
Sam?

54
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:39,361
Your head in the game, here?

55
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:43,667
I'm good. Let's go.

56
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:48,229
You okay?

57
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,945
I just said i was.

58
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:57,637
Look, i know hand-holding
really isn't my thing.

59
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:00,518
But still, Dean was wrong
saying what he said to you.

60
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:01,967
No, he was right to say it.

61
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:04,465
I don't blame him, after what i did.

62
00:05:04,548 --> 00:05:06,624
After we're done,
you guys will patch things up.

63
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:09,360
- You always do.
- You're talking like i got an "after."

64
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:10,434
Don't say that.

65
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:15,480
I can feel it inside me, Ruby.

66
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:17,149
I've changed.

67
00:05:17,968 --> 00:05:18,968
For good.

68
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,522
There's no going back now.

69
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,576
I know what i got to do.
It's okay.

70
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,044
I'm just saying.

71
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,582
Dean's better off
as far away from me as possible.

72
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,418
Anyway, doesn't matter.
Let's just get this done with.

73
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:51,859
Dean?

74
00:05:54,197 --> 00:05:55,197
Dean.

75
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,608
- You listen to a word i said?
- Yeah, i heard you.

76
00:06:01,187 --> 00:06:02,687
I'm not calling him.

77
00:06:03,388 --> 00:06:05,030
Don't make me get my gun, boy.

78
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,496
We are damn near kickoff
for armageddon.

79
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:09,675
Don't you think we got
bigger fish at the moment?

80
00:06:09,758 --> 00:06:12,820
I know you're pissed and i'm not
making apologies for what he's done,

81
00:06:12,903 --> 00:06:14,425
- But he's your...
- Blood?

82
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,469
He's my blood
is that what you're gonna say?

83
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:19,086
He's your brother,
and he's drowning.

84
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,897
Bobby, i tried to help him.
I did.

85
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,758
- Look what happened.
- So try again.

86
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:29,789
It's too late.

87
00:06:30,992 --> 00:06:33,492
- There's no such thing.
- No! Damn it!

88
00:06:37,115 --> 00:06:38,438
We got to face the facts...

89
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:41,274
Sam never wanted
part of this family.

90
00:06:41,877 --> 00:06:43,654
He hated this life growing up.

91
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,737
Ran away to stanford
first chance he got.

92
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,048
And now it's like déjà vu
all over again.

93
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:51,619
Well, i am sick

94
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:54,287
and tired of chasing him.

95
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,915
Screw him.
He can do what he wants.

96
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,533
- You don't mean that.
- Yes, i do, Bobby.

97
00:07:00,571 --> 00:07:01,621
Sam's gone.

98
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:03,046
He's gone.

99
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,924
I'm not even sure if he's still
my brother anymore.

100
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:11,989
If he ever was.

101
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:24,345
You stupid, stupid son of a bitch!

102
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,137
Well, boohoo!

103
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,364
I am so sorry your feelings
are hurt, princess!

104
00:07:29,697 --> 00:07:32,993
Are you under the impression that
family's supposed to make you feel good,

105
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:34,745
bake you an apple pie, maybe?

106
00:07:35,198 --> 00:07:37,080
They're supposed to
make you miserable!

107
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,040
- That's why they're family!
- I told him, "you walk out that door,

108
00:07:40,123 --> 00:07:42,252
don't come back,"
and he walked out anyway.

109
00:07:42,687 --> 00:07:45,422
- That was his choice!
- You sound like a whiny brat.

110
00:07:50,196 --> 00:07:51,761
You sound like your dad.

111
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:55,710
Well, let me tell you something...
Your dad was a coward.

112
00:07:59,888 --> 00:08:01,855
My dad was a lot of things,
Bobby, but a coward?

113
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:04,941
He'd rather push Sam away
than reach out to him.

114
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:07,752
Well, that don't strike me as brave.

115
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:11,047
You...

116
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,284
are a better man
than your daddy ever was.

117
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:17,787
So you do both of us a favor...

118
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,050
don't be him.

119
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:49,411
Hello, Dean.

120
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:53,949
It's almost time.

121
00:09:00,015 --> 00:09:02,652
We're gonna take you
to the nursery, sugar.

122
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:05,102
Let mommy and daddy get some sleep.

123
00:09:05,573 --> 00:09:07,223
He's a beautiful child.

124
00:09:08,113 --> 00:09:09,965
Absolutely scrumptious.

125
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,624
Patty-cake, patty-cake, baker's man

126
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,517
bake me a cake as fast as you can

127
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,116
pat it and roll it

128
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,201
and mark it with a "b"

129
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,190
and put it in the oven...

130
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:39,879
So, we need to talk.

131
00:10:16,442 --> 00:10:18,658
Hello, Dean.
You're looking fit.

132
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:25,540
Well, how'bout this?
"The suite life of zack and cass."

133
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:29,795
It's a...

134
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,673
Never mind. So, what is this?
Where the hell am i?

135
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,341
Call it a greenroom.

136
00:10:35,562 --> 00:10:37,552
We're closing in
on the grand finale, here.

137
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:40,705
We want to keep you safe
before showtime.

138
00:10:41,176 --> 00:10:43,224
Try a burger.
They're your favorite.

139
00:10:43,535 --> 00:10:46,519
From that seaside shack in delaware.
You were 11, i think.

140
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:48,781
- I'm not hungry.
- No?

141
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:52,150
How about ginger from season 2
of "gilligan's island"?

142
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,818
You do have a thing for her,
don't you?

143
00:10:56,398 --> 00:10:57,398
Tempting.

144
00:10:58,018 --> 00:10:59,944
- Weird.
- We'll throw in mary ann for free.

145
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:01,327
No, no. Let's...

146
00:11:02,105 --> 00:11:04,621
bail on the holodeck, okay?
I want to know what the game plan is.

147
00:11:05,382 --> 00:11:07,082
Let us worry about that.

148
00:11:07,268 --> 00:11:10,043
We want you...
focused, relaxed.

149
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,797
I'm about to be pissed
and leaving, so start talking, chuckles.

150
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:20,829
All the seals have fallen.

151
00:11:21,232 --> 00:11:22,282
Except one.

152
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,927
That's an impressive score.
That's...

153
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,039
That's right up there
with the washington generals.

154
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:29,907
You think sarcasm's
appropriate, do you?

155
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,190
Considering...

156
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:33,525
You started all this?

157
00:11:36,581 --> 00:11:38,131
But the final seal...

158
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,144
... it'll be different.

159
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:43,227
Why?

160
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,663
Lilith has to break it.

161
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,681
She's the only one who can.

162
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:51,292
- Tomorrow night, midnight.
- Where?

163
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,148
- We're working on it.
- Work harder.

164
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:55,192
We'll do our job.
You just make sure you do yours.

165
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:56,663
And what is that, exactly?

166
00:11:56,746 --> 00:11:59,225
If i'm supposed to be the one
that stops her, how? With the knife?

167
00:11:59,308 --> 00:12:01,372
- All in good time.
- Isn't now a good time?

168
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:03,341
- Have faith.
- What, in you?

169
00:12:03,424 --> 00:12:05,594
Give me one good reason
why i should.

170
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,444
Because you swore your obedience.

171
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,666
So obey.

172
00:12:34,346 --> 00:12:37,088
- What, no devil's trap?
- I don't need one.

173
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,674
Look at you, all'roided up.

174
00:12:39,934 --> 00:12:42,010
It's like a-rod and madonna
over here.

175
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:44,595
- Where's Lilith?
- I'm not scared of you.

176
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,720
Yeah, you are, actually.

177
00:12:47,574 --> 00:12:49,088
And with good reason.

178
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:53,340
What's my upside?

179
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:56,524
Okay, i tell you, you kill me.
I don't tell you, you still kill me.

180
00:12:56,845 --> 00:12:59,356
I get away somehow,
Lilith will definitely kill me.

181
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:00,901
So where's my carrot?

182
00:13:00,984 --> 00:13:04,911
I think what you should be worrying
about is what happens before you die.

183
00:13:26,614 --> 00:13:27,472
Screw it.

184
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:35,822
It's Sam.
Leave me a message.

185
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,217
Hey, it's me.

186
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,922
Look, i'll just get right to it.

187
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,409
I'm still pissed...

188
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:50,203
And i owe you a serious beatdown.

189
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:52,508
But...

190
00:13:56,762 --> 00:13:59,012
I shouldn't have said what i said.

191
00:14:00,484 --> 00:14:02,084
You know, i'm not dad.

192
00:14:04,228 --> 00:14:06,728
We're brothers.
You know, we're family.

193
00:14:07,224 --> 00:14:08,224
And...

194
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:12,149
No matter how bad it gets,
that doesn't change.

195
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:15,938
Sammy, i'm sorry...

196
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:34,924
Stop! Stop! Please!

197
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,917
- You'll tell me where she is?
- Fine. Fine. Just...

198
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:39,878
- let me die.
- Deal.

199
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,484
Tomorrow night. Midnight.

200
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,506
She's gonna be at a convent.

201
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,889
St. Mary's, Ilchester, Maryland.

202
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:53,934
- A convent?
- Lilith...

203
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:56,852
She's gonna break the final seal.

204
00:14:57,214 --> 00:15:00,014
- And what is the final seal?
- I don't know.

205
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:02,316
I don't know!
I don't know!

206
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,986
I don't know! I swear!

207
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,039
Ohh, please!

208
00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:10,241
I'm begging you, kill me, please!

209
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,742
Fine.

210
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:13,812
Wait. You can't.

211
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,455
- Why not?
- Because we got to take her with us.

212
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:19,500
It's the final run on the death star,
and you need more juice than i got.

213
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,818
You promised.

214
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:23,879
Sorry, sister. You're a walking,
talking can of whup-ass.

215
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:25,610
- You bitch!
- I know.

216
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:27,989
Just can't trust anyone these days.

217
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,873
Least you won't be able
to crack me open that easy.

218
00:15:39,956 --> 00:15:40,813
That so?

219
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,050
Don't forget, it's not just me
you're bleeding.

220
00:15:44,803 --> 00:15:46,610
In fact, i think
i'm gonna take a little,

221
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:48,728
Siesta in the subconscious...

222
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:51,201
Hand over the wheel
for a little bit.

223
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,328
- What are you talking about?
- Cindy Mccellen, R.N.,

224
00:15:56,357 --> 00:15:57,507
Come on down!

225
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:10,902
What...

226
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,690
Where am i?

227
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,636
Oh, my god, i can't move.

228
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:22,909
What's going on?

229
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:24,857
Help!

230
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:26,786
Help me, please.

231
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,612
Great.

232
00:16:41,782 --> 00:16:43,032
Father, look...

233
00:16:43,884 --> 00:16:47,880
I'm not exactly the praying type,
but still, i made the sacrifice.

234
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,190
I got you a bagful of nuns.

235
00:16:51,692 --> 00:16:52,692
So...

236
00:16:54,677 --> 00:16:55,977
Can you hear me?

237
00:16:56,905 --> 00:16:59,055
Can you whisper through the door?

238
00:17:17,316 --> 00:17:18,666
I'm here, my son.

239
00:17:20,495 --> 00:17:22,995
It's so good
to hear your voice, padre.

240
00:17:23,773 --> 00:17:27,323
I have been searching for you
for so long. You have no idea.

241
00:17:28,463 --> 00:17:30,371
The others have lost faith.

242
00:17:31,622 --> 00:17:33,022
Dickless heathens.

243
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,428
- But not me.
- You've done well.

244
00:17:38,513 --> 00:17:39,513
So...

245
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:43,216
- How do i bust you out?
- Lilith.

246
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:45,411
Lilith?

247
00:17:47,264 --> 00:17:48,564
Father, she's...

248
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,661
Trapped neck-deep in the pit.

249
00:17:53,395 --> 00:17:55,609
- It won't be easy.
- Lilith.

250
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:58,993
Lilith can break the seals.

251
00:18:00,535 --> 00:18:01,585
Yeah, okay.

252
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:07,584
- But what do i do?
- You must find me a child.

253
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:10,956
A very special child.

254
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,051
What do you mean?

255
00:18:17,544 --> 00:18:18,594
What child?

256
00:18:22,123 --> 00:18:24,322
- You got to be kidding me.
- What?

257
00:18:24,547 --> 00:18:27,477
Get this. St. Mary's abandoned in'72

258
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,872
after a priest
disemboweled eight nuns.

259
00:18:30,573 --> 00:18:32,710
What's black and white
and red all over?

260
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:35,722
That's not funny.
The priest said it wasn't his fault.

261
00:18:35,805 --> 00:18:39,021
He said a demon made him do it and that
he even remembered the demon's name.

262
00:18:39,104 --> 00:18:40,534
- Yeah?
- Azazel.

263
00:18:43,686 --> 00:18:47,299
So, Lilith, yellow-eyes.
All the a-listers are paying visits.

264
00:18:47,482 --> 00:18:49,210
Certainly gives the joint
credibility.

265
00:18:49,293 --> 00:18:51,212
As a place
where the final seal goes down.

266
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:52,671
It's good enough for me.

267
00:18:53,303 --> 00:18:55,141
Let's pack up nurse betty
and hit the road.

268
00:18:55,224 --> 00:18:57,259
Hey, maybe... look.

269
00:18:57,826 --> 00:19:00,476
- What?
- Maybe we can find another demon.

270
00:19:03,572 --> 00:19:07,398
Sam, no. That blubbery
"don't hurt me" crap, it's just an act.

271
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,730
- She's playing you.
- I'm not so sure.

272
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,680
Even if she's not, there's still
a hell-bitch snoozing in there.

273
00:19:12,763 --> 00:19:15,652
I mean, come on. It's not like you
haven't done this before, right?

274
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:31,235
Just listen to me, okay?
My name is Cindy Mccellen.

275
00:19:31,318 --> 00:19:33,704
I'm a nurse in the nicu
over at Enfield memorial.

276
00:19:33,787 --> 00:19:35,480
I have a husband
named Matthew, okay?

277
00:19:35,563 --> 00:19:37,953
We've been married 6 years.
He's got to be worried sick about me.

278
00:19:38,036 --> 00:19:40,711
And i don't even know who you are,
And i'm not gonna tell anybody anything.

279
00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:41,971
Please just let me go.

280
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:43,311
No!

281
00:19:47,652 --> 00:19:49,062
Please, no!

282
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:03,668
You asked to see me?

283
00:20:07,183 --> 00:20:09,249
Yeah, listen, i need something.

284
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:10,866
Anything you wish.

285
00:20:10,949 --> 00:20:12,514
I need you to take me to see Sam.

286
00:20:12,597 --> 00:20:13,378
Why?

287
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,373
There's something
i got to talk to him about.

288
00:20:15,456 --> 00:20:16,647
What's that?

289
00:20:17,243 --> 00:20:19,288
The B.M. I took this morning.
What's it to you?

290
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:20,484
Just make it snappy.

291
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,553
I don't think that's wise.

292
00:20:24,142 --> 00:20:26,004
Well, i didn't ask you
for your opinion.

293
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,602
Have you forgotten what happened
the last time you met?

294
00:20:30,443 --> 00:20:31,182
No.

295
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:33,212
That's the whole point.

296
00:20:34,665 --> 00:20:36,830
Listen, i'm gonna do
whatever you mooks want, okay?

297
00:20:36,913 --> 00:20:39,571
I just need to tie up this one thing.
Five minutes... that's all i need.

298
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:41,940
No.

299
00:20:45,031 --> 00:20:46,246
What do you mean, no?

300
00:20:48,128 --> 00:20:49,717
Are you saying
that i'm trapped here?

301
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,302
You can go wherever you want.

302
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:52,717
Super.
I want to go see sam.

303
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:53,877
Except there.

304
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,087
- I want to take a walk.
- Fine. I'll go with you.

305
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,481
- Alone.
- No.

306
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:00,896
You know what? Screw this noise.
I'm out of here.

307
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:04,253
Through what door?

308
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:20,797
Damn it.

309
00:21:27,263 --> 00:21:29,423
What are you... a 12-year-old girl?
Just play it already.

310
00:21:29,506 --> 00:21:30,788
Mind your own business.

311
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,194
God, i wish she would just shut up.

312
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:39,378
Well, that can be arranged.

313
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:41,758
I don't get it.

314
00:21:42,113 --> 00:21:45,083
All the demons you cut with the knife...
What do you think happens to the host?

315
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,410
How is this any different?

316
00:21:46,493 --> 00:21:48,362
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

317
00:21:48,445 --> 00:21:50,379
I know that you're having
a tough time here, Sam,

318
00:21:50,462 --> 00:21:51,942
But we're in the final lap here.

319
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:53,993
Now is not the time
to grow a persqueeter.

320
00:21:54,076 --> 00:21:56,280
Would you drop the friggin'attitude?

321
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,061
I'm about to bleed and drink
an innocent woman while she watches.

322
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:02,297
And save the world as a result.

323
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,451
I don't know.
I just...

324
00:22:09,276 --> 00:22:11,411
I'm starting to think...

325
00:22:11,494 --> 00:22:12,847
Maybe Dean was right.

326
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,874
- About what?
- About everything.

327
00:22:22,566 --> 00:22:24,457
We're gonna see
this through, right, Sam?

328
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,593
Sam?

329
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,682
Son of a bitch.

330
00:22:51,056 --> 00:22:54,014
Quit hurling feces
like a howler monkey, would you?

331
00:22:54,345 --> 00:22:55,307
It's unbecoming.

332
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,457
Let me out of here.

333
00:22:56,814 --> 00:22:58,576
Like i told you...
too dangerous out there.

334
00:22:58,659 --> 00:22:59,745
Demons on the prowl.

335
00:22:59,828 --> 00:23:01,532
I've been getting
my ass kicked all year.

336
00:23:01,615 --> 00:23:03,120
Now you're sweating my safety?

337
00:23:03,203 --> 00:23:04,084
You're lying.

338
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,297
I want to see my brother.

339
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:09,012
That's... ill-advised.

340
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,302
You know, i am so sick
of your crap riddles

341
00:23:11,385 --> 00:23:12,739
And your smug, fat face.

342
00:23:12,822 --> 00:23:14,434
What the hell is going on?

343
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:15,865
Why can't i see Sam?

344
00:23:16,077 --> 00:23:17,478
And how am i gonna ice Lilith?

345
00:23:20,427 --> 00:23:21,285
You're not.

346
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:23,693
... going to ice lilith.

347
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,422
What?

348
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,468
Lilith's going to break
the final seal.

349
00:23:29,486 --> 00:23:31,008
Fait accompli at this point.

350
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:32,577
Train's left the station.

351
00:23:35,737 --> 00:23:37,585
But me and Sam, we can stop...

352
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:45,150
You don't want to stop it, do you?

353
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:46,022
Nope.

354
00:23:46,105 --> 00:23:47,018
Never did.

355
00:23:47,505 --> 00:23:48,574
The end is nigh.

356
00:23:48,657 --> 00:23:52,326
The apocalypse is coming, kiddo,
to a theater near you.

357
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:56,851
What was all that crap
about saving seals?

358
00:23:57,783 --> 00:23:59,072
Our grunts on the ground...

359
00:23:59,155 --> 00:24:01,485
We couldn't just tell them
the whole truth.

360
00:24:01,568 --> 00:24:04,022
We'd have a full-scale
rebellion on our hands.

361
00:24:04,105 --> 00:24:05,322
I mean, think about it...

362
00:24:05,405 --> 00:24:08,012
Would we really
let 65 seals get broken

363
00:24:08,095 --> 00:24:10,268
unless senior management
wanted it that way?

364
00:24:12,123 --> 00:24:12,867
But why?

365
00:24:13,217 --> 00:24:14,697
Why not?

366
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,204
The apocalypse.

367
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,735
Poor name, bad marketing...
puts people off.

368
00:24:18,818 --> 00:24:21,791
When all it is is ali/foreman...

369
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:23,426
On a...
slightly larger scale.

370
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:25,254
And we like our chances.

371
00:24:26,045 --> 00:24:28,323
When our side wins...
and we will...

372
00:24:29,532 --> 00:24:31,052
It's paradise on earth.

373
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,048
Now, what's not to like about that?

374
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:37,668
What happens to all the people

375
00:24:37,751 --> 00:24:39,283
During your little pissing contest?

376
00:24:40,293 --> 00:24:41,060
Well...

377
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:44,320
You can't make an omelet
without cracking a few eggs.

378
00:24:44,403 --> 00:24:46,807
In this case...
truckloads of eggs,

379
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,295
But you get the picture.

380
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,966
Look...

381
00:24:53,063 --> 00:24:54,542
It happens.

382
00:24:55,422 --> 00:24:59,505
This isn't the first
planetary enema we've delivered.

383
00:25:02,615 --> 00:25:03,751
No, Dean.

384
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,610
Probably shouldn't try to bash
my skull in with that thing.

385
00:25:06,693 --> 00:25:08,422
Wouldn't end up
too pleasant for you.

386
00:25:11,846 --> 00:25:13,145
What about Sam?

387
00:25:13,915 --> 00:25:15,888
He won't go quietly.
He'll stop Lilith.

388
00:25:17,631 --> 00:25:20,790
Sam...
has a part to play.

389
00:25:21,414 --> 00:25:22,854
A very important part.

390
00:25:24,102 --> 00:25:26,710
He may need a little nudging
in the right direction,

391
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:28,317
But i'll make sure he plays it.

392
00:25:29,822 --> 00:25:30,899
What does that mean?

393
00:25:32,815 --> 00:25:34,157
What are you gonna do to him?

394
00:25:35,474 --> 00:25:36,859
Forget about him, would you?

395
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,022
You have larger concerns.

396
00:25:41,928 --> 00:25:43,552
Why do you think
i'm confiding in you?

397
00:25:43,635 --> 00:25:45,710
You're still vital, Dean.

398
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,550
We weren't lying about your destiny.

399
00:25:48,456 --> 00:25:51,507
Just... omitted
a few pertinent details.

400
00:25:51,827 --> 00:25:54,862
But nothing's changed.
You are chosen.

401
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:56,247
You will stop it.

402
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:59,349
Just...
not Lilith or the apocalypse.

403
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:00,466
That's all.

404
00:26:01,366 --> 00:26:02,699
Which means?

405
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,464
Lucifer.

406
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:10,966
You're going to stop lucifer.

407
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,029
You're our own little russell crowe,

408
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,098
complete with surly attitude.

409
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,464
And when it's over...

410
00:26:19,223 --> 00:26:20,651
And when you've won...

411
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:22,914
Your rewards will be...

412
00:26:23,355 --> 00:26:26,331
Unimaginable.
Peace, happiness...

413
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:29,169
2 virgins and 70 sluts.

414
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:33,767
Trust me... one day, we'll look
back on this and laugh.

415
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:34,992
Tell me something.

416
00:26:38,198 --> 00:26:40,139
Where's god in all this?

417
00:26:41,156 --> 00:26:42,233
God?

418
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,228
God has left the building.

419
00:27:21,935 --> 00:27:22,807
Howdy.

420
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,521
Lady, this is private property.

421
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,238
You're not supposed to be here.

422
00:27:30,321 --> 00:27:31,713
But i'm here for mass.

423
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:33,401
And so are you.

424
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:47,238
You can't reach him, Dean.

425
00:27:48,157 --> 00:27:49,750
You're outside your coverage zone.

426
00:27:51,561 --> 00:27:53,006
What are you gonna do to Sam?

427
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,551
Nothing.

428
00:27:57,353 --> 00:27:58,856
He's gonna do it to himself.

429
00:28:03,167 --> 00:28:04,557
What's that supposed to mean?

430
00:28:06,974 --> 00:28:08,207
Oh, right, right.

431
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:11,259
Got to toe the company line.

432
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,818
Why are you here, Cass?

433
00:28:16,985 --> 00:28:18,821
We've been through much
together, you and i,

434
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:22,241
And i just wanted to say,
i'm sorry it ended like this.

435
00:28:24,361 --> 00:28:25,414
"Sorry"?

436
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:35,773
It's armageddon, Cass.

437
00:28:35,856 --> 00:28:37,481
You need a bigger word than "sorry."

438
00:28:37,564 --> 00:28:40,546
Try to understand...
this is long foretold.

439
00:28:40,629 --> 00:28:42,371
- This is your...
- Destiny?

440
00:28:43,706 --> 00:28:45,710
Don't give me that "holy" crap.

441
00:28:46,315 --> 00:28:48,939
Destiny, god's plan...

442
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,920
It's all a bunch of lies,
you poor, stupid son of a bitch!

443
00:28:53,003 --> 00:28:56,317
It's just a way for your bosses
to keep me and keep you in line!

444
00:28:57,924 --> 00:28:59,060
You know what's real?

445
00:29:00,035 --> 00:29:03,264
People, families...
that's real.

446
00:29:03,587 --> 00:29:05,201
And you're gonna
watch them all burn?

447
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:06,899
What is so worth saving?

448
00:29:07,594 --> 00:29:10,081
I see nothing but pain here.

449
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,047
I see inside you.

450
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:15,795
I see your guilt,
your anger, confusion.

451
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,994
In paradise, all is forgiven.

452
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,025
You'll be at peace.

453
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,051
Even with Sam.

454
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,856
You can take your peace...

455
00:29:34,216 --> 00:29:36,407
And shove it up your lily-white ass.

456
00:29:36,834 --> 00:29:39,311
'cause i'll take
the pain and the guilt.

457
00:29:39,394 --> 00:29:40,986
I'll even take sam as is.

458
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:44,232
It's a lot better than being
some stepford bitch in paradise.

459
00:29:44,512 --> 00:29:46,033
This is simple, Cass!

460
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,779
No more crap
about being a good soldier.

461
00:29:49,434 --> 00:29:51,237
There is a right
and there is a wrong here,

462
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,157
and you know it.
Look at me!

463
00:29:53,518 --> 00:29:54,599
You know it!

464
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:58,565
You were gonna help me once,
weren't you?

465
00:29:58,648 --> 00:30:00,312
You were gonna warn me
about all this,

466
00:30:00,395 --> 00:30:02,265
before they dragged you
back to bible camp.

467
00:30:02,348 --> 00:30:03,934
Help me... now.

468
00:30:04,187 --> 00:30:05,093
Please.

469
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,639
What would you have me do?

470
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,070
Get me to Sam. We can stop this
before it's too late.

471
00:30:11,153 --> 00:30:13,898
I do that, we will all be hunted.

472
00:30:14,219 --> 00:30:15,582
We'll all be killed.

473
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:20,248
If there is anything
worth dying for...

474
00:30:20,943 --> 00:30:21,821
This is it.

475
00:30:29,738 --> 00:30:31,929
You spineless...

476
00:30:32,605 --> 00:30:34,387
Soulless son of a bitch.

477
00:30:35,952 --> 00:30:38,476
What do you care about dying?
You're already dead.

478
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,664
We're done.

479
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:42,826
- Dean...
- We're done.

480
00:31:02,918 --> 00:31:05,012
Sam, it's time.
Are we doing this or not?

481
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:09,300
Give me a minute to think.

482
00:31:09,383 --> 00:31:11,577
- Sam...
- Give me a damn minute, ruby!

483
00:31:14,254 --> 00:31:15,289
Better think fast.

484
00:31:25,733 --> 00:31:27,186
First unheard message.

485
00:31:29,069 --> 00:31:31,120
Listen to me,
you bloodsucking freak.

486
00:31:31,427 --> 00:31:33,891
Dad always said i'd either
have to save you or kill you.

487
00:31:34,566 --> 00:31:36,327
Well, i'm giving you fair warning.

488
00:31:36,714 --> 00:31:38,464
I'm done trying to save you.

489
00:31:38,851 --> 00:31:41,362
You're a monster, Sam... a vampire.

490
00:31:41,843 --> 00:31:43,432
You're not you anymore.

491
00:31:43,632 --> 00:31:45,262
And there's no going back.

492
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,828
Do it.

493
00:32:08,284 --> 00:32:09,677
Thank god.

494
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,945
Castiel!

495
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,485
Would you mind explaining
just what the hell you're doing?

496
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,368
He won't be gone long.

497
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,662
We have to find sam now.

498
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:21,206
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

499
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,625
But i know who does.

500
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:25,461
We have to stop him, Dean,
from killing Lilith.

501
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:27,421
But lilith's gonna break
the final seal.

502
00:33:27,504 --> 00:33:29,173
Lilith is the final seal.

503
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:32,217
She dies, the end begins.

504
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,893
That sounds... moist.

505
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,188
Uh, what are your rates?

506
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:48,152
We can get you one girl,
one hour... $1,000.

507
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:49,822
Okay.

508
00:33:50,176 --> 00:33:53,077
Then, uh, i'll take 20 girls
for the whole night.

509
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:55,978
Um, sir, i'm not sure
you can afford that.

510
00:33:56,061 --> 00:33:58,960
Lady, sometimes you got to live
like there's no tomorrow.

511
00:34:01,068 --> 00:34:03,097
- This isn't supposed to happen.
- Sir?

512
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,724
No, lady, this is definitely
supposed to happen,

513
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:07,323
but i just got to call you back.

514
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:23,852
Don't be afraid.

515
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:27,106
We're going to save the world.

516
00:34:49,803 --> 00:34:51,657
St. Mary's?
What is it, a convent?

517
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,095
Yeah, but you guys
aren't supposed to be there.

518
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:55,540
You're not in this story.

519
00:34:55,623 --> 00:34:56,677
Yeah, well...

520
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,323
We're making it up as we go.

521
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,934
Aw, man! Not again!

522
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,479
It's the archangel!

523
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,970
I'll hold him off!
I'll hold them all off!

524
00:35:10,053 --> 00:35:11,437
Just stop Sam!

525
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:09,704
I've been waiting for this...

526
00:36:11,541 --> 00:36:13,128
For a very long time.

527
00:36:14,018 --> 00:36:16,572
Then give me your best shot.

528
00:36:31,094 --> 00:36:31,885
Sam!

529
00:36:36,724 --> 00:36:37,650
Sam!

530
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:44,916
Sam!

531
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:46,703
Dean?

532
00:36:48,669 --> 00:36:51,201
What are you waiting for?!

533
00:36:51,907 --> 00:36:52,827
Now!

534
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,051
Sam, now!

535
00:37:11,058 --> 00:37:13,272
You turned yourself into a freak.

536
00:37:14,855 --> 00:37:16,108
A monster.

537
00:37:16,605 --> 00:37:18,765
And now you're not gonna bite?

538
00:37:20,434 --> 00:37:23,323
I'm sorry, but that is
honestly adorable.

539
00:38:21,381 --> 00:38:22,387
You did it.

540
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,202
I mean, it was a little
touch-and-go there for a while,

541
00:38:25,285 --> 00:38:27,054
but... you did it.

542
00:38:27,961 --> 00:38:29,765
What?
What... what did i do?

543
00:38:30,423 --> 00:38:31,808
You opened the door.

544
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:35,045
And now he's free at last.

545
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,397
He's free at last.

546
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,413
No, no, no.

547
00:38:38,496 --> 00:38:40,859
No, he... Lilith...
I stopped her. I killed her!

548
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,460
And it is written

549
00:38:42,543 --> 00:38:44,655
That the first demon
shall be the last seal.

550
00:38:46,384 --> 00:38:48,183
And you bust her open.

551
00:38:48,908 --> 00:38:51,113
Now guess who's coming to dinner.

552
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,968
Oh, my god.

553
00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:56,515
Guess again.

554
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,172
You don't even know
how hard this was...

555
00:39:03,255 --> 00:39:05,710
All the demons out for my head.

556
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:06,845
No one knew.

557
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,383
I was the best
of those sons of bitches!

558
00:39:09,633 --> 00:39:11,436
The most loyal!

559
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:13,590
Not even Alastair knew!

560
00:39:13,673 --> 00:39:14,726
Only Lilith!

561
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,937
Yeah, i'm sure you're
a little angry right now,

562
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,605
But, i mean, come on, Sam!

563
00:39:18,927 --> 00:39:22,484
Even you have to admit...
i'm... i'm awesome!

564
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:23,610
You bitch.

565
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,530
You lying bitch!

566
00:39:35,238 --> 00:39:38,377
Don't hurt yourself, Sammy.
It's useless.

567
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:40,627
You shot your payload on the boss.

568
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:45,882
The blood...

569
00:39:46,703 --> 00:39:48,434
You poisoned me.

570
00:39:49,157 --> 00:39:49,917
No.

571
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,020
It wasn't the blood.

572
00:39:52,788 --> 00:39:55,320
It was you...
and your choices.

573
00:39:55,403 --> 00:39:56,839
I just gave you the options,

574
00:39:56,922 --> 00:39:59,644
and you chose the right path
every time.

575
00:40:02,248 --> 00:40:03,879
You didn't need the feather to fly.

576
00:40:03,962 --> 00:40:06,194
You had it in you
the whole time, dumbo.

577
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,937
I know it's hard to see it now...

578
00:40:11,772 --> 00:40:15,256
But this is a miracle
so long coming.

579
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:19,096
Everything Azazel did and Lilith did

580
00:40:19,179 --> 00:40:21,467
just to get you here.

581
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:24,713
And you were the only one
who could do it.

582
00:40:25,162 --> 00:40:25,980
Why?

583
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:29,353
Why me?

584
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,968
Because...

585
00:40:32,661 --> 00:40:34,347
because it had to be you, Sammy.

586
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:37,448
It always had to be you.

587
00:40:39,218 --> 00:40:40,976
You saved us.

588
00:40:41,059 --> 00:40:42,896
You set him free.

589
00:40:42,979 --> 00:40:44,799
And he's gonna be grateful.

590
00:40:44,882 --> 00:40:49,071
He's gonna repay you in ways
that you can't even imagine.

591
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:55,400
You're too late.

592
00:40:55,483 --> 00:40:56,835
I don't care.

593
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:20,977
I'm sorry.

594
00:41:33,209 --> 00:41:35,742
- Sammy, let's go.
- Dean...

595
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:40,663
He's coming.
