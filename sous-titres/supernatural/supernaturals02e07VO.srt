1
00:00:00,455 --> 00:00:02,085
Dad wants us to pick up
where he left off.

2
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:04,167
Saving people, hunting things.

3
00:00:04,168 --> 00:00:05,484
The family business.

4
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:09,556
You still running credit-card scams?

5
00:00:09,557 --> 00:00:10,954
You think credit-card fraud is easy?

6
00:00:10,955 --> 00:00:13,063
- Okay, Mr. Burkowitz.
- Federal marshals.

7
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:14,979
- Environmental study majors.
- I'm father Simmons.

8
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,882
U.S. Wildlife service.
Nigel Tuffnel.

9
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:19,701
- Dr. Jerry Kaplan. Art dealers. Rangers.
- Reporters. Students.

10
00:00:19,708 --> 00:00:22,833
- Fraternity brothers.
- Homeland security? Pretty illegal, even for us.

11
00:00:22,836 --> 00:00:25,632
S.W.A.T. team discovered
a local woman bound and gagged.

12
00:00:25,628 --> 00:00:29,607
Her attacker, a white male
approximately 24 to 30 years of age,

13
00:00:29,608 --> 00:00:32,198
- was discovered hiding in the home.
- Shapeshifter?

14
00:00:32,235 --> 00:00:34,287
Every culture in the world
has a shapeshifter lore,

15
00:00:34,294 --> 00:00:37,713
legends of creatures who can transform
themselves into animals or other men.

16
00:00:43,062 --> 00:00:47,154
Cops are blaming this Dean Winchester guy
for Emily's murder.

17
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,983
- Sorry I'm gonna miss it.
- Miss what?

18
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,365
How many chances am I gonna have
to see my own funeral?

19
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:04,728
Under what name?

20
00:01:05,452 --> 00:01:08,093
Oh, yeah, that's my favorite so far.

21
00:01:09,008 --> 00:01:11,495
Possible I.D.S in three states
that we know of.

22
00:01:15,137 --> 00:01:16,443
I got to call you back.

23
00:01:23,832 --> 00:01:24,656
Wow.

24
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:30,034
First I thought
you were just stepping up your game.

25
00:01:31,012 --> 00:01:32,219
Credit-card fraud,

26
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,041
breaking and entering.
This one,

27
00:01:35,267 --> 00:01:36,356
a puzzle...

28
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:38,247
Grave desecration.

29
00:01:39,887 --> 00:01:42,903
But still, these are a long way from murder.

30
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,099
Then we get a fax from St. Louis...

31
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:51,379
where you're suspected of torturing
and murdering a young woman.

32
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:55,124
However, no one could prove anything,
of course, because

33
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,886
supposedly you died there.

34
00:02:00,257 --> 00:02:01,823
But I got to tell you something.

35
00:02:03,463 --> 00:02:05,648
You look pretty healthy to me.

36
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,918
So, now we know Karen Giles
wasn't the first person you murdered.

37
00:02:13,377 --> 00:02:15,496
Going somewhere, Sam?

38
00:02:17,144 --> 00:02:19,239
But I guarantee you she's the last.

41
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:43,447
Thought you might be thirsty.

42
00:02:43,453 --> 00:02:45,056
Okay, so you're the good cop.

43
00:02:46,354 --> 00:02:48,907
- Where's the bad cop?
- He's with your brother.

44
00:02:48,913 --> 00:02:51,014
Okay. And you're holding us why?

45
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:53,144
He's being held on suspicion of murder.

46
00:02:53,152 --> 00:02:55,913
- And you? We'll see.
- Murder?

47
00:02:55,921 --> 00:02:58,485
You sound genuinely surprised.

48
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:00,624
Or are you that good of an actor?

49
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,181
Who is he supposed to have murdered?

50
00:03:02,187 --> 00:03:04,393
- We'll get around to that.
- You can't just hold us here

51
00:03:04,405 --> 00:03:07,678
- without formal charges.
- Actually, we can for 48 hours.

52
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,240
But you, being a prelaw student,
would know that.

53
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,280
I know all about you, Sam.

54
00:03:14,574 --> 00:03:15,969
You're 23 years old.

55
00:03:16,172 --> 00:03:17,956
No job, no home address.

56
00:03:18,984 --> 00:03:20,878
Your mother died when you were a baby.

57
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,845
Your father's whereabouts are unknown.

58
00:03:24,022 --> 00:03:25,366
And then there's

59
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,973
the case of your brother, Dean,

60
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,554
whose demise was, well,
just a little bit exaggerated.

61
00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:32,622
Feel free to jump in whenever you like.

62
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:35,953
Shy?

63
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,079
No problem.

64
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:38,111
I'll keep going.

65
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:40,959
Your family moved around a lot
when you were a kid.

66
00:03:41,076 --> 00:03:43,770
Despite that, you were a straight-A student.

67
00:03:43,885 --> 00:03:46,380
Got into Stanford with a full ride.

68
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,975
Then about a year ago,

69
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:52,685
there was a fire in your apartment.

70
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,054
One fatality...

71
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,276
Jessica Moore,

72
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:56,523
your girlfriend.

73
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,484
After she died, you fell off the grid,
left behind everything.

74
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,301
I needed some time off...

75
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:05,860
to deal.

76
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:09,749
So I'm taking a road trip with my brother.

77
00:04:09,755 --> 00:04:12,192
- How's that going for you?
- Great.

78
00:04:13,365 --> 00:04:14,509
I mean...

79
00:04:15,386 --> 00:04:18,998
we saw the second-largest ball of twine
in the continental US.

80
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:21,117
Awesome.

81
00:04:22,983 --> 00:04:25,666
We ran Dean's fingerprints through iafis.

82
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,006
Got over a dozen possible hits.

83
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:31,704
"Possible" hits, which makes them worthless.

84
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,093
But  makes you wonder,

85
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,844
what are we gonna find
when we run your prints?

86
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:37,733
Yeah, well, uh...

87
00:04:38,327 --> 00:04:40,242
you be sure to let me know, all right?

88
00:04:40,838 --> 00:04:41,860
May I?

89
00:04:41,925 --> 00:04:43,519
- Please.
- Great.

90
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:51,959
Sam, you seem like a good kid.

91
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:54,226
It's not your fault Dean's your brother.

92
00:04:54,232 --> 00:04:56,097
We can't pick our family.

93
00:04:57,201 --> 00:05:00,223
Right now detectives in St. Louis
are exhuming a corpse.

94
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:03,314
They're trying to figure out
how your brother faked his own death

95
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,952
after torturing all those young women.

96
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,923
Dean's a bad guy.

97
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:09,500
His life is over.

98
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:11,911
Yours doesn't have to be.

99
00:05:14,076 --> 00:05:16,510
You want me to turn against my own brother?

100
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:19,500
No.
We already caught him cold,

101
00:05:19,872 --> 00:05:22,827
red-handed at the Karen Giles murder scene.

102
00:05:24,344 --> 00:05:26,408
We just need you

103
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,457
to fill in some missing pieces.

104
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:30,984
Why would I do that?

105
00:05:34,348 --> 00:05:36,705
Because I can talk to the D.A.,

106
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,292
make a deal for you.

107
00:05:38,676 --> 00:05:40,433
You can get on with your life.

108
00:05:41,136 --> 00:05:42,831
Dean's as good as gone.

109
00:05:49,493 --> 00:05:52,440
My dad and Tony Giles were old friends.

110
00:05:53,205 --> 00:05:55,608
They were in the service together.

111
00:05:55,612 --> 00:05:58,325
We've known him since we were kids,
you know?

112
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,106
So we came as soon as we heard
about his death.

113
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:08,509
Here you go.

114
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:11,654
- Anthony Giles.
- Who's Anthony Giles?

115
00:06:11,922 --> 00:06:13,792
The Baltimore lawyer.

116
00:06:13,858 --> 00:06:15,576
Working late at office. Check it out.

117
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,318
"His throat was slit but the room was clean"

118
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:25,158
- Huh. No dna, no prints.
- Keep reading. It gets better.

119
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:28,700
"Security cameras failed to capture footage
of the assailant"

120
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:31,256
Either somebody tampered with the tapes...

121
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:32,737
or it's an invisible killer.

122
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:34,372
My favorite kind.

123
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,266
What do you think, Scully?
We check it out?

124
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm not Scully. You're Scully.

125
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:39,484
No, I'm Mulder.

126
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:40,343
You're  a redheaded woman.

127
00:06:41,982 --> 00:06:42,764
So...

128
00:06:44,011 --> 00:06:46,149
It would've been hard for Dean
to kill Tony,

129
00:06:46,225 --> 00:06:48,309
considering we weren't in town
at the time.

130
00:06:48,315 --> 00:06:49,854
So, tell me what happened next.

131
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:51,417
Okay, uh,

132
00:06:51,768 --> 00:06:53,445
that's when we went to see Karen.

133
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:55,545
She was barely holding it together.

134
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:58,212
We just wanted to be there for her,
you know?

135
00:07:00,435 --> 00:07:02,160
Insurance.

136
00:07:03,368 --> 00:07:05,404
I totally forgot about the insurance.

137
00:07:06,603 --> 00:07:08,468
We're very sorry to bother you
right now, but

138
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:12,489
the company is required
to conduct its own investigation.

139
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,263
- You understand?
- Sure.

140
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,127
If you could just tell us anything

141
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:19,167
you remember about the night
your husband died.

142
00:07:20,143 --> 00:07:21,982
Tony and I were supposed to have dinner.

143
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:25,012
He called and said that he was having
computer troubles

144
00:07:25,365 --> 00:07:27,110
and that he had to work late.

145
00:07:28,577 --> 00:07:30,090
That was it.

146
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:33,963
Do you have any idea
who could've done this to him?

147
00:07:34,561 --> 00:07:37,918
No. It's like i told the police. I...

148
00:07:38,221 --> 00:07:39,709
I have no idea.

149
00:07:39,723 --> 00:07:41,360
Did Tony mention anything

150
00:07:41,366 --> 00:07:42,740
unusual

151
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:45,256
to you in the days before his death?

152
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:47,398
Unusual?

153
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:49,839
Yeah, like strange.

154
00:07:51,957 --> 00:07:54,093
- Strange?
- You know, Karen, weird.

155
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:55,976
Weird noises,

156
00:07:56,321 --> 00:07:58,416
visions, anything like that?

157
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:08,167
He had a nightmare the day before he died.

158
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,890
What kind of a nightmare?

159
00:08:11,855 --> 00:08:13,964
Uh, he said that he woke up
in the middle of the night,

160
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:16,426
and there was a woman standing at
the foot of the bed.

161
00:08:17,183 --> 00:08:20,520
He blinked. She was gone.
I mean, it was just a nightmare.

162
00:08:21,457 --> 00:08:22,970
Did he say what she looked like?

163
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:27,627
What the helle difference does it make
what she looked like?!

164
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:33,812
Uh, it's just our company is very thorough.

165
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,047
He said she was pale,
and she had dark, red eyes.

166
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:40,747
So I gave Karen a hug,

167
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,689
told her to call me
if she needed anything, and

168
00:08:44,444 --> 00:08:45,299
that was it.

169
00:08:46,132 --> 00:08:47,271
End of story.

170
00:08:49,056 --> 00:08:51,469
Sam, I am trying to help you here,

171
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,225
but you have got to be honest with me.

172
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:57,166
Now, we have an eyewitness,

173
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:59,446
someone who saw two men

174
00:08:59,848 --> 00:09:03,230
fitting your and your brother's description
breaking into Giles' office.

175
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:04,264
Ok, look,

176
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,821
Karen called us later, said that there was
some stuff she wanted from Tony's office,

177
00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:09,471
but the police weren't letting her in.

178
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,224
Like a picture of the two of them in Paris
and some other stuff.

179
00:09:13,523 --> 00:09:15,778
Look, it was wrong to enter a crime scene,
but

180
00:09:15,787 --> 00:09:17,200
she gave us the key.

181
00:09:30,823 --> 00:09:31,754
Hey.

182
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:35,010
Anthony Giles' body was found
right about here.

183
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:37,390
"Throat slit so deep,"

184
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:39,125
"that part of his spinal cord was visible".

185
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,026
What do you think?

186
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,445
Vengeful spirit?

187
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:45,731
-  Underline "vengeful"?
- Yeah. Maybe.

188
00:09:46,394 --> 00:09:49,006
I mean, he did see that woman
at the foot of his bed.

189
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:54,650
Look at this.

190
00:09:57,744 --> 00:09:59,016
"danashulps"

191
00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:01,493
What's that, a name?

192
00:10:03,138 --> 00:10:04,783
I don't know, but it's everywhere.

193
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:11,125
"All work and no play makes Jack
a dull boy"

194
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:34,511
I'd say we've officially crossed over
into weird.

195
00:10:34,758 --> 00:10:36,073
Maybe Giles knew her.

196
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:38,869
Maybe it's the name of our pale,
red-eyed mystery girl.

197
00:10:39,093 --> 00:10:40,186
Well...

198
00:10:41,003 --> 00:10:42,636
let's see what we can see.

199
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:50,986
There's not a single mention of
a Dana Shulps anywhere.

200
00:10:51,462 --> 00:10:52,724
There's not a D. Shulps

201
00:10:52,732 --> 00:10:54,261
or any other kind of freaking Shulps.

202
00:10:54,268 --> 00:10:55,250
Great.

203
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:56,818
- What do you got?
- Nothing.

204
00:10:56,826 --> 00:11:01,584
No Dana Shulps has ever lived or died
in Baltimore in the last 50 years at least.

205
00:11:01,593 --> 00:11:03,432
- So, what now?
- Well,

206
00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:05,533
I think I'm pretty close
to cracking Giles' password.

207
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,398
Maybe there's something
in his personal files, you know.

208
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:08,706
By "close" you mean...

209
00:11:09,063 --> 00:11:10,246
30 minutes maybe.

210
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,993
Awesome.

211
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:17,401
So, I guess I just get to, uh,

212
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:19,148
hang out.

213
00:11:19,274 --> 00:11:20,268
T hat's

214
00:11:20,322 --> 00:11:21,337
awesome.

215
00:11:35,307 --> 00:11:36,460
Dude, seriously.

216
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:38,039
Alright. I'm gonna go talk to Karen again,

217
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:40,178
see if she knows anything about
this Dana Shulps, huh?

218
00:11:40,463 --> 00:11:41,226
Great.

219
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,605
Keep going, sparky.

220
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:47,827
Then Dean went back to Karen's place
to check up on her.

221
00:11:47,963 --> 00:11:48,944
I mean,

222
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,211
you know,
she had been pretty upset earlier.

223
00:11:51,223 --> 00:11:52,826
So why didn't you go with him?

224
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:56,069
I just went back to the motel.

225
00:11:57,252 --> 00:11:59,213
How did you know I was there,
by the way?

226
00:11:59,658 --> 00:12:03,154
We found the motel matchbook on your brother
when we arrested him.

227
00:12:05,388 --> 00:12:07,129
Let's quit fooling around.

228
00:12:07,564 --> 00:12:10,365
Now, you were with your brother
the whole time you were in Baltimore.

229
00:12:10,369 --> 00:12:12,367
Why separate now?

230
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:15,083
Because your brother left you
to go murder Karen.

231
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:19,047
- He didn't kill anyone.
- I heard the 911 call!

232
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:22,602
Karen was terrified!
She said someone was in the house.

233
00:13:32,176 --> 00:13:34,641
- Emergency services.
- Hello?

234
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:36,607
I think I saw somebody in my house.

235
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:37,929
What is your address, ma'am?

236
00:13:37,938 --> 00:13:39,908
It's 421 Clinton avenue.

237
00:13:40,832 --> 00:13:41,971
Please...

238
00:13:42,709 --> 00:13:43,561
Hello?

239
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:34,842
Karen, are you in there?

240
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,079
Oh, god.

241
00:15:42,313 --> 00:15:43,832
Seriously, what the hell?

242
00:16:02,742 --> 00:16:03,987
Freeze.

243
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:05,292
Stay on your knees.

244
00:16:05,828 --> 00:16:07,229
Hands where I can see them.

245
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:08,630
Now!

246
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,588
Cuff him.

247
00:16:24,311 --> 00:16:25,756
You getting anywhere with him?

248
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:26,920
No.

249
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:29,438
Just a lot of wise ass remarks.

250
00:16:29,444 --> 00:16:30,449
You?

251
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:33,969
Sam's story matches Dean's
to the last detail.

252
00:16:35,148 --> 00:16:37,369
Yeah, well, these guys are good.

253
00:16:37,745 --> 00:16:38,924
I'll give them that.

254
00:16:40,963 --> 00:16:45,012
If we don't get Sam to flip, we have nothing
but a lot of circumstantial evidence.

255
00:16:45,027 --> 00:16:48,321
We got Dean at the crime scene
with blood on his hands.

256
00:16:48,687 --> 00:16:50,714
Juries have convicted for less.

257
00:16:51,305 --> 00:16:54,196
Yeah, but, I mean,
where is the murder weapon?

258
00:16:54,611 --> 00:16:57,174
What's the motive?
You talk about reasonable doubt.

259
00:16:57,179 --> 00:16:57,945
Diana...

260
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:00,171
do you

261
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:01,405
have reasonable doubt?

262
00:17:06,845 --> 00:17:09,800
We keep leaning on these guys,
one of them will tumble.

263
00:17:09,803 --> 00:17:11,775
And don't forget about St. Louis.

264
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:13,720
I'm telling you,

265
00:17:13,806 --> 00:17:15,013
this Dean guy

266
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,036
is our guy.

267
00:17:17,213 --> 00:17:19,406
I know Tony Giles was a friend of yours.

268
00:17:19,409 --> 00:17:21,340
Yeah,  he was. He was a good friend.

269
00:17:21,347 --> 00:17:24,037
I know you want to clean this mess up quick,

270
00:17:24,526 --> 00:17:27,275
but come on.
Tony knew a lot of criminal types.

271
00:17:27,283 --> 00:17:29,821
- Maybe we just...
- "Criminal types"?

272
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:34,446
He was a defense lawyer, for god sakes.
Of course he knew criminal types.

273
00:17:35,444 --> 00:17:36,461
Okay.

274
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:39,431
- All right. Let's get back at them.
- No. You know what?

275
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:41,784
Let them stew in their juices for a bit.

276
00:17:48,121 --> 00:17:49,377
Come here.

277
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:07,709
Dana Shulps, Dana Shulps,
Dana Shulps...

278
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:19,659
Maybe it's not a name.

279
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:22,299
Maybe it's not a name?

280
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,629
Anagram maybe?

281
00:18:41,297 --> 00:18:42,325
Mr. Winchester?

282
00:18:42,477 --> 00:18:43,304
Yeah.

283
00:18:43,511 --> 00:18:44,866
I'm Jeff Crouse.

284
00:18:45,815 --> 00:18:47,964
I'm with the public defender's office.

285
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,415
I'm your lawyer.

286
00:18:50,874 --> 00:18:53,410
Oh, thank god. I'm saved.

287
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,416
Can I, uh, steal a pen from you
and some paper?

288
00:18:57,422 --> 00:18:58,220
Sure.

289
00:19:00,197 --> 00:19:01,202
Well,

290
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,024
the

291
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,877
police haven't found a weapon yet.

292
00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:05,580
So that's good.

293
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:07,312
But, uh,

294
00:19:07,318 --> 00:19:08,796
they got your prints

295
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,676
and literally

296
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:13,252
blood on your hands. And

297
00:19:14,128 --> 00:19:15,296
with your police record...

298
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:19,881
Mr. Winchester,

299
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,868
- what are you doing?
- I think it's an anagram.

300
00:19:23,173 --> 00:19:26,545
- A what?
- An anagram. Same letters, different words.

301
00:19:28,161 --> 00:19:29,489
Could you do me a favor?

302
00:19:30,214 --> 00:19:32,462
See if you recognize any
of these words, you know.

303
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:34,894
Local names, places, anything like that.

304
00:19:36,112 --> 00:19:38,683
Do you understand how serious
these charges are?

305
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:42,476
I'm handcuffed to a table. Yeah. I get it.

306
00:19:42,562 --> 00:19:44,771
Humor me. Take a quick look.

307
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:54,616
Well, S-U-P?
I don't know about that, but...

308
00:19:55,954 --> 00:19:57,291
Ashland is

309
00:19:57,298 --> 00:19:58,782
is a street name.

310
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:00,558
It's not far from here.

311
00:20:00,563 --> 00:20:01,439
Street?

312
00:20:03,438 --> 00:20:07,349
Let's start with where you were
the night that Anthony Giles died.

313
00:20:07,353 --> 00:20:08,920
Can you get in to see my brother?

314
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:10,402
Mr. Winchester...

315
00:20:11,247 --> 00:20:13,717
you could be facing
the death penalty here.

316
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:16,072
Hey, thanks for the law review, Matlock.

317
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:18,667
But if you want to help me...

318
00:20:21,544 --> 00:20:23,354
I need you to see my brother.

319
00:21:06,874 --> 00:21:08,232
I hope that was meaningful.

320
00:21:09,424 --> 00:21:11,538
But I'd like to discuss your case now.

321
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:13,731
Sure thing, Matlock.

322
00:21:14,796 --> 00:21:16,946
You two really are brothers, aren't you?

323
00:21:17,697 --> 00:21:18,650
Now...

324
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:20,608
as you know,

325
00:21:21,267 --> 00:21:23,486
the D.A. might be interested in...

326
00:21:25,886 --> 00:21:27,939
We need you with the other one.

327
00:21:35,737 --> 00:21:37,357
This should be nice.

328
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:42,975
Counselor...

329
00:21:44,143 --> 00:21:45,813
your boy decided to confess.

330
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,268
Mr. Winchester,

331
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,877
I would advise against that strongly.

332
00:21:49,914 --> 00:21:51,682
Talk  directly into the camera.

333
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:53,564
Start by stating your name for the record.

334
00:21:57,467 --> 00:21:59,233
My name is Dean Winchester.

335
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:01,287
I'm an aquarius.

336
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:03,988
I enjoy sunsets, long walks on the beach,

337
00:22:04,094 --> 00:22:05,352
and frisky women.

338
00:22:06,148 --> 00:22:07,764
And I did not kill anyone,

339
00:22:08,408 --> 00:22:09,750
but I know who did.

340
00:22:09,752 --> 00:22:11,312
Or rather what did.

341
00:22:11,924 --> 00:22:13,364
Of course, it can't be for sure

342
00:22:13,371 --> 00:22:15,319
because our investigation was interrupted.

343
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:17,470
But our working theory

344
00:22:17,564 --> 00:22:19,106
is that we're looking for some kind of

345
00:22:19,368 --> 00:22:20,929
vengeful spirit.

346
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,434
Excuse me?

347
00:22:22,896 --> 00:22:24,754
You know, Casper, the bloodthirsty ghost.

348
00:22:26,564 --> 00:22:27,743
Tony Giles saw it.

349
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:30,216
I'll bet you cash money Karen did, too.

350
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:32,805
See, the interesting thing is the word
it leaves behind.

351
00:22:32,812 --> 00:22:33,774
For some reason,

352
00:22:33,778 --> 00:22:35,277
it's trying to tell us something.

353
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,247
But communicating across a veil

354
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:39,989
ain't easy.

355
00:22:40,605 --> 00:22:43,068
And sometimes the spirits,
they get things jumbled.

356
00:22:43,484 --> 00:22:44,655
You remember "Redrum".

357
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:46,137
Same concept.

358
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:47,594
You know,

359
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:49,519
it could be word fragments.

360
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:50,901
Other times...

361
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:55,257
It's anagrams.

362
00:22:56,348 --> 00:22:58,577
See, at first we thought
this was a name, Dana Shulps.

363
00:22:59,897 --> 00:23:00,745
But now

364
00:23:01,093 --> 00:23:02,470
we think it's a street.

365
00:23:02,475 --> 00:23:03,478
Ashland.

366
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,041
Whatever is going on,

367
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:09,734
- I'm betting it started there.
- You arrogant bastard.

368
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,273
Tony and Karen were good people,
and you're making jokes.

369
00:23:13,277 --> 00:23:14,886
I'm not joking, Ponch.

370
00:23:16,876 --> 00:23:20,916
You murdered them in cold blood
just like that girl in St. Louis.

371
00:23:20,923 --> 00:23:22,439
Oh, yeah, that wasn't me, either.

372
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:25,061
That was a shapeshifter creature
that only looked like me.

373
00:23:28,693 --> 00:23:30,133
Pete, that is enough!

374
00:23:31,942 --> 00:23:33,013
You asked for the truth.

375
00:23:36,136 --> 00:23:37,276
Lock this guy off.

376
00:23:50,444 --> 00:23:51,624
What the hell?

377
00:23:53,423 --> 00:23:54,684
Where is he?

378
00:24:03,978 --> 00:24:04,789
How did he do it?

379
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,111
The fire escape's way over...

380
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:11,427
- What?
- These two guys.

381
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,698
Hilts and Mcqueen?

382
00:24:17,092 --> 00:24:17,954
What is that?

383
00:24:18,008 --> 00:24:20,604
Hilts is Steve Mcqueen's character in
"The Great Escape".

384
00:25:19,305 --> 00:25:20,816
Can we make this quick?

385
00:25:20,928 --> 00:25:23,617
I'm really tired.
It's been a long day, you know,

386
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:25,232
with your partner assaulting me and all.

387
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:27,606
I want to know more about that stuff

388
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:30,040
- you were talking about earlier.
- Time life,

389
00:25:30,224 --> 00:25:31,693
"mysteries of the unknown".

390
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,108
Look it up.

391
00:25:37,841 --> 00:25:39,872
Let's pretend for the moment

392
00:25:40,396 --> 00:25:42,553
you're not entirely insane.

393
00:25:43,397 --> 00:25:47,232
What would one of these things
be doing here?

394
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:48,884
Vengeful spirit?

395
00:25:51,653 --> 00:25:54,281
Well, they're created by violent deaths,

396
00:25:54,574 --> 00:25:57,422
and then they come back for a reason,
usually a nasty one,

397
00:25:57,428 --> 00:25:59,586
like revenge on the people that hurt them.

398
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:02,498
And, uh, these

399
00:26:02,714 --> 00:26:04,163
spirits...

400
00:26:05,195 --> 00:26:07,473
They're capable of killing people.

401
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:14,134
Where did you get that?

402
00:26:20,064 --> 00:26:20,986
I don't know.

403
00:26:22,764 --> 00:26:23,935
It wasn't there before.

404
00:26:25,808 --> 00:26:27,277
You've seen it, haven't you?

405
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:29,054
The spirit.

406
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:30,257
How did you know?

407
00:26:30,486 --> 00:26:32,921
Because Karen had the same bruises
on her wrists.

408
00:26:33,874 --> 00:26:36,881
I'm willing to bet that if you look at
Giles' autopsy photos, he's got them, too.

409
00:26:36,885 --> 00:26:38,497
It's got something to do with the spirit.

410
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,213
I don't know what.

411
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:45,676
I know.

412
00:26:46,887 --> 00:26:48,158
You think you're going crazy.

413
00:26:48,754 --> 00:26:50,394
But let's skip that part, shall we?

414
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:53,602
Because the last two people
who saw this thing

415
00:26:54,026 --> 00:26:55,448
died pretty soon after.

416
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:58,550
You hear me?

417
00:27:01,698 --> 00:27:03,355
You think I'm gonna die.

418
00:27:03,402 --> 00:27:04,693
You need to go to Sam.

419
00:27:05,884 --> 00:27:07,265
He'll help.

420
00:27:09,284 --> 00:27:10,817
You're giving your brother up.

421
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:13,746
Go to the first motel listed
in the yellow pages.

422
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:14,903
Look for Jim Rockford.

423
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,681
That's how we find each other
when we're separated.

424
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:18,473
You can arrest him, if you want.

425
00:27:19,286 --> 00:27:20,640
Or you can let him save your life.

426
00:27:38,662 --> 00:27:40,198
These showed up after you saw it?

427
00:27:40,361 --> 00:27:41,230
Yeah,

428
00:27:41,496 --> 00:27:43,133
- I guess.
- All right.

429
00:27:44,127 --> 00:27:46,274
You're gonna have to tell me
exactly what you saw.

430
00:27:47,434 --> 00:27:49,389
You know, I must be losing my mind.

431
00:27:50,957 --> 00:27:52,354
You're a fugitive.

432
00:27:52,411 --> 00:27:53,847
I should be arresting you.

433
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,136
All right, well,

434
00:27:55,405 --> 00:27:57,420
you know what?
You can arrest me later, alright?

435
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,783
After you live through this.

436
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,907
But right now, you got to talk to me.

437
00:28:01,103 --> 00:28:02,257
Okay?

438
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:05,815
Okay. Great.

439
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:08,035
Now, the spirit, what did it look like?

440
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,297
She was, um,

441
00:28:10,215 --> 00:28:11,471
really pale...

442
00:28:12,296 --> 00:28:13,956
and her throat was cut.

443
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:16,837
And her eyes, they were like this deep,
dark red.

444
00:28:16,846 --> 00:28:19,454
It appeared like
she was trying to talk to me,

445
00:28:19,618 --> 00:28:21,095
but she couldn't.

446
00:28:21,903 --> 00:28:23,309
It was just...

447
00:28:23,315 --> 00:28:25,012
a lot of blood.

448
00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:28,788
You know what? Here.

449
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:32,232
I've been researching every girl who has ever
died or gone missing from Ashland street.

450
00:28:34,538 --> 00:28:35,967
How did you get those?

451
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:38,490
Those are from crime scenes
and booking photos.

452
00:28:39,486 --> 00:28:41,703
You have your job. I have mine.

453
00:28:42,641 --> 00:28:45,960
Here. I need you to look through these.
Tell me if you recognize anyone.

454
00:28:59,033 --> 00:29:00,111
This is her.

455
00:29:00,277 --> 00:29:01,353
I'm sure of it.

456
00:29:02,811 --> 00:29:03,994
Claire Becker?

457
00:29:04,672 --> 00:29:07,901
28 years old, disappeared about
eight or nine months ago.

458
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:09,393
But I don't even know her.

459
00:29:09,398 --> 00:29:11,305
Why would she come after me?

460
00:29:11,312 --> 00:29:12,176
Well,

461
00:29:12,464 --> 00:29:15,112
before her death,
she was arrested twice

462
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:16,313
for dealing heroin.

463
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,385
- You ever work narcotics?
- Yeah,

464
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,357
Pete and I did,

465
00:29:19,515 --> 00:29:20,819
before homicide.

466
00:29:21,495 --> 00:29:22,794
You ever bust her?

467
00:29:22,857 --> 00:29:24,234
Not that I remember.

468
00:29:27,746 --> 00:29:30,654
Says she was last seen entering
2911 Ashland street.

469
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:32,196
Police searched the place,

470
00:29:32,722 --> 00:29:33,989
didn't find anything.

471
00:29:36,537 --> 00:29:37,986
Guess we got to check it out ourselves,

472
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,657
see if we can find her body.

473
00:29:40,983 --> 00:29:41,741
What?

474
00:29:44,258 --> 00:29:46,045
Well, we got to salt and burn her bones.

475
00:29:46,483 --> 00:29:47,978
It's the only way to put her spirit to rest.

476
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:49,880
Of course it is.

477
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:07,790
So, what exactly are we looking for?

478
00:30:08,103 --> 00:30:09,714
I'll let you know when we find it.

479
00:31:04,338 --> 00:31:05,556
Sam!

480
00:31:16,254 --> 00:31:18,156
Hey, I'm here.
What is it?

481
00:31:18,481 --> 00:31:20,135
- What happened?
- Claire.

482
00:31:20,488 --> 00:31:22,122
- Where?
- She was here.

483
00:31:22,388 --> 00:31:23,412
Did she attack you?

484
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:26,541
No. No, she was just like
reaching out to me.

485
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,952
She was over there by the window.

486
00:31:41,128 --> 00:31:42,783
Here, help me move this.

487
00:31:43,697 --> 00:31:44,703
All right.

488
00:31:45,589 --> 00:31:46,710
I got it.

489
00:31:51,965 --> 00:31:53,717
Our little mystery word.

490
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:08,049
Now the extra letters make sense.

491
00:32:13,675 --> 00:32:14,916
What is that?

492
00:32:16,364 --> 00:32:20,158
Spirits and certain remains
give off electromagnetic frequencies.

493
00:32:21,392 --> 00:32:23,584
So, if Claire's body was here,

494
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,013
- that would indicate that?
- Yeah. Well, that's the theory.

495
00:32:52,766 --> 00:32:53,847
Yeah.

496
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,314
Yeah, there's definitely something in there.

497
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:02,295
You know,

498
00:33:03,121 --> 00:33:04,792
this is bothering me.

499
00:33:04,811 --> 00:33:06,909
Well, you are digging up a corpse.

500
00:33:06,913 --> 00:33:08,646
No, not that.

501
00:33:09,907 --> 00:33:12,075
That's, uh, pretty par for the course,
actually.

502
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,700
Then what?

503
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:14,604
It's just...

504
00:33:15,363 --> 00:33:18,814
I mean, no vengeful spirit
I've ever tussled with wanted to be wasted,

505
00:33:18,823 --> 00:33:21,810
so why the hell would Claire
lead us to her remains?

506
00:33:21,816 --> 00:33:23,528
Doesn't make any sense.

507
00:33:28,496 --> 00:33:29,557
All right. Here.

508
00:33:29,565 --> 00:33:30,537
Give me your hand.

509
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,242
Her wrists.

510
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:10,171
Yeah, they'd be bruised just like yours.

511
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,052
That necklace mean something to you?

512
00:34:24,976 --> 00:34:26,151
I've seen it before.

513
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:28,971
It's rare.

514
00:34:29,475 --> 00:34:31,611
It was custom-made over
on Carson street.

515
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,578
I have one just like it.

516
00:34:39,342 --> 00:34:40,635
Pete gave it to me.

517
00:34:45,394 --> 00:34:47,044
Now this all makes perfect sense.

518
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:48,225
I'm sorry?

519
00:34:48,232 --> 00:34:50,516
Yeah. You see,
Claire is not a vengeful spirit.

520
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:51,873
She's a death omen.

521
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:53,974
Excuse me?

522
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,542
Claire's not killing anyone.

523
00:34:56,908 --> 00:34:58,131
She's trying to warn them.

524
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:02,670
Sometimes spirits,
they don't want vengeance.

525
00:35:02,677 --> 00:35:05,380
They want justice, which is why
she led us here in the first place.

526
00:35:05,387 --> 00:35:07,509
She wants us to know who her killer is.

527
00:35:12,346 --> 00:35:14,889
Detective, how much do you know
about your partner?

528
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,523
- Oh, my god.
- What?

529
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:23,785
About a year ago,

530
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:26,754
some heroin went missing from lockup.

531
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:28,712
Obviously it was a cop.

532
00:35:29,407 --> 00:35:31,004
We never found out who did it.

533
00:35:32,437 --> 00:35:35,799
But whoever did it would need someone
to fence their product.

534
00:35:35,856 --> 00:35:37,251
Somebody like a heroin dealer.

535
00:35:39,285 --> 00:35:40,411
Somebody like Claire.

536
00:35:46,117 --> 00:35:48,644
So, I'm being extradited to St. Louis, huh?

537
00:35:51,604 --> 00:35:55,532
You just decided to transfer me yourself
800 miles at 2:00 in the morning?

538
00:36:00,582 --> 00:36:01,864
This can't be good.

539
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:04,047
All right. Thanks.

540
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:05,608
What is it?

541
00:36:05,793 --> 00:36:07,300
Pete just left the precinct.

542
00:36:07,536 --> 00:36:08,935
- With Dean.
- What?!

543
00:36:08,939 --> 00:36:12,329
He said the prisoner had to be transferred,
and he just took him.

544
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,286
Dispatch has been calling,
but he won't answer the radio.

545
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:16,365
Radio?

546
00:36:16,368 --> 00:36:18,436
- He took a county vehicle?
- Yeah.

547
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,883
Then it should have a lojack.
You just got to get it turned on.

548
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,635
Pee break? so soon.

549
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:37,803
So soon?

550
00:36:38,469 --> 00:36:40,376
I think you might want
to get your prostate checked.

551
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:51,419
Son of a bitch.

552
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:56,998
Hey, I'm cool in the van.
You go do what you got to do.

553
00:37:02,198 --> 00:37:03,983
You're a cocky son of a bitch.

554
00:37:05,147 --> 00:37:08,372
You think those people in St. Louis
are gonna buy that crap you're paddling?

555
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:10,582
Here's the thing.

556
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:12,995
You're not gonna make it to St. Louis.

557
00:37:14,152 --> 00:37:15,377
You're gonna die

558
00:37:15,752 --> 00:37:17,084
trying to escape.

559
00:37:19,901 --> 00:37:21,237
Wait! Wait!

560
00:37:22,883 --> 00:37:24,119
Let's talk about this.

561
00:37:24,124 --> 00:37:25,957
You don't want to do something
that you're gonna regret.

562
00:37:27,725 --> 00:37:29,209
- Or maybe you do.
- Pete!

563
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:30,829
Put the gun down.

564
00:37:31,094 --> 00:37:31,990
Diana?

565
00:37:32,836 --> 00:37:33,811
How'd you find me?

566
00:37:34,476 --> 00:37:35,739
I know about Claire.

567
00:37:35,747 --> 00:37:37,093
I don't know what you're talking about.

568
00:37:37,096 --> 00:37:38,923
Put the gun down!

569
00:37:38,927 --> 00:37:40,464
No, I don't think so.

570
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,244
You're fast.

571
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,205
Pretty sure I'm faster.

572
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,514
Why are you doing this?

573
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,384
I didn't do anything, Diana.

574
00:37:48,902 --> 00:37:50,324
It's a little late for that.

575
00:37:51,492 --> 00:37:52,836
It wasn't my fault.

576
00:37:53,733 --> 00:37:56,408
Claire was gonna turn me in.
I had no choice.

577
00:37:56,411 --> 00:37:57,477
And Tony?

578
00:37:57,851 --> 00:37:58,758
Karen?

579
00:37:58,861 --> 00:38:00,046
Same thing.

580
00:38:00,453 --> 00:38:02,859
Tony scrubbed the money.
Then he got skittish.

581
00:38:02,873 --> 00:38:04,680
And then he wanted to come clean.

582
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:06,470
I'm sure he told Karen everything.

583
00:38:07,226 --> 00:38:09,360
It was a mess. I had to clean it up.

584
00:38:10,527 --> 00:38:11,582
I just panicked.

585
00:38:11,796 --> 00:38:14,173
How many more people
are gonna die over this, Pete?

586
00:38:14,179 --> 00:38:15,634
There's a way out.

587
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,725
This Dean kid is a friggin' gift.

588
00:38:20,151 --> 00:38:22,124
We can pin the whole thing on him.

589
00:38:22,331 --> 00:38:26,417
Okay? No trial, nothing.
Just one more dead scumbag.

590
00:38:26,419 --> 00:38:27,374
Hey!

591
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:31,165
No one will question it.

592
00:38:31,994 --> 00:38:33,829
Diana, please.

593
00:38:34,274 --> 00:38:35,659
I still love you.

594
00:38:42,064 --> 00:38:43,141
Thank you.

595
00:38:45,086 --> 00:38:46,221
Thank you.

596
00:38:55,551 --> 00:38:58,713
Then why don't you buy me another necklace,
you ass?

597
00:39:01,433 --> 00:39:03,548
Don't do it. Don't do it.

598
00:39:51,941 --> 00:39:53,026
You're doing all right?

599
00:39:54,223 --> 00:39:55,227
Not really.

600
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,117
The death omen, Claire,

601
00:39:59,085 --> 00:40:00,479
what happens to her now?

602
00:40:00,676 --> 00:40:01,761
It should be over.

603
00:40:02,485 --> 00:40:03,849
She should be at rest.

604
00:40:05,587 --> 00:40:06,593
So, uh,

605
00:40:07,087 --> 00:40:08,443
what now, officer?

606
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,483
Pete did confess to me.

607
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:12,905
He screwed up both your cases royally.

608
00:40:12,982 --> 00:40:16,275
I'd say there's a good chance
that we can get your cases dismissed.

609
00:40:16,282 --> 00:40:18,918
- You could take care of that for us?
- I hope so.

610
00:40:19,113 --> 00:40:21,169
But the St. Louis murder charges?

611
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:23,080
That's another story.

612
00:40:23,525 --> 00:40:25,189
I.. I can't help you.

613
00:40:26,785 --> 00:40:28,243
Unless

614
00:40:28,387 --> 00:40:31,243
I just happened to turn my back
and you walked away.

615
00:40:31,247 --> 00:40:33,384
I could tell them
that the suspects escaped.

616
00:40:33,518 --> 00:40:35,654
- Wait. Are you sure?
- Yeah, she's sure, Sam.

617
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:38,517
You could lose your job over
something like that.

618
00:40:38,993 --> 00:40:41,626
Look, I just want you guys out there,
doing what you do best.

619
00:40:41,633 --> 00:40:42,527
Trust me.

620
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,029
I'll sleep better at night.

621
00:40:45,165 --> 00:40:46,459
Listen, you need to watch your back.

622
00:40:46,474 --> 00:40:48,490
They're gonna be looking for both of you
right now.

623
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:50,412
Get out of here.

624
00:40:50,918 --> 00:40:53,183
- I got to radio this in.
- Hey, uh...

625
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:56,085
You wouldn't happen to know where
my car is by chance?

626
00:40:56,088 --> 00:40:58,886
It's at the impound yard on Robertson.

627
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,097
Don't

628
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:04,406
- even think about it.
- It's okay. It's all right. Don't worry.

629
00:41:04,681 --> 00:41:07,210
We'll just improvise.
We're pretty good at that.

630
00:41:07,216 --> 00:41:08,940
Yeah. I've noticed.

631
00:41:14,864 --> 00:41:16,740
- Nice lady.
- Yeah, for a cop.

632
00:41:17,786 --> 00:41:19,271
Did she look familiar to you?

633
00:41:19,275 --> 00:41:20,151
No. Why?

634
00:41:20,376 --> 00:41:22,350
I don't know. It's nothing.
Hey, you hungry?

635
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,108
No.

636
00:41:23,116 --> 00:41:25,320
I have some reason
I could really go for some pea soup.
