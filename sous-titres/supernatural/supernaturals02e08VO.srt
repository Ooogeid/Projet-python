WHEN DID HE CALL
ANIMAL CONTROL?
TWO DAYS EARLIER.

46
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,600
DID HE ACTUALLY SAY
"BLACK DOG"?
YEAH.

47
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,100
"VICIOUS, WILD, BLACK DOG."

48
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,100
THE AUTHORITIES COULDN'T FIND
IT, AND NO ONE ELSE SAW IT.

49
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,900
IN FACT, THE AUTHORITIES
ARE A LITTLE CONFUSED

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,600

COULD GET PAST THE DOORMAN,

TAKE THE ELEVATOR UP,

52
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,900
AND START ROAMING THE HALLS
OF THE CUSHIEST JOINT IN TOWN.

53
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,400
AFTER THAT, NO MORE CALLS.
HE DOESN'T SHOW UP FOR WORK.

54
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,300

HE TAKES A SWAN DIVE.

WITH AN ACTUAL BLACK DOG?

IT'S ALL PRETTY VAGUE.

00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,300
THERE ARE SPECTRAL BLACK DOGS
ALL OVER THE WORLD,

59
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,600
BUT SOME SAY THEY'RE ANIMAL
SPIRITS, OTHERS SAY DEATH OMENS.

60
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,700
BUT ANYWAYS, WHATEVER THEY ARE,
THEY'RE BIG, NASTY...

61
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,700
YEAH, BET THEY COULD HUMP
THE CRAP OUT OF YOUR LEG.

HUH? [ CHUCKLES ]

00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,100

THIS IS FOR...

68
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,400
A TRIBUTE FOR MR. BOYDEN --
 <i>ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST.</i>

69
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,200
FUNNY TO YOU?

70
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,600
NO, IT --
IT'S JUST A TRIBUTE.

71
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,100
YEAH.

72
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,100
SEE, SEAN ALWAYS GOT
THE TRIBUTES.

73
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,900
HE KILLS HIMSELF, LEAVES ME
AND HIS FAMILY BEHIND,

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,100
BUT HE GETS ANOTHER TRIBUTE.

75
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,700
RIGHT.

76
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,100
ANY IDEA WHY HE'D DO
SUCH A THING?

77
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,700
I HAVE NO CLUE.
HE LIVED A CHARMED LIFE.

78
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,300
HOW SO?

79
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,500
HE WAS A FLAT-OUT GENIUS.

80
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,200
I MEAN, I'M CAPABLE,
BUT, NEXT TO HIM, UH...

81
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,100
IT WASN'T ALWAYS THAT WAY
EITHER.
NO?

82
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,000
YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH?

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,600
THERE WAS A TIME WHERE HE
ULDN'T EVEN DESIGN A PUP TENT.

84
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
HELL, 10 YEARS AGO,
HE WAS WORKING AS A BARTENDER

85
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,100
AT TS PLACE CALLED LLOYD'S,
A COMPLETE DIVE.

86
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
SO, WHAT CHANGED?
YOU GOT ME.

87
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,300
BUT OVERNIGHT HE GETS
THIS HUGE COMMISSION,

88
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,000
AND HE STARTS DESIGNING --

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
HE STARTS DESIGNING
THE MOST INGENIOUS BUILDINGS

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,300
ANYONE HAS EVER SEEN.

91
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,900

OF VAN GOGH AND MOZART.

WHAT?

DON'T THEY?

95
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,900
TO HAVE THAT KIND OF TALENT,

96
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,200
WHY...
WHY JUST THROW IT AWAY?

97
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
SO?

98
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,300

YOU DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ASK HER

102
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,200
IF SHE'S SEEN ANY BLACK DOGS,
DID YOU?

103
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,600
EVERY COMPLAINT CALLED IN

104
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,300
ABOUT ANYTHING BIG, BLACK,
OR DOGLIKE.

105

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,400
AND, UH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THIS IS.

107
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,700
YOU MEAN,
CARLY'S MySpace ADDRESS?

108
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,200
YEAH, MySpace --
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

109
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,100
SERIOUSLY, IS THAT LIKE
SOME SORT OF PORN SITE?

110
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
I SWEAR, IF THIS IS
ANOTHER FREAKIN' POMERANIAN

111

OH, WE'RE JUST FOLLOWING UP.

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,900
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR DR. SYLVIA PERLMAN.

117
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
THE DOCTOR, WELL, SHE --

118
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,500
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHEN SHE'LL BE BACK.
SHE LEFT TWO DAYS AGO.

119
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,300
OKAY.
AND YOU ARE?

120
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,500

00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,900
SO, WHERE DID THE DOCTOR GO?

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,100
I'M NOT SURE.

123
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,500
SHE JUST PACKED AND WENT.
SHE DIDN'T SAY WHERE.

124
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,200
THAT STRAY DOG,
DID YOU FIND IT FINALLY?

125
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,600
UH, NOT YET.

126
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,700
YOU DIDN'T EVER HAPPEN TO SEE
THE DOG YOURSELF, DID YOU?

127
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,500
WELL, NO.
I NEVER EVEN HEARD IT.

128
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,200
I WAS ALMOST STARTING TO THINK
THE DOCTOR WAS IMAGINING THINGS,

129
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,800
BUT SHE'S NOT LIKE THAT,
SO...

130
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,900
YOU KNOW, I READ SHE WAS THE
CHIEF SURGEON AT THE HOSPITAL.

131
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,000
SO SHE'S GOT TO BE,
WHAT, 42, 43?

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,300
THAT'S PRETTY YOUNG
FOR THAT JOB.

133
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,000
YOUNGEST IN THE HISTORY
OF THE PLACE.

134

SHE GOT THE POSITION
10 YEARS AGO.

135
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,000
AN OVERNIGHT SUCCESS,
10 YEARS AGO.

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,300
YEAH, WE KNOW A GUY LIKE THAT.

137
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,900

139
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,200
MISS PERLMAN?

140
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,000
I'VE BEEN CALLING FOR HOURS!

141
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,900
YOU NEED TO VACATE THE ROOM,
OR YOU GOT TO PAY FOR THE NIGHT!

142
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,900
OKAY, NO PROBLEM.

143
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,300
HEY.

144
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
YEAH?

145
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,000
THAT'S WEIRD.

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,100
WHAT?
THINK SOMEONE PLANTED THESE?

147
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,500
IN THE MIDDLE
OF ALL THESE WEEDS?

148
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,300

YEAH.

150

USED FOR CERTAIN RITUALS,
AREN'T THEY?

151
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,100
YEAH, ACTUALLY,
SUMMONING RITUALS.

152
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,900
SO, TWO PEOPLE BECOME SUDDEN
SUCCESSES ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO,

153
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,200
RIGHT AROUND THE TIME THEY WERE
HANGING OUT HERE AT LLOYD'S.

154
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,100
WHERE THERE JUST HAPPENS TO BE
A CROSSROADS.

155
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,500
YOU THINK?
LET'S FIND OUT.

156
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,000
SEEM ABOUT THE DEAD CENTER
TO YOU?

157
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,700
YAHTZEE.

158
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,000
I'D BE WILLING TO BET
THAT'S GRAVEYARD DIRT.

159
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,700
AND A BLACK CAT BONE.

160
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,500
THAT'S SERIOUS SPELLWORK.

161
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,400
I MEAN, THAT'S DEEP SOUTH
HOODOO STUFF.

162
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,100
USED TO SUMMON A DEMON.

163
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,800
NOT JUST SUMMON ONE.

164
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,900
CROSSROADS
ARE WHERE PACTS ARE MADE.

165
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,700
THESE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY MAKING
DEALS WITH THE DAMNED THING.

166
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,500
[ Sarcastically ] YOU KNOW,
'CAUSE THAT ALWAYS ENDS GOOD.

167
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,800
THEY'RE SEEING DOGS,
ALL RIGHT...

168
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,200
BUT NOT BLACK DOGS.

169
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,500
THEY'RE SEEING HELLHOUNDS --
DEMONIC PIT BULLS.

170
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,600
WHOEVER THIS DEMON IS,
IT'S BACK AND IT'S COLLECTING.

171
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,000
AND THAT DOCTOR LADY,
WHEREVER SHE'S RUNNING,

172
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,600
SHE AIN'T RUNNING
FAST ENOUGH.

173
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
HOLY...

174
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,600
HOLY?

175
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,800
I WANT TO PLAY GUITAR.

176
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,900
I WANT TO BE
THE BEST IN THE WORLD.

177
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,200
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

178
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,900
SO...HOW DO WE --
DO WE SHAKE ON IT?

179
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,400
Sam: SO, IT'S JUST LIKE THE
ROBERT JOHNSON LEGEND, RIGHT?

180
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,900
I MEAN, "SELLING YOUR SOUL AT
THE CROSSROADS" KIND OF DEAL?

181
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,700
EXCEPT THAT WASN'T A LEGEND.
YOU KNOW HIS MUSIC.

182
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,200
YOU DON'T KNOW
ROBERT JOHNSON SONGS?

183
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,300
SAM, THERE'S OCCULT REFERENCES
ALL OVER HIS LYRICS.

184
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,200
I MEAN, "CROSS ROAD BLUES,"
"ME AND THE DEVIL BLUES,"

185
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,100
"HELLHOUND ON MY TRAIL"?

186
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,300
STORY GOES THAT HE DIED
CHOKING ON HIS OWN BLOOD.

187
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,100
HE WAS HALLUCINATING AND
MUTTERING ABOUT BIG, EVIL DOGS.

188
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,300
AND NOW IT'S HAPPENING
ALL OVER AGAIN.
YEAH.

189
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,500
WE GOT TO FIND OUT IF ANYONE
ELSE STRUCK ANY BARGAINS.

190
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,600
RIGHT, SO, WE GOT TO CLEAN UP
THESE PEOPLE'S MESS FOR THEM?

191
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,400
THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY
SQUEAKY-CLEAN.

192
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,000
NOBODY PUT A GUN
TO THEIR HEAD

193
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,300
AND FORCED THEM TO PLAY
"LET'S MAKE A DEAL."

194
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,300
SO, WHAT, WE SHOULD
JUST LEAVE THEM TO DIE?

195
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,700
SOMEBODY GOES OVER NIAGARA
IN A BARREL,

196
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,800
YOU GONNA JUMP IN
TO TRY TO SAVE THEM?

197
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,300
DEAN...

198
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,100
ALL RIGHT...FINE.

199
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,700
RITUALS LIKE THIS,

200
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,400
YOU GOT TO PUT YOUR OWN PHOTO
INTO THE MIX, RIGHT?

201
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,700
SO THIS GUY
PROBABLY SUMMONED THE THING.

202
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,700
LET'S SEE IF ANYONE INSIDE
KNOWS HIM...

203
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,500
IF HE'S STILL ALIVE.

204
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,900
WHAT'S THIS GUY'S NAME,
AGAIN?

205
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
GEORGE DARROW.

206
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,900
APPARENT QUITE THE REGULAR
AT LLOYD'S.

207
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,800
THIS HOUSE PROBABLY AIN'T UP
NEXT ON "MTV CRIBS," IS IT?

208
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,700
[ Chuckling ] YEAH.

209
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,200
SO, WHATEVER KIND OF DEAL
HE MADE...

210
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,300
WASN'T FOR CASH.
AH, WHO KNOWS?

211
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,800
MAYBE HIS PLACE IS FULL OF BABES
IN PRINCESS LEIA BIKINIS.

212
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,300
I'M JUST SAYING, THIS GUY'S GOT
ONE EPIC BILL COME DUE.

213
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,600
HOPE AT LEAST HE ASKED
FOR SOMETHING FUN.

214
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,700
LOOK AT THAT.

215
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,900
WHAT IS THAT, PEPPER?

216
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,200
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

217
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,600
GEORGE DARROW?

218
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,000
I'M NOT BUYING ANYTHING.

219
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,600
WHOA, LOOKS LIKEOU WENT
FOR THE WRONG SHAKER, THERE.

220
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,000
USUALLY, WHEN YOU WANT TO KEEP
SOMETHING EVIL OUT,

221
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,800
YOU GO FOR THE SALT.

222
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,000
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

223
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,700
TALKING ABOUT THIS.

224
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,300
TELL ME...

225
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,200
YOU SEEN THAT HELLHOUND YET?

226
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,500
LOOK, WE WANT TO HELP.

227
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,100
PLEASE, JUST 5 MINUTES.

228
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,300
SO, WHAT IS THAT STUFF
OUT FRONT?

229
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,800
GOOFER DUST.

230
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,800
WHAT, YOU BOYS THINK YOU KNOW
SOMETHING ABOUT SOMETHING,

231
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,100
BUT NOT GOOFER DUST?

232
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,600
WELL, WE KNOW A LITTLE
ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS,

233
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,500
JUST ENOUGH
TO MAKE US DANGEROUS.

234
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,500
WHAT IS IT?

235
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,300
HOODOO.

236
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
MY GRANDMA TAUGHT ME.

237
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,200
KEEPS OUT DEMONS.

238
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,000
DEMONS, WE KNOW.

239
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,200
WELL, THEN, KEEP IT.

240
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,500
MAYBE IT'LL DO YOU
SOME GOOD.

241
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,600
4 MINUTES LEFT.

242
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,200
MR. DARROW...
WE KNOW YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.

243
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,100
YEAH, THAT YOU GOT YOURSELF
INTO.

244
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,700
BUT IT'S NOT HOPELESS,
ALL RIGHT?

245
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,600
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING
WE CAN DO.

246
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,800
LISTEN, I GET THAT YOU BOYS
WANT TO HELP,

247
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,300
BUT SOMETIMES A PERSON
MAKES THEIR BED

248
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,900
AND THEY JUST GOT TO LIE DOWN
IN IT.

249
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,700
I'M THE ONE CALLED THAT DEMON
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

250
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,300
WHAT'D YOU DO IT FOR?

251
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,800
I WAS WEAK.

252
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I MEAN,
WHO DON'T WANT TO BE GREAT?

253
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,700
WHO DON'T WANT THEIR LIFE
TO MEAN SOMETHING?

254
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,300
I JUST... [SIGHS]

255
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,500
I JUST NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT THE PRICE.

256
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,700
WAS IT WORTH IT?

257
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,600
HELL, NO.

258
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,900
COURSE, I ASKED FOR TALENT.

259
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,100
SHOULD HAVE GONE FOR FAME.

260
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,900
I'M STILL BROKE...AND LONELY.

261
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,100
JUST NOW I GOT THIS PILE OF
PAINTINGS DON'T NOBODY WANT.

262
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,000
THAT WASN'T THE WORST.

263
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,900
GO ON.

264
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,800
DEMON DIDN'T LEAVE.

265
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
I NEVER COUNTED ON THAT.

266
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,000
AFTER OUR DEAL WAS DONE,

267
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,400
THE DAMN THING STAYED AT LLOYD'S
FOR A WEEK,

268
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,900
JUST CHATTING,
MAKING MORE DEALS.

269
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,900
I TRIED TO WARN FOLKS,

270
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,600
BUT WHO GONNA LISTEN
TO AN OLD DRUNK?

271
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,800
HOW MANY OTHERS ARE THERE?

272
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,300
UH, THIS ARCHITECT,
A DOCTOR LADY.

273
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,100
I KEPT UP WITH THEM.
THEY BEEN IN THE PAPERS.

274
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,700
[ SIGHS ]
AT LEAST THEY GOT FAMOUS.

275
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
WHO ELSE, GEORGE?
COME ON, THINK.

276
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,300
OH, ONE MORE.

277
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,000
UH, NICE GUY, TOO.

278
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,500
HUDSON -- EVANI THINK.

279
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,400
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE ASKED FOR.

280
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,700
DON'T MATTER NOW.
WE DONE FOR.

281
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,700
NO.
NO, THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY.

282
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,900
YOU DON'T GET IT.

283
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,600
I DON'T WANT A WAY.

284
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,300
LOOK, YOU DON'T --

285
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,300
LOOK, I CALLED THAT THING!

286
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,800
I BROUGHT IT ON MYSELF!

287
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,900
I BROUGHT IT ON THEM.

288
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,000
I'M GOING TO HELL,
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

289
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,300
ALL I WANT IS TO FINISH
MY LAST PAINTING.

290
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,900
DAY OR TWO, I'M DONE.

291
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,900
I'M JUST TRYING TO HOLD HIM OFF
TILL THEN,

292
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,300
BUY A LITTLE TIME.

293
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,200
OKAY, BOYS, TIME YOU WENT.

294
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,500
GO HELP SOMEBODY
THAT WANTS HELP.

295
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,000
WE CAN'T JUST --
GET OUT!

296
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,000
I GOT WORK TO DO.

297
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,200
YOU DON'T REALLY
WANT TO DIE.

298
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,200
I DON'T?

299
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,800
I'M TIRED.

300
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,100
EVAN?

301
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,900
ARE YOU SPYING
ON THE NEIGHBORS?

302
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,400
NO, I, UH, I THOUGHT I HEARD
SOMETHING IN THE YARD,

303
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,600
BUT IT'S NOTHING.

304
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,200
YOU ALL READY TO GO?

305
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,500
YOU KNOW,
IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,

306
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,200
I'D SAY THAT YOU WANT ME
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

307
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,800
OF COURSE NOT.

308
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,100
IT'S JUST, YOU'VE --

309
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,800
YOU'VE BARELY SEEN YOUR SISTER
SINCE SHE HAD THE BABY.

310
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,100
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
ALL WEEKEND?

311
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,500
UM, NOT MUCH.

312
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,600
I GOT SOME BILLS TO PAY.

313
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,900
COME HERE.

314
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,000
I'LL MISS YOU.

315
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,300
YOU BETTER.

316
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,200
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU, RIGHT?

317
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,600
FOREVER.

318
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,600
OF COURSE.
EVAN, ARE YOU OKAY?

319
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,800
YEAH.

320
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,900
YEAH, I'M FINE.

321
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,200
NOW, GET GOING.

322
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,500
OKAY, I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN I GET THERE.

323
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,000
HEY, SWEETIE?

324
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,300
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

325
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
YES?

326
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,200
EVAN HUDSON?
YEAH.

327
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,100
YOU EVER BEEN TO A BAR
CALLED LLOYD'S?

328
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,900
WOULD HAVE BEEN
ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO.

329
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,700
COME ON, WE'RE NOT DEMONS.

330
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,400
ANY OTHER BRIGHT IDEAS?

331
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,000
EVAN?

332
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,100
PLEASE!
DON'T HURT ME.

333
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,600
WE'RE NOT GONNA HURT YOU,
ALL RIGHT?

334
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,400
WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU.

335
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,600
WE KNOW ALL ABOUT
THE GENIUS DEAL YOU MADE.

336
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,900
WHAT? HOW?

337
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,400
DOESN'T MATTER.

338
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,900
ALL THAT MATTERS IS
WE'RE TRYING TO STOP IT.

339
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,100
HOW DO I KNOW YOU'RE NOT LYING?

340
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,600
WELL, YOU DON'T,

341
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,500
BUT YOU'RE KIND OF RUNNING LOW
ON OPTIONS, THERE, BUDDY BOY.

342
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,800
C-CAN YOU STOP IT?

343
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,700
DON'T KNOW.
WE'LL TRY.

344
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,900
I DON'T WANT TO DIE.

345
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,600
OF COURSE YOU DON'T.
NOT NOW.

346
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
DEAN, STOP.

347
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,900
WHAT'D YOU ASK FOR,
ANYWAY, EV, HUH?

348
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,800
NEVER NEED VIAGRA,
BOWL A PERFECT GAME, WHAT?

349
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,000
MY WIFE.

350
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,900
RIGHT, GETTING THE GIRL.
THAT'S WORTH A TRIP TO HELL FOR.

351
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
DEAN, STOP.

352
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,400
NO. HE'S RIGHT.
I MADE THE DEAL.

353
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,700
NOBODY TWISTED MY ARM.

354
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,600
THAT, UH, WOMAN,

355
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,400
OR WHATEVER SHE WAS,
AT THE BAR,

356
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,200
SHE SAID I COULD HAVE
ANYTHING I WANTED.

357
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,200
I THOUGHT SHE WAS NUTS,
AT FIRST, BUT...

358
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,000
I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS -- I WAS DESPERATE.

359
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,300
DESPERATE?

360
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,100
JULIE WAS DYING.

361
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,300
YOU DID IT TO SAVE HER?

362
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,000
SHE HAD CANCER.
THEY HAD STOPPED TREATMENT.

363
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,400
THEY WERE MOVING HER
INTO HOSPICE.

364
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,400
THEY KEPT SAYING,
"MATTER OF DAYS."

365
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,600
SO, YEAH, I MADE THE DEAL...
AND I'D DO IT AGAIN.

366
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,400
I'D HAVE DIED FOR HER
ON THE SPOT.

367
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,600
DID YOU EVER THINK ABOUT HER
IN ALL THIS?

368
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,000
I DID THIS FOR HER.

369
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,600
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

370
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,300
I THINK YOU DID IT
FOR YOURSELF...

371
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,300
SO YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO LIVE
WITHOUT HER.

372
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,600
BUT, GUESS WHAT, SHE'S GONNA
HAVE TO LIVE WITHOUT <i>YOU</i> NOW.

373
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,300
WHAT IF SHE KNEW
HOW MUCH IT COST?

374
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,800
WHAT IF SHE KNEW
IT COST YOUR SOUL?

375
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,300
HOW DO YOU THINK SHE'D FEEL?

376
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,800
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

377
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,100
EVAN, SIT TIGHT, ALL RIGHT?
WE'RE GONNA FIGURE THIS OUT.

378
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,500
YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHY WOULDN'T I BE?

379
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,300
HEY, I GOT AN IDEA.

380
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,100
YOU THROW GEORGE'S HOODOO
AT THAT HELLHOUND,

381
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,900
KEEP IT AWAY FROM EVAN
AS LONG AS YOU CAN.

382
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
I'M GONNA GO TO THE CROSSROADS
AND SUMMON THE DEMON.

383
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,100
SUMMON -- ARE YOU NUTS?

384
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,300
MAYBE A LITTLE.

385
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,600
BUT I CAN TRAP IT.

386
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
I CAN EXORCISE IT,

387
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,400
AND I CAN BUY US TIME TO FIGURE
OUT SOMETHING MORE PERMANENT.

388
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,600
YEAH, BUT HOW MUCH TIME?
I DON'T KNOW. AWHILE.

389
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,000
IT'S NOT EASY FOR THOSE SUCKERS

390
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,900
TO CLAW THEIR WAY BACK FROM HELL
AND INTO THE SUNSHINE.

391
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,700
NO. NO WAY.

392
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,600
NOT ALLOWED TO SAY NO, SAMMY,
UNLESS YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA.

393
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,000
DEAN, YOU CAN FORGET IT,
ALL RIGHT?

394
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,500
I'M NOT LETTING YOU SUMMON
THAT DEMON

395
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,800
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE WHERE
YOUR HEAD IS AT RIGHT NOW.

396
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,100
????

397
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,600
YOU'VE BEEN ON EDGE EVER SINCE
WE FOUND THAT CROSSROADS, DEAN,

398
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
AND I THINK I KNOW WHY.

399
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,700
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THIS.

400
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,300
DAD.

401
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,600
YOU THINK MAYBE DAD MADE
ONE OF THESE DEALS, HUH?

402
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,800
HELL, I'VE BEEN THINKING IT.

403
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,900
I'M SURE YOU'VE BEEN
THINKING IT, TOO.

404
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,900
IT FITS, DOESN'T IT?

405
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,500
I'M ALIVE, DAD'S DEAD.
YELLOW-EYED DEMON WAS INVOLVED.

406
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,200
WHAT IF HE DID?

407
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,900
WHAT IF HE STRUCK A DEAL?

408
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,600
MY LIFE FOR HIS SOUL.

409
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,400
Evan: HEY, GUYS, I THINK
I HEAR IT! IT'S OUTSIDE!

410
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,000
JUST KEEP HIM ALIVE, OKAY?

411
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,800
DEAN?

412
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
GO!

413
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,700
SO, WHAT BRINGS A GUY LIKE YOU
TO A PLACE LIKE THIS?

414
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,000
YOU CALLED ME?

415
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,200
I'M JUST GLAD IT WORKED.

416
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,800
FIRST TIME?

417
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,700
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

418
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,400
OH, COME ON, NOW.

419
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
DON'T SELL YOURSELF SHORT.

420
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,100
I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU,
DEAN WINCHESTER.

421
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,200
SO YOU KNOW WHO I AM.

422
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,000
I GET THE NEWSLETTER.

423
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,100
WELL,
DON'T KEEP ME IN SUSPENSE.

424
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,000
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD?

425
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,600
WELL,
I HEARD YOU WERE HANDSOME.

426
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,200
YOU'RE JUST EDIBLE.

427
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,400
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, DEAN?

428
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,100
MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THIS
IN MY CAR.

429
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,800
NICE AND PRIVATE.

430
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,000
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

431
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,100
WHAT IS THAT STUFF?

432
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,400
GOOFER DUST.

433
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,500
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

434
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,300
YEAH. AFRAID SO.

435
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,300
LOOK, BELIEVE ME,
DON'T BELIEVE ME --
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

436
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,500
JUST WHATEVER YOU DO, STAY
INSIDE THIS CIRCLE, ALL RIGHT?

437
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,300
SO, I WAS HOPING
WE COULD STRIKE A DEAL.

438
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,500
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

439
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,800
I WANT EVAN HUDSON RELEASED
FROM HIS CONTRACT.

440
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,500
SO SORRY, DARLING.
THAT'S NOT NEGOTIABLE.

441
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
I'LL MAKE IT
WORTH YOUR WHILE.

442
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,000
OH, REALLY?

443
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,300
WHAT ARE YOU OFFERING?

444
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,500
ME.

445
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,800
WELL, WELL, WELL.

446
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,700
YOU'D SACRIFICE YOUR LIFE
FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S.

447
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,300
LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON.

448
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,300
THAT'S THE LAST OF IT.

449
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,300
YOU DID KNOW
ABOUT YOUR DAD'S DEAL, RIGHT?

450
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,900
HIS LIFE FOR YOURS.

451
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,800
OH, I DIDN'T MAKE THE DEAL
MYSELF,

452
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,400
BUT, BOY, I WISH I HAD.

453
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,700
AFTER YOU.

454
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,900
SUCH A GENTLEMAN.

455
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,500
A DEVIL'S TRAP?

456
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

457
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,200
[ GROWLING ]
WHAT?

458
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,400
YOU HEAR THAT?

459
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,900
NO. WHERE?

460
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,200
RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR.

461
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,600
JUST DON'T MOVE, ALL RIGHT?

462
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,000
STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

463
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,200
YOU STUPID, STUPID...

464
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,400
I SHOULD RIP YOU
LIMB FROM LIMB.

465
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,800
TAKE YOUR BEST SHOT.

466
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,000
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

467
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,900
I'M NOT GONNA PUT YOU
OUT OF YOUR MISERY.

468
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,900
YEAH? WHY NOT?

469
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,800
'CAUSE YOUR MISERY
IS THE WHOLE POINT.

470
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,400
IT'S TOO MUCH FUN TO WATCH.

471
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,200
KNOWING HOW YOUR DADDY DIED
FOR YOU,

472
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,100
HOW HE SOLD HIS SOUL.

473
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,600
I MEAN, THAT'S GOT TO HURT.

474
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
HE'S ALL YOU EVER THINK ABOUT.

475
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,600
YOU WAKE UP,
AND YOUR FIRST THOUGHT IS

476
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,000
"I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE."

477
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,400
YOU'RE ALL LIT UP WITH PAIN.

478
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,200
I MEAN,
YOU LOVED HIM SO MUCH.

479
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,200
AND IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.

480
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,800
YOU BLEW IT, DEAN.

481
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,600
I COULD HAVE GIVEN YOU
WHAT YOU NEED.

482
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,000
WHAT DO I NEED?

483
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,400
YOUR FATHER.

484
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
I COULD HAVE BROUGHT HIM BACK.

485
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,900
YOUR LOSS.

486
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,700
SEE YA, DEAN.

487
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,300
I WISH YOU A NICE, LONG LIFE.

488
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,200
HOLD ON.

489
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,600
DO YOU STILL HEAR IT?
NO.

490
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,700
IS IT OVER?

491
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,700
IT'S HERE!

492
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,900
YOU'RE LUCKY I'VE GOT
A SOFT SPOT

493
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,500
FOR LOST PUPPIES
AND LONG FACES.

494
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,100
I JUST CAN'T LEAVE YOU
LIKE THIS.

495
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,000
BESIDES, YOU DIDN'T CALL ME HERE
TO BARGAIN FOR EVAN.

496
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,900
NOT REALLY.

497
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,300
CAN YOU BRING HIM BACK,
MY DAD?

498
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,000
OF COURSE I CAN,
JUST AS HE WAS.

499
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,100
YOUR DAD WOULD LIVE
A LONG, NATURAL LIFE,

500
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,000
LIKE HE WAS MEANT TO.

501
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,100
THAT'S A PROMISE.

502
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,200
WHAT ABOUT ME?

503
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,900
I COULD GIVE YOU 10 YEARS,

504
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,800
10 LONG, GOOD YEARS WITH HIM.

505
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,400
THAT'S A LIFETIME.

506
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,900
THE FAMILY COULD BE TOGETHER
AGAIN --

507
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,300
JOHN, DEAN, SAMMY.

508
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,400
THE WINCHESTER BOYS
ALL REUNITED.

509
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,300
LOOK, YOUR DAD
IS SUPPOSED TO BE ALIVE.

510
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,400
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD.

511
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
SO, WE'LL JUST SET THINGS
STRAIGHT,

512
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,700
PUT THINGS
BACK IN THEIR NATURAL ORDER,

513
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,400
AND YOU GET 10 EXTRA YEARS
ON TOP.

514
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,100
THAT'S A BONUS.

515
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,300
YOU THINK YOU COULD...

516
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,500
THROW IN A SET
OF STEAK KNIVES?

517
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,500
YOU KNOW, THIS SMARTASS
SELF-DEFENSE MECHANISM
OF YOURS...

518
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,200
DEAN...

519
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,600
NOW YOU'RE REALLY TRAPPED.

520
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,100
THAT'S GOT TO HURT.

521
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,800
LET ME OUT NOW.

522
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,000
SURE.

523
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,400
WE JUST GOT TO MAKE
A LITTLE DEAL HERE FIRST.

524
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,300
YOU CALL OFF YOUR HELLHOUND
AND LET EVAN GO.

525
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,400
THEN I'LL LET YOU GO.

526
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,000
I CAN'T BREAK
A BINDING CONTRACT.

527
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,400
AND BY "CAN'T,"
YOU MEAN "DON'T WANT TO"?

528
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,900
LAST CHANCE.

529
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,100
EVAN AND HIS WIFE GET TO LIVE
TO A RIPE OLD AGE.

530
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,900
GOING...GOING...

531
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,700
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.
OKAY, GONE.

532
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,900
Evan: CAN'T YOU SEE IT?
NO.STAY INSIDE THE CIRCLE!

533
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,600
COME ON, DEAN.

534
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,400
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

535
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,100
OH, YOU'RE JUST GONNA GO
ON A LITTLE TRIP.

536
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,900
WAY DOWN SOUTH.

537
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,400
LOOK, FORGET EVAN.
THINK OF YOUR DAD.

538
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,800
 <i>REGNA TERRAE, CANTATE DEO,</i>
 <i>PSALLITE DOMINO.</i>

 <i>VOCEM VIRTUTIS.</i>

544
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,600
CIRCLE'S BROKEN! COME ON!

545
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,600
 <i>REGNA TERRAE, CANTATE DEO,</i>
 <i>PSALLITE DOMINO.</i>

546

547
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,700

548
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,700
 <i>VADE, SATANA,</i>

552
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,900
RELEASE!

553
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,800
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT FOR?

554
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,300
SEALING THE DEAL.

555
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,900
I USUALLY LIKE TO BE WARNED

556
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,900
BEFORE I'M VIOLATED
WITH DEMON TONGUE.

557
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,800
EVAN HUDSON IS FREE.

558
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,600
HE AND HIS WIFE
WILL LIVE LONG LIVES.

559
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,100
HOW DO I KNOW
YOU'RE NOT LYING?

560
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,400
MY WORD IS MY BOND.

561
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,000
OH, REALLY?
IT IS WHEN I MAKE A DEAL.

562
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,200
IT'S THE RULES.

563
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,700
YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED.

564
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,300
NOW LET ME GO.

565
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,200
YOU'RE GONNA DOUBLE-CROSS ME?

566
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,600
FUNNY HOW
I'M THE TRUSTWORTHY ONE.

567
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,200
YOU KNOW, YOU RENEGE,
SEND ME TO HELL,

568
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,100
SOONER OR LATER
I'M GONNA CLIMB OUT,

569
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:36,300
AND SKINNING EVAN HUDSON WILL BE
THE FIRST THING THAT I DO.

570
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,100
I GOT TO TELL YOU,

571
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,000
KNEW WHAT?

572
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,800
WHERE YOUR DAD IS.

573
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,800
YOU SHOULD HAVE MADE
THAT DEAL.

574
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,900
SEE, PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HELL,
BUT IT'S JUST A WORD.

575
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,700
DOESN'T EVEN COME CLOSE
TO DESCRIBING THE REAL --

576
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,700
SHUT YOUR MOUTH, BITCH.

577
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,100
IF YOU COULD SEE
YOUR POOR DADDY,

578
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,800
HEAR THE SOUNDS HE MAKES
'CAUSE HE CAN'T EVEN SCREAM.

579
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,000
HOW ABOUT I SEND YOU
BACK THERE?

580
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,600
WHAT?

581
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,400
HOW DID I GET HERE?

582
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,500
DEMONS LIE ALL THE TIME,
RIGHT?

583
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,700
MAYBE SHE WAS LYING.

584
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,300
COME ON.
IS THAT REALLY WHAT YOU THINK?

585
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,600
HOW COULD HE DO IT?

586
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,200
HE DID IT FOR YOU.

587
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,400
EXACTLY.

588
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,900
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO LIVE
WITH THAT?

589
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,700
YOU KNOW,
THE THOUGHT OF HIM,

590
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,600
WHEREVER HE IS RIGHT NOW...

591
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,800
I MEAN,
HE SPENT HIS WHOLE LIFE

592
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,300
CHASING THAT YELLOW-EYED
SON OF A BITCH.

593
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,500
HE SHOULD HAVE GONE OUT
FIGHTING.

594
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,500
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
HIS LEGACY, YOU KNOW?

595
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,900
NOT BARGAINING
WITH THE DAMN THING.

596
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,700
NOT THIS.

597
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,000
HOW MANY PEOPLE
DO YOU THINK DAD SAVED TOTAL?

598
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,700
THAT'S NOT THE POINT, SAM.

599
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:34,300
EVAN HUDSON IS SAFE
BECAUSE OF WHAT DAD TAUGHT US.

600
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,200
THAT'S HIS LEGACY, DEAN.

601
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,600
NOW, WE'RE STILL HERE, MAN,
SO WE GOT TO KEEP GOING.

602
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,300
FOR HIM.

603
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,100
DEAN?
YEAH?

604
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,200
WHEN YOU WERE TRAPPING THAT
DEMON, YOU WEREN'T...

605
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,100
I MEAN, IT WAS ALL A TRICK,
RIGHT?

606
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,500
YOU NEVER CONSIDERED ACTUALLY
MAKING THAT DEAL, RIGHT?

607
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,300
I SWEAR IT'S NOT IN ME.
IT'S NOT IN ME, I SWEAR.

608
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,800
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE.

609
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,700
WE GOT NO CHOICE.
STOP!

610
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,400
NOW, DEAN, THEY SAY YOU CAN'T
PROTECT YOUR LOVED ONES FOREVER.

611
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,100
HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE 'EM!

612
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,500
Dean: A DEMONIC VIRUS?
Sam: YEAH, MORE LIKE
DEMONIC GERM WARFARE.

613
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,400
I FEEL LIKE CHUCK HESTON
IN "THE OMEGA MAN."

614
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,300
THEY'RE INFECTED,
NOT ME!

615
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,900
YOU'VE KNOWN ME ALL YOUR LIFE!

616
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,100
LET'S JUST GO.

617
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,300
WE CAN'T, 'CAUSE
THOSE THINGS ARE EVERYWHERE.

618
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,700
Man: SHE BLED ON HIM.

619
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,000
HE'S GOT THE VIRUS.

620
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,600
Sam:
I NEED A NATIONWIDE SEARCH.

621
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,600
WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR?

622
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,400
PSYCHICS, LIKE ME --
AS MANY AS POSSIBLE.

623
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,400
THE YELLOW-EYED MAN...
COMES TO ME IN MY DREAMS

624
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,500
AND TELLS ME TO DO THINGS,
AWFUL THINGS.

625
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,700
I HAD THIS ONE DREAM

626
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,600
WHERE I SAW THIS GUY GET STABBED
IN A PARKING LOT.

627
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,700
HE HAS PLANS FOR ME.

628
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
WHAT KIND OF PLANS?

629
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,700
LAST NIGHT I SAW YOU DIE.

630
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,700
RIGHT BEFORE DAD DIED,
HE TOLD ME SOMETHING.

631
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,000
HE TOLD ME SOMETHING
ABOUT YOU.

632
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,200
DEAN, WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?

633
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:54,500
