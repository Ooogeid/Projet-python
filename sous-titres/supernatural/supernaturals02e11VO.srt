1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,420
Dad wants us to pick upwhere he left off
-- saving people,hunting things,the family business.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,080
Then

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,840
Before dad died,he told me something about you.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,690
What's he tell you?

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,330
He said that I mighthave to kill you,sam.

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,340
What the hell is thatsupposed to mean? I don't know.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,760
Did he knowthe demon's plans for me?
Am I supposed to godark side or something?

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,790
- Who are you? - Please.

9
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,250
You're in danger.

10
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,860
- What's your name? - Ava wilson.

11
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,080
- You must be one of us. - One of who?

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,100
One of the psychicslike me.

13
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,580
There are otherslike us out there,
and we're alla part of something.

14
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,170
I'm not part of anything,okay? Do you see this?

15
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,520
I am getting marriedin eight weeks.

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,690
You can't run from this,and you can't protect me.

17
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,400
I can try.

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,360
Maybe I can help.

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,630
You've done all you can.

20
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,470
Just go back to your fianc?
You'll be safe there.

21
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,520
Promise meyou'll call,then.

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,900
I promise.

23
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,300
Ava.

24
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,270
NOW

25
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,770
Most of the stuffis up here.

26
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,910
Still can't believeyou're closing this house.

27
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,010
My parentsgot engaged here.

28
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,840
My grandparents,too.

29
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,800
Yeah,a lot of people did.

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,480
Boxes are at the endof the hall. Need any help?

31
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,080
No,ma'am. I got it.

32
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,840
He's gonnatake our toys?

33
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,220
Only the ones you don'tplay with anymore.

34
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,790
It's not like you don't haveenough already.

35
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,790
- Son of a bitch. - Son of a bitch.

36
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,160
Watch your mouth.

37
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,680
Maggie said it first.

38
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,670
Watch your mouth,too,maggie.

39
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,190
Good night,tabitha.

40
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,170
XXXX Please send someone now.

41
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,000
A man fell down my stairs,and I don't know
-- his head is,like,completely turned around.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,540
Oh,my god.

43
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,820

00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,130

53
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,760
Okay. Thanks,ellen.

54
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,990
- What did she have to say? - She got nothing.

55
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,030
I've been checking every database I can think of,federal,state,and local.

56
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,570
No one's heard anything about ava. She just --

57
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,530
into thin air,you know?

58
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,320
What about you?

59
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,940
No,same as before. Sorry,man.

60
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,240
Ellen did have one thing.

61
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,110
A hotel in cornwall,connecticut --

62
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,430
two freak accidents in the past three weeks.

63
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,290
Yeah,what's that have to do with ava?

64
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,490
It's a job. I mean,a lady drowned in the bathtub,

65
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,580
then a few days ago,a guy falls down the stairs,

66
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,000
head turns a complete 180,which isn't exactly normal,you know?

67
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,390
I don't know
-- it might be nothing,but I told ellen we'd think about checking it out.

68
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,220
- You did? - Yeah.

69
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,580
- You seem surprised. - Yeah,it's just,you know...

70
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,730
not the patented sam winchester way,is it?

71
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,630
What way is that?

72
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,080
Just figured after ava,there'd be,you know,

73
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,940
more angst and droopy music and staring out the rainy windows.

74
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,180
I'll shut up now.

75
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,500
Look,I'm the one who told her to go back home.

76
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,470
Now her fianc?s dead,

77
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,080
and some demon has taken her offto god knows where,you know?

78
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,400
We've been lookingfor a month now,and we got nothing.

79
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,670
So I'm notgiving up on her,but I'm not gonna letother people die,either.

80
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,650
We got to saveas many people as we can.

81
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,910
Wow,that attitudeis just way too healthy for me.

82
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,770
I'm officially uncomfortable now. Thank you.

83
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,760
All right,call ellen. Tell her we'll take it.

84
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,940
Dude,this is sweet.

85
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,700
I never get to workjobs like this.

86
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,240
Like what?

87
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,350
Old-school haunted houses. You know --

88
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:59,240
fog,secret passageways,sissy british accents.

89
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,560
Might even run into fred and daphne while we're inside.

90
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,860
Mmm,daphne -- love her.

91
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,960
Hey,wait a sec.

92
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,660
I'm not so surehaunted's the problem.

93
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,050
What do you mean?

94
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,400
You seethis pattern here?

95
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,670
That's a quincunx. It's a five-spot.

96
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,820
- Five-spot. - Yeah.

97
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,380
That's for hoodoo spellwork,isn't it?

98
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,140
You fill this thingwith bloodweed,you got a charmto ward off enemies.

99
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,200
Except I don't seeany bloodweed.

100
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,220
Don't you thinkthis place is a little too white-meat for hoodoo?

101
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,540
Maybe.

102
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,630
May I help you?

103
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,340
Hi. Yeah,I'd like a roomfor a couple of nights.

104
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,680
Hey!

105
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,730
- Sorry about that. - No problem.

106
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,150
Well,congratulations. You could besome of our final guests.

107
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,600
Well,soundsvaguely ominous.

108
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,490
No,I'm sorry. I mean,we're closingat the end of the month.

109
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,910
Let me guess -- you guys are here antiquing?

110
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,540
So,a king-size bed?

111
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,230
What? No.No,no.

112
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,050
We're -- two singles. We're just brothers.

113
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,680
Oh. Oh,I'm so sorry.

114
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,200
What did you meanthat we looked the type?

115
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:34,930
You know,speaking of antiques,you have a really interesting urn on the front porch.

116
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,950
- Where did you get that? - I have no idea. It's been there forever.

117
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,620
Here you go,Mr. Mahogoff.

118
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,680
Yo u'll be stayingin room 237.

119
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,000
Sherwin,could you show thesegentlemen to their rooms?

120
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,730
Let me guess --

121
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,560
antiquers?

122
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,930
- I can give you a handwith that bag. - I got it.

123
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,940
- So the hotel'sclosing up,huh? - Yep --

124
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,860
miss susantried to make a go of it,but the guests just don't comelike they used to.

125
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,920
Still,it's a damn shame.

126
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,230
It may not look it anymore,but this place was a palace.

127
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,330
Two different vice-presidents laid their headson our pillows.

128
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,010
My parents worked here. I practically grew up here.

129
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,260
I'm gonna miss it.

130
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,130
Here's your room.

131
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,400
Thanks.

132
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,420
You're not gonnacheap out on me,are you,boy?

133
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,230
What the...

134
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,900
what?

135
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,160
That's normal.

136
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,320
Why the hellwould anyone stay here? I'm amazed they keptin business this long.

137
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,610
All right,victim number one -- joan edison,43 years old,

138
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,280
a realtor handlingthe sale of the hotel.

139
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,850
And victim number twowas larry williams,moving some stuffout to goodwill.

140
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,060
They're both tied upin shutting the place down.

141
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,840
Yeah,Maybe someonedoesn't want to leave,and they're using hoodooto fight back.

142
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,830
Who do you thinkour witch doctor is -- susan?

143
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,910
Doesn't seem likely. She's the one selling.

144
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,900
So,what,then,sherwin?

145
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,570
I don't know.

146
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,440
Of course,the most troubling question is,why do these peopleassume we're gay?

147
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,480
You are kind of butch.

148
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,810
Probably thinkyou're over compensating.

149
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,470
Right.

150
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,280
Hey.

151
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,460
Look at that -- more hoodoo.

152
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,570
- Hi,there. - Hi.

153
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,950
Everything okaywith your room?

154
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,370
- Yeah,yeah. - Yeah,yeah.

155
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,120
- Yeah,everything's great. - Good.

156
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,970
Well,I was justin the middle of packing.

157
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,620
Hey,are thoseantique dolls?

158
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:32,420
'Cause this one here,he's got a major doll collection back home.Don't you? Huh?

159
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,640
- Big time. - Big time.

160
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,110
You think we could come inand take a look?

161
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,890
- I don't know. - Please? He loves them.

162
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:47,190
He's notgonna tell you this,but he's always dressing them upin little outfits.

163
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,660
You'd make his day. She would.Huh?Huh?

164
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,520
It's true.

165
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,050
Okay. Come on in.

166
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,840
All right. All right.

167
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,120
Wow.

168
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,830
This is a lot of dolls.

169
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,080
They're nice,you know. They're not supercreepy at all.

170
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,680
I supposethey are a little creepy.

171
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,720
But they'vebeen in the family forever -- a lot of sentimental value.

172
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,160
What is this? The hotel?

173
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,540
Yeah,that's right. Exact replica,custom-built.

174
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,750
His headgot twisted around.

175
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,950
What happened to it?

176
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,650
Tyler,probably.

177
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,350
Mommy.

178
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,630
Maggie's being mean.

179
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,840
Tyler,tell her I saidto be nice,okay?

180
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,250
Hey,tyler. I see you broke your doll. You want me to fix it?

181
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,550
I didn't break it. I found it like that.

182
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,360
Oh.

183
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,960
- Well,maybe maggie did it. - No,neither of us did it.

184
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
Grandma would get madif we broke him.

185
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,150
- Tyler,she wouldn't get mad. - Grandma?

186
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,920
Grandma rose. These were all her toys.

187
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,990
Oh,really?

188
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,970
Where's grandma rose now?

189
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,870
Up in her room.

190
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,970
You know,I'd reallylove to talk to rose about her incredible doll --

191
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,310
no.

192
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,560
I mean,I'm afraidthat's impossible.

193
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,060
My mother's been very sick,and she's not takingany visitors.

194
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,020
What do you think?

195
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,100
Dolls,hoodoo,mysterious shut-in grandma?

196
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,610
Well,dolls are used in all kind of voodooand hoodoo,

197
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,680
like cursesand binding spells.

198
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,790
Yeah,maybe we foundour witch doctor.

199
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:46,350
I'll go see what I can dig upon granny. You get online,check old obits,freak accidents.

200
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,120
- See if she's whacked anybody before. - Right.

201
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,580
Don't go surfing porn. It's not the kindof whacking I mean.

202
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,100
I've been meaning to ask -- what sort of renovationsare you planning?

203
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,850
- They never told you? - Told me what?

204
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,250
Miss thompson,we plan on demolishing the hotel.

205
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,230
Oh. I see.

206
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,380
Excuse me.

207
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,360
What happened?

208
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,650
The maid went into turn down the sheets,and he was just hanging there.

209
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,080
That's awful. He was a guest?

210
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,600
He worked for the companythat bought the place.

211
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,980
- I don't understand. - What?

212
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,150
Had a lot of bad luck around here.

213
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,450
Look,if you'dlike to check out,I'll give youa full refund.

214
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:03,230
No,thanks. I don't scare that easy.

215
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,940
There's been another one. Some guy just hung himselfin his room.

216
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,600
Yeah. I saw.

217
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,920
We got figure this outand fast. What did you find outabout granny?

218
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,240
You're bossy.

219
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,980
What?

220
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,410
You're bossy.

221
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,070
You're short.

222
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,500
- Are you drunk? - Yeah.

223
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,660
So?

224
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,360
Stupid.

225
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,010
Dude,what are you thinking? We're working a case.

226
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,650
That guywho hung himself --

227
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,840
I couldn't save him.

228
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,620
What are you talking about? You couldn't have done anything.

229
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,740
That's an excuse,dean.

230
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,390
I should have founda way to save him.

231
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,890
I should havesaved ava,too.

232
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,220
Well,you can'tsave everyone. Even you said that.

233
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,510
No,dean,you don't understand,all right?

234
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,420
The more people I save,the more I can change.

235
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,740
- Change what? - My destiny,dean.

236
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,890
All right,time for bed. Come on,sasquatch.

237
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,350
- I need youto watch out for me. - Yeah,I always do.

238
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,340
No.No,no,no. You have to watch out for me...

239
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,990
all right?

240
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,470
And if I ever turn intosomething that I'm not...

241
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,230
- ...you have to kill me. - Sam...

242
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,000
dean,dad told you to do it. You have to.

243
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,620
Yeah,well,dad's an ass.

244
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,350
He never should havesaid anything. You don't lay that crapon your kids.

245
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,010
No,he was rightto say it.

246
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,450
Who knowswhat I might become?

247
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,010
Even now,everyone around me dies.

248
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,170
Well,I'm not dying,okay?

249
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,310
And neither are you. Come on,sit down.

250
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,190
No,please,dean,you're the only onewho can do it.

251
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,660
- promise me - Don't ask that of me.

252
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,160
Dean,please. You have to promise me.

253
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,800
I promise.

254
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,510
Thanks.

255
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,520
- Thank you. - Okay.

256
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,470
Find any good antiques?

257
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,690
No,no. Got distracted.

258
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,860
Have a drink.

259
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,800
Yeah,thanks.

260
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,070
So,poor guy,huh,killing himself?

261
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,380
That kind of thing seems to begoing around lately.

262
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,880
Yeah. Yeah,I heardabout the other ones.

263
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,480
It's almost like this hotelis cursed or something.

264
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,330
Every hotelhas its spilled blood.

265
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,600
If people only knewwhat's gone on in some of those roomsthey've checked into.

266
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,520
You know a lot about the place,don't you?

267
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,650
Down to the last nail.

268
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,360
I'd love to hearsome stories.

269
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:52,040
Boy,you should never say thatto an old man.

270
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:01,020
This is little miss susanand her mother,rose. Happier days.

271
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,780
They're not happy now?

272
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,230
I don't know. I never really knew one.

273
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:17,250
Well,this is rose's home. Been in the familyover a century.

274
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:22,820
Used to bethe family estate,and now she gets to livein some senior-living graveyard,

275
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,480
and they tearthis place down.

276
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,140
That's too bad.

277
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,410
- I hear roseisn't feeling well,either. - No,she isn'T.

278
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,870
What's wrong with her?

279
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,240
It's not my businessto say.

280
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,700
Who's this?

281
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,510
That's rosewhen she was a little girl.

282
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,070
Who's that with her?

283
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:02,120
That's her nanny,marie. She looked after rosemore than her own mother.

284
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,080
How you feeling,sammy?

285
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,980
I guessmixing whiskey and jager wasn't such a gangbuster idea,was it?

286
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,360
I'll bet you don't remembera thing from last night,do you?

287
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,880
No,I can still taste the tequila.

288
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,960
You know,there's a really goodhangover remedy.

289
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,390
It's a greasy pork sandwichserved up in a dirty ashtray.

290
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,060
- Oh,I hate you. - I know you do.

291
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,420
Hey,turns outwhen grandma rose was a tyke,

292
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,330
she had a creole nannywho wore a hoodoo necklace.Ugh.

293
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,240
- So you thinkshe taught rose hoodoo? - Yes,I do.

294
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,950
All right.

295
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,100
I think it's timewe talk to rose,then.

296
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,730
Oh,you needto brush your teeth first.

297
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,000
Hello?

298
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,460
Susan?

299
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,430
Clear?

300
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,150
Mrs. Thompson?

301
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,180
Mrs. Thompson?

302
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,550
Rose?

303
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:10,360
Hi,Mrs. Thompson. We're not here to hurt you. It's okay. We...

304
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,290
rose?

305
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,580
Dean.

306
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,790
This woman'shad a stroke.

307
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,290
Yeah,but hoodoo's hands-on. You got to mix herbs and chant,build an altar.

308
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,450
So it can't be rose.

309
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,960
- Heck,maybe it's not even hoodoo. - She could be faking.

310
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,500
What do you want to do,poke her with a stick?

311
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,430
Dude,you're not gonnapoke her with a stick.

312
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:46,240
What the hell? What are you doing in here?

313
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,110
We just wantedto talk to rose.

314
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,210
Look at her. She's scared out of her wits.

315
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:53,580
I want you out of my hotel,or I'm calling the cops.

316
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,850
Your turn. Eightsies.

317
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,880
Have youstarted packing yet?

318
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,450
- No. - Why not?

319
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,310
I don't want to move.

320
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,240
Yes,I know,but we have to.

321
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,990
But maggie sayswe're not allowed to move.

322
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,210
Yeah.

323
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,640
Tyler,enough. Maggie is imaginary.

324
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,330
You're too oldto have an imaginary friend,and I am done pretending.

325
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,900
I don't like her.

326
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,800
Okay,then. See you later.

327
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,490
- You okay? - I think so.

328
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,470
Come on. Come on. Let's get inside. Let's go.

329
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,270
- Whiskey. - Sure.

330
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,740
I know the feeling.

331
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,870
What the hellhappened out there?

332
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,040
- You want the truth? - Of course.

333
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,840
At first,we thoughtit was a hoodoo curse,but that out there --

334
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,590
that was definitely a spirit.

335
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,140
Here.

336
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,810
You're insane.

337
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,180
It's been said.

338
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,930
Look,I'm sorry,susan. We don't exactly have timeto ease you into this,

339
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:53,040
but we need to knowwhen your mother had the stroke.

340
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,660
- What does that have to do -- - just answerthe question.

341
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,210
About a month ago.

342
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,930
Right beforethe killings began. You see?

343
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:04,640
So what if rose was working hoodoo,but not to hurt anyone,to protect them?

344
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,930
She was using the urnsto ward off the spirit.

345
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,770
- Until she had a strokeand couldn't anymore. - I don't believe this.

346
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:13,060
Listen,that car didn't tryto run you down by itself,okay?

347
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:17,280
I mean,I guess it didtechnically,but with a spirit -- forget it.

348
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,490
Believe what you want,but youand your family are in danger.

349
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,740
So you need to clear everybodyout of here --

350
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,660
your employees,your mother,your daughters,everyone.

351
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,110
I only haveone daughter.

352
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,110
- One? - I thought tylerhad a sister named maggie.

353
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,470
Maggie's imaginary.

354
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,500
Where's tyler?

355
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,460
She's going to stay herewith me,and you can't stop me.

356
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,510
There's nothingyou can do about it.

357
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,760
Maggie,don'T. You're notsupposed to bother grandma.

358
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,060
I know.

359
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,200
Come on.

360
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,870
Let's play.

361
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,450
Can we have a tea party?

362
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,500
We can have lots of tea parties

363
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:18,310
forever,ever,until ever

364
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,260
Tyler!

365
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,330
Oh,my god! Tyler!

366
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,210
Tyler!

367
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,890
She's not here.

368
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,350
Susan,tell us what you knowabout maggie.

369
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,140
Tyler's been talking about hersince mom got sick.

370
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,200
Okay,did you ever knowanyone by that name?

371
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,730
Think,think -- somebodythat could have lived here,might have passed away.

372
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,410
My god -- my mom had a sisternamed margaret.

373
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:58,400
- She barely spoke about her. - Did margaret die herewhen she was a kid?

374
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,230
Yeah,she drownedin the pool.

375
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,280
Come on.

376
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:24,940
I don't like it up here. I'm scared.

377
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,310
It's okay. All you have to dois jump.

378
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,470
I can't swim.

379
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,990
I know.

380
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,440
But it won't hurt.

381
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,010
I promise.

382
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,690
And then we can be togetherforever,and no one will bother us.

383
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,440
Why don't you justcome with me and mommy?

384
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,000
Because I can't leave here,and you can't leave me.

385
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,070
Please.

386
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,040
I don't want to be alone.

387
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:15,740
Tyler!

388
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,300
Tyler!

389
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,600
Mommy!

390
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,700
Is thereanother entrance?

391
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,600
Around back.

392
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,490
All right,let's go.

393
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,550
Keep working.

394
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,440
It'll all be over soon.

395
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:01,990
Stand back.

396
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,940
Son of a bitch.

397
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,530
Margaret.

398
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,400
Margaret.

399
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,150
Oh,thank god.

400
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,470
Thank god.

401
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,500
Mommy?

402
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,000
Yeah,baby,I'm here.

403
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,340
Tyler,do you see maggieanywhere?

404
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,910
No,she's gone.

405
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:48,830
You'd reallydo that for me?

406
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,020
Yes...

407
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,980
if you did,I'd let them go.

408
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,630
But I don't understand.

409
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,510
You kept me awayfor so long.

410
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:11,100
I thoughtyou didn't love me anymore.

411
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,770
Okay...

412
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,950
little sister.

413
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,590
Don't worry,honey.

414
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,580
We're leaving in two minutes.

415
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,870
We just got to get grandma.

416
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:40,720
I don't get it.

417
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,790
Did maggie just stop?

418
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,380
Seems like it.

419
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,900
Where the helldid she go?

420
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,490
Paramedics saidit was another stroke.

421
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,220
Do you think...

422
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,170
margaret could have hadsomething to do with it?

423
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:22,820
We don't know.

424
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,560
But it's possible,yeah.

425
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,610
Susan,I'm sorry.

426
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,700
You have nothingto apologize for.

427
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,240
You've given me everything.

428
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,180
Ready to go,kiddo?

429
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,040
Yeah.

430
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,130
Tyler,you're sure maggie'snot around anymore?

431
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:43,990
I'm sure.

432
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:44,940
I'd see her.

433
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:53,070
I guess whatever's going onmust be over.

434
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,790
You two take care of yourselves,all right?

435
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,610
Thank you.

436
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:07,280
Yeah.

437
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,190
Both of you.

438
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,010
Think you could have hooked upsome milf action there,bud.

439
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,300
Serious,I think she liked you.

440
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,210
Yeah,that's all she needs.

441
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,730
Well,you saved the mom,you saved the girl.

442
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:29,820
XXXXXXXXXXXXX'Course,you know,I could have saved them myself,

443
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,590
but I didn't want youto feel useless.

444
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,560
All right,I appreciate it.

445
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,670

Yeah,it does.

But it doesn't change what wetalked about last night,dean.
