1
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,150
Look,dad's gone now,

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,120
and we have to carry out his legacy -- 

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,970
hunting down as many evil sons of bitches as we possibly can.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,100
John: Back in 1835,samuel colt made a gun for a hunter.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,860
This gun can kill anything.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,770
There's only four bullets left.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,590
Without em,this gun is useless.

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,540
Only thing it's good for now is figuring out what makes it tick.

9
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,430
Cute piece.Won't stop a demon.

10
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,600
How the hell would you know?

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,250
Call it an educated guess.

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,800
Do you want me to help you out with that gun or not?

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,770
That deal you made to save sam -- 

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,930
a year left.

15
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,330
Been kind of liberating,actually.

16
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,960
You're not scared?

17
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,210
Of course not.

18
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:55,780
How certain are you that what you brought back is 100% pure sam?

19
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,300
You think something's wrong with my brother?

20
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,380
Demons lie.I'm sure sam's okay.

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,220
Yeah,me too.

22
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,810
now

23
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,080
Hey,what was that?

24
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,210
I don't know,a dog maybe.

25
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,650
It was a hell of a dog.

26
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,010
Okay,we got a crew coming in the morning.

27
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,370
Look at this wood,huh?

28
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,780
Look at it.It's crap.

29
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,970
Where'd you order it from?

30
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,100
Same place as always.

31
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,440
Should have used the cinder block like I wanted.

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,620
-Here we go again. -You are not in charge.

33
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,860
You're a bunch of girls.

34
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,500
Look,it comes down to this,okay?

35
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,620
One gust of wind,and the whole place is gonna blow over.

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,360
Whatever.

37
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,290
Did you hear that? -Hear what?

38
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,040
Kyle,come on.Let's go.

39
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,800
Okay,I'm gonna go warm up the truck.

40
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,020

00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,750
I don't understand,dean.Why not?

46
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,300
Because I said so.

47
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,950
We got the colt now. -Sam.

48
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:58,160
We can summon the crossroads demon,pull the gun on her,and force her to let you out of the deal.

49
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,200
We'll just shoot her!If she dies,the deal goes away!

50
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,620
We don't know if that will work either,sam!

51
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,160
You're pitching me a bunch of "ifs" and "maybes"!

52
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,330
That's not good enough!

53
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,370
Because if we screw with this deal,you die!

54
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,810
And if we don't screw with it,you die!

55
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,880
Sam,enough!I'm not gonna have this conversation!

56
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,250
Why,because you said so?

57
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,430
Yes,because I said so!

58
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,200
Well,you're not dad!

59
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,500
No,but I am the oldest.

60
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,950
And I'm doing what's best.

61
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,960
You got to let this go.You understand me?

62
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,370
Tell me about the psychotic killer.

63
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,510
Come on,sam,tell me about the psychotic killer.

64
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,810
"The psychotic killer rips victims apart with brute-like ferocity.

65
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:46,210
" Okay,any mention of his razor-sharp teeth or his 4-inch claws,animal eyes?

66
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,880
No.

67
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,410
The lunar cycle's right.

68
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,770
Look,if it is a werewolf,we don't have long.

69
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,870
Moon's full this friday,and that's the last time it changes for a month.

70
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,530
Two days.No sweat.

71
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,330
I'm detective plant.This is detective page.

72
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,290
We're with the county sheriff's department.

73
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,400
Yeah,I've been expecting you.

74
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,610
All morning.

75
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,940
You are the sketch artts,right?

76
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,570
absolutely.

77
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,430
That is exactly who my partner is.

78
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,450
The things he can do with a pen.

79
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,430
But listen,before we get started on that,I wanted to ask you -- how'd you get away?

80
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,130
I-I have no idea.

81
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,690
I was hiding,and he found me.

82
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,520
He was coming right for me,and then he just stopped.

83
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,810
Stared at me with this blank look.

84
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,330
After that,he just took off running.

85
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,650
Okay.

86
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,040
Um,I'm gonna need as much physical detail as you can remember.

87
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,670
he was about 6' tall...

88
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,120
Dark hair.

89
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,270
Um,what about his eyes?What color eyes did he have?

90
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,840
Maybe...

91
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,040
blue?

92
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,500
It was dark.

93
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,530
Did they seem,uh,animal-ish?

94
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,840
Excuse me?

95
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,370
What about his teeth?You notice anything strange about them?

96
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,300
No,they were just teeth.

97
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,300
Teeth.Okay.

98
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,120
How about his fingernails?

99
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,820
Okay,look,he's -- he's just a normal guy with normal eyes and teeth and fingernails.

100
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,850
Look,sir,it's okay -- no.

101
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,640
No.Those were my brothers.

102
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,740
This guy...

103
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,680
he killed my brothers.

104
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,220
How would you feel?

105
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,470
Can't imagine anything worse.

106
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,530
I know this isn't easy,but if you could remember any more details...

107
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,060
there was one more thing.He had a -- 

108
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,310
a tattoo on his arm of a cartoon character.

109
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:09,660
Uh,ugh,it's the guy who -- he's chasing the roadrunner.

110
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,450
Wile E.Coyote.

111
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,510
Yeah,that's it.

112
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,820
Kyle?

113
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,030
Dr.Garrison.

114
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,080
How you holding up?

115
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,520
Okay,considering...

116
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,130
you're,uh,kyle's doctor?

117
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,500
Yes.

118
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,200
Can I just ask you a few questions?

119
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,870
Sure.

120
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,300
Don't I get to see it?

121
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,060
Um,yeah,it's a,you know,work in progress.

122
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,350
It's really...

123
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,940
Boy,this is a piece of art,really.

124
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,900
Yeah,like you could have done any better.

125
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,420
So,what did the doc have to say about kyle's brothers?

126
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,200
Not much.They were D.O.A.At the scene.

127
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,130
He did give me the lowdown on the coroner's report.

128
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,060
Their hearts were missing.

129
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,920
Nope,but chunks of their kidneys,lungs,and intestines.

130
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,130
That's just gross.

131
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,390
Yeah,alefinitely not werewolf behavior.

132
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,610
So,what -- demon?

133
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,820
Attacker could have been possessed.

134
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,780
Why would a demon stop halfway through an attack?

135
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:20,130
I think that,uh,could've -- yeah,I got nothing.

136
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,780
Me,neither.

137
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,510
Okay,I am starving.

138
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,210
Wait,where are all the powerbars?

139
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,550
You ate them all.

140
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,920
And we're lost.

141
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,200
We're not lost.The path is right here.

142
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,200
Look.

143
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,960
There.

144
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,560
Civilization.

145
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,370
Thank god.

146
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,680
Are you two doing okay?

147
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,970
Hi,actually we're -- lost.

148
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,290
Oh,it happens.

149
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,660
The trail gets twisty,and my house is the only one left up here.

150
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,480
I could point you in the right direction,but I'm afraid it'll take a while to get back.

151
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,240
You're really deep into the woods.

152
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,710
Nice work,ken.

153
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,290
Would you like to come in and rest a bit?

154
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,600
Thanks,but we should head back.

155
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,010
Come on,honey.She offered.

156
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,590
She's a harmless old lady.What could happen?

157
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,580
You sure you don't want more?

158
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,110
No,thank you.It's,uh...

159
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,950
I'm full.

160
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,870
We should go.

161
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,500
We really can't thank you enough.

162
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,270
What's going on?

163
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:44,080
Are we -- did she drug us?

164
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,890
Stop.

165
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,750
Please,you have to stop.

166
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,820
Don't worry.

167
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,890
Everything's fine.

168
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,390
You just hold still now,dear.

169
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,170
Stop it!

170
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,200
Stop!

171
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,830
Why are you doing this to us?

172
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,370
ComPlease.

173
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:06,650
We need to observe you while the drugs still may be in your system.

174
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,360
I have things to do,arrangements I need to make.

175
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,090
It can wait.

176
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,960
Now,you need to rest.

177
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,450
Stay,please.

178
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,580
I'll be back in a few minutes.

179
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,220
Detectives.

180
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,960
Dr.Garrison.

181
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,650
What the hell's going on here?

182
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,010
My whole town's going insane.

183
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,680
We'll let you know as soon as we do.

184
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,180
Miss watson?

185
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,070
Need to ask you a few questions.

186
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,400
Do we have to go over this again?

187
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,640
Now?

188
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,450
We'll try to be brief.

189
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,880
Miss watson,can you tell us how you got away?

190
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,620
I didn't eat as much as ken did,so I wasn't as out of it.

191
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,870
And when the old woman was...

192
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,970
carving up ken,I shoved her.

193
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,710
And she fell,cracked her head on the stove.

194
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,760
She's dead,right?

195
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,070
I-I killed her?

196
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,020
Do you have any idea why she did this to you?

197
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,560
No.

198
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:27,450
One minute,she's just a sweet old lady,and the next,she was like a monster.

199
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,640
Can you remember anything else?

200
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,480
Did you find a little girl there,by any chance?

201
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,150
A little girl?

202
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,790
At the house?

203
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,490
I thought I saw her outside the window.

204
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,360
S-she just disappeared...

205
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,820
just vanished into thin air.

206
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,740
It must have been the drugs.

207
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,060
This disappearing girl,what did she look like?

208
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,320
Does it matter?

209
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,750
Yes,every detail matters.

210
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:13,070
She had this dark,dark hair and really pale skin.

211
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,240
She was around 8.

212
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,530
She was a beautiful child.It was...

213
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:23,080
odd to see her in the middle of something so horrible.

214
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,500
Well,there's no sulfur anywhere.

215
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,120
How about the emf?

216
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,370
Yeah,it's going nuts when I went over here by the window.

217
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,060
There was definitely a spirit here.

218
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,560
Who stood outside the crime scene and watched?

219
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,800
Looks like.

220
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,960
What the hell do you make of that?

221
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,400
Actually,I do have a theory.

222
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,990
Uh,sort of.

223
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,870
Hit me.

224
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,480
Well,thinking about fairy tales.

225
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,350
Oh,that's -- that's nice.

226
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,970
You think about fairy tales often?

227
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,850
No,dean,I'm talking about the murders.

228
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,040
A guy and a girl hiking through the woods.

229
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,610
An old lady tries to eat them.

230
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,960
That's "hansel and gretel.

231
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,320
" Then we got the three brothers arguing over how to build houses attacked by the big bad wolf.

232
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,160
"Three little pigs.

233
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,310
Actually,those guys were a little chubby.

234
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:19,240
Well,wait,I thought all those things ended with everybody living happily ever after.

235
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,600
No,no.Not the originals.

236
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:26,450
See,the grimm brothers' stuff was kind of like the folklore of its day -- full of sex,violence,cannibalism.

237
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:31,780
Then it got sanitized over the years,turned into disney flicks and bedtime stories.

238
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,190
So,you think the murders are,what,a re-enactment?

239
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,280
It's a little crazy.

240
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,410
As crazy as what?

241
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,060
Every day of our lives?

242
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,640
Touch?

243
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,430
How's the creepy ghost girl involved?

244
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,960
Um,she must have been here for a reason.

245
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,460
I'm willing to bet you top dollar she was at the construction site,too.

246
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,180
We got to do research now,don't we?

247
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,590
-So? -Checked every record they had.

248
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,380
Found the usual amount of violent childhood deaths for a town this size.

249
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,810
Do you want to know how many were little girls with black hair and pale skin?

250
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,520
Zero.

251
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,720
Do you want to know how many little girls with black hair and pale skin have gone missing?

252
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,930
Right again.

253
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,170
Zip,zilch,nada.

254
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,250
Tell me you got something good,'cause I've totally wasted the last six hours.

255
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,830
Well,you ever hear of lilian bailey?

256
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,590
She was a british medium from the 1930s.

257
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,150
She got a thing for fairy tales?

258
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,490
No,trances.

259
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:31,360
See,she'd go into these unconscious states where,um -- 

260
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:36,270
get this -- her thoughts and actions were completely controlled by spirits.

261
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,190
A ghost puppet master?

262
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,730
You think that's what this kid is doing?

263
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,320
Sending wolf boy and grandma into trances and making them go kill-crazy?

264
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,110
Could be.

265
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,000
You know,kind of like a spirit hypnosis or something.

266
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,550
Trances I get,but fairy-tale trances?

267
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,370
That's bizarre,even for us.

268
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,850
you're right.That's completely normal.

269
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,740
All right,maybe it is fairy tales 

270
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,960
-- totally messed-up fairy tales.

271
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,710
I'll tell you one thing.There's no way I'm kissing a damn frog.

272
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,430
Hey,check that out.

273
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,640
Yeah,it's close to halloween.

274
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,030
You remember cinderella?

275
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,320
The pumpkin that turns into a coach and the mice that become horses.

276
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,920
Dude,could you be more gay?

277
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,380
Don't answer that.

278
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,710
Oh,who knows?Maybe you'll find your fairy godmother.

279
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,870
Help!I'm in here!

280
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,280
It's okay.We're here.We got you.

281
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,400
You have to help me.She's a lunatic. -what happened

282
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,500
My stepmom -- she just freaked out,screamed at me,beat me,chained me up.

283
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,440
Where is she now? -idont know

284
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,300
Sam.

285
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,040
Who are you?

286
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,910
Paramedics picked up cinderella.

287
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,200
That's good.

288
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,030
So,little girl,shiny red apple.

289
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,070
That means something to you,fairy-tale boy?

290
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,710
I think it's snow white.

291
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,240
"Snow white"?Oh,I saw that movie.

292
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,820
Oh,the porn version,anyways.

293
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,980
There was this wicked stepmother -- she was wicked.

294
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,580
There is a wicked stepmother,and she tries to kill snow white with a poison apple.

295
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,600
But the apple doesn't actually kill the girl,right?

296
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,680
No.

297
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,360
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

298
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,370
No,sorry.We don't have any comatose little girls.

299
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,140
You sure? -Totally.

300
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,440
It's mostly old guys,and,well,callie.

301
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,210
She's been around since before I started here.

302
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,450
Callie?

303
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,780
It's so sad.

304
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,130
Poor dr.Garrison -- he won't give up on her.

305
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,480
Was callie one of his patients?

306
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,510
No,his daughter.

307
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,620
Dr.Here we are.

308
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,360
Just press the latch,' called out the grandmother.

309
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,570
I'm too weak to get up.

310
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,610
The wolf pressed the latch,and the door opened.

311
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:09,320
"He stepped inside,went straight to the grandmother,and ate her up.

312
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,000
Thank you so much.

313
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:49,610
The huntsman stepped inside,and in the bed lay the wolf.

314
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:55,410
"So,the huntsman took a pair of scissors and cut open the wolf's belly.

315
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,960
Detectives,can I help you?

316
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,520
We just heard that callie is your daughter.

317
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,180
And we wanted to say how very sorry we are.

318
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,160
Well,uh,thank you.

319
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,950
If you'll excuse me...

320
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:23,560
oh,we're heading this way.We'll walk with you.

321
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,420
How long has callie been like that?

322
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,740
W-we don't mean to intrude.

323
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:30,690
We can't possibly understand how hard it must be for you seeing her like this.

324
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,650
Yeah,it's not easy.

325
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,310
She's uh,been here since she was 8 years old.

326
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,710
That's when she was poisoned?

327
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,300
Yeah,swallowed bleach.

328
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,350
Never figured out how she got her hands on te.

329
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,570
Ottl my wife found her,brought her to the E.R.

330
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,100
Here,and I was on call.

331
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,940
Your wife was,uh -- was that callie's stepmother?

332
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,360
Actually,yes.How'd you know that?

333
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,280
Lucky guess.

334
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:06,230
Well,julie was the only mother that callie ever knew.

335
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,080
My wife passed away last year,and,uh

336
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,310
,it's just my daughter and me now.

337
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,130
She's all I got left.

338
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,040
Um,excuse me.I've got to get back to work.

339
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,290
Well,you're right.It's snow white in spades.

340
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,450
Stepmom poisons the girl,puts her into a deep sleep.

341
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,130
What's the motive,you think?

342
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,180
It could be like mischa barton.

343
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,370
"Sixth sense," not "the O.C.

344
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,660
" What?!

345
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,550
Hey,you know fairy tales.I know movies.

346
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,290
She played the pasty ghost.

347
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:49,130
Remember the mom had that thing,you know,where you keep the kid sick so you get all the attention?

348
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,360
Munchausen syndrome by proxy.

349
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,470
Huh,could be.

350
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:55,260
So,say,all these years callie's been suffering silently 

351
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,640
because nobody knows the truth about what mommy dearest did.

352
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,350
And after all this time,her spirit just gets angrier until it finally just starts lashing out.

353
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:07,780
Meanwhile,she has to listen to dad tell her deranged stories about a rabid wolf or a cannibalistic old lady.

354
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,140
It's enough to drive anybody nuts.

355
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,310
Okay,but how are we gonna stop her?

356
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,410
Callie is stuck here.

357
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,090
Her father's keeping her body alive.

358
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,350
That does make it hard to burn the bone you think?

359
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,220
Hey,what's the status?

360
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,550
72-year-old female sustained multiple lacerations and puncture wounds.

361
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,470
B.P.Is 80 over 40 and falling.

362
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,050
Sinus tachycardia.

363
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,400
Is that a bite?

364
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,210
Look like she was mauled by a mad dog or maybe a wolf.

365
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,890
What was the last story dr.Garrison was reading callie?

366
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,940
"Little red riding hood.

367
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,440
" Excuse me.

368
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,940
Was she the only victim?

369
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,520
She was found by the side of the road,barely alive.alone

370
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,680
We need to find her next of kin.

371
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,260
She has a granddaughter.

372
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,080
Do you have an address?

373
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,680
Thank you.

374
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,960
Thanks.

375
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,930
You find a way to stop callie,all right?

376
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,970
What about you?

377
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,880
I'm gonna go stop the big bad wolf...

378
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,950
which is the weirdest thing I've ever said.

379
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,900
Hey,grandma.

380
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,980
Dr.Garrison,

381
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,300
I need to speak with you.

382
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,260
Detective,what can I do for you?

383
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,030
Well,um,it's about callie.

384
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,470
My daughter?What about her?

385
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,560
You know,maybe -- maybe could we sit down for a minute?

386
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,210
No.What about her?

387
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,460
Okay,well,um...

388
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,800
all right,doctor,this isn't gonna be easy.

389
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,910
What happened to callie was not an accident.

390
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:35,970
Excuse me?

391
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,250
I'm sorry,but it's true.

392
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:40,190
You have no idea what happened to my daughter.

393
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,180
There are things you don't know,doctor,about your wife.

394
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,490
My wife?

395
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:48,620
Doctor,your wife poisoned callie.

396
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,780
Why would you say something so horrible to me?

397
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,580
Because I need your help.

398
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,660
You stay away from me and from my daughter.

399
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,230
You understand?

400
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:06,270
Doctor,this is -- please -- 

401
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,320
I'm calling security.

402
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,210
No,listen -- I don't have time to do this gently.

403
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:22,070
If you don't listen to me,more people are gonna get hurt because callie is going to hurt them.

404
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,580
What the hell are you talking about?

405
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,970
You're gonna think I'm crazy,but just understand me.

406
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,950
Your daughter,callie,is still here.

407
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,840
She's a spirit.

408
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,330
So,you've seen her,too?

409
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,020
Are you okay?

410
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,280
I sensed her...

411
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,940
callie.

412
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,810
Her presence,her scent.

413
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:44,760
I even saw her standing at the foot of my bed,but I never 

414
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,430
believed it.I thought I was dreaming.

415
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,310
It wasn't a dream.

416
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:50,790
She looks like she did when she was 8.

417
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:54,650
White dress,red ribbon in her hair.

418
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,550
She's been trying to talk to you.

419
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,390
You're not a cop,are you?

420
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,470
No.

421
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,690
Then who are you?

422
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,950
Someone who knows a little bit about this kind of thing.

423
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:08,070
Well,what you said about my wife poisoning callie,that -- 

424
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,090
sir,callie told us.

425
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,050
What?

426
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,470
Not in so many words.

427
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:17,540
But in her own way,she told us.

428
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,920
My wife loved callie!

429
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,300
So,how's that possible?

430
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,120
I don't know,but it is.

431
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,330
No,no.

432
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,510
I don't believe you.

433
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:27,040
Look,callie is killing people.

434
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,290
She's angry.

435
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,690
She's desperate because nobody will listen to her.

436
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,350
So you have to listen to her.

437
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,900
Please...

438
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,160
listen to your daughter.

439
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,590
Garrison: Callie?

440
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,400
Callie,it's daddy.

441
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,490
It's me,daddy.

442
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,660
Is it true?

443
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,760
Mommy do that to ?

444
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,860
I-I know I wasn't listening before,but I'm listening now.

445
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,140
Daddy's here.

446
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,140
Please,honey,is -- is there any way that you can tell me?

447
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,750
Doctor.

448
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,520
Is it true?

449
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,530
Oh,I'm so sorry,baby.

450
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,960
But listen to me.

451
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,280
You got to stop what you're doing,okay?

452
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,700
You're hurting people.

453
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,610
I know everything now.

454
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,110
I know the truth.

455
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:31,660
It's time for you to let go.

456
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,370
It's time for me to let you go.

457
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,460
Stop!

458
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,590
Where -- where am I?

459
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,340
What?

460
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,480
r and the girl's okay?

461
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,340
So...

462
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,150
it's really over.

463
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,410
All thanks to you.

464
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:02,510
Callie was the most important thing in my life,

465
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,540
but I should have let her go a long time ago.

466
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,440
See you around,doc.

467
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,180
I sure hope not.

468
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,950
You know what he said.

469
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,470
Some good advice.

470
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,050
Is that what you want me to do,dean?

471
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,680
Just let you go?

472
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,960
Well,little sammy winchester.

473
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,740
I'm touched.

474
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:38,660
I mean,your brother's been to see me twice,but you...

475
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,740
I never had the pleasure.

476
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,550
What can I do for you,sam?

477
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,260
You can beg for your life.

478
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,520
We were having such a nice conversation.

479
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,360
Then you had to go and ruin the mood.

480
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,750
If I were you,I'd drop the wisecracks and start acting scared.

481
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,050
It's not my style.

482
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,420
That's not the original colt.

483
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,400
Where did you get that?

484
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,840
Ruby.

485
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,540
Had to be.

486
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,340
She is such a pain in my ass.

487
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,560
She'll get what's coming to her.

488
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,450
You can count on it.

489
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,640
That's enough.

490
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,170
I came here to make you an offer.

491
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,220
You're gonna make me an offer?

492
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,370
That's adorable.

493
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:34,890
You can let dean out of his deal right now.

494
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:38,200
He lives,I live,you live.

495
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,230
Everyone goes home happy.

496
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,990
Or...

497
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,720
You stop breathing.

498
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,410
Permanently.

499
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,730
All this tough talk.

500
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:03,980
I got to tell you,it's not very convincing.

501
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,420
I mean,come on,sam.

502
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,490
Do you even want to break the deal?

503
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,210
What do you think?

504
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,460
I don't know.

505
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:18,950
Aren't you tired of cleaning up dean's messes,of dealing with that broken psyche of his?

506
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:22,830
Aren't you tired of being bossed around like a snot-nosed little brother?

507
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,570
You're stronger than dean.

508
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,760
You're better than him.

509
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,850
Watch your mouth.

510
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:33,430
Admit it -- you're here,going through the motions,but truth is,you'll be a tiny bit relieved when he's gone.

511
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:38,290
Shut up. -No more desperate,sloppy,needy dean.

512
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,710
You can finally be free.

513
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:44,450
I said,"shut up.

514
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,840
Doth protest too much,if you ask me.

515
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,640
All right,I've had enough of your crap.

516
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,640
You let dean out of his deal right now.

517
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,310
Sorry,sweetheart,but your brother's an adult.

518
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:02,850
He made that deal of his own free will,fair and square.

519
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,690
It's ironclad.

520
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,430
Every deal can be broken.

521
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,930
Not this one.

522
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,200
Fine.Then I'll kill you.

523
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,910
If you're gone,so is the deal.

524
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,230
Guess again.

525
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:16,960
What?

526
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,650
Sam,I'm just a saleswoman.

527
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,390
I got a boss,like everybody.

528
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:24,020
He holds the contract,not me.

529
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,210
He wants dean's soul bad.

530
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,560
And believe me,he's not gonna let it go.

531
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,690
You're bluffing.

532
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:30,660
Am I?

533
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,670
Shoot me,if it will get you off,but the deal still holds.
