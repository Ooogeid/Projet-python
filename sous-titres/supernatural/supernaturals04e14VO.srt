1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,521
Your brother is heading down
a dangerous road, Dean.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,846
Okay.

3
00:00:08,367 --> 00:00:09,334
I'm in.

4
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:10,936
You gonna tell Dean
about what we're doing?

5
00:00:10,971 --> 00:00:12,404
I just got to figure out
the right way to say it.

6
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:14,258
He's gonna find out,
and if it's not from you,

7
00:00:14,293 --> 00:00:16,768
- he's gonna be pissed.
- He's gonna pissed anyway.

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,638
You satisfied?

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,281
Why do you trust her so much?

10
00:00:20,307 --> 00:00:22,950
I told you, Dean,
she helped me go after Lilith.

11
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:24,995
Well, thanks for the thumbnail.
Real vivid.

12
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:26,847
Something major must've happened
while I was downstairs,

13
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:28,323
'cause I come back and...

14
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:30,091
And you're bff with a demon?

15
00:00:30,105 --> 00:00:31,993
You want to fill in
a little detail?

16
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:34,351
Sure, Dean.
Let's trade stories.

17
00:00:34,406 --> 00:00:37,300
You first. How was hell?
Don't spare the details.

18
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:02,471
Hey.

19
00:01:06,705 --> 00:01:07,503
What?

20
00:01:08,406 --> 00:01:10,442
Ted's kind of cracking the whip,
isn't he?

21
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:13,763
You think
I like coming home late?

22
00:01:14,805 --> 00:01:16,812
I'm working my ass off.

23
00:01:20,507 --> 00:01:21,503
Sorry.

24
00:01:23,608 --> 00:01:24,682
No, I'm sorry.

25
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:27,641
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,431
Long day.

27
00:01:32,505 --> 00:01:34,623
Oh, hey. I ran
into Jill Martin today.

28
00:01:34,707 --> 00:01:36,773
Gary's turning 40 on saturday.

29
00:01:37,405 --> 00:01:40,011
- Yeah?
- She invited us to the party.

30
00:01:41,108 --> 00:01:43,560
- What'd you tell her?
- That we'd go.

31
00:01:46,808 --> 00:01:47,782
You're kidding.

32
00:01:48,587 --> 00:01:50,802
What? You like Gary.

33
00:01:50,907 --> 00:01:52,100
Yeah, that doesn't mean

34
00:01:52,115 --> 00:01:54,132
that I want to waste
my saturday night with him.

35
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:55,650
I thought you'd want to go.

36
00:02:00,508 --> 00:02:02,131
I don't believe you.

37
00:02:05,305 --> 00:02:06,620
It's fine. I'll,

38
00:02:06,656 --> 00:02:09,123
I'll call Jill and
tell her we can't make it.

39
00:02:12,705 --> 00:02:14,370
What's with you tonight?

40
00:02:14,406 --> 00:02:17,001
It's like you want to
have a fight or something.

00:02:28,076 --> 00:02:29,360
4x14

44
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:46,353
{\a6}Yeah, that's what
I'm telling you.

45
00:02:46,356 --> 00:02:47,670
{\a6}No storms, no.

46
00:02:48,505 --> 00:02:50,713
{\a6}No bad crops, nothing.

47
00:02:55,095 --> 00:02:59,020
{\a6}Okay, I will keep looking.
You keep looking, too, okay?

48
00:02:59,507 --> 00:03:00,891
{\a6}All right, talk soon.

49
00:03:11,006 --> 00:03:12,170
{\a6}Up and at 'em, kiddo.

50
00:03:14,907 --> 00:03:16,953
You're up early.
What are you doing?

51
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:18,500
Nothing. I was in the can.

52
00:03:21,406 --> 00:03:23,432
Yeah. Want me
to draw you a picture?

53
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,950
{\a6}- No, I'll pass.
- I found a job.

54
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:28,390
{\a6}Bedford, Iowa.
Guy beat his wife's brains out

55
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:30,193
- with a meat tenderizer.
- Yikes.

56
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:33,260
And get this. Third local inside
two months to gank his wife.

57
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:35,690
No priors on any of them,
all happily married.

58
00:03:36,605 --> 00:03:38,212
{\a6}Sounds like
"Ozzie and Harriet".

59
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,200
{\a6}More like "The Shining".

60
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:42,660
{\a6}All right, well, I guess
we better have a look.

61
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:46,081
Why does the P.D.
keep sending you guys?

62
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:48,343
{\a6}I already said
I don't want a lawyer.

63
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,643
{\a6}They're lining up
the firing squad.

64
00:03:49,675 --> 00:03:51,260
{\a6}- I'm pleading guilty.
- All right, look,

65
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,701
{\a6}you don't want us
to represent you,

66
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:53,870
that's fine.

67
00:03:54,607 --> 00:03:57,262
In fact, it's probably not
a bad idea, between you and me.

68
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,641
We just want to understand
what happened.

69
00:04:02,005 --> 00:04:03,063
{\a6}That's all.

70
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:05,981
Mr. Benson...

71
00:04:07,406 --> 00:04:08,483
...please.

72
00:04:16,505 --> 00:04:17,970
What happened was...

73
00:04:19,907 --> 00:04:21,830
I killed my wife.

74
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:24,700
And you want to know why?

75
00:04:26,407 --> 00:04:30,371
Because she made plans
without asking me.

76
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:33,801
When it happened,

77
00:04:33,827 --> 00:04:36,993
how did you feel?
Disoriented? Out of control?

78
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:38,402
Like something
possessed you to do it?

79
00:04:38,438 --> 00:04:41,942
I knew exactly what I was doing.
I was crystal clear.

80
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:44,171
- Then why did you do it?
- I don't know.

81
00:04:44,205 --> 00:04:47,342
I loved her.
We were happy.

82
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:02,313
{\a6}9 g's.

83
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:05,033
{\a6}That's a hefty bill.

84
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,192
- Where did you get that?
- Doesn't matter. We have it.

85
00:05:09,505 --> 00:05:11,373
See, certain charges,

86
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:13,121
ones you don't want
the missus to know,

87
00:05:13,905 --> 00:05:17,951
they show up under shady names
like "M & C Entertainment".

88
00:05:17,987 --> 00:05:19,223
Yeah, I don't know
what you're talking about.

89
00:05:19,256 --> 00:05:21,492
Oh, you're dropping plastic
at a nudie bar, for instance.

90
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:22,492
{\a6}We just...

91
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:24,760
{\a6}want to know the truth,
Mr. Benson.

92
00:05:32,005 --> 00:05:33,291
Her name was...

93
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:35,493
Jasmine.

94
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:37,903
{\a6}She was a stripper?

95
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:39,742
{\a6}Dude,
her name was Jasmine.

96
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:42,402
{\a6}I didn't mean for it
to happen.

97
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:44,642
I don't like
to go to strip bars.

98
00:05:44,705 --> 00:05:47,153
My buddy was having
a bachelor party,

99
00:05:48,008 --> 00:05:48,861
and...

100
00:05:49,426 --> 00:05:50,840
there she was.

101
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:54,993
- Jasmine.
- She came right up to me. And...

102
00:05:57,507 --> 00:05:59,500
I don't know, she was just...

103
00:06:01,406 --> 00:06:02,833
perfect.

104
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:06,443
- Everything that I wanted.
- Well, you pay enough,

105
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:09,242
- anybody will be anything.
- It wasn't about the money.

106
00:06:09,508 --> 00:06:12,101
It wasn't even about the sex.
It was...

107
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:15,981
I don't know.

108
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:22,080
I don't know what it was.
It's hard to explain.

109
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:26,131
And your wife found out?

110
00:06:26,165 --> 00:06:27,983
No, she never had a clue.

111
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:29,773
Then why'd you kill her?

112
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:33,902
For Jasmine.

113
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:38,150
She said we would be
together forever,

114
00:06:39,406 --> 00:06:41,910
if, if only J... Vicki was...

115
00:06:43,406 --> 00:06:44,410
Muerte.

116
00:06:45,006 --> 00:06:47,273
Afterwards, me and Jasmine
were supposed to meet,

117
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:48,831
and she never showed.

118
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:52,313
I don't know where she lives.
I don't know her last name.

119
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,122
I don't even know
her real first name.

120
00:06:58,905 --> 00:06:59,942
I'm an idiot.

121
00:06:59,977 --> 00:07:02,333
And you didn't think
to tell this to the cops?

122
00:07:02,405 --> 00:07:03,690
What for?

123
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:08,371
The stripper didn't do it.
I did it.

124
00:07:09,306 --> 00:07:11,173
And I know what I deserve.

125
00:07:14,306 --> 00:07:17,562
Judge doesn't give me the death
sentence, I'll just do it myself.

126
00:07:28,008 --> 00:07:29,971
- Rough night?
- Fun night.

127
00:07:30,006 --> 00:07:31,153
Rough morning.

128
00:07:32,508 --> 00:07:33,931
Can I help you?

129
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:38,833
I'm special agent Stiles,
F.B.I.

130
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:41,713
- You're Dr. Cara Roberts?
- Far as I know.

131
00:07:42,406 --> 00:07:44,383
You do some work with
the sheriff's department?

132
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:47,860
Yeah, when I'm not slogging it
through the E.R.

133
00:07:49,008 --> 00:07:50,740
It's a small town.
We multitask.

134
00:07:50,775 --> 00:07:52,151
Well, I have some questions
about a case.

135
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:54,631
About several cases, actually.
You mind if I sit?

136
00:07:55,115 --> 00:07:56,112
Great.

137
00:07:56,147 --> 00:07:59,783
Adam Benson, Jim Wylie,
and Steve Snyder?

138
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:02,113
Oh, yeah. The men
who killed their wives.

139
00:08:02,155 --> 00:08:03,562
You handled the work-ups,
right?

140
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:07,123
Autopsies for the wives
and tox screens for the perps.

141
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:08,531
Two-for-one special.

142
00:08:09,007 --> 00:08:11,251
- You find anything?
- Not really.

143
00:08:11,305 --> 00:08:13,940
I mean, C.O.D. on the women
was pretty clear...

144
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:15,525
There was nothing unusual
in their system.

145
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:16,847
What about the husbands?

146
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:19,593
Can I see your badge again?

147
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,052
There was one thing.

148
00:08:30,506 --> 00:08:32,270
An anomaly in the blood work.

149
00:08:32,286 --> 00:08:34,371
And I remember thinking
how strange it was

150
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:36,083
that it showed up

151
00:08:36,087 --> 00:08:38,320
in all three of the men.

152
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:40,372
- That what showed up?
- Oxytocin.

153
00:08:40,405 --> 00:08:43,573
And their levels were crazy high.

154
00:08:43,808 --> 00:08:45,383
Oxytocin?

155
00:08:45,706 --> 00:08:48,642
It's a hormone
that's produced during

156
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:52,732
childbirth, lactation, and sex.

157
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:57,301
- Okay.
- People call it the love hormone.

158
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:59,521
Um, you know how it feels
when you first fall in love?

159
00:08:59,548 --> 00:09:02,723
The whole weak-in-the-knees,
tattoo-you-on-my-chest thing?

160
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:04,703
That's oxytocin.

161
00:09:05,908 --> 00:09:07,092
Of course,
it eventually fades,

162
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:10,230
and then you're stuck with
every relationship ever,

163
00:09:10,906 --> 00:09:14,682
that and the painful
regimen of tattoo removal.

164
00:09:19,006 --> 00:09:20,163
What'd I miss?

165
00:09:20,507 --> 00:09:22,642
This is my partner, Agent Murdock.

166
00:09:22,677 --> 00:09:24,253
Please, "agent" sounds so formal.

167
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:26,873
- You can call me Dean.
- I'm Dr. Roberts.

168
00:09:27,407 --> 00:09:28,313
So, um...

169
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:31,113
Can I help you
with anything else?

170
00:09:32,987 --> 00:09:34,923
Sure. Just one more thing.
This chemical,

171
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:36,033
- this...
- Oxytocin...

172
00:09:36,065 --> 00:09:37,312
Oxytocin,

173
00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:39,730
what would cause
those high levels that you found?

174
00:09:40,906 --> 00:09:42,622
Nothing that I've ever seen.

175
00:09:45,305 --> 00:09:47,792
Okay. That's it.
Thanks, doc.

176
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:56,851
By the way, uh,

177
00:09:57,568 --> 00:09:59,180
try a greasy breakfast.

178
00:09:59,227 --> 00:10:00,773
Best thing for a hangover.

179
00:10:00,816 --> 00:10:03,201
Watch it, buddy.
I'm the only M.D. Here.

180
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:09,722
Dude,
you totally c-blocked me.

181
00:10:12,008 --> 00:10:14,410
So, Wylie and Snyder
fessed up, huh?

182
00:10:14,468 --> 00:10:17,030
One emptied his I.R.A.,
the other, his kid's college fund...

183
00:10:17,106 --> 00:10:18,311
All on the same thing.

184
00:10:18,355 --> 00:10:19,430
Live nude girls?

185
00:10:19,905 --> 00:10:21,532
Club called "The Honey Wagon".

186
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,753
These guys have affairs, too,
with a stripper also known as Jasmine?

187
00:10:24,797 --> 00:10:26,951
Yes and no.
This is where it gets interesting.

188
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:28,621
Each guy hooked up
with a different chick.

189
00:10:29,405 --> 00:10:31,081
So, what, these girls
all connected somehow?

190
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:32,991
Well, they all described
their stripper

191
00:10:32,997 --> 00:10:34,732
in the same way,
the exact same way.

192
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,551
Perfect and everything
that they wanted.

193
00:10:37,007 --> 00:10:37,942
Yeah,
at least they'll dream

194
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:39,611
Barbie convinced them
to murder their wives.

195
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:41,161
- There's that.
- You know, it's almost like

196
00:10:41,228 --> 00:10:42,523
they were
under some kind of love spell.

197
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,220
- Sure seems that way.
- Which caused them

198
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,650
- to become totally psychotic.
- Absolutely.

199
00:10:48,508 --> 00:10:50,050
You seem pretty cheery.

200
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,400
Strippers, Sammy. Strippers.

201
00:10:52,505 --> 00:10:53,903
We are on an actual case

202
00:10:53,907 --> 00:10:55,330
involving strippers.

203
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:56,493
Finally.

204
00:10:57,508 --> 00:10:59,282
- "Thunder Kiss '65"
by White Zombie -

205
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:18,813
I'm looking for three girls,

206
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:21,971
Jasmine, Aurora, and Ariel.

207
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:24,482
You seriously think those names
mean anything to me?

208
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:27,072
One's a redhead about 5'9".
The other one's asian about...

209
00:11:27,137 --> 00:11:29,602
Do you have any idea
how many girls I deal with?

210
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,913
Fake names, fake hair, fake...

211
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:34,983
You got to have some sort
of paperwork, check stubs,

212
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:36,891
some way to keep track
of the strippers.

213
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,371
Please. Exotic dancers?

214
00:11:39,418 --> 00:11:41,342
Independent contractors
working for cash.

215
00:11:41,408 --> 00:11:42,821
I stay out of their hair.

216
00:11:42,905 --> 00:11:44,582
They stay out of
what little I have left.

217
00:11:44,605 --> 00:11:46,940
Three of your customers
murdered their wives.

218
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,642
You don't think that
that's weird?

219
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,032
Yeah, I think
that's super-freakin' weird.

220
00:11:51,065 --> 00:11:53,132
But you know what it ain't?
My problem.

221
00:12:07,507 --> 00:12:08,430
Any luck?

222
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:11,513
- No. You?
- A little.

223
00:12:11,548 --> 00:12:14,150
I just talked to Bobby.
We officially have a theory.

224
00:12:14,206 --> 00:12:15,893
- What's that?
- Siren.

225
00:12:16,557 --> 00:12:19,120
Like greek-myth siren?
Like "The Odyssey"?

226
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,003
Hey, I read.

227
00:12:21,046 --> 00:12:23,500
Yeah, actually, but
the siren's not actually a myth.

228
00:12:23,538 --> 00:12:26,180
It's more of a beautiful creature
that prey on men,

229
00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:28,411
entice them with their siren song.

230
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:30,162
Let me guess,
"Welcome to the jungle"?

231
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,170
No, no. Warrant's "Cherry Pie"?

232
00:12:32,507 --> 00:12:34,712
Their song is more of a metaphor,
like

233
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:36,641
like their call, their lure,
you know?

234
00:12:36,665 --> 00:12:38,871
So they shake their thing and
the guys zombie out?

235
00:12:38,907 --> 00:12:39,892
Basically, yeah.

236
00:12:39,907 --> 00:12:42,490
Sirens live on islands.
Sailors would chase them,

237
00:12:42,526 --> 00:12:44,001
completely ignoring
the rocky shores,

238
00:12:44,038 --> 00:12:45,583
and dash themselves to pieces.

239
00:12:45,627 --> 00:12:46,962
Sounds like
Adam and his buddies.

240
00:12:47,647 --> 00:12:50,370
If you were a siren in '09 and
looking to ruin a bunch of morons,

241
00:12:50,405 --> 00:12:52,061
where would you set up shop?

242
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:02,151
So, whatever floats the guy's boat,
that's what they look like?

243
00:13:02,185 --> 00:13:04,021
Yeah. You see,
sirens can read minds.

244
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:06,150
They see what you want most,
and then they can kind of,

245
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,653
like, cloak themselves,
you know, like an illusion.

246
00:13:10,008 --> 00:13:11,950
So it could all be
the same chick,

247
00:13:12,507 --> 00:13:15,130
morphing into
different dream girls?

248
00:13:15,176 --> 00:13:18,320
Yeah, actually. Probably.
Sirens are usually pretty solitary.

249
00:13:20,308 --> 00:13:22,803
- How do we kill it?
- Bobby's working on it.

250
00:13:22,848 --> 00:13:24,071
But even if
we figure that out...

251
00:13:24,076 --> 00:13:26,381
How the hell are we gonna find it?
It could be anybody.

252
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:36,251
Hi, Belle.

253
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:40,052
Thought you'd never come.

254
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:03,561
It's okay. She's asleep.

255
00:14:03,905 --> 00:14:06,000
Lenny, you're amazing...

256
00:14:07,408 --> 00:14:09,590
Taking care of her like this.

257
00:14:10,005 --> 00:14:12,692
Most guys would have put her
in a nursing home.

258
00:14:13,706 --> 00:14:15,161
It's no big deal.

259
00:14:15,806 --> 00:14:17,083
She's my mom.

260
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,641
Like I said,

261
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,431
amazing.

262
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:11,111
Baby...

263
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:17,030
...I love you so much.

264
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:21,833
The way you take care of
me and your mom...

265
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:25,763
You're so sweet...

266
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:28,643
And strong.

267
00:15:29,806 --> 00:15:31,943
I just wish
you didn't have to carry it all.

268
00:15:33,505 --> 00:15:36,730
I mean, your mom takes up
all your time.

269
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,852
As long as she's around,

270
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,431
we can't really be happy.

271
00:15:44,507 --> 00:15:46,150
She's not so bad.

272
00:15:46,957 --> 00:15:49,200
I could be with you...

273
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:51,453
Forever...

274
00:15:53,506 --> 00:15:55,431
If only your mom wasn't here.

275
00:15:57,508 --> 00:15:59,752
Don't you want
to be with me forever?

276
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,270
Yeah, you know I do.

277
00:16:11,907 --> 00:16:14,120
Then bash
your mother's brains in.

278
00:16:16,905 --> 00:16:18,573
Baby, do it for me.

279
00:16:19,808 --> 00:16:21,110
Do it, baby.

280
00:16:21,206 --> 00:16:22,662
Yeah, okay.

281
00:16:24,006 --> 00:16:25,302
If you say so.

282
00:16:33,506 --> 00:16:34,840
I love you.

283
00:17:40,008 --> 00:17:40,942
<i>Hey, Sam.</i>

284
00:17:43,116 --> 00:17:44,321
<i>You there?</i>

285
00:17:51,808 --> 00:17:54,693
Lenny Bristol
was definitely another siren vic.

286
00:17:54,747 --> 00:17:56,222
- You got in to see him?
- Yep.

287
00:17:56,238 --> 00:17:57,921
Said he brought
a stripper home named Belle.

288
00:17:57,926 --> 00:17:59,821
Couple hours later,
he offed his mother.

289
00:17:59,856 --> 00:18:02,772
- Belle, of course, went M.I.A.
- Wait. He killed his mom?

290
00:18:03,005 --> 00:18:04,673
Woman he was closest to.

291
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:08,041
Yeah, you, uh...

292
00:18:08,507 --> 00:18:09,842
forgot your cellphone.

293
00:18:17,106 --> 00:18:19,023
<i>Sam, did you find her yet?</i>

294
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:20,552
Uh, no,

295
00:18:20,906 --> 00:18:22,982
and doesn't seem like
<i>she's slowing down any.</i>

296
00:18:22,986 --> 00:18:24,612
<i>What about you?
Got anything?</i>

297
00:18:24,658 --> 00:18:27,400
Well, some lore
from a dusty greek poem.

298
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,171
<i>- Shockingly, it's a little vague.</i>
- Oh, hold on a sec.

299
00:18:30,216 --> 00:18:31,373
I'm gonna put you on speaker.

300
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:34,350
<i>It says you need
"a bronze dagger"</i>

301
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:38,611
"covered in the blood of a sailor
under the spell of the song".

302
00:18:39,005 --> 00:18:41,141
- What the hell does that mean?
<i>- You got me.</i>

303
00:18:41,206 --> 00:18:44,181
We're dealing with 3,000 years
of the telephone game here.

304
00:18:44,205 --> 00:18:45,312
Best guess?

305
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:49,451
<i>The siren's spell ain't got
nothing to do with any song.</i>

306
00:18:49,497 --> 00:18:53,000
It's most likely
some kind of toxin or venom.

307
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:54,862
<i>Something she gets
in the vics' blood.</i>

308
00:18:54,905 --> 00:18:56,880
That makes them
go all manchurian candidate.

309
00:18:56,908 --> 00:18:59,392
Uh, what do you think?
She infects the men during sex?

310
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:00,433
<i>Maybe.</i>

311
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:02,373
Supernatural std.

312
00:19:02,405 --> 00:19:04,101
<i>Well, however it happens,</i>

313
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,861
once it's done, the siren's
got to watch her back.

314
00:19:06,865 --> 00:19:08,373
<i>If she gets
a dose of her own medicine...</i>

315
00:19:08,407 --> 00:19:09,773
It kills her.

316
00:19:09,806 --> 00:19:12,293
Like a snake
getting iced by its own venom.

317
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:14,591
So we just got to find a way
to juice one of the O.J.S in jail?

318
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:15,631
<i>It's not that easy.</i>

319
00:19:15,668 --> 00:19:17,872
None of those guys
are under the spell anymore.

320
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:20,712
<i>Haven't got a clue where
you're gonna get the blood you need.</i>

321
00:19:21,905 --> 00:19:23,213
I think I might have an idea.

322
00:19:23,305 --> 00:19:24,552
<i>Be careful.</i>

323
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:26,663
These things are tricky bitches.

324
00:19:26,718 --> 00:19:29,213
Wrap you up in knots
before you know what hit you.

325
00:19:33,808 --> 00:19:34,831
Dr. Roberts.

326
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:36,090
Agent Stiles.

327
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:38,291
Can't stay away, huh?

328
00:19:41,007 --> 00:19:43,381
Actually, we're here
on business about the,

329
00:19:43,387 --> 00:19:45,812
the blood samples,
the ones with the high...

330
00:19:46,506 --> 00:19:48,741
...you know, oxytocin.

331
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:51,473
Do you still have them?

332
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:55,483
- Good. We need them.
- What for?

333
00:19:55,507 --> 00:19:57,950
Excuse me, Dr. Roberts?

334
00:19:58,008 --> 00:19:59,712
- Yeah?
- Excuse me.

335
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:01,771
We're a little busy here,
buddy.

336
00:20:03,006 --> 00:20:05,220
Yeah, so am I, pal.

337
00:20:07,008 --> 00:20:08,860
Doc, could you give us a sec,
please?

338
00:20:08,905 --> 00:20:10,173
- Sure.
- Thanks.

339
00:20:13,007 --> 00:20:14,060
What's your name?

340
00:20:14,106 --> 00:20:15,320
Nick Monroe. What's yours?

341
00:20:15,358 --> 00:20:18,692
I'm special agent Sam Stiles.
This is my partner, Dean Murdock.

342
00:20:18,706 --> 00:20:21,122
- What office you from?
- Omaha,

343
00:20:21,157 --> 00:20:23,372
violent-crimes unit.
My S.A.C. sent me down here

344
00:20:23,407 --> 00:20:24,823
to see about the murders.

345
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,092
- You?
- D.C.

346
00:20:27,505 --> 00:20:29,390
Our assistant director
assigned us.

347
00:20:29,407 --> 00:20:31,840
- Which A.D.?
- Mike Kaiser.

348
00:20:31,908 --> 00:20:33,701
What are your badge numbers?

349
00:20:34,006 --> 00:20:36,072
- You're kidding, right?
- I'm just following protocol.

350
00:20:36,108 --> 00:20:37,621
Look, man, whatever.
Just

351
00:20:37,628 --> 00:20:39,640
call our A.D.
He'll sort things out, huh?

352
00:20:51,606 --> 00:20:54,181
Uh, yeah,
assistant director Kaiser, please.

353
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:59,391
Yeah, Sir, hello.
It's agent Nick Monroe.

354
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,582
I'm calling about...

355
00:21:01,806 --> 00:21:05,192
two of your men?
Stiles and Murdock?

356
00:21:05,507 --> 00:21:09,103
Uh, it seems that they've been
put on my case by mistake.

357
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:11,023
Are you questioning my authority?

358
00:21:11,058 --> 00:21:12,821
<i>No, no, no, Sir.
I'm not questioning.</i>

359
00:21:12,908 --> 00:21:14,601
You could have fooled me.

360
00:21:14,637 --> 00:21:17,612
Last time I checked, son,
D.C. has jurisdiction.

361
00:21:17,706 --> 00:21:18,992
<i>Or am I wrong?</i>

362
00:21:19,908 --> 00:21:20,821
<i>No, Sir.</i>

363
00:21:20,868 --> 00:21:21,960
Well, good.

364
00:21:22,508 --> 00:21:24,163
Well, the next time
you want to waste my time

365
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:26,802
with stupid questions, don't.

366
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:32,501
Those idjits.

367
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:39,381
Well, I'm sorry, guys.

368
00:21:39,415 --> 00:21:41,110
Just don't let it happen again.

369
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:42,790
So, where are you at with this?

370
00:21:42,807 --> 00:21:44,101
- Where are you at with this?
- Well,

371
00:21:44,145 --> 00:21:46,431
I was just about
to run the perps' blood work.

372
00:21:46,468 --> 00:21:48,100
I already checked.
It's a dead end.

373
00:21:50,406 --> 00:21:51,540
Well, get this.

374
00:21:51,546 --> 00:21:53,493
I feel like I found something
that

375
00:21:53,496 --> 00:21:55,030
connects all the murderers.

376
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:56,012
Really?

377
00:21:56,508 --> 00:21:58,521
They were all banging strippers

378
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:00,981
from the same club.

379
00:22:01,307 --> 00:22:02,651
You don't say.

380
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,201
What do you say

381
00:22:04,245 --> 00:22:06,070
we go down there and
check it out?

382
00:22:07,008 --> 00:22:09,051
Well, here's the thing, Nick.

383
00:22:09,105 --> 00:22:11,253
- See, we're kind of lone wolves...
- You know what?

384
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,991
That sounds like
an excellent idea.

385
00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:15,110
Just give me a second
with my partner. And we'll, uh...

386
00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:17,150
One second. Come here.

387
00:22:19,008 --> 00:22:20,640
Dude, you got to stay with him.

388
00:22:20,688 --> 00:22:22,910
- What?
- Keep him out of the way.

389
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,601
- Why me?
- 'Cause I got to get the blood samples.

390
00:22:26,007 --> 00:22:27,950
What the hell am I supposed
to do with him?

391
00:22:27,997 --> 00:22:29,431
Just take him to the strip club,

392
00:22:29,437 --> 00:22:31,162
keep an eye out
for the siren.

393
00:22:31,205 --> 00:22:32,323
Come on, Dean, just...

394
00:22:32,405 --> 00:22:34,983
Just focus on the naked girls.
You'll forget he's even there.

395
00:22:36,406 --> 00:22:38,461
I'm not doing this for you.
I'm doing it for the girls.

396
00:22:40,007 --> 00:22:42,413
We're taking my ride.
No complaining about the tunes.

397
00:22:43,007 --> 00:22:44,181
No way.

398
00:22:44,506 --> 00:22:45,741
- You drive an impala?
- Yeah.

399
00:22:45,808 --> 00:22:47,460
It's a '67, right?

400
00:22:47,506 --> 00:22:50,500
- It's a 3274-barrel.
- Yeah, actually.

401
00:22:50,607 --> 00:22:52,303
It's a thing of beauty.

402
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,140
- Thanks.
- How the hell did you talk the bureau

403
00:22:55,177 --> 00:22:57,082
into letting you drive
your own wheels?

404
00:22:58,205 --> 00:22:59,731
And you want this blood because...

405
00:22:59,765 --> 00:23:01,302
We'd like to run some tests.

406
00:23:03,905 --> 00:23:05,970
You know, I've run every test
there is. It's, um...

407
00:23:06,508 --> 00:23:07,560
my job.

408
00:23:07,606 --> 00:23:09,441
Notice the lab coat.

409
00:23:09,807 --> 00:23:12,612
We know a specialist who
would like to try out a theory.

410
00:23:14,007 --> 00:23:15,251
If you say so.

411
00:23:21,406 --> 00:23:22,892
What the hell?

412
00:23:23,508 --> 00:23:24,343
What?

413
00:23:24,907 --> 00:23:26,030
The blood's gone.

414
00:23:27,627 --> 00:23:28,900
- "Steal The World"
by Brian Tichy -

415
00:23:48,506 --> 00:23:50,181
"Nobody's fault but mine"

416
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:54,112
Oh, oh, oh,
Zeppelin recorded it, '75.

417
00:23:54,507 --> 00:23:56,831
It was a cover of
a Blind Willie Johnson tune.

418
00:23:57,008 --> 00:23:57,972
Nice.

419
00:23:58,507 --> 00:23:59,662
"You shook me"

420
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:02,901
Oh, '69, debut album,
written by Willie Dixon.

421
00:24:03,307 --> 00:24:04,252
And?

422
00:24:04,508 --> 00:24:06,721
- And what?
- Written by Willie Dixon

423
00:24:06,756 --> 00:24:08,412
and J.B. Lenoir.

424
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:10,913
Dude. Dude!

425
00:24:11,407 --> 00:24:13,603
You know, for a fed,
you're not a total dick.

426
00:24:14,006 --> 00:24:15,601
Aren't we both feds?

427
00:24:16,306 --> 00:24:18,223
Yeah. No, I just, you know,

428
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:20,503
not a lot of feds
as cool as us, huh?

429
00:24:22,405 --> 00:24:24,093
So, what the hell
with this case, man?

430
00:24:24,127 --> 00:24:26,693
How does a girl talk
four different Johns into murder?

431
00:24:27,406 --> 00:24:29,540
- Crazy world.
- I guess.

432
00:24:31,005 --> 00:24:32,312
Hey, can I level with you?

433
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:34,601
I found something kind of weird.

434
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,682
You brought your weird
to the right spot.

435
00:24:37,707 --> 00:24:38,752
Lay it on me.

436
00:24:38,766 --> 00:24:40,621
I went to the crime scene
this morning.

437
00:24:40,707 --> 00:24:42,302
Saw them bagging this up.

438
00:24:44,508 --> 00:24:46,940
So I went back through
all the files.

439
00:24:46,977 --> 00:24:49,802
It turns out a flower just like that
was found at every crime scene.

440
00:24:49,887 --> 00:24:51,313
Like it was left on purpose?

441
00:24:51,905 --> 00:24:53,613
I mean, you know,
sometimes a serial killer

442
00:24:53,615 --> 00:24:55,370
will leave an object behind,
like

443
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:57,470
a calling card.
But with this case?

444
00:24:57,906 --> 00:24:59,153
To tell you the truth...

445
00:25:00,405 --> 00:25:02,240
I got no idea what's going on.

446
00:25:05,007 --> 00:25:06,392
I think I might.

447
00:25:07,008 --> 00:25:08,842
I've seen
a flower like this before.

448
00:25:15,507 --> 00:25:18,080
We've watched them twice.
Whoever took the blood...

449
00:25:18,106 --> 00:25:19,912
Must have tampered
with the tapes.

450
00:25:22,007 --> 00:25:23,733
Who has access to your office?

451
00:25:23,808 --> 00:25:25,172
Everybody. I don't lock it.

452
00:25:25,207 --> 00:25:26,150
You what?

453
00:25:27,006 --> 00:25:29,241
I've never had
this problem before.

454
00:25:30,508 --> 00:25:32,633
What is so important
about the blood, anyway?

455
00:25:32,706 --> 00:25:34,220
I think someone
drugged the men,

456
00:25:34,227 --> 00:25:35,652
made them commit murder.

457
00:25:35,705 --> 00:25:36,793
What?

458
00:25:37,407 --> 00:25:38,781
What kind of drug?

459
00:25:39,308 --> 00:25:40,712
I'm not sure yet.

460
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:42,733
I don't know.

461
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:44,551
I mean, I interviewed
those guys,

462
00:25:44,557 --> 00:25:45,750
and they had their reasons.

463
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:47,513
Yeah, but they all loved their victims.

464
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:48,821
I'm sure they did.

465
00:25:51,306 --> 00:25:52,033
Come on.

466
00:25:52,505 --> 00:25:54,482
Haven't you ever been
in a relationship

467
00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:57,192
where you
really loved somebody and

468
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:59,490
still kind of wanted
to bash their head in?

469
00:26:00,507 --> 00:26:02,783
Sounds like you're speaking
from experience.

470
00:26:10,508 --> 00:26:12,252
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to pry.

471
00:26:12,295 --> 00:26:13,211
It's okay.

472
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,303
I was the one who brought it up.

473
00:26:22,008 --> 00:26:23,133
Really?

474
00:26:27,507 --> 00:26:28,740
It's medicine.

475
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:32,823
I'm a doctor.

476
00:26:43,408 --> 00:26:46,842
His name was Carl.

477
00:26:47,907 --> 00:26:49,192
And we were married.

478
00:26:52,008 --> 00:26:53,390
So what happened?

479
00:26:53,806 --> 00:26:55,132
Life happened.

480
00:26:57,005 --> 00:26:59,151
I don't know.
I mean, I loved him.

481
00:26:59,605 --> 00:27:01,513
I still do, I guess. But, um,

482
00:27:02,005 --> 00:27:04,362
I don't know. It's just like
one day I looked up, and I was

483
00:27:04,376 --> 00:27:06,812
living with a stranger. And...

484
00:27:10,008 --> 00:27:11,453
You know what I mean, right?

485
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:14,391
I guess or...

486
00:27:15,005 --> 00:27:16,551
I don't know. Maybe.

487
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:20,903
People change.

488
00:27:21,508 --> 00:27:22,952
God, I know I did.

489
00:27:25,007 --> 00:27:27,941
But it's nothing to
feel guilty about. It happens.

490
00:27:30,008 --> 00:27:31,540
So you two split up?

491
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,540
Yeah, I suppose
that's a word for it.

492
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:41,080
You need to get that?

493
00:27:46,408 --> 00:27:47,361
Not right now.

494
00:27:52,906 --> 00:27:53,752
Whatever.

495
00:27:54,908 --> 00:27:58,440
We've all got
our own sad stories, so...

496
00:28:00,507 --> 00:28:01,760
...screw it.

497
00:28:02,505 --> 00:28:04,600
Have fun, no regrets,

498
00:28:04,607 --> 00:28:07,672
and live life
like there's no tomorrow.

499
00:28:14,507 --> 00:28:16,361
For instance, I have

500
00:28:16,367 --> 00:28:18,473
been thinking about you

501
00:28:18,525 --> 00:28:19,932
all night.

502
00:28:23,587 --> 00:28:25,253
Parts of you.

503
00:28:25,308 --> 00:28:26,702
Just parts?

504
00:28:29,505 --> 00:28:31,061
Like your lips.

505
00:28:32,506 --> 00:28:35,150
They're very distracting.

506
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,981
It's a problem.

507
00:28:41,008 --> 00:28:43,082
And I can't stop thinking about

508
00:28:43,506 --> 00:28:44,882
kissing them.

509
00:28:45,508 --> 00:28:46,871
That so?

510
00:28:51,007 --> 00:28:52,030
So...

511
00:28:54,506 --> 00:28:55,880
...what the hell, huh?

512
00:29:41,306 --> 00:29:43,510
Sam, where the hell
have you been?

513
00:29:43,557 --> 00:29:44,361
<i>With Cara.</i>

514
00:29:44,405 --> 00:29:45,681
Oh, it's "Cara" now.

515
00:29:46,008 --> 00:29:47,563
<i>And you're not
picking up your phone.</i>

516
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:49,293
We were trying to find the blood samples.
Someone stole them.

517
00:29:49,405 --> 00:29:50,390
Yeah, I'll bet.

518
00:29:50,406 --> 00:29:51,513
What's that supposed to mean?

519
00:29:51,545 --> 00:29:53,843
<i>Nick found flower petals
at the crime scenes.</i>

520
00:29:53,885 --> 00:29:55,011
Hyacinths.

521
00:29:55,108 --> 00:29:56,502
- So?
<i>- Hyacinths?</i>

522
00:29:57,007 --> 00:29:59,131
Mediterranean, from the,
from the island where

523
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,971
<i>the whole freakin' siren myth
started in the first place?</i>

524
00:30:02,075 --> 00:30:04,720
Sam, Cara had hyacinth flowers.

525
00:30:05,706 --> 00:30:07,471
You think Cara's the siren?

526
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:09,053
<i>Well, I did
a little checking up on her.</i>

527
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:10,763
She's only been in town
for two months.

528
00:30:10,795 --> 00:30:13,010
- Yeah, and?
- And she has an ex-husband.

529
00:30:13,508 --> 00:30:15,840
A dead ex-husband,
Carl Roberts.

530
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:18,142
<i>Dropped like a stone,
no warning,</i>

531
00:30:18,146 --> 00:30:19,823
supposedly a heart attack.

532
00:30:19,908 --> 00:30:21,611
<i>Well, maybe
it was a heart attack.</i>

533
00:30:22,505 --> 00:30:23,351
You're kidding me.

534
00:30:23,395 --> 00:30:24,751
Look,
I just don't think it's her.

535
00:30:24,805 --> 00:30:26,330
<i>And what makes you so sure?</i>

536
00:30:26,405 --> 00:30:27,753
I don't know. A hunch.

537
00:30:27,797 --> 00:30:28,901
A hunch?

538
00:30:28,938 --> 00:30:31,453
I'm giving you cold, hard facts here,
and you're giving me a hunch?

539
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:35,421
Did you sleep with her?

540
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:40,821
Holy crap. You did.

541
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,170
Middle of "Basic Instinct"
and you bang Sharon Stone?

542
00:30:44,206 --> 00:30:45,913
<i>Sam, you could be
under her spell right now.</i>

543
00:30:45,947 --> 00:30:47,702
Dude, I'm not under her spell.

544
00:30:47,807 --> 00:30:49,663
Unbelievable, man.
I just don't get it.

545
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:50,523
<i>What?</i>

546
00:30:51,536 --> 00:30:52,483
Nothing.

547
00:30:52,507 --> 00:30:55,380
- No. Say it.
- No, it's just... First it's Madison,

548
00:30:55,405 --> 00:30:56,713
<i>and then Ruby, and now Cara.</i>

549
00:30:56,756 --> 00:30:58,560
It's like what is with you
and banging monsters?

550
00:30:58,596 --> 00:31:01,620
Look, Dean, I'm telling you.
It's not Cara. I feel fine.

551
00:31:01,707 --> 00:31:03,672
- I'll bet you do.
- You don't trust me.

552
00:31:03,705 --> 00:31:05,310
No because this could be
the siren talking.

553
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:06,372
Look, just tell me
where you are.

554
00:31:06,427 --> 00:31:08,680
I'll come meet you,
and we'll figure things out.

555
00:31:12,505 --> 00:31:14,181
- Are you serious?
<i>- I wish I weren't.</i>

556
00:31:14,198 --> 00:31:17,302
I got to handle this, Sam,
by myself.

557
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:31,551
Sam's in trouble, Bobby.

558
00:31:31,588 --> 00:31:33,550
I think the siren's worked
her mojo on him.

559
00:31:33,587 --> 00:31:34,963
Give me a call
as soon as you get this.

560
00:31:41,905 --> 00:31:43,091
Hey, man. What's up?

561
00:31:43,386 --> 00:31:44,591
I need your help.

562
00:31:45,306 --> 00:31:46,593
Uh, sure. With what?

563
00:31:46,606 --> 00:31:48,752
Canvassing.
We got to find somebody.

564
00:32:17,605 --> 00:32:19,293
She went in just a second ago.

565
00:32:19,335 --> 00:32:20,312
Nice work.

566
00:32:20,348 --> 00:32:21,613
Should we follow her in?

567
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,553
No, no, no,
I don't wanna tip her off.

568
00:32:23,585 --> 00:32:25,400
I'm just waiting to see
who she comes out with.

569
00:32:26,308 --> 00:32:27,280
So you think,

570
00:32:28,205 --> 00:32:29,022
what...

571
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:30,803
She's drugging these guys?

572
00:32:31,907 --> 00:32:32,791
Pretty much.

573
00:32:36,508 --> 00:32:38,881
- I know how it sounds.
- Are you sure about that?

574
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:40,823
'Cause it sounds
like crazy on toast.

575
00:32:40,905 --> 00:32:42,831
All these different strippers,

576
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:44,332
they're magically the same girl.

577
00:32:44,378 --> 00:32:45,821
but then they're not strippers
at all,

578
00:32:45,856 --> 00:32:48,220
- it's Dr. Quinn?
- It's kind of hard to explain,

579
00:32:48,307 --> 00:32:49,770
but I have my reasons,
and they're good ones.

580
00:32:49,817 --> 00:32:51,530
So you're just gonna have
to trust me on it.

581
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:56,690
I guess.

582
00:32:59,006 --> 00:33:00,140
Thank you.

583
00:33:00,508 --> 00:33:01,990
That's actually nice to hear.

584
00:33:13,506 --> 00:33:15,661
So, let's say
she is drugging her vics.

585
00:33:17,008 --> 00:33:18,580
How's she pulling that off?

586
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:19,953
She could be injecting them,

587
00:33:20,408 --> 00:33:22,281
you know, or
passing the toxin through

588
00:33:22,286 --> 00:33:23,561
physical contact.

589
00:33:24,507 --> 00:33:27,223
Or it could be her saliva.

590
00:33:31,907 --> 00:33:34,933
You really should have
wiped the lip of that thing

591
00:33:34,935 --> 00:33:36,861
before you drank from it, Dean.

592
00:33:41,505 --> 00:33:43,623
I should be your little brother.

593
00:33:45,605 --> 00:33:46,862
Sam...

594
00:33:49,305 --> 00:33:50,981
...you can't trust him.

595
00:33:52,007 --> 00:33:53,933
Not like you can trust me.

596
00:34:00,407 --> 00:34:01,672
In fact,

597
00:34:01,677 --> 00:34:05,372
I really feel like you should
get him out of the way

598
00:34:05,825 --> 00:34:08,372
so that we can be brothers...

599
00:34:09,905 --> 00:34:11,013
Forever.

600
00:34:20,506 --> 00:34:21,781
Yeah, you're right.

601
00:34:30,507 --> 00:34:31,380
{\a6}Nick,

602
00:34:31,818 --> 00:34:33,011
{\a6}what are you doing here?

603
00:34:41,505 --> 00:34:44,301
{\a6}I got to tell you,
you're one butt-ugly stripper.

604
00:34:44,338 --> 00:34:45,570
{\a6}Well, maybe.

605
00:34:45,606 --> 00:34:48,131
But I got exactly what I wanted.
I got Dean.

606
00:34:48,178 --> 00:34:51,041
Come on, man. This isn't you.
You can fight this.

607
00:34:51,105 --> 00:34:52,282
Let me go.

608
00:34:52,797 --> 00:34:54,381
Why don't you

609
00:34:54,395 --> 00:34:57,720
cut him just a little
on his neck right there?

610
00:35:01,286 --> 00:35:02,332
Dean's all mine.

611
00:35:02,407 --> 00:35:03,351
You poisoned him.

612
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:05,083
No, I gave him what he needed.

613
00:35:05,157 --> 00:35:07,352
And it wasn't some bitch
in a g-string.

614
00:35:08,387 --> 00:35:09,382
It was you.

615
00:35:10,048 --> 00:35:11,863
A little brother
that looked up to him,

616
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:13,640
that he could trust.

617
00:35:14,476 --> 00:35:15,743
And now he loves me.

618
00:35:18,037 --> 00:35:19,653
He'd do anything for me.

619
00:35:19,715 --> 00:35:21,371
And I got to tell you, Sam,

620
00:35:21,465 --> 00:35:23,310
that kind of devotion,

621
00:35:23,376 --> 00:35:26,790
watching someone kill for you...

622
00:35:28,536 --> 00:35:30,422
...is the best feeling in the world.

623
00:35:30,426 --> 00:35:32,340
Is that why
you're slutting all over town?

624
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,041
I get bored.

625
00:35:37,448 --> 00:35:39,100
Like we all do.

626
00:35:39,527 --> 00:35:41,540
And I want to fall in love again.

627
00:35:42,585 --> 00:35:45,131
And again and again.

628
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:47,233
Tell you what, I have fought
some nasty sons of bitches,

629
00:35:47,307 --> 00:35:49,620
but you are one

630
00:35:49,627 --> 00:35:52,733
needy, pathetic loser.

631
00:35:52,795 --> 00:35:54,403
You won't feel that way
in a minute.

632
00:36:13,575 --> 00:36:14,783
So, I know you two

633
00:36:14,865 --> 00:36:16,971
have a lot you want
to get off your chests.

634
00:36:17,037 --> 00:36:19,882
So why don't you discuss it...

635
00:36:20,606 --> 00:36:24,791
and whoever survives
can be with me forever?

636
00:36:31,016 --> 00:36:32,741
Well, I don't know
when it happened.

637
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,442
Maybe when I was in hell.

638
00:36:35,687 --> 00:36:37,801
Maybe when I was staring
right at you.

639
00:36:39,095 --> 00:36:41,121
But the Sam I knew,
he's gone.

640
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:43,640
- That so?
- And it's not the demon blood

641
00:36:43,687 --> 00:36:45,402
or the psychic crap.

642
00:36:46,165 --> 00:36:47,713
It's the little stuff.

643
00:36:48,325 --> 00:36:51,010
The lies, the secrets.

644
00:36:51,867 --> 00:36:52,893
What secrets?

645
00:36:52,926 --> 00:36:54,063
Phone calls to Ruby, for one.

646
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,000
So I need your say-so
to make a phone call?

647
00:36:56,096 --> 00:36:57,532
That's the point.

648
00:36:58,397 --> 00:37:00,113
You're hiding things from me.

649
00:37:00,127 --> 00:37:01,881
What else aren't you telling me?

650
00:37:03,065 --> 00:37:04,463
None of your business.

651
00:37:05,046 --> 00:37:06,423
See what I mean?

652
00:37:07,577 --> 00:37:09,891
We used to be in this together.

653
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:11,711
We used to have each other's backs!

654
00:37:11,848 --> 00:37:13,082
Okay, fine.
You want to know why

655
00:37:13,127 --> 00:37:14,563
I didn't tell you about Ruby?

656
00:37:15,075 --> 00:37:17,210
And how
we're hunting down Lilith?

657
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:20,001
Because you're too weak
to go after her, Dean.

658
00:37:20,016 --> 00:37:21,923
You're holding me back.

659
00:37:22,396 --> 00:37:24,402
I'm a better hunter than you are.

660
00:37:24,437 --> 00:37:26,363
Stronger, smarter.

661
00:37:26,756 --> 00:37:29,272
I can take out demons
you're too scared to go near.

662
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:30,823
- That's crap.
- You're too busy sitting around

663
00:37:30,846 --> 00:37:32,492
feeling sorry for yourself,

664
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:35,530
whining about all the souls
you tortured in hell.

665
00:37:51,257 --> 00:37:53,013
You're not standing in my way

666
00:37:53,028 --> 00:37:54,411
anymore.

667
00:38:26,057 --> 00:38:26,770
Do it.

668
00:38:29,647 --> 00:38:31,201
Do it for me, Dean.

669
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:40,833
Tell me again
how weak I am, Sam, huh?

670
00:38:41,045 --> 00:38:42,642
How I hold you back.

671
00:39:38,018 --> 00:39:38,893
{\a6}Thanks.

672
00:39:40,427 --> 00:39:41,340
{\a6}Soda?

673
00:39:41,827 --> 00:39:43,412
{\a6}You boys are driving, ain't ya?

674
00:39:51,428 --> 00:39:52,892
Thanks, Bobby.
You know, you...

675
00:39:53,485 --> 00:39:55,200
You hadn't shown up
when you did...

676
00:39:55,256 --> 00:39:57,693
Done the same for me,
more than once.

677
00:39:58,965 --> 00:40:00,770
Of course, you could have
picked up a phone.

678
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,820
Only took one call
to figure out that

679
00:40:02,846 --> 00:40:05,631
agent Nick Monroe
wasn't real.

680
00:40:13,455 --> 00:40:14,853
You boys gonna be okay?

681
00:40:15,255 --> 00:40:16,812
- Yeah, fine.
- Yeah, good.

682
00:40:19,028 --> 00:40:20,010
See you!

683
00:40:25,817 --> 00:40:28,600
You know,
those sirens are nasty things.

684
00:40:29,457 --> 00:40:30,781
That it got to you,

685
00:40:31,278 --> 00:40:33,090
that's no reason to feel bad.

686
00:40:46,705 --> 00:40:48,292
You gonna say goodbye to Cara?

687
00:40:51,017 --> 00:40:52,122
Not interested.

688
00:40:54,037 --> 00:40:55,083
Really? Why not?

689
00:40:57,435 --> 00:40:58,571
What's the point?

690
00:41:00,548 --> 00:41:02,440
Well, look at you.
Love 'em and leave 'em.

691
00:41:06,575 --> 00:41:08,131
Dean, look,
you know I didn't mean

692
00:41:08,228 --> 00:41:09,541
the things
I said back there, right?

693
00:41:09,627 --> 00:41:11,480
That it was just
the siren's spell talking?

694
00:41:11,538 --> 00:41:12,603
Of course. Me too.

695
00:41:14,516 --> 00:41:15,361
So...

696
00:41:15,628 --> 00:41:16,892
So we're good?

697
00:41:18,528 --> 00:41:19,930
Yeah, we're good.
