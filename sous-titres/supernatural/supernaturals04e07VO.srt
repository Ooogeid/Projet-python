1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,669
You know how I feel
about Halloween?

2
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,569
- Who are you?
- Castiel.

3
00:00:24,729 --> 00:00:26,815
- I mean what are you?
- I'm an angel of the lord.

4
00:00:26,935 --> 00:00:30,241
The rising of the witnesses
is one of the 66 seals.

5
00:00:30,888 --> 00:00:34,287
Those seals are being
broken by lilith.

6
00:00:34,447 --> 00:00:36,998
- Last one opens and...
- Lucifer walks free.

7
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:38,359
So, you been using your,

8
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,834
- freaky E.S.P. stuff?
- No.

9
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:42,045
Yeah, well, let's keep it that way.

10
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:44,261
- I'm just exorcising demons.
- with your mind!

11
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:45,731
I can send them back to hell.

12
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:48,001
- But try to see the other side here.
- The other side?!

13
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:50,178
I'm pulling demons
out of innocent people.

14
00:00:50,338 --> 00:00:52,568
- Use the knife!
- The knife kills the victim.

15
00:00:52,688 --> 00:00:54,349
What I do, most of them survive!

16
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:56,893
You should show me some respect.

17
00:00:57,135 --> 00:00:58,812
I dragged you out of hell.

18
00:00:59,188 --> 00:01:00,730
I can throw you back in.

19
00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:27,814
- How was the store?
- Oh, madness.

20
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,076
Everyone in town was stocking up.

21
00:01:31,394 --> 00:01:33,370
Did, uh, you get enough?

22
00:01:34,602 --> 00:01:37,174
I had to arm-wrestle
norma bleaker for these.

23
00:01:37,294 --> 00:01:38,309
Honey, she's 74.

24
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:40,403
And a lot stronger than she looks.

25
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,758
Remember last year?
We ran out at 6:30.

26
00:01:44,878 --> 00:01:46,258
It's just one piece.

27
00:01:46,378 --> 00:01:48,633
You can have as much as you want...

28
00:01:48,753 --> 00:01:50,113
After halloween.

29
00:01:51,252 --> 00:01:52,252
No.

30
00:01:52,817 --> 00:01:54,367
Oh, who needs a bath?

31
00:01:57,421 --> 00:01:59,825
Oh, there we go!

32
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,815
- You coming?
- I'll, uh, i'll be up in a minute.

33
00:02:02,935 --> 00:02:03,935
Okay.

34
00:03:07,761 --> 00:03:09,897
Luke, what's taking you so long?

35
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,123
Oh, my god!

36
00:03:19,153 --> 00:03:21,232
Synchro VO: IceFre@k

37
00:03:26,377 --> 00:03:28,831
Now, how many razor
blades did they find?

38
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:33,883
Two on the floor,
one in his stomach, and...

39
00:03:34,384 --> 00:03:35,969
one was stuck in his throat.

40
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:39,569
He swallowed four of them.

41
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:41,391
How is that even possible?

42
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:48,106
The candy was never in the oven.

43
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:53,152
We just have to be thorough, mrs.
Wallace.

44
00:03:53,312 --> 00:03:55,450
Did the police find any
razors in the rest of the candy?

45
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,263
No.
I mean, I don't know.

46
00:03:57,383 --> 00:03:58,383
I don't think so.

47
00:03:59,986 --> 00:04:00,910
I just...

48
00:04:02,883 --> 00:04:04,383
I can't believe it.

49
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:09,669
You hear urban legends about this stuff,
but it actually happens?

50
00:04:10,036 --> 00:04:12,151
More than you might imagine.

51
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:21,514
Mrs. Wallace,
did luke have any enemies?

52
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:22,974
Enemies?

53
00:04:23,134 --> 00:04:25,143
Anyone who might have
held a grudge against him?

54
00:04:25,303 --> 00:04:27,270
- What do you mean?
- Co-workers.

55
00:04:27,686 --> 00:04:28,688
Neighbors.

56
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,942
Maybe a woman.

57
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:36,779
Are you suggesting an affair?

58
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,822
- Is it possible?
- No!

59
00:04:39,264 --> 00:04:40,783
No, luke would nev--

60
00:04:40,943 --> 00:04:41,906
I'm very sorry.

61
00:04:42,026 --> 00:04:44,091
We just have to consider
all possibilities.

62
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,665
If someone wanted
to kill my husband,

63
00:04:48,472 --> 00:04:50,697
don't you think they'd find
a better way than a razor

64
00:04:50,817 --> 00:04:53,296
in a piece of candy he might eat?

65
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:09,510
Really?

66
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,139
After that guy choked
down all those razor blades?

67
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:13,456
It's halloween, man.

68
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:14,828
Yeah.

69
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,734
For us, every day is halloween.

70
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:19,416
Don't be a downer.
Anything interesting?

71
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:21,407
We're on a witch-hunt,
that's for sure.

72
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:24,016
But this isn't your typical hex bag.

73
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:25,328
No?

74
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:29,016
Goldthread... An herb that's
been extinct for 200 years.

75
00:05:29,136 --> 00:05:32,585
And this is celtic,
and I don't mean some new age knock-off.

76
00:05:32,745 --> 00:05:34,309
Looks like the real deal.
Like...

77
00:05:34,676 --> 00:05:36,315
600-years-old real.

78
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:37,567
And, uh...

79
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,779
That is the charred metacarpal
bone of a newborn baby.

80
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:43,478
Oh, gross.

81
00:05:43,598 --> 00:05:46,018
Relax, man.
It's, like, at least 100 years old.

82
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:47,767
Oh, right,
like that makes it better?

83
00:05:47,887 --> 00:05:49,769
Witches, man.
They're so freaking skeevy.

84
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:52,971
Well, it takes a pretty powerful
one to put a bag like this together.

85
00:05:53,091 --> 00:05:55,400
More juice than we've ever
dealt with before, that's for sure.

86
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,412
What about you...
Find anything on the victim?

87
00:05:57,532 --> 00:05:58,703
This luke wallace --

88
00:05:58,823 --> 00:06:01,280
He was so vanilla that
he made vanilla seem spicy.

89
00:06:03,193 --> 00:06:06,064
I can't find any reason why
somebody would want this guy dead.

90
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:16,494
This party blows.

91
00:06:17,616 --> 00:06:19,340
We should just go t. P. Somebody.

92
00:06:22,186 --> 00:06:23,793
- Uh, hey, justin.
- Yo.

93
00:06:23,913 --> 00:06:25,388
You break into the booze yet?

94
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:27,836
Uh, it's triple-locked.

95
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,644
So, you guys going to the
mausoleum party tomorrow night?

96
00:06:31,804 --> 00:06:33,146
Are you gonna be there?

97
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:36,227
It's gonna be rad.
I'm gonna get so baked.

98
00:06:37,485 --> 00:06:40,236
Well, it's got to be better
than this g-rated assfest.

99
00:06:40,396 --> 00:06:41,988
Oh, come on, it's not that bad.

100
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:45,040
Oh, check it out.

101
00:06:46,302 --> 00:06:48,327
Okay, bobbing for apples is lame.

102
00:06:48,447 --> 00:06:49,912
Oh, come on, it's halloween.

103
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:51,372
Uh... lame.

104
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,011
I stand corrected.

105
00:07:06,992 --> 00:07:08,598
Well, I want to try.

106
00:07:31,737 --> 00:07:33,206
She can really hold her breath.

107
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:41,539
Jenny?

108
00:07:44,313 --> 00:07:45,134
Help me!

109
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,553
Jenny, what's wrong?

110
00:07:47,713 --> 00:07:48,554
Help!

111
00:07:49,757 --> 00:07:51,030
Come on, let's go!

112
00:07:57,824 --> 00:07:58,856
What is happening?

113
00:07:59,016 --> 00:08:00,274
Jenny, come on!

114
00:08:08,463 --> 00:08:09,575
Help! Jenny!

115
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:21,232
Oh, my god.

116
00:08:34,285 --> 00:08:35,285
Yes.

117
00:08:36,252 --> 00:08:37,564
I got this one.

118
00:08:38,388 --> 00:08:40,166
Two words... Jail bait.

119
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:42,034
I would never.

120
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:47,113
You know, it's just so weird.

121
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,952
I mean, the water in the tub...
It wasn't hot.

122
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,909
I had just been in there myself.

123
00:08:52,069 --> 00:08:54,370
You friend didn't happen
to know a man named luke wallace?

124
00:08:55,913 --> 00:08:57,373
Agent seger... FBI.

125
00:08:58,784 --> 00:09:00,459
Um, who's luke wallace?

126
00:09:02,261 --> 00:09:03,504
He died yesterday.

127
00:09:04,307 --> 00:09:05,590
I don't know who that is.

128
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:23,399
I'm telling you,
both of these vics are squeaky-clean.

129
00:09:23,571 --> 00:09:25,776
There was no reason
for wicked-bitch payback.

130
00:09:25,936 --> 00:09:27,681
Maybe 'cause it's not about that.

131
00:09:28,346 --> 00:09:29,326
Wow. Insightful.

132
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:31,701
Maybe this witch
isn't working a grudge.

133
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,890
Maybe they're working a spell.
Check this out.

134
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,322
"Three blood sacrifices
over three days...

135
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:40,364
The last before midnight on
the final day of the final harvest."

136
00:09:41,576 --> 00:09:44,295
Celtic calendar... The final day
of the final harvest

137
00:09:44,455 --> 00:09:45,713
is october 31st.

138
00:09:45,873 --> 00:09:47,539
- Halloween?
- Exactly.

139
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,996
What exactly are the,
uh, blood sacrifices for?

140
00:09:51,116 --> 00:09:53,387
Uh, if I'm right,
this witch is summoning a demon.

141
00:09:53,547 --> 00:09:55,009
And not just any demon --

142
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:56,638
Samhain.

143
00:09:57,134 --> 00:09:58,516
Am I supposed to be impressed?

144
00:09:58,636 --> 00:10:01,437
Dean, samhain is the
damn origin of halloween.

145
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,232
The celts believed that october 31st
was the one night of

146
00:10:04,392 --> 00:10:06,943
the year when the veil was thinnest
between the living and the dead.

147
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:09,946
And it was samhain's night.
Masks were put on to hide from him,

148
00:10:10,106 --> 00:10:12,073
sweets left on doorsteps
to appease him,

149
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:14,283
faces carved into pumpkins
to worship him.

150
00:10:14,443 --> 00:10:16,267
He was exorcised centuries ago.

151
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:19,163
So even though samhain took
a trip downstairs, the tradition stuck.

152
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:20,122
Exactly.

153
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,459
Only now, instead of demons
and blood orgies, halloween is all about

154
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:25,211
kids, candy, and costumes.

155
00:10:25,821 --> 00:10:28,714
Okay, so some witch wants to
raise samhain and take back the night?

156
00:10:28,874 --> 00:10:30,675
- Dean, this is serious.
- I am serious.

157
00:10:30,835 --> 00:10:32,446
We're talking
heavyweight witchcraft.

158
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:35,137
This ritual can only
be performed every 600 years.

159
00:10:35,476 --> 00:10:37,181
And the 600-year
marker rolls around...

160
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:39,058
- Tomorrow night.
- Naturally.

161
00:10:39,218 --> 00:10:41,377
It sure is a lot of death
and destruction for one demon.

162
00:10:41,497 --> 00:10:43,813
That's 'cause he likes company.
Once he's raised, Samhain 

163
00:10:43,973 --> 00:10:46,649
- can do some raising of his own.
- Raising what, exactly?

164
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:48,734
Dark, evil crap and lots of it.

165
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:51,028
They follow him around
like the friggin' pied piper.

166
00:10:51,188 --> 00:10:52,655
So we're talking ghosts.

167
00:10:52,815 --> 00:10:53,835
Zombies?

168
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:55,116
- Leprechauns?
- Dean.

169
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:57,264
Those little dudes are scary.
Small hands.

170
00:10:58,952 --> 00:11:00,663
It just starts with
ghosts and ghouls.

171
00:11:00,823 --> 00:11:04,000
This sucker keeps on going, by night's
end, we are talking every awful

172
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,541
thing we've ever seen,
everything we fight

173
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,045
all in one place.

174
00:11:10,892 --> 00:11:12,508
It's gonna be a slaughterhouse.

175
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:35,855
How's it going?

176
00:11:35,975 --> 00:11:36,750
<i>Awesome.</i>

177
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,701
<i>Yeah, I talked with mrs.
Razor blade again.</i>

178
00:11:38,861 --> 00:11:40,971
I've been sitting out
in front of her house for hours,

179
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:42,913
and I've got a big,
steamy pile of nothing.

180
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:46,420
Someone planted those hex bags,
someone with access to both houses.

181
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,202
- There's got to be some connection.
<i>- Yeah, well, I hope we find him soon</i>

182
00:11:49,322 --> 00:11:52,506
'cause I'm starting to cramp like a...
Son of a bitch.

183
00:11:53,751 --> 00:11:54,675
Quit whining.

184
00:11:55,729 --> 00:11:57,904
No, sam, I mean "son of a bitch."

185
00:12:05,602 --> 00:12:06,621
So?

186
00:12:06,741 --> 00:12:08,433
Our apple-bobbing cheerleader?

187
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:09,556
Tracy?

188
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:11,308
The wallaces' babysitter.

189
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:13,638
She told me she'd never
even heard of luke wallace.

190
00:12:15,715 --> 00:12:17,573
Interesting look for
a centuries-old witch.

191
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:19,767
If you were a 600-year-old hag

192
00:12:19,887 --> 00:12:22,122
and you could pick any costume
to come back in,

193
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,871
wouldn't you go
for a hot cheerleader?

194
00:12:25,303 --> 00:12:26,248
I would.

195
00:12:35,752 --> 00:12:38,052
Well, tracy's not as
wholesome as she looks.

196
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:39,748
Did some digging.

197
00:12:39,868 --> 00:12:43,192
Apparently, she got into a violent
altercation with one of her teachers.

198
00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:44,683
Got suspended from school.

199
00:13:04,172 --> 00:13:05,287
Bring back memories?

200
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:07,617
What do you mean?

201
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,152
Being a teenager, all that angst.

202
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,430
Oh.

203
00:13:12,486 --> 00:13:13,935
What'd you think I meant?

204
00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:15,128
Nothing.

205
00:13:19,795 --> 00:13:21,429
Now, that brings back memories.

206
00:13:22,111 --> 00:13:24,473
Dude, I need a bigger kiln.

207
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:26,999
You gentlemen wanted to talk to me?

208
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:28,373
Ah, Mr. Harding.

209
00:13:28,493 --> 00:13:29,840
Oh, please. Don.

210
00:13:30,436 --> 00:13:32,748
- Okay, don.
- Even my students call me don.

211
00:13:32,868 --> 00:13:34,125
Yeah, we get it, don.

212
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:37,027
Uh, I'm agent geddy.
This is agent lee.

213
00:13:37,187 --> 00:13:39,571
We just had a few questions about,
uh, tracy davis.

214
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:40,906
Uh, yeah, tracy.

215
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:43,186
Uh, bright kid, loads of talent.

216
00:13:43,306 --> 00:13:44,726
It's a shame she got suspended.

217
00:13:44,846 --> 00:13:47,496
You two had a,
uh, violent altercation.

218
00:13:47,816 --> 00:13:49,436
Yeah, she exploded.

219
00:13:49,556 --> 00:13:51,740
Uh, if principal murrow
hadn't walked by when he did,

220
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,998
- Tacy would have clawed my eyes out.
- Why?

221
00:13:54,118 --> 00:13:56,748
You know, I was only trying
to rap with her about her work.

222
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:59,508
It had gotten inappropriate
and disturbing.

223
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,303
More disturbing than --

224
00:14:02,614 --> 00:14:04,138
Than, uh, those guys?

225
00:14:06,056 --> 00:14:09,852
She would cover page after page
with these bizarre cryptic symbols.

226
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,271
And then there were the drawings...

227
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:14,523
Detailed images of killings,

228
00:14:14,912 --> 00:14:16,939
gory, primitive.

229
00:14:17,604 --> 00:14:21,061
She would depict herself in
the middle of them, participating.

230
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:25,284
Symbols?
What kind of symbols?

231
00:14:25,575 --> 00:14:27,077
Uh, anything like this?

232
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,165
Yeah. Yeah, I think that
might have been one of them.

233
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:34,210
- You know where tracy is now?
- I would imagine her apartment.

234
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,937
- Her apartment?
- Yeah.

235
00:14:36,057 --> 00:14:38,203
She got here about a year ago alone,

236
00:14:38,323 --> 00:14:40,674
as I understood it,
as an emancipated teen.

237
00:14:41,342 --> 00:14:43,135
God only knows what
her parents were like.

238
00:14:52,618 --> 00:14:53,438
So?

239
00:14:53,558 --> 00:14:56,482
Tracy was nowhere I could find.
Any luck with her friends?

240
00:14:56,642 --> 00:14:58,814
Luck is not our style.
Friends don't know where she is.

241
00:14:58,934 --> 00:15:00,461
It's like the bitch hopped a broom.

242
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:02,567
She could be making the
third sacrifice any time.

243
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:03,977
Yes, thank you, sam.

244
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:06,909
Trick or treat.

245
00:15:07,185 --> 00:15:08,285
This is a motel.

246
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:09,370
So?

247
00:15:10,146 --> 00:15:11,497
So we don't have any candy.

248
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:14,093
- No, we have a ton in the, uh --
- We did, but it's gone.

249
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:18,212
Sorry, kid, we can't help you.

250
00:15:18,646 --> 00:15:19,797
I want candy.

251
00:15:20,206 --> 00:15:21,674
Well, I think you've had enough.

252
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,561
Who are you?!

253
00:15:34,888 --> 00:15:36,190
Sam, sam, wait!

254
00:15:37,242 --> 00:15:38,232
It's castiel...

255
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:40,311
The angel.

256
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:43,412
Him, I don't know.

257
00:15:45,975 --> 00:15:46,999
Hello, sam.

258
00:15:47,802 --> 00:15:48,935
Oh, my god.

259
00:15:49,253 --> 00:15:50,753
Er, uh, I didn't mean to --

260
00:15:50,873 --> 00:15:51,873
Sorry.

261
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,060
It's an honor.

262
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,241
Really,
I-I've heard a lot about you.

263
00:16:02,082 --> 00:16:03,122
And i, you.

264
00:16:04,849 --> 00:16:06,051
Sam winchester --

265
00:16:07,323 --> 00:16:08,762
The boy with the demon blood.

266
00:16:10,243 --> 00:16:13,919
Glad to hear you've ceased
your extracurricular activities.

267
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:15,603
Let's keep it that way.

268
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:17,666
Yeah, okay, chuckles.

269
00:16:17,786 --> 00:16:19,753
- Who's your friend?
- This raising of samhain --

270
00:16:19,873 --> 00:16:21,004
Have you stopped it?

271
00:16:21,124 --> 00:16:21,817
Why?

272
00:16:21,937 --> 00:16:23,566
Dean, have you located the witch?

273
00:16:23,686 --> 00:16:26,113
- Yes, we've located the witch.
- And is the witch dead?

274
00:16:26,273 --> 00:16:27,906
- No, but...
- We know who it is.

275
00:16:28,368 --> 00:16:31,020
Apparently,
the witch knows who you are, too.

276
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,914
This was inside
the wall of your room.

277
00:16:36,523 --> 00:16:39,126
If we hadn't found it,
surely one or both of you would be dead.

278
00:16:39,453 --> 00:16:41,318
Do you know where the witch is now?

279
00:16:44,122 --> 00:16:46,180
- We're working on it.
- That's unfortunate.

280
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,052
What do you care?

281
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,005
The raising of samhain
is one of the 66 seals.

282
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:53,880
So this is about your buddy lucifer.

283
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,068
Lucifer is no friend of ours.

284
00:16:58,005 --> 00:16:59,229
It's just an expression.

285
00:16:59,743 --> 00:17:01,565
Lucifer cannot rise.

286
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,402
The breaking of the seal
must be prevented at all costs.

287
00:17:07,373 --> 00:17:10,282
Okay. Great. Now that you're here, why
don't you tell us where the witch is?

288
00:17:10,442 --> 00:17:13,369
- We'll gank her, everybody goes home.
- We are not omniscient.

289
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:16,455
This witch is very powerful.
She's cloaked, even to our methods.

290
00:17:16,615 --> 00:17:18,694
Okay, well,
we already know who she is.

291
00:17:18,814 --> 00:17:20,668
- So, if we work together --
- Enough of this.

292
00:17:20,828 --> 00:17:23,016
Who are you, and why should I care?

293
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:25,907
This is uriel.

294
00:17:26,543 --> 00:17:28,202
He's what you might call...

295
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:30,260
A specialist.

296
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:34,530
What kind of a specialist?

297
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:41,484
What are you gonna do?

298
00:17:41,752 --> 00:17:44,942
You -- both of you,
you need to leave this town immediately.

299
00:17:45,686 --> 00:17:46,695
Why?

300
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,567
Because we're about to destroy it.

301
00:17:52,818 --> 00:17:55,327
So this is your plan, you're
gonna smack the whole freakin' town.

302
00:17:55,487 --> 00:17:56,615
We're out of time.

303
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,991
This witch has to die.

304
00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:59,665
The seal must be saved.

305
00:17:59,825 --> 00:18:02,788
- There are a thousand people here.
- 1,214.

306
00:18:03,007 --> 00:18:04,628
And you're willing to kill them all?

307
00:18:04,788 --> 00:18:06,603
This isn't the first time I've...

308
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,162
Purified a city.

309
00:18:08,817 --> 00:18:12,052
Look, I understand
this is regrettable.

310
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,680
- Regrettable?
- We have to hold the line.

311
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,454
Too many seals have broken already.

312
00:18:16,574 --> 00:18:19,393
So you screwed the pooch on some seals,
and now this town has to pay the price?

313
00:18:19,553 --> 00:18:22,730
It's the lives of 1,000
against the lives of 6 billion.

314
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,056
- There's a bigger picture here.
- Right...

315
00:18:25,176 --> 00:18:27,192
'cause, uh,
you're bigger-picture kind of guys.

316
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:30,689
Lucifer cannot rise.

317
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:33,132
He does, and hell rises with him.

318
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,510
Is that something that
you're willing to risk?

319
00:18:37,235 --> 00:18:39,558
We'll stop this witch
before she summons anyone.

320
00:18:39,678 --> 00:18:41,999
Your seal won't be broken,
and no one has to die.

321
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:44,918
We're wasting time
with these mud monkeys.

322
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:47,925
I'm sorry.

323
00:18:48,777 --> 00:18:50,883
- But we have our orders.
- No, you can't do this.

324
00:18:51,043 --> 00:18:52,426
You -- you're angels.

325
00:18:52,586 --> 00:18:55,763
I mean, aren't you supposed to --
You're supposed to show mercy.

326
00:18:55,923 --> 00:18:57,014
Says who?

327
00:18:57,621 --> 00:18:58,682
We have no choice.

328
00:18:58,842 --> 00:19:00,225
Of course you have a choice.

329
00:19:00,385 --> 00:19:03,296
I mean, come on, what, you've never...
Never questioned a crap order?

330
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,216
What are you both,
just a couple of hammers?

331
00:19:05,336 --> 00:19:07,729
Look, even if you
can't understand it,

332
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:10,486
have faith the plan is just.

333
00:19:10,646 --> 00:19:13,030
- How can you even say that?
- Because it comes from heaven.

334
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:14,948
That makes it just.

335
00:19:15,735 --> 00:19:17,235
It must be nice

336
00:19:17,778 --> 00:19:19,203
to be so sure of yourselves.

337
00:19:20,086 --> 00:19:21,163
Tell me something.

338
00:19:21,507 --> 00:19:25,292
When your father gave you an order,
didn't you obey?

339
00:19:28,928 --> 00:19:31,089
Sorry, boys,
it looks like the plans have changed.

340
00:19:32,682 --> 00:19:34,510
You think you can stop us?

341
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:36,096
No.

342
00:19:37,304 --> 00:19:39,748
But if you're gonna
smite this whole town...

343
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,019
Then you're gonna have to smite
us with it because we are not leaving.

344
00:19:44,861 --> 00:19:47,022
You went to the trouble
of busting me out of hell.

345
00:19:47,182 --> 00:19:49,733
I figure I'm worth something
to the man upstairs.

346
00:19:52,481 --> 00:19:53,841
You want to waste me?

347
00:19:54,408 --> 00:19:55,490
Go ahead.

348
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,324
See how he digs that.

349
00:19:57,484 --> 00:19:59,868
I will drag you out of here myself.

350
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:03,205
Yeah, but you'll have to kill me.
Then we're back to the same problem.

351
00:20:04,576 --> 00:20:05,582
I mean, come on.

352
00:20:05,742 --> 00:20:08,867
You're gonna wipe out a
whole town for one little witch?

353
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:12,798
Sounds to me like you're
compensating for something.

354
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,868
We can do this.

355
00:20:20,866 --> 00:20:22,140
We will find that witch.

356
00:20:22,396 --> 00:20:23,976
We will stop the summoning.

357
00:20:25,743 --> 00:20:28,804
- Castiel, I will not let these --
- Enough.

358
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,484
I suggest you move quickly.

359
00:20:54,194 --> 00:20:55,555
Astronaut!

360
00:21:01,495 --> 00:21:02,495
What?

361
00:21:03,114 --> 00:21:04,114
Nothing.

362
00:21:07,713 --> 00:21:09,271
I thought they'd be different.

363
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:12,103
- Who, the angels?
- Yeah.

364
00:21:12,223 --> 00:21:13,875
Well, I tried to tell you.

365
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,120
I just --

366
00:21:16,494 --> 00:21:18,196
I mean, I thought
they'd be righteous.

367
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,812
Well, they are righteous.

368
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:23,666
I mean, that's kind of the problem.

369
00:21:24,212 --> 00:21:26,455
Of course, there's nothing
more dangerous than some a-hole

370
00:21:26,615 --> 00:21:28,248
who thinks he's on a holy mission.

371
00:21:32,496 --> 00:21:36,125
But, I mean, this is god and heaven?

372
00:21:36,245 --> 00:21:38,050
This is what I've been praying to?

373
00:21:38,406 --> 00:21:40,642
Look, man, I know you're into
the whole god thing

374
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,180
and jesus on a tortilla
and stuff like that.

375
00:21:44,675 --> 00:21:46,562
But just because there's
a couple of bad apples

376
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:48,569
doesn't mean the
whole barrel is rotten.

377
00:21:48,818 --> 00:21:51,939
I mean, for all we know,
god hates these jerks.

378
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:56,243
Don't give up on the
stuff is all I'm saying.

379
00:21:56,497 --> 00:21:58,862
Babe ruth was a dick,
but baseball's still a beautiful game.

380
00:22:04,236 --> 00:22:06,291
Are you gonna figure out
a way to find this witch,

381
00:22:06,411 --> 00:22:08,785
or are you just gonna sit there
fingering your bone?

382
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,751
You know how much heat it would
take to char a bone like this, dean?

383
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:14,267
No.

384
00:22:14,387 --> 00:22:15,064
A lot.

385
00:22:15,184 --> 00:22:17,884
I mean, more than a
fire or some kitchen oven.

386
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,650
Okay, betty crocker,
what does that mean?

387
00:22:22,311 --> 00:22:23,815
It means we make a stop.

388
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,064
So, tracy used a
kiln to char the bone?

389
00:22:37,184 --> 00:22:38,398
What's the big deal?

390
00:22:40,157 --> 00:22:43,067
That hex bag turned up in
our room not after we talked to tracy...

391
00:22:43,524 --> 00:22:45,422
After we talked to the teacher.

392
00:23:03,977 --> 00:23:04,842
Oh, my god.

393
00:23:04,962 --> 00:23:06,591
Those are all from children.

394
00:23:07,117 --> 00:23:09,099
I'm guessing he's not
saving them for the dog.

395
00:23:13,138 --> 00:23:14,747
The decision's been made.

396
00:23:15,313 --> 00:23:16,575
By a mud monkey.

397
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:19,065
You shouldn't call them that.

398
00:23:19,185 --> 00:23:20,566
Oh, That's what they are --

399
00:23:20,686 --> 00:23:24,031
Savages, just plumbing on two legs.

400
00:23:25,623 --> 00:23:27,224
You're close to blasphemy.

401
00:23:31,436 --> 00:23:33,189
There's a reason we
were sent to save him.

402
00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:35,542
He has potential.
He may succeed here.

403
00:23:39,576 --> 00:23:40,848
At any rate...

404
00:23:41,831 --> 00:23:43,391
It's out of our hands.

405
00:23:45,437 --> 00:23:46,636
It doesn't have to be.

406
00:23:47,603 --> 00:23:49,014
And what would you suggest?

407
00:23:49,174 --> 00:23:52,476
That we drag dean winchester
out of here,

408
00:23:53,156 --> 00:23:56,813
then we blow this insignificant
pinprick off the map.

409
00:23:57,407 --> 00:23:59,811
You know our true orders.

410
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:03,862
Are you prepared to disobey?

411
00:25:32,014 --> 00:25:33,884
Thank you.
He was gonna kill me.

412
00:25:34,004 --> 00:25:35,537
Ugh, that sick son of a bitch.

413
00:25:35,926 --> 00:25:37,572
I mean, did you
see what he was doing?

414
00:25:37,692 --> 00:25:38,915
Did you hear him...

415
00:25:39,982 --> 00:25:42,961
How sloppy his incantation was?

416
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,366
My brother always was a little dim.

417
00:25:55,085 --> 00:25:57,309
He was gonna make
me the final sacrifice.

418
00:25:59,318 --> 00:26:00,520
His idea.

419
00:26:00,967 --> 00:26:01,967
But now,

420
00:26:02,515 --> 00:26:04,816
that honor goes to him.

421
00:26:06,212 --> 00:26:07,652
Our master has returned.

422
00:26:08,813 --> 00:26:10,822
This spellwork's a two-man job,
you understand?

423
00:26:12,067 --> 00:26:16,375
So for 600 years, I had to
deal with that pompous son of a bitch.

424
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,789
Planning, preparing --

425
00:26:20,835 --> 00:26:21,838
Unbearable.

426
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,003
The whole time,
I wanted to rip his face off.

427
00:26:26,308 --> 00:26:27,308
And...

428
00:26:28,443 --> 00:26:29,963
... you get him with a gun.

429
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,761
Oh, I love that.

430
00:26:34,403 --> 00:26:36,171
You know, back in the day,

431
00:26:36,648 --> 00:26:39,263
this was the one night you kept
your children inside.

432
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,919
Well, tonight,
you'll all see what halloween really is.

433
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,835
What -- what are you doing?

434
00:27:05,995 --> 00:27:07,531
Just follow my lead.

435
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:05,814
My love.

436
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,190
You've aged.

437
00:28:12,499 --> 00:28:13,695
This face...

438
00:28:15,201 --> 00:28:16,383
I can't fool you.

439
00:28:17,385 --> 00:28:19,749
Your beauty is beyond time.

440
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:26,962
Whore.

441
00:29:06,974 --> 00:29:08,452
What the hell was that?

442
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:09,785
Halloween lore.

443
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,954
People used to wear masks to
hide from him,

444
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:15,256
so I gave it a shot.

445
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:18,343
You gave it a shot?

446
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,328
How are we gonna find this mook?

447
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,561
Where would you go to raise
all the dark forces of the night?

448
00:29:47,506 --> 00:29:49,512
- A cemetery.
- Yeah.

449
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:04,431
- So, this demon's pretty powerful.
- Yeah.

450
00:30:06,741 --> 00:30:09,254
It might take more
than the usual weapons.

451
00:30:13,576 --> 00:30:15,748
Sam, no.
You're not using your psychic whatever.

452
00:30:15,868 --> 00:30:16,563
But --

453
00:30:16,683 --> 00:30:18,659
Don't even think about it.
Ruby's knife is enough.

454
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:20,705
- Why?
- Because the angel said so, for one.

455
00:30:20,825 --> 00:30:23,324
- You said they were fanatics.
- they happen to be right about this

456
00:30:23,484 --> 00:30:25,577
I don't know. Doesn't seem
they're right about much.

457
00:30:25,737 --> 00:30:28,163
- Forget the angels, okay?
- You said yourself, these powers --

458
00:30:28,323 --> 00:30:29,943
It's like playing with fire.

459
00:30:33,563 --> 00:30:34,294
Please.

460
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:53,639
Dude, i'm tripping balls.

461
00:30:56,934 --> 00:30:59,308
Yo, shh.
Be quiet. It's the cops.

462
00:31:05,556 --> 00:31:06,618
Mr. Harding?

463
00:31:07,751 --> 00:31:09,291
I mean... don?

464
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,508
Uh, don, you, uh --

465
00:31:33,628 --> 00:31:35,018
You locked us in.

466
00:32:07,588 --> 00:32:08,429
Help them.

467
00:32:08,589 --> 00:32:10,435
- Dude, you're not going off alone.
- Do it.

468
00:32:11,945 --> 00:32:13,078
Stand back!

469
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:14,227
Stand back!

470
00:32:18,302 --> 00:32:20,066
Come on, come on, get out!

471
00:32:21,014 --> 00:32:22,014
Move!

472
00:32:46,037 --> 00:32:47,427
Bring it on, stinky.

473
00:33:05,854 --> 00:33:06,988
Yeah.

474
00:33:07,148 --> 00:33:08,949
That demon-ray-gun stuff...

475
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,658
Doesn't work on me.

476
00:33:46,584 --> 00:33:48,359
Zombie-ghost orgy, huh?

477
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:50,082
Well, that's it.

478
00:33:50,439 --> 00:33:52,028
I'm torching everybody.

479
00:35:54,323 --> 00:35:56,400
Tomorrow is november 2nd.

480
00:35:57,777 --> 00:35:59,712
That's an anniversary
for you, right?

481
00:35:59,832 --> 00:36:01,267
What are you doing here?

482
00:36:01,774 --> 00:36:03,918
It's the day azazel
killed your mother,

483
00:36:04,038 --> 00:36:06,000
and 22 years later,
your girlfriend, too.

484
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,598
It must be difficult to bear,

485
00:36:08,827 --> 00:36:11,210
yet you brazenly use
the power he gave you,

486
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:13,883
his profane blood pumping
through your veins.

487
00:36:14,043 --> 00:36:15,134
Excuse me?

488
00:36:15,294 --> 00:36:17,178
You were told not
to use your abilities.

489
00:36:17,529 --> 00:36:19,168
What was I supposed to do?

490
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:21,432
That demon would have killed me

491
00:36:21,592 --> 00:36:23,726
and my brother and everyone.

492
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,566
You were told

493
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:27,188
not to.

494
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:29,963
If samhain had gotten
loose in this town --

495
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:32,430
Been warned twice now.

496
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,102
You know,
my brother was right about you.

497
00:36:36,304 --> 00:36:37,573
You are dicks.

498
00:36:45,274 --> 00:36:47,416
The only reason you're still alive,
Sam winchester,

499
00:36:47,768 --> 00:36:49,401
is because you've been useful.

500
00:36:49,521 --> 00:36:51,379
The moment that ceases to be true,

501
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:53,798
the second you become more trouble
than you're worth,

502
00:36:54,165 --> 00:36:56,259
one word... One...

503
00:36:56,927 --> 00:36:58,761
And I will turn you to dust.

504
00:37:04,704 --> 00:37:05,893
As for your brother,

505
00:37:06,443 --> 00:37:09,021
tell him that maybe he should
climb off that high horse of his.

506
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:11,647
Ask dean...

507
00:37:12,602 --> 00:37:14,400
What he remembers from hell.

508
00:37:38,336 --> 00:37:39,374
Let me guess.

509
00:37:39,494 --> 00:37:41,772
You're here for the "i told you so."

510
00:37:42,402 --> 00:37:43,264
No.

511
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:45,766
Well, good,
'cause I'm really not that interested.

512
00:37:46,813 --> 00:37:48,311
I am not here to judge you, dean.

513
00:37:49,086 --> 00:37:50,309
Then why are you here?

514
00:37:52,215 --> 00:37:53,149
Our orders --

515
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:55,106
I've had enough of these
orders of yours.

516
00:37:55,226 --> 00:37:56,249
Our orders...

517
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,027
Were not to stop the
summoning of samhain.

518
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:01,949
They were to do whatever
you told us to do.

519
00:38:05,537 --> 00:38:07,496
Your orders were
to follow my orders?

520
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:10,216
It was a test...

521
00:38:11,409 --> 00:38:13,642
To see how you would
perform under...

522
00:38:14,647 --> 00:38:16,923
Battlefield conditions,
you might say.

523
00:38:20,677 --> 00:38:21,889
It was a witch...

524
00:38:23,087 --> 00:38:24,430
Not the tet offensive.

525
00:38:27,957 --> 00:38:29,964
So, i, uh, failed your test, huh?

526
00:38:30,878 --> 00:38:31,899
I get it.

527
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,951
But you know what?

528
00:38:37,852 --> 00:38:39,570
If you were to waive that...
That magic

529
00:38:39,988 --> 00:38:43,146
 time-traveling wand of yours
and we had to do it all over again,

530
00:38:43,266 --> 00:38:44,825
i'd make the same call...

531
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:50,093
'cause, see, I don't know what's gonna
happen when these seals are broken.

532
00:38:50,213 --> 00:38:52,405
Hell, I don't know what's
gonna happen tomorrow.

533
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:55,586
But what I do know
is is that this here --

534
00:38:56,528 --> 00:38:57,948
These kids,

535
00:38:58,246 --> 00:39:00,182
the swings, the trees,

536
00:39:00,302 --> 00:39:01,175
all of it...

537
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,553
Is still here because
of my brother and me.

538
00:39:07,225 --> 00:39:08,557
You misunderstand me, dean.

539
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,226
I'm not like you think.

540
00:39:10,386 --> 00:39:12,520
I was praying that you
would choose to save the town.

541
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:14,063
You were?

542
00:39:14,973 --> 00:39:16,225
These people --

543
00:39:17,347 --> 00:39:19,870
They're all my father's creations.

544
00:39:21,718 --> 00:39:23,108
They're works of art.

545
00:39:24,847 --> 00:39:26,093
And yet...

546
00:39:26,213 --> 00:39:28,831
Even though you stopped samhain,
the seal was broken,

547
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:30,705
and we are one step closer

548
00:39:30,865 --> 00:39:33,082
to hell on earth for all creation.

549
00:39:33,242 --> 00:39:35,157
And that's not an expression, dean.

550
00:39:35,277 --> 00:39:36,252
It's literal.

551
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,455
You of all people should...

552
00:39:39,575 --> 00:39:40,881
Appreciate what that means.

553
00:39:45,478 --> 00:39:48,055
I'll tell you something if
you promise not to tell another soul.

554
00:39:48,993 --> 00:39:49,974
Okay.

555
00:39:50,534 --> 00:39:51,716
I'm not, uh...

556
00:39:53,445 --> 00:39:55,263
A hammer, as you say.

557
00:39:57,707 --> 00:39:59,525
I have questions.
I...

558
00:40:00,673 --> 00:40:02,054
I have doubts.

559
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,741
I don't know what is right
and what is wrong anymore...

560
00:40:09,028 --> 00:40:10,953
And whether you
passed or failed here.

561
00:40:13,258 --> 00:40:15,235
But in the coming months,

562
00:40:15,355 --> 00:40:17,679
you will he more decisions to make.

563
00:40:19,129 --> 00:40:22,423
I don't envy the weight
that's on your shoulders, dean.

564
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,530
I truly don't.
