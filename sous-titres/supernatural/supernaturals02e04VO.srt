1
00:00:00,442 --> 00:00:02,427
he wants us to pick up
where he left off --

2
00:00:02,427 --> 00:00:05,469
saving people,hunting things.
The family business.

3
00:00:05,469 --> 00:00:07,464
THEN

4
00:00:08,172 --> 00:00:10,157
Today's your lucky day,kid.

5
00:00:11,265 --> 00:00:14,048
- You watch out for sammy,okay?
- Yeah,dad. You know I will.

6
00:00:14,048 --> 00:00:15,055
Dad.

7
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:19,564
Time of death -- 10:41 A.M.

8
00:00:19,913 --> 00:00:22,985
I miss him,man,and I'm not all right.
Neither are you.

9
00:00:22,985 --> 00:00:24,960
I'm dealing
with dad's death!

10
00:00:26,447 --> 00:00:28,631
Dad's dead,and it hurts so bad,
you can't take it.

11
00:00:28,631 --> 00:00:31,344
I'm okay! I swear,the next
person who asks if I'm okay,

12
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:33,250
I'm gonna start
throwing punches.

13
00:00:36,197 --> 00:00:38,307
NOW

14
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,110
Okay,we got booze...

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,320
we got chocolate...

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,920
and...wait for it.

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,550
Tortured emo rock.

18
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,740
Guaranteed cure
for any broken heart.

19
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,980
You didn't
have to do all this.

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,600
I'm fine.

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,370
Yeah,I can see that.

22
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,510
Thanks,neal.

23
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,790
You're a good friend.

24
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,200
It's probably him.

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,310
I'll take care of it.

26
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,600
Where is she?

27
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,710
Chill out
and think about this,okay?

28
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,230
- I need to talk to her.
- Some other time.

29
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,470
You get out of my face now.

30
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,180
Angela?

31
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,860
Leave...me...alone.

32
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,630
Angela,I'm sorry.

33
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,830
You're sorry?

34
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,090
You're sorry?
Oh,that's great.

35
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,440
Angela,listen to me.

36
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,040
I don't want to listen to you!

37
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,790
- I'm done listening!
- Listen to me.

38
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,780
How could
you do this? I loved you.

39
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,190
Angela?

40
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,930
Angela!

44
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,560
Come on,sam.
I'm begging you. This is stupid.

45
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,600
Why?

46
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,770
Going to visit mom's grave?

47
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,030
She doesn't even have a grave.
There was no body left after the fire.

48
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,190
She has a headstone.

49
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,400
Put up by our uncle,
a man that we've never met.

50
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,880
You want to pay your respects
to a slab of granite put up by a stranger.

51
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,360
- That's not the point.
- Then enlighten me.

52
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,350
It's not about
a body or a casket.

53
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,150
It's about her memory,
okay?

54
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,750
And after dad,it just --

55
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,480
it just feels like
the right thing to do.

56
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,930
It's irrational
is what it is.

57
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,550
Look,man,
no one asked you to come.

58
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,240
Why don't we swing
by the roadhouse instead?

59
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,090
We haven't heard anything on the demon lately.
We should be hunting that son of a bitch down.

60
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,680
That's a good idea.
You should.

61
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,950
Just drop me off,I'll hitch a ride,
and I'll meet you there tomorrow.

62
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,840
Right.

63
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,260
Stuck with those people,
making awkward small talk until you show up.

64
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,060
No,thanks.

65
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,160
CHILDREN SHOULDN`T PALY WITH DEAD THINGS

66
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,300
I think,uh...

67
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,090
I think dad would have
wanted you to have these.

68
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,550
I love you,mom.

69
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,000
Thank you.

70
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,400
Angela mason.

71
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,500
She was a student at the local college.
Her funeral was three days ago.

72
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,180
And?

73
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,560
And?

74
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,110
You saw her grave --
everything dead around it in a perfect circle.

75
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,440
You don't think
that's a little weird?

76
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,630
Maybe the grounds keeper
went a little agro with the pesticide.

77
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:15,630
No,I asked him. No pesticide,no chemicals.
Nobody can explain it.

78
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,390
Okay,
so,what are you thinking?

79
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,950
I don't know.
Unholy ground,maybe.

80
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,790
what?

81
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,730
If something evil happened,it
could easily poison the ground.

82
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,130
Remember the farm
outside of cedar rapids?

83
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:29,830
Yeah.

84
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,920
It could be the sign
of a demonic presence...

85
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,720
...or the angela girl's spirit,
if it's powerful enough.

86
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,660
Well,don't get too excited.
You might pull something.

87
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,790
It's just stumbling
onto a hunt...

88
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,650
- here of all places?
- So?

89
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,170
So,are you sure this is about
a hunt,not something else?

90
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,640
What else
would it be about?

91
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,750
Just forget it.

92
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,800
Believe what you want,sam,

93
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,920
but I let you
drag my ass out here.
The least we can do
is check this out.

94
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,310
Yeah,fine.

95
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,320
The girl's dad works in town.
He's a professor at the school.

96
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,710
- Dr. Mason?
- YeS.

97
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,250
I'm sam.
This is dean.

98
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,300
We were friends
of angela'S.

99
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,920
We -- we wanted to offer
our condolences.

100
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,320
Please come in.

101
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,420
She was beautiful.

102
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,500
Yes,she was.

103
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,320
This is an unusual book.

104
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,590
It's ancient greek.
I teach a course.

105
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,000
So,a car accident.
That's -- that's horrible.

106
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,860
Angie was only a mile
away from home when...

107
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,880
it's got to be hard...
losing someone like that.

108
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,200
Sometimes it's like
they're still around,

109
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,410
almost like you can still
sense their presence.

110
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,180
You ever feel anything
like that?

111
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,010
I do,as a matter of fact.

112
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,870
That's perfectly normal,
dr. Mason,

113
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,190
especially with what
you're going through.

114
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,040
You know,
I still phone her.

115
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,330
And the phone's ringing
before I remember that,uh...

116
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,700
family's everything,
you know?

117
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,910
Angie was the most important
thing in my life.

118
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,800
And now I'm just lost
without her.

119
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,920
I'm very sorry.

120
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,970
There's something going on.
We just haven't found it yet.

121
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,460
Dean,so far you got a patch
of dead grass and nothing.

122
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,700
Well,something turned
that grave into unholy ground.

123
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,250
There's no reason
for it to be unholy ground.

124
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,560
Angela mason was a nice girl
who died in a car crash.

125
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,000
That's not exactly
vengeful-spirit material.

126
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,560
You heard her father.

127
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,350
Maybe daddy doesn't know  everything
there is to know about his little angel,

128
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,650
You know what? We never should
have bothered that poor man.

129
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,390
We shouldn't even
be here anymore.

130
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:43,460
So,what,sam?We just bail without even
figuring out what's going on?

131
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,620
I think I know
what's going on here.

132
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,300
It's the only reason
I went along with you this far.

133
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,510
- What are you talking about?
- This is about mom's grave.

134
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,610
Got nothing to do with it.

135
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,730
You wouldn't step
within 100 yards of it.

136
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,310
Look,maybe you're imagining
a hunt where there isn't one

137
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,150
so you don't have to think
about mom or dad.

138
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,060
You want to take another swing?
Go ahead

139
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,550
if it will make you feel better.

140
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,040
I don't need this crap.

141
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,940
Dean,where are you going?

142
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,610
I'm gonna go get a drink...

143
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,530
alone.

144
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,900
- Who the hell are you?!
- Wait,wait,wait,wait.

145
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,390
Hold on!

146
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,930
I'm calling 911!

147
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,480
- 'm angela's cousin.
- What?

148
00:12:33,531 --> 00:12:36,771
Yeah,her dad sent me over
to pick up her stuff.

149
00:12:36,771 --> 00:12:40,101
My name's alan --
alan stanwick.

150
00:12:43,652 --> 00:12:46,222
Her dad didn't say
that you were coming.

151
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:49,153
Well,I mean...

152
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:53,233
How else would I have the key
to your place?

153
00:13:02,535 --> 00:13:08,885
So,I'm sure you got a view of angela
that none of the family got to see.

154
00:13:08,886 --> 00:13:10,956
Tell me,what was she like?

155
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,556
What was she really like?

156
00:13:12,556 --> 00:13:14,546
She was great...

157
00:13:14,547 --> 00:13:18,007
just...great.

158
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:20,587
I mean,she was so...

159
00:13:23,118 --> 00:13:24,338
great.

160
00:13:24,338 --> 00:13:26,788
Yeah.

161
00:13:27,288 --> 00:13:29,628
Yeah.

162
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:35,939
You two must have been
really close,huh?

163
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,420
We were.

164
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,980
But it's not just her,
it's matt.

165
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:43,961
Who?

166
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:45,561
Angela's boyfriend.

167
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:47,661
Right -- matt.

168
00:13:48,051 --> 00:13:49,511
Uh,what about him?

169
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:52,042
He killed himself last night.

170
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:55,302
He cut his own throat.
Who does that?

171
00:13:56,073 --> 00:13:58,593
That'S...terrible.

172
00:13:58,593 --> 00:14:02,753
He was taking angela's death
pretty hard,and I guess...

173
00:14:04,714 --> 00:14:07,644
I mean,he'd been messed up
about it for days.

174
00:14:07,644 --> 00:14:08,884
Messed up how?

175
00:14:08,884 --> 00:14:11,774
He kept saying
that he saw her everywhere.

176
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:13,695
Well,I'm --
I'm sure that's normal.

177
00:14:13,695 --> 00:14:15,655
I mean,with everything
he was going through.

178
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:18,365
He said that he saw her...

179
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:21,526
as in an acid trip
or something.

180
00:14:22,807 --> 00:14:24,987
Were angela and matt
a happy couple?

181
00:14:24,987 --> 00:14:27,747
I mean,was there any reason
that angela would be angry with him?

182
00:14:27,747 --> 00:14:29,527
What?

183
00:14:29,527 --> 00:14:32,287
No,of course not.
Why do you ask?

184
00:14:32,658 --> 00:14:35,368
Just asking.

185
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:39,089
Where did matt live?

186
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:41,042
Next on cinemax,

187
00:14:41,042 --> 00:14:43,137
"casa erotica iv,"

188
00:14:43,138 --> 00:14:46,151
a tale of two latin beauties,

189
00:14:47,718 --> 00:14:49,324
Hey.

190
00:14:52,028 --> 00:14:53,684
What?

191
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,560
Awkward.

192
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,344
- Where the hell were you?
- Just working my imaginary case.

193
00:14:59,552 --> 00:15:01,437
Yeah? And?

194
00:15:01,438 --> 00:15:04,221
Oh,well,you were right.
I didn't find much.

195
00:15:04,222 --> 00:15:07,145
Yeah. Except angela's boyfriend
died last night --

196
00:15:07,145 --> 00:15:09,749
slit his own throat,
but,you know,that's normal.

197
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:11,087
Uh,let's see.
What else?

198
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:14,908
Oh,he was seeing angela
everywhere before he died.

199
00:15:14,908 --> 00:15:18,230
But,you know,I'm sure  that's just me
transferring my own feelings.

200
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:19,777
Okay,I get it.

201
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:21,604
I'm sorry. Maybe there is
something going on here.

202
00:15:21,604 --> 00:15:23,250
Maybe?

203
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,241
Sam,I know how to do my job
despite what you might think.

204
00:15:28,778 --> 00:15:31,112
We should check out
the guy's apartment.

205
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:33,667
I just came from there...

206
00:15:33,668 --> 00:15:36,591
a pile of dead plants
just like the cemetery.

207
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:38,347
Hell,a dead goldfish,too.

208
00:15:38,347 --> 00:15:41,031
- So,unholy ground?
- Maybe.

209
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:45,003
I'm still not getting
that powerful angry-spirit vibe from angela.

210
00:15:45,582 --> 00:15:47,567
I've been reading this,
though.

211
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,819
- You stole the girl's diary?
- Yeah,sam.

212
00:15:57,186 --> 00:15:59,161
And if anything,
the girl's a little too nice.

213
00:15:59,162 --> 00:16:00,578
So,what do you want to do?

214
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:02,365
Keep digging,
talk to more of her friends.

215
00:16:02,365 --> 00:16:04,889
- You get any names?
- You kidding me?

216
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,262
I have her bestest friend
in the whole wide world.

217
00:16:10,312 --> 00:16:12,979
I didn't realize the college
employed grief counselors.

218
00:16:12,979 --> 00:16:14,195
Oh,yeah.

219
00:16:14,196 --> 00:16:15,943
Yeah,you talk,we listen

220
00:16:15,944 --> 00:16:20,145
and maybe throw in a little therapeutic
collage whatever helps jump-start the healing.

221
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,497
Well,I think I'm okay.
Thanks.

222
00:16:23,498 --> 00:16:26,503
Well,you heard what happened
to matt harrison,right?

223
00:16:26,503 --> 00:16:27,913
Yeah,I did.

224
00:16:27,914 --> 00:16:30,725
We just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

225
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:34,200
Grief can make people
do crazy things.

226
00:16:35,887 --> 00:16:39,658
Look,I'm sorry about
what happened to him.I am.

227
00:16:39,658 --> 00:16:42,693
But if matt killed himself,
it wasn't 'cause of grief.

228
00:16:42,694 --> 00:16:44,431
No?
Then why?

229
00:16:44,432 --> 00:16:46,507
It was guilt.

230
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:48,909
Angie's death was matt's fault,
and he knew it.

231
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:50,800
How was matt responsible?

232
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,273
She really loved that guy,

233
00:16:53,274 --> 00:16:56,933
but the night of the accident,
she walked in on him with another girl.

234
00:16:58,957 --> 00:17:02,330
She was really torn up.
That's why she crashed.

235
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:05,877
Um,look,
I got to get ready for work,

236
00:17:05,878 --> 00:17:11,418
so thanks for the concern,
but,seriously,I'll be okay.

237
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:18,044
Well,my vengeful-spirit theory
is starting to make a little more sense.

238
00:17:18,044 --> 00:17:20,636
I mean,hell hath no fury.

239
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:24,695
So,if angela got her revenge
on matt,you think it's over?

240
00:17:26,032 --> 00:17:28,126
Well,
there's one way to be sure.

241
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:32,064
Yeah?
What's that?

242
00:17:32,454 --> 00:17:34,069
Burn the bones.

243
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,124
Burn the bones?

244
00:17:36,573 --> 00:17:40,193
Are you high?
Angela died last week.

245
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,549
So?

246
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:46,126
So there's not gonna be bones. There's
gonna be a ripe,rotting body in the coffin.

247
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:49,088
Since when are you afraid
to get dirty,huh?

248
00:18:14,826 --> 00:18:16,676
Ladies first.

249
00:18:19,706 --> 00:18:21,626
Hold that.

250
00:18:57,296 --> 00:18:59,856
I missed you.

251
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,802
They buried the body
four days ago.

252
00:19:21,802 --> 00:19:24,237
I don't get it.

253
00:19:24,238 --> 00:19:25,805
Look.

254
00:19:29,474 --> 00:19:31,604
- What is that?
- I'm not sure.

255
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,632
I've seen these kinds
of symbols before.

256
00:19:37,095 --> 00:19:40,507
Dean,take it easy,okay?

257
00:19:47,652 --> 00:19:49,293
You're angie's friends.

258
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:51,824
- Dr. Mason --
- we need to talk.

259
00:19:52,635 --> 00:19:54,366
Well,come in.

260
00:19:55,347 --> 00:19:56,848
Thanks.

261
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:02,102
You teach ancient greek.

262
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:04,123
Tell me...

263
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:06,585
what are these?

264
00:20:08,437 --> 00:20:10,118
I don't understand.

265
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:12,859
You said this had something
to do with angela.

266
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,992
It does.
Please,just humor me.

267
00:20:17,953 --> 00:20:20,965
They're part of an ancient greek
divination ritual.

268
00:20:20,965 --> 00:20:23,486
- Used for necromancy,right.
- That's right.

269
00:20:23,487 --> 00:20:24,607
See,
before we came over here,

270
00:20:24,608 --> 00:20:27,790
we stopped by the library and
did a little homework ourselves.

271
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:31,932
Apparently,
they use rituals like this one
for communicating with the dead,

272
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:35,825
even bringing corpses back to
life -- full-on zombie action.

273
00:20:35,826 --> 00:20:37,737
Yeah.

274
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,999
I mean,
according to the legends.

275
00:20:42,311 --> 00:20:43,962
Now,what's this all about?

276
00:20:43,962 --> 00:20:46,023
- I think you know.
- Dean.

277
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,054
Look,I get it.

278
00:20:48,055 --> 00:20:51,257
There are people that I would
give anything to see again,

279
00:20:51,257 --> 00:20:52,427
but what gives you
the right?

280
00:20:52,428 --> 00:20:53,678
- Dean.
- What are you talking about?

281
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,240
- What's dead should stay dead!
- What?

282
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,701
- Stop it!
- What you brought back isn't your daughter!

283
00:20:57,701 --> 00:21:00,222
These things are vicious,
they're violent!

284
00:21:00,223 --> 00:21:02,374
They're so nasty,
they rot the ground around them.

285
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:05,066
I mean,come on!
Haven't you seen "pet sematary"?

286
00:21:05,067 --> 00:21:07,678
You're insane.

287
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:10,910
- Where is she?
- Get out of my house.

288
00:21:10,911 --> 00:21:13,182
I know you're hiding her somewhere.
Where is she?!

289
00:21:13,182 --> 00:21:15,493
Dean,stop!
That's enough.
Dean,look --

290
00:21:15,494 --> 00:21:19,716
beautiful,living plants.
We're leaving.

291
00:21:19,717 --> 00:21:21,888
- I'm calling the police.
- Sir,we're sorry.

292
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:24,550
We won't bother you again.

293
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:29,584
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- Back off.

294
00:21:29,584 --> 00:21:31,925
That man is innocent.
He didn't deserve that.

295
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:34,186
So she's not here. Maybe he's
keeping her somewhere else.

296
00:21:34,187 --> 00:21:36,348
Stop it!
That's enough,okay? Enough!

297
00:21:36,348 --> 00:21:38,699
- Sam,I know what I'm doing.
- No,you don'T...at all.

298
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:42,222
I don't scare easy,but you're
scaring the crap out of me.

299
00:21:42,223 --> 00:21:43,694
Don't be overdramatic,
sam.

300
00:21:43,694 --> 00:21:45,645
You're lucky this turned out
to be a real case,

301
00:21:45,645 --> 00:21:48,737
'cause if it wasn't,you would've found
something else to kill.

302
00:21:48,737 --> 00:21:50,628
You're on edge,
you're erratic,

303
00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:53,441
except for when
you're hunting,'cause then
you're downright scary.

304
00:21:53,441 --> 00:21:55,432
You're tailspinning,man,

305
00:21:55,432 --> 00:21:58,944
and you refuse to talk about it,
and you won't let me help you.

306
00:21:58,945 --> 00:22:00,436
I can take care of myself,
thanks.

307
00:22:00,436 --> 00:22:02,317
No,you can't!

308
00:22:02,317 --> 00:22:05,589
And you're the only one
who thinks you should have to.

309
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:07,990
You don't have to handle this
on your own. No one can.

310
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:11,743
- If you bring up dad's death one more time --
- dean,it's killing you. Please.

311
00:22:14,256 --> 00:22:16,937
We've already lost dad.

312
00:22:16,937 --> 00:22:18,778
We lost mom.

313
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:21,811
I've lost jessica.

314
00:22:21,811 --> 00:22:24,773
And now I'm gonna
lose you,too?

315
00:22:26,494 --> 00:22:29,165
We better get out of here
before the cops come.

316
00:22:30,587 --> 00:22:32,778
I hear you,okay?

317
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:35,510
I'm being an ass,
and I'm sorry.

318
00:22:35,511 --> 00:22:39,253
But we got a freakin' zombie running around.
We need to figure out how to kill it.

319
00:22:42,246 --> 00:22:43,997
Right?

320
00:22:43,997 --> 00:22:46,418
Our lives are weird,man.

321
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:48,700
You're telling me.

322
00:22:49,652 --> 00:22:55,908
Come on

323
00:22:53,312 --> 00:22:58,787
Honey,
is something bothering you?

324
00:22:57,854 --> 00:22:59,705
It's about matt.

325
00:22:59,706 --> 00:23:01,557
Haven't we already
talked about that?

326
00:23:01,557 --> 00:23:02,757
I know,but,uh --

327
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:06,320
haven't we wasted enough time
on him already?

328
00:23:07,061 --> 00:23:10,032
Come sit down.

329
00:23:17,027 --> 00:23:20,579
You always said
that he didn't deserve me.

330
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:23,831
- You were right.
- Angela...

331
00:23:26,263 --> 00:23:30,015
you didn't get out
and go see matt or...

332
00:23:30,016 --> 00:23:32,197
I've been here
the whole time.

333
00:23:33,908 --> 00:23:38,460
Neal...you really think
I could do something like that?

334
00:23:38,461 --> 00:23:41,172
No,I...
I don't know.

335
00:23:41,913 --> 00:23:44,724
I can't help it.
You just -- you seem...

336
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:46,596
different?

337
00:23:47,497 --> 00:23:50,589
You're right.
I am.

338
00:23:53,251 --> 00:23:55,982
I've realized...

339
00:23:55,983 --> 00:23:59,545
you're the only one
who ever really loved me.

340
00:24:01,526 --> 00:24:06,018
You proved that.
You brought me back.

341
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:08,520
I'm with you now.

342
00:24:09,362 --> 00:24:12,664
Isn't that
what you always wanted?

343
00:24:15,682 --> 00:24:17,950
We can't just waste her
with a head shot?

344
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,780
Dude,you've been wahing
way too many romero flicks.

345
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,887
You're telling me there's
no lore on how to smoke them?

346
00:24:22,887 --> 00:24:25,215
No,I'm telling you
there's too much.

347
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,302
There's 100 different legends
on the walking dead,

348
00:24:27,303 --> 00:24:29,209
but they all have different
methods for killing them.

349
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:33,645
Some say
setting them on fire.
One said -- where is it?

350
00:24:33,645 --> 00:24:36,013
Right here -- feeding
their hearts to wild dogs.

351
00:24:36,014 --> 00:24:37,850
That's my personal favorite.

352
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,515
But who knows what's real
and what's myth?

353
00:24:39,516 --> 00:24:41,101
Is there anything
they have in common?

354
00:24:41,102 --> 00:24:43,339
No,but a few
said silver might work.

355
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,835
Silver's a start.

356
00:24:44,835 --> 00:24:46,571
But now how are
we going to find angela?

357
00:24:46,571 --> 00:24:48,256
We got to figure out
who brought her back.

358
00:24:48,257 --> 00:24:49,882
Any ideas?

359
00:24:49,883 --> 00:24:52,943
I think if it's not her dad,
it might be that guy,neal.

360
00:24:52,944 --> 00:24:54,348
- Neal?
- Yep.

361
00:24:54,349 --> 00:24:57,128
How'd you come up with that?
Well,you got your journal,I got mine.

362
00:24:58,433 --> 00:24:59,948
"Neal's a real shoulder
to cry on.

363
00:24:59,949 --> 00:25:03,752
He so understands what
I'm going through with matt."

364
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:07,856
There's more here where that came from. It's
got unrequited duckie love written all over it.

365
00:25:07,857 --> 00:25:10,345
But that doesn't mean he
brought her back from the dead.

366
00:25:10,345 --> 00:25:12,884
Hmm,did I mention that
he's professor mason's T.A.?

367
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:15,825
Has access
to all the same books.

368
00:25:20,944 --> 00:25:22,745
Hello?

369
00:25:26,229 --> 00:25:28,250
Neal!

370
00:25:28,893 --> 00:25:31,655
It's your grief counselors.
We've come to hug.

371
00:25:35,231 --> 00:25:36,692
Silver bullets?

372
00:25:36,692 --> 00:25:39,895
Yeah,enough to make her rattle
like a change purse.

373
00:26:06,177 --> 00:26:08,579
Unless it's where
he keeps his porn.

374
00:26:36,484 --> 00:26:39,027
It sure looks like
a zombie pen to me.

375
00:26:39,027 --> 00:26:40,437
Yeah.

376
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:42,981
An empty one.

377
00:26:44,423 --> 00:26:47,346
You think angela's
gone after somebody?

378
00:26:56,788 --> 00:26:58,850
No,I think she went out
to rent "beaches."

379
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,923
Look,smartass.
She might kill someone.

380
00:27:01,924 --> 00:27:04,166
We got to find her,dean.

381
00:27:04,617 --> 00:27:06,788
Yeah.

382
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,332
All right,she clipped matt
because he was cheating,right?

383
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:11,334
Yeah.

384
00:27:11,336 --> 00:27:16,111
Well,takes two to,you know,
have hard-core sex.

385
00:27:16,992 --> 00:27:18,052
I don't know.
It just seemed

386
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,585
that angela's roommate was...

387
00:27:20,586 --> 00:27:23,728
broken up
over matt's death.

388
00:27:24,171 --> 00:27:28,495
I mean,
like really broken up.

389
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,636
Hello?

390
00:27:56,256 --> 00:27:58,315
Hi,lindsay.
I'm home.

391
00:28:07,376 --> 00:28:09,336
You know what you did.

392
00:28:12,117 --> 00:28:13,250
I'm sorry!

393
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,816
I am so sorry!

394
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,611
Not sorry enough!

395
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,013
God.

396
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,335
God.

397
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:44,783
Oh,my god.

398
00:28:44,784 --> 00:28:46,025
Oh,my god.

399
00:29:16,052 --> 00:29:17,569
I got you.
I got you.

400
00:29:20,694 --> 00:29:22,734
Damn,
that dead chick can run.

401
00:29:22,736 --> 00:29:24,943
What now?

402
00:29:25,437 --> 00:29:27,821
I say we go have a little chat
with neal.

403
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:34,553
So,the silver bullets,
they did something,right?

404
00:29:34,553 --> 00:29:37,987
Yeah,something,but not enough.
What else you got?

405
00:29:39,074 --> 00:29:40,524
Um,okay,besides silver,

406
00:29:40,525 --> 00:29:43,949
we have "nailing the undead
back into their grave beds."

407
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:48,252
It's mentioned a few times. It's probably
where the whole vampire-staking lore came from.

408
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,424
Their grave beds?
You serious?

409
00:29:50,424 --> 00:29:51,440
Yeah.

410
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:54,609
How the hell are we gonna get
angela back to the cemetery?

411
00:30:06,402 --> 00:30:08,380
What are you guys doing here?

412
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:13,146
You know,I've heard of some people
doing some pretty desperate things to get laid,

413
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:14,864
but you

414
00:30:14,865 --> 00:30:17,043
You take the cake.

415
00:30:17,043 --> 00:30:18,631
Okay,who are you guys?

416
00:30:18,632 --> 00:30:20,980
You might want to ask angela
that question.

417
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,118
- What?
- We know what you did.

418
00:30:24,228 --> 00:30:27,225
The ritual...everything.

419
00:30:28,664 --> 00:30:30,082
You're crazy.

420
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:33,410
Your girlfriend's past her expiration date,
and we're crazy?

421
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,537
When someone's gone,
they should stay gone.

422
00:30:36,538 --> 00:30:39,445
You don't mess
with that kind of stuff.

423
00:30:39,446 --> 00:30:41,694
Angela killed matt.

424
00:30:41,694 --> 00:30:44,631
She tried to kill lindsay.

425
00:30:44,632 --> 00:30:47,909
I don't know
what you're talking about.

426
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:51,966
Hey,no more crap,neal!

427
00:30:51,967 --> 00:30:54,435
This blood
is on your hands.

428
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:58,282
Now,me and him can make this right,
but you got to tell us where she is.

429
00:30:59,171 --> 00:31:00,949
Tell us!

430
00:31:03,098 --> 00:31:05,066
My house.

431
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:07,064
She's at my house.

432
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:19,535
You sure about that?

433
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:31,456
Listen. It doesn't really matter
where she is.

434
00:31:32,655 --> 00:31:35,183
There's only one way
to stop her.

435
00:31:35,183 --> 00:31:39,729
We've got to perform another ritual over
her grave  to reverse the one that you did.

436
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:43,676
We're going to need some black roots,
some scar weed,some candles.

437
00:31:43,677 --> 00:31:45,675
It's very complicated,
but it will get the job done.

438
00:31:45,675 --> 00:31:48,163
She'll be dead again
in a couple hours.

439
00:31:48,163 --> 00:31:50,391
I think you should
come with us.

440
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:57,446
I'm serious,neal.
Leave with us right now.

441
00:31:57,446 --> 00:31:59,134
No.

442
00:31:59,894 --> 00:32:01,812
No.

443
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:08,717
Listen to me.

444
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,066
Get out of here
as soon as you can.

445
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:16,051
But most of all,be cool.
No sudden movements.

446
00:32:16,052 --> 00:32:19,019
Don't make her mad.

447
00:32:21,918 --> 00:32:23,426
Let's go.

448
00:32:39,961 --> 00:32:41,762
You said
you'd stay in the house.

449
00:32:41,762 --> 00:32:45,124
I'm sorry.
I just needed to see you.

450
00:32:45,405 --> 00:32:47,897
Neal,please.

451
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:52,951
You have to help me.

452
00:32:55,653 --> 00:32:57,274
Oh,god.

453
00:32:57,275 --> 00:33:00,667
Come with me to the cemetery.
Neal,they're trying to kill me.

454
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:02,198
We have to stop them.

455
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:04,360
You mean kill them?

456
00:33:05,661 --> 00:33:07,652
It's true --

457
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:10,675
- matt and lindsay.
- They hurt me.

458
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:14,468
If you love me,you'll make sure
nobody hurts me again.

459
00:33:14,469 --> 00:33:17,881
Take me to the cemetery,
then all this will be over.

460
00:33:17,881 --> 00:33:21,053
We can start
new lives together.

461
00:33:23,146 --> 00:33:25,127
Okay.

462
00:33:26,388 --> 00:33:29,030
God help me,but okay.

463
00:33:29,821 --> 00:33:32,162
I'll go get the car.

464
00:33:32,163 --> 00:33:33,594
Just...

465
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,765
just wait here.

466
00:33:59,075 --> 00:34:01,066
Neal,you look nervous.

467
00:34:01,637 --> 00:34:03,738
No,I'm fine.

468
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:08,042
Were you...
going to leave me?

469
00:34:08,473 --> 00:34:10,034
No,of course not.

470
00:34:10,034 --> 00:34:12,375
You were,weren't you?!

471
00:34:12,376 --> 00:34:15,748
How could you?!
Neal,I loved you!

472
00:34:15,749 --> 00:34:16,980
Angela --

473
00:34:29,648 --> 00:34:32,217
You really think
this is gonna work?

474
00:34:32,217 --> 00:34:34,786
No,not really.

475
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,609
But it was the only thing
I could come up with.

476
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:37,908
Wait.
It's not what you think.

477
00:35:37,923 --> 00:35:41,193
I didn't ask to be brought back,
but it's still me.

478
00:35:41,193 --> 00:35:44,215
I'm still a person.
Please.

479
00:36:20,201 --> 00:36:22,248
Please don't!

480
00:36:39,067 --> 00:36:41,608
What's dead should stay dead.

481
00:36:48,045 --> 00:36:49,419
Rest in peace.

482
00:36:49,419 --> 00:36:51,586
Yeah,
for good this time,okay?

483
00:36:58,058 --> 00:36:59,733
You know,

484
00:37:00,145 --> 00:37:01,910
the whole fake-ritual thing,

485
00:37:01,911 --> 00:37:05,794
luring angela into the
cemetery -- pretty sharp.

486
00:37:05,795 --> 00:37:07,731
Thanks.

487
00:37:07,731 --> 00:37:10,319
But did we have to use me
as bait?

488
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,193
I figured you were more her type,you know?
She had pretty crappy taste in guys.

489
00:37:14,604 --> 00:37:16,781
I think she broke my hand.

490
00:37:17,283 --> 00:37:20,614
You're just too fragile.
We'll get it looked at later.

491
00:37:26,023 --> 00:37:28,240
You want to stay
for a while?

492
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:35,064
No.

493
00:38:42,218 --> 00:38:44,280
Dean,what is it?

494
00:38:48,336 --> 00:38:49,807
I'm sorry.

495
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,292
For what?

496
00:38:55,025 --> 00:38:57,658
The way I've been acting.

497
00:39:15,512 --> 00:39:17,754
And for dad.

498
00:39:20,198 --> 00:39:23,352
Well,
he was your dad,too.

499
00:39:24,143 --> 00:39:25,945
It's my fault
that he's gone.

500
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,828
What are you
talking about?

501
00:39:27,828 --> 00:39:30,781
I know you've been thinking it.
So have I.

502
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:34,146
Doesn't take a genius
to figure it out.

503
00:39:35,528 --> 00:39:39,823
Back at the hospital,
I had a full recovery.

504
00:39:39,824 --> 00:39:42,607
It was a miracle.

505
00:39:42,608 --> 00:39:45,371
And five minutes later,
dad's dead,and the colt's gone.

506
00:39:45,371 --> 00:39:49,025
You can't tell me
there's not a connection there.

507
00:39:50,859 --> 00:39:53,903
I don't know
how the demon was involved.

508
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:57,897
I don't know how the whole thing
went down exactly...

509
00:39:58,449 --> 00:40:02,013
but dad's dead because of me.

510
00:40:02,013 --> 00:40:03,635
And that much I do know.

511
00:40:03,636 --> 00:40:06,039
We don't know that,
not for sure.

512
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:09,032
Sam...

513
00:40:10,294 --> 00:40:14,319
you and dad...

514
00:40:15,561 --> 00:40:18,544
you're the most important people
in my life.

515
00:40:18,976 --> 00:40:22,620
And now...

516
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:26,595
I never should have come back,
sam. It wasn't natural.

517
00:40:28,088 --> 00:40:30,941
And now look

00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:40,143
And I should have
stayed dead.

how I was feeling.

Well,that's it.

522
00:40:55,595 --> 00:40:57,627

523
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:05,928
What could you possibly say
