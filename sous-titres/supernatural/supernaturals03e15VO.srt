1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,880
I got a year to live,sam.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,110
I'd like to make the most of it.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,530
So what do you say we kill some evil sons 
of bitches and we raise a little hell?

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,480
THEN

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,980
You didn't tell dean?Tell me what?

6
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,310
There's a big new up-and-comer.

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,180
Her name is lilith.

8
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,500
She really,really wants sam's 
intestines on a stick.

9
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,340
Let dean out of his deal right now.

10
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,490
I'm just a saleswoman.

11
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,950
I got a boss like everybody.

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,200
Who holds the contract?

13
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,640
I can't tell you.

14
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,130
Bela talbot's her real name.

15
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,130
The colt.

16
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,520
Bela stole the colt.

17
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,590
I want it back,bela.

18
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,070
Your little pistol,you mean?

19
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:32,780
Sorry.

20
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,230
You understand how many people 
are gonna die if you do this?

21
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,550
What exactly is it that you think 
I plan to do with it?

22
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,680
Take the only weapon we have against an army 
of demons and sell it to the highest bidder.

23
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,080
You know nothing about me.

24
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,250
- Pack your crap.
- Why?

25
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,260
Where are we going?

26
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,470
We're gonna go hunt the bitch down.

27
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,500
I don't want to go to hell.

28
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,650
We'll find a way to save you.

29
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:49,980
I'm scared,sam.

30
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,250
I'm really scared.

31
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,090
And the only person that can get 
me out of this thing is me.

32
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,690
And me.

33
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,540
NOW

34
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,510
Up for a drink?

35
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,350
No,I can'T.

36
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,930
I got to be up at the crack of dawn.

37
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,500
Duty calls.

38
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,790
Boob job?

39
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,800
I wish.

40
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,290
Nah,some crabby old broad wants the works.

41
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,140
I need a forklift to get it all back up.

42
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,910
All that work to have,what,
15 minutes off their faces?

43
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,760
Staying young is a brutal business.

44
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,100
Hey!

45
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,320
Help!

46
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,040
Help!

47
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,560
Help!

48
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,850
Help!

49
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,070
Let me out of here!

50
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,640
Help!

51
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,580
Sir?

52
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,730
Please.

53
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,360
It's okay,sir.

54
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,090
Let me see what happened.

55
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,550
Don't you worry.

56
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,510
There's nothing I haven't seen.

57
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,290
No.No.No.

61
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,380
- Stop!
- You ready to talk?

62
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,910
I don't know.

63
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,460
I don't know anything!

64
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,720
Oh,you hear that,sam?

65
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,530
He doesn't know anything.

66
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,730
Yeah,I heard.

67
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,080
I'm telling you the truth.

68
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,280
Oh,you are?

69
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,500
My god,then I owe you an apology.

70
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,370
Allow me to make it up to you.

71
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:23,230
I'm gonna ask you one last time ... 
who holds my contract?

72
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,150
Your mother.

73
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,030
Yeah,she,uh,showed it to me right 
before I bent her over.

74
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,750
- I want a name or else ...
- or what,hmm?

75
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,200
You're gonna squirt your 
holy water in both ends?

76
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,710
Please.

77
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:00,090
Brother,that's like a fleabite compared 
to what's coming to me if I tell you jack.

78
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,590
Do what you want.

79
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:08,120
The only thing I'm scared of 
is the demon holding your ticket.

80
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,120
Exorcizamus te.

81
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,990
Omnis immundus spiritus.

82
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,390
How does that feel?Does that feel good?

83
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,330
Go ahead.

84
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,530
Send me back to hell.

85
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,010
'cause when you get there,
I'll be waiting for you.

86
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,440
with a few pals who are dying for a nice 
little meet and greet with dean winchester.

87
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,850
Should I?

88
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,420
Stick him someplace he 
can't hurt anyone else.

89
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,830
Omnis incursio infernalis 
adversarii,omnis legio.

90
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,140
Omnis incursio infernalis adversarii.

91
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,470
omnis legio,omnis congregatio.

92
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,250
et secta diabolica.

93
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,820
You ran the prints twice?

94
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,290
Are you sure?

95
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,060
Okay.

96
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,610
Yeah,just chalk it up to lab error.

97
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,170
Don't I know it.

98
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,250
Okay.

99
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,860
Thanks.Yeah,I'll tell the lieutenant.

100
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,970
Bury the body?

101
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,710
Yeah.Poor schmuck.

102
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,910
Looks like these demons ride 
'em hard just for kicks.

103
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,900
What was the phone call about?

104
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,850
Remember that thing in the paper yesterday?

105
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,040
"Stripper suffocates dude with thighs"?

106
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,210
The other thing.

107
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,180
Right,the guy that walks into the E.R.

108
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,040
And kneels over dead.

109
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,060
His stomach's ripped out.

110
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,070
His liver,actually.

111
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,300
Anyways,I just found out something 
pretty damn interesting.

112
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,140
What?

113
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,520
The dead body covered in bloody 
fingerprints ... not the victim'S.

114
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,030
Okay,great.My man dave caruso 
will be stoked to hear it.

115
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:49,050
Those fingerprints match 
a guy who died in 1981.

116
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,670
Really?

117
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,520
So,what are we talking?

118
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,780
Uh,walking dead?

119
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,980
Walking,killing dead?

120
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,350
Maybe.

121
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,480
Zombies do like the other other white meat.

122
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,430
Speaking of,what do you care about zombies?

123
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,030
What do you mean?

124
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,980
Well,you've been on soul-saving 
detail for months now.

125
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,240
And we're three weeks out,
and all of a sudden,

126
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,490
you're interested in some hot zombie action?

127
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,430
Hey,man,you're the one 
who's been all gung ho to hunt.

128
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,090
I just thought I'd be doing you a favor.

129
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,330
Hey,no,no,no,no,no.

130
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,700
I didn't say I didn't want to do it,okay.

131
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,640
I mean,obviously,I want to hunt some zombies.

132
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,220
Okay,fine,whatever.

133
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,970
Yeah,the rest of the body was intact.

134
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,040
The liver was the only organ missing.

135
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,830
Now,where the liver was ripped out,
did you happen to notice any teeth marks?

136
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,900
Can I see your badges?

137
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,300
Of course,sure.

138
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,950
Fine.

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,670
So you're cops and morons.

140
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,860
Excuse me?No,no.We're very smart.

141
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,300
The liver was not ripped out.

142
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,490
It was removed ... surgically ...

143
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,160
by someone who knew their way around a scalpel.

144
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,450
Didn't you read my report?

145
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,640
Of course we did.

146
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,080
Oh,it was riveting.

147
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,990
It was a real page-turner,st delightful.

148
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,350
You done?

149
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,340
- I think so.
- Please go away.

150
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,250
- Okay.
- Sure.

151
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,300
- What?
- Nothing.

152
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,300
So,that kind of punches a 
hole in our zombie theory,

153
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,600
huh,that scalpel thing?

154
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,900
Yeah,zombie with skills.

155
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,450
"Dr.Quinn,medicine zombie."

156
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:38,430
Maybe we're on the wrong track,dean,
looking for hacked-up corpses.

157
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,010
What should we be looking for?

158
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,220
Survivors.

159
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,530
This isn't zombie lunch.

160
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,210
This is organ theft.

161
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,350
I told the cops all of this yesterday.

162
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,160
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

163
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,940
It's just a couple of questions,sir.

164
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,620
Hey,man.

165
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,180
I just got my kidney stolen.

166
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,890
I'm tired.

167
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,040
We'll be out of here quick.

168
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,490
Don't you want to get the guy?

169
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,660
Will it get me back my kidney?

170
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,010
Sir,what's the last thing you remember?

171
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,910
Feeding my meter.

172
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,730
Jumped from behind.

173
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,470
and then I wake up strapped to a table.

174
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:19,100
And then the worst pain you could 
possibly imagine,only worse.

175
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,970
And then I black out 
again ... thank god.

176
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:29,560
And then I wake up screaming in some 
no-tell motel in a bathtub full of ice.

177
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,970
Do you remember anything 
about the surgery ...

178
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,740
you know,what the guy looked like,
any details about the room?

179
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,600
Let me think about that.

180
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,490
Yeah.

181
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,620
one thing is coming back to me.

182
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,880
You know what I remember?

183
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,830
Getting my kidney cut out of my body!

184
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,750
- So,I got a theory.
- Yeah?

185
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,840
Yeah,I talked to mr.Giggle's doctor.

186
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,800
Turns out his incisions 
were sewn up with silk.

187
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,650
That's weird.

188
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,720
Yeah,nowadays it is,

189
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,390
but silk used to be the suture of 
choice back in the early 19th century.

190
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,720
It was really problematic.

191
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,530
Patients would get massive infections.

192
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,740
The death rate was insane.

193
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,370
Good times.

194
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,440
Right,so doctors,

195
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,330
they had to do whatever they could to 
keep infections from spreading.

196
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,450
One way was maggots.

197
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,370
Dude,I'm eating.

198
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,740
It actually kind of worked because maggots ...

199
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,120
they eat bad tissue,
and they leave good tissue.

200
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,780
And get this ... 
when they found our guy,

201
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,060
his body cavity was stuffed full of maggots.

202
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,370
Dude,I'm eating.

203
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,930
All right,let me get this straight.

204
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,350
So,people are getting ganked,

205
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,960
- right?
- Yeah.

206
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,560
A little "antiques roadshow" 
surgery,some organ theft.

207
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,970
But why does this all sound familiar?

208
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,630
Because you heard it before ... 
when you were a kid.

209
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,020
from dad.

210
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,640
Doc benton ... real-life doctor,
lived in new hampshire.

211
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:48,060
Brilliant and obsessed with alchemy,
especially how to live forever.

212
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,530
So,in 1816,doc abandons his practice and ...

213
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,900
right,yeah,nobody hears 
from him for like 20 years,

214
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,490
and all of sudden,
people start showing up dead.

215
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,970
Dead or missing an organ or 
a hand or some other kind of part.

216
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,830
'Cause whatever he was 
doing was actually working.

217
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,850
He just kept on ticking.

218
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,950
Parts would wear out,he'd replace them.

219
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,180
But I thought dad hunted him 
down and took his heart out.

220
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,950
Yeah,I guess the doc must 
have plugged in a new one.

221
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,090
All right,where's he doing the deed?

222
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,890
According to this,benton's picky 
about where he sets up his lab.

223
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,100
He likes dense forest with access 
to a river or stream 

224
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,010
- or some kind of freshwater.
- Why?

225
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:26,060
Because that's where he likes to dump the 
bile and intestines and fecal matter.

226
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,080
Lost your appetite yet?

227
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,450
Oh,baby,I can't stay mad at you.

228
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,940
These are all old hunting cabins.

229
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,900
They've mostly been abandoned for years.

230
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,500
What the hell are we waiting for?

231
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,420
- Bobby.
- Hey.

232
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,600
Think I finally got a bead on bela.

233
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,770
I'm listening.

234
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,240
Rufus turner.

235
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,270
Is that,like,a cleveland steamer?

236
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,180
He's a hunter,or used to be.

237
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,320
And now?

238
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,460
Hermit,mostly.

239
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,690
Does a little selling on the side.

240
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:17,190
Anyway,I put the word 
out on bela months ago.

241
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,480
He just called.

242
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,760
Said a woman got in touch,
wanted to buy some things.

243
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,830
And he thinks it's bela?

244
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,460
British accent,
went by the name mina chandler.

245
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,470
She's used that before.

246
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,050
Well,that's kind of a sloppy move,isn't it ...

247
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,710
getting in contact with 
one of your old friends?

248
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,570
Friend?

249
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,980
Haven't laid eyes on him in 15 years.

250
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,360
He's not the christmas-card type.

251
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,670
I doubt she knows I know him.

252
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,220
Canaan,vermont.

253
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,650
Thanks,bobby.We're on our way.

254
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,510
One other thing ... 
take a bottle of johnnie walker blue.

255
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,820
Okay.

256
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,870
Come on,we're going after bela.

257
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,390
What?Whoa,whoa,whoa,hold on a second.

258
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,710
Come on,get your stuff.Clock's ticking.

259
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,730
I-I think we should stay 
here and finish the case.

260
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:55,700
Are you insane?

261
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,010
Dean,there's no way she still has the colt.

262
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,670
That was months ago.

263
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,120
She probably sold it the second she got it.

264
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:01,840
Then I'll kill her ... win-win.

265
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,050
- Dean ...
- sam,we're going.

266
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,330
No.

267
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,260
Why the hell not?

268
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,460
Dean,this ... this here,now ... 
this is what's gonna save you.

269
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,220
What,chasing some frankenstein?

270
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,650
Chasing immortality.

271
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,090
Look,benton can't die.

272
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,400
We find out how he did it,we can do it to you.

273
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,280
What are you talking about?

274
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,080
You have to die before you go to hell,right?

275
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,120
So,if you can never die ... 

276
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,070
wait.Wait.Wait.Wait a second.

277
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,760
Did ... did you know that this 
was doc benton from the jump?

278
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,310
No.

279
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,060
Look,I was hoping ... 

280
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,110
so,the whole zombie thing,
you were just lying to me?

281
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,780
I didn't want to say anything 
until I was sure,dean.

282
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,470
All I'm trying to do 
is find an answer here.

283
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,370
No,all you're trying to do 
is chase slicey mchacky here.

284
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,150
And to kill him?

285
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,650
No,you want to buy him a freakin' beer.

286
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,950
You want to study him.

287
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:49,880
I was just trying to help.

288
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,660
Well,you're not helping.

289
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,070
You forget that 
if I welch on this deal,you die.

290
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,610
Guess what ... living forever is welching.

291
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,800
Then whatever the magic 
pill is,I'll take it,too.

292
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,210
Aw,what is this,"sid & nancy"?

293
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,170
No,it's just like bobby's been saying.

294
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,230
We kill the demon that holds the contract,
and this whole damn thing wipes clean.

295
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,450
That's our best shot.

296
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,260
Even if you had the colt,dean,
who are you gonna shoot?

297
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,800
We have no idea who holds the ticket.

298
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,190
Well,I'll shoot the hellhounds,then,
before they slash me up!

299
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,310
Now,are you coming or not?

300
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,900
I'm staying here.

301
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,740
No,you're not.

302
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,600
'cause I'm not gonna let you wander out in the 
woods alone to track some organ-stealing freak.

303
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,420
You're not gonna let me?

304
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,300
No,I'm not gonna let you.

305
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,620
How are you gonna stop me?

306
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,330
Look,man.

307
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,330
we're trying to do the same thing here.

308
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,240
I know.

309
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,150
But I'm going.

310
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,050
So,if you want to stay.

311
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,280
stay.

312
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,880
Sammy,be careful.

313
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,120
You too.

314
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,440
What?

315
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,280
Hi,uh,uh,rufus?

316
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,080
Yeah,even if I am,the question 
is still the same ... what?

317
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,100
Uh,I'm dean winchester.

318
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,320
I'm a friend of bobby singer'S.

319
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,510
So?

320
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,480
You called him this morning.

321
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,180
So?

322
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,640
Uh You told bobby about a british 
chick who made contact with you.

323
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,240
And so?

324
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,450
You know where she is?

325
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,980
- Yeah.
- Great.

326
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,980
Could you tell me where I could find her?

327
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,460
No.

328
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,590
Course not.

329
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,440
Look,rufus,man.

330
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,370
Look,let me point something out to you.

331
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,850
You are knocking at my door,
so don't "look,man" me.

332
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,800
I'm not your man.

333
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,560
I'm sorry,sir.

334
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,910
All right,I'm gonna tell you a little story.

335
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,420
See,once upon a time,bobby called me,

336
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,090
asked me to call him if I got 
a whiff of this bela talbot.

337
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,080
I got a whiff.

338
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:31,830
I called.

339
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,010
The end.

340
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,670
Okay,yeah,if you could just 
tell me where she is,

341
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:36,740
I mean,that would be great.

342
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,400
- Dean winchester,right?
- Yeah.

343
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:42,390
Dean,do I look like I'm here to help you?

344
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,100
I'm gonna say no.

345
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,830
Then get the hell off my property.

346
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,580
All right,hey,fair enough.

347
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,120
I got one more question for you,though.

348
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,530
See,I got this,
uh This bottle of scotch,and,uh.

349
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,920
is this considered good?

350
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,560
Well,bottoms up.

351
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:12,490
You know,I don't even bother 
drinking unless it's this stuff.

352
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,410
Nectar of the gods,I'm telling you.

353
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,010
Hey,it's a nice change,you know.

354
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,420
Most of my whiskey's from a plastic jug.

355
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,120
So,bela was here because.

356
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,150
she wanted to buy a couple of things,

357
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,790
which is gonna take me some time to round up.

358
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,840
Where is she now?

359
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:37,040
C-can I ask you something?

360
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,420
Sure.

361
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,470
You got three weeks left.

362
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,670
Why are you wasting your time 
chasing after that skinny,

363
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,460
stuck-up english girl?

364
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,940
How do you know about that?

365
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,320
Because I know things.

366
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:02,240
I know a lot of things 
about a lot of people.

367
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,410
Is that so?

368
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,320
I know ain't no peashooter gonna save you.

369
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,870
What makes you so sure?

370
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,950
'Cause that's the job,kid.

371
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,710
Even if you manage to scrape out of this one,

372
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,560
there's just gonna be 
something else down the road.

373
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,630
Folks like us.

374
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,890
there ain't no happy ending.

375
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,050
We all got it coming.

376
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,170
Well,ain't you a bucket of sunshine?

377
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,950
I'm what you've got to look 
forward to if you survive.

378
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,420
But you won'T.

379
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,730
So,bela.

380
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,320
hotel canaan.

381
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,770
Room 39.

382
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,560
But watch your back.

383
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,230
I think I can handle bela.

384
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,710
Oh,don't be so sure about that.

385
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,710
There are things that 
you don't know about her.

386
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,500
Oh,and you do?

387
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,080
Right.

388
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,420
Because you know things.

389
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,420
Yep.

390
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,720
And let me guess ... 
you lift her fingerprint?

391
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,260
Yep.

392
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,130
And that got you jack.

393
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,530
Yep.

394
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,030
She burned them off.

395
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,090
Probably years ago.

396
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,090
Yeah,so you're right where we are.

397
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,820
Nope.

398
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,900
You do her ear?

399
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,260
Sorry?

400
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,530
You do her ear?

401
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,140
Hey,man,I'll try anything once,
but I don't know.

402
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,410
That sounds uncomfortable.

403
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,950
Ears are as unique to 
humans as fingerprints.

404
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,860
No kidding.

405
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,120
Of course,that don't fly 
in the courts over here,

406
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:47,130
but in england,they're all over it.

407
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,760
A friend of a friend.

408
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:58,350
of a friend faxed me 10 pages of 
confidential files within a day.

409
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:03,860
All I had to send him was one clean 
shot off the security camera.

410
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,080
Right.

411
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,990
One clean shot of her ear.

412
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,100
The so-called bela talbot.

413
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,190
It's okay.I'm here to help you.

414
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,950
I'm here to help you.

415
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,050
I'm here to help you.

416
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,580
I'm sorry.I'm sorry.

417
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,400
Sorry.

418
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,780
Try to get straight.Try to get straight.

419
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,960
- Where's the colt?
- Dean.

420
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,190
No extra words.

421
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,040
It's long gone ... across the world by now.

422
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,900
You're lying.

423
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,740
I'll call the buyer.

424
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,950
Speak farsi?

425
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:30,920
- Now,look ...
- don't flatter yourself.

426
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:33,910
Don't move.

427
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,760
I toldi ou don't have it.

428
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,650
Oh,yeah,I'm definitely 
gonna take your word for it.

429
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,690
Don't move.

430
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,450
It's gone.

431
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:05,150
Get on a plane if you must.

432
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:08,370
Track down the buyer.

433
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,800
You might catch up to him eventually.

434
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,570
Are you going to kill me?

435
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,580
Oh,yeah.

436
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,230
You're not the cold-blooded type.

437
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,100
You mean like you?

438
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,540
That's true.

439
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:29,110
See,I couldn't imagine killing my parents.

440
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,190
- I don't know what you're talking ...
- yes,you do.

441
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,910
You were,what,14?

442
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,220
Folks died in some shady car accident.

443
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:43,140
Police suspected a slashed brake line,
but it was all too crispy to tell.

444
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:49,640
Cut to little bela ... oh,I'm sorry,
abby ... inheriting millions.

445
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,750
- How did you ev...
- doesn't matter.

446
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,040
They were lovely people.

447
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,220
And I killed them.

448
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,510
And I got rich.

449
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,960
I can't be bothered to give a damn.

450
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,880
Just like I don't care what happens to you.

451
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,490
You make me sick.

452
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,870
Likewise.

453
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,080
You're not worth it.

454
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,290
It worked.

455
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,970
He found me.

456
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,030
No,sam wasn't with him.

457
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,730
But I know where they are.

458
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,150
- Dean?
- Yeah.

459
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,440
Did you get the colt?

460
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,350
What do you think?

461
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,920
So,does that mean bela is.

462
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:05,430
no,no,she deserves to die a dozen 
times over,but I couldn't do it.

463
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,410
- Dean.
- I'm really screwed,sammy.

464
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,980
= No,you're just ...
- but you were right.

465
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,470
Bela was a goose chase.

466
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:16,170
The colt's gone,and this 
timeI'm really screwed,sam.

467
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,070
Maybe not.

468
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,960
Look,I found benton's cabin.

469
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,650
- You okay?Was he there?
- Yeah.

470
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,150
- Did you kill him?
- No.

471
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,900
What do you mean,"no"?

472
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,300
Dean,please just listen for a second.

473
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:28,150
I found his lab book,
and it has the formula.

474
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,330
- What,the live-forever formula?
- Yeah.

475
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,110
Great,let me guess.

476
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,320
I got to drink blood out of a baby's skull?

477
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:36,210
No,that's the thing ... 
it's not black magic.

478
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,640
There's no blood sacrifice or anything.

479
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:41,920
It ... it's just science,dean.

480
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,960
Very,very extremely weird science,but.

481
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,830
wait,wait,wait.What are ... 
what are you saying?You think.

482
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,420
dean,I think it might be doable.

483
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,760
I mean,I know we've hit a lot of walls,

484
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,370
but I-I think this formula ...

485
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,770
I think it might be it.

486
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,080
This could save you.

487
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,740
Okay,so,this formula.

488
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,520
well,I mean,look,look,
we're not in the clear yet.

489
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,730
There are still things that I don't get.

490
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,690
Sam?

491
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,680
Sammy!

492
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,380
Hey.

493
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,410
You can relax.

494
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,980
It's all gonna be okay.

495
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:27,720
Ain't nothing gonna happen here 
that you got to worry about,sammy.

496
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:34,260
Your chances of coming out of this 
procedure alive ... very,very high.

497
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,340
How do you know my name?

498
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,510
I know.

499
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:47,240
You think I'm some kind 
of monster,don't you?

500
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:53,160
Well,I got to tell you,I have never done 
one thing that I did not have to do.

501
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:58,610
This whole eternal-life thing 
is very high-maintenance.

502
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:07,820
If something goes bad ... like my 
eyes here ... you got to replace them.

503
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:17,560
And sometimes things get damaged,
like when your father cut out my heart.

504
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:23,430
Now,that ... that was very inconvenient.

505
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,430
So,I'm sure that you can 
understand all the joy I felt

506
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,570
when I read all about 
myself here in his journal.

507
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:51,240
Kind of makes this whole thing just feel like 
some kind of family reunion,don't it?

508
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:58,210
Well,I guess it's about time 
that we get this thing started.

509
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,450
Shoot all you want.

510
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,280
A knife?

511
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:46,510
What part of immortality 
do you not understand?

512
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,280
Pity about the heart,though.

513
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:55,530
It was a brand-new one.

514
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,050
Good.

515
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,930
It should be pumping nice and strong.

516
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:05,220
sending this stuff throughout your whole body.

517
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:10,640
See,I picked up your little bottle 
upstairs and dipped the knife in it.

518
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,440
Oh,hiya,doc.

519
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:30,030
Wakey,wakey,eggs and bac-Y.

520
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,360
- Please.
- Please what?

521
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:36,770
You've been killing poor bastards for over 
150 years and now you got a request?

522
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,390
- Shut up.
- No,you don't understand.

523
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,330
I can help you.

524
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,200
I know what you need.

525
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,770
We might have to cut him up into little bits.

526
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,870
You know,this immortality thing is a bitch.

527
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,980
I can read the formula for you.

528
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:57,940
The whole immortality ... 
forever young,never die.

529
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,700
Dean.

530
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,300
Sam.

531
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,150
What?

532
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,110
I mean,we're talking hell in three weeks.

533
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,160
Or needing a new pancreas 
in like half a century.

534
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,950
Yeah,well,you can't exactly get 
those at a kwik-e-mart.

535
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,810
It's not perfect,but it buys us more time 
to think of something better.

536
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,920
We just need time,dean.

537
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:31,920
I mean,please,just ... just think about it.

538
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,500
No.

539
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,710
Dean,don't you want to live?

540
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,740
What he is isn't living.

541
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,220
- Look,this is simple.
- Simple?

542
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,210
To me it is,okay.

543
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,230
Black or white ... human,not human.

544
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:48,300
See,what the doc is is a freakin' monster.

545
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,320
I can't do it.

546
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,990
I would rather go to hell.

547
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,270
You don't understand.

548
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,460
I can help you!

549
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,110
Now,I'm gonna take care of him.

550
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,160
You can help me or not.

551
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,050
It's up to you.

552
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,000
Enjoy forever in there,doc.

553
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:08,730
No!

554
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,500
Hiya,bela.

555
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,840
Here's a fun fact you may not know ... 

556
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:15,150
I felt your hand in my pocket 
when you swiped that motel receipt.

557
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,410
You don't understand.

558
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,870
Oh,I'm pretty sure I understand perfectly.

559
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,470
You see,I noticed something 
interesting in your hotel room,

560
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,270
something tucked above the door.

561
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,940
An herb ... devil's shoestring.

562
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:29,000
Well,there's only one use for that ... 

563
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:31,420
holding hellhounds at bay.

564
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,420
So,you know what I did?

565
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,570
I went back,and I took another 
look at your folks' obit.

566
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,130
Turns out they died 10 years ago today.

567
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,060
You didn't kill them.

568
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,930
A demon did your dirty work.

569
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:45,400
You made a deal,didn't you,bela?

570
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,480
And it's come due.

571
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,560
I can take care of them for you.

572
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,300
And it won't even cost you anything.

573
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:06,180
For 10 whole years.

574
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,630
Is that why you stole the colt,huh?

575
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,000
To try to wiggle out of your deal?

576
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,630
Our gun for your soul?

577
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,680
Yes.

578
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,370
But stealing the colt wasn't 
quite enough,I'm guessing.

579
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,370
They changed the deal.

580
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,970
They wanted me to kill sam.

581
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:25,710
Really?

582
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,200
Demons untrustworthy ... Shocker.

583
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,530
That's kind of a tight deadline,too.

584
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:33,950
What time is it?

585
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,640
Oh,look at that.

586
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,470
Almost midnight.

587
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,860
Dean,listen,I need help.

588
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,430
Sweetheart,we are weeks past help.

589
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,070
I know I don't deserve it.

590
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,220
You know what?You're right.You don'T.

591
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,000
But you know what the 
bitch of the bunch is?

592
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:49,170
If you would have just come to 
us sooner and asked for help,

593
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:51,830
we probably could have taken 
the colt and saved you.

594
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:54,670
I know,and saved yourself.

595
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,630
I know about your deal,dean.

596
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,880
And who told you that?

597
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,520
The demon that holds it.

598
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,630
She holds mine,too.

599
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,390
She says she holds every deal.

600
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,130
She?

601
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,720
Her name's lilith.

602
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,630
Lilith?

603
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,990
Why should I believe you?

604
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,460
You shouldn't,but it's the truth.

605
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,190
This can't help you,bela.Not now.

606
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,810
Why are you telling me this?

607
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,240
Because just maybe you can kill the bitch.

608
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,080
I'll see you in hell.
