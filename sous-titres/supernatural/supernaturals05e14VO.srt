1
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:04,503
These omens,
they're prelude to what?

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,672
- The horsemen
- Which one rides the red horse?

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,008
- War.
- You can't kill war, kiddos!

4
00:00:09,527 --> 00:00:10,527
We know.

5
00:00:10,652 --> 00:00:11,969
- The ring.
- The ring.

6
00:00:14,463 --> 00:00:15,932
You can't stop thinking about it.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,392
Ever since you saw it dripping off
that knife.

8
00:00:18,671 --> 00:00:21,562
Blood, blood, blood.

9
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,522
I'm not some junkie!

10
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,983
I think that
the "Dean and Sam" story sucks!

11
00:00:27,108 --> 00:00:29,487
It is not fun.
It's not entertaining.

12
00:00:29,752 --> 00:00:31,302
It is a river of crap

13
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:34,075
that would send most people
howling to the nuthouse!

14
00:00:34,953 --> 00:00:37,139
- How many people do you have to save?
- All of 'em.

15
00:00:37,264 --> 00:00:38,743
How do you get up in the morning?

16
00:00:38,868 --> 00:00:41,207
That's a good question.
I'm just tired, man.

17
00:00:41,544 --> 00:00:42,694
And I'm done.

18
00:00:43,926 --> 00:00:45,127
I am just done.

19
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:04,501
First date.

20
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:07,984
I had a really good time tonight,
Russell.

21
00:01:15,353 --> 00:01:17,653
Can I see you again?
Sunday, maybe?

22
00:01:19,669 --> 00:01:22,769
I just don't want to be alone
on Valentine's day...

23
00:01:23,596 --> 00:01:24,596
Again.

24
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:27,381
I know what you mean.

25
00:01:45,281 --> 00:01:46,397
I'm sorry, I just...

26
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,511
I don't want you to think
I'm the type of person who...

27
00:01:49,636 --> 00:01:51,386
No, I should apologize...

28
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
Oh, God.

29
00:02:07,264 --> 00:02:09,032
I respect the crap
out of you right now.

30
00:02:09,157 --> 00:02:10,157
Shut up!

31
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:21,390
Your neck!
I think I bit you.

32
00:02:23,138 --> 00:02:25,270
It's okay.
It's good.

33
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,905
I've been so alone.
So empty...

34
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,740
I know. Me too.

35
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,326
I want you...

36
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,827
All of you...

37
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,871
- Inside me...
- Yes.

38
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,325
= 514 =

39
00:03:09,587 --> 00:03:12,483
= Supernatural Team =

40
00:03:18,455 --> 00:03:19,455
So...

41
00:03:19,643 --> 00:03:21,193
You found the bodies?

42
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:24,499
There was blood everywhere.

43
00:03:24,624 --> 00:03:26,864
And... Other stuff...

44
00:03:29,104 --> 00:03:30,725
I think Alice was already dead.

45
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,304
But Russell wasn't?

46
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,358
I think he was, mostly.

47
00:03:36,852 --> 00:03:37,852
Except...

48
00:03:38,473 --> 00:03:40,123
He was still sort of...

49
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:43,055
Chewing a little.

50
00:03:50,075 --> 00:03:52,273
How could two people even do that...

51
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,605
- Eat each other to death?
- That's a really good question.

52
00:03:56,308 --> 00:03:59,655
Now, the last few days,
did you notice her acting erratically?

53
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,512
- How do you mean?
- I mean, did she seem...

54
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:04,637
Unusually hostile, aggressive?

55
00:04:05,457 --> 00:04:06,457
No way.

56
00:04:06,823 --> 00:04:09,447
Alice never drank, never even swore.

57
00:04:10,074 --> 00:04:11,574
She was a nice girl.

58
00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:14,003
And I'm talking, like,
a nice girl...

59
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:17,381
Like she still had her promise ring,
if you know what I mean.

60
00:04:18,054 --> 00:04:19,800
- She was a virgin?
- No premarital.

61
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:22,516
I used to wonder how she did it.

62
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:25,316
I mean, you know, didn't do it.

63
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:32,647
It was her first date in months.

64
00:04:34,277 --> 00:04:35,727
She was so excited.

65
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:39,945
Apparently,
they were both pretty excited.

66
00:04:45,758 --> 00:04:46,858
How'd it go?

67
00:04:48,108 --> 00:04:49,622
No EMF, no sulfur.

68
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:53,834
Ghost possession and demonic possession
are both probably out.

69
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:56,545
- That's where I was puttin' my money.
- Nope.

70
00:04:57,283 --> 00:04:58,333
What, then?

71
00:04:58,915 --> 00:05:00,508
Dude! At the coroner's...

72
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:02,760
You didn't see these bodies.

73
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,928
I mean, these two started eating
and they just...

74
00:05:06,608 --> 00:05:07,658
Kept going.

75
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,850
Their stomachs were full.

76
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,168
Like... Thanksgiving-dinner full.

77
00:05:12,992 --> 00:05:14,272
Talk about co-dependent.

78
00:05:17,153 --> 00:05:18,803
We got our feelers out.

79
00:05:19,268 --> 00:05:21,037
Not much more we can do tonight.

80
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:25,040
All right.
I'm just gonna go through some files.

81
00:05:25,165 --> 00:05:26,784
You can go ahead and get going.

82
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:28,662
Sorry?

83
00:05:29,048 --> 00:05:30,705
Go ahead. Unleash the kraken.

84
00:05:31,201 --> 00:05:32,551
See you tomorrow.

85
00:05:34,195 --> 00:05:36,377
- Where am I going?
- Dean, it's Valentine's day.

86
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:39,880
Your favorite holiday, remember?
What do you always call it...

87
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,998
Unattached drifter Christmas?

88
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,412
Be that as it may...

89
00:05:48,002 --> 00:05:49,152
I don't know.

90
00:05:50,623 --> 00:05:52,335
Guess I'm not feeling it this year.

91
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,479
So you're not into bars
full of lonely women?

92
00:05:57,592 --> 00:05:58,692
I guess not.

93
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,678
- What?
- It's when a dog doesn't eat...

94
00:06:04,318 --> 00:06:05,906
You know something's wrong.

95
00:06:07,397 --> 00:06:09,820
Remarkably patronizing concern.
Duly noted.

96
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:11,045
Nothing's wrong.

97
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,705
We gonna work or what?

98
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,234
No me gusta.

99
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:27,970
- Have you been proofing this, Jimbo?
- Sorry?

100
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:31,161
Tell me you are not checking
your cellphone again!

101
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:33,548
She's got you on a leash.

102
00:06:33,673 --> 00:06:35,645
I'm not.
She just wants to know where I am.

103
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:37,591
She wants to know
that you're whipped.

104
00:06:37,716 --> 00:06:39,626
- It's not like that.
- It's like...

105
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:43,110
- Brad, just give me two minutes.
- No, man. No.

106
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,941
I'm the project leader on this,

107
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:48,604
and I'm not gonna half-ass it
'cause my wingman has gone mental

108
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:50,534
over some chick he meta week ago.

109
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:52,787
Jim?

110
00:06:54,712 --> 00:06:55,712
Holy crap.

111
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,459
Where were you?

112
00:06:59,494 --> 00:07:01,462
I know. It's just I had to...

113
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,466
You can't choose work over me, Jim!

114
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:07,082
I won't, Janice.

115
00:07:07,724 --> 00:07:08,824
I'm sorry...

116
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:12,218
Jimbo, due respect,
but honestly, bro...

117
00:07:17,044 --> 00:07:19,397
- What are we gonna do, Jimmy?
- I don't know, baby.

118
00:07:19,892 --> 00:07:21,399
Seems like whatever we do,

119
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,859
something in life is always
gonna keep us apart...

120
00:07:24,355 --> 00:07:27,113
Work, family, sleep.

121
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:29,407
Now prison, maybe...

122
00:07:31,805 --> 00:07:32,805
Maybe.

123
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,420
I have an idea.

124
00:07:38,386 --> 00:07:40,236
How we can stay together...

125
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,877
Forever...

126
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,040
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

127
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:31,510
Agent Marley,
you just can't stay away.

128
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:34,013
Heard you tagged
another double suicide.

129
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,778
- I've just closed them up.
- Dr. Corman, this is my partner.

130
00:08:36,903 --> 00:08:40,105
- Special agent Cliff.
- Agent Cliff. I've finished my prelims.

131
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:43,430
I pulled the organ sets
and sent off the tox samples.

132
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:48,149
- You mind if we take a look?
- Not at all. But like I said, their...

133
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:50,673
Good-and-plenties
are already tupperwared.

134
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,140
- Super.
- Leave the keys with Marty up front.

135
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,827
And please, gentlemen...

136
00:08:57,908 --> 00:08:59,808
Refrigerate after opening...

137
00:09:09,486 --> 00:09:10,786
Be my Valentine?

138
00:09:16,435 --> 00:09:17,635
Wait a second.

139
00:09:24,123 --> 00:09:26,274
These hearts
both have identical marks.

140
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:29,611
Check this out.

141
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,696
It looks like a letter.

142
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:37,064
What?

143
00:09:39,554 --> 00:09:41,154
I think it's enochian.

144
00:09:42,238 --> 00:09:44,005
You mean like angel scratches?

145
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,879
Like the tagging on our ribs?

146
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,339
Dean, I don't know.

147
00:09:57,606 --> 00:09:58,639
Cass, it's Dean.

148
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:02,799
Room 31-c, basement level,
St. James medical center.

149
00:10:03,942 --> 00:10:05,142
I'm there now.

150
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,020
I get that.

151
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:09,150
I'm gonna hang up now.

152
00:10:10,071 --> 00:10:11,071
Right.

153
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,336
You're right, Sam.
These are angelic marks.

154
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:22,930
You'll find similar marks
on the other couples as well.

155
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,999
What are they? what do they mean?

156
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,717
It's a mark of union.

157
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:29,731
This man and woman
were intended to mate.

158
00:10:29,856 --> 00:10:31,506
But who put them there?

159
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,616
Your people call them Cupid.

160
00:10:35,141 --> 00:10:36,141
A what?

161
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,426
What human myth
has mistaken for Cupid

162
00:10:40,551 --> 00:10:42,801
is actually a lower order of angel.

163
00:10:43,372 --> 00:10:45,353
Technically it's a cherub,
third-class.

164
00:10:45,868 --> 00:10:48,262
- Cherub?
- Yeah, they're all over the world.

165
00:10:48,387 --> 00:10:49,830
There are dozens of them.

166
00:10:49,955 --> 00:10:52,401
You mean the little flying
fat kid in diapers?

167
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:55,493
They're not incontinent.

168
00:10:55,727 --> 00:10:57,542
Anyway. So, What you're saying...

169
00:10:57,667 --> 00:11:00,159
What I'm saying is
a cupid has gone rogue.

170
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:03,204
And we have to stop him.
Before he kills again.

171
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,790
Naturally.

172
00:11:06,747 --> 00:11:08,047
Of course we do.

173
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,395
You just happen to know
he likes the cosmos at this place?

174
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:29,718
This place is a nexus
of human reproduction.

175
00:11:29,843 --> 00:11:31,693
It's exactly the kind of...

176
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:36,153
Garden the cupid will come
to pollinate.

177
00:11:43,194 --> 00:11:44,394
Wait a minute.

178
00:11:44,926 --> 00:11:46,326
You're not hungry?

179
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:52,399
- What? I'm not hungry.
- You're not gonna finish that?

180
00:11:59,582 --> 00:12:00,582
He's here.

181
00:12:02,337 --> 00:12:04,047
- Where?
- I don't see anything.

182
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,024
There.

183
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:17,486
The same-side-of-the-booth
couple over there?

184
00:12:17,842 --> 00:12:19,342
Meet me in the back.

185
00:12:28,673 --> 00:12:32,126
- Cass, where is he?
- I have him tethered.

186
00:12:33,756 --> 00:12:37,381
Zoda kama mahrana.

187
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:39,467
Manifest yourself.

188
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,730
So, where is he?

189
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:50,811
Here I am!

190
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,026


191
00:13:01,942 --> 00:13:04,374
- Help!
- Help is on the way.

192
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:05,549
Yes, it is.

193
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:08,717
Hello, you!

194
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:16,295
- This is Cupid?
- Yes.

195
00:13:17,468 --> 00:13:18,631
And look at you?

196
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,950
- Is this a fight? Are we in a fight?
- This is their handshake.

197
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,094
- I don't like it.
- No one does.

198
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:36,983
What can I do for you?

199
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,110
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

200
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,154
Your targets. The ones you've marked.
They're slaughtering each other.

201
00:13:43,993 --> 00:13:44,993
What?

202
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,076
They are?

203
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:49,294
Listen, birthday suit, we know.

204
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,374
You been flittin' around,
popping people with your poison arrow,

205
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,835
- making them murder each other!
- We don't know why.

206
00:13:58,203 --> 00:13:59,653
You think that I...

207
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,480
I don't know what to say.

208
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:23,112
- Should somebody maybe go talk to him?
- Good idea, give 'em hell, Cass.

209
00:14:35,385 --> 00:14:36,885
We didn't mean to...

210
00:14:42,824 --> 00:14:44,258
Hurt your feelings.

211
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:47,567
Love is more than a word to me.

212
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,599
I love love. I love it!
If that's wrong, I don't wanna be right!

213
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:54,727
Of course.

214
00:14:57,026 --> 00:15:01,030
- I have no idea what you're saying.
- I was just on my appointed rounds.

215
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,694
What my targets do after that,
it's nothing to do with me.

216
00:15:04,535 --> 00:15:06,335
I was following my orders.

217
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,284
Please, brother.
Read my mind.

218
00:15:11,168 --> 00:15:12,787
Read my mind, you'll see.

219
00:15:21,404 --> 00:15:24,257
- He's telling the truth.
- Jiminy Christmas, thank you.

220
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,301
Wait, you said
you were just following orders?

221
00:15:28,342 --> 00:15:29,492
Whose orders?

222
00:15:31,332 --> 00:15:33,599
Heaven, silly. Heaven.

223
00:15:34,742 --> 00:15:37,200
Why does heaven care
if Harry meets Sally?

224
00:15:37,325 --> 00:15:40,398
Mostly they don't.
Certain bloodlines, certain destinies.

225
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,149
- Like yours.
- What?

226
00:15:42,605 --> 00:15:44,673
The union
of John and Mary Winchester...

227
00:15:44,798 --> 00:15:47,571
Very big deal upstairs,
top priority arrangement.

228
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:51,171
- You fixed-up our parents?
- Well, not me, but...

229
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:55,434
It wasn't easy, either.
They couldn't stand each other.

230
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:57,498
When we were done with them,
perfect couple.

231
00:15:57,904 --> 00:15:58,904
Perfect?

232
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,126
They're dead!

233
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:03,006
I'm sorry, but...

234
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:06,829
The orders were very clear.
You and Sam need to be born.

235
00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:09,176
Your parents were just...

236
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:10,749
Meant to be.

237
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,921
A match made in heaven, heaven!

238
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,310
Son of a bitch!

239
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,280
Where is he? Where'd he go?

240
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:25,067
I believe you upset him.

241
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,035
- Upset him?
- Dean. Enough!

242
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:32,491
- You just punched a Cupid!
- I punched a dick!

243
00:16:35,248 --> 00:16:38,083
Are we gonna talk about
what's been up with you lately or not?

244
00:16:39,977 --> 00:16:40,977
Or not.

245
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:56,669
You wanted to hear
about any other weird ones.

246
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,174
Lester Finch.

247
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,600
Pulled his records.

248
00:17:09,222 --> 00:17:11,516
This gentleman
used to weigh 400 pounds or so,

249
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:15,191
till he got a gastric bypass,
which brought down his weight.

250
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:19,119
But then for some reason,
last night, he decided to go

251
00:17:19,967 --> 00:17:21,417
on a Twinkie binge.

252
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,627
So, he died from a Twinkie binge?

253
00:17:26,118 --> 00:17:28,172
After he blew out the band
around his stomach,

254
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:30,537
he filled it up till it burst.

255
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:33,181
When he could no longer swallow,

256
00:17:33,306 --> 00:17:36,556
he started jamming the cakes
down his gullet with a...

257
00:17:37,915 --> 00:17:39,415
With a toilet brush.

258
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,859
Like he was ramrodding a cannon.

259
00:17:45,717 --> 00:17:47,567
So, what do you make of it?

260
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,033
I'd say
that it was a very peculiar thing to do.

261
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,071
So,
this guy was not marked by Cupid,

262
00:17:57,196 --> 00:17:59,233
but his death
is definitely suspicious.

263
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:03,282
I just went through the police blotter,
and counting him, that's eight suicides

264
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:05,633
since Wednesday and 19 ODs.

265
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:07,753
Way out of the average.

266
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,268
If there's a pattern here,
it ain't just love.

267
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:12,003
It's bigger than we thought.

268
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:13,875
See you in 10.

269
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:49,578
I know what you are, damn it.

270
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,341
I could smell you.

271
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:33,661
What does a demon
got to do with this, anyway?

272
00:19:33,786 --> 00:19:35,299
Believe me, I got no idea.

273
00:19:38,338 --> 00:19:39,338
You okay?

274
00:19:41,727 --> 00:19:43,127
I'll be all right.

275
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:48,437
Let's crack her open.
What's the worst that could happen?

276
00:20:08,663 --> 00:20:10,960
- What was that?
- It's a human soul.

277
00:20:14,236 --> 00:20:16,136
It's starting to make sense.

278
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:20,094
- Now, what about that makes sense?
- When did you start eating?

279
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:23,222
Exactly. My hunger.
It's a clue, actually.

280
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,722
For what?

281
00:20:25,395 --> 00:20:28,780
This town is not suffering
from some love-gone-wrong effect.

282
00:20:28,905 --> 00:20:32,273
It's suffering from hunger.
Starvation, to be exact.

283
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:33,691
Specifically...

284
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:35,610
- Famine.
- Famine?

285
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,779
As in the horseman?

286
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:39,947
Great.

287
00:20:40,424 --> 00:20:41,574
That's great.

288
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,720
I thought famine meant starvation,

289
00:20:45,228 --> 00:20:47,121
like as in, you know, food.

290
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:48,981
Yes, absolutely.

291
00:20:49,324 --> 00:20:50,583
But not just food.

292
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:52,668
Everyone seems to be starving
for something.

293
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:54,837
Sex, attention,

294
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:56,672
drugs,

295
00:20:57,539 --> 00:20:59,791
- love.
- Well, that explains the puppy-lovers

296
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,232
that Cupid shot up.

297
00:21:01,357 --> 00:21:03,857
Right.
The cherub made them crave love,

298
00:21:03,982 --> 00:21:06,982
and then famine came,
and made them rabid for it.

299
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:09,194
But what about you?

300
00:21:09,487 --> 00:21:11,896
Since when do angels
secretly hunger for white castle?

301
00:21:14,113 --> 00:21:15,191
It's my vessel.

302
00:21:16,136 --> 00:21:17,136
Jimmy.

303
00:21:18,191 --> 00:21:19,191
His...

304
00:21:19,971 --> 00:21:23,421
appetite for red meat
has been touched by famine's effect.

305
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:27,995
So, famine just rolls into town
and everybody goes crazy?

306
00:21:30,713 --> 00:21:32,513
"And then will come famine

307
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:34,992
"riding on a black steed.

308
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:40,281
"He will ride
into the land of plenty.

309
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:02,881
"And great will be
the horseman's hunger,

310
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:04,515
"for he is hunger.

311
00:22:14,888 --> 00:22:17,738
"His hunger will seep out
and poison the air."

312
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:48,354
Hungry.

313
00:22:49,645 --> 00:22:50,945
Famine's hungry.

314
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:53,539
He must devour
the souls of his victims.

315
00:22:55,236 --> 00:22:57,249
That's what was in the briefcase.

316
00:22:57,374 --> 00:22:58,794
The Twinkie dude's soul?

317
00:23:01,864 --> 00:23:03,714
Lucifer has sent his demons

318
00:23:04,573 --> 00:23:06,673
to care for famine, to feed him,

319
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:08,258
make certain he'll be ready.

320
00:23:08,872 --> 00:23:09,972
Ready for what?

321
00:23:12,302 --> 00:23:14,052
To march across the land.

322
00:23:33,653 --> 00:23:34,653
Hungry.

323
00:23:37,564 --> 00:23:38,814
Sam Winchester.

324
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:40,961
The vessel. He's here.

325
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,699
- Where?
- At the hospital.

326
00:23:45,303 --> 00:23:46,303
We fought,

327
00:23:46,939 --> 00:23:48,239
but he got away.

328
00:23:50,877 --> 00:23:52,327
I got this off him.

329
00:23:53,503 --> 00:23:54,503
Good.

330
00:23:55,097 --> 00:23:56,097
Yes.

331
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,229
After lunch.

332
00:23:59,407 --> 00:24:01,167
Now, where is it?

333
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:03,609
Sorry?

334
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:07,052
The one who loves cream cake
so much.

335
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,241
Where is his soul?

336
00:24:15,612 --> 00:24:16,747
I am sorry, no.

337
00:24:17,952 --> 00:24:20,352
The Winchester
took the case from me.

338
00:24:21,537 --> 00:24:22,887
He had the knife.

339
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:28,433
I lost it.

340
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:30,594
But I'm hungry!

341
00:24:30,763 --> 00:24:33,264
I'll get another.
I won't be 10 minutes.

342
00:24:33,823 --> 00:24:34,823
Hungry!

343
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,250
Now!

344
00:24:56,878 --> 00:24:58,801
Delicious!

345
00:25:02,522 --> 00:25:03,522


346
00:25:14,501 --> 00:25:15,501
Famine?

347
00:25:18,477 --> 00:25:21,938
This whole town is just gonna eat,
drink, and screw itself to death?

348
00:25:22,536 --> 00:25:23,936
We should stop it.

349
00:25:24,514 --> 00:25:25,983
That's a great idea. How?

350
00:25:27,453 --> 00:25:29,153
How did you stop the last one?

351
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:34,483
War got his mojo from this ring.

352
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:39,497
After we cut it off,
he tucked tail and ran.

353
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:43,699
And everybody that was affected,
it was like they woke up out of a dream.

354
00:25:44,073 --> 00:25:46,796
- You think famine's got one, too?
- I know he does.

355
00:25:48,472 --> 00:25:50,466
Let's track him down
and get to chopping.

356
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:59,305
- What are you, the hamburglar?
- I've developed a taste for beef.

357
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:03,380
- Well, have you even tried to stop it?
- I can stop anytime I want.

358
00:26:03,927 --> 00:26:04,927
Whatever.

359
00:26:05,052 --> 00:26:06,352
Sam, let's roll.

360
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:13,659
I can't.

361
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,191
I can't go.

362
00:26:18,073 --> 00:26:19,238
What do you mean?

363
00:26:19,363 --> 00:26:20,913
I think it got to me.

364
00:26:22,783 --> 00:26:24,583
I think I'm hungry for it.

365
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:26,999
- For what?
- You know.

366
00:26:28,817 --> 00:26:29,917
Demon blood?

367
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,895
You got to be kidding me.

368
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,803
Get him out of here.
Beam him anywhere but here.

369
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:37,555
It won't work, he's infected.

370
00:26:37,723 --> 00:26:39,561
The hunger is gonna travel with him.

371
00:26:39,686 --> 00:26:40,886
What do we do?

372
00:26:41,011 --> 00:26:43,411
You go
cut that bastard's finger off.

373
00:26:48,987 --> 00:26:50,187
You heard him.

374
00:26:53,021 --> 00:26:54,921
Before you go, you better...

375
00:26:57,201 --> 00:26:58,901
You better lock me down.

376
00:26:59,592 --> 00:27:00,910
But good.

377
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:11,080
Hang in there,
we'll be back as soon as we can.

378
00:27:11,205 --> 00:27:12,214
Be careful.

379
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:14,008
And hurry.

380
00:27:39,244 --> 00:27:40,294
Hey, Marty.

381
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:43,467
Is Dr. Corman around?

382
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,860
- You haven't heard?
- Heard what?

383
00:27:55,127 --> 00:27:57,527
Guy's been dry
for the last 20 years.

384
00:27:57,868 --> 00:28:00,518
But this morning,
he left work, went home,

385
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:02,223
and drank himself to death.

386
00:28:02,727 --> 00:28:03,827
It's famine.

387
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,307
Pardon?

388
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,645
- Give us a minute, please?
- Sure.

389
00:28:14,488 --> 00:28:15,488
Crap!

390
00:28:17,582 --> 00:28:18,932
I liked this guy.

391
00:28:25,449 --> 00:28:27,449
They haven't harvested his soul yet.

392
00:28:30,111 --> 00:28:32,689
If we wanna play "follow the soul"
to get to famine,

393
00:28:33,243 --> 00:28:35,298
our best shot
starts with the doc, here.

394
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,790
Are you serious?

395
00:29:08,906 --> 00:29:10,206
These make me...

396
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,335
Very happy.

397
00:29:15,381 --> 00:29:17,681
- How many is that?
- I lost count.

398
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,831
It's in the low hundreds.

399
00:29:23,605 --> 00:29:25,405
What I don't understand is

400
00:29:26,466 --> 00:29:28,016
where is your hunger?

401
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:32,748
Slowly but surely,
everyone in this town

402
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:35,942
is falling prey to famine,
but so far, you seem unaffected.

403
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:39,779
When I wanna drink, I drink.

404
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:41,606
When I want sex, I go get it.

405
00:29:41,731 --> 00:29:44,031
Same goes for a sandwich or a fight.

406
00:29:45,202 --> 00:29:46,911
You're saying
you're just well-adjusted?

407
00:29:47,139 --> 00:29:48,989
God, no. I'm just well-fed.

408
00:29:52,128 --> 00:29:53,128
There.

409
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Guys?

410
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:23,689
What happened?

411
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:26,879
I don't think it worked.
I think I'm still...

412
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:32,138
- Still hungry.
- Look at this.

413
00:30:32,853 --> 00:30:34,853
Someone trussed you up for us.

414
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,211
Boss says we can't kill you.

415
00:30:38,716 --> 00:30:41,257
But I bet
we can break off a few pieces.

416
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:06,798
Get him off!

417
00:31:06,923 --> 00:31:08,023
Get him off!

418
00:31:20,668 --> 00:31:21,918
Wait your turn.

419
00:31:39,463 --> 00:31:40,463
Demons.

420
00:31:44,242 --> 00:31:45,966
You want to go over the plan again?

421
00:31:48,231 --> 00:31:49,281
Happy meal!

422
00:31:49,776 --> 00:31:50,776
The plan?

423
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:52,703
I take the knife,

424
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,235
I go in,
I cut off the ring hand of famine,

425
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,749
and I meet you back here.

426
00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:01,010
Well, that sounds foolproof.

427
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,000
This is taking too long.

428
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,980


429
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:19,546
The other Mr. Winchester.

430
00:33:20,247 --> 00:33:21,584
What did you do to him?

431
00:33:21,983 --> 00:33:23,711
You sicced your dog on me.

432
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:25,629
I just threw him a steak.

433
00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:28,669
So this is your big trick?

434
00:33:30,605 --> 00:33:32,470
Making people cuckoo
for cocoa puffs?

435
00:33:33,473 --> 00:33:36,180
Doesn't take much. Hardly a push.

436
00:33:36,816 --> 00:33:37,816
America...

437
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:39,941
All-you-can-eat, all the time.

438
00:33:40,066 --> 00:33:41,562
Consume, consume.

439
00:33:42,092 --> 00:33:43,492
A swarm of locusts

440
00:33:43,617 --> 00:33:44,967
in stretch pants.

441
00:33:46,311 --> 00:33:49,148
And yet, you're all still starving

442
00:33:49,273 --> 00:33:51,572
because hunger

443
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,788
doesn't just come from the body,

444
00:33:53,913 --> 00:33:56,442
it also comes from the soul.

445
00:33:57,298 --> 00:33:59,784
It's funny, it doesn't seem
to be coming from mine.

446
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:02,791
I noticed that.

447
00:34:04,077 --> 00:34:06,077
Have you wondered why that is?

448
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:08,172
How you could even

449
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,256
walk in my presence?

450
00:34:11,335 --> 00:34:14,265
I like to think it's because
of my strength of character.

451
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:17,251
I disagree.

452
00:34:28,406 --> 00:34:29,406
I see.

453
00:34:33,218 --> 00:34:35,269
That's one deep, dark...

454
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:38,493
Nothing you got there, Dean.

455
00:34:40,885 --> 00:34:42,535
Can't fill it, can you?

456
00:34:43,496 --> 00:34:44,646
Not with food

457
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:45,918
or drink,

458
00:34:46,363 --> 00:34:47,763
not even with sex.

459
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:49,338
You're so full of crap.

460
00:34:49,624 --> 00:34:51,667
You can smirk and joke

461
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:53,477
and lie to your brother,

462
00:34:53,602 --> 00:34:54,885
lie to yourself,

463
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:56,220
but not to me!

464
00:34:57,052 --> 00:34:59,603
I can see inside you, Dean.

465
00:35:01,114 --> 00:35:02,114
I can see

466
00:35:03,261 --> 00:35:05,021
how broken you are,

467
00:35:05,702 --> 00:35:07,194
how defeated.

468
00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:09,810
You can't win, and you know it.

469
00:35:10,111 --> 00:35:11,211
But you just

470
00:35:11,336 --> 00:35:12,936
keep fighting. Just...

471
00:35:14,588 --> 00:35:17,333
Keep going through the motions.

472
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:20,856
You're not hungry, Dean,
because inside,

473
00:35:21,681 --> 00:35:22,830
you're already...

474
00:35:23,737 --> 00:35:24,737
Dead.

475
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,420
Let him go.

476
00:35:38,657 --> 00:35:39,657
Stop!

477
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:41,599
No one

478
00:35:42,209 --> 00:35:43,601
lays a finger on this

479
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:45,119
sweet little boy.

480
00:35:46,729 --> 00:35:48,610
Sam, I see you got

481
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:50,316
the snack I sent you.

482
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:54,097
- You sent?
- Don't worry.

483
00:35:54,505 --> 00:35:56,505
You're not like everyone else.

484
00:35:56,766 --> 00:35:58,866
You'll never die
from drinking too much.

485
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:00,769
You're the exception

486
00:36:00,894 --> 00:36:02,444
that proves the rule.

487
00:36:02,569 --> 00:36:03,819
Just the way...

488
00:36:05,005 --> 00:36:06,832
Satan wanted you to be.

489
00:36:08,268 --> 00:36:09,268
So...

490
00:36:11,616 --> 00:36:12,838
Cut their throats.

491
00:36:14,301 --> 00:36:15,424
Have at them!

492
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:19,358
Please, be my guest.

493
00:37:05,442 --> 00:37:06,442
Well...

494
00:37:07,671 --> 00:37:08,671
Fine.

495
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:11,902
If you don't want them...

496
00:37:13,487 --> 00:37:15,815
Then I'll have them.

497
00:37:42,908 --> 00:37:44,408
I'm a horseman, Sam.

498
00:37:45,655 --> 00:37:46,916
Your power

499
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:49,018
doesn't work on me.

500
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:51,817
You're right.

501
00:37:52,183 --> 00:37:53,933
But it will work on them.

502
00:38:43,578 --> 00:38:44,578


503
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:49,838
Help... Help!

504
00:38:52,637 --> 00:38:55,087
Guys...
If you're out there, please...

505
00:38:55,502 --> 00:38:56,502
Help!

506
00:39:02,353 --> 00:39:04,053
That's not him in there.

507
00:39:05,951 --> 00:39:07,001
Not really.

508
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,390
I know.

509
00:39:14,154 --> 00:39:16,754
Sam
just has to get it out of his system.

510
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:18,917
- Then he'll be...
- Listen, I just...

511
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,910
I just need to get some air.

512
00:40:12,973 --> 00:40:13,973
Please...

513
00:40:17,116 --> 00:40:18,116
I can't...

514
00:40:26,151 --> 00:40:27,501
I need some help.

515
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:33,721
Please?
