1
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:17,155
Lilith is trying to break the 66 seals
to free Lucifer from hell.

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,225
Lucifer will bring the apocalypse.

3
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:41,832
You're possessing some poor bastard?

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,459
This is... a vessel.

5
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,929
I had to give my consent
to invite him in.

6
00:00:56,553 --> 00:00:57,874
Chuck shurley?

7
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,219
We have a life. You've been
using it to write your books.

8
00:01:00,344 --> 00:01:02,554
Dean, let him go.
This man is to be protected.

9
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,547
- Why?
- He's a prophet of the lord.

10
00:01:04,672 --> 00:01:06,848
- Who are you?
- I'm Zachariah. I'm Castiel's superior.

11
00:01:06,973 --> 00:01:08,359
And how am I gonna ice lilith?

12
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:10,519
You're not.
Lilith's going to break the final seal.

13
00:01:10,644 --> 00:01:13,989
- You don't want to stop it, do you?
- You are chosen. You will stop it.

14
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,926
Just... not lilith
or the apocalypse, that's all.

15
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,213
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:38,748
- Sammy, let's go.
- Dean...

17
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:42,810
He's coming.

18
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,273
- Come on.
- Dean!

19
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,670
What the devil is your name?

20
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,780
Sa... S... S...

21
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:29,432
Yosemite Sam!

22
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,134
Yosemite Sam?

23
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:32,811
Let's see.

24
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:36,306
Here it is.

25
00:02:39,587 --> 00:02:40,848
What the hell?

26
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:42,338
I don't know.

27
00:02:42,602 --> 00:02:45,022
Folks, quick word
from the flight deck.

28
00:02:45,423 --> 00:02:48,760
We're just passing over
Ilchester, then Ellicott city,

29
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:51,074
on our initial descent
into Baltimore...

30
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,698
Ilchester?
Weren't we just there?

31
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,682
So if you'd like to stretch your legs,
now would be a good time to...

32
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,134
Holy crap!

33
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,741
= S05E01 =

34
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:18,280
Supernatural Team

35
00:03:27,803 --> 00:03:29,729
... and governor
O'Malley urged calm,

36
00:03:29,854 --> 00:03:31,723
saying it's very unlikely
an abandoned convent

37
00:03:31,848 --> 00:03:33,548
would be a target for terrorists,

38
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:35,548
either foreign...
- Change the station.

39
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,961
Hurricane kinley, unexpectedly slamming
into the galveston area...

40
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,720
... announced a successful test
of the north korean nuclear...

41
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:43,731
- ... baffled...
- ... swine flu...

42
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,556
Don't say anything.

43
00:03:56,989 --> 00:03:58,120
It's okay.

44
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,251
We just got to keep our heads down

45
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:02,992
and hash this out, all right?

46
00:04:07,356 --> 00:04:08,669
First things first.

47
00:04:08,794 --> 00:04:11,162
How did we end up on "soul plane"?

48
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:12,878
Angels, maybe?

49
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,447
I mean beaming us out of harm's way?

50
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:18,019
Whatever.
It's the least of our worries.

51
00:04:18,294 --> 00:04:19,641
We need to find Cass.

52
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:04,593
Geez!

53
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:06,513
Sam.

54
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:07,997
Hey, Chuck.

55
00:05:08,122 --> 00:05:10,224
So... you're okay?

56
00:05:11,183 --> 00:05:12,403
My head hurts.

57
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:14,740
No, I mean my last vision.

58
00:05:14,865 --> 00:05:16,607
You went, like, full-On vader.

59
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,593
Your body temperature was 150.
Your heart rate was 200.

60
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,049
Your eyes were black.

61
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:22,573
Your eyes went black?

62
00:05:25,003 --> 00:05:26,023
I didn't know.

63
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:29,774
Where's Cass?

64
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,589
He's dead.

65
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,415
Or gone.

66
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:35,837
The archangel
smote the crap out of him.

67
00:05:36,674 --> 00:05:38,170
- I'm sorry.
- You're sure?

68
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,339
Maybe he just vanished
into the light or something.

69
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,668
He, like, exploded.

70
00:05:42,793 --> 00:05:45,194
Like a water balloon of chunky soup.

71
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:50,956
You got a...

72
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:53,463
Right here?

73
00:06:02,297 --> 00:06:03,512
Is that a molar?

74
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:06,782
Do I have a molar in my hair?

75
00:06:09,572 --> 00:06:11,275
This has been
a really stressful day.

76
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,080
Cass, you stupid bastard.

77
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,361
Stupid?
He was trying to help us.

78
00:06:15,486 --> 00:06:16,582
Yeah, exactly.

79
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,856
- So, what now?
- I don't know.

80
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:20,599
Oh, crap.

81
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,490
What?

82
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:24,920
I can feel them.

83
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:27,569
Thought we'd find you here.

84
00:06:30,816 --> 00:06:32,501
Playtime's over, Dean.

85
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:34,560
Time to come with us.

86
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:36,512
You just keep
your distance, ass-hat.

87
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,826
- You're upset.
- Yeah, a little.

88
00:06:40,951 --> 00:06:43,152
You sons of bitches
jump-started judgment day!

89
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,764
Maybe we let it happen.
We didn't start anything.

90
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:47,072
Right, Sammy?

91
00:06:48,161 --> 00:06:50,325
You had a chance to stop
your brother, and you couldn't.

92
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:52,982
So let's not quibble
over who started what.

93
00:06:53,107 --> 00:06:56,474
Let's just say it was
all our faults and move on.

94
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,417
'Cause like it or not...

95
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:02,413
... it's apocalypse now.

96
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:04,570
And we're back
on the same team again.

97
00:07:04,914 --> 00:07:05,762
Is that so?

98
00:07:05,887 --> 00:07:08,101
You want to kill the devil.
We want you to kill the devil.

99
00:07:08,226 --> 00:07:09,641
It's... synergy.

100
00:07:09,766 --> 00:07:12,290
And I'm just supposed to trust you?

101
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:14,159
Cram it with walnuts, ugly.

102
00:07:14,854 --> 00:07:16,268
This isn't a game, son.

103
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:19,831
Lucifer is powerful
in ways that defy description.

104
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:23,135
We need to strike now, hard and fast

105
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,777
before he finds his vessel.

106
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:26,595
His vessel?

107
00:07:27,742 --> 00:07:29,291
Lucifer needs a meat suit?

108
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:31,025
He is an angel.

109
00:07:31,814 --> 00:07:33,686
Them's the rules.

110
00:07:34,273 --> 00:07:35,546
And when he touches down,

111
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:38,817
we're talking four horsemen,
red oceans, fiery skies...

112
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:40,585
The greatest hits.

113
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,587
You can stop him, Dean.

114
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,762
But you need our help.

115
00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:48,801
You listen to me,
you two-faced douche.

116
00:07:49,743 --> 00:07:52,563
After what you did, I don't want
jack squat from you!

117
00:07:52,688 --> 00:07:54,348
You listen to me, boy!

118
00:07:55,361 --> 00:07:57,392
You think you can rebel against us?

119
00:07:57,593 --> 00:07:59,295
As Lucifer did?

120
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:01,980
You're bleeding.

121
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:07,402
A little insurance policy
in case you dicks showed up.

122
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,776
No!

123
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:22,851
Learned that from my friend
Cass, you son of a bitch.

124
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,222
This sucks ass.

125
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,791
Here.

126
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,665
Hex bags. No way the angels
will find us with those.

127
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,965
- Demons, either, for that matter.
- Where'd you get it?

128
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,544
- I made it.
- How?

129
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:11,247
I learned it from ruby.

130
00:09:16,137 --> 00:09:17,215
Speaking of...

131
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:19,017
How you doing?

132
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,009
Are you jonesing for another hit
of bitch blood or what?

133
00:09:22,934 --> 00:09:23,755
It's weird.

134
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,324
I tell you the truth, I'm fine.

135
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:27,728
No shakes, no fever.

136
00:09:27,853 --> 00:09:30,818
It's like whoever put me
on that plane cleaned me right up.

137
00:09:32,091 --> 00:09:33,631
Supernatural methadone.

138
00:09:34,046 --> 00:09:35,385
Yeah, I guess.

139
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,203
- Dean.
- Sam.

140
00:09:40,158 --> 00:09:42,931
It's okay. You don't
have to say anything.

141
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,618
That's good.

142
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:49,647
Because what can I even say?

143
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:52,274
"I'm sorry"?
"I screwed up"?

144
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:56,011
Doesn't really do it justice,
you know?

145
00:09:57,301 --> 00:09:59,225
Look, there's nothing
I can do or say

146
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,825
that will ever make this right.

147
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,285
So why do you keep bringing it up?

148
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:09,600
All I'm saying is,

149
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:11,610
why do we have to put this
under a microscope?

150
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:15,080
We made a mess.
We clean it up. That's it.

151
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:19,311
All right, so,
say this is just any other hunt.

152
00:10:19,782 --> 00:10:21,409
You know?
What do we do first?

153
00:10:21,742 --> 00:10:24,916
We'd, figure out where the thing is.

154
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,151
All right.

155
00:10:26,276 --> 00:10:28,386
So we just got to find...

156
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:29,795
The devil.

157
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:55,573
All right, keep it together.

158
00:11:56,544 --> 00:11:58,412
Keep it together, man.

159
00:12:16,186 --> 00:12:17,617
It's you, Nick.

160
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,634
You're special.

161
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:22,052
You're chosen.

162
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:46,973
"And then Sam touched..."

163
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,356
No.

164
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:51,186
"... caressed Dean's clavicle."

165
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,481
"This is wrong, said Dean."

166
00:12:55,429 --> 00:12:58,122
"Then I don't want to be right,"

167
00:12:58,247 --> 00:13:01,171
"replied Sam, in a husky voice."

168
00:13:13,246 --> 00:13:14,197
You.

169
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,428
- You're...
- Carver Edlund. Hi, becky.

170
00:13:16,553 --> 00:13:17,919
You got my letters.

171
00:13:18,044 --> 00:13:19,301
And my marzipan.

172
00:13:19,426 --> 00:13:21,603
Yeah, yummy.

173
00:13:21,953 --> 00:13:25,013
- But...
- I am your number-one fan.

174
00:13:25,532 --> 00:13:28,546
You know, I'm Samlicker81.

175
00:13:28,671 --> 00:13:30,058
I'm sorry. You're what?

176
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,113
Webmistress at morethanbrothers.net?

177
00:13:32,238 --> 00:13:35,049
Oh, yeah.
You're my number-one fan.

178
00:13:35,174 --> 00:13:37,619
That's why I contacted you.

179
00:13:37,744 --> 00:13:39,544
You're the only one
who will believe me.

180
00:13:40,992 --> 00:13:43,024
- Are you all right?
- No.

181
00:13:43,261 --> 00:13:44,892
I'm being watched.

182
00:13:45,017 --> 00:13:47,659
Okay, not now.
At least, I don't think so.

183
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,496
But I don't have much time.

184
00:13:50,493 --> 00:13:51,672
I need your help.

185
00:13:52,474 --> 00:13:54,297
You need my help?

186
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:55,947
That's right.

187
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:59,741
I need you to get a message
to Sam and Dean.

188
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,734
Okay?

189
00:14:04,776 --> 00:14:06,314
Look, Mr. Edlund...

190
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:09,517
Yes, I'm a fan, but I really
don't appreciate being mocked.

191
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:12,186
I know that Supernatural's
just a book, okay?

192
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,274
I know the difference
between fantasy and reality.

193
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,506
Becky, it's all real.

194
00:14:15,631 --> 00:14:17,314
I knew it!

195
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,638
But then how would
you explain an earthquake,

196
00:14:19,763 --> 00:14:21,596
a hurricane, and multiple tornadoes,

197
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:23,832
all at the same time,
all around the globe?

198
00:14:23,957 --> 00:14:25,370
Two words...
Carbon emissions.

199
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:27,323
Yeah, right, wavy gravy.

200
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:43,548
You okay, lady?

201
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,023
Sam is it really you?

202
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:50,371
And you're so firm.

203
00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:53,179
Do I know you?

204
00:14:53,304 --> 00:14:55,471
No.
But I know you.

205
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:57,499
You're Sam Winchester.

206
00:14:57,624 --> 00:14:58,990
And you're...

207
00:15:00,827 --> 00:15:02,485
... not what I pictured.

208
00:15:04,124 --> 00:15:05,028
I'm Becky.

209
00:15:05,532 --> 00:15:07,413
I read all about you guys.

210
00:15:07,538 --> 00:15:09,067
And I've even written a few...

211
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:12,437
Anyway...

212
00:15:12,562 --> 00:15:14,282
Mr. Edlund told me where you were.

213
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:15,622
Chuck?

214
00:15:17,847 --> 00:15:20,196
He's got a message,
but he's being watched.

215
00:15:20,321 --> 00:15:21,589
Angels.

216
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:23,516
Nice change-up to the mythology,
by the way.

217
00:15:23,641 --> 00:15:25,333
The demon stuff
was getting kind of old.

218
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,259
Just, what's the message?

219
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,991
He had a vision.

220
00:15:29,116 --> 00:15:32,233
"The Michael sword is on earth.
The angels lost it."

221
00:15:32,358 --> 00:15:34,307
- The Michael sword?
- Does he know where it is?

222
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,519
In a castle,
on a hill made of 42 dogs.

223
00:15:38,477 --> 00:15:39,521
42 dogs?

224
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,314
Are you sure you got that right?

225
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:45,112
It doesn't make sense,
but that's what he said.

226
00:15:45,366 --> 00:15:47,529
I memorized every word...

227
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,558
... for you.

228
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:57,641
- Can you quit touching me?
- No.

229
00:16:22,826 --> 00:16:23,961
Hey, Bobby.

230
00:16:26,008 --> 00:16:28,060
Good to see you boys
all in one piece.

231
00:16:30,398 --> 00:16:31,860
You weren't followed, were you?

232
00:16:31,985 --> 00:16:35,697
You mean by angels,
demons or Sam's new superfan?

233
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,631
- You heard.
- I heard, Romeo.

234
00:16:39,526 --> 00:16:42,184
So... sword of Michael?

235
00:16:42,505 --> 00:16:45,566
You think we're talking about the actual
sword from the actual archangel?

236
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:47,255
You better friggin' hope so.

237
00:16:49,846 --> 00:16:52,971
That's Michael toughest
sumbitch they got.

238
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,275
You kidding me? Tough?

239
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,072
That guy looks like Cate Blanchett.

240
00:16:59,197 --> 00:17:01,790
I wouldn't want to meet him
in a dark alley, believe me.

241
00:17:02,391 --> 00:17:04,025
He commands the heavenly host.

242
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:06,193
During the last
big dust-up upstairs,

243
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,672
he's the one who booted
Lucifer's ass to the basement.

244
00:17:08,797 --> 00:17:10,195
He did it with that sword.

245
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,537
So if we can find it...

246
00:17:11,662 --> 00:17:13,458
We can kick the devil's ass
all over again.

247
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,771
All right.
So, where do we start?

248
00:17:16,896 --> 00:17:18,506
Divvy up and start reading.

249
00:17:18,631 --> 00:17:21,456
Try and make sense
of Chuck's nonsense.

250
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:34,718
Kid?

251
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,276
You all right?

252
00:17:38,844 --> 00:17:40,122
No, actually.

253
00:17:42,575 --> 00:17:44,432
Bobby, this is all my fault.
I'm sorry.

254
00:17:44,557 --> 00:17:45,291
Sam...

255
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,618
Lilith did not break the final seal.

256
00:17:48,844 --> 00:17:50,456
Lilith was the final seal.

257
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:51,694
Sam, stop it.

258
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:54,781
I killed her,
and I set Lucifer free.

259
00:17:55,316 --> 00:17:56,277
You what?!

260
00:17:56,402 --> 00:17:58,947
You guys warned me about Ruby,

261
00:17:59,072 --> 00:18:01,916
the demon blood but I didn't listen.

262
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,864
I brought this on.

263
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,804
You're damn right you didn't listen.

264
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:20,568
You were reckless and selfish
and arrogant.

265
00:18:20,693 --> 00:18:21,836
I'm sorry.

266
00:18:25,197 --> 00:18:27,647
You're sorry you started armageddon?

267
00:18:28,971 --> 00:18:31,735
This kind of thing
don't get forgiven, boy.

268
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:38,450
If by some miracle,
we pull this off...

269
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,657
I want you to lose my number.

270
00:18:42,782 --> 00:18:43,997
You understand me?

271
00:18:54,226 --> 00:18:56,327
There's an old church nearby.

272
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,138
Maybe I'll go read
some of the lore books there.

273
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:03,254
You do that.

274
00:19:30,596 --> 00:19:32,921
I never would have guessed
that your daddy was right.

275
00:19:33,365 --> 00:19:34,407
About what?

276
00:19:34,532 --> 00:19:35,751
About your brother.

277
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:40,678
What John said...
You save Sam or kill him.

278
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,301
Maybe...

279
00:19:45,115 --> 00:19:45,987
Maybe what?

280
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:48,456
Maybe we shouldn't have tried
so hard to save him.

281
00:19:48,581 --> 00:19:49,373
Bobby.

282
00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:51,731
He ended the world, Dean.

283
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:54,896
And you and I weren't strong
enough to stop him proper.

284
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:56,315
That's on us.

285
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,951
I'm just saying your dad's right.

286
00:20:01,327 --> 00:20:02,378
Dad.

287
00:20:06,982 --> 00:20:09,847
- It's got to be in here somewhere.
- What the hell are you talking about?

288
00:20:10,903 --> 00:20:12,082
Here.

289
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:15,813
I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.

290
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:17,018
What the hell is it?

291
00:20:17,143 --> 00:20:19,787
It's a card for my dad's lockup
in upstate new york.

292
00:20:19,912 --> 00:20:20,867
Read it.

293
00:20:21,197 --> 00:20:23,680
"Castle storage.
42 rover hill."

294
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,266
Castle on a hill of 42 dogs.

295
00:20:28,342 --> 00:20:30,769
So you think your dad had
the Michael sword all this time?

296
00:20:30,894 --> 00:20:33,210
I don't know. I'm not sure
what else Chuck could have meant.

297
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,586
It's good enough for me.

298
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:14,118
I always knew you were a big,
dumb, slow, dim pain in the ass.

299
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:18,934
But i never dreamt
you were so v. I. p.

300
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:23,512
I mean, you're gonna ice the devil?

301
00:21:23,637 --> 00:21:24,756
You?

302
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:27,116
If i'd have known that,

303
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:30,677
i'd have ripped your pretty,
pretty face off ages ago.

304
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,459
Try again.
Go back further.

305
00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:39,365
Hi.

306
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:43,759
These are the days
of miracle and wonder.

307
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:45,672
Our father's among us.

308
00:21:45,797 --> 00:21:47,555
We're all dreaming again

309
00:21:47,797 --> 00:21:49,944
for the first time
since we were human?

310
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,141
It's heaven on earth.

311
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:53,736
Or hell.

312
00:21:55,035 --> 00:21:57,313
We really owe your brother
a fruit basket.

313
00:21:57,438 --> 00:21:59,276
My god, you like the sound
of your own voice.

314
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:03,018
But you, on the other hand,
you're the only bump in the road.

315
00:22:03,143 --> 00:22:05,838
So every demon...
every single one...

316
00:22:05,963 --> 00:22:08,121
is just dying for a piece of you.

317
00:22:08,447 --> 00:22:10,036
Get in line.

318
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:12,027
I'm in the front of the line, baby.

319
00:22:12,152 --> 00:22:13,619
Let's ride.

320
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:22,638
What is that...
peanut butter?

321
00:22:22,763 --> 00:22:25,141
Your surrogate daddy's
still awake...

322
00:22:25,266 --> 00:22:27,042
screaming in there.

323
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:30,640
And i want him to know how it
feels slicing the life out of you.

324
00:22:39,087 --> 00:22:40,107
No!

325
00:22:40,281 --> 00:22:41,581
Now!

326
00:23:02,202 --> 00:23:03,143
No!

327
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:08,674
You miss me?
'cause i sure missed you.

328
00:23:20,246 --> 00:23:23,979
It's not so easy without those
super-special demon powers,

329
00:25:35,821 --> 00:25:36,921
no!

330
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,360
No!

331
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:40,259
No!

332
00:25:42,648 --> 00:25:43,727
No!

333
00:25:44,531 --> 00:25:45,631
No!

334
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,007
Need some help here!

335
00:25:52,272 --> 00:25:53,982
What happened?
He was stabbed.

336
00:25:54,107 --> 00:25:55,741
Can we get a gurney?

337
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:02,090
Just wait here.

338
00:26:02,215 --> 00:26:03,959
No, we... we can't just leave him!

339
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:06,056
Just don't move.
I've got questions.

340
00:26:07,681 --> 00:26:09,257
- We got to go.
- No. No way.

341
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,145
The demons heard where the sword is.

342
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,200
We got to get to it before they do,
if we're not too late already.

343
00:26:14,325 --> 00:26:15,472
Come on!

344
00:27:01,341 --> 00:27:04,381
I see you told the demons
where the sword is.

345
00:27:04,945 --> 00:27:06,581
Oh, thank god.
The angels are here.

346
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,089
And to think...

347
00:27:08,214 --> 00:27:10,349
they could have grabbed it
any time they wanted.

348
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:16,091
It was right in front of them.

349
00:27:17,196 --> 00:27:18,219
What do you mean?

350
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:20,680
We may have planted that
particular piece of prophecy

351
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,741
inside chuck's skull,
but it happened to be true.

352
00:27:23,866 --> 00:27:25,541
We did lose the michael sword.

353
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:27,661
We truly couldn't find it.

354
00:27:27,786 --> 00:27:30,021
Until now. You've just
hand-delivered it to us.

355
00:27:30,303 --> 00:27:32,071
We don't have anything.

356
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:37,062
It's you, chucklehead.

357
00:27:41,147 --> 00:27:42,988
You're the michael sword.

358
00:27:51,782 --> 00:27:55,412
What? You thought you could
actually killed lucifer!

359
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,194
You simpering wad

360
00:27:57,716 --> 00:28:00,194
of insecurity and self-loathing?

361
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:01,549
No.

362
00:28:02,656 --> 00:28:04,322
You're just a human, dean.

363
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:07,168
And not much of one.

364
00:28:07,293 --> 00:28:08,937
What do you mean, i'm the sword?

365
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,438
You're michael's weapon.

366
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:13,098
Or, rather, his... receptacle.

367
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,592
- I'm a vessel?
- You're the vessel.

368
00:28:18,538 --> 00:28:20,155
Michael's vessel.

369
00:28:21,542 --> 00:28:22,661
How?
Why... why me?

370
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:24,886
Because you're chosen!

371
00:28:25,011 --> 00:28:27,288
- It's a great honor, dean.
- Oh, yeah.

372
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,751
Yeah, life as an angel condom.

373
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:31,645
That's real fun.

374
00:28:32,385 --> 00:28:34,773
I think i'll pass, thanks.

375
00:28:35,955 --> 00:28:38,099
Joking.
Always joking.

376
00:28:38,224 --> 00:28:41,209
Well...
no more jokes.

377
00:28:43,362 --> 00:28:44,606
Bang.

378
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:46,684
- God!
- You son of a bitch!

379
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:49,159
Keep mouthing off,
i'll break more than his legs.

380
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,345
I am completely and utterly through

381
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,828
screwing around.

382
00:28:56,576 --> 00:29:00,154
The war has begun.
We don't have our general. That's bad.

383
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:02,655
Now, michael is
going to take his vessel

384
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:06,778
and lead the final charge against
the adversary. You understand me?

385
00:29:06,903 --> 00:29:09,502
How many humans die
in the crossfire, huh?

386
00:29:09,856 --> 00:29:12,609
- A million? 5, 10?
- Probably more.

387
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:14,904
If lucifer goes unchecked,
you know how many die?

388
00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:17,088
All of them.
He'll roast the planet alive.

389
00:29:19,565 --> 00:29:21,955
There's a reason
you're telling me this

390
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,056
instead of just nabbing me.

391
00:29:24,771 --> 00:29:26,898
You need my consent.

392
00:29:27,023 --> 00:29:29,725
Michael needs my say-so
to ride around in my skin.

393
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:32,769
Unfortunately, yes.

394
00:29:34,071 --> 00:29:36,858
- There's got to be another way.
- There is no other way.

395
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,526
There must be a battle.

396
00:29:38,852 --> 00:29:40,495
Michael must defeat the serpent.

397
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,812
- It is written.
- Yeah, maybe.

398
00:29:43,689 --> 00:29:45,552
But, on the other hand...

399
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,253
eat me.

400
00:29:47,937 --> 00:29:49,637
The answer's no.

401
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,940
How about this?

402
00:29:52,065 --> 00:29:54,365
Your friend bobby...
we know he's gravely injured.

403
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,305
Say yes, and we'll heal him.

404
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,269
Say no, he'll never walk again.

405
00:30:02,298 --> 00:30:03,271
No.

406
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:06,154
Then how about we heal you from...

407
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:08,417
stage-4 stomach cancer?

408
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:20,468
No.

409
00:30:20,593 --> 00:30:22,103
Then let's get really creative.

410
00:30:22,228 --> 00:30:25,497
Let's see how...
sam does without his lungs.

411
00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:31,624
Are we having fun yet?

412
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,439
You're going to say yes, dean.

413
00:30:38,564 --> 00:30:39,961
Just kill us.

414
00:30:40,131 --> 00:30:41,680
Kill you?

415
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,759
Oh, no.

416
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,551
I'm just getting started.

417
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:27,659
How are you... alive?

418
00:31:28,027 --> 00:31:30,143
That's a good question.

419
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:32,907
How did these two
end up on that airplane?

420
00:31:33,032 --> 00:31:34,743
Another good question.

421
00:31:34,868 --> 00:31:36,815
'cause the angels didn't do it.

422
00:31:37,503 --> 00:31:39,395
I think we both know
the answer, don't we?

423
00:31:39,974 --> 00:31:41,074
No.

424
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:44,266
- That's not possible.
- It scares you.

425
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:46,635
Well, it should.

426
00:31:47,146 --> 00:31:50,125
Now, put these boys
back together and go.

427
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,284
I won't ask twice.

428
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,315
You two need to be more careful.

429
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,442
Yeah, i'm starting to get that.

430
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:10,843
Your frat brothers
are bigger dicks than i thought.

431
00:32:11,037 --> 00:32:12,981
I don't mean the angels.

432
00:32:13,106 --> 00:32:15,682
Lucifer is circling his vessel.

433
00:32:15,852 --> 00:32:17,085
And once he takes it,

434
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:19,692
those hex bags won't be enough
to protect you.

435
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,924
- What the hell was that?
- An enochian sigil.

436
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,566
It'll hide you from every angel
in creation, including lucifer.

437
00:32:31,691 --> 00:32:34,651
- What, you just brand us with it?
- No. I carved it into your ribs.

438
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,880
Hey, cass, were you really dead?

439
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:41,733
Yes.

440
00:32:44,703 --> 00:32:46,504
Then how are you back?

441
00:33:12,631 --> 00:33:14,599
You're dreaming, nick.

442
00:33:16,318 --> 00:33:18,420
But it doesn't mean this isn't real.

443
00:33:25,902 --> 00:33:27,920
I'm not your wife, nick.

444
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,502
I'm an angel.

445
00:33:32,352 --> 00:33:33,593
An angel?

446
00:33:34,376 --> 00:33:36,521
My name is lucifer.

447
00:33:39,258 --> 00:33:40,583
Sure.

448
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,332
Naturally.

449
00:33:45,298 --> 00:33:47,441
Could you do me
a favor there, satan,

450
00:33:47,566 --> 00:33:50,276
and remind me to quit drinking
before i go to bed?

451
00:33:50,503 --> 00:33:52,821
I'm here because
you're special, nick.

452
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:58,034
There's very, very few people
like you.

453
00:33:58,553 --> 00:33:59,820
Is that so?

454
00:33:59,945 --> 00:34:03,164
You're a vessel...
a very powerful vessel.

455
00:34:05,118 --> 00:34:07,131
Meaning what, exactly?

456
00:34:07,904 --> 00:34:11,112
I need to take control
of your mind and your body.

457
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,046
To be honest...

458
00:34:16,695 --> 00:34:18,739
it'll probably be
unpleasant for you.

459
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:20,508
But it is necessary.

460
00:34:20,633 --> 00:34:22,610
Okay, look...

461
00:34:22,735 --> 00:34:25,413
if it's just the same to you,
i think i'd like to wake up now.

462
00:34:25,538 --> 00:34:27,939
I told you...
this is real.

463
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:31,121
Don't be afraid.

464
00:34:31,744 --> 00:34:33,512
This is your choice.

465
00:34:35,318 --> 00:34:36,949
You need to invite me in.

466
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:41,912
Even if this is real, which it's not,
but assuming it was...

467
00:34:43,198 --> 00:34:45,323
why the hell would i do
something like that?

468
00:34:47,326 --> 00:34:49,117
You people misunderstand me.

469
00:34:50,229 --> 00:34:54,020
You call me "satan"
and "devil," but...

470
00:34:54,846 --> 00:34:56,450
do you know my crime?

471
00:34:57,972 --> 00:35:00,930
I loved god too much.

472
00:35:01,174 --> 00:35:03,217
And for that, he betrayed me...

473
00:35:03,394 --> 00:35:04,796
punished me.

474
00:35:06,512 --> 00:35:08,350
Just as he's punished you.

475
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:13,361
After all, how could god
stand idly by

476
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:15,528
while that man broke into your home

477
00:35:15,788 --> 00:35:18,198
and butchered your family
in their beds?

478
00:35:19,403 --> 00:35:21,794
There are only
two rational answers, nick...

479
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,495
either he's sadistic...

480
00:35:25,364 --> 00:35:27,426
or he simply doesn't care.

481
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:31,608
You're angry.

482
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:35,386
You have every right to be angry.

483
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:37,413
I am angry, too.

484
00:35:37,538 --> 00:35:39,820
That's why i want to find him...

485
00:35:39,945 --> 00:35:43,657
hold him accountable for his actions.
Just because he created us

486
00:35:43,782 --> 00:35:46,827
doesn't mean he can toy with us,
like playthings.

487
00:35:46,952 --> 00:35:48,291
If i help you...

488
00:35:50,556 --> 00:35:53,163
can you bring back my family?

489
00:35:53,653 --> 00:35:55,045
I'm sorry.

490
00:35:56,061 --> 00:35:57,662
I can't.

491
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,635
But i can give you
the next best thing.

492
00:36:07,406 --> 00:36:09,741
God did this to you, nick.

493
00:36:11,577 --> 00:36:14,016
And i can give you justice.

494
00:36:14,947 --> 00:36:16,281
Peace.

495
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:20,395
How do i know
you're telling the truth?

496
00:36:20,968 --> 00:36:23,137
Because, contrary to popular belief,

497
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:25,823
i don't lie.

498
00:36:27,163 --> 00:36:29,194
I don't need to.

499
00:36:31,364 --> 00:36:32,899
What i need...

500
00:36:34,033 --> 00:36:35,359
is you.

501
00:36:39,508 --> 00:36:42,163
Nick, i need you to say yes.

502
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,954
Then yes.

503
00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:16,589
"Unlikely to walk again"?!

504
00:37:16,714 --> 00:37:19,058
Why, you snot-nosed son of a bitch!

505
00:37:19,183 --> 00:37:21,385
Wait till i get out of this bed!

506
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:24,905
I'll use my game leg
and kick your friggin' ass!

507
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:27,131
Yeah, you better run!

508
00:37:27,891 --> 00:37:30,980
- You believe that yahoo?
- Screw him. You'll be fine.

509
00:37:33,186 --> 00:37:35,467
So, let me ask
the million-dollar question.

510
00:37:36,668 --> 00:37:38,299
What do we do now?

511
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,674
Well...

512
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:44,274
we save as many as we can
for as long as we can, i guess.

513
00:37:44,815 --> 00:37:46,419
It's bad.

514
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,775
Whoever wins, heaven or hell,
we're boned.

515
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,591
What if we win? I'm serious.

516
00:37:52,167 --> 00:37:55,595
Screw the angels and the demons
and their crap apocalypse.

517
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,994
They want to fight a war,
they can find their own planet.

518
00:37:59,324 --> 00:38:02,214
This one's ours, and i say
they get the hell off it.

519
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:04,237
We take 'em all on.
We kill the devil.

520
00:38:04,362 --> 00:38:06,117
Hell, we even kill michael
if we have to.

521
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,274
But we do it our own damn selves.

522
00:38:08,576 --> 00:38:11,330
And how are we supposed to
do all this, genius?

523
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:13,081
I got no idea.

524
00:38:13,765 --> 00:38:16,516
But what i do have is a g. E. d.

525
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:19,121
And a "give 'em hell" attitude,
and i'll figure it out.

526
00:38:22,379 --> 00:38:24,551
You are nine kinds of crazy, boy.

527
00:38:26,183 --> 00:38:27,450
It's been said.

528
00:38:28,453 --> 00:38:30,698
Listen, you stay on the mend.

529
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:32,453
We'll see you in a bit.

530
00:38:38,563 --> 00:38:40,093
I was awake.

531
00:38:42,282 --> 00:38:44,300
I know what i said back there.

532
00:38:46,136 --> 00:38:48,073
I just want you to know that...

533
00:38:48,684 --> 00:38:50,869
that was the demon talking.

534
00:38:54,903 --> 00:38:57,080
I ain't cutting you out, boy.

535
00:38:57,391 --> 00:38:58,334
Not ever.

536
00:39:04,288 --> 00:39:05,555
Thanks, bobby.

537
00:39:06,057 --> 00:39:07,791
You're welcome.

538
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:11,019
I deserve a damn medal
for this, but...

539
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,974
you're welcome.

540
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,684
You know, i was thinking, dean...

541
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:26,352
maybe we could go after the colt.

542
00:39:26,477 --> 00:39:28,115
Why? What difference
would that make?

543
00:39:28,284 --> 00:39:30,836
We could use it
on lucifer. You just said back there...

544
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:33,016
i just said a bunch of crap
for bobby's benefit.

545
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:37,530
I mean...
i'll fight.

546
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:40,627
I'll fight till the last man,
but let's at least be honest.

547
00:39:40,752 --> 00:39:43,558
We don't stand
a snowball's chance, and you know that.

548
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:47,030
I mean, hell,
you of all people know that.

549
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,392
Is there something
you want to say to me?

550
00:40:02,346 --> 00:40:04,312
I tried, sammy.

551
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:07,904
I mean, i really tried.

552
00:40:09,053 --> 00:40:12,088
But i just can't keep pretending
that everything's all right.

553
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:15,382
Because it's not.

554
00:40:16,115 --> 00:40:17,937
And it's never going to be.

555
00:40:18,062 --> 00:40:21,106
You chose a demon
over your own brother,

556
00:40:21,231 --> 00:40:24,018
- and look what happened.
- I would give anything...

557
00:40:24,322 --> 00:40:25,611
anything...

558
00:40:25,736 --> 00:40:28,105
- to take it all back.
- I know you would.

559
00:40:30,274 --> 00:40:33,018
And i know how sorry you are. I do.

560
00:40:33,143 --> 00:40:34,544
But, man...

561
00:40:36,948 --> 00:40:39,248
you were the one
that i depended on the most.

562
00:40:40,885 --> 00:40:43,604
And you let me down
in ways that i can't even...

563
00:40:48,192 --> 00:40:51,089
i'm just... i'm having a hard time

564
00:40:51,214 --> 00:40:53,622
forgiving and forgetting here.
You know?

565
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:58,234
What can i do?

566
00:41:00,972 --> 00:41:02,371
Honestly?

567
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:04,961
Nothing.

568
00:41:07,449 --> 00:41:08,956
I just don't...

569
00:41:10,715 --> 00:41:13,396
i don't think that we can
ever be what we were.

570
00:41:13,684 --> 00:41:14,885
You know?

571
00:41:17,685 --> 00:41:20,060
I just don't think i can trust you.
