1
00:00:25,729 --> 00:00:29,558
And the second you find out this ruby chick
is a demon, you go for the holy water.

2
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:31,671
- You don't chat.
- No one was chatting, dean.

3
00:00:31,672 --> 00:00:34,922
- Then why didn't you send her ass back to hell?
- She told me she could help you, okay?

4
00:00:34,923 --> 00:00:36,661
She knows what your weakness is.It's me.

5
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:40,330
- Think something's wrong with my brother?
- No. Demons lie.

6
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,662
Last i checked, dean's
still going to hell.

7
00:00:42,663 --> 00:00:44,560
Everything in its own time, sam.

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,279
You're gonna have to do things that
go against that gentle nature of yours.

9
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:51,080
- On the bright side,
- i'll be there with you...

10
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:55,503
That little fallen
angel on your shoulder.

11
00:01:12,142 --> 00:01:18,433
That was just a terrible, terrible party.

12
00:01:19,492 --> 00:01:22,299
But there was this one
really beautiful woman there.

13
00:01:23,936 --> 00:01:26,793
- You should have gone home with her.
- I did.

14
00:01:33,252 --> 00:01:35,562
- I need a few minutes.
- All right.

15
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,398
There's a bottle of '89 in the fridge.

16
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,173
Oh, god.

17
00:02:36,342 --> 00:02:37,760
What the...

18
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,788
Paul!

19
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:47,040
- What is it?
- It's my teeth.

20
00:02:49,414 --> 00:02:51,840
- Janet?!
- Help me!

21
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,200
Supernatural season 3 episode 9

22
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:27,200
Transcript : www.Yyets.net
Synchro : Flolo

23
00:03:34,191 --> 00:03:36,623
I couldn't help. I couldn't
do anything to stop it.

24
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:41,920
I've talked to the police and i've
talked to the medical examiner

25
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,668
And no one can explain it.

26
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:46,060
That's why they put the
call into us, mr. Dutton.

27
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:48,705
But the cdc... That's
disease control, right?

28
00:03:48,706 --> 00:03:50,732
What do you think
it's some kind of virus?

29
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:52,830
We're not ruling out anything yet.

30
00:03:53,255 --> 00:03:55,960
- Mr. Dutton, did janet have any enemies?
- I'm sorry?

31
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:58,386
Anyone that had a reason to hurt her?

32
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,827
What are you saying that
somebody poisoned her?

33
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:04,673
I'm just saying we have to cover
every base here.

34
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:08,229
I mean, what kind of poison? You think
a person could have done this?

35
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,429
- Would anyone want to?
- What? No.

36
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,400
No, there's no one that could have...

37
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,113
Mr. Dutton?

38
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:22,043
Uh, everyone loved janet.

39
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,577
Okay.Thank you very much.
I think we got everything we need.

40
00:04:30,578 --> 00:04:32,067
We'll be out of your way now.

41
00:04:37,282 --> 00:04:39,930
- That dude seem a little evasive to you?
- I don't know.

42
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:42,776
I was under a sink...pulling this out.

43
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:44,460
Hex bag.

44
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,753
- Ohh, gross.
- Yeah.

45
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,838
Bird bones, rabbit's teeth.
This cloth was probably cut

46
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,230
from something janet dutton owned.

47
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,089
- So we're thinking witch?
- Uh, yeah.

48
00:04:55,136 --> 00:04:57,949
And not some new-Age wiccan
water douser, either.

49
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,130
This is old-World black magic, dean,

50
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,162
I mean, warts and all.

51
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,539
I hate witches.

52
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,742
They're always spewing
their bodily fluids everywhere.

53
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,263
- Pretty much.
- It's creepy. It's downright unsanitary.

54
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:18,422
Yeah, well, someone definitely
had it out for janet dutton.

55
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:20,730
Yeah, someone who snuck into
that house and planted the bag.

56
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:24,275
So, what are we thinking? Looking for
some craggy old blair bitch in the woods?

57
00:05:24,276 --> 00:05:27,837
No, it could be anyone...
A neighbor, coworker, man, woman.

58
00:05:27,838 --> 00:05:29,492
They're human. They're like everyone else.

59
00:05:29,493 --> 00:05:31,930
- How are we gonna find them?
- This wasn't random.

60
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,730
Someone in janet dutton's life
had an ugly ax to grind.

61
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,265
- We find the motive...
- We find the murderer.

62
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:38,384
Yeah.

63
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:57,881
Amanda?

64
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,869
- Hey, amanda!
- Oh, elizabeth, hi.

65
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,400
Sorry, i've got, like,
a thousand things on my mind.

66
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,187
Are you okay, sweetie?

67
00:06:08,273 --> 00:06:10,140
You didn't come to book club last night.

68
00:06:10,141 --> 00:06:13,443
Yeah, sorry.I was gonna call.
I just... I got busy, you know?

69
00:06:14,726 --> 00:06:18,228
But i'm fine, really. I am. Thanks.

70
00:07:41,404 --> 00:07:44,653
This dinner was cooked for you,
paul arthur dutton.

71
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:49,204
Now you're going to eat it.

72
00:08:45,187 --> 00:08:46,567
Got it!

73
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,000
You okay?

74
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,834
What the hell is happening to me?

75
00:09:07,852 --> 00:09:09,760
Someone murdered your wife.
Now they're trying to kill you.

76
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,759
That's impossible. There's no way...

77
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,130
If we hadn't been following you,
you'd be a doornail.

78
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,595
Now, who wants you dead?

79
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:19,129
- Come on, think.
- There's a woman.

80
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,127
- Okay, a woman.
- An affair, a-A mistake.

81
00:09:22,301 --> 00:09:26,043
She was unbalanced. She was blackmailing me.
I put an end to it a week ago.

82
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:27,660
- What's her name?
- Wha...

83
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,929
- What could she have to do with what...
- Paul, what is her name?

84
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:37,154
- That's a curveball.
- Yeah.

85
00:10:53,145 --> 00:10:55,633
Three per wrist vertical.

86
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:57,586
She wasn't fooling around.

87
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,844
Yeah, looks like she was working
some heavy weight evil here.

88
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:11,768
Yep.

89
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,641
Freaking witches! Seriously, man! Come on!

90
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,915
Guess we know where she got
the rabbit's teeth from.

91
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:27,383
Paul knows how to pick 'em.
It's like "fatal attraction" all over again.

92
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,560
Why's the rabbit always
get screwed in the deal?

93
00:11:31,436 --> 00:11:33,135
Poor little guy.

94
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:37,894
You know what i don't get, dean? If
she was so bent on revenge, why do this?

95
00:11:38,005 --> 00:11:41,260
Well, she got janet dutton,

96
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,160
Thought she finished off paul,

97
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,078
decided to cap herself and make it
a spurned lover's hat trick.

98
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,646
Maybe.

99
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:52,479
This doesn't exactly look like a tv room
of a bright and stable person, you know?

100
00:11:52,498 --> 00:11:53,925
No.

101
00:11:54,132 --> 00:11:55,830
But then...

102
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:02,200
... there's this.

103
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,775
Another hex bag? Come on.

104
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,397
Looks like we got a hit, huh?
A little witch-On-Witch violence.

105
00:12:15,398 --> 00:12:16,937
I guess.

106
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,109
I'd like to report a dead body
at 309 mayfair circle.

107
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:23,898
My name? Yeah, sure, my name is...

108
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,724
Why are witches ganking each other?

109
00:12:29,056 --> 00:12:33,197
I don't know, but i think maybe
we got a coven on our hands.

110
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,406
All right, all right. I'm going.

111
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:48,683
I'm not fooled by your
little book club, by the way.

112
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,908
I know what you ladies get up
to when i'm gone.

113
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:53,130
It's all dish and gossip.

114
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,129
Hi, ron.

115
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,166
Oh, hello, elizabeth.

116
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,300
I mean, when's the last time
anyone actually brought a book?

117
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,200
- Good night, ron.
- Good night, ron.

118
00:13:03,672 --> 00:13:04,987
All right.

119
00:13:08,845 --> 00:13:12,375
He doesn't know?
You didn't tell him?

120
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:13,962
About amanda?

121
00:13:14,406 --> 00:13:17,467
I think that's book
club business, don't you?

122
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,843
Thank you, tammi.

123
00:13:19,844 --> 00:13:23,528
The police just took away her body, and
we're just gonna pretend it didn't happen?

124
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,359
He loved amanda.

125
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,793
It's true.

126
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:31,017
We know that she was a little... unstable.

127
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,979
- Also true.
- And we have to face it...

128
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,674
She probably killed janet dutton.

129
00:13:36,675 --> 00:13:39,660
People just don't spit out
their teeth all of a sudden.

130
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:41,832
We have to stop.

131
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:46,020
We have to stop book club.
This has all gone too far.

132
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:49,034
Elizabeth, just take a deep breath.

133
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:50,920
Calm down.

134
00:13:50,921 --> 00:13:52,770
We can't stop.

135
00:13:52,771 --> 00:13:54,836
But people are dying.

136
00:13:55,164 --> 00:13:59,978
Amanda killed herself, yes.
And, yes, she killed janet.

137
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,485
Awful, awful business, of course,

138
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:06,142
But that's all over now.

139
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:10,907
And think about what
book club has gotten us, hmm?

140
00:14:11,136 --> 00:14:13,211
Your husband's promotion,

141
00:14:13,492 --> 00:14:16,469
That little trip to hawaii that you won.

142
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:19,012
And what about me?

143
00:14:19,013 --> 00:14:22,120
My home pottery business
is finally taking off,

144
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:24,522
and you want to just stop?

145
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:28,000
Do you want to stop?

146
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:32,922
Okay. Now, come on.
We don't have much time.

147
00:14:32,923 --> 00:14:36,115
Ron gets back from his
fantasy football in an hour.

148
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:48,054
Book of shadows, we kneel before you.

149
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:51,293
Let us serve your master as you serve us.

150
00:14:51,486 --> 00:14:54,735
Book of shadows, we kneel before you.

151
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,200
Let us serve your master...

152
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,845
You must have a green thumb.

153
00:15:05,846 --> 00:15:07,141
Excuse me?

154
00:15:07,142 --> 00:15:09,629
Getting these herbs to grow out
of season like this.

155
00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:12,175
Quite impressive.

156
00:15:12,255 --> 00:15:14,847
I'm sorry. I should have
introduced myself first.

157
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:18,300
I'm, uh, detective bachman,
and this is detective turner.

158
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,600
Hiya.

159
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,612
We're following up
on amanda burns' death.

160
00:15:21,613 --> 00:15:24,344
Going around the neighborhood,
talking to her neighbors.

161
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:27,276
But didn't she... I mean,
she killed herself, right?

162
00:15:27,277 --> 00:15:30,630
- Maybe, maybe.
- We heard you were friends with the deceased, right?

163
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,330
Yeah, i guess so.

164
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,200
Do you have any idea about her practices?

165
00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:37,830
I'm sorry? What... What kind of practices?

166
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,500
Well, her house was littered
with satanic paraphernalia.

167
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:45,090
- It was a regular black sabbath.
- No, th... But she was an episcopalian.

168
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,640
Well, then we're pretty sure
she was using the wrong bible.

169
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:52,900
Elizabeth.

170
00:15:54,236 --> 00:15:55,767
Are you all right?

171
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:58,530
I'm fine.Uh, renee, these are detectives.

172
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,659
- They say amanda was... She was practicing...
- Sorry, detectives.

173
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,307
You can tell that elizabeth is a little upset.

174
00:16:06,747 --> 00:16:08,456
Of course, miss...

175
00:16:08,465 --> 00:16:13,039
Mrs.Renee van allen.

176
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:16,232
Would you like me to spell it for you?

177
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:18,185
I'll get by, thanks.

178
00:16:18,496 --> 00:16:21,764
This amanda business has been hard for liz,

179
00:16:21,985 --> 00:16:23,478
For all of us.

180
00:16:23,544 --> 00:16:26,760
Yeah, i mean, you think you know a person.

181
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,660
Well, i guess we all have secrets, don't we?

182
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,516
Well, thanks. Um, we'll be in touch.

183
00:16:37,628 --> 00:16:39,365
Have a nice day.

184
00:16:39,469 --> 00:16:40,731
Bye.

185
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,768
Well, i'm already sold on
that elizabeth chick.

186
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,013
Did you see that victory garden of hers?

187
00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:03,737
Belladonna, wolfsbane, mandrake.

188
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:06,887
Not to mention that little flinch she threw
when we mentioned the occult.

189
00:17:06,888 --> 00:17:09,260
Well, she's definitely had
a good run lately.

190
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:14,030
Gone up a few tax brackets,
won almost too many raffles...

191
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,518
The kind of thing a little black
magic always helps with.

192
00:17:16,546 --> 00:17:17,767
Yeah.

193
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:22,975
I don't think she's alone, either.
It looks like mrs.Renee van allen

194
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:26,446
has won almost every craft contest
she's entered in the past three months.

195
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:29,811
A regular martha stewart, huh?
Except for the devil worship.

196
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:33,205
I'm thinking that was the coven
we met back there, minus one member.

197
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,713
Amanda was clearly going off
the reservation.

198
00:17:35,714 --> 00:17:38,130
You think they killed her
to keep up appearances?

199
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,100
Seems like an appearance kind
of crowd, don't you think?

200
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:40,936
Yeah.

201
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:44,400
If they killed a nut job,
should we thank them or what?

202
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,274
They work in black magic, too, dean.
They need to be stopped.

203
00:17:48,612 --> 00:17:50,530
Stopped, like stopped?

204
00:17:51,894 --> 00:17:54,489
- They're human, sam.
- They're murderers.

205
00:17:58,431 --> 00:18:00,230
Burn, witch, burn.

206
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,526
Ruby.

207
00:18:17,527 --> 00:18:19,281
Sam, listen to me. There's no time.

208
00:18:19,282 --> 00:18:22,160
- What are you talking about?
- You have to get out of town.

209
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,973
So, this is ruby, huh?

210
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:27,249
- Never had the pleasure.
- Dean. I was hoping you'd show up again.

211
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:29,430
Point that thing somewhere else.

212
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,811
Right.

213
00:18:30,812 --> 00:18:32,652
Sam, please. Go.

214
00:18:32,755 --> 00:18:35,330
Get in the car and don't look back.

215
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,223
- Why? I don't understand.
- Hey, hot stuff, we can take care of

216
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,422
- a few kitchen witches, thanks.
- I'm not talking about witches, you jackass.

217
00:18:41,423 --> 00:18:43,309
Witches are whores.

218
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:46,070
I'm talking about who they serve.

219
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:50,330
Demons.

220
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:54,400
- They get their power from demons.
- Yeah.

221
00:18:55,121 --> 00:18:58,806
- And there's one here now.
- Oh, what, you mean besides you?

222
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:01,126
Sam, it knows you're in town,
and it's gonna come after you,

223
00:19:01,127 --> 00:19:04,958
- and it's way more than you can handle.
- Oh, come on. What is this, huh?

224
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:06,885
Please tell me you're not
listening to this crap.

225
00:19:06,886 --> 00:19:09,308
Put a leash on your brother, sam,
if you want to keep him.

226
00:19:09,326 --> 00:19:11,407
- Dean, just chill out.
- No! No!

227
00:19:11,408 --> 00:19:14,547
She's messing with your head!
God knows why. That's who they are!

228
00:19:14,548 --> 00:19:17,063
- I'm telling you the truth.
- I'm telling you to shut up, bitch!

229
00:19:17,064 --> 00:19:19,589
I'm sorry. Why are you even
a part of this conversation?

230
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,465
Maybe because he's my brother,
you black-Eyed skank!

231
00:19:22,466 --> 00:19:24,963
<i>Oh, right, right. And you care
about your brother so much.</i>

232
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:27,394
That's why you're checking out,
leaving him all alone.

233
00:19:27,395 --> 00:19:29,179
- Shut up.
- Let me try and save him

234
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,766
since you won't be here
to do it anymore.

235
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:33,000
- I said shut up!
- Dean, no!

236
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,876
What the hell were you thinking?

237
00:19:51,877 --> 00:19:54,026
What? What the hell was i thinking?

238
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:57,895
She's a demon, sam, period. All right?
They want us dead. We want them dead.

239
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,369
Oh, that's funny. I remember
that demon chick in ohio...

240
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,610
- Casey... You didn't want her dead.
- Well, she wasn't stringing

241
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,636
me along like a fish on a hook.

242
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:07,010
No one's stringing me along!

243
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:12,210
Look, i know it's dangerous
that she is dangerous

244
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:16,692
- but like it or not, she's useful.
- No! We kill her before she kills us.

245
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:20,329
Kill her with what?
The gun she fixed for us?

246
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,673
- Whatever works.
- Dean, if she wants us dead,

247
00:20:22,674 --> 00:20:25,180
all she has to do is
stop saving our lives.

248
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,433
Look, we have to start looking
at the big picture, dean.

249
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,832
start thinking in strategies
and and moves ahead.

250
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:34,317
It's not so simple. We're not
just hunting anymore.

251
00:20:34,336 --> 00:20:36,242
We're at war.

252
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,052
Are you feeling okay?

253
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:43,483
Why are you always asking me that?

254
00:20:43,484 --> 00:20:46,418
Because you're taking advice
from a demon, for starters.

255
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:49,265
And, by the way, you seem less
and less worried about offing people.

256
00:20:49,266 --> 00:20:52,317
- It used to eat you up inside.
- And what has that gotten me?

257
00:20:52,412 --> 00:20:54,966
Nothing, but it's just want
you're supposed to do, okay?

258
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:58,226
We're supposed to drive in the freaking
car and freaking argue about this stuff!

259
00:20:58,227 --> 00:21:00,911
You go on about the sanctity
of life and all that crap.

260
00:21:00,942 --> 00:21:04,680
Wait, so you're mad because i'm
starting to agree with you?

261
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,015
No, i'm not mad! I'm... I'm...

262
00:21:08,797 --> 00:21:10,234
I'm worried.

263
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,850
Sam, i'm worried because you're
not acting like yourself.

264
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,556
Yeah, you're right.I'm not.

265
00:21:14,557 --> 00:21:16,285
I don't have a choice.

266
00:21:16,286 --> 00:21:17,910
What is that supposed to mean?

267
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,280
Look, dean, you're leaving, right?

268
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:25,178
And i got to stay here in
this crap hole of a world...

269
00:21:25,413 --> 00:21:26,747
Alone.

270
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,062
So, the way i see it,
if i'm gonna make it,

271
00:21:30,063 --> 00:21:33,575
if i'm gonna fight this war after you're
gone, then i got to change.

272
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,380
Change into what?

273
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:37,380
Into you.

274
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,598
I got to be more like you.

275
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,236
What's going on with you?

276
00:21:49,237 --> 00:21:50,588
I don't know.

277
00:21:53,241 --> 00:21:54,903
Sam, something's wrong.

278
00:21:54,904 --> 00:21:56,794
A bunch of knives inside of me.

279
00:21:56,795 --> 00:21:58,587
- Dean?
- Son of a bitch.

280
00:21:58,588 --> 00:21:59,686
Dean.

281
00:22:01,505 --> 00:22:04,191
The coven, man. It's got to be the coven.

282
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,410
Dean, i can't find it!

283
00:22:33,706 --> 00:22:34,636
No.

284
00:22:40,891 --> 00:22:42,810
Sam, what are you doing?

285
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,050
Oh, my god!

286
00:23:08,807 --> 00:23:11,680
- Let him go.
- Let who go? What are you doing?

287
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,116
You're insane. Get out!

288
00:23:13,117 --> 00:23:15,567
Look, if you know about me,
then you know about this gun.

289
00:23:15,568 --> 00:23:17,971
You're killing my brother.
Now let him go.

290
00:23:17,972 --> 00:23:19,727
- Get away from the altar.
- What?

291
00:23:19,728 --> 00:23:21,007
Now!

292
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:33,478
You want to kill me? Get in line, bitch.

293
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,306
Stop... calling me bitch.

294
00:23:51,307 --> 00:23:52,311
Go.

295
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,510
What? We weren't hurting anyone.

296
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,010
Please, we don't even know your brother.

297
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,380
Stop the spell or die.

298
00:24:04,249 --> 00:24:06,410
- Five seconds.
- What?!

299
00:24:07,867 --> 00:24:09,867
No, please. Please don't kill us.

300
00:24:09,868 --> 00:24:12,552
We were just getting renee
a lower mortgage rate.

301
00:24:15,449 --> 00:24:19,643
Next time you point that gun at me, I'm not
gonna just disappear, understand?

302
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:25,437
- You...saved my life.
- Don't mention it.

303
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:27,617
What was that stuff?

304
00:24:28,661 --> 00:24:30,398
God, it was ass.

305
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,389
It tasted like ass.

306
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,925
It's called witchcraft, short bus.

307
00:24:39,153 --> 00:24:40,909
You're the short bus.

308
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,340
"Short bus."

309
00:24:42,868 --> 00:24:45,939
Okay, maybe it's not you...

310
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,431
... or you.

311
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,750
Maybe it's you.

312
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,738
I don't even know what he's talking about.
What are you even talking about?

313
00:24:59,739 --> 00:25:01,888
I mean, all of you everyone
in your little coven.

314
00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:03,708
You've all had runs of good fortune...

315
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:05,475
Newsworthy good fortune.

316
00:25:05,476 --> 00:25:07,110
Except for you, tammi.

317
00:25:08,313 --> 00:25:11,412
Now, tell me, why is that?
You didn't want anything for yourself,

318
00:25:11,413 --> 00:25:13,938
or is it because you're already
getting what you wanted,

319
00:25:13,939 --> 00:25:15,954
like these women's souls?

320
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,610
I can't... I'm not... I don't...

321
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,650
Nice dick work, magnum.

322
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:35,974
Let... my brother... go.

323
00:25:36,022 --> 00:25:39,150
What's wrong? Couldn't find my hex bag?

324
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,572
Sorry, sweetheart, but your brother's
lungs should be on the floor by now.

325
00:25:54,129 --> 00:25:56,448
You're in a lot of trouble, sam.

326
00:26:07,325 --> 00:26:09,814
Tammi, what's wrong with your eyes?

327
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,626
Tammi, what are you doing?

328
00:26:12,627 --> 00:26:14,889
Renee, shut your painted hole.

329
00:26:15,351 --> 00:26:16,515
What?

330
00:26:16,977 --> 00:26:19,869
I-I will... You can't...

331
00:26:19,889 --> 00:26:22,255
Not in my house, tammi benton.

332
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,632
Look! You got me!

333
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:31,527
- Let the girl go.
- Wait your turn, young man.

334
00:26:33,122 --> 00:26:34,943
Ohh, god!

335
00:26:36,364 --> 00:26:39,049
Lizzy, it's okay.

336
00:26:40,047 --> 00:26:41,868
You're not tammi?

337
00:26:41,926 --> 00:26:44,790
No. But i'm wearing her meat.

338
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,934
I had to break the ice with you girls somehow.

339
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:50,154
You killed renee.

340
00:26:50,321 --> 00:26:53,006
Renee, amanda.

341
00:26:53,535 --> 00:26:57,253
That's what happens to witches
who get voted off the island.

342
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:59,149
Who are you?

343
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:01,939
Funny story, actually.

344
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:08,267
You remember all those dark, demonic forces
you prayed to when you swore your servitude?

345
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:11,053
Just who did you think you were praying to?

346
00:27:11,054 --> 00:27:14,245
This... This isn't... It can't be.

347
00:27:14,246 --> 00:27:16,016
What did you think it was?

348
00:27:16,017 --> 00:27:19,167
Make-Believe, positive thinking,

349
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,712
The secret?

350
00:27:20,713 --> 00:27:23,163
No. It was me.

351
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:25,904
You sold yourself to me, you pig.

352
00:27:28,016 --> 00:27:31,021
All i had to do was bring
one good book to book club,

353
00:27:31,022 --> 00:27:33,631
and you ladies lined up to kiss my ass.

354
00:27:33,632 --> 00:27:36,645
No. No. We didn't know...

355
00:27:36,646 --> 00:27:41,407
Oh, yes, you did. You knew
every step of the way,

356
00:27:41,408 --> 00:27:44,450
and now your ever-Living souls are mine.

357
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:48,056
Comments, questions?

358
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,102
Sammy winchester, wow.

359
00:27:54,234 --> 00:27:56,496
Right here in our little town.

360
00:27:56,933 --> 00:28:01,262
You know, my friends and
i we've been looking for you.

361
00:28:01,653 --> 00:28:02,977
Why?

362
00:28:02,978 --> 00:28:05,948
Oh, right, because i'm supposed
to lead some piss-Poor demon army.

363
00:28:05,966 --> 00:28:09,783
No, not at all. You're not our messiah.

364
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,055
We don't believe in you.

365
00:28:12,252 --> 00:28:15,989
But there's a new leader rising in the west.

366
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,448
A real leader.

367
00:28:18,449 --> 00:28:20,409
That's the horse to bet on, sam,

368
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,715
the one who's gonna tear this world apart.

369
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:29,398
Thing is, this demon
it doesn't like you very much.

370
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:31,658
It doesn't want the competition.

371
00:28:39,339 --> 00:28:42,503
Nothing personal. It's a p. R. Thing.

372
00:28:43,442 --> 00:28:45,799
So, bye-Bye.

373
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:08,084
Two for one. Lovely.

374
00:29:09,671 --> 00:29:11,014
Wait.

375
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:17,329
Please.

376
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:21,152
I just... came to talk.

377
00:29:21,498 --> 00:29:23,639
You made it out of the gate.

378
00:29:23,991 --> 00:29:25,502
Impressive.

379
00:29:25,701 --> 00:29:27,560
It was a bitch of a fight, wasn't it?

380
00:29:27,561 --> 00:29:29,871
Doors out of hell only open for so long.

381
00:29:29,872 --> 00:29:31,850
What do you want, ruby?

382
00:29:32,384 --> 00:29:34,384
I've been lost without you.

383
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,033
Take me back.

384
00:29:38,012 --> 00:29:40,378
That's why i led the winchesters here.

385
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,878
They're for you... as a gift.

386
00:29:48,504 --> 00:29:50,129
Really?

387
00:29:50,896 --> 00:29:52,921
Let me serve you again.

388
00:29:53,818 --> 00:29:55,808
I've wanted it.

389
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:59,467
I've wanted you for so long.

390
00:30:01,646 --> 00:30:04,125
You were one of my best.

391
00:30:11,663 --> 00:30:14,827
But then again, you always
were a lying whore.

392
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:59,849
You're really telling me you threw in
your chips with abbott and costello here?

393
00:31:09,437 --> 00:31:12,075
Come on. Get up.

394
00:31:14,321 --> 00:31:16,424
I said get up!

395
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,475
We've been here before, haven't we?

396
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:33,597
She didn't tell you?

397
00:31:34,366 --> 00:31:36,253
Pretty mortifying, i guess.

398
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,975
She was one of mine.

399
00:31:38,976 --> 00:31:42,561
I turned her out a long, long time ago.

400
00:31:43,017 --> 00:31:45,768
Ruby here was a witch.

401
00:31:45,777 --> 00:31:47,937
Of course, that was when you were human.

402
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,447
Didn't want your friends to know

403
00:31:56,457 --> 00:32:00,072
that all those centuries back,
you sold yourself to me?

404
00:32:00,283 --> 00:32:02,734
Embarrassing, i guess.

405
00:32:03,357 --> 00:32:04,896
But don't worry, love.

406
00:32:04,897 --> 00:32:07,450
No secrets where you're heading, remember?

407
00:33:42,924 --> 00:33:44,136
Go.

408
00:33:46,956 --> 00:33:48,956
I'll clean up this mess.

409
00:33:52,469 --> 00:33:53,812
Come on.

410
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:00,292
Go.

411
00:35:01,598 --> 00:35:05,364
So, the devil may care after all.
Is that what i'm supposed to believe?

412
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:09,580
I don't believe in the devil.

413
00:35:09,853 --> 00:35:11,694
Wacky night.

414
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,723
So, let me get this straight.

415
00:35:16,029 --> 00:35:19,879
You were human once. You died,
you went to hell, and you became a...

416
00:35:20,215 --> 00:35:21,295
Yeah.

417
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,415
How long ago?

418
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,718
Back when the plague was big.

419
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:33,274
So, all of them every damn demon

420
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,550
they were all human once?

421
00:35:39,927 --> 00:35:41,955
Everyone i've ever met.

422
00:35:42,717 --> 00:35:44,613
Well, they sure don't act like it.

423
00:35:44,614 --> 00:35:47,120
Most of them have forgotten what it means...

424
00:35:47,154 --> 00:35:49,164
Or even that they were.

425
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,196
That's what happens when
you go to hell, dean.

426
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:55,134
That's what hell is...

427
00:35:55,228 --> 00:35:57,416
Forgetting what you are.

428
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:01,426
Philosophy lesson from a demon.
I'll pass, thanks.

429
00:36:01,454 --> 00:36:04,964
It's not philosophy. It's not a metaphor.

430
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,098
There's a real fire in the pit,

431
00:36:08,351 --> 00:36:10,773
agonies you can't even imagine.

432
00:36:10,774 --> 00:36:13,440
No, i saw "hellraiser. " I get the gist.

433
00:36:14,263 --> 00:36:16,967
Actually, they got that pretty close...

434
00:36:17,022 --> 00:36:19,257
Except for all the custom leather.

435
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,720
The answer is yes, by the way.

436
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:30,132
Sorry?

437
00:36:30,243 --> 00:36:32,919
Yes, the same thing will happen to you.

438
00:36:34,014 --> 00:36:35,966
It might take centuries, but

439
00:36:35,967 --> 00:36:39,930
sooner or later, hell will
burn away your humanity.

440
00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:43,283
Every hell-Bound soul,

441
00:36:43,299 --> 00:36:46,360
everyone, turns into something else.

442
00:36:46,806 --> 00:36:49,838
Turns you into us, so, yeah...

443
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,950
Yeah, you can count on it.

444
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,310
There's no way of saving
me from the pit, is there?

445
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,680
No.

446
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,250
Why'd you tell sam that you could?

447
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,189
So he would talk to me.

448
00:37:15,228 --> 00:37:17,610
You winchesters can be pretty bigoted,

449
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,750
and i needed something
to help him get past the...

450
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:21,310
The demon thing?

451
00:37:23,607 --> 00:37:25,560
That's pretty hard to get past.

452
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,847
Look at you...

453
00:37:30,755 --> 00:37:32,558
Trying to be all stoic.

454
00:37:34,055 --> 00:37:35,989
My god, it's heartbreaking.

455
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:37,710
Why are you telling me all this?

456
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,179
I need your help.

457
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,250
- Help with what?
- With sam.

458
00:37:43,816 --> 00:37:46,004
The way you stuck that demon tonight

459
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:48,673
it was pretty tough.

460
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,528
Sam's almost there, but not quite.

461
00:37:52,017 --> 00:37:54,374
You need to help me get him ready...

462
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:57,291
For life without you.

463
00:37:57,292 --> 00:38:00,174
To fight this war on his own.

464
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,352
Ruby.

465
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:11,040
Why do you want us to win?

466
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,857
Isn't it obvious?

467
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,211
I'm not like them.

468
00:38:22,338 --> 00:38:24,253
I don't know why.

469
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,986
I wish i was, but i'm not.

470
00:38:28,817 --> 00:38:30,980
I remember what it's like.

471
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,785
What what's like?

472
00:38:34,109 --> 00:38:35,781
Being human.
