1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,000
The Road So Far

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,700
Let me guess, you are oferring your own soul?

3
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,400
All you got to do is bringing Sam back

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,400
- How long have you get
- one year

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,200
Let Dean out of this deal right now

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,700
I got a boss like everybody

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,900
Who holds the contract?

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,600
I can't tell you.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,000
There is a new leader rising in the west

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,700
doesn't like you very much.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,400
Her name is Lilith

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,600
- I know about your deal, Dean.
- Who told you that?

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,300
The demon that holds it.
She holds mine, too.

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,000
- She?
- Her name's Lilith.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So, this is Ruby, huh?

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,900
She's a demon, Sam.

17
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,900
They want us dead.
We want them dead.

18
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,600
what kind of blade could kill a demon?

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,300
yesterday, i'd have said
There was no such thing.

20
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,300
Yellow eyes had some
Pretty big plans for you, Sam.

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,600
You're specialn that
E.s.p.-vision kind of way.

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,400
No, that stuff's
Not happening anymore.

23
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,400
Black dogs? They're seeing
Hellhounds -- demonic pit bulls.

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,500
- There's no way of saving me, is there?
- No.

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,300
I don't want to die.I don't wanna go to hell.

26
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,500
We will find a way to save you.

27
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,400
You're gonna die! 
This is what you're gonna become!

28
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
now

29
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,500
(hellhounds)

30
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
Dig up anything good?

31
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,100
No. Nothing good.

32
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,900
Well, Bobby has, finally.

33
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,200
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,500
A way to find Lilith.

35
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,600
Wow. With just, uh, 30 hours to go.

36
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,500
Hey, why don't we just make
A t.j. Run, you know?

37
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,900
Some seÑOritas, cervezas?

38
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,900
We could -- what's spanish
For "donkey show"?

39
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,400
So, if we do save you...

40
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,000
Let's never do that.

41
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,900
Hey, hey, Dean...

42
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,500
Look, we're cuttinit cse,I know.

43
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,300
But we are gonna get this done.

44
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,300
I don't care What it take

45
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,000
You are not gonna go to hell.

46
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,700
I'm not gonna let you.

47
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,000
I swear.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Everything's gonna be okay.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,400
Yeah, okay.

00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,500
So, you got a name?

54
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,600
That's the whole kit and caboodle.

55
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,100
With the right name,The right ritual,

00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,700
Ain't nothing You can't suss out.

57
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,200
Like the town Lilith in?

58
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,200
When I get it done. We will know it straight.

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,500
New Harmony, Indiana.

61
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,100
And we have a winner.

62
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,500
All right. Let's go

63
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,900
whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hold on.

64
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,700
Just holster it up, There, tex.

65
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,000
- What's the problem?
- "what's the problem"?

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,700
Come on, where do i begin?

67
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,300
I mean, first of all,We don't even know
if Lilith actually holds my deal.

68
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,600
We are going off Ofela's intel?

69
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,000
Now, when that bit
The air comes out crooked, okay

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,400
Second, even if we could
Get to Lilith, we have to gank her.

71
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,400
And third, isn't this the same Lilith
that wants your giayoon a pike?

72
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,600
Should i continue?

73
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,500
Ain't you just bringing down the room?

74
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,600
- Well, it's a gift.
- I'm sorry.

75
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,000
So, then, what are we
Supposed to do, Dean?

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,600
Well, just 'cause i got to die
Doesn't mean you have to, okay?

77
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,500
Either we go in smart
Or we don't go in at all.

78
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,400
Okay, fine.That's the case,
I have the answer.

79
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
- You do?
- Yeah.

80
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,200
A surefire way to confirm it's Lilith

81
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,200
And a way to get us
A bona fide demon-killing ginsu.

82
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,500
Damn it, Sam, no.

83
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,200
We are so past arguing.

84
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,600
Dean, i am summoning Ruby.

85
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,400
The hell you are!
We got enough problems as it is.

86
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,300
Exactly. And we got no time
And no choice, either.

87
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,900
Come on, man, she is the miss universe
Of lying skanks, okay?

88
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,700
She told you that she could
Save me, huh? Lie!

89
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,300
She seems know everything about Lilith

90
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,700
But forgot to mention --
oh,Right -- Lilith owns my soul!

91
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,900
Okay, fine, she's a liar.
She's still got that knife.

92
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,400
- Dean?
- For all we know,she works for Lilith.

93
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,500
Give me another option Dean.

94
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,900
- Tell me what else
- Sam is right.

95
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,600
No! Damn it!

96
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,000
Just no.

97
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,400
We are not gonna make the same
Mistakes all over again.

98
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,000
You guys want to save me,
Find something else.

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Where you going, Bobby?

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,200
I guess to...

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Find something else

102
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,000
Ad constringendum,

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,700
Ad ligandum eos pariter Et solvendum.

104
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:03,200
Et ad congregantum eos coram me.

105
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,100
You know, Phones work, too.

106
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,900
Hey, Sam.

107
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,800
How's tricks?

108
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,100
How do you get around so fast?

109
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,100
I got the super bowl jetpack.

110
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,900
So...

111
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,700
You called?

112
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,400
Did you know?

113
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,200
I'm gonna need a tiny bit more.

114
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,800
About Dean's deal --
That Lilith holds the contract.

115
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,100
Yes. I did.

116
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,900
And, what, you didn't think that was important?

117
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,100
- You weren't ready.
- For what?

118
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,000
If i told you,you two yahoos

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,100
Would have just charged
After her half-cocked,

120
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,600
And Lilith would have peeled the meat

121
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,100
From your pretty, pretty faces.

122
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,000
Well, we're ready now.

123
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,700
I want your knife.

124
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,800
You're right about one thing.

125
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,300
You <i>are</i> ready.

126
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,800
And now's the time, too

127
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Lilith's guard's down.

128
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,000
Is that so?

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
She's on shore leave,
A little r&r.

130
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,100
What the hell does that ?

131
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,100
Trust me. You don't wanna know.

132
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,500
You didn't lose
Those hex bags i gave you?

133
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,500
- We got 'em.
 -Good. Then she won't sense you're coming.

134
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,200
So, you'll give us the knife?

135
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,000
No.

136
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,300
But you just said --

137
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,300
You want to charge in
With one little pigsticker?

138
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,200
It's a waste of a true-blue window,

139
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,600
Like hitting hitler
With that exploding briefcase -- forget it.

140
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Ok, then how?

141
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,300
I know you wanna save your brother, Sam.

142
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,700
No, you don't.

143
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,900
You told Dean you couldn't.

144
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,600
You have been lying to me all along!

145
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
So, just give me your damn knife!

146
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,900
You're not the one that i've been lying to.

147
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,900
- Oh, so you can save him?
- No.

148
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,700
But <i>you</i> can.

149
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,600
What?

150
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Sam, you've got some god-given talent.

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,600
Well, not <i>god</i> given,
But you get the gist.

152
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,800
All that psychic crap?

153
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,300
That's gone ever since
Yellow eyes died.

154
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,900
Not gone.

155
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,800
Dormant.

156
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,100
And not just visions,either.

157
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,100
Why do you think Lilith is so scared of you?

158
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,600
Right, she's scared of me.

159
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,500
If you wanted, you could wipe her off the map
Without moving a muscle.

160
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,200
- I don't believe you.
- It's the truth.

161
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,600
And you decided to tell me this just now?

162
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,000
Um...demon.

163
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
"manipulative" is kind of
In the job description.

164
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,000
The fact is, is that you never
Would have considered it,

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
- Not until you were --
- Desperate enough?

166
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,300
You don't like being different.

167
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,800
You hate the way Dean
Looks at you sometimes,

168
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Like you're some sort of sideshow freak.

169
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,000
But suck it up because we got
A lot of ground to cover,

170
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,200
And we got to do it fast.

171
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,700
But we <i>can</i> do it.

172
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,000
Look,call me a bitch and hate me if you want.

173
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But i have never lied to you, Sam.

174
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,000
Not ever.

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,800
And i'telling you --

176
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,100
You can save your brother.

177
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
And i can show you how.

178
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,700
So, that's you, huh?

179
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,100
Our slutty little yoda.

180
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,000
Dean.

181
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,600
Charming as ever.

182
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,900
Oh, i knew you'd show up...

183
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,900
'Cause i knew Sam wouldn't listen!

184
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,900
But you're not gonna
Teach him anything.

185
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,000
You understand me?
Over my dead body.

186
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,400
Oh. Well, you're right about that.

187
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,700
What you are gonna do
Is give me that knife.

188
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,700
Then you can go crawl back
Into whatever slop you came from

189
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,100
And never bother me
Or my brother again.Are we clear?

190
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,000
Your brother is carrying
A bomb inside of him,

191
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,900
And we'd be stupid not to use it.

192
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,700
Dean, look,Just hold on --

193
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,200
Sam, don't. Come on, man.
What are you, blind?

194
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,500
Can't you see That this is a trick?

195
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,100
- That's not true.
- She wants you to givin

196
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,500
To this whole demonic,
Psychic whatever, okay?

197
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,400
Hell, she probably Wants you to 
become her little "antichrist superstar."

198
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
I want Lilith dead.

199
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
- That's all.
- Why?

200
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,600
I've told you why.

201
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,800
Oh, right, yeah.Because you were human once,

202
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,500
And you liked kittens
And long walks on the beach.

203
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,300
You know, i am so sick
Of proving myself to you.

204
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,300
You want to save yourself,
This is how,

205
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,000
You dumb, spineless dick!

206
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,600
Whoa! Ruby, hey!

207
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,700
What the hell are you grinning at?

208
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,000
Missing something?

209
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,500
I'll kill you,You son of a bitch.

210
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,200
Like i said...

211
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,000
I knew you'd come.

212
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,000
Wait!

213
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,800
You're just gonna leave me here?

214
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,100
Let's go, Sam.

215
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,400
Oh, so, you're just too stupid
To live, is that it?

216
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,300
Then fine.You deserve hell.

217
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,900
I wish i could be there, Dean.

218
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,500
I wish i could smell the flesh
Sizzle off your bones!

219
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,100
I wish i could be there
To hear you scream!

220
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,000
And i wish you'd
Shut your piehole,

221
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,500
But we don't always get what we want.

222
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,200
What, you gonna let Ruby
Rot down there?

223
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
That's the idea.

224
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,200
Dean, what if, uh...

225
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,700
what if Ruby is right?

226
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,800
What if i <i>can</i> take Lilith

227
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,800
Quit looking at me like that.

228
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,200
What, are you goe Her the "carrie" stare,
And Lilith goes poof?

229
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,300
I don't know what Ruby meant.

230
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,000
you know, maybe we should just go and ask her

231
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,700
Sam, you wanted the knife.
I got you the knife.

232
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,200
Dean, just listen to me for a second.

233
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,600
Last time, Lilith snapped her fingers

234
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,900
And put 30 demons on our ass,
and all we got's one little knife?

235
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,800
I mean, like you said, we go in
Smart or we don't go in at all.

236
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,700
Well, this ain't smart.

237
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,800
We got one shot at this, Dean --
Just one.

238
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,700
So, if there's A surefire way,

239
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,800
They maybe we should Just talk about it.

240
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,300
Sam, we are not gonna make
The same mistake all over again.

241
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,000
You said that,
But what does that even mean?

242
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,300
Don't you see a pattern here?

243
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,900
Dad's deal,My deal, now this?

244
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,400
Every time one of us is up to the crick
The other is begging to sell their soul

245
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,400
That's all this is, man.

246
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,800
Ruby's jrut jerking your chain down the road.

247
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,600
You know what's it's paved with,
And you know where it's going.

248
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Dean.

249
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,500
What are you afraid's gonna happen?

250
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,700
This is me.I can handle it.

251
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,100
And if it'll save you --

252
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,500
Why even risk it?

253
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,000
Because you're my brother.

254
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,600
Because you did the same thing for me.

255
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,100
i know.

256
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
And look how that turned out.

257
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,300
All i'm saying...

258
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,300
Sammy, all i'm saying is
That you're my weak pot

259
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,000
You are.

260
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,700
And i'm yours.

261
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,000
You don't mean that.
We're -- we're family.

262
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I know.

263
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,900
And those evil son
Of bitches know it, too.

264
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,300
I mean, what we'll do For each other,
 you know, How far we will go --

265
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,000
They're using that against us.

266
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So, what, we just stop
Looking out for each other?

267
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,900
no. we stop Being martyrs, man.

268
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,600
We stop spreading it for these demons.

269
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Take this knife.

270
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,000
And we go after Lilith our way,
The way dad taught us to.

271
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Ane go down,Then, uh...

272
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,800
Then we go down swinging.

273
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,500
What do you think?

274
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,200
I think you totally should have 
been jam"eye of the tiger"there.

275
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,500
Oh, bite me.

276
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:41,000
I totally rehearsed That s bitch too.

277
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,600
So, Indiana, huh?

278
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,900
Yeah, where Lilith iIs on shore leave.

279
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yeah, i guess.

- Hey, Pat.

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,200
How's that granddaughter of yours?

284
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,400
Homesick, poor thing.

Well, you give her
A big old hug from me and Judy.

And you intend to use it without me?

330

Do i look like
A ditchable prom date to you?

331
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,100
No, bobby, of course not.

332
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,200
This is about me and Sam, okay?

333
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,200
This isn't your fight.

334
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,800
The hell it isn't!

335
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,100
Family don't end with blood, boy.

336
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,100
Besides, you need me.

337
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,700
- Bobby --
- You're playing wounded.

338
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,000
Tell me, how many hallucinations you ever had so far

339
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,300
How'd you know?

340
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,300
Because that's what happens
when you got hellhounds on your butt,

341
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,000
And because i'm smart.

342
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,000

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,200
You're not gonna bust out
The misty goodbye speech, okay?

351
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,300
I mean, if this is

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Dean just killed a demon.

381
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,800
How'd you know?

382
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
I just knew.

383
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,500
I could see its face,
Its real face under that one.

385
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,900
I am seeing all kinds of things lately,
but nothing like this.

386
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,800
Actually, it's not all that crazy.

If she knows we're here,
We're dead before we started.

530
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,600
I wouldn't wish this upon my enemy.

00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,800
Hellhound.

00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,000
You want to die?

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,500
It's now in Ruby.

540
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,500
It's not Ruby.

541
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,200
How long have you been in her?

542
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
Not long...

543
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,500
But i like it.

544
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,500
It's all grown-up and pretty.

545
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
And where's Ruby?

546
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
She was a very bad girl 
so i sent her far far away,
