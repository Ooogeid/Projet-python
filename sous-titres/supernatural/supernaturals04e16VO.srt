1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,393
Lilith is trying to break the 66 seals
to free Lucifer from hell.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,965
- Who are you?
- Castiel. I'm an angel of the Lord.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,300
- Anna, you all right?
- I remember now who I am.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,682
I'm an angel.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,400
You can't run...

6
00:00:21,097 --> 00:00:21,880
Alastair.

7
00:00:22,143 --> 00:00:24,444
This is Uriel, a specialist.

8
00:00:24,604 --> 00:00:26,863
Pamela Barnes,
best damn psychic in the state.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,495
He took me off the rack,
and I tortured souls, and I liked it.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,955
No matter how many people I save,

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,800
I can't fill this hole.

12
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:40,580
It's not the psychic thing
I got a problem with.

13
00:00:40,745 --> 00:00:43,980
Yeah, I know what you got
a problem with, but tough.

14
00:00:44,123 --> 00:00:45,677
- It's the only way.
- No.

15
00:00:46,164 --> 00:00:48,593
I know what you did
to that demon, Sam.

16
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,100
Goodbye, sister.

17
00:02:07,137 --> 00:02:08,131
What the hell?

18
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:30,844
Saison 4 Episode 16
<i>On the Head of a Pin</i>

19
00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:33,291
Synchro originale: www.1000fr.com
Resynchro VO: baba

20
00:02:43,637 --> 00:02:45,500
Ruby will meet us outside Cheyenne.

21
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,300
She's been tracking some leads.

22
00:02:47,914 --> 00:02:50,144
She's not exactly
on your christmas list, but

23
00:02:50,227 --> 00:02:52,842
- if she can help us get to Lilith...
- Man, work with Ruby, don't.

24
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:54,803
I don't really give a rat's ass.

25
00:02:55,303 --> 00:02:56,680
What's your problem?

26
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,266
Pamela didn't want anything to do
with this, we dragged her back into it.

27
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,268
- She knew what was at stake.
- Oh, yeah, saving the world.

28
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,973
And we're doing such
a damn good job of it.

29
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,600
I'm tired of burying friends, sam.

30
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,857
Look, if we catch a fresh trail...

31
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,638
We follow it. I know.

32
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:16,991
Like I said, I'm just getting tired.

33
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,000
Well, get angry.

34
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,300
Home, crappy home.

35
00:03:28,754 --> 00:03:31,585
Winchester and Winchester.

36
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,091
Come on!

37
00:03:33,402 --> 00:03:34,342
You are needed.

38
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,519
Needed?

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,387
We just got back from needed!

40
00:03:37,547 --> 00:03:39,180
Now, you mind your tone with me.

41
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,980
No, you mind your damn tone with us.

42
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:43,700
We just got back
from Pamela's funeral.

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Pamela... You know, psychic Pamela?

44
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,544
You remember her.

45
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,380
Cass, you remember her.
You burned her eyes out. Remember that?

46
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,694
Good times!

47
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,030
Yeah, then she died saving
one of your precious seals.

48
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,580
So, maybe you can stop pushing us
around like chess pieces

49
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,192
for five freaking minutes!

50
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,371
We raised you out of hell
for our purposes.

51
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:07,166
Yeah, and what were those again?
What exactly do you want from me?

52
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:08,835
Start with gratitude.

53
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:12,480
Dean, we know this is difficult
to understand.

54
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,423
And we...

55
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:18,303
... don't care.

56
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,728
Now, seven angels
have been murdered...

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,480
All of them from our garrison.

58
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:30,780
The last one was killed tonight.

59
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,608
Demons?

60
00:04:33,897 --> 00:04:35,590
- How they doing it?
- We don't know.

61
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,906
I'm sorry, but what do you want us
to do about it?

62
00:04:38,066 --> 00:04:41,480
A demon with the juice to ice angels
has to be out of our league, right?

63
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,620
We can handle the demons,
thank you very much.

64
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,454
Once we find whoever it is.

65
00:04:49,077 --> 00:04:50,735
So, you need our help...

66
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,240
hunting a demon?

67
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,900
Not quite.

68
00:04:56,598 --> 00:04:57,821
We have Alastair.

69
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,206
Great. He should be able
to name your triggerman.

70
00:05:00,326 --> 00:05:02,305
But he won't talk.

71
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,805
Alastair's will is very strong.

72
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,080
We've arrived at an impasse.

73
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,521
He's like a black belt in torture.
You guys are out of your league.

74
00:05:10,913 --> 00:05:13,066
That's why we've come
to his student.

75
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,598
You happen to be the most
qualified interrogator we've got.

76
00:05:22,335 --> 00:05:23,493
You're our best hope.

77
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:25,131
No.

78
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:26,788
No way.

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,582
You can't ask me to do this,
Cass... Not this.

80
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,149
Who said anything...

81
00:05:39,926 --> 00:05:41,300
about asking?

82
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,100
Damn it!

83
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:56,300
This devil's trap is old enochian.

84
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,300
He's bound completely.

85
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
Fascinating.

86
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:07,078
- Where's the door?
- Where are you going?

87
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,807
Hitch back to Cheyenne,
thank you very much.

88
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,180
Angels are dying, boy.

89
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,796
Everybody's dying these days.

90
00:06:17,283 --> 00:06:20,780
Hey, I get it. You're all powerful.
You can make me do whatever you want,

91
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,300
- But you can't make me do this.
- This is too much to ask.

92
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
I know.

93
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,800
But we have to ask it.

94
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,952
I want to talk to Cass alone.

95
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,825
I think I'll go seek... Revelation.

96
00:06:47,388 --> 00:06:49,120
We might have some further orders.

97
00:06:50,562 --> 00:06:52,206
Get some doughnuts while you're out.

98
00:06:56,109 --> 00:06:58,212
This one just won't quit, will he?

99
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,926
I think I'm starting
to like you, boy.

100
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,638
You don't walk enough.
You're gonna get flabby.

101
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:13,394
I'm starting to think Junkless has
a better sense of humor than you do.

102
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:16,307
Uriel is the funniest angel
in the garrison.

103
00:07:16,797 --> 00:07:17,732
Ask anyone.

104
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,905
What's going on?

105
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:28,326
Since when does Uriel put
a leash on you?

106
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,634
My superiors have begun to question

107
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:32,663
- my sympathies.
- Your sympathies?

108
00:07:33,075 --> 00:07:35,800
I was getting too close
to the humans in my charge.

109
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,626
You.

110
00:07:37,774 --> 00:07:41,757
They feel I've begun to express
emotions, the doorways to doubt.

111
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,900
This can impair my judgment.

112
00:07:46,763 --> 00:07:49,100
Tell Uriel or whoever...

113
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,686
... you do not want me
doing this, trust me.

114
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,894
Want it? No.

115
00:07:59,328 --> 00:08:01,025
But I've been told we need it.

116
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,200
You ask me to open that door
and walk through it...

117
00:08:08,284 --> 00:08:10,100
You will not like
who walks back out.

118
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,800
For what it's worth...

119
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,037
I would give anything
not to have you do this.

120
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,900
Heaven.

121
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,024
* i'm in heaven *

122
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,769
* and my heart beats so that *

123
00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:47,991
* I can hardly speak *

124
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,034
* I seem to find
the happiness I seek *

125
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,247
* when we're out together dancing *

126
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,199
* cheek to cheek. *

127
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,409
I'm sorry.

128
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:16,183
This is a very serious,

129
00:09:16,303 --> 00:09:19,089
very emotional situation for you.

130
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:24,620
I shouldn't laugh. It's just that,
I mean, are they serious?

131
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,400
They sent you to torture me?

132
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,684
You got one chance.

133
00:09:33,622 --> 00:09:34,327
One.

134
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,492
Tell me who is killing the angels.

135
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,600
I want a name.

136
00:09:39,055 --> 00:09:43,043
You think I'll see
all your scary toys

137
00:09:43,163 --> 00:09:44,795
and spill my guts?

138
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,800
You'll spill your guts,
one way or another.

139
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,843
I just didn't want to ruin my shoes.

140
00:09:53,255 --> 00:09:54,555
Now answer the question.

141
00:09:55,258 --> 00:09:56,990
Or what? You'll work me over?

142
00:09:59,577 --> 00:10:01,548
But then, maybe...

143
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,023
you don't want to.

144
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,414
Maybe...

145
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,276
* you're scared to *

146
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,380
- I'm here, aren't I?
- Not entirely.

147
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,869
You left part of yourself
back in the pit.

148
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:18,871
Let's see if we can...

149
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,699
get the two of you back
together again, shall we?

150
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,466
- You're gonna be disappointed.
- You have not disappointed me so far.

151
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
Come on.

152
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,999
You got to want a little payback

153
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:39,934
for everything I did to you...

154
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,956
For all the pokes and prods.

155
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
No?

156
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,061
Then...

157
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,365
how about for all the things
I did to your daddy?

158
00:11:02,483 --> 00:11:03,900
I can still smell them.

159
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,000
Seriously, Sam, I'm not exactly dying
to tangle with angels again.

160
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:11,980
I need you to find out
where they took Dean.

161
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,514
Not sure I see the problem.

162
00:11:14,522 --> 00:11:17,054
You know they have Alastair
strung up six ways from sunday.

163
00:11:18,382 --> 00:11:21,080
Dean cuts himself a slice,
Al's reduced to a quivering heap,

164
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,269
the good guys get the goods.
What's wrong with that?

165
00:11:23,935 --> 00:11:24,895
He can't do it.

166
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,080
Look, i get it. You don't want him
going all torture master again.

167
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,984
No, I mean, he can't do it.

168
00:11:30,853 --> 00:11:32,111
He can't get the job done.

169
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,363
Something happened
to him downstairs, Ruby.

170
00:11:35,266 --> 00:11:37,366
He's not what he used to be.
He's not strong enough.

171
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,966
And you are?

172
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,300
I will be.

173
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,780
Had your pop on my rack
for close to a century.

174
00:11:45,951 --> 00:11:47,180
You can't stall forever.

175
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,980
John Winchester...
Made quite a name for himself.

176
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,888
A hundred years.

177
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:56,645
And after each session, I'd make him
the same offer I made you.

178
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,809
I'd put down my blade
if he picked one up.

179
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,800
Just give me the demon's name,
Alastair.

180
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,762
But...

181
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,872
he said, "nein"...

182
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:09,558
... each and every time.

183
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:13,800
Damned if I couldn't break him.

184
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:17,000
Pulled out all the stops.

185
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,988
But John... he was...

186
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,619
made of something unique.

187
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,489
The stuff of heroes.

188
00:12:25,268 --> 00:12:27,249
And then came Dean.

189
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:29,502
Dean Winchester.

190
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:32,200
I thought I was up against it again.

191
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,790
But daddy's little girl...

192
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:38,196
he broked.

193
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,191
He broked in 30.

194
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,960
Just not the man your daddy
wanted you to be, huh, Dean?

195
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:52,983
Now...

196
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:57,580
Now we're getting somewhere.

197
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,241
Holy water?

198
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:02,080
Come on!

199
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,881
Grasshopper, you're gonna
have to get creative to impress me.

200
00:13:06,823 --> 00:13:08,328
You know something, Alastair?

201
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,872
I could still dream,

202
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,420
even in hell.

203
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,047
And over and over and over,
you know what I dreamt?

204
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,883
I dreamt of this moment.

205
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,000
And believe me...

206
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,600
... i got a few ideas.

207
00:13:49,102 --> 00:13:50,500
Let's get started.

208
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,209
Let me know if you want some more.
There's plenty left.

209
00:14:19,188 --> 00:14:21,757
Go directly to hell.

210
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,647
Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.

211
00:14:44,866 --> 00:14:46,800
Relax. The fire is our friend.

212
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,225
Besides, the only part of the map
we need

213
00:14:50,146 --> 00:14:51,519
is the "where's Dean" part.

214
00:14:51,897 --> 00:14:52,603
Out.

215
00:14:55,705 --> 00:14:57,693
There. Your brother is there.

216
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:03,030
It's great angels aren't concerned
with hiding their dirty business.

217
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,942
Not used to being spied on.
I mean,

218
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:07,201
who'd be stupid enough to try?

219
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,204
It's been weeks.

220
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,600
I need it.

221
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,479
You don't seem too happy about it.

222
00:15:14,702 --> 00:15:16,288
You think I want to do this?

223
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,500
This is the last thing I...

224
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,900
But I need to be strong enough.

225
00:15:33,394 --> 00:15:34,400
It's okay.

226
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,400
It's okay, Sammy.

227
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,149
You can have it.

228
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,600
It's okay, Sam.

229
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,380
There's that little pig poker.

230
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,269
I wondered where it went.

231
00:16:24,453 --> 00:16:28,375
Do you really think
this is gonna fix you?

232
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,500
Give you closure?

233
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:35,444
That is sad.

234
00:16:36,822 --> 00:16:38,250
That's really sad.

235
00:16:39,174 --> 00:16:40,290
Sad, sad.

236
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,700
I...

237
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,706
carved you into

238
00:16:56,826 --> 00:17:00,065
a new animal, Dean.

239
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,700
There is no...

240
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,903
going back.

241
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,300
Maybe you're right.

242
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,200
But now it's my turn to carve.

243
00:17:39,498 --> 00:17:40,266
Anna.

244
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,726
Hello, Castiel.

245
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,106
Your human body.

246
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,212
It was destroyed. I know.

247
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,384
But...

248
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,100
I guess I'm sentimental.

249
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,400
Called in some old favors, and...

250
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,400
You shouldn't be here.

251
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,200
We still have orders to kill you.

252
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,717
Somehow, I don't think you'll try.

253
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,400
Where's Uriel?

254
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,900
He went to receive revelation.

255
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Right.

256
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:42,408
It's your professionalism
that I respect.

257
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,300
Why are you letting Dean do this?

258
00:18:56,849 --> 00:18:58,678
He's doing God's work.

259
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,100
Torturing?

260
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,019
That's God's work?

261
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,980
Stop him, Cass, please.

262
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,608
Before you ruin
the one real weapon you have.

263
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,739
Who are we to question
the will of God?

264
00:19:11,189 --> 00:19:12,280
Unless...

265
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,864
this isn't his will.

266
00:19:14,024 --> 00:19:16,617
- Then where do the orders come from?
- I don't know.

267
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:18,700
One of our superiors maybe.

268
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,621
But not him.

269
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:26,960
Who's murdering the angels?

270
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,600
The father you love...

271
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:34,803
You think he wants this?
You think he'd ask this of you?

272
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,180
You think this is righteous?

273
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:44,700
What you're feeling,

274
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,190
it's called doubt.

275
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,868
These orders are wrong,

276
00:20:04,116 --> 00:20:05,123
And you know it.

277
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:07,125
But you can do the right thing.

278
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:09,461
You're afraid, Cass.

279
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:10,754
I was, too.

280
00:20:10,953 --> 00:20:13,857
But together, we can stop...

281
00:20:13,977 --> 00:20:14,985
Together?

282
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,865
I am nothing like you.

283
00:20:21,605 --> 00:20:22,696
You fell.

284
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:24,737
Go.

285
00:20:26,126 --> 00:20:26,940
Cass.

286
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:30,446
Go.

287
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,208
Just not getting deep enough.

288
00:20:49,285 --> 00:20:51,211
Well, you lack the resources.

289
00:20:52,355 --> 00:20:53,987
Reality is just...

290
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:57,095
I don't know...
too concrete up here.

291
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:02,312
Honestly, Dean...

292
00:21:03,608 --> 00:21:07,142
you have no idea
how bad it really was...

293
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:11,754
and what you really did for us.

294
00:21:14,386 --> 00:21:15,152
Shut up.

295
00:21:15,445 --> 00:21:17,583
The whole bloody thing, Dean.

296
00:21:17,703 --> 00:21:20,490
The reason Lilith wanted you there
in the first place.

297
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,452
Okay, then I'll just make you
shut up.

298
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,243
Something caught in my throat.

299
00:21:54,403 --> 00:21:56,068
I think it's my throat.

300
00:21:57,142 --> 00:21:58,397
Well, strap in.

301
00:21:58,903 --> 00:22:01,799
'Cause I'm just starting
to have fun.

302
00:22:03,385 --> 00:22:04,361
You know...

303
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:07,170
it was supposed to be your father.

304
00:22:08,474 --> 00:22:10,301
He was supposed to bring it on.

305
00:22:11,381 --> 00:22:13,789
But in the end, it was you.

306
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:15,847
Bring what on?

307
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:20,812
Every night, the same offer,
remember?

308
00:22:21,393 --> 00:22:22,979
Same as your father.

309
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:27,078
And finally you said, "sign me up."

310
00:22:29,177 --> 00:22:33,105
Oh, the first time
you picked up my razor,

311
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:35,915
the first time

312
00:22:36,035 --> 00:22:38,041
you sliced into

313
00:22:38,161 --> 00:22:40,468
that weeping bitch...

314
00:22:42,913 --> 00:22:44,796
that was the first seal.

315
00:22:56,012 --> 00:22:57,084
You're lying.

316
00:22:59,751 --> 00:23:01,440
"And it is written

317
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,428
"that the first seal shall be broken

318
00:23:04,734 --> 00:23:08,098
"when a righteous man
sheds blood in hell.

319
00:23:08,912 --> 00:23:10,164
"As he breaks,

320
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:13,310
so shall it break."

321
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:26,658
We had to break the first seal
before any others.

322
00:23:26,818 --> 00:23:30,148
Only way to get the
dominoes to fall right.

323
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:33,634
Topple the one
at the front of the line.

324
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:41,923
When we win...

325
00:23:43,981 --> 00:23:46,664
when we bring on the apocalypse

326
00:23:46,784 --> 00:23:48,972
and burn this earth down...

327
00:23:50,342 --> 00:23:52,022
we'll owe it all to you...

328
00:23:54,611 --> 00:23:56,530
Dean Winchester.

329
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,448
Believe me, son.

330
00:24:07,577 --> 00:24:09,082
I wouldn't lie about this.

331
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,662
It's kind of a...

332
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:15,631
religious...

333
00:24:16,608 --> 00:24:19,127
sort of thing with me.

334
00:24:26,997 --> 00:24:27,706
No.

335
00:24:29,741 --> 00:24:31,456
I don't think you are lying.

336
00:24:36,091 --> 00:24:38,166
But even if the demons do win...

337
00:24:44,389 --> 00:24:46,063
... you won't be there to see it.

338
00:24:47,162 --> 00:24:49,991
You should talk to your plumber
about the pipes.

339
00:25:15,954 --> 00:25:18,067
You've got a lot to learn, boy,

340
00:25:18,187 --> 00:25:19,729
So I'll see you

341
00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:21,231
back in class,

342
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,483
bright and early,

343
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:25,341
monday morning.

344
00:25:33,653 --> 00:25:34,998
Oh, almost.

345
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:37,536
Looks like God is on my side today.

346
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,747
You know...

347
00:26:10,884 --> 00:26:13,112
like roaches, you celestials.

348
00:26:13,847 --> 00:26:16,661
I really wish I knew
how to kill you.

349
00:26:17,531 --> 00:26:19,612
But all I can do is

350
00:26:20,257 --> 00:26:22,042
send you back to heaven.

351
00:26:54,192 --> 00:26:56,530
Stupid pet tricks.

352
00:26:56,778 --> 00:26:58,536
Who's murdering the angels?

353
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,564
How are they doing it?

354
00:27:00,824 --> 00:27:03,416
You think I'm gonna tell you?

355
00:27:04,101 --> 00:27:05,387
Yeah, I do.

356
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:12,050
How are the demons killing angels?

357
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:14,562
I...

358
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:18,172
don't... know!

359
00:27:18,612 --> 00:27:19,326
Right.

360
00:27:21,428 --> 00:27:25,193
It's... not... us!

361
00:27:25,313 --> 00:27:28,517
We're... not doing it!

362
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:30,235
I don't believe you.

363
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:37,391
Lilith is not behind this.

364
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,533
She wouldn't kill seven angels.

365
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:45,265
She'd kill a hundred...

366
00:27:46,292 --> 00:27:48,169
a thousand...

367
00:27:54,849 --> 00:27:56,785
Oh, go ahead.

368
00:27:57,757 --> 00:27:59,384
Send me back...

369
00:28:00,274 --> 00:28:02,144
if you can.

370
00:28:03,676 --> 00:28:04,978
I'm stronger than that now.

371
00:28:07,158 --> 00:28:08,106
Now I can kill.

372
00:29:12,024 --> 00:29:14,422
Get in there and heal him.
Miracle... Now.

373
00:29:14,707 --> 00:29:17,623
- I can't.
- You and Uriel put him in there!

374
00:29:17,962 --> 00:29:20,685
Because you can't keep a
simple devil's trap together.

375
00:29:20,805 --> 00:29:22,803
I don't know what
happened. That trap...

376
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,017
It shouldn't have broken.
I am sorry.

377
00:29:26,177 --> 00:29:28,853
This whole thing was pointless.

378
00:29:29,146 --> 00:29:32,232
You understand that?
The demons aren't doing the hits.

379
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:34,359
Something else is
killing your soldiers.

380
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,152
Perhaps Alastair was lying.

381
00:29:36,439 --> 00:29:37,139
No.

382
00:29:37,751 --> 00:29:38,780
He wasn't.

383
00:29:56,807 --> 00:29:58,010
Castiel?

384
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,690
I received revelation
from our superiors.

385
00:30:06,277 --> 00:30:08,859
Our brothers and sisters are dying,
and they...

386
00:30:09,968 --> 00:30:12,726
they want us to stop hunting
the demon responsible.

387
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,073
Something is wrong up there.

388
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,403
I mean, can you feel it?

389
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:27,560
The murderers...
Maybe they aren't demonic.

390
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,579
Sam Winchester said the demons
have nothing to do with it.

391
00:30:31,892 --> 00:30:34,335
If not the demons, what could it be?

392
00:30:38,497 --> 00:30:39,771
The will of heaven.

393
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:44,345
We are failing, Uriel.
We are losing the war.

394
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,389
Perhaps the garrison
is being punished.

395
00:30:46,898 --> 00:30:49,684
- You think our father would...
- Maybe our father isn't giving

396
00:30:49,844 --> 00:30:51,280
the orders anymore.

397
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,410
Maybe there is something wrong.

398
00:31:00,211 --> 00:31:01,775
Well, I won't wait to be gutted.

399
00:31:10,307 --> 00:31:11,232
Anna.

400
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,003
Anna, please.

401
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:30,350
Decided to kill me after all?

402
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,200
I'm alone.

403
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,312
What do you want from me, Castiel?

404
00:31:34,749 --> 00:31:36,689
I'm considering disobedience.

405
00:31:38,511 --> 00:31:39,216
Good.

406
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,232
No. It isn't.

407
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,248
For the first time...

408
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,341
I feel.

409
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:49,702
It gets worse.

410
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:53,957
Choosing your own course of action,

411
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,366
it's confusing...

412
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:58,547
terrifying.

413
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,898
That's right.

414
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,846
You're too good for my help.

415
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,820
I'm just trash.

416
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,183
A walking blasphemy.

417
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,021
I don't know what to do.

418
00:32:17,756 --> 00:32:19,308
Please tell me what to do.

419
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:22,318
Like the old days?

420
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:24,980
No.

421
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,327
I'm sorry.

422
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,326
It's time to think for yourself.

423
00:33:21,204 --> 00:33:22,222
You called?

424
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,797
What do you say, Castiel?

425
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:26,752
Will you join me?

426
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:29,329
Will you fight with me?

427
00:33:29,449 --> 00:33:30,606
It's strange.

428
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,013
Strange how...

429
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,682
a leaky pipe

430
00:33:35,215 --> 00:33:37,060
can undo the work of angels

431
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,348
when we ourselves

432
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,940
are supppped to be
the agents of fate.

433
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,805
Alastair was much more powerful
than we had imagined.

434
00:33:45,925 --> 00:33:46,625
No.

435
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,235
No demon can overpower that trap.

436
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,220
I made it myself.

437
00:33:54,891 --> 00:33:56,871
We've been friends
for a long time, Uriel.

438
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:59,130
Fought by each others' sides,

439
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,626
served together away from home...

440
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,220
... for what seems like...

441
00:34:06,466 --> 00:34:07,215
forever.

442
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:10,224
We're brothers, Uriel.

443
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,687
Pay me that respect.
Tell me the truth.

444
00:34:13,965 --> 00:34:14,931
The truth is...

445
00:34:15,249 --> 00:34:16,933
the only thing
that can kill an angel...

446
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,090
is an other angel.

447
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:31,114
You.

448
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:33,329
I'm afraid so.

449
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:36,256
And you broke the devil's trap,

450
00:34:36,936 --> 00:34:39,202
set Alastair on Dean.

451
00:34:39,434 --> 00:34:42,041
Alastair should never
have been taken alive

452
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:44,818
Really inconvenient, Cass.

453
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,292
Yes, I did turn the screw a little.

454
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,003
Alastair should have killed Dean
and escaped.

455
00:34:50,123 --> 00:34:53,068
You should have gone on
happily scapegoating the demon.

456
00:34:53,188 --> 00:34:56,030
For the murders of our kin?

457
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,115
Not murders, Castiel.

458
00:34:59,376 --> 00:35:01,227
No. My work...

459
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:03,938
is conversion.

460
00:35:04,347 --> 00:35:05,982
How long have we waited here?

461
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,025
How long have we played this game

462
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,278
by rules that make no sense?

463
00:35:10,646 --> 00:35:12,253
It is our father's world.

464
00:35:12,373 --> 00:35:13,750
Our father?

465
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:17,489
He stopped being that,
if he ever was,

466
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,454
The moment he created them.

467
00:35:19,804 --> 00:35:20,954
Humanity.

468
00:35:21,742 --> 00:35:22,911
His favorites.

469
00:35:24,585 --> 00:35:26,962
His whining, puking larvae.

470
00:35:27,082 --> 00:35:29,127
Are you trying to convert me?

471
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,258
I wanted you to join me,
and I still do.

472
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,617
With you, we can be
powerful enough to...

473
00:35:34,737 --> 00:35:35,437
To?

474
00:35:35,999 --> 00:35:37,221
To raise our brother.

475
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,974
Lucifer.

476
00:35:40,617 --> 00:35:42,012
You do remember him.

477
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,593
How strong he was.

478
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,630
How beautiful.

479
00:35:51,854 --> 00:35:54,322
And he didn't bow to humanity.

480
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,726
He was punished for defending us.

481
00:35:57,549 --> 00:36:00,453
Now, if you want to believe
in something, Cass, believe in him.

482
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,330
Lucifer is not God.

483
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,810
God isn't God anymore.

484
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,627
He doesn't care what we do.

485
00:36:07,863 --> 00:36:09,550
I am proof of that.

486
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,530
But this?

487
00:36:16,363 --> 00:36:17,637
What were you gonna do?

488
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,390
Were you gonna kill
the whole garrison?

489
00:36:21,316 --> 00:36:23,434
I only killed the ones who said no.

490
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,688
Others have joined me, Cass.

491
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:30,590
Now, please, brother.
Don't fight me.

492
00:36:32,118 --> 00:36:33,113
Help me.

493
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,847
Help me spread the word.

494
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,423
Help me bring on the apocalypse.

495
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,120
All you have to do...

496
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:47,990
is be unafraid.

497
00:36:54,606 --> 00:36:57,519
For the first time in a long time,

498
00:37:01,442 --> 00:37:02,431
I am.

499
00:37:37,668 --> 00:37:39,595
You can't win, Uriel.

500
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,637
I still serve God.

501
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,056
You haven't even met the man!

502
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,560
There is no will!

503
00:37:49,622 --> 00:37:50,860
No wrath!

504
00:37:54,037 --> 00:37:55,746
No God!

505
00:38:00,747 --> 00:38:01,657
Maybe

506
00:38:02,178 --> 00:38:03,503
or maybe not.

507
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:07,121
But there's still me.

508
00:38:43,774 --> 00:38:44,940
Are you all right?

509
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,990
No thanks to you.

510
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,257
You need to be more careful.

511
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,980
You need to learn how to manage
a damn devil's trap.

512
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,120
That's not what I mean.

513
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,101
Uriel is dead.

514
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,131
- Was it the demons?
- It was disobedience.

515
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,840
He was working against us.

516
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,040
Is it true?

517
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,100
Did I break the first seal?

518
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,030
Did I start all this?

519
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,379
Yes.

520
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,592
When we discovered

521
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,457
Lilith's plan for you,

522
00:39:47,603 --> 00:39:49,500
we laid siege to hell,

523
00:39:50,481 --> 00:39:53,400
and we fought our way
to get to you before you...

524
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,895
jump-started the apocalypse.

525
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,233
But we were too late.

526
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,162
Why didn't you just
leave me there, then?

527
00:40:04,282 --> 00:40:05,323
It's not...

528
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,405
blame that falls on you, Dean.

529
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,410
It's fate.

530
00:40:15,477 --> 00:40:17,770
"And the righteous man who begins it

531
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:22,539
Is the only one who can finish it."

532
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,193
You have to stop it.

533
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,516
Lucifer?

534
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,493
The apocalypse?

535
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:41,700
What does that mean?

536
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:51,150
Don't you go disappearing
on me, you son of a bitch.

537
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,578
What does that mean?

538
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,663
- I don't know.
- Bull!

539
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,080
I don't.

540
00:40:58,315 --> 00:40:59,900
Dean, they don't tell me much.

541
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,660
I know...

542
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,717
how our fate rests with you.

543
00:41:09,226 --> 00:41:11,030
Well, then, you guys are screwed.

544
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:13,910
I can't do it, Cass.

545
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,846
It's too big.

546
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:18,521
Alastair was right.

547
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:20,600
I'm not all here.

548
00:41:21,334 --> 00:41:22,688
