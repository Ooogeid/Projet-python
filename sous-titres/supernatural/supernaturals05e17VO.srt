1
00:00:05,234 --> 00:00:06,534
- Dean!
- Lisa.

2
00:00:06,659 --> 00:00:08,676
You know
how I never mentioned my job?

3
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:10,051
This is my job.

4
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,762
Ben wouldn't be alive
if it wasn't for you.

5
00:00:12,943 --> 00:00:16,182
- You're welcome to stay.
- I can't. It's not my life.

6
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:21,187
There is someone besides Michael
strong enough to take on Lucifer.

7
00:00:21,499 --> 00:00:22,813
- Who's that?
- God.

8
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,816
- I'm gonna find God.
- I'm Joshua.

9
00:00:25,997 --> 00:00:28,694
- You talk to God?
- He knows the apocalypse has begun.

10
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,906
He just doesn't think
it's His problem.

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,908
- Not His problem?
- He's finished.

12
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:37,052
Just another deadbeat dad
with a bunch of excuses, right?

13
00:00:37,177 --> 00:00:38,537
Maybe Joshua was lying.

14
00:00:38,947 --> 00:00:40,497
I don't think he was.

15
00:00:40,622 --> 00:00:43,167
You son of a bitch.
I believed in...

16
00:00:45,461 --> 00:00:48,087
We'll find another way.
We can still stop all this, Dean.

17
00:00:48,212 --> 00:00:50,591
- How?
- I don't know, but we'll find it.

18
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:51,959
You and me.

19
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,230
We'll find it.

20
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,275
- Drive faster.
- I can't!

21
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:11,671
- Are you okay?
- I'm amazing.

22
00:01:12,012 --> 00:01:15,262
- You ever seen that many?
- No way. Not in one place.

23
00:01:15,387 --> 00:01:16,587
What the hell?

24
00:01:29,243 --> 00:01:30,243
Damn it!

25
00:02:18,926 --> 00:02:21,158
That's something
you don't see every day.

26
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,920
You two all right?

27
00:02:32,692 --> 00:02:34,392
- Peachy.
- Be careful.

28
00:02:34,924 --> 00:02:37,031
- It's dangerous around here.
- Wait!

29
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:40,073
- No need to thank us.
- No, hold up a sec!

30
00:02:40,198 --> 00:02:43,245
- Who are you?
- We're the sacrament lutheran militia.

31
00:02:44,474 --> 00:02:47,125
- Sorry, what?
- Those were demons,

32
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,812
and this is the apocalypse.

33
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:51,005
So... buckle up.

34
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,525
- We're in the same line of business.
- And among colleagues.

35
00:03:14,382 --> 00:03:15,903
That's a police-issued shotgun.

36
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:18,493
That truck is inspired.

37
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,591
Where'd you pick up this crap?

38
00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:23,452
You know, you...
Pick things up along the way.

39
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:29,166
Guys, come on. This whole corner
of the State is nuts with demon omens.

40
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,877
- We just wanna help.
- We're on the same team here.

41
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,555
Just talk to us.

42
00:03:40,314 --> 00:03:41,314
Follow us.

43
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,792
- Dylan, it's a church. Headphones off.
- Yes, ma'am.

44
00:04:24,643 --> 00:04:27,234
Who would've thought the
apocalypse could be so romantic?

45
00:04:30,598 --> 00:04:31,598
Marriage,

46
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,889
family, it's a blessing.

47
00:04:35,632 --> 00:04:37,632
Especially in times like this.

48
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:39,945
So hold on to that.

49
00:04:41,134 --> 00:04:42,134
Wedding?

50
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,657
Seriously?

51
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:48,917
We've had eight so far this week.

52
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:58,297
So, Rob tells me

53
00:04:58,777 --> 00:05:00,327
you boys hunt demons.

54
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:03,659
Yes, sir.

55
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,724
You missed a few.

56
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,535
Tell us about it.

57
00:05:11,806 --> 00:05:14,605
- Any idea why they're here?
- They sure seem to like us, though.

58
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:18,452
Follow me.

59
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:25,407
- So, you're a preacher.
- Not what you expected?

60
00:05:25,532 --> 00:05:27,082
Dude, you're packing.

61
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:28,526
Strange times.

62
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,552
Is that a 12-year-old
packing salt rounds?

63
00:05:38,677 --> 00:05:40,227
Everybody pitches in.

64
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,969
- The whole church?
- The whole town.

65
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:46,595
A town full of hunters? I don't know
whether to run or buy a condo.

66
00:05:46,975 --> 00:05:49,261
The demons were killing us.
We had to do something.

67
00:05:49,386 --> 00:05:51,767
- Why not call the national guard?
- We were told not to.

68
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,220
By who?

69
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,690
You're as locked and loaded
as we've ever seen.

70
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:00,973
And that exorcism was enochian.
Someone's telling you something.

71
00:06:02,303 --> 00:06:04,530
Look, I'm sorry. I can't discuss it.

72
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:06,532
- Dad, it's okay.
- Leah!

73
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,900
It's Sam and Dean Winchester.
They're safe.

74
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,999
I know all about them.

75
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:15,729
You do?

76
00:06:16,337 --> 00:06:17,937
Sure. From the angels.

77
00:06:19,485 --> 00:06:20,671
The angels. Awesome.

78
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:22,933
Don't worry.
They can't see you here.

79
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,980
The marks on your ribs, right?

80
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:30,848
So, you know all about us
because angels told you?

81
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:35,352
- Among other things.
- Like the exorcism spell.

82
00:06:35,868 --> 00:06:38,647
And they show me where the demons
are gonna be before it happens.

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,056
- How to fight back.
- Never been wrong.

84
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:42,181
Not once.

85
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:44,167
She's very special.

86
00:06:44,292 --> 00:06:46,792
Let me guess.
Before you see something,

87
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,950
you get a really bad migraine,
you see flashing lights?

88
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,540
- How'd you know?
- You're not our first prophet.

89
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,165
But you are the cutest.

90
00:06:59,714 --> 00:07:01,420
I mean that with total respect.

91
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,110
You've reached the voice mail of...

92
00:07:07,235 --> 00:07:10,485
I don't understand.
Why do you want me to say my name?

93
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,918
Cass, it's me.

94
00:07:17,043 --> 00:07:19,199
So, we are in Blue Earth, Minnesota,

95
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,680
and we could use a little help.

96
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:23,305
I hope you get this.

97
00:07:27,218 --> 00:07:28,793
- Busy night.
- I'm telling you,

98
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:31,533
since the end started,
it's been like one long last call.

99
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:34,796
- That round's on me.
- Thanks.

100
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,752
So, did you get a hold of Cass?

101
00:07:43,407 --> 00:07:45,507
I left him a message... I think.

102
00:07:46,026 --> 00:07:47,679
So, what's your theory?

103
00:07:47,944 --> 00:07:49,594
Why all the demon hits?

104
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:51,352
I don't know.

105
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:54,552
Gank the girl prophet, maybe?

106
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,477
What?

107
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,522
Just, these angels are sending
these people to do their dirty work.

108
00:08:04,182 --> 00:08:05,182
And?

109
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,278
And they could get ripped to shreds.

110
00:08:12,665 --> 00:08:15,065
We're all gonna die,
in like a month.

111
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:16,914
Maybe two. I mean it.

112
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,623
This is the end of the world.

113
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:23,113
But these people
aren't freaking out.

114
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:26,788
In fact, they're running
to the exits in an orderly fashion.

115
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:29,140
I don't know that
that's such a bad thing.

116
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:32,823
Who says they're all gonna die?

117
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,896
Whatever happened to us saving them?

118
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:47,818
Something I said?

119
00:08:49,585 --> 00:08:52,573
- Paul, what's going on?
- Leah's had another vision.

120
00:08:57,642 --> 00:08:59,092
Wanna go to church?

121
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:00,891
You know me.

122
00:09:01,382 --> 00:09:02,682
Downright pious.

123
00:09:04,517 --> 00:09:06,086
3 miles off Talmadge road.

124
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:09,739
5 miles.

125
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:13,829
There are demons gathered.
I don't know how many, but a lot.

126
00:09:15,609 --> 00:09:16,805
Who's gonna join me?

127
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:19,628
Wouldn't miss it.

128
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:23,312
Someone's got to cover Rob's ass.

129
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:25,827
We're in, padre.

130
00:09:28,071 --> 00:09:29,921
I'd like to offer a prayer.

131
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:34,766
Our Father in heaven...

132
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:35,949
Not so much.

133
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:38,391
Help us to fight in Your name.

134
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,664
We ask that You protect us
from all servants of evil.

135
00:09:43,219 --> 00:09:45,419
Guide our hands in defeating them.

136
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,519
Deliver us *

137
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:50,721
Thank you. Amen.

138
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:45,688
I guess that's what it's like.

139
00:11:45,813 --> 00:11:46,813
What?

140
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:48,739
Having backup.

141
00:11:56,391 --> 00:11:58,800
Is that cool if I get a ride
back with you guys?

142
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,349
You saved my ass twice.
One more time, you can drive.

143
00:12:05,936 --> 00:12:06,986
Get a beer.

144
00:12:14,076 --> 00:12:17,776
- You earned it. Don't tell your mom.
- Believe me, I will not.

145
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,393


146
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,149
Ma'am, we're just very sorry.

147
00:13:05,805 --> 00:13:06,855
You know...

148
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,740
This is your fault.

149
00:13:29,352 --> 00:13:30,939
I wish I knew what to say.

150
00:13:32,282 --> 00:13:33,382
But I don't.

151
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:36,690
I'm so sorry, Jane.

152
00:13:39,172 --> 00:13:40,172
Rob.

153
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:42,320
There are no words.

154
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,870
Dylan...

155
00:13:46,155 --> 00:13:48,118
I don't know why this happened.

156
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:52,164
I don't know why any of this
is happening.

157
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,640
I got no easy answers.

158
00:13:58,244 --> 00:13:59,744
What I do know is...

159
00:14:00,616 --> 00:14:01,716
Leah, honey?

160
00:14:07,534 --> 00:14:09,181
It's okay, sweetie, it's okay.

161
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,854
- Dad, it's Dylan.
- Just rest a minute,

162
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:17,189
No, listen.

163
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:20,039
Dylan's coming back.

164
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:27,949
Jane, Rob...

165
00:14:29,005 --> 00:14:31,244
It's going to be okay.
You'll see Dylan again.

166
00:14:33,685 --> 00:14:35,279
When the final day comes,

167
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:36,438
judgment day,

168
00:14:36,563 --> 00:14:38,835
he'll be resurrected,
and you'll be together again.

169
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:42,005
We'll all be together.
With all our loved ones.

170
00:14:43,018 --> 00:14:44,418
We've been chosen.

171
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,676
The angels have chosen us.

172
00:14:47,028 --> 00:14:49,054
And we will be given
paradise on earth.

173
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:51,428
All we have to do

174
00:14:51,906 --> 00:14:53,558
is follow the angels' commandments.

175
00:15:00,329 --> 00:15:03,079
No drinking, no gambling,
no premarital sex?

176
00:15:03,872 --> 00:15:06,393
They basically just outlawed
90% of your personality.

177
00:15:06,518 --> 00:15:08,568
Well, whatever. When in Rome...

178
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,010
- You're cool with it?
- I'm not cool.

179
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:14,585
I'm not not cool...

180
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:18,931
Look, man, I'm not a prophet.
We're not locals. It's not my call.

181
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:24,729
I'll catch up with you.

182
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:34,423
Bad time?

183
00:15:36,548 --> 00:15:37,598
In general.

184
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:39,618
But now's okay.

185
00:15:45,608 --> 00:15:47,320
Angel stuff
really takes it out of you?

186
00:15:48,676 --> 00:15:49,926
Can't complain.

187
00:15:50,236 --> 00:15:51,986
I know you have it worse.

188
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:56,913
So, what's on your mind, Dean?

189
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:03,835
Don't take this the wrong way,
but...

190
00:16:05,096 --> 00:16:06,339
Are you on the level?

191
00:16:07,205 --> 00:16:08,255
About what?

192
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:12,804
About paradise.

193
00:16:14,176 --> 00:16:15,376
What about it?

194
00:16:18,004 --> 00:16:19,936
I wanna know
what the angels are telling you.

195
00:16:20,883 --> 00:16:21,933
Everything.

196
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:23,278
Well...

197
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,317
And you can skip the rainbows.

198
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:27,944
There's gonna be a prizefight,

199
00:16:28,531 --> 00:16:29,531
and...

200
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,106
It's gonna get bad.

201
00:16:33,689 --> 00:16:35,039
But after we win,

202
00:16:35,574 --> 00:16:36,734
and we will,

203
00:16:37,405 --> 00:16:39,331
The planet gets handed over
to the chosen,

204
00:16:40,247 --> 00:16:41,247
and...

205
00:16:41,516 --> 00:16:43,116
It's finally peaceful.

206
00:16:43,843 --> 00:16:45,643
No monsters,

207
00:16:45,768 --> 00:16:47,744
no disease, no death.

208
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:50,165
You're just...

209
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:54,516
With the people you love.

210
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:01,017
If you can get past the velvet rope.

211
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:03,805
Must be nice.

212
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:05,815
Being chosen.

213
00:17:07,184 --> 00:17:09,486
Well, Dean, you're chosen.

214
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:14,833
More like cursed.

215
00:17:17,198 --> 00:17:18,348
Must be hard.

216
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,830
Being the vessel of heaven
and having no hope.

217
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,770
So, what happened to,
"the apocalypse is good for business"?

218
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:47,238
Right up until Leah's angel pals
banned the good stuff.

219
00:17:47,887 --> 00:17:50,337
- Help me kill some inventory?
- Sure.

220
00:17:50,462 --> 00:17:51,777
Don't get me wrong.

221
00:17:51,902 --> 00:17:54,030
I grew up here. I love this town.

222
00:17:55,593 --> 00:17:57,143
These holy rollers...

223
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:01,704
I noticed
you're not the praying type.

224
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:04,576
Between you and me,
neither are half those guys.

225
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:08,461
Couple of months back, they were here,
getting wasted, banging the nanny.

226
00:18:08,757 --> 00:18:10,857
Now they're all warriors of God.

227
00:18:10,982 --> 00:18:12,482
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

228
00:18:20,277 --> 00:18:22,177
There's sure as hell demons.

229
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:25,385
And maybe there is a God.
I don't know. Fine.

230
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,210
But I'm not a hypocrite.

231
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:31,276
I never prayed before, I ain't starting.
If I go to hell, I'm going honest.

232
00:18:32,261 --> 00:18:33,461
How about you?

233
00:18:34,675 --> 00:18:37,258
- What about me?
- Not a true believer, I take it?

234
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:40,401
I believe.

235
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:42,604
I do. I'm just...

236
00:18:43,803 --> 00:18:46,703
Pretty sure God stopped caring
a long time ago.

237
00:18:55,261 --> 00:18:56,511
Where you been?

238
00:18:57,731 --> 00:18:58,731
Drinkin'.

239
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,970
- You rebel.
- I'd have had more...

240
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:05,177
But it was curfew.

241
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:08,449
You hear they shut down
the cell towers?

242
00:19:10,736 --> 00:19:12,136
That's news to me.

243
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,360
No cable, Internet.

244
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:18,406
Total cutoff from the "corruption
of the outside world."

245
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:23,783
Don't you get it?

246
00:19:24,102 --> 00:19:26,956
They're turning this place into
some kind of fundamentalist compound.

247
00:19:27,726 --> 00:19:30,043
- No, I get it.
- And all you got's a "hmm"?

248
00:19:30,607 --> 00:19:33,129
- What's wrong?
- I get it. I just don't care.

249
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,340
What?

250
00:19:35,998 --> 00:19:39,052
- What difference does it make?
- It makes a hell of a...

251
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,808
At what point does this become
too far for you?

252
00:19:45,593 --> 00:19:47,443
Stoning? Poisoned kool-aid?

253
00:19:48,352 --> 00:19:50,807
The angels are toying
with these people.

254
00:19:50,932 --> 00:19:53,733
- Angel world, angel rules.
- Since when is that okay with you?

255
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,265
Since the angels got the only
lifeboats on the Titanic.

256
00:19:57,632 --> 00:20:00,198
Who is supposed to come along
and save these people?

257
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,966
It was supposed to be us.
We can't do it.

258
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:07,539
So, what, you want to just
stop fighting, roll over?

259
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:09,467
I don't know. Maybe.

260
00:20:13,385 --> 00:20:15,046
- Don't say that.
- Why not?

261
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,966
- Cause you can't do this.
- Actually, I can.

262
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,584
No, you can't.
You can't do this tome.

263
00:20:26,229 --> 00:20:28,979
I got one thing.
One thing keeping me going.

264
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:31,938
You think you're the only one
white-knuckling it here?

265
00:20:32,477 --> 00:20:34,427
I can't count on anyone else.

266
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:38,011
And I can't do this alone.

1
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,353
I got to clear my head.

2
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:48,746
It's past curfew.

3
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,189
It's past curfew.

4
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,369
Leah, what's wrong?

5
00:20:59,611 --> 00:21:01,342
Daddy, can I talk to you
for a second?

6
00:21:01,467 --> 00:21:02,467
Of course.

7
00:21:05,606 --> 00:21:09,183
- Leah, honey, what is it?
- I'm sorry. They're just so angry.

8
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,102
- Who is?
- The angels.

9
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,704
- Why are they angry?
- They said...

10
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:17,775
They said that
we can't go to paradise.

11
00:21:18,518 --> 00:21:19,518
What?

12
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:24,406
- We're doing everything they say!
- They gave clear commandments.

13
00:21:24,531 --> 00:21:26,326
But some people aren't listening.

14
00:21:27,143 --> 00:21:28,143
Who, Leah?

15
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:44,248
I got your message.

16
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,590
It was long, your message.

17
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,108
And I find the sound of your voice
grating.

18
00:21:53,577 --> 00:21:54,727
What's wrong?

19
00:21:56,112 --> 00:21:57,112
Are you...

20
00:21:58,407 --> 00:21:59,407
Drunk?

21
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,001
What happened to you?

22
00:22:09,945 --> 00:22:12,095
- I found a liquor store.
- And?

23
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:13,423
I drank it.

24
00:22:14,134 --> 00:22:15,345
Why'd you call me?

25
00:22:15,948 --> 00:22:17,398
There you go. Easy.

26
00:22:18,423 --> 00:22:19,573
Are you okay?

27
00:22:24,435 --> 00:22:25,843
Don't ask stupid questions.

28
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,827
Tell me what you need.

29
00:22:29,952 --> 00:22:32,100
There have been these demon attacks,

30
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,852
massive, on the edge of town,
and we can't figure out why...

31
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,021
- Any sign of angels?
- Sort of.

32
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,414
They've been speaking
to this prophet.

33
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:41,484
- Who?
- This girl, Leah Gideon.

34
00:22:42,081 --> 00:22:43,945
- She's not a prophet.
- Pretty sure she is.

35
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:46,698
Visions, headaches...
The whole package.

36
00:22:46,996 --> 00:22:49,396
The names of all the prophets,

37
00:22:49,974 --> 00:22:51,924
they're seared into my brain.

38
00:22:52,724 --> 00:22:54,706
Leah Gideon is not one of them.

39
00:22:57,033 --> 00:22:58,383
Then what is she?

40
00:23:16,401 --> 00:23:17,601
Take a breath!

41
00:23:17,726 --> 00:23:19,694
You come on my property,
spouting some...

42
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:21,736
Sorry, Paul! There's no other way!

43
00:23:21,861 --> 00:23:23,411
What country is this?

44
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,843
- Need a hand, padre?
- Everybody cool down for a minute!

45
00:23:27,968 --> 00:23:30,215
My friends
are trying to run me out of town.

46
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,452
- I should cool down?
- It is not our choice.

47
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:34,537
- Come on, that's bull.
- Go!

48
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,539
- For everyone's sake!
- We grew up together.

49
00:23:37,212 --> 00:23:39,667
- I stood up at your wedding!
- You did, but that was then.

50
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:43,171
- Now you're standing against the flock.
- That's not true. I fight with you.

51
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,239
This is a town of believers.

52
00:23:45,516 --> 00:23:48,501
- You are not a believer.
- Don't make this hard for us.

53
00:23:50,749 --> 00:23:51,899
Hard for you?

54
00:23:57,843 --> 00:23:59,143
This is my home.

55
00:23:59,345 --> 00:24:01,045
You want me out of here?

56
00:24:01,618 --> 00:24:02,718
Drag me out.

57
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,820
You don't wanna do this.

58
00:24:15,547 --> 00:24:17,663
No one's gonna stop me
from seeing my son again.

59
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:31,636


60
00:24:33,242 --> 00:24:35,042
We went out looking for...

61
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:37,349
You all right?

62
00:24:40,908 --> 00:24:42,308
It's not my blood.

63
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:44,982
- Paul's dead.
- What?

64
00:24:45,506 --> 00:24:47,443
- Jane shot him.
- It's starting.

65
00:24:48,524 --> 00:24:50,279
What's starting?
Where have you been?

66
00:24:50,801 --> 00:24:51,901
On a bender.

67
00:24:53,151 --> 00:24:56,160
- Did you say on a bender?
- He's still pretty smashed.

68
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,787
It is not of import.

69
00:24:58,649 --> 00:25:00,661
We need to talk
about what's happening here.

70
00:25:01,288 --> 00:25:02,438
I'm all ears.

71
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:04,127
For starters...

72
00:25:05,165 --> 00:25:07,015
Leah is not a real prophet.

73
00:25:08,337 --> 00:25:10,383
- What is she, exactly?
- The whore.

74
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:13,475
Cass, tell us what you really think.

75
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,100
She rises
when Lucifer walks the earth.

76
00:25:16,628 --> 00:25:19,428
"And she shall come,
bearing false prophecy."

77
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:22,748
This creature has the power

78
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:25,523
to take a human's form, read minds.

79
00:25:25,777 --> 00:25:27,900
Book of revelation calls her
"the whore of Babylon."

80
00:25:28,608 --> 00:25:29,619
That's catchy.

81
00:25:29,744 --> 00:25:31,571
Leah was probably killed months ago.

82
00:25:31,945 --> 00:25:34,532
- What about the demons?
- They're under her control.

83
00:25:34,857 --> 00:25:36,826
- And the enochian exorcism?
- Fake.

84
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:39,138
It actually means

85
00:25:39,308 --> 00:25:41,708
"you breed
with the mouth of a goat."

86
00:25:48,251 --> 00:25:49,547
It's funnier in enochian.

87
00:25:49,935 --> 00:25:52,354
The demons smoking out,
that's just a con?

88
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:55,229
- Why? What's the endgame?
- What you just saw.

89
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:58,139
- Innocent blood spilt in God's name.
- You heard that heaven talk.

90
00:25:58,564 --> 00:26:00,214
She manipulates people.

91
00:26:00,378 --> 00:26:03,186
To slaughter and kill
and sing peppy little hymns.

92
00:26:05,116 --> 00:26:06,116
Awesome.

93
00:26:06,241 --> 00:26:08,900
Her goal is to condemn
as many souls to hell as possible.

94
00:26:09,978 --> 00:26:11,678
And it's just beginning.

95
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,531
She's well on her way to dragging
this whole town into the pit.

96
00:26:16,462 --> 00:26:17,462
All right.

97
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:21,704
So, then, how do we go
pimp of Babylon all over this bitch?

98
00:26:24,661 --> 00:26:26,111
I only wanted to...

99
00:26:27,748 --> 00:26:29,248
Did I make it worse?

100
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,518
Did I make the angels angry?

101
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:33,674
The angels...

102
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:35,478
They understand.

103
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,431
What you did
was for the greater good.

104
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:43,918
We all liked Paul.

105
00:26:45,141 --> 00:26:46,379
But he was a sinner,

106
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,147
and would have
taken us down with him.

107
00:26:49,987 --> 00:26:51,937
- You saved us.
- Thank you.

108
00:26:53,218 --> 00:26:54,768
How can that be okay?

109
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:56,571
She killed him.

110
00:26:56,956 --> 00:26:59,809
- That sin is so much greater...
- It's not a sin to strike down evil.

111
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:02,128
- How can the angels...
- You always taught me

112
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:03,663
we have to have faith.

113
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:09,733
The whore can be killed with that.

114
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,631
It's a stake
made from a cypress tree in Babylon.

115
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,593
- Great. Let's ventilate her.
- It's not that easy.

116
00:27:18,773 --> 00:27:19,773
Course not.

117
00:27:19,898 --> 00:27:22,804
The whore can only be killed
by a true servant of heaven.

118
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:24,684
- Servant, like...
- Not you.

119
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:27,452
Or me.
Sam, of course, is an abomination.

120
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,560
We'll have to find someone else.

121
00:27:31,896 --> 00:27:32,900
The angels...

122
00:27:33,356 --> 00:27:34,860
I don't know why they've chosen us.

123
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:36,195
But they have.

124
00:27:37,776 --> 00:27:38,781
And today...

125
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,158
They told me
the most important thing yet.

126
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,781
Tonight, at midnight...

127
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:50,584
I'm sorry.

128
00:27:51,457 --> 00:27:53,796
It's just that we knew
this day would come,

129
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,516
and it's here.

130
00:27:57,695 --> 00:27:59,145
The final judgment.

131
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:03,639
Now, we need to do this right.
We don't have much time.

132
00:28:04,037 --> 00:28:05,141
We're not ready.

133
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,584
There are still a few elements
that need to be taken care of.

134
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,188
Sinners.

135
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,698
Everybody calm down.

136
00:28:23,823 --> 00:28:24,823
Hold on.

137
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:29,013
- You're scaring these people.
- I don't want us to panic.

138
00:28:29,138 --> 00:28:30,861
- But we have to hurry.
- Stop it.

139
00:28:30,986 --> 00:28:32,877
I've been given instructions, names.

140
00:28:34,782 --> 00:28:36,255
What are you doing? Stop it!

141
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,373
- You're gonna get somebody killed.
- Let me go.

142
00:28:39,945 --> 00:28:41,802
Or the next sinner I name
will be you.

143
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,561


144
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:08,833
Pastor David Gideon?

145
00:29:09,513 --> 00:29:10,613
Who are you?

146
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:14,001
- I'm an angel of the Lord.
- Yeah, sure.

147
00:29:21,992 --> 00:29:23,192
What was that?

148
00:29:23,449 --> 00:29:25,816
He wasn't lying
about the angel thing.

149
00:29:25,941 --> 00:29:27,989
Have a seat, padre.
We got to have a chat.

150
00:29:34,457 --> 00:29:36,524
- She's my daughter.
- I'm sorry, but she's not.

151
00:29:37,077 --> 00:29:39,440
- She killed your daughter.
- That's impossible.

152
00:29:39,565 --> 00:29:41,779
But it's true.
And deep down, you know it.

153
00:29:43,641 --> 00:29:45,393
Look, we get it. It's too much.

154
00:29:45,518 --> 00:29:48,619
But if you don't do this,
she's going to kill a lot of people

155
00:29:49,222 --> 00:29:51,022
and damn the rest to hell.

156
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,794
Why does it have to be me?

157
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:58,564
You're a servant of heaven.

158
00:29:58,689 --> 00:30:01,006
- And you're an angel.
- Poor example of one.

159
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:21,001
Heads up.

160
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:27,819
- How many should I take?
- You?

161
00:30:28,814 --> 00:30:30,414
Down the whole bottle.

162
00:30:34,218 --> 00:30:35,499
Don't mention it.

163
00:30:36,276 --> 00:30:37,576
I've been there.

164
00:30:38,856 --> 00:30:41,406
I'm a big expert on deadbeat dads,
so...

165
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,390
I get it.

166
00:30:45,378 --> 00:30:46,878
I know how you feel.

167
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:52,398
How do you manage it?

168
00:30:57,217 --> 00:30:59,023
On a good day,
you get to kill a whore.

169
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:08,115
Rob, Jane, please!
Come on, it's me! It's Elise!

170
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,118
Sorry. Really.
But you know we have to do this.

171
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:14,288
We're putting them
in the storage unit.

172
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,256
Jane, is that everyone?

173
00:31:32,749 --> 00:31:34,099
Get the kerosene.

174
00:31:39,693 --> 00:31:40,693
What?

175
00:31:41,882 --> 00:31:43,582
There are kids in there.

176
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,930
The angels named them for a reason.

177
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,190
Your son needs you to do this.

178
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,984
- Daddy! Don't hurt me!
- Gideon, now!

179
00:32:25,646 --> 00:32:26,896
Pizin noco iad.

180
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:36,579
Wait! No!

181
00:32:40,273 --> 00:32:41,873
Help me! He's a demon!

182
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:50,469
Light the kerosene.

183
00:33:18,507 --> 00:33:20,331
Please.
Like you're a servant of heaven.

184
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,790
Let me go!

185
00:33:22,475 --> 00:33:25,461
This is why my team's gonna win.
You're the great vessel?

186
00:33:25,845 --> 00:33:28,595
You're pathetic,
self-hating, and faithless.

187
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:30,883
It's the end of the world.

188
00:33:31,346 --> 00:33:33,427
And you're just gonna sit back
and watch it happen.

189
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,934
Don't be so sure, whore.

190
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,390
I don't understand.

191
00:34:18,103 --> 00:34:20,099
How are we supposed
to get to paradise now?

192
00:34:22,387 --> 00:34:23,387
I'm sorry.

193
00:34:24,285 --> 00:34:26,397
Pretty sure you're headed
in a different direction.

194
00:34:30,255 --> 00:34:31,255
Gotcha.

195
00:34:47,005 --> 00:34:49,055
- How did you do that?
- What?

196
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:52,261
- Kill her.
- Long run of luck held out, I guess.

197
00:34:53,419 --> 00:34:56,567
Last I checked, she could only be ganked
by a servant of heaven.

198
00:34:56,692 --> 00:34:59,920
What do you want me to tell you?
I saw a shot, I went for it.

199
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,903
- Are you gonna do something stupid?
- Like what?

200
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:12,443
Like Michael stupid.

201
00:35:13,302 --> 00:35:15,112
Come on, Sam. Give me a break.

202
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:27,249
- How's the head?
- I'm seeing double.

203
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:29,918
But that may be the painkillers.

204
00:35:30,724 --> 00:35:31,974
You'll be okay.

205
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,012
Where you going?

206
00:35:47,137 --> 00:35:49,313
Grab some clean bandages
out of the trunk. Relax.

207
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,195
Damn it! Dean!

208
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:19,677


209
00:36:59,057 --> 00:37:00,057
Hi, Lisa.

210
00:37:02,876 --> 00:37:04,429
I didn't have your number, so...

211
00:37:05,415 --> 00:37:06,765
It's okay, I'm...

212
00:37:07,954 --> 00:37:09,404
I'm just surprised.

213
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,966
- How's Ben?
- Good.

214
00:37:15,373 --> 00:37:17,023
Good. He's at baseball.

215
00:37:19,147 --> 00:37:20,647
You moved. It's a...

216
00:37:21,834 --> 00:37:22,865
Nice house.

217
00:37:24,374 --> 00:37:26,493
You didn't come here
to talk about real estate.

218
00:37:28,595 --> 00:37:29,795
You all right?

219
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:33,709
Not really.

220
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:37,546
What is it?

221
00:37:42,514 --> 00:37:44,314
Look, I have no illusions.

222
00:37:45,562 --> 00:37:47,462
I know the life that I live.

223
00:37:48,929 --> 00:37:50,976
I know how that's gonna end for me.

224
00:37:51,847 --> 00:37:53,797
Whatever, I'm okay with that.

225
00:37:55,332 --> 00:37:56,690
But I wanted you to know...

226
00:37:58,447 --> 00:38:00,597
When I do picture myself happy...

227
00:38:03,818 --> 00:38:05,018
It's with you.

228
00:38:07,093 --> 00:38:08,193
And the kid.

229
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:19,085
- You don't have to say anything.
- I mean, I know. I know.

230
00:38:20,335 --> 00:38:21,335
I want to.

231
00:38:23,908 --> 00:38:26,238
- Come inside, let me get you a beer.
- I wish I could.

232
00:38:34,028 --> 00:38:35,928
Take care of yourself, Lisa.

233
00:38:37,701 --> 00:38:40,170
You can't just drop a bombshell
like that and then leave.

234
00:38:42,409 --> 00:38:44,153
I know. I'm sorry.

235
00:38:46,778 --> 00:38:48,982
- But I don't have a choice.
- You do.

236
00:38:49,107 --> 00:38:52,216
You can come inside
and let me get you a beer.

237
00:38:52,356 --> 00:38:53,556
Wait a minute.

238
00:38:56,608 --> 00:38:58,858
Things are about to get really bad.

239
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:00,336
Like how?

240
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:05,030
- Like your kind of bad?
- Worse.

241
00:39:05,295 --> 00:39:08,146
Next few days,
it's gonna be downright trippy.

242
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:09,638
Scary.

243
00:39:10,103 --> 00:39:13,435
But don't worry, because
I'm making arrangements for you and Ben.

244
00:39:14,515 --> 00:39:16,520
- Arrangements?
- You're gonna be okay.

245
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:17,967
What do you mean?

246
00:39:18,092 --> 00:39:20,372
The people I'm gonna see
won't get anything from me

247
00:39:20,497 --> 00:39:22,507
without agreeing
to a few conditions.

248
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,612
Just come inside. Please.

249
00:39:25,899 --> 00:39:27,948
And whatever you're thinking of doing,
don't.

250
00:39:30,009 --> 00:39:31,009
I have to.

251
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:32,896
Just stay an hour.

252
00:39:34,217 --> 00:39:35,917
At least say bye to Ben.

253
00:39:40,799 --> 00:39:42,449
It's better if I don't.

254
00:40:00,371 --> 00:40:01,371
Bye, Lisa.
