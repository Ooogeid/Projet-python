1
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:05,258
There's a big new up incomer.
Her name is Lilith.

2
00:00:05,418 --> 00:00:06,885
I don't think I like you anymore.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,389
I've got demon blood in me, Dean.

4
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:13,099
I'm a whole new level of freak.

5
00:00:15,428 --> 00:00:17,187
Wait, it's not Ruby, it's Lilith.

6
00:00:17,806 --> 00:00:18,953
Sic him, boy!

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,859
You should show me some respect.

8
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:25,612
I dragged you out of hell.

9
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:29,949
I can throw you back in.

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,566
Run!

11
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:05,312
It'll kill you!

12
00:01:20,702 --> 00:01:23,125
Synchro : IceFre@k

13
00:01:36,526 --> 00:01:39,227
Agent tyler,
agent perry, meet frank o'brien.

14
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:41,510
He died of a heart attack, right?

15
00:01:41,857 --> 00:01:42,948
Three days ago.

16
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,942
But o'brien was 44 years old

17
00:01:46,102 --> 00:01:48,778
and according to this,
a marathon runner.

18
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:51,641
Everybody drops dead sooner or later.
It's why I got job security.

19
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:53,456
Yeah, but frank kicked it here.

20
00:01:53,576 --> 00:01:56,828
Now, just yesterday, two perfectly
healthy men bit it in maumee.

21
00:01:56,988 --> 00:01:59,080
All heart attacks.
You don't think that's strange?

22
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,150
Sounds like maumee's problem to me.
Why's the fbi give a damn, anyway?

23
00:02:02,508 --> 00:02:04,711
We just want to see the
results of frank's autopsy.

24
00:02:06,187 --> 00:02:07,202
What autopsy?

25
00:02:08,805 --> 00:02:10,175
The one you're gonna do.

26
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:18,455
First dead body?

27
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,767
Far from it.

28
00:02:19,887 --> 00:02:20,977
Oh, good.

29
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:23,741
Because these suckers
can get pretty ripe.

30
00:02:24,326 --> 00:02:26,240
Hey, hand me those rib cutters,
would you?

31
00:02:38,646 --> 00:02:40,380
Is that from a wedding ring?

32
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,462
- I didn't think Frank was married.
- Ain't my department.

33
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:48,213
- Any idea how he got these?
- You know what?

34
00:02:48,373 --> 00:02:51,069
When you drop dead,
you actually tend to drop.

35
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,593
Body probably got scraped
up when it hit the ground.

36
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:56,221
What?

37
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:59,974
I-I can't find any blockages
in any of the major arteries.

38
00:03:06,512 --> 00:03:08,233
Heart looks pretty damn healthy.

39
00:03:08,793 --> 00:03:10,617
Hold that a second, would you?

40
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,576
Oh, sorry.

41
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:18,701
Spleen juice.

42
00:03:31,722 --> 00:03:33,988
Hell's bells,
linus, have you seen my --

43
00:03:36,194 --> 00:03:37,147
Who are they?

44
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:38,751
Federal agents.
I, uh --

45
00:03:38,871 --> 00:03:40,271
And you kept them waiting?

46
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:42,209
You -- you said not to disturb.

47
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,560
Come on back, fellas.

48
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:50,817
Shoes off.

49
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:08,998
Al britton.

50
00:04:09,495 --> 00:04:11,061
- Good to meet you.
- You too.

51
00:04:12,746 --> 00:04:13,750
Thank you.

52
00:04:15,186 --> 00:04:16,189
Okay.

53
00:04:26,938 --> 00:04:27,999
So...

54
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:30,773
What can I do for uncle sam?

55
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:33,731
Well, we're looking into
the death of frank o'brien.

56
00:04:35,063 --> 00:04:37,431
We understand some
of your men found his body.

57
00:04:37,688 --> 00:04:38,688
They did.

58
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:41,437
Me and frank --

59
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,787
We were friends.

60
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:47,415
Hell, we were gamecocks.

61
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:52,277
That's our softball team's name.

62
00:04:54,815 --> 00:04:56,633
They're majestic animals.

63
00:05:01,628 --> 00:05:03,348
I knew frank since high school.

64
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,224
To be honest,

65
00:05:05,384 --> 00:05:08,253
I just this morning got up
the strength to go see him.

66
00:05:08,977 --> 00:05:10,126
Frank was...

67
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,315
He was a good man.

68
00:05:12,755 --> 00:05:13,817
Yeah.

69
00:05:13,937 --> 00:05:14,817
Big heart.

70
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:20,470
Before he died,
did you notice frank acting strange?

71
00:05:20,698 --> 00:05:22,986
- Maybe scared of something?
- Oh, hell, yeah.

72
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:24,911
Real jumpy.

73
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:27,064
- You know what scared him?
- No.

74
00:05:27,835 --> 00:05:29,318
Wouldn't answer his phone.

75
00:05:29,438 --> 00:05:32,627
Finally, I sent some of my boys
over to check on him, and,

76
00:05:34,004 --> 00:05:35,421
you know the rest.

77
00:05:48,803 --> 00:05:50,457
So, why the feds give a crap?

78
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:52,820
You don't really think
there's a case here?

79
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,757
No, no.

80
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:55,233
It's probably nothing.

81
00:05:56,004 --> 00:05:57,162
Just a heart attack.

82
00:05:58,184 --> 00:05:59,572
No way that was a heart attack.

83
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,822
Definitely no way.

84
00:06:00,942 --> 00:06:03,232
Three victims,
all with those same red scratches,

85
00:06:03,352 --> 00:06:06,008
all went from jittery to terrified
to dead within 48 hours.

86
00:06:06,128 --> 00:06:07,853
Something scared them to death?

87
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:10,133
All right, so, what can do that?

88
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:11,253
What can't?

89
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:13,257
Ghosts, vampires, chupacabra?

90
00:06:13,377 --> 00:06:14,849
It could be a hundred things.

91
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:17,132
So we make a list and
start crossing things off.

92
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,600
All right, who's the last
person to see frank o'brien alive?

93
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,697
His neighbor, Mark Hutchins.

94
00:06:21,817 --> 00:06:23,753
- Hang on, hey.
- What?

95
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:28,349
I don't like the looks
of those teenagers down there.

96
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:33,296
Let's walk this way.

97
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:45,241
Tyler and perry.

98
00:06:45,684 --> 00:06:46,804
Just like aerosmith.

99
00:06:46,986 --> 00:06:48,054
Yeah, small world.

100
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,580
So, the last time
you saw frank o'brien?

101
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,390
Monday. He was watching
me from his window.

102
00:06:53,856 --> 00:06:55,835
I waved at him,
but he just closed the curtains.

103
00:06:57,228 --> 00:06:59,630
Did you speak to him recently?
Did he seem different?

104
00:07:00,956 --> 00:07:01,885
Uh, scared?

105
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,634
Oh, totally.
He was freaking out.

106
00:07:12,695 --> 00:07:14,135
Do you know, uh --

107
00:07:14,255 --> 00:07:16,439
- Do you know what scared him?
- Well, yeah, witches.

108
00:07:16,872 --> 00:07:17,857
Witches?

109
00:07:19,462 --> 00:07:20,485
Like...?

110
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:22,862
"Wizard of oz" was
on tv the other night, right?

111
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:25,281
And he said that green
bitch was totally out to get him.

112
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:31,746
- Anything else scare him?
- Everything else scared him...

113
00:07:32,049 --> 00:07:34,040
Al-qaeda, ferrets,

114
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,698
artificial sweetener,

115
00:07:35,976 --> 00:07:38,628
those pez dispensers
with their dead little eyes --

116
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:40,275
- Lots of stuff.
- So, tell me --

117
00:07:40,395 --> 00:07:41,664
What was frank like?

118
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,010
I mean, he's dead, you know?

119
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,887
I don't want to hammer him,

120
00:07:48,198 --> 00:07:49,636
but he got better.

121
00:07:50,032 --> 00:07:51,302
He got better?

122
00:07:52,075 --> 00:07:54,185
Well, in high school
he was -- he was a dick.

123
00:07:54,345 --> 00:07:55,228
A dick?

124
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:56,439
Like a bully.

125
00:07:56,746 --> 00:07:59,565
I mean, he probably taped half
the town's butt cheeks together,

126
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:01,984
mine included.

127
00:08:03,957 --> 00:08:05,901
So he pissed a lot of people off.

128
00:08:06,148 --> 00:08:08,491
You think anyone would
have wanted to get revenge?

129
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,256
Well, I don't...

130
00:08:11,503 --> 00:08:14,372
- Frank had a heart attack, right?
- Just answer the question, sir.

131
00:08:15,227 --> 00:08:17,002
I don't think so.

132
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:19,461
Like I said, he got better

133
00:08:19,828 --> 00:08:22,131
- after what happened to his wife.
- His wife?

134
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:24,257
So he was married.

135
00:08:25,044 --> 00:08:27,166
She died about 20 years ago.

136
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,096
Frank was really broken up about it.

137
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:39,276
Don't be scared of donny.
He's a sweetheart.

138
00:08:40,298 --> 00:08:42,233
It's marie you got to look out for.

139
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:43,901
She smells fear.

140
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:08,503
Any luck at the
county clerk's office?

141
00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:10,263
I'm not sure i'd call it luck.

142
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,390
Frank's wife,
jessie, was a manic-depressive.

143
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,474
She went off her meds
back in'88 and vanished.

144
00:09:16,071 --> 00:09:18,769
They found her two weeks later,
three towns over,

145
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:21,258
strung up in her motel room...
Suicide.

146
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:23,575
Any chance frank helped
her along to the other side?

147
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:26,277
No, frank was working the
swing shift when she disappeared.

148
00:09:27,158 --> 00:09:28,497
Airtight alibi.

149
00:09:32,513 --> 00:09:33,812
How was frank's pad?

150
00:09:34,545 --> 00:09:35,388
Clean.

151
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,539
Searched it top to bottom.
No emf, no hex bags, no silver.

152
00:09:38,699 --> 00:09:40,833
So probably no ghosts,
no witches, no demons.

153
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,587
- 3 down and 97 to go.
- Yeah.

154
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,549
Dude, you're going 20.

155
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:50,051
And?

156
00:09:50,211 --> 00:09:51,545
That's the speed limit.

157
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:53,721
What?
Safety's a crime now?

158
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,415
Dude, where are you going?
That was our hotel.

159
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,745
I'm not gonna make a
left-hand turn into oncoming traffic.

160
00:10:03,865 --> 00:10:05,055
I'm not suicidal.

161
00:10:06,821 --> 00:10:09,036
Did I just say that?
That was kind of weird.

162
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,806
Do you hear something?

163
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:25,313
Am I haunted?

164
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:27,535
Am I haunted?!

165
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,354
Yeah, how about it.
Keep looking.

166
00:10:58,794 --> 00:10:59,821
Dude.

167
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:01,650
Look at this.

168
00:11:03,316 --> 00:11:04,825
- I just talked to bobby.
- And?

169
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:07,134
Um, well, you're not gonna like it.

170
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,830
What?

171
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:12,425
It's ghost sickness.

172
00:11:13,323 --> 00:11:14,890
- Ghost sickness?
- Yeah.

173
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,010
God, no.

174
00:11:16,228 --> 00:11:17,228
Yeah.

175
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,321
I don't even know what that is.

176
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:21,323
Some cultures believe
that certain spirits

177
00:11:21,443 --> 00:11:23,811
can infect the living with a disease,
which is why they stopped

178
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:26,602
displaying bodies in houses and started
taking them off to funeral homes.

179
00:11:26,722 --> 00:11:29,266
- Okay, get to the good stuff.
- Symptoms are you get anxious...

180
00:11:29,915 --> 00:11:33,321
... and scared, then really scared,
then your heart gives out.

181
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,439
Sound familiar?

182
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,511
Yeah, but,
sam, we haven't seen a ghost in weeks.

183
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:39,158
I doubt you caught it from a ghost.

184
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:41,204
Look, once a spirit infects
that first person,

185
00:11:41,324 --> 00:11:43,118
ghost sickness can spread like
any sickness

186
00:11:43,238 --> 00:11:44,889
through a cough,
a handshake, whatever.

187
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:46,100
It's like the flu.

188
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,102
Now, frank o'brien
was the first to die,

189
00:11:48,222 --> 00:11:50,267
which means he was probably
the first infected.

190
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:51,297
Patient zero.

191
00:11:52,377 --> 00:11:54,141
Our very own outbreak monkey.

192
00:11:54,261 --> 00:11:55,293
Right. Get this...

193
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:57,377
Frank was in Maumee
over the weekend.

194
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,932
Softball tournament...

195
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:02,215
Which is where he must have
infected the other two victims.

196
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:03,713
Were they gamecocks?

197
00:12:04,178 --> 00:12:05,310
Cornjerkers.

198
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,610
So, ghosts infected frank,

199
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,107
he passed it on to the other guys,
and I got it from his corpse?

200
00:12:10,357 --> 00:12:11,233
Right.

201
00:12:11,588 --> 00:12:14,494
So now, what, I have 48 hours
before I go insane and my heart stops?

202
00:12:15,323 --> 00:12:16,655
More like 24.

203
00:12:16,815 --> 00:12:17,935
- Super.
- Yeah.

204
00:12:18,719 --> 00:12:20,016
Well, why me?
Why not you?

205
00:12:20,136 --> 00:12:21,624
You got hit with the spleen juice.

206
00:12:21,744 --> 00:12:24,953
Yeah, um, you see, bobby
and I have a theory about that, too.

207
00:12:25,073 --> 00:12:27,684
Turns out all three victims
shared a certain,

208
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:29,578
personality type.

209
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:31,500
Frank was a bully.
The other two victims --

210
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,228
One was a vice principal,
the other was a bouncer.

211
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:35,392
Okay.

212
00:12:35,512 --> 00:12:37,303
Basically, they were all dicks.

213
00:12:37,748 --> 00:12:39,345
- So you're saying i'm a dick?
- No.

214
00:12:39,505 --> 00:12:42,473
It's not just that.
All three victims used fear as a weapon,

215
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:44,768
and now this disease
is just returning the favor.

216
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:47,478
- I don't scare people.
- Dean, all we do is scare people.

217
00:12:49,376 --> 00:12:51,537
- Okay, then, you're a dick, too.
- Apparently, I'm not.

218
00:12:51,657 --> 00:12:53,550
Whatever.
How do we stop it?

219
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:55,802
We gank the ghost
that started all this.

220
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,765
We do that,
the disease should clear up.

221
00:12:57,885 --> 00:12:59,205
You thinking frank's wife?

222
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:01,158
Who knows why she killed herself,
you know?

223
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,718
What are you doing
waiting out here, anyway?

224
00:13:06,334 --> 00:13:08,109
Our room's on the fourth floor.

225
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,610
It's high.

226
00:13:15,724 --> 00:13:17,579
I'll see if I can move
us down to the first.

227
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:18,717
- Thanks.
- Sure.

228
00:14:29,031 --> 00:14:31,332
Everything all right?
Oh, yeah.

229
00:14:31,752 --> 00:14:32,625
Just peachy.

230
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:35,458
- Find anything?
- Yeah.

231
00:14:35,578 --> 00:14:37,922
Jessie o'brien's body was cremated,

232
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,887
so I'm pretty sure
she is not our ghost.

233
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:44,303
Quit picking at that.

234
00:14:45,422 --> 00:14:47,579
- How you feeling?
- Awesome.

235
00:14:48,374 --> 00:14:50,457
It's nice to have my head
on the chopping block again.

236
00:14:50,577 --> 00:14:52,645
I almost forgot
what that feels like.

237
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:56,135
- It's freaking delightful.
- We'll keep looking.

238
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,193
You okay?

239
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:03,030
Dean.

240
00:15:14,472 --> 00:15:16,896
We've been completely ignoring
the biggest clue we have --

241
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,016
You.

242
00:15:21,204 --> 00:15:23,521
- I don't want to be a clue.
- The abrasions, this --

243
00:15:23,641 --> 00:15:26,084
The disease,
it's trying to tell us something.

244
00:15:26,204 --> 00:15:28,029
Tell us what...
Wood chips?

245
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:30,099
Exactly.

246
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:04,609
I'm not going in there.

247
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:09,444
I need backup,
and you're all I've got.

248
00:16:11,993 --> 00:16:13,302
You're going in, dean.

249
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:25,026
Let's do this.

250
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,603
It is a little spooky, isn't it?

251
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,213
Oh, I'm not carrying that.

252
00:16:45,654 --> 00:16:46,774
It could go off.

253
00:16:50,146 --> 00:16:51,495
I'll man the flashlight.

254
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:53,974
You do that.

255
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,908
Emf's not gonna work
with me around, is it?

256
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:28,467
You don't say.

257
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:32,206
Come on.

258
00:17:34,914 --> 00:17:35,985
What --

259
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:42,896
"To frank.

260
00:17:43,254 --> 00:17:44,333
Love, jessie."

261
00:17:45,426 --> 00:17:46,715
Frank o'brien's ring.

262
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:49,779
What the hell was frank doing here?

263
00:17:50,592 --> 00:17:51,490
No idea.

264
00:18:32,771 --> 00:18:34,022
That was scary!

265
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
Wait.

266
00:19:05,718 --> 00:19:06,690
Luther garland.

267
00:19:10,906 --> 00:19:12,079
Hey, this is, uh...

268
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,418
... this is frank's wife.

269
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,501
Plot thickens.

270
00:19:18,522 --> 00:19:20,375
Yeah...
But into what?

271
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:15,885
Guess we got the right place.

272
00:20:22,024 --> 00:20:23,627
This is the guy on the file.

273
00:20:23,747 --> 00:20:24,929
Thanks.

274
00:20:33,518 --> 00:20:35,445
Is he... drunk?

275
00:20:40,525 --> 00:20:41,525
No.

276
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:45,300
Deputy, according to this,
luther garland's cause of death was

277
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,875
physical trauma.
What does that mean?

278
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,440
The guy died 20 years ago --

279
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,563
Before my time.
Sorry.

280
00:20:52,683 --> 00:20:54,397
Then can we talk to the sheriff?

281
00:20:55,308 --> 00:20:56,466
He's out sick today.

282
00:20:56,626 --> 00:20:58,562
Well, if you see him,
will you have him call us?

283
00:20:58,682 --> 00:21:00,314
We're staying at the bluebird.

284
00:21:00,434 --> 00:21:01,736
Mind if I take this?

285
00:21:06,408 --> 00:21:07,449
Know what?

286
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:10,898
You're awesome.

287
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:15,907
Thanks.

288
00:21:17,297 --> 00:21:18,933
Um, y-you too, I guess.

289
00:21:23,987 --> 00:21:24,987
<i>Who was that?</i>

290
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,001
It, uh -- those fbi guys.

291
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,259
<i>What did they want?</i>

292
00:21:30,003 --> 00:21:31,996
A file --
Luther garland's.

293
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,683
Sheriff?

294
00:21:42,662 --> 00:21:43,971
They know.

295
00:21:47,482 --> 00:21:48,543
They know.

296
00:21:51,876 --> 00:21:53,273
They know what you did,

297
00:21:54,524 --> 00:21:56,652
and they're gonna make you pay.

298
00:22:06,544 --> 00:22:07,829
This isn't gonna work.

299
00:22:08,171 --> 00:22:10,378
Come on, these badges are fake.
What if we get busted?

300
00:22:10,498 --> 00:22:12,252
- We could go to jail.
- Dean, shh!

301
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,377
Calm down.

302
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:14,753
Deep breath, okay?

303
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,937
There.
You feel better?

304
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:21,002
Just come on.

305
00:22:22,635 --> 00:22:23,748
Don't scratch.

306
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:34,022
Mr. Garland.

307
00:22:34,448 --> 00:22:35,448
Hi.

308
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:38,309
I'm agent tyler.
This is agent perry --

309
00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:39,232
FBI.

310
00:22:39,352 --> 00:22:41,793
We'd like to ask you a few
questions about your brother luther.

311
00:22:43,757 --> 00:22:45,443
Let me see some i. D.

312
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:46,743
Certainly.

313
00:22:58,623 --> 00:22:59,756
Those are real.

314
00:23:01,648 --> 00:23:02,811
Obviously.

315
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:07,066
I mean, who would pretend
to be an fbi agent, huh?

316
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:08,600
That's just nutty.

317
00:23:15,523 --> 00:23:16,981
What do you want to know?

318
00:23:17,774 --> 00:23:19,124
Uh, well...

319
00:23:19,978 --> 00:23:22,029
According to this,
your brother luther

320
00:23:22,307 --> 00:23:24,156
died of physical trauma.

321
00:23:24,316 --> 00:23:25,589
You don't agree.

322
00:23:26,062 --> 00:23:27,067
No, I don't.

323
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,119
Well, then, what would you call it?

324
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,913
Don't matter what an old man thinks.

325
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:34,631
Mr. Garland...

326
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:37,443
We're just trying to
get the truth on your brother.

327
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:38,563
Please.

328
00:23:44,927 --> 00:23:46,847
Everybody was scared of luther.

329
00:23:48,389 --> 00:23:50,098
They called him a monster.

330
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,394
He was too big, too mean-looking.

331
00:23:56,045 --> 00:23:58,346
Just too different.

332
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:06,661
Didn't matter he was
the kindest man I ever knew.

333
00:24:06,781 --> 00:24:09,249
Didn't matter he'd
never hurt no one.

334
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:17,212
A lot of people failed luther.

335
00:24:17,906 --> 00:24:19,415
I was one of them.

336
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:23,528
I was a widower
with three young'uns, and

337
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:27,555
I told myself there was nothing
I could do.

338
00:24:29,846 --> 00:24:31,413
Mr. Garland, um...

339
00:24:33,218 --> 00:24:34,870
Do you recognize this woman?

340
00:24:37,512 --> 00:24:39,287
It's jessie o'brien.

341
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:43,193
Her man, frank, killed luther.

342
00:24:45,872 --> 00:24:47,940
- How do you know that?
- Everybody knows.

343
00:24:48,761 --> 00:24:50,408
They just don't talk about it.

344
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,374
Jessie was a
receptionist at the mill.

345
00:24:56,675 --> 00:24:59,154
She was always real nice to luther,

346
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,920
and he had a crush on her.

347
00:25:02,288 --> 00:25:04,242
But frank didn't like it.

348
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:06,216
And when jessie went missing,

349
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,553
Frank was sure that luther
had done something to her.

350
00:25:11,671 --> 00:25:13,932
Turns out the old
gal killed herself,

351
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,892
but frank didn't know that.

352
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:49,646
They found luther with
a chain wrapped around his neck.

353
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:53,431
He was dragged up and down
the stretch outside that plant

354
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,325
till he was past dead.

355
00:25:55,652 --> 00:25:57,225
And o'brien was never arrested?

356
00:25:57,983 --> 00:25:59,978
I screamed to every cop in town.

357
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,772
They didn't want to look into frank.

358
00:26:02,932 --> 00:26:04,817
He was a pillar of the community.

359
00:26:05,352 --> 00:26:07,319
My brother was just the town freak.

360
00:26:07,861 --> 00:26:09,348
You must have hated frank o'brien.

361
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:11,865
I did for a long time, but...

362
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,201
Life's too short for hate, son.

363
00:26:14,903 --> 00:26:16,620
And frank wasn't thinking straight.

364
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,251
His wife had vanished.

365
00:26:18,448 --> 00:26:19,772
He was terrified.

366
00:26:20,536 --> 00:26:23,418
A damn shame he had to put luther
through the same, but...

367
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:25,455
That's fear.

368
00:26:26,843 --> 00:26:28,698
It spreads and spreads.

369
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:35,639
Now we know what these are --

370
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:36,769
Road rash,

371
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:39,130
and I'm guessing luther swallowed
some wood chips

372
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,425
when he was being dragged
down that road.

373
00:26:42,055 --> 00:26:43,335
Makes sense.

374
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,764
You're experiencing
his death in slow motion.

375
00:26:45,884 --> 00:26:47,576
Yeah, well, not slow enough, huh?

376
00:26:47,696 --> 00:26:50,195
Say we burn some bones
and get me healthy.

377
00:26:51,024 --> 00:26:52,364
Dean, it won't be that easy.

378
00:26:52,524 --> 00:26:54,188
No, no.
It'll be that easy.

379
00:26:54,734 --> 00:26:57,410
- Why wouldn't it be that easy?
- Luther was road-hauled.

380
00:26:58,249 --> 00:26:59,667
His body was ripped to pieces.

381
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:02,306
He was probably scattered
all over that road.

382
00:27:03,069 --> 00:27:05,449
There's no way we're
gonna find all the remains.

383
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:08,838
You're kidding me.

384
00:27:08,998 --> 00:27:11,151
Look, we'll just have
to figure something else out.

385
00:27:12,808 --> 00:27:14,219
You know what?
Screw this.

386
00:27:15,422 --> 00:27:17,138
- Come on.
- No, I mean, come on, sam.

387
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:19,936
What are we doing?!

388
00:27:20,303 --> 00:27:22,202
- We're hunting a ghost.
- A ghost -- exactly.

389
00:27:22,322 --> 00:27:23,513
Who does that?

390
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,878
- Us.
- Us? Right.

391
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,442
And that, Sam... That is exactly
why our lives suck.

392
00:27:29,726 --> 00:27:31,642
I mean, come on.
We hunt monsters!

393
00:27:31,762 --> 00:27:33,173
What the hell?!

394
00:27:33,381 --> 00:27:35,598
I mean, normal people,
they see a monster, and they run.

395
00:27:35,718 --> 00:27:37,492
But not us -- no, no, no.
We --

396
00:27:37,652 --> 00:27:39,890
We search out things
that want to kill us.

397
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,761
Yeah? Huh?
Or eat us!

398
00:27:42,859 --> 00:27:44,778
You know who does that?
Crazy people!

399
00:27:45,075 --> 00:27:46,980
We... are insane!

400
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,055
You know, and then there's
the bad diner food

401
00:27:50,175 --> 00:27:52,653
and then the skeevy motel rooms
and then the truck-stop waitress

402
00:27:52,773 --> 00:27:54,052
with the bizarre rash.

403
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,963
I mean, who wants this life, sam?

404
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:57,083
Huh? Seriously?

405
00:27:57,553 --> 00:28:00,042
Do you actually like being stuck in
a car with me eight hours a day,

406
00:28:00,162 --> 00:28:01,891
every single day?

407
00:28:02,051 --> 00:28:03,059
I don't think so!

408
00:28:03,219 --> 00:28:05,020
I drive too fast,
and I listen to the same

409
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,651
five albums over and over and
over again, a-and I sing along.

410
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:09,087
I'm annoying.
I know that.

411
00:28:09,207 --> 00:28:11,067
And you -- you're gassy!

412
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,767
You eat half a burrito,
and you get toxic!

413
00:28:13,887 --> 00:28:15,176
I mean, you know what?

414
00:28:15,565 --> 00:28:16,921
You can forget it.

415
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:18,901
Whoa, dean.
Where are you going?

416
00:28:19,021 --> 00:28:21,527
Stay away from me sam, okay?
'cause I am done with it.

417
00:28:21,647 --> 00:28:24,456
I'm done with the monsters
and -- and -- and the hellhounds

418
00:28:24,616 --> 00:28:26,666
and the ghost sickness
and the damn apocalypse.

419
00:28:27,365 --> 00:28:29,319
I'm out. I'm done.
Quit.

420
00:28:59,846 --> 00:29:01,785
I looked everywhere for you, dean.

421
00:29:02,087 --> 00:29:03,880
How the hell did you get here?

422
00:29:04,834 --> 00:29:05,830
Ran.

423
00:29:15,803 --> 00:29:17,166
What do we do now?

424
00:29:18,104 --> 00:29:20,358
I got less than four
hours on the clock.

425
00:29:23,192 --> 00:29:24,307
I'm gonna die, sammy.

426
00:29:25,085 --> 00:29:26,017
Yeah, you are.

427
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:29,187
You're going back.

428
00:29:30,382 --> 00:29:31,189
Back?

429
00:29:32,057 --> 00:29:33,858
Downstairs, dean -- hell.

430
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:37,125
It's about damn time, too.

431
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:38,738
Truth is,

432
00:29:39,307 --> 00:29:41,366
you've been a real pain in my ass.

433
00:29:45,555 --> 00:29:46,371
No!

434
00:29:46,531 --> 00:29:48,918
You get out of my brother,
you evil son of a bitch!

435
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:50,732
No one's possessing me, dean.

436
00:29:51,852 --> 00:29:53,420
This is what i'm going to become.

437
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,464
This is what I want to become.

438
00:29:56,732 --> 00:29:58,633
There's nothing you can do about it.

439
00:30:22,933 --> 00:30:24,669
- Howdy, sam.
- Hey, bobby.

440
00:30:25,755 --> 00:30:27,421
Hey, thanks for coming so quick.

441
00:30:29,018 --> 00:30:30,047
Where's dean?

442
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:34,561
Home sick.

443
00:30:43,238 --> 00:30:44,512
Oh, this isn't helping.

444
00:30:44,895 --> 00:30:47,035
So, have his
hallucinations started yet?

445
00:30:47,155 --> 00:30:48,308
Yeah, a few hours ago.

446
00:30:48,468 --> 00:30:49,852
How we doing on time?

447
00:30:49,972 --> 00:30:53,105
We saw the coroner about 8:00 a. M.
Monday morning, so, uh...

448
00:30:53,734 --> 00:30:55,138
Just under two hours.

449
00:30:56,002 --> 00:30:57,567
What about you?
You find anything?

450
00:30:57,727 --> 00:31:00,028
This, uh, encyclopedia of spirits

451
00:31:00,148 --> 00:31:01,833
dates to the edo period.

452
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,325
You can read japanese?

453
00:31:09,174 --> 00:31:10,591
Guess so, show-off.

454
00:31:11,115 --> 00:31:14,667
Anyway, this book lists a
kind of ghost that could be our guy.

455
00:31:15,093 --> 00:31:17,243
It, uh, infects people with fear.

456
00:31:17,363 --> 00:31:19,345
- It's called a buruburu.
- It say how to kill it?

457
00:31:19,465 --> 00:31:21,384
Same as usual --
Burn the remains.

458
00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:24,984
Wonderful.
Uh... is there a plan "b"?

459
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:29,347
Well, the buruburu is born of fear.

460
00:31:29,793 --> 00:31:31,350
Hell, it is fear.

461
00:31:31,797 --> 00:31:34,103
And the lore says
we can kill it with fear.

462
00:31:34,772 --> 00:31:36,735
So we have to scare
a ghost to death?

463
00:31:36,855 --> 00:31:37,732
Pretty much.

464
00:31:40,217 --> 00:31:41,819
How the hell we gonna do that?

465
00:31:49,862 --> 00:31:51,412
So, just ride out the trip, okay?

466
00:31:51,572 --> 00:31:53,672
<i>You're -- you're gonna be fine.
We got a plan.</i>

467
00:31:56,003 --> 00:31:56,867
What is it?

468
00:31:56,987 --> 00:31:58,554
<i>Uh, just a good plan, all right?</i>

469
00:31:58,674 --> 00:31:59,744
<i>Hang in there.</i>

470
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,552
This is a terrible plan.

471
00:32:05,712 --> 00:32:07,152
Yeah, tell me about it.

472
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,181
I know I said,
"scare the ghost to death," but this?

473
00:32:10,782 --> 00:32:12,934
You got a better idea,
i'm listening.

474
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:07,112
Sheriff?

475
00:33:08,818 --> 00:33:09,920
What are you doing?

476
00:33:10,564 --> 00:33:12,952
Why are you looking
into luther garland's death?

477
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:16,623
Hey, hey, you're -- you're sick.

478
00:33:16,783 --> 00:33:18,416
You're sick.
You're sick, all right?

479
00:33:18,576 --> 00:33:20,251
Just like me, okay?
You got to relax.

480
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:24,145
Frank o'brien was my friend.

481
00:33:24,624 --> 00:33:25,970
So he made a mistake.

482
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:28,382
So I didn't bust him.
So what?

483
00:33:30,147 --> 00:33:32,639
And you're gonna bring
me down over that?!

484
00:33:33,043 --> 00:33:34,114
No, sir.

485
00:34:08,709 --> 00:34:10,843
- Get away from me!
- Al, you got to calm down!

486
00:34:11,003 --> 00:34:12,106
Step back!

487
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,993
<i>Any luck?</i>

488
00:34:37,965 --> 00:34:40,076
I don't know what's wrong, bobby.

489
00:34:40,385 --> 00:34:42,291
Last time he came right at us.

490
00:34:42,676 --> 00:34:44,411
It's almost like he's, uh...

491
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,297
Like he's scared.

492
00:34:56,767 --> 00:34:57,724
<i>So now what?</i>

493
00:34:59,247 --> 00:35:01,081
I guess I got to make him angry.

494
00:35:05,555 --> 00:35:06,804
Hey, luther!

495
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:15,769
Come on, luther!

496
00:35:16,136 --> 00:35:17,594
Where the hell are you?

497
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:23,791
What are you waiting for?

498
00:35:43,705 --> 00:35:44,915
You're going back.

499
00:35:45,598 --> 00:35:47,068
It's about damn time, too.

500
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,584
Hi, dean.

501
00:36:11,307 --> 00:36:12,749
No. No.

502
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:13,669
Yes.

503
00:36:13,789 --> 00:36:15,346
It's me... Lilith.

504
00:36:15,831 --> 00:36:17,303
Oh, I missed you so much.

505
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:20,320
It's time to go back now.

506
00:36:23,608 --> 00:36:25,938
You -- you are not real!

507
00:36:27,049 --> 00:36:28,406
What's the matter, dean?

508
00:36:28,526 --> 00:36:30,525
Don't you remember all
the fun you had down there?

509
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,853
You do remember.

510
00:36:36,273 --> 00:36:38,115
4 months is like 40 years in hell.

511
00:36:38,753 --> 00:36:40,029
Like doggy years.

512
00:36:40,713 --> 00:36:42,736
And you remember every second.

513
00:36:48,261 --> 00:36:49,502
You are not real.

514
00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:52,288
It doesn't matter.

515
00:36:52,408 --> 00:36:54,122
You're still gonna die.

516
00:36:54,757 --> 00:36:56,676
You're still gonna burn.

517
00:36:59,575 --> 00:37:00,513
Why me?

518
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,181
Why'd I get infected?

519
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:03,879
Silly goose.

520
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:05,560
You know why, dean.

521
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,771
Listen to your heart.

522
00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:10,106
What?

523
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:49,290
Bobby, punch it!

524
00:38:58,296 --> 00:39:00,424
So you guys road hawl the ghost?

525
00:39:02,938 --> 00:39:04,069
With a chain?

526
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,935
Iron chain etched with a spell word.

527
00:39:09,137 --> 00:39:10,267
Now, that's a new one.

528
00:39:10,605 --> 00:39:12,637
It was what he was most afraid of.

529
00:39:12,757 --> 00:39:14,196
It was pretty brutal, though.

530
00:39:14,316 --> 00:39:16,232
On the upside,
i'm still alive, so...

531
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:18,402
- Go, team.
- Yeah.

532
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,167
How you feeling, by the way?

533
00:39:20,533 --> 00:39:21,381
Fine.

534
00:39:21,501 --> 00:39:22,613
You sure, dean?

535
00:39:23,341 --> 00:39:25,449
'cause this line of
work can get awful scary.

536
00:39:27,194 --> 00:39:28,285
I'm fine.

537
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,121
You want to go hunting?
I'll hunt.

538
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:31,823
I'll kill anything.

539
00:39:33,777 --> 00:39:35,086
He's adorable.

540
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:39,130
I got to get out of here.

541
00:39:39,994 --> 00:39:41,472
You boys drive safe.

542
00:39:41,998 --> 00:39:43,268
You too, bobby.

543
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,445
Hey, thanks.

544
00:40:00,781 --> 00:40:01,861
So, uh...

545
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,611
So, what did you see?

546
00:40:03,915 --> 00:40:05,175
Near the end, I mean.

547
00:40:05,295 --> 00:40:06,953
Oh, besides a cop beating my ass?

548
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:08,073
Seriously.

549
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,711
Howler monkeys.

550
00:40:19,605 --> 00:40:21,132
Whole roomful of them.

551
00:40:21,341 --> 00:40:23,549
- Those things creep the hell out of me.
- Right.

552
00:40:24,921 --> 00:40:27,196
No, no, just the usual stuff, sammy.

553
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:29,583
Nothing I couldn't handle.
