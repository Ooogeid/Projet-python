1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,090
How little?

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:03,230
Providence,Rhode Island

3
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:05,490
Like when you put on "a little" eye shadow.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,090
And,you know,all this stuff,
it's just very unprofessional.

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,090
Don't touch the troll!

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,150
Is that what your mom used to say to your dates?

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,720
Put the trolls down,or I'll put a
staple right between your eyes.

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,300
Now,I know it's hard.

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,000
It's hard to look up when you're down.

10
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,960
It's hard to look up and see the light.

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,740
But I'm here to tell you folks...

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,920
the lord is with you.

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,660
You don't have to suffer.

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,710
You don't have to be lost.

15
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,980
The lord is talking to you right now.

16
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,460
He's saying,"you are my child,and you have a purpose.¡±

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,800
You think god forgot about you?
I tell you,no!

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,680
All you got to do is listen.

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,490
Can't you just hear those angels singing?

20
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,190
Isn't it beautiful?

21
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,710
It's time.

22
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,390
It's time to receive the message he's sending.

23
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,710
It's time to listen to the word of god!

24
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,300
Can you hear the glory?

25
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,910
I said,can't you just hear it?
I say,can't you just hear the lord?

29
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,950
Good morning.
You're not the usual guy.

30
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,740
No,uh...

31
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,970
just filling in.

32
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,460
So,how you feeling today,gloria?

33
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,530
I've never felt better.

34
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,460
So,no disturbances lately?

35
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,280
You mean,am I stark-raving cuckoo for cocoa puffs?

36
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,720
I didn't say that.

37
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,010
It's all right.
I know what people must think.

38
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,620
What do you think?

39
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,790
I think what I saw was real.

40
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,770
"Houses Of The Holy"

41
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,900
I'd like to know what you saw.

42
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,810
It was all over the news.
I stabbed a man in the heart.

43
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,930
Why would you do that?

44
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,860
Because it was god's will.

45
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,010
Did god talk to you?

46
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,400
I get the sense god's a little busy for house calls.

47
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,730
No,he --
he sent someone.

48
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,140
Someone?

49
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,330
An angel.

50
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,130
It came to me in this beautiful white light.

51
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,820
And it filled me with this...

52
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,970
feeling.

53
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,790
It's --
it's hard to describe.

54
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,580
And this angel...

55
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,510
spoke god's word.

56
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,860
And the word was to kill someone?

57
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,840
I know it sounds strange.

58
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,720
But what I did was very important.

59
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,710
I helped him smite an evil man.

60
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:50,040
I was chosen...for redemption.

61
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,550
This man you stabbed --
did the angel give you his name?

62
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,930
No.

63
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,430
He just told me to wait for the sign,
and the very next day,

64
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,810
I saw it right beside the man's doorway,and I knew.

65
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,200
Why him?

66
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,640
I just know what the angel told me --

67
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,010
that this man was guilty to his deepest foundations.

68
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,580
And that was good enough for me.

69
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,720
Hey!

70
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,370
Hey!

71
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,870
Hey,man,you got to try this.
I mean,there really is magic in the magic fingers.

72
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,140
Dean,you're enjoying that way too much.
It's kind of making me uncomfortable.

73
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,430
XXXXXXXXX You got me on lockdown here.
I'm bored out of my skull.

74
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,240
Hey,you were the bank robber on the 11:00 news,not me.

75
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,590
We can't risk you just walking into
a government facility.

76
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,030
Aw,damn it.

77
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,170
That was my last quarter.

78
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,750
Hey!

79
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,950
You got any quarters?

80
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,120
No.

81
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,630
- So,did you get in to see that crazy hooker?
- Yeah.

82
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,040
Gloria sitnik.
And I'm not so sure she's crazy.

83
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,600
But she seriously believes that she was...
touched by an angel?

84
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
Yeah.

85
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,600
Blinding light,feelingsof spiritual ecstasy,the works.

86
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,420
I mean,she's living in a locked ward,
and she's totallyat peace.

87
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,000
Oh,yeah,you're right --
sounds completely sane.

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,650
What about the dudeshe stabbed?

89
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,810
Uh,carl gulley.
Said she killed him'cause he was evil.

90
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,110
- Was he?
- I don't know.

91
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,030
I couldn't findany dirt on him.

92
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,110
He didn't havea criminal record,
he worked at the campus library,

93
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,640
had lots of friends,was a churchgoer.

94
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,020
So gloria's just your standard-issue wacko?

95
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,440
I mean,she wouldn't bethe first nut job in history

96
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,500
to kill in the name of religion,know what I mean?

97
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,020
No,but she'sthe second in town to
murderbecause an angel told them to.

98
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,680
Little bit odd,don't you think?

99
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,370
Odd -- yeah.
Supernatural -- maybe.

100
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,540
But angels -- I don't think so.

101
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,880
Why not?

102
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,650
'Cause there'sno such thing,sam.

103
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,310
Dean,there's 10 timesas much lore about angels as
there is about anything elsewe've ever hunted.

104
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,610
There's a ton of loreon unicorns,too.

105
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,910
I hear that they rideon silver moonbeams
and they shoot rainbowsout of their ass.

106
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,560
Wait,there's no such thingas unicorns?

107
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,440
That's cute.

108
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,370
I'm just saying,man,there's some legends
that you just fileunder "bull crap.¡±

109
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,750
And you got angelson the "bull crap" list?

110
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,570
- Yep.
- Why?

111
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,590
- Because I've neverseen one.
- So what?

112
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,950
So I believe inwhat I can see.

113
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,130
Dean,you and ihave seen things
most peoplecouldn't even dream about.

114
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,480
Exactly.

115
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,160
With our own eyes --
that's hard proof,okay?

116
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,210
But in all this time,I have never seen
anythingthat looks like an angel.

117
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:12,080
Don't you think we would have crossed paths with them
or at least know someone that crossed paths with them?

118
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,120
No.
This is a demon or a spirit.

119
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,790
They find people a few friesshort of a happy meal,
and they trick theminto killing these randoMs.

120
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,860
Maybe.

121
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,030
Can we just -- I'm going stir-crazy,man.
Let's go by gloria'sapartment,huh?

122
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,880
I was just there.

123
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,920
Nothing.
No sulfur,no E.M.F.

124
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,420
You didn't see any fluffy,white wing feathers?

125
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,410
But gloria did saythe angel gave her
a sign right besidecarl gulley's doorway.

126
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,670
Could be something at his house.
It's worth checking out.

127
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,980
Hey,sam.

128
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,300
Think I found it.

129
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,300
It's a sign from up above.

130
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,460
I think I learneda valuable lesson.

131
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:37,230
Always take downyour christmas decorations after new year's,
or you might get filletedby a hooker from god.

132
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,700
I'm laughingon the inside.

133
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,000
You know,gloria said the guy was guiltyto
his deepest foundations.

134
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,110
You think she literallymeant the foundation?

135
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,410
You got something?

136
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,150
What is it?

137
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,550
It's a fingernail.

138
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,880
So much for the innocent church going librarian.

139
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,410
Whatever spoke to gloria about
this knew what it was talkingabout --

140
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:38,020
I'll give you that.

141
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,540
Yes?

142
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,000
Hi.
My name is zach.

143
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,230
Can I help you?

144
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,250
Did you bring quarters?

145
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,970
Dude,

146
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,850
I'm not enabling your sick habit.

147
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:18,660
You're likeone of those lab rats that pushes
the pleasure buttoninstead of the food button until it dies.

148
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,590
What are you talking about?
I eat.And I got news.

149
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,300
- Me too.
- All right,you go first.

150
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,330
Three students have disappearedoff the campus this year.
All of them were last seenat the library.

151
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,040
- Where carl gulley worked.
- yep.

152
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,650
- Sick bastard.
- So gloria's angel --

153
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,410
- angel?
- Okay,whatever this thing is.

154
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,850
- Whatever it is,it struck again.
- What?

155
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,110
I was listeningto the police radio before you got here.

156
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,850
There was this guy,zach smith,some local drunk.

157
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,020
He went up to a stranger'sfront door last night,
stabbed him in the heart.

158
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,480
I'm guessing he wentto the police and confessed?

159
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,630
Yep.
Roma downey made him do it.

160
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,360
Now,I,uh...

161
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,090
got the victim's address.

162
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,650
Find anything?

163
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,010
Frank likedhis catalog shopping.
That's about all I got. You?

164
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,170
Not much here.

165
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,250
Except he's got this one lockedfile on his computer that...

166
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,360
hold on.

167
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,570
Not anymore.

168
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,010
God.

169
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,420
What?

170
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:00,000
He's gotall these e-mails,dozens,
to this ladynamed jennifer.

171
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,600
This ladywho's 13 years old.

172
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,840
Oh,I don't wantto hear this.

173
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,080
Looks like they metin a chat room.

174
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,930
These e-mailsare pretty personal,dean.

175
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,600
Look at that.

176
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,050
- Setting up a time and place to meet.
- Great.

177
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,870
They were supposed to meettoday.

178
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,090
Well,I guess if you'regonna stab someone,good timing.

179
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,470
I don't know,man.
This is weird.

180
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:39,220
I mean,sure,some spiritsare out for vengeance,
but this one's almostlike a do-gooder,like a --

181
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,260
avenging angel?

182
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,540
Well,how elsedo you explain it,dean?

183
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,730
Three guys not connectedto each other
all stabbedthrough the heart?

184
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,550
At least twowere world-class pervs,

185
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,650
and I bet if you dug deep enoughon the other guy --

186
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,180
- hey.
- What?

187
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,570
You said carl gulleywas a churchgoer,right?

188
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,400
- Yeah.
- What was the nameof his church?

189
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,330
our lady of the angels?

190
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,220
Of course that would bethe name.

191
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,540
Looks like frank wentto the same church.

192
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,130
So,you're interestedin joining the parish?

193
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,930
We just don't feel right unlesswe hit church every sunday.

194
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,320
Where'd you sayyou lived before?

195
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,520
- Premont,texas.
- Really? That's a nice town.

196
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,730
St.Teresa's parish.
You must knowthe priest there.

197
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,280
Sure,yeah.
No,it's fr.O'malley.

198
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,580
I knowa fr.Shaughnessy.

199
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,630
Shaughnessy,exactly.
What did I say?

200
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,770
You know,we're just happyto be here now,father.

201
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,840
And we're happyto have you.
We could usesome young blood around here.

202
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,350
I got to ask --
no offense,but the neighborhood...

203
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,470
it's gone to seed a little.
There's no denying that.

204
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:52,230
But that's why what the churchdoes here is so important.

205
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,110
Like I always say,you can expect a miracle,
but in the meantime,you work your butt off.

206
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,740
- Yeah,we heardabout the murders.
- yes.

207
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,430
The victims were parishionersof mine.
I've known them for years.

208
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,530
And the killers said thatan angel made them do that?

209
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,550
Yes.
Misguided souls.

210
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,170
To thinkthat god's messenger would appear
and incite peopleto murder --

211
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,260
it's tragic.

212
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,620
So,you don't believein those angel yarns,huh?

213
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:17,390
Oh,no,I absolutely believe.
It kind of goeswith the job description.

214
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,890
Father,that's michael,right?

215
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,690
That's right.

216
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:25,150
The archangel michael,with the flaming sword --

217
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:30,140
the fighter of demons,holy force against evil.

218
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,360
So,they're not reallythe hallmark-card
version that everybody thinks?

219
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,100
They're fierce,right?
Vigilant.

220
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,910
I like to think of themas more loving than wrathful,but,

221
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,950
yes,a lot of scripture paints angelsas god's warriors.

222
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,210
"An angel of the lord appeared to them,

223
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:53,340
"the glory of the lordshone down upon them,
and they were terrified.¡±

224
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,490
Luke 2:9.

225
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,650
- Well,thank youfor speaking with us,father.
- It's my pleasure.

226
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:13,020
- Hope to see you again.
- Father,what's all that for?

227
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,380
Oh,that's for fr.Gregory.
He was a priest here.

228
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,610
Was?

229
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,600
Passed awayright on these steps.

230
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,790
He's interredin the church crypt.

231
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,020
- When did this happen?
- Two months ago.

232
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,640
He was shot for his car keys.

233
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,570
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah,me too.

234
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,140
He was a good friend.

235
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,280
I didn't even have time to administer his last rites.

236
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,430
But like I said,it's a tough neighborhood.

237
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,400
And ever since he died,I've been praying my heart out.

238
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,510
For what?

239
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,830
For deliverance...

240
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,600
from the violenceand the bloodshed around here.

241
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,040
We could use a little divine intervention,I suppose.

242
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,460
Well,padre,thanks.
We'll see you again.

243
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,470
Well,it's all startingto make sense.

244
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,860
Devoted priestdies a violent death --

245
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,350
that's vengeful-spirit material right there.

246
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,530
He knew all the stiffs'cause they went to church here.

247
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:22,550
I'm willing to bet,because he was their priest,
he knew things about them that nobody else knew.

248
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:27,470
Then again,fr.Reynoldsstarted praying for
god's help about two months ago,right?

249
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,410
Right about the timeall this started?

250
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,350
Oh,come on,man.
What's your deal?

251
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,310
What do you mean?

252
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,680
Look,I'll admit,I'm a bit of a skeptic,
but since when are youall Mr. "700 club?¡±

253
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,950
Seriously,from the get-go,
you've been willing to buythis angel crap,man.

254
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,490
What's next?
Are you gonnastart praying every day?

255
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,080
I do.

256
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,350
What?

257
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,310
I do pray every day.

258
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,720
I have for a long time.

259
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,380
The things you learn about a guy.

260
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,840
Come on.
Let's go check out fr. Gregory's grave.

261
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,020
Sam,come on,get the lead out.

262
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,270
Sammy?

263
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,780
Sammy!
Hey.

264
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,970
- Okay?
- Yeah.

265
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,790
Yeah.

266
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,380
I'm okay.

267
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,560
Come on.

268
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,120
You saw it,didn't you?

269
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,910
- Didn't you?
- Yeah.

270
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,310
Yeah.
Dean,I saw an angel.

271
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,310
You --

272
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,150
all right,come on.

273
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,760
I don't want a drink.

274
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,740
So,what makes you thinkyou saw a,uh,angel?

275
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,510
Just...

276
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,790
it appeared before me,and I just --

277
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,570
this feeling washed over me,you know?
Like --

278
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,790
like peace,like grace.

279
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,360
Okay,ecstasy boy,maybe we'll get you some
glow sticksand a nice Dr. Seuss hat,huh?

280
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,120
Dean,I'm serious.

281
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,050
It spoke to me.
It knew who I was.

282
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,340
It's just a spirit,sam.

283
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,560
And it's not the first one to
be able to readpeople's minds.

284
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,990
Okay,let me guess --
you were personally chosento smite some sinner?

285
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:14,770
You just got to waitfor some divine bat signal.
Is that it?

286
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,330
Yeah,actually.

287
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,130
Great.

288
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,030
I don't suppose you askedwhat this alleged bad guy did.

289
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:24,680
Actually,I did,dean,and the angel told me.

290
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,640
He hasn't done anything...
yet.

291
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,440
But he will.

292
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,730
Oh,this is --
I don't believe this.

293
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:35,170
Dean,the angelhasn't been wrong yet.

294
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:38,070
Someone's gonna do somethingawful,and I can stop it.

295
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:41,800
You're supposed tobe bad,too,sam.
Maybe I shouldstop you right now.

296
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,810
You know what,dean?
I don't understand.

297
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,020
Why can't you even considerthe possibility?

298
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,030
- What,that this is an angel?
- Yes.

299
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,110
Maybe we're hunting an angelhere,and we should stop.

300
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,780
Maybe this is god's will.

301
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,650
Okay.
All right.

302
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:59,220
You know what? I get it.
You've got faith.

303
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,030
That's -- hey,good for you.
I'm sureit makes things easier.

304
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,290
I'll tell you who elsehad faith like that --
mom.

305
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,800
She used to tell mewhen she tucked me in
that angelswere watching over us.

306
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,080
In fact,that was the last thingshe ever said to me.

307
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,610
You never told me that.

308
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,440
What's to tell?

309
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,250
She was wrong.

310
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,950
There was nothingprotecting her.

311
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,340
There's no higher power.
There's no god.

312
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,730
There's just chaosand violence and random,

313
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:33,810
unpredictable evilthat comes out of nowhere

314
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,300
and rips you to shreds.

315
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,130
You want me to believein this stuff?

316
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,580
I'm gonna need to seesome hard proof.
You got any?

317
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,790
Well,I do.

318
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,300
Proof that we're dealingwith a spirit.

319
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,040
- That looks like --
- it's wormwood...

320
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:04,140
a plant associatedwith the dead,
specifically the onesthat are not at rest.

321
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,090
I don't see it growinganywhere else,
except overthe murdered priest's marker.

322
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,330
It's him,sam.

323
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,670
Maybe.

324
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,150
Maybe?

325
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,090
Dean,I don't knowwhat to think.

326
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,970
Okay.

327
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,840
Want some more proof?
I'll give you more proof.

328
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,370
How?

329
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,480
We'll summon gregory's spirit.

330
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,880
What?

331
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,590
Here?
In the church?

332
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,810
Yeah.

333
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:40,180
Yeah,we just needa few odds and ends and
that séance ritualin dad's journal.

334
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,910
A séance,great.
I hope whoopi's available.

335
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,790
That's funny,actually.
Seriously.

336
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,200
If fr.Gregory's spiritis around,
the séance will bring himright to us.

337
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,560
If it's him,then we'll put him to rest.

338
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,980
But if it's an angel,it won't show.

339
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,440
- Nothing will happen.
- Exactly.

340
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,630
It's one of the perksof the job,sam.
We don't have to operateon faith.

341
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,210
We can know for sure.

342
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,380
Don't you want to knowfor sure?

343
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,350
Dude...

344
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,200
all right,I'll admit,we've gone pretty ghettowith
the spell work before, ut this takes the cake.

345
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,410
I mean,a spongebob place matinstead of an altar cloth?

346
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,850
We'll just put itspongebob-side-down.

347
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,600
Dean,that's it.

348
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,810
What?

349
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,860
That's the sign.

350
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,170
Where?

351
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,500
Right behind that guy.

352
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,820
That's him,dean.
And we have to stop him.

353
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,920
- wait a minute.
- What are you doing? Let me go.

354
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,970
You're not gonna kill somebodybecause
a ghost told you to.

355
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,580
XXXXXX I'm not gonna kill him.
I'm gonna stop him.

356
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,200
Define "stop," huh?
I mean,what are you gonna do?

357
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:03,750
Dean,please.
He's gonna hurt someone. You know it.

358
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,230
All right,come on.

359
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,290
Dean.

360
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,700
Unlock my door.

361
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,670
You're not killing anyone,sam.

362
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,840
I got this guy.
You go do the séance.

363
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,350
Dean.

364
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,460
What are you doing?

365
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,620
What is this?

366
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,310
Father,please.
I can explain.

367
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,840
actually,maybe I can'T.
Um...

368
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,830
this is A...

369
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,290
- a séance.
- A séance?

370
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,540
Young man,you are in a house of god.

371
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,180
It's based on early christianrites,if that helps.

372
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,980
Enough.
You're coming with me.

373
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,600
Father,please,just wait a second.

374
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,480
Oh,my god.

375
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,290
Is that...

376
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,520
is that an angel?

377
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,440
No,it's not.

378
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,000
It's just fr.Gregory.

379
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,050
Thomas!

380
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,600
I've come in answerto your prayers.

381
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,000
Sam....

382
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,770
I thought I sent youon your path.
You should hurry.

383
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,930
Father,I'm sorry.

384
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,010
But you're not an angel.

385
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,970
Of course I am.

386
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,550
No.

387
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,990
You're a man.

388
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,990
You're a spirit.

389
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,930
And you need to rest.

390
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,070
I was a man...

391
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,440
but now I'm an angel.

392
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,690
I was on the stepsat the church.

393
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,570
I felt that bulletpierce right through me.

394
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,400
But there was no pain.

395
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,490
And,suddenly,I could see...

396
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,400
everything.

397
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,960
Fr.Reynolds,I saw you...

398
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,480
praying and crying here.

399
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,800
I came to help you.

400
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,060
Help me how?

401
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,700
Damn it!

402
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,840
Those murders --

403
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,390
that was becauseof you?

404
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,600
I receivedthe word of god.

405
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,890
He spoke to me,told me to smite the wicked.

406
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,390
I'm carrying outhis will.

407
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,380
You're driving innocent peopleto kill.

408
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,640
Those innocent people are being offered redemption.

409
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:07,210
Some peopleneed redemption.
Don't they,sam?

410
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,840
How can you call thisredemption?

411
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,700
You can'tunderstand it now.

412
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,280
But the rules of manand the rules of
god are twovery different things.

413
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,500
Those people --

414
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,570
they're locked up.

415
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,690
No,they're happy.

416
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:28,630
They've found peace,beaten their demons.
And I've given themthe keys to heaven.

417
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:33,240
No,no.
This is vengeance.It's wrong.

418
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,240
Thomas,this goes againsteverything you believed.

419
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,620
You're lost,misguided.

420
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,010
Father...

421
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,410
no,I'm not misguided.

422
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,950
You are not an angel,thomas.

423
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,800
Men cannot be angels.

424
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,610
But...

425
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,840
but I-I don't understand.

426
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,420
You prayed for meto come.

427
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,240
I prayed for god's help,not this.

428
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,400
What you're doingis not god's will.

429
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:11,520
"Thou shalt not kill.¡± That's the word of god.

430
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,560
How come we stopped?

431
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,300
Um,weren't we gonna goto the movies?

432
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,430
We should go,or we're gonna be late.

433
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,380
I'm sorry.
It's just,I've never done this before.

434
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,470
Look,I said I was sorry.

435
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,010
Please...

436
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,550
stop it!

437
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,790
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

438
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:12,120
Thank god!
Thank god!

439
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,530
Damn it.
Are you sureyou're okay?

440
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,250
You have a cellphone?
Call 911.

441
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,140
Let us help you.

442
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,970
No.

443
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:46,140
It's time to rest,thomas,to be at peace.
Please.

444
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,590
Let me give you last rites.

445
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:00,960
O holy hosts above,
I call upon theeas a servant of christ

446
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,800
to sanctifyour actions this day in
fulfillmentof the will of god.

447
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,880
Fr.Reynolds?

448
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,970
Rest.

449
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,570
I call uponthe archangel raphael,

450
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,830
master of the air,to make open the way.

451
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:38,010
Let the fire of the holy spiritnow descend,

452
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:42,670
that this being might beawakened to the world beyond.

453
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,640
Holy...

454
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,370
How was your day?

455
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,560
You were right.

456
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,840
It wasn't an angel.
It was gregory.

457
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,910
I don't know,dean,I just...

458
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,900
I wanted to believe...

459
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,220
so badly.

460
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,410
It's so damn hardto do this --

461
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,430
what we do --

462
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,530
all alone,you know?

463
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,800
There's so much evilout in the world,dean,
I feel like I could drownin it.

464
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,540
And when I thinkabout my destiny,
when I think abouthow I could end up...

465
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,910
yeah,well,don't worryabout that,all right?

466
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,160
I'm watching out for you.

467
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,530
Yeah,I know you are.

468
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,080
But you're just one person,dean.

469
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,430
And I needed to think that there was
something elsewatching,too,you know?

470
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,750
Some...

471
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,370
higher power,some greater good.

472
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,120
And that maybe...

473
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:34,950
maybe what?

474
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,610
Maybe I could be saved.

475
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,380
but,

476
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:53,080
you know,that just clouded my judgment.
And you're right.

477
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:58,380
I mean,we got to gowith what we know,
with what's right therein front of our own two eyes.

478
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,940
Well,it's funny you say that.

479
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,150
why?

480
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,050
Gregory's spirit gave yousome pretty good information.

481
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:15,710
That guy in the carwas bad news.
I barely got therein time.

482
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,370
What happened?

483
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,140
He's dead.

484
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,520
Did you...

485
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,380
no.

486
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:32,060
But I'll tell youone thing.

487
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:38,090
The way he died,if I hadn't have seen it
with my own two eyes,I neverwould have believed it.

488
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,740
I mean...

489
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,290
I don't knowwhat to call it.

490
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,340
what?

491
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,080
dean,what did you see?

492
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,620
Maybe...

493
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:03,230
...god's will.
