1
00:00:03,946 --> 00:00:05,383
Good night, Love.

2
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:06,968
Sweet dreams, Sam.

3
00:00:08,016 --> 00:00:10,096
Sammy, you're my favourite.

4
00:00:10,256 --> 00:00:12,889
Does this mean I
have demon blood in me?

5
00:00:14,177 --> 00:00:15,255
It's you.

6
00:00:20,299 --> 00:00:21,299
Mary?

7
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:25,646
The goal in life has been
searching for this demon.

8
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:28,126
That thing killed Jess,
that thing killed mum.

9
00:00:30,047 --> 00:00:31,785
- I'm sorry
- For what?

10
00:00:31,945 --> 00:00:33,370
- Who are you?
- Castiello,

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,001
I'm the one who gripped you
tight and raised you from perdition.

12
00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:38,390
- I mean, what are you?
- I'm an angel of the Lord.

13
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,920
Samuel Colt made a special gun,
this gun can kill anything.

14
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:47,300
Why would an angel rescue me from Hell?

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,219
Because God commanded it.

16
00:00:50,088 --> 00:00:51,761
Because we have work for you.

17
00:01:33,475 --> 00:01:34,475
Ready?

18
00:01:35,292 --> 00:01:36,292
Definitely.

19
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,208
Hello, dean.

20
00:01:58,406 --> 00:02:00,540
And what were you dreaming about?

21
00:02:03,817 --> 00:02:06,421
You get your freak on
by watching other people sleep?

22
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:07,964
What do you want?

23
00:02:08,331 --> 00:02:09,533
Listen to me.

24
00:02:10,734 --> 00:02:12,135
You have to stop it.

25
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:13,542
Stop what?

26
00:02:16,498 --> 00:02:17,665
Move it, buddy.

27
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:20,935
- You can't sleep here.
- Okay.

28
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:23,660
- Sleep where?
- Anywhere but here.

29
00:02:55,232 --> 00:02:56,012
Perfect.

30
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:22,071
Where the hell am i?

31
00:03:22,771 --> 00:03:23,832
Jay bird's diner.

32
00:03:26,017 --> 00:03:28,490
Yeah, thanks.
I mean, uh, city and state.

33
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:32,131
Lawrence, Kansas.

34
00:03:33,321 --> 00:03:34,217
Lawrence.

35
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,729
Are you okay, buddy?

36
00:03:38,588 --> 00:03:39,666
Tough night.

37
00:03:40,935 --> 00:03:43,102
Hey, uh, coffee here, reg.

38
00:03:46,046 --> 00:03:49,065
Can you tell me where I can get
reception on this thing?

39
00:03:50,367 --> 00:03:51,693
The U. S. S Enterprise?

40
00:03:55,547 --> 00:03:56,556
Thanks.

41
00:03:56,773 --> 00:03:57,679
Nice threads.

42
00:03:57,799 --> 00:03:59,911
You know sonny and cher broke up, right?

43
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:02,267
Sonny and cher broke up?

44
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:29,845
Hey, winchester!

45
00:04:31,477 --> 00:04:33,624
Son of a bitch!
How you doin', corporal?

46
00:04:33,744 --> 00:04:35,463
- Hey, Mr. D.
- I heard you were back.

47
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,808
Yeah, a little while now.

48
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:38,956
Good to have you home,
john -- damn good.

49
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:41,463
- Dad?
- Say hello to your old man for me.

50
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:42,935
You got it, Mr. D.

51
00:04:49,772 --> 00:04:51,083
Do we know each other?

52
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:55,924
I guess not.

53
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,653
Take it easy, pal.

56
00:05:43,608 --> 00:05:44,514
What is this?

57
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,933
- What does it look like?
- Is it real?

58
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:47,977
Very.

59
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,265
Okay, so, what, angels got
their hands on some deloreans?

60
00:05:50,385 --> 00:05:51,703
How did I get here?

61
00:05:52,712 --> 00:05:54,816
Time is fluid, dean.

62
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:57,841
It's not easy,
but we can bend it on occasion.

63
00:05:57,961 --> 00:06:00,071
Bend it back.
Or tell me what the hell I'm doing here.

64
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:01,451
I told you.

65
00:06:02,132 --> 00:06:03,282
You have to stop it.

66
00:06:03,442 --> 00:06:04,442
Stop what? Huh?

67
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:06,494
What, is there something
nasty after my dad?

68
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:13,139
Come on.

69
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:16,546
What, are you allergic to straight
answers, you son of a bitch?!

70
00:06:16,868 --> 00:06:19,736
Fine young man like
yourself just starting out.

71
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,083
How about I take off another $250?

72
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,086
Let's do it.

73
00:06:26,206 --> 00:06:27,743
I'll get the paperwork.

74
00:06:35,834 --> 00:06:37,499
That's not the one you want.

75
00:06:38,938 --> 00:06:39,944
You following me?

76
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:42,217
No, no.
I was just passing by.

77
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:44,905
I never got to thank you
for that cup of coffee this morning.

78
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:47,038
- I was a little out of it.
- More than a little.

79
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:48,591
Let me repay the favor.

80
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,574
This is the car you want.

81
00:06:51,694 --> 00:06:53,875
Oh, yeah? You know something about cars?

82
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:55,647
Yeah.

83
00:06:56,142 --> 00:06:58,271
Yeah, my dad taught
me everything I know.

84
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:01,340
And this --
This is a great car.

85
00:07:05,483 --> 00:07:08,362
327 four-barrel, 275 horses.

86
00:07:08,482 --> 00:07:10,518
A little tlc, this thing is cherry.

87
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,353
You know, man...

88
00:07:13,148 --> 00:07:14,258
You're right.

89
00:07:14,695 --> 00:07:16,314
What are you buying that thing for?

90
00:07:17,493 --> 00:07:18,941
Kind of promised someone I would.

91
00:07:19,758 --> 00:07:21,571
Over a'67 chevy?

92
00:07:22,187 --> 00:07:24,450
I mean, come on.
This is the car of a lifetime.

93
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:27,533
Trust me, this thing's still
gonna be badass when it's 40.

94
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:33,431
John winchester.

95
00:07:34,993 --> 00:07:36,005
Thanks.

96
00:07:37,093 --> 00:07:38,285
Dean van halen.

97
00:07:38,494 --> 00:07:39,648
And thank you.

98
00:07:45,857 --> 00:07:47,768
I was in pretty rough
shape this morning, huh?

99
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:48,932
No kidding.

100
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:51,765
I've been hung over before, but,

101
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:54,459
I was getting chills in that diner.

102
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:57,071
You didn't feel any of
those cold spots, did you?

103
00:07:57,191 --> 00:07:58,191
Nope.

104
00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:01,806
I swore I smelled something weird,
too, you know?

105
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:03,629
Like rotten eggs.

106
00:08:04,547 --> 00:08:06,807
You didn't happen to smell any sulfur,
by chance?

107
00:08:06,927 --> 00:08:07,927
- No.
- No.

108
00:08:09,817 --> 00:08:11,704
Have there been any
cattle mutilations in town?

109
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,579
Okay, mister, stop it.

110
00:08:14,672 --> 00:08:16,856
Yeah.
If only I knew what to stop.

111
00:08:19,777 --> 00:08:20,808
Listen, uh...

112
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,797
Watch out for yourself, okay?

113
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,051
Yeah. Sure.

114
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:37,511
So?

115
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:41,899
I'll take this one.

116
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:09,177
What's this?

117
00:09:09,462 --> 00:09:10,551
My car.

118
00:09:10,671 --> 00:09:11,993
What happened to the van?

119
00:09:12,113 --> 00:09:15,850
Mary, this is better than the van.
It's got a 327, a 4-barrel carburetor.

120
00:09:17,693 --> 00:09:18,693
Mom.

121
00:09:27,612 --> 00:09:29,750
Sammy, wherever you are...

122
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:32,116
Mom is a babe.

123
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:35,201
I'm going to hell.

124
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:36,871
Again.

125
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:38,557
I should just talk to him.

126
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:40,750
My dad's being my dad, john.
It's not you.

127
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,294
How is it not me?
He's been like this for how many years?

128
00:09:43,454 --> 00:09:45,690
He's just protective over me,
that's all.

129
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,089
He's doesn't want me to...

130
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:49,993
Hook up with a mechanic
from a family of mechanics?

131
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:50,934
No.

132
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:57,960
I love you for exactly what you are.

133
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:00,728
I'll be right back.

134
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,578
Why are you following us?

135
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,209
Are you crazy?

136
00:10:26,801 --> 00:10:29,611
You've been trailing us since my house.
I don't know what you're talking about.

137
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:30,731
Oh, really?

138
00:10:35,308 --> 00:10:37,682
- Okay, how about we talk about this?
- Let me go!

139
00:10:46,556 --> 00:10:47,608
Are you a hunter?

140
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,562
- See you later.
- If you're lucky.

141
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:26,983
Dean, right?

142
00:11:31,181 --> 00:11:32,609
I'm not sure you should come in.

143
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:35,609
You can trust me, I mean come on,
we're all hunters, right?

144
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,117
I mean, we're...

145
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:38,762
practically family.

146
00:11:39,292 --> 00:11:41,579
The thing is,
my dad, he's a little, um...

147
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:42,997
Oh, I got to meet him.

148
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,894
You've heard of him?

149
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,431
Clearly, not enough.

150
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,043
So, you're a hunter?

151
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:51,608
Tell me something, Mr. Hunter,

152
00:11:51,728 --> 00:11:53,799
You kill vampires with
wooden stakes or silver?

153
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:55,229
Neither.

154
00:11:55,484 --> 00:11:56,936
You cut their heads off.

155
00:11:58,172 --> 00:12:00,196
- So, do I pass your test?
- Yep.

156
00:12:02,465 --> 00:12:03,976
- Now get out of my house.
- Dad!

157
00:12:04,136 --> 00:12:05,674
I don't trust other hunters, Dean.

158
00:12:05,794 --> 00:12:08,064
- Don't want their help.
- Don't want them around my family.

159
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,916
Knock it off, samuel.

160
00:12:10,692 --> 00:12:11,797
He's a hunter.

161
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:14,610
Who passed your little pop quiz,
and now i'm inviting him to dinner.

162
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,422
- You hungry?
- Starving.

163
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:18,115
Good.
I'm deanna.

164
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:20,110
You've met my husband, samuel.

165
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,293
Now wash up.

166
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:24,497
Samuel and... deanna?

167
00:12:26,229 --> 00:12:27,208
Really?

168
00:12:27,728 --> 00:12:29,375
First time in lawrence, dean?

169
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:31,487
Been a while.

170
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:33,360
Things sure have changed...

171
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
I think.

172
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,112
You working a job?

173
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,764
- Yeah, maybe.
- What's that mean?

174
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:44,314
It means I don't trust
other hunters either, samuel.

175
00:12:51,132 --> 00:12:53,360
So, why were you following me and john?

176
00:12:54,728 --> 00:12:57,279
I thought something was
after your -- your boyfriend.

177
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,449
But, um, I don't think that anymore.

178
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,174
John winchester mixing
it up with spirits.

179
00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:04,749
Can you imagine?

180
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:06,827
I saw that.

181
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:10,741
- What?
- That sour-lemon look.

182
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,463
Now, hold on.
John's a really, really nice...

183
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,049
... naive civilian.

184
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:20,719
So, what, would you rather
me be with a guy like this?

185
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,548
What? No, no.

186
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,374
Mary, of course not.
It's just that I --

187
00:13:24,494 --> 00:13:26,142
That's enough, both of you.

188
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:27,800
We have company.

189
00:13:30,422 --> 00:13:32,926
So, what about you, sam?
You, uh, working a job?

190
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:33,858
Might be.

191
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:37,634
He's working a job
on the whitshire farm.

192
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:41,050
Whitshire... why does
that name sound familiar to me?

193
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,171
It's been all over the papers.
Tom whitshire.

194
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:46,036
- Got tangled up in a combine.
- That kind of thing happens.

195
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:48,914
Except why was he on it in the
first place when his crops are all dead?

196
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:52,668
- Demonic omens?
- That's what I got to find out.

197
00:13:53,688 --> 00:13:55,333
What about the rest of the town?

198
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:57,173
Did you find anything on the web?

199
00:13:57,645 --> 00:13:59,983
Of... information
that you have assembled?

200
00:14:01,003 --> 00:14:02,553
Electrical storms, maybe.

201
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,223
The weather service graphs
should be here on friday.

202
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:07,522
By mail?

203
00:14:07,642 --> 00:14:10,186
No, we hired a jetliner
to fly them to us overnight.

204
00:14:13,393 --> 00:14:15,816
You know, it sounds to me like
we might be hunting the same thing.

205
00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:19,069
You know, if we go in there in numbers,
we'll take care of this real quick.

206
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:22,017
What part of "we work alone"
do you not understand, son?

207
00:14:29,705 --> 00:14:32,458
- And I'm here because...
- Family business, mary.

208
00:14:33,517 --> 00:14:34,418
Family.

209
00:14:39,902 --> 00:14:42,542
What, you'd rather be waving
pom-poms at a bunch of dumb jocks?

210
00:14:49,545 --> 00:14:51,024
Uh, where you going?

211
00:14:51,144 --> 00:14:52,866
To do the job, dad.

212
00:15:05,482 --> 00:15:06,482
Father.

213
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:08,285
I see you beat me here.

214
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:10,207
The lord is funny that way.

215
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,082
Beth whitshire...

216
00:15:13,242 --> 00:15:16,621
This is my associate,
our senior senior priest,

217
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:18,646
Father Cheney.

218
00:15:19,734 --> 00:15:23,201
Please accept our deepest condolences
on behalf of the county diocese.

219
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:24,134
Thank you.

220
00:15:24,892 --> 00:15:27,303
Miss whitshire was just telling me
all about tom

221
00:15:27,423 --> 00:15:31,152
and how normal and ordinary things
were on the day before his death.

222
00:15:31,272 --> 00:15:32,272
I see.

223
00:15:32,823 --> 00:15:34,903
So you didn't notice
anything unusual, ma'am?

224
00:15:35,023 --> 00:15:37,940
You mean like my husband's
guts fertilizing the back 40?

225
00:15:41,521 --> 00:15:42,646
Excuse me.

226
00:15:56,066 --> 00:15:58,877
Charlie, would you like to tell
the father here what you just told me?

227
00:16:02,273 --> 00:16:03,609
Dad drank sometimes.

228
00:16:05,774 --> 00:16:07,219
Sometimes he got rough with mom.

229
00:16:07,632 --> 00:16:09,154
And that's when the stranger came?

230
00:16:09,274 --> 00:16:12,146
I just thought he was some
bible-thumper, like you-all.

231
00:16:12,836 --> 00:16:14,393
He showed up about a week ago.

232
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:15,603
Saying what?

233
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,965
Did I want the beatings to stop?

234
00:16:18,085 --> 00:16:20,149
I just thought he was crazy.
I didn't think...

235
00:16:21,727 --> 00:16:23,697
And the next thing I know, dad's dead.

236
00:16:24,731 --> 00:16:25,805
Am I going to jail?

237
00:16:25,925 --> 00:16:27,698
You didn't do this, charlie.

238
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,117
Did the stranger want
something in return?

239
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,215
- He didn't want anything.
- Come on, chuck.

240
00:16:32,335 --> 00:16:34,171
He wasn't just handing out freebies,
was he?

241
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,582
He did say something about coming
a-calling 10 years from now

242
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:40,169
- and maybe he'd want something then.
- Something like what?

243
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:41,801
I don't know, okay?

244
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:44,340
Look, I told you he was nuts.

245
00:16:51,331 --> 00:16:52,363
What do you think?

246
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:55,249
I think he just pimped his soul
to a demon, and he doesn't even know it.

247
00:17:00,595 --> 00:17:02,733
Charlie, do you remember
what the stranger looked like?

248
00:17:03,245 --> 00:17:04,338
Yeah, uh...

249
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,958
He's about 5'10"...

250
00:17:07,381 --> 00:17:08,400
White.

251
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:12,368
- He was kind of normal-looking, really.
- Anything else?

252
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:14,995
- There was one thing.
- What?

253
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:18,498
It's just, the light hit
his eyes in a weird way, and...

254
00:17:19,937 --> 00:17:22,896
- For a moment, I could have sworn --
- What, that they were black?

255
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:24,145
Or red, maybe?

256
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:25,039
No.

257
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,583
They were yellow.

258
00:17:29,762 --> 00:17:30,636
Pale yellow.

259
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:40,371
What do you say we just slow
down and talk this thing through?

260
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:42,680
- There's nothing to talk about.
- Except there's a demon

261
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,275
and none of us has ever heard
of demon with yellow eyes.

262
00:17:45,905 --> 00:17:46,955
Yeah, well, ihave.

263
00:17:47,145 --> 00:17:48,487
This thing killed my family.

264
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:50,783
- Just calm down, son.
- You don't get it, do you?

265
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,581
You are in danger.
We are all in danger.

266
00:17:52,701 --> 00:17:54,388
You need to
get yourself someplace safe.

267
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:56,758
- Not til we know what we deal with.
- Sam's right...

268
00:17:56,878 --> 00:17:59,427
It could be a demon, it could
be a shapeshifter, any number of things.

269
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:01,121
I know what this thing is!

270
00:18:01,773 --> 00:18:04,002
And I'm gonna kill it.
That's all the talking I need to do.

271
00:18:04,162 --> 00:18:05,667
You're gonna kill a demon?
How?

272
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:08,006
There's a hunter named Daniel Elkins.
He lives in colorado.

273
00:18:08,408 --> 00:18:09,550
He has colt's gun.

274
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:11,398
The colt.

275
00:18:11,518 --> 00:18:13,443
Yeah, I heard about the colt.

276
00:18:13,689 --> 00:18:15,514
I used to tell it to
mary as a bedtime story.

277
00:18:15,674 --> 00:18:16,765
Well, it's real.

278
00:18:20,531 --> 00:18:22,130
All right, say that it is.

279
00:18:22,358 --> 00:18:25,107
You got some kind of a crystal ball
telling you where this demon's gonna be?

280
00:18:25,955 --> 00:18:27,383
Yeah, maybe I do.

281
00:18:34,301 --> 00:18:35,868
- What's this?
- It's a list.

282
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,463
Of what?

283
00:18:37,696 --> 00:18:39,842
My dad wrote down anyone he thought
ever came in contact

284
00:18:39,962 --> 00:18:42,416
with the yellow-eyed demon.
Who, where, and when.

285
00:18:42,576 --> 00:18:43,292
Why?

286
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:45,599
'cause the more he could learn
about the son of a bitch,

287
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:47,946
the more he could figure out
why it killed my mom.

288
00:18:51,727 --> 00:18:52,426
Look.

289
00:18:53,964 --> 00:18:55,012
Whitshire farm.

290
00:18:55,172 --> 00:18:56,860
I told you that name sounded familiar.

291
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,702
Whitshire farms --
That was two days ago.

292
00:18:58,822 --> 00:19:00,869
How the hell is that on your dad's list?

293
00:19:04,106 --> 00:19:05,961
My dad could see the future.

294
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:11,525
Look at this -- says he's
gonna hit here tomorrow night.

295
00:19:11,645 --> 00:19:13,322
- Liddy walsh?
- Haleyville.

296
00:19:13,482 --> 00:19:14,839
That's close.

297
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,575
Yeah, it's about 3 miles, but...

298
00:19:23,832 --> 00:19:25,464
I know you guys think I'm crazy.

299
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:28,045
You seem like a really nice kid,
dean, but, yeah, you're crazy.

300
00:19:28,469 --> 00:19:29,718
Yeah, maybe.

301
00:19:30,334 --> 00:19:32,089
But I know where
this bastard's gonna be.

302
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:33,542
And I'm gonna stop it...

303
00:19:34,327 --> 00:19:35,501
Once and for all.

304
00:19:49,204 --> 00:19:50,818
I'm shoving off.

305
00:19:51,796 --> 00:19:53,570
I just wanted to say "bye."

306
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,956
Really?

307
00:19:55,464 --> 00:19:56,397
So soon?

308
00:19:56,517 --> 00:19:58,033
Yeah, I have a job to do.

309
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:01,061
Hey, I wanted to tell you,

310
00:20:01,812 --> 00:20:03,733
you know, for what it's worth, um...

311
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:08,794
It doesn't matter what your dad thinks.
I like that john kid.

312
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:10,379
You do?

313
00:20:10,872 --> 00:20:11,872
Yeah.

314
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,790
Yeah, I think you two are meant to be.

315
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:17,845
- Hell, i'm depending on it.
- What?

316
00:20:18,392 --> 00:20:19,263
Nothing.

317
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:23,195
Can I ask you a question?

318
00:20:24,027 --> 00:20:26,019
What's he like?
John?

319
00:20:27,474 --> 00:20:28,709
Why do you ask?

320
00:20:29,448 --> 00:20:30,399
Just curious.

321
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:33,900
I don't know.

322
00:20:36,392 --> 00:20:37,322
He's sweet...

323
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:39,616
Kind.

324
00:20:40,468 --> 00:20:41,938
Even after the war,

325
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:44,146
after everything,

326
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:46,748
he still believes in
"happily ever after," you know?

327
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:50,127
He's everything a hunterisn't.

328
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,325
No offense.

329
00:20:55,209 --> 00:20:56,445
No, none taken.

330
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:00,637
Can I tell you something?

331
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,634
He's gonna ask me to marry him.

332
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:07,102
Tomorrow, I think.

333
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:10,755
- Yeah?
- Oh, dad's gonna explode.

334
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:13,556
But I don't care.

335
00:21:14,437 --> 00:21:17,117
I'll run away if I have to.
I just...

336
00:21:18,335 --> 00:21:20,574
I love john.
And...

337
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:25,037
And what?

338
00:21:27,974 --> 00:21:29,430
I want to get out.

339
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,316
This job, this...

340
00:21:33,215 --> 00:21:34,215
life.

341
00:21:35,476 --> 00:21:36,584
I hate it.

342
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:42,708
I want a family.

343
00:21:44,922 --> 00:21:46,342
I want to be safe.

344
00:21:51,187 --> 00:21:53,364
You know,
the worst thing I can think of...

345
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:55,266
The very worst thing...

346
00:21:56,364 --> 00:21:59,237
Is for my children to
be raised into this, like I was.

347
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,492
Well, I won't let it happen.

348
00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:07,879
Yeah.

349
00:22:12,647 --> 00:22:13,669
You okay?

350
00:22:15,037 --> 00:22:16,505
Yeah.
No, I'm -- I'm fine.

351
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,692
Hey, m--
Uh, mary...

352
00:22:23,285 --> 00:22:24,733
Can I tell you something?

353
00:22:25,088 --> 00:22:25,847
Sure.

354
00:22:26,436 --> 00:22:28,480
Even if this sounds really weird,

355
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:31,732
will you promise me
that you will remember?

356
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:32,852
Okay.

357
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,905
On november 2, 1983...

358
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,160
... don't get out of bed.

359
00:22:49,197 --> 00:22:51,623
No matter what you
hear or what you see...

360
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:57,524
promise me you won't get out of bed.

361
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:03,218
Okay.

362
00:23:34,224 --> 00:23:36,796
So, what, god's my co-pilot?
Is that it?

363
00:23:40,874 --> 00:23:43,008
Oh, you're a regular chatty cathy.

364
00:23:43,893 --> 00:23:45,095
Tell me something --

365
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:48,013
Sam would have wanted in on this.
Why not bring him back?

366
00:23:49,925 --> 00:23:51,558
You had to do this alone, dean.

367
00:23:54,168 --> 00:23:57,481
And you don't care that he's tearing
up the future looking for me right now?

368
00:23:58,482 --> 00:24:00,358
Sam's not looking for you.

369
00:24:03,354 --> 00:24:06,987
All right, if I do this,
then the family curse breaks, right?

370
00:24:07,811 --> 00:24:11,508
Mom and dad live happily ever after,
and sam and I grow up

371
00:24:12,307 --> 00:24:14,464
playing little league and chasing tail?

372
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,626
You realize if you do alter the future,

373
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:21,254
your father, you, sam, you'll never
become hunters.

374
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:24,716
And all those people you saved,
they'll die.

375
00:24:28,045 --> 00:24:29,137
I realize.

376
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:30,786
And you don't care?

377
00:24:31,234 --> 00:24:32,307
Oh, I care.

378
00:24:33,142 --> 00:24:34,325
I care a lot.

379
00:24:38,107 --> 00:24:39,356
But these are my parents.

380
00:24:39,889 --> 00:24:41,816
I'm not gonna let them die again.

381
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:43,733
I can't.

382
00:24:45,681 --> 00:24:46,987
Not if I can stop it.

383
00:25:10,255 --> 00:25:12,114
Hold it right there, friend.

384
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,599
Drop the gun.
Be on your way.

385
00:25:23,793 --> 00:25:25,068
Can't do it, daniel.

386
00:25:25,837 --> 00:25:26,987
Who the hell are you?

387
00:25:27,332 --> 00:25:28,965
A hunter, just like yourself.

388
00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:31,324
- "Thief" is more like it.
- I need it for a few days.

389
00:25:31,484 --> 00:25:32,735
Not happening, mister.

390
00:25:32,855 --> 00:25:35,521
Look, I have a chance
to save my family's lives.

391
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,290
My family.

392
00:25:37,826 --> 00:25:39,590
But I need this gun to do it.

393
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,830
So if you want to stop me, kill me.

394
00:26:08,044 --> 00:26:10,075
There's some hunters
in lawrence

395
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:11,448
The Campbells.

396
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,154
Never heard of them.

397
00:26:13,274 --> 00:26:14,569
That's where she'll be.

398
00:26:23,073 --> 00:26:24,610
Dean say where he was going?

399
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,360
He said he was gonna kill a demon.

400
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,987
Kill a demon?

401
00:26:28,107 --> 00:26:30,207
- That's impossible.
- Yep.

402
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:32,484
Where?

403
00:26:32,604 --> 00:26:34,422
- Oh, I don't know...
- Over in Haleyville.

404
00:26:35,215 --> 00:26:36,787
Walshes, maybe.

405
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:38,850
Oh, wait --
Not liddy walsh?

406
00:26:39,168 --> 00:26:40,894
Well, yeah, I- I think so.

407
00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:42,613
Dad, she's a friend of mine!

408
00:26:43,298 --> 00:26:44,397
We got to help her.

409
00:26:44,911 --> 00:26:46,851
- What's wrong?
- I'll be in the car.

410
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,300
She wants to hunt,
she doesn't want to hunt.

411
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,816
Is this some female
"time of month" thing?

412
00:26:55,122 --> 00:26:56,122
What?

413
00:26:57,544 --> 00:26:58,756
I'm sorry, liddy.

414
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:00,997
It's metastasized.

415
00:27:01,785 --> 00:27:03,541
- Where?
- His liver, his lungs.

416
00:27:04,044 --> 00:27:05,925
It's time we talked about arrangements.

417
00:27:06,045 --> 00:27:08,174
No, you have to do something, Dr. Brown.

418
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:09,339
There is one way --

419
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,757
A cure, actually.

420
00:27:11,085 --> 00:27:12,342
But I'll need your help.

421
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:14,738
- What do I have to do?
- Nothing.

422
00:27:14,858 --> 00:27:18,554
Just in 10 years, i'm going to
come to you and ask for something then.

423
00:27:19,818 --> 00:27:21,977
- What?
- Nothing you'll miss.

424
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:40,036
Hold that thought.

425
00:27:47,036 --> 00:27:49,087
You son of a bitch.

426
00:27:51,124 --> 00:27:52,497
Well, hello, there.

427
00:27:54,134 --> 00:27:56,136
Where the hell have
they been hiding you?

428
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,309
I like you.
You got a lot of spunk.

429
00:28:13,938 --> 00:28:15,037
You let her go!

430
00:28:15,473 --> 00:28:16,968
Where'd you get that gun?

431
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:35,672
- Mary, what else did he say to you?
- I told you...

432
00:28:35,792 --> 00:28:36,968
Just that he liked me.

433
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,998
What did he mean by that?

434
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:45,886
- Liddy's a strong kid.
- She'll be fine.

435
00:28:46,122 --> 00:28:48,480
- Are you okay?
- No, dad, i'm pretty far from okay.

436
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,640
Can we go?

437
00:28:52,727 --> 00:28:54,992
- Nice job in there.
- I missed the shot.

438
00:28:56,298 --> 00:28:57,812
Take the compliment, son.

439
00:28:58,532 --> 00:29:00,699
I'm saying that I was wrong about you.

440
00:29:04,862 --> 00:29:06,263
We need to talk alone.

441
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:15,743
We have to kill this thing now,
or Mary dies.

442
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:17,410
- What?
- How do you know that?

443
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,260
- I just do, okay?
- When?

444
00:29:19,813 --> 00:29:22,744
Maybe today, probably years from now,
but it's happening. Trust me.

445
00:29:22,864 --> 00:29:25,100
So, what, are you some
kind of a psychic now, too?

446
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,016
No.

447
00:29:31,054 --> 00:29:32,899
All right, listen to me.

448
00:29:35,162 --> 00:29:36,986
Now, this is gonna sound a little...

449
00:29:38,493 --> 00:29:41,306
Actually, it's gonna sound massively,
massively crazy.

450
00:29:41,426 --> 00:29:42,426
Okay.

451
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:45,245
- Mary is my mother.
- Excuse me?

452
00:29:45,405 --> 00:29:46,621
And I am your grandson.

453
00:29:47,505 --> 00:29:50,625
- I know what I'm talking about.
- You want to run that by me again, son?

454
00:29:50,785 --> 00:29:52,585
My real name is dean winchester.

455
00:29:52,964 --> 00:29:54,606
I was born january 24, 1979.

456
00:29:56,834 --> 00:29:59,426
My parents are mary and john winchester.

457
00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:01,621
I don't have to listen to this.

458
00:30:01,796 --> 00:30:04,973
Mary gets killed by
a yellow-eyed demon in 1983.

459
00:30:05,617 --> 00:30:07,517
Now, I think that this,
what happened tonight,

460
00:30:07,678 --> 00:30:10,145
I think this is the moment
that he caught her scent.

461
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:14,073
Now, if we don't catch this thing
now and kill it and it gets away...

462
00:30:14,934 --> 00:30:16,268
Then mary dies.

463
00:30:17,868 --> 00:30:19,164
So I'm asking you...

464
00:30:19,893 --> 00:30:20,893
Please.

465
00:30:28,069 --> 00:30:29,101
Y- you okay?

466
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,892
You promised you'd take me away.

467
00:30:32,741 --> 00:30:33,918
Of course I did.

468
00:30:35,933 --> 00:30:37,116
Do it now.

469
00:30:46,132 --> 00:30:47,744
How did I know about the colt, huh?

470
00:30:47,864 --> 00:30:50,518
How did I know about the yellow-eyed
demon or where it would be?

471
00:30:50,678 --> 00:30:52,520
I'm not making this up, samuel.

472
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,024
Every bone in my body is aching
to put you six feet under, but...

473
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,611
There's something about you --
I can't shake it.

474
00:31:01,424 --> 00:31:04,491
Now, I may be crazier than you,
son, but I believe you.

475
00:31:05,953 --> 00:31:06,867
Thank you.

476
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:09,014
How do we find this bastard?

477
00:31:09,715 --> 00:31:10,997
Right here -- the list.

478
00:31:11,664 --> 00:31:12,989
And with the colt?

479
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:24,260
Let me see it.

480
00:31:30,615 --> 00:31:32,671
Sorry.
I don't let anybody hold it.

481
00:31:33,388 --> 00:31:34,562
I'm your grandfather.

482
00:31:35,915 --> 00:31:36,981
Nothing personal.

483
00:31:37,681 --> 00:31:38,608
Sure it is.

484
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:41,986
Especially when it's
me you're trying to kill.

485
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,209
Future boy, huh?

486
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:09,514
I only know one thing that's got
the juice to swing something like that.

487
00:32:09,823 --> 00:32:12,142
You must have friends in high places.

488
00:32:13,155 --> 00:32:14,549
So, I kill your mommy?

489
00:32:16,335 --> 00:32:19,732
That's why you came all
this way to see little ol'me?

490
00:32:20,388 --> 00:32:21,859
Oh, I came here to kill you.

491
00:32:25,515 --> 00:32:26,622
Wait a minute.

492
00:32:28,582 --> 00:32:30,743
If that slug marries your mommy,
are you --

493
00:32:33,516 --> 00:32:35,415
Are you one of my psychic kids?

494
00:32:40,409 --> 00:32:41,253
No.

495
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:42,826
Not you.

496
00:32:43,685 --> 00:32:44,882
Maybe you got a sis.

497
00:32:47,546 --> 00:32:48,827
Or a bro.

498
00:32:48,947 --> 00:32:50,430
That's terrific.

499
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:53,016
That means it all worked out.

500
00:32:53,565 --> 00:32:55,609
After all, it's why I'm here.

501
00:32:55,729 --> 00:32:58,708
- So that's what this is about...
- These deals you're making.

502
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,895
You don't want these people's souls.

503
00:33:02,015 --> 00:33:02,761
No.

504
00:33:04,486 --> 00:33:05,820
I just want their children.

505
00:33:06,644 --> 00:33:09,741
I'm here to choose the perfect parents,
like your mommy.

506
00:33:10,137 --> 00:33:11,141
Why her?

507
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,022
Why any of them?

508
00:33:13,142 --> 00:33:14,556
Because they're strong.

509
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:17,123
They're pure.
They eat their wheaties.

510
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:20,501
My own little master race.
They're ideal breeders.

511
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:23,957
Oh, get your mind out of the gutter.

512
00:33:24,077 --> 00:33:25,521
No one's breeding with me.

513
00:33:25,828 --> 00:33:26,895
Though Mary...

514
00:33:28,894 --> 00:33:31,902
Man, I'd like to make an exception.

515
00:33:32,022 --> 00:33:33,431
So far, she's my favorite.

516
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,355
So, why make the deals?

517
00:33:41,251 --> 00:33:42,580
I need permission.

518
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,462
I need to be invited into their houses.

519
00:33:44,582 --> 00:33:46,648
I know, I know -- the
red tape will drive you nuts.

520
00:33:46,768 --> 00:33:49,872
But in 10 short years,
it'll all be worth it.

521
00:33:50,441 --> 00:33:52,867
'cause you know what
i'm gonna do to your sibling?

522
00:33:53,027 --> 00:33:55,226
I'm gonna stand over their crib,

523
00:33:55,346 --> 00:33:57,335
and I'm gonna bleed into their mouth.

524
00:33:57,455 --> 00:34:00,460
Demon blood is better than ovaltine,
vitamins, minerals.

525
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,001
It makes you big and strong!

526
00:34:02,677 --> 00:34:03,677
For what?

527
00:34:04,523 --> 00:34:07,267
So they can lead your
discount demon army?

528
00:34:07,834 --> 00:34:10,159
- Is that your big plan?
- Please.

529
00:34:11,995 --> 00:34:15,223
My endgame's a hell of
a lot bigger than that, kid.

530
00:34:15,497 --> 00:34:16,581
Endgame?

531
00:34:16,998 --> 00:34:17,934
What endgame?

532
00:34:18,251 --> 00:34:19,869
Like I'm gonna tell you.

533
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,857
Or those angels sitting
on your shoulder.

534
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:26,585
No.

535
00:34:27,652 --> 00:34:29,237
I'm gonna cover my tracks good.

536
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,286
You can cover whatever
the hell you want.

537
00:34:33,023 --> 00:34:34,492
I'm still gonna kill you.

538
00:34:34,897 --> 00:34:35,897
Right.

539
00:34:36,572 --> 00:34:38,037
Now, that, i'd like to see.

540
00:34:38,891 --> 00:34:40,187
Maybe not today.

541
00:34:41,692 --> 00:34:45,052
But you look into my eyes,
you son of a bitch.

542
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:48,089
'cause I'm the one that kills you.

543
00:34:54,505 --> 00:34:56,222
So, you're gonna save everybody.

544
00:34:56,396 --> 00:34:58,055
Is that right?
Is that it?

545
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:03,312
Well, I'll tell you one
person that you're not gonna save.

546
00:35:03,723 --> 00:35:04,731
Your grandpappy.

547
00:35:08,105 --> 00:35:08,879
No!

548
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:53,362
I guess it's no secret
why I brought you way out here.

549
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:56,273
- John...
- I just...

550
00:35:57,397 --> 00:35:58,910
just let me get through this, okay?

551
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,900
Okay, wait.

552
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:04,707
There's things you
don't know about me, john.

553
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,330
So?

554
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:14,027
I will always love you
for exactly who you are.

555
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:23,100
- What did I tell you?
- Dad!

556
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,473
Sir, just listen!

557
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:26,772
Ow! Dad!

558
00:36:26,892 --> 00:36:27,967
Stay away from her!

559
00:36:28,087 --> 00:36:30,765
- You're hurting me!
- Hey, take it easy!

560
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:32,579
No.

561
00:36:41,828 --> 00:36:42,829
You killed him.

562
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,082
Oh, not just john, sweetie pie.

563
00:36:48,765 --> 00:36:50,118
Mommy and daddy, too.

564
00:36:53,176 --> 00:36:54,472
They're all dead.

565
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,133
No.

566
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:57,718
Yep.'fraid so.

567
00:36:58,372 --> 00:37:01,153
- You're little orphan mary now.
- You son of a bitch!

568
00:37:01,273 --> 00:37:03,724
Oh, sticks and stones
may break my bones.

569
00:37:06,149 --> 00:37:08,261
And they won't bring
your family back either.

570
00:37:08,952 --> 00:37:09,952
I'll kill you.

571
00:37:10,523 --> 00:37:13,021
I swear to god.

572
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:15,085
Oh, let's not get nasty.

573
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,748
Now, look,
we both said some things that we regret.

574
00:37:21,587 --> 00:37:22,816
Let's, uh...

575
00:37:25,437 --> 00:37:27,046
kiss and make up.

576
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:29,917
I'll tell you what --

577
00:37:30,263 --> 00:37:34,248
i'll arrange to have lover
boy here brought back breathing.

578
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:38,551
My parents, too?

579
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:40,585
Nope.

580
00:37:41,146 --> 00:37:42,805
Sorry, doll.
That's not on the table.

581
00:37:43,872 --> 00:37:44,962
Think about it.

582
00:37:45,538 --> 00:37:47,592
You could be done with hunting forever.

583
00:37:47,712 --> 00:37:49,555
The white picket fence,

584
00:37:49,675 --> 00:37:52,315
station wagon, couple of kids.

585
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:56,235
No more monsters or fear.

586
00:37:57,037 --> 00:37:58,362
I'll make sure of it.

587
00:37:58,597 --> 00:37:59,530
What?

588
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,032
And all it costs is my soul?

589
00:38:01,192 --> 00:38:02,843
Oh, no.
You can keep your soul.

590
00:38:02,963 --> 00:38:04,285
I just need permission.

591
00:38:09,586 --> 00:38:10,590
For what?

592
00:38:11,214 --> 00:38:14,843
In 10 year I need to swing by your House
for a little something, that's all.

593
00:38:14,963 --> 00:38:15,922
For... what?

594
00:38:16,082 --> 00:38:16,964
Relax.

595
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,538
As long as I'm not interrupted,

596
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,545
nobody gets hurt.

597
00:38:24,383 --> 00:38:25,348
I promise.

598
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,413
Or you can spend the rest
of your life

599
00:38:35,533 --> 00:38:37,361
desperate and alone.

600
00:38:39,425 --> 00:38:40,529
Mary?

601
00:38:41,223 --> 00:38:42,519
It's a good deal.

602
00:38:45,132 --> 00:38:46,570
So, what do you say?

603
00:39:03,581 --> 00:39:04,220
No!

604
00:40:18,857 --> 00:40:20,305
I couldn't stop any of it.

605
00:40:23,077 --> 00:40:24,497
She still made the deal.

606
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,238
She still died in the nursery,
didn't she?

607
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,436
Don't be too hard on yourself.

608
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,632
You couldn't have stopped it.

609
00:40:39,922 --> 00:40:40,922
What?

610
00:40:42,269 --> 00:40:44,219
Destiny can't be changed, dean.

611
00:40:47,643 --> 00:40:50,159
All roads lead to the same destination.

612
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:52,023
Then why'd you send me back?

613
00:40:52,143 --> 00:40:53,152
For the truth.

614
00:40:53,645 --> 00:40:55,039
Now you know everythingwedo.

615
00:40:55,509 --> 00:40:57,374
What the hell are you talking about?

616
00:41:07,562 --> 00:41:08,469
Where's sam?

617
00:41:09,894 --> 00:41:11,653
We know what azazel did to your brother.

618
00:41:11,773 --> 00:41:13,899
What we don't know is why --

619
00:41:14,019 --> 00:41:15,629
what his endgame is.

620
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,895
He went to great lengths
to cover that up.

621
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:21,649
- Where's sam?
- 425 waterman.

622
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:29,573
Your brother is headed
down a dangerous road, dean.

623
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,951
And we're not sure where it leads.

624
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:33,619
So stop it.

625
00:41:35,362 --> 00:41:36,330
Or we will.
