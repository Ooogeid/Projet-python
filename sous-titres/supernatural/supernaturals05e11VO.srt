1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,254
- Hell hounds!
- Yeah, Dean... Your favorite.

2
00:00:11,014 --> 00:00:13,087
I can't fight, I can't walk.

3
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:14,650
But I can do something.

4
00:00:14,775 --> 00:00:17,220
We've got everything we need
to build a bomb.

5
00:00:21,432 --> 00:00:23,239
- What are we doing?
- Hunting a ghost.

6
00:00:23,364 --> 00:00:25,310
You know who does that?
Crazy people!

7
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:26,650
We are insane!

8
00:00:31,205 --> 00:00:32,615
Tomorrow we hunt the devil.

9
00:00:32,784 --> 00:00:34,583
This is our last night on earth.

10
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,703
Take this thing to Lucifer
and empty it into his face.

11
00:00:42,587 --> 00:00:46,087
- You know I'd never hurt you.
- You listen to me, you son of a bitch.

12
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,012
I'm gonna kill you myself.

13
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:51,874
- I'm going to rip your heart out!
- That's good, Sam.

14
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:54,512
You keep fanning that fire
in your belly.

15
00:00:54,802 --> 00:00:56,138
All that pent-up rage.

16
00:00:56,566 --> 00:00:57,966
I'm gonna need it.

17
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,411
The nurses tell me
that you're not taking your medication.

18
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:20,372
You want to tell me why?

19
00:01:22,101 --> 00:01:23,101
Susan?

20
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:26,919
The pills make me sleepy,
but I can't...

21
00:01:28,431 --> 00:01:30,081
If I sleep, it'll come.

22
00:01:31,148 --> 00:01:32,633
You mean the monster.

23
00:01:33,188 --> 00:01:36,429
- Now, we have talked about this.
- But it killed Annie.

24
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,974
Susan, you're schizophrenic.

25
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:43,179
Your mind plays tricks on you.

26
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:47,999
You get confused.
Sometimes you see things.

27
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:50,288
I know what I am.

28
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:53,988
Like I can see my dead son
standing right behind you.

29
00:01:54,392 --> 00:01:55,823
I know he's not real.

30
00:01:58,036 --> 00:01:59,336
But the monster,

31
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:00,751
it is real.

32
00:02:05,478 --> 00:02:06,940
Annie was your roommate,

33
00:02:07,065 --> 00:02:10,165
and what happened to her was painful
for all of us.

34
00:02:11,755 --> 00:02:14,862
Perhaps it's easier for you
to conjure up a monster

35
00:02:14,987 --> 00:02:18,640
than to face how tragic
her suicide really was.

36
00:02:20,005 --> 00:02:21,655
I can hear it at night.

37
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:24,477
In the walls. Please!

38
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:27,795
You have to believe me.

39
00:02:29,764 --> 00:02:32,486
There is no such thing as monsters.

40
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,085
Oh, my God!

41
00:03:22,705 --> 00:03:23,705
Help me!

42
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,350
Help me!!

43
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,541
They're starting early tonight.

44
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:32,797
Hurry!

45
00:03:38,263 --> 00:03:39,468
It's coming!

46
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:41,467
Help me!

47
00:04:03,757 --> 00:04:04,907
= 511 =

48
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:08,331
= Supernatural Team =

49
00:04:23,968 --> 00:04:27,018
You were referred to me
by a Dr. Babar in Chicago.

50
00:04:27,631 --> 00:04:28,781
That's right.

51
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:32,938
Isn't there a children's book
about an elephant named Babar?

52
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:35,071
I don't know.

53
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:36,916
I don't have any elephant books.

54
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,580
Look, doctor, I think that...

55
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:41,639
The doc was in over his head
with this one

56
00:04:41,764 --> 00:04:43,364
'cause my brother's...

57
00:04:45,549 --> 00:04:46,951
Okay, fine. Thank you.

58
00:04:47,514 --> 00:04:49,064
That's not necessary.

59
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:53,444
Why don't you tell me
how you're feeling, Alex?

60
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,291
I'm fine.

61
00:04:57,752 --> 00:05:00,637
I mean, okay,
a little depressed, I guess.

62
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,968
All right. Any idea why?

63
00:05:03,488 --> 00:05:05,846
Probably because
I started the apocalypse.

64
00:05:07,726 --> 00:05:09,926
- The apocalypse?
- That's right.

65
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,021
And you think you started it.

66
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:17,708
I mean...

67
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:20,107
I killed this demon, Lilith.

68
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:22,279
And I accidentally freed Lucifer
from hell.

69
00:05:22,524 --> 00:05:25,199
So, now he's topside,
and we're trying to stop him.

70
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:30,553
- Who is?
- Me. And him.

71
00:05:30,861 --> 00:05:33,267
And this one angel.

72
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,710
You mean like an angel
on your shoulder?

73
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,004
No, his name's Castiel.
He wears a trench coat.

74
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,550
See, doc?

75
00:05:40,953 --> 00:05:43,467
The kid's been beating himself up
about this for months.

76
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:46,751
The apocalypse wasn't his fault.

77
00:05:48,272 --> 00:05:49,672
- It's not?
- No.

78
00:05:50,593 --> 00:05:53,436
There was this other demon, Ruby.
She got him addicted to demon blood.

79
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,479
Near the end,
he was chugging the stuff.

80
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,710
My brother's not evil.

81
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:01,887
He was just...

82
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,238
High.

83
00:06:07,778 --> 00:06:10,658
Could you fix him up so we can get back
to traveling around the country

84
00:06:10,783 --> 00:06:12,333
and hunting monsters?

85
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:18,348
Erma...

86
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:20,647
Cancel my lunch.

87
00:06:22,636 --> 00:06:26,640
Dr. Fuller would like to keep you both
under observation for a couple of days.

88
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,650
- Both? Me too?
- Yes, sugar.

89
00:06:28,775 --> 00:06:30,806
The doctor thinks
that would be best.

90
00:06:34,584 --> 00:06:37,133
All right. I'm just gonna give you
a little checkup.

91
00:06:37,258 --> 00:06:39,314
Look, let's get one thing straight.

92
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,483
I've seen Cuckoo's nest,
so don't try any of that

93
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:44,194
soul-crushing authoritarian crap
on me.

94
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:46,958
Okey-dokey.

95
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:52,536
Go ahead and take down your pants.

96
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,413
Wait!

97
00:06:55,256 --> 00:06:56,713
What? What for?

98
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:17,161
- How was your silkwood shower?
- Okay.

99
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,411
Yeah. Good. Good...

100
00:07:20,388 --> 00:07:23,442
- Good water pressure. Did the nurse...
- She was very thorough.

101
00:07:24,503 --> 00:07:25,553
Good, good.

102
00:07:33,983 --> 00:07:35,963
I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

103
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,652
It's the least we could do.

104
00:07:37,777 --> 00:07:40,459
Martin saved dad's ass many times.
He's a great hunter.

105
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:42,419
Was. Until Albuquerque.

106
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:45,839
Besides, I just figure
it's best we keep busy.

107
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:47,529
Better than what?

108
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:50,436
Nothing.

109
00:07:52,664 --> 00:07:53,814
Okay, look...

110
00:07:55,948 --> 00:07:57,351
You have been worrying me.

111
00:07:58,062 --> 00:08:00,802
Come on, Sam, stop.
Ours being in the looney bin

112
00:08:00,927 --> 00:08:02,940
doesn't give you the right
to head-shrink me.

113
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:05,651
Ellen and Jo dying,
it was a freakin' tragedy, okay?

114
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,641
- But I'm not gonna wallow in it.
- You always do this.

115
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:10,658
You can't just keep this crap in.

116
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:13,266
Watch me.

117
00:08:14,572 --> 00:08:15,672
There he is.

118
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,078
You boys got big.

119
00:08:31,858 --> 00:08:34,721
- You look good.
- Thanks. You do, too, Martin.

120
00:08:39,203 --> 00:08:40,903
Well, thanks for coming.

121
00:08:44,192 --> 00:08:46,302
In the old days,
I could've taken care of this

122
00:08:46,427 --> 00:08:48,610
with both hands tied behind my back.

123
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:50,866
Well, now...

124
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,083
- What do you think we're hunting?
- I don't know yet.

125
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,710
A ghost, demon, monster.

126
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:01,924
Animal, vegetable, mineral.

127
00:09:03,551 --> 00:09:05,970
Hospital's had five deaths
in the last four months.

128
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:09,245
Doctors keep calling it suicides,
but they're wrong.

129
00:09:10,212 --> 00:09:11,614
So you've seen this thing?

130
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:15,417
Has anyone seen this thing?

131
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,740
Well, a couple of patients have...

132
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:21,602
... had glimpses
but that's not a lot to go on.

133
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:25,063
- Are they reliable?
- Sure. Why wouldn't they be?

134
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:32,856
Gee, I don't know.

135
00:09:32,981 --> 00:09:35,365
I know you boys think
I'm a bag of loose screws.

136
00:09:35,894 --> 00:09:39,189
Well, you wouldn't be wrong.
But I wouldn't have called you

137
00:09:39,314 --> 00:09:41,107
unless there was something here.

138
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:42,748
I can feel it in my gut.

139
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:47,347
We believe you.

140
00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:50,012
Have you checked any of the bodies,
found signs of an attack?

141
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,460
I don't...

142
00:09:56,034 --> 00:09:57,793
I don't go around dead b-bo...

143
00:09:57,918 --> 00:09:59,318
B- bodies anymore.

144
00:10:00,757 --> 00:10:04,157
Alex, Eddie. Well, I'm glad to see
you're making friends.

145
00:10:04,596 --> 00:10:07,546
Why don't you and Mr. Creaser
join us for group?

146
00:10:08,152 --> 00:10:09,566
Please, right this way.

147
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,576
Actually, I'm going to be putting you
in the afternoon group.

148
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:21,289
What? Why?

149
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:22,849
To be frank,

150
00:10:23,365 --> 00:10:26,625
the relationship with your brother
seems dangerously codependent.

151
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:30,175
I think a little time apart
will do you both good.

152
00:10:36,032 --> 00:10:38,679
All right, so,
who would like to start us off?

153
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Anyone else?

154
00:10:47,186 --> 00:10:48,436
All right, Ted.

155
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:49,561
Calm down.

156
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:51,596
I am calm.

157
00:10:52,823 --> 00:10:54,273
And I'd very calmly

158
00:10:54,398 --> 00:10:56,597
like to talk about the monster
that's hunting us.

159
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:59,185
Ted, we're not going to have
that discussion again.

160
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,701
It's not good for group.

161
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,583
I agree.

162
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:06,290
You know what else
isn't good for group?

163
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,751
- A monster eating all our faces off!
- All right, fine. Thank you.

164
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,004
- Now, anyone else...
- I saw it!

165
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,755
- When it killed Susan!
- I did too.

166
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,815
- It had lobster claws.
- It didn't!

167
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,790
- It was an alien, like on X-files.
- Stop it!

168
00:11:19,022 --> 00:11:20,872
Stop helping! Listen to me!

169
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:23,609
- We're all dead!
- That's enough!

170
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,337
There is no monster.

171
00:11:33,155 --> 00:11:36,055
Now, Ted,
do you need me to call the orderlies?

172
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,322
Or can you behave?

173
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,490
Behave.

174
00:11:47,756 --> 00:11:48,756
King me!

175
00:11:49,595 --> 00:11:50,595
Eddie?

176
00:11:51,881 --> 00:11:54,519
I'm Dr. Erica Cartwright.
I've been assigned your case.

177
00:11:54,644 --> 00:11:55,994
You're my shrink?

178
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,342
Lucky me.

179
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,832
And you're my paranoid schizophrenic

180
00:12:00,957 --> 00:12:03,889
with narcissistic personality disorder
and religious psychosis.

181
00:12:05,006 --> 00:12:06,006
Lucky me.

182
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:09,571
Can we talk?

183
00:12:12,405 --> 00:12:14,438
I've actually got
some questions for you.

184
00:12:14,563 --> 00:12:16,680
What a coincidence.
I've got some for you, too.

185
00:12:16,805 --> 00:12:19,341
Well, then, quid pro quo, Clarice.

186
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:23,022
Okay, Hannibal, I'll go first.

187
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,388
- How many hours a night do you sleep?
- Three or four every couple of nights.

188
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,593
What can you tell me
about the suicides in here?

189
00:12:29,718 --> 00:12:32,618
- They were tragic.
- Noticed anything strange?

190
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,217
You know, like, I don't know,
black smoke, sulfur?

191
00:12:35,342 --> 00:12:37,166
No. Why?
What's that supposed to mean?

192
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,913
Demon signs. I hunt demons, monsters,
that kind of thing.

193
00:12:41,038 --> 00:12:44,153
- How many drinks do you have a week?
- Well, I got to sleep sometime, so...

194
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:47,478
What's seven days, times...
Somewhere in the mid-50s.

195
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,396
Ever feel any cold spots or get a chill
walking through the hospital?

196
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:55,565
- Not that I can remember. If I had?
- It means there's a ghost around.

197
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,987
When was the last time
you were in a long-term relationship?

198
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,241
- Define "long-term."
- More than two months.

199
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:05,725
Never.

200
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:10,176
- The patients see anything weird?
- In here?

201
00:13:11,115 --> 00:13:12,265
All the time.

202
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,730
Let's talk about your father.

203
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:35,583
- You okay?
- I just got "thraped."

204
00:13:35,891 --> 00:13:37,357
So, no, I am not okay.

205
00:13:37,823 --> 00:13:39,359
Tell me you found something.

206
00:13:39,781 --> 00:13:42,539
A guy says he saw a creature.
We should talk to him.

207
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:44,002
Back here in an hour?

208
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:46,564
The sooner we take care of this
the sooner we can get gone.

209
00:13:46,689 --> 00:13:48,449
This place gives me the creeps.

210
00:14:03,873 --> 00:14:04,873
I'm Wendy.

211
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:14,102
Maybe this place isn't so bad.

212
00:14:14,638 --> 00:14:16,906
Dude... You cannot hit that.

213
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:20,306
Oh, so torn.

214
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:28,595
About time.

215
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,893
Nurses are on their rounds.
We got 15, 20 minutes. Where's this guy?

216
00:14:32,018 --> 00:14:33,018
Room 306.

217
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,800
- Hurry up! Come on! Hurry up!
- Back off, Dean!

218
00:14:54,104 --> 00:14:54,614


219
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,419
- I found something.
- What?

220
00:15:21,544 --> 00:15:22,594
Right here.

221
00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:24,233
Give me a hand.

222
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,439
This hole goes all the way
through to his brain.

223
00:15:45,564 --> 00:15:47,064
What does that mean?

224
00:15:49,337 --> 00:15:50,587
Let's find out.

225
00:15:51,543 --> 00:15:52,543
Seriously?

226
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:54,679
You might wanna keep watch.

227
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,732
- Dude!
- Look... His brain's been sucked dry.

228
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,900
That's fascinating.
Somebody's coming.

229
00:16:42,854 --> 00:16:44,252
What are you doing here?

230
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:53,644
Pudding!

231
00:16:55,826 --> 00:16:57,349
All right. Come on, you two.

232
00:17:01,163 --> 00:17:02,263
Crazy works.

233
00:17:13,354 --> 00:17:14,866
Are those original gacys?

234
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,744
- I painted those.
- Back on point, please.

235
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,999
- Whatever this thing is,
- Good.

236
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,916
it slurpees your brain,
sucks you dry.

237
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,524
Then it makes the deaths
look like suicides.

238
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,578
Any ideas?

239
00:17:32,815 --> 00:17:33,815
A bad one.

240
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,562
What is it?

241
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:39,557
Well, I bet you a chicken dinner
it's what we're up against.

242
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,725
A wraith.

243
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:44,479
They crack open skulls
and feed on brain juice.

244
00:17:44,968 --> 00:17:47,568
- You ever tangle with one before?
- Never.

245
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:50,428
- Never wanted to, neither.
- So how do we kill it?

246
00:17:51,332 --> 00:17:54,221
Silver. You so much as touch a wraith
with the stuff,

247
00:17:54,346 --> 00:17:55,824
and the skin will crackle.

248
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:59,661
Now, that's the good news.
The bad news is they can pass as humans.

249
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,124
It could be any Peter, Paul, or Mary
in the joint.

250
00:18:04,672 --> 00:18:06,584
Fantastic. So how do we find it?

251
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
A mirror.

252
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:12,799
Lore says a wraith
will show its true form in a mirror.

253
00:18:13,268 --> 00:18:16,243
We just got to spot-check
every patient and every staff member.

254
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:20,682
But, I mean,
what's it doing in a mental hospital?

255
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,810
A nuthouse...
It's a perfect captive victim pool.

256
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,236
Sure.

257
00:18:25,828 --> 00:18:28,720
Who's gonna believe a patient
when they say they saw a monster?

258
00:18:28,845 --> 00:18:30,606
It's the perfect hunting ground.

259
00:18:43,364 --> 00:18:44,614
What's up, doc?

260
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,190
You tell me.

261
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:48,858
Hunting.

262
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:50,925
A wraith, actually.

263
00:18:51,512 --> 00:18:52,793
Could be anybody.

264
00:18:52,918 --> 00:18:54,668
So, I could be a monster?

265
00:18:56,573 --> 00:18:57,923
No. You're clean.

266
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:02,108
- Why you?
- Why me what?

267
00:19:02,696 --> 00:19:05,727
Why do you have to hunt monsters?
Why not let someone else do it?

268
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,303
I can't find anybody else that dumb.

269
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:16,047
It's my job.

270
00:19:16,306 --> 00:19:18,433
Somebody's got to save
people's asses.

271
00:19:19,005 --> 00:19:20,255
Yours included.

272
00:19:20,523 --> 00:19:23,973
So, is there a quota?
How many people do you have to save?

273
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,730
- All of 'em.
- All of them?

274
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:30,835
- You think you have to save everyone?
- Whole wide world of sports.

275
00:19:31,048 --> 00:19:32,048
How?

276
00:19:35,473 --> 00:19:37,550
Whatever you've got,
I've heard weirder.

277
00:19:40,275 --> 00:19:42,375
It's the end of the world, okay?

278
00:19:43,136 --> 00:19:45,336
I mean,
it's the damn biblical apocalypse.

279
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:48,391
And if I don't stop it
and save everyone,

280
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:50,666
then no one will, and we all die.

281
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:52,577
That's horrible.

282
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,068
Tell me about it.

283
00:19:55,449 --> 00:19:57,749
I mean, apocalypse or no apocalypse,

284
00:19:58,188 --> 00:20:01,032
monsters or not,
that's a crushing weight.

285
00:20:02,546 --> 00:20:05,346
To feel like six billion lives
depend on you.

286
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:07,609
God.

287
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,864
How do you get up in the morning?

288
00:20:15,593 --> 00:20:16,793
Good question.

289
00:20:18,172 --> 00:20:19,322
Hello, Eddie.

290
00:20:20,397 --> 00:20:21,397
Doc.

291
00:20:35,387 --> 00:20:36,387
All right.

292
00:20:36,512 --> 00:20:38,826
I had to raid
three nurses' stations to get these.

293
00:20:38,951 --> 00:20:41,281
They're only silver-plated,
but they should work.

294
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,293
Not today, sweetheart.
Come on. Keep walking.

295
00:20:58,448 --> 00:20:59,698
I want him now.

296
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:01,818
He's larger.

297
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:10,685
You've had worse.

298
00:21:14,134 --> 00:21:17,734
Fuller is on call tonight,
so we'll hit him after lights out.

299
00:21:18,258 --> 00:21:20,108
- All three of us.
- What?

300
00:21:20,675 --> 00:21:23,823
Martin, we got to get past the security,
past the orderlies,

301
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,007
and then cut the boss man's throat,
okay?

302
00:21:26,132 --> 00:21:28,244
It's gonna suck
but we could use the backup.

303
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,512
No, I can't.

304
00:21:30,225 --> 00:21:33,275
- I can't.
- We know what happened in Albuquerque.

305
00:21:35,566 --> 00:21:37,462
You don't know the half of it.

306
00:21:38,374 --> 00:21:41,132
God...
I used to be just like you two.

307
00:21:41,355 --> 00:21:43,301
I used to think I was invincible.

308
00:21:43,538 --> 00:21:44,588
And then...

309
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:48,647
- Well, I found out I'm not.
- Martin, you are still a hunter.

310
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:49,872
No, I'm not!

311
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:51,191
I'm useless!

312
00:21:51,316 --> 00:21:53,811
Why do you think I checked myself
into the hotel California?

313
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,820
I'd give anything to help you boys.
I would.

314
00:21:57,652 --> 00:21:59,229
But I can't.

315
00:22:00,058 --> 00:22:01,508
I'm sorry, I can't.

316
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:18,378
He's still in the building.
Take the west wing, I'll take the east.

317
00:23:27,213 --> 00:23:28,239
Look at his arm!

318
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,007
The cut's not burning!

319
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,129
It's not him! It's not him.

320
00:23:46,768 --> 00:23:47,719


321
00:23:55,661 --> 00:23:56,661
You okay?

322
00:23:59,352 --> 00:24:00,998
No, I'm not okay.

323
00:24:04,303 --> 00:24:05,681
I am...

324
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:07,779
Awesome!

325
00:24:08,587 --> 00:24:10,053
They give you something?

326
00:24:10,543 --> 00:24:12,624
They gave me everything.

327
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,830
It's spectacu... lacular.

328
00:24:19,621 --> 00:24:21,621
You always were a happy drunk.

329
00:24:28,595 --> 00:24:31,095
- The doctor wasn't a wraith.
- I know.

330
00:24:32,801 --> 00:24:35,932
I don't understand, I saw it
in the mirror. It wasn't human.

331
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,240
Or you're seeing things.

332
00:24:38,893 --> 00:24:40,770
Maybe you're going crazy.

333
00:24:40,965 --> 00:24:43,535
- I'm not crazy.
- Well, come on!

334
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,310
You've been at least...

335
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,944
Half crazy for a long time.

336
00:24:48,294 --> 00:24:51,093
Since you got back from hell...
Or since before that, even.

337
00:24:51,218 --> 00:24:54,033
And we're in a...
We're in a mental hospital.

338
00:24:54,992 --> 00:24:56,792
Maybe you finally cracked.

339
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:00,665
You know, maybe...
Maybe now you are really,

340
00:25:02,073 --> 00:25:03,654
for-real crazy.

341
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:06,245
I made a mistake. That's all.

342
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:07,904
I'll find the thing.

343
00:25:09,204 --> 00:25:10,424
I know, I know.

344
00:25:10,892 --> 00:25:11,892
It's okay.

345
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:13,193
Look at me.

346
00:25:14,357 --> 00:25:15,457
It's okay...

347
00:25:16,658 --> 00:25:18,358
Cause you're my brother.

348
00:25:19,939 --> 00:25:21,227
And I still love ya.

349
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,523
- You missed our session today.
- I'm a little busy.

350
00:25:36,648 --> 00:25:38,858
- Still hunting that wraith?
- People are dying.

351
00:25:38,983 --> 00:25:40,683
People die all the time.

352
00:25:41,156 --> 00:25:43,727
Look, just let me do my job,
maybe save your life?

353
00:25:43,852 --> 00:25:47,545
- Not my life that I'm worried about.
- Oh, my go... I am fine, okay?

354
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:48,713
I'm fine!

355
00:25:50,406 --> 00:25:52,800
Come on.
Even you don't believe that.

356
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:55,266
All this pressure
you're putting yourself under,

357
00:25:55,391 --> 00:25:57,294
all this guilt... It's killing you.

358
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,680
You can't save everybody.

359
00:25:59,979 --> 00:26:00,979
You can't.

360
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:04,437
Hell, these days,
you can't save anybody, Dean.

361
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,480
- What'd you say?
- The truth, Dean.

362
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,149
You got Ellen and Jo killed.

363
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,234
You shot Lucifer,
but you couldn't gank him.

364
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,440
You couldn't stop Sam
from killing Lilith,

365
00:26:12,565 --> 00:26:14,071
and you broke the first seal.

366
00:26:14,603 --> 00:26:16,279
All you do is fail.

367
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,016
Did you really think that you,
Dean Winchester,

368
00:26:19,141 --> 00:26:22,121
with a GED and a give-'em-hell attitude,
were gonna beat the devil?

369
00:26:22,889 --> 00:26:23,889
Please.

370
00:26:24,387 --> 00:26:27,460
The world is gonna burn,
and there is nothing you can do.

371
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:28,787
Who are you?

372
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,229
How do you know that stuff?

373
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:33,886
- Settle down.
- Tell me!

374
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,816
I said settle down.

375
00:26:41,048 --> 00:26:42,048
Are you...

376
00:26:44,132 --> 00:26:45,182
Who is she?

377
00:26:46,392 --> 00:26:47,392
Who?

378
00:26:47,663 --> 00:26:50,691
- What are you, blind? Her!
- Pal, there's nobody there.

379
00:26:58,937 --> 00:27:00,087
I'm not real.

380
00:27:00,807 --> 00:27:02,257
I'm in your head...

381
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:05,381
Cause you are going crazy.

382
00:27:14,139 --> 00:27:15,639
Just leave me alone.

383
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:58,843
You asked to see me?

384
00:28:00,065 --> 00:28:01,065
Thanks.

385
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:05,982
I wanted to apologize.

386
00:28:06,107 --> 00:28:08,519
I feel horrible
about what I did to you.

387
00:28:08,925 --> 00:28:10,730
I thought you were a monster.

388
00:28:11,873 --> 00:28:12,973
I know that.

389
00:28:13,786 --> 00:28:15,336
The question is, why?

390
00:28:21,698 --> 00:28:23,098
It doesn't matter.

391
00:28:23,887 --> 00:28:26,720
Because after what happened last night,
I had a...

392
00:28:27,846 --> 00:28:29,246
Moment of clarity.

393
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:30,958
I realized

394
00:28:32,263 --> 00:28:34,463
there's no such thing as monsters.

395
00:28:38,986 --> 00:28:39,986
Well,

396
00:28:40,581 --> 00:28:42,581
I'm glad to hear you say that.

397
00:28:43,177 --> 00:28:44,327
But honestly?

398
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,391
Monsters are the least
of your problems.

399
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:51,187
People can learn
to live with delusions,

400
00:28:51,525 --> 00:28:53,375
but the anger I saw in you.

401
00:28:54,753 --> 00:28:58,003
You hurt those two men,
and you were going to kill me.

402
00:28:59,314 --> 00:29:02,214
The look in your eyes
when you came after me...

403
00:29:03,722 --> 00:29:05,910
It was like
you were barely even human.

404
00:29:09,843 --> 00:29:11,393
Like a man possessed.

405
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:17,797
I know.

406
00:29:21,911 --> 00:29:22,911
Please...

407
00:29:25,402 --> 00:29:26,402
Just...

408
00:29:28,329 --> 00:29:30,529
Could you give me a second chance?

409
00:29:33,723 --> 00:29:35,189
This isn't a prison.

410
00:29:35,614 --> 00:29:38,776
You'll be allowed to go to the day room.
Under supervision.

411
00:29:38,993 --> 00:29:39,993
Thank you.

412
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:45,155
But if there is one more outburst,

413
00:29:45,563 --> 00:29:48,099
I will transfer you to a facility

414
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:50,491
that is equipped
to handle violent patients.

415
00:29:50,616 --> 00:29:51,866
And believe me,

416
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:55,501
they will be far,
far less forgiving.

417
00:30:05,352 --> 00:30:06,502
What's wrong?

418
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,250
It's not the demon blood, Sam.

419
00:30:11,282 --> 00:30:12,982
- It never was.
- What?

420
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,020
The problem was you.

421
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:17,721
It was always you...

422
00:30:17,846 --> 00:30:20,568
The lies, your arrogance,

423
00:30:20,934 --> 00:30:22,884
that black spot on your soul.

424
00:30:23,252 --> 00:30:25,156
We're all gonna die because of you.

425
00:30:25,497 --> 00:30:27,283
- It's all your fault!
- You killed us!

426
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,785
- Pathetic freak!
- You evil son of a bitch!

427
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:46,559
Leave me alone!

428
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:49,797
Stop it! Leave me alone!

429
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:52,090
Leave me alone! I didn't do it!

430
00:30:52,215 --> 00:30:54,861
Get off of me!
Leave me alone!

431
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,356
Leave me alone!

432
00:30:59,678 --> 00:31:01,028
What's happening?

433
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:03,838
What's happening?

434
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,459
Martin, martin, it's me!
It's Dean!

435
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,002
I'm sorry.

436
00:31:23,074 --> 00:31:24,774
You look like hell, boy.

437
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,426
- I feel like it, too.
- Where's Sam?

438
00:31:27,941 --> 00:31:30,804
Lockdown.
He went crazy, thank God.

439
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,322
- What?
- I'm going crazy, too.

440
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:37,393
I'm seeing things, I'm hearing things.
We both are.

441
00:31:38,921 --> 00:31:41,273
- Crazy's the clue.
- What do you mean?

442
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:47,264
- Dean?
- Crazy's the clue.

443
00:31:47,389 --> 00:31:48,822
You said that! What?

444
00:31:49,137 --> 00:31:52,451
The things me and Sam have done,
the stuff we've seen...

445
00:31:52,876 --> 00:31:54,773
We're gonna end up going guano
eventually,

446
00:31:54,898 --> 00:31:57,331
probably end up
like a couple of drooling nutbags.

447
00:31:59,338 --> 00:32:00,388
No offense.

448
00:32:01,148 --> 00:32:02,198
None taken.

449
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,134
But me and him freaking out
on the same day?

450
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:07,132
I mean, it's got to be the...

451
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:09,051
- The monster.
- What? Where?

452
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:10,886
No, there's nothing there.

453
00:32:11,674 --> 00:32:12,674
Look...

454
00:32:15,635 --> 00:32:17,893
What if this thing
doesn't just feed on the insane?

455
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,105
What if it makes people insane?

456
00:32:23,017 --> 00:32:24,775
Is that possible?
Does that seem real?

457
00:32:27,126 --> 00:32:28,126
Well,

458
00:32:28,251 --> 00:32:31,251
I'm not the most reliable source
on what is real,

459
00:32:31,376 --> 00:32:33,450
but it sounds... Makes sense.

460
00:32:35,248 --> 00:32:37,298
Okay, so... so we got infected.

461
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,583
something shot us up with crazy.
You know, something...

462
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:44,549
Maybe...

463
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:48,490
- Maybe it was the ghost of my dad.
- No.

464
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:50,884
Focus on the wraith.

465
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,167
- Focus!
- Right, the wraith. The wraith.

466
00:32:53,292 --> 00:32:55,492
Okay, so the wraith, the wraith...

467
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,870
It poisoned us.

468
00:32:57,973 --> 00:33:00,373
Maybe with venom, you know,
by touch.

469
00:33:01,383 --> 00:33:02,686
Or venom,

470
00:33:03,622 --> 00:33:04,622
or saliva.

471
00:33:06,963 --> 00:33:07,963
Wendy.

472
00:33:09,191 --> 00:33:11,891
Wendy! Wendy slobbered
all over me and Sam!

473
00:33:12,016 --> 00:33:13,866
That's how we got infected!

474
00:33:34,238 --> 00:33:35,929
I can't step on the cracks.

475
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:50,525
Is this real?

476
00:34:01,277 --> 00:34:02,427
It is, sugar.

477
00:34:03,524 --> 00:34:04,774
It's very real.

478
00:34:07,136 --> 00:34:07,946


479
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,539
She's still alive!

480
00:34:45,588 --> 00:34:48,422
There's two patients in Wendy's room.
They attacked me.

481
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,500
Dean? Can you hear me?

482
00:34:59,504 --> 00:35:01,890
You've got to get out there
and kill that thing.

483
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,435
I'll take care of her.

484
00:35:07,155 --> 00:35:09,940
- I can't.
- You have to. You have no choice, son.

485
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:16,871
Dean, run! Run!

486
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,222
Let me go!

487
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,853
You are far too angry
to be out there in the real world.

488
00:35:51,238 --> 00:35:53,138
- You!
- Of course it's me.

489
00:35:54,515 --> 00:35:58,065
I got to say, you hunters
don't exactly live up to your rep.

490
00:35:58,347 --> 00:36:01,200
I mean, Martin's a wreck.
He's harmless.

491
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:05,412
And you and your brother come in here,
talking about killing monsters?

492
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:07,875
Kind of made you easy to spot.

493
00:36:08,631 --> 00:36:10,581
Then all it took was a touch.

494
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,197
And you were mine.

495
00:36:16,848 --> 00:36:18,248
I love it in here.

496
00:36:20,117 --> 00:36:22,638
This place is my own personal
five-star restaurant.

497
00:36:27,503 --> 00:36:28,753
Crazy brains...

498
00:36:29,068 --> 00:36:33,065
They get soaked in dopamine
and adrenaline

499
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,479
and just all sorts of hormones
and chemicals

500
00:36:35,604 --> 00:36:37,886
that make them delicious.

501
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:42,689
And the crazier they are,
the better they taste.

502
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,368
You did this to me!

503
00:36:46,257 --> 00:36:48,247
Well... I helped.

504
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:51,166
But that rage?
No, no, no, no. That's all you.

505
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,701
I don't make crazy.

506
00:36:52,826 --> 00:36:55,226
I just crank up
what's already there.

507
00:36:55,844 --> 00:36:58,549
You build your own hell.
But I give you the legos.

508
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,534
And when you're ripe...

509
00:37:03,474 --> 00:37:05,924
I make all of your problems
disappear.

510
00:37:09,949 --> 00:37:11,228
You get away from him!

511
00:37:12,442 --> 00:37:14,773
Do you think
this is gonna end well for you?

512
00:37:19,531 --> 00:37:21,953
But I'm crazy, so what the hell.

513
00:38:25,043 --> 00:38:26,143
Still crazy?

514
00:38:29,352 --> 00:38:30,682
Nomore than usual.

515
00:38:32,141 --> 00:38:33,472
We gotta get outta here.

516
00:38:39,073 --> 00:38:39,816


517
00:38:48,506 --> 00:38:51,656
Well, looks like Tom Cruise was right.
Shrinks suck.

518
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:53,890
What?

519
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,090
Sam, you okay?

520
00:38:58,757 --> 00:39:00,128
- The wraith...
- What?

521
00:39:00,891 --> 00:39:04,160
- She was right.
- No, she wasn't. She's dead, okay?

522
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:06,343
Let's hit the road.
I need a drink. Or 12.

523
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,561
Most of the time I can hide it.

524
00:39:09,982 --> 00:39:11,223
But I am angry.

525
00:39:11,495 --> 00:39:13,058
I'm mad at everything.

526
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:16,770
I used to be mad at you and dad,
then Lilith, now it's Lucifer.

527
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,606
And I make excuses.
I blame Ruby or the demon blood.

528
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,234
But it's not their fault.
It's not them. It's me.

529
00:39:23,118 --> 00:39:24,368
It's inside me.

530
00:39:24,931 --> 00:39:25,981
I am mad...

531
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:28,307
All the time!

532
00:39:29,473 --> 00:39:30,784
And I don't know why.

533
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:34,375
Stop it.

534
00:39:37,068 --> 00:39:38,518
So what if you are?

535
00:39:39,307 --> 00:39:41,653
What are you gonna do,
take a leave of absence?

536
00:39:42,056 --> 00:39:44,256
You gonna say yes to Lucifer?
What?

537
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,466
- No, of course not, I...
- Exactly.

538
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:52,139
That's exactly what you're gonna do.
Take all that crap, and bury it.

539
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:54,957
Forget about it!
That's how we keep going.

540
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:57,789
That's how we don't end up
like Martin!

541
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,524
You with me?

542
00:40:04,466 --> 00:40:06,516
Come on, man.
Are you with me?

543
00:40:09,709 --> 00:40:10,859
I'm with you.

544
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,368
Good.

545
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,098
Let's get out of here.
