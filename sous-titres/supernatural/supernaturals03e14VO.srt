00:01:42,429 --> 00:01:43,322
Hello?

2
00:01:43,357 --> 00:01:44,273
<i>Ben?</i>

3
00:01:44,298 --> 00:01:45,479
Linda...

4
00:01:45,514 --> 00:01:46,886
<i>I had to talk to you.</i>

5
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:48,300
You can't keep calling here.

6
00:01:48,335 --> 00:01:50,304
<i>I know. I know. Just...</i>

7
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:52,253
<i>just tell me you thought about it.
Please...</i>

8
00:01:52,288 --> 00:01:53,701
There's nothing to think about.

9
00:01:53,736 --> 00:01:55,126
<i>Don't say that.</i>

10
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,780
I can't.

11
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:58,836
You know I can't. My wife...

12
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,565
<i>I'm begging you. Come to me.</i>

13
00:02:01,596 --> 00:02:03,517
<i>Come to me, Ben.</i>

14
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:04,972
No.

15
00:02:16,906 --> 00:02:18,970
Linda, please...

16
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,890
Please, just leave me alone.

17
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:22,473
<i>I'm not gonna stop.</i>

18
00:02:22,507 --> 00:02:24,462
<i>I miss you, Ben.</i>

19
00:02:24,505 --> 00:02:27,662
<i>We could be happy.
We could be happy together.</i>

20
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:28,921
This is...

21
00:02:28,927 --> 00:02:30,412
This is crazy!

22
00:02:30,457 --> 00:02:31,733
<i>I love you.</i>

23
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:33,012
<i>Forever.</i>

24
00:02:33,048 --> 00:02:34,943
<i>Don't you love me?</i>

25
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,432
You know I do.

26
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:39,740
More than anything.

27
00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:46,840
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:47,198 --> 00:02:48,473
<i>Ben, wait...</i>

29
00:03:40,547 --> 00:03:41,910
Okay, Linda.

30
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:45,341
You win.

31
00:03:51,556 --> 00:03:52,990
I'm coming.

3x14

35
00:04:04,968 --> 00:04:06,091
Yeah.

36
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:08,392
I've got it. Okay. Bye.

37
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:11,113
So?

38
00:04:11,737 --> 00:04:14,633
- So the Professor doesn't know a crap.
- Shocking.

39
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:16,442
Pack your panties, Sammy.
We're hitting the road.

40
00:04:16,477 --> 00:04:17,520
What? What's up?

41
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:18,743
That was Bobby.

42
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:20,663
Some banker guy blew his head off

43
00:04:20,698 --> 00:04:22,881
in Ohio.
They think there's a spirit involved.

44
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:24,693
So you two were talking a case?

45
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,023
No we were uh, we were actually talking
about our feelings.

46
00:04:27,455 --> 00:04:30,101
And then our favorite boy bands.
Yeah, we were talking a case.

47
00:04:30,147 --> 00:04:32,343
- So, a spirit? What?
- Yeah, well, the banker was complaining

48
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:35,201
about some electrical problems
at his pad for, like, a week,

49
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:38,772
phones going haywire,
computer's flipping on and off... Huh?

50
00:04:40,568 --> 00:04:42,071
This isn't ringing a bell?

51
00:04:42,845 --> 00:04:46,333
Well, sure, yeah. But Dean, we're on a case.

52
00:04:46,366 --> 00:04:48,731
- Whose?
- Your's.

53
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:50,103
Right. Yeah.

54
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:51,912
- Could have fooled me.
- What the hell else

55
00:04:51,955 --> 00:04:54,033
have we been doing lately
other than trying to break your deal?

56
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:55,751
Chasing our tails, that's what.

57
00:04:57,195 --> 00:05:00,173
Sam, we've talked to every professor,
witch, soothsayer,

58
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,310
and two-bit carny act in the lower 48.
Nobody knows squat.

59
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:06,391
And we can't find Bella,
we cannot find the colt.

60
00:05:06,435 --> 00:05:08,312
So until we actually find something,

61
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:09,950
I'd like to do my job.

62
00:05:10,465 --> 00:05:12,450
- Well, there's one thing we haven't tried yet.
- No, Sam.

63
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:14,761
- Dean, we should summon Ruby.
- I'm not gonna have this chat again.

64
00:05:14,795 --> 00:05:16,683
- She says she knows how to save you.
- She can't.

65
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:18,261
- Oh, really? You know that for sure?
- I do.

66
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:20,460
- How?
- Because she told me, okay?

67
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:25,013
- What?
- She told me.

68
00:05:25,878 --> 00:05:29,403
Flat out that she couldn't save me.
Nobody can.

69
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:35,650
And you just somehow neglected
to mention this to me?

70
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:38,460
Well, you know, I really don't care what
that bitch thinks, and neither should you. So...

71
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:40,030
So what? Now
you're keeping secrets from me, Dean?

72
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:42,202
You really wanna talk about
who's keeping secrets from who?

73
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:50,362
Now, where are you going?

74
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:52,113
I guess I'm going to Ohio.

75
00:06:05,955 --> 00:06:07,533
I found him

76
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,171
there.

77
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:12,802
Why don't you just tell us
everything you saw, Mrs. Waters?

78
00:06:13,436 --> 00:06:17,520
- You mean besides my dead husband?
- Wait... just everything else

79
00:06:17,556 --> 00:06:19,480
you saw. Please.

80
00:06:21,586 --> 00:06:22,911
There was uh...

81
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:25,543
blood everywhere.

82
00:06:26,507 --> 00:06:28,162
The phone was ripped from the wall,

83
00:06:28,225 --> 00:06:30,973
his favorite scotch on the desk.
What else could you possibly wanna know?

84
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,612
- Why was the phone ripped from the wall?
- I don't know.

85
00:06:33,615 --> 00:06:35,293
You mind if I take a look?

86
00:06:37,517 --> 00:06:40,110
I already went over all this
with the other detectives.

87
00:06:40,148 --> 00:06:41,960
We'll be out of your hair in no time,
M'am.

88
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:49,773
M'am, what time did your husband die?

89
00:06:49,807 --> 00:06:51,751
Sometime after eleven.

90
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,380
What about strange phonecalls?

91
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,140
Received any those lately?

92
00:07:01,178 --> 00:07:02,960
Weird interference, static,
anything like that?

93
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:04,043
No.

94
00:07:05,345 --> 00:07:06,622
No.

95
00:07:07,498 --> 00:07:10,061
Mrs. Waters, withholding information
from the police

96
00:07:10,105 --> 00:07:11,503
is a capital offense.

97
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,250
In some parts of the world, I'm sure.

98
00:07:20,175 --> 00:07:22,313
A couple of weeks ago,

99
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,350
- there was this...
- This what?

100
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:29,501
I woke up one morning,
I heard Ben in his study.

101
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:32,451
- I thought he was talking to a woman.
- What makes you think that?

102
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:34,130
Because he kept calling her Linda.

103
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,121
The thing is...

104
00:07:36,835 --> 00:07:39,430
I picked up the other line, and,

105
00:07:39,476 --> 00:07:42,551
nobody was there.
Ben was talking to nobody.

106
00:07:42,637 --> 00:07:45,272
- There was nothing?
- Just static.

107
00:07:46,518 --> 00:07:48,593
Did you ever speak to Ben
about this phonecall?

108
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:50,711
No, I should have. But no.

109
00:07:50,787 --> 00:07:53,261
- Did he ever say who Linda was?
- What difference does it make?!

110
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:55,052
There was no one on the other hand!

111
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:02,520
Linda's a babe.

112
00:08:02,555 --> 00:08:04,051
Or was.

113
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:06,081
- You found her?
- Yeah, Linda Bateman.

114
00:08:06,116 --> 00:08:08,332
She met Ben Meyers
in highschool sweethearts.

115
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:10,790
- So, what happened?
- A driver hit her head on,

116
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:13,111
- Ben walked away.
- So, what then?

117
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:15,912
- Dead flame calls to chat?
- You would think.

118
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,962
But Linda was cremated.

119
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:19,790
So what if she's still floating around?

120
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:25,000
- You got me.
- About that caller I.D.?

121
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:26,741
Turns out it's a phone number.

122
00:08:26,785 --> 00:08:29,963
- It's no phone number I've ever seen.
- Yeah, because it's about a century old.

123
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:31,731
From back when phones had cranks.

124
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:33,672
So why use that number to reach out
and toss someone?

125
00:08:33,715 --> 00:08:36,142
You got me there too. But,
either way, we should run a trace on it.

126
00:08:36,177 --> 00:08:38,583
Well, how the hell we'e gonna trace
a number that's a hundred years old?

127
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:41,101
We don't get too many folks from H.Q.
down here.

128
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,992
Yeah, that's why the main office mentionned
that there would be a lunch.

129
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:46,671
Well, I'm sure we can arrange something.

130
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:49,173
The man you gentlemen wanna speak to
is right this...

131
00:08:50,866 --> 00:08:55,721
I know. Sorry. Got something of
a hygiene issue down here, if you ask me.

132
00:08:58,738 --> 00:08:59,893
Stewie!

133
00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:03,543
What did I tell you
about keeping this place clean?

134
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:08,370
Stewie Meyers, Mister Campbell,
Mister Remy.

135
00:09:08,408 --> 00:09:10,052
I don't know how it's got here.

136
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:13,252
From Head Quarters.

137
00:09:15,016 --> 00:09:17,032
You give these gentlement
whatever they need.

138
00:09:18,315 --> 00:09:20,062
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

139
00:09:20,107 --> 00:09:22,370
So, can I help you?

140
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:26,433
- Is that bustyasianbeauties.com?
- No.

141
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:30,693
- Maybe.
- Word to the wise...

142
00:09:30,725 --> 00:09:33,013
Platinum membership worth every penny.
Right?

143
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:35,620
We're here to trace a number.

144
00:09:37,071 --> 00:09:38,916
- Where did you get this?
- Of caller I.D.

145
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,755
- Oh, no. That's impossible.
- It hasn't been used in a few years. We know.

146
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:44,147
A few years? It's pre-historic.
Trust me.

147
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:47,330
- Nobody is using this number anymore.
- Sure. Could you run it anyway?

148
00:09:47,335 --> 00:09:50,431
Sure. Why don't I just rearrange
my whole life first?

149
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:53,681
Listen, Stewie,

150
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:57,801
you've got like six kinds of
employee code violations down here,

151
00:09:57,836 --> 00:10:01,421
not to mention this sickening porn
clogging up your hard drive.

152
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:04,713
When my partner says to run the number,

153
00:10:04,748 --> 00:10:06,590
I'd suggest you run the number.

154
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,023
- Holy crap!
- What?

155
00:10:24,055 --> 00:10:26,692
I can't tell you
where the number comes from.

156
00:10:27,548 --> 00:10:29,932
But I can tell you
where it's been going.

157
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:32,560
What do you mean?

158
00:10:35,046 --> 00:10:37,590
It's ten different houses
in the past two weeks.

159
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:40,231
All got calls from the same number.

160
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,162
So, are we done here?

161
00:10:52,206 --> 00:10:54,640
'Cause I was sort of busy.

162
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:56,933
Right.

163
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:26,381
Yeah?

164
00:11:26,427 --> 00:11:28,740
Hello, Sir.
I'm with the phone company.

165
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,290
Uh, we didn't call the phone company.

166
00:11:31,326 --> 00:11:33,100
Oh, no, Sir. See, we're calling you.

167
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:35,511
See, we've got a lot of complaints
from the neighbourhood lately.

168
00:11:35,538 --> 00:11:38,162
- Complaints?
- Yes, Sir. Uh... droppecalls,

169
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:42,483
static, maybe even strange voices
on the other hand of the line.

170
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:44,192
No, we've never had any of that here.

171
00:11:44,228 --> 00:11:45,461
Nothing?

172
00:11:45,508 --> 00:11:48,193
- No.
- Okay, uh, great. Just

173
00:11:48,228 --> 00:11:50,570
- thought we'd check. Thanks.
- No problem.

174
00:11:50,607 --> 00:11:52,151
Ok, let's go.

175
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:53,780
Come on, Simon.

176
00:12:07,075 --> 00:12:09,341
No way you work for the phone company.

177
00:12:11,187 --> 00:12:13,213
- Sure, I do.
- Since when does a phone guy

178
00:12:13,255 --> 00:12:14,883
drive a rental or

179
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:16,630
wear a cheap suit?

180
00:12:19,945 --> 00:12:21,763
Yeah? Well,

181
00:12:21,796 --> 00:12:24,142
maybe we're both keeping secrets.

182
00:12:26,548 --> 00:12:28,821
Why did you ask my dad if we heard
strange voices on the phone?

183
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:30,630
- Why? Did you hear something?
- No.

184
00:12:30,678 --> 00:12:32,112
My mistake.
Thought maybe you did.

185
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:33,923
Well, I didn't, okay?

186
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:36,890
Sorry to bother you.

187
00:12:43,857 --> 00:12:45,183
Because, you know...

188
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:48,242
if you did,

189
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,601
then I would have told you

190
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:53,372
that I've been right
where you're standing right now.

191
00:12:55,097 --> 00:12:56,640
Hearing things,

192
00:12:56,686 --> 00:12:59,542
even seeing things
that couldn't be explained.

193
00:13:01,056 --> 00:13:04,012
Maybe I would have been able
to help out a little bit.

194
00:13:06,855 --> 00:13:08,391
Anyways.

195
00:13:10,305 --> 00:13:11,563
Hey, wait.

196
00:13:13,565 --> 00:13:14,881
Maybe...

197
00:13:17,018 --> 00:13:19,533
Maybe I've been talking on the phone...

198
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,580
with...

199
00:13:21,616 --> 00:13:23,472
with my mum.

200
00:13:25,068 --> 00:13:27,642
- Well, that's not so strange.
- She's dead.

201
00:13:28,246 --> 00:13:30,383
Like three years now dead.

202
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:32,463
How often does she call you?

203
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,732
A few times.

204
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:37,013
It started a week ago.

205
00:13:38,105 --> 00:13:40,392
I thought I was, like, crazy or something.

206
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:44,200
Well, I can tell you one thing for sure,

207
00:13:44,238 --> 00:13:46,452
and you're gonna have
to go with me on this, okay?

208
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:48,723
You're not crazy.

209
00:13:53,545 --> 00:13:55,931
- Yeah?
- Dude, stiffs are calling people all over town.

210
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:58,241
- Yeah. Tell me about it.
<i>- I just talked to an 84 years grandmother</i></i>

211
00:13:58,276 --> 00:14:00,240
who's having phone sex
with her husband...

212
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:01,592
<i>who died in Korea.</i>

213
00:14:01,638 --> 00:14:04,270
Completely rocked my understanding
of the word "necrophilia".

214
00:14:05,237 --> 00:14:07,152
<i>So, what the hell's going on here, Dean?</i>

215
00:14:08,076 --> 00:14:09,541
Beats me, but we better find out soon.

216
00:14:09,577 --> 00:14:11,340
This place is turning into spook central.

217
00:14:11,387 --> 00:14:12,111
<i>Yeah.</i>

218
00:14:12,146 --> 00:14:14,071
- All right, I'll call you later.
- Yep.

219
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:19,632
Yeah, what?

220
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,451
- Sam?
<i>- Dean?</i></i>

221
00:14:24,977 --> 00:14:26,480
<i>Dean, is that you?</i>

222
00:14:27,186 --> 00:14:28,540
Dad?

223
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:32,823
I mean... Dad?

224
00:14:34,058 --> 00:14:35,972
You really think it was dad?

225
00:14:36,305 --> 00:14:37,671
I don't know. Maybe.

226
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:40,801
Well, what did he sound like?

227
00:14:42,205 --> 00:14:43,471
Like Oprah.

228
00:14:43,486 --> 00:14:45,011
It was dad. He sounded like dad.

229
00:14:45,045 --> 00:14:46,640
- What do you think?
- What did he say?

230
00:14:47,307 --> 00:14:48,421
My name.

231
00:14:48,506 --> 00:14:49,592
That's it?

232
00:14:49,607 --> 00:14:51,422
Yeah, the call dropped out.

233
00:14:55,006 --> 00:14:56,761
Why would not he call
in the first place, Dean?

234
00:14:56,808 --> 00:14:59,300
I don't know, man. Why are ghosts
calling anybody in this town?

235
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:03,091
But I mean, other people are hearing
from their loved ones.

236
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:05,270
Why can't we?
It's at least a possibility, right?

237
00:15:08,505 --> 00:15:10,171
Yeah, I guess.

238
00:15:12,405 --> 00:15:13,773
Okay, so what...

239
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,992
what if it really is dad?

240
00:15:20,508 --> 00:15:22,233
What happens if he calls back?

241
00:15:22,508 --> 00:15:23,842
What do you mean?

242
00:15:25,505 --> 00:15:26,750
What do I say?

243
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:28,851
"Hello"?

244
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:30,043
"Hello"?

245
00:15:30,705 --> 00:15:32,722
That's what you come back with?
"Hello"?

246
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,131
"Hello"...

247
00:15:54,346 --> 00:15:55,482
Find anything?

248
00:15:55,507 --> 00:15:59,153
After three hours,
I have found no reason

249
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:02,563
why anything supernatural
would be going on here.

250
00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:04,471
Wow, you know,
you'd think a Stanford education

251
00:16:04,515 --> 00:16:06,491
and a high-school hookup rate of 0.0

252
00:16:06,538 --> 00:16:08,163
would produce better results than that.

253
00:16:08,197 --> 00:16:09,383
Hilarious.

254
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,393
Sam, you're just looking
in the wrong places, pal.

255
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:13,080
And what are the right places, Dean?

256
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,532
Motel pamphlet rack.

257
00:16:17,005 --> 00:16:19,871
Milan, Ohio, birthplace of Thomas Edison.

258
00:16:19,905 --> 00:16:21,121
Yeah, right. So what?

259
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:22,563
Keep reading.

260
00:16:31,008 --> 00:16:32,381
You're kidding.

261
00:16:33,406 --> 00:16:34,901
And we're walking.

262
00:16:35,508 --> 00:16:40,050
And here we have one of the museum's
most unique and treasured possessions,

263
00:16:40,096 --> 00:16:42,730
Thomas Edison's "spirit phone".

264
00:16:42,775 --> 00:16:44,521
Did you know that Mr. Edison,

265
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:46,940
while being one of
America's most beloved inventors,

266
00:16:46,978 --> 00:16:49,682
was also a devout "occultist"?

267
00:16:50,508 --> 00:16:52,101
What's with the quotey fingers?

268
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:54,973
He spent years working on this,
his final invention,

269
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:57,063
which he was convinced could be used to

270
00:16:57,106 --> 00:16:59,232
"communicate" with the "dead".

271
00:16:59,277 --> 00:17:00,791
Pretty spooky, huh?

272
00:17:01,008 --> 00:17:04,180
And we're walking.
We are walking.

273
00:17:05,408 --> 00:17:08,602
And we are not touching that.
And we are walking.

274
00:17:10,506 --> 00:17:11,713
Anything?

275
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:13,701
Nothing.

276
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:16,522
What do you think?

277
00:17:17,295 --> 00:17:18,543
Honestly?

278
00:17:18,608 --> 00:17:20,820
It kind of looks like
an old pile of junk to me.

279
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:23,352
It's not even plugged in.

280
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:25,601
- Maybe it doesn't work like that.
- Okay.

281
00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:28,041
Maybe it's like a radio tower,
you know,

282
00:17:28,087 --> 00:17:29,762
broadcasting the dead all over town.

283
00:17:29,795 --> 00:17:31,491
- Could be.
- Well, you know,

284
00:17:31,536 --> 00:17:33,100
the caller I.D.'s 100 years old, right?

285
00:17:33,157 --> 00:17:34,410
Right around the time this thing was built.

286
00:17:34,516 --> 00:17:36,270
Yeah, but why would it
all of a sudden start working now?

287
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:37,422
I don't know.

288
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:41,081
But as long as the moldy are calling
the freshes around here,

289
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:42,462
it's the best reason we got.

290
00:17:42,507 --> 00:17:43,752
Yeah, maybe.

291
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:46,992
So maybe it really is dad.

292
00:18:05,007 --> 00:18:06,000
Dad?

293
00:18:06,048 --> 00:18:07,271
<i>Dean.</i>

294
00:18:07,306 --> 00:18:08,540
Is it really you?

295
00:18:08,606 --> 00:18:09,671
<i>It's me.</i>

296
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,112
How can I be sure?

297
00:18:13,147 --> 00:18:14,242
<i>You can't.</i>

298
00:18:14,816 --> 00:18:17,052
<i>Dean, how could you do it?</i>

299
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:18,212
Do what?

300
00:18:18,738 --> 00:18:20,121
<i>Sell your soul.</i>

301
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,273
I was looking after Sammy
like you told me to.

302
00:18:22,305 --> 00:18:24,683
<i>I never wanted this. Never.</i>

303
00:18:24,706 --> 00:18:27,193
<i>You're my boy. I love you.</i>

304
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,772
<i>I can't watch you go to hell, Dean.</i>

305
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:29,991
I'm sorry.

306
00:18:29,997 --> 00:18:32,060
I don't know how to stop it.

307
00:18:32,106 --> 00:18:34,603
<i>Because if you break the deal,
Sam dies, right?</i>

308
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,770
- What?
<i>- Well, I know a way out...</i></i>

309
00:18:36,807 --> 00:18:38,060
<i>- for both of you.</i>
- How?</i>

310
00:18:38,107 --> 00:18:40,952
<i>The demon who holds your contract,
he's here.</i>

311
00:18:41,368 --> 00:18:42,472
<i>Now.</i>

312
00:20:47,405 --> 00:20:48,531
What's up?

313
00:20:49,346 --> 00:20:50,613
Girl Lanie...

314
00:20:50,657 --> 00:20:52,962
Her mom's ghost spooked her out
pretty bad last night.

315
00:20:53,008 --> 00:20:54,882
- That sucks.
- Yeah, it does.

316
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:57,163
- What are you doing?
- I think dad's right.

317
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:59,141
I think the demon is here.

318
00:21:00,616 --> 00:21:01,721
Check it out.

319
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:07,992
What is this? Weather reports?

320
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:09,750
Omens, demonic omens,

321
00:21:09,795 --> 00:21:12,421
electrical storms everywhere we've been
for the past two weeks.

322
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,481
I-I don't remember any lightning storms.

323
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:18,450
Well, I don't remember you studying
meteorology as a kid, either.

324
00:21:18,505 --> 00:21:20,691
But I'm telling you,
that bastard's been tailing me,

325
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,200
wearing some poor dude's meat.

326
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:26,243
And it's following you because...?

327
00:21:27,106 --> 00:21:28,730
I guess I'm big game, you know?

328
00:21:28,777 --> 00:21:30,662
My ass is too sweet to let out of sight.

329
00:21:31,617 --> 00:21:33,001
Okay, sure.

330
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:36,442
Don't get too excited, Sammy.

331
00:21:36,446 --> 00:21:37,872
You might pull something.

332
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:41,213
Dean, look, I want to believe this, man.
I really do.

333
00:21:41,245 --> 00:21:42,280
Then believe it!

334
00:21:42,825 --> 00:21:44,471
I mean, if we get this sucker,

335
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,382
- it's miller time.
- Yeah, that's another thing.

336
00:21:46,427 --> 00:21:48,652
Dad rattles off an exorcism
that can kill a demon...

337
00:21:48,706 --> 00:21:51,113
I mean, not just send it
back to hell, but kill it?

338
00:21:51,155 --> 00:21:52,203
I checked it out.

339
00:21:52,908 --> 00:21:54,633
This is heavy-duty dark ages.

340
00:21:55,205 --> 00:21:56,543
15th century.

341
00:21:57,007 --> 00:21:58,970
Yeah, I checked on it, too, Dean.

342
00:21:59,605 --> 00:22:00,910
And so did Bobby.

343
00:22:03,107 --> 00:22:04,292
Okay. And?

344
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:07,583
Look,
it definitely is an exorcism, okay?

345
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,802
There's just no evidence
that it can kill a demon.

346
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:12,521
- No evidence it can't.
- Dean, come on.

347
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:15,151
Hey, as far as I know, the only one of us
that's actually been to hell

348
00:22:15,198 --> 00:22:16,353
is dad, okay?

349
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:17,943
Think maybe he picked up
a couple of tricks down there...

350
00:22:18,025 --> 00:22:21,263
- Like which exorcisms work?
- Maybe it does, okay? Look, I hope it does, too,

351
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,212
- but we just got to be sure.
- Why aren't we sure?

352
00:22:23,277 --> 00:22:25,810
Because I don't know
what's going on around here, Dean.

353
00:22:25,908 --> 00:22:27,913
I mean,
some guy blows his brains out,

354
00:22:28,007 --> 00:22:29,912
a little girl is scared out of her wits.

355
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:32,723
Wow, man! A couple of civvies
are freaked out by some ghosts.

356
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:33,820
News flash, Sam...

357
00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:36,331
People are supposed
to be freaked out by ghosts!

358
00:22:41,407 --> 00:22:42,702
Dad tell you where to find the demon?

359
00:22:42,748 --> 00:22:43,991
I'm waiting on the call!

360
00:22:47,307 --> 00:22:48,842
I told Lanie I'd stop by.

361
00:22:51,005 --> 00:22:54,022
Oh, good, yeah.
No, you go hang out with jailbait.

362
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:56,003
Just watch out for Chris Hansen.

363
00:22:56,047 --> 00:22:58,270
Meanwhile, I'll be here, you know,
getting ready to

364
00:22:58,316 --> 00:22:59,933
save my life.

365
00:23:03,505 --> 00:23:05,492
You are unbelievable, you know that?

366
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:09,033
I mean, for months we've been trying
to break this demon deal.

367
00:23:09,065 --> 00:23:10,761
Now dad's about to give us
the freakin' address,

368
00:23:10,795 --> 00:23:12,183
and you can't accept it?!

369
00:23:12,507 --> 00:23:14,461
The man is dead, and
you're still butting heads with the guy!

370
00:23:14,546 --> 00:23:16,120
- That is not what this is about.
- Then what is it?!

371
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,782
The fact is,
we got no hard proof here, Dean.

372
00:23:18,905 --> 00:23:21,913
After everything, you're still just
going on blind faith!

373
00:23:21,975 --> 00:23:24,783
Yeah, well, maybe! You know,
maybe that's all I got, okay?!

374
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:30,832
Please.

375
00:23:32,075 --> 00:23:36,053
Just please don't go anywhere
until I get back, okay, Dean?

376
00:23:36,106 --> 00:23:37,192
Please.

377
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,390
Have you told your father
about any of this?

378
00:24:02,435 --> 00:24:03,873
And bother him at work?

379
00:24:04,366 --> 00:24:05,630
No.

380
00:24:05,707 --> 00:24:08,283
He wouldn't believe me anyway.
He'd just chuck me into therapy.

381
00:24:08,307 --> 00:24:09,793
So what did your mother say?

382
00:24:10,525 --> 00:24:12,741
That she wanted to see me.

383
00:24:12,777 --> 00:24:15,241
So, at first, I thought I was supposed
to go to the cemetery.

384
00:24:15,308 --> 00:24:17,373
- Did you?
- Nothing happened.

385
00:24:20,506 --> 00:24:23,442
But then she started asking me
to do other things.

386
00:24:23,506 --> 00:24:25,012
What sort of things?

387
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,382
Bad things.

388
00:24:47,506 --> 00:24:50,073
Hello? Simon Greenfield speaking.

389
00:24:51,065 --> 00:24:52,562
Hi, mommy.

390
00:24:52,608 --> 00:24:55,470
Yeah, I want to see you.
Where are you?

391
00:25:04,507 --> 00:25:06,062
- Dad?
<i>- Dean.</i></i>

392
00:25:06,108 --> 00:25:07,100
Where's the demon?

393
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,042
Lanie, please.

394
00:25:09,698 --> 00:25:12,013
Tell me what happened. It's very important.

395
00:25:12,506 --> 00:25:15,563
Mom told me
to go to dad's medicine cabinet.

396
00:25:15,605 --> 00:25:16,761
And?

397
00:25:17,007 --> 00:25:20,630
Take his sleeping pills...
Take all his sleeping pills!

398
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,301
She wanted you to kill yourself?

399
00:25:26,087 --> 00:25:28,623
Why would my mom want me to do that?

400
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:30,771
I don't know.

401
00:25:31,045 --> 00:25:33,841
I mean,
just so I could come to her?

402
00:25:35,596 --> 00:25:36,851
What'd you say?

403
00:25:36,888 --> 00:25:38,621
She wanted me to come to her.

404
00:25:38,657 --> 00:25:40,870
No, no, no, no, no.
How did she say it exactly?

405
00:25:40,895 --> 00:25:44,240
"Come to me", like, a million times.

406
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:49,341
Lanie,

407
00:25:49,737 --> 00:25:51,441
that's not your mother.

408
00:26:19,058 --> 00:26:20,530
All right, listen to me.

409
00:26:20,565 --> 00:26:22,172
Don't answer the phone.
Don't use the computer.

410
00:26:22,186 --> 00:26:24,471
Don't do anything unless I say to,
all right?

411
00:26:28,436 --> 00:26:29,560
Where's Simon?

412
00:26:46,005 --> 00:26:47,071
Hello?

413
00:27:26,295 --> 00:27:28,010
- Dean, it's not dad.
<i>- What is it?</i></i>

414
00:27:28,085 --> 00:27:29,821
- A crocotta.
<i>- Is that a sandwich?</i></i>

415
00:27:29,846 --> 00:27:32,792
Some kind of scavenger...
Mimics loved ones, whispers "come to me",

416
00:27:32,815 --> 00:27:35,321
and loses you in the dark
and swallows your soul.

417
00:27:35,408 --> 00:27:38,020
<i>Crocotta... Right.
Damn, that makes sense.</i>

418
00:27:38,088 --> 00:27:39,672
Dean, look. I'm sorry, man. I know...

419
00:27:39,717 --> 00:27:41,491
<i>- Hey, don't these things live in filth?</i>
- Yeah.</i>

420
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:43,483
<i>Sam, the flies at the phone company.</i>

421
00:28:23,525 --> 00:28:26,140
<i>This is Herman Munster.
Leave a message.</i>

422
00:28:26,186 --> 00:28:29,231
Dean, I'm in the parking lot.
He's here. Hurry.

423
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:39,371
Whoa, what the hell?!

424
00:28:39,415 --> 00:28:41,422
- I know what you are.
- Wait, mister, please.

425
00:28:41,456 --> 00:28:44,491
- And I know how to kill you.
- Okay, wait, wait.

426
00:28:44,627 --> 00:28:47,680
If we're overcharging you
for the call-waiting or something, I...

427
00:28:47,717 --> 00:28:49,852
I can fix that. I'm your friend.

428
00:28:51,017 --> 00:28:53,271
Just... Just don't kill me.

429
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,751
Don't kill me, please!

430
00:28:59,295 --> 00:29:00,233
Yeah!

431
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:03,941
That's what happens when you mess
with the phone company,

432
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:05,381
dillweed!

433
00:29:07,598 --> 00:29:09,143
Thank you, Clark.

434
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:12,441
Forget about it.

435
00:29:13,465 --> 00:29:14,721
Clark?

436
00:29:23,168 --> 00:29:25,242
I'm... I'm sorry, Clark.

437
00:29:25,565 --> 00:29:27,311
I'm sorry for whatever I did to you.

438
00:29:27,407 --> 00:29:29,691
- I'm sorry. Please.
- Wait!

439
00:29:29,736 --> 00:29:30,880
Wait.

440
00:29:31,315 --> 00:29:32,490
Don't do it.

441
00:29:32,535 --> 00:29:33,820
You're awake.

442
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:36,661
You're not a killer, Clark. No!

443
00:29:38,168 --> 00:29:39,010
There's a...

444
00:29:39,018 --> 00:29:41,232
There's a good man inside of you.
I know it.

445
00:29:42,536 --> 00:29:44,083
What do you think, Sammy?

446
00:29:44,585 --> 00:29:46,382
Am I a good man?

447
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:47,952
Just let him go.

448
00:29:49,046 --> 00:29:50,250
I would.

449
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:52,051
I really would.

450
00:29:52,565 --> 00:29:55,713
If only I'd had more than a salad for lunch.

451
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:56,883
See...

452
00:29:57,568 --> 00:29:59,693
- I'm starving.
- No!

453
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:35,040
My last call with Dean...

454
00:30:36,078 --> 00:30:37,541
It was you.

455
00:30:38,118 --> 00:30:39,903
You led me here.

456
00:30:42,578 --> 00:30:44,562
Some calls I make,

457
00:30:44,566 --> 00:30:46,442
some calls I take.

458
00:30:47,406 --> 00:30:48,942
But you have to admit,

459
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,092
I had you fooled for a while.

460
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:54,730
All that Edison phone crap...

461
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:03,830
What are you doing?

462
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:08,271
I'm killing your brother.

463
00:31:09,405 --> 00:31:11,741
Or maybe I'm killing another guy.

464
00:31:12,986 --> 00:31:14,912
We'll just have to see how it goes.

465
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:29,611
Hello?

466
00:31:29,675 --> 00:31:30,901
<i>Hi, daddy.</i>

467
00:31:32,536 --> 00:31:34,022
Hey, baby.

468
00:31:36,275 --> 00:31:38,693
I thought you said
you weren't gonna call anymore.

469
00:31:38,738 --> 00:31:40,701
<i>I know, daddy.</i>

470
00:31:42,055 --> 00:31:44,220
You know how sad this makes your old man.

471
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:48,883
How upset I was at your funeral.

472
00:31:49,548 --> 00:31:52,592
<i>I had to call.
I know who killed me, daddy.</i>

473
00:31:54,065 --> 00:31:55,221
What?

474
00:31:55,597 --> 00:31:59,402
<i>The man who killed me,
he's at the house right now.</i>

475
00:31:59,508 --> 00:32:01,862
What... what are you saying to me?

476
00:32:01,936 --> 00:32:05,951
<i>He's at the house, daddy.
He wants to kill you, too.</i>

477
00:32:15,048 --> 00:32:17,302
You know,
mimicking Dean's one thing.

478
00:32:17,407 --> 00:32:18,970
But my dad...

479
00:32:18,985 --> 00:32:20,630
that's a hell of a trick.

480
00:32:20,676 --> 00:32:22,641
Once I made you two as hunters,

481
00:32:22,645 --> 00:32:23,913
it was easy.

482
00:32:27,505 --> 00:32:29,132
Found Dean's number,

483
00:32:29,135 --> 00:32:31,022
then your number,

484
00:32:31,077 --> 00:32:32,713
Then your father's numbers,

485
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:34,763
then to e-mails,

486
00:32:34,775 --> 00:32:36,643
voice mails...

487
00:32:37,127 --> 00:32:38,593
Everything.

488
00:32:39,455 --> 00:32:42,841
You see, people think
that that stuff just gets erased.

489
00:32:43,115 --> 00:32:44,470
But it doesn't.

490
00:32:45,475 --> 00:32:47,443
You'd be surprised at how much of yourself

491
00:32:47,525 --> 00:32:49,601
is just floating out there,

492
00:32:50,046 --> 00:32:52,403
waiting to be plucked.

493
00:32:52,878 --> 00:32:54,700
Dean's not gonna fall for this.

494
00:32:56,235 --> 00:32:58,511
He's not gonna kill that guy.

495
00:32:58,615 --> 00:33:00,541
Then the guy kills him.

496
00:34:19,096 --> 00:34:21,023
Technology...

497
00:34:24,536 --> 00:34:26,992
...makes life so much easier.

498
00:34:29,045 --> 00:34:30,460
It used to be I'd...

499
00:34:30,465 --> 00:34:32,772
I'd hide in the woods for days,

500
00:34:33,007 --> 00:34:34,222
weeks,

501
00:34:34,627 --> 00:34:36,422
whispering to people,

502
00:34:37,655 --> 00:34:39,941
trying to draw them out into the night.

503
00:34:41,516 --> 00:34:43,720
But they had community.

504
00:34:44,505 --> 00:34:46,991
They all looked out after each other.

505
00:34:47,066 --> 00:34:50,311
I'd be lucky to eat
maybe one, two souls a year.

506
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:55,540
But now when I'm hungry,
I simply make a phone call.

507
00:34:55,905 --> 00:34:58,251
You're all so connected...

508
00:34:59,936 --> 00:35:02,523
but you've never been so alone.

509
00:35:40,026 --> 00:35:41,293
What is this?

510
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:42,710
Your funeral.

511
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,020
Did you do this to my daughter, too?

512
00:35:54,808 --> 00:35:57,510
- How the hell did you get out?
- Did you do this to my daughter, too?!

513
00:35:57,605 --> 00:36:00,111
- Wait. This is a mistake.
- You killed her!

514
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:01,930
You killed her, you son of a bitch!

515
00:36:41,058 --> 00:36:42,791
She was 9 years old!

516
00:36:42,836 --> 00:36:44,512
Stop! I didn't!

517
00:36:44,996 --> 00:36:46,520
You got to believe me!

518
00:36:53,895 --> 00:36:55,902
Why did you kill her?

519
00:36:56,386 --> 00:36:57,573
I'm sorry.

520
00:36:58,017 --> 00:37:00,190
I didn't kill your daughter.

521
00:37:02,018 --> 00:37:04,452
Then what are you doing here?

522
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:09,311
I don't know.

523
00:37:22,577 --> 00:37:24,920
I see they improved your face.

524
00:37:26,075 --> 00:37:27,811
Right back at you.

525
00:37:32,387 --> 00:37:34,250
So, crocotta, huh?

526
00:37:34,846 --> 00:37:36,121
Yep.

527
00:37:36,227 --> 00:37:37,870
That would explain the flies.

528
00:37:37,975 --> 00:37:39,263
Yeah, it would.

529
00:37:42,966 --> 00:37:44,532
Hey, um...

530
00:37:45,506 --> 00:37:47,443
Look, I'm sorry it wasn't dad.

531
00:37:49,047 --> 00:37:51,533
I gave you a hell of a time on this one.

532
00:37:51,965 --> 00:37:53,582
No, you were right.

533
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:54,881
Forget about it.

534
00:37:56,516 --> 00:37:58,072
I can't.

535
00:38:00,006 --> 00:38:03,122
I wanted to believe so badly
that there was a way out of this.

536
00:38:05,585 --> 00:38:08,043
I mean, I'm staring
down the barrel at this thing...

537
00:38:09,858 --> 00:38:11,211
You know, hell...

538
00:38:12,278 --> 00:38:15,031
for real, forever, and I'm just...

539
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,153
Yeah.

540
00:38:21,088 --> 00:38:22,911
I'm scared, Sam.

541
00:38:24,856 --> 00:38:26,222
I'm really scared.

542
00:38:28,077 --> 00:38:29,341
I know.

543
00:38:33,598 --> 00:38:35,702
I guess I was willing to believe anything.

544
00:38:36,486 --> 00:38:38,701
You know,
last act of a desperate man.

545
00:38:38,806 --> 00:38:40,551
There's nothing wrong with
having hope, you know.

546
00:38:40,596 --> 00:38:42,391
Hope doesn't get you jack squat.

547
00:38:43,035 --> 00:38:45,362
I can't expect dad to show up

548
00:38:45,395 --> 00:38:47,383
with some miracle at the last minute.

549
00:38:47,415 --> 00:38:49,591
I can't expect anybody to, you know?

550
00:38:51,576 --> 00:38:54,221
And the only person that
can get me out of this thing is me.

551
00:38:58,577 --> 00:38:59,813
And me.

552
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,282
"And me"?

553
00:39:07,055 --> 00:39:08,101
What?

554
00:39:08,116 --> 00:39:10,002
Deep revelation, having a real moment here,

555
00:39:10,046 --> 00:39:12,911
that's what you come back with,
"And me"?

556
00:39:13,547 --> 00:39:15,810
- Do you want a poem?
- Moment's gone.

557
00:39:18,505 --> 00:39:20,031
Unbelievable.
