1
00:00:06,247 --> 00:00:07,757
I remember now.
I'm an angel.

2
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:09,467
I have a death sentence on my head.

3
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:10,850
- Why?
- I disobeyed.

4
00:00:10,975 --> 00:00:12,509
You really shouldn't have come.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,851
- You have to stop it.
- Stop what?

6
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:23,069
1973?

7
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,691
- Mom?
- John Winchester.

8
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:32,365
My parents are
Mary and John Winchester.

9
00:00:32,757 --> 00:00:34,033
And I am your grandson.

10
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:37,308
Mary gets killed
by a yellow-eyed demon in 1983.

11
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:40,515
Now, if we don't catch this thing now
and kill it and it gets away...

12
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:41,790
Then Mary dies.

13
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:52,843
I couldn't stop any of it.
She still made the deal.

14
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,679
- She still died in the nursery?
- Destiny can't be changed, Dean.

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,683
All roads lead
to the Same destination.

16
00:01:06,713 --> 00:01:08,934
I take it all back.
I love the devil.

17
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,984
That's what I call peace on earth.

18
00:01:40,862 --> 00:01:43,143
I was just working on a case.

19
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:45,266
This is what you dream about.

20
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:49,243
This is awkward.

21
00:01:50,553 --> 00:01:53,571
Why are you gate-crashing my head?
Why don't you just swing by the motel?

22
00:01:55,177 --> 00:01:56,316
I can't find you.

23
00:01:57,478 --> 00:01:58,864
Cass did this thing.

24
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,536
Cass. Right.

25
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,260
Now, there's a friend
you can count on.

26
00:02:03,598 --> 00:02:04,489
What?

27
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:06,926
He didn't tell you?

28
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:09,907
- Tell me what?
- Where I've been.

29
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:12,146
Of course not.
Why would he?

30
00:02:12,963 --> 00:02:14,088
Where have you been?

31
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,167
Prison.

32
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:18,183
Upstairs.

33
00:02:19,385 --> 00:02:21,348
All the torture,
twice the self-righteousness.

34
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,304
Why wouldn't he have told us
where you were?

35
00:02:23,429 --> 00:02:25,825
'cause he's the one who turned me in.
Don't look so shocked.

36
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,553
He was always a good little soldier.

37
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:29,990
- Did anything under orders.
- I didn't know.

38
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:31,287
Are you okay?

39
00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:33,986
No.

40
00:02:34,618 --> 00:02:35,905
And I don't have long.

41
00:02:36,726 --> 00:02:38,587
I broke out...
Barely.

42
00:02:38,894 --> 00:02:40,848
They're looking for me.
If they find me...

43
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:45,446
- What do you need?
- Meet me. 225 industrial.

44
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:48,507
And, please, just hurry.

45
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:21,116
Hello?

46
00:03:22,184 --> 00:03:23,069
Who's there?

47
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:31,744
Hello, Anna.

48
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:35,753
Well...

49
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:38,525
If I didn't know any better...

50
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:42,988
I'd say the Winchesters
don't trust me.

51
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:45,346
They do.
I don't.

52
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:48,096
I wouldn't let them come.

53
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:49,630
And why is that?

54
00:03:49,755 --> 00:03:52,117
If you're out of prison,
it's because they let you out.

55
00:03:52,325 --> 00:03:54,449
And they sent you here to do
their dirty work.

56
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,046
And what makes you so sure?

57
00:03:56,392 --> 00:03:58,104
Because I've experienced...

58
00:03:58,862 --> 00:04:01,824
- Heaven's persuasion.
- You mean when you gave me to them.

59
00:04:03,682 --> 00:04:04,919
That was a mistake.

60
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:09,312
Whatever they sent you here to do...

61
00:04:09,437 --> 00:04:10,854
They didn't send me.

62
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:13,970
- I escaped.
- No one escapes.

63
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:17,798
All these centuries
and you're underestimating me now?

64
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:20,767
If you're not one of them,
then what do you want?

65
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:22,202
I want to help.

66
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,705
You want to help?
Then what are doing with that knife?

67
00:04:33,394 --> 00:04:35,735
- I'm not allowed to defend myself?
- Against whom?

68
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:38,939
That blade doesn't work against angels.
It's not like this one.

69
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:42,459
Maybe you're not working for heaven.

70
00:04:42,584 --> 00:04:44,449
But there's something
you're not telling me.

71
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:51,632
Sam Winchester has to die.

72
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,482
= 513 =

73
00:04:57,238 --> 00:04:59,985
= Supernatural Team =

74
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:05,387
I am sorry.
But we have no choice.

75
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,255
He's lucifer's vessel.

76
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,391
- He's not the only one.
- What? That guy Nick?

77
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:12,272
He's burning away as we speak.

78
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,232
Sam is the only vessel that matters.

79
00:05:18,112 --> 00:05:19,380
You know what that means.

80
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:23,280
If lucifer can't take Sam,
his whole plan short-circuits.

81
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:26,685
No fight with Michael,
no croatoan virus,

82
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,104
the horsemen go back
to their day jobs.

83
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:30,845
Even if you could...

84
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:34,332
Kill Sam, Satan would just
bring him back to life.

85
00:05:34,457 --> 00:05:37,283
Not after I scatter his cells
across the universe.

86
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:39,584
They'll never find him...

87
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:41,316
Not all of him.

88
00:05:45,522 --> 00:05:46,821
We'll find another way.

89
00:05:48,788 --> 00:05:49,963
How's that going?

90
00:05:50,953 --> 00:05:54,046
How's The Colt working out?
Or the search for god?

91
00:05:54,763 --> 00:05:56,334
Is anything working?

92
00:05:57,172 --> 00:06:00,877
If you want to stop
the devil, this is how.

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,570
The answer is still no.

94
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:07,891
Because Sam is my friend.

95
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:11,996
You've changed.

96
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,915
Maybe too late.

97
00:06:16,146 --> 00:06:17,297
But I have.

98
00:06:19,974 --> 00:06:22,256
Anna, we've been
through much together.

99
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:25,523
But you come near Sam Winchester
and I'll kill you.

100
00:06:45,426 --> 00:06:46,354
Oh, my god.

101
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:51,362
You okay?

102
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:53,620
We have to get her to a hospital.
Come on.

103
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:03,056
Really? Anna?

104
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:06,799
- I don't believe it.
- It's true.

105
00:07:07,325 --> 00:07:09,824
So she's gone all Glenn Close?
That's awesome.

106
00:07:10,456 --> 00:07:11,704
Who's Glenn Close?

107
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,699
No one. Just this psycho bitch
who likes to boil rabbits.

108
00:07:14,985 --> 00:07:18,652
So, the plan to kill me
would it actually stop Satan?

109
00:07:18,777 --> 00:07:20,110
No, Sam, come on.

110
00:07:20,235 --> 00:07:21,520
Cass, what do you think?

111
00:07:21,645 --> 00:07:23,176
Does Anna have a point?

112
00:07:25,948 --> 00:07:26,659
No.

113
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:29,737
She's a "Glenn Close."

114
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:34,908
I don't get it. We're looking
for the chick that wants to gank Sam?

115
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:38,086
- Why poke the bear?
- Anna will keep trying.

116
00:07:38,211 --> 00:07:40,211
She won't give up until Sam is dead.

117
00:07:42,203 --> 00:07:43,796
So we kill her first.

118
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,302
- I found her.
- Where is she?

119
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:08,716
Not where.

120
00:08:09,582 --> 00:08:10,423
When.

121
00:08:12,044 --> 00:08:13,075
It's 1978.

122
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:14,855
What?

123
00:08:16,725 --> 00:08:19,061
Why 1978?
I wasn't even born yet.

124
00:08:19,837 --> 00:08:22,472
You won't be...
If she kills your parents.

125
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:23,668
What?

126
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:26,691
Anna can't get to you because of me.

127
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,549
- So she's going after them.
- Take us back right now.

128
00:08:29,674 --> 00:08:31,081
And deliver you right to Anna?

129
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:32,515
I should go alone.

130
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,420
They're our parents, Cass.
We're going.

131
00:08:34,545 --> 00:08:35,764
It's not that easy.

132
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:36,753
Why not?

133
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:40,250
Time travel was difficult even with
the powers of heaven at my disposal.

134
00:08:40,507 --> 00:08:41,608
But you're cut off.

135
00:08:41,874 --> 00:08:44,069
So, what? You're like a delorean
without enough plutonium.

136
00:08:44,194 --> 00:08:45,816
I don't understand that reference.

137
00:08:46,413 --> 00:08:50,112
But I'm telling you, taking this trip,
with passengers, no less...

138
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,615
... it'll weaken me.

139
00:08:54,837 --> 00:08:56,743
They're our mom and dad.

140
00:08:57,658 --> 00:09:00,021
If we can save them
and not just from Anna...

141
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:02,128
I mean,
if we can set things right...

142
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,668
We have to try.

143
00:09:12,013 --> 00:09:13,013
Ready?

144
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:17,756
- Not really.
- Bend your knees.

145
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,413


146
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:37,503
Did we make it?

147
00:09:38,518 --> 00:09:42,024
Unless they're bringing pintos back
into production, I'd say yes.

148
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:48,725
Take it easy. Take it easy.
You all right?

149
00:09:48,997 --> 00:09:50,148
I'm fine.

150
00:09:50,717 --> 00:09:52,424
I'm much better than I expected.

151
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:58,721
He's breathing...
Sort of.

152
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,339
What do we do?

153
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:12,935
I mean, the mustaches alone...

154
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:16,100
So I paid for Cass for five nights up
in the honeymoon suite.

155
00:10:16,262 --> 00:10:18,280
I told the manager:
"Do not disturb no matter what".

156
00:10:18,405 --> 00:10:20,441
You know what he said to me?
"Yeah. Don't sweat it.

157
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:21,863
Want to buy some dope?"

158
00:10:22,646 --> 00:10:23,403
Dope.

159
00:10:24,112 --> 00:10:26,387
We ought to stick around here,
buy some stock in Microsoft.

160
00:10:26,512 --> 00:10:28,959
We might have to
if Cass doesn't recover.

161
00:10:30,624 --> 00:10:31,589
Is he all right?

162
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,619
What do I look like
Dr. Angel, medicine woman?

163
00:10:34,171 --> 00:10:35,297
He'll wake up.

164
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:37,516
He's tough for a little nerdy dude
with wings.

165
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:39,604
If he landed like that,
hopefully, so did Anna.

166
00:10:39,851 --> 00:10:41,890
- Should buy us some time.
- So, did you find 'em?

167
00:10:43,188 --> 00:10:45,435
The Winchesters.
485 Tobin Tree.

168
00:10:46,238 --> 00:10:47,785
Let's go pop in on the folks.

169
00:11:02,502 --> 00:11:03,475
Wait, wait.

170
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,049
Anna could be here any second.

171
00:11:05,174 --> 00:11:07,269
What exactly are we gonna
march up there and tell 'em?

172
00:11:07,394 --> 00:11:08,198
The truth.

173
00:11:08,323 --> 00:11:10,928
That their sons are back from the future
to save them from an angel

174
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:12,136
gone "terminator"?

175
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:14,114
Those movies haven't even
come out yet.

176
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:16,644
Then tell her demons are after'em.
She thinks you're a hunter?

177
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:18,888
A hunter who disappeared right
when her dad died.

178
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,293
She's gonna love me.

179
00:11:22,402 --> 00:11:23,639
Just follow my lead.

180
00:11:30,109 --> 00:11:31,346
How was work?

181
00:11:32,212 --> 00:11:34,390
It was great.

182
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:37,903
Not until you wash up.

183
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:40,086
I love when you get bossy.

184
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:51,526
Hi, Mary.

185
00:11:52,942 --> 00:11:54,104
You can't be here.

186
00:11:54,229 --> 00:11:57,334
- I'm sorry if this is a bad time.
- You don't understand. I'm not...

187
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,058
I don't do that anymore.

188
00:12:01,475 --> 00:12:02,819
I have a normal life now.

189
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:04,104
You have to go.

190
00:12:04,229 --> 00:12:06,494
I'm sorry,
but this is important, okay?

191
00:12:08,957 --> 00:12:10,707
Sorry, sweetie, they're just...

192
00:12:11,206 --> 00:12:12,242
Mary's cousins.

193
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,472
We couldn't stop through town
without swinging by

194
00:12:14,597 --> 00:12:16,055
and saying "hey," now, could we?

195
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:17,259
Dean.

196
00:12:18,707 --> 00:12:19,808
You look familiar.

197
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:21,043
Really?

198
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:24,347
You do, too, actually, you know?

199
00:12:24,537 --> 00:12:26,503
We must have met sometime.
Small towns, right?

200
00:12:26,628 --> 00:12:28,329
- Got to love 'em.
- I'm John.

201
00:12:33,832 --> 00:12:34,752
This is Sam.

202
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,839
Sam.
Mary's father was a Sam.

203
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:39,424
It's a family name.

204
00:12:44,161 --> 00:12:45,990
You okay, pal?
You look a little spooked.

205
00:12:49,527 --> 00:12:52,045
Just a long trip.

206
00:12:53,502 --> 00:12:56,191
Sam and Dean
were just on their way out.

207
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,380
What?
They just got here.

208
00:12:58,505 --> 00:13:00,237
Real happy to meet folks
from Mary's side.

209
00:13:00,556 --> 00:13:02,284
Please come on in for a beer.

210
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:04,114
Twist my arm.

211
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:13,140
Are you sure you're okay, Sam?

212
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:16,627
I'm just...

213
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:20,703
You are so beautiful.

214
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:26,021
He means that in a non-weird,
wholesome, family kind of a way.

215
00:13:26,436 --> 00:13:27,311
Right.

216
00:13:27,436 --> 00:13:30,086
We haven't seen Mary
in quite some time and...

217
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:32,971
See, she's the spitting image
of our mom.

218
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:34,987
- I mean, it's...
- Eerie.

219
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,514
So, how are you guys related?

220
00:13:40,048 --> 00:13:41,483
You know, distantly.

221
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:45,073
- So you knew Mary's parents?
- Yeah, yeah.

222
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:47,438
Mary's dad was...

223
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:50,431
Pretty much like a grandpa to us.

224
00:13:53,105 --> 00:13:54,293
That was tragic...

225
00:13:54,763 --> 00:13:55,917
That heart attack.

226
00:13:58,511 --> 00:14:00,008
Yes, it was.

227
00:14:02,619 --> 00:14:05,464
So what are you guys
doing in town, anyway?

228
00:14:05,748 --> 00:14:06,809
Business, you know.

229
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:08,001
What line of work?

230
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:09,490
- Plumbing.
- Scrap metal.

231
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:10,744
It's almost 7:00.

232
00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:13,110
I hate to be rude,
but I got to get dinner ready.

233
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:15,523
- Maybe they could stay.
- I'm sure they have to leave.

234
00:14:17,948 --> 00:14:19,541
Look, please stay.

235
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:21,368
You know, it would mean a lot to me.

236
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,085
I haven't met much
of Mary's side of the family.

237
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,969
Look, Mr. Woodson,
I'm begging you to reconsider.

238
00:14:32,094 --> 00:14:33,111
I'd like to, John.

239
00:14:33,236 --> 00:14:36,275
You're a great mechanic.
But times ain't exactly rosy.

240
00:14:36,463 --> 00:14:39,393
Even just part time.
I really need this job.

241
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:42,590
All right, look.
Come on in right now, let's talk.

242
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,629
Maybe we can figure something out.

243
00:14:44,975 --> 00:14:45,953
You serious?

244
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,030
I'll see you in 10 minutes.
Don't keep me waiting.

245
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,186
You have to leave.
Now.

246
00:14:51,311 --> 00:14:52,849
- Just listen...
- No, you listen.

247
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:55,685
Last time I saw you,
a demon killed my parents.

248
00:14:56,392 --> 00:14:58,591
Now you waltz
in here like you're family?

249
00:14:59,037 --> 00:15:00,717
Whatever you want... no.

250
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,859
- Leave me alone.
- You and John are in danger.

251
00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:07,113
- What are you talking about?
- Something's coming for you.

252
00:15:08,317 --> 00:15:09,208
Demon?

253
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,444
Not exactly.

254
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:12,127
What, then?

255
00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:14,754
- It's kind of hard to explain. It's...
- An angel.

256
00:15:16,472 --> 00:15:17,289
What?

257
00:15:18,105 --> 00:15:20,069
- There's no such thing.
- I wish.

258
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,728
But they're twice as strong
as demons and bigger dicks.

259
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:25,845
Why would an angel want to kill us?

260
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,030
It's a long story
and we'll tell you the whole thing,

261
00:15:28,155 --> 00:15:30,513
but right now, you've got to trust us
and we got to go.

262
00:15:31,691 --> 00:15:33,890
Look at my face
and tell me if I'm lying to you.

263
00:15:36,732 --> 00:15:39,479
Okay.
Where do we go?

264
00:15:39,793 --> 00:15:41,469
Out of here.
We got to move now, though.

265
00:15:41,594 --> 00:15:44,031
- But what do I tell John?
- Just tell him...

266
00:15:46,631 --> 00:15:47,435
John?

267
00:16:08,431 --> 00:16:09,718
Mr. Woodson?

268
00:16:11,413 --> 00:16:12,675
You still here?

269
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,643
I wish I could say
it's good to see you.

270
00:16:59,844 --> 00:17:00,844
You too, Dean.

271
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:33,676
I'm sorry.

272
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:12,424
Sorry.

273
00:18:12,729 --> 00:18:14,529
It's not that easy to kill an angel.

274
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:16,286
No.

275
00:18:17,035 --> 00:18:18,285
But you can distract 'em.

276
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,986


277
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:42,220
Monsters.

278
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:43,906
Monsters?

279
00:18:44,403 --> 00:18:45,152
Yes.

280
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:47,883
- Monsters are real.
- I'm sorry, I didn't know how...

281
00:18:48,008 --> 00:18:49,372
And you fight them?

282
00:18:50,052 --> 00:18:52,141
- All of you?
- Yeah.

283
00:18:55,129 --> 00:18:56,280
How long?

284
00:18:58,129 --> 00:18:59,204
All my life.

285
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:03,705
John, just try to understand...
 

286
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,316
Shut up, all of you!

287
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,576
Not another word, or so help me,
I will turn this car around!

288
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:17,540
Wow. Awkward family road trip.

289
00:19:18,473 --> 00:19:19,824
No kidding.

290
00:19:29,316 --> 00:19:31,196
Place has been
in the family for years.

291
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:35,563
Devil's trap.

292
00:19:36,244 --> 00:19:37,926
Pure iron fixtures, of course.

293
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:42,519
There should be salt and holy water
in the pantry, knives, guns.

294
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,442
All that stuff will
do is piss it off.

295
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:45,846
So, what will kill it?

296
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,870
Or slow it down, at least?

297
00:19:48,934 --> 00:19:51,171
- Not much.
- Great.

298
00:19:51,795 --> 00:19:53,525
He said not much, not nothing.

299
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,134
We packed.

300
00:19:58,938 --> 00:20:00,288
If we put this up

301
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,535
and she comes close,

302
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:06,538
we beam her right off the starship.

303
00:20:08,481 --> 00:20:09,831
This is holy oil.

304
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:12,706
It's kind of like a devil's trap
for angels.

305
00:20:13,777 --> 00:20:15,213
I'll show you how it works.

306
00:20:25,563 --> 00:20:27,723
What's the deal
with the thing on the paper?

307
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:29,775
It's a sigil.

308
00:20:30,668 --> 00:20:32,355
- That means...
- I don't care.

309
00:20:32,656 --> 00:20:33,731
Where does it go?

310
00:20:35,516 --> 00:20:37,016
On a wall or a door.

311
00:20:37,787 --> 00:20:39,237
How big should I make it?

312
00:20:41,213 --> 00:20:42,613
- John...
- What?

313
00:20:44,044 --> 00:20:46,870
Y'all might have treated me
like a fool, but I am not useless.

314
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,788
I can draw

315
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,657
a damn... Whatever it is...
A sigil.

316
00:20:53,308 --> 00:20:54,608
Go help Sam out.

317
00:20:55,717 --> 00:20:57,967
Cause this has got to be done in...

318
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:00,606
In human blood.

319
00:21:13,904 --> 00:21:15,004
So, how big?

320
00:21:18,647 --> 00:21:19,847
I'll show you.

321
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:24,281
What?

322
00:21:27,915 --> 00:21:30,865
All of a sudden,
you really remind me of my dad.

323
00:21:48,148 --> 00:21:49,598
That's really good.

324
00:21:51,783 --> 00:21:53,483
You come to check on me?

325
00:21:57,113 --> 00:21:59,713
I wanted to say I'm sorry
about all this.

326
00:21:59,948 --> 00:22:01,269
I know it's a lot.

327
00:22:01,394 --> 00:22:02,862
How long have you known

328
00:22:03,738 --> 00:22:05,488
about this hunting stuff?

329
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:09,079
Pretty much forever.

330
00:22:09,972 --> 00:22:12,672
- My dad raised me in it.
- You're serious?

331
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:16,292
Who the hell does that to a kid?

332
00:22:17,892 --> 00:22:19,879
For the record, Mary's parents did.

333
00:22:20,216 --> 00:22:21,366
I don't care.

334
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:24,342
What kind of irresponsible bastard
lets a child

335
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,810
anywhere near...

336
00:22:25,935 --> 00:22:27,553
You could've been killed!

337
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:30,284
Came kind of close.

338
00:22:31,774 --> 00:22:33,726
The number it must've done
on your head.

339
00:22:35,473 --> 00:22:37,897
Your father
was supposed to protect you.

340
00:22:39,928 --> 00:22:41,128
He was trying.

341
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:45,183
He died trying.

342
00:22:49,414 --> 00:22:50,564
Believe me...

343
00:22:54,905 --> 00:22:57,305
I used to be mad at him,
I used to...

344
00:22:59,454 --> 00:23:00,827
I used to hate the guy.

345
00:23:00,952 --> 00:23:02,052
But now I...

346
00:23:03,734 --> 00:23:04,734
I get it.

347
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:05,859
He was...

348
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:08,261
Doing his best.

349
00:23:09,731 --> 00:23:12,131
And he was trying
to keep it together

350
00:23:12,256 --> 00:23:14,100
in this impossible situation.

351
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:18,096
See...

352
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,730
My mom...

353
00:23:23,398 --> 00:23:25,903
She was amazing, beautiful, and...

354
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,865
She was the love of his life.

355
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,226
And she got killed.

356
00:23:34,895 --> 00:23:37,874
I think he would have gone crazy
if he didn't do something.

357
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:43,620
Truth is...

358
00:23:44,651 --> 00:23:45,701
My dad died

359
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:48,889
before I got to tell him that...

360
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:53,129
I understand...

361
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,300
Why he did what he did.

362
00:23:57,902 --> 00:23:59,252
And I forgive him

363
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,880
for what it did to us. I do.

364
00:24:02,804 --> 00:24:03,954
And I just...

365
00:24:08,477 --> 00:24:09,527
I love him.

366
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:25,709
Uriel.

367
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,220
- You look well.
- You shouldn't have called.

368
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:34,902
We're under strict orders
not to come down here.

369
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:37,892
Much less take a vessel.

370
00:24:42,557 --> 00:24:43,937
You're not the Anna of now.

371
00:24:44,606 --> 00:24:47,506
But 30 years from now,
I'm still your superior.

372
00:24:49,391 --> 00:24:51,155
I need you to kill some humans.

373
00:24:51,631 --> 00:24:53,658
Always happy to do some smiting.

374
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,697
What's going on?

375
00:24:55,822 --> 00:24:58,913
In the future, these people
are going to kill you, Uriel.

376
00:25:01,523 --> 00:25:03,876
I'm giving you the chance
to kill them first.

377
00:25:05,317 --> 00:25:06,317
Thank you.

378
00:25:14,703 --> 00:25:17,098
You said you'd explain everything
when we had a minute.

379
00:25:17,655 --> 00:25:19,005
We have a minute.

380
00:25:19,775 --> 00:25:21,825
Why does an angel want me dead?

381
00:25:25,535 --> 00:25:27,024
Cause they're dicks.

382
00:25:28,073 --> 00:25:29,373
Not good enough.

383
00:25:30,385 --> 00:25:32,864
I didn't even know they existed
and now I'm a target?

384
00:25:34,718 --> 00:25:36,068
It's complicated.

385
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,409
Fine.

386
00:25:39,757 --> 00:25:40,757
All ears.

387
00:25:45,548 --> 00:25:46,627
Trust me, okay?

388
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,713
I've been trusting you all day.

389
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:53,422
- It's kinda hard to believe.
- All right, then.

390
00:25:53,547 --> 00:25:55,344
- I'm walking out.
- I'm your son.

391
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,265
What?

392
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:06,431
I'm your son.

393
00:26:07,676 --> 00:26:09,150
I don't know how else to say it.

394
00:26:10,928 --> 00:26:12,945
We're from the year 2010.

395
00:26:13,857 --> 00:26:15,807
An angel zapped us back here.

396
00:26:17,281 --> 00:26:19,619
Not the one that attacked you.
Friendlier.

397
00:26:21,076 --> 00:26:23,376
You can't expect me to believe that.

398
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,475
Our names
are Dean and Sam Winchester.

399
00:26:31,612 --> 00:26:33,662
We're named after your parents.

400
00:26:35,836 --> 00:26:37,436
When I would get sick,

401
00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:40,723
you would make me tomato-rice soup,

402
00:26:41,781 --> 00:26:43,719
because that's what your mom
made you.

403
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:46,654
And instead of a lullaby,

404
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,410
you would sing Hey Jude.

405
00:26:51,707 --> 00:26:53,592
Cause that's your favorite
Beatles song.

406
00:26:58,129 --> 00:26:59,579
I don't believe it.

407
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,621
It's true.

408
00:27:06,824 --> 00:27:09,794
I raised my kids to be hunters?

409
00:27:12,087 --> 00:27:14,423
- No, you didn't.
- How could I do that to you?

410
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,641
You didn't.

411
00:27:18,502 --> 00:27:20,002
Because you're dead.

412
00:27:24,298 --> 00:27:25,298
What?

413
00:27:25,821 --> 00:27:26,852
What happened?

414
00:27:28,906 --> 00:27:30,306
Yellow-eyed demon.

415
00:27:32,844 --> 00:27:34,394
He killed you, and...

416
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:39,699
John became a hunter to get revenge.

417
00:27:41,797 --> 00:27:43,597
He raised us in this life.

418
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,207
Listen to me.

419
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:53,033
A demon comes into Sam's nursery

420
00:27:53,949 --> 00:27:55,761
exactly six months after he's born.

421
00:27:55,886 --> 00:27:58,551
November 2, 1983.
Remember that date.

422
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,319
And whatever you do...

423
00:28:01,996 --> 00:28:03,431
Do not go in there.

424
00:28:03,687 --> 00:28:05,766
That morning,
you take Sam and you run.

425
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,584
That's not good enough.

426
00:28:10,651 --> 00:28:13,149
Wherever she goes,
the demon's gonna find her.

427
00:28:14,421 --> 00:28:15,421
Find me.

428
00:28:16,247 --> 00:28:17,547
Well, then what?

429
00:28:21,411 --> 00:28:23,511
She can leave dad.
That's what.

430
00:28:27,937 --> 00:28:29,384
You gotta leave john.

431
00:28:29,861 --> 00:28:31,261
When this is over,

432
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:33,753
walk away and never look back.

433
00:28:35,457 --> 00:28:36,957
So we're never born.

434
00:28:37,808 --> 00:28:39,877
- He's right.
- I can't.

435
00:28:41,875 --> 00:28:43,458
You're saying you're my children,

436
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:44,680
and now...

437
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,182
You have no choice.

438
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,254
There's a big difference
between dying and never being born.

439
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:51,687
And trust me, we're okay with it,
I promise you that.

440
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,064
I'm not.

441
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,566
You think you can have that normal life
you want so bad.

442
00:28:57,551 --> 00:28:59,301
But you can't, I'm sorry.

443
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,781
It's gonna go rotten.

444
00:29:02,652 --> 00:29:04,052
You are gonna die,

445
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,912
and your children will be cursed.

446
00:29:15,699 --> 00:29:17,954
- There has to be a way.
- This is the way.

447
00:29:18,749 --> 00:29:20,341
- Leave John.
- I can't.

448
00:29:21,347 --> 00:29:23,534
This is bigger than us.

449
00:29:24,436 --> 00:29:27,544
- There are so many more lives at stake.
- You don't understand.

450
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:28,669
I can't.

451
00:29:32,373 --> 00:29:33,562
It's too late.

452
00:29:39,464 --> 00:29:40,614
I'm pregnant.

453
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:46,427
We got a problem.

454
00:29:46,941 --> 00:29:48,691
The sigils, they're gone.

455
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:52,123
- Gone as in...
- I drew one the door, I turned around.

456
00:29:52,306 --> 00:29:54,125
When I looked again,
it was a smudge.

457
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:01,301
He's right.

458
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:03,175
There's no more holy oil.

459
00:30:18,194 --> 00:30:18,816


460
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:40,146
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Uriel.

461
00:30:41,775 --> 00:30:42,775
Come on...

462
00:30:43,371 --> 00:30:44,371
Go.

463
00:30:50,204 --> 00:30:51,604
Here goes nothin'.

464
00:32:02,317 --> 00:32:04,412
I'm really sorry.

465
00:32:05,843 --> 00:32:06,843
Anna...

466
00:32:12,058 --> 00:32:13,058
Michael.

467
00:32:43,017 --> 00:32:44,086
I didn't know.

468
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,422
Goodbye, Uriel.

469
00:32:51,114 --> 00:32:53,846
- What did you do to John?
- John is fine.

470
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,088
Who... What are you?

471
00:33:09,336 --> 00:33:12,114
Well, I'd say this conversation
is long overdue,

472
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:13,282
wouldn't you?

473
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:15,007
- Fix him.
- First...

474
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:17,628
We talk.

475
00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:21,609
Then
I fix your darling little Sammy.

476
00:33:24,472 --> 00:33:26,172
How'd you get in my dad?

477
00:33:26,482 --> 00:33:29,840
I told him I could save his wife,
and he said yes.

478
00:33:31,689 --> 00:33:35,262
I guess they oversold me
being your one and only vessel.

479
00:33:36,396 --> 00:33:39,016
You're my true vessel
but not my only one.

480
00:33:39,338 --> 00:33:41,769
- What is that supposed to mean?
- It's a bloodline.

481
00:33:42,334 --> 00:33:45,345
- A bloodline?
- Stretching back to Cain and Abel.

482
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,070
It's in your blood, your father's blood,
your family's blood.

483
00:33:50,234 --> 00:33:51,234
Awesome.

484
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:54,682
Six degrees of heaven bacon.

485
00:33:55,688 --> 00:33:57,159
What do you want with me?

486
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,119
You really don't know?

487
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,121
I ain't gonna say yes,
so why are you here?

488
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,586
- What do you want with me?
- I just want you to understand

489
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:08,053
what you and I have to do.

490
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,255
I get it.

491
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:12,747
You got beef with your brother.

492
00:34:12,872 --> 00:34:15,886
Well, get some therapy, pal,
don't take it out on my planet!

493
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,639
You're wrong.

494
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:23,360
Lucifer defied our Father,

495
00:34:23,485 --> 00:34:25,585
and he betrayed me, but still...

496
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:29,358
I don't want this any more
than you would want to kill Sam.

497
00:34:35,021 --> 00:34:36,671
You know, my brother...

498
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:38,826
I practically raised him.

499
00:34:39,707 --> 00:34:41,745
I took care of him
in a way most people

500
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,713
could never understand,
and I still love him.

501
00:34:49,642 --> 00:34:52,256
But I am going to kill him
because it is right

502
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,497
and I have to.

503
00:34:53,622 --> 00:34:55,342
- Because God says so?
- Yes.

504
00:34:56,436 --> 00:35:00,036
From the beginning, He knew
this was how it was going to end.

505
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:05,853
- And you're gonna do whatever God says.
- Yes, because I am a good son.

506
00:35:08,235 --> 00:35:11,150
Well, trust me, pal,
take it from someone who knows,

507
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:15,268
- that is a dead-end street.
- Think you know better than my father?

508
00:35:16,546 --> 00:35:18,624
One unimportant little man.

509
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:20,585
What makes you think
you get to choose?

510
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,410
Because I got to believe

511
00:35:23,074 --> 00:35:25,524
that I can choose what I do
with my...

512
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,245
Unimportant little life.

513
00:35:30,614 --> 00:35:31,764
You're wrong.

514
00:35:32,673 --> 00:35:33,922
You know how I know?

515
00:35:39,755 --> 00:35:42,329
Think of a million

516
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:45,249
random acts of chance

517
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:47,978
that let John and Mary be born,

518
00:35:48,393 --> 00:35:51,871
to meet, to fall in love,
to have the two of you.

519
00:35:53,593 --> 00:35:56,278
Think of the million random choices
that you make,

520
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,628
and yet how each
and every one of them

521
00:35:58,753 --> 00:36:00,449
brings you closer to your destiny.

522
00:36:04,124 --> 00:36:05,824
Do you know why that is?

523
00:36:08,445 --> 00:36:10,094
Because it's not random.

524
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:11,519
It's not chance.

525
00:36:12,169 --> 00:36:15,605
It's a plan
that is playing itself out perfectly.

526
00:36:19,396 --> 00:36:21,345
Free will's an illusion, Dean.

527
00:36:23,522 --> 00:36:25,772
That's why you're going to say yes.

528
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,030
Buck up.

529
00:36:29,675 --> 00:36:32,064
It could be worse.
Unlike my brothers,

530
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,566
I won't leave you a drooling mess
when I'm done.

531
00:36:36,012 --> 00:36:38,189
- What about my dad?
- Better than new.

532
00:36:38,314 --> 00:36:41,464
In fact, I'm gonna do your mom
and your dad a favor.

533
00:36:42,717 --> 00:36:44,667
- What?
- Scrub their minds.

534
00:36:45,302 --> 00:36:46,578
They won't rember me

535
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,746
or you.

536
00:36:49,077 --> 00:36:52,478
- You can't do that.
- I'm giving your mother what she wants.

537
00:36:52,603 --> 00:36:54,914
She can go back to her husband,
her family.

538
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:56,987
She's gonna walk
right into that nursery!

539
00:36:57,112 --> 00:36:58,112
Obviously.

540
00:37:00,283 --> 00:37:03,002
And you always knew
that was going to play out

541
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:04,127
one way

542
00:37:04,707 --> 00:37:05,757
or another.

543
00:37:11,107 --> 00:37:12,855
You can't fight city hall.

544
00:37:29,783 --> 00:37:30,783
He's home.

545
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,792
Safe and sound.

546
00:37:36,426 --> 00:37:37,426
Your turn.

547
00:37:40,442 --> 00:37:42,009
I'll see you soon, Dean.

548
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:50,934


549
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:04,780
- We got you.
- You son of a bitch, you made it.

550
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,533
I did?

551
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:09,629
I'm very surprised.

552
00:38:11,965 --> 00:38:13,565
- You're okay.
- Bed?

553
00:38:21,868 --> 00:38:23,967
Well, I could use that drink now.

554
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,593
- This is it.
- This is what?

555
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:33,081
Team free will.

556
00:38:33,634 --> 00:38:34,811
One ex-blood junkie,

557
00:38:35,821 --> 00:38:37,727
one dropout
with 6 bucks to his name,

558
00:38:37,852 --> 00:38:39,858
and Mr. Comatose over there.
It's awesome.

559
00:38:40,228 --> 00:38:41,318
It's not funny.

560
00:38:42,493 --> 00:38:43,843
I'm not laughing.

561
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:53,009
- They all say we'll say yes.
- I know, it's getting annoying.

562
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:56,301
- What if they're right?
- They're not.

563
00:38:57,555 --> 00:39:00,128
I mean, why would we, either of us?

564
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,500
I've been weak before.

565
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:07,094
- Michael got dad to say yes.
- That was different.

566
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,004
Anna was about to kill mom.

567
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,230
And if you could save mom,

568
00:39:12,807 --> 00:39:14,101
what would you say?

569
00:39:19,309 --> 00:39:21,909
- Where'd you even get it?
- Garage sale.

570
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:23,599
25 cents.

571
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:26,462
Well, I'm glad to hear that, anyway.

572
00:39:28,414 --> 00:39:32,017
I mean, you really don't think
it's just a little cheesy?

573
00:39:34,008 --> 00:39:35,458
I think it's sweet.

574
00:39:38,514 --> 00:39:41,128
Can't even put my finger
on why I like it.

575
00:39:42,606 --> 00:39:43,606
I just...

576
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,128
Like it.

577
00:39:47,787 --> 00:39:49,387
Well, then, I love it.

578
00:40:00,635 --> 00:40:02,085
Quite a kick there.

579
00:40:03,074 --> 00:40:04,624
Troublemaker already.

580
00:40:07,233 --> 00:40:08,533
It's okay, baby.

581
00:40:08,658 --> 00:40:09,858
It's all okay.

582
00:40:12,021 --> 00:40:13,971
Angels are watching over you.
