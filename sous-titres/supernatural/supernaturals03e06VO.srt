4
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,030
i'm busting my ass trying to keep you alive,dean,

5
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,300
and you act like you couldn't care less.

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,630
truth is,i'm tired,sam.

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,160
it's like there's a light at the end of the tunnel.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,000
it's hellfire,dean.whatever.

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,530
you're my big brother.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,130
there's nothing i wouldn't do for you.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,930
and i don't care what it takes. i'm gonna get you out of this.

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,360
well,what can i do for you,sam?

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,160
you can let dean out of his deal right now.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,660
i'm just a saleswoman.i got a boss,like everybody.

15
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,000
he holds the contract.

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,230
and who's your boss?i can't tell you.

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,000
i'm sorry,sam,

18
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,430
but there's no way out of this one.

19
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:22,000
supernatural season 3  episode 6

20
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,000
so,i've been waiting since maple springs.

21
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,260
you got something to tell me?

22
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,260
it's not your birthday.

23
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,700
no.

24
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,060
happy purim?dude,i don't know.

25
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,500
i have no idea what you're talking --

26
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,060
there's a bullet missing from the colt.

27
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,560
you want to tell me how that happened?

28
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,130
i know it wasn't me.

29
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,860
so unless you were shooting at some incredibly evil cans...

30
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,930
you went after her,didn't you?the crossroads demon.

31
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,360
after i told you not to.

32
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,360
yeah,well...

33
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,730
you could have gotten yourself killed!i didn't.

34
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,900
and you shot her.

35
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,200
she was a smartass.

36
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,860
so,what? does that meani'm out of my deal?

37
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,430
don't you think

38
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,930
i might have mentioned that little fact,dean?

39
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,930
no. someone else holds the contract.

40
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,360
- who?
- she wouldn't say.

41
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,260
well,we should find out who.

42
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,930
of course,our best lead would be the crossroads demon.

43
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,260
oh,wait a minute...

44
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,900
- that's not funny.
- no,it's not!

45
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,730
it was a stupid freaking risk,and you shouldn't have done it.

46
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,100
i shouldn't have done it?

47
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,500
you're my brother,dean.

48
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,300
and no matter what you do,i'm gonna try and save you.

49
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,030
and i'm sure as hell not gonnaapologize for it,all right?

50
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,460
but i don't understand.

51
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,600
i already went over all this with the other detectives.

52
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,100
right,yes.

53
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,130
but,see,we're with the sheriff's department,

54
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,830
not the police department --different departments.

55
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,760
so,mrs. case...

56
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,360
please.ms. case.

57
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,830
okay.

58
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,530
um,ms. case,um...

59
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,460
you were the one who found your niece,correct?

60
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,430
i came home,she was in the shower.

61
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,430
drowned?

62
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,260
so the coroner says.

63
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,030
now,you tell me,how can someone drown in the shower?

64
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,300
how would you describe

65
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,260
sheila's behavior in the days before her death?

66
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,260
i mean,did she seem frightened?

67
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,600
maybe she said something out of the ordinary?

68
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,500
wait a minute.

69
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,430
you're working with alex,aren't you?

70
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,300
yep. absolutely.

71
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,630
alex and us,we're like this.

72
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,330
why didn't you say so?

73
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,700
alex has been such a comfort.

74
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,660
but i'm sorry.i thought the case was solved.

75
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,460
well,no.no,not yet.

76
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,900
i see.

77
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,160
so,anyways,we were talking about your niece.

78
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,730
well,yes.

79
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,830
sheila mentioned something quite strange before she died.

80
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,730
she said she saw a boat.a boat?

81
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,530
yes. one minute it was there,then it was gone.

82
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,500
it just disappeared right before her eyes.

83
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,200
you think it could be a ghost ship?

84
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,530
alex thinks it could be a ghost ship.

85
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,400
could be.

86
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,360
you let me know if there's anything else i can do for you.

87
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,160
anything at all.

88
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,030
what a crazy,old broad.

89
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,530
why? because she believes in ghosts?

90
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,100
look at you.sticking up for your girlfriend.

91
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,060
- you cougar hound.
- bite me.

92
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,630
not if she bites you first.

93
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,260
so,who's this alex?we got another player in town?

94
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,430
maybe,maybe not.doesn't change our job.

95
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,200
and what looked like a ghost ship,right?

96
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,300
it's not the first one sighted around here,either.

97
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,400
every 37 years,like clockwork,

98
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,830
reports of a vanishing three-mast clipper ship

99
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,100
out in the bay.

100
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,960
and every 37 years,a rash of weirdo,dry-land drownings.

101
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,330
- so,whatever's happening is just getting started.
- yeah.

102
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,660
what's the lore?

103
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,560
well,there are apparitions of old wrecks

104
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,000
sighted all over the world.

105
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,450
the s.s. violet,the griffin

106
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,700
the flying dutchman

107
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,760
almost all of them are death omens.

108
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,960
so,you see the ship and then a few hours later,

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,830
you pucker up and kiss your ass goodbye?

110
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,860
basically.

111
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,230
what's the next step?

112
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,230
i got to i.d. the boat.

113
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,360
that shouldn't be too hard.

114
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,130
i mean,how many three-mast clipper ships

115
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,260
have wrecked off the coast?

116
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,200
i checked that too,actually.

117
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,060
over 150.

118
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,100
crap.

119
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,330
this is where we parked the car,right?

120
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,760
i thought so.

121
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,430
where's my car?

122
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,660
did you feed the meter?

123
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,400
yes,i fed the meter.

124
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,530
sam,where's my car?somebody stole my car!

125
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,300
calm down.

126
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,430
i am calmed down!somebody stole my ca--

127
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,700
oh,my god.

128
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,100
take it easy.

129
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,860
the '67 impala?was that yours?

130
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,860
bela

131
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,200
i'm sorry.

132
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,200
- i had that car towed.
- you what?!

133
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,200
- well,it wasin a tow-away zone.
- no,it wasn't!

134
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,230
it was when i finished with it.

135
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,200
what the hell are you even doing here?

136
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,800
a little yachting.

137
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,600
you're alex.

138
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,860
you're working with that old lady.

139
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,400
gert's a dear old friend.

140
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,400
yeah,right.what's your angle?

141
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,700
there's no angle.

142
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,200
there's a lot of lovely old women like gert

143
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,200
up and down the eastern seaboard.

144
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,630
i sell them charms,

145
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,460
perform seances so they can commune with their dead cats.

146
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,700
and let me guess,it's all a con.

147
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,760
the comfort i provide them is very real.

148
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,760
how do you sleep at night?

149
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,160
on silk sheets,rolling naked in money.

150
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,160
really,sam,i'd expect the attitude from him. but you?

151
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,060
you shot me.

152
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,630
i barely grazed you.

153
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,860
cute. but a bit of a drama queen,yeah?

154
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,260
you do know what's going on around here.

155
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,000
this ghost-ship thing,it is real.

156
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,430
i'm aware.

157
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,080
thanks for telling gert the case wasn't solved

158
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,030
by the way.

159
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,430
it isn't.

160
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,760
she didn't know that.

161
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,930
now the old bag's stopped payment

162
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,160
and she's demanding some real answers.

163
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,600
look...

164
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,790
just stay out of my way

165
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,330
before you cause any more trouble.

166
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,130
i'd get to that car if i were you...

167
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,330
before they find the arsenal in the trunk.

168
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,930
ciao.

169
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,400
can i shoot her?

170
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,330
not in public.

171
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,730
hello?

172
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,540
police said that he drowned,

173
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,340
but i don't u-understand how...

174
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,040
i am so sorry for your loss,mr. warren.

175
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,900
now,if you could just tell me one more time

176
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,340
about the ship your brother saw.

177
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,500
ma'am,i think this man's been through quite enough.

178
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,140
you should go.

179
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,640
but i just have a few more questions.

180
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,740
no,you don't.

181
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,570
thank you for your time.

182
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,470
sorry you had to deal with that. they're like roaches.

183
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,170
so,we heard you say your brother saw a ship.

184
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,740
yeah,that's right.

185
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,900
did he tell you what it looked like?

186
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,440
it was,uh... like the old yankee clippers.

187
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,300
a smuggling vessel.

188
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,970
the rakish topsail,a barkentine rigging.

189
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,900
angel figurehead on the bow.

190
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,200
that's a lot of detail for a ship your brother saw.

191
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,440
my brother and i were night diving.

192
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,940
i saw the ship,too.

193
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,470
excuse me,officers,

194
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,640
i'm not sure those men are detectives.

195
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,070
all right. well,we'll be in touch.

196
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,500
thank you.

197
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,100
i see you got your car back.

198
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,200
you really want to come near me

199
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,540
when i got a loaded gun in my hands?

200
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,840
now,now. mind your blood pressure.

201
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,540
why are you even still here?

202
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,770
you have enough to i.d. the boat?

203
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,940
that guy back there saw the ship.

204
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,940
yeah? and?

205
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,340
and he's going to die,so we have to save him.

206
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,400
how sweet.

207
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,500
you think this is funny?

208
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,740
he's cannon fodder.

209
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,300
he can't be saved in time,and you know it.

210
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,200
yeah,well,see,we have souls,so we're gonna try.

211
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,340
well,i'm actually gonna find the ship and put an end to this.

212
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,640
but you have fun.

213
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,300
hey,bela,how'd you get like this,huh?

214
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,570
what,did daddy not give you enough hugs or something?

215
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,040
i don't know. your daddy give you enough?

216
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,970
don't you dare look down your nose at me.

217
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,300
you're not better than i am.

218
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,440
we help people.

219
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,670
come on.

220
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,900
you do this out of vengeance and obsession.

221
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,400
you're a stone's throw from being a serial killer.

222
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,240
whereas i,on the other hand,

223
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,640
i get paid to do a job and i do it.

224
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,600
so,you tell me -- which is healthier?

225
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,140
bela,why don't you just leave? we've got work to do.

226
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,270
yeah. you're 0 for 2.

227
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,870
bang-up job so far.

228
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,470
anything good?

229
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,240
no. not really.

230
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,070
i mean,both brothers are duke university grads.

231
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,240
no criminal record.

232
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:04,000
i mean,a few speeding tickets.

233
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,440
they inherited their father's real estate fortune

234
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,640
six years ago.

235
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,640
- how much?
- $112 million.

236
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,970
nice life.

237
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,600
yeah. i mean,nice,clean,aboveboard.

238
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,870
so,why did they see the ship?

239
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,340
why sheila,too? what do they all have in common?

240
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,500
maybe nothing.

241
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,900
no. there's always something.

242
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,700
hey,you!

243
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,440
i think we've been made.

244
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,370
what are you guys doing?! you watching me?!

245
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,870
sir,calm down. please.

246
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,200
you guys aren't cops!

247
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,870
not dressed like that. not -- not in that crappy car.

248
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,470
whoa,hey. no need to get nasty.

249
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,240
we are cops,okay? we're undercover.

250
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,370
we're here because we think you're in danger.

251
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,440
from who?!

252
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,600
if you just settle down,we'll talk about it.

253
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,470
look,you guys just stay away from me!

254
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,400
wait.

255
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,040
hey,you moron! we're trying to help you!

256
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,670
- that can't be good.
- no.

257
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,370
get the salt gun.

258
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,040
peter!

259
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,900
sam!

260
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,900
come on.

261
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,010
you want to say it,or should i?

262
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,540
what?

263
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,540
you can't save everybody,sam.

264
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,470
yeah,right. so -- so,what? you feel better now or what?

265
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:29,910
no. not really.

266
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,740
me neither.

267
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,280
you got to under--

268
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:39,040
it's just lately i feel like i can't save anybody.

269
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,910
dear god...

270
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,470
are you actually squatting?

271
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,570
charming.

272
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,770
so,how did things go last night with peter?

273
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,240
that well,huh?

274
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,310
if you say "i told you so,"

275
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,810
i swear to god,i'll start swinging.

276
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,140
look,i think the three of us should have a heart-to-heart.

277
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,380
that's assuming you have a heart.

278
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,240
dean,please.

279
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,970
i'm sorry about what i said before,okay?

280
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,110
i come bearing gifts.

281
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,710
such as?

282
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,940
i've i.d.'d the ship.

283
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:11,070
it's the espirito santo,a merchant sailing vessel.

284
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,240
quite a colorful history.

285
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,010
in 1859,a sailor was accused of treason.

286
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,740
he was tried aboard ship in a kangaroo court and hanged.

287
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:19,910
he was 37.

288
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,240
which would explain the 37-year cycle.

289
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,710
aren't you a sharp tack?

290
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,740
there's a photo of him somewhere.

291
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,010
here.

292
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,240
isn't that the customer we saw last night?

293
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,010
you saw him?

294
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,510
yeah,that's him. except he was missing a hand.

295
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,070
- his right hand.
- how did you know?

296
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,610
the sailor's body was cremated,

297
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,810
but not before they cut off his hand to make a hand of glory.

298
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,010
a hand of glory?

299
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,770
i think i got one of those

300
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,010
at the end of my thai massage last week.

301
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,540
dean,the right hand of a hanged man

302
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,110
is a serious occult object.

303
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,310
it's very powerful. so they say.

304
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,910
and officially counts as remains.

305
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,610
none of this explains why the ghost is choosing these victims.

306
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,640
i'll tell you why. who cares?

307
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:05,110
find the hand,burn it,and stop the bloody thing.

308
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,910
i don't get it. why are you telling us all this?

309
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,140
because i know exactly where the hand is.

310
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,910
- where?
- at the sea pines museum.

311
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,540
it's a macabre bit of maritime history.

312
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,310
but i need help.

313
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,440
what kind of help?

314
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,640
what is taking so long?

315
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,610
sam's already halfway there.

316
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,910
with his date.

317
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,440
i'm so not okay with this.

318
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,470
what are you,a woman?

319
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,210
come down,already.

320
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,440
all right. get it out. i look ridiculous.

321
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,840
not exactly the word i'd use.

322
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,640
what?

323
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,640
you know,when this is over,

324
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,640
we should really have angry sex.

325
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,310
don't objectify me.

326
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,640
let's go.

327
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,410
are you chewing gum?

328
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,310
try to behave as if you've lived this life before.

329
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,640
yeah?

330
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,240
this will get their tongues wagging,eh,my adonis?

331
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,340
just remember,we're on business.

332
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,540
oh,but sometimes business can be pleasure,hmm?

333
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,010
right.

334
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,970
you know,uh,could you excuse me for a moment?

335
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,910
great. thanks. thanks.

336
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,770
exactly how long do you expect me to entertain my date?

337
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,670
as long as it takes.

338
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,670
look,there's security all over this place,all right?

339
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,740
this is an uncrashable party without gert's invitation,so...

340
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:56,970
we can crash anything,dean.

341
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,340
yeah,i know.

342
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,710
but this is easier,and it's a lot more entertaining.

343
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:04,170
you know there are limits to what i'll do,right?

344
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,570
aw,he's playing hard-to-get. that's cute.

345
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:11,170
come on.

346
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,280
i want all the details in the morning.

347
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,670
to us.

348
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,610
private security?

349
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,110
i don't think so.

350
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,540
look at the way they're standing.

351
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,870
they're pros.

352
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,540
probably state troopers moonlighting.

353
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:01,970
posted to every door,too.

354
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,280
yeah.

355
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,610
i don't think we're gonna be able to just waltz upstairs.

356
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,540
what do you suggest?

357
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:10,110
i'm thinking.

358
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,010
don't strain yourself.

359
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,070
interesting,how the legend is so much more than the man.

360
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:20,840
you got any bright ideas,i'm all ears.

361
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,210
okay.

362
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:29,040
honey? honey? are you all right?

363
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,140
waiter...

364
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,970
hi,uh,my wife has a severe shellfish allergy.

365
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,840
- there's no crab in that?
- no,sir.

366
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,280
no?

367
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,170
oh,they're excellent,by the way.

368
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,870
what seems to be the trouble?

369
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,770
uh,the champagne.

370
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,010
my wife she's a lightweight when it comes to the sauce.

371
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,040
is there somewhere i can lay her down

372
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,910
till she gets her sea legs back?

373
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,210
follow me.

374
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,240
right.

375
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,670
thank you.

376
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,310
come on,you lush.

377
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,640
you think she's a pain in the ass now,

378
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,240
try living with her.

379
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,640
thank you very much.

380
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,770
hey,maybe next time give me a little heads-up with your plan.

381
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,240
i didn't want you thinking.

382
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,240
you're not very good at that.

383
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:28,110
oh,look at you. searching for a witty rejoinder?

384
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,440
screw you.

385
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,510
very oscar wilde.

386
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,570
room 235.

387
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,070
it's in a locked glass case wired for alarm.

388
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,040
i'm sure that won't be a problem.

389
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,010
where's alex and your friend?

390
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,710
they're missing a great party.

391
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,510
i'm,uh i'm sure they're entertaining themselves.

392
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,710
naughty.

393
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,280
then i guess we'll just have to entertain ourselves.

394
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,810
y-you know,um,mrs. case...

395
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,470
i'm sorry.

396
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,810
ms. case,i don't want to give you the wrong idea.

397
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,810

398
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,870
okay.

399
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,210
you remind me of my late husband.

400
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,770
he was shy,too.

401
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,840
till we got belowdeck.

402
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:38,940
you're just firm all over.

403
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,070
sir? ma'am?

404
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,040
everything all right?

405
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,210
hi.

406
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,740
feeling better,i see?

407
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:39,540
yes. much. thank you.

408
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,280
so if you're...done with the room?

409
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:45,380
well,not exactly.

410
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,940
could we have a few more minutes?

411
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,710
uh,yes,ma'am.

412
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,540
stop it. that tickles.

413
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,840
sorry.

414
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,840
it's,uh... nature called.

415
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,170
thanks for looking after my wife.

416
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,170
oh,she's being looked after,all right.

417
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,210
any trouble?

418
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,640
nothing i couldn't handle.

419
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,840
the hand?

420
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,910
may i?

421
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,170
no.

422
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:37,940
it might be more inconspicuous in my purse.

423
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,610
nice try.

424
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,740
just trying to be helpful.

425
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:45,610
well,sweetheart,i don't need your kind of help.

426
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,910
man,this is one long song.

427
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,540
i hope it never ends.

428
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,640
how's the investigation going?

429
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:03,170
these things take time.

430
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,440
people are talking about the warren brothers' deaths.

431
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,280
strange.

432
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:12,010
do you think it's connected to sheila's?

433
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,840
yeah. yeah,we think so.

434
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,940
i think they had it coming,you know,

435
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,570
in a biblical sort of way.

436
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,210
what do you mean?

437
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,570
you know about their father.

438
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,310
no.

439
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,610
come here. i'll whisper it to you.

440
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,770
people say...

441
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:37,040
that the old man didn't die of natural causes.

442
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,210
then how?

443
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,340
rumor is the boys did it.

444
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:47,470
nothing was ever proved,but people still whisper.

445
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,710
o-okay,okay.

446
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:52,010
so,did did sheila have any connection to them?

447
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,070
well,none that i know of.

448
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,510
did sheila have any kind of tragedy in her life?

449
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,510
yes.

450
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,110
as a matter of fact,

451
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,040
there was a car accident when she was a teenager.

452
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,380
what happened?

453
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,510
her car flipped over.

454
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:10,870
well,she was okay,but her cousin brian was killed.

455
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,470
why? is that important?

456
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,070
having a nice time?

457
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:21,310
he's delightful.

458
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,340
he wants me.

459
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,510
i'm going to get gert into a cold shower.

460
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,040
great idea.

461
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,640
see you at the cemetery.

462
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,810
you stink like sex.

463
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,140
you got it,right?

464
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:56,440
tell me i didn't get groped all night by mrs. havisham for nothing.

465
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,210
i got it.mrs. who?

466
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,840
never mind.just let me see it.

467
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,410
what?

468
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,870
i'm gonna kill her.

469
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,280
oh,no.

470
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,050
you know what?you're right.

471
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,650
i'm not gonna kill her.

472
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,850
i think slow torture's the way to go.

473
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,550
dean,look,you got to relax.

474
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,780
relax?! oh,yeah.yeah,i'll relax.

475
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,320
you.

476
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,820
what?

477
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:19,480
i-i mean,she got one over on you,not us.

478
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,950
thank you,sam!it's very helpful!

479
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:31,780
hello? could you open up?

480
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,650
just let me explain.

481
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,580
i sold it.

482
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,320
i had a buyer lined up  as soon as i knew it existed.

483
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:51,750
so,the whole reason for us going to the charity ball was...

484
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,990
i needed a cover.

485
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,390
you were convenient.

486
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,580
look,you sold it to a buyer.just go buy it back.

487
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,420
it's halfway across the ocean.i can't get it back in time.

488
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,550
in time for what?

489
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,520
what's going on with you,bela?

490
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,650
you look like you've seen a ghost.

491
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,020
i saw the ship.

492
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,820
you what?

493
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,320
i-i knew you were an immoral,thieving,con-artist bitch,

494
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:25,050
but just when i thought my opinion of you couldn't get any lower...

495
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,290
what are you talking about?

496
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,390
we figured out the spirit's motive.

497
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:36,150
this is the captain of our ship,

498
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,880
the one who hung our ghost boy.

499
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,780
so?

500
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,250
so,they were brothers.

501
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,290
so,now our spirit,

502
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,990
he's going after a very specific kind of target --

503
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,320
people who've spilled their own  family's blood.

504
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,250
see,first,there was sheila,

505
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,750
who killed her cousin in a car accident.

506
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,090
and the warren brothers,

507
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,650
who murdered their father for the inheritance.

508
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,950
and now you.

509
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,020
my god.

510
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:08,350
so,who was it,bela?hmm?

511
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,150
who'd you kill?

512
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,480
was it daddy?

513
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,220
your little sis,maybe?

514
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,620
it's none of your business.

515
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,920
no.

516
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,290
right.

517
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,250
well,have a nice life --you know,whatever's left of it.

518
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,650
sam,let's go.

519
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,120
you can't just leave me here.

520
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,020
watch us.

521
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,450
please.

522
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,190
i need your help.

523
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,290
our help?

524
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,620
well,now,

525
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:45,220
how could a couple of serial killers possibly help you?

526
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,850
okay,that was a bit harsh,i admit it.

527
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,550
but it doesn't warrant a death sentence.

528
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,250
that's not why you're gonna die.

529
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,880
what did you do,bela?

530
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,680
you wouldn't understand.

531
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,420
no one did.

532
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,320
never mind.

533
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,450
i'll just do what i've always done.

534
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,480
i'll deal with it myself.

535
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,780
you do realize

536
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,290
you just sold the only thing that could save your life.

537
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,550
i'm aware.

538
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,880
well...

539
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,620
...maybe not the only thing.

540
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,090
do you really think this is gonna work?

541
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,090
almost definitely not.

542
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:08,620
sammy,you better start reading.

543
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:37,090
stay close!

544
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,850
behind you!

545
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:12,880
sam,read faster!

546
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,650
you...hanged me!

547
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,250
i'm sorry.

548
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,150
your own brother!

549
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,120
i'm so sorry.

550
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,420
you boys should learn to lock your doors.

551
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,720
anyone could just barge in.

552
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,690
anyone just did.

553
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,120
did you come to say goodbye or thank you?

554
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,460
i've come to settle affairs.

555
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:43,560
giving the spirit what he really wanted -- his own brother.

556
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,990
very clever,sam.

557
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,220
it's $10,000. that should cover it.

558
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,190
i don't like being in anyone's debt.

559
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,590
so,ponying up 10 grand is easier for you

560
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,960
than a simple thank you?

561
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,020
you're so damaged.

562
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,820
takes one to know one.

563
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,190
goodbye,lads.

564
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,520
she got style. you got to give her that.

565
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,060
i suppose.

566
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,890
you know,dean,we don't know where this money's been.

567
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,360
no...

568
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,090
...but i know where it's going.

569
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,060

570
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,520

571
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,060
hell yeah.

572
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:40,160
play some roulette. always bet on black.

573
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,320
hey,listen,i've been doing some thinking.

574
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,060
um,i want you to know i understand why you did it.

575
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,790
i understand why you went after the crossroads demon.

576
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,090
you know,situation was reversed,

577
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,320
i guess i'd have done the same thing.

578
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,790
i mean,i'm not blind.

579
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:04,120
i see what you're going through with this whole deal

580
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,720
me going away and all that.

581
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,760
but you're gonna be okay.

582
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,820
you think so.

583
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,590
yeah. you'll keep hunting.

584
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,890
you know,you'll live your life.

585
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,320
you're stronger than me. you are.

586
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,260
you are. you'll get over it.

587
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,720
but i want you to know i'm sorry.

588
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,920
i'm sorry for putting you through all this.

589
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,020
you know what,dean? go screw yourself.

590
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,290
what?

591
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,320
i don't want an apology from you.

592
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,120
and by the way,i'm a big boy now.

593
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,790
- i can take care of myself.
- oh,well,excuse me.

594
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,460
so would you please quit worrying about me?

595
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,120
that's the whole problem in the first place!

596
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,260
i don't want you to worry about me,dean.

597
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:45,090
i want you to worry about you.

598
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,920
i want you to give a crap that you're dying!

599
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,560
so,that's it? nothing else to say for you?

600
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,390
