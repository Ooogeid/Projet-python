1
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,530
Merry christmas, grandpa.

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,960
Oh, merry christmas to you, stevie.

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,900
Did you bring me any presents?

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,760
Now, why would i want to do that?

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,960
'Cause it's christmas.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,500
Oh, i thought santa claus

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,400
Brought the presents at christmas.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,930
You have been a good boy
this year, haven't you?

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,960
I have, i swear.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,300
Well, then, who
knows?Maybe he'll come.

11
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,860
Santa!

12
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,160
Reindeer.

13
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,130
Santa?

14
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,500
Um, my daughter and
i were in our beds.

15
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,460
Mike was downstairs
decorating the tree.

16
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,830
I heard a thump on the roof,

17
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,100
And then i-I heard mike scream,

18
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,400
And now i'm talking to the fbi.

19
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,530
And you didn't see any of it?

20
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,930
No, he was... he was just gone.

21
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,000
The doors were locked?There
was no forced entry?

22
00:02:45,035 --> 00:02:46,000
That's right.

23
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,530
Does anybody else
have a key?My parents.

24
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,200
Where do they live?

25
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,660
Florida.

26
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,960
Thanks for letting me have
a look around, mrs. Walsh.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,360
I think we, uh, got just
about everything we need.

28
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,130
We're all set.

29
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,630
We'll be in touch.

30
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,260
Agents...

31
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,360
T
- The police said my husband might have been kidnapped.

32
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,730
Could be.

33
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,500
Then why haven't
the kidnappers called

34
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,730
O- Or - Or
demanded a ransom?

35
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,900
It's three days till christmas.

36
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,530
What am i supposed
to tell our daughter?

37
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,460
We're very sorry.

38
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,360
Find anything?

39
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,300
Stockings, mistletoe... this.

40
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,260
A tooth?Where was this?

41
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,860
In the chimney.

42
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,130
No way a man fits up a
chimney. It's too narrow.

43
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,730
No way he fits up in one piece.

44
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,860
All right, so, if dad
went up the chimney -

45
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,060
We need to find out what
dragged him up there.

46
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,960
So, was i right?

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,530
Is it the serial-Killing
chimney sweep?

48
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,700
Yep.

49
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,300
It's, uh, it's
actually dick van dyke.

50
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,230
Who?

51
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,030
"Mary poppins. "Who's that?

52
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,430
Oh, come on -Never mind.

53
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,360
It turns out that walsh
is the second guy in town

54
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,300
Grabbed out of his
house this month.

55
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,530
Oh, yeah?Yeah.

56
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,560
The other guy get dragged
up the chimney, too?

57
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,800
Don't know. Witnesses said
they heard a thump on the roof.

58
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,560
So, what the hell do you
think we're dealing with?

59
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,860
Actually, i have an idea. Yeah?

60
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,560
It's, uh, it's gonna sound crazy.

61
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,960
What could you possibly
say that sounds crazy to me?

62
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,730
Evil santa.

63
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,630
Yeah, that's crazy.

64
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,630
Yeah... i mean, i'm just saying

65
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,160
That there's some version of
the anti-Claus in every culture.

66
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,230
You got belsnickel,
krampus, black peter.

67
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,960
Whatever you want to call
it, there's all sorts of lore.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,230
Saying what?

69
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,330
Saying back in the day,
santa's brother went rogue,

70
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,930
And now he shows up
around christmastime.

71
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,930
Instead of bringing presents,
he punishes the wicked.

72
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,330
By hauling their ass up chimneys?

73
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,830
For starters, yeah.

74
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,800
So, this is your theory,
huh? Santa's shady brother?

75
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,760
Well, i'm just saying,
that's what the lore says.

76
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,630
Santa doesn't have a
brother. There is no santa.

77
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah, i know.

78
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,260
You're the one who told
me that in the first place

79
00:05:02,295 --> 00:05:03,260
Remember?

80
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,730
Yeah, you know
what?I could be wrong.

81
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,100
I...

82
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,460
...got to be wrong.

83
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,100
Maybe, maybe not.

84
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,030
What?

85
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,960
I did a little digging
- Turns out both victims

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Visited the same place
before they got snatched.

87
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,230
Where?

88
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,300
It does kind of lend credence
to the theory, don't it?

89
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,400
Yeah, but anti-Claus?

90
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,100
Couldn't be.

91
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,630
It's a christmas miracle.

92
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,130
Hey, speaking of, we
should have one this year.

93
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,330
Have one what?A christmas.

94
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,800
No, thanks.

95
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,260
No, we'll get a tree,
a little boston market -

96
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,000
Just like when we were little.

97
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,730
Dean, those weren't exactly
hallmark memories for me.

98
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,860
What are you talking about?

99
00:05:57,895 --> 00:05:58,960
We had some great christmases.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,500
Whose childhood are
you talking about?

101
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,300
Oh, come on, sam.

102
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,100
No, just... no.

103
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,660
All right, grinch.

104
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,900
What is that?

105
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,560
A present for dad.

106
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,500
Yeah, right.

107
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,660
Where'd you get
the money -Steal it?

108
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,160
No. Uncle bobby gave
it to me to give to him.

109
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,730
Said it was real special.

110
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,000
What is it?

111
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,360
A pony.

112
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,700
Very funny.

113
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,360
Dad's gonna be here, right?

114
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,800
He'll be here.

115
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,530
It's christmas.

116
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,060
He knows.

117
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,060
And he'll be here -Promise.

118
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,400
Where is he, anyway?

119
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,460
On business.

120
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,760
What kind of business?

121
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,460
You know that.

122
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,130
He sells stuff.

123
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,630
What kind of stuff?Stuff.

124
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,430
Nobody ever tells me anything.

125
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,430
Then quit asking.

126
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,960
Is dad a spy?

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,060
Mm-Hmm. He's james bond.

128
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,160
Why do we move around so much?

129
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,130
'Cause everywhere we go,
they get sick of your face.

130
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,630
I'm old enough, dean.
You can tell me the truth.

131
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,330
You don't want to know
the truth. Believe me.

132
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,260
Is that why we never
talk about... mom?

133
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,430
Shut up!

134
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,400
<i>Don't you ever talk about mom
- Ever!</i>

135
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,730
Wait. Where are you going?

136
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,730
Out.

137
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,530
You'd think with the 10 bucks
it costs to get into this place,

138
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,900
Santa could scrounge
up a little snow.

139
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,830
What?

140
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,530
Nothing. What are we
looking for, again?

141
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,560
Lore says that the anti-Claus

142
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,900
Will walk with a limp
and smell like sweets.

143
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,230
Great. So we're looking
for a pimp santa.

144
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,600
Why the sweets?

145
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,360
Think about it, dean.

146
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,525
If you smell like candy

147
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,260
The kids will come
closer, you know?

148
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,100
That's creepy.

149
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,560
How does this thing know

150
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,000
Who's been naughty
and who's been nice?

151
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,760
I don't know.

152
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,460
So, ronny, come
sit on santa's knee.

153
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,760
Ah, there you go.

154
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,030
You been a good boy this year?Yeah

155
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,530
Good.

156
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,330
Santa's got a special gift for you

157
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,300
Maybe we do

158
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,000
Welcome to santa's court.

159
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,530
Can i escort your child to santa?

160
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,100
N
- No. No.

161
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,930
Uh, but, actually,
my brother here -

162
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,330
It's been a lifelong dream of his.

163
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,560
Uh, sorry. No kids over... 12.

164
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,200
No, he's just kidding. We
only came here to watch.

165
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,560
I- I didn't mean that
we came here to w-Y

166
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,160
Thanks a lot, dean.
Thanks for that.

167
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,830
Check it out.

168
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,630
Are you seeing this?

169
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,730
A lot of people walk
with limps, right?

170
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,300
Tell me you didn't smell
that. That was candy, man.

171
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,600
That was ripple
- I think. Had to be.

172
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,030
Maybe. We willing
to take that chance?

173
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,530
What time is it?

174
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,230
Same as the last time you asked.

175
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,130
Here.

176
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,760
Caffeinate.

177
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,760
Wonderful.

178
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,460
Hey, sam...

179
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,300
Yeah?

180
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,830
Why are you the boy
that hates christmas?

181
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,760
Dean... i mean, i admit it -

182
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,330
We had a few bumpy holidays
when we were kids. "Bumpy"?

183
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,930
That was then. We'll
do it right this year.

184
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,260
Look, dean, if you
want to have christmas

185
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:38,860
Knock yourself out.

186
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,560
Just don't involve me.

187
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,100
Oh, yeah, that'd be great -

188
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,430
Me and myself making
cranberry molds.

189
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,600
What's up with saint nicotine?

190
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,300
What?

191
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,560
Nothing.

192
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,900
It's just that,
uh... well, you know,

193
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,160
Mr. Gung ho christmas might
have to blow away santa.

194
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,660
What the hell are you doing here?

195
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,200
I'm really not interested, okay?

196
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,330
Jingle my bells...

197
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,230
S
- Silent night

198
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,830
Holy...

199
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,730
...night... night

200
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,700
* all is well * all is well

201
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,830
* all is dry

202
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,000
* bright

203
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,160
* 'round and 'round

204
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,260
* the table...

205
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,360
Santa, you're early!

206
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,300
So, that's how your son
described the attack?

207
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,200
"Santa took daddy up the chimney"?

208
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,130
That's what he says, yes.

209
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,500
And where were you?

210
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,730
I was asleep.

211
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,000
And all of a sudden...

212
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,230
...i was being dragged
out of bed, screaming.

213
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,300
Did you see the attacker?

214
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,430
It was dark, and he hit me.

215
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,700
He knocked me out.

216
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,260
I'm sorry. I know this is hard.

217
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,400
Yeah... um, mrs. Caldwell,

218
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,730
Where did you get that
wreath above the fireplace?

219
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,160
Excuse me?

220
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,730
Just curious, you know.

221
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,830
Wreaths, huh?

222
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,730
Sure you didn't want to
ask her about her shoes?

223
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,630
I saw some nice
handbags in the foyer.

224
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,930
We've seen that
wreath before, dean.

225
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,000
Where?

226
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,630
The walshes'.Yesterday.

227
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,100
I know, i was just testing you.

228
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,400
Yeah. All right. Well,
keep looking, would you?

229
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,960
Thanks, bobby.

230
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,430
What did bobby say?

231
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,400
Uh, that we're morons.

232
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,830
He also said

233
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,500
That it was probably
meadowsweet in those wreaths.

234
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,600
Wow! Amazing.

235
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,430
What the hell is meadowsweet?

236
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,830
It's pretty rare,

237
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,800
And it's probably the most
powerful plant in pagan lore.

238
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,960
Pagan lore? Yeah.

239
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,660
See, they used meadowsweet
for human sacrifices.

240
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,130
It was kind of like
a... chum for their gods.

241
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,430
Gods were drawn to
it, and they'd stop by

242
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,200
And snack on whatever
was the nearest human.

243
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,330
Why would somebody be using
that for christmas wreaths?

244
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,300
It's not as crazy
as it sounds, dean.

245
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,030
I mean, pretty much every
christmas tradition is pagan.

246
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,960
Christmas is jesus' birthday.

247
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,430
No, jesus' birthday was
probably in the fall.

248
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,800
It was actually the
winter solstice festival

249
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,130
That was co-Opted by the
church and renamed "christmas. "

250
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,330
But the yule log, the
tree, even santa's red suit

251
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,960
That's all remnants
of pagan worship.

252
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,430
How do you know that?

253
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,900
What are you gonna tell me next?

254
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,660
Easter bunny's jewish?

255
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,730
So, you think we're
dealing with a pagan god?

256
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,860
Yeah, probably hold nickar,
god of the winter solstice.

257
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,030
And all these martha
stewart wannabes,

258
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,830
Buying these fancy wreaths...

259
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,600
It's pretty much like putting
a neon sign on your front door

260
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,700
Saying, "come kill us. "

261
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,300
Great.

262
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,400
When you sacrifice to hold nickar,

263
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,400
Guess what he gives you in return.

264
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,800
Lap dances, hopefully.

265
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,130
Mild weather.

266
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,460
Like no snow in the
middle of december

267
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,260
In the middle of
michigan. For instance.

268
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,730
Do we know how to kill it yet?

269
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,360
No, bobby's working
on that right now.

270
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,700
We got to figure out where
they're selling those wreaths.

271
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,300
You think they're
selling them on purpose?

272
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,500
Feeding the victims to this thing?

273
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,400
Let's find out.

274
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,360
Help you boys?

275
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,830
Uh, hope so.

276
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,900
Uh, we were playing jenga with
the walshes the other night,

277
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,800
And he hasn't shut up since
about this christmas wreath.

278
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,800
I don't know. You tell him.

279
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,660
Sure.

280
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,900
It was yummy.

281
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,360
I sell a lot of wreaths, guys.

282
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,430
Right, right, but you see,

283
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,400
This one would have
been really special.

284
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,560
It had, uh, it had, uh, green
leaves, um, white buds on it.

285
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,930
It might have been made
of, uh, meadowsweet?

286
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,530
Well... aren't you a fussy one?

287
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,260
He is.

288
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,160
Anyway, i know the one
you're talking about.

289
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,600
I'm all out.

290
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,930
Seems like this meadowsweet
stuff's rare and expensive.

291
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,400
Why make wreaths out of it?

292
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,100
Beats me. I didn't make them.

293
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,300
Who did?

294
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,660
Madge carrigan a local lady.

295
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,460
Said the wreaths were so
special, she gave them for free.

296
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,430
She didn't charge you? Nope.

297
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,930
Did you sell them for free?

298
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,160
Hell, no. It's christmas.

299
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,000
People pay a buttload
for this crap.

300
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,100
That's the spirit.

301
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,200
How much do you think a
meadowsweet wreath would cost?

302
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,130
A couple hundred dollars, at least.

303
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,230
This lady's giving
them away for free?

304
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,930
What do you think about that?

305
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,730
Well, sounds pretty suspicious.

306
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,230
Remember that wreath dad
brought home that one year?

307
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,360
Do you mean the one he stole
from, like, a liquor store?

308
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,800
Yeah, it was a bunch
of empty beer cans.

309
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,360
That thing was great.

310
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,530
I bet if i looked
around hard enough,

311
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,160
I could probably
find one just like it.

312
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,530
All right...

313
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,400
Dude...

314
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,500
What's going on with you? What?

315
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,000
I mean, since when are you
bing crosby all of a sudden?

316
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,200
Why do you want to
do christmas so bad?

317
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,000
Why are you so against it?

318
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,800
Were your childhood
memories that traumatic?

319
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,300
No, that has nothing to do with it.

320
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,130
Then what?

321
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,960
I mean, i-I just
- I don't get it.

322
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,160
You haven't talked
about christmas in years.

323
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,660
Well, yeah.

324
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,600
This is my last year.

325
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,800
I know.

326
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,300
That's why i can't.

327
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,500
What do you mean?

328
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:35,730
I mean i can't just sit around,

329
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,960
Drinking eggnog,
pretending everything's okay

330
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,700
When i know next
christmas you'll be dead.

331
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,960
I just can't.

332
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,430
Thought you went out.

333
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,800
Yeah. To get you dinner.

334
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,060
Don't forget your vegetables.

335
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,360
I know why you keep a
gun under your pillow.

336
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,230
No, you don't. Stay
out of my stuff.

337
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,960
And i know why we lay
salt down everywhere we go.

338
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,360
No, you don't. Shut up.

339
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,560
Where'd you get that? That's dad's!

340
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,800
He's gonna kick your
ass for reading that.

341
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,260
Are monsters real?

342
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,260
What?You're crazy.

343
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,260
Tell me.

344
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,200
I swear, if you ever tell
dad i told you any of this,

345
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,760
I will end you.

346
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,400
Promise.

347
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,200
Well, the first
thing you have to know

348
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:21,200
Is we have the coolest
dad in the world.

349
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,930
He's a superhero.

350
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,200
He is? Yeah.

351
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,760
Monsters are real.

352
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,030
Dad fights them.

353
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,830
He's fighting them right now.

354
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,760
But dad said the monsters
under my bed weren't real.

355
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,060
That's 'cause he had
already checked under there.

356
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,600
But, yeah, they're real.

357
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,200
Almost everything's real.

358
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,800
Is santa real?

359
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,100
No.

360
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,560
If monsters are real,
then they could get us.

361
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,300
They could get me. Dad's
not gonna let them get you.

362
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,630
But what if they get him?

363
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,060
They aren't gonna get dad.

364
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,000
Dad's, like, the best.

365
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,100
I read in dad's book
that they got mom.

366
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,560
It's complicated, sam.

367
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,400
If they got mom, they can get dad.

368
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:17,730
And if they get
dad, they can get us.

369
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,830
It's not like that.

370
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,560
Okay, dad's fine.

371
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,300
We're fine.

372
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,830
Trust me.

373
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,500
You okay?

374
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,830
Yeah.

375
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,360
Hey, dad's gonna be
here for christmas...

376
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,000
Just like he always is.

377
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,530
I just want to go to sleep, okay?

378
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,560
Yeah, okay.

379
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,000
It'll all be better
when you wake up.

380
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,160
You'll see.

381
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,230
Promise.

382
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,830
This is where mrs.
Wreath lives, huh?

383
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:36,330
Can't you just feel
the evil pagan vibe?

384
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,730
Yes?

385
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,560
Please tell me you're the madge carrigan
who makes the meadowsweet wreaths.

386
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,130
Why, yes, i am.

387
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,260
Ha! Bingo.

388
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,200
Well, we were just
admiring your wreaths

389
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,900
In mr. Sylar's place the other day.

390
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,130
You were?

391
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,800
Well, isn't that meadowsweet

392
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,760
Just the finest-Smelling
thing you ever smelled?

393
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,100
It sure is.

394
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,560
But the problem is, is all
your wreaths had sold out

395
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,360
Before we got the chance
to buy one. Oh, fudge!

396
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,730
You wouldn't have another one
that we could buy from you?

397
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,060
No, i'm afraid those were the
only ones i had for this season.

398
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,430
Tell me something -

399
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,860
Why did you decide to make
them out of meadowsweet?

400
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,930
Why, the smell, of course!

401
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,200
I don't think i've ever
smelled anything finer.

402
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,900
Yeah, um, you mentioned that.

403
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,600
What's going on, honey?

404
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,900
Well, just some nice boys
asking about my wreaths, dear.

405
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,100
Oh, the wreaths are
fine. Fine wreaths.

406
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,300
Oh, care for some peanut brittle?

407
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,730
We're okay.

408
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,930
I knew it!

409
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,100
Something was way
off with those two.

410
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,230
What'd you find?

411
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,630
The carrigans lived
in seattle last year,

412
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,430
Where two abductions took
place right around christmas.

413
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,300
They moved here in january.

414
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,960
All that christmas crap in their
house wasn't boughs of holly.

415
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,460
It was vervain and mint.

416
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,700
Pagan stuff? Serious pagan stuff.

417
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,860
So, what, ozzie and harriet
are keeping a pagan god

418
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,300
Hidden underneath their
plastic-Covered couch?

419
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,830
I don't know. We got
to check them out.

420
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,330
So, what about bobby?

421
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,330
He's sure evergreen stakes
will kill this thing, right?

422
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,760
Yeah, he's sure.

423
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,460
See? Plastic.

424
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,630
Hey, dean.

425
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,430
Sam!

426
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:03,230
Gosh, i wish you boys
hadn't come down here.

427
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,760
Dean?

428
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,130
You okay?

429
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,860
Yeah, i think so.

430
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,130
So, i guess we're dealing
with mr. And mrs. God.

431
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,200
Nice to know.

432
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:39,200
Ooh, and here we
thought you two lazybones

433
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,360
Were gonna sleep straight
through all the fun stuff.

434
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,800
Miss all this? Nah, we're partyers.

435
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,630
Isn't he a kick in
the pants, honey?

436
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,860
You're hunters is what you are.

437
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,360
And you're pagan gods.

438
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,130
So, why don't we just call it
even and go our separate ways?

439
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,860
So you can bring more
hunters and kill us?

440
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,800
I don't think so!

441
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,030
You should have thought about
that before snacking on humans.

442
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,760
Oh, now, don't get all wet.

443
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,260
Oh, why, we used to take over
a hundred tributes a year.

444
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,760
And that's a fact.

445
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,860
Now what do we take?
What, two? Three?

446
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,860
Hardy boys here make five.

447
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,730
Now, that's not so bad, is it?

448
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,230
You say it like that, you
guys are the cunninghams.

449
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,360
You, mister, better
show us a little respect.

450
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,230
Or what? You'll eat us?

451
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,260
Not so fast.

452
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,900
There's rituals to
be followed first.

453
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,160
Oh, we're just
sticklers for ritual.

454
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,160
And you know what kicks
off the whole shebang?

455
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,060
Let me guess -Meadowsweet.

456
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,230
Oh, shucks -You're
all out of wreaths.

457
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,560
I guess we'll just have to
cancel the sacrifice, huh?

458
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,730
Oh, don't be such a gloomy gus.

459
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,730
There.

460
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,630
Don't they just look darling?

461
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,160
Good enough to eat.

462
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,700
All righty-Roo. Step number two.

463
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,130
Sammy.

464
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,960
Sammy!

465
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,260
D
- Don't!

466
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,400
Leave him alone,
you son of a bitch!

467
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,800
Hear how they talk to us? To gods?

468
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:13,960
Listen, pal, back in the day,
we were worshiped by millions.

469
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,430
Times have changed!
Tell me about it.

470
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,330
All of a sudden, this jesus character
is the hot new thing in town.

471
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,630
All of a sudden, our altars
are being burned down,

472
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,900
And we're being hunted
down like common monsters.

473
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:28,400
But did we say a peep?
Oh, no, no, no, we did not.

474
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,430
Two millennium.

475
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:34,460
We kept a low profile.
We got jobs, a mortgage.

476
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,060
We -What was that word, dear?

477
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,460
We assimilated.

478
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,530
Yeah, we assimilated.

479
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,200
Why, we play bridge on
tuesdays and fridays.

480
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,960
We're just like everybody else.

481
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,100
You're not blending in as
smooth as you think, lady.

482
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:49,200
This might pinch a bit, dear.

483
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,030
You bitch!

484
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,730
Oh, my goodness me!

485
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,260
Somebody owes a nickel
to the swear jar.

486
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,160
Oh, do you know what i say
when i feel like swearing?

487
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,800
"Fudge. "

488
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,030
I'll try and remember that!

489
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,030
You boys have no idea
how lucky you are.

490
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,730
There was a time when
kids came from miles around

491
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,600
Just to be sitting where you are.

492
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:11,700
What do you think
you're doing with those?

493
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:14,500
You fudging touch me again,
i'll fudging kill you!

494
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,000
Very good.

495
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,160
No, don't.

496
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,260
Oh, we've got a winner!

497
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,160
What else, dear?

498
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,660
Well, let's see. Uh,
fingernail, blood...

499
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,500
I forgot the tooth!

500
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,760
Oh, dear!

501
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,660
Merry christmas, sam.

502
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,830
Open wide... and say, "ahh. "

503
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,530
Somebody gonna get that?

504
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,060
You should get that.

505
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,660
Come on.

506
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:32,760
Merry christmas!

507
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,660
I told you i smelled fruitcake.

508
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,230
You shouldn't have.

509
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,800
Oh, bite your tongue.
It's my pleasure.

510
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,060
It looks scrumptious!

511
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,200
Neal and i are going
caroling. You care to join?

512
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,430
You know, we would...

513
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,400
It's my back
- Darn thing's giving me fits.

514
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,060
Oh, well, that's a shame.

515
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,230
- Oh, well. Merry christmas.
- And to you, too, dear.

516
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,200
- Hey, are we still on for bridge tomorrow?
- With bells on!

517
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,330
- Yes! Okay,
bye. -Bye-Bye.

518
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,100
Now, where were we?

519
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,930
What do we do now?!

520
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,230
The evergreen stake's
in the basement!

521
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,260
Well, we need more evergreen, dean!

522
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,930
I think i just found us some more.

523
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,700
Help me get this.

524
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:32,760
Go!

525
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,900
Come on!

526
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,830
You little thing...

527
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,830
I loved that tree.

528
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,400
Madge!

529
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,400
Merry christmas.

530
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,000
Sam, wake up.

531
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,000
Dad was here. Look what he brought.

532
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,060
Dad was here?

533
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,030
Yeah. Look at this.
We made a killing.

534
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:26,200
Why didn't he try to wake me up?

535
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:29,500
He tried to, like a thousand times.

536
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,600
He did?

537
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,330
Yeah. Did i tell you he would
give us christmas or what?

538
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,860
Go on, dive in.

539
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,330

00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,400
Sapphire barbie?

541
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:59,600
Dad probably thinks you're a girl.

542
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,660
Shut up.

543
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,130
Open that one.

544
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,630
Dad never showed, did he?

545
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,360
Yeah, he did, i swear.

546
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,430
Dean... where'd you
get all this stuff?

547
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,300
Nice house up the block.

548
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,530
I swear i didn't know
they were chick presents.

549
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,960
Look, i'm sure dad would
have been here if he could.

550
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,800
If he's alive.

551
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,960
Don't say that.

552
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,500
Of course he's alive.

553
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,200
He's dad.

554
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,160
Here. Take this.

555
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,630
No. No, that's for dad.

556
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,500
Dad lied to me.

557
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,330

What do you think it is? It's
