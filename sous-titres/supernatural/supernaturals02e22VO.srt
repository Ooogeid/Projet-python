1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- Oh, yeah!

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- Hi, guys.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- Welcome to chili's.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- Hey, how are you?

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- savor the sizzle with chili's new fajita trio.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, yeah!

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Marinated steak, tender chicken and flame-kissed 
shrimp all on one plate, - only at chili'S.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
- Oh, yeah!

9
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,600
THE ROAD SO FAR

10
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,300
*carry on, my wayward son

11
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,000
*there'll be peace when you are done

12
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,100
*lay your weary head to rest

13
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,800
*don't you cry no more

14
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,300
Back in 1835,samuel colt made a special gun.

15
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,800
They say this gun can kill anything.

16
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,600
The colt is gone, and it seems pretty damn likely

17
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,800
that the demon is behind all of this.

18
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,400
Whoops.

19
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,000
Crossroads are where pacts are made. In selling your soul,

20
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,500
rituals like this, you got to put your own photo into the mix, right?

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,900
I know all about you,dean winchester.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,100
I'm looking for the best and brightest.

23
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,800
-I'm sam. -I'm jake.

24
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,200
This is a competition.

25
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,100
Only one of you crazy kids is gonna make it out of here alive.

26
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,900
Unh!

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,900
You're tough, you're smart, you're well-trained.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,600
Sam, you're my favorite.

29
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,300
- Sam! - Dean!

30
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,900
- Sam, look out! - Unh!

31
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,500
No!

32
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,800
*Carry on, my wayward son

33
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,100
*let me look at you.Oh, god.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,800
*Oh, god.Ugh!Ugh!

35
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,900
*Don't you cry no more

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,500
sam!!

37
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,600
Now

38
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,200
Dean?

39
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,900
Brought you this back.

40
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,700
No, thanks.I'm fine.

41
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,300
You should eat something.

42
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,100
I said I'm fine.

43
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,200
Dean...

44
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,700
I hate to bring this up.I really do.

45
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,300
But don't you think maybe it's time...we bury sam?

46
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,200
No.

47
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,800
-We could...Maybe... -what -- torch his corpse?

48
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,000
Not yet.

49
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,000
I want you to come with me.

50
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,100
I'm not going anywhere.

51
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,000
-Dean, please. -Won't you cut me some slack?

52
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,200
I just don't think you should be alone,that's all.

53
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,000
I got to admit --I could use your help.

54
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,000
Something big is going down --

55
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,700
-end-of-the-world big. -Well, then let it end!

56
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,300
You don't mean that.

57
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,000
You don't think so?Huh?

58
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,000
You don't think I've given enough?

59
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,500
You don't think I've paid enough?

60
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,100
I'm done with it.

61
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,700
All of it.

62
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,900
And if you know what's good for you, turn around and get the hell out of here.

63
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,200
Go!!

64
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,200
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,900
I'm sorry.Please just go.

66
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,300
You know where I'll be.

67
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,600
Howdy, jake.

68
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,600
I'm -- I'm dreaming,aren't I?

69
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,300
I got a genius on my hands.

70
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,100
Well,congratulations, jake. You're it --last man standing.

71
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,200
The american idol.

72
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,500
I have to admit -- you weren't the horse I was betting on,

73
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,300
but still,I got to give it to you.

74
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,300
Go...to hell.

75
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,800
Been there, done that.

76
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,900
Everything you put me through --

77
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,300
dragging me to that place, making me kill those people...

78
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
all part of the beauty pageant.

79
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,900
-Jake, I needed the strongest,and that's you. -Needed me for what?

80
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,000
Oh, I got a laundry list of tasty things for you.

81
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,300
The only thing I'm gonna do

82
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,800
is wake up, hunt you down, and kill you myself.

83
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,100
You know,others have tried.

84
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,100
It's not easy.

85
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,100
Trust me,jake. You want to be a good little soldier here.

86
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,400
-And if I'm not? -If you're a bad little soldier,

87
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:49,500
well, that dear old mom of yours, that adorable little sister...

88
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,000
I'll make certain that they both live long enough

89
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,800
to know the chewy taste of their own intestines.

90
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,700
No, jake.I'm not bluffing.

91
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,600
-What do you want me to do? -Like I said -- genius.

92
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,300
You know, when we were little --

93
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,700
you couldn't have been more than 5 --

94
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,700
you just started asking questions.

95
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,200
How come we didn't have a mom?

96
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,800
Why do we always have to move around?

97
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,600
Where'd dad go when he'd take off for days at a time?

98
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,600
I remember I begged you -- "quit asking, sammy.Man, you don't want to know."

99
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,500
I just wanted you to be a kid...

100
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,800
just for a little while longer.

101
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,900
I always tried to protect you...

102
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,500
...keep you safe.

103
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,900
Dad didn't even have to tell me.

104
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,400
It was just always my responsibility,you know?

105
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,700
It's like I had one job...

106
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,800
I had one job...

107
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,200
And I screwed it up.

108
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,100
I blew it.

109
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
And for that, I'm sorry.

110
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,400
I guess that's what I do.

111
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,000
I let down the people I love.

112
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,700
I let dad down.

113
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,600
And now I guess I'm just supposed to let you down, too.

114
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,400
How can I?

115
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,600
How am I supposed to live with that?

116
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,400
What am I supposed to do?

117
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,500
Sammy.

118
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,500
God.

119
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,900
What am I supposed to do?

120
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,700
What am I supposed to do?!

121
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,600
Come on, already. Show your face, you bitch!

122
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,600
Easy, sugar.You'll wake the neighbors.

123
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,700
Dean.

124
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,700
It is so, so good to see you.

125
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,100
I mean it.Look at you.

126
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,300
Gone and got your family killed, all alone in the world.

127
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,800
It's too sweet.

128
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,500
Excuse me. You're gonna have to give me a moment.

129
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,300
Sometimes you got to stop and smell the roses.

130
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,100
-I should send you straight back to hell. -Oh, you should.

131
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,200
But you won'T.

132
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,600
-And I know why. -Oh, yeah?

133
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,900
Yeah.

134
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,800
Following in daddy's footsteps, you want to make a deal.

135
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,100
Little sammy back from the dead,and --

136
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
let me guess --you're offering up your own soul?

137
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,200
There are a hundred other demons who'd love to getheir hands on it.

138
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,900
And it's all yours.

139
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,200
All you got to do is bring sam back. Give me 10 years --

140
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,900
-10 years,and then you come for me. -You must be joking.

141
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,800
-That's the same deal you give everybody else. -You're not everybody else.

142
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,600
Why would I want to give you anything?

143
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,800
Just keep your gutter soul. It's too tarnished, anyways.

144
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,400
-Nine years. -No.

145
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,600
Eight.

146
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,100
You keep going,I'll keep saying no.

147
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,700
Okay, five years.

148
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,000
Five years,and my bill comes due. That's my last offer --five years or no deal.

149
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,000
Then no deal.

150
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,200
-Fine. -Fine.

151
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,200
Make sure you bury sam before he starts stinking up the joint.

152
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,100
Wait.

153
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,000
It's a fire sale,and everything must go.

154
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,600
What do I have to do?

155
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,800
First of all,quit groveling. Needy guys are such a turnoff.

156
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,400
Look...

157
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,700
I shouldn't be doing this. I could get in a lot of trouble.

158
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,600
But what can I say? I got a blind spot for you,dean.

159
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,200
You're like A...puppy. You're just too fun to play with.

160
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
I'll do it.

161
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,400
-You'll bring him back? -I will.

162
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,000
And because I'm such a saint, I'll give you one year and one year only.

163
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,600
But here's the thing.

164
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,800
If you try and welch or weasel your way out, then the deal is off.

165
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,000
Sam drops dead. He's back to rotten meat in no time.

166
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,500
So...

167
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,900
better deal than your dad ever got.

168
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,500
What do you say?

169
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,700
-Sammy.Thank god. -Hey.

170
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,200
Ow.Uh, dean...

171
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,800
I'm sorry.I'm sorry, man.I'm just...

172
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,600
I'm just happy to see you up and around, that's all.

173
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,200
-Come on. Sit down. -Okay.

174
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,600
Dean...what happened to me?

175
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,000
Well,what do you remember?

176
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,200
I-I saw you and bobby,and...

177
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,800
I felt this pain,this sharp pain like... like,white-hot,you know, and...

178
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,000
then you started running at me, and... that's about it.

179
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,100
Yeah, that -- that kid stabbed you in the back.

180
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,800
You lost a lot of blood. It was touch and go for a while.

181
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,700
But, dean, you -- you can't patch up a wound that bad.

182
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,100
No, bobby could.

183
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,400
-Who was that kid,anyway? -His name's jake.Did you get him?

184
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,500
-No, he disappeared into the woods. -We got to find him, dean.

185
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,500
And I swear I'm gonna tear that son of a bitch apart.

186
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,300
Whoa, whoa, whoa.Easy, van damme.

187
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
You just woke up,all right? Let's get you something to eat.

188
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,300
You want something to eat?

189
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,500
I'm starving.Come on.

190
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,600
And that's when you guys showed up.

191
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,100
That's awful.Poor andy.

192
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,100
The demon said he only wanted one of us to walk out alive.

193
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,300
-He told you that? -Yep.

194
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,300
-He appeared in a dream. -He tell you anything else?

195
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,200
No. No.That was it.Nothing else.

196
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,700
You know,what I don't get,dean, is if the demon only wanted one of us,

197
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,400
then how did jake and i both get away?

198
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,600
Well, I mean,they left you for dead. I'm sure they thought it was over.

199
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,800
Now that yellow eyes has jake, what's he gonna do with him?

200
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,900
I don't know.

201
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,000
But whatever it is,we got to stop him.

202
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,000
Hold on, all right? You need to get your rest.We got time.

203
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,300
-No, we don'T. -Sam,oceans aren't boiling, okay?

204
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,000
Frogs aren't raining from the sky. Let's get you your strength back first.

205
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,800
Did you call the roadhouse? Do they know anything?

206
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,900
Yeah.

207
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,800
Dean...what is it?

208
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,900
The roadhouse burned to the ground. Ash is dead,probably ellen --a lot of other hunters,too.

209
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,600
-Demons? -Yeah, we think so.

210
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
-We think because ash found something. -What'd he find?

211
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,800
Bobby's working on that right now.

212
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,700
Well, come on, then. Bobby's only a few hours away.

213
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop.Sam, stop, damn it.

214
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,600
You almost died in there. I mean,what would I have --

215
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,300
you just take care of yourself for a little bit,huh? Just for a little bit.

216
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,700
I'm sorry. No.

217
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,000
-Hey, bobby. -Hey, bobby.

218
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,600
Sam.It's good to...see you up and around.

219
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,700
Yeah, well...thanks for patching me up.

220
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,000
Don't mention it.

221
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,600
Well, sam's better.

222
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,600
And we're back in it now,so... what do you know?

223
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,600
Well, I found something, but I'm not sure what the hell it means.

224
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,300
What is it?

225
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,200
Demonic omens...like a frickin' tidal wave. Cattle deaths,lightning storms.

226
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,700
They skyrocketed from out of nowhere.Here.

227
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,300
All around here except for one place --

228
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,800
-southern wyoming. -Wyoming?

229
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,600
Yeah.That one area's totally clean -- spotless.

230
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,900
-It's almost as if... -what?

231
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,600
...The demons are surrounding it.

232
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,800
-But you don't know why? -No,and by this point,my eyes are swimming.

233
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,600
Sam, would you take a look at it? Maybe you can catch something I couldn'T.

234
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,400
Yeah, sure.

235
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,200
Come on, dean.

236
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,200
I got some more books in the truck. Help me lug them in.

237
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,600
Yeah.

238
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,000
You stupid ass!What did you do?

239
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,600
What did you do?!

240
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,500
You made a deal...for sam, didn't you?

241
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,700
-How long did they give you? -Bobby.

242
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,500
How long?!

243
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,400
One year.

244
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
Damn it, dean.

245
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,500
Which is why we got to find this yellow-eyed son of a bitch.

246
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,900
That's why I'm gonna kill him myself. I got nothing to lose now,right?

247
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:02,800
-I could throttle you! -And send me downstairs ahead of schedule?

248
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,800
What is it with you winchesters, huh?

249
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,400
You, your dad,you're both just itching to throw yourselves down the pit.

250
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,200
That's my point.

251
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,500
Dad brought me back, bobby. I'm not even supposed to be here.

252
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,900
At least this way, something good could come out of it,you know?

253
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,900
-It's like my life can mean something. -What?

254
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,000
And it didn't before?

255
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,600
Have you got that low an opinion of yourself? Are you that screwed in the head?!

256
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,600
I couldn't let him die,bobby.

257
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,500
I couldn'T.

258
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,900
He's my brother.

259
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,800
How is your brother gonna feel when he knows you're going to hell?

260
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,700
How'd you feel when you knew your dad went for you?

261
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,300
You can't tell him.

262
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,200
You take a shot at me,whatever you got to do, but please don't tell him.

263
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,400
Ellen?

264
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,600
-Ellen. -Oh, god.

265
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,510
Bobby, is this really necessary?

266
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,370
Just a belt of holy water.

267
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,570
Shouldn't hurt.

268
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,880
Whiskey now, if you don't mind.

269
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:53,970
Ellen, what happened?

270
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:54,960
How'd you get out?

271
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,230
I wasn't supposed to.

272
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,410
I was supposed to be in there with everybody else.

273
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,800
But we ran out of pretzels, of all things.

274
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,080
It was just dumb luck.

275
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,720
Anyway, that's when ash called, panic in his voice.

276
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,450
He told me to look in the safe.

277
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,930
Then the call cut out.

278
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:23,550
By the time I got back, the flames were sky-high, and everybody was dead.

279
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,740
I couldn't have been gone more than 15 minutes.

280
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,440
Sorry, ellen.

281
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,900
A lot of good people died in there.

282
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,130
And i got to live.

283
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,650
Lucky me.

284
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,730
Ellen, you mentioned a safe.

285
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,440
A hidden safe we keep in the basement.

286
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,950
Demons get what was in it?

287
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,500
No.

288
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,960
Wyoming.

289
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,460
What does that mean?

290
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,030
I don't believe it.

291
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:03,830
What?

292
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,050
You got something?

293
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,510
A lot more than that.

294
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:16,550
Each of these x's is an abandoned frontier church -- all mid-19th century and all of them built by samuel colt.

295
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:19,420
Samuel colt -- the demon-killing, gunmaking samuel colt?

296
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,610
Yep.

297
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:21,790
And there's more.

298
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,920
He built private railway lines connecting church to church.

299
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,620
It just happens to lay out like this.

300
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,360
Tell me that's not what I think it is.

301
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,340
It's a devil's trap.

302
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,120
A 100-square-mile devil's trap.

303
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,580
That's brilliant.

304
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,570
Iron lines demons can't cross.

305
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,190
I never heard of anything that massive.

306
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,220
No one has.

307
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,040
None of the lines are broken?

308
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,600
It still works?

309
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,230
Definitely.

310
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,050
How do you know?

311
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,650
All those omens bobby found.

312
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,070
The demons, they must be circling and they can't get in.

313
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,620
Yeah, well...

314
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,620
they're trying.

315
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,950
Why?What's inside?

316
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:05,780
That's what I've been looking for, and, uh, there's nothing except an old cowboy cemetery right in the middle.

317
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,060
Well, what's so important about a cemetery or...

318
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,160
what's colt trying to protect?

319
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,110
Well, unless...

320
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,580
unless what?

321
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,190
What if colt wasn't trying to keep the demons out?

322
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,960
What if he was trying to keep something in?

323
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,480
That's a comforting thought.

324
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,600
Yeah, you think?

325
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,480
Could they do it, bobby?

326
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,400
Could they get inside?

327
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,200
This thing's so powerful, you'd practically need an a-bomb to destroy it.

328
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,540
No way a full-blood demon gets across.

329
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,820
No.

330
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,540
But I know who could.

331
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,530
Howdy, jake.

332
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,720
So, did you have a nice trip?

333
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,930
I'm here.

334
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,230
I did what you asked.

335
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,300
Now what?

336
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,100
50 miles thataway, there's a cemetery, a crypt.

337
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,830
You got to open that for me.

338
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,560
Think you can manage that, sport?

339
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,080
You know what?

340
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,800
Screw you and your freaky orders.

341
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,870
Go do it yourself.

342
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,800
Oh, I can'T.

343
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,810
I can't go that way -- not yet.

344
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,100
Why not?

345
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,770
I just can'T.

346
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,800
But if you're gonna open that crypt for me, you're gonna need a key.

347
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,110
A gun?

348
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,740
Oh, this isn't just any gun, jake.

349
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,840
This is the only gun in the whole universe that can shoot me dead.

350
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,740
Is that so?

351
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,700
Yep.

352
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,280
Here, take it.

353
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
Oh, my.

354
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,980
I'm shocked at this unforeseen turn of events.

355
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,660
Go ahead, jake.

356
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,420
Squeeze that trigger.

357
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,900
Be all you can be.

358
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,860
This will all be over.

359
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,200
Your life can go back to normal.

360
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,950
Of course, the army won't take you back 'cause you're awol.

361
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,660
But I'm sure you could get your old job at the factory back.

362
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:20,640
But then, on the other hand, the rest of your life and your family's could be money and honey,

363
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,010
health and wealth, every day is ice-cream sundae.

364
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:26,120
And all you got to do is this one little thing.

365
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,240
Why me?

366
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,640
Oh, jake.

367
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,200
It's got to be you.

368
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:34,250
I've been waiting for you for a very long time.

369
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,260
You're my leader.

370
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,030
You open that crypt, and you will have your army.

371
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,690
You're talking about the end of the world.

372
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,510
No, not the end -- the beginning...

373
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,680
a better world where your family will be protected.

374
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,230
More than that.

375
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,770
They'll be royalty.

376
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,200
Buddy boy, you have the chance to get in on the ground floor of a thrilling opportunity.

377
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,430
What do you say?

378
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,810
It's your call.

379
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,070
Attababy.

380
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,230
Howdy, jake.

381
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,120
Wait...

382
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,130
you were dead.

383
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,120
I killed you.

384
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,180
Yeah?

385
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,960
Well, next time, finish the job.

386
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,200
I did.

387
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,440
I cut clean through your spinal cord, man.

388
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,420
You can't be alive.

389
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,520
You can't be.

390
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,810
Okay, just take it real easy there, son.

391
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,040
And if I don't?

392
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,910
Wait and see.

393
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,800
What, you a tough guy all of a sudden?

394
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,830
What are you gonna do -- kill me?

395
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,010
It's a thought.

396
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,070
You had your chance.

397
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,240
You couldn'T.

398
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,120
I won't make that mistake twice.

399
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,890
What are you smiling at, you little bitch?

400
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,050
Hey, lady.

401
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,290
Do me a favor.

402
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,670
Put that gun to your head.

403
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,840
See, that ava girl was right.

404
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,780
Once you give in to it, there's all sorts of new jedi mind tricks you can learn.

405
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,860
Let her go.

406
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,410
Shoot him.

407
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:05,400
You'll be mopping up skull before you get a shot off.

408
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,240
Everybody, put your guns down.

409
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,090
Except you, sweetheart.

410
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,770
Okay.

411
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,140
Thank you.

412
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,330
Please...

413
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,540
don'T.

414
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,090
Please.

415
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,910
Oh, no.

416
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,500
Bobby, what is it?

417
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,720
It's hell.

418
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,470
Take cover -- now!

419
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,160
What the hell just happened?!

420
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,190
That's a devil's gate, a damn door to hell!

421
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,520
Come on!

422
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,810
We got to shut that gate!

423
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,510
If the demon gave this to jake...

424
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,140
then maybe...

425
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,320
A boy shouldn't play with daddy's guns.

426
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:05,940
Dean!

427
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,230
I'll get to you in a minute, champ.

428
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:17,170
I'm proud of you -- knew you had it in you.

429
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:24,840
Sit a spell.

430
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,330
So, dean...

431
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,250
I got to thank you.

432
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:37,700
You see, demons can't resurrect people unless a deal is made.

433
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,380
I know, red tape -- it'll make you nuts.

434
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,960
But thanks to you, sammy's back in rotation.

435
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:47,400
Now, I wasn't counting on that, but I'm glad.

436
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,690
I liked him better than jake, anyhow.

437
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:56,830
Tell me -- have you ever heard the expression "if a deal sounds too good to be true, it probably is"?

438
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,490
You call that deal good?

439
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:01,320
It's a better shake than your dad ever got.

440
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,390
And you never wondered why?

441
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,350
I'm surprised at you.

442
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:07,970
I mean...

443
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,690
you saw what your brother just did to jake, right?

444
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:14,030
That was pretty cold, wasn't it?

445
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:24,060
How certain are you that what you brought back is 100% pure sam?

446
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,950
You of all people should know that what's dead should stay dead.

447
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,790
Anyway...

448
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,520
thanks a bunch.

449
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,330
I knew I kept you alive for some reason.

450
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,190
Until now, anyway.

451
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:57,490
I couldn't have done it without your pathetic, self-loathing, self-destructive desire to sacrifice yourself for your family.

452
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,280
well, check that off the to-do list.

453
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,770
You did it.

454
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,580
I didn't do it alone.

455
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,830
Do you think dad really...

456
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,750
do you think he really climbed out of hell?

457
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,520
The door was open.

458
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,710
If anyone's stubborn enough to do it...

459
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,480
it would be him.

460
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,900
Where do you think he is now?

461
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,650
I don't know.

462
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,210
I kind of can't believe it, dean.

463
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,350
I mean...

464
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,430
our whole lives, everything...

465
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:28,390
has been prepping for this, and now I...

466
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,290
I kind of don't know what to say.

467
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,300
I do.

468
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,050
That was for our mom...

469
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,700
you son of a bitch.

470
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,750
You know, when jake saw me...

471
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,990
it was like he saw a ghost.

472
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,600
I mean, hell, you heard him, dean.

473
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,300
He said he killed me.

474
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,050
I'm glad he was wrong.

475
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,670
I don't think he was, dean.

476
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,150
What happened...

477
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,000
after I was stabbed?

478
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,950
I already told you.

479
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,430
Not everything.

480
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,040
Sam, we just killed the demon.

481
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,950
Can we celebrate for a minute?

482
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,320
Did I die?

483
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,710
Oh, come on.

484
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:51,010
Did you sell your soul for me, like dad did for you?

485
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:51,450
Come on!

486
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,420
No!

487
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,830
Tell me the truth.

488
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,730
Dean, tell me the truth.

489
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,050
Sam...

490
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:15,810
How long do you get?

491
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,060
One year.

492
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,860
I got one year.

493
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,460
You shouldn't have done that.

494
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,140
How could you do that?

495
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,580
Don't get mad at me.

496
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,090
Don't you do that.

497
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,750
I had to.

498
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,830
I had to look out for you.

499
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,200
That's my job.

500
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,920
And what do you think my job is?

501
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,360
What?

502
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,670
You saved my life over and over.

503
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,700
I mean, you sacrifice everything for me.

504
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,340
Don't you think I'd do the same for you?

505
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,800
You're my big brother.

506
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:04,820
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you.

507
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,710
And I don't care what it takes.I'm gonna get you out of this.

508
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,140
Guess I got to save your ass for a change.

509
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,710
Yeah.

510
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,320
Well...

511
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,820
yellow-eyed demon might be dead, but a lot more got through that gate.

512
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,480
How many, you think?

513
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,350
100, maybe 200.

514
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,880
It's an army.

515
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,360
He's unleashed an army.

516
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,140
Hope to hell you boys are ready.

517
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,760
'Cause the war has just begun.

518
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,080
Well, then...

519
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:53,150
[ Boston's "don't look back" plays ]

520
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,080
we got work to do.
