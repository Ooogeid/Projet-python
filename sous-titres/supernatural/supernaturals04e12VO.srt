1
00:00:02,347 --> 00:00:04,337
Tell me about those months
without your brother.

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:07,131
About all the things you and
this demon bitch do in the dark.

3
00:00:09,665 --> 00:00:12,449
Do you even know how far off
the reservetion you've gone?

4
00:00:12,574 --> 00:00:14,722
How far from normal?
From human?

5
00:00:15,752 --> 00:00:18,100
- Why do you trust her so much?
- She saved my life.

6
00:00:21,617 --> 00:00:24,482
You don't have the juice
to take me on, sam.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,269
No, your abilities...
You're getting flabby.

8
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:30,363
- Yeah, so how do I tone up?
- You know what you got to do.

9
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,185
No, I'm not doing that anymore.

10
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,263
I said no.

11
00:00:54,256 --> 00:00:55,429
Charlier cut.

12
00:00:55,938 --> 00:00:57,223
You're really good.

13
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,599
Yeah, great.

14
00:00:59,758 --> 00:01:02,144
- Hey, show us another.
- Finish your drink, vance.

15
00:01:03,074 --> 00:01:05,314
This is a simple riffle shuffle.

16
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,362
Do a card trick for me.

17
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,868
Ooh, here we go...
The incredible jay.

18
00:01:14,452 --> 00:01:17,445
All right, young lady,
would you please tell me when to stop?

19
00:01:17,752 --> 00:01:18,536
Stop.

20
00:01:20,345 --> 00:01:21,497
This is your card.

21
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:23,112
Commit it to memory.

22
00:01:24,403 --> 00:01:26,891
- That's incredible, jay.
- Don't be a jerk.

23
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:28,631
Right, now...

24
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:30,506
Do you see your card?

25
00:01:31,031 --> 00:01:32,853
Um, no, I don't.

26
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:35,845
No, The cards say "no."

27
00:01:36,504 --> 00:01:38,566
- Check his pocket.
- For god's sake, vance.

28
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:40,120
Oh, just check...

29
00:01:40,245 --> 00:01:42,067
Check the damn pocket!

30
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,035
So, if you then would remove...

31
00:01:48,997 --> 00:01:50,545
Is this your card?

32
00:01:52,184 --> 00:01:53,402
Why are you so mean?

33
00:01:53,527 --> 00:01:55,531
Can't you just leave
the old guy alone?

34
00:02:08,447 --> 00:02:10,415
Is he wearing eyeliner?

35
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:12,360
Can't tell.

36
00:02:12,485 --> 00:02:14,508
I'm blinded by all
the sterling silver.

37
00:02:14,996 --> 00:02:17,008
The light has to find me!

38
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,181
Get it?!
It... it has to find me!

39
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,202
What a douche bag.

40
00:02:22,327 --> 00:02:24,819
Would guys give it a rest?
You're giving me a headache.

41
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:25,978
Oh, come on, jay.

42
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,766
His misdirect is shaking his
ass like an 8th avenue hooker.

43
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:31,027
- Used to be about skill.
- Yeah, used to be.

44
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:32,657
Used to be.
Listen to the you two.

45
00:02:32,782 --> 00:02:33,756
It's pathetic.

46
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,281
Bitter, old men talking
about the glory days.

47
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,410
You know what?

48
00:02:38,535 --> 00:02:40,576
This douche bag isn't the joke.

49
00:02:41,858 --> 00:02:42,870
We are.

50
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,622
Hey, who you calling a joke?

51
00:02:46,404 --> 00:02:47,958
Me, for one.

52
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:54,757
That used to be us.

53
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:58,511
You know, maybe he is a douche bag,
but he's playing the main stage,

54
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,721
and we can't even
afford an assistant.

55
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,431
What the hell are we doing?

56
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,840
- We're doing all right.
- No, we're not.

57
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,519
We're sad,

58
00:03:07,084 --> 00:03:08,170
we're old...

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,373
And we're dying.

60
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,818
I'm gonna do the table
of death tonight.

61
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:16,487
No. No, you're not, jay.
Don't be crazy.

62
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,733
You almost killed yourself
the last time you tried it.

63
00:03:18,858 --> 00:03:21,694
- And that was 30 years ago!
- Who cares if it kills me?

64
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:24,256
At least I'll go
out with a headline.

65
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,304
Ladies and gentlemen,

66
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:31,132
what you are about
to see is not a trick

67
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:32,689
or an illusion...

68
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:35,487
Simply a display of daring

69
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:36,799
and dexterity.

70
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:47,852
Now, young lady,
if you'll please check the bindings.

71
00:03:49,558 --> 00:03:51,063
You'll see they're very real,

72
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,232
very tight.

73
00:03:54,497 --> 00:03:55,417
Thank you.

74
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:57,110
You may take your seat.

75
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,324
Damn straight they're tight.

76
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,721
You sure you can slip them?

77
00:04:44,166 --> 00:04:47,179
Show's in an hour, Vance.
Try to be on time.

78
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,428
Synchro VO : IceFre@k

79
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:56,617
This isn't a trick, okay?

80
00:05:56,742 --> 00:05:58,484
I- I don't do tricks.

81
00:05:58,754 --> 00:06:01,329
This is a demonstration

82
00:06:01,854 --> 00:06:04,454
about demons and angels,

83
00:06:04,703 --> 00:06:06,949
- love and lust...
- What a douche bag.

84
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,497
... all that stuff
mixed up in my head.

85
00:06:09,622 --> 00:06:10,744
That's jeb dexter.

86
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:14,583
I don't even want to
know how you know that.

87
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:16,571
He's famous... kind of.

88
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:19,142
For what, douchebaggery?

89
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:22,012
... how messed up it gets,
don't touch me, okay?

90
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:23,529
For your own safety.

91
00:06:38,642 --> 00:06:41,614
Go back to hell, demon!

92
00:06:49,197 --> 00:06:50,519
Is this your card?

93
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,962
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
A fake demon possession?

94
00:07:00,272 --> 00:07:02,558
I can't believe people
actually fall for that crap.

95
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,103
It's not all crap.

96
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:06,379
What part of that was not
a steaming pile of B. S?

97
00:07:06,504 --> 00:07:09,372
Okay, that was crap,
but that's not all magicians.

98
00:07:09,608 --> 00:07:10,725
It takes skill.

99
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,457
Oh, right. Right.
I forgot.

100
00:07:13,582 --> 00:07:15,225
You were into this stuff,
weren't you?

101
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,695
You had, like,
a deck of cards and a wand.

102
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,980
Dude, I was 13.
It was a phase.

103
00:07:20,551 --> 00:07:23,025
Just... it bugs me.
Actually, it offends me.

104
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:25,694
You know,
playing at demons and magic,

105
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,588
when the real thing
will kill you bloody.

106
00:07:28,216 --> 00:07:30,192
Like a guy who drops
dead of 10 stab wounds

107
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:31,949
without a single tear in his shirt?

108
00:07:32,074 --> 00:07:33,570
That's what I'm talking about.

109
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:44,254
So, did your boss have any
enemies that you know of?

110
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,799
- Vance had plenty of enemies.
- How so?

111
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,733
He would steal from
other magicians...

112
00:07:49,858 --> 00:07:51,190
All the time.

113
00:07:51,528 --> 00:07:52,891
What would he steal?

114
00:07:53,311 --> 00:07:55,658
Stage effects, closeup techniques...

115
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,893
Anything he could get his hands on.

116
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,796
Is that enough to get him killed?

117
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:02,452
These guys take this
stuff pretty seriously.

118
00:08:03,272 --> 00:08:04,645
There you are.

119
00:08:08,837 --> 00:08:11,112
Did you find anything
weird in vance's stuff?

120
00:08:11,543 --> 00:08:12,991
Well... weirder?

121
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,692
Matter of fact, I did.

122
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,629
I'm guessing this
didn't belong to vae.

123
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:27,464
He hated card tricks.

124
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:29,608
Never wanted them around,

125
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:31,510
let alone in his precious cape.

126
00:08:50,768 --> 00:08:52,592
You gonna tell me how you did it?

127
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,252
Did what?

128
00:08:55,727 --> 00:08:56,910
You know what.

129
00:08:57,695 --> 00:08:59,955
The great ones never
give away the "how."

130
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,208
Yesterday you were sad,
old, and dying.

131
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:06,274
Today you're one of the great ones?
Come on.

132
00:09:06,705 --> 00:09:08,463
This is me you're talking to.

133
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,244
You didn't think I could do it.

134
00:09:11,562 --> 00:09:13,365
No, jay, I didn't.

135
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,814
You're my friend.

136
00:09:16,132 --> 00:09:18,974
My best friend.
I just didn't want to see you get hurt.

137
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:22,227
- That's all.
- Charlie, you want to see something?

138
00:09:23,066 --> 00:09:24,131
Look at this.

139
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,718
- Not bad.
- "Not bad"?

140
00:09:37,283 --> 00:09:40,488
I've been working to pull an ace
out of the middle of the deck for years.

141
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,080
Just one...
And now I can pull three.

142
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:46,748
Still ssing the ace of hearts.

143
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:52,138
I want to do
the executioner tonight.

144
00:09:53,337 --> 00:09:55,446
Are you trying to
get yourself killed?

145
00:09:55,571 --> 00:09:56,803
It's just a rope slip.

146
00:09:57,293 --> 00:09:59,264
Houdini wouldn't
try the executioner.

147
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:00,500
Exactly.

148
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:03,185
Think about it, Charlie.
If I can pull this off...

149
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:06,566
I think you're pushing your luck.

150
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:08,971
It wasn'tluck.

151
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,400
It wasn't.

152
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:13,831
Here, stand over there.

153
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:16,402
Let's not end up like this,
charlie...

154
00:10:16,527 --> 00:10:18,125
A couple of old farts

155
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,535
doing birthdays and bar mitzvahs.

156
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,951
It beats dying.

157
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:26,001
Does it?

158
00:10:26,852 --> 00:10:28,908
I would do anything for you.
You know that.

159
00:10:29,594 --> 00:10:32,161
But I will not watch you die.

160
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:35,452
- I'll miss that show.
- No, you'll be there.

161
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,053
You're always there for me.

162
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:41,390
Check your pocket.

163
00:10:49,726 --> 00:10:51,294
That's good, jay.

164
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,776
That's pretty damn good.

165
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,850
I can do it, charlie.

166
00:10:55,895 --> 00:10:57,063
I want to do it.

167
00:10:58,293 --> 00:10:59,205
Please.

168
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,835
It's a lame gig.

169
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,814
I'm in a fleabag hotel doing
this man-of-the-people crap,

170
00:11:13,142 --> 00:11:16,214
and freakin' angel's in vegas
doing cirque du soleil!

171
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:18,581
Thatshould have been mine.

172
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,845
All right, boys, get it in gear.
I don't got all day.

173
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,017
You vernon haskell?

174
00:11:25,397 --> 00:11:26,351
Who's asking?

175
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,618
Federal agent ulrich.

176
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,164
Looking into the death
of patrick vance.

177
00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:36,894
I'm jeb dexter.
This is devil twist.

178
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:40,878
We're chilling at the international
magicians convention, which is a...

179
00:11:41,003 --> 00:11:44,661
dope chance to tip my hat to
the wicked cats who came before me.

180
00:11:45,096 --> 00:11:47,456
Smokin'- hot effect last night, jim.

181
00:11:47,904 --> 00:11:48,704
Jay.

182
00:11:50,538 --> 00:11:51,960
My name is jay.

183
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:55,273
Yeah, whatever.
We can loop it later.

184
00:11:57,128 --> 00:11:58,759
What a douche bag.

185
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,452
Couldn't agree more.

186
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,696
Is, uh...

187
00:12:04,496 --> 00:12:05,972
This familiar to you?

188
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,190
Should it be?

189
00:12:09,948 --> 00:12:12,356
Well, I heard that you used
tarot cards in your act.

190
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:13,423
My act?

191
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,485
That was a long time ago.

192
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,926
I haven't touched a deck in years,
you know...

193
00:12:20,145 --> 00:12:22,697
Do know someone
that might use them now?

194
00:12:23,465 --> 00:12:25,911
Well, there was a guy
down on bleecker street.

195
00:12:27,923 --> 00:12:29,915
He... he peddles
that kind of specialty stuff.

196
00:12:30,587 --> 00:12:32,042
Did he have a problem with Vance?

197
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,394
Matter of fact,
Vance crossed him about a year ago.

198
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:39,800
Probably cost him 50
grand in royalties.

199
00:12:41,532 --> 00:12:43,678
- You know the exact address?
- 426 bleecker.

200
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,067
Ask for chief.

201
00:12:45,662 --> 00:12:46,564
Chief.

202
00:12:47,722 --> 00:12:48,880
Thank you.

203
00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:19,763
I'm, uh, here to see chief.

204
00:13:32,808 --> 00:13:33,864
Stay here.

205
00:13:34,868 --> 00:13:36,508
Don't touch anything.

206
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:08,430
You are really gonna get it tonight,
big boy.

207
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,275
There's been a misunderstanding.

208
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:15,903
I, uh, think I've been had.

209
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,276
Oh, you ain't been had...

210
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,650
Till you been had by the chief.

211
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,541
Oh, And before we get started...

212
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,616
... what's your safe word?

213
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:54,726
What are you doing here?

214
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,561
I should be asking
you the same thing.

215
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:02,974
I'm working a job.

216
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:05,547
The whole world's about to be
engulfed in hellfire,

217
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:08,018
and you're in magictown, usa.

218
00:15:09,002 --> 00:15:10,700
You got something against magic?

219
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:14,666
That would almost be funny if 34
seals hadn't been broken already.

220
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:16,081
34, sam.

221
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:18,941
That's over halfway.

222
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,295
The angels are losing this war.

223
00:15:23,471 --> 00:15:26,011
Every day is one day closer,
and if someone

224
00:15:26,136 --> 00:15:28,357
- doesn't do something soon...
- And that someone is me?

225
00:15:28,482 --> 00:15:30,916
- Who else would it be?
- I don't know where these seals are.

226
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,548
I don't know squat.

227
00:15:33,378 --> 00:15:35,392
Why don't you tell me
where you'd like me to start?

228
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,852
Well, you can quit dicking
around here, for one.

229
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,284
Bigger fish, sam.

230
00:15:40,018 --> 00:15:41,670
And if the seals are being broken,

231
00:15:41,795 --> 00:15:43,942
you might want to go after
the one doing the breaking.

232
00:15:44,603 --> 00:15:45,318
Lilith?

233
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,945
Cut the head off the snake.

234
00:15:47,965 --> 00:15:50,527
You're the only one
who can stop her, sam.

235
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,359
So step up...
and kill the little bitch.

236
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:56,572
Oh, I'm game, believe me.

237
00:15:57,034 --> 00:15:59,040
It's not the psychic thing
I got a problem with.

238
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,419
Yeah, I know what you got
a problem with, but tough.

239
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,300
It's the only way.

240
00:16:08,214 --> 00:16:08,993
No.

241
00:16:09,556 --> 00:16:11,963
You know, this would all
be so much easier

242
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:14,485
if you'd just admit
to yourself that you like it.

243
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,810
That feeling that it gives you.

244
00:16:19,691 --> 00:16:21,423
You don't know what
you're talking about.

245
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:22,647
Oh, I don't, huh?

246
00:16:23,923 --> 00:16:24,774
Fine.

247
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:28,403
It's simple...

248
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:31,043
Lucifer rises,
the apocalypse starts.

249
00:16:31,168 --> 00:16:33,325
You think that you have
demons on your hands now?

250
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:35,695
People are gonna die, sam.

251
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,329
Oceans of people.

252
00:16:39,284 --> 00:16:41,498
So, you just let me
know when you're ready.

253
00:16:53,734 --> 00:16:55,732
- Find anything interesting?
- What?

254
00:16:57,064 --> 00:16:58,538
No. You?

255
00:16:59,216 --> 00:17:02,020
Nothing I want to talk about
or think about ever again.

256
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:06,858
He's crazy, and you know it.

257
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:08,818
He says he can do it.

258
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,857
Did you even try to
talk him out of it?

259
00:17:10,982 --> 00:17:12,741
Till I was blue in the face.

260
00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:15,626
But I tell you, vernon, there was...

261
00:17:16,822 --> 00:17:19,509
- There was something in his eyes.
- "In his eyes."

262
00:17:19,776 --> 00:17:21,549
You're both nuts.

263
00:17:26,436 --> 00:17:27,379
The chief, huh?

264
00:17:28,178 --> 00:17:30,131
What's the matter?
The chief not your type?

265
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,010
I could have you both
arrested for obstruction of justice.

266
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,637
How?
You're no fed.

267
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,630
We con people for a living, son.

268
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,350
Takes more than a fake
badge to get past us.

269
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,188
You got us.

270
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,550
Yeah, we... We are actually...

271
00:17:48,513 --> 00:17:50,026
Aspiring magicians.

272
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,571
Yeah, we came to the convention 'cause
we thought we could learn something.

273
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,459
Yeah, get some ideas
for our new show.

274
00:17:55,584 --> 00:17:56,908
Ooh, what kind of show?

275
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,702
- Well, it's...
- It's a brother act.

276
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,581
You know, with the rings
and doves and...

277
00:18:03,514 --> 00:18:04,385
rings.

278
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:09,560
<i>Ladies and Gentlemans,
I give you the incredible Jay.</i>

279
00:18:10,308 --> 00:18:11,715
You want to learn something?

280
00:18:14,203 --> 00:18:15,115
Stick around.

281
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,512
Ladies and gentlemen,
what you're about to witness

282
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,849
is a feat so daring,
so dangerous, even

283
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,301
the great houdini
dared not attempt it.

284
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,462
I give to you...

285
00:18:25,587 --> 00:18:26,813
The executioner!

286
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:39,534
Now, sir, as you can see,
this jacket is the real article.

287
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:44,986
Thank you, sir.
You may take your seat.

288
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:49,680
Now, I will have one minute...

289
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:51,320
60 seconds...

290
00:18:52,242 --> 00:18:54,158
To escape certain death.

291
00:18:56,453 --> 00:18:58,000
Let's see if I can do it.

292
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,493
Oh! That was amazing!
That was freakin' amazing!

293
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,863
That was...

294
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:07,717
Not humanly possible.

295
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:19,275
Looks like this guy jay was
a pretty big deal in the'70s.

296
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,103
Which in magician land means what,
exactly?

297
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:24,222
Big enough to play
radio city music hall.

298
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,808
What got him stuck in
their "where are they now?" File?

299
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:30,108
He got old.

300
00:20:33,093 --> 00:20:35,355
Okay, so maybe incredible jay

301
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,735
is using real magic to stage
a comeback.

302
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:39,063
It's possible.

303
00:20:39,188 --> 00:20:41,705
Some kind of spell that works
a death transference.

304
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,716
How does the tarot card mix into it?

305
00:20:43,841 --> 00:20:45,237
I don't know.

306
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:47,607
Man...

307
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,295
Hope I die before I get old.

308
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,169
Whole thing seems brutal, don't it?

309
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:02,677
You think we will?

310
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:04,822
What?

311
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,038
Die before we get old.

312
00:21:07,986 --> 00:21:10,197
- Haven't we both already?
- You know what I mean, dean.

313
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,105
I mean, do you think we'll still
be chasing demons when we're 60?

314
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,024
No, I think we'll be dead...

315
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:17,383
For good.

316
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,653
What? You want to end up like...
Like travis?

317
00:21:21,383 --> 00:21:23,865
- Or gordon, maybe?
- There's bobby.

318
00:21:24,674 --> 00:21:27,810
Oh, ah, there's a poster child
for growing old gracefully.

319
00:21:31,397 --> 00:21:32,707
Maybe we'll be different.

320
00:21:34,348 --> 00:21:36,411
What kind of kool-aid
you drinking, man?

321
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,564
Sammy, it ends bloody or sad.

322
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:41,966
That's just the life.

323
00:21:48,634 --> 00:21:50,078
What if we could win?

324
00:21:50,632 --> 00:21:51,476
"Win"?

325
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:54,157
If there was a way we could just...

326
00:21:55,254 --> 00:21:56,740
Put an end to all of it.

327
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,526
Is there something going
on you're not telling me?

328
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,277
No. Look, I'm just saying...

329
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:06,664
I just wish there
was a way we could...

330
00:22:07,506 --> 00:22:09,658
Go after the source.
That's all.

331
00:22:11,016 --> 00:22:12,330
Cut the head off the snake.

332
00:22:14,572 --> 00:22:17,418
Well, the problem with the snake
is that it has a thousand heads.

333
00:22:17,851 --> 00:22:20,421
Evil bitches just keep
piling out of the volkswagen.

334
00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:26,761
Guess you're right.

335
00:22:30,886 --> 00:22:32,892
Why don't you go see if
you can track down jay?

336
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:36,953
I'll see what I can dig
up on this tarot card.

337
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:49,158
Maid found jeb hanging
from the ceiling fan.

338
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,994
Police think it was a suicide.

339
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:52,415
I beg to differ.

340
00:22:53,563 --> 00:22:55,561
Pulled a little
sleight of hand myself.

341
00:22:56,361 --> 00:22:58,418
- On dexter's body?
- So I'm thinking if this spell

342
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,379
is a death transference,
then these cards work like

343
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,087
black-magic targets.

344
00:23:03,212 --> 00:23:04,833
Any connection between the victims?

345
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:06,759
Jeb was a total douche
bag to jay yesterday.

346
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,575
What about the first vic?
Vance?

347
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,589
Asked around.

348
00:23:09,714 --> 00:23:12,223
Apparently, vance was heckling jay
at the bar the day he was killed.

349
00:23:14,418 --> 00:23:18,046
Okay, so jay sneaks a card into vance's
pocket, does the table of death...

350
00:23:18,171 --> 00:23:20,546
And vance takes 10
swords to the chest.

351
00:23:20,854 --> 00:23:23,150
Then jay slips a noose
and jeb doesn't.

352
00:23:24,031 --> 00:23:25,025
Hell of a trick.

353
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,095
I think it's time we had
a little chat with jay.

354
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,663
Any luck tailing him?

355
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:30,928
He slipped me.

356
00:23:32,413 --> 00:23:33,725
He's a 60-year-old.

357
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:35,692
He's a magician.

358
00:23:59,097 --> 00:24:00,909
- Up against the wall!
- God, who are you?

359
00:24:01,034 --> 00:24:03,008
- Now!
- We know what you've been up to.

360
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:05,568
You been working some real bad
mojo to jump-start your act.

361
00:24:05,994 --> 00:24:08,029
What?
I dunno what you're talking about.

362
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,048
We know you put
a spell on those tarot cards.

363
00:24:10,173 --> 00:24:11,365
Messing with real magic?

364
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,548
"Real magic"?

365
00:24:12,673 --> 00:24:14,544
Come on,
there's no such thing as real magic.

366
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:16,168
- Is that so?
- Yeah, believe me.

367
00:24:16,293 --> 00:24:19,524
I've been around this my whole life.
It's all just... It's... it's illusions.

368
00:24:19,649 --> 00:24:20,643
It's tricks.

369
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,311
It's all fake.

370
00:24:22,436 --> 00:24:24,822
Jeb dexter strung up...
Was that just an illusion?

371
00:24:25,739 --> 00:24:27,215
What?
Something happened to jeb?

372
00:24:27,543 --> 00:24:29,008
He was found hanged in his room.

373
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,094
Right after you slipped
the noose last night.

374
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,324
I don't know what
you're talking about.

375
00:24:36,449 --> 00:24:37,832
Please...

376
00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:39,727
Just let me go.

377
00:24:41,552 --> 00:24:42,730
Something's not right.

378
00:24:44,534 --> 00:24:46,818
Usually they're whipping some
badass hoodoo at us by now.

379
00:24:48,694 --> 00:24:49,996
What do you want to do?

380
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:55,510
All right, so,
if it's not him, who is it?

381
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:58,234
Even if jay's not working the magic,
he's still getting the reward.

382
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,948
His shows are selling out.

383
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,018
All right.

384
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:05,617
So, then, whoever it is,
they're obviously in jay's corner.

385
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:08,228
All right, so we got vernon
and charlie on the list.

386
00:25:08,353 --> 00:25:09,294
Anyone else?

387
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:13,209
We could always ask him.

388
00:25:17,452 --> 00:25:19,204
Guess we should have
seen that one coming.

389
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:21,551
Come on.
He couldn't have gotten that far.

390
00:25:36,307 --> 00:25:38,320
- No way he could outrun us.
- Maybe he vanished.

391
00:25:38,445 --> 00:25:40,663
- He really is good.
- Or he found a back door.

392
00:25:45,947 --> 00:25:49,109
That's them! Those are the two
nut jobs that just broke in my room!

393
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:51,257
Freeze.
Hands where I can see them.

394
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,037
They said my act is killing people.

395
00:26:00,162 --> 00:26:02,393
They said that I was
using real magic,

396
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,607
that I was casting spells
on tarot cards.

397
00:26:04,732 --> 00:26:06,731
"Real magic." Those guys are nuts.

398
00:26:07,704 --> 00:26:09,333
You're lucky to be alive.

399
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,060
You don't think...

400
00:26:13,933 --> 00:26:14,697
What?

401
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,246
Well, the things
that I can do now... the cards.

402
00:26:17,371 --> 00:26:19,495
You've been working
the cards your whole life.

403
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,952
What about the escapes?

404
00:26:21,077 --> 00:26:23,682
I haven't been able to slip
a pair of cuffs in 30 years.

405
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,919
And then there was the way that
patrick vance died and that jeb dexter.

406
00:26:28,261 --> 00:26:29,545
Yeah, no great loss there.

407
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,465
- He didn't deserve to die.
- You had nothing to do with it.

408
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:35,745
He was hanged the same night
that I performed the executioner.

409
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:36,996
Wait a minute.

410
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:40,028
Are you telling me that you
actually believe those guys?

411
00:26:40,153 --> 00:26:42,559
That there was some kind
of "real magic" involved?

412
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,668
No.

413
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:46,886
I don't know.

414
00:26:47,326 --> 00:26:48,668
I don't know, maybe.

415
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,068
I shouldn't go on tonight.

416
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:54,560
Are you kidding me?

417
00:26:55,063 --> 00:26:57,202
You have a sold-out house out there.

418
00:26:57,327 --> 00:26:58,311
Sold out!

419
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,910
When was the last
time that happened?

420
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:08,477
The other night...

421
00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:12,166
When I was doing the table of death,

422
00:27:13,478 --> 00:27:14,465
I was, um...

423
00:27:17,515 --> 00:27:18,928
... i was gonna kill myself.

424
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:23,459
And I have no idea
how I got out alive.

425
00:27:28,696 --> 00:27:29,814
But you did.

426
00:27:31,268 --> 00:27:32,692
Somehow, you did.

427
00:27:35,972 --> 00:27:38,349
When you were in your day,

428
00:27:38,474 --> 00:27:40,032
you were incredible.

429
00:27:40,819 --> 00:27:44,262
"The incredible jay."
You were the best I ever saw.

430
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:47,290
And now you got it back.

431
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,892
I don't know how,
but it doesn't matter.

432
00:27:51,773 --> 00:27:55,006
Just to see you
at the top of your game again,

433
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,049
hell, it mak me feel young.

434
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,485
- But...
- No buts, jay.

435
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:03,723
This may be mana from heaven,
I don't know,

436
00:28:04,824 --> 00:28:06,809
but whatever it is,

437
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,220
you don't throw it away.

438
00:29:28,474 --> 00:29:29,508
Jay.

439
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,521
- Thanks for dropping the charges.
- You mind telling us why you did it?

440
00:29:36,392 --> 00:29:37,650
We have to talk.

441
00:29:42,443 --> 00:29:44,156
I was just a kid when we first met.

442
00:29:45,215 --> 00:29:47,090
All I knew was how
to cheat at cards.

443
00:29:47,215 --> 00:29:50,037
Charlie got me out of more
scrapes than I can count.

444
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:56,775
Hell, I would have been dead by
the age of 20 if it hadn't been for him.

445
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,033
He was more than my friend.

446
00:30:03,632 --> 00:30:04,844
He was my brother.

447
00:30:06,961 --> 00:30:08,055
I'm sorry, jay.

448
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:11,327
Look, I should have listened
to you guys when you told me that

449
00:30:11,452 --> 00:30:12,954
my show was killing people.

450
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:15,396
Well, you weren't the one
pulling the trigger.

451
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:18,108
Yeah, but someone did, and I want
to find out who did this to charlie,

452
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,065
so I'll do whatever you guys say.

453
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,686
Just tell me what to do.

454
00:30:23,316 --> 00:30:25,698
Jay, whoever's doing this...

455
00:30:26,605 --> 00:30:27,533
They like you.

456
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,870
They're probably close to you.

457
00:30:32,445 --> 00:30:34,248
Did charlie and vernon get along?

458
00:30:35,438 --> 00:30:36,385
No.

459
00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:38,604
No, it's not vernon.

460
00:30:40,008 --> 00:30:41,881
He's the only one that makes sense.

461
00:30:43,554 --> 00:30:45,530
Charlie and vernon
were your family, jay.

462
00:30:45,655 --> 00:30:47,196
And now charlie's gone.

463
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:48,421
Yeah, but...

464
00:30:49,671 --> 00:30:53,330
they butted heads sometimes, but vernon
could never do something like this.

465
00:30:56,067 --> 00:30:58,023
See, the thing about real magic

466
00:30:58,587 --> 00:31:00,658
is it's a whole lot like crack.

467
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:03,736
People do surprising things
once they get a taste of it.

468
00:31:07,329 --> 00:31:09,604
You better be damn sure about this.

469
00:31:11,623 --> 00:31:13,734
Vernon's all I got left.

470
00:31:23,193 --> 00:31:24,013
Yeah?

471
00:31:25,222 --> 00:31:26,349
I'm okay.

472
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,208
Yeah, okay.

473
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:31,103
I'll be there in two shakes.

474
00:31:31,411 --> 00:31:33,235
I got something to tell you anyway.

475
00:31:56,784 --> 00:31:59,561
It's like a... magic museum.

476
00:32:00,217 --> 00:32:01,733
You must be in heaven.

477
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,796
This guy doesn't travel light.

478
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:05,893
He's been on
the road his whole life.

479
00:32:06,018 --> 00:32:07,840
Probably everything
he owns is in this room.

480
00:32:07,965 --> 00:32:09,285
Let's get started.

481
00:32:22,248 --> 00:32:24,059
Just talked to the head of
the convention.

482
00:32:24,184 --> 00:32:26,551
Headliner gig is yours.

483
00:32:30,978 --> 00:32:31,824
What?

484
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:34,034
You don't want it?

485
00:32:36,603 --> 00:32:39,770
A day ago, if you told me
I'd be standing on this stage...

486
00:32:42,475 --> 00:32:43,919
No, I can't do it, vernon.

487
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:46,005
What are you talking about?

488
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,013
Charlie's gone.

489
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:51,719
Charlie would have
wanted you to go on.

490
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:52,928
This is your shot.

491
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,763
It's our shot.

492
00:32:56,371 --> 00:32:57,109
Really?

493
00:32:58,246 --> 00:33:00,429
This is what charlie
would have wanted?

494
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:02,816
Charlie's dead.

495
00:33:04,344 --> 00:33:07,315
Hey, he was my friend,
too, you know.

496
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:10,205
It's a hell of a way
to treat a friend.

497
00:33:10,492 --> 00:33:12,541
Again, what are you talking about?

498
00:33:13,504 --> 00:33:15,016
You killed him, didn't you?

499
00:33:15,141 --> 00:33:16,517
And for what?

500
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:20,205
So that I...
So that we could be back on top?

501
00:33:20,534 --> 00:33:21,917
That's insane.

502
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,988
No, you're scaring me.

503
00:33:24,113 --> 00:33:26,281
First it was vance,
then it was jeb dexter.

504
00:33:26,406 --> 00:33:28,505
Even if you thought
you were doing it for me,

505
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:32,134
how in god's name
could you kill charlie?

506
00:33:33,518 --> 00:33:34,582
You are crazy.

507
00:33:34,707 --> 00:33:37,976
You used me,
and you used my act to do this to him.

508
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,562
- If you think...
- I wouldn't be so hard on him, jay.

509
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:42,937
He didn't do it.

510
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,622
This is just a bunch of
old-timey magic stuff.

511
00:33:48,747 --> 00:33:49,735
None of it magic.

512
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:53,238
No herbs, no candles,
and no tarot cards.

513
00:33:58,678 --> 00:33:59,662
I'll be damned.

514
00:34:00,301 --> 00:34:01,038
What?

515
00:34:03,547 --> 00:34:04,792
Look like anyone we know?

516
00:34:08,843 --> 00:34:10,532
Sweet mary and joseph.

517
00:34:13,934 --> 00:34:14,802
Charlie.

518
00:34:17,426 --> 00:34:18,729
It's really me, jay.

519
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:21,957
How the hell...

520
00:34:22,082 --> 00:34:25,025
god, you forget what it
feels like to be young.

521
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,575
It's amazing.

522
00:34:28,313 --> 00:34:30,614
- How old are you?
- It depends on what you mean by "old."

523
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,528
Right now, technically, about 28,

524
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:35,864
but I've been around
a lot longer than that.

525
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,117
How long?

526
00:34:38,896 --> 00:34:41,301
Long enough to have
shilled for barnum.

527
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,425
- And he gave me something.
- What's that?

528
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:46,083
The grimoire...
a book of real magic.

529
00:34:46,857 --> 00:34:48,488
At first, I thought it was a scam,

530
00:34:48,613 --> 00:34:50,729
but then I tried one of the spells,
and it worked.

531
00:34:50,854 --> 00:34:52,545
In fact, they all worked.

532
00:34:52,811 --> 00:34:55,676
So when I got to the end
and there was one for immortality...

533
00:34:56,142 --> 00:34:57,302
my god, charlie.

534
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:00,556
And my show,
the things that I can do.

535
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:01,929
Different spell.

536
00:35:02,054 --> 00:35:04,667
But it gives you a little
taste of what's possible.

537
00:35:08,234 --> 00:35:09,982
Oh, no,
I wouldn't touch those, vernon.

538
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,172
They're...
they're still radioactive.

539
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:16,670
You killed vance and jeb dexter.

540
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,074
What, you think this
is a parlor game?

541
00:35:19,683 --> 00:35:21,767
You were being humiliated
by those punks.

542
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,788
A washed-up old man
who couldn't even defend himself.

543
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,583
You us me to do these
terrible things.

544
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,752
I used them to give you a gift.

545
00:35:31,047 --> 00:35:33,380
And you wanted it, jay.
I saw it in your eyes.

546
00:35:35,261 --> 00:35:38,343
- No, I never wanted this.
- You were ready to kill yourself.

547
00:35:39,328 --> 00:35:40,679
I saved your life.

548
00:35:41,244 --> 00:35:42,669
Is that right, jay?

549
00:35:44,062 --> 00:35:46,645
I was there for you,
like I've always been.

550
00:35:48,552 --> 00:35:49,966
Like I'll always be.

551
00:35:50,837 --> 00:35:52,446
Come with me, both of you.

552
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,587
You think the first
time around was good?

553
00:35:54,712 --> 00:35:56,083
The second time's even better.

554
00:35:56,208 --> 00:35:58,405
All the know-how,
none of the aches and pain.

555
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,372
No, I won't do this.
I won't.

556
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:06,038
I've never made this offer before.

557
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:09,374
But, then again, I've nev had
friends like the two of you before.

558
00:36:10,111 --> 00:36:11,699
Let me do this for you.

559
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:15,923
And who else has to die
so that we can live forever?

560
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,431
What's the price tag on immortality?

561
00:36:20,296 --> 00:36:22,554
This isn't right, charlie,
what you're doing. You know that.

562
00:36:22,988 --> 00:36:24,915
Somewhere, you know that.

563
00:36:25,437 --> 00:36:27,650
I know I don't want
to come back alone,

564
00:36:28,266 --> 00:36:30,407
to start all over, alone.

565
00:36:31,734 --> 00:36:32,748
Jay...

566
00:36:33,712 --> 00:36:35,275
we can be young again.

567
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,654
The three of us together...
vital and alive...

568
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,266
forever.

569
00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:42,459
Not so fast!

570
00:36:43,621 --> 00:36:45,619
I ain't guttenberg,
and this ain't "cocoon."

571
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:56,795
Immortality.

572
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:59,745
- That's a neat trick.
- It's not a trick.

573
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,219
It's magic.

574
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,977
Hey, bullet catch...
been working on that.

575
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:12,855
Get him!

576
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:18,102
Let him go... now!

577
00:37:18,686 --> 00:37:20,688
Just leave me and my friends alone.

578
00:37:20,813 --> 00:37:22,777
- I said now!
- All right, I will give it up...

579
00:37:22,902 --> 00:37:24,157
the spells, the hexes.

580
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,427
This is the last time.
I promise.

581
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,419
Jay...

582
00:38:27,123 --> 00:38:29,255
You picked these strangers over me?

583
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:52,955
You okay?

584
00:38:53,728 --> 00:38:54,671
Yeah.

585
00:38:55,368 --> 00:38:56,782
Yeah, I'm all right.

586
00:39:30,547 --> 00:39:32,494
We wanted to thank you for

587
00:39:33,017 --> 00:39:34,746
what you did yesterday.

588
00:39:35,629 --> 00:39:38,917
I killed my best friend yesterday,
and you want to thank me?

589
00:39:46,277 --> 00:39:47,926
- Where's vernon?
- Oh, he's gone.

590
00:39:48,558 --> 00:39:51,683
He said he didn't want to speak to
me again after what I did to charlie.

591
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,393
Listen, jay...

592
00:39:56,869 --> 00:39:59,187
you know charlie was never
gonna give up what he was doing.

593
00:40:00,055 --> 00:40:00,814
Ever.

594
00:40:01,798 --> 00:40:03,253
You did the right thing.

595
00:40:03,929 --> 00:40:05,507
Are you sure about that?

596
00:40:05,877 --> 00:40:07,738
You know,
charlie was like my brother.

597
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:10,887
And now he's dead...

598
00:40:11,881 --> 00:40:13,644
because I did "the right thing."

599
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:19,085
He offered me a gift,
and I just threw it back in his face.

600
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,480
So now I have to spend
the rest of my life old and alone.

601
00:40:30,993 --> 00:40:32,776
What's so right about that?

602
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:39,227
Jay...

603
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,772
your cards.

604
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:46,443
Throw them away.

605
00:40:56,003 --> 00:40:57,412
I don't know about you, but...

606
00:40:58,775 --> 00:41:00,082
I could go for a beer.

607
00:41:02,828 --> 00:41:04,211
I'm gonna take a walk.

608
00:41:26,808 --> 00:41:27,792
Okay.

609
00:41:28,356 --> 00:41:29,452
I'm in.

610
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:35,991
What changed your mind?

611
00:41:38,522 --> 00:41:40,622
I don't want to be doing
this when I'm an old man.
