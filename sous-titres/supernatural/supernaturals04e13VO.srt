1
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:04,673
When I told Dad I was scared
of the thing in my closet, 

2
00:00:04,798 --> 00:00:06,881
- He gave me a.45
- What was he supposed to do?

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,758
I was 9 years old.

4
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:10,176
The training,

5
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,467
and melting the sliver into bullets?

6
00:00:12,592 --> 00:00:14,847
Man, Dean, we were raised
like warriors.

7
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:17,754
Lock the doors and windows,
close the shades.

8
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:18,934
And most important

9
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,656
Watch out for sammy.

10
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:25,691
I don't understand the blind
faith you have in the man.

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,234
It's called being a good son.

12
00:00:27,614 --> 00:00:28,944
Dad's gonna be here, right?

13
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:31,030
He'll be here.
Promise.

14
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:32,782
- Where is he, anyway?
- On business.

15
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,912
- And that's why you ran away.
- I was just going to college.

16
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,942
It was dad who said if I was gonna go,
I should stay gone.

17
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:42,907
Your brother and me...
We needed you.

18
00:00:43,032 --> 00:00:44,460
You walked away, sam.

19
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:45,767
You walked away!

20
00:00:45,892 --> 00:00:48,144
You're the one who said,
"don't come back," dad.

21
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:49,882
You closed that door, not me!

22
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,926
This is never the life
that I wanted for you.

23
00:00:55,946 --> 00:00:58,265
Look, I'm sure dad would
have been here if he could.

24
00:01:04,493 --> 00:01:05,804
She's such a slut.

25
00:01:06,839 --> 00:01:07,775
So?

26
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,819
Personally, i'm very pro-slut.

27
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:13,579
What happened, anyway?

28
00:01:13,704 --> 00:01:16,032
She totally banged jamie jaffe,
that's what.

29
00:01:16,157 --> 00:01:18,244
She gave him the reverse
cowgirl and everything.

30
00:01:19,987 --> 00:01:22,274
Hi, taylor.
How was your weekend?

31
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:23,455
Fine, I guess.

32
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,127
You didn't...
Go to the rodeo?

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,004
That's my spot.

34
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,479
Sorry.
This is a skeev-free zone.

35
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:34,922
Slut!

36
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:36,931
- Slut!
- Good bye...

37
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:38,775
Slut!

38
00:01:39,114 --> 00:01:40,078
Slut!

39
00:01:40,293 --> 00:01:41,308
Slut!

40
00:01:56,345 --> 00:01:58,286
You shouldn't listen to those jerks.

41
00:01:58,411 --> 00:01:59,535
Leave me alone.

42
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,208
I just mean...

43
00:02:01,793 --> 00:02:03,525
I'm sorry, that's all.

44
00:02:05,831 --> 00:02:06,667
You?

45
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:07,993
You're sorry?

46
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,839
Don't you feel sorry for me,
you fat, ugly pig.

47
00:02:42,926 --> 00:02:44,402
You think I'm ugly?

48
00:02:44,617 --> 00:02:45,396
Look,

49
00:02:45,724 --> 00:02:47,552
I'm sorry about yesterday.

50
00:02:47,677 --> 00:02:48,918
I didn't mean it, okay?

51
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,358
I'm not ugly.

52
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:51,981
You'reugly.

53
00:04:11,373 --> 00:04:13,402
I'm not talking about it anymore.

54
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,450
I already told the cops
and the doctors.

55
00:04:15,575 --> 00:04:16,928
No one believes me.

56
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,757
They think I'm crazy.

57
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:21,857
Well, I'm a little bit more
open-minded than most.

58
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,054
April, why did you tell
the police you were possessed?

59
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:27,224
It doesn't matter.

60
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,742
It matters to me.

61
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,868
When I...

62
00:04:37,873 --> 00:04:41,245
When I hurt taylor, I was there,
in my head,

63
00:04:42,245 --> 00:04:44,158
but I couldn't control my body.

64
00:04:46,727 --> 00:04:49,078
I could see what I was doing,

65
00:04:49,514 --> 00:04:51,092
but I couldn't stop.

66
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:54,376
I just wanted to stop.

67
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,421
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,006
You don't need to apologize.

69
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:02,640
April, some of the kids at school told
the police

70
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:04,492
that you and taylor
didn't get along.

71
00:05:04,617 --> 00:05:07,076
Well, yeah, but I never wanted
to kill her.

72
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:08,052
Never.

73
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:10,684
Do you believe me?

74
00:05:11,993 --> 00:05:13,020
Yeah, I do.

75
00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:17,429
Just a couple more questions.

76
00:05:17,554 --> 00:05:20,361
On the day this happened, did you...
Happen to smell anything?

77
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:22,692
Anything...

78
00:05:23,337 --> 00:05:24,311
Like what?

79
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,077
Like rotten eggs or...

80
00:05:27,723 --> 00:05:28,494
Sulfur?

81
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,469
Um, no.

82
00:05:31,084 --> 00:05:32,414
Okay.

83
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,560
Did you...

84
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:36,126
notice any black smoke?

85
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,004
What are you, crazy?

86
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:55,003
So?

87
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,371
I think she's telling the truth.

88
00:05:57,496 --> 00:06:00,943
I mean, the way she talked about being
there mentally but not physically...

89
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,403
Kind of sounds like
demonic possession to me.

90
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:04,279
Kind of?

91
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,131
She didn't see any black
smoke or smell sulfur.

92
00:06:07,684 --> 00:06:10,061
Maybe it's not a demon.
I mean, kids can be vicious.

93
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:12,371
We're already here.
Might as well check out the school.

94
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,582
Right. The school.

95
00:06:16,485 --> 00:06:17,292
What?

96
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,878
Truman high, home of the bombers.

97
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,339
- What's your point?
- I don't know.

98
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,973
We went there, like...
For a month a million years ago.

99
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:26,979
- Why are you so jazzed to go back?
- I'm not.

100
00:06:27,104 --> 00:06:28,745
I just think it's
worth looking into.

101
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,637
All right, well, what's our cover?
Fbi?

102
00:06:30,762 --> 00:06:33,244
Homeland security?
Swedish exchange students?

103
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:34,447
Don't worry.

104
00:06:35,964 --> 00:06:37,142
I got an idea.

105
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:39,787
Okay.

106
00:07:14,136 --> 00:07:15,261
Got your lunch?

107
00:07:15,386 --> 00:07:17,102
Books?
Butterfly knife?

108
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,059
- Yeah, dean.
- You okay?

109
00:07:19,184 --> 00:07:20,064
Sure.

110
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,182
Sammy...

111
00:07:24,553 --> 00:07:27,638
This is the third school we've been to
this year, and it's only november.

112
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,637
I'm just sick of being the new kid.

113
00:07:29,762 --> 00:07:30,699
You'll be fine.

114
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,951
If anyone gives you any trouble,
you let me know.

115
00:07:34,775 --> 00:07:37,737
Relax. Dad said this hunt
will take him two weeks, tops.

116
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,072
As soon as he gets back,
we're out of here.

117
00:07:40,197 --> 00:07:41,293
To another school.

118
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,384
Awesome.

119
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:53,764
Ladies and gentlemen,
please say hello to Sam Winchester.

120
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:55,641
Hi, sam.

121
00:07:56,094 --> 00:07:56,922
Class,

122
00:07:57,047 --> 00:08:00,265
say hello to our new student,
Dean Winchester.

123
00:08:02,517 --> 00:08:04,900
Dean, is there anything you'd
like to tell us about yourself?

124
00:08:05,998 --> 00:08:07,319
Not really, sweetheart.

125
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:09,154
Take your seat.

126
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:11,782
Is there anything you'd like
to tell us about yourself?

127
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:13,784
Not really.

128
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:15,747
Okay. Grab a seat.

129
00:08:34,295 --> 00:08:35,889
Whoa, that's yours?

130
00:08:37,923 --> 00:08:38,937
Awesome!

131
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,897
Where are your books?

132
00:08:44,369 --> 00:08:45,502
Don't need 'em, sugar.

133
00:08:45,627 --> 00:08:47,317
Not gonna be here
long enough anyway.

134
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,025
All right, gang...

135
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:57,411
Essay assignment.

136
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,328
Yeah, yeah, my heart breaks for you.

137
00:09:05,356 --> 00:09:06,336
I'm barry.

138
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,380
... on your most memorable
family experience.

139
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,225
Just a reminder, though

140
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,207
this is going to be worth
half your final grade.

141
00:09:16,332 --> 00:09:17,347
Leave him alone.

142
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:20,307
I'm going for a record.

143
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,979
I said, "leave him alone."

144
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,985
You want to take his place...
midget?

145
00:09:32,665 --> 00:09:34,417
Yeah. Sure.

146
00:09:36,223 --> 00:09:38,570
Okay eveybody,
if you have any questions?

147
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,490
Alright, let's get started,
good luck.

148
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:02,343
Today, you will have the honor

149
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:05,520
of playing one of the greatest games
ever invented.

150
00:10:06,003 --> 00:10:08,315
A game of skill, agility,

151
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:09,477
cunning.

152
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,110
A game with one simple rule...

153
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,407
... dodge.

154
00:10:21,313 --> 00:10:22,215
Sorry.

155
00:10:22,943 --> 00:10:24,983
Uh, Substitute coach roth...

156
00:10:25,987 --> 00:10:26,751
Yes?

157
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,522
Ms. Boudreaux never
let us play dodge ball.

158
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,799
Well, ms. B's in massachusetts
getting married, so we're playing.

159
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,130
- She says it's dangerous.
- Take a lap!

160
00:10:36,255 --> 00:10:37,120
But...

161
00:10:45,153 --> 00:10:46,342
Go nuts.

162
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:52,567
Having fun?

163
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:55,445
The whistle makes me their god.

164
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,467
Right.

165
00:10:56,764 --> 00:10:57,781
Nice shorts.

166
00:10:58,178 --> 00:10:59,199
Find anything?

167
00:11:00,586 --> 00:11:02,995
I've been over the entire school twice.
No sulfur.

168
00:11:03,752 --> 00:11:06,003
No sulfur, no demon.
No demon, no case.

169
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:07,754
I don't know.
Maybe I was wrong.

170
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:10,255
It happens to the best of us.
I say we hit the road?

171
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,296
But after lunch.
It's sloppy-joe day.

172
00:11:17,253 --> 00:11:18,385
Good hustle, colby!

173
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:20,138
Walk it off!

174
00:11:34,074 --> 00:11:36,472
I need to copy
your algebra homework again.

175
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:41,753
Why?

176
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:44,639
'cause you're a stupid,
brain-dead dick?

177
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:52,627
I'm gonna shove my fist down
your throat, you little freak.

178
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,173
That fist?

179
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:21,531
What happened?

180
00:12:36,942 --> 00:12:38,795
How's the nonviolence
assembly going?

181
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,884
Apparently, shoving a kid's arm
into a cuisinart

182
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,112
is not a "healthy display of anger."

183
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,637
So, the kid had ectoplasm
leaking out his ear?

184
00:12:45,762 --> 00:12:47,946
Which only comes from
a seriously pissed-off spirit.

185
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:50,852
- It's got to be ghost possession.
- Yeah, but that's pretty rare.

186
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,028
But it happens.

187
00:12:52,153 --> 00:12:55,148
I mean, they get angry enough, they can
take control of a person's body.

188
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:57,571
All right, so, what,
we got a ghost in the building?

189
00:12:57,696 --> 00:13:00,120
Yeah, but where?
I mean, there's no emf.

190
00:13:00,497 --> 00:13:02,291
Maybe we could find out who it is,
at least.

191
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,781
Check and see if somebody
died bloody around here or something.

192
00:13:04,906 --> 00:13:05,970
Way ahead of you.

193
00:13:06,095 --> 00:13:08,453
I had to break into
the principal's office to get this.

194
00:13:09,077 --> 00:13:10,776
Oh, and fyi,

195
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:13,572
3 of the cheerleaders are legal.
Guess which ones.

196
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:19,585
There was only one death on campus.

197
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,331
It was a suicide back in'98.
Some kid named barry cook.

198
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:25,053
What?

199
00:13:27,342 --> 00:13:28,181
I knew him.

200
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,635
How did he die?

201
00:13:30,134 --> 00:13:32,727
He slit his wrists in
the first-floor girls' bathroom.

202
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:35,520
That's where...

203
00:13:35,645 --> 00:13:38,236
Right where the chick got
swirleyed to death, exactly.

204
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:41,759
So, what?
This ghost is possessing nerds?

205
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:43,738
And using them to go
after bullies, yeah.

206
00:13:44,097 --> 00:13:45,982
Well, does that sound
like barry's M. O?

207
00:13:48,052 --> 00:13:49,620
Barry had a hard time.

208
00:14:05,288 --> 00:14:07,237
- Thanks, sam.
- Great school.

209
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:09,938
I don't care.
Three years, and I'm out of here.

210
00:14:10,063 --> 00:14:11,454
I'm going to michigan state.

211
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,435
They got the best vet
program in the country.

212
00:14:13,906 --> 00:14:15,361
Do you like animals?

213
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,282
They're a lot nicer than people.

214
00:14:33,817 --> 00:14:36,082
So tonight i'm thinking you,

215
00:14:36,328 --> 00:14:38,418
me, a bucket of popcorn,
extra butter...

216
00:14:38,787 --> 00:14:40,068
Mm, kinky.

217
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:44,687
... and the midnight screening
of "i spit on your grave"

218
00:14:44,812 --> 00:14:45,800
at the cinedome.

219
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:48,800
I can't.

220
00:14:49,732 --> 00:14:51,088
I have a curfew...

221
00:14:51,382 --> 00:14:52,182
At 11:00.

222
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:54,100
So?

223
00:14:55,338 --> 00:14:58,772
So if I break it,
my folks will ground me for a month.

224
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,604
Yeah, parents.
Terrifying.

225
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:02,952
When's your curfew?

226
00:15:03,077 --> 00:15:04,344
I don't have one.

227
00:15:09,878 --> 00:15:11,209
Your parents just

228
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:13,662
let you stay out all night,
don't they?

229
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:17,915
My dad's out of town on a job.
It's just me and my brother.

230
00:15:18,612 --> 00:15:19,832
For how long?

231
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:21,378
Couple of weeks.

232
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:25,382
Seriously?

233
00:15:26,021 --> 00:15:28,870
Yeah, we got a pretty
sweet setup at the pines.

234
00:15:31,945 --> 00:15:32,764
The motel?

235
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:36,977
Hbo, magic fingers, free ice...
It's great.

236
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:40,926
I guess.

237
00:15:41,623 --> 00:15:43,525
What? I do whatever I want,
whenever I want.

238
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:44,738
It's perfect.

239
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:47,966
But...

240
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,240
Don't you miss your dad?

241
00:16:02,138 --> 00:16:03,191
Yo! Sammy!

242
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:06,186
That's your brother
with amanda heckerling?

243
00:16:06,944 --> 00:16:08,004
He's cool.

244
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:09,884
Yeah.
He thinks so.

245
00:16:12,601 --> 00:16:13,638
Hey, tough guy.

246
00:16:14,312 --> 00:16:15,870
I been looking for you.

247
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:17,879
Still want to take barry's place?

248
00:16:18,004 --> 00:16:20,353
- Get out of here, barry.
- I'll go get a teacher.

249
00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:23,732
- You want to go?
- I'm not gonna fight you, dirk.

250
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:25,442
Why not?
You chicken?

251
00:16:28,003 --> 00:16:29,552
- Come on!
- No.

252
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,367
Get up! Get up!

253
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:36,369
- Come on! Get up!
- hey, get back!

254
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,594
Get back.

255
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,818
That is enough.

256
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,569
So long, barry cook.

257
00:17:30,372 --> 00:17:31,581
You all right?

258
00:17:33,877 --> 00:17:35,118
Barry was my friend.

259
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:37,055
I just burned his bones.

260
00:17:39,543 --> 00:17:41,326
Well, he's at peace now, sam.

261
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:45,096
I mean, if dad had let us stay
just a little while longer,

262
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:47,023
maybe I could have helped
the kid, you know?

263
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:49,984
You read the coroner's
report same as me.

264
00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:54,069
Barry was on every anxiety drug
and antidepressant known to man.

265
00:17:54,464 --> 00:17:56,166
School was hell for that kid.

266
00:17:56,494 --> 00:17:58,123
His parents had split up.

267
00:17:58,461 --> 00:17:59,661
He just wanted out.

268
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,493
It was tragic,
but it's not your fault.

269
00:18:06,045 --> 00:18:07,550
To tell you the truth,

270
00:18:08,042 --> 00:18:10,902
I'm glad we got out of that town.
I hated that school.

271
00:18:13,627 --> 00:18:14,759
It wasn't all bad.

272
00:18:15,943 --> 00:18:18,609
How can you say that after
what happened to you?

273
00:18:26,447 --> 00:18:27,564
That kid's dead.

274
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,069
I'm gonna rip his lungs out!

275
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:32,326
- It's not a big deal.
- Not a big deal?

276
00:18:32,451 --> 00:18:34,321
Sammy, look at yourself.
If dad was here...

277
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,238
He's not.

278
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,866
Well, I am! And as soon as
I'm finished with that dick...

279
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,242
Shut up, okay?!

280
00:18:42,176 --> 00:18:43,470
I don't need your help.

281
00:18:43,702 --> 00:18:46,212
That's right, you don't.
You could have torn him apart.

282
00:18:46,337 --> 00:18:47,464
So why didn't you?

283
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:50,003
Because I don't want to be
the freak for once, dean.

284
00:18:51,706 --> 00:18:53,006
I want to be normal.

285
00:18:53,602 --> 00:18:55,805
So taking a beating...
That's normal?

286
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,928
Any word from dad?

287
00:19:02,486 --> 00:19:05,518
He called this morning, said he's
going to be another week at least.

288
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,127
We weren't supposed
to be here this long.

289
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,320
At least you've got amanda.

290
00:19:12,222 --> 00:19:13,151
She's cool.

291
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,715
Dude, she wants me
to meet her parents.

292
00:19:18,442 --> 00:19:19,824
I don't do parents.

293
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:35,607
Mr. Winchester, can I talk to you?

294
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:43,973
I'll wait for you outside.

295
00:19:47,474 --> 00:19:50,605
Look, if this is about the fight,
I didn't start it.

296
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,018
Oh, no,
it's not about the fight, sam.

297
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:58,321
You know this assignment
was nonfiction, right?

298
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:01,207
Yes, Mr. Wyatt.

299
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,536
So you and your family killed
a werewolf last summer, huh?

300
00:20:09,764 --> 00:20:11,668
Why would you write
something like this, sam?

301
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:13,785
It doesn't matter.

302
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,047
As soon as my dad gets back,
we're leaving, so...

303
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:19,099
- You can flunk me if you want to.
- I'm not flunking you.

304
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:20,802
I'm giving you an "a."

305
00:20:26,354 --> 00:20:27,725
Now, aside from the werewolf,

306
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,103
is that really how you'd describe
your family?

307
00:20:31,192 --> 00:20:32,105
Yeah.

308
00:20:33,344 --> 00:20:35,920
Well, your brother
is quite a character.

309
00:20:36,131 --> 00:20:38,528
And your father...
He seems, uh, driven.

310
00:20:39,347 --> 00:20:41,239
Anyway, it's good, sam.
It's really good.

311
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:44,137
Have you ever thought
about pursuing writing?

312
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,386
I can't.

313
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,620
I have to go into
the family business.

314
00:20:48,762 --> 00:20:49,831
Family business?

315
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,434
Yeah, my dad's a m...

316
00:20:53,602 --> 00:20:57,015
My dad's a mechanic.
So I have to be a mechanic, too.

317
00:20:57,507 --> 00:21:00,003
Do you want to go in
the family business, sam?

318
00:21:02,426 --> 00:21:04,012
No one's ever asked me that before.

319
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:05,597
Well?

320
00:21:07,448 --> 00:21:09,251
More than anything, no.

321
00:21:13,043 --> 00:21:13,843
Well...

322
00:21:14,888 --> 00:21:17,499
I don't want to overstep
my bounds here, but...

323
00:21:20,391 --> 00:21:23,387
... you don't have to do
anything you don't want to do.

324
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,909
Look, I mean, I know what it's like.

325
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,912
I come from a family of surgeons,
and that wasn't me.

326
00:21:30,361 --> 00:21:32,071
So, you know, I traded in

327
00:21:32,196 --> 00:21:34,174
the money and prestige
of being a doctor

328
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:36,336
for all the glamour
you see around you.

329
00:21:38,017 --> 00:21:39,088
But the point is...

330
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,182
There may be three or four

331
00:21:41,307 --> 00:21:44,038
big choices that shape someone's
whole life,

332
00:21:44,376 --> 00:21:46,262
and you need to be the one
that makes them,

333
00:21:46,928 --> 00:21:48,375
not anyone else.

334
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,648
You seem like a great kid, sam.

335
00:21:53,642 --> 00:21:55,815
Just live the life you want to live.

336
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:12,077
We came back here so you
could talk to a teacher?

337
00:22:12,202 --> 00:22:13,636
He's a good guy.

338
00:22:14,927 --> 00:22:16,138
Well, whatever.

339
00:22:16,263 --> 00:22:19,262
Go have your robin williams
"o captain! My captain!" Moment.

340
00:22:19,387 --> 00:22:20,821
Just make it quick.

341
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,452
Excuse me, sir.

342
00:22:47,577 --> 00:22:49,700
Can you tell me how
to find room 305?

343
00:22:50,141 --> 00:22:51,360
Sure. Um...

344
00:22:52,015 --> 00:22:54,997
Head down the hall,
take your first right, and it's the...

345
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,166
third door on the left.

346
00:23:01,073 --> 00:23:02,046
Thanks, sam.

347
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:08,720
You got tall, winchester.

348
00:23:42,557 --> 00:23:44,289
Trust me.
This will help.

349
00:23:49,832 --> 00:23:51,179
That ghost is dead.

350
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,153
I'm gonna rip its lungs out!

351
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,933
Well, you know what I mean.

352
00:23:56,657 --> 00:23:57,935
It knew my name, dean.

353
00:23:58,533 --> 00:23:59,732
My real name.

354
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,945
We burned barry's bones.

355
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:04,138
What the hell?

356
00:24:04,263 --> 00:24:06,235
Maybe it wasn't barry.
Maybe we missed something.

357
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,993
We just got to go back.

358
00:24:16,302 --> 00:24:17,163
No way.

359
00:24:17,892 --> 00:24:19,832
- How did we not see this before?
- What?

360
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,182
Check it out.

361
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:25,642
Look, martha dumptruck, revenge
of the nerds, and hello kitty...

362
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:27,267
They all rode the same bus.

363
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,883
Okay, so maybe the bus is haunted.

364
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:32,220
That would explain why there's no
emf at the school, but not the attacks.

365
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,975
Ghosts are tied to
the places that they haunt.

366
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,349
They can't just bail.

367
00:24:39,977 --> 00:24:41,062
Unless this one can.

368
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:45,702
There's lore about spirits possessing
people and riding them for miles.

369
00:24:45,827 --> 00:24:47,704
Then whenever they leave
the body, they're...

370
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:49,618
they're bungeed back
to their usual haunt.

371
00:24:49,743 --> 00:24:51,145
But until then,

372
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,268
the ghosts can go
wherever they want.

373
00:24:53,393 --> 00:24:56,494
So a spook just grabs a kid on
the bus and walks right into truman?

374
00:24:57,203 --> 00:24:58,120
It's possible.

375
00:24:58,946 --> 00:25:00,769
Ghosts getting creative...
That's super.

376
00:25:06,862 --> 00:25:08,214
Definitely ain't clean.

377
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,868
Here, ghosty, ghosty, ghosty!

378
00:25:10,993 --> 00:25:12,747
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

379
00:25:12,872 --> 00:25:13,803
I don't get it.

380
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,889
No one ever died on this bus, and it's
not like there's a body hidden in here.

381
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:18,766
Yeah, but a flap of skin, a hair,

382
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,908
hell, a hangnail, something's got to be
tying the ghost to this place.

383
00:25:22,033 --> 00:25:23,684
We just got to find it.

384
00:25:45,018 --> 00:25:46,502
Got a new driving permit.

385
00:25:47,027 --> 00:25:48,595
Issued two weeks ago.

386
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,395
- Just before the first attack.
- Yeah.

387
00:25:52,816 --> 00:25:55,052
Name of the bus driver
is dirk mcgregor sr.

388
00:25:55,613 --> 00:25:57,697
39 north central avenue.

389
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:58,821
Mcgregor?

390
00:26:00,284 --> 00:26:01,058
Why?

391
00:26:02,837 --> 00:26:04,061
I knew his son.

392
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:07,981
Did you know everybody
at this school?

393
00:26:17,153 --> 00:26:18,743
Got to watch where
you're going, man.

394
00:26:19,223 --> 00:26:20,453
Leave him alone, dirk.

395
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,599
You never learn, do you, midget?

396
00:26:26,027 --> 00:26:27,472
Get to the bus, barry.

397
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,305
What's the matter?
You scared?

398
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:41,546
Don't worry.

399
00:26:41,671 --> 00:26:43,483
I'll go easy on you this time.

400
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:46,228
Come on, lose-chester.
Let's see what you got.

401
00:26:46,582 --> 00:26:47,761
Come on, freak!

402
00:26:48,314 --> 00:26:49,315
Freak!

403
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,635
You're not tough.

404
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,097
You're just a jerk.

405
00:27:20,162 --> 00:27:21,389
"Dirk the jerk."

406
00:27:35,615 --> 00:27:37,136
So, you were friends with dirk?

407
00:27:37,261 --> 00:27:39,233
Yes, sir, in high school.

408
00:27:39,664 --> 00:27:42,584
I don't recall dirk having
many friends at truman.

409
00:27:42,943 --> 00:27:44,761
Here, sit.
Sit down.

410
00:27:46,644 --> 00:27:48,457
When did, uh... When did dirk pass?

411
00:27:48,889 --> 00:27:49,834
He was 18.

412
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,410
What happened to him?

413
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,963
Well, there was, first, drinking,

414
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,506
then drugs,

415
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,299
and too many drugs then. 

416
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:01,370
He just slipped through my fingers.

417
00:28:03,573 --> 00:28:04,932
It was my fault.

418
00:28:06,326 --> 00:28:08,102
I should have seen it coming,
you know?

419
00:28:08,758 --> 00:28:11,522
Dirk, he, uh...
Well, he had his troubles.

420
00:28:11,987 --> 00:28:13,432
What kind of troubles?

421
00:28:14,273 --> 00:28:16,395
School was never easy for dirk.

422
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:19,071
We didn't have much money, and,

423
00:28:19,971 --> 00:28:22,075
Well, you know, kids...
They can be cruel.

424
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,414
They picked on him.

425
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:25,578
They picked onhim?

426
00:28:28,804 --> 00:28:30,721
They called him poor and dirty

427
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:32,501
and stupid.

428
00:28:32,842 --> 00:28:35,046
They even had a nickname for him...

429
00:28:35,989 --> 00:28:37,270
Dirk the jerk.

430
00:28:39,268 --> 00:28:41,263
And after what happened
to his mother, he...

431
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:42,388
His mother?

432
00:28:43,408 --> 00:28:44,946
Yeah, jane, my wife.

433
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:48,020
She died when dirk was 13.

434
00:28:48,762 --> 00:28:49,602
Cancer.

435
00:28:50,899 --> 00:28:52,480
I was working three jobs, so...

436
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,558
it fell to dirk to take care of her.

437
00:28:55,013 --> 00:28:56,817
And he was a great kid.

438
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,641
He made sure jane got her medicine.

439
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:01,214
He helped her, cleaned up after her.

440
00:29:02,511 --> 00:29:03,765
But, you know, you...

441
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,659
You watch somebody die slow,

442
00:29:06,594 --> 00:29:08,818
waste away to nothing...

443
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:11,388
It does things to a person.

444
00:29:13,763 --> 00:29:15,003
Horrible things.

445
00:29:16,427 --> 00:29:18,237
I didn't know about his mother.

446
00:29:19,123 --> 00:29:21,141
He wouldn't talk about her,

447
00:29:21,828 --> 00:29:22,927
not even to me.

448
00:29:26,644 --> 00:29:28,171
Lot of anger in that boy.

449
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:32,103
I'm sorry.

450
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:37,833
Well, we'd really like to pay
our respects, Mr. Mcgregor.

451
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:41,153
You mind telling us
where dirk is buried?

452
00:29:41,963 --> 00:29:44,406
Oh, he wasn't.
I had him cremated.

453
00:29:46,712 --> 00:29:47,618
All of him?

454
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:55,167
Well, I kept a lock of his hair.

455
00:29:56,068 --> 00:29:57,144
Oh, that's...

456
00:29:57,626 --> 00:29:58,784
That's nice.

457
00:29:59,112 --> 00:30:00,649
Where do you keep that?

458
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,636
On my bus, in my bible.

459
00:30:28,195 --> 00:30:29,702
Thanks for subbing tonight, eddie.

460
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:31,638
My pleasure, coach.

461
00:30:43,545 --> 00:30:45,801
Eddie, you want to ease
up on the pedal, there?

462
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:48,690
I got it all under control.

463
00:30:54,233 --> 00:30:55,668
What the hell was that?

464
00:31:03,568 --> 00:31:04,653
Everyone okay?

465
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,578
Dirk!

466
00:31:31,237 --> 00:31:32,306
Winchester.

467
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:35,017
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

468
00:31:35,469 --> 00:31:36,535
Don't need to.

469
00:31:38,411 --> 00:31:39,980
That rope is soaked in salt water.

470
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,885
You're not going anywhere.

471
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:47,363
All right, everybody stay where you are.
You'll be okay.

472
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,202
Aren't you the P. E Teacher?

473
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,660
Not really.
I'm like "21 jump street."

474
00:31:55,206 --> 00:31:56,887
The bus driver sells pot.

475
00:32:06,796 --> 00:32:07,841
It's not here!

476
00:32:09,235 --> 00:32:11,797
- Where is it?
- No way you'll ever find it.

477
00:32:15,291 --> 00:32:16,394
Where is it?!

478
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:17,925
Sam winchester.

479
00:32:18,893 --> 00:32:20,062
Still a bully.

480
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:21,188
You,

481
00:32:21,594 --> 00:32:22,940
you jocks...

482
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,192
You popular kids...

483
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,362
You always thought you were
better than everybody else.

484
00:32:29,054 --> 00:32:31,699
And to you,
I was just dirk the jerk, right?

485
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,577
Now you evil sons of bitches are
gonna get what's coming to you.

486
00:32:36,146 --> 00:32:37,371
I'm not evil, dirk.

487
00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:42,501
I'm not.

488
00:32:43,268 --> 00:32:44,586
And neither were you.

489
00:32:45,277 --> 00:32:46,189
Trust me.

490
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:48,812
I've seen real evil.

491
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:53,178
We were scared and miserable,
and we took it out on each other...

492
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,180
Us and everybody else.

493
00:32:55,523 --> 00:32:57,020
That's high school.

494
00:32:58,802 --> 00:33:01,057
But you suffer through that,

495
00:33:01,323 --> 00:33:02,396
and it gets better.

496
00:33:04,141 --> 00:33:07,021
I'm just sorry you didn't
get a chance to see that...

497
00:33:08,209 --> 00:33:09,460
You or barry.

498
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,656
Nothing is gonna get better for me.

499
00:33:14,103 --> 00:33:15,322
Not ever.

500
00:33:45,164 --> 00:33:47,254
Dean! Find the hair!

501
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,792
Hey, buddy,
this isn't what it looks like.

502
00:34:38,101 --> 00:34:38,992
Little help?

503
00:34:44,711 --> 00:34:46,596
He's giving you the full cowgirl.

504
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:04,459
Five more minutes, jerry.

505
00:35:09,701 --> 00:35:10,750
Amanda, hey!

506
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:15,487
Gettysburg address, 1863, right?

507
00:35:22,391 --> 00:35:24,413
History test next period.
We're studying.

508
00:35:26,438 --> 00:35:28,500
Come on, baby.
She means nothing to me.

509
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,731
Don't be mad.

510
00:35:31,135 --> 00:35:32,754
I'm not mad, dean.

511
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:34,673
I thought maybe...

512
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:37,693
underneath your whole
"I could give a crap,"

513
00:35:37,818 --> 00:35:40,819
baboy thing, that there was something
more going on.

514
00:35:41,895 --> 00:35:44,550
I mean, like the way you
are with your brother.

515
00:35:46,322 --> 00:35:47,311
But I was wrong.

516
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,144
And you spend

517
00:35:50,269 --> 00:35:53,719
And you spend so much time trying
to convince people that you're cool

518
00:35:53,844 --> 00:35:55,444
but it's just an act.

519
00:35:56,027 --> 00:35:59,031
We both know
that you're just a sad...

520
00:36:00,002 --> 00:36:01,658
lonely little kid.

521
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,368
And I feel sorry for you, dean.

522
00:36:05,843 --> 00:36:07,647
You feel sorry for me, huh?

523
00:36:08,497 --> 00:36:10,000
Don't feel sorry for me.

524
00:36:10,424 --> 00:36:12,586
You don't know anything about me.

525
00:36:13,202 --> 00:36:15,445
I save lives.
I'm a hero.

526
00:36:16,296 --> 00:36:17,382
A hero!

527
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,011
What?

528
00:36:25,796 --> 00:36:26,605
What?!

529
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:00,954
Dad?

530
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:03,554
Finally.

531
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,017
I can't wait to get out of here.
This place sucks.

532
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:22,646
Come on, sam.

533
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:01,853
Uh, Mr. Wyatt?

534
00:38:02,642 --> 00:38:03,530
Yes.

535
00:38:06,024 --> 00:38:08,284
You probably don't remember me,

536
00:38:08,688 --> 00:38:11,753
but my name is Sam Winchester, and

537
00:38:12,593 --> 00:38:14,166
I just wanted to thank you.

538
00:38:15,015 --> 00:38:16,001
For?

539
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:18,501
I was a student here, and

540
00:38:19,393 --> 00:38:21,006
you gave me some advice once.

541
00:38:22,641 --> 00:38:23,676
Winchester

542
00:38:24,191 --> 00:38:25,302
Right. Yeah.

543
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,455
You, uh...

544
00:38:27,078 --> 00:38:30,140
- You wrote that horror story.
- Yeah. Yeah, I did.

545
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:34,227
Yeah, it's kind of all
been one long horror story.

546
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,181
- What do you mean?
- Nothing. Sorry.

547
00:38:38,872 --> 00:38:40,448
So, what was this advice?

548
00:38:40,573 --> 00:38:42,516
I might need to plagiarize
myself down the line.

549
00:38:42,864 --> 00:38:45,330
You told me that I didn't have
to go into the family business.

550
00:38:45,455 --> 00:38:47,394
You said I should
make my own choices.

551
00:38:48,214 --> 00:38:50,520
So you've managed to do
your own thing, then?

552
00:38:51,524 --> 00:38:53,497
Yeah, for a while, yeah.

553
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,417
And I think I went to
college because of you.

554
00:38:59,507 --> 00:39:00,859
But, you know,

555
00:39:01,935 --> 00:39:03,052
People grow up.

556
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,223
Responsibilities.

557
00:39:11,055 --> 00:39:12,551
But still, um...

558
00:39:13,402 --> 00:39:15,997
you took an interest in
me when no one else did.

559
00:39:17,276 --> 00:39:18,987
That matters, so...

560
00:39:20,032 --> 00:39:21,057
Thank you.

561
00:39:23,322 --> 00:39:26,683
Well, you know, the only thing that
really matters is that you're happy.

562
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:30,492
Are you happy, sam?
