1
00:00:01,083 --> 00:00:04,889
You chose a demon over your own brother
And look what happened.

2
00:00:05,014 --> 00:00:08,600
I did it. I started the
apocalypse, and i set lucifer free.

3
00:00:08,725 --> 00:00:10,050
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:12,522
I would give anything...

5
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:14,722
- To take it all back.
- I know you would.

6
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:18,943
If we're gonna be a team, you and i,
It has to be a two-way street.

7
00:00:19,068 --> 00:00:21,288
We got to just grab on to
whatever's in front of us,

8
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:23,104
Kick its ass, and go down fighting.

9
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,940
I can get on board with that.

10
00:01:29,446 --> 00:01:31,157
I told you to go to bed.

11
00:01:31,282 --> 00:01:33,821
I can't. I'm dead.

12
00:01:33,946 --> 00:01:35,720
What is this... ketchup?

13
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,412
Gross!

14
00:01:38,445 --> 00:01:39,524
You're mean.

15
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:42,159
That's what your parents
pay me for, to be mean.

16
00:01:42,284 --> 00:01:43,980
Bed, now!

17
00:01:44,286 --> 00:01:46,229
Just wait. Wait.

18
00:01:46,687 --> 00:01:49,724
I'll go to bed if you
let me touch your boob.

19
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:50,949
Go!

20
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:43,821
I'll, take amber home.

21
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:45,313
Don't wait up.

22
00:03:17,105 --> 00:03:19,704
Supernatural 306

23
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,595
Agents page and plant, fbi.

24
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,916
Gentlemen. What brings you by?

25
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,120
We need to see amber greer's body.

26
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:32,753
Really? What for?

27
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:36,996
The police report said something
clawed through her skull?

28
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,535
You didn't read the autopsy report

29
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:41,443
That i e-mailed out this morning?

30
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:43,736
We had, server issues.

31
00:03:57,584 --> 00:03:59,227
When they brought her in,

32
00:03:59,352 --> 00:04:01,764
We thought she was attacked
by a wolf or something.

33
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:02,932
Or something.

34
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:05,191
But we were wrong.

35
00:04:07,394 --> 00:04:09,730
- Is that a...
- It's a press-on nail.

36
00:04:10,164 --> 00:04:13,544
- We found it in her temporal lobe.
- Is that even possible?

37
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,713
Wait, are you saying that
she did this to herself?

38
00:04:16,412 --> 00:04:18,007
She scratched her brains out.

39
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,307
It'd take hours, and
it'd hurt like hell,

40
00:04:22,084 --> 00:04:23,971
- But sure, it's possible.
- How?

41
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,822
Pick your acronym, ocd, pcp.

42
00:04:26,947 --> 00:04:28,517
It all spells "crazy."

43
00:04:28,816 --> 00:04:31,604
My guess...
some kind of phantom itch.

44
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:34,555
An extreme case, but...

45
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,407
- Phantom itch?
- Yeah.

46
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,104
All it takes is someone
talking about an itch...

47
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:43,897
or thinking about one, even...

48
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:45,676
And suddenly you
can't stop scratching.

49
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:46,901
Thanks, doc.

50
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:55,125
Okay, now, some of these
questions might seem a bit odd,

51
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,083
But please just bear with me.

52
00:04:58,245 --> 00:05:00,412
Have you noticed any
cold spots in the house?

53
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:05,329
- Okay, what about strange smells?
- Smells?

54
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,403
Whatcha lookin' for?

55
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:11,958
Don't know yet.

56
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:16,896
It's... jimmy, right?

57
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:21,027
So, amber was your babysitter?

58
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:22,655
Yes, sir.

59
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,460
Yeah, most of my babysitters sucked.

60
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:27,116
Especially ms. Chancey.

61
00:05:27,241 --> 00:05:29,081
She only cared about two things...

62
00:05:29,206 --> 00:05:31,209
"dynasty" and bedtime.

63
00:05:34,624 --> 00:05:36,752
Did you, you see anything
strange that night?

64
00:05:36,984 --> 00:05:38,021
No, sir.

65
00:05:40,145 --> 00:05:41,387
You sure about that?

66
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:44,336
I would tell you if
i knew something.

67
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,386
I promise... 100%.

68
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:47,660
Cross my heart.

69
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:55,632
- I happen to know you're lying.
- I'm not.

70
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,432
We gonna start talking truth,

71
00:06:05,557 --> 00:06:09,107
Or are you and me gonna have
to take a little trip downtown?

72
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:12,961
Kid said he put this on
the babysitter's hairbrush.

73
00:06:13,086 --> 00:06:14,814
There's no way itching powder

74
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:16,602
Made that girl scratch
her brains out.

75
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:18,144
It's just ground-up maple seeds.

76
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:20,808
If you have any other
theories, i'm open to 'em.

77
00:06:26,312 --> 00:06:27,896
Yeah, we'll be right there.

78
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:36,308
Dr. Morris, please dial 1-1.

79
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:37,820
What happened?

80
00:06:37,945 --> 00:06:40,197
- Guy got electrocuted.
- Any idea how?

81
00:06:40,322 --> 00:06:41,656
Maybe a loose wire

82
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:44,090
Or a piece of equipment shorted out.

83
00:06:44,215 --> 00:06:46,862
- So far, we haven't found anything.
- Witnesses?

84
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:48,948
Yeah, guy in there... mr. Stanley.

85
00:06:49,227 --> 00:06:50,533
He says he saw it, But

86
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:53,454
he's not making a lick of sense.
Senile.

87
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:54,894
Thanks.

88
00:07:00,722 --> 00:07:01,722
Mr. Stanley?

89
00:07:01,847 --> 00:07:03,169
It was just a joke.

90
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:07,009
I didn't know it would really work.

91
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:08,586
What would work?

92
00:07:10,753 --> 00:07:12,123
All i did...

93
00:07:13,403 --> 00:07:14,947
Was shake his hand.

94
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:33,978
- You ready?
- Hit it, mr. Wizard.

95
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,222
That'll do, pig.

96
00:07:56,523 --> 00:07:57,861
What the hell?

97
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:01,369
That crap isn't supposed to work.

98
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:03,301
This thing doesn't
even have batteries.

99
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,069
So, what?
Are we looking at cursed objects?

100
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:08,653
Sounds good.

101
00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:12,509
Maybe there's
a powerful witch in town.

102
00:08:18,383 --> 00:08:19,788
Is there any link between the,

103
00:08:19,913 --> 00:08:22,361
The joy buzzer
and the itching powder?

104
00:08:23,624 --> 00:08:25,627
One was made in china,
the other mexico,

105
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:27,840
But they were both bought
from the same store.

106
00:08:57,505 --> 00:08:59,554
Welcome to the conjurarium,

107
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,820
Sanctum of magic and mystery.

108
00:09:02,695 --> 00:09:03,732
You the owner?

109
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:04,857
Yep.

110
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:08,193
You sold any itching powder
or joy buzzers lately?

111
00:09:08,587 --> 00:09:10,132
Yeah, a grand total of one of each.

112
00:09:10,489 --> 00:09:12,551
They aren't exactly
big-ticket items.

113
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:16,313
You boys here to buy something
or... what?

114
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:19,684
So, you get many customers?

115
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:21,767
Kids come in.

116
00:09:21,892 --> 00:09:25,070
They don't buy much, But they're
more than happy to break stuff.

117
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:28,022
These days, all they care
about are their iphones

118
00:09:28,147 --> 00:09:30,057
And those kissing-vampire movies.

119
00:09:30,182 --> 00:09:31,768
The whole thing makes me just...

120
00:09:31,893 --> 00:09:33,152
Angry?

121
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:36,798
Yeah. Yeah, i am angry.

122
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:39,970
This shop has been
my life for 20 years,

123
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,704
And now it's wasting
away to nothing.

124
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:44,329
- Which is why you hate them.
- I suppose.

125
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,608
You wish there was something
you could do about it.

126
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:47,942
Yeah, i guess i do.

127
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:49,462
So you're taking revenge...

128
00:09:51,738 --> 00:09:53,013
... with this.

129
00:10:03,357 --> 00:10:05,854
Something tells me this
guy is not a powerful witch.

130
00:10:06,297 --> 00:10:07,349
Sorry.

131
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:08,474
Sorry.

132
00:10:15,176 --> 00:10:16,993
I'll just slip this
tooth under your pillow,

133
00:10:17,118 --> 00:10:18,775
And while you're asleep,

134
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,644
The tooth fairy will float down

135
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:22,412
And swap it out for a quarter.

136
00:10:22,537 --> 00:10:24,854
So some freak is gonna come
in my room

137
00:10:24,979 --> 00:10:27,459
while i'm sleeping
And take my tooth?

138
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:29,884
Sounds scary.

139
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:31,411
No, thank you.

140
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:33,449
Come on.

141
00:10:44,475 --> 00:10:45,975
Good night, sweetie.

142
00:11:36,948 --> 00:11:38,012
Hold still.

143
00:11:38,312 --> 00:11:40,407
You might feel just a little...

144
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:41,742
Pinch.

145
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:56,005
I appreciate that, Nurse...

146
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,583
- fremont.
- Please... call me "jen."

147
00:11:59,011 --> 00:11:59,977
"Jen" it is.

148
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,218
What's up with toothless?

149
00:12:06,694 --> 00:12:08,696
- Cavity creeps get ahold of him?
- Yeah. Close.

150
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:10,348
He wrote up a description...

151
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,133
5'10", 350 pounds,

152
00:12:13,705 --> 00:12:15,226
Wings, and a pink tutu.

153
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:17,258
Said it was the tooth fairy.

154
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:19,202
So he's obviously whacked
out on painkillers.

155
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,192
Maybe.

156
00:12:20,317 --> 00:12:22,533
Whatever it was got past
locked doors and windows

157
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:24,511
Without triggering the alarm.

158
00:12:24,636 --> 00:12:26,179
Come on. The tooth fairy?

159
00:12:26,304 --> 00:12:29,073
And it left 32 quarters
underneath his pillow...

160
00:12:29,663 --> 00:12:31,113
One for each tooth.

161
00:12:32,277 --> 00:12:34,693
I will see your crazy
and raise you some.

162
00:12:34,818 --> 00:12:37,023
There's a couple of kids
upstairs with stomach ulcers...

163
00:12:37,148 --> 00:12:39,091
Say they got it from
mixing pop rocks and coke.

164
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,626
Another guy...

165
00:12:41,164 --> 00:12:42,803
His face froze that way.

166
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:45,363
What way?

167
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:55,649
He held it too
long, and... it stuck.

168
00:12:56,005 --> 00:12:57,567
They're flying in a plastic surgeon.

169
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:01,073
If you add all that up...

170
00:13:04,548 --> 00:13:05,548
I got nothing.

171
00:13:07,968 --> 00:13:09,814
I thought sea-monkeys were real.

172
00:13:10,287 --> 00:13:11,949
They are. They're brine shrimp.

173
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:13,394
No, i mean like in the ads.

174
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,163
Like the sea-monkey
wife cooks the pot roast

175
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:17,765
For the sea-monkey husband,

176
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,933
And the sea-monkey
kids play with the dog

177
00:13:20,058 --> 00:13:22,104
In a sea-monkey castle... real.

178
00:13:22,229 --> 00:13:23,634
I was 6, but i believed it.

179
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,770
Point is...

180
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:28,268
Maybe that's the connection.

181
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,877
The tooth fairy,
the pop rocks and coke,

182
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:32,579
The joy buzzer that shocks you...

183
00:13:32,704 --> 00:13:34,311
They're all lies that kids believe.

184
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,897
And now they're coming true.

185
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:39,091
Okay, so whatever's doing
this is reshaping reality.

186
00:13:39,642 --> 00:13:41,574
It has the powers of a god. Or...

187
00:13:42,616 --> 00:13:43,572
of a trickster.

188
00:13:44,264 --> 00:13:47,114
Yeah, with the sense of
humor of a 9-year-old.

189
00:13:48,017 --> 00:13:48,827
Or you.

190
00:13:57,615 --> 00:13:59,802
Dude, seriously...
still with the ham?

191
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,359
We don't have a fridge.

192
00:14:03,935 --> 00:14:05,335
I found something.

193
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:06,579
Here.

194
00:14:07,276 --> 00:14:09,206
Tooth fairy attack was here,

195
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:11,236
Pop rocks and coke was here,
Then you've got

196
00:14:11,361 --> 00:14:13,434
itching powder,
face freeze, and joy buzzer...

197
00:14:13,612 --> 00:14:15,616
All located within a 2-mile radius.

198
00:14:15,741 --> 00:14:17,312
We got a blast zone of weird,

199
00:14:17,437 --> 00:14:19,737
And inside, fantasy becomes reality.

200
00:14:20,087 --> 00:14:21,087
Looks like.

201
00:14:21,273 --> 00:14:23,427
And what's the a-bomb at its center?

202
00:14:23,552 --> 00:14:26,209
Four acres of farmland...
and a house.

203
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,243
Our motel isn't in that
circle, by any chance?

204
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:33,488
Yeah.

205
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,012
Why?

206
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:41,339
Dude...

207
00:14:42,857 --> 00:14:44,551
That's not what i think it is,
is it?

208
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,591
I got bored. That nurse was hot.

209
00:14:48,368 --> 00:14:50,513
You know you can go
blind from that, too.

210
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:54,849
Give me five minutes. We'll
go check out that house.

211
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:58,001
Do not use my razor!

212
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:36,869
Can i help you?

213
00:15:38,263 --> 00:15:39,430
What's your name?

214
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,054
Who wants to know?

215
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:44,001
The...

216
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:47,032
... fbi.

217
00:15:48,225 --> 00:15:49,257
Let me see that.

218
00:15:51,878 --> 00:15:53,409
What, you guys don't knock?

219
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,080
- Are your parents home?
- They work.

220
00:15:57,205 --> 00:15:59,189
You mind if we ask
you a few questions,

221
00:15:59,314 --> 00:16:01,092
Maybe take a look around the house?

222
00:16:01,773 --> 00:16:02,923
I don't know.

223
00:16:03,794 --> 00:16:05,245
Come on. You can trust us.

224
00:16:05,568 --> 00:16:06,798
We're the authorities.

225
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,579
What's that?

226
00:16:19,704 --> 00:16:20,913
It's called soup.

227
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:22,425
You heat it up, and you eat it.

228
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,125
Right. I know. It's just...

229
00:16:29,873 --> 00:16:31,358
I used to make my own dinner, too,

230
00:16:31,483 --> 00:16:33,241
- when i was a kid.
- I'm not a kid.

231
00:16:35,277 --> 00:16:36,853
Right. No, i know.

232
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,062
I'm robert, by the way.

233
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,330
Jesse, nice to meet you.

234
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:45,396
Did you draw this?

235
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:47,071
It's the tooth fairy.

236
00:16:48,536 --> 00:16:50,544
That's what you think the
tooth fairy looks like?

237
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:52,151
Yeah. My dad told me about him.

238
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:57,427
What, didn't your dad tell
you about the tooth fairy?

239
00:16:58,314 --> 00:16:59,314
My dad?

240
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:02,933
My dad told me different stories.

241
00:17:03,434 --> 00:17:05,106
The tooth fairy isn't a story.

242
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,079
What do you know about
itching powder, jesse?

243
00:17:10,204 --> 00:17:12,133
That stuff will make you
scratch your brains out.

244
00:17:13,377 --> 00:17:14,720
Pop rocks and coke?

245
00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:16,890
You mix them, and you'll
end up in the hospital.

246
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:18,515
Everyone knows that.

247
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:23,917
- You shouldn't have that.
- Why not?

248
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:25,835
It can electrocute you.

249
00:17:27,739 --> 00:17:29,088
Actually, it can't.

250
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:31,216
It's just a wind-up toy.

251
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,135
It's totally harmless.

252
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,593
Doesn't even have batteries.

253
00:17:34,718 --> 00:17:36,151
So, it can't shock you?

254
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:37,547
Nope. Not at all.

255
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:39,298
I swear.

256
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:46,687
All it does is
just shake in your hand.

257
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:48,212
It's kind of lame.

258
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:49,703
See?

259
00:17:54,268 --> 00:17:56,658
What did you say
your name was, again?

260
00:18:03,036 --> 00:18:04,728
Dude, what the hell?

261
00:18:04,853 --> 00:18:06,287
I had a hunch. I went with it.

262
00:18:06,412 --> 00:18:08,343
- You risked my ass on a hunch?!
- You're fine.

263
00:18:08,468 --> 00:18:11,046
We know who's turning this
town into willy wonka's worst nightmare.

264
00:18:11,171 --> 00:18:12,224
The kid.

265
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:13,985
Everything jesse
believes comes true.

266
00:18:14,435 --> 00:18:16,458
He thinks the tooth
fairy looks like belushi,

267
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,978
Joy buzzers really shock people.
Boom. That's what happens.

268
00:18:19,103 --> 00:18:21,272
But convince him the joy
buzzers don't actually work,

269
00:18:21,397 --> 00:18:23,594
And they go from killing
machines back into crap toys.

270
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:25,520
He probably doesn't
even know he's doing it.

271
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:31,338
How is he doing it?

272
00:18:41,974 --> 00:18:43,638
Dug up what i could on jesse turner.

273
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:44,820
It's not much.

274
00:18:44,945 --> 00:18:47,692
"B" student, won last
year's pinewood derby.

275
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,402
But get this.

276
00:18:49,979 --> 00:18:51,349
Jesse was adopted.

277
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,594
His birth records are sealed.

278
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:56,290
- So you unsealed them, and...?
- There's no father listed,

279
00:18:56,415 --> 00:18:58,969
But jesse's biological
mom is named julia wright.

280
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:01,994
She lives in elk creek, on
the other side of the state.

281
00:19:28,221 --> 00:19:30,356
Whatever you're
selling, i'm not interested.

282
00:19:30,481 --> 00:19:32,007
We're not salesmen.

283
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:34,172
Agents page and plant, fbi.

284
00:19:39,566 --> 00:19:40,843
Put your badge in the slot.

285
00:19:40,968 --> 00:19:43,035
Your partner's, too.

286
00:19:57,417 --> 00:19:58,426
What do you want?

287
00:19:58,551 --> 00:19:59,551
Thank you.

288
00:20:00,892 --> 00:20:02,892
We just had a few questions...

289
00:20:03,378 --> 00:20:04,628
About your son.

290
00:20:05,435 --> 00:20:06,885
I don't have a son.

291
00:20:08,935 --> 00:20:11,335
He was born march 29, 1998,
in Omaha.

292
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,511
You put him up for adoption?

293
00:20:16,225 --> 00:20:17,475
What about him?

294
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:20,311
We were just wondering...

295
00:20:20,563 --> 00:20:21,613
Was it a...

296
00:20:23,498 --> 00:20:25,056
Was it a normal pregnancy?

297
00:20:26,587 --> 00:20:28,101
Was there anything strange?

298
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,603
- Stay away from me!
- Mrs. Wright, wait!

299
00:20:36,008 --> 00:20:37,558
We just want to talk!

300
00:20:42,768 --> 00:20:44,168
You're not demons?

301
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,452
How do you know about demons?

302
00:20:52,596 --> 00:20:53,896
I was possessed.

303
00:20:55,598 --> 00:20:58,698
A demon took control of my body,
and I hurt people.

304
00:21:00,704 --> 00:21:02,004
I killed people.

305
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:04,012
That wasn't you.

306
00:21:04,526 --> 00:21:05,826
But I was there.

307
00:21:06,847 --> 00:21:08,847
I heard a woman beg for mercy.

308
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,513
I felt a young girl's blood
drip down my hands.

309
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:16,005
That's how you knew about the salt.

310
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:18,845
I picked up tricks.
It was in my head for months.

311
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:21,304
- How many months?
- Nine.

312
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:26,809
So your son...

313
00:21:27,665 --> 00:21:28,915
The whole time.

314
00:21:29,217 --> 00:21:30,867
The pregnancy, birth...

315
00:21:32,282 --> 00:21:33,282
All of it.

316
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:36,669
I was possessed.

317
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:40,744
The night the baby was born,

318
00:21:40,891 --> 00:21:41,991
I was alone.

319
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,735
And the pain was...

320
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,360
It was overwhelming.

321
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,805
I screamed.

322
00:21:48,328 --> 00:21:49,772
And it came out a laugh...

323
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,875
Because the demon was happy.

324
00:21:54,657 --> 00:21:55,907
It used my body

325
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,274
to give birth to a child.

326
00:22:04,505 --> 00:22:07,450
When it was over, something changed.
Maybe the demon was tired

327
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,218
or if the pain helped me fight it,
but...

328
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,999
Somehow, I took control.

329
00:22:16,413 --> 00:22:18,463
And the demon
wailed inside me.

330
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,149
It pounded against my skull.

331
00:22:20,274 --> 00:22:22,574
I thought my head was gonna explode.

332
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,091
But...

333
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:26,141
I knew.

334
00:22:27,748 --> 00:22:29,305
I knew what I had to do.

335
00:22:41,456 --> 00:22:43,856
And when I was alone
with the baby...

336
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,150
Part of me...

337
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,857
Part of me wanted to kill it.

338
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,657
But, God help me,
I couldn't do that.

339
00:22:55,782 --> 00:22:56,782
So...

340
00:22:57,775 --> 00:22:59,525
I put it up for adoption.

341
00:23:00,499 --> 00:23:01,499
And I ran.

342
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:04,799
Who was the father?

343
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:08,677
I was a virgin.

344
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,608
Have you seen my son?

345
00:23:15,934 --> 00:23:17,034
Is he human?

346
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:20,615
His name's Jesse.

347
00:23:21,765 --> 00:23:23,583
He lives in Alliance.

348
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:26,904
He's a good kid.

349
00:23:31,806 --> 00:23:32,956
So, now what?

350
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:34,528
We need help.

351
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,009
- I take it you got our message.
- It's lucky you found the boy.

352
00:23:49,222 --> 00:23:50,272
Real lucky.

353
00:23:50,946 --> 00:23:52,597
- What do we do with him?
- Kill him.

354
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:01,917
This child is half demon and half human,
but it's far more powerful than either.

355
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,777
Other cultures call this hybrid,
cambion or katako.

356
00:24:07,218 --> 00:24:09,155
You know him as the Antichrist.

357
00:24:21,015 --> 00:24:22,265
That wasn't me.

358
00:24:24,746 --> 00:24:26,196
Who put that there?

359
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,080
Anyway, I don't get it.

360
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:29,759
Jesse is the devil's son?

361
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,761
No, of course not.

362
00:24:32,616 --> 00:24:34,930
Your bible gets more wrong
than it does right.

363
00:24:35,055 --> 00:24:37,033
The Antichrist
is not Lucifer's child.

364
00:24:37,158 --> 00:24:38,518
It's just demon spawn.

365
00:24:39,275 --> 00:24:41,675
But it is one of the devil's
greatest weapons

366
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,147
in the war against heaven.

367
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,150
If Jesse's a demonic howitzer,
what's he doing in Nebraska?

368
00:24:46,543 --> 00:24:47,961
The demons lost him.

369
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:50,071
They can't find him.
But they're looking.

370
00:24:50,196 --> 00:24:51,417
They lost him because...

371
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:52,860
Because of his power.

372
00:24:52,985 --> 00:24:55,201
It hides him from both
angels and demons.

373
00:24:56,197 --> 00:24:57,197
For now.

374
00:24:57,442 --> 00:24:59,622
So he's got, like,
a force field around him.

375
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,374
Well, that's great.
Problem solved.

376
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,919
With Lucifer risen,
this child grows strong.

377
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:08,687
Soon, he will do more
than just make a few toys come to life.

378
00:25:09,228 --> 00:25:11,551
Something
that will draw the demons to him.

379
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,277
The demons will find this child.

380
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,210
Lucifer will twist this boy
to his purpose.

381
00:25:18,335 --> 00:25:19,824
And then, with a word,

382
00:25:19,949 --> 00:25:21,179
this child

383
00:25:22,028 --> 00:25:24,128
will destroy the host of heaven.

384
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,040
Wait, you're saying that...

385
00:25:27,361 --> 00:25:29,193
Jesse's gonna nuke the angels?

386
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,411
We cannot allow that to happen.

387
00:25:35,813 --> 00:25:36,813
Wait.

388
00:25:38,857 --> 00:25:40,705
We're the good guys.
We don't just...

389
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,073
Kill children.

390
00:25:44,441 --> 00:25:45,491
A year ago,

391
00:25:46,217 --> 00:25:49,714
you would have done
whatever it took to win this war.

392
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,082
Things change.

393
00:25:56,249 --> 00:25:59,045
Look, we are not going to kill him.
All right?

394
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,017
But we can't leave Jesse here either.

395
00:26:01,322 --> 00:26:02,822
We know that.
So...

396
00:26:03,883 --> 00:26:06,230
We take him to Bobby's.
He'll know what to do.

397
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,798
You'll kidnap him?

398
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:10,526
What is going on in this town,

399
00:26:10,651 --> 00:26:12,673
it's what happens
when this thing is happy.

400
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:15,740
You cannot imagine
what it will do if it's angry.

401
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:19,201
Besides, how will you hold him?

402
00:26:19,326 --> 00:26:21,537
With a thought,
he could be halfway around the world.

403
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:25,494
- So we...
- So we tell him the truth.

404
00:26:26,071 --> 00:26:28,195
You say he's destined to go dark side.
Fine.

405
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,720
But he hasn't yet.

406
00:26:29,845 --> 00:26:31,380
So if we lay it all out for him,

407
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,048
what he is, the apocalypse,
everything!

408
00:26:34,491 --> 00:26:36,427
He might make the right choice.

409
00:26:43,557 --> 00:26:44,607
You didn't.

410
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,487
And I can't take that chance.

411
00:26:58,225 --> 00:26:59,225
Damn it.

412
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,321
Sorry. I'm sorry.

413
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,014
It's no worries. You okay?

414
00:27:17,561 --> 00:27:19,461
It's just today, a little...

415
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:20,888
Shaky.

416
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,795
Talking to the Winchesters
will do that to you.

417
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:27,087
Don't you recognize me, sweetheart?

418
00:27:28,236 --> 00:27:30,815
We had some great times together,
didn't we?

419
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,033
And then you stole something from us.
Hid it away.

420
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,450
That was very, very naughty of you.

421
00:27:38,401 --> 00:27:40,351
So we watched, and we waited.

422
00:27:40,821 --> 00:27:41,821
And now...

423
00:27:42,184 --> 00:27:44,620
They told you where he is,
didn't they?

424
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,438
I think it's time
we go and visit our son.

425
00:28:26,196 --> 00:28:27,496
Don't be afraid.

426
00:28:28,522 --> 00:28:29,582
I won't hurt you.

427
00:28:40,074 --> 00:28:41,484
Mom! Dad!

428
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:43,909
Your mother and father are sleeping.

429
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,723
They won't wake until morning.

430
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,060
I'm sorry.

431
00:29:03,985 --> 00:29:05,535
Was there a guy here?

432
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,888
In a trench coat?

433
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,310


434
00:29:36,786 --> 00:29:38,236
Was he your friend?

435
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:39,708
Him?

436
00:29:44,425 --> 00:29:45,475
I did that.

437
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,494
But how?

438
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,832
You're a superhero.

439
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:54,723
I am?

440
00:29:56,703 --> 00:29:59,203
Who else could turn someone
into a toy?

441
00:29:59,943 --> 00:30:01,048
You're Superman.

442
00:30:01,305 --> 00:30:03,719
Minus the cape and the go-go boots.

443
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:09,306
See, my partner and I,

444
00:30:10,034 --> 00:30:12,534
we work for a secret government agency.

445
00:30:12,955 --> 00:30:15,771
It's our job to find kids
with special powers.

446
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:17,773
We're here to take you

447
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,091
to a hidden base in South Dakota.

448
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,112
Where you'll be trained
to fight evil.

449
00:30:23,504 --> 00:30:26,204
- Like the X-Men?
- Exactly like the X-Men.

450
00:30:27,836 --> 00:30:30,791
In fact, the guy we're taking you to,
he's even in a wheelchair.

451
00:30:31,646 --> 00:30:32,996
You'll be a hero.

452
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,458
You'll save lives,
you'll get the girl.

453
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:36,959
Sounds like fun, right?

454
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,673
They're lying to you.

455
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,095
Stay right there, dreamboat.

456
00:30:48,618 --> 00:30:49,868
Can't hurt you.

457
00:30:50,386 --> 00:30:51,432
Orders.

458
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,892
You, on the other hand?

459
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,602
Hurting you's encouraged.

460
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:02,193
Leave him alone!

461
00:31:05,928 --> 00:31:07,278
You're beautiful.

462
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,701
You have your father's eyes.

463
00:31:11,726 --> 00:31:13,926
- Who are you?
- I'm your mother.

464
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:15,957
No, you're not.

465
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,833
You're half human...

466
00:31:19,424 --> 00:31:20,669
Half one of us.

467
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:22,323
She means demons, Jesse!

468
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:30,221
Those people you call your parents,

469
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,537
they lied to you, too.
You're not theirs.

470
00:31:32,662 --> 00:31:33,712
Not really.

471
00:31:35,205 --> 00:31:37,269
- My mom and dad love me.
- Do they?

472
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,422
Is that why
they leave you alone all day?

473
00:31:39,547 --> 00:31:41,148
Because they love you so much?

474
00:31:41,804 --> 00:31:43,067
These people...

475
00:31:43,358 --> 00:31:47,034
These impostors, they told you
that the tooth fairy was real

476
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,241
and that your toys could hurt you
and other things that aren't true.

477
00:31:50,448 --> 00:31:53,494
They love you so much
they made your whole life a lie.

478
00:31:55,878 --> 00:31:57,778
Look into your heart, Jesse.

479
00:31:58,315 --> 00:32:01,812
You've always known you weren't theirs,
you've always known you were different.

480
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,510
Everyone has lied to you.

481
00:32:05,218 --> 00:32:06,549
They're not FBI agents.

482
00:32:09,713 --> 00:32:11,428
And you're not a superhero.

483
00:32:12,815 --> 00:32:14,879
- Then what am I?
- You're powerful.

484
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:18,821
You can have anything you want.
You can do anything you want.

485
00:32:18,946 --> 00:32:20,521
Don't listen to her, Jesse!

486
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,566
They treated you like a child.
Nobody trusted you.

487
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:24,942
Everybody's lied to you.

488
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,010
Doesn't that make you angry?

489
00:32:38,995 --> 00:32:41,168
See? It does make you angry.

490
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:45,394
But I'm telling you the truth,
Jesse.

491
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,548
Wouldn't it be better
if there were no lies?

492
00:32:48,604 --> 00:32:49,854
Come with me...

493
00:32:50,347 --> 00:32:52,553
And you can wash it all clean.

494
00:32:53,122 --> 00:32:54,270
Start over.

495
00:32:54,395 --> 00:32:55,545
Imagine that.

496
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,330
A world without lies.

497
00:33:03,069 --> 00:33:04,732
She's right, we lied to you.

498
00:33:05,726 --> 00:33:07,284
But I'll tell you the truth.

499
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,480
I just want...

500
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:12,961
To tell...

501
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:14,784
Stop it.

502
00:33:16,218 --> 00:33:18,318
I wanna hear what he has to say.

503
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:21,455
You're stronger than I thought.

504
00:33:24,788 --> 00:33:26,038
We lied to you.

505
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:27,759
And I'm sorry.

506
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,140
So here's the truth.

507
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,542
I'm Sam Winchester.

508
00:33:33,232 --> 00:33:34,932
That's my brother, Dean.

509
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:37,264
We hunt monsters.

510
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,391
Except when you are the monster.

511
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,227
- Right, Sammy?
- And that woman right there is Julia.

512
00:33:44,053 --> 00:33:45,272
She's your mother.

513
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,216
But the thing inside of her,

514
00:33:48,341 --> 00:33:49,835
that you're talking to,

515
00:33:50,971 --> 00:33:52,625
- it's a demon.
- A demon?

516
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,823
He's done nothing but lying
since you've met him.

517
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,491
Don't listen to him.

518
00:33:56,989 --> 00:33:58,911
- Punish him.
- Sit down and shut up.

519
00:34:05,389 --> 00:34:06,389
There's...

520
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,103
Kind of a...

521
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:10,839
A war between angels and demons,

522
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,007
and...

523
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,176
You're a part of it.

524
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:16,053
I'm just a kid.

525
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:18,907
You can go with her if you want.

526
00:34:19,273 --> 00:34:20,974
I can't stop you, no one can.

527
00:34:21,624 --> 00:34:22,924
But if you do...

528
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:25,646
Millions of people will die.

529
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:28,232
She said I was half demon.
Is that true?

530
00:34:30,297 --> 00:34:32,147
But you're half human, too.

531
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:34,383
You can do the right thing.

532
00:34:34,508 --> 00:34:36,308
You've got choices, Jesse.

533
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:38,200
But if you make the wrong ones,

534
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,577
it'll haunt you
for the rest of your life.

535
00:34:41,757 --> 00:34:43,278
Why are you telling me this?

536
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:46,212
I have to believe
someone can make the right choice.

537
00:34:47,691 --> 00:34:49,141
Even if I couldn't.

538
00:34:57,844 --> 00:34:58,971
Get out of her.

539
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,790
How did you do that?

540
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,320
I just did.

541
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:20,031
Kid...

542
00:35:21,465 --> 00:35:22,715
You're awesome.

543
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,667


544
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,327
Is she gonna be all right?

545
00:35:35,892 --> 00:35:36,942
Eventually.

546
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,682
Look, truth is,

547
00:35:51,194 --> 00:35:53,144
he's kind of a buddy of mine.

548
00:35:53,747 --> 00:35:56,747
- Could you turn him back?
- He tried to kill me.

549
00:35:58,901 --> 00:35:59,901
Right.

550
00:36:00,775 --> 00:36:02,159
But he's a good guy.

551
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,535
He was just confused.

552
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:11,919
It's been a long night.
We'll talk about it later.

553
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,590
What now?

554
00:36:21,025 --> 00:36:22,929
Now we take you some place safe.

555
00:36:23,463 --> 00:36:24,913
Get you trained up.

556
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:27,154
You'd be handy in a fight, kid.

557
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,228
What if I don't wanna fight?

558
00:36:38,141 --> 00:36:39,441
You're powerful.

559
00:36:40,345 --> 00:36:41,895
More powerful than...

560
00:36:43,415 --> 00:36:45,815
Pretty much
anything we've ever seen.

561
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:47,871
- That makes you...
- A freak.

562
00:36:52,531 --> 00:36:54,086
To some people, maybe.

563
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:55,429
But not to us.

564
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,298
We're kind of freaks ourselves.

565
00:37:01,061 --> 00:37:02,511
I can't stay here, can I?

566
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,305
The demons know where you are,
more will come.

567
00:37:11,567 --> 00:37:13,507
I won't go without my mom and dad.

568
00:37:15,121 --> 00:37:17,262
There's nothing more important
than family.

569
00:37:17,587 --> 00:37:18,687
We get that.

570
00:37:19,714 --> 00:37:22,544
And if you want to take them with you,
we'll back your play.

571
00:37:23,269 --> 00:37:24,904
But you got to understand...

572
00:37:25,029 --> 00:37:27,077
It's gonna be dangerous
for them, too.

573
00:37:27,751 --> 00:37:29,901
- What do you mean?
- Our dad...

574
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:32,708
He would take us with him
wherever he went.

575
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:34,126
Where is he now?

576
00:37:34,477 --> 00:37:35,477
Dead.

577
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,850
A demon killed him.

578
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:40,419
Look, Jesse...

579
00:37:41,598 --> 00:37:43,176
Once you're in this fight,

580
00:37:45,803 --> 00:37:47,402
you're in it till the end.

581
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:49,509
Win or lose.

582
00:37:51,455 --> 00:37:52,805
What should I do?

583
00:37:53,464 --> 00:37:55,814
We can't tell you.
It's your choice.

584
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:58,507
It's not fair, I know.

585
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:03,614
Can I go see my parents?

586
00:38:07,222 --> 00:38:08,822
I need to say goodbye.

587
00:38:12,592 --> 00:38:13,592
Sure.

588
00:39:18,516 --> 00:39:20,211
He's been up there a long time.

589
00:39:30,056 --> 00:39:31,076
He's gone.

590
00:39:32,842 --> 00:39:33,842
Where?

591
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:35,117
I don't know.

592
00:39:35,514 --> 00:39:37,457
Jesse put everyone in town
back to normal.

593
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:39,543
The ones still alive.

594
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,320
Then he vanished.

595
00:39:50,604 --> 00:39:51,954
What does it say?

596
00:39:57,168 --> 00:39:59,656
That he had to leave
to keep his parents safe.

597
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:02,399
That he loves them and he's sorry.

598
00:40:06,074 --> 00:40:08,363
- How do we find him?
- With the boy's powers,

599
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,531
we can't.

600
00:40:09,656 --> 00:40:11,324
Not unless he wants to be found.

601
00:40:17,638 --> 00:40:19,594
You think Jesse's gonna be okay?

602
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:22,253
I hope so.

603
00:40:26,468 --> 00:40:29,551
You know, we destroyed that kid's life
by telling him the truth.

604
00:40:31,955 --> 00:40:33,955
We didn't have a choice, Dean.

605
00:40:38,331 --> 00:40:41,396
You know, I'm starting to get why
parents lie to their kids.

606
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:45,496
You want them to believe
that the worst thing out there

607
00:40:45,621 --> 00:40:47,364
is mixing pop rocks and coke.

608
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,547
Protect them from the real evil.

609
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:53,459
You want them going to bed
feeling safe.

610
00:40:53,938 --> 00:40:55,946
If that means lying to them,
so be it.

611
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,760
The more I think about it,

612
00:41:03,968 --> 00:41:06,218
the more I wish dad had lied to us.

613
00:41:07,918 --> 00:41:09,068
Yeah, me too.
