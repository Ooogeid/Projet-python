1
00:00:02,796 --> 00:00:04,396
You think Adam's okay?

2
00:00:06,454 --> 00:00:07,454
Doubt it.

3
00:00:10,049 --> 00:00:11,093
Cass either.

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,227
The cage you sprung Lucifer from.
You can shove his ass back in.

5
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:22,836
Key to the cage.
Four rings from the horsemen.

6
00:00:22,961 --> 00:00:25,111
We got War's. We nicked Famine's.

7
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:28,027
That's two rings down.
Collect all four.

8
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:30,946
I can give you Pestilence.
Do you want the horsemen rings or not?

9
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,199
- What are we dealing with?
- Croatoan.

10
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,702
Virus of plague and pestilence.
More like demonic germ warfare.

11
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,471
They want our vaccine.

12
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,845
They need our vaccine.

13
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,708
It's called demand, people.
Now, supply!

14
00:00:44,057 --> 00:00:45,449
Sir, great news.

15
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,880
The vaccine trials...
the results have been...

16
00:00:48,552 --> 00:00:51,509
... really quite grotesque.
I think you'll be pleased.

17
00:00:54,185 --> 00:00:56,093
Hello, Death.

18
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:58,957
You make a wish.
I can give you anything you want, mate.

19
00:00:59,082 --> 00:01:01,766
Up to and including
Death's coordinates.

20
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:04,646
- All I need is...
- My soul.

21
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,233
Say we can open the cage.
But then what?

22
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:12,083
What if you guys lead the devil
to the edge and I jump in?

23
00:01:19,636 --> 00:01:21,586
Dr. Green, how was your trip?

24
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,849
Very productive.

25
00:01:26,765 --> 00:01:29,630
And how are we tonight, Celeste,
my favorite patient?

26
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,508
The nurse says you can't sleep.

27
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:35,466
I just feel worse and worse.

28
00:01:36,314 --> 00:01:40,224
That's because you're suffering
from a combination of the common cold...

29
00:01:40,777 --> 00:01:42,978
Dengue fever and a nasty,

30
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,813
nasty case of Japanese encephalitis.

31
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:48,078
What are you...

32
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,267
- I'm sorry. I...
- You heard me.

33
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:58,659
Oh, and look at that.

34
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:00,745
You never had chicken pox
as a child.

35
00:02:02,302 --> 00:02:04,798
This is gonna be fascinating.

36
00:02:04,923 --> 00:02:05,923
But I...

37
00:02:06,175 --> 00:02:07,632
How could I...

38
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:09,937
Have all those diseases at once?

39
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:12,423
Well, it's a proprietary blend.

40
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,341
I mix it up in a petri dish...

41
00:02:14,712 --> 00:02:17,343
The petri dish being... you.

42
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:22,433
Try and relax. It'll be all right.

43
00:02:22,745 --> 00:02:25,102
Are you gonna cure me?

44
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:28,271
No, you're going to die.

45
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:32,158
In four, three, two...

46
00:02:35,762 --> 00:02:36,862
Interesting.

47
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,233
= 521 =

48
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:43,496
= Supernatural Team =

49
00:02:47,952 --> 00:02:50,541
What is wrong with you?
Don't "Dean" me.

50
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,393
You have had
some stupid ideas in the past,

51
00:02:53,518 --> 00:02:55,559
but this... Did you know about this?

52
00:02:55,684 --> 00:02:57,414
- What?
- About Sam's genius plan

53
00:02:57,539 --> 00:02:59,239
to say yes to the devil.

54
00:03:03,213 --> 00:03:05,945
- Thanks for the heads up!
- This ain't about me.

55
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,937
- You can't do this.
- That's the consensus.

56
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:09,939
All right, awesome.
End of discussion.

57
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,570
This isn't over.

58
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,531
- Dean?
- Cass?

59
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:20,711
Is he okay?

60
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,078
We thought you were dead.
Where are you?

61
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,413
- A hospital.
- Are you okay?

62
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:31,418
You wanna elaborate?

63
00:03:31,904 --> 00:03:33,404
I just woke up here.

64
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:37,725
The doctors were fairly surprised.
They thought I was brain-dead.

65
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:40,253
So, a hospital?

66
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,715
Apparently, after Van Nuys,

67
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,721
I suddenly appeared,
bloody and unconscious,

68
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:48,978
on a shrimping boat off Delacroix.

69
00:03:50,203 --> 00:03:51,823
I'm told it upset the sailors.

70
00:03:52,823 --> 00:03:54,606
I gotta tell you.
You're just in time.

71
00:03:55,188 --> 00:03:57,152
We figured out a way
to pop Satan's box.

72
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,655
- How?
- It's a long story, but, look...

73
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:01,407
We're going after Pestilence now.

74
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,450
So if you want to zap over here...

75
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:06,621
- I can't "zap" anywhere.
- What do you mean?

76
00:04:07,837 --> 00:04:09,957
You could say
my batteries are drained.

77
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:11,834
 You're out of angel mojo?

78
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:14,879
I'm saying that I am thirsty
and my head aches.

79
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:18,076
I have a bug bite that itches
no matter how much I scratch it,

80
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:20,480
and I'm saying
that I'm just incredibly...

81
00:04:21,913 --> 00:04:22,913
Human.

82
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,079
Sorry.

83
00:04:28,204 --> 00:04:30,019
My point is I can't go anywhere

84
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,687
without money for...

85
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,814
An airplane ride.

86
00:04:34,362 --> 00:04:35,362
And food.

87
00:04:35,932 --> 00:04:38,132
And more pain medication, ideally.

88
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,713
No worries.
Bobby's here. He'll wire you the cash.

89
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,241
I will?

90
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,934
You said no to Michael.

91
00:04:47,648 --> 00:04:49,198
I owe you an apology.

92
00:04:49,943 --> 00:04:50,943
It's okay.

93
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:55,169
You are not the burnt and broken
shell of a man I believed you to be.

94
00:04:57,203 --> 00:04:58,203
Thank you.

95
00:05:00,614 --> 00:05:02,384
- I appreciate that.
- You're welcome.

96
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:10,935
Be careful.

97
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:22,338
So this is Dr. Evil's lair?

98
00:05:31,112 --> 00:05:32,804
It's more depressing than evil.

99
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:35,406
It's like a four-color brochure
for dying young.

100
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:38,325
Of course, to Pestilence,
it's probably Dollywood in there.

101
00:05:38,976 --> 00:05:39,976
Great.

102
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:43,092
A whole building full of people.
We don't know who's human,

103
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:45,511
who's demon, and who's Pestilence.

104
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:50,155
So what do we do?

105
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,101
Hang on.

106
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,448
I'm looking for my Nana.
Her name is Eunice Kennedy.

107
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:09,107
Go around front and see the nurse.

108
00:06:09,588 --> 00:06:11,231
You mind just helping me out, sir?

109
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:14,372
She's about that small

110
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,166
and gray hair, wears diapers.

111
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:26,427
Eunice Kennedy?

112
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:29,239
That's the beauty about improv.

113
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:31,948
You never know
what's gonna come out.

114
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,195
What are we looking for?

115
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,866
He's Pestilence,
so he probably looks sick.

116
00:06:49,194 --> 00:06:50,744
Everybody looks sick.

117
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,045
Now we're talking.

118
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,954
Dr. Green, how was your trip?

119
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:29,105
Very productive.

120
00:07:32,054 --> 00:07:34,912
And how are we tonight, Celeste,
my favorite patient?

121
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:01,606
Sir...

122
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,620
The Winchesters are here.

123
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:07,995
We should go.

124
00:08:13,164 --> 00:08:14,614
Are you kidding me?

125
00:08:15,322 --> 00:08:17,663
They have a track record
with horsemen.

126
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,114
You mean my brothers.

127
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,660
What they did to my brothers.

128
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:29,162
The only reasonable thing to do here
is to...

129
00:08:29,287 --> 00:08:31,426
Take it out
of their healthy young asses.

130
00:08:32,842 --> 00:08:35,556
We're under strict orders
not to kill the vessels.

131
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,809
If Satan wants them so bad,
he can glue them back together!

132
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,455
Come, come.

133
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,090
Now then.

134
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:13,093
- Page me if she's dying.
- Yes, doctor.

135
00:09:57,873 --> 00:09:59,223
Must be getting close.

136
00:10:00,006 --> 00:10:01,006
You think?

137
00:10:35,883 --> 00:10:37,783
The doctor will see you now.

138
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:48,476
Come right in.

139
00:10:49,325 --> 00:10:50,325


140
00:10:59,421 --> 00:11:01,076
You boys don't look well.

141
00:11:03,674 --> 00:11:05,674
It might be the Scarlet fever.

142
00:11:06,028 --> 00:11:08,163
Or the meningitis.

143
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:12,559
Or the syphilis.

144
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:18,176
That's no fun.

145
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:25,736
However you feel right now?

146
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:27,436
It's gonna get so very,

147
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:29,033
very much worse.

148
00:11:31,076 --> 00:11:32,076
Questions?

149
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:37,631
Disease gets a bad rap,
don't you think?

150
00:11:38,632 --> 00:11:41,306
For being filthy. Chaotic.

151
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:45,201
But, really, that just describes
people who get sick.

152
00:11:45,552 --> 00:11:46,902
Disease itself...

153
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,339
Very...

154
00:11:49,037 --> 00:11:50,037
Pure...

155
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,370
Single-minded.

156
00:11:52,854 --> 00:11:54,754
Bacteria have one purpose...

157
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:57,038
Divide and conquer.

158
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:02,054
That's why, in the end...

159
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,410
It always wins.

160
00:12:08,944 --> 00:12:12,468
So, you've got to wonder
why God pours all his love

161
00:12:12,593 --> 00:12:14,393
into something so messy...

162
00:12:15,781 --> 00:12:16,781
And weak.

163
00:12:19,627 --> 00:12:20,927
It's ridiculous.

164
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,848
All I can do is show him he's wrong,

165
00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:27,710
one epidemic

166
00:12:27,953 --> 00:12:28,953
at a time.

167
00:12:31,424 --> 00:12:34,169
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how's your pain?

168
00:12:38,664 --> 00:12:41,802
- How'd you get here?
- I took a bus. Don't worry, I...

169
00:12:48,838 --> 00:12:50,288
Well, look at that.

170
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,550
An occupied vessel, but...

171
00:12:54,031 --> 00:12:55,031
Powerless.

172
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,528
That's fascinating.

173
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:04,543
There's not a speck of angel in you,
is there?

174
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,238
Maybe just a speck.

175
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:21,216
It doesn't matter.

176
00:13:22,014 --> 00:13:23,214
It's too late.

177
00:13:35,631 --> 00:13:38,191
Well,
it's nice to actually score a home run

178
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,809
for once, ain't it?

179
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,575
- What?
- Last thing Pestilence said.

180
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,077
"It's too late."

181
00:13:50,545 --> 00:13:51,845
He get specific?

182
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,111
We're a little freaked out
he might have left a bomb somewhere.

183
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,009
So, please tell us
you have actual good news.

184
00:14:01,352 --> 00:14:03,425
Chicago
is about to be wiped off the map.

185
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,085
Storm of the millennium.

186
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,988
Sets off a Daisy chain
of natural disasters.

187
00:14:09,113 --> 00:14:11,363
Three million people are gonna die.

188
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,262
I don't understand
your definition of good news.

189
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
Well...

190
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:23,612
Death, the horseman,
he's gonna be there.

191
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:27,782
And if we can stop him
before he kick-starts this storm,

192
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,225
get his ring back...

193
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,330
- You make it sound so easy.
- I'm just trying to put a spin on it.

194
00:14:33,782 --> 00:14:34,782
Well...

195
00:14:36,884 --> 00:14:39,794
Bobby, how'd you put all this together,
anyways?

196
00:14:41,206 --> 00:14:43,213
I had, you know... Help.

197
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,012
Don't be so modest.

198
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,441
I barely helped at all.

199
00:14:55,974 --> 00:14:57,074
Hello, boys.

200
00:14:58,136 --> 00:14:59,397
Pleasure, et cetera.

201
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,551
Go ahead. Tell them.

202
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,198
There's no shame in it.

203
00:15:11,854 --> 00:15:13,004
Tell us what?

204
00:15:17,888 --> 00:15:19,288
World's gonna end.

205
00:15:20,288 --> 00:15:23,538
Seems stupid to get all precious
over one little soul.

206
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,165
You sold your soul?

207
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,802
- Pawned it. I intend to give it back.
- Then give it back!

208
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:30,277
- I will.
- Now!

209
00:15:30,402 --> 00:15:32,552
Did you kiss him? Just wondering!

210
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,365
Why'd you take a picture?

211
00:15:51,397 --> 00:15:53,095
Why do you have to use tongue?

212
00:15:57,935 --> 00:15:59,799
You know what? I'm sick of this.

213
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:02,043
Give him his soul back now.

214
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:05,213
- I'm sorry. I can't.
- Can't or won't?

215
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,382
I won't, all right? It's insurance.

216
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,833
- What are you talking about?
- You kill demons.

217
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,383
Gigantor over there

218
00:16:11,508 --> 00:16:13,408
has a temper issue about it.

219
00:16:14,178 --> 00:16:15,878
But you won't kill me...

220
00:16:16,155 --> 00:16:19,436
As long as I have that soul
in the deposit box.

221
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:21,521
You son of a bitch.

222
00:16:23,095 --> 00:16:24,107
I'll return it.

223
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,020
After all this is over,
and I can walk safely away.

224
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:30,296
Do we all understand each other?

225
00:16:49,932 --> 00:16:52,107
Let me guess.
We're about to have a talk.

226
00:17:00,611 --> 00:17:01,961
For the record...

227
00:17:02,843 --> 00:17:03,938
I agree with you.

228
00:17:05,048 --> 00:17:06,048
About me.

229
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:09,739
You think I'm too weak
to take on Lucifer.

230
00:17:12,024 --> 00:17:13,024
So do I.

231
00:17:15,146 --> 00:17:16,946
Believe me, I know exactly

232
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,299
how screwed up I am.

233
00:17:20,395 --> 00:17:22,347
You, Bobby, Cass...

234
00:17:24,047 --> 00:17:25,524
I'm the least of any of you.

235
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:27,813
It's true, it is. But...

236
00:17:29,963 --> 00:17:31,463
I'm also all we got.

237
00:17:32,209 --> 00:17:34,059
If there was another way...

238
00:17:35,977 --> 00:17:38,390
But I don't think there is.
There's just me.

239
00:17:40,006 --> 00:17:42,106
So I don't know what else to do.

240
00:17:43,352 --> 00:17:45,081
Except just try

241
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,397
to do what's got to be done.

242
00:17:49,795 --> 00:17:51,311
And...

243
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,654
Scene.

244
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:58,576
Something you need to see.

245
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:08,297
Niveus pharmaceuticals
is rushing delivery of its new

246
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,129
swine-flu vaccine to

247
00:18:10,254 --> 00:18:13,104
"stem the tide
of the unprecedented outbreak."

248
00:18:15,155 --> 00:18:17,512
- Shipments leave Wednesday.
- Niveus pharmaceuticals.

249
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,556
Get it?

250
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,437
You two are lucky
you have your looks.

251
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,920
Your demon lover, Brady?

252
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:31,867
VP of distribution, Niveus.

253
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,947
Yes, that sound
of the abacus clacking?

254
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:38,834
We all caught up?

255
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,194
- Pestilence was spreading swine flu.
- But not just for giggles.

256
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:44,247
That was step one.
Step two is the vaccine.

257
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,915
- And you think...
- I know.

258
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,783
I'll stake my reputation.

259
00:18:47,908 --> 00:18:49,796
That vaccine
is chock-full of grade-A,

260
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,721
farm-fresh Croatoan virus.

261
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,801
Simultaneous,
countrywide distribution.

262
00:18:58,617 --> 00:18:59,910
It's quite a plan.

263
00:19:00,035 --> 00:19:02,056
They don't get to be horsemen
for nothing.

264
00:19:02,866 --> 00:19:05,909
So, you boys better stock up on...

265
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:07,609
Well, everything.

266
00:19:08,651 --> 00:19:11,900
This time next Thursday,
we'll all be living in Zombieland.

267
00:20:03,063 --> 00:20:04,619
Watch where you're walking, pal.

268
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:48,830
What's your problem?

269
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:52,709
This is what they mean
by "the 11th hour," right?

270
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:53,977
Pretty much.

271
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,796
Well, it's the 11th hour,
and I am useless.

272
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:02,635
All I have is this.
What am I supposed to do?

273
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,220
Point it and shoot.

274
00:21:06,777 --> 00:21:10,184
- What I used to be...
- Are you really gonna bitch to me?

275
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,950
Quit pining for the varsity years...

276
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,229
And load the damn truck.

277
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,623
All right, well...

278
00:21:32,512 --> 00:21:34,584
Good luck stopping
the whole zombie apocalypse.

279
00:21:36,632 --> 00:21:37,921
Good luck killing Death.

280
00:21:44,113 --> 00:21:45,792
Remember when we used to just...

281
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:47,117
Hunt wendigos?

282
00:21:47,886 --> 00:21:49,536
How simple things were?

283
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:51,267
Not really.

284
00:22:00,057 --> 00:22:01,557
You might need this.

285
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,981
Keep it. Dean's covered.

286
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:08,307
Death's own.

287
00:22:08,432 --> 00:22:10,407
Kills, golly, demons

288
00:22:10,532 --> 00:22:12,283
and angels and reapers

289
00:22:12,408 --> 00:22:13,808
and, rumor has it,

290
00:22:14,002 --> 00:22:15,458
the very thing itself.

291
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,679
How did you get that?

292
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,190
Hello!

293
00:22:21,315 --> 00:22:22,785
King of the crossroads.

294
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,402
So, shall we?

295
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,804
Bobby, you just gonna sit there?

296
00:22:28,218 --> 00:22:29,806
No, I'm gonna riverdance.

297
00:22:30,501 --> 00:22:32,642
I suppose
if you wanna impress the ladies.

298
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,233
Really wasted that crossroads deal.

299
00:22:42,604 --> 00:22:44,104
Fact... You get more

300
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,280
if you phrase it properly.

301
00:22:46,536 --> 00:22:48,136
So, I took the liberty

302
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,809
of adding
a teeny little sub-a clause

303
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:52,203
on your behalf.

304
00:22:56,378 --> 00:22:57,458
What can I say?

305
00:22:57,982 --> 00:22:59,002
I'm an altruist.

306
00:23:01,873 --> 00:23:03,089
Just gonna sit there?

307
00:23:28,729 --> 00:23:29,866
Son of a bitch.

308
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:32,285
Yes, I know.
Completely worth your soul.

309
00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:34,159
I'm a hell of a guy.

310
00:23:39,387 --> 00:23:41,017
This is getting maudlin.

311
00:23:41,142 --> 00:23:42,142
Can we go?

312
00:23:55,548 --> 00:23:56,798
Yes to Lucifer.

313
00:23:57,116 --> 00:23:58,478
Then jump in the hole.

314
00:23:59,726 --> 00:24:01,476
It's an interesting plan.

315
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:03,690
That's a word for it.

316
00:24:03,815 --> 00:24:06,486
So, go ahead and tell me
it's the worst plan you ever heard.

317
00:24:07,087 --> 00:24:08,087
Of course.

318
00:24:08,212 --> 00:24:10,760
I am happy to say that
if that's what you wanna hear.

319
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,970
But it's not what I think.

320
00:24:13,795 --> 00:24:14,795
Really?

321
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,582
You and Dean have a habit
of exceeding my expectations.

322
00:24:20,985 --> 00:24:22,161
He resisted Michael.

323
00:24:22,286 --> 00:24:24,336
Maybe you could resist Lucifer.

324
00:24:24,742 --> 00:24:27,005
But there are things
you would need to know.

325
00:24:27,844 --> 00:24:30,051
- Like?
- Michael has found another vessel.

326
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,011
What?

327
00:24:33,217 --> 00:24:34,867
It's your brother Adam.

328
00:24:34,992 --> 00:24:38,292
- You must have considered it.
- We were trying not to.

329
00:24:46,301 --> 00:24:48,051
If you say yes to Lucifer

330
00:24:48,515 --> 00:24:49,815
and then fail...

331
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,875
This fight will happen.

332
00:24:53,795 --> 00:24:55,118
And the collateral...

333
00:24:56,852 --> 00:24:58,202
It'll be immense.

334
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,975
- There's also the demon blood.
- What are you talking about?

335
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,047
To take in Lucifer, it would be
more than you've ever drunk.

336
00:25:10,273 --> 00:25:12,573
- Why?
- It strengthens the vessel.

337
00:25:12,698 --> 00:25:14,887
- Keeps it from exploding.
- The guy he's in now...

338
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,555
Is drinking gallons.

339
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:21,217
And how is that not
the worst plan you ever heard?

340
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:36,489
They're loading up hotshots
of Croatoan in the trucks.

341
00:25:36,614 --> 00:25:38,828
Okay.
First truck don't leave for an hour.

342
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:41,771
We get in,
we plant the C4 every 25 feet,

343
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,500
- Then we pull the fire alarm.
- That truck is leaving.

344
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:48,796
Balls!

345
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,704
Okay, new plan.

346
00:26:11,754 --> 00:26:12,957
It's the Winchesters.

347
00:26:13,082 --> 00:26:15,072
Let's bake them up a little treat.

348
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,900
Side door!

349
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:29,916
Get back!

350
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,520


351
00:27:18,106 --> 00:27:19,106
Help me!

352
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,503
There's still people here.

353
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:25,798
Wait here.

354
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:27,561
Damn.

355
00:27:42,468 --> 00:27:44,018
Let's stop for pizza.

356
00:27:44,354 --> 00:27:47,379
- Are you kidding?
- Just heard it was good, that's all.

357
00:27:48,746 --> 00:27:50,746
Up ahead. Big, ugly building.

358
00:27:51,032 --> 00:27:52,132
Ground zero.

359
00:27:52,257 --> 00:27:54,307
Horseman's stable, if you will.

360
00:27:54,432 --> 00:27:56,716
- He's in there.
- How do you know?

361
00:27:57,351 --> 00:27:59,351
Have you met me? Cause I know.

362
00:28:00,543 --> 00:28:01,943
Also, the block is

363
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,070
squirming with reapers.

364
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:10,709
I'll be right back.

365
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,100
Boy, is my face red.

366
00:28:18,762 --> 00:28:20,031
Death's not in there.

367
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:23,326
Cut the cute
and tell me where he is.

368
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:25,234
Sorry. I don't know.

369
00:28:27,512 --> 00:28:29,512
Wait a minute. You don't know?

370
00:28:30,145 --> 00:28:32,795
Signs pointed.
I'm just as shocked as you.

371
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,029
Bobby sold his soul for this!

372
00:28:36,154 --> 00:28:39,342
Relax.
All deals are soul back or store credit.

373
00:28:39,773 --> 00:28:41,693
We'll catch Death
in the next doomed city.

374
00:28:41,818 --> 00:28:44,847
Millions, Crowley.
Millions are about to die any minute.

375
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,015
True.

376
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,487
So I strongly suggest
we get out of here.

377
00:28:59,418 --> 00:29:00,418
You okay?

378
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,860
So, what?

379
00:29:33,904 --> 00:29:35,818
Call in a bomb threat?
1,000 bomb threats?

380
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:39,360
How am I supposed to get three million
people out of Chicago in 10 minutes?

381
00:29:43,477 --> 00:29:44,477
Come on!

382
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:58,921
What?

383
00:29:59,613 --> 00:30:02,213
- I can't hear you!
- I said I found him.

384
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:04,643
Death, he's in there.

385
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:16,197
You coming or...

386
00:30:20,322 --> 00:30:21,322
Not.

387
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,359
All clear.

388
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,510
Actually,
these things can be useful.

389
00:30:51,511 --> 00:30:54,503
Can we commit our act
of domestic terrorism already?

390
00:30:54,628 --> 00:30:55,628
Let's go.

391
00:31:53,637 --> 00:31:55,437
Thanks for returning that.

392
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,493
Join me, Dean.

393
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:04,429
The pizza's delicious.

394
00:32:25,532 --> 00:32:26,532
Sit down.

395
00:32:32,842 --> 00:32:34,992
Took you long enough to find me.

396
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:37,438
I've been wanting to talk to you.

397
00:32:38,615 --> 00:32:39,815
I gotta say...

398
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,384
Mixed feelings about that.

399
00:32:44,802 --> 00:32:46,481
So is this the part where...

400
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,232
Where you kill me?

401
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:59,792
You have an inflated sense
of your importance.

402
00:33:00,589 --> 00:33:03,089
To a thing like me,
a thing like you...

403
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:04,515
Well...

404
00:33:07,579 --> 00:33:08,739
Think how you'd feel

405
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,964
if a bacterium sat at your table

406
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,698
and started to get snarky.

407
00:33:15,276 --> 00:33:17,026
This is one little planet

408
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:19,613
in one tiny solar system

409
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,800
in a galaxy
that's barely out of its diapers.

410
00:33:23,717 --> 00:33:25,544
I'm old, Dean.

411
00:33:26,566 --> 00:33:27,566
Very old.

412
00:33:28,676 --> 00:33:30,716
So invite you to contemplate

413
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,552
how insignificant I find you.

414
00:33:36,757 --> 00:33:37,757
Eat.

415
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:08,534
Good, isn't it?

416
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,879
Well, I got to ask.

417
00:34:19,763 --> 00:34:22,063
- How old are you?
- As old as God.

418
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,299
Maybe older.

419
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,480
Neither of us can remember anymore.

420
00:34:28,648 --> 00:34:31,026
Life, death, chicken, egg.

421
00:34:31,573 --> 00:34:32,623
Regardless.

422
00:34:33,222 --> 00:34:35,272
At the end, I'll reap Him, too.

423
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:37,875
God?

424
00:34:38,704 --> 00:34:39,785
You'll reap God?

425
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,664
God will die, too, Dean.

426
00:34:51,917 --> 00:34:54,155
Well, this is way above
my pay grade.

427
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,300
Just a bit.

428
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:00,305
Then why am I still breathing,

429
00:35:00,884 --> 00:35:02,484
sitting here with you?

430
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:06,353
- What do you want?
- The leash around my neck off.

431
00:35:07,674 --> 00:35:08,968
Lucifer has me

432
00:35:09,093 --> 00:35:10,243
bound to him.

433
00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:13,111
Some unseemly little spell.

434
00:35:13,652 --> 00:35:17,278
He has me where he wants,
when he wants.

435
00:35:17,403 --> 00:35:19,503
That's why I couldn't go to you.

436
00:35:19,628 --> 00:35:21,828
I had to wait for you to catch up.

437
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,239
He made me his weapon.

438
00:35:26,942 --> 00:35:28,392
Hurricanes, floods,

439
00:35:28,517 --> 00:35:29,867
raising the dead.

440
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,833
I'm more powerful
than you can process,

441
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:35,340
and I'm enslaved to a bratty child

442
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,858
having a tantrum.

443
00:35:38,376 --> 00:35:39,676
And you think...

444
00:35:40,712 --> 00:35:41,764
I can unbind you?

445
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,724
There's your ridiculous
bravado again.

446
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,392
Of course you can't.

447
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,204
But you can help me

448
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:49,772
take the bullets
out of Lucifer's gun.

449
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:55,199
I understand

450
00:35:55,324 --> 00:35:56,524
you want this.

451
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,576
I'm inclined to give it to you.

452
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:05,788
- To give it to me?
- That's what I said.

453
00:36:08,336 --> 00:36:09,686
But what about...

454
00:36:10,455 --> 00:36:11,455
Chicago?

455
00:36:15,457 --> 00:36:17,057
I suppose it can stay.

456
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,390
I like the pizza.

457
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,727
There are conditions.

458
00:36:30,702 --> 00:36:31,752
Okay. Like?

459
00:36:33,094 --> 00:36:34,796
You have to do whatever it takes

460
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:36,771
to put Lucifer in his cell.

461
00:36:38,957 --> 00:36:40,656
- Of course.
- Whatever it takes.

462
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,992
- That's the plan.
- No. No plan. Not yet.

463
00:36:46,017 --> 00:36:47,167
Your brother.

464
00:36:47,292 --> 00:36:50,292
He's the one that can stop Lucifer.
The only one.

465
00:36:52,936 --> 00:36:54,586
- What, you think...
- I know.

466
00:36:56,261 --> 00:36:57,811
So, I need a promise.

467
00:36:58,872 --> 00:37:00,627
You're going to let your brother

468
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:02,988
jump right into that fiery pit.

469
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,080
Well, do I have your word?

470
00:37:26,464 --> 00:37:27,953
That had better be yes.

471
00:37:29,572 --> 00:37:31,373
You know you can't cheat Death.

472
00:37:37,143 --> 00:37:38,143
Now...

473
00:37:38,412 --> 00:37:40,862
Would you like
the instruction manual?

474
00:37:52,352 --> 00:37:53,352


475
00:38:11,278 --> 00:38:13,290
How'd it go at the Rockets audition?

476
00:38:14,908 --> 00:38:15,959
High kicks, fair.

477
00:38:16,314 --> 00:38:17,614
Boobs need work.

478
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,279
I walked up and down stairs

479
00:38:20,404 --> 00:38:22,354
all night for no damn reason.

480
00:38:22,781 --> 00:38:23,781
I'm sore.

481
00:38:26,088 --> 00:38:27,288
Feels so good,

482
00:38:27,837 --> 00:38:29,473
I'm scared it's a dream.

483
00:38:30,257 --> 00:38:31,649
But then I remember that

484
00:38:31,774 --> 00:38:33,824
the world's dying bloody, so...

485
00:38:34,194 --> 00:38:35,194
Drink?

486
00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:41,818
Check it out.

487
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:56,541
Death told you how to operate?

488
00:38:56,921 --> 00:38:59,271
- The whole deal?
- Yeah. It's nuts.

489
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:02,798
Of course,
I got bigger problems now.

490
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,257
Really? Like?

491
00:39:05,665 --> 00:39:08,428
What do you think Death does
to people who lie to his face?

492
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:10,197
Nothing good.

493
00:39:10,795 --> 00:39:12,045
What'd you say?

494
00:39:15,299 --> 00:39:17,139
That I was cool with Sam
driving the bus

495
00:39:17,264 --> 00:39:18,605
on the whole Lucifer plan.

496
00:39:21,232 --> 00:39:23,443
So Death thinks Sam
ought to say yes,?

497
00:39:24,088 --> 00:39:25,238
I don't know.

498
00:39:28,357 --> 00:39:30,617
But of course he'd say that.
He works for Lucifer.

499
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,869
Against his will, I thought he said.

500
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,469
I'd say, take his sob story
with a fat grain of salt.

501
00:39:35,594 --> 00:39:36,999
I mean, he is Death.

502
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,120
Exactly. He's Death.

503
00:39:39,786 --> 00:39:42,004
Think of the kind of
bird's-eye view.

504
00:39:43,188 --> 00:39:44,756
- Seriously?
- I'm just saying.

505
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,759
Don't. I mean,
what happened to you being against this?

506
00:39:48,196 --> 00:39:50,846
I'm not saying Sam
ain't an ass-full of character defects.

507
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:52,264
- But...
- But what?

508
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:55,434
Back at Niveus?

509
00:39:55,972 --> 00:39:57,421
I watched that kid pull

510
00:39:57,546 --> 00:39:59,596
one civilian out after another.

511
00:40:00,345 --> 00:40:01,857
He must have saved 10 people.

512
00:40:02,028 --> 00:40:04,178
Never stopped. Never slowed down.

513
00:40:05,344 --> 00:40:06,763
We're hard on him, Dean.

514
00:40:06,888 --> 00:40:08,030
We've always been.

515
00:40:09,085 --> 00:40:10,971
But in the meantime...

516
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:14,077
He's been running
into burning buildings

517
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,574
since he was, what, 12?

518
00:40:15,699 --> 00:40:16,799
Pretty much.

519
00:40:17,509 --> 00:40:19,423
Look, Sam's got a...

520
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:22,001
Darkness in him.

521
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:24,205
I'm not saying he don't.

522
00:40:24,804 --> 00:40:27,510
But he's got a hell
of a lot of good in him, too.

523
00:40:30,169 --> 00:40:31,169
I know.

524
00:40:31,837 --> 00:40:32,987
Then you know

525
00:40:33,112 --> 00:40:34,812
Sam will beat the devil.

526
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,870
Or die trying.

527
00:40:39,277 --> 00:40:41,327
That's the best we can ask for.

528
00:40:44,907 --> 00:40:46,507
So I got to ask, Dean.

529
00:40:48,035 --> 00:40:49,988
What exactly are you afraid of?

530
00:40:52,027 --> 00:40:53,027
Losing?

531
00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:55,786
Or losing your brother?
