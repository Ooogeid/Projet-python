Seasone 3 epsiode 11

3
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,770
Back in 1835, samuel colt made a gun.

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,490
They say this gun can kill anything.

5
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,700
Bela talbot's her real name.

6
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:32,860
Is she a hunter?

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,700
She's pretty freaking far from a hunter.

8
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,000
The colt. Bela stole the colt.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,560
I need your help.
Help with what?

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,420
-With sam.
-You need to help me get him ready

11
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,670
To fight this war on his own.

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,860
Rise and shine, sammy!

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,530
Dude. Asia?

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,260
Come on. You love this song and you know it.

15
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,960
Yeah, and if i ever hear 
it again, i'm gonna kill myself.

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,440
What?

17
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,740
Sorry. I can't hear you.

18
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,660
Whenever you're ready, dean.

19
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,450
This yours?

20
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,830
Bingo.

21
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,160
Now, who's ready for some breakfast?

22
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,160
Drive safely now, mr. Pickett.

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,760
Yeah, yeah.

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,930
Can't stay unless you order something, cal.

25
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,470
You know the rules.

26
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,730
Some coffee.

27
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,460
Hey. Tuesday. Pig 'n a poke.

28
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,260
Do you even know what that is?

29
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,250
Are you boys ready?
Yes.

30
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,300
I'll have the special, 
a side of bacon, and a coffee.

31
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,260
Make it two coffees and a short stack.

32
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:19,750
You got it.

33
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,260
I'm telling you, sam, this job is small-Fry.

34
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,910
We should be spending our time hunting down bela.

35
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,700
Okay, sure. Let's get right on that. 
Where is she again? Shut up.

36
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,760
Believe me, i want to find her as bad as you do.

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,030
In the meantime, we have this.

38
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,960
All right, so this professor...

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,060
Dexter hasselback. He was passing through 
town last week when he vanished.

40
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,630
Last known location?

41
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,100
His daughter says he was on his way

42
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,420
To visit the broward county mystery spot.

43
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,780
"Where the laws of physics have no meaning!"?

44
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,300
Two coffees -- Black, 

45
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,400
And some hot sauce for the...

46
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,900
Whoops.

47
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,850
Crap. Sorry.

48
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,030
Clean up!

49
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,100
Sam, you know joints like this

50
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,220
Are only tourist traps, right?

51
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,230
I mean, you know, balls rolling uphill, 

52
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,730
Furniture nailed to the ceiling.

53
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,030
The only danger's to your wallet.

54
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,940
Okay, look. I'm just saying 
there are spots in the world

55
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,350
Where holes open up and swallow people --

56
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,430
The bermuda triangle, the oregon vortex.

57
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,860
Broward county mystery spot?

58
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,400
Well, sometimes these places are legit.

59
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,700
All right, so if it is legit --

60
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,430
And that's a big-Ass "if" -- What's the lore?

61
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,330
Well -- Excuse me.

62
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,870
The lore's pretty freaking nuts, actually.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,900
I mean, they say these places, 

64
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,470
The magnetic fields are so strong

65
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,300
That they can bend space-Time, 

66
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,330
Sending victims no one knows where.

67
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,200
Sounds a little "x files" to me.

68
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,630
I told you it wouldn't fit!

69
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,100
What do you want, a pulitzer?

70
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,960
All right, look, i'm not saying 
this is really happening, 

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,460
But if it is, we got to check it out, 

72
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,630
See if we can do something.

73
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,700
All right, all right.

74
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,750
We'll go tonight after they close, 

75
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,260
Get ourselves a nice, long look.

76
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,520
Wow. Uncanny.

77
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,290
Find anything?

78
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,570
No.

79
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,220
Do you have any idea what you're looking for?

80
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,410
Uh...yeah.

81
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,790
No.

82
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,710
What the hell you doing here?

83
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa. We can explain.

84
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,960
You robbing me?

85
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,630
Look, nobody's robbing you. Calm down.

86
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,440
Don't move. Don't move!

87
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,990
I'm just putting the gun down.

88
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,370
Dean!

89
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,460
Call 911.

90
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
I -- I didn't mean...

91
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,360
Now!

92
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,960
No. No. No.

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,260
Not like this.

94
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,880
Dean.

97
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,930
Dude. Asia.

98
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,860
Dean.

99
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,860
Oh, come on.

100
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,540
You love this song and you know it.

101
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,390
What?

102
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,450
I don't know.

103
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,330
You all right?

104
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,750
No. I think i...

105
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,410
Man, i had a weird dream.

106
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,740
Yeah? Clowns or midgets?

107
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,490
Drive safely now, mr. Pickett.

108
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,850
Yeah, yeah.

109
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,940
???????????  ??
Can't stay unless you order something, cal.

110
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,240
??????
You know the rules.

111
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,040
????
Coffee.

112
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,520
???
Hey. Tuesday.

113
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,780
???
Pig 'n a poke.

114
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,260
????
It's tuesday?

115
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,730
??
Yeah.

116
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,880
Are you boys ready? Yes.

117
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,570
I'll have the special, side of bacon, and a coffee.

118
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,570
Uh, nothing for me. Thanks.

119
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,990
Let me know if you change your mind.

120
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,700
I'm telling you, sam, this job is small-Fry.

121
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,650
We should be spending our time hunting down bela.

122
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,050
You with me?

123
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,160
What?

124
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,440
You sure you feel okay?

125
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,460
You don't...

126
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,960
You don't remember any of this?

127
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,930
Remember what?

128
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,430
This. Today.

129
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,130
Like -- Like it's -- Like it's happened before?

130
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,360
You mean like déjà vu?

131
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,090
No. I mean like it's --

132
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,030
Like it's really happened before.

133
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,650
Yeah. Like déjà vu.

134
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,540
No. Forget about déjà vu.

135
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,290
I'm asking you if it feels like --

136
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,650
Like we're living yesterday all over again.

137
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,360
- Okay, how is that not déjà vu...
- Don't!

138
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,950
Don't say it! Just don't even...

139
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,300
Coffee -- Black, 

140
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,530
And some hot sauce for the...

141
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,730
Whoops! Crap.

142
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,070
Thanks!

143
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,670
Nice reflexes.

144
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,610
Sam, i'm sorry.

145
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,090
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

146
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,960
Okay, look. Yesterday was tuesday, right?

147
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,340
But today is tuesday, too.

148
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,470
Yeah. No. Good. You're totally balanced.

149
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,000
So you don't believe me?

150
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,280
Excuse me.

151
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,190
Look, i'm just saying that it's crazy, you know?

152
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,490
Even-For-Us crazy. Dingo-Ate-My-Baby crazy.

153
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,650
Hey, maybe it was another one 
of your psychic premonitions.

154
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,340
No. No way. Way too vivid.

155
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,670
Okay, look. We were at 
the mystery spot, and then...

156
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,810
And then what?

157
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,630
Then i woke up.

158
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,040
I told you it wouldn't fit!

159
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,000
What do you want, a pulitzer?

160
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,870
Wait a minute! The mystery spot.

161
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,900
You think maybe it...

162
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,980
Maybe what?

163
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,830
We got to check that place out.

164
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,760
Just go with me on this.

165
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,760
All right. All right.

166
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,200
We'll go tonight after close, 

167
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,760
Get ourselves a nice, long look.

168
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,860
Wait. What?

169
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,350
- No.
- Why not?

170
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,870
Uh...let's just go now.

171
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,790
Right now. Business hours.

172
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,830
Nice and crowded.

173
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,690
My god, you're a freak.

174
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,630
Dean.

175
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,410
Okay! Whatever. We'll go now.

176
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,620
Dean!

177
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,560
Dean. No. No. No.

178
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,200
Come on. Dean.

179
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,410
Hey. Dean.

180
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,130
Dean. Dean.

181
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,620
Rise and shine, sammy!

182
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,400
Hey. Tuesday. Pig 'n a poke.

183
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,290
Would you listen to me, dean?
Cause i am flipping out.

184
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,520
Are you boys ready?

185
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,630
He'll take the special, side of bacon, coffee -- Black.

186
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,730
Nothing for me. Thanks.

187
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,010
You got it.

188
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,510
Sammy, i get all tingly when you take control like that.

189
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,970
Quit screwing around, dean.

190
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,400
Okay. Okay. I'm listening. So...so...

191
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,940
Now, you think that you're in some kind of a what?

192
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,020
Time loop.

193
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,920
Like "groundhog day."

194
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,860
Yes. Exactly. Like "groundhog day."

195
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,650
So you don't believe me?

196
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,470
It's -- It's a little crazy. Even-For-Us crazy.

197
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,070
You know, like...

198
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,610
...dingo-Ate-My-Baby crazy?

199
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,080
How'd you know i was gonna say that?

200
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,390
Ecause you've said it before, 
dean. That's my whole point.

201
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,650
Coffee -- Black, 

202
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,570
And some hot sauce for the...

203
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,300
Whoops! Crap.

204
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,360
Thanks.

205
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,220
Nice reflexes.

206
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,100
No. I knew it was gonna happen.

207
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,530
Okay, look.

208
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,230
I'm sure that there's some sort of an explanation.

209
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,820
You're just gonna have to go with
me on this, all right, dean?

210
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,680
You just have to. You owe me that much.

211
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,040
Calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down!

212
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,570
I can't calm down. I can't because...

213
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,990
Because what?

214
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,580
Because you die today, dean.

215
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,750
I'm not gonna die. Not today.

216
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:48,920
Twice now, i've watched you die.

217
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,060
And i can't.

218
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,590
I won't do it again, okay?

219
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,330
And you're just gonna have to believe me.

220
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,560
Please.

221
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,240
All right.

222
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,160
I still think you're nuts, but...

223
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,760
Okay. Whatever this is, we'll figure it out.

224
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,840
Excuse me.

225
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,460
I told you it wouldn't fit!

226
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,650
What do you want, a pulitzer?

227
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,470
And you think this cheesy-Ass tourist trap

228
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,290
Has something to do with it.

229
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,510
Maybe it's the real deal, you know?

230
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,970
The -- The magnetic fields bending space-Time or whatever.

231
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,020
That all seems a little too "x files" for me.

232
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,600
Well, i don't know how else to explain it, dean!

233
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,550
All right! All right.

234
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,850
We'll go tonight after they close, 

235
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,100
Get ourselves a nice, long look.

236
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,490
No, no, no, no. We can't.

237
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,660
Why not?

238
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,670
Because you...

239
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,450
I what?

240
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,980
I die there?

241
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,050
Blown away, actually.

242
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,320
Okay. Let's go now.

243
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,090
Get out of the way!

244
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,290
What, did he...

245
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,910
Yesterday. Yeah.

246
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,380
And?

247
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,120
And what?

248
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,850
Did it look cool like in the movies?

249
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,720
You peed yourself.

250
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,080
Of course i peed myself.

251
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,870
A man gets hit by a car, 

252
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,650
You think he has full control over his bladder?

253
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,820
Come on!

254
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,100
Boys, i can't tell you how much i appreciate this.

255
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,730
We could use all the good ink we can get.

256
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,660
How long have you owned the place, mr. Carpiak?

257
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,760
Well, my family's been guarding the secrets here

258
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,330
Since you don't want to know when.

259
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,270
So you'd know if anything strange happened?

260
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,660
Strange?

261
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,850
Strange happens here all the time.

262
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,420
It's a mystery spot.

263
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,490
What exactly does that mean?

264
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,780
Well, uh...

265
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,560
It's where the laws of physics...

266
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,760
Have no meaning.

267
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,560
Okay. Like how?

268
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,650
Take the tour.

269
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,680
The guy who went missing -- Dexter hasselback --

270
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,730
He take the tour?

271
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,690
Hold on a minute. What kind of article is this?

272
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,170
Just answer the question.

273
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,020
The police scoured every inch of this place.

274
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,950
They couldn't find that man. I never seen him before.

275
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,960
- We're a family establishment.
- Listen to me.

276
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,690
There's something weird going on here.

277
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,410
Now, do you know anything about it or not?

278
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,250
Okay, look.

279
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,750
Guys, um, give it a break.

280
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,040
I bought the joint at a foreclosure auction

281
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,670
Last march, all right?

282
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,900
Hell, i used to sell bail bonds.

283
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,850
Okay, kojak. Let's get some air.

284
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,160
I hate to say it, but that place

285
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,290
Is exactly what i thought -- It's full of crap.

286
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,120
So what is it, then, dean?

287
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,390
What the hell is happening to us?

288
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,760
I don't know.

289
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,290
All right, let me just...

290
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,580
So, every day i die.

291
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,690
Yeah.

292
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,750
That's when you wake up again, right?

293
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,850
Yeah.

294
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,640
So let's just make sure i don't die.

295
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,970
If i make it to tomorrow, 

296
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,410
Then maybe the loop stops and we can figure all this out.

297
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,830
Do you think?

298
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,180
It's worth a shot.

299
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,270
I say we grab some takeout, head back to the motel, 

300
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,630
Lay low until midnight.

301
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:28,960
All right, good.

302
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,330
Who wants chinese?

303
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,940
Rise and shine, sammy!

304
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,050
I still think you're nuts.

305
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,960
But whatever this is, we'll figure it out.

306
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,660
Thanks.

307
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,520
So, uh...

308
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,540
If you're stuck in "groundhog day, " why?

309
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,810
What's behind it?

310
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,460
First i thought it was the mystery spot.

311
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,820
Now i'm not so sure.

312
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,230
What do we do?

313
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,660
Well, we keep you breathing, try to make it to tomorrow.

314
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,900
I mean, that's the only thing i can think of.

315
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,560
Shouldn't be too hard.

316
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,030
Yeah, right. Dean, i've watched you die a few times now, 

317
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,530
And i can't ever seem to stop it.

318
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,030
Well, nothing's set in stone.

319
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,600
You say i order the same thing every day, right?

320
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,760
Yeah. Pig 'n a poke, side of bacon.

321
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,300
Excuse me, sweetheart.

322
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,530
Can i get sausage instead of bacon?

323
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,820
Sure thing, hon.

324
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,700
See? Different day already.

325
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,310
You see, if you and i decide that i am not gonna die, 

326
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,080
I'm not gonna die.

327
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,300
Thank you.

328
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,530
Dean.

329
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,150
Dean.

330
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,930
You mean we can't even go out for breakfast?

331
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,900
You'll thank me when it's wednesday!

332
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,960
Whatever that means.

333
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,000
Do these tacos taste funny to you?

334
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,460
Everybody's fine. Nobody's gonna get hurt, okay?

335
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,640
Sammy?

336
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,730
Maybe you should drop the ax and let this guy go.

337
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,900
What do you say?

338
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,860
Something's got to be going on here.

339
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,230
I intend to find out what.

340
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,300
Place is tore up pretty good, dude.

341
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,840
Time to give it a rest.

342
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,100
No!

343
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,160
I'm gonna take it down to studs.

344
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,960
Sammy, that's enough. Give me the ax.

345
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,260
Give me the ax! This is crazy!

346
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,400
Leave it, dean!

347
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,560
Come on!

348
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,730
Get off!

349
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,330
Oh, my god, dean!

350
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,780
Drive safely now, mr. Pickett.

351
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,250
Yeah, yeah.

352
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,320
Can't stay unless you order something, cal.

353
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,560
You know the rules.

354
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,900
Coffee.

355
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,460
Hey. Tuesday. Pig 'n a poke.

356
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,200
What are those?

357
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,700
The old man's.

358
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,460
Trust me. You don't want him behind the wheel.

359
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,820
You boys ready?

360
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,620
Yes, we are.

361
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,860
I'll have the special, a side of bacon, and a coffee.

362
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,160
Hey, doris.

363
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,000
What i'd like is for you to log in some more hours

364
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,160
At the archery range.

365
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,030
- You're a terrible shot.
- How do you know --

366
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,260
Lucky guess.

367
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,230
Okay, so, you think you're caught

368
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,500
In some kind of what again?

369
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,830
Time loop.

370
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,180
Like "groundhog day."

371
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,430
It doesn't matter. There's no way to stop it.

372
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,960
Jeez. Aren't you grumpy?

373
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,500
Yeah, i am. You want to know why?

374
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,150
Why?

375
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,380
Because this is the 100th tuesday in a row

376
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,920
I've been through, and it never stops.

377
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,330
Ever. So, yeah, i'm a little grumpy.

378
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,430
Hot sauce.

379
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,000
What?

380
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,630
Coffee -- Black, 

381
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,860
And some hot sauce for the -- Whoops!

382
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,130
Crap. Thanks!

383
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,100
Nice reflexes.

384
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,050
I knew it was gonna happen, dean.

385
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,750
I know everything that's gonna happen.

386
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,230
You don't know everything.

387
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,660
Yeah. I do.

388
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,160
Yeah, right.Yeah, right.

389
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,800
Nice guess.Nice guess.

390
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,060
It wasn't a guess.

391
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,030
Right, you're a mind reader.

392
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,130
Cut it out, sam.

393
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,460
Sam!Sam!

394
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,630
You think you're being funny, 

395
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,200
But you're being really, really childish.

396
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,530
Sam winchester wears makeup.

397
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,700
Sam winchester cries his way through sex.

398
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,500
Sam winchester keeps a ruler by the bed, 

399
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,230
And every morning, when he wakes up...

400
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,430
Okay, enough!

401
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,100
That's not all.

402
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,430
Randy, the cashier?

403
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,270
He's skimming from the register.

404
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,100
Judge meyers?

405
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,470
At night, he puts on a furry bunny outfit.

406
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,760
Over there -- That's cal.

407
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,100
He's gonna rob tony the mechanic on the way home.

408
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,400
What's your point?

409
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:49,280
My point is i've lived through every possible tuesday.

410
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,300
I've watched you die every possible way.

411
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,880
I have ripped apart the mystery spot, 

412
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,340
Burnt it down, tried everything i know to save your life, 

413
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,450
And i can't.

414
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,100
No matter what i do, you die, 

415
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,050
And then i wake up.

416
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,160
And then it's tuesday again.

417
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,760
The dog.

418
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,420
There's got to be some way out of this.

419
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,660
"Where's my dang keys?"

420
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,000
Where's my dang keys?

421
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,960
"Excuse me."

422
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,310
Excuse me.

423
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,020
She's kind of cute.

424
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,360
All the times we've walked down this street, 

425
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,660
I ever do this?

426
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,430
Excuse me. Miss?

427
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,060
No.

428
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,930
100 tuesdays, you never bothered to check

429
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,730
What she was holding in her hands?

430
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,070
This the guy who went missing?

431
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,130
- Yeah.
- That's his daughter back there.

432
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,930
Hey, buddy. Somebody need a friend?

433
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,360
So, the police report says dexter hasselback

434
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,940
Is a professor, but that's not all he is.

435
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:16,970
What is he?

436
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,890
I talked to his daughter. The guy's quite the journalist.

437
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,300
Columns in magazines, a blog.

438
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,700
He writes about tourist attractions --

439
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,160
Mystery spots, ufo crash sites.

440
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,660
He gets his kicks debunking them.

441
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,160
I mean, he's already put four of these places out of business.

442
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,260
Here.

443
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,430
Truth warrior"?

444
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,260
More like a pompous schmuck, you ask me.

445
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,530
Yeah. Tell me about it.

446
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,070
I mean, i've read everything the guy's ever written.

447
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,930
He must have weighed a ton, he was so full of himself.

448
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,700
When did you have time to do all this research?

449
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:51,240
Come on.

450
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,430
What?

451
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,700
It's funny, you know.

452
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,900
I mean, this guy spends his whole life

453
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:01,080
Crapping on mystery spots and then he vanishes in one.

454
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,100
It's kind of poetic, you know? Like just desserts.

455
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,200
You're right. That is just deserts.

456
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,650
What's wrong?

457
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,560
Guy has maple syrup for the past 100 tuesdays --

458
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,730
All of a sudden, he's having strawberry?

459
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,930
It's a free country.

460
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,530
Man can't choose his own syrup, huh?

461
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,000
What have we become?

462
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:34,000
Not in this diner. Not today.

463
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:37,760
Nothing in this place ever changes -- Ever.

464
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,400
Except me.

465
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,830
Rise and shine, sammy!

466
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,360
So, you think you're caught in some kind of what again?

467
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,160
Eat your breakfast.

468
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,260
What's in the bag?

469
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,500
Hey!

470
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,830
- Hey.
- I know who you are.

471
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,100
Or should i say "what"?

472
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:37,230
- Oh, my god. Please, don't kill me.
- Uh, sam...

473
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,760
-It took me a hell of a long time, but i got it.
-What?

474
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,230
It's your m.O. That gave you away.

475
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,300
Going after pompous jerks, giving them their just deserts.

476
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,560
Your kind loves that, don't they?

477
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,900
Yeah, sure. Okay.

478
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,100
Just put the stake down.

479
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,500
- Sam, maybe you should...
- No!

480
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,430
There's only one creature powerful enough

481
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,560
To do what you're doing --

482
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,030
Making reality out of nothing, 

483
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,530
Sticking people in time loops.

484
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,900
In fact, you'd pretty much have to be a god.

485
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,060
You'd have to be a trickster.

486
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,900
Mister, my name is ed coleman. My wife's name's amelia.

487
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:05,930
I got two kids.

488
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,300
For crying out loud, i sell ad space!

489
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,560
Don't lie to me! I know what you are!

490
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,500
We've killed one of your kind before!

491
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,160
Actually, bucko, you didn't.

492
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,060
You're joking, right?

493
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,630
You chuckleheads tried to kill me last time.

494
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,700
Why wouldn't i do this?

495
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,460
And hasselback -- What about him?

496
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,660
That putz?

497
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,730
He said he didn't believe in wormholes, 

498
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,330
So i dropped him in one.

499
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,930
Then you guys showed up.

500
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,560
I made you the second you hit town.

501
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,560
So this is fun for you?

502
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,560
Killing dean over and over again?

503
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,000
One... yes, it is fun, 

504
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:02,530
And two... this is so not about killing dean.

505
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:07,430
This joke is on you, sam.

506
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,060
Watching your brother die every day.

507
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,760
Forever.

508
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,330
You son of a bitch.

509
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,430
How long will it take you to realize

510
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,200
You can't save your brother...

511
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,060
...no matter what?

512
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,100
Oh, yeah?

513
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,000
I kill you, this all ends now.

514
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,330
Oh, hey! Whoa. Okay.

515
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,130
Okay. Look.

516
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,930
I was just playing around.

517
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,630
You can't take a joke, fine. You're out of it.

518
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,060
Tomorrow, you wake up, it'll be wednesday.

519
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,000
I swear.

520
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,360
You're lying.

521
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,260
If i am, you know where to find me --

522
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,230
Having pancakes at the diner.

523
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,360
No. Easier to just kill you.

524
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,230
Sorry, kiddo. Can't have that.

525
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,800
- What, are you gonna sleep all day?
- No asia.

526
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,760
Yeah, i know. This station sucks.

527
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,000
It's wednesday!

528
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:20,500
Yeah, which usually comes after tuesday.

529
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,130
Turn that thing off, would you?

530
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,600
What, are you kidding?

531
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:26,900
- This isn't the most beautiful song you've ever heard?
- No.

532
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:29,100
Jeez. How many tuesdays did you have?

533
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,830
I don't know. I lost count.

534
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,030
Hey, wait. What do you remember?

535
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,160
I remember you were pretty 
whacked out of it yesterday, 

536
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
Then i remember running into the trickster.

537
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,560
But, no, that's about it.

538
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,030
All right. Pack your stuff.

539
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,830
Let's get the hell out of town -- Now.

540
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,860
No breakfast?

541
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,360
No breakfast.

542
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,230
Are you sure we should just 
let the trickster go?

543
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,800
Give me your wallet.

544
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy. Just relax.

545
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,260
I am relaxed!

546
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,660
Okay. All right.

547
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,330
Nobody wants this to end the wrong way.

548
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,460
Let's talk about it a sec.

549
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,830
Dean!

550
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,930
No. No, no, no, no.No no

551
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,760
Hey. Hey. Come on.

552
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,330
Not today. Not today.

553
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,960
This isn't supposed to happen today.

554
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,200
Come on.

555
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,760
I'm supposed to wake up.

556
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,530
This is sam. Leave a message.

557
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,960
Sam, it's bobby.

558
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,600
Heard about that demon thing

559
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,660
You took care of in death valley.

560
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,300
Nice job.

561
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,900
It's been about three 
months we talked, though.

562
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,930
It'd be nice to hear your voice.

563
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,700
Give a call. I'm here.

564
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,200
Sam? Bobby again.

565
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,300
Look, i'm worried about you.

566
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,960
Just tell me you're not sitting alone somewhere, 

567
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,900
Obsessing over this damn trickster.

568
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,660
Call me, sam. We can find it together.

569
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,260
No one man should take 
something like this on alone.

570
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,030
You hear me?

571
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,800
By the way, that vampire nest in austin...

572
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,300
Hell of a job.

573
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,200
Sam? It's bobby.

574
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,900
I found him.

575
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,130
It's good to see you, boy.

576
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,260
What are we doing here, bobby?

577
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,860
This is the last place, for sure, 

578
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,400
The trickster worked his magic.

579
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,430
So?

580
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,330
So, you want this thing?

581
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,500
I found a summoning ritual 
to bring the trickster here.

582
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,330
What do we need?

583
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,660
Blood.

584
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,600
How much blood?

585
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:33,430
Ritual says near a gallon. It's got to be fresh, too.

586
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,130
Meaning we have to bleed a person dry.

587
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,900
And it's got to be tonight, 

588
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,660
Or not for another 50 years.

589
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,500
Then let's go get some.

590
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,560
You break my heart, kid.

591
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,360
What?

592
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,360
I'm not gonna let you murder an innocent man.

593
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,200
Then why'd you bring me here?

594
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,730
Why?

595
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,800
Cause it was the only way you'd see me.

596
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,530
Cause i'm trying to knock some sense into you.

597
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,500
Because i thought you'd back 
down from killing a man.

598
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,330
Well, you thought wrong.

599
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,060
Leave the stuff. I'll do it myself.

600
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,900
I told you, i'm not gonna let you kill anyone.

601
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,260
It's none of your damn business what i do!

602
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:28,900
You want your brother back so bad...

603
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,900
...fine.

604
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,400
What are you talking about?

605
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,560
Better me than a civilian.

606
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,960
You're crazy, bobby. I'm not killing you.

607
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,730
Oh. Now i'm the crazy one.

608
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,160
Look, sam.

609
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,730
I'm old.

610
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,860
I'm coming near the end of my trail.

611
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,600
But you can keep fighting, saving folk.

612
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:11,160
But you need your brother.

613
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
So let me give him back to you.

614
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,960
Bobby...

615
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,730
You and dean, you...

616
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,800
You boys are the closest thing i have to family.

617
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,000
I want to do this.

618
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,400
Okay.

619
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,960
Good.

620
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,200
Just make it quick.

621
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:52,230
Do it, son.

622
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,460
Yeah, okay, bobby.

623
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,130
But you want to know why?

624
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,700
Because you're not bobby.

625
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,330
Bobby.

626
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,330
Bobby.

627
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,730
Bobby!

628
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:40,100
You're right. I was just screwing with you.

629
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:43,260
Pretty good, though, sam. Smart.

630
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,030
Let me tell ya.

631
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,330
Whoever said dean was the dysfunctional one

632
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,060
Has never seen you with a sharp 
object in your hands.

633
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,230
Holy "full metal jacket."

634
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,230
Bring him back.

635
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,030
Who? Dean?

636
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,600
Didn't my girl send you the flowers?

637
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:06,660
Dean's dead. He ain't coming back.

638
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,630
His soul's downstairs doing 
the hellfire rumba as we speak.

639
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,730
Just take us back to that tuesday 
-- Or wednesday

640
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,330
When it all started, please.

641
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,160
We won't come after you. I swear.

642
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,060
You swear?

643
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,400
Yes.

644
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,700
I don't know.

645
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,300
Even if i could...

646
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,360
- You can.
- True.

647
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,260
But that don't mean i should.

648
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:33,430
Sam, there's a lesson here

649
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,960
That i've been trying to drill

650
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,600
Into that freakish, cro-Magnon skull of yours.

651
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:42,230
Lesson? What lesson?

652
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,330
This obsession to save dean.

653
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,530
The way you two keep sacrificing
yourselves for each other.

654
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,800
Nothing good comes out of it.

655
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,730
Just blood and pain.

656
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,100
Dean's your weakness.

657
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:05,060
The bad guys know it, too.

658
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,300
He's gonna be the death of you, sam.

659
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Sometimes you just got to let people go.

660
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,330
He's my brother.

661
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,700
Yep.

662
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:22,860
And like it or not, 

663
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,460
This is what life's gonna be like without him.

664
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,730
Please. Just...

665
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,860
Please.

666
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:40,030
I swear, it's like talking to a brick wall.

667
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,760
Okay, look.

668
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,730
This all stopped being fun months ago.

669
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,960
You're travis bickel in a skirt, pal.

670
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,130
I'm over it.

671
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,560
Meaning what?

672
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,560
Meaning that's for me to know and you to find out.

673
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,730
What, are you gonna sleep all day?

674
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,030
I know. No asia. This station sucks.

675
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,300
It's wednesday.

676
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,800
Yeah. Which usually follows tuesday.

677
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,230
Turn that thing off.

678
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,130
Dude, how many tuesdays did you have?

679
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,500
Enough.

680
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,660
Wait.

681
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,630
What do you remember?

682
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,660
I remember you were pretty whacked out yesterday.

683
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,560
I remember catching up with the trickster.

684
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,360
That's about it.

685
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,930
Let's go.

686
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,030
No breakfast?

687
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,560
No breakfast.

688
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,830
All right. I'll pack the car.

689
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,530
Wait. You're not going anywhere alone.

690
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,200
It's the parking lot, sam.

691
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,230
Just...

692
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,230
Just trust me.

693
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,200
Hey, you don't look so good. Something else happen?

694
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,730
I just had a really weird dream.

695
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,460
Clowns or midgets?
