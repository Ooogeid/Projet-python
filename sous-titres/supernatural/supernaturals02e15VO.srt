an old married couple.

179
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,600
No, see, married couples
can get divorced.

180
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,400
Me and hme?
We're like, uh, siamese twins.

181
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,800
It's "conjoined" twins.
See what I mean?

182
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Look, it --

183
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,100
We've just been on the road
for too long,

184
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,600
Tight quarters, all that.

185
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,000
Don't worry about it.

186
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Okay.

187
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,100
So, anyway, we figured
it might be a haunting,

188
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,500
So we went to check out
the scene of the crime.

189
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,100
So, how long have you been
working here?

190
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,900
Janitor: I've been mopping
these floors for six years.

191
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,300
There you go, guys.

192
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,700
What the heck's that for?

193
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,900
Just find the wire
in the walls.

194
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,900
Ah. Well.

195
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,200
<i>Not sure why you're wiring up
this office.</i>

196
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,000
Not gonna do the professor
much good.

197
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Why's that?

198
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,000
He's dead.
Oh.

199
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What happened?

200
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,700
He went out that window
right there.

201
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,200
Yeah? Were you working
that night?

202
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,500
I'm the one who found him.

203
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
You see it happen?
Nope.

204
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,800
I just saw him come up here
and, uh...

205
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,400
Well...
what?

206
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,600
<i>He wasn't alone.</i>

207
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,700
Who was he with?

208
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,000
Come on!
I ate one, maybe two.

209
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,600
Just let me tell it,
okay?

210
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,400
He was with a young lady.

211
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,000
I told the cops about her,

212
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,200
But I guess they never
found her.

213
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,100
You saw this girl
go in, huh?

214
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,600
But did you ever
see her come out?

215
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,200
Now that you
mention it, no.

216
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,200
You ever see her before,
around?

217
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,100
Not her.

218
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
What do you mean?

219
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,800
I don't mean to cast aspersions
on a dead guy, but, uh...

220
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,100
Mr. Morality here?

221
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,100
<i>He brought a lot of girls
up here.</i>

222
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,000
Got more ass
than a toilet seat.

223
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
One more thing.

224
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,200
This building -- It only
has four stories, right?

225
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,900
Yeah.

226
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,500
So there wouldn't be
a room 669?

227
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,400
Of course not.
Why do you ask?

228
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,200
Ah, just curious.

229
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,700
Thanks.
Sure.

230
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,400
Well, no traces of emf,
that's for sure.

231
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,200
And that room 669's
a load of crap.

232
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,300
So, what do you think?
The professor's just a jumper?

233
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,400
A legend's just a legend?
I don't know.

234
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,600
The girl that
the janitor described --

235
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,300
That's pretty weird.
Yeah.

236
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,500
We ought to check out
the history on the building.

237
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,600
See if any coed
ganked herself there.

238
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,700
Yeah, you're right.

239
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,000
Dude,
were you on my computer?

240
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,500
No.
Oh, really?

241
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,800
'Cause it's frozen now

242
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,400
On -- On
bustyasianbeauties.Com.

243
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,500
Dean...

244
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,900
Would you just -- Don't touch
my stuff anymore, okay?

245
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,100
Why don't you control
your ocd?

246
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,100
But did you dig up anything
about the building,

247
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,300
Or on the suicidal coed?

248
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,900
No. History's clean.

249
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,100
Then it's not a haunting.

250
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,400
Maybe not.

251
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,000
Tell you the truth,
we're not really sure.

252
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,500
What do you mean
you're not sure?

253
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,000
Well...it's weird.

254
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,100
What's weird?

255
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,000
This next part, we, uh...

256
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,400
We didn't see it happen
ourselves, exactly, but...

257
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,400
It's pretty friggin' weird,
even for us.

258
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,300
Aaaaaah!

259
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,700
Aliens?
Yeah.

260
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,600
Aliens?
Yeah.

261
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,400
<i>Look,
even if they are real,</i>

262
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,800
They're sure as hell not coming
to earth and swiping people.

263
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,100
Hey, believe me.
We know.

264
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,000
My whole life
I've never found evidence

265
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,200
Of an honest-To-God
abduction.

266
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,100
It's all just
cranks and pranks.

267
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,500
Yeah, that's what
we thought.

268
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,600
But...we figured we'd at least
talk to the guy.

269
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,800
Hey, you ought to give
those purple nurples a shot.

270
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,000
So, what happened, curtis?

271
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,800
You won't believe me.
Nobody does.

272
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,700
Give us a chance.

273
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,400
<i>I do not want this
in the papers.</i>

274
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,000
Off the record, then.

275
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,200
I, uh...

276
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,900
I blacked out, and...

277
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,500
I lost time,

278
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,100
And when I woke up,
I don't know where I was.

279
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,300
Then what?

280
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,400
[ Voice cracking ]
they did tests on me.

281
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,200
And, uh...

282
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
They, uh...

283
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,900
They probed me.

284
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,200
They probed you?

285
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,100
Yeah, they probed me.

286
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:23,100
Again and a-- Again
and -- And again.

287
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,800
And again and again and again

288
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,300
And then one more time.

289
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,900
Yikes.

290
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,400
And that's not even
the worst of it.

291
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,700
How could it
get any worse?

292
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,300
Some alien made you
his bitch.

293
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,100
They...

294
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,900
They made me...

295
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,800
Slow dance!

296
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,700
You guys are
exaggerating again, huh?

297
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,700
No

298
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,800
Then this frat boy's
just nuts.

299
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,800
We're not so sure.

300
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,100
I'm telling you, dean,

301
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,300
This was made by some kind
of jet engine.

302
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,500
You mean some saucer-Shaped
jet engine?

303
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,700
What else could it be?

304
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,100
What the hell?
I don't know.

305
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,300
Seriously, dude --
What the hell?
I don't know.

306
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,400
I mean, first the hating.
Now this?

307
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,900
The timing alone --

308
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,400
There's got to be some kind
of connection.

309
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,500
You mean between the angry
spirit and the sexed-Up e.T.?

310
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,100
What could the connection
possibly be?

311
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,100
But what could we do?
So we just kept on digging.

312
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,400
So, you and this guy,
curtis --

313
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,100
You were in
the same house?
Yeah.

314
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,800
You heard what happened
to him, right?

315
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,800
Yeah, he says it was aliens,
but, you know, whatever.

316
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Look, man, I --

317
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,700
I know this all
has to be so hard.

318
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,800
Um, not so much.

319
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,200
But I want you to know...

320
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,400
I'm here for you.

321
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,300
You brave little soldier.

322
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,700
I acknowledge your pain.

323
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,700
Come here.

324
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,400
You're too precious
for this world.

325
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,000
I never said that!

326
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You're always saying
pansy stuff like that.

327
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,600
Well, um...

328
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,500
Yeah, uh, thanks.

329
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,200
Thanks for the hug,
but, uh, I'm okay.

330
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,300
Really.

331
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,600
To tell you the truth,

332
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,500
Whatever happened to curtis,
he had it coming.

333
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,300
Why is that?

334
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,600
He's our pledge master.

335
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,200
Put us through hell
this semester

336
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,000
And got off on it.

337
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,800
So now he knows
how we feel.

338
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,600
It's okay.

339
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,900
Still doesn't make a lick
of sense.

340
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,400
But, hey, at least
there's one connection.

341
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,600
Between what?

342
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,400
The victims.

343
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,600
The professor
and the frat guy --

344
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,200
They're both dicks.

345
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,700
That's a connection?

346
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,000
You got anything better
to go on, i'd love to hear it.

347
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,700
Where's my laptop?

348
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
I don't know.

349
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,100
Think about it.

350
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,200
A philandering professor
gets a dead girl.

351
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,900
A pledge master gets hazed.

352
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,100
I left it in here.

353
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,300
You obviously didn't.

354
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,000
I mean, these punishments --
They're almost poetic.

355
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
Actually, it'd be more like
a limerick, but still --

356
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,300
Okay, hilarious.
Ha ha.

357
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,500
Where'd you hide it?

358
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,000
What, your computer?
Yeah, where'd you hide it?

359
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,300
Why would I take
your computer?

360
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,700
Because no one else
could have.

361
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,300
We keep the door locked.
We never let any maids in.

362
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,700
Looks like you lost it,
poindexter.

363
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,800
Dude, you know something?
I put up with a lot from you.

364
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,400
What are you talking about?
I'm a joy to be around.

365
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,900
Yeah? Your dirty socks
in the sink,

366
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,500
Your food in the fridge.

367
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,300
What's wrong with my food?

368
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,400
It's not food anymore, dean!
It's darwinism.

369
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,600
All I ask from you,
the one thing,

370
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,300
Is that you don't mess
with my stuff!

371
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,100
You done?

372
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,100
You know, how would you feel
if I screwed with the impala?

373
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,500
It'd be the last thing
you ever did.

374
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,400
Did you take
his computer?

375
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,400
Serves him right,
but, no.

376
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,500
Well, I didn't lose it.

377
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,800
'Cause I don't
lose things.

378
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,900
Oh, that's right,
'cause he's mr. Perfect.

379
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,900
Okay, okay.

380
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,000
Why don't you just tell me
what happened next?

381
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,400
There was one more
victim.

382
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,900
Now, we didn't see this one
ourselves, either.

383
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,600
We kind of put it together
from the evidence.

384
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,700
But this guy -- He was
a research scientist.

385
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Animal testing.

386
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,300
Yeah, you know -- A dick,
which fits the pattern.

387
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,900
Hey.

388
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,700
Well, this ought
to be quick.

389
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Ok

390
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,800
That is just nasty.

391
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,400
Uh, yeah.

392
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,700
Mutilated?

393
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,400
Looks to me like something
was hungry.

394
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,300
They identify him yet?

395
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,100
Yeah. A research scientist
at the college.

396
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,300
Guess where his office was,
by the way.

397
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,700
Crawford hall,
same as the professor.

398
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,600
That's right where the frat boy
had his close encounter.

399
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,500
Yeah.

400
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,700
Hey, grab me that thing,
would you?

401
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,800
Thanks.

402
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,200
What is it?

403
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,000
Looks like a...

404
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,900
A belly scale?

405
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,200
A belly scale?
From what?

406
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,400
Uh...

407
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,700
An alligator?

408
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,800
An alligator in the sewer.

409
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,000
Come on.

410
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,600
What? Well, dean,
it's a classic urban legend.

411
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,600
A kid flushes a baby gator
down the toilet,

412
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
And it grows huge
in the tunnels.

413
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,200
But no one's ever
really found one.

414
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,500
They're not real.

415
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,800
Neither's alien abduction,

416
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,500
But something chomped
on this guy.

417
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,200
This couldn't get
any weirder.

418
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,300
Maybe we should get some help.
I'll call bobby.

419
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,200
Maybe he's run into something
like this before.

420
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,100
Oh, I'm sure he has.

421
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,700
Just your typical
haunted campus,

422
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,800
Alien abduction,
alligator-In-The-Sewer gig.

423
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,000
Yeah, it's simple.

424
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,600
We decided to search
the sewer anyway,

425
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,900
So we split up,
each taking one end of campus.

426
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,200
Did you find anything?

427
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,300
Yeah, I found something,
just not in the sewer.

428
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,900
Dean: son of a bitch!

429
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,400
Sam!

430
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,300
You think this is funny?

431
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,300
It depends. What?

432
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,500
The car!
What about the car?

433
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,000
You can't let the air
out of the tires.

434
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,300
You're gonna bend the rims!

435
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,700
Whoa, wait a minute.

436
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,300
I didn't go near your car.

437
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,000
Oh, yeah? Huh.

438
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,800
Then how'd I find this?

439
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,600
Hey, give me back my money.

440
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,900
Oh, no, no.

441
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,000
Consider it reparations
for, uh, emotional trauma.

442
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,400
Yeah, very funny.
Now, give it back.

443
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,600
No.

444
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,500
Dean,I have had it up
to here with you.

445
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,900
Yeah?
Right back at you!

446
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,300
Get off me!
Give it back!

447
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,700
Okay, I've heard enough.

448
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,800
You showed up
about an hour after that.

449
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,700
I'm surprised at you two.

450
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,900
I really am.

451
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,600
Sam, first off, dean
did not steal your computer.

452
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
But I --
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

453
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,600
And, dean, sam did not
touch your car.

454
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,100
[ Chuckling ] yeah.

455
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,300
And if you two bothered to pull
your heads out of your asses,

456
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,900
It all would have been
pretty clear.

457
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,700
What?
What you're dealing with.

458
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,600
Uh...

459
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,700
I got nothing.
Me neither.

460
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,100
You got a trickster
on your hands.

461
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
That's what I thought.

462
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,900
What?!
No, you didn't.

463
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,900
I got to tell you...

464
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,300
You guys were
the biggest clue.

465
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,400
What do you mean?

466
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,700
These things create
chaos and mischief

467
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,800
As easy as breathing,

468
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
And it's got you
so turned around

469
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,500
And at each other's throats,

470
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,900
You can't even think straight.

471
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,900
The laptop.
The tires.

472
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,600
It knows you're onto him,

473
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,700
And it's been playing you
like fiddles.

474
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,500
So, what is it --
Spirit, demon, what?

475
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,600
Well, more like demigods,
really.

476
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,500
There's loki in scandinavia.

477
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,900
There's anansi
in west africa.

478
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,100
Dozens of them.

479
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,200
They're immortal,

480
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,400
And they can create things
out of thin air,

481
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,700
Things as real as you and me.

482
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,100
Make them vanish just as quick.

483
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,700
You mean like an angry spirit
or an alien or an alligator.

484
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,600
The victims fit
the m.O., too.

485
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,400
Tricksters target
the high and the mighty,

486
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,200
Knock them down a peg,
usually with a sense of humor --

487
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,300
Deadly pranks,
things like that.

488
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,600
Bobby, what do these things
look like?

489
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,800
Lots of things,
but human, mostly.

490
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,400
And what human do we know

491
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,300
Who's been at ground zero
this whole time?

492
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,300
Janitor:
oh, that's a good one.

493
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,700
Come here

494
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,300
Could you eat?

495
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,500
I could eat.
Come on.

496
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,500
Something's missing.

497
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,900
That's better.

498
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,100
Mmm!

499
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,600
Sorry I'm dragging
a little ass today, boys.

500
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,100
Had quite the night
last night.

501
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,700
Lots of sex,
if you catch my drift.

502
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,800
Yeah, hard not to.
Listen, we won't be long.

503
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,100
We just need to check
a couple offices up on 3.

504
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,200
No problem.

505
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,600
Oh, damn.I, uh, forgot something
in the truck.

506
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,500
You know what?
I'll catch up with you guys.

507
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,200
Okay.

508
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,900
<i>Just 'cause he reads
the weekly world news</i>

509
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,200
Doesn't mean he's our guy.

510
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,100
You read it, too.

511
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,300
I'm telling you,
it's him.

512
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,700
Look, I just think we need
some hard proof.

513
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,600
That's all.

514
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,900
Another thing bobby mentioned
was that these suckers

515
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,300
Have a metabolism like
an insect, a real sweet tooth.

516
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,900
I didn't find
any candy bars or sugar.

517
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,500
Not even equal.
Probably missed something.

518
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,300
I don't miss things.

519
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,500
Oh, right,
'cause you're mr. Perfect.

520
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,300
What?

521
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,800
Are you really still
pissed at me

522
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,100
'Cause of what
the trickster did?

523
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,700
You been a tight ass long
before that trickster showed up.

524
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,600
Look, just...stay here,
keep an eye on the janitor.

525
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,100
I'll go to his place to see if I can find
any actual evidence

526
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,400
Before you go barging in
and staking the man!

527
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,200
Just wt till
I get back, okay?

528
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,600
Okay?
Okay!

529
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,500
Eh, screw this.

530
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,400
We've been waiting
for you, dean.

531
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,900
Y-Y-You guys aren't real.

532
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,000
Trust me, sugar,
it's gonna feel real.

533
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,800
Come on.
Let us give you a massage.

534
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,800
You know, I'm a --
I'm a sucker for a happy ending.

535
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,900
Really, I am, but...

536
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,400
I-I'm gonna have to pass.

537
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,100
Janitor:
they're a peace offering.

538
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,500
<i>I know what you
and your brother do.</i>

539
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,700
I've been around a while.
Run into your kind before.

540
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,000
Well,
then you know that i...

541
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,900
Can't let you just
keep hurting people.

542
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,300
Come on!

543
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,400
Those people got
what was coming to them.

544
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Hoisted on their own
petards.

545
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,700
But you and sam --
I like you.

546
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,200
I do.

547
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,900
So treat yourself...

548
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,600
Long as you want.

549
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,500
Just long enough for me
to move on to the next town.

550
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,300
Yeah, I don't think
I can let you do that.

551
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,800
I don't want to hurt you.

552
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,800
And you know that I can.

553
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,300
Look, man, I --
I got to tell you,

554
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,400
I dig your style,
all right?

555
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,300
I mean [chuckles]
I do. I mean

556
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,200
And the slow-Dancing
alien --

557
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,300
One of my personal
favorites.
Yeah.

558
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,500
But, uh,
I can't let you go.

559
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,500
Too bad.

560
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,800
Like I said, I like you.

561
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,500
Sam was right.

562
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,400
You shouldn't have
come alone.

563
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,400
Well, I'll agree
with you there.

564
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,600
That fight you guys
had outside --

565
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,200
That was a trick?

566
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,100
Hmm.

567
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,200
Not bad.

568
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,800
But you want to see
a real trick?

569
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,800
Ohh!

570
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,500
Aah!

571
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,200
Ohh!

572
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,800
Ohh!

573
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,800
Ha!

574
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,100
Nice toss, ladies!

575
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Dean...

576
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,000
Dean, dean, dean.

577
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,100
I did not want to have
to do this.

578
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,900
Me neither.

579
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,300
You guys okay?

580
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,700
Yeah.

581
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
I guess.

582
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,400
All I got to say...

583
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,900
He had style.

584
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,500
Ohh.

585
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,900
Bobby, thanks a lot.

586
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,000
Hey, save it!

587
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,400
Let's just get the hell
out of dodge

588
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,900
Before somebody
finds that body.

589
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,800
Yeah

590
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,100
Look, dean, um...

591
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,900
I just want to say
that I'm, uh...

592
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,000
Um...

593
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,200
Hey.

594
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,700
Me too.

595
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,500
You guys are breaking
my heart.

596
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,200
Could we please
just leave?
