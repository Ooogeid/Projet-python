1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:02,934
Why are we even here?
'cause you're following dad's orders

2
00:00:03,059 --> 00:00:05,880
like a good little soldier? Are you
that desperate for his approval?

3
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:08,361
- This isn't you talking.
- That's the difference between us.

4
00:00:08,486 --> 00:00:11,165
I have a mind of my own.
I'm not pathetic like you.

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,608
- Before dad died, he told me something.
- He said that I might have to kill you.

6
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:16,349
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

7
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,601
- I don't know.
- We're talking about the colt, right?

8
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,764
If you are still set on the insane task
of killing the devil,

9
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:24,440
- this is how we do it.
- You guys are larping, aren't you?

10
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,317
- Excuse me?
- Live-action role-playing.

11
00:00:26,485 --> 00:00:27,818
- You're fans.
- Fans?

12
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,568
- "Supernatural" by Carver Edlund.
- His name's Chuck Shurley.

13
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:33,066
- And he's a genius.
- I'm Dean. This is Sam.

14
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:34,950
The Dean and Sam
you've been writing about.

15
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,453
I write things and then they
come to life. Obviously I'm a god.

16
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:38,975
He's a prophet of the lord.

17
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,109
- You're...
- Carver Edlund, yeah.

18
00:00:41,234 --> 00:00:42,027
Hi, Becky.

19
00:00:42,152 --> 00:00:43,918
I am Your number-one fan.

20
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,128
But I know that "Supernatural"
is just a book, okay?

21
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,339
- Becky, it's all real.
- I knew it!

22
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,966
- You okay, lady?
- Sam is it really you?

23
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,763
And you're so firm.

24
00:01:18,014 --> 00:01:19,203
Dean. Come on!

25
00:01:25,277 --> 00:01:25,987
Chuck!

26
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,253
There you are.

27
00:01:27,566 --> 00:01:28,212
Guys.

28
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:30,318
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

29
00:01:30,443 --> 00:01:33,357
You know, just,
I was kind of hangin'.

30
00:01:33,482 --> 00:01:35,636
- What are you guys doing here?
- You told us to come.

31
00:01:36,581 --> 00:01:37,471
No, I didn't.

32
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,140
Yeah, you did.
You texted me...

33
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,321
This address, "life-or-death situation".
Any of this ringing a bell?

34
00:01:42,446 --> 00:01:45,187
- No, I didn't send you a text.
- We drove all night.

35
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,648
I'm sorry.
I don't understand what could...

36
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,984
- Oh, no.
- What?

37
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:53,154
Sam! You made it!

38
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:58,367
Becky, right?

39
00:02:00,392 --> 00:02:01,615
You remembered.

40
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,169
You've been thinking about me.

41
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:07,090
It's okay.

42
00:02:07,215 --> 00:02:09,129
I can't get you
out of my head, either.

43
00:02:09,524 --> 00:02:10,701
Did you take my phone?

44
00:02:11,306 --> 00:02:13,280
I just borrowed it.
From your pants.

45
00:02:13,875 --> 00:02:15,050
- Becky.
- What?

46
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,635
They're gonna want to see it.

47
00:02:16,954 --> 00:02:17,809
See what?

48
00:02:17,934 --> 00:02:21,348
Oh, my god. I love it
when they talk at the same time!

49
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,516
Hey, Chuck!

50
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:24,318
Come on, pal. It's showtime.

51
00:02:25,785 --> 00:02:27,646
Guys, I'm sorry.

52
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:30,441
For everything.

53
00:02:45,852 --> 00:02:48,233
Hey, Dean!
Lookin' good!

54
00:02:48,358 --> 00:02:49,865
Who the hell are you?

55
00:02:50,786 --> 00:02:52,549
I'm Dean, too.

56
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:04,039
It's Sam and Dean.
I'm in trouble now.

57
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:05,723
Have fun, you two.

58
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:11,482
What?

59
00:03:22,122 --> 00:03:24,122
Becky, what is this?

60
00:03:24,516 --> 00:03:26,345
It's awesome!

61
00:03:26,595 --> 00:03:27,914
A "Supernatural" convention.

62
00:03:28,254 --> 00:03:29,290
The first ever.

63
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,014
= 509 =

64
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,975
Supernatural Team

65
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:48,427


66
00:03:52,228 --> 00:03:55,110
Welcome to the first annual
"Supernatural" convention.

67
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:58,834
At 3:45 in the magnolia room,

68
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,984
we have the panel
"Frightened little boy:

69
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,761
The secret life of Dean."

70
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,485
And at 4:30, there's the homoerotic
subtext of "Supernatural".

71
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:11,917
And, of course, the big hunt
starts at 7:00 P.M. Sharp.

72
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,942
But... but right now...

73
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:19,771
Right now I'd like to introduce
the man himself.

74
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:24,138
The creator and the writer
of the "Supernatural" books...

75
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,724
The one, the only...

76
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,654
Carver Edlund!

77
00:04:44,222 --> 00:04:46,669
Okay, good.
This isn't nearly as awkward as I...

78
00:04:48,077 --> 00:04:49,919
It's a little dry mouth.

79
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:12,226
So, I guess, uh...

80
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:14,438
Questions?

81
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:19,428
- You?
- Hey, Mr. Edlund.

82
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:20,527
Big fan.

83
00:05:21,994 --> 00:05:23,178
I was just wondering...

84
00:05:23,303 --> 00:05:25,994
Where'd you come up
with Sam and Dean in the first place?

85
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,122
It just... came to me.

86
00:05:36,241 --> 00:05:37,520
Yeah, the...

87
00:05:38,412 --> 00:05:39,333
Hook man.

88
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,931
Why, in every fight scene,
Sam and Dean are having

89
00:05:44,056 --> 00:05:46,178
their gun or knife knocked away
by the bad guy?

90
00:05:47,061 --> 00:05:49,431
Why don't they keep it
on some kind of bungee?

91
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,147
- Yeah, I really don't know.
- Yeah, follow-up...

92
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:57,226
Why can't Sam and Dean
be telling that ruby is evil?

93
00:05:57,351 --> 00:06:01,527
I mean, she is clearly manipulating Sam
into some kind of moral lapse.

94
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,227
It's obvious, nein?

95
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,073
If you don't like the books,
don't read 'em, fritz!

96
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,351
So, next question.

97
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:15,561
Yeah, you.

98
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:18,614
Yeah, at the end of the last book,
Dean goes to hell.

99
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:20,754
So, what happens next?

100
00:06:21,874 --> 00:06:25,259
Well, there lies
an announcement, actually.

101
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:28,804
You're all gonna find out.

102
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:32,725
Thanks to a wealthy
scandinavian investor...

103
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:36,311
We're gonna start publishing again.

104
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:44,945
Sweet lord, yes!

105
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:55,907
I got you a yellow-eyed cooler.

106
00:06:57,525 --> 00:06:59,218
- Thanks, Chuck.
- Sure.

107
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,253
So, Becky...

108
00:07:03,495 --> 00:07:05,565
I was wondering,
are you doing anyth...

109
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,133
Hi, Sam!

110
00:07:08,723 --> 00:07:09,743
Excuse us!

111
00:07:09,868 --> 00:07:12,347
In case you haven't noticed,
our plates are kind of full.

112
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,142
Okay? Finding The Colt,
hunting the devil.

113
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,013
We don't have time for this crap!

114
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,147
- I didn't call you.
- He means the books, Chuck.

115
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:21,976
Why are you publishing more books?

116
00:07:22,924 --> 00:07:24,121
For food and shelter?

117
00:07:24,246 --> 00:07:26,487
Who gave you the rights
to our life story?

118
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,614
An archangel.
And I didn't want it.

119
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,491
Deal's off, okay?
No more books.

120
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,576
Our lives are not
for public consumption.

121
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:39,416
Becky, would you excuse us
for just a second?

122
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:44,955
Do you guys know
what I do for a living?

123
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,127
- Yeah, Chuck, we know.
- Then, could you tell me?

124
00:07:47,252 --> 00:07:49,259
- 'cause I don't.
- I'm not a good writer,

125
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,220
I've got no marketable skills,

126
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:55,160
I'm not some hero who can just
hit the road and fight monsters, okay?

127
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:58,191
Until the world ends,
I got to live, all right?

128
00:07:58,316 --> 00:08:00,187
And the "Supernatural" books
are all I've got.

129
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:02,189
What else do you want me to do?

130
00:08:06,494 --> 00:08:08,195
No. Guys! Wait!

131
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,373
Hey, you okay?

132
00:08:13,498 --> 00:08:15,179
- I think so.
- What happened?

133
00:08:15,304 --> 00:08:16,411
I saw a ghost.

134
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,038
A ghost? Ma'am, could you tell us
what it looked like?

135
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:21,260
Why don't you leave this
to the grown-ups, pal?

136
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:23,794
A woman.
She was in an old-fashioned dress.

137
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,178
Really old,
like a schoolmarm or something.

138
00:08:27,303 --> 00:08:28,743
Did she say something to you?

139
00:08:30,165 --> 00:08:34,555
Gather close, everybody,
for a terrifying tale of terror!

140
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:37,238
I saw a ghost.

141
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:41,857
None other than the ghost
of Leticia Gore herself!

142
00:08:43,264 --> 00:08:45,691
I was on the third floor when I...

143
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,423
The larping's started.

144
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:51,709
- What is that again?
- Live-action role-playing.

145
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:54,549
It's a game.
The convention puts it on.

146
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,487
... terror gripping my heart
with its icy fingers...

147
00:08:58,723 --> 00:08:59,868
"Dad's journal...

148
00:08:59,993 --> 00:09:02,355
Dear Sam and Dean,
this hotel is haunted.

149
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,126
You must hunt down the ghost.

150
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:07,296
Interview witnesses, discover clues,
and find the bones.

151
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:11,675
First team to do so
wins a $50 gift card to Sizzler.

152
00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:13,211
Love, dad."

153
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,013
You guys are so gonna win.

154
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,144
Why, yes,
agents Lennon and McCartney,

155
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:24,453
As manager
of this fine establishment,

156
00:09:24,578 --> 00:09:28,400
I can assure you that
it is indeed haunted.

157
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:33,651
This building was once an orphanage
run by mean, old Leticia Gore.

158
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,691
100 years ago this very night,

159
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:42,831
Miss Gore went insane and butchered
four little boys before killing herself.

160
00:09:43,704 --> 00:09:45,046
Now folks say

161
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:48,295
that the souls of those poor
little boys are trapped here

162
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:51,924
and that the evil spirit
of Miss Gore punishes them

163
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,329
to this... very... day.

164
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,658
Well, that's just about
all the community theater I can take.

165
00:09:59,356 --> 00:10:01,422
Yeah, this cannot get any weirder.

166
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:02,792
Dad said...

167
00:10:03,095 --> 00:10:04,603
He said I may have to kill you.

168
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:07,898
- Kill me?
- What the hell does that mean?

169
00:10:08,023 --> 00:10:09,608
I don't know.

170
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,061
I need a drink.

171
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:21,078
The EMF's going nuts.

172
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,050
I'm mean, old Leticia Gore.

173
00:10:32,175 --> 00:10:34,466
They buried me in the basement.

174
00:10:39,028 --> 00:10:40,331
You got me.

175
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,837
You're supposed to vanish.

176
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:44,393
How am I supposed to vanish?

177
00:10:46,357 --> 00:10:48,408
Yeah, okay, Dean.
We'll see you in five.

178
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:50,737
Hey, but seriously, dude,
don't eat my skittles.

179
00:10:50,862 --> 00:10:51,895
Help us.

180
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,323
Help us. Miss Gore
won't let us have any fun.

181
00:10:59,566 --> 00:11:01,737
This is part of the game, right?

182
00:11:03,711 --> 00:11:05,342
Holy mother of crap!

183
00:11:15,705 --> 00:11:17,843
That... was...

184
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:28,520
Naughty!

185
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:29,741
Naughty! Naughty!

186
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:42,291


187
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,132
- How you doin'?
- Busy.

188
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:02,346
You sure look lovely tonight,
especially for a dead chick.

189
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,845
Buddy, I have heard
that line 17 times tonight, okay?

190
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,762
And all from dudes
wearing MacGyver jackets.

191
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:15,300
But you seem different.

192
00:12:15,425 --> 00:12:17,527
- How so?
- Well, you don't seem scared of women.

193
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:20,800
For the last time,
I'm not making this up, okay?

194
00:12:20,925 --> 00:12:23,661
She's upstairs.
A real, live, dead ghost!

195
00:12:23,913 --> 00:12:24,777
Excuse me.

196
00:12:24,902 --> 00:12:26,577
I'm sure it was just onen
of the actors.

197
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:28,709
Who beat the crap out of me
and then vanished?

198
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:29,859
You saw something?

199
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:31,665
Look, this isn't part
of the game, jerk.

200
00:12:32,035 --> 00:12:34,423
Tim, I'm getting out of here,
and you should do the same.

201
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:38,366
- Alex, wait. I...
- Hey, come back!

202
00:12:40,168 --> 00:12:41,537
What do you think?

203
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:44,050
I don't think that guy's
a good enough actor to be acting.

204
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,456
Why, yes,
agents Jagger and Richards,

205
00:12:47,956 --> 00:12:50,177
as the manager
of this fine establishment,

206
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,825
I can assure you
it is indeed haunted.

207
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:57,700
The building was once an orphanage
run by mean, old Leticia Gore.

208
00:12:59,463 --> 00:13:01,673
Excuse us.
Mind if we ask you a few questions?

209
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:03,716
I don't have time
to play "Star Wars," guys.

210
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:05,535
Go ask the guy in the ascot.

211
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:08,733
Actually, we...

212
00:13:09,314 --> 00:13:10,729
Really want to talk toyou.

213
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,668
You guys are really into this.

214
00:13:14,013 --> 00:13:15,085
You have no idea.

215
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:18,356
- What do you want to know?
- All this stuff they're saying...

216
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:20,219
Place being haunted, Leticia Gore.

217
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:21,864
Any truth to it?

218
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,762
We generally don't like to publicize
this to normal people.

219
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,918
But in 1909, this place was called
Gore orphanage.

220
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:34,938
Miss Gore killed four boys
with a butcher knife then offed herself.

221
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,744
And is tonight really
the anniversary?

222
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:39,237
Yep. Guess your convention folks
wanted authenticity.

223
00:13:41,592 --> 00:13:43,987
- There been any sightings?
- Over the years, yeah.

224
00:13:44,382 --> 00:13:49,077
A few maids have quit,
saying they heard the boys or saw them.

225
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,931
A Janitor even saw Miss Gore once.

226
00:13:51,056 --> 00:13:52,831
Where did Miss Gore
carve up the kids?

227
00:13:53,142 --> 00:13:56,251
Look, I don't want you stomping
all over the joint.

228
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,626
A lot of this place
is off-limits to nerds.

229
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:07,452
The attic.

230
00:14:33,016 --> 00:14:34,610
The EMF's going nuts.

231
00:14:35,897 --> 00:14:36,871
Great.

232
00:14:38,082 --> 00:14:40,085
So, we got a real ghost,
and a bunch of dudes,

233
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,055
pretending to be us, poking at it.

234
00:14:42,797 --> 00:14:44,174
No way this ends well.

235
00:14:45,771 --> 00:14:47,260
You know what?
Serves them right.

236
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,000
Well, I'm just saying.

237
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:07,680
It's got to be
around here someplace.

238
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,982
I don't know, man.
No one else is looking for the attic.

239
00:15:11,219 --> 00:15:13,174
Okay, all right, dude.

240
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:17,081
One, stay in character, all right?
If it's just me, I look stupid.

241
00:15:17,637 --> 00:15:20,111
And two,
you heard the guy downstairs.

242
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,762
I think this is part of the game.

243
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:24,183
Help us.

244
00:15:26,235 --> 00:15:27,300
Oh, my god!

245
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:30,845
That makeup is amazing.

246
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,013
Amateur.

247
00:15:32,354 --> 00:15:34,683
Stay... in... character.

248
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:37,269
Sorry.
Sorry.

249
00:15:37,693 --> 00:15:40,438
Help us.
Miss Gore won't let us have any fun.

250
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,232
Where's the body buried, kid?

251
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,026
We'll light her up nice and toasty.

252
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:58,916
Wow. Fast runner.

253
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:01,061
Dude.

254
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:03,995
Check this out.

255
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,593
Oh, that is creepy.

256
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,678
Must've been
what he was trying to tell us.

257
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,315
Gee, you think, Sammy?

258
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,947
Okay, this is the coolest game ever.

259
00:16:34,065 --> 00:16:34,981
Yes.

260
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:01,506
My mommy loves me.

261
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:07,686
I said my mommy loves me.

262
00:17:10,149 --> 00:17:11,265
I'm sure she does.

263
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,234
My mommy loves me this much.

264
00:17:44,572 --> 00:17:45,563
Awesome.

265
00:17:46,477 --> 00:17:47,804
All right, so...

266
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:50,479
That was a guy
with the county historical society.

267
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:51,297
And?

268
00:17:51,422 --> 00:17:53,664
Not only did Leticia Gore
butcher four boys,

269
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:55,615
but one of them was her own son.

270
00:17:56,112 --> 00:17:57,367
- Her son?
- Yeah.

271
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,370
According to the police at the time,
she scalped the poor kid.

272
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,914
Oh, that's it. I'm gonna deep-fry
this bitch extra-crispy.

273
00:18:03,371 --> 00:18:04,739
Dude say where she was buried?

274
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:05,985
He doesn't know.

275
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,669
Check it out.

276
00:18:08,037 --> 00:18:11,326
There's the orphanage,
here's the carriage house.

277
00:18:11,451 --> 00:18:13,591
And right there, cemetery.

278
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:16,327
You think that's
where Leticia's planted?

279
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:18,248
It's worth a shot.

280
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,142
Hey, do you mind?

281
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,394
It's real. A century old, at least.
And he's right.

282
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:27,258
- There is a cemetery on the grounds.
- Where'd you get that?

283
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,524
It's called a game, pal.

284
00:18:29,928 --> 00:18:31,420
It ain't called "charity."

285
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:32,855
Give me the map, chuckles.

286
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:35,073
You're the chuckles...

287
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:36,281
Chuckles.

288
00:18:36,827 --> 00:18:39,701
Besides,
Dean don't listen to nobody.

289
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,828
Dean... cool it.

290
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:43,450
Dean.

291
00:18:43,977 --> 00:18:44,661
What?

292
00:18:45,075 --> 00:18:46,331
They're friggin' annoying.

293
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,752
Look, guys, we all want
to find the bones, right?

294
00:18:49,214 --> 00:18:51,880
We just thought it would go faster
if we all work together.

295
00:18:55,187 --> 00:18:58,003
We get the Sizzler gift card.

296
00:18:58,717 --> 00:19:00,679
- Fine.
- And we get to be Sam and Dean.

297
00:19:03,003 --> 00:19:03,806
Fine.

298
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:05,569
Yes.

299
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,898
Rufus, Bobby would you hurry it up?

300
00:19:10,938 --> 00:19:11,767
You okay?

301
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,108
I'm trying to be.

302
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,345
So, where were we?

303
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,582
Dr. Ellicott
had just zapped your brain.

304
00:19:18,977 --> 00:19:20,029
Right. Got it.

305
00:19:21,582 --> 00:19:23,600
Why are we even here, Dean?

306
00:19:23,725 --> 00:19:27,008
Do you just follow in dad's footsteps
like a good, little soldier?

307
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,014
Are you that desperate for approval?

308
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:32,170
- This isn't you talking.
- That's the difference between us.

309
00:19:32,295 --> 00:19:34,506
I got a mind of my own.
I'm not pathetic.

310
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,096
So, what are you gonna do, Sam?

311
00:19:36,221 --> 00:19:37,565
You gonna kill me?

312
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,735
I am so sick of you telling me
what to do!

313
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,763
Oh, you know what?
That... that's it.

314
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:42,912
That is it.

315
00:19:43,037 --> 00:19:44,808
What's wrong, Bobby?

316
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:48,965
I'm not Bobby, okay?

317
00:19:49,465 --> 00:19:50,833
You're not Sam.

318
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,360
You're not Dean!
What is wrong with you?

319
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:56,400
Why in the hell would you choose
to be these guys?

320
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:59,155
Because we're fans, like you.

321
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,193
No.
I am not a fan, okay?

322
00:20:02,796 --> 00:20:03,796
Not fans.

323
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,580
In fact, I think
that the Dean and Sam story sucks!

324
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,170
It is not fun,
it's not entertaining.

325
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:12,845
It is a river of crap

326
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,672
that would send most people
howling to the nuthouse!

327
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,450
So, listen to me.

328
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,444
Their pain
is not for your amusement.

329
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:21,803
Do you think they enjoy
being treated like...

330
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,846
Circus freaks?

331
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,439
I don't think they care,

332
00:20:26,564 --> 00:20:29,227
because
they're fictional characters.

333
00:20:29,593 --> 00:20:30,593
They care.

334
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:32,614
Believe me.

335
00:20:33,078 --> 00:20:34,378
They care a lot.

336
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:43,867
He takes the story really seriously.

337
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,395
- Found the four boys.
- And here's Leticia Gore.

338
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,406
What are you doing?

339
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,614
We're looking for bones.

340
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,159
They gotta be around here.

341
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,786
Generally bones

342
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,439
are in the ground.

343
00:21:32,327 --> 00:21:33,427
I know that.

344
00:21:33,783 --> 00:21:34,833
I'm just...

345
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:37,996
Wait. Hold on.

346
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,007
- You serious?
- Deadly.

347
00:21:41,924 --> 00:21:43,968
We're not really digging up graves.

348
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,803
We're just playing the game, so...

349
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,514
Trust us.
You want to win the game, right?

350
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,270
That's not a plastic skeleton.

351
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:37,146
- That's a skeleton.
- You just dug up a real grave.

352
00:22:43,731 --> 00:22:44,737
You are nuts.

353
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,489
You wanted to be hunters.

354
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,491
Hunters aren't real, man.
This isn't real.

355
00:22:49,616 --> 00:22:50,644
My God.

356
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,829
You have seriously
lost your grip on this...

357
00:22:55,097 --> 00:22:56,097
What?

358
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,668
Naughty! Naughty! Naughty!

359
00:23:09,152 --> 00:23:10,202
Oh, my God!

360
00:23:10,327 --> 00:23:12,813
Naughty! Naughty! Naughty!

361
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:34,769
Real enough for you?

362
00:23:42,969 --> 00:23:43,713


363
00:23:53,504 --> 00:23:54,554
That was...

364
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,518
- Really...
- Awful, right?

365
00:23:58,173 --> 00:23:59,173
Exactly.

366
00:24:03,403 --> 00:24:04,603
Round's on us.

367
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:06,349
See you.

368
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,032
How did you know how to do all that?

369
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:18,354
We read the books.

370
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,799
Good luck
with the Supernatural books.

371
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,542
And screw you very much.

372
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,370
Fans of yours?

373
00:24:35,671 --> 00:24:36,721
I'd say no.

374
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,840
- That's weird.
- Definitely.

375
00:24:52,371 --> 00:24:54,621
- Anything?
- Every exit's locked.

376
00:24:54,746 --> 00:24:56,783
- Almost like...
- Something's keeping us in?

377
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,450
This is bad.

378
00:24:58,575 --> 00:25:00,175
Gee, you think, Sammy?

379
00:25:03,976 --> 00:25:06,266
- Don't go in there!
- Get downstairs, okay?

380
00:25:06,391 --> 00:25:07,391
Go. Go!

381
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,342
Why'd you do that?

382
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:14,470
Why did you send my mommy away?

383
00:25:15,325 --> 00:25:17,348
Because of the high-and-tight
she gave you?

384
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,242
How 'bout some thanks?

385
00:25:20,945 --> 00:25:24,063
I'm just saying a little gratitude
might be nice once in a while.

386
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,065
My mommy didn't do this to me.

387
00:25:26,662 --> 00:25:27,662
What?

388
00:25:28,452 --> 00:25:29,527
Then, who did?

389
00:25:42,822 --> 00:25:43,972
How original.

390
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:47,343
Supernatural
bringing you more creepy children.

391
00:25:48,078 --> 00:25:51,132
- Sigh.
- Miss Gore wouldn't let us have fun.

392
00:25:51,438 --> 00:25:53,638
You look nothing like real ghosts.

393
00:25:54,461 --> 00:25:56,721
- Just telling you.
- But Miss Gore's gone,

394
00:25:57,268 --> 00:26:00,500
And now,
we can have all kinds of fun.

395
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,700
Well, guys,
I guess we're out of time.

396
00:26:25,387 --> 00:26:27,418
Thank you
for your incredibly probing

397
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,620
and rigorous questions,

398
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:31,088
Have a good...

399
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:34,842
What?! Holy crap!

400
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,166
You gotta keep everyone safe
in here, Chuck.

401
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:41,149
- This is life-or-death.
- For how long?

402
00:26:41,274 --> 00:26:43,935
- As long as it takes.
- How am I supposed to do that?

403
00:26:46,578 --> 00:26:47,978
I don't know, man.

404
00:26:48,953 --> 00:26:50,003
Just do it.

405
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,116
Good news.

406
00:26:58,405 --> 00:27:01,155
I got much more to tell you,
I guess....

407
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:02,954
Awesome.

408
00:27:04,454 --> 00:27:06,905
- Buddy, I got work to do.
- You wanna see this, trust me.

409
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,642
It's gonna be a hell of a show

410
00:27:09,743 --> 00:27:11,393
Here we go, here we go.

411
00:27:12,738 --> 00:27:15,638
Certainly
there are a lot of nice witches, too.

412
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,666
What does the future hold
for Sam and Dean?

413
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,217
How do you feel about angels?

414
00:27:25,969 --> 00:27:28,896
Let me tell you,
they're not as lame as you think.

415
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:32,524
New theory.

416
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,680
Legends on Leticia
are ass-backwards.

417
00:27:35,705 --> 00:27:37,655
Let's say those three orphans

418
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:41,390
- were playing cowboys and Indians.
- Larping as cowboys and Indians.

419
00:27:41,515 --> 00:27:45,509
Whatever... Let's say they scalped
Leticia's son and killed him.

420
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:47,820
Mom catches them in the act,
flips out,

421
00:27:47,945 --> 00:27:49,939
slices them and dices herself.

422
00:27:50,064 --> 00:27:52,420
It means we got
3 bloodthirsty brats in the building.

423
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,505
Leticia was keeping them
under control.

424
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,203
- Until we took her out.
- Smooth move on our part.

425
00:27:57,328 --> 00:27:59,593
We got to go
and torch the kids' bones.

426
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,060
How?

427
00:28:01,185 --> 00:28:03,681
We're trapped.
We don't even have our guns.

428
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:07,226
The ghosts are running this joint,
and they are only scared of one thing.

429
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,062
Exactly.

430
00:28:10,484 --> 00:28:13,858
- You want me to do what?
- You're an actress? We want you to act.

431
00:28:14,353 --> 00:28:16,253
I work at Hooters in Toledo.

432
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:20,031
- You can forget it.
- You'll be safe. We promise.

433
00:28:20,751 --> 00:28:22,192
This is really important.

434
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:24,745
We want to help.

435
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,788
Give her the puppy-dog thing.

436
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:27,913
Guys, no.

437
00:28:28,251 --> 00:28:30,708
- Why not?
- Because this isn't make-believe.

438
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,418
We know, we're not nuts.

439
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:34,516
We're freakin' terrified.

440
00:28:34,641 --> 00:28:37,641
But if all these people
are seriously in trouble,

441
00:28:38,061 --> 00:28:39,967
- we got to do something.
- Why?

442
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,135
Because...

443
00:28:41,525 --> 00:28:43,054
That's what Sam and Dean would do.

444
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:50,149
There's really no such thing
as a Croatoan virus

445
00:28:50,274 --> 00:28:52,203
for... down there.

446
00:28:53,855 --> 00:28:55,232
You should see a doctor.

447
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,820
I don't want to do this.

448
00:29:11,075 --> 00:29:13,426
I'm right here, sweetheart.
I got your back.

449
00:29:14,141 --> 00:29:16,091
Trust me, this is gonna work.

450
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:21,209
Boys!

451
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,263
Come here, this instant!

452
00:29:40,328 --> 00:29:41,987
You come when I call you!

453
00:29:44,995 --> 00:29:46,555
Do you understand me?!

454
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,680
Miss Gore?

455
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:55,289
Push!

456
00:30:01,011 --> 00:30:02,061
You boys...

457
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:05,190
Have been very naughty.

458
00:30:07,862 --> 00:30:09,562
Now, you open the doors.

459
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:11,892
Open the doors right now!

460
00:30:17,157 --> 00:30:18,207
Go, go, go!

461
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,697
You're very naughty.

462
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:25,822
You hear me?

463
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,706
Naughty, naughty, naughty.

464
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,156
Run.

465
00:31:13,975 --> 00:31:14,538


466
00:31:24,236 --> 00:31:25,457
Oh, my God.

467
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:29,078
Supernatural makes digging graves

468
00:31:29,206 --> 00:31:30,356
seem so easy.

469
00:31:33,544 --> 00:31:34,894
It's not, though.

470
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:36,268
I'm gonna throw up.

471
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:39,914
No, you're not.

472
00:32:00,826 --> 00:32:01,826
Thanks.

473
00:32:06,106 --> 00:32:08,050
Let's see... What else?

474
00:32:09,912 --> 00:32:12,462
I fell in love
for the first time at 16.

475
00:32:13,429 --> 00:32:15,329
Lost my virginity, actually.

476
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,144
But then she went around
telling everybody it didn't count, so...

477
00:32:19,851 --> 00:32:22,093
That's kinda... funny.

478
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,090
Excuse me!

479
00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:26,839
You can't leave.

480
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,128
Please, sir.

481
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,240
Don't!

482
00:32:59,301 --> 00:33:01,301
I said no one leaves, damn it!

483
00:33:01,426 --> 00:33:03,126
Somebody salt this door!

484
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:22,522
How come Dean can always light
this stupid thing on the first try?!

485
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:25,002
Come on!

486
00:34:10,112 --> 00:34:11,862
Maybe that guy was right.

487
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,510
We should put these things
on a bungee.

488
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,140


489
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:30,999
And I got to hand it to you, guys.

490
00:34:31,472 --> 00:34:33,426
You really saved our asses
back there.

491
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,532
Thanks.

492
00:34:39,106 --> 00:34:40,703
I don't even know your names.

493
00:34:41,688 --> 00:34:43,747
I'm Barnes, this is Damien.

494
00:34:44,572 --> 00:34:45,722
What's yours?

495
00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:49,825
Dean.

496
00:34:50,301 --> 00:34:51,501
The real Dean.

497
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,807
- Me too!
- Get out of here, Dean.

498
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:06,881
Well, anyway, thanks.

499
00:35:08,121 --> 00:35:09,121
Really.

500
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:14,019
You're wrong, you know.

501
00:35:15,623 --> 00:35:17,156
- Sorry?
- About Supernatural.

502
00:35:17,937 --> 00:35:18,987
No offense,

503
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,702
but I'm not sure
you get what the story's about.

504
00:35:23,475 --> 00:35:24,525
Is that so?

505
00:35:25,454 --> 00:35:26,604
In real life,

506
00:35:27,832 --> 00:35:29,632
he sells stereo equipment,

507
00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:32,209
I fix copiers.

508
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:34,642
Our lives suck.

509
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:38,935
But to be Sam and Dean...

510
00:35:41,148 --> 00:35:42,848
To wake up every morning

511
00:35:42,993 --> 00:35:44,475
and save the world...

512
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,994
To have a brother
who would die for you...

513
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,400
Who wouldn't want that?

514
00:35:55,192 --> 00:35:56,792
Maybe you got a point.

515
00:36:01,956 --> 00:36:03,869
You don't make
a bad team yourselves.

516
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,797
How do you know each other?

517
00:36:08,325 --> 00:36:09,525
We met online.

518
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:11,369
Supernatural chat room.

519
00:36:14,637 --> 00:36:17,758
Must be nice to get out of your parents'
basement and make some friends.

520
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:19,626
We're more than friends.

521
00:36:22,545 --> 00:36:23,795
We're partners.

522
00:36:34,376 --> 00:36:35,609
Howdy, partners.

523
00:36:36,297 --> 00:36:37,297
Howdy.

524
00:36:42,144 --> 00:36:43,244
Look, Sam...

525
00:36:43,594 --> 00:36:44,994
I'm not gonna lie.

526
00:36:45,424 --> 00:36:48,764
We had undeniable chemistry.

527
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:52,876
But like a monkey on the sun,
it was too hot to live.

528
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,712
It can't go on.

529
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,332
Chuck and I...

530
00:36:58,748 --> 00:37:00,248
We found each other.

531
00:37:00,856 --> 00:37:02,606
My yin to his proud yang.

532
00:37:03,904 --> 00:37:07,137
And, well, the heart wants
what the heart wants.

533
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:11,349
I am so, so sorry.

534
00:37:13,415 --> 00:37:14,415
Yeah, Sam.

535
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,575
You know, sorry.

536
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,199
Will you be all right?

537
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:29,288
Honestly, I don't know.

538
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:32,030
I'll just have to...

539
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,376
To find a way to keep living,

540
00:37:34,977 --> 00:37:35,977
I guess.

541
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:37,522
God bless you.

542
00:37:42,908 --> 00:37:44,386
If you wanna publish more books,

543
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:46,430
I guess that's okay with us.

544
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,225
- Really?
- No. We have guns and we'll find you.

545
00:37:52,516 --> 00:37:53,716
No more books.

546
00:37:54,352 --> 00:37:55,355
See you.

547
00:37:57,421 --> 00:37:59,067
Sam! Wait!
One more thing!

548
00:38:01,101 --> 00:38:03,476
In chapter 33 of Supernatural:
Time is on my side

549
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:06,283
there was that girl Bela,
she was British and a cat burglar.

550
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,645
- I know.
- She stole the colt from you,

551
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,861
and she said
she gave it to Lilith, remember?

552
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,041
You know she lied?
She never really gave it to Lilith.

553
00:38:15,224 --> 00:38:16,960
- What?
- Didn't you read the book?

554
00:38:17,876 --> 00:38:20,005
There was this scene
where Bela gives the colt

555
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,928
to a demon named Crowley,
Lilith's right-hand man.

556
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:25,403
- I think her lover, too.
- Crowley?

557
00:38:26,286 --> 00:38:29,265
- You didn't tell us this before?
- I'm sorry. I didn't remember.

558
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,590
I'm not as big of a fan as she is.

559
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,226
Becky...

560
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,844
Tell me everything.

561
00:38:46,622 --> 00:38:47,622
You okay?

562
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,740
Yeah, you know.

563
00:38:51,008 --> 00:38:52,228
I think I'm good.

564
00:38:52,353 --> 00:38:54,790
You're not gonna believe it,
but I got a lead on the colt.

565
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:57,584
- What?
- Long story. Tell you on the way?

566
00:38:58,535 --> 00:39:00,235
What are we waiting for?

567
00:39:11,952 --> 00:39:14,881
Like a lot of authors,
I started writing because of love.

568
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:18,519
I had a huge crush on Nancy Mckeon,

569
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:20,732
who played Jo on The facts of life.

570
00:39:21,036 --> 00:39:25,021
I must've written her 40 to 50 letters.
She never wrote back.

571
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,752
I don't think the benders
made flesh suits

572
00:39:27,877 --> 00:39:29,927
out of all their victims, so...

573
00:39:30,182 --> 00:39:31,743
Maybe just a couple scarves.

574
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:34,545
Actually, my favorite movie
was Beaches.

575
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:38,375
Hillary and C.C were just...
so brave.

576
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,086
So strong.

577
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,917
The way I look at it,
it's really not jumping the shark

578
00:39:44,042 --> 00:39:46,174
if you never come back down,
you know?
