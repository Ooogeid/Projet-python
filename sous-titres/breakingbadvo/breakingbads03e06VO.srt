00:00:05,262 --> 00:00:07,958
<i>KDK-12, come in. KDK-12.</i>

2
00:00:08,153 --> 00:00:09,131
KDK-12.

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,725
<i>Need you to look in
on Mrs. Peyketewa.</i>

4
00:00:12,987 --> 00:00:14,041
She all right?

5
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:15,871
<i>Her daughter called from California,</i>

6
00:00:15,996 --> 00:00:18,547
<i>she hasn't heard from her in a while,
kind of worried.</i>

7
00:00:19,403 --> 00:00:20,395
Will do.

8
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,094
Miss Peyketewa, hello.

9
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:13,911
KDK-12 here.

10
00:03:14,036 --> 00:03:15,685
Janet, Jesus, we got a homicide.

11
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,941
- <i>Come again?</i>
- Miss Peyketewa, she's dead.

12
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:20,213
- I need some backup out here.
- <i>On their way.</i>

13
00:03:26,397 --> 00:03:29,439
Whoever's in there,
show yourself right now.

14
00:03:40,436 --> 00:03:42,511
Hold it right there!
Let me see your hands.

15
00:03:43,154 --> 00:03:44,056
Hands!

16
00:03:47,735 --> 00:03:48,864
All right, down.

17
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:50,104
On your knees.

18
00:03:51,128 --> 00:03:53,817
You understand me?
Do you speak English?

19
00:03:57,886 --> 00:04:00,402
I said down!
On your knees. Down!

20
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:07,311
Damn it, get down!
On your knees!

21
00:04:07,436 --> 00:04:08,301
Do it!

22
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,820
On your knees or I'll fire!

<i>I found the papers.</i>

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,960
<i>Right where you left them,

27
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,018
You know best, right?

28
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:10,398
Anything else?

29
00:05:10,873 --> 00:05:12,325
Do you have any thought

30
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,150
about how we're going to

31
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:16,067
approach this...

32
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,216
with Walter Jr?

33
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:19,943
<i>He's still my son.</i>

34
00:05:20,068 --> 00:05:22,010
- <i>I mean, he will remain...</i>
- Of course.

35
00:05:22,616 --> 00:05:25,309
<i>My point being</i>

36
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,134
the divorce.

37
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:34,714
I think he gets it.
Don't you?

38
00:05:36,998 --> 00:05:38,048
I mean, I...

39
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:40,851
I think he saw it coming.

40
00:05:41,964 --> 00:05:43,871
He sees your unhappiness and...

41
00:05:43,996 --> 00:05:45,712
<i>My unhappiness?</i>

42
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,550
<i>My completely...</i>

43
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:48,931
<i>out-of-the-clear,</i>

44
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:52,210
blue-sky unhappiness?

45
00:05:53,658 --> 00:05:54,508
<i>Really?</i>

46
00:05:55,746 --> 00:05:58,149
Look, as you said, for the best.

47
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:04,556
Last thing,
and then I'll let you go.

48
00:06:06,294 --> 00:06:08,600
<i>In the Child Support Worksheet,</i>

49
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,577
<i>you list medical, dental,</i>

50
00:06:11,517 --> 00:06:13,350
child care, transportation,

51
00:06:13,475 --> 00:06:15,401
housing, education,

52
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,065
<i>food, clothing.</i>

53
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,605
That's right, all of it.

54
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:26,760
<i>You wanted me out.</i>

55
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:29,763
I'm out, but I will
provide for my family.

56
00:06:30,037 --> 00:06:31,718
<i>Not with that money.</i>

57
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,080
You'd be making us
accessories after the fact.

58
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,386
How do you think
we've been paying our bills

59
00:06:37,511 --> 00:06:39,111
these last six months?

60
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:44,839
I have to go.

61
00:06:46,247 --> 00:06:47,329
Yep, I was right.

62
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:49,965
Three units available,
exact same floor plan.

63
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:53,202
I can call over, get you in
to see any of the others if you'd like.

64
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:54,837
This one's fine.

65
00:06:55,945 --> 00:06:57,095
I'll take it.

66
00:06:59,947 --> 00:07:02,465
Now, unfortunately,
this one is the...

67
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,680
- the model, so...
- Yeah, I like it.

68
00:07:05,764 --> 00:07:06,714
I like...

69
00:07:06,946 --> 00:07:08,984
everything about it.
I'll take it...

70
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:09,910
as is.

71
00:07:13,547 --> 00:07:16,215
Name one thing in this world
that is not negotiable.

72
00:07:30,497 --> 00:07:32,242
So we try to clean them every night,

73
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,585
but make sure it's off before
you open the intake valve.

74
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:37,379
Good.

75
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:39,458
Now, I suggest that you add this

76
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,828
- to your Monday maintenance schedule.
- Yes, sir.

77
00:07:47,894 --> 00:07:49,551
Main valve on, main switch on.

78
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:52,472
Give the compressor time
for the needle to enter the green.

79
00:08:04,453 --> 00:08:05,753
You're for real.

80
00:08:06,577 --> 00:08:07,569
This is all you?

81
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,944
All me.

82
00:08:09,175 --> 00:08:11,240
Heisenberg who?
That's what I say.

83
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,589
My man Jesse can cook.

84
00:08:13,837 --> 00:08:16,616
Check it, yo.
It ain't cloudy or dirty or nothing.

85
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:18,122
Just the right shade of blue.

86
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,499
- Good shade.
- Check out that crystal size,

87
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:23,502
If that bitch was any bigger,
it would be a Jolly Rancher.

88
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:25,212
Be my guest.

89
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:29,817
You sure?

90
00:08:30,624 --> 00:08:33,620
I feel kind of diggish with
you being in rehab and all.

91
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,753
I can watch.

92
00:08:37,721 --> 00:08:40,032
I can cook, and I can watch.

93
00:08:40,157 --> 00:08:43,078
Go for it. I tried it, like, last week.
I'm still coming down.

94
00:08:43,498 --> 00:08:44,398
Go easy.

95
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:06,969
<i>Riverdance!</i>

96
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,215
Stop marking up
my floor, dumbass. Come on.

97
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:16,346
Bow before me.

98
00:09:17,163 --> 00:09:19,416
I am Lord of the Dance.

99
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:24,252
Shit.
I gotta try that again.

100
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:26,355
I think you're good.

101
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:29,544
That is awesome, Jesse.

102
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,392
I feel like somebody took
my brain out

103
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:33,924
and boiled it

104
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,932
- in, like, boiling hot...
- It's the bomb, man, seriously.

105
00:09:37,555 --> 00:09:39,244
Like anthrax.

106
00:09:40,253 --> 00:09:41,049
Good.

107
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:43,129
So...

108
00:09:44,308 --> 00:09:46,043
You ready to talk some business?

109
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:50,871
This is not, like, just...
recreational?

110
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,093
I know...

111
00:09:55,186 --> 00:09:56,533
what you're thinking.

112
00:09:57,344 --> 00:09:59,725
Trust me. It's not going
to be like it was...

113
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,282
never gonna be like it was.

114
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:05,508
- How's that?
- We sell it safe.

115
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,663
All right? We sell it smart.

116
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,365
We don't get greedy...

117
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,610
Like before.

118
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,779
I don't know, man.

119
00:10:14,635 --> 00:10:15,897
Combo and all.

120
00:10:24,738 --> 00:10:25,738
Still.

121
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,147
Man's gotta make his living.

122
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,177
If it's like Jesse says

123
00:10:31,302 --> 00:10:33,228
and we're not greedy...

124
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,592
I guess I can see it.

125
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:40,762
Had a good thing going before
we started pushing our luck.

126
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,182
If it can go back to being
like that and all...

127
00:10:43,307 --> 00:10:44,557
It will be.

128
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,302
Step 1: we build inventory.

129
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:48,855
Badger, go see Clovis.

130
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:51,740
Get the RV in shape...
tune up, oil change,

131
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:53,442
brake lights, and whatnot.

132
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:55,877
Cops always pull you over
for brake lights.

133
00:10:56,002 --> 00:10:56,926
Not us.

134
00:10:57,701 --> 00:10:58,657
Cautious.

135
00:10:58,965 --> 00:11:00,009
You got it.

136
00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:01,702
You know that buzzer thing.

137
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:05,747
Leave the key in the ignition,
and it buzzes, whatever.

138
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:08,013
Just have him put
in one of those, too.

139
00:11:08,138 --> 00:11:10,377
Skinny, you're
in charge of supplies.

140
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:12,238
I'll get you a list.

141
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:13,857
Right on.

142
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:15,415
Yeah?

143
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:18,719
OK.

144
00:11:20,857 --> 00:11:21,857
So...

145
00:11:22,586 --> 00:11:23,586
we good?

146
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,112
Good.

147
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,150
Let's do this thing.

148
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,304
I know you.

149
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:50,421
Small world, Albuquerque.

150
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:53,446
Want to talk about it?

151
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,623
Why? It's not like I get a vote.

152
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:01,282
You know, ironically,

153
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:04,944
I think you're going to see
much more of me from now on.

154
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,618
Sure.

155
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,071
Just as much of me at least.

156
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:12,669
I'm taking you to the school,
to and from, every day.

157
00:13:12,794 --> 00:13:14,984
What, I don't get a vote
in this, either?

158
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,769
I gotta stop going with Louis

159
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:18,701
just because you're feeling guilty?

160
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:23,363
I do feel guilty.

161
00:13:28,969 --> 00:13:31,132
I am the man that I am, son,

162
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,285
and there's plenty I would
change about that, but...

163
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:38,713
Here we are

164
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:42,618
and this is just what it is.

165
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,075
You know what?
Call me crazy,

166
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,530
but I'm actually
feeling very good about the future.

167
00:14:30,464 --> 00:14:31,358
Morning.

168
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:33,497
They're back.

169
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,717
I'm just wondering if we should
maybe call the police or something.

170
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:40,135
Why?

171
00:14:40,995 --> 00:14:42,753
They're doing nothing wrong.

172
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,586
Let's put this on table 33, okay?

173
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,014
Hello, there.

174
00:16:19,288 --> 00:16:21,253
Mr. White, I presume?

175
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:23,684
Hi. I am...

176
00:16:24,796 --> 00:16:25,978
Sorry.

177
00:16:26,103 --> 00:16:27,483
I'll be right down.

178
00:16:37,552 --> 00:16:39,171
Hi. Gale Boetticher.

179
00:16:42,455 --> 00:16:44,343
You're my new lab assistant,
I take it.

180
00:16:45,181 --> 00:16:46,129
Yes, I am.

181
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,547
I suppose you'll want
to hear my qualifications.

182
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:51,307
I have my resume here for you.

183
00:16:53,992 --> 00:16:56,527
I received
my bachelor's degree from UNM,

184
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,124
my master's from
the University of Colorado.

185
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,029
Organic chemistry
with a specialty in...

186
00:17:03,426 --> 00:17:04,697
It's all right there.

187
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:07,434
"X-ray crystallography."

188
00:17:08,784 --> 00:17:09,611
Really.

189
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,397
I could talk about that for hours.

190
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:15,874
I would love to.

191
00:17:16,297 --> 00:17:18,854
Well, first, I'm curious about this.

192
00:17:22,194 --> 00:17:24,845
That's a little pet project of mine.

193
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:27,820
See, in my opinion,

194
00:17:27,945 --> 00:17:30,131
it's all about
the quinic acid level.

195
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,529
You want just north
of 4,800 milligrams per liter,

196
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,723
but if you over-boil to get there,
you're going to leach your tannins.

197
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,619
Bitterness. Yuck.

198
00:17:41,402 --> 00:17:43,645
So I pull a mild vacuum.

199
00:17:43,985 --> 00:17:47,613
That way, I can keep the temperature
no higher than 92 C,

200
00:17:51,535 --> 00:17:52,818
Let's see.

201
00:17:53,651 --> 00:17:55,641
Judge for yourself.

202
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:10,319
My God.

203
00:18:17,988 --> 00:18:21,442
My God, that is the best
coffee I've ever tasted.

204
00:18:24,256 --> 00:18:25,585
Sumatran beans,

205
00:18:26,335 --> 00:18:28,544
and I also have to give
credit to the grind,

206
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,591
but...

207
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,220
thank you, Mr. White.

208
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:33,090
Walt, please.

209
00:18:33,215 --> 00:18:34,500
Call me Walt.

210
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:37,515
Why the hell are we making meth?

211
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,135
Tell me...

212
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,799
with the phenylacetic acid solution,

213
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:56,279
you said 150 drops per minute

214
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,094
for the first 10 minutes,

215
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,472
and then 90 for the remainder.

216
00:20:00,597 --> 00:20:01,697
Why is that?

217
00:20:04,396 --> 00:20:05,668
My thinking is,

218
00:20:06,052 --> 00:20:08,540
by tapering the phenyl,
you get an...

219
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,316
oilier aqueous layer, and hence...

220
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:13,002
Better benzene extraction.

221
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:15,115
Exactly.

222
00:20:16,053 --> 00:20:18,126
But actually I prefer ether.

223
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,927
I'll have it for tomorrow.

224
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:31,160
I'm wondering how you...

225
00:20:31,285 --> 00:20:32,856
Ended up here.

226
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,347
Actually,

227
00:20:35,472 --> 00:20:37,433
I'm still wondering
how I ended up here,

228
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:39,160
but, yes.

229
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:41,813
I mean, I can't imagine

230
00:20:42,469 --> 00:20:44,347
we strike each other as criminals.

231
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:48,290
There's crime,

232
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,207
and then there's crime,

233
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,339
I suppose.

234
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,093
I'm definitely a libertarian.

235
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,072
Consenting adults
want what they want,

236
00:20:58,462 --> 00:21:01,800
and if I'm not supplying it,
they will get it somewhere else.

237
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:04,636
At least with me, they're getting
exactly what they pay for.

238
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:07,809
No added toxins or adulterants.

239
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,989
Yeah, I was doing it
the way you are supposed to,

240
00:21:14,131 --> 00:21:15,647
pursuing my doctorate at Colorado,

241
00:21:15,772 --> 00:21:17,278
NSF research grant.

242
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:19,484
I was on my way,

243
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,895
jumping through hoops,
kissing the proper behinds,

244
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,891
attending to all the non-chemistry

245
00:21:26,016 --> 00:21:28,047
that one finds oneself
occupied with.

246
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,028
You know that world.

247
00:21:30,397 --> 00:21:33,022
That is not what I signed on for.

248
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,677
I love the lab.

249
00:21:41,846 --> 00:21:43,648
Because it's all still magic.

250
00:21:44,226 --> 00:21:45,053
You know?

251
00:21:47,137 --> 00:21:48,264
Chemistry?

252
00:21:52,146 --> 00:21:54,109
Once you lose that...

253
00:21:54,234 --> 00:21:55,313
It is.

254
00:21:56,405 --> 00:21:57,656
It is magic.

255
00:21:58,205 --> 00:21:59,353
It still is.

256
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:04,081
And all the while I kept thinking

257
00:22:04,206 --> 00:22:06,088
about that great, old Whitman poem.

258
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,501
"When I Heard
the Learn'd Astronomer."

259
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:11,160
Walt Whitman.

260
00:22:11,285 --> 00:22:12,604
I... I don't know it.

261
00:22:13,281 --> 00:22:14,372
Anyway...

262
00:22:14,497 --> 00:22:15,864
Well, can you recite it?

263
00:22:20,054 --> 00:22:22,527
Pathetically enough I could.

264
00:22:22,652 --> 00:22:23,951
All right, well...

265
00:22:25,288 --> 00:22:27,142
Come on.
Come on.

266
00:22:33,992 --> 00:22:36,087
When I heard the learn'd astronomer;

267
00:22:37,011 --> 00:22:39,356
When the proofs, the figures,

268
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:42,033
were ranged in columns before me;

269
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:45,258
When I was shown the charts
and the diagrams,

270
00:22:45,383 --> 00:22:47,583
to add, divide, and measure them;

271
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:51,309
When I, sitting, heard the
astronomer, where he lectured

272
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:54,747
with much applause
in the lecture-room,

273
00:22:56,255 --> 00:22:58,691
How soon, unaccountable,

274
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,918
I became tired and sick;

275
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,745
Till rising and gliding out,

276
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,708
I wander'd off by myself,

277
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,880
In the mystical moist night-air,

278
00:23:10,153 --> 00:23:11,696
and from time to time,

279
00:23:12,514 --> 00:23:14,631
Look'd up in perfect silence

280
00:23:14,756 --> 00:23:16,391
at the stars.

281
00:23:25,748 --> 00:23:26,935
I am a nerd.

282
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:32,221
- Bravo.
- Thank you.

283
00:23:35,865 --> 00:23:37,097
Come on, Pinkman.

284
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:41,930
You little rat bastard. Get off
your lazy ass and go break the law.

285
00:24:18,697 --> 00:24:21,247
- Hey, baby.
- <i>Are you ever coming home?</i>

286
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:23,669
- I'm working. All right?
- <i>Did you find it?</i>

287
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:24,837
The RV?

288
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,631
<i>Nope. Working on it, so...</i>

289
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,251
Why can't you just arrest him,

290
00:24:30,376 --> 00:24:31,570
make him tell you?

291
00:24:32,457 --> 00:24:35,304
<i>It's not that simple.
There's a thing called the Constitution.</i>

292
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:37,406
The Constitution, blah, blah, blah.

293
00:24:41,276 --> 00:24:44,226
<i>This kid, I swear to God,
I wish I just could...</i>

294
00:24:45,563 --> 00:24:47,959
This is that Pinkman character?

295
00:24:48,374 --> 00:24:49,624
<i>That's the one.</i>

296
00:24:49,749 --> 00:24:51,864
<i>Positive the little bastard
has got an RV,</i>

297
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,108
and I just don't know
where he keeps it.

298
00:24:54,511 --> 00:24:56,946
Until he actually leads me
to where...

299
00:24:57,071 --> 00:24:59,923
or does something,
I'm stuck here, Marie.

300
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,624
<i>Sorry.</i>

301
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:06,197
Not to bring up ancient history,

302
00:25:06,322 --> 00:25:10,220
but I for one can think of someone
who might know something...

303
00:25:11,671 --> 00:25:12,671
possibly.

304
00:25:13,534 --> 00:25:14,887
It's worth a shot.

305
00:25:18,388 --> 00:25:19,388
Who?

306
00:25:25,047 --> 00:25:27,060
<i>Hey, buddy.
Hey, how you doing?</i>

307
00:25:27,185 --> 00:25:28,735
Hey, Hank. What's up?

308
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:31,236
<i>Listen, I hate to bother you.
I just...</i>

309
00:25:31,361 --> 00:25:32,886
<i>I just have a quick question.</i>

310
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:34,188
Shoot.

311
00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:36,200
<i>I'm only asking you this
because I'm at a</i>

312
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,168
dead-end here potentially.

313
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:40,421
I'm working a case, and...

314
00:25:43,374 --> 00:25:44,584
Listen, you gotta know

315
00:25:44,915 --> 00:25:47,437
<i>that I would never put you on the spot
or make you uncomfortable.</i>

316
00:25:48,312 --> 00:25:50,365
You could just cut to the chase.

317
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,507
<i>Back when we...</i>

318
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,675
lost you

319
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:54,969
and I was trying to track you down

320
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,394
<i>through a former student
of yours, Jesse Pinkman,</i>

321
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:59,348
<i>now, you know...</i>

322
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:03,019
that I know that once upon a time
he may have dealt you

323
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,193
<i>a little weed.</i>

324
00:26:04,668 --> 00:26:07,940
<i>Just a little, and I so
do not care about that.</i>

325
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,359
As far as I'm concerned,
you never inhaled, okay?

326
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,256
<i>Like you said, cut to the chase.</i>

327
00:26:12,381 --> 00:26:15,144
<i>Do you remember if this Pinkman kid</i>

328
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:16,869
<i>ever had an RV?</i>

329
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:22,872
<i>You know, a recreational vehicle,</i>

330
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,523
you know,
like a Winnebago-type deal,

331
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,593
<i>brown and beige?</i>

332
00:26:30,705 --> 00:26:31,705
Why?

333
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,647
<i>It's a long story, but I personally
think that he's moved on from weed</i>

334
00:26:35,772 --> 00:26:38,222
<i>and graduated
to selling crystal meth,</i>

335
00:26:38,733 --> 00:26:40,786
<i>using it as a rolling lab.</i>

336
00:27:28,118 --> 00:27:30,109
<i>How's my favorite genius?</i>

337
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:31,601
Is this a secure line?

338
00:27:32,158 --> 00:27:33,407
<i>Is this a secure...</i>

339
00:27:33,532 --> 00:27:34,694
<i>Yes, what's with the...</i>

340
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,197
Hey, hello to you, too.

341
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:37,530
<i>We've got a problem,</i>

342
00:27:37,816 --> 00:27:38,906
a DEA problem.

343
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,685
- I'm listening.
- <i>My brother-in-law,</i>

344
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,410
<i>he knows about the RV.</i>

345
00:27:43,082 --> 00:27:43,911
What RV?

346
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,363
Our RV,

347
00:27:45,636 --> 00:27:47,540
the one which contains a meth lab,

348
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:50,295
<i>which is covered with my fingerprints.
Ring a bell?</i>

349
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,548
What exactly does "knows about" mean?
Does he have it? Has he searched it?

350
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:56,424
No, he knows it exists,
and he's trying to find it.

351
00:27:56,846 --> 00:27:59,068
<i>He has linked it to Jesse,
and it's only a matter of time</i>

352
00:27:59,193 --> 00:28:00,669
<i>before he tracks it down...</i>

353
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,585
<i>So get rid of it. What are you doing
sitting here talking to me for?</i>

354
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,980
<i>Better yet,
have Pinkman get rid of it.</i>

355
00:28:06,105 --> 00:28:07,226
You don't go near it.

356
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,271
My brother-in-law is surveying Jesse.
Do you understand?

357
00:28:10,712 --> 00:28:13,274
<i>So he might've tapped the phones
or bugged his house.</i>

358
00:28:13,744 --> 00:28:15,484
<i>Jesus. Plan A, then.</i>

359
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,278
Go. Get to it before the feds do.

360
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,614
And do what exactly?

361
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,210
I mean, what...

362
00:28:22,715 --> 00:28:26,495
The thing...
The thing is the size of a...

363
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,247
It's RV size.

364
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:31,000
<i>I mean, where do I go
to make an RV disappear?</i>

365
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:33,794
- I'm not David Copperfield.
- <i>What do I look like,</i>

366
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,672
the RV disposal people?
Did you not plan

367
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,632
- <i>for this contingency?</i>
- No.

368
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,509
Next time, plan for it, would you?

369
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,429
<i>The Starship Enterprise had
a self-destruct button. I'm just saying.</i>

370
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,180
Okay, shut up.

371
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,515
I'm just saying, you know,

372
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,112
you're good with tools and all.

373
00:28:49,237 --> 00:28:51,009
Why don't you invent

374
00:28:51,134 --> 00:28:53,934
a water-powered car, you know?

375
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:56,883
If you did that,
you would be rolling in it.

376
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,960
Socket wrench.

377
00:29:00,387 --> 00:29:01,487
The big one.

378
00:29:04,752 --> 00:29:06,452
You scared of the Arabs?

379
00:29:13,246 --> 00:29:14,502
Are you out of your mind?

380
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,540
- Why is this out in the open?
- Who are you?

381
00:29:16,665 --> 00:29:17,797
He's Heisenberg.

382
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:20,472
- Is this drivable? Does it run?
- Yeah, I was just changing the oil.

383
00:29:20,597 --> 00:29:21,841
Finish it, quickly.

384
00:29:21,966 --> 00:29:24,160
We'll wipe it clean
and take it out to the desert.

385
00:29:24,285 --> 00:29:25,220
Help me.

386
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:27,589
Hold up.
What's this about?

387
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,390
The DEA,

388
00:29:29,722 --> 00:29:32,353
the Drug Enforcement Administration.
You've heard of them, haven't you?

389
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:33,514
I know you have.

390
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:36,023
They know all about this RV,
and they're trying to find it

391
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,191
right now.

392
00:29:38,979 --> 00:29:40,402
I want this off my property now.

393
00:29:41,469 --> 00:29:43,004
We have got to destroy the evidence.

394
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:45,157
We've got to burn this thing.
Do you understand?

395
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,701
- Not here you don't. Just get it out.
- Now, listen to me.

396
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,183
I need your help, okay?

397
00:29:49,308 --> 00:29:51,289
If I go down, we all go down.

398
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,665
Do you understand?

399
00:29:54,017 --> 00:29:55,417
All right, just...

400
00:29:55,969 --> 00:29:57,044
I know a better way.

401
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,672
I know a guy that'll wipe this off
the planet, no questions asked.

402
00:30:00,247 --> 00:30:01,090
Call him.

403
00:30:07,813 --> 00:30:09,061
What about Jesse?

404
00:30:09,186 --> 00:30:10,141
What about him?

405
00:30:20,926 --> 00:30:22,076
Hey, it's me.

406
00:30:22,502 --> 00:30:23,779
Wanna hear something weird?

407
00:30:24,307 --> 00:30:25,678
Now, listen to me.

408
00:30:25,803 --> 00:30:28,444
You get that address.
Now, Badger, I don't care how!

409
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:30,769
You find out where he's taking it!

410
00:30:55,752 --> 00:30:57,602
Excuse me. Are you leaving?

411
00:31:12,992 --> 00:31:14,346
Excuse me, gentlemen.

412
00:31:14,471 --> 00:31:15,985
This booth is for paying customers.

413
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,560
Cynthia, it's okay.

414
00:31:18,241 --> 00:31:19,591
I'll handle this.

415
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:57,414
96, 97,

416
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,228
98, 99, 100.

417
00:32:00,688 --> 00:32:02,338
Beyond recovery, right?

418
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,931
- Now, beyond recovery means...
- I get it. Beyond recovery.

419
00:32:06,056 --> 00:32:08,794
- Obliterated, no evidence.
- Don't worry.

420
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:11,819
When we're through with it,
it's going to be about yea big, okay?

421
00:32:11,944 --> 00:32:13,893
Then we flatbed it
over to Long Beach,

422
00:32:14,018 --> 00:32:15,815
ship it across the Pacific.

423
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,193
Chinese turn it
into patio furniture,

424
00:32:18,318 --> 00:32:20,869
so... mind at ease.

425
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,805
Can you do me a favor?
I'm obviously going to...

426
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,610
need a ride.
Could you call a cab?

427
00:32:26,735 --> 00:32:28,371
You got it.
Pleasure doing business.

428
00:32:28,496 --> 00:32:31,372
Thank you. I'll be right behind you.
I just need to...

429
00:33:10,854 --> 00:33:11,905
What are you doing?

430
00:33:12,302 --> 00:33:14,325
- Me?
- This is mine just as much as yours!

431
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,489
You don't get to just...

432
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:17,931
What?

433
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:24,360
What?

434
00:33:26,252 --> 00:33:27,087
He's here.

435
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:28,959
Who's here?

436
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:45,029
You led him right to us.

437
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:09,544
Mr. Pinkman,
you want to add resisting arrest?

438
00:35:09,669 --> 00:35:12,013
We'll add it.
No skin off my ass.

439
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:15,489
Last chance to do it the easy way.

440
00:35:56,141 --> 00:35:57,341
Got a warrant?

441
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:00,657
Who are you?

442
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,534
What do you know about this RV?

443
00:36:03,256 --> 00:36:05,063
Well, I'm the owner of this lot,

444
00:36:05,188 --> 00:36:07,289
which means
you're trespassing on private property.

445
00:36:08,629 --> 00:36:10,667
As far as the RV goes,
seems to me it's locked,

446
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,463
which means you're trying to break
and enter, so I say again,

447
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,031
you got a warrant?

448
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,048
I don't need one
if I've got probable cause,

449
00:36:20,173 --> 00:36:21,220
counselor.

450
00:36:21,735 --> 00:36:25,224
Probable cause usually relates
to vehicles, is my understanding,

451
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,851
you know, traffic stops and whatnot.

452
00:36:28,324 --> 00:36:29,728
See these round rubber things?

453
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,920
Wheels.

454
00:36:32,604 --> 00:36:33,857
This is a vehicle.

455
00:36:34,935 --> 00:36:37,653
This is a domicile, a residence,

456
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,114
and thus protected
by the Fourth Amendment

457
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,770
from unlawful search and seizure.

458
00:36:42,895 --> 00:36:44,952
- Why don't you just go out and...
- Did you see this

459
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,219
drive in here?

460
00:36:46,344 --> 00:36:47,538
How do you know it runs?

461
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,256
Did you actually witness
any wrongdoing?

462
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,115
It seems to me
you're just out here...

463
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,240
fishing.

464
00:36:56,552 --> 00:36:59,105
Don't see that
holding up in a court of law.

465
00:37:03,884 --> 00:37:05,251
Well, look at these.

466
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,143
What do those look like to you?

467
00:37:10,872 --> 00:37:13,146
They sure look like bullet holes
to me.

468
00:37:13,746 --> 00:37:16,024
There was a firearm discharged
inside of this

469
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,242
"domicile".

470
00:37:18,127 --> 00:37:21,353
Willing to bet there's a judge or two
who'd see that as probable cause,

471
00:37:22,184 --> 00:37:23,467
but why don't you call...

472
00:37:23,592 --> 00:37:26,218
How could you have known
that they were there

473
00:37:26,343 --> 00:37:28,679
before you took off the tape?

474
00:37:29,234 --> 00:37:30,026
What?

475
00:37:30,287 --> 00:37:32,773
How could you have known
that they were there

476
00:37:32,898 --> 00:37:35,298
before you took off the tape?
Say it.

477
00:37:35,868 --> 00:37:36,868
Say it.

478
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:43,176
How could you have known that they were
there before you took off the tape?

479
00:37:44,133 --> 00:37:45,283
That's right.

480
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:48,265
Probable cause
needs to be readily apparent.

481
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:52,523
There's somebody in there.

482
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:56,325
... private domicile
and I won't be harassed.

483
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,888
Probable cause or no,
I'll give you three seconds

484
00:37:59,013 --> 00:38:00,949
to get your ass out here.

485
00:38:01,074 --> 00:38:02,450
1, 2...

486
00:38:02,575 --> 00:38:06,125
This is my own private domicile,
and I will not be harassed.

487
00:38:06,883 --> 00:38:07,883
Bitch.

488
00:38:18,284 --> 00:38:20,547
Fine. You want your warrant?

489
00:38:22,765 --> 00:38:26,363
I'll have my guys bring it out here
and deliver it on a little satin pillow.

490
00:38:26,488 --> 00:38:27,346
How's that?

491
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,740
I waited this long.

492
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:32,067
Wait a little longer.

493
00:38:52,991 --> 00:38:54,041
Hey, Vicky.

494
00:38:54,387 --> 00:38:56,583
Yeah, Schrader.
Give me Merkert, will you?

495
00:39:06,516 --> 00:39:08,723
You know, I say...

496
00:39:09,895 --> 00:39:11,495
I say we just ram him.

497
00:39:11,962 --> 00:39:12,962
All right?

498
00:39:16,724 --> 00:39:17,961
We start her up

499
00:39:18,086 --> 00:39:20,586
and just ram the shit
out of his truck.

500
00:39:20,986 --> 00:39:22,786
We make our escape. Right?

501
00:39:30,247 --> 00:39:32,047
He'd shoot me in the head.

502
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,240
Yeah, he'd shoot me in the head.

503
00:39:37,348 --> 00:39:38,698
So what do we do?

504
00:39:45,105 --> 00:39:47,092
Please tell me

505
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,660
you got something.

506
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,526
I got something.

507
00:40:08,831 --> 00:40:09,831
It's me.

508
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:12,561
We need your help.

509
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,920
<i>Is this Mr. Henry R. Schrader?</i>

510
00:40:40,073 --> 00:40:41,275
Yeah. Who's this?

511
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,878
<i>Sir, this is Officer Elaine Tanner
with the Albuquerque Police.</i>

512
00:40:45,003 --> 00:40:46,526
<i>Is your wife Marie Schrader?</i>

513
00:40:47,507 --> 00:40:48,507
Yes, why?

514
00:40:49,033 --> 00:40:52,186
<i>I'm sorry to inform you that your wife
has been in an automobile accident.</i>

515
00:40:52,311 --> 00:40:54,730
<i>She's being airlifted
to Los Ranchos Medical Center</i>

516
00:40:54,855 --> 00:40:57,255
<i>and should be arriving there
shortly.</i>

517
00:40:59,149 --> 00:41:00,799
How is she?
What's her condition?

518
00:41:00,924 --> 00:41:01,924
<i>I don't...</i>

519
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,711
<i>have the most current information,
sir,</i>

520
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,392
<i>but I think you might want to get there
as soon as possible.</i>

521
00:41:09,876 --> 00:41:11,885
You're going to have to start
paying me more.

522
00:42:10,376 --> 00:42:12,445
<i>I'm just checking in.</i>
<i>I'd love to have some idea</i>

523
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,419
<i>of whether I should
cook dinner or not.</i>

524
00:42:15,763 --> 00:42:16,913
Are you okay?

525
00:42:18,899 --> 00:42:19,899
<i>Why?</i>

526
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,960
<i>What's up?</i>
