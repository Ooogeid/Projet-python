00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,588
<i>We may have a wife problem.
Look, I need eyes on it.</i>

3
00:00:04,858 --> 00:00:06,297
You got an address?

4
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:08,771
$3 million

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,513
for three months of your time.

6
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:11,469
I'm done.

7
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,315
El Paso wants me back.

8
00:00:26,057 --> 00:00:27,176
I fucked Ted.

9
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:12,724
So cigarettes and gas is...

10
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,930
$79.70 cents.

11
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:18,677
Crap.

12
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,850
There's an ATM right outside.

13
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,859
I don't have a card.

14
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:28,555
You can write
a personal check with I.D.

15
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:32,546
Kind of in between banks right now.

16
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:35,824
You think I could just

17
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:37,079
come back later?

18
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:40,128
I'm totally good for it.
I'd come back. I swear.

19
00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:44,562
If it were me, I'd be,

20
00:01:45,116 --> 00:01:46,687
"Totally, you know, no problem."

21
00:01:46,812 --> 00:01:49,567
But my dad is this ginormous
hard ass.

22
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,960
He was in Fallujah for a year,

23
00:01:52,309 --> 00:01:55,434
and he always checks the receipts.
I mean, like... always.

24
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,075
I've got to call him.
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,035
Wait.

26
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,693
Hold on a second.

27
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,827
Maybe if we could,

28
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:08,515
trade.

29
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:16,494
Ever try it?

30
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,640
I smoke pot a lot sometimes.

31
00:02:22,556 --> 00:02:23,684
I party.

32
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:25,020
But...

33
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,636
But that stuff's really addictive,
right?

34
00:02:27,761 --> 00:02:30,216
Not really. It's just a media thing.

35
00:02:30,926 --> 00:02:31,876
You know?

36
00:02:36,237 --> 00:02:37,487
What's it like?

37
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:44,237
It's awesome.

38
00:02:46,906 --> 00:02:48,000
Everything's

39
00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:50,859
maximum interesting.

40
00:02:51,812 --> 00:02:52,962
You get these

41
00:02:53,142 --> 00:02:54,250
really cold

42
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,142
and sharp-like

43
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,036
action dagger feelings.

44
00:03:02,955 --> 00:03:04,080
It's awesome.

45
00:03:06,321 --> 00:03:07,221
Come on.

46
00:03:07,761 --> 00:03:09,032
What do you say?

47
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:43,596
Have a nice day.

50
00:04:23,674 --> 00:04:25,014
How does it feel?

51
00:04:25,877 --> 00:04:26,932
Does it hurt?

52
00:04:27,838 --> 00:04:28,838
It's tight.

53
00:04:29,793 --> 00:04:31,329
But is it painful?

54
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:33,564
It's hard to breathe.

55
00:04:34,614 --> 00:04:36,507
You need your breathing.

56
00:04:38,498 --> 00:04:40,748
Although let's not
lose sight of the fact

57
00:04:40,873 --> 00:04:43,328
that you were the victim
of a terrible accident, Antonio,

58
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:45,853
so some discomfort
is to be expected.

59
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,576
Let's go with that one.

60
00:05:02,227 --> 00:05:06,111
And spread the word.
I'm building a class-action, flight 515.

61
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:07,995
Victims' families would be great,

62
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,754
but I'll take anyone
on he ground who suffered emotionally...

63
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,700
anxiety, sleeplessness,
you get the picture.

64
00:05:14,245 --> 00:05:15,191
Trouble?

65
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:19,272
<i>Ted Beneke?
You cannot be serious.</i>

66
00:05:19,397 --> 00:05:21,277
<i>That guys is a joke.</i>

67
00:05:21,402 --> 00:05:22,571
<i>I called...</i>

68
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,402
<i>I called...
What does that even mean?</i>

69
00:05:24,527 --> 00:05:27,763
<i>You dared me to tell the police,
and I couldn't do it, so you win.</i>

70
00:05:27,888 --> 00:05:31,352
<i>If you want to stay in this house,
fine, but we are not married anymore.</i>

71
00:05:31,477 --> 00:05:34,272
<i>I told you that I was done
cooking meth, Skyler.</i>

72
00:05:34,763 --> 00:05:36,130
<i>I promised you that.</i>

73
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,920
<i>At least I didn't run off to go...</i>

74
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,299
<i>Everything that I did
I did for this family.</i>

75
00:05:42,794 --> 00:05:44,408
<i>You just keep telling that.</i>

76
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:46,051
<i>And what is that supposed to mean?</i>

77
00:05:46,176 --> 00:05:47,721
<i>You don't like it?
Then leave</i>

78
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:50,372
- <i>and take your drug money with you.</i>
- <i>That's what you want.</i>

79
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:53,739
Jesus.

80
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,738
Garbage disposal.

81
00:05:56,514 --> 00:05:58,631
<i>You think this will get me
to move out?</i>

82
00:05:58,756 --> 00:06:01,535
<i>You can screw Ted.
You can screw the butcher,</i>

83
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,188
<i>the mailman, whoever you want.
Screw them all.</i>

84
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:05,781
<i>I'm not going anywhere.</i>

85
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,149
<i>Suit yourself.</i>

86
00:06:08,407 --> 00:06:10,307
Is this a good or bad thing?

87
00:06:12,877 --> 00:06:16,250
<i>You want me to suit myself?
I'll suit myself to his face!</i>

88
00:06:17,065 --> 00:06:18,093
It's a bad thing.

89
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,863
Walter White to see Ted Beneke.

90
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:37,285
I'm sorry.
Mr. Beneke's on a conference call.

91
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:41,775
I will wait.

92
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:44,407
It could be a while.

93
00:06:44,532 --> 00:06:46,653
I have all the time in the world.

94
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,693
Here we go.

95
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,146
Excuse me.
Mr. Beneke's not available.

96
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,063
- Come on.
- Sir.

97
00:07:21,553 --> 00:07:22,678
Excuse me.

98
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,512
I can see you.
I can see you

99
00:07:27,637 --> 00:07:30,407
standing right there in your office.
Now, come on.

100
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:32,826
Open the door.
Come on,

101
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,412
let's talk.
I just want to talk. That's all.

102
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:38,248
Come on, let's be men about this.
How about that?

103
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,420
I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now.

104
00:07:43,884 --> 00:07:44,797
Yes, you are.

105
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,768
So open the door.

106
00:07:47,027 --> 00:07:49,277
You're damn right you are.
You're right in the middle.

107
00:07:49,483 --> 00:07:51,795
Just open the door,
and let's talk about it, okay?

108
00:07:52,121 --> 00:07:54,181
Open the door, Ted, right now.

109
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:57,433
You don't want
to be a man about it? Okay.

110
00:07:57,558 --> 00:07:59,353
Plan B. How do you like that?
Plan B.

111
00:08:10,395 --> 00:08:11,995
What are you doing?

112
00:08:13,002 --> 00:08:14,552
I'm talking with Ted.

113
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:26,972
Next time,

114
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,670
you'll open...

115
00:08:29,202 --> 00:08:30,175
the door.

116
00:08:33,126 --> 00:08:34,024
Damn it.

117
00:08:39,196 --> 00:08:41,687
Can I just talk?
I just want to talk to him.

118
00:08:41,942 --> 00:08:43,005
Calm down.

119
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,592
All right, I'm calm.

120
00:09:08,786 --> 00:09:10,384
What do you want?

121
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,329
Come on.

122
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,928
What the hell is wrong with you?

123
00:09:18,053 --> 00:09:20,472
You act like you're the first guy
this ever happened to.

124
00:09:20,597 --> 00:09:24,191
I caught my second wife
screwing my stepdad, okay?

125
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:27,173
It's a cruel world, Walt.
Grow up.

126
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:31,580
I just wanted to talk to him.
Yeah, well, now I'm talking to you.

127
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,606
Consider this an intervention.

128
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:37,146
You could have been arrested back there.
You understand.

129
00:09:37,271 --> 00:09:40,279
Speaking as your lawyer,
I'm always looking for billable hours,

130
00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:42,456
but speaking
as your business associate,

131
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,500
I'm strongly advising
that you get your shit together.

132
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,588
Just cool it with this Beneke guy,
at least for now.

133
00:09:52,311 --> 00:09:53,642
Let's talk shop

134
00:09:54,244 --> 00:09:56,155
because I think
this is a great opportunity

135
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,732
to channel some of that negative energy
into something positive.

136
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,673
How did you know?

137
00:10:02,217 --> 00:10:03,009
Sorry?

138
00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:04,450
About Skyler.

139
00:10:04,575 --> 00:10:07,421
About where to find me just now.
How did you know?

140
00:10:08,381 --> 00:10:12,131
That's just my meticulousness.
Don't bog down in detail.

141
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:15,322
- The lesson here...
- Did you bug my house?

142
00:10:20,714 --> 00:10:22,955
I didn't know it was your house, did I?
You had moved out.

143
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,039
- Besides, you basically told me to.
- I told you to?

144
00:10:26,164 --> 00:10:28,043
You strongly hinted that I should.

145
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,462
You were worried
about your wife, remember?

146
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,898
You were concerned she might say
something to the police.

147
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:36,215
What? That's not true.
When the hell did I say that?

148
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,124
Let's not get lost in the who,
what, and whens.

149
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:42,933
The point
is we did our due diligence,

150
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,421
and she didn't talk.
She kept quiet.

151
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:47,591
She stood by you, which,

152
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:51,191
if you ask me,
is the ironical silver ling here.

153
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:53,714
On the one hand, sure,

154
00:10:54,478 --> 00:10:57,469
she snuck off the reservation
to get some dirty, damp, and deep.

155
00:10:57,871 --> 00:10:59,294
On the other hand...

156
00:11:15,368 --> 00:11:16,425
You're fired!

157
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,635
- You're done!
- Good.

158
00:11:19,717 --> 00:11:22,014
I won't cook meth anymore.
You're a crybaby.

159
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,205
Who needs you?

160
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,923
I'm unplugging the website,
so no more money laundering.

161
00:11:26,048 --> 00:11:29,721
- How do you like that?
- I want you to remove those bugs today.

162
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:31,675
I want them out now!

163
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,206
You just bought a $300 suit, psycho!

164
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:47,248
Great,
drilled right into the stucco.

165
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,305
A little bit of putty,

166
00:11:51,826 --> 00:11:52,794
you'll be fine.

167
00:11:54,578 --> 00:11:56,935
Just make sure
you get all of those things.

168
00:11:57,337 --> 00:11:58,129
A,

169
00:11:58,588 --> 00:12:01,391
these things cost $800 a piece.

170
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,486
B, you're not that interesting.

171
00:12:03,611 --> 00:12:05,444
So yeah, I'll get all of them.

172
00:12:07,911 --> 00:12:09,786
Great line of work, by the way.

173
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:12,147
Real upstanding field.

174
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:17,591
I enjoy it.

175
00:12:26,862 --> 00:12:28,558
You're free to leave now.

176
00:12:29,104 --> 00:12:29,998
Anytime.

177
00:12:31,828 --> 00:12:33,837
You know,

178
00:12:34,864 --> 00:12:38,525
sometimes it doesn't hurt to have
someone watching your back.

179
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:08,923
What's up?

180
00:14:13,164 --> 00:14:16,824
I can't begin to understand
what you're going through,

181
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:19,905
with all of your health concerns and

182
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,404
the stresses you've been under.

183
00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:24,552
Still, as educators,

184
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:27,731
there are certain responsibilities
we need to be meeting here

185
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:31,726
to the school
and to the students themselves.

186
00:14:32,011 --> 00:14:32,965
Of course.

187
00:14:35,253 --> 00:14:37,206
Is this a Wheaten terrier?

188
00:14:40,119 --> 00:14:41,012
Norfolk.

189
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:46,007
That's surprising.

190
00:14:48,007 --> 00:14:50,766
Could you come back over
here and have a seat, please?

191
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:52,924
Sure.

192
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:07,734
You've been absent a lot recently,

193
00:15:07,859 --> 00:15:10,594
and when you are here at school,

194
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,078
there have been
some behavioral questions,

195
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,198
and frankly I'm concerned.

196
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:20,168
Thank you.

197
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:31,107
Are you feeling okay?

198
00:15:31,967 --> 00:15:34,991
And do you think
maybe I should call Skyler?

199
00:15:44,016 --> 00:15:45,596
Let's just...

200
00:15:46,953 --> 00:15:48,655
keep this...

201
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,399
What's wrong with you?

202
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,039
You're the one
who was talking about D.C.

203
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:44,882
This is how you get there.

204
00:16:45,246 --> 00:16:47,689
You answer the bell.
You pay your dues.

205
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:53,853
Besides,
it's... you know, it's a big deal

206
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:55,628
to get picked for this.

207
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,630
El Paso's like

208
00:16:59,411 --> 00:17:00,661
the Super Bowl.

209
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:05,423
I could get killed
crossing the street, okay?

210
00:17:05,548 --> 00:17:06,740
Whatever.

211
00:17:07,278 --> 00:17:08,551
I want to go.

212
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,161
What about last time?

213
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,360
What about last time?

214
00:17:43,665 --> 00:17:44,457
Blue?

215
00:17:48,478 --> 00:17:49,428
Thing is,

216
00:17:50,832 --> 00:17:53,876
Thing is I'm supposed
to be getting on a plane right now.

217
00:17:58,851 --> 00:18:01,983
The stuff this guy had was blue.
You sure about that?

218
00:18:07,772 --> 00:18:09,372
I want to talk to him.

219
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:13,383
Taxi.

220
00:18:54,945 --> 00:18:56,477
I'm sorry.
I need to talk to you,

221
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,560
but you weren't at your apartment.

222
00:18:59,368 --> 00:19:00,768
I moved back home.

223
00:19:02,216 --> 00:19:03,641
That's good, right?

224
00:19:06,851 --> 00:19:08,501
Did you just get fired?

225
00:19:13,157 --> 00:19:14,402
More like a sabbatical.

226
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:16,439
Indefinite.

227
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:32,309
So

228
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:34,565
what's up?

229
00:19:35,186 --> 00:19:36,972
Should we go somewhere?

230
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:39,920
No. This is fine.

231
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,351
So,

232
00:19:44,586 --> 00:19:46,558
I want an intro to your guy.

233
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:47,821
What guy?

234
00:19:49,942 --> 00:19:51,856
Your guy.
Your distribution guy.

235
00:19:52,146 --> 00:19:55,151
- The guy Saul hooked you up with.
- Come on, Jesse.

236
00:19:55,836 --> 00:19:57,577
I thought about it,

237
00:19:58,157 --> 00:19:59,633
and I want to.

238
00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:01,827
It's the one thing I'm good at.

239
00:20:02,082 --> 00:20:04,602
No, that is just not true.

240
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,145
You're good at a lot of things, son.

241
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,745
Like what?

242
00:20:12,218 --> 00:20:13,968
What about your sobriety?

243
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,139
I told you. I'm not using.

244
00:20:18,204 --> 00:20:18,996
Ever.

245
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:21,050
I just want

246
00:20:21,396 --> 00:20:23,093
back into the business.

247
00:20:27,737 --> 00:20:28,812
I don't.

248
00:20:29,704 --> 00:20:30,583
I'm sorry.

249
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,059
I know, and that's cool.

250
00:20:33,402 --> 00:20:35,895
I'm not asking you to cook.

251
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:40,722
What's this?

252
00:20:41,697 --> 00:20:44,416
In the end, I just went with

253
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:48,488
two reflux condensers. I didn't
want to lose track of my Ph levels,

254
00:20:48,836 --> 00:20:52,167
but I did everything else
just like you taught me.

255
00:20:54,778 --> 00:20:57,048
Super careful in my amounts

256
00:20:57,546 --> 00:21:00,396
and watched the numbers
every step of the way.

257
00:21:01,088 --> 00:21:02,638
So what do you think?

258
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,340
It's good, right?

259
00:21:07,134 --> 00:21:07,926
What

260
00:21:09,052 --> 00:21:10,102
in the hell

261
00:21:10,995 --> 00:21:12,025
is this?

262
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:14,023
What?

263
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,566
What? This. This.

264
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,484
This is my product.

265
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,786
This is my formula.
This is mine.

266
00:21:20,911 --> 00:21:23,212
It's our product,

267
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:27,535
- but yeah, I was going to cut you in.
- You were going to cut me in?

268
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:29,899
I cut you in.

269
00:21:30,354 --> 00:21:33,969
What the hell is your problem?
All I'm asking is for you to set a meet.

270
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,523
Absolutely not.

271
00:21:35,648 --> 00:21:36,440
Why?

272
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,314
Because I am not going to lend
my name to an inferior product.

273
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:44,289
Look at the diameters here.

274
00:21:45,046 --> 00:21:46,721
What did you use for reduction?

275
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:47,943
Don't tell me.

276
00:21:48,068 --> 00:21:49,863
Platinum dioxide, right?

277
00:21:50,908 --> 00:21:53,070
Mercury-aluminum amalgam.

278
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,480
The dioxide's too hard to keep wet.

279
00:21:57,132 --> 00:21:59,060
You must've done it wrong, then.

280
00:21:59,302 --> 00:22:03,016
Your color is all cloudy, so you were
struggling with distillation, too.

281
00:22:03,141 --> 00:22:05,490
Now, this is very shoddy work,
Pinkman.

282
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:07,992
I'm actually embarrassed for you.

283
00:22:08,565 --> 00:22:09,357
What?

284
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,499
No way. I gave out samples,
and everyone said it was the bomb.

285
00:22:15,723 --> 00:22:17,759
They said it was the bomb.

286
00:22:18,366 --> 00:22:20,125
And who are they? I wonder.

287
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,638
A bunch of meth heads?

288
00:22:22,557 --> 00:22:24,257
They should know, right?

289
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:26,557
Sorry.
I can't help you.

290
00:22:26,682 --> 00:22:27,804
Fine, ass wad.

291
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,955
You know what?
I'll contact the guy myself.

292
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,885
Good luck with that
because my guy is a pro,

293
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,477
and he doesn't deal with junkies.

294
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:37,709
- You know what? Eat me.
- Anytime, loser.

295
00:23:19,491 --> 00:23:21,520
I can't believe it's only 4:00.

296
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,178
This day is dragging.

297
00:24:04,229 --> 00:24:05,613
I wish I could stay.

298
00:24:07,011 --> 00:24:08,011
So stay.

299
00:24:11,963 --> 00:24:13,248
What's stopping you?

300
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,911
What?
Like everything, you mean?

301
00:24:19,594 --> 00:24:22,994
How about my lunatic husband
refusing to leave the house?

302
00:24:26,261 --> 00:24:27,561
So move in here.

303
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:30,918
And then my son

304
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:33,509
hating me even more.

305
00:24:35,415 --> 00:24:36,265
It'll pass.

306
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,050
I went through that with the girls.

307
00:24:38,175 --> 00:24:39,225
They adapt.

308
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:41,646
And now everyone at work

309
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,464
thinks I'm an evil,
ladder-climbing whore.

310
00:24:44,714 --> 00:24:46,850
They're all fired
effective immediately.

311
00:24:47,614 --> 00:24:48,444
What else?

312
00:24:51,071 --> 00:24:52,871
Aren't you the answer man.

313
00:24:57,392 --> 00:24:58,642
Where did it...

314
00:25:02,694 --> 00:25:04,238
Where did it go wrong, exactly...

315
00:25:04,363 --> 00:25:05,513
you and Walt?

316
00:25:10,368 --> 00:25:12,818
I mean,
I always saw him as kind of...

317
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,473
mild-mannered.

318
00:25:19,138 --> 00:25:22,488
Something, I don't know,
changed when he got sick, or...?

319
00:25:24,802 --> 00:25:26,852
I don't know what changed, Ted,

320
00:25:27,648 --> 00:25:31,098
and I just don't feel really comfortable
talking about it.

321
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:32,659
Sorry.

322
00:25:34,588 --> 00:25:36,738
Just asking out of self-interest.

323
00:25:36,965 --> 00:25:39,069
Got to make sure
I don't make the same mistake.

324
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,070
I would be amazed.

325
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,262
Just let me see
if I'm following you here, Russell.

326
00:25:49,387 --> 00:25:53,893
You got this stuff
from some guy at Gasparza's

327
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:58,505
who was wearing tan pants
and who you're 80% sure

328
00:25:58,928 --> 00:26:00,178
had a mustache.

329
00:26:00,691 --> 00:26:02,041
That's it, right?

330
00:26:02,373 --> 00:26:05,223
That's your brain
working at maximum capacity?

331
00:26:12,985 --> 00:26:13,905
Russell.

332
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:17,101
Everything all right in there?

333
00:26:19,351 --> 00:26:20,351
Mel.

334
00:26:20,941 --> 00:26:22,641
The dude's name was Mel.

335
00:26:23,387 --> 00:26:25,087
Well, there you go. See?

336
00:26:25,306 --> 00:26:27,584
You served
an actual earthly function.

337
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:29,642
I can't believe I remembered that.

338
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:30,767
Mel who?

339
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,298
Does he have a last name?

340
00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:36,177
Mel.

341
00:26:37,939 --> 00:26:38,939
Wait.

342
00:26:40,676 --> 00:26:41,726
Was it Mel?

343
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:44,087
Mark.

344
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,762
It was definitely an "M" name.

345
00:26:47,887 --> 00:26:49,757
Man, I'm losing it.

346
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,469
Wait, wait.

347
00:26:54,704 --> 00:26:55,704
Yeah.

348
00:26:57,139 --> 00:26:58,139
It's gone.

349
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,700
It's gone.

350
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,910
It was an "M" name, though.

351
00:27:03,487 --> 00:27:05,635
I remember the "muh" sound.

352
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:10,842
We'll go with the "muh" sound.

353
00:27:12,501 --> 00:27:14,131
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah.

354
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,199
He definitely had tan pants.

355
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,674
Remind me to get a vasectomy.

356
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:24,802
It's after 9,
so this bar that Girl George is at,

357
00:27:24,927 --> 00:27:26,777
probably wall-to-wall
dirtbags by now.

358
00:27:26,902 --> 00:27:28,577
Let's go have a little looky-loo,

359
00:27:28,702 --> 00:27:31,252
see if we can't find
this M-named clown.

360
00:27:35,736 --> 00:27:36,736
What?

361
00:27:36,983 --> 00:27:38,083
It's a lead.

362
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,540
Lead to what?

363
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,000
To Heisenberg.

364
00:27:41,361 --> 00:27:44,757
I told you it was only a matter of time
before this guy booted up again.

365
00:27:44,882 --> 00:27:46,482
Here we go, my friend.

366
00:27:47,163 --> 00:27:49,037
Don't hate me
because I'm beautiful, Gomie.

367
00:27:49,162 --> 00:27:51,312
Just apologize and buy me a beer.

368
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,810
Man, you're reaching.

369
00:27:55,513 --> 00:27:59,213
This stuff could be a knockoff
or left over from an older cook.

370
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,050
How do you know
Heisenberg's gearing up again?

371
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,530
How do I know?

372
00:28:06,087 --> 00:28:07,337
Because I know.

373
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,440
I don't get it.

374
00:28:09,827 --> 00:28:12,993
This is the reason
why you're blowing off the task force?

375
00:28:13,273 --> 00:28:14,723
Chase down teeners?

376
00:28:16,117 --> 00:28:18,422
I'm getting tired
of all the second guessing.

377
00:28:19,376 --> 00:28:22,556
If you're not sufficiently stimulated
by this investigation,

378
00:28:23,104 --> 00:28:25,286
do us both a favor
and ask for a transfer.

379
00:28:25,743 --> 00:28:27,593
What is up with you lately?

380
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:29,597
Starting bar fights?

381
00:28:30,034 --> 00:28:31,584
Turning down El Paso?

382
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,294
And now this bullshit?

383
00:28:33,816 --> 00:28:35,931
Do you need to talk to someone
or what?

384
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:38,379
Talk to someone?

385
00:28:39,612 --> 00:28:40,712
Talk to who?

386
00:28:45,008 --> 00:28:47,099
I'm not trying
to step on your toes, bro.

387
00:28:49,288 --> 00:28:50,726
I'm just worried about you.

388
00:28:50,851 --> 00:28:52,897
- That's all.
- Appreciate that...

389
00:28:53,629 --> 00:28:54,629
bro.

390
00:28:56,122 --> 00:28:58,126
Now take your hand off my shoulder.

391
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,871
Yeah, the one that was on TV.

392
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,755
Did any little piece
fall on your property?

393
00:29:18,326 --> 00:29:21,363
I'm not looking
for an entire wing here, Mr. Linkas.

394
00:29:21,488 --> 00:29:22,850
It could be a nut or a bolt.

395
00:29:22,975 --> 00:29:24,619
It could be a bag of peanuts,

396
00:29:24,744 --> 00:29:28,036
just so long as it caused you pain
and suffering.

397
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:30,559
Closed.
Calling you back.

398
00:29:31,351 --> 00:29:32,561
You had your chance.

399
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,474
I told you to get him cooking again,
and you blew it off, now it's too late.

400
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,749
The guy's gone mass maniac on us!

401
00:29:38,296 --> 00:29:40,111
All I wanted was to show you two

402
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,988
your potential, and what do I get
in return? A bone contusion.

403
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:46,074
You want to see the scar?
I wish you two had...

404
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:48,375
Hi, there.

405
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,493
- How in the hell did you get Walt to...
- I made it.

406
00:29:53,401 --> 00:29:56,051
You know the guy
who knows the guy, right?

407
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:34,954
Good news is, for a stage three cancer,
the guy's doing well physically.

408
00:30:36,189 --> 00:30:38,239
Mentally, the guy's a disaster.

409
00:30:38,514 --> 00:30:41,264
He's gone off the rails
over this thing with his wife.

410
00:30:42,195 --> 00:30:44,784
My opinion, he's not coming back,

411
00:30:45,028 --> 00:30:46,278
not on his own.

412
00:30:50,713 --> 00:30:53,713
Your friends were at his place again,
by the way.

413
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:57,188
They drew something
on the street outside his house.

414
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,990
The scythe.

415
00:30:59,497 --> 00:31:00,497
Animals.

416
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:03,235
- Does the lawyer know?
- Should he?

417
00:31:07,277 --> 00:31:10,991
If you want this guy to produce again,
why not just tell him?

418
00:31:11,418 --> 00:31:13,970
You're the only thing that stands
between him and an ax in the head.

419
00:31:14,095 --> 00:31:16,336
I don't believe fear
to be an effective motivator.

420
00:31:16,715 --> 00:31:18,115
I want investment.

421
00:31:19,064 --> 00:31:21,864
For now,
I'm simply interested in time frame.

422
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,004
He will live
for the foreseeable future, yes?

423
00:31:25,965 --> 00:31:29,065
Foreseeable, couple years at least,
barring acts of God

424
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,590
and men with axes.

425
00:31:33,003 --> 00:31:35,234
From the lawyer,
I'm supposed to let you know

426
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:37,609
the Pinkman kid is looking to sell.

427
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,930
I don't work with junkies.

428
00:31:40,055 --> 00:31:41,803
That's what I thought you'd say.

429
00:31:41,928 --> 00:31:43,528
Probably for the best.

430
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,278
What I hear,
he and Walter are splitsville.

431
00:31:48,391 --> 00:31:49,391
Really?

432
00:31:49,554 --> 00:31:52,104
That's what Goodman says.
Cats and dogs.

433
00:31:55,605 --> 00:31:56,497
Do the deal.

434
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:27,737


435
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:25,375
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>

436
00:33:26,636 --> 00:33:27,869
<i>Agent Schrader,</i>

437
00:33:27,994 --> 00:33:30,424
<i>you need to be calling me back ASAP.</i>

438
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:33,619
<i>I've got Texas breathing down my neck,
and I'm not about...</i>

439
00:33:55,756 --> 00:33:58,223
Yeah, I haven't seen Matt
since my dad fired him,

440
00:33:58,348 --> 00:33:59,578
like, a while ago.

441
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,284
Where can I find him?

442
00:34:01,645 --> 00:34:04,893
- No idea. I haven't seen him...
- I know. You said that a few times.

443
00:34:05,018 --> 00:34:06,731
Because I haven't seen him.

444
00:34:06,994 --> 00:34:08,674
I don't know what else to say.

445
00:34:13,264 --> 00:34:14,676
What's your name, darling?

446
00:34:15,142 --> 00:34:16,142
Cara.

447
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:24,681
Where did this come from, Cara?

448
00:34:26,035 --> 00:34:27,435
I... I don't know.

449
00:34:28,721 --> 00:34:30,630
What is it?
Drugs?

450
00:34:33,955 --> 00:34:36,705
I'm just going to come right out
and say it.

451
00:34:37,582 --> 00:34:39,076
You're a bad liar, Cara.

452
00:34:40,352 --> 00:34:41,802
Don't get me wrong.

453
00:34:42,391 --> 00:34:44,341
Not the worst I've ever seen.

454
00:34:45,372 --> 00:34:48,822
Once had a guy try to explain
the dope balloon up his butt

455
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:50,969
on bad Thai food.
Still,

456
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:54,158
you're not a very good liar.

457
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,177
I honestly don't know.

458
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,345
Stop.

459
00:34:59,168 --> 00:35:00,918
You look like a good kid.

460
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:04,852
I'm not here to get you in trouble,
but tell me where this came from now!

461
00:35:10,482 --> 00:35:13,387
I never do stuff like this.
I swear to God.

462
00:35:15,264 --> 00:35:16,780
I tried it, and I hated it, so I...

463
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:19,675
- just gave it to Matt.
- And who gave it to you?

464
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,415
Some guy,
he came in a couple days ago

465
00:35:23,292 --> 00:35:26,942
- and wanted to trade it for gas.
- Some guy? What's his name?

466
00:35:30,384 --> 00:35:31,984
What did he look like?

467
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:35,238
I don't know.

468
00:35:36,106 --> 00:35:37,806
He looked pretty normal.

469
00:35:38,224 --> 00:35:39,624
You know? White...

470
00:35:43,912 --> 00:35:46,819
I think his hair was lightish brown.

471
00:35:48,517 --> 00:35:50,499
He had really blue eyes.

472
00:35:51,106 --> 00:35:53,028
They were really, really blue.

473
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:55,019
Yeah, he's dreamy.

474
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:57,546
What else?
Piercings,

475
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,816
jewelry,
distinctive articles of clothing?

476
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:00,941
Come on.

477
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:03,285
Come on.

478
00:36:05,394 --> 00:36:06,544
Listen to me.

479
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,849
It's real important that I find
the person that had these drugs,

480
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,879
so if you can remember
anything else...

481
00:36:14,894 --> 00:36:15,894
Come on.

482
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:16,966
Think.

483
00:36:22,654 --> 00:36:23,904
He drove an RV.

484
00:36:25,042 --> 00:36:26,517
Okay, good, good.

485
00:36:27,137 --> 00:36:29,411
What can you remember?
What kind of RV? What color?

486
00:36:29,536 --> 00:36:31,147
Did you spot a license plate?

487
00:36:32,327 --> 00:36:33,977
I don't know the kinds,

488
00:36:34,752 --> 00:36:36,702
and I didn't see the license,

489
00:36:38,693 --> 00:36:42,697
but the color was, I think,
white, brownish color.

490
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,305
I'm sorry.

491
00:36:48,137 --> 00:36:50,082
I know I'm not helping you, but...

492
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,474
Please don't tell my dad.

493
00:37:07,452 --> 00:37:08,652
Please tell me

494
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:11,293
that that camera works.

495
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:26,875
Dammit.

496
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:25,368
Bingo.

497
00:38:46,163 --> 00:38:47,913
These eggs are good, Mom.

498
00:38:49,191 --> 00:38:50,191
Thanks.

499
00:38:52,503 --> 00:38:53,956
You know what's weird?

500
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:55,374
Dad's website.

501
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:58,634
It's been three days
since the last donation.

502
00:39:00,926 --> 00:39:02,076
Yeah, well...

503
00:39:04,248 --> 00:39:05,798
people lose interest.

504
00:39:20,121 --> 00:39:22,021
So how long are you off for?

505
00:39:27,391 --> 00:39:28,491
A few weeks.

506
00:39:29,762 --> 00:39:31,312
We'll play it by ear.

507
00:39:34,756 --> 00:39:35,906
I probably...

508
00:39:37,272 --> 00:39:40,222
pushed it, you know,
going back to work so soon.

509
00:39:49,557 --> 00:39:51,722
Think I can get a ride today?

510
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,040
Louis has a doctor's appointment.

511
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,683
So Dad can babysit now.

512
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:07,613
Right?

513
00:40:08,879 --> 00:40:10,782
You won't have to take Holly to work

514
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:12,358
every day.

515
00:40:21,423 --> 00:40:23,470
Sometime, maybe.

516
00:40:26,608 --> 00:40:27,608
We'll see.

517
00:41:10,722 --> 00:41:11,722
What's up?

518
00:41:17,124 --> 00:41:19,374
I think you'll seriously enjoy, yo.

519
00:41:34,467 --> 00:41:35,467
Wait.

520
00:41:38,425 --> 00:41:39,425
No. Wait.

521
00:41:48,955 --> 00:41:51,883
- What the hell? This is only half.
- That's right.

522
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:53,471
It's your half.

523
00:41:57,796 --> 00:41:59,796
Where's the other half, bitch?

524
00:42:01,516 --> 00:42:02,891
I mean, it was...

525
00:42:03,367 --> 00:42:06,512
The whole thing was crazy, man.
Poor bastard. I felt sorry for him.

526
00:42:06,637 --> 00:42:09,681
He actually thought we were
the cable guys, you know?

527
00:42:12,018 --> 00:42:13,018
Anyway...

528
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:16,263
sorry about those miscalls, Chief.

529
00:42:16,388 --> 00:42:18,368
I'm changing providers.
It won't happen again.

530
00:42:20,013 --> 00:42:22,063
Are you going to El Paso, Hank?

531
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,540
Hell, yes!

532
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,828
With pointed boots and bells on.

533
00:42:26,146 --> 00:42:27,998
Just I got this break
in the Heisenberg case.

534
00:42:28,123 --> 00:42:29,462
The blue meth, you mean?

535
00:42:29,907 --> 00:42:30,957
The teenth?

536
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:33,525
That teenth got things rolling.

537
00:42:33,987 --> 00:42:37,134
I traced it to a gas station in Cibola.
That's where I got these.

538
00:42:37,374 --> 00:42:41,113
The station's... closed circuit,
was down... surprise, surprise...

539
00:42:41,238 --> 00:42:43,789
but I was able
to pull some of these snapshots

540
00:42:43,914 --> 00:42:45,764
off an ATM security camera.

541
00:42:46,515 --> 00:42:49,031
Now, I always thought these guys
might be camper cooking, right?

542
00:42:49,156 --> 00:42:50,066
First off,

543
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,149
your typical Class C
motor home is gonna

544
00:42:52,274 --> 00:42:54,587
grunt at least 5,000 pounds
of interior fixtures.

545
00:42:54,712 --> 00:42:58,408
We're talking appliances, furniture,
built-ins. 5,000 pounds at least, okay?

546
00:42:59,342 --> 00:43:01,244
See how high
that suspension's riding?

547
00:43:02,053 --> 00:43:04,956
No way, no how, this thing's
carrying that kind of weight.

548
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,084
I mean,
this thing has been cleared out

549
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:08,994
and stripped down
to its tight and curlies.

550
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,119
For what?

551
00:43:10,976 --> 00:43:12,026
Blood bank?

552
00:43:12,742 --> 00:43:14,192
Maybe a bookmobile?

553
00:43:15,967 --> 00:43:18,267
There's no clear view of the plates.

554
00:43:18,985 --> 00:43:21,357
Yeah, well,
you can only get so lucky, right?

555
00:43:21,482 --> 00:43:23,183
But the fact
that there's no front plate

556
00:43:23,308 --> 00:43:25,101
tells me its likely
New Mexico registration.

557
00:43:25,381 --> 00:43:26,496
I checked with DMV.

558
00:43:26,621 --> 00:43:30,625
There are only 29 of these early '80s
Bounders registered in the state.

559
00:43:33,264 --> 00:43:34,330
Only 29?

560
00:43:36,455 --> 00:43:39,039
So I got to go, you know,
knock on some doors.

561
00:43:47,426 --> 00:43:49,251
They need you in El Paso, Hank.

562
00:43:49,489 --> 00:43:50,639
You bet. I...

563
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,300
I'm just going to wrap up
this Heisenberg thing first.

564
00:43:53,425 --> 00:43:56,800
- So you're refusing the assignment.
- No, I'm not. I'll go. It's just...

565
00:43:57,362 --> 00:44:00,415
- I need some more time.
- You're not hearing me, Agent Schrader.

566
00:44:01,178 --> 00:44:02,628
You're out of time.

567
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,674
Are you going to El Paso now?

568
00:44:06,587 --> 00:44:07,587
Tonight?

569
00:44:12,487 --> 00:44:14,187
Just a simple yes or no.

570
00:44:24,655 --> 00:44:25,655
I can't.

571
00:44:28,872 --> 00:44:31,110
But that's only because

572
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,978
I'm really close
to something big here.

573
00:44:44,707 --> 00:44:46,357
Better get to it, then.

574
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:15,178
<i>This is KECA 480,
Albuquerque news radio.</i>

575
00:45:15,303 --> 00:45:17,517
<i>KECA news time 10:13.</i>

576
00:45:17,642 --> 00:45:18,995
<i>Our top story this hour...</i>

577
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,469
<i>Donald Margolis,

578
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:26,599

00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,208

580
00:45:29,333 --> 00:45:32,164

581
00:45:32,289 --> 00:45:34,093
<i>Police won't say whether or not...</i>

582
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,800
Your half.
