3
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,316
You got nothing on me.
All right, you can call my lawyer,

4
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,680
Saul Goodman.

5
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,908
Talk to my lawyer, all right?

6
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:47,494
You hear me. I got nothing to say.
I told you. You can call my...

7
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:54,495
You had my cell phone number!
You had my wife's name!

8
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,809
How'd you do it?

9
00:04:55,934 --> 00:04:58,422
Talk!
Who you working with?

10
00:06:20,915 --> 00:06:23,177
If you're ready to talk,

11
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,806
they want to get a statement.

12
00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:28,909
Your side of what happened here.

13
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,156
Or we can hold him off
till another time.

14
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:40,188
Maybe you'll want to talk
to a lawyer.

15
00:06:50,632 --> 00:06:51,732
There it is.

16
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,710
Yo, Adrian.

17
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:58,459
Rocky called.
He wants his face back.

18
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:02,237
Come on.
I got to cheer you up.

19
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:03,380
You see that?

20
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:07,135
That's your Get Out of Jail Free card.
You understand Get Out of Jail card?

21
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,431
Just blink once if you're following.

22
00:07:10,732 --> 00:07:12,252
The D.A.'s worst nightmare

23
00:07:12,377 --> 00:07:14,750
is that face out in public.

24
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,849
They're going to have to steer
a wide berth of young Master Pinkman

25
00:07:17,974 --> 00:07:21,483
for fear of the P.R. poop storm
that will rain down on them

26
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,429
if this story ever gets out.

27
00:07:23,554 --> 00:07:25,235
I mean, this beating?

28
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:27,201
Best thing for you.

29
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,073
You're home free.

30
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,600
Good, right?

31
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,702
Right.

32
00:07:56,388 --> 00:07:58,410
You're now officially
the cute one of the group.

33
00:07:58,535 --> 00:08:00,808
Paul, meet Ringo.
Ringo, Paul.

34
00:08:09,003 --> 00:08:10,653
I am so sorry for this.

35
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:13,408
This should not have happened.

36
00:08:15,507 --> 00:08:16,557
But it did.

37
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:19,647
No thanks to you.

38
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,060
But the plan did work.

39
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:29,536
We would have been locked up
right now if we didn't lure him away.

40
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:32,427
This, I just...

41
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:35,013
I never saw this coming.

42
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:46,817
What happens now?

43
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:48,601
What happens now?

44
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,528
I'll tell you what happens now.

45
00:08:53,672 --> 00:08:57,315
Your scumbag brother-in-law
is finished,

46
00:08:58,526 --> 00:08:59,526
done.

47
00:09:00,551 --> 00:09:01,498
You understand?

48
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,233
I will own him when this is over.

49
00:09:06,652 --> 00:09:08,874
Every cent he earns,

50
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:12,466
every cent his wife earns,

51
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:14,629
is mine.

52
00:09:16,117 --> 00:09:17,467
Anyplace he goes,

53
00:09:18,128 --> 00:09:19,828
anywhere he turns,

54
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:21,977
I'm going to be there,

55
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,351
grabbing my share.

56
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:29,621
He'll be scrubbing toilets
in Tijuana for pennies,

57
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,302
and I'll be standing over him

58
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,288
to get my cut.

59
00:09:35,862 --> 00:09:37,780
He'll see me when he wakes up
in the morning

60
00:09:37,905 --> 00:09:40,236
and when he crawls to sleep

61
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:42,884
in whatever rat hole's left for him

62
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:45,681
after I shred his house down,

63
00:09:47,522 --> 00:09:50,913
I will haunt his crusty ass

64
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:52,556
forever

65
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,750
until the day

66
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:58,586
he sticks a gun up his mouth

67
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:00,919
and pulls the trigger

68
00:10:01,696 --> 00:10:03,930
just to get me out of his head.

69
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:07,091
That's...

70
00:10:08,334 --> 00:10:10,851
what happens next.

71
00:10:19,106 --> 00:10:20,668
My advice...

72
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,861
that's probably not a good strategy.

73
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:28,961
They're scared of you right now.
They want nothing to do with you.

74
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,629
But if you hit them,

75
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:33,882
they're forced to hit back hard.

76
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,970
They will turn over every rock
hither, thither, and yon

77
00:10:38,354 --> 00:10:40,222
until someone spills
the beans on you

78
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,135
and anyone associated with you,

79
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,670
present company included.

80
00:10:43,795 --> 00:10:46,812
Yes, I think what Saul is saying
makes a lot of sense.

81
00:10:48,705 --> 00:10:50,804
Move on with your life.

82
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:53,389
Leave it behind, all of it.

83
00:10:53,514 --> 00:10:54,959
Nothing changes.

84
00:10:55,962 --> 00:10:57,662
Once I walk out of here,

85
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:02,636
I get myself a new RV
and go start cooking again.

86
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,894
How exactly do you think

87
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:09,939
you're going to get away with that?

88
00:11:10,064 --> 00:11:11,503
They will catch you.

89
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,671
So what?

90
00:11:13,862 --> 00:11:15,977
I have a Get Out of Jail Free card.

91
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:18,885
I may have overstated the...

92
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,804
the power of your face.

93
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,739
Not this.

94
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:26,268
If the cops catch me...

95
00:11:28,277 --> 00:11:30,627
I give them what they want the most.

96
00:11:35,802 --> 00:11:36,802
You.

97
00:11:42,211 --> 00:11:43,311
They nab me,

98
00:11:44,758 --> 00:11:45,908
I make a deal

99
00:11:46,994 --> 00:11:50,909
to give up the great Heisenberg

100
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:55,532
and his million-dollar drug ring.

101
00:11:59,897 --> 00:12:01,609
You're my free pass,

102
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,389
bitch.

103
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,396
You're so sure.

104
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:15,546
Look, if he didn't give up my name
while Hank was beating him senseless,

105
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:17,069
he's never going to talk.

106
00:12:17,574 --> 00:12:19,805
What do you think that was
in there, a bluff?

107
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,573
He wants your brother-in-law.

108
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,745
And there's going to be a many lawyers
creaming their underoos for this case.

109
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,485
I'd take it myself if it wouldn't
cause so much collateral damage.

110
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,210
And him cooking again.

111
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:33,956
When, not if, he gets caught,

112
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:35,462
and he's facing 20 years,

113
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,628
what'll he do then?
Believe me,

114
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:40,092
there's no honor among thieves.

115
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:43,109
Except for us, of course.

116
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:45,734
No, he'll...

117
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,608
He'll come around.

118
00:12:49,754 --> 00:12:50,919
And if he doesn't,

119
00:12:51,044 --> 00:12:53,355
there may come a time
to talk options.

120
00:12:53,954 --> 00:12:55,107
Options?

121
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:11,948
I'm convinced that Mr. Pinkman
was involved in the manufacture

122
00:13:12,073 --> 00:13:14,257
and distribution
of phenyl-2 methamphetamine,

123
00:13:14,382 --> 00:13:16,582
specifically what we're calling
the blue meth.

124
00:13:17,337 --> 00:13:19,378
I tracked him to a scrap yard

125
00:13:19,503 --> 00:13:21,945
where he stored
an early '80s camper,

126
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,070
an RV.

127
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,709
While waiting for a warrant
to search this vehicle,

128
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:29,484
which I believed to be
a rolling meth lab,

129
00:13:29,969 --> 00:13:31,819
I received a telephone call

130
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:34,646
telling me my wife Marie

131
00:13:35,005 --> 00:13:37,105
had been injured in an accident.

132
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,334
Upon hearing the news,

133
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,541
I left Mr. Pinkman and his vehicle

134
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,116
to tend to my wife.

135
00:13:44,507 --> 00:13:47,742
After arriving at the hospital,
I learned the emergency call was a hoax.

136
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:51,070
My wife, fortunately, was unharmed.

137
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,452
So I immediately went back
to the salvage yard,

138
00:13:56,577 --> 00:13:58,077
but the RV was gone.

139
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,404
Most likely destroyed on site.

140
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,217
And it was at this point that you drove
to the home of Jesse Pinkman?

141
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:17,939
I think we're done here.

142
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,257
Agent Schrader needs to get home,

143
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:21,902
get some rest.

144
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,170
That's fine.

145
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:24,919
But just to confirm,

146
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,575
- you're taking the Fifth here?
- Yeah. That's correct.

147
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,420
We just want
to give you all a heads up.

148
00:14:33,946 --> 00:14:36,772
Mr. Pinkman is pressing charges
in this matter.

149
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,210
He's given a detailed version

150
00:14:39,335 --> 00:14:41,758
of events as he sees them.

151
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:45,087
- The word of a meth head.
- We know all about his history.

152
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:46,562
We're well aware,

153
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:49,462
but toxicology on Pinkman...

154
00:14:49,903 --> 00:14:51,819
his blood is clean, he's not using.

155
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:55,503
The kid is even refusing
his doctor-ordered pain meds,

156
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,270
as far as we can tell.

157
00:15:03,705 --> 00:15:05,455
Where do we go from here?

158
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,329
A couple of gentlemen
from OPR will come down,

159
00:15:08,454 --> 00:15:10,353
probably tomorrow morning.

160
00:15:10,478 --> 00:15:12,452
Janice will give us
an exact time on that.

161
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:15,881
And you men will be
continuing your investigation.

162
00:15:18,623 --> 00:15:20,370
- Thanks for your time.
- Right.

163
00:15:20,495 --> 00:15:23,213
We just need one more thing.

164
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,882
Photo of Agent Schrader's hands,

165
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,970
for the record.

166
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,890
Yes, of course.

167
00:15:31,803 --> 00:15:33,682
Bandage off, if you would.

168
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,738
On the table is fine.

169
00:15:42,503 --> 00:15:44,303
Flat on the table is fine.

170
00:17:25,714 --> 00:17:27,166
It's all going to work out.

171
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,241
You've been too good to them
for too many years.

172
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:33,450
I hope it goes without saying
that we're not

173
00:17:33,575 --> 00:17:35,875
talking to anybody about this, okay?

174
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,761
Marie, who?

175
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,590
Do you have a minute?

176
00:18:23,713 --> 00:18:24,713
Sure.

177
00:18:39,674 --> 00:18:41,324
I guess crime does pay.

178
00:18:46,214 --> 00:18:49,043
I don't suppose you just came by
to insult me.

179
00:18:52,772 --> 00:18:54,072
We need to talk.

180
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,726
You heard about Hank?

181
00:18:57,895 --> 00:19:01,431
About what happened
with this Jesse Pinkman?

182
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,283
Yes, I know.

183
00:19:04,132 --> 00:19:06,232
Whatever Hank was investigating,

184
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,919
him trying to find an RV,

185
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:12,119
is there any danger

186
00:19:12,644 --> 00:19:14,819
that could lead back to you?

187
00:19:17,803 --> 00:19:19,073
Why would it?

188
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:24,746
Is this why you're here?

189
00:19:26,754 --> 00:19:28,249
I'm here to talk about Hank.

190
00:19:31,157 --> 00:19:34,933
You know what's going to happen to him
if this Pinkman presses charges?

191
00:19:38,054 --> 00:19:39,904
Hank could lose everything.

192
00:19:43,421 --> 00:19:45,034
I thought maybe...

193
00:19:47,499 --> 00:19:49,397
There's a way you could help him.

194
00:19:50,305 --> 00:19:51,305
How?

195
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,306
Contact Pinkman.

196
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:56,965
Get him to drop the charges.

197
00:19:57,424 --> 00:19:59,459
Look, I don't know
what kind of relationship

198
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:01,711
you picture me having
with this person.

199
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:02,907
I'm not asking.

200
00:20:04,748 --> 00:20:06,120
He's not my friend.

201
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,984
I mean,
it's not as if we were even close.

202
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:10,675
I'm not asking.

203
00:20:11,314 --> 00:20:13,514
But there must be something
you could say.

204
00:20:14,738 --> 00:20:16,538
Isn't it even worth a try?

205
00:20:18,055 --> 00:20:19,555
Hank is your family.

206
00:20:23,494 --> 00:20:24,973
Not currently.

207
00:20:26,914 --> 00:20:28,464
I said not currently.

208
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:33,200
I'm late. I have to go.

209
00:21:08,023 --> 00:21:10,023
I was starting to get worried.

210
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,516
Car trouble.

211
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:16,774
That's a bummer.

212
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:20,450
You should call me next time.
I'll pick you up.

213
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,942
No sandals today?

214
00:21:28,575 --> 00:21:29,913
I just thought...

215
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:33,138
a bit more professional.

216
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:37,170
Everything is on track.

217
00:21:39,685 --> 00:21:41,841
We got our distillate.
Just waiting to...

218
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,613
Let's get our trays ready.

219
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,720
Clean, no moisture.

220
00:21:45,845 --> 00:21:46,602
Done.

221
00:21:50,397 --> 00:21:51,524
Is our...

222
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:54,312
Our solvent filtered?

223
00:21:55,058 --> 00:21:56,896
I thought you might ask that.

224
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:57,774
Done.

225
00:22:00,494 --> 00:22:01,594
That's good.

226
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,404
That's good.

227
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,333
Hand in glove.
That's what we strive for.

228
00:22:08,778 --> 00:22:09,778
You know,

229
00:22:10,707 --> 00:22:13,122
this might be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

230
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,115
So, you the gentlemen?

231
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,686
Lucky you. I got a load to pick up.
I'm taking the 40 through to Memphis.

232
00:22:54,811 --> 00:22:57,212
I could hammer it out in about 15,
but there's a girl down there.

233
00:22:57,337 --> 00:22:59,236
Lainie or Lolly or something.
Maybe Fran.

234
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:01,857
She's got one of these fetish things.
Wants to get peed on.

235
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:04,966
I was hoping to see her tonight,
but she wants to sleep before 10.

236
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,032
So I want to wrap it up here ASAP

237
00:23:07,157 --> 00:23:09,637
because traffic can be a wild card,
rubbernecking and such.

238
00:23:10,709 --> 00:23:11,968
The surprising thing is

239
00:23:12,093 --> 00:23:14,938
women who like to get peed on always
tend to be from the warmer climates.

240
00:23:15,063 --> 00:23:18,015
You'd think the ones in the colder
zones would be more inclined.

241
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,730
Maybe it's a shock to the system
if the body's not properly acclimated,

242
00:23:20,855 --> 00:23:24,328
but, you know, I leave that
for smarter minds than me.

243
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:26,803
Science is a mystery.

244
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,310
Take a gander.

245
00:23:29,673 --> 00:23:31,783
Prices are negotiable.
A bulk gets you a discount.

246
00:23:31,908 --> 00:23:34,655
I'm running a special
on these little honeys.

247
00:23:36,132 --> 00:23:39,591
JHPs. Hollow-point bullets,
known by the natives as Black Death.

248
00:23:39,716 --> 00:23:42,541
Check it out. You like that?
So sweet, you want to lick it.

249
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,992
Nickel-plated brass casing,
Lubalox coat for panache.

250
00:23:45,117 --> 00:23:47,757
Sucker has six razor claws
that expand upon impact.

251
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:50,303
Shred your mama's head
like a cabbage.

252
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,264
Keep it. On the house?

253
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:56,225
I've been windjamming long enough.
Tell me what you're looking for?

254
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,102
What do you need?
What can I do you for?

255
00:23:58,714 --> 00:23:59,562
Vests.

256
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,713
Vests?

257
00:24:00,838 --> 00:24:02,588
Hell, yeah, we got vests.

258
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:04,099
Right here.

259
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:09,678
Sleek, comfortable,

260
00:24:09,803 --> 00:24:12,108
thermally bonded
non-interwoven Kevlar fiber.

261
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:14,378
Stop a bullet like a soft wank
against a Quaker girl.

262
00:24:14,503 --> 00:24:16,109
Just ain't getting through.

263
00:24:16,234 --> 00:24:17,397
And lightweight?

264
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,749
Damn, so lightweight,
you'll forget you're wearing it.

265
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:22,752
They work?

266
00:24:23,606 --> 00:24:25,206
Sure as shit, they do.

267
00:24:25,914 --> 00:24:27,914
I don't leave home without it.

268
00:24:35,922 --> 00:24:37,122
What the hell?

269
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:42,185
You broke my freakin' rib,
you maniac son of a bitch.

270
00:25:13,622 --> 00:25:14,872
You're welcome!

271
00:25:34,243 --> 00:25:36,396
What temperature did you set here?

272
00:25:36,521 --> 00:25:37,521
There?

273
00:25:38,346 --> 00:25:40,298
Station Five... 75 C.

274
00:25:43,654 --> 00:25:45,163
I said 85.

275
00:25:46,098 --> 00:25:47,086
8-5.

276
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:53,594
I wrote it down.
You said 75.

277
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,137
- I wrote it.
- Then you wrote it wrong.

278
00:25:56,478 --> 00:25:59,390
That's not what I said.
I said 85.

279
00:25:59,953 --> 00:26:02,810
It's always been 85...

280
00:26:03,332 --> 00:26:06,200
not 75, not 95.

281
00:26:06,674 --> 00:26:07,732
85.

282
00:26:08,244 --> 00:26:10,910
This is chemistry.
Degrees matter.

283
00:26:15,434 --> 00:26:16,490
I'm sorry.

284
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,580
I'm very sorry.

285
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:20,968
Great. You're sorry.

286
00:26:21,093 --> 00:26:24,429
Meanwhile, you've just brewed
50 gallons of useless sludge.

287
00:26:24,554 --> 00:26:25,750
Congratulations.

288
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:28,294
Just dump it. Dump it all.

289
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,012
This batch is ruined.

290
00:27:03,646 --> 00:27:04,846
You look nice.

291
00:27:07,343 --> 00:27:09,243
I look like a TV weatherman.

292
00:27:11,678 --> 00:27:13,078
You want a coffee?

293
00:27:16,305 --> 00:27:17,305
Nah.

294
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:23,201
I squeezed some orange juice.
You want a glass of orange juice?

295
00:27:24,537 --> 00:27:25,737
I'm all right.

296
00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:35,166
What are you going to tell them?

297
00:27:40,089 --> 00:27:42,167
Here's what you're
going to tell them.

298
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:44,304
He attacked you.

299
00:27:45,676 --> 00:27:46,785
He attacked me?

300
00:27:47,482 --> 00:27:49,532
He swung at you with something.

301
00:27:51,275 --> 00:27:52,908
Attacked you with a pipe.

302
00:27:53,033 --> 00:27:54,475
With a pipe?

303
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,037
It happened fast.
He resisted arrest,

304
00:27:59,753 --> 00:28:03,139
and muscle memory kicked in,
and you had to disarm him.

305
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:04,507
Muscle memory.

306
00:28:05,404 --> 00:28:07,148
Yes.
It happens all the time.

307
00:28:07,273 --> 00:28:10,589
Years of training, and your body
acted faster than your brain.

308
00:28:10,714 --> 00:28:12,510
You had no choice but to hit him.

309
00:28:12,635 --> 00:28:14,025
You had to fight back...

310
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,324
I'm not going to go in there
and lie.

311
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:25,496
It's some lowlife degenerate
versus you...

312
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:29,181
Doing the job you're supposed to.

313
00:28:31,275 --> 00:28:33,475
Why should you be the one who pays

314
00:28:33,788 --> 00:28:35,618
for doing the right thing?

315
00:28:35,743 --> 00:28:38,043
Oh, baby, it wasn't the right thing.

316
00:28:39,455 --> 00:28:41,205
It's not what the job is.

317
00:28:42,707 --> 00:28:45,007
I'm supposed to be better than that.

318
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:48,766
And you made one mistake.

319
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:53,416
No, it wasn't one mistake.
I've been...

320
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,407
I've been...

321
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:03,160
unraveling, you know?

322
00:29:07,728 --> 00:29:09,778
I don't sleep at night anymore.

323
00:29:11,745 --> 00:29:12,745
I freeze.

324
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:14,985
I freeze up.

325
00:29:17,477 --> 00:29:20,299
My chest gets all tight.
I can't breathe.

326
00:29:24,677 --> 00:29:25,677
I panic.

327
00:29:29,531 --> 00:29:31,631
Ever since that Salamanca thing.

328
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,443
Tuco Salamanca.

329
00:29:34,568 --> 00:29:37,898
If ever a scumbag deserved
a bullet between the eyes.

330
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:44,809
It changed me.

331
00:29:50,227 --> 00:29:52,277
And I can't seem to control it.

332
00:29:56,482 --> 00:29:57,982
I tried to fight it.

333
00:30:01,144 --> 00:30:03,923
But then El Paso.

334
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:07,985
And it's just gotten worse.

335
00:30:11,974 --> 00:30:13,845
What I did to Pinkman...

336
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:19,916
that's not who I'm supposed to be.
That's not me.

337
00:30:23,618 --> 00:30:24,668
All this...

338
00:30:26,849 --> 00:30:28,699
everything that's happened,

339
00:30:30,618 --> 00:30:33,499
I swear to God, Marie,
I think the universe

340
00:30:34,778 --> 00:30:36,828
is trying to tell me something,

341
00:30:37,095 --> 00:30:38,495
and I'm finally...

342
00:30:40,446 --> 00:30:41,746
ready to listen.

343
00:30:50,234 --> 00:30:52,634
I'm just not the man
I thought I was.

344
00:30:56,637 --> 00:30:58,437
I think I'm done as a cop.

345
00:31:10,051 --> 00:31:12,181
Now, this is not an easy decision,

346
00:31:12,306 --> 00:31:15,262
but it is one that I have to make.

347
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:16,708
I'm sorry.

348
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:18,694
This whole...

349
00:31:19,547 --> 00:31:21,322
Gale situation...

350
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:24,391
He's just not working out.

351
00:31:28,045 --> 00:31:29,045
Yes. Now.

352
00:31:30,512 --> 00:31:33,183
It may sound unorthodox,

353
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,358
but I think

354
00:31:34,872 --> 00:31:38,260
our first best option...

355
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,741
Is Jesse Pinkman.

356
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,890
No, look. There's...

357
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:00,731
There's a shorthand
that exists between us...

358
00:32:00,856 --> 00:32:02,306
experience together

359
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:05,163
at a level that, quite frankly,

360
00:32:05,288 --> 00:32:07,838
I'm just never going to reach
with Gale.

361
00:32:12,787 --> 00:32:14,821
Look, Mr. Fring,

362
00:32:16,391 --> 00:32:18,024
when I accepted your offer,

363
00:32:18,149 --> 00:32:21,350
I was told the lab is mine.

364
00:32:21,812 --> 00:32:23,812
And I know best how to run it.

365
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:30,699
Thank you.

366
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,213
Thank you.
Yes, I will. I will.

367
00:32:37,136 --> 00:32:38,136
Good-bye.

368
00:32:45,701 --> 00:32:47,464
Listen, something's come up.

369
00:32:49,515 --> 00:32:51,615
I think it's a good opportunity.

370
00:32:54,456 --> 00:32:56,622
There's been a job opening.

371
00:32:57,647 --> 00:32:59,059
I need a new lab assistant.

372
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:03,858
I already did my time.

373
00:33:05,202 --> 00:33:07,359
Why don't you just go
get yourself a monkey?

374
00:33:08,845 --> 00:33:11,875
I don't want a monkey.
I want you.

375
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,701
Oh, gee, thanks.

376
00:33:15,632 --> 00:33:17,745
Well, not interested.

377
00:33:18,742 --> 00:33:20,039
I got my own thing

378
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,207
going on.

379
00:33:22,063 --> 00:33:23,159
Nice try

380
00:33:23,742 --> 00:33:26,003
saving your ass head brother-in-law.

381
00:33:30,482 --> 00:33:32,607
That's not why I'm here, Jesse.

382
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,328
There's more.

383
00:33:36,128 --> 00:33:38,028
It's more than an assistant.

384
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:41,060
Partners.

385
00:33:42,731 --> 00:33:44,546
We'll be partners again.

386
00:33:44,671 --> 00:33:47,449
Split everything 50-50,
just like before.

387
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:54,038
$1.5 million each.

388
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,298
- I don't think you heard...
- I've heard...

389
00:34:11,854 --> 00:34:12,854
you fine.

390
00:34:14,926 --> 00:34:16,107
I said no.

391
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:21,575
Let me understand this.

392
00:34:22,926 --> 00:34:25,896
You're turning down $1.5 million.

393
00:34:26,758 --> 00:34:30,200
I am not turning down the money.

394
00:34:30,576 --> 00:34:33,330
I am turning down you.

395
00:34:34,057 --> 00:34:35,237
You get it?

396
00:34:36,276 --> 00:34:39,306
I want nothing to do with you.

397
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:43,457
Ever since I met you,

398
00:34:44,312 --> 00:34:47,995
everything I have ever cared about

399
00:34:48,783 --> 00:34:49,954
is gone...

400
00:34:51,253 --> 00:34:54,259
Ruined, turned to shit,

401
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:59,214
dead, ever since I hooked up
with the great Heisenberg.

402
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,925
I have never been more alone.

403
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,250
I have nothing!

404
00:35:08,114 --> 00:35:09,346
No one!

405
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:13,068
All right?
It's all gone!

406
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,411
Get it?

407
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:19,507
Why...

408
00:35:21,094 --> 00:35:24,491
Why would you get it?

409
00:35:24,867 --> 00:35:28,049
What do you even care
as long as you...

410
00:35:28,174 --> 00:35:30,412
get what you want?

411
00:35:31,471 --> 00:35:32,588
Right?

412
00:35:33,003 --> 00:35:36,952
You don't give a shit about me.

413
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:41,560
You said I was no good.

414
00:35:43,062 --> 00:35:44,384
I'm nothing!

415
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:48,172
Why would you want me?

416
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:53,027
You said my meth is inferior,

417
00:35:53,506 --> 00:35:54,318
right?

418
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:55,883
Right?

419
00:35:57,013 --> 00:36:00,115
You said my cook was garbage!

420
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,432
Screw you, man!

421
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:12,466
Your meth is good, Jesse.

422
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,960
As good as mine.

423
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,545
<i>50-50.</i>

424
00:37:20,858 --> 00:37:22,281
Yes. 50-50.

425
00:37:27,475 --> 00:37:28,473
Partners.

426
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:36,371
Good.

427
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,970
This is the statement
you want to give?

428
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:28,869
Yes, sir.

429
00:38:30,663 --> 00:38:32,504
Hank, you don't have to do this.

430
00:38:34,914 --> 00:38:35,914
I do.

431
00:38:37,534 --> 00:38:38,534
I'm good.

432
00:38:42,517 --> 00:38:46,426
So we understand if we write it up
like that, you'll sign it.

433
00:38:49,232 --> 00:38:51,082
That's the way it happened.

434
00:38:52,126 --> 00:38:53,956
I accept the consequences.

435
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:01,963
In the light of these facts...

436
00:39:03,197 --> 00:39:05,425
As of this moment,
you're suspended without pay.

437
00:39:06,127 --> 00:39:09,427
I have to ask you to hand over
your badge and your gun.

438
00:39:10,142 --> 00:39:11,142
Yes, sir.

439
00:39:43,953 --> 00:39:44,953
Hold up.

440
00:39:45,434 --> 00:39:46,434
Yes, sir?

441
00:39:47,746 --> 00:39:49,428
I just want to tell you something.

442
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:51,833
And to be clear,
you didn't hear it from me.

443
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:53,724
I don't want you
to get your hopes up,

444
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:56,935
but the word in the pipeline is
Pinkman isn't pressing charges.

445
00:39:58,821 --> 00:39:59,646
Why not?

446
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,435
Who the hell knows?

447
00:40:03,029 --> 00:40:05,129
Maybe you have a guardian angel.

448
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:28,742
It went fine.

449
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:33,555
Well, fine means what it means.
Yeah.

450
00:40:36,798 --> 00:40:39,102
I'll tell you all about it
when I get home, okay?

451
00:40:45,066 --> 00:40:46,783
I don't know, baby.
I just think...

452
00:40:46,908 --> 00:40:48,558
I think we may be okay.

453
00:40:51,204 --> 00:40:52,574
Okay. I love you, too.

454
00:41:14,695 --> 00:41:17,251
<i>I need you to listen very carefully.</i>

455
00:41:17,376 --> 00:41:19,184
<i>Two men are coming to kill you.</i>

456
00:41:19,946 --> 00:41:20,879
Come again?

457
00:41:21,004 --> 00:41:22,912
<i>They're approaching your car.</i>

458
00:41:23,037 --> 00:41:24,537
<i>You have one minute.</i>

459
00:41:25,432 --> 00:41:27,957
I don't get the gag, jerk off.
Who is this?

460
00:41:28,082 --> 00:41:29,332
<i>They're coming.</i>

461
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:52,205
Gomie, I don't know
what that call's supposed to be,

462
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,969
but it's dumb
even by your standards,

463
00:41:55,335 --> 00:41:57,102
so call me when you get this.
