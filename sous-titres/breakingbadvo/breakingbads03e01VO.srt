00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,380
<i>We interrupt our scheduled programming
to bring you breaking news.</i>

4
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,657
Good afternoon.
In the last several minutes,

5
00:04:18,782 --> 00:04:21,158
KOB has received dozens of reports

6
00:04:21,353 --> 00:04:23,577
of what appears to be
a crashed aircraft,

7
00:04:23,702 --> 00:04:26,852
possibly two aircraft...
on Albuquerque's east side.

8
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:28,681
As of yet, details are scarce,

9
00:04:28,806 --> 00:04:31,804
but callers describe witnessing
an explosion overhead,

10
00:04:31,929 --> 00:04:33,427
followed by falling debris.

11
00:04:34,101 --> 00:04:37,647
... crash investigators with
the National Transportation Safety Board

12
00:04:37,772 --> 00:04:40,622
are expected
on-site as early as this evening.

13
00:04:40,896 --> 00:04:43,671
But officials warn that,
with a debris field of this magnitude,

14
00:04:43,796 --> 00:04:46,336
the investigation
and the clean-up may well stretch...

15
00:04:46,461 --> 00:04:50,146
... the Boeing 737
was being re-routed or vectored

16
00:04:50,271 --> 00:04:52,536
through the airspace,
which is standard procedure,

17
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:54,335
according to a spokesman
for the FAA.

18
00:04:54,915 --> 00:04:57,221
<i>The eight-seat King Air 350</i>

19
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,882
<i>was a charter flight operating
out of Saint George, Utah,</i>

20
00:05:00,605 --> 00:05:02,259
<i>bound for Amarillo, Texas.</i>

21
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,977
It sounded like hail.

22
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,856
Like heavy hailstones.

23
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:07,449
It was just...

24
00:05:08,806 --> 00:05:10,684
bump-bump-bump
all over the neighborhood.

25
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:15,522
... indicating that the final
death toll now stands at 167.

26
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,510
... 167.

27
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,184
This mid-air collision
has left many wondering

28
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:24,077
how such an accident
could take place

29
00:05:24,202 --> 00:05:25,950
in a system with so many safeguards.

30
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,912
Allegations continue that the collision
which brought down Flight 515

31
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,206
was caused by improper
air traffic control.

32
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,480
The bombshell confirmation
out of Oklahoma City today,

33
00:05:35,605 --> 00:05:38,087
as the FAA confirmed,
it was, indeed,

34
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,756
a lone air traffic controller's
fateful mistake...

35
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,895
... is Donald Margolis,

36
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,388
a 19-year veteran of the FAA's

37
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:50,724
<i>Air Route Traffic Control Center
in Albuquerque.</i>

38
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,922
... Margolis recently
returned to work

39
00:05:53,047 --> 00:05:54,847
after a five-week absence,

40
00:05:54,972 --> 00:05:57,064
which was due to,
quote, "a personal loss".

41
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,565
While it's now known

42
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,151
<i>that Margolis had recently
lost a daughter...</i>

43
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,973
<i>... to a drug overdose
a month before.</i>

44
00:06:03,098 --> 00:06:06,124
<i>His troubled daughter
Jane Margolis, aged 26,</i>

45
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:07,963
<i>apparently had a long history</i>

46
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:09,538
<i>of substance abuse.</i>

47
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,202
<i>Friends of the family say
the death of his only child</i>

48
00:06:12,327 --> 00:06:14,616
<i>hit Margolis particularly hard.</i>

49
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:17,716
<i>Coming as it did little more
than a month before,</i>

50
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:21,279
<i>many are questioning
the timing of his return to work,</i>

51
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:23,471
<i>and are wondering
how much blame truly lies</i>

52
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:25,718
<i>with those who let
this grieving father...</i>

53
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:19,456
I usually open

54
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,353
with "So sorry you're here."

55
00:08:21,664 --> 00:08:23,664
Where would you like to begin?

56
00:08:24,198 --> 00:08:25,848
I really just need this

57
00:08:26,081 --> 00:08:28,340
quick and easy, you know?
As quick as...

58
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,364
something like this can be.

59
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,270
Is that mutual?
Does your husband go along with that?

60
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:40,062
Does he know?

61
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:43,763
I mean, he certainly knows
we're separated, so...

62
00:08:44,267 --> 00:08:45,617
Has he moved out?

63
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:49,153
We're in the process of moving him out.
Yeah. Today, hopefully.

64
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,121
And in the meantime, my...

65
00:08:51,362 --> 00:08:53,323
my son and my daughter

66
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,350
and I are staying with my sister.

67
00:08:55,475 --> 00:08:57,035
So you've moved out?

68
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:01,547
Yes, just temporarily,
only so he could get his things.

69
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,794
That was supposed
to happen last week,

70
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,980
but then came the crash, and...

71
00:09:06,105 --> 00:09:08,589
- God. You weren't one of the...
- Right...

72
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,107
Right beneath the flight path.

73
00:09:12,882 --> 00:09:16,192
We had debris land in our yard

74
00:09:16,317 --> 00:09:18,540
- and all of our neighborhood, so...
- Terrible.

75
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:20,115
Apparently, even...

76
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:21,762
you know,

77
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,327
parts of bodies, and so...

78
00:09:24,604 --> 00:09:27,886
I certainly
couldn't bring myself to...

79
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,126
- So awful.
- I know.

80
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:32,076
Anyway, I was certainly

81
00:09:32,201 --> 00:09:34,031
not ready to move back,
but it's time.

82
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,199
And...

83
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:39,119
I'm sure we're driving my sister
and her husband up a wall.

84
00:09:39,752 --> 00:09:41,819
You definitely want
to maintain residency

85
00:09:41,944 --> 00:09:43,123
in your actual home.

86
00:09:43,248 --> 00:09:46,798
It just puts you in a better position
in regards to custody.

87
00:09:47,161 --> 00:09:48,212
Two children?

88
00:09:49,526 --> 00:09:51,676
Holly here, and then I have a son

89
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:53,239
in high school...

90
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:54,773
Walter Junior.

91
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:58,555
They need to stay with me.

92
00:10:00,869 --> 00:10:03,611
- How long have you been married?
- Sixteen years.

93
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:06,688
And it's not an apartment.
It's a house that you live in?

94
00:10:07,777 --> 00:10:10,527
Do you own outright?
Do you have a mortgage?

95
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,405
There's definitely a mortgage.
We have...

96
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,197
maybe 15 years on it.

97
00:10:15,645 --> 00:10:17,143
What about other debts

98
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:18,509
or assets?

99
00:10:18,764 --> 00:10:20,619
Do you feel
you have a good understanding

100
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:23,038
of you and your husband's
financial situation?

101
00:10:27,186 --> 00:10:29,336
- Is your husband employed?
- Here's the thing.

102
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:32,384
I'm really not looking
for any, sort of...

103
00:10:33,358 --> 00:10:34,608
loopholes or...

104
00:10:34,878 --> 00:10:36,385
- I don't know... just...
- No.

105
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:37,811
No loopholes.

106
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,780
I just intend

107
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:43,057
that every one of my clients
get a full and honest accounting

108
00:10:43,182 --> 00:10:44,782
of what it is they owe

109
00:10:44,907 --> 00:10:46,607
and what it is they own.

110
00:10:47,435 --> 00:10:49,027
To that end, I say

111
00:10:49,504 --> 00:10:51,316
let's leave no stone unturned.

112
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,119
You'd be amazed what I've seen
partners hide from one another.

113
00:11:47,404 --> 00:11:49,291
There you are.
Listen, I...

114
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:50,766
You know, well...

115
00:11:51,866 --> 00:11:52,866
It's...

116
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,110
It's time.

117
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,674
The shittiest week since 9/11, okay?

118
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:06,184
Bar none. Yeah, this is it.
Hands down, we're living it.

119
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,874
I speak with some authority
because we had some shitty weeks

120
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:10,312
in the past few months.

121
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,169
But this here, call, you know...

122
00:12:12,294 --> 00:12:14,532
call freakin' the Guinness
Book of World Records...

123
00:12:14,657 --> 00:12:16,465
Call freakin'...
Am I talking too much?

124
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,298
I am, right? I am.
I know. Look.

125
00:12:18,423 --> 00:12:20,509
But this situation
between you and...

126
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:22,991
I'm not asking, by the way.

127
00:12:23,384 --> 00:12:26,775
It's none of my business.
I do not want to get in the middle.

128
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,663
I'm just saying...
Listen, okay?

129
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:31,329
You beat a little tactical retreat.

130
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:32,717
And regroup.

131
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:34,363
And then... bong.

132
00:12:35,776 --> 00:12:37,276
Absence makes the...

133
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,432
I'm pulling for you.

134
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:56,024
- No heavy lifting. I got it.
- No, it's okay.

135
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:57,376
I got it.

136
00:12:58,357 --> 00:12:59,357
Jesus.

137
00:13:00,242 --> 00:13:02,197
What do you got in there,
cinder blocks?

138
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:07,217
Half a million in cash.

139
00:13:13,522 --> 00:13:14,922
That's the spirit.

140
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,206
I got it. I got it.

141
00:13:40,909 --> 00:13:42,779
Who's here for self-improvement?

142
00:13:44,613 --> 00:13:46,763
Come on, give me a show of hands.

143
00:13:48,012 --> 00:13:50,145
Who among you is here hoping

144
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,888
they can actively
improve who they are?

145
00:13:58,847 --> 00:13:59,647
Right.

146
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:02,451
See, that's your first mistake.

147
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,259
You should be here
to learn self-acceptance.

148
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:14,978
Honey, you...

149
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,855
You want another waffle?

150
00:14:17,894 --> 00:14:21,705
I still got the iron out.
I could cut up some bananas.

151
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,064
<i>Hi, you're reached Walt,
Skyler, Flynn, and Holly.</i>

152
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:28,904
<i>Please leave us a message.</i>

153
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,738
<i>Hey. Hello, everybody.
Good morning.</i>

154
00:14:32,863 --> 00:14:34,310
<i>I was just checking in</i>

155
00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:37,924
<i>and thought I'd pass along
the current contact information.</i>

156
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,651
<i>I mean, certainly,
you can always reach me on my cell.</i>

157
00:14:40,776 --> 00:14:42,756
<i>I've always got that on me.
But in terms of...</i>

158
00:14:43,353 --> 00:14:44,640
<i>a mailing address,</i>

159
00:14:45,163 --> 00:14:47,063
<i>I'm here at The Beachcomber.</i>

160
00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:49,385
<i>And you know what?
It's actually very nice.</i>

161
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,695
<i>It's very pleasant.</i>

162
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:54,112
<i>Not as high end as the Oakwood,
but, you know, not as corporate...</i>

163
00:14:54,237 --> 00:14:55,937
Would you please just...

164
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,462
Hey, Dad. It's me.

165
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,540
No, I'm not okay.

166
00:15:00,665 --> 00:15:02,542
I don't know
what the hell is going on.

167
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:04,277
Nobody's telling me jack shit.

168
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,445
Flynn.

169
00:15:05,665 --> 00:15:06,530
Whatever.

170
00:15:07,546 --> 00:15:09,080
I don't even care anymore.

171
00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:11,260
Can you just give me
a ride to school?

172
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:13,085
I'll take you to school.

173
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:14,906
Yeah. No.

174
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:16,589
I'm ready now.

175
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,950
Flynn, I'm taking you to school.

176
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:22,712
All right. I'm here.

177
00:15:23,478 --> 00:15:24,628
See you soon.

178
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,119
May I have your attention, please?

179
00:16:48,421 --> 00:16:49,507
As all of you know,

180
00:16:49,797 --> 00:16:52,175
last week our city suffered
a terrible tragedy,

181
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:54,398
one that none of us
will ever forget,

182
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:56,550
which is why today
we're going to take a little time

183
00:16:56,675 --> 00:16:57,891
out of our schedule

184
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,059
to gather in the gym and talk.

185
00:17:01,706 --> 00:17:02,956
I just find it,

186
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:05,541
you know, really...

187
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:07,875
really hard to concentrate

188
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,045
because of all the horrors,

189
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:13,319
you know, we perceived.

190
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:18,101
It just really gets
inside your brain, and...

191
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,178
In college they have
this thing where,

192
00:17:21,303 --> 00:17:23,393
if your roommate kills himself...

193
00:17:23,966 --> 00:17:25,949
like, if you come home
and find him hanging

194
00:17:26,074 --> 00:17:27,677
in the closet or whatever...

195
00:17:27,802 --> 00:17:30,090
it's basically, like,
an automatic "A"

196
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:31,517
for you.

197
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:35,261
And I just think that
that kind of compassion is...

198
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,027
- Okay.
- is something to...

199
00:17:37,152 --> 00:17:38,386
Thank you, Barry.

200
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:39,891
Who wants to go next?

201
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,254
No judgments, guys.

202
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:45,522
Just feelings.

203
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:49,168
You can say anything and everything
that's on your mind.

204
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,777
Anyone?

205
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:56,366
There you go, honey.

206
00:17:58,613 --> 00:18:00,513
I just keep asking myself...

207
00:18:01,055 --> 00:18:03,205
Honey, could you please stand up?

208
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:10,066
Just keep asking myself,
"Why did this happen?"

209
00:18:12,247 --> 00:18:13,883
I mean, if there's a God and all,

210
00:18:14,183 --> 00:18:17,983
why does he allow all those innocent
people to die for no reason?

211
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,306
Can we just keep it secular, honey?

212
00:18:21,503 --> 00:18:24,282
Anyhow, I haven't really
been sleeping much.

213
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:27,397
Does anyone else have that?

214
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:31,526
I just keep hearing that...

215
00:18:31,883 --> 00:18:32,933
that sound.

216
00:18:34,691 --> 00:18:36,546
That... boom.

217
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:40,491
It just plays over
and over in my head

218
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:42,316
like it won't ever stop.

219
00:18:47,036 --> 00:18:48,472
Thank you, sweetheart.

220
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:50,791
Is there anyone else?

221
00:18:51,427 --> 00:18:52,427
Over here.

222
00:18:57,812 --> 00:18:58,912
My neighbor,

223
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:01,449
he heard the crash,

224
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,773
and he ran outside,

225
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:05,717
and he found, like, this seat...

226
00:19:05,972 --> 00:19:08,225
like an airline seat.

227
00:19:08,771 --> 00:19:10,921
Like one you have on an airliner?

228
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:15,473
Anyway, the seat was standing
perfectly upright in his front yard,

229
00:19:15,598 --> 00:19:17,071
right next to his Sea-Doos...

230
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,576
because, like,
he has Sea-Doos... But...

231
00:19:20,442 --> 00:19:22,749
there was still a pair of legs

232
00:19:22,874 --> 00:19:24,274
buckled into them.

233
00:19:25,646 --> 00:19:26,696
Human legs.

234
00:19:28,922 --> 00:19:30,466
Jesus H. Christ.

235
00:19:34,272 --> 00:19:36,122
- You okay?
- Yeah. Sorry.

236
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:39,409
I was just moved.

237
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,264
Maybe we should hear
from the faculty.

238
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,563
Certainly this tragedy

239
00:19:45,688 --> 00:19:47,788
didn't only affect our students.

240
00:19:49,242 --> 00:19:51,815
Mr. White, would you
like to say something?

241
00:19:52,969 --> 00:19:53,983
And by the way,

242
00:19:54,274 --> 00:19:55,424
welcome back.

243
00:20:06,203 --> 00:20:07,831
It's so good to have you back.

244
00:20:24,248 --> 00:20:25,898
I guess what I would...

245
00:20:26,313 --> 00:20:27,642
Sorry. Sorry.

246
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:34,130
I guess what I would
want to say is...

247
00:20:36,088 --> 00:20:38,964
to look on the bright side.

248
00:20:42,762 --> 00:20:44,742
First of all, nobody

249
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,310
on the ground was killed.
And that...

250
00:20:47,671 --> 00:20:49,221
An incident like this

251
00:20:49,346 --> 00:20:51,752
over a populated urban center...

252
00:20:52,404 --> 00:20:55,378
That right there,
that's just gotta be

253
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,728
some minor miracle, so...

254
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,465
Plus...

255
00:20:59,704 --> 00:21:01,354
neither plane was full.

256
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,655
You know, the 737 was...

257
00:21:04,178 --> 00:21:08,099
Was what? Maybe two-thirds full,
I believe. Right? Yes?

258
00:21:08,383 --> 00:21:10,685
Or maybe even three-quarters full.

259
00:21:10,953 --> 00:21:12,053
At any rate,

260
00:21:13,126 --> 00:21:14,538
what you're left with

261
00:21:14,826 --> 00:21:16,126
casualty-wise is

262
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,385
just the 50th worst air disaster.

263
00:21:19,906 --> 00:21:21,891
Actually, tied for 50th.

264
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,231
There are, in truth,

265
00:21:26,505 --> 00:21:27,816
fifty-three

266
00:21:28,957 --> 00:21:32,707
crashes throughout history
that are just as bad

267
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:33,925
or worse...

268
00:21:34,616 --> 00:21:35,616
Tenerife?

269
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,421
Has anybody hear of Tenerife?

270
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:41,916
In 1977,

271
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,551
two fully loaded 747s

272
00:21:45,676 --> 00:21:48,014
crashed into each other on Tenerife.

273
00:21:49,158 --> 00:21:52,606
Does anybody know how big a 747 is?

274
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:56,564
It's way bigger than a 737.
And we're talking about two of them.

275
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,545
Nearly 600 people died

276
00:21:59,991 --> 00:22:01,091
on Tenerife.

277
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:04,021
Doesn't any of you
even remember it at all?

278
00:22:04,942 --> 00:22:06,592
Any of you? I doubt it.

279
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:08,076
You know why?

280
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,494
It's because...

281
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,724
people move on.

282
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:15,812
They just move on.

283
00:22:15,937 --> 00:22:19,253
And we will, too. We will move on,
and we will get past this

284
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,089
because that is
what human beings do.

285
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,184
We survive.

286
00:22:24,355 --> 00:22:25,355
And...

287
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:29,891
We survive, and we...
We overcome.

288
00:22:32,857 --> 00:22:35,276
We survive.
We survive, and...

289
00:22:38,727 --> 00:22:39,727
Thank you.

290
00:22:41,072 --> 00:22:42,072
Good.

291
00:25:20,135 --> 00:25:22,035
How's your Aunt Marie doing?

292
00:25:24,118 --> 00:25:25,118
Fine,

293
00:25:25,321 --> 00:25:26,414
I guess.

294
00:25:28,032 --> 00:25:30,403
You make sure you say hello
to her for me, will you?

295
00:25:30,772 --> 00:25:32,630
Why don't you just come inside?

296
00:25:32,755 --> 00:25:34,055
It's your house.

297
00:25:35,754 --> 00:25:36,754
No, I...

298
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:13,938
He's gone.

299
00:26:18,254 --> 00:26:19,576
Hey, Flynn!

300
00:26:20,004 --> 00:26:21,452
- How's tricks?
- What?

301
00:26:21,577 --> 00:26:23,222
Tricks.
It's an expression.

302
00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:25,209
How are you?

303
00:26:26,322 --> 00:26:28,722
Why do you gotta
treat him like this?

304
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:32,256
Why you gotta be like this?
Why can't you just talk, even?

305
00:26:32,837 --> 00:26:33,837
Cool down.

306
00:26:47,628 --> 00:26:49,232
Out of the mouths of babes.

307
00:26:55,026 --> 00:26:56,863
Try not to hold it against him.

308
00:26:56,988 --> 00:26:59,574
I mean,
the poor kid, he's probably just

309
00:27:00,563 --> 00:27:02,719
dying of curiosity.

310
00:27:03,817 --> 00:27:05,766
And I guess it would be natural

311
00:27:05,891 --> 00:27:08,338
for him to wonder.

312
00:27:08,463 --> 00:27:09,794
He's probably just wondering

313
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:12,285
what is it that could
have gone so wrong...

314
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,799
- Marie.
- ... that my mother would leave...

315
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,915
I can't help you get
through this, Skyler,

316
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,552
you know, if you won't tell me

317
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:20,622
what it is that Walt did.

318
00:27:20,747 --> 00:27:22,764
You know what?
I don't remember

319
00:27:22,889 --> 00:27:24,109
asking you, all right?

320
00:27:24,234 --> 00:27:25,851
So if you want to be supportive,

321
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:29,810
you could be supportive without prying,
that would be really great...

322
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:31,356
and so...

323
00:27:32,523 --> 00:27:33,523
helpful.

324
00:27:40,481 --> 00:27:41,581
It's that...

325
00:27:42,524 --> 00:27:44,174
voice inside your head.

326
00:27:46,336 --> 00:27:49,618
It's that sneaky,
rat-bastard, 24/7 voice.

327
00:27:52,051 --> 00:27:55,858
You guys know what I'm talking about.
It tells you you're not good enough.

328
00:27:56,694 --> 00:27:59,594
Not good enough for what?
Not good enough to...

329
00:28:00,437 --> 00:28:02,987
be what,
President of the United States?

330
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,309
Okay, so maybe you're not that good.

331
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,047
But now,

332
00:28:08,716 --> 00:28:11,139
are you good enough
to deserve your share

333
00:28:11,264 --> 00:28:13,149
of basic human happiness?

334
00:28:14,195 --> 00:28:18,080
Are you good enough to be okay
with who and what you are?

335
00:28:18,845 --> 00:28:19,845
I say yes.

336
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:26,786
But it doesn't matter what I say.

337
00:28:27,945 --> 00:28:30,448
It's your voice, which means
you're the only one that hears it,

338
00:28:30,573 --> 00:28:33,236
which means that you're
the only one that can fight it.

339
00:28:33,361 --> 00:28:34,361
Right?

340
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,125
Jesse...

341
00:28:37,185 --> 00:28:38,591
we never hear from you.

342
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,185
What's going on?

343
00:28:41,689 --> 00:28:44,659
You can tell me I'm full of shit.
It's okay. I don't mind.

344
00:28:44,964 --> 00:28:46,264
Just... Come on.

345
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:48,225
Let us in on it.

346
00:28:55,227 --> 00:28:56,227
So, like,

347
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:59,216
what makes you the expert?

348
00:29:00,626 --> 00:29:02,354
I don't think
I ever said I was that.

349
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:05,076
Yeah, but you're the one
sitting here, right?

350
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,143
Telling us thus and so,

351
00:29:08,002 --> 00:29:09,852
be happy, forgive yourself,

352
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,540
Have you ever really hurt anybody?

353
00:29:16,827 --> 00:29:19,875
I don't just mean disappointed
your mother or whatever,

354
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,376
but did you...

355
00:29:23,382 --> 00:29:24,582
ever really...

356
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:26,829
hurt someone?

357
00:29:30,071 --> 00:29:31,621
I killed my daughter.

358
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:40,272
It was July 18th...

359
00:29:41,191 --> 00:29:42,741
which is my birthday.

360
00:29:43,431 --> 00:29:44,654
July 18th,

361
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:46,830
1992.

362
00:29:47,927 --> 00:29:49,192
I was...

363
00:29:49,317 --> 00:29:51,414
high on cocaine, and I was drunk.

364
00:29:51,947 --> 00:29:54,388
Cocaine wasn't an issue
because I had bought myself 2 grams

365
00:29:54,513 --> 00:29:56,794
the night before as a birthday present.
I had plenty left.

366
00:29:57,955 --> 00:29:59,605
But I was out of vodka.

367
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:02,753
And this is in Portsmouth, Virginia,

368
00:30:02,878 --> 00:30:05,818
where instead of selling
liquor in the supermarkets,

369
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:07,847
they have these ABC stores

370
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:09,484
which close at 5 p.m.

371
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:13,055
And right then it was, like, 4:42.

372
00:30:15,969 --> 00:30:18,065
So I'm arguing with my wife...

373
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,283
"Come on, go to the ABC for me.

374
00:30:20,538 --> 00:30:22,111
"It's my birthday.

375
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,279
"Come on.

376
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,523
"They're not gonna sell it to me."

377
00:30:27,881 --> 00:30:29,531
She's saying, "No, no."

378
00:30:31,557 --> 00:30:32,757
So I'm pissed,

379
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:36,120
and the clock is ticking,
so I jump in my truck.

380
00:30:37,396 --> 00:30:38,396
She's...

381
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:40,554
my 6-year-old daughter...

382
00:30:42,412 --> 00:30:44,522
She's playing at the end
of the driveway.

383
00:30:55,284 --> 00:30:57,072
How do you not hate yourself?

384
00:30:58,808 --> 00:31:00,308
I did hate myself...

385
00:31:00,715 --> 00:31:02,026
for a long time.

386
00:31:03,285 --> 00:31:04,958
But it didn't stop me from...

387
00:31:05,723 --> 00:31:07,391
drinking and getting high.

388
00:31:07,516 --> 00:31:09,616
It just made it that much worse.

389
00:31:12,307 --> 00:31:13,940
Self-hatred, guilt,

390
00:31:14,723 --> 00:31:16,423
it accomplishes nothing.

391
00:31:17,063 --> 00:31:18,834
It just stands in the way.

392
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,240
Stands in the way of what?

393
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:24,682
True change.

394
00:31:58,367 --> 00:32:00,000
Is this a good time to talk?

395
00:32:01,334 --> 00:32:02,934
Yeah. Come in, please.

396
00:32:31,753 --> 00:32:33,303
Do you want to start?

397
00:33:05,429 --> 00:33:06,899
Why are you doing this?

398
00:33:07,024 --> 00:33:09,361
Why are you even thinking this way?

399
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:11,134
Is it to punish me?

400
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:14,783
- I am not punishing you, Walt.
- This is punitive

401
00:33:15,585 --> 00:33:16,885
is what this is.

402
00:33:17,825 --> 00:33:19,121
We are happily married.

403
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:21,332
I am happily married.

404
00:33:21,704 --> 00:33:22,754
I am happy.

405
00:33:23,729 --> 00:33:24,879
We're just...

406
00:33:31,406 --> 00:33:32,456
I love you,

407
00:33:34,274 --> 00:33:37,065
and I would do anything for you.

408
00:33:39,544 --> 00:33:41,971
Would you even consider...

409
00:33:42,346 --> 00:33:44,176
I mean, Jesus!

410
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:48,550
You come in here,
and you wave these papers in my face,

411
00:33:48,912 --> 00:33:50,883
when there's a whole other

412
00:33:51,226 --> 00:33:53,761
entire side to this thing.

413
00:33:54,118 --> 00:33:56,200
There's your side,
and there's my side.

414
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,213
And you haven't heard my side yet.

415
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:01,255
- You haven't heard any of it at all.
- You're a drug dealer.

416
00:34:23,598 --> 00:34:26,111
How else could you possibly
make that kind of money?

417
00:34:31,049 --> 00:34:32,049
Marijuana.

418
00:34:33,943 --> 00:34:35,293
That Pinkman kid.

419
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,980
Cocaine?

420
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:00,116
It's methamphetamine.

421
00:35:03,115 --> 00:35:04,115
But I'm...

422
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,303
I manufacture.
I am not a dealer.

423
00:35:09,832 --> 00:35:10,963
<i>Per se.</i>

424
00:35:12,346 --> 00:35:13,746
It doesn't mean...

425
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,537
No, Skyler.

426
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,197
Listen to me.

427
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,618
There are a lot of angles to this, okay?
It's complicated.

428
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,912
All right?
So please, let's... Please,

429
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,249
let's just sit back down,
and we'll talk it through.

430
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,589
I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.

431
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,900
I won't tell Hank,

432
00:35:32,342 --> 00:35:34,342
and I won't tell your children

433
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:37,052
or anybody else.
Nobody will hear it from me,

434
00:35:37,624 --> 00:35:40,345
but only
if you grant me this divorce

435
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,913
and stay out of our lives.
I mean it.

436
00:35:44,691 --> 00:35:46,560
Now let me out of here
before I throw up.

437
00:36:22,769 --> 00:36:24,519
Your windshield's broken.

438
00:36:27,834 --> 00:36:28,626
Yep.

439
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:37,003
A little friction

440
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,120
in the marriage right now.

441
00:36:39,341 --> 00:36:40,647
Strictly temporary.

442
00:36:40,772 --> 00:36:41,922
We're just...

443
00:36:42,403 --> 00:36:44,253
just taking a little break.

444
00:36:46,812 --> 00:36:48,412
That's you over there.

445
00:36:51,352 --> 00:36:52,202
Listen,

446
00:36:52,702 --> 00:36:53,502
money.

447
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,349
Saul has got it for you,

448
00:36:56,474 --> 00:36:59,724
- so as soon as you're feeling better...
- I'm better.

449
00:37:00,702 --> 00:37:01,902
You're better.

450
00:37:02,657 --> 00:37:03,507
Really?

451
00:37:04,654 --> 00:37:06,154
What? The rehab?

452
00:37:06,397 --> 00:37:07,342
It helped?

453
00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:08,259
Yeah.

454
00:37:09,036 --> 00:37:10,286
I'm done using.

455
00:37:12,968 --> 00:37:14,818
That's excellent. That's...

456
00:37:16,157 --> 00:37:18,257
That's very good, Jesse.
Boy...

457
00:37:19,208 --> 00:37:20,208
Very good.

458
00:37:22,343 --> 00:37:23,593
You know, um...

459
00:37:26,356 --> 00:37:28,306
in spite of how bad things got,

460
00:37:29,022 --> 00:37:31,209
it really could be looked at

461
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:33,634
like a wake-up call for both of us.

462
00:37:34,727 --> 00:37:36,468
You know, just to get our...

463
00:37:36,593 --> 00:37:38,543
our lives back together again

464
00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:42,199
and on the straight and narrow.

465
00:37:45,593 --> 00:37:47,890
You been following
this airplane crash?

466
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:50,493
Yeah.

467
00:37:52,088 --> 00:37:53,338
You know it was

468
00:37:53,463 --> 00:37:56,106
Jane's dad who accidentally
crashed them together?

469
00:37:56,904 --> 00:37:58,317
Because he was so torn up?

470
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:01,362
Let me stop you
right there, all right?

471
00:38:02,457 --> 00:38:04,708
You are not responsible for this...

472
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:07,621
not in any way, shape,
or form, all right?

473
00:38:07,982 --> 00:38:10,263
Now, I am very up-to-date
on this thing,

474
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,488
probably far more than you are,

475
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:14,277
and there are... there are...

476
00:38:14,402 --> 00:38:16,252
many factors at play there.

477
00:38:16,647 --> 00:38:17,439
Yeah?

478
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,610
For instance,

479
00:38:20,104 --> 00:38:22,454
there's some sort of collision radar

480
00:38:23,022 --> 00:38:25,552
on the jet that may not
have been working properly.

481
00:38:25,677 --> 00:38:27,679
That's public record.
You can look that up.

482
00:38:28,178 --> 00:38:29,981
And the whole system is run on...

483
00:38:30,106 --> 00:38:31,606
on 1960s technology.

484
00:38:31,932 --> 00:38:32,724
No.

485
00:38:33,824 --> 00:38:34,974
No, really...

486
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,546
I blame the government.

487
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,960
You either run from things,

488
00:38:42,085 --> 00:38:43,985
or you face them, Mr. White.

489
00:38:45,336 --> 00:38:47,486
And what exactly does that mean?

490
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:48,951
I learned it in rehab.

491
00:38:50,785 --> 00:38:53,535
It's all about accepting
who you really are.

492
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:56,484
I accept who I am.

493
00:38:57,189 --> 00:38:58,293
And who are you?

494
00:39:00,303 --> 00:39:01,603
I'm the bad guy.

495
00:39:28,274 --> 00:39:30,069
Is the food to your satisfaction?

496
00:39:30,573 --> 00:39:31,573
Very much.

497
00:39:32,368 --> 00:39:34,218
It's good to see you again.

498
00:39:37,898 --> 00:39:38,698
May I?

499
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:48,802
I have an offer that I think
will be of interest to you.

500
00:39:51,149 --> 00:39:52,559
I actually...

501
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:54,725
am not here to...

502
00:39:58,247 --> 00:39:59,147
I'm here

503
00:40:00,249 --> 00:40:02,046
because I owe you

504
00:40:02,171 --> 00:40:03,942
the courtesy and respect

505
00:40:04,231 --> 00:40:06,131
to tell you this personally.

506
00:40:09,303 --> 00:40:10,253
I'm done.

507
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,785
It has nothing to do

508
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,453
with you personally.

509
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:19,211
I find you extraordinarily
professional,

510
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:21,460
and I appreciate
the way you do business.

511
00:40:22,173 --> 00:40:23,223
I'm just...

512
00:40:24,651 --> 00:40:26,462
making a change in my life

513
00:40:26,587 --> 00:40:28,337
is what it is, and I'm...

514
00:40:29,711 --> 00:40:32,311
I'm at some...
something of a crossroads.

515
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,033
It has...

516
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,000
brought me to a realization.

517
00:40:41,364 --> 00:40:42,864
I am not a criminal.

518
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,477
No offense to any people who are.

519
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,660
But...

520
00:40:53,683 --> 00:40:54,933
this is not me.

521
00:40:58,111 --> 00:41:00,832
I'd like you to hear my offer,
notwithstanding.

522
00:41:02,789 --> 00:41:05,003
It won't change my mind.
I'm sorry.

523
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,358
$3 million

524
00:41:07,351 --> 00:41:09,351
for three months of your time.

525
00:41:12,587 --> 00:41:13,737
Three months,

526
00:41:14,063 --> 00:41:15,013
then out.

527
00:41:21,463 --> 00:41:22,463
3 million?

528
00:41:25,743 --> 00:41:28,116
May I take this as a yes?

529
00:41:37,651 --> 00:41:38,801
I have money.

530
00:41:39,105 --> 00:41:41,805
I have more money
than I know how to spend.

531
00:41:43,474 --> 00:41:45,626
What I don't have is my family.

532
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,430
The answer is still no.

533
00:41:57,466 --> 00:41:58,766
Enjoy your meal.

534
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,356
Thank you.

535
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,233
What the hell is going on?
