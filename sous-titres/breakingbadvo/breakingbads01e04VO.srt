1
00:00:02,412 --> 00:00:03,685
Operation...

2
00:00:04,244 --> 00:00:05,537
Icebreaker.

3
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,949
How we liking that?
We never used that before, did we?

4
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:13,033
- Isn't it the name of a breath mint?
- What?

5
00:00:13,061 --> 00:00:14,845
"Icebreakers", right? Breath mint?

6
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,443
Nobody's gonna be
thinking that.

7
00:00:16,459 --> 00:00:19,265
They'll think about a big ass ship
in the North Pole, breaking ice.

8
00:00:19,392 --> 00:00:22,618
Says you. I'm gonna be thinking
"Operation Breath Mint."

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,415
I'm thinking "Operation Breath Mint"
every time we're on a stakeout together.

10
00:00:26,636 --> 00:00:29,353
Your breath could knock
a buzzard off a shit wagon.

11
00:00:29,474 --> 00:00:30,730
All right.

12
00:00:30,768 --> 00:00:33,739
"Operation TBD."

13
00:00:34,128 --> 00:00:35,763
Thanks for nothing, Gomie.

14
00:00:35,826 --> 00:00:37,619
Anyway.
Say hello to...

15
00:00:37,697 --> 00:00:41,203
Domingo Gallardo Molina,
AKA "Krazy 8."

16
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:45,603
Smarter than your average cheese-eater.
I turned him out at the street-level,

17
00:00:45,614 --> 00:00:48,577
but this dude's like
the Jeffersons: movin' on up.

18
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:51,901
Every small-time dealers he'd throw at
us, he'd end up snaking their customers.

19
00:00:51,902 --> 00:00:54,499
It turns out he's missing,
presumed dead.

20
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:56,842
Found his car
out in the boonies.

21
00:00:56,961 --> 00:01:00,932
Last guy he ratted out
was none other than his cousin,

22
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,243
Emilio Koyama.

23
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,646
You thinking the cousin
found out and took revenge?

24
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:08,252
Could be.
Turns out he's missing, too.

25
00:01:08,477 --> 00:01:11,594
Normally, I'd say someone
did the world a favor.

26
00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:14,015
But our snitch's car?

27
00:01:14,206 --> 00:01:17,680
Turns out we find two grams of meth
in it, we take it to the lab.

28
00:01:17,772 --> 00:01:21,180
They come back, they tell us it is
the purest they have ever seen.

29
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:22,759
99.1%.

30
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:26,138
Our chemist was blown away. He said
he couldn't do the same thing better.

31
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:29,158
Worse yet, it didn't come out of
some superlab in Mexico.

32
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:32,217
We're thinking this was cooked
right here, in the Land of Enchantment.

33
00:01:32,423 --> 00:01:35,968
Car was abandoned at
what appears to be a cook site.

34
00:01:36,251 --> 00:01:38,926
This is the only other
thing left behind.

35
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:42,336
We're sending it off to Quantico,
see if they can pull something off it.

36
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,622
Meantime, our guys swabbed the filter
element and found the same 99.1 meth.

37
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:50,430
So be on notice.

38
00:01:51,335 --> 00:01:53,351
We got new players in town.

39
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:57,732
We don't know who they are,
where they come from...

40
00:01:58,206 --> 00:02:01,002
but they possess an
extremely high skill-set.

41
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,660
Me personally?

42
00:02:03,848 --> 00:02:07,317
I'm thinking Albuquerque just
might have a new kingpin.

45
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,081
Jesus. Walt, you're burning
the shit out of them.

46
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:46,707
Damn it.

47
00:02:47,117 --> 00:02:49,625
Hey, Sky, you got
any more chicken?

48
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:52,463
Emeril here is gonna
need a fresh pack.

49
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,271
All right,
looking good.

50
00:02:55,363 --> 00:02:58,111
Is this low-fat mayonnaise
in the cole slaw?

51
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:01,223
I don't know.
It's store-bought.

52
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:04,551
Hank, you need
another beer?

53
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,471
Does the Pope shit in his hat?

54
00:03:06,504 --> 00:03:08,366
I don't think
that he does, Hank.

55
00:03:08,415 --> 00:03:11,563
And I think everybody would like it
if you'd stop saying that.

56
00:03:11,616 --> 00:03:14,518
- Marie, some more wine, maybe?
- I'm all right, thanks.

57
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:16,065
Hey, I want a beer.

58
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:19,248
Yeah. I want Shania Twain
to give me a tuggie.

59
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,567
Guess what?
That ain't happening, either.

60
00:03:21,647 --> 00:03:23,890
- How about some more soda?
- Yeah, sure.

61
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:25,892
Honey, do you need anything?

62
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:29,074
- No, Walt. Thank you.
- Okay. I'll be right back.

63
00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:52,098
What, are you kidding me?

64
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:54,559
You look like
a damn movie star, man.

65
00:03:54,685 --> 00:03:57,353
Girls gotta be lining up
left and right.

66
00:03:57,807 --> 00:04:00,315
- Tell him how good-looking he is.
- He's adorable.

67
00:04:00,355 --> 00:04:02,957
He don't wanna be friggin' adorable.
He wants to be hot.

68
00:04:03,096 --> 00:04:05,873
You see what I'm talking about?
That's a female perspective.

69
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,436
She supposed to say that.

70
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:10,267
Look, a guy doesn't have
to look like, uh...

71
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,409
Charlton Heston...
I'm talking "Moses" days...

72
00:04:13,727 --> 00:04:15,503
to get a girl,
all right?

73
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,300
You just gotta have...

74
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,374
confidence.

75
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:22,660
Confidence and...
and persistence.

76
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:25,037
That's what I'm talking about.

77
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:27,857
I chased your Aunt Marie here
all over creation.

78
00:04:28,057 --> 00:04:31,012
I kept bugging her for a date.
She kept saying no.

79
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:32,787
What, did I ask you
like 50 times?

80
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,924
It was before
they tightened the stalking laws.

81
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:39,477
Anyway, how about your dad here?

82
00:04:39,854 --> 00:04:41,721
Right there's a good story, Walt.

83
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:43,269
Tell him how you met Skyler.

84
00:04:43,287 --> 00:04:46,336
Mom was a waitress
in Los Alamos.

85
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:50,569
And Dad said
that thing to you...

86
00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:53,355
Actually, your mother
wasn't a waitress.

87
00:04:53,948 --> 00:04:55,658
It was a summer job,

88
00:04:55,677 --> 00:04:58,304
and she was the hostess,

89
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:00,819
and she also worked
the cash register.

90
00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:03,103
And I used to go
in there a lot

91
00:05:03,107 --> 00:05:06,986
because it was close enough to the lab
where I could ride my bicycle.

92
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,671
And once I noticed her...

93
00:05:10,885 --> 00:05:14,005
it got to be so that
I would only go in

94
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,007
when I knew she was working.

95
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:19,490
When it was slow,
she would lean against the counter,

96
00:05:19,877 --> 00:05:21,963
doing her crossword puzzles,

97
00:05:22,177 --> 00:05:24,302
but kind of hiding it, right,

98
00:05:24,321 --> 00:05:26,735
pretending that
she was still working.

99
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:28,941
And once I caught on to that,

100
00:05:28,989 --> 00:05:32,819
I would do crossword puzzles
while I ate my grilled cheese sandwich.

101
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:35,260
It got so that
everyday at lunch,

102
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:39,211
we would both be doing
the New York Times crossword puzzle

103
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:41,299
ten feet from each other.

104
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:46,429
Eventually,

105
00:05:46,842 --> 00:05:49,472
I caught her
looking over at me.

106
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,081
So, I began saying,
"Excuse me.

107
00:05:55,265 --> 00:05:59,104
"Fourteen across, seven-letter word
for whatchamacallit.

108
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:01,797
"May I ask what
you wrote down?"

109
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,560
That got us talking.

110
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:10,641
Boy, I tell you, I was...
I was terrible at those puzzles.

111
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,054
I don't think that I finished
even one of them.

112
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:18,100
But your mother
would do them in ink.

113
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,306
Very smooth.

114
00:06:21,593 --> 00:06:24,177
I'll bet you didn't think
your old man had it in him?

115
00:06:24,179 --> 00:06:26,523
But that's what I'm talking about.
That's persistence.

116
00:06:26,634 --> 00:06:29,663
You see? Once you set
your cap for something,

117
00:06:29,784 --> 00:06:32,596
or somebody,
you gotta just, you know...

118
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:36,612
Skyler?

119
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:39,127
Mom, are you all right?

120
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,208
Shh, honey. It's okay.

121
00:06:44,007 --> 00:06:45,468
What's the matter?

122
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,340
What is it?

123
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:53,166
Ask him.

124
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:05,559
What's she talking about?

125
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,501
Walt.

126
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,636
I have cancer.

127
00:07:25,786 --> 00:07:27,192
Lung cancer.

128
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:38,507
It's bad.

129
00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:02,701
Ask him how long he's known.

130
00:08:04,141 --> 00:08:06,258
I guess a month,
maybe, or...

131
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:08,116
For God sakes, Walt.

132
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:11,192
We're just sitting out there having
a cookout like nothing's going on?

133
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,929
He made me promise
not to tell anybody.

134
00:08:14,403 --> 00:08:16,840
Christ, these last 48 hours.

135
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:19,775
And it's the weekend,

136
00:08:20,037 --> 00:08:22,586
so I couldn't even get
his doctor on the phone.

137
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:26,385
Buddy, why... I mean,
why wouldn't you want to tell anybody?

138
00:08:27,262 --> 00:08:28,695
Don't you see?

139
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:31,397
Everybody just wants
to help you.

140
00:08:31,853 --> 00:08:33,379
We're family.

141
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,095
We get through
these things together.

142
00:08:36,188 --> 00:08:38,140
I mean, I don't get...
You know...

143
00:08:38,316 --> 00:08:39,855
Lung cancer?

144
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,289
How could that happen?
You don't smoke.

145
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:44,599
I'm thinking that
this goes back

146
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,098
20 years maybe
to the applications lab.

147
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:49,508
All those chemicals
they had you working around?

148
00:08:49,582 --> 00:08:51,732
We always took
the proper precautions.

149
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:55,594
One time you complained they didn't
give you the right kind of...

150
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:58,919
I don't know, some kind
of ventilation hood or something.

151
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:01,778
- And then the headaches.
- Honey, it wasn't that.

152
00:09:01,848 --> 00:09:04,637
How do they think they
can get away with this?

153
00:09:04,757 --> 00:09:06,677
We should hire a lawyer.

154
00:09:07,258 --> 00:09:09,597
First, let's deal with this.

155
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:14,045
Okay? So what's
the next step for Walt?

156
00:09:14,941 --> 00:09:17,484
Certainly a second
opinion, right?

157
00:09:17,901 --> 00:09:18,870
Right.

158
00:09:19,346 --> 00:09:20,590
Right. Absolutely.

159
00:09:20,618 --> 00:09:22,807
Okay. So first thing
tomorrow,

160
00:09:23,182 --> 00:09:25,245
I talk to my radiologists,

161
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:28,202
we find you the best...

162
00:09:28,282 --> 00:09:31,392
the oncology dream team.

163
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:51,112
I wanna go check
on Walt Jr.

164
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:53,929
I'm gonna see...

165
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:57,803
if I can talk him into,
I don't know, joining us.

166
00:09:58,385 --> 00:10:01,776
I really didn't mean for him
to find out that way.

167
00:10:11,868 --> 00:10:13,486
Whatever happens...

168
00:10:15,294 --> 00:10:17,778
I hope this goes
without saying, but...

169
00:10:17,916 --> 00:10:19,557
whatever happens...

170
00:10:20,841 --> 00:10:23,091
I want you to know that...

171
00:10:24,387 --> 00:10:27,060
I'll always take care
of your family.

172
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:57,207
Yo, check out
these fake Pop Tarts.

173
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,874
These are mad tight.

174
00:10:58,928 --> 00:11:01,603
- No, thanks, man. Pass.
- Your loss.

175
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,484
These are from Canada
or something. Imported.

176
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,828
Yo, what happened
to your hallway, man?

177
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:09,690
- Did the ceiling fall down or...
- Oh, yeah...

178
00:11:10,824 --> 00:11:13,589
I think the house
is just settling.

179
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:16,486
It's been caving in
left and right.

180
00:11:16,535 --> 00:11:18,248
Hit me in the eye.

181
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,818
It's bananas.

182
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:23,596
Yo, my pops could fix you up.
He's like a contractor or something.

183
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,674
Right on.
I should grab that number.

184
00:11:26,683 --> 00:11:29,754
Say, Jesse.
You still cook a little crystal?

185
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,927
Could be, yeah.

186
00:11:35,031 --> 00:11:37,121
You know,
from time to time.

187
00:11:37,352 --> 00:11:39,579
I heard you lost
your partner.

188
00:11:40,372 --> 00:11:41,420
Emilio.

189
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:46,060
- Didn't he get locked up?
- No, man. He's out.

190
00:11:46,124 --> 00:11:49,400
His cousin bailed him out.
He skipped town or something.

191
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:51,581
I don't know about
any of that.

192
00:11:51,765 --> 00:11:54,210
I've been kinda doing
my own thing these days.

193
00:11:54,398 --> 00:11:56,964
But you maybe got
some crystal, man?

194
00:11:57,296 --> 00:12:01,081
'Cause I could seriously go for a bowl.
You know? Take the edge off.

195
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,111
Hell, yeah.
Sunday night bowl, yo.

196
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,011
Maybe it just
so happens that...

197
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,528
I just recently cooked
the best batch ever.

198
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,569
Oh, yeah. Came up with
this whole new recipe.

199
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,603
It's more like a formula.

200
00:12:23,641 --> 00:12:27,408
It's like way,
way more chemically...

201
00:12:28,627 --> 00:12:30,760
You know, it's just the bomb.

202
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,081
But, you know, I don't know,

203
00:12:34,082 --> 00:12:37,454
I've been thinking lately
I'll just lay off of it for a while.

204
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:40,702
'Cause lately it's been
making me paranoid, so...

205
00:12:45,691 --> 00:12:48,768
You know, for, like...
like healthwise, just lay off.

206
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,046
Yo, if you're not
into sharing, man,

207
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:53,183
just tell us to piss off.
It's cool.

208
00:12:53,227 --> 00:12:54,880
We don't need no soap opera.

209
00:12:54,937 --> 00:12:56,283
Yeah, man.
Whatever.

210
00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:58,065
No, no.
It's all good.

211
00:12:58,071 --> 00:13:00,097
You know, I...
I'm just saying...

212
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,664
Hey, I got...
I got plenty of pot.

213
00:13:02,837 --> 00:13:04,976
Yeah, I think
I'll bounce, man.

214
00:13:05,115 --> 00:13:06,884
Yeah, sounds about right.

215
00:13:07,532 --> 00:13:08,688
Hey, yo, yo.

216
00:13:08,828 --> 00:13:10,045
Hey, homes.

217
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,489
I'm joking.

218
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:14,283
Okay, I'm totally
joking with you.

219
00:13:15,203 --> 00:13:17,075
You kidding?
Sit down.

220
00:13:24,483 --> 00:13:26,316
Best scante ever.

221
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,128
Grab that pipe.

222
00:16:42,755 --> 00:16:44,537
Do you need
some help?

223
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,674
No, I'm fine, honey.

224
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:50,712
I'm fine. Just...

225
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:52,464
Privacy.

226
00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:53,803
Thanks.

227
00:16:56,563 --> 00:16:58,762
I'm right outside
if you need me.

228
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:10,445
Yeah, anytime on Friday
is absolutely fine.

229
00:17:10,491 --> 00:17:12,971
Thank you so much
for working us in.

230
00:17:15,594 --> 00:17:17,949
Can I just put that
on a credit card?

231
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:19,464
Great.

232
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,555
Perfect.

233
00:17:20,761 --> 00:17:23,085
Okay, so we will see you

234
00:17:23,201 --> 00:17:25,536
at 10:45 on Friday morning.

235
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:28,116
Thank you so much.

236
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,537
Honey.

237
00:17:35,878 --> 00:17:37,901
The best oncologist...

238
00:17:37,994 --> 00:17:39,875
I mean, not even
just in New Mexico,

239
00:17:39,877 --> 00:17:42,925
but one of the top ten
in the entire nation...

240
00:17:43,148 --> 00:17:46,109
His name is Dr. Delcavoli.

241
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,418
And we see him on Friday.

242
00:17:51,468 --> 00:17:53,942
I mean, Marie really
came through for us.

243
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:56,092
She had her boss call and...

244
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:02,172
This is good.

245
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:05,142
From here on out,
things are gonna...

246
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,602
What's that
we're putting on a credit card?

247
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,420
It's just a deposit
kind of thing.

248
00:18:11,385 --> 00:18:14,453
- How much of a deposit?
- It's $5,000.

249
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,066
Five thousand?

250
00:18:24,453 --> 00:18:26,405
And what's that?
Just to start?

251
00:18:26,637 --> 00:18:28,699
Just to tell me
what I already know?

252
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:31,705
Walt, he's not
in our HMO, okay?

253
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:34,079
So be it.
We'll figure it out.

254
00:18:36,056 --> 00:18:39,148
Come on. Don't get hung up
on money here.

255
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,559
We can always borrow
from Hank.

256
00:18:41,626 --> 00:18:43,132
Absolutely not.

257
00:18:46,096 --> 00:18:47,251
No, I just...

258
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,306
We're not gonna do that.

259
00:18:50,022 --> 00:18:52,327
Well, maybe we
can ask your mom.

260
00:18:54,651 --> 00:18:56,784
Have you even
called her yet?

261
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:02,431
Regardless,
you're gonna have to tell her.

262
00:19:02,437 --> 00:19:04,827
- I'm willing to do it...
- I'll call.

263
00:19:08,953 --> 00:19:11,770
I don't want us
thinking about money.

264
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:16,114
Money is not the issue here.
It's not.

265
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:27,686
I'll take care of the deposit.

266
00:19:33,843 --> 00:19:36,117
I'll borrow it
from my pension.

267
00:20:13,326 --> 00:20:14,520
What's up?

268
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:20,473
I thought I heard mice.

269
00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:23,518
That's all we need, huh?

270
00:20:25,465 --> 00:20:27,045
So, what's up, pal?

271
00:20:27,176 --> 00:20:29,435
What the hell's
wrong with you?

272
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:33,759
What?

273
00:20:35,094 --> 00:20:36,899
You're acting all...

274
00:20:40,704 --> 00:20:42,790
Why are you acting so...

275
00:20:43,163 --> 00:20:44,499
weird?

276
00:20:46,098 --> 00:20:48,835
You're acting like
nothing is going on.

277
00:22:41,448 --> 00:22:42,597
Come on!

278
00:22:43,511 --> 00:22:46,628
Am I gonna have to come down
there and whip your ass?

279
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:03,211
And let me tell you something else.
I'm not doing this for charity, right?

280
00:23:03,365 --> 00:23:05,931
I'm the best he's got in that office.
He knows it, I know it.

281
00:23:05,936 --> 00:23:08,634
I expect to be paid
to a level comens...

282
00:23:09,535 --> 00:23:12,887
I said, "Dave, do you think
40 grand is a proper bonus?"

283
00:23:13,128 --> 00:23:16,088
That's less than 10% of what
I booked for you guys this quarter.

284
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,478
I'm not going to sit here
and be disrespected.

285
00:23:18,555 --> 00:23:20,588
Oh, he's shitin bricks.

286
00:23:20,821 --> 00:23:22,220
Oh, you know he is.

287
00:23:22,323 --> 00:23:24,751
Yeah, that man lives in fear.
I'll go across town.

288
00:23:24,763 --> 00:23:26,394
Hell, I could go anywhere.

289
00:23:26,497 --> 00:23:29,942
Hoffman-Gordon-Bradley or Sorcher,
even Goldberg-Wayne.

290
00:23:29,988 --> 00:23:32,665
They'd make me a partner
just for walking in the damn door.

291
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:34,664
That's how ecstatic
they'd be.

292
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:36,985
Hells, yes, brother-man!

293
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,084
Check this chick out.

294
00:23:41,698 --> 00:23:42,589
Who?

295
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:45,627
Buddy, she's a cow.

296
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:47,799
Stacey's a cow.

297
00:23:48,503 --> 00:23:50,894
We're talking major
barnyard boo-hog.

298
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:55,159
Roll her in flour and look for the wet
spot before you hit that, man. You know?

299
00:23:58,573 --> 00:23:59,434
Sir?

300
00:24:01,163 --> 00:24:02,171
Sir?

301
00:24:04,991 --> 00:24:06,514
Sorry. Hi.

302
00:24:07,537 --> 00:24:09,446
- What can I do for you?
- Which dude?

303
00:24:09,506 --> 00:24:11,591
The dude that looked
like a lizard?

304
00:24:13,813 --> 00:24:14,938
I'm sorry.

305
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:19,300
I would like a cashier's check
in the full amount

306
00:24:19,594 --> 00:24:23,555
made out to Oncology Partners
of New Mexico, please.

307
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,728
Oh, that's O-N-C-O-L-O-G-Y.

308
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:31,167
Yeah, you got it.

309
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:35,533
I don't understand
why they're forcing you

310
00:24:35,536 --> 00:24:37,776
to choose between
the piccolo and the oboe.

311
00:24:37,815 --> 00:24:40,049
You show so much
promise with both.

312
00:24:40,108 --> 00:24:42,288
They can't have
any switching between woodwinds

313
00:24:42,303 --> 00:24:44,871
because no matter how divided up,
someone would be left out.

314
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:46,687
Well, rules are rules, I guess.

315
00:24:46,731 --> 00:24:48,819
Sure, rules and rules.
I'm all for that.

316
00:24:48,843 --> 00:24:52,201
But I'm telling you,
you really shine on that oboe.

317
00:24:52,293 --> 00:24:54,790
You have real talent,
and I'm not just saying that.

318
00:24:54,906 --> 00:24:55,937
Thanks.

319
00:24:57,068 --> 00:25:00,737
What about Mr. Pemberton? Is he
giving you enough individual attention?

320
00:25:00,739 --> 00:25:02,023
I'd have to say so.

321
00:25:02,057 --> 00:25:05,379
He tries to talk to each one of us
at least once during every practice.

322
00:25:05,382 --> 00:25:07,471
That's good.
Feedback's important.

323
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:09,218
It's key, I think.

324
00:25:10,164 --> 00:25:12,601
Hey, so how was
soccer practice?

325
00:25:16,688 --> 00:25:19,125
I think that
was in our backyard.

326
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,482
Who's there?

327
00:25:35,282 --> 00:25:37,779
What the hell are you
doing out here?

328
00:25:40,866 --> 00:25:42,049
Hey, Dad.

329
00:25:43,628 --> 00:25:44,870
Hey, Mom.

330
00:25:47,139 --> 00:25:49,342
You got new patio furniture.

331
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:51,888
Right on!

332
00:25:55,699 --> 00:25:56,800
My leg.

333
00:26:59,888 --> 00:27:02,108
What do you think
it could be?

334
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,593
God knows
I'm no expert.

335
00:27:05,831 --> 00:27:08,104
I don't know.
Uppers, downers?

336
00:27:08,206 --> 00:27:09,782
Your guess
is as good as mine.

337
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,858
I think we should check
his arms for needle marks.

338
00:27:16,852 --> 00:27:18,492
Do we let him stay?

339
00:27:19,163 --> 00:27:22,045
The Presbyterian Church
has those meetings.

340
00:27:22,415 --> 00:27:24,408
So maybe on condition,
you know?

341
00:27:24,438 --> 00:27:26,367
If he agrees to attend?

342
00:27:27,322 --> 00:27:29,830
I just don't know
what to tell Jake.

343
00:27:39,264 --> 00:27:40,454
Good evening.

344
00:27:41,721 --> 00:27:43,292
Well, sleep well?

345
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:47,152
What time's, uh...
What time is dinner?

346
00:27:48,886 --> 00:27:50,297
In about an hour.

347
00:27:54,204 --> 00:27:57,232
You know, I could wash
those clothes if you'd like.

348
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:59,370
They look a little lived in.

349
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:01,831
No, that's cool.

350
00:28:02,167 --> 00:28:03,550
Maybe later.

351
00:28:08,723 --> 00:28:10,562
We are not doing this again.

352
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,960
- Adam...
- No.

353
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:15,704
We said we'd lay down the law,
we lay down the law.

354
00:28:15,746 --> 00:28:18,331
We just have to be
consistent about it.

355
00:29:08,869 --> 00:29:10,725
You're not taking the bus?

356
00:29:14,414 --> 00:29:16,253
All right, well, listen.

357
00:29:17,052 --> 00:29:20,536
Give me maybe another 20 minutes
and we'll get out of here.

358
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:21,840
All right.

359
00:29:24,526 --> 00:29:25,651
Yeah, good.

360
00:29:56,972 --> 00:30:00,511
You know,
I just think that...

361
00:30:03,685 --> 00:30:06,800
things have a way
of working themselves out.

362
00:30:31,923 --> 00:30:33,784
When did you get this?

363
00:30:34,195 --> 00:30:36,513
Last May at
the year-end assembly.

364
00:30:36,623 --> 00:30:39,599
They gave me that one, too.
The one on the end.

365
00:30:41,121 --> 00:30:44,029
Environmental
Consciousness Award.

366
00:30:44,716 --> 00:30:48,265
What's that mean?
You, like, recycle cans and shit?

367
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:51,563
I contacted the Albuquerque Journal
and asked what chemicals

368
00:30:51,565 --> 00:30:55,012
they use to bleach their paper. They
wound up writing an article about it.

369
00:30:55,084 --> 00:30:56,818
Right on, little bro!

370
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,030
Making mad in-roads
with the business community.

371
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,311
All right!

372
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,406
Now, hey, remember,

373
00:31:03,788 --> 00:31:06,938
not all learning
comes out of books.

374
00:31:11,262 --> 00:31:12,481
Look at you.

375
00:31:13,716 --> 00:31:16,105
We should hang out more often.

376
00:31:16,376 --> 00:31:17,971
You know, just...

377
00:31:18,283 --> 00:31:20,251
just kick back and chill.

378
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:22,424
I mean, if you ever,

379
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:25,026
like, I don't know,
need advice.

380
00:31:26,312 --> 00:31:29,791
Because, yo, I mean,
I've been through it all. For real.

381
00:31:33,272 --> 00:31:34,763
Hey, man, you...

382
00:31:35,302 --> 00:31:36,990
You play the flute?

383
00:31:37,586 --> 00:31:39,233
It's a piccolo, actually.

384
00:31:39,244 --> 00:31:41,977
Dude, play some...
play some Jethro Tull.

385
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,897
Hey, guys.

386
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:47,570
How we doing in here?

387
00:31:48,275 --> 00:31:49,377
We're good.

388
00:31:53,524 --> 00:31:54,807
Yeah. Fine, Mom.

389
00:31:54,945 --> 00:31:56,600
Well, that's good.

390
00:31:57,034 --> 00:31:58,657
That's... That's great.

391
00:32:07,318 --> 00:32:08,466
What the hell?

392
00:32:09,063 --> 00:32:10,329
You see this?

393
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,975
What, am I some criminal
or something?

394
00:32:14,385 --> 00:32:16,268
- Whatever.
- Whatever?

395
00:32:17,234 --> 00:32:19,377
What, you think that's okay?

396
00:32:19,752 --> 00:32:22,026
Like, "Oh, we can't
let that scumbag

397
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,629
"warp the mind of
our favorite son."

398
00:32:25,464 --> 00:32:27,018
I'm the favorite?

399
00:32:28,075 --> 00:32:29,317
Yeah, right.

400
00:32:29,998 --> 00:32:32,998
You're practically
all they ever talk about.

401
00:34:10,005 --> 00:34:11,387
Oh, snap.

402
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:14,856
Awesome.

403
00:34:49,763 --> 00:34:51,131
Yo, man, it's me.

404
00:34:51,563 --> 00:34:54,120
Hey, listen.
You know, that product?

405
00:34:55,233 --> 00:34:56,944
You got any more of that?

406
00:34:57,103 --> 00:34:59,488
Nah, man, okay?
I'm done giving out freebies.

407
00:34:59,492 --> 00:35:01,886
You want charity,
go ask the Salvation Army.

408
00:35:01,947 --> 00:35:03,465
No, no charity.

409
00:35:03,797 --> 00:35:06,381
I got this cousin,
he's got him some rich friends.

410
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:09,251
These dudes are in town.
They're looking to par-tay.

411
00:35:09,425 --> 00:35:12,384
And your stuff is,
like, so sweet.

412
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,440
So what do you say?

413
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,546
You up for making
some fat stacks?

414
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:20,198
Because they'll buy
everything you got.

415
00:35:39,491 --> 00:35:41,225
You can't be serious.

416
00:35:42,761 --> 00:35:44,552
What the hell
are you doing here?

417
00:35:44,586 --> 00:35:46,656
Yo, I waited till
the bowl buster left.

418
00:35:46,713 --> 00:35:48,682
I mean, no offense.

419
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:52,402
Who sent you?

420
00:35:53,413 --> 00:35:55,915
You wearing a wire?
You setting me up?

421
00:35:57,136 --> 00:35:58,761
A wire?
You want a wire?

422
00:35:58,821 --> 00:36:01,409
I got a wire.
Speak into the mic, bitch!

423
00:36:01,694 --> 00:36:04,353
What the hell's wrong
with you? A wire.

424
00:36:08,388 --> 00:36:10,246
So who did you tell about...

425
00:36:10,388 --> 00:36:13,830
- Nobody. What are you, nuts?
- Then why are you here?

426
00:36:15,963 --> 00:36:17,299
I don't know.

427
00:36:17,913 --> 00:36:19,001
To, like...

428
00:36:19,464 --> 00:36:20,791
touch base.

429
00:36:21,705 --> 00:36:22,999
Touch base?

430
00:36:24,087 --> 00:36:25,566
Yeah, you know...

431
00:36:26,249 --> 00:36:27,657
what you call...

432
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,600
a debrief?

433
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,837
Maybe we could, like...

434
00:36:32,095 --> 00:36:34,058
I thought we could debrief.

435
00:36:34,161 --> 00:36:35,350
Debrief?

436
00:36:36,322 --> 00:36:37,478
Wow, that's...

437
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:40,827
that's what you think we need,
to debrief?

438
00:36:43,266 --> 00:36:47,198
Yeah, after what happened,
it just seems like the thing to do.

439
00:36:47,675 --> 00:36:49,728
Kind of, you know,
talk about it.

440
00:36:49,811 --> 00:36:52,541
We can't talk to anybody else.

441
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:56,814
Anyway, that,
and I wanted to...

442
00:36:57,165 --> 00:37:00,283
I wanted to tell you
how much everybody digs

443
00:37:00,962 --> 00:37:02,767
that meth we cooked.

444
00:37:02,896 --> 00:37:04,727
Everybody digs the meth...

445
00:37:05,232 --> 00:37:06,498
we cooked.

446
00:37:07,714 --> 00:37:09,254
Seriously, I got...

447
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:12,937
dudes that would give
their left nut for a little more.

448
00:37:13,955 --> 00:37:14,818
Great.

449
00:37:14,823 --> 00:37:17,094
I'm just saying, if you ever...

450
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:21,059
saw your way clear to...

451
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,681
You know, you and I...

452
00:37:24,506 --> 00:37:26,287
cooking a little more.

453
00:37:35,105 --> 00:37:36,885
Get the hell off my property.

454
00:37:36,907 --> 00:37:40,156
- What? I'm just saying.
- Go and don't come back.

455
00:37:40,468 --> 00:37:41,452
Now!

456
00:37:43,945 --> 00:37:44,963
All right.

457
00:37:46,107 --> 00:37:47,399
You know what?

458
00:37:48,186 --> 00:37:49,481
Four grand.

459
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:54,261
Your share
from selling that batch.

460
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,801
That's why I'm here.

461
00:37:57,803 --> 00:37:59,373
Yeah, that's right.

462
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,499
I didn't smoke it all.

463
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:27,253
Non-small cell adenocarcinoma.

464
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:28,940
Stage 3a,

465
00:38:28,948 --> 00:38:32,247
which means it's spread
from the lung to the lymph nodes.

466
00:38:32,338 --> 00:38:34,817
There's no denying
it's very serious.

467
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:36,928
But is it...

468
00:38:38,388 --> 00:38:39,622
It is...

469
00:38:40,992 --> 00:38:42,117
curable?

470
00:38:43,005 --> 00:38:45,155
I prefer the word "treatable."

471
00:38:46,045 --> 00:38:49,513
But the treatments we have at our
disposal can be very effective.

472
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:51,718
Without making any promises,
I can tell you that

473
00:38:51,721 --> 00:38:55,122
the specific course of radiation
and chemotherapy I'm going to suggest

474
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,823
has been successful.

475
00:38:56,848 --> 00:39:00,787
In certain cases, it prolonged patients'
lives and even resulted in remission.

476
00:39:03,222 --> 00:39:05,604
What about
the side effects?

477
00:39:05,813 --> 00:39:09,539
Well, they can be mild
to practically non-existent,

478
00:39:09,604 --> 00:39:11,670
or they can be
pretty darn awful.

479
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:13,489
It varies from patient to patient.

480
00:39:13,512 --> 00:39:15,413
Typically, there's hair loss,

481
00:39:15,477 --> 00:39:19,315
which begins a couple of weeks
after the start of chemotherapy.

482
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,949
You may find yourself unusually
fatigued, not much energy.

483
00:39:22,978 --> 00:39:24,840
You won't want
to get out of bed.

484
00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:28,739
You may lose weight due to reduced
appetite and certain intestinal issues.

485
00:39:29,054 --> 00:39:32,443
Muscle aches and pains,
gums get sore and bleed.

486
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:36,253
And, of course,
there's the possibility of nausea.

487
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:40,355
Although, we'll prescribe an anti-emetic
and try to counteract that.

488
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,328
Possible kidney
or bladder irritation.

489
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:45,126
You may wind up with
increased bruising and bleeding.

490
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:47,680
There may be sexual side effects.

491
00:39:47,726 --> 00:39:50,422
Your skin may become
dry and irritated...

492
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:20,980
Got anything to say?

493
00:40:28,157 --> 00:40:30,227
What do you know
about that?

494
00:40:31,226 --> 00:40:34,036
- Nothing.
- That's not going to fly this time.

495
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:36,598
How many chances
have we given you?

496
00:40:37,165 --> 00:40:39,441
How many times
have we sat right here

497
00:40:39,499 --> 00:40:41,701
and had the same conversation
over and over again

498
00:40:41,703 --> 00:40:44,501
where you look us in the eye
and you plead ignorance,

499
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:46,552
and you play
on our emotions,

500
00:40:46,584 --> 00:40:49,289
and you tell us anything
you think we want to hear

501
00:40:49,293 --> 00:40:52,148
just so we'll give you
another chance?

502
00:40:52,321 --> 00:40:55,986
And it makes us feel
like fools, every time.

503
00:41:00,703 --> 00:41:02,171
Enough, Jesse.

504
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,662
Enough.

505
00:41:05,905 --> 00:41:08,717
We are not going
to have this in our house.

506
00:41:10,071 --> 00:41:11,827
We need you to leave.

507
00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:54,077
Thanks for not telling on me.

508
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:01,130
You think
I could have it back?

509
00:42:15,854 --> 00:42:17,642
It's skunk weed anyway.

510
00:42:42,186 --> 00:42:44,977
You know,
this is actually very hopeful.

511
00:42:51,532 --> 00:42:52,999
Did you hear me?

512
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:56,555
I said this is really
very, very hopeful.

513
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:05,065
Can I call them and tell them
you'll start next week?

514
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:22,746
I just think that we need to...

515
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:25,486
discuss it a little more,
that's all.

516
00:43:25,494 --> 00:43:27,807
What is there to discuss?

517
00:43:27,877 --> 00:43:30,024
You're going to get
the best treatment

518
00:43:30,123 --> 00:43:31,835
and he's the best.

519
00:43:31,895 --> 00:43:33,807
Well, there's the money discussion.

520
00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:37,250
$90,000 out of pocket.

521
00:43:37,413 --> 00:43:39,645
- Maybe more.
- There's a way, Walt.

522
00:43:39,661 --> 00:43:43,336
There's financing,
there's installment plans.

523
00:43:43,468 --> 00:43:45,558
I could always go back to work.

524
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:47,735
Walt, there's always a way.

525
00:43:47,765 --> 00:43:48,812
All right.

526
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:51,975
Skyler, say that
there is a way.

527
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,962
And we spend
all that money, and...

528
00:44:07,233 --> 00:44:10,561
Am I supposed to leave you
with all that debt?

529
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:17,395
I just don't want
emotions ruling us.

530
00:44:19,053 --> 00:44:21,633
Maybe treatment
isn't the way to go.

531
00:44:23,186 --> 00:44:26,467
Then why don't you just
fucking die already?

532
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,464
Just give up and die.

533
00:45:21,556 --> 00:45:23,290
Come on, move your ass.

534
00:45:26,602 --> 00:45:28,042
What do I care?

535
00:45:29,284 --> 00:45:32,471
Yeah, I'm not worried.
I have the best fucking attorney.

536
00:45:32,916 --> 00:45:35,634
I would not want to be
on the other side of this one...

537
00:46:54,685 --> 00:46:56,051
What the hell?

538
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:06,351
What are you doing?
Call somebody, call the fire people.

539
00:47:08,483 --> 00:47:11,410
I don't believe it.
You know how much I paid for that?

540
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,957
Why is it doing this?
