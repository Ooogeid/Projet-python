<i>Previously on</i> Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:04,378
Mr. Pinkman, last chance.

3
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,131
<i>Is your wife Marie Schrader?</i>

4
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:09,550
You had my wife's name!

5
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,310
You're suspended.
Hand over your badge and your gun.

6
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,388
Pinkman isn't pressing charges.

7
00:00:19,155 --> 00:00:22,396
<i>Two men are coming to kill you.
You have one minute.</i>

8
00:01:47,777 --> 00:01:50,218
You'll be okay
waiting here by yourself?

9
00:01:52,836 --> 00:01:53,988
Whatever.

10
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:56,489
Sir,

11
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,291
if you'd like to smoke, you need
to be another 20 feet from the door.

12
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:01,862
So roll me further, bitch.

13
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,630
- What's coming?
- Male Caucasian.

14
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:29,231
Early 40s.
Multiple gunshot wounds.

15
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:35,266
BP is 70. 7-0 over palp.

16
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,800
Pulse 140... 1-4-0.

17
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:39,450
Weak and thready at the brachial.

18
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,077
No breath sounds on the right side,
and the belly is rigid.

19
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,914
Patient appears pale
and diaphoretic.

20
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,811
- How many entry wounds?
- We found four...

21
00:02:45,936 --> 00:02:49,034
shoulder and hip, through and through.
Right lung and lower left quadrant,

22
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,712
no visible exit wounds.

23
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:52,842
Let's give him 2 grams of oxygen.

24
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:55,216
- What's his hemoglobin?
- 7.3.

25
00:02:56,115 --> 00:02:57,594
I need two large-bore Ivs,

26
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,079
6 units O-neg,
type and cross for 6 more units,

27
00:03:00,204 --> 00:03:02,066
Chest X-ray and KUB.

28
00:03:02,191 --> 00:03:04,350
Notify the O.R.
we are on the way.

29
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,229
O.R. One is clear.
Let's put him in there.

30
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,387
Sorry I'm late, man.

31
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:46,910
Damn, brother, look at you.

32
00:03:47,035 --> 00:03:48,389
That's messed up.

33
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,689
How are you feeling?
You okay?

34
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:53,257
Actually...

35
00:03:55,955 --> 00:03:56,955
I'm great.

38
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:22,587
I don't understand.

39
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:25,264
I thought things were
going pretty well.

40
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:26,631
I...

41
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:29,186
I thought we were kind of simpatico,

42
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:30,454
you know?

43
00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:32,759
We were becoming a real team.

44
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,694
Not so much, no.

45
00:04:38,013 --> 00:04:39,790
Is this about
the temperature setting?

46
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:42,399
Because I can assure you
that will not happen...

47
00:04:42,524 --> 00:04:44,268
No, it's bigger than that.

48
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:45,564
It's... It's...

49
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,162
much more than that.

50
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:50,436
Could you elaborate?

51
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:53,365
Yes, of course I could, but

52
00:04:54,196 --> 00:04:56,293
I don't think either of us

53
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,020
would necessarily benefit
from a prolonged...

54
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:03,844
So...

55
00:05:05,549 --> 00:05:07,163
I set up the entire lab.

56
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:10,694
You said you liked
the configuration.

57
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:11,882
And I do.

58
00:05:13,075 --> 00:05:14,688
For the most part.

59
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:18,435
Look, you're a fine chemist, really,

60
00:05:18,657 --> 00:05:20,137
with a promising future.

61
00:05:20,262 --> 00:05:21,660
It's just that...

62
00:05:21,785 --> 00:05:23,113
that I...

63
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:24,902
that... that we

64
00:05:25,027 --> 00:05:27,013
just have

65
00:05:27,138 --> 00:05:28,545
different...

66
00:05:28,884 --> 00:05:29,787
Rhythms.

67
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:31,830
It's...

68
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:35,067
It's as if I'm

69
00:05:35,192 --> 00:05:36,620
classical

70
00:05:37,106 --> 00:05:38,906
but you are... are more...

71
00:05:41,203 --> 00:05:42,216
Jazz.

72
00:05:46,455 --> 00:05:49,181
And God knows there is
nothing wrong with jazz.

73
00:05:49,795 --> 00:05:51,404
It's simply

74
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:52,553
that I

75
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:54,435
require...

76
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:56,063
Classical.

77
00:05:57,076 --> 00:05:57,940
Exactly.

78
00:06:00,878 --> 00:06:01,701
Shit.

79
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:04,605
Man, this is the bomb.

80
00:06:12,554 --> 00:06:14,456
What's up, partner?

81
00:06:18,176 --> 00:06:20,471
- I can't believe this.
- This is my replacement?

82
00:06:20,596 --> 00:06:21,596
Jesus.

83
00:06:25,568 --> 00:06:27,437
- Nice to meet you.
- What's up?

84
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:30,107
Damn, we should have
ditched that RV months ago.

85
00:06:30,232 --> 00:06:32,482
It's all, like, shining up in here.

86
00:06:36,432 --> 00:06:39,371
I'm sorry. I must be missing something.
I don't mean to be...

87
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,159
This...

88
00:06:44,212 --> 00:06:46,572
... makes no sense.

89
00:06:53,982 --> 00:06:54,982
So...

90
00:06:57,078 --> 00:06:58,865
I guess this is...

91
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:04,999
Dear mother of God.

92
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,220
This is for the best.

93
00:07:11,004 --> 00:07:12,716
200 pounds a week.

94
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,058
Got it?

95
00:07:16,578 --> 00:07:17,635
Man!

96
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:35,537
Okay. There's a lot to show you.

97
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,680
Some new techniques to learn.

98
00:07:38,315 --> 00:07:39,583
What, now?

99
00:07:40,234 --> 00:07:41,281
Yes, now.

100
00:07:41,937 --> 00:07:43,280
We've only got a couple days

101
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:46,632
before our next batch is due,
and I need to get you up to speed.

102
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,110
Right on.

103
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,436
I'm just saying...

104
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,859
How's the cell service down here?

105
00:07:56,152 --> 00:07:57,643
It's nonexistent.

106
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,296
We're shielded.

107
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,772
There's a hard line
for emergencies. Come on.

108
00:08:01,957 --> 00:08:04,368
So you haven't talked
to anybody today

109
00:08:04,493 --> 00:08:06,944
other than, you know,
Captain Nerd there.

110
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,112
Why?

111
00:08:10,504 --> 00:08:11,901
Your brother-in-law.

112
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,493
What about him?

113
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,040
Upon arrival, he was unresponsive.

114
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,334
You getting some exposure
on those wounds?

115
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:24,778
- 2 units of normal saline.
- We've got a bivalve mass.

116
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:27,758
He's got breath sounds bilaterally.
This femur is like a wet bag of gravel.

117
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,384
The other one's not much better.
Let's get those boots off.

118
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,663
See if you get a pulse.
You get a blood pressure cup or an ABI?

119
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:34,930
Where's that blood?

120
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,239
Sir, can I help you?

121
00:08:43,157 --> 00:08:44,641
It's all right.
He's family.

122
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:50,047
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

123
00:08:56,545 --> 00:08:57,661
I'm so sorry.

124
00:08:58,387 --> 00:08:59,980
I don't know what to say.

125
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:08,514
How is he?

126
00:09:09,034 --> 00:09:12,222
I don't know. They won't really tell us
anything and he's still in surgery.

127
00:09:14,062 --> 00:09:15,812
They shot him four times.

128
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,980
Christ.

129
00:09:24,406 --> 00:09:25,482
Where's Holly?

130
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:27,408
I got a sitter.

131
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,554
- How are you?
- Fine.

132
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,584
Sure?

133
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:40,754
I'm fine. I just need
some fresh air.

134
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:47,194
- Here. Let me get the door.
- I got it.

135
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:48,492
I'm fine.

136
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,146
This is ASAC Merkert.

137
00:09:56,271 --> 00:09:57,596
Hank's brother-in-law Walt.

138
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:00,050
I'm very sorry.

139
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:01,118
Thank you.

140
00:10:01,658 --> 00:10:04,821
Can you tell us anything
or any details?

141
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:07,591
Right now, all we know
is two men ambushed Hank.

142
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,776
They didn't have any I.D. on them.
Probably Mexican nationals.

143
00:10:11,764 --> 00:10:15,364
Their tattoos indicated
an affiliation with the drug cartel.

144
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:19,803
Why did they attack Hank?

145
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,471
We're not sure yet.

146
00:10:21,877 --> 00:10:24,007
It could be in relation

147
00:10:24,132 --> 00:10:25,909
to an investigation
that Hank was working,

148
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:29,379
or it could be a message
to the DEA in general.

149
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,091
They had an ax.

150
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:37,549
The cartels tend to be dramatic.

151
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:40,555
Jesus.

152
00:10:43,588 --> 00:10:46,173
- Where are they? Did they...
- Hank got both of them.

153
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,084
He killed one outright,

154
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:50,315
and the other one's upstairs
in critical condition.

155
00:10:50,663 --> 00:10:52,716
Your brother-in-law's
one tough son of a bitch

156
00:10:52,841 --> 00:10:54,428
to take them both out,

157
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,016
considering he didn't
even have his gun.

158
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,669
He didn't have his gun?

159
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:08,369
Why didn't Hank have his gun?

160
00:11:10,886 --> 00:11:12,155
The assault charge.

161
00:11:12,595 --> 00:11:15,239
I had to suspend Hank
pending the investigation.

162
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:17,864
That means I had to
take away his weapon.

163
00:11:20,318 --> 00:11:23,200
- It's standard procedure. No one...
- Okay, All right. Listen.

164
00:11:23,325 --> 00:11:26,226
If you would have all listened
to him right from the start,

165
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,205
and let him arrest
that little degenerate,

166
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,475
he wouldn't have had to take
things into his own hands,

167
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,593
and he would have had a gun
and defended himself.

168
00:11:34,156 --> 00:11:35,636
- Let's just...
- No. Just...

169
00:11:38,194 --> 00:11:39,583
It's their fault.

170
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:42,118
He didn't have a gun.

171
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,221
Honey, this isn't helping you.

172
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,583
You.

173
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,782
What kind of partner are you?

174
00:11:50,914 --> 00:11:53,964
You were supposed to back him up,
and where were you?

175
00:11:54,511 --> 00:11:55,999
Where were you?

176
00:11:56,544 --> 00:11:57,791
Texas.

177
00:12:00,128 --> 00:12:01,128
And you.

178
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:04,246
You're supposed to
protect your agents

179
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:07,110
instead of taking their guns,

180
00:12:07,235 --> 00:12:08,545
not supporting them,

181
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,185
not backing them up...

182
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,615
when they...

183
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,119
Honey, let's just go
and sit down, okay?

184
00:12:16,741 --> 00:12:18,054
I'm not doing anything

185
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:20,290
until these two get
the hell out of here.

186
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:21,365
I mean it.

187
00:12:27,482 --> 00:12:28,747
Sorry... Go.

188
00:12:29,327 --> 00:12:31,067
You are not welcome here.

189
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:34,206
The DEA is not welcome here.

190
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,740
Come on.

191
00:12:37,064 --> 00:12:38,766
Come on. Let's go sit down.

192
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:53,447
It's not just them.

193
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:57,013
It's you, Walt.

194
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,900
This Pinkman

195
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:08,781
that Hank was looking for...

196
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,343
Hank would have never
even heard his name

197
00:13:12,254 --> 00:13:15,438
if you hadn't bought
marijuana from him.

198
00:13:16,834 --> 00:13:18,839
Do you ever think about that, Walt?

199
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,330
Do you?

200
00:13:21,328 --> 00:13:23,769
Do you ever think about everything
that you have put him through?

201
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:25,989
Stop.

202
00:13:26,757 --> 00:13:27,907
You're upset,

203
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,954
and you're looking for someone to blame,
and it's understandable,

204
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:32,602
but don't blame Walt.

205
00:13:33,015 --> 00:13:34,675
It's not his fault.

206
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:43,440
I'm sorry.

207
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:44,974
I'm sorry.

208
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:46,408
Sweetheart. No.
Don't...

209
00:13:51,684 --> 00:13:52,749
It's okay.

210
00:13:53,092 --> 00:13:54,218
It's Hank...

211
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:56,259
It's all right.

212
00:14:12,244 --> 00:14:13,998
All right, you're done.

213
00:14:17,082 --> 00:14:18,482
Okay, next.

214
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,561
Jesse Pinkman in the house!

215
00:16:23,742 --> 00:16:24,631
My...

216
00:16:24,756 --> 00:16:26,343
dear...

217
00:16:26,468 --> 00:16:27,260
God.

218
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:06,193
<i>Walter White to the nearest
courtesy phone.</i>

219
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,908
<i>Walter White, please
pick up a courtesy phone.</i>

220
00:17:21,537 --> 00:17:24,578
<i>We working sometime this year?</i>

221
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:28,044
What the hell are you thinking?
Why are you calling me here?

222
00:17:28,169 --> 00:17:30,903
I tried your cell, and it
went straight to voice mail.

223
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:33,753
- How am I supposed to get hold of you?
- You aren't.

224
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:36,930
<i>Look, man, it's been a whole day.
How long is this grieving process?</i>

225
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,765
Just put a clock on it for me.

226
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:41,862
<i>All's I'm saying is
we have a schedule, right?</i>

227
00:17:41,987 --> 00:17:44,533
My family comes
before your schedule.

228
00:17:44,658 --> 00:17:46,773
<i>Dude, it's not my schedule.</i>

229
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,535
We have responsibilities here.

230
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,760
<i>I'll get there when I get there.</i>

231
00:17:52,103 --> 00:17:53,740
You know what? Whatever.

232
00:17:54,293 --> 00:17:56,743
I'll just cook on my own.
You will do no such thing.

233
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:57,868
<i>Why not?</i>

234
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,181
<i>For starters,</i>

235
00:18:01,306 --> 00:18:04,259
you aren't the least bit familiar
with any of the equipment.

236
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:07,044
<i>There's got to be some
sort of manual, right?</i>

237
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,701
And I can read.

238
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,367
- Touch nothing.
- <i>Stop treating me</i>

239
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:14,161
I'm like your assistant.
I'm not your bitch to order around.

240
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:16,390
We're partners.
Remember?

241
00:18:16,615 --> 00:18:18,763
I need you

242
00:18:18,888 --> 00:18:20,056
to sit patiently

243
00:18:20,494 --> 00:18:22,836
and wait, and I will be there
as soon as I can.

244
00:18:22,961 --> 00:18:25,005
Thank you very much
for your kind words.

245
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,973
We... We really do appreciate that.

246
00:18:27,098 --> 00:18:28,675
What, is your wife there?

247
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,035
<i>Uh, yes. Yes, she is,</i>

248
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,880
and she would be happy to know
that you asked about her.

249
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,698
Please do keep us in your thoughts.

250
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,884
Tell your douche-bag brother-in-law

251
00:18:38,009 --> 00:18:39,476
to head towards the light.

252
00:18:42,843 --> 00:18:44,229
So I'm thinking, um,

253
00:18:44,354 --> 00:18:46,291
maybe we should go get
everybody some breakfast.

254
00:18:46,484 --> 00:18:48,319
Yeah. That sounds good.

255
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,436
Do you know who that was?

256
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:06,385
You know,

257
00:19:06,648 --> 00:19:10,035
these eggs are really not too bad.

258
00:19:24,475 --> 00:19:25,288
Look.

259
00:19:25,942 --> 00:19:27,707
- Look at what?
- At what?

260
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:30,001
This.
These spots.

261
00:19:30,304 --> 00:19:32,354
This fork is absolutely filthy.

262
00:19:37,235 --> 00:19:38,785
Tell me you see this.

263
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,846
You've got good eyes.
Look at that.

264
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,903
Those are just water spots.

265
00:19:44,276 --> 00:19:45,183
Fork is fine.

266
00:19:45,676 --> 00:19:47,476
Those are not water spots.

267
00:19:48,204 --> 00:19:49,304
That's dirt.

268
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:54,157
This silverware's
obviously not been cleaned.

269
00:19:54,282 --> 00:19:57,232
It's covered in germs
from someone else's mouth.

270
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:58,906
God knows what.

271
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,889
Seriously, Aunt Marie,

272
00:20:02,014 --> 00:20:03,364
it's water spots.

273
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:06,432
Ours at home aren't any better.

274
00:20:07,322 --> 00:20:08,935
Yours at home are irrelevant.

275
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,359
We're in a hospital.

276
00:20:10,484 --> 00:20:13,745
They need a higher standard.
They have a responsibility.

277
00:20:14,425 --> 00:20:17,007
I'm not actually sure
if the cafeteria necessarily

278
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,276
qualifies
as being part of a hospital.

279
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:20,777
It's in the same building.

280
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,706
It's all under the same roof.

281
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:24,994
Do you think
that sick people aren't eating

282
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:27,071
with this bacteria-infected
silverware?

283
00:20:27,196 --> 00:20:29,947
My God, how are you supposed
to survive this death trap?

284
00:20:38,067 --> 00:20:39,117
I survived.

285
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,533
I had my lumpectomy
at this hospital.

286
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:44,901
Remember that?

287
00:20:46,301 --> 00:20:48,401
Remember how scared we all were?

288
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:51,624
I didn't want to act like it,

289
00:20:51,973 --> 00:20:53,944
but I was terrified.

290
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,850
All that week,

291
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,592
all I could think of
was how they were actually going to

292
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,260
cut me open

293
00:21:03,142 --> 00:21:05,739
and take out a part of me

294
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,949
that was with me my entire life.

295
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,895
I couldn't get that image
out of my head.

296
00:21:14,084 --> 00:21:17,047
I think the scariest part
was when...

297
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:20,333
They took me into pre-op,

298
00:21:21,308 --> 00:21:22,408
lying there,

299
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,985
waiting for them to anesthetize you,

300
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,073
knowing that...

301
00:21:29,258 --> 00:21:31,158
You may never wake up again.

302
00:21:38,037 --> 00:21:39,037
Actually,

303
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,973
what I really remember
about that day

304
00:21:43,098 --> 00:21:45,541
is driving to the hospital.

305
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,473
You remember me
wanting to drive that day?

306
00:21:51,172 --> 00:21:52,769
Anyway, there we are.

307
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,687
We're driving up Central,

308
00:21:55,135 --> 00:21:57,744
and we hit every green light...

309
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,902
Every single light that we hit...

310
00:22:02,652 --> 00:22:03,446
green.

311
00:22:05,856 --> 00:22:06,991
When does that happen?

312
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,046
Just like bang, bang,

313
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,047
green the entire way.

314
00:22:14,103 --> 00:22:16,501
And the whole time,
all I could think about

315
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:19,405
was "Why today?

316
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:24,836
"Why can't I just spend
a few extra minutes

317
00:22:24,961 --> 00:22:26,803
"in the car with my family?"

318
00:22:29,491 --> 00:22:32,841
I never wanted to be stuck
in traffic so bad in my life.

319
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,958
At least I was with my family.

320
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:40,684
I had that.

321
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:46,990
Anyway,

322
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,071
I survived this place.

323
00:22:51,966 --> 00:22:54,566
And I'm not half the man
your husband is.

324
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,823
I was going to ask you
the same question.

325
00:23:31,233 --> 00:23:34,129
<i>I heard that they attacked a DEA agent.
Why would they do that?</i>

326
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:43,859
I didn't order this, and my men
would never do this on their own.

327
00:23:43,984 --> 00:23:45,844
Someone gave the go-ahead.

328
00:23:46,974 --> 00:23:48,474
<i>Are you accusing me?</i>

329
00:23:49,714 --> 00:23:52,018
I'm just saying
they wouldn't act on their own.

330
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,847
I am not in the habit
of picking my own pocket.

331
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:57,518
I assume

332
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,752
<i>that the next shipment
will be delayed.</i>

333
00:23:59,877 --> 00:24:01,475
<i>Any thoughts
on when it might arrive?</i>

334
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,416
A week, a month.

335
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,443
There's too much
focus on the border.

336
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,625
We lay low for the time being.

337
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,908
We lay low,

338
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:11,491
and then we get the real story
from my man who survived.

339
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,875
Your man is in custody.

340
00:24:16,012 --> 00:24:18,742
He's innocent until proven guilty.
Correct?

341
00:24:18,867 --> 00:24:20,458
I'll get him the best lawyer,

342
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,495
<i>and then we'll learn the truth.</i>

343
00:24:23,402 --> 00:24:24,752
Keep me apprised.

344
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,802
Any time you've got that close
proximity to the spine,

345
00:24:31,927 --> 00:24:35,300
there's always going to be cause
for concern, but, as I say,

346
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:37,210
it's really too soon to tell.

347
00:24:37,335 --> 00:24:39,560
He's out of surgery,
at least, which is...

348
00:24:39,685 --> 00:24:41,395
Out of surgery,
on his way to recovery.

349
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:43,554
All right.
Where's that?

350
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,525
Unfortunately,
you can't see him just yet.

351
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,860
We're gonna have to wait
for him to stabilize.

352
00:24:48,746 --> 00:24:50,446
How long will that take?

353
00:24:50,918 --> 00:24:53,218
I can't really say.
Could be hours,

354
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:56,661
but we'll let you know
just as soon as you could see him.

355
00:24:58,171 --> 00:24:59,171
Thank you.

356
00:25:05,832 --> 00:25:08,585
Maybe we should get you home
for a couple hours?

357
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,910
Get some rest?

358
00:25:11,157 --> 00:25:12,807
I'm not going anywhere.

359
00:25:14,411 --> 00:25:15,304
Me, neither.

360
00:25:23,116 --> 00:25:25,309
Is anyone else dying
to brush their teeth,

361
00:25:25,434 --> 00:25:26,784
or is it just me?

362
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,737
What if I ran over to the house
and picked up a few things?

363
00:25:33,161 --> 00:25:34,650
I could swing by your place.

364
00:25:34,775 --> 00:25:36,182
That would be great.

365
00:25:36,307 --> 00:25:37,457
Thanks, Walt.

366
00:25:58,579 --> 00:26:00,558
We just heard he came through?

367
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:04,355
Yeah, well, it's...
You know, guardedly good news.

368
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,013
Thank God.
I'll take it.

369
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,650
Hey, guys, this is
Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.

370
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:14,155
We were just swapping Hank stories.

371
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,693
That could go on all day.

372
00:26:15,818 --> 00:26:18,117
God knows,
there's a million of them.

373
00:26:19,931 --> 00:26:20,912
Meanwhile...

374
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:23,206
Miserable piece of shit.

375
00:26:23,658 --> 00:26:25,983
Guy who shot him,
the one that's left, he's up there,

376
00:26:26,108 --> 00:26:29,172
got the painkillers going on,
resting comfortably.

377
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:30,755
Your tax dollars at work.

378
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:33,424
You ought to see what
Hank did to that bastard.

379
00:26:35,212 --> 00:26:36,312
Want to see?

380
00:26:38,576 --> 00:26:40,326
Come on, let me show you.

381
00:27:01,392 --> 00:27:03,371
You comfortable, you piece of shit?

382
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,388
You got him?

383
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:03,556
Come on.

384
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,739
Easy, easy.

385
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,379
Fallacies

386
00:28:58,902 --> 00:29:00,780
Fallacies

387
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:04,158
One for you and two for...

388
00:29:52,231 --> 00:29:54,959
Finally.
About damn time.

389
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:09,493
Why isn't there anything cooking?

390
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,076
<i>Walter White
to the nearest courtesy phone.</i>

391
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:32,815
- <i>Operator.</i>
- This is Walter White.

392
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,290
<i>I'll connect you.</i>

393
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:40,211
<i>We got problems, big ones.</i>

394
00:30:40,928 --> 00:30:44,508
Reverend, so nice of you to call...
Again.

395
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,082
Turn your phone on already.

396
00:30:46,207 --> 00:30:49,305
<i>You know,
I will definitely look into that.</i>

397
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:53,608
I'll tell you what. Why don't I just
call you right back on my cell phone.

398
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:58,491
I told you to wait.

399
00:30:58,616 --> 00:31:00,587
I don't know how many more ways
I could say it.

400
00:31:00,712 --> 00:31:02,564
<i>Yeah, dick, I was waiting,</i>

401
00:31:02,689 --> 00:31:05,092
<i>and then that creepy,
quiet guy showed up.</i>

402
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:08,634
- Gus came by?
- Not him, man.

403
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:10,867
Apparently
I'm not worthy of meeting him.

404
00:31:10,992 --> 00:31:13,861
It was the other one, the one
that I'm qualified to speak to.

405
00:31:13,986 --> 00:31:15,372
He started asking questions,

406
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,397
<i>like why I haven't cooked anything.</i>

407
00:31:18,066 --> 00:31:19,376
<i>We have a quota.</i>

408
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:21,612
It's due tomorrow.

409
00:31:21,737 --> 00:31:23,297
Do you seriously not care, or what?

410
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:26,557
<i>Because that guy, he's got,
like, the dead eyes.</i>

411
00:31:26,682 --> 00:31:28,077
Let me ask you something.

412
00:31:28,202 --> 00:31:31,058
Do you remember when we were out
in the desert with Tuco?

413
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,382
You mean when he put
a machinegun to my head?

414
00:31:34,507 --> 00:31:37,102
Yeah, I think that does ring
a tiny bell. Why?

415
00:31:37,972 --> 00:31:41,163
He kept saying that someone

416
00:31:41,288 --> 00:31:43,852
was coming up from Mexico to get us.

417
00:31:43,977 --> 00:31:46,595
Do you remember?
Now, who was that?

418
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,664
<i>What has this even got to do with...</i>

419
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,824
I don't know.
It was...

420
00:31:54,251 --> 00:31:55,351
His cousins.

421
00:31:56,028 --> 00:31:59,154
Right, Jesse?
It was his cousins.

422
00:32:00,678 --> 00:32:01,678
Cousins.

423
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,587
Whatever, man. Why?

424
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:23,798
Any news?

425
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,470
No change.

426
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:34,618
I didn't know whose
toothbrushes were whose, so I...

427
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,886
I just stopped by the drugstore.

428
00:32:38,063 --> 00:32:40,263
Thank God for travel sizes, right?

429
00:32:49,162 --> 00:32:51,562
I think I'm going to go
wash my face.

430
00:32:51,718 --> 00:32:53,018
I'm going crazy.

431
00:32:54,609 --> 00:32:56,109
Do you want to come?

432
00:33:14,027 --> 00:33:15,377
I got candy bars.

433
00:33:20,883 --> 00:33:22,806
Is this what you were asking for?

434
00:33:27,081 --> 00:33:29,630
I skimmed through it.
Looks interesting.

435
00:33:31,735 --> 00:33:33,485
Uncle Hank gave it to me.

436
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:39,616
What's it about?

437
00:33:43,245 --> 00:33:46,943
Pablo Escobar,
this big drug guy in the '80s.

438
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:50,986
I remember seeing him on the news.

439
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,158
It's more about the guys
who investigated him

440
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:58,727
and tried to bring him down.

441
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:01,203
Some of them were DEA, you know?

442
00:34:02,502 --> 00:34:06,499
Uncle Hank said
that they were worth learning about,

443
00:34:08,029 --> 00:34:10,661
that everybody knows
who Pablo Escobar is,

444
00:34:10,786 --> 00:34:14,036
but nobody knows about the guys
that brought him down.

445
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:18,471
I guess I never thought about it.

446
00:34:21,707 --> 00:34:25,625
He said that good guys

447
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,000
never get ink like the bad guys do.

448
00:34:36,937 --> 00:34:39,145
So he gave it to me.

449
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:41,929
Figured I'd read it.

450
00:34:56,579 --> 00:34:57,946
I need to...

451
00:34:58,689 --> 00:35:00,639
I'll be right back, okay?

452
00:35:07,663 --> 00:35:10,004
No, I assure you.
We are hard at work.

453
00:35:10,129 --> 00:35:11,179
Absolutely.

454
00:35:12,442 --> 00:35:15,492
<i>So I can expect delivery
by tomorrow as scheduled.</i>

455
00:35:18,798 --> 00:35:20,409
No. Unfortunately...

456
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,060
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

457
00:35:22,675 --> 00:35:24,204
<i>we're not going to be able</i>

458
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,480
to keep our schedule this week.

459
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,001
But not for lack of trying.

460
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:30,931
Is there something I should know?

461
00:35:32,771 --> 00:35:35,021
To be completely honest with you...

462
00:35:36,295 --> 00:35:38,095
Gale really screwed us up.

463
00:35:38,934 --> 00:35:41,901
I mean, not on purpose, of course,
but he just...

464
00:35:42,026 --> 00:35:45,299
He set us way back, and we've
been playing catch-up ever since.

465
00:35:48,226 --> 00:35:51,079
And I've had to be out
running errands

466
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,776
<i>and trying to keep us on target.</i>

467
00:35:55,766 --> 00:35:58,312
Some of the equipment
wasn't calibrated correctly and...

468
00:35:58,437 --> 00:36:01,507
It's just all very technical
and boring,

469
00:36:01,632 --> 00:36:04,007
but rest assured that...

470
00:36:05,016 --> 00:36:07,154
that we will do whatever it takes.

471
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,499
<i>It has my total attention.</i>

472
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:11,993
<i>We'll cook through
the weekend if necessary.</i>

473
00:36:12,976 --> 00:36:16,472
We will have 400 pounds
for you by next week.

474
00:36:20,915 --> 00:36:22,470
I have your word on that?

475
00:36:22,863 --> 00:36:23,925
You do.

476
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,800
You have my word on that.

477
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:29,381
<i>Thank you for the update.</i>

478
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,704
Any news?

479
00:36:59,365 --> 00:37:01,402
I'm just wandering.

480
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:04,566
How's everybody doing?

481
00:37:04,691 --> 00:37:07,169
Well, as well as can be expected.

482
00:37:07,998 --> 00:37:10,833
It's this not knowing

483
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:13,346
that's the hardest part, I think.

484
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:16,875
Anything new on these guys?

485
00:37:17,581 --> 00:37:19,527
Who they are?
What they wanted?

486
00:37:19,774 --> 00:37:21,762
No, nothing yet,

487
00:37:21,887 --> 00:37:23,237
but we'll get it.

488
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,840
Steve...

489
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,209
Do you think
there could maybe be others?

490
00:37:35,675 --> 00:37:38,547
Buddy, nobody's getting to Hank.

491
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:41,154
That was their one shot,
and they blew it.

492
00:37:44,665 --> 00:37:45,665
No way.

493
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:52,603
I'd love to walk in there and
shoot that bastard right in the head.

494
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:53,771
Me, too.

495
00:38:06,477 --> 00:38:08,435
Great. We'll be right down.

496
00:38:09,176 --> 00:38:10,276
Food's here.

497
00:38:11,277 --> 00:38:13,027
You like Pollos Hermanos?

498
00:38:16,348 --> 00:38:17,545
On occasion, yeah.

499
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,963
Owner's a big booster for the DEA.
He heard what happened.

500
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,423
He's going to feed
every cop in the building.

501
00:38:24,382 --> 00:38:25,675
That's wonderful.

502
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,950
Yeah, and apparently
he's bringing it by personally.

503
00:38:36,061 --> 00:38:38,857
- I don't even know what to say.
- That's an incredible...

504
00:38:38,982 --> 00:38:39,982
Good?

505
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,908
Delicious.

506
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:44,606
That's so generous of you.
Thank you very much.

507
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:46,324
Yes, thank you.

508
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:50,256
Guys, did you hear that?
Mr. Fring is offering a $10,000 reward

509
00:38:50,381 --> 00:38:52,581
on any information about the case.

510
00:38:54,829 --> 00:38:56,179
That's wonderful.

511
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,585
Thank you, Mr. Fring.

512
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,467
You're very welcome.

513
00:39:00,592 --> 00:39:02,506
Men like your husband
are the thin blue line

514
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,483
between us and these animals.

515
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:05,926
I only wish I could do more.

516
00:39:11,857 --> 00:39:13,843
We do appreciate your support.

517
00:39:13,968 --> 00:39:16,296
This reward
could turn the tide here.

518
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:17,821
It'll really help.

519
00:39:19,195 --> 00:39:19,982
Again,

520
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,200
I can't express how sorry I am.

521
00:39:22,738 --> 00:39:24,861
As it happens,
I actually met Agent Schrader.

522
00:39:26,177 --> 00:39:26,989
Really?

523
00:39:27,643 --> 00:39:29,199
Our fun run, a couple months ago.

524
00:39:30,386 --> 00:39:32,586
Mr. Fring was one of our sponsors.

525
00:39:33,767 --> 00:39:36,567
I talked for a few minutes
with your husband.

526
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:38,709
As a matter of fact,

527
00:39:39,113 --> 00:39:41,063
Mr. White, your name came up.

528
00:39:44,277 --> 00:39:45,277
Really?

529
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:50,185
There happened to be
a collection jar out for you,

530
00:39:50,646 --> 00:39:53,423
and we spoke briefly
about your health concerns.

531
00:39:53,548 --> 00:39:55,798
I hope that there's been good news.

532
00:39:59,415 --> 00:40:01,375
Things have improved, yes.

533
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:03,629
That's wonderful to hear.

534
00:40:04,523 --> 00:40:07,116
It was clear to me
how deeply he cares for you.

535
00:40:11,627 --> 00:40:13,785
I've taken up enough of your time.

536
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,708
Thank you again very much.
It was a great pleasure to meet you.

537
00:40:20,222 --> 00:40:21,918
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

538
00:40:24,101 --> 00:40:26,851
- Let me walk you out.
- It's not necessary.

539
00:40:33,126 --> 00:40:36,114
You know, I didn't say thank you.

540
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,412
I'll walk him out.

541
00:40:37,537 --> 00:40:38,987
I'll be right back.

542
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:45,451
Enjoying the chicken?

543
00:40:53,012 --> 00:40:54,412
It's good chicken?

544
00:40:57,448 --> 00:40:59,155
I just wanted to thank you again.

545
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,630
It's my pleasure.

546
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,940
May I speak with you?

547
00:41:03,296 --> 00:41:04,496
Just a moment?

548
00:41:09,389 --> 00:41:10,389
You knew.

549
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:14,285
You knew my brother-in-law
was with the DEA.

550
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,266
I investigate everyone
with whom I do business.

551
00:41:18,747 --> 00:41:20,547
What careful man wouldn't?

552
00:41:21,738 --> 00:41:24,118
He is not a problem for us,

553
00:41:24,243 --> 00:41:25,593
for our business.

554
00:41:31,234 --> 00:41:32,364
Your being here is...

555
00:41:33,832 --> 00:41:35,782
Is this some sort of message?

556
00:41:36,144 --> 00:41:38,066
I'm supporting my community.

557
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:40,788
I hide in plain sight, same as you.

558
00:41:41,573 --> 00:41:44,292
- Are we done?
- This attack on my brother-in-law...

559
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,786
I don't understand it.

560
00:41:46,911 --> 00:41:48,880
I don't know what it means.

561
00:41:49,831 --> 00:41:53,149
Please, if you have some knowledge

562
00:41:53,274 --> 00:41:55,143
that you could share with me.

563
00:42:00,214 --> 00:42:01,764
I fear for my family.

564
00:42:02,752 --> 00:42:03,979
I'm sure they'll be fine.

565
00:42:04,507 --> 00:42:06,522
I am told the assassin that survived

566
00:42:06,647 --> 00:42:08,138
is gravely injured.

567
00:42:08,263 --> 00:42:10,013
It's doubtful he'll live.

568
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,620
Now thank me and shake my hand.

569
00:42:20,648 --> 00:42:22,548
Thank you.
Thank you again.

570
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,536
You're quite welcome, Mr. White.

571
00:42:35,831 --> 00:42:37,131
What's going on?

572
00:42:38,505 --> 00:42:39,855
What's happening?

573
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:43,575
Starting chest compressions.
One, two, three, four.

574
00:42:45,428 --> 00:42:47,564
- Defib?
- No reason. Patient is in asystole.

575
00:42:47,909 --> 00:42:49,732
Continuing chest compressions.

576
00:42:51,215 --> 00:42:53,695
- Give me a liter of saline wide open.
- I can't get a pulse back.

577
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,773
Still nothing.

578
00:42:56,904 --> 00:42:58,988
All right.
Stopping compressions.

579
00:42:59,113 --> 00:42:59,964
Time.

580
00:43:00,089 --> 00:43:01,089
8:43.

581
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,455
Time of death. 20:43.

582
00:43:05,725 --> 00:43:07,825
Burn in hell, you piece of shit.

583
00:43:36,649 --> 00:43:38,435
<i>I assume you heard the news.</i>

584
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,760
Your man died.

585
00:43:40,114 --> 00:43:41,177
I heard.

586
00:43:41,302 --> 00:43:42,430
It's unfortunate.

587
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,828
<i>Yeah, "unfortunate",</i>

588
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,946
and meanwhile,
I have <i>Federales</i> surrounding my house.

589
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,789
You know what I think, Gustavo?

590
00:43:49,391 --> 00:43:50,752
You're behind all this.

591
00:43:51,449 --> 00:43:54,425
Why would I do this?
How would it serve me?

592
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:56,683
That's the part
I'm trying to figure out.

593
00:43:56,808 --> 00:43:58,608
Go off on your own, maybe.

594
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:01,945
Would you actually think
that would work?

595
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:04,294
<i>You sound like
you're under a lot of stress.</i>

596
00:44:04,419 --> 00:44:07,185
Maybe you should call me back
when you're seeing things more clearly.

597
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:09,104
I see things clear enough.

598
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:12,732
One DEA gets shot.
All of Washington starts barking.

599
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,026
The D.F. suddenly
has to put on a big show,

600
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:18,093
<i>and I wind up with </i>Federals<i>
in my rose bushes.</i>

601
00:44:18,218 --> 00:44:19,823
<i>But just for a while.</i>

602
00:44:20,432 --> 00:44:21,908
Appearances,

603
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,076
politics.

604
00:44:24,771 --> 00:44:26,476
<i>Are you still there, Gustavo?</i>

605
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:29,499
I'm here.

606
00:44:30,614 --> 00:44:32,210
<i>I'll weather this.
I always do.</i>

607
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:34,130
My brother's a police chief.

608
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:36,715
I got connections.
They'll get me through.

609
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,383
And when I get proof

610
00:44:39,371 --> 00:44:41,971
and the others find out
what you've done,

611
00:44:42,709 --> 00:44:44,709
maybe we come pay you a visit.

612
00:44:45,633 --> 00:44:46,683
<i>Maybe we...</i>

613
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:42,238
How is he?
Tell me something good.

614
00:45:42,363 --> 00:45:45,920
I think he's stable enough now
for you to go see him briefly.

615
00:45:46,045 --> 00:45:48,297
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
it's immediate family only.

616
00:45:48,422 --> 00:45:49,412
We're all family.

617
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,564
I understand,

618
00:45:50,689 --> 00:45:53,041
but we have a certain protocol
here that we need...

619
00:45:53,529 --> 00:45:54,941
We're all family.
