1
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:32,808
- Good morning, Officer.
- Sir, can you turn the music down?

2
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:36,631
Down means off.

3
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,670
You know why I pulled
you over this morning?

4
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:45,168
Well...
I'm pretty sure I wasn't speeding.

5
00:02:45,293 --> 00:02:47,451
I've been using the cruise control,
so I...

6
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:49,084
No, sir. Your windshield.

7
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,099
License and registration, please.

8
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:55,974
Right.

9
00:03:00,726 --> 00:03:03,810
This was from Wayfarer 515.

10
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,102
My house was in the debris field.

11
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:13,660
And that's
what shattered my windshield...

12
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:16,313
some piece of wreckage
from the plane.

13
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:17,588
I understand.

14
00:03:21,696 --> 00:03:25,700
You know of Flight 515, the plane crash?
You're wearing the ribbon.

15
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:28,520
Yes, sir.
I'm quite aware of Wayfarer 515.

16
00:03:28,645 --> 00:03:30,918
I was one of the first responders
on the scene that day.

17
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,584
Then what are you doing?

18
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:34,009
Citing you, sir.

19
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,052
You don't believe me?

20
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:40,302
Regardless of how
that windshield was damaged,

21
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,489
this car is unsafe to drive
in this condition.

22
00:03:42,614 --> 00:03:44,314
Stay in the car, please.

23
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,563
Wait just a minute.
Just one minute.

24
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,629
I asked you to stay in the vehicle.

25
00:03:52,754 --> 00:03:55,067
- I can get out of my own car.
- Sir, listen...

26
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,996
No. You listen to me.
It's time for you to listen to me.

27
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:00,078
Calm down and get back in that car.

28
00:04:00,203 --> 00:04:03,617
This is America. I have rights.
Do you understand that?

29
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:06,620
At least have the common decency
to hear me out.

30
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,445
- Step back right now.
- Did you even hear what I said?

31
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,293
Now you're giving me a ticket?
I told you

32
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,179
that my house
was in the debris field.

33
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:17,141
Do you have the remotest
inkling of what that means?

34
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:20,429
- Sir, calm down.
- Hellfire rained down on my house

35
00:04:20,554 --> 00:04:24,513
where my children sleep!
There were body parts in my yard!

36
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,474
- Sir, this is your last warning.
- You gotta be kidding me!

37
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:29,268
I'm gonna pepper spray you.

38
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,020
You're gonna pepper spray?
Perfect!

39
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:33,981
That is just perfect!
Pepper spray the man

40
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,817
who's expressing his opinion
under the First Amendment!

43
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:05,786
Lastly, a little something
from down El Paso way.

44
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,875
Border Patrol came across
multiple homicides

45
00:05:09,171 --> 00:05:11,121
just this side of the border.

46
00:05:11,673 --> 00:05:15,223
Truck turn out to be a chicken run
out of Juarez and Laredo.

47
00:05:15,897 --> 00:05:18,605
Border Patrol's been playing
hide-and-seek with these <i>polleros</i>

48
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,777
for two years.

49
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:22,150
But this time,
as soon as they made it across,

50
00:05:22,275 --> 00:05:23,430
someone hit them.

51
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:24,755
Hit them hard.

52
00:05:25,142 --> 00:05:27,388
We're talking a driver
and nine illegals.

53
00:05:27,513 --> 00:05:28,812
No sign of the shooters.

54
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:30,955
This truck was carrying
more than just people.

55
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,410
What are we looking at?
Weed, coke, or meth?

56
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:36,446
Doesn't look like
they were transporting narcotics.

57
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,514
Why did the Border Patrol
kick this to us?

58
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,389
They didn't. I pulled it.

59
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,690
You ask me,
this high-end cartel work.

60
00:05:42,815 --> 00:05:44,165
Los Zetas, maybe.

61
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:48,018
Question is,
why do we have Juarez-style action

62
00:05:48,143 --> 00:05:49,793
on our side of the DMZ?

63
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,434
They sending a message
or clearing a path?

64
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,989
Or was this about
stopping one particular border-hopper?

65
00:05:56,761 --> 00:05:59,733
Maybe one of those extra-crispies
knew something he shouldn't.

66
00:06:00,886 --> 00:06:02,496
Anyway, keep your eyes open.

67
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:05,221
All right. That's it.
Slow news day.

68
00:06:05,346 --> 00:06:07,135
Add one more to the countdown.

69
00:06:07,532 --> 00:06:08,982
What's that, Gomie?

70
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:11,495
We're waiting
on that famous blue meth of yours.

71
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,613
29 days since we saw it last.

72
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,250
It's still out there. Don't worry.

73
00:06:17,695 --> 00:06:19,595
Local PD. I gotta take this.

74
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,763
Gomie, go beat your <i>pinata</i>.

75
00:06:21,888 --> 00:06:24,688
Rest of you jokers...
too damn quiet in here.

76
00:06:25,103 --> 00:06:26,753
Go catch some bad guys.

77
00:06:29,294 --> 00:06:30,594
What's up, Paul?

78
00:07:25,485 --> 00:07:27,017
Hey, Dad.

79
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,966
- So you're fixing up the house?
- Doing a little work, yeah.

80
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,880
I'll bounce. It's cool.

81
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:42,218
You doing okay?

82
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:47,132
Yeah, I'm good.
I just happened to be driving by

83
00:07:48,255 --> 00:07:49,605
and saw the sign.

84
00:07:50,143 --> 00:07:52,846
So, you're selling the place.

85
00:07:54,035 --> 00:07:55,218
In this market.

86
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:56,793
Can you believe it?

87
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:01,024
I see you moved the garage.
That's bold.

88
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:03,768
Your mother's idea.
It's quite an operation.

89
00:08:03,893 --> 00:08:06,131
We did, all new stucco,
all the master suite,

90
00:08:06,256 --> 00:08:08,706
sandblasted,
fumigated the basement...

91
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,020
Right on.

92
00:08:16,516 --> 00:08:19,289
Fixing up the place
totally increases resale value.

93
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,907
I read that in...
I want to say, like,

94
00:08:22,032 --> 00:08:23,315
<i>Time magazine.</i>

95
00:08:25,242 --> 00:08:28,291
So, what'd you do
with the upstairs bathroom?

96
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,343
All redone. New tiles
in the bathrooms and kitchens,

97
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,011
granite countertops, new appliances...
all top of the line.

98
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,587
Damn.
That's great, Dad.

99
00:08:39,488 --> 00:08:41,185
Think... I can get a tour?

100
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,901
These guys are trying to finish up.

101
00:08:44,026 --> 00:08:45,960
Maybe we'd better
stay out of their way.

102
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,339
There are pictures on the Web site,
if you wanna take a look.

103
00:08:57,182 --> 00:08:58,832
You're looking healthy.

104
00:08:59,637 --> 00:09:02,137
I'll tell your mother.
She'll be happy.

105
00:09:05,452 --> 00:09:06,452
Thanks.

106
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,381
You know, I could come by

107
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:13,125
sometime for... dinner or something.

108
00:09:15,452 --> 00:09:16,452
Sometime.

109
00:09:22,843 --> 00:09:23,893
Later, Dad.

110
00:09:37,652 --> 00:09:38,902
<i>You know, look,</i>

111
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:41,630
<i>he's a high school
teacher over at Wynne.</i>

112
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:44,305
<i>Never been in trouble
a day of his life.</i>

113
00:09:44,487 --> 00:09:46,499
<i>Found out he's got lung cancer,</i>

114
00:09:46,624 --> 00:09:48,755
<i>and now his wife kicks
the poor bastard</i>

115
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,430
<i>out of his own house.</i>

116
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:54,218
<i>I mean, look, guys,
if anybody rates a little slack,</i>

117
00:09:54,947 --> 00:09:56,197
<i>here's the guy.</i>

118
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:09,325
You remember Officer Cavanaugh?

119
00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:19,717
Officer, I'm very sorry
that I lost my temper.

120
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:23,389
There's no excuse for my behavior.

121
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,440
It was disrespectful.

122
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:53,715
She's divorcing me.

123
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:00,022
I don't know
what to tell you, buddy.

124
00:11:01,386 --> 00:11:02,736
It is what it is.

125
00:11:06,135 --> 00:11:08,435
She doesn't want me to see the kids.

126
00:11:12,324 --> 00:11:13,524
She said that?

127
00:11:39,337 --> 00:11:41,437
You don't write? You don't call?

128
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:50,783
It's a disaster.

129
00:11:52,814 --> 00:11:54,755
It is not a disaster.

130
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,841
It's not a disaster, all right?

131
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:01,424
She's not going to the cops.
She's not gonna tell a living soul.

132
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:02,999
You wanna know why?

133
00:12:03,617 --> 00:12:04,617
One word:

134
00:12:05,326 --> 00:12:06,376
"blowback".

135
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,394
If she blabs,

136
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:11,071
it'll be a disaster...

137
00:12:11,196 --> 00:12:12,196
for her.

138
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,732
That DEA brother-in-law?

139
00:12:15,478 --> 00:12:16,478
Screwed.

140
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,229
You were right under his nose.

141
00:12:18,354 --> 00:12:20,533
He'll be lucky if they let
him bust glue-sniffers

142
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:22,058
at the hobby shop.

143
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,981
The kids...
Paging Dr. Phil.

144
00:12:25,106 --> 00:12:28,822
My daddy's a drug dealer,
and my mommy turned him in.

145
00:12:29,475 --> 00:12:31,075
And the house... gone.

146
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,159
The feds will come and RICO her
and the kids out on the street.

147
00:12:34,284 --> 00:12:36,129
Good luck arguing with them on that.

148
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,097
No. It's not gonna happen.

149
00:12:39,415 --> 00:12:40,665
She's bluffing,

150
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:42,877
and she knows it.

151
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:50,896
Her going to the police

152
00:12:51,344 --> 00:12:53,539
is not the point, Saul.

153
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:56,161
She's out of my life.
Do you understand?

154
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,913
I've lost my family,

155
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,440
everything that I care about.

156
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:05,348
Buddy,

157
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:08,286
it's bad.

158
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,660
It's a calamity,

159
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,777
but we live to fight another day.

160
00:13:14,491 --> 00:13:18,008
And after a decent interval of time,
well,

161
00:13:19,285 --> 00:13:21,758
there are other fish in the sea.

162
00:13:23,572 --> 00:13:25,720
You've been out of circulation
for a while.

163
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,938
I mean, you'll be just amazed
at what's out there.

164
00:13:29,256 --> 00:13:31,542
Thailand, the Czech Republic...

165
00:13:32,983 --> 00:13:34,642
Those women are so grateful

166
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:36,314
to even be here.

167
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:40,459
In the meantime,

168
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,228
idle hands
are the devil's playthings,

169
00:13:43,821 --> 00:13:47,463
so you should get back on the horse
and do what you do best.

170
00:13:47,877 --> 00:13:48,913
First step:

171
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:51,531
talk to our friend and get cooking.

172
00:13:59,386 --> 00:14:01,036
I can't be the bad guy.

173
00:14:06,891 --> 00:14:08,541
I can't be the bad guy.

174
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,808
You know, we'll...
We'll revisit.

175
00:14:24,991 --> 00:14:27,991
Promise me you won't hang yourself
in the closet.

176
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:05,089
Pop-pop, the ice-cream man!

177
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,520
Don't tell your mom.

178
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,499
- Yeah.
- <i>It's me.</i>

179
00:15:26,783 --> 00:15:28,633
<i>We may have a wife problem.</i>

180
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,630
<i>Look, I need eyes on it.</i>

181
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,590
You got an address?

182
00:15:54,994 --> 00:15:56,548
Dinner's gonna be late.

183
00:15:56,673 --> 00:15:59,923
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie
are bringing takeout. But...

184
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:04,796
if you're hungry,
I could rustle something up.

185
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:34,712
Pass the ketchup, will you?

186
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,590
I've had enough trans fat
for one lifetime.

187
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,043
A two-day drive from the nearest ocean,
and you're eating raw fish.

188
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:54,387
That's all I'm saying.

189
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,800
Been a while since that minnow
been swimming. Right, buddy?

190
00:17:04,094 --> 00:17:08,098
You know... Flynn, here,
is looking for a part-time job, so...

191
00:17:08,223 --> 00:17:09,569
I don't know. If you...

192
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:13,152
- know of anything, you might wanna...
- My name's Walter Junior.

193
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:16,587
Like... What, you...
You can't even say his name?

194
00:17:17,755 --> 00:17:20,747
If you've changed your mind
about being called Flynn,

195
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:22,957
all you need to do is just tell me

196
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,083
that you don't want
to be called Flynn.

197
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,483
Dad didn't even show
up till fourth period,

198
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:30,570
and his eyes were all red
like he'd been crying or something.

199
00:17:30,695 --> 00:17:31,695
But you...

200
00:17:32,429 --> 00:17:33,677
you don't even care.

201
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,120
And now,
he won't even drive me home.

202
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:38,927
He won't say why,

203
00:17:39,052 --> 00:17:41,802
but I know
it's because you told him not to.

204
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:43,776
- Honey, I...
- What?

205
00:17:44,893 --> 00:17:46,898
I don't know what your problem is.

206
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,925
You may not love him anymore,

207
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,081
but I do.

208
00:17:52,596 --> 00:17:54,446
I mean, why you gotta be...

209
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:57,646
Why you gotta be such a... a bitch?

210
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,670
You don't talk to your mom that way.

211
00:18:01,795 --> 00:18:04,234
It's... It's all right.

212
00:18:09,275 --> 00:18:11,989
Skyler, I know
that you must have your reasons

213
00:18:12,114 --> 00:18:14,158
for... all of this.

214
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:23,638
I know it's none of my business,
but...

215
00:18:26,462 --> 00:18:28,412
keeping Walt from the kids...

216
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:36,187
You're right, Hank.

217
00:18:38,296 --> 00:18:40,243
It's none of your business.

218
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:48,625
Oh, my God.

219
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,476
After all of that, please tell me
that you are still not curious.

220
00:18:52,601 --> 00:18:55,875
- There's nothing to be curious about.
- Please.

221
00:18:56,153 --> 00:18:58,444
The day I heard
there was a second cell phone, I knew.

222
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:00,673
Believe me.
I've seen it a hundred times.

223
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,726
So, what?
Stop dancing around it.

224
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,837
What is it exactly
that you have seen a hundred times?

225
00:19:07,962 --> 00:19:09,355
Please, enlighten me.

226
00:19:10,503 --> 00:19:12,203
Look, a guy like Walt...

227
00:19:12,328 --> 00:19:14,128
a nice guy, decent, smart?

228
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:17,864
Let's face it... underachiever,
dead-end life, okay?

229
00:19:18,165 --> 00:19:21,159
He gets cancer. Time's running out.
Midlife crisis.

230
00:19:21,422 --> 00:19:23,421
He acts up. Steps out.

231
00:19:24,481 --> 00:19:28,011
Then the wife... she catches him.
I mean, it's a story as old as time.

232
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:30,357
Look, do the math, Marie.

233
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:32,251
Only comes out one way.

234
00:19:33,268 --> 00:19:34,718
Knowing Walt, he...

235
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,384
felt so guilty,
he probably told her himself.

236
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:42,139
I don't know. I think...

237
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:45,475
if he cheated on her,
that she would've told me by now.

238
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,193
It just feels like...

239
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,333
something more.

240
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:03,952
24-7 coverage. Need you ask?
How much is this gonna run me?

241
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,122
Jesus. I'm in the wrong business.

242
00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:10,489
Yeah. I'll call you.

243
00:20:11,197 --> 00:20:12,502
Return of the prodigal.

244
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,296
- Welcome back. How you feeling?
- I'm good.

245
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,764
Of course you are.
The world's your oyster. Am I right?

246
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:21,459
Unencumbered young man with...

247
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,922
stacks of cash.

248
00:20:25,754 --> 00:20:28,767
I'm jealous.
Hand to God, I'm jealous.

249
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:32,198
Yeah, speaking of cash,

250
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,315
you know what's giving me
heartburn lately?

251
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,583
Your former partner. This guy...

252
00:20:37,064 --> 00:20:40,321
He works like a bastard, right?
Builds a business, single-handed.

253
00:20:40,962 --> 00:20:44,868
Finally, the big money shows up,
and what does he do? He walks out.

254
00:20:47,301 --> 00:20:48,651
Talent like that,

255
00:20:48,776 --> 00:20:51,040
and he just flushes
it down the crapper.

256
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,244
It's like Michelangelo won't paint.

257
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:56,929
Look, I know you're out of it
and all, but you...

258
00:20:57,637 --> 00:20:59,674
you wouldn't talk to him, would you?

259
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,759
Help him pull his head
out of his ass?

260
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,913
Scratch that.

261
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:07,765
He won't listen to me,
he's not gonna listen to you,

262
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:09,951
all due respect.

263
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:14,683
You want a job?

264
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,430
A job?

265
00:21:17,864 --> 00:21:19,319
Who's got a job for me?

266
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,487
I do.

267
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:48,653


268
00:24:52,127 --> 00:24:53,327
Thought I'd...

269
00:24:53,877 --> 00:24:57,422
- well, visit, if you don't mind.
- No, of course not. You don't...

270
00:24:57,547 --> 00:24:59,399
- You don't need the room, do you?
- No.

271
00:24:59,524 --> 00:25:02,277
I just needed some more space
to spread out.

272
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,572
Just wanted to say hello
to little Holly here. Hey, girl.

273
00:25:10,815 --> 00:25:13,201
She is a beauty. Look at her.

274
00:25:13,326 --> 00:25:16,628
Thanks for being so flexible
on me coming in.

275
00:25:18,327 --> 00:25:20,438
I just wish we had you back
full time.

276
00:25:20,563 --> 00:25:22,513
You do brighten up the place.

277
00:25:26,418 --> 00:25:28,874
Listen, believe me, this is...

278
00:25:29,977 --> 00:25:32,376
I don't wanna bring this up,
but I... I can't sign off

279
00:25:32,501 --> 00:25:34,699
sign off on these quarterlies.
I'm sorry.

280
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,017
I just can't.

281
00:25:39,844 --> 00:25:41,044
Is that right?

282
00:25:45,225 --> 00:25:48,675
If you're gonna do this,
you can't be so glaring about it.

283
00:25:51,014 --> 00:25:52,014
Glaring.

284
00:25:57,086 --> 00:25:58,586
That does sound bad.

285
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:00,975
Show me what's bothering you.

286
00:26:08,115 --> 00:26:09,115
Keller.

287
00:26:11,776 --> 00:26:12,776
Again...

288
00:26:13,086 --> 00:26:15,986
God, I'm sorry.
I know how you feel about this.

289
00:26:16,385 --> 00:26:18,035
Revenue with no backup.

290
00:26:19,721 --> 00:26:21,954
Here, here, and here.

291
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,998
I don't even know what to say.

292
00:26:36,212 --> 00:26:38,603
This is fixable, right?

293
00:26:38,728 --> 00:26:42,215
How about if I just push... 28,800,

294
00:26:44,157 --> 00:26:45,811
out of this into next quarter?

295
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,892
Would you sign it then?

296
00:26:53,376 --> 00:26:54,626
I'm just saying

297
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:58,773
I can't sign it
as it currently exists.

298
00:26:59,812 --> 00:27:00,912
Fair enough.

299
00:27:01,906 --> 00:27:03,456
I'll take care of it.

300
00:27:03,962 --> 00:27:05,790
Thank you for the heads-up.

301
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,224
You won't have to deal
with this again, I swear.

302
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:13,381
What if your kids found out?

303
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:18,561
If my kids found out?

304
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:21,514
This... what you're doing.

305
00:27:22,355 --> 00:27:24,100
Someday,
they're gonna be old enough.

306
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:26,017
How would you explain it to them?

307
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,249
Put me on the spot, why don't you?

308
00:27:35,293 --> 00:27:36,793
I guess maybe I'd...

309
00:27:38,268 --> 00:27:41,268
I'd say that...
I might have feet of clay that...

310
00:27:42,013 --> 00:27:44,287
But that whatever I did,
I did thinking of them.

311
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:46,721
You know? Trying to provide.

312
00:27:48,216 --> 00:27:49,516
And I'd ask them

313
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,526
to try to take the time
to understand...

314
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:56,908
You know what? Truth is,

315
00:27:57,835 --> 00:27:59,413
I haven't thought that far ahead.

316
00:27:59,538 --> 00:28:02,025
I'm just trying to keep
my head above water, so...

317
00:28:03,334 --> 00:28:05,034
I better get back to it.

318
00:28:18,595 --> 00:28:19,595
Hi, Walt.

319
00:28:20,187 --> 00:28:23,025
Listen. I can't talk.
I'm at work right now.

320
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,245
Louis dropped him off.
He was here when I got home.

321
00:28:28,817 --> 00:28:30,739
No. Of course.
No. He's not staying.

322
00:28:30,864 --> 00:28:32,364
He understands that.

323
00:28:32,774 --> 00:28:34,757
I'll bring him anywhere you want.

324
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:35,882
Dad...

325
00:28:38,449 --> 00:28:42,771
It is rush hour. I could fight traffic
and bring him down to Beneke now,

326
00:28:42,896 --> 00:28:45,296
but wouldn't it be easier if we...

327
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:49,988
Right. Okay. Good.
So we'll meet you at the house.

328
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:55,215
Why are you doing this?

329
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,140
She's just trying
to keep me from seeing you,

330
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:00,854
and you're helping her.

331
00:29:00,979 --> 00:29:02,991
No. No, son. I mean, your...

332
00:29:03,648 --> 00:29:06,406
your mother... she has her reasons.

333
00:29:07,465 --> 00:29:08,615
What reasons?

334
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:12,684
They're...

335
00:29:18,394 --> 00:29:20,244
Well, they're just a little

336
00:29:20,369 --> 00:29:22,190
difficult to delineate, but...

337
00:29:22,315 --> 00:29:23,415
I mean, yes,

338
00:29:24,668 --> 00:29:27,718
there are two sides to every story.
Always. But...

339
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:30,403
she...

340
00:29:36,556 --> 00:29:38,887
This is just how it has to be.

341
00:29:39,012 --> 00:29:40,012
For now.

342
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,959
And, look, your home is your home,

343
00:29:44,084 --> 00:29:46,334
and that is where you belong, okay?

344
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:50,463
But it's where you belong.
Dad, it's your house.

345
00:29:51,214 --> 00:29:52,964
Uncle Hank, Aunt Marie...

346
00:29:53,187 --> 00:29:56,287
everybody knows
that you haven't done anything wrong.

347
00:29:57,425 --> 00:30:00,042
Everybody is on your side.

348
00:30:06,707 --> 00:30:09,007
It's not about taking sides, though.

349
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:12,921
How can you let
her treat you like this?

350
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:14,422
Now, come on.

351
00:30:14,547 --> 00:30:17,898
- How can you just... just take it?
- Just listen to me, okay?

352
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,530
No matter what,

353
00:30:19,857 --> 00:30:22,752
all of this has nothing to do
with how we feel about you, okay?

354
00:30:22,877 --> 00:30:26,636
We both love you very,
very much, okay?

355
00:30:26,761 --> 00:30:29,682
You and your sister
will come first, always.

356
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:34,774
Now, come on.

357
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:41,637
Let's try to see this
in a positive light, okay?

358
00:30:41,762 --> 00:30:42,851
Both of us.

359
00:30:43,146 --> 00:30:45,202
Let's just buck up.

360
00:30:47,104 --> 00:30:48,804
Then I'll take you home.

361
00:30:53,374 --> 00:30:54,724
Let me first just

362
00:30:55,857 --> 00:30:57,657
hit the old bathroom here.

363
00:31:18,061 --> 00:31:21,259
Good afternoon. Nice to meet you.
Saul Goodman. Nice to meet you.

364
00:31:21,384 --> 00:31:24,715
You're not that lawyer
on late-night television, are you?

365
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,233
Better call Saul!

366
00:31:28,911 --> 00:31:30,262
I get it all the time.

367
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:34,934
We're here to discuss the sale
of the property at 9809 Margo.

368
00:31:35,619 --> 00:31:38,364
I get it. Flat-fee clients.
Am I right?

369
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:41,263
Well, folks, today's your lucky day.

370
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:45,089
I represent a client
who shall remain nameless.

371
00:31:45,675 --> 00:31:48,236
However, for our purposes,
you might just as well

372
00:31:48,361 --> 00:31:50,411
visualize a large bag of money.

373
00:31:50,863 --> 00:31:54,604
This individual wants to buy
your house today, for cash.

374
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,630
- Cash?
- Cash. I know. In this economy.

375
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,026
In fact, the money is already burning
a hole in my client's account.

376
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:04,462
You can ask Mr. Gardiner. I've shown him
all the pertinent financials.

377
00:32:04,587 --> 00:32:06,752
It's the only reason
we're sitting here.

378
00:32:07,849 --> 00:32:08,916
Fair enough.

379
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:11,720
We... get a few papers signed
and notarized,

380
00:32:11,845 --> 00:32:13,389
we can take care of this right now.

381
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:16,433
In fact, I can wire you your money
this very afternoon.

382
00:32:17,075 --> 00:32:20,229
There's just one
little hair in the soup...

383
00:32:20,924 --> 00:32:21,924
the price.

384
00:32:25,567 --> 00:32:28,142
We feel 875 is very fair.

385
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:32,311
But I suppose there's always a little...
wiggle room.

386
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,873
You wiggle us on down to 400

387
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:38,956
and you got yourselves a deal.

388
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,754
400,000? What is that, a joke?

389
00:32:43,176 --> 00:32:44,960
No, that's my offer.

390
00:32:45,411 --> 00:32:47,311
That's less than half price.

391
00:32:47,828 --> 00:32:49,937
We put almost that much
into the renovations alone.

392
00:32:50,062 --> 00:32:51,719
Why don't we just cut the clown act

393
00:32:52,294 --> 00:32:54,972
and you tell us
what you're willing to come up to?

394
00:32:55,356 --> 00:32:57,696
400,000. That's my final offer.

395
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,468
This is a waste of time.

396
00:32:59,593 --> 00:33:02,158
How could you possibly imagine
that we would entertain this?

397
00:33:02,556 --> 00:33:06,275
I thought some allowance was in order
once I heard about the meth lab...

398
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,920
that used to be in the basement.

399
00:33:09,045 --> 00:33:12,111
I looked over your signed
disclosure statements,

400
00:33:12,236 --> 00:33:14,782
and I don't see any mention
of a meth lab.

401
00:33:14,907 --> 00:33:17,007
You got your termite inspection.

402
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,954
That's good. But no

403
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:22,823
... meth lab.
Now, some would call that fraud

404
00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:25,349
in service of concealing a felony.

405
00:33:25,624 --> 00:33:27,756
I, myself, am more open-minded.

406
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,303
But it is tricky.

407
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:33,344
Don't get me wrong.
I applaud your <i>cojones</i>.

408
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:34,512
I mean,

409
00:33:34,896 --> 00:33:38,900
good try in sneaking a meth-contaminated
property past the buyer.

410
00:33:40,341 --> 00:33:42,519
Could've been a good deal for you.
Too bad.

411
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,636
Now, I could...

412
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:48,343
file a suit and encumber
this property indefinitely,

413
00:33:48,468 --> 00:33:50,811
or I could start
some criminal proceedings.

414
00:33:50,936 --> 00:33:53,936
But I don't think
any of us want that now, do we?

415
00:33:54,181 --> 00:33:55,881
How about it, counselor?

416
00:33:56,266 --> 00:33:57,466
Do you concur?

417
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:20,474
Here you go.

418
00:34:22,137 --> 00:34:24,677
Come on. It's not Devil's Island.

419
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,840
- Brought pizza.
- Well, I'm making dinner.

420
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:57,344
I'll just... put it in the fridge.

421
00:34:57,605 --> 00:34:59,605
It's even better the next day.

422
00:35:03,427 --> 00:35:04,351
Hi, honey.

423
00:35:08,543 --> 00:35:09,543
Sorry.

424
00:35:17,886 --> 00:35:19,116
Honey, what...

425
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:21,508
What kind of example
do we want to set here?

426
00:35:21,633 --> 00:35:24,177
Right? I mean,
can't we at least just sit down

427
00:35:24,302 --> 00:35:26,081
and eat a piece of pizza together?

428
00:35:26,475 --> 00:35:28,948
Just to hash things out like adults?

429
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:31,797
We have...

430
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,120
discussed everything
we need to discuss.

431
00:35:35,245 --> 00:35:37,495
I thought I made myself very clear.

432
00:35:41,786 --> 00:35:43,336
I got dipping sticks.

433
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:30,979


434
00:37:05,562 --> 00:37:08,549
<i>You've reached Walt's temporary number.
Please leave a message. </i>

435
00:37:13,226 --> 00:37:15,722
<i>When I went out this morning
to get the newspaper,</i>

436
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:18,933
<i>I saw a pizza on our roof.</i>

437
00:37:19,058 --> 00:37:21,308
<i>Would you know anything about that?</i>

438
00:37:21,858 --> 00:37:25,001
<i>Listen to me, Walt.
You need to control yourself.</i>

439
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:27,640
<i>Calm down, accept the situation,</i>

440
00:37:27,765 --> 00:37:29,666
<i>and keep your distance.</i>

441
00:37:30,098 --> 00:37:31,696
<i>If you can't manage that,</i>

442
00:37:31,821 --> 00:37:34,229
<i>I will get a restraining order.</i>

443
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,205
I got your restraining order
right here!

444
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,530
Restrain this!

445
00:38:05,421 --> 00:38:07,229
Breaking even's not so bad.

446
00:38:07,354 --> 00:38:10,439
In this economy, a lot of people
would kill to break even.

447
00:38:10,564 --> 00:38:13,008
Poor Jake. He had his heart set

448
00:38:13,382 --> 00:38:15,128
on going to space camp.

449
00:38:20,137 --> 00:38:22,488
Oh, God, this is all we need.

450
00:38:24,682 --> 00:38:26,105
Hey, Mom, Dad.

451
00:38:27,048 --> 00:38:28,298
How's it going?

452
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,585
It's really not a good time.

453
00:38:35,058 --> 00:38:37,864
Jesse, the house has been sold.

454
00:38:38,158 --> 00:38:40,160
The new owners
are expected at any moment.

455
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:42,694
- Where do you think you're going?
- Inside.

456
00:38:44,726 --> 00:38:46,176
I bought the place.

457
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:01,808
Be back by 7, okay?

458
00:39:03,165 --> 00:39:04,215
I love you.

459
00:39:10,376 --> 00:39:11,376
Bye.

460
00:44:19,779 --> 00:44:22,450
It's me. There's something
you should know about.

461
00:44:24,515 --> 00:44:25,515
Hold on.
