<i>Previously on</i> Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:06,631
I can't help you get through this
if you wont me what it is Walt did.

3
00:00:07,194 --> 00:00:09,842
- <i>Two men are coming to kill you.</i>
- Come again.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,719
Two men ambushed Hank.

5
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,722
Their tattoos indicate
an affiliation with the drug cartel.

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,183
You knew my brother-in-law
was with the DEA.

7
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,435
I investigate everyone
with whom I do business.

8
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:23,569
I am sleeping with my boss
and I don't know why.

9
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:27,143
This is the bomb.
What's up partner?

10
00:00:27,677 --> 00:00:28,944
This is my replacement?

11
00:00:30,784 --> 00:00:33,080
<i>In the litlle village
where I was born,</i>

12
00:00:33,205 --> 00:00:35,898
<i>life moved at a slower pace...</i>

13
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:39,124
<i>yet felt all the richer for it.</i>

14
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:43,472
<i>There, my two uncles were known
far and wide</i>

15
00:00:43,597 --> 00:00:46,134
<i>for their delicious cooking.</i>

16
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:48,437
<i>They seasoned their zesty chicken</i>

17
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:52,101
<i>using only the freshest herbs
and spices.</i>

18
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:55,563
<i>People called them
"Los Pollos Hermanos",</i>

19
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:57,386
<i>the Chicken Brothers.</i>

20
00:00:57,511 --> 00:01:00,266
<i>Today, we carry on their tradition</i>

21
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:03,359
<i>in a manner that would make
my uncles proud.</i>

22
00:01:03,484 --> 00:01:07,503
<i>The finest ingredients
are brought together with loving care...</i>

23
00:01:07,628 --> 00:01:10,733
<i>then slow-cooked to perfection.</i>

24
00:01:11,022 --> 00:01:14,370
<i>Yes, the old ways are still best</i>

25
00:01:14,495 --> 00:01:16,539
<i>at Los Pollos Hermanos.</i>

26
00:01:16,664 --> 00:01:18,297

27
00:01:18,422 --> 00:01:20,930

201.6.

31
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,630
Jesus, seriously.

32
00:03:17,082 --> 00:03:18,539
Better over than under.

33
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,563
Over by a pound and a half.

34
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:24,138
I thought you were all,
like, precise.

35
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:26,835
Whatever. We'll just save
it out till next week.

36
00:03:27,648 --> 00:03:29,250
No. We ship it as-is.

37
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,774
What are we, running a charity?

38
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:34,017
Come on, man,
we're gonna take it out.

39
00:03:34,434 --> 00:03:35,411
Leave it.

40
00:03:35,536 --> 00:03:36,799
One batch, one ship.

41
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,717
Stop complicating things.

42
00:03:45,546 --> 00:03:48,126
Why are you purposely
giving him free meth?

43
00:03:49,156 --> 00:03:51,612
These bitches are bleeding
us enough already.

44
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:55,130
You are paid extraordinarily well.

45
00:03:55,255 --> 00:03:57,266
Why can't you just appreciate that?

46
00:03:57,391 --> 00:03:59,480
I been crunching numbers, all right?

47
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:01,965
- You've been crunching numbers?
- I've been crunching numbers,

48
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,078
and I don't gotta be a
mathematician to figure out

49
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,667
that this deal you made is bullshit.

50
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:08,985
- We both earn...
- I know...

51
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:11,494
a million and a half each.

52
00:04:12,014 --> 00:04:13,230
Whoop-de-doo.

53
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:14,983
What's he getting?

54
00:04:17,962 --> 00:04:19,121
Say he's wholesaling

55
00:04:19,396 --> 00:04:21,123
at 40 large a pound.

56
00:04:21,248 --> 00:04:22,514
That's probably high.

57
00:04:22,883 --> 00:04:24,771
High. What, for our stuff?

58
00:04:25,252 --> 00:04:26,503
That's what I was getting.

59
00:04:26,628 --> 00:04:28,797
Look, say he's getting 40 a pound.

60
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:32,101
All right? 200 pounds a
week for three months.

61
00:04:32,526 --> 00:04:34,648
And, like, what happens at
the end of the three months?

62
00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:36,405
Look, what... whatever.

63
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,507
200 pounds a week for three months.

64
00:04:38,632 --> 00:04:40,446
That's 2400 pounds.

65
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,813
2400 times 40,000 is...

66
00:04:42,938 --> 00:04:45,781
and I swear to God, I double-checked
this, like, 10 times...

67
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:47,356
96 million dollars.

68
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:51,503
96 million dollars.

69
00:04:52,145 --> 00:04:54,648
All right? 96 million.

70
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:57,664
96 to our three.

71
00:04:58,318 --> 00:05:00,064
That is messed up, yo.

72
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:01,847
That is so messed up.

73
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:03,594
Fairness-wise, I can't even...

74
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,863
You are now a millionaire,

75
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:10,226
and you're complaining?

76
00:05:11,646 --> 00:05:13,446
What world do you live in?

77
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:17,079
One where the dudes who are
actually doing all the work

78
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,747
ain't getting fisted.

79
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,197
What is going on with you lately?

80
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:22,972
What's happened to you?

81
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,408
Hang on, can't we just...

82
00:05:26,713 --> 00:05:28,455
We got to hash this out.

83
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,022
What's more important than money?

84
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:38,967
These things they
laughingly call pillows,

85
00:05:39,532 --> 00:05:41,970
I would not give them
to prison inmates.

86
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,525
You want me to go ask for another?

87
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,345
Just remind me to
bring his from home.

88
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,020
They're not moving his legs enough.

89
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,519
Everybody.

90
00:05:56,576 --> 00:05:57,519
Hi, Marie.

91
00:05:57,644 --> 00:05:58,894
Is it okay if...

92
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:01,429
if I visit?

93
00:06:17,818 --> 00:06:19,368
His color looks good.

94
00:06:23,136 --> 00:06:25,428
Gomie, is that you?

95
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,349
Buddy. It's me.

96
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:29,658
That's you, Gomie?

97
00:06:30,726 --> 00:06:32,761
Yeah, Hank. I'm right here.

98
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:36,115
Come here. Closer.

99
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,757
What is it?

100
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:40,419
Closer.

101
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:46,447
Asshole.

102
00:06:49,447 --> 00:06:51,079
Man, he got you good.

103
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:56,153
I'm glad to see you still have
your twisted sense of humor.

104
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:06,479
Check this out.

105
00:07:07,305 --> 00:07:09,518
I got something that'll
make you feel better.

106
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:11,994
I've been keeping an eye
on that blue meth of yours.

107
00:07:12,452 --> 00:07:13,932
Six, seven weeks, nothing.

108
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:17,199
Then all of a sudden, boom.
It's popping up everywhere.

109
00:07:17,681 --> 00:07:19,605
Look at the new locations.
Texas,

110
00:07:20,443 --> 00:07:21,494
Nevada,

111
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:23,071
up in Farmington.

112
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,673
Even right here in town.

113
00:07:25,123 --> 00:07:28,310
A teener here and there,
strictly street-level amounts.

114
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:30,178
Man, it's crazy.

115
00:07:31,395 --> 00:07:33,903
How exactly is that supposed
to make me feel better?

116
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:36,890
Because you were right.

117
00:07:37,015 --> 00:07:38,998
You're the only one
that saw this coming.

118
00:07:39,123 --> 00:07:40,459
Three cheers for me.

119
00:07:43,778 --> 00:07:46,261
This thing doesn't
do a damned thing.

120
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:49,264
Hank, it's probably
still on lock-out.

121
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:50,677
It's been an hour, right?

122
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:53,599
I'm hurting here.
I could use some meds.

123
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:57,026
Okay. I'll go find somebody.

124
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:01,230
No more shop talk.

125
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,355
Sorry.

126
00:08:07,193 --> 00:08:08,843
I didn't see it coming.

127
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:10,385
What?

128
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,960
Damn right you did.

129
00:08:12,955 --> 00:08:14,555
No, I didn't see shit.

130
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:18,421
Day late and a dollar short,
as usual.

131
00:08:21,421 --> 00:08:23,021
The only reason I'm...

132
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:25,278
even breathing...

133
00:08:27,864 --> 00:08:29,564
is I got a warning call.

134
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:34,242
A warning call? What do you mean?

135
00:08:34,522 --> 00:08:36,122
One minute before they

136
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,230
attacked me,

137
00:08:39,188 --> 00:08:40,477
somebody called my cell

138
00:08:41,947 --> 00:08:43,251
and told me to expect it.

139
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:45,876
A voice scrambler.
It could have been anybody.

140
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,924
Marie's got my phone somewhere,

141
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:50,751
if you want to run the incoming.

142
00:08:52,608 --> 00:08:54,700
Not that you're going to
learn anything worth knowing.

143
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:58,271
I don't get it. Cartel hit?

144
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,450
Who would have called to warn you?

145
00:09:00,575 --> 00:09:02,637
I don't know.

146
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:04,971
Jesus.

147
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:06,992
Come on already.

148
00:09:50,128 --> 00:09:53,300
Skyler, I had nothing to do...

149
00:09:58,504 --> 00:09:59,604
Are we safe?

150
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:03,735
Yes.

151
00:10:14,635 --> 00:10:15,785
Are you safe?

152
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:21,887
Absolutely.

153
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:55,529
What about you?

154
00:10:56,502 --> 00:10:57,902
Face looks better.

155
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:01,952
How's it all going?
Anything you want to tell us about?

156
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:06,229
What, like my interesting life?

157
00:11:07,988 --> 00:11:10,216
One day pretty much
bleeds into the next.

158
00:11:12,615 --> 00:11:13,672
Been working a lot.

159
00:11:14,755 --> 00:11:15,889
I got a job.

160
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,372
Job is good.

161
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:20,042
It's in a Laundromat.

162
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:22,288
- It's totally corporate.
- Corporate Laundromat.

163
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,017
It's, like, rigid.
All kinds of red tape.

164
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,776
My boss is a dick.
The owner? Super dick.

165
00:11:29,194 --> 00:11:32,494
I'm not worthy or whatever to meet him,
but I guess everybody's scared of him.

166
00:11:32,946 --> 00:11:34,960
The place is full of
dead-eyed douche-bags,

167
00:11:35,282 --> 00:11:36,358
the hours suck,

168
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:38,227
and nobody knows what's going on,

169
00:11:38,352 --> 00:11:39,352
so...

170
00:11:40,044 --> 00:11:41,748
Sounds kind of Kafkaesque.

171
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:48,076
Totally Kafkaesque.

172
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:53,299
Majorly.

173
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,210
From the U.S. attorney in Santa Fe.

174
00:11:58,638 --> 00:12:00,469
Very nice.

175
00:12:00,774 --> 00:12:03,824
We've got all these nice
tulips and baby's breath.

176
00:12:05,163 --> 00:12:08,129
This is chrysanthemum.
That looks like chrysanthemum.

177
00:12:08,315 --> 00:12:10,192
Look at these Hank.
Aren't they beautiful?

178
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,362
- Beautiful.
- Look at the size of this basket.

179
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:15,864
It's got so many goodies in it.

180
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:17,532
Look, chocolate-covered pretzels

181
00:12:17,657 --> 00:12:19,635
and cheese sticks

182
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,290
and some some fancy designer olives.

183
00:12:22,415 --> 00:12:23,963
You had me at cheese sticks.

184
00:12:24,088 --> 00:12:26,066
You're going to have
to fight me for those, Hank.

185
00:12:26,191 --> 00:12:28,810
"Get well, and best
wishes from Ted Beneke

186
00:12:28,935 --> 00:12:31,249
and all the folks at
Beneke Fabricators."

187
00:12:31,772 --> 00:12:34,072
He gives you all this time off,

188
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,318
and now this?
Get me a job there.

189
00:12:36,443 --> 00:12:37,819
I know. He's great.

190
00:12:37,944 --> 00:12:38,965
Boss hall of fame.

191
00:12:39,246 --> 00:12:41,103
I don't see anything
here from Kleinman.

192
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:44,098
They're going to have
to get on the stick.

193
00:12:45,285 --> 00:12:46,828
How's everybody doing today?

194
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:47,974
Good. We're good.

195
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,331
How are you?

196
00:12:49,456 --> 00:12:50,686
I'm very good.

197
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,170
Just going to do a quick
peripheral response, all right?

198
00:12:55,295 --> 00:12:57,645
See where we're at.
Moment of truth?

199
00:12:58,632 --> 00:13:00,195
Yeah. I wouldn't call it that.

200
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,716
All right, let's just
take a look here.

201
00:13:04,638 --> 00:13:05,638
All right.

202
00:13:07,974 --> 00:13:10,163
All right, I want you to
tell me if you can feel this.

203
00:13:15,315 --> 00:13:16,337
All right.

204
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:18,846
How about this?

205
00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:22,927
Okay.

206
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:26,036
How about now?

207
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,160
Do that one again, would you?

208
00:13:30,996 --> 00:13:32,310
Right there?

209
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:36,286
Yeah, yeah, I feel it. A tingle.

210
00:13:36,603 --> 00:13:38,113
Okay, on a scale of one to ten,

211
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:41,194
ten being your normal level of feeling
and one being no feeling at all.

212
00:13:41,475 --> 00:13:42,614
I don't know.

213
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:45,487
A four?

214
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,695
Four. Okay.

215
00:13:47,898 --> 00:13:49,398
And how about...

216
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,560
there?

217
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:55,441
A six.

218
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:56,761
Okay, good.

219
00:13:56,886 --> 00:13:57,886
And...

220
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:00,512
here?

221
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,562
Yeah, still there. A little less.

222
00:14:05,632 --> 00:14:06,761
A three. Okay.

223
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:08,492
All right, good.

224
00:14:09,469 --> 00:14:11,813
Thank you very much, Hank.
Good, good.

225
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:14,558
So this is good news, right?

226
00:14:15,716 --> 00:14:16,980
Definitely.

227
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:20,436
It looks like some

228
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:22,235
nerve function is returning.

229
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:24,043
Oh, thank God.

230
00:14:24,618 --> 00:14:27,518
All right, so when do we
get him walking again?

231
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,771
It's important that
we manage our expectations.

232
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,561
We're talking about
months of very hard work,

233
00:14:41,686 --> 00:14:44,716
and even then the odds,
they're not great.

234
00:14:45,005 --> 00:14:46,818
But you can't know for sure.

235
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,846
When does he start physical therapy?

236
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,380
We've sent the paperwork
to your insurance.

237
00:14:52,505 --> 00:14:53,789
It's high priority.

238
00:14:53,914 --> 00:14:56,312
We should have pre-authorization
the next few days.

239
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,023
Certainly by early next week.

240
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,264
Next week?

241
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:02,400
No, that's not going to do it.

242
00:15:02,656 --> 00:15:04,819
I've looked into this.

243
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,701
The sooner physical therapy begins,

244
00:15:06,826 --> 00:15:08,470
the better his chances are.

245
00:15:08,595 --> 00:15:10,187
He needs daily sessions.

246
00:15:10,312 --> 00:15:11,493
Isn't that right?

247
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:12,778
Actually,

248
00:15:12,903 --> 00:15:15,767
your plan's treatment program
covers four sessions a week.

249
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,165
Actually,

250
00:15:18,008 --> 00:15:19,558
she asked the doctor.

251
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:24,966
Plan-wise, four sessions
a week is fairly typical.

252
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,410
And the therapists in your
network are mostly fine.

253
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,888
Mostly fine? Okay.
There's a ringing endorsement.

254
00:15:34,304 --> 00:15:37,195
Look, if Hank had
more physical therapy,

255
00:15:37,422 --> 00:15:39,072
with better therapists,

256
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:42,691
wouldn't it be more
likely he would walk?

257
00:15:44,731 --> 00:15:46,681
It's very hard to say, Marie.

258
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:51,741
Is the health plan's way
medically justifiable? Sure.

259
00:15:52,572 --> 00:15:54,323
Is it absolutely optimal?

260
00:15:55,057 --> 00:15:56,807
You know, screw it.

261
00:15:58,577 --> 00:16:01,501
I'll make sure he gets what he needs,
and they can reimburse me later.

262
00:16:01,805 --> 00:16:04,658
Mrs. Schrader, I get your
frustration. Really, I do.

263
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,996
But my best advice is
stay in the network.

264
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:09,301
Don't go out of pocket.

265
00:16:09,522 --> 00:16:11,494
Physical therapy is
just the beginning.

266
00:16:11,757 --> 00:16:13,962
We're talking nursing care,

267
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:15,470
modifications to your home,

268
00:16:15,595 --> 00:16:18,139
occupational therapy,
medical equipment.

269
00:16:18,264 --> 00:16:20,578
It could run into the hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

270
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:22,761
So what?

271
00:16:23,603 --> 00:16:25,734
We're just supposed to
compromise on his care?

272
00:16:26,048 --> 00:16:29,417
Well, if you don't follow the
insurance company's procedures,

273
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:30,947
they may never pay you back.

274
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,088
I've seen patients and
their families go bankrupt,

275
00:16:33,213 --> 00:16:34,963
waiting to be reimbursed.

276
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,622
Who is the best physical
therapist that you know?

277
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,096
I can give you some names.

278
00:16:41,221 --> 00:16:43,431
But they're not likely
to be on your plan.

279
00:16:43,556 --> 00:16:44,753
To hell with the plan.

280
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:05,287
There he is.

281
00:17:05,412 --> 00:17:07,776
Finally. I went ahead
and started without you.

282
00:17:08,238 --> 00:17:10,987
Ladies, this is Jesse-san.
He's in for the full treatment.

283
00:17:11,217 --> 00:17:13,145
Kick off your shoes.
Lay back.

284
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,254
Exfoliate.

285
00:17:14,676 --> 00:17:15,742
Maybe later.

286
00:17:15,955 --> 00:17:18,142
So, where's the maestro?
Out parking the mini-van?

287
00:17:18,267 --> 00:17:20,665
What do I look like, his shadow?
Who cares where he's at?

288
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,340
What am I doing here?

289
00:17:23,405 --> 00:17:25,473
I was going to
have you two flip a coin,

290
00:17:26,816 --> 00:17:29,047
but since the genius
can't be bothered,

291
00:17:29,906 --> 00:17:31,167
today's your lucky day.

292
00:17:31,362 --> 00:17:33,426
Look around, kiddo. It's all yours.

293
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,940
What?

294
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,041
This?

295
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:41,307
Yeah. You are now the owner
of this fine establishment.

296
00:17:42,486 --> 00:17:43,394
For free?

297
00:17:43,626 --> 00:17:45,277
Free? Ladies, cover your ears.

298
00:17:46,476 --> 00:17:47,567
Not free.

299
00:17:48,822 --> 00:17:50,922
Look, hey, this is a squeaky-clean,

300
00:17:51,047 --> 00:17:53,474
highly profitable,
at least potentially...

301
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:57,105
local institution, looked upon with
favor by the Chamber of Commerce.

302
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,618
Better Business Bureau.

303
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,200
At $312,000, it's a steal.

304
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,022
312,000?

305
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:05,726
Don't you get it?

306
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,877
On the outside,
it's a nail salon, right?

307
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,304
On the inside,

308
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:12,268
it's the best money
laundry a growing boy could ask for.

309
00:18:15,424 --> 00:18:16,094
Wait.

310
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,262
Wait.

311
00:18:17,602 --> 00:18:18,673
Ladies, thank you.

312
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:21,015
Thank you. Good job.
Come back here.

313
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,623
Sit. Come on.

314
00:18:25,258 --> 00:18:27,108
Humor me here for a second.

315
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:30,826
Now, you know you need to
launder your money, right?

316
00:18:31,865 --> 00:18:35,238
Do you understand the basics of it?
Placement, layering, integration?

317
00:18:35,468 --> 00:18:38,413
I ain't buying no damn nail salon,
so just forget it.

318
00:18:38,538 --> 00:18:40,243
You want to stay out of jail,
don't you?

319
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,777
You want to keep your
money and your freedom.

320
00:18:43,032 --> 00:18:45,881
Because I got three little
letters for you. IRS.

321
00:18:46,006 --> 00:18:48,293
If they can get Capone,
they can get you.

322
00:18:50,267 --> 00:18:52,550
Here's you, right?
Pink, Pinkman. Get it?

323
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,450
Here's your cash.
You're out on the town.

324
00:18:56,847 --> 00:19:00,223
You're partying hearty. You're
knocking boots with the chickie babes.

325
00:19:00,449 --> 00:19:01,871
Who's this?

326
00:19:01,996 --> 00:19:03,057
It's the tax man.

327
00:19:03,524 --> 00:19:04,846
And he's looking at you.

328
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:06,321
What does he see?

329
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:08,942
He sees a young fellow with a big,
fancy house,

330
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:11,936
unlimited cash supply, and no job.

331
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,881
Now what is the conclusion
the tax man makes?

332
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:17,362
I'm a drug dealer.

333
00:19:17,678 --> 00:19:18,573
Wrong.

334
00:19:18,778 --> 00:19:20,218
Million times worse.

335
00:19:20,489 --> 00:19:22,021
You're a tax cheat.

336
00:19:22,457 --> 00:19:24,747
What do they do?
They take every penny,

337
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,041
and you go in the can
for felony tax evasion.

338
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:30,457
Ouch. What was your mistake?

339
00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:33,057
You didn't launder your money.

340
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,677
Now, you give me your money.
That's called placement.

341
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,698
Hand me that little thinGod bin.

342
00:19:41,757 --> 00:19:43,431
This is the nail salon, right?

343
00:19:43,803 --> 00:19:45,413
I take your dirty money

344
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:49,503
and I slip it into the salon's nice,
clean cash flow.

345
00:19:49,943 --> 00:19:51,466
That's called layering.

346
00:19:51,954 --> 00:19:53,191
Final step, integration.

347
00:19:53,844 --> 00:19:56,569
The revenues from the
salon go to the owner.

348
00:19:56,783 --> 00:20:00,428
That's you. Your filthy drug
money has been transformed

349
00:20:00,553 --> 00:20:03,178
into nice, clean, taxable income,

350
00:20:03,556 --> 00:20:07,223
brought to you by a savvy
investment in a thriving business.

351
00:20:09,229 --> 00:20:12,529
So you want me to buy this
place so I can pay taxes.

352
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:14,629
I'm a criminal.

353
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,817
And if you want to stay a criminal

354
00:20:17,942 --> 00:20:20,343
and not become, say, a convict,

355
00:20:20,573 --> 00:20:23,071
then maybe you should grow
up and listen to your lawyer.

356
00:20:23,196 --> 00:20:26,478
Right, so you can get your 5%.

357
00:20:26,603 --> 00:20:28,328
No, that's 17%.

358
00:20:28,915 --> 00:20:30,315
I heard you say 5.

359
00:20:30,795 --> 00:20:32,327
You said it right in front of me.

360
00:20:32,452 --> 00:20:35,525
That was for your partner.
It's privileges of seniority and all.

361
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:39,160
But for you, it's the usual.
17%, and that's a bargain.

362
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:41,322
Hey, what, you... Hey, listen to...

363
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:44,472
Come on, I'm talking to you
about your future here.

364
00:20:44,597 --> 00:20:46,494
Listen to reason.

365
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,621
How is your brother-in-law?

366
00:21:32,078 --> 00:21:33,128
He'll live.

367
00:21:34,914 --> 00:21:35,658
Good.

368
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:37,549
I'm glad.

369
00:21:40,787 --> 00:21:42,477
Walter, you seem troubled.

370
00:21:43,856 --> 00:21:45,306
How can I help you?

371
00:21:48,428 --> 00:21:50,433
I asked to see you in order to...

372
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:53,598
clear the air.

373
00:21:55,768 --> 00:21:58,092
There are some

374
00:21:58,217 --> 00:21:58,938
issues

375
00:21:59,906 --> 00:22:03,084
that could cause a misunderstanding
between us,

376
00:22:03,209 --> 00:22:05,033
and I think it's in our

377
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,441
best interest

378
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,382
to lay the cards on the table.

379
00:22:12,352 --> 00:22:14,052
That's the best way to do business.

380
00:22:17,557 --> 00:22:18,856
My brother-in-law,

381
00:22:19,258 --> 00:22:21,358
moments before he was attacked...

382
00:22:21,594 --> 00:22:23,444
someone called to warn him.

383
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:28,791
I believe that same
person was protecting me.

384
00:22:30,937 --> 00:22:32,137
Those two men,

385
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,090
the assassins...

386
00:22:35,274 --> 00:22:37,321
I believe I was their prime target,

387
00:22:38,664 --> 00:22:41,375
but that somehow they
were steered away from me

388
00:22:42,015 --> 00:22:43,565
to my brother-in-law.

389
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:50,297
Because of this intervention,

390
00:22:52,058 --> 00:22:53,108
I am alive.

391
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,460
And yet

392
00:22:56,497 --> 00:22:58,177
I think that this person

393
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,929
was playing a much deeper game.

394
00:23:05,138 --> 00:23:07,973
He made that phone call
because he wanted a shootout,

395
00:23:08,863 --> 00:23:10,788
not a silent assassination.

396
00:23:12,122 --> 00:23:13,322
In one stroke,

397
00:23:14,251 --> 00:23:15,901
he bloodied both sides,

398
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:20,295
set the American
and Mexican governments

399
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,870
against the cartel,

400
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:26,071
and cut off the supply
of methamphetamine to the Southwest.

401
00:23:28,982 --> 00:23:32,834
If this man
had his own source of product

402
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:35,246
on this side of the border...

403
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:39,977
he would have the market to himself.

404
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,498
The rewards would be...

405
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,079
enormous.

406
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,351
We're both adults.

407
00:23:58,357 --> 00:24:00,962
I can't pretend I don't
know that person is you.

408
00:24:05,605 --> 00:24:08,693
I want there to be no confusion.

409
00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:13,039
I know I owe you my life.

410
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,380
And more than that,

411
00:24:22,106 --> 00:24:23,892
I respect the strategy.

412
00:24:26,782 --> 00:24:28,132
In your position,

413
00:24:30,013 --> 00:24:31,763
I would've done the same.

414
00:24:39,067 --> 00:24:40,067
One issue

415
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,917
which troubles me...

416
00:24:46,181 --> 00:24:47,931
I don't know what happens

417
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:50,609
when our three-month contract ends.

418
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:54,778
What would you like to happen?

419
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:58,317
You know why I do this.

420
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,316
I want security for my family.

421
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:04,669
Then you have it.

422
00:25:05,226 --> 00:25:06,780
Three million for three months.

423
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,358
That was our agreement.

424
00:25:08,815 --> 00:25:10,215
Extended annually,

425
00:25:10,756 --> 00:25:12,356
twelve million a year.

426
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,810
Call it fifteen.

427
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,750
Open-ended.

428
00:25:18,791 --> 00:25:20,601
Would that be agreeable?

429
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:06,698
Part of the reason we talk about
what gets us riled up,

430
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,337
in our daily lives

431
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:12,466
is to help each other put a finger
on what our relapse triggers might be,

432
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,570
head off our disease
before it comes back.

433
00:27:19,913 --> 00:27:20,913
Anyone?

434
00:27:23,205 --> 00:27:26,320
Free license to bitch and moan.
How often do you get that?

435
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:32,566
Jesse, last time you seemed pretty down
about your job at the Laundromat.

436
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:36,738
Let me ask you something. If you had
the chance to do anything you wanted,

437
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,490
what would you do?

438
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:41,390
Make more green, man, a lot more.

439
00:27:41,847 --> 00:27:44,847
Forget about money.
Assume you have all you want.

440
00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:51,532
I don't know.

441
00:27:52,827 --> 00:27:56,502
I guess I would make something.

442
00:27:57,639 --> 00:27:58,639
Like what?

443
00:28:02,175 --> 00:28:04,275
Not that it even matters, but...

444
00:28:06,247 --> 00:28:08,703
work with my hands, I guess.

445
00:28:09,129 --> 00:28:10,829
Building things, like...

446
00:28:11,797 --> 00:28:14,428
carpentry or brick laying
or something?

447
00:28:15,014 --> 00:28:18,734
I took this vo-tech class
in high school,

448
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:20,590
wood working.

449
00:28:20,715 --> 00:28:23,993
I took a lot of vo-tech classes
because it was just a big jerk-off,

450
00:28:25,613 --> 00:28:28,207
but this one time I had this teacher

451
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:29,532
name of...

452
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:33,443
Mr. Pike.

453
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:39,462
I guess he was, like, a Marine
or something before he got old.

454
00:28:39,587 --> 00:28:40,760
He was hard of hearing.

455
00:28:41,413 --> 00:28:43,707
My project

456
00:28:43,832 --> 00:28:46,950
for his class was to make this

457
00:28:48,021 --> 00:28:49,490
wooden box,

458
00:28:49,615 --> 00:28:52,932
you know, like a small...

459
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:55,947
just like a... like a box,

460
00:28:56,072 --> 00:28:57,872
you know, to put stuff in.

461
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,856
So I wanted to get the thing done
just as fast as possible.

462
00:29:02,478 --> 00:29:05,499
I figured I could cut classes
for the rest of the semester,

463
00:29:05,624 --> 00:29:07,602
and he couldn't flunk me
as long as I,

464
00:29:07,727 --> 00:29:10,529
you know, made the thing.

465
00:29:11,414 --> 00:29:13,614
So I finished it in a couple days.

466
00:29:14,538 --> 00:29:18,788
It looked pretty lame,
but it worked,

467
00:29:18,913 --> 00:29:21,563
you know,
for putting stuff in or whatnot.

468
00:29:22,926 --> 00:29:26,373
So when I showed it to Mr. Pike

469
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:28,929
for my grade,

470
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:33,694
he looked at it and said,

471
00:29:35,129 --> 00:29:37,780
"Is that the best you can do?"

472
00:29:39,063 --> 00:29:41,199
At first I thought to myself,
"Hell, yeah, bitch.

473
00:29:41,324 --> 00:29:43,467
"Now give me a D and shut up

474
00:29:43,592 --> 00:29:46,327
"so I can go blaze one
with my boys."

475
00:29:51,097 --> 00:29:52,247
I don't know.

476
00:29:52,533 --> 00:29:55,033
Maybe it was the way
he said it, but...

477
00:29:56,454 --> 00:29:58,711
it was, like...
He wasn't exactly saying it sucked.

478
00:29:58,836 --> 00:30:00,886
He was just asking me honestly,

479
00:30:02,204 --> 00:30:03,804
"Is that all you got?"

480
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:08,193
And for some reason
I thought to myself,

481
00:30:09,515 --> 00:30:12,087
"Yeah, man, I can do better",

482
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,370
so I started from scratch.

483
00:30:14,495 --> 00:30:15,619
I made another,

484
00:30:15,744 --> 00:30:16,992
then another,

485
00:30:17,654 --> 00:30:21,104
and by the end of the semester,
by, like, box number five,

486
00:30:22,015 --> 00:30:23,665
I had built this thing.

487
00:30:26,055 --> 00:30:28,823
You should've seen it.
It was insane.

488
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,606
I built it out of Peruvian Walnut

489
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:35,347
with inlaid Zebrawood.

490
00:30:36,031 --> 00:30:37,880
It was fitted with pegs, no screws.

491
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:41,797
I sanded it for days
until it was smooth as glass.

492
00:30:42,226 --> 00:30:45,384
Then I rubbed all the wood
with tung oil so it was...

493
00:30:45,965 --> 00:30:47,165
rich and dark.

494
00:30:48,104 --> 00:30:49,654
It even smelled good.

495
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,597
You know, you put your nose in it

496
00:30:51,722 --> 00:30:54,101
and breathed in, it was...

497
00:30:57,728 --> 00:30:58,978
It was perfect.

498
00:30:59,807 --> 00:31:01,557
What happened to the box?

499
00:31:06,418 --> 00:31:07,918
I gave it to my mom.

500
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:10,930
Nice.

501
00:31:12,974 --> 00:31:14,914
You know what I'm going to say,
don't you?

502
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:16,836
It's never too late.

503
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:21,587
They have art co-ops
that offer classes,

504
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:24,443
adult extension program
at the university.

505
00:31:24,568 --> 00:31:27,692
You know,
I didn't give the box to my mom.

506
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:33,072
I traded it for an ounce of weed.

507
00:31:42,145 --> 00:31:44,515
He's a hero.
You don't deny coverage to a hero.

508
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,463
They'll say
they're not denying coverage.

509
00:31:46,588 --> 00:31:48,077
No, I'm agreeing with you,

510
00:31:48,202 --> 00:31:50,652
but I went through all this
with Walt.

511
00:31:51,522 --> 00:31:54,339
You'll burn through your savings,
and then what?

512
00:31:54,464 --> 00:31:56,114
You two managed, right?

513
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,791
You said yourself
that Elliot and Gretchen's money

514
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,954
didn't cover everything.

515
00:32:03,162 --> 00:32:04,375
I've got to get back.

516
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,384
What? No.

517
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:08,541
No, you should rest.

518
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:11,657
Look, why don't you go in
and take a long bath

519
00:32:11,782 --> 00:32:13,434
I put some fresh sheets on the bed.

520
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,391
I want to be there
in case he wakes up.

521
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,245
With all they're giving him,
he'll sleep till morning.

522
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:25,734
What are you doing here?

523
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,404
I just thought I'd stop by
to see how you're holding up.

524
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,322
Is this a bad time, or...

525
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:36,196
Marie, this is Ted, my boss.

526
00:32:36,671 --> 00:32:37,913
Oh, you're Ted.

527
00:32:38,662 --> 00:32:40,472
I've heard so much about you.

528
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,626
Thank you for your gift basket.
That was really thoughtful.

529
00:32:43,751 --> 00:32:46,848
- It was really nice. Thank you.
- Cheese sticks.

530
00:32:46,973 --> 00:32:47,923
You're welcome.

531
00:32:48,297 --> 00:32:49,703
We care about Skyler so much

532
00:32:49,828 --> 00:32:52,064
that naturally
that extends to the whole family.

533
00:32:53,927 --> 00:32:55,327
Are you coming in?

534
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,342
Yeah, you should.
I'm sorry.

535
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:00,767
Come on in, Ted.

536
00:33:02,162 --> 00:33:04,470
We were just having some wine.
Would you like a glass?

537
00:33:04,595 --> 00:33:05,806
No, thanks.

538
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:07,566
I'm just on my way home.

539
00:33:07,691 --> 00:33:10,025
- I just thought I'd...
- You know, I...

540
00:33:10,538 --> 00:33:13,665
I am really beat.
I think I'm going to take that bath.

541
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:16,160
It was nice to meet you, Ted,
and thank you again.

542
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:20,247
Nice to meet you, too, Marie.
Give my best wishes to your husband.

543
00:33:20,992 --> 00:33:21,992
I will.

544
00:33:26,536 --> 00:33:28,672
Thanks for stopping by,

545
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,315
but it's actually not a...

546
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,372
not the best time for a visit, so...

547
00:33:33,497 --> 00:33:36,993
Can we just talk for a minute?

548
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:40,098
I know you need to be
with your family, but...

549
00:33:41,443 --> 00:33:43,395
I haven't heard from you in days

550
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,419
- I left messages...
- I'm so sorry.

551
00:33:45,544 --> 00:33:47,274
You gave me all that time off,
and I...

552
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,942
That's not my point.

553
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,570
I care about you. That's all.

554
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:56,601
It's just this whole thing with Hank
has been one non-stop horror show,

555
00:33:56,726 --> 00:33:57,976
you know, so...

556
00:34:00,949 --> 00:34:03,540
I just want you to know
that I'm here for you.

557
00:34:04,096 --> 00:34:05,096
Thank you.

558
00:34:06,938 --> 00:34:10,511
But I really do need you to...

559
00:34:17,342 --> 00:34:20,224
Skyler, I've got to say
your sister seeing me here...

560
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,349
I mean...

561
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:22,977
So what?

562
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:26,261
I'm divorced.
You're divorced. So what?

563
00:34:26,386 --> 00:34:28,357
Let's talk about it later, okay?

564
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:30,957
Is there some reason for secrecy
I'm not getting? Because...

565
00:34:31,082 --> 00:34:32,069
Not now.

566
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,057
- Just tell me...
- You really want to do this now?

567
00:34:35,182 --> 00:34:37,533
Are you really going
to make me do this right now?

568
00:34:44,809 --> 00:34:46,259
Yeah, you're right.

569
00:34:46,474 --> 00:34:48,074
Bad idea to come here.

570
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:55,972
I'll see you in a day or two.

571
00:34:56,941 --> 00:34:58,387
Back at the office.

572
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:01,869
Take as much time as you want.

573
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:12,533
I can't believe
you had to crush the RV.

574
00:35:13,317 --> 00:35:14,867
Must've been, like...

575
00:35:14,998 --> 00:35:16,134
depressing.

576
00:35:16,259 --> 00:35:18,453
For real. That's a stone loss.

577
00:35:19,103 --> 00:35:21,103
No one misses it more than me.

578
00:35:21,228 --> 00:35:23,886
Free to cook anytime, anywhere.

579
00:35:24,011 --> 00:35:26,665
No quotas, no one to answer to.

580
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:31,295
What's the point of being an outlaw
when you've got responsibilities?

581
00:35:32,804 --> 00:35:34,999
Darth Vader had responsibilities.

582
00:35:35,124 --> 00:35:36,766
He was responsible
for the Death Star.

583
00:35:36,891 --> 00:35:38,941
True that. Two of them bitches.

584
00:35:41,196 --> 00:35:43,505
Just saying. Devil's advocate.

585
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:45,815
I've got to pay taxes now?
What the hell?

586
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,270
That's messed up. That's Kafkaesque.

587
00:35:50,601 --> 00:35:52,202
- Church.
- Right.

588
00:35:54,537 --> 00:35:56,563
Let's kick it back into gear.

589
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,489
Let's start slinging again.

590
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,362
Let's do it.
Life's too short. That's what I say.

591
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:07,080
Hell, yeah. We don't need no RV.

592
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,168
Alls we need is a bicycle,

593
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:12,044
- some Drano, soda bottles...
- Nah, no shake 'n bake.

594
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:14,129
Where's your self-respect? Come on.

595
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,724
Maybe it ain't top shelf,
but we could at least move it.

596
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:19,384
Still kind of dry out there.
It'll sell on the street.

597
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,432
Who says we sell on the street?

598
00:36:21,942 --> 00:36:24,042
Maybe I know a whole new market.

599
00:36:24,421 --> 00:36:26,471
Maybe alls we need is the meth.

600
00:37:02,683 --> 00:37:04,012
What's the yield?

601
00:37:08,361 --> 00:37:09,811
The yield. Come on.

602
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:13,856
201.8.

603
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,707
I see a couple new faces.

604
00:37:33,305 --> 00:37:35,705
Anybody want to introduce
themselves?

605
00:37:37,443 --> 00:37:39,143
Don't all speak at once.

606
00:37:50,957 --> 00:37:52,357
My name's Brandon.

607
00:37:55,296 --> 00:37:57,577
You want to tell us something
about yourself?

608
00:37:58,921 --> 00:38:00,171
Why I'm here...

609
00:38:01,033 --> 00:38:03,547
it's just one thing.

610
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:06,183
It's meth.

611
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,140
It's bad.

612
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,919
Thought I had it kicked
a couple times, you know,

613
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:18,003
but then... Jesus.

614
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,140
This new version of it
hit the streets and...

615
00:38:24,006 --> 00:38:25,506
Not that blue stuff.

616
00:38:27,463 --> 00:38:29,606
Sorry, I didn't raise my hand.

617
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:30,557
Go ahead.

618
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:31,872
This is what we do.

619
00:38:31,997 --> 00:38:33,997
Yeah, exactly, the blue stuff.

620
00:38:35,538 --> 00:38:36,605
You had it, too.

621
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:37,773
Yeah, bro.

622
00:38:38,362 --> 00:38:40,462
I wish I never even heard of it.

623
00:38:40,755 --> 00:38:43,584
It was like lighting
my whole head on fire.

624
00:38:44,895 --> 00:38:46,453
Stuff will burn you down.

625
00:38:46,578 --> 00:38:48,774
Only reason I have a hope in hell

626
00:38:48,899 --> 00:38:51,052
is because it's long gone.

627
00:38:52,187 --> 00:38:53,460
That's the shame of it.

628
00:38:55,705 --> 00:38:58,585
- Don't tell me that.
- I hear it's back in town.

629
00:39:02,962 --> 00:39:05,175
Stay strong, brother. Stay strong.

630
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,650
It's gonna be okay.

631
00:39:21,488 --> 00:39:25,237
I swear to God, I'll do it.
I will go to the press.

632
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,951
I will go to <i>48 Hours.</i>
I will go to <i>Nightline.</i>

633
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:30,299
Maybe <i>Nightline</i> doesn't exist anymore.
It doesn't matter.

634
00:39:30,424 --> 00:39:33,044
They will all take it,
and they will run with it

635
00:39:33,169 --> 00:39:34,592
because he is a hero,

636
00:39:34,717 --> 00:39:38,252
and he is not going to be
in a wheelchair at 43.

637
00:39:48,298 --> 00:39:50,748
I know
Skyler's already told you this,

638
00:39:51,211 --> 00:39:53,961
but if there's every
anything that you need,

639
00:39:54,331 --> 00:39:55,434
anything at all...

640
00:39:56,287 --> 00:39:58,137
It's good to have you here.

641
00:39:59,201 --> 00:40:00,301
Both of you.

642
00:40:01,978 --> 00:40:03,678
I just wish there was...

643
00:40:03,803 --> 00:40:05,903
something more that we could do.

644
00:40:17,461 --> 00:40:19,374
We can always pay their bills.

645
00:40:21,793 --> 00:40:24,413
Please,
it's tens of thousands of dollars.

646
00:40:24,538 --> 00:40:25,630
We have the money,

647
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,148
more than enough.

648
00:40:27,586 --> 00:40:28,836
Walt earned it.

649
00:40:29,695 --> 00:40:31,387
I think Marie should know the truth.

650
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:35,209
Skyler, I really don't think
this is a good idea.

651
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,559
- I think that...
- He earned it gambling.

652
00:40:42,493 --> 00:40:44,272
Walt and I...

653
00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:48,528
We've had our problems lately.
You know that.

654
00:40:50,966 --> 00:40:52,299
And...

655
00:40:53,613 --> 00:40:57,303
what it all came down to
really was...

656
00:40:58,062 --> 00:40:59,062
money.

657
00:41:00,223 --> 00:41:01,523
Pure and simple.

658
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:04,419
When Walt was diagnosed, it...

659
00:41:06,682 --> 00:41:07,932
It changed him.

660
00:41:09,943 --> 00:41:13,199
Looking back, I don't think
I ever really understood

661
00:41:13,324 --> 00:41:15,764
what it was
that he was going through.

662
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:18,701
It was more than facing death.

663
00:41:18,826 --> 00:41:21,933
It was knowing
that he was going to leave behind...

664
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,064
nothing.

665
00:41:27,332 --> 00:41:30,682
And so that's how this all started.
For better or worse,

666
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,510
he wanted to provide,

667
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:35,075
and so...

668
00:41:37,386 --> 00:41:41,154
he paid his medical bills
the only way he knew how.

669
00:41:42,919 --> 00:41:46,538
I thought that Elliot and Gretchen
paid for your treatment.

670
00:41:46,663 --> 00:41:48,363
Yeah, I thought so, too,

671
00:41:49,024 --> 00:41:51,814
but the truth is
he never took their money, not a dime.

672
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:56,089
He was too proud to take
what he considered to be charity.

673
00:41:57,891 --> 00:41:58,932
Isn't that right?

674
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:07,357
He put his mind to it and...

675
00:42:11,232 --> 00:42:12,871
You know how Walt is.

676
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:15,509
He's a problem solver,

677
00:42:16,037 --> 00:42:17,467
and he read books,

678
00:42:17,592 --> 00:42:21,068
and he did a whole
bunch of research,

679
00:42:21,193 --> 00:42:22,793
and he came up with...

680
00:42:23,779 --> 00:42:25,258
this system.

681
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:27,219
A system?

682
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:31,921
A system for counting cards
in Blackjack.

683
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:35,709
What do you mean, like Rain Man?

684
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:40,243
I don't pretend to understand,
you know, all the details,

685
00:42:40,368 --> 00:42:43,678
but he was convinced
that if you put enough money into it,

686
00:42:43,803 --> 00:42:45,003
he'd have a...

687
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,383
God, what is it?

688
00:42:48,174 --> 00:42:50,006
A statistical edge?

689
00:42:52,922 --> 00:42:55,051
Yes, statistical...

690
00:42:57,198 --> 00:42:59,302
So he...
Every spare minute,

691
00:42:59,427 --> 00:43:02,098
Walt was at some
card table somewhere,

692
00:43:02,223 --> 00:43:04,292
and at first he went to the casinos,

693
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:06,317
but then he realized that...

694
00:43:09,542 --> 00:43:10,817
But then he realized

695
00:43:10,942 --> 00:43:14,189
that the casinos report
your winnings to the IRS,

696
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:17,020
and if it gets reported,
your family might find out,

697
00:43:17,145 --> 00:43:19,382
and if you do not want
your family to find out,

698
00:43:19,507 --> 00:43:21,514
then you find another place
to gamble,

699
00:43:21,968 --> 00:43:24,339
like an illegal,

700
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,102
backroom game.

701
00:43:27,555 --> 00:43:31,171
You remember all those long walks
that Walt used to take,

702
00:43:31,798 --> 00:43:33,401
all that time

703
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,669
he used to spend away from home?

704
00:43:38,672 --> 00:43:41,277
I guess for a couple months there
you were...

705
00:43:41,402 --> 00:43:44,102
sort of leading a double life,
weren't you?

706
00:43:53,217 --> 00:43:54,547
Your fugue state,

707
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,966
was that some sort of cover?

708
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,869
He did not fake that, Marie.

709
00:44:00,343 --> 00:44:02,543
The night that Walt disappeared...

710
00:44:06,649 --> 00:44:09,112
he lost $14,000.

711
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:13,599
It was his pension fund,

712
00:44:13,724 --> 00:44:14,824
our savings,

713
00:44:15,648 --> 00:44:19,070
basically every last dime
we had to our name,

714
00:44:19,195 --> 00:44:20,195
gone.

715
00:44:21,733 --> 00:44:23,752
He couldn't live with it.

716
00:44:24,541 --> 00:44:25,950
He was suicidal.

717
00:44:26,641 --> 00:44:28,698
But you have to understand

718
00:44:28,823 --> 00:44:31,373
that as soon as he got out
of the hospital,

719
00:44:31,498 --> 00:44:33,008
he went right back to gambling.

720
00:44:33,133 --> 00:44:36,421
I mean, that's how deep this went.

721
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:38,858
How could you

722
00:44:39,945 --> 00:44:41,853
do that to her, Walt?

723
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:46,725
Anyway, this system of his...

724
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:50,197
he finally got it to work.

725
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,283
So all this is to say

726
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:56,761
we have the money.

727
00:44:56,886 --> 00:44:58,918
No more gambling.

728
00:45:01,591 --> 00:45:03,191
But we have the money.

729
00:45:05,223 --> 00:45:09,063
How... much money?

730
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:25,597
It's in the seven figures.

731
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,083
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

732
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:32,180
What can I say?

733
00:45:33,956 --> 00:45:35,256
I did very well.

734
00:45:39,852 --> 00:45:42,359
You will take our money.

735
00:45:44,464 --> 00:45:47,660
Use it to take care of Hank.

736
00:45:48,669 --> 00:45:49,669
Please.

737
00:45:50,216 --> 00:45:51,666
Marie, let us help.

738
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,310
- Does Walt, Jr. Know about this?
- Absolutely not,

739
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,840
and I need to keep it that way,

740
00:46:00,188 --> 00:46:03,064
and Hank's got enough
on his mind right now,

741
00:46:03,189 --> 00:46:05,979
so can we just please
keep this between us?

742
00:46:08,777 --> 00:46:10,377
I just... I need to...

743
00:46:11,122 --> 00:46:12,922
We'll talk about it later.

744
00:46:14,194 --> 00:46:16,194
How did you come up with that?

745
00:46:17,876 --> 00:46:20,652
I mean, where did you possibly...

746
00:46:22,511 --> 00:46:24,211
I learned from the best.

747
00:46:30,569 --> 00:46:34,565
Somehow something tells me

748
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:37,085
that Hank is here because of you.

749
00:46:38,737 --> 00:46:41,979
And I'm not forgetting that.
