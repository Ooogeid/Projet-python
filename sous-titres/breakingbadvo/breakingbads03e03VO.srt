00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:03,594
I want you gone.

3
00:00:04,811 --> 00:00:06,339
I loved her.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,842
You come in here,
and you wave these papers in my face.

5
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:11,508
You're a drug dealer.

6
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:13,512
- Three million dollars.
- I'm done.

7
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:16,182
What are you telling me, <i>tio</i>?
Are they punking me?

8
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,603
Where's the meet?
When's it going down?

9
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:24,472
What's the matter? You act like you
never saw a severed head on a tortoise.

He's still breathing.

13
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,102
By the looks of him,
he has no idea how close he came.

14
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,519
I'm assuming Saul Goodman
doesn't need to know.

15
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,592
Mum's the word.

16
00:05:59,857 --> 00:06:01,545
Son of a bitch!

17
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:17,983
Hang on, baby.

18
00:06:30,504 --> 00:06:31,338
<i>Hello.</i>

19
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,976
Walt, are you in the house?

20
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:39,481
<i>It's me.</i>

21
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:43,902
What the hell
are you doing in there?

22
00:06:44,712 --> 00:06:45,614
<i>I'm back.</i>

23
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,310
You're not back.

24
00:06:48,435 --> 00:06:51,285
Walt, you're not back.
Get out of there.

25
00:06:52,363 --> 00:06:53,915
<i>It's my house, too, Skyler.</i>

26
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,840
<i>I'm staying. End of story.</i>

27
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:59,789
- We had an agreement.
- <i>I didn't agree to anything.</i>

28
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,731
<i>Just come on inside,
and we'll talk this through.</i>

29
00:07:05,313 --> 00:07:06,947
There's nothing to talk about.

30
00:07:07,148 --> 00:07:10,764
I am not coming in there
until you get out.

31
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,530
<i>Suit yourself.</i>

32
00:07:44,413 --> 00:07:46,799
What is wrong with you?

33
00:07:47,727 --> 00:07:49,541
I have every right to be here.

34
00:07:50,227 --> 00:07:51,191
You don't.

35
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:53,613
You don't live here anymore.

36
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:56,229
- We're getting a divorce.
- I don't agree to a divorce.

37
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:57,768
It's not up to you.

38
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:02,689
If you don't get out of here
right now,

39
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,304
I'm going to call the police

40
00:08:04,429 --> 00:08:07,286
and I'm going to tell them
everything.

41
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,679
I mean it.

42
00:08:34,398 --> 00:08:35,636
It's ringing.

43
00:08:40,815 --> 00:08:42,402
<i>Albuquerque Police Department,</i>

44
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:45,262
<i>Operator #314B.
How may I help you?</i>

45
00:08:47,412 --> 00:08:49,805
<i>Albuquerque Police Department.
How may I help you?</i>

46
00:08:52,358 --> 00:08:54,863
I want to report
a disturbance, please.

47
00:08:58,229 --> 00:09:00,182
It's not exactly...
It's,

48
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,907
It's a domestic issue.

49
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:11,967
They're connecting me.

50
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:16,181
Right hand to God, I will tell them.

51
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:19,224
Do what you have to do, Skyler.

52
00:09:20,297 --> 00:09:23,157
This family is everything to me.

53
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:25,431
Without it,

54
00:09:26,248 --> 00:09:27,614
I have nothing to lose.

55
00:09:27,952 --> 00:09:28,650
Fine.

56
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:33,466
Yes, my name is Skyler White.

57
00:09:34,252 --> 00:09:36,885
I need police assistance
at my home right away.

58
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,285
My...

59
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,555
soon-to-be ex-husband

60
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,108
broke into my house,

61
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:45,206
and I need an officer

62
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:46,752
to come and remove him.

63
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:51,586
It's 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.

64
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:00,246
Thank you.

65
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,814
They're coming.

66
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:59,583
Dad's here?

67
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,432
How are you, son?

68
00:11:02,077 --> 00:11:03,054
How are you?

69
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:06,541
Are you back for good?

70
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:08,909
Why are you home so soon?

71
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:10,952
I'm not.

72
00:11:13,797 --> 00:11:15,960
I am starving.
How about a grilled cheese?

73
00:11:16,085 --> 00:11:17,843
- Sure.
- You want one, too?

74
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:20,208
Your dad and I have something
we need to discuss.

75
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:23,008
When your sandwich
is ready I'll bring it to your...

76
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:24,266
to your room.

77
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:26,543
Mom, can't it wait?

78
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:29,150
I haven't seen Dad in,
like, forever.

79
00:11:30,313 --> 00:11:31,383
How's the school?

80
00:11:31,508 --> 00:11:32,522
It was good.

81
00:11:32,647 --> 00:11:34,773
- Homework?
- Not really.

82
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,695
Not really? What does that mean?

83
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:48,832
Are you gonna be at work tomorrow?

84
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:50,592
That's the plan.

85
00:12:06,044 --> 00:12:07,851
We were called about a disturbance?

86
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:10,973
It's more of a trespassing situation,
really, but...

87
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,384
that was me.

88
00:12:15,937 --> 00:12:19,333
You called the cops on Dad?

89
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:26,720
I came home from work,
and he was back.

90
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,541
He just moved back into the house.

91
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:32,633
And I asked him to leave,
but he won't listen.

92
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,726
I just...

93
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:37,331
I want him out.

94
00:12:38,134 --> 00:12:40,277
I want him out of the house.

95
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:43,404
I need to ask you a couple of questions
right off of the bat.

96
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,455
It's important that you answer
them honestly. Did he strike you?

97
00:12:48,578 --> 00:12:49,757
Has he ever hit you?

98
00:12:50,185 --> 00:12:52,078
No. This is not about

99
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:54,940
violence.
This is about trespassing,

100
00:12:55,678 --> 00:12:56,470
about him

101
00:12:56,731 --> 00:12:58,735
being here against my will.

102
00:12:58,969 --> 00:12:59,975
Trespassing.

103
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:01,610
You're divorced, then?

104
00:13:01,735 --> 00:13:03,588
No, working on it.

105
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:06,849
- Right now we're separated.
- Legally separated?

106
00:13:08,094 --> 00:13:10,362
There's not a court order,
if that's what you mean,

107
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:12,835
but we've been living apart
for almost

108
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,850
two weeks, give or take...
I changed the locks.

109
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:18,316
Isn't that breaking and entering?

110
00:13:18,441 --> 00:13:20,215
Whose name
is on the title to the house?

111
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,153
Both of us.

112
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:23,724
It's jointly owned.

113
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:26,282
We can't arrest a man
for breaking into his own house,

114
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:28,932
not without a court order requiring
he stays away from the premises,

115
00:13:29,572 --> 00:13:31,840
unless he's threatened you
or the kids in any way.

116
00:13:33,474 --> 00:13:36,331
Not physically,
but having him in the house is just...

117
00:13:37,964 --> 00:13:39,920
It's not a good thing.

118
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:41,491
Excuse me.

119
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:44,863
I got her, honey.

120
00:13:45,846 --> 00:13:46,908
Come here.

121
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,145
There we go.

122
00:13:49,116 --> 00:13:50,299
You hungry?

123
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:51,929
You hungry?

124
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:56,293
That was it.

125
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,949
I'm sorry, Officer.
Where were we?

126
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:00,964
Disagreements.

127
00:14:02,574 --> 00:14:04,449
So we've had our share of that.

128
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:07,061
I haven't...

129
00:14:07,965 --> 00:14:10,390
I haven't been the most attentive
husband lately.

130
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:17,035
Would this be easier
if we stepped outside for a minute?

131
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,460
I'm fine right here.

132
00:14:27,422 --> 00:14:28,924
I'm gonna level with you, ma'am.

133
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:31,578
If you want him out of the house,
you're gonna have to help me out.

134
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:35,243
Is it possible maybe he's broken
any laws that you know of?

135
00:14:35,448 --> 00:14:36,484
Anything at all.

136
00:14:37,395 --> 00:14:39,529
Anything that we can work with here,
just tell me.

137
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:43,882
Even if you've just got a suspicion
of wrongdoing, I can work with that.

138
00:14:45,381 --> 00:14:46,818
What's your take on all this?

139
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:49,513
It's my mom's fault.

140
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,493
She won't even say what my dad did,

141
00:14:54,618 --> 00:14:57,938
and it's because
he didn't do anything.

142
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,506
I don't know why
she's being this way.

143
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,001
But my dad...

144
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:05,420
... he is a great guy.

145
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:09,416
Son. It's not your mom's fault.

146
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:11,561
Mrs. White?

147
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,375
I'm sorry, ma'am.
There's no legal basis for us

148
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,506
to remove your husband
from the house.

149
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:24,768
Next time you feel like
things are getting out of control,

150
00:15:24,893 --> 00:15:25,924
call this number.

151
00:15:26,353 --> 00:15:28,053
It's the family hotline.

152
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,667
I'd really look
into some counseling.

153
00:15:32,923 --> 00:15:34,224
Best of luck to you.

154
00:15:34,461 --> 00:15:37,102
Listen, thank you, officers.
We're sorry.

155
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,904
Why do you got to do this to Dad?

156
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:51,379
Junior. Wait. Come on.
Don't blame your mother for this.

157
00:15:56,508 --> 00:15:57,508
Sorry.

158
00:16:15,377 --> 00:16:16,527
Welcome home.

159
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,451


160
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:00,389
He lives!

161
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,453
Happy housewarming, kid.

162
00:17:03,317 --> 00:17:05,565
- Don't look so glad to see me.
- Thanks.

163
00:17:06,195 --> 00:17:07,595
Interesting decor.

164
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,168
It's... subtle.

165
00:17:09,853 --> 00:17:13,114
The whole minimalist thing
never really blew my hair back, but hey.

166
00:17:15,552 --> 00:17:16,774
How are you doing?

167
00:17:16,899 --> 00:17:18,299
You staying clean?

168
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:21,044
Good.

169
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:23,667
I was kind of worried
that you were back to old habits,

170
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:26,059
since I didn't hear from you,
you know?

171
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:30,098
Realize how stupid it is
to ignore your counsel's phone calls?

172
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:33,635
What if I was trying to warn you
that the DEA was going to come?

173
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,253
What then?

174
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,478
Why don't you spare me the sermon
and get to why you're here?

175
00:17:38,603 --> 00:17:39,516
Fair enough.

176
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:41,932
Remember when I brought up the idea

177
00:17:42,057 --> 00:17:44,907
of you getting back in touch
with your partner?

178
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:47,482
I kind of wanted
to refloat that boat.

179
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,586
I'm not suggesting that you yourself
get back to cooking,

180
00:17:50,711 --> 00:17:52,904
I mean, you being in rehab and all.

181
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,622
I only want you to convince
the master chef to do his thing.

182
00:17:57,392 --> 00:17:58,692
What do you say?

183
00:18:00,186 --> 00:18:02,789
- Sure, man. Whatever.
- Okay. Whatever what?

184
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:05,079
I mean, you going to call him?

185
00:18:05,654 --> 00:18:07,070
I said I'll handle it.

186
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:09,754
Now bounce, will you?
Please?

187
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,122
Final thought.

188
00:18:13,155 --> 00:18:15,241
Look at this place.
You're house poor.

189
00:18:15,598 --> 00:18:17,023
You got no bankroll.

190
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:19,848
If you get the maestro cooking again,
I'll make it worth your while.

191
00:18:22,943 --> 00:18:23,810
Call him.

192
00:19:10,838 --> 00:19:13,616
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four little words for you...</i>

193
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:14,852
<i>do not call list.</i>

194
00:19:14,977 --> 00:19:17,361
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

195
00:19:40,573 --> 00:19:41,573
Schrader.

196
00:19:42,401 --> 00:19:44,251
Yes, sir?
Yeah, what's up?

197
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:54,018
That's great news, sir. Thank you.

198
00:19:54,982 --> 00:19:57,732
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.
You can bet on that.

199
00:19:58,742 --> 00:20:00,319
Hey, listen, thanks again, sir.

200
00:20:00,444 --> 00:20:03,149
I really appreciate
you stepping to the plate. Thank you.

201
00:20:07,636 --> 00:20:09,123
You going to keep me in suspense?

202
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,210
- What's the good news?
- Merkert called in a couple of favors.

203
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:14,071
El Paso wants me back.

204
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:18,083
Hey, man, congrats, man.
That's fantastic.

205
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,208
Thank you.

206
00:21:03,643 --> 00:21:04,643
Hello.

207
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,689


208
00:26:37,547 --> 00:26:40,339
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four little words for you...</i>

209
00:26:40,464 --> 00:26:41,534
<i>do not call list.</i>

210
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:44,182
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

211
00:26:56,208 --> 00:26:59,019
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four little words for you...</i>

212
00:26:59,144 --> 00:27:00,368
<i>do not call list.</i>

213
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:03,003
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

214
00:27:05,873 --> 00:27:08,584
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four little words for you...</i>

215
00:27:49,944 --> 00:27:51,114
Oh, sweetheart.

216
00:27:51,242 --> 00:27:52,892
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

217
00:27:53,017 --> 00:27:54,861
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

218
00:27:55,795 --> 00:27:57,464
It's okay, my girl.

219
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,180
It's okay.

220
00:28:00,988 --> 00:28:02,622
It's okay. Mama's got you.

221
00:28:11,804 --> 00:28:13,454
Skyler, want some help?

222
00:28:25,192 --> 00:28:27,468
Skyler, can I use the bathroom?

223
00:29:01,672 --> 00:29:03,550
What do you mean?
Against your will?

224
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,903
Very much against my will.

225
00:29:06,028 --> 00:29:08,120
He just...
He showed right back up,

226
00:29:08,356 --> 00:29:10,291
and he doesn't want a divorce.

227
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,066
Won't even consider it.

228
00:29:13,067 --> 00:29:15,350
I... I called the police on him.

229
00:29:16,947 --> 00:29:18,731
I was so clo...

230
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,675
So close to what?

231
00:29:21,992 --> 00:29:23,492
Nothing. Never mind.

232
00:29:24,978 --> 00:29:29,145
Skyler, I can't advise you properly
if you don't give me all the facts.

233
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,007
Understand I am bound
by the attorney-client privilege

234
00:29:33,132 --> 00:29:35,106
to keep everything you tell me
a secret.

235
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:38,174
I can't tell a soul
unless you authorize me to.

236
00:29:39,072 --> 00:29:41,122
Even if it's something illegal?

237
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,900
Especially if it's illegal.

238
00:29:44,488 --> 00:29:46,346
I'm your lawyer, not the police.

239
00:29:46,471 --> 00:29:48,221
My job is to protect you.

240
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,270
My husband makes meth.

241
00:30:03,138 --> 00:30:04,438
Methamphetamine.

242
00:30:08,234 --> 00:30:10,599
- Your husband's a drug dealer.
- A manufacturer.

243
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,430
Technically, they...

244
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,460
They call them cooks.

245
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:18,941
I looked it up on the Internet.

246
00:30:19,645 --> 00:30:21,045
This is my advice,

247
00:30:21,231 --> 00:30:22,881
and you should take it.

248
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:25,865
Sue your husband
for divorce immediately.

249
00:30:26,212 --> 00:30:29,807
Let me go to the police
and tell them what you've just told me.

250
00:30:29,932 --> 00:30:31,076
I'll go in <i>ex parte</i>

251
00:30:31,201 --> 00:30:33,427
to get a restraining order
from the court today.

252
00:30:33,552 --> 00:30:35,744
If he comes anywhere near you
and your children,

253
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:38,377
he goes straight to jail,
no questions asked.

254
00:30:38,933 --> 00:30:40,147
This is a no-brainer.

255
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:42,798
It's the best thing
for you and your family.

256
00:30:45,772 --> 00:30:46,772
I can't.

257
00:30:50,104 --> 00:30:51,096
I can't do it.

258
00:30:52,647 --> 00:30:55,727
I don't want my son to find out

259
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,063
that his father is a criminal.

260
00:30:58,767 --> 00:30:59,767
I just...

261
00:31:01,095 --> 00:31:03,010
I can't do that to him.

262
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:06,091
In the end, it may not be up to you.

263
00:31:07,484 --> 00:31:09,533
Drug dealers have a way
of getting caught.

264
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:13,834
Walt has lung cancer.

265
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,702
His treatment bought him some time,

266
00:31:17,827 --> 00:31:20,477
but the doctors say
that sooner or later...

267
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:26,311
But I can't see why I should lay
all this on my family when...

268
00:31:28,005 --> 00:31:29,155
things may...

269
00:31:31,841 --> 00:31:34,807
resolve themselves on their own

270
00:31:36,652 --> 00:31:39,522
without anyone else knowing.

271
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,809
Man, did I lose a bet or something?

272
00:31:50,677 --> 00:31:53,322
- What are we doing in this shit hole?
- Just relax, will you?

273
00:31:53,589 --> 00:31:55,932
Relax? This is the kind of place
you get knifed.

274
00:31:56,057 --> 00:31:57,671
We should have went to Chili's, man.

275
00:31:57,796 --> 00:31:59,596
All right, already. Jesus.

276
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,236
Outback Steakhouse.

277
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:04,311
It's not too late.
They got that Blooming Onion.

278
00:32:04,554 --> 00:32:06,719
What's wrong with spicing
things up a little bit?

279
00:32:06,844 --> 00:32:09,468
This spice looks like it's been through
a couple of guys already.

280
00:32:11,628 --> 00:32:14,328
So when are you headed
back down to El Paso?

281
00:32:14,453 --> 00:32:17,522
You know,
between the packing and errands

282
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:21,171
and getting my ducks in a row,
maybe a week or two.

283
00:32:21,296 --> 00:32:22,496
A week or two?

284
00:32:22,621 --> 00:32:24,900
Come on, man.
I'd be dying to get back in the action.

285
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,488
Yeah, well, it's not like
there's nothing going on up here.

286
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:30,687
What are you talking about?
There ain't jack going on up here.

287
00:32:31,017 --> 00:32:32,467
It's quiet as hell.

288
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,830
I'm going to hit the head.

289
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:09,078
Those two over there.

290
00:33:10,214 --> 00:33:11,914
I think they're holding.

291
00:33:13,714 --> 00:33:16,864
Man, in this place,
the bartender's probably holding.

292
00:33:21,756 --> 00:33:22,602
All right.

293
00:33:22,727 --> 00:33:25,377
- What are you doing?
- Calling APD. What do you think?

294
00:33:25,933 --> 00:33:28,059
Since when can't we handle
a couple of dirtballs?

295
00:33:28,184 --> 00:33:30,084
Come on, man. Courtesy call.

296
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:33,259
What if Vice is running
some kind if undercover op?

297
00:33:36,297 --> 00:33:37,247
Screw it.

298
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:39,535
It's your turn to pay.

299
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,524
- Where are you going?
- I have to take a leak.

300
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:18,749
Jesus, get yourself some Flomax.

301
00:34:30,462 --> 00:34:31,412
Stand up.

302
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,040
Do you got a problem with us, bitch?

303
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,540
Your move.

304
00:35:13,103 --> 00:35:15,154
DEA! Don't move.

305
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,203
Go tell my partner
to get his ass in here.

306
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,019
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four little words for you,</i>

307
00:36:01,144 --> 00:36:02,191
<i>do not call list.</i>

308
00:36:02,316 --> 00:36:05,116
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

309
00:36:16,714 --> 00:36:19,595
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four little words for you,</i>

310
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,870
<i>do not call...</i>

311
00:36:33,895 --> 00:36:37,794
<i>The number you have reached 149-4985</i>

312
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:41,225
<i>in area code 505 is no longer in...</i>

313
00:38:21,061 --> 00:38:21,911
Skyler.

314
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,444
Can we talk?

315
00:38:42,627 --> 00:38:44,227
ASAC wants to see you.

316
00:38:46,764 --> 00:38:47,556
And?

317
00:38:48,432 --> 00:38:50,997
We're hanging back.
Saw a deal go down.

318
00:38:51,122 --> 00:38:52,930
I went outside to call it in.

319
00:38:53,055 --> 00:38:55,072
You stayed to keep an eye
on the suspects.

320
00:38:55,197 --> 00:38:57,197
That's when they attacked you.

321
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:06,285
What I didn't tell them
is that you left your gun

322
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,110
under the seat
before you went back inside.

323
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:27,083
I've done a terrible thing,

324
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:30,016
but I did it for a good reason.

325
00:39:32,292 --> 00:39:33,592
I did it for us.

326
00:39:36,396 --> 00:39:37,246
That...

327
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:41,779
is college tuition for Walter Junior

328
00:39:42,363 --> 00:39:45,397
and Holly, 18 years down the road.

329
00:39:49,742 --> 00:39:52,692
Then it's health insurance
for you and the kids,

330
00:39:53,936 --> 00:39:56,623
for Junior's physical therapy,

331
00:39:57,675 --> 00:39:58,875
his SAT tutor.

332
00:40:01,477 --> 00:40:03,177
It's money for groceries

333
00:40:05,078 --> 00:40:06,199
and gas,

334
00:40:07,306 --> 00:40:10,586
for birthdays
and graduation parties.

335
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:18,405
That money is for this roof
over your head,

336
00:40:19,293 --> 00:40:21,668
the mortgage that you are not going
to be able to afford

337
00:40:22,031 --> 00:40:24,722
on a part-time bookkeeper's salary
when I'm gone.

338
00:40:24,847 --> 00:40:26,465
- Walt, I...
- Please.

339
00:40:27,209 --> 00:40:28,059
Please.

340
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,215
This money...

341
00:40:37,176 --> 00:40:38,576
I didn't steal it.

342
00:40:38,881 --> 00:40:41,031
It doesn't belong to anyone else.

343
00:40:42,595 --> 00:40:43,695
I earned it.

344
00:40:45,638 --> 00:40:47,038
The things I've...

345
00:40:48,015 --> 00:40:49,415
done to earn it...

346
00:40:52,446 --> 00:40:53,246
The...

347
00:40:57,834 --> 00:40:58,634
the...

348
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:01,185
things I've had to do,

349
00:41:02,947 --> 00:41:06,105
I've got to live with them.

350
00:41:13,292 --> 00:41:14,142
Skyler.

351
00:41:18,149 --> 00:41:19,599
All that I've done,

352
00:41:20,568 --> 00:41:22,809
all the sacrifices that I have...

353
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,481
made for this family, all of that

354
00:41:27,233 --> 00:41:31,210
will be for nothing
if you don't accept what I've earned.

355
00:41:33,286 --> 00:41:34,136
Please.

356
00:41:39,175 --> 00:41:41,775
I'll be here
when you get home from work.

357
00:41:44,116 --> 00:41:46,266
You can give me your answer then.

358
00:42:08,881 --> 00:42:09,831
Hey, Sky.

359
00:43:09,701 --> 00:43:10,801
Some coffee?

360
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:12,799
Yeah.

361
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:16,041
That report's looking real good.

362
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:18,488
- I like how it looks.
- Good.

363
00:43:27,864 --> 00:43:29,314
Are your kids home?

364
00:44:10,016 --> 00:44:11,439
<i>Oh, it's here, it's here!</i>

365
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:12,928
<i>Everybody, come on in!</i>

366
00:44:15,835 --> 00:44:17,235
Hello, Mrs. White.

367
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:20,782
Hi, Louis.

368
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,758
Thanks for having me over
for dinner.

369
00:44:24,866 --> 00:44:25,816
Um, sure.

370
00:44:26,685 --> 00:44:27,785
Hey, Skyler.

371
00:44:29,484 --> 00:44:31,835
I'm, uh, cooking dinner.

372
00:44:32,624 --> 00:44:33,624
Pot roast.

373
00:44:35,569 --> 00:44:36,669
Could you...

374
00:44:56,385 --> 00:44:58,613
So how was your day?

375
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,592
Good.

376
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:04,699
Good. Excellent.

377
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:07,250
I hope you don't mind.

378
00:45:07,725 --> 00:45:10,425
I invited Louis to stay
for dinner tonight,

379
00:45:10,978 --> 00:45:14,668
you know, as a thank you for driving
Walter Junior to school for us.

380
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,150
We've been kind of absent,

381
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,701
but I tell you,
Louis really pitched in.

382
00:45:29,504 --> 00:45:31,704
Look, I just want to say that I...

383
00:45:33,003 --> 00:45:34,848
I feel good
about our talk this morning,

384
00:45:34,973 --> 00:45:37,773
I'm very eager to hear
what you're thinking about...

385
00:45:38,642 --> 00:45:40,259
about what we talked about.

386
00:45:40,384 --> 00:45:43,031
But, you know,
whenever you're ready, of course.

387
00:45:49,451 --> 00:45:52,476
Honesty is good.

388
00:45:52,736 --> 00:45:54,036
Don't you think?

389
00:46:17,265 --> 00:46:18,415
I fucked Ted.

390
00:46:28,268 --> 00:46:29,418
Boys, dinner.

391
00:46:32,783 --> 00:46:33,983
Who wants tea?

392
00:46:36,034 --> 00:46:37,734
- Louis?
- Yes, please.

393
00:46:41,185 --> 00:46:43,935
I want you boys both
to eat your salad, okay?

394
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,991
- Really?
- I know. Nobody likes salad,

395
00:46:48,838 --> 00:46:50,146
but it's good for you.

396
00:46:50,271 --> 00:46:52,371
- Thanks, darling.
- Thank you.
