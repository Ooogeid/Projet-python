2
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:08,382
If you're gonna launder the money,

3
00:00:08,739 --> 00:00:10,051
at least do it right.

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,262
- Be my guest.
- You sure?

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,713
I can cook, I can watch.

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,247
We're looking for someone trustworthy.
Who knows about laundering.

7
00:00:19,372 --> 00:00:20,394
What about me?

8
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,396
I know I owe you my life.

9
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:23,814
They got Tomás slinging,

10
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,091
then, they made him kill somebody.

11
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:29,945
Are you Tomás?

12
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,114
- Yeah. What you want?
- Crystal.

13
00:02:32,313 --> 00:02:33,313
Hey, guys.

16
00:03:22,544 --> 00:03:24,590
So if it's okay, I was thinking

17
00:03:24,715 --> 00:03:26,767
about using this one for the test.

18
00:03:27,869 --> 00:03:29,913
Mom's brakes are very sticky...

19
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:32,002
and you barely press down on them,

20
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,041
and it's like a screech.

21
00:03:35,753 --> 00:03:36,753
Sure.

22
00:03:38,413 --> 00:03:40,320
But I'm good?

23
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:42,959
Yeah, you're great.

24
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:44,084
Why?

25
00:03:45,578 --> 00:03:46,854
Are my feet okay?

26
00:03:52,395 --> 00:03:53,524
I looked it up.

27
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:57,467
New Mexico says all I need
is a note from a doctor.

28
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:00,009
I mean, I know it's
not the right way and all,

29
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:02,245
but once I get my provisional,

30
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,051
I can keep working at it.

31
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:10,386
As long as it gets you
safely from point A to point B,

32
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:12,161
then who am I to argue?

33
00:04:23,037 --> 00:04:24,037
Hi.

34
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:27,224
You're a sweet girl.
Yes, you are.

35
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,339
Yes, you are.

36
00:04:29,464 --> 00:04:30,978
I know.

37
00:04:31,232 --> 00:04:32,196
I know.

38
00:04:48,598 --> 00:04:50,188
There you go.
Here you go.

39
00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:51,313
All right.

40
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:52,608
Thank you.

41
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:54,998
Got it?

42
00:04:55,123 --> 00:04:56,590
Okay. All right.

43
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,495
So...

44
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,603
9 a.m. Saturday?

45
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:02,205
9 a.m. Saturday.

46
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,417
So, which means pick me up
about 8:30.

47
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:06,303
I'll be here with bells on.

48
00:05:06,428 --> 00:05:07,343
What?

49
00:05:07,468 --> 00:05:08,914
Just a saying.

50
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:10,935
Don't worry.
I won't be wearing bells.

51
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:13,408
Hey, Mom.

52
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,251
Hi. Do you have a minute?

53
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:17,932
- Could you keep an eye on your sister?
- Yeah, sure.

54
00:05:18,057 --> 00:05:19,472
- Thanks.
- See you, Dad.

55
00:05:19,597 --> 00:05:21,987
- Bye, son. Good work today.
- Thank you.

56
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,956
Have you thought anymore
about about what we discussed?

57
00:05:33,268 --> 00:05:35,161
"Thought any more,"
meaning reconsidered?

58
00:05:36,797 --> 00:05:38,253
So show me the flaw in it.

59
00:05:39,846 --> 00:05:41,131
"Flaws," Skyler.

60
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:43,654
"Flaws," plural, not singular.

61
00:05:46,815 --> 00:05:48,518
Where do you want me to start?

62
00:05:48,643 --> 00:05:50,920
I don't love
this situation, all right,

63
00:05:51,045 --> 00:05:52,359
that you put me in.

64
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:57,151
However, let's just stick
with what makes sense here.

65
00:05:58,382 --> 00:06:00,196
You took the seed money.
You went gambling.

66
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:03,032
You invested it in the car wash
that you helped run for four years.

67
00:06:03,361 --> 00:06:06,169
You hired your wife as a bookkeeper.
Because guess what?

68
00:06:06,294 --> 00:06:08,089
She's actually a bookkeeper.

69
00:06:08,214 --> 00:06:10,828
Now, that is a story an auditor can
believe, so what am I missing?

70
00:06:11,232 --> 00:06:14,343
You're missing that you should just
take this money that I give you

71
00:06:14,468 --> 00:06:15,946
and not look too closely at it,

72
00:06:16,621 --> 00:06:17,521
so

73
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:20,226
if, God forbid, I get caught,

74
00:06:21,234 --> 00:06:23,886
you maintain plausible deniability.

75
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:26,021
Okay, my estranged husband

76
00:06:26,581 --> 00:06:27,857
who, when he was working,

77
00:06:27,982 --> 00:06:29,930
made $43,000 a year,

78
00:06:30,184 --> 00:06:32,751
starts shoveling money at me,
and when the police come,

79
00:06:32,876 --> 00:06:34,518
I'm supposed to say, "Gee,

80
00:06:34,747 --> 00:06:36,899
"I never thought about it, Officers.
Made sense to me."

81
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:37,954
Really?

82
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,371
That, in your mind,
is plausible deniability?

83
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,439
I'll tell you what, Walt.

84
00:06:43,564 --> 00:06:46,776
I'd rather have them think
I'm Bonnie what's-her-name

85
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:48,282
than some complete idiot.

86
00:06:49,904 --> 00:06:51,544
So you're

87
00:06:52,423 --> 00:06:54,123
promoting caution here.

88
00:06:55,814 --> 00:06:58,262
And you want a believable story.

89
00:06:59,981 --> 00:07:02,158
That, it seems to me,

90
00:07:02,283 --> 00:07:03,860
is the safest way to make the best

91
00:07:03,985 --> 00:07:07,693
out of a very bad situation, yes.

92
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,597
But I'm noting

93
00:07:12,486 --> 00:07:14,480
a little hole in your plot, though.

94
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,974
Why would your estranged husband

95
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:19,438
be doing all this for you?

96
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:24,272
Because he loves his family

97
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:26,949
and desperately wants
a reconciliation,

98
00:07:27,074 --> 00:07:28,630
though it may be

99
00:07:28,755 --> 00:07:30,196
hopeless and futile.

100
00:07:31,312 --> 00:07:32,362
Then again,

101
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:34,484
he'd try anything.

102
00:07:39,065 --> 00:07:40,396
I'm just not buying it.

103
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:42,098
No, I think it would be better

104
00:07:42,223 --> 00:07:44,901
if the husband were
no longer estranged.

105
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,843
You know, maybe if he were back
sleeping in his own bed.

106
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:54,566
It's suddenly a fantasy story.

107
00:07:59,507 --> 00:08:02,360
I am at least going to be
a part of this household.

108
00:08:02,843 --> 00:08:04,720
Dinner with the family
every night of the week.

109
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:06,819
Not every night, no.

110
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:10,727
Six nights a week.
You'll get one night off.

111
00:08:10,852 --> 00:08:12,695
Dinner two nights, not weekends,

112
00:08:13,253 --> 00:08:14,701
with 24-hours' notice.

113
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,787
Five nights a week with no notice.

114
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:19,123
Three, six-hours' notice.

115
00:08:19,516 --> 00:08:21,537
Five nights a week
with two hours' notice.

116
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:22,572
Four.

117
00:08:22,697 --> 00:08:24,160
Don't push it.

118
00:08:27,234 --> 00:08:29,216
And I want my own key to the house.

119
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,048
For emergencies
and appearances, yes.

120
00:08:32,373 --> 00:08:34,150
I am going to babysit
my own daughter.

121
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:36,014
I'll help my son with his homework.

122
00:08:36,243 --> 00:08:38,183
I am going to be
a part of this family,

123
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:41,060
and that is how we'll sell
your little fiction.

124
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,067
How about we stop somewhere
afterward and get a beer?

125
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,125
No. Thanks, though.

126
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,809
Maybe some other time.

127
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:22,767
No, seriously.

128
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:25,285
Get a beer with me.

129
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:47,920
What?

130
00:09:56,624 --> 00:09:58,524
What the hell are you doing?

131
00:09:59,094 --> 00:10:00,514
That's ours, right?

132
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,320
Look at it and tell me
if that's ours.

133
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,028
Yes, it's ours.
Now put it away.

134
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:17,068
What the hell is wrong with you?

135
00:10:17,478 --> 00:10:19,576
Where did you get that?
Did you take it from the lab?

136
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:23,872
I bought it from the two guys
who killed Combo.

137
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:27,917
They had Combo shot down
in the street,

138
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:29,532
and now it's our product

139
00:10:29,856 --> 00:10:31,213
they're selling.

140
00:10:32,593 --> 00:10:35,175
Which means they work
for our guy. Right?

141
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:37,700
What is that?
That's hearsay.

142
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:40,829
- Do you have any proof?
- I heard it from the sister of the kid

143
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,557
who shot him.

144
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:46,207
Hear how I just said "kid"?

145
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,800
This kid...

146
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:50,618
he's 11 years old...

147
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:53,289
shot Combo on orders.

148
00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:58,094
These two scumbags,
they got him dealing.

149
00:10:58,219 --> 00:10:59,419
They got him...

150
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:01,952
And you know he's not the first.

151
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,143
They use kids 'cause, hey, why not?

152
00:11:05,904 --> 00:11:07,970
Easy to control, easy to fool.

153
00:11:08,095 --> 00:11:10,294
All they get is juvie
if they ever get caught.

154
00:11:10,498 --> 00:11:12,605
Hearts and minds, right?

155
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,023
Get them young,
and they're yours forever.

156
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:19,915
These guys killed Combo.

157
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:22,385
They used this little kid

158
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,349
like some puppet.

159
00:11:25,283 --> 00:11:28,925
They used him to shoot my friend.

160
00:11:35,622 --> 00:11:37,642
So why are you telling me this?

161
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:42,843
I need your help.

162
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:46,563
How?

163
00:11:46,817 --> 00:11:47,963
I need ricin.

164
00:11:48,088 --> 00:11:49,028
My God.

165
00:11:51,219 --> 00:11:52,515
God.

166
00:11:52,947 --> 00:11:54,049
These two...

167
00:11:55,705 --> 00:11:57,520
They got to go.
All right?

168
00:11:57,645 --> 00:11:59,522
I've got the entire
thing figured out...

169
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:02,624
a delivery method, everything.
All I need from you

170
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:05,156
is the poison, that's all.

171
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,342
Look,

172
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:10,176
otherwise, you don't have to...
lift a finger.

173
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:12,592
Listen, you don't even know
what you're talking about.

174
00:12:12,717 --> 00:12:14,638
Look, you
don't get how right this is?

175
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:18,676
You don't get how the whole
entire world

176
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:21,605
- would be better off...
- We're not even talking about this.

177
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,937
I know a woman

178
00:12:23,062 --> 00:12:25,356
who buys from the
these two once or twice a week.

179
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:28,547
She brings them hamburgers 'cause
they sit in their car all day,

180
00:12:28,672 --> 00:12:30,838
and they get hungry,
so she brings them food,

181
00:12:30,963 --> 00:12:32,788
and they knock
a few bucks off her price.

182
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,658
There's your delivery system
right there.

183
00:12:36,074 --> 00:12:38,119
- I can be a mile away.
- Jesus.

184
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,930
A meth-head
you're trusting to do this?

185
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,921
You know what? That meth-head
stood up to your brother-in-law.

186
00:12:44,686 --> 00:12:46,598
All right?
He questioned her for five hours.

187
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,471
She didn't give it up.

188
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,134
You know how it is you know?

189
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:51,941
Because you're not
in prison right now.

190
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,610
I know I would be
in prison after this.

191
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,951
Prison or worse, and I'd
be right alongside you.

192
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,016
You cannot be serious.

193
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,282
Listen, this is a ridiculous idea.

194
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,716
It's ridiculous?

195
00:13:05,841 --> 00:13:08,691
What, so you're saying
it's not going to work?

196
00:13:09,107 --> 00:13:11,694
How about back
when it was your plan?

197
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:14,208
Back when you were
going to use it on Tuco?

198
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,719
Apples and oranges.

199
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:18,968
Guy eats ricin. Two or three days later,
he gets the flu

200
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,550
or a heart attack or something,
and he keels over.

201
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:22,878
That's what you said.

202
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,653
Untraceable back to us.

203
00:13:25,617 --> 00:13:26,781
To me.

204
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:31,560
Not even that other scumbag we work for
is ever going to figure it out.

205
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:34,712
It was a good plan
back when it was Tuco,

206
00:13:34,837 --> 00:13:36,587
and it's a good plan now.

207
00:13:37,428 --> 00:13:39,651
Tuco wanted to murder us.

208
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:41,800
These guys don't.

209
00:13:42,997 --> 00:13:44,226
Apples and oranges.

210
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:45,928
Do I really have to sit here

211
00:13:46,053 --> 00:13:47,576
and explain the difference to you?

212
00:13:48,182 --> 00:13:49,254
Combo

213
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:50,338
was us,

214
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:51,838
man.

215
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,936
He was one of us.

216
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,043
Does that mean nothing?

217
00:13:56,241 --> 00:13:58,709
Why didn't you go after these guys

218
00:13:58,983 --> 00:14:01,372
- two or three months ago?
- Because I just found out about them.

219
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,736
What's to find out?

220
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,116
It's a dispute over turf, right?
how hard could it have been

221
00:14:07,508 --> 00:14:09,051
for you to track them down

222
00:14:09,485 --> 00:14:10,786
on their turf

223
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,031
and kill them months ago?

224
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,991
Because back then

225
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:18,571
you were too busy getting high,

226
00:14:18,696 --> 00:14:19,895
feeling sorry.

227
00:14:20,336 --> 00:14:21,336
Now,

228
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:23,566
murder...

229
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,849
is not part of your 12-step program.

230
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:31,158
This is not some amends
that you have to make.

231
00:14:31,283 --> 00:14:34,567
What you are talking
about here is pointless.

232
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:38,414
This achieves nothing.

233
00:14:38,775 --> 00:14:40,945
It accomplishes nothing.

234
00:14:46,433 --> 00:14:48,588
If you don't see
what it accomplishes,

235
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:52,297
then there's no way
I can explain it to you.

236
00:14:53,543 --> 00:14:55,060
Jesse, listen to me.

237
00:14:56,376 --> 00:14:58,208
You are not a murderer.

238
00:14:59,588 --> 00:15:01,713
I'm not, and you're not.

239
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:05,599
It's as simple as that.

240
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,084
I'm doing it...

241
00:15:16,523 --> 00:15:18,544
with or without you.

242
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:49,705
Knock, knock.

243
00:15:50,526 --> 00:15:53,076
Christ sakes, Marie,
you don't say "knock, knock." You...

244
00:15:53,397 --> 00:15:55,044
- Like that.
- Well, I like saying it.

245
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:56,830
That's not the rules.

246
00:15:57,867 --> 00:15:58,373


247
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,635
Listen, you knock your way, Groucho.
I'll knock mine.

248
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,544
But, look, see?
I win.

249
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:03,812
Not so fast.

250
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,882
Christ, again?
That's three in a row.

251
00:16:08,798 --> 00:16:10,803
Frickin' Paul Newman over here?

252
00:16:10,989 --> 00:16:12,512
Do you play cards with your dad?{\Have you been playing cards
with your dad?}

253
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:14,097
No, why?

254
00:16:15,731 --> 00:16:16,932
How is your old man?

255
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:20,003
- He back teaching?
- No,

256
00:16:20,128 --> 00:16:22,076
I don't think either
of them are working right...

257
00:16:22,611 --> 00:16:23,611
right now.

258
00:16:24,432 --> 00:16:25,844
How they swinging that?

259
00:16:27,271 --> 00:16:28,626
Did you know

260
00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:31,281
that the doctor has told your Uncle
Hank that he can get out of here

261
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:33,350
- any time he wants to.
- Yeah?

262
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,975
That's great.

263
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,988
Yeah, well,
we're not so sure about that.

264
00:16:37,113 --> 00:16:38,253
Why not?

265
00:16:39,216 --> 00:16:40,540
What? That's what they said.

266
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,188
That's what they said
because they want the room.

267
00:16:43,313 --> 00:16:45,302
They hit the sheets with Lysol,
re-set the meter,

268
00:16:45,427 --> 00:16:47,547
and wheel the next slob in here.
We went over this.

269
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,910
Drop it.

270
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:53,354
Are you not well enough?

271
00:16:54,832 --> 00:16:56,305
Jesus, kid, you, too?

272
00:16:56,737 --> 00:16:57,932
Do I look well enough?

273
00:16:58,445 --> 00:17:00,592
I'm shitting in pants,
peeing in pitchers.

274
00:17:01,374 --> 00:17:02,996
Can't move my legs.
Got it?

275
00:17:04,143 --> 00:17:07,149
So people in wheelchairs
should be in hospitals?

276
00:17:07,658 --> 00:17:09,611
What about people on crutches?

277
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,829
Maybe I should be in here, too.

278
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:15,726
- Is that what you're trying to say?
- Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying.

279
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:17,451
Deal, you little prick.

280
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:37,773
Bitch.

281
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:41,711
You know I'm hourly, right?

282
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,188
He promised me he'd be here.

283
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:49,112
Oh, he promised, huh?
Well, why didn't you tell me?

284
00:17:49,237 --> 00:17:50,587
Let's wait, then.

285
00:17:51,107 --> 00:17:52,904
That's a joke.
The kid ain't coming.

286
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,630
Okay, so what's Plan B?

287
00:17:56,183 --> 00:17:57,116
I don't know.

288
00:17:58,558 --> 00:17:59,575
I really don't.

289
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,103
Well, let's brainstorm.

290
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:05,122
- You really think he's serious?
- That's why I'm here, Saul.

291
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:08,310
The way he was talking,
he is going to do it.

292
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:10,412
Or try, at least.

293
00:18:10,843 --> 00:18:12,757
Okay, so, what, we pay him off.

294
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,528
No. No, it's not about money.

295
00:18:14,653 --> 00:18:16,552
It's about getting him
off the streets,

296
00:18:17,088 --> 00:18:18,805
getting him to calm down.

297
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,474
Maybe...

298
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:26,983
What if we...

299
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:29,027
maybe...

300
00:18:31,134 --> 00:18:33,111
Could you get him arrested?

301
00:18:36,035 --> 00:18:39,315
You want your criminal associate
taken into police custody?

302
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,442
No, now, listen.

303
00:18:41,132 --> 00:18:43,121
I know it sounds risky,
but it wouldn't be anything

304
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,983
that would get him into real trouble

305
00:18:45,108 --> 00:18:47,074
and nothing that could lead
back to our business.

306
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:48,932
Just some minor offense.

307
00:18:50,627 --> 00:18:52,213
Pinkman in jail... I don't know.

308
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:54,380
- I'm picturing it and...
- No, not in jail

309
00:18:54,505 --> 00:18:55,505
as in...

310
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:57,379
"jail" jail.

311
00:18:58,782 --> 00:19:00,637
I'm talking about one of those

312
00:19:00,762 --> 00:19:03,727
situations where you're
in an orange jumpsuit

313
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,685
picking up litter along the highway.

314
00:19:06,487 --> 00:19:07,629
That's jail.

315
00:19:09,603 --> 00:19:11,608
You're talking
about a level-two joint.

316
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,254
Something that keeps him off
the street for, say,

317
00:19:14,379 --> 00:19:16,601
30 days.
Then by the time he gets out,

318
00:19:16,726 --> 00:19:19,491
tempers have cooled
and hopefully we can move on.

319
00:19:20,843 --> 00:19:23,303
Roswell Correctional's
pretty low impact.

320
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:26,981
In the past
I've recommended Springer, but

321
00:19:27,106 --> 00:19:29,524
hearing chancy things
about their bathrooms

322
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:31,503
since they renovated,

323
00:19:32,565 --> 00:19:33,369
so...

324
00:19:34,126 --> 00:19:36,090
So it's possible, right?

325
00:19:37,546 --> 00:19:40,359
It falls under
my premium-services package,

326
00:19:40,484 --> 00:19:42,013
but you can afford that.

327
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:43,935
I'll call my P.I.

328
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:51,350
You understand what you have to do?

329
00:19:54,883 --> 00:19:56,075
You can

330
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,410
never talk to anyone.

331
00:19:57,952 --> 00:19:59,072
Right?

332
00:20:00,891 --> 00:20:03,459
I mean, ever.
Understand?

333
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:04,977
Yeah.

334
00:20:09,914 --> 00:20:11,870
I found this stuff on the Internet.

335
00:20:12,701 --> 00:20:14,207
Takes days to kick in.

336
00:20:14,934 --> 00:20:17,602
Just keep quiet,
and this won't ever come back to you.

337
00:20:20,322 --> 00:20:22,216
You're okay with this, right?

338
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:27,599
Just think of it like
it's the same thing as always.

339
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:29,910
You're just delivering
some hamburgers.

340
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:35,314
It's not just delivering hamburgers.

341
00:20:38,129 --> 00:20:39,579
You got a kid.

342
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:40,874
Right?

343
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:42,887
What's his name?

344
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,422
Patrick.

345
00:20:45,263 --> 00:20:46,873
Imagine these two guys

346
00:20:46,998 --> 00:20:48,965
and Patrick working as a mule,

347
00:20:49,857 --> 00:20:51,367
making him kill people.

348
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:54,710
Wouldn't you do anything
to protect your kid?

349
00:20:55,497 --> 00:20:56,568
Of course I would.

350
00:20:56,693 --> 00:20:58,304
I do all kinds of things for him.

351
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,160
Okay, so...

352
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:06,958
these guys using kids like that,

353
00:21:08,694 --> 00:21:09,941
they got to go.

354
00:21:10,534 --> 00:21:11,326
Right?

355
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,151
Good.

356
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,176
Tomorrow.

357
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:30,919
I'll be in touch.

358
00:21:52,673 --> 00:21:54,445
Bet that tastes good, huh?

359
00:22:02,691 --> 00:22:03,691
Come here.

360
00:22:07,051 --> 00:22:08,243
Here we go.

361
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,645
Here we go.

362
00:22:23,138 --> 00:22:24,364
What are you doing?

363
00:22:24,489 --> 00:22:26,400
If you need to talk, use the phone.

364
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:28,357
This isn't a phone talk, Walter.

365
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:31,449
Your wife's out, right?

366
00:22:35,907 --> 00:22:37,313
Isn't she something?

367
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,442
I got a granddaughter
a few years older.

368
00:22:40,545 --> 00:22:42,145
What can I do for you?

369
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:45,961
Have a seat, Walter.

370
00:22:48,916 --> 00:22:52,490
I spoke to Goodman about Pinkman
and this plan of yours.

371
00:22:57,273 --> 00:22:59,171
- And?
- I'm not going to do it.

372
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:00,668
Why?

373
00:23:00,793 --> 00:23:02,343
Because it's moronic.

374
00:23:03,894 --> 00:23:06,241
Saul said you've done things
like this before.

375
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,106
That's not the moronic part.

376
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:10,078
Okay, so what's the problem?

377
00:23:10,537 --> 00:23:12,865
The problem is
the boss wouldn't like it.

378
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:16,561
Saul?

379
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:20,289
My boss.

380
00:23:21,877 --> 00:23:22,859
Your boss.

381
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:28,196
This is a professional courtesy.

382
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:30,689
No one knows I'm here.
Understand?

383
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,056
But our employer would
find out, like always,

384
00:23:35,002 --> 00:23:38,037
and if Pinkman were arrested,
he'd take it as a problem.

385
00:23:42,322 --> 00:23:44,870
You got a good thing going here.
We all do.

386
00:23:45,748 --> 00:23:48,198
You want to risk it all
on one junkie?

387
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:50,565
Now, I realize you two
have a history,

388
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,689
but this kid's been
on the bubble a while now.

389
00:23:53,343 --> 00:23:54,995
It's a long time coming.

390
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:58,936
What is?

391
00:24:04,354 --> 00:24:06,419
I used to be a beat cop,
long time ago,

392
00:24:07,764 --> 00:24:10,321
and I'd get called out on
domestic disputes all the time.

393
00:24:10,446 --> 00:24:12,178
Hundreds, probably, over the years.

394
00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:16,945
But there was this one guy, this one
piece of shit that I will never forget.

395
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,345
Gordie.

396
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,049
He looked like Bo Svenson.
You remember him?

397
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,057
<i>Walking Tall</i>?
You don't remember?

398
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:25,963
Anyway...

399
00:24:26,201 --> 00:24:27,345
big boy...

400
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:29,032
270, 280,

401
00:24:29,817 --> 00:24:30,817
but his wife...

402
00:24:31,907 --> 00:24:33,825
or whatever she was... his lady

403
00:24:34,247 --> 00:24:35,389
was real small,

404
00:24:36,337 --> 00:24:39,064
like a bird,
wrists like little branches.

405
00:24:41,392 --> 00:24:44,606
Anyway, my partner and I get
called out there every weekend,

406
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,954
and one of us would pull her
aside and we'd say,

407
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:49,397
"Come on, tonight's the night
we press charges."

408
00:24:50,515 --> 00:24:53,281
And this wasn't one of those "deep
down he really loves me" set-ups.

409
00:24:53,406 --> 00:24:55,468
We got a lot of those, but not this.

410
00:24:55,593 --> 00:24:57,087
This girl was scared.

411
00:24:57,212 --> 00:24:59,718
She wasn't going to cross him
no way, no how.

412
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:03,124
Nothing we could do
but pass her off to the Emts,

413
00:25:03,249 --> 00:25:05,145
put him in the car,
drive him downtown,

414
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,073
throw him in the drunk tank.

415
00:25:07,198 --> 00:25:09,844
He sleeps it off.
Next morning, out he goes...

416
00:25:10,295 --> 00:25:11,300
back home.

417
00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:14,265
But one night

418
00:25:16,189 --> 00:25:17,656
my partner's out sick,

419
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:18,953
and it's just me.

420
00:25:19,682 --> 00:25:22,158
And the call comes in,
and it's the usual crap...

421
00:25:22,353 --> 00:25:24,304
broken-nose-in-the-shower
kind of thing.

422
00:25:25,186 --> 00:25:27,859
So I cuff him, put him in the car,
and away we go.

423
00:25:29,156 --> 00:25:30,556
Only that night...

424
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,955
we're driving into town,

425
00:25:34,526 --> 00:25:36,024
and this sideways asshole

426
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:38,984
is in my back seat
humming "Danny Boy."

427
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,297
And it just rubbed me wrong.

428
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,634
So instead of left,

429
00:25:45,968 --> 00:25:47,649
I go right, out into nowhere.

430
00:25:48,735 --> 00:25:51,903
And I kneel him down,
and I put my revolver in his mouth,

431
00:25:52,825 --> 00:25:54,049
and I told him,

432
00:25:54,861 --> 00:25:55,877
"This is it.

433
00:25:56,385 --> 00:25:57,935
This is how it ends."

434
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:02,150
And he's crying,
going to the bathroom all over himself,

435
00:26:02,275 --> 00:26:04,829
swearing to God
he's going to leave her alone,

436
00:26:04,954 --> 00:26:06,111
screaming...

437
00:26:06,547 --> 00:26:08,857
as much as you can
with a gun in your mouth.

438
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,910
And I told him to be quiet...

439
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:15,767
'cause I need to think about
what I was gong to do here.

440
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,940
And of course he got quiet.

441
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,253
Goes still.

442
00:26:21,418 --> 00:26:22,828
And real quiet.

443
00:26:24,497 --> 00:26:26,698
Like a dog waiting
for dinner scraps.

444
00:26:28,347 --> 00:26:30,563
Then we just stood there
for a while.

445
00:26:32,218 --> 00:26:34,425
Me acting
like I'm thinking things over,

446
00:26:35,532 --> 00:26:37,541
and Prince Charming
kneeling in the dirt

447
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:39,296
with shit in his pants.

448
00:26:42,448 --> 00:26:45,061
And after a few minutes I took
the gun out of his mouth,

449
00:26:46,845 --> 00:26:50,447
and I say, "So help me,
if you ever touch her again,

450
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,401
"I will such and such
and such and such

451
00:26:53,526 --> 00:26:55,071
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

452
00:27:00,445 --> 00:27:01,695
Just a warning?

453
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,451
Of course.

454
00:27:09,652 --> 00:27:11,905
Just trying to do the right thing.

455
00:27:15,336 --> 00:27:17,469
But two weeks later he killed her.

456
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:19,512
Of course.

457
00:27:22,078 --> 00:27:24,826
Caved her head in with the
base of a Waring blender.

458
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:30,829
We got there, there was so much
blood, you could taste the metal.

459
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:37,527
The moral of the story is...

460
00:27:39,605 --> 00:27:41,137
I chose a half measure

461
00:27:42,714 --> 00:27:44,989
when I should have gone all the way.

462
00:27:50,122 --> 00:27:52,367
I'll never make that mistake again.

463
00:28:02,027 --> 00:28:04,115
No more half measures, Walter.

464
00:28:21,135 --> 00:28:22,832
Man, I don't get this.

465
00:28:23,373 --> 00:28:25,051
I don't get this at all.

466
00:28:25,176 --> 00:28:27,038
All I'm seeing is the kid.

467
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:30,015
So where are they?

468
00:28:30,783 --> 00:28:32,225
I don't know.

469
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,753
They're always around.

470
00:28:34,466 --> 00:28:36,216
Burgers are getting cold.

471
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:42,267
So is it, like, fast?

472
00:28:45,797 --> 00:28:48,523
Don't sweat it, all right?
You're just doing what you do.

473
00:28:48,648 --> 00:28:50,102
Nobody's going to know anything.

474
00:28:52,844 --> 00:28:54,315
Can I have another bump?

475
00:28:54,469 --> 00:28:55,882
You had your bump.

476
00:28:56,007 --> 00:28:58,441
We get this thing done.
Then you can have all you want.

477
00:28:59,353 --> 00:29:01,030
Going to need you to come with me.

478
00:29:02,186 --> 00:29:03,317
Take a walk.

479
00:29:42,646 --> 00:29:44,088
Where are we going?

480
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,319
Sit down.

481
00:31:30,361 --> 00:31:32,944
I understand that you have a
problem with two of my employees.

482
00:31:34,563 --> 00:31:36,876
It is true that they killed
one of your associates.

483
00:31:38,053 --> 00:31:40,356
It is possible they acted rashly,

484
00:31:41,098 --> 00:31:42,942
but, on the other hand,
there was provocation.

485
00:31:44,189 --> 00:31:45,781
A man was selling
on their territory.

486
00:31:48,794 --> 00:31:51,075
There is blame on both sides.

487
00:31:56,397 --> 00:31:58,040
This will go no further.

488
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,543
It will be settled right here,

489
00:32:00,971 --> 00:32:01,992
right now.

490
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:04,881
You told him.

491
00:32:09,684 --> 00:32:11,095
Wait outside.

492
00:32:22,343 --> 00:32:23,482
Listen to me.

493
00:32:23,793 --> 00:32:25,317
You have one friend in this room.

494
00:32:25,587 --> 00:32:26,652
This man.

495
00:32:29,095 --> 00:32:30,445
Those men outside

496
00:32:30,702 --> 00:32:32,902
are my trusted employees,

497
00:32:33,724 --> 00:32:36,775
and when I learned
what you intended to do...

498
00:32:39,663 --> 00:32:41,407
If it wasn't for this man

499
00:32:41,532 --> 00:32:43,542
and the respect I have for him,

500
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:46,279
I would be dealing with this
in a very different way.

501
00:32:47,556 --> 00:32:50,050
You don't look at him.
You look at me.

502
00:32:56,492 --> 00:32:58,242
This is what happens now.

503
00:32:58,557 --> 00:33:00,526
My men will come back inside,

504
00:33:00,651 --> 00:33:03,105
and you will shake their hands

505
00:33:03,454 --> 00:33:05,097
and you will make peace.

506
00:33:05,222 --> 00:33:07,422
And that will be the end of this.

507
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
Pardon me?

508
00:33:18,073 --> 00:33:19,747
They use kids.

509
00:33:20,104 --> 00:33:22,289
These assholes of yours,
they got an 11-year-old kid

510
00:33:22,414 --> 00:33:24,183
doing their killing for them.

511
00:33:24,308 --> 00:33:27,129
You're supposed to be some kind
of reasonable businessman.

512
00:33:27,412 --> 00:33:29,162
This how you do business?

513
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,358
You okay with this?

514
00:33:32,483 --> 00:33:34,433
You got anything to say here?

515
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:50,466
Bring them back.

516
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:16,642
No more children.

517
00:34:19,697 --> 00:34:20,765
Understand?

518
00:34:23,731 --> 00:34:24,731
And you.

519
00:34:29,472 --> 00:34:30,922
You keep the peace.

520
00:34:36,205 --> 00:34:37,205
Say it.

521
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:42,038
I'll keep the peace.

522
00:34:46,145 --> 00:34:47,292
Shake hands.

523
00:35:31,468 --> 00:35:33,123
Jesse, your actions...

524
00:35:35,806 --> 00:35:37,301
they affect other people.

525
00:35:40,811 --> 00:35:42,281
And sometimes

526
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,038
compromises have to be made...

527
00:35:48,185 --> 00:35:49,885
for the best of reasons.

528
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:28,084
Let the people who get
paid to do this, do this.

529
00:36:28,893 --> 00:36:31,755
The people who get paid to
do this, do a lousy job.

530
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:46,752
So I guess this is
what you want, huh?

531
00:36:46,877 --> 00:36:49,031
Just lying in a hospital bed,

532
00:36:49,623 --> 00:36:51,816
getting sponge baths from nurses.

533
00:36:56,308 --> 00:36:57,863
It's time to go home, Hank.

534
00:36:57,988 --> 00:37:00,460
How many times I got to tell you?
Not till I'm well.

535
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,011
Hey, what are you doing?

536
00:37:11,136 --> 00:37:12,354
I'm just seeing.

537
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,840
Seeing what?

538
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,321
Seeing what I see.

539
00:37:17,746 --> 00:37:19,278
I'm not at my best here, Marie.

540
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:20,594
We'll see.

541
00:37:22,212 --> 00:37:24,012
Nothing's going to happen.

542
00:37:24,341 --> 00:37:25,242
I say it will.

543
00:37:27,151 --> 00:37:29,101
I'm in this bed for a reason.

544
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,640
It's a waste of time.

545
00:37:35,259 --> 00:37:37,066
Besides, what if someone comes in?

546
00:37:37,552 --> 00:37:38,932
Let them. I don't care.

547
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:40,757
What's wrong with you?

548
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,742
I'll tell you what.

549
00:37:43,867 --> 00:37:46,430
If I can get the groundhog
to see his shadow...

550
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,868
- It's not going to happen. I'm sorry.
- I'm betting it will, and if he does,

551
00:37:50,374 --> 00:37:51,974
you check out of here.

552
00:37:54,196 --> 00:37:56,607
I'm not going to bet
on whether I get a boner.

553
00:37:57,117 --> 00:37:59,002
It's not bet.
There's no bet here. No bet.

554
00:37:59,127 --> 00:38:00,292
You afraid you'll lose?

555
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:02,279
You know what?
You're just...

556
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,296
You're just being foolish, you know?

557
00:38:04,421 --> 00:38:05,421
Come on.

558
00:38:06,087 --> 00:38:07,437
What's the point?

559
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:09,005
The point is...

560
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,954
you're not completely hopeless.

561
00:38:14,998 --> 00:38:16,067
We have a bet?

562
00:38:18,035 --> 00:38:19,235
You know what?

563
00:38:19,636 --> 00:38:21,639
If it'll get you
out of here quicker,

564
00:38:22,206 --> 00:38:24,036
- you got one minute.
- One minute?

565
00:38:24,161 --> 00:38:25,677
All right.
That's a cakewalk.

566
00:38:26,031 --> 00:38:27,491
Yeah, this is just...

567
00:38:28,145 --> 00:38:29,838
It's just sad.
I mean...

568
00:38:30,287 --> 00:38:32,258
I really feel sorry for
you, Marie, you know?

569
00:38:32,383 --> 00:38:34,151
I really do.
It's just... It's...

570
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:36,495
pathetic.

571
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,130
That's okay.
Keep talking.

572
00:38:38,255 --> 00:38:39,255
Protest.

573
00:38:39,803 --> 00:38:41,023
Struggle.

574
00:38:42,793 --> 00:38:45,246
Marie, give up.
I mean, seriously, it's...

575
00:38:46,563 --> 00:38:47,355
not...

576
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:50,577
going to happen.

577
00:39:15,526 --> 00:39:16,526
Bad day?

578
00:39:19,863 --> 00:39:21,263
I don't even know.

579
00:39:25,726 --> 00:39:27,523
Anyway,

580
00:39:27,648 --> 00:39:29,071
it's better now.

581
00:39:36,982 --> 00:39:38,582
Tell them you're busy.

582
00:39:41,652 --> 00:39:42,754
Hello.

583
00:39:44,087 --> 00:39:45,087
Grandma?

584
00:39:46,223 --> 00:39:47,759
Slow down.

585
00:39:48,377 --> 00:39:49,877
Slow down. I can't...

586
00:39:52,196 --> 00:39:52,988
God.

587
00:39:55,029 --> 00:39:55,821
God.

588
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:31,461
Tomas!

589
00:40:34,771 --> 00:40:37,618
You have to let me in!
Please!

590
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,392
<i>Hey, it's me.
Wait for the thing.</i>

591
00:40:52,439 --> 00:40:55,127
You are now 42 minutes late.

592
00:40:57,342 --> 00:40:59,079
I'm starting without you.

593
00:41:03,384 --> 00:41:05,928
- <i>What is wasabi?</i>
- <i>Wasabi. Right you are.</i>

594
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:07,587
<i>"Four-letter Word" for 1,200.</i>

595
00:41:08,347 --> 00:41:10,884
<i>Pilots and musicians
know this word...</i>

596
00:41:11,308 --> 00:41:13,069
Dinner's almost ready, okay?

597
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:16,508
- <i>What is "solo"?</i>
- <i>That's the word.</i>

598
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:17,807
This guy is good.

599
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:20,133
- <i>"Four-letter Word," 2,000.</i>
- <i>"A loud"...</i>

600
00:41:20,755 --> 00:41:23,939
<i>harsh cry.
Walt Whitman's was "barbaric".</i>

601
00:41:24,254 --> 00:41:26,054
- Yell.
- What is "yawp"?

602
00:41:26,431 --> 00:41:27,750
- <i>Kevin.</i>
- <i>What is "yawp"?</i>

603
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:29,585
- <i>"Yawp."</i>
- <i>"Tokyo," 1,200.</i>

604
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,189
What the heck's a "yawp"?

605
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,580
"Yawp" is a yell.
I'll be right back.

606
00:41:37,618 --> 00:41:39,266
That's what I said.

607
00:41:55,973 --> 00:41:58,338
<i>Hey, it's me.
Wait for the thing.</i>

608
00:42:10,251 --> 00:42:12,318
<i>Hey, it's me.
Wait for the thing.</i>

609
00:42:14,472 --> 00:42:16,462
Look, I hope you're not waiting
for an apology,

610
00:42:16,587 --> 00:42:18,534
because I did not rat you out.

611
00:42:19,865 --> 00:42:22,638
I was looking out for your best
interest as well as my own,

612
00:42:22,763 --> 00:42:25,488
and I stand by my decision 100%,

613
00:42:25,613 --> 00:42:28,301
so we'll just have to agree
to disagree.

614
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:33,210
Anyway, just call me back.

615
00:42:36,953 --> 00:42:38,587
So the TV turns itself off?

616
00:42:38,712 --> 00:42:39,837
I'll get it.

617
00:42:45,423 --> 00:42:46,717
Where's the remote?

618
00:42:46,842 --> 00:42:49,499
<i>On the murder of a young boy
in the South Valley.</i>

619
00:42:49,845 --> 00:42:51,740
<i>Police have yet to release
a statement,</i>

620
00:42:51,865 --> 00:42:54,804
<i>but sources indicate
that 11-year-old Tomas Cantillo</i>

621
00:42:55,245 --> 00:42:58,307
<i>may have been the victim
of a gang-related execution.</i>

622
00:42:58,432 --> 00:43:01,207
<i>An anonymous tip brought police
to a playground</i>

623
00:43:01,332 --> 00:43:03,997
<i>on the 4700 block
of 8th Avenue late last night.</i>

624
00:43:04,944 --> 00:43:08,494
<i>Paramedics were called to the scene
but were unable to revive the boy.</i>

625
00:43:09,007 --> 00:43:10,227
<i>A gruesome crime...</i>

626
00:43:10,352 --> 00:43:11,854
Can you turn that off?

627
00:43:11,979 --> 00:43:14,007
<i>And yet another casualty
in what appears to be</i>

628
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:17,970
<i>the city's ongoing struggle against
drugs and the gangs that peddle them.</i>

629
00:43:18,848 --> 00:43:20,948
<i>We'll be passing along detail...</i>

630
00:43:26,835 --> 00:43:28,101
Give me your dad...

631
00:43:29,388 --> 00:43:31,030
I'm sorry. It's just,

632
00:43:31,155 --> 00:43:33,318
they've been talking about
that all day, and it's just...

633
00:43:39,885 --> 00:43:41,583
Did you know your dad and I

634
00:43:42,361 --> 00:43:44,591
are thinking about maybe
starting a business together?

635
00:43:45,488 --> 00:43:46,652
Seriously?

636
00:43:48,101 --> 00:43:50,626
- What kind of business?
- I don't know.

637
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:52,495
We're thinking maybe a car wash.

638
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,507
What do you mean?
Like...

639
00:43:57,388 --> 00:43:59,111
I'm sorry.
I... I have to go.

640
00:46:57,904 --> 00:46:58,731
Run.
