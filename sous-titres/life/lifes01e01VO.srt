00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,390
*******

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,240
********

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,430
After the trial,I had to get
counseling just so I could sleep.

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,280
There was all that proof.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,470
We all turned our back on charlie crews.

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,190
In his first years,

8
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:22,070
Office Robert Stark Former Partner of Charlie Crews 
he was in that prison hospital more-- 
more than he was out.

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,120
Cop doing time,please.

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,950
Broke nearly every bone in his body.

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,920
I heard they cut him real bad too.

12
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,560
Over 100 stitches.

13
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,330
Dr.Alan Fay Pelican Bay Surgeon 
About 241 stitches.

14
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,950
I mean,the jury was
only out for an hour.

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,300
There was all that proof.

16
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,200
After the case was
reopened,we found that

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,040
none of the physical evidence
on scene matched officer crews.

18
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,560
I wasn't the only one.

19
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,510
We all thought he was guilty.

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,260
did charlie tell you he didn't do it?

21
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,840
Jennifer Conover Ex-Wife of Charlie Crews 
yes.

22
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,220
Jennifer Conover Ex-Wife of Charlie Crews 
and how did you feel when you found out 
he was being exonerated?

23
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,680
that he was innocent?

24
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,190
I don't wanna do this anymore.

25
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,930
Constance Griffiths Attorney for Charlie Crews 
As I said at the press conference after 
detective crews was exonerated,

26
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,210
Constance Griffiths Attorney for Charlie Crews
life was his sentence,
and life is what he got back.

00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:27,310

Los Angeles Four Months Later 
detective crews!

31
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,540
you are detective crews,aren't you?

32
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,140
Yeah.

33
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,870
I guess I am.

34
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,350
Okay,well,would you like to be sure?

35
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,720
Because we're about to
walk into a crime scene.

36
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,920
I'm sure.

37
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,880
Great.

38
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,910
Are you reese?

39
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,580
Detective reese.

40
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,420
10-4.

41
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,050
Crews,it's a kid in there.

42
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,730
It's your first day back.

43
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,510
If you don't think you can
handle it,I can do it myself.

44
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,910
Small caliber,close range.

45
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,390
probably not a lot of noise.

46
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,030
No one reported hearing anything.

47
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,010
The bullet was a through and through.

48
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,150
Is that the kid's dog?

49
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,570
Yeah,he won't move.

50
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,740
did you find the slug?

51
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,820
no,ma'am.

52
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,220
did you look for it?

53
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,110
Yes,detective. we looked for it.

54
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,450
Did you ask the dog?

55
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,210
did we ask the dog?

56
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,530
we did not ask the dog,no.

57
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,840
no,sir. we did not ask the dog.

58
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,960
Hey.

59
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,930
Hey.Hey.

60
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,720
Good boy.

61
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,370
There's a bullet here beneath the skin.

62
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,110
Dog must have caught the bullet
in the gut after it exited the kid.

63
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,080
all right,get the dog to a vet.

64
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,450
get the bullet out and to ballistics.

65
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,650
What are you doing way over here?

66
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,470
get me animal reg to my location.

67
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,460
did you bring something over?

68
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,850
Your master's over there.

69
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,830
Did you bring something over?

70
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,260
detective crews.

71
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,440
detective!

72
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,210
hey,hold on.

73
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,380
- that looks like a--
is that a finger? - Yeah.

74
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,910
Dog must have took a bullet for the kid,

75
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,190
then took the shooter's finger off.

76
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,270
Anyone ever love you that much?

79
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,870
If I got out after all that
time,I got all that money,

80
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,140
Office Krebbs and Zerco LAPD Current 
I sure as would not be going back to work.

81
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,000
Now I handle his settlement money.

82
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,520
Ted Earley Financial Advisor to Charlie Crews 
and how much would that be?

83
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,740
Ted Earley Financial Advisor to Charlie Crews 
that's undisclosed by court order.

84
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,640
and what about details
of the settlement?

85
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,990
I'm not at liberty to say.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,800
Yeah,I-I heard he got $5
million. Can-- can I say?

87
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,120
5? I heard it was 50.

88
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,010
So you wanna have the talk?

89
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,910
Which talk is that?

90
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,420
About how you didn't
want me as your partner,

91
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,190
and you're looking to transfer
out as soon as you can.

92
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,670
Nope. I don't wanna have that talk.

93
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,540
You wanna have the
talk about what you did?

94
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,260
Who you pissed off to
get partnered up with me?

95
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,410
I was handed a slip of paper.

96
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,440
it said you're my new partner.

97
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,920
It didn't mention why,and I didn't ask.

98
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,210
Getting stuck with me isn't
exactly a promotion for you.

99
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,660
Detective,it might be a habit of yours,but I don't
wanna have the "what are you in for" talk either.

100
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,910
Not a big talker.

101
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,340
See,I've learned something
about you already.

102
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,290
John was not my biological son.

103
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,400
He was alyssa's from her first marriage.

104
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,450
We have another one
of our own,a daughter.

105
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,230
You adopted john?

106
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,590
Yeah,I always think of him as my own.

107
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,270
As a member of the family.

108
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,310
I thought of--
thought of him as.

109
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,340
Where is john's biological father?

110
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,650
Jail.

111
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,160
He's,uh.

112
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,610
Possession with intent to distribute.

113
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,670
He's got ten more years.

114
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:22,340
The-- the scout
troop that john is a--

115
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:28,650
was a part of is made up entirely of
boys who have fathers who are doing time.

116
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,290
all right,we're almost through.

117
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,310
you reported a break-in last month?

118
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,810
Yeah,um.

119
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,830
Some cash and jewelry was
taken. No one was caught.

120
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,130
We changed the locks and the
alarms. Makes me paranoid.

121
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,980
- I-- what?I don't
understand. - Pot.

122
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,450
Just makes me,you
know,overprocess everything.

123
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,130
I end up spinning
myself into a freak-out.

124
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,430
you get high today,warren? yeah?

125
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,350
it's sunday. a little wake and bake?

126
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,110
because in the next few hours,there's gonna be all kinds
of law enforcement crawling all over your beautiful house.

127
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,730
- Detective. 
- they turn up a
bag of high-grade chronic,well,

128
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,900
- I think you need to be herefor your family - 
- detective.

129
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,040
- and you do not- 
- detective!

130
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,660
- May I speak with you?
- Sure thing.

131
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,300
Why don't you go to the bathroom?

132
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,290
When you're done,make sure
you flush real well. okay?

133
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,820
you know,maybe flush
twice. you understand?

134
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,610
Excuse me.

135
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,250
What the hell was that?

136
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,170
What,you wanna see the dead boy's dad
get locked up for holding a little hay?

137
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,730
Stepdad,and a possible suspect
in a murder-- in a child murder.

138
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,470
That man didn't kill
anyone,and you know it.

139
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,910
He's got all his fingers,and
he seemed really sad.

140
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,220
You just broke the law.

141
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,440
I am your superior detective.

142
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,720
I'm responsible for your actions.

143
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,880
If you get jammed up for
this,I get jammed up for this.

144
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,280
Hey,we're both adults here.

145
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,670
You got a problem,turn
me over to the rat squad.

146
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,860
Are you gonna get that?

147
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,970
A phone this small in your
pocket. It's science fiction,right?

148
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,000
This living
in the future--

149
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,370
- was john having trouble in school?
- no.

150
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,770
- in the neighborhood?
- no.

151
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,110
other kids in the scout troop?

152
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,300
what about the break-in?

153
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,730
He was with me when that happened.

154
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,410
John had nothing to do with that.

155
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,720
I wasn't suggesting that,ma'am.

156
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,390
No,I'm sorry.

157
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,420
of course you weren't.

158
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,720
we're gonna need to ask you a few
questions about your ex-husband mark.

159
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,860
Mark wasn't a bad man
when I married him.

160
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,130
He had a problem with drugs.

161
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,190
But when he came out of jail
the first time,he'd changed.

162
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,070
He was mean.

163
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,380
when he went back in,I
knew I had to get away.

164
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,390
so you just dumped the
divorce papers in the mail.

165
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,890
What did you just say?

166
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,690
What'd you just say?

167
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,510
What?

168
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,300
What did I just say?

169
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,980
two of the other dads in the scout troop
have records of violence against children,

170
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,000
but both those dads are in jail.

171
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,490
I'm gonna call in,see if they got
a hit off that finger we found.

172
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,210
It was pretty chewed up,but.

173
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,280
Okay,okay.

174
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,200
- you're mad at me.
- mad?No,I'm not mad.

175
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,830
I mean,I don't even think
there is a word for what I am.

176
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,550
What you did to that
husband,I kinda get,okay?

177
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,920
I mean,I guess I kind of get,but
what you said to that wife--

178
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,920
I know.that one was me.

179
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,490
it was my fault. I take
responsibility,reese.

180
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,920
I wasn't in the moment.

181
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,570
If I had stayed in the moment,if I had stayed
present,I would have been okay,but I didn't.

182
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,060
I was thinking about
where we're going next.

183
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,400
So I left the moment just when I should
have been completely in the moment,

184
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,310
which is when people usually leave the moment
because the moment is just too much for her.

185
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,950
I mean,the moment is pretty
much always too much,you know?

186
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,110
I was thinking about
where we're going next.

187
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,450
Must feel good to come in
without a cavity search.

188
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,050
right,detective?

189
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,430
Course,you want one for old times'
sake,we could work something out.

190
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,320
Just take us to rawls,okay?

191
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,800
Sure thing,sweetheart.

192
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,740
MAXIMUM SECURITY FACILITY

193
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,600
They won't let me go to his funeral.

194
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,930
My own son's funeral.

195
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,570
Mr.Rawls,I'd like for you to
think and see f you can help us.

196
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,100
They won't let me go
to my son's funeral.

197
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,400
Why don't you help me?

198
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,570
You do not raise your voice to her.

199
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,920
I want to do more than
raise my voice to her.

200
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,870
You gonna stop me?

201
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,460
Do you hate cops?

202
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,970
Oh,yeah.

203
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,460
Well,I hate cops too.

204
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,310
Mr.Rawls,have you made any enemies here in
prison that would want to hurt your family?

205
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,700
Get back at you by killing your son?

206
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,200
yeah,I got enemies.

207
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,840
but none that would touch my son.

208
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,870
Why is that?

209
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,370
Because everyone's got family.

210
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,690
That's right.

211
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,450
Everyone.

212
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,620
mr.Rawls,you last saw john two
weeks ago when the scout troop came.

213
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,880
how did he seem to you? was
he in any kind of trouble?

214
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:37,600
Last time I saw john,he kept saying
how he thought I shouldn't be here.

215
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,200
It's like he needed to believe it.

216
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,660
No threats against his family.

217
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,760
Not that we know,but we just work here.

218
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,930
We go home after our shifts.

219
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,160
It's the convicts who are here
24/7 that know what really goes on.

220
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,190
He means inmates.

221
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,300
He means convicts.

222
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,680
What? you don't like that word?

223
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,420
What do you care?

224
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,100
Come on,crews. let's go.

225
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,620
Yeah,we know who you are.

226
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,310
We know you did your 12 years.

227
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,840
Maybe you were innocent. maybe not.

228
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,300
It don't make no difference to us because we know what
you did to that correctional officer up in pelican bay,

229
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,130
and that makes you a con. Don't it?

230
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,100
You two need to escort us out now.

231
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,090
You getting angry,convict?

232
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,250
Anger ruins joy,steals
the goodness of my mind,

233
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,430
forces my mouth to say terrible things.

234
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,010
Overcoming anger brings peace of
mind,leads to a mind without regrets.

235
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,390
If I overcome anger,I will be
delightful and loved by everyone.

236
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,070
Are you making fun of us?

237
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,090
It is the universe that
makes fun of us all.

238
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,810
Why exactly would the
universe make fun of us all?

239
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,640
Maybe it's insecure.

240
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,020
to detach your feelings from the event.

241
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,360
to detach your feelings from the object.

242
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,700
I am not attached to this car.

243
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,100
I am not attached to this car.

244
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,420
I'm just a little attached to this car.

245
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,220
so what is it this time?

246
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,890
License and registration.

247
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,060
You know damn well who I am.

248
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,050
License and registration,please.

249
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,890
Look,I married your
ex-wife. That is not a crime.

250
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,720
Are you aware that you changed
lanes back there without signaling?

251
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,330
you have nothing better to do?

252
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,410
no,sir. Not at this moment.

253
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,680
********,okay,tyler?

254
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:05,530
yes,ma'am.

255
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,460
some of the other boys said that you
and john were close,is that right?

256
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,950
Yeah. I suppose.

257
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,890
Tyler,lift your head up when you speak.

258
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,390
Ah,mushy.

259
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,280
Did john ever talk to you about
any problems he was having?

260
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,990
Were there any new people in his life?

261
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,780
No,ma'am.

262
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,050
That's the one. Green anjou.

263
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,150
You know,some people
are allergic to pears.

264
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,780
Gives them a rash. not me though.

265
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,830
Tyler.

266
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,380
was john in any sort of trouble?

267
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,230
don't lie to this woman,tyler.

268
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,020
I'm not lying.

269
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,630
Reese,I guess what I wanna say
is you've probably had to fight,

270
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,340
being a woman in this department.
had to fight a lot,right?

271
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,670
fight for everything you ever got?

272
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,540
detective crews,this is not
the place for that discussion.

273
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,520
Detective crews!

274
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,710
- I just wanted
to s- - crews.

275
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,220
- I just wanted to let
you know that- - step back.

276
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,730
- You don't have to fight with me.
- Step back.

277
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,440
She thinks I'm gonna hug her.

278
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,730
You think I'm gonna hug you.

279
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,160
as I hug my partner I know she is real.

280
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:06,380
I mindfully meet this person
with open arms and an open heart.

281
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,220
I'm not gonna fight with you,I won't.

282
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,620
You don't wanna hold it
in anymore,do you,tyler?

283
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,360
What you know about
what happened to john.

284
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,980
Something's inside you,but
you wanna let it out.

285
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,770
You don't wanna hold it in any
longer. You can't hold it in.

286
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,320
What is it,tyler?

287
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,120
Some man-- some man offered to sell
john information about his dad's case.

288
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,080
about a technicality in the arrest.

289
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,320
he said that he could
get his dad out of jail.

290
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,700
Who was it?

291
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,420
I don't know.

292
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,380
- tell them who this man was!
- I don't know!

293
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,590
We met him online.

294
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,310
He sent john an I.M.

295
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,550
I don't know who he really is.

296
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,330
An I.M. he sent john an
I.M.He sent john an I.M.

297
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,970
oh,my god!

298
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,310
why would you talk to some man online?

299
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,140
Well,he knew all about his dad's
case. He said he was a lawyer.

300
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,080
John believed him?

301
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:16,420
He said if john paid,he'd get
stuff to show it was a bad arrest.

302
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:19,590
he just wanted to get his dad out.

303
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,320
john just wanted to get his dad
out of jail,and now he's dead.

304
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,710
I should have told somebody.

305
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,110
If I had told somebody,maybe.

306
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,390
Come here.

307
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,620
Reese,what exactly is an I.M.

308
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,750
What is it? an email?

309
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,600
is that detective charlie crews?

310
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,170
you know,I thought it was you,but I was kinda
blinded by the glint off that detective badge.

311
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,700
Dani reese,bobby stark.

312
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,960
No. are you charlie's new partner?

313
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,550
We got something in common.

314
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,590
Oh,yeah. And what would that be?

315
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,660
Bobby and I used to be partners.

316
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,930
Juarez,you see what a
big shot my ex-partner is?

317
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,870
Hey,can I get a picture? huh?

318
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,700
You know,on account of you being
a celebrity detective and all.

319
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,250
That's a phone,bobby.

320
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,180
It's got a camera in
there. where you been?

321
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:23,280
Me? Been in federal
maximum security prison.

322
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,340
Come here.

323
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,160
Charlie crews.

324
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,650
Does it bother you that he
spent all that time in the joint?

325
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,360
And what does that do to a guy's head?

326
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:36,420
I'm just saying,you sure he's gonna
be there when you go through a door?

327
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:40,850
Does it bother you that your pal stark let
his partner go down for a crime he didn't do?

328
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,000
I mean,I'm just saying.

329
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,290
Do I feel bad about what happened?

330
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,090
Yeah,I feel bad.

331
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,420
Do I feel guilty? no.

332
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,250
'Cause I did my job.

333
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,180
There's an investigation,and
then there's a trial.

334
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,490
That's the way it works.

335
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,330
You wanted to see me?

336
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,220
Yeah,your parents missed you last night at the
wednesday night dinner,dani,you should come back.

337
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,350
Oh,maybe my mom did,but I don't
think my dad missed me much.

338
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,920
He's not so bad.

339
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,840
I sat in a car with your dad for
three years,and I came out alive.

340
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,140
Partners aren't parents,lieutenant.

341
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,500
So. You've been working
the program,dani?

342
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,520
Is this where I pee in a cup?

343
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,230
No,this is where you tell me if
you've been working the program.

344
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,940
Yeah.

345
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,160
I've been working the program.

346
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,120
Good.

347
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,820
It was a tough draw
getting a new partner.

348
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,530
I'm just a lucky girl,I guess.

349
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,420
Dani,you know why you got crews.

350
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,330
Because I messed up.

351
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,810
You know,I'm at the bottom of
the list,and there's not a--

352
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,220
there's not a whole
lot I can do about that.

353
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,680
What if there was something
you could do about it?

354
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,480
How come we're talking about this?

355
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,080
Why did he come back to the force?

356
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,550
That's not my job to ask,l.T.

357
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,900
Crews is gonna be trouble.

358
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,550
He got screwed. he's back to get even.

359
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,290
- He's a cop.
- Because of his settlement.

360
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,700
You're a cop because of your work.

361
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:10,620
You know,I was wondering who
it would be,who they would send.

362
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:13,110
And I just kept thinking

363
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,910
"oh,you're being paranoid about this."

364
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,070
remember how paranoid
I used to get,l.T.?

365
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,160
You don't have to go
to prison to eat crap.

366
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,500
I eat it every day of my career.

367
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,270
it would be nice if you could keep
your head down and work the job.

368
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,540
The world isn't nice like that.

369
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,530
This could be good for you,dani.

370
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,770
You're his superior,and you're responsible
for his supervision and actions.

371
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,170
he gets jammed up,I get jammed up?

372
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:40,030
Has he done anything that would
cause him to be removed from duty?

373
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,540
He alerted a suspect that a
police search was about to happen.

374
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,410
And detective crews apparently.

375
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,970
Allowed the suspect to dispose
of a quantity of marijuana,

376
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,350
to flush it down the toilet
just prior to the search.

377
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,430
How long have you lived here?

378
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,460
Four months.

379
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,440
When is all your furniture coming?

380
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,140
This is all my furniture.

381
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,710
hey,charlie!

382
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,850
- charlie,I need you to sign something.
- Not now,ted.

383
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,870
I need you to sign this. look,hey.

384
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,940
You were the one that said
you wanted this orange grove.

385
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,400
if you changed your mind,I would
be happy to unwind the deal,

386
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,560
- my friend-
- ted,not now.

387
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,480
I'm,uh,I'm--
I'm meditating.

388
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,420
Well,that sounds. Peaceful.

389
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,800
Uh,all right. I'm...

390
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,750
Hey,ted,the orange grove deal
includes the tractor,right?

391
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,040
The big red one?

392
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,530
Yeah,charlie,it includes
the big red tractor.

393
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,830
Who's that?

394
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,170
Do you read forbes?

395
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,260
I wasn't very good at prison.

396
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,330
Ted Earley Ex-CEO,Attercliffe Capital
you were in for a white-collar crime?

397
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,450
Ted Earley Ex-CEO,Attercliffe Capital 
insider trading.yeah.

398
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:18,670
Charlie saved my life in there,and
so now I handle his settlement money.

399
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,940
and you live in his garage?

400
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,140
I live in a room above his garage.

401
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,710
Do you wanna know my name?

402
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,730
If I wanted to know your name,I
would have asked you for it.

403
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,130
So that means you're not gonna call?

404
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,580
I can't call if I don't
know your name,now,can I?

405
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,640
I.M. Stands for instant message.

406
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,440
I know that.

407
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,570
You can't trace an I.M.

408
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,750
Detective,I know that too.

409
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,340
You know we have to see her.

410
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,500
- Because it went so well last time?
- I'll be better this time.

411
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,350
- you're not gonna talk this time.
- That's what I mean by better.

412
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,360
Look,I know the deal with your
ex-wife,all right,it's no secret.

413
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,130
so just tell me that we're gonna go
see alyssa gibney because of the case,

414
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,900
and not because of something
that you're working through.

415
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,650
I'm workg thinugh the case.

416
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,370
She doesn't want to see you.

417
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,500
Uh,does she want to see anybody?

418
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,690
She won't come downstairs.

419
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,080
She won't look at her daughter
or talk to her husband.

420
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,240
I'll tell her you tried to stop us.

421
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,070
my husband told me about you.

422
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,810
A cop in jail all those years.

423
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,670
How did you go on living?

424
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:48,160
How did you get past it?

425
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,730
Well,I could tell you
you're already past it.

426
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,810
I could tell you this
moment is your life.

427
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,450
I could tell you you have a
husband and child who need you.

428
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,400
None of that means anything,does it?

429
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,780
So tell me something
that means something.

430
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,330
Tell me anything that means something.

431
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:23,070
The man who killed your
son is out there. Right now.

432
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,030
Inside this same moment we are in.

433
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,870
As we sit here,as I look at you,

434
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,530
the man who killed john is free.

435
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,640
Now that means something,doesn't it?

436
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,610
we're pretty sure someone was
running a scam on your son,alyssa,

437
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,670
offering to sell him information
about his father's arrest.

438
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,890
about a technicality that could
get his father out of jail.

439
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,290
that's ridiculous. mark is guilty.

440
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,080
John knew that.

441
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,130
Even mark will tell you he's guilty.

442
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:00,860
And if there was a technicality,why
go with it to a child?

443
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,120
Because my son.

444
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,450
- A child- -
would believe it.

445
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,760
Because a child would wanna
believe he could get his father out.

446
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,230
- Because a child- -
would pay to believe it.

447
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,620
We need to know,alyssa.

448
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,420
John stole that money,didn't he?

449
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,430
Yes.

450
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:31,520
I lied to my husband when I
said that john was with me.

451
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,850
I lied for him because I loved him.

452
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:40,550
He'd been through so much those
early years with mark.And I--

453
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,710
he's in the same moment that we're in.

454
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,100
The man who killed my son.

455
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,830
Will you go get him,please?

456
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,670
Yeah.

457
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,370
Uh,it's for you.

458
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,760
Hello?

459
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,220
charlie?

460
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,560
you're aware this isn't my phone?

461
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:20,140
When you answer your phone,I'll
call you on your phone.

462
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,560
I need to see you.

463
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,150
I'm fighting crime.

464
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,440
Come over tonight. I'll buy fruit.

465
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,310
I don't exactly understand you.

466
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,470
You don't have to
understand here to be here.

467
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,300
That's what I don't understand.

468
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,620
What was crews like before?

469
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,420
Basic by-the-book
cop. you know.

470
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:46,110
Looking for his 20 and his pension.

471
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,210
Why? what's he like now?

472
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,090
You wanna find out about
somebody,all you have to do is google.

473
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,520
I google myself all the time.

474
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,050
Google the kid's dad,mark rawls.

475
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,910
well,that's more than enough
to work a scam on a kid.

476
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,580
google me.

477
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,420
You want to see me?

478
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,330
You don't wanna see that,charlie.

479
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,670
Do it. Do it.

480
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:41,800
GOT FRAMED?

481
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,440
12 years for a crime he did not commit

482
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,910
your father's been calling me.

483
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,130
twice today.

484
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,260
Three times yesterday.

485
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,260
Do you want some melon?

486
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,150
It's very fresh and juicy.

487
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,710
Are you not talking about this?

488
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,110
I'd ask you to address all
your questions to my lawyer.

489
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,360
I am your lawyer.

490
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,970
- Your father is getting married.
- No.

491
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,560
he's getting remarried.

492
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,770
He wants you to come.

493
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,090
His bride to be is eight years old.

494
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,610
Either way. I don't have a date.

495
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:30,800
From what I hear,you
have plenty of dates.

496
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,710
Charlie. Please call your father.

497
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,290
If only so he will stop calling me.

498
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:44,550
My father is getting remarried to an
eight-year-old because my mother is dead.

499
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,810
My mother is dead because he killed her.

500
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,980
He killed her when he
wouldn't let her come see me.

501
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,600
No zen for daddy?

502
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,780
No zen for daddy.

503
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,180
Hey.

504
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,790
- where'd you go?
- I'm still here.

505
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:17,520
Do you ever think that no one
will ever understand what we did?

506
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,890
What you and I came through?

507
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,140
Do you ever think that the world is now you
and me in one place, everyone else in another?

508
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,370
Sorry.I'm sorry. that's stupid.

509
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,030
I think that all the time.

510
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,600
It's late.

511
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,430
I should go.

512
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,250
Yeah.

513
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,200
I'm not attached to this car.

514
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,430
I am not attached to this car.

515
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,330
call from dani reese.

516
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,510
- hello?
- hello.

517
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,460
crews,you there?

518
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,300
reese? am I talking to you?

519
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,600
what do you mean are you talking
to me? you're talkin' to me.

520
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,720
- But how am I talking to you?
- crews!

521
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,230
we got a hit off the finger you dug up.

522
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,680
A junkie named lonnie garth.

523
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:35,050
He's got no known address,but he hangs
out at those crack houses downtown.

524
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,440
I'm sending you his mug shot right now.

525
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,020
To my house?

526
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,330
to your phone.

527
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,000
- it's like- -
living in the future?

528
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:52,930
actually,I thought about that,and it turns
out there really is no future or past either.

529
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,900
just
now.and n--

530
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,440
and of course now.

531
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,540
Reese?

532
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,990
Reese?

533
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,620
all units.All units. suspect
located at 5th and main.

534
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,380
all units. All units.

535
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,750
why'd you become a cop again?

536
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:15,910
When I was doing all that time,I always
thought,inside me I'm still a cop.

537
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,490
It's what I held on to.

538
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,710
Wow,that sounds like a lot of crap.

539
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,560
A lot of life is a lot of crap.

540
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,160
This is
command--

541
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,960
well,if I'm in all those years,I'm
just thinking about one thing.

542
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,180
Was I set up for that murder?

543
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,360
- Is that what you'd be thinking?
- Yeah.

544
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,450
That and what I'd do once I
found the guys that set me up.

545
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,780
- You ever think about any of that?
- Nope.

546
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,580
I'm thinking about finding
a nine-fingered crackhead.

547
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,990
I can see you,devils!

548
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,770
I know you come to get me
for what happened to that kid.

549
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,760
lonnie garth?

550
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,240
Devils know my name.

551
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,500
You need to come out here,so
we can arrest you for murder.

552
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:04,420
I never ever killed
that kid! arthur did!

553
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,870
arthur killed that kid!

554
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,850
- good morning!
- good morning.

555
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,620
did you just wake up?

556
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,890
that arthur,he just wanted the money,but
the kid,he wouldn't give it to him.

557
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,120
he just started
yelling,so arthur shot him!

558
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:25,660
and his dog wouldn't stop yelling
at me,and it took my finger!

559
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,040
arthur just wanted the money!

560
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,580
arthur have a last name?

561
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,560
arthur killed that kid!

562
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:37,040
but I watched-- I watched arthur
kill that kid,and I didn't stop him!

563
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:40,560
I watched arthur kill that
kid,and I didn't stop him!

564
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,990
I've been waiting for you!

565
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,350
reese?

566
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,190
I'm okay!I'm okay. I'm not shot.

567
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,030
uh,I'm goin' now.

568
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,890
I'm going--
I'm going now.

569
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,850
I never ever killed that kid.

570
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,460
I'm going. I'm going now.

571
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,770
it was just a bad dream.

572
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,890
Go back to sleep.

573
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,380
Reese?

574
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,330
Reese!

575
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,130
Oh,god. get it off me.Drugs.

576
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,710
Oh,god. help me.

577
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,690
Please,please,please,turn the water on.

578
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,790
Turn the damn water on!

579
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,400
Crews!

580
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:38,800
Yeah.

581
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,030
Hey,you wanna talk about
what happened back there?

582
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,880
The drugs? the shower?

583
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,100
Well. We don't have to talk about it.

584
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,990
We never have to talk about it.

585
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,500
you know,he said he
never killed that kid.

586
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,680
do we believe that?

587
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,960
he seem like the kinda guy who
could run a complicated I.M.Scam?

588
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:19,650
No,he didn't.

589
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,920
He said a guy named
arthur killed the kid.

590
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:27,240
Okay,so then how would arthur get
a hold of john gibney's screen name?

591
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:30,200
There's a directory for the
parents in the scout troop.

592
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,930
Let's go see if there are
any parents named arthur.

593
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:38,120
Arthur tins,a dad in the scout troop,served
two years for credit card scams,

594
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,710
paroled six months ago.

595
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,200
Hey,arthur.

596
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,830
- How you doin'?
- Good.

597
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,020
Why would you show me that?

598
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,930
Does it make you uncomfortable?

599
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,700
No,it makes me sad. I
have a child of my own.

600
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,060
Wait,I know that boy.

601
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,700
He's in my son's troop.

602
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:09,290
- His name is,um,john something.
- John gibney.

603
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,850
- yeah.
- yeah.

604
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,230
say his name.

605
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,320
No,I don't think I'll do that.

606
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:19,940
Next time I ask,you will.

607
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,250
john figured out you were full of crap.

608
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,410
you had nothing to free his dad,

609
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,050
but he wouldn't tell you where
the money was,so you killed him.

610
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,220
By now you've searched my
house,my office,and my computer.

611
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:35,160
and I know that you have found
nothing at my house,in my office.

612
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,440
or on my computer. Aren't you that
cop that spent all that time in jail?

613
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,920
That must have sucked.

614
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,810
Lonnie garth said you
killed that kid,arthur.

615
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,670
You kinda lost it when
he wouldn't pay up.

616
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,030
lonnie garth the dead crackhead?
you're going to court with that?

617
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,450
We're curious about the phone calls
between your client and lonnie garth.

618
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,050
What's it like being famous?

619
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:02,940
a record of those phone calls
proves nothing. we are done here.

620
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,850
maybe he can explain
the calls,maybe he can't.

621
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,450
The fact remains that your client has
been communicating with a known felon.

622
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,090
A parole violation?

623
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,130
that's what you bring to
me? a parole violation?

624
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,740
What does that carry,like,a
year? I do that in my sleep.

625
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,790
A year for killing a kid.

626
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,960
I need a drink.

627
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,010
I know something better.

628
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,930
Mango?

629
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,740
It's okay.

630
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:42,520
This came all the way from guatemala,and
now it's right here in this cup.

631
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,110
It's all connected,reese.

632
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,460
What is?

633
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,590
it is.

634
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,340
- that's zen.
- is it?

635
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,350
- that's zen too,isn't it?
- is it?

636
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,700
Say "is it" one more
time,and I'll shoot you.

637
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,090
Don't you two ever give up?

638
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,270
Hey,detective reese,isn't
that mark rawls over there?

639
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,700
I think you're right,detective crews.

640
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:20,040
hey,uh,you know mark
rawls,don't you,arthur?

641
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,870
you told his son you could get him out
of jail,then you broke his son's heart.

642
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,310
Then you killed him.

643
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,620
I'm gonna need protective lockup.

644
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,340
For a parole violation?

645
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,710
- you're only here for a year.
- You can do that in your sleep.

646
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,740
Send me somewhere now,and
I'll-- and I'll-- and I'll talk.

647
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:40,770
Start talkin' now.

648
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,430
I killed the kid.

649
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:46,530
arthur.say his name.

650
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,410
John gibney. I killed john gibney.

651
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,710
What was that,arthur? I didn't catch it.

652
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,930
John gibney. I killed john gibney.

653
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,170
Why?

654
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,530
Because he saw my face.

655
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,810
Lonnie always got the money,but the kid wouldn't
give it to him,so lonnie brought the kid to me.

656
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,760
And john wouldn't give
you the money either.

657
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,220
Let's go.

658
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,050
Lonnie was supposed to get the money. He
wasn't supposed to see me.he saw my face.

659
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,920
It is all connected.

660
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:37,860
I thought you'd want to know the department is
prepared to go ahead with the complaint against crews.

661
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,430
What complaint is that?

662
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,880
That you saw him allow a suspect to flush
a controlled substance down the toilet.

663
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,560
But I didn't see that.

664
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,730
I said that he apparently flushed those
drugs because I did not see that happen.

665
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,100
I mean,I don't know
exactly what happened.

666
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:56,640
I'm not sure I understand you,dani.

667
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,820
You don't have to
understand here to be here.

668
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:04,570
Is this a problem for you because
of your own history with drugs?

669
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,510
- I went to rehab for that.
- Yeah.

670
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,680
I've been clean for 21 months.

671
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:12,900
Even with rehab,the department
doesn't have to keep you on the job.

672
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:16,360
You didn't get a settlement,dani.

673
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,600
So the next time crews does something.

674
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,420
I need to make sure I do see it.

675
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,160
Life was his sentence,and
life is what he got back.

676
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,680
what do you think he
should do with that life?

677
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,430
that would be up to him.

678
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,330
FOLLOW THE MONEY

679
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:42,890
COMPROMISED DNA

680
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,900
40K IN WIFE'S ACCOUNT

681
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,640
MISSING

682
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:12,750
HE COULD NOT HAVE SEEN

683
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:43,530
you wanna drive the tractor.

684
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,690
You know,I,uh.

685
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,280
I sorta do.

00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,260
- Hey,ted.
- Yeah.

687
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,550
Exactly where are the oranges?

688
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:10,210

Oh,god,that's bad. I'm sorry.

696
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,930
Oh,god. I'm very sorry,charlie.
