2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,220
we are nowhere.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,180
We are nowhere.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,620
We are nowhere.

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,290
You can't be nowhere...

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,210
- because to be...
- crews.

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,410
- You have to be...
- crews.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,560
Somewhere.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,740
You can't be nowhere.

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,300
We are nowhere...

11
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,430
with the shooting,your shooting.

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,530
- Ballistics?
- Clean.

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,850
Whoever did it was in the car
by the time I got to the door.

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,560
What about the car?

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,800
Stolen.

16
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,370
Found it wiped clean.

17
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,010
Crews,you were looking...
right at whoever did it.

18
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,380
You can't remember?

19
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,140
Okay,you answered the door...

20
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,000
and then?

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,810
And then I got shot.

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,560
What about the person with the gun?

23
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,290
Nothing.

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,550
Really? I thought there
couldn't be nothing.

25
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,060
You want to come in?

26
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,820
<i>Eight Weeks Later</i>

27
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,450
here you are.

28
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,250
Here you are.

29
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,910
It's an unusual request,detective.

30
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,900
Most people wouldn't want to
have the bullet that shot them.

31
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,310
Well,someone gave it to me.

32
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,750
It'd be rude just to throw it away.

33
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,790
- You fit for duty?
- I am fit for duty.

34
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,930
You want to go catch a killer?

35
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,880
I thought you'd never ask.

36
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,890
how come this is lapd and not faa?

37
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,670
I guess this is why.

38
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,200
Think he shot himself?

39
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,900
If he did,why'd he land the plane?

40
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,170
Why didn't he just let go?

43
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,170
No gun anywhere in here.

44
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,230
Pilot's license I.D.'S
him as william ellis.

45
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,150
The late william ellis has one
entry wound to his right side.

46
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,110
Got a bunch of witnesses out
here. They all say the same thing.

47
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,720
The plane makes a hard
landing. They run up.

48
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,250
The pilot's all alone in the plane.

49
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,580
He looks at them and dies.

50
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,550
- There's no one else in the plane.
- And no gun.

51
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,090
So someone shoots him
before he takes off?

52
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,830
Or someone shoots him in the air.

53
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,120
And jumps?

54
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,850
Or william ellis here shoots
himself and then tosses the gun out.

55
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,190
I'll call the airfield,check if
he was alone when he took off.

56
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,260
I'll see if the faa has a flight
path,find out where he was going.

57
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,660
Hey,reese?

58
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,140
He look familiar to you?

59
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,160
Yeah,but I can't figure out why.

60
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,510
William ellis-- guess
where he used to work.

61
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,670
- In the circus.
- No.

62
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,010
Why would you say the circus?

63
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,720
You told me to guess.

64
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,340
- Crews.
- I'll tell you.

65
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,480
In space. William "bull"
ellis was a shuttle pilot.

66
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,830
He went up there three times.

67
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,540
Ellis retires from nasa in 1993.

68
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,620
He starts a company that makes parts
for rocket engines,and he gets rich.

69
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,620
- He came down in that plane alone?
- Yep.

70
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,810
The field where he took off from
was private. No control tower.

71
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,680
He logged out alone,but there
was no one there to verify that.

72
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,610
Where was he headed?

73
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,290
Flight wasn't logged in. The faa
doesn't track planes that small.

74
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,040
I know him. He looks familiar.

75
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,720
He's been on the news.

76
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,550
He's going back into space.

77
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,180
He was gonna pay the russians
$35 million to take him back up.

78
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,500
$35 million. Okay.

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,850
A rich man gets shot dead. Who benefits?

80
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,650
Uh,he's got a wife that died
ten years ago and,uh,one kid.

81
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,880
We're on our way now to go talk to him.

82
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,780
Detective,a moment.

83
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,400
Not you,detective. You,detective.

84
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,940
Don't you usually kiss reese
when you call her back like this?

85
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,210
I got something else in mind for you.

86
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't remember who shot you?

87
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,670
Just a blank space there.

88
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,260
Okay,just so you know,I don't buy it.

89
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,250
Someone shoots me,that's
not someone I'm gonna forget.

90
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,430
Well... like I
said,captain,there--

91
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,220
there's just a blank space there.

92
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,970
Dad called this morning.

93
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,490
Said he was taking the
plane up for a couple hours

94
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,490
and wanted to see me in the
office when he came down.

95
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,090
You work for your father,dean?

96
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,420
Yeah,the head of expended
resource control and distribution.

97
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,120
Can you think of anybody
who'd want to harm him?

98
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,710
harm him? No. Everybody loved him.

99
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,890
The president called,said the
nation had lost a shining light.

100
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,210
Dean,we need to ask you
where you were this morning.

101
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,950
With some friends here at work.

102
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,660
You... you want to talk to them?

103
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,350
Oh,it's just procedure.

104
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,040
He goes back into space at his
age--that doesn't worry you at all?

105
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,530
Dad needed to fly.

106
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,960
Hours alone in his
plane,climbed k2 last year.

107
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,510
If dad wanted to go back into
space,dad was going back into space.

108
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,550
Pretty expensive trip,huh?

109
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,140
$35 million.

110
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,560
Did he have that kind of money?

111
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,280
Dad was selling the company to
pay for his next trip up there.

112
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,890
Selling it for how much?

113
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,970
A lot,I guess.

114
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,750
william ellis spends 15 years
building up this company,

115
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,300
and then he sells it
for two weeks in space?

116
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,910
He had been up there before.

117
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,860
He knew what he was paying for.

118
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,920
I guess he thought it was worth it.

119
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,410
Could you imagine seeing
the world from up the?

120
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,530
The earth is floating.

121
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,290
You are floating.
Everything is floating.

122
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,840
I hear there's a lot of barfing
and you crap into a vacuum.

123
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,110
Yeah,a floating vacuum.

124
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,460
A floating vacuum?

125
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,930
You don't even know what that means.

126
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,950
It's space talk.

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,920
We joined nasa together,trained
together,flew together.

128
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,530
We retired within months of each other.

129
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,060
When bill opened up this shop...

130
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,190
I came on board.

131
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,410
As an employee?

132
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,730
You're checking up on
me. Yes,as an employee.

133
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,950
Mr. Breem,bill ellis was
selling this business.

134
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,400
What's that leave you with?

135
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,670
That leaves me with having worked
for bill ellis for the last 15 years.

136
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:31,100
That leaves me with time to get
back in the cockpit where I belong.

137
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,540
I never wanted to be a
businessman. I'm--I'm a flyer.

138
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,400
So you worked for him because...

139
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,990
Because bull asked me to.

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,390
Did bull have any enemies?

141
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,990
No,no. Everyone loved bull.

142
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,690
The president called this morning.

143
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,740
Is it possible he took his own life?

144
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,400
We all get a little
depressed at this age.

145
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,070
One foot in the grave,another
on a banana peel.

146
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,430
But to be honest with you,for
folks like us,it's worse.

147
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,700
To be down here and not up there?

148
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,480
That's exactly right.

149
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,160
But bill was going back. He...

150
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,710
he was going back up.

151
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,330
What's it like? To be up there?

152
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,030
It's like...

153
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,860
like going back where I came from.

154
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:23,480
"Like going back where I came from."

155
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,040
A lot of the astronauts turn to poetry.

156
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,100
The spacemen poets.

157
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,310
We're gonna have to ask--
where were you this morning?

158
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,130
I was fishing at castaic.

159
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,910
Detectives,you will find
out who did this,won't you?

160
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,180
Mr. Breem,how much was bill
ellis selling his company for?

161
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,880
$30 million.

162
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,700
The trip back up costs $35 million.
Where was the rest coming from?

163
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,750
His savings.

164
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,660
How much of his savings?

165
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,420
Well,all of it.

166
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,820
Can you point us toward
his son dean's office?

167
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,600
he pays for that trip,the
kid gets no inheritance.

168
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,130
How come everyone says
the president called?

169
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,460
Well,people like to think that they
will be remembered after they're gone.

170
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,340
You know,that their
lives have made an impact.

171
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,500
After I got shot,you
thought about me,didn't you?

172
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,650
Come on. You did,admit it.

173
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,270
Y-ye--yes,crews,I
thought about you.

174
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:29,970
About what it would be like
if I,you know,floated away,

175
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,150
how empty your life would be.

176
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,940
Reese with no crews.

177
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,940
Hey,when I was unconscious...

178
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,650
The,uh... the president
didn't call me,did he?

179
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,120
No. He didn't call.

180
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,420
You'd tell me if he did,though.

181
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,310
I mean,you'd--you'd make
sure I got that message?

182
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,150
model planes.

183
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,200
you were flying model planes yesterday?

184
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,920
We're a club.

185
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,300
And where do you fly these planes?

186
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,620
desert.

187
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,170
Wind currents are primo.

188
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,690
I have a fokker.

189
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,810
Excuse me?

190
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,000
A fokker.

191
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,230
It's vintage. It's
what the red baron flew.

192
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,500
A model of what the red baron flew.

193
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,990
you're all out there together?

194
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,350
we meet once a week.

195
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,320
Once a week.

196
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,920
Or when the currents are primo.

197
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,840
And what do you fly?

198
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,460
Sr-71 blackbird.

199
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,320
That alibi seem rehearsed to you?

200
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,390
Dean's dad flew rockets.

201
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,930
Dean flies model airplanes.

202
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,230
His dad knew the president.

203
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,130
He knows them.

204
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,770
His dad owns this company,but...

205
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,760
makes dean work in that closet.

206
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,360
His dad sells the company...

207
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,750
and dean is left with nothing.

208
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,740
Was there something else?

209
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,090
Dean said his job is expended
resource control and distribution.

210
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,870
Can you tell us what that means?

211
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,800
Waste removal.

212
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,020
His father made him
take out the garbage.

213
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,230
paid him minimum wage too.

214
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,680
Said he had to start at the bottom.

215
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,220
Dean's father flew high.

216
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,650
I guess dean gets high too.

217
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,200
How's your injury?

218
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,760
100%. Why?

219
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,270
You want to kick in a door?

220
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,060
What the hell is it?

221
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,360
I have no idea.

222
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,720
You ever seen anything like it?

223
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,000
Nope. You?

224
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,400
Nope. You?

225
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,390
Nope.

226
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,820
What'd those kids say?

227
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,320
Nothing without a lawyer.

228
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,610
Maybe dean's father caught
dean dealing,so dean killed him.

229
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,400
Dealing,but... dealing what?

230
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,840
I've never seen anything like it.

231
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,190
Reese,remember those
guys who came to buy?

232
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,950
What did they have in comn?

233
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,380
They drove nice cars.

234
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,530
No. They drove race cars.

235
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,890
Not sure I'd go and do that.

236
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,920
Race cars.

237
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,600
Anyone got a light?

238
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:43,020
Not sure if I'd go and do that either.

239
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,280
Dean worked at a rocket plant.

240
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,610
all right,let's talk about
scarcity of resources.

241
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,770
The less there is of
something,the more it is worth.

242
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,270
Like innocent men in here.

243
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,300
No,baby.

244
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,940
We're all innocent in here.

245
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,750
Actually,I am innocent this time.

246
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,360
Last time I-I did it.

247
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,060
I did what they said.
But,uh,this time,uh...

248
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,200
I am innocent.

249
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,240
Then you're the scarce resource.

250
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,770
Charlie crews says
hang tough,mr. Earley.

251
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,040
It won't be much longer.

252
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,150
Solid rocket fuel.

253
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,750
No wonder our hazmat
guy couldn't I.D.It.

254
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,180
You need security clearance to
get your hands on that stuff.

255
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,790
Or a dad in the business.

256
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,730
Those street racers
put this in there cars--

257
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,520
man,oh,man,are they
going somewhere fast,huh?

258
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,150
Your dad flew jets in the navy?

259
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,510
Carrier landings at night.

260
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,060
Takes a real man to do that.

261
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,870
Flew those three shuttle missions too.

262
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,690
I looked it up and--oh,wait,maybe
you know this too.

263
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,140
How fast your dad was
going when he flew up there.

264
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,250
17,000 miles per hour.

265
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,740
Did you hear that,reese?

266
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:17,100
Bill ellis was flying through
space at 17,000 miles per hour.

267
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:21,120
Your dad's a spaceman,and there
you are with your toy airplanes.

268
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,060
Model.

269
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,530
Okay,toy model.

270
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,570
And taking the company trash out,stealing
your father's fuel-- that make you popular?

271
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,550
- It make you cool?
- Make you money,dean?

272
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,520
Bull ellis find out you
were ripping him off?

273
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,130
Is that what he wanted
to talk to you about?

274
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,500
We're pretty sure you were not flying
model airplanes when your dad got shot,dean.

275
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,780
I was selling fuel in pomona.

276
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,880
Had breakfast at the diner. Flirted
with the waitress. She'll remember.

277
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,230
Oh,it went that well,huh?

278
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,890
Not very smart still working this
with us cops snooping around,dean.

279
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,090
Biggest race of the year.

280
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,980
I had obligations. I
didn't kill my father.

281
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,760
If you didn't do it,who did?

282
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,650
Don't you want to know who did it,dean?

283
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,670
His fly buddy mick breem wants to know. We
want to know. The president wants to know.

284
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,270
But you,dean,how--how come
you don't want to know?

285
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:11,310
Or are you not asking
who it is because...

286
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,160
you know who it was?

287
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,710
Who killed your father,dean?

288
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,210
Since last year,he,uh...

289
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,670
he spent too much time
alone in his plane.

290
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,990
He loved that company,and
he was selling it.

291
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,240
To go back into space.

292
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,620
What was he gonna do up there?

293
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,240
You didn't think he was coming back?

294
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,040
My partner here thinks
he took his own life.

295
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,240
Is that what you think?

296
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,970
Did he ever talk to you about this?

297
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,350
Dad never spoke to me about himself.

298
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,320
Never spoke to me.

299
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,670
Like a man?

300
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,120
Because you didn't fly.

301
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,540
I'm afraid of heights.

302
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,420
Dean said his father changed
his behavior about a year ago.

303
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,570
Something happen then?

304
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,410
Bill ellis was a hero.

305
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,130
It's our job to find
mr. Ellis' killer...

306
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,040
even if the killer is mr. Ellis himself.

307
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,930
Now,did something happen a year ago?

308
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,940
K2.

309
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:46,400
Bill climbed
regularly,several peaks a year.

310
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,330
Last year he ascended k2.

311
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,300
When he came back,he had changed.

312
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,590
Something happen on that mountain?

313
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,490
I don't know.

314
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,560
But he came back down off that mountain,put
that pick up on that shelf there.

315
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,680
He never climbed again.

316
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,910
What is that?

317
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,500
You don't know what this is?

318
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,540
This is a buddhist mourning flag.

319
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,510
It's got some english writing on it.

320
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,440

"K2--2008."

321
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,080
Flag for the dead?

322
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,070
Someone died during that trip up k2.

323
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,940
Who else was on that climb?

324
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,550
Bill only ever climbed with
one other man-- evan tucker.

325
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,090
It was just the two of them on k2.

326
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,520
Evan tucker come back?

327
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,320
Yes. Bill and tucker both
came down off that mountain.

328
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,570
So who died up there?

329
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,640
What's going on?

330
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,940
I don't know. You tell me.

331
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,280
Didn't you call me in here?

332
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,320
I called you in here,both of you.

333
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,190
I got a problem.

334
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,100
Maybe you two don't
want me here for this.

335
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,390
Stow it,stark.

336
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:58,240
Now,I have an unsolved shooting of
a police officer,my police officer,

337
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,300
and I've got a witness
who's not talking.

338
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,930
Charlie says he doesn't remember
who shot him. It happens.

339
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,930
Did I say it was a good time to talk?

340
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,830
Now,you are his old partner,and
you're his current partner.

341
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,870
So I want to ask you two a question.

342
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,160
I don't think I like being
questioned in this room.

343
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,480
Why wouldn't crews tell us who shot him?

344
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,730
Why would he keep that to himself?

345
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,440
What's he doing?

346
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,590
when I wish to forgive
another,what do I mean?

347
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,480
I mean I wish to forgive myself.

348
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,920
When I wish to harm
another,what do I mean?

349
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,350
I mean I wish to harm myself.

350
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:14,800
Close your eyes and think of
the world as seen from space.

351
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,820
From that distance,it is calm...

352
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,080
silent...

353
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,200
at peace...

354
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,050
one.

355
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,450
Calm,silent...

356
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,260
at peace...

357
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,490
one.

358
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,700
Because of a paper flag?

359
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,710
Paper mourning flag.

360
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,590
If ellis had it
made,someone died up there.

361
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,620
We checked with the k2 base camp station

362
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,950
there were no reported
fatalities during the time

363
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,240
that ellis and tucker
were up on that mountain.

364
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,020
You see that flag,you think
there was an unreported fatality.

365
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,470
Ellis and tucker both went up that
mountain. Ellis and tucker both came down.

366
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,790
evan tucker is not fortune 500.

367
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,140
Tucker's a manager at sporty mart.

368
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,700
How did he know william ellis?

369
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,310
Tucker only works half the year to pay for the six
months he spends on the global adventure circuit.

370
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,910
that's how he met ellis.

371
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,960
According to breem,they
just became real close.

372
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,550
They only climbed with
each other--a club of two.

373
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,830
You two talk to tucker.

374
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,620
Find out who didn't come
down off that mountain.

375
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,040
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

376
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,240
You go first.

377
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,160
Okay,okay,I'll go first.

378
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,690
That was tucker's kid.

379
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:46,840
Says her dad has been on a company retreat
for the last week-- backwoods,no phones.

380
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,280
Okay. That was the assistant
manager from sporty mart.

381
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:53,380
She says that tucker has been on a
family vacation for the last week--

382
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:56,020
backwoods,no phones.

383
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:59,160
Both ellis and tucker knew
who died on that mountain.

384
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,090
But now ellis is dead and...

385
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,600
tucker's been missing for a week.

386
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,840
Hi,this is detective
crews. Your mom around?

387
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,650
Hi,mrs. Tucker,this is
detective crews,lapd.

388
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:20,100
We're investigating
the death of bill ellis.

389
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,780
We know that your husband
climbed k2 with him last year.

390
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,980
Were there any fatalities on that trip?

391
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:30,910
Did someone die up there?

392
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,680
Okay,well,then maybe you'd like to
come down here and talk about that.

393
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,870
Tucker's wife says there
was a death up there.

394
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,230
Does she know who it was?

395
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,060
Well,did she tell you?

396
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,010
Tucker's wife says tucker died.

397
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,570
you saw your husband last week.

398
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,160
Yes.

399
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,720
But you told my partner on the
phone that he died up on k2.

400
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,180
He did.

401
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,250
How did he die,mrs. Tucker?

402
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,900
William ellis killed him.

403
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,550
His body isn't dead,is it,mrs. Tucker?

404
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,920
He's just not the same man that
went up that mountain,is he?

405
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:36,600
My husband and william
ellis were at 12,000 feet,

406
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,880
tethered together.

407
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:44,840
My husband lost his footing,and
w-- went over the edge.

408
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,410
He was pulling ellis down.

409
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,580
Ellis cut the rope.

410
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,400
And evan fell...

411
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,810
hundreds of feet.

412
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,030
He fell...

413
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:03,290
all alone and falling.

414
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,080
- But he didn't die.
- Nope.

415
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:12,690
Uh,angles of slope,drift
density,wind speed--

416
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,370
he was barely bruised.

417
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,310
Ellis,the hero,cut the rope.

418
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,310
Ellis let my husband fall.

419
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,080
Do you know where your husband is?

420
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,880
Where were you when ellis died?

421
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,240
Alone with our children.

422
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,070
I'm always alone with our children
since he came down off that mountain.

423
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,150
Mrs. Tucker,do you think your
husband could've killed ellis?

424
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:47,610
No. But I'm glad someone did.

425
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,710
Ellis cuts the rope...

426
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,120
tucker falls to his
death,but doesn't die.

427
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,170
And ellis needs to go back into space.

428
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,360
Thanks so much.

429
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,810
Got a little more information from the
assistant manager where tucker worked.

430
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,240
Since he'd come back from k2,he'd become less
interested in all the sports he usually did,

431
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,330
and he focused on just one sport.

432
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,530
Did she say what it was?

433
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,060
She did.

434
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,860
Was it skydiving?

435
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:27,170
We're looking for someone who could've
shot ellis,then jumped out of that plane,

436
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:30,360
and our lead suspect has a
sudden interest in skydiving.

437
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,190
Ran a credit-card check on tucker.

438
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,800
We got a hit at a perris motel.

439
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,850
Paris,france?

440
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,910
Perris,california--
skydiving capital of america.

441
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:41,640
Tucker's credit statements show that he's
been out there on and off for the last year.

442
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,660
Since k2.

443
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,390
Then you two head out to perris.

444
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,870
Uh,captain? A word.

445
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,920
This isn't the part
where you kiss me,is it?

446
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,760
Don't you ever call me into
that interrogation room again.

447
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:05,300
And if you have a question for my
partner,then you ask my partner.

448
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:10,890
I just wanted to find out who shot him,because
he's one of my cops and because you were there.

449
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,320
Maybe next time you get hit too.

450
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:18,220
Don't you ever call me into
that interrogation room again.

451
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:31,160
Okay,you asked about debt.
Let's talk about debt.

452
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,360
Simply put,debt is
anything that you owe.

453
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:39,680
Now,can anybody give me an example?

454
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:43,210
I still owe you a beating.

455
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,120
Oh,you mean because of
that bun I took from you?

456
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,000
Yeah,because of that bun
they let you take from me.

457
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,200
Ah,uh-uh,it's okay. It's okay. Okay.

458
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:58,730
Yeah,you,uh,you still owe me a beating.

459
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:04,290
Yeah,but I guess those babysitters charlie crews sent
are gonna keep you from collecting that beating,huh?

460
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,360
You don't have to do this.

461
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:15,150
Yeah,I do.

462
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:17,420
It's okay. The guards will break it up.

463
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,780
Not quick enough.

464
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:23,560
Okay,white collar,let's get it on.

465
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,420
we're looking for evan tucker.

466
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,680
Tucker? He's around here someplace.

467
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,360
You're cops. Is he in trouble?

468
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:34,450
We just need to talk to him.

469
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,350
He just went to jump. He
should be back in half an hour.

470
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,640
Tuck been coming here long?

471
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,080
About a year. He started as a student.

472
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,200
Now he's as good as
any of the instructors.

473
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,900
Tuck is fearless.

474
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,090
That a record of the students' jumps?

475
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,760
yeah,heights,pull times.

476
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,190
Tuck on that board?

477
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,320
He's there somewhere.

478
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,800
Ellis' plane was flying
at about 8,000 feet.

479
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,920
Let's see if tucker was training
to jump from that height.

480
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,240
I want to jump out of a plane.

481
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,600
Be a part of the air
and one with the sky?

482
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,170
No,I just want to jump out of a plane.

483
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,870
Tucker's jumps over the last month.

484
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:16,990
Look at this.

485
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,800
He was waiting longer and
longer before he pulled the cord.

486
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,980
He was getting closer
and closer to the ground.

487
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,300
You want to jump out of a
plane,and you don't want to be seen?

488
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,790
Then you wait as long as possible
before opening your chute.

489
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,680
Tucker was training to jump out
of a plane without being seen.

490
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,790
Don't you need a warrant for that?

491
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,860
- Maybe.
- Maybe not.

492
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,390
Is this tucker's only chute?

493
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,830
What is he doing on a
plane without a chute?

494
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,620
Hey,which plane is tucker in?

495
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,950
That one.

496
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,400
he's fearless,huh?

497
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,500
Yeah,tuck sure is fearless.

498
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,200
Were you always that way?

499
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,010
Or was it just because what happened
to you and ellis up on that mountain?

500
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,170
Fearless?

501
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,440
You touch death,and all that
fear just goes away,right?

502
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,260
It's time for me to fall.

503
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,180
Evan tucker,on your knees.

504
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,800
It's time for me to fall!

505
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:50,080
On your knees now!

506
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,580
A buddhist flag for the dead.

507
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:13,930
How'd you know what happens
when you touch death?

508
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,320
Detective crews.

509
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,790
Got something that belongs to you.

510
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:50,580
That bullet was yours. The next is mine.

511
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,500
Make the call.

512
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,550
What call?

513
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,440
The call that gets ted
earley out of prison.

514
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,540
There,it's done.

515
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,620
What was that?

516
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,790
Text message.

517
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,360
The call isn't even a
call anymore? It's a text?

518
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,560
I'm never catching up.

519
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,230
How much did roman pay you to shoot me?

520
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,860
You think it's about the money.

521
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:37,020
Roman uses people's weaknesses.

522
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,580
Where's your family,agent bodner?

523
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,270
I sent them away.

524
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,310
Because you're afraid of
what roman will do to them?

525
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,780
Roman nevikov came to my house.

526
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,120
I come home,he's
drinking tea with my wife.

527
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,970
My daughter is on roman's knee.

528
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:57,050
I sent them away.

529
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,980
Call me after your leg heals.

530
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,270
And don't throw that bullet away.

531
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,490
Found this when we searched
your perris motel room,tucker.

532
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,120
ballistics matched it to the
gun that killed william ellis.

533
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,780
You remember him,don't you?

534
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,060
Will ellis cut your rope.

535
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,340
William ellis let you fall.

536
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,700
Is that why you killed him?

537
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,890
You wouldn't understand.

538
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,980
We understand you went
up without a chute today.

539
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,270
Tucker,you feeling guilty about ellis?

540
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,530
You wouldn't understand.

541
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,370
Not that we blame you.

542
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,680
Anybody would want to do that to
someone who did what ellis did to you.

543
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:39,360
What william ellis did is
show me the face of god.

544
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,650
The face of...

545
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,880
Of god.

546
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:46,290
What did it look like,tucker?

547
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,190
It was beautiful.

548
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:54,900
Like...

549
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,910
the sun coming closer...

550
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,040
blinding me,but I could
still see everything.

551
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,810
Tucker,you didn't hate
william ellis,did you?

552
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,760
Why would I?

553
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,030
Because he cut your rope.

554
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,170
No,I had to beg him to do it.

555
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,740
We were both going over. I told him to
cut the rope. He didn't want to do it.

556
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:24,050
He didn't want to do
it. I had to beg him.

557
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,260
And then you fell.

558
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,600
But now ellis is dead.

559
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,240
No,he's not dead.

560
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:39,040
Just went back where he came from.

561
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,400
What was that,tucker?

562
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:43,350
Just went back where he came from.

563
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:46,430
That's what ellis used to say.

564
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,010
About going back into space.

565
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,360
What?

566
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,400
It's like going back where he came from?

567
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:11,360
That's what breem said
about being in space.

568
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,140
That's what tucker said ellis
said about being in space.

569
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:18,170
Well,maybe they were
both spacemen poets,crews.

570
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,730
And they both wrote the same poem?

571
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,780
Maybe one's a poet,and one's a liar.

572
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:28,050
You think nasa has a
listed telephone number?

573
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,050
It's a government agency.

574
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:34,300
Our tax dollars at work. I'll bet
they got a listed phone number.

575
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:36,800
Yes!

576
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,360
Need the number for nasa.

577
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,940
Checked with nasa.

578
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:45,570
Mick breem never
actually went into space.

579
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,810
He trained with ellis,but
he was an alternate.

580
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,640
He never went up there.

581
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,960
He padded his resume. I don't
think that makes him a killer.

582
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:53,260
And you got the guy with the gun,right?

583
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:56,470
What? You don't think tucker did it?

584
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,850
Because...

585
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,650
Because he saw the face of god.

586
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,340
Saw the face of... yeah.

587
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:09,020
We had a guy once in manhattan south who saw
the virgin mary on a grilled cheese sandwich.

588
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,720
Killed seven people with a tire
iron over the course of the week.

589
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:13,220
Tucker didn't mention grilled cheese.

590
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,740
Is this about him nearly
dying and you nearly dying?

591
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,960
Nope. I don't think it is.

592
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:22,240
At least tucker remembers
who cut his rope.

593
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,740
Finally got the financials
on ellis propulsion.

594
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,770
They just unsealed his will.

595
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:30,990
Guess who william ellis
left his company to.

596
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:39,760
Dean,how come you didn't tell us you
weren't getting your father's company?

597
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:42,310
What? I'm not getting the company?

598
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,630
- Mick breem is getting the company.
- What?

599
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,400
Mick breem is getting the company?

600
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:55,100
Well,yeah,I guess.

601
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:58,740
oh,well,yeah,you guess?

602
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,310
You guess what,dean?

603
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,950
I guess that makes sense.

604
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:07,870
Dad always said,"the right
person for the right job."

605
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,500
I guess dad knew that wasn't me.

606
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,970
Did mick breem kill my father?

607
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:19,220
if your father lived,breem gets nothing.

608
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,120
When he died,breem got the company.

609
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:28,010
Because mick breem is the
right person for the job.

610
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,730
Reese?

611
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,650
We're the wrong people for this job.

612
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,390
Excuse me. Excuse me.

613
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:50,080
Watch out. Coming through.

614
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,750
- But it's not a plane.
- I know that.

615
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:01,160
But let's just say it is. Let's just say
this is the plane william ellis died in.

616
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:05,000
Crews.

617
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:08,540
Breem and ellis were both nasa
trained. It's what made them.

618
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:12,320
Okay,I understand that,but why are
you and tucker sitting like that?

619
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,990
It's the plane william died in.

620
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,560
Breem isn't gonna tell us how he did it.

621
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,020
How would ellis do it?

622
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,910
- Ellis is dead.
- Ellis is dead.

623
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:22,700
It's the plane ellis died in.

624
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,260
They both went through
nasa,did things the same way.

625
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:29,900
If we knew how ellis would've done
it,maybe we can figure out how breem did it.

626
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,720
Oh,not you too.

627
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:33,110
Tucker.

628
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:38,010
If ellis were gonna do this-- kill
a man and then jump from that plane--

629
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,430
how would he have done it?

630
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,780
It's the plane ellis died in.

631
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,570
William "bull" ellis was nasa.

632
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,990
He said everything
in life was a mission.

633
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,060
And for a mission,you have to train.

634
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,590
So how did breem train?

635
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,820
And where would he do it?

636
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:17,280
Let's start faxing his
picture around,shall we?

637
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:21,070
I have a captain tidwell on line one.

638
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:24,530
Mr. Breem,captain kevin tidwell,lapd.

639
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,900
What can I do for you,captain?

640
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,890
Tracked down that
charter pilot you used--

641
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,150
nevada,out of state,nice.

642
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,060
Used? Used for what?

643
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,620
To train--once a week
for the last two months.

644
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,120
Training to...

645
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:40,950
jump from a small plane at 8,000 feet-- the
cruising altitude of william ellis' plane.

646
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,860
you used a different name,so we faxed your
picture to the airfields in four states.

647
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:48,170
One of them puts your
face to the fake name.

648
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:51,390
and once we have that name,we get
you buying that gun there in nevada.

649
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,210
The gun you planted on tucker.

650
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:57,390
william ellis sells his company,goes
up into space,you get nothing.

651
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:01,280
William ellis dies,you get it all.

652
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,620
You never actually went up into space.

653
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,940
I never actually did.

654
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,930
well,think of it
this way,mr. Breem--

655
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,000
that now you get to go someplace
bill ellis never got to go.

656
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,900
Okay,you don't remember who shot you.

657
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,960
Anything else you don't
remember about that day?

658
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:33,570
If I don't remember it,how would
I know if I remembered or not?

659
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,780
Unless I forgot to remember.

660
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,070
Crews,you know what I mean.

661
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:44,500
Yeah,I know what you mean.

662
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,790
I remember you asking me a question

663
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,470
about your father having something
to do with me going to jail.

664
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,510
You still want to know the answer?

665
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:59,280
Yeah... I do.

666
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,290
Your father wasn't responsible
for me going to jail.

667
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:27,320
I was teaching a class
on the,uh,nature of debt.

668
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,990
We had a discussion.

669
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,200
Where do you want to go?

670
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,390
Anywhere else.

671
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,210
Fast.

672
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,120
Well,that,ted...

673
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,950
will not be a problem.

674
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,700
and think of the world
as seen from space.

675
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,950
From that distance, it is calm,silent,

676
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,020
at peace...

677
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,760
one.
