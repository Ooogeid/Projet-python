1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,450
Your name is roman nevikov?

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,800
My name is roman nevikov.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,180
Aren't you supposed to be in prison?

4
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,470
No man is supposed to be in prison.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,260
But the federal authorities
believe that you're in prison.

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,440
Yes,they believe that.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,520
So how can you be here?

8
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,410
A man I know has kindly
offered to serve my time for me.

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,380
That was very nice of him.

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,400
People like to do favors for me.

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,260
Always have. I don't know why.

12
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,560
Maybe it's because you'll kill
their families if they don't.

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,770
Yes,maybe.

14
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,620
Can we talk about charlie crews?

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,470
Isn't that why you are here?

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,390
If you could say one thing to
charlie crews,what would it be?

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,910
One thing? Anything?

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,150
Yes,anything.

19
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,890
This is what I would like
to say to charlie crews.

20
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:16,391
I just borrow your camera.

21
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,540
My friends.
My true camarades.

22
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,240
Detective Reese.
So beautiful.

23
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,530
Would you like to say hi?

24
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,390
Oh,we'd better change this tape.

25
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,250
If anyone's seen where we are,yes?

26
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,440
Okay. Go ahead. Say it.

27
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,140
Crews.

30
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,470
Play it again from the beginning.

31
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:03,470
Okay. Go ahead. Say it.

32
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,250
Crews,he says he wants rayborn.

33
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,940
He says you bring rayborn to him...

34
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:18,320
You bring rayborn to
him and I can go.Crews--

35
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,460
but rayborn is dead.

36
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,950
I know that.

37
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,690
So why does roman nevikov
think mickey rayborn is alive?

38
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,200
Maybe he knows something we don't.

39
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,150
Well,you got about five minutes
to figure out what that is.

40
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,500
The brass saw that tape. Now
they're coming down here to see you.

41
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,290
And I could care less
what they do with you,

42
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,210
But you will tell me why nevikov
thinks rayborn is still alive

43
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,130
And you will tell me what I
need to know to get reese back.

44
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,750
You want her back?

45
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,770
Well,i should go before
the brass gets here.

46
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,190
Okay,where's your first stop?

47
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,280
Our friends at the f.b.i.

48
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,530
No,last time we asked them
questions they stonewalled us.

49
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,070
Last time I asked them
questions like a cop.

50
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,760
This time it'll be a little different.

51
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,010
- I should,uh,maybe leave this.
- No,no. Keep it. It'll help.

52
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,270
But leave your phone.
They'll track you on it.

53
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,110
Here. Take mine. They won't look for it.

54
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,870
Detective crews. You go get her.

55
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,260
Got nothing else to do today.

56
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,720
Charlie.

57
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,150
Where's detective crews?

58
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,270
You see where crewsent?

59
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,250
Find him.

60
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,640
What we learned as children,that
one plus one equals two,

61
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,950
we know to be false.

62
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,130
One plus one equals one.

63
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,330
We even have a word for when
you plus another equals one.

64
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,260
That
word is--

65
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,110
I need to see rayborn's body.

66
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,950
And you think that crews is
gonna give you what you want?

67
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,190
He'll find you,but he won't
give you what you want.

68
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,290
He'll give you something else.

69
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,830
And what is that?

70
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,720
I think you know what that is.

71
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,370
You're connected to me.

72
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,410
I'm connected to crews.

73
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,590
- He'll find you.
- Connected.

74
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,840
That was our friend.

75
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,770
He says crews is probably
headed back this way.

76
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:58,330
And he wants you to pick up his shirts.

77
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,890
- You do that for him?
- Yeah.

78
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,690
Hello.

79
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,810
Detective crews. It's seever. Do not
go to the f.b.i. There was a shooting.

80
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,250
The people you're going
to see are no longer there.

81
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,550
There's three dead.

82
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,190
You have the names of the f.b.i. Dead?

83
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,010
Yeah.

84
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,050
- Any of them bodner?
- No.

85
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,630
- They catch the shooter?
- No.

86
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,230
Not my phone. Not my numbers.

87
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,810
Tidwell's phone. Tidwell's numbers.

88
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,870
But I can...

89
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:07,210
I can get the number that just
dialed me. I can do that,right?

90
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,990
This is jane seever. Leave a message.

91
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,890
Seever,go to my phone. I need
bodner's number. Call me with it.

92
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,660
Roman send you?

93
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,870
Yeah.

94
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,570
I'm done.

95
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,690
I'm done,aren't i?

96
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,990
Charlie,i got that number.
I'm gonna text it to you,okay?

97
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,520
Got it. Hey,bobby. Get rid of my phone.

98
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,730
Charlie,get rid of your car.

99
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,230
But I just got it back.

100
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:36,830
That'll kill you. The
coffee. It'll kill you.

101
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,370
- You could have killed me.
- But I didn't.

102
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,730
But you could have.

103
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,480
I saw his head by the window.

104
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,560
How did you know I wasn't
standing right next to him?

105
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,430
Because if he were here to kill
you,he'd have made you stand over there.

106
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,920
What if he wasn't here to kill me?

107
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,820
Then i'd have to kill you.

108
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,290
Agent bodner,if he wasn't here to kill
you,you're still working for roman.

109
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,640
And i'd have to kill you.

110
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,110
What's going on out there?

111
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,380
Roman has reese.

112
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,620
- So what does roman want with you?
- Rayborn.

113
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,510
But rayborn's dead.

114
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,630
Roman wants him anyway.

115
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,800
We should go.

116
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,210
- We can't take that.
- I just got it back.

117
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,700
My wife and kids are still
gone. Maybe we can take her...

118
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,830
Her what?

119
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,010
Her minivan.

120
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,190
Smooth ride.

121
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,120
Four-star rating.

122
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,070
Two dvd players. 16 cup holders.

123
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,910
What if roman was right?

124
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,260
What if rayborn is still alive?

125
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,820
I saw the pictures of that boat.
How do you live through that?

126
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,020
People live through a lot of
things you never thought they could.

127
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,970
Yeah? Okay.

128
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,900
Everyone's looking for roman nevikov.

129
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,630
Maybe we should look for rayborn.

130
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,410
Well,l.a.p.d.,f.b.i.,and that fancy
security expert can't find his body.

131
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,760
His body. His sick body.

132
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,470
Rayborn was sick,was having
treatments almost every day.

133
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,100
If he is still
alive,then--

134
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,020
He still needs those treatments.

135
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,190
Let's go see his doctor.

136
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,750
Mr. Rayborn was being treated
for a very rare form of cancer.

137
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,260
Charlie would like the name of
his doctor. Do you have that?

138
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,740
Yes,i do.

139
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,520
He never went anywhere
without one of our men.

140
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,470
Except the night he went missing.

141
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,430
He would take his boat out on his own.

142
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,650
I tried to dissuade him of that practice but he'd
assured me that there were no pirates in los angeles.

143
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,730
This is the name of his doctor.

144
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,700
Thanks,ted. Stay there.

145
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,320
We might need ms.
Puryer's services again.

146
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,100
Sippy cup.

147
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,400
How long you been married?

148
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,110
20 years. Still love her.

149
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,830
- Where'd you meet?
- In the bureau.

150
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,160
We were partners.

151
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,390
There is something else
you could do for me.

152
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,610
You wish me to find your olivia now?

153
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,520
My? She's not "my" olivia.

154
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,720
Clearly.

155
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,400
We've got a dead f.b.i. Agent in there.

156
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,000
Not the one who lives here.

157
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,360
We've got detective crews'
car but no detective crews.

158
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:49,140
And we've tracked detective crews' cell
phone to the trash can in your break room.

159
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,380
You find crews. He's on my cell.

160
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,590
You up for this?

161
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,250
Oh,yeah. I'm up for this.

162
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,790
That information is privileged.

163
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,800
Look,doc,your patient
might still be alive.

164
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,530
If he is,he's getting
treatment somewhere.

165
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,620
You're not still treating
mickey rayborn,are you?

166
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,970
No. I'm not still treating him.

167
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,190
Doc,I'm gonna have to lock the door now.

168
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,440
You understand me?

169
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,030
You are l.a.p.d.?

170
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,880
Yeah,but not at the moment.

171
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,970
- And you're f.b.i.
- but not at the moment.

172
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,430
Then who are you at the moment?

173
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,650
I'm just a guy with one question--
what did mickey rayborn suffer from?

174
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,520
It's a very rare form of cancer.

175
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,980
And the treatment?

176
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,690
It's very technical.

177
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,200
But it made him weak.

178
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,480
It made him pale.

179
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,620
What did we find on
that boat,agent bodner?

180
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,100
We found a lot of blood.

181
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,910
Weak? Pale?

182
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,640
Those are symptoms of
blood loss,right,doc?

183
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,510
Okay. I'm gonna lock the door.

184
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,810
He wasn't sick. He wasn't.

185
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,500
- And the treatments?
- I was stockpiling his blood.

186
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,190
It's a common practice.

187
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,290
Patients do it before
surgery all the time.

188
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,040
But he wasn't having surgery.

189
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,230
No. He wasn't.

190
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,810
It was for that boat.

191
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,060
To make us think he was dead. Enough
so that we wouldn't question it.

192
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,900
He's been planning this for a while.

193
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,080
Yeah,he has. But why?

194
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,490
this is your plan?

195
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,100
My plan is on the way.

196
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,330
They put you away for killing
that guy you owned that bar with?

197
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,260
You did 12 years hard time?

198
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,100
And you got $50 million?

199
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,210
Now you're eating burgers in the back of a
minivan on the run from half the cops in l.a.

200
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,600
You've made some
interesting career choices.

201
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,520
I am where I am.

202
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,160
How far back you go with rayborn?

203
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,850
I don't go back with rayborn at all.

204
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,280
But that guy you owned that bar with.

205
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,340
Tom seybolt.

206
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,240
You and him were laundering
money for rayborn,right?

207
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,300
No,not me and him. Just him.

208
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,030
Just him?

209
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,210
He was your friend and you didn't know?

210
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,290
I guess I didn't know him.

211
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,550
Is this a private club
or can anyone join?

212
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,450
That depends on if you
got me what I asked for.

213
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,490
It's not zen,charlie.

214
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,320
It'll just have to do
until zen comes along.

215
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,280
Charlie,i know she's your partner,but
maybe you should let someone else--

216
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,510
Everyone else go after her.

217
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,380
- Roman wants me.
- Yeah.

218
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,460
Why is that?

219
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,260
What is it,roman?

220
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,970
Things not going according to plan?

221
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,530
He's getting closer,isn't he?

222
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,620
He's out there,but he's getting closer.

223
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,720
And you're hiding in this basement.

224
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,400
Connection by connection...

225
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,030
Until he's right in front of you.

226
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,820
That is where I want him.

227
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,940
Sounds like you're in love,roman.

228
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,920
Go ahead.

229
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,600
Go ahead,cry. I will understand.

230
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,200
It runs in your family.

231
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,970
Your father...

232
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,460
He cried before I killed him.

233
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,900
Crews,he says he wants rayborn.

234
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,990
He says you bring rayborn to him...

235
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,800
You bring rayborn to
him and I can go.Crews--

236
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,860
there's something in the back.

237
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:32,870
We've e.q.ed out everything.

238
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,760
In the back we have dogs,russian
techno,men's and women's voices--

239
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,370
No,it's something else.

240
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,670
Some other,uh,music. Keep working it.

241
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,990
Captain tidwell.

242
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,160
May I see your phone,please?

243
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,780
- My--
- your phone.Your cell phone.

244
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,680
It's in my office.
I'll have to go get it.

245
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,220
I can't seem to find it.

246
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,370
I'm always losing it somewhere.

247
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,710
Maybe someone picked it up by accident.

248
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:05,690
Is it possible detective
crews picked it up by accident?

249
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,270
Anything's possible.

250
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,920
Pull the vehicle over to the curb.

251
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,460
Keep your hands where I can see them.

252
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,300
Sure hope you kids got just
cause for pulling us over

253
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,720
because this man here is
a federal agent and me?

254
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,450
I'm just in a real bad mood.

255
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,560
Sir,i need to see your phones.

256
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,350
Oh,what do you know.

257
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,410
Must have walked off with my
captain's phone by accident.

258
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,920
They catch you with me,you're
back in uniform-- if you're lucky.

259
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,710
They catch me with you,i'll
say I'm bringing you in,

260
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,700
i get promoted,and luck
has nothing to do with it.

261
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,260
Fair enough.

262
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,430
Fair enough.

263
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,130
Disposable phone.

264
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,890
Who are you calling?

265
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,830
Rayborn likes his pleasures.

266
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,660
If he disappears,he's
going first-class.

267
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,760
His money is all still here.

268
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,640
Come on,ted. A guy like rayborn
must have undisclosed wealth.

269
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,280
Well,undisclosed to the
government,yes. But not to us.

270
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,500
We provide total protection,all aspects.

271
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,000
Well,not all aspects.

272
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,200
We hadn't counted on having to
protect mr. Rayborn from himself.

273
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,120
It's all there,charlie.

274
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,050
How much?

275
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,530
He's big. Bigger than you.

276
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:56,690
Even bigger than I ever was,and
we all know how big that was.

277
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,250
Well,what about the cars,boat,jet?

278
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,120
It's all where he left it. He-- he
just left everything sitting there.

279
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,530
Took nothing but a plan. Thanks.

280
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,660
You never asked exactly
what he was dying of?

281
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,840
Well,i assumed he was
reticent to speak of it.

282
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,820
I mean,powerful men are often loath to
consider their own fragile mortality.

283
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,400
I'm a grandfather.

284
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,880
His name's ted,my grandson.

285
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,910
It's all over after that,right?

286
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:41,850
You're all done after
you're a grandfather.

287
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,250
Spain.

288
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,910
Your olivia. In spain now.

289
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,300
I know. She's not "your" olivia.

290
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,190
rayborn leaves with nothing but a plan.

291
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,450
How do you live with no money?

292
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,260
How do you live with no money?

293
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,640
That's what I just said.

294
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,600
It's a good question.

295
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,380
How does he live with no money?

296
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,630
Homeless shelters were part
of mr. Rayborn's philanthropy.

297
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,390
How many shelters does he operate?

298
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:26,050
The rayborn foundation operates five homeless
shelters in the greater los angeles area.

299
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,660
- Does he visit them?
- Yes. Frequently.

300
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,690
Does anyone from your
office go with him?

301
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,810
of course.

302
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,980
Does he visit all of them?

303
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,350
Let me check his account.

304
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,950
No,he did not.

305
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,580
He only visited four of them.

306
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:48,140
So there's one where rayborn
has never shown his face?

307
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,970
But I did know him.

308
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,550
Tom seybolt was my friend.

309
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,560
Detective crews?

310
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,570
Could I ask you to do something?

311
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,350
I need you to get a murder case file.

312
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,920
The seybolt killings.

313
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,550
Okay,yeah. Sure.

314
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,410
You want to do this first?

315
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,290
Found me,huh,kiddo?

316
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,520
I always knew you were a good cop.

317
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,330
Crews,he says he wants rayborn.

318
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,200
Not music but I know that sound.

319
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,040
Says you bring rayborn to him...

320
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,280
You hear that? Listen.

321
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,730
I'm sorry,i don't hear anything.

322
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,840
It's a subway.

323
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,320
Listen.

324
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,040
Crews,he says he wants rayborn.

325
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,020
Don't give me that look.

326
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:27,590
I know what a subway sounds like.

327
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,920
Even if it is,there must be
a truckload of places in l.a.

328
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,520
You could hear the
subway from that level.

329
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:33,600
Then we send a truckload of cops.

330
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,560
Easy,kiddo.

331
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,850
I'm a dying man.

332
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,950
Except you're not dying.

333
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,890
We're all dying.

334
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,180
Some sooner than others.

335
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,680
Detective crews.

336
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,150
This will not bring
detective reese back.

337
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,520
Where's your partner,kiddo?

338
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,420
Don't call me "kiddo."

339
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,300
get her back from whom?

340
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,400
You know the answer to that.

341
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,030
From roman nevikov.

342
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,250
What's he want for her?

343
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:01,620
You know the answer to that,too.

344
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,460
He wants me,does he?

345
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,790
I fooled everyone but the russian.

346
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,980
He would need to see my body.

347
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,500
Even with all that
blood,he'd need to see it.

348
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,960
So what are you going to do?

349
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,600
I'm gonna give you to roman.

350
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:30,410
It goes through six shell companies and two
cousins but that building belongs to roman nevikov.

351
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,800
I know what a subway sounds like.

352
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,730
We got a body here.

353
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,370
Captain,we have not
secured that area yet!

354
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,570
Follow him!

355
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,560
What does roman want with him?

356
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,660
Roman wants his money.

357
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,760
Let's go get your partner back.

358
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,280
How do we let roman
know that we have him?

359
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:40,160
That part is easy.

360
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,920
You are not under arresting me?

361
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,760
I was hoping we could
work something out.

362
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,240
That will not be problem.

363
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,960
I just need you to talk.

364
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:03,300
You want me to be bad girl?

365
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:10,610
I need you to talk to your friends,and
then they'll tell their friends,

366
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,780
And then roman will hear what
charlie crews wants to tell him.

367
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,680
And-- and
what is that?

368
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,430
Head on out the 10.

369
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,780
I already read it.

370
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,070
The case file from your arrest.

371
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,230
When I found out I was
assigned to you,i read it.

372
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,580
Eh,you like to be prepared.

373
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,890
What do you want to
know,detective crews?

374
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,430
I think you'd need to see it.

375
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,360
No,i don't.

376
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,700
- I have a--
- photographic memory?

377
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:46,010
Eidetic is the technical term,

378
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:52,380
but yes, I have the ability to recall text
with extreme accuracy and in abundant volume.

379
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,250
The man I owned that bar with--
the man who was murdered--

380
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,640
Tom seybolt.

381
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,690
What did they find in his desk?

382
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,160
The cops pulled evidence from his desk.

383
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:11,420
Tax forms,uh,drawings
that his kids made,

384
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,380
a photo of you two fishing,

385
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,430
an application.

386
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,120
For a cab license?

387
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,570
A cab license.

388
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,130
Does that mean anything?

389
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,680
It means he needed a second job.

390
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,860
It means he need money.

391
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:33,880
I-if your friend was laundering
money,why would he need a second job?

392
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,030
I knew my friend.

393
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,010
What if he wasn't laundering money?

394
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:47,420
If he wasn't dirty,then he wasn't
killed because he was skimming.

395
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,920
So why'd they kill him?

396
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:55,110
If my friend was clean,if tom was clean,

397
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:00,690
then maybe they went to lean
on him to try to get him dirty.

398
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,140
He was a run-of-the-mill
bar owner.

399
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,560
Why get him dirty?

400
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,610
Because he owned that bar with a cop.

401
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:16,190
If you get him dirty,you
get a cop dirty.

402
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:23,240
You own him,you own a cop.

403
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:28,460
But that cop is you.

404
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,220
Seever,pull the car over.

405
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,920
The journey,kiddo,always
leads back inside.

406
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,360
Ain't that grand?

407
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,880
You have to save reese.

408
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,240
You always knew I was a good cop?

409
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,480
What do you mean by "always"?

410
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,910
How long have you known me?

411
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:11,520
You are a good cop because you listen.

412
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:15,500
"always" means before the
killings,the arrest,the trial.

413
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,130
I saw you at the academy.

414
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,210
You had that look.

415
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,020
There.

416
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,510
That look.

417
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,260
What were you doing at the academy?

418
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,220
I knew someday i'd be old.

419
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:30,040
We'd need a younger
man to run this thing.

420
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:34,480
I looked at every cadet,and I chose you.

421
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:39,360
I was gonna get that tom seybolt a little
dirty so you would have to help him out.

422
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:42,970
Now,that family was not supposed to die.

423
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,850
You were not supposed to go to jail.

424
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,210
But they did.

425
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,520
And you did.

426
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,320
But just look at you.

427
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:54,310
I chose you,kiddo.

428
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,310
And I was right.

429
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,610
I was right.

430
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:58,800
Don't call me "kiddo."

431
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,400
It's always been about you,charlie.

432
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:07,310
Even that animal roman knows that.

433
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,980
Where is he?

434
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,460
Where is rayborn?

435
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,010
I didn't bring him.

436
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,080
Did you bring reese?

437
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,160
I do not trust you.

438
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,280
You do not trust me.

439
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,840
How do we do this?

440
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,460
Easy.

441
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,330
I just need you to tell me one thing.

442
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:06,360
I need you to tell me
why you want rayborn.

443
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,530
Because I do.

444
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,830
No.

445
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,360
That's just how bad
you want him,not why.

446
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:18,750
Is it just the money? 'Cause I
don't think it's just the money.

447
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:21,420
If you want reese,you bring him to me.

448
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,010
Then tell me why you want him.

449
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:33,130
Okay. Then you can't have him.

450
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,190
But you can have this.

451
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:45,780
That's the bullet you wanted
bodner to kill me with.

452
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,310
It's my gift to you.

453
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:52,280
This-- this
is why he--

454
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,820
this is why he what,roman?

455
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,440
Nothing.

456
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,240
Nothing.

457
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:19,660
There can't be nothing.

458
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,940
I am not attached to that gun.

459
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:45,740
Thank you ever so much.

460
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,590
Where are you going?

461
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:52,320
The police have mr. Rayborn
and detective seever.

462
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,320
I am going to fetch mr. Rayborn now.

463
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,370
What about charlie?

464
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,420
Seems to have gone missing.

465
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:00,750
How did they find them?

466
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,230
Rayborn and seever.

467
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,780
How did the police find them?

468
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:08,350
Well,i told them where to look.

469
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,380
Why would you do that?

470
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,700
Cliome mr. Earley.

471
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,910
You and detective crews are
terribly sweet and serious gentlemen,

472
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,720
but mickey rayborn's my client.

473
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:20,100
Now,i must do my job,mustn't i?

474
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,430
Rayborn told the brass
you saved his life.

475
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,490
Got you a promotion.

476
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,890
You know why he did that,right?

477
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,280
Yes,i do.

478
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,990
Because now I owe him.

479
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,960
Crews was gonna trade rayborn for reese.

480
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,840
That's right.

481
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,200
So what's he gonna do now?

482
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,300
You want me to talk again?

483
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,760
Yeah.

484
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,410
And what shall I say this time?

485
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,910
I'll write it down for you.

486
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,080
Charlie wants to know
if roman likes oranges.

487
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,360
You own this orange grove?

488
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,430
Bought it when I first got out.

489
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,520
Don't get out here as
much as i'd like to.

490
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,930
Not sure I understand you.

491
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,820
Not sure I do,either.

492
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,270
Having a little trouble
with my math today.

493
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,670
Math?

494
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:53,560
Now I'm sure I do not understand you.

495
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,660
Detective new money.

496
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,480
You are there?

497
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,030
I am here.

498
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,520
I am bringing her to you.

499
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:09,950
Is rayborn there?

500
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,110
Yes.

501
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,320
Let me hear you say it.

502
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,990
Rayborn is here.

503
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:19,500
I see any other cop cars,helicopters,

504
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:22,960
i shoot reese in the head
and leave her on road.

505
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,630
What do you mean,your math?

506
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,810
Oh,you know.

507
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,830
Adding things up.

508
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:33,190
Well,i guess I understand that.

509
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,100
How's the family,agent bodner?

510
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,290
Getting along.

511
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,760
Still on holiday?

512
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,090
You must miss them so.

513
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,440
I don't see rayborn.

514
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,660
Sure you do.

515
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,360
He's right here.

516
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,750
But he's not. Shoot her.

517
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:16,220
This is why he what,roman?

518
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,350
You know what I'm talking about.

519
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,130
Wait,wait.

520
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:25,780
What you said to
me-- it's why he what?

521
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,680
Why rayborn what,roman?

522
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,380
Why he didn't choose you?

523
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,540
Is that what?

524
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:34,000
Where is rayborn?

525
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,480
Well,as I said,you're
looking right at him.

526
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:42,260
Whatever you want from
rayborn,you can get it from me now.

527
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:49,370
His accounts,his connections--
everything he knew,i know.

528
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,940
But it's just the money,right?

529
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:55,480
That's all you want.

530
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,270
You for her.

531
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,330
Me for her.

532
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,030
Bring her out.

533
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,110
Just breathe.

534
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,270
No,no. No touching.

535
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,090
No tricks.

536
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,260
Search him.

537
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,050
What was his plan
getting in that s.u.v.?

538
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:41,200
His plan was getting
you out of that s.u.v.

539
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,660
He calls you an animal.

540
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,550
Rayborn.

541
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,760
He calls you an animal.

542
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,860
But it's not so bad,because I've
seen him with his dog,and he loves--

543
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,100
He loves that animal,so you know.

544
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,790
It's not so bad.

545
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,310
I'll need his account numbers.

546
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,410
Foreign and domestic.

547
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,660
Keys to safety deposit boxes.

548
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:18,820
Combinations to home and office safes.

549
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,150
You will give me these things.

550
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:22,860
Sure.

551
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,570
But that's not what you want.

552
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:28,300
What you want is what rayborn gave me.

553
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:31,870
You want him to choose you.

554
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,010
You want what he gives his dog.

555
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:38,500
You want
his--

556
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:57,310
one plus one equals one.

557
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,640
What are those numbers?

558
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,150
Do you want to know how I got
through 12 years of prison?

559
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,100
Your zen?

560
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,840
Like that.

561
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,590
Whatever he had on you
and your families is gone.

562
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:44,600
So we can start over right
now,or we can go on killing.

563
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,630
You fellas do speak english?

564
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:50,440
What we learned as children,

565
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:57,430
that one plus one equals two...

566
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:03,420
We know to be false.

567
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:16,260
went to spain

568
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:25,820
One plus one equals one.

569
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:35,640
We even have a word for when
you plus another equals one.

570
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,210
That word...

571
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,130
Is love.
