2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,000
Did you try turning it on and off?

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,110
The phone or the car?

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,860
- The phone, sir.
- Yes.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,390
- Is it a new phone?
- No.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,400
- It is a new car?
- No. Yes. No.

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,670
No, I mean, it used to be my car,
then I-I gave it to this girl.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,760
And then I got another car,
but then I wanted this car back

9
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,660
because the other one
was full of bullet holes,

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,680
and people kept telling me I shouldn't
be driving a car full of bullet holes.

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,140
So I bought this one back,
but she painted flowers on it.

12
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,330
I had the flowers taken off.
Now the phone won't sync up.

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,240
Have you made sure that you have
correctly entered your personal pin number?

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,780
Can I ask you a question?
Where exactly are you?

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,500
I'm sorry, sir. We are not allowed
to talk about our personal lives.

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,570
You're very far away, aren't you?

17
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,000
Because I'm looking at los angeles,

18
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,760
and I have the feeling that you
are the other side of the world,

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,690
looking at things that
I could only imagine.

20
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,820
Could that be true?

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,580
I am looking at my computer, sir.

22
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,370
Please describe your service
problem to me exactly.

23
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,200
My phone is supposed to sync up with
my car, so I can talk hands-free.

24
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,790
It's against the law for me to
hold my phone while I'm driving,

25
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,350
and I would hate to break
the law, because I'm--

26
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,400
I'm kind of a cop.

27
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,790
Kind of?

28
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,100
I would think that either you
are a cop or you're not a cop.

29
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,370
I'm a cop.

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,700
Neighbors heard the same cd
playing for ten hours straight.

31
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,980
They called the landlord.

32
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,360
The landlord comes in, and he sees this.

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,190
Where's the landlord now?

34
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,310
Under heavy sedation.

35
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,420
Did he say anything?

36
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,220
He said, "man on a stick."

37
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,260
Looks like poison, too.

38
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,640
I'm guessing antifreeze.

39
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,710
Taste of the wine
might've covered it up.

40
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,880
Yeah.

41
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,690
He drinks the wine...

42
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,000
Someone watches him
stumble across the room.

43
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,400
And then someone pins him to the wall.

44
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,580
Man on a stick.

47
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,100
Bleach and ammonia...

48
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,630
Make chlorine.

49
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,920
Antifreeze in the wine
and a broken broom handle.

50
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,730
Yeah, things found around the house.

51
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,040
"Jerome rafts--
financial advisor.

52
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,400
Risk acquisitions--
derivatives."

53
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,080
Maybe jerome mishandled someone's money.

54
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,260
I don't think we're getting
anything off that computer.

55
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,910
You get ripped off, you
bring a gun or a pipe.

56
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,510
Oh, yeah, a pipe is good.

57
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,200
Then you can feel it, you
know, when the bone breaks.

58
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,330
Too much information?

59
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,700
Hey, reese, look at this.

60
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,220
Oh, jerome liked to date.

61
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,390
There's a different woman
in each of these photos.

62
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,640
Well, maybe one of the women
didn't like sharing jerome.

63
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,480
For that, I could see
using antifreeze, bleach...

64
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,330
Ammonia and a broom handle.

65
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,610
Jerome sure looks happy, though.

66
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,170
I'm' looking at jerome.
He doesn't look too happy.

67
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,100
Man on a stick.

68
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,010
Reese, something
else-- there was A...

69
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,590
There was what?

70
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,130
A bird. A pigeon.

71
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,700
It flew against the
window, tried to get in.

72
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,410
That means something, right?

73
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,170
A bird in the house after a death?

74
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,190
- I hate birds.
- I hate birds.

75
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,700
You, keep doing what
you're doing. Come with me.

76
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,880
Fbi called this morning.

77
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,060
They want to borrow a few lapd detectives
for a joint organized-crime task force.

78
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,560
I think you should do it.

79
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,080
Fbi?

80
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:38,390
You'd be on loan, still lapd,
for a few weeks here in L.A.

81
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,260
Looks great on the resume when you want
to move up the ladder, which you do.

82
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,880
Fbi.

83
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,120
When do I have to tell them?

84
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,290
- They need you there today.
- Well, what about the case?

85
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,410
The vic has a shelf full of girlfriends
and a broom handle through and through.

86
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,200
It's done. He'll be fine.

87
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,510
You should do this.

88
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,830
It's a new situation for you.

89
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,950
I want you think of it like
you're building a building.

90
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,880
You got to put in a good foundation, or everything
you do after that is just gonna come tumbling down.

91
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,740
I'll see you in a few weeks, crews.

92
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,090
Okay, but remember what I said--
good foundation right away.

93
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,620
Everything else after
that is just a waste.

94
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,050
And you got that speech in...

95
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,800
Kindergarten. But it's a good speech.

96
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,680
It's--it's the
foundation speech.

97
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,770
Oh, they grow up so fast, don't they?

98
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,370
Found this in the closet.

99
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,420
Wireless computer backup.

100
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,730
Everything on jerome rafts'
computers will be on here.

101
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,030
Reese usually starts.

102
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,190
Maybe you
could--

103
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,330
Why don't I just jump in?

104
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,070
Jerome rafts, 38 years old, moved from
north dakota nine years ago, works at home.

105
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,110
He's a financial advisor specializing in
derivative do you know what a derivative is?

106
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,540
A derivative is when you
don't invest in a thing,

107
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,510
but you kind of invest in a thing
like the thing you're investing in.

108
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,880
Yeah, me neither.

109
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,920
Tech guys couldn't bust open security on his
business files, so we don't know his clients yet.

110
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:25,950
Who are the girlfriends?

111
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,940
They're not exactly girlfriends.

112
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,040
Tech did find a file on each of
them in jerome rafts' computer--

113
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,590
hours spent with each girl
at a cost of $400 per hour.

114
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,360
Eight hours with
veronica-- $3,200.

115
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,840
Four hours with
harper-- $1,600.

116
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,380
13 hours with
trish-- $4,800.

117
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,940
$4,800 only gets you 12 hours.

118
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,470
I guess the 13th hour's
free, like doughnuts.

119
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,980
But the winner is alexa--
$9,600 over the last month.

120
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,520
What kind of guy displays photos of himself
with escorts like they were his girlfriends?

121
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,310
He's a financial advisor.

122
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,580
You know, his world is money.

123
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,140
You know, just because he paid for his
relationships, didn't make them any less real.

124
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,180
Don't you think this is weird?

125
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,850
You know, just us two without reese?

126
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,410
Let's just keep the ball moving.
Did rafts have date last night?

127
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,830
Yeah, with alexa.

128
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,450
Anything on the security cameras?

129
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,700
We got this.

130
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,400
Doesn't live in the building, wasn't
a guest of anyone in the building.

131
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,550
But she's looking down and away
from the camera. Could be anyone.

132
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,500
What did you do to that woman,
pal, that she'd do that to you?

133
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,480
Phone numbers on any of the girls?

134
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,680
We dumped rafts' phone, didn't
find any calls to the women.

135
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:43,350
We did find one call he made repeatedly
to a woman named brenda trill.

136
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,850
Every time rafts called
trill, rafts had a date.

137
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,700
- Brenda trill's the madam.
- I'm on my way to check her out now.

138
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,990
I guess you'll need someone to
fill in for reese while she's gone.

139
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:57,350
Captain, we--we both might need
someone to fill in for reese, and, um,

140
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,960
I want you to know you can,
uh, you can always talk to me.

141
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,490
Anything you-- you
want to talk about?

142
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,690
I'll go talk to the madam, then.

143
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,970
I-I know this doesn't
make me detective.

144
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,910
I'm still just a
patrolman in a cheap suit.

145
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,470
I'm happy to have you in the car.

146
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,660
Charlie, I wasn't exactly there for
you the last time we partnered, so...

147
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,830
hey, you want me out
of this car, I am out.

148
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,240
Bobby, I requested you.

149
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,900
I prayed for this. I'm not
ashamed to say, prayed...

150
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,550
for you and me to be in a car again.

151
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,160
I'm guessing you
prayed for other things.

152
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,990
Yeah, I did--
other things.

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,420
That dead guy sure did like the
pros, though, huh? All that money.

154
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,390
Yeah, don't think jerome rafts
had much else in his life.

155
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,390
Seems like the relationships he
paid for were the only ones he had.

156
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:57,780
That's so wrong. You don't pay a
pro to stay. You pay her to leave.

157
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,010
Charlie sheen said that.

158
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,560
"Jerome rafts--
financial advisor.

159
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,780
Risk acquisitions--
derivatives."

160
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,190
Do you know what a derivative is?

161
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,620
Sure, it's the kind of investment
where you're really not, um...

162
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,690
well, it's--it's--it's-- it's
when you're, uh... no. No, no idea.

163
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,040
Yes, I-I know what a derivative is.

164
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,870
It's--it's-- it's kind of
hard to explain to a layperson.

165
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,330
To a layperson, ted? Are you
saying I wouldn't understand it?

166
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,230
No, I'm saying it's complicated.

167
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,220
Okay, a derivative is a
financial product whose value

168
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,040
is derived from the value of
something else, the underlying.

169
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,960
Now, because the value of the derivative is
contingent on the value of the underlying,

170
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,030
the notional value of derivatives
is recorded off the balance sheet,

171
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,830
while the market value of derivatives
is recorded on the balance sheet.

172
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,860
I don't understand it.

173
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,920
Don't feel bad. No one does.

174
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,580
Uh, why do you need to know?

175
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,410
I got a dead financial advisor,
specialized in derivatives.

176
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:07,950
How broke was he?

177
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,940
Don't think he was broke. Why?

178
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,820
Well, the derivative bubble burst.

179
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,040
If the guy had money, it
was from somewhere else.

180
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,820
It came from somewhere else?

181
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,840
- Are you ted earley?
- Yes.

182
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,940
- And you are?
- Amanda.

183
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,900
How can I help you, amanda?

184
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,920
Well, actually, I'm interested
in taking your class, you know,

185
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,340
going back to school and all that.

186
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,470
Would it be all right if
I asked you some questions?

187
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,590
What's that going through him?

188
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,290
A broom handle.

189
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,110
He was with a girl
named alexa last night.

190
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,930
That's
right--alexa.

191
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,540
- Can we talk to her?
- You can try.

192
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,980
When she didn't check in after
her date, I called her cell.

193
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,270
It was no longer in service.

194
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,530
Do you have her address, then?

195
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:12,100
I don't know where any of my
girls live, for their own safety.

196
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,070
Are any of these alexa?

197
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,700
No.

198
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,020
Do you have a photo of her?

199
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,670
You mean like on her company I.D.?

200
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,930
I guess not.

201
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,590
We're gonna want you to
talk to a sketch artist.

202
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,890
Bobby... do you have a question
you'd like to ask of miss trill?

203
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,350
Yeah. Uh, sure, okay, uh...

204
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,380
Uh, let me see, uh...

205
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,880
do you know who killed jerome rafts?

206
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,610
No.

207
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,230
Probably want to work up to that one.

208
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,490
Give it another shot.

209
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,700
Can you tell us about the
other clients alexa dated?

210
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,510
Now, that's a great question.
Isn't that a great question?

211
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,580
Alexa didn't have any other clients.

212
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,660
Jerome was her first, and once he started with
her, he never dated any of the other girls.

213
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,620
How did the other girls take that?

214
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,250
You'll have to ask them.

215
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,160
Didn't bother me when
he went with alexa.

216
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,560
Busier than ever, actually.

217
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,990
Do you like jerome?

218
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,240
He was a real gentleman.

219
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,100
He always said,
"please," and "thank you."

220
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,910
Showered, too, and,
uh, soaped everywhere.

221
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,740
How did you spend your time together?

222
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,540
Oh, you know, we had fondue.

223
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,900
- Went whale-watching.
- He'd read to me.

224
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,480
For $400 an hour?

225
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,630
I'm worth it. Would
you like to read to me?

226
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,770
You seem a little
nervous, hon. First time?

227
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,870
I... usually do this in uniform.

228
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,690
Funny. Me too. Maybe you
should give me a call.

229
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,700
Uh, I'm married. Very, very married.

230
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,830
What about you, cutie?
Are you very married, too?

231
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,610
Yeah, married, yep.

232
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:03,650
- You are not married. - To
the law-- married to the law.

233
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,430
Well, call if she
gives you the night off.

234
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,940
Whale-watching, rollerblading,
reading? You and jerome did have sex?

235
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,200
Well, yes, but not until the third date.

236
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,800
He said we had to wait.

237
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,140
He was very old-fashioned that way.

238
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,610
Did he ever talk about his business?

239
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:23,550
I didn't really understand it.
He sold things that aren't there.

240
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,920
It's complicated for a layman.

241
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,490
A lay what?

242
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,280
Uh, did jerome, uh, always pay on time?

243
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,010
On time and in cash.

244
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,250
Tipped real well, too.

245
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,620
A lay what?

246
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,970
What did you talk about, then?

247
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,520
Mostly he would talk about his birds.

248
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,070
- His what?
- His birds.

249
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,770
Jerome could talk about
his pigeons for hours.

250
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:45,590
His pigeons.

251
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,630
Yeah, he was a little obsessed.

252
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,560
I think he might've spent more
money on them than he did on me.

253
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,610
Didn't you see them?

254
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,410
Yeah, I think I might have.

255
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,600
A lay what?

256
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,160
Don't understand keeping an animal
most people pay to exterminate.

257
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,740
Bobby, how come you
never see a baby pigeon?

258
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,430
You worked downtown all those
years. You ever see a baby pigeon?

259
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,470
You know, you're right.

260
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,070
Where the hell are all the baby pigeons?

261
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,910
Where do you think alexa is?

262
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,810
She killed jerome and took off.

263
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,140
Or she saw who killed
jerome and took off. Or...

264
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,340
- Or she's dead, too.
- Or she's dead, too.

265
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,610
But there was no picture
of rafts with alexa,

266
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,320
and alexa had her head turned away
from that camera in the elevator.

267
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,160
What's that mean?

268
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,410
Hey, you find that bird yet?

269
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,810
You have experience with a poly?

270
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,670
Uh, given it, never taken it.

271
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,620
This test is for your
security clearance.

272
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,760
The bureau needs to know your
secrets, what you're hiding,

273
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,280
so they can't be used
against you by others.

274
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,310
If we know your secrets, you
can't be blackmailed, can you?

275
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,220
If you wish not to take this test,
I can have an agent drive you home.

276
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:14,850
I have nothing to hide.

277
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,750
Then you would be the
first. Okay, section one.

278
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,740
Aren't you gonna turn the machine on?

279
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,680
It's been on. Section one--your
father's name is jack reese?

280
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,750
- Yes.
- He was an lapd cop?

281
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,910
Yes.

282
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,770
- Is this why you became a cop?
- No.

283
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,820
Yes. Yes.

284
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,810
To the best of your knowledge,
did your father ever break the law?

285
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,080
To the best of my knowledge, no.

286
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,750
We'll come back to this.

287
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,920
As a cop, uh, you did undercover work?

288
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,280
Yes.

289
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,610
- Involving narcotics?
- Yes.

290
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,180
- You yourself used narcotics.
- Yes.

291
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,610
You had a relationship
with one of your suspects?

292
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,300
Yes.

293
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,910
We'll come back to this.

294
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,740
So which one of you is ronnie
pollen, and which one of you is mitch?

295
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,560
Uh, I'm ronnie. This is mitch.

296
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,160
- It'd help if you didn't dress alike.
- Help what?

297
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:22,310
You want to explain why you
were found in a dead man's coop?

298
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,210
We're fanciers.

299
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,000
- Pigeon fanciers.
- Yeah.

300
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,050
You raise pigeons.

301
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,120
Yeah, man's been doing
it for 10,000 years.

302
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,850
Like for food? You eating them?

303
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,290
- No, we don't eat them.We show them.
- No. Yeah.

304
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,690
And why were you in rafts' coop?

305
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,540
Jerome rafts gave us a bad egg.

306
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,860
A-a bad what?

307
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,030
A bad egg. We bought an egg
supposedly out of bloody mary.

308
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,910
And that would be a bird.

309
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,850
- Yeah, one of rafts' prized birds.
- We took that egg in good faith.

310
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,720
Yeah, but when it hatched, we could clearly
see it was not bloody mary's offspring.

311
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,490
We were bamboozled.

312
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,280
Did you confront rafts with this?

313
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,350
- Yes, but he said the egg was true.
- But it was not true.

314
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,350
No.

315
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,200
- So you went to get a true egg.
- Yes.

316
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,140
And where were you last night?

317
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,340
In our own coop.

318
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,070
You live in a pigeon coop?

319
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,530
No, we have a coop behind our
house. We were tending it last night.

320
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,280
You ever seen rafts with this girl?

321
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,580
Alexa. His
girlfriend--so pretty.

322
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,380
- Very pretty.
- Yes, she is.

323
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,360
Anything else you can tell us about her?

324
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,700
- Well, she knew a lot about pigeons.
- Yeah.

325
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,010
She was a fancier, too?

326
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,830
Yeah, she knew her rollers, her trumpeters,
dragoons, flying tipplers, croppers...

327
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,080
Berlin short faced tumblers, too.

328
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,280
A pretty girl who knew her
berlin short faced tumblers.

329
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,730
Yeah.

330
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,720
Can I tell you the real reason
why I want to take your class?

331
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,560
No, I-I want you to lie to me.

332
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,740
You--you-- you
can't smoke in here.

333
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,230
You have got to promise me you won't think less of
me when I tell you why I want to take your class.

334
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,220
Okay, I-I promise.

335
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:09,370
Because every teacher I've ever had
my entire life was chock full of crap.

336
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,360
Shall I tell you why?

337
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,470
Uh, you-- you
can't smoke in here.

338
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,150
Because they knew nothing of the world.

339
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,030
I mean, they grew up in books,
but you know the world, mr. Earley.

340
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,620
I do.

341
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,900
And great heights and all the way down.

342
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,660
All the way down.

343
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,620
Prison, twice.

344
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:33,060
That is not a book, mr.
Earley. That is the world.

345
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,890
That's why I want to take your class.

346
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:41,740
Uh, you--you--you really
can't smoke in here.

347
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,860
Then let's go someplace where I can...

348
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,330
Smoke.

349
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:56,170
Tech support case number 78239847.

350
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,800
This is june. How may I help you?

351
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:00,170
It's india, isn't it? You're in india.

352
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,810
You know this call is monitored.

353
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,680
June, can I ask you a question?

354
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,470
Do you think two people can
be perfect for each other?

355
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,590
Sir,
I--

356
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,440
I usually talk these things
through with reese, but, uh...

357
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,030
well, I could talk to
stark, but, you know.

358
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,670
I don'T. I don't know this
reese. I don't know this stark.

359
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,080
I do know you need to have a technical
issue if you wish to continue this call.

360
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,380
Okay, technically, don't you think
it's amazing that I'm here in L.A.

361
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:30,320
And you're in, let's say, india, giving
me tech support for my phone made in china?

362
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,170
But I am not giving you tech support.

363
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,410
So now I'm hanging up, sir.

364
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,020
It is india, isn't it?

365
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,370
And I bet your name isn't june.

366
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,320
We opened the business file
on rafts' computer. Guess what.

367
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,190
They're empty? That bubble burst.

368
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,620
I don't know how he made his
money, but it wasn't derivatives.

369
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,650
No bank records either. Nothing.

370
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,370
So how was rafts making his
money to pay for those women?

371
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,430
And where was he keeping it?

372
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,870
If it was drugs, his
prints aren't in the system.

373
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,150
Where are you with the escort?

374
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:01,360
All we got is this sketch.

375
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,790
Got to sit somewhere.

376
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,500
They were perfect for each other.

377
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,290
Jerome rafts and alexa.

378
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,640
You ever meet the perfect girl?

379
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,540
When you were sober?

380
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:29,870
So we don't know how rafts earned his
money, but we know alexa knew her pigeons.

381
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,280
So what are the odds that a
beautiful escort into pigeons

382
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,760
gets hired by a rich
john also into pigeons?

383
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,380
When you say it like that, I got
to put it at a billion-to-none.

384
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:48,170
Antifreeze, ammonia, bleach,
broom handle, cut phone cords.

385
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,380
We thought it was
rage-- an angry woman.

386
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,520
- What else could it be?
- What if it were reason?

387
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,320
She knew those birds, bobby.

388
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:02,060
She took time to work out
what jerome rafts liked.

389
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,790
You know a woman who would take that
kind of time and then come in here

390
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,040
and give herself over to rage to anger?

391
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,310
She took time.

392
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,060
What would she have done if
he hadn't dropped that wine?

393
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,270
What would she have done if
he hadn't dropped that wine?

394
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,660
What, fry him in the tub? No way.

395
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:52,480
I got an electrician cousin assured me these
gfci outlets trip the circuit in 1/30 of a second.

396
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,990
Can't kill a man that way no more.

397
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,990
Looks like something's in there.

398
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,970
Looks like nail polish.

399
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:11,490
Ammonia, antifreeze,
bleach, a broom handle...

400
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,370
nail polish.

401
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,290
Ooh,charlie,don't
you--

402
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:30,080
I guess she really was a pro.

403
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,790
A hit man?

404
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,250
Uh,woman.

405
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,990
Hit man woman. Hit woman.

406
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,280
A paid professional killer.

407
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,830
And you think this because there
was nail polish in the outlet?

408
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,730
That and because of a dead gun
company whistle blower in fresno.

409
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,410
Loose balcony rail--
ten-floor dive.

410
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,630
A dead D.E.A.Informant in oakland.

411
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,520
Found hung by the cord
of the window blinds.

412
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,650
And a dead labor leader in indio.

413
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,690
Rat poison in his frijoles.

414
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,650
No knives,no guns-- uses only things
everyone leaves around the house,

415
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,940
never leaves any fingerprints,no dna.

416
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,430
A hit man.

417
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,090
Hit man woman.

418
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,010
What makes you think it was her?

419
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,820
Caught on camera leaving the
labor leader's motel in indio.

420
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,590
And what else do we know?

421
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,520
All we really know
is what we don't know.

422
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,270
We don't know how jerome
rafts earned all his money,

423
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,560
so we don't know why she killed him,so
we don't know who hired her to kill him.

424
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,390
We don't know who she is,where
she is,or where she came from.

425
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:26,590
Then again,neither do the police
in indio,oakland,or fresno.

426
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,220
One thing we do know they didn't know...

427
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,100
we know she knew her pigeons.

428
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:41,420
If I want to learn about
pigeons,who would I get to teach me?

429
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,900
Do you want to learn about pigeons?

430
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,860
Answer the question,bird boy.

431
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:51,880
Well,in the world of L.A."Pigeondom," there's
about,uh,about a dozen master fanciers.

432
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,100
We're gonna need their names.

433
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,250
I have a sketch I'd like to show them.

434
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,640
She was
polite,well-dressed,soft-spoken.

435
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,250
She asked many questions,and
she listened to each answer.

436
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,560
She sat right on the edge of her chair.

437
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,710
Perched?

438
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,350
Yes.

439
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,690
Very lightly.

440
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:12,200
Did she reveal anything personal about
herself-- where she lived,her friends?

441
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:16,890
No,she kept herself to
herself,much like a pigeon,really.

442
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,650
Like the berlin short-faced tumbler?

443
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,470
No,more like
the archangel--

444
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,750
narrow tail,moderately wide and slightly
pronounced breast,long,thin neck,

445
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,430
and the eyes--utterly
vivid eyes.

446
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,300
She really liked these birds?

447
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,820
Yes,which is why I was surprised
when the one I sold her came back.

448
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,910
Came back?

449
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,690
Last week,it was back in the pen.

450
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,170
You--you sure it
was her pigeon?

451
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,100
It's not like they all
look alike,you know?

452
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,260
Why would a pigeon come back?

453
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,130
If it didn't feel cared
for,which is why I was surprised.

454
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:55,350
I really thought her
affections were...honest.

455
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,430
Where would that bird go if
you stopped caring for it?

456
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,610
But why would I stop caring for it?

457
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,920
Well--well,I suppose it
would do what any of us would.

458
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,310
Return to a familiar place.

459
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,050
Your partner spent time in prison.

460
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,260
Has he talked about this time?

461
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,600
Yes.

462
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,920
And what did he say?

463
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,670
Uh,he said he kne a transvestite named
angel who made a great carrot cake.

464
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,630
Okay.

465
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,770
Did he talk to you about
why he was sent to prison?

466
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,430
No.

467
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,400
Do you know who mickey rayborn is?

468
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,790
Exactly what kind of
security clearance is this?

469
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,930
No food or water,hmm?

470
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:52,190
You're a tough bird.

471
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,370
I would've broke by now.

472
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,840
Everybody breaks,bobby.

473
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:57,250
You got to know that going in.

474
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:06,840
The bird and I will both eat
once the killer has been caught.

475
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,960
I've been a cop a long time.

476
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,700
Seen women kill for a lot of reasons.

477
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,560
You ever see one kill
because it's her job?

478
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:18,280
No,sir,that I have not.

479
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,780
Well,let's go see what one looks like.

480
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,610
How'd that guy describe her breast?

481
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,000
"Slightly pronounced."

482
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:34,590
Yeah,I wish he hadn't said that.

483
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,310
Pull over here.

484
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,520
That the pigeon in that tree there?

485
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:52,220
I guess so,but I got to tell
you-- they all look alike to me.

486
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,890
Well,according to this,it's that house.

487
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,660
Is that her?

488
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,220
What's that in her hand,charlie?

489
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:09,410
That,bobby,is a broom.

490
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,250
Alexa.

491
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,240
Alexa?

492
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,560
Uh,no,sorry.

493
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,910
My name's claudia.

494
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,080
Is there an alexa who lives here?

495
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,520
No,there's not.

496
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,410
Just you,then?

497
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,700
And you are?

498
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,520
Lapd.

499
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:33,920
We're looking for an alexa who has
a real interest in raising pigeons.

500
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:38,330
Well,sorry to disappoint,but my
name's claudia,and I'm a personal chef.

501
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:42,980
So I-I could cook you a
pigeon,but I-I can't raise one.

502
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,740
What has this pigeon-raiser done?

503
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,320
We just want to ask her a few questions.

504
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,360
We think she's a contract killer.

505
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,200
A contract...

506
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,120
A hit man...woman.

507
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,180
Hit woman.

508
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,980
Raises birds and kills people.

509
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,380
Gets paid for it,too.

510
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,670
Just the killing people part.

511
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,100
We'd just like to
clear you as a suspect.

512
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,220
It's a procedural thing.

513
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,810
Would you mind coming with us?

514
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,300
Let me get my bag.

515
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:25,850
Wow,big purse.

516
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,440
What's in it?

517
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,540
This and that,women's things.

518
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,600
I like to be prepared.

519
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,260
Is that your car?

520
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:40,750
Is it undercover?

521
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:45,360
It's not undercover,but it's unmarked.

522
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,460
This is exciting.

523
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,450
I've never been in a police car before.

524
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,550
You sure about that?

525
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,660
I think I'd remember.

526
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,450
Does it have a siren?

527
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,000
Can we use it?

528
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,570
None of you recognize her as alexa?

529
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,950
There's a resemblance...

530
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,100
but I can't say it's her for sure.

531
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,510
Take another look.

532
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,440
You must understand,I
only met with alexa once.

533
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:37,110
She had short,dark hair and makeup.

534
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,280
The rest of the time
we spoke on the phone.

535
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,600
What about you?

536
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,860
Oh,I agree with,um,the lady.

537
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,740
I mean,she resembles alexa,but
I couldn't say for sure.

538
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,010
I mean,she seems so different.

539
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,500
Oh,come on.

540
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,700
What about the vivid eyes,the
slightly pronounced breast?

541
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,520
No,the eyes are vivid,but
the breast is less pronounced.

542
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:01,660
To tell true,I-I have a tough
time telling humans apart.

543
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,100
What about you two?

544
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,820
Well,she looks kind of the same,but...

545
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,360
She seems like a different girl.

546
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,490
- Different but the same.
- Same but different.

547
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,800
- Same but different.
- Different but the same.

548
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,690
This was fun.

549
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,240
I like to try everything once.

550
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,640
Well,you can cross that off your list.

551
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,350
I can do just that,detective.

552
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,530
Would you like a ride home?

553
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,290
No,I'll take the bus.

554
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,170
If you ever need any
chefing,you know where I am.

555
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,050
I grabbed these before I left the house.

556
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,560
They're homemade.

557
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,820
You two looked hungry.

558
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,270
Oh,it looks tasty.

559
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,450
What's in it?

560
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,120
Just stuff I had around the house.

561
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,860
Probably shouldn't eat that.

562
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,890
Probably not.

563
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,630
I hope you're not hungry.

564
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,680
There's some leftovers in the
fridge,but I don't know what they are--

565
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,250
meat,cheese,some of charlie's evidence.

566
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,510
He's a-a cop,so he has evidence.

567
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:16,970
He doesn't bring it home,though,so
I-I don't really think it's his,uh...

568
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:18,930
amanda?

569
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,430
Amanda?

570
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,350
Amanda?

571
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,000
I thought you ducked out for a smoke.

572
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,950
I-I went looking for the loo,actually.

573
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,320
The loo?

574
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,540
Oh,the bathroom.

575
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,790
Yeah,I know.

576
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,860
Tell me again why you
wanted to take my class.

577
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:03,320
You think you can tell who a person
is just by looking in their eyes?

578
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:08,110
That's a strange question to ask a woman who spends
her life talking to people she will never meet.

579
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,220
Yeah,I guess it is.

580
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,260
The buddha was born in india,you know.

581
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,130
Nepal...

582
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,190
what is now nepal.

583
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,160
May I ask-- what
are you looking for?

584
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,450
Right now?

585
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:20,660
A killer.

586
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,250
You're here alone?

587
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,230
I am.

588
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,320
How come you're here alone?

589
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,600
I'm looking for some chefing.

590
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:49,520
I can do any number from two to 200,and I can make
the menu for you,or you can just tell me what you like.

591
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,150
No,thank you.

592
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,550
A little wine won't kill you.

593
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,020
I'm driving.

594
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,320
Suit yourself.

595
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,810
Maybe I could do a lamb.

596
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,670
Is it an afternoon or an evening event?

597
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,690
You must look very different
when you're working.

598
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,740
No,not really.

599
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:24,680
Maybe a nicer apron,sometimes
that silly,little hat.

600
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,100
I'd think with the intensity
it takes to do your work that,

601
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:32,540
uh,when you're on the job,it'd
be hard to recognize you.

602
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,630
I suppose sometimes I can get intense.

603
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,470
When you're on the job.

604
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:47,230
Yes,but here in my kitchen,just
me and my knives,it's calming.

605
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,390
Do you cook,detective?

606
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,380
No.

607
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,890
I bet you'd be real good at it.

608
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,530
You're very good with a knife.

609
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,680
I've had some practice.

610
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,670
But not cooking.

611
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:15,900
No.

612
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:20,690
You work alone?

613
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,980
Yes.

614
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,210
I like to have a partner...

615
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,090
someone to watch your back.

616
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,360
Are you sure you don't want some wine?

617
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,650
I could go for a diet
soda if you got it.

618
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:38,940
Diet soda?

619
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:40,130
Really?

620
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,950
You--you don't look
like the diet soda type.

621
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,520
Well,looks,you know,deceiving.

622
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,560
The coroner found no
skin under rafts' nails.

623
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,390
Your chef didn't get that
scratch from the victim.

624
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,930
How you doing without reese?

625
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,380
Maybe you should talk to someone.

626
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,650
Maybe you should talk to someone.

627
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,680
Oh,I am-- a woman
from tech support.

628
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,180
You're talking to a woman
from lapd tech support?

629
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,000
No,for the bluetooth in my car.

630
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,610
Still,it seems to be helping.

631
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,410
I can give you her number.

632
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,830
Captain.

633
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,620
We got human skin under
a few of the claws.

634
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,990
Uh,male and female is all we
can tell here in the field.

635
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,260
If we put her with one of
those human female samples,

636
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:37,750
we match her to the victim,but
it's not enough to indict.

637
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,650
She does what she does 'cause
no one knows she's doing it.

638
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:45,050
She knows that we know she's doing what she's
doing,she's got to do something else,hasn't she?

639
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,930
You want a dna warrant?

640
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,440
You still see her?

641
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,620
She's still here.

642
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,870
She's just been puttering
around the house.

643
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,440
Girl sure likes to putter.

644
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,960
Tidwell got us a warrant for her dna.

645
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,970
I'm on my way to serve it now.

646
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,980
Hey,bobby.

647
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,480
Wait for me to get there.

648
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,820
Sure,charlie.

649
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,550
How'd you find me?

650
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,910
Pigeon-- you
threw it away.

651
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,230
I should've killed that bird.

652
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,770
It's gonna be okay.

653
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,400
No,detective,it's not gonna be okay.

654
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,200
I'm not a detective.

655
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:48,360
I'm just-- Here,I
made this myself.

656
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,780
No!Spit it out.

657
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,630
Spit it out!

658
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,980
I'm gonna miss living at the beach.

659
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,150
Really liked all the light.

660
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,370
How does it feel?

661
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,710
I made it from mushrooms
I grew under my sink.

662
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:41,590
Paralysis first-- muscular,then neural,then
the organs-- the lungs,the heart,the brain.

663
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,490
But you'll be dead before that.

664
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:56,000
You know,most people underestimate the
value of things found in their own home.

665
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,280
Not me,though.

666
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,440
Picked this up on my last job.

667
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,600
Think I'm gonna work it into the act.

668
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,870
What do you think?

669
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,880
You know,that man just wouldn't die.

670
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,140
Okay...

671
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,520
I'll be going now.

672
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:37,650
Officer needs help.

673
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,060
Hold on there,bobby.

674
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,050
Just one person traveling.

675
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,550
Yes.

676
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,080
First class.

677
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:17,050
Yeah,uh,I-I'll pay the penalty.

678
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,420
Yes,cash.

679
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,400
Oh,you're--you're gonna
have to hold on a minute.

680
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,590
You know it's against the law
to talk on the phone like that?

681
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,130
If you want to go hands-free,I
got someone you can talk to.

682
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,410
You did this to my car.

683
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,140
Diet soda in the gas tank.

684
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,200
Just something you had
lying around the house.

685
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,450
Probably kill me with these.

686
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,370
I never met a woman who
killed because it was her job.

687
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,940
Guess you can cross that
off your list,detective.

688
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,290
I guess I can.

689
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,190
Why'd you kill jerome rafts?

690
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,710
I'm just a chef,detective.

691
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,870
You have me confused with someone else.

692
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,220
A hit man woman?

693
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:11,000
Yep,a hit man woman.

694
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,610
And stark's gonna be okay?

695
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,380
We jacked him full of epinephrine.

696
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,140
He won't be eating any mushrooms.

697
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:18,670
And you still don't know
why she killed jerome rafts?

698
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,220
Crews?

699
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:23,190
You're doing it,aren't you?

700
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,140
You're staring at something.

701
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:27,870
And now you're taking
out some fruit,right?

702
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,480
What do you see,crews?

703
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:31,870
Crews?

704
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,710
That's a lot of birdseed.

705
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,540
Hey,pigeons don't eat that much,do they?

706
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,290
I mean,they eat like a bird,right?

707
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,580
That's a lot of birdseed.

708
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,300
He was the competition.

709
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,800
He was a hit man.

710
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,880
Traced that rifle to six assassinations.

711
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,300
But,you know,we're in a down cycle,

712
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:57,200
so there just wasn't enough
business for the both of them.

713
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,040
Sir,are you telling me
these things hands-free?

714
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,530
Yes,I am.

715
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,440
Then I shall close this case file.

716
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,480
Your name isn't june,is it?

717
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:10,580
No,it is deepa.

718
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,910
It was a pleasure talking to you,deepa.

719
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,290
It was a pleasure talking
to you,detective crews.
