1
00:00:05,828 --> 00:00:08,629
- Maybe it's not real.
- It's real.

2
00:00:08,697 --> 00:00:12,481
Fakes are easy. Any kid with a
computer and a printer can do it.

3
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:14,702
It's not a fake.

4
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,271
This girl i knew sent me
a picture of herself once.

5
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:18,773
She had this devil tail.

6
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:20,975
It looked real, but it wasn't.

7
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:23,583
Ted, i had that photo
checked. It's real.

8
00:00:23,703 --> 00:00:25,780
It's reese with rayborn

9
00:00:25,848 --> 00:00:28,964
three days before someone spilled
his blood all over his boat.

10
00:00:29,084 --> 00:00:32,401
Well, what are you going to
do? You gotta do something.

11
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:35,886
Do you want me to do something? I can
do something. You gotta do something.

12
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:37,653
Don't you?

13
00:00:40,662 --> 00:00:42,800
I'm going to work.

14
00:00:59,798 --> 00:01:03,198
- Nice tat. Where'd you get it?
- Your mother gave it to me.

15
00:01:03,318 --> 00:01:06,353
Yeah? My mother didn't
do time in atwater.

16
00:01:06,422 --> 00:01:08,486
What do you know about atwater?

17
00:01:08,606 --> 00:01:10,676
Atwater's a cakewalk.

18
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,597
Compared to what?

19
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:18,499
Crescent city.

20
00:01:29,177 --> 00:01:33,075
Pelican bay crescent city?
You don't seem like no guard.

21
00:01:33,195 --> 00:01:35,119
Wasn't no guard.

22
00:01:40,348 --> 00:01:43,758
You were in pelican bay? No way.

23
00:01:43,826 --> 00:01:46,081
Where do you think i learned this?

24
00:01:50,128 --> 00:01:53,073
- What years?
- '94 to '06.

25
00:01:53,193 --> 00:01:55,703
Atwater. '98 to '08.

26
00:01:55,823 --> 00:01:58,821
- Oh, we got a dead woman upstairs.
- I know.

27
00:01:59,428 --> 00:02:02,509
- Got her blood on your boots.
- I know.

28
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:15,380
Is one of you charlie crews?

29
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,876
I am. Who wants to know?

30
00:02:17,996 --> 00:02:21,634
Jane seever. Detective jane seever.

31
00:02:22,764 --> 00:02:24,585
Your new partner.

32
00:02:25,066 --> 00:02:27,369
Wanna switch places?

33
00:02:31,066 --> 00:02:33,157
Life 218 : "3 Women"

34
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:35,357
Synchro : Flolo Transcript : Yyets.net

35
00:02:43,042 --> 00:02:45,739
he was hiding out on the bathroom ledge?

36
00:02:45,807 --> 00:02:47,007
Not at first.

37
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:49,524
He was with the body when he
heard the uniforms down the hall.

38
00:02:49,644 --> 00:02:51,378
He lives here.

39
00:02:51,445 --> 00:02:54,529
- And then he went out on the ledge?
- Yes, but it was too far to jump.

40
00:02:54,649 --> 00:02:57,131
So he climbed back in and tried
to walk right out the front door?

41
00:02:57,251 --> 00:02:59,290
Yes, most escapees just walk right out.

42
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,203
- But you followed him.
- Saw the blood on his boots.

43
00:03:02,323 --> 00:03:04,124
And he stopped walking and he ran.

44
00:03:04,192 --> 00:03:06,942
- He ran because he killed her?
- Well, screams were his.

45
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,878
- Which screams?
- The screams the neighbors heard.

46
00:03:09,998 --> 00:03:12,116
They heard a man. Not a woman.

47
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:14,910
Place was a mess when the unis got here.

48
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:17,537
Someone tossed it.

49
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:20,240
Why were you holding that knife?

50
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,042
Dropped my gun.

51
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,061
So why didn't you just pick
it up? You know what, stop.

52
00:03:26,181 --> 00:03:28,167
Can we... can we start again?

53
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:31,043
Okay, he was on the bathroom ledge.

54
00:03:31,163 --> 00:03:33,553
Oh, no, no, before that.

55
00:03:33,621 --> 00:03:37,074
- Hi, i'm detective seever.
- I'm detective crews.

56
00:03:37,194 --> 00:03:39,803
It is an honor to meet you.

57
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:44,201
Okay.

58
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:47,534
But just to be clear, you're not.

59
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,236
- Not what?
- My new partner.

60
00:03:49,303 --> 00:03:52,020
- I have a partner. Two partners.
- Of course you do.

61
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,307
Officer robert stark
and detective dani reese.

62
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:57,191
- Did a little studying.
- Oh, like to be prepared.

63
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:59,747
Measure twice. Cut once.

64
00:03:59,814 --> 00:04:02,675
You know, i actually only got serious
about being prepared in law school.

65
00:04:02,795 --> 00:04:06,298
- Law school.
- Yes, it's part of my plan.

66
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:10,038
- Which plan is that? - My
15-year plan. To be mayor.

67
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:13,374
- Mayor.
- Law school first.

68
00:04:13,494 --> 00:04:16,745
Then detective. Then chief
of police. Then mayor.

69
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:20,849
- How's that going so far?
- You know, i mean, i got sidetracked,

70
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,437
you know, a few years back,
but i'm back on course now.

71
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:28,141
- Went through a dark time?
- No, no, olympics.

72
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:31,192
I mean, just the relay,
but, still, it took time.

73
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,846
Olympics.

74
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:36,430
- Just the relay.
- 15-year plan.

75
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,805
Yeah, you got one?

76
00:04:39,294 --> 00:04:41,688
No, not exactly.

77
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,350
You spent a lot of time in prison, john.

78
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,633
Armed robbery. That
jewelry store in 1997.

79
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:56,384
- You got out last year. Now this.
- I know what it looks like.

80
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:59,387
- Yeah, it looks like you killed her.
- Yeah, 'cause her blood was on me.

81
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,845
Well, that, and you being there and
suddenly not wanting to be there.

82
00:05:03,544 --> 00:05:05,482
Sally murdoch.

83
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,088
This girl had a job at a news station.

84
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,784
This girl paid her taxes.

85
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,760
This girl had pretty
dresses in her closet.

86
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,823
Pretty smile on her face.

87
00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:18,666
She was dead when i got there.

88
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,556
Look, the place was torn up.

89
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:27,226
I found her, i was holding
her, i heard those cops.

90
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:29,978
I know what it looks like.

91
00:05:30,098 --> 00:05:31,772
Yeah, but what were
you doing there, john?

92
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:34,942
What's a convict like you
doing in a pretty girl's loft?

93
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:36,443
You know you shouldn't be there, right.

94
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,745
You're not supposed to touch that stuff.

95
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:40,714
She wanted me there.

96
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:44,498
- Where did you meet a girl like this?
- She wrote me when i was in atwater.

97
00:05:44,618 --> 00:05:47,468
- I wrote her back.
- She just decided to write you.

98
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:50,891
- You never met her before.
- Nope.

99
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,847
I got out a few months ago.

100
00:05:54,195 --> 00:05:56,660
We started seeing each other.

101
00:05:57,062 --> 00:05:59,499
Look, i was at the movies last night.

102
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:03,404
- Anybody with you?
- I was by myself. I like to do that.

103
00:06:03,524 --> 00:06:07,029
Okay, so this girl just decides
she has to write a convict

104
00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:10,324
- and picks you.
- Lots of girls do it.

105
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,369
- Lots of girls do it?
- Lots of girls do it.

106
00:06:18,234 --> 00:06:21,185
Can we talk outside for a minute?

107
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:37,938
- What?
- You're one of them, huh?

108
00:06:38,006 --> 00:06:41,856
Come on, john. Those girls on
the outside send those letters.

109
00:06:41,976 --> 00:06:45,445
You're that guy. The
one who writes back.

110
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:49,082
I posted my name. She wrote me.

111
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,092
Looking for what, john?

112
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:53,086
Looking to save someone.

113
00:06:53,154 --> 00:06:56,623
Looking to find the sensitive
soul inside the convict.

114
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,753
She liked you on the page, john.
How'd she like you in the bedroom?

115
00:07:01,405 --> 00:07:03,395
I didn't kill her.

116
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:05,720
You write her every day?

117
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,700
Like she was the one you needed?

118
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:09,202
Yeah.

119
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,327
The only one you needed?

120
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,518
But she wasn't, was she?

121
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:20,599
- How many others were there?
- One.

122
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:23,827
I only wrote one other woman.

123
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,607
Every day?

124
00:07:27,276 --> 00:07:30,129
Like she was the one you needed?

125
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:33,326
Like she was the only
one you needed, huh.

126
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:38,261
You stop writing her after you got out?

127
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:41,109
- You ever go see her after you got out?
- No.

128
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:45,010
- How'd she take that?
- How the do you think she took it?

129
00:07:56,136 --> 00:07:58,618
How do you know me?

130
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,672
Because.

131
00:08:01,178 --> 00:08:03,281
You're that guy.

132
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:09,527
Yup.

133
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:20,273
Hey, john, what's your handicap?

134
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:23,181
- What?
- Golf. What's your handicap?

135
00:08:24,028 --> 00:08:25,740
Three.

136
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,557
This guy?

137
00:08:33,677 --> 00:08:36,237
Sally never mentioned this guy.

138
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:39,240
- He said they were together.
- Well, if they were,

139
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,380
she never told anyone in the office.

140
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,645
Well, he said she wrote him
every day he was in prison.

141
00:08:44,765 --> 00:08:47,888
- And he killed her?
- How long did sally work here, sam?

142
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:49,536
Three years now.

143
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:52,280
- And what did she do?
- Closed captioning for the deaf.

144
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,241
You know, for when you
hit the mute button,

145
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:57,998
she's the one that typed it
in. She was real good at it too.

146
00:08:58,118 --> 00:09:01,284
- And how well did you know her?
- I was her boss.

147
00:09:01,404 --> 00:09:03,257
We'd have lunch.

148
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:07,197
Sally wasn't the kind of person
to get involved with a convict.

149
00:09:07,317 --> 00:09:09,294
What kind of person was she?

150
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:11,094
A nice person.

151
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:13,743
But now she's dead.

152
00:09:22,282 --> 00:09:24,404
So what's she like?

153
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:28,445
She's just a regular detective.

154
00:09:29,047 --> 00:09:30,547
Yes...

155
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:33,913
- Yeah.
- Regular?

156
00:09:33,981 --> 00:09:35,625
How regular?

157
00:09:36,082 --> 00:09:37,596
Regular.

158
00:09:37,716 --> 00:09:39,586
Regular regular.

159
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:46,426
Yes, yes, that's exactly what i mean.

160
00:09:46,494 --> 00:09:49,877
- They give you a partner?
- No. I'm working on my own.

161
00:09:49,997 --> 00:09:53,081
Perfect. All right. Great. Thank you.

162
00:09:53,605 --> 00:09:56,067
Oh, anything interesting?

163
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,800
Not really.

164
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:06,318
You know the feds. It's
just a bunch of paperwork.

165
00:10:06,438 --> 00:10:08,215
Paperwork?

166
00:10:10,784 --> 00:10:12,305
Yeah.

167
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:14,490
Yeah, lots of it.

168
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:17,690
I should go.

169
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,569
Settling in?

170
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:31,738
Yeah, i checked out the movie

171
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:34,717
flowers said he was at last night.
It played when he said it did.

172
00:10:34,837 --> 00:10:38,092
No staff remembers seeing him, so
that doesn't prove anything either way.

173
00:10:38,212 --> 00:10:42,106
A search of sally murdoch and john
flowers's place hasn't turned up any letters.

174
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:44,284
He still swears they wrote each other.

175
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,617
Prisons keep track of that?

176
00:10:46,737 --> 00:10:49,256
Prisons barely keep
track of their prisoners.

177
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:51,090
- We should...
- Already done.

178
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:53,621
I located the other woman that
flowers said he corresponded with.

179
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:56,067
Oh, and i got you this.

180
00:10:56,187 --> 00:10:57,899
I think that's how you like it.

181
00:11:00,168 --> 00:11:03,496
- It is. Five sugars. How'd you know?
- She likes to be prepared.

182
00:11:03,616 --> 00:11:06,683
I asked around, and no one knew
what you liked. I guessed tea.

183
00:11:06,803 --> 00:11:08,525
We should go.

184
00:11:08,645 --> 00:11:11,232
Traffic's going to be
getting bad soon, so...

185
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:17,417
- Not reese.
- Not reese.

186
00:11:17,485 --> 00:11:20,077
Definitely not reese.

187
00:11:20,197 --> 00:11:23,171
Okay, at the crime scene you
said they were his screams.

188
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,957
You wrote down what i said?

189
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:27,075
- I write down a lot of things.
- Part of your plan?

190
00:11:27,195 --> 00:11:29,629
Yes. Why ask his handicap?

191
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:31,464
You write that down too?

192
00:11:31,532 --> 00:11:32,999
But you weren't even in the room.

193
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,577
I was watching from the monitor.

194
00:11:34,697 --> 00:11:37,525
And about you walking me
out of the room like that...

195
00:11:37,645 --> 00:11:39,756
a very effective technique.

196
00:11:39,876 --> 00:11:42,153
I mean, do you use that a lot or...

197
00:11:43,938 --> 00:11:47,214
okay, the screams being his.

198
00:11:47,281 --> 00:11:50,049
Maybe they came in after,
maybe they were just grief,

199
00:11:50,117 --> 00:11:52,220
but why ask his handicap?

200
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:56,001
The jewelry store heist
that flowers went away for?

201
00:11:56,121 --> 00:11:59,006
- What job did he do on that crew?
- He broke open the safe.

202
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:02,610
Safecrackers typically have a
healthy respect for their tools.

203
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,392
A golfer as good as he is does not...

204
00:12:05,512 --> 00:12:07,500
take a 3-iron to someone's head.

205
00:12:07,568 --> 00:12:09,536
And don't write down what i say.

206
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,672
Do not write that down.

207
00:12:13,638 --> 00:12:16,931
Look, i know i'm not your partner.

208
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:19,088
Okay?

209
00:12:25,743 --> 00:12:28,531
There's no organized crime task force.

210
00:12:28,651 --> 00:12:30,156
You brought me here for this.

211
00:12:30,224 --> 00:12:32,406
No, there is an organized
crime task force.

212
00:12:32,526 --> 00:12:34,676
And this is part of it.

213
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:41,505
Okay, where's your father, detective?

214
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,804
He left your mother, took off.

215
00:12:44,872 --> 00:12:47,307
That's what the note said, yes?

216
00:12:53,726 --> 00:12:56,889
We're not asking you
to be a rat, detective.

217
00:12:57,585 --> 00:12:59,190
Just a cop.

218
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,154
I know this is hard.

219
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:04,023
But there are some things
you need to believe.

220
00:13:15,715 --> 00:13:20,273
Every day, five pages, ten pages.

221
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,074
For five years.

222
00:13:22,142 --> 00:13:24,377
Thousands of pages.

223
00:13:24,445 --> 00:13:27,947
Millions of his words
he poured up into me.

224
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,383
They went right up into me.

225
00:13:30,451 --> 00:13:33,250
I'd never been filled like that before.

226
00:13:33,511 --> 00:13:35,674
What was it about him?

227
00:13:35,794 --> 00:13:37,791
His need.

228
00:13:38,154 --> 00:13:41,447
Was raw. And hot.

229
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:44,578
His need for what?

230
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:47,698
To connect.

231
00:13:48,469 --> 00:13:50,583
He filled me all the way up.

232
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:54,534
It was like a wire
humming up inside of me.

233
00:13:55,544 --> 00:13:57,941
And after he got out?

234
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:01,375
I assumed he was strong.

235
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:05,318
He stopped writing. He
could stand on his own.

236
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:08,818
But he wasn't standing on his own.

237
00:14:10,524 --> 00:14:15,495
He was standing with her,
amy. He wrote her too.

238
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,566
Poured his words up
into her. Filled her up.

239
00:14:19,633 --> 00:14:22,068
- I knew he was with her.
- You wanted him too.

240
00:14:22,135 --> 00:14:25,131
- I wanted him to be happy.
- Is that how you felt then?

241
00:14:25,251 --> 00:14:28,424
A man does that to me,
i kneecap him or her.

242
00:14:28,544 --> 00:14:30,191
I was angry.

243
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:32,812
But it was selfish.

244
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,006
It was just about me.

245
00:14:37,348 --> 00:14:39,875
And i'm not angry now.

246
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:50,629
Amy, is that john up there?

247
00:14:51,672 --> 00:14:53,059
Yes.

248
00:14:53,336 --> 00:14:54,836
It is.

249
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:57,591
You've made him into a saint.

250
00:14:58,211 --> 00:15:00,764
The lowest of us are.

251
00:15:00,884 --> 00:15:03,062
Where were you last night, amy?

252
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:04,477
Here.

253
00:15:04,545 --> 00:15:06,646
With my lord.

254
00:15:07,361 --> 00:15:11,535
John didn't write or call
you after he was released.

255
00:15:11,655 --> 00:15:13,486
How about after we arrested him?

256
00:15:13,554 --> 00:15:15,968
- He call you then?
- No.

257
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,558
I guess he didn't need me.

258
00:15:20,123 --> 00:15:21,867
Thanks.

259
00:15:25,617 --> 00:15:28,000
She'd do anything for flowers.

260
00:15:28,068 --> 00:15:30,703
If flowers didn't call
her after we arrested him,

261
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:32,677
who did he call?

262
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:37,358
Okay, got it. After we arrested flowers,

263
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,528
he made a phone call, lasted six seconds.
The number belongs to a nina fiske.

264
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:44,066
- You get nina's address?
- Yeah. This you can write down.

265
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:03,770
I don't wanna die!

266
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,386
I'm not ready to die!

267
00:16:06,705 --> 00:16:09,623
I don't want to die!

268
00:16:10,377 --> 00:16:13,696
I'm not ready. I'm not ready to die.

269
00:16:13,816 --> 00:16:15,587
I don't wanna die.

270
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:18,451
I don't want to die.

271
00:16:44,993 --> 00:16:46,819
We're taking a break.

272
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,115
And i'm having a piss.

273
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,466
This is a play you've written?

274
00:16:59,534 --> 00:17:01,902
- Yes.
- About prison?

275
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,419
It's about redemption. It
just takes place in prison.

276
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:07,958
Are there any jokes in it? You
should put some jokes in it.

277
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:10,588
You write anything else, nina?

278
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:14,159
- Like what?
- Like letters to john flowers.

279
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:17,566
When he was in prison. We
know john called you, nina,

280
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:20,704
after he got busted. The
call lasted six seconds.

281
00:17:20,824 --> 00:17:24,483
Someone hang up on
somebody? You hang up on him?

282
00:17:24,603 --> 00:17:26,927
John and i wrote to each
other every day for years.

283
00:17:26,995 --> 00:17:29,734
He gets out, i never
hear from him again.

284
00:17:29,854 --> 00:17:32,147
- Until he gets arrested.
- He called me,

285
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:34,822
he asked for my help,
and i hung up on him.

286
00:17:34,942 --> 00:17:37,078
What about redemption?

287
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,014
This play's not about john.

288
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:42,342
- Where were you last night?
- I was here.

289
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,444
At rehearsal.

290
00:17:44,512 --> 00:17:46,872
Which i need to get back to.

291
00:17:46,992 --> 00:17:49,665
I'll think about what you
said. About those jokes.

292
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:53,821
Three women. That's
the name of your play?

293
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:57,291
- Yes.
- I know this story, don't i?

294
00:17:57,358 --> 00:17:59,945
Well, it's a true story.

295
00:18:00,065 --> 00:18:04,188
Len lyle hix goes to prison for
20 years for killing three women.

296
00:18:04,308 --> 00:18:06,446
Beats them to death with a bat.

297
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:10,140
- Those are the facts, not the story.
- The story's about redemption?

298
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,521
Yeah, that's right. Redemption.

299
00:18:18,648 --> 00:18:21,348
Well, let's put john back in the box,

300
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:23,818
find out why he never mentioned nina.

301
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,983
- You get flowers back from county?
- Little hitch with that.

302
00:18:30,103 --> 00:18:33,475
When he got to county, our friend
flowers asked for another phone call.

303
00:18:33,595 --> 00:18:37,391
He called in his own transfer to
minimum security, hospital wing.

304
00:18:37,511 --> 00:18:39,777
And then he just walked away.

305
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:46,715
- Escaped?
- Nina, john's gonna need support.

306
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,190
He reached out for you before,
and he's gonna do it again.

307
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,979
When john calls you, that call's gotta

308
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,111
last more than six
seconds, you understand me?

309
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:56,465
Yeah, i understand, detective.

310
00:19:04,836 --> 00:19:07,523
- Flowers wrote all three women?
- Yup.

311
00:19:07,643 --> 00:19:09,708
- Promised them all the world?
- Yup.

312
00:19:09,828 --> 00:19:12,082
- Women write you?
- Yup.

313
00:19:12,202 --> 00:19:14,479
- You write 'em back?
- No.

314
00:19:14,968 --> 00:19:16,886
What's she doing?

315
00:19:17,006 --> 00:19:18,639
Speed-reading.

316
00:19:18,706 --> 00:19:21,344
12 pages a minute. I counted.

317
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:23,744
Maybe she's a robot.

318
00:19:23,812 --> 00:19:25,746
Have you seen her blink?

319
00:19:25,814 --> 00:19:27,782
Robots don't blink.

320
00:19:44,232 --> 00:19:46,601
- Blinked.
- Saw that.

321
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:50,204
Transcripts from flowers's trial.

322
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,520
I'll do a summary, but i
think you should see this.

323
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,440
Page 73, paragraph four.

324
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,479
Flowers's partner pulled the heist.

325
00:19:59,547 --> 00:20:02,664
They get caught ten hours later,
but the diamonds are never found.

326
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,787
And the dead girl's
apartment was torn up

327
00:20:04,907 --> 00:20:07,188
like someone was looking for something.

328
00:20:07,255 --> 00:20:09,914
Where's flowers's partner now?

329
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:21,508
- What's that smell?
- Disinfectant.

330
00:20:22,603 --> 00:20:25,328
- Underneath it.
- Need.

331
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:29,509
Never been in one of these before.

332
00:20:29,577 --> 00:20:31,559
Neither have i.

333
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,216
Need? I didn't think need had a smell.

334
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:38,782
Honey pot, you ready for papa bear?

335
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:43,290
Cops. I don't want cops.

336
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:45,488
Where's my honey pot?

337
00:20:45,793 --> 00:20:50,173
This is my court-ordered conjugal
rights hour. Where's my honey pot?

338
00:20:50,293 --> 00:20:52,432
Well, your hour's now 59 minutes long,

339
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,313
but the faster you talk,
the faster we leave.

340
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:57,449
Or we can take it outside where
everybody'd see you talking to cops.

341
00:20:57,705 --> 00:21:00,877
You know what, let's do that anyway.
I don't like the smell in here.

342
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:03,610
Look, i just want my honey pot.

343
00:21:03,678 --> 00:21:05,715
John flowers.

344
00:21:05,835 --> 00:21:08,582
You pulled that jewelry heist together.

345
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:11,031
He got out. You're still in here.

346
00:21:11,341 --> 00:21:13,060
I had a longer sentence.

347
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,621
Well, you shouldn't have
broken that cop's arm

348
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:16,590
- when they arrested you.
- Yeah, i know that now.

349
00:21:16,657 --> 00:21:18,425
You should have gone easy like john.

350
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:20,961
I hear john's not so
easy anymore, is he?

351
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,763
Heard he killed a woman.

352
00:21:22,883 --> 00:21:25,149
You hear where he might happen to be?

353
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:26,566
No.

354
00:21:27,517 --> 00:21:29,803
Those diamonds you stole,

355
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,772
any idea where they are?

356
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:33,774
You know, a funny thing
about those diamonds,

357
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:36,817
you see, i thought john had
'em, he thought i had 'em.

358
00:21:36,937 --> 00:21:38,773
That is funny.

359
00:21:38,893 --> 00:21:41,142
This, though, not so funny.

360
00:21:44,005 --> 00:21:46,043
Flowers whack her?

361
00:21:47,688 --> 00:21:49,990
Damn.

362
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,923
You know her.

363
00:21:53,217 --> 00:21:56,021
- How do you know her?
- She wrote to me.

364
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:57,864
Like a lot of them other girls do.

365
00:21:57,933 --> 00:22:00,281
- You write back?
- Just once and that was it.

366
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:01,860
- Not your type?
- For two reasons.

367
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,730
One, she asked me the wrong question.

368
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,955
- Really. And what would that be?
- What was i thinking?

369
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,143
And number two, she was too old.

370
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:13,287
Girl's gotta be half my
age, minus three years, tops.

371
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:17,488
Now i'm 40, and i want my honey pot.

372
00:22:20,226 --> 00:22:22,323
Honey pot! Honey pot!

373
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:26,760
- Papa bear.
- Oh, ooh. Ooh, pudding.

374
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,841
I don't think honey
pot has a 15-year plan.

375
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:38,253
- These girls just write anybody?
- No, they won't.

376
00:22:38,373 --> 00:22:41,875
But sally murdoch wrote to the two men

377
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,764
that were involved
in that jewelry heist,

378
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:46,036
and now sally murdoch is dead.

379
00:22:50,718 --> 00:22:53,597
- What's he doing?
- Reading.

380
00:22:54,655 --> 00:22:56,312
Slowly.

381
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:59,840
Very, very slowly.

382
00:23:05,733 --> 00:23:08,013
Just so you know...

383
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:11,800
i'm not a robot.

384
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,246
Anything interesting in there?

385
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,914
Our dead girl is in here.

386
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,883
Well, that's impossible.
I read that transcript.

387
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,668
There's no mention of
sally murdoch in there.

388
00:23:24,788 --> 00:23:26,501
Read the whole thing?

389
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:29,470
- Read the last page?
- Well, that's not part of the trial.

390
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,759
It's just the signature page.
It's the judge, bailiff...

391
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:33,460
court reporter.

392
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:37,197
Sally murdoch, court reporter.

393
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:39,523
She worked closed
captioning at that tv station

394
00:23:39,643 --> 00:23:42,951
- for three years, but before that...
- our victim was the court reporter.

395
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:45,373
Our victim was the court reporter.

396
00:23:48,514 --> 00:23:50,585
John flowers goes to trial

397
00:23:50,705 --> 00:23:53,735
for a jewelry store heist from
which the diamonds are never found.

398
00:23:53,855 --> 00:23:56,566
Sally murdoch, the court
reporter from that trial,

399
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:59,333
starts writing flowers, and
then he moves in with her

400
00:23:59,401 --> 00:24:01,383
- when he gets out of prison.
- And then she gets beaten to death.

401
00:24:01,503 --> 00:24:03,139
Flowers beat her to death.

402
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:06,194
His blood, his prints, his diamonds.

403
00:24:17,285 --> 00:24:20,488
Well, i'll be damned.
She brought him in.

404
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:39,019
Didn't mention who sally was last
time we were in this room, john.

405
00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:42,658
- No, i didn't. Can you guess why?
- It would look like she was working you

406
00:24:42,778 --> 00:24:45,617
for the diamonds, you found out
about it, and you killed her.

407
00:24:45,737 --> 00:24:46,881
But i didn't.

408
00:24:46,948 --> 00:24:49,964
When did you figure out sally was
the court reporter at your trial?

409
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,067
We swapped a few letters.

410
00:24:54,187 --> 00:24:56,355
She came to visit.

411
00:24:56,858 --> 00:25:00,499
- And i remembered her face.
- From the trial.

412
00:25:01,173 --> 00:25:04,164
Yeah, i looked at her. A lot.

413
00:25:04,232 --> 00:25:06,527
Didn't want to be there.

414
00:25:07,469 --> 00:25:10,868
Don't let this go to trial, john.
Don't fight us. Work with us.

415
00:25:10,988 --> 00:25:14,356
- Let's work together on this, okay?
- Work together?

416
00:25:14,476 --> 00:25:16,608
You mean you want me to
say that i killed her?

417
00:25:16,728 --> 00:25:18,546
Then we can help you.

418
00:25:18,613 --> 00:25:20,776
Look, you did the right thing
letting nina bring you in here.

419
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,650
Don't stop now.

420
00:25:22,717 --> 00:25:25,152
Look, i knew sally was working me, okay.

421
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:26,921
I didn't care.

422
00:25:26,988 --> 00:25:29,289
I don't know where those diamonds are.

423
00:25:29,357 --> 00:25:32,498
- You tell sally that?
- No, i didn't.

424
00:25:33,248 --> 00:25:35,696
You don't have the diamonds.

425
00:25:35,764 --> 00:25:38,955
You don't tell sally you
don't have the diamonds.

426
00:25:39,075 --> 00:25:42,589
- Why exactly is that?
- Because...

427
00:25:47,375 --> 00:25:49,276
i'm that guy.

428
00:25:50,366 --> 00:25:52,975
Which guy is that, john?

429
00:25:53,615 --> 00:25:56,522
The guy who does anything to get by.

430
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,731
Who promised everything to everybody.

431
00:26:03,124 --> 00:26:05,860
Promised three women the world.

432
00:26:07,428 --> 00:26:09,325
And what about sally?

433
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:11,744
I don't know where those diamonds are,

434
00:26:12,515 --> 00:26:16,732
- but i did know she'd keep looking.
- So you knew she'd never leave.

435
00:26:16,852 --> 00:26:18,808
I loved her.

436
00:26:20,008 --> 00:26:23,642
She was the face i looked
at when i was on trial.

437
00:26:27,015 --> 00:26:29,617
So what's gonna happen now?

438
00:26:29,684 --> 00:26:33,606
They're gonna charge you with
murder, and they will find you guilty.

439
00:26:33,726 --> 00:26:37,672
Evidence, motive, your record.
You will be found guilty, john,

440
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:40,255
and you will spend the
rest of your life in prison.

441
00:26:42,531 --> 00:26:44,432
That true?

442
00:26:49,928 --> 00:26:52,195
So she's working out?

443
00:26:52,315 --> 00:26:54,589
Yeah, she's doing okay.

444
00:26:54,709 --> 00:26:58,092
- Well, don't forget about me.
- I won't.

445
00:26:58,212 --> 00:27:01,550
So he killed her because she
was working him for the diamonds?

446
00:27:02,283 --> 00:27:04,297
Yeah, looks like it.

447
00:27:04,417 --> 00:27:06,702
You don't think so?

448
00:27:09,654 --> 00:27:10,975
Crews?

449
00:27:11,545 --> 00:27:14,895
Sometimes things are
just what they look like.

450
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,370
Right?

451
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:21,045
Yeah, reese, sometimes things
are just what they look like.

452
00:27:21,665 --> 00:27:23,750
I should get back to work.

453
00:27:24,011 --> 00:27:25,873
See ya, reese.

454
00:27:25,941 --> 00:27:28,280
Yeah. See ya, crews.

455
00:27:29,678 --> 00:27:33,143
What was reese doing on that
boat with rayborn, charlie?

456
00:27:33,714 --> 00:27:36,249
That's not the question.

457
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:38,397
What is the question then?

458
00:27:38,804 --> 00:27:41,388
What's she doing at the fbi?

459
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,826
We're just asking you to be a cop.

460
00:28:06,748 --> 00:28:09,249
Amy from the church
wants to save his soul.

461
00:28:09,317 --> 00:28:11,585
Sally, the court reporter,
wants his diamonds.

462
00:28:11,653 --> 00:28:14,057
What does nina want from john flowers?

463
00:28:14,177 --> 00:28:17,405
You know, i don't think
i really understand this.

464
00:28:17,525 --> 00:28:20,815
The three women that len lyle
hix killed are all one woman.

465
00:28:20,935 --> 00:28:23,804
Sometimes they're the guard,
sometimes they're his cellmate,

466
00:28:23,924 --> 00:28:26,702
and sometimes... sometimes
i think they're even len lyle.

467
00:28:26,822 --> 00:28:30,371
But i'm not so sure about
that last part. It's confusing.

468
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:33,703
Take a look at this. Come here.

469
00:28:36,978 --> 00:28:39,964
So in the play your character's
in the electric chair.

470
00:28:40,084 --> 00:28:43,160
That's right. Old sparky.

471
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,234
But of course, you yourself
were never in the electric chair.

472
00:28:46,354 --> 00:28:48,022
Not my body.

473
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:50,057
My soul, man.

474
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:52,826
In that chair. Every day.

475
00:28:52,894 --> 00:28:55,822
- Ready to die.
- Now watch this.

476
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:59,455
- Here's my favorite part.
- How did you two meet?

477
00:28:59,575 --> 00:29:03,350
- I wrote to len lyle.
- And i wrote back.

478
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,889
- And she wrote to the parole board.
- Yes, i did.

479
00:29:07,009 --> 00:29:09,424
It had become clear that
len lyle was not the man

480
00:29:09,544 --> 00:29:12,087
that went to prison 20 years ago.

481
00:29:12,814 --> 00:29:15,181
She's a...

482
00:29:16,084 --> 00:29:18,438
real good writer, man.

483
00:29:57,258 --> 00:30:00,066
How come he's not saying anything?

484
00:30:02,063 --> 00:30:03,864
He's communing.

485
00:30:03,932 --> 00:30:05,866
Commuting?

486
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:09,002
Communing. With death.

487
00:30:10,496 --> 00:30:12,583
Okay. Thanks.

488
00:30:23,752 --> 00:30:25,599
Who is he now?

489
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:28,278
The three dead girls or the killer?

490
00:30:30,091 --> 00:30:32,191
He's all four of them.

491
00:30:34,729 --> 00:30:36,964
And the guard too?

492
00:30:37,031 --> 00:30:40,604
Yes. And the guard too.

493
00:30:41,836 --> 00:30:44,528
So hard to understand.

494
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,992
You gotta watch it more than once.

495
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:04,658
What kind of bat did you use
when you did those three girls?

496
00:31:04,725 --> 00:31:07,050
It doesn't say in the program.

497
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:15,487
- You're that cop.
- I have a question.

498
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:18,900
Now if you don't have a
bat, can you use a 3-iron?

499
00:31:22,242 --> 00:31:24,329
Let's take it outside.

500
00:31:25,373 --> 00:31:27,914
What would be the fun in that?

501
00:31:29,317 --> 00:31:31,332
Excuse me.

502
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:34,454
Excuse me. I'm sorry to
interrupt the program,

503
00:31:34,574 --> 00:31:37,502
everyone, although, i
think we know how it ends.

504
00:31:37,622 --> 00:31:40,932
But we have a very special
guest with us tonight.

505
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:45,856
Another sweet product of a sour system.

506
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,283
Ladies and gentlemen, charlie crews.

507
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:14,461
Looks like your work, len lyle.

508
00:32:16,331 --> 00:32:19,932
Imitation. Flattery. You know.

509
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:22,466
Poor girl.

510
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:26,509
- You say a 3-iron did that?
- Where were you last night?

511
00:32:27,308 --> 00:32:30,584
Publicity tour. Oakland.

512
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:33,144
You having a good time?

513
00:32:35,383 --> 00:32:37,915
I'm having a great time.

514
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:40,246
How about you?

515
00:32:47,282 --> 00:32:50,411
- So what do you think?
- I think len lyle hix does not

516
00:32:50,531 --> 00:32:53,096
have a healthy respect for his tools.

517
00:32:58,614 --> 00:33:01,223
You think len lyle
was after the diamonds?

518
00:33:02,365 --> 00:33:05,788
You think he finds
out about it from nina

519
00:33:05,857 --> 00:33:08,064
and then goes after sally?

520
00:33:08,184 --> 00:33:12,343
'cause those three girls that
len lyle killed with that bat,

521
00:33:12,463 --> 00:33:15,498
he stole a total of like $43 off 'em.

522
00:33:15,566 --> 00:33:18,068
Those diamonds were
probably really tempting.

523
00:33:18,135 --> 00:33:19,736
What do you think?

524
00:33:19,803 --> 00:33:24,301
I think we should think about
what len lyle was thinking about.

525
00:33:24,914 --> 00:33:28,292
He's thinking, "did sally work alone?

526
00:33:28,412 --> 00:33:31,199
Or did she have a partner?"
Now if she had a partner,

527
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:33,316
maybe i want to talk to that person too.

528
00:33:33,384 --> 00:33:35,185
A partner.

529
00:33:35,253 --> 00:33:37,553
Okay. Okay.

530
00:33:38,068 --> 00:33:42,006
Sally was writing john flowers
letters for just about three years.

531
00:33:42,823 --> 00:33:47,118
Sally also worked at that news
station for just about three years.

532
00:33:49,633 --> 00:33:52,316
- I can drive if you want.
- No, it's okay.

533
00:33:52,436 --> 00:33:55,037
- I'm a good driver.
- I'm sure you are.

534
00:33:57,674 --> 00:34:00,536
Okay. How good are you?

535
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,080
Stock car open wheel.

536
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,786
A guy i used to date
kinda won the indy 500.

537
00:34:06,906 --> 00:34:08,751
- Taught me a few things.
- Yeah.

538
00:34:08,819 --> 00:34:11,789
- 15-year plan to be
mayor? - I have your vote?

539
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:13,811
I'll think about it.

540
00:34:13,931 --> 00:34:15,876
You drive.

541
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:21,031
Now we can talk here or back
down at the police station.

542
00:34:21,098 --> 00:34:23,199
I told you everything i know.

543
00:34:23,267 --> 00:34:24,901
If it's the station, just so you know,

544
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:26,602
we put you in the car,
we turn the light on,

545
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,187
people see, your boss finds
out, it goes in your file.

546
00:34:29,307 --> 00:34:31,107
Maybe i should talk to a lawyer.

547
00:34:31,175 --> 00:34:33,443
I'm a lawyer. So you're
talking to one right now.

548
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,584
- Let's get in the car.
- Okay,

549
00:34:35,704 --> 00:34:36,943
okay.

550
00:34:37,063 --> 00:34:39,797
Sally told me about the
trial and about the diamonds.

551
00:34:39,917 --> 00:34:43,736
We had done a story about
women who write men in prison.

552
00:34:43,856 --> 00:34:46,323
I told her to write the guy

553
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:48,599
and see if she could find
out where the diamonds are.

554
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,176
I told her that she should turn them
in, if she found them, for the reward.

555
00:34:52,296 --> 00:34:55,136
The reward. Well, good for you, sam.

556
00:34:55,256 --> 00:34:57,200
You know what's a
better reward than money?

557
00:34:57,268 --> 00:35:00,045
Doing good. You know why?

558
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:02,439
Because when you do good, you feel good.

559
00:35:02,506 --> 00:35:05,323
- When you do bad, you feel bad.
- This guy right here,

560
00:35:05,443 --> 00:35:08,210
- he feels bad a lot.
- I don't know him.

561
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,770
He didn't come round
asking about the diamonds?

562
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,049
He's a pretty scary-looking guy.

563
00:35:13,117 --> 00:35:14,985
Maybe he sent someone
else to ask his questions.

564
00:35:15,052 --> 00:35:17,902
- You ever see her?
- Her i know. She's that writer.

565
00:35:18,022 --> 00:35:21,648
- Which writer is that?
- She was writing a play about the news.

566
00:35:21,768 --> 00:35:24,011
- She wanted to do some research.
- She talk to you?

567
00:35:24,131 --> 00:35:26,317
- A little bit.
- She talk to sally?

568
00:35:26,437 --> 00:35:28,339
Sally tell you what they talk about?

569
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,094
No, she didn't. Can i go?

570
00:35:32,717 --> 00:35:34,550
They did it together.

571
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,620
Len lyle kills sally...

572
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,670
and nina gets john
flowers to turn himself in.

573
00:35:42,717 --> 00:35:45,062
Why'd she turn him in?

574
00:35:45,182 --> 00:35:47,106
John flowers.

575
00:35:47,226 --> 00:35:49,911
- Why did nina turn him in?
- Because you asked her to.

576
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:52,489
Come on, len. Why'd she turn him in?

577
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:54,867
It was the right thing to do.

578
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:58,943
You want me to sign one of these
plays for you? Some girls love it.

579
00:35:59,063 --> 00:36:03,314
We got surveillance cameras by
the elevators back at the station.

580
00:36:03,434 --> 00:36:05,968
We got tape of nina in the lobby

581
00:36:06,037 --> 00:36:08,271
leaving after she turned him in.

582
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:11,494
She looked happy. Big smile.

583
00:36:12,644 --> 00:36:16,101
- Like i said, she did the right thing.
- Send him back where he belongs.

584
00:36:16,221 --> 00:36:19,737
Well, you can't have killers roaming the
streets all willy-nilly-like, now can you?

585
00:36:19,857 --> 00:36:23,778
Or nina turned him in, and he
goes down for a killing you did.

586
00:36:26,432 --> 00:36:28,193
Anywho.

587
00:36:29,173 --> 00:36:31,461
That picture you showed me...

588
00:36:31,529 --> 00:36:33,363
the dead girl.

589
00:36:33,431 --> 00:36:36,032
If i do it again,

590
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,448
there won't be enough
left for a photo like that.

591
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:42,250
You having a good time?

592
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:44,799
Sure am. Aren't you?

593
00:36:50,535 --> 00:36:52,848
Well, len lyle's alibi checks out.

594
00:36:52,916 --> 00:36:55,592
He was in oakland during
the time of the killing.

595
00:36:55,712 --> 00:36:58,412
You think nina could
have done that killing?

596
00:36:59,115 --> 00:37:01,757
Nina seem like the kind of woman
who'd kill to get those diamonds?

597
00:37:01,877 --> 00:37:04,997
No, not the diamonds.

598
00:37:07,449 --> 00:37:10,366
These surveillance photos we
have of her leaving the station.

599
00:37:10,434 --> 00:37:13,484
- Why was she smiling?
- 'Cause she got what she wanted.

600
00:37:13,604 --> 00:37:16,410
- Except for the diamonds.
- Nina wasn't looking for diamonds.

601
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,941
She was looking for sally.

602
00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:22,912
Looking for the letters
that flowers sent sally.

603
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,285
- See what he promised her.
- So nina comes in here,

604
00:37:26,405 --> 00:37:30,382
she's looking for the letters. Sally
catches her, it gets out of hand.

605
00:37:30,502 --> 00:37:32,655
Nina wants john flowers back.

606
00:37:32,723 --> 00:37:34,624
Only one way to make that happen.

607
00:37:34,691 --> 00:37:36,626
She kills sally.

608
00:37:36,693 --> 00:37:39,192
And flowers calls her for help.

609
00:37:40,131 --> 00:37:42,625
He calls her again when he escapes.

610
00:37:43,798 --> 00:37:46,114
And she brings him right to us.

611
00:37:46,489 --> 00:37:50,821
Her rehearsal alibi's soft.
Theater's dark. She could come and go,

612
00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:52,917
and no one would ever see her.

613
00:38:00,951 --> 00:38:02,985
What did she do after that?

614
00:38:03,105 --> 00:38:05,671
After nina kills sally?

615
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:09,086
- She sneaks back to rehearsal.
- No,

616
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:11,327
what does she do after that?

617
00:38:23,596 --> 00:38:26,058
Why'd you turn john in?

618
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:34,177
'cause it was the right thing to do?

619
00:38:34,643 --> 00:38:36,974
Put him back where he belongs?

620
00:38:37,094 --> 00:38:38,230
Yes.

621
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,120
On the other end of those letters?

622
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,696
Where he needs you?

623
00:38:43,816 --> 00:38:46,594
Len lyle hix doesn't need you, does he?

624
00:38:46,661 --> 00:38:49,325
'cause len lyle hix is a star.

625
00:38:49,445 --> 00:38:51,445
And, flowers,

626
00:38:51,565 --> 00:38:53,668
he was with another woman.

627
00:38:54,225 --> 00:38:57,633
The woman dies, and
john goes back to prison.

628
00:38:58,507 --> 00:39:00,930
- Then he needs you.
- John killed that woman.

629
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,440
No, you did.

630
00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:06,676
What did you do after?

631
00:39:10,318 --> 00:39:14,288
How'd you deal with it? Taking a life?

632
00:39:15,194 --> 00:39:17,892
All your life, writing to criminals,

633
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:20,519
writing about criminals,

634
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:22,306
just writing.

635
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,458
- You killed that woman...
- I did not.

636
00:39:24,578 --> 00:39:27,034
She's there, and then she's not there.

637
00:39:27,474 --> 00:39:31,000
Her blood, it should be
in her body, but it's not.

638
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,199
- It's on you.
- Was not.

639
00:39:36,578 --> 00:39:39,480
It's still on you, what happened.

640
00:39:39,548 --> 00:39:41,470
What you did.

641
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,562
Always on you.

642
00:39:43,682 --> 00:39:45,986
You can feel it.

643
00:39:47,145 --> 00:39:49,754
But how do you deal with it?

644
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,574
You write it down, don't you?

645
00:39:56,197 --> 00:39:58,699
You have to write it down.

646
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,011
Best thing you ever wrote?

647
00:40:19,145 --> 00:40:21,722
Let me read it now, nina.

648
00:40:49,348 --> 00:40:51,924
So where are the diamonds?

649
00:40:52,044 --> 00:40:54,013
Honey pot?

650
00:40:54,133 --> 00:40:55,589
Yeah.

651
00:41:10,172 --> 00:41:12,813
Nice belly ring.

652
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:15,242
Can i ask where you got that?

653
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:18,182
Didn't i tell you never
to wear them out in public?

654
00:41:18,302 --> 00:41:21,262
- Didn't i?
- Well, what's the point of having them

655
00:41:21,382 --> 00:41:24,198
if i can't wear them? Right?

656
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:27,072
- Right.
- Right.

657
00:41:30,436 --> 00:41:33,093
Our recent guest, len lyle hix,

658
00:41:33,213 --> 00:41:34,895
finds himself back in prison

659
00:41:34,963 --> 00:41:37,565
for an apparently unprovoked attack

660
00:41:37,632 --> 00:41:39,633
on a los angeles police detective.

661
00:41:39,701 --> 00:41:41,635
Los angeles police detective?

662
00:41:41,703 --> 00:41:44,438
The altercation occurred at
a performance of the play,

663
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:47,263
three women, which is
based on len lyle's crimes,

664
00:41:47,383 --> 00:41:51,376
time in prison, and until
now, apparent rehabilitation.

665
00:41:51,496 --> 00:41:53,981
Here to talk about repeat offenders

666
00:41:54,049 --> 00:41:57,912

prison is noted psychiatrist...

667

668
00:42:00,341 --> 00:42:02,478
This is charlie crews.

669
00:42:03,685 --> 00:42:06,511
