00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,090
uniforms recognize him as felix bana.

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,990
Dealt drugs off this corner.

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,210
one gunshot wound to the chest.

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,410
Burn marks on his shirt.

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,430
Whoever shot felix pushed the gun right
up against him and pulled the trigger.

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,940
Pockets have been turned inside-out.

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,840
Someone took whatever felix was holding.

9
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:31,140
Got one gunshot but four casings.

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,460
The other three shots went that way.

11
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,160
The killer shoots felix at close range.

12
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,060
She runs.

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,380
Killer stays down there with felix
and puts three bullets into her back.

14
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,200
That's when she stops running.

15
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,390
She got tequila coming
off of her. Lots of it.

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,740
White powder up the nose.
This girl was rolling.

17
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,590
potter elementary.

18
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,200
That's way out in the valley.
She's a long way from home.

19
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,630
People go a lot further than
this to get what she needed.

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,130
I know she's a cat, but
fluffy is dear to my heart.

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,580
If she needs an operation,
get her an operation.

24
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,390
Got a sick cat?

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,350
Bad liver.

26
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,830
Maybe she should lay off the booze.

27
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,110
That's what I tell her. But you
know cats, they can be so willful.

28
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,590
Felix bana.

29
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,640
- He sold for you.
- He sold for me?

30
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,660
Don't repeat what I say.
I know felix sold for you.

31
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,960
Now felix is dead.

32
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,140
Maybe you can tell me
who might want felix dead.

33
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,600
Okay.

34
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,500
You know what I do.

35
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:09,110
Then you also know that how felix
died is an occupational hazard.

36
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,900
Just surprised law enforcement cares.

37
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,510
About a dead drug dealer? We don'T.

38
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,360
About a dead school teacher...

39
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,780
found shot with felix?

40
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,190
We care about her.

41
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,190
Kendall and I started
teaching here the same year.

42
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,260
Kids love her.

43
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,600
Heidi, do you know why kendall
was in that part of town?

44
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,050
No, I don'T. We never go there.

45
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,350
Well, she'd been doing drugs.

46
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,750
The place she was found, it's
where you go to score drugs.

47
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,410
Kendall didn't score drugs.

48
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,710
A few beers after work or
when we played pictionary.

49
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,720
Did kendall ever mention a drug
dealer named felix bana to you?

50
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,300
Okay, look. I understand that you
want to protect your reputation,

51
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,560
but you need to tell us the truth if
you want to help us find who killed her.

52
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,120
Kendall didn't know any drug dealers.

53
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,530
She didn't do drugs.

54
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,540
Maybe not with you. Maybe...

55
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,970
maybe she had a boyfriend
that she did 'em with?

56
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,300
She didn't date much.

57
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,890
These kids take up all our time.

58
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,580
I wish I could help
you, detective. I do.

59
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,430
I want you to find who killed my felix.

60
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,800
But I don't know anything about it.

61
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,990
Think another minute.

62
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,810
This is a nice house.

63
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,180
These are nice chairs. I'm
sure fluffy is a nice cat.

64
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,770
Which means you must
have a nice businesS.

65
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,150
A dead school teacher.

66
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,500
That's the kind of thing that
really hurts a nice business.

67
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,990
Okay.

68
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,730
I'm thinking.

69
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,690
I'm thinking if teachers looked
like that when I was a kid,

70
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,310
maybe I'd have stayed at school
and made something of myself.

71
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,740
Kendall'S.

72
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,850
She left it in her desk.

73
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,020
Felix bana sold for justin tapp.

74
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,460
Narcotics says the dealing in
that area had been pretty stable.

75
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,770
No turf wars.

76
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,080
Uniforms canvassing the
area turned up nothing.

77
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,890
No murder weapons. No witnesses.

78
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,910
And ballistics didn't match the
bullet to any previous crime.

79
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,040
Bana was a drug dealer.

80
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,550
Odds are his untimely death was caused by
an unhappy customer with an unregistered gun.

81
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,340
That still leaves the question of
our school teacher, kendall shay.

82
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,880
Nothing connects her to felix bana.

83
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:18,320
Except all the devil's dandruff
up our school teacher's beak.

84
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,880
She's a coke head. He's a coke dealer.

85
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,770
Her school did a random drug test
on her last month, she came up clean.

86
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,740
Well, maybe something happened since then
that caused her to get all gacked out.

87
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,260
Hey, I got a list of five-digit
numbers in the back of her address book.

88
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,810
I spoke to her parents in ohio.

89
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,950
They said that kendall could
not have been in a better place.

90
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,880
She loved her job.
She loved her students.

91
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,290
Oh, okay. You tell
your parents everything?

92
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,290
Those were in her address book?

93
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,530
I know what those numbers are.

94
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,320
Those are badge numbers.

95
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,580
They're lapd badge numbers.

96
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,570
And these grades. B
plus, b, b minus, a minus.

97
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,230
Kendall shay dated and rated L.A.Cops.

98
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,370
She's a cop groupie.

99
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,080
Badge bunny.

100
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,860
What? You don't use that term out here?

101
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,910
We use it.

102
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,430
Let's look up the names
attached to the badges.

103
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,850
Or maybe we shouldn'T.

104
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,590
This doesn't change anything.

105
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,620
Kendall shay was found shot
dead next to a drug dealer.

106
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,100
It was a drug killing.

107
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,420
Follow the drugs.

108
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,470
how does she follow the drugs?

109
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,760
How did kendall get down there?

110
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,130
Her car was in her house.

111
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,630
How did she get down to that place?

112
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,710
Someone must've driven her.

113
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,770
Maybe someone she was dating?

114
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,740
Okay, you two have to
talk to the men she dated.

115
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,300
But you do that very carefully.

116
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,120
Understood.

117
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,910
Aw, jeez, we gotta bring cops down herE.

118
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,960
No, we don't have to
bring 'em down here.

119
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,010
We can go see 'em.

120
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,760
There's a death in the cop family.

121
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,560
It's gonna be a cop family wakE.

122
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,380
Called around the cop bars.

123
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,990
Lucky seven is having a
thing for kendall shay.

124
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,340
These are six lapd cops that
match those badge numbers.

125
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,370
Graham there got the a minus.

126
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,830
- Hey, charlie, you got a minute?
- Yeah.

127
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,010
Heard you and reese caught
the kendall shay shooting.

128
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,530
Yeah, bobby. Do you know kendall shay?

129
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,790
No, charlie, never met her.

130
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,120
But you question her friends,
my name just might come up.

131
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,390
So if it does, just let me know, okay?

132
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,820
- Yeah, okay, bobby.
- Thanks, charlie.

133
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,360
Stark, huh?

134
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,730
It was wtten all over his face.

135
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,970
Let me guess.

136
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,800
He got liquored up, he
strayed, he felt bad.

137
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,800
She took him back and it's all good now.

138
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,070
Close?

139
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,070
I really can't say.

140
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,770
Okay.

141
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,780
We'll go to the lucky seven.

142
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,860
We'll see if we can find
the six cops on this list.

143
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,230
We'll ask 'em a few questions.

144
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,150
And then we'll leave.

145
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,700
- Sounds like a plan.
- Okay.

146
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,020
There a bird that mates for life?

147
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,870
Parrot, I think. Or the goose.

148
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,360
I hate birds.

149
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,810
you knew kendall?

150
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,300
No, not really.

151
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,180
- You're just paying your respects?
- Yeah.

152
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,990
That's sweet.

153
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,950
After all, she was one of us.

154
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,730
You're a detective, right?

155
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,470
I can tell.

156
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,890
Do I know you?

157
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,220
No, but I know you.

158
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,040
You're charlie crews, right?

159
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,950
- You a friend of kendall's?
- No, you?

160
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,730
No, I just came to pay my respects.

161
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,490
I haven't seen you around the softball
games or the car washes, have I?

162
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,650
Why would you see me at a car wash?

163
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,480
Because you're A...

164
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,070
a what?

165
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,750
Aren't you A... a cop.

166
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,540
Oh, I haven't seen a girl cop
here when the bunnies are around.

167
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,790
Did you just say girl cop?

168
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,880
Hey, if you're a girl cop, does that
mean there are lesbo badge bunnies?

169
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,520
Did you just say lesbo?

170
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,850
Isn't that the word, "lesbo"?

171
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,880
They're a support group.
Charity events, fundraisers.

172
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,380
Car washes. I heard.

173
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,430
Any luck?

174
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,450
No. It's more crowded than I
thought. She must've been liked.

175
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,350
I'd like to come to my own wake.

176
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,400
Then you'd be dead.

177
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,150
Except for that part.

178
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,320
Just to see who'd show
up. See what they'd say.

179
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,840
Pretty girls in black dresses,
weeping quietly in small groups.

180
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,940
Or all by themselves.

181
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,490
Let me know when you touch down.

182
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,850
Hey, we need to talk to
the six men on this list.

183
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,860
We don't want to embarrass anyone.

184
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,760
So if you know where they
are, just point them out.

185
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,130
We'll get this over
nice and quietly--

186
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,780
you guys investigating kendall's death?

187
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,570
That's right? And you are?

188
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,750
Alex lauer. Officer alex lauer.

189
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,240
Your name isn't on that list, alex.

190
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,650
So maybe you want to hand it on back.

191
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,980
You need to talk to these guys,
I think I can help you with that.

192
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,470
Cody, kill that music, will you?

193
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,580
Okay, listen up!

194
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,940
We got two detectives here
investigating kendall's death.

195
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,190
Now I got a list in my hand with the
names of kendall's friends written on it.

196
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,840
Now, you all know who you are.

197
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,940
You all knew this was coming.

198
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,930
And you all know what you need to do.

199
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,990
So in the back room,
right now. Let's go.

200
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,000
So you all knew kendall shay.

201
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,230
She was one of ours.

202
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,120
Anything you need from us to find out who
did this to her, go right ahead and ask.

203
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,860
And you got a room full of guys out
there who feel the exact same way.

204
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,100
We just need to ask you a few questions.

205
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,470
First, any of you ever
see kendadall do drugs?

206
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,310
We heard she was found
all coked up, but...

207
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,730
that wasn't kendall.

208
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,090
She was wine and beer, that's it.

209
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,360
There are six men on this list,
but only five of you are here.

210
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,080
We've id'd you all.

211
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,140
Any of you know where
we can find sean graham?

212
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,410
I'm guessing sean's your partner?

213
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,950
Yeah.

214
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,900
Look, I understand you wanting
to protect your partner.

215
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:36,170
But now we have to ask
if you know where he is.

216
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,300
Yeah, he's, uh, upstairs.

217
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,980
Sean, some detectives
here need to talk with you.

218
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,820
You here about kendall?

219
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,080
We are.

220
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,390
She's dead.

221
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,180
Someone shot her.

222
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,640
We'd like to ask you
some questions about her.

223
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,220
Maybe we should be alone.

224
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,060
No, it's okay.

225
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,720
She was kendall's friend too.

226
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,010
Hello, heidi.

227
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,940
Didn't recognize you out of school.

228
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,900
You were seeing kendall shaw?

229
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,990
Yeah, for about four months.

230
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,560
How come you weren't
downstairs at the wake?

231
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,640
I got a small case of the whirlies.

232
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,320
Too much to drink because...

233
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:51,760
yesterday, before she died,
kendall and I had a fight.

234
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,950
About that ring on your finger?

235
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:58,280
Yeah, left my wife six months ago.

236
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,920
Can't seem to take this off though.

237
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,350
The fight, sean. You hit kendall.

238
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,930
No. She scratched me.

239
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,290
You do your forensic work, you'll
find my skin all up under her nails.

240
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,520
- What else will we find?
- Me.

241
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,070
All over her.

242
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,550
You had sex?

243
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,970
Where were you after the fight?

244
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,670
I slept it off up here.

245
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,670
heidi, you didn't tell me you knew sean.

246
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,960
I knew sean and kendall had a bad fight.

247
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,230
And I didn't want you thinking that he
killed her, so I didn't say anything.

248
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,780
It was wrong. I'm sorry.

249
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,760
Heidi, are you seeing sean too?

250
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,390
Just a little bit.

251
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,030
Not like kendall.

252
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,460
She wanted the whole
thing. The ring, you know?

253
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,540
And did it bother kendall that you
were seeing sean just a little bit?

254
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,250
Why would it?

255
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,260
Where were you last night, heidi?

256
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,740
Home. Alone.

257
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,280
Are you, uh, you gonna book me?

258
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,770
No, not just yet.

259
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,750
You make yourself available
to us though, okay?

260
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:14,310
And, uh, we'll have
to talk to your wife.

261
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,840
Then protect yourself at all times.

262
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,410
Vairam went back to india.

263
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,240
And ed's in the hospital.

264
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,500
He got beat up during the earthquake.

265
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,920
Oh, that's terrible.

266
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,100
He was selling water for $50 a bottle.

267
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,170
Why...

268
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,830
is it wrong...

269
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:50,330
to charge $50 for a bottle of water?

270
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:56,150
Because business isn't just about
money. It's also about people.

271
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,910
How we treat each other as people.

272
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,670
I called you.

273
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,520
Nine times.

274
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,740
I know.

275
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,300
You didn't call me back.

276
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,970
I know. I'm sorry.

277
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,030
Ted, why is there only
one person in your class?

278
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,550
One person who's enrolled.

279
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,890
If you're not enrolled,
you're gonna have to leave.

280
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,200
You know, sean has girlfriends.

281
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,480
That wasn't a question, was it?

282
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,680
No, ma'am.

283
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,500
No, ma'am.

284
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,720
'Cause I'm his wife and
of course I would know.

285
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:59,120
It was my experience my wife knew things about
me even if she didn't know that she knew it.

286
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,430
Sean didn't have girlfriends
when we were still together.

287
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,250
Like you say, I would know.

288
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,200
We had our problems, but
that wasn't one of them.

289
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,370
What kind of problems?

290
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,450
You're a cop. You should know.

291
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,290
How'd your marriage work out?

292
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,350
Oh, there were, uh,
there were complications.

293
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,450
Was sean ever violent?

294
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,100
He hit you?

295
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,550
Once.

296
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,740
He'd been through some
stuff on the job that day.

297
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,000
Once. Never again.

298
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,730
I'm a suspect, aren't I?

299
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,110
You know the answer to that.

300
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,110
Heidi and kendall play for
this team, the badge bunnies?

301
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,250
You're asking that 'cause you
want to see if heidi had motive.

302
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,040
Maybe she killed kendall.

303
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,560
Honey, we only date cops.

304
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,430
We eat, sleep, and
breathe law enforcement.

305
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,830
If you're looking at heidi, you're gonna want
to establish means, motive, and opportunity.

306
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,610
You want a beer?

307
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,480
No.

308
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,280
I'm working right now.

309
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,890
I was at a dinner party at my sister'S.

310
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,410
She's trying to set me up with a friend.

311
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,750
Nice guy. Not a cop.

312
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,050
You know how to use a gun, diane?

313
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,280
I surely do.

314
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,090
Sean took me to the gun range
when we were first dating.

315
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,380
Did you like that?

316
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,920
I liked a lot of things
about him back then.

317
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,340
He wasn't the first cop you dated.

318
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,590
That wasn't a question either.

319
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,180
No, it wasn'T.

320
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,530
You were one of 'em.

321
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,530
Cop groupie. Badge bunny.

322
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:56,160
Yes, I was. Till I married sean.

323
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,160
And then I wasn't one of them anymore.

324
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:06,940
Detective, if I had met you back then, I
would've wanted you to take me to the gun range.

325
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:11,490
It would've been my pleasure.

326
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,100
You only date cops?

327
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,130
That's right.

328
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:19,340
Because cops risk their lives and
what's wrong with a little extra love?

329
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,430
That's pretty close. You date cops?

330
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,650
No, I am a cop.

331
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,020
I need to ask you
about kendall and heidi.

332
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,240
- They ever fight over sean?
- Fight? No.

333
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,490
Kendall loved sean. So does heidi.

334
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,540
We all love sean.

335
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,000
Heidi know how to use a gun?

336
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,550
Sure. Most of us can shoot.

337
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,260
If you're done, we have practice.

338
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,610
Yeah, sure.

339
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,390
.........

340
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,500
Only one occupant per stall.

341
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,730
I'm a close friend of the range
master. He wrote me a note.

342
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,980
So you found a dead girl
in an alley full of drugs?

343
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,180
Yeah. That's part of the job, right?

344
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,400
And all that time at the bar?

345
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,700
Who are you, my sponsor?

346
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,650
No, I'm your friend.

347
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,890
Mind if I try your shooter?

348
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,020
How come you don't have
anything on your walls?

349
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,490
- Like what?
- Like art or something.

350
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,660
Hey, there's a pool.

351
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,390
We should go swimming.

352
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,920
You want to go swimming, detective?

353
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,350
I want to ask you a question.

354
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,570
Your partner already questioned us.

355
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,040
I thought this was a social visit.

356
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,990
One question.

357
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,580
What?

358
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,990
Now I want to try yours.

359
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,880
Oh, I think this might be too
much gun for a little gal like you.

360
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,610
Did you just call me gal?

361
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,890
Gal? No, no.

362
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,320
I said "cal... ifornia woman."

363
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,430
Be
careful--

364
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,760
it has a kick.

365
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,090
how do you tell a good
cop from a bad cop?

366
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,950
Isn't that kind of your job to
tell good people from bad people?

367
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,180
You see cops differently than I do.

368
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,620
You mean naked?

369
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,160
You live your lives observing cops.

370
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,910
Can you tell the good from the bad?

371
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,560
- Yeah, we can.
- How?

372
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,500
Okay.

373
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,460
It's all about taste.

374
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,380
You're a good cop.

375
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,120
Mm,good cop.

376
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,860
Definitely good cop.

377
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,870
Now we're going swimming.

378
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,160
Luckily I have a
swimsuit under my clothes.

379
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,990
Oh,you don't have your swimsuit on.

380
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,200
Oh,yeah.

381
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,270
I forgot.

382
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,920
I don'T.

383
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,740
There are naked women in the pool.

384
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,630
- Ted.
- Yeah?

385
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,000
I've made a decision.

386
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,940
What's that,charlie?

387
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,900
I'm going swimming.

388
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,010
No man would hold that against you.

389
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,740
BobbY.

390
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,330
Is cathy here?

391
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,850
Hey,this is a nice pad.

392
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,520
You should have a party here sometime.

393
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,800
Cathy!

394
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,700
You out there?

395
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,120
bobby,is that you?

396
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,470
You get outta there right now!

397
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,750
Bobby,I didn't
know you were--

398
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,840
brother and sister.

399
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,460
Get dressed.

400
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,710
What did I tell you about
playing around at my station?

401
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,890
I'll take her home.

402
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,030
And you get back to what you were doing.

403
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,210
You didn't think to mention
you were bobby's sister?

404
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,160
Would you have let me kiss you if I did?

405
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,900
They look nothing alike.

406
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,740
I--I never
would've guessed.

407
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,820
Cathy,get dressed.

408
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,330
outside!

409
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,110
Crews.

410
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,170
Thanks. I'm on my way.

411
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,930
You wanna get kendall's killer?

412
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,310
Maybe I'll,uh...

413
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,420
I'll hold onto this.

414
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,420
I'm not used to doing this sober.

415
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,010
It's kind of the same thing.

416
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,400
Except no one gets sick.

417
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,730
I'll be the judge of that.

418
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,140
Call came in over the tip line.

419
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,100
The gun that shot kendall and that drug
dealer is in that house right there.

420
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,670
Let's serve a warrant,shall we?

421
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,720
You two drive here together?

422
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,110
No.

423
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,900
We just happened to get
here at the same time.

424
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,810
Is that glitter on your face?

425
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,690
I told cathy over and over. No
man likes that glitter stuff.

426
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,770
Who's cathy?

427
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,800
His sister.

428
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,670
Call,tip line,gun that shot kendall.

429
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,460
House,warrant.

430
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,810
That's not your gun.

431
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,170
You must be fluffy.

432
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,780
Fluffy?

433
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,740
What should I name him,kimba?

434
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,960
Kimba was a lion.

435
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,890
That was simba.

436
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,390
Kimba was first.

437
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,240
Why've you got glitter on?

438
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,400
Found this in the garage.

439
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,730
Welcome to the frame job.

440
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,410
Got some burnt skin and fabric here
on the muzzle which makes me think

441
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:47,960
that this was the gun that was pushed up
against felix's shirt when he was shot.

442
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,870
And why would I shoot my own man?

443
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,680
Maybe he was stealing.

444
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,960
Maybe he was unhappy
with his health plan.

445
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,320
And maybe there's a dead badge bunny and
all you cops just want someone to pay for it.

446
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,210
I hope that piece of
cottontail was worth it.

447
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,540
Officer stark,why don't you go
ahead and cuff up mr. Tapp here.

448
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,090
Think they brought a rope?

449
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,040
Why don't you let us take him in?

450
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:26,810
Why don't you go sleep it off
in the back of your car,sean?

451
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:32,080
Stark,what would you do if it was
your sister he shot in the back?

452
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,710
I'd go home and get drunk.

453
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,740
I can't go home.

454
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,010
You can't be here.

455
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,000
You know that.

456
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,030
Kendall was one of ours.

457
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,230
She loved us.

458
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,280
Let us take him in.

459
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,540
It's not gonna happen.

460
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,290
Are you gonna draw down on me?

461
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,000
Does it hurt that much
that you want it all over?

462
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,850
Because you take that gun
out and it's all over,sean.

463
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,190
You're a cop.

464
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,570
So are you.

465
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,260
Come on,sean.

466
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,330
Let's go.

467
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,460
You did this.

468
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,270
How--how did
you do this?

469
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,920
It was easy.

470
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,550
I just told them that
you killed a man in jail.

471
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,730
With your hands.

472
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:04,860
You did?

473
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,140
Well,that's what I told the guys.

474
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,970
What did you tell the girls?

475
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,510
Ted.

476
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,260
I'm getting married in a month.

477
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,270
I'd like you to be there.

478
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,530
we know she was a school teacher.

479
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,360
We know she loved cops.

480
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,990
We know she had no
history with narcotics.

481
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,730
Fig?

482
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,680
You want me to eat that?

483
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,170
It's the sweetest of all fruits.

484
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,850
55% sugar.

485
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,810
You know it's a fig that
the snake offered to eve?

486
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:44,820
The snake?

487
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,060
Most people think it was an apple.

488
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,120
It wasn'T.

489
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,550
It might not even have been a snake.

490
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,840
Just some kind of serpent
that led her astray.

491
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,170
We know sean dated her.

492
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:56,190
We know sean showed up last night
itching to pull his gun and end it all.

493
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,720
We know the murder weapon.

494
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,350
An unregistered gun was found.

495
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,200
And tapp,a drug dealer,was
booked into central.

496
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,160
So...

497
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,710
do we really want to keep looking?

498
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:14,550
What we don't know is how kendall
ended up down there packed with drugs.

499
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,070
Sean said they were only drinking.

500
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,450
What if they were taking drugs?

501
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:23,740
How long after you do
coke can they test for it?

502
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:29,080
You can detect the enzyme the body
makes when you do coke for 30 days.

503
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,640
Let's get a warrant for a test.

504
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:33,200
You're kind of like an expert witness.

505
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:35,940
Yeah,I kind of am.

506
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,410
Fig?

507
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,160
We're looking for your partner.

508
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,850
I haven't seen him today.

509
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,730
What do you want with
him? Maybe I can help.

510
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,150
Got a warrant here for a drug test.

511
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,750
You gonna take away his
gold medal in the 400 relay?

512
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,240
We'd rather not.

513
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,800
If he passes his blood
test,we're all done here.

514
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,380
Uh,yeah,him just taking that
test is the problem though.

515
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,320
why's that?

516
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,120
You give sean that test
now,you question him now,

517
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,910
that's just ammunition that the defense
will use to get that scumbag tapp off.

518
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:21,500
Not interested in finding out how
kendall ended up down there that night?

519
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:24,000
Not if asking those questions
puts doubt in the jury's mind.

520
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,800
No,I'm not.

521
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,810
Look,kendall's dead,okay?

522
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:33,420
Now let's put tapp away
and find some peace in here.

523
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,430
That's what a real cop would do.

524
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,160
Someone here not a real cop?

525
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,420
Hey,you tell me.

526
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,690
I mean,is that a settlement or a
badge you're wearing on your belt?

527
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,970
It is not what we carry with us,but
what we let go that defines who we are.

528
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,590
Yeah,what did you let go?

529
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,710
irish coffee?

530
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,040
You work a little whiskey in there?

531
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:56,870
Yeah,hair of the dog.

532
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,790
You want some?

533
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,770
Something you'd like to share?

534
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,860
That's what i was gonna ask you.

535
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,920
My partner has a super power.

536
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,460
You wanna guess what it is?

537
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,360
Does she fly?

538
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,200
No,tragically. Not anymore.

539
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,340
But you're getting warm.

540
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,080
all right,we're all cops
here. I'll be blunt with you.

541
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:33,500
My partner used to use. And now she
can tell when other people are using.

542
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,080
You wanna tell us something?

543
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:48,870
Yeah,I'll let sean know that
you were looking for him.

544
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,180
Do me a favor.

545
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,040
Clean up that mess when you're done.

546
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,970
You sure?

547
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:03,340
Yeah. I'm sure.

548
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,880
Okay.

549
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,610
Maybe it was an allergy
you were picking up on.

550
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,660
It wasn't an allergy.

551
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,400
Alex lauer's a solid cop.

552
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,940
He's not a suspect.

553
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,190
There's no way I can get
a warrant for a drug test.

554
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,850
Let's ask the experts.

555
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,940
Someone who could tell a
good cop from a bad cop.

556
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,210
how exactly do you do that?

557
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm not gonna show you that.

558
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,270
Maybe reese can help you out.

559
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,420
All right,let's get in there.

560
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,210
we got this.

561
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,310
What?

562
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,740
We'll let you know if we need any help.

563
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,320
But...

564
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,170
there are five badge bunnies in there.

565
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,960
Ladies,thanks for coming down.

566
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:51,480
Is this about kendall's killing?

567
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,320
We just have a few follow-up questions.

568
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,550
Questions about sean?

569
00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:00,070
I'd rather not hear my husband's
name come out of your mouth.

570
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,920
Sorry.

571
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,600
I'm sorry.

572
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,240
We're widening the investigation.

573
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,670
We're not just looking
into sean anymore.

574
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,680
We're looking into his partner too.

575
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,690
Any of you seen alex take drugs?

576
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,690
See,that's the weird part.

577
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:21,170
'Cause we found your friend full of
coke,but no one ever saw anyone using?

578
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,280
I don't know what department you're in.

579
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,640
But the guys we know
don't mess with that stuff.

580
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,400
Okay,did alex and kendall
ever spend any time together?

581
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,220
Like sex?

582
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,990
Not alex.

583
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,330
None of us spent time
with alex like that.

584
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,100
why not?

585
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,080
alex is married.He's got kids.

586
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,160
Not like sean?

587
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,580
Not like sean.

588
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,740
Diane.

589
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:46,280
Heidi said your husband's name again.

590
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,620
I'm sorry.

591
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:01,340
Is there something you'd
like to tell us about alex?

592
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,620
You think he had something
to do with that girl's death?

593
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:04,990
You tell us.

594
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,880
Is he a good cop?

595
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,410
I thought he was.

596
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,600
Why'd you change your mind?

597
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,580
Last year,I was having
a rough time with sean.

598
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,980
Didn't really know who to talk to.

599
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,880
So you talked to his partner?

600
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,620
Alex listened to me.

601
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,470
Had a few drinks,a few more.

602
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,700
At the lucky seven?

603
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:30,710
No,not there.

604
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,500
He took me somewhere else.

605
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,370
Some other bar.

606
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,560
Not the kind of place
I would usually go to.

607
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:37,950
Not a cop bar.

608
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,460
Were there drugs?

609
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,420
It was the kind of place
where you could get them.

610
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,080
I didn't do anything.

611
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,440
I don't think I did.

612
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,870
And then I did not want to be there.

613
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,500
Didn't want to be with him.

614
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,910
So you left.

615
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,090
Did alex kill that girl?

616
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,240
If he was partying with kendall,he
might've taken her there.

617
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,550
If we can put them together
on that same night...

618
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,200
diane,what was the name of
that bar alex took you to?

619
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,340
Stubb'S.

620
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,050
I know that place.

621
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,920
What do you know about that place?

622
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:15,430
I know if you go there,take antiseptic,and I
know it's around the corner from the crime scene.

623
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,710
I hate cops.

624
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,220
No offense.

625
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:26,120
Run around trying to fix everything
and you're the ones who are broken.

626
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:34,990
We called the owner.

627
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:37,050
You tend bar over at stubb's?

628
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:38,710
Walk to work.Must be nice.

629
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,270
I've gone green.

630
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,670
You know these two?

631
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:49,190
Yeah,isn't that that couple from that tv dance
contest who won all that money doing the tango?

632
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:49,910
Tango?

633
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,530
Yeah,okay.What are
you doing this weekend?

634
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,890
I was gonna organize my shoes.

635
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,020
Why?

636
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,160
Not this weekend.

637
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,760
Murder happened here.

638
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,430
You work around here.

639
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:04,770
You live around here.

640
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:05,950
You know how it happens.

641
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,250
We take you down for questioning.

642
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,460
Papers get shuffled.

643
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:09,910
You find yourself in lock-up.

644
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,370
There's an old warrant out.

645
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,240
Now you're
out in county--

646
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,470
He comes into the bar.

647
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,470
How often?

648
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,040
Was,uh,every few months.

649
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,440
Lately it's been a few times a week.

650
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,390
You know his name?

651
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,460
No.

652
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,560
He likes it when I call him boss.

653
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,260
Like,uh,"another beer,boss?"

654
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,870
How about her?

655
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,010
The other day...

656
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,050
with him.

657
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,110
They were drinking hard.

658
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,900
She was crying about breaking up
with her boyfriend or something.

659
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,300
They make any trips to the bathroom?

660
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,050
Yeah.

661
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,160
She didn't want to
go,but boss convinced her.

662
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,040
After he ran out of
cash,I asked him to leave.

663
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,000
And now I'm leaving.

664
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,400
A drunk cop with no money
and a need for drugs.

665
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:55,900
A drunk cop with no money,a
need for drugs,and a gun.

666
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,370
A few times a week?

667
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,830
Alex was on a downward spiral,but
none of his buddies knew?

668
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,710
Maybe they didn't want to know.

669
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:07,000
'Cause then they'd have
to do something about it.

670
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,690
Yeah,I guess they would.

671
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,160
We got one jittery smackhead bartender.

672
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:14,180
That's not a good eyewitness
against a career cop like alex.

673
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,540
We can get some better witnesses.

674
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,440
How's about a beer,boss?

675
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,010
Hey,two waters,please.

676
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,540
To kendall.

677
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,690
Hey,do me a favor.

678
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,040
My partner here just broke
up with her boyfriend.

679
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,430
Now don't say anything.

680
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,850
She's proud.

681
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,660
I told her not to date cops.

682
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:18,790
She wouldn't listen.

683
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,830
Women.

684
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,670
And why are you telling me this?

685
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:26,800
Because,well,'cause we heard that you're the guy
to go to when you break up with your boyfriend.

686
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,120
You know,that you have a soft shoulder.

687
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,640
We heard you took diane out when
she needed a shoulder to cry on.

688
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,920
You talking about my diane?

689
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,670
Well,whether she's your diane or
not,I think it'd be a question for her.

690
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,270
We're talking about your wife.

691
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,290
You took diane out?

692
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:46,190
I didn't take diane out,okay?

693
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,260
You might want to talk
to diane about that,sean.

694
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,970
You might want to talk to
diane about a lot of things.

695
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,670
But you should talk to her about that.

696
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,460
Took kendall out too,when she
needed a shoulder to cry on.

697
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:55,850
Kendall?

698
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,270
What about kendall?

699
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,510
All she wanted to do
was talk about you,sean.

700
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,770
And alex was there.

701
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,410
Got her all coked up,right,boss?

702
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,410
And then when there were no more
drugs,you went looking for more.

703
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,650
You rolled that dealer,and then what?

704
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:13,990
Kendall saw it.

705
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,430
She freaked,and then you freaked?

706
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:19,460
Been there.

707
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:21,490
You passed your drug test,sean.

708
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,710
You think alex'll pass his?

709
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,840
Hey,how long have we been partners?

710
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,260
Does any of this sound like me?

711
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:27,510
Come on!

712
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:34,830
You two need to go.

713
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:37,860
Yeah,okay.

714
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,340
Tight cluster!

715
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,200
Just like they taught us at the academy.

716
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,180
Remember those drills?

717
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,080
Remember the hours on the range?

718
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,190
Remember what they told us?

719
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,960
That when the time came,when we had to
shoot,we wouldn't even have to think about it.

720
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,150
We'd shoot like a cop.

721
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,740
Kendall had that pattern on her back.

722
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:07,820
Three shots.

723
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,560
Tight cluster.

724
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,680
We all had it drilled into us.

725
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,400
You didn't even have to think about it.

726
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:15,580
Just like we were trained,right?

727
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,240
Something you want to
ask your partner,sean?

728
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,040
Where's your off-duty piece,alex?

729
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,810
Here it is.

730
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:37,070
You know it's illegal to
carry an unregistered firearm.

731
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,630
Tell them that that is not my gun.

732
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,400
Tell them.

733
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,910
Tell them that that is not my gun.

734
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,670
Are--are you gonna let these two
come in here to our place and do this?

735
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,260
Seanie.

736
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,120
Good night.Lovely to see you.

737
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,120
Take me home,fin.

738
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,830
I've done enough damage for one night.

739
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:40,980
You're not fin.

740
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,940
No,I'm not fin.

741
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,530
You're charlie crews,aren't you?

742
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,740
It's a real pleasure to meet you.

743
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:49,960
I've been meaning to call you.

744
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,120
You have?

745
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,430
Yes.

746
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,530
A man like yourself.

747
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,920
You are the perfect person to help out
with some of these charities I'm into.

748
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,070
Why would that be?

749
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,390
To go through what you
did and not be broken?

750
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,520
To go through what you
did and be made better?

751
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,000
We all like to think we could do that.

752
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,920
But which one of us could?

753
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,910
I got a photo of you.

754
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:31,040
At the funeral of a
slain police officer.

755
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,550
I was a cop a long time.

756
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:35,020
There's so many of us
who gave their lives.

757
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:38,060
This photo was from jim dunn's funeral.

758
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,350
Poor jim dunn.

759
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:40,990
A suicide.

760
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,230
Many of us do go that way too,detective.

761
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,080
I think that photo
connects you to jack reese.

762
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,170
To the bank of los angeles shootout.

763
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,030
To all that missing money.

764
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,250
To my murdered friends,and to
me going to jail for 12 years.

765
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:58,100
And I think this is a kidnapping.

766
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:01,600
Kidnapping?What does that really mean?

767
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:02,930
We're not kids.

768
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,020
No one's napping.

769
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,930
We're just two guys talking.

770
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:06,970
That's all.

771
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,250
No,no,you misunderstand me.

772
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,080
This isn't a kidnapping.

773
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,130
This,detective,is a kidnapping.
