00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,350
Crews...

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,060
crews.

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,620
Crews, you here?

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,710
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Well...

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,720
what do you think?

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,070
Do you think it's a good idea?

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,910
Yeah, I think it's a good idea.

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,280
I think it's a great idea!

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,480
Think it's a very bad idea.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,510
You weren't listening, were you?

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,390
The one time that I tell you something,
and you weren't even listening.

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,900
what were you saying?

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,960
just forget it. It's not important.

15
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,040
no, it is.

16
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,300
If it weren't important, you
wouldn't say it's not important.

17
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,330
So it--it must be pretty important for
you to say that it's not important, right?

18
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:56,940
Okay, I'm thinking about
taking the lieutenant's test.

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,010
There... said iT.

20
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,840
I think that's a great idea.

21
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,460
It means you're in a confident place
in your life, ready for what's next.

22
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,920
reese, I'm happy for you.

23
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,720
Are you touching me?

24
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,010
Execution.

25
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,990
Russian ink on those arms. I
don't know about that one, but...

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,440
those twO... full-on russian mob.

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,250
I'm gonna walk the scene.

28
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,790
Mickey rayborn, this is charlie crews.

29
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,570
Detective crews. What can I do for you?

30
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,600
Funny thing.

31
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,880
The other day you told me about an F.B.I.Agent
who's in the pocket of a russian mobster.

32
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,800
One roman nevikov.

33
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,330
Maybe we shouldn't have
this discussion on the phone.

34
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,770
The funny part is that right now I'm standing
over the bodies of some dead russian wise guys.

35
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,320
So... you're thinking it
can't be a coincidencE.

36
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,980
You're thinking it's all
connected, aren't you?

37
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,960
Yeah, I am.

38
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,600
Well... then I guess you better
find out why those men are dead.

39
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,760
That is your job, isn't it?

40
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,670
Crews! You here?

41
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,830
Yeah, I'm here.

44
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,500
These two are all inked
up with russian gang tats.

45
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,540
This kid is unmarked.

46
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,330
These two look like they live
pretty hard-- lots of time outside.

47
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,520
This kid, pale as the day he was born.

48
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,260
Fingerprints are burned off with acid.

49
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,430
There are some serious
calluses on these hands.

50
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,710
These two must have
done some heavy labor.

51
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,920
This kid's hands...

52
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,020
soft as a baby'S. Never did
a hard day's work in his life.

53
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,400
None of them have I.D.

54
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,950
They all ended up executed
in a los angeles warehouse.

55
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,070
Oh, wait, I got a partial
print on this finger. It'S...

56
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,820
not much, but let's run it.

57
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,760
Crews, is it true your roommate's
back in slam for parole violations?

58
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,160
Give me your money.

59
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,490
My what?

60
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,420
Your money.

61
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,710
I--I don't
have any money.

62
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,760
Nah, I can smell money
on you. It's somewhere.

63
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,310
You want me to look?

64
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,810
You know what he means when he
says we gonna look for it, right?

65
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,850
- Guys, I don't have any money. All right?
- Yeah?

66
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,550
Hey, hey, get off of me!

67
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,300
You wanna fight? Fine. You're gonna win.

68
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,660
I've been here before.
I know how it ends.

69
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,040
I know what I look like when it's over.

70
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,750
So come on... let's get it over with.

71
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,840
Come on.

72
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,320
Are you ted earley?

73
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,090
Yeah, that's right.

74
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,480
Charlie crews says don't worry.

75
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,340
Partial print on the index finger
matched to the interpol database.

76
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,730
This guy was pyotr lavrov.

77
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,940
We're pretty sure that makes
this other one his brother dmitri.

78
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,120
The brothers lavrov were
low-level moscow wise guys.

79
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,210
Enforcement, collections, protection.

80
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,680
No record of them entering this country.

81
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,500
But they're here, and they're dead.

82
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,450
And the third guy?

83
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,860
We got nothing on hiM.

84
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,710
He could be russian, american,
or anything in between.

85
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,040
But this kid was soft.

86
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,460
This kid did not do enforcement,
collections, protection.

87
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,300
So who is he?

88
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,090
Some rich russian kid
and his bodyguards?

89
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,200
Or a kidnapping gone wrong?

90
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,410
Crews?

91
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,680
These two...

92
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,060
No one's gonna know if they're gone.

93
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,340
But this one here...

94
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,120
someone might be missing him.

95
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,040
you were the responding officer when
that russian girl was killed last year?

96
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,940
Never seen anything like it.

97
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,080
Thrown out of window.

98
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,110
And the lapd never caught who did it?

99
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,810
lapd caught him.

100
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,640
Detectives crews and
reese brought him in.

101
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,810
- But it's still an open case?
- No...

102
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,510
we caught him. Roman nevikov...

103
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,300
threw that girl out of a window.

104
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,610
And lapd proved that?

105
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,370
We had a witness who saw
roman throw her out the window.

106
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:18,540
Just so you know, before we
rescued him, that witness...

107
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,990
roman had that witness in a dog cage.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,660
A dog cage.

109
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,170
okay.

110
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,920
Yeah.

111
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,050
Okay, thanks. Looks
like we got something.

112
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,920
Missing persons report filed last week.

113
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,730
The missing person match our dead man?

114
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,200
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

115
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,530
Paul's shot?

116
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,800
Who would shoot him?

117
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,680
did you ever see him
with any of these men?

118
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:56,860
Or did he ever mention the
names dmitri or pyotr lavrov?

119
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,270
No. They're russian?

120
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,730
They were russians, yes.

121
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,610
"Were."

122
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,930
No, he never mentioned them.

123
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,120
But when he was on the
phone, he'd speak russian.

124
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,040
When he was with me, he'd speak english.

125
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,700
You don't know paul's last name?

126
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:20,380
He told me once. I--I
couldn't pronounce it.

127
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,290
Where did you meet him?

128
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,590
Here.

129
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,210
I was doing my math work on break.

130
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,890
I'm in community college.

131
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,450
He saw that i was struggling,
so he offered to help.

132
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,400
Did he help?

133
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,520
Paul has this mind, it'S...

134
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,700
was always going.

135
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,460
When he was waiting for me to work
a problem, he couldn't sit still.

136
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,920
He was working some problem too.

137
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,690
Did he take money from you?

138
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,620
No.

139
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,420
Did you ever feel like paul might
be dangerous or feel threatened?

140
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,620
No!

141
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,520
This is paul, but those questions
of yours, they're not about paul.

142
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:59,110
Paul was sweet. Paul was kind.

143
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,250
Liza, do you know where he lived?

144
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,320
He wouldn't tell me. I--I
thought he was ashamed to show me.

145
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,170
Did he say what his job was?

146
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,690

Construction.But--but--

147
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,710
what kind of construction could
he do with hands as soft as his?

148
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,840
Is that russian on there?

149
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:25,940
Did paul give it to you?

150
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,890
After we'd been together.

151
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,760
He said it was like his
good luck charm. But...

152
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:34,400
that I was his good luck charm
now, so he didn't need it anymore.

153
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,860
May we take it with us?

154
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:41,270
We'll bring it back.

155
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,940
This is the engineering prize
from moscow polytechnic institute.

156
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,590
- Pavel...
- or, as we say here, paul.

157
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,810
Rozhdestvensky won the engineering
prize three years in a row.

158
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,970
So he's not a mobster.

159
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,380
He's some kind of engineering genius.

160
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,020
Okay, what else do we know about pavel?

161
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,350
Until a few months ago, lived in
moscow, worked at the university.

162
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,600
What happened a few months ago?

163
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,830
He quit his job.

164
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,860
Is there any record of
pavel in the country legally?

165
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,250
According to immigration,
he was never even here.

166
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,660
What did liza say paul did?

167
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,790
Construction...

168
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,160
but his hands were too
soft to be a builder.

169
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,060
What did pyotr and dmitri do over there?

170
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,360
Enforcers, collection, protection.

171
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,010
Read a little deeper.

172
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,050
Enforcement, collections, protection.

173
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,680
Mostly in the construction rackets.

174
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,050
They worked in construction.

175
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,200
They worked in construction.

176
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:31,320
So we got one dead engineer
and two dead builders.

177
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,100
They were building something.

178
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,300
What were they building?

179
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,250
And why did it get 'em killed?

180
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,550
What were they building?

181
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,360
And why did it get 'em killed?

182
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,040
There was a man.

183
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,740
- Where?
- I thought it was ted, but it wasn'T.

184
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,780
Did he have a gun?

185
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,680
He was holding something.
He went down the hall.

186
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,320
Go back into your room. Go.

187
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,100
Lock the door and don't come out.

188
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,580
Oh, charlie... please don't die.

189
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,960
I won'T.

190
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,160
You shot me? You shot me!

191
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,770
Stay there.

192
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,270
Who is that?

193
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,410
- You broke into my house!
- You shot me!

194
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,780
- What the hell were you doing?
- You shot me!

195
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,890
I asked you a question.

196
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,750
I was bringing you
this! Tube was her idea.

197
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,450
Couldn't just be an envelope, no.

198
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,670
I didn't expect to find
some girl screaming.

199
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,140
I was trying to get out of here, but
this house, it's like a damn maze!

200
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,380
What's a man need with
all these hallways, anyway?

201
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,210
I couldn't find the damn door!

202
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,910
Do you know him?

203
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,170
Yeah. He's my father.

204
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,530
You shot your father?

205
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,240
I didn't know it was
him when I shot him.

206
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,260
He's, um, the...

207
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:22,810
the intruder seems to have gained
access by breaking the window on the...

208
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,780
kitchen door. You shot your own father?

209
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,030
He couldn't return the rsvp.

210
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,160
Been mailing him these
invites for almost a year now.

211
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,250
He got all this money-- what, he
can't afford to buy himself a stamp?

212
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,380
Where's your fiancee?

213
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,860
In austin, visiting her parents.

214
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,560
Who, as it turns out, she does
not feel the need to shoot at!

215
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,730
Rachel... can you...

216
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,560
I'll go with him.

217
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,160
Nah, I don't need a babysitter.

218
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,520
I'll go with him.

219
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,140
Oh, uh, this is rachel.

220
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,940
She's a friend of the family.

221
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,590
She's been staying with me for a while.

222
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,210
She's a friend of the family.

223
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,710
This is dani reese, my partner.

224
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,230
Dani reese?

225
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:15,070
Have we met? You look familiar.

226
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,620
No... I don't think so.

227
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,220
I'll call when he's checked in.

228
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,640
Thank you.

229
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,320
You're on administrative leave, so...

230
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,650
I'll be needing your weapon.

231
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:35,000
Looks like he broke in and you
were well within your rights, but...

232
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,750
he's your father, so...

233
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,510
the department will be curious.

234
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,490
Reese, find out what those
three russians were building.

235
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,980
- Big house.
- Yeah, oh!

236
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,090
Yeah, that's right. You've
never been here before.

237
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,060
Uh, it's big, I-I guess.

238
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,310
Well... I'm gonna get back
to those russian killings.

239
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,840
And you can't come.You
know, because you just--

240
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,140
- shot my father.
- Yep.

241
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,950
Yep. Yeah.

242
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,390
- Three dead russians, no I.D.
- You're on administrative leave.

243
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,080
No legal record of entry.

244
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,720
They were smuggled in-- an
engineer and two builders.

245
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,340
I'm going now.

246
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,350
Uniforms showed the photos to everyone.

247
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,480
No one knew him.

248
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,890
Liza knew pavel. Good-bye, crews.

249
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,670
No, liza knew paul.

250
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,750
Liza did not know pavel.

251
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,510
But we know a russian, don't we, reese?

252
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,400
What makes you think that
russian's gonna wanna talk to us?

253
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,930
We'll ask him nicely.

254
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,880
Cops.

255
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,150
You don't even have a gun.

256
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,220
I had it taken away.

257
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,020
He shot his father.

258
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,130
I didn't know it was
him when I shot him.

259
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,850
Still pretty messed up, I guess.

260
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,120
Anyway, if I need a gun,
I can just take yours.

261
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,780
Last time we saw roman, he
threw a woman out the window.

262
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,900
And got away with it.

263
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,520
Sorry, detectives. Invitation only.

264
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,850
But you...

265
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,200
you, I think I find space for.

266
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,880
It's your kind of party.
Do you want to see?

267
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,030
Live video.

268
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,710
That is the right now, back there.

269
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,810
Do you want to go back there right now?

270
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,780
You-- you need
invitation.

271
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,930
Oh, all I have is this.

272
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,880
No...

273
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,860
the one I sent out had two women on it.

274
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:23,200
Kissing.Cheap,
I know, but--

275
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,870
we thought if one of your
countrymen turned up dead,

276
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,810
you'd be interested to find out why.

277
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,030
Lots of russians in this city. Why me?

278
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,670
Because... you're roman.

279
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,520
Let me have photo.

280
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,790
I ask around.

281
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,510
Detective crews, I read in
paper you shoot your own father.

282
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,570
I bet you thought it was your
father crews was going to shoot.

283
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,590
What'd he y?

284
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,130
Something in russian.

285
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,680
Remember enough to get
any of it translated?

286
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,810
No... it was probably just filth.

287
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,160
"Pardon our dust"?

288
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,410
You use those signs...

289
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,750
when you're building something.

290
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,960
Here you go. Two cokes.

291
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,840
Were you open during construction?

292
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,060
No, we were closed for three weeks.

293
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,110
What'd they do to the place?

294
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,610
I can't tell.

295
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,640
They closed, covered the windows.

296
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,030
Three weeks later, we opened back up.

297
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,430
Place looks exactly the same.

298
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,780
You ask the construction workers?

299
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,760
Never saw them.

300
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:54,380
I think they may not have
been exactly legal. You know?

301
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,230
Guess they went home
when they were done.

302
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,710
Yeah, I guess so.

303
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,300
We'd like you to look at some pictures.

304
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,360
I have to go now.

305
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,570
Peek-a-boo.
I see you.

306
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,990
That is super-cool!

307
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,010
I gotta get one of
those. Where'd you get it?

308
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,240
It's after market.

309
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,130
What else does it do?

310
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,150
Now I must invoke my right
to refuse service to anyone.

311
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:26,980
Pavel the engineer worked for roman.

312
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,430
Why do you kill your own engineer?

313
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,550
Detective crews.

314
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,660
You should be more careful
with guns in your house.

315
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,490
Especially with that girl living there.

316
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,160
Someone could get hurt.

317
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,290
crews likes people living here?

318
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,290
He's got a lot of room.

319
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,300
Is it true that girl
is staying here now?

320
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,610
What girl would that be?

321
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,650
Rachel seybolt.

322
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,550
Do you think it's strange for rachel seybolt to
live with the man she thought killed her family?

323
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,290
I think...

324
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:03,320
that charlie and rachel were
both wrecked by that crime.

325
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,430
When two people go
through something, uh...

326
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,070
dark like that, uh...

327
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,620
I guess it bonds them.

328
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,090
Your dad's doing okay.

329
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,770
Bullet didn't hit anything serious.

330
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,500
But they think he can go
home in a couple of days.

331
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,930
I know. I called the hospital.

332
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,340
But you didn't call him.

333
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,780
That's my backpack.

334
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:34,220
It's time for you to go,
rachel. I'll explain in the car.

335
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,400
All I'm saying, dani, I just want you
to be careful of this roman nevikov guy.

336
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,870
Don'T... worry about me. All right?

337
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,170
I don't want it. I don't need it.

338
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,400
Just don't do it.

339
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,130
Okay.

340
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,740
- Okay.
- Okay.

341
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,360
Besides, I have my partner.

342
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,900
You're gonna give him
his gun back, right?

343
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,560
I guess so.

344
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,020
I mean, I have issues, but,
uh, to shoot your own father?

345
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,310
And he didn't seem too broken up
about it when he found out who it was.

346
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,970
If I shot my old man, I
would never stop crying.

347
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,400
Oh, wait until you meet him.

348
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:17,840
Oh, dani, he is gonna love you.

349
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,800
Uh, where do you keep your coffee?

350
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,430
In the freezer.

351
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,210
I think you'll love him too.

352
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,230
I mean, if you love me.

353
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,920
Oh, and when I say you love me,
believe me, I know you've never said it.

354
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,440
It's just an expression.

355
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,220
A ticket, a passport, and cash.

356
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,310
A lot of cash.

357
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,580
You call me if you need more.

358
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,500
There are numbers in there.

359
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,490
You need anything, you call them.

360
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,840
I don't want to go.

361
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,180
It's too dangerous for you here.

362
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,800
I can deal with what happens here.

363
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,740
You shouldn't have to deal
with what happens here.

364
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,110
I know you don't feel like
it, but you're just a kid.

365
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,910
You sending me away so I can be safe, or
you sending me away so you can be alone?

366
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,880
I know what people do when they're
alone, and it never ends up good.

367
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,160
You don't have to drive around with
a car full of bullet holes, you know.

368
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,200
Yeah, I do.

369
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,770
Maybe just for a little while longer.

370
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,080
How did we put roman
together with those killings?

371
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,140
Reese, you're... drunk.

372
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,860
Drinking, not drunk.

373
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:40,280
You didn't go there to show
him that picture of pavel.

374
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,470
You went there...

375
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:44,930
to see the look on his
face when he saw it.

376
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,940
Reese, how... long you been drinking?

377
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,970
Since... I was 12.

378
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,090
I meant today.

379
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:58,090
When we saw those three dead russians,
you stepped off to make a phone call.

380
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,990
That was about roman, wasn't it?

381
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,350
I am your superior officer.

382
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,840
Now, you will answer
my question, detective.

383
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,820
That call was about roman.

384
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,590
It was information from A...

385
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,150
a guy I knew in prison.

386
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,680
I wasn't sure, though.

387
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:22,150
That's the last time you don't tell me
what's happening when it's happening.

388
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,730
You got it?

389
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,990
Got it.

390
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,500
Reese...

391
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:35,720
you needed to drink to
ask me about roman, or.

392
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,990
ask me about something else?

393
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,900
I am drunk. Where's your bathroom?

394
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,200
- Did you sleep?
- Yeah.

395
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,510
You sober?

396
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:00,240
Yeah, you wanna ask
me any more questions?

397
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,370
You want me to?

398
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,060
See, that was a question.

399
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,780
You said, are
you gonna ask me--

400
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,680
you been riding the
desk since I took this?

401
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,630
Except for one trip to
the office supply store.

402
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,170
Out of gummi bears.

403
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,910
You are aware roman nevikov is
a federally-protected informant?

404
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,350
The feds can't find
their ass with both hands.

405
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:27,620
If nevikov killed those three
in L.A., Then lapd gets them.

406
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,650
I want you back in meetings.

407
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,420
90 meetings in 90 days.

408
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,910
90 in 90.

409
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,500
90 in 90. Copy that.

410
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,690
I thought things were going so well.

411
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,720
They were. That's when I screw up.

412
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,040
I do copy that.

413
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,460
Roman nevikov, we have a
warrant to search the premises.

414
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,620
Just the three of you?

415
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,860
The new captain, the
ex-con, and the junkie.

416
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,680
Four.

417
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,870
Okay, that's better.

418
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,470
Okay, that's more like it. Come oN.

419
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,830
Nothin'. If he was building
something, it's not there anymore.

420
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,600
Oh, you must be the grown-up.

421
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,230
Special agent bodner, F.B.I.

422
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,680
Are you all special agents,

423
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,410
because if you're all special, then none
of you are really special then, right?

424
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,640
Trust me... I'm special.

425
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,090
Don't know if your detectives told
you, but roman nevikov belongs to us.

426
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:59,210
That's funny--I thought we
were all on the same side.

427
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,980
Yeah, that is funny.

428
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,000
This is how you get your
friend ted earley out of jail?

429
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,560
You shouldn't worry about my friend.

430
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,500
What should i worry about?

431
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,650
We're here investigating the death
of a guy who worked for roman.

432
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,490
We think roman killed hiM.

433
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,380
I think that would worry
anyone who works for roman--

434
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,680
his little habit of killing
people who work for him.

435
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,490
You don't work for roman, do you?

436
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,970
You're making a mistake here.

437
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:34,300
The buddha said each
mistake is a rebirth.

438
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:38,090
Don't you wanna get reborn,
special agent bodner?

439
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,790
I know I wanna get reborn.

440
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:57,180
I have such a small piece of pie.

441
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,760
You want some more?

442
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:02,960
I don't think I'm getting seconds.

443
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,680
Bring your chow over here.

444
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,530
Give him your pie.

445
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,850
Anything else look good?

446
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,550
That bun looks pretty good.

447
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,050
Let mr. Earley have your bun.

448
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,700
How long are you in for?

449
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,960
Don't you worry.

450
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,080
I'm in for three life terms.

451
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:18,040
One for each murder.

452
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:25,000
- You ever miss it?
- What?

453
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,540
The world.

454
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:33,260
This is the world.

455
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,870
That sounds like something
charlie crews would say.

456
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,190
That's something
charlie crews taught me.

457
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,900
his real name is pavel?

458
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,300
I wish he had told me that.

459
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,910
I like that name.

460
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,040
Did you ever see him with this man?

461
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,220
Or did he ever mention the name roman?

462
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,540
No.

463
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:08,130
Liza, you see these two police officers?

464
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,770
They're just gonna stay here
a while. Just to be safe.

465
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:15,260
Liza, paul said that he
worked in construction.

466
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,060
Did he ever say what he was building?

467
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,790
He didn't like to talk about his job.

468
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,600
When he was with me...

469
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,160
- he wanted to be with you.
- Yeah.

470
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,060
What did you and paul do together?

471
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,420
He liked america.

472
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,840
The people, the energy.

473
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,860
He liked to just... go
and watch the people.

474
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,740
Where would you watch people?

475
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,960
This coffee place over on grand.

476
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:38,520
Liza, you-- you work
in a coffee store...

477
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:42,480
and you and paul would go to
another coffee store downtown?

478
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,270
He'd come here and watch.

479
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:52,910
I don't think it was people that
pavel the engineer was watching.

480
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,310
No...

481
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,510
I think pavel the
engineer was watching that.

482
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,090
You know what that is, right?

483
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,820
Yeah.

484
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,690
That's gonna be the
new federal building.

485
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,810
You said the engineer was casing the
future home of the federal building.

486
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,570
So you called the joint
terrorism task force...

487
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,990
and they sent him.

488
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:26,080
Did pavel ever take photos
of the construction site?

489
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,200
Sometimes. With his phone.

490
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,150
The workers--did he
ever talk to them?

491
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,960
Sometimes. Just casually.

492
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,610
What did they talk about?

493
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,140
Liza, what words did
they use? Do you remember?

494
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:42,460
Uh, stress loads. levels.

495
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,770
Uh, t-tolerance.

496
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:48,260
Okay, you can go. We'll speak again.

497
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,600
When the federal building is
done, it'll be completely secure.

498
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,010
If you wanna plant something in there...

499
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,370
now's the time to do it.

500
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,750
So now this does belong to us.

501
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,690
So you stay away from roman nevikov.

502
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,700
Wouldn't want anyone making a mistake.

503
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,680
Having to get... reborn.

504
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,120
Did he just threaten us?

505
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,000
So...

506
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,100
roman brings a team
from moscow. Illegally.

507
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,380
They case the federal building.

508
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,350
They build something in roman's club.

509
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,610
Something? You don't
think it was a bomb?

510
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,750
I don't know what it was. Roman knows.

511
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,880
But he's not talking.

512
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,190
Because he doesn't have to.

513
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,410
Pavel knows why.

514
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,730
But he's not talking.

515
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,900
Because he's dead.

516
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,410
You want to ask the dead
guy, don't you, crews?

517
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,790
Pavel got killed for it.

518
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,510
He wants to tell us. Roman doesn'T.

519
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,270
But, crews, he's dead. He'S...

520
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,470
I have to go to a meeting.

521
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,070
She okay?

522
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,000
No, I don't think she is.

523
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:06,060
How's your dad?

524
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:08,750
Resting comfortably.

525
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,960
Oh, I, uh, I heard
your roommate's in jail.

526
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,610
It's been a big couple of days.

527
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,490
Detective crews.

528
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,880
Roman's a terrorist?

529
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,250
Is roman a terrorist?

530
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,890
That's what I'm asking you.

531
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,430
No, that's what I'm asking you.

532
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,790
Who exactly are you?

533
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:02,470
I thought I was the guy
you wanted payback from.

534
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,900
Isn't that right?

535
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:16,470
Why do you kill the engineer?

536
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:22,060
You said paul was always
working something through.

537
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,760
Even when you were doing a problem.

538
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,710
What were you working on the
last time you were together?

539
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,830
- I was working on this.
- I'm not very good at math.

540
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,640
Neither am I.

541
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:47,780
- I like history.
- I like history too.

542
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:51,310
You got a date at the
top of the page there.

543
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:56,280
Can you show me what you were
working on three weeks ago?

544
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,280
this.

545
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,770
That's not your writing.

546
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,540
Oh, no, that's his.

547
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,360
He was always working things out.

548
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,230
These are from the hall of records.

549
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,870
Blueprints of roman's club.

550
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,080
How was your meeting?

551
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,930
Sober people telling drinking stories.

552
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,030
Pavel was studying the federal building,

553
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,050
but he was sketching
diagrams of roman's club.

554
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,730
Why would he sketch roman's club?

555
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,780
Why would he sketch roman's club?

556
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:50,030
<i>RUSSIAN HISTORY</i>

557
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:56,630
Why did the engineer have to die?

558
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,670
The russian tsars hired engineers
to build security in their palaces.

559
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,830
Walls, secret tunnels.

560
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,140
When the work was done, the
engineers knew all the secrets, so...

561
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:11,630
the engineer had to die.

562
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:16,080
The engineers knew when the job was
over, they were gonna get the ax.

563
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:18,590
So they built little trap doors.

564
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,480
Give themselves a chance.

565
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:23,290
You think pavel built
himself a trap door?

566
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,690
Well, if he did, he didn't get to it.

567
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,590
Reese. All right, thanks.

568
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,260
The cop who left with
liza didn't report in.

569
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:40,060
A unit went around to
check on them and...

570
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,730
liza and the cops were gone?

571
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,560
No! No guns!

572
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:52,380
Now, put your hands behind your heads.

573
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:56,310
Now... on your knees.

574
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,020
Isn't that how it is done?

575
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,800
That is how it is done, yes?

576
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,410
Maybe...

577
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:12,510
you wish me on my knees
too, detective new money?

578
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,640
Where is she?

579
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,530
You looking for woman, detective reese?

580
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,750
Just tell me your type.

581
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,110
You know, when the new
federal building is done,

582
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,780
it'll have more floors
underground than over?

583
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,740
And all completely secure.

584
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,160
He is deaf. She speak no english.

585
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:30,560
pavel was studying how to build
belowground in los angeles.

586
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,760
He was sketching your club.

587
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,290
You building underground there, roman?

588
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,330
There something down there?

589
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,370
Yo, you searched my club. Go on!

590
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,800
Search my club again.
I'm just a businessman.

591
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,800
Then I have a game to get back to.

592
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,430
This controls everything.

593
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:01,160
Pavel build this for you too?

594
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,650
Maybe you wanna tell me the password.

595
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,150
I heard you sent this girl rachel away.

596
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,640
Maybe... I find her.

597
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:14,340
And put my gun in her mouth.

598
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:18,770
Only it won't be my gun,
and it won't be her mouth.

599
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:25,660
Pavel the engineer built this for you.

600
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:30,610
And pavel fell in love.

601
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,600
Liza was his good luck charm.

602
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:36,020
Liza.

603
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,830
Maybe try her full name.

604
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,980
Elizabeth.

605
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,740
All you have to do is think like pavel.

606
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,960
Pavel thought in russian.

607
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:55,970
Which is hard, because I
don't know russian. But...

608
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,510
I did learn one name.

609
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,850
Elizaveta. Am I saying it right?

610
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:12,230
Eliza... veta.

611
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,780
The engineer's trapdoor.

612
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:32,170
I say this in english
because if anyone finds this,

613
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:35,040
I am hoping it is an american policeman.

614
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,370
My name is pavel rozhdestvensky.

615
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:43,010
Me and two others install
security system for roman nevikov.

616
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,970
We also installed underground vaults.

617
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,580
Hidden. It is secure.

618
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,230
Something terrible.

619
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,780
I put cameras down there.

620
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:59,100
If you are watching this, this is
what is going on there right now.

621
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:03,510
Under basement. Hidden underground.

622
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,690
He's got people down there.

623
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,080
Hidden... underground.

624
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,870
*******

625
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,330
get those people out of there right now!

626
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,230
you're making big mistake.

627
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,740
That's what I keep hearing.

628
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:36,740
Her plane landed an hour ago.

629
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,400
So she should be here any minute.

630
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,620
Yo castayas
long as you want.

631
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,250
I would have stayed in the hospital,
but they told me I had to leave.

632
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,830
Oh, it's okay.

633
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,920
You wanna talk about how much you hate
me for not letting your mom come visit you

634
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,550
when you were in jail?

635
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,080
I don't hate you.

636
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,730
You won't come to my wedding.

637
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,170
How come all you got in
your kitchen is fruit?

638
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,580
You never ate fruit when you were a kid.

639
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,970
I do now.

640
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,500
- Can I ask you a question?
- Isn't that what you just did?

641
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,430
How come your car is
full of bullet holes?

642
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,870
What does that mean, that you
drive a car full of bullet holes?

643
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,680
Is that even legal?

644
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,190
That'll be olivia.

645
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,400
I'll get it.

646
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,010
You drunk?

647
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,970
I told tidwell I
drank because, um--

648
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,360
things were going too well?

649
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:42,520
That's not why you drank, is it?

650
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:45,770
No. I...

651
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,980
- I need...
- to know something?

652
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,780
Okay, don't finish my sentences
like I'm one of our suspects.

653
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,470
Okay, you finish it.

654
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,160
I need you to tell me...

655
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:06,240
what you know about my father.

656
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:09,440
What he's done.

657
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,510
You sure?

658
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,030
Who is that?

659
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,500
It's my partner.

660
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,400
Uh, his fiancee.

661
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,620
Dani.

662
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,730
Still hurts, don't it?

663
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,790
You would think here, it
wouldn't hurt. But it does.

664
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,580
And that's just messed up.

665
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:59,140
crews, you here?

666
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,680
Crews!
