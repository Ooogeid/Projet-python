1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,480
We all thought he was guilty.

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,200
There was all that proof.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,080
A cop doing time? Please.

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,240
Broke nearly every bone in his body.

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,880
After the case was re-opened,

6
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,920
we found that none of the physical
evidence on scene matched Officer Crews.

7
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,190
As I said at the press conference, after
Detective Crews was exonerated,

8
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,960
Life was his sentence, and
life is what he got back.

9
00:00:21,995 --> 00:00:21,995
Pelican Bay Penitentiary
1998~2007

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,830
And the murdered
couple's daughter Rachel?

11
00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:24,580
Los Angeles
Four months later

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:24,615
Where was she ?

13
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,290
She was out of the house.

14
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:31,320
I guess you could say that she was
lucky but with this being her family,

15
00:00:31,355 --> 00:00:31,355
Detective Carl Ames
Lead Detective Crews murder case

16
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,760
I'm not sure the word
"lucky" correctly applies.

17
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,480
Rachel.

18
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,110
Oh, she was here.

19
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,120
<i>Let her go</i>

20
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,070
I think I might go into space.

21
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,030
Space?

22
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,300
Yeah, you can pay the Russians
to take you up there now.

23
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,070
So after spending 12
years in a box down here,

24
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,130
you're gonna pay the Russians
to put you in a box up there.

25
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,160
I think they mentioned
something about jet packs.

26
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,730
Dani Reese, homicide ?

27
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,420
Got one for you down there.

28
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,870
Yeah.

29
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,670
One of my men climbed down.

30
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,560
Didn't get a pulse off the passenger.

31
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,200
Car started to slip.

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,900
I pulled all personnel up to safe ground
till we can get a heavy crew up here.

33
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,370
What about the driver ?

34
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,400
Gone.

35
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,740
Probably drunk and fled the scene.

36
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,690
Where did your partner go ?

37
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,950
She was shot.

38
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,150
All right.

39
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,960
I'll call air support
for help with thsearch.

40
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,390
Hey.

41
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,130
Hey.

42
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,230
It must be a busy night.

43
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,420
Why do you say that ?

44
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,480
Well, I've been waiting here for a while.

45
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,720
You're a valet, aren't you ?

46
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,830
Yeah, that's right.

47
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,030
Very busy this evening.

48
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,590
Don't sweat it.

49
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,020
My wife loves this place.

50
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,670
Worth the wait.

51
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,990
She was just here.

52
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,630
Did you see where she went?

53
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,480
Probably went inside.

54
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,280
I'm just...

55
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,670
You know...

56
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,430
You're not the valet.

57
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,910
What a mess.

58
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,670
It's got GPS.

59
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,330
Global positioning satellites.

60
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,390
Thanks.

61
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,810
A ring of geosynchronous satellites
in constant contact with your car.

62
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,180
Yeah, I get Discovery channel too.

63
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,530
You see that show about crabbing ?

64
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,210
Now that's a dangerous job.

65
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,500
The bullet entered
the seat from the rear.

66
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,550
That means the gun was
red from back there.

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,230
But the entrance wound into
the woman was in her stomach.

68
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,430
Okay, how does that work?

69
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,290
So...

70
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,140
The shooter was back there.

71
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,690
The wife turned around to face him.

72
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,530
There was someone else in the car?

73
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,350
Or her husband pulled
over, climbed in the back, and...

74
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,860
Shot her.

75
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,000
- Mr. Stylman, your wife...
- Is dead.

76
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,850
They told me.

77
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,390
I know.

78
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,890
Can you tell us what happened?

79
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,610
The doctor, she said it was a car wreck.

80
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,370
Can't remember.

81
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,240
What do you remember?

82
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:45,660
We went to dinner, I got the car
from the valet, and then, uh...

83
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,170
And then?

84
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,910
And then I woke up here.

85
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,390
I didn't even drink, but
can't remeer the end.

86
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,820
My head hurts. I try to think about it.

87
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,860
It hurts so much.

88
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,260
We'd adventure-travel, you know.

89
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,910
Went hella camping in Equador last year.

90
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,550
Winter climbing in Alaska
the year before that.

91
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,670
And she dies in a car wreck.

92
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:24,250
Mr. Stylman, your wife was shot.

93
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,060
Shot ?

94
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,500
I don't understand what you're saying.

95
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,860
It was a car wreck.

96
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,360
Shot once.

97
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,150
They said it was a car wreck.

98
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,580
Peter.

99
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,390
Peter, look at me.

100
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,440
Good. That's good.

101
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,040
Stay here.

102
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,990
Tell me what happened in your car.

103
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,830
Head hurts so much.

104
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,470
Peter, tell me what happened in your car.

105
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,480
You went to the valet and got your car.

106
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,460
Yes.

107
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,780
Then you were driving.

108
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,810
- I always drive, even when it's...
- No, it wasn' her car.

109
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,870
It was your car.

110
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,230
Peter, tell me what happened in your car.

111
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:39,620
When I go home, I have to tell the
children that their mother is dead.

112
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,661
He was still in prison when you got out?

113
00:06:47,696 --> 00:06:49,832
Yeah. He'deen in for
eight years wh we met.

114
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,420
Ted Earley
Financial Advisor to Charlie Crews

115
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:53,560
Served two more, uh, after I got out,

116
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,540
and he found me when he was released.

117
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,700
Found you ?

118
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,170
Yeah, I wasn't, um...

119
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,220
Isn't doing so well.

120
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:09,530
Uh, so he found me and asked me if I
would handle his, uh, settlement money.

121
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,410
I'm prohibited from handling public
funds, but this is private, so...

122
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:17,930
Do you think it's smart for him to let a
convicted felon handle his settlement money?

123
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,820
I'm not sure I like that question.

124
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,710
Hello.

125
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,230
we have a problem.

126
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,110
Everything okay ?

127
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,260
There was a coyote by the patio.

128
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,410
Kept me in the pool for over an hour.

129
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,400
I am still suffering...
...side effects.

130
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,170
A coyote during the day ?

131
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,890
These things have no fear of people.

132
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,180
They're insane.

133
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,380
I used to get coyote calls all the
time on patrol, but only at night.

134
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,360
Well, they're obviously
getting more brazen.

135
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,100
Brazen? Huh.

136
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,490
Sure it wasn't just a dog?

137
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,150
It was a mangy predator, and I
don't want it prowling around.

138
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,260
I mean, what if it
attacks a neighbor's kid?

139
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,860
Did you feed it?

140
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,770
No, but Mrs. Bellfield's cat is missing.

141
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,180
They ate it, Charlie.

142
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,640
They ate her cat.

143
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,330
Yeah. Okay.

144
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,110
Look, I gotta go.

145
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,960
Can we talk about this when I get home ?

146
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,130
You got a pest problem ?

147
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,860
He's not so bad.

148
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,700
Peter Stylman drove to work
yesterday, same as every day.

149
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,700
Came home on time, picked
up his wife Shelby.

150
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,660
They went to dinner at
the cove restaurant here.

151
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,880
Left the restaurant at 9:45.

152
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,010
That's confirmed by
waiters as well as the GPS ?

153
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,560
And the valet too.

154
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,390
Driving home, they made one stop, this
ramp off the 110, a gas station,

155
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,100
but they didn't gas.

156
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,320
Their tank was almost empty.

157
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,560
Detective Deese, Homicide.

158
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,170
Is someone dead ?

159
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,550
A lot of people are dead.

160
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,290
Eventually, everyone.

161
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,550
A car crashed shortly after
stopping here last night.

162
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,270
A female passenger was shot.

163
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,570
That's terrible.

164
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,690
Who shot her ?

165
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,310
Someone with a gun.

166
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,600
Look, I admire a question
answered with a question, I do,

167
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,470
because there is no
answer, only questions,

168
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,230
but I'd like you to try really
hard to give us an answer anyway.

169
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,380
We'll start with an easy one, okay ?

170
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,410
Do you work here alone?

171
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,710
Yes.

172
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,810
So when we take you
downtown for questioning,

173
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,530
you'll have to close up
and lose all that business.

174
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,050
I remember, okay ?

175
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,830
I remember, 'cause, you
know, he put his card in,

176
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,790
but then he didn't
pump nothing, you know ?

177
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:34,250
So I look out, and they were
talking to this big latino dude.

178
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,010
You know, he was all tatted up.

179
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,140
Real big.

180
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,490
You saw them drive off together ?

181
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,170
Another customer came in, you know ?

182
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,720
I didn't see where they went.

183
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,020
Didn't it make you curious?

184
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,910
Look, I try not to get involved, you
know it's dangerous out there.

185
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,800
You should try crabbing.

186
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,740
Detective Carl Ames
Lead Detective Crews murder case

187
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:55,075
Yeah, I worked that case.

188
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,650
Took my 20 right after we closed it.

189
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,370
And no dna is gonna tell
me we got the wrong guy.

190
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,950
Have you see Detective Crews
since his release from prison ?

191
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,280
Now why would I want to do that?

192
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,170
you looking for an apology?

193
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,190
Just looking for a beer, Detective.

194
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,240
Beer ?

195
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,360
You know, we just run out.

196
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,060
Well, maybe then I'll just have a soda.

197
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,520
Run out of soda too.

198
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,630
You got no right to be in here.

199
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,020
This is where I drink.

200
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,000
Wanted to thank you.

201
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,860
You know, before I went away,

202
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:55,520
I never really appreciated
my life, my job, my wife,

203
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,430
but now, now I know.

204
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:06,940
I know that every day I spend above
ground is a reason to celebrate.

205
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,130
Why couldn't you have
just died in there ?

206
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,790
That would have been too easy.

207
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,950
Rachel was in the house.

208
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,810
She was there when it happened.

209
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,240
Next round's on me.

210
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,845
The daughter rachel, where was she?

211
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,650
Detective Carl Ames
Lead Detective Crews murder case

212
00:12:52,065 --> 00:12:52,065
She was at a sleepover.

213
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,650
How many times I gotta tell you that ?

214
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,610
Don't remember anything
about what happened.

215
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,520
We talked to your car.

216
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,620
You talked to my car ?

217
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:05,180
We retraced your steps using GPS.

218
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,940
You stopped at a gas station
on your way home from dinner,

219
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,710
where a very large latino
man approached you.

220
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,980
We haven't been able
to identify him yet.

221
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,210
He kept his back to the gas
station security cameras.

222
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,310
My head is hurting.

223
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,210
Just leave me alone.

224
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,380
Do you know what trepanning is, Peter ?

225
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:26,780
No.

226
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,510
It was an ancient cure for head pain.

227
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,730
They thought the pain was
caused by spirits in your head,

228
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,830
so they would drill a hole in
your skull to let the spirits out.

229
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,400
Do we have to drill a
hole in your head, Peter ?

230
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,860
Why would you say something like that ?

231
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:42,040
What kind of person
says something like that ?

232
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,730
It's gonna hurt when you look inside and
remember what happened to you and to your wife.

233
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,370
My wife is dead.

234
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,000
No, She's still dying.

235
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,590
Now tell us what happened
in that car and let her go.

236
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,480
There was this guy.

237
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,590
He came up to us.

238
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,330
He had a gun, and...

239
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,900
He told me to ge in the car and drive.

240
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,700
But Shelby, she couldn't calm down.

241
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,120
He kept waving his gun.

242
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,840
She was gonna get herself killed.

243
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,730
And I reached for it.

244
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:46,800
I fought with him, ani
got my hand on the gun,

245
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,170
and Shelby turned around and I see...

246
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,120
That the gun went off.

247
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,080
He just jumped out, and I drove fast.

248
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,050
She was bleeding.

249
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,820
She was dying.

250
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,780
I put my hand over her wound.

251
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,000
I lost control.

252
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,440
Why would you want me to remember that?

253
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,070
Prints came back from inside the car.

254
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:45,710
Manny Umaga, several time for carjacking, grand
theft author, and assault with a deadweapon.

255
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,330
Your driver i. d. him?

256
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,130
Umaga's actually a samoan, not a latino.

257
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,130
We've been looking at
the wrong mug shots.

258
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,280
Do we believe Stylman's sudden recall?

259
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,770
That he blocked it out 'cause of
what, guilt that he got his wife killed ?

260
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,230
We're gonna pick up umaga, see what he has
to say about what happened in that car.

261
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,370
Suspect's been out four months.

262
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,680
What's his p. o.* say ?

263
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,920
Hasn't checked in in weeks.

264
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,260
Totally m. i. a.*

265
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,240
We got a list of known associate

266
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,490
Go get him.

267
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,450
Nice teamwork, you two.

268
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,960
Buscando Maldito ?

269
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,710
Ins* hiring mels these days ?

270
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,720
Yo, don't you look at my ride.

271
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,530
Do not look at his ride.

272
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,110
You could not handle my ride.

273
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,370
You could not handle his ride.

274
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,260
Rbo baby, bored out.

275
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,010
Custom gears, performance chip, and
a hand-built throttle box.

276
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,940
Hand-built throttle box.

277
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,410
That one's pimp daddy.

278
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,380
Does it have GPS ?

279
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,130
You don't want that.

280
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,710
The man ack you like a dog with gps.

281
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,330
Like a dog.

282
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,370
Yeah. Yeah, you're
right, I don't want that.

283
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,360
The man'll track me with that.

284
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,170
Crews, you are the man.

285
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,810
Oh, yes.

286
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:31,060
Yeah, right. I am the man.

287
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,030
We need to ask you a few questions.

288
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,550
You know what I would love ?

289
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,790
I would love to airbrush
you on the hood of my car.

290
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,770
What do you see on her belt ?

291
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,230
A gun.

292
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,270
What else ?

293
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,900
A badge.

294
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,320
A woman wearing a gu and a badge
asks you a question, answer it.

295
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,840
Are you sure you're the man ?

296
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,300
We're looking for Manny Umaga.

297
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,800
Oh, that fool?

298
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,630
11 grand that vato owes me.

299
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,080
Vato owes him 11 grand.

300
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,160
Do you know where he is ?

301
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,560
I know exactly where he is.

302
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,370
And I'll do you one better.

303
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,320
We'll come with you.

304
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,480
Like a posse ?

305
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,310
Yeah.

306
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,680
What ?

307
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,130
We'll flush him out.

308
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,220
Right when he sees me, he'll
be sure to go for his piece.

309
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,520
You'll be all set up on him.

310
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,830
Bam !

311
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,340
You shoot him dead.

312
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,460
And we say, "Oh, it was a clean shoot. "

313
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,680
Bam.

314
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,180
Done.

315
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,820
I think we can handle it.

316
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,390
Lapd !

317
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,630
Get a paramedic up here.

318
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,210
Drop it !

319
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,680
I said, drop it !

320
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,930
Drop your weapon !

321
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,990
I said, drop it !

322
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,240
Hands in the air!

323
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,010
Flash-bangs, huh?

324
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,880
Good for aggravated assault, maybe
even attempted murder.

325
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,140
There's a lot of guys after me.

326
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
I didn't know it was the police.

327
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,980
Is that poor cop all right ?

328
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,880
Yeah. You can send him flowers.

329
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,550
Interrogation one.

330
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,240
Did you find the gun ?

331
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,670
We need it to make the murder ironclad.

332
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,590
The carjacking victim's
coming in to i.d.

333
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,180
You got him ?

334
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,870
You'll tell us.

335
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,490
I'm not sure.

336
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,860
All right, take another look, Peter.

337
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,700
It's not him.

338
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,510
Are you sure ?

339
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,430
No, I... It
could be-

340
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,590
Mr. Stylman, is this the
man that carjacked you ?

341
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,010
I don't...
Maybe.

342
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,210
That's not the man who shot your wife ?

343
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:09,980
No.

344
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,110
That's not the man who killed your wife ?

345
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,680
No, no.

346
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,530
I wish it was, but it's not.

347
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:27,850
I used to think, what
if I had believed him.

348
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,370
What if I hadn't walked away?

349
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,610
Would he be here now ?

350
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,410
We would have come
through this together.

351
00:22:35,365 --> 00:22:36,365
We would have won.

352
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,350
Jennifer Conover
Ex-wife of Charlie Crews

353
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:41,440
But I didn't believe him,

354
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,410
And I've learned it's
better not to think that way.

355
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,290
There was 500 pounds of samoan
in the back of Stylman's car,

356
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,280
and he blocked it out ?

357
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,690
Am I the only one who thinks that's odd ?

358
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:52,850
No.

359
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,260
We think it's odd too.

360
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,580
We think that's odd too.

361
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,090
So why won't Stylman i. d. Manny ?

362
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,110
You think it was a set-up ?

363
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:08,610
Stylman arranged to have his wife killed, hired
big boy, and made it look like a carjacking.

364
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,330
So failed to i. d. The shooter
is part of the quid pro quo.

365
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,450
Quid pro quo.

366
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,630
Stop it.

367
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,010
Stop what ?

368
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,090
Why won't you i. d. the shooter ?

369
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,420
You know what it looks like ?

370
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,610
It looks like you hired
Manny to kill your wife,

371
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,830
but then make it look like a carjacking.

372
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,630
Is this how you treat all your victims ?

373
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,950
Interrogating them, making them feel
like criminels when you've
supposedly got the killer ?

374
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,210
A killer that we can't prosecute
because you won't i. d. him.

375
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,580
I can't remember.

376
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,990
Do you want me to say it
was him when it wasn't ?

377
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:47,580
We've got motive if Stylman wants out of
the marriage but divorce isn't enough.

378
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,280
If we tie him to Manny, we
can put them both away.

379
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,440
I want you to give me your knife.

380
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,030
My knife ?

381
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,350
Why ?

382
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,830
Because I want to swear
a blood oath with you,

383
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,440
and I need something to cut my pinkie.

384
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:03,370
Give me your knife or
I burn you with i. a. d.

385
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,770
For not using your service
weapon when you should have.

386
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,670
I need to know that my
partner is a cop and not a con.

387
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,410
Anything else you
carrying from the old days ?

388
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,020
Sharpened toothbrush ?

389
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,330
Light bulb full of bleach ?

390
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,590
Charlie.

391
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,810
Hey. Everything all right?

392
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,760
Constance Griffith.

393
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,600
Oh, sorry.

394
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,920
Charlie's lawyer?

395
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,650
Yeah.

396
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,990
Dani Reese.

397
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,080
Charlie's partner.

398
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,510
We'll pick this up tomorrow.

399
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,270
What brings you down here ?

400
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:19,060
So I heard something that I didn't
believe, I didn't want to believe,

401
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,060
so I thought I would come down
here and ask you about it myself.

402
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:22,750
Wait.

403
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,110
You mean the knife thing ?

404
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,940
What knife thing ?

405
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,950
I'm talking about you violating
the terms of your settlement.

406
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,160
My settlement has terms ?

407
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,630
You went to see Ames, Charlie ?

408
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,000
I went out for a beer.

409
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,170
You talked to Ames ?

410
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,800
It's a free country.

411
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,530
I don't have to tell you that's the
law the law of the land is freedom.

412
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,870
Yes, that's the law, but the money
and the badge are not the law.

413
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,240
The money and the badge
are the settlement.

414
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,500
How did you find out about this?

415
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,750
This guy is retired lapd.

416
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,250
You go near his house, you go
near him, and he'll shoot you.

417
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,800
You understand.

418
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,840
I wanted him to see my face.

419
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:11,920
Take your money
and... And go.

420
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,060
You deserve it.

421
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,250
Is that what you want ?

422
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,990
Do you want me to go ?

423
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:36,040
Then lie to me, and... And tell
me that you'll be careful.

424
00:26:54,020 --> 00:27:01,190
did she see?

425
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,010
Charlie.

426
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,700
Do you hear those coyotes ?

427
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,140
I hate to bother you,

428
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,550
But it sounds like we have a
whole pack of them out there now.

429
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,650
That's where they belong.

430
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,790
Well, I can't sleep.

431
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,060
They're taunting me, Charlie.

432
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:30,460
Do you know that native
americans considered coyotes

433
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:37,620
to be
tricksters, scavengers, thieves, shape-shifter.

434
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,700
They're survivors.

435
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,760
And you know what's amazing ?

436
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,110
Coyotes are the only indigenous north
american animals to have proliferated

437
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,350
since the europeans settled here.

438
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,430
They're used to being
subordinated to bears and wolves,

439
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,240
but since we've eliminated those top
predators, they've actually excelled.

440
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,460
You're not making me feel any better.

441
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,530
I want you to feel better.

442
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,240
Should I call the animal control?

443
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:11,200
They're not gonna do anything
about creatures living in the hills.

444
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,720
Creatures ?

445
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,910
Ted.

446
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:21,330
Domestic dogs have
killed hundreds of people.

447
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,250
Nobody's ever been killed by a coyote.

448
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,810
Yet.

449
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,480
Jennifer Conover
Ex-wife Charlie Crews

450
00:28:34,515 --> 00:28:35,350
After the divorce from
Charlie, you remarried ?

451
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,460
Three years after. Yes.

452
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,920
And you have children with
your new husband?

453
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,520
Two children. A boy and a girl.

454
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,360
And what do you tell your
children about your first husband?

455
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,930
We don't talk about that.

456
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,710
All right, this has gotta stop.

457
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:57,930
Step out of the car, please.

458
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,300
Charlie.

459
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,290
Step out of the car, please.

460
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,450
Charlie, if you have a
problem with me, deal with me.

461
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,810
You have to stop doing this.

462
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,680
Sir, you were driving in
excess of the speed limit.

463
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:10,070
I need you to step out
of the car right now.

464
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,120
- Drive away from him.
- He's a cop.

465
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,520
Drive away from him now, Mark.

466
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,880
If you don't step out
of the car right now,

467
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,500
I'm gonna get highway patrol down
here, and they're gonna drag you out.

468
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,150
This is ridiculous.

469
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,190
It's ridiculous.

470
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,680
It's juvenile, what you're doing.

471
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,380
How are the kids ?

472
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,580
You don't care about my kids.

473
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,380
They could have been our kids.

474
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,510
What do you want, Charlie?

475
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:50,160
I want to be the un-wobbling pivot at the
center of an ever-revolving universe.

476
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,800
I want to be still.

477
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,390
What do you want here, Charlie ?

478
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,980
I want to know where she is.

479
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,970
Leave her alone, charlie.

480
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,730
Where is she ?

481
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:11,130
This is the first time
you've seen me in 12 years,

482
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,380
and that's all you want to say ?

483
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,850
That's all I want to say.

484
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,950
She's gone.

485
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,690
Her family died, and she got a new one.

486
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,240
They changed her name.

487
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,520
Don't ask me what it is.

488
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,750
I don't know.

489
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,450
She's gone.

490
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,590
And don't you dare try to find her.

491
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,480
Just leave her alone.

492
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,390
Please get out of my husband's car.

493
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:57,290
We've got you jacking the victims at
the gas station across the street.

494
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,040
The owner picked you out of a mug book.

495
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,190
Okay.

496
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,080
I was in the car, but not like you say.

497
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,150
I didn't shoot the bitch.

498
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,080
Oh, who did ?

499
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,980
Her own man.

500
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:08,800
Stylman ?

501
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,810
The driver.

502
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,160
I was gonna jack 'em.

503
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:14,620
They both got out of the car, had to use
the can or ask for directions, I don't know.

504
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,580
So I creeped in the back seat.

505
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,630
They was so involved, they never saw me.

506
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,450
He popped her.

507
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,040
I got scared and ran.

508
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,740
How much you weigh?

509
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,310
530.

510
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,010
And they didn't notice you in the back?

511
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,740
Who's getting jacked now ?

512
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,070
- Beverly Hills shot his wife, not me !
- Sit down !

513
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:36,270
If I shot her like you
say, why he don't say that ?

514
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,500
'cause I'm innocent !

515
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,420
Sit down !

516
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,360
- Help ! Help !
- I didn't touch you.

517
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,450
- Sit down !
- That crazy cop !

518
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,910
He pulled a knife on me before !

519
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,930
Keep him away from me !

520
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,230
Help ! Help !

521
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,120
Help ! Help !

522
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,650
- I didn't touch you
- That crazy cop !

523
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,440
He pulled a knife on me bef...

524
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,530
Tell me you're not buying this.

525
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,660
About you hurting him ?

526
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,120
Of course not.

527
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,540
About you pulling a knife ?

528
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:09,070
Will all due respect, Lieutenant, the
suspect is full of crap.

529
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:13,270
Are you saying Detective Crews did
not pull a knife on Manny Umaga?

530
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,040
He did not.

531
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,990
That's not true.

532
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:22,820
She's lying.

533
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,930
She's lying protect me, because
that's what partners do,

534
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,010
and we're partners now.

535
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,320
But don't do that for me.

536
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,900
You pulled a knife on a suspect ?

537
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,730
He pulled one first.

538
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,790
Bring the husband backown here.

539
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,310
- Ma'am, I'd like to...
- You're both backing up your partner.

540
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,260
I get it.

541
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,300
I also get we have an unsolved homicide.

542
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:43,160
Cut Umaga loose before
we get hit with a lawsuit.

543
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:05,210
But just make sure you have enough to go all
the way around the other side of the pool, okay?

544
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,230
Yes, Sir.

545
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,280
Thanks.

546
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,520
Hey.

547
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,270
What do you think ?

548
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,710
A fence ?

549
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:25,000
I got a fantastic
deal... $12 a foot.

550
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:28,340
Now coyotes can jump, but I figure
eight feet ought to be enough.

551
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,740
A fence ?

552
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,300
Yeah.

553
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,320
Hey, guys, uh...

554
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,770
Take it down.

555
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:52,100
Manny says Stylman did it.

556
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:55,800
Stylman says Manny
wasn't even in the car.

557
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,190
Manny is a career
criminal, and Stylman...

558
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,590
Is a good family man.

559
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,340
Or at least he was.

560
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:07,260
Up until three days ago, Stylman
was a good husband, a good father.

561
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,480
What happened in that
car that he won't tell us ?

562
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,990
That he can't tell us?

563
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,620
We have to use his own
strength against him.

564
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,850
His strength? What's his strength?

565
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,620
His weakness.

566
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,060
His weakness is his strength?

567
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:22,990
Exactly.

568
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,250
It's like the one-handed clap.

569
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,190
Are you really zen ?

570
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,900
I'm zen-ish.

571
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,410
You want in on this?

572
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,740
My mother-in-law is taking my
kids with her after the funeral.

573
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,720
Taking them where ?

574
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,880
Back to Fresno to live with her.

575
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,240
You're giving your kids away?

576
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,990
They'll be better off.

577
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,380
That should work out pretty well.

578
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,610
What do you mean ?

579
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:15,220
Well, Peter, you're gonna need
someone to take care of them.

580
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,610
We've come her to arrest you.

581
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,890
We have a witness who
saw you shoot your wife.

582
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,760
I didn't shoot her.

583
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,630
I tried to save her.

584
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,660
The man in the car shot her.

585
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,480
You fought for her ?

586
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,350
Yes.

587
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,460
But you won't fight for your kids ?

588
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,670
I fought for her.

589
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,590
You fought that monster manny,

590
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,240
but you can't be there for your kids ?

591
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,740
Why are you giving them away ?

592
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,760
I fought for her.

593
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,320
What are you ashamed of ?

594
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,040
- You pushed me.
- Did I ?

595
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,730
Crews.

596
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:03,240
Now that was a one-handed clap.

597
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,130
I didn't.

598
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,290
I didn't fight him.

599
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,170
I just said, "Give him whatever he
wants, just as long as he didn't kill us. "

600
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,900
I said I had ten grand
in a lockbox upstairs.

601
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,190
Here ?

602
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,540
I told him I had the money in the house.

603
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,200
Where your kids were ?

604
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,900
I was so scared, I told him
I had the money in my house.

605
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,760
I wasn't thinking about my children.

606
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,300
And what did your wife do?

607
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,900
Shelby was furious.

608
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,600
Bringing a gunman home.

609
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,540
She...

610
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,750
Went for the gun.

611
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:15,120
That should have been me.

612
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,080
I tried to speed to the
hospital, but I screwed that up too.

613
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:23,070
She died knowing I wasn't even a man.

614
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,950
I wasn't a man that night.

615
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,140
And I'm gonna have to live with that.

616
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,980
But I'm gonna be one to my kids.

617
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,250
It's what she would have wanted.

618
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,610
I asked you to leave me alone.

619
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,640
You didn't listen to me.

620
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:20,300
You know, I bet he lived his whole
life thinking if it ever came down to it,

621
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,630
he'd be the hero.

622
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,130
Don't you think like that?

623
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:27,200
Even if he id's
Manny, it's not gonna stick.

624
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,230
A jury will never believe him.

625
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,920
He's changed his story too many times.

626
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,760
Too many times.

627
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,860
Our killer is gonna walk.

628
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,690
He's gonna walk.

629
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,850
Didn't I tell you stop that ?

630
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,560
Didn't I?

631
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,840
If Manny's gonna walk, we
might as well give him a ride.

632
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,080
Amigo !

633
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,880
Give me one lucky lucky.

634
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,490
Hey, what's up, Manny ?

635
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:57,300
Hey, you know, I heard you got busted.

636
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,180
You beat it?

637
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,120
Yeah. You know cops can't hold me.

638
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,170
Hey, so we should celebrate.

639
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,900
You want to come with us and celebrate ?

640
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,780
I think I'm okay.

641
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,210
Oh, no, man, you're not okay.

642
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,980
You want to celebrate with us.

643
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,500
Come on, manny.

644
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,320
Mira, donde esta mi dinero ?

645
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,630
Where's my 11 grand ?

646
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,500
Don't hassle me. I'll get you the money.

647
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,280
You're out of time, bro.

648
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,370
Out of time.

649
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,070
Look, man, I just jacked some dude.

650
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:24,440
Had him crying so bad, he
said he had ten grand at home.

651
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,230
Take me there, i'll split it with you.

652
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,130
Yeah, but you see, you owe me 11.

653
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,110
11.

654
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,830
I killed her for nothing.

655
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:33,050
Imagine what i'm gonna do to you.

656
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,460
Yo, Francisco, musica.

657
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,990
Yo, you're gonna love this sound, manny.

658
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,650
I put the system in myself.

659
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,910
Check it.

660
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,780
I killed her for nothing.

661
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,840
Imagine what i'm gonna do to you.

662
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,210
No knife this time, Manny.
