3
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,610
Exterminator found him.

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,680
Setting traps at the neighbor's house.

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,220
- That's when he saw it.
- "It?"

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,190
Is it an "it" or a "him?"

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,320
It's kinda both.

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,740
Rat guy said he thought it
was a soccer ball or a pumpkin.

9
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,650
- That's not a soccer ball.
- Or a pumpkin.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,580
you canvass the neighborhood?

11
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,630
knocked on doors,but guess what?

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,190
No one saw anything.

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,030
Oh,it's not just the head.
He's still in one piece.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,370
Body's buried underneath him.

15
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,350
Looks like he's been dead about a day.

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,370
Flower petals. Dianthus.

17
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,580
I happen to know flowers.

18
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,900
You ever see one like this before?

19
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,500
You mean made out of a man?

20
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,200
Someone made him into a flower.

21
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,410
and left him here on this lawn.

22
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,460
You send flowers,it usually
means one of two things.

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,390
You're really in love,or
you're really sorry.

24
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,000
Which one is it?

27
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,610
Diabetic. Frank dunlop.

28
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,510
Frank took a bullet to his chest
at close range before he was buried.

29
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,360
You get some real perspective
when your head is down here.

30
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,440
Is that-- is that
frank's dinner?

31
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,060
Label has yesterday's date.

32
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,300
Salisbury steak,peas,and
apple brown betty?

33
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,190
Oh,diabetics shouldn't
eat apple brown betty.

34
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,930
Beverly hills cares?

35
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,170
Let's see if it's true.

36
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,350
Frank was our best driver.

37
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,440
Totally committed to
others,never missed a day of work.

38
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,700
He was a saint.

39
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,250
Can we get a list of his deliveries?

40
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,910
Sure.

41
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,550
Frank lived for this place.

42
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,880
Always looking to make it better.

43
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,250
Um,last week he found a way
to raise a ton of money for it.

44
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,030
He say how?

45
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,250
No,but he wasn't just a talker.

46
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,100
If he said that he
had a way,he had a way.

47
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,990
He ever mention any
problems with his deliveries?

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
He never complained.

49
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,560
And he was the one who ran
food to all the crazies.

50
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,320
The crazies?

51
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,900
Like sketchy people,troublemakers.

52
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,030
Frank actually seemed to like them.

53
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,600
Any live near north valley circle?

54
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,480
I got...

55
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,920
two on vista vierra.

56
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,830
That's near valley circle,right?

57
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:17,510
I got a flint garber on 1818 vista
vierra,and a maude paxton on...

58
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,400
1818 vista vierra.

59
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,880
Yes?

60
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,210
Are you maude paxton?

61
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,460
I am,have you brought the food?

62
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,230
No,we haven'T.

63
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,210
Actually,we're here about the person
who brings the food. May we come in?

64
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,880
Of course.

65
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,060
Has something happened to frank?

66
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,410
Where the hell's my food?

67
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,770
- Flint garber.
- Who are you?

68
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,420
How do you know my name?
Did you bring my food?

69
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,270
They know your name?

70
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,580
Flint,they're here about frank.

71
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,970
I'm detective reese,and
this is detective crews.

72
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,780
You just let anybody in the house.

73
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:11,250
we'd like to ask you some,uh-- we'd
like to talk to you about frank dunlop.

74
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,060
Well,frank didn't show up today.

75
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,740
Does that mean I don't get my food?

76
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,280
When was the last time you saw frank?

77
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,450
The day before yesterday.

78
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,820
He comes every day.

79
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,820
You'd never met a
sweeter soul than frank.

80
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,440
Can we ask where you were last night?

81
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,510
You can ask. Free country.

82
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,800
He was here. He's always here.

83
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,380
Always? You never leave?

84
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:37,470
Can'T. Nobody steal my
stuff. Valuable stuff.

85
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,920
And maude,where were you last night?

86
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,790
Here too. We were watching the tv.

87
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,850
It was my turn with the remote.

88
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,480
- Oh,we're roommates.
- Yeah,just roommates.

89
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,210
So now look,if you don't have any food for
me,you just get the hell off my property.

90
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,050
The two roommates flint garber and
maude paxton are both clean slates;

91
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,250
no rap sheets on either.

92
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,470
Frank dunlop's clean too.
Not even a parking ticket.

93
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,760
Maybe this guy really was a saint.

94
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,790
- Only one saint walked this earth.
- Who's that?

95
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,860
- My mother.
- His mother.

96
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,900
I searched the vi-cap database.

97
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,610
The last murder listed with
dianthus on the victim was in um--

98
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,530
the '70s.Johnny hazlit.

99
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,720
Weird cult,the hazlits.

100
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,870
Killed ten people,never got convicted.

101
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,140
Hazlit overdosed on drugs in 1972.

102
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,440
What about the rest of the hazlits?

103
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,260
The ones we can trace are
either in prison or dead.

104
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,640
But a lot of 'em just went
underground and disappeared.

105
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,260
Okay. No leaks,no press.

106
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,440
If the press hears that the hazlits are
still out there,or there's a copycat,

107
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,640
all hell breaks loose and
we'll never solve this.

108
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,460
Get online and get me
everything you can about hazlit.

109
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,310
There won't be a lot in the database
from back then. It's ancient history.

110
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,300
Well,okay,you two are off
to lapd dead record storage.

111
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,370
Why go there when we can go
somewhere where history comes alive?

112
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,340
los angeles museum of murder and mayhem.

113
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,550
Lamomam.

114
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,150
People actually pay to see this?

115
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,110
Maybe we don't see the value
because we get it for free.

116
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,570
And you knew about this place because...

117
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,040
came here on a date once.

118
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,920
It was her idea.

119
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,650
"Guitar said to have been given to
johnny hazlit by donovan in 1968."

120
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,350
They called him "mellow yellow."

121
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,490
Johnny hazlit's personal teddy bear.

122
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,760
I'm the one who acquired that
piece from a collector in japan.

123
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,970
Can we help you with something?

124
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,040
Are you the owners?

125
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,730
Yes,I'm squeaky. This is tex.

126
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,910
We met at a ted bundy auction.

127
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,610
- He outbid me.
- but she seduced me.

128
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,130
I paid for the guitar.

129
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,130
How much of this stuff is real?

130
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,990
We're very precise about the
provenance of everything here.

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,270
- Provenance?
- Yes,an object's place of origin.

132
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,200
Proof that it is what it is.

133
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,290
Any of the "its" here
a .45 caliber handgun?

134
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,120
No. Famous murder guns
are too expensive for us.

135
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,670
They start around 10,000
and go up from there.

136
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,750
$10,000 for a gun?

137
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,290
- Well,a gun that killed somebody.
- Provenance.

138
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,110
mass murder memorabilia is
a huge and growing market.

139
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,410
Sadly,very little comes on the market.

140
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,730
Most collectors are private.

141
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,010
Japanese eat it up.

142
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,820
but they keep their
collections to themselves.

143
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,050
We'd like to look at your archives.

144
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,230
Because you're homicide detectives?

145
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,920
He's charlie crews.

146
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,050
Two murders short of
making the mass murder room.

147
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,420
We have a minimum of five.

148
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,000
Actually,I was five murders short.

149
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,820
she means before you were innocent.

150
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,470
Or before we knew you were innocent.

151
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,810
Of course,there's talk
of what you did in prison.

152
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,510
There's talk about a lot of things.

153
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,160
Ever see this guy before?

154
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,280
Uh,no. Is he a murder victim?

155
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:20,010
You're homicide detectives.
Asked about the gun.

156
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,000
feel free to look around for a while.

157
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,740
We are a museum. We want you to look.

158
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:44,560
Hazlit used dianthus to decorate his
kills,but he never buried any of 'em.

159
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,050
All his victims were shot
with a . 45 like frank dunlop.

160
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,720
Hazlit's . 45 was never found.

161
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,920
And hazlit's dead,so copycat.

162
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,840
You ever hear of a copycat killing
30 years after the original?

163
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,720
People are still pretty into this.

164
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,800
Some more than others.

165
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,130
All right,let's get
alibis on tex and squeaky.

166
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,690
They did ask us to look.

167
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,280
Oh,look at this.

168
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,280
Looks like hazlit had a bunch
of kids with different women.

169
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:23,900
They woulda ended up in social
services after the arrests.

170
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,200
Some of them may still be around.

171
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,620
Wanna see if any of them
went into the family business?

172
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,370
Eight wives,43 children.

173
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,250
Eight wives all at the same time?

174
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,790
That's like 1,000 pounds of wife in
the house. No wonder hazlit was crazy.

175
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,200
I always thought I'd have a lot of kids.

176
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,920
House full of noise. Chaos.

177
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,020
What about you,detective reese?

178
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,000
I don't think it's a good
idea for me to have children.

179
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,930
Why is that?

180
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,300
Because it wouldn't be.

181
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,880
- Me? I'd like two kids.
- Well,good luck with that.

182
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,210
according to these files
we got from social services,

183
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,910
the kids that were taken from hazlit in
1972 were given their mother's last name.

184
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,600
Makes sense. You wouldn't want "hazlit"
on the back of your hockey jersey.

185
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,070
One of those mother's names was garber.

186
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,790
Her son is flint garber ... hazlit.

187
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,030
Let me guess. Another
mother's last name was paxton?

188
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,300
Her daughter's name was
maude paxton ... hazlit.

189
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,030
Johnny hazlit had two kids living
a chip shot from the murder?

190
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,920
I guess you figured
out who our pappy was.

191
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,860
- Maude,where's flint?
- He's inside.

192
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,540
He's got a gun,but it isn't
loaded,so don't shoot him.

193
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,570
Don't you steal my stuff.

194
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,860
We're not here for your stuff,flint.

195
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,200
We're here for you.

196
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,730
The last time we were here,
you didn't say you were hazlits.

197
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,180
You didn't ask if we were
hazlits. Last time you were here.

198
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,630
It's not the kind of thing we advertise.

199
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,940
Word gets out,townsfolk
start lighting the torches.

200
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,290
Frank dunlop know who you were?

201
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,830
Does frank know we grew up
surrounded by death covered in blood?

202
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,660
No,we don't speak about it.

203
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,550
Flint?

204
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,070
Frank was the uh...

205
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,940
was the kind of guy you
could talk to. He was uh...

206
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,680
he was a real good listener.

207
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,420
Flint!

208
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:58,380
Frank is the only one I ever
talked to about us being h-- us.

209
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,550
There are three bedrooms
being used in this house.

210
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,530
If one of them is yours,maude,and
the other one is flint's,

211
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,580
then who sleeps in the other bedroom?

212
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,410
Clifton. My son.

213
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,450
not my son. Clifton is my nephew.

214
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,900
Where's clifton today?

215
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,640
He hasn't been around since monday.

216
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:23,270
You know where we can find him?

217
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,750
If frank is the only person you
ever talked to about it... flint?

218
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,640
Does your son know he's a hazlit?

219
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,160
He'd use it against
me. The way I grew up.

220
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,600
You're not gonna tell
clifton about this,are you?

221
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,440
Well,now we have three hazlits living
just a chip shot away from frank's murder.

222
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,490
detectives. Got a gun here.

223
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,690
Got another one over here.
And a knife; dried blood on it.

224
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,520
that's just junk I
collected over the years.

225
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:52,580
I mean,I couldn'ta killed
frank. I never leave this house.

226
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,840
We were watching tv that night.

227
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,380
okay. Well,we're just gonna
ask you to come along with us.

228
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,050
Run some tests on those weapons.

229
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,190
If you'd like to just stand up for
us,please,and put your hands behind your backs.

230
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,240
Is that really necessary?

231
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,510
Oh,alrighty.

232
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,030
Once I saw pappy kill a
man while he was handcuffed.

233
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,970
Strangled him with the chain.

234
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:19,120
Said it was proof of the
master-slave relationship.

235
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:28,420
A victim was found shot at a foreclosed
house,that's all I can tell you.

236
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,530
Johnny hazlit? Didn't
he play for the dodgers?

237
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,330
Oh,must be a different
one. Never heard of him.

238
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,950
The press are all over us.

239
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,010
They know about the victim
being buried up to his neck?

240
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,810
Only us and the killer have that
detail. you giving interviews?

241
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,490
- No,but-- - but
what,my good detectives?

242
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,290
Lamomam. Lamomam.

243
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,360
- Lamomam?
- Lamomam. You drive.

244
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,800
clifton garber?

245
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,010
You wanna step away from the car?

246
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,210
It's my car. Why would I
wanna step away from it?

247
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,060
'Cause she asked you to.

248
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,920
You know frank dunlop?

249
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,490
Frankie meals on wheels? Why?

250
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,700
Because your father and aunt have just
been arrested in connection with his murder.

251
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,320
My father never leaves the house.

252
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,830
And my aunt,she's-- she's
practically mrs. Butterworth.

253
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,250
Wait,someone-- someone
killed frankie dunlop?

254
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,520
Do you always keep your
car so clean,clifton?

255
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,550
Shampooing the trunk?

256
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,370
Yeah,it took every penny that I have.

257
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,890
So I like to take care of it.

258
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,970
Took every penny you have?

259
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,110
Is that why you're living at home?

260
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,790
No,it's how every
23-year-old wants to roll.

261
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,310
How come you think that my
dad and aunt are involved?

262
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,270
We found guns at the house.

263
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,610
Yeah. My dad's got a lot of junk.

264
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,510
But like I said,he doesn't go out.

265
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,010
You mind if we take a sample
from this carpet back there?

266
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,580
Yeah,I do. A lot.

267
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,970
Might depreciate the value.

268
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,580
Your dad seemed to like frank.

269
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,320
Guess so.

270
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,580
the way he talked about him,guess
he thought of frank kind of as a son.

271
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,250
But you're his son,so...

272
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,960
where you been these last few days?

273
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,090
With my girlfriend.

274
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,390
You wanna give us her name?

275
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,930
Not really.

276
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,720
Reese,you wanna tell clifton about
the family plan we have at lockup?

277
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,070
You're dating clifton garber?

278
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,130
For about a year.

279
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,750
why didn't you tell us
last time we were here?

280
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,230
Something you're
protecting clifton from?

281
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,960
He and frank didn't get along.

282
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,160
Frank was very sweet,and clifton didn't
believe anybody could be that sweet.

283
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,070
It made clifton so mad.

284
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,230
Mindy,did clifton ever mention
his father? Or his aunt?

285
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,370
where's your partner squeaky,tex?

286
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,460
- At an auction.
- You talk to the press?

287
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,660
The press? About the hazlit
killing? Nuh-uh. No,sir.

288
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:01,810
If you did,you'd be getting
in the way of my investigation.

289
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,280
You know,not everyone
thinks he's innocent.

290
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,880
- Excuse me?
- Your old partner. Check the websites.

291
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:11,690
A lot of people out there still
think he killed that family.

292
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,660
About a year ago,clifton came in to
sign his dad and aunt up for the program.

293
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,840
His dad's some kind of a
shut-in,and his aunt forgets things.

294
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,730
Like to shop and stuff.

295
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,090
So clifton arranged for meals
to be delivered to the house.

296
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,770
To make sure that they had food.

297
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,520
In case he was working and
didn't get home to feed them.

298
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:35,820
I think that clifton hated frank because
clifton's afraid of his own sweetness.

299
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,100
And clifton was with you?

300
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,360
And you're not afraid of his sweetness?

301
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,270
No,not at all. Why should I be?

302
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,440
We have a few empty display cases in
there for your old partner if it turns out,

303
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,740
you know,he did do that family.

304
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:56,000
We're gonna go now,tex.
You remember what I said.

305
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,390
Hey,anything of crews's
you'd be willing to sell me?

306
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,500
Uh,some shoes? Or a used
coffee cup? Just in case?

307
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,390
********

308
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,820
You gonna talk to rayborn?

309
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,990
Said he's got something to tell me.

310
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,060
That fbi agent said you go after
rayborn,you go back to jail.

311
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,120
Well,that's just the way they talk.

312
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,470
I couldn't go back to jail.

313
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,380
No one is going back to jail,ted.

314
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,370
It's a wedding invitation.

315
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,960
To your father's wedding.

316
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,910
Ted.

317
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,660
Putting aside the fact that you say you're in love
with the woman who is going to marry my father,

318
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,440
I have not said a word
to my dad in 12 years.

319
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:13,210
I'm not going to his wedding.
Why would you wanna go?

320
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,660
I do love her,charlie.

321
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:22,460
Ted,she is marrying my father.

322
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:28,710
You know? It might be easier to think of who
set me up for those murders than you and...

323
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,940
you know how small a cancer cell is?

324
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,710
Very small?

325
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,970
Think about all the ass you've
kicked in your life,and in the end,

326
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,640
I'm gonna get cored out like an apple by
something I can't even take a swing at.

327
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,800
You know,I think you're
the reason I went to jail.

328
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,850
Because you saw a photo.

329
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,460
You know,I think you're the
reason my friends were murdered.

330
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,750
So I guess I'm not exactly sure
why you think I care you're dying.

331
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,770
Well,for one thing,you
might save yourself a bullet,

332
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:05,270
and for another,when I'm dead,I'm dead.

333
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,180
I know your secret,detective.

334
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,310
Well,that's good to hear. 'Cause as
it turns out,I don't know my secret.

335
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,700
All those words help keep
the dark thoughts away?

336
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,540
Your secret is you want to come
out of the dark,but you can'T.

337
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,340
You want to leave behind
the blood,but you can'T.

338
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:27,780
You want to let go of
revenge,but you can'T.

339
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,040
How do you know that?

340
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:32,140
I know that because I know that.

341
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:38,430
See? I also have words,detective.

342
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,990
And I also have photos.

343
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,170
You know this guy?

344
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,990
Can't place him.

345
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,360
Yeah,okay.

346
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:55,130
You see that look on his
face,that smug fed smile.

347
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,230
He works for the fbi.
Maybe you knew that.

348
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,920
I thought you said you had photos.

349
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,240
Well,special agent
bodner,here,works for the fbi.

350
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,720
He does a little moonlighting,though.

351
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,830
He works for someone else too.

352
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,890
Yeah? Who's that?

353
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:19,690
Roman nabokov. I know you know him.

354
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,610
I know you wanted him.

355
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,960
And I know that bodner took him away.

356
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,920
Bodner works for roman.

357
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,570
Was the dunlop killing a hazlit copycat?

358
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,190
We're pursuing all leads.

359
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,630
Wow,looks like the leak got bigger.

360
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,210
Bet their business is booming.

361
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,750
At this point in time,I would ask for your
patience and allow us to do our job. Thank you.

362
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,610
You fail to mention the victim
was found buried up to his neck,

363
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,300
or that there were flowers
found scattered around the body,

364
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,330
just like johnny hazlit used to do it.

365
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,240
Yes,I failed to mention that.

366
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:03,130
You failed to mention that the victim was found
near the home of flint garber,1818 vista vierra.

367
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,530
Yeah,failed to mention that. Also
failed to mention something else.

368
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,480
- What's that?
- You're under arrest.

369
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,320
Yeah,okay.One more thing:

370
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,350
Flint garber and maude paxton
were the children of johnny hazlit.

371
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,340
There's a grandson too,clifton.

372
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,350
A house full of hazlits around
the block from the murder.

373
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,540
Come on,that's enough.

374
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,680
that frank dunlop's body
was buried up to the neck

375
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,720
is a detail that didn't go to the press.

376
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,680
We keep certain facts to ourselves.

377
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,880
Then the only people who know those
facts are us cops,or the killer.

378
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:39,620
Come on,lapd leaks like a sieve.

379
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,880
Where do you think we get
most of our information from?

380
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,940
Maybe it was a tribute murder.

381
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,180
or a copycat. There's a difference.

382
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,880
It's subtle,but it's there.

383
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,170
You should teach a class.

384
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:55,650
Hey,maybe we could get your
partner to give a guest lecture.

385
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,940
What do you
think,squeaky,should we do it?

386
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,880
Actually,I do know the difference
between copycat and tribute.

387
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,830
Detail I picked up at lamomam.

388
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,640
Let me see if I get this right.

389
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,750
Hazlit left flowers by his kills.

390
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,390
Now,if frank dunlop's body
had had flowers surrounding it,

391
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,640
- that woulda been a copycat,yes?
- Yes.

392
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:20,130
But frank dunlop's body
the way it was found?

393
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,780
It was a flower that someone left
for hazlit,and that's a tribute.

394
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,200
Yes,detective. That's a tribute.

395
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:31,910
okay,hazlit didn't like people
who lied or broke promises to him.

396
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,070
Frank dunlop ever break
any promises to you?

397
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,070
We didn't know frank dunlop.

398
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,670
We just find hazlit fascinating.

399
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,820
Like the rest of the
world. Like you two.

400
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,920
Well,we'll be less fascinated
once we find frank dunlop's killer.

401
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,320
Maybe you won't be able to.

402
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,290
Maybe you'll always
find him fascinating.

403
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,060
Oh,like a song you can't
get out of your head?

404
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,460
Yeah,man. Like that.

405
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,920
do you have alibis for the
night frank dunlop was killed?

406
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:58,390
At an auction for
hillside strangler items.

407
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,740
We were both there.

408
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,670
Are we suspects now?

409
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,930
Do you wanna be?

410
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,430
That'll be good for ticket sales.

411
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,910
We'll check out your alibi.

412
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,540
If it all pans out,you get to go home.

413
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,200
Take your time.

414
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,350
auction house employees saw
squeaky and tex that night.

415
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:23,930
But it was,in their words,"a mob scene
for all that hillside strangler swag."

416
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,790
I'm not sure I understand a world
where that stuff sells at auctions.

417
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,170
Well,they got what
they wanted. Publicity.

418
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,540
- Bobby!
- On it!

419
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,830
Coming through! Move it! Move!

420
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:55,670
I always wanted to know
what a hazlit tasted like.

421
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,280
Meet clifton hazlit,johnny
hazlit's grandson.

422
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:07,830
Come on. Make a lane!
Make a lane! Make a lane!

423
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,480
I look just like hazlit,don't I?

424
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:26,610
All my life,I thought there
was something wrong with me.

425
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,180
Turns out there is.

426
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,460
The man you hit isn't
gonna press charges.

427
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,780
They exposed me,what happens to them?

428
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,500
I shoulda done what my
grandfather would've.

429
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,770
What's that?

430
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,740
Made them pay in blood.

431
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,900
Clifton? You're no different than
you were before you found out.

432
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,280
Oh,I'm different. You heard her.

433
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,860
Now I'm johnny hazlit's grandson.

434
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:57,340
all right,well,you know,we
can let you out the back.

435
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,140
Why the back?

436
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:01,420
Because those photographers,they're
waiting for you out front.

437
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,220
- hello?
- Who is this?

438
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,910
This is charles crews. Who is this?

439
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,240
I was looking for olivia.

440
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,560
I thought I dialed her cell phone.

441
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,380
You dialed the house.

442
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,060
She's out trying on her wedding
dress for the 10,000th time.

443
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,530
You want me to leave
her a message for you?

444
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:35,850
Uh,tell her... somebody called.

445
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,940
Somebody?What
the--

446
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,940
Somebody? Somebody called?

447
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,720
Oh,great.

448
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,950
Red light? Did I run it?

449
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,260
license and registration.

450
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,500
You know why we pulled
you over,mr. Earley?

451
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,500
I blew through that light.

452
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:19,670
I'm gonna run these.

453
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,440
Gun!

454
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,410
Show me your hands!

455
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,680
Out of the car.

456
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,350
On your knees.

457
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,960
I'm sorry,I have a friend on the force.

458
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:50,160
On your knees.

459
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,630
Found this next to the gun.

460
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,800
That is not mine. Not the
gun,not whatever's in that baggie.

461
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,820
Oh,guys. Guys,please.
I'm--I'm on parole.

462
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,300
Maude paxton-hazlit and flint
garber-hazlit alibi each other.

463
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,790
So they both did it,or
they both didn't do it?

464
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,650
What about the guns
found out at the house?

465
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,870
None of them match the
bullets found in frank dunlop.

466
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,360
We're running 'em down to see if
they match up to any other crimes.

467
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,700
Squeaky and tex?

468
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,830
They alibi each other too.

469
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,260
So they both did it or
they both didn't do it.

470
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,120
What about the grandson,young clifton?

471
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,830
He was with his girlfriend.

472
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,720
Or maybe not.

473
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,990
mindy! Is it true you're in a
relationship with clifton garber?

474
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,200
That is not true.

475
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,230
Didn't you tell the police you were in a
relationship with johnny hazlit's grandson?

476
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,320
No.

477
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,840
Your father?

478
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,850
He get you to say what
you did to those reporters?

479
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,670
I'm sorry if I wasted your time.

480
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,970
You're withdrawing your statement?

481
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,400
A man was killed,mindy. A man you knew.

482
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,860
What did you call him? A saint?

483
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,590
Clifton asked me to
cover for him and I did.

484
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,210
We weren't having a relationship.

485
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,030
I only knew him from the food bank.

486
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,040
I wasn't having a relationship
with clifton garber.

487
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,350
It was a mistake and I'm sorry.

488
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,800
Wow,what do you think,detective crews?

489
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,430
I think that's a nice speech.

490
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:45,170
Did you write it,or did your dad?

491
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,390
I have to go now.

492
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,130
You like clifton?

493
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,450
'Cause he's not from your world.

494
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,430
He's not your dad over there.

495
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,490
He drives for people like your dad.

496
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:04,330
Mindy,are you recanting because
you really weren't with clifton?

497
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:08,740
Or is it because it turns out
the man you were with is a hazlit?

498
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,110
I wasn't with clifton.

499
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,190
You're looking at
obstruction of justice.

500
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,460
Do you understand that?

501
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,030
My father said his lawyers will
call you about that. I have to go.

502
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,570
- Do you believe her?
- Nope.

503
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:32,500
Her dad finds out his daughter is linked to
a hazlit,and clifton garber loses his alibi.

504
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,070
Yeah.

505
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,510
It's a weird thing to
hold against somebody.

506
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,650
- What?
- Their blood.

507
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:50,390
Yep. We'll be right there.

508
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,160
Lamomam,shots fired.

510
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,880
Squeaky?

511
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,250
Is he dead,is tex dead?

512
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:43,010
Did you see who it was?

513
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:47,900
Yeah. I did. He was here.

514
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,850
Who was here?

515
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:54,140
Hazlit. It was johnny hazlit.

516
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,950
I heard the gun and I turned.

517
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,610
Tex was on the ground.

518
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,510
And then I saw him.

519
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:09,000
You saw johnny hazlit with the gun?

520
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,320
I saw the gun.

521
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,700
It looked bigger in his
hands,bu--but it was his hand.

522
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,170
It was johnny hazlit.

523
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,710
He shot tex,and then he shot me,and
then he dropped the gun and ran.

524
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,060
Squeaky,sometimes when you see a
gun like that,that's all you see.

525
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,690
It confuses everything else.

526
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,350
I wasn't confused. It was johnny.

527
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,110
He was here. I saw him.

528
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,600
But he ran.

529
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,800
Well,we know johnny hazlit didn't do it.

530
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,570
'Cause he's dead?

531
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,950
Let's get some gunshot residue
tests done on squeaky and tex uhry.

532
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,310
Yeah. Only one of them is
dead,but both of them are crazy.

533
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,640
Maybe she did see johnny hazlit.

534
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,710
That would be the crazy part.

535
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:06,000
What if you found out there was something
in your blood that you didn't know was there?

536
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,890
the guy I hit? That museum freak.

537
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,590
that's right. The museum
that exposed you as a hazlit.

538
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,690
You think I killed that greeb.

539
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,170
Like you said,it's what
your grandfather woulda done.

540
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,310
You have good reason.

541
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:27,390
Yeah? I also have an alibi.

542
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,830
I been here all night.

543
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,050
And so have they.

544
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:35,110
And they're not gonna recant like mindy.

545
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,210
Yeah! All right.

546
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,550
Nope,they like me for who I am.

547
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,510
Yeah. Everywhere I go,they go.

548
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,690
Wanna take a picture with me?

549
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:57,010
No? Okay.

550
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:02,320
You live in this limo 'cause
you don't wanna go home.

551
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:06,080
I'd rather never step foot
back in that house again.

552
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:09,530
But you can't afford anywhere else.

553
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,910
- That's right.
- Because this limo took all your cash.

554
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:18,640
Which is why you moved
home in the first place.

555
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:23,020
Yeah. Limo took all my cash.

556
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,930
So if you don't have any money,who
pays the mortgage on that house?

557
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,380
Dad,I guess.

558
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:32,710
With what? Did flint ever have a job?

559
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:36,970
Dad never worked a day in his life.

560
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,440
Gunshot residue test on squeaky
and tex came back negative.

561
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:49,530
Thanks,bobby.

562
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,160
You don't work. We checked.

563
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,870
You don't collect social security.

564
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,090
Would've had to use
your real name for that?

565
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,220
So how do you pay the mortgage,flint?

566
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,180
And the utilities?

567
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,740
You sell some of your stuff?

568
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,470
It's valuable stuff. It's my legacy.

569
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,080
It all belonged to johnny hazlit.

570
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:08,280
- That's right.
- Who bought it?

571
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:10,210
Collectors overseas.

572
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,080
Do you know squeaky and tex uhry?

573
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,640
They made me a couple of lowball offers.

574
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,500
Didn't have any cash.

575
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,630
They couldn't match
those foreign offers.

576
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,690
Did frank know the uhrys?

577
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,670
I told him not to sell to them.

578
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,430
Go for that foreign money.

579
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,160
Why would frank sell
anything? It's all your stuff.

580
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,390
Mindy said frank told her he found
a way to raise a lot of money.

581
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,350
Flint,did you give anything to frank?

582
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,930
All of it.

583
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,060
So he could sell it?

584
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:46,400
Frank woulda just used it for charity.

585
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:51,110
Frank listened to me.

586
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,160
And he said that he could do
good things with that money.

587
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,680
And that...

588
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:05,720
and that would make you good.

589
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:13,190
But I told him to stick
with the foreign buyers.

590
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,340
Detectives.

591
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,330
That's the gun found at the museum.

592
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,780
Yeah,the one that shot squeaky and tex.

593
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,100
Ballistics confirmed that.

594
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:30,570
And that gun there matches the
slugs pulled from frank dunlop.

595
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,450
What?

596
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,360
We pulled some prints off
the grip. We got a match.

597
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,580
Guess who.

598
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,850
Johnny hazlit?

599
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:42,010
But he's been dead for over 30 years.

600
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:46,110
Provenance.

601
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,780
<i>HAZLIT'S BACK!!</i>

602
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,220
We're sorry for your loss.

603
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,460
Tex would've wanted this.

604
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,930
Why'd you kill frank dunlop?

605
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,300
I didn't kill frank dunlop.

606
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:22,130
Frank was told not to sell to you.

607
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:26,440
All that sweet hazlit swag going
overseas where they get a better price.

608
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,830
Is that why you killed him?

609
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,580
then making him look like this?

610
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,030
That's just good for business.

611
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,390
It really paid off.

612
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,120
Tex and i were at that auction.

613
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,870
You know,that auction was so
crowded,you and tex could've left,

614
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,170
and no one would've even noticed.

615
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,830
That's what we call a "soft alibi."

616
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,630
Why'd you kill tex,squeaky?

617
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,400
I didn't kill tex.

618
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:51,470
He get nervous about that soft alibi?

619
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,800
I don't know who killed frank dunlop.

620
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,460
But johnny hazlit killed tex.

621
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,730
He was here,I saw him.

622
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,460
Johnny hazlit is dead.

623
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,170
It says so right on that exhibit.

624
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,590
The person who owned hazlit's
gun,that's who killed tex.

625
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:06,570
Tracked the money
order of yours,squeaky.

626
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,550
$15,000 last month to japan.

627
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,280
You know,that's a lot of
money to spend on a gun.

628
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,830
But I guess you have to
spend money to make money.

629
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,020
checked your bank. That was
every last penny you had.

630
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:20,850
You owned that gun. Why
didn't you exhibit it?

631
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,970
'Cause you were using it.

632
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,800
- What's that word,crews?
- Provenance.

633
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,520
That was hazlit. He was here,I saw him!

634
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:36,120
That gun has his prints!

635
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,610
Guess she's working on
her insanity defense.

636
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,750
Maybe it was hazlit back from the dead.

637
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,390
Or maybe squeaky and
tex were wearing gloves.

638
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,880
If those gloves were part of the
murder,you'd have to put 'em on display.

639
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:08,220
- Because she knew they were real.
- crews?

640
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:13,960
- charlie!
- Let's get outta here.

641
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,660
Yeah. Let's get outta here.

642
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,750
You run a lean operation here.

643
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,690
Plenty of fresh produce,though,foundation
of any good meal.

644
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,370
Where's rachel? Your niece?

645
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,930
She's not my niece.

646
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,700
I know who that girl is,detective.

647
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:52,600
She went out. Some musician-type
called on her. Not my type.

648
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:55,890
I wouldn't let him near my daughters.

649
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,180
- Where's ted?
- Ted.

650
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,820
We'll get to that in a moment.

651
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,930
What did mickey rayborn say to you?

652
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,290
That's between me and him.

653
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,620
I thought that'd be your answer.

654
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:10,170
Detective,what did I tell you would
happen if you went after rayborn?

655
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,660
I told you you'd go back to jail.

656
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,530
But I'm not in jail.

657
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,740
You'll get to ted in a moment?

658
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,790
I'd like that moment to be now.

659
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:29,250
We did some thinking back at our
thinking room,and on reflection,

660
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:33,330
threatening you with jail might
not be that much of a threat.

661
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,950
You wanna try this?

662
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,310
- I'm good.
- You sure?

663
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,640
I got it right where I want it.

664
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,990
Where's ted?

665
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,830
Probably still out at county.

666
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,610
But I'd say he'd be at
supermax by noon tomorrow.

667
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,950
You can't drive around
with a gun and coke.

668
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,140
You know ted can't hack another stretch.

669
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,830
You went after rayborn,and you got in.

670
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:09,170
Now you gonna stay in
and do what we tell you.

671
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,360
You make sure that stay at a simmer,

672
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,680
and run a spoon through
it every once in a while.
