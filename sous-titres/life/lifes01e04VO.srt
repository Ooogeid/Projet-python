2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:05,760
Every day I spend above ground...

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,300
is a reason to celebrate.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,620
The money and the badge are the settlement.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,050
Ames is retired LAPD.

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,240
You go near his house,you go
near him,and he'll shoot you.

00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:23,150
{\a6}Detective Carl Ames (retired)
Lead Detective Crews murder case

8
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,100
Here's what's left of Tom Seybolt.

9
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,040
Dead couple had two kids.

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,550
I wanna know where she is.

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,760
She's gone.

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,830
Her family died, and she got a new one.

13
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,510
And don't you dare try to find her.

14
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,290
<i>What they saw</i>

15
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,760
Hello ?

16
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,290
Charlie ?

17
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,020
The door was open.

18
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,320
Cupcakes ?

19
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,590
You want one ?

20
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,130
You should lock your door.

21
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:09,530
I called twice.

22
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,360
Phone,pool,Tina,Gina...

23
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,660
I did what you asked.

24
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,440
The children's service
records on Rachel Seybolt.

25
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,000
You had them unsealed ?

26
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,640
What do you want with Rachel Seybolt?

27
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,920
She used to call me her uncle.

28
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,830
That was a long time ago.

29
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,870
I think...

30
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,160
Seeing what she went
through,she might need some help.

31
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,620
I think seeing what I went through,I
might be in a position to do that.

32
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,000
I had Rachel Seybolt's records unsealed.

33
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,430
The file was gone.

34
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,180
The jacket was empty.

35
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,660
It's not some big conspiracy, Charlie.

36
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,930
It's social services.

37
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,830
I'm sure the records...

38
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,160
Fell behind a filing cabinet.

39
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,640
Cupcakes ?

40
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,780
You think they're not good for me ?

41
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,510
I don't think...

42
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,540
You should be living on them.

43
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,810
I didn't think i'd be living at all.

44
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,960
I know, Charlie.

45
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,350
I know.

46
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,180
Look, I heard the scream, and
then I called security.

47
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,320
By the time the idiot guard
showed up, it was too late.

48
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,190
Stephanie, Honey,these are the
police, not the security company.

49
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,510
Don't edit me, Drew. Just back off.

50
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,310
All right, clear those
people from the front.

51
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,280
We don't need a mob out there.

52
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,440
And I want their statements asap.

53
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,200
Detective Crews called in
and said he was already here.

54
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:06,760
Find him.

55
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,970
Copy that.

56
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:08,830
What do we got ?

57
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,490
Victim, male, gunshot, master bedroom.

58
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,150
Can't find the gun.

59
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,100
Signs of a break-in.

60
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,290
The back door's busted.

61
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,420
Yeah, so the alarm went off.

62
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,260
You know how many false alarms I get ?

63
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,070
Check his gun.

64
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,070
It ain't real.

65
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,900
Company's afraid they'll get
sued if I shoot anybody...

66
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,210
Not that I ever get to.

67
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,710
All right,where are we ?

68
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,490
Anyone seen Detective Crews ?

69
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,230
You got a problem with
gay mariage,officer ?

70
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,710
I embrace our city's
rich diversity, detective,

71
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,820
like the department
policy says I should.

72
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,430
Mm-hmm, you find his ring ?

73
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,950
Oh,god!

74
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,340
LAPD. Show me your hands !

75
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,340
Hey!

76
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,830
Do you not see the gun ?

77
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,790
What do you got up there, a costco ?

78
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,860
Cut it out.

79
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,690
Now, get down here, or
I'm comin' up after you.

80
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,470
Oh, jeez.

81
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,920
I just bought this suit.

82
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,880
This is Len Sand's partner, James
Muthupalanianppanwikma something.

83
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,090
Hi. James.

84
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,160
Let me help you up.

85
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,150
I'm Detective Reese.

86
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,030
How could anyone kill Lenny?

87
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,360
Everybody loved Lenny.

88
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,790
Did Mr. Sand wear a wedding ring?

89
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,200
Both did, always.

90
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,100
We had them made special.

91
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,620
We found your partner.

92
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,040
Get up.

93
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,130
You do not throw things at the LAPD.

94
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,570
You're lucky i'm enlightened.

95
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,850
Yeah, well, I'm not as
enlightened as my partner.

96
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,940
He was hiding down here.

97
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,860
I identified myself.

98
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,500
He threw a toaster at me.

99
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,530
Throwing toasters at the LAPD is bad.

100
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,110
Makes you look like you're
guilty of something. Are you ?

101
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,660
You got anything in your
pockets that'll stick me ?

102
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,200
Look at this.

103
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,030
You got a dead man's wedding ring
in your pocket. You know that?

104
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,750
You're under arrest for
the murder of Len Sand.

105
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,160
Take him away.

106
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,820
You just called me your partner.

107
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,120
When ?

108
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,440
Just now.

109
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,130
No,I didn't.

110
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,210
Yeah,you did.

111
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,050
No. I never said that.

112
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,450
You heard her, didn't you ?

116
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,030
You meant to rob, not hurt anybody, right?

117
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,620
It was an accident.

118
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,600
Where's the gun, by the way ?

119
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,150
You've been drinking ?

120
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,620
Smells like it.

121
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,940
So you were drunk.

122
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,160
You didn't know what you were doing.

123
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,090
All right, I am trying to help you.

124
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:30,220
Anyone dies during a burglary, it's
first-degree murder, special circumstances.

125
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,220
You're looking at the gurney.

126
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,600
Baby powder!

127
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,160
For the poison ivy you got.

128
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,460
You ran through it on the hill.

129
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,480
I know to avoid it, but
you must have not seen it.

130
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,670
I'd really like to get outta here.

131
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,530
I don't like it inside so much.

132
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,150
Can't breathe in here ?

133
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,730
Yeah,that's right. How'd you know ?

134
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,780
Why are you shouting ?

135
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,920
Am I ?

136
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,440
It's been so long since I
talked to anybody,and my voice...

137
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,330
Sounds weird ?

138
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,290
Yeah,that's right.

139
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,860
Like someone else
whispering in your ear ?

140
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,570
How did you know ?

141
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,620
What's your name ?

142
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,340
Holt Easley, and I'm 61 years old.

143
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,410
You ever been arrested ?

144
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,270
Not for nothin' like murder.

145
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,100
I don't think I ever
even picked up a felony.

146
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,130
All right,why were you in the backyard ?

147
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,270
I live there.

148
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,690
It's better than shelters.

149
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,760
I never been in the house,though.

150
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,930
How come you had the
victim's ring in your pocket ?

151
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,190
I found it.

152
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,930
I did,I swear.

153
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,520
Swear to god !

154
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,120
What were you trying to get away from ?

155
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,570
If I say...

156
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,610
Can I go ?

157
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,390
No.

158
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,330
Can I get a drink?

159
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,560
No!

160
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,210
But if you confess,we won't
charge you with murder one...

161
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,560
or for assaulting Detective Crews.

162
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,620
Or for stealing Detective Reese's pen.

163
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,480
I seen that guy who
lives with Sands kill him.

164
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,770
James.

165
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,550
I seen him shoot him in the head.

166
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,330
Then I seen him go out and
throw that ring in the hills.

167
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,680
I found it.

168
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,800
I was gonna trade it for booze.

169
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,830
Here.

170
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,140
Take it.

171
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,930
Anything that goes
down his pants, you keep.

172
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,390
So what do you think ?

173
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,580
Well... I think he's lying.

174
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,110
I know he's a drunk and a thief.

175
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:28,290
Or a nonconformist, a western
archetype, cowboy on the range.

176
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,580
You actually believe the crap you say ?

177
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,870
It's not important what I believe.

178
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,070
It's important what he believes.

179
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,010
You give a flower sun, it opens up.

180
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,370
You give a man respect, same thing.

181
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,110
You think you're workin' him.

182
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,090
He's working you.

183
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,890
Drunks are great at telling
you what you wanna hear.

184
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,350
Now you think he's innocent.

185
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,100
How long did you work on
the charlie Crews case?

186
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,440
Four years.

187
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,600
{\a6}Constance Griffiths
Attorney for Charlie Crews

188
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,380
That's a tremendous commitment.

189
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,370
Most things worthwhile are.

190
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,050
Now that Charlie Crews is free,

191
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,320
do you need someone else to save ?

192
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,980
It's not about what I need.

193
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,450
Crews, isn't it ?

194
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,460
Oh... Hey, uh...

195
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,130
I'm Neil Cudahy.

196
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,220
You... You're the
reason i'm sittin' here.

197
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,290
Is that right ?

198
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,260
Yeah,when I saw on tv that Constance
Griffiths got you out,I said...

199
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,430
That girl's gotta be my lawyer.

200
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,780
Is that right ?

201
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,420
Charged with assaulting a man
I don't even know,you know?

202
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,960
Can you believe that ?

203
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,900
But the sweetest part is
I don't even have to pay.

204
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,920
She's doing me pro bono.

205
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,800
Did she do you pro bono ?

206
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,450
Charlie ?

207
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,320
What are you doing here ?

208
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,340
We have an appointment.

209
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,750
Yes, we do, Charlie.

210
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,660
Later today.

211
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,930
I can't really figure out this calendar.

212
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,470
What's with that Cudahy guy ?

213
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,410
He's a client.

214
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,920
I wanna talk to you about him.

215
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,760
Well, I can't talk to you
about a client. You know that.

216
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,450
What are you doing ?

217
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,010
Come back when your
appointment is scheduled.

218
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,920
Settle down.

219
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,550
What's all my stuff doing here ?

220
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,420
You mean that stuff you stole ?

221
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,420
I never stole a thing in my life.

222
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,490
You stole my pen.

223
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:49,450
Hey, everything I got in this
world, including your pen, I found.

224
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,060
You can't believe what
rich people throw out.

225
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,510
It works.

226
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,340
If I had a place to plug it
in, i'd use the hell outta that.

227
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,020
Got me through the winter.

228
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,660
There was five bucks, a chapstick, and
six rubbers in the pocket.

229
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,180
And I kept 'em just in case.

230
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,840
One time I found nine clay pigs.

231
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,460
Only thing they don't
throw out is alcohol.

232
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,910
Why would James kill Len ?

233
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,240
We talked to their neighbors.

234
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,650
They said James and Len
seemed happy together.

235
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,060
But I can tell you this.

236
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,350
What seems isn't always what is...

237
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,390
Especially with rich people.

238
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,540
Can you prove any of this ?

239
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,690
Did anyone ever see you dumpster dive ?

240
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,070
That security guard
run me off a few times.

241
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,240
Smith.

242
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,950
You can go ask him. I ain't afraid.

243
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,820
Except for the...

244
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:50,850
Confusion over your
pen, I ain't lied once.

245
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,020
Homeless guy.

246
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,530
No, I never saw a homeless
guy living back there.

247
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,890
You're not real
bright, are you, Mr. Smith ?

248
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,670
About average, I guess. Why ?

249
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,680
Is there a reason you ignored the alarm ?

250
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,810
And the call from the
neighbor about a scream ?

251
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,330
I didn't like going by the Sand place.

252
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,270
It made me kinda sick.

253
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,570
'cause they're gay ?

254
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,140
No, 'cause I'm lazy.

255
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,600
Are we done ?

256
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:20,490
Okay, the guard didn't know Easley
was living in the backyard.

257
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,550
Meaning he doesn't back Easley's story.

258
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,100
Maybe the guard's lying.

259
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,300
The coroner found fibers.

260
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,850
It looks like the shooter wore gloves.

261
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,730
The guard Smith wore gloves that night.

262
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,550
We tested him.

263
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,720
There was no gunshot residue.

264
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,240
Easley says he saw James.

265
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,410
Let's see if James says he saw Easley.

266
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,680
Yes, this is my jacket, and
these are all our things.

267
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,730
Were these stolen from your house
the night your husband Len was killed ?

268
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,630
No.

269
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,760
We threw these things away months ago.

270
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,490
Where did you find them ?

271
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:50,430
A concerned citizen
turned them over to us.

272
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,380
With this.

273
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,720
Where's the rest of it ?

274
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,360
Sorry ?

275
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,150
Well,the rest of the
things that were taken ?

276
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,780
It means the world to me
that you found Len's ring,

277
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,160
but you didn't find anything else.

278
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,670
You seem surprised.

279
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,380
I'm not surprised, disappointed.

280
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,910
The things that were stolen were
the things that Len loved best.

281
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,240
A watch, his mother's candlesticks.

282
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,450
They, uh, they left all
the expensive things.

283
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,510
How would they know what
was most important to Len ?

284
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,380
I... I don't know.

285
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,000
But whoever did is knew Len well.

286
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,800
Really well.

287
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,450
So if the neighbors were near
enough to hear a scream...

288
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,300
What else did they hear ?

289
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,820
Len and James were a great couple.

290
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,560
They loved each other so much.

291
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,670
You never heard them fight?

292
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,600
No,that's why I called Smith
right away when I heard the scream.

293
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,760
But it took him forever to get here.

294
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,530
Tell them about your theory, Drew.

295
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,130
It's not a theory, Stephanie.

296
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,360
It's not anything.

297
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,370
I just heard Officer Smith say things...

298
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,560
Terrible things, homophobic things,
particularly about Len and James.

299
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,940
Drew thinks that Smith killed Len.

300
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,100
He thinks it was a hate crime.

301
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,480
I never said that.

302
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,580
Yes, you did, all right?

303
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,350
Don't be a liar.

304
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,480
I mean, you're such a hypocrite.

305
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,940
Oh, hypocrite. My, my.

306
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:13,950
Has somebody been reading?

307
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,220
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.

308
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,210
Well, then don't act like one.

309
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,210
All rich people are crazy.

310
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,660
It's not just you.

311
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,020
I think i'll give you my card.

312
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,060
Okay.

313
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,800
Drew says it's the guard.

314
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,450
Easley says it's James.

315
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,670
Yep... They call themselves neighbors,

316
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,570
but they don't seem very neighborly.

317
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,310
Detective Crews ?

318
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,720
Yes ?

319
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,070
I couldn't talk
before, but my husband Drew...

320
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,050
Killed Len Sand.

321
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,190
I want your promise my
identity won't be revealed.

322
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,770
We'll certainly do all we
can to protect your anonymity.

323
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,310
Why do you think your husband is
the person who killed Len Sand ?

324
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,930
Because, sadly, my husband is...

325
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,920
A homosexual.

326
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,800
He was having an affair with Len Sand.

327
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,120
I think Len wanted to call
it off, so Drew killed him.

328
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,530
You saw this ?

329
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,720
You saw the murder ?

330
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,900
I saw Drew leaving Len's house
that night after I heard the scream.

331
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,500
That's why I called Smith the security
guard, to tell him that I heard the scream.

332
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,240
Because I didn't want Drew
to know that I saw him.

333
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,750
You heard what Drew said.

334
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,020
He's trying to frame Smith for this.

335
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,040
Do you have proof ?

336
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:26,970
I'm his wife.

337
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,230
He hid things from me.

338
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,900
I wouldn't testify against him anyway.

339
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,290
Truth is...

340
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,120
I love him I just can't stand
to live with this anymore.

341
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,950
Look, if we solve this fast, we
won't have to book Easley.

342
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,240
Why do you care ?

343
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,590
Well, I like the guy.

344
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,690
If I was a cowboy, he'd
be my goofy sidekick.

345
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,280
Kinda like how you're mine.

346
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,350
An affair.

347
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,420
Len and Drew Borns
were having an affair.

348
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,560
Are you serious ?

349
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,550
Mrs. Borns seems to think so.

350
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,270
She said that she saw Drew leave
here the night of the shooting.

351
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,920
Did you ever suspect that Drew
and Len would have an affair ?

352
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,040
No.

353
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,930
I an,but they were good friends.

354
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:16,470
I always used to tease len that he
and drew would make a great couple.

355
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,110
I suspected that drew
was closeted,but I...

356
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:21,910
Look,it's...

357
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,530
It's possible.

358
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,990
We don't have enough evidence to take
to a grand jury to charge Drew or James.

359
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,830
We got an eyewitness
who says it was James.

360
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,190
A drunk homeless guy that we
should have booked eight hours ago!

361
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,280
If the grand jury believes
Easley, we can arrest James.

362
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,030
Plus, Easley won't last in jail.

363
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,350
No, if we don't book
him, we're gonna loose him.

364
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,090
We can't babysit him forever, Crews.

365
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,250
Sorry.

366
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,100
I ain't gonna last too
long in county,boss.

367
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,920
Easley, listen, they got a good
medical wing in there, okay ?

368
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,740
Just tell 'em you have Hep C.

369
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,250
But I don't have Hep C.

370
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,190
It'll buy you a few days in the
infirmary while they run tests...

371
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,030
Now you just hang in there.

372
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,820
Oh, I'll hangin there, for sure.

373
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,560
Give me something...

374
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,290
Something that proves
you're telling the truth.

375
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,620
What the hell you think I been doing ?

376
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,840
I can't think straight inside.

377
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,630
I need to breathe.

378
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,730
I can't in here.

379
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,730
The window.

380
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,160
There's a man with a gun.

381
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,490
You see it, Easley ?

382
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,890
Look at it hard.

383
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:27,230
I told you, it's James shooting the gun.

384
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,780
Tell me everything you see.

385
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,150
James is pissed off.

386
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,080
He's got the gun.

387
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,630
What do you want ?

388
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,730
What's he wearing ?

389
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,450
A tie.

390
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,830
And a suit, I guess.

391
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,680
And gloves.

392
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,420
He's got gloves on.

393
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,680
You told him to say that ?

394
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,630
No,I didn't. I swear.

395
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,540
Smith wore gloves.

396
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,490
Gloves like those ?

397
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,240
No,they were different.

398
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,070
Come on, let's go.

399
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,830
The coroner's report backs his story.

400
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,680
He s what happened.

401
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,810
That's how he knows about the gloves.

402
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,940
Or he knows about them
because he's the killer.

403
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:01,920
Look at him.

404
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,920
He look like someone
who shot a guy to death ?

405
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,240
If so, let's book him. If not...

406
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,390
It's time.

407
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,440
Bus leaves in five minutes.

408
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,720
Boss,please,don't make me go !

409
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,680
Hey, nobody's taking you anywhere.

410
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,100
I promise.

411
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,090
All right, all right, all right, all right.

412
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,540
Thanks. Thank you.

413
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,070
He's ready, you know ?

414
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,810
We got him. He, uh...

415
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,300
We'll take him to the
d.a. Now, so thanks a lot.

416
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,680
Come on.

417
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,620
What ?

418
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,820
You never saw a bluff ?

419
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,540
- I'm kinda hungry.
- Tough!

420
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,280
I could eat something.

421
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,100
What did I just say?

422
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,080
Could we get burgers?

423
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:39,920
I could go for a burger.

424
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:40,560
No!

425
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,090
We gotta eat.

426
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:42,920
Tacos?

427
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,670
I could go for tacos.

428
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:46,870
That's it!

429
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:50,380
If either of you says another
thing about food or about anything,

430
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,760
i'm gonna turn this
car right back around,

431
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,860
and I'm taking him back to jail!

432
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,140
What's that smell?

433
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,920
That's humanity,baby.

434
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,290
This is the right time,isn't it?

435
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,810
Yes,but,um,who's your friend?

436
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,190
Easley.

437
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,890
If you're hungry,there's
fruit in the kitchen.

438
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,110
I think he's a witness.

439
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,240
Although there's a chance he's the killer.

440
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,770
Why is he here?

441
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,670
I figured if he's guilty,then
you get a new client.

442
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,640
If he's innocent,you get a new cause.

443
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,930
He's better than Neil Cudahy.

444
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,880
I checked his files.

445
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,030
Neil is not a good guy.

446
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,140
You checked his files?

447
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,920
I need a toilet.

448
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,050
Down the hall and to the right.

449
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,700
Haven't you got a private one?

450
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,960
Easley,be neat.

451
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,870
Neil Cudahy is a client.

452
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,580
You are not allowed to check his files.

453
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:07,960
I'm okay!

454
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,030
Okay,no problem.

455
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:18,160
- You got a.. A real nice setup in there.
- Thank you.

456
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,980
Can you go back in just for one moment?

457
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,920
Because we're not done.

458
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,990
I'd rather not.

459
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,310
It's kinda rank.

460
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,000
What's this stack of mail?

461
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:28,920
That's your bills.

462
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,040
And I really wish you
wouldn't have Ted pay them.

463
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,080
Ted's good with money.

464
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,350
Ted is good at stealing money.

465
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,650
There's this from the alcohol
and tobacco commission.

466
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,760
It's your liquor license from the
bar that you and your partner owned.

467
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:44,220
Since you were acquitted,you're
entitled to have it back,if you want it.

468
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,800
They fired me.

469
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,120
'cause of not answering that alarm call.

470
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:53,200
You know,we never found the stuff that
was stolen the night that Sand was shot.

471
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,030
You didn't happen to see any of it when
you were poking around there, did ya?

472
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:59,490
I never poked around the Sands' place.

473
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,540
I don't like to be near the gays.

474
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,980
'cause you can catch being gay.

475
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,310
There's that,yeah.

476
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,220
Why'd you lie about Easley?

477
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,170
He says you knew that
he was living there.

478
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,640
I knew it looked bad,him living there.

479
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,910
Oh,screw it.

480
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,990
They fired me anyway.

481
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,750
Rich people suck.

482
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,680
A liquor license is hard to get.

483
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,080
That's a valuable asset, Charlie.

484
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,300
Hey,excuse me.

485
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,240
This is myplate.

486
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,760
That's your plate there.

487
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,840
You weren't eating.

488
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,450
Well,because I was talking!

489
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,720
Can I work in your bar,boss?

490
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,360
Look...Okay. You know what? Here.

491
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,010
You eat while the adults talk,okay?

492
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,940
I could run that for you, Charlie.

493
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,020
I would love to run a bar.

494
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,170
The last time I ran a
bar,my partner ended up dead.

495
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,650
Well,what are the odds
of that happening twice?

496
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,590
That lady lawyer says he steals,boss.

497
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,860
I heard her.

498
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,890
All right,again.

499
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,390
Tell me what you saw
that night in detail.

500
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,000
You gotta get me a drink
if you're gonna keep goin'.

501
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,160
Maybe we should let him sleep.

502
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Easley is e only way
we can get to James.

503
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:33,360
First is getting the grand jury to
believe that Easley saw James shoot Sand.

504
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,200
If they do,they'll indict.

505
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,830
If they don't,then we got nothing
else, and James gets away with murder.

506
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,860
I'm getting you something to drink.

507
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:44,690
Wait. We don't want him
hung over in the grand jury.

508
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,680
When was your last hangover?

509
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,580
1974.

510
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,820
He's a functioning alcoholic.

511
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,250
He works better with booze.

512
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,440
Trust me.

513
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,500
They got drew borns at the
station for questioning.

514
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,940
He's there right now,no lawyer.

515
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,930
What do we do with Easley?

516
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,970
This ain't bad.

517
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,740
When I come back,i'm gonna bring
you something to help you sleep.

518
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,610
I'll be waiting.

519
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,160
I'm not a killer.

520
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,060
I run my own hedge fund,for god's sake.

521
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,120
Stephanie and I fit,but I can't
believe she thinks I'm a killer.

522
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,560
Do you believe she thinks you're gay?

523
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,960
Yes,I can believe that.

524
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,200
Really?

525
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,690
Why is that?

526
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,990
She's very aggressive sexually.

527
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,430
I work hard,long hours.

528
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,220
I get tired.

529
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,850
Whenever I don't want to have
sex,she accuses me of being gay.

530
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:43,030
She's intolerant,homophobic,unstable.

531
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,300
I love her.

532
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,120
I'm wealthy enough to take care of her.

533
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,800
But I won't go to prison
for something I didn't do.

534
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,200
Any more questions,call me.

535
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,570
I've got nothing to hide.

536
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,630
But don't you dare
accuse me of anything.

537
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,110
You know,most cases
we get no eyewitnesses.

538
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,040
This case,we get two...

539
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,510
And they both suck.

540
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,370
Stephanie says it was Drew.

541
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,710
Easley says it was James.

542
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,590
Do you really think Easley's lying?

543
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,500
No.

544
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,150
No.

545
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,650
If he were,he would have
jumped on blaming Drew,you know?

546
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,330
Gave him the chance,but
he wouldn't do that.

547
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,760
Oh,my god.

548
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,750
I locked him in.

549
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,260
Is anybody hurt?

550
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,620
Excuse me,is...

551
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,850
What'd you bring me?

552
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,270
I fell asleep smoking.

553
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,510
I'm sorry.

554
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,430
Fire department come and cut me out.

555
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,690
Where'd you get the booze?

556
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,650
I'm gonna be honest with you.

557
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,450
There's a liquor store on the corner.

558
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,140
When the owners...

559
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:05,880
Come out to see what
all the fuss was about,

560
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,600
I went in and...

561
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,990
Took a few things.

562
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,450
Crews,from now on,he's all yours. 24/7.

563
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,200
You wanted him.

564
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,640
You got him.

565
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,910
Sand's will was filed in probate court.

566
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:27,130
It says that James gets all of
Sand's property when he dies.

567
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,840
James had a financial motive.

568
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,300
Did Drew have a financial motive?

569
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,900
No. Drew's rich.

570
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,620
If he killed James,it
wasn't for the money.

571
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:37,830
Who are you?

572
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm Charlie's roommate.

573
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,070
No. I'm Charlie's roommate.

574
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,560
Easley's staying at your house?

575
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,410
Yes,and he's been
touching my stuff,Charlie.

576
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,140
I think he used my toothbrush.

577
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,030
Did not.

578
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,190
Smell my breath.

579
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,830
I ain't even close to minty.

580
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,430
If I used your toothbrush,i'd be minty.

581
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,450
I ain't the kinda guy who
uses another guy's toothbrush.

582
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,180
So how many coffees did
you let him have,Ted?

583
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:57,750
Six.

584
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:00,770
Once we got that machine of
yours going,we really let it ride.

585
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,770
All right,just take him
home,get him cleaned up.

586
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,690
He is going to the grand jury.

587
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,600
We are going to bring
sexy back to the bar scene.

588
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:17,470
Our target demographic is gonna be 18-
to 29-year-olds,at least initially,to create buzz.

589
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,780
Gotta be 21 to drink.

590
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,960
We're gonna serve tapas and sushi.

591
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:28,160
You gotta get the young in for the
dancing,the old will then follow.

592
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,180
I wouldn't drink there.

593
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,070
It's too fancy.

594
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:36,430
Yeah. You are not our
target demographic. Okay?

595
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,680
Our specialties will be
coladas and daiquiris.

596
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,770
Sounds fruity.

597
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:45,390
You know what? Charlie
happens to like fruit.

598
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:48,240
And the markup on fruit drinks is huge.

599
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,150
All right,let's talk names.

600
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,550
One word names are
very hot right now,okay?

601
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,420
"Stir" is good.

602
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,910
Also "Shaken."

603
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,090
Sounds fruity.

604
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,910
You oughta grow more trees outside,boss.

605
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:09,930
Give you privacy.

606
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,760
Nobody'll see when you kill Ted.

607
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,960
Nice suit.

608
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,250
It's Ted's.

609
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,600
It's too clean.

610
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,220
Nothing in the pockets,not even lint.

611
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:26,840
I used to keep a big
rubber band in my pocket.

612
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,670
It lost its snap,dried out.

613
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,390
I really liked that rubber band.

614
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,860
Are you gonna make it?

615
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,700
I don't think so.

616
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,890
Come on,we're gonna be waiting
outside for you here all the time.

617
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,060
You ain't goin' inside?

618
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,140
No,no.

619
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,110
Witnesses in the grand jury
have to be in there alone.

620
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,190
Oh, Crews, he's not gonna make it.

621
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,040
What are we gonna do?

622
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,860
All right.

623
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,260
Witness prep?

624
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,180
If we don't indict now,James is gone.

625
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,950
You want Easley's testimony or not?

626
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,680
I feel better,boss.

627
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,470
Reese.

628
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,290
Okay. Thanks.

629
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,020
What?

630
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,320
What?

631
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,880
Your new friend here said he'd
never been in Sand's house?

632
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,780
Labs came back.

633
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,410
His dna was all over it.

634
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,200
You're not going to the grand jury.

635
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,210
You're going to jail.

636
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,570
You were the lead detective on
the Charlie Crews murder case?

637
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,850
Yeah,I work that case.

638
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,670
Took my 20 right after we closed it.

639
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:51,300
No dna's gonna tell me
we got the wrong guy.

640
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:49,430
{\a6}Detective Carl Ames (retired)
Lead Detective Crews murder case

641
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,030
Crews, Easley's dna is in the house.

642
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,270
How do we explain that?

643
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,750
He's got a nice smile.

644
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,650
Uh... I'm not sure I
know what you mean by that.

645
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,930
Well,for a guy who lives in
the woods,he's got a nice smile.

646
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:29,330
Ted said he used his toothbrush.

647
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,890
You know,I think he was minty.

648
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,980
I don't know what dna is.

649
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,420
How'd I know how it got in the house?

650
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,150
I ain't lying.

651
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,670
Okay,boss,I used Ted's toothbrush
'cause I didn't have one.

652
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,990
And you tracked mud in
and out of our house.

653
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:51,660
You take your shoes off when
you went into Sand's place?

654
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:54,190
Just to use the bathroom now and then.

655
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,710
You know,to get clean.

656
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,520
You should have told us sooner.

657
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,890
I didn't say nothin'
'cause I know it looks bad.

658
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,680
But I never went inside
unless I knew no one was home.

659
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,820
How could you tell?

660
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:06,590
Windows.

661
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,870
They had the most and fewest trees.

662
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:09,600
You're lying.

663
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,880
I'm not lying this time.

664
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:11,950
I swear it!

665
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:16,110
Prove it right now,or I walk outta here,you
go back to D unit and you die there.

666
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,530
What do you want me to say?

667
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,100
I'll say whatever you tell me.

668
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,130
Wait,boss.

669
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,180
Please don't leave me.

670
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,640
I'm not your boss.

671
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,950
I'm not your friend...

672
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,130
And I'm not giving you any more chances.

673
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,970
You're all out.

674
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,410
Okay,okay.

675
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,790
I can prove James Mermerha...

676
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,220
I can't say his name.

677
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,390
He's the one who did it.

678
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,000
But we're gonna need a shovel.

679
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,540
Crews...

680
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:55,670
I'm telling you,he's playin' us.

681
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,010
Because there is nothing
under here that even...

682
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,860
Clay pig.

683
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,710
Okay.

684
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,140
You got that list of things
James said was stolen?

685
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,670
Yeah.

686
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,510
First item.

687
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,150
Four folders of antique coins.

688
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,200
Yep. Got those in here.

689
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,200
Ah? How 'bout sterling silverware?

690
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,820
Yep. Got that too.

691
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,560
Ah,what about letters?

692
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,950
No. No letters.

693
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,480
Love letters.

694
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,430
Signed by...

695
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,830
Drew Borns.

696
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,730
You wanna know what else is in here?

697
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,800
What?

698
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,580
Yes,I wrote those letters.

699
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,720
My fingerprints could well be
on the things in the bag too.

700
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:01,930
Len always showed off those
things when we'd go over to visit.

701
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:05,910
You stole the letters,along with
the other things that Len Sand loved.

702
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:06,930
Why?

703
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,590
They're all addressed to "my Love."

704
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,880
No name.

705
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:14,580
Those are letters that I
gave to my wife Stephanie.

706
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,140
Can you prove that?

707
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:20,880
No,Detective,I don't keep copies of love
letters to my wife I didn't know I needed to.

708
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,970
James and Stephanie put that stuff
there,hoping we'd find it and blame Drew.

709
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,530
They didn't count on Easley
taking it and burying it.

710
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:33,840
But how do we prove it?

711
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,670
The frame worked.

712
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,450
Drew looks guilty.

713
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,190
We know that.

714
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,850
We know James and Stephanie know that.

715
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:38,820
They don't know we know.

716
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:42,810
What they do know is that if we
found the bag,we'd focus on Drew.

717
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,310
So then they know what
to say when we come.

718
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,120
And so?

719
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,420
I'm not hearing a plan.

720
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,680
Well,let's see if they embrace
not knowing what they don't know.

721
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,630
No. No,I didn't get it.

722
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,050
Are you sure?

723
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,640
Okay.

724
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,190
I'll look for it again.

725
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,760
Can I ask why you called me down here?

726
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,160
It's not a big thing.

727
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,920
Would... Would you
just give me one minute?

728
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,000
This isn't something we
could do over the phone?

729
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,330
Maybe I should have 'em
send it down again.

730
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,690
Oh,here it is.

731
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,000
Have a seat,Stephanie.

732
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,830
Do you know how I got that bag?

733
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,550
Why would I know that?

734
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,390
James gave me that bag.

735
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,660
That's what he's out there talking
to Detective Crews about right now.

736
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:47,210
So,James,your neighbor,Stephanie Borns,found
the items that you reported stolen.

737
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,030
She's in there with my
partner giving her statement.

738
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,990
Whe... Um... When did she find them?

739
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,390
She called this morning.

740
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,220
But don't worry.

741
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,720
Your items are all being indexed,and
they will be returned to you...

742
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,180
Plus a few you left out.

743
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,310
Left out?

744
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,210
What... What things?

745
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,300
I got the list here.

746
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,380
You don't know what's in the bag?

747
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,140
No,I told you I don't know.

748
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,460
'cause James said you do.

749
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,550
He told my partner that you
know exactly what's in that bag.

750
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,660
Two "lali-kay" candlesticks.

751
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,510
Am I pronouncing that
right,"la-li-kay"?

752
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,480
Lalique.

753
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,510
That's glass.

754
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,090
Glass,right?

755
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,490
It's french glass.

756
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,220
Weird,her bringing the
bag in here like that.

757
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,700
It's your stuff. You'd think
she'd just call you about it.

758
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,590
I guess people just like to
cooperate with the police.

759
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:38,140
James gave me this bag and
said that you shot Len Sand.

760
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:40,100
That you shot his husband.

761
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:44,270
He's finalizing his official statement
with Detective Crews right now.

762
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,300
You got a first edition book on bondage.

763
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,700
Of human bondage.

764
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,600
"mog-ham"?

765
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,610
Maugham.

766
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,030
French,like the glass?

767
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,930
English,like the language.

768
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:01,180
He says you shot Len Sand
using that gun,Stephanie.

769
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,250
It has your husband's
fingerprints all over it

770
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,640
My husband's prints.

771
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,080
James said you wanted to
set Drew up for that murder,

772
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,180
So you shot Len Sand and left the gun
and these other objects for us to find.

773
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,670
Why would I do that?

774
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,380
I had no motive to kill Len.

775
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,310
I liked him.

776
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:16,780
We couldn't figure out the motive.

777
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,720
You didn't get anything
from Len Sand's death.

778
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,180
That's true.

779
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,160
I didn't.

780
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,070
But you'd get everything
if Drew was blamed for it.

781
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:24,870
Come on, Stephanie.

782
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,700
Drew's rich,you're not.

783
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,130
He controls all the money.

784
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:31,970
Your prenup states that you get everything
if Drew gives you cause for a divorce.

785
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,800
Now, a murder conviction.

786
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,300
Guess what? That's cause.

787
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:36,780
You and James both make out.

788
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,560
You get all of Drew's money,
he gets all of Len Sand's.

789
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,160
But James over there...

790
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,860
got cold feet and brought us this bag.

791
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,750
Okay,let me see. Almost done.

792
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,960
Here we go. One
Patek-Philippe chronograph.

793
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,080
What is that?

794
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,260
A watch.

795
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,650
You should have just put that down here.

796
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,550
I'll fix that for you.

797
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,530
It's okay.

798
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,310
w-
a-t-c-h.

799
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,050
Watch.

800
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:06,180
He says you shot Sand, Stephanie.

801
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:10,240
He gave us this bag and
said that you shot Sand.

802
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,710
You had access to your husband's gun.

803
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,200
It makes sense.

804
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,640
But these are all on the list.

805
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,130
Just one last item here.

806
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,730
We got an Automatic 40 caliber.

807
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,050
That's a gun, James.

808
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,450
Should I write it down that way?

809
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:36,210
g... u... n.

810
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,370
Come on, Stephanie. Time's running out.

811
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:42,130
Talk now or pay later.

812
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,120
Okay,okay. I...

813
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,600
I.. I did take the gun.

814
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,520
Okay,but I didn't kill Len.

815
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,260
Okay,I gave the gun to James.

816
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,920
He shot him. He did it...

817
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,400
Look, I was gonna get Drew's money.

818
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,360
He was gonna get Len's.

819
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,780
But I never shot anyone,okay?

820
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:02,110
We were gonna frame
Drew,but James shot Len...

821
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,320
Not me.

822
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,690
Not me.

823
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,820
They've been in there a long
time,my partner and Stephanie.

824
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,360
I wonder what they're talking about.

825
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,020
Stephanie's pretty high-strung.

826
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,740
You notice that?

827
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,220
Oh,god. What did you tell them?

828
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,140
What have you done?

829
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,040
What have you done?

830
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,780
James.

831
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:29,440
You put your bag on the
hillside,knowing we'd find it.

832
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:36,930
You didn't count on hot Easley, finding
it first and burying it again.

833
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,810
That was gonna be his treasure.

834
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,810
That bag of stolen stuff I
found was gonna be my ticket.

835
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,610
Well, if you want to stay at my house
for a while,that's not a problem.

836
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:51,910
Sure,boss.

837
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,780
Just might do that.

838
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:56,700
That way,he can use the bathroom when
he wants to without committing a felony.

839
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,560
Well,a man's gotta stay minty.

840
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,890
Isn't that right, Easley?

841
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,310
That's right.

842
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,840
See? Minty.

843
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:16,850
{\a6}Detective Carl Ames (retired)
Lead Detective Crews murder case

844
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,010
And the daughter,where was she?

845
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,200
She was at a sleepover.

846
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,780
How many times I gotta tell you that?

847
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,800
She was there,wasn't she?

848
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,250
Her bed was unmade.

849
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:45,080
She was there when it
happened,not at a sleepover.

850
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,440
Rachel was in the house.

851
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,110
Hello?

852
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,370
Hello.

853
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,370
Jeez,Charlie.

854
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,750
You scared me.

855
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,260
I didn't mean to.

856
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,980
What are you doing here?

857
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,410
I,uh...

858
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,710
I wanna ask you to do something,and
I just need you to do it.

859
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,240
Charlie,tell me why you're here.

860
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,780
I need you to drop
Neil Cudahy as a client.

861
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,710
You need me to?

862
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,250
What does that mean?

863
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:13,040
You know what that means.

864
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,860
Do you want to save him,Connie?

865
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,410
I'm just defending him.

866
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:19,130
Do you wanna save him like you saved me?

867
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:22,520
'Cause he's not me,connie.

868
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,280
What are you asking?

869
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:27,240
I'm asking you to drop Neil Cudahy.

870
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,510
That's all you're asking?

871
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,760
Yeah.

872
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,850
Don't back away from this,Charlie.

873
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,870
You started it when
you came here tonight.

874
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,560
I just want you to drop Neil Cudahy.

875
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:46,430
You don't have the right to ask that.

876
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,780
Unless you want that right.

877
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,010
Do you,Charlie?

878
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,960
I was looking for you,and
I didn't even know it.

879
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:04,380
And now you're here,and
I can't have you.

880
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,220
You're married.

881
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:08,200
And if I weren't?

882
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,890
You have a husband.

883
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:15,080
And I think about...You...

884
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,780
when I'm with him.

885
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,240
I need you to be all the way in.

886
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:30,460
And if you can't be all the way in...

887
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,720
Then I need you all the way... Out.

888
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:42,040
You know I can't do this.

889
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,860
Yeah.

890
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,280
Okay.

891
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:56,750
Whatever it is that you're doing
is keeping you from being here.

892
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,970
You're still in prison.

00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:07,510
The next time you're gonna have to
get another lawyer to get you out.

894
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,610
He was here this afternoon.

895
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,700
I saw him.

896
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:27,050
He asked if I would buy
him a giant rubber band.

897
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,570
Said he used to have one but that it...

898
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:30,580
Dried up.

899
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,170
Lost its snap.

900
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,400
Poor easy.

901
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,510
I thought telling the
truth would set him free.

902
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,160
When's that ever worked?

903
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,500
She saw him.

904
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:31,180
She saw the killer.
