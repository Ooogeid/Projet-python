1
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,460
"I'm with stupid."

2
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,340
the arrow's pointing up.

3
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,420
Isn't it supposed to point
at the person next to you?

4
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,490
I guess he was admitting the truth.

5
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,220
That he was stupid?

6
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,880
That no one knows anything.

7
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,350
I know he's dead.

8
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,840
That's not the truth. It's just a fact.

9
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,860
Looks like a rose.

10
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,910
Oh,you gonna tell me that's the truth?

11
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,010
No,that's just a dead flower.

12
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,950
we're putting up a parking garage.

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,850
Eight floors,500 spaces.

14
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,730
What was it before?

15
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,010
Storefronts.

16
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,710
Most of them vacant for years.

17
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,250
We're gonna need to know the name
of the store that was in this space.

18
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,980
Yeah,i can find that out for you.

19
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,070
The guy's been in the ground
for who knows how long.

20
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,680
We dig him out,then
after we're done with him,

21
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,200
we're gonna put him back in.

22
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,070
Is there somewhere else you
think maybe he should go?

23
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,140
Los palmas zen center.

24
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,930
In business for two years.

25
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,620
From 1995 to 1997.

26
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,170
went out of business because?

27
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,030
The owner,a guy named tim chang,

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,240
skipped out owing three months rent.

29
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,570
What exactly is a zen center?

30
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,550
It's a place where people interested in
their spiritual journey sit and do nothing.

31
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,200
Which,as it turns
out,is nearly impossible.

32
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,290
Getting buried alive part
of that spiritual journey?

33
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,900
Not as a rule,no.

34
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,110
Though every center has its own way.

35
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,040
"tim chang."

36
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,600
i.D.Expired 1998.

37
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,450
he's been down there the whole time.

38
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,900
Oh,look at this.

39
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,240
I used to have one just like this.

40
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,030
I remember this model.

41
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,460
So cute.

42
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,210
Stored,like,ten numbers.

43
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,870
The battery is toast.

44
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,430
But i can get information
off of the chip.

45
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,100
Last numbers called,date and time.

46
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,490
Who remembers their
number from ten years ago?

47
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,220
I do.

48
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,220
But it wasn't a phone number.

49
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,150
Prison Number

50
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,190
Looks like he dialed these two numbers
a bunch of times on november 30th,1997.

51
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,840
give me a few hours,i can get
the backdated reverse directory

52
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,890
and give you names to
go with those numbers.

53
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,800
Or we could just call one.

57
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,260
Tim chang.

58
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,520
I haven't thought of him in years.

59
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,620
Ten years.

60
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,300
They found him
underneath the zen center?

61
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,400
Someone buried him while
he was still living.

62
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,590
My god.

63
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,870
How can they even tell that?

64
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,940
He had inhaled dirt into his lungs.

65
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,940
What was your relationship
with tim chang?

66
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,070
I didn't have one.

67
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,450
But when we dialed that
number,it rang here in your house.

68
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,530
This wasn't my house ten years ago.

69
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,710
It's my husband's house.

70
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,350
I moved here after we were married.

71
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,300
I was the one who had
the relationship with tim.

72
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,480
Luke,these are the detectives
i told you would be stopping by.

73
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,020
Detectives,this is my
husband,professor luke dujardin.

74
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,300
We're both on staff at
u.S.C.Particle physics.

75
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,740
But we are not actually on staff there.

76
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,810
We are just more likely to be on staff
there than not to be on staff there.

77
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,160
Don't play with them,darling.
They're not your students.

78
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,340
They are the police.

79
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,650
So they must know
everything is in motion.

80
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,360
And the particles within
everything are never in one place.

81
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:51,980
Therefore,if it's never in
one place,it never is,is it?

82
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,800
So i'm always in motion.

83
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,820
I'm never in one place.

84
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,980
I'm never here.

85
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,970
Just more like to be here
thanan not to be here.

86
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,170
I'm not here.

87
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,450
You like that,don't you?

88
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,980
If only that were true.

89
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,790
Luke,they're here to
talk about master chang.

90
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,330
We uncovered his body under
what used to be the zen center.

91
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,850
Oh,no.

92
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,830
And all this time...

93
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Professor dujardin,what was
your relationship with tim chang?

94
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,070
12 years ago i suffered from
a common ailment in my field.

95
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,570
I had a crisis of faith.

96
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,380
If you look at
anything too closely--

97
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,560
it starts to lose its meaning.

98
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,860
And your crisis of faith,master
chang helped you through this?

99
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,210
Yes,he did.

100
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,510
You wouldn't happen to know where
you were when tim chang went missing?

101
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,110
That was ten years ago.

102
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,100
Does anyone know where
they were ten years ago?

103
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,440
I'm pretty sure i do.

104
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,510
We looked for him when he went missing.

105
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,810
We went to the zen
center every day,but--

106
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,700
amy,those two pot heads
with the videotapes.

107
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,800
Videotapes?

108
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,270
They made an instructional tape
with master chang and sold it online.

109
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,500
They were so peculiar.

110
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,810
I can't remember their names though.

111
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,750
See that car,not here.

112
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,870
That building,not here.

113
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,260
Not actually here,just more
likely to be here than not be here.

114
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,260
That dog,not here.

115
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,070
That girl,not here.

116
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,540
Too bad about that.

117
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,170
This street.

118
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,690
This city.

119
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,620
Everything.

120
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,000
Not here.

121
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,120
If you're not here,then how
come i can still see you?

122
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,070
I guess not here.

123
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,920
If you understand
physics,which i really don't.

124
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,470
- Hello.
- **

125
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,520
Those tapes were made by a company
based out of an apartment in palms.

126
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,140
No longer in business.

127
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,510
I did,however,track
down the owners' names.

128
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,980
Can you track down the owner's address?

129
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,980
Master tim,dead?

130
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,190
Zen master flash,buried alive?

131
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,540
That is wrong.

132
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,690
"zen master flash"?

133
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,390
Yeah,that's what we used to call him.

134
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,830
Because he was a zen master with flash.

135
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,340
You made an instructional
tape with tim chang?

136
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,850
Not one of our best sellers.

137
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,120
Made it out of some crappy
apartment you used to have?

138
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,370
Different part of town.

139
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,700
Not so much money back then,huh?

140
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,300
That was before quickie-mate.Com.

141
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,530
You heard of us,right?

142
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,440
I'm not really up to date with
all the dots and their coms.

143
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,080
Quickie-mate.

144
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,330
A mate in a minute.

145
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,360
It's why we're not
living in palms anymore.

146
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,490
Was master chang aware that
you were using marijuana?

147
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,290
Uh,i would have to say yes.

148
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,320
Very aware.

149
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,800
And did it cause any conflict?

150
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,950
Only when we wouldn't share.

151
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,390
Zen master liked to
be one with the bong.

152
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,630
Didn't you think it was odd
that he just disappeared one day?

153
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,960
No,we thought it was zen.

154
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,470
Oh,sherri,ginger,say hi.

155
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,660
Hi.

156
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,250
Our wives.

157
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,260
Are these more investors?

158
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,870
No,they're cops.

159
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,760
You want a beer?

160
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,920
They're cops,sherri.

161
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,310
Cops get thirsty.

162
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Don't cops get thirsty?

163
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,380
All the cops i know get thirsty.

164
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,870
No thank you.

165
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,490
We're working,and one of us
is a recovering alcoholic.

166
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,120
I'm still in pre-hab.

167
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,080
Good luck with that.

168
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,310
Thanks.

169
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,490
We've been married for two years.

170
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,020
Quickie-mate.Com.

171
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,540
Was supplying tim chang drugs the
sole nature of your relationship?

172
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:43,030
No,mostly we went to the
zen center for the girls.

173
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,540
The place was loaded with,like,broken
yoga chicks,you know the kind.

174
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,060
You two didn't date a
lot in high school,huh?

175
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,960
Or in college?

176
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,070
Yeah,well,that all
changed when we got rich.

177
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,450
Do you know where you were
when tim chang went missing?

178
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,350
That was... Ten years ago.

179
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,120
Who knows where they were ten years ago?

180
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:07,350
I used to think,what
if i had believed him?

181
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,040
{\a6}Jennifer Conover
Ex-Wife of Charlie Crews

182
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,850
What if i hadn't walked away?

183
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,350
Would he be here now?

184
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,310
I mean,we would have come through
this together. We would have won.

185
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,020
But i didn't believe him.

186
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,810
And i've learned it's
better not to think that way.

187
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
- Oh,for god's sake.
- Hey,mark.

188
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,920
My ex-wife around?

189
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,090
This isn't pulling me over.

190
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,830
This is now trespassing.

191
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,660
This will only take a minute.

192
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,910
Hey,jenn,you around? Jennifer?

193
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,330
It's okay,mark.

194
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,350
- I got this.
- Are you sure?

195
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,410
Yeah,i'm sure.

196
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,360
Go on in.

197
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,660
He's very tall.

198
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,760
I didn't know you liked tall men.

199
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,520
If i'd known,maybe i
could have been taller.

200
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,570
Are you in counseling,charlie?

201
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,870
You know what today is?

202
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,650
Yes,charlie. I do.

203
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,180
15 years. Not bad.

204
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,560
It's our anniversary.

205
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,120
I understand how today
might be painful for you.

206
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,130
You were a pretty bride,jenn.

207
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,510
Smokin',i think is what
the kids say now,right?

208
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,850
- Hey,mark,you know she was a smoking bride?
- okay.

209
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,410
You showed up,you pissed on my husband.

210
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,310
You're doing whatever
it is you're doing to me.

211
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,470
You can go now.

212
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,770
I came here today,jenn,because
i made a promise to you.

213
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,010
I know i'm not exactly
married to you anymore. But...

214
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,680
Happy anniversary.

215
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,810
You didn't.

216
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,810
A promise is a promise,jenn.

217
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,210
I promised you one.

218
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,330
A promise is a promise.

219
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,420
You can't leave this horse here,crews.

220
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,980
It's not really there,mark.

221
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,940
I mean,it's physics,it's complicated.

222
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,540
But trust me,it--
it's not actually here.

223
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,080
What's that smell?

224
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,210
Horse.

225
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,810
You curious why?

226
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,620
Not remotely.

227
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,200
Hello.

228
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,040
Okay,reverse directory
on the third number.

229
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,960
Graziella molina has had
the same number for 45 years.

230
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,360
Did she go to the zen center?

231
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,010
No,but her son did.

232
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,670
He used to live at home,but
has since moved out.

233
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,280
Can you send me his address?

234
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,900
Can you say "please"?

235
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,100
Please?

236
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,320
Can i help you?

237
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,110
I'm looking for eric molina.

238
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,430
Uh,that's him sparring out on the mat.

239
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,580
Which one's molina?

240
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,610
He's the one that's still standing.

241
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,780
that's tim chang,isn't it?

242
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,570
Zen master flash.

243
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,020
********

244
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:44,270
His body was under the zen center.

245
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,140
That's right.

246
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,690
We tracked the numbers tim
chang dialed on his cell phone.

247
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,510
One of them was your mom,eric.

248
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,770
She told us where to find you.

249
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,680
I was living with her back then.

250
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,570
My life is here now.

251
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,930
You don't seem too broken up
to hear that your master's dead.

252
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,000
His body has lost its vitality.

253
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,930
His spirit exists still.

254
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,260
It will find another
vessel and return someday.

255
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,000
We're curious about those pictures
you went down on your knees for.

256
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,070
I bow to master chang after every fight.

257
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,950
Yeah,why is that?

258
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,530
Out of respect.

259
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,470
I would not be alive if
it wasn't for master chang.

260
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,020
Master chang recreated me.

261
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,260
How did he do that?

262
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,160
He crushed what i was.

263
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,090
And allowed a new me to step forward.

264
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,350
Didn't like who you were,eric?

265
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,800
No,sir.

266
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,510
I did not.

267
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,060
I was in a gang when i met master chang.

268
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,580
Master chang made it hard on you.

269
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,640
|| for my own good.

270
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,510
You're searching for something.

271
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,070
Aren't you?

272
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,370
I'm searching for the person
who killed master chang.

273
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,820
No.

274
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,620
Something else.

275
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,200
You got that look.

276
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,510
And master chang had it too.

277
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,800
He was searching for something.

278
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,710
Did he find it,eric?

279
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,830
You can't find it,man.

280
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,990
It's an illusion.

281
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,720
It's not there.

282
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,520
You want to know when he went missing?

283
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,090
it's a long time ago.
Who could remember that?

284
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,830
I was at my mother's.

285
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,020
I was sick the entire
week. You can ask her.

286
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,520
Something else you need to say?

287
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,960
*********

288
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,750
But i was always worried|| he
would not be able to save himself.

289
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,280
He made me strong,but he was weak.

290
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,220
How was he weak?

291
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,260
He allowed his own flesh to be weak.

292
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,650
You know,he let those two,ryan
and sean,take him to dark places.

293
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,720
You mean the pot?

294
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,010
pot? It was much worse than that.

295
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,520
He let them use him.

296
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,060
Use his body.

297
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,840
I mean,he would come
back from them begging.

298
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,410
Begging for forgiveness.

299
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,610
What would you come back as?

300
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,560
Reincarnation.

301
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,370
Don't limit yourself.
You can choose an animal.

302
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,840
This one time should
be plenty. Thank you.

303
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,530
I'd like to come back as
a giant flemish rabbit.

304
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,640
15 pounds of pure bunny.

305
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,570
Or a whale.

306
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,860
Can you imagine being a whale
thousands of feet under water?

307
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,180
Can you imagine that?

308
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,190
Is it quiet down there?

309
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,850
you need to be on the list.

310
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,930
i bought my ex-wife a horse.

311
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,730
Crews,it's really loud in here.

312
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,810
It sounded like you said you
bought your ||-wife a horse.

313
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,780
i know you,don't i?

314
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,570
I'm one of the investors.

315
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,260
Right.

316
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,260
You want a room with a
camera or just a room?

317
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,390
Oh,you brought a friend.

318
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,820
That's cool,so did i.

319
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,770
Why don't you go ahead
and we'll catch up.

320
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,160
We'll get a room with a camera,okay?

321
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,410
Okay.

322
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,940
Dating was simpler when i was younger.

323
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,340
This isn't dating.

324
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,200
No,i guess it's not.

325
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,790
That was some party.

326
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,690
I mean,that's the kind of party
you dream about your whole life

327
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,890
but you very rarely get to see.

328
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,410
I mean,i-- i've never
seen it. Have you?

329
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,590
No,mm-mm.

330
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,250
I have never seen a party like that.

331
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,670
She's never seen a party like
that because she's kind of shy.

332
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,900
I am.

333
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,300
But also because...

334
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,920
It's just really against the law.

335
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,490
I mean,what did we see in there?

336
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,650
Oh,pimping and pandering.

337
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,700
Pandering.

338
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,090
Not really sure what that is.

339
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,090
But it usually comes after
pimping,and it's not good.

340
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,140
What do you want?

341
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,380
You left some things out this afternoon
when we asked you about tim chang.

342
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,020
You remember eric molina?

343
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:14,860
We heard from him || that things got a
little extreme between you and tim chang.

344
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,700
Isn't that right,boys?

345
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,080
Zen master flash didn't do
anything he didn't want to do.

346
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,200
He didn't ask to do.

347
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,090
What did he ask to do?

348
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,470
He was dark,okay?

349
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,840
The guy liked to go all the way down.

350
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,670
He could take a lot of pain,and
he liked to have it put on film.

351
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,130
People would pay to see it.

352
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,590
He wanted to do it.

353
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,050
They wanted to see it.
But we didn't kill him.

354
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,580
We thought master flash took off.

355
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,210
Figures that freak
molina put you on to us.

356
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,140
|| he wanted to be just
like zen master flash.

357
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,870
Did everything he did.

358
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,690
Till that fight. You
remember that fight?

359
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,940
That fight was awesome.

360
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,720
I thought zen master was dead
the way eric was hitting him.

361
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,650
When it was over,zen master
threw eric out of the center.

362
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,380
|| banished him for life.

363
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,950
We weren't even allowed
to mention eric's name.

364
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,910
And if we did,we got thrown out too.

365
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,700
Coroner's report confirms that
tim chang had broken six ribs

366
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,060
and one of his hands a
month before his death.

367
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,990
It sounds like he'd been in a fight.

368
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:22,420
I swear it sounded like you said
you bought your ex-wife a horse.

369
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,600
It was loud.

370
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,950
Also,and i might be wrong about this,

371
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,620
but i think people were
having sex in that house.

372
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,110
Master chang?

373
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,400
I'm here.

374
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,090
|| i'm lost.

375
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,950
I know.

376
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,250
how has your relationship with detective
crews changed now that you've become a d.A.?

377
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,540
{\a6}Constance Griffiths
Ex-Attorney for Charlie Crews

378
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,370
Detective crews and i
will always be friends.

379
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,850
But in my role as district attorney
i will work with him in the same way

380
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,600
that i work with any member of the lapd.

381
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,930
uh,reese.

382
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,620
You remember assistant
district attorney griffiths.

383
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,790
no reason to be so formal.

384
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,650
Just call me connie.

385
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,090
Good to see you again,connie.

386
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,530
You too.

387
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,300
I really like your dress.

388
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,190
Thank you. I got it in new york.

389
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,650
Constance went to new york.

390
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,090
But then she had to
come back from new york.

391
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,430
So now she's not in new york anymore.

392
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,620
I'm saying "new york" a lot,aren't i?

393
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,430
|| he does that sometimes.

394
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,590
I know. I usually just wait it out.

395
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,600
Me too.

396
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,310
Can we talk for a minute?

397
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,530
Remember the last time i came down here?

398
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,720
I do.

399
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,670
You warned me to stay away from ames.

400
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,180
I wish you would have listened to me.

401
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,290
I didn't kill him.

402
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,840

422
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:47,180
You can explain to me why your detective crews
is no longer a suspect in the carl ames shooting.

423
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,480
He killed ames.

424
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,860
He had the motivation.

425
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,000
You find the means and opportunity.

426
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,070
I'm gonna be very careful
what i say now,jack.

427
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:01,570
I have a witness who reports seeing two
men leaving the scene of the ames killing.

428
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,600
When we find these men,if they
connect to crews,i will go after crews.

429
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,430
if they connect to somebody
else that's who i will go after.

430
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:17,800
15 years ago this branch of the
bank of los angeles was held up.

431
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,820
There was a shootout.

432
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,370
$18 million goes missing.

433
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:24,230
A small group of gunmen
could hold out in here forever

434
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,640
against the cops out on the street.

435
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:30,620
The only way to take 'em
out would be with a sniper.

436
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:34,690
And there's only one place
that sniper could take the shot.

437
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,460
I don't like heights.

438
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,250
Then don't look down

439
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,970
oh,i looked down.

440
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,820
I couldn't help myself.

441
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,350
Oh,i looked down again.

442
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,080
If you want a clean shot of that bank,

443
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,610
the only place to do it
is from here. right here.

444
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:03,280
This is where s.W.A.T.Happened t||be training
the day the bank of los angeles was held up.

445
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,980
S.W.A.T.Leader was jack reese.

446
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,250
Jack reese was talking with ames
right before ames got killed.

447
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,180
I scared ames. Ames went to reese.

448
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,190
They were arguing about
me. I saw 'em say my name.

449
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,590
now ames is dead.

450
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:22,630
What does the bank of los angeles holdup have
to do with the detective who put you away?

451
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,220
They both have jack reese in common.

452
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,630
Charlie,i'm not robin,am i?

453
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,550
You know,batman and robin.

454
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,810
Trusty sidekick.

455
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,600
You mean,like,in tights?

456
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,200
No,ted.

457
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,350
You are not robin.

458
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,920
You're not here. Are you?

459
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,880
No,i'm here,eric.

460
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,670
Don't you worry.

461
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,900
Why'd you run from us?

462
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:07,030
'Cause when you came back i could
see you found out i lied to you.

463
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,020
We found out about the fight.

464
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,840
About how you nearly killed tim chang.

465
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:13,910
We found out you got thrown
out of the zen center.

466
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,570
Master chang banished you.

467
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,280
And others weren't even
allowed to speak your name.

468
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,620
That make you angry,eric?

469
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,010
That'd make me angry.

470
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,860
Is that what you fought about?

471
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,220
We fought about trust.

472
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,950
Did he betray your trust?

473
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:36,110
All i had was master
chang and the zen center.

474
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:41,730
On my own,who i was, was nothing.

475
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,600
- They were--
- everything to you.

476
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,780
How did he betray your trust?

477
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,520
Was it because of something
he was doing himself?

478
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,220
No,what he did to himself,he
did somewhere else.

479
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,260
Did he do something at the zen center?

480
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,090
The girls that came in that
center,they trusted master chang.

481
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,030
He would take 'em to his office.

482
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:07,710
I mean,he broke the
trust for pretty girls.

483
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:12,580
That trust,it was all i had.

484
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,420
All we have is his body.

485
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,080
So you're gonna stay with us awhile

486
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,850
until we see if you left anything
behind when you buried him.

487
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,850
I didn't kill him.

488
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,890
I loved him.

489
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,400
I wanted to kill him.

490
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:30,100
Yeah,i tried to kill him.

491
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,540
But i didn't.

492
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,900
I loved him.

493
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,970
If he banished you,how
come he called you?

494
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,320
He called to say good-bye.

495
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,640
He said he was leaving.

496
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,960
But wouldn't say why.

497
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:02,590
You said you were master chang.

498
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,100
You said you were lost.

499
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:18,240
Just to be clear about this,i
am not talking to a dead guy.

500
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,520
I don't talk to dead guys.

501
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,470
I'm talking to myself.

502
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,310
There just--just happens
to be a dead guy here.

503
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:32,130
The man who killed my friends,the
man i served those 12 years for,

504
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,340
what do i do when i find him?

505
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,980
Okay.

506
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,830
Good talking to you.

507
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,130
I'm gonna go find your killer.

508
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:55,560
Eric thought you were master chang.

509
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,650
He'd just been hit by a car.

510
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,810
Reese.

511
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,610
Come meditate with me.

512
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,550
That's okay.

513
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,540
I think i'll just watch.

514
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,160
It will make you happy.

515
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,060
It's not gonna make me happy.

516
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,190
If it doesn't make you happy,

517
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:20,080
i promise not to say another word
to you for the rest of the day.

518
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,580
Where else are you gonna
get an offer like that?

519
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,240
All right.

520
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,360
How do i do this?

521
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,220
Look straight ahead.

522
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,620
See?

523
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,230
Happy?

524
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,730
So everyone going to that zen center
was just completely screwed up. Right?

525
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:58,430
People go there seeking peace.

526
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,340
People seek what they don't have.

527
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,140
Only troubled people seek peace.

528
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,170
I've changed my mind.

529
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,570
I want to come back as a panda.

530
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,680
Really?

531
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,980
They're so cute.

532
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,280
They're not cute.

533
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,040
They just seem cute.
They're actually very mean.

534
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,640
We just have one thing
we need to clear up.

535
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,860
It's not a big thing.

536
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,570
We need to know if you lied to us.

537
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,390
Excuse me?

538
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:28,180
What detective reese means is when you said
did not have a relationship with master chang,

539
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:31,160
did you lie about the part where you
had a relationship with master chang?

540
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,850
You went to the zen
center too,didn't you,amy?

541
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,580
That's you.

542
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,940
Younger,but you,right?

543
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,190
I would drive luke there.

544
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,540
He's not a very good driver.

545
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,380
His mind is always somewhere else.

546
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,470
I understand that.

547
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,880
Detective reese doesn't let me drive.

548
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,630
We also heard that master chang would take you into
his office for a little one on one enlightenment

549
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,030
while your professor was out on the mat.

550
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,230
That's not true.

551
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,170
Who said that?

552
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,890
Who sits in the third chair?

553
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,940
It's a trio.

554
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,770
- You and your husband play?
- Yes.

555
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:07,450
- Who sits in the third chair?
- My son.

556
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,470
I'd like you to leave.

557
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,650
Did your husband luke know that
you were having sex with tim chang?

558
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,550
I wasn't. That is a lie.

559
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,710
As a rule,older men get really
upset about stuff like that.

560
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,280
Is it true that those zen masters
know all the secret places?

561
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:23,330
Okay,that's enough. I won't
be offended in my own house.

562
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,730
Alec,say hello to
detectives crews and reese.

563
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,270
Hello.

564
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,130
It was a pleasure to meet you.

565
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,380
He is a very respectful child.

566
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,810
Yes. Yes,he is.

567
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,620
How old is he?

568
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,500
Just about ten.

569
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,330
May i ask who his birth parents are?

570
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:12,030
I am his birth mother.

571
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,440
But we had trouble conceiving.

572
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,000
And his father?

573
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,680
It was an anonymous donor.

574
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,080
You understand why we're gonna
need to see proof of that.

575
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,150
Of course. We have the documents.

576
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,610
And,uh,i'm having
trouble with the dates.

577
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,270
Maybe you can help me.

578
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:32,270
Exactly how long were you together
before you decided to use a donor?

579
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,790
You know who he looks like?

580
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,610
We have master chang's body.

581
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,830
And we're gonna get a sample of his dna.

582
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:45,770
And then-- then we're gonna get
a warrant for the dna of your son.

583
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,490
Now,i've had some experience with dna.

584
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,130
And it's pretty foolproof.

585
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,960
Just leave him alone.
Just leave us alone.

586
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,690
What is that dna test gonna prove?

587
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,470
That alec is your son with tim chang?

588
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,670
Alec is who he thinks he is.

589
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,800
He's happy.

590
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,710
- Why does anyone have to find out--
- the truth?

591
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,700
What is the truth?

592
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:17,590
We met at the point where physics
and buddhism came together.

593
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:24,710
But you understand,after what
chang did,i did what i did.

594
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,810
What did you do,luke?

595
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:35,060
If i tell you,you must promise me there
will be no dna testing and no trial.

596
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,030
We can do that.

597
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,720
Alec is my son.

598
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,180
He loves me.

599
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:48,820
And i will not have him going through life
knowing he's the evidence that sent me away.

600
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,660
I killed tim chang.

601
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,730
I caught him with amy.

602
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,290
We would dig behind the zen center.

603
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,730
It was a zen meditation.

604
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,780
Dig a hole,fill it up.

605
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,420
I pushed him in one of those.

606
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,810
Filled it up.

607
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,680
he was out in the back.

608
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,960
But i was afraid about
coyotes,so i brought it in.

609
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:22,310
Hey,don't get too comfortable.

610
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,280
You're not actually here.

611
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,710
You're talking to the horse.

612
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,140
Let me ask you something.

613
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:37,270
Even if something isn't actually
there,just more likely to be there,

614
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,560
why would you still look for
it if you knew where it was?

615
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,300
You're still talking to the horse.

616
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,250
Reese.

617
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:52,020
If he knew where he was,why
was he still looking for him?

618
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,660
You tell us you killed tim chang.

619
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,010
I did.

620
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,480
You killed him,and then you raised alec?

621
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,810
I love alec.

622
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,960
I know you do.

623
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:08,110
But i think you loved
tim chang too,luke.

624
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,760
Chang was broken.

625
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:14,610
But he was my zen master.

626
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,650
He helped me to the light.

627
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,580
And when you look at alec,you seem
him there,you see master chang.

628
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:22,310
But that--that's
where it bumps for me.

629
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,130
We have these phone records here.

630
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,010
Phone records?

631
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,730
Luke has confessed.

632
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,200
Why can't you just leave him alone?

633
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:32,570
To tim chang's cell from your
house,your office,and your cell.

634
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,970
We talked frequently.

635
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:36,860
Luke,you made all these
calls after he went missing.

636
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:39,190
'Cause i was worried about him.

637
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,750
Maybe you killed master chang,luke,

638
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,360
but i think it is more
likely that you did not.

639
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:53,440
Because if you knew he was
dead,if you knew where he was,

640
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,480
why were you still looking for him?

641
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,250
i killed him.

642
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,500
You left something with
him,with master chang.

643
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,280
He was holding something.

644
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,100
What was it?

645
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,660
Where are you going?

646
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,400
We're dropping the charges.

647
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,210
But i--i
killed him.

648
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,190
No,you didn't.

649
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,630
So we can go?

650
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,570
Actually,you need to go
downstairs to children's services.

651
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,530
Why do i need to do that?

652
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:28,540
They're concerned that your house might not be the
appropriate environment in which to raise your son in.

653
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,410
Because they want to know if luke
here didn't kill master chang,

654
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:34,540
then who was he protecting
with his confession?

655
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:40,120
Because,amy,you are now the lead
suspect in the tim chang murder.

656
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,890
will you take care of our son?

657
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,110
A rose.

658
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:05,260
i threw a rose down there.

659
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,980
That's what he called me.

660
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,720
His rose.

661
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,470
But he thought he could leave me.

662
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,480
And that's where he was wrong.

663
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,750
okay,they're gonna put
you back in the ground now.

664
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,070
You take care of yourself.

665
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:40,870
i'll call you.

666
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,180
Where'd you get this?

667
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,880
You don't wanna know.

668
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,980
You know,you're right.
I don't wanna know.

669
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:23,670
Charlie,this guy was a serious cop.

670
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:26,640
I mean,look at some
of what this guy did.

671
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:30,600
Serious cop with serious friends.

672
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,480
You sure you want to go after him?

673
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,980
Ted,i appreciate your
help with this,i do.

674
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,990
If you want to walk away,i understand.

675
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:44,930
ok,****

676
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,460
Let me do some financials on jack reese.

677
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:51,660
If you think he was in on the bank
of l.A.that money went somewhere.

678
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,470
Yeah,okay.

679
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,490
What are you looking for?

680
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,710
If you want to know how good a
cop a cop is,you ask other cops.

681
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:03,650
You want to know how bad a cop
is,you ask his confidential informant.

682
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,560
There.

683
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:10,900
Jack reese's registered
confidential informant '91 to '96.

684
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:13,190
kyle hollis.

685
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,340
Let's see what kind of record kyle has.

686
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:23,500
It still smells of horse in here.

687
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,910
I kinda like that smell.

688
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,560
That is no surprise.

689
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,980
Maybe we could get a dog.

690
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,370
You think we should get a dog,charlie?

691
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,320
Hmm,charlie?

692
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,530
Charlie,what is it?

693
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:44,450
Kyle hollis,jack reese's informant,

694
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,210
there a mug shot here
from his last arrest,1995.

695
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:01,390
that's the picture rachel drew.

696
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:06,020
****

697
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,030
That's him,charlie.

698
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,270
That's the killer.

699
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,750
What are you thinking about?

700
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,370
I was thinking about
where i'm going next.
