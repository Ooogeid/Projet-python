Evil...And His Brother Ziggy

2
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,300
it's supposed to be my kid's dog.

3
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,360
But guess who cleans up his crap.

4
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,050
If I clean up his crap, he's my dog.

5
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,870
So I tell my kids, he's
my dog. And they cried.

6
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,030
So sad.

7
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,670
Stewart.

8
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,650
You may remember him from when
he dragged you out of my car.

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,100
He was just doing his job.

10
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,920
He didn't know you were a cop.

11
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,170
No hard feelings?

12
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,440
No hard feelings.

13
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,130
That's your zen thing, isn't it?

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,780
Yeah. That's my zen thing.

15
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,030
What'd you think, I had
only one car, one driver?

16
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,610
You know what I pay ever
year in personal security?

17
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,670
If you wanted to talk to me,
all you had to do was call.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,080
Like I said, I've been
meaning to call you.

19
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,630
To help with your charity work.

20
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,600
Yes, with my charity work.

21
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,130
I know what you think about me.

22
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,020
But I have nothing to hide.

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,410
I tell you what. I'm having a little
fundraiser here on friday night.

24
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,500
Why don't you come? It's a plus-one
ticket. You can bring a guest.

25
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,390
That pretty ex-wife of yours? Or that
convict roommate. Or that partner.

26
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:36,320
I'd say she was hot, but I'd never
say that about jack reese's daughter.

27
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,250
Nice boots.

28
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,880
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

29
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,370
The new york attitude I can handle.

30
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,660
It's four generations of cop.

31
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,060
The three ex-wives who
all love you I can handle.

32
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,280
Well, they're an excellent resource
if you have any questions about me.

33
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,910
The sleeping with a superior
officer I can handle.

34
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,990
I know you can.

35
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,720
And when you call yourself
tidwell, I can even handle that.

36
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,880
- But this hair...
it has to go. - What--

37
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,900
You're humming.

38
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,040
You are humming, you know,
as in singing without words.

39
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,970
I wasn't humming. I don't hum.

40
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,460
When people don't know they're humming,
it usually means they're... happy.

41
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,370
I wasn't humming. And I'm
not happy. I'm in the desert.

42
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,640
I could live out here.

43
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,840
You could live out here?

44
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,770
There's no here here.

45
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,950
All there is is
here here.It's--

46
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,950
it's hot, it's dry, it's empty.

47
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,460
<i>{\a6}YOU ARE NOW ENTERING
SOVEREIGN TRIBAL LAND</i>

48
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,890
leaving U.S.Territory.

49
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,900
Sovereign tribal land.

50
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,980
I'm detective reese. This
is detective crews. Lapd.

51
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,740
We're expecting you.
Sheriff's deputy smith.

52
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,990
And this... is deputy john hawes.

55
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,710
Eagle arrow casino.

56
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,130
Trainloads of money headed this way.

57
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,270
"Your fortune awaits you."

58
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,960
Rancher chasing a stray found the body.

59
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,780
His dogs picked it up.

60
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,560
You didn't notice when
he missed roll call?

61
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,520
Hawes was a solo resident
deputy for this region.

62
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,120
Solo? He was stationed
out here by himself?

63
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,100
Yeah, just off the reservation.

64
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:22,490
Used to be more sheriffs, but they got phased
out once the tribe got their own police force.

65
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,740
With a casino about to open, you can't
really blame 'em for wanting their own cops.

66
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,510
How come deputy hawes stayed?

67
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,760
Couldn't say. Didn't know the man.

68
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,100
I drove in this morning to safeguard
the body until the lapd showed up.

69
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,070
I don't know why he
stayed. I wouldn't have.

70
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,950
Why's that?

71
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,280
Would you stay somewhere
where no one wanted you?

72
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,690
Must have been one tough old guy.

73
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,790
You two, you find who did this.

74
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,200
- Any of these hawes's car?
- No.

75
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,770
Probably came with the killer.

76
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,320
Before or after he died?

77
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,800
Shot somewhere else. Dumped here.

78
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,160
The agreement was lapd would be the
neutral party in this investigation.

79
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,510
No sheriffs.

80
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,290
We'd like you to ask him to leave now.

81
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,160
You people got no problem getting
rid of sheriffs on your own.

82
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,160
Stand down there, clark.

83
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,140
okay, you safeguarded hawes's body.

84
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:12,620
We're gonna ask you to go
so we can find who did this.

85
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,110
Captain ...

86
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,890
whitehatYou must be
detectives crews and reese.

87
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,900
Did you know deputy hawes?

88
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,290
We all knew deputy hawes.

89
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,990
Can you think of anybody
who'd want him dead?

90
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,240
I'd imagine nearly everyone
living on the reservation.

91
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,340
Well, maybe not the kids.

92
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,580
They didn't really get to know him.

93
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,640
That well-liked?

94
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,120
By law, county sheriffs may enter the
reservation if they're in hot pursuit.

95
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,600
Deputy hawes found a lot of
reasons to be in hot pursuit.

96
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,500
Any hot pursuits hotter
than other hot pursuits?

97
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,900
Captain whitehat, is there
someone who you think is a suspect?

98
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,440
Tomas shasta.

99
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,380
Member of the tribal council.

100
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,730
He and hawes had an incident last week.

101
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,820
Incident?

102
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,830
A fight.

103
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,420
On the reservation?

104
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,200
Punches were thrown. Threats were
madE. Both men were backed off.

105
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,890
Okay, well, we need to talk to him.

106
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,050
Shasta's a good man.

107
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,910
He just had enough of
hawes coming on the res.

108
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,000
That's what we need
to talk to him about.

109
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,550
- Overnight bag?
- That's right.

110
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,160
Because if we're questioning
you, then we're gonna lock you up?

111
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,320
Don't wanna sleep in my clothes.

112
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,050
They wanna talk to you about
hawes, tomas, about the fight.

113
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,350
I pointed out to sheriff
hawes he was breaking the law.

114
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,970
That angered him.

115
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,160
He was easily angered.

116
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,350
How was he breaking the law?

117
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,520
Every time he came on the
res, he was breaking the law.

118
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,140
Tomas, where were you last night?

119
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,930
He was with me.

120
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,060
Who are you?

121
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,590
This is anna, my fiancee.

122
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,950
Anyone else with you?

123
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,210
Tomas and I were at my
father's house last night.

124
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,320
Thank you, tomas.

125
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,030
Captain...

126
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:21,880
if hawes was the only sheriff left out
here, what station did he work out of?

127
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,790
This is the sheriff station?

128
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,020
And his home.

129
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,710
Got something here.

130
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,300
Ants.

131
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,120
Looks like they found
a couple drops of blood.

132
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,020
Using only the tools that
nature provides, I found a clue!

133
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,050
And using the tools that only
the postal system provides,

134
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,130
I'll mail it to the lab for analysis.

135
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,050
Hawes was the last sheriff.

136
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,670
The rest of his department is gone.

137
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,940
He's living out here just off
the reservation all by himself.

138
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,000
He's about to be the poorest person in
a land of millionaires? Why'd he stay?

139
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,700
Maybe he had nowhere else to go.

140
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,020
Or maybe he liked it out here.

141
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,420
hawes went outside without his gun.

142
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,060
He must not have felt a threat.

143
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,460
Someone checked in on him.

144
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,500
Heating instructions in
a woman's handwriting.

145
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,420
Hey, reese, look at this.

146
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,680
Deer stew--traditional
native american dishes.

147
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,880
Not everyone on the
reservation hated hawes.

148
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,140
any idea who would
have brought hawes food?

149
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,630
If anyone on the res was kind to
hawes, they kept it to themselves.

150
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,390
command one for captain whitehat.

151
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Go for whitehat.

152
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,790
Captain, we're going through the voicemail from last night
- should have done it earlier,

153
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,600
but with the dead sheriff and
those two L.A.Cops coming in,

154
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,160
- well, there's something you should hear.
- What is it?

155
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,730
Deputy hawes, captain.
He left a message for you.

156
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,000
Put the radio by the phone,
ramirez. Let me hear it.

157
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:03,030
Captain whitehat? This
is sheriff deputy hawes.

158
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,510
I need to speak...
guns and evil... evil...

159
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,030
you get that,
captain? He said--

160
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,700
yeah.Got it.

161
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,410
Evil?

162
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,560
Hawes had been out here a long time.

163
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,960
Guess he got superstitious.

164
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,290
Evil is superstition.

165
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,220
The gun that killed hawes is real.

166
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,000
Had hawes ever called about guns before?

167
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,250
No, never. I'll go
mail the blood sample.

168
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:35,840
Money, guns, and evil. And deer stew.

169
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,670
- Hey, reese?
- What?

170
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
Do you know what this vegetable is?

171
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,680
It's-- it's kinda
like a potato but not.

172
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,710
Like a not-potato.

173
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,400
Nothing about guns.

174
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,410
I've got a copy here of a letter that
hawes sent to the gaming commission.

175
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,430
He did not want that
casino coming in here.

176
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,600
Said it would have a negative
impact on the population.

177
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,300
You think tomas shasta thinks all
that money will have a negative impact?

178
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,200
I'll call back to L.A.,
Get hawes's phone dumped.

179
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,070
He was shot here, and driven out there.

180
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,230
Let's take that ride, see
if anyone saw anything.

181
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,690
No one saw anything,
because there's no one here.

182
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,340
There's nothing here.

183
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,000
- there's something here.
- What?

184
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,380
Stop the car.

185
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,140
Someone's having a moment
where hawes's body was found.

186
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,390
Let's not disturb them.

187
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:37,770
Walk it in from here?

188
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,730
Is that tomas's fiancee anna?

189
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,830
Why would the fiancee of the lead
suspect leave flowers for the victim?

190
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,850
Let's go find out.

191
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,660
Our car's gone.

192
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,530
Maybe evil took it.

193
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,250
Yes, our unmarked car.

194
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,490
Which is why we're taking a cab.

195
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,570
- Coming soon, the eagle arrow casino, resort and spa.
- Yes, stolen.

196
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,430
- Indulge in a world-class gaming experience
in our casino. - Yes, from the crime scene.

197
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,540
Thank you.

198
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,020
I think they were laughing.

199
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,900
Come indulge yourself. Another
vadas brothers experience.

200
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,090
The taxi wants us to
come indulge ourselves.

201
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,140
Reese, when was the last
time you indulged yourself?

202
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:02,060
Using only the tools the taxi provides, I
have found out something new about my partner.

203
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,050
If you listen closely,
you can hear them.

204
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,050
- Hear what?
- Bees.

205
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,770
We're looking for anna lakelin.

206
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,710
Is this about tomas and the sheriff?

207
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,570
That's right.

208
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,170
Let me just put these away.

209
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,780
Guy's got his hand in a bee hive.

210
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,690
You think that's
something you try to avoid.

211
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,480
30% of our food supply is
dependant upon bee pollination.

212
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:37,310
Fruits, nuts, vegetables, all need bees.

213
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,480
Well, I'm pretty sure you don't need
bees to make a bacon cheeseburger.

214
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,680
The tribal police already
questioned my daughter about tomas.

215
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,920
For his alibi?

216
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,010
Because anna has a
relationship with tomas.

217
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,520
But we're curious about her
relationship with sheriff's deputy hawes.

218
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,940
I'd like you to stop
cleaning that gun now, anna.

219
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,890
I'm going hunting.

220
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,400
I've got to clean my gun.

221
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:04,380
You might have to hold off
on hunting for a few days.

222
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,640
Just till we run
ballistics on that weapon.

223
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,010
- Hunting for?
- Deer.

224
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,170
Oh, to make stew.

225
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,600
You'll need nopales for that too, right?

226
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,800
Edible cactus. Need bees for it.

227
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,170
You use nopales to make the deer stew
you used to bring to deputy hawes.

228
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,750
The man you're about to marry is suspected of
killing a man that you cared about very much.

229
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,650
Tomas and hawes didn't get along.

230
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,790
They fought, there were threats.

231
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,660
Was it about tomas and the tribal
council wanting the sheriffs gone?

232
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,800
or was it about something else, anna?

233
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,200
Did they fight about you?

234
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,920
I don't know what they fought about.

235
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,520
What do men usually fight about?

236
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,710
Money. And women.

237
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,220
Deputy hawes left his gun in his trailer
when he stepped outside that night.

238
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,090
he trusted the person who killed him.

239
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,670
Tomas and I were here
together last night.

240
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,190
Crews.

241
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,330
Hawes?

242
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,350
Anna, is that the deputy's gun?

243
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,820
He gave it to me.

244
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,780
Why are you cleaning that gun, anna?

245
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,570
I'm going hunting.

246
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,560
It's what he would have wanted me to do.

247
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:25,360
Anna and tomas were
in the house all night.

248
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,960
Did you know about her
relationship with deputy hawes?

249
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,620
My daughter wasn't
born on the reservation.

250
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,000
She was city born, like me.

251
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,060
But these are our people.

252
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:39,890
We moved back here 20 years ago.

253
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,750
What happened 20 years ago?

254
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,210
My wife left us. Ran off.

255
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:51,300
That's why we came back.
For family. Anna hated it.

256
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:55,470
Got lost that first week out there, and
would have frozen to death overnight.

257
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,230
Would have? What saved her?

258
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,380
Deputy hawes.

259
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,580
He found her and brought her back to me.

260
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,920
They stayed close after that?

261
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,800
Well, it sounds strange
for me to say this.

262
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,770
He was like a father to her.

263
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,510
Taught her how to
ride, how to fish--

264
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,570
how to shoot?

265
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,210
When did he give her that rifle?

266
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,980
When she and tomas
got engaged last year.

267
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,870
It was a gift.

268
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,840
Tomas shasta take it badly that his bride to
be was cooking for the white sheriff's deputy?

269
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,030
it's all gonna change.

270
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,260
When the casino gets here.

271
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,060
All that money.

272
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,070
I hope he keeps his bees.

273
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,250
Something wrong with the car?

274
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,120
Out of gas, I guess.

275
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,690
You got a quarter tank there.

276
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,100
Must be something else, I guess.

277
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,650
I'll go out and check.

278
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,430
You have no right to speak to anna.

279
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,810
Are those men carrying weapons?

280
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,440
You mean like yourselves?

281
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,000
A sheriff's deputy was murdered, tomas.

282
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,370
You know we're not leaving
until we know who killed him.

283
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:54,390
You think I did it because
"me heap good shot"?

284
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,490
How come you didn't tell
us about anna and hawes?

285
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,740
Anna's extremely compassionate.
Always feeding strays.

286
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,390
Problem is, you feed
them, they come back.

287
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,680
Well.

288
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,020
Maybe hawes was coming back
for more than just the food.

289
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,110
Beautiful woman, your bride to be.

290
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,730
You seem to be real dialed in around
here. Maybe you could help us out.

291
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,680
We kinda got our car stolen.

292
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,780
Maybe you know who did it.

293
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,220
You still want to live around here?

294
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,670
More than ever.

295
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,010
It's gonna be night soon.

296
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,410
I am not taking that cab
all the way back to L.A.

297
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,780
They only had one room?

298
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:19,210
The hotel isn't even officially
open yet. We were lucky to get it.

299
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,290
I'm-- I'm
taking a bath.

300
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,580
See, you're already indulging yourself.

301
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,660
It was just as the taxi foretold.

302
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,820
Hey, did you want the bed nearest the
bathroom, or the bed nearest the door?

303
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,880
I don't care!

304
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,990
Girls like the beds closer
to the bathroom, right?

305
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,610
I don't care!

306
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,380
You think tomas did it?

307
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh, he has an alibi.

308
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:53,350
Yeah, he also has a pretty young fiancee
hanging out by the sheriff's trailer.

309
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,790
Maybe it was just about the nopales.

310
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,960
Yes, crews. I'm sure it
was just about the nopales.

311
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,250
I'll take the bed by the door.

312
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,480
you wearing those little purple panties?

313
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,990
Oh, wait, you can't be wearing
them, because you left them here.

314
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,340
And I have them right in my little hand.

315
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,230
Phone's ringing!

316
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,660
Can't you get it?

317
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,270
I don't think I can. Phone.

318
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,770
Crews, answer the phone.

319
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,420
Reese, I really don't think I can.

320
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:43,330
What is wrong with you? You
can't pick up the phone?Can you--

321
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,060
god, is everything with you something?

322
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:49,410
Is it a zen thing to not
pick up the phone? Hello?

323
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,510
why'd you hang up on me?

324
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,810
I was just asking about your panties.

325
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,960
I didn't hang up on
you.I was just in--

326
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,010
let me call you back.

327
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,060
First of all, I--I just-- I just
wanna say I'm very happy for you.

328
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,110
You're opening
up.You--

329
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:18,820
you seem to be, you know, admitting
love, or-- Or something like love.And--

330
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:23,290
reese, say something. Reese.

331
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,890
I've made up my mind.

332
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,750
I'm taking both beds.

333
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,140
Where am I gonna sleep?

334
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,240
Thank you very much!

335
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,820
Much appreciated.
Hitchhiking is dangerous.

336
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,700
Just say no to drugs. Stay in school!

337
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,960
Deer stew.

338
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,860
You want some?

339
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,940
It's always better a few days later.

340
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,800
I look like a cowboy,don't I?

341
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,890
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.

342
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,430
I always wanted to be an indian.

343
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,160
Damn it.

344
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,600
What are you doing here?

345
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,360
My partner needed some alone time.

346
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,230
Have you come to say good-bye?

347
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,900
I just wanted...

348
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,800
to be close to him for
a little while longer.

349
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:15,000
I know you think that there was
something bad between me and him.

350
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,010
There wasn'T.

351
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,350
He was a good man.

352
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,870
What was there between you?

353
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,810
He found me.

354
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,450
When you ran away?

355
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,090
No,that's when he saved me.

356
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:53,790
That day I ran,I wanted
to find my mother.

357
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,890
I hated it here.

358
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,430
John said he would help me find her,

359
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:02,920
but said that I'd have to learn
how to survive the journey.

360
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:06,680
He taught me to fish,to ride,to shoot.

361
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,360
And so after a while,you
didn't want to leave anymore?

362
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,770
Anna?

363
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:18,890
Do you think tomas could
have killed john hawes?

364
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,680
Anna,did deputy hawes ever
talk to you about...evil?

365
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:36,210
You mean evil with the convertible
mercedes and the pointy red shoes?

366
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,310
Pointy red shoes?

367
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,860
Detective reese?

368
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,110
This is tomas shasta.

369
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,250
What can I do for you,mr. Shasta?

370
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,140
I managed to find your car.

371
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,350
A couple teenagers had
it half way to vegas.

372
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,490
I'm having it brought to the hotel.

373
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:06,370
Seems okay. You might want
to shampoo the rugs,though.

374
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,830
Hello?

375
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,230
evil is a man.

376
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,860
Eval vadas.

377
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,740

Eval,e-v-a-l,vadas.

378
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:32,220
Eval and his brother ziggy were hired by the
tribal council to set up the casino and hotel.

379
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:36,420
He's on the reservation a few days out of
the month,but spends most of his time in L.A.

380
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,600
How is that hotel?

381
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,670
Well,you
know,it's--it's new.

382
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,620
So they're still working out the kinks.

383
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,650
Spacious rooms?

384
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,940
Not too bad.

385
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:51,740
Nice,big bath tubs,with the,uh,air jets?

386
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,520
I didn't get to see the bathroom.

387
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,020
Did you get a haircut?

388
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:02,390
Hawes found out something
about eval vadas and guns.

389
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,530
Okay.

390
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:09,350
Then you two should knock on mr. Eval
vadas's door,and see if hawes was right.

391
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,330
Hey,ted.

392
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,030
Charlie,is everything okay?

393
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,130
Nobody came home last night.

394
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,110
Should have called,sorry.

395
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,510
Reese and I got stuck in the desert.

396
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,750
What do you mean nobody came home?

397
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,020
Ted,where is rachel?

398
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,070
Well,I was hoping she was with you.

399
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,540
Her bed wasn't slept in.

400
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,790
Hello?

401
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,940
Cut it out for a minute.

402
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,780
Rachel,are you okay?

403
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,580
Fine,what's up?

404
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,670
hey,where are you?

405
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,270
Who's that singing?

406
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,210
just a friend.

407
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,320
Put your friend on the phone.

408
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,530
He's busy right now.

409
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,530
Does he know your uncle's a cop?

410
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:59,260
You are not my uncle.

411
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,240
Convertible mercedes.

412
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,530
Hello,police.

413
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,450
Please come in.

414
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,230
We're looking for eval.

415
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,060
Of course.

416
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,210
Eval is waiting for you.

417
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,170
It's just a name,right?

418
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,630
Pointy red shoes.

419
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,560
You're eval.

420
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,400
Thank you for coming so quickly.

421
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:43,960
I hate dialing 9-1-1,but my mother
was so worried that I called.

422
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,380
Oh,your mother
was worried about--

423
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,310
the stalker.

424
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:51,370
Please,let me--
let me show you.

425
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,540
there she is.

426
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:03,260
I have a project on an indian
reservation,and this female tribal officer,

427
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,240
well,she's obsessed with me.

428
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,670
Obsessed?

429
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,250
Yeah,she,uh,she wants
to have eval's babies,so.

430
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:14,040
Ziggy actually thinks it's a
good idea to marry into the tribe.

431
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,150
Why is that?

432
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:19,530
Because then my children would be indians,and they'd
get that big fat check every month from the casinos.

433
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,460
And so you
want us to--

434
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,740
arrest her.

435
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,140
For trespassing.

436
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,860
She's not on your property.

437
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,250
That's the city of
los angeles out there.

438
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,690
I don't need legal advice,thank you.

439
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,060
I need a cop.

440
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,510
Who cares what the reason is?

441
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,720
Ziggy?

442
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,030
Ziggy'll figure this out for you.

443
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,320
You're the brother,ziggy vadas?

444
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,690
Oh,you've heard of us.

445
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,440
Yeah,that was ziggy's idea.

446
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:59,770
She felt that the vadas brothers was a stronger
brand than,you know,vadas siblings,or the two vadases.

447
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,680
Officers,this woman is harassing us.

448
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,840
If you'll go talk to
her,you'll see she wears a gun.

449
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,740
Since she isn't on the reservation,you can
arrest her for carrying an unlicensed firearm.

450
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:11,810
Actually,we're here to talk to
your brother eval about firearms.

451
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,660
You're not the cops we called.

452
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,740
Say good-bye to the
nice policemen,eval.

453
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,400
My brother ziggy.

454
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,410
Usually,we do this in the interrogation
room,but,you know,professional courtesy.

455
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,750
N't put yourself out.

456
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,610
We have you on a
concealed weapons charge.

457
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,760
That is my service weapon.

458
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,840
Not in this city,it isn'T.

459
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,020
John hawes left me a
message about eval and guns.

460
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:42,420
Yeah,we heard that,remember?

461
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,270
Hawes had never called me before.

462
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,980
So it must have been serious.

463
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,750
Guns are serious.

464
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:51,980
If there is a gun problem on my
reservation,then I need to get there first.

465
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,920
Well,captain,it seems you do have
a gun problem on your reservation.

466
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,000
I got those phone dumps
ofdeputy hawes's phone.

467
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,310
He got a call from a gunsmith in corona.

468
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,470
Eval wanted to hire the gunsmith to work on
the reservation full-time converting rifles.

469
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:08,640
as in converting semi-automatic
rifles to fully automatic?

470
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,010
No,he was hoping to
convert them to judaism.

471
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,800
Can you believe it?

472
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,780
Eval has something in his garage.

473
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,510
That door's got
serious locks,and--

474
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,400
he keeps his car in his driveway.

475
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,120
Yes.

476
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,960
Eval,guns,money,dead sheriff.

477
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:25,980
We need a search warrant
for the vadas house.

478
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,640
Dude,the guy's name is eval.

479
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,810
You'll have your warrant in the morning.

480
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,390
You got a couch I can sleep on?

481
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,180
Did you just call me "dude"?

482
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,840
Ted?

483
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,040
Is this curry?

484
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,280
You don't like it? Is it too spicy?

485
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,040
Indian food?

486
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,050
That was a coincidence.

487
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:56,480
I--I just grabbed
the first menu.

488
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,960
How long have you two been together?

489
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,990
Since we met in prison.

490
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,580
but we're not...together.

491
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,280
This isn't your daughter?

492
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,600
No.

493
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,310
She's not my niece.

494
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,210
And there's not a boy not playing the
guitar on the other end of a phone call.

495
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,750
That's exactly right.

496
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,450
There's not.

497
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,400
Look,rachel.

498
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,110
I was worried.

499
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,140
No,he was worried.

500
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,170
You were gone.

501
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,660
I came home,you weren't here.

502
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,610
I called.

503
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,420
You didn't pick up.

504
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,880
I was in the middle of nowhere.

505
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,040
And by that,he means my home.

506
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,330
You can't come and go.

507
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:46,430
I'm in love with olivia.

508
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,430
Charlie.

509
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:54,640
I'm in love with the woman
who's going to marry your father.

510
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,210
White people.

511
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,750
Pass the vindaloo?

512
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:15,880
This is crazy.

513
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:18,130
I'm a business man.

514
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,740
Why are all cops so obsessed with me?

515
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,790
It's just a name,you morons.

516
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,550
That's enough for a militia.

517
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,820
What the hell are those?

518
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,820
The enfield civil war musketoon.

519
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:55,490
Just like it was in 1860,except that these
were made two years ago in south africa.

520
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,310
And...the muzzles have been pluggeD.

521
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,070
but any good gunsmith can bore them out.

522
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,920
And then,you got a
lot of real guns,eval.

523
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,850
Okay.

524
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,790
I have some very high-profile guests
flying in from asia next month.

525
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,720
These guys can go anywhere to gamble,

526
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:13,700
but they're coming to the eagle arrow for
an authentic american indian experience:

527
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,070
The reenactment of custard's last stand.

528
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,110
custer.

529
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,500
Battle of little big horn?

530
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,680
Happened in montana.

531
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,620
I'll be sure to put a
footnote in the brochure.

532
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,770
okay,you were making working guns.

533
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,550
You were importing them illegally,so
you're going to go to jail.

534
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,400
But not with us.

535
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,640
You're goin' federal,sweet pea!

536
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,300
You import these many guns these
days,there's a word for that.

537
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,800
But they're musketoons!

538
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,820
We got a dead sheriff,eval.

539
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,250
I have an alibi for that.

540
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,030
I was with my mother playing bingo.

541
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,880
did hawes ever confront
you about these guns?

542
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,650
Hawes confronted me about everything.

543
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,950
He was always trying to get
the tribal council to fire me.

544
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,060
yeah?

545
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,990
Why's that?

546
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,980
He didn't like that I wasn't an indian.

547
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,480
I mean,who was he to talk?

548
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,530
Okay,let me ask you a question.

549
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,830
How come you didn't just
pay hawes to go away?

550
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,960
I tried.

551
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,230
You don't think I tried?

552
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,560
What happened?

553
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,310
He laughed.

554
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,670
Said I didn't have enough money.

555
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,980
I mean,I would have understood
if he were one of you indians.

556
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,940
I mean,you all won the lottery.

557
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,010
What did he have?

558
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:23,360
Eval didn't do it,but why
didn't hawes take that bribe?

559
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,930
You don't take a bribe
for one of two reasons.

560
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,950
One,because you're an honest cop.

561
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,160
Or two,because someone
made you a better offer.

562
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,640
New york,right?

563
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:35,930
Yeah,but I'm pretty sure
it happens other places too.

564
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,880
The casinos in vegas lose hundreds
of millions each year to the tribeS.

565
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,430
What if they were paying hawes
to try and stop your casino,

566
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,280
and they killed him because he failed?

567
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:48,180
You believe that about hawes?

568
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,640
I never met the deputy.

569
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,260
Didn't know him.

570
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,780
I did.

571
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,440
If you met anna
lakelin,you knew john hawes.

572
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,500
Hawes's financials are clean.

573
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,040
But there's one thing
I can't figure out.

574
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:06,170
A couple weeks ago,he wrote a check to the
chillicothe county courthouse for 60 bucks.

575
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:11,180
Why would a county sheriff's deputy
write a personal check for court records?

576
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,120
Chillicothe?

577
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,950
He do this a lot?

578
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,500
Enough.

579
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,550
Can I ask you?

580
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,390
Did he ever have a head injury?

581
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,250
Deer stew.

582
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,580
Always better a few days later.

583
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,040
How'd you know that?

584
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,060
I...just knew it.

585
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,240
Envelope from chillicothe.

586
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:50,310
They aren't court records
that hawes sent away for.

587
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,850
It's a birth certificate.

588
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,870
For a female born in texas in 1982.

589
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,280
That would be anna's age.

590
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,340
Ballistics came back.

591
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,400
It wasn't your gun that shot hawes.

592
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:08,620
May I have it back now?

593
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,430
Hawes taught you how
to survive the journey?

594
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:15,350
Made you tough?

595
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,980
That's right.

596
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,180
But you weren't done yet.

597
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:22,050
He had one more place
he wanted you to go.

598
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,190
Smoking gun isn't a smoking gun.

599
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:29,090
Smoking gun turns out
to be a piece of paper.

600
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,300
Where was that journey,anna?

601
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:37,000
Was it really to find your mother?

602
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,500
No.

603
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,880
It was to find me.

604
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,510
Let me see that.

605
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,350
Tomas,I didn't know.

606
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,850
What is it?

607
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:04,940
What has he shown you?

608
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:08,400
Deputy hawes made good on his
promise to find anna's mother.

609
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:12,490
Hawes was a sad man who
never had a child of his own.

610
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,510
No.

611
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,560
Hawes never had a child,but you did.

612
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,140
You and your wife,you had anna.

613
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,240
Got a birth certificate to prove it.

614
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,660
Got a birth certificate to
prove something else too,loomis.

615
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:32,350
I'm not-- I never-- I'm
not a native american.

616
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,020
not by blood.

617
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,600
Loomis,you lied when you
came on the reservation.

618
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,320
No one was checking.

619
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,700
No one cared.

620
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,070
The casino money wasn't coming in.

621
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:44,310
I'm sorry,anna.

622
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,910
Tomas.

623
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,220
Say something.

624
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,010
Found some dried blood
in your truck,mr. Lakelin.

625
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:02,050
Pretty sure tests will show
us it belongs to john hawes.

626
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,820
You have a gun yourself,don't you,sir?

627
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:08,120
hawes comes to you with this so you can
have a chance to make right by your daughter.

628
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,030
He went out without his gun that
night,expected to find a friend.

629
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:17,370
John always told me to keep
one in my pocket,just in case.

630
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,500
You killed him for the money?

631
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,150
The casino money?

632
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,220
I did it for you.

633
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,550
Do you think tomas would
marry you if he knew?

634
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,890
anna marries me.

635
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:33,450
Then your money and
land is protected too?

636
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,810
anna.

637
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,060
Is this what deputy john
hawes would have done?

638
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:40,530
Yes,it is.

639
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,980
Okay.

640
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,890
Okay.

641
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:48,100
Is this what deputy john hawes
would have wanted you to do?

642
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,070
anna, ***

643
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,760
you are leaving sovereign tribal land.
you are now entering u.s.territory

644
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,110
Okay,you can open them.

645
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:39,020
Now,I want you to take a good,long look.

646
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,200
I'm doing that.

647
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,400
And I want you to think about this next
time you feel like calling me "dude."

648
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,490
Understood.

649
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,780
You were jealous I was
in that room with crews.

650
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,350
No way.

651
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,270
Yeah,you were.

652
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,340
I wasn't jealous.

653
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:57,590
Come on,admit it.

654
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,740
Admit it.

655
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:02,860
Dude,I wasn't jealous.

656
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,600

Dani,no,I'm--

657
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,470
reese.

658
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,620
Idiot.

659
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,720
Idiot.

660
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,420
Detective crews.

661
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,400
Oh,mr. Rayborn.

662
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,910
It's a nice night,isn't it?

663
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,850
Yes,it is.

664
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,170
I got the world on a string up here.

665
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,070
Mayor over there,senator at that table.

666
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,570
Movie stars,rock stars.

667
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,340
This is the party I
grew up wanting to go to.

668
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,990
And you know what?

669
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,380
Now that you're at the
party,you want to go home.

670
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,650
Yes.

671
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:07,790
The sad fact is,though,that I am home.

672
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:11,010
Not many people in our club,detective.

673
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,540
What club is that?

674
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,300
Cops with money.

675
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,440
Cops with lots and lots of money.

676
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:19,130
Might just be the two of us.

677
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:23,360
I saw a photo once.

678
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,090
Makes me think there
might be a few more.

679
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:30,580
Can I tell you a secret?

680
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,970
Something no one else knows?

681
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,140
No one.

682
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,510
Why would you want to
tell me your secret?

683
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,440
I got my test back today.

684
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,330
Something real bad going on in my cells.

685
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:45,010
I've got six months on the outside.

686
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,750
But that's not the secret.

687
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,460
What is?

688
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:55,460
The secret is there's some
things I need to do before I go.

689
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:59,560
Here we go,detective crews.

690
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,120
