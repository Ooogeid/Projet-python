1
00:00:04,396 --> 00:00:05,196
Crews.

2
00:00:06,202 --> 00:00:07,352
Come in here.

3
00:00:09,146 --> 00:00:12,246
- You need something?
- Yeah, I do. Close the door.

4
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:16,521
Get the blinds.

5
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:19,143
The blinds, yeah.
Close all the blinds.

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,527
I need you to stomp on my foot.

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,285
- You need me to stomp on your foot?
- Yeah. It's asleep.

8
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,661
- My foot's asleep.
- Asleep?

9
00:00:34,786 --> 00:00:37,160
Hate it when that happens.
It'll be awake all night now.

10
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,288
Are you gonna stomp
on my foot or not?

11
00:00:46,184 --> 00:00:48,381
Come on.
Give it more than that.

12
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,430
- Anything?
- Nothing. Take it up a notch.

13
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,725
My second wife,
she was really good at this.

14
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,351
Must have been something
about her shoes.

15
00:01:01,476 --> 00:01:04,276
- What about Reese?
- I'm bringing her along.

16
00:01:05,992 --> 00:01:07,099
Got a tingle.

17
00:01:07,224 --> 00:01:08,324
Do it again.

18
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:13,411
Now I'm feeling it.
One more time.

19
00:01:14,145 --> 00:01:16,632
Ah, yeah!
There it is. Yeah.

20
00:01:21,608 --> 00:01:22,683
There's a

21
00:01:22,807 --> 00:01:24,326
dead guy at the

22
00:01:24,938 --> 00:01:26,264
beach.

23
00:01:27,773 --> 00:01:28,723
Dead guy.

24
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:35,653
- What was...
- Don't ask.

25
00:01:36,367 --> 00:01:40,317
- Do all detectives have to do that?
- Bobby, let's go to the beach.

26
00:01:58,622 --> 00:02:00,172
Anybody see anything?

27
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:02,301
Runner, he was coming through
the crowd.

28
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:03,976
Then he just dropped.

29
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:06,196
Big blade, hmm.

30
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:07,789
Buck knife?

31
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:10,296
Looks serrated.

32
00:02:11,116 --> 00:02:13,236
He just dropped?
Stabbed through the heart.

33
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:15,378
- Turned him off like a light.
- Robbery gone wrong?

34
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,678
Shove a victim,
slit his pockets, knife slips.

35
00:02:18,214 --> 00:02:20,414
Well, he's got no pockets to slit.

36
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:21,854
No pockets.

37
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:23,101
So,

38
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:24,435
no I.D.

39
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,923
You go out for a run,
you lock the door, right?

40
00:02:27,048 --> 00:02:28,298
Don't run much.

41
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:29,801
That much.

42
00:02:29,927 --> 00:02:31,173
No pockets.

43
00:02:31,553 --> 00:02:34,253
You lock the door,
where do you put the key?

44
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:45,596
The Sea Sprite.
Ocean front motel.

45
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:53,501
Out-of-towners love this zoo.

46
00:02:54,305 --> 00:02:55,755
What's not to love?

47
00:02:56,295 --> 00:02:58,245
Clearly you are not a parent.

48
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:30,084
Out-of-towners on vacation.

49
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:32,667
Not on vacation. On leave.

50
00:03:35,502 --> 00:03:36,298
Army.

51
00:03:37,568 --> 00:03:39,568
If our dead guy is one of 'em,

52
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:42,229
that leaves three more.

53
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,349
Oh.

54
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,395
One of 'em's a real little guy.

55
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,063
Or not a guy at all.

56
00:04:00,827 --> 00:04:01,608
What?

57
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,785
Can I help you with something?

58
00:04:06,134 --> 00:04:08,956
Those are nice sunglasses.
You get those on the beach.

59
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,993
You get a lot of sunglasses
on the beach. It's sunny there.

60
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,616
I'm gonna ask you again.

61
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:15,921
Can I help you with something?

62
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,249
Well, you can start by telling
your two friends behind us

63
00:04:18,374 --> 00:04:21,552
to put their hands in the air
and get down on their knees.

64

66
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:39,445
Dixon Sims, Andy Stiller,
Erin Cordett.

67
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,303
All active duty U.S. Army.

68
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:43,803
Back from Iraq.
In L.A. On leave.

69
00:04:43,928 --> 00:04:46,178
- And the victim?
- Travis Slocum.

70
00:04:46,602 --> 00:04:49,902
They all surf together
and they all came here together.

71
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:53,303
I only count three beds.
All four staying in this room?

72
00:04:53,428 --> 00:04:55,921
Said they could only afford
the one room, so they rotated,

73
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,304
taking turns on the floor.

74
00:04:57,429 --> 00:05:00,098
What about that diversion attack
they pulled on you two?

75
00:05:00,223 --> 00:05:02,760
Said they saw strangers in their room.
Training just kicked in.

76
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,262
I don't mean to sound unpatriotic,
but I see

77
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,060
a cute girl sharing a room with three
boys and now one of the boys is dead.

78
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:11,115
Well, they all alibi each other.

79
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,190
Said they were all hanging at the pool
while Slocum went for his run.

80
00:05:16,468 --> 00:05:17,218
What?

81
00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:21,022
- What?
- It's just...

82
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:24,962
- Reese told me to...
- Reese told you to what, captain?

83
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:28,410
Reese told me to make sure
I always ask you what you see.

84
00:05:29,554 --> 00:05:31,404
Ah, she said that, did she?

85
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:33,576
So?

86
00:05:34,804 --> 00:05:36,104
What do you see?

87
00:05:36,656 --> 00:05:38,756
Actually, it's what I don't see.

88
00:05:41,619 --> 00:05:43,342
She said he might say that.

89
00:05:49,671 --> 00:05:51,571
You're not wearing dog tags?

90
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:57,044
You're all still on active duty, right?
How come you took off your tags?

91
00:05:57,391 --> 00:06:00,526
When a policeman takes off his badge,
in my experience,

92
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,741
it usually means he's up to no good.

93
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:03,990
I see those tags.

94
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:06,493
Took 'em off because we're not
over there just now.

95
00:06:06,618 --> 00:06:09,159
Because we just wanted to be here
for two weeks.

96
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,828
Operation: fun and sun.

97
00:06:10,991 --> 00:06:13,191
Wouldn't expect you to understand.

98
00:06:15,036 --> 00:06:15,786
Okay.

99
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:17,093
Listen.

100
00:06:17,475 --> 00:06:18,925
My captain out there...

101
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,679
He sees a pretty girl
and you fellas in this room,

102
00:06:21,803 --> 00:06:23,482
he's thinking jealousy.

103
00:06:23,607 --> 00:06:24,707
Not robbery.

104
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:28,254
Travis and us?

105
00:06:28,686 --> 00:06:30,036
We surf together.

106
00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:31,807
Kick major ass together.

107
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,767
Wouldn't expect you to understand.

108
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:35,769
You don't expect a lot, do you?

109
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,985
I get what I get,
and I don't get upset, sir.

110
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:46,866
Travis Slocum.

111
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:49,385
We're gonna have
to take this with us.

112
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,866
I'll make sure these get
where they need to go.

113
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:53,120
It's okay, Andy.

114
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,748
Detective Crews
will be respectful with that.

115
00:06:57,971 --> 00:06:59,201
Won't you, sir?

116
00:07:04,697 --> 00:07:06,241
They're all from the midwest.

117
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:08,115
They all saw heavy action in Iraq.

118
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,906
This, however, is their first time

119
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,251
in L.A.

120
00:07:16,117 --> 00:07:17,317
Dirty clothes.

121
00:07:18,117 --> 00:07:20,245
Dirty clothes, dirty clothes.

122
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:25,407
A souvenir glass with the letters
"a. F.O." Stenciled on it.

123
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,804
Does not mean "Air Force One."

124
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:30,347
We should find out
where this came from.

125
00:07:30,472 --> 00:07:32,210
Where there's drinking,
there's arguments.

126
00:07:32,335 --> 00:07:33,706
Arguments, there's violence.

127
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:37,773
Got a lightweight protective vest in

128
00:07:37,897 --> 00:07:39,075
good condition.

129
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,250
Very light.

130
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:41,866
And...

131
00:07:42,506 --> 00:07:43,504
And what?

132
00:07:43,866 --> 00:07:46,491
A medal for exceptional valor.

133
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:48,075
Sadr city, Iraq,

134
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:51,178
april 12, 2008.
Victim was a hero.

135
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,138
And tidwell thinks
it's about the girl?

136
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,325
In the united states
of new york city,

137
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:58,102
where there's a dead guy,
there's a girl there somewhere.

138
00:07:58,884 --> 00:08:00,938
- Well, what do you think?
- Well, I think

139
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,749
you put a knife
into Slocum's heart like that,

140
00:08:03,873 --> 00:08:05,352
you need traing

141
00:08:05,476 --> 00:08:08,129
to get that close
without being seen, or

142
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,531
- he needs to know you, so...
- So you can get that close

143
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,499
without causing any alarm.

144
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:16,429
- And travis' buddies...
- Knew him and had the training.

145
00:08:16,554 --> 00:08:17,604
Hey, Reese.

146
00:08:18,176 --> 00:08:20,944
Reese, you said something nice
about me to Tidwell, huh?

147
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:22,024
No, I didn't.

148
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:25,699
You know, Reese. With distance,
you're appreciating me more.

149
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,880
Reese?

150
00:08:29,462 --> 00:08:30,262
Reese?

151
00:08:30,907 --> 00:08:32,144
Well, that's just rude.

152
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,555
You know she's not here, right?

153
00:08:35,742 --> 00:08:36,931
You get the video?

154
00:08:37,056 --> 00:08:38,906
Yeah.
It should be up now.

155
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:44,740
You can't see Reese here
in this room, can you?

156
00:08:44,865 --> 00:08:47,115
I mean, is she...
Is she here now?

157
00:08:53,238 --> 00:08:56,938
So many people. Can't tell
who got close to him and who didn't.

158
00:09:02,284 --> 00:09:04,056
Nobody saw him get stabbed.

159
00:09:04,181 --> 00:09:06,531
Nobody even noticed him
till he fell.

160
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,083
Nobody saw anything.
I showed these pictures to everybody.

161
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,716
I even talked to the human statue.

162
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:14,541
- Oh, yeah? What'd he say?
- It was a girl.

163
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:17,243
Said she didn't really look at
the faces staring at her.

164
00:09:17,368 --> 00:09:20,534
- What's she looking at?
- Watching films in her head.

165
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:21,833
Godfather III today.

166
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,660
- Isn't that the worst one?
- Yeah.

167
00:09:23,785 --> 00:09:27,685
Since she watched the other two,
she likes to finish things, and...

168
00:09:28,345 --> 00:09:30,545
Slocum runs into this crowd alive,

169
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:33,397
and he comes out dead.

170
00:09:33,784 --> 00:09:35,884
How do you kill a guy like that?

171
00:09:36,957 --> 00:09:37,701
Okay.

172
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:38,919
I'm Slocum.

173
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,944
I'm jogging this way.

174
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:43,451
What... I just come up,
stick you in the chest?

175
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:45,137
Battle-tested soldier?

176
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,729
Doesn't seem right.

177
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:23,299
You don't see Reese again, do you?

178
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:24,917
Is she here now, Charlie?

179
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,195
How do you kill a guy like that?

180
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,384
He's been stabbed by...
Here, maybe, two, three seconds.

181
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:36,935
Wind it back.

182
00:10:39,736 --> 00:10:42,908
- You can't see him now.
- We're not looking for him.

183
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:46,554
He gets stabbed right about... now.

184
00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:49,557
There. Look at that.

185
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:50,983
See the musician here?

186
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,901
She's turning up her amp.

187
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,736
This vendor spills his ice.
And these two guys here

188
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,010
at the table,

189
00:10:57,177 --> 00:11:00,327
they start pushing each other.
All at the same time.

190
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,374
He said it was performance art.

191
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,460
- He asked you to argue?
- When we got a text, we started.

192
00:11:10,826 --> 00:11:11,733
Same with you?

193
00:11:11,858 --> 00:11:14,183
Yeah, he did.
He said it was performance art.

194
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:15,608
He gave me $100.

195
00:11:15,931 --> 00:11:17,131
Paid you, too?

196
00:11:18,431 --> 00:11:19,511
What'd he look like?

197
00:11:19,682 --> 00:11:21,930
White guy, sunglasses, hoodie.

198
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:25,511
Could be.

199
00:11:25,636 --> 00:11:27,978
But, uh, like he said,
he had a hoodie and sunglasses.

200
00:11:28,348 --> 00:11:30,897
- You rember anything else?
- Yeah, he was a tough sale.

201
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:32,870
You tried to sell him something?

202
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:34,245
Big bad bertha.

203
00:11:34,683 --> 00:11:37,446
Since he had all that money.
But I couldn't get him to buy it.

204
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:39,658
- You get him to touch it?
- I did.

205
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,244
Always put the merchandise
in their hands.

206
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,535
First rule of sales.

207
00:11:44,647 --> 00:11:46,478
You want to get that dusted
for prints?

208
00:11:46,603 --> 00:11:47,353
I do.

209
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:49,967
A diversion.

210
00:11:50,995 --> 00:11:52,616
Get Slocum's attention going one way,

211
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,161
Then push that knife right in his heart
and no one sees it.

212
00:11:55,286 --> 00:11:56,486
Or the killer.

213
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,220
We've seen a diversion before,
haven't we?

214
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:04,369
Let's try this again.

215
00:12:04,494 --> 00:12:05,932
Do you know this man?

216
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:06,757
Yes.

217
00:12:07,273 --> 00:12:08,352
You know his name?

218
00:12:09,055 --> 00:12:11,808
- Mickey Rayborn.
- How do you know Mickey Rayborn?

219
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:13,449
I've seen him in the papers.

220
00:12:13,574 --> 00:12:15,369
- The stories about his murder?
- Yes.

221
00:12:15,494 --> 00:12:18,769
Do you know him in any other way
besides the stories in the paper?

222
00:12:18,894 --> 00:12:19,731
Yes.

223
00:12:20,056 --> 00:12:22,743
In what other way do you know
Mickey Rayborn?

224
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:25,327
He was some kind of famous cop
before I got on the force.

225
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,459
Do you know Mickey Rayborn
in any other way

226
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,433
besides for him being some kind
of famous cop?

227
00:12:35,682 --> 00:12:38,170
- Yes.
- In what way would that be?

228
00:12:40,433 --> 00:12:42,679
Detective, your answers
will not be used against you.

229
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,431
The bureau needs to know
your secrets so no one...

230
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:45,983
Will use them against me.

231
00:12:46,108 --> 00:12:47,766
- That's right.
- Yeah.

232
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,984
In what other way do you know
Mickey Rayborn, then?

233
00:12:52,056 --> 00:12:53,605
He and my father were friends.

234
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,760
They were both cops?

235
00:12:56,307 --> 00:12:57,125
Yes.

236
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,200
And where is your father now?

237
00:12:59,871 --> 00:13:01,332
I don't know.
He took off.

238
00:13:01,457 --> 00:13:03,729
There is a detail left out of
the newspaper articles

239
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:05,075
about Rayborn's death.

240
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,270
Do you know what it is?

241
00:13:07,869 --> 00:13:08,618
No.

242
00:13:08,743 --> 00:13:10,493
His body was never found.

243
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,580
As a detective,
what's that mean to you?

244
00:13:15,022 --> 00:13:17,572
All that blood
in the water nearby, um...

245
00:13:17,934 --> 00:13:19,682
I'm guessing he was butchered.

246
00:13:19,807 --> 00:13:20,807
Butchered.

247
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,762
Do you know this man?

248
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,270
Damn it, I can't do it.

249
00:13:42,494 --> 00:13:44,794
- Watch movies in your head?
- Mmm.

250
00:13:45,293 --> 00:13:46,621
Takes practice.

251
00:13:46,746 --> 00:13:48,796
I used to be really good at it.

252
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:51,259
- When you were inside?
- Mm-hmm.

253
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:53,895
- Godfather III?
- No.

254
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:55,792
Home movies.

255
00:13:56,472 --> 00:13:58,370
I'm guessing that must have hurt.

256
00:13:58,495 --> 00:14:00,895
I'm guessing that's why I watched 'em.

257
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:04,433
Take a look at that.

258
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:10,140
Where is she going dressed like that?

259
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:27,766
Why'd they take their dog tags off?

260
00:14:42,417 --> 00:14:44,216
That's, like, a giant private jet.

261
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,308
Come on.
Let's follow her.

262
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:52,498
Don't have a warrant or a ticket.

263
00:14:52,623 --> 00:14:55,473
Come on, the door's open.
We can just walk on.

264
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:58,247
That plane, you don't need a ticket
if you look like you have a ticket.

265
00:14:58,372 --> 00:15:01,601
No, Charlie, you don't need a ticket
because you look like you have a ticket.

266
00:15:01,726 --> 00:15:03,568
Me?
I need a ticket.

267
00:15:04,575 --> 00:15:05,325
Okay.

268
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:11,407
Keep your phone on.
I'll call you when I land.

269
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:14,581
Jerry, that number's a joke.

270
00:15:15,183 --> 00:15:17,408
Jerry, that number's so small
I can't even see it.

271
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:19,422
Wait, wait, do I see it?

272
00:15:19,736 --> 00:15:22,958
No. It's too small.
False alarm. Bye, jerry.

273
00:15:24,182 --> 00:15:24,982
Jerry.

274
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:26,726
Cell phone.

275
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,094
Cell phone, sir.

276
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,559
Thank you.

277
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:42,440
Welcome to air fun one.

278
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,683
- A. f. O.
- Is there anything else you'd like?

279
00:15:45,808 --> 00:15:48,840
Well, if it's a specific question,
I don't need anything,

280
00:15:48,965 --> 00:15:50,551
but if it's a more general question...

281
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:51,683
Excuse me.

282
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:55,243
Sometimes I think
I don't need anything, but I do.

283
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:56,918
I just don't know it.

284
00:15:59,311 --> 00:16:01,111
Well, is this what I need?

285
00:16:01,796 --> 00:16:04,558
I need you off this plane.
You're not supposed to be here.

286
00:16:04,683 --> 00:16:08,297
You're not supposed to be here, either.
Why'd you take your dog tags off, Erin?

287
00:16:08,506 --> 00:16:10,635
You know why.
I'm working security.

288
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,013
- Which is against army regs.
- I need the money.

289
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:15,309
I've been making
less than minimum wage for two years.

290
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,184
A lot less.
We all have.

291
00:16:17,452 --> 00:16:19,183
Everyone?
You've got to be seated.

292
00:16:19,308 --> 00:16:22,746
Uh, one moment please.
I'm just having some trouble with my...

293
00:16:22,871 --> 00:16:23,815
Fastener.

294
00:16:25,907 --> 00:16:27,234
I... okay. Listen.

295
00:16:27,648 --> 00:16:29,135
Travis was working this plane.

296
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,706
You're working this plane.

297
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:33,558
Anything you think I should know
about what happens on this plane?

298
00:16:33,683 --> 00:16:36,018
The service called me this morning.
They thought travis flaked.

299
00:16:36,143 --> 00:16:38,538
I didn't say what happened to him.
It's none of their business.

300
00:16:38,945 --> 00:16:40,006
I need the money.

301
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:41,210
That's why we came.

302
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:42,985
But now travis is dead.

303
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:43,934
Yeah.

304
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:45,309
Travis is dead.

305
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:47,371
But I still need the money.

306
00:16:47,496 --> 00:16:49,546
Erin, where's this plane going?

307
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:51,684
It doesn't really go anywhere.

308
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:55,409
So it's just a flying party
where people get contracts signed?

309
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,502
Why'd they take our phones?

310
00:16:57,627 --> 00:17:00,177
Because they all have cameras
in 'em now.

311
00:17:03,371 --> 00:17:05,371
You can sit there for takeoff.

312
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,467
What if I don't know the way
I want what I want?

313
00:17:50,592 --> 00:17:52,184
You don't know what you want.

314
00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:54,559
Maybe I can help you figure it out.

315
00:17:55,997 --> 00:17:57,123
Gus Wilvern.

316
00:17:57,248 --> 00:17:58,284
Chemxtech.

317
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,936
Vice president, customer relations.
And you are?

318
00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:03,655
Really, really enjoying this plane.

319
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,872
Well, you'd have a disorder
if you weren't.

320
00:18:05,997 --> 00:18:07,961
- And your name is?
- Charlie Crews.

321
00:18:08,997 --> 00:18:11,423
- That Charlie Crews?
- No, this Charlie Crews.

322
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,489
Eh, falsely-accused Charlie Crews.

323
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:15,427
No, detective Charlie Crews.

324
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:20,024
- You look a lot different in person.
- I am a lot different in person.

325
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:22,899
A lot different in person.
That's excellent.

326
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,390
I gotta ask you, though,

327
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,806
- who'd you come on board with?
- Oh, just me.

328
00:18:28,931 --> 00:18:31,731
And this murder investigation
I got going on.

329
00:18:37,536 --> 00:18:39,499
Slocum worked security for you.

330
00:18:39,624 --> 00:18:41,874
Temp.
Didn't show up this morning.

331
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,123
Our Slocum.
Murdered.

332
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,798
Here, after everything
he'd been through.

333
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,730
Maybe you wanna go easy.

334
00:18:50,855 --> 00:18:52,405
Just one more bottle.

335
00:18:52,721 --> 00:18:55,271
They're very tiny.
We have the big ones.

336
00:18:56,394 --> 00:18:58,146
People seem to prefer the little ones.

337
00:18:58,271 --> 00:18:59,971
Just nostalgia, I guess.

338
00:19:01,811 --> 00:19:03,174
Why did travis work here?

339
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:05,434
Oh, these kids...
They get paid nothing on active duty.

340
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:07,815
I try and help 'em out
when they're on leave.

341
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,100
- Between me and them.
- So you pay 'em under the table?

342
00:19:10,225 --> 00:19:12,425
They're not supposed to moonlight.

343
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,152
- It's better for 'em.
- And you.

344
00:19:14,977 --> 00:19:17,544
Anything that happens up here.
They can't talk about, can they?

345
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:19,415
- What would happen up here?
- Gus,

346
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,292
you've got grown men up here
walking around

347
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:22,909
dressed up as cowboys and gladiators.

348
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,684
Some guys like to fly around
and play poker.

349
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:26,431
Some guys like to fly around
and play dress up.

350
00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:28,123
I don't judge.
It's easier that way.

351
00:19:28,248 --> 00:19:30,627
Any guys like to fly around
and play rough?

352
00:19:33,186 --> 00:19:37,061
Travis Slocum see something happen up
here that wasn't poker or dress up?

353
00:19:37,186 --> 00:19:39,384
Something he just couldn't keep
quiet about?

354
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,508
Are you implying I'm trying
to get away with something?

355
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:44,349
Not implying, Gus.
You are getting away with something.

356
00:19:46,498 --> 00:19:48,896
You, uh, clearly don't understand

357
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,500
chemxtech's relationship
with the troops, detective.

358
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:54,809
We have programs providing housing
for vets who are homeless...

359
00:19:54,934 --> 00:19:56,236
All kinds of outreach.

360
00:19:56,811 --> 00:19:58,822
How did you reach out to Slocum?

361
00:19:59,852 --> 00:20:00,602
Okay.

362
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,214
Let me give you a number.
Protectanddefendurself.com.

363
00:20:09,771 --> 00:20:10,571
Twice?

364
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,911
To go to prison twice?

365
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,310
Just lucky, I guess.

366
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,760
You have such a positive attitude.

367
00:20:21,115 --> 00:20:23,307
The second time wasn't
for very long, was it?

368
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:26,470
- Not very long, no.
- I don't know about these things,

369
00:20:26,594 --> 00:20:28,750
but is it normal to go in
and out of jail so quickly?

370
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,563
Prison. Not jail.
Prison.

371
00:20:34,122 --> 00:20:37,026
- And you know what I learned there?
- Do tell.

372
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:41,406
I learned that i'm not this charming.

373
00:20:42,438 --> 00:20:44,993
- I'm sorry, "this charming"?
- This.

374
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,587
Your smile.

375
00:20:46,935 --> 00:20:47,935
Your laugh.

376
00:20:51,132 --> 00:20:53,690
He's not this charming, believe me.

377
00:20:56,248 --> 00:20:58,756
- You think this is a joke.
- You gotta laugh.

378
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,701
Are you finished with these?

379
00:21:09,758 --> 00:21:11,623
- Now what?
- We laugh.

380
00:21:11,748 --> 00:21:12,748
But first...

381
00:21:13,685 --> 00:21:15,435
I gotta get back to work.

382
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:19,274
I got Bobby in the car.

383
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:26,875
Tidwell called.

384
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,260
I'm back in uniform tomorrow.

385
00:21:31,602 --> 00:21:34,005
- He say Reese was coming back?
- No.

386
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:36,750
Got you some detective
from Valley division.

387
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,312
Didn't get a name.

388
00:21:38,437 --> 00:21:40,187
So this is your last day?

389
00:21:43,233 --> 00:21:45,094
Let's go catch us a killer, then.

390
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:49,478
What have you got, fries in there?

391
00:21:54,515 --> 00:21:56,814
Pete Magnus.
Gus Wilvern gave us your number.

392
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,070
Protect and defend urself, inc.

393
00:21:59,873 --> 00:22:01,876
- Who wants to know?
- L.A.P.D.

394
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:04,312
- How'd you get in my perimeter?
- Your mom.

395
00:22:04,437 --> 00:22:05,637
Real friendly.

396
00:22:06,062 --> 00:22:08,212
Let us right into your perimeter.

397
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:09,662
Nice knives.

398
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,747
- You have no right to be here.
- You know how to use 'em?

399
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,752
I run an internet-based business.

400
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:16,786
You get security work
for troops on leave.

401
00:22:16,911 --> 00:22:18,999
Everything I know is out of
your realm of authority.

402
00:22:19,124 --> 00:22:22,006
Travis Slocum isn't out of
our realm of authority.

403
00:22:25,249 --> 00:22:27,373
Well, Slocum made enemies.

404
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,624
He slipped up.
Should've known.

405
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,980
A military man must be
on guard at all times.

406
00:22:33,105 --> 00:22:35,125
And I do mean all times.

407
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:39,463
Travis Slocum was military.
You're not exactly military.

408
00:22:39,588 --> 00:22:41,023
He give you a hard time?

409
00:22:41,148 --> 00:22:44,848
Slocum said the moron who kicked
my army application was right.

410
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,614
I say bad judgment on his part,

411
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,826
bad judgment on theirs,
bad judgment breeds bad results.

412
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:52,702
I was never giving Slocum
another referral.

413
00:22:52,917 --> 00:22:54,998
You don't get out of this room much,
do you, Pete?

414
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:57,459
Flatfoot, you'd get your ass fragged
in two seconds

415
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:00,169
you ever saw any real action.
Fraggedy-ass.

416
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:02,922
You know Erin Cordett?

417
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:06,217
She sent me a text saying Slocum
was sick, could she take his job.

418
00:23:06,936 --> 00:23:09,345
- She sent you a text?
- What a vulture.

419
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,348
Why would she be acceptable
to the army and not me, huh?

420
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:13,999
You want to show us that text?

421
00:23:14,124 --> 00:23:16,102
Or should we make it
our realm of authority?

422
00:23:24,725 --> 00:23:26,475
Where were you yesterday?

423
00:23:27,397 --> 00:23:28,508
I was here.

424
00:23:28,633 --> 00:23:30,200
Earning my wages.

425
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:33,959
You may query my mother
on that if you wish.

426
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,500
Erin lied to you about
how she got on that plane.

427
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,543
Yeah, she went after
travis Slocum's job.

428
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,800
Crews.

429
00:23:43,187 --> 00:23:43,937
Okay.

430
00:23:44,874 --> 00:23:46,432
Got prints off of that bong.

431
00:23:46,557 --> 00:23:48,307
We going back to the mel?

432
00:23:53,611 --> 00:23:54,861
Quentin Norris?

433
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,750
This is the police.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

434
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,206
Quentin Norris, open up.

435
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,687
My god.

436
00:24:40,865 --> 00:24:42,735
Hoodie, sunglasses...

437
00:24:53,022 --> 00:24:54,272
Quentin Norris.

438
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:59,612
Find a lot of dead junkies
in the shower.

439
00:24:59,737 --> 00:25:01,224
Something to do with
wanting to get clean?

440
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:02,311
Maybe.

441
00:25:04,729 --> 00:25:06,212
Well, hello, there.

442
00:25:07,747 --> 00:25:08,997
They're grapes.

443
00:25:09,206 --> 00:25:11,156
Yeah, but what kind of grape?

444
00:25:11,308 --> 00:25:12,552
They're not red flame

445
00:25:12,676 --> 00:25:13,731
or thompson or

446
00:25:13,855 --> 00:25:15,654
concord or muscadine.

447
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:18,712
It's like all of 'em...

448
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,052
Perfect.

449
00:25:20,177 --> 00:25:21,686
- Too perfect?
- And evidence.

450
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:24,654
Like all this other crapola.
So put 'em back.

451
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,496
Well, it's juicy.

452
00:25:28,621 --> 00:25:30,811
- It's crisp. It's...
- A grape?

453
00:25:31,435 --> 00:25:33,385
No, I... I don't think it is.

454
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:35,254
So what is it then?

455
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:37,179
Grape-y.

456
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:38,911
Grape-ish.

457
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,147
Yo, Charlie.

458
00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:43,639
Check this out.

459
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:46,186
New bills.

460
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,503
All rolled together.

461
00:25:48,123 --> 00:25:52,323
Junkie in the shower didn't look like
the kind of guy to cash a paycheck.

462
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,634
Bobby.

463
00:25:54,123 --> 00:25:55,558
Check this out.

464
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:05,058
Got blood on the blade
that matches our victim Slocum

465
00:26:05,182 --> 00:26:07,256
and ten grand in a potato chip can.

466
00:26:07,381 --> 00:26:09,817
Norris was spreading some of that
money around before the killing.

467
00:26:09,942 --> 00:26:12,195
- And Norris was military, too?
- Before our guys.

468
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:14,497
Desert storm.
In the'90s.

469
00:26:14,622 --> 00:26:16,873
Dishonorable discharge
ten years ago.

470
00:26:16,998 --> 00:26:19,952
History of assault, burglary...
All drug-related.

471
00:26:20,371 --> 00:26:22,321
One combat vet kills another.

472
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,769
Everything connected, Crews?

473
00:26:25,348 --> 00:26:27,698
Ah, you do miss me,
don't you, Reese?

474
00:26:28,812 --> 00:26:30,437
How's the F.B.I. treating you?

475
00:26:30,985 --> 00:26:33,174
Uh, so far, just security clearance.

476
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:36,449
Oh, The lie detector, huh?
Do you want to know how to beat that?

477
00:26:36,574 --> 00:26:39,057
- You can beat a lie detector?
- Sure, it's easy.

478
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:40,882
You just tell the truth.

479
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:44,986
Reese?

480
00:26:45,998 --> 00:26:46,798
Reese?

481
00:26:50,373 --> 00:26:51,923
Tox screen came back.

482
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:53,961
The dead junkie...

483
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,280
His smack was cut
with drain cleaner.

484
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,950
So someone paid Norris
to kill Slocum,

485
00:27:00,275 --> 00:27:01,619
then someone killed Norris.

486
00:27:06,105 --> 00:27:07,625
She was on the phone.

487
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:27,622
Stuff I've seen, this doesn't look like
a bad way to go.

488
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:30,398
- Friend of yours?
- Pretty sure he killed travis.

489
00:27:31,324 --> 00:27:33,224
I guess dreams do come true.

490
00:27:33,374 --> 00:27:35,267
I was hoping for a sucking
chest wound, though.

491
00:27:35,465 --> 00:27:36,961
Not drain cleaner?

492
00:27:37,634 --> 00:27:39,740
Somebody spiked his needle.
It wasn't you, was it?

493
00:27:41,998 --> 00:27:44,498
- You'd have shot him.
- Sir, yes, sir.

494
00:27:44,685 --> 00:27:48,084
Thing is, Erin,
"sir, yes, sirs" aside,

495
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,908
turns out you're a liar.

496
00:27:50,061 --> 00:27:53,397
First you tell us that you're here
for sun and fun, but you're working

497
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:57,811
then you tell us the agency called
to take travis' job but you called them.

498
00:27:57,936 --> 00:27:59,186
Okay, I called.

499
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:01,378
Chemxtech pays best.

500
00:28:02,225 --> 00:28:04,184
You know how to beat
a lie detector, Erin?

501
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:05,999
Yeah, you tell the truth.

502
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:10,021
Where were you last night
when Norris here got his hot shot?

503
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,313
In a bar.

504
00:28:11,901 --> 00:28:12,982
What bar?

505
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,950
We went to a bunch of 'em.

506
00:28:18,966 --> 00:28:20,060
All together?

507
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:23,784
That's right. All together.
That's how we do it.

508
00:28:24,642 --> 00:28:27,107
And it was just cash that made
you want to get on that plane?

509
00:28:27,191 --> 00:28:28,063
That's right.

510
00:28:28,147 --> 00:28:30,843
And it was just cash that made travis
Want to get on that plane?

511
00:28:30,968 --> 00:28:32,043
That's right.

512
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:34,795
'cause you see, Erin,
we got two dead soldiers.

513
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,881
Got lots of dead soldiers.

514
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,884
Yeah. But I'm gonna find out
why these two died.

515
00:28:40,596 --> 00:28:43,031
Well, that's where we're different,
detective Crews.

516
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:45,106
We're trained not to ask why.

517
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:47,269
Just gets in the way.

518
00:28:54,628 --> 00:28:56,592
Operation: fun and sun.

519
00:29:03,957 --> 00:29:05,557
Why'd you need a vest?

520
00:29:10,828 --> 00:29:13,278
I don't know why
i'm talking to myself.

521
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:17,888
Chemxtech.

522
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:20,449
I'm still talking to myself.

523
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:23,901
Chemxtech.

524
00:29:27,282 --> 00:29:28,659
Yeah, this is one of ours.

525
00:29:28,784 --> 00:29:31,477
Our polymer coating makes it light,
but it's pretty much indestructible.

526
00:29:32,815 --> 00:29:33,565
Yeah.

527
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,620
See this serial number?

528
00:29:36,781 --> 00:29:39,345
This vest is three years old.
Looks brand-new.

529
00:29:39,471 --> 00:29:42,031
Now, I don't think the soldier who
wore it ever took a bullet. See how

530
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:43,783
straight the fibers run?

531
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:46,242
- Where'd you get it?
- It was travis Slocum's.

532
00:29:47,158 --> 00:29:49,008
And that's hard to believe.

533
00:29:49,846 --> 00:29:52,248
Two years in Iraq.
Not a scratch.

534
00:29:52,783 --> 00:29:55,626
- You sell these to the army?
- Oh, still a little pricey.

535
00:29:56,972 --> 00:29:59,817
I convinced some friends at
the pentagon to outfit a few platoons.

536
00:29:59,942 --> 00:30:01,549
Put the merchandise in their hands.

537
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,608
First rule of sales.
I want to show you something.

538
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,473
I'm just gonna step over here
to set this up.

539
00:30:13,987 --> 00:30:14,937
Some day,

540
00:30:16,003 --> 00:30:17,595
you'll be wearing one of these.

541
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,347
- When they're cheaper?
- More we sell, the cheaper they get.

542
00:30:20,472 --> 00:30:21,822
And this is how I sell 'em.

543
00:30:22,089 --> 00:30:24,284
You know, lab tests...
They're fine.

544
00:30:24,757 --> 00:30:26,957
You really want to sell something?

545
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:29,653
You ready for this?

546
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:42,798
How great is that? Look at this.
I've done this 115 times.

547
00:30:45,337 --> 00:30:46,939
116 times.

548
00:30:50,043 --> 00:30:51,891
117 times.

549
00:30:52,246 --> 00:30:53,934
You can stop that now.

550
00:30:54,996 --> 00:30:58,272
I'm gonna get in guinness. No man
has ever shot himself more than I have.

551
00:31:00,714 --> 00:31:02,014
You want to try?

552
00:31:11,389 --> 00:31:13,370
Go ahead.
Taste one.

553
00:31:21,973 --> 00:31:23,473
It's like nothing...

554
00:31:25,035 --> 00:31:26,185
It's nothing.

555
00:31:26,846 --> 00:31:28,409
Until I say it's something.

556
00:31:28,534 --> 00:31:31,722
We extract the essence of grape
and then reformulate the fruit body.

557
00:31:32,409 --> 00:31:34,808
- The fruit body?
- It has an infinite shelf life.

558
00:31:35,221 --> 00:31:38,346
- It's not a grape.
- Not until chemxtech says it is.

559
00:31:38,471 --> 00:31:40,309
Stays fresh until
we inject the flavor.

560
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:42,634
That's not even on the market yet.

561
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,721
Beautiful, ain't it?

562
00:31:45,846 --> 00:31:47,646
Oh, yeah.
It's beautiful.

563
00:31:53,347 --> 00:31:55,908
This vest connects travis
to chemxtech.

564
00:31:56,033 --> 00:31:57,491
A lot of troops wear those vests.

565
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:59,917
These connect Norris to chemxtech.

566
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:03,158
Please do not ask me to go to the d. A.
Holding just those grapes.

567
00:32:03,283 --> 00:32:05,815
No, these aren't grapes.
Just the fruit body. And

568
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,035
you won't have to.

569
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,025
The dead junkie, Quentin Norris,

570
00:32:09,149 --> 00:32:11,510
washed out of the army
then bounced around the system.

571
00:32:11,635 --> 00:32:14,019
Got help from community outreach
paid for

572
00:32:14,143 --> 00:32:16,349
by a generous grant from chemxtech.

573
00:32:16,474 --> 00:32:19,511
Okay, so everything's connected.
The vest and the fruit bodies.

574
00:32:20,283 --> 00:32:24,483
But how does it end up in the death
of a decorated united states soldier?

575
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,152
Decorated, but not a scratch on him.

576
00:32:27,847 --> 00:32:31,658
Two years in Iraq, but not a scratch
on him. That's what Gus said.

577
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,883
Sadr city...

578
00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:39,237
You get one of these medals for getting
wounded in combat. Now

579
00:32:39,362 --> 00:32:41,875
if travis wasn't wounded in combat,
then...

580
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,443
Whose medal is it?

581
00:32:45,348 --> 00:32:48,029
Army sent this...
After action report.

582
00:32:48,393 --> 00:32:49,992
There weren't always four members.

583
00:32:50,117 --> 00:32:52,633
There was a fifth member
of this squad in sadr city.

584
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:53,898
Kit weston.

585
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:55,106
Wounded?

586
00:32:55,231 --> 00:32:57,224
Killed. Sniper fire. Chest wound.

587
00:32:57,974 --> 00:33:00,519
Died while Erin and Sims
were carrying him to the chopper.

588
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,823
Chest wound?

589
00:33:01,948 --> 00:33:04,286
W-wasn't he wearing
one of them vests?

590
00:33:04,411 --> 00:33:07,222
I mean, Gus showed you.
Bullets don't go through 'em, right?

591
00:33:07,347 --> 00:33:10,547
Bullets don't go through
the vest Gus showed me but...

592
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:15,326
maybe the vest Gus showed me
isn't the one they shipped overseas.

593
00:33:16,848 --> 00:33:20,377
Their buddy dies
because of a bad chemxtech vest.

594
00:33:20,783 --> 00:33:24,033
- They come over here to set it right.
- All together.

595
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:25,949
That's how they do it.

596
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,103
Sorry. Me again.

597
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:31,567
Anybody seen Gus?

598
00:33:32,705 --> 00:33:33,721
He's not here.

599
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,118
So the party's here,
the plane's here,

600
00:33:36,242 --> 00:33:37,847
but the host is missing.

601
00:33:37,972 --> 00:33:40,072
Security detail is missing, too.

602
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,610
I'm looking for returns.

603
00:34:21,963 --> 00:34:23,513
Is Gus in his office?

604
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,538
Where's Erin and Sims?

605
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:05,432
I'm alive.

606
00:35:05,557 --> 00:35:07,007
Yeah, you're alive.

607
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:09,022
Ah, I'm alive.
I'm alive!

608
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,482
Where's Erin and Sims?

609
00:35:11,272 --> 00:35:13,271
- Out that door.
- Where does it lead to?

610
00:35:13,396 --> 00:35:15,286
Through my private waiting room
back out to the hallway.

611
00:35:15,411 --> 00:35:16,587
Are they armed?

612
00:35:16,712 --> 00:35:17,462
Yeah.

613
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,049
They got my guns.

614
00:35:25,678 --> 00:35:28,035
They could be in any
of those offices.

615
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,960
Great to triangulate fire.

616
00:35:31,507 --> 00:35:32,507
I'm alive.

617
00:35:33,461 --> 00:35:34,911
Yeah, you're alive.

618
00:35:35,304 --> 00:35:37,354
But we've still gotta get you
out of here.

619
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,460
We know he died in sadr city.

620
00:35:49,585 --> 00:35:51,631
We know you were holding him
when he did.

621
00:35:51,756 --> 00:35:54,778
We know he was wearing
a chemxtech vest,

622
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,946
and I know you asked why, Erin.

623
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:01,700
Then you know you should send
Gus into the hall.

624
00:36:02,313 --> 00:36:03,513
Can't do that.

625
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,259
Wow, Gus.
They really don't like you.

626
00:36:08,384 --> 00:36:09,584
They broke in.

627
00:36:09,758 --> 00:36:10,758
Tied me up.

628
00:36:10,883 --> 00:36:12,683
Yeah?
What did they want?

629
00:36:13,851 --> 00:36:16,651
Were they looking through
all your files, Gus?

630
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,300
His vest killed kit.

631
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:20,719
Send Gus into the hall.

632
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,134
Look, they're out of their minds.

633
00:36:22,259 --> 00:36:24,648
Our vests work. They save lives.
I mean, you've seen it yourself.

634
00:36:24,773 --> 00:36:26,773
- They work.
- For two years.

635
00:36:28,007 --> 00:36:30,819
They work like a miracle for two years.

636
00:36:30,944 --> 00:36:33,244
It'll stop everything for two years.

637
00:36:33,864 --> 00:36:36,714
- And then...
- They stop stopping everything?

638
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,862
But the chemxtech catalog

639
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,739
says they got a shelf life
of five years.

640
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,407
They do. They work for five years.

641
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,509
I got a dead friend
that says they don't.

642
00:36:44,634 --> 00:36:47,133
If you had a problem with the vest,
why didn't you file a complaint?

643
00:36:47,258 --> 00:36:49,915
I don't think they were looking for
a class action suit, Gus.

644
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:53,124
The vests were chemxtech,
so we came here on leave.

645
00:36:53,249 --> 00:36:54,801
Travis got in the deepest.

646
00:36:54,925 --> 00:36:58,465
He got in their computers and traced
the sale of the vests to him.

647
00:37:00,684 --> 00:37:03,484
- Two days later...
- Travis Slocum was dead.

648
00:37:04,704 --> 00:37:07,391
You get that junkie Quentin Norris
to kill Slocum.

649
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:10,078
- 'cause that's a man's job.
- And then you killed Quentin Norris.

650
00:37:10,203 --> 00:37:11,937
'cause that was just drain cleaner.

651
00:37:12,828 --> 00:37:16,643
Detective, send him out, or we're gonna
come in there and get him.

652
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,078
Look, you gotta get me out of here.

653
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:20,409
Backup's still a few minutes away.
What do you wanna do, Charlie?

654
00:37:20,534 --> 00:37:21,835
What do you...
"what do you wanna do"?

655
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,616
You wanna get me out of here,
that's what you wanna do!

656
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:27,328
Okay.

657
00:37:27,894 --> 00:37:29,694
Let's get him out of here.

658
00:37:32,955 --> 00:37:34,905
We'll take him down the hall.

659
00:37:38,143 --> 00:37:39,243
Put this on.

660
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:41,133
Come on, let's go.
Put it on.

661
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:45,703
There's no time for that.

662
00:37:46,489 --> 00:37:48,278
Come on.
Put it on.

663
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,072
This was travis'.
Three years old.

664
00:37:54,642 --> 00:37:56,273
It's still got two years left in it.

665
00:37:56,398 --> 00:37:58,080
Just keep your head down
and tucked, hmm?

666
00:37:58,205 --> 00:38:00,255
Your vest should stop any fire.

667
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,309
Come on, Gus.

668
00:38:02,941 --> 00:38:05,189
You shot yourself 117 times.

669
00:38:05,314 --> 00:38:07,764
I changed the numbers from two to five.

670
00:38:10,227 --> 00:38:13,329
Our lab reports said two years' shelf
life, just like the other companies'.

671
00:38:14,297 --> 00:38:16,811
The war was only supposed to
last six weeks. Six weeks.

672
00:38:16,936 --> 00:38:19,171
I mean, who knew we'd still be
there six years later?

673
00:38:19,296 --> 00:38:21,096
Don't tell me.
Tell them.

674
00:38:23,017 --> 00:38:25,344
I changed the numbers from two to five.

675
00:38:35,263 --> 00:38:38,013
Who knew we'd still be there
six years later?

676
00:38:53,108 --> 00:38:55,308
I think your leave is probably up.

677
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:59,169
I think it probably is.

678
00:39:14,141 --> 00:39:15,894
You asked me here to look at your tv.

679
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,212
Well, we've never had one before.
What do you think?

680
00:39:19,581 --> 00:39:23,318
Also I'd like access to all the files
you have on Mickey Rayborn.

681
00:39:24,017 --> 00:39:26,238
Let me think about that... no.

682
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,156
I know I didn't kill him.

683
00:39:28,955 --> 00:39:31,355
I think roman nevikov ordered it done.

684
00:39:31,722 --> 00:39:34,020
But you spent a lot of time
with Mickey Rayborn

685
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:36,415
and I'd like to see
some of what you've seen.

686
00:39:36,854 --> 00:39:39,315
Oh, let me think about it again.
No.

687
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,290
Not no.

688
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,827
Yes. That's what I said
when I used to make deals.

689
00:39:44,952 --> 00:39:48,749
They would say no,
and I would say, "not no. Yes."

690
00:39:48,874 --> 00:39:52,556
Be that as it may,
I'm saying, "not yes. No."

691
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:56,025
Puryer investigations.

692
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,706
Quite a business.

693
00:39:57,831 --> 00:40:00,143
Wealthy clients.
Powerful clients.

694
00:40:00,741 --> 00:40:02,019
You know why they use you?

695
00:40:02,144 --> 00:40:04,692
My clients use me because of
my reputation,

696
00:40:04,816 --> 00:40:05,861
detective.

697
00:40:06,955 --> 00:40:11,021
Don't you just love that accent?
Everything sounds so smart.

698
00:40:12,173 --> 00:40:16,545
So if you had no reputation,
you would have no business.

699
00:40:20,115 --> 00:40:21,918
You got a client who lives there?

700
00:40:22,563 --> 00:40:24,296
Come on, you do.

701
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,095
I know this kid...
Lives with his mom,

702
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,330
Loves security, loves computers.

703
00:40:28,455 --> 00:40:29,881
Got us your client list...

704
00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:32,082
Your whole client list.

705
00:40:32,207 --> 00:40:34,394
Put up these cameras, too.
Live feed.

706
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:37,195
Oh, look!
There he is now.

707
00:40:40,327 --> 00:40:41,777
And my client list?

708
00:40:44,591 --> 00:40:45,741
What is that?

709
00:40:46,754 --> 00:40:48,517
Oh, this is the button
that makes me laugh.

710
00:40:48,642 --> 00:40:49,905
Do you want to push it?

711
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,868
Oh, okay, ted, you...
Go ahead. Go ahead, push it.

712
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:02,969
My reputation?

713
00:41:06,971 --> 00:41:08,221
My client list.

714
00:41:10,386 --> 00:41:12,451
My entire client list.

715
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,880
Okay, detective.

716
00:41:19,522 --> 00:41:21,022
I've seen your wall.

717
00:41:21,768 --> 00:41:23,518
Now let me show you mine.

718
00:41:27,492 --> 00:41:29,736
These are our in-house security
of Mr. Rayborn.

719
00:41:30,332 --> 00:41:32,989
Oh, there you are,
being taken out of his car.

720
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:34,908
What about the night he was killed?

721
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,826
System had been corrupted

722
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:38,245
that night.

723
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:41,873
Our cameras on his boats
were inoperable.

724
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,408
What are these?

725
00:41:47,533 --> 00:41:50,506
These are images I had taken off
Mr. Rayborn's computer.

726
00:41:50,853 --> 00:41:52,388
I haven't fully processed these yet.

727
00:41:52,473 --> 00:41:54,001
- Who took these?
- I don't know.

728
00:41:54,126 --> 00:41:57,356
It was possible he was employing
secondary security.

729
00:41:58,763 --> 00:41:59,513
Stop.

730
00:42:00,131 --> 00:42:01,031
Go back.

731
00:42:02,922 --> 00:42:04,222
That one, there.

732
00:42:05,331 --> 00:42:06,940
Go full-screen on that one.

733
00:42:10,894 --> 00:42:11,744
Closer.

734
00:42:14,725 --> 00:42:16,508
Is that Dani Reese?
