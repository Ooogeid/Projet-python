1
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,360
Neighbors downstairs weren't too happy
when her blood came through the ceiling,

2
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,610
started dripping on their
pancakes. Called 911.

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,670
Stab wounds.

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,980
At least three of them.

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,940
No signs of struggle or forced entry.

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,820
It was someone she knew well
enough to let walk right up to her.

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,250
Someone she made dinner for.

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,230
She got dressed up, set
the table, lit the candles.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,910
Perfume, makeup.

10
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,290
I guess she was hoping the
night would end differently.

11
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,240
She didn't even turn around.

12
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,980
Just sat there as the
knife went into her.

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,070
It's a nice place.

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,260
Not much of her here.

15
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,060
Just a pool of blood on the floor.

16
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:56,220
And this. Got a tattoo here.
The name ben in a heart.

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,140
Got a driver's license here, hannah
ronson, issued three months back.

18
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,870
Look like this girl just got here.

19
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,820
Car keys. Jaguar.

20
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,950
Lwa?

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,920
If this is hannah ronson and
the tattoooos ben, who's lwa?

22
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,010
Go see if that matches any of
the cars in the building's lot.

23
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,900
Okay.

24
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,020
I guess they were
working up an appetite.

25
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,810
This first, then dinner.

26
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:37,050
"France, seven million and up.
"Must learn french. Ooh la la."

27
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,000
That's not gonna happen now.

28
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,410
Ooh la la.

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,850
"Sail boat or power boat?

30
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,470
Sail boat and power boat."

31
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,580
"60 days or 90 days?"

32
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, and plastic surgery.

33
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,880
Looks like hannah liked to spend.

34
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,750
Lwa?

35
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,650
Maybe hannah wasn't
shopping with her own money.

36
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,960
She was shopping with lwa'S.

37
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,500
Detective.

38
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,900
Anything else in the car?

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,680
That's all there was.

40
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,770
Brand-new jaguar leased to a
hannah ronson three months ago.

41
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,630
A parking pass.

42
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,130
St. Thomas church.

43
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,950
Church, huh, hannah?

44
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,750
Parkininpass for a church.

45
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,670
St. Thomas.

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,910
Lwa isn't someone's initials.

47
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,070
I mean, I don't know what the "l" and the
"w" stand for, but "a" stands for "anonymous."

48
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,040
It's a support group.

49
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,940
Church parking.

50
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,010
Exactly what kind of support do
you think hannah was getting here?

51
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,820
Is this where lwa meets?

52
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,830
yes, we're lwa.

53
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,750
Could you tell us what it stands for?

54
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,510
Lottery winners anonymous.

55
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,380
Lottery winners.

56
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,000
You're all lottery winners.

57
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,530
Lwa.

58
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes, but we're only for
winners of 20 million or more.

59
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,030
Anything under that, and we're
gonna have to ask you two to leave.

60
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,490
Is hannah ronson a member of this group?

61
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,390
We're anonymous. We
don't use last names.

62
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,140
But there is a hannah
that belongs here. Why?

63
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,980
Hannah ronson was found dead
in her loft this morning.

64
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,900
Was it an accident?

65
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,000
No, it wasn't an accident.
And what's your name?

66
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,640
- Tom.
- Tom who?

67
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,120
Hannah--ahem. Our
hannah--some-- oh...

68
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,510
somebody--

69
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,060
he's saying someone killed
hannah, numb-nuts. You heard him.

70
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,250
And what's your name?

71
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,800
- it's dale.
- And you are?

72
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,140
Ben.

73
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,860
Dale, you have to take
shallow breaths, okay?Dale--

74
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,150
dale, you have to take
shallow breaths. Okay.

75
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,170
Dale, you gotta take
shallow breaths, all right?

76
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,020
Otherwise you're
just gonna-- pass out.

77
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,200
You got any paper bags, ben?

78
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,650
God, that was so embarrassing.

79
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,810
I've seen people have much worse
reactions to news like that.

80
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,690
You don't want to know.

81
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,200
But a reaction like that, dale,

82
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:59,360
usually comes from someone
who's pretty close to the victim.

83
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,530
Can you not use that word?

84
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,790
Can you call her by her name?

85
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,030
By hannah.

86
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,670
Were you close to hannah?

87
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,640
How close were you?

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,360
- 75
- Million?

89
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,340
Yes.

90
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,480
Hannah was just 34, but
still it was so hard for her.

91
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,160
What was so hard for her?

92
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:31,110
Well, like most of us, hannah came here
because she couldn't relate to the ulos anymore.

93
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,270
The ulos?

94
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,340
The unlucky ones.

95
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:38,310
Hannah won the florida lottery last
year, then the ulos at home got to her.

96
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,730
When you hit it like us, suddenly
everyone wants something from you.

97
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,840
A loan, a gift, a car, a boat.

98
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,870
So she moved from florida to L.A.

99
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,980
A few months back. Tried to start over.

100
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,320
She liked it here.

101
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,050
You know, in this
room, we all have money,

102
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,280
so the only thing we want
from each other is each other.

103
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,530
And when did she get the tattoo
with your name on it, ben?

104
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,450
Look, no one here knew we were together.

105
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,420
She didn't want anybody to
know, so that was just for me.

106
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,530
For us.

107
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,850
Hey, reese. Tom, the tall
skinny guy. Where'd he go?

108
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,880
That old nova's gone.

109
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,280
Yeah, that's tom car.

110
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,820
He hits the lottery and drives that
old beater? What was his number?

111
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,980
Oh, tom was a big one. 173 million.

112
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,450
You got a last name on tom?

113
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,570
We're anonymous. No last names.
He's just tom. That's all we know.

114
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,490
All right, well, you're
not anonymous anymore.

115
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,210
We're gonna be needing last names
and addresses from all of you.

116
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,650
Yo, dale!

117
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,340
Is the meeting over or what, man?

118
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,500
We wanna get a'rollin'.

119
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,520
My posse.

120
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,610
A support group for
lottery winners. Holy moley.

121
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,590
Studies show 80% of all lottery
winners regret ever having won it.

122
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,690
You just made that up.

123
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,100
No, it's the truth.

124
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,100
Then the truth is stupid.

125
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,250
Could the truth be stupid?

126
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,140
Googled hannah ronson.

127
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,810
Won the florida lottery
last year, 34 million.

128
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,860
Got a photo of her here
with that big check.

129
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,710
I get that check, I
would not get support.

130
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,640
I would, however, get a hockey
team and a blimp with a bar.

131
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,200
That's what you should
get. A blimp with a bar.

132
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,690
Then you could float
around, have some brews.

133
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,730
Hannah ronson. Stabbed.
Bled out on scene.

134
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,840
Crime scene indicates
it was someone she knew.

135
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,030
She didn't have a family
here. She didn't have a job.

136
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,880
Search of her loft
found no address book.

137
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,630
Looks like the only friends she made since
she moved from florida were the people in lwa.

138
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,820
So she was closer to
these two than the others?

139
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,190
close enough to ben to
have his name on her skin.

140
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,070
I think dale went there too.

141
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:54,310
What about the $173 million dollar man?

142
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,440
Tom.

143
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,810
All the big lottery winners sign on to
do publicity, so we're running that down.

144
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,650
Okay. We're going to go.

145
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,490
Detective reese, can I have a word?

146
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,410
I want to talk to you about something.

147
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,200
No, you don'T.

148
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,630
Pretty sure I do.

149
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,630
I'm pretty sure you don'T.

150
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,280
The heart wants what the hearts wants.

151
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,000
A bodyguard?

152
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,090
Yes, because of what happened to hannah.

153
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,920
I think some of the others are getting
bodyguards too, but can you blame us?

154
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:42,830
She was murdered.

155
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,200
Ben, how long had you
been seeing hannah?

156
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,780
About six weeks.

157
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,460
And it was a sexual relationship?

158
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,370
Yes, we were sleeping together.

159
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,270
When did she put your name on her skin?

160
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,090
Last month.

161
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,270
Did you know she was
seeing others in the group?

162
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,240
- Who?
- I'll take that as a no.

163
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,240
Hannah and I were in love, detectives.

164
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,510
She liked me for me, not for my money.

165
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,740
Okay, since I hit the jackpot, girls I don't even
know have been telling me how much they love me.

166
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,050
But with hananh...

167
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,040
look, I just knew that she meant it.

168
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:24,140
And if she was with other guys, I'm sorry,
I just don't believe that. I just don'T.

169
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,530
Ben, where were you last night?

170
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,490
I was here waiting for hannah.

171
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,040
You know, if I'm not with her or
at group, I'm usually just alone.

172
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,290
- Since you won the money.
- Yeah.

173
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,420
You haven't really spent much of it.

174
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,730
Well, I bought my mom a house,
'cause you gotta buy your mom a house.

175
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,170
But I was just looking for
something good to do with that money.

176
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:46,150
And, um, you know, hannah...

177
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,290
I can't believe she's dead.

178
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,640
I mean, what do I have now, you know?

179
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,010
Probably not gonna stay long.

180
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,350
Okay.

181
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,060
I'm not gonna tell you anything.

182
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,440
I'm not gonna ask you anything.

183
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,620
About jack reese or anything else.

184
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,570
Not gonna ask you anything about
jack reese or anything else.

185
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,380
So all this money just for
staying in jail for 12 years?

186
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,280
I could do that.

187
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,510
You sure this is the
address dale gave you?

188
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,500
Yeah, I wrote it down.

189
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,680
Well, it looks like dale lied to you.

190
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,390
Didn't have dale pegged as a liar.

191
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,760
What about a killer?

192
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,350
Dale saiaihe lived here, but there is
no house here, so dale can't live here.

193
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,860
Honey, I'm home.

194
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,550
Yeah, that's right. Tv's ponch from
chips. He's being very well compensated.

195
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,530
All these other people.

196
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,100
Are they, uh, are they being
well compensated too, dale?

197
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,630
People like a party, right?

198
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:30,730
You live on this bus?

199
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,570
Yeah, I got this land here and
some more out in the desert.

200
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,970
That way I can park the
party wherever I want.

201
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,340
Did hannah like to party?

202
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,960
Tell us a bit about your
relationship with hannah, dale.

203
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,010
Hannah...

204
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,320
she was right on, you know what I mean?

205
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,830
Explain it to me.

206
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,020
We fooled around a little.But
it was nice knowing--

207
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,970
knowing that she wanted you
for you, not for your money?

208
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,490
Yeah.

209
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,140
But she saw I was still
into having this, you know.

210
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,610
Kid in a candy store, you know?

211
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,830
She said when I was done
with this, she'd be there.

212
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,940
You mean she dumped you?

213
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,360
How'd that make you feel?

214
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,380
To tell you the truth, it
made me want her even more.

215
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,720
Dale, where were you the
night hannah was killed?

216
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,460
Here on the bus.

217
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,740
My posse, they can tell you.

218
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:23,530
These aren't your real friends,
dale, so why should we believe them?

219
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,080
You're right. They're
not my real friends.

220
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,940
Hannah was my real friend.

221
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,180
You guys are gonna find
who killed her, right?

222
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,120
My ride's here. I gotta go.

223
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,490
You're charlie crews, aren't you?

224
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,740
That's right.

225
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,360
I'm a big fan of yours.

226
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,460
$173 million dollar tom is tom bruckner.

227
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:11,270
According to the press release, he worked
in the defense industry for nearly 20 years.

228
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,840
He took all his
winnings in one lump sum.

229
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,020
Quit his job.

230
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,420
Why'd it take so long to find him?

231
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:20,510
I mean, how many $173 million
winners named tom are out there?

232
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,560
Because two years ago,
tom was a lot more jolly.

233
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,560
What happened to him?

234
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,380
He won the lottery.

235
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,590
We have his address.
We're going there now.

236
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,390
Detective reese, a word.

237
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,390
I wanted to talk about the kiss.

238
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,360
- What kiss?
- What kiss?

239
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,760
He worked in the defense industry?

240
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,230
Yeah, for nearly 20 years.

241
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,990
You see a buzzer?

242
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,630
No. What are you doing?

243
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,900
I'm gonna go knock on the door.

244
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,090
Here, hold the can.

245
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,960
And you're climbing his fence to do it?

246
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:17,670
Yeah. I was first in my fence
climbing class at pelican bay.

247
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,830
Failed out of tunneling, though.

248
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,010
You ever tried to dig
with a spoon? Tough stuff.

249
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,540
mister. I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

250
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,520
Why not? He have dogs?

251
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:33,170
No, no dogs. He's got guns.

252
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,830
don't move!

253
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,700
I'm a cop.

254
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,070
- crews!
- Still here.

255
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,360
Stay where you are.

256
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,090
Why'd you climb my fence?

257
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,750
Just wanted to ring your doorbell.

258
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,200
I'm gonna show you my badge, okay?

259
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,780
crews!

260
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,750
Still here.

261
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:11,350
I guess I'll be inviting
you in as a hostage now.

262
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,030
Hands up!

263
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,840
And move toward the house.

264
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,980
What's with the fence, tom?

265
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,340
And the metal shutters?

266
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,740
Toward the door now.

267
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,830
Keep those hands up.

268
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,680
What's with all the guns, tom?

269
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,450
Get in and close the door.

270
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:43,210
$173 million, and you've
got swat on your curb.

271
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,800
Get in and close the door.

272
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,140
A gun like that? Could've
shot me right off that fence.

273
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,460
Are you really a killer, tom?

274
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,890
Get in. Close the door.

275
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,640
If I close that door, you
know what happens next.

276
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,930
Someone dies.

277
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,130
Me. You. Both of us, maybe.

278
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,970
Saw some pictures of you
from a few years ago, tom.

279
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,850
That guy wasn't wearing that helmet.

280
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,860
That guy was wearing a smile.

281
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,140
Are you really a killer, tom?

282
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,120
You sure you're okay?

283
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,240
Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

284
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,860
Sometimes an emotional injury
doesn't show itself right away.

285
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,280
I'm fine. Thank you.

286
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,310
Yeah, I'm fine too, if you're asking.

287
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,650
- Lots of guns.
- But no knife.

288
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,090
Hannah was killed with a knife.

289
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,610
You think the money did this to him?

290
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,230
Made him like this?

291
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,570
No, it's something else.

292
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,580
He was getting ready for something.

293
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,640
Hey, look at this.

294
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,760
This... is them.

295
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,150
He put a spy camera in my house?

296
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,020
Well, I didn't know that, but
it sure doesn't surprise me.

297
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,970
Why doesn't it surprise you?

298
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,620
Tom and I worked together
for nearly 20 years.

299
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,250
Carpooled, in and out
of each other's houses.

300
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,360
Tom and I used to split
the cost of lottery tickets.

301
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,350
I'd give him a dollar,
and he'd buy them at lunch.

302
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,480
One day, I forgot to give him a dollar.

303
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,970
- And that was the day he won?
- Yeah.

304
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,090
I haven't seen him since. He
quit work. Put up those fences.

305
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,010
He doesn't talk to me.
Doesn't talk to anyone.

306
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,290
I mean, we used to be best friends.

307
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,230
Reese.

308
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,810
Thanks.

309
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,150
And did you ever see him with a
woman named hannah? No. Interesting.

310
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,200
Dale, what are you doing here?

311
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,870
Okay, listen, I have
all this money, right?

312
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,700
But what am I really doing with my life?

313
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,120
Maybe I can help find who killed hannah.

314
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,760
You should just let
the police handle that.

315
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,750
I saw you talking to those people
over there. Are they involved?

316
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,970
Dale, what did I just say?

317
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,940
Does the apple help?

318
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,270
Help? With what?

319
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,040
With the solving of crime.

320
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,490
You know you're a suspect, right?

321
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,440
Yeah, I just-- I just wanted to know if
the apple helped. I'm new to all this.

322
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,950
Okay, I'm going.

323
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,930
detectives.

324
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,500
His cash, he had it
buried in the basement.

325
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,150
That's just crazy, right?

326
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,460
That's just crazy, right?

327
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,420
Why'd you shoot at my partner, tom?

328
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,280
He was coming over the wall.

329
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,930
I thought he was coming to
get my money, and I was right.

330
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,490
It's all been logged
with the property clerk.

331
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,790
Like things haven't
been lost there before?

332
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,020
Let's discuss hannah.

333
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,240
Why'd you run when we told
you she'd been murdered?

334
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,200
Because I know who killed her.

335
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,430
And I thought he'd
be coming for me next.

336
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,860
I needed to get ready.

337
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:40,010
Tom... who killed hannah?

338
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,840
Ronald.

339
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,450
Your friend from across the street?

340
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,790
He's not my friend.

341
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,610
You carpooled for 20 years.

342
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,900
In and out of each other's house.

343
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,480
You used to split the
cost of lottery tickets.

344
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,450
But not that day. The day i won.

345
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,980
Not on your lucky day, right, tom?

346
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,240
I know he wanted my money.

347
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,920
And he couldn't get to it.

348
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:08,770
So he took the only other thing I had.

349
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:14,500
Tom, are you saying that you were
having a relationship with hannah?

350
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:18,580
Hannah loved me for who I was.

351
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,660
Ronald couldn't get my money.

352
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,930
So he took hannah instead.

353
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,850
Maybe you can tell us where you
were the night hannah was killed.

354
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,800
Gun show in covina.

355
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,420
Picked up a bushmaster 223.

356
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,610
You can ask my dealer. He'll tell you.

357
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:48,110
the night that woman was killed, I
was bowling with my wife and kids.

358
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,680
Family league night.

359
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,190
All right, well, we'll
need to check that out.

360
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,030
He thought I wanted
his money. I never did.

361
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,110
All I really wanted was
to be his friend again.

362
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,170
You want to say that to him?

363
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,430
Yeah.

364
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:13,500
So the guy who doesn't win the
lottery goes bowling with his family...

365
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,470
and the guy who wins spends his
nights all by himself at gun shows.

366
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,020
book him for shooting at you two.

367
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,920
Then run down that alibi.

368
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,560
We should do a psych evaluation.

369
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,060
I'll do an evaluation right now.

370
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,000
Technically, he's bonkers.

371
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,170
So you think he killed hannah?

372
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,730
No, he's a gun man. Hannah was stabbed.

373
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,690
Then put him in a butterfly
net and find me a real suspect.

374
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,500
Hannah had a relationship
with all three of them.

375
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,310
Yeah.

376
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,340
Ben, I get. Dale, I
kind of get. But tom?

377
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,720
Reese, why would a beautiful
woman date a man like tom?

378
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,710
For the money.

379
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,520
Why would a beautiful woman date a
man like tom if she had her own money?

380
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,190
Yeah, all right.

381
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,870
Okay, I got a match on
our dead girl's prints.

382
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,840
Her name is not hannah ronson.

383
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,970
It's leann pembers.

384
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,680
And I'm guessing leann pembers
did not win the florida lottery.

385
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,450
I don't know if leann ever was
in florida, but she did, however,

386
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,880
spend a little time in georgia.

387
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,900
In what capacity?

388
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,230
Three years in the state pen.

389
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,810
Mail fraud, insurance fraud.

390
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,610
Leann pembers is not a lottery winner.

391
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,020
Leann pembers is a con artist.

392
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,360
Yeah. Got a recent
address here for her too.

393
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:34,710
I'm guessing it's not
some pricey loft downtown.

394
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,640
Oh, look at this. Men's clothes.

395
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:06,810
Looks like leann pembers had a friend.

396
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,340
A con this big you don't
pull off by yourself.

397
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:19,500
So... who wears those boots?

398
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:29,010
Okay, so the loft that she
was living in, foreclosed on.

399
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,280
Lease papers were fake.

400
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,510
The jag in the parking lot
leased with fake credit.

401
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,130
You google hannah ronson's name, you
get taken to all kinds of fake web sites.

402
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,230
- This girl was good.
- Was.

403
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,510
Any I.D.For the owner of the boots?

404
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,400
No, but I did find this.

405
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:45,750
Small business incorporation papers,
credit application, lease agreements.

406
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,740
It's how they built up the
credit for this lottery con.

407
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,180
These go back a few years.

408
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,430
A long con takes a lot of work.

409
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:55,670
And all these papers have
the same bank as a reference--

410
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,150
bank of central california.

411
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,140
- Why don't you call that 800 number?
- Yeah.

412
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,390
bank of central california.
How may I help you?

413
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,830
Yes, I'd like to open up a new account.
Can you tell me where you're located?

414
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,320
I'm sorry, sir. We're not
accepting new accounts at this time.

415
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,240
Yeah, detective reese.

416
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,900
I need a location on the number
I just dialed from this phone.

417
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,640
Really? All right, thanks.

418
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:28,990
Turns out the bank of central
california is just two floors down.

419
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,660
Maybe we should invite 'em up.

420
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,230
You're the bank of central california?

421
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,190
Look...

422
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:39,690
We have you for it. And I'm guessing...

423
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,000
I'm guessing gasoline scams too.

424
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,750
I'll just plead the fifth on that.

425
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,500
Right now, we're working homicide.

426
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:50,060
U want, we start working fraud.

427
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,230
Leann gave us a phone.

428
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,120
When that phone rings, we're
the bank of central california.

429
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,600
We clear her credit, she gives us a cut.

430
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,750
That's all you do?

431
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,270
I do some other phone work as well.

432
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,180
But leann wasn't a part of that.

433
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,850
How was it that leann passed?

434
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,850
She was stabbed to death.

435
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,680
Sweet girl.

436
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,970
She worked a nice grift.

437
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,050
Maybe you can help us.

438
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,500
Who wears those boots?

439
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,350
- Lenny.
- Lenny what?

440
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,250
Getz, hoyt, breen, ryan, silver.

441
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:30,970
All right, we get it.

442
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,610
moved in about a year ago.

443
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,390
We don't come around so much since.

444
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,800
Why not?

445
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,670
Because he's mean.

446
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,620
Mean's just where lenny starts.

447
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:43,640
He sucked the life right out of leann.

448
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,600
Well, maybe he did.

449
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,580
What's he look like?

450
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,970
Long hair, mangy beard.

451
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,690
Rere dirty.

452
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,940
But she loved him.

453
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:56,270
Some women have the worst taste in men.

454
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,910
You go after lenny, you better
bring more than that pretty smile.

455
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,050
a con artist?

456
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,220
What, and she had done time in prison?

457
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,070
In and out since she was 16.

458
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,270
Is that what got her killed?

459
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,020
You mean someone found out she was
conning them and then killed her?

460
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,110
Where were you that night?

461
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,190
He told us. He was here, alone.

462
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,290
Right. Ben, did she ever
mention a guy named lenny?

463
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:22,810
Lenny? Um, no, no. No,
she, uh, she never did.

464
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,100
Long hair, beard, dirty.

465
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,530
Anything like that ring a bell?

466
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,230
And you picked up that bodyguard
there the day after she died?

467
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,900
Yes, a bunch of us did, though.

468
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,470
No, we asked the others.

469
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,750
You're the only one who felt
like he needed protection, ben.

470
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,040
Who are you afraid of, ben?

471
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,420
Who do you need protection from?

472
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:44,300
I think I'd like both of
you to leave right now.

473
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,230
You don't like pepperoni?

474
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,860
Don't like pizza.

475
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,080
How come you don't
havav a kitchen table?

476
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:09,840
I'm trying to lead an uncluttered life.

477
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,660
A kitchen table isn't clutter.

478
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:14,240
A kitchen table is a kitchen table.

479
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,410
Hey, ted, how's your
hand? Is it healing okay?

480
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:22,080
Yeah, of course it's healing okay.
Why wouldn't it be healing okay?

481
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,660
It's just something you
might say at the dinner table.

482
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,930
If we had a dinner table.

483
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:34,210
I, uh, fell on a pencil
during the earthquake and, um,

484
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,410
had it taken out by a
doctor in the earthquake.

485
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:41,270
And, um, now it's healing.

486
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,530
Crews. Dale?

487
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,320
Hey, dale-- dale,
slow down, okay?

488
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:55,610
Okay, where are you? Okay.
I gotta borrow your car.

489
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,750
Where are you going?

490
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,990
I'm gonna go see someone.

491
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,870
I'm coming with you.

492
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,360
No, you're not coming with me.

493
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:03,040
I've been in this house all
day. I'm coming with you.

494
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:06,610
Okay, but you stay in the car.

495
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,230
I went after ben.

496
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,420
What do you mean "went after"?

497
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,250
Ben killed hannah.

498
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,610
And you told that to ben?

499
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:33,550
I didn't really get a chance to.
His bodyguard kind of got in the way.

500
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:38,300
Dale, you gotta stop doing this,
or I'm gonna arrest you, okay?

501
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,710
I know she lied to me.

502
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,100
I know it was a con.

503
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:49,500
She made me happy, and now she's dead.

504
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,990
I'm a man. I'm supposed
to do something about that.

505
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,710
Why is his hair dyed that color?

506
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,410
Is that your daughter?

507
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,900
Niece, kind of. Niece.

508
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:03,900
Oh, man, did you ever get tuned up.

509
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,200
Don't just sit there. Maybe you
can get a wet towel or something?

510
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,410
It's not so bad. You'll be
just fine. I've seen worse.

511
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,710
What worse things could
a girl like you have seen?

512
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,490
I've seen some stuff.

513
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:31,410
You'd swear it was a nightmare,
except your eyes were wide open.

514
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,740
- You know?
- Yeah, I know.

515
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,490
Okay, come on. Come on,
we're going. Come on.

516
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,000
I do that too.

517
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,430
- Do what?
- What you just did.

518
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,030
Tell a total stranger
the absolute truth.

519
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,900
It helps sosetimes.

520
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,270
Doesn't it help, dale?

521
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,720
Rachel just told you that she'd seen some
stuff, and you said, "yeah, you know"?

522
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:11,990
How do you know? You put on that suit. Show
up at crime scenes. Pretend to be a cop.

523
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:14,780
Why?

524
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,820
I told you why. To find her killer.
I mean, I have all this money.

525
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,230
You should understand wanting that.

526
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,650
I understand that you took
a beating tonight, dale.

527
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:29,080
I understand you keep doing things the
way you're doing them, it's not about want.

528
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,980
It's about need.

529
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,860
Why'd you need this?

530
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:40,550
I was there. At hannah'S.

531
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,390
The night she died. I saw her.

532
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,160
Rachel, go outside.

533
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:49,160
Go outside now, rachel.

534
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:55,220
Dumping me only made me want her more.

535
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,730
I just wanted to see her.

536
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,910
What did you see?

537
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,070
The door was open.

538
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:09,680
She was there at the table alone.

539
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,530
God, there was so much blood.

540
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:18,010
She couldn't talk.
She tried to. And I...

541
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:22,430
stood there for just
a second, and she died.

542
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,170
- I was...
- afraid.

543
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,650
I left her there.

544
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,370
Alone.

545
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,130
She was dead, but I left her alone.

546
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:41,940
- I ran as-- -
a coward, dale?

547
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:46,260
You didn't tell me
this before because...

548
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,930
'cause it would look like I
maybe had something to do with it.

549
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,550
Yeah.

550
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,470
that's exactly what it looks like, dale.

551
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,740
I have to take that girl home.

552
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,430
A uniform will come by and get you.

553
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,750
Why not me?

554
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,420
It was that damn tattoo.

555
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,980
The one that says "ben"?

556
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:17,590
It didn't always say that.

557
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,690
When I first knew her, she had
a small one. It said "lenny."

558
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,540
Some guy from her past.

559
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:28,290
And then she covered it up
with the one that said "ben."

560
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,390
Why his name?

561
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,150
Why not me?

562
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,550
- Is it everywhere?
- What?

563
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,930
Blood.

564
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,160
Yeah, it is.

565
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:54,210
I need to call my partner, and
then I'm gonna drop you home.

566
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,630
I think someone was trying to
call in while you were calling out.

567
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,670
Yeah, I know.

568
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,370
I think you cut them off.

569
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,600
Yeah, I know.

570
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,740
I think you cut them off again.

571
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,950
I think there's something
wrong with my E. One.

572
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,740
Yeah, that's probably it.

573
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,170
Reese, I was just calling you.

574
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:26,290
No, I was just calling you.
You were hanging up on me.

575
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,990
My phone malfunctioned.

576
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:32,720
What were you gonna tell me?

577
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,660
Stabbed.

578
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:42,920
Looks like the same kind of
blade that got leann pembers.

579
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,010
It is everywhere.

580
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,560
Blood.

581
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,950
Where is this guy?

582
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,650
He's still working the con.

583
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,670
Lenny must've found out
they talked to the police.

584
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,810
He found out because we told him.

585
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,460
You can't just come in here.

586
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:10,080
We thought we heard screams for help.

587
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,450
I thought I heard screams for help.

588
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,130
We thought we heard screams.

589
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,330
Two more killings. Same as hannah.

590
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,780
It looks like lenny did these too.

591
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,450
God, it's a good thing
you've got a bodyguard.

592
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,240
It's a good thing he's got you.

593
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,660
Because I think that you'd be the
one lenny would want a piece of.

594
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,850
Why would you think that?

595
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,880
Because maybe hannah
really fell for you, ben.

596
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:28,500
Maybe it wasn't a con.

597
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,160
She did tattoo your name on her flesh.

598
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,840
No, that was a lie, and
that was for the con.

599
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:34,010
Was it a lie?

600
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,560
There was a tattoo there
before. Did you know that? Yeah.

601
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:39,470
A tattoo that said "lenny.
" But she covered that up.

602
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,540
She covered it up with your name, ben.

603
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:44,660
She covered over "lenny" for you.

604
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,780
What the hell was that?

605
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:50,090
An apple. Dale was right.

606
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,400
It does help in the solving of crimes.

607
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:54,900
You are not a very good
bodyguard. You know that, robert?

608
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:58,440
I've been watching you. All
you do is watch your client.

609
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,950
That's how I got you
with that pippin there.

610
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,220
You're supposed to be
watching everybody else.

611
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,220
That's where the threat is coming from.

612
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,380
Didn't they teach you
that in bodyguard school?

613
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,120
So I'm thinking if you're
always watching your client,

614
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:15,030
then maybe the threat is
coming from your client. But...

615
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,540
what kind of threat
could your client be?

616
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,200
She wrote ben's name on her flesh.

617
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,990
Covered over that other name.

618
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,090
Covered over lenny's name.

619
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:31,750
You think lenny asked her why she did it, or
just saw the tattoo and went for his knife?

620
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,550
You're not really a bodyguard, are you?

621
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,260
Lenny.

622
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,150
God!

623
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,430
That bitch.

624
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,050
She covered me up.

625
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,730
We've been looking for that knife.

626
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,480
Well, I guess we'll
know where it is now.

627
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,570
The day after hannah died...

628
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:12,180
he showed up at my door, and
he tells me he's her husband.

629
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:18,210
and that he had broken into my house, taken
one of my kitchen knives with my fingerprints,

630
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,710
and killed her with it.

631
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,180
And unless you paid him, that
knife was going to the police.

632
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,770
Did he show you the knife?

633
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:34,160
- That was a lie too?
- Yeah. And what about the money?

634
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:38,920
I'd been moving it $10 million at a time, so
another few days, and he would've had it all.

635
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:43,870
Ben, did lenny say he'd let you go
free after he'd taken all your money?

636
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,200
That was a lie too.

637
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:53,040
Yeah. That was a lie too.

638
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,960
hey, how's the leg?

639
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:07,650
As luck would have it, I'm
a bit of a knife man myself.

640
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:12,260
I have someone here who
wants to talk to you.

641
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:23,430
Plastic surgery partners
of beverly hills.

642
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,210
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

643
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,170
Go on, tell him.

644
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:32,860
Hannah had an appointment there
next week to get her tattoo removed.

645
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:33,860
That's a lie.

646
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:37,610
No, it's not. She was getting
the "ben" tattoo taken off.

647
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,670
She made the doctor promise that
when he was through with her,

648
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:46,650
the lenny tattoo would look
like it had never been covered.

649
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,500
That's a lie.

650
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,910
She wasn't leaving you, lenny.

651
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,640
She was just working the job.

652
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,300
That's a lie.

653
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:57,580
Is it?

654
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,550
It's a lie.

655
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,710
Dale.

656
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,970
Really?

657
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:26,880
Okay.

658
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,150
After 30 years of marriage,
my dad walks out on my mom.

659
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,400
He writes a note. He...

660
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:51,050
takes the car and goes.

661
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,790
Sorry, I thought you were someone else.

662
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,500
So your dad walked out on your mom, huh?

663
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,800
I don't reallyant to talk about it.

664
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,280
Or you don't want to
talk to me about it.

665
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:12,300
Which is okay, because, I mean,

666
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,800
I look at myself sometimes
in the mirror and I say,

667
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,910
if I weren't me, I wouldn't want
to talk to me either, you know?

668
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:23,260
All right, I don't know your dad, I don't
know your mom, but I do know divorce.

669
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:29,450
So come to dinner with me, and I'll
just give you the rundown on how it goes.

670
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,250
I don't think so. Thanks.

671
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,030
Come on, I'll make it easy on you.

672
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,340
I'll concede to your list of demands.

673
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,990
How could you possibly
know what my demands are?

674
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,690
Oh, it's easy.

675
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:50,210
To go to dinr with me,
public place, well lit,

676
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:53,990
someplace no one you
know will see you with me.

677
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,950
No bar. No sex talk.
No use of the word sex.

678
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,250
Am I close? I'm close, right?

679
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:20,670
I used to look at the newspapers.

680
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:24,680
What they said you did to my family.

681
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,900
You know what I used to wish?

682
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:33,600
I used to wish that
you had killed me too.

683
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:49,330
You didn't kill my family, did you?

684
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:55,410
Everyone said you did it.

685
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,880
Over and over, they
said you killed them.

686
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,690
Even after what
I saw that night--

687
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,310
you thought I did it too.

688
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:08,940
Even after what I saw,
I thought you did it.

689
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:14,310
You want to know something?

690
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:18,860
For a few years when I
