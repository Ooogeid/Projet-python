1
00:00:00,673 --> 00:00:02,153
<i>Previously on life...</i>

2
00:00:02,276 --> 00:00:04,776
<i>You were the lead detective
on the charlie crews murder case?</i>

3
00:00:04,899 --> 00:00:06,570
Yeah, i worked that case.

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,573
No dna's gonna tell me
we got the wrong guy.

5
00:00:09,694 --> 00:00:12,250
You should ask your partner
about the bank of l. A. Shootout.

6
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,588
That was 15 years ago.

7
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,075
You should ask your partner.

8
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:16,949
What happened to all that money.

9
00:00:17,069 --> 00:00:19,956
Do you wanna talk about why
you're packing books into these boxes?

10
00:00:20,082 --> 00:00:22,417
I'm going to need them
with me in new york.

11
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:25,293
So i guess i should take off, then.

12
00:00:25,414 --> 00:00:26,644
Rachel was in the house.

13
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,371
<i>Her bed was unmade.</i>

14
00:00:28,491 --> 00:00:30,147
<i>She was there when it happened.</i>

15
00:00:30,282 --> 00:00:31,997
Not at a sleepover.

16
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,848
<i>We are none of us alone.</i>

17
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:42,199
<i>Even as we exhale,
it is inhaled by others.</i>

18
00:00:46,599 --> 00:00:48,241
<i>The light that shines upon me</i>

19
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:50,764
<i>Shines upon my neighbor as well.</i>

20
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:54,868
<i>In this way,</i>

21
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:57,735
<i>everything is connected
to everything else.</i>

22
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:02,706
<i>In this way,</i>

23
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,833
<i>I am connected to my friend</i>

24
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,132
<i>even as i am connected to my enemy.</i>

25
00:01:08,732 --> 00:01:09,762
<i>In this way,</i>

26
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,125
<i>there is no difference between me</i>

27
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:13,584
<i>and my friend.</i>

28
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:17,062
<i>In this way,</i>

29
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,720
<i>there is no difference between me</i>

30
00:01:19,841 --> 00:01:20,843
<i>and my enemy.</i>

31
00:01:21,835 --> 00:01:23,581
<i>We are none of us alone.</i>

32
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:30,239
How come you only call me
when someone's dead?

33
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:37,113
Where's all the furniture?

34
00:01:37,313 --> 00:01:38,913
Maybe this is all the furniture.

35
00:01:40,286 --> 00:01:41,489
He's in the kitchen.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,354
What's left of him.

37
00:01:57,778 --> 00:01:59,505
He must've been standing
at the fridge

38
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:01,349
with the door open
when the stove blew.

39
00:02:01,474 --> 00:02:04,569
The door protected his top half,
but the bottom half...

40
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,828
Vaporized.

41
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:07,464
Cut him right in two.

42
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:09,692
Accident or arson?

43
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:11,799
We'll know more
when we pull it apart.

44
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,991
You get a leak in one of these lines,
the gas builds up inside it.

45
00:02:15,126 --> 00:02:17,950
<i>Stove is just sitting there
like a grenade, waiting to blow.</i>

46
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,151
<i>All you need is one spark, and boom.</i>

47
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:23,283
Boom.

48
00:02:35,477 --> 00:02:36,899
Edward farthing.

49
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:40,737
That's him, but this house
isn't the address he's got listed here.

50
00:02:40,873 --> 00:02:41,977
I've got another one.

51
00:02:42,118 --> 00:02:44,000
- Another what?
- Another i. D.

52
00:02:46,538 --> 00:02:47,677
Joseph gale.

53
00:02:48,825 --> 00:02:49,830
That's him too.

54
00:02:50,512 --> 00:02:52,216
This one's got
another address listed.

55
00:03:34,412 --> 00:03:37,135
Why does this guy need two i. D. S?

56
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,348
Why did he need any i.D.?

57
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:41,191
Seems like he's hardly here at all.

58
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:44,460
Okay, let's just go check out
these addresses.

59
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:50,161
Yes, can i help you?

60
00:03:50,302 --> 00:03:52,394
Ma'am, my name is detective reese.

61
00:03:53,011 --> 00:03:54,120
What's happened?

62
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:57,455
Do you know an edward farthing?

63
00:04:02,054 --> 00:04:04,756
- May i help you?
- Ma'am, my name is detective crews.

64
00:04:05,232 --> 00:04:07,011
The police? Is something wrong?

65
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,960
Do you know a joseph gale?

66
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,670
Edward is my husband.
Why? What's happened?

67
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:14,462
Joseph is my husband.

68
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:16,416
Has something happened?

69
00:04:20,495 --> 00:04:21,790
I'm with the widow.

70
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:27,835
Funny you should say that.

71
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:34,063
Transcript: www.yyets.com
Synchro: Grischka

72
00:04:37,157 --> 00:04:38,806
There was a gas explosion.

73
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,444
Where?

74
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:44,369
In cheviot hills.

75
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,438
How long have you been married?

76
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:55,956
Five years.

77
00:04:56,707 --> 00:04:58,962
I met edward in mammoth, skiing.

78
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:01,106
Double black diamond.

79
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:14,397
He used to compete on the circuit.

80
00:05:15,037 --> 00:05:16,451
<i>He liked to go fast.</i>

81
00:05:17,256 --> 00:05:18,726
We both liked to go fast.

82
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:20,679
How did it happen?

83
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:22,712
There was a gas explosion.

84
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:25,763
- Where?
- In cheviot hills.

85
00:05:26,671 --> 00:05:27,511
Okay.

86
00:05:28,474 --> 00:05:29,498
I see.

87
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,956
Marissa, how long were you
and joseph married?

88
00:05:34,164 --> 00:05:35,266
Three years.

89
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:38,825
I met joseph at...

90
00:05:39,277 --> 00:05:41,448
The richard serra retrospective.

91
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,184
He explained the beauty

92
00:05:43,318 --> 00:05:47,171
of the oxidation process
to me in a way that...

93
00:05:48,253 --> 00:05:49,741
it made me cry.

94
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:51,475
Oxidation?

95
00:05:52,276 --> 00:05:53,415
You mean rust?

96
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,499
If you will.

97
00:05:55,624 --> 00:05:58,100
But you should've heard joseph
speak about it.

98
00:05:58,765 --> 00:06:00,672
We lived a life of the mind.

99
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:02,350
Elena?

100
00:06:02,476 --> 00:06:04,976
May i ask what your husband
did for a living?

101
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:08,620
What did joseph do for a living?

102
00:06:09,573 --> 00:06:11,514
I'm not sure i can tell you that.

103
00:06:12,217 --> 00:06:15,354
But it doesn't surprise me
that it finally killed him.

104
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:18,196
Why won't you tell me what
your husband did for a living?

105
00:06:18,624 --> 00:06:21,238
I suppose now that he's dead
it's okay.

106
00:06:21,862 --> 00:06:24,290
You'll find out soon anyways.
I'm sure they'll tell you.

107
00:06:24,846 --> 00:06:26,740
Joseph worked for
the government, you see.

108
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,225
What branch of the government
was it that he worked for?

109
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:32,195
He wasn't allowed to tell me
what he did. That's how secret it was.

110
00:06:32,318 --> 00:06:35,649
Are you saying that your husband
was some sort of government agent?

111
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:36,705
Yes.

112
00:06:36,825 --> 00:06:39,415
Must've been difficult,
living with such a secret man.

113
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:40,538
It was.

114
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,180
Because of his...

115
00:06:43,365 --> 00:06:44,379
his job,

116
00:06:44,743 --> 00:06:48,369
he would have to go away
for long periods of time.

117
00:06:48,503 --> 00:06:50,872
And there were phone calls
in the middle of the night.

118
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,059
They left him very upset sometimes.

119
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:56,099
You must have worried for his safety.

120
00:06:56,226 --> 00:06:57,553
I worried all the time.

121
00:06:57,897 --> 00:06:59,858
<i>But it was for the good
of the country.</i>

122
00:06:59,981 --> 00:07:02,041
The sacrifice i made
by my husband being absent

123
00:07:02,161 --> 00:07:03,580
Was nothing compared...

124
00:07:05,109 --> 00:07:06,620
compared to what it...

125
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,423
<i>But it wasn't just the time away.</i>

126
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:15,281
It made him forgetful.

127
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,901
And confused, and...

128
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,290
sometimes...

129
00:07:21,695 --> 00:07:24,324
sometimes he forgot where he was.

130
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,046
And who he was.

131
00:07:27,177 --> 00:07:28,990
You must have loved him very much.

132
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:30,372
I did.

133
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:32,993
He was kind,

134
00:07:33,113 --> 00:07:34,194
generous.

135
00:07:35,276 --> 00:07:36,327
He was funny.

136
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:37,834
and...

137
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:39,807
gentle.

138
00:07:40,563 --> 00:07:42,734
He did what no other man...

139
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:45,232
i've ever met did.

140
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:46,910
What was that?

141
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:48,290
He listened to me.

142
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,004
He listened to me.

143
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:54,919
When can i claim my husband's body?

144
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,620
Soon.

145
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,462
Okay, on the long shot
that he is some kind of agent,

146
00:08:05,582 --> 00:08:07,656
Let's send his prints
to the government database.

147
00:08:07,798 --> 00:08:10,542
Well, expect a "neither confirm
nor deny the existence of" letter.

148
00:08:11,937 --> 00:08:14,346
Okay, so we have one dead guy
married to two women.

149
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:16,394
- Half a dead guy.
- Half a dead guy.

150
00:08:16,514 --> 00:08:18,466
If either wife found out about
the other one,

151
00:08:18,593 --> 00:08:19,983
that'd be cause for murder.

152
00:08:20,103 --> 00:08:21,630
<i>If both of them found out,</i>

153
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,372
Maybe they killed him together.

154
00:08:23,883 --> 00:08:26,193
- That's your theory?
- It makes sense.

155
00:08:26,322 --> 00:08:28,311
Yeah, that's why i'm surprised
it's your theory.

156
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:29,883
What did you expect me to say?

157
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:33,005
That they seemed like
they both loved him.

158
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:36,036
Marissa seemed like she did.

159
00:08:36,436 --> 00:08:38,282
And from what you say, so did elena.

160
00:08:38,413 --> 00:08:41,121
They didn't seem like the kind
of women that could kill someone.

161
00:08:41,785 --> 00:08:43,328
Well, marissa didn't seem it.

162
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:45,623
And from what you say,
neither did elena.

163
00:08:46,163 --> 00:08:48,243
But you still think
they're good for it.

164
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,805
Do you want to know what
the chinese symbol for "war" is?

165
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:53,315
Just when i thought i was
at the part where i'd get an answer.

166
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:55,358
- I don't have to tell you.
- No, tell me. What{\, crews, what}?

167
00:08:55,478 --> 00:08:57,383
- Not if you don't want me to.
- No, please{\, crews}.

168
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:59,513
Tell me what the chinese
symbol for "war" is.

169
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:01,599
The chinese symbol for "war"...

170
00:09:02,322 --> 00:09:04,009
is two women under one roof.

171
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,773
He told both wives he was
a secret government agent?

172
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:13,410
Guess if you're gonna lie, lie big.

173
00:09:13,535 --> 00:09:16,017
When we told the wives where he died,
they didn't believe it.

174
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,706
Like cheviot hills was some kind
of agency cover-Up.

175
00:09:19,678 --> 00:09:21,158
Both wives have alibis.

176
00:09:21,552 --> 00:09:22,889
Marissa was at her gallery.

177
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:25,304
Elena was at an indoor
rock climbing class.

178
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:27,977
We can't find any record of either
of them knowing each other.

179
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,425
Or knowing about each other.

180
00:09:29,558 --> 00:09:31,188
We canvassed every house
on the block.

181
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:33,107
Showed pictures of both women.

182
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:34,903
No one remembers
seeing either of them.

183
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,296
Who lives like this?

184
00:09:49,482 --> 00:09:51,040
Everything all right?

185
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:53,572
Imagine being married
to two different women.

186
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:54,969
Okay, i'll play.

187
00:09:58,356 --> 00:09:59,572
Are they hot?

188
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:02,458
Yeah, i guess so.

189
00:10:11,418 --> 00:10:13,588
- You're imagining it, aren't you?
- Yes.

190
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:15,062
As it turns out, i am.

191
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:17,020
How's it working out for you?

192
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,377
Not so bad.

193
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,534
Not so bad until the part where
they blow you up with the stove.

194
00:10:22,826 --> 00:10:24,860
I... don't know what that means.

195
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:27,331
You tell each of them
a different lie.

196
00:10:27,777 --> 00:10:30,210
Well, don't all husbands
lie to their wives?

197
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:32,736
When i was married,
all i ever did was lie.

198
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,092
Didn't you?

199
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:35,133
No.

200
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,449
- What did you lie about?
- Well, you... you know.

201
00:10:38,635 --> 00:10:40,966
About the girls, and...

202
00:10:41,143 --> 00:10:42,897
what happened on the private jets.

203
00:10:43,548 --> 00:10:46,260
And what happened with the girls
on the private jets.

204
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,838
No, this guy didn't lie like that.

205
00:10:51,572 --> 00:10:53,568
He didn't lie to be away from them.

206
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:55,556
He lied to be with them.

207
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,598
Maybe we should get
some furniture in here.

208
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:08,155
Report came back from arson.

209
00:11:08,282 --> 00:11:09,815
The pilot light was rigged.

210
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:11,623
Someone turned that stove
into shrapnel.

211
00:11:11,752 --> 00:11:14,882
The phone logs on the wives
show no contact between them.

212
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:19,554
Davis.

213
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:25,285
We've got an officer down.

214
00:11:25,415 --> 00:11:26,457
Where?

215
00:11:26,596 --> 00:11:29,309
Right here in the building's
parking structure.

216
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,138
Excuse me. Thank you.

217
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,141
<i>Wasn't there another suspect
in the seybolt killings?</i>

218
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:03,519
Are you removing me from duty?

219
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,410
The lead detective on the case
that sent you to prison for 12 years

220
00:12:06,532 --> 00:12:07,923
Just turned up shot to death.

221
00:12:08,886 --> 00:12:10,790
I was sitting here with you
when it happened.

222
00:12:10,924 --> 00:12:12,826
That doesn't mean
you weren't involved.

223
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:14,270
Do you think i was involved?

224
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,356
If this were your case,
would you be a suspect?

225
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:17,735
If this were my case?

226
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:20,826
I'd be right at the top of my list.

227
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,147
Are you removing me from duty?

228
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,103
No.

229
00:12:25,514 --> 00:12:27,158
But expect a visit from i.A.D.

230
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:28,969
I always do.

231
00:12:31,124 --> 00:12:32,331
Detective?

232
00:12:33,698 --> 00:12:36,183
I am going to be handling
this case personally.

233
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:52,791
You still have your gun and badge.

234
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:55,964
Yeah, but if you're looking
to get reassigned to a new partner,

235
00:12:56,099 --> 00:12:57,429
Now is probably the moment.

236
00:13:01,741 --> 00:13:03,813
We got a hit
off of half-Man's prints.

237
00:13:04,226 --> 00:13:06,137
His name was rudolph farthingale.

238
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:07,673
Farthingale?

239
00:13:08,467 --> 00:13:10,534
Edward farthing, joseph gale.

240
00:13:10,678 --> 00:13:11,696
Farthingale.

241
00:13:11,816 --> 00:13:13,588
Came off the government database.

242
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,530
- He did work for the government.
- Yeah.

243
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:18,660
But not exactly as a spy.

244
00:13:21,937 --> 00:13:24,041
Rudolph farthingale worked
for the i.R.S.?

245
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:25,333
Yep.

246
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:29,072
Looks like we just opened up
our field of suspects.

247
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:31,774
I mean, who doesn't want
to kill the taxman, right?

248
00:13:32,637 --> 00:13:34,382
How long did mr. Farthingale
work here?

249
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,538
12 years.

250
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:38,374
Did he ever talk
about his personal life?

251
00:13:38,507 --> 00:13:40,285
No, he kept to himself. But...

252
00:13:40,443 --> 00:13:43,557
i always had a feeling he lived
a very tame home life.

253
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,001
He was just so...

254
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:47,841
<i>- Ordinary?</i>
- Yes

255
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,990
He was the most ordinary man
i think i've ever met.

256
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,164
<i>And shy.</i>

257
00:13:52,284 --> 00:13:54,225
<i>He could hardly look a woman
in the eye.</i>

258
00:13:54,345 --> 00:13:55,786
He didn't have a wife, did he?

259
00:13:55,933 --> 00:13:57,505
<i>No, he didn't have a wife.</i>

260
00:14:00,115 --> 00:14:01,954
Has this always been his cubicle?

261
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:02,973
<i>Yes.</i>

262
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:09,228
Has it been cleaned lately?

263
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,258
No, no.

264
00:14:10,378 --> 00:14:12,601
Mr. Farthingale always
kept it like this.

265
00:14:12,736 --> 00:14:13,925
He was very exact.

266
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:15,164
No photos?

267
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:16,288
Nothing personal.

268
00:14:17,485 --> 00:14:18,869
What was his job here?

269
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,847
Mr. Farthingale was in tax evasion.

270
00:14:20,975 --> 00:14:22,878
He'd go after people
who didn't pay their taxes?

271
00:14:23,005 --> 00:14:25,514
Go after? No.
We have field agents for that.

272
00:14:25,634 --> 00:14:28,371
Mr. Farthingale
would scan and collate records,

273
00:14:28,491 --> 00:14:30,185
Identify non-Taxpaying citizens,

274
00:14:30,325 --> 00:14:32,153
And then flag them
for the field agents.

275
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:33,730
He never left his cubicle?

276
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,360
He seemed to like it that way.

277
00:14:35,481 --> 00:14:38,356
Well, we'll need a list of the people
that he identified as tax evaders.

278
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:39,612
And why would you want that?

279
00:14:39,732 --> 00:14:41,580
Maybe one of them
killed mr Farthingale.

280
00:14:41,704 --> 00:14:43,651
Taxman isn't exactly
a well-Liked figure.

281
00:14:44,163 --> 00:14:45,388
That would be impossible.

282
00:14:45,513 --> 00:14:47,166
Impossible for one of them
to kill him?

283
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,541
Impossible for one of them
to even know who he was.

284
00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:52,877
Mr. Farthingale was assigned
an identification number.

285
00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:55,413
That's what appears in the reports,
not his name.

286
00:14:59,845 --> 00:15:01,265
Just a number.

287
00:15:27,654 --> 00:15:29,177
Detective crews.

288
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,481
I.A.D.?

289
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:33,972
No, no. Not exactly.

290
00:15:34,771 --> 00:15:35,974
John garrity.

291
00:15:36,624 --> 00:15:37,968
I'm your union rep.

292
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,915
<i>I just came by to talk
to your lieutenant,</i>

293
00:15:40,043 --> 00:15:41,721
But i thought i'd introduce myself.

294
00:15:42,496 --> 00:15:44,948
- Good to meet you, john.
- Yeah, you too.

295
00:15:45,074 --> 00:15:47,101
I'll be with you
when you're in with i.A.D.

296
00:15:47,227 --> 00:15:48,235
Yeah, okay.

297
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,228
You can also have a lawyer
if you want one.

298
00:15:50,348 --> 00:15:52,720
- My lawyer's out of town.
- We can get you another one.

299
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:54,506
No, i think i'll be okay.

300
00:15:55,575 --> 00:15:56,597
Listen.

301
00:15:57,385 --> 00:15:58,548
Off the record,

302
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,729
Some guy puts me away for 12 years,

303
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:03,276
I'd take him out too.

304
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:06,461
But i think i'd wanna do it myself.

305
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:31,913
<i>Hi, it's constance.
Please leave a message.</i>

306
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,282
Hey, connie.
I know you're in new york.

307
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:36,924
But you know that guy you told me
to stay away from?

308
00:16:37,422 --> 00:16:38,841
He ended up dead.

309
00:16:39,537 --> 00:16:40,890
So call me, okay?

310
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:51,336
Do you want to know if i was involved
in ames'death or not?

311
00:16:51,965 --> 00:16:52,898
No.

312
00:16:53,975 --> 00:16:55,779
My union rep said

313
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:57,644
He wouldn't blame me if i did do it.

314
00:16:57,771 --> 00:16:58,919
He said that, did he?

315
00:16:59,046 --> 00:17:00,205
Off the record.

316
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:02,447
Then i guess it doesn't count.

317
00:17:02,567 --> 00:17:04,049
I'd rather not go back to prison.

318
00:17:04,665 --> 00:17:06,094
I can understand that.

319
00:17:09,037 --> 00:17:10,258
Rudolph farthingale.

320
00:17:10,794 --> 00:17:13,261
Born in shaker heights, ohio, 1973,

321
00:17:13,682 --> 00:17:16,103
"B" studenent in high school,
"b" student in college,

322
00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:18,543
Got an 83% on his civil service exam.

323
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,150
No criminal record.

324
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,352
No speeding tickets.

325
00:17:22,225 --> 00:17:23,536
No parking tickets.

326
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:28,303
Worked in tax evasion processing
for the i.R.S. Since 1995.

327
00:17:28,953 --> 00:17:30,599
Yeah, he was a real bland guy.

328
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:33,156
Except for the fact
that he had two wives

329
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:36,151
And he ended up getting fragged
by an exploding kitchen oven.

330
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:47,790
Do you think he felt any pain?

331
00:17:48,253 --> 00:17:49,552
I wouldn't think so.

332
00:17:59,017 --> 00:18:01,139
And this was some kind of safe house?

333
00:18:03,126 --> 00:18:04,650
Is that what they call it?

334
00:18:06,701 --> 00:18:07,753
Hello.

335
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,496
Elena.

336
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,525
This is marissa gale.

337
00:18:13,645 --> 00:18:15,335
Marissa, this is elena farthing.

338
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,078
May i ask why we're here?

339
00:18:19,776 --> 00:18:20,903
Yes, what's going on?

340
00:18:22,273 --> 00:18:23,115
Well...

341
00:18:25,101 --> 00:18:27,176
marissa's husband
was killed yesterday.

342
00:18:29,178 --> 00:18:30,182
<i>Killed here.</i>

343
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,789
I'm so sorry.

344
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:33,167
My husband--

345
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:37,316
He was killed yesterday too.

346
00:18:37,874 --> 00:18:39,312
Is that why we're here together?

347
00:18:40,058 --> 00:18:41,866
<i>Did they work together at--</i>

348
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:44,694
Well, at that place
my husband worked?

349
00:18:44,814 --> 00:18:46,520
Your husband worked there too?

350
00:18:47,507 --> 00:18:48,380
<i>Ladies,</i>

351
00:18:48,506 --> 00:18:50,131
Both your husbands were...

352
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:51,880
killed here.

353
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:54,166
Yesterday at the same time.

354
00:18:54,637 --> 00:18:55,555
But...

355
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,299
But what, detective?

356
00:18:59,902 --> 00:19:02,158
There was only one person here.

357
00:19:04,902 --> 00:19:07,640
How could there have been
only one person here?

358
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:21,383
Did your husband have
to suddenly go out of town

359
00:19:21,513 --> 00:19:22,710
<i>For a week or two?</i>

360
00:19:23,342 --> 00:19:25,307
Did your husband
get strange phone calls

361
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:26,756
in the middle of the night?

362
00:19:27,154 --> 00:19:28,843
Sometimes forget where he was?

363
00:19:28,983 --> 00:19:30,692
Sometimes forget who he was?

364
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:34,631
- Are you saying--
- We were both married--

365
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:35,949
To--

366
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:37,853
To the same man.

367
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:39,601
Yes.

368
00:19:43,242 --> 00:19:44,331
He wasn't a spy.

369
00:19:44,813 --> 00:19:45,992
He was a fraud.

370
00:19:46,124 --> 00:19:48,068
But i believed him.

371
00:19:48,212 --> 00:19:50,601
I... waiting up for him

372
00:19:50,727 --> 00:19:52,791
Because he was working on a big case.

373
00:19:52,913 --> 00:19:54,348
Yeah, he told you that too?

374
00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:56,243
How he was tracking someone?

375
00:19:56,379 --> 00:20:00,264
How he was not looking
for the person not obeying the law.

376
00:20:00,384 --> 00:20:02,116
<i>No, that's not what he said.</i>

377
00:20:02,247 --> 00:20:04,731
He said he was looking for the
person not not obeying the law.

378
00:20:04,851 --> 00:20:05,936
<i>Joseph said</i>

379
00:20:06,056 --> 00:20:09,523
He was not looking for the person
not obeying the law.

380
00:20:09,657 --> 00:20:12,314
Edward said he was looking for
the person not not obeying the law.

381
00:20:12,474 --> 00:20:13,523
Ladies...

382
00:20:14,477 --> 00:20:17,861
his real name
was rudolph farthingale.

383
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:20,104
He worked at the i.R.S.

384
00:20:21,476 --> 00:20:22,294
I...

385
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:23,547
i...

386
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,170
i don't think i have
a reaction for this.

387
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,198
I do.

388
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:30,890
I'm going home and smash
everything he owned.

389
00:20:43,694 --> 00:20:46,676
He was not looking for
the person not obeying the law.

390
00:20:46,882 --> 00:20:49,450
He was looking for the person
not not obeying the law.

391
00:20:50,942 --> 00:20:53,330
That kind of talk remind you
of anyone?

392
00:20:53,565 --> 00:20:55,088
Rudolph farthingale

393
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,557
Wanted to be a spy so badly.

394
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:01,539
Don't you think?

395
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,814
He stumbled upon something, someone,

396
00:21:05,941 --> 00:21:08,111
- that got him killed?
- Or...

397
00:21:09,178 --> 00:21:10,965
Was he just one of those people

398
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:12,977
that sees conspiraces everywhere.

399
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:32,851
This is what we were afraid of.

400
00:21:32,975 --> 00:21:34,476
When we partnered you with crews,

401
00:21:34,602 --> 00:21:36,624
i asked you to help me
get him removed from duty.

402
00:21:36,749 --> 00:21:38,736
For his own good,
and for the department's good.

403
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:40,204
Yeah, i remember that.

404
00:21:43,018 --> 00:21:44,638
He's done
some good police work, dani.

405
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:45,804
I won't deny that.

406
00:21:45,927 --> 00:21:46,929
But here we are.

407
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:49,290
We were afraid crews was back
to get even.

408
00:21:49,432 --> 00:21:50,744
Now ames is dead.

409
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,792
<i>He's not gonna let himself
go back to prison.</i>

410
00:21:53,927 --> 00:21:56,002
<i>He's capable of anything now.</i>

411
00:21:57,046 --> 00:21:58,500
He's got nothing to lose.

412
00:22:17,078 --> 00:22:18,144
Connie.

413
00:22:19,994 --> 00:22:21,753
You really should lock your door.

414
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,169
Well, some doors i lock,
and some i don't.

415
00:22:27,354 --> 00:22:28,793
So you got my message?

416
00:22:29,207 --> 00:22:30,209
About ames?

417
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:32,187
Already knew.
The d. A.'S office told me.

418
00:22:32,314 --> 00:22:33,962
They told you
because you're my lawyer?

419
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:36,101
I'm not your lawyer anymore, charlie.

420
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,624
I know.
I know what we said, but...

421
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:41,082
i.A.D. Told me to get a lawyer.

422
00:22:41,261 --> 00:22:43,292
Who else am i gonna trust
on this, connie?

423
00:22:44,401 --> 00:22:46,750
The d. A.'S office told me last week.

424
00:22:47,615 --> 00:22:49,211
But ames died yesterday.

425
00:22:50,845 --> 00:22:52,629
They called me about a job.

426
00:22:52,749 --> 00:22:53,602
You?

427
00:22:53,984 --> 00:22:55,498
Working for the d. A.?

428
00:22:57,363 --> 00:22:58,407
I took it.

429
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,576
Well, they've been after you
for years. Why now?

430
00:23:02,701 --> 00:23:04,854
Because. The cudahy thing got to me.

431
00:23:04,974 --> 00:23:07,312
Because most of my clients
aren't like you, charlie.

432
00:23:07,435 --> 00:23:09,250
Most of my clients,
the high-Priced ones

433
00:23:09,373 --> 00:23:11,784
The firm assigned me, they're guilty.

434
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:13,783
How does your husband feel

435
00:23:13,906 --> 00:23:15,762
About coming back
from new york early?

436
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:18,409
My husband is gonna
stay there for a while.

437
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:19,693
He needs it.

438
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:20,879
We both need it.

439
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,817
Why are you here, connie?

440
00:23:23,608 --> 00:23:26,191
Because i start with
the d. A.'S office tomorrow.

441
00:23:27,336 --> 00:23:28,794
And the next time i see you,

442
00:23:28,914 --> 00:23:30,871
It'll be on official business, so...

443
00:23:32,325 --> 00:23:34,219
i need you to listen to me, charlie.

444
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:35,977
Okay?

445
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:40,478
The d.A.'S office wants you
really bad for ames'death.

446
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,371
And you just--
You need to watch yourself.

447
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:47,916
And you really should lock your door.

448
00:23:55,536 --> 00:23:56,854
What'd she mean,

449
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,097
You need to watch yourself?

450
00:24:00,346 --> 00:24:02,463
A week before ames died,

451
00:24:03,423 --> 00:24:06,071
The d. A. Took my lawyer from me.

452
00:24:10,004 --> 00:24:12,223
Initial internal affairs inquiry

453
00:24:12,348 --> 00:24:14,613
with charles crews, detective, lapd.

454
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:16,540
Detective crews,

455
00:24:16,842 --> 00:24:19,139
what were your feelings
towards carl ames?

456
00:24:19,378 --> 00:24:22,025
My feelings toward ames were the same
as my feelings toward anyone.

457
00:24:22,163 --> 00:24:23,480
And that would be?

458
00:24:23,938 --> 00:24:25,652
That none of us are alone.

459
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:28,316
That even as we exhale,
it is inhaled by others.

460
00:24:29,352 --> 00:24:31,015
Is that some kind of joke?

461
00:24:32,068 --> 00:24:34,027
Well, laughter is the best medicine.

462
00:24:36,788 --> 00:24:38,168
<i>Reader's digest.</i>

463
00:24:39,242 --> 00:24:41,216
I had a subscription at pelican bay.

464
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:43,041
Detective crews,

465
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:45,350
you were seen arguing
in a bar with ames.

466
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,293
Would that be connected to his death?

467
00:24:47,413 --> 00:24:50,205
The light that shines upon me
shines upon my neighbor as well.

468
00:24:50,817 --> 00:24:52,430
What is that supposed to mean?

469
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:57,752
That in this way, everything
is connected to everything else.

470
00:25:09,033 --> 00:25:12,267
Who did he piss off
to get himself killed like that?

471
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:14,658
Farthingale.

472
00:25:14,793 --> 00:25:16,292
<i>Someone rigged his stove.</i>

473
00:25:16,412 --> 00:25:17,753
Someone wanted him dead bad.

474
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:19,949
Someone's still out there.

475
00:25:21,203 --> 00:25:23,433
You still got your head
in the farthingale case?

476
00:25:23,553 --> 00:25:25,087
- I do.
- <i>Okay.</i>

477
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:26,241
So...

478
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,638
What's your head thinking?

479
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:30,858
My head is thinking
that we need to know more

480
00:25:30,978 --> 00:25:32,866
about what farthingale's head
was thinking.

481
00:25:32,997 --> 00:25:34,257
But how do we do that?

482
00:25:34,377 --> 00:25:36,815
No one knew him.
It was just farthing and gale.

483
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,174
Farthingale split himself in two.

484
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:41,022
Let's put him back together.

485
00:25:42,629 --> 00:25:44,277
We know his wives didn't do it.

486
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,318
Maybe they could tell us who did.

487
00:25:46,925 --> 00:25:49,140
Okay, so... what are we looking for?

488
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:50,699
The points of connection.

489
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:53,630
And what would those look like?

490
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,771
<i>Gale was here,</i>

491
00:25:54,898 --> 00:25:56,106
Farthing was there.

492
00:25:56,231 --> 00:25:57,918
But farthingale was also
in both places.

493
00:25:58,038 --> 00:25:59,349
We need to find farthingale.

494
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:01,513
So we're not looking for
how they were different.

495
00:26:01,635 --> 00:26:03,357
We're looking
for how they were the same.

496
00:26:03,477 --> 00:26:05,830
We find that, we find farthingale.

497
00:26:06,346 --> 00:26:08,575
What kind of music
did joseph listen to?

498
00:26:08,695 --> 00:26:09,938
Modern jazz.

499
00:26:10,743 --> 00:26:12,542
What kind of music did edward like?

500
00:26:12,662 --> 00:26:13,684
Classic rock.

501
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:16,055
What kind of tv did he watch?

502
00:26:16,197 --> 00:26:17,293
Sports mostly.

503
00:26:17,731 --> 00:26:19,425
Oh, joseph never watched tv.

504
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:21,949
Scrambled.

505
00:26:22,076 --> 00:26:23,076
Poached.

506
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:24,004
Flat.

507
00:26:24,139 --> 00:26:25,161
Sparkling.

508
00:26:25,963 --> 00:26:26,977
Top.

509
00:26:27,104 --> 00:26:28,230
Bottom.

510
00:26:28,357 --> 00:26:29,777
- Boxers.
- Briefs.

511
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,152
Right side of the bed.

512
00:26:31,274 --> 00:26:32,475
Left side of the bed.

513
00:26:32,601 --> 00:26:33,980
But he was a light sleeper.

514
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,517
But he was a light sleeper.

515
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,000
And what did he used to do
when he couldn't sleep?

516
00:26:40,143 --> 00:26:41,643
He would sit in that chair.

517
00:26:42,542 --> 00:26:44,118
Just sre and stare.

518
00:26:44,252 --> 00:26:45,434
Almost meditating.

519
00:26:45,586 --> 00:26:47,253
Which chair would he sit in?

520
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:48,474
That one.

521
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:49,888
He'd just sit and stare.

522
00:26:50,011 --> 00:26:51,330
Totally zoning out (????).

523
00:27:08,028 --> 00:27:09,167
What do you see?

524
00:27:10,556 --> 00:27:11,666
<i>A fireplace.</i>

525
00:27:11,803 --> 00:27:13,362
What else do you see?

526
00:27:15,674 --> 00:27:18,150
<i>A picture of farthingale and elena.</i>

527
00:27:23,423 --> 00:27:24,646
A model boat.

528
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:29,912
A duck decoy.

529
00:27:30,052 --> 00:27:31,387
A fishing pole.

530
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,182
Five baseball caps.

531
00:27:37,336 --> 00:27:39,210
How many?
How many caps?

532
00:27:39,338 --> 00:27:40,851
Five. Why?

533
00:27:40,981 --> 00:27:42,133
What do you see?

534
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:46,028
Five bottles of wine.

535
00:27:51,688 --> 00:27:52,872
Anything?

536
00:27:57,393 --> 00:27:59,249
You got two national pastimes.

537
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:01,469
Baseball and drinking.

538
00:28:03,954 --> 00:28:06,560
This is what he liked to do
when he couldn't sleep.

539
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:09,652
When you can't sleep,
what do you think about?

540
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:11,809
I don't have a problem sleeping.

541
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:12,970
Work.

542
00:28:13,129 --> 00:28:15,091
When i can't sleep,
i think about work.

543
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,772
He worked for the i.R.S.

544
00:28:17,931 --> 00:28:20,384
Farthingale worked for the i.R.S.

545
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,388
<i>Farthing and gale were spies.</i>

546
00:28:23,514 --> 00:28:26,649
And they would sit here
and meditate on these objects.

547
00:28:27,192 --> 00:28:28,245
All right.

548
00:28:28,795 --> 00:28:31,097
Five baseball caps
from minor league teams.

549
00:28:31,658 --> 00:28:33,354
And five bottles of wine.

550
00:28:33,821 --> 00:28:35,010
This is ridiculous.

551
00:28:35,402 --> 00:28:36,722
This is what he did.

552
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,087
You see something, don't you?

553
00:28:45,272 --> 00:28:46,922
No, it's ridiculous.

554
00:28:49,681 --> 00:28:51,748
What are the years on those bottles?

555
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:55,536
'93,'97,

556
00:28:55,658 --> 00:28:58,117
<i>'99, 2002, and 2004.</i>

557
00:28:58,783 --> 00:29:00,364
That's really odd.

558
00:29:00,491 --> 00:29:02,138
<i>1993...</i>

559
00:29:03,504 --> 00:29:05,308
bakersfield post office.

00:29:05,433 --> 00:29:09,106
1997... lancaster police station.

561
00:29:09,227 --> 00:29:11,248
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, 1999...

562
00:29:11,385 --> 00:29:12,941
<i>modesto--</i>

563
00:29:13,073 --> 00:29:14,393

- Courthouse.

2002,

565
00:29:15,591 --> 00:29:16,960
Stockton hall of records.

566
00:29:17,085 --> 00:29:18,139
2004--

567
00:29:18,266 --> 00:29:19,699
Visalia city hall.

568
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,985
Those are the years
these places were bombed.

569
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,555
Free state bombings.

570
00:29:24,691 --> 00:29:26,806
- Free state bombings?
- Oh, you have been away.

571
00:29:26,951 --> 00:29:28,139
Free state. He's a--

572
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:30,098
He's an antigovernment whack job.

573
00:29:30,243 --> 00:29:31,642
<i>He calls himself free state.</i>

574
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,158
<i>Pulls a bombing every few years</i>

575
00:29:33,281 --> 00:29:34,799
And then he goes back into hiding.

576
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:36,076
Never been caught.

577
00:29:36,225 --> 00:29:37,230
Until now.

578
00:29:37,626 --> 00:29:39,077
<i>You think this i.R.S. Clerk,</i>

579
00:29:39,197 --> 00:29:42,639
Rudolph farthingale, did what hundreds
of federal agents have failed to do?

580
00:29:43,226 --> 00:29:44,772
Free state was a bomber.

581
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:47,662
Someone blew up farthingale's stove.

582
00:29:54,249 --> 00:29:56,150
Let me have those years, please.

583
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,762
1993,'97,

584
00:29:57,905 --> 00:29:59,190
<i>'99,</i>

585
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,709
2002, and 2004.

586
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:05,891
Nothing. There's no entry
in mr. Farthingale's

587
00:30:06,021 --> 00:30:08,614
Tax evasion files that have
those dates as a key.

588
00:30:08,763 --> 00:30:10,030
What did the wives say?

589
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,210
<i>He was not looking for someone
not obeying the law?</i>

590
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,406
He was looking for the guy
not not obeying the law.

591
00:30:16,972 --> 00:30:19,586
He was not looking for the guy
not obeying the law.

592
00:30:19,712 --> 00:30:21,539
Will he... just keep saying that?

593
00:30:24,938 --> 00:30:27,817
Was farthingale tracking someone
who was paying their taxes?

594
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:29,188
Well, i can't imagine why

595
00:30:29,314 --> 00:30:31,380
<i>He would track someone
who was paying his taxes.</i>

596
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,154
Could you check anyway for me?

597
00:30:34,164 --> 00:30:37,174
He was not not obeying the law.

598
00:30:37,925 --> 00:30:40,305
He was not not paying his taxes.

599
00:30:40,437 --> 00:30:43,250
Free state lives off the grid,
but he comes back on every few years.

600
00:30:43,376 --> 00:30:45,653
<i>Pays taxes when he needs
to earn money,</i>

601
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,592
Rent cars, buy supplies.

602
00:30:47,734 --> 00:30:48,746
Nothing.

603
00:30:49,818 --> 00:30:51,716
But if you wanted to establish credit

604
00:30:51,844 --> 00:30:53,983
in a certain year,
you'd have to file taxes

605
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:55,259
The year before.

606
00:30:55,382 --> 00:30:57,958
So we should check
one year before each attack.

607
00:30:58,083 --> 00:31:00,595
'92,'96,'98,

608
00:31:01,314 --> 00:31:02,770
<i>'01,'03.</i>

609
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:07,836
Leonard slatz.

610
00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:10,170
<i>Mr. Slatz is not a tax evader.</i>

611
00:31:10,313 --> 00:31:12,125
I mean, not consistently so.

612
00:31:12,257 --> 00:31:15,147
<i>He won't pay taxes for a few years,
and then he'll file</i>

613
00:31:15,281 --> 00:31:17,138
And then he won't pay again.

614
00:31:18,856 --> 00:31:21,978
That's why he wasn't listed
in mr. Farthingale's evasion file.

615
00:31:22,105 --> 00:31:24,119
<i>He was not not paying.</i>

616
00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:27,323
How would farthingale get hold
of something like this?

617
00:31:27,443 --> 00:31:31,002
Oh, you would have to look for
some kind of a statistical anomaly

618
00:31:31,138 --> 00:31:33,099
Or something that didn't belong

619
00:31:33,222 --> 00:31:36,821
In the tax database,
but the patience to do that,

620
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,763
<i>It's thousands of hours.</i>

621
00:31:38,904 --> 00:31:41,000
Did slatz pay his taxes last year?

622
00:31:41,136 --> 00:31:42,223
Yes, he did.

623
00:31:42,353 --> 00:31:43,831
He's preparing for another attack.

624
00:31:43,962 --> 00:31:46,537
Do you have an address
listed for mr. Leonard slatz?

625
00:31:46,674 --> 00:31:49,043
Yes, but it's a post office box.

626
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:54,856
Okay.

627
00:31:55,683 --> 00:31:57,657
P.O. Box was emptied out
two days ago.

628
00:31:57,819 --> 00:31:59,744
Some creepy guy rolls up in an r. V.,

629
00:31:59,882 --> 00:32:02,274
closes out the account,
no forwarding address.

630
00:32:02,415 --> 00:32:04,430
Farthingale got close.

631
00:32:04,725 --> 00:32:05,931
- Hello.
- Charlie.

632
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,807
Hey, how was your first day
as a d. A.?

633
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:09,217
Go home.

634
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,582
- What?
<i>- Go home, charlie.</i>

635
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:13,095
Go home now.

636
00:32:23,696 --> 00:32:24,552
Hey!

637
00:32:24,691 --> 00:32:26,331
It's kind of like a party, except,

638
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:28,999
This is my house, and i don't remember
sending out the invites.

639
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:31,383
Detective crews, in that you're
a person of interest

640
00:32:31,503 --> 00:32:32,844
In the killing of carl ames,

641
00:32:33,021 --> 00:32:35,271
The district attorney's office
has issued a search warrant

642
00:32:35,403 --> 00:32:37,553
For these premises, as well as
the occupants therein.

643
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,427
Don't you wish
you could talk that way?

644
00:32:39,555 --> 00:32:41,252
They seem pretty serious, charlie.

645
00:32:41,382 --> 00:32:42,872
We are serious, detective,

646
00:32:42,998 --> 00:32:44,908
So let's just get this over with.

647
00:33:07,691 --> 00:33:08,872
It's locked.

648
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:10,492
Is it?

649
00:33:10,612 --> 00:33:11,758
Do you have a key?

650
00:33:12,193 --> 00:33:13,256
I had a key.

651
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,544
Do you knowhere is?

652
00:33:14,678 --> 00:33:16,063
Do you know what happened?

653
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,592
I left the key in there.

654
00:33:17,724 --> 00:33:20,019
<i>Then i locked the door
with the key inside, so.</i>

655
00:33:20,152 --> 00:33:22,197
In order to unlock the door,
i need to get the key,

656
00:33:22,317 --> 00:33:24,445
But i can't get the key
unless i unlock the door.

657
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:26,356
It's a puzzle.

658
00:33:27,859 --> 00:33:29,008
Break it down.

659
00:33:31,954 --> 00:33:33,444
****.

660
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:53,791
Let's go.

661
00:34:14,874 --> 00:34:16,068
You took it all?

662
00:34:17,126 --> 00:34:18,960
I was looking for porn.

663
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,317
Your lawyer called.

664
00:34:23,452 --> 00:34:25,698
Said the cops were coming
to serve a search warrant.

665
00:34:25,823 --> 00:34:28,049
If there was anything
you wouldn't want found...

666
00:34:28,511 --> 00:34:30,346
how did you get in the door?

667
00:34:32,032 --> 00:34:34,559
Charlie, you weren't the only one
to spend time in prison.

668
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,819
I learned some things in there too.

669
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:39,150
How did you know what was in there?

670
00:34:39,284 --> 00:34:40,759
I didn't exactly.

671
00:34:41,631 --> 00:34:44,220
But something else i learned
in prison, charlie:

672
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,925
****.

673
00:35:41,926 --> 00:35:42,948
Crews?

674
00:35:44,638 --> 00:35:45,697
Are you okay?

675
00:35:48,818 --> 00:35:51,548
The feds are gonna try to figure out
where free state is going next.

676
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,354
But edward farthing and joseph gale
already knew that.

677
00:35:54,498 --> 00:35:56,256
They followed him.
They got too close.

678
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:58,747
- And that's what got 'em killed.
- No. No.

679
00:35:58,873 --> 00:36:01,495
Crews, that's what got him killed.

680
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,012
There was no farthing.
There was no gale.

681
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,235
It was just one man. Farthingale.

682
00:36:06,923 --> 00:36:09,356
One person split in two.

683
00:36:10,508 --> 00:36:12,217
Both needing the same thing.

684
00:36:12,653 --> 00:36:14,103
Both needing to be a hero.

685
00:36:14,635 --> 00:36:16,737
Both needing to find slatz.

686
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:18,114
And both...

687
00:36:18,983 --> 00:36:20,298
both an i.R.S. Agent.

688
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:22,902
Both farthing and gale

689
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,714
saved all their receipts.

690
00:36:25,524 --> 00:36:28,214
So you find a place
where farthing and gale

691
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,739
both went.

692
00:36:29,966 --> 00:36:31,466
"You are what you receipt."

693
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,179
Both farthing and gale

694
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:39,966
ate over and over at this place.

695
00:36:40,093 --> 00:36:43,104
We wanna find slatz,
we follow farthing and gale.

696
00:36:44,255 --> 00:36:45,553
Dandy's fast foods?

697
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,893
<i>Yeah, i can't see
intellectual farthing</i>

698
00:36:48,017 --> 00:36:49,983
or health nut gale
eating at dandy's fast foods

699
00:36:50,106 --> 00:36:52,292
- for the food.
- So let's go see why they--

700
00:36:52,692 --> 00:36:55,145
why he went there.

701
00:36:55,269 --> 00:36:57,227
Well, we have one thing
farthingale didn't have

702
00:36:57,351 --> 00:36:58,711
When he went after slatz.

703
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,050
Yeah, what's that?

704
00:37:00,581 --> 00:37:02,031
Farthingale's death.

705
00:37:07,886 --> 00:37:10,875
What did the guy
at the post office box place say?

706
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:12,759
Some guy closed out
the account yesterday.

707
00:37:12,883 --> 00:37:14,191
And what was he driving?

708
00:37:17,472 --> 00:37:18,864
An r. V.

709
00:37:22,627 --> 00:37:23,593
Cops?

710
00:37:24,355 --> 00:37:26,539
We're detectives reese and crews.

711
00:37:26,675 --> 00:37:28,572
- We're looking for--
- Leonard slatz.

712
00:37:28,734 --> 00:37:30,096
That's right. Figures.

713
00:37:30,225 --> 00:37:31,412
Yeah? Why's that?

714
00:37:31,535 --> 00:37:33,365
Because that crackpot
was always going off

715
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:35,433
About the government this,
the government that.

716
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:38,287
Knew it was just a matter of time
before someone came to take him away.

717
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:39,576
- Is he here?
- Nope.

718
00:37:39,705 --> 00:37:41,750
Took off two days ago.
Left me with an empty slot

719
00:37:41,876 --> 00:37:43,857
and a month of unpaid rent
and utility fees.

720
00:37:43,986 --> 00:37:46,397
He did leave a few boxes behind.
You want me to go get 'em?

721
00:37:46,554 --> 00:37:47,377
No.

722
00:37:47,521 --> 00:37:49,746
No, i think it'd be better
if you let us go get 'em.

723
00:37:49,871 --> 00:37:51,639
Suit yourself. Come on back.

724
00:37:59,113 --> 00:38:00,547
<i>Right over here.</i>

725
00:38:18,113 --> 00:38:19,822
Reese, don't move!

726
00:38:25,964 --> 00:38:27,514
I think i'm gonna back away now.

727
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,801
Yeah, i think that'd be a good idea.

728
00:38:38,292 --> 00:38:39,321
Get down!

729
00:38:39,497 --> 00:38:40,928
Get down!

730
00:38:41,413 --> 00:38:42,669
I will shoot you.

731
00:38:43,425 --> 00:38:44,562
He wants to shoot you.

732
00:38:49,652 --> 00:38:50,833
<i>Leonard slatz,</i>

733
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:52,054
You're under arrest.

734
00:38:52,174 --> 00:38:53,815
For opposing an unjust government?

735
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,193
For asserting my naturally
given free will?

736
00:38:56,313 --> 00:38:58,088
No, you're under arrest
for the murder

737
00:38:58,219 --> 00:38:59,693
Of rudolph farthingale.

738
00:39:03,075 --> 00:39:04,596
He was one of us, leonard.

739
00:39:05,298 --> 00:39:07,665
We don't like it
when you kill one of us.

740
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:16,939
You know, i get that farthingale
was half physical, half intellectual.

741
00:39:17,866 --> 00:39:20,813
And farthing and gale,
the field agent, the analyst. But...

742
00:39:21,496 --> 00:39:22,578
Why two wives?

743
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,638
I guess neither of them
wanted to be alone.

744
00:39:30,784 --> 00:39:32,463
You're not going to ames'funeral?

745
00:39:32,597 --> 00:39:34,232
Probably not a good idea.

746
00:39:34,358 --> 00:39:35,490
Probably not.

747
00:39:35,867 --> 00:39:37,383
How are you holding up?

748
00:39:53,818 --> 00:39:54,880
'Bout ready?

749
00:39:55,898 --> 00:39:57,058
Yeah.

750
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,679
Crews, this is my father.

751
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,044
Jack reese.

752
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:06,679
Charlie crews.

753
00:40:07,036 --> 00:40:09,318
- Of course. I know who you are.
- Of course.

754
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:12,553
Let's go, dani.

755
00:40:12,678 --> 00:40:14,431
I don't wanna be late
for carl's funeral.

756
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,568
All right.

757
00:40:40,008 --> 00:40:41,910
<i>We are none of us alone.</i>

758
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,429
<i>Even as we exhale,</i>

759
00:40:43,565 --> 00:40:45,228
<i>it is inhaled by others.</i>

760
00:40:50,274 --> 00:40:52,354
<i>The light that shines upon me</i>

761
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,533
<i>shines upon my neighbor as well.</i>

762
00:40:58,441 --> 00:40:59,677
<i>In this way,</i>

763
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:02,430
<i>everything is connected
to everything else.</i>

764
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:05,994
<i>In this way,</i>

765
00:41:06,143 --> 00:41:08,032
<i>i am connected to my friend</i>

766
00:41:08,152 --> 00:41:10,446
<i>even as i am connected to my enemy.</i>

767
00:41:22,604 --> 00:41:24,567
<i>In this way, there is no difference</i>

768
00:41:24,703 --> 00:41:27,135
<i>between me and my friend.</i>

769
00:41:32,058 --> 00:41:35,810
<i>In this way, there is no difference
between me and my enemy</i>

770
00:41:36,009 --> 00:41:37,352
<i>and my enemy.</i>

771
00:41:50,643 --> 00:41:53,016
<i>We are none of us alone.</i>
