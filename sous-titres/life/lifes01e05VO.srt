<i>Now that Charlie Crews is free,</i>

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,100
<i>do you need
someone else to save ?</i>

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,500
It's not about what I need.

5
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,400
Do I feel bad
about what happened ?

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,800
Yeah, I feel bad.
Do I feel guilty ?

7
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,600
No.

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,900
I was looking for you,
and I didn't even know it.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,300
Now you're here,
and I can't have you.

10
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,900
You're married.

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,300
- Buy me a drink.
- Do I know you ?

12
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,400
Does it matter?

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,600
I'm Neil Cudahy.

14
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,300
You're the reason I'm sitting here.

15
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,200
Is that right ?

16
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,400
When I saw on tv,

17
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,200
that Constance Griffiths got you out,

18
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,800
I said "That girl's gonna be my lawyer."

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,100
Is that right ?

20
00:00:33,965 --> 00:00:36,214
<i>"The Fallen Woman"</i>

21
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,700
- Hello ?
- Charlie ?

22
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,800
What's wrong ?

23
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,500
I didn't know who else to call.

24
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,900
Constance, what happened ?

25
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,300
I'm so scared.

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,900
What happened?

27
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Hey.

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
It's Cudy.

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,800
He didn't...

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,600
No, no.
Not like that.

31
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,800
He just... wanted money.

32
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,000
Like you got.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,900
He thought that I can get that for him,

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,900
and when I said that
I couldn't do that,

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,000
then he hit me,
and I...

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,700
I'm so stupid.

37
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,300
And I wanted him to be you.

38
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,900
'Cause you're not mine anymore.

39
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,300
All those years,

40
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,700
you were mine.

41
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,200
I know.

42
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,800
Hold me.

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Please just hold.

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,600
It's gonna be okay.

47
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,400
It's a dead angel.

48
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,900
It's a dead woman
with a pair of fake wings.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,400
- How do you know ?
- Well, I know the wings are fake,

50
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,000
because I can see
the harness right there.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,800
Maybe she's a real angel
with fake wings.

52
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,500
Why would a real angel...

53
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,400
No. No.

54
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,700
I'm not doing this with you.

55
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,800
A witness says she just fell out
of the sky.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Wham!

57
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,300
Angel wings?

58
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,000
The med's gonna have a filled day.

59
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,900
No i.d. Just the black dress and the wings.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,300
She must have hit
that car pretty hard.

61
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,400
Do you think she came from...

62
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,500
That window.

63
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,900
I think she came
from that window.

64
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
- Hey Bobby.
- Yeah.

65
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,300
I was wondering if I could
ask you a favor.

66
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,000
Sure, Charlie. Just tell me.

67
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,100
I don't remember her checking in.

68
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,100
Well, she probably wasn't
wearing wings at the time.

69
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,600
No clothes in the closet,

70
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,700
no suitcase. There's nothing in the
bathroom. No personal effects at all.

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,700
The computer says the room is vacant.

72
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,600
<i>A woman, wearing angel wings,</i>

73
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,200
<i>was pushed out of a 9th
storey window and smashed...</i>

74
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,900
Oh, this was already on hand.

75
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,100
<i>unfortunately her wings
could not save her.</i>

76
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,800
<i>If you're here to i.d.
the angel,</i>

77
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,000
<i>please stay in line.</i>

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,400
She wasn't an angel.

79
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
What were it then ?

80
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,000
They only look like angels,

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,200
but they're not.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,400
They're aliens.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,900
- It's the end...
- Of the world.

84
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,000
- When angels die...
- It's the end.

85
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,800
Our singer, Angel,
left us after a gig in the HB*.

86
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,700
I think it's her.

87
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,100
You wanna touch them ?

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,300
You'll feel like real is.

89
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,900
No, it's not her. I guess we went back
to bring her after all.

90
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,700
You wanna know a secret about angels?

91
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,500
Absolutely.

92
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,700
We're not always so good.

93
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm not in a hurry.
Go ahead.

94
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,100
Can we see the picture ?

95
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,900
Just to be sure.

96
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,300
No.

97
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,100
No, that's... Not our Kylie.

98
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,500
Detective, may I
ask when you lost your faith?

99
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,500
I'd rather not talk
about my faith.

100
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,800
You don't have it anymore, do you Dear ?
But you used to, didn't you ?

101
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,800
You know, we have
a lot of people to get to so...

102
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,200
- If you don't mind...
- But you want it back, don't you ?

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,200
It's there, waiting for you,
if you want it.

104
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,700
Whenever you want it.

105
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,500
You know that,
don't you, Dear ?

106
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,700
I'm takin' a break.

107
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,900
I'm in no hurry. Go ahead.

108
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,900
It's a real freak show.

109
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,700
I did that thing you asked.

110
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,800
Went by that guy car,
his work and apartment.

111
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,900
Hasn't been seen
at either of them since yesterday.

112
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,800
I ran a list of his
known associates.

113
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,000
Want me to run out
some of them?

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,700
- No, I got it.
- Are you sure ?

115
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,300
Hey, whatever it is, man,
i'm okay with it.

116
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,400
Crews.

117
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,600
We've got another one.

118
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
We gotta go.

119
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,200
What was the deal with Stark?

120
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,900
He wants us to start a bowling league.

121
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,500
Just because the wings were fake,

122
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,100
doesn't mean she wasn't a real angel.

123
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,500
Isn't there an "off" button?

124
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,400
I know she wasn't an angel
on a cloud with a harp angel, but...

125
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Maybe she was an angel in
the way we all might be angels.

126
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,600
We all might be angels ?

127
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,300
Crews, l'm gonna
tell you something.

128
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,100
You know, there're may be
a few things...

129
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,800
that I don't know about myself,
but...

130
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,100
I'm sure I'm not an angel.

131
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,300
You see, that's exactly the kind of
humble things an angel might say.

132
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,100
That was very hostile.

133
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,500
That was at close
to hostile.

134
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,200
The detectives are here.

135
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,800
Whose genius idea was this ?

136
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,300
What do you say, Reese ?

137
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,800
Write them up
and send them home ?

138
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,000
We all did things like these
when we were young.

139
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,300
You know, pranks.

140
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,000
I tried. Good luck.

141
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,600
You know what I was doin' before I
got the call to investigate this ?

142
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,000
I was investing a homicide.

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,200
What you have done is waist my time.

144
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,800
Throwing that off from the roof
was a crime,

145
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,800
but wasting my time is what
you both are gonna pay for. Take them in.

146
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,800
All right. Let's go.

147
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,500
That was hostile.

148
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,700
Maybe she isn't an angel,
after all.

149
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,500
<i>It was a big responsability,</i>

150
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,700
<i>saving someone's life ?</i>

151
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,100
It was a surprising amount of paperwork.

152
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,900
Several thousand pages.

153
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,500
<i>Does he feel in debt to you ?</i>

154
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,700
Charlie ?

155
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,000
Detective Crews,
he doesn't owe me anything.

156
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,900
<i>He owes you his life, yes?</i>

157
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,200
I was just doing my job.

158
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,400
<i>So Detective Crews
was just one more client.</i>

159
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,000
Hum.. N..no.

160
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,900
Of course not.

161
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,300
I would never say that.

162
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,200
Ah... No. I don't think I can break that.

163
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,800
No, I don't want change, Ron.
I want you to have it.

164
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,900
How do you know my name?

165
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,200
Oh, I know a lot about you.

166
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,300
I know you spent three years
up in Lompoc.

167
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,700
What, you're a cop?

168
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,900
No just now, I'm not.

169
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,900
So what do you want ?

170
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,700
I'm looking for your pal, Cudahy.

171
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,500
And don't tell me you don't know.

172
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,300
Let's not do that, okay, Ron ?

173
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,700
You celled with him for fourteen
months up at Lompoc,

174
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,700
and then after you had
a little business together.

175
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,600
Something about girls, right ?

176
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,900
I don't know where he is.

177
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,200
You broke my finger.

178
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,900
There's just kiddin'. Let's not exaggerate.

179
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,100
What do you think about thought?

180
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,800
I... I don't understand you.

181
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Thought, Ron.

182
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,600
Often gets in the way of truth.

183
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,900
Pain, Ron,
clears the mind of thought.

184
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,900
Let all toughts,

185
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,200
flee your mind,

186
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,200
and let the truth
make itself know.

187
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,000
Look, i don't know
where cudahy is.

188
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,600
I can make some calls.

189
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,700
Let... let me make
some calls.

190
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,700
Is that the truth ?

191
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,400
Yeah.

192
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,500
There.
Good as new.

193
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,400
Better than new.

194
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,200
Because now, you have had
this experience.

195
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,500
Look, if i - if i find Cudahy,

196
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,900
Who--who should i say
is looking for him?

197
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,100
He'll know.

198
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,300
No i.d. on her or left in the room.

199
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,500
it's like she fell
out of the sky.

200
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,700
She fell out of a window.

201
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,100
It's like she's no one

202
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,300
No one is no one.

203
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,100
Now you sound like me.

204
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Take that back.

205
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,600
Would it be so bad?

206
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,800
<i>I'm in no hurry.</i>

207
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,700
go ahead.

208
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,600
Reese, Reese.

209
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,800
<i>Hey.</i>

210
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,400
i know it's all about
the journey,

211
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,000
<i>but, er... sooner or later</i>

212
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,200
you're just gonna have to get
to the front of the line.

213
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,000
I know.
I--I know.

214
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,200
Detective Crews.

215
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,500
Detective Reese.

216
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Your name is...?

217
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,700
Jasper.

218
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,800
Jasper Willens.

219
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,500
How come you've been
giving your space away, Jasper Willens?

220
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,700
'cause i'm afraid.

221
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,600
Afraid of what?

222
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,800
Afraid of the answer?

223
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,900
That's right.

224
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,300
There's an answer
at the front of the line.

225
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,400
if you never get there,
you don't ever have to know?

226
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,000
That's right.

227
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,000
You think it's gonna be bad news,

228
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,500
if you find out the truth ?

229
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,000
Truth usually is.

230
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,300
I'm that guy.

231
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,300
- Which guy is that ?
- The guy that gets the bad news.

232
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,900
But you came down here,
Jasper.

233
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,000
so you did want to know,
didn't you?

234
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,200
And now do you know
where you are ?

235
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,600
you're at the front
of the line.

236
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,200
I saw the...

237
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,300
photo on the news

238
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,500
of that woman
on the car.

239
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,300
and i think i know her.

240
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,000
How do you know her ?

241
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,900
She's Lena.

242
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,800
my wife.

243
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,600
I came home from work
last night,

244
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,000
and Lena always
has dinner ready.

245
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,800
She wasn't home.

246
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,800
And she never came home.

247
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,100
And then i saw the news.

248
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,800
She always had
dinner ready?

249
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,900
Every night.

250
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,100
She liked to cook.

251
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,600
May i ask what kind of work
you do?

252
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,200
I make glue.

253
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,900
I--i own a company that makes
industrial glues and adhesives.

254
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,100
We moved over $14 million
dollars worth of product last year.

255
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,000
That's a lot of glue.

256
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,900
Well, it's what
holds us together.

257
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,400
Oh.

258
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,900
That's our slogan.

259
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,600
"It's what
holds us together."

260
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,300
Do you know why your wife
was at the hotel ?

261
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,300
I have to ask, uh...

262
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,700
She was wearing wings.

263
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Do you know why?

264
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,100
I never saw those.

265
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,000
I don't know why
she would have them on.

266
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,500
Do you know anyone who'd want to hurt
your wife, jasper?

267
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,100
He would.

268
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,700
He ?

269
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,400
He told her he'd take her
away from me if i didn't pay.

270
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,900
But i paid every month,
and he took her anyway.

271
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,900
Who said that ?

272
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,800
Tell us his name, jasper.

273
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,600
Then tell us
about your wife.

274
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,900
I--i met lena
about two years ago

275
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,400
at this bar
that i'd heard about, Ritual.

276
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,900
Where did you hear
about that bar?

277
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,100
It's where an older man
can find...

278
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,000
- What he needed?
- She was from russia,

279
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,500
and she'd had
a hard time there,

280
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
and she liked that
i could make her laugh.

281
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,200
And you had to pay
every month?

282
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,600
Not at first,
not for the first year.

283
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,400
And then we got married,
and... and...

284
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,800
I have to go now.

285
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
I--i just came to see
if it was Lena.

286
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,300
To see if it was her,
and i--

287
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,900
i need to go home now.

288
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,500
What happened
when you got married?

289
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,100
Is that door locked ?

290
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,500
You are in a police station.

291
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,400
Is that door locked ?

292
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,900
What happened
when you were married?

293
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,900
We came home that night,
from that party and...

294
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,500
he was in our house.

295
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Who was ?

296
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,100
Why was he in your house ?

297
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,300
He was sitting
in my kitchen.

298
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,600
Lena must have
given him the key

299
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,400
r the alarm code.

300
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,000
He said that i owed him

301
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,100
for the time that we'd already
spent together,

302
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,300
and that if i wanted her
to stay with me,

303
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,100
i had...i had to pay him
every month,

304
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,800
or he would take her away
and he would punish her.

305
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,400
He beat her like a dog.

306
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,400
He'd make Lena
live in a cage

307
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,700
like a dog.

308
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,500
Tell us his name.

309
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,400
I paid !

310
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,600
I paid $10,000 every month !

311
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,300
Why did he take her from me
if i paid ?

312
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,300
Why ?

313
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,300
Give us the name, jasper,
of the man who killed lena.

314
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
Roman...

315
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,100
No last name, just Roman.

316
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,100
That's it.

317
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,800
We're running it,
but Roman is like...

318
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,100
John in russian.

319
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,700
So the russian girl
is a natasha.

320
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,100
a Lena.

321
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,600
No, her name is Lena,
but she's a natasha.

322
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,700
It's what they call the scam
the russians run on american men.

323
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,500
Get them hooked on a pretty
russian girl,

324
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,300
get them married,
then come for the payment.

325
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,200
It's a long-term con.
Takes patience.

326
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,300
Sounds like you
admire them.

327
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,100
I respect
how good they are.

328
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,100
And you'll respect them too,
or...

329
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,200
Or...?

330
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,200
Or they will feed you
to their dog.

331
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,400
Industrial glue.

332
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,500
It's what holds us together.

333
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,800
A natasha.

334
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,400
That's one word for it.

335
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,300
She was a prostitute,
Crews, not an angel.

336
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
You can't be both?

337
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,700
Well, i'm pretty sure
that there's a rule

338
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,700
that says you can't be
a prostie and an angel.

339
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,700
I know a prostitute at pelican
bay whose name was Angel.

340
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,700
They have women at pelican bay?

341
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,900
No, she wasn't a woman woman.

342
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,700
And just to make it clear,
i didn't "know" her...him.

343
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,500
didn't know her-him.

344
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,200
But she did make
a nice carrot cake.

345
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,500
Maybe i should go in first.

346
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,900
It's some kind of
upscale pick up joint,

347
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,800
and, you know,
i'll go in and i'll...

348
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,100
And you'll...?

349
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,100
I'll get...
picked up.

350
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,500
I'll be ten minutes.

351
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,800
So i'm not too old,
i hope.

352
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,400
Ah, no.
Not too old.

353
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,100
Anyways, i don't like
all these young men in L.A.

354
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,000
I think i scare them.

355
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,700
Oh, yeah ?
Why is that ?

356
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,600
Because they're
so easy to read.

357
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,700
I can see how silly
they are.

358
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,400
They all want one thing,
you know ?

359
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,900
Can you read me ?

360
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,400
Do you want me to ?

361
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,700
I can tell...
you have money.

362
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,500
The watch told you that.

363
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,200
I can tell
it is new money.

364
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,700
Now, how did you know that ?

365
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,700
And i can tell that you do not know
what to do with your new money.

366
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,400
Do you know what else
i can tell ?

367
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,600
What ?

368
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,700
I can tell you're a cop.

369
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,200
I can tell she's one too.

370
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,600
Her name was Lena.

371
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,300
She was thrown
from a window.

372
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,500
I had seen her around,
but not for a long time.

373
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,700
Do you know
what a natasha is ?

374
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,300
You let her talk for you?

375
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,900
Do you know a man
named Roman ?

376
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,600
I know a lot of men
named Roman.

377
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,200
It is common name in russia.

378
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,300
Officer new money,

379
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,300
How come you let the woman
do your business ?

380
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,900
I can read people too.

381
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,800
and i think it made you sad

382
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,100
when Lena died.

383
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,300
I also think you know the Roman
my partner asked you about.

384
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,200
Know Roman ?

385
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,900
No one knows Roman.

386
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,500
All right, really...

387
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,700
What is it with this guy ?

388
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,900
What is with Roman ?

389
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,400
He's not what you american cops
are used to.

390
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,400
He was born
in russian prison.

391
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,000
He's been to hell and back.

392
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Roman is not
like the rest of us.

393
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,100
Why is that ?

394
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,100
Roman has no fear.

395
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,700
Well, i'd like to ask him
about that.

396
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,800
Maybe you can tell us
where to find him.

397
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,800
Don't worry. If you're looking
for Roman, he will find you.

398
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,900
But you can't hold on to him.

399
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,000
When you reach out for Roman,
he's not there.

400
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,300
I saw the news.

401
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,100
So she wasn't an angel
after all.

402
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,800
She was just a...
a what ?

403
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,200
Just a lost girl.

404
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,800
Hey,

405
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,700
you didn't file a report
about Cudahy about what happened.

406
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,200
Oh, i'm done with it.

407
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,100
You're done with it.

408
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,400
Right, Charlie?
you're done with it.

409
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,800
Do you want to talk
about these boxes?

410
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,100
- Do you like them?
- Do you want to talk about

411
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,400
why you're packing books

412
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,500
Because it's what people do
when they're moving.

413
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,300
Pack books into boxes.

414
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm going to need them
with me in New York.

415
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,200
I'm going to New York.

416
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,100
When ?

417
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,300
Tomorrow.

418
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,000
- For how long ?
- A while.

419
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,700
My firm has
a big case there,

420
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,600
and i'm going
to sit in on it.

421
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,300
New York.

422
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,700
City that never sleeps.

423
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,300
No, i've been there.
it sleeps a little. naps.

424
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,000
I need to go, Charlie.

425
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,800
I need to go away.

426
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
My husband...

427
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,900
I'm here with him,
but i'm away from him.

428
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,000
And you...

429
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,800
I'm here with you,
but i'm--

430
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,300
I'm not here with you.

431
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
I need to go.

432
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,700
Want some help
with those boxes?

433
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,900
No, my husband's on his way,
and he's going to help me...

434
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,500
...pack.

435
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,000
So i guess
i should take off then.

436
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,300
Yeah.

437
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,600
Okay.

438
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,100
Roman is Roman Nevikov.

439
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,600
We ran financials on ritual.

440
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
He doesn't own it.

441
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,800
A company that he owns,
owns a company that owns it.

442
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,300
LAPD has had this guy
on their radar for years.

443
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,300
Stolen dvds, identity theft,
gasoline scams.

444
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,400
Oh, keep reading.

445
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,700
He also loves the blood sport.

446
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,200
He's heavy into dog fighting,

447
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,500
anything that dies.

448
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,300
He said he'd make Lena his dog.

449
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,600
He said he'd make Lena
live in a cage like a dog.

450
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,500
That's what Jasper said Roman
would do to Lena if he stopped paying.

451
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,700
I mean, we've been after this
animal roman for years,

452
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,400
and i don't see one indictment
in his jacket.

453
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,500
Not one charge in here
that sticks.

454
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,500
"Uou can't hold on to him.

455
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,200
You reach out for Roman,
but he's not there."

456
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,000
That's what Julia said.

457
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Well, i want you two
to reach out

458
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,700
and bring backup to make sure
you hold on to him.

459
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,100
Lena may not have been
an angel,

460
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,700
but she was a woman
living in my city.

461
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,700
If Roman killed her,
i want him for it.

462
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Is he in there ?

463
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,500
Well, detective, we're not
actually sure about that.

464
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,700
Either Roman is in there
or Roman is not in there.

465
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,000
21-david saw him
enter the building,

466
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,100
23 and 25-david were um...

467
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,200
not able to verify.

468
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,400
An escalade has pulled up
to the building.

469
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,000
All units,
hold your position.

470
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,600
Is that clear?
hold your position.

471
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,700
<i>Doors opening, no clear
sight of the subject.</i>

472
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,600
<i>This is 23-david,
we have eyes on the subject</i>

473
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,500
<i>entering the club.</i>

474
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,400
<i>Negative that.
this is 25-david.</i>

475
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,900
<i>Subject has left the club.
Subject is in the suv.</i>

476
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,000
<i>23-david, do we have a go
to enter the club?</i>

477
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
<i>We need instructions.</i>

478
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,200
<i>Do we enter the club
or follow the vehicle?</i>

479
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,700
A little freaky,
right?

480
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,800
A little bit.

481
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,100
Okay.

482
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,000
Officer new money...

483
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,000
Cuff me.

484
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,400
Report came back from interpol.

485
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,500
Our new friend, Roman,is a person of
interest in five murders back in russia.

486
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,600
After he fled the country,
they found two hockey players,

487
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,100
cut up and buried in his basement.

488
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,600
Man, this guy is a sociopath.

489
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,100
So what's he doing
in this country?

490
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,000
How does Roman get into the U.S. ?

491
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,800
What are you thinking?

492
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,500
We started out looking for an angel.

493
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,400
And now we're staring at the devil.

494
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,500
How you doing?

495
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,600
Splendid.

496
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,100
I like this room.

497
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,300
- You do ?
- 12 years in prison,

498
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,100
and you're still walking upright.

499
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,100
Just between us...

500
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,500
You killed that family,
didn't you?

501
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,200
That belong to you?

502
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,600
Do you mean did I own her ?

503
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,800
We have a witness who pins you
to human trafficking.

504
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,500
You know what kind of time
that carries?

505
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,500
He won't testify.

506
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,000
- Why not?
- How's that rehab working for you?

507
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,300
Down time's the hardest.

508
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,200
You have nothing to do,

509
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,200
your muscles get all twitchy.

510
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,700
You can taste it
in the back of your throat.

511
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,500
Shut up.

512
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,900
All the way down there

513
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,400
In the back of your throat.

514
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,900
Shut your mouth.

515
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,000
You got hooked
working undercover.

516
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,200
Shut your mouth.

517
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,600
Took a junkie lover too.

518
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,300
What ever happened to him?

519
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,800
You look at me
when you talk.

520
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,100
You know what a Natasha is, Roman?

521
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,100
You think this girl
was a Natasha,

522
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,000
and I killed her.

523
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,400
Let me ask you a question.

524
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,000
If she was my Natasha,
earning my money,

525
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,600
why would I kill her?

526
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,500
I'm a businessman...
it's just bad business.

527
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,700
You have a good look.

528
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,300
If you ever want to make
some real money,

529
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,700
you should call me, okay,

530
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,500
Detective Dani Reese?

531
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,500
Now, in about two minutes,

532
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,100
my overpriced lawyer's going
to come in and tell you

533
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,700
that there's nothing to tie me
to this poor dead girl.

534
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,100
Then my lawyer is going to tell you

535
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,700
that he and i are leaving.

536
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,900
It was a pleasure meeting you.

537
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,200
And you, Detective.

538
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,000
What if it was one of them
who set you up?

539
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,300
Crews.

540
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,900
So where are we?

541
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,000
We're uh...we're back
at the beginning.

542
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,000
Okay.

543
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,800
So let's go back
to the beginning.

544
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,600
The hotel room
where she was thrown.

545
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,000
When Roman
said those things,

546
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,200
did you want to shoot him?

547
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,700
Yes.

548
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,500
Me too.

549
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,000
Did you see yourself
shooting him?

550
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,700
Yes.

551
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,100
Me too.

552
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,400
You lost your faith
because of the guy,

553
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,500
not the drugs.

554
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,500
My faith has been gone
for so long,

555
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,700
I can't remember
when it was that I lost it.

556
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,800
Or if I ever even had it.

557
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,400
So they were here,
but no one was registered.

558
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
So how do you get into a room
without registering?

559
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,500
You steal a key.

560
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Or you buy one.

561
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,200
Stan, are your
employers here aware,

562
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,500
that you were fired from your
last three jobs for stealing?

563
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,600
Nothing's missing.
I didn't steal nothing.

564
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,900
No, you can't steal nothing.

565
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,000
Nothing does not exist.

566
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,800
To steal something
that doesn't exist...

567
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,700
Wait.

568
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,000
If it doesn't exist...

569
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,400
Then how can
it be something?

570
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,900
Ha!
I hate that.

571
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,000
Don't you hate that?

572
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,200
It's a brain fart, right?

573
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,300
Crews!

574
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,000
Nothing's been stolen, Stan.

575
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,500
But you do have a pass key,
don't you?

576
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,900
So you want us
to question you about this,

577
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,400
or about the murder
that happened here?

578
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,500
My buddy Oliver,
he does my ink.

579
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,700
I pay him with pass keys.

580
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,400
Look, no one
was staying here.

581
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,800
How is that stealing?

582
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,000
So what exactly is it
you do here?

583
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,100
Mostly tattoos
and airbrush stuff on cars and bikes.

584
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,100
We work in metal
and flesh.

585
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,500
What does Oliver
do here?

586
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,800
Oh, just the designs.

587
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,500
He designed...
He designed this.

588
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,700
It's good, right?

589
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,600
I have the same design
on my Ducati.

590
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,600
Metal and flesh.

591
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,000
That's right.

592
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,300
You want a tattoo?

593
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
Oh, I have some.

594
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,300
Come on.

595
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,400
When does someone
like you get tattoos?

596
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
It's complicated.

597
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,800
That's Oliver's
work station.

598
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,600
When was he last here?

599
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,300
I don't know, maybe a few days.

600
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,400
People kind of
come and go here.

601
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,500
You got a great view of Roman's
night club from here.

602
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,700
You wouldn't happen
to have

603
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,500
oliver's home address,
would you?

604
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,300
Do you really have
any tattoos?

605
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
You wanna see 'em?

606
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,200
Absolutely not.

607
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,400
Oliver Sanderson!

608
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,900
We have a warrant
to search these premises.

609
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,800
I have a pass key.

610
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,700
That's her, right?

611
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,500
That's Lena.

612
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
Art school graduate.

613
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,000
And lover of angels.

614
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,100
We find his car around the block
from the hotel,

615
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,500
where Lena died.

616
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,100
No calls on his cell phone,

617
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,100
or land line
since her murder.

618
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,700
Mail stacked up
outside his door.

619
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,200
No charges
on his credit card.

620
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
No charges
on his starbucks* card.

621
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,200
This kid is nowhere.

622
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,700
No one is nowhere.

623
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,700
Now you're sounding
like me again.

624
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,500
Am I ?

625
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Okay.

626
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,500
Okay, that picture
with Lena in the wings.

627
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,400
She posed for that photo.

628
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,800
She put those wings on
and posed.

629
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,600
So that Oliver
could take that picture.

630
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,000
So you think maybe Lena...

631
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,400
put those wings on
for Oliver?

632
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,400
Now, who would Lena
talk to about that?

633
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,600
Where is Officer
New Money?

634
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,300
Detective New Money,
actually.

635
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,500
These russians are tough.

636
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,200
Sounds like you
admire them.

637
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,900
Julia...

638
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,800
Lena posed for that photo,
didn't she?

639
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:10,700
Yes.

640
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,200
Who'd she put
the wings on for?

641
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,100
For Oliver.

642
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,200
He said she was his angel.

643
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,800
Lena and Oliver were in love.

644
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,300
She was married
to that Jasper.

645
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,000
She was working for him...

646
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,100
Roman, but she was in love
with that punk kid Oliver.

647
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,200
She wore expensive dresses,

648
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,000
and she knew how to order wine,

649
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,700
but she was only
23 years old and...

650
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,600
and she wanted
to be young.

651
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,500
Yes.

652
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,000
How old are you, Julia?

653
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,400
22, but...

654
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,200
None of us are young.

655
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,500
Julia,

656
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,900
Did Roman know,

657
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,200
about Lena and Oliver?

658
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,200
I don't know.

659
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,500
But Lena was leaving.

660
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,600
Lena and Oliver were leaving.

661
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,400
She was leaving Jasper.

662
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,300
She was leaving Roman.

663
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,100
What would Roman do
to Lena if he found out?

664
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,300
He would kill her.

665
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,400
Even though she makes him
money?

666
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,600
He'd kill her
to set an example.

667
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,900
That's right.

668
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,500
To set an example.

669
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,900
And what about Oliver?

670
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,900
I die, you know,

671
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,600
as I say these things to you.

672
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,300
These words kill me.

673
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,400
We can protect you.

674
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,600
What would he do
to sweet Oliver,

675
00:33:43,674 --> 00:33:45,185
for trying to steal Lena,

676
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,300
trying to steal his property?

677
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,100
Death would be too good for him.

678
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,200
You understand, don't you?

679
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,300
<i>Is that door locked?</i>

680
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,500
<i>You're at a police station.</i>

681
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,700
<i>Is that door locked?</i>

682
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,300
That's a lot of fear,
Jasper.

683
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,900
To be so afraid of someone in
the middle of a police station.

684
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,300
That kind of fear
doesn't come from a threat.

685
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,900
It comes from a beating.

686
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,700
When you talked
about the dogs, Jasper,

687
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,300
about what Roman would do,

688
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,200
did he do it to you?

689
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,200
Did he show you the cage?

690
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,000
Roman's going to kill
someone else, Jasper.

691
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,200
Someone Lena...

692
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,000
someone Lena loved.

693
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,100
Where are the cages?

694
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,200
He blindfolded me.

695
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,500
I can't tell you
where they are.

696
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,600
Do you remember anything?

697
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,100
Anything that might be useful?

698
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,500
It smelled
like gasoline.

699
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,200
Even with all those dogs,

700
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,600
it smelled like gasoline.

701
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,100
What about that gas scam
that Roman was never tied to?

702
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,600
Where did they
operate out of?

703
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,600
Gasoline.
No one fires.

704
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,100
<i>Over here!</i>

705
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,200
She was my angel.

706
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,300
Did Roman kill Lena?

707
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,800
He threw her out that window.

708
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,600
We met there.

709
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,500
We thought we were safe,

710
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,500
we thought nobody
could find us.

711
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,700
He found you.

712
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,500
She'd put the wings on
for me.

713
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,600
I'd draw her....

714
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,800
For me.

715
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,900
Roman found you.

716
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,100
Yes, she...

717
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,000
She told him
we were gonna leave.

718
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,300
He laughed at us,

719
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,000
he laughed at her wings.

720
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,700
She...

721
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,600
spit at him and...

722
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,400
And then?

723
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,000
Then he threw her
out the window!

724
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,100
Took me here,

725
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,500
to be his dog.

726
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,200
Will you testify to that
in court?

727
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,200
You will testify
that Roman killed Lena?

728
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,300
He made me his dog.

729
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,700
Ready?

730
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,400
Ready, ready.

731
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,800
Detectives Reese and Crews,

732
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,400
This is special agent Bodner.

733
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,100
Homeland security.

734
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,100
Oh, I don't think I'm gonna like
what happens next.

735
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,300
Well, i'd just say
lay back and get it over with.

736
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,900
But we took this seminar,
so now i don't talk like that.

737
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,000
- You took Roman.
- Detective, we've had Roman.

738
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,400
He's ours.
He's always been ours.

739
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
He killed a woman.

740
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,000
We have a witness
that'll testify to that.

741
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,100
I'm sure you do.

742
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,000
But you can't have a trial,
because you can't have Roman.

743
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,900
- Like I said, he's ours.
- He threw a woman out the window.

744
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,200
Roman Nevikov provides
information

745
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,400
about drug and arms shipments
between Russia, Mexico, and the U.S.

746
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,900
That untell can save
hundreds of lives.

747
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,600
Save hundreds of lives, you expect I'm
gonna believe you actually care about...

748
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,400
That's enough.

749
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,200
Detective, you have no idea
how the real world works,

750
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,700
- Do you ?
- No, but I know how guys...

751
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,900
like you work, and it's all
about the power, isn't it?

752
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,700
You... You close your mouth now.

753
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,700
And you.

754
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,900
Take your russian and get
the hell out of my house.

755
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,400
"You can't hold on to him.

756
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,100
You reach out for Roman,
but he isn't there."

757
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,000
Hello, Neil.

758
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,500
Oh...

759
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,400
I'm trying to forgive you,
Cudahy.

760
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,100
But what you did
to Constance...

761
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,600
I just wanted
what you got.

762
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,700
They paid you that money
just to shut up.

763
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,200
Why shouldn't they
pay me too?

764
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,100
I know I'd be a better person
if I did forgive you.

765
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,200
I just wanted
what you got.

766
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,700
I've called the police.

767
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,500
I am the police.

768
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,600
- Hey.
- Hey.

769
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,800
Hey, did you ever find
that guy you were looking for?

770
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,900
No.
No, I never did.

771
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:25,800
Hello?

772
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,900
<i>Detective...</i>

773
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,900
<i>I have something you might be
interested in.</i>

774
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,600
Oh, yeah?
What would that be?

775
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,500
The bank of Los Angeles
shoot-out.

776
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,200
How 'bout it?

777
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,900
You should ask your partner
about the bank of L.A. shoot-out.

778
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,100
That was 15 years ago.

779
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,100
<i>I know.</i>

780
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,400
You should ask your partner.

781
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,300
<i>you should ask your partner</i>

782
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,600
<i>what happened
to all that money.</i>

783
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,700
<i>Good bye, Detective.</i>
