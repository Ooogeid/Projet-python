1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,190
Previously on life.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,790
Detective, I have something
you might be interested in.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,420
The bank of los angeles shootout.

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,720
That was 15 years ago.

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,210
You should ask your partner
what happened to all that money.

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,270
- Bobby said...
- I don't know what your old partner told you,

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,870
But he was working the
barricades four blocks out.

8
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:17,900
Hi.

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,540
Hello. I'm olivia.

10
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:24,390
The thing about olivia is she's marrying your father.

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,390
<Font color="#ffff00">life season01
episode07 a civil war</font>

12
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,600
I wanna tell you about
the dream i had last night.

13
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,410
Were there clowns in it?

14
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,150
No.

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,100
I don't like dreams with clowns.

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:40,880
Who does?

17
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,030
No, there were no clowns in this dream.

18
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,200
There were solar panels.

19
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,200
An array of solar panels.

20
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,270
Solar panels?

21
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,610
I wanna buy a solar farm.

22
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,910
You already have an orange grove.

23
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,320
And now i want a solar farm.

24
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:56,010
Energy, ted, made out of light.

25
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,980
Solar farms don't exactly
turn in a huge profit, charlie.

26
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:06,040
The profit will be in our small contribution
to restoring the natural harmony of our planet.

27
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:11,760
I don't think there's a column in the spreadsheet
under restoration of planetary harmony.

28
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,570
I want that solar farm, ted.

29
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,050
It came to me in a dream.

30
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,790
In the back by the sodey pop.

31
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,700
You're not gonna like it though.

32
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,410
No id's.

33
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,180
They look like persian kids though.

34
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,950
Wrote it in oil.

35
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,820
Hate crime? Skinheads?

36
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,450
Cash in the register went untouched.

37
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,780
Nothing stolen. Just those two there.

38
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,870
Two dead iranian-Americans in here.

39
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,130
Bunch of angry people out there.

40
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,670
Get some more units down here.

41
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,900
There were three of 'em.

42
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,720
Early 20s maybe,you know.
They were wearing ski masks.

43
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,370
And they each had a gun.

44
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,530
What happened then?

45
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,850
They were over by the
cooler makin' a lot of noise.

46
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,130
One of 'em was saying,"go
back to where you came from."

47
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,100
The other one kept saying,"this
is where i came from."

48
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,560
Then I heard two shots,and
then it was quiet.

49
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,070
Firecrackers. M80s.

50
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,370
No gun. Just firecrackers.No gun.

51
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,170
That's all this crowd
needs. You got this?

52
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,560
Yeah.

53
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,380
You threw those!

54
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,430
More units?

55
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,110
More units.

56
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,110
You're not listening to us.

57
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,520
No,you're not listening to me.

58
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll ask you one more time
to step out of the store.

59
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,970
It's okay. I got this,officer.

60
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,100
All yours,detective.

61
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,740
Why is she so upset?

62
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,070
Amir,my brother,he was stopping
here on the way home from class.

63
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,530
And he never came home?

64
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,960
Is he your brother Amir?

65
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,720
No. But those are his
friends, Rashne and Daria.

66
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,810
What's she saying?

67
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,910
Amir came to this store with Rashne and but
if he's not here, he must have been taken.

68
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,530
- They must have taken him.
- Who?

69
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,960
Whoever did this to Rashne and Daria.

70
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,630
"Go home."

71
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,870
I bet those kids thought they were home.

74
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,740
Hey,nice job out there,Bobby.

75
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,460
That knucklehead with the tire iron?

76
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,720
Yeah,it's nothin'.

77
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,400
Hey,it was only nothing 'cause
you did something to him.

78
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,920
If you hadn't done anything,it might
have become any number of things.

79
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,840
Do you have to wind him up?

80
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,590
Any number of things.

81
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,760
That guy with the tire iron hits the
other guy,and the whole place goes up.

82
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:39,460
A butterfly flaps its wings,and halfway
across the world,a hurricane forms.

83
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,710
See? No matter where it starts,always
ends up with something just like that.

84
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,250
Something,nothing,anything.

85
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,590
A butterfly,a hurricane.

86
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,730
It'll make a good story.

87
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,140
It's no Bank of Los Angeles,but
at least it's true,right?

88
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,970
What'd you say?

89
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,490
Nothing.

90
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,450
No. You said something.

91
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,550
See? Something? Nothing?

92
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,280
Can't get away from it.

93
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,900
You mention the butterfly,i'm
gonna find it and rip its wings off.

94
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,780
What did you say about
the Bank of Los Angeles?

95
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,200
It's just a story I
like to tell,detective.

96
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,370
Why? What's it to you?

97
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,350
What kinda story?

98
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,050
You're stepping over a line
here. You might wanna step back.

99
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,940
Full house.

100
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,920
Yeah,I count FBI ,homeland
security, mayor's office.

101
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,160
Joint terrorism task
force,hate crimes unit.

102
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,700
This is still a
homicide,first and foremost.

103
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:45,520
And unless the federal government is
requesting the LAPD relinquish its jurisdiction,

104
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:50,670
it will be handled as an a homicide
and run by LAPD homicide detectives.

105
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,350
Rashne Talebi and Daria Ovesi.

106
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,200
Each shot once in the
head at close range.

107
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,250
Both are third year
at USC* Business School.

108
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,340
Both honor students.

109
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,330
Both had juvie beefs for dealing pot.

110
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,560
Records were expunged.

111
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:13,240
Three white males wearing ski masks
left the white counter guy alone.

112
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,050
Put the dead victims in the cooler.

113
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,750
Wrote "go home" in motor
oil on the cooler door.

114
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,380
Amir Darvashi, classmate of the victims.

115
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,690
He was reported to be at the gas
station at time of the shooting.

116
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,190
Hasn't been seen since.

117
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,020
Witnesses on scene said they saw a van leaving the
parking lot at high speed just after the shooting.

118
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,760
Color of this van could be
blue,light gray,or beige.

119
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,240
Pull over every vehicle
that even looks close.

120
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,960
This neighborhood was
predominately white,

121
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,580
but has had a heavy persian
influx since the '80s.

122
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,180
Now it's about evenly split.

123
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,240
This needs to close and close fast.

124
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,400
I do not need the war here.

125
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,280
I've arranged to meet the owner of
the gas station... Mary Ann Farmer.

126
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,670
And you?

127
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,480
Mother of the missing boy Amir.

128
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,050
I'll see what I can find out
about him and his friends.

129
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,180
Charlie?

130
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,480
I have one word for
you... Photodiode.

131
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,770
I don't know what that means.

132
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,590
It means transducer's light energy.

133
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,490
Energy from light, Charlie.

134
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,320
From the sun.

135
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,760
We can do this?

136
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,520
I know what I said at
breakfast this morning.

137
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:24,410
But I've been thinking about
what you said,about your dream.

138
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,180
You're right,Charlie. We are choking.

139
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,310
Choking on fossil fuel.

140
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,770
You found an array ?

141
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,540
I'm on my way right now to see it.

142
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,290
Oh, uh, Ted, Olivia.

143
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,630
Olivia?

144
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,900
I told her to come by the house.

145
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,850
You know,so we
could-- We could talk.

146
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,490
You didn't tell me that.

147
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,450
No. There's things I don't tell you,Ted.

148
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,350
But... Olivia...

149
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,850
She's coming by the house.

150
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:51,770
Just explain to her something came
up and I can't get away,okay? Thanks.

151
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,760
I was gonna see the solar farm.

152
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,770
Maybe she'd like to go with me.

153
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,510
Yeah,right.

154
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,210
Because women really
like photovoltaic arrays.

155
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,420
Detective Crews?

156
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,760
Ms.Farmer?

157
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,180
Mary Ann.

158
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,460
You look surprised.

159
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,360
No,no. No,I,um...

160
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,930
No,I guess I
just expected,um--

161
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,350
Someone older.

162
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,260
Maybe.

163
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,250
Careful of having
expectations,Detective.

164
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,340
They only lead to disappointment.

165
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,550
Where'd you hear that?

166
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,480
That one I didn't hear.
That one I had to learn.

167
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,600
Is it okay to go inside?

168
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,190
I'm not gonna disturb the evidence?

169
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,880
No,it's okay.

170
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,120
This is my first store.

171
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,710
Your first? How many do you have?

172
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,850
Six. But this is my first.

173
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,490
He's a good student.

174
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,710
His friends are good students.

175
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,550
His friends aren't such
good students,Mrs.Darvashi.

176
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,780
They've both been
arrested for selling drugs.

177
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,440
But not my Amir.

178
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,760
No. Not your Amir.

179
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,440
Those two,the ones who were killed.

180
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,310
He's not like them.

181
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,140
Look at what a good
student my Amir is--All as.

182
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,530
He would have called
his mother if he could.

183
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,200
Someone is stopping him.

184
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,600
You find him.

185
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,550
You find my Amir.

186
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,980
To die that way.

187
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:12,010
To do that to another
person,that's so... terrible.

188
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,550
"Go home."

189
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,810
I was wondering if you might
know why they wrote that.

190
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,260
I suppose out of hate.

191
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,680
But it's in your store,and
that made me think,why here?

192
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,320
Could it have something to do
with this place,with your store?

193
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:34,280
Mary Ann,we have surveillance tape from your camera
before it was destroyed I'd like you to have look at it.

194
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,850
Of course. Should I come down to the station?

195
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,000
No.Actually,I have it here.

196
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,980
What--In
that?

197
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,030
Wow,that's like...

198
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,820
Living in the future?

199
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,780
Exactly.

200
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,290
Living in the future.

201
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,820
Do you know one of them?

202
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,330
Is there a way to make it closer?

203
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,080
You do. You know one
of the boys,don't you?

204
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,070
They're wearing masks.

205
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,600
But you can see their eyes.

206
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,930
That one...

207
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,380
In the middle.

208
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,290
The one who shot the camera. I know him.

209
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,500
Do you know his name?

210
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,330
It's Farmer. Jeffrey Farmer.

211
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,090
Farmer? Is he your brother?

212
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,410
No,Detective,Jeffrey...

213
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,120
Jeffrey's my son.

214
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,790
I moved here from Ojai when I
was 15,pregnant with Jeffrey.

215
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,610
I found work in a gas station.

216
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,710
I bought that gas station.

217
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,910
I bought another. Then
i bought four more.

218
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,240
Somewhere in there,Jeffrey grew up.

219
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:12,030
Somewhere in there,Jeffrey
grew away from me.

220
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:19,240
It started in high school,his hatred
of all the immigrants. Persians.

221
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,660
Do you know the names of
the people he runs with?

222
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,150
They're... they're surf rats.

223
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,490
He and his two buddies.

224
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,340
Do you know where we might look for him?

225
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,260
They live out of that van.

226
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,410
I know he did a terrible thing.

227
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,970
But you will bring
him back... won't you?

228
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,940
Wait for our call

229
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,310
Trace that. Now.

230
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,640
We're gonna help you,okay?
We're gonna find him.

231
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,080
So he's just gonna buy all this?

232
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,510
If he wants.

233
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,540
'Cause he saw it in a dream.

234
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,280
Apparently.

235
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,500
It's nice that he still has
dreams after what he came through.

236
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:30,950
I don't think I could do
what he did,be that strong.

237
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,710
I don't know. You seem
pretty strong to me.

238
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,630
Everybody turning their back on you?

239
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,910
Your own loved ones
just... walking away?

240
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,620
It's all we really have
in this world,isn't it?

241
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,430
The ones we love the ones who love us.

242
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,430
Energy out of light,huh?

243
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,720
Well,Charlie likes light.

244
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,520
I can imagine.

245
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,690
No,you can't.

246
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,560
No, I can't. Of course not.

247
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,620
How could I?

248
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,230
What is so funny?

249
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,920
It's just
that we..

250
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,350
We're surrounded by all that free energy.

251
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,870
And why is that funny?

252
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,210
Because,Ted,we're out of gas.

253
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,530
It's not funny.

254
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,270
Disposable cell phone.
Easy enough to track.

255
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,730
But they'll use a new
one next time they call.

256
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,100
Call coming in on her cell.

257
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,520
Hello?

258
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,060
We want the cash from the dope he
and his arab friends are dealing.

259
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:49,230
You tell us where it is,or Amir ends
up like his two buddies... Bang,bang.

260
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,530
It's not about keeping immigrants
out of that neighborhood.

261
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,530
It's about drugs and money.

262
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,750
What have we learned?

263
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,470
It's always about drugs and money.

264
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,480
Who let this happen?

265
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,390
Who let these two women near each other?

266
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,260
I'm sorry...

267
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,380
I just wanted to come over...

268
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,730
I just wanted to apologize.

269
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,800
I don't know what she's saying.

270
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,780
She wants to know what kind of a mother
raises a son who does such things,

271
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:36,980
what kind of a mother
raises that kind of animal?

272
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,900
Tell her...

273
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,070
Tell her that I would give my life...

274
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,530
for the life of her son.

275
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:55,280
Tell her that I know how
much she must love him.

276
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:06,740
Okay.

277
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,810
Drugs and money.

278
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,600
Go search Amir's house.

279
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,810
I think I should go.

280
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,590
Uh,you know,at some point,we'll probably
have to put you on the phone with your son.

281
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,150
We both know that would be... a mistake.

282
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,280
You're gonna kill my son,aren't you?

283
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,900
Didn't know you spoke farsi.

284
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,720
My mom's persian. She'd
speak it to me growing up.

285
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,220
What about your father ?

286
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,730
He forbid it when he was in the house.

287
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,520
My son is not a drug dealer.
He's a good student. He studies.

288
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,780
He plays video games.

289
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,590
He doesn't get into trouble.

290
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,440
Tell your mother that he is in trouble,

291
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,350
And we need her to be honest with us.

292
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,960
She says he's a good son.

293
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,260
He studies and plays video games.

294
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,790
I'll connect Amir's
computer to the LAPD server

295
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,570
So that they can access it
over in the conference room.

296
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,280
I've never seen that screen before.

297
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,670
The department doesn't let
us computer geeks have guns,

298
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,580
And they don't let you detectives
have access to this level of security.

299
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,240
Hey, reese.

300
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,870
You, me, and stark in the elevator.

301
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,560
You had a weird reaction when he
mentioned the bank of l.A. Shootout.

302
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,180
Did I ?

303
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,750
WhIch I thought it was--
I thought it was weird.

304
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,010
Because you weren't even
on the force back then.

305
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,710
Yeah, I was 12 when it happened.

306
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,820
Family stuff.

307
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,640
You know, I've been
gone a while, but, um...

308
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,920
Are computers supposed to do this ?

309
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,000
Hey,there's a computer
problem in the conference room.

310
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,290
Making funny noises.

311
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,130
There's also flickering lights involved.

312
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,750
Family stuff...

313
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,630
Bank of los angeles robbery

314
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,870
Jack reese. Dani's father.

315
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,950
Some kind of offending liquid in here.

316
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,500
This is why we don't
drink and type, people.

317
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,230
S.W.A.T. Leader, jack reese.

318
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,810
These are clean.

319
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,540
If amir was hiding drug money
somewhere, he hasn't recorded it there.

320
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,420
It's just basic business schoolwork.

321
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,080
I will say this, though.
The kid is smart.

322
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,760
Yep. Straight as.

323
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,520
Nothing in here either.

324
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,950
It's what you'd expect to find
on a 20-Year-Old's computer--

325
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,930
Music, some porn.

326
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,060
Not very good porn, though.

327
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,080
Sorry you had to see that.

328
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,160
I'll cope somehow.

329
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,250
Anything else?

330
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,070
You sure this was the only
computer in the house ?

331
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,010
Why ?

332
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,300
Well, there's references to a
file, but I can't find the file.

333
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,240
What's it called ?

334
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,190
- Farah.
- Farah ?

335
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,930
- That's a girl's name.
- And a number.

336
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,480
"Farah, level ten."

337
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,720
Level ten ?

338
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,800
She must be hot.

339
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,230
Farah.

340
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,600
No.

341
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,280
No farah.

342
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,260
And what about you, shahnaz ?

343
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,620
Does amir have any friends named farah ?

344
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,650
No, he doesn't have any
friends named farah.

345
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,940
You think there has
to be another computer.

346
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,290
There is a file reference but no
file by that name on this computer.

347
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,250
He's a good son. He studies.

348
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,940
He plays his video game. A game console.

349
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,350
It's like a computer, isn't it ?

350
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,990
Not like one. It is one.

351
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,430
It's just a hard drive with games on it.

352
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:38,860
The object of this game is
to save the princess farah.

353
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,610
You think you can get to level ten ?

354
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:44,460
DetectIve, I'm 30 years old, I
lIve wIth my mother, and

355
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,340
I have a captain kirk
costume in my closet.

356
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,980
Ted, can I ask you a questIon ?

357
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,130
Okay.

358
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,710
You seem like a nervous sort to me.

359
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,270
Do I ?

360
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,210
You were some wall street big
shot. Were you nervous back then ?

361
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,420
No.

362
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,680
Did prison make you nervous?

363
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:25,990
No.

364
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:33,180
Olivia, you make me nervous.

365
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,090
That's why I dIdn't pay
attentIon to my gas gauge.

366
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,430
That's why we're stranded out here.

367
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,590
You--You make
me nervous.

368
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,980
That's all right, ted.

369
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,610
It's human nature. It's
nothing to be ashamed of.

370
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,220
* sweet hour of prayer *

371
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,810
* sweet hour of prayer *

372
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,500
My dad used to sIng It to me
when we camped when I was a kId.

373
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,180
It's pretty. Go on.

374
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,660
- Are you sure ?
- Yeah.

375
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,740
* that calls me from *

376
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:37,740
* a world of care *

377
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,270
* and bids me at *

378
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:45,210
* my father's throne *

379
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,520
* make all my wants *

380
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,220
* and wishes known *

381
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,710
* in seasons of *

382
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,170
* distress and grief *

383
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:05,640
* my soul has often found release *

384
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,270
It's not amir.

385
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,840
It's not jeffrey.

386
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,120
Three surf rats at that gas station.

387
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,480
One of them ends up here dead.

388
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,010
Why do you kill someone
who pulls a job with you ?

389
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,230
I guess because you reach
some sort of disagreement.

390
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,330
Some sort of violent disagreement.

391
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,170
And, like davis says, it's
probably about drugs and money.

392
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,220
Yeah, I guess. Drugs and money.

393
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,940
Hello.

394
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,060
Time's up, little sister.

395
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:55,060
You gIve me what I want, or I gIve your
brother somethIng he does not want.
Got It ?

396
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,420
Tell him you found the
information about the money.

397
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,860
Tell him you'll trade
it for your brother.

398
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,910
You can do this, shahnaz.

399
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,420
Yeah ?

400
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,900
Jeffrey called in again.

401
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,760
He will exchange amir for the
information about the money.

402
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,340
You're not gonna do that.

403
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,490
Of course i'm not going to do that.

404
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,030
I am going to let them think
that we are going to do that.

405
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,130
Rose bowl parking lot. 45 minutes.

406
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:27,140
And detectives, these guys are
responsible for three deaths.

407
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,210
I'd like to end this now.

408
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,740
How long have we been awake ?

409
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,850
You sure we are awake ?

410
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:41,280
Maybe this is a dream.

411
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:45,190
Maybe life is a dream, and
we wake up when we die.

412
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,450
Sun's gonna come up soon, right ?

413
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,450
Something's not right, reese.

414
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,050
Yeah, tell me about it.

415
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,120
This is mcallister.

416
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,950
This is detective crews. Talk
to me about those spreadsheets.

417
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,270
Yeah, okay.

418
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,370
According to these spreadsheets, amir and
his friends had a nice little drug business.

419
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:20,240
Three smart usc kids, a little
business school plus a lot of drugs--

420
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,610
You got an enterprise.

421
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:26,570
So jeffrey and his surf rat friends
bought those drugs from amir and company.

422
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:31,300
Jeffrey figures amir and
company are sitting on some cash.

423
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:35,340
They take amir hostage, 'cause he was their
accountant. He knew where the money was.

424
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,550
Keep looking. There's more in there.

425
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,050
I don't think there is.

426
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,450
Well, you do something
like this to hide a secret.

427
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,370
More secret than drugs and money ?

428
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,910
Keep lookin'.

429
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,120
It's late, detective. I've looked.

430
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,470
I have a zen exercise.

431
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,580
It'll give you the energy
you need to finish this task.

432
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:57,170
Yeah. I really don't
believe in that stuff.

433
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,470
Try it. Imagine me...

434
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,210
Okay.

435
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,680
Imagine me...

436
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,470
Walking into that room you are in...

437
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,440
Imagine me walking into
that room you are in...

438
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,300
Okay.

439
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,970
And there you are...

440
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,090
Not having done what i asked.

441
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,830
Okay.

442
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,290
Okay. There's--
There's something here.

443
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,550
There's a column here that
doesn't make any sense.

444
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,580
What way doesn't it make any sense?

445
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,270
It seems to be a separate business.

446
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,800
Got about $93,000 in cash
in an offshore account.

447
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,850
It's coded with three
initials-- M.A.F.

448
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,240
I need an address.

449
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,310
Mary ann farmer.

450
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,230
M.A.F.

451
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,860
Turn the car around.

452
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,710
He's not going to that meet.

453
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,340
This is about something else.

454
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,430
He's going to his mother's house.

455
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,770
This one's not jeffrey either.

456
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,570
Where's mary ann and amir?

457
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,460
He took them in her car.

458
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:09,460
So jeffey and his surf rats fiends kill
those two persian kids and take amir.

459
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:14,870
Then jeffrey kills his two friends
and takes his mother and amir.

460
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,650
Jeffrey wants her money too.

461
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,270
He wants more than that.

462
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,110
How do you know ?

463
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:24,650
She told me.

464
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,080
Mary ann told me.

465
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:35,650
You awake ?

466
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,510
Of course. Sleep is for babies.

467
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,170
Where's the money ?

468
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,210
You mean where is it-- Physically ?

469
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,850
I guess you could say
it's in the bahamas.

470
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,450
I wish i was in the bahamas.

471
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,170
How would jeffrey get to it ?

472
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,700
Wire transfer to any bank.

473
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,800
Is that something we can track ?

474
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,240
Just sign here, here, and here,

475
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,310
And i can go get you your cash.

476
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,850
And you, mr. Darvashi, you'll be
needing a wire transfer as well ?

477
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,610
Yes, please.

478
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,690
He's gonna kill us.

479
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,720
That's right, amir.

480
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,820
He's gonna kill us as
soon as he gets the money.

481
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:26,600
It's gonna be okay.

482
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,360
No, it won't.

483
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,150
- It won't be okay. No.
- Yes, it will.

484
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:32,290
No... more...talking.

485
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,300
He's gonna kill us.

486
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:35,280
He's gonna kill us as
soon as we leave the bank.

487
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,340
I saw him kill my friend.

488
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,490
I saw him kill his own
friends. I saw him--

489
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,860
Okay, i might as well kill you now.

490
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,370
Go home ?

491
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,490
That's what you wrote on
the glass,i sn't it-- "Go home".

492
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,000
Is that what you want them to
do, or is that what you want to do ?

493
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:53,260
Do you want to go home, jeffrey ?

494
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,440
How do you know my name ?

495
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:59,230
I not only know your name, i
also know what you want.

496
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,700
I want this a-Rab dead.

497
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,310
He's persian...

498
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,930
Not arab, jeffrey.

499
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:09,580
He's a-Rab if i say he's a-Rab ! And in
about ten seconds he's gonna be dead

500
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,080
That's not what you really want.

501
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,930
What you really want is what amir has.

502
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,320
You mean his money.

503
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:18,780
I'm gonna take his money
and i'll walk outta here

504
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:22,100
And i'll put his brain on the floor.

505
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,420
That's not what i meant, jeffrey.

506
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,600
You know what i mean.

507
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,410
- You know what amir has.
- Shut up.

508
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,340
See i thought it was about the money.

509
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,290
It's always about the money-- Drugs
and the money. Isn't that right, reese ?

510
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,000
That's right.

511
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,170
But your mother told me the truth.

512
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,120
What she said is a lie.
She's made of lies.

513
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,370
She told amir's mother...

514
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,990
That she knows how she feels.

515
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:51,450
She told amir's mother that she
knows just how much she must love him.

516
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,480
Jeffrey...

517
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:57,320
Both of you shut it... now !

518
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,870
How could she know that ?

519
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,990
How could she know how
much a mother loves her son ?

520
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,370
Jeffrey--

521
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,660
I said both of you... shut up !

522
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,660
But she doesn't love you.

523
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:11,280
So she must not have
been talking about you.

524
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,750
Because she loves amir, too.

525
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:22,970
And that's what you want, isn't
it, jeffrey ? What amir has.

526
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:26,560
What your mother's giving him.

527
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:33,130
It's love, right ?

528
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:40,120
S.W.A.T. Two. I'm in position.

529
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,950
And something else too.

530
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,270
Mom ?

531
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,010
Good morning.

532
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:10,280
Amir would come into my store
when he was still in high school.

533
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:14,140
I have a lot of soft
cash in my business,

534
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:18,430
And he showed me there were better things to
do with it than keep it in a bag in my closet.

535
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,390
And you fell in love.

536
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:26,220
He wasn't like the rest of the kids.

537
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:29,000
Wasn't like jeffrey and his friends.

538
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:32,130
Amir wanted to be something.

539
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,160
He worked at it.

540
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:41,090
The kind of kid who could start out pumping
gas and end up owning six gas stations?

541
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:58,230
Yeah, i think maybe one
more just to get me home.

542
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,500
Thanks.

543
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:17,990
Going out ?

544
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,760
Yeah, yeah.

545
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,500
I got some... stuff to do.

546
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,350
Hey, did you go to the solar farm ?

547
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,080
Yeah. Yeah.

548
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,190
Do you think we can make
something out of this ?

549
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,980
Yeah. We can. Yeah.

550
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,340
I like that.

551
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:50,880
Yeah. I like it, too.

552
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,180
