Previously on life...

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,570
I'd like your permission
to sleep with jennifer.

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,830
You want to sleep with my wife.

4
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,260
No, I want to sleep
with my wife. Ex-wife.

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,630
You asked my husband
permission to have sex with me?

6
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,250
They want me to tell you,
jack, you go back a long way.

7
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,310
But not for nothing.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,270
They want me to tell you,
jack, you go back a long way.

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,980
But not for nothing, there
was six. There is five.

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,740
There could just as easily be four.

12
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,130
- That sounds like
a, uh-- - wire tap.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,860
Legal wire tap?

14
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,840
A not legal wire tap.

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,850
A not legal
wire tap on--

16
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,240
a not legal wire tap on jack reese.

17
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,130
They want me to
tell you, jack--

18
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,410
that's not jack reese's
voice though. Who is that?

19
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,540
You don't know.

20
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:04,390
Back a long way. But not for
nothing, there was six. There is five.

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,780
There could just as easily be four.

22
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,050
It was six, it is five, but it
could just as easily be four?

23
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,350
What does that mean?

24
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,060
You--you're trying
to figure that out.

25
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,010
Okay, I'm just gonna listen
now. Just--I'm just listening.

26
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,800
It's your phone. Your phone,
charlie. You gonna get that?

27
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,250
You want me to get it? I'm gonna get it.

28
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,150
Hello?

29
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,270
Okay.

30
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,080
Okay.

31
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,750
That was your partner. She
says there's a dead guy.

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,400
She wants to know if you'd like
to, uh, catch who killed him.

33
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,910
All the prisoners and guards are
accounted for. No one is missing.

34
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,910
So the killer is still here.

35
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,540
Can we just go home?

36
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,830
Kinda freaky deeky. Huh, john?

37
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,290
Oh, yeah. Kind of freaky deeky.

41
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,630
Hey, you know what this reminds me of?

42
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,910
Would that be a prison?

43
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,660
No, but yeah. 'Cause of
the cells and everything.

44
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:08,550
But what it really reminds me
of is a horror movie, you know?

45
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,200
You know, like maybe that one
with the haunted spaceship.

46
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,900
Where that freakin' gooey
head pops right out of her--

47
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,280
- bobby.
- Yeah, charlie.

48
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,770
- Murder weapon?
- Haven't found it yet.

49
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,240
I'm back looking for it.

50
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,620
"Freakin' gooey head?"

51
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,400
He was just asking if I was okay.

52
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,950
And I am.

53
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,850
It's a crime scene.

54
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,180
And we are detectives.

55
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,600
Then let us detect.

56
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,200
You have to let me in.
You don't understand.

57
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,670
You have to let me in!

58
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,880
Warden's here.

59
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,080
It ryan really dead?

60
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,260
I saw him but I thought I can't be true.

61
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,920
How did you see him?

62
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,750
From my home computer. I was on a break.

63
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,760
I saw ryan. Even on the computer,
I could see all the blood.

64
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,190
- His throat had been slashed.
- With what?

65
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,540
We haven't found the murder weapon.

66
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,130
No sharp objects were allowed.

67
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,460
Nothing that could be used as a weapon.

68
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,980
I was very careful.

69
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,520
This has never happened before.

70
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,560
You've done this before?

71
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,180
A few times, yes. Others do it as
well. There's a standard protocol.

72
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,370
Others?

73
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,600
Social psychologists.

74
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,900
The prison experiment?

75
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,200
You've read about it.

76
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,310
Something like that.

77
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,410
I recruited 20 students? I didn't
know them. They didn't know each other.

78
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,160
I randomly assigned them
roles of inmates and guards.

79
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,580
Ryan sagel was a guard.

80
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,660
You said you were observing?

81
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,590
How did you not see the murder.

82
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,380
There were built-in blackouts.

83
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,900
No more than 60 seconds.

84
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,360
After a blackout, the lights came on.

85
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,320
And I saw ryan holding his throat.

86
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,290
But something was different
this time. Wasn't it, professor?

87
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,050
Something happened down there
in that blackout to those kids.

88
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,990
Someone died, professor.

89
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,490
I'd like to go down there now to see it.

90
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,450
- Would that be okay?
- Sure.

91
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,470
We'll take you down there.

92
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,470
You know what this reminds me of?

93
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,440
let's get some sunlight in here.

94
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,310
Anything on the murder weapon?

95
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,840
Wellsy, we're a little light today.

96
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:44,410
There's only four of us and two gotta
stay in the hallway with the kids here.

97
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,970
Which only leaves two
to perform the search.

98
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,000
Well, we don't have that much time.

99
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,060
Well, we could put the kids in a cell.

100
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,000
Or not. Detectives' choice.

101
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,010
What is this?

102
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,140
It's a piano crate. We searched
it. No weapon. Also, no piano.

103
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,470
They didn't need the piano,
bobby. Just the crate it came in.

104
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,750
They must've used it for solitary.

105
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,880
Yeah, I guess. Modern education and all.

106
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,210
When I was at community college,
we made due with beer bongs.

107
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,570
Where's halliday?

108
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,740
Step away from that computer, professor.

109
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,360
Something happened down here.

110
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,090
I have to find out what it was.

111
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,380
This is not an experiment
anymore, professor.

112
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,800
This is a crime scene now.

113
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,590
And everything on that computer,
that's part of the crime scene too.

114
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,110
There were eight cameras.

115
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,740
Thousands of hours of footage.
I can be a help going over it.

116
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,080
All right, I'm gonna call the
station, get the geeks out here.

117
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,510
Sit down, please.

118
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,960
Why don't you quit acting
stupid, man. Put it on your head.

119
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,460
It's the real prison experience, right?

120
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,250
Ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna try to
get you out of here as soon as possible.

121
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,270
But for the meantime, we do
have an investigation to conduct.

122
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,730
So you're all just
gonna have to stay put.

123
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,150
Is that the law?

124
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah, it's the law.

125
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,430
hell, yes!

126
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,180
Very well said, milady.
Excellent speech.

127
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,520
Who wants to go home anyway?

128
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,710
- You ready?
- Ready ready.

129
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,620
Had a little chat with the dean.

130
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,040
They're all lawyered up.

131
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,660
In two hours, this thing's over.

132
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,020
It was a locked basement, so whoever
killed ryan sagel is still here.

133
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,540
You got two hours with those kids.

134
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,090
After that, they get legal representation
and counseling, killer or no.

135
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,540
Make sure it's not no.

136
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,910
To wit, find a murder weapon.

137
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,750
It's a locked basement.
It's gotta be there.

138
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,010
We could use some more uniforms
to help out with the search.

139
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,820
And a few bodies from tech support too.

140
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,690
We got three, count
'em, three parades today.

141
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,350
Little ethiopia, armenia,
and osaka. I got no one.

142
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,570
- And how's your day going, captain tidwell?
- What?

143
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,020
Well, thanks for asking, detective.

144
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,520
As we speak, I got an off-duty
north hollywood detective

145
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,970
being brought in for discharging
his weapon in a bar down the block.

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,660
And here's the kicker.

147
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,000
I think he's crying.

148
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,090
Abby. I need abby.

149
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,390
Is that his pistoli?
Secure it. Call his partner.

150
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,990
His partner's on the way.

151
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,880
I just want my abby.

152
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,870
Who's abby?

153
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,060
My wife. Leaving me.

154
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,570
That's the first time
I said it out loud.

155
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,490
Wife number?

156
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,650
One... and only. I just want her back.

157
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,190
I got this, guys.

158
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,820
Yeah, the first one's the toughest.

159
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,920
That's the one that usually leaves
you. Let me show you something.

160
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,350
Mia.

161
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,940
Carly.

162
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,020
Jasmine.

163
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,910
Number three usually
has a name like that.

164
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,270
Amber, jasmine, jade. You'll see.

165
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,980
Point is, all magnificent women.

166
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,870
Insane, soul-crushing,
magnificent women.

167
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,090
I want my abby.

168
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,260
- I just want her back.
- Of course you do.

169
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,810
But she's your first wife.
First wives are like chicken pox.

170
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,320
You gotta go through
'em when you're young.

171
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,060
If you wait till you're
older, you wind up sterile.

172
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,970
excuse me.

173
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,790
Are you weepy's partner?

174
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,530
Yeah, I'm the partner.

175
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,110
- Do I know you?
- You don'T.

176
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,090
Can we talk?

177
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,730
Thanks.

178
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,160
I just got someone to
come down about the video.

179
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,430
Tidwell said he had no one.

180
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,050
Oh, I know a guy.

181
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,140
You know a guy.

182
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,240
A guy who knows computers and prisons.

183
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,220
What are the odds?

184
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,610
Oh, that fella that
lives in your garage.

185
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,120
Ted is on parole and he lives
in a room above the garage.

186
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,840
And if he comes down here,
don't bring that stuff up.

187
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,860
He's very sensitive about it.

188
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,590
Well, I do pretty darn
well with the ladies.

189
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,780
In liberty city.

190
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,330
Grand theft auto.

191
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,970
I'm a chem major.

192
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,670
Been a big ten days.

193
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,620
It seems longer.

194
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,840
- Chem major?
- Yes, sir.

195
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,770
Then how come you signed
up for a psych experiment?

196
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,890
Money. $83 a day.

197
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,760
What were your dealings with ryan sagel?

198
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,260
You mean with destro?

199
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,260
That's what we called him. Destro.

200
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,340
Okay, well...

201
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,040
what were your dealings with
correctional officer destro?

202
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,490
He did his thing and I did mine.

203
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,870
He was a C. O. You were an inmate.

204
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,640
And if you called him
destro, then he must've been--

205
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,630
must've been what?Brutal?

206
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,800
Like I said, he did his thing.

207
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,020
How do you feel about
him being murdered, will?

208
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,850
To be honest, I have no feelings
about it one way or the other.

209
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,710
Man...

210
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,500
it's pretty messed up, huh?

211
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,690
There's not gonna be a test, right?

212
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,030
It's just hanging out down
there for five days, no books.

213
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,310
Hey, I'm still getting
credit for this though, right?

214
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,980
I'm a poetry major.

215
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,690
When I fill in the occupation line
on the forms, I write poet. But...

216
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,230
I don't know. I feel like other people should
say whether I'm a poet or not, you know?

217
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,430
Not me.

218
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,070
You were a guard down here?

219
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,510
Uh, correctional officer.

220
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,170
But you were a poetry
major up there, tate.

221
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,190
Destro kick you around
because you were a poet?

222
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,110
What are you kidding, dude?

223
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,700
Destro was my brother.

224
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,410
- I'd like you to take it easy there.
- You know what, sweetie?

225
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,380
I would like you to show my boy destro the
respect he deserves and find his killer.

226
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,600
Exactly what kind of poetry
are you majoring in there, tate?

227
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,850
You in the same frat as destro?

228
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,410
I was a pledge.

229
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,280
And it's "fraternity." Whole word.
You wouldn't call your country a--

230
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:54,220
I thought they said that subjects didn't
know each other before the experiment?

231
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,180
You lied to me, didn't you?

232
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,580
You corrupted this? You did this?

233
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,320
Did you do this, tate?

234
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:03,430
Let me make it simple for you.

235
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,320
You're cops. We're
correctional officers. Us.

236
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:12,090
One of those pieces of garbage
out there killed my boy D. Them.

237
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,490
There's us and there's them.

238
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,900
You did this! It was you!

239
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,420
Okay, you need to both
lower your voices now--

240
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,940
there's us and there is them!

241
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,980
Lower your voice now.

242
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,660
There is us and there is them!

243
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,780
crews!

244
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,180
- This is how it starts.
- How what starts?

245
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:37,020
Halliday! Halliday!
Halliday! Halliday! Halliday!

246
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,530
Step away from the door, professor.

247
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,630
Don't open the door.

248
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,600
I'm not asking you gain,professor.

249
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,420
- Got him?
- Yeah, I got him.

250
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:57,770
Calm down! Calm down!

251
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,670
Prison break?

252
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,870
Yeah, I think we lost one.

253
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,530
These kids sure do learn fast.

254
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,740
- now. Go.
- Move.

255
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,770
No fun being the warden, huh, warden?

256
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,660
It's professor.

257
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,810
They just threw this at me.

258
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,240
I don't even know what it
is, but they threw it at me.

259
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,760
- Oh, please
don't-- - do that.

260
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,890
- Nutriloaf.
- Nutri what?

261
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,540
Nutriloaf. Engineered to have no flavor.

262
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:48,490
Prison system uses it to punish people who
had everything else taken away from them.

263
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,530
Deprive them of flavor.

264
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,770
Get this kids some pizza.

265
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,080
And some fruit.

266
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,250
You want me to go and get it?

267
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,070
- Bobby.
- I'm on it, charlie.

268
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,230
Maybe we should get some
buffalo wings too, huh? Spicy?

269
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,830
You have one escapee. Janice. An inmate.

270
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,060
All right, contact campus security.

271
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,100
Get text alerts with her descriptions
sent out to the student body.

272
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,710
Wherever she's going, she's not going
far with everyone looking for her.

273
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,330
We have the killer right here. Tate.

274
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,650
He lied. He's got serious issues.

275
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,240
Something must've happened
between him and ryan.

276
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,940
I'd like to question him.

277
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:24,080
Oh, that's not gonna happen.

278
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,410
Bobby, keep an eye on
tate. You're the warden now.

279
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,200
With the murder weapon, prisoners
are good at hiding things.

280
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,910
Yeah, well, some of
them are guards, charlie.

281
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,690
No, they aren'T.

282
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:40,160
I believe in cartoons, french fries.

283
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,040
Kissing my boyfriend.

284
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,130
Uh, random acts of kindness. Kittens.

285
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,090
And, uh, the films of mr. Adam sandler.

286
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,470
And you haven't seen janice?

287
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,900
Not for five glorious days.

288
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
What did she do?

289
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,790
Are you here to, like,
give her an award?

290
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,290
Yeah, something like that.

291
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,440
She likes the moose.

292
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,190
She is the moose.

293
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,390
Does all the games.

294
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,730
I forgot to put "no collegiate costume
mascots" on my roommate info sheet.

295
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,420
So now I live with mitchtopher moose.

296
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,950
"Bw," new boyfriend?

297
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,600
I don't pay attention.

298
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:26,300
It's kind of like hello kitty ate the disney
channel and threw it up onto that side of the room.

299
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,940
Janice use email?

300
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,890
No, she rocks the telegraph,
there will be blood style.

301
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,640
Um, don't you need a warrant for that?

302
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,160
Oops. Bad balance. Inner ear thing.

303
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,560
Ben wise. Ben wise. Do you
know where ben wise lives?

304
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,400
Off-campus with his parents.

305
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,680
How does she make it across
campus without being seen?

306
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,010
Reese.

307
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,910
in his parents' bedroom?

308
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,500
Where we used to go?

309
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,360
Where he used to take me?

310
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,620
- You we myorst nightmare come true!
- Hey, what's going on?

311
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,550
- My worst nightmare!
- All right, cool it.

312
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,560
My worst nightmare.

313
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,510
You're not gonna charge him?

314
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,200
You want me to charge your partner?

315
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,330
I want you to uphold the law.

316
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,570
Look, the job does a
number on your life.

317
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,580
Once in a while, your life
gets to do a number on the job.

318
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,770
But it's always something with henry.

319
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,060
Yeah, like what?

320
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,550
Like that.

321
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,730
Can you handle the setup?

322
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:48,320
Operationally or, uh, emotionally?

323
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,270
Charlie wanted you to see what
happened the day before the murder.

324
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,690
Any blow-ups, arguments, such like.

325
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,540
These kids really killed someone, huh?

326
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,120
Well, one of 'em surely did.

327
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:07,020
in rahway state penitentiary I
shot a man who was mean to me.

328
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:12,580
He wouldn't let me drink my
tea and took away my cookies.

329
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,310
I'll tell you, sir.

330
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,860
All this...

331
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:22,050
has really shown me how
important the police are.

332
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,190
Thinking about law enforcement myself.

333
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,160
And what are you looking to get into.

334
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,080
Lapd. Straight up, sir.

335
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,940
Is that so?

336
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,730
Janice escapes just so she
can yell at a cheerleader?

337
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,180
Hard to believe she
slit anybody's throat.

338
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,940
My money's on the frat
boy. Our poet, tate.

339
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,600
Tate did lie to us about knowing destro.

340
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:49,060
Tate had a severe reaction
when we mentioned destro's name.

341
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,890
I think we should find out more
about those two frat brothers.

342
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,480
Let's go to the frat.

343
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,660
Let's go to the frat.

344
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,140
We need to ask you some questions
about a frat pledge.His name is tate--

345
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:18,250
no, no--no names.
Pledges have no names.

346
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,470
Yo, pledge. What's your name, pledge?

347
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,670
We took his name.

348
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,070
And if he's lucky, we'll
give it back to him.

349
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,140
Pledge, show these officers out.

350
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,330
Uh, you're not gonna help us?

351
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,800
Oh, kind of like how you helped
us get our charter suspended?

352
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:34,910
Hell no. Erthe's us...

353
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,370
and there's them!

354
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,280
I think you might want to help us.

355
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,420
And why's that?

356
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,910
- You want the short answer or the long answer?
- Short.

357
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,850
Because.

358
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,680
Okay, the long.

359
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,100
Because I am about three seconds from
deciding that I just do not like you.

360
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,360
Look, how may I help you officers?

361
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,860
- You can tell us about tate mcneil.
- Tate who?

362
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,750
He's a pledge here.

363
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,160
I don't know anybody by that name.

364
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,540
I know you had no pledge named tate because
the pledges have their names taken away.

365
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,770
But when the pledges get their names back,
will any of those names be the name Tate ?

366
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:16,030
yo, officer riddler,
there's all our pledges.

367
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,190
And your boy tate ain't one of 'em.

368
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:27,660
If tate's not a pledge, then who is he?

369
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,630
Not us and not them.

370
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:43,340
Pizza man!

371
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:48,920
Pizza man!

372
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,410
You're a lifesaver, pizza man.

373
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,480
Hey, hold on a minute.

374
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,710
You still there?

375
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,530
Charlie, where are you?

376
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:09,040
I'm in, uh--on the
job. Look, uh, jen.

377
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,770
I understand about your husband.

378
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,010
I, uh, I shouldn't have done that.

379
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,900
I--I shouldn't have
gone to him like that.

380
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:19,210
You know, sometimes
I do things, you know?

381
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,030
I know.

382
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:23,100
Yeah, well, he punched me and
you slapped me. Maybe we're even.

383
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,230
Maybe.

384
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,290
Look, charlie, I got a call from
a reporter about an hour ago.

385
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,720
Said he was doing a story on you.

386
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,170
He wanted to ask you questions?

387
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,050
Just one question, charlie.

388
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,900
About your time in prison.

389
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,290
What is the question, jen?

390
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,560
He wanted to know is it true that when
that lawyer came to visit you in prison,

391
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:47,960
and she told you she wanted to prove your innocence
that you sent her away and went back to your cell.

392
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,540
Is that true, charlie?
You didn't want to be free?

393
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,940
What did you say?

394
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,560
I told him to go to hell.

395
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,150
Officer stark says you're thinking
about a future in the lapd.

396
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,510
Yeah, thinking about it.

397
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,420
Since when?

398
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:21,640
Ever since officer stark got
given the keys to those cells.

399
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,130
You a tau sig, tate?

400
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,970
Well, there's us and there's them.

401
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,600
Turns out you're neither.

402
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,960
What was that for?

403
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,890
You know what to do
with that towel, tate.

404
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,180
Destro was strong. You said
you were a frat brother.

405
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,890
Officer stark holds the keys and
suddenly you want to be a cop?

406
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,680
That's how the weak survive.

407
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,230
Destro's dead.

408
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,480
You know what to do
with that towel, tate.

409
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,760
Destro reall wasa tau sig.

410
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:00,490
What did he do when he saw what you
drew on your leg? Did he laugh at you?

411
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,880
Never showed it to him.

412
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,450
I knew he'd make me take it off.

413
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,820
I drew it for me.

414
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,890
Like you said, I'm weak.

415
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,440
There's something you two need to see.

416
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:20,080
I'm gonna find out
who brang this crap in.

417
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,660
A few days in, a bag
of contraband shows up.

418
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,600
Candy bars, energy drinks, kettle corn.

419
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:32,640
Ryan says perry did it and he's gonna
put perry in the hole for two days.

420
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,690
Perry denies the charges.

421
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,950
Destro, I didn't do it!

422
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,830
- Oh, you didn't do it?
- No!

423
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,850
Right before they put perry in
the hole, will steps forward.

424
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,460
And will goes into the hole.

425
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,350
- Don't!
- What did you say?

426
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,940
It was me. I planted
that bag. It was me.

427
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,700
That's you?

428
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,570
but if no one was going
in and out of here,

429
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,200
neither will nor perry
could've planted that bag.

430
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,500
So where did it come from?

431
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,170
Must've come from you.

432
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,610
It was placed to heighten the dynamic.

433
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,760
- Part of the protocol?
- Yes.

434
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,720
But there was nothing in
it that could kill a man.

435
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,660
Nothing.

436
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:27,700
And will goes in the hole
for something he didn't do.

437
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,920
pal, hey, let's not get crazy here.

438
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,640
She is your first wife.

439
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:38,290
Put my gun back in the drawer.

440
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,090
I love her. Always loved her.

441
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,390
Henry, the desk you're
sitting at, it used to be mine.

442
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,420
That's how I know you.

443
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,800
This extremely professional
and sensitive individual

444
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,890
who equates women with viral infections
took a job I worked my entire life for.

445
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,090
That hurt.

446
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,970
Probably about as much
as you're hurting now.

447
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,270
You have no idea how much I hurt.

448
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,470
I do. I've been there.

449
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,340
Standing on the brooklyn bridge,
wondering what it's all about.

450
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,180
After coming home and finding most
of your life has left for jersey.

451
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,640
I know that pain.

452
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,050
But I also know something that dulls it.

453
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:16,050
Tullamore dew, the afghan whigs,
and many, many, many strippers.

454
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:19,100
You... shut the hell up!

455
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,220
Captain.

456
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,710
We're taking a side bar, henry.

457
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:29,380
His wife is a stripper.

458
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:32,320
He went with a stripper
for his first wife?

459
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,670
She was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

460
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,860
you took the heat for perry.

461
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,890
You went in the hole for
something that you didn't do. Why?

462
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,010
Why do you think?

463
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,280
People go in the hole for protection.

464
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:46,900
To get safe.

465
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:50,640
Because they think it's better to be
alone than to live in constant fear.

466
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,340
I went because it wasn't fair.

467
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:55,310
I went because perry didn't do it.

468
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,840
But why you, will?

469
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,550
Why not me?

470
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:05,070
You think this is all
part of the experiment.

471
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,080
Come on. You're too hot to be a cop.

472
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:10,210
From the theater department,
right? You were in pippin.

473
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:13,090
Man, this is so truly
and utterly awesome.

474
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,620
Was it part of the experiment when
they dragged you toward the hole?

475
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,320
It was just a snag.

476
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,870
I have a little problem
with small spaces.

477
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:23,210
Did the guards know you have
a problem with small spaces.

478
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,660
No. Why would I tell them that?

479
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,000
Destro had his frat
friends take ben out.

480
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,690
And hooked him up with that cheerleader.

481
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,710
I saw photos.

482
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,790
Destro showed it to me on his phone.

483
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,900
Did you ever tell destro or the
other guards about your boyfriend?

484
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:46,200
No. I kept that safe. Inside me.

485
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:51,580
Seeing those photos, it
was my worst nightmare.

486
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,210
Her worst nightmare.

487
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,860
It came true.

488
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,790
Perry's too.

489
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,860
On that haunted spaceship, is this the
part where people's nightmares come true?

490
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,730
No. That's a different part.

491
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,250
You smell that?

492
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,740
I can smell a lot of things.

493
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:24,410
Burning plastic.

494
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,080
What is that?

495
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:48,630
It's the murder weapon.

496
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,600
Let's send this out for prints.

497
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,070
It's a shank.

498
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,340
Melted plastic scraped to a point.

499
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,830
How would they melt it?

500
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,710
I didn't find any matches.

501
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,120
Yellow fingertips?

502
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,850
You been smoking during the experiment?

503
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,820
Show us where.

504
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,690
you snuck up here to smoke.

505
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:44,840
Yeah. We weren't supposed to though.

506
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,870
Michelle, that lighter makes you
a suspect. You understand that?

507
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,320
I'm in jail so I must've done something.

508
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,090
I didn't kill ryan.

509
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,370
Anybody see you smoking?

510
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,650
Now I'm supposed to
give up somebody else.

511
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,090
8195 saw me.

512
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,830
Will. He didn't tell on me.

513
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,520
- I don't get it.
- What don't you get?

514
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:18,330
- We were awful to him.
- We?

515
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,240
All of us guards.

516
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,490
What did you do?

517
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,290
Terrible things. Horrible things.

518
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,850
Will begged us to stop and we just...

519
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,200
we just laughed.

520
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,550
Why would I do that?

521
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,300
Why would you do that, michelle?

522
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,430
Why would you do that to will?

523
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:45,470
Destro told us halliday
wanted will broken.

524
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,400
Destro said halliday said
to do whatever it took.

525
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,780
Destro said if we
broke will, then--

526
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,640
then you've won?

527
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,280
You did it during the
blackouts, didn't you?

528
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,460
Waited until it was dark.

529
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:12,450
You think you hurt worse than
davis does? Worse than me?

530
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,800
I know I do. You don't understand.

531
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:17,550
Well, I know when my first wife
split, I wanted to die. Davis?

532
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,970
When they busted me down,
the thought crossed my mind.

533
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,730
- So why don't you just do it?
- Captain tidwell.

534
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,680
Fine. I'm gonna.

535
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,250
You think I won't do it, huh?

536
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,270
This is the last time that I am
gonna let life kick me in the teeth.

537
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,080
I saw this in a movie once.
That's a whole lot of talk, henry.

538
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,830
Why don't you do in yourself,
man?'Cause I got stuff to do.

539
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,860
So either pull the trigger and let me get a cleaning
crew in here, or get the hell out of my office.

540
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,920
It's all right.

541
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:01,280
She was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

542
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:04,870
No, she wasn'T. She was the first.

543
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,480
No bullets.

544
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,720
I don't leave loaded guns lying around.

545
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:22,100
- Then why did we-- - because
sometimes a guy's just gotta talk.

546
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:26,320
And I didn't take
your job. I took a job.

547
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,110
I was just saying that
for dramatic effect.

548
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,590
I found this under
one of my desk drawers.

549
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:41,620
You got a nice-lookin' family.

550
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,720
Now I know you.

551
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,920
Now you do.

552
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,240
You sure?

553
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,850
As a matter of fact I am.

554
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:55,860
I can tell for sure where several of the
students were when the lights went off.

555
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,130
Will was locked in the hole.
He could not have done it.

556
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,810
All right, you're
going in. Get in there.

557
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,530
Oh, my god!

558
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,410
Thanks for taking your time, warden.

559
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,640
It's professor.

560
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:48,390
You've been holding
back on us. About will.

561
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,070
What about will?

562
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,980
About what you asked
destro to do to will.

563
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,380
"Whatever it took?"

564
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,470
Is that what you told
destro, professor warden?

565
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,570
I never said that.

566
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:01,360
You told destro that if he
broke will, then he'd won.

567
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,400
Whatever it took.

568
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,630
Is that the protocol?

569
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,310
To tell one of your
guards to break a student?

570
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,880
I didn't do that. I would never do that.

571
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:11,470
The guards took some initiative,
yes. But I was just an observer.

572
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,720
I would never get involved. I
would never let it get personal.

573
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,650
Because that's the protocol?

574
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,750
Yes.

575
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,000
And that's not what you do.

576
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:23,000
Please hold.

577
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,000
Hey, jen. It's me again.

578
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:30,440
That reporter that called with
that question. He leave his number?

579
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:36,260
Blocked, huh? Yeah, thought so.

580
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,130
Hey, I had that number traced.
I texted it over to you.

581
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,270
Yeah, yeah, I'm a cop. I can do that.

582
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,520
Hey, jen, listen. Do me a favor.

583
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:49,020
After I hang up, go ahead
and give that guy a call.

584
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:51,430
Just tell him I said hi.

585
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,900
You know who I am, don't you?

586
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,960
Knew it from the first time you saw me.

587
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,980
What with you being a
social psychologist and all.

588
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:02,930
And me, well... me being me.

589
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,090
You called my ex-wife?

590
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,400
You called to talk to her about me?

591
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:12,280
About my time in prison?

592
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,150
Aren't you gonna get that?

593
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,280
I thought you were an observer.
Thought you didn't get involved.

594
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,630
You trying to break me? Is
that it? My worst nightmare.

595
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:30,720
Keeping me from doing my job.

596
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:39,750
What were you trying
to stop me from doing?

597
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,000
Professor warden, you keep
trying to get to that computer.

598
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,880
Maybe you want to tell us
what it is you're looking for.

599
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,790
I don't know what you're talking about.

600
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,080
You wanna rethink that?

601
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,980
I think I'd like to have someone from
the university come down here now please.

602
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,400
Detective reese, would you mind
stepping out and dealing with that?

603
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,330
What is this?

604
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,230
I guess you'd call it an education.

605
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,940
You studied charlie's case.

606
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,500
So you must know what happened to
that guard when he was in there.

607
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:25,530
You must also know that they
never found out who did it.

608
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,890
Sometimes in prison, people get hurt.

609
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,700
No one knows how it happened.

610
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,720
Like I said. It's an education.

611
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:44,100
Maybe you want to show us what
you don't want us to see out there.

612
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:51,450
What did you think would happen when
you gave me their personal files?

613
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,260
What did you want to happen?

614
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,770
Take their fears and use it against 'em?

615
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,090
- That's what you said!
- Ryan, calm down.

616
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,820
Take their weaknesses
and use it against them!

617
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:03,270
That's what you said!

618
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,530
Congratulations, doc.

619
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,660
Your experiment, it's a success.

620
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:13,040
'Cause now you're afraid too.

621
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,170
Whatever it takes. And now you're weak!

622
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:21,320
And now you, doc, are getting out
of my prison. Get out of my prison!

623
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:28,720
I like the part where he says
you gave him their personal files.

624
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,200
Destro took over your prison
and you didn't call for help?

625
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,190
That was part of the experiment.

626
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,510
I also like the part where he says,
"you said 'whatever it takes.'"

627
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:41,580
You made destro and then you
left those kids alone with him.

628
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,140
Congratulations. You're not
a killer. You're a coward.

629
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,780
I never said ouey cldn't leave.

630
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:49,860
And the door to this
prison was always unlocked.

631
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:55,830
They couldn't walk out because they accepted
the idea they were supposed to be in here.

632
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:02,270
I never locked anything.

633
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:08,120
You don't need locks for a prison.

634
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,970
Just prisoners.

635
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,890
Officer stark.

636
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,650
Yeah, what's up, charlie?

637
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,090
Why don't you go ahead and cuff
professor warden halliday here.

638
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,280
What? What is this?

639
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:27,660
I would imagine it's
incitement to gross bodily harm.

640
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:30,170
Seven years for each
count. I count 20 students.

641
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,050
That's 140 years.

642
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:36,760
Maybe, if you're well-behaved,
you'll get out after 120.

643
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,240
Look, detectives. I'm no
detective, but I gotta ask.

644
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,950
Who exactly is the killer?

645
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,880
If none of it was locked, then we don't know if
will really stayed in here during the blackouts.

646
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,150
Then where did he get the weapon?

647
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,750
You said it was melted plastic.

648
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:23,230
Where'd he get the plastic?

649
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,390
halliday's full of
crap. The kid's a hero.

650
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,670
He was trying to show them
that they couldn't break him.

651
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:33,560
No. Will wanted to be in
that hole again for a reason.

652
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,220
okay, there.

653
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,750
Right there. See the plastic bag there?

654
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,060
Fast-forward.

655
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:53,070
Stop.

656
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:59,450
The bag's gone.

657
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,360
Keep going.

658
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,730
I didn't say you could take it off.

659
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,240
So why don't you put it back on?

660
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,890
Will could've left the hole
during one of the black outs

661
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,460
and no one would've
known that he was gone.

662
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,750
And he knew michelle
was smoking upstairs.

663
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:29,810
So he snuck out, made the
shank out of the plastic bag.

664
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:32,900
He accepted that he was a convict.

665
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:36,010
I guess I'm a convict too.

666
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,180
Yeah, why's that?

667
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,980
Ted still thinks will is a hero.

668
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:21,150
The first three years
will be the hardest.

669
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:28,580
But just because you're in
there, you don't have to be there.

670
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,200
You can go somewhere else.

671
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:53,900
They want me to tell you, jack.
You can go back a long way.

672
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:58,950
But not for nothing, it
was six. There is five.

673
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,200
There could just as easily be four.

674
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:05,270
You can go back a long way.

675
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,150
"Go back a long way."

676
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,060
They want me to tell you, jack.

677
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:13,320
"Go back a long way."

678
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,500
They go back a long way.

679
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:39,400
There are five officers
in this photo, ted.

680
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,560
"It is five."

681
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,390
At the funeral of a slain officer.

682
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,580
"It was six."

683
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:50,590
"But it could just as easily be four."

684
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:56,590
That's a threat, charlie,
against jack reese.

685
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:59,460
That's a threat, ted.

686
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,000
Who are these guys?

687
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:12,590
