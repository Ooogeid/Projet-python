00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,260
previously on life...

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,050
aren't you that cop that
spent all that time in jail?

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,350
life was his sentence, and
life is what he got back.

4
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,610
They gave you all that
money-- like, $50 million.

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:16,000
The man who killed my friends, the
man I served those 12 years for,

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,050
what'll I do when I find him?

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,000
I killed that family,
but I didn't set you up.

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,320
It doesn't stop with him.

9
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,590
Rachel seybolt was there
the nighheof t murders.

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,940
I want to know where she is.

11
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,100
She's gone.

12
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,660
I have something you want.

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,760
The girl.

14
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,590
<font color="#ffff00">Life Season02

15
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,830
Is that a real gun?

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,170
Yes, it is.

17
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,550
Can I touch it?

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,180
No, you cannot.

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,260
He wants to be a
policeman when he grows up.

20
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,690
You ever shoot anybody?

21
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,580
Violence against one
is violence against all.

22
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:04,050
And violence against all
is violence against myself.

23
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,920
Yeah. But you ever shoot anybody?

24
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,280
Nobody...

25
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,160
that didn't have it comin'.

26
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,480
- We goin' to the river?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,860
Don't get your hopes up.

28
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,900
There isn't any water in it.

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,420
should've been here before.

30
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,960
Had about two dozen dogs
just wantin' into that trunk.

31
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,700
Animal control had to taze
a few to get 'em to back off.

32
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:52,030
So back off the mutts, cut the
lock, popped the lid, and...

33
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,280
looks like she suffocated.

34
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,630
must've been, what, 110
dein tees here at least.

35
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,530
- one.
- One what?

36
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,080
Maybe whoever did this
is starting to count.

37
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,400
It's reese.

38
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,340
All right. Get him outta there.

39
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,330
Someone's starting to count.

40
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,950
Yeah.

Driver's license.

45
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,120
Lisa robards.

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,500
Got a business card too.

47
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,320
"Unending notes."

48
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,030
"Sentiments for all occasions."

49
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,810
We're looking for
someone who knows--

50
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,020
boxes.Would that be you?

51
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,780
Yeah, that'S...

52
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,230
And you are?

53
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,690
Uh, john armstrong.

54
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,600
What can you put in a box, john?

55
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,370
Whatever you want.

56
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,880
What is that exactly?

57
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,110
Kumquat.

58
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,950
Little gem of the citrus family.

59
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,320
Got a box for that?

60
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,970
Yeah.

61
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,990
You sure? You don't seem sure.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,050
No. I'm--I'm
sure.

63
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,250
What else can you put in a box?

64
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,010
Well, you can-- we can box up
anything you want, really. I mean...

65
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,640
in prison, I knew a guy who escaped
by mailing himself out in a box.

66
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,460
Prison?

67
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,820
Why were you in prison?

68
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,120
You got a box big enough for that?

69
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,680
Big enough to fit a man?

70
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,550
Uh, I don't
understand.Why would I--

71
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,020
or a woman?

72
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,180
Who are you people?

73
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,270
Detectives. Lapd.

74
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,320
Detectives. He said he done time.

75
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,490
Trippy, huh?

76
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,050
You need some help boxing that kumquat?

77
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,940
Uh, look, to be honest, I don't
usually work the counter.So that's--

78
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,500
what is it that you usually do?

79
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,650
Uh, custom cards,
invitations, announcements.

80
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,870
Sentiments for all occasions.

81
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,890
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
Sentiments for all occasions.

82
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,220
And who usually works the counter?

83
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,750
My boss. Lisa robards.

84
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,360
When was the last time
you saw your boss, john?

85
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,160
Yesterday.

86
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,550
Uh, she's usually here first thing.

87
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,740
But she's running a little late
today. So that'S... why I'M...

88
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,610
you're not here to box
the kumquat, are you?

89
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,390
Mrs. Price?

90
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,570
I saw it on the news.

91
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,370
Just one more L.A.Story, right?

92
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,740
Nothing to do with me.

93
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,610
And then those policemen came.

94
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,360
The ones in uniform out there.

95
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,970
You're policemen, too?

96
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,450
My name's detective crews.

97
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,760
This is detective reese.

98
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,860
We're very sorry for your loss, ma'am.

99
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,760
Can you tell me, was glenn alive

100
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,780
when he was put in that box?

101
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,790
the coroner hasn't made
his report yet, but--

102
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,700
but you saw glenn. Can't
you tell if he was--

103
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,890
most likely, glenn
died from suffocation.

104
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,310
Most likely glenn was alive
when he was put into that box.

105
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,090
Thank you.

106
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,320
Do you need anything else, ms. Price?

107
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,630
No. Uh, thank you very much, susan.

108
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,380
You and your husband worked together?

109
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,830
Uh, glenn and i were both partners.

110
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,120
Power couple.

111
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,200
Can you think of anyone who'd
want to harm your husband?

112
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,530
Do you know if your husband knew
a woman named "lisa robards"?

113
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,930
I don't know that name.

114
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,660
She owned a stationary
store in hollywood.

115
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,470
You said she owned?

116
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,000
- Was she-- - one
of the others?Yes.

117
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,560
Was she alive too when she...

118
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,870
The news said there were three.

119
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,860
There was no id on the first victim.

120
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,500
We're still waiting to see if
her prints are in the system.

121
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,480
The news said they
found her in the river.

122
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,180
They call it a river, but
there's no water in it.

123
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,190
They shouldn't call it a river
if there's no water in it.

124
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,770
Why'd you tell her her husband
was alive when he went in that box?

125
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,430
'Cause she asked me.

126
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,070
Something you want to ask me?

127
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,070
{\a6}<i>Kyle.....</i>

128
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,130
did it bother you that charlie crews
served 12 years for those murders you did?

129
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,700
My lawyer says I can't talk
about stuff like that and whatnot.

130
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,950
but you've confessed to
kille seg thybolt family.

131
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,410
Confessed to a crime that
charlie crews went to jail for.

132
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:20,490
Well, like they say, if they locked
him up, he must've done something.

133
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,530
The first vic had a work visa.

134
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,690
Immigration had her prints and her
place of employment in the system.

135
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,780
Brandee huggens.

136
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,940
Detectives.

137
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,720
Someone here wants to talk to you.

138
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,220
My name's oscar tollander.

139
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,400
I work at megaluggage.

140
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:41,190
We sell suitcases, carry-ons,
garment bags, trunks.

141
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,270
What kind of trunks?

142
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,340
Like the ones I te onhe news.

143
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,320
Last month, a guy comes in for trunks.

144
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,240
Paid for his order in cash.

145
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,200
What did he look like?

146
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,290
I couldn't say.

147
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,670
Hat pulled low, big sunglasses.

148
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,030
- How many trunks were in that order?
- Ten.

149
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,260
He picked up an order of ten trunks.

150
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,510
- reese.She's
in a-- - box.

151
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,480
Did brandee go in there?

152
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,520
We all go in there.

153
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,930
Did brandee seem to mind it?

154
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,030
what do you think?

155
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,510
Go check it out for yourself.

156
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,420
Customers like it.

157
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh yeah.

158
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,270
The guys eat it up.

159
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,240
Any customers like it
more than the others?

160
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,820
no. It seems to be something
every man can agree on.

161
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,120
Us in there.

162
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,410
any customers into brandee
more than the others?

163
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,860
You know, just maybe a--
maybe a little too into her?

164
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,240
She never mentioned anything.

165
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,810
Whose idea was that box?

166
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,940
its always been here.

167
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,560
A lot of places have them.

168
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,740
Some places have a cage.
Some places have a box.

169
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,920
I guess you don't go to the clubs.

170
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,830
Oh, it's been a while.

171
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,470
Brandee would've liked you.

172
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,380
Yeah? Why's that?

173
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,020
Because you seem kind of broken.

174
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,340
What was your relationship with brandee?

175
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,320
Uh, I met her the day
she walked in here.

176
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,180
She just came down from vancouver.

177
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,010
Do you know if she had any
troubles outside of the club?

178
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,240
No, no.

179
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,330
She had that canadian thing, you know?

180
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,520
What would that be?

181
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,310
Happy for no reason.

182
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,590
I think my partner might not
be familiar with that concept.

183
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:51,000
Brandee, uh, she ever mention the
names "lisa robards" or "glenn price"?

184
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,660
Those the other two who were killed?

185
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,730
Something else you need to tell me?

186
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,900
She wanted to be an actress.

187
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,120
She just got a line in some movie.

188
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:07,670
she walked around all day
practicing that line. Remember?

189
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,110
"I never seen a sky that blue."

190
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,520
New boss wants to see us.

191
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,460
Alright. Great. Thanks, fellas.

192
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,860
Yeah!

193
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,310
Lots of dark nights of the
soul spent on this baby.

194
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,910
I brought it out with me.

195
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:33,390
I understand you were close with
the last occupant of this office?

196
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,840
Friend of the family.

197
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,910
Yeah. Real shame about her getting
demoted and all. It happens.

198
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,580
And I know all about you and your, uh,
off-the-book investigations, conspiracy theories.

199
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,940
Look, I don't know what was going on

200
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,890
while I was still living in the
united states of new york city.

201
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,270
But the only conspiracy I'm interested in is
the possibility that my wife and girlfriend

202
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,230
know about each other
and are out to get me.

203
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,560
You want us to look into that?

204
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,870
No, but I do want you to give
me the punch line to this joke.

205
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,290
An investment banker, a card shop
owner, and a stripper each go into a box.

206
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,410
Now before you get all offended
and say "it's not a joke,"

207
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,470
let me tell you, I know it's not a joke.

208
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,950
Well, as far as we can tell, the
victims had nothing in common.

209
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,850
They didn't know each other.

210
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,260
No one who knew them
seem to know each other.

211
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,530
Different parts of L.A. Different
social brackets. Different worlds.

212
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,500
No criminal records. No tax
problems. Neighbors had no complaints.

213
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,670
If any of them were worried about their
safety, they never talked to the law about it.

214
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,490
Three people chosen at random?

215
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,370
Except nothing is random.

216
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,530
Oh, here we go.

217
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,820
And why is that?

218
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,280
Because everything is connected.

219
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,600
I don't think that's true.

220
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,830
Why on earth would that be true?

221
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,060
What about, uh... where they were found?

222
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,660
Freeway, rooftop, river.Nothing
links those places, but--

223
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,790
they're public. They took time.

224
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,310
They're deliberate. Whoever's
doing this is making a show of it.

225
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,570
Tox screens on victims?

226
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,300
Clean. The coroner confirms it.

227
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,320
All three went into those
trunks alive then suffocated.

228
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,160
Slowly over the course of several hours.

229
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,910
So how'd they get there?

230
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,910
So how did they get there?

231
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,550
That's what I'm asking. You
heard me ask that, right?

232
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,710
Maybe it's not who they were.

233
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,650
It's where they were.

234
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,760
Did he just... he
just walked out, right?

235
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,160
You surf?

236
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,490
'Cause I was thinking
about checking it out.

237
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,930
And I figured if you surf, maybe
you can give me a few lessons.

238
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,060
I don't surf.

239
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,090
Reese. Come on. Come on!

240
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,350
Alright, kung fu. I'm open. Hit me.

241
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,500
glenn price, investment
banker. Brand-new m5 with gps.

242
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,330
Yellow line's glenn price's
last week of driving.

243
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:53,910
Lisa robards, card shop owner.
Two year old prius with gps.

244
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,630
Red line's lisa's last week of driving.

245
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:04,380
They were both right there. At
the same time. What is that place?

246
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,510
Public park.

247
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:07,770
And the stripper?

248
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:12,560
Dancer. Go-go dancer. Brandee huggens.
Didn't have a car. Took the subway.

249
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,870
There's no subway in L.A.

250
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,190
Yeah, there is. People ride on it.

251
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,870
So we don't know where
brandee huggens went.

252
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,270
But the other two went right here.

253
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,950
Funny what that bartender said about
brandee being happy for no reason.

254
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,730
Do you think it's possible?

255
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,670
To be happy for no reason?

256
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,490
I think I don't want
to think about that.

257
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,150
Yeah, but to not think about it
means that you are thinking about it.

258
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,320
Because the "it" that you're not
thinking about is the "it" that...

259
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,680
"I've never seen a sky that blue."

260
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,140
Okay, now you're just saying stuff.

261
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,660
Sentiments for all occasions.

262
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,700
Reese. Look at that.

263
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,360
You're not about to leave, are you?

264
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:20,280
I got another park to go
to. Schedule, you know.

265
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,810
Sure. Schedule.

266
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,240
Just let me, uh, buy one
before you take off. Come on.

267
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,940
Do you have any fruit?

268
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,730
It's an ice cream truck.

269
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,220
- Any fruit ice cream?
- Strawberry.

270
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,430
Is that real strawberry or the
artificial strawberry flavor?

271
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,890
I don't like the artificial kind.

272
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,480
I don't know. I could check.

273
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:47,090
No, never mind. How 'bout mango
ice cream? Got anything like mango?

274
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,500
you okay? You just--I don't
know, seem a little shaky.

275
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,930
Yeah. Just cold. The coolers.

276
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,050
Uh, I don't think we have any mango.

277
00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:00,130
Or papaya? Guava? Kiwi?

278
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,370
Tamarind?

279
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,080
I don't know what your friend on
the floor here is planning on doing,

280
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,190
but I'm going to count to three
and then I plan on shooting him.

281
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,400
One.

282
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,010
Be smart. Don't move.

283
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,240
You didn't say "three"!

284
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,150
You didn't even get to three!

285
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,480
You shot me on two! You
didn't even get to three!

286
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,250
He's right, you know.
You didn't get to three.

287
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,080
I rounded up.

288
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,680
Crack, huh?

289
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,740
Those brainiacs were slinging
crack off the ice cream truck.

290
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,140
But their not good for the killings.
They both got out of county this morning.

291
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,460
I got you for sellin'
smoke in a school zone!

292
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:53,360
Dude, you were out for what,
like 12 hours? Come on! Buh-bye!

293
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,460
Good work, you two. I do hate crack.

294
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,060
you got a little...

295
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,840
ice cream right in the...

296
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,030
corner of your...

297
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,850
yeah.

298
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,590
Uh, I'm gonna head back to the precinct.

299
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,630
Station.

300
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,650
Precinct, station. New york, L.A.

301
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,690
There's someone out there
with seven trunks left.

302
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,690
And I still don't know what the banker and the
card shop owner were doing in this park together.

303
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,730
- It's automatic.
- Thank you.

304
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,060
- It's not automatic.
- Thank you.

305
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,430
lucky.

306
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,420
Coming.

307
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:32,890
That ice cream guy you arrested,
he was dealing drugs? Crack?

308
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,150
I bring my son here.

309
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,080
A lot of people bring children here.

310
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,150
Do you come here a lot?

311
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,680
Every day when it's nice. It's
L.A. So, you know, it's always nice.

312
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,310
Would you mind looking
at a few pictures?

313
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,580
these are the ones from the news
that they found in those boxes?

314
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,230
Yes.

315
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,120
Do you remember seeing any of
these people here at the park?

316
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:00,390
Can you imagine being
closed up like that?

317
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,790
It's like a nightmare.

318
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,130
Him. I saw him here.

319
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,260
Last week over by that
statue. I-I saw him.

320
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,080
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

321
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,910
Because a man with no kids...

322
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,800
my "mom radar" goes up.

323
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,470
Well, what was he doing?

324
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,160
Having his picture taken.

325
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,590
She was taking it.

326
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,970
Do you remember seeing her here?

327
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,650
No. Just these two.

328
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,710
The investment banker's having an
affair with the card shop owner.

329
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,740
Uh, the wife finds out
and kills them both.

330
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,360
And puts them in a box?

331
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,260
- What about the dancer?
- The stripper.

332
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,930
Glenn price was an
investment banker, crews.

333
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,200
I mean, I'm pretty sure his tastes
weren't exclusive to card shop owners.

334
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,090
He's doing the stripper.
The wife finds out.

335
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,260
And puts her in a box? Thanks.

336
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,090
The wife's not answering
any of her phones.

337
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,380
A unit rolled by the
house, no one's home.

338
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,650
But security at the building's
got her going in the office.

339
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,580
At night?

340
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:10,300
*********

341
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,320
I don't know either of these women.

342
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,590
Neither do I.

343
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,610
you think glenn was seeing
this lisa robards woman?

344
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,490
They were seen together. Yes.

345
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,920
If I would've known, I would
have been happy for him.

346
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:45,180
We were dissolving our
personal relationship.

347
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,790
Differences in lifestyle?

348
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,790
Clearly.

349
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,380
I want things... need things...

350
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,250
glenn had no interest in.

351
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,830
Did it make you angry that he
wouldn't give you what you need?

352
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,120
We loved each other. But...

353
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,700
love has nothing to do with need.

354
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,600
That's right.

355
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,220
He'd taken a job in london.
It was a big step up.

356
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,400
He was going to try to be happy.

357
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,830
We--we
both were.

358
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,550
can I ask you something?

359
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:17,380
You wanted to know if glenn was still
alive when he went into that box.

360
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,080
Do you think he went in there for you?

361
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,880
The way glenn was found...

362
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,690
the kind of things I want, I wondered,

363
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,940
did he go looking for
something to make me happy?

364
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,610
Did he go looking for
something and end up...

365
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,150
does everyone have a secret?

366
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,670
You wanna know mine?

367
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,210
Which one?

368
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,640
You know which one.

369
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,750
The one about my father?

370
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:06,540
The one about my father having something to
do with... you going to prison for 12 years?

371
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,970
- Reese-- - did I
say I wanted to know?

372
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:17,110
{\a6}<i>Constance........</i>

373
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,640
can I ask you about the girl?

374
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,680
Which girl?

375
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,950
The daughter of the murdered
family. Rachel seybolt.

376
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,590
She went into children's
services... when she was nine.

377
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,810
Was adopted when she was 11.

378
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,260
And then she disappeared.

379
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,800
I don't know anything about that.

380
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,790
Is detective crews looking for her?

381
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,750
I think I hired every private
investigator in los angeles.

382
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,620
Any idea what that costs?

383
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,720
Money is not a man's worth, ted.

384
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,900
It hurts me when you talk like that.

385
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,280
700,000 it costs.

386
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,850
Those are dollars.

387
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,660
Ted, I have 50 million dollars.

388
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:48,140
More than that, actually. I've grown it.

389
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,680
Okay, they, uh, they
tracked rachel here.

390
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:55,710
From what the pis co uld tell,
that's where jack was holding her.

391
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,670
Then they lost her.

392
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,280
She vanished.

393
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,030
So is this what it's like to be a cop?

394
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,910
It's more fun with this.

395
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,580
Can I help you?

396
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,180
we need to ask you some questions.

397
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,060
Can I help you? I run this
house. There's problem?

398
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,690
Uh, we're looking for a girl.

399
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,850
What country from is she?

400
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,300
She's american. She'd been injured.

401
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,660
We have foreigners only.

402
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,810
If she's american,
she's not been here ever.

403
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,930
Well, we'll just take a look around.

404
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:18,100
You hold any magic mushroom?

405
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,010
Magic mushrooms?
We--we're cops!

406
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,680
Then grass?

407
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,890
Charlie, she's not here.

408
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,020
Ted, this seem like a really strange
place to hold someone captive?

409
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,870
our fourth victim. Kurt ruiz. Just
18 years old. Found at the airport.

410
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,790
- Connection to the other three?
- None.

411
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,120
He wasn't seen in that park.

412
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:11,770
This kid, he grew up in eagle
rock, nowhere near the others.

413
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,820
He's younger too. He was a senior
in high school. Kind of a track star.

414
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,810
He had a full ride to
run for ucsd next year.

415
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,650
That kid had everything to live for.

416
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,240
What did you say?

417
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:25,510
Yeah, I know. We all have
everything to live for, right?

418
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,780
No. Not like this kid.

419
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,960
And...

420
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,230
is he gonna walk out again?

421
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,820
It's not... where they were.

422
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,680
It's not what they were.

423
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:47,970
What if it's what they were about to be?

424
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,430
Yeah, and what would that be?

425
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,220
They were about to be happy.

426
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,440
Just got a full scholarship.

427
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:59,180
Just got her first line in a movie.

428
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,260
New job. New life in london.

429
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:04,840
What did his wife say to us? That
we're gon-- gonna try to be happy.

430
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:08,950
Okay, grasshopper. But what about
lisa robards? The card shop owner?

431
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,490
How is she about to be happy?

432
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,590
Let's go find out.

433
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,290
John.

434
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,920
Detective kumquat.

435
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,010
- You packin' up?
- Yeah.

436
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,730
With lisa gone, we'll have to close.

437
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,810
john, do you ever remember
seeing lisa with this man?

438
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,990
Or mentioning his name, glenn price?

439
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,930
It's possible. I don't know.

440
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,750
Lisa and I didn't really mix socially.

441
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,570
But you and lisa worked together, right?

442
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,670
I mean, long hours in the store.

443
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,420
And people who work together know more
about each other than most married couples.

444
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,990
You know, relationships.
What their hopes are. Secrets.

445
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,920
I'm sorry I-I haven't seen this guy.

446
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,000
I wish I could help you.

447
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,640
John, do you know if lisa was
planning a change in her life?

448
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,760
What kind of change?

449
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,680
Oh, new job. New home.
Something to make her happy.

450
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,480
No. If she did, she
didn't mention it to me.

451
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,640
I mean, we only worked together.

452
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,110
okay. Thank you.

453
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,610
You know, if you think of anything that
might be helpful, just give us a call.

454
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,700
Sentiments for all occasions?

455
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,140
Invitations? Announcements?

456
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:31,920
Excuse me?

457
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:33,560
That's what you do, right, john?

458
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,420
Invitations. Announcements.

459
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:39,390
So if there was a graduation party for a
high school kid, you might do the invites.

460
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,310
Well, if it were special enough. Sure.

461
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,210
Full ride to ucsd special enough?

462
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,270
I don't understand. A full ride?

463
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,510
Or a moving announcement?

464
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,980
Some guy gets a new job; a new life.

465
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:53,420
- You know what my partner's thinking?
- You know what I'm thinking?

466
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:57,990
Is that when people are
happy, they want to celebrate.

467
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,400
And when they want to celebrate,
they need to let people know.

468
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:06,130
Invitations. Announcements.

469
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:06,910
John.

470
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,060
You're going to wanna see
my customer list. Yeah.

471
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,730
I'd like to see it too.
I can't find it anywhere.

472
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,800
Lisa left the business in such a mess, I
don't really know what's what around here.

473
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,790
Okay, john.

474
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,090
Well, you find that list, you
send it right over to us, okay?

475
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,640
Sure thing, detective.

476
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,120
I got your "person of interest."

477
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,620
well, you watch him. I wanna
know everywhere he goes.

478
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:43,130
He leaves, you go with
him. Do not lose him.

479
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,890
There may be another trunk out there.

480
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,230
I'm on it, detective.

481
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,520
Everywhere he goes, I go.

482
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:51,800
You have my solemn vow
I will not lose him.

483
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,770
We don't need the customer list.

484
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,270
If the victims had their
invitations made at unending notes,

485
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,550
I'm pretty sure we know some
of the people they sent them to.

486
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,310
You're not closing, are you?

487
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,740
Yeah. It--it's my birthday. I'm--I'm off
to the party. Everyone's coming. You know.

488
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,700
But it's the middle of the day.

489
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,290
No. Not my birthday. My, uh,
anniversary-- that's why I have to...

490
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:24,220
no. I'm--I'm moving. Yeah.
Overseas. Ow, u knlondon.

491
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:28,610
Uh, uh, a new start. A
new job. New life for me.

492
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,050
I have to go.

493
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,570
I'm getting married.

494
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,140
Happiest day of my life.

495
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,640
Unending notes.

496
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,810
Does that mean anything?

497
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,610
It means somebody lied to me.

498
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,740
Well, I guess they're in trouble then.

499
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,550
I guess they are.

500
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:24,240
You got him there, bobby?

501
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,640
your boy did not come
out of the ore,charlie.

502
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,670
He's in there.

503
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,550
Thanks, bobby.

504
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,620
Got your warrant right here.

505
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,340
Guess what.

506
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,550
He's not the only armstrong
lives in the building.

507
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,250
His mother lives right downstairs.

508
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,230
Maybe she's got a key.

509
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,790
Is it always the guy
who lives with his mom?

510
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,160
I've never seen a sky that blue.

511
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:09,000
I've never
seen a sky--

512
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:11,300
- I've never seen a sky...
- who is this girl?

513
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,580
that's brandee huggens.

514
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,260
Has my john done something to her?

515
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:19,220
I've never seen a sky that blue.

516
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:22,490
I've never seen a sky that blue.

517
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,840
Lisa robards. Birthday
party. Everyone's invited.

518
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,240
Brandee huggens. Come
celebrate my big break.

519
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,770
Glenn price. New city. New life.

520
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,160
Kurt ruiz. Graduation party invite.

521
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,270
All four victims.

522
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,510
There's one more here.

523
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:45,770
Wedding invitation.

524
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,680
Still alive.

525
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,230
Not getting away from
us that easy, john.

526
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,110
Crews.

527
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:42,420
The four from up there plus the one
we found at armstrong inn. That's five.

528
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,750
Plus the other four make nine.

529
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:47,400
There's still one more trunk out there.

530
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,930
The marriage is tomorrow.

531
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,940
We figured she was just nervous.

532
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,680
Janie left this morning.

533
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,080
Here she is.

534
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,180
Can you bring our janie
home to us, please?

535
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:00,910
It was only this morning.
She might still be alive.

536
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,600
Where's that trunk, john?

537
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,220
You know there's a woman in that trunk,
john, and she might still be alive.

538
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,590
So let me tell you something.

539
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,520
You wanna tell me where
that trunk is, john.

540
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:17,180
Don't you look at him. You look
at me. You look at me, john.

541
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,460
found some evidence.
From your apartment here.

542
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,950
Where's the trunk, john?

543
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,140
evidence.

544
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,460
Oh, here's the, uh, graduation party invite you
did for that kid that we found out at the airport.

545
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,520
Where's the girl, john?

546
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,860
got the one you did for brandee.

547
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,440
"Come celebrate my big break."

548
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:33,040
"It's one line; but it's my line."

549
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,610
Oh and here's the one
you did for glenn price.

550
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,440
Look, there he is on the
front. Standing by that statue.

551
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,440
I guess your boss lisa
took that picture for him.

552
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,730
You did good work, john.

553
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,950
Sentiments for all occasions.

554
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:48,170
Must've been tough though. With all
those people about to be so happy.

555
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,440
Going to london. Gettin'
married. Full-ride scholarship.

556
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,230
When was the last time
you were happy, john?

557
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,290
Look, here's the one you
did for your boss, john.

558
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,310
For lisa.

559
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,600
Birthday party.

560
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:02,290
"I'm turning the big 3-0
and everyone's invited."

561
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,450
Didn't invite you did she, john?

562
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,150
No. Lisa saw fit not to.

563
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,570
Where's the trunk,
john? Where's the girl?

564
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,270
it goes back before lisa. Right, john?

565
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,780
Do you remember the
last time you were happy?

566
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,720
it's been a long time, hasn't it, john?

567
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,460
Can you remember being happy?

568
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,120
I'm gonna tell you something.

569
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:31,650
You're going to prison, john.

570
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,360
For a very long time.

571
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,910
And you are not going to be happy there.

572
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,660
You will never be happy there.

573
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:42,160
How is that going to be any
different than the rest of my life?

574
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,770
It's going to be
different, john. Believe me.

575
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,480
But we have something for
you. Something you want.

576
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,700
What's that?

577
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:52,820
You can be happy. Here. Right now.

578
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,390
You can be a hero, john.

579
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:56,730
You can save that girl.

580
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,650
you wanna be happy, john?
You've wanted it your whole life.

581
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,480
Now here's your chance.

582
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:04,530
But you have to take it before she dies.

583
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,220
No. You don't understand.

584
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,710
What I did to those people.

585
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,480
It made me smile.

586
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:18,190
And the thought of that girl...

587
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,450
out there... in a box...

588
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:26,500
right now...

589
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,110
well, that just makes me smile too.

590
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,860
His mother? What could his
mother possibly say to him?

591
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:50,240
It's what he could say to her.

592
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,590
Tell them where the trunk is, john.

593
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:04,320
You can't make me do that.

594
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:07,880
Tell them where the trunk is, john.

595
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,790
It's okay, mom.

596
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,690
No. Don't be sad. It's okay.

597
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:25,570
It's a smile.

598
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:30,130
It's all one big smile.

599
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,680
What'd you say there, john?

600
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,460
The building downtown.

601
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:19,690
Where we found lisa robards. Here.

602
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,770
That's where we found kurt ruiz.

603
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:23,170
The L.A.River basin.

604
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,510
Where we found brandee. The 405
freeway. Where we found glenn price.

605
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,130
It's all one big smile.

606
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,410
We wanna find the girl,
we look right here.

607
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,120
Could you imagine spending
time in a box like that?

608
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,100
Nice.

609
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,950
Oh, because of him being in the...

610
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,800
yeah.

611
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,090
He's lucky to have you as a partner.

612
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,380
I hope to have someone in
my life like that someday.

613
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,470
- What?
- What?

614
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,560
I know you care about her, kyle.

615
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:35,590
I know you want rachel to be safe.

616
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,780
You don't know nothing.

617
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:40,070
I know you're afraid.

618
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,670
You've been locked up.

619
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,890
You know all they got
in this place is fear.

620
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,530
No. You're afraid of
something. Someone else.

621
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,920
Is it jack reese?

622
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,150
Never heard that name.

623
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,300
Captain jack reese, kyle.

624
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,240
You worked for him. You killed for him.

625
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,470
I never heard that name.

626
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,360
Until you spoke it just now.

627
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:04,380
Listen, hollis.

628
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,910
We both know you told me
you worked for jack reese.

629
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,080
I killed those people
because I wanted to.

630
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:13,590
No one made me.

631
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,510
You're afraid of what he'll do.

632
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,480
My life's in the lord's hands.

633
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,510
You're afraid of what
jack reese will do to her.

634
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,040
Then help me find rachel.

635
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,440
You?

636
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,670
You stay away from that girl.

637
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,160
The lord told me to sav cthathild.

638
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:35,310
The lord sent me to take her from foster
care to atone for what I'd done to her family.

639
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,700
To atone for the blood that I had shed.

640
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:41,270
The fire of the lord spoke to me!

641
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,430
The fire said, "raise
that child as my own."

642
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:48,950
Said, "shed my love on her even
as I'd shed the blood of her kin."

643
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:52,750
You stay away from her.

644
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,380
You stay away from
her! Stay away from her!

645
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,970
you spend a lot of time
in a small space, you know,

646
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:03,830
like a cell, you get a
feeling for the size of a room.

647
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,740
How big or small it is.

648
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,500
I remember that.

649
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:14,930
This room, ted.

650
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,880
It's smaller than the
room on either side.

651
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,610
Charlie.

652
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:48,470
It's okay, rachel.

653
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,870
It's okay.

654
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:03,350
Stop it! No! No!

655
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,850
The fire sent me.

656
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,980
The fire sent me.

657
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,700
The fire sen meto get you.

658
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:24,180
To take you from here.

659
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,090
Hey, it's okay.

660
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,130
- Ted.
- Yeah, charlie.

661
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:42,200
If anyone tries to stop us, you can
go ahead; take my gun and shoot 'em.
