1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,327
Hard to believe something so
small could cause so much pain.

2
00:00:11,426 --> 00:00:13,768
It only hurts when it's
where it's not supposed to be.

3
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:16,548
And where's that bullet
supposed to be next?

4
00:00:17,798 --> 00:00:19,936
I could've killed you
if i wanted to.

5
00:00:20,035 --> 00:00:22,972
Didn't hit anything vital.
- Same here.

6
00:00:23,092 --> 00:00:25,697
So are we done
shooting each other?

7
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,834
Yeah, i think so.

8
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,481
I need you
to do something for me.

9
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:35,027
My partner.
- Detective reese.

10
00:00:35,147 --> 00:00:36,773
She's on loan
to you fbi guys.

11
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:38,988
Some kind of
organized crime task force?

12
00:00:39,088 --> 00:00:42,554
And you want me to do what?
- Find out what kind some kind is.

13
00:00:42,674 --> 00:00:45,029
Why would you
want to know that?

14
00:00:46,203 --> 00:00:49,181
I think then i'll know
where this is supposed to be.

15
00:00:52,498 --> 00:00:54,244
I got it.

16
00:00:59,814 --> 00:01:04,056
The coroner's transpo guy
was making a delivery when he found him.

17
00:01:05,113 --> 00:01:08,140
"Jonah grant.
Assistant coroner."

18
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,631
Lots of people
get killed at work.

19
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:13,022
He just happened to work here.

20
00:01:13,122 --> 00:01:16,335
Blunt force trauma.
Perfect circle wound.

21
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:18,638
Some kind of hammer, maybe?

22
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:21,027
Weird, though.
Not a lot of blood.

23
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,900
There's something
wrong with him.

24
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:26,008
Yeah, he's dead.
- Something else.

25
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,504
He looks... deader.

26
00:01:28,603 --> 00:01:30,678
Deader?
- More dead.

27
00:01:30,798 --> 00:01:33,862
Extra dead.
- Well...

28
00:01:34,448 --> 00:01:36,888
he's got another wound here.

29
00:01:37,008 --> 00:01:39,712
Looks like, uh...
- Where a shunt went in.

30
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:41,922
Shunt?
- Shunt.

31
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:45,388
A device used to introduce
or extract fluids from a body.

32
00:01:45,487 --> 00:01:48,470
And you are...?
- Tom santos, assistant coroner.

33
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,663
I'm going to have to ask you to
wait outside with one of the officers.

34
00:01:52,309 --> 00:01:55,561
Extract fluids? Like blood?

35
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:58,131
Yes, very good. Blood's a fluid.

36
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,806
It appears the wound
to the head killed jonah.

37
00:02:00,926 --> 00:02:03,605
But he was rapidly exsanguinated
directly there after.

38
00:02:03,705 --> 00:02:04,706
Exsanguinated.

39
00:02:04,806 --> 00:02:05,908
His blood was taken?

40
00:02:06,008 --> 00:02:07,143
From the looks of him,

41
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:09,227
i'd say jonah was drained
just about dry.

42
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:11,647
Extra dead.

43
00:02:11,746 --> 00:02:13,749
Well, i guess we'll
have to make two reports.

44
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:15,667
Homicide, and...

45
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:18,620
robbery.

46
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,106
Someone stole his blood.

47
00:02:31,247 --> 00:02:33,614
why would someone
take his blood?

48
00:02:35,584 --> 00:02:37,102
Do you know how they do it?

49
00:02:37,202 --> 00:02:39,438
His heart would've stopped,
so there'd be no pressure.

50
00:02:39,537 --> 00:02:40,773
You'd need an external pump
to get

51
00:02:40,872 --> 00:02:43,809
the pressure back up to
exsanguinate him.

52
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:46,145
Is the pump something
you'd have in here?

53
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:48,047
Yeah,
but it's usually broken.

54
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:50,249
I had to use
a bike pump last week.

55
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:51,951
Maybe you
want to take a break.

56
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,186
We were short-handed before,

57
00:02:54,286 --> 00:02:56,521
losing grant
means i'm down a coroner.

58
00:02:56,621 --> 00:02:58,958
I have to do his work
and my work.

59
00:02:59,057 --> 00:03:00,559
And we're at a hiring freeze.

60
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:02,310
The county won't
let me hire a replacement.

61
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:05,731
Do not touch... touch that.

62
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,366
Candle wax?

63
00:03:07,465 --> 00:03:09,401
Maybe from someone's
birthday cake.

64
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:11,337
You eat cake in here?

65
00:03:11,436 --> 00:03:12,972
We're like any office.

66
00:03:13,071 --> 00:03:14,106
Just because we deal
with corpses

67
00:03:14,206 --> 00:03:16,375
doesn't mean we're not fun.

68
00:03:16,474 --> 00:03:18,377
We are fun.

69
00:03:18,476 --> 00:03:20,246
Why was doctor grant
in the morgue?

70
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:23,249
I don't know; checking on
bodies, finishing up paperwork.

71
00:03:23,348 --> 00:03:24,350
Anyone else have access
to the crypt?

72
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:25,484
Everybody.

73
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:26,852
There's no lock on the crypts.

74
00:03:26,952 --> 00:03:28,387
There's no locks on most doors.

75
00:03:28,486 --> 00:03:29,822
What about
surveillance cameras?

76
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:31,390
You can't have cameras
in a coroner's office,

77
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:33,125
except in designated rooms.

78
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:35,694
To protect the dead's privacy.

79
00:03:35,794 --> 00:03:37,263
Do you know how many people
i've had to fire

80
00:03:37,362 --> 00:03:38,764
for taking cell phone shots?

81
00:03:38,863 --> 00:03:40,665
Did doctor grant
have any enemies?

82
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:43,102
He was a coroner's coroner.

83
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:45,871
He liked the dead
more than the living.

84
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:48,274
He still went out in the field,
even though he didn't have to.

85
00:03:48,373 --> 00:03:50,609
Where were you last night?

86
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,177
Sleeping.

87
00:03:52,277 --> 00:03:54,179
Now you'll excuse me,
i've been doing paperwork

88
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:55,580
for two years.

89
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,764
I don't want to slip.

90
00:04:01,637 --> 00:04:03,238
Why would they
take his blood?

91
00:04:09,245 --> 00:04:10,495
Quo kept working
while we talked to her

92
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:12,464
about grant's death.

93
00:04:12,564 --> 00:04:14,449
A lot of people use work
as a painkiller.

94
00:04:16,185 --> 00:04:18,404
Me, i use painkillers for pain.

95
00:04:18,503 --> 00:04:19,887
And you use work for work?

96
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,242
You're very certain,
aren't you?

97
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:24,276
Of what?

98
00:04:24,376 --> 00:04:25,544
Of everything.

99
00:04:25,643 --> 00:04:28,080
No, just the things
i'm certain of.

100
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,298
You sure about that?

101
00:04:31,934 --> 00:04:32,968
They took his blood?

102
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:37,556
Holy hannah.

103
00:04:37,655 --> 00:04:39,458
It is ripe in here.

104
00:04:39,557 --> 00:04:40,859
It's supposed
to be 30 degrees,

105
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,128
but with the doors
opening and closing, it's 38.

106
00:04:43,228 --> 00:04:44,997
Stuff goes bad faster.

107
00:04:45,097 --> 00:04:46,231
Like meat in your fridge.

108
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:48,334
Like meat.

109
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:49,801
That's all we are really.

110
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:51,437
Hey, how're we doing
on that autopsy?

111
00:04:51,536 --> 00:04:54,573
I'm lining up
the ventura county coroner,

112
00:04:54,672 --> 00:04:56,108
but it's gonna take a few days.

113
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,910
We can't use any of
the coroners from this office

114
00:04:58,009 --> 00:04:59,227
because they're all suspects.

115
00:05:00,596 --> 00:05:03,315
How exactly does the nose
smell things anyway?

116
00:05:03,415 --> 00:05:04,416
You don't want to know.

117
00:05:04,516 --> 00:05:05,451
Why?

118
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,068
You just don't.

119
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:09,989
No circular objects.

120
00:05:10,088 --> 00:05:11,639
Whatever the killer used
isn't here.

121
00:05:19,915 --> 00:05:23,351
People doing time.

122
00:05:28,024 --> 00:05:29,208
Court ordered community service.

123
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:32,111
Dui's, unruly conduct,
first-time arrests.

124
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,545
Junior offenders.

125
00:05:33,645 --> 00:05:35,796
Maybe someone stepped up.

126
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,219
There's no eating in the lab.

127
00:05:40,318 --> 00:05:42,687
I can still smell it
out here.

128
00:05:42,787 --> 00:05:45,324
That's just the particles
lodged in your nose.

129
00:05:45,424 --> 00:05:46,959
Particles?

130
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:48,276
Particles of what?

131
00:05:49,711 --> 00:05:50,862
Are they always here?

132
00:05:50,962 --> 00:05:52,931
If we're here, they're here.

133
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:56,001
Hoping to get a shot
of some od'd rock star.

134
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:58,003
Let's keep a lid on this.

135
00:05:58,103 --> 00:05:59,804
Anybody asks, grant fell
and hit his head.

136
00:05:59,904 --> 00:06:02,557
Every murder case we do
goes through this office.

137
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,918
Goth?

138
00:06:13,017 --> 00:06:15,120
What?

139
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,155
Your scene.

140
00:06:16,254 --> 00:06:17,356
My scene?

141
00:06:17,456 --> 00:06:19,691
Is... is it goth?
It is, isn't it?

142
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,393
I don't have a scene.

143
00:06:21,493 --> 00:06:23,195
We all have a scene.

144
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:24,596
Yeah, what's yours?

145
00:06:24,696 --> 00:06:27,166
It's complicated.

146
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:30,569
Like a puzzle with
a missing piece, you know?

147
00:06:30,668 --> 00:06:32,337
No, i don't.

148
00:06:32,437 --> 00:06:35,441
It's dark, right?

149
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,709
Goth...it's dark?

150
00:06:37,809 --> 00:06:41,413
"Fiera schwartz, arrested
for drunk and disorderly

151
00:06:41,513 --> 00:06:44,083
"outside a club
called 'bleak.'"

152
00:06:44,182 --> 00:06:45,350
that a goth club?

153
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,319
Yeah, drunk and disorderly.

154
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:49,354
So now you think
i killed that death doc.

155
00:06:49,454 --> 00:06:51,223
I'm just asking questions.

156
00:06:51,323 --> 00:06:53,725
Where were you last night
between 4:00 and 6:00 a.m.?

157
00:06:53,825 --> 00:06:57,196
that was the middle
of the night, i was asleep.

158
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:58,564
Where were you?

159
00:06:58,663 --> 00:06:59,864
Working on your puzzle?

160
00:06:59,964 --> 00:07:01,733
You got a mouth on you.

161
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,102
Thanks.

162
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:05,804
Guess i don't have
to be drunk to be disorderly.

163
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:08,073
Court ordered
community service...

164
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:09,874
next time i'm asking for jail.

165
00:07:09,974 --> 00:07:11,610
Eh, you're not having fun?

166
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:14,813
The coroners, the transpo
guys hit on me all the time.

167
00:07:14,912 --> 00:07:16,648
With dead people around,
it's gross.

168
00:07:16,748 --> 00:07:18,317
Did doctor grant
ever hit on you?

169
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,919
No, he just yelled at me.

170
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:22,187
What a jerk.

171
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:23,888
If you find the guy
who killed him,

172
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:25,306
thank him for me.

173
00:07:29,845 --> 00:07:31,597
Hey, what were you drinking?

174
00:07:31,696 --> 00:07:32,931
When you were
drunk and disorderly.

175
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:35,383
Bloody marys.

176
00:07:39,288 --> 00:07:41,073
You will know when i know.

177
00:07:41,172 --> 00:07:42,790
Okay, that's all i can tell you.

178
00:07:44,826 --> 00:07:45,810
You having a party?

179
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,912
Yes, we are.

180
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:49,181
And you're just
in time for the pinata.

181
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:50,315
So why don't
you go get a stick,

182
00:07:50,415 --> 00:07:52,033
and then hit me
over the head with it.

183
00:07:55,471 --> 00:07:57,055
You seem a little stressed.

184
00:07:57,155 --> 00:07:59,891
Maybe you wanna try this
breathing exercise i know.

185
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:01,075
It's... it's pretty easy.

186
00:08:02,944 --> 00:08:04,129
Detectives?

187
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:05,631
That's right.

188
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,132
With cases handled
by the morgue.

189
00:08:07,232 --> 00:08:08,767
Two for two,
detective seever.

190
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:10,435
As of my last cup of coffee...

191
00:08:10,535 --> 00:08:12,070
which was my eighth
cup of coffee...

192
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,005
the chief instructed me
to instruct

193
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:15,407
every one of my detectives,

194
00:08:15,507 --> 00:08:17,342
that every one
of their current and past

195
00:08:17,442 --> 00:08:19,511
cases may be thrown into doubt.

196
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:20,612
That's a legal term.

197
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:22,381
It means "screwed."

198
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,183
Maybe you want to sit down.

199
00:08:24,282 --> 00:08:25,700
I am sitting down.

200
00:08:27,503 --> 00:08:29,655
We took statements from
all the employees.

201
00:08:29,754 --> 00:08:30,822
Alibis?

202
00:08:30,922 --> 00:08:32,157
Time of death
was four in the morning...

203
00:08:32,257 --> 00:08:33,325
most people were asleep.

204
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:34,626
Those miscreants on the lawn?

205
00:08:34,726 --> 00:08:36,161
No one with a serious record.

206
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:37,296
Alibis?

207
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:38,979
Still four in the morning.

208
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,067
Grant dies, the cases
they're working on

209
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,535
get thrown out of court.

210
00:08:43,635 --> 00:08:47,088
So what was grant
working on now?

211
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:54,179
You really know
a breathing exercise?

212
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,247
Yeah.

213
00:08:55,347 --> 00:08:56,948
Just breathe.

214
00:08:57,048 --> 00:08:59,701
Said it was easy.

215
00:09:01,337 --> 00:09:04,156
The case grant was currently
working on is errol brand.

216
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,424
Celebrity chef.

217
00:09:05,523 --> 00:09:07,159
He's got those restaurants
and that show.

218
00:09:07,258 --> 00:09:09,060
Brand new kitchen.

219
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,862
When do you have time
to watch tv?

220
00:09:10,962 --> 00:09:13,165
In the morning before work
while i'm on the rowing machine.

221
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:14,299
In the morning?

222
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,034
Actually,
it's closer to four am,

223
00:09:16,134 --> 00:09:18,337
so i guess everyone
isn't asleep.

224
00:09:18,436 --> 00:09:21,873
You know, brand also has
one gunshot wound

225
00:09:21,973 --> 00:09:23,074
to the back of his head.

226
00:09:23,174 --> 00:09:24,610
But no exit wound.

227
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:25,844
Small caliber.

228
00:09:25,943 --> 00:09:27,346
How small?

229
00:09:27,445 --> 00:09:29,881
It doesn't say.
I'm not familiar with this case.

230
00:09:29,981 --> 00:09:30,949
It was doctor grant's.

231
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:32,800
May i?

232
00:09:38,206 --> 00:09:40,308
She's a very fast reader.

233
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,563
Entry wound, no exit wound,

234
00:09:44,663 --> 00:09:45,930
no bullet recovered.

235
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,047
No bullet?

236
00:09:49,084 --> 00:09:52,853
Someone shoots the chef,
then digs the bullet out.

237
00:09:55,223 --> 00:09:56,608
Didn't work out?

238
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,143
No.

239
00:09:58,242 --> 00:09:59,745
Turns out i'm not fbi material.

240
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:00,979
Well that's too bad,

241
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:03,282
i know you wanted this
to help you move up.

242
00:10:03,381 --> 00:10:04,783
Yeah.

243
00:10:04,882 --> 00:10:06,117
Well, i got somewhere i belong.

244
00:10:06,217 --> 00:10:07,286
So when you coming back?

245
00:10:07,385 --> 00:10:08,620
In a few days.

246
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,339
There's just a few things
i need to finish up.

247
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:14,192
There still room
for me in your car?

248
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:16,444
Right behind the wheel.

249
00:10:25,854 --> 00:10:27,739
Birthday cakes, condoms...

250
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,256
i guess they are fun.

251
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:39,150
Crews gets close
to your father, he disappears.

252
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,203
Crews gets close to rayborn,
he disappears.

253
00:10:44,707 --> 00:10:46,491
Maybe it's just coincidence.

254
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:47,793
Maybe they aren't connected.

255
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:50,195
Everything's connected.

256
00:10:50,294 --> 00:10:51,646
Excuse me?

257
00:10:55,283 --> 00:10:56,702
Nothing.

258
00:10:56,801 --> 00:10:59,019
Well, maybe it's nothing,
and then all this goes away.

259
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,058
Crews trusts you?

260
00:11:06,328 --> 00:11:07,579
Then let him tell you the truth.

261
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,348
You're doing the right thing.

262
00:11:09,447 --> 00:11:10,882
What's that?

263
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:13,735
Your job, detective reese.

264
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,425
Errol brand, celebrity chef,
had that show,

265
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:22,861
those restaurants, and a gunshot
wound to the back of the head.

266
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,063
He also had something else...

267
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:27,165
an investor named jimmy ellison.

268
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:29,901
Did mr. Ellison invest in
anything other than errol brand?

269
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:31,770
Mr. Ellison
invests in gambling.

270
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,621
He was the biggest bookie
in the county.

271
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,196
All that gambling money
sure does buy a nice place.

272
00:11:49,671 --> 00:11:51,222
We're looking
for jimmy ellison.

273
00:11:51,322 --> 00:11:54,308
Hector, who turned off
my music?!

274
00:11:55,744 --> 00:11:57,429
I already talked
to you cops about errol.

275
00:11:57,529 --> 00:11:58,764
I didn't do it.

276
00:11:58,863 --> 00:12:02,367
You got no proof i did,
you gotta leave me be.

277
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:03,568
We're not
here about errol brand.

278
00:12:03,668 --> 00:12:04,870
We're here about jonah grant.

279
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:05,970
Who the hell is that?

280
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,038
The coroner.

281
00:12:07,138 --> 00:12:08,473
The coroner?

282
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:09,641
We're here
about something else, too.

283
00:12:09,741 --> 00:12:12,176
Yeah, what would that be?
Blood.

284
00:12:12,276 --> 00:12:14,829
So why don't you show us
what you got behind your back?

285
00:12:27,553 --> 00:12:29,538
ed,
mr. Jimmy just stays back there,

286
00:12:29,638 --> 00:12:33,075
drinking his wine, listening
to opera, cutting meat.

287
00:12:33,175 --> 00:12:34,610
That's all he does?

288
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,478
Sometimes.

289
00:12:36,578 --> 00:12:38,229
Sometimes he cries.

290
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,420
How you doing, jimmy?

291
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,457
You wanted to shoot me.

292
00:12:48,557 --> 00:12:51,426
You cops just can't wait
to shoot someone.

293
00:12:51,526 --> 00:12:54,063
Actually, 97% of
all cops never use their gun.

294
00:12:54,163 --> 00:12:55,364
Except on the range.

295
00:12:55,463 --> 00:12:56,932
You talk like a lawyer.

296
00:12:57,032 --> 00:12:58,768
You'll have to cut that out
if you wanna be mayor.

297
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:00,335
She wants to be mayor?

298
00:13:00,435 --> 00:13:01,570
15-year plan.

299
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,139
You'll just be going up
for parole.

300
00:13:03,238 --> 00:13:04,273
What's with the meat, jimmy?

301
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:05,708
Sitting back here getting drunk,

302
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:07,143
cutting all this meat.

303
00:13:07,242 --> 00:13:08,778
Errol died back here, right?

304
00:13:08,877 --> 00:13:10,862
What's with
all this meat, jimmy?

305
00:13:13,232 --> 00:13:16,152
Errol had
a way of cutting meat.

306
00:13:16,251 --> 00:13:18,353
So tender.

307
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:19,955
Melt in your mouth.

308
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:23,159
Never taste meat like that again

309
00:13:23,258 --> 00:13:25,127
well if you miss it so much,
you shouldn't have shot him.

310
00:13:25,227 --> 00:13:26,662
Where's the bullet, jimmy.

311
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:28,964
Did you get the coroner
to dig it out for you?

312
00:13:29,064 --> 00:13:30,232
And then you killed the coroner.

313
00:13:30,332 --> 00:13:31,466
I don't know
what you're saying.

314
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:32,968
Where's the coroner's blood?

315
00:13:33,068 --> 00:13:34,637
I don't know
what you're saying.

316
00:13:34,736 --> 00:13:36,672
Errol gets shot
in the freezer,

317
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:39,474
staggers back out
into the kitchen,

318
00:13:39,574 --> 00:13:44,796
and dies right here.

319
00:13:46,498 --> 00:13:49,151
Where's the bullet, jimmy?

320
00:13:49,251 --> 00:13:51,187
That is my cleaver.

321
00:13:51,286 --> 00:13:52,855
This is my meat.

322
00:13:52,955 --> 00:13:56,058
This is my place!

323
00:13:56,158 --> 00:14:00,645
Take your cuffs
and get out of here.

324
00:14:08,454 --> 00:14:12,441
Hector, turn my music back on.

325
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,860
Loud!

326
00:14:24,103 --> 00:14:25,621
He was cutting meat?

327
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,289
And crying.

328
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:29,391
Ellison gets
that bullet back,

329
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:30,492
he's gonna get rid of it.

330
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:32,294
But why take
the coroner's blood?

331
00:14:32,394 --> 00:14:34,646
He was cutting meat
and crying.

332
00:14:36,348 --> 00:14:37,633
Anything interesting
in there?

333
00:14:37,732 --> 00:14:39,550
Well, yeah, there is.

334
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,373
A tabloid shot,
much closer to the ground.

335
00:14:44,472 --> 00:14:48,144
There's something in here

336
00:14:48,243 --> 00:14:51,380
that's not in the police photos.

337
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:53,448
Under his right hand, see?

338
00:14:53,548 --> 00:14:55,718
A puddle of something
on the floor.

339
00:14:55,817 --> 00:14:56,986
Blood?

340
00:14:57,085 --> 00:14:58,120
No.

341
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,722
Look at the police photos,

342
00:14:59,821 --> 00:15:01,056
there's no blood on his hand.

343
00:15:01,156 --> 00:15:02,825
Who took that picture?

344
00:15:02,925 --> 00:15:05,928
Uh, kathy white.

345
00:15:06,028 --> 00:15:07,663
This is mine.

346
00:15:07,762 --> 00:15:09,165
How'd you get past the cops?

347
00:15:09,264 --> 00:15:10,766
I got a pretty smile.

348
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:12,601
How'd you find
the killing?

349
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:14,937
Did you use a police scanner?

350
00:15:15,037 --> 00:15:16,272
Well, you can get
those online,

351
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:18,974
but i've always
had this weird ability

352
00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:21,143
to know when people
are gonna die.

353
00:15:21,243 --> 00:15:22,611
Really?

354
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:23,813
Yeah.

355
00:15:23,912 --> 00:15:25,396
Ever since i was a little girl.

356
00:15:26,632 --> 00:15:28,317
Am i gonna die?

357
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:29,467
I mean soon?

358
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,570
What's the possible upside
of asking a question like that?

359
00:15:33,973 --> 00:15:35,490
You really want to know?

360
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,210
Yeah, yeah.
I really want to know.

361
00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:49,238
No...not you.

362
00:15:49,338 --> 00:15:51,289
Not soon.

363
00:15:53,826 --> 00:15:56,578
But somebody very close
to you is gonna die.

364
00:15:56,678 --> 00:15:58,196
Soon.

365
00:16:04,036 --> 00:16:05,221
Your photo of the dead chef...

366
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,472
we need to see
the digital file it came from.

367
00:16:09,742 --> 00:16:11,026
Why so close to the ground?

368
00:16:11,126 --> 00:16:13,329
That's where we all end up
when we're dead.

369
00:16:13,428 --> 00:16:15,564
So i like to get
right down in there.

370
00:16:15,663 --> 00:16:17,215
Can you enlarge this section?

371
00:16:21,254 --> 00:16:23,205
You were
at the morgue yesterday.

372
00:16:23,305 --> 00:16:25,007
I'm at the morgue a lot.

373
00:16:25,107 --> 00:16:27,692
You didn't happen to know
that doctor grant was gonna die?

374
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:30,145
No.

375
00:16:30,245 --> 00:16:31,680
But those morgue boys
are so covered in death,

376
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,797
it's hard to tell.

377
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,967
Is it true
someone took his blood?

378
00:16:37,469 --> 00:16:38,387
There.

379
00:16:38,486 --> 00:16:40,089
Slide that over.

380
00:16:40,188 --> 00:16:43,658
It's a clear liquid.

381
00:16:43,758 --> 00:16:45,410
What is that?

382
00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:51,000
They swabbed the chef's hand,

383
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:52,201
nothing.

384
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:54,003
No substance on it at all.

385
00:16:54,102 --> 00:16:56,238
So it's a clear liquid...

386
00:16:56,338 --> 00:16:58,841
that leaves no trace,
that we like to call...

387
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,109
water.

388
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:01,944
It evaporated by the time
they got to the morgue,

389
00:17:02,044 --> 00:17:04,046
so it would
not have been noticed.

390
00:17:04,146 --> 00:17:06,949
So he got shot in there,
stumbled out,

391
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:08,166
and scoop a handful of water?

392
00:17:36,062 --> 00:17:37,612
He reaches down for this...

393
00:17:37,712 --> 00:17:39,214
someone comes up
behind him...

394
00:17:39,314 --> 00:17:40,365
shoots him in the head.

395
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,840
What?

396
00:17:53,412 --> 00:17:54,645
Hand me that melon,
would you?

397
00:18:01,053 --> 00:18:04,073
He reaches down, stands up,

398
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:05,656
and...

399
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:17,419
the chef stumbles out.

400
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:22,791
He reaches back,
pulls it out...

401
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:26,061
falls, dies,

402
00:18:26,161 --> 00:18:28,630
icicle's melt by the time
anyone gets there,

403
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,999
puts the puddle under his hand.

404
00:18:30,098 --> 00:18:32,884
And no bullet in his head.

405
00:18:34,553 --> 00:18:36,687
So who took
the coroner's blood?

406
00:18:49,835 --> 00:18:52,870
I want to thank you
for coming back.

407
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,358
I was wrong.

408
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,027
What i did last time.

409
00:18:58,126 --> 00:19:01,563
Uh, ask me anything you want,

410
00:19:01,663 --> 00:19:03,748
any way you want.

411
00:19:06,585 --> 00:19:08,137
Let me just ask you
one question, though.

412
00:19:08,236 --> 00:19:11,040
Your eyes are very red.

413
00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:12,741
You're not on drugs.

414
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,943
I'm not prying,
this is a legal matter.

415
00:19:15,043 --> 00:19:15,944
I'm on parole...

416
00:19:16,044 --> 00:19:18,147
no, i am not on drugs.

417
00:19:18,246 --> 00:19:19,814
Now what do you remember
about your parents?

418
00:19:19,914 --> 00:19:21,933
Why are your eyes so red?

419
00:19:23,502 --> 00:19:25,720
Has she been...crying?

420
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,857
You know, i saw a lot
of crying in prison, ann.

421
00:19:28,957 --> 00:19:30,159
A lot.

422
00:19:30,258 --> 00:19:32,361
I know what it looks like.
You have been crying.

423
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:33,695
No, i have not been crying.

424
00:19:33,795 --> 00:19:34,796
I think you have.

425
00:19:34,896 --> 00:19:35,864
I'm just tired.

426
00:19:35,964 --> 00:19:37,699
Those are not tired eyes.

427
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,150
They are,
the baby keeps me up.

428
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:45,156
The baby?

429
00:19:47,893 --> 00:19:48,960
Your baby?

430
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,164
I'm a grandfather?

431
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:58,035
Doesn't your husband help you?

432
00:20:19,258 --> 00:20:21,459
About what kathy white said
about someone close to me,

433
00:20:23,162 --> 00:20:25,481
it didn't have to be you.

434
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,683
There are
a lot of people close to me.

435
00:20:28,783 --> 00:20:32,221
You just, you know, happened
to be standing close to me...

436
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,173
at the time.

437
00:20:39,178 --> 00:20:41,613
There actually aren't a lot
of people close to me.

438
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:45,350
I guess there should be more.

439
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,406
I've been away.

440
00:20:51,506 --> 00:20:53,975
Complaints,
filed against jonah grant.

441
00:20:54,075 --> 00:20:55,993
27 of them.

442
00:20:57,663 --> 00:20:59,615
Complaints filed by...

443
00:20:59,714 --> 00:21:03,051
grant's been dead for
two days and you just discover

444
00:21:03,151 --> 00:21:05,220
i filed all those
complaints against him.

445
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,090
Geniuses.

446
00:21:08,189 --> 00:21:10,859
Well, maybe now you can tell
us why you hated doctor grant.

447
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:13,095
He wasn't my dream slab mate.

448
00:21:13,194 --> 00:21:14,496
Slab mate?

449
00:21:14,596 --> 00:21:17,099
We used to have our own labs,
now we have to double up.

450
00:21:17,198 --> 00:21:18,133
Budget cuts?

451
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:20,001
Yeah, like you know.

452
00:21:20,101 --> 00:21:21,303
Cops get everything.

453
00:21:21,403 --> 00:21:22,704
Helicopters, guns.

454
00:21:22,804 --> 00:21:24,540
We have to buy
our own toilet paper.

455
00:21:24,639 --> 00:21:26,808
Cheap, scratchy.

456
00:21:26,908 --> 00:21:28,510
I'm sorry to hear that.

457
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,779
Yeah, tell my ass
you're sorry, ma'am.

458
00:21:30,878 --> 00:21:33,014
Oh, that
must've been grant's.

459
00:21:33,114 --> 00:21:34,116
Typical.

460
00:21:34,215 --> 00:21:35,817
Is this what
you complained about?

461
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:37,653
No.

462
00:21:37,752 --> 00:21:41,356
I complained about
grant's practical jokes.

463
00:21:41,456 --> 00:21:42,824
Practical jokes?

464
00:21:42,924 --> 00:21:44,092
Yeah, brilliant stuff.

465
00:21:44,192 --> 00:21:46,361
Fingers in my coffee mug,
cranial cap saucers,

466
00:21:46,461 --> 00:21:48,630
hiding my pen
down an esophagus.

467
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,732
I filed numerous
complaints against him

468
00:21:50,832 --> 00:21:52,100
for creating
a hostile workplace.

469
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,803
Doctor quo did nothing.

470
00:21:54,902 --> 00:21:55,937
Why not?

471
00:21:56,037 --> 00:21:57,272
Grant did all her work
for her.

472
00:21:57,372 --> 00:21:59,708
They were "buds."
They're all "buds" around here.

473
00:21:59,807 --> 00:22:02,144
Confederacy of dunces.

474
00:22:02,243 --> 00:22:05,547
Doctor quo knew that you
and grant didn't get along?

475
00:22:05,647 --> 00:22:06,915
Oh, yes.

476
00:22:07,014 --> 00:22:09,251
She said i was the one
being unreasonable.

477
00:22:09,351 --> 00:22:11,820
Well, you see
how that worked out.

478
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,555
She ignored the problem,

479
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:15,990
and grant got himself
murdered in the office.

480
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,327
Chickens coming home to roost.

481
00:22:18,426 --> 00:22:21,396
You seem almost happy
about that.

482
00:22:21,496 --> 00:22:24,866
I won't pretend
to mourn doctor grant.

483
00:22:24,966 --> 00:22:26,635
You know, he used
to kick me out of the lab?

484
00:22:26,735 --> 00:22:29,003
He said i "harshed his buzz."

485
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,272
And you went?

486
00:22:30,372 --> 00:22:31,540
I had to.

487
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,674
He had seniority.

488
00:22:32,774 --> 00:22:34,142
Your statement
said that you were home

489
00:22:34,242 --> 00:22:35,277
when grant was killed.

490
00:22:35,377 --> 00:22:38,028
It was 4:00 a.m.
Where were you?

491
00:22:39,465 --> 00:22:41,015
Which equipment is yours,

492
00:22:41,115 --> 00:22:42,351
and which was doctor grant's?

493
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:46,488
My equipment is the
newer-looking, well-maintained,

494
00:22:46,588 --> 00:22:49,340
clean equipment,
engraved with a small "s".

495
00:22:50,776 --> 00:22:52,961
Doctor grant's
is everything else.

496
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,764
Could any of these tools
leave a perfect circle wound?

497
00:22:55,863 --> 00:22:57,633
That would be a bone mallet.

498
00:22:57,732 --> 00:22:59,635
Do you have a bone mallet?

499
00:22:59,734 --> 00:23:01,536
I do; it's usually here.

500
00:23:01,636 --> 00:23:03,772
But grant was
always moving my things.

501
00:23:03,871 --> 00:23:05,741
So you don't
have a bone mallet.

502
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,310
No. I have one.

503
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,061
I just don't know where it is.

504
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:41,443
Circular head.

505
00:23:41,543 --> 00:23:43,994
And engraved
with a small "s".

506
00:23:49,849 --> 00:23:51,215
Recognize this?

507
00:23:55,254 --> 00:23:56,305
It's mine.

508
00:23:56,404 --> 00:23:58,941
Why does lapd
always ask questions

509
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,309
they know the answers to?

510
00:24:00,408 --> 00:24:01,577
Why do you think we do it?

511
00:24:01,677 --> 00:24:02,645
Because
you're stupid and lazy.

512
00:24:02,744 --> 00:24:04,046
You take something obvious,

513
00:24:04,145 --> 00:24:06,348
and then you flail around
until a d.a. Pays attention.

514
00:24:06,448 --> 00:24:09,184
The coroner's office does
a perfectly acceptable job.

515
00:24:09,284 --> 00:24:11,186
If there's a way to blow a case,

516
00:24:11,286 --> 00:24:13,889
the lapd will find it.

517
00:24:13,989 --> 00:24:17,626
We found your prints
on this mallet.

518
00:24:17,726 --> 00:24:19,795
Well, you would.
It's my mallet.

519
00:24:19,895 --> 00:24:21,397
And grant's skin and blood.

520
00:24:21,496 --> 00:24:24,232
Which i forgot to wash off.

521
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:27,937
I assure you, had i killed him,
i would've made time.

522
00:24:28,036 --> 00:24:29,872
I'm very good at prioritizing.

523
00:24:29,972 --> 00:24:31,674
You complained.
Nothing was done.

524
00:24:31,773 --> 00:24:33,275
That made me angry.

525
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,543
Not stupid.

526
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:36,211
Angry people
don't think clearly.

527
00:24:36,311 --> 00:24:37,913
They grab
the first thing they can

528
00:24:38,013 --> 00:24:39,548
and smash it
into someone's skull.

529
00:24:39,648 --> 00:24:41,450
I'm quite aware of that.

530
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:45,087
I've overseen
a few murder cases

531
00:24:45,186 --> 00:24:48,524
including, by the way,
many that your squad handled.

532
00:24:48,624 --> 00:24:51,494
How clearly are you thinking?

533
00:24:51,593 --> 00:24:53,662
Are you threatening us?

534
00:24:53,762 --> 00:24:55,865
I don't know.
Am i?

535
00:24:55,964 --> 00:24:57,232
Convict me, and i will

536
00:24:57,332 --> 00:25:01,169
personally put 200 guilty
killers back on the street.

537
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:03,539
And why on earth would
i take that man's blood?

538
00:25:03,639 --> 00:25:06,157
Do you even know what
five quarts of blood looks like?

539
00:25:18,504 --> 00:25:19,455
Ten pints.

540
00:25:19,554 --> 00:25:20,990
Five quarts.

541
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:22,290
Fruit punch.

542
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,759
Don't think there's
any fruit in it, though.

543
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:25,561
Are you gonna drink that?

544
00:25:25,661 --> 00:25:26,795
I wanted to see
what it looked like.

545
00:25:26,895 --> 00:25:28,263
Am i supposed
to understand that?

546
00:25:28,363 --> 00:25:29,498
No.

547
00:25:29,598 --> 00:25:32,034
I mean yes, but...no.

548
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:34,436
What did you find out
about reese?

549
00:25:34,536 --> 00:25:36,955
About the organized crime
task force?

550
00:25:38,524 --> 00:25:39,642
There isn't any.

551
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:41,143
There's no current cooperation

552
00:25:41,242 --> 00:25:43,679
between the fbi and lapd at all.

553
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:45,581
I've seen
surveillance video of reese,

554
00:25:45,681 --> 00:25:47,583
going in and out of the
building, so i know she's there.

555
00:25:47,683 --> 00:25:50,819
But there's no records she's
there on official business.

556
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:53,638
Officially,
reese isn't there at all.

557
00:25:56,475 --> 00:25:57,993
You gonna
drink those here, honey,

558
00:25:58,093 --> 00:25:59,711
or should i get them to go?

559
00:26:02,882 --> 00:26:04,800
All it is
is stupid office politics.

560
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,234
I didn't even think it mattered.

561
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:09,137
I need santos.
I have bodies piling up.

562
00:26:09,237 --> 00:26:10,639
I didn't even have time
for lunch.

563
00:26:10,739 --> 00:26:12,340
He accused you
of incompetence.

564
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,076
Santos thinks
everyone's incompetent.

565
00:26:14,175 --> 00:26:16,244
I'm making too much money.
I'm trying to screw him.

566
00:26:16,344 --> 00:26:18,329
Did you ever work in an office?

567
00:26:19,966 --> 00:26:21,249
Do you think santos
killed grant?

568
00:26:21,349 --> 00:26:23,752
I haven't had much time
to think about it.

569
00:26:23,852 --> 00:26:25,536
Why don't you take the time
and think about it now?

570
00:26:26,606 --> 00:26:27,739
Please.

571
00:26:30,776 --> 00:26:32,728
If this job
teaches you anything,

572
00:26:32,828 --> 00:26:34,863
anyone's capable of murder.

573
00:26:34,963 --> 00:26:36,748
I find that kind of sad.

574
00:26:39,585 --> 00:26:41,070
With grant dead...

575
00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:44,073
santos is senior coroner
with a pay bump.

576
00:26:44,172 --> 00:26:46,008
I guess that's motive, huh?

577
00:26:46,108 --> 00:26:47,676
You have
some new equipment here.

578
00:26:47,776 --> 00:26:49,745
It must be expensive,
this stuff.

579
00:26:49,845 --> 00:26:51,113
I'm sure it is.

580
00:26:51,212 --> 00:26:53,482
Purchasing the equipment
was doctor grant's job.

581
00:26:53,581 --> 00:26:54,817
But there's a budget crisis.

582
00:26:54,916 --> 00:26:56,051
So if you've
got no money coming in,

583
00:26:56,151 --> 00:26:57,252
how'd you buy this equipment?

584
00:26:57,352 --> 00:26:59,488
As i said,
it was doctor grant's job.

585
00:26:59,587 --> 00:27:01,106
We need to see his records.

586
00:27:04,877 --> 00:27:07,578
It's a lot...
five quarts.

587
00:27:09,715 --> 00:27:11,600
Ten pints, 160 ounces.

588
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,968
You can't drink it
all at once.

589
00:27:13,068 --> 00:27:16,371
I mean, not in blood.
In fruit punch.

590
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:18,140
It's a lot.

591
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:20,375
There is no record in here
of any money coming in

592
00:27:20,475 --> 00:27:22,111
or the purchase of new
equipment.

593
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,411
But there is
no equipment out there,

594
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:24,929
so how did grant pay for it?

595
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:30,285
"We'll be seeing you."

596
00:27:30,385 --> 00:27:33,271
How will they be seeing us?

597
00:27:38,277 --> 00:27:39,427
Should i leave the room?

598
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:40,963
No, no, come over here.

599
00:27:41,063 --> 00:27:43,265
Will i be laying down too?

600
00:27:43,364 --> 00:27:44,366
No.

601
00:27:44,465 --> 00:27:45,868
Pretend i'm dead.

602
00:27:45,967 --> 00:27:47,069
Should i pretend to be sad?

603
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:48,436
No.

604
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:50,539
Pretend i'm dead.
Pretend you're a coroner.

605
00:27:50,638 --> 00:27:51,690
What do you do?

606
00:27:55,027 --> 00:27:56,045
Does your phone
have a camera now?

607
00:27:56,144 --> 00:27:57,345
Yeah, five megapixels.

608
00:27:57,445 --> 00:27:58,446
Is that a lot?

609
00:27:58,546 --> 00:28:00,348
It's mega.
So yes, it is.

610
00:28:00,448 --> 00:28:01,566
Hold on.

611
00:28:12,812 --> 00:28:15,664
That's where we all end up
when we die.

612
00:28:15,764 --> 00:28:18,000
So she likes to get down there.

613
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,784
That's what kathy white said.

614
00:28:22,521 --> 00:28:23,588
Oh, god!
I'm...

615
00:28:25,157 --> 00:28:27,792
sorry... i'm... i'll come back.

616
00:28:33,432 --> 00:28:35,684
They're all low angle
and close to the ground.

617
00:28:35,784 --> 00:28:37,452
Like the position
a coroner would be in

618
00:28:37,552 --> 00:28:39,054
when examining a body.

619
00:28:39,154 --> 00:28:41,590
Maybe kathy white didn't need
to be on the scene to get these.

620
00:28:41,689 --> 00:28:44,193
Maybe she wasn't the one
taking these pictures.

621
00:28:44,292 --> 00:28:45,944
Maybe she was buying them.

622
00:28:49,314 --> 00:28:51,033
We can check your financials.

623
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:52,434
My what?

624
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:55,037
Your bank account,
credit cards...

625
00:28:55,137 --> 00:28:56,138
you can just do that?

626
00:28:56,238 --> 00:28:57,472
We can just do that.

627
00:28:57,572 --> 00:28:59,708
We're the police.
She's a lawyer, too.

628
00:28:59,808 --> 00:29:01,877
Is it gonna show payments
from you for those photos?

629
00:29:01,977 --> 00:29:04,780
Because looking
at these photos of yours

630
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,649
up here on these walls,
they're really stunning.

631
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:10,318
But the photos in the paper,
not your best work.

632
00:29:10,418 --> 00:29:12,054
Not your work at all, right?

633
00:29:12,154 --> 00:29:14,806
Look, you don't need
to check my financials, okay?

634
00:29:17,176 --> 00:29:19,094
I paid grant
to take those pictures.

635
00:29:19,194 --> 00:29:20,763
It's competitive out there.

636
00:29:20,862 --> 00:29:23,498
He needed the money,
and i needed the pictures.

637
00:29:23,598 --> 00:29:24,767
Where were you
when he was killed?

638
00:29:24,866 --> 00:29:27,602
It was four
in the morning, i was...

639
00:29:27,702 --> 00:29:28,987
asleep?

640
00:29:31,757 --> 00:29:33,041
Why would i kill him?

641
00:29:33,141 --> 00:29:34,893
He needed the money,
and i needed the pictures.

642
00:29:36,028 --> 00:29:38,881
Just... just out of curiosity,

643
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,149
what would i be worth dead?

644
00:29:40,248 --> 00:29:42,633
Six figures.

645
00:29:44,203 --> 00:29:45,203
Six figures?

646
00:29:47,006 --> 00:29:48,157
But not anytime soon?

647
00:29:48,256 --> 00:29:51,009
No, not anytime soon.

648
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,514
So, he left you?

649
00:29:58,517 --> 00:30:00,384
For a dog walker.

650
00:30:03,555 --> 00:30:05,756
Ann, what's a dog walker?

651
00:30:07,927 --> 00:30:09,611
She walks dogs.

652
00:30:09,711 --> 00:30:12,547
She walks dogs.

653
00:30:12,647 --> 00:30:13,731
For a living?

654
00:30:16,836 --> 00:30:19,587
And he doesn't
help with the baby?

655
00:30:19,687 --> 00:30:21,489
He doesn't want
to see the baby.

656
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:23,959
He doesn't want
to see the baby?

657
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:26,394
He doesn't want to see me.

658
00:30:26,494 --> 00:30:28,947
He doesn't want to see you?

659
00:30:31,851 --> 00:30:34,285
Ann, what's the baby's name?

660
00:30:37,689 --> 00:30:38,756
Ted.

661
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,592
You can go home
when you solve it.

662
00:30:57,692 --> 00:30:59,677
I am not reopening those cases.

663
00:31:09,989 --> 00:31:11,055
Can i ask you something?

664
00:31:12,657 --> 00:31:13,758
Is it about prison?

665
00:31:15,127 --> 00:31:16,245
Fruit?

666
00:31:16,344 --> 00:31:17,346
Zen?

667
00:31:17,445 --> 00:31:19,597
No, it's about tidwell.

668
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:22,717
Is it true
he's dating your partner?

669
00:31:22,817 --> 00:31:25,020
Well, that would be
against regs.

670
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,938
Yeah, it would be.

671
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,210
You know what else
is against regs?

672
00:31:33,845 --> 00:31:35,264
Vodka in the lab.

673
00:31:35,363 --> 00:31:38,300
And condoms in the stairwell.

674
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,135
That lab needs money.

675
00:31:40,235 --> 00:31:42,220
What else were they selling?

676
00:31:48,127 --> 00:31:49,878
You know
what that adds up to?

677
00:31:49,978 --> 00:31:51,862
I have a pretty good idea.

678
00:32:33,172 --> 00:32:34,156
Fiera schwartz?

679
00:32:34,255 --> 00:32:36,074
Party in a morgue?

680
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,645
I guess your scene
is pretty dark after all.

681
00:32:50,264 --> 00:32:51,916
Are you shane banks?
Jesus!

682
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:53,867
You scared the hell out of me.

683
00:32:56,003 --> 00:32:57,688
I think you might be
in the wrong truck, pops.

684
00:32:57,788 --> 00:33:00,257
First of all, it's grandpops.

685
00:33:00,357 --> 00:33:02,426
And you know who i am?

686
00:33:02,525 --> 00:33:06,446
I'm the grandpops
you didn't want to meet.

687
00:33:10,618 --> 00:33:13,137
My scene is just money.

688
00:33:13,237 --> 00:33:16,322
They all paid a lot
to be in here; $250 each.

689
00:33:17,591 --> 00:33:18,609
To dance with the dead?

690
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,177
It makes them feel
more alive.

691
00:33:20,277 --> 00:33:22,113
Them?
Not you, fiera?

692
00:33:22,212 --> 00:33:24,448
You're just about the money.

693
00:33:24,547 --> 00:33:26,550
Grant ever catch you doing this?

694
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:27,852
Grant catch me?

695
00:33:27,951 --> 00:33:29,153
Grant knew.

696
00:33:29,253 --> 00:33:30,721
You give grant a cut?

697
00:33:30,821 --> 00:33:32,356
30%.

698
00:33:32,455 --> 00:33:33,590
That's a big cut.

699
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:34,792
He knew he had me.

700
00:33:34,892 --> 00:33:36,193
This is the only place in town

701
00:33:36,293 --> 00:33:37,962
where you can dance
with the dead.

702
00:33:38,061 --> 00:33:39,196
Who else knew?

703
00:33:39,296 --> 00:33:42,566
Santos.
Quo.

704
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:43,784
They all knew?

705
00:33:45,452 --> 00:33:47,171
Are there any rules anymore?

706
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:48,572
No smoking.

707
00:33:48,672 --> 00:33:50,574
That was the rule...
no smoking.

708
00:33:50,674 --> 00:33:52,143
That woman, quo,
was real strict about it.

709
00:33:52,242 --> 00:33:53,878
You know, didn't
want a fire, i guess.

710
00:33:53,977 --> 00:33:56,046
But candles were okay?

711
00:33:56,146 --> 00:33:57,248
Huh.

712
00:33:57,347 --> 00:33:59,683
Yeah, they were.

713
00:33:59,783 --> 00:34:02,253
Debbie quo, always eating.

714
00:34:02,352 --> 00:34:04,838
Debbie quo
doesn't allow smoking.

715
00:34:09,643 --> 00:34:12,263
Prenatal vitamins
charged on your credit card.

716
00:34:12,362 --> 00:34:13,847
How far along?

717
00:34:15,616 --> 00:34:16,716
Four months.

718
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:19,452
The father, it's grant?

719
00:34:21,289 --> 00:34:22,239
Debbie, don't you think
this is something

720
00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:23,623
you should've told us about?

721
00:34:25,392 --> 00:34:27,311
I wanted to, i just couldn't.

722
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:28,645
Why couldn't you?

723
00:34:28,745 --> 00:34:31,381
I'd lose my health insurance.

724
00:34:31,481 --> 00:34:33,184
If it got out in the office
that i'd had an affair,

725
00:34:33,283 --> 00:34:35,635
they'd fire me,
it'd go on my record...

726
00:34:37,038 --> 00:34:38,388
no one would hire me
in the system.

727
00:34:38,488 --> 00:34:39,589
I need my insurance.

728
00:34:39,689 --> 00:34:42,909
We need my insurance.

729
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:47,631
Jonah would want me
to have it now.

730
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:51,017
Debbie, you told us he liked
the dead more than the living.

731
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,672
Until he met me.

732
00:34:55,772 --> 00:34:58,491
He loved death until he met me.

733
00:34:59,894 --> 00:35:03,113
I guess he was
just in bad relationships.

734
00:35:03,213 --> 00:35:05,031
Until he met you.

735
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,220
The first time
jonah and i kissed,

736
00:35:09,319 --> 00:35:12,056
he said...

737
00:35:12,155 --> 00:35:15,075
"lips are just a valve,
but yours are sweet."

738
00:35:17,078 --> 00:35:20,497
Jonah thought my valve
was sweet.

739
00:35:20,597 --> 00:35:22,967
You took money
for those parties.

740
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:24,969
To pay for equipment.

741
00:35:25,068 --> 00:35:26,370
And from the photographer.

742
00:35:26,469 --> 00:35:28,138
You ever think
about opening up a gift shop?

743
00:35:28,238 --> 00:35:29,522
We have a gift shop...

744
00:35:30,892 --> 00:35:32,709
we never took any money
from the photographer.

745
00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:34,044
Kathy white was paying
for photos

746
00:35:34,144 --> 00:35:36,462
that grant took for her.

747
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:41,501
We never took any money
from a photographer.

748
00:35:44,105 --> 00:35:45,155
What was grant
doing with the money

749
00:35:45,255 --> 00:35:46,423
that photographer gave him?

750
00:35:46,523 --> 00:35:48,425
According to quo,
he wasn't sharing it.

751
00:35:48,525 --> 00:35:49,760
But there's nothing
in grant's financials

752
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:51,495
that show him getting
any kind of money at all.

753
00:35:51,594 --> 00:35:52,763
And there was no cash found

754
00:35:52,862 --> 00:35:54,731
when his house and car
were searched, so.

755
00:35:54,831 --> 00:35:56,733
Maybe we're looking
at the wrong financials.

756
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:58,002
Maybe we should be looking

757
00:35:58,101 --> 00:35:59,370
at the photographer's
financials.

758
00:35:59,469 --> 00:36:02,622
You mean the ones she told us
not to bother looking at?

759
00:36:16,804 --> 00:36:18,838
Just a valve.

760
00:36:20,874 --> 00:36:22,426
Lips.

761
00:36:22,525 --> 00:36:23,843
He said hers were sweet.

762
00:36:26,147 --> 00:36:27,280
Kathy white's financials.

763
00:36:37,325 --> 00:36:38,409
Nothing.

764
00:36:38,508 --> 00:36:39,843
There's no evidence here
that kathy white

765
00:36:39,943 --> 00:36:41,545
gave any money to grant at all.

766
00:36:41,644 --> 00:36:43,147
So if she
wasn't paying him...

767
00:36:43,246 --> 00:36:44,982
why was he taking
those photos?

768
00:36:45,082 --> 00:36:46,683
There's something else.

769
00:36:46,783 --> 00:36:48,552
Kathy white has two apartments
in that building.

770
00:36:48,651 --> 00:36:50,754
One that we
talked to her in, 314,

771
00:36:50,854 --> 00:36:51,889
and another one.

772
00:36:51,988 --> 00:36:53,290
319.

773
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,907
Must be right down the hall.

774
00:36:56,877 --> 00:36:58,395
Got the pass key
from the manager.

775
00:36:58,495 --> 00:36:59,696
Did he say
why she has two apartments?

776
00:36:59,796 --> 00:37:02,449
Said she used it for storage.

777
00:37:27,341 --> 00:37:29,242
Shunts.

778
00:37:30,978 --> 00:37:34,147
A device used to introduce
or extract fluids from the body.

779
00:37:42,156 --> 00:37:43,756
Five quarts.

780
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:47,511
Quo said grant
was in bad relationships.

781
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,313
I guess this is one of them.

782
00:37:49,413 --> 00:37:51,982
He loved death
until he met quo.

783
00:37:52,082 --> 00:37:54,501
Kathy white loves death, too.

784
00:37:58,972 --> 00:38:01,058
I thought
you could make life.

785
00:38:01,158 --> 00:38:02,208
You can't make life.

786
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:05,045
You can't.

787
00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:09,882
You can't make life.

788
00:38:20,949 --> 00:38:22,783
grant didn't want
to have a baby with you?

789
00:38:28,823 --> 00:38:30,691
He didn't want to be
with anyone until he met her.

790
00:38:34,296 --> 00:38:35,847
But he still took that
chef picture for you, kathy.

791
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:37,048
Didn't he?

792
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,617
He said it was his last.

793
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:39,984
He said we were over.

794
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:41,636
He said he was making
a life with that other woman.

795
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,358
So i took him.

796
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:47,675
All five quarts.

797
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,714
Detective...

798
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,150
take my picture.

799
00:39:43,231 --> 00:39:45,049
She was right next to me.

800
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:48,953
What she said about someone
close to me was gonna die,

801
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,105
she was standing right
next to me.

802
00:39:54,576 --> 00:39:55,827
You all right?

803
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:59,112
I was in that 97%.

804
00:40:03,352 --> 00:40:05,853
I never fired my gun,
except on the range.

805
00:40:20,101 --> 00:40:23,303
Objects are not deceiving.
They are deception.

806
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,460
What we see...

807
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,061
what we hear...

808
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,831
all that our senses
present to us

809
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,582
is a fiction.

810
00:40:36,418 --> 00:40:38,051
No more real...

811
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,488
than a dream.

812
00:40:44,058 --> 00:40:48,095
You can only know...
that which we believe.

813
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:55,320
That which we believe.

814
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:59,056
That is all we have.

815
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:00,674
You ready?

816
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:05,430
You ready?

817
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,998
Yeah.

818
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,065
But not for this.

819
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:10,268
Uh, i don't understand.

820
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:11,969
I go back to my partner.

821
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:14,321
I go back working for the lapd.

822
00:41:16,124 --> 00:41:17,375
Not for you.

823
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,043
I thought
you wanted the truth.

824
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,012
I know that.

825
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:23,697
I understand.

826
00:41:26,935 --> 00:41:28,702
Good for you.

827
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,590
You know...

828
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,126
there is an operation
we're running right now

829
00:41:35,225 --> 00:41:37,778
down in san diego...
border stuff.

830
00:41:39,514 --> 00:41:42,133
You want in?

831
00:41:42,232 --> 00:41:43,301
Yeah.

832
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,586
Okay, yeah.

833
00:41:55,964 --> 00:41:57,649
They'll take you down
to the san diego field office,

834
00:41:57,748 --> 00:41:58,899
get you set up.

835
00:42:02,704 --> 00:42:03,938
You boys out of san diego?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
