1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:00,960
previously on life...

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,720
oh,god,I can'T.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,790
It's my husband's car.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,510
I was jack reese's
confidential informant.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,530
Worked for him too.

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,740
I killed that family,but
I didn't set you up.

7
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,080
Does everyone have a secret?

8
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,020
You want to know mine?

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,400
The one about my father having something
to do with you going to prison for 12 years?

10
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,830
- Reese-- - did I
say I wanted to know?

11
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,180
I know crews has my file.

12
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,590
I need you to tell me what else he has.

13
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,480
Why would I do that?

14
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,190
You don't,I violate your parole.

15
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,740
don't talk to ted anymore.

16
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,200
You make him nervous for some reason.

17
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,240
the business of miracles

18
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,500
thank you

19
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,480
- He's-- -
frozen solid.

20
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,270
He's frozen solid.

21
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,400
What's with the mask?

22
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,840
Dr. Auerbach worked long hours.

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,630
He was known to use oxygen
to stay mentally alert.

24
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,460
You are?

25
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,110
James brenford.

26
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,310
Brenford.

27
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,840
Like the name on the lab.

28
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,960
Like the name on the company.

29
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,190
And a small town in
oregon,but that was gramps.

30
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,820
He used oxygen to stay alert?

31
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,570
It's not uncommon.

32
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,930
Oxygen known to do this to a man?

33
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,820
No,someone switched the tanks.

34
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,300
When auerbach put on that mask,he
was inhaling pure liquid nitrogen.

35
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,180
Maybe it preserved him.

36
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,560
Maybe they can bring him back.

37
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,720
Maybe he can tell us what he saw.

38
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,890
Lno2 comes out of that
tank at 77.2 degrees kelvin.

39
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,990
That 320 degrees below zero fahrenheit.

40
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,840
Wherever he's gone,sadly,he's
not coming back from.

41
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,810
You seem to know a lot about this.

42
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,130
I do own a pharmaceutical
research company.

43
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,530
Any idea who'd want to switch
out Dr. Auerbach's tank?

44
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,740
I imagine the same people that
vandalized my lab,detective.

45
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,400
Ban animal torture.

46
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,480
The animal rights group.

47
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,550
We had trouble with them
before,but never anything like this.

48
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,410
What was Dr. Auerbach working on?

49
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,140
Cancer drugs.

50
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,730
That's what we do here at brenford labs.

51
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,480
We're in the business of miracles.

52
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,350
I saw that commercial.

53
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,970
The moth on the cotton ball.

54
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,870
It's a butterfly on a cloud.

55
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,550
Oh,okay.

56
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,210
Now I get it.

57
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,340
Frozen solid.

58
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,200
Do you have to touch everything?

62
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,120
You found the body?

63
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,050
Yes.

64
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,190
I saw him,and I screamed.

65
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,470
He was,uh,so very frozen.

66
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,710
Like a popsicle.

67
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,720
Yes,he was so very frozen.

68
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,280
Is it true you,uh,broke the doctor?

69
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,270
I hardly touched him.

70
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,290
I just,you know...

71
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,330
what did you do after you screamed?

72
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,980
I called for the security people.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,290
Okay.

74
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,750
You have keys to the lab.

75
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,680
To all the labs.

76
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,090
I have to wait until the scientists
are done working before I can clean.

77
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:48,840
Hard work.

78
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,740
Yeah. A lot of times they eat and
sleep in their labs like animals.

79
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,230
And where were you last night?

80
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,290
Uh,all those pieces of the
doctor,do I have to clean that up?

81
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,800
No,we'll do that.

82
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,650
How about the rats?

83
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,970
I'm afraid the rats are all yours.

84
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,180
Did auerbach usually work late?

85
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,180
Dr. Auerbach was a machine.

86
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,090
He was finishing a clinical
research study on a new cancer drug.

87
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,310
Finish with the study,we
get fda approval.

88
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,680
We go to market.

89
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,400
People get better.

90
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,350
We make money.

91
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,210
You look very healthy.

92
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,740
Do you mind if I ask what you're taking?

93
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,490
Medications,either over
the counter or prescription.

94
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,130
I'm not taking anything.

95
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,350
Really?

96
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,650
Nothing?

97
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,540
For diet,sleep,mood?

98
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,310
Attention span,restless leg?

99
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,410
No.

100
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,030
Come on,some doxepin?

101
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,200
No trazodone?

102
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,540
No alprazolam?

103
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,490
No venlafaxine hydrochloride?

104
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,170
I don't really like drugs.

105
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,250
What's this notation here in
Dr. Auerbach's file from 2002?

106
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,830
A sexual harassment beef
against him filed by a debra lee.

107
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,750
She was?

108
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:04,850
Debra lee was his first assistant.

109
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,780
None of us knew until it
ended,and it ended badly.

110
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,100
She sabotaged his work.

111
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,370
She destroyed records.

112
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,830
Screaming in the hallways,crying.

113
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,070
It was an unpleasant time.

114
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,220
And what happened to debra lee?

115
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,990
I had planned to pay her
to stop crying and go away,

116
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,650
but she went away
before I could do that.

117
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,380
So it all worked out then.

118
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,670
And where were you last night?

119
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,970
At a card game until dawn.

120
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,370
With the deputy mayor,if
you need an alibi.

121
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,740
No pharmaceuticals at all?

122
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,060
And you with such a high stress job.

123
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,190
I wouldn't mind getting
a sample of your blood.

124
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,050
If you don't like needles,I'd be
happy to get a hold of your urine.

125
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,290
Mr. Brenford,can you just tell me
who auerbach's current assistant is?

126
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,230
He was a genius,a hero.

127
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,830
He spent his life trying to cure cancer.

128
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,960
Apparently,the animal rights
people didn't like him much.

129
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,730
Those people care more
about animals than humans.

130
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,180
They sent Dr. Auerbach
hate mail,death threats.

131
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,900
Can you imagine threatening
someone like him?

132
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,560
You have copies of those threats?

133
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,880
They're here somewhere.

134
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,790
Well,whoever killed him
switched those tanks.

135
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,150
That something you know how to do?

136
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,060
Of course.

137
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,900
Anyone with any lab experience
and a label machine could do it.

138
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,500
Where were you last night?

139
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,880
I was home.

140
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,350
We'd been working nonstop for days.

141
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,230
I had to change clothes.

142
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,690
Nonstop for days?

143
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,840
You sleep here?

144
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,200
Not every night.

145
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,440
Auerbach sleep here too?

146
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,260
Did we sleep here together?

147
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,240
Look,I know about his
last research assistant.

148
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,840
Dr. Auerbach and I had a
professional relationship.

149
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,490
He worked hard.

150
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,100
He expected me to as well.

151
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:46,470
Well,now that Dr. Auerbach is
dead,I guess this study's all yours.

152
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,620
I don't know that I want it.

153
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,810
Let me have it.

154
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,480
Let me have it right now.

155
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,050
You will give me that remote.

156
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,200
Fine,keep it.

157
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,770
I should send you back
where we found you.

158
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,260
You remember where that electrode was?

159
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,260
Front door was open.

160
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,440
It doesn't have a lock.

161
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,200
Noticed that.

162
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,440
Betsy doesn't believe in locks.

163
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,260
Who's betsy?

164
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,700
Who are you?

165
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,680
We're the police.

166
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,160
Who's betsy?

167
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,500
Are you just allowed to walk in?

168
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,670
Door was open. Didn't have a lock.

169
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,480
Who's betsy?

170
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,650
This time answer the question.

171
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,570
Whoa,she's an aggressive female.

172
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,340
We need to talk to
you about your monkey.

173
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,220
Do you have a permit for it?

174
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,070
Bamba is a rescue monkey.

175
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,450
Her soul is her permit,just
as your souls are your permits.

176
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,770
Well,we have these badges too.

177
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,940
You're betsy.

178
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,790
Betsy bournes.

179
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,880
I run this chapter
of ban animal torture.

180
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,030
They want to take bamba away.

181
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,470
They're police detectives,billy.

182
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,780
They're not here about bamba.

183
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,480
Are you?

184
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,270
No,we're not here about bamba.

185
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,500
Where here investigating a murder.

186
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,670
A researcher at brenford labs.

187
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,280
Good.

188
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,420
That place is a death camp.

189
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,630
Billy,be quiet.

190
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,270
Dr. Auerbach was killed in his lab.

191
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,440
The evil one is dead?

192
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,110
Take that back. He was a living soul.

193
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,640
You take that back right now.

194
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,970
Okay,I-- I
take it back.

195
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,670
You're here because of our
communications with brenford labs?

196
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,830
You mean the death threats?

197
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,280
We never sent any death threats.

198
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:09,720
Uh,"Dr. Auerbach,"for what you did to
god's creatures "we find you guilty. "

199
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,130
You will be punished.

200
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,600
Animals are people too.

201
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,650
" By "punished" you mean?

202
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,180
Nothing by our hand.

203
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,220
He punished himself by his own actions.

204
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,860
He diminished himself by what
he did to those poor animals.

205
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:24,150
If you love animals so much,why
are you wearing leather shoes?

206
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,070
They're jim shoes.

207
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,410
They're made of jim,our founder.

208
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:34,190
When he died,he willed his body for industrial
use as a way to raise people's consciousness about

209
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,320
what it means to butcher
animals for food and clothing.

210
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,040
We educate people.

211
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,300
We don't kill them.

212
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,990
The lab had your slogan on the wall.

213
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,570
That'd be pretty stupid of us.

214
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,690
Why wouldn't we just sign our names?

215
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,700
I don't know,why didn't you?

216
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,830
Billy,stop talking.

217
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,050
Free speech isn't a crime.

218
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,490
Yeah,but it turns out murder is.

219
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,040
Where were the both of you last night?

220
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,840
Jim also made sure we knew when to
stop talking without a lawyer present.

221
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,500
And that's where we are now.

222
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,790
You're welcome to stay,but billy
and i have to go clean the cages.

223
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,470
They're wearing people.

224
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,340
Just dead people.

225
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,890
It's the texas chainsaw massacre.

226
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,500
It's enough for a warrant.

227
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,020
Well,for a search
maybe,not for an arrest.

228
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,400
Does it seem weird to you that they'd
leave their slogans on the wall?

229
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,820
They put dead people on their feet.

230
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,940
Putting slogans on the wall seems
pretty normal compared to that.

231
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,510
You broke the murder victim.

232
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,830
I hardly touched him.

233
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,110
Forensics had to bag
each piece separately.

234
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,730
You may want to send them
a bottle of something.

235
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,140
It would be a nice gesture.

236
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,850
They did,however,find this.

237
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,760
What's that?

238
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,980
It's a piece of paper taken from auerbach's
pocket,fragmented after crews broke him.

239
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,640
You like puzzles?

240
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,190
What are you doing?

241
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,880
You have to feel your way through this.

242
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,190
Let the pieces speak to you.

243
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,030
You don't feel your way through it.

244
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,900
- You start with the corners.
- Start with the corners.

245
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,440
Who do you like?

246
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,430
For the killing.

247
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,760
Oh,uh,well,the research assistant.

248
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,990
She had the means.

249
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,800
And the animal rights
group had the motivation.

250
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,690
Married?

251
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,390
The dead guy,was he married?

252
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,740
No.

253
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,770
Then the assistant is your killer.

254
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,580
Human nature.

255
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,000
Men and women working
together always end up banging.

256
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,300
And most people are killed
by the person they're banging.

257
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,270
Well,that's just not true.

258
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,490
Yeah,it is. It's a fact.

259
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,170
Come on,crews,back me up on this.

260
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,400
Well,you two work together.

261
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,160
When you have sex,who's gonna kill who?

262
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,450
If I have sex with him,you're
gonna kill me immediately.

263
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,360
She's an aggressive female.

264
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,600
So that one goes there.

265
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,180
This one here.

266
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,470
And we're done.

267
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,300
"I hate you."

268
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,140
We have to stop.

269
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,010
"But I can't stop. I
never want to stop."

270
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,530
Is that a love letter or hate mail?

271
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,590
Love and hate,both four-letter words.

272
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,300
It's dated last week and initialed.

273
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,650
By the assistant jill
abraham,am I right?

274
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,790
Nope,it's initialed "D."

275
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,180
Auerbach's first assistant.

276
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,670
The one he had the affair with.

277
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,970
Her name was debra lee. "D."

278
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,440
So what's "d" up to these days?

279
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,660
We can't find her.

280
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,540
Went off the map when
she left brenford labs.

281
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,940
no phone bills. No driver's license.

282
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,270
No bank accounts. No
traffic tickets. No nothing.

283
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,930
So why does a woman who dropped
off the planet seven years ago

284
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:22,040
write auerbach love/hate mail last week?

285
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,300
Is he doing her?

286
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,920
What?

287
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,820
What?

288
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,540
I went to see kyle hollis.

289
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,240
You should stop doing that,charlie.

290
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,960
You should let the D.A.'S
office take care of it,okay?

291
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,140
You caught the killer.

292
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,460
Yeah,I caught the killer,but
not the guys who set me up.

293
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,880
Let it be over,charlie.

294
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,820
It's not over.

295
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,650
Those same people are still out there.

296
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,200
So you're gonna make them pay?

297
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,010
Hollis said he never
even heard of jack reese.

298
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:09,180
Hollis said he killed those
people,my friends,on his own.

299
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,850
He gave a statement to that,charlie.

300
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,750
I'm not sure I understand why he would
even say anything about jack reese.

301
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,260
Connie,you heard hollis confess
that he was working for jack reese.

302
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,650
Connie,you and me are the only two people who heard
hollis confess that he was working for jack reese.

303
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,260
I heard hollis confess,charlie.

304
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,290
And he signed a statement to that.

305
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,220
But I never heard him say
he was working for reese.

306
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,310
I never heard him
mention jack reese at all.

307
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,880
Thanks for coming,jack.

308
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,250
Always a pleasure to see you.

309
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,150
You feeling okay?

310
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,530
You seem a little under the weather.

311
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,640
What do you want?

312
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,510
They,jack.

313
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,930
They want to see the girl.

314
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,350
that's not the arrangement.

315
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,730
You don't have her anymore,jack.

316
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,330
The arrangement is it's better for
everybody if only I know where she is.

317
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,660
Well,everybody wants to
change the arrangement.

318
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,690
Everybody wants to take a
look at the seybolt girl.

319
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,600
That's not gonna happen.

320
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,090
You think if we have the
girl,then we don't need you,jack?

321
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,360
I have the girl.

322
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,400
As long as I do,we have crews.

323
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,420
That's what counts.

324
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,220
Why are you lying,jack?

325
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,480
they want to see the girl.

326
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,250
Oh,they want me to tell you,jack.

327
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:33,610
You go back a long way,but
not for nothing,there was six.

328
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,340
There is five.

329
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,450
There could just as easily be four.

330
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,070
No,no.

331
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,330
No! No! No!

332
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,040
No! No!

333
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,390
Fear.

334
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,690
Who are you afraid of,jack?

335
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,940
That one of your zen tapes?

336
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,580
Yeah,something like that.

337
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,710
We still on for tomorrow?

338
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,400
Tomorrow?

339
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:07,600
Yeah,I have the-- the interview with
the dean from the business school.

340
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,810
You forgot,didn't you?

341
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,990
No.

342
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,850
It's for a teaching position.

343
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,080
And I need to be there because...

344
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:20,290
because you are my reference,charlie.

345
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,390
You are my reference.

346
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,740
My partner thinks you're
good for the auerbach thing.

347
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,200
Thing?

348
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,550
Is that cop talk for "killing"?

349
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,090
Yeah,that's cop talk.

350
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,470
Because you'd rather not say the word?

351
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,650
I can say the word if you want me to.

352
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,130
My partner thinks you killed him.

353
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,810
And what do you think?

354
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,240
I think it made you sad to hear
that auerbach had been killed.

355
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:10,310
People do what you do because of what
they've seen or what they've done.

356
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,430
Which one are you?

357
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,610
What did you do,betsy?

358
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,930
Debra lee.

359
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,630
The hate mail to the lab,the
love note to auerbach.

360
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,520
Both written by the same person.

361
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,350
Both written by you.

362
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,050
you married charlie crews' ex-wife.

363
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,970
That's right.

364
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,410
And now that detective crews is out
of jail,has your life changed at all?

365
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,480
Well,I certainly get pulled
over a lot more than I used to.

366
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,680
What do you want,crews?

367
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,380
Hmm,you wanna arrest me,then do it.

368
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,250
You wanna shoot me,then
get it over with.

369
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,430
Okay.

370
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,590
Here it goes.

371
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,050
I'd like your permission
to sleep with jennifer.

372
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,070
You want to sleep with my wife?

373
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,540
No,I want to sleep with my wife.

374
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,340
Ex-wife.

375
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,480
It's complicated,mark.

376
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,320
Can I call you mark,mark?

377
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,620
Mark?

378
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,690
It's okay,you don't have
to give me an answer now.

379
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,380
Think about it.

380
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,410
Get back to me.

381
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,650
Is that from where the monkey hit you?

382
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,760
Someone hit you after the monkey?

383
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,250
Do I want to know?

384
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,680
Glad we could have this talk.

385
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,910
Why'd you change your name?

386
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,810
Because I didn't like who I was.

387
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,020
are you someone else now?

388
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,530
I'm a better person now.

389
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,070
Just for the record,did auerbach get
it on with betsy bournes or debra lee?

390
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,040
I'm not sure that we
have to sit here for this.

391
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,280
I'm not sure we care,counselor.

392
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,760
Your client withheld information pertinent
to an ongoing murder investigation.

393
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,720
So just sit down.

394
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,030
You loved him and you hated him?

395
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,120
I'd like that note back,please.

396
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,990
That note is evidence.

397
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,970
I left that lab because
of what he did in his work.

398
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,110
But I couldn't leave him because of what
he did to me,what we did to each other.

399
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,090
And for the record,I let him
call me anything he wanted to.

400
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,280
You like being betsy bournes?

401
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,980
Yes,very much.

402
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:46,470
It's who I'm supposed to be.

403
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,590
Do you understand?

404
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,160
I do.

405
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,140
If the people of ban animal torture
found out about you and auerbach°™

406
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,170
they would have asked me to leave.

407
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,040
Is that why you killed him?

408
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,620
My client admits to the sex.

409
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,270
But that,as far as I
know,is not a crime.

410
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,700
So now I'm getting up.

411
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,930
And so is my client.

412
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,440
If betsy/debra were still
having sex with auerbach,

413
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,430
I know two people that might
not be so happy about it.

414
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,980
Well,let's go talk to 'em.

415
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,780
But I get the assistant,and
you get monkey boy.

416
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,510
Betsy,debra.

417
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,460
If you have sex with a woman
with two names does that°™

418
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,690
no,it doesn't count as a threesie.

419
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,550
well,I see you got your remote back.

420
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,240
But I have to watch her shows.

421
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,820
You going somewhere?

422
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,360
I don't believe that.

423
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,050
but it's true.

424
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,770
They never stopped.

425
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:44,710
All those years,all those
protests,they kept at it.

426
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,800
just like a couple of rabbits.

427
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,160
It doesn't bother you that she was
doing that with the man you hated?

428
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,900
She lied.

429
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,410
People lie.

430
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,360
Anyway,I'm outta here as soon as she
gets back to take care of the animals.

431
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,180
Do you mind?

432
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,050
They're bamba'S.

433
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,050
Ask her.

434
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,660
I don't do this for the money.

435
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,920
We don't get any of it.

436
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,010
My little brother died of cancer.

437
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,920
After watching that,really,what
else could I do?

438
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,660
Why work with auerbach?

439
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,120
For auerbach.

440
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,630
Because he was the best.

441
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,870
No one else came close.

442
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,560
I joined a club to impress a girl once.

443
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,810
Man,was I ever young.

444
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,810
I joined ban animal torture because I
believe in the cause,not to impress betsy.

445
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:38,680
Debra.

446
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,540
I can't even remember the cause.

447
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,200
I remember the girl.

448
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,280
I ended up marrying her.

449
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,740
Aren't you supposed to
be looking for a killer?

450
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,340
That's what I'm doing.

451
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,660
Excuse me for saying this,jill,but
the way you talk about auerbach,

452
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,900
it kinda sounds like you loved him.

453
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,970
Me in love with auerbach is impossible.

454
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,040
Because you are?

455
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,410
A woman who values her own worth.

456
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,960
He may have been a genius,but he
was also an egotistical,selfish jerk.

457
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,250
Some women go for that.

458
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,570
Devoted assistant types,especially.

459
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,370
Yeah,I've heard that,detective.

460
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,370
But I don'T.

461
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,710
He was cruel to me.

462
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:18,330
He was cruel to almost everyone
he came into contact with.

463
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:24,350
Was he cruel to anyone in particular?

464
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,790
Are you married?

465
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,470
Her mate died in auerbach's lab.

466
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:37,770
And still betsy bournes was having
sex with auerbach,with that killer.

467
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,650
Animals are people,but I guess
some people are animals too,right?

468
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,180
Yeah.

469
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,860
Bustamante,the janitor,auerbach
just loved to pick on him.

470
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,740
Auerbach was having a bad day,work wasn't
going well,bustamante caught the heat.

471
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,260
You didn't mention this before because?

472
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,520
I didn't think of it.

473
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,810
Bustamante's around all the
time,but you never see him,you know?

474
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:02,240
You said anyone who works in the
lab could have switched those tanks?

475
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,590
Crews.

476
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,350
Ladies.

477
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,640
I didn't let it bother me.

478
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,600
I needed the work.

479
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,680
Besides,a guy like you,if you wanted to,

480
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,860
you could take care of
him anytime you want,right?

481
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,390
And if I did,I woulda used my hands.

482
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,280
Not those hoses.

483
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,710
The way he used his hands on you?

484
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,490
We heard you broke a beaker,and
he threw his lab book at you.

485
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,870
Slapped you if the lab
wasn't clean enough.

486
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,800
Look,he got what he deserved.

487
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,740
I don't feel bad about it.

488
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,180
But?

489
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,290
But I saw something.

490
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,430
What kind of something?

491
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,700
Someone,that night,comi o outf his lab.

492
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,190
I didn't want to say nothing before
because I didn't want to get involved.

493
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,270
I saw a woman.

494
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,400
Do you know this woman?

495
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,520
Maybe.

496
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,260
I try not to pay too close attention.

497
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,830
Let's see if we can figure out
a way for you to see her again.

498
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,130
We tape people going
into the building,not out.

499
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,440
Standard flow control theory.

500
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,260
You think about my offer?

501
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,580
What offer?

502
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,870
You're just being selfish.

503
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,230
I mean,what am i asking for really?

504
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,800
Ushing it down the toilet anyway.

505
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,100
There,there,that's her.

506
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,670
***

507
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,280
Can you zoom in there?

508
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,350
Anything for you,detective.

509
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,130
holy hannah. That's debra lee.

510
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,470
well,according to the time stamp,she
entered well before the murder.

511
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,420
Come in with a crowd,less
chance of being noticed.

512
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,570
When did you see her leave?

513
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,790
A little after midnight.

514
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,020
Just after the killing.

515
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,660
billy,you have to understand.

516
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,010
This has nothing to do with you.

517
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,540
So what,I'm just like a monkey to you?

518
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,420
Just like bamba?

519
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,710
Maybe I should live in a cage.

520
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:43,440
Is that what you'd like,for
me to live in a cage?

521
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,710
Door. Unlocked.

522
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,690
Debra lee,you are under arrest
for the murder of dan auerbach.

523
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,060
Billy,tell them I was with you.

524
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:53,240
We have video of you entering
the lab on the day of the murder.

525
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,530
I was there earlier that day.

526
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,510
To do what?

527
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:58,880
You know what.

528
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,730
Billy,don't be a child.
Tell them I was with you.

529
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,450
Who have a witness who puts you in
the lab when auerbach was killed.

530
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,160
Well,whoever is saying that is a liar.

531
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,680
you're the liar. Whore!

532
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,890
Whore?

533
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:17,110
So I guess it did bother you that
she and auerbach were-- whore?

534
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,130
You tried to be a man about
it when I was last here.

535
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,500
You did a good job.

536
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,540
But you're hurt,kiddo.

537
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:32,770
So go ahead and call her
all the names you want.

538
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,480
But then you tell us what you know.

539
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,860
billy.Tell them.

540
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:44,860
The same hands that tortured
animals touched your body.

541
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,490
Like you wanted to touch her?

542
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,870
Okay,yes!

543
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,650
Like I wanted to,but never...

544
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,660
billy. I'm so sorry.

545
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,290
No,you're not! Don't say that!

546
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,850
All right,enough. We're
taking her away now.

547
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,490
They're gonna put her in a cage.

548
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,380
She'll get a number,and they'll treat
her like an animal like she deserves.

549
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,940
You will never have to see her again.

550
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,920
Stop.

551
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,370
We were at a prayer vigil.

552
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,930
I shot video of her.

553
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,420
I always shot video of her.

554
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,800
Any reason why you didn't
just tell us all this before?

555
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,670
Jim told us to d obeythe police.

556
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,050
Jim. The guy in your shoes?

557
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:37,480
I'm leaving. Bamba's coming with me.

558
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:40,210
Maybe in a while you
can see her,but not now.

559
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,620
I guess I was too nice to the animals.

560
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,960
That's why you couldn't love me.

561
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,900
does your daughter ever
talk about detective crews?

562
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,120
No. Why would she?

563
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,810
Because they're partners.

564
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,550
We don't talk about
the job in the house.

565
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,420
Not now,not ever.

566
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,200
Still,you must be very proud of
her following in your footsteps.

567
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,340
Hey,fellas.

568
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,280
Any of you see who killed auerbach?

569
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:51,740
I know nobody likes a rat,but seeing
as you guys are already rats...

570
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,120
you look like a rat I knew inside.

571
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:59,020
Have you got family up in pelican bay?

572
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,020
Detective crews.

573
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,260
Your alibi checked out.

574
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,210
We've moved off you as a suspect.

575
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,500
"Moved off." Is that cop talk?

576
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,460
Detective crews,why are you here?

577
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,620
Dad.

578
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,000
Did you really send an
innocent man to prison?

579
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,290
Get outta my house.

580
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:04,840
You'd need a pretty big dose
of this to do any real damage.

581
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:07,020
- You just inhaled it?
- Yeah.

582
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:13,090
You may experience psychic
disturbances,hallucinations.

583
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,640
Anything like that yet?

584
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,110
Nope,nothing.

585
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,350
Maybe you should drive me home.

586
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:47,050
No! No! No!

587
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,580
No! No! No!

588
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,250
This is a really nice car.

589
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,660
It's italian. From italy.

590
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:57,730
I've never been to italy. You been
to italy? Would you like to go?

591
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,010
They have souls there. Italian souls.

592
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,470
Extremely tasty souls.

593
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,290
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

594
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,010
I'm sorry your lover's dead.

595
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,990
Me too.

596
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,220
I wish she'd stop doing that.

597
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,930
Detective reese?

598
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,890
Is that you?

599
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:46,630
Hey,ted. This is betsy bournes.
She lives with a monkey.

600
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:53,000
Charlie,this is hal orton,dean
of the business school.

601
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,320
Get your hair caught in the car door?

602
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,670
Yeah,that's right.

603
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,550
I tried that already.

604
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,470
Of course you did.

605
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,320
Oh,I can see your keys right
there on the front seat.

606
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,180
Of course you can. Do you have a knife?

607
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,070
- No. Why?
- So I can cut my hair.

608
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,160
One time,I got something caught in
a car door,but it was not my hair.

609
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,300
Did you cut it off?

610
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,690
No,but I did use these.

611
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:24,650
So,Mr. Crews,ted here handles
your considerable settlement?

612
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,630
Why would you want to know that?

613
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,890
well,it's a business school,charlie.

614
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:35,840
My business,since I got out,has
been growing your wealth.

615
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:39,180
- Ted and I were in jail.
- He knows that.

616
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,480
For a very long time.

617
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,320
I've been thinking,we should have
learned to play the harmonica,ted.

618
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:48,790
- maybe I should come back.
- That's what I've been thinking.

619
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,620
Maybe you should come back.

620
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,530
I really am sorry your lover is dead.

621
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,950
I'm really sorry too.

622
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,030
And I'm the sorriest of all.

623
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,990
***

624
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,850
Oh,sorry.

625
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:20,630
Listen,detective,when I was
heading home in my car right now,

626
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,710
I couldn't help but overhear
you saying-- no,screaming°™

627
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,430
"no. No. No. No." You
were pounding your wheel.

628
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,940
I'm a punch-the-roof
guy myself.

629
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:33,550
And I know you think
I'm a bit of a clown.

630
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,870
But if you ever really want to
talk,I've been through some stuff.

631
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,000
I got it. I got it. I got it. See?

632
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,590
Thank you.

633
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,060
Anybody else think this is weird?

634
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,720
Crews.

635
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:20,160
if the protest video puts betsy in
oxnard at the time of the killing,

636
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:23,030
then why did bustamante say he
saw her in the lab that night?

637
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,400
Yeah.

638
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:28,370
You,um,you don't just see
women who aren't there.

639
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,820
He was lying,crews.

640
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,740
Why would he lie?

641
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,680
Let's find out.

642
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,720
He was lying because he was stealing.

643
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,330
A janitor.

644
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:10,000
Around all the time,but
you never really see him.

645
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:12,810
Well,we see him now.

646
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,860
who is this?

647
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,480
industrial espionage.

648
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,450
Bustamante gives her the pills.

649
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,960
And she gives him the money.

650
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,770
I can see him tuesday,then?

651
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,600
you mind if i take a look in there?

652
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,650
Cash?

653
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,810
This is?

654
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:03,100
My...our son.

655
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,300
You're his wife?

656
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:08,660
Ex. I'm his ex-wife.

657
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,970
You'll see him tuesday? Your son?

658
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,230
That's right. My son.

659
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,280
Got your divorce papers here.

660
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,890
You didn't mention you and your
wife were split when she alibied you.

661
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,090
That's right. I didn'T.

662
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,720
hardly divorced,looks like.

663
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,050
Got no custody. It looks like.

664
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,100
That's right. She got everything.

665
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,900
When did your son get sick?

666
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,800
- Two years ago.
- Rare form of cancer.

667
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,430
You know when you,with uh...

668
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,050
access to these pills.

669
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,900
The pills were working.

670
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:57,620
So what went wrong,abel?

671
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,920
He caught me stealing them.

672
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,220
He?

673
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,570
Auerbach.

674
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,030
Then what did you do?

675
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,500
He wouldn't give the pills to me.

676
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:09,130
To my son.

677
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:17,280
I killed him.

678
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:23,570
Auerbach wouldn't give me
the pills,so I killed him.

679
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,220
What is it you were flushing down
the toilet,that branford wants?

680
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,040
He wants my urine. Or my blood.

681
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,560
He thinks I'm healthy.
He wants to study it.

682
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,020
No,that's not what he wants.

683
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:42,520
No? What does he want?

684
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,570
He wants to study you.

685
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,080
That's what I just said.

686
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,260
No,reese. He wants you.

687
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,890
And his play is asking
me for fluid samples?

688
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,350
Well,he's a scientist.

689
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,510
They're all scientists.

690
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,260
We may have solved a murder,reese,but
we have not solved the murders.

691
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,700
Murders?

692
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,430
Why these rats,reese?

693
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,040
The rats with the blue and yellow tags.

694
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,250
Are still alive.

695
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,270
The rats with the red tags,are dead.

696
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,020
Why these rats,reese?

697
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,970
I'll tell you why these rats.

698
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,680
These rats are from the control group.

699
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,380
Which means they are
not chosen at random.

700
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,710
Why would you only kill
rats in a control group?

701
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,270
You kill these rats to cover up the
fact that the drug wasn't working.

702
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,410
Okay,but bustamante says
it was working on his kid.

703
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,730
That child has a rare form of cancer.

704
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:43,490
If branford wants to cash in on the
drug,it'll have to work much wider than that.

705
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,910
Who would want to cover that up?

706
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,060
Why these rats,abel?

707
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,460
I already told you. They're just rats.

708
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,430
no,they're not just rats.

709
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,530
They were living souls,and
they died for a reason.

710
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:00,010
Who told you to kill these rats?

711
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,170
No one told me anything.

712
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,590
- Who killed auerbach?
- I did.

713
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,340
But not with your hands,like a man?

714
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,040
You're going to jail,abel.

715
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,100
That's okay.

716
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,170
See,that's the part
that makes me curious.

717
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,410
Why is it okay?

718
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,000
you covering up for someone,abel?

719
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:17,830
You take the fall,while someone gives
your son those pills,when your in jail?

720
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,460
What do you want from me?

721
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,380
You're a smart guy,abel.
You know you're going away.

722
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:26,620
If it were me,and I were
going,I'd keep a little protection.

723
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,180
A little something to make
sure all those pills don't stop.

724
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,320
That'd be the smart thing.

725
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,600
so how do you make sure your son keeps
getting those pills when you're in jail?

726
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,100
we're shutting down the lab,abel.

727
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:38,800
There are no pills for anyone now.

728
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,660
You're going to jail for nothing.

729
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,960
No more pills?

730
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,850
You have to take me to the lab.

731
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,090
This was going to save your son?

732
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:23,070
Start with the corners.

733
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:25,360
You're joking. They're all corners.

734
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,100
thank you for coming by,ms. Abraham.

735
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,310
What is she doing here?

736
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,140
jill abraham,this is betsy bournes.

737
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,570
- I know who she is.
- And I know who you are.

738
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,840
In fact,I used to be you.

739
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,040
Yeah? Who are you now?

740
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,720
ladies,please. We have
a small science problem.

741
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:50,260
Since both of you are scientists,we
thought maybe you could give us some help.

742
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:54,070
As you know,abel bustamante has been
arrested for the murder of Dr. Auerbach.

743
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,040
Now,we found this on him.

744
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,130
We think it's from the lab.

745
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,130
We know it's evidence.

746
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,380
See those little squiggles there?

747
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:02,450
That's science stuff,right?

748
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,480
You're going to put this
back together by hand?

749
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,490
We've had some practice.

750
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,730
The variations in the pieces
are too minute to do it by hand.

751
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:10,860
that's what I told them.

752
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,300
You'll need a laser measure.

753
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:13,710
I could take it back to my lab.

754
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,210
I have the right equipment there.

755
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,620
That's a great idea. Why don't you?

756
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,530
It's the lunch menu.

757
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,920
That there. It's the lunch menu.

758
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:29,130
you were right. We
couldn't do it by hand.

759
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,740
It was uh,all corners.

760
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,870
you know,ms. Abraham,you're a scientist.

761
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,740
So maybe you can help us out here.

762
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,690
that's science,right?

763
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,960
Yeah. Um,but i don't recognize it.

764
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,150
are you sure?

765
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,620
Because betsy thinks
she knows what it is.

766
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,670
And since she used to be you,we
thought you might know what it is.

767
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,190
it's a calculation.

768
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,980
Figuring how much liquid nitrogen
it would take to kill a man

769
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,570
who is 71 inches tall,and
weighs 183 pounds.

770
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,700
and that's about Dr. Auerbach's size.

771
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,800
my guess?

772
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:04,020
We find his medical file,that's
exactly auerbach's size.

773
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:07,250
My guess? That handwriting
there,it's yours,jill.

774
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,610
you kill auerbach.

775
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:12,860
You set up betsy first,and when she alibis
out,you had bustamante there to take the fall.

776
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,460
A back-up plan. That's good.

777
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:17,700
Dr. Auerbach was calling off the study
because the drug wouldn't work wide enough.

778
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,320
There was no money in it.

779
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:23,700
that's why she killed those rats!
To make it look like it was working.

780
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,150
Kimbo gets it,now.

781
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:29,410
And,F.Y.I.,I had the sexy
assistant pegged from the get-go.

782
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:30,990
Auerbach was a thief!

783
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,160
He stole seven years of
my life. And then,what?

784
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,380
The study's no good?
The drug is no good?

785
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:36,730
And you're no good?

786
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,770
you knew he used oxygen to stay alert.

787
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,790
You switched those tanks.

788
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,870
- You killed auerbach.
- He was throwing me away!

789
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,520
He was still auerbach. And
all I was,was a failed study.

790
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,150
My career was over.

791
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,710
No one was calling
off that study. No one.

792
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,190
You used to be me?

793
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,240
Well,you can be me again. Because
I don't want to be me anymore.

794
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,140
Auerbach's lab is evidence.

795
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,150
All those pills are evidence.

796
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,110
Sometimes evidence gets misplaced.

797
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,520
Misplaced?

798
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:47,660
So I just want to say,thank you so
much for giving ted another chance.

799
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,940
Well,ted explained what happened,so...

800
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,980
yes,you know how in your line of work
sometimes you'll find yourself in a lab,

801
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,930
and you,you knock something over.

802
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:59,020
And you inhale something that you
shouldn't,and the next thing you know°™

803
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:01,860
well,it's over and done
with. Let's move on. Okay?

804
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:06,060
Now... perhaps you
can tell me,Mr. Crews,

805
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:10,290
the way in which Mr. Earley has
diversified your holdings,huh?

806
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:15,400
Oh,excuse me for one moment.
Ted,go ahead and start.

807
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,030
Hey,jenn--

808
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,280
You asked my husband
permission to have sex with me?

809
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:25,720
It was the honest thing to do.

810
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,200
It was the stupid thing to do.

811
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,640
When things like that happen,you
pretend it didn't,and you go on.

812
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:35,410
You don't talk about it with the husband of the
woman you want to have sex with in the back of a car.

813
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,360
Do we want to pretend it never happened?

814
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,030
That would be the civilized thing to do.

815
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,800
Do we want to be civilized?

816
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,320
You guys see that? She was
here,right? You saw her hit me?

817
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:00,580
