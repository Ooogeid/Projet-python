1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,700
I appreciate
you coming...i do.

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,200
Oh, when the mayor's office calls,
We really don't have a choice.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,100
I didn't know who else to call.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,200
Why do you think something's
happened to your wife?

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,600
- We came back to--
- I have that 8:00 conference call.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,000
- It'll have to wait.
- It's new york,they won't be happy.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,100
Okay, okay. 15 minutes.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,300
My wife is not here.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,300
Her car is, but she is not.
She is not at her office.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,100
So if she is not here,
and she is not there,

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,400
Where is she?

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,600
You were out of town last night?

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,400
Vegas, had to see a client
last minute.We all got back just now.

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,300
- We all?
- My staff and i.

15
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,800
- Can you take a look at this?
- Not now.

16
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,400
But it has to go out now.

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,900
All right. Excuse me.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,200
Howard amis.

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,600
The howard amis. Biggest
political consultant in l.A.

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,500
You remember the crying tomato ad?

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,300
Don't remember it.

22
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,300
- "somebody's gotta pick me."
- No. Don't remember it.

23
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,500
Let's go see his lair.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,400
in these times of uncertainty,

25
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,600
Family...it's who we are.

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,700
No, not "who we are."

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,300
It needs to be "who you are"--
Talk to the voter."

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,200
Family...

29
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,700
Where is she?

30
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
I was just going
to surprise my wife.

31
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,900
Surprise her how?

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,300
She thought i was coming back tonight,
I just--Just wanted to surprise her.

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,700
Mr. Amis, is it possible
your wife is with a friend?

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,300
I called all her friends.

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,100
Mr. Amis, is it possible
your wife is with a friend You don't know

36
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,100
be--Because
she thought you weren't here?

37
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,500
Friend i don't know.
No, that is not possible.

38
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,700
- Have you called the hospitals?
- Yes.

39
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,000
You try her phone?

40
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,100
 Rings, then it goes to voicemail.

41
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,900
Something has happened to lisa.

42
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,900
I know that i'm supposed to
wait 24 hours, But i couldn't.

43
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,600
So i called in some favors,
i'm sorry.

44
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,400
Is there anyone you can think of
Who would want to harm your wife?

45
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,300
She's a california state assemblywoman,

46
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,300
I'd say all the people
that voted against her,

47
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,600
And half the people that voted for her.

48
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,100
- her car is here?
- Yes.

49
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,800
- Bed?
- Slept in.

50
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,000
Where's your cat?

51
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,100
Luther? I don't know.

52
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,900
I...i haven't seen it.
But i wasn't looking for it.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
- Her cat or yours?
- Hers.

54
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,300
D...Do you think
that lisa has left me?

55
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,400
I think her bed
has been slept in.

56
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,300
I think her car is here.

57
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,900
Luther.

58
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,700
Will you call
your wife's phone for me?

59
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,100
Why?

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Stay here.

61
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,700
What is it?

62
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,100
Just stay
right there please, mr. Amis.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,400
It's latched from the outside.

64
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,800
It's who you are...

65
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,300
What?

66
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,800
What is it?

67
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,100

70
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,700
Bullet wounds, i count four.

71
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,800
If the jets in the spa were on,She would
have never have heard anyone approach.

72
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,400
If the shooter puts
his muzzle in the water--

73
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,300
No one hears the shot.

74
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,700
She goes down,
killer latches the lid.

75
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,100
Comes over the fence.
Leaves the same way.

76
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,200
You could do the whole thing in under
a minute If you really wanted to.

77
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,100
Yeah,if you really wanted to.

78
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,900
Who are all these people?

79
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,600
They work with us.

80
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,900
They're here to help
find who killed your wife.

81
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,000
What are they looking for?

82
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,100
Evidence.
May they look around?

83
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,900
Yeah, of course...i...

84
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,800
But?

85
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm the husband,
my wife has been killed.

86
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,100
Everyone's going
to think i did it.

87
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,300
Everyone's going to think
i killed my wife. I would.

88
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,800
My people, they want me
to go out to the curb,

89
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,200
And cry in front of the cameras.

90
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,300
Your staff was
with you in vegas?

91
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,400
They were there at the tables
til about 1:00...

92
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,200
Caught the morning flight.
I just wanted to surprise her.

93
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,000
Mr. Amis...

94
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,300
Is there anything missing
from your house?

95
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,200
No. I mean, i don't think so.

96
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,100
Why? What does that look mean?

97
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,400
This wasn't a home invasion.

98
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,300
What are you saying to me?

99
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,000
We're saying that someone
came here to kill your wife.

100
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,300
Can you think who that might be?

101
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,700
Yes, i can.

102
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Initiative 38.

103
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,900
Initiative 38 is a
comprehensive ban on handguns.

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,800
Lisa was working
to get it passed.

105
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,900
How comprehensive?
We were taking back our streets.

106
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,600
You get any push back
from the gun companies?

107
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,600
- Any push back?
- Yeah.

108
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,300
There was a lot of money coming in
against us from the other side,

109
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,300
From p & k guns.

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,800
I didn't think
they'd do this though.

111
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,400
- Lisa was the face of initiative 38.
- Well, there's no proof they did.

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,500
Look, it would be a big help If i
could put out that p & k are suspects.

113
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
- A big help to what?
- To the initiative.

114
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,400
We're investigating
a homicide.

115
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,200
And lisa was trying
to stop hundreds of homicides.

116
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,600
So can i release
that p & k are suspects?

117
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,500
No, you cannot release that.

118
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,000
What about "persons of interest?"

119
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,000
No, you can't release that either.

120
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,800
Is it what lisa would've done?

121
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,800
Yes. Use everything.
Leave nothing.

122
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,600
How long did you work for lisa?

123
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,600
She hired me six years ago.

124
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,100
Right out of princeton.

125
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,400
Your first job?

126
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,700
- Your dream job?
- Yes.

127
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,400
- You married to it?
- Yes, i am.

128
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,900
What about lisa's marriage?

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,300
I didn't get it.

130
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,000
Howard was right,
lisa was left.

131
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,500
He stood for everything
she wanted to tear down.

132
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,000
But she said she loved him.

133
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,900
Where were you last night?

134
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,700
Working here.

135
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm on the security tapes
if you need it.

136
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,500
Lisa worked you hard?

137
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,900
Like she worked herself.
She was...

138
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,000
- A killer?
- Yeah.

139
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,800
She was a killer.

140
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,900
But she didn't own a gun.
or a gun company.

141
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,400
You want to be mayor?

142
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,700
 Well, i'd considered it
as part of a long-Term plan,

143
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,600
- But how did you know that--
- I'm sorry...I was talking to him.

144
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,800
Do i want to be mayor?

145
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,600
When you first got
out of jail, got all that press,

146
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,200
I told lisa i could
make you mayor in three weeks.

147
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,400
Wow. Mayor, huh?

148
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,400
You want to run,
give me a call.

149
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,200
Is it what lisa would've done?

150
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,600
Use everything. Leave nothing.

151
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,500
Hey,You've reached dani reese,

152
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,300

00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,400

Okay?

157
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,400
- What?
- Nothing.

158
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,600
Because she said
i could be mayor?

159
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,200
No, the door was just locked.

160
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,700
You--You are a sore loser.

161
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,700
- No, i'm not.
- Oh, yeah. You are.

162
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,400
- On the rare occasion you do lose.
- To be clear, i am not a sore loser.

163
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,300
And she said she could make you mayor,
Not make you a good mayor.

164
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,700
Elder brothers?

165
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,500
Four of them.

166
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,500
- It shows?
- A little bit.

167
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,400
- Hey, would you vote for me?
- No.I would not vote for you.

168
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,200
I said i'd vote for you.

169
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,300

00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,200
If she was for it,
he's against it.

175
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,400
So they had
nothing in common.

176
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,300
Well, maybe what they had in common
Is if they had nothing in common.

177
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Do not write that down.

178
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Might be a clue,i'm going to
write it down, You may look away.

179
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,100
You sure howard was in vegas
When his wife got dead in that hot tub?

180
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,800
Well, there are some time gaps,

181
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:51,700
But we've got him on casino video, hotel
door swipes,and airport check-In.

182
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,500
Wife dies,
money's on the husband.

183
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,200
That's what her husband said.

184
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,500
Lisa amis is
the face of initiative 38.

185
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,500
If that passes,
p & k guns gets hit hard.

186
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,100
Then you're going
to want to know this...

187
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,500
The ballistics on the bullets
that killed ms. Lisa amis:

188
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,000
Four bullets,Two from a
nine millimeter, two from a.22.

189
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,300
- Two guns.
- Two shooters.

190
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,000
Someone really wanted her dead.

191
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,100
We should go.

192
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,800
Something different about you.

193
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,200
No, i'm exactly the same.

194
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,400
- There's something.
- She's not smiling.

195
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,200
I'm smiling.

196
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,600
I am smiling.

197
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,100
Because i could be mayor.

198
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,500
- You're going to be mayor?
- No, but i could be.

199
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,900
In three weeks.

200
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,200
We should go.
And i am smiling.

201
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,500
Hey...

202
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,300
- What do you hear from reese?
- Not a whole lot.

203
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Phone goes to voicemail
the last few days.

204
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,400
Did she tell you what she's doing
over there with those feds?

205
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,200
Organized crime task force.

206
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,100
Why are you asking me
these questions?

207
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,900
Is there something i should know
about dani--Detective reese?

208
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,400
Captain, what would you say
If i asked you to gps track her cell?

209
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,100
I'd say she was
in the care of the FBI

210
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,000
Why would i track her cell?

211
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,200
P & k firearms, shots fired.

212
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,900
Bobby, who are they?

213
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,400
They work here.

214
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,700
And they're all carrying?

215
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,600
Within the confines of the building,
They are well within their rights.

216
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,000
- Lawyer and a cop.
- That all?

217
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,000
Olympics, just the relay.

218
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,400
- Who's she?
- Whitney paxman, ceo of p & k guns.

219
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,300
She was carrying a nice sized.45.

220
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,100
Empty holster. Was she the one
who discharged her weapon?

221
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,400
Yes ma'am.
So we took it away from her.

222
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,600
- Discharged it at...?
- At her.

223
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,600
- I had something to give her.
- Something being a body bag.

224
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,700
She should know
the end result of her product.

225
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,600
She should see what it leads to.
Where lisa ended up.

226
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,600
Ran by security with it, Was making
a dash to the corner office.

227
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,900
And she shot at me.

228
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,300
- It was a warning shot.
- I felt it go by my ear.

229
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,900
That's why we call it
a warning.

230
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,600
- Chairman of the company...
- And a pretty good shot.

231
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,500
 Lock up ella holden,

232
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,300
And give ms. Paxman there
her gun back.

233
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,700
Well within her rights.

234
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,300
No, there is no case number
attached to this gps request.

235
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,200
I know you have to put
something down on the form.

236
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,700
Put down "captain's discretion."

237
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,200
Yes, i know that's not a number.

238
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,500
Well, i know
i need a number now.

239
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,700
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

240
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,600
Oh, a number!

241
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Like a case number.
Yes, i have a case number.

242
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,700
Of course
i have a case number.

243
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,200
It is 9-8-7-4-9-8-1-7-4.

244
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,200
Thank you.

245
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,500
What the hell do you want?

246
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,600
My file, sir.

247
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,100
Can you get my shoe?

248
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,700
- Ms. Paxman...
- Plum. Please call me plum.

249
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,200
Plum as in the plum, plum?

250
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,800
- Plum, like the fruit plum?
- Yes, that's what my friends call me.

251
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,200
What? He eats a lot of fruit.

252
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,100
We have some questions
about your business, ms. Paxman.

253
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,800
I run a family business.

254
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,200
That made $25 million
in sales last year.

255
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,100
What happens to that business
if initial 38 passes?

256
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,400
We both know that's never
going to happen.

257
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,700
Lisa amis thought it might.And
lisa amis seemed like a smart woman.

258
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,900
Lisa amis was a very smart woman.

259
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:50,900
You knew her?

260
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,800
Yes, before she got into
politics,I tried to hire her.

261
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,700
See, i like smart women.

262
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,400
I like smart women
working for me.

263
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,300
But sadly, she worked
for the other side.

264
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,300
Why'd you think initiative 38
will never pass?

265
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
The polling numbers are
in our favor four to one.

266
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,900
People like your guns that much?

267
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,200
People like our jobs
that much, detective.

268
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,200
P & k firearms produces
one of the last products

269
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,400
This country actually makes
cheaper and better than china.

270
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,100
We're going to crush
that initiative.And everyone knows it.

271
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,500
Ms. Paxman,
you should see this.

272
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,300
P & k are persons of interest
in the killing of lisa amis.

273
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,000
- how do you know that?
- The police are here right now...

274
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,300
Questioning the owner.

275
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,800
Was a p & k firearm used
in the shooting?

276
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,600
Does this have anything
to do with initiative 38?

277
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,800
Is this personal
because she was your boss?

278
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Use everything. Leave nothing.

279
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,400
If you become mayor, what's
your stand on gun control?

280
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
It's complicated.

281
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,300
There are way too many shootings.

282
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,400
But the second amendment of the
constitution does guarantee certain rights.

283
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,700
You been rehearsing that speech?

284
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,400
- It shows?
- Just a little bit.

285
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,100
And that is a lot of fire
power just to push a mail cart.

286
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,500
Detective crews?

287
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,500
That is a lot of fire power.

288
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,400
You're not talking
about the mail cart.

289
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,400
No, i'm talking about sending
two shooters to kill lisa amis.

290
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,500
Why would you send two shooters
to kill a 40-Year-Old unarmed woman?

291
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,300
That is a lot of fire power.

292
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,600
- He sent two shooters--
- To kill two people.

293
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,300
Howard amis went
to vegas last minute,

294
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,600
He was supposed to be
in that house with lisa.

295
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,100
He sent two shooters
to kill two people.

296
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,700
Help me. Please.

297
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,500
Mr. Amis?

298
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,700
Mr. Amis?

299
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,900
 Help me. Please.
Help me.

300
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,000
If...I move,the clock is off.

301
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,100
The bomb squad's almost here, howard.

302
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,500
It was on the doorstep.
I think it's flowers for lisa.

303
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,600
I open it up, and there's a clock
in here, And it starts ticking.

304
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,100
I grabbed the wires,
the clock stopped.

305
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:31,100
But now, every time i move,
the clock starts ticking again.

306
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,700
So i'm not going
to move anymore, okay?

307
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,800
What's the note say, howard?

308
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,900
"Who is the little one now?"

309
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,700
The bomb squad's almost here, howard.

310
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,500
Okay?

311
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,200
Family...

312
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,400
Look at me, howard.

313
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,400
Where's all your staff?

314
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,200
Gone.

315
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,200
For the day?

316
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,300
No, i let them go.
My clients, too.

317
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,900
Look at me, howard.

318
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,100
Why'd you let them all go?

319
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,600
What my wife did--

320
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,000
She believed in it.

321
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,900
What i do--

322
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,800
I just do it to do it.

323
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,300
But now--Now that she's dead...

324
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,200
You don't
want to do it anymore?

325
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,700
I don't think
i can stand much longer.

326
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,600
Like, a shark, you know...
i got to keep moving.

327
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,100
- Okay!
- Grab the wires!

328
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,000
Okay, grabbing the wires.

329
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,000
Okay.

330
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,500
How you doing?

331
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,300
Pretty good,
how about yourself?

332
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,800
I'm holding a bomb.

333
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,100
i saw that.

334
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,100
Bomb squad's here.

335
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,200
Okay, why don't
you point them on in here.

336
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,200
"Who is the little one now?"

337
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,300
It seems like i should know
what that means, But i don't.

338
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,300
I don't.

339
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,200
Too bad no one got a picture
of you saving me.

340
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,000
You could make a whole career
on a picture like that.

341
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,300
We could stage it again,
if you want.

342
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,900
You ever get any threats before?

343
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
In public. To my face.

344
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,200
It's the business.

345
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,100
But not like this.

346
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,100
We need to see your client list.

347
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,900
Oh, yes, i--

348
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,200
I don't think it's there.

349
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,100
It seems like i should know
what that means.

350
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,900
But i don't.

351
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,900
Howard...

352
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,300
Just 'cause you don't want
to do what you've been doing,

353
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,700
Doesn't mean you can't
do something else.

354
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,700
You know?

355
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,800
Yeah, don't worry.

356
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,800
I'm a shark.

357
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,500
Gotta keep moving.

358
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,200
We're going to leave
some uniformed officers here.

359
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,700
No prints on the device
left at amis' house.

360
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,000
- Crude, but clean.
- No prints on the note, either.

361
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,500
Looks like seever took almost
getting blown up personally.

362
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,200
Looks like seever did.

363
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,600
- Nothing personal,i'd vote for her.
- Nothing personal,so would i.

364
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,700
I requisitioned them.

365
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,100
You just have to know what forms to
fill out And who to submit it to.

366
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,700
 His life, her life.

367
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,600
His calendar, her calendar.

368
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,600
His enemies, her enemies.

369
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,900
His causes, her causes.
His money, her money.

370
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,600
- Connections?
- None.

371
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,600
Really? No connections?

372
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,000
No connections that would kill one
And put a bomb in the other's hand.

373
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,300
So i searched every database of
every hate group that has ever existed,

374
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,100
For that phrase,
"who's the little one now?"

375
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,000
And came up with nothing.

376
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,300
It's personal.

377
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,800
"Who's the little one now," is
what you say to someone's face.

378
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,100
It could be personal.
But howard can't remember.

379
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,200
You know, holding a live bomb
causes a very strong reaction,And...

380
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,300
lisa's dead.

381
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,400
 Well, let's go talk to someone
who knew lisa As well as lisa knew lisa.

382
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,400
You hand deliver
any body bags lately?

383
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,000
Get off with a slap on the wrist?

384
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,000
What can i do for you?

385
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,100
Who is the little one, ella?

386
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,800
You think she killed lisa?

387
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,700
No, she was a she
until you said she was a she.

388
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,500
- So, who is she?
- Lisa's sister, jackie.

389
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,800
When they were little,they called
each other Big one and little one.

390
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,700
Lisa was the big one, And...

391
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
Jackie was the little one.

392
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,900
Oh, my god! I had totally
forgotten about that.

393
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,200
Lisa always took care of her.

394
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
Took care of her?

395
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,800
They stopped talking
to each other a year ago.

396
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,400
Lisa refused to speak of it.

397
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,100
I just assumed lisa
was tired of caretaking.

398
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,700
Big one and little one.

399
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,500
That's what that meant.

400
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,700
- Jackie...
- Was trouble.

401
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,000
Bad drugs.
Bad men.

402
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,400
You didn't mention this
before, because?

403
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,400
Why would she kill lisa? She's...

404
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,000
Just little one.

405
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,200
And where's jackie right now?

406
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,400
Where she's
been for the last year.

407
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,000
And where would that be?

408
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,700
Just...way the hell out there.

409
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,200
Why exactly do
the park rangers carry guns?

410
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,500
Bears?

411
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,400
Jackie, we want to talk
to you about your sister.

412
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,500
Because you killed her.

413
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Jackie, we're the police.
Why would we kill her?

414
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,600
You killed her and
now you've come here to kill me.

415
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,800
- Who told you that?
- The voice.

416
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,200
- What voice is that, jackie?
- The voice on my radio.

417
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,400
Jackie, we don't want
to hurt you.

418
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,800
We want to take care of you.

419
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,300
Yeah, why should
i believe you?

420
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,000
Because...

421
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,400
You're little one.

422
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,300
What did you call me?

423
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,900
Little one.

424
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,900
I'll write up the report,
We wait for jackie to be brought up.

425
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,800
I want to write it up.

426
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,100
No, i like writing reports.

427
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,000
The GPS trace on reese's
phone came back negative.

428
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,000
So maybe her phone's just off.
So i called the fbi.

429
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,400
- What did the fbi say?
- They said they'd get back to me.

430
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,200
- Did they get back to you?
- No, they did not.

431
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,300
So now you are going to tell me
what the hell's going on.

432
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,900
This have something to do
With your off-The-Book investigations?

433
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,300
I will not have
that stuff on my floor.

434
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,200
I will not allow it
to jeopardize dani--

435
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,700
My detectives.

436
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,500
I just want to know why reese
is not answering her phone.

437
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,700
The tech guy told me

438
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,500
If her phone is off, but the
battery's in, they can track it.

439
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,300
But lapd doesn't have the equipment.

440
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,200
I might know someone who does.

441
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,400
Where--Where you going? Captain?

442
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,600
I do not need gps to find out
where my detectives are.

443
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,100
- Hey, where are you going?
- Where he's going.

444
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,500
And where's that?

445
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,900
I'll know when i get there.

446
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,500
- And what should i do?
- You should be here.

447
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,900
I am here.

448
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,100
Okay. Then...there you are.

449
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,900
What are you?

450
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,200
The bad-Ass agent that doesn't talk?

451
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,000
No.

452
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,800
No...because
you said something?

453
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,300
Yep.

454
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,500
What can i do for you today?

455
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,900
You can start by telling me
where my detective is.

456
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,800
Detective reese is
in the field.

457
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,100
Which field would that be?

458
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,400
On an operation.
Out of contact.

459
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,600
She said she was
coming back to the force.

460
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,200
She changed her mind.

461
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,100
Well, i'd like to speak with her.

462
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,900
That is not possible
right now.

463
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,100
I need you
to make it possible.

464
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,500
You need me to?

465
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,700
Because of your professional or personal
relationship with detective reese?

466
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,900
 Boys, just because you have guns
Doesn't mean you have to show them.

467
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,600
When detective reese checks in,
I will let her know you were here.

468
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,900
Been in these rooms before, huh?

469
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,100
Drugs, larceny...

470
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
Tell me about that voice, jackie.

471
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,100
It's not that kind of voice.
It's not like a voice in my head.

472
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,500
Someone came on the radio,

473
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,700
Said that the people that killed
my sister Were coming to kill me.

474
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,800
I'm not crazy.

475
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,900
- Did you recognize the voice?
- No, i didn't.

476
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,900
- Anybody else hear it?
- No, they didn't.

477
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,800
You've been alone for a while.

478
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,000
I heard it. I did.

479
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,300
Out there for a while.

480
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,200
What happened
to send you out there?

481
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,400
There's something else in your file
We need you to look at.

482
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,100
Do you know what this is?

483
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,700
It's an f.I. Card, that's what cops
call it. It's a field interview card.

484
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,400
A cop fills it out when
he has contact with a civilian.

485
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,900
This is your f.I. Card.

486
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,700
You were handcuffed.
Sat in the back of a squad car.

487
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,300
Then you were let go.

488
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,400
Then your sister stopped talking to you,
And you went into the woods.

489
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,800
You do something that
your sister got you out of?

490
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,000
You're going talk to the cop, jackie,
You might as well tell us.

491
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,600
I was waiting for a bus,
I was talking to some guy,

492
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,000
And i got picked up
for solicitation.

493
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,200
You tell lisa
and they let you go?

494
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,000
Yeah.

495
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,400
But i didn't do it.

496
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,300
I was clean.And even when
i wasn't, i would never do that.

497
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,500
I was waiting for a bus.

498
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,000
- You tell that to lisa?
- Yeah.

499
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,600
She believe you?

500
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,600
No, she...

501
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,000
She was angry.

502
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,000
What did she do?

503
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,900
She called up my boyfriend,
and she told him i was...

504
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,900
She said i was...

505
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,000
A whore.

506
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,600
Do you know
how to shoot, jackie?

507
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,600
You know i do.

508
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,400
What about explosives?

509
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,900
We use them at the park.

510
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,300
You want a lawyer?

511
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,900
Lisa usually did that for me.

512
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,300
Charlie crews wants to hire me?

513
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,200
Yes.

514
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,600
- To find someone?
- Yes.

515
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,100
Correct me if i'm mistaken,
but he's an lapd detective.

516
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,100
Why doesn't he perform
this task himself?

517
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,900
Charlie says that
you have better...equipment.

518
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,700
Who does he wish me
to locate?

519
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,500
You file this f.I. Card?

520
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,700
Yeah, solicitation beef.

521
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,100
How'd you come by it?

522
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,400
Anonymous tip, phone call,
Which told me who her sister was.

523
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,900
I made the call, cut her loose.

524
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,200
That's how we do--
I ain't in trouble?

525
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,500
No, you're not in trouble.

526
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,300
And she didn't seem like a hooker.

527
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,500
Anonymous tip, And a representative's
sister gets busted for hooking.

528
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,700
Anonymous tip. Somebody was trying
to smear lisa amis?

529
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,500
Who'd benefit from that?

530
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,600
There is going
to be sexual tension.

531
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,600
Between us.

532
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,400
Between all
male-Female partners.

533
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,200
It's in the documentation.

534
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It suggests fantasy...

535
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,400
As a way of dealing with it.

536
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,800
I'm sorry, what did you say?
I was thinking about something else.

537
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,800
Detectives.

538
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,300
What can i do for you?

539
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,300
Why would you smear lisa amis?

540
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,600
Why would i smear lisa amis?

541
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,500
You were ahead four to one.

542
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,500
- Why would you kill lisa amis?
- Why would i kill lisa amis?

543
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,900
- You were ahead four to one.
- Detective, is everything okay?

544
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,700
Seever, can i ask you
a question?

545
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,600
What are we doing in this room?

546
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,400
Um, we're going
to question whitney paxman.

547
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,100
Any why are you saying that?

548
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,500
We have a doctor here,
Would you like me to call him for you?

549
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,200
Why are we here?

550
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,500
Family.
The two you are.

551
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,200
I saw that video
in howard amis' office,

552
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,200
I started thinking about family.

553
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,500
I see the note, little one.

554
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,300
We find out about the sister,
we go to the sister.

555
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,200
She takes a shot at us.

556
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,400
Why did those things happen?

557
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,500
Who called us to the house?

558
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,900
Told us everyone would suspect him?

559
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,200
Who was standing there with
that bomb Making himself a victim?

560
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,100
He ran a campaign on us.

561
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,100
Detectives...

562
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,400
It's all over the wires.Howard amis
is making an announcement.

563
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,700
Good afternoon. Thank you so much
for being here.

564
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,200
All my life,
i have believed in nothing.

565
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,300
I just wanted to win.

566
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,200
But my wife, lisa amis,

567
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,400
She believed in what was right.

568
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,000
Died believing in
what was right.

569
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,800
Died for it.

570
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,800
And she showed me
how weak i was.

571
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,600
- Is he about to confess?
- ???

572
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,000
- No, no, he's not.
- I stand for you in the name of my wife,

573
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:32,000
And all those who have given of
themselves for what they believe.

574
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,900
I announce myself as a candidate
For the united states senate.

575
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:46,400
And in the name of my wife,
I pledge my full support for initiative 38.

576
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,200
And i start with these guns.

577
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,000
Guns bought just
an hour ago on the street.

578
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,300
Just like the guns
that killed my wife lisa.

579
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,900
I am starting???these guns.

580
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,600
We will take back our streets.

581
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,400
- We Did you just see that?
- ???

582
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,300
- I see a lot of guns,
but i see two in particular.
- ???

583
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,600
A nine millimeter
and a.22.

584
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,100
Two guns.

585
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,400
Two guns and one shooter.

586
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,400
God bless you.
God bless america.

587
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,000
So you can find anyone?

588
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,600
With a cell phone on or off.
As long as the battery's still in.

589
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,700
Why, mr. Early, is there someone
you wish to be located?

590
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Oh, my daughter.

591
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,700
Yeah, of course.
Anyone else?

592
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,800
No.

593
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,300
She's in italy, mr. Early.

594
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,700
- Who is in italy?
- You know whom, olivia.

595
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,400
- Alone?
- Mm, alone.

596
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,100
She called you twice,
hung up both times.

597
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,500
How do you know this?

598
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,300
I know everything.

599
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,300
What's that like?

600
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,800
Almost always disappointing.

601
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,800
There.

602
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,400
Detective reese's phone.

603
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,800
15 miles away. Shall we?

604
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,500
Uh, maybe we should
call charlie.

605
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,400
Where's your sense
of adventure?

606
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,900
Ah, do you want one?
I have a spare.

607
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,300
 That's not true.

608
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,700
Lisa loved howard,
he loved her.

609
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,400
Everyone knows that.

610
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,700
I know that.

611
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,300
He killed lisa and is
running for senate on her death?

612
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,300
But you arrested jackie.

613
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,100
Because he wanted us to.

614
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,000
Everyone thinks jackie did it.

615
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,100
Because he wanted us to.

616
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,700
But howard was in las vegas.

617
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:10,500
The temperature of the water lisa was in Makes it
impossible to determine an exact time of death.

618
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,500
He could've shot her before he left,
And then called it in.

619
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,600
 When he got back?

620
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,500
Got ahead of the story.

621
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,000
It's how you handle the press.

622
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,600
- And the bomb?
- Sent it to himself.

623
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,000
- Thing that looks like another victim.
- Got way ahead of the story.

624
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,800
What did he do
to those two sisters?

625
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,400
He tore them apart on purpose.

626
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,500
Made jackie the perfect suspect,
And then he killed his wife.

627
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,600
What did we do
to those two sisters?

628
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,800
What do you mean "we," ella?

629
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,200
I know jackie never did that,
did what they said she did.

630
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,900
How did you know that?

631
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,800
I was the one
who called in that tip.

632
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,300
I was here when
the police called the office.

633
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,800
I was the one who said i was lisa,
Asked them to let jackie go.

634
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,500
So you were the one
who called jackie's boyfriend.

635
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,600
I was the one
who called her a whore.

636
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,200
Why would you do that?

637
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,100
Howard said we had to...
To keep lisa away from jackie.

638
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,700
Jackie was going to drag lisa down,

639
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,800
And if lisa was going to be a senator,
We had to keep her away from jackie.

640
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,700
Did howard kill lisa?

641
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,800
Do you want to get him, ella?

642
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,200
Do you want to help us get him?

643
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,600
I need you to go to howard.

644
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,700
Tell him that you found
a tape that lisa made Before she died.

645
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,400
Tell him that she
said she was afraid of howard.

646
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,400
That she thought
he was going to kill her.

647
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,700
That if she was killed,
it was howard who did it.

648
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,600
But that tape doesn't exist.

649
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,900
What difference does it make
if it exists or not?

650
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,500
You just go to howard,
tell him you have that tape,

651
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,500
Then see what he does.

652
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,500
Don't worry.
We'll be there too.

653
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,500
You think ella can do this?

654
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,400
I think ella
was born to do this.

655
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,200
Ella.

656
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,900
What are you doing here?

657
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,900
They want me
to help them get you.

658
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,900
Get me for what?

659
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,800
For killing lisa.

660
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,200
They gave me this tape.

661
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,700
- Who did?
- They did.

662
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,200
They gave me this tape.

663
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,400
- What's on the tape?
- It's blank.

664
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,400
They just want
to see the look on your face.

665
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,800
Oh.

666
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,300
But i have another tape.

667
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,000
Maybe you want to hear that?

668
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,600
Maybe i do.

669
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,400
As your campaign manager,
i think you do.

670
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,800
i need you to go to howard.

671
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,000
Tell him that you
found a tape before lisa died.

672
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,500
Tell him that she said
she was afraid of howard.

673
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,800
That she thought
he was going to kill her.

674
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,500
That if she was killed,
it was howard who did it.

675
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,500
But that tape doesn't exist.

676
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,700
What difference does
it make if it exists or not?

677
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,500
You just go to howard,
tell him about that tape.

678
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,900
This is the problem
with the lapd.

679
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,200
False accusations,
corruption...

680
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,300
My wife fought against this,
and so will i.

681
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,800
In her name...

682
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,100
In her name.

683
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,900
Why don't you go ahead
and play that other tape anyway?

684
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,200
- But it's blank.
- Eh, just go ahead and play it.

685
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,600
my name is lisa amis.

686
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,900
I'm afraid of my husband, howard amis.

687
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,200
I'm afraid he's trying to kill me.

688
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,500
If i'm murdered,
it is howard who did it.

689
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,000
I hope that i'm wrong.

690
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Why would you play that tape?
What could they have promised you?

691
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,300
Howard...

692
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,000
You knew everything that i knew,
You're just as guilty as i am.

693
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,300
Like you said, mr. Amis,

694
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,100
You're her husband.

695
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,500
Everyone will think
you did it.

696
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Well, i know what
howard and ella have in common.

697
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,400
- Jail time?
- Yes, and lots of it.

698
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,700
It was you.
It was your voice.

699
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,000
People always said
i sounded just like lisa.

700
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,600
You were right.
Ella was born to do that.

701
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,300
And, um, i would vote for you.

702
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,900
- Oh, you don't have to say that.
- I know i don't, but i would.

703
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,400
I think you'd make a good mayor.

704
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,400
I wouldn't want to be mayor.

705
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,400
That's why
you'd be such a good one.

706
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,500
Is that zen?

707
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,900
Is it?

708
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,800
- I don't see anything.
- It's here. They're right here.

709
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,200
See，Two sets of tire tracks.

710
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,700
They dragged someone
from one car to the next.

711
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,300
And she was alive and kicking.

712
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,900
Ah.

713
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,900
- Now we need to call charlie.
- Yeah.

714
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,100
Now we need to call him.

715
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,600
Roman.

716
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,900
But he's in maximum security.

717
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,200
Who the hell are you?

718
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,300

00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,200

paid to serve his time.

724
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,100
Roman's not here?

725
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,600
