1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,085
previously on life...

2
00:00:02,185 --> 00:00:04,475
the police report says
she was out of the house.

3
00:00:04,575 --> 00:00:07,570
Rachel seybolt was there
the night of the murders.

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,455
hey,uh,you know mark
rawls,don't ya,arthur?

5
00:00:10,555 --> 00:00:12,200
you told his son you
could get him out of jail,

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,530
Then you broke
his son's heart.

7
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:18,310
What does the bank of los angeles hold up
have to do With the detective who put you away?

8
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,250
They both have
jack reese in common.

9
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,575
He's our suspect now.

10
00:00:21,675 --> 00:00:23,190
What did you say about
the bank of los angeles?

11
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,495
You're stepping
over a line here.

12
00:00:24,595 --> 00:00:26,035
You might wanna step back.

13
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:28,680
son,you keep going where you're
going,And you're gonna find trouble.

14
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,240
And you would do well to
keep my daughter out of it.

15
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,510
kyle hollis,jack
reese's informant?

16
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,610
There's a mug shot here
From his last arrest.

17
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,685
This is the picture rachel drew.

18
00:00:39,785 --> 00:00:41,820
That's the killer.

19
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,370
What are you thinking about?

20
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,420
I'm thinking about
where i'm going next.

21
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,110
"fill it up"

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,930
this is a maximum
security facility

23
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,180
You just can't
stay away,can you?

24
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,755
If i didn't know any better,I'd
say you liked it here.

You two play nice,now.

28
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:04,650
Yeah.

29
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,020

34
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,525
I'll tell you,though...

35
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:26,470
Out in the yard today,Felt
like earthquake weather.

36
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,625
Yeah?

37
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:29,830
Felt that way.

38
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,555
You need something,Mr. Crews?

39
00:02:32,655 --> 00:02:34,110
I do.

40
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,870
I'm not sure what
i can do for you.

41
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,850
I need to find somebody.

42
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,280
Been under for
about 12 years.

43
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,595
None of your police friends
can help you with this?

44
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:47,715
No. No,this guy's
more in your world.

45
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:49,620
My world.
- Prison.

46
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,945
I need to find this guy.

47
00:02:52,045 --> 00:02:56,300
We both know who has the best
information About how to find¡ª

48
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,000
How to find one of us.

49
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:10,500
I guess this will be the
thank-You For what you did.

50
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,470
For getting that
guy that killed my son.

51
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,630
I guess so.

52
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,105
Tell me his name.

53
00:03:19,205 --> 00:03:21,925
I'll reach out and
see what i can touch.

54
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:23,860
Hollis.

55
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,430
Kyle hollis.

56
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,205
And what's Mr. Hollis done That you're
here without your pretty partner?

57
00:03:29,305 --> 00:03:31,725
I have some questions i want to ask him.

58
00:03:31,825 --> 00:03:33,780
Questions.

59
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,980
Okay.

60
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,655
Earthquake weather?

61
00:03:54,755 --> 00:03:56,660
Sure feels that way.

62
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,925
domestic disturbance call.

63
00:04:21,025 --> 00:04:23,025
People heard screaming and yelling.

64
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:26,870
He was banging on the
door,yelling to be let in.

65
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,340
She was yelling
back to take a hike.

66
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,230
Neighbor said
that was usual.

67
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,455
But when the neighbors heard the missus
screaming,"I'll put a bullet in you,"

68
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:39,890
They decided maybe a call
to 911 was a good idea.

69
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,370
We roll up just in time To see the
blast come through the door One shot,

70
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,605
got him right
through the heart.

71
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:48,630
Two hours his dinner sat
on the table,Two hours!

72
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,945
Dinner in the morning?

73
00:04:50,045 --> 00:04:52,580
Apparently,he
worked nights.

74
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,925
if she shot him through the
door,Why is there blood on her hands?

75
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:58,170
It's not blood,it's meat sauce.

76
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,805
Why is there meat
sauce on her hands?

77
00:04:59,905 --> 00:05:01,870
I really don't know.

78
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,980
And where's the gun?

79
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,510
well... We're thinking...

80
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,320
She threw it in there.

84
00:05:25,063 --> 00:05:25,127
{\a6}constance griffiths
ex-attorney for charlie crews

85
00:05:25,162 --> 00:05:29,235
you're aware that most men Who come out of
prison after 12 years Just end up back inside.

86
00:05:29,335 --> 00:05:31,275
Detective crews
isn't most men.

87
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,535
How is he different?

88
00:05:32,635 --> 00:05:34,940
Detective crews is innocent.

89
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,675
When he went in,he was innocent.

90
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:39,050
Did he come out that way?

91
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,035
he comes home o hours late,And
she shoots him through the door.

92
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:45,365
I'm guessing they had other
issues in their marriage.

93
00:05:45,465 --> 00:05:47,320
Apparently so.

94
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,480
we cannot find
the gun in there.

95
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,335
Keep looking.

96
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,275
We're looking,detective.

97
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,575
We came through the door about
two minutes After she popped him.

98
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:57,670
Not a lot of places
she coulda stashed it.

99
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,450
But it is just not there.

100
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,190
You are free to
look for it yourself.

101
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:05,390
Perhaps detectives Have
better eyesight than us grunts.

102
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,535
Is there something maybe
i can help you with?

103
00:06:17,635 --> 00:06:19,900
Someone wants
to talk to ya.

104
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,505
Crews.

105
00:06:25,605 --> 00:06:27,910
how's the world,Mr. Crews?

106
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,115
You tell me.

107
00:06:29,215 --> 00:06:31,095
Found that man
you're looking for.

108
00:06:31,195 --> 00:06:31,935
Where is he?

109
00:06:32,035 --> 00:06:33,095
He's in indio.

110
00:06:33,195 --> 00:06:34,815
He's been there five years.

111
00:06:34,915 --> 00:06:36,950
He's got a daughter,new name.

112
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,735
Reverend orson parker.

113
00:06:38,835 --> 00:06:39,880
Reverend?

114
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,075
Found the lord or
something like that.

115
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:46,320
When i put the word out i was
looking for kyle hollis,It came ck...

116
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,015
A lot of other people
are looking for him.

117
00:06:49,115 --> 00:06:52,680
I guess they all just wanna
ask him some questions too,huh?

118
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,540
I gotta go.

119
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,810
Don't wanna miss
my hour in the yard.

120
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,215
They can't find the gun.

121
00:07:03,315 --> 00:07:04,695
i told her we
couldn't find the gun.

122
00:07:04,795 --> 00:07:06,495
And we can't leave
until they find the gun.

123
00:07:06,595 --> 00:07:08,250
We're doing our
best,detective.

124
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,175
Maybe the plants are making
the boys A little absentminded.

125
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:14,235
I think you have to smoke
it for that to happen.

126
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:17,330
Well,i wouldn't know
about that myself...

127
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,370
Charlie?

128
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,585
I gotta go deal
with something.

129
00:07:22,685 --> 00:07:23,635
Will you cover for me?

130
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,180
You have to go
deal with something?

131
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,575
We've got a dead guy in the hall,Half
an acre of thc in the living room,

132
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:30,950
We can't find the gun,And you
have to go deal with something?

133
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,010
Will you cover for me?

134
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,730

135
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,180
We'll partner on up while you're
gone,Ain't that right,detective?

136
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,585
the buddha was asked
if he ever felt anger.

137
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:52,395
"Of course," said the buddha.

138
00:07:52,495 --> 00:07:56,245
The buddha was asked if he ever
felt the desire To strike another.

139
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:58,240
"Of course," said the buddha.

140
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,105
"But if i am connected to
all things," Said the buddha,

141
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:05,615
"Hurting another is hurting myself.
And how does that better me?"

142
00:08:05,715 --> 00:08:07,740
Because it just does.

143
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,350
Cop kid,huh?

144
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,750
Dad was a cop,you're a cop.

145
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,240
You know,my dad?

146
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,605
Meat packer.

147
00:08:46,705 --> 00:08:50,305
Which,as it turns out,is
not as romantic as it sounds.

148
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:54,355
But you...Daughter
of captain jack reese.

149
00:08:54,455 --> 00:08:56,130
Man!

150
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:02,650

reese's daughter When you want a leg up,huh?

151
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,210
Let's just find the gun,okay?

Focus on the job,huh?

153
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,840
I guess that's how
you become a detective.

154
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,775
Where you going?

155
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,920

00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,085
I kinda wanted to
see him,you know,so...

178
00:11:16,185 --> 00:11:18,920
Could you turn
that back on,please?

179
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,495
Maybe you wanna
open that door.

180
00:11:31,595 --> 00:11:33,095
I wanna ask you
something first.

181
00:11:33,195 --> 00:11:35,860
What you wanna do is
open that door,officer.

182
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,110
Every time we're together,

183
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,305
You got a look as though There's
something you wanna say to me.

184
00:11:42,405 --> 00:11:44,910
I've been known to misread A
woman's intentions on occasion,

185
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,365
So let me just
ask you,detective.

186
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:50,420
Is there something
you wanna say to me?

187
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,715
All right,bobby.

188
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:57,975
What i wanna ask you Is how come
you weren't there for your partner?

189
00:11:58,075 --> 00:12:00,925
They asked you at the trial
About the cuts on his hands.

190
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:02,825
Charlie said he got
cut during an arrest.

191
00:12:02,925 --> 00:12:04,490
And why didn't
you back that up?

192
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,485
Because i didn't see it.

193
00:12:05,585 --> 00:12:07,555
Well,i didn't ask
if you saw it,officer.

194
00:12:07,655 --> 00:12:11,800
I asked why you didn't
back up your partner.

195
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,910
You wanna know why?

196
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:20,870
Because i.A.D. Put me in a
room And they told me that

197
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:28,080
if i lied And backed up
charlie, I'd go to jail too.

198
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:37,370
Wait-- You
hear that?

199
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't hear nothin'.

200
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:53,860
Man... These folks
got a lot of pet mice.

201
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,705
These aren't pets.

202
00:12:55,805 --> 00:12:59,365
This... This is meat.

203
00:12:59,465 --> 00:13:01,110
Meat for wha...

204
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,130
Now,what do you
think was in there?

205
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,220
Want my guess?

206
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,180
A snake.

207
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,290
A big one.

208
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:32,310
I need an ambulance
immediately to 12 west athens.

209
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,595
You coming to
get my daddy?

210
00:13:34,695 --> 00:13:35,865
Why would you say that?

211
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:40,630
The guys who did this,Cut
me,they were looking for him.

212
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,300
I wanna take a
look at this,okay?

213
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,600
You're a policeman?

214
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,400
Am i going to die?

215
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,645
'Cause...That's
my blood,and...

216
00:13:56,745 --> 00:13:58,800
it's... It's supposed to be inside me.

217
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,635
Am i gonna die?

218
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:03,345
Not for a long time.

219
00:14:03,445 --> 00:14:04,525
How do you know that?

220
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,130
I can see.

221
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,745
What can you see?

222
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:11,190
I see you older.

223
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,540
Can you see it?

224
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,745
No.

225
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:17,670
Sure you can.

226
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,200
You can see tomorrow.

227
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,300
You imagine yourself in tomorrow...

228
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,500
And there you are.

229
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,720
You can do that.

230
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,770
Look.

231
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,700
Okay.

232
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,870
Do you know the guys
who did this to you?

233
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,030
They were looking for your father?

234
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,950
Yes.

235
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,090
Did you tell them where he was?

236
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,615
I don't know where he is.

237
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:59,670
He's been gone
since yesterday.

238
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,350
How come you're here?

239
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,570
I didn't call you.

240
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,120
They cut the lines. Why are you here?

241
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,250
Came here to be with you. Hmm?

242
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,680
Be with you while you were
waiting for the ambulance.

243
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,350
So you didn't
have to be alone.

244
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,405
I don't know you,do i?

245
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:32,590
No. You don't know me.

246
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,210
Can i see my daddy?

247
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,055
Can you do that for me?

248
00:15:40,155 --> 00:15:46,340
Can you turn that back on,please?

249
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,685
*****

250
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,135
I made this tape.

251
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:56,055
The fire is now.

252
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:58,310
I made this so...

253
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,960
I could still watch
him when he went away.

254
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,290
we burn every day
we are not right!

255
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,020
Reese.

256
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,390

257
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,495

00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:15,545
It's kyle hollis,detective crews.

259
00:16:15,645 --> 00:16:18,190
I hear you been
looking for me.

260
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,235
The fire is not
some distant image.

261
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:27,280
The fire is now.

262
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,625
I'm in your house,kyle.

263
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:29,970

are you doing there?

264
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,290
I was looking for you.

265
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,145
I wasn't the first person
to get here,you understand?

266
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:36,510
Somebody else got here.

267
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,375
How is she?

268
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:40,235
She's gonna be okay.

269
00:16:40,335 --> 00:16:41,105

They all want me dead.

274
00:16:47,055 --> 00:16:48,200
Why'd you call me?

275
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,145

badge, You can get me out of l.A.

00:17:04,585 --> 00:17:06,575
They're gonna
take care of you.

They'll take care of you.

281
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,085
You're gonna be okay now.

282
00:17:10,185 --> 00:17:11,345
are you hurt anywhere else?

283
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:13,375
Do you have any other pain?

284
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:15,095
Are you allergic
to any medications?

285
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:19,365
Gimme some abdominal dressings Two large
bore ivs,and get some fluids on board.

286
00:17:19,465 --> 00:17:23,365
You called my dad
kyle. On the phone.

287
00:17:23,465 --> 00:17:25,065
That's what the
other men called him.

288
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:29,220
The men who were looking
for him Called my dad kyle.

289
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,710
You wanna kill my dad too?

290
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,835
he's the one.

291
00:17:45,935 --> 00:17:48,400
He's the one that did this to me.

292
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:50,895
He's the one.

293
00:17:50,995 --> 00:17:53,485
He's the one! He's the one
who tried to kill me! He--

294
00:17:53,585 --> 00:17:56,620
Stop. Do not move.

295
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,245
We are looking
for a burmese python.

296
00:18:21,345 --> 00:18:23,215
Its name is cato.

297
00:18:23,315 --> 00:18:24,560
It is a constrictor.

298
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,660
It is not venomous.

299
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,160
Try not to let it wrap itself
Around any of your appendages.

300
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,735
What could a python eat?

301
00:18:32,835 --> 00:18:34,630
What can or what does it eat?

302
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,540
Could it eat a gun?

303
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,325
They don't like anything cold.

304
00:18:37,425 --> 00:18:38,625
Could it eat a warm gun?

305
00:18:38,725 --> 00:18:40,790
They're not fond of metal.

306
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,905
What about a warm gun
Covered in meat sauce?

307
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:47,910
Yeah. It'd go for that.

308
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:55,575
You find the gun?

309
00:18:55,675 --> 00:18:58,130
The wife fed it
to her pet snake.

310
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,160
That's why she had
meat sauce on her hands.

311
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,130
Did you find the snake?

312
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,055
We're looking
for it right now.

313
00:19:02,155 --> 00:19:04,125
You planning on coming by?

314
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:05,390
What i'm doing...

315
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,360
it's gonna take
a little longer.

316
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,125
Is this the part where i
ask what it is you're doing?

317
00:19:10,225 --> 00:19:12,500
Probably better if you didn't.

318
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,295
Nice ride.

319
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:23,210
Thank you. You want it?

320
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,595
What do you mean?

321
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:29,440
I mean,do you
want the car?

322
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,955
You're just gonna gimme your car?

323
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:35,200
You said you liked it.

324
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,900
Just like that?

325
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,990
Just like that.

326
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,845
This isn't some trick?

327
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:03,800
The trick is to not
become attached to the car.

328
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,170
What do you think he's doing?

329
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,810
I wouldn't know.

330
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,230
You think it's about a girl.

331
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,040
Charlie gets lots of girls.

332
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,615
I wouldn't know.

333
00:20:51,715 --> 00:20:54,385
I don't think it
was about a girl.

334
00:20:54,485 --> 00:20:58,660
Because now that i think
about it,Kinda had that look.

335
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,895
Oh,yeah? What
look is that?

336
00:21:00,995 --> 00:21:06,450
A look that he was about to do
something He'd be better off not doing.

337
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,200
Look like he had
that look to you?

338
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,640
*****kyle

339
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:47,878
{\a6}ted earley
ex-ceo attercliffe capital

340
00:21:47,977 --> 00:21:48,220
you say charlie saved
your life in prison.

341
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,540
How exactly did he do that?

342
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:56,490
He convinced some,um...people
to leave me alone.

343
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,290
How did he convince them?

344
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,855
In a way that
i was unable to.

345
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:05,250
You mean with violence.

346
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:13,760
If crews was set up And
found the person who did it,

347
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,840
What do you think he would do?

348
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,630
What would you do?

349
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,020
Too bad you can't kill me.

350
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,425
Come alone?

351
00:22:25,525 --> 00:22:27,165
I used to think
none of us were alone.

352
00:22:27,265 --> 00:22:28,815
Now i'm not so sure.

353
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:30,100
What's that supposed to mean?

354
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,830
It means i came alone,kyle.

355
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,605
You surprised
i called you?

356
00:22:34,705 --> 00:22:38,000
I made you call me,kyle.
- Yeah?

357
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,290
How'd you do that?

358
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,045
I squeezed carl ames.

359
00:22:41,145 --> 00:22:45,630
Ames squeezed jack
reese,and out popped you.

360
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:49,635
But you wanna know what's
it got to do with you.

361
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:54,910
You wanna know What's it got
to do with that dead family.

362
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,720
You get me to l.A.X.,

363
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:01,210
You get me on a plane With a
suitcase full of that settlement cash,

364
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:05,700
Then i'll call you with
what you wanna know.

365
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,860
Yeah,okay.

366
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,840
I got photos,i
got documents.

367
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,180
Anything happens to me,I
get tortured or i get dead,

368
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,950
Those documents and
photos,they go away.

369
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,500
Yeah,okay.

370
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,870
You killed my
friends,kyle.

371
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:59,990
When you killed that
family,you killed my friends.

372
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,910
Like fruit,kyle?

373
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,545
This is a pluot.

374
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,400
A dappled dandy,to be exact.

375
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,315
I grew this one myself.

376
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:11,600
Some people call
'em dinosaur eggs

377
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,815
Because,um,That's what
they kinda look like.

378
00:24:14,915 --> 00:24:16,940
Dinosaur eggs.

379
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:25,385
Now...i,uh,I know that there is all
sorts of information You wanna tell me.

380
00:24:25,485 --> 00:24:28,290
Questions you
think i wanna ask.

381
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,945
But that's not
important,because...

382
00:24:31,045 --> 00:24:37,400
Today... I have only
one decision to make.

383
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,960
You shouldn't have
killed my friends,kyle.

384
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,480
Let me ask you a
question,detective.

385
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,730
I.E.D. Comes to you.

386
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,350
Said what they said to me.

387
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,640
What would you have done?

388
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,110
step forward.

389
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,655
Slowly.

390
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:37,535
Behind me,isn't it?

391
00:25:37,635 --> 00:25:38,950
Yep.

392
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,820
Step forward slowly,please.

393
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,530
Let's go,get up. Let's go!

394
00:26:03,283 --> 00:26:03,347
{\a6}jennifer conover
ex-wife of charlie crews

395
00:26:03,382 --> 00:26:06,220
have you seen your ex-Husband
Since his release from prison?

396
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,815
Once.

397
00:26:07,915 --> 00:26:10,790
Is he a different man than
the one who went to prison?

398
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:15,360
I couldn't tell
you who he is now.

399
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,520
Thanks for coming,jennifer.

400
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,680
Well,if i didn't, you'd
pull my husband over

401
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:26,020
Or leave a horse
on my lawn,right?

402
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,590
I wanna ask you something.

403
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,580
what,charlie?

404
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,400
What could you
possibly want to ask me?

405
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,410
I want to ask you
for your forgiveness.

406
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:42,170
All that time i was
in prison,i was angry.

407
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,220
I was angry at you.

408
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,520
But we were so
young when it happened.

409
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,730
You were so young.

410
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,410
Anyone would've
done what you did.

411
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,910
Charlie-- -
Let me finish.

412
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:07,070
I was angry at the wrong person,And
now i'm asking for your forgiveness.

413
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,510
Okay.

414
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,640
I gotta go.

415
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:31,070
How's it going
in there,kyle?

416
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:39,675
The first six months i was in
solitary,I did pushups everyday,

417
00:27:39,775 --> 00:27:41,990
and i never talked to myself.

418
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:46,215
The next six months,i stopped
doing pushups And i-- I confess.

419
00:27:46,315 --> 00:27:48,970
I did talk a little to myself.

420
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:58,415
The six months after
that,Those next six months...

421
00:27:58,515 --> 00:28:04,000
Kyle... You don't wanna
know what happened then.

422
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,390
is that a new car?

423
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,495
Do you like it?

424
00:28:09,595 --> 00:28:13,250
Well,it looks,uh,Roomy.

425
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,870
Tell me what you found
out about jack reese.

426
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:21,845
Every year,jack reese Would give
$250 to his favorite charity.

427
00:28:21,945 --> 00:28:23,045
Right,like clockwork.

428
00:28:23,145 --> 00:28:25,145
All through the '70s and '80s.

429
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:30,810
That $250 check Would go
to the blessed sisters.

430
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,340
Is everything
okay with you?

431
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,520
Ted,i'm fine.

432
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,655
Okay.

433
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:36,560
And then?

434
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,650
And then...

435
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:41,215
Just four months after
the bank of l.A. Robbery,

436
00:28:41,315 --> 00:28:47,315
The blessed sisters receive an
anonymous check For $4 million.

437
00:28:47,415 --> 00:28:48,405
Anonymous.

438
00:28:48,505 --> 00:28:52,655
An untraceable cashier's check
From a cayman island account.

439
00:28:52,755 --> 00:28:54,430
Now,who does that,charlie?

440
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,150
You give to a charity
to take the deduction.

441
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:00,875
You don't send in a
check with no name.

442
00:29:00,975 --> 00:29:03,330
Four months after the robbery?

443
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,400
So what do you think?

444
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,535
Either he's laundering or...

445
00:29:07,635 --> 00:29:08,930
Or?

446
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,525
Or it's guilt
money. But...

447
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,370
That's bank of
l.A. Money,ted.

448
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,180
Charlie?

449
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:24,050
I'm not alfred,am i?

450
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,820
Alfred?

451
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,360
You know,batman and alfred.

452
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:36,620
No. No,ted. You're not alfred.

453
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,555
I'm not higgins.

454
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:42,410
Charlie,tell me
i'm not higgins!

455
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,340
Hello?

456
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,680
hey,how's your day,jack?

457
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,640
It's charlie crews.

458
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,760
What the hell do you want?

459
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,420
Do you know what i wish?

460
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,140
I wish that the day
before i was arrested,

461
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,870
Someone had told me that this was
gonna be my last day As a free man.

462
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,500
I'm not sure i
care about that.

463
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,875
Well,you should,jack.

464
00:30:06,975 --> 00:30:09,525
'Cause that's what
i'm telling you now.

465
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:11,950
This is your last day.

466
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,360
Where's the preacher?

467
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,055
We saw you in
indio,detective.

468
00:31:01,155 --> 00:31:03,290
So we're gonna
ask you once more.

469
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,685
Where's the preacher?

470
00:31:04,785 --> 00:31:06,320
Are you upside-Down
or am i upside-Down?

471
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,630
It's kind of hard to tell.

472
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,425
Should we do him now?

473
00:31:09,525 --> 00:31:11,350
Not yet.

474
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,610
I know you.

475
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,455
You were standing in the park with jack
reese When he was arguing with ames.

476
00:31:17,555 --> 00:31:19,910
You killed ames.

477
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,205
You're not really cops,are you?

478
00:31:24,305 --> 00:31:26,840
No,not really.

479
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,050
Check the trunk.

480
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,540
But we took your gun.

481
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,360
You're a real
popular guy,kyle.

482
00:32:13,293 --> 00:32:13,357
{\a6}jennifer conover
ex-wife of charlie crews

483
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:16,810
if you could say one thing to
charlie crews,What would it be?

484
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:21,240
I'd want him to live his life.

485
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,180
Does that make sense?

486
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,250
what are you doing?

487
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,400
What are you doing?!

488
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,810
I got right,you understand?

489
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:39,675
After what happened,Who
i was,I got right.

490
00:32:39,775 --> 00:32:43,550
Fire found me,cleaned
me out,I got right.

491
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:44,845
I got right!

492
00:32:44,945 --> 00:32:46,585
Made myself a new man.

493
00:32:46,685 --> 00:32:47,960
Made myself a family.

494
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,550
I got right!

495
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,115
What are you doing?!

496
00:32:52,215 --> 00:32:53,800
Tell me.

497
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,670
Okay.

498
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,445
I was jack reese's
confidential informant.

499
00:33:06,545 --> 00:33:07,955
Worked for him too.

500
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:13,230
I would get calls to pick up
envelopes,Drop off envelopes from that bar.

501
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,160
From your bar.

502
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,915
Those envelopes
were filled with cash.

503
00:33:18,015 --> 00:33:25,340
Your friend seybolt was laundering
money For jack and his friends. Okay?

504
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,495
And one night
i got the call.

505
00:33:28,595 --> 00:33:30,620
"Go straighten tom out."

506
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,040
He was skimming.

507
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,915
I went there.

508
00:33:39,015 --> 00:33:41,075
It got out of hand.

509
00:33:41,175 --> 00:33:42,955
Wife was there.

510
00:33:43,055 --> 00:33:45,160
She was screaming.

511
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,000
The kid...

512
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,020
I was jacked up.

513
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:59,250
I... I killed that family.

514
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,750
But i didn't set you up.

515
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,700
What are you doing?!

516
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,725
Some of the bank money
they-- They took¡ª

517
00:34:13,825 --> 00:34:17,520
It got washed through that
bar,and that's all i know.

518
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:20,410
I got no papers.

519
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,450
I got no documents.

520
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,610
That's all i know.

521
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,510
I got right.

522
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,830
The fire found me.

523
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,955
I killed that family,but
i didn't set you up.

524
00:34:38,055 --> 00:34:42,110
I didn't. I didn't.

525

00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,980
You need to come in now.

00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,390
Please.

530
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,230
What are you doing?

531
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,990
Dig a hole,Fill it up.

532
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:05,645
you know,You'll need a warrant
to cut that out of there.

533
00:36:05,745 --> 00:36:07,440
Basic fourth amendment stuff.

534
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,345
You look like
crap,charlie.

535
00:36:09,445 --> 00:36:11,020
Where you been?

536
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,610
I need you to do
something for me.

537
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,940
Both of us?

538
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:39,900
It's 1991,jack.

539
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:43,320
You got real problems, crews.

540
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,850
It's 1991,jack.

541
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:48,155
You're up here
with your swat buddies,

542
00:36:48,255 --> 00:36:50,195
Six guys come out of
the bank down there,

543
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:52,800
And you take out five of 'em.

544
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:56,690
Then you start
washing the cash.

545
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,945
Then more people start to die.

546
00:36:59,045 --> 00:37:00,925
Then my friend tom gets
into business with you.

547
00:37:01,025 --> 00:37:04,720
And... He and
his family die too.

548
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,925
Ames dies.

549
00:37:06,025 --> 00:37:07,990
Why,jack?

550
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,965
He starts drinking himself
to death when i went away.

551
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:14,980
He feel guilty
about what happened?

552
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,360
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

553
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,875
It's 1991,jack.

554
00:37:25,975 --> 00:37:27,615
It's all connected.

555
00:37:27,715 --> 00:37:29,585
Hollis connects
you to the bank.

556
00:37:29,685 --> 00:37:32,530
Hollis connects you to
the seybolt killings.

557
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:37,380
Hollis is connected to me,and
now,jack,Now i am connected to you.

558
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,845
I thought i told you to
keep my daughter out of this.

559
00:37:41,945 --> 00:37:45,010
Your daughter doesn't know
who i'm up here talking with.

560
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,550
Her partner said he needed
her,and that's all she needed.

561
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:52,420
Come in now,jack.

562
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,300
It's over.

563
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,030
Hollis is gonna roll on you.

564
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,055
You wanna make
a deal with me.

565
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:02,670
Come in now,jack.

566
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,760
Get right with your
daughter,cut a deal with the d.A.

567
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,740
It's over. It's done.

568
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,470
It's all connected,isn't it?

569
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:23,940
I think,detective crews,I'll
stay up here a while longer.

570
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,855
Charlie,it's over.

571
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:35,830
Hollis killed those
people,connie,that family.

572
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:39,100
But he's not the
one who set me up.

573
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,620
It's bigger than hollis.

574
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,880
It doesn't stop with him.

575
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,370
I know.

576
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,600
But let somebody else do it.

577
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,910
Let somebody else do it.

578
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:58,385
I got a lot of
questions for you.

579
00:39:58,485 --> 00:39:59,775
You may not like the answers.

580
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:01,940
I usually don't.

581
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,655
This is crews.

582
00:40:09,755 --> 00:40:11,600
Hey,charlie. Jack reese.

583
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,860
This a good time for you?

584
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,965
Thought about
my offer,jack?

585
00:40:20,065 --> 00:40:21,725
We can get to
that in a minute.

586
00:40:21,825 --> 00:40:23,555
First i want to
congratulate you.

587
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:24,975
You caught the killer.

588
00:40:25,075 --> 00:40:26,960
You're next. You know that.

589
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,355
That is not gonna happen.

590
00:40:28,455 --> 00:40:32,285
Because,detective crews,I
have something you want.

591
00:40:32,385 --> 00:40:34,490
What could you
have that i want?

592
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,360
I have the girl.

593
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,085
The one you're looking for.

594
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,085
I have rachel seybolt.

595
00:40:40,185 --> 00:40:41,820
You don't know her.

596
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,705
No,crews,you don't know her.

597
00:40:43,805 --> 00:40:47,600
You didn't even recognize her
When she was bleeding in your arms.

598
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:52,260
You don't know her,crews.

599
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,025
i need the status
of a patient,a girl.

600
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:06,975
Last name hollis.

601
00:41:07,075 --> 00:41:09,270
just one moment.

602
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,050
Hmm,that's strange.

603
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:11,775
What is?

604
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:13,435
Her record is
not here anymore.

605
00:41:13,535 --> 00:41:14,330
It was here before.

606
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,475
I know,'cause i
checked her in myself.

607
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:17,475
Let me try again.

608
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:20,175
I'm not good with technology.

609
00:41:20,275 --> 00:41:22,505
No. That is so odd.

610
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,770
I can't understand.
