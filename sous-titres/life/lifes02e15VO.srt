1
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,544
The house has no roof.

2
00:00:12,233 --> 00:00:12,964
Noticed that.

3
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:14,504
All the other houses have a roof.

4
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:15,399
Noticed that.

5
00:00:15,884 --> 00:00:17,319
Maybe someone stole it.

6
00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:18,796
Who would steal a roof?

7
00:00:18,921 --> 00:00:20,443
Hmm... maybe kids stole it.

8
00:00:21,913 --> 00:00:24,274
Kids will steal anything that
isn't nailed down, anything.

9
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,105
I know I did when I was a kid.

10
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:27,718
Ah... body's upstairs.

11
00:00:28,498 --> 00:00:29,506
Ladies first.

12
00:00:39,986 --> 00:00:43,125
Traffic chopper flying over saw
it this morning. Called it in.

13
00:00:43,902 --> 00:00:45,257
With this housing market,

14
00:00:45,907 --> 00:00:48,492
That chopper doesn't see him, he
could've been up there for months.

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,979
Why is he up here at all?

16
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,008
Sand on floor...

17
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,109
Birds nests

18
00:00:53,779 --> 00:00:55,111
This roof's been off awhile.

19
00:00:55,211 --> 00:00:58,423
Don't they usually take the old roof off
one day and put the new one the next?

20
00:00:58,523 --> 00:01:01,976
Got a 73 Al Camino up front.
Registered to a Roy McCullough.

21
00:01:02,316 --> 00:01:04,322
"JHY Construction".

22
00:01:04,422 --> 00:01:05,727
Hmmm... construction.

23
00:01:05,948 --> 00:01:06,839
No tools.

24
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:08,024
No roof either.

25
00:01:09,423 --> 00:01:10,940
Maybe someone stole it.

26
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:14,962
Aah... got bruises on the face.

27
00:01:15,958 --> 00:01:17,017
Neck and arms.

28
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:19,251
One gunshot wound to the chest.
Very nice

29
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:20,395
Beaten and shot.

30
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:22,235
Ah... better shacked than sorry I guess.

31
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,710
Pockets are empty.

32
00:01:45,796 --> 00:01:47,473
This guys mouth full of twenties

33
00:01:49,054 --> 00:01:50,192
Not a robbery come back.

34
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:53,585
Oh, there's got to be...

35
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,391
There's got to be a couple
hundreds in here at least

36
00:01:57,176 --> 00:01:59,220
Oh, it looks like it's
jammed all the way down there.

37
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,286
Not jammed.

38
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,133
Shoved.

39
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:06,240
As in "I'm gonna shove that money
all the way down your throat".

40
00:02:10,154 --> 00:02:11,714
I don't think kids did this.

41
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:12,715
Relec/Resynchro: Lafeelicita,
Grischka, PerkosDhed Marc-Anthony

42
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:13,716
SeriesSub.com

43
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,305
- Chicken and ribs.
- Ribs?

44
00:02:33,557 --> 00:02:34,415
Chicken?

45
00:02:34,515 --> 00:02:36,962
Eh, why choose when you can have both?

46
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:38,510
Here you go.

47
00:02:40,587 --> 00:02:41,722
Lemonade?

48
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,601
Uh, this is JHY Construction?

49
00:02:46,013 --> 00:02:46,907
It is.

50
00:02:47,284 --> 00:02:48,555
And you do roofs?

51
00:02:48,817 --> 00:02:51,729
Yeah, but let's not talk business yet.
How long have you two been together?

52
00:02:51,854 --> 00:02:53,910
What do you say,
Sasha, about two years?

53
00:02:54,035 --> 00:02:55,552
Looks like two years, yeah.

54
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:57,954
It has actually been about two years.
How do you know that?

55
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,329
Over three years, you stand
further apart. Much further.

56
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:03,614
And newlyweds hold hands,
but still you two seem like...

57
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:05,747
we're not married. We're partners.

58
00:03:05,872 --> 00:03:07,098
She has commitment issues.

59
00:03:07,223 --> 00:03:08,192
Who needs a piece of paper

60
00:03:08,317 --> 00:03:09,647
as long as you got a
roof over your head?

61
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:12,181
A roof over our heads, now
you're talking business.

62
00:03:12,306 --> 00:03:13,832
- Isn't that why you're here?
- No.

63
00:03:15,619 --> 00:03:16,695
We're detectives.

64
00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:19,573
Did a Roy McCullough work here?

65
00:03:24,527 --> 00:03:26,671
Roy and I, we lived together.

66
00:03:28,398 --> 00:03:31,505
The house Roy was found in
had its roof taken off.

67
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:34,142
That's something your company does.

68
00:03:34,344 --> 00:03:35,788
We usually put them back on too.

69
00:03:35,913 --> 00:03:37,520
This would have been off for a while.

70
00:03:38,214 --> 00:03:40,565
Any reason why you'd take a roof off
and not put it back on?

71
00:03:41,436 --> 00:03:42,586
We'll need to see your records.

72
00:03:42,711 --> 00:03:44,185
Make sure it wasn't one of your jobs.

73
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:45,631
Yeah, of course. I'll get them.

74
00:03:45,756 --> 00:03:47,951
And we need to know where
you two were last night.

75
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,937
Right here, both of us.
It's the end of our tax year.

76
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,586
We were hunkered down working the books.

77
00:03:51,653 --> 00:03:53,506
Roy was supposed to help,
but he didn't show up.

78
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,553
Either of you own a gun?

79
00:03:59,017 --> 00:04:01,256
You know anyone who'd want to hurt Roy?

80
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:09,297
Roy had... other interests.

81
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,626
This business wasn't enough for him.

82
00:04:13,651 --> 00:04:16,009
What business was enough for him?

83
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,716
Do you think after a few years
we'll stand further apart?

84
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:25,056
That'd be sad.

85
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:27,157
Crews, we're not a couple.

86
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:28,217
Oh, yeah.

87
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:30,246
Still, it'd be sad.

88
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:32,377
Time driving a wedge between us.

89
00:04:32,502 --> 00:04:33,894
Oh, "roof raisers".

90
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:37,034
"Wenderson's roofing".
"Schienbloom and sons".

91
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:39,128
He's got a lot of signs here

92
00:04:39,253 --> 00:04:40,394
but no roofing supplies.

93
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,872
Yeah, there were no roofing supplies
in the attic either,

94
00:04:42,997 --> 00:04:44,126
'cause there was never
gonna be a new roof.

95
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,872
All these companies, you know,
I'll bet none of this is legit.

96
00:04:47,263 --> 00:04:48,756
Looks like our Roy was working a scam.

97
00:04:49,843 --> 00:04:52,833
Most likely these companies
didn't do anything.

98
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:54,698
Well, let's go find out
who these companies

99
00:04:54,823 --> 00:04:55,794
didn't do anything to.

100
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,191
"Who these companies
didn't do anything to"?

101
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:01,842
- Do you have to talk like that?
- Like what?

102
00:05:03,124 --> 00:05:05,861
I don't think I talk differently
than anyone else talks.

103
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,466
Maybe sometimes I don't not say things

104
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:09,747
that other people don't not say,

105
00:05:09,872 --> 00:05:12,136
but most other people don't not say
the same things I don't.

106
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:13,813
You know what I'm saying?

107
00:05:15,225 --> 00:05:16,941
Red Pesca?

108
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:19,600
Yeah, I see you staring.

109
00:05:19,907 --> 00:05:21,815
My hair was Red when I was a kid.

110
00:05:22,895 --> 00:05:24,865
Then I got the nickname,

111
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,446
then I grew up and it changed.

112
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:29,573
I kept the name 'cause
"salt and pepper Pesca... "

113
00:05:29,698 --> 00:05:30,870
sounds like a pasta dish?

114
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:35,760
Actually I was staring
at the whole winter wonderland thing.

115
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:36,794
Oh, right.

116
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,144
Yeah, I dress like this 24/7.

117
00:05:39,726 --> 00:05:42,097
Ever since I hired
"Murrigan and sons" roofers.

118
00:05:42,891 --> 00:05:43,717
I got the flu.

119
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,133
The whole family's got it

120
00:05:45,258 --> 00:05:47,912
since we sleep in a house with no roof.

121
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,581
You can't get the flu from being cold.

122
00:05:51,706 --> 00:05:52,518
The flu's a virus.

123
00:05:53,151 --> 00:05:55,354
Well, then we all got colds.

124
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,524
Well, the cold is a virus too.

125
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:01,235
Then we all got whatever
you get from being cold.

126
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,481
Well, you get cold.

127
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:03,933
But not a cold.

128
00:06:04,058 --> 00:06:07,177
Mr. Pesca we saw the better
business bureau complaint.

129
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,536
Right, they were real reliable
at taking the old roof off.

130
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,334
But then that Roy guy,

131
00:06:12,927 --> 00:06:16,235
he wanted to charge
triple what we'd agreed

132
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:17,973
to put the new one on.

133
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,941
So I said, "no, I'd sue".
And he said, "go right ahead.

134
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,915
I'll just declare bankruptcy
and open a new company".

135
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:26,179
Not a bad little game.

136
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:27,561
That woulda made me mad.

137
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:28,663
Does that make you mad, Red?

138
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,494
No, I just laugh things off.

139
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,218
My doctor says you live longer that way.

140
00:06:38,972 --> 00:06:40,588
We hired rain go away roofing

141
00:06:40,713 --> 00:06:42,305
to put a new roof on
our mid-century modern.

142
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,214
He took the old one off

143
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:44,903
and then disappeared
with our deposit check.

144
00:06:45,284 --> 00:06:47,089
We called but the number
he gave us was disconnected.

145
00:06:47,214 --> 00:06:49,118
But everything worked out okay.

146
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,029
- How's that?
- We decided to do the work ourselves,

147
00:06:52,154 --> 00:06:53,515
and it strengthened our bond.

148
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,700
You can watch us on the web.

149
00:06:54,825 --> 00:06:57,708
WWW dot andy and rory put
on their own roof dot com.

150
00:06:57,989 --> 00:07:00,368
- Would you like to be on our show?
- What would I have to do?

151
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,225
Can you work a router?

152
00:07:04,546 --> 00:07:07,163
Mrs. Ford, it says here
you wrote a lot of checks

153
00:07:07,288 --> 00:07:09,520
to a company called "a
roof of our own" limited.

154
00:07:09,785 --> 00:07:10,466
Yes.

155
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,130
Most everything I had.

156
00:07:12,357 --> 00:07:14,107
A by "a roof of our own",

157
00:07:14,232 --> 00:07:15,463
you mean Roy McCullough?

158
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,417
Nice young man.

159
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:18,703
Polite.

160
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:21,354
I have nothing bad to say about him.

161
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:22,985
Except that he stole most of your money.

162
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,701
He was so polite.

163
00:07:25,285 --> 00:07:26,858
I baked him cookies.

164
00:07:26,983 --> 00:07:28,571
Why so many checks, Mrs. Ford?

165
00:07:28,696 --> 00:07:29,805
Well, he kept saying

166
00:07:29,873 --> 00:07:31,883
he'd lost the one I'd given him,

167
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:33,691
so I'd write another.

168
00:07:33,816 --> 00:07:36,541
- Then he'd lose that one.
- And you trusted him with your money?

169
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:38,264
Well, why wouldn't I?

170
00:07:39,096 --> 00:07:40,171
He was so polite.

171
00:07:40,474 --> 00:07:41,210
Yes.

172
00:07:41,936 --> 00:07:42,893
He was.

173
00:07:44,873 --> 00:07:47,681
But I guess he was just a
thieving prick in the end.

174
00:08:00,489 --> 00:08:01,721
Home, Finn.

175
00:08:08,117 --> 00:08:10,923
Oh, detective Crews.

176
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:13,634
Where's Finn?

177
00:08:16,806 --> 00:08:18,745
I suppose that is Finn.

178
00:08:20,242 --> 00:08:21,831
Why won't you just call?

179
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:24,605
I guess you've got a
big question to ask me.

180
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,723
Why did you want me to
go after Roman Nevikov?

181
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:29,383
Were you always so
serious even as a child?

182
00:08:29,712 --> 00:08:31,421
Look, your driver's in the trunk.

183
00:08:31,546 --> 00:08:34,274
Your security guard is cuffed to
a pipe back at the garage.

184
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,122
Maybe you want to tell me what you know.

185
00:08:36,247 --> 00:08:38,725
You gotta laugh, Charlie,
or you're never getting out of here.

186
00:08:41,069 --> 00:08:42,665
Okay, detective sourpuss,

187
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,919
I'll tell you what you wanna know.

188
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:47,609
But there's something
I need to show you.

189
00:08:48,132 --> 00:08:50,046
It's gonna take me a
little while to get.

190
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,156
So why don't you come back

191
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:53,874
and see me then?

192
00:08:57,684 --> 00:08:59,019
How many complaints on this guy?

193
00:08:59,144 --> 00:09:00,020
About 60.

194
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:03,688
He underestimated someone,
ripped them off, they whacked him.

195
00:09:03,813 --> 00:09:05,035
That was Reese's theory.

196
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,236
It's a good theory.

197
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,700
Doesn't explain the money
shoved down the throat.

198
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:10,257
He was sending a message.

199
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:11,235
Who to?

200
00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:13,760
Who'd see a guy in the
attic of a vacant house?

201
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,291
Well, that's what the taxpayers of LA
Are paying you to find out.

202
00:09:18,287 --> 00:09:19,570
Is that a new suit?

203
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,122
Nice. Where'd you get it?

204
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:25,522
At the, uh, suit store.

205
00:09:26,754 --> 00:09:27,482
Which one?

206
00:09:30,576 --> 00:09:31,975
I don't remember.

207
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,280
Didn't buy it yourself?

208
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,380
It was a gift.

209
00:09:39,544 --> 00:09:41,156
Is this where I say "unfreeze"?

210
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,582
Guess who owned the house
our victim was found in

211
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,453
before the bank foreclosed.

212
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:47,812
Red Pesca.

213
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:51,795
Two houses, no roofs,

214
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,214
salt and pepper hair, and a cold.

215
00:09:57,445 --> 00:09:59,160
Just stay where you are, Red.

216
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,887
And put your hands...

217
00:10:01,606 --> 00:10:03,769
put your gloves
where we can see 'em.

218
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,188
Truth doesn't seem to
be your strong suit, Red.

219
00:10:07,489 --> 00:10:10,454
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I think what detective Reese means

220
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:12,258
is that you lied to us

221
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:15,322
when you said the ex-Roy McCullough
was found dead in your ex-house.

222
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:16,919
You gotta believe me.

223
00:10:17,354 --> 00:10:18,911
I didn't kill anybody.

224
00:10:19,113 --> 00:10:20,679
Remember the part where you lie?

225
00:10:23,726 --> 00:10:27,145
So... everybody and their aunt Marie

226
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:28,726
is making money flipping.

227
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,451
You take the equity
out of your house

228
00:10:30,576 --> 00:10:32,016
and you use that to buy
a second house.

229
00:10:32,141 --> 00:10:33,377
You double your money.

230
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:34,943
But not Red Pesca.

231
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:36,642
No, the minute I try it,

232
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:39,088
the whole housing market
just dries up like that, poof.

233
00:10:39,213 --> 00:10:40,227
And Roy McCullough?

234
00:10:40,352 --> 00:10:42,590
He offered me two roofs
for the price of one.

235
00:10:43,082 --> 00:10:44,101
And you got no roofs?

236
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,450
Right, so I can't sell the house

237
00:10:46,575 --> 00:10:49,136
I'm flipping with no roof, and
I got no money left to put one on.

238
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:50,767
And so the bank forecloses.

239
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:51,918
Yes!

240
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:58,138
Wow, that's some cold you got there.

241
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,900
You want to take those off
for us, Red?

242
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:03,016
I sure don't.

243
00:11:03,141 --> 00:11:04,871
Okay, well, we can get a warrant.

244
00:11:05,943 --> 00:11:08,034
- For my gloves?
- For what's under them.

245
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,965
All right.

246
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,011
Let's see those hands, Red.

247
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,639
Hey, sit back down now, Red.

248
00:11:24,546 --> 00:11:25,578
He's punching...

249
00:11:25,703 --> 00:11:26,760
the wall.

250
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:28,830
I guess laughter doesn't
work after all.

251
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,848
We should probably stop him.

252
00:11:39,863 --> 00:11:40,834
Feel better?

253
00:11:41,212 --> 00:11:42,082
Much.

254
00:12:00,711 --> 00:12:01,846
Hi, Ann.

255
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:03,321
Hi.

256
00:12:03,446 --> 00:12:06,110
Oh, I almost fell over
when you called.

257
00:12:06,235 --> 00:12:08,435
Not really fell over,
that's an expression.

258
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,588
But you know that.

259
00:12:09,713 --> 00:12:11,546
Does your mom know that you called?

260
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:12,723
No.

261
00:12:14,469 --> 00:12:16,859
You've grown so much.

262
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:19,018
Okay.

263
00:12:19,384 --> 00:12:23,018
You're... a beautiful young woman.

264
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:25,146
Sure.

265
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:29,706
Ann, you can call me
"dad" if you want to.

266
00:12:31,013 --> 00:12:31,917
I don't.

267
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,006
Are you gonna let me in?

268
00:12:38,288 --> 00:12:38,963
Yes.

269
00:12:44,654 --> 00:12:47,798
Ann, who the hell are they?

270
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:51,395
Oh, they're my crew.

271
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:56,103
Punch a wall?

272
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:58,335
Let off steam?

273
00:12:59,097 --> 00:13:00,112
That's right.

274
00:13:00,837 --> 00:13:02,364
- Doctor says...
- you'll live longer.

275
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:05,149
Looks like you got
some scabs already.

276
00:13:05,943 --> 00:13:07,953
I guess I punched a wall last week.

277
00:13:08,176 --> 00:13:09,871
Or you punched something else.

278
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:11,848
You punched that wall
to let off steam?

279
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:13,342
Or to cover up what was
already on your hands?

280
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:15,208
Where'd you get those scabs, Red?

281
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:16,639
What else u been punching?

282
00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:18,606
Lunched a wall last week.

283
00:13:20,687 --> 00:13:22,135
My partner has ESP

284
00:13:22,407 --> 00:13:23,275
Did you know that?

285
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,445
No, I sure didn't.

286
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,690
Well, he's gonna look
into your future now,

287
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:28,267
no charge.

288
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:29,766
We're gonna test your DNA.

289
00:13:30,104 --> 00:13:31,713
Then we're gonna
check out the ad guy.

290
00:13:32,138 --> 00:13:34,771
And the results are gonna show
your DNA all over the dead guy.

291
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:36,045
Is he right?

292
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,983
I'm gonna look further
into your future, Red.

293
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,027
I see a house.

294
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,443
This one's got a roof on it.

295
00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:43,488
It's a big house
with bars and walls.

296
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,085
There are guards on the
walls. It's always noisy.

297
00:13:46,849 --> 00:13:49,090
There's yelling and
crying, and a weird laugh

298
00:13:49,215 --> 00:13:50,666
that sounds like a cry.

299
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,539
And there isn't any fruit, ever.

300
00:13:57,187 --> 00:13:58,827
How does that future sound?

301
00:14:00,616 --> 00:14:01,609
Hang on.

302
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:04,531
Okay, yeah, I went to
the guy's office

303
00:14:04,656 --> 00:14:06,359
to get my money back.

304
00:14:07,557 --> 00:14:09,636
And, you know, he laughed at me,
and,

305
00:14:10,523 --> 00:14:11,547
before I knew what I was doing,

306
00:14:11,672 --> 00:14:14,216
I was all over him, but
I didn't kill anybody.

307
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:15,757
Red, I think you're a smart guy.

308
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:16,948
- Really?
- Really?

309
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:18,166
And I gotta ask...

310
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,947
why'd you go for the
"two-roofs-for-one" deal

311
00:14:20,072 --> 00:14:21,238
in the first place?

312
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:25,656
Because that woman who worked there.

313
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:26,992
Sasha?

314
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:27,985
Sasha.

315
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,793
Yeah, one smile from
her and I whipped out...

316
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:32,937
the checkbook.

317
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,972
Checkbook.

318
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,322
I really don't believe
in the future.

319
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:44,308
I know.

320
00:14:46,337 --> 00:14:48,734
There is no future.
There's just now.

321
00:14:49,891 --> 00:14:51,518
I know, Crews. I'm...

322
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:52,807
yes.

323
00:14:53,523 --> 00:14:54,402
Got it.

324
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:55,542
All right, thanks.

325
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:56,775
ME's office.

326
00:14:57,242 --> 00:15:00,315
Roy was beaten several
hours before he was shot.

327
00:15:00,644 --> 00:15:02,918
So Red beats him then shoots him?

328
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:04,803
Or he's telling us the truth and...

329
00:15:04,928 --> 00:15:06,789
he only beats him.

330
00:15:07,568 --> 00:15:09,908
When you've got cash
flow problems like Red,

331
00:15:10,563 --> 00:15:13,328
found money goes into your wallet,
not down a dead guy's throat.

332
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:16,827
60 complaints to the
better business bureau.

333
00:15:17,085 --> 00:15:19,458
Only one complaint
withdrawn, a Mary Ford.

334
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,148
Why do you file a complaint,
and then withdraw it?

335
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,132
So one of us should go
talk to old Mary Ford,

336
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:29,386
- and the other one...
- Should go talk to Sasha.

337
00:15:32,493 --> 00:15:35,066
All right, just keep your
checkbook in your pants.

338
00:15:37,021 --> 00:15:38,779
I don't really know the Pescas.
Roy just asked me

339
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,564
to deliver some papers there
a couple times.

340
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,562
Well, we call that being
an accessory.

341
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,452
To what?

342
00:15:44,852 --> 00:15:45,984
Conspiracy, fraud,

343
00:15:46,109 --> 00:15:46,987
grand theft.

344
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:48,794
The DA's office will add some later.

345
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:49,774
They're good at that.

346
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:51,443
Believe me, really good at that.

347
00:15:51,705 --> 00:15:52,925
I don't even know
anything about this.

348
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,139
Oh, come on, Sasha.

349
00:15:54,264 --> 00:15:55,743
Roy may have kept the
business names separate,

350
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:57,074
but you were all in this together.

351
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,573
No, I just delivered some papers.

352
00:15:58,698 --> 00:16:00,372
Detective, this business is legal.

353
00:16:00,497 --> 00:16:02,461
Well, I got 60 people on
record disagreeing with you.

354
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:05,116
They don't read the fine print,
it's not our problem.

355
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,590
Kids, you stole people's roofs.

356
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:10,165
It's what makes a house a home...

357
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,397
a roof over your head.

358
00:16:11,522 --> 00:16:13,688
People like their roof.
It makes 'em feel safe.

359
00:16:13,813 --> 00:16:16,666
People don't feel safe, they do
stupid things, violent things.

360
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,763
I don't know what Roy
was doing, I don't.

361
00:16:18,888 --> 00:16:21,646
But we run a legitimate business.
So please, just stop.

362
00:16:22,655 --> 00:16:24,421
Detective Crews' job
is to talk to anybody

363
00:16:24,546 --> 00:16:25,525
who might be involved.

364
00:16:25,935 --> 00:16:28,000
He's just talking to
the wrong people,

365
00:16:28,536 --> 00:16:29,654
that's all.

366
00:16:30,506 --> 00:16:32,679
Well, guess I'm not getting ribs.

367
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:35,139
What a beautiful home, Mrs. Ford.

368
00:16:35,264 --> 00:16:36,478
It's William's.

369
00:16:36,603 --> 00:16:38,845
Everything here is William's.

370
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:42,688
I can't live in my house.

371
00:16:42,813 --> 00:16:44,722
It's got no roof.

372
00:16:44,847 --> 00:16:46,054
And William is?

373
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:47,421
My son.

374
00:16:47,546 --> 00:16:50,521
Actually, he's more like
the daughter I never had.

375
00:16:50,646 --> 00:16:53,187
He takes me antiquing.

376
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,922
We exchange recipes.

377
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,622
I tell him he should find
a nice girl and settle down,

378
00:16:57,747 --> 00:17:01,989
but he says the only girl
he's interested in is me.

379
00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:04,155
Well, he sounds very sweet.

380
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,055
And a little off, if you ask me.

381
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,388
Mrs. Ford, I do want to ask you

382
00:17:09,513 --> 00:17:11,521
about withdrawing your complaint

383
00:17:11,646 --> 00:17:13,022
against Roy McCullough.

384
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:14,388
The prick.

385
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:16,113
William asked me to.

386
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,756
There's no eating the store.

387
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:34,922
It's just an...

388
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:36,856
an apple. I know, I can ell it.

389
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:38,756
And you're not eating
it in this store.

390
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:41,856
You'll get down to the core,

391
00:17:41,981 --> 00:17:43,789
and then you won't know
where to put it,

392
00:17:43,914 --> 00:17:45,923
and then you'll stick it in a vase

393
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:49,222
like that was of gum
I found over there.

394
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:50,723
What if I eat the core?

395
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:53,889
What, seeds and all?

396
00:17:54,014 --> 00:17:57,256
Can't see you if you're
nodding your head.

397
00:17:57,381 --> 00:17:59,555
Seeds and all.

398
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,256
That a girl you got there with you?

399
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,289
He can smell your...

400
00:18:05,414 --> 00:18:06,656
essence.

401
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:09,189
Girlie, you better make
sure eats the seeds.

402
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,511
You might want to call her
"detective girlie". She gets touchy.

403
00:18:11,594 --> 00:18:12,594
Detective.

404
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:13,752
You cops

405
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:15,465
Are you William Ford?

406
00:18:15,548 --> 00:18:17,296
Do I look like Willie Ford?

407
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:18,722
I'm William Ford.

408
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:26,354
Mom called and said you were coming.

409
00:18:28,043 --> 00:18:30,677
- Nice lady, your mom.
- The best of the best.

410
00:18:31,142 --> 00:18:34,042
She didn't deserve to
get ripped off like that.

411
00:18:34,252 --> 00:18:35,947
You asked her to withdraw
her complaint.

412
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,830
Well, we prayed on it, and it just
seemed like the right thing to do.

413
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:41,963
- Turn the other cheek.
- Yes.

414
00:18:42,441 --> 00:18:44,241
Enough hate in this world.

415
00:18:47,275 --> 00:18:49,713
William Ford, aka "Sweet William".

416
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:50,967
Aggravated assault,

417
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,199
aggravated assault,
aggravated assault.

418
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:55,925
- He's easily aggravated.
- Rode with the vandals out San Berdoo.

419
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,650
This guy dropped a dime on William.

420
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:59,731
Ended up with his tongue
being cut out.

421
00:18:59,814 --> 00:19:01,121
Case unsolved.

422
00:19:01,204 --> 00:19:02,827
This guy leaned on his bike.

423
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,474
Somehow had all his fingers broken.
Assailant unknown.

424
00:19:06,557 --> 00:19:08,397
This guy stole biker gang drugs.

425
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,647
Found him at the beach,

426
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,139
a large bore hypodermic
needle jammed in his heart.

427
00:19:12,222 --> 00:19:14,893
That pour schmuck Roy
didn't scam the wrong guy.

428
00:19:14,976 --> 00:19:17,155
He scammed the wrong guy's mother.

429
00:19:19,706 --> 00:19:22,231
Mr. Apple and detective girlie.

430
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:24,467
And you brought friends.

431
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,290
Anything you have to say,
you probably want to speak up.

432
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,325
Yeah, why do you say that?

433
00:19:29,408 --> 00:19:31,377
It's about to get really
loud in here.

434
00:19:39,773 --> 00:19:40,868
Hands up.

435
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,298
Slowly.

436
00:19:43,127 --> 00:19:44,343
Very slowly.

437
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:47,990
Don't worry...

438
00:19:50,243 --> 00:19:51,759
it's not loaded.

439
00:20:21,224 --> 00:20:22,890
You got yourself a boat?

440
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:23,641
No.

441
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,175
You should get yourself a boat.

442
00:20:30,914 --> 00:20:32,914
I used to bring women on here.

443
00:20:33,925 --> 00:20:35,225
So many women.

444
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:36,860
No more.

445
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:39,677
The treatment's kinda put
a stop to that.

446
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,468
You said you wanted
to show me something.

447
00:20:41,551 --> 00:20:43,228
It's more peaceful though

448
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:45,398
without that constant need.

449
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:47,594
It's like I can finally think.

450
00:20:47,677 --> 00:20:49,080
I can clear my head.

451
00:20:50,241 --> 00:20:52,766
- I'm gonna go now.
- Okay, okay, it's under there.

452
00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:54,225
It's under there.

453
00:21:00,653 --> 00:21:02,253
What the hell is that?

454
00:21:02,336 --> 00:21:03,636
It's a scorpion.

455
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,360
Deep fried.

456
00:21:06,061 --> 00:21:07,511
I raised it myself.

457
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:09,615
What do you want me do with it?

458
00:21:09,698 --> 00:21:11,144
I want you to eat it.

459
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,941
Why would you want me to eat that?

460
00:21:13,024 --> 00:21:14,624
Because I want you to.

461
00:21:14,914 --> 00:21:16,302
Because you need to.

462
00:21:16,385 --> 00:21:19,241
Because you got all that money
and you don't have a boat.

463
00:21:19,324 --> 00:21:21,404
Because you're so angry.
And because if you eat it,

464
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:24,322
I will tell you everything
you want to know.

465
00:21:27,696 --> 00:21:28,703
Everything.

466
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,840
I took the stinger out.

467
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:16,445
I eat the scorpion and he dies.

468
00:22:18,855 --> 00:22:19,727
Got ya!

469
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,369
I looked good, didn't I?

470
00:22:24,452 --> 00:22:26,264
Like I really croaked?

471
00:22:26,347 --> 00:22:29,438
- I practiced that.
- I am going to go now.

472
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,850
Bank of Los Angeles.

473
00:22:38,434 --> 00:22:40,029
A deal is a deal.

474
00:22:40,394 --> 00:22:42,546
Yeah, we took that money.

475
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:44,637
And that was just the start.

476
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:48,072
We took a lot more
over the next few years.

477
00:22:48,155 --> 00:22:49,402
That was the plan...

478
00:22:49,485 --> 00:22:52,170
steal everything we
could get our hands on,

479
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:53,788
and then get out.

480
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:55,402
And Jack Reese?

481
00:22:55,485 --> 00:22:57,959
His crisis of faith came early.

482
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,903
Jack never kept a dime.

483
00:22:59,986 --> 00:23:01,145
Stayed a cop.

484
00:23:01,516 --> 00:23:03,432
Gave his cash to charity.

485
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:05,163
And Roman Nevikov?

486
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:09,561
- Why'd you want to have him put away?
- All that money we took,

487
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:11,706
we invested it.

488
00:23:12,614 --> 00:23:13,873
Roman Nevikov

489
00:23:14,357 --> 00:23:16,219
was one of our investments.

490
00:23:16,555 --> 00:23:18,938
But Roman Nevikov is a bad man.

491
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:21,419
Cops put bad men away,

492
00:23:21,502 --> 00:23:22,620
and we are cops.

493
00:23:22,703 --> 00:23:25,623
You're dying, and you want to polish
your tombstone before you go.

494
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:26,783
No,

495
00:23:26,866 --> 00:23:29,879
I'm dying, and I know
I'm going to hell when I do.

496
00:23:29,962 --> 00:23:32,744
But there is some justice
I need to get done first.

497
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,712
Sweet William is long gone.

498
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:42,622
- I'm just William now.
- You paid your debt, huh?

499
00:23:42,705 --> 00:23:45,407
I'm still paying it,
every single day.

500
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,092
And not because I have
to, because I want to.

501
00:23:48,175 --> 00:23:50,158
It makes me feel good to do good.

502
00:23:50,241 --> 00:23:51,646
So why the 180?

503
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,373
My mom straightened me out.

504
00:23:55,456 --> 00:23:57,310
She say you keep cutting
out people tongues,

505
00:23:57,393 --> 00:23:59,062
she'll send you to bed
with no supper?

506
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,709
No, she told me to make myself right
in the eyes of my maker.

507
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:03,939
So I want straight.

508
00:24:04,022 --> 00:24:07,186
- Everybody lives happily ever after.
- Yeah, except for Roy McCullough,

509
00:24:07,269 --> 00:24:08,946
in that he's not actually
living at all.

510
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,213
Just because some guy
rips off my mom,

511
00:24:11,296 --> 00:24:12,870
does that mean I kill him?

512
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:14,203
- Yes.
- Yeah.

513
00:24:15,295 --> 00:24:17,492
Sweet William would have killed him.

514
00:24:17,575 --> 00:24:19,992
- William Ford...
- turned the other cheek.

515
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:22,058
Yeah. You read that book?

516
00:24:22,141 --> 00:24:24,191
- I saw the movie.
- William,

517
00:24:24,274 --> 00:24:27,774
either of your cheeks have
an alibi for when he was killed?

518
00:24:28,031 --> 00:24:29,081
Detectives.

519
00:24:37,145 --> 00:24:39,045
They all say the same thing.

520
00:24:39,313 --> 00:24:42,061
They rode with William up to Oxnard
on the day before the killing,

521
00:24:42,144 --> 00:24:44,794
camped that night,
rode back the next day.

522
00:25:05,582 --> 00:25:06,582
To review,

523
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:09,049
Ian, Roy, and Sasha
see the old lady.

524
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,584
She's an easy mark.
They bleed her dry.

525
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:13,755
Mom file a complaint, but then...

526
00:25:13,838 --> 00:25:16,835
- Sweet William finds out about it.
- Mom un-file it, because in his world,

527
00:25:16,918 --> 00:25:18,737
they have their own way
of filing complaints.

528
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,829
William find Roy.
He wants his mother's money back.

529
00:25:20,912 --> 00:25:23,896
Roy resists for two seconds too long,
gets himself dead, then...

530
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:27,400
then they all work out the
story and alibi each other.

531
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,320
What?

532
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,815
No, you two are doing...
you'doing great.

533
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:35,190
- But?
- But, you know, if Sweet William

534
00:25:35,273 --> 00:25:38,070
shot Roy and then shoved
that money down his throat,

535
00:25:38,153 --> 00:25:41,485
why are Ian and Sasha
still working the roofing scam?

536
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,072
Look over this list and just initial
by all the changes that we made

537
00:25:45,155 --> 00:25:46,799
and make sure
that you're okay with it.

538
00:25:46,882 --> 00:25:48,606
And the total is
gonna be right here.

539
00:25:48,689 --> 00:25:49,489
Sasha.

540
00:25:50,646 --> 00:25:51,646
Detective.

541
00:25:52,922 --> 00:25:53,922
Excuse me.

542
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:57,740
Did you,

543
00:25:57,823 --> 00:26:01,347
- did you find who did that to Roy?
- Actually, I'm not here on business.

544
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:04,463
Well, I'm not here on my business, cop
business. I'm here on your business,

545
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:05,746
roof business.

546
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:07,373
I'd like to hire you.

547
00:26:07,456 --> 00:26:10,263
- Hire us?
- See, I like a lot light.

548
00:26:10,346 --> 00:26:12,586
A lot of light. And,

549
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:15,624
you know, I've just been thinking my...
my roof kindagets in the way of that,

550
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:16,625
the light.

551
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,935
So I was thinking if
I didn't have a roof,

552
00:26:19,018 --> 00:26:20,616
I could have more light.

553
00:26:20,699 --> 00:26:22,249
And I thought of you.

554
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:25,550
You're still in the business
of taking people's roofs, right?

555
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:27,710
Listen, I have to get back to work.

556
00:26:28,782 --> 00:26:31,721
We're pretty sure
William Ford killed Roy.

557
00:26:38,628 --> 00:26:40,478
Then you should arrest him.

558
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,270
If you think that he murdered Roy,

559
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:45,203
then you should arrest him.

560
00:26:45,515 --> 00:26:47,765
Why are you still working the scam?

561
00:26:49,027 --> 00:26:51,259
It's a legitimate business.

562
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:53,497
After what William did to Roy,

563
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,030
he took over your business,
didn't he?

564
00:26:56,651 --> 00:26:58,501
I have to get back to work.

565
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:01,042
After Roy was found dead,

566
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:02,901
William moved in on
you and Ian, didn't he?

567
00:27:02,984 --> 00:27:04,924
Ian and I own this business.

568
00:27:05,268 --> 00:27:06,097
Sasha,

569
00:27:06,939 --> 00:27:09,418
these men work for William Ford.

570
00:27:11,541 --> 00:27:13,471
Come with me right now.

571
00:27:14,393 --> 00:27:16,193
I can take care of myself.

572
00:27:29,596 --> 00:27:30,311
Ann,

573
00:27:31,354 --> 00:27:32,629
I understand

574
00:27:32,712 --> 00:27:35,650
how hurt you must be. And

575
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:37,772
if you need your

576
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:40,156
crew here to talk to me,

577
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:42,170
I understand that too.

578
00:27:42,253 --> 00:27:44,847
You can ask me anything you want
to know, anything at all.

579
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,290
I am wide open.

580
00:27:48,808 --> 00:27:51,258
I don't wanna know
anything about you.

581
00:27:52,317 --> 00:27:54,538
I don't understand.

582
00:27:54,621 --> 00:27:58,751
The purpose of this is an oral history
about my ancestors.

583
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:01,057
So you don't wanna
know anything about me,

584
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,972
what I've been doing?

585
00:28:03,455 --> 00:28:04,140
No.

586
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,779
Well, that's just...

587
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:08,019
silly.

588
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,022
My husband and I
designed this project...

589
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,254
your husband? Your husband?!

590
00:28:13,719 --> 00:28:15,469
When did you get married?

591
00:28:16,409 --> 00:28:17,659
Four years ago.

592
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,760
Where is he?

593
00:28:25,021 --> 00:28:26,303
Interviewing his mother.

594
00:28:26,386 --> 00:28:27,786
And where is that?

595
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,022
In Ulaan Baatar.

596
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:33,168
- Ulaan ba... what?
- Mongolia.

597
00:28:33,362 --> 00:28:35,745
My husband and I designed
this oral history project

598
00:28:35,828 --> 00:28:37,340
to start one generation back.

599
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:38,858
One generation...

600
00:28:39,915 --> 00:28:42,613
so you don't wanna know about me?

601
00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:43,787
No.

602
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,265
Okay, I understand that.

603
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,487
I understand that.

604
00:28:46,986 --> 00:28:49,386
Can I ask where you
met your husband?

605
00:28:49,576 --> 00:28:50,390
No.

606
00:28:51,017 --> 00:28:52,599
Can I ask if you have children?

607
00:28:52,682 --> 00:28:53,332
No.

608
00:28:54,174 --> 00:28:56,974
"No" I can't ask or
"no" you don't have them?

609
00:28:58,964 --> 00:29:00,614
So you're not gonna ask

610
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:04,549
anything about me,
and I can't ask anything about you?

611
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:07,112
Ann...

612
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,336
well, I-I...

613
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:15,002
I guess we're done here.

614
00:29:15,085 --> 00:29:15,926
Yeah.

615
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:17,787
Yeah, I guess we are.

616
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,114
Do not slam that door!

617
00:29:34,978 --> 00:29:37,142
If Ian and Sasha are
afraid of William,

618
00:29:37,225 --> 00:29:38,875
they're not gonna talk.

619
00:29:39,322 --> 00:29:43,162
And William's biker buddies and
his mother aren't gonna turn him in.

620
00:29:43,245 --> 00:29:45,495
So how do we break William's alibi?

621
00:29:47,068 --> 00:29:47,868
Reese?

622
00:29:49,116 --> 00:29:51,216
How do we break William's alibi?

623
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:55,225
Tidwell looks good in that suit.

624
00:29:55,308 --> 00:29:56,907
Oh, I'm just saying, you know,

625
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,340
it's a nice suit.

626
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,200
He looks good in it.

627
00:30:15,178 --> 00:30:16,478
Detective Crews.

628
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,930
That's right.

629
00:30:18,468 --> 00:30:19,912
Can we speak privately?

630
00:30:19,995 --> 00:30:21,026
And you are?

631
00:30:22,158 --> 00:30:24,620
Someone who'd like to
speak privately with you.

632
00:30:24,703 --> 00:30:25,653
Shall we?

633
00:30:42,482 --> 00:30:43,959
Amanda Puryer.

634
00:30:44,624 --> 00:30:46,045
Puryer security services.

635
00:30:46,128 --> 00:30:48,484
- Didn't think you were a cop.
- Can't see why you would.

636
00:30:48,567 --> 00:30:51,267
You're not recruiting, are you?
I'm pretty happy at my job.

637
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,227
No, I'm not recruiting.

638
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:55,569
I'm here about one of my clients,

639
00:30:55,652 --> 00:30:56,902
Mickey Rayborn.

640
00:30:57,404 --> 00:31:01,483
My company provides his security
package, protection, driving,

641
00:31:01,566 --> 00:31:02,799
intelligence

642
00:31:02,882 --> 00:31:04,232
around the clock.

643
00:31:04,478 --> 00:31:06,920
Is this about the driver
that I put in that trunk?

644
00:31:07,003 --> 00:31:08,050
No.

645
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:10,938
About the bodyguard I
left cuffed in the garage?

646
00:31:11,021 --> 00:31:11,671
No.

647
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,537
You can't smoke in here.

648
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,131
Why not?

649
00:31:24,653 --> 00:31:26,203
It's against the law.

650
00:31:27,201 --> 00:31:29,178
I don't believe that's true.

651
00:31:30,258 --> 00:31:31,447
I'm here

652
00:31:31,837 --> 00:31:33,155
about this.

653
00:31:39,947 --> 00:31:42,985
Coast guard found the boat
adrift about a mile out.

654
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,096
No body.

655
00:31:44,498 --> 00:31:46,048
But as you can see...

656
00:31:46,734 --> 00:31:48,034
plenty of blood.

657
00:31:48,504 --> 00:31:51,054
Your police lab is
typing the blood now.

658
00:31:51,614 --> 00:31:53,605
I'm sure they'll be
in touch with you soon.

659
00:31:53,688 --> 00:31:56,538
And I'm sure they'll
have their own questions.

660
00:31:57,201 --> 00:31:59,451
You were on that boat this morning.

661
00:32:03,781 --> 00:32:05,756
You're not I. a. P.
d. Why are you here?

662
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,953
Because if that blood is
Rayborn's, if he's dead,

663
00:32:08,036 --> 00:32:11,724
my company owes his
estate $15 million.

664
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,287
Because if that blood's Rayborn's,

665
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,120
someone killed my client.

666
00:32:17,831 --> 00:32:19,481
And I think it was you.

667
00:32:24,267 --> 00:32:25,776
You can't smoke in here.

668
00:32:49,618 --> 00:32:51,318
Was she smoking in here?

669
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,770
Now that's a woman...

670
00:32:55,138 --> 00:32:57,544
who needs to take better
care of her health,

671
00:32:57,627 --> 00:32:59,179
much better care.

672
00:32:59,422 --> 00:33:00,352
Crews,

673
00:33:00,903 --> 00:33:02,841
your head in there or in there?

674
00:33:02,924 --> 00:33:04,565
- There.
- All right,

675
00:33:05,975 --> 00:33:08,202
here's what we know
about William Ford.

676
00:33:08,285 --> 00:33:10,769
He makes it a habit of taking over
people's businesses.

677
00:33:10,852 --> 00:33:14,300
He also makes it a habit of leaving
his mark on his victims.

678
00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:16,782
One has his tongue cut out.
One has his fingers broken.

679
00:33:16,865 --> 00:33:18,910
And one of them was blinded.

680
00:33:19,146 --> 00:33:22,596
- No one on this board was blinded.
- No, no one on that board.

681
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:25,429
William Ford takes over
people's businesses.

682
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:28,496
How do you think
he got into antiques?

683
00:33:37,675 --> 00:33:39,203
Detective girlie.

684
00:33:40,133 --> 00:33:41,358
And Mr. Apple.

685
00:33:41,805 --> 00:33:42,984
Wayne Hall.

686
00:33:43,825 --> 00:33:45,217
How'd you know my name?

687
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,857
I never told you my name.

688
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,625
We know a lot of
things about you, Wayne.

689
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,809
We know you did time for
possession and dealing.

690
00:33:51,892 --> 00:33:53,623
We know you walk around
that antique store

691
00:33:53,706 --> 00:33:55,389
like you used to own the place,

692
00:33:55,472 --> 00:33:57,849
- like it was yours.
- I just work there.

693
00:33:57,932 --> 00:33:59,616
That shop belongs to William Ford.

694
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:02,417
Yeah, you know, we saw
that in the title records.

695
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,582
You signed it over.

696
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,963
We know something
else about you, Wayne.

697
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:07,746
You were not born blind.

698
00:34:08,885 --> 00:34:11,485
What happened, you
piss off William Ford?

699
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:13,008
He take your store?

700
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:14,824
Then took your sight?

701
00:34:14,907 --> 00:34:17,424
What'd you do, you steal money?

702
00:34:18,118 --> 00:34:19,418
You steal drugs?

703
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,649
You stole drugs.

704
00:34:23,732 --> 00:34:25,782
That was your store, wasn't it?

705
00:34:26,761 --> 00:34:28,489
That was a long time ago.

706
00:34:28,825 --> 00:34:31,417
- Do you want it back?
- How's that gonna happen?

707
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,143
Well, we don't think William took
your store because he likes antiques.

708
00:34:35,226 --> 00:34:37,226
He could care less about them.

709
00:34:38,072 --> 00:34:40,272
So what's he really selling there?

710
00:34:43,871 --> 00:34:45,671
Hey, whatever you tell us,

711
00:34:46,945 --> 00:34:48,127
we were never here.

712
00:34:49,499 --> 00:34:50,796
I never saw you?

713
00:34:56,271 --> 00:34:57,222
China

714
00:34:57,813 --> 00:34:58,512
clock.

715
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:06,562
How may I help you?

716
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:09,749
- China clock.
- We'll take that one.

717
00:35:10,753 --> 00:35:12,987
- That one there.
- It's not for sale.

718
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,396
It's a personal favorite.

719
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:18,552
You strike me, you'll
only be striking yourself.

720
00:35:18,635 --> 00:35:20,647
What, some kind of karmic payback?

721
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:21,706
If only.

722
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:24,621
No, my partner will just
shoot you in the head.

723
00:35:28,411 --> 00:35:29,276
Reese,

724
00:35:29,846 --> 00:35:32,196
you ever seen a clock made of china?

725
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:34,540
You have to be

726
00:35:34,623 --> 00:35:36,423
really careful with china.

727
00:35:37,149 --> 00:35:38,222
Fragile.

728
00:35:42,921 --> 00:35:45,069
Oh, and there was china in it too.

729
00:35:45,152 --> 00:35:47,961
Oh, that dope also
a personal favorite?

730
00:35:48,227 --> 00:35:50,060
Say good-bye to the world, William.

731
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:53,025
Record like yours and dope
like that, that's 15 to 20 easy.

732
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:55,510
If you can pin that dope to me.

733
00:35:55,593 --> 00:35:57,511
Everything in here came
from somewhere else.

734
00:35:57,672 --> 00:35:59,317
I don't know where
that clock has been.

735
00:35:59,527 --> 00:36:01,768
Maybe you can handle
another stretch.

736
00:36:01,851 --> 00:36:04,049
What about your mom?
Can she?

737
00:36:04,132 --> 00:36:05,262
My mom?

738
00:36:05,345 --> 00:36:07,611
She gave away her life
savings with you outside.

739
00:36:07,694 --> 00:36:10,314
How safe is she gonna
be with you inside?

740
00:36:10,397 --> 00:36:11,215
Okay,

741
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,678
let's do some business then.

742
00:36:13,761 --> 00:36:15,280
I got something you want.

743
00:36:15,363 --> 00:36:16,840
Yeah, what's that?

744
00:36:19,724 --> 00:36:22,520
The murder weapon from that killing.

745
00:36:23,986 --> 00:36:26,236
The gun in the McCullough shooting?

746
00:36:27,726 --> 00:36:29,770
With Ian Ryker's prints on it.

747
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,580
Insurance policy?

748
00:36:32,663 --> 00:36:34,687
Yeah, it's my insurance.

749
00:36:35,545 --> 00:36:36,895
One little thing.

750
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,330
- Yeah, what?
- This is a. 45.

751
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:42,169
Roy was killed with a. 38.

752
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:43,607
Now

753
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,290
what exactly did you mean
by "insurance"?

754
00:36:53,807 --> 00:36:56,118
You know what this is?
This is the gun that you gave to us,

755
00:36:56,201 --> 00:36:57,755
but that is not the murder weapon.

756
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:00,111
That was a. 38. This is a. 45.

757
00:37:00,533 --> 00:37:03,390
There are fingerprints on this gun,
and those prints are Ian's.

758
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:06,569
- So do you know what this is?
- You already asked him that.

759
00:37:06,652 --> 00:37:07,452
Right.

760
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,540
This is not the gun that killed Roy.

761
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:13,031
William,

762
00:37:13,114 --> 00:37:16,186
why did you think Ian killed Roy
with a gun that didn't kill Roy?

763
00:37:16,269 --> 00:37:18,318
And why would Ian touch the
gun that didn't kill Roy?

764
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,960
And here's the big one...
why do you have the gun

765
00:37:21,043 --> 00:37:23,493
that Ian touched
that didn't kill Roy?

766
00:37:24,938 --> 00:37:26,201
William,

767
00:37:26,284 --> 00:37:28,022
Ian gave you that gun.

768
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:31,231
He tried to give me barbequed ribs.

769
00:37:31,517 --> 00:37:34,167
They looked kinda moist too.
Not too saucy.

770
00:37:34,985 --> 00:37:36,577
It's what Ian does.

771
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,275
He wants to sell you something,

772
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:40,418
he gives something away. So

773
00:37:40,501 --> 00:37:42,441
if he gave you that gun,

774
00:37:43,031 --> 00:37:44,731
what did he sell to you?

775
00:37:46,536 --> 00:37:47,347
Okay.

776
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,465
Those kids take
everything your mom has.

777
00:37:49,548 --> 00:37:52,397
You get mad. You get your hand
around Ian's throat.

778
00:37:52,999 --> 00:37:55,839
- So what does Ian do?
- He sells you something?

779
00:37:55,922 --> 00:37:57,866
Don't be ashamed.
He's good at his job.

780
00:37:57,949 --> 00:38:00,323
You wanted one of them dead
for what they did to your mom.

781
00:38:00,406 --> 00:38:01,570
Ian saw that.

782
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,583
That's why he's good at his job.

783
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:06,941
- He knows what people want.
- Ian gave you what you wanted.

784
00:38:07,024 --> 00:38:10,329
Did he tell you that if you'd let
him go, he'd take care of Roy?

785
00:38:10,412 --> 00:38:12,412
And then he gave you that gun.

786
00:38:12,765 --> 00:38:14,965
Told me to dust it for his prints.

787
00:38:16,413 --> 00:38:17,613
For insurance?

788
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:20,915
Yeah. There's still
the problem with that

789
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,465
one little thing.

790
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:26,319
That is not the gun that killed Roy.

791
00:38:27,187 --> 00:38:28,424
So...

792
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:30,599
then I didn't do anything wrong?

793
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:33,819
Except for felony possession
and aggravated extortion.

794
00:38:33,902 --> 00:38:34,996
Oh, yeah.

795
00:38:37,306 --> 00:38:39,556
So where's the gun that killed Roy?

796
00:38:44,228 --> 00:38:47,178
Sasha said she knew how
to take care of herself.

797
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,047
Offer me some chicken.

798
00:39:00,898 --> 00:39:01,721
What?

799
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,814
Offer me some chicken.

800
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,287
- You want some chicken?
- No.

801
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,020
Now offer me some ribs.

802
00:39:09,623 --> 00:39:11,569
- You want me to offer you...
- some ribs.

803
00:39:12,355 --> 00:39:15,104
Come on, you can do it.
Ribs first, then business.

804
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,001
- Do you want some ribs?
- No.

805
00:39:18,084 --> 00:39:19,409
I thought you wanted me to offer{\ you some}...

806
00:39:19,492 --> 00:39:21,062
- now offer me a gun.
- A what?

807
00:39:21,145 --> 00:39:23,235
- Offer him a gun.
- I told you, I don't have a gun.

808
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:25,362
Okay, well,
just offer him one anyway.

809
00:39:25,445 --> 00:39:27,812
What did you mean when you said
you could take care of yourself?

810
00:39:27,895 --> 00:39:30,479
Did Ian give you something
so you could take care of yourself?

811
00:39:30,562 --> 00:39:33,537
Did Ian give you a gun so you
could take care of yourself?

812
00:39:36,935 --> 00:39:39,820
After William killed Roy, after

813
00:39:39,903 --> 00:39:41,538
those men took over,

814
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:43,779
Ian gave me a gun,

815
00:39:43,862 --> 00:39:45,215
for my protection.

816
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,182
I have no idea what
she's talking about.

817
00:39:47,265 --> 00:39:49,553
It's okay. You did it to protect me.

818
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,305
No, no, no, don't...
don't touch that.

819
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,217
I'm not gonna do anything.

820
00:39:55,254 --> 00:39:57,269
Except get your prints on it.

821
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:58,273
A.38.

822
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,100
Just like the gun that
put that bullet into Roy.

823
00:40:01,183 --> 00:40:02,566
I never knew she had that gun.

824
00:40:02,649 --> 00:40:04,317
Yes, you did. You gave it to me.

825
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,457
No, I didn't. And I never touched it.
You won't find my prints on it.

826
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,063
Oh, just Sasha's?

827
00:40:09,146 --> 00:40:11,503
Well, you really are
good at your job.

828
00:40:11,586 --> 00:40:13,577
After you talked William
out of killing you...

829
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,901
and then you set William up by shoving
that money down Roy's throat.

830
00:40:16,984 --> 00:40:19,084
Is that the gun that killed Roy?

831
00:40:20,409 --> 00:40:22,018
You gave me

832
00:40:22,101 --> 00:40:23,295
the gun that killed Roy?

833
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:25,896
I don't know what you're
talking about, Sasha.

834
00:40:26,365 --> 00:40:27,782
I want to arrange for her a lawyer

835
00:40:27,865 --> 00:40:29,335
so she doesn't get one of those
appointed ones.

836
00:40:29,418 --> 00:40:30,939
Who do I talk to about that?

837
00:40:31,022 --> 00:40:33,221
You ever kill anyone
before you killed Roy?

838
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,971
- I never killed Roy.
- Take a life.

839
00:40:36,316 --> 00:40:38,148
You think you're ready
for it but you're not.

840
00:40:38,231 --> 00:40:41,781
- I didn't kill anyone.
- It makes your whole world go away.

841
00:40:42,852 --> 00:40:44,802
Makes you forget who you are,

842
00:40:45,827 --> 00:40:47,110
who you want to be.

843
00:40:49,311 --> 00:40:51,711
Makes you forget
where you came from,

844
00:40:51,963 --> 00:40:53,613
and where you're going.

845
00:40:55,303 --> 00:40:57,453
Makes you forget a lot of things.

846
00:41:00,387 --> 00:41:02,137
You only used one bullet.

847
00:41:04,342 --> 00:41:06,542
You remember to wipe down the gun.

848
00:41:08,404 --> 00:41:10,804
Did you remember to
wipe the bullets?

849
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:30,169
We gonna find your prints on those?

850
00:41:44,498 --> 00:41:46,336
I told you kids stole that roof.
