2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,340
if yesterday was thanksgiving and
today is christmas, what's tomorrow?

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,460
Saturday.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,940
Are we going to exchange gifts?

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,620
You know, christmas gifts?

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,590
Some small token of partnership?

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,950
I'll check in again with
you closer to the big day.

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,840
How was your thanksgiving?

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,730
My dad's still gone, my mom got
drunk, and I did the dishes. You?

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,780
Ted made some kind of bird.

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,420
It was either a very large
chicken or a very small turkey.

12
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,750
Maybe a baby turkey.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,280
Do they sell those? Baby turkeys?

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,980
It tasted like chicken though.

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,380
Fell from up there someplace.

16
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,740
Yeah, but fell slipped,
fell pushed, or fell jumped?

17
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,610
Neck snapped. Died instantly.

18
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,170
What do you say? You're the first
jumper of the holiday season?

19
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,740
Sorry. Sorry.

20
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:14,460
Got me a solid column of the wife's stuffing and
gravy starts at my neck runs straight down to my...

21
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,900
well, straight down.

22
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,930
First jumper of the season?

23
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,410
It seems a little early,
but you never know.

24
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,740
You get an id on him?

25
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,790
Head of mall security.

26
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,420
Dave, these are
detectives crews and reese.

27
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,280
Harris, dave.

28
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,480
Head of security.

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,800
Crime scene's all battened down.

30
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,090
Good to know that, dave.

31
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,330
Do you know this man?

32
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,960
Sure. Mitchell clark. He
worked up on the second level.

33
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,790
Doesn't seem that far to fall.

34
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,690
Not from down here it doesn'T.

35
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,100
How well did you know mr. Clark?

36
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,090
I saw him around.

37
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,920
You know, i try to familiarize
myself with all the employees.

38
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,660
For security reasons.

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,410
He seem depressed?

40
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,840
That I wouldn't know.

41
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,690
Do you think he killed himself?

42
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,550
Oh, I hope he didn't kill himself.

43
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,450
Well, if he didn't kill himself,
then someone probably pushed him.

44
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,990
You mean killed him?

45
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,530
The world coming to an end?

46
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,730
Kind of. It's 6:00
A.M. The mall's opening.

47
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,930
The mall's opening?

48
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,080
I thought you said you'd
secured the crime scene.

49
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,560
Well, I put out this yellow tape,
but you think I closed the mall?

50
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,510
I can't close the
mall. I just work here.

51
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,420
Anyway, it's black friday.

52
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,580
Biggest shopping day of the year?

53
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,370
Hold up! Wait! Wait!

54
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,480
wait, wait, wait! Hey,
hey, hey! No, no, no!

55
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:38,360
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

56
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,540
The crime scene!

57
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,470
Crime scene.

58
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,380
The body's gone?

59
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,570
The body's gone.

60
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,980
It's a miracle.

61
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,690
A genuine miracle.

64
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,760
You know, I lost a
girlfriend at a mall once,

65
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,290
but it was to the guy who can
stand motionless for hours.

66
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,430
So, you know, they had that in common.

67
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,880
But a body, a dead
body-- wait a minute.

68
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,160
Could it be a christmas miracle?

69
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,320
If someone took the body,
they took it for a reason.

70
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,450
Perhaps it's all the
"everything must go" signs.

71
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,570
Probably not.

72
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,770
If someone took
a body like that--

73
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,420
maybe it was gonna tell us something.

74
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,590
It did tell us something.

75
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,810
It wasn't a suicide.

76
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,450
The killer took the body.

77
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,310
All right, k9, you find the body.

78
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,540
You find the killer, and I'm going to
everything-on-a-stick to find some breakfast.

79
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,950
Where were you last night?

80
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,270
Isn't that the kind of
question you ask a suspect?

81
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,540
I was at my sister'S.

82
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,550
It was thanksgiving.

83
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,870
And you were there all night?

84
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,110
She lives in ojai. I slept over.

85
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,480
You can ask her. Or the
little brat whose room I took.

86
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,900
Came in this morning and
sat on my head, full diaper.

87
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,270
Thanksgiving.

88
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,240
Mitchell was scheduled
to open for me today.

89
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,000
He's always so punctual, I
thought something was wrong.

90
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,970
We need to know where
you were last night.

91
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,550
It was thanksgiving. I was
with my family. Wasn't everyone?

92
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,560
We need the phone number
for the victim's next of kin.

93
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,570
He didn't list anything.

94
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,390
He split with his wife
a couple of years ago.

95
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,730
She moved back to minneapolis or
one of those states back there.

96
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,500
There's a rumor that you all lost
his body, but I just say that's silly.

97
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,320
You're right. That is silly.

98
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,630
Was mitchell having trouble with
anyone at work or in the mall?

99
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,290
He never said anything.

100
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,380
Did he have friends here?

101
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:10,680
Well, he didn't think I knew, but I think
he was dating erika from the hat kiosk.

102
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,910
She's way too young for him.

103
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,230
You can't miss her.

104
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,350
She dresses like a tramp.

105
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,930
Try lost and found on level two.

106
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,030
Heard you're looking for a body.

107
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,900
That's a strange reaction.

108
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,900
Yeah? Why's that?

109
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,580
Because we heard you were
dating mitchell clark.

110
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,190
Dating the shoe store
guy? Who said that?

111
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,810
His manager at sole fix.

112
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,980
Oh, her.

113
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,570
She's just jealous
because guys ask about me.

114
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,060
I mean, look at her. Look at me.

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,760
Where were you last night?

116
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,120
I was off. It was thanksgiving.

117
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,910
Ate some turkey with the family?

118
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,360
Kind of.

119
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,200
Clay and I went to the pocket
stop for pot pies and rock-it fuel.

120
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,630
Didn't see mitchell clark?

121
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,850
I said no.

122
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,950
I'm sure he's got friends his own age.

123
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,050
You should ask him when you find him.

124
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,920
I have to get back to work.

125
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,020
Is this store all key chains?

126
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,280
They're called fobs.

127
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,780
Fobs? Just fobs?

128
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,790
Do you get a lot of repeat business?

129
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,400
Clay, did you know mitchell
clark from the shoe store?

130
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,640
No. I hearysyou gu lost the body.

131
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,740
Oh, you heard that, huh?

132
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,170
If there's no body, how
do you know someone's dead?

133
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,670
We have a test. It's
called the dead test.

134
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,250
Mitchell clark passed.

135
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,140
Oh, dude, I'd hate to take that test.

136
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,180
Clay, do you want some potato chips?

137
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,840
Why would I want potato chips?

138
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:48,270
Oh, it just seems
like yht mig like some.

139
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,640
Do you know erika over there?

140
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,550
Yeah, yeah.

141
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,260
Was she dating mitchell clark?

142
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:58,970
The shoe store guy? No. No, I
mean, look at her. Look at him.

143
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,830
Well, look at him when you find him.

144
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,740
Who works over there?

145
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,670
- I don't know.
- Come on. Thanks.

146
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,180
Who doesn't come to work on the
busiest shopping day of the year?

147
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,870
<i>HAVE QUESTIONS?CALL ZAK SUTTER...</i>

148
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,640
Is this zak?

149
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,930
It's detective crews, the lapd.

150
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,280
Yeah, we saw you weren't at work.

151
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,870
We saw the sign and called you.

152
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:40,030
We have some questions
we'd like to ask you.

153
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,300
He says he's sick. Won't
be here until tomorrow.

154
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,090
Hey, hang on. Hang on a
minute. You're cutting out.

155
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,850
I see. Okay.

156
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,570
That was mall music.

157
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,790
He's in the mall.

158
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,260
Hey, you don't know the guy
who works five feet from you?

159
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,660
No, man, sorry.

160
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,710
Kiosk people kind of come and go.

161
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,210
Don't know him.

162
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,470
You lose him too?

163
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,190
He's here someplace.

164
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,640
Yeah, but it's the seventh
largest mall in the world.

165
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,450
I heard it was the fifth.

166
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,110
Can you show me how you do that
thing when you block the caller I.D.?

167
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,720
Your dad still gone?

168
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,410
Yep.

169
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,160
Maybe he'll come back.

170
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,800
Or maybe he won't, and then I'll
finally get what I want for christmas.

171
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,820
Zak sutter.

172
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,500
I'd say so.

173
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,590
I guess he didn't see the sign.

174
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,840
Guess he didn't see that one either.

175
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,990
Good place to hide a body down here.

176
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,550
Okay, okay. Who are you?

177
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,050
I'm detective crews.

178
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,430
I spoke to you on the phone, zak.

179
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,610
anything here you want to show us?

180
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,980
no. No, no, no--wait,
wait, wait! Don't open that!

181
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,750
Using that photo with Jack Reese,
you want to go see Mickey rayborn?

182
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,270
Mickey rayborn.

183
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,740
mickey rayborn!

184
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,760
Let me tell you something.

185
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:46,510
When I grew up, the idea that the mayor
of los angeles would call me his friend

186
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,960
was not something a kid
like me would dream about.

187
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,340
But I've been lucky here.

188
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,330
Lucky to have been a police
officer for the city of los angeles.

189
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,120
How does an ex-cop
get that kind of money?

190
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,510
Maybe he worked for it.

191
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,620
And holds land all over
the city, three hotels,

192
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:09,020
owns a big piece of that
development going up in the marina.

193
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,800
Owns the arena fighting franchise.

194
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,060
We should go to a match.

195
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,830
and now if somebody will just
give me a shovel, I'll show you.

196
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,540
Charlie, isn't that your ex-wife?

197
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,290
What is she doing here?

198
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,760
I don't know.

199
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,070
Well, maybe we should go.

200
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,370
Charlie--

201
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,060
charlie.

202
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,030
What are you doing here?

203
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,100
It was ted's idea.

204
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,620
Something about a tax
deduction. What about you?

205
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,290
Me? Oh, you can't imagine how many
of these things we have to go to.

206
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,050
We?

207
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,610
My husband.

208
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,870
He's around here somewhere on a call.

209
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,160
I got a car. It has a back seat.

210
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,770
It got-- it
got shot up.

211
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,130
I mean, I shot it up, but,
you know, it still drives.

212
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,110
What do you want, charlie?

213
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,680
What do you want to do?

214
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,860
I want to go back.

215
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,240
Back where?

216
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,340
There.

217
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,720
I want to go back there.

218
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:35,720
Yeah. But we can't go back.

219
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:42,210
- Because we're here now.
- Yes.

220
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,490
I know. We're here now.

221
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,450
Charlie, I have to find my husband.

222
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,130
Agent bodner?

223
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,600
We need to talk, but not here.

224
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,480
Fbi?

225
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,520
Max sutter. Jeanette sutter.

226
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,380
Your father died of
cancer, october 2007.

227
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:36,430
Your mother in a car
accident a month later.

228
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,730
You and carin were supposed
to enter foster care.

229
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,190
They don't know us.

230
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,820
You can't become carin's
legal guardian until you're 21.

231
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,810
You plan to live in the
mall for the next four years?

232
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,100
I have a job there.

233
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,220
I can take care of her.

234
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,920
- Zak, did you know mitchell clark?
- No.

235
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,530
I heard you lost the body though.

236
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,750
Bet your boss is pretty mad about that.

237
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,870
When the mall closed down last night, did
you hear anything unusual or see anything?

238
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,550
When we're in our room,
we stay in our room.

239
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,260
Really? You have the mall
to yourselves. I'd go out.

240
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,230
Well, that's you.

241
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,310
When can I talk to my sister?

242
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,840
How long have you and your
brother been living at the mall?

243
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,080
Since your mom died?

244
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,080
Yeah.

245
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:38,280
Carin, you know you can't
live at a mall, don't you?

246
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,120
I have zak.

247
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,520
He's a good brother.

248
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,600
What about my things?

249
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,490
Your things are at the mall, and
we'll have them brought to you.

250
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,810
Brought to me?

251
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,530
Why? Where am I going?

252
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,490
I want to go home.

253
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,990
what's it like, living in the mall?

254
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:13,650
Well, it's the second largest mall in the
world, so, you know, a dream come true.

255
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:18,420
Zak, what's it like living in the mall?

256
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:25,020
Well, it's the second largest mall in the
world, so, you know, a dream come true.

257
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,710
Yeah.

258
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:31,500
Okay, zak, you know the
state's gonna want to hold you.

259
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,540
Because we're minors.

260
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,920
Because you're minors.
Because you were trespassing.

261
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,720
And, zak, because a man died.

262
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,920
So we might need to talk to you again.

263
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,930
When can I see my sister?

264
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:48,530
I'll call children's
services to take custody.

265
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,320
They're children. I have
to call children's services.

266
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,960
They wanted to split them up.

267
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,300
Who wanted to split what up?

268
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,400
Those kids.

269
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,260
Children's services
would have separated them.

270
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,660
After their parents died, they ran.

271
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,310
All they've got is each other.

272
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,600
I still have to call them.

273
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:07,230
Unless someone wants to ask
me to do them a personal favor.

274
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,870
All right. I'll see if I can find
somebody to track down a relative.

275
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,030
While they wait here.

276
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:23,230
Detective reese-- are
we still on for dinner?

277
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,150
Only if you never say it out loud again.

278
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:36,500
Tidwell.

279
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,490
they were living in a mall.

280
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,960
For almost a year.

281
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,080
Lived right here, in a mall.

282
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,500
He was taking care of his sister.

283
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,510
You know, not a lot
of kids would do that.

284
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,590
Yeah, but if two kids have been living
here unnoticed, what else is going on?

285
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,960
Let's split up.

286
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:17,040
Crews? Did you go shopping?

287
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,450
It's black friday, reese.

288
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,010
Everything's on sale.

289
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,160
Man, my dogs are tired.

290
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,360
I thought we were supposed to find
out what else was going on here.

291
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,900
Oh, I found out a lot of things.

292
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:28,710
I found out you really can't get
everything at everything-on-a-stick.

293
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,850
You can get papaya, which some
people think tastes like barf.

294
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,820
I don'T.

295
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:39,900
Oh, the girl at the bubbles told me
you shouldn't wash your face with soap.

296
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,090
Did you know that?

297
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,650
All my life I've washed
my face with soap.

298
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,250
The guy in the bookstore, he told me that
in four days I could learn to speak dutch.

299
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,880
Four days, reese.

300
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,530
By tuesday, what I'm saying to you
now, I could say to you in dutch.

301
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:58,410
Oh, the woman at opticals told me
that with the shape of face you have,

302
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,270
you should be wearing these frames.

303
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,820
Put them on.

304
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,520
How does she know the shape of my face?

305
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,370
I described you.

306
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,290
By tuesday, I could describe
you in dutch. Put them on.

307
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,460
She was right. They do look good.

308
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,660
You're what they call a "pinched ovoid".

309
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,790
Don't take it personally.
Did you get me anything?

310
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,730
Crews.

311
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,290
The girl at lola's,
she told me--

312
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,520
I don't think I want to know this.

313
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,980
No, you do.

314
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:41,500
The girl at lola's told me that the dead
shoe store guy and the hat kiosk girl

315
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,260
are in there a lot, together.

316
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,350
Together together?

317
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,740
Together together.

318
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,710
So clay and erika lied to
us about knowing mitchell.

319
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,880
Let's go to the kiosks.

320
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,260
No, they're working at the gift
wrap hut. I saw them there today.

321
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,710
Do you want these?

322
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,600
They have a patented
breathability patch. Microfibers.

323
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,980
I can't return them. You
can't return underwear.

324
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,510
It's about time.

325
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,850
These things are heavy.

326
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,510
Just get in the back. These
people need their presents wrapped.

327
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,080
Charlie?

328
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,040
he says they're
fighting about fruitcake.

329
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,950
There's no fight about fruitcake.
Everyone hates fruitcake.

330
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,890
It's fruit and it's
cake. What's not to like?

331
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,090
That it's the heaviest
substance known to man?

332
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,520
What did you just say?

333
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,680
That I hate it?

334
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,460
No, the other thing.

335
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,500
If I gave you one of these, would you
wrap it up and give me back an x-box?

336
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:08,430
Because we think people are giving you
x-boxes, and you're handing them back fruitcake.

337
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,000
Now what kind of holiday spirit is that?

338
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,820
bad elf.

339
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,590
Hi, charlie.

340
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,150
Hi, jen.

341
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,860
This place looks exactly the same.

342
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,480
Exactly. Right?

343
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,350
Remember the night
your dad caught us here?

344
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,950
I remember how nervous you were
the first time we checked in.

345
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,300
No, I wasn't nervous.

346
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,450
Yes, you were.

347
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,260
I was too.

348
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,570
Jen...

349
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,520
I thought you said we couldn't go back.

350
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,780
We can go back tonight.

351
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,500
Who did this to us, charlie?

352
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,770
I don't know.

353
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,990
But you're gonna find them?

354
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,060
Yeah.

355
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,980
I loved you, charlie.

356
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:55,290
So much.

357
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,890
I loved you too, jen.

358
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:21,700
The fruitcake gag, you think it up?

359
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:26,950
Kid wakes up christmas morning,
opens up a box of delicious fruitcake.

360
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,720
Who wouldn't like that?

361
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,460
That's a lot of fruitcake.

362
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,540
you don't want to go down
for the full freight on this.

363
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,420
- Full freight?
- Homicide.

364
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,970
You mean murder?

365
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,050
That's what it means.

366
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,240
For mitchell clark's murder?

367
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,380
You're trying to trick me.

368
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,800
Well, mitchell's alive.
I know that for a fact.

369
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,470
How do you know that, clay?

370
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,410
Oh, look at all this stolen merchandise
we found at your apartment, erika.

371
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:59,240
My partner and I, we
work robbery/homicide.

372
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:04,260
But there's a little play in the robbery
charge, as long as it helps us solve a homicide.

373
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,460
There is no homicide.

374
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,320
Mitchell isn't dead.

375
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,250
He is.

376
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:14,110
You had a relationship with him
you don't want to talk about.

377
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,330
This is all about hurting mitchell.

378
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,340
That won't happen.

379
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:23,430
Mitchell cares about us.

380
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,910
You don't care about us.

381
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:33,420
Maybe he cared about you,
erika, but not anymore.

382
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:37,690
Mitchell clark is alive.

383
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,220
they swear he's not dead.

384
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,720
This is why we like to have
a body in these situations.

385
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,500
It helps keep things simple.

386
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,010
Are you liking that?

387
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:55,490
There is a distinct possibility
that this isn't fruit or cake.

388
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,610
They mean it when
they say he's not dead.

389
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,790
But he is dead.

390
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,190
Yeah, he is.

391
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,370
But they mean it when
they say he's not dead.

392
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:08,970
So... he's risen? He's elvis?

393
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,300
What?

394
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,970
Don't you "what" me.

395
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,620
The kids. Where's zak and carin?

396
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,680
It's been a full day.

397
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,950
Detective, a police station
is no place for kids.

398
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,340
Back me up on this, crews.

399
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,730
I'm gonna be switzerland here.

400
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,800
They had nazi gold.

401
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,300
You sent them to children's services.

402
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,340
I couldn't find a relative.

403
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,580
There wasn't anybody who wants them.

404
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,060
Detective, they are children.

405
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,850
Children's services are
where they need to be.

406
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,660
Now, I've got two thieves in there.

407
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,860
And from all that swag, it looks like
they've been at it for quite a while.

408
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:44,060
And a good guess is that the dead guy who
they lied about not knowing was a thief too.

409
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:48,290
So I'm waiting for you two
to tell me who killed him.

410
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:55,280
Fruitcake?

411
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,550
Reese, come on.

412
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,750
How would you get rid of me?

413
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,690
Tidwell said find the
killer, not the body.

414
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,440
You do everything tidwell says?

415
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,560
The question isn't who killed him.

416
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,680
It is if you're homicide
cops, which we are.

417
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,910
No, the question is why do
they think he's not dead?

418
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,920
Come on, it's weird, right?

419
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,370
To think he's not dead?

420
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,840
You're scaring the children.

421
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,690
Reese, come on.

422
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,550
How would you get rid of my body?

423
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,860
Would you put me in one of
these big boxes like a present?

424
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:28,760
They've been searched.

425
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,380
Would you cut me up into tiny pieces?

426
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,130
No blood, no knife, no time.

427
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:38,140
Would you drag me across the parking
lot and put me in the trunk of your car?

428
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,670
That's a long way to go with a body.

429
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,650
You know, if I want to get rid of
you, I'd put you in the nearest store.

430
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,550
But the cadaver dogs have been through
the mall and didn't find anything.

431
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:53,640
Maybe they didn't find anything
'cause there's too much there.

432
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,000
You like goldfish?

433
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,430
No. What did you find out?

434
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,630
K9 didn't bring the dogs into here.

435
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,510
Said there's too much
animal scent to get a hit.

436
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,010
The uniforms have
scheduled a visual search.

437
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,480
They haven't done it yet?

438
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:48,540
Hey, reese, ever had a bunny?

439
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,970
Cedar chips in the cage.

440
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,960
Smells like a walk in the woods.

441
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,570
Mitchell clark, there you are.

442
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:20,130
Yeah, but who put him there?

443
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,820
black friday we did not open at 6 A.M.

444
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,100
What time did you open?

445
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,200
9:30. Regular hours.

446
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:32,380
No one wants a lizard at 6 A.M. No one.

447
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,540
And where were you?

448
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:36,010
Thanksgiving, I was with my family.

449
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,440
Isn't everyone?

450
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,230
Who has access to the store?

451
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,870
The owner, in tahiti.

452
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,060
My partner, in rehab.

453
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,140
Security.

454
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,630
- Security.
- Dave.

455
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:55,600
What do you want for christmas? What do you mean
you don't know? How can you not know? Come on.

456
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,480
Moonlighting?

457
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:00,340
Oh, I do this every year.

458
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,780
I like to spread a little cheer.

459
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:05,870
Now, you'll have to wait your turn
like good boys and girls, detectives.

460
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,780
Hey, santa, guess what?

461
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,770
We just got an early christmas present.

462
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,490
Oh, what's that?

463
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,870
Mitchell clark's body.

464
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,170
In the cedar chips,
back of paws and claws.

465
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,990
Well, I'd imagine that'd be a
big help to your investigation.

466
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,920
It is.

467
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:28,530
Yeah, see, the store was closed,
but guess who had the access code?

468
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:34,710
As the head of security, I can assure you
that 18 people have access to that store.

469
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,320
Come on, son.

470
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:42,240
And we've already established where I
was when mitchell went off that balcony.

471
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:46,230
And of course, I was with
you when he went missing.

472
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,050
This isn't--
is this real?

473
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,810
It's real.

474
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,790
But he was here. You had him.

475
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,090
Who told you that?

476
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,060
Erika, who told you
mitchell was still alive?

477
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,560
- That we had him?
- Was it dave?

478
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,190
were you stealing from mitchell?

479
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,140
We all were.

480
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,990
Then, friday morning, mitchell was gone.

481
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,510
Dave said you had him.

482
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,820
That if we did what he said, mitchell
would get out and come back to us.

483
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,240
So we did what dave said. I...

484
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,540
I did what dave said.

485
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,520
You want to tell us about mitchell?

486
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,860
I'd do anything for him.

487
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,550
Everyone would.

488
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:45,530
Anything he said,
ever since I left home.

489
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,750
He was everything.

490
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,040
How old were you when you left home?

491
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:49,780
Young.

492
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:52,430
And mitchell was everything.

493
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,500
And you did what he said too?

494
00:30:55,510 --> 00:31:00,600
Erika, how old were you
when he started with you?

495
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,540
Too young.

496
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,570
Do you know who killed him, erika?

497
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,330
Could dave have done it?

498
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:16,090
Dave is the one that likes to keep
everybody in line for mitchell.

499
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,110
Dave liked to do that.

500
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,470
Keep people in line.

501
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,480
Except for zak.

502
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,800
Zak isn't like the rest of us.

503
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:29,890
He and his sister.

504
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,520
Dave was worried zak would talk.

505
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,700
I found the aunt. The
kids' aunt. In phoenix.

506
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:45,710
Remarried, changed her
name. See that? Happy ending.

507
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,920
Yeah, this is detective
reese. You have a carin sutter.

508
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,490
She came in with her older brother zak.

509
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,590
Yeah. Okay. I got it.

510
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,830
They're gone.

511
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,470
They jumped out of the
car at a stop light.

512
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:12,300
Carin and her brother,
they're--they're gone.

513
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,400
We'll find them. We'll put out an
amber alert and we'll find them.

514
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:21,150
Dani-- detective,
we will find them.

515
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,410
Dave was worried zak would talk.

516
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,560
What if he finds them first?

517
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:30,230
Carin wanted to go home.

518
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,620
She just wanted to go home.

519
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:40,290
it's so stupid. So stupid. Stupid!

520
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:45,150
If you run, you'll only die tired.

521
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,210
I really wanted to shoot him.

522
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,960
No, you just really
wanted to shoot someone.

523
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:51,760
No, he would have done just fine.

524
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,710
Watch your head.

525
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,620
Where did that blood come from, dave?

526
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,790
I cut myself.

527
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:18,560
Carin, it's okay.

528
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:21,020
Where's zak?

529
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:24,720
Carin? Come here.

530
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,510
Where's your brother?

531
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:32,570
Don't!

532
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:36,840
Carin, it's okay. Let it go.

533
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:49,930
We can book dave for the
assault, but not for the murder.

534
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,260
Because the killer's right here.

535
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,970
Is he going to hurt my brother?

536
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,690
No.

537
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,210
No. No, sweetie, he's not.

538
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,770
Hey, dave swears he's
not good for the killing.

539
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:25,860
He said he hid the body so it looked like
mitchell was still alive, but did not kill him.

540
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:30,490
And get this, when I asked him how he got
the body across the floor without being seen,

541
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:36,040
dave told me he took the dead guy's arm, put
it around his shoulder, and walked him out.

542
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,320
Weekend at bernie-ish.

543
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:40,780
Everyone was looking for the
sales, no one even noticed.

544
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:46,440
I got something else too.

545
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:47,820
Yeah, what's that?

546
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:50,360
The kids' aunt.

547
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,880
She'd been looking for them.

548
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,920
She wants to take them home.

549
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,600
Time for you to go home.

550
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,730
But what about zak?

551
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:23,540
When we came in before,
down there, your sister,

552
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:28,940
with that stick, she protected you.

553
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,730
You protect her too.

554
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,820
Don't you, zak?

555
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,410
We protect each other.

556
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,380
Yeah, but you're the big brother.

557
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,830
You're the man, zak. Right?

558
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:49,160
We know what mitchell did to erika.

559
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:53,570
We know how old erika was when
mitchell started in with her.

560
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:56,070
You protected your sister.

561
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,440
You protected carin, so mitchell
would not do that to her.

562
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:03,680
I did what I had to do.

563
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,020
You know, I--I-- I had
to stop him. He had her.

564
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:18,130
So I chased him up the stairs, and
he was right next to the railing.

565
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,110
- And he tripped.
- No, he didn'T.

566
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,230
He tripped and fell.

567
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,470
Right over the railing.

568
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,660
There was nothing you could do.

569
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:35,520
Sometimes people just fall.

570
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,810
Hey, that looks like
your aunt over there.

571
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:02,210
Let me get you up.

572
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,670
How about that body?

573
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,540
What?

574
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:52,630
The one you and your partner found
in the pet store. That was good work.

575
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,260
Thanks.

576
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:59,540
- You don't mind if I--?
- No, no. I don't mind.

577
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,970
I, um, I thought you weren't coming.

578
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,790
Because of the kids.

579
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,430
Because I, uh, sent the
kids to children's services.

580
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,390
I thought you'd be pissed.

581
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,830
Well, that was the job.

582
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,560
The job's the job.

583
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,810
You did what you had to do.

584
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:23,010
So, you know, let's
just leave it back there.

585
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:26,250
All right. Good for
you. The job's the job.

586
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,410
Yep, that's the way I like to do it.

587
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,970
Some people, though, they can't-- they
can't leave it back there, you know?

588
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,140
They have to take it home with them.

589
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,460
Runs around in their
mind all night long.

590
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:43,450
Me, I just-- I
leave it at work.

591
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:48,880
But someone like that, they'd probably
be pretty pissed off at someone like me.

592
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:54,910
You okay?

593
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,450
You know what? I am pissed.

594
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:26,000
You know something?

595
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:29,570
You look a lot bigger from the side.

596
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,270
hi, this is jennifer.

597
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,190
I'm not here right now, but please leave
a message for me for when I am here.

598
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,320
Special agent bodner.

599
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,280
Federal bureau of investigation.

600
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,020
What happened to homeland security?

601
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,330
I was just on loan there.

602
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,620
Now I'm back where I belong.

603
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,820
Who shot your car?

604
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:28,490
I did.

605
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,510
You did?

606
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,860
My partner helped.

607
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,820
Yeah. Okay.

608
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:38,200
Is this the part where you tell
me there's something I should know?

609
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:42,530
Yeah, what you should know is that
I know you want mickey rayborn.

610
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:45,510
And that's not gonna happen.

611
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:50,700
Are the fbi investigating
him or protecting him?

612
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:53,230
Sometimes it's hard
to tell the difference.

613
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,600
But if you want rayborn,
you'd have to come at us.

614
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:58,230
And if you come at us,
you'll find yourself

615
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,010
and no ginchy little civil rights
lawyer is gonna get you out this time.

616
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,730
Gum?

617
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,250
Thanks.

618
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:20,480
Tropical fruit?

619
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:23,150
It's the only kind I chew.
