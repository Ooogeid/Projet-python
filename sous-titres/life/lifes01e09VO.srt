00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,710
Previously on life...

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,430
Rachel in the house.

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,380
She saw the killer.

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,740
How did you know what was in there?

5
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,130
I didn't exactly.

6
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,420
But something else i learned in prison,

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,340
You had to have something hidden away.

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,440
The lead detective on the case
that sent you to prison for 12 years

9
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,810
Just turned up shot to death.

10
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,210
I am going to be handling
this case personally.

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,740
Crews,this is my father.

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,490
Jack reese.

13
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,670
Charlie crews.

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,810
Of course. I know who you are.

15
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,060
Of course.

16
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,690
"Serious control issues"

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is the work of crazy person

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,580
Now,knowing what you went through,

19
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,560
It would be crazy if
you didn't go crazy.

20
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:52,250
But this,charlie,this...is crazy.

21
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,050
The police report says
she was out of the house.

22
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,840
Rachel seybolt was there
the night of the murders.

23
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,820
There's proof of that here,huh?

24
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,370
She drew a picture of the killer.

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,950
She was in the house the
night of the killings,ted.

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,320
Her bed was unmade.

27
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,150
A crayon drawing?

28
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,500
An unmade bed?

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,580
Okay.

30
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,070
The lead detective from my trial,

31
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,700
Shot dead at the police
station,just after-

32
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:26,170
Just after i saw him arguing with the
swat leader from the bank of la shootout.

33
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,770
Where all that money went missing.

34
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,070
Where all that money went missing.

35
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,530
That's actually a little scary.

36
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,170
Okay,what are you gonna do next?

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,050
I am going to bring things
that are hidden into the light.

38
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,540
Keep on rocking and
you'll never grow old.

39
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,470
What?

40
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,050
Oh,it's just something we used to say.

41
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,030
I guess it isn't true.

45
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,100
Serrated knife wound.

46
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,460
Not a lot of blood.

47
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,990
Must have bled out somewhere else.

48
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,890
Yeah,before the killer placed her here.

49
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,040
We don't want any trouble.

50
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,480
Neither do i,but it
just seems to find me.

51
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,270
Do you know that dead girl?

52
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,480
Do you like fruit?

53
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,970
You cops are all alike.

54
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,980
That's some kind of
pervy question,right?

55
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,320
It's just,you
look hungry,and i--

56
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,120
I have this bag of oranges in here,so...

57
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,290
Go ahead.

58
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,780
I do kind of like oranges.

59
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,750
Take it,it's--It's--
It's not pervy.

60
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,300
It's--It's
just an orange.

61
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,720
Why'd you walk away from us back there?

62
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,120
What'd you expect?

63
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,770
Come back to the crib,find
it crawling with cops.

64
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,120
You'd walk away too.

65
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,800
Only if i was guilty.

66
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,120
Yeah,well,cops don't usually
give us the benefit of the doubt.

67
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,010
I bet they don't usually
give you oranges,either.

68
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,920
We ain't doin' nothing for you
just because you gave us an orange.

69
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,650
How does that orange taste?

70
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,850
Good,i guess.

71
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,350
It's organic.

72
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,940
I grew that orange myself.

73
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,840
You grew this orange?

74
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,430
Did you know the girl?

75
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,590
Yeah.

76
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,390
Did you kill her?

77
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,040
Hell,no. Josie was our sister.

78
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,900
Josie? Josie what?

79
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,730
I thought you said she was your sister.

80
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,970
Well,not like blood.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,690
But on the street,you were family?

82
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,680
She turned up in the summer.

83
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,970
Came out with the sun under the ovat past

84
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,300
she played tunes at valley foods.

85
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,670
Some guy would give her food,and
she'd bring us back bread sometimes.

86
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,720
What guy?

87
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,820
She didn't say.

88
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,340
He gave her food and all
she did was play for him?

89
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,690
Look,that's all she said she did.

90
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,000
She had a real pretty voice.

91
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:09,590
Preliminary coroner's report indicates the victim
was killed between 5:00 and 11:00 last night.

92
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,640
Traces of semen with lack
of bruising or tearing

93
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:16,310
Indicates consensual sex two
to six hours before the crime.

94
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,280
What else do you have?

95
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,520
No missing persons reports
matching the description.

96
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,560
Prints came up clean.

97
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,320
Probably a runaway.

98
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,460
Didn't want to be found.

99
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,310
Or a throwaway.

100
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,820
No one wanted to find her.

101
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,730
Either way,the trail's gonna die
out quick without a solid lead.

102
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,000
Well,we'll go to the
supermarket where she hung out,

103
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,030
Try to find out some more information.

104
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,510
How's the ames investigation going?

105
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,800
It's ongoing.

106
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,410
Anything i can do to help?

107
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,070
Detective,if i were you,i
wouldn't be making jokes.

108
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,910
I was being serious.

109
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,590
Why--Why does nobody
take me seriously?

110
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,440
You owe me for the lock
on the door that you broke.

111
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,920
I'm submitting a bill.

112
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,030
Uh,dani,stay behind a minute.

113
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,960
Internal affairs is gonna
want to talk to you too,dani.

114
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,520
That's no surprise.

115
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,780
They're interested in what
crews might have said about ames.

116
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,740
Ames put crews away for 12 years.

117
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,810
No amount of zen in the world
can take the hate off that

118
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,530
Isn't there?

119
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,920
You got close to junkies,you became one.

120
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,230
You're close to crews.

121
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,190
You put me close to him.

122
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,190
No,you're close to crews now,

123
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,710
And you're starting to act like him.

124
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,420
This has gone beyond
the department,dani.

125
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,210
The trouble he's making has to stop.

126
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,770
They can't let it go on.

127
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,600
Do you understand?

128
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,940
Let me tell you how it's gonna happen.

129
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:44,870
They're gonna find a fold
of coke in your locker,

130
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,880
A bindle in your car.

131
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:47,960
You'd do that to me?

132
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,340
No,it's what i've been
trying to protect you from,

133
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,160
But i don't know how
much longer i can do that.

134
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,000
You want to talk about it?

135
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,980
You keep swallowing stuff like this,

136
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,720
You're gonna end up
with an ulcer or worse.

137
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,300
Okay,okay,then let's work the case.

138
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,110
Let's work the case.

139
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,320
Hey. You okay?

140
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,310
Easy,easy,just trying to help.

141
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,660
I'm--I'm--I'm
cool. Thanks.

142
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,350
I just lost my balance on the backside.

143
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,600
Nate?

144
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,470
Is that you?

145
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,270
Nice work. You carve it yourself?

146
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,280
Yeah.

147
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,380
I used to carve.

148
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,810
Helps pass the time.

149
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,950
I don't carve anymore.

150
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,900
Not since she took my knife away.

151
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,990
Why'd she do that?

152
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,490
Yeah,reese,why'd you take away my knife?

153
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,130
I don't think now is the
time to talk about it.

154
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,240
She's shy. I'll tell you.

155
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,390
I used it when i should have
been using my service weapon.

156
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,270
I get forgetful about things like that.

157
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,390
Service weapon?

158
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,290
Yeah,it's what we call guns.

159
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,780
Oh,you're--You're
cops?

160
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,430
Hey,nate,you ever see
a girl named josie?

161
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,180
I don't know. Maybe.

162
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,870
Um,did something happen to her?

163
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,880
Yeah,she was murdered.

164
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,250
You sure you don't know her?

165
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,000
Were you friends with josie?

166
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,570
You need a good knife
to carve like that.

167
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,980
Can we see your knife?

168
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,640
It's not my knife. Here.

169
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,310
Whose knife is it?

170
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,360
Nate?

171
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,420
Look,i'm sorry,i never saw her before.

172
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,430
Come here. Everything okay?

173
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,220
We're fine,dad.

174
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,750
Detective reese,lapd.

175
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,050
This is my partner,detective crews.

176
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,660
My boy causing trouble?

177
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,710
No,sir,not at all.

178
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,980
We were just asking him some questions
about a crime we're investigating.

179
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,240
Uh,you ever see this girl?

180
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,030
Yeah,yeah,she hangs
around here all the time.

181
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,800
Had to tell her to stop
harassing customers,

182
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,750
Playing some crapped-Out
guitar,begging for money.

183
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,280
She won't be bothering
anyone anymore,sir.

184
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,250
She was killed last night.

185
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,770
My god.

186
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,560
Poor thing.

187
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,480
Couldn't have been much older than nate.

188
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,460
Well,if you can think of
anything that might help at all.

189
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,890
Anything at all.

190
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,990
Sad,really.

191
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,940
These kids,living on the streets.

192
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,590
No parents to take care of them.

193
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,190
Yeah,it is.

194
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,230
All right,let's go.

195
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,060
Thanks.

196
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,350
What do you think?

197
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,800
I think we need to talk to that
kid when his dad isn't around.

198
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,220
How long before his
dad gets back from work?

199
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,950
The manager at valley foods who gave me
his address said ray's shift ends at 5:00.

200
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,040
Uh,my--My
dad's not here.

201
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,100
We're not here to talk to your dad.

202
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,820
No school today?

203
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,100
I'm homeschooled.

204
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,400
We do my work at night.

205
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,640
Nate,was there something you
wanted to tell us earlier?

206
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,100
Something about josie that you
couldn't say in front of your dad?

207
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,010
I--I told you.

208
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,690
I don't-- I don't know her.

209
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,630
A person's board probably says
a lot about their personal style.

210
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,410
Yeah,what does that say about you,nate?

211
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,230
It--It's just
a carving.

212
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,370
Nice work,though.

213
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,100
Took real time. You did it yourself?

214
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,850
You carve one like that for anyone else?

215
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,000
No?

216
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,540
'Cause that dancing bear looks
exactly like the one on josie's guitar.

217
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,450
I mean,almost like the
same person carved them.

218
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,500
I bet the lab could match them.

219
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,690
You seen the lab they
got down there,nate?

220
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,490
That lab can match anything to anything.

221
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:50,100
You fart,they'll bag
it,sample it,and peg it on you.

222
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,940
Carving is easy.

223
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,510
No,wait.

224
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,500
Okay,yeah,josie and i were friends.

225
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,000
What kind of friends?

226
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,990
The kind with benefits?

227
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,010
Kinda. We'd mess around sometimes.

228
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,350
Why'd you lie?

229
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,870
Because i didn't want
my dad to find out.

230
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,610
I'm not supposed to date.

231
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,560
He says i'm too young.

232
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,920
You're not gonna tell him,are you?

233
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,240
Not if we don't have to.

234
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:18,470
Nate,can you tell us where you were
between 5:00 and 11:00 last night?

235
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,100
I was working at the
market,breaking down boxes.

236
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,030
I can show you my timecard.

237
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,740
What kind of father doesn't want his
teenage son to show interest in girls?

238
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,890
The kind with serious control issues.

239
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,190
What are you doing?

240
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,550
What are you doing?

241
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,700
Crews,get out of there!

242
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,830
What are you doing?

243
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,860
Bars on the window.

244
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,610
Yeah,safety bars. A lot
of people have those.

245
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,040
Padlocks.

246
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,830
A lot of people have those too.

247
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,230
Look,we weren't invited.

248
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,410
Anything we find will
get thrown out in court.

249
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,400
That door is locked from the outside.

250
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,030
Do a lot of people have those too?

251
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,630
Reese,this is a cell.

252
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,560
Nate,what's with the lock on
the outside of the bedroom door?

253
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,570
I think you should leave.

254
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,280
And these locks on the windows.

255
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,720
That's the kind of stuff used
to hold someone captive,nate.

256
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,600
You know,josie wasn't
killed where we found her.

257
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,620
She was killed somewhere else.

258
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,570
You think--
No,no way.

259
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,920
Josie and i hooked up,but
i didn't kill her,i swear.

260
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,730
Yeah?

261
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,620
Well,a couple hours ago,you swore
that you didn't know her,either.

262
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,650
I told--I told you. I didn't want
my dad to find out. He'd freak.

263
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,290
Whose knife did you use on the
carvings on your board,nate?

264
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,730
Was it your dad's knife?

265
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,880
You should go,both of you.

266
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,420
My dad doesn't like visitors.

267
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,880
Nate,your dad isn't here right now.

268
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,030
This is just between us.

269
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,910
But we can only keep it between us

270
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,950
If you help us to prove you're innocent.

271
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,290
We met at the market a few months ago.

272
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,590
She was cool.

273
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,600
She said she'd teach me
some chords on the guitar.

274
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:09,090
We started meeting down at the
reservoir,just playing tunes and talking.

275
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,360
You and josie have sex?

276
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,540
No,we just made out and stuff.

277
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,210
Was there anyone else she
could have been having sex with?

278
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,960
I knew she was with other guys,but she
wouldn't talk about them in front of me.

279
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,940
But you knew who else she was with.

280
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,460
Because we always know,don't we?

281
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,830
There was this one dude,a trucker.

282
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,700
He delivered bread to the market,and
josie used to talk to him sometimes.

283
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,620
Now please leave.

284
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,900
My dad doesn't like
it when people come in.

285
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,260
What's with all the locks in here,nate?

286
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,930
I'm not exactly sure what
business that is of yours.

287
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,230
Did you ask these two in,nate?

288
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,290
No,sir.

289
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,920
I told them not to come
in. I told them to leave.

290
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,500
Is that true?

291
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,220
Did nate ask you to leave?

292
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,750
Yeah,he asked us to leave.

293
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,430
So you're in here without a warrant.

294
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,530
Without any cause.

295
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,390
You want to come out of
here with us now,nate?

296
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,960
You can tell them the truth,son.

297
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,910
I want you both to leave.

298
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,810
I didn't want you in here to begin with,

299
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,590
And i asked you not to come in.

300
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,290
Something you want to say to me?

301
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,450
I know you.

302
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,260
Yeah. We met today at the store.

303
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,830
It's good to see you.

304
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,570
Now get the hell out of my house.

305
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:37,600
No,i mean,we never met,but i know you.

306
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,740
What the hell is he talking about?

307
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,730
Crews,we should leave.

308
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,340
I know you because you're all alike.

309
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,370
You've all got that look.

310
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,800
You're a guard,aren't you,ray?

311
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,510
You are way out of bounds here.

312
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:54,740
You like the keys,don't
you,ray,and the locks?

313
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,900
I know you.

314
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,040
And i know what you're afraid of.

315
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,660
Crews,we are leaving.

316
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,660
My name is detective crews.

317
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:17,120
If you ever need it,you call 911
and you ask for detective crews.

318
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,640
What the hell was that?

319
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,790
That was a boy behind bars.

320
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,350
No,that was a cop out of control.

321
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,970
We will call social services.

322
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,330
We will get a search warrant.

323
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,100
But you
jus--

324
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,920
Look,i know you're under a lot of
pressure with this whole i.A.D. Thing,

325
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,380
But you better buckle it
up,or you're gonna come loose.

326
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,320
Sorry,i'm sorry,i'm sorry.

327
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,250
Detective,this meeting
has been set for days.

328
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,620
There's no excuse for you to be late.

329
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,970
Probably hard for you to
understand,seeing what you do,

330
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,920
But i've just been out
there,trying to stop crime.

331
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:04,540
Detective,why don't you come
on over here and sit by me?

332
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:11,810
Second interview with detective crews concerning
the murder of detective carl ames,retired.

333
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,890
Present,judith
raitt,i.A.D.,john garrity,

334
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,830
Detective's union,and
detective charles crews.

335
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,570
No one calls me charles.

336
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,210
And before we start,i'd
just like to say,

337
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,760
It was real nice of you to
stop by my house the other day.

338
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,330
Maybe someday you'll have
me over to your place.

339
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,350
I'd like to know why,considering
the size of your settlement,

340
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,140
You decided to return to the force.

341
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,770
Because i'm a good cop.

342
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,620
Don't you think the
city needs good cops?

343
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:39,220
I'd like to know if you're conducting an
independent and unauthorized investigation

344
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,660
Into the circumstances of
your arrest and imprisonment.

345
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,850
See the way she does that?

346
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,610
She's like a laser.
She--Rrarr--Locks right in.

347
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,910
Stop wasting time and
answer her question.

348
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,480
Are you or are you not conducting
an independent investigation?

349
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,470
I investigate things.

350
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,980
What kind of things?

351
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,620
I investigate things to
complete my knowledge.

352
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,720
My complete knowledge
makes my thoughts sincere.

353
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,010
My thoughts being
sincere,my heart is pure.

354
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,170
Here we go.

355
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,580
Reader's digest?

356
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,440
That's confucius.

357
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,120
- It's good,though,isn't it?
- Yeah.

358
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,160
Don't you want a pure
heart? I know i do.

359
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,530
Detective,is it your intention not
to cooperate with this investigation?

360
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,160
I investigate things.

361
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,980
You do so have a talent for mayhem.

362
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,940
Sunday best?

363
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,500
Nothing but for i.A.D.

364
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,030
I'd known you were on deck,i
wouldn't have gotten them so riled up.

365
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,460
You okay,bobby?

366
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,990
What should i tell them,charlie?

367
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,130
Tell them the truth.

368
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,430
That's what i did 12 years ago.

369
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,800
That didn't turn out so well,huh?

370
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,060
Hey,got a line on that
trucker nate told us about.

371
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,030
Dean gill.

372
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,510
The bread delivery guy.

373
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,530
You want to get some work done,

374
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,710
Maybe we can go lean
on him,see what happens.

375
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,820
"Maybe we can go lean on him."

376
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,480
My wife talked like that.

377
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,910
Gotta lay off those little blue pills.

378
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,580
Dean gill's employer said he hadn't
been to work in three days,and...

379
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,940
Wait for it. His truck is missing.

380
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,460
Cats. I hate cats.

381
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,530
Actually,i think they're kittens.

382
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,410
Well,i hate them too.

383
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,940
What are you doing in here?

384
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,080
Are you dean gill?

385
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,780
Yeah,yeah.

386
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,460
Close the door,'cause i don't
want my little ones to wander off.

387
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,160
You broke my door in.

388
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,690
We heard screaming.

389
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,760
We thought we...

390
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,520
We thought we heard screaming.

391
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,450
Well,it wasn't screaming.

392
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,230
It was my little ones.

393
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,820
Can't smell them,though,can you?

394
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:18,620
36 i have,and it's
fresh as a daisy in here.

395
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:23,000
Now i'd like you to please leave,as
owning kittens is not a crime.

396
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,570
Your boss reported
his truck stolen,dean,

397
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,730
And yet,here it is,in your backyard.

398
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,960
I don't understand why
he reported it stolen.

399
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,810
I take it home every once in a while.

400
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,710
And you park it back here?

401
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,150
We have a lot of vandals
in this part of town.

402
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,480
They like to mess with my rig.

403
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,290
You know a girl named josie?

404
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:48,570
And this is the truck used to
deliver bread to valley foods?

405
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,620
Been making the drop at valley foods
same time every day for the last year.

406
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,230
You never saw a girl named josie?

407
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,280
If i did,she didn't
make much of an impact.

408
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,060
Is she in some kind of trouble?

409
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,820
Yeah,she's dead.

410
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,640
Man,that's rough.

411
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:08,580
I read about stuff like that,but...man.

412
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,420
Mind if we take a look in your rig?

413
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,380
No. Go to town.

414
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,660
It looks clean.

415
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,150
Like it's been washed.

416
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,910
That's why i bring it home.

417
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,720
The yeast builds up.
You get an awful stink.

418
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,320
We all good?

419
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,650
You play guitar,do you?

420
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,130
I need to use the hopper.

421
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,220
Hold it.

422
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,560
You know where i found those?

423
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,960
With your morning paper?

424
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,210
That's a good guess.

425
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,240
No guessing.

426
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,070
I put them there.

427
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,200
You want to tell us how
you came by these pictures?

428
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,050
Oh,i think he's about to do that.

429
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,680
Aren't you,detective crews?

430
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,740
Yeah,i took 'em.

431
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,210
I was seen with ames,you know that.

432
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,360
That's why you organized that little
gathering at my house the other day.

433
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,270
That's why you're digging into my life.

434
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,060
You dig a little deeper,you
will find i did not kill ames.

435
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,240
Is that what we'll find?

436
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,470
We?

437
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,360
That's what the police will find.

438
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,850
You're retired,right,jack?

439
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,890
Yeah,that's right.

440
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:57,460
Me,i'm still on the job,so i'm
curious,as a homicide detective,

441
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:00,760
When someone is gonna
question you for ames' death.

442
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,610
Because,and i'm sorry if i'm
using the wrong tone here,

443
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,540
But those photos look a lot like you are in a
violent disagreement with the late carl ames.

444
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,080
Detective crews,the ames
investigation is none of your concern.

445
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,270
It's okay,karen.

446
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,810
I argued with carl last week,the week
before that,and the week before that.

447
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,030
We argued about football.

448
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,980
We were friends.

449
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,770
Nice.

450
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,550
That mouth of yours ever
get you in any trouble?

451
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,050
Okay,detective,lay out your case.

452
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,270
My case?

453
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,740
Yeah,you're a homicide detective.

454
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,620
You're making a case. Lay it out for me.

455
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,490
Lay it out,then maybe i'll let you know

456
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,960
Whether or not you'll end up back in
federal prison or in the county morgue.

457
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:00,890
The seybolt girl was in that house
the night her family was murdered.

458
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,730
Ames changed the police
report,said she wasn't there.

459
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,870
Ames took her out of that house.

460
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,570
And you went to ames with this?

461
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,780
I did,and then i followed him to you.

462
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,870
Let's leave me out of
this for the moment.

463
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,000
Stick with ames and the girl,rachel.

464
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,550
She saw the killer.

465
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,270
And you know this how?

466
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,650
She drew a sketch of him.

467
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,570
You have this sketch?

468
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,850
I do.

469
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,660
Did you come by it legally?

470
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,630
Rachel saw the killer.

471
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,460
I went to ames with that.

472
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,470
Ames went to you.

473
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,390
And now ames is dead.

474
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,500
Son,you keep going where you're
going, and you're gonna find trouble

475
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,890
Whether it was there
to begin with or not.

476
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,120
And you would do well to
keep my daughter out of it.

477
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,070
Where are you going?

478
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,910
I have a witness to interrogate.

479
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:01,710
Dapper dan,mr.
Plithers,bonkers,kitty bin laden?

480
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,550
He's sort of psycho.

481
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,460
Names of his kittens.

482
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,450
Past and present.

483
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,820
You have a nice talk?

484
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,300
No,not really.

485
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:13,310
Am i supposed to understand this?

486
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,440
Do you want to know what he wanted?

487
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,390
He always wants the same thing.

488
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,820
Yeah,what is that?

489
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,220
Everyone else's unhappiness.

490
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,610
Is this some sort of good cop/bad cop?

491
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,600
Because it ain't working on me.

492
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,970
Did you ask him about josie?

493
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,160
I have no kitten named josie.

494
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,590
Josie the dead girl.

495
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,790
Why do you have so many kittens?

496
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,860
I like the way they sing.

497
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,570
We found semen in the dead girl.

498
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,570
She give you sex for food?

499
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,730
Semen?

500
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,980
It's not mine.

501
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:47,300
I don't copulate,detective.

502
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,510
Ever?

503
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,170
Ever.

504
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:55,410
I do,however,need to move my
bowels,which i've told you already.

505
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,600
You know what happens when we find
that guitar pick,don't you,dean?

506
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,810
You'll get your hands dirty?

507
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,880
We pull josie's dna off
it and put you in jail.

508
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,830
She was in my truck.

509
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,760
She used to play for me and sing.

510
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:19,130
Her music was very vivid,

511
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:23,150
Almost as vivid as
claudius,gustav,and raritan the lesser.

512
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:27,770
But if you're looking
to me for her murder,

513
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,830
You're looking the wrong way.

514
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:40,410
I.A.D. Says you stay on
duty,so you stay on duty.

515
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,890
You want to request a new partner?

516
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,320
No,ma'am.

517
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,320
Then i need u working.

518
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,580
The search warrant came
through for the hastings house.

519
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,100
Children's services will meet you there.

520
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,870
If your boy dean in there didn't kill
josie,maybe the skateboard kid or his dad did it.

521
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,170
Either way,the kid's in danger.

522
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,380
They cleared out the apartment and fled.

523
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,090
All right,thanks.

524
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,750
I've got bolo and amber alerts wide.

525
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,920
We'll find them.

526
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,080
You think the dad killed josie
and took the kid on the run,

527
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:53,060
Or did the kid kill josie and
the dad took him on the run,

528
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:57,090
Or did ray and nate do it
together,father and son?

529
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,360
Can you imagine living like this?

530
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:04,950
Don't have to.

531
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,680
Right.

532
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,890
Because of the whole prison thing.

533
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,330
Yeah,copy that.

534
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,750
About your dad...

535
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,300
Yeah. Let me make this easy on you.

536
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:23,070
I spent my childhood trying to figure out
if my dad was only mean or just plain bad.

537
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,080
And you,i don't really understand you.

538
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,410
I don't really like you,but...

539
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,550
You're not one of the bad guys.

540
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:41,780
If i had your money,i'd
be on a beach somewhere.

541
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,430
How come you're not
on a beach somewhere?

542
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,960
Do i look like i tan?

543
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,850
The things people do with their kids.

544
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,510
Parents and children.

545
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:02,470
Cats and kittens.

546
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,660
Where were all the cats?

547
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,800
What cats?

548
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,410
At dean gill's.

549
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,780
All those kittens,but
where were the cats?

550
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,130
Cats,lots of them.

551
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,640
And their throats?

552
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,870
Hard to tell,but it looks
like they've been cut.

553
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,340
Looks like you kept more than
that truck in your backyard.

554
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:36,600
Tomorrow around this time,we're
gonna get those lab tests back,deanie.

555
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,810
My mother called me deanie.

556
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:41,250
I'd appreciate it if you did not.

557
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,900
Sure thing.

558
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:47,630
We're gonna get those lab tests back and
it's not gonna be good news for you,dean.

559
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:52,320
I fart,that lab can put it in
a bag and peg it back to me.

560
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,420
Did you fart?

561
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,840
First you did it to the
cats,then you did it to josie.

562
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,490
What,were you practicing?

563
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,940
Just getting warmed up?

564
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,090
Didn't.

565
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:01,820
Didn't do anything.

566
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,690
That's not what the
lab tests are gonna say.

567
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,970
He wants something,reese.

568
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,820
Don't you,dean?

569
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,590
You wanted something and you took it,

570
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,840
First from the cats and then from josie.

571
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,530
Isn't that right?

572
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,780
Okay,here's how it's gonna work.

573
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:21,690
The lab's gonna call us up,say that they matched
those serrations on the cats to the one on josie.

574
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,590
You remember josie,don't you?

575
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,140
The murdered girl?

576
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,840
The girl that used to
have the beautiful voice.

577
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,510
You liked that voice.

578
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,580
Why'd you do that to her,dean?

579
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,570
You wanted something and
you took it,didn't you,dean?

580
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,260
Didn't. Didn't do anything.

581
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,340
What happens to kittens
when they turn into cats?

582
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,460
What happens to little girls
when they turn into women?

583
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:52,020
What happens to their
voice just as they grow up?

584
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:58,110
What happened to
you,deanie,just as you grew up?

585
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,720
Okay. Deal time.

586
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,330
You cop to it right now,and we
don't ask for special circumstances.

587
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:10,350
That means we don't file the death
papers,and you avoid the gurney.

588
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:14,370
But you gotta
go right now or--

589
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,930
Or we walk out that door.

590
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,570
I took out her voice.

591
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:44,040
I--I--I just wanted her
voice,so i--I took it.

592
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,340
If nate and ray didn't
do it,why did they run?

593
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,570
Why does anyone run from anything?

594
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,230
'Cause they're guilty.

595
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,000
Where's nate's mother?

596
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,360
You think this is a custody beef?

597
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,900
Father takes the kid,we stumble on them,

598
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:05,140
And they have to go on the run.

599
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,160
Let's track down the mother.

600
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:15,220
How is this possible?

601
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,870
There's no record of
nate having a mother.

602
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,070
See if there's a record of nate.

603
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,350
They're not father and son.

604
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,360
We thought it might be a custody
thing,that that's why they ran.

605
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,490
Dad takes kid away from
mom. Happens all the time.

606
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,800
So we try to locate the mom.

607
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:33,750
There isn't one.

608
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,110
Never was one.

609
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,960
We went back and checked ray's records.

610
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:40,100
There's no record of
ray ever having a kid.

611
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,520
No deductions for
dependents for tax records.

612
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,570
No school records.

613
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,630
There's no record anywhere of
a birth certificate for the son.

614
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,780
Nate hastings is not ray's kid.

615
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,830
Then who is nate?

616
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,410
And where did he come from?

617
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,650
Fbi*****

618
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,930
To prints in the missing child database.

619
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,320
Nate's real name is steven weston.

620
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,970
Taken from his front yard 12 years ago.

621
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,690
He was what,three?

622
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,190
Fbi sent us this news
footage they pulled,1995.

623
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,910
I'm asking the person who took
steven to look into his heart,

624
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:19,160
To think about the heart of his
mother and bring him home to us.

625
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,980
Have they told the real parents?

626
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,930
They're waiting to see how it turns out.

627
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,120
They've got nationwide alerts
out for both ray and nate.

628
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:29,530
He was skateboarding outside of
that supermarket when we met him.

629
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,230
And josie was teaching him guitar.

630
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,550
Yeah,by the reservoir. I remember.

631
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,210
But this isn't an abduction.

632
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,590
Ray trusts nate e not to run.

633
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,870
After everything he's put him through?

634
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:44,240
Those locks in that house,ray
doesn't have to use those anymore.

635
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:48,740
Nate takes those locks and bars
with him wherever he goes now.

636
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:55,550
Sometimes... sometimes all
the convict has is the guard.

637
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,860
So if ray trusts nate,then
we don't have an abduction.

638
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,520
We have two people on the run.

639
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,900
And when two people go on the run...

640
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,270
They split up.

641
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,550
So we need to stop looking for
them as a pair,as a man with a boy.

642
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,750
We need to tell the fbi to
look for them separately.

643
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,200
You have to stop messing with i.A.D.

644
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,980
How am i messing with them?

645
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,830
I got the transcripts,charlie.

646
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:24,810
Telling the i.A.D. You're in search of a
pure heart is not the way to help yourself.

647
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:27,390
But i am in search of a pure heart.

648
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:30,590
Can i offer you some advice as a lawyer?

649
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,430
Sure.

650
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,090
Get a good lawyer and
keep your mouth shut.

651
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:40,010
Can i offer you some advice as a friend?

652
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,030
Sure.

653
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:44,190
Maybe you shouldn't be
hanging around so many cops.

654
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,930
Some of them are turning
up dead,and some of them...

655
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,850
Some of them what?

656
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,140
Might not be in search of a pure heart.

657
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,950
Some of them might be in
search of something else.

658
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,310
Crews.

659
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,870
I'm on my way.

660
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,580
They found ray.

661
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,240
What about the boy?

662
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,960
Put your hands in the air!

663
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:59,500
Down! Down on your knees! Get down now!

664
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,340
Don't move!

665
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,300
Get your hands behind your head!

666
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,580
Where is he?

667
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,050
I don't know who you're talking about.

668
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:06,960
Where's nate?

669
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,480
I don't know anyone named nate.

670
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,110
The boy you abducted.

671
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:10,950
Where is he?

672
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,700
I live alone. Always have.

673
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,680
Feel free to go inside.

674
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,710
Take a look. Door's open.

675
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,640
I have no need for locks.

676
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,160
Never did.

677
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,030
He's not gonna be in there,is he?

678
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,570
We're not gonna find him.

679
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,760
Sure we are.

680
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,940
Yeah? How?

681
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,890
The same way you find
a needle in a haystack.

682
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,970
With a magnet.

683
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:46,770
You're under arrest for the murder
of the boy known as nate hastgs.

684
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,560
He loves you,doesn't he?

685
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,180
I don't know who you're talking about.

686
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,520
Sure you do.

687
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,460
You can feel it.

688
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,960
In your heart,you can
feel nate's love for you.

689
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,860
It's warm,isn't it?

690
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,700
I see his love in your smile just there.

691
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:06,060
It's that love that's gonna bring him to
us and put you away for a very long time

692
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,120
'Cause if nate stays hidden,he
can't clear you for his murder.

693
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,820
And that's what he needs to do for you.

694
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,530
When the news picks up that you've
been arrested for nate's murder,

695
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,130
And your face is all over the tv,

696
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:22,120
He'll come out of hiding
to save you,won't he,ray?

697
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:26,270
Must be some kind of a father
to get a kid to do that.

698
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,940
I know what you're afraid of.

699
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,720
Ray and nate could have split up.

700
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,230
Nate could still be out there

701
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:59,260
But you do know there could be another
reason we haven't found the kid yet.

702
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,230
Didn't know they made them that small.

703
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,360
It's a personal pineapple.

704
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,790
All right,i have to know.

705
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,880
What's the deal with the fruit?

706
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,780
Do you know what you eat in prison?

707
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,750
Crap?

708
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,620
Crap.

709
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,710
No fresh fruit.

710
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,480
Ever.

711
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,250
I missed it.

712
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,570
I don't think it'd be
fruit that i'd be missing.

713
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,240
Yeah,it would.

714
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,340
I will try to use it
for good instead of evil.

715
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,260
Detective crews.

716
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,980
You said i could call if i needed help.

717
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,590
Josie was teaching
me how to play guitar.

718
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,450
I didn't get very far.

719
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,200
You know,just a few chords.

720
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:55,050
I was at the bus station and
i heard these people talking.

721
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:00,940
They read on some website that he
stole me,stole when i was a kid.

722
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,970
Ray loves me.

723
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,440
Okay.

724
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,590
He's my father.

725
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,590
Okay.

726
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,300
I'm his son.

727
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:20,540
It said on the news that
you had him for my murder.

728
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,030
He would never hurt me.

729
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,770
Ever.

730
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,380
Do you want to talk to him?

731
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,630
That's my son.

732
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,210
I'm sorry,dad.

733
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,950
It's going to take some time.

734
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,550
He's gonna need counseling.

735
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,470
Medical treatment.

736
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,810
It's gonna take time.

737
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:43,370
What those people said...

738
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:50,620
About ray taking me when i
was a kid,it's true,isn't it?

739
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,860
If he's not my dad,i'm not his son.

740
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:01,720
If i'm not his son...

741
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,460
Who are you?

742
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,870
I'm supposed to take you
down to children's services,

743
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,990
But i don't want to go down.

744
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,730
I got another idea.

745
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,260
I want to tell you something.

746
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,670
It's not gonna be easy for you.

747
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:53,280
You're never gonna be like anyone else.

748
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,420
Because of what happened to me.

749
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,990
Yeah.

750
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,610
How do you know that?

751
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,950
Because of what happened to me.

752
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,670
What happened to you?

753
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,060
The same thing that happened to you.

754
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,080
So when do we take off?

755
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,040
Oh,i don't know how to fly this thing.
