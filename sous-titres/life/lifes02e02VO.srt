1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,950
Previously,on life...

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,100
where'd you get this?

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,100
Oh,you don't want to know.

4
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,460
Serious cop with serious friends.

5
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,730
Ted,if you wanna walk away,I understand.

6
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,460
I wanna know where rachel seybolt is.

7
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,500
She's gone.

8
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,410
Her family died and she got a new one.

9
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,890
And don't you dare try to find her.

10
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,420
Please get out of my husband's car.

11
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,080
The fire sent me to get you.

12
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,310
To take you from here.

13
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,230
It's okay.

14
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,230
<font color="#ffff00">Life Season02
Episode02 Everything. . . All the Time</font>

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,070
the stab wound has healed nicely.

16
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,930
Where was she treated?

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,430
Any other injuries?

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,590
No sign of abuse.

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,880
It's just that she won't
speak. It's not physical.

20
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,780
She can speak if she wanted to.

21
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:51,510
Is there someone else besides yourself who
knows her or whom she might open up and speak to?

22
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,320
Yeah. There is.

23
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,670
Would you like us to contact them?

24
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,360
No,I'll take care of that.

25
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,540
see?

26
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,040
This is why gangs get
themselves a bad reputation.

27
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,170
You piss 'em off,they tie you to a
chair,and leave you in the bottom of a pool.

28
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,160
Uh,I got a wallet here.

29
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,590
Driver's license.

30
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,100
Max horta. 36 years old.

31
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,360
You piss off a gang,max?

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,540
You two go check out the victim.

33
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,470
Go talk to his family.

34
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,360
Oh,you have alternate plans?

35
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,580
It's a gang. Round 'em all up,toss
'em in cells,see who squawks.

36
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,660
A gang?

37
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,870
No. Max kept to himself.
Kept to our family.

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,720
Gangs? Nunca.

39
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,480
He brought your daughter to work?

40
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:12,090
When it's not a school
night,sometimes max takes-- took--

41
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,050
elsa to work with him.

42
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,560
They didn't come home for
breakfast so we came down here.

43
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,010
Elsa was sitting there all alone.

44
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,080
No max.

45
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,760
Elsa,can you tell us
what happened last night?

46
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,180
He's dead.

47
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,090
You can't help him now.
What difference does it make?

48
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,770
I'm gonna tell you a secret.

49
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:46,350
My partner over there
never lets me drive the car.

50
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,630
Never. Nunca.

51
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,290
Can you tell me your secret,elsa?

52
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,250
I sat here,doing my homework.

53
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,920
And what was your father doing?

54
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,630
He was over there. On the phone.

55
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,220
Do you know who he was talking to?

56
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,370
No. He was very angry.

57
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,010
Talking about some building.

58
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,130
When he hung up,he told me to wait here.

59
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,050
He told me not to move.

60
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,040
He never came back.

61
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,360
Did your father say an address?

62
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,290
Just a name.

63
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,710
The bankley building?

64
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,270
That can't be true. That's not true.
That is not true! That can't be true!

65
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,950
the bankley building.

66
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,430
what were you doing here?

67
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,360
there was a party.

68
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,920
you sure the party was here?

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,740
What kind of party,carla?

70
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,500
Terrible party.

71
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,140
Who threw the party,carla?

72
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,550
I don't know,the people
from the other side of town.

73
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,160
The "rich" side of
town. I don't know them.

74
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,640
What happened here last night?

75
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:59,380
I think that there was something in my
drink,'cause I can't remember anything.

76
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,450
Was it your first time
at a party like this?

77
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,940
Yes.

78
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,630
No,there were others.

79
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,830
All in empty buildings?

80
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,430
How'd you know where
the parties will be?

81
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,630
We get a text. Me and my friends.

82
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,630
We don't know from
who,but we get a text.

83
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,630
And then we just--
just show up.

84
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,170
All your friends get this text?

85
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,880
No,just the pretty ones.

86
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,050
Your father was beaten to death,badly.

87
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,870
Neck snapped,ribs
broken,joints shattered.

88
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,040
Whoever is capable of
doing this is an animal.

89
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,930
Man,I heard he chews the
bottle after he shoots it.

90
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,680
Drinks blood to get like-- to look
like he is,man. Boy's a monster.

91
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,830
Something I can help you with?

92
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,620
Funny you should say that.

93
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,500
Oh,man. This guy's a cop,man.

94
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,240
Something I said?

97
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,790
How come when you want to get a kid
to talk,you always make fun of me?

98
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,970
I do? Do I?

99
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,280
- Yes.
- Not always. Do I?

100
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,320
Do you want to drive the car?

101
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,460
Do you want me to drive the car?

102
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,940
No,I don'T.

103
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,790
Hey,bro!

104
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,130
That's no fair,man. You weren't
supposed to be in the cells.

105
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,900
Not supposed to be in,yet just
can't seem to stay out of 'em.

106
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,520
I got an expectation of privacy.

107
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,740
Hey,stop talkin',man.

108
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,240
I got your personal effects here.

109
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,990
I heard he chews the
bottle after he shoots it?

110
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,150
That's just exactly what I said.

111
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,870
Hey,he knows,man. You
need to stop talking.

112
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,590
He chew this kind of bottle?

113
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,350
Quality steroids?

114
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,730
It's not the kind of junk we
usually find on you fellas.

115
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,270
You fellas? That's profiling
right there,is what that is.

116
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,820
Boy's a monster?

117
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,400
Turns out,we're looking for a monster.

118
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,090
you help us find him,we'll
help you with holding this.

119
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,450
Help us with this?

120
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,920
You get caught with this,all you get is
to testify in front of the U.S.Senate.

121
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,020
- What he said.
- Can we go?

122
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,420
Yeah,you can go down to processing.

123
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,240
Should take a few days.
System's real slow.

124
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,740
We'll talk again then.

125
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,900
What she said.

126
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,540
Narcotics tracked the steroids to
a flext gym,over in beverly hills.

127
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,220
Is there a monster in beverly hills,max?

128
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,390
You believe in monsters?

129
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,090
Don't you?

130
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,230
Ah,detectives.

131
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,220
How can I help you?

132
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,730
- are yothe manager?
- Owner.

133
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,930
Dr. Jackson bridger.

134
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,810
- This is ours.
- Yours?

135
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,290
Yes,this is part of our
flext steroid regimen.

136
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,000
Your regimen?

137
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,220
You dispense steroids here?

138
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,990
I'm a board-certified
physician,so I prescribe them.

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,810
Our pharmacist dispenses them.

140
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,640
Can I ask you where you got this?

141
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,970
Off a couple of gang-bangers.

142
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,470
They probably don't work out here.

143
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,640
No,they probably don'T.

144
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,900
Any idea how they could
have gotten a hold of this?

145
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:31,280
What happens to them after I
prescribe them,I,uh,I really can't say.

146
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,920
My wife looks familiar
to you,doesn't she?

147
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,960
Yeah,but I can't place her.

148
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,110
Does this help? September,1999?

149
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,960
No,I was away.

150
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,990
Miss september,1999.

151
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,210
Likes hikes? Fresh-baked bread?

152
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,260
Puppies?

153
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,410
Since you dispense steroids
to the members of the gym,

154
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,740
it'd be a big help if we could
take a look at your membership list.

155
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,990
Sorry,no can do.

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,540
You see,the--the people
training here pay a lot of money.

157
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,920
- They have a certain,uh--
- expectation of privacy.

158
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:06,730
Yeah,yeah.

159
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,520
Well,uh,we could come
back with a warrant.

160
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,200
With that,I wish you the best of luck.

161
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,840
These folks are not members.
They are my patients.

162
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,640
Their records are covered by
doctor-patient confidentiality.

163
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,470
Carla horta goes to a bad
party,someone calls her father.

164
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,450
Father shows up,probably not very happy.

165
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,560
Father gets extremely beaten to death.

166
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,610
Couple of bangers talking
about a guy capable of that,

167
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,610
holding steroids traced back to here.

168
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,820
I do it because children
seem to enjoy it.

169
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,540
When I make fun of you.

170
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,800
Because they think you're uptight.

171
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:49,010
I am-- I am--
I am no uptight.

172
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,240
I'm not uptight. If you wanna
drive the car,go ahead and drive.

173
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,640
Take a look at that.

174
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,520
bankley. Now there's a name we know.

175
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,100
benny bankley.

176
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,660
His father brendan bankley
anowns bkley realty.

177
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,940
Which owns the bankley building.

178
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,920
Where the party took place.

179
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,980
What's the son of the building's owner doing
going into the gym where the steroids came from?

180
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,810
Don't know.

181
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,990
Benny does not look capable of
breaking every bone in max horta's body.

182
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:37,400
You know,just because I don't say everything
that pops into my head does not make me uptight.

183
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,810
I didn't say you're uptight.

184
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:41,230
I said kids think you're uptight.

185
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,470
Though kids are tough
to fool about that.

186
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,280
Kids are notoriously tough to fool.

187
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,980
What did those bangers say again?

188
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,480
"Boy's a monster."

189
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,100
Marty hawkins,used to play
high school ball with benny.

190
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,270
Marty had a little
more team spirit though.

191
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,120
He took a bat to the opposing
team's pitcher,broke his leg.

192
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,590
- He do time?
- No.

193
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,230
Released on condition he had counseling.

194
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,060
Two more assault beefs
knocked down the same way.

195
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,210
Oh,to grow up rich and connected.

196
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,530
- You're rich,right,crews?
- Not from birth.

197
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,310
You're so rich,how come
you don't have a car?

198
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,560
I gave it away.

199
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,550
Really? See,I heard that your
"roommate" ran over it with a tractor.

200
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,700
That was the other one.

201
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,220
annabelle shore.

202
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,580
What exactly do they do to the
not beautiful in that part of town?

203
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,570
Annabelle went to the same high
school as our other two friends here.

204
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,010
But unlike them,she has a job.

205
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,320
And her parents?

206
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,820
Mom is a pricey defense attorney.

207
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,090
Dad died when she was a kid.

208
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,100
Why aren't you bringing
these kids in for questioning?

209
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,390
On what charge?

210
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,240
You guys don't plant
evidence around here?

211
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,840
Our gang of three is
at a table set for four.

212
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,540
Our gang doesn't have a leader.

213
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,580
What's up,big guy? What's up,man?

214
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm guessing that's him.

215
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,450
Patrick bridger.

216
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,160
Same high school as the other three,but
patrick is just a little bit smarter.

217
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,300
His iq tested in the genius range.

218
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,080
Does that really mean anything?

219
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,440
Pretty sure it does.

220
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,780
Child chess master,pitcher on the high
school baseball team,thrown out of yale.

221
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,550
For?

222
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,410
Apparently,just never going
to class. Not even once.

223
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,250
And patrick's father,jackson
bridger. Owner of flext.

224
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,630
Where the steroids came from.

225
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,100
Where the steroids came from.

226
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,190
Anybody up there look familiar?

227
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,520
We talk,we walk?

228
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,680
Hulk here.

229
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,050
- He gave us them 'roids.
- What'd you give him?

230
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,620
Phone numbers for hood girls.

231
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,730
Just the pretty ones?

232
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,520
A couple of hood rats point their
fingers at some beverly hills kid.

233
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,830
Who's connected enough to walk
away from three assault raps.

234
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,410
Yo,maybe y'all should plant something.

235
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,130
- The oatmeal's $20.
- I'm buying,have two.

236
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,550
Oh yeah,you're rich.

237
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,010
But I guess you worked for it.

238
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,410
Did you just say something ni?To me

239
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,410
no,I don't think so.

240
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,280
Put that down.

241
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,150
They're not boys. They're dogs.

242
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,990
Patrick-- one in the
middle-- alpha dog.

243
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:50,610
Marty,he's second. Beta dog.

244
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,080
Benny... omega dog. He's the fool.

245
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,410
Hmm,that's what you see.

246
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,160
I see a group of spoiled rich kids.

247
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,200
And I want the big one in lock-up.

248
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,060
If that's what you want,that
is what you shall have.

249
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,100
On what charge?

250
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,450
Assaulting a police officer?

251
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,400
This one's got it's name
written all over you.

252
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,520
Can we help you?

253
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,950
See? Alpha dog. Beta dog,right?

254
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,180
You're the one with his
nose always up alpha's ass?

255
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,980
Man,you're a big one! 'Roids,right?
Is it true what they say?

256
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:37,320
It makes some things big,but other
things,you know,like,real small?

257
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,240
Police! Down on the floor,now! Now!

258
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,580
Can I help you?

259
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,570
I know you know who I am,so
let's not pretend you don'T. Okay?

260
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,440
You're jack reese.

261
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,590
That's right.

262
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:31,590
And you're-chat ex paonrolee
that lives with crews.

263
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,230
I know crews has that girl.

264
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,160
I need you to tell me what else he has.

265
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,160
Why would I do that?

266
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,020
If you don't,I violate your parole.

267
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,180
You're not even a cop anymore.

268
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,510
You just keep saying that when you're back
in the slam serving that last four years.

269
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,490
"Jack reese wasn't even a cop anymore."

270
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,420
Do you like empty swimming pools,marty?

271
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,320
Or parties with pretty hood girls?

272
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,360
What about lethal injections?
What's your take on that?

273
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:10,330
Patrick puts his finger to his
lips and you obey,that how it works?

274
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,290
Woof.

275
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,480
detective.

276
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,100
I have young marty's
attorney here,annabelle shore.

277
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,670
Annabelle shore?

278
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,490
We know a girl with
that name,don't we,marty?

279
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,570
I'm her mother.

280
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,540
Do you all know each other?

281
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,650
What I know is that
marty's been released.

282
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,710
Unshackle him,please.

283
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,190
He assaulted a police officer.

284
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,600
I have witnesses who will testify detective
crews incited marty to those actions.

285
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,060
Okay,before he goes,do you think
marty could tell us where he was

286
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,380
when max horta found himself
dead at the bottom of this pool?

287
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,000
Go ahead,marty. You can tell them.

288
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,680
I was at my therapist'S.

289
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,240
At your therapist's all night?

290
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,510
I get bad nights. Terrors. Can't sleep.

291
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,920
Always have,ever since I was little.

292
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:59,360
When I have really bad nights,sometimes
I stay at dr. James' house.

293
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,020
That's where I was.

294
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:06,550
I will tell you that marty was
at my house all night that night.

295
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,550
But,really,that's all I will tell you.

296
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,280
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

297
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,010
Yeah,there's a lot of that going around.

298
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:17,010
Is it normal for doctors to allow
patients to stay at their house?

299
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,240
Each patient is an individual,so
the word "normal" does not apply.

300
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,290
If I were your
patient,could I stay over?

301
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,020
Sometimes I have bad nights.

302
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,930
- Did I say that out loud?
- Crews.

303
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,670
My partner thinks I say
everything that pops into my head.

304
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,620
Is that normal?

305
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,100
I think you should leave now.

306
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,000
Right,because there is
no such thing as normal.

307
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:40,470
Which is a relief,because
sometimes I don't feel normal.

308
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,310
Is it normal not to feel normal?

309
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,540
I'm sure some people find
you charming,detective.

310
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,550
I don'T.

311
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,340
How much do you charge an hour,doc?

312
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,920
My hourly rate is competitive.

313
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,370
$450 an hour?

314
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,220
For a 50-minute hour,yes.

315
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,210
How can it be an hour if it's 50
minutes? That's messing with time.

316
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,710
I do say everything
that pops into my head.

317
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,710
Maybe I should come back.

318
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,010
If I wanted to make an
appointment,who should I call?

319
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,690
You should call another doctor.

320
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,190
Rich parents,high-priced
lawyers,shrink's at $450 an hour.

321
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,120
Then you know what happens.

322
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:24,210
It's the chief on the phone,your name in the
paper,and you wishing it was a gang killing.

323
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,640
You go after a gang and miss,maybe they
shoot you,maybe you get 'em next time.

324
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,810
You go after one of these princes and
miss,you're doing traffic in time square.

325
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,580
So what am I saying to you,detectives?

326
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,750
You're saying don't miss.

327
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,700
Let's go talk to the alpha dog.

328
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,310
Un hotel.

329
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,310
Hotel gentil.

330
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,790
Un hotel.

331
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,750
Hotel gentil.

332
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,300
I'm not talking to you.

333
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,500
You just did.

334
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,630
Hotel gentil. Un hotel. hotel gentil.

335
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,380
hey,benny. Remember me?

336
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,840
Patrick tell you not to talk to us?

337
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,550
Well,it's patrick I want to talk to.

338
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,050
Learning french?

339
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,820
I want to live in paris some day.

340
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,600
With patrick?

341
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,300
Patrick? In paris? No,never.

342
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,980
Why not?

343
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,400
Patrick,he's L.A.

344
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,490
You've seen him. You
understand what I mean.

345
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,110
Do you know where he is now?

346
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,110
- Charging.
- Charging?

347
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,370
He says he needs it.

348
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,280
And where does he charge?

349
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,870
Out there on his bike.

350
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,200
Says he needs to feel the city.

351
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,440
and you believe that?

352
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,420
That he just drives
around L.A.On his bike?

353
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:44,990
Why would he
lie?Besides--

354
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,330
you can see it when he comes back too.

355
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,830
So alive. Lit up. It's like I said.

356
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,390
Patrick is L.A. You know?

357
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,560
- It's like if he weren't here
then-- - L.A.Wouldn't be here either.

358
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,950
is that why you want to go to paris?

359
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,230
Because it's not patrick?

360
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,240
I'd like you to look at something.

361
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,840
That's max horta.

362
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,900
He left behind a wife and two daughters.

363
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:16,620
Max horta? He's L.A.Too,annabelle.

364
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,030
Trace came back on that call max
got that sent him to that party.

365
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,340
It came from his daughter,carla.

366
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,750
Carla,do you recognize
any of these people?

367
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,400
I don't remember. I don't remember them.

368
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,600
I don't remember calling my papa.

369
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,590
My god. Oh,my god. Did I call him?

370
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,480
Did I call him,and then
he came,and then they--

371
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,270
can I ask you about
the girl,rachel seybolt?

372
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,400
Both you and charlie were close
friends with the murdered family?

373
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,190
They were our dear friends,yes.

374
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,000
And you were close with
the daughter rachel?

375
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,210
Yes.

376
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,680
Hey,rachel.

377
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,710
There's someone here to see you.

378
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,210
Rachel,honey. You remember me?

379
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,320
I remember you,rachel.

380
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:37,440
You used to brush my
hair. You remember that?

381
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,850
I had those gold shoes.

382
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,020
The party shoes,you used to call them.

383
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,670
It's okay.

384
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,570
We're just gonna sit
with you for a while then.

385
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,730
Open the door. Open the door.

386
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,370
- Back door.
- Got it. Right.

387
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,230
I remember this.

388
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,770
Oh,god. Oh,I remember that.

389
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:59,230
I can'T. I can't,charlie.

390
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,930
It's-- no,it's--it's his.
It's my husband's car.

391
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,130
I really gotta get a car.

392
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:34,000
You and your partner looking for me?

393
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,830
I've been watching you
train. Pretty intense.

394
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,560
Ex-addict work out,right?

395
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,880
Lots of anger. Anger's good.

396
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,770
Why don't you come down to the
station? We can talk about it.

397
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,540
Why don't you come on a
ride with me on my bike?

398
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,510
And we won't have to talk.

399
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,250
Do you really like talk?

400
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,870
Where would we go?

401
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,490
Out there.

402
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,110
What's out there,patrick?

403
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,720
Everything. All the time.

404
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,130
I'd really like for you to come
down to the station with me.

405
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,890
No.

406
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,400
That's not what you'd like.

407
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,270
he came to your gym?

408
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,380
I called. You didn't pick up.

409
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,610
Must have been in a canyon.

410
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,950
"Everything,all the
time." That's what he said.

411
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,690
That's what these kids
think they can have.

412
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,670
Everything,all the time.

413
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,780
Everyone works for them. Even us.

414
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,400
Even the shrink.

415
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,550
Dr. Lana james.

416
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,090
She works for them.
She's not one of them.

417
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,790
What?

418
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,670
Worm.

419
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:15,950
Didn't I tell you organic
fruit would kill you? Didn't I?

420
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,130
Worms are just protein,right?

421
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,800
Oh,please don't do that. Why would
you do that? What's wrong with you?

422
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,460
Dr. James? Come with me,please.

423
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,460
One of my patients was arrested?

424
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,860
That seems to be the case.

425
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,600
Do you know which one?

426
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,760
I'm sorry,ma'am,I don'T.

427
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:42,830
I was told one of my patients was
arrested and was asking for me.

428
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,260
I'd like to know who it is.

429
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,670
I'm just the new captain
around here,ma'am.

430
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,710
They don't like to tell me much.

431
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,080
But one of the detectives will
certainly know more. Please.

432
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,440
That's a crime board.

433
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,540
We use it to see the connections
between the suspects and the victims.

434
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,130
The victim's the dead man there.

435
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,000
See,there's the kind of con tctionshose kids
have that get you floor seats to laker games.

436
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:25,800
Mm-hmm,and there's the kind of connections
that we have that get you life in prison.

437
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,920
I'm on here. Why? Why
would i be on there?

438
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,080
Oh,come on,you're
smart,doc. You can see why.

439
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,940
Marty's connected to the dead man.

440
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,340
You're connected to marty.

441
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,340
When marty goes down for
max horta's murder,so do you.

442
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:44,050
are you ready for
that,doc? Life in prison?

443
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,870
You really think when it comes down
to it,they're gonna be there for you?

444
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:51,930
You're the help. Just like us.

445
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,140
I'm on here.

446
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,630
Marty wasn't with me that night.

447
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,680
I don't know where he was.

448
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:11,010
He wasn't with me.

449
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,750
Patrick asked me to lie.

450
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:14,140
Why would you do that?

451
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:16,900
You wouldn't understand.

452
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,200
Now what happens?

453
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,900
Now you get patrick to say it.

454
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,450
I think we should go in.

455
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,110
Just a-- just a quick
look. To supervise. Come on.

456
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,430
At least turn the cameras on.

457
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,910
Get a sketch artist up here?

458
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,970
You don't think very much
of me,do you,detective?

459
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,650
No,ma'am. I sure don'T.

460
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:55,210
But,like you said,I wouldn't understand.

461
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,040
I'm done. You can get dressed.

462
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,610
No smile tonight,dr. James?

463
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,980
Okay.

464
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,140
In fact,it's better.

465
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,620
We need to talk,patrick.

466
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,830
"We need to talk."

467
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,210
Is that that "professional" voice you
use when you're in session with annabelle?

468
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,220
I didn't know she saw annabelle too.

469
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,590
- no,this is serious.
- Okay.

470
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,340
I'll make you a deal.

471
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,840
You climb on for a little ride...

472
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,320
and then we'll talk.

473
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,970
- How little?
- I won't even turn the key.

474
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,810
the police came to question me.

475
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,000
No,use the professional voice.

476
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,700
How do you talk to annabelle?

477
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:04,910
You need to listen to me,patrick.

478
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,420
The police came to
question me about marty.

479
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,780
I don't think they believe me.

480
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,980
I believe you. I do.

481
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:17,240
I think that you are a
very believable woman.

482
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,930
Patrick,you need to take this seriously.

483
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,580
remember the last time we were here?

484
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,450
You liked the way I made you feel?

485
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,180
Tell me.

486
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,060
Tell me.

487
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,760
I liked the way you made me feel.

488
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:42,520
Oh,that's pretty good. He just
discredited her as a witness.

489
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,010
A shrink who's been having sex
with her patient's boyfriend.

490
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,730
How's that gonna play
out in front of a jury?

491
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,240
Everything,all the time.

492
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:53,570
No,no,no. Not yet. Don't get off yet.

493
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:01,950
Hey,crews,reese,I know you're out there.

494
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,650
You having fun? You like
to watch? Watch this.

495
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,200
Patrick.

496
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,830
I'd like to have heard
what he just said to her.

497
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:35,780
- How did she hear what he said?
- How did she hear?

498
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,470
He was practically on top of her.

499
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,270
No,not her down there.

500
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:44,520
How did max's daughter elsa hear?

501
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:47,930
How did she hear what her father said?

502
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:51,460
It would have been... too loud!

503
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,560
El ?

504
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:59,450
You lied to us,didn't you,elsa?

505
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:06,500
You didn't hear your father on
the phone that night,did you?

506
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,530
You couldn't have.

507
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,500
It was too loud.

508
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,420
Did you stay here when he left you?

509
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,410
You didn't stay,did you?

510
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:18,260
did your father get mad
when you disobeyed him?

511
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,000
Yeah? My father too.

512
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:23,870
He would get so mad when
I wouldn't listen to him.

513
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,660
But you wanted to make your
father happy,didn't you?

514
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:32,350
Me too. I wanted to make my
father happy,because he loved me.

515
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,700
Like your father loved you.

516
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:41,140
Did you leave here,elsa?

517
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,010
I followed my father.

518
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,730
And you saw something bad?

519
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,860
What did you see,elsa?

520
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:51,210
My father,outside that building.

521
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,370
Did you see anybody else?

522
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,050
A very big man.

523
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,620
what did the big man do?

524
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,260
He hit my father over and over.

525
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,360
My father was screaming.

526
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:05,070
But he kept hitting him.

527
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,370
Then my father stopped screaming.

528
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:13,280
Elsa,the big man,did you see his face?

529
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,380
elsa.

530
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,990
That's him! That's the one.

531
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,230
I didn't do what my father asked of me.

532
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,470
Now he's dead.

533
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,330
what kind of monster makes my daughters
think they killed their own father?

534
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,570
You tell me what kind.

535
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:36,330
He's not a monster. He's a punk.

536
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,220
Crews.

537
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,570
Dr. James?

538
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,430
He's in there. Something's wrong.
He's--he's not marty anymore.

539
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,650
He came here and I
could see it right away.

540
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,150
I could tell marty was gone.

541
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,950
Don't you guys have bigger guns?

542
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,540
Marty!

543
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,670
Marty!

544
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:21,410
- Reese,pop the clip!
- I got it!

545
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,740
You were supposed to help us.

546
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,300
He's dead.

547
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:52,270
"You were supposed to help us"?

548
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,340
You were seeing all of them,weren't you?

549
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,370
Even patrick.

550
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,260
You'll never get patrick.

551
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,720
Massive steroid overdose.

552
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,300
Someone pumped a solution into him with
20 times the potency of an average dose.

553
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,430
Mm,steroid hotshot.

554
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,320
Marty was a loose end. Patrick
was cleaning up the mess.

555
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,680
should I release the body?

556
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,620
Can you hold off on that?

557
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:27,140
Your buddy patrick put marty
on the slab there,benny.

558
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:34,310
No,that's a lie. We're friends.
We've al--always been friends.

559
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,930
Maybe you should tell marty
here that patrick's his friend.

560
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:40,060
But marty can't hear you,'cause
he's a little dead right now.

561
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,980
You can look all you want to,benny.
He's not gonna get any less dead.

562
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:47,150
If we just do what patrick tells
us to do,then it will all be okay.

563
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,120
It's not okay.

564
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,340
Benny,did you not do what
patrick told you to do?

565
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,180
Is that why it's not okay?

566
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,770
What happened at that party?

567
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,720
What did patrick tell you to do?

568
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,890
He told me to go with that girl.

569
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,860
Carla?

570
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,780
He told you to go where with her?

571
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:13,550
Into her room.

572
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,290
Patrick opened the door.

573
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,720
There she is on the floor,out of it.

574
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:18,900
What did he want you to do?

575
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,840
He told me that I could
do what I want with her.

576
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:25,660
Patrick had gotten me girls
before,but they were pros.

577
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:30,890
But that girl carla,she was real.

578
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,010
So you called her father.

579
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:40,000
After patrick closed the
door,I took her cell phone,

580
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,050
I speed-dialed the
number that said "dad,"

581
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:45,750
and then I told the dude that answered that his
daughter was in trouble. To come and get her.

582
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,190
Then I left the room.

583
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,820
And I got so drunk I couldn't think.

584
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,360
And what happened to max horta?

585
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,340
I guess marty took care of him.

586
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,580
And patrick took care of marty.

587
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,970
- You guess?
- I'm the clown.

588
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,750
I make patrick laugh,but
he doesn't tell me anything.

589
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,240
He knows I'm soft.

590
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,690
He knows not to trust me.

591
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,300
Who does he trust?

592
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,960
Annabelle.

593
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,140
He trust annabelle not to lie to him?

594
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,100
She'd never lie to anybody.

595
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,120
That's why patrick loves her.
That's why we all love her.

596
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,230
But she's gone.

597
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,950
I can't find her anywhere.

598
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,420
I can't find annabelle.

599
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,550
Did patrick kill her too?

600
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,320
Is there a problem?

601
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:04,090
The best thing about paris:
It's not L.A. Right,annabelle?

602
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:08,160
If L.A.Is patrick,then getting away
from L.A.Is getting away from him.

603
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,060
I didn't think you'd be cruel.

604
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,970
He is. Believe me.

605
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,850
Patrick told me about you.

606
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,010
He admires you.

607
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,800
Admires how you didn't lay down.

608
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:22,780
How you took it and made
a new life for yourself.

609
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:26,390
I'm gonna make a new life for myself.

610
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,220
Unless I'm under arrest.

611
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,480
We have nothing to hold you on.

612
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:32,870
No,you can go. Send me a postcard.

613
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,700
Just before you do go...

614
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:39,030
I want you to meet some people.

615
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:44,180
annabelle,this is carla and elsa horta.

616
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,800
Girls,this is annabelle.

617
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,490
patrick.

618
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,620
Where are you,annabelle?

619
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:03,080
At my house. Marty was just here.

620
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:07,010
Did you hear what I just said,patrick?

621
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,070
You said marty was just there.

622
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,750
It was bad,patrick. He's all messed
up. He said that you tried to kill him.

623
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:16,380
Annabelle,what are you doing?

624
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,560
Marty said that you tried to kill him.

625
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,420
He said that you gave
him some bad juice.

626
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:24,630
He's looking for
you,patrick. What's going on?

627
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:28,100
Annabelle,stay right
there. Hold on. Hello?

628
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,730
Patrick,what's going on?

629
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,460
What do you mean,benny?

630
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,810
With marty. Haven't you heard? He
was arrested. The cops have him.

631
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,980
I'm out of here,man. I'm going south.

632
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:41,550
Wet your bed until you
were seven years old?

633
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:46,720
Is that-- that's
late,right?

634
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,310
Where'd you get that?

635
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:52,630
Also says here that you
often feel like a fraud.

636
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,440
You told your therapist you
wanted to be more like benny?

637
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,030
How'd you get that?

638
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,200
"Because people know who benny
is,but no one knows who I am."

639
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,730
How'd you get that?

640
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,960
Your shrink gave it to me.

641
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,230
When she found out you tried
to kill marty,she gave us this.

642
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,650
That's a lie. You are lying to me.

643
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:20,890
Marty says you killed max horta.

644
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:27,390
You do that,patrick?

645
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,870
No,he did that!

646
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,630
And then he comes crying to me about it!

647
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,950
"What am I going to do,patrick? Help
me,patrick. I lost my temper,patrick."

648
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,480
Crying ldae a mn baby.

649
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:37,470
Marty says you tried to kill him too.

650
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,430
A hotshot of steroids?

651
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,940
Yeah,I jacked him up.

652
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,870
But guess what? It didn't kill him.

653
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,590
Yeah? But guess what? It did.

654
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,150
They think it's their city.

655
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,120
It's not. It's our city.

656
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:40,410
This car's just an object.
Objects have no meaning.

657
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,300
They don'T. They don'T.

658
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,990
You're a nut job. You know that,crews?

659
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,010
- What's with that car?
- It's just an object.

660
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,080
Doesn't have any meaning.

661
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,590
Even if it did,it'd be in italian.

662
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,130
So I wouldn't understand it anyway.

663
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,770
You gonna write me a ticket?

664
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:31,510
Like that bond trader
who's puttin' it to your ex?

665
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,530
I know hollis worked for you,jack.

666
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:38,790
Even if that were true,the proof would be in
my lapd file,which I heard has gone missing.

667
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,800
Yeah,I heard that.

668
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:46,220
Okay. You drive carefully now.

669
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:51,880
Oh,don't talk to ted anymore.

670
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:54,670
You make him nervous for some reason.

671
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:17,240
this is reese.******
