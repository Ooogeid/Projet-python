1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,110
Previously on life...

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,660
Is that Mark Rawls over there?

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,670
You know Mark Rawls, don't you, Arthur?

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,390
You told his son you
could get him out of jail.

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,220
And then you killed him.

6
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,190
Send me somewhere now, and I'll talk.

7
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,020
Start talking now.

8
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,390
I killed the kid.

9
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,490
The thing about Olivia, Charlie, is...

10
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,760
She's marrying your father.

11
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,940
She seems really nice. Really.

00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:30,660
<i>Chasing after the
world brings only chaos.</i>

14
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,970
<i>Allowing it to come to
be brings only peace.</i>

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,420
<i>Retreat from the world,
and it shall pursue you.</i>

16
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,660
<i>To exist, to allow the world to exist,</i>

17
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,390
<i>all things at once, all things as one.</i>

18
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,340
<i>This is the path to
serenity, to balance.</i>

19
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,010
<i>See yourself as part of the world...</i>

20
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,200
You having a moment?

21
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,490
I know every moment is now,
but now we're ten minutes late.

22
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,520
Did you feel that?

23
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,020
Does someone always have to say that?

24
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,070
I'm standing right next
to you. Yes. I felt that.

25
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,470
- It was an earthquake.
- it was a tremor.

26
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,060
Did you feel that?

00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,040

29
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:06,660
All right. Here's the
latest. Four freeways cut.50 fires.

30
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,590
Power grids and water
services out city-wide.

31
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Busted water mains.
Dorm collapse at L.A.U.

32
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,760
Now, according to this
lapd emergency manual,

33
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,390
county emergency operation center will be
calling us with our emergency assignments.

34
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,710
So buckle up. It's an emergency.

35
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,050
He's reading with his foot.

36
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,600
No, he's just using
it to turn the pages.

37
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,390
It must be his first earthquake.

38
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,040
Detective Crews.

39
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,260
Officer Danny Ritenour, state corrections
office. We're having a little emergency.

40
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,800
Yeah? Us too.

41
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,920
Yeah, well, that earthquake just
facilitated the escape of a prisoner

42
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,980
that you put away last
year, one Arthur Tins.

43
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,000
What happened?

44
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,830
He was on a work detail when the
earthquake hit, and tins got away.

45
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,880
He's in Los Angeles?

46
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,350
The mother of the
kids Tins killed--

47
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,590
I do have her address,
and we will notify her.

48
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,380
Good. She testified in the
penalty phase of tins's trial.

49
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,020
Now, is there anyone else
he'd wanna even things up with?

50
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,740
'Cause we have to contact these people.

51
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,940
Uh, no. Tins confessed. No one
gave him up. The victim's dead.

52
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,930
Okay. We're just trying to
cover every angle. Thank you.

53
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,550
Hey, have we spoken before?

54
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,930
I don't think so.

55
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,700
You have any connection to
the corrections department?

56
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,540
No, sir. Not anymore.

57
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,750
Good luck today.

58
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,090
Yeah, okay.

59
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,750
Should we tell him that's not a weight-bearing
wall and it won't do him any good?

60
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,350
Arthur Tins is not
gonna go after anyone.

61
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,020
That weasel's gonna find a rock
to hide under and stay hidden.

62
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,120
It's not a question of who
Arthur Tins is gonna go after.

63
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,420
It's a question of who's
gonna go after Arthur Tins.

64
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,390
Mark Rawls?

65
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,230
Paroled out three months ago.

66
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,520
I don't think I like what you're saying.

67
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,980
I don't think I like
what I'm saying either.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,230
You're saying we have to stop
Arthur Tins from getting killed?

69
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,950
Yeah. I guess we do.

70
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,200
Yeah. I guess we do.

71
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,020
Yeah, I guess you don'T.

72
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,410
Since when do you go by the book?

73
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,900
You don't even have
a regulation haircut.

74
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,960
I go by the book.

75
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,860
I go by this book, the
lapd emergency manual,

76
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,710
since about an hour ago when the earth opened
up and tried to swallow Los Angeles whole.

77
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,500
Besides, we have a lot
of things to do today.

78
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,340
And none of them are stopping
crimes that haven't happened yet.

79
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,480
Oh, god, this is it! Hold on,
everyone! It's the big one!

80
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,670
That's funny. Real funny.

81
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,380
Okay. No mug shots. Sorry,
lapd computers are down.

82
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,200
Arthur Tins. Low rent scam artist.

83
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:07,390
Last year, he killed the
10-year-old son of Mark Rawls.

84
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,930
Mark Rawls happened to be doing
ten years inside at the time.

85
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,850
Arthur Tins confesses to killing
Mark Rawls's 10-year-old son.

86
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,840
He gets life.

87
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,390
Yeah, I heard about that confession.

88
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,920
I heard Tins wasn't talking, and
then I heard two lapd detectives

89
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:26,530
that look a lot like you two took tins to go
see rawls in the joint he was doing his time in.

90
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,670
Tins took one look at the hard
case Rawls and sang like a bird.

91
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,010
- Is that what you heard?
- That's what I heard.

92
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,670
Rawls got paroled three months ago.

93
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,160
Tins escaped this morning, so
now they are both out there--

94
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,110
lapd computers are down.

95
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,650
The prison grapevine is not.

96
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,590
And by tonight, Arthur
Tins is gonna be dead.

97
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,700
Ooh, two psychos killing each
other. You know what that is?

98
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,550
That's a civic
improvement project, okay?

99
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:51,530
Like I said before, we're not the future crimes
unit, and we all have our assignments out there--

100
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,050
Even your very own Tidwell.

101
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,780
Oh, well, how is Tidwell gonna get his assignment
out there if Tidwell can't leave his doorway?

102
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,440
Tidwell is working on it.

103
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,420
And as for you two, today...
you're on foot patrol.

104
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,390
Hold on!

105
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,470
Did you feel that?

106
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,990
Tidwell said foot patrol.

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,660
We just happen to be patrolling
the street where Mark Rawls lives.

108
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:52,480
How do you get over something like that?

109
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,270
Someone like Tins killing your son?

110
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:59,180
You sit in your cell every day, think about
what you'd do to Tins if you ever got the chance.

111
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,580
And that gets you over it?

112
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,720
Call for backup. We're gonna
take Rawls in when we see him.

113
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,570
Maybe you should, uh...
Button up a little.

114
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,420
Button up?

115
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,170
You know, we're goin' into a
building full of violent ex-offenders.

116
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,240
You ever see the cartoon where
the wolf is staring at the lamb,

117
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,070
but what he really sees is lamb chops?

118
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,680
Lamb chops.

119
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,370
Very kind of you two to stop by...

120
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,260
to see how I came through the quake.

121
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,390
Always a pleasure to see you.

122
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,160
You want some mint jelly with that?

123
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,060
As you can see, I'm doing all right.

124
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,280
Nothing structural.

125
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,790
I'd think there'd be a lot of
people out there needing your help.

126
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,710
Like Arthur Tins?

127
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,730
Oh, Arthur Tins is a guest of
the great state of california.

128
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,100
What kind of help could he
possibly be needing, detective?

129
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,850
Tins escaped. This morning.

130
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,430
He's out.

131
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,070
- No. Not angry enough. Try again.
- What?

132
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,680
We come here to tell you the man who
killed your son has escaped from prison,

133
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,220
and you go with, "he's out."

134
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,020
You're lying to us.

135
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,150
How were you planning on
spending your day today, Mark?

136
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,220
I did you a favor.

137
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,800
Now you do me one and
walk away from all this.

138
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,140
Okay. I'll do you a favor.

139
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,520
My partner's gonna take her
gun out for this next part.

140
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,200
You know the drill.

141
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,720
You should walk away.

142
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,960
He put a bullet in my son.

143
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,700
It's my job on the street
to die. You should walk away.

144
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,740
Yeah. There is a lot of things
I should do.

145
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:57,990
California penal code 12021 is a
person who has been convicted of--

146
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,930
He killed my son!
What would you do, huh?

147
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,090
You know what you'd do.

148
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,440
No killing today, all right, Mark?

149
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,770
Why not? Nothing else to do.

150
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,270
Get up.

151
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,170
All right, central's not processing
new prisoners 'cause of the quake.

152
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,620
So book him in Valley division
and forward me the paperwork.

153
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,310
We have an assignment to get back to.

154
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,340
- I guess you really are a cop.
- I guess I am.

155
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,490
You had to do it.

156
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,840
Doesn't mean I have to like it.

157
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,870
Oh, come on. Go direct traffic...
it'll make you feel better.

158
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,430
It's Tins!

159
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,120
Is he okay?

160
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,100
What are you thinkin'?

161
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:46,160
I'm thinking that when I woke up today I
wasn't thinking that I'd have to kill somebody.

162
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,280
Now you think you have to?

163
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,510
No. Now I think I want to.

164
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,540
Okay, see, as your commanding officer, I hear
something like that, I have to take your weapon.

165
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,440
So it's a good thing I didn't hear that.

166
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,060
When did Tins get so smart?

167
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,530
Prison gives you a lot of
time for self-improvement.

168
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,710
Yeah, prison.

169
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,190
You go in afraid of your own shadow,
and you come out a full-blown psycho.

170
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,970
They all come out
worse than they went in.

171
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,030
Well, maybe not everyone.

172
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,430
Yeah, but how did Tins find us?

173
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:30,510
Location status check. D-247,
400 block. Alvarado street.

174
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,410
Our call for backup.

175
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,750
Tins heard it off the radio.
We told him where Rawls was.

176
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,230
We thought we were trailing
him, he was trailing us.

177
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,680
Wait a minute.

178
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:42,410
How'd he even know you were gonna
go see Rawls in the first place?

179
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,750
State corrections didn't even know
tins escaped until ten minutes ago.

180
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,470
Well, if they didn't know Tins escaped,
then who called us this morning?

181
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,070
- Tins.
- Must have been.

182
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,910
He called to tell us so
we'd lead him to Rawls.

183
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,330
No Tins, but we found
his state prison jumpsuit.

184
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,020
It was stuffed in the
garbage can downstairs.

185
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,740
So he's still dressed like a cop.

186
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,600
Perfect disguise, especially
with the city going to hell.

187
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,690
This is it? No more clothes?

188
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,600
No. Why?

189
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,210
Because Tins wasn't alone.

190
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,860
Corrections says he escaped from
that work detail with two other men--

191
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,330
A Leonard "Crete" Debs
and a Donnie Wayne Johnson.

192
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,730
When did this get here?

193
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,730
"Thanks for making me the
man I am. Arthur tins."

194
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,880
So now he's out there somewhere
with these two knuckleheads.

195
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,600
Any thoughts as to where out there?

196
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,340
Known associates from his file?

197
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,050
Problem is, all closed case
files are computerized now.

198
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,720
Yeah, and what with the quake, the
police computers are still down.

199
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,330
What about a living
file? Wasn't Tins married?

200
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,670
Ex-wives are a beautiful thing,
but how are we gonna find her?

201
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:49,800
If only we had a really big book that listed
everybody's names, addresses, and phone numbers.

202
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:54,600
Dude, you are old-school.
I'll roust one up.

203
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,770
Charlie! Yeah-- yes. Oh,
yes, I-I-I sure did. Yeah.

204
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:07,010
Yeah, it was quite something.
Listen, I-I need to ask for--

205
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,590
no. Y-you know what? No,
never mind. It's--it's fine.

206
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,260
I-I was really just
calling to see how you were.

207
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,460
Yes. I'm fine. Yeah, yeah.

208
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:24,070
Just... have a pencil in my hand.

209
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:49,460
It's Ted. Yeah. Yeah. How are you?

210
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:54,730
Oh, I sure did feel it over here. Yes!

211
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:00,780
Problem, uh... yeah. S-sort of.

212
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,160
<i>The greatest mistake is to be
continually fearful of making one.</i>

213
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,520
All the other cars were
out on quake patrol?

214
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,370
Yes, crews. That's right.

215
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,160
<i>A stumble may prevent a fall.</i>

216
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,100
Besides, my car goes faster.

217
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,740
Yes, Crews, that's right.

218
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,660
But why are you driving?

219
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,350
That's one of your zen questions, right?

220
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,580
One you don't really want an answer to?

221
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,840
<i>To say that we are alive.</i>

222
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,040
<i>When we cease to make mistakes, that
is the moment when we cease to be.</i>

223
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,190
<i>The buddha was asked if
he ever made mistakes--</i>

224
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:42,190
<i>He answered, "I am
making a mistake--"</i>

225
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,170
<i>even now.</i>

226
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,900
<i>Nothing more.</i>

227
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,490
This is actually kinda
awesome. Watch your back!

228
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,310
Thanks for seeing us, Mrs. Tins.

229
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,240
Ms.Ehrlich.

230
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,590
I don't use Tins since the divorce.

231
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,490
Anything I can do to hurt
arthur, I'm happy to help.

232
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,550
So you don't particularly
miss your ex-husband.

233
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,550
I've had cramps I miss
more. Shoot him on sight.

234
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,650
You need me to chip in
for bullets, just ask.

235
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,200
And your son wouldn't miss his father?

236
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,330
As far as my son is concerned,
his father is already dead.

237
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,740
We need a list of your
ex-husband's friends or associates,

238
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,420
anybody he'd go to
if he were in trouble.

239
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,210
Arthur has no friends.

240
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,140
His associates are lowlifes
with names like spider and itchy.

241
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,430
They smell like bad meat.

242
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,390
Any idea where they work?

243
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,690
When they work, it's in porn stores as clerks
so they can steal people's credit card numbers.

244
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:52,440
Or they're installing satellite tvs in people's
homes so later they can go back and steal them.

245
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,550
Real bunch of winners. All of 'em.

246
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,690
But you want names, addresses? Gimme
some paper. I'll make you a list.

247
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,130
It'll be therapeutic.

248
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,120
There are over 50 names on this
list. We've gotta narrow it down.

249
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:12,580
No problem. We just need to talk to the one
person who knows the most about Arthur Tins,

250
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,890
Even more than his ex-wife.

251
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,350
Who would that be?

252
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,630
His cellmate.

253
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,780
Olivia. Thank you for coming.

254
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,940
Of course, Ted. What is it?

255
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,700
I was hoping that maybe you
could drive me to the hospital.

256
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,190
It's not bleeding much, so we
don't have to worry about your car.

257
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,430
Or we could take my car, but
you'd probably have to drive,

258
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,250
because I have a, uh, pencil in my hand.

259
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,510
Ted. They just announced
it on the radio.

260
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,320
There's a 24-hour wait
at all the area hospitals.

261
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,730
You have officer Mc Shane on the line.

262
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,210
I have Arthur Tins'
cellmate in front of me.

263
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,190
His name is Carl Rossbarrow.

264
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,590
Tins was always talking
about the getaway,

265
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:01,250
how everybody in prison spent all their time
figuring out the score but half-assing the getaway.

266
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,180
Tins wanted to figure out something that was
the score and the getaway rolled into one.

267
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,560
Now do me a favor-- when you catch
Tins, don't arrest him, just kill him.

268
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,240
Arthur's all about the getaway.

269
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,650
Anybody on that list good at getaways?

270
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,520
Uh, there's a guy named
Chip. Says he's a driver.

271
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,520
- Have you killed Arthur yet?
- No, not yet.

272
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,540
I saw the caller I.D.,
And I got all excited.

273
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,000
We had a question about your list.

274
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,940
Chip. He's a driver?

275
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,220
Anything with an engine.

276
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,800
You have any idea where we
might find Chip these days?

277
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,920
Last I saw him, he was
working some secure car job.

278
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,570
- Like armored car?
- Yeah.

279
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,190
That would appeal to Arthur.

280
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,150
Yeah, the score and the
getaway rolled into one.

281
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,640
Ma'am, do you know what
company chip worked for?

282
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,830
Yeah, it had a raccoon on
the patch holding a pistol.

283
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:54,930
A raccoon?

284
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,090
It might have been a badger. I
don't know. Just do me a favor?

285
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,680
Call me back when Arthur's dead.

286
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,410
A badger? With a pistol?

287
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,270
I'll run a trace on Chip, but...

288
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,050
but all the police computers are down.

289
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,710
All the police computer systems
were built by the lowest bidder.

290
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,680
What we need are other computers.

291
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,570
What we need is blended coffee drinks.

292
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,180
Just... work the phone.

293
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,320
What do you do for a living?

294
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,150
Assistant buyer, nordstrom's. Why?

295
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,750
You're my deputy now.

296
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,300
- For real?
- This is an emergency. I need your help.

297
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,700
I need you to google armored
car companies in the L.A. area.

298
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,600
W-what can I do?

299
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,220
- Blended coffee drinks?
- Sweet.

300
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,870
- Deputy.
- That's right.

301
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,620
You think I could get a certificate?

302
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:17,970
- Did you feel that?
- Yes, I did. Thank you for asking.

303
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,640
What is that?

304
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,760
- It's a gun.
- He's a cop.

305
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,950
He's my deputy.

306
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,280
Okay.

307
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,470
Must be nice, pretty girls
falling into your lap like that.

308
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,570
Any luck with those
armored car companies?

309
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,900
Got a badger with a pistol?

310
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,630
No, but this one...

311
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,570
has a bear with a shotgun.

312
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,900
Did you want a muffin too?

313
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,890
Hello, Arthur.

314
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,170
How ya doing?

315
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:00,040
I think you just dislocated
my shoulder there, pally.

316
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:03,490
Yeah? If you're lucky,
I'll pop it back in.

317
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,450
Oh, yeah? If you're lucky,
maybe I won't kill you.

318
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,280
Where's your partner, arthur?

319
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:14,290
I don't know. He should
be around any minute now.

320
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,520
Please!

321
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,620
Do what they say, or they'll kill me!

322
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,500
That's true. You should listen to her.

323
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,620
He'll kill her.

324
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,160
He wants to.

325
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,870
Chip, drop the gun. Let her go.

326
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,630
That's not gonna happen.

327
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,190
Know why? 'Cause today is my day.

328
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,480
And if I want her to die on my day,
Chip there's gonna kill her for me.

329
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,810
I made a promise to Mark Rawls that
I'd get you back to prison, Arthur.

330
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:52,250
Yeah? I don't think so.

331
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:56,080
See, I don't feel that institution
has anything more to teach me.

332
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,050
You gonna uncuff me?

333
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,900
Wanna point those guns
to the left, please?

334
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,550
That's right... left.

335
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,550
That's a great getaway
car. Or follow car.

336
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,960
So I want you to shoot it up for me.

337
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,440
- You want us to shoot the--
- the car!

338
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,860
That pretty I-talian car.

339
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,780
I want you to put some
po-lice lead into it.

340
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:10,320
Now!

341
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,510
Not bad!

342
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,140
Now, I know you got more to give me
than that. I want you to get some!

343
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,740
Now!

344
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,080
Wanna get some! Get some!Get some,
get some, get some, get some, get some!

345
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:39,430
Wanna get some, get some! Get some,
get some, get some, get some, get some!

346
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,230
Wanna get some. Get
some, get some, get some.

347
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:52,700
You don't feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it,
can you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

348
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,780
Gimme the baby. Start the car.

349
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,920
Shoot me, I'll shoot her.

350
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,860
They broke in.

351
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,750
Chip Lanter and this other guy, Tins.

352
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,580
Chip's been here two years.

353
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,930
You all right?

354
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,100
He's a good driver.

355
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,090
Is there an electronic trace on this
truck we can use to track his movement?

356
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,600
Yes, of course.

357
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,330
It's not coming up.

358
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,790
Chip must have disabled
the transponders.

359
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,640
That car could be anywhere.

360
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,310
I'm really more of a
leave it in kind of guy.

361
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,690
I've always heard pull it out.

362
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:45,680
Always? What about a corkscrew
or-or a stingray barb ?

363
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,830
It's not a corkscrew. It's a pencil.

364
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,590
And it's a day's wait at the
E.R., So it's coming out right now.

365
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,480
You are so... lucky, Olivia.

366
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,820
Why is that?

367
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,500
Well, to be so sure of things.
I used to be sure of things.

368
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:10,030
I can't imagine ever
being that way again.

369
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,090
That's just the pencil talking, Ted.

370
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,180
You're gonna... take it out, huh?

371
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:22,540
All we need is some alcohol.

372
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,930
Not rubbing alcohol. Drinking alcohol.

373
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:29,580
Now, what goes with a
yellow number 2 pencil?

374
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,130
I did it!

375
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,040
Always knew I'd get out. Get
you... get this armored car.

376
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,080
Then the quake hits, and
everyone runs to the atms.

377
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,760
But the atms run dry.

378
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:58,040
So the bank needs to get all that
extra cash out to the panicked populace.

379
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:01,550
That's a miracle,
Chip. A seismic miracle.

380
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:06,090
You know what the best part is?
They gonna load it up for us.

381
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,640
- Like a
drive-through. - Yeah.

382
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,380
Like a drive-through.

383
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,940
detectives.

384
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,540
There's something you should see.

385
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,600
Chip Lanter's personal security beacon.

386
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,070
All the guards carry one.

387
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,230
He's calling us for help.

388
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,570
- Why would he do that?
- where is he?

389
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,490
Looks like somewhere in the valley.

390
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,110
- You're it?
- I'm it.

391
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,860
Swat's camped out in front of the federal building
in anticipation of some sort of civil unrest.

392
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,810
And apparently, the national
guard's off somewhere else.

393
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,500
so it's just us.

394
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,940
Yeah, but I'm pretty pissed off.

395
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,460
who is it?

396
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:22,700
My guess... that's Arthur Tins.

397
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,710
Chip was the driver.

398
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,810
Never really got to use his getaway car.

399
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:31,810
Yeah, looks like things didn't
work out like he expected.

400
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,000
Okay. All right. Yeah.

401
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,780
All right, dispatch says since
these two here are pretty well dead,

402
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,020
it's gonna be awhile before
they can send anybody over.

403
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,450
They're stretched pretty thin today.

404
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,980
All right, so they
disagree about the cut.

405
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,130
They start shooting at each
other, and one of the shots...

406
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,690
hits the car's gas tank?

407
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:54,670
Looks that way.

408
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,470
Yeah, but you think
that's what happened?

409
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:59,080
No. I just said it looks that way.

410
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:02,570
Because you really have to be aiming if
you want the gas tank to explode like that.

411
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,670
You really would.

412
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,910
And you really can't tell
if that's Arthur Tins or not.

413
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,040
You really can'T.

414
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:10,980
You know, he could have burned up half the
cash and still walked away with a fortune.

415
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,470
he really could have.

416
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,190
But Tins is smart.

417
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,900
Why do such a bad job
at faking your own death?

418
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:21,850
Maybe he doesn't want
us thinking he's dead.

419
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,310
Well, what does he want?

420
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,520
He wants the next people
to think he's dead.

421
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,090
The next people?

422
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,360
Bobby, don't! Don't
move! Bobby, don't move!

423
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,870
Don't move, okay? Bobby, don't move.

424
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,400
Tins needs a bigger mess.

425
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,270
He needs more bodies.

426
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,790
Wait a second.

427
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,890
There.

428
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:05,960
- I open that door...
- something goes boom.

429
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,460
okay. All right?

430
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,360
Pull your hand away from the door.

431
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:16,010
Okay. Walk away.

432
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:24,520
Charlie, I'm... I'm stuck. My
watch is, uh, tangled on the line.

433
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,880
All right. Okay, don't
move. I'm gonna cut it--

434
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,770
no. I'll cut it.

435
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:32,610
I'm the commanding officer
here. Give me the knife.

436
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,740
Step back. Now, detective, give
me the knife. Now stand back.

437
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:51,610
You know, I always had a desire to be
standing next to jessica alba when I died.

438
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,040
I get that.

439
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,600
You pull the handle...

440
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:12,040
the wire pulls the trigger...

441
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:18,110
and... boom! Gas goes up.

442
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,650
He wanted the next people
to think he was dead.

443
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,400
Yeah, the ones who came to clean us up.

444
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,600
That's why he invited
us along here today.

445
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,580
Okay, so where is Arthur Tins now?

446
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,640
- Tins left her behind.
- Who?

447
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,720
June Brimmer.

448
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,540
The president of the armored car
company. They left her behind.

449
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,100
Maybe they didn't wanna
bring her with 'em.

450
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,650
But what good is a hostage if
you don't take 'em with you?

451
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,410
Why did Tins leave her behind?

452
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,200
Maybe...

453
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,660
tins didn't disable the
armored car's transponder.

454
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,750
Maybe Brimmer told us he disabled it.

455
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:51,600
Maybe tins left brimmer behind 'cause he didn't
want the lapd to go looking for that armored car.

456
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,510
Maybe you two should go
pay a visit to june brimmer.

457
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,740
Stark and I will
babysit the bacon. What?

458
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:01,090
Think I'd leave you here
alone with all this cash?

459
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,770
- You have a pencil in your hand.
- I do.

460
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:12,660
But you know, now that I look
at it, you can hardly notice it.

461
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,470
Really, maybe it's not so bad.

462
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,160
Maybe I'm going to have a glove made.

463
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,080
A special glove to fit the pencil.

464
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,070
You're not having a special glove made.

465
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,270
You're having the pencil
taken out of your hand.

466
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,160
Ah, but maybe now you've had too
much to drink to pull out the pencil.

467
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,520
Are you kidding me?

468
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,560
I pull pencils better this way.

469
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,830
Are you ready?

470
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,000
- Olivia...
- Ted...

471
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:54,600
you know, when I, uh, woke up
at the bottom of the stairs...

472
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,410
and I saw... this...

473
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:03,960
it was not Charlie that I
thought of calling first.

474
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,150
Ted.

475
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:09,400
Don't say it's the pencil talking,
because it's not the pencil talking.

476
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,510
It's me talking.

477
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:17,000
- I wanted to call you, Olivia.
- Ted...

478
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,540
I'm marrying Charlie's father.

479
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,970
Yeah.

480
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:26,130
Why haven't you yet?

481
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,990
It's not the pencil talking.

482
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:38,360
It's not... the pencil talking.

483
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:43,410
- Ted...
- Yes?

484
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,990
I'm so sorry.

485
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,510
- Don't be. Don't be.
- Not for this.

486
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,140
For this.

487
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,210
Detectives.

488
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,010
Hi, June. How are you feeling?

489
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:35,130
Okay. Just... spending
time with my family.

490
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,730
You like music, huh?

491
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:42,890
we're more about
old-school stuff. Beatles.

492
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,870
I really like their second movie.

493
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,530
Yeah?

494
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,030
Yeah.

495
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,880
Okay, well, we'd just like
to ask you some questions.

496
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:55,020
You know, if you could come
by the office tomorrow...

497
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,490
that'd be great.

498
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,940
Thank you.

499
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,470
You're welcome.

500
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:05,240
the Beatle's second
movie was Help, you moron.

501
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,500
Hey, June, why don't
you show our guests in?

502
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,160
Come on in. Sit down.

503
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,380
Hey, you doing okay there?

504
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:31,560
Of course Simon's okay.

505
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,600
You're okay.

506
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,870
Why don't you let Simon come
and stand over here by me?

507
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,920
Oh, I don't know. Maybe after dinner.

508
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,880
Where's your partner?

509
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,680
She should be here any minunute.

510
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,710
Call for backup?

511
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,660
Gonna get the swat all
set up on the perimeter?

512
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:54,450
You came here this morning,
took over the house, set up camp.

513
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:55,830
You should get in on this.

514
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,650
I mean, you can't have
any of the crunchy part,

515
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:01,020
but she'll scoop you up some of the
gooey stuff in the middle if you want.

516
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,270
Won't you, cupcake?

517
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:07,710
I know what you wanted to happen
to us in that warehouse, Arthur.

518
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,090
I'm sorry about that.

519
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:11,400
- I'll live.
- Maybe.

520
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,470
Or maybe I'll kill you.

521
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,810
Why don't you show me
your other hand, arthur?

522
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,580
See, it'd be better for all concerned
if your partner would come on in here.

523
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:32,980
No. It'd be better for all concerned
if your partner were to come on in here.

524
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,200
Is there someone else in here?

525
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,860
You leave someone here, Arthur?

526
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,750
Leave someone while
you were out and about?

527
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:52,670
Come on! Don't be shy now.

528
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:03,430
Now you get to see
something really good.

529
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,840
Dude, you didn't tell me
there was macaroni and cheese.

530
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,570
Dude.

531
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:34,230
Crete was just keepin'
Mr. Mom company upstairs.

532
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,730
He'd been crying.

533
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:40,680
A son shouldn't have to
see his dad like that.

534
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,340
Take him to the car, crete. We're goin'.

535
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:47,860
Actually, why don't you
stay here with us, Crete?

536
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:51,160
How you doing? Where you been?

537
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:54,620
What's the matter, honey, no swat?

538
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,700
I forgot. Major seismic disturbance.

539
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,530
And you and your
understaffed police force--

540
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:04,780
now, if I could
vote, which I can't--

541
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,180
I vote
yes--more cops.

542
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,610
Just so you know.

543
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:13,450
Now... we're going for
a little family drive.

544
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,640
I'd invite you all-- this
family's got a big old suv--

545
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,180
but there's already a bunch of us going.

546
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,810
Now, I was gonna take off tonight
and leave in the dark, you know,

547
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:26,990
but I suppose we should go right now
before the gas prices get any higher.

548
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:31,880
Crete? You know Chip is dead?

549
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,550
Yeah, that was the plan. Kill Chip.

550
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,530
- What about the other guy?
- What other guy?

551
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,870
- Hey, Crete.
- Donnie Wayne Johnson.

552
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,220
The third man you two
escaped with. Where is he?

553
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,670
Hey, crete!

554
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:45,310
They're trying to trick you, mess
with your head. You ignore them.

555
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:49,370
He'd be right if there was no third
man, but there was a third man.

556
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:53,390
You... and Arthur, and Donnie
all busted out this morning.

557
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,120
- What did Arthur do with Donnie?
- Crete, go to the car.

558
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,620
Arthur killed donnie...

559
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,600
and used his body to fake his death.

560
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,900
Crete, go to the car!

561
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:03,010
Arthur... where's Donnie, man?

562
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,800
On his way back from the warehouse.

563
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,040
Well, he'd be back by now.

564
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,230
But he's not comin' back, is he, Arthur?

565
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,830
he kills his partners, Crete.

566
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,630
Donnie, Chip, you sooner or later.

567
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,640
My guess is sooner.

568
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:21,200
Arthur, where is donnie?

569
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:24,690
Crete, as god is my
witness, we are a team.

570
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,410
Why don't you go ahead
and give him a call?

571
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,470
Call him on the phone, Crete.

572
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,970
Go ahead, give Donnie
a call just to say hi.

573
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,720
Arthur! Where is Donnie?

574
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,970
He's at the
warehouse--

575
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,610
What...

576
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,880
you kill me?

577
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:15,740
I can't kill you, Arthur. Remember?

578
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:19,360
You're already dead.

579
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,080
Oh, yeah. Okay.

580
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,650
I'll see you later then, crews.

581
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,610
What are you sitting on?

582
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,520
Earthquake kit.

583
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,660
I can live out of this
thing for five days.

584
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,300
Water, radio, blankets, food.

585
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:11,730
It's got a seat.

586
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,330
So after you empty out the
bucket, you can use it as a toilet.

587
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:20,650
You stepped up to a car full of
explosives, but earthquakes scare you?

588
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,740
The earth cracking
open-- that I don't get.

589
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,870
Messed up things people do...

590
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,030
that, detective, I
understand. Don't you?

591
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:46,040
This isn't even a weight-bearing wall.

592
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,640
- What?
- What?

Did you feel that?
