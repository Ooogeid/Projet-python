1
00:00:00,122 --> 00:00:02,029
Previously on life...

2
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:06,113
Yeah, i have the interview
with the dean from the business school.

3
00:00:06,114 --> 00:00:07,424
It's for a teaching position.

4
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:09,937
You asked my husband
permission to have sex with me?

5
00:00:09,938 --> 00:00:12,522
He punched me, then you slapped me.
Maybe we're even?

6
00:00:12,523 --> 00:00:13,961
It's just that she won't speak.

7
00:00:13,962 --> 00:00:16,762
It's not physical... she
could speak if she wanted to.

8
00:00:16,763 --> 00:00:18,847
There was six. There is five.

9
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:20,993
There are five officers
in this photo, ted.

10
00:00:20,994 --> 00:00:23,032
- There could just as easily be four.
- Be four.

11
00:00:23,033 --> 00:00:25,544
That's a threat, charlie.
Against jack reese.

12
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:27,723
Who are you afraid of, jack?

13
00:00:31,388 --> 00:00:34,496
There was six. There is five.

14
00:00:34,497 --> 00:00:37,237
There could just as easily be four.

15
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,419
There was six. There is five.

16
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:45,885
There could just as easily be four.

17
00:00:49,497 --> 00:00:52,107
James frances dunn.

18
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:55,145
Went through the academy
with jack reese.

19
00:00:55,271 --> 00:00:58,333
Committed suicide 1988.

20
00:00:58,334 --> 00:01:00,389
That's what the newspaper said.

21
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:03,059
- You don't believe them?
- Newspaper said i was guilty.

22
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,868
Yeah... said i was guilty too.

23
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:07,557
Ted, you were guilty.

24
00:01:07,558 --> 00:01:11,822
I know, but it still hurt
to see it there like that in print.

25
00:01:17,206 --> 00:01:19,502
Where you gonna start?

26
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,793
With the woman.

27
00:01:25,613 --> 00:01:28,155
Thanks for seeing me, mrs. Dunn.

28
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:29,783
Of course.

29
00:01:29,962 --> 00:01:32,941
You said you were looking
into jimmy's death?

30
00:01:33,357 --> 00:01:37,052
The police report said his gun
discharged when he was cleaning it?

31
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:40,739
Well, that was because
of the pension.

32
00:01:40,877 --> 00:01:43,242
If it had said the other,

33
00:01:43,243 --> 00:01:45,060
There would have been no pension.

34
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:46,844
I understand.

35
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:49,818
But everybody knew what it meant.

36
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:53,464
At the funeral...
all the cops knew.

37
00:01:57,668 --> 00:02:00,648
The force went over this years ago.

38
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:03,167
Why come around and ask this now?

39
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,564
Do you remember these men?

40
00:02:06,964 --> 00:02:09,588
No, i don't.

41
00:02:10,694 --> 00:02:13,987
I'm afraid i don't remember
much about that day.

42
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,938
Maybe i can help you.

43
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:21,748
That man there,
his name is jack reese.

44
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:23,947
No.

45
00:02:25,127 --> 00:02:28,722
- That wedding ring you wear...
- It's the one jimmy gave me.

46
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:33,648
Oh, it's not real.

47
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:36,940
It's wax. It's not real.

48
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:03,017
Lots of feeling here.

49
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:06,168
All these cars were once brand new.

50
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:09,196
A lot of these cars were
someone's very first car.

51
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:11,242
Remember your first car?

52
00:03:11,243 --> 00:03:14,145
Yeah, it cost $300
and smelled of cat piss.

53
00:03:14,146 --> 00:03:16,327
- Did you have a cat?
- No.

54
00:03:16,328 --> 00:03:18,699
I remember my first car.
God, i loved that car.

55
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,585
Maybe a little too much.

56
00:03:20,586 --> 00:03:22,926
That's a really flat car.

57
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,108
What do we got?

58
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:34,427
Is that a...

59
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:36,009
Yeah.

60
00:03:38,146 --> 00:03:41,330
- What about that stuff up there?
- I think that's him too.

61
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:44,148
- And that stuff up there?
- Him too.

62
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:46,281
Gonna open it up now.

63
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:54,090
If he was lucky, he was dead
when he went in there.

64
00:04:01,306 --> 00:04:03,697
Yeah, if he was lucky.

65
00:04:06,968 --> 00:04:11,342
Life 205 synchro : flolo

66
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:17,616
- You knew the victim? Mike?
- Mike brody.

67
00:04:17,776 --> 00:04:20,263
He's, uh, one of our drivers.

68
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:23,124
College kid.
He lucked into a union card.

69
00:04:23,282 --> 00:04:25,496
What was he doing in there?

70
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,444
- We're curious about that ourselves.
- Hey, i stopped the crusher

71
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:32,571
As soon as i saw
what was in there. I called the cops.

72
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,701
Look, i just take the cars
off the line and i crush 'em up.

73
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:38,876
- Who puts the cars in the line?
- I do.

74
00:04:39,776 --> 00:04:43,064
- And you are?
- I'm rob dow.

75
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:46,741
I'm the dispatcher here.
I put that car in line.

76
00:04:46,742 --> 00:04:49,820
- You check if the cars are empty?
- Yeah, when they come in.

77
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:52,023
All right, we're gonna need
statements from all of you.

78
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:53,896
And i'm gonna need an address
for mike brody.

79
00:04:53,897 --> 00:04:55,563
- Can you get me that?
- Sure.

80
00:04:55,564 --> 00:04:58,611
I think he just moved in
with his girlfriend, rosa.

81
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:01,963
Yes?

82
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:06,484
Ma'am, do you know a mike brody?

83
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,759
- Why, has something happened?
- May we come in?

84
00:05:15,242 --> 00:05:17,593
- Ma'am.
- I don't wanna hear it.

85
00:05:17,594 --> 00:05:19,281
I don't wanna hear
what you have to say.

86
00:05:19,282 --> 00:05:21,078
Ma'am, this is happening.

87
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:24,399
It's happening whether you
close this door on us or not.

88
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:31,205
You had just moved in together?

89
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,146
A few months ago.

90
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:35,535
Mike and i were engaged.

91
00:05:37,692 --> 00:05:40,134
Was he having trouble with anyone?

92
00:05:42,904 --> 00:05:46,512
- You think someone murdered mike?
- We're looking into everything.

93
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:50,464
- What about the people at work?
- No. Everyone liked him.

94
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,768
Rosa?

95
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,445
What is it?

96
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:02,112
Probably nothing.

97
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,989
Probably nothing, but,
well, tell us anyway.

98
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,412
Just to be sure.

99
00:06:07,135 --> 00:06:09,950
In this last month, at night,

100
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:11,988
When mike thought i was asleep,

101
00:06:11,989 --> 00:06:14,676
He'd go to the garage,
lock the door.

102
00:06:14,677 --> 00:06:16,412
Almost every night.

103
00:06:16,413 --> 00:06:18,425
Did you ever ask him about this?

104
00:06:18,426 --> 00:06:21,483
No. I thought he was nervous.

105
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:23,302
Because the wedding...

106
00:06:23,303 --> 00:06:25,735
I thought men need their space.

107
00:06:25,975 --> 00:06:27,697
I never asked.

108
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:30,510
I thought men need their space.

109
00:07:03,484 --> 00:07:05,015
Who is that?

110
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:08,620
Who the hell is that?!

111
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,328
Mike brody.

112
00:07:10,404 --> 00:07:12,044
The squashed guy.

113
00:07:12,045 --> 00:07:14,565
Crushed. Crushed guy.

114
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:17,189
Been in the car for about a day, dead,
before the crusher got him.

115
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,389
We got a positive i.D.
Off dental records.

116
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,494
So crushed guy,
weeks before his wedding,

117
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:24,396
Decides to go into the garage
and do a little online thing with...

118
00:07:24,397 --> 00:07:28,491
According to these i.M.S he saved,
a girl who calls herself bethany.

119
00:07:28,492 --> 00:07:31,982
They met in a chat room.
"Strangers seeking strangers.

120
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:33,485
What's with the nudie pics?

121
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,750
They were playing a game.
She sent him a piece of herself

122
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:37,682
Each time he did something for her.

123
00:07:37,683 --> 00:07:39,746
Something? Like what something?

124
00:07:43,393 --> 00:07:46,249
Why in heaven's name
would you want to do this by yourself?

125
00:07:46,305 --> 00:07:48,404
I'm not saying you
would want to do this at all,

126
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:49,809
But if you were to do this,

127
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,823
Why would you do it
by yourself, am i right?

128
00:07:51,882 --> 00:07:54,457
He didn't think he was by himself.
He thought he was with her.

129
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,893
Well, let me tell you something,
there is no her.

130
00:07:56,954 --> 00:07:58,825
And there is no bethany, okay?

131
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:01,154
There is a 13-Year-Old member
of the marching band

132
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:03,615
With an online account
and a social disorder.

133
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,392
- You played the...
- Trombone. And i was good.

134
00:08:06,393 --> 00:08:08,989
Let's look for a suspect
in the real world, shall we?

135
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,997
What about the girl?
Did she know what mikey was up to?

136
00:08:11,998 --> 00:08:14,595
- Didn't look like it.
- Engaged for about a month.

137
00:08:14,596 --> 00:08:16,741
She was spending the night
at her sister's.

138
00:08:19,218 --> 00:08:22,074
"Why would you want to be
with that fat cowboy?"

139
00:08:22,517 --> 00:08:24,212
Fat cowboy?

140
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:27,532
"If that's what he told you
he looks like, it's not true.

141
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:30,023
"He's not slim. He's not athletic.

142
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:32,348
"He doesn't have blue eyes
or blond hair.

143
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:34,474
He's lying to you, bethany."

144
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:37,244
I think we need to go back
to the wrecking yard.

145
00:08:37,978 --> 00:08:40,424
You wanna know
what he really looks like?

146
00:08:40,425 --> 00:08:43,728
He must weigh 300 pounds.
Mud-Brown eyes.

147
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:46,151
He's balding under that hat.

148
00:08:46,187 --> 00:08:48,402
He's not tall, and he's ugly.

149
00:08:48,426 --> 00:08:51,091
Why would you want to be
with that, bethany?

150
00:08:51,092 --> 00:08:53,451
Why would you want to be
with someone like...

151
00:08:53,452 --> 00:08:56,210
Rob. Why don't you stand away
from the desk for us?

152
00:08:56,211 --> 00:08:57,642
Hey, rob,

153
00:08:57,643 --> 00:09:00,324
If that's bethany,
tell her i say hello, okay?

154
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,371
He's on me.

155
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:12,444
- Reese?
- Crews, get him off.

156
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:14,631
Get him off of me! He's on me!

157
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:16,886
How 'bout you get off my partner?

158
00:09:18,212 --> 00:09:21,041
Okay, uh, first day...

159
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:22,679
No problem.

160
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,983
Nobody shows up, i'll deal with it.

161
00:09:24,984 --> 00:09:27,862
Every rejection is a step forward.

162
00:09:27,863 --> 00:09:30,724
Just get to "yes."

163
00:09:37,906 --> 00:09:40,353
This is... quite the turnout.

164
00:09:42,026 --> 00:09:44,130
This is the right classroom?

165
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:47,199
"A practical introduction to
effective business practices"?

166
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,628
Yes? Great.

167
00:09:49,652 --> 00:09:51,880
Uh, good morning.

168
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,219
My name is ted earley.

169
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,954
As in the early bird, but...

170
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,103
With an "e"...

171
00:10:00,443 --> 00:10:02,120
Between...

172
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:04,617
The...

173
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,540
"L" and the...

174
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:09,558
The "y."

175
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:11,994
Okay, we've got a long way to go,

176
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:15,492
So let's start
with a simple question.

177
00:10:16,645 --> 00:10:19,524
What is business?

178
00:10:19,657 --> 00:10:21,666
Uh, yes, miss.

179
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:24,177
Is this class gonna be graded
or pass/fail?

180
00:10:27,325 --> 00:10:30,591
So, what... is...

181
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:33,967
What is business?

182
00:10:33,975 --> 00:10:36,258
The answer is everything.

183
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:38,687
Everything is business.

184
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:41,460
Every historical event, every war.

185
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:44,002
Every decision made
by every government.

186
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,420
Any book stocked or sold.

187
00:10:47,421 --> 00:10:50,470
From the moment that eve
first decided

188
00:10:50,471 --> 00:10:54,098
To accept delivery of that apple

189
00:10:54,099 --> 00:10:56,179
From that snake,

190
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,091
We have been engaged in...

191
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:02,833
Business.

192
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,882
- I don't like getting sat on, rob.
- She doesn't.

193
00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:11,754
You know, you did a good job
trashing your computer.

194
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,799
But we got guys in the basement,

195
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,853
All they do is
pull stuff off computers.

196
00:11:15,854 --> 00:11:18,365
Pulled some pretty good stuff
off of yours.

197
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:20,397
You know, you'd probably like
a job like that.

198
00:11:20,398 --> 00:11:22,744
Down there in the dark,
just you and a computer.

199
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:24,128
Wanna talk about bethany?

200
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:27,105
- Please don't say her name.
- Why not? It's a pretty name.

201
00:11:27,106 --> 00:11:28,814
It's not for you to speak it.

202
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:31,157
What about mike? Could he speak it?

203
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,594
We got mike's computer.

204
00:11:32,595 --> 00:11:34,679
Mike and bethany were going
at it pretty hard.

205
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:38,204
- Stuff that made my partner blush.
- Stuff i've never even heard of.

206
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:40,773
You and bethany, though,
from what we read,

207
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:42,665
Didn't really get into that.

208
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:45,931
Seems like you and bethany
were just friends, though. Right, rob?

209
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:47,741
I've got guys in my life like that.

210
00:11:47,742 --> 00:11:50,803
Just friends kinda guys.
It's a little sad.

211
00:11:50,804 --> 00:11:52,768
She sent you stuff like,

212
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:55,348
"If you saw me, would you know me?

213
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,088
I look for you wherever i go."

214
00:11:58,089 --> 00:11:59,556
It's nice, i guess.

215
00:11:59,557 --> 00:12:01,506
Not like the stuff she sent mike.

216
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:06,354
Bethany never sent you
anything like this, did she?

217
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:15,196
It's okay, rob. You can look.

218
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,541
Hey, rob...

219
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:21,585
I know you've got a secret.
Won't you share it with me?

220
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:27,833
The secret you and bethany
were i.M.Ing when we walked in?

221
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:30,911
I'll read your part, rob.

222
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:33,909
"You don't have to worry
about what happened."

223
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,213
- What happened, rob?
- "It's your secret, bethany.

224
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,813
Now it's mine.

225
00:12:37,814 --> 00:12:40,841
- No one else will know."
- Are you covering for bethany?

226
00:12:40,842 --> 00:12:43,229
Because that's what we call
being an accomplice to murder.

227
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,982
"Just tell me one thing.

228
00:12:44,983 --> 00:12:47,002
Tell me that you love me."

229
00:12:48,123 --> 00:12:50,419
My partner will read this part.

230
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,810
- I...
- You shut up.

231
00:12:53,811 --> 00:12:56,051
You do not say those words.

232
00:12:56,052 --> 00:12:57,823
That is not for you to say.

233
00:12:57,824 --> 00:13:00,442
Bethany was sending mike
pictures like this, and not you?

234
00:13:00,443 --> 00:13:02,700
Never you, and still
you're gonna defend her?

235
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:04,320
Strangers seeking strangers.

236
00:13:04,321 --> 00:13:06,064
You met her there first. Then what?

237
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:09,140
You brag to mike,
mike goes online, then takes her away?

238
00:13:09,549 --> 00:13:12,529
Mike brody got up in her head.

239
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:14,648
He confused her.

240
00:13:14,955 --> 00:13:17,966
He could do that,
but she figured it out.

241
00:13:18,988 --> 00:13:22,268
She figured him out completely.

242
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,657
What happened that night, rob?

243
00:13:24,658 --> 00:13:26,447
I can't tell you.

244
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,035
It's a secret.

245
00:13:39,578 --> 00:13:41,778
You find who was
on the other end of these i.M.S,

246
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,107
You find this bethany. Then
you go through the looking glass

247
00:13:44,108 --> 00:13:45,522
And you bring 'em back here.

248
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:47,194
We already talked
to the geeks in sex crimes.

249
00:13:47,195 --> 00:13:49,310
They said it would take
a few days, low priority.

250
00:13:49,311 --> 00:13:51,250
Well, hold him
until you get that trace.

251
00:13:51,251 --> 00:13:52,619
On what charge?

252
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,853
On the charge
of freakin' me the hell out.

253
00:13:54,874 --> 00:13:57,777
We have everything we need
to find bethany right here.

254
00:13:57,778 --> 00:14:00,083
If we need to figure out
where bethany is,

255
00:14:00,084 --> 00:14:02,974
We need to figure out who bethany is.
And who bethany is is in here.

256
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,044
Well, bethany is not gonna be that.

257
00:14:05,117 --> 00:14:08,000
No, maybe not.
But bethany is in there.

258
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:10,056
We just gotta find her.

259
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,429
- What are we looking for?
- Anything that seems real.

260
00:14:13,496 --> 00:14:16,148
Anything that's mentioned
more than once.

261
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,926
Tennis.

262
00:14:18,062 --> 00:14:19,442
- Got it.
- Got it.

263
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:22,680
Ocean breezes.

264
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,108
Got it. Wait, wait...

265
00:14:25,326 --> 00:14:28,128
Uh, no, no. Ocean breezes.

266
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,040
- Junior in college?
- Yep.

267
00:14:34,295 --> 00:14:36,085
You got this?

268
00:14:37,851 --> 00:14:40,174
No, i'm pretty sure i don't.

269
00:14:41,482 --> 00:14:43,395
Is it funny every time?

270
00:14:43,526 --> 00:14:45,261
I think it might be.

271
00:14:48,145 --> 00:14:50,356
"Went to school in l.A."

272
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,355
"Wanted to stay close to home."

273
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:54,508
"Was on campus,
but living at home now."

274
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:56,178
"Played two years for my school."

275
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:57,924
"Played two years
until i had to stop."

276
00:14:57,925 --> 00:14:59,067
"Living at home now."

277
00:14:59,068 --> 00:15:01,210
"Played two years
until i had to stop."

278
00:15:01,211 --> 00:15:04,033
- "Until i had to stop."
- "Until i had to stop."

279
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:06,243
She's from l.A.
Went to schools in l.A.

280
00:15:06,244 --> 00:15:08,474
Check the tennis squads
of all the local colleges.

281
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:11,019
- Go back a few years.
- Got a listing for a bethany.

282
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,869
Got a home address.

283
00:15:24,931 --> 00:15:27,719
Hi. Can i help you?

284
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,784
We're looking for bethany.

285
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:31,749
You found her.

286
00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:40,176
Through the looking glass.

287
00:15:48,264 --> 00:15:50,122
Enjoying your job?

288
00:15:50,123 --> 00:15:52,415
I am just a humble public servant.

289
00:15:53,711 --> 00:15:56,253
Oh, you're the police.

290
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,435
We need to ask you some questions.

291
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:01,942
Mom, the police are here.

292
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:03,718
You want some lemonade?

293
00:16:04,054 --> 00:16:05,526
Mom!

294
00:16:05,574 --> 00:16:08,287
The police are here!

295
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,494
She'll be right down.

296
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:15,891
I told 'em about all the coke
and hookers in the pool house.

297
00:16:16,171 --> 00:16:18,030
I'm so sorry about that.

298
00:16:18,464 --> 00:16:21,552
Hi, i'm detective crews.
This is detective reese.

299
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,286
Are you here...

300
00:16:23,453 --> 00:16:25,257
Is this about my daughter?

301
00:16:25,258 --> 00:16:27,754
- Yes, we'd like to talk to you about...
- I'm sorry.

302
00:16:27,755 --> 00:16:30,661
Here. My husband.

303
00:16:30,662 --> 00:16:32,392
He handles these things.

304
00:16:32,393 --> 00:16:34,659
Put the phone anywhere
when you're done.

305
00:16:35,974 --> 00:16:37,778
What just happened?

306
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,220
I was just about to ask you
the same thing.

307
00:16:43,394 --> 00:16:45,813
I hear...music.

308
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:53,675
It's a new cd
we have coming out next week.

309
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:55,505
It's nice, isn't it?

310
00:16:55,543 --> 00:16:58,286
So now, detective, maybe you can
tell me why you were at my house.

311
00:16:58,287 --> 00:16:59,612
Mr. Gray, we have reason to believe

312
00:16:59,613 --> 00:17:02,771
Your daughter bethany might have
been involved in a murder.

313
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,253
Involved?

314
00:17:04,254 --> 00:17:06,416
Involved exactly how?

315
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,374
There was an online relationship.

316
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,967
- Two online relationships, in fact.
- Online?

317
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:13,017
So you don't know
who it is, do you?

318
00:17:13,018 --> 00:17:15,022
We know it ended up like this.

319
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:20,720
Not exactly the kind of picture
you're used to, mr. Gray.

320
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:23,886
You have no idea
what i'm used to, detective.

321
00:17:23,887 --> 00:17:26,453
There's another man involved:
rob dow.

322
00:17:26,454 --> 00:17:28,090
Both were tow truck drivers.

323
00:17:29,238 --> 00:17:31,343
They're tow truck drivers?

324
00:17:32,324 --> 00:17:36,096
My bethany would never be involved
with tow truck drivers.

325
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:38,521
Mr. Gray, when we showed up
at your house,

326
00:17:38,522 --> 00:17:41,279
Your wife wanted to know
if it might be about your daughter.

327
00:17:41,431 --> 00:17:43,326
Has bethany been in trouble before?

328
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:45,203
She's not in trouble now.

329
00:17:45,787 --> 00:17:49,477
My bethany is a good girl.
She lives at home.

330
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,732
Sounds to me like
you're looking for a bad girl.

331
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:54,788
You know, i know bad girls.

332
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:56,606
In my business...

333
00:17:57,984 --> 00:18:00,348
Oh, i know a lot of bad girls.

334
00:18:01,722 --> 00:18:03,974
My bethany isn't one of 'em.

335
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,511
"I know bad girls."

336
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,971
Yeah, i'll bet he knows bad girls.

337
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:13,288
Do men have to be
disgusting? I mean

338
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:15,679
Isn't there, like, an operation
you guys can get?

339
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,510
I think they're working on a pill.

340
00:18:17,511 --> 00:18:20,228
What did those transcripts say
about where bethany lived?

341
00:18:20,696 --> 00:18:23,346
Uh, "was on campus,
living at home now."

342
00:18:23,347 --> 00:18:25,302
What about the tennis?

343
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:28,305
"Played two years,
and then i had to leave."

344
00:18:28,306 --> 00:18:31,019
Let's go see
why bethany left school.

345
00:18:31,786 --> 00:18:34,178
Maybe she's not such a good girl.

346
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:38,465
Bethany's name is listed on the
lease here, but she lives at home?

347
00:18:38,466 --> 00:18:41,062
We split the rent here before
her dad pulled her out of school.

348
00:18:41,157 --> 00:18:43,139
Do you know her dad knows bono?

349
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,914
Why did her dad
pull her out of school?

350
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,925
Because of what happened
with her professor.

351
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,691
His wife kinda walked in,
and they were kinda on his desk?

352
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:51,058
Stop.

353
00:18:51,317 --> 00:18:53,435
She's got problems.

354
00:18:53,888 --> 00:18:56,736
- What kind of problems?
- Her dad.

355
00:18:56,981 --> 00:18:59,240
He's always telling her
stuff he shouldn't.

356
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:02,063
- What kind of stuff?
- Like what a tough guy he is.

357
00:19:02,087 --> 00:19:03,966
The groupies he used to bang.

358
00:19:03,967 --> 00:19:05,742
And what happened to the professor?

359
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:07,027
Oh...

360
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:09,241
He walks with a cane now.

361
00:19:10,808 --> 00:19:14,156
Nathan gray...
born nathan gratowitz.

362
00:19:14,157 --> 00:19:16,420
A few possessions, convictions,
some assault beefs.

363
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:20,062
Now he runs gray scale music.
Now he's all clean.

364
00:19:20,063 --> 00:19:22,890
His daughter bethany has got
a little jacket too.

365
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:26,192
Duis, driver's license
suspended, probation.

366
00:19:26,255 --> 00:19:27,687
And then last year she goes off

367
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:29,745
And has an affair
with her humanities professor.

368
00:19:29,746 --> 00:19:32,167
- What kind of an affair?
- Online and in bed.

369
00:19:32,168 --> 00:19:35,321
When nathan reads the emails between
his daughter and her teacher,

370
00:19:35,322 --> 00:19:37,318
He takes bethany's computer away,

371
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:40,502
- He takes a bat to the teacher's knees.
- Paid him to drop the charges.

372
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:43,857
If bethany's back online
and her father finds out...

373
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:47,957
Wow, there really is a bethany.

374
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:50,429
I've gotta rethink a lot of things.

375
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:52,063
Press nathan.

376
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:07,438
Excuse me. Excuse me!

377
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:10,048
Oh... oh, detective.

378
00:20:10,191 --> 00:20:12,451
You know, i thought
you might come back.

379
00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:14,006
What, you took a look at my jacket

380
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:16,385
And thought you'd like
another poke at nathan?

381
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:21,594
Well, if you want to talk
to me, you go through them.

382
00:20:22,856 --> 00:20:24,468
Bodyguards?

383
00:20:24,469 --> 00:20:25,862
Lawyers.

384
00:20:33,674 --> 00:20:35,341
He does that.

385
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:43,789
Studying for your orals?

386
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:56,117
- When was this taken?
- Last year.

387
00:20:56,351 --> 00:20:58,196
She was so messed up.

388
00:20:58,241 --> 00:21:00,672
An athlete blasted all the time.

389
00:21:00,788 --> 00:21:02,797
It was all over the web.

390
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,116
Her dad based a cd cover on it.

391
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,234
Yeah. Messed up.

392
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,429
Even if he does know bono.

393
00:21:21,931 --> 00:21:23,768
You could have just sent the key.

394
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:26,987
- Not everything in there is yours.
- Why, you don't trust me?

395
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:40,769
I didn't know
what to do with it, so i just kept it.

396
00:21:42,872 --> 00:21:46,466
Hard to believe everything we had
fit into this tiny space.

397
00:21:46,467 --> 00:21:48,380
Well, not everything.

398
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,835
Hey, there's my drunken clown.

399
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,709
There they are.

400
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:05,487
I've been looking for these.

401
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,694
I got a new case today.

402
00:22:09,774 --> 00:22:12,503
Some record producer guy.

403
00:22:12,504 --> 00:22:15,487
Got me thinking
about my old albums.

404
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,438
Got me thinking
about a lot of things.

405
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,591
Yeah, i remember that.

406
00:22:21,732 --> 00:22:24,684
- What?
- You used to talk to me about the job

407
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:26,938
- When you came home.
- Sorry.

408
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:28,496
It's okay.

409
00:22:28,629 --> 00:22:31,581
And not all of these albums
are yours.

410
00:22:31,582 --> 00:22:33,525
This one was mine.

411
00:22:33,526 --> 00:22:34,818
And this one.

412
00:22:35,427 --> 00:22:37,395
And that one was yours.

413
00:22:37,396 --> 00:22:39,615
That was not mine.
I would never listen to that.

414
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,348
Not only did you listen to it,

415
00:22:41,349 --> 00:22:43,920
But you listened to it
over and over again.

416
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,704
That's our bed.

417
00:22:51,387 --> 00:22:54,037
Yes...it is.

418
00:22:56,006 --> 00:22:57,742
But, uh...

419
00:22:58,129 --> 00:23:00,329
We're not gonna think about that.

420
00:23:00,687 --> 00:23:02,013
No?

421
00:23:03,811 --> 00:23:05,916
We're not gonna think about that.

422
00:23:07,913 --> 00:23:11,043
We're not gonna think
about me kissing you.

423
00:23:11,044 --> 00:23:16,779
No... we're not gonna think
about you kissing me.

424
00:23:19,391 --> 00:23:21,564
We're not gonna think about me...

425
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,713
- Touching you.
- No.

426
00:23:24,762 --> 00:23:26,908
We're not gonna think about you...

427
00:23:27,163 --> 00:23:29,546
Touching me.

428
00:23:30,106 --> 00:23:32,225
I'm not thinking about it.

429
00:23:33,743 --> 00:23:35,765
Neither am i.

430
00:23:43,141 --> 00:23:45,245
Lock up when you're done.

431
00:23:58,216 --> 00:24:00,649
Yeah. Yeah, i know.

432
00:24:21,742 --> 00:24:24,712
- One, that's inappropriate.
- Why?

433
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,502
Because you're my boss. And two...

434
00:24:26,503 --> 00:24:28,662
If you read my file, you'd see
that i was in the program.

435
00:24:28,663 --> 00:24:30,873
- Why would i read your file?
- Because you're my boss.

436
00:24:30,941 --> 00:24:33,305
I don't like files. Too wordy.

437
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:35,986
Come on. So we'll get a fake beer.

438
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:38,133
And maybe we'll get fake drunk

439
00:24:38,134 --> 00:24:40,326
And end up having
fake drunk sex, what do you say?

440
00:24:40,327 --> 00:24:42,348
I'd say that idea's repulsive.

441
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:46,024
Those are the very first words
each of my three wives spoke to me.

442
00:24:48,209 --> 00:24:51,147
And they all changed their minds.

443
00:24:52,639 --> 00:24:54,826
It's twisted.

444
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:58,043
He gets some model to play
his daughter on an album cover.

445
00:24:58,044 --> 00:25:01,040
It'll make me buy it, but it's
well and truly twisted.

446
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,786
We've been looking for someone
obsessive and violent.

447
00:25:03,787 --> 00:25:05,432
You want to go see nathan.

448
00:25:05,433 --> 00:25:07,207
Nathan's all lawyered up.

449
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:09,225
Then let's go see nathan's girls.

450
00:25:09,373 --> 00:25:13,563
Okay, so, maya, why are you
in this class?

451
00:25:13,564 --> 00:25:15,251
I'm taking every class.

452
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:18,537
You're taking every class
in the business school?

453
00:25:18,538 --> 00:25:22,575
By the time i graduate,
i'll have done exactly that. Yes, sir.

454
00:25:22,842 --> 00:25:26,482
Wow. O... okay. What about you...

455
00:25:26,577 --> 00:25:29,749
- Vairam?
- I have a top secret business plan.

456
00:25:29,805 --> 00:25:32,771
Are... are you gonna be
working on it in the class?

457
00:25:32,772 --> 00:25:35,941
- Yes.
- Great, well, why don't we discuss...

458
00:25:35,942 --> 00:25:37,897
I will not discuss my business.

459
00:25:37,898 --> 00:25:40,990
It is a secret business. Move on.

460
00:25:43,033 --> 00:25:46,923
Uh, well, that just leaves you, ed.

461
00:25:46,924 --> 00:25:48,799
I'd like to learn
how to do that thing

462
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,128
Where if somebody tells you
it's in the constitution

463
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:54,530
That you don't have to pay taxes,
then you don't have to pay taxes.

464
00:25:54,818 --> 00:25:57,237
That's not in the constitution.

465
00:25:57,238 --> 00:25:59,452
Wesley snipes did it.

466
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:02,619
Yeah.

467
00:26:03,753 --> 00:26:04,866
Hey.

468
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,213
- I'm on my way out.
- Nice car.

469
00:26:08,593 --> 00:26:11,941
Bethany, you ever see what happens
when a car goes through the crusher?

470
00:26:12,394 --> 00:26:15,182
Ever see what happens when
a man goes through the crusher?

471
00:26:15,183 --> 00:26:18,628
It kind of looks like
strawberry jelly or lasagna.

472
00:26:18,629 --> 00:26:21,045
Or strawberry jelly and lasagna.

473
00:26:23,506 --> 00:26:25,624
Is that supposed to shock me?

474
00:26:25,926 --> 00:26:27,716
I've seen it before.

475
00:26:27,717 --> 00:26:30,740
- Plenty of times.
- It's not you, but it's you.

476
00:26:30,815 --> 00:26:33,973
- Like i said, i'm on my way out.
- I'll go with you.

477
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:37,097
Yeah, okay. Whatever.

478
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,415
Come on.

479
00:26:43,652 --> 00:26:45,839
Good. All right.

480
00:26:46,685 --> 00:26:48,639
You used to be a singer?

481
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,382
Looked you up.

482
00:26:50,466 --> 00:26:53,499
You know, you had
that one album out, and then nothing.

483
00:26:53,948 --> 00:26:56,222
It's how you and your husband
met, though, right?

484
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:57,917
In the recording studio?

485
00:26:57,918 --> 00:27:00,375
Hey, how come you stopped singing
after you got married?

486
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,320
Nathan didn't like it?

487
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:05,340
I stopped singing
because i wanted to.

488
00:27:05,341 --> 00:27:07,194
To raise my daughter.

489
00:27:07,195 --> 00:27:10,884
Ah, bethany, yeah.
Lovely girl. Strong swing.

490
00:27:13,496 --> 00:27:16,270
Bethany, did you go online
to get away from your father?

491
00:27:16,271 --> 00:27:18,597
I wasn't online. It wasn't me.

492
00:27:18,598 --> 00:27:21,278
I stopped drinking.
I stopped doing that.

493
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,918
- I'm in the real world now.
- If it wasn't you online,

494
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,128
Then the person
we're looking for is not you.

495
00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:28,379
Any idea who's not you, bethany?

496
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,128
That could be anyone.

497
00:27:30,129 --> 00:27:32,921
Well, the things
they knew about you, i...

498
00:27:32,922 --> 00:27:35,176
I think it's closer to home.

499
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:39,952
Maybe you want to ease up a little.

500
00:27:42,385 --> 00:27:44,545
You spend a lot of time
with these kids?

501
00:27:44,546 --> 00:27:46,622
Yes. They need me.

502
00:27:46,658 --> 00:27:49,078
Nothing wrong
with being needed, is there?

503
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,895
What about computers, lynn?

504
00:27:50,896 --> 00:27:53,205
Can you think of anybody
who would need one of those?

505
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:56,859
You're saying someone out
there is pretending to be me?

506
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,085
Someone i know.
And because of that...

507
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:05,627
Someone is dead.
You know, i tried to be good.

508
00:28:05,628 --> 00:28:08,418
I came home. I left that world.

509
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:10,404
I'm in the real world now.

510
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:13,849
- I am. I am.
- You are?

511
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,924
Okay, yes, you are!

512
00:28:17,638 --> 00:28:19,852
You know your husband
is prone to violence.

513
00:28:19,853 --> 00:28:21,798
And his relationship
with your daughter?

514
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,826
I mean, if he thought bethany
was online again...

515
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,811
Nathan was with me. Our club dance.

516
00:28:26,812 --> 00:28:29,736
I really have to get back to work.

517
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:31,961
You miss it?

518
00:28:31,962 --> 00:28:33,527
Singing?

519
00:28:37,911 --> 00:28:40,248
I never even think about it.

520
00:28:40,249 --> 00:28:43,533
Someone close to me.
Someone who knows me,

521
00:28:43,534 --> 00:28:46,389
Out there pretending to be me.

522
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,499
Someone like...

523
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,778
Bethany, slow down.

524
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,208
Maybe you can drive now.

525
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:20,661
Reese, how'd it go?

526
00:29:20,988 --> 00:29:23,399
My guess, both of nathan's girls

527
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,868
Are gonna take a hard look
at daddy.

528
00:29:27,062 --> 00:29:29,085
Why do you need a ride?

529
00:29:29,604 --> 00:29:31,831
Did you lose another car?

530
00:29:53,406 --> 00:29:54,559
Crews.

531
00:29:54,728 --> 00:29:57,434
Detective crews? She's speaking.

532
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,286
Excuse me?

533
00:29:59,287 --> 00:30:01,870
Rachel. She is speaking.

534
00:30:36,371 --> 00:30:38,106
Hello, jack.

535
00:30:43,022 --> 00:30:46,069
How come every time you come around

536
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,774
- Somebody ends up getting hurt?
- What are you doing here, jack?

537
00:30:48,794 --> 00:30:50,980
He came to say good-Bye.

538
00:30:56,743 --> 00:30:58,847
So now you're the one not talking?

539
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:05,555
You take care of yourself, kid.

540
00:31:08,903 --> 00:31:10,231
Jack!

541
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,496
You know where she is,
but you didn't tell 'em?

542
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,379
How come you didn't tell 'em
where she is, jack?

543
00:31:23,752 --> 00:31:26,048
You've been protecting her
from them?

544
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,964
I've always been protecting her.

545
00:31:36,379 --> 00:31:39,058
You've gotten in too deep,
haven't you, jack?

546
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,549
Maybe i can help you get out.

547
00:31:44,592 --> 00:31:46,710
Not for nothing, jack.

548
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:50,935
"It was six. "It is five.

549
00:31:50,936 --> 00:31:53,259
But it could just as easily
be four."

550
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,500
Who set me up, jack?

551
00:31:55,678 --> 00:31:57,400
Yeah, okay.

552
00:31:58,044 --> 00:32:01,484
I'm a lot of things,
detective crews, but i'm no rat.

553
00:32:01,485 --> 00:32:02,782
Who are they, jack?

554
00:32:02,783 --> 00:32:05,937
I do want to thank you for finding the
man that killed that girl's family.

555
00:32:05,938 --> 00:32:07,509
For putting him away.

556
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,589
But ever since you
got out of jail, crews,

557
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:13,159
All i've been doing
is cleaning up your mess.

558
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,263
But it's your mess.

559
00:32:15,264 --> 00:32:17,007
So you can clean it up.

560
00:32:31,503 --> 00:32:32,887
Reese.

561
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:35,201
Crews.

562
00:32:38,732 --> 00:32:40,290
Bethany.

563
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,573
Since you talked to my mother,
she hasn't stopped crying.

564
00:32:57,685 --> 00:32:59,763
Why is she crying, bethany?

565
00:33:01,116 --> 00:33:03,628
Because there were two hours
at that party

566
00:33:03,629 --> 00:33:06,214
Where my mother
couldn't find my father.

567
00:33:08,793 --> 00:33:10,857
She's so scared.

568
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,830
Nathan has no alibi.

569
00:33:13,996 --> 00:33:15,841
Let's go pick him up.

570
00:33:15,842 --> 00:33:18,355
Did my father kill that man?

571
00:33:22,024 --> 00:33:24,211
I just googled you.

572
00:33:24,775 --> 00:33:27,754
You were in jail.
You looted pension funds.

573
00:33:28,503 --> 00:33:30,826
I wouldn't put it like that.

574
00:33:30,827 --> 00:33:32,596
How would you put it?

575
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,341
Yeah...

576
00:33:37,073 --> 00:33:41,392
I did things i'm not proud of.

577
00:33:41,393 --> 00:33:43,187
And i did my time.

578
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:47,276
But before all of that,
i was a good businessman,

579
00:33:47,478 --> 00:33:50,649
And i made a lot of money
for a lot of people.

580
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:53,752
So you're saying
what you did was okay?

581
00:33:54,262 --> 00:33:55,724
No.

582
00:33:56,647 --> 00:33:57,973
No.

583
00:34:01,188 --> 00:34:06,819
What i'm saying is
that business is a system,

584
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,805
And i know how it works.

585
00:34:09,826 --> 00:34:13,776
And if any of you would like
to learn how it works,

586
00:34:13,777 --> 00:34:17,331
Then you will pick up
your pencils right now

587
00:34:17,543 --> 00:34:20,563
Or get the hell
out of my classroom.

588
00:34:20,983 --> 00:34:24,044
We have computers, not pencils.

589
00:34:24,186 --> 00:34:26,550
There was no mention of pencils.

590
00:34:26,551 --> 00:34:28,774
Will we be needing pencils?

591
00:34:41,854 --> 00:34:43,645
Gimme a minute?

592
00:34:51,061 --> 00:34:53,148
Mrs. Dunn, you want to see me?

593
00:34:54,814 --> 00:34:57,807
He wasn't cleaning his gun,
detective crews.

594
00:34:57,808 --> 00:35:00,115
But it wasn't the other, was it?

595
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:03,804
Jimmy swore
he would never leave me.

596
00:35:03,805 --> 00:35:06,177
I don't see how it could have been.

597
00:35:09,247 --> 00:35:11,966
His name is mickey raybourn.

598
00:35:11,967 --> 00:35:13,793
I don't know these other men, but

599
00:35:13,794 --> 00:35:17,624
This one... mickey raybourn.

600
00:35:27,026 --> 00:35:31,160
- You got a temper, nate.
- Yeah. Yeah, i do

601
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:33,962
Makes me real good at my job.

602
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,693
Real good in other places too.

603
00:35:36,694 --> 00:35:39,454
Don't talk to me like i'm one of
the groupies you used to bang.

604
00:35:39,726 --> 00:35:42,172
Used to. Not anymore.

605
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,401
You're a family man now,
right, nate?

606
00:35:44,402 --> 00:35:46,860
Got a wife and a daughter.

607
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:50,687
Are you out there online
pretending you're something

608
00:35:50,688 --> 00:35:53,808
You're not, nathan? Is that how
you get off now, nathan?

609
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:56,373
- No, i don't need to do that.
- You don't?

610
00:35:56,374 --> 00:35:59,223
No. If i need that thing,

611
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:01,560
I need to taste it,
i need to touch it.

612
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:04,023
You know, i need to feel
the skin, the flesh.

613
00:36:04,024 --> 00:36:06,719
I don't need to pretend
to be somebody, sweetheart.

614
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,069
When you're with nathan,
you're with nathan.

615
00:36:16,162 --> 00:36:19,100
May i see my lawyers now, please?

616
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:24,302
Where's your partner?

617
00:36:24,303 --> 00:36:27,525
She said something about going to
take a shower to wash nathan off.

618
00:36:27,526 --> 00:36:31,607
He's got no alibi, but we got no
witness, no weapon, no confession.

619
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:35,792
Rob dow still has a secret. And
now it's time for him to tell us.

620
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:38,587
Yeah? How you gonna do that?

621
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:40,798
Freakshow actually seems
to enjoy lockup.

622
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:43,014
He does seem to enjoy it,
doesn't he?

623
00:36:43,015 --> 00:36:45,084
The question is why?

624
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,913
Look at him, he looks like
he's gonna be rewarded

625
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,731
For keeping that secret.

626
00:36:55,428 --> 00:36:57,865
Rob dow isn't sharing
his secret with us,

627
00:36:57,866 --> 00:37:00,444
But he's waiting
for someone to share it with.

628
00:37:01,725 --> 00:37:04,472
If we want rob dow
to share the secret...

629
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:06,920
Are you thinking
about what i'm thinking about?

630
00:37:06,921 --> 00:37:08,945
About reese in the shower? No.

631
00:37:09,057 --> 00:37:12,185
How come no one out here
treats me like a commanding officer?

632
00:37:12,186 --> 00:37:13,647
We do.

633
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,580
And as my commanding officer,
i'm thinking i need you to let me

634
00:37:16,581 --> 00:37:18,932
Sign someone out of lockup.

635
00:37:22,478 --> 00:37:24,187
This is it, rob.

636
00:37:25,126 --> 00:37:26,807
She's here.

637
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,073
Here in the same room as you.

638
00:37:30,078 --> 00:37:32,551
Breathing the same air as you.

639
00:37:33,155 --> 00:37:34,713
It's real.

640
00:37:35,594 --> 00:37:38,409
Anything you want to say,
now's your chance.

641
00:37:39,962 --> 00:37:42,094
You said you wanted to talk to me?

642
00:37:43,082 --> 00:37:45,159
I don't want you to worry.

643
00:37:46,095 --> 00:37:49,594
- I'm gonna take care of everything, okay?
- Stop talking.

644
00:37:49,595 --> 00:37:51,360
Bethany,

645
00:37:51,361 --> 00:37:54,476
Is there anything that you want to say
to me now?

646
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:57,293
What would i want to say to you?

647
00:37:57,294 --> 00:38:00,439
What you wrote to me
all those times.

648
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,630
I don't know you.

649
00:38:02,631 --> 00:38:04,408
But i saw you.

650
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:06,247
That wasn't me.

651
00:38:06,248 --> 00:38:09,146
I was here tuesday night.

652
00:38:09,147 --> 00:38:12,392
Mike's phone rang. I heard him say
your name, bethany.

653
00:38:12,393 --> 00:38:14,986
He went outside,
and then i saw you.

654
00:38:14,987 --> 00:38:18,083
I stood at the window.
I couldn't even breathe.

655
00:38:18,084 --> 00:38:20,270
I saw you hit him with the racket.

656
00:38:20,285 --> 00:38:22,763
You hit him so hard that it broke.

657
00:38:22,764 --> 00:38:25,995
I tried to clean it all up
out there in the dark.

658
00:38:25,996 --> 00:38:28,384
I will help you with this.

659
00:38:28,646 --> 00:38:33,115
All you have to do is just say
that you love me,

660
00:38:33,755 --> 00:38:36,228
And i will take it all back.

661
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,487
If you saw me,

662
00:38:39,488 --> 00:38:41,470
Would you know me?

663
00:38:41,514 --> 00:38:45,218
I look for you wherever i go.

664
00:38:45,704 --> 00:38:47,066
Bethany,

665
00:38:47,968 --> 00:38:50,373
When we go back to your house,

666
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:53,573
Will we find
a broken tennis racket?

667
00:39:07,528 --> 00:39:10,535
That was in the emails
off rob's computer.

668
00:39:12,342 --> 00:39:14,638
Bethany sent it to rob.

669
00:39:17,982 --> 00:39:19,516
Bethany?

670
00:39:20,326 --> 00:39:22,950
Bethany wasn't born
when this picture was taken.

671
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:46,906
You looked a lot
like your daughter back then.

672
00:39:46,907 --> 00:39:49,026
Probably still do
in the right light.

673
00:39:49,027 --> 00:39:50,962
The party at your club...

674
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:53,745
You and nathan took separate cars.

675
00:39:53,788 --> 00:39:55,601
He was coming from work.

676
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,789
Mrs. Gray, is that
a new tennis racket?

677
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:03,240
There are uniforms
searching your house right now.

678
00:40:03,241 --> 00:40:05,813
They're gonna find
your old racket, aren't they?

679
00:40:06,149 --> 00:40:08,445
The one you hit mike brody with.

680
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:20,376
When we brought bethany
back from school,

681
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:22,344
After all her troubles,

682
00:40:22,678 --> 00:40:25,698
I was the one to close
her computer accounts.

683
00:40:26,886 --> 00:40:28,813
I took one look.

684
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:31,503
I wanted to see
what she'd been doing.

685
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:34,747
I just took one look.

686
00:40:34,748 --> 00:40:38,476
- What did you see?
- I saw a whole world in there.

687
00:40:39,382 --> 00:40:41,842
There's a whole world out here.

688
00:40:42,589 --> 00:40:44,324
Not for me.

689
00:40:45,768 --> 00:40:48,255
See, i used to be bethany.

690
00:40:49,399 --> 00:40:51,886
But i'm not bethany anymore.

691
00:40:52,973 --> 00:40:54,722
But in there...

692
00:40:55,815 --> 00:40:57,837
I was bethany again.

693
00:41:00,148 --> 00:41:02,007
Mike loved me.

694
00:41:02,678 --> 00:41:05,667
Online, on the phone.

695
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:08,542
I went to see him
dressed just like this.

696
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:11,001
I thought that's what he wanted.
