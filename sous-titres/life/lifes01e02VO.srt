{\a6}Office Robert Stark
Former Partner of Charlie Crews

7
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,550
Broke nearly every bone in his body.

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,320
After the case was re-opened,

9
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:24,520
we found that none of the physical
evidence on scene matched officer crews.

{\a6}Los Angeles Four months later

12
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,970
You know,if you had your own car,I
wouldn't have to take you to work.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,100
I don't have a car because
you ran it over with a tractor.

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,530
Not that I was attached to that car.

15
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,800
I was not attached to that car.

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,600
But it doesn't matter anyway.

17
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,050
I'll take the bus. I like the bus.

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,830
Yeah,but somebody has
to take you to the bus.

19
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,340
I'll take him.

20
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,980
But you gotta ride on back.

21
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,500
I'll just go put some clothes on.

22
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,480
Why don't you have any furniture?

23
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,610
You're not attached to her either?

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,950
But you were a little girl once.

25
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,600
There's no proof of that.

26
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,450
Didn't dream of the big wedding?

27
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,570
Dad walking you down the aisle?

28
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,030
Didn't dream about who
your bridesmaids would be?

29
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,530
Didn't dream about the dress either.

30
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,620
Anna turner,married
last night in the hotel.

31
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,870
Housekeeping found her like that.

32
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,100
Someone took the time
to cover her up after.

33
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,570
Cared for her appearance.

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,030
The killer was probably
someone she knew.

35
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,490
Okay,there'll be a lot of out-of-town
guests checked in,family and friends.

36
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,030
No one goes home until we say so.

37
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,760
Cash wedding gifts.

38
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,030
At least,uh...

39
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,610
50 grand in here.

40
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,780
Robbery gone wrong?

41
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,610
Let's get this photographed
and inventoried.

42
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,420
Please,detective,I was hoping
we could just split it up.

43
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,650
And the groom is where?

44
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,410
Hasn't turned up yet.

45
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,850
But would you stick
around if you did that?

46
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,460
Well,doesn't look like he went far.

47
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,980
Why,because he left his shoes here?

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,060
No.

49
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,500
Because he left his
wallet,watch,and keys here.

50
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,920
"Jake silvers."

51
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,610
did you kill your bride,jake?

52
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,860
Okay,listen up.

53
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,310
We're looking for the
groom,jake silvers.

54
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,190
Floor by floor,you all know the drill.

55
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:47,910
Let's go.

56
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,430
How'd you know there was
something in that shoe?

57
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,620
Could see one shoe was heavier than the
other because it sat lower on the carpet.

58
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,420
Oh,you expect me to believe that?

59
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,920
I have no expectations as to
what you will or will not believe.

60
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,360
And whatever you do believe can't
change whatever's in that shoe.

61
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,350
Why exactly can't you
talk like a normal person?

62
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,360
When exactly was the last time
you actually met a normal person?

63
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,930
Anna.

64
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,930
She saved me.

65
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,070
jake?

66
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,430
Hey,maybe you should slow
down a little with the tequila.

67
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,060
I got married last night.

68
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,080
Did you know that?

69
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,360
Yeah,we heard about that.

70
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,210
Is that anna's blood?

71
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,450
You're cops.

72
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,660
How about you stand up for
us right now,jake? Okay?

73
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,580
I'm not a good person.

74
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,820
Why'd you say that?

75
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,770
She thought I was.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,060
I just wanted to be the
person that anna thought I was.

77
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,230
You're gonna put those on me now.

78
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,080
Just for a little while.

79
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,140
This is anna's blood.

80
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,180
I have to go see anna.

81
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,220
We'll take you to her.

82
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,770
No-- no,you won't!

83
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,720
don't shoot!

84
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,040
Don't you shoot.

85
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,110
well,get him outta there.

You were the lead detective on
the charlie crews murder case?

96
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,800
Yeah,I worked that case.

97
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,060
Took my 20 right after we closed it.

98
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,250
And no dna's gonna tell
me we got the wrong guy.

99
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,690
Here's what's left of tom seybolt.

100
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,850
Boyhood friend and part
owner in a bar with crews.

101
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:52,160
But tom was skimming so crews goes
to settle the books and kills tom.

102
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,270
Here's tom's pretty wife.

103
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,430
Dead couple had two kids.

104
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,730
Used to call crews "uncle charlie."

105
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,190
you lost these.

106
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,890

107
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,970

108
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,500

109
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,390
Where's jake?

110
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,300
I hope you die,you son of a bitch!

111
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,680
They should've shot you
for what you did to my anna!

112
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,740
- Parents of the bride?
- Yeah.

113
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,340
don't you just love weddings?

114
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,440
We have hair and blood here.

115
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,940
Blunt force trauma back here.

116
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,780
Somebody pushed her
hard up against the wall.

117
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,480
Somebody strong.

118
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,540
Yeah,or someone very angry.

119
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,280
I just needed to get this bag in-- 
please,I--

120
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,500
hey,that's okay,officer. I got this.

121
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,670
Thanks.

122
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,580
Hey,I'm sorry about that.

123
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,250
I'm detective crews.

124
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,080
You're?

125
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,590
Tiffany...

126
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,790
Tiffie.

127
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,380
I was one of anna's bridesmaids.

128
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,660
You look a lot younger than anna.

129
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,230
Can I ask how you knew her?

130
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,240
Jake and my brother are friends.

131
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,020
But anna was always so nice to me.

132
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,220
She treated me...

133
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,850
So nice.

134
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,350
Um,the disposable cameras.

135
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,920
Anna said it was my job to collect them.

136
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,560
I thought maybe someone would want them.

137
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,800
Of course.

138
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,310
But you didn't have
to bring them up here.

139
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,390
Someone would've come for them.

140
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,560
I wanted...

141
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,990
What is it,tiffie?

142
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,960
She said she had a brother.

143
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,900
Maybe you can call him.

144
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,110
You okay?

145
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,010
She's not used to drinking like this.

146
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,880
I told her have a beer.

147
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,080
Steady her out,you know?

148
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,400
But she wodn't listen to me.

149
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,150
Anna's dead.

150
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,950
I loved her.

151
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,480
I know. I know.  come on.

152
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,290
I got your blood alcohol
level test here,jake.

153
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,080
I don't think I've ever
seen a number this high.

154
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,880
What name will they
put on her tombstone?

155
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,360
Did she take your last name?

156
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,900
Yeah.

157
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,600
She couldn't wait to be anna silvers.

158
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,050
Is that what they'll
put on her tombstone?

159
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,510
Anna silvers?

160
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,970
I'm sure they will.

161
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,180
If she took your
name,that was her name too.

162
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,830
What happened after you
got back to the suite?

163
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,820
I passed out.

164
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,750
And when
you woke up--

165
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,410
go ahead,jake.

166
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,820
What happened when you woke up?

167
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,200
Anna was on the floor.

168
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:04,150
There was...Blood everywhere.

169
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,090
Her dress was in the corner.

170
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,040
She was dead.

171
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,530
So you covered her up?

172
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,520
Yeah.

173
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,990
That's right.

174
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,250
Because you didn't want
her laying there like that.

175
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,820
Why would someone kill her?

176
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,250
You need to know who killed her.

177
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,120
No matter who it is.

178
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:36,980
Is it possible that you did
something and you don't remember it?

179
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,140
- No.
- No?

180
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,080
you had a lot to drink,jake.

181
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,610
I saw you assault my partner.

182
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,110
- You get violent.
- I didn't--

183
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,940
- you get violent when you get drunk.
- No,I didn't!

184
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,800
You've had a problem with violence
in the past,haven't you,jake?

185
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,650
But that was before.

186
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,230
It was before anna.

187
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,970
She saved me.

188
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:00,260
If you loved anna,you need to know who
did it,jake,no matter who that person is.

189
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,030
For her!

190
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,520
I couldn't.

191
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,130
I couldn't.

192
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,060
Could I? I mean...

193
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,400
Could I have?

194
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,650
Detectives,I am jake's attorney.

195
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,380
Jake,I need you to stop talking.

196
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,220
He doesn't have to talk.

197
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,470
We have anna's blood all over him.

198
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,510
We have his assault of a police officer.

199
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,120
That would be me.

200
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,500
I saw you at the hotel,didn't I?

201
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,530
Yeah,that's right.

202
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,420
I was at the wedding,the wedding party.

203
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,230
But in this room,I am jake's attorney.

204
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,940
Well,counselor...

205
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,950
We have his admission of blacking
out during the time of anna's death.

206
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,880
He doesn't have to talk unless he's
interested in avoiding the needle.

207
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,800
Both the tractor and the bentley
are registered to a charlie crews.

208
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,270
Yes,yes,yes--
that is correct.

209
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,950
But you were driving the tractor?

210
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:55,420
Yes,but both vehicles are insured
by your company, so I need you--

211
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,050
I have to get a supervisor.

212
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,330
No,no-- 
I don't need a supervisor.

213
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,900
I need you to¡ª

214
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:20,930
hi.

215
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,230
Hello.

216
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,980
Can I,uh,help you?

217
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,490
Yes,I'm looking for charlie crews.

218
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,940
Oh,well he's not here right now,so...

219
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,120
Oh,what a shame.

220
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,010
You must be that mr. Earley
charlie met in prison.

221
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,370
Is it true you live in his garage?

222
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,720
Well,in a room above
his garage actually,yeah.

223
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,180
You look younger in person.

224
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,570
I've seen you in the papers.

225
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,650
Those pictures they use
aren't very flattering.

226
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,230
No,no...They're...they're not.

227
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,510
They make you look grumpy.

228
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,060
You don't seem grumpy.

229
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,610
Who'd you say you were again?

230
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,950
I didn't,I'm sorry.

231
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,310
I'm olivia.

232
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,700
And are you a friend of charlie's?

233
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,120
Not exactly.

234
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,850
But I hope to be.

235
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,940
I hope to be your friend too,ted.

236
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,340
Husband's got her blood on his hands.

237
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,280
He can't account for where
he was during the murder.

238
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,700
He's got those assault
charges in his jacket.

239
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,820
Let's get what we need to make it stick.

240
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,760
That's an interesting fruit.

241
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,440
Thank you.

242
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,170
It's a horned melon.

243
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:53,750
Also known as a jelly melon,a
kiwano,or the african horned cumber.

244
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,180
African horned cucumber?

245
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:59,500
Yeah,it's an ornamental fruit,but
you can still eat it if you want to.

246
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,160
I thought there'd be more.

247
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,030
More to what?

248
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,470
In the pool...with jake.

249
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,180
You know when you put
those volts in the water?

250
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,520
I was almost dead.

251
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,490
Yeah,I remember that.

252
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,050
It was a near-death experience.

253
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,710
And it not being a full-death
experience should make you happy.

254
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,130
Nothing happened.

255
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,340
There were no lights.

256
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,460
no tunnel.

257
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,360
No dead relatives.

258
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,760
Maybe I wasn't near death enough
for it to be a near-death experience.

259
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,120
Detectives,where are we
with the anna turner killing?

260
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,620
- Jake silvers-- 
- jake didn't do it.

261
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,120
There's no way he killed his wife.

262
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,530
Um,that's very funny you
say jake didn't do it,

263
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,610
because your partner
here says the opposite.

264
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,170
And when I say "that's funny,"
detective,of course I mean that's not funny.

265
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,890
I know,but look--
over the last 12 years,

266
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,390
I've known more than a few
men who've killed their wives.

267
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:01,390
And I looked into jakes' eyes,and
I just didn't see it there.

268
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,850
You looked into his eyes?

269
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,130
They are the windows to the soul.

270
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:10,430
That's very profound,but the lapd
believes jake silvers is a lead suspect,

271
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,740
and because we believe this,

272
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,700
the city of los angeles requires you
to get him for anna turner's murder.

273
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,780
Anna silvers.

274
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,860
What?

275
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,600
She was married.

276
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,350
She took his name.

277
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,810
She died anna silvers.

278
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,750

Hey--

279
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,740
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,870
I sure do not envy you.

281
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,520
Yeah,why is that?

282
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,940
Woman boss,woman partner¡ª

283
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:10,400
makes my head spin st thinking about what
a hen house this department has become.

284
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,450
Not like it used to be,huh?

285
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,550
Hey charlie,you remember my wife?

286
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,620
Leslie?

287
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,520
sure I do.

288
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,320
She's all over me to ask you to
come out the house this weekend.

289
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,980
Having a little backyard
barbeque,family,friends--

290
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,630
say yes,charlie. Don't make
me go back to leslie with a no.

291
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,650
I need to know if this is
gonna be a thing with you.

292
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,160
Which "this" is that?

293
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,710
This thing with jake silvers.

294
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:58,080
Are you gonna go see falsely
accused people everywhere?

295
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,150
You think that's not a good
instinct for a cop to have?

296
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,740
I just need to know if it's
gonna be a thing with you.

297
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:09,430
Shouldn't innocent until proven
guilty be athingwith all of us?

298
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,570
Were jake and anna having problems?

299
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,670
Jake loved anna.

300
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,000
Loved her!

301
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,540
Would never hurt her. ever.

302
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,090
Loved her.

303
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,890
When jake met anna,the
guy was totally lost.

304
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,010
You mean his prior assault charges.

305
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,270
Yeah.

306
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,900
You're pretty.

307
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,380
Shut up,mason! she's a cop.

308
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,580
A pretty,pretty cop.

309
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:48,010
And you,that dude-- 
dude,you are so torn from the headlines!

310
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,950
Thanks,dude.

311
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,200
So you used to date anna.

312
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,380
- A few times.
- once.

313
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,600
You know,just hook ups. nothing serious.

314
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,310
Not like jake.

315
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,200
And what about eddie?

316
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,820
Did eddie ever "hook up" with anna?

317
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,710
That would be a no.

318
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,460
I don't think eddie plays for our team.

319
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,380
Our team? I don't think
eddie plays for any team.

320
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,340
Eddie loves the law.

321
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,880
There he is.

322
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,480
Yo,eddie!

323
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,370
What are you--
what are you doing?

324
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,580
Ease up,eddie.

325
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,160
Why don't you grab yourself something?

326
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,660
Take the edge off.

327
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,930
You're drunk.

328
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,640
Anna is dead,and jake is in jail for it.

329
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:31,880
And the only thing you two can
do is just sit there and drink.

330
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,150
It's a...Wake?

331
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,610
Anna loved jake.

332
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,600
You can't believe how.

333
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,460
Why don'you tell me how?

334
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,840
Anna had a tough time growing up.

335
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,840
Anna used to...Act out.

336
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:53,160
I mean,we all did stuff,but anna
always had to go further-- drink more.

337
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:56,010
Was she involved with drugs?

338
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,760
It's okay. You can tell us.

339
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,250
We're investigating the murder.

340
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,590
Was she involved with drugs?

341
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,750
She always had to do more drugs.

342
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,640
More guys,more everything.

343
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,700
It was more than
partying,what she used to do.

344
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,990
Like,I don't know.

345
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,730
Punishment.

346
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,040
Yeah...Punishment...

347
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,690
Until she met jake.

348
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,610
They were a team.

349
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,990
And you used to date jake.

350
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,720
- On and off.
- at parties sometimes.

351
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,000
Just hook ups?

352
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,430
Can I ask you something?

353
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,600
About anna?

354
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,300
No,about jake.

355
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,450
If he doesn't remember what he did¡ª

356
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,980
what he did to anna,is it as
bad as if he did rember it?

357
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,950
You mean legally?

358
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,590
Tiffany,if jake killed anna,

359
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:55,550
he's going to prison for a very
long time if he remembers it or not.

360
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,440
How's your partner doing?

361
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,830
I'm not a rat,lieutenant.

362
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,900
I'm not asking you to be one,detective.

363
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,980
It'd be better for your partner
if he was removed from duty.

364
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,530
The lapd is not...

365
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,480
The best environment for him to be in.

366
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,140
The best environment?

367
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,610
You can do this,dani.

368
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,870
You can do something good for crews,

369
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,960
for the department,and
good for yourself.

370
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:22,620
So if it's bad for the department,is
it bad for me too,lieutenant?

371
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,040
Where are you right now?

372
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,620
Dani,this is not an excuse to backslide.

373
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,530
Do you understand me?

374
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,800
I'm actually going in
to a meeting right now.

375
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,110
buy me a drink.

376
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,600
Do I know you?

377
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,640
Does it matter?

378
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:31,490
{\a6}detective carl ames(retired)
lead detective crews murder case

379
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:24,380
Mr. Andrews,my realtor called about
me stopping by to look at the house.

380
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,880
There was no forced entry.

381
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,030
They just let crews walk right in.

382
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,160
You mean the killer?

383
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,690
It wasn't crews.

384
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,290
Crews was exonerated.

385
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,720
Sure,if you like.

386
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,450
"The killer."

387
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,100
you have a beautiful home.

388
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,410
Thank you.

389
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,070
Husband's body was
found in the living room.

390
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,100
Throat was slit.

391
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,990
Would you like some tea,mr. Burke?

392
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,540
No,no thank you.

393
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,730
Never thought about selling,

394
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,910
but then your realtor called and
said someone wanted to look,so...

395
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:03,050
As to the wife,the killer
got her on the staircase.

396
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:09,330
As you can see,she was headed back
up to protect her son I would think.

397
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:20,790
And the son-- 
he never made it out of his room.

398
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,500
Or he ran back in there to hide.

399
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,100
Hard to tell.

400
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,480
And the daughter?

401
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,100
Daughter was nine years old.

402
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,360
Well,she was out of the house.

403
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,840
I guess you could call her lucky.

404
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,910
But with this being her family,

405
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:55,930
I'm not sure the word
lucky correctly applies.

406
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,350
Her bed is unmade.

407
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,640
She was here.

408
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,130
If her bed was unmade,then she was here.

409
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,240
Not at a sleepover.

410
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:10,200
They made their beds every day.

411
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,320
They had to make their beds every day.

412
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,540
She was here that night.

413
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,250
Mr. Crews.

414
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,680
It is crews,isn't it?

415
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,260
I'm sorry.

416
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,290
I'll go.

417
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,810
Why come to this place,mr. Crews?

418
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,530
Haven't they punished you
enough for what you didn't do?

419
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:33,070
There were reports you had a
problem with drinking at the end.

420
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,440
You go to hell.

421
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:49,960
lead detective removed
rachel from report

422
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,690
I count four blenders.

423
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,180
Why do people always give
blenders as wedding gifts?

424
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,070
Maybe I'll get my dad a blender.

425
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,290
He's getting married.

426
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,390
Re-married.

427
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,730
Maybe I'll get him a blender.

428
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,510
And I can write on the
card,"congratulations,dad.

429
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,870
I hope you really
enjoy your new blender."

430
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,980
you're doing that thing again where
you're not really talking to me.

431
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,210
I begged her not to marry him.

432
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,470
He was arrested before-- 
you know that.

433
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,510
On assault charges.

434
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,670
Yes,we are aware of that.

435
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,940
I told my anna that jake was trouble.

436
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,150
His whole family's trouble.

437
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:47,130
All of his friends-- 
all they do is drink and make trouble.

438
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:51,520
Jake's lawyer eddie seems
to have turned out okay.

439
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,950
Eddie is anna's friend,detective.

440
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,770
Not jake's.

441
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,880
He hardly knows jake.

442
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,850
I always thought that eddie
and anna might end up together.

443
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,660
Why is that?

444
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,340
Eddie was so in love with her.

445
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,750
He was always at the house.

446
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,170
He was there for her.

447
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,820
He was nice.

448
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,800
Lobby apple.

449
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:16,820
What?

450
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,330
There was a big bowl of
them by the front desk.

451
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,090
The hotel wants you to take 'em.

452
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,830
We can hear you in there.

453
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,320
Uh,I was in the shower.

454
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,910
Your hair's not wet.

455
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,740
I was about to get in.

456
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,680
Why would you say that you were
taking a shower when you weren't?

457
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,690
Hmm,eddie...

458
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,140
You know,you didn't mention that you
were anna's friend and not jake's.

459
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,010
I am under no obligation as an attorney
to mention who my acquaintances are.

460
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,350
But you were anna's friend.

461
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,870
So why would a friend of the
victim represent the accused?

462
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,700
That's very,uh...

463
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,130
what's the word,crews?

464
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,210
Enlightened.

465
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,690
We were friends,okay?

466
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,840
all of us.

467
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,550
Everyone hooking up with everyone.

468
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,890
Yeah,that is right.

469
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,330
Hmm...Bad bed for such a nice hotel.

470
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,760
You oughta complain about it,eddie.

471
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,300
Look,I would like you to leave now.

472
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,300
Everyone hooking up with
everyone else,but not you.

473
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,280
I would like both of you out of my room!

474
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,860
Leave now!

475
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,950
Look...

476
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,720
I tried to throw it away,but I couldn't.

477
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,610
I just couldn't let her go.

478
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,690
Anna porn?

479
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,830
Yeah,I know that looks bad.

480
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,360
No.

481
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,620
It doesn't look bad.

482
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,280
It looks weird,eddie.

483
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,790
Ve,very weird.

484
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,450
This is porn,eddie,onto which you
have pasted the dead woman's face.

485
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,400
This is a product of an illegal search.

486
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,900
This is a centerfold
from ten years ago,eddie.

487
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:11,140
You been going at this a real long time.

488
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,960
There's a word for that kind of thing.

489
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,940
Yeah,how's the jury
gonna take that,eddie?

490
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,700
You must've loved anna a lot.

491
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,780
I did love her.

492
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,470
But I didn't...Kill her.

493
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,250
Jake did.

494
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,120
I loved anna.

495
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,830
A true,true love.

496
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:38,630
And... I have an alibi.

497
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,370
That's him.

498
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,540
You sure?

499
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:53,170
He paid me two grand,made me wear a blonde
wig,a wedding dress,and called me anna.

500
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,870
Yeah,I think I'd remember him.

501
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:04,740
{\a6}constance griffiths
attorney for charlie crews

502
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,430
How long was detective crews in
prison before I took his case?

503
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,180
Nearly eight years.

504
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:05,720
And what was his emotional
state wh you first met him?

505
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,600
You'd have to ask him that.

506
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,290
Hypothetically then.

507
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:13,600
Can you speak about the emotional state of an
innocent man who's been in prison for that long?

508
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,780
Hypothetically?

509
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,310
He gives up.

510
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,960
Gives up on what?

511
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:24,130
He gives up on life.

512
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:30,590
Hey,aren't you that guy?

513
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,330
I might be that guy.

514
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,090
Youarethat guy.

515
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,530
I'm tina.

516
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,600
And I'm gina.

517
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,540
Tina and gina. really?

518
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,800
Really.

519
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:46,130
Hey,they gave you all that money-- 
like,what?

520
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,960
$50 million.

521
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,810
The amount was not disclothed.

522
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,460
Disclosed?

523
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,090
Yeah,that's what she said.

524
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,740
All that money.

525
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,780
Why are you riding the bus?

526
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,820
What kind of a person lives in
l.A. And doesn't have his own car?

527
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,600
A crazy person.

528
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,200
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

529
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,810
Oh no,no,no-- 
it--it'll be fine,olivia.

530
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,400
- Are you sure?
- Oh,100% sure.

531
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,130
Well,95...

532
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:14,160
90-- I'm 90% sure.

533
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,170
Who are they?

534
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,290
This is a bad idea.

535
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,770
Give me a second.

536
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,890
Hey,ted.

537
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
This is tina,and this is gina.

538
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,080
No,I'm tina and this is gina.

539
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,890
- Say "hi," ted.
- Hi.

540
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,040
Tina and gina want to go
swimming,isn't that right?

541
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,320
And I said we have a pool.

542
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,160
No,you said you have a warm pool.

543
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,960
That's right,I did say that,didn't I?

544
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,180
We have a warm pool,don't we,ted?

545
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,260
I don't know. I guess
we keep it about 81-82.

546
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,260
Is that warm?

547
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:52,770
Because I know some people like it around
89 or 90 but that seems hot...To me.

548
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,440
Ted,who's that?

549
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:02,170
Oh,uh,that,uh,that is olivia.

550
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,150
And,uh...She wants to meet you.

551
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,830
I'm very popular.

552
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,120
See,the thing about olivia though is...

553
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,930
That's my cell phone.

554
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,700
Charlie.

555
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,460
Important police business. shh.

556
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,630
Charlie.

557
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:24,890
The thing about olivia,charlie,is
she's marrying your father.

558
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,120
Detective crews.

559
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,520
Crews,davis just called me.

560
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,890
Jake tried to kill himself.

561
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,750
Do you hear me?

562
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,100
Did you hear me?

563
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,120
He's unconscious,but he's not gonna die.

564
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,920
She's marrying your father,and you won't
return their calls so she stopped by.

565
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,060
And she seems really nice,really.

566
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,050
Davis is calling it murder/suicide.

567
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,450
We're charging him when he wakes up.

568
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,300
Come on...say something.

569
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,680
Anything.

570
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,530
I gotta go.

571
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,420
Um...I gotta charge someone with murder.

572
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,070
What?

573
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,750
Lotta paperwork.

574
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:08,470
I'm just gonna get this bus.

575
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,870
Are we,uh...still going swimming?

576
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:41,140
{\a6}officer robert stark
former partner of charlie crews

577
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,930
Does it bother me that my
ex-partner is now a superior?

578
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,420
You know,I hadn't really thought of it
until you went and asked the question.

579
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,180
Is there support on the force
for crews coming back on the job?

580
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:41,950
On the job?

581
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:45,360
That's good,that's like cops talk.

582
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,460
Yeah,there's support.

583
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,890
Hey,he's got a shield. he's one of us.

584
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,680
Ha!

585
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,750
My wife thought you
weren't gonna show up.

586
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,530
I told her,"charlie said he was coming."

587
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:57,720
he's cing.

588
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,870
Hey,bobby.

589
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,260
Whattaya got there?

590
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:02,620
Beer.

591
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,790
nice.

592
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,140
Come on back.

593
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,760
carefully, guys

594
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,850
leslie...

595
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,430
Three kids,huh?

596
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,220
Done real well for yourself.

597
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,000
Oh,yeah,real well.

598
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,800
Why'd you come here,charlie?

599
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,220
I thought you wanted me to come.

600
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,670
Me?

601
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,030
Oh,is that what he said?

602
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,770
Look,I don't know what he
told you to get you here,

603
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:46,040
but I would've hoped you'd
have the decency to stay away.

604
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,150
Did you know that when you went off to
prison they all thought bobby was dirty too?

605
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,720
No one would ride with him.

606
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,810
For four years.

607
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,610
Did you know that?

608
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,340
No.

609
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:05,060
No one would ride with
him for four years.

610
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:11,240
Eat your burger and go back
to your fancy house,okay?

611
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,010
charlie.

612
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,190
You're not going,are you?

613
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,070
Yeah,I,uh...I just gotta get back.

614
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,150
Yeah? okay.

615
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,240
Yeah,no problem.

616
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,010
You know,before you head out...

617
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,950
There's something,uh...

618
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,820
Well,you'll see.

619
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,240
Something I just gotta
show you. come on.

620
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:50,780
Come on,tough guy.

621
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,940
It's not gonna kill you.

622
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:18,490
never know when some teenage knucklehead's
gonna sneak in here,spark up a joint.

623
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,050
Keep meaning to get that fixed.

624
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,420
Ahh. Here it is.

625
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,320
Oh. Here.

626
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,630
Take it--
it's yours.

627
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,680
Oh,yeah,got your old badge here too.

628
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,710
How'd you get these?

629
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,620
Don't ask.

630
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,590
Just kind of fell into my hands.

631
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,410
Thought you might want them.

632
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,410
Well,I don't know what to say.

633
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,820
Say "thanks."

634
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,960
let's get you a burger,huh?

635
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,330
crews.

636
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,120
Crews!

637
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,760
Are you with us?

638
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,750
It's all here.

639
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,860
Except the one thing that isn't here.

640
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,460
Do you know what that means?

641
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,060
Does anybody know what that means?

642
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,670
- going home?
- Yeah.

643
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:25,120
My parents don't want my
sister to miss any more classes.

644
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,210
Hey tiffie,can I see your eyes?

645
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,760
I have a bad headache.

646
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,560
I'd rather just keep
these on if that's okay.

647
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,490
I want to apologize to you,tiffie.

648
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,570
Why would you want to do that?

649
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,520
Because you asked us for our
help,and we didn't listen to you.

650
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,130
I didn't ask for your help.

651
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,040
You asked us to help you help jake.

652
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,770
When you brought us those cameras
you asked,but I wasn't listening.

653
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,190
What is he talking about?

654
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,510
No,I can't help anybody.

655
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,990
Think how you would feel if jake went
to prison for a crime he didn't commit.

656
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,560
Anna loved jake.

657
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:04,310
Don't you think she'd
want you to save jake?

658
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:09,500
How... How can I save jake?

659
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,400
You're the only one who can.

660
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,630
You have the answer.

661
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,500
And you've had it all along,haven't you?

662
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:19,330
Tiffany,detective crews is
gonna show you some photos.

663
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,800
We want you to look at
them very closely. Okay?

664
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:28,510
Maybe you can tell my sister
what she should be looking for.

665
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,130
You see it,don't you,tiffie?

666
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,980
What is she supposed to see?

667
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:39,620
They're just stupid wedding pictures.

668
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,410
- Let me see those.
- no-- you're fine.

669
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:46,030
See in the background there?

670
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:52,890
And there by the d.J. And
in this one by the wall.

671
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,850
What are you doing in
these pictures,tiffany?

672
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,630
I'm taking pictures.

673
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:02,260
In these pictures,I
see you taking pictures.

674
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,300
But I went through all the pictures,

675
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:07,210
and I couldn't find any of
the pictures I see you taking.

676
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,280
Where are those pictures,tiffany?

677
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,330
What is that,some kind of riddle?

678
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,140
What kind of cop are you?

679
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:18,170
You brought us the cameras,but did
you bring us all of the cameras?

680
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,800
Did you hold on to one?

681
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,490
Did you hold on to your camera?

682
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,200
Because you took a picture of something?

683
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,870
Something you shouldn't have?

684
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,140
Where is the camera,tiffany?

685
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,930
He smashed it.

686
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,600
Let me see your eyes,tiffie.

687
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,870
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

688
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,710
Uh,this should not take long.

689
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,410
Are we going to find out who did it?

690
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,750
Okay.

691
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,940
I was drinking.

692
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,620
I shouldn't have been.

693
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,420
But I felt so grown up.

694
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,830
Where were you?

695
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,690
Anna's room.

696
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,770
It was me,jake,and anna.

697
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:28,360
I was drinking and then I didn't feel
so well,so I went to the bathroom.

698
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:31,000
I woke up on the bathroom floor...

699
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,600
And I heard voices.

700
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,300
Two voices.

701
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,840
Anna...

702
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,810
And my brother,bradley.

703
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,830
You better shut your mouth!

704
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,150
That's one,bradley.

705
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,260
One what?

706
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,230
You heard voices...

707
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:50,360
They were in the living room arguing-- 
anna and bradley.

708
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,790
Bradley was drunk.

709
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,780
Real drunk like he gets.

710
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,430
Mean like he gets.

711
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,330
Don't say one more word!

712
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:01,380
That's two,bradley. You don't
want it to get to three,understand?

713
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,430
It was crazy.

714
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,630
anna was naked.

715
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:06,550
She must've gotten
woken up or something.

716
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,370
Bradley was trying to steal that money.

717
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:10,460
That stupid purse full of money!

718
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,700
And she caught him.

719
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,940
He was so drunk.

720
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,880
And then what happened?

721
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,010
Anna told him he was nothing.

722
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:21,330
Her voice was so soft that I
thought everything was gonna be okay.

723
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,440
But it wasn't okay.

724
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,440
It happened so fast.

725
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,450
Bradley grabbed her by the neck.

726
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,740
He pushed her against the wall so hard.

727
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,560
I didn't know what to do.

728
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:38,800
I looked down,and I had
the camera in my hand.

729
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,980
I took the picture...

730
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,050
Of him standing over her.

731
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,600
I saw it.

732
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,030
That was three,bradley.

733
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:57,510
Didn't I tell you you
didn't want to get to three?

734
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,740
He smashed the camera.

735
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,660
He said I didn't see anything,but I did.

736
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,890
I saw what he did to anna.

737
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,680
Anna would be happy I saved jake.

738
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,940
chapter seven on vengeance.

739
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:52,550
Revenge is a poison meant for others
that we end up swallowing ourselves

740
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:56,490
vengeance is a dark light
that blinds all who seek it.

741
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,800
The untroubled soul knows
there is no justice in revenge.

742
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:06,360
The untroubled soul knows that to
seek vengeance is to seek destruction.
