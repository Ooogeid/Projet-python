1
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:06,759
You ever have a nickname?

2
00:00:06,828 --> 00:00:08,661
No, i never did. Would you like one?

3
00:00:08,729 --> 00:00:10,030
No.

4
00:00:10,097 --> 00:00:11,431
Come on, i'm real good at 'em.

5
00:00:11,498 --> 00:00:12,532
You want me to give you one?

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,901
Crews... that's my name.

7
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:17,170
It'd be confusing if
your name was my name.

8
00:00:17,238 --> 00:00:21,975
Okay, reese. Dani reese.

9
00:00:23,777 --> 00:00:25,712
Dani reese.

10
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:29,249
Your initials are d.r. That's good.

11
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:31,818
D.r. Is good.

12
00:00:31,886 --> 00:00:33,419
D.r. Stands for doctor.

13
00:00:33,487 --> 00:00:35,155
And there you have
it. Couldn't be better.

14
00:00:35,223 --> 00:00:38,524
D.r. Is doctor. Doctor is "doc."

15
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:41,027
Doc reese. Instant classic.

16
00:00:41,095 --> 00:00:45,031
Doc is a great name.
I wish i had that name.

17
00:00:45,099 --> 00:00:47,000
Doc!

18
00:00:47,068 --> 00:00:51,671
Might be confusing if we
both had the same nicknames.

19
00:01:12,593 --> 00:01:14,527
No gunshot.

20
00:01:14,595 --> 00:01:16,429
No signs of trauma.

21
00:01:16,497 --> 00:01:18,231
Can you help me roll him over?

22
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,475
Stab wounds. No blood.

23
00:01:29,543 --> 00:01:33,313
Gone about 12 hours on the outside.

24
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:36,149
You think he od'd?

25
00:01:36,217 --> 00:01:37,450
He sure dressed for it.

26
00:01:37,518 --> 00:01:40,753
He was in that band that
played here last night.

27
00:01:40,821 --> 00:01:42,622
Rock and roll, huh?

28
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:44,557
No track marks.

29
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:45,926
He looks healthy.

30
00:01:45,993 --> 00:01:47,928
Healthy except for being dead.

31
00:01:47,995 --> 00:01:51,031
Well, i guess not that healthy.

32
00:01:51,098 --> 00:01:53,099
You think maybe he just died?

33
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:54,467
People do do that, don't they?

34
00:01:54,535 --> 00:01:56,403
People do just die.

35
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,604
We should run a tox screen.

36
00:01:58,672 --> 00:02:00,840
Yeah, we should run one.

37
00:02:00,908 --> 00:02:02,642
But... but?

38
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:05,979
His makeup's smeared.

39
00:02:06,047 --> 00:02:07,480
Well, he probably had a long night.

40
00:02:07,548 --> 00:02:11,418
No, look closer.

41
00:02:11,485 --> 00:02:13,686
Well, it's smeared in
one direction like...

42
00:02:13,754 --> 00:02:15,255
like he pressed against something.

43
00:02:15,323 --> 00:02:18,458
Or something pressed against him.

44
00:02:57,831 --> 00:02:59,399
Plastic wrap.

45
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:01,034
Well, what's that it's got on it?

46
00:03:01,102 --> 00:03:02,602
I don't know.

47
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:03,803
It looks like...

48
00:03:03,871 --> 00:03:05,205
makeup?

49
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:12,479
Here, take the corners.

50
00:03:12,546 --> 00:03:15,882
Carefully.

51
00:03:26,627 --> 00:03:29,062
Wow, it's like a death mask.

52
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:36,569
Someone held this over his face

53
00:03:36,637 --> 00:03:39,939
and suffocated him.

54
00:03:40,007 --> 00:03:43,076
Well, maybe he didn't just die.

55
00:03:56,335 --> 00:03:58,937
Crews. Hot lead?

56
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,638
They're a cover band.

57
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,141
Remember a group called heavy caliber?

58
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,276
No. From the '80s?

59
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:06,277
No.

60
00:04:06,345 --> 00:04:08,046
Looked a lot like this?

61
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,381
I really wasn't into guys with wigs.

62
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:13,585
Well, hot lead was a
heavy caliber cover band.

63
00:04:13,652 --> 00:04:16,554
Lead singer, mitch wagner.

64
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:17,889
I talked to the guy at the door.

65
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,091
They sold this place out.

66
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,093
Last four nights too.

67
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,095
Singing someone else's music.

68
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:25,864
All those people came to watch him

69
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,833
pretending to be someone else.

70
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:35,440
Killer comes up behind him,
pulls this over his face.

71
00:04:35,507 --> 00:04:40,345
You think this is the last thing he saw?

72
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:42,981
No.

73
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,283
His breath would have
fogged up the plastic.

74
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:51,089
He wouldn't have seen
anything at the end.

75
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,524
The show ended, the band left,

76
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:54,860
the place was locked up.

77
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,427
Cleaning crew comes in this morning

78
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:58,429
and finds the lead
singer up on the stage.

79
00:04:58,497 --> 00:05:00,365
The victim's wife was in san diego.

80
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:01,532
She's on her way back now.

81
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,268
The piece of plastic
he was suffocated with?

82
00:05:03,335 --> 00:05:06,471
No fingerprints on it. Waiting for dna.

83
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:08,073
The band left together.

84
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,875
We're on our way now to
go talk to the other three.

85
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,043
Heavy caliber cover band.

86
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,079
I saw heavy caliber
play the garden once.

87
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,614
The lead singer was a "jude" something.

88
00:05:16,682 --> 00:05:18,449
Jude hays?

89
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:19,684
Yeah, jude hays.

90
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,386
Died in london. Drank
himself to death, right?

91
00:05:21,453 --> 00:05:22,954
I really don't remember.

92
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,290
Doc wasn't into guys with wigs.

93
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:26,691
Doc?

94
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,462
Dani reese. D.r.

95
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,165
D.r. Is... doctor.

96
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:38,736
Doc. Doc reese.

97
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,072
What's the matter with her?

98
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,540
I don't know.

99
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,742
Doc's a great name. I
wish i had that name.

100
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:45,811
It would be confusing.

101
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,213
You're probably right.

102
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,384
You all left together last night?

103
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:54,419
After the show.

104
00:05:54,486 --> 00:05:55,921
And then?

105
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:57,856
Hal and i went to a party.

106
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,590
And after the party?

107
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:01,392
Eric and i went to an after party.

108
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,595
And after the after party?

109
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:06,965
Was there an after after
party after the after party?

110
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:12,437
No, after the after party,
we went home...t ogether.

111
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:15,106
Good show last night.

112
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,541
Standing room only.

113
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:18,043
You have a lot of fans.

114
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,445
Mitch had a lot of fans.

115
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:21,746
When he was dressed like jude hays.

116
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:22,914
It wasn't just the costume.

117
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,682
I mean, when mitch picked up that mike

118
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,884
and stepped up in front of the crowd...

119
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,418
he was jude hays?

120
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:29,587
Sometimes it felt that way.

121
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,456
It feel that way last night?

122
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:34,092
When you left last night,

123
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,161
had mitch taken off his costume?

124
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,795
We don't go around
dressed like heavy caliber.

125
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,064
We'd all changed.

126
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:41,566
Why? How was he dressed
when you found him?

127
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,011
He shouldn't be much longer.

128
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:20,372
Dr. Stanton.

129
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,640
There's a detective here to see you.

130
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:26,311
Oh, why don't you come on back.

131
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,150
Go ahead and open wide for me.

132
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,285
Open wide?

133
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:36,487
Your mouth.

134
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:40,025
Let me have a quick look,
then i'll take your history,

135
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,459
then i'll get you into the chair.

136
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,895
Dr. Stanton, i'm a detective.

137
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,163
Yes.

138
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,233
And there will be the
standard police discount.

139
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,701
I'm a homicide detective.

140
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:52,570
Homicide?

141
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:56,374
So this is not about your dental needs.

142
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,375
Anyone you can think of
that would have wanted

143
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:58,810
to harm mitch?

144
00:07:58,877 --> 00:08:01,712
Tyler sims. Our first singer.

145
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,749
Your first...

146
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,418
so tyler sims was jude hays

147
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:08,486
before mitch was jude hays?

148
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,555
What happened to tyler?

149
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:11,856
Had to ask him to leave.

150
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,391
Because of what happened in fresno.

151
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:16,194
What happened in
fresno? It was terrible.

152
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,662
The fans went psycho.

153
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:20,231
They threw things. They came onstage.

154
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,499
They went after tyler.

155
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,667
Well, they went after all of us.

156
00:08:22,734 --> 00:08:24,269
What made them so angry?

157
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,004
Tyler.

158
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,605
He sang his own song.

159
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,174
He sang his own song?

160
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:30,875
He sang his own song.

161
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,944
Not a heavy caliber cover song?

162
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,947
No, one he wrote himself.

163
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:40,018
And so the fans felt betrayed.

164
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,686
Because he wasn't jude hays anymore.

165
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:44,856
And so you asked him to leave.

166
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:46,057
We're hot lead!

167
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,859
<i>We're the heavy caliber cover band.</i>

168
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:50,061
That's who we are.
That's what they want.

169
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,163
How did tyler take it

170
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,798
when you asked him to leave the band?

171
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,634
Mm, not good.

172
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,668
And when you hired the new singer?

173
00:08:57,736 --> 00:08:58,870
It just got worse.

174
00:08:58,937 --> 00:09:00,938
Tyler showed up at a
gig dressed as jude.

175
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,574
Came at mitch, broke two of his ribs.

176
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:05,443
When did you last see tyler?

177
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,446
Night he attacked mitch.

178
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,948
He did time for it. Four months.

179
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,550
Have you seen tyler
since he got out of jail?

180
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:18,223
Doc, can i ask you about
these marks on your wall?

181
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,959
The original bassist for heavy caliber,

182
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,895
before the band broke up

183
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:27,232
he bedded 4,378.

184
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:29,167
Bedded?

185
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,036
So you are...

186
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,738
just being true to the music.

187
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,176
Where were you after the show?

188
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,645
With a new friend.

189
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:42,680
We'll be needing her name.

190
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,516
Of course.

191
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:49,054
Detective, i have some
time before my next patient.

192
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,523
Shall i uncap the sharpie?

193
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,724
No.

194
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:58,930
Do not uncap the sharpie.

195
00:09:58,997 --> 00:10:00,065
Okay, i'll wait for it.

196
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,566
"Uncap the sharpie?"

197
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:02,600
By that he meant...

198
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:03,801
his sharpie, crews.

199
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,503
He was planning on uncapping it.

200
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,639
Right there in the office?

201
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:11,309
Okay, got it. Thanks.

202
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:14,112
Okay.

203
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,047
Hot lead's first singer, tyler sims,

204
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,382
did four months out in county

205
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,616
for that assault on mitch wagner.

206
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:19,717
Got out six months ago.

207
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:20,918
And since then?

208
00:10:20,986 --> 00:10:22,120
There's no record on him.

209
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:26,157
No dmv, no dwp, no land
lines, no cell phones.

210
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,793
So tyler sims gets
thrown out of the band

211
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,596
for not being jude hays enough.

212
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:33,598
Then ne goes missing.

213
00:10:33,665 --> 00:10:35,533
Maybe if he couldn't be jude hays

214
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,502
he didn't want to be at all.

215
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,137
Grown men in wigs and make-up...

216
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,906
pretending to be other grown
men in wigs and make-up.

217
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,808
The buddha said we live our lives

218
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,510
pretending to be someone else.

219
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,312
Oh, he said that, did he?

220
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:49,013
Who did the buddha pretend to be.

221
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,716
He was the buddha.

222
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:53,585
Okay, i know you're pretty sure

223
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:55,153
you're not pretending
to be someone else.

224
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,656
But maybe, reese, maybe you're
pretending to be yourself.

225
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,159
How could i pretend to be myself?

226
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,328
Maybe the buddha was
pretending to be the buddha.

227
00:11:03,395 --> 00:11:04,829
That makes sense.

228
00:11:04,896 --> 00:11:07,365
And maybe tyler sims was
pretending to be a killer

229
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,501
and pulled that plastic wrap
around mitch wagner's face.

230
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,102
But we can't find tyler sims,

231
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:16,841
so let's look for jude hays.

232
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:18,343
Celebrity impersonators.

233
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,013
Birthday parties, singing telegrams.

234
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,948
If you can't be in the cover band

235
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,051
but you need to be
jude hays, you do this.

236
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,086
These ads list jude hays

237
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,022
as one of the impersonations they do.

238
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:32,690
And they come right to your door.

239
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,756
Do we know that one?

240
00:12:05,824 --> 00:12:07,458
Yeah, i think we do.

241
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:08,593
Hey, we know you. Don't we?

242
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,995
No, you don't know me.

243
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,497
Is that tyler sims?

244
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,332
No, it's not. It's someone else.

245
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,600
I'm gonna go.

246
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,302
I don't know what you're into here,

247
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,937
but, uh, i don't do it.

248
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,939
Hey.

249
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,641
That's who you are.

250
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,743
Yeah, you're that girl.

251
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,078
What girl?

252
00:12:27,145 --> 00:12:29,280
Tell 'em what girl.

253
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,449
Last year when we were auditioning

254
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,918
for a new lead singer, she showed up.

255
00:12:33,985 --> 00:12:35,353
Well we know she didn't get the job.

256
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,588
Did she get to audition?

257
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,989
She's a girl. And we're hot lead.

258
00:12:39,057 --> 00:12:41,226
So what? I can't be jude hays?

259
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:45,029
No.

260
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,997
You know what happened
at the mayan last night?

261
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:49,100
Someone killed mitch wagner.

262
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:50,268
You know anything about it?

263
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,337
I know you called my service

264
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:53,738
asking for a singing telegram.

265
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:55,940
I know that was a lie.

266
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:58,543
And i know i'm out of here.

267
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:02,847
It's always a pleasure
every time i see you two.

268
00:13:06,885 --> 00:13:09,019
What happened last time you saw her?

269
00:13:09,087 --> 00:13:12,823
At the audition we laughed at her...

270
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:15,360
when we saw who she was.

271
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:16,694
How come you didn't
mention her when we asked

272
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,696
if there was anyone who
would want to harm mitch?

273
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,698
I guess we forgot all about her.

274
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,834
Well we know how to find her.

275
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,446
Ma'am, can we help you?

276
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,650
Are you detectives crews and reese?

277
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,251
Yes, we are.

278
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,952
You're emma wagner.

279
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,455
We're very sorry for your loss, ma'am.

280
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:50,194
You didn't have to come to
us. We'd have come to you.

281
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:52,397
I was too afraid to stay home.

282
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,732
Why were you afraid?

283
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,534
Do you know who tyler sims is?

284
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,202
Mitch replaced him in hot lead

285
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,570
and then tyler assaulted mitch.

286
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,339
Has tyler done something else?

287
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,841
He called me. When?

288
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:07,412
About an hour ago. What did he say?

289
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,614
He said he understood.

290
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,383
He said mitch was jude hays
and he was jude hays too.

291
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:16,053
So if i wanted,

292
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:17,789
he'd come over and sing.

293
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,724
Emma, what phone did he call on?

294
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,225
My home phone.

295
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,695
Do you mind if we run a
trace on that number, emma?

296
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:27,465
No.

297
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,634
No one named tyler sims works here.

298
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,569
We traced a call from here this morning.

299
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:32,903
You want to double check?

300
00:14:32,971 --> 00:14:36,641
I know all my employees, ma'am.

301
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,478
He works here. But his
name isn't tyler sims.

302
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,813
It's... jude hays?

303
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,147
Yeah.

304
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,550
I thought he was goofing
on me when we hired him.

305
00:14:45,617 --> 00:14:48,285
Shows me his driver's
license. Jude hays.

306
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:51,489
Like the singer, died in
the auto wreck in mexico.

307
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,558
Six billion people on the planet.

308
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:55,159
There's got to be more
than one jude hays.

309
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,261
Is your jude hays here today?

310
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:11,743
Jude hays, we're looking for tyler sims.

311
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,810
You seen him around?

312
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,301
you called mitch wagner's
house, talk to his wife?

313
00:15:29,369 --> 00:15:30,970
There a law against that?

314
00:15:31,038 --> 00:15:32,571
Not against that there isn't.

315
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,841
I just wanted her to know. Know what?

316
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:38,344
Her husband had jude's
voice. I got it too.

317
00:15:38,411 --> 00:15:41,981
If she was missing it,
i might sing to her.

318
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:46,953
Where were you last night, tyler?

319
00:15:47,021 --> 00:15:49,055
<i>Where were you last night, jude?</i>

320
00:15:49,123 --> 00:15:50,790
Home asleep.

321
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:52,759
I work real hard and when
i get home, i just conk out.

322
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,393
You didn't happen to kill mitch wagner

323
00:15:54,461 --> 00:15:55,494
before you conked out?

324
00:15:55,562 --> 00:15:57,864
Yes, i did. God, you're good.

325
00:15:57,931 --> 00:15:59,666
He did take your dream job away.

326
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:02,635
If you were jude and mitch was jude,

327
00:16:02,703 --> 00:16:04,170
well you couldn't both be jude.

328
00:16:04,237 --> 00:16:05,404
So maybe one of you had to go.

329
00:16:05,472 --> 00:16:07,006
We could both be jude.

330
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:08,274
Plenty of jude to go around.

331
00:16:08,341 --> 00:16:09,676
Yeah, but you changed your name.

332
00:16:09,743 --> 00:16:11,577
So you were a little
more jude than mitch was.

333
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:13,079
Did it legal. Went to the courthouse.

334
00:16:13,147 --> 00:16:14,280
It was kind of like getting married.

335
00:16:14,347 --> 00:16:16,448
You want to tell us
what happened in fresno?

336
00:16:16,516 --> 00:16:19,385
Not particularly. Crowd got ugly.

337
00:16:19,452 --> 00:16:20,519
They were small-minded.

338
00:16:20,587 --> 00:16:22,021
They came to hear jude hays.

339
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:23,189
You gave 'em one of your songs.

340
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:25,424
No, i gave them a jude hays song.

341
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:27,226
But you wrote that song, not hays.

342
00:16:27,294 --> 00:16:29,729
That was the song jude
hays would've written

343
00:16:29,797 --> 00:16:30,863
if he had lived.

344
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:33,032
I gave that crowd a new jude hays song.

345
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,534
But they were small-minded.

346
00:16:35,602 --> 00:16:36,836
I get paid by the hour.

347
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:41,273
So if you're done, i
gotta get back to work.

348
00:16:41,341 --> 00:16:42,709
Okay, thanks.

349
00:16:42,776 --> 00:16:45,078
The telegram girl's name is patty york.

350
00:16:45,145 --> 00:16:46,813
And that's not her only job.

351
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,715
She works at the box
office at the mayan theater.

352
00:16:48,782 --> 00:16:50,817
She has a master key
that opens all the doors.

353
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:51,951
Asian pear.

354
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,586
Looks like an apple, but it's not.

355
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:57,289
Also known as a sand
pear, apple pear, papple.

356
00:16:57,357 --> 00:16:58,891
"Papple?"

357
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,764
Or bapple.

358
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:07,100
Patty york?

359
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:08,267
You remember us?

360
00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:10,069
Sure.

361
00:17:10,137 --> 00:17:12,671
You're those cops that called me

362
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,975
to that house to sing.

363
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:21,413
You always wanted to be jude hays?

364
00:17:21,481 --> 00:17:23,716
Yes. My mom was sort of a groupie.

365
00:17:23,784 --> 00:17:28,187
Do you want some, uh,
soda or a cigarette?

366
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,422
I think i have some cigarettes here.

367
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,092
No, thank you. We're okay.

368
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,028
You didn't tell us you worked
here at the mayan, patty.

369
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,064
I'm sorry. Was i supposed to?

370
00:17:38,132 --> 00:17:40,633
That was stupid. I
should've told you that.

371
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,202
Of course you'd want to know that.

372
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,204
You mind if we ask you
about when you auditioned

373
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,974
<i>for hot lead last year?</i>

374
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,976
Those two tell you what happened?

375
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:52,879
They did. What did they say?

376
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,914
They said they laughed at you.

377
00:17:54,982 --> 00:17:56,816
I guess they did.

378
00:17:56,884 --> 00:17:59,152
You worked her at the mayan,
yet they never saw you here?

379
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:01,120
Bands go in and out the back.

380
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:04,991
You don't want a soda or some cheese?

381
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:08,194
I think i brought some cheese.

382
00:18:08,262 --> 00:18:10,797
You have a key to the back door, right?

383
00:18:10,864 --> 00:18:14,733
You're here because you
think i killed that guy

384
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,170
because they wouldn't
let me in their band?

385
00:18:17,237 --> 00:18:19,872
That and because you work
right where the murder happened.

386
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,676
I work here because it's
where heavy caliber played

387
00:18:23,743 --> 00:18:25,044
whenever they were in la.

388
00:18:25,112 --> 00:18:28,981
<i>I got a bootleg, live at the mayan.</i>

389
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:32,051
You can hear my mom in the background

390
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:35,188
hollering, "turn it up!"

391
00:18:35,255 --> 00:18:39,125
Patty, you use a lot of plastic.

392
00:18:39,193 --> 00:18:40,860
Germs. You gotta be careful.

393
00:18:40,928 --> 00:18:42,561
Well, there's nothing
in that plastic there.

394
00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:43,629
What's that for?

395
00:18:43,697 --> 00:18:45,531
There's plastic in that plastic.

396
00:18:45,598 --> 00:18:48,434
For leftovers? Gotta be careful.

397
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:52,205
We're gonna take some of
this plastic with us, okay?

398
00:18:52,272 --> 00:18:53,840
Where were you last night, patty?

399
00:18:53,907 --> 00:18:57,844
Home with winston, my rabbit.

400
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,218
The cheese is his.

401
00:19:16,496 --> 00:19:19,431
What does it mean to take a life?

402
00:19:19,499 --> 00:19:22,034
It means that life is now yours.

403
00:19:22,102 --> 00:19:26,572
All that it was, all
that it could've been.

404
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:29,842
If you do not want it,
then you should not take it.

405
00:19:41,255 --> 00:19:45,324
Charles. Dad.

406
00:19:47,694 --> 00:19:50,629
How's your bullet wound?

407
00:19:50,697 --> 00:19:53,165
Oh, you know, healing up.

408
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,435
How's yours? Healing up.

409
00:19:56,503 --> 00:20:02,241
Charlie. Ted, this is my, uh, father.

410
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:08,180
Ted? Ted.

411
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:11,083
What are you doing here, dad?

412
00:20:11,151 --> 00:20:14,353
I'm looking for olivia.
Why are you looking here?

413
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,654
I thought she might come to see you.

414
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:17,123
To see me?

415
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:22,361
Why would she come to see you?

416
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,562
She left me.

417
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,732
Olivia called off the
wedding and walked out.

418
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,003
Oh, that's... that's terrible.

419
00:20:31,071 --> 00:20:32,838
Yeah.

420
00:20:32,906 --> 00:20:34,706
Why'd she walk out on you, dad?

421
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:38,844
Because of you. Because of me?

422
00:20:38,912 --> 00:20:40,813
What the hell are you talking about?

423
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,214
She left me because of you.

424
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,550
Because of me? Because of you?

425
00:20:44,617 --> 00:20:45,952
Does he really have to be here?

426
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:47,219
Ted, could you... would you mind?

427
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:51,257
Oh. You know.

428
00:20:51,325 --> 00:20:52,358
You two live together?

429
00:20:52,426 --> 00:20:54,493
Why'd she walk out on you, dad?

430
00:20:54,561 --> 00:20:57,363
Because of whatever it is
that you and i are doing,

431
00:20:57,431 --> 00:20:59,665
she says she can't take it anymore.

432
00:20:59,732 --> 00:21:03,702
And until we resolve
things, the wedding is off.

433
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,905
Your last name. Earley? Earley. Yeah.

434
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,240
I know that name. Ted earley.

435
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,443
You a friend of olivia's?

436
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,512
So many different kinds of friend.

437
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,646
Which kind are you?

438
00:21:14,714 --> 00:21:16,048
This is not the way to resolve things.

439
00:21:16,116 --> 00:21:17,283
Okay, you want to resolve things?

440
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:19,251
You never said sorry for shooting me.

441
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,620
No. Never did.

442
00:21:21,688 --> 00:21:23,589
You're a real tough guy, aren't you?

443
00:21:23,656 --> 00:21:25,191
Apple in the tree. You know?

444
00:21:25,258 --> 00:21:29,095
What does he mean by
he's a friend of olivia's?

445
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,097
I mean... ted.

446
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:35,134
I love her. Oh, here we go.

447
00:21:35,202 --> 00:21:38,237
You what? What kind of a house is this?

448
00:21:38,305 --> 00:21:40,206
You gonna shoot me too? Hello.

449
00:21:40,273 --> 00:21:41,207
Oh! What?

450
00:21:41,274 --> 00:21:43,209
Your credit card got billed

451
00:21:43,276 --> 00:21:45,711
for last time i was here so it turns out

452
00:21:45,778 --> 00:21:48,047
i do owe you a song.

453
00:21:48,115 --> 00:21:51,150
Probably not the best time.

454
00:21:55,222 --> 00:21:56,588
Maybe one of you can give me a ride

455
00:21:56,656 --> 00:21:57,856
back to the bus stop.

456
00:21:57,924 --> 00:21:59,325
It's a hike.

457
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:13,839
That guy was your dad? Yes.

458
00:22:13,907 --> 00:22:17,976
And who shot him? I shot him.

459
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,247
Why is your car full of bullet holes?

460
00:22:21,314 --> 00:22:22,415
I shot it.

461
00:22:22,482 --> 00:22:24,116
You sure shoot a lot of things.

462
00:22:24,184 --> 00:22:26,519
<i>Maybe you should be in hot lead.</i>

463
00:22:28,888 --> 00:22:31,390
You really come tonight to sing?

464
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:33,159
Look, i know i'm a suspect.

465
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:36,095
That a rabbit isn't an alibi.

466
00:22:36,163 --> 00:22:39,831
But i want to help find mitch's killer.

467
00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:42,000
Because he was jude hays
and you're jude hays too?

468
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:47,339
No. Because he was a human being.

469
00:22:49,709 --> 00:22:52,178
The plastic we took from
you doesn't match the plastic

470
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,612
that killed mitch.

471
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,648
So does that mean i'm not a suspect?

472
00:22:56,716 --> 00:23:00,619
No. It means the plastics don't match.

473
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,091
You wanna find out what goes on

474
00:23:05,158 --> 00:23:08,360
around the theater at night,

475
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,529
you should talk to al.

476
00:23:26,913 --> 00:23:28,547
Hey, al.

477
00:23:39,192 --> 00:23:40,426
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

478
00:23:40,494 --> 00:23:43,795
Okay. Okay. Okay.

479
00:23:43,863 --> 00:23:48,734
Okay. Got me.

480
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:50,369
What are you doing?

481
00:23:50,437 --> 00:23:53,905
I'm not stealing.

482
00:23:53,973 --> 00:23:55,407
Oh, yeah? It sure looked like you were.

483
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,209
Well, it's... it's just stuff

484
00:23:57,277 --> 00:24:00,546
that people left out there in public.

485
00:24:00,614 --> 00:24:01,880
It's... it's... it's valuable stuff.

486
00:24:01,948 --> 00:24:04,082
But they... they left it,

487
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,085
so it's... it's not stealin'.

488
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:10,055
He's got a point. You get anything good?

489
00:24:10,123 --> 00:24:12,891
Sure did. Got a gold lighter.

490
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:16,028
$23. And banana bread.

491
00:24:16,095 --> 00:24:19,365
With chocolate chips?
Hadn't tasted it yet.

492
00:24:19,432 --> 00:24:20,699
Patty told us if we want to know

493
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:23,035
what goes on around here,
we should talk to you.

494
00:24:23,102 --> 00:24:27,573
Well, i, you know, see a few things

495
00:24:27,641 --> 00:24:30,276
every now and again.

496
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,812
You ever see this guy? No.

497
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,314
You're asking me 'cause
that hair band guy

498
00:24:35,382 --> 00:24:37,115
got himself killed, huh?

499
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:40,052
And so you know,

500
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:44,756
i didn't see patty that night either.

501
00:24:44,824 --> 00:24:47,926
You see somebody down here, al?

502
00:24:47,994 --> 00:24:49,861
You were taking food
from a dead guy's shine

503
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:53,566
so maybe you can help catch his killer.

504
00:24:57,404 --> 00:25:02,007
I saw him go in the back door.

505
00:25:02,075 --> 00:25:04,943
The victim. Was he alone?

506
00:25:05,011 --> 00:25:09,515
No. I saw him go in too.

507
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:10,849
You sure you saw him?

508
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:14,786
He had real white teeth.

509
00:25:14,854 --> 00:25:18,457
So i remembered.

510
00:25:18,525 --> 00:25:21,594
And he came out by himself.

511
00:25:21,661 --> 00:25:23,862
Can i go get my banana bread now?

512
00:25:28,335 --> 00:25:30,236
The dentist didn't
mention that he came back

513
00:25:30,303 --> 00:25:32,605
with mitch wagner the
night he was killed.

514
00:26:09,376 --> 00:26:11,076
You must be dr. Sharpie.

515
00:26:22,235 --> 00:26:24,203
Auditions for a new cover band?

516
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,372
Your buddy isn't even in the
ground and you're moving on.

517
00:26:26,439 --> 00:26:28,940
Where's your candle in the wind, pal?

518
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:31,477
Auditioning new singers
isn't really breaking the law.

519
00:26:31,544 --> 00:26:32,878
We got a witness that
puts him in the theater

520
00:26:32,945 --> 00:26:34,046
at the time of the killing.

521
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:35,447
Whoever said that's a liar.

522
00:26:35,515 --> 00:26:37,316
I mean, we're all liars.

523
00:26:37,384 --> 00:26:38,850
To be honest, that was a lie.

524
00:26:38,918 --> 00:26:42,121
Found these in his bass case.

525
00:26:42,188 --> 00:26:43,355
"For relief of pain,"

526
00:26:43,423 --> 00:26:45,957
"for relief of pain,"
"for relief of pain."

527
00:26:46,026 --> 00:26:49,128
Wow. You're in a lot of pain.

528
00:26:49,195 --> 00:26:51,096
They're for my patients.

529
00:26:51,164 --> 00:26:53,065
Yeah, they all have
different names on them.

530
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:55,734
Different girls' names.
We're gonna hold onto them.

531
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:57,403
And you, while we run this down,

532
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,604
let's go.

533
00:27:02,942 --> 00:27:04,676
Auditions.

534
00:27:04,744 --> 00:27:06,478
Why would you wanna be a
guy who was shot to death?

535
00:27:06,546 --> 00:27:08,414
Drank his way out. In london.

536
00:27:08,481 --> 00:27:10,416
Shot to death in rome.

537
00:27:10,483 --> 00:27:12,984
By that fashion model?
Yeah, that's right.

538
00:27:13,053 --> 00:27:14,819
No no no no no. That was the other guy.

539
00:27:14,887 --> 00:27:16,388
No, it was jude hays.

540
00:27:16,456 --> 00:27:19,024
Went through his grave
when i was in italy.

541
00:27:19,092 --> 00:27:20,459
When were you in italy?

542
00:27:20,527 --> 00:27:22,961
When, uh, you were in prison.

543
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:24,129
His wife's idea.

544
00:27:24,197 --> 00:27:26,932
How was it? Hot.

545
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:30,802
Prison too.

546
00:27:32,905 --> 00:27:35,374
Drank himself to death.

547
00:27:35,442 --> 00:27:36,841
Okay.

548
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:39,311
I'm sure he drank himself to death.

549
00:27:39,379 --> 00:27:41,480
And you talking about people
drinking themselves to death

550
00:27:41,548 --> 00:27:43,782
really isn't helping me study.

551
00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:46,185
Oh, because of you and, um...

552
00:27:46,252 --> 00:27:48,454
yeah, because of me and...

553
00:27:52,592 --> 00:27:56,895
i'm just gonna go to bed.

554
00:28:05,972 --> 00:28:09,007
I do love you.

555
00:28:09,075 --> 00:28:12,077
Of course i love you.

556
00:28:12,145 --> 00:28:16,582
How could you ask me that?
I will always love you.

557
00:28:16,649 --> 00:28:20,285
But you have to know
it's not you, it's me.

558
00:28:20,353 --> 00:28:22,454
Okay.

559
00:28:22,522 --> 00:28:26,291
I'm gonna say good-bye now.

560
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:35,100
You don't have to do this.

561
00:28:35,168 --> 00:28:36,835
If you're not coming with me,

562
00:28:36,902 --> 00:28:40,939
i don't think i wanna go there.

563
00:28:41,007 --> 00:28:42,641
Come to bed.

564
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:43,975
I'm not done with this.

565
00:28:44,043 --> 00:28:46,512
Come to bed.

566
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:48,947
I'm not done with you either.

567
00:29:01,427 --> 00:29:03,195
You ruined it for me.

568
00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:04,630
I had a perfectly good
nickname for partner,

569
00:29:04,697 --> 00:29:08,133
and now i wanna call
you doc, and, you know...

570
00:29:08,201 --> 00:29:10,369
that just ruins it.

571
00:29:10,436 --> 00:29:12,137
Found these in your car.

572
00:29:12,205 --> 00:29:13,372
We got a warrant,

573
00:29:13,439 --> 00:29:15,707
a witness id'ing you
at the murder scene.

574
00:29:15,775 --> 00:29:17,709
It's the kind of thing
the d.a. Likes to hear.

575
00:29:17,777 --> 00:29:19,878
I left with the band. I
didn't come back that night.

576
00:29:19,945 --> 00:29:22,113
There's a different name
on each of those bottles.

577
00:29:22,182 --> 00:29:24,816
I told you, they're
for... your patients.

578
00:29:24,884 --> 00:29:27,553
But we checked. These women don't exist.

579
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,388
You're writing prescriptions
for pain killers,

580
00:29:29,455 --> 00:29:31,290
good pain killers too.

581
00:29:31,357 --> 00:29:32,791
For women that don't exist.

582
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:33,992
Now, what kind of pain

583
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,860
could a woman that doesn't exist be in?

584
00:29:35,928 --> 00:29:37,862
You know, i've been thinking about

585
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:40,932
all those marks on your wall,
doc, about all those women

586
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,735
and you, and...

587
00:29:43,803 --> 00:29:46,305
you say it?

588
00:29:46,372 --> 00:29:47,906
About uncapping your sharpie.

589
00:29:47,973 --> 00:29:51,510
You use these to sweeten
the deal, and then

590
00:29:51,578 --> 00:29:52,977
mitch wagner finds out
about that you've been

591
00:29:53,045 --> 00:29:54,846
trading pills for sex and...

592
00:29:54,914 --> 00:29:57,316
i may have been a tad liberal
with my prescription pad.

593
00:29:57,383 --> 00:29:59,318
But i didn't kill mitch.

594
00:29:59,385 --> 00:30:00,719
I have an alibi.

595
00:30:00,786 --> 00:30:02,187
Yeah, she said she was with you.

596
00:30:02,255 --> 00:30:04,256
But, you know, now we're thinking

597
00:30:04,324 --> 00:30:07,326
her memory might be in question, doc.

598
00:30:07,393 --> 00:30:09,994
Even if your alibi holds,

599
00:30:10,062 --> 00:30:12,297
you're still gonna get
five years for the pills.

600
00:30:12,365 --> 00:30:16,602
Longer if one of the
women brings charges.

601
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:22,341
Something you two should see.

602
00:30:26,613 --> 00:30:29,648
The dna came back on this.

603
00:30:29,716 --> 00:30:31,516
The victim's saliva and
skin are all over it,

604
00:30:31,584 --> 00:30:32,951
which makes sense.

605
00:30:33,018 --> 00:30:36,688
There was, however, also
unknown saliva, so...

606
00:30:36,756 --> 00:30:38,557
it was used to kill someone else.

607
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:43,161
Or the killer tried it on first.

608
00:30:43,229 --> 00:30:45,063
Just to see how it felt.

609
00:30:45,131 --> 00:30:48,867
Get dna from all the suspects.

610
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:59,244
Tyler sims?

611
00:30:59,312 --> 00:31:00,612
Your name may be jude hays,

612
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,748
but we need a sample from tyler sims.

613
00:31:02,815 --> 00:31:06,351
So put the torch down,
and lift up your mask.

614
00:31:18,873 --> 00:31:21,107
jude said he needed some time off.

615
00:31:21,175 --> 00:31:22,609
He say where he was spending it?

616
00:31:22,677 --> 00:31:23,944
He did not.

617
00:31:24,011 --> 00:31:26,179
You got his cell phone on file?

618
00:31:26,247 --> 00:31:29,683
Let me go grab it for you.

619
00:31:29,751 --> 00:31:31,251
You think he'll pick up when we call?

620
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:33,787
No. Not when we call.

621
00:31:33,855 --> 00:31:38,992
Here you go, mrs. Wagner.

622
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:42,830
I thought about what you said.

623
00:32:07,088 --> 00:32:09,490
Hands in the air.

624
00:32:14,161 --> 00:32:16,262
We're gonna need a little
sample from you, tyler.

625
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:20,767
Why do you need a sample from me?

626
00:32:20,835 --> 00:32:22,268
What the hell is that?

627
00:32:22,336 --> 00:32:26,740
That's what got wrapped
around mitch wagner's head.

628
00:32:26,808 --> 00:32:29,275
What's this on it? It's
got a few things on it.

629
00:32:29,343 --> 00:32:32,880
It's got mitch on it. It's
got someone else on it too.

630
00:32:32,947 --> 00:32:34,882
That's why we need a sample from you.

631
00:32:34,949 --> 00:32:39,085
This is what killed him?

632
00:32:42,056 --> 00:32:43,557
It's okay, you can touch it.

633
00:32:48,897 --> 00:32:53,066
Looks like a mask.

634
00:32:53,134 --> 00:32:55,301
I need to get something from my house.

635
00:32:55,369 --> 00:32:56,670
What's that, tyler?

636
00:32:56,738 --> 00:32:58,371
Fan mail.

637
00:32:58,439 --> 00:32:59,973
Fan mail?

638
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:03,076
Fan mail.

639
00:33:03,144 --> 00:33:06,013
Girls send their panties

640
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,548
to the lead singer of a cover band?

641
00:33:07,615 --> 00:33:11,484
When are you gonna just
put those back on the table?

642
00:33:11,553 --> 00:33:16,089
They're probably used.

643
00:33:16,157 --> 00:33:19,760
Just put them down.

644
00:33:19,827 --> 00:33:21,028
I should have been a rock star.

645
00:33:21,095 --> 00:33:22,395
And the band would be?

646
00:33:22,463 --> 00:33:24,731
The tidwells. The tidwells.

647
00:33:28,302 --> 00:33:30,837
Lots of love letters.

648
00:33:30,905 --> 00:33:33,173
Everyone loved tyler... i mean, jude.

649
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,841
'cause that's who they're addressed to.

650
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:37,844
Not everyone. Got one
here addressed to tyler.

651
00:33:41,883 --> 00:33:45,786
"Your face is not his
face. Your face is a lie.

652
00:33:45,853 --> 00:33:47,287
Take it off."

653
00:33:47,354 --> 00:33:49,189
Any return address?

654
00:33:49,256 --> 00:33:51,024
Postmarked to central post office.

655
00:33:51,092 --> 00:33:54,527
Got something else in here.

656
00:33:54,596 --> 00:33:58,865
No makeup on that.

657
00:33:58,933 --> 00:34:02,368
This must have been the warning.

658
00:34:02,436 --> 00:34:06,206
But somebody has been
stalking hot lead for a while.

659
00:34:06,273 --> 00:34:08,942
Maybe they love to trail.

660
00:34:11,112 --> 00:34:12,779
Okay.

661
00:34:12,847 --> 00:34:15,215
So we have all the
ticket lists coming in

662
00:34:15,282 --> 00:34:16,850
from all the theaters
where hot lead played.

663
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:20,053
But if the stalker
were going to the shows,

664
00:34:20,121 --> 00:34:22,555
he probably didn't use his real name.

665
00:34:22,624 --> 00:34:23,890
Or even the same name twice.

666
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:25,525
'cause if there was a
stalker in the crowd,

667
00:34:25,593 --> 00:34:28,662
i need to ask the crowd.

668
00:34:33,801 --> 00:34:35,602
It's you.

669
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,570
You take a good picture, you know that?

670
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,606
Very photogenic.

671
00:34:39,674 --> 00:34:41,975
I can send this to
you right off of here.

672
00:34:42,043 --> 00:34:44,745
And you could print it.

673
00:34:44,812 --> 00:34:47,948
Or i can just erase it.

674
00:34:48,016 --> 00:34:50,751
I'll just erase it.

675
00:34:50,818 --> 00:34:53,754
I, uh, did what you asked.

676
00:34:53,821 --> 00:34:56,523
I got in touch with other hot lead fans.

677
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,858
What you want is in there.

678
00:34:57,925 --> 00:35:01,261
Concert photos close to the stage.

679
00:35:01,328 --> 00:35:04,831
Well, they would have
wanted to be close.

680
00:35:04,899 --> 00:35:07,968
Someone who looks like a
fan, but is really obsessed.

681
00:35:08,036 --> 00:35:11,538
Bapple.

682
00:35:11,605 --> 00:35:12,706
Bapple?

683
00:35:12,774 --> 00:35:16,376
Or papple. Don't ask.

684
00:35:16,443 --> 00:35:19,680
D-do you know who you're looking for?

685
00:35:19,747 --> 00:35:23,950
Well, it could be anyone, really.

686
00:35:24,018 --> 00:35:28,254
It could be you, patty.

687
00:35:38,532 --> 00:35:42,368
But it's not.

688
00:35:43,905 --> 00:35:46,306
It's...al.

689
00:35:46,373 --> 00:35:49,876
Here too, in this one.

690
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,847
Yeah, he's here too.

691
00:35:53,915 --> 00:35:58,551
Al... but that's not possible.

692
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:00,220
He... he's just al.

693
00:36:00,287 --> 00:36:01,654
Where were these pictures taken, patty?

694
00:36:01,723 --> 00:36:05,558
Uh, this is seattle,

695
00:36:05,626 --> 00:36:10,430
this is san diego, this one is new york.

696
00:36:14,168 --> 00:36:15,902
Reese?

697
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,771
Where would a homeless
guy get the money to follow

698
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,906
a cover band all over the country?

699
00:36:38,008 --> 00:36:41,911
Why'd you take the cards?

700
00:36:41,979 --> 00:36:45,248
From the shrine.

701
00:36:45,316 --> 00:36:47,283
I get the banana bread, the cash.

702
00:36:47,351 --> 00:36:49,785
I get the lighters, the bracelets.

703
00:36:49,853 --> 00:36:53,889
But why take the cards?
They're not worth anything.

704
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:58,061
But they were written to jude hays.

705
00:36:58,128 --> 00:36:59,695
That's right.

706
00:36:59,763 --> 00:37:00,997
They are.

707
00:37:01,065 --> 00:37:04,667
Oh, so they belong to you?

708
00:37:04,734 --> 00:37:05,701
You know, we got something else

709
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:07,236
that belongs to you...

710
00:37:07,304 --> 00:37:10,906
a piece of plastic with
a dead man's face on it.

711
00:37:10,975 --> 00:37:16,012
We're gonna need a
d.n.a. Sample from you.

712
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,382
His face was a lie so
he had to take it off?

713
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:23,086
What about your face?

714
00:37:23,153 --> 00:37:25,121
No.

715
00:37:25,189 --> 00:37:28,992
My face is not a lie.

716
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:32,095
My face is rock and roll.

717
00:37:32,162 --> 00:37:33,529
All right. Let's take it easy, okay?

718
00:37:33,597 --> 00:37:34,864
Okay.

719
00:37:34,931 --> 00:37:37,200
Okay.

720
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:40,003
They sing like him. They look like him.

721
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,305
But they are not him.

722
00:37:42,373 --> 00:37:45,841
They... they...

723
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:49,479
they... they... they are a lie.

724
00:37:52,149 --> 00:37:53,782
Al, i need you to help
me out with something

725
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:54,917
for a moment.

726
00:37:54,985 --> 00:37:56,552
There's some confusion at the station.

727
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,921
Yeah? About what?

728
00:37:58,989 --> 00:38:01,190
About how jude hays died.

729
00:38:01,258 --> 00:38:03,159
Everyone seems to have
a different version.

730
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:05,328
Hmm. So maybe you can help me out.

731
00:38:05,396 --> 00:38:09,532
How exactly did jude hays go?

732
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,667
Was it in a plane crash?

733
00:38:11,735 --> 00:38:14,337
Did he o.d.?

734
00:38:14,405 --> 00:38:16,339
was he stabbed by that model?

735
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:24,514
He didn't die.

736
00:38:24,581 --> 00:38:26,916
Did he?

737
00:38:29,553 --> 00:38:32,055
No, he didn't.

738
00:38:32,122 --> 00:38:36,392
He's been here the whole time.

739
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,328
How did you get mitch
back here that night?

740
00:38:39,396 --> 00:38:43,066
With all his makeup on?

741
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:45,234
You told him who you were.

742
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:11,627
Rock and roll, baby.

743
00:39:11,695 --> 00:39:13,329
Rock and roll.

744
00:39:13,397 --> 00:39:16,699
Good night, l.a.!

745
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:24,574
do you really think that's jude hays?

746
00:39:24,641 --> 00:39:26,709
How are you gonna prove it?

747
00:39:26,776 --> 00:39:28,411
There's a jude hays
shirt in the rock and roll

748
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:30,746
hall of fame.

749
00:39:30,814 --> 00:39:34,350
From a concert he did in
tokyo that took six hours.

750
00:39:34,418 --> 00:39:38,887
Six hours? That's a lot of sweat.

751
00:39:38,955 --> 00:39:40,923
That's a lot of d.n.a.

752
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:50,566
That's a lot of hate.

753
00:40:24,901 --> 00:40:26,035
What?

754
00:40:31,107 --> 00:40:33,576
Charlie, about me and your father

755
00:40:33,644 --> 00:40:36,279
and your father's fiancee, olivia...

756
00:40:36,346 --> 00:40:38,514
if you love her, ted,
you should tell her.

757
00:40:38,582 --> 00:40:41,517
Just stop telling me about her.

758
00:40:41,585 --> 00:40:44,620
So the real jude hays,
living in that alley.

759
00:40:44,688 --> 00:40:46,789
Eh, just spending time there.

760
00:40:46,856 --> 00:40:48,524
He kept a bunch of hotel
rooms in different names

761
00:40:48,592 --> 00:40:49,692
all over the city.

762
00:40:49,759 --> 00:40:51,727
And those other two, tyler and patty,

763
00:40:51,795 --> 00:40:52,795
formed their own band?

764
00:40:52,862 --> 00:40:58,334
Yeah. The two judes.

765
00:40:58,402 --> 00:41:00,203
I'm proud of you.

766
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,538
Proud of you, charlie.

767
00:41:02,606 --> 00:41:04,373
You don't need to be driving
a car with bullet holes

768
00:41:04,441 --> 00:41:09,245
in it.

769
00:41:09,313 --> 00:41:11,046
You sure she's gonna show?

770
00:41:11,114 --> 00:41:13,249
Well, she said she'd be here.

771
00:41:13,317 --> 00:41:14,983
But you know women.

772
00:41:15,051 --> 00:41:17,920
No, not really.

773
00:41:17,987 --> 00:41:22,658
Neither do i.

774
00:41:22,726 --> 00:41:26,462
Is that...

775
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:30,233
my car?

776
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,270
Looks like...

777
00:41:34,338 --> 00:41:36,905
my car.

778
00:41:36,973 --> 00:41:39,575
What did she do to it?

779
00:41:39,643 --> 00:41:44,213
She painted it, ted.

780
00:41:44,281 --> 00:41:49,952
Why would she do that?

781
00:41:50,019 --> 00:41:52,722
This is your car. The one you gave me.

782
00:41:53,823 --> 00:41:57,960
I just painted some flowers on it.

783
00:41:58,027 --> 00:42:02,465
It's the same underneath.

784
00:42:02,532 --> 00:42:05,401
Say something.

785
00:42:05,469 --> 00:42:06,802
Bapple.
