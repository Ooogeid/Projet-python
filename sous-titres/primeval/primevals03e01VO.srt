1
00:00:45,405 --> 00:00:47,565
Anybody there?

2
00:00:56,574 --> 00:00:58,534
You're losing your mind, dear !

3
00:01:57,814 --> 00:02:00,334
I assume you've been fully briefed?
Yes, sir.

4
00:02:00,334 --> 00:02:03,574
Your job's to tighten up security
in every area of the ARC.

5
00:02:03,574 --> 00:02:07,094
As you may know, we've had a number
of unfortunate lapses recently.

6
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:09,174
I'm aware of that.

7
00:02:09,174 --> 00:02:11,374
You're also aware
of the work we do here?

8
00:02:11,374 --> 00:02:13,974
You detect anomalies
and fight dinosaurs.

9
00:02:13,974 --> 00:02:15,934
When necessary.

10
00:02:16,974 --> 00:02:19,054
Correct. You don't sound surprised.

11
00:02:19,054 --> 00:02:21,774
I have extensive experience
in dinosaur handling, sir.

12
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:24,454
I assumed that was why
I was picked for the job !

13
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:29,174
I take it that's some sort of joke?
Yes, sir.

14
00:02:29,174 --> 00:02:31,894
A lot of people are sceptical
when they join us, Becker.

15
00:02:31,894 --> 00:02:33,534
They don't stay that way for long.

16
00:02:34,574 --> 00:02:36,614
And, in future, I'll do the jokes.

17
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,574
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

18
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:44,014
You'll be with a highly strung
and temperamental team

19
00:02:44,014 --> 00:02:47,494
of rank amateurs who just happen
to be brilliant at what they do.

20
00:02:47,494 --> 00:02:50,374
Your job's to stop them
getting themselves killed.

21
00:02:50,374 --> 00:02:52,814
No matter what they say,
what excuses they use,

22
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:54,894
you and your men
will stick to them like glue.

23
00:02:55,974 --> 00:02:58,254
We can't afford
another Stephen Heart. Clear?

24
00:02:58,254 --> 00:02:59,934
Crystal clear, sir.

25
00:03:01,734 --> 00:03:03,694
Good luck.

26
00:03:05,054 --> 00:03:07,694
Oh, by the way.
Professor Cutter won't like you

27
00:03:07,694 --> 00:03:10,294
and he'll go out of his way to make
your job impossible.

28
00:03:11,334 --> 00:03:13,174
Try not to take it personally.

29
00:03:21,014 --> 00:03:24,054
And that's the story
of Rameses the second.

30
00:03:24,054 --> 00:03:26,694
Now, this...this is Anubis.

31
00:03:26,694 --> 00:03:29,054
The Egyptian god of embalming.

32
00:03:29,054 --> 00:03:31,134
Now, when you died...

33
00:03:31,134 --> 00:03:33,774
they'd pull your brains out
from inside your nose,

34
00:03:33,774 --> 00:03:35,334
using one of these.

35
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:39,694
Then, Anubis would rip out...
your bleeding heart.

36
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:42,694
Now, if you hadn't been very good...

37
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:45,774
..the demon goddess Ammut...

38
00:03:45,774 --> 00:03:47,894
would eat it.

39
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,174
And then you're doomed
to spend eternity...

40
00:03:51,214 --> 00:03:52,454
..in the underworld.

41
00:03:56,014 --> 00:03:58,214
Erm...well, the museum's closed now.

42
00:03:58,214 --> 00:04:01,254
But I hope you all had a great day.

43
00:04:02,294 --> 00:04:04,054
Thank you.

44
00:04:05,414 --> 00:04:07,854
Marion...
Whatever you want, the answer's no.

45
00:04:08,894 --> 00:04:11,374
That jacket is gorgeous. Is it new?

46
00:04:11,374 --> 00:04:15,134
See this? All these items
have got to be ticked off overnight.

47
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:18,534
We've got three exhibitions to move,
redress two others.

48
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:21,134
The Sun Cage is already prepped
for transportation.

49
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:23,214
Well, that's...

50
00:04:23,214 --> 00:04:26,454
really good, cos the museum director
told me I had until opening time

51
00:04:26,454 --> 00:04:28,534
tomorrow to finish my work.

52
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:31,534
Come on, Marion. I've got one
final section left to study.

53
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:33,614
Right there.

54
00:04:33,614 --> 00:04:37,374
With respect, Sarah, the greatest
Egyptologists of the 20th century

55
00:04:37,374 --> 00:04:40,334
decoded those hieroglyphics
decades ago.

56
00:04:40,334 --> 00:04:42,774
And they were much
more qualified than you.

57
00:04:42,774 --> 00:04:45,654
And some of those translations
have never made sense.

58
00:04:45,654 --> 00:04:48,134
All I'm asking is to let me
check it out for myself.

59
00:04:48,134 --> 00:04:50,534
Sorry. This exhibition is closed.
I'm moving on.

60
00:04:55,054 --> 00:04:57,014
(Witch!)

61
00:05:06,894 --> 00:05:09,894
'Stephen!'

62
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:12,894
'Stephen, open the door!'

63
00:05:12,894 --> 00:05:15,254
'Stephen? No, open the door!'

64
00:05:15,254 --> 00:05:16,894
'Open it!'

65
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:18,414
Cutter?

66
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:23,334
Don't you ever go home? You can't
take this personally, you know.

67
00:05:24,414 --> 00:05:26,934
No-one blames you.
For what?

68
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:28,974
For what happened to Stephen.

69
00:05:28,974 --> 00:05:30,854
It wasn't your fault.

70
00:05:32,614 --> 00:05:34,854
Yeah, I know. It was Helen's.

71
00:05:34,854 --> 00:05:37,254
Then, why are you blaming yourself?

72
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,894
Because I should have stopped her.
That's my job.

73
00:05:40,734 --> 00:05:42,694
But you can't change the past.

74
00:05:44,494 --> 00:05:46,574
Yeah.

75
00:05:46,574 --> 00:05:49,414
You don't know the half of it,
Claudia Brown !

76
00:05:50,814 --> 00:05:52,774
OK. I'm out of here.

77
00:05:56,374 --> 00:05:58,414
Do you want to get something to eat?

78
00:05:58,414 --> 00:06:00,374
I'm starving.

79
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:19,494
What on earth...?

80
00:06:43,294 --> 00:06:45,494
Perfect timing !

81
00:06:48,494 --> 00:06:50,774
Yeah.
We've got another one.

82
00:06:50,774 --> 00:06:52,934
Where?
Meet me in the British Museum.

83
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:54,774
OK.

84
00:06:55,814 --> 00:06:58,374
Connor! We've got a new one.

85
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:02,814
Mm.

86
00:07:08,534 --> 00:07:10,454
We need to move.
I need some help, Rex.

87
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,054
Rex.

88
00:07:14,054 --> 00:07:16,374
Breakfast.

89
00:07:25,534 --> 00:07:27,614
Oh... Oh!

90
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,614
Eurgh!

91
00:07:29,614 --> 00:07:31,574
Rex.

92
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:34,734
Morning, mate.

93
00:07:49,894 --> 00:07:52,614
Connor Temple, Abby Maitland...

94
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:55,934
This is Captain Becker. He's here
to protect us, so do as he says.

95
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:00,614
Unless I think he's wrong.

96
00:08:01,654 --> 00:08:02,694
This way.

97
00:08:17,054 --> 00:08:19,134
CONNOR: You know, when I was a kid,

98
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:22,974
I used to think that all
the exhibits came to life at night.

99
00:08:22,974 --> 00:08:27,934
When I was about eight, I decided
to stay behind one night, find out.

100
00:08:29,574 --> 00:08:31,854
ABBY: What happened?

101
00:08:31,854 --> 00:08:33,614
Nothing...really.

102
00:08:34,694 --> 00:08:37,214
Apart from I got locked
in the toilet for three hours.

103
00:08:37,214 --> 00:08:39,254
It's not funny.

104
00:08:39,254 --> 00:08:41,174
When they found me,
I was hysterical.

105
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:45,374
I've had a problem with...
museums ever since.

106
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:47,854
Shouldn't you have
a problem with toilets?

107
00:08:47,854 --> 00:08:49,814
Got over that.

108
00:09:07,894 --> 00:09:09,854
It's an animal kill.

109
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:14,934
It could be anywhere
in the museum by now.

110
00:09:32,484 --> 00:09:34,604
I really don't like this place.

111
00:09:56,724 --> 00:09:59,444
BECKER: Which way now?

112
00:10:02,044 --> 00:10:04,284
Go, go, go!

113
00:10:07,884 --> 00:10:09,924
CUTTER: Stay where you are!

114
00:10:09,924 --> 00:10:11,844
Stay where you are!

115
00:10:15,084 --> 00:10:16,964
It's all right.

116
00:10:18,124 --> 00:10:19,284
Who are you?

117
00:10:20,484 --> 00:10:22,524
Doc...Doctor Page.

118
00:10:22,524 --> 00:10:24,444
Who are you?

119
00:10:24,444 --> 00:10:25,764
I'm Nick Cutter.

120
00:10:27,444 --> 00:10:29,404
OK. Um...

121
00:10:30,844 --> 00:10:33,124
I'm...I'm guessing...

122
00:10:33,124 --> 00:10:35,964
you're some kind of...of thief.

123
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:38,364
No. Actually, I'm a professor.

124
00:10:42,324 --> 00:10:44,684
I've never seen a professor
with a gun before.

125
00:10:44,684 --> 00:10:47,244
Yeah.
It's a pretty specialised field.

126
00:11:03,484 --> 00:11:05,444
Marion!

127
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,364
CONNOR: Professor?

128
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:15,124
Dr Page?

129
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:17,004
BECKER: Move it!

130
00:11:30,644 --> 00:11:32,604
Dr Page!

131
00:12:03,444 --> 00:12:05,404
Who's there?

132
00:12:06,484 --> 00:12:08,484
Who's there?!

133
00:12:18,164 --> 00:12:20,004
Aargh!

134
00:12:31,844 --> 00:12:33,644
Aargh!

135
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:52,044
Aargh!

136
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:10,884
You OK?

137
00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:15,284
I'm guessing not.

138
00:13:15,284 --> 00:13:17,444
What did you see?

139
00:13:19,644 --> 00:13:21,684
Ammut.

140
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:24,244
I saw...I saw the goddess Ammut.

141
00:13:26,884 --> 00:13:30,364
Look. I know what I saw. OK?
And...and it looked...

142
00:13:30,364 --> 00:13:33,164
It looked like that.
Look. I believe you saw something.

143
00:13:33,164 --> 00:13:36,964
I've seen things that confused me,
too. I just don't think it was Ammut.

144
00:13:39,564 --> 00:13:42,124
I've found tracks.
Biped and quadruped.

145
00:13:42,124 --> 00:13:45,284
It's heading south.
I've got to get back to the ARC.

146
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:46,804
The ark?
Not that one.

147
00:13:46,804 --> 00:13:49,884
I'm gonna brief Lester.
Becker, can you secure the area?

148
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,524
Connor? Stay and work out
what period the anomaly's linked to.

149
00:13:54,524 --> 00:13:58,004
And find out what Dr Page knows
about the Sun Cage.

150
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,044
Abby? You're with me.

151
00:14:04,924 --> 00:14:06,884
I bet I can read your mind.

152
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:11,684
You wanna know who we are,
what the ARC is,

153
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,964
and what the big flickering thing
is behind me.

154
00:14:13,964 --> 00:14:16,004
Actually um...

155
00:14:16,004 --> 00:14:18,084
I was wondering why...

156
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:20,604
an Egyptian demon
was trying to eat me.

157
00:14:22,164 --> 00:14:24,644
'Sir? It's Whitehall.

158
00:14:24,644 --> 00:14:26,564
I have Christine Johnson
on line one.'

159
00:14:30,164 --> 00:14:32,404
Christine.
What an unexpected pleasure.

160
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:35,404
James.
How lovely to hear your voice.

161
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:38,244
I thought you were running
the MI6 station in Jamaica.

162
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,644
I'm back in London.
I missed the rain.

163
00:14:41,684 --> 00:14:43,084
Let's have lunch.

164
00:14:43,084 --> 00:14:45,164
It's a charming offer, Christine.

165
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:47,644
Unfortunately, I am rather busy
just at the moment.

166
00:14:47,644 --> 00:14:49,884
I have some news for you.

167
00:14:49,884 --> 00:14:53,244
The minister has put me in charge
of military liaison with the ARC.

168
00:14:57,084 --> 00:14:59,124
He didn't say anything to me
about it.

169
00:14:59,124 --> 00:15:01,724
Oh, didn't he? I'm sure
there's an e-mail on its way.

170
00:15:01,724 --> 00:15:03,604
We need to meet for a briefing.

171
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:06,004
'How does this morning sound?'

172
00:15:06,004 --> 00:15:08,084
'Like irritatingly bad timing.'

173
00:15:08,084 --> 00:15:10,244
I'd forgotten how funny you are,
James.

174
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:12,404
I'll see you in an hour.
'Well, actually - '

175
00:15:12,404 --> 00:15:14,684
We've got a problem.

176
00:15:14,684 --> 00:15:16,924
So have I.
It's called Christine Johnson.

177
00:15:16,924 --> 00:15:18,884
A velociraptor,
but better dressed.

178
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,324
James, a creature has escaped
through the anomaly.

179
00:15:21,324 --> 00:15:23,564
What is it?
We don't know.

180
00:15:23,564 --> 00:15:27,164
Can't you look its picture up in
your Big Book Of Dinosaurs (?) Where?

181
00:15:27,164 --> 00:15:29,724
We don't know.

182
00:15:29,724 --> 00:15:31,804
Morning rush hour.

183
00:15:31,804 --> 00:15:34,044
And a creature loose
on the streets of London.

184
00:15:34,044 --> 00:15:36,204
Oh, wonderful !
Cutter's tracking it now.

185
00:15:36,204 --> 00:15:38,284
We have the anomaly site secured.

186
00:15:38,284 --> 00:15:40,604
But there's...something else.
Yeah?

187
00:15:40,604 --> 00:15:43,964
There was an eyewitness.
Erm, a young woman at the museum.

188
00:15:43,964 --> 00:15:47,484
Well, you know. Have her shot
and dispose of her body discreetly.

189
00:15:48,524 --> 00:15:50,364
Just kidding.

190
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:30,804
So, Dr Page. What do
these hieroglyphs refer to?

191
00:16:30,804 --> 00:16:32,884
That's what I've been...working on.

192
00:16:33,964 --> 00:16:37,124
But there are so many
unanswered questions.

193
00:16:37,124 --> 00:16:39,164
Key fragments that are missing.

194
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,644
And I've been trying
to figure it all out.

195
00:16:41,644 --> 00:16:43,684
If Marion had let me finish...

196
00:16:43,684 --> 00:16:46,724
Ammut would have got me and not her.

197
00:16:46,724 --> 00:16:48,844
I'm sorry. She was your friend?

198
00:16:48,844 --> 00:16:50,924
Oh, no. Not at all.

199
00:16:50,924 --> 00:16:54,964
But, you know. Given a choice,
I wouldn't want her dead.

200
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:58,724
Cutter!

201
00:16:58,724 --> 00:17:00,684
What is it?

202
00:17:07,044 --> 00:17:09,284
CONNOR: Right.
Let's see what we've got here.

203
00:17:28,684 --> 00:17:31,364
I didn't do it.
So, it just...fell off by itself.

204
00:17:32,404 --> 00:17:33,444
Yep.

205
00:17:34,484 --> 00:17:37,244
The Sun Cage...is cursed.

206
00:17:41,364 --> 00:17:43,764
Anyone who touches it is...is...

207
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:45,244
doomed for life.

208
00:17:46,284 --> 00:17:48,084
Really?

209
00:17:49,164 --> 00:17:51,324
Marion was the last person
to touch that.

210
00:17:52,244 --> 00:17:54,364
The dead one?

211
00:17:59,924 --> 00:18:02,564
Should have told you that earlier,
right?

212
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:04,524
Sorry about that. Bad luck.

213
00:18:04,524 --> 00:18:06,884
Bad luck.

214
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,044
I've lost the tracks.

215
00:18:21,044 --> 00:18:23,364
We're going round in circles,
Cutter.

216
00:18:23,364 --> 00:18:25,404
Stephen would have known what to do.

217
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,164
Sorry.

218
00:18:34,204 --> 00:18:36,284
Yo.
'Connor, it's me. What have we got?'

219
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:40,044
I took a reading.
Whatever came through is at least
55 million years old.

220
00:18:40,044 --> 00:18:42,124
Eocene epoch.

221
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:45,604
It's fast, strong, switches from two
legs to four and it's carnivorous.

222
00:18:45,604 --> 00:18:48,084
Search the databases,
profile me some creatures.

223
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:09,604
Cutter...
We're heading south.

224
00:19:09,604 --> 00:19:11,684
'I think we've got him.'

225
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:14,964
Tell him I'm on my way.
Action Man said he's coming.

226
00:19:41,524 --> 00:19:44,804
Hey! Er... What's your name?
Connor. My name's Connor.

227
00:19:44,804 --> 00:19:49,484
It was staring me in the face. These
hieroglyphs have been misunderstood.

228
00:19:49,484 --> 00:19:51,564
The most important section is wrong.

229
00:19:51,564 --> 00:19:54,844
This depicts a monument
on the west bank of the Nile.

230
00:19:54,844 --> 00:19:58,804
Amentet. With what appears to be
the sun rising behind it.

231
00:19:58,804 --> 00:20:02,884
Now, one of Ammut's names is
The Dweller In Amentet.

232
00:20:02,884 --> 00:20:05,244
And I think that this monument...

233
00:20:05,244 --> 00:20:07,084
is the one depicted here.

234
00:20:07,084 --> 00:20:10,324
Except...the sun doesn't rise
in the west.

235
00:20:11,404 --> 00:20:14,564
This...this hieroglyph
has been misinterpreted for years.

236
00:20:14,564 --> 00:20:16,604
This isn't the sun!

237
00:20:16,604 --> 00:20:18,644
It's an anomaly.

238
00:20:18,644 --> 00:20:19,884
Exactly.

239
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:22,724
And the Egyptians called it
the Sun Cage because...

240
00:20:22,724 --> 00:20:26,044
they thought that the rays
of the sun were locked inside.

241
00:20:27,124 --> 00:20:29,084
What is this made of?
What stone is this?

242
00:20:29,084 --> 00:20:30,444
Magnetite.
Which is?

243
00:20:30,444 --> 00:20:33,724
Which is the most magnetic form
of stone...on earth.

244
00:20:39,524 --> 00:20:41,164
I wanna try something.

245
00:20:56,844 --> 00:20:58,644
Perfect!

246
00:20:58,644 --> 00:21:00,444
Everybody ready?

247
00:21:00,444 --> 00:21:02,244
Yeah.
Yeah.

248
00:21:02,244 --> 00:21:03,724
On my count.

249
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,804
One...

250
00:21:06,804 --> 00:21:08,684
two...three.

251
00:21:28,244 --> 00:21:30,284
OK. Leave this. Back to the doors.

252
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:32,364
Right. When the Sun Cage moved...

253
00:21:35,924 --> 00:21:38,604
..so did the anomaly.

254
00:21:38,604 --> 00:21:40,604
Is that unusual?
Very.

255
00:21:40,604 --> 00:21:42,204
Why?

256
00:21:42,204 --> 00:21:44,004
Why would it do that?

257
00:21:45,244 --> 00:21:48,324
That's what this final section
of the hieroglyph refers to.

258
00:21:48,324 --> 00:21:52,164
The Egyptians thought that the..
the anomaly was part of the sun.

259
00:21:52,164 --> 00:21:54,804
So, they built the cage
out of magnetite...

260
00:21:54,804 --> 00:21:56,844
as the only way
they could contain it.

261
00:21:56,844 --> 00:21:59,844
So, wherever the Sun Cage goes,
the anomaly goes too.

262
00:21:59,844 --> 00:22:01,844
Exactly.
Wow.

263
00:22:03,044 --> 00:22:04,524
That's huge.

264
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:06,444
I mean, if it was -

265
00:22:08,604 --> 00:22:11,124
Connor!

266
00:22:11,124 --> 00:22:12,764
Don't pull that trigger!

267
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,564
Throw it!

268
00:22:15,564 --> 00:22:17,804
It's got my belt!

269
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:19,404
Ow!

270
00:22:31,124 --> 00:22:33,084
You nearly let it eat me!

271
00:22:34,124 --> 00:22:35,604
That cat is priceless.

272
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,364
So am I !

273
00:22:41,204 --> 00:22:43,244
How many of those things are there?

274
00:22:43,244 --> 00:22:45,164
I don't know.

275
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,164
Could be hundreds.

276
00:22:48,164 --> 00:22:50,804
We need to get this thing blocked up.

277
00:22:54,604 --> 00:22:56,644
There's no pulse.

278
00:22:56,644 --> 00:22:58,644
He's gone.

279
00:23:00,724 --> 00:23:02,884
BECKER: Professor.
What have we got here?

280
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:04,484
Abby? What do you make of that?

281
00:23:08,564 --> 00:23:10,604
Crocodile tooth.

282
00:23:10,604 --> 00:23:13,084
The river.

283
00:23:45,026 --> 00:23:48,066
Crocodiles usually drag their victims
into water to finish them.

284
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:50,106
So, why did this croc
attack on land?

285
00:23:50,106 --> 00:23:51,706
Why is it walking on two legs?

286
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:56,826
CONNOR: Come on, come on!
What are you?

287
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:59,746
Eocene epoch,
looked like a crocodile. Erm...

288
00:24:02,543 --> 00:24:03,623
Cutter.

289
00:24:03,623 --> 00:24:07,583
Yep. I am just narrowing down the
list of creatures from that era now.

290
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:10,103
I think I know
where you're gonna find it.

291
00:24:10,103 --> 00:24:12,183
Just give me a minute. Oh, yeah.

292
00:24:12,183 --> 00:24:14,423
Yeah. This is definitely the guy.
Hang on.

293
00:24:14,423 --> 00:24:17,823
His name is...
'Pristichampsus.' Bingo.

294
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:21,023
Yep... Looks like the one.

295
00:24:22,983 --> 00:24:26,143
All right. So, it's in the Thames.
But it won't be for long.

296
00:24:26,143 --> 00:24:28,503
It's gonna come ashore,
looking for warmth.

297
00:24:29,903 --> 00:24:31,463
And food !

298
00:24:46,423 --> 00:24:48,383
BLEEP

299
00:24:50,343 --> 00:24:52,103
James.

300
00:24:52,103 --> 00:24:54,703
You're very well guarded.
It's fine.

301
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:56,743
Let him pass.

302
00:24:56,743 --> 00:24:59,023
I'm sorry. I should have thought.

303
00:24:59,023 --> 00:25:01,183
Told them to whisk you
straight through.

304
00:25:01,183 --> 00:25:03,143
Thank you for coming.

305
00:25:05,143 --> 00:25:07,183
I like your suit.

306
00:25:07,183 --> 00:25:08,423
Italian?

307
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,023
Yes. Yep.

308
00:25:10,023 --> 00:25:12,703
It looks great on you.
Matches your eyes.

309
00:25:12,703 --> 00:25:14,743
Shall we?

310
00:25:14,743 --> 00:25:15,823
Yep.

311
00:25:15,823 --> 00:25:19,183
The minister has asked me to
offer you support in any way I can.

312
00:25:19,183 --> 00:25:21,263
What kind of support?
You tell me.

313
00:25:22,303 --> 00:25:24,463
I think we're managing pretty well.

314
00:25:24,463 --> 00:25:26,783
I have to say -
and this isn't my own opinion -

315
00:25:26,783 --> 00:25:28,983
but that's not
the general perception.

316
00:25:28,983 --> 00:25:31,463
There's a feeling
that perhaps the...

317
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:34,303
situation is too extreme
for you to handle alone.

318
00:25:34,303 --> 00:25:36,583
Well, that perception
would be entirely wrong.

319
00:25:37,783 --> 00:25:41,263
Even so. The minister is keen we
allow the military a greater role.

320
00:25:41,263 --> 00:25:43,983
After all, we are on the same side.

321
00:25:43,983 --> 00:25:47,143
I won't tolerate any interference.
Perish the thought, James.

322
00:25:47,143 --> 00:25:49,903
I can't tell you how much
I admire your work. Can't you?

323
00:25:49,903 --> 00:25:51,983
Oh, go on. Give it a go !

324
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:56,223
Maybe later. First, I need briefing
on some operational protocols.

325
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:59,783
I'm so sorry, James. We're going to
have to reschedule. Let's do dinner.

326
00:26:01,663 --> 00:26:03,703
I beg your pardon?
Claire.

327
00:26:03,703 --> 00:26:06,503
Would you mind escorting this
gentleman from the building?

328
00:26:06,503 --> 00:26:09,063
Follow me.
Well, actually...erm...

329
00:26:17,263 --> 00:26:20,023
I told you not to come back here
without it. What happened?

330
00:26:20,023 --> 00:26:22,183
It was a suicide mission.

331
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,543
We got it.

332
00:26:29,543 --> 00:26:31,223
Now let's get out of here.

333
00:27:16,463 --> 00:27:18,703
Go on! Get out!

334
00:27:24,783 --> 00:27:25,903
Come on!

335
00:27:35,303 --> 00:27:37,223
We had to leave it behind.

336
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:39,303
You had one objective, Captain.

337
00:27:39,303 --> 00:27:41,623
You have failed.
With respect, ma'am,

338
00:27:41,623 --> 00:27:43,783
my men died
trying to find that thing.

339
00:27:43,783 --> 00:27:46,503
With respect, Captain,
that is your responsibility.

340
00:27:46,503 --> 00:27:48,183
I want that artefact!

341
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:58,423
If it's been living in Egypt...

342
00:27:58,423 --> 00:28:01,823
the Thames will be much colder
than what it's used to.

343
00:28:01,823 --> 00:28:04,423
It'll be looking to get out
pretty soon.

344
00:28:11,183 --> 00:28:12,743
Make that right now.

345
00:28:31,463 --> 00:28:34,063
It's too slow.
It's all taking too much time.

346
00:28:35,143 --> 00:28:38,983
We need this barricade up before
any more creatures can come through.

347
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,943
What about the forklift?

348
00:28:44,143 --> 00:28:45,943
Forklift.

349
00:28:46,983 --> 00:28:48,743
Why didn't you say that before?

350
00:28:50,343 --> 00:28:53,623
Connor, I...I've been attacked
by prehistoric monsters.

351
00:28:53,623 --> 00:28:56,263
I'm...I'm staring at a gateway
to a distant past.

352
00:28:57,303 --> 00:28:59,143
I really wasn't thinking 'forklift'.

353
00:29:01,023 --> 00:29:03,983
Shoot it!

354
00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:05,423
Keep shooting it!

355
00:29:06,943 --> 00:29:08,983
Connor, do something!

356
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:17,463
Connor!

357
00:29:29,863 --> 00:29:31,943
That's never happened before.

358
00:29:31,943 --> 00:29:34,703
What?
That.

359
00:29:46,863 --> 00:29:50,743
Usually, the magnetic pull sucks
anything metallic straight through.

360
00:29:50,743 --> 00:29:53,943
It's the electric current.
It must have done something to it.

361
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:00,903
OK. I'll figure it out later.

362
00:30:00,903 --> 00:30:02,823
We need to get these boxes back up!

363
00:30:43,743 --> 00:30:46,503
If your first tranquiliser dart
doesn't floor this thing,

364
00:30:46,503 --> 00:30:48,823
we have no option
but to use live rounds.

365
00:30:48,823 --> 00:30:50,903
OK, Professor?

366
00:30:50,903 --> 00:30:53,623
Please - tell me
we haven't lost it again.

367
00:30:55,823 --> 00:30:57,463
Apparently not.

368
00:31:28,663 --> 00:31:30,623
Where is it?

369
00:31:44,783 --> 00:31:46,263
Upstairs?

370
00:31:47,903 --> 00:31:49,943
Yeah.
We need to get these people out.

371
00:31:49,943 --> 00:31:53,503
Ladies and gentlemen, can you follow
us, for your own safety? Thank you.

372
00:32:00,943 --> 00:32:03,263
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you'd just follow me.

373
00:32:03,263 --> 00:32:05,743
I promise you,
there's nothing to worry about.

374
00:32:05,743 --> 00:32:08,623
You know how these charity fun runs
can go way out of control.

375
00:32:42,623 --> 00:32:44,783
Go on, go on!
Abby?!

376
00:32:45,823 --> 00:32:48,023
For God's sake, shoot it!

377
00:32:55,343 --> 00:32:57,303
Sorry.

378
00:33:12,983 --> 00:33:14,543
Hey!

379
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:15,863
Cutter!

380
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:19,743
Hey!

381
00:33:29,783 --> 00:33:31,463
It's OK, it's OK.

382
00:33:31,463 --> 00:33:33,383
Come, come, come.

383
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:51,103
No, just hang on. You'll be fine.

384
00:33:52,143 --> 00:33:54,463
Oh, Cutter!

385
00:34:05,863 --> 00:34:07,863
Are you OK?
Yes.

386
00:34:07,863 --> 00:34:10,023
Just enjoying the view.

387
00:34:14,263 --> 00:34:17,903
Seems it's heading for the river.
It probably wants to go home.

388
00:34:32,393 --> 00:34:34,873
OK. Nothing...
is getting through there.

389
00:34:36,753 --> 00:34:38,673
It's Cutter.

390
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:42,913
Hello. 'Looks like Pristichampsus
is heading your way.'

391
00:34:42,913 --> 00:34:44,993
'So, make sure
it can get to the anomaly.'

392
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:52,833
I am SO...cursed.

393
00:34:55,313 --> 00:34:57,113
Everything on this side has to go.

394
00:34:58,153 --> 00:34:59,513
Completely.

395
00:35:05,073 --> 00:35:08,913
And these two. It's following its own
scent. Coming through those doors.

396
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:13,713
We need to get that open.

397
00:35:20,553 --> 00:35:21,713
Last few.

398
00:35:33,913 --> 00:35:35,433
Connor, I can't see it.

399
00:35:41,313 --> 00:35:45,993
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!
It's come through the other door.

400
00:35:52,713 --> 00:35:54,553
Connor! Out of the way!

401
00:36:00,353 --> 00:36:03,353
Guys...please, just get it back
through the anomaly.

402
00:36:03,353 --> 00:36:05,513
Don't...shoot it.

403
00:36:05,513 --> 00:36:07,313
It's my job to keep you alive.

404
00:36:07,313 --> 00:36:10,273
Aargh! I'm too young to die.

405
00:36:12,793 --> 00:36:15,313
It's injured. It wants to go home.

406
00:36:15,313 --> 00:36:17,433
I don't know how long I can hold on,
Cutter.

407
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:18,393
Bow!

408
00:36:19,393 --> 00:36:21,393
What?
Bow down.

409
00:36:21,393 --> 00:36:23,473
What are you talking about?

410
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:27,193
This creature is...is used to
being treated like a god.

411
00:36:27,193 --> 00:36:30,393
They would have bowed
as a sign of respect.

412
00:36:30,393 --> 00:36:32,553
If it doesn't think
we're a threat...

413
00:36:32,553 --> 00:36:34,553
it might not attack.

414
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:37,673
I'm not bowing.

415
00:36:37,673 --> 00:36:39,593
Get down on the floor.
What?

416
00:36:39,593 --> 00:36:41,433
Do it.

417
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,993
Keep the gun handy.

418
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,073
Aargh!

419
00:37:26,073 --> 00:37:27,913
Ow!

420
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,513
Nice call.

421
00:37:30,553 --> 00:37:31,793
(Thanks.)

422
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:37,873
That's gotta be
the end of the curse now. Right?

423
00:37:38,913 --> 00:37:40,633
Here's hoping.

424
00:37:42,073 --> 00:37:44,073
The curse?

425
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:48,553
(I made it up.)

426
00:37:48,553 --> 00:37:51,633
Don't tell him yet.
Course not.

427
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:56,433
All right?
Oh, yeah. Brilliant !

428
00:37:58,753 --> 00:38:01,513
You know, I think Stephen
might have liked this one.

429
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:04,433
I think he might have liked
our Dr Page even better !

430
00:38:05,873 --> 00:38:09,593
I want you to set up a research
programme into magnetite.

431
00:38:09,593 --> 00:38:11,673
Its effect on anomalies,

432
00:38:11,673 --> 00:38:15,233
how electricity
can be used to...lock 'em.

433
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:16,873
Cool.

434
00:38:22,753 --> 00:38:26,113
Please tell me you got
that bad-tempered reptile

435
00:38:26,113 --> 00:38:27,873
back in his box.

436
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:32,033
Yep.
Excellent.

437
00:38:32,033 --> 00:38:33,833
James Lester.

438
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:35,593
Home Office.

439
00:38:35,593 --> 00:38:37,673
This is a government facility?

440
00:38:37,673 --> 00:38:39,953
What did you think it was?
The circus?

441
00:38:42,073 --> 00:38:44,273
You're Sarah Page.

442
00:38:44,273 --> 00:38:46,313
Dr Page.

443
00:38:46,313 --> 00:38:48,433
Yes. PhD in Egyptology...

444
00:38:48,433 --> 00:38:50,233
promising academic career,

445
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:53,273
veteran of archaeological digs
all over the Middle East.

446
00:38:53,273 --> 00:38:56,393
Now you're giving lectures
to kiddies at the museum.

447
00:38:58,073 --> 00:39:01,553
How did that happen?
Just not very good at taking orders.

448
00:39:03,753 --> 00:39:05,833
You should fit right in, then.

449
00:39:07,793 --> 00:39:09,753
I've got a file?
Everyone's got a file.

450
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:13,513
Dr Page, you can't say anything
about what you saw today.

451
00:39:13,513 --> 00:39:15,153
Do I need to repeat myself?

452
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:17,633
Or should I have you arrested
for your own protection?

453
00:39:22,433 --> 00:39:24,753
Might need that.

454
00:39:28,993 --> 00:39:31,073
Is he always that rude?

455
00:39:31,073 --> 00:39:33,953
By his standards...he was actually
being pretty nice.

456
00:39:33,953 --> 00:39:37,153
So, this is what you do here, is it?
You um...

457
00:39:37,153 --> 00:39:40,193
You deal with these anomalies
as and when they occur.

458
00:39:41,233 --> 00:39:43,353
This is what we do.

459
00:39:43,353 --> 00:39:47,353
I can't believe I saw Ammut.
Well, what the Egyptians
thought was Ammut.

460
00:39:47,353 --> 00:39:49,433
A genuine living legend.

461
00:39:51,593 --> 00:39:54,273
Legends.

462
00:39:54,273 --> 00:39:55,393
Yes!

463
00:39:57,233 --> 00:39:59,393
If...anomalies have appeared
in the past,

464
00:39:59,393 --> 00:40:01,553
and they have,

465
00:40:01,553 --> 00:40:05,313
is Pristichampsus was sunning itself
by the Nile 3,000 years ago,

466
00:40:05,313 --> 00:40:07,673
that's the stuff of legend.

467
00:40:07,673 --> 00:40:10,073
Anything that seems out of place,
out of time,

468
00:40:10,073 --> 00:40:11,633
like...
Like er...

469
00:40:11,633 --> 00:40:13,993
Like Chimera. Pegasus.

470
00:40:13,993 --> 00:40:16,233
The yeti.
The hydra. Kraken.

471
00:40:16,233 --> 00:40:18,273
I've been looking at this all wrong.

472
00:40:18,273 --> 00:40:20,393
I've been thinking two-dimensionally.

473
00:40:24,273 --> 00:40:26,833
How much do you know
about mythological beasts?

474
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:30,393
Well, erm...my thesis on it
is in the British Library.

475
00:40:31,713 --> 00:40:35,153
She stays.
Do I get a say in any of this?

476
00:40:35,153 --> 00:40:37,193
Yes. Yes, of course.
I would like you

477
00:40:37,193 --> 00:40:40,793
to join us here at
the Anomaly Research Centre.

478
00:40:40,793 --> 00:40:43,433
I want you working on the source
of all the great myths.

479
00:40:43,433 --> 00:40:45,513
Where they were first spotted,
when, by whom.

480
00:40:46,553 --> 00:40:48,073
Can you find a pattern?

481
00:40:51,393 --> 00:40:53,593
Or you can go back
to lecturing schoolkids.

482
00:40:54,633 --> 00:40:56,233
Your choice.

483
00:41:05,033 --> 00:41:07,713
OK... I'm in.

484
00:41:07,713 --> 00:41:09,833
Great news. I feel safer already.

485
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:11,953
What do we do about the Sun Cage?

486
00:41:11,953 --> 00:41:15,993
Well, the anomaly's closed. Might
not open for 3,000 years - if ever.

487
00:41:15,993 --> 00:41:18,073
Yeah. But it's still a risk.

488
00:41:18,073 --> 00:41:20,433
It can't be on public display
any more.

489
00:41:20,433 --> 00:41:22,833
Happily...

490
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:24,793
that's not our decision to make.

491
00:41:25,753 --> 00:41:28,673
The Culture Minister tells me
the exhibition's moving on.

492
00:42:17,273 --> 00:42:19,233
This'll do.

493
00:42:20,793 --> 00:42:24,113
Here. Put that somewhere safe
until I work out what it is.

494
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:37,793
Now let's get out of here.

495
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:50,473
Come on, move!

496
00:42:50,473 --> 00:42:52,793
Get out!

497
00:43:22,513 --> 00:43:24,513
It's a nice place, isn't it?

498
00:43:24,513 --> 00:43:26,433
Officer...?
Detective Constable Quinn.

499
00:43:30,033 --> 00:43:31,233
Brian.

500
00:43:36,353 --> 00:43:37,633
Get down! Now!

501
00:43:39,513 --> 00:43:40,913
Aargh!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
