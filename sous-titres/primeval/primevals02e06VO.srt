00:00:08,763 --> 00:00:11,983
We're gonna see your daddy soon,
aren't we, Jake?

2
00:00:12,466 --> 00:00:15,219
He's been on a big aeroplane
up in the sky,

3
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:16,880
but he'll be landing...

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,320
God! Any minute! Come on!

5
00:00:22,729 --> 00:00:23,973
Road works again.

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,074
What's going on, Jake?

8
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,940
We have to tell Cutter.

9
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,520
But Caroline hated Rex.

10
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,774
That's why she took him, Connor.

11
00:02:18,244 --> 00:02:21,759
And to get back at you
for dumping her, by text.

12
00:02:22,196 --> 00:02:23,680
Why isn't she giving him back?

13
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,000
Maybe she's gonna hold him hostage
until I get back together with her.

14
00:02:28,227 --> 00:02:30,000
- Really?
- Maybe not.

15
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:34,000
Don't tell Cutter yet, OK?
I'll get him back, I promise.

16
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,410
So what's this secret meeting all about?

17
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:39,737
I don't know -it's a secret, ain't it?

18
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:42,980
- Do you wanna put that down?
- He's told us to meet him here.

19
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,972
I wanted it to be somewhere
we wouldn't be overheard.

20
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,371
Advanced paranoia or what?

21
00:02:55,278 --> 00:02:57,298
A necessary precaution. Come here.

22
00:02:59,193 --> 00:03:02,193
Now, someone is working against us.

23
00:03:02,456 --> 00:03:04,880
Someone who has access to the Detector

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,280
and probably the same person
who stole the headset in the Silurian.

25
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,599
Someone?

26
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:13,480
OK, I know that we all have
our own ideas about who that might be,

27
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,560
but this time,
we have to find out for sure.

28
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,280
OK, so how are we gonna do that?

29
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,681
Mummy!

30
00:03:31,398 --> 00:03:33,086
Mummy!

31
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,015
Mummy!

32
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:36,513
Mum!

33
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,600
Mummy!

34
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:41,960
Mummy! Mummy!

35
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:44,120
It's OK, Jake.

36
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:50,599
Hey, are you OK?

37
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:52,738
I can't get out.

38
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:55,430
My legs are trapped.
My little boy -

39
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,315
- What's his name?
- Jake.

40
00:03:58,018 --> 00:03:59,480
Hi, Jake. I'm Ed.

41
00:03:59,929 --> 00:04:01,480
OK, hang in there, little guy.

42
00:04:01,794 --> 00:04:03,135
The cavalry's on the way.

43
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,080
I've got a crowbar in my car.
I'll be right back.

44
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,030
OK?

45
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,433
It's OK, Jake.
The nice man's gonna get us out of here.

46
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,413
My worst nightmare in one sentence.

47
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:21,120
A mammoth on the M25!

48
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,080
- A Colombian mammoth.
- The flavour is immaterial.

49
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,402
Colombian is a hairless species, sir.

50
00:04:26,837 --> 00:04:29,680
Look, I don't care if it shaved
its legs and got a bikini wax.

51
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,360
It's on a motorway in broad daylight.

52
00:04:32,778 --> 00:04:34,220
It's not gonna be enough.

53
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,759
- No. We're gonna need a bigger gun.
- Aye.

54
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:48,760
What are you doing here?

55
00:04:49,284 --> 00:04:50,560
I needed to see you.

56
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,787
Get down!

57
00:04:53,385 --> 00:04:56,200
I... left the gun inside.
I'll catch you up, yeah?

58
00:04:58,793 --> 00:05:01,040
- What are you playing at?
- Talk to me, Stephen.

59
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:03,718
You were right.

60
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:08,880
Cutter knows about the conspiracy.

61
00:05:10,097 --> 00:05:12,578
You come with me.
We can't wait any longer.

62
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,125
Nick can cope.

63
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:21,558
Every second you delay
makes Lester's position stronger.

64
00:05:24,955 --> 00:05:25,972
All right.

65
00:05:28,223 --> 00:05:30,201
<i>We're here. OK. Don't worry now.</i>

66
00:05:33,385 --> 00:05:36,634
Hi. I've shut down the motorway
at the next two junctions,

67
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:39,680
shut down the mobile networks
and there's a no-fly zone in place

68
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,101
and the eyewitnesses
have been debriefed.

69
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:45,210
And all that with your skirt tucked
into your tights. Well done.

70
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:48,532
I'm not gonna look. Mammoth, go.

71
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,200
Oh, you beauty.

72
00:06:15,963 --> 00:06:17,880
It's the biggest
elephant that ever lived.

73
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,015
They were still running around North
America until about 8,000 years ago.

74
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:24,283
He's a herd animal.

75
00:06:26,108 --> 00:06:27,615
Can't smell its mates.

76
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,840
<i>Please help me!</i>

77
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:32,810
Please!

78
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,680
- We've got to get her out.
- My little boy!

79
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,300
No, if we go near her,
it will make things worse.

80
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,080
The mammoth's panicking
because she's making too much noise.

81
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,525
The first thing we've got to do
is get her to shut up.

82
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,340
Get Jenny to put you
through to the Highways Agency.

83
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,360
Tell them we've got
to get an urgent message.

84
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,556
I'm on it.

85
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:02,713
No, we're gonna need more fire power.

86
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,480
Oh, jeez, where the hell is Stephen?

87
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,979
We'll need proof.

88
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,200
Files, photographs, video footage.

89
00:07:10,503 --> 00:07:13,780
A complete record
of the entire anomaly operation.

90
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,693
You know Lester will
kill you if he has to.

91
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:18,356
You'll have to tell the press
everything. Could get ugly.

92
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:19,621
That's not all.

93
00:07:20,364 --> 00:07:22,185
We have to give Cutter another chance.

94
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:23,721
What?

95
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:26,080
We're gonna tell him what we're doing,
give him the choice.

96
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,880
- You can't tell him, Stephen.
- I'm not going to.

97
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:30,254
You are.

98
00:07:31,912 --> 00:07:32,920
All right.

99
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,180
If you think Nick'll listen to reason,
you're wrong.

100
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,800
He'll listen. It's not personal.

101
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:39,626
Come on.

102
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:47,353
<i>Shut up!</i>

103
00:07:47,473 --> 00:07:48,549
Tactful.

104
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,906
It's what you said, innit?

105
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,380
I can't wait any longer.

106
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:56,958
- What are you gonna do?
- This.

107
00:07:58,743 --> 00:07:59,680
Come on.

108
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,627
- Right, can you move?
- I'm trapped. Please help Jake.

109
00:08:09,747 --> 00:08:10,801
Don't worry.

110
00:08:15,492 --> 00:08:17,833
- Mum.
- It's OK. I'll look after her.

111
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,560
- Take him.
- Mum!

112
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,680
It's OK, Jake.

113
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,039
Take him.

114
00:08:24,354 --> 00:08:25,832
Connor, help Abby!

115
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,113
Come on, Jake.

116
00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:52,180
What's going on?

117
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,680
We have to get the mammoth
back through the anomaly.

118
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,946
I have an idea.

119
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,340
Look after him, Connor. I won't be long.

120
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,677
What about Dumbo?

121
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:01,219
Distract it.

122
00:09:01,912 --> 00:09:02,918
Distract it?

123
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:07,018
Distract it.

124
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,009
- Any ideas?
- Na-uh!

125
00:09:10,386 --> 00:09:11,400
Me neither.

126
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,841
Car, car, car, car...

127
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:15,875
Yes!

128
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:41,320
Darling, I've got to get
this steering column off your legs.

129
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:43,421
Now... look at me.

130
00:09:44,091 --> 00:09:45,652
This is gonna hurt a little,

131
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:47,597
but please try and be quiet.

132
00:10:31,426 --> 00:10:32,454
Jeez!

133
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:42,933
Listen to me.
Try and keep your legs straight.

134
00:10:46,423 --> 00:10:47,680
Don't look! Don't look!

135
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,328
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

136
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,240
Look at me. It's gonna be OK.

137
00:11:02,076 --> 00:11:03,506
Come on. We're getting in.

138
00:11:08,592 --> 00:11:10,760
Keys. Gotta find some keys.

139
00:11:18,401 --> 00:11:21,639
Oh, my God. I'm sorry. Sorry.

140
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,000
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

141
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,520
Keep pressing it. It's working.

142
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:39,235
Keep pressing it, mate.

143
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,639
It's out!

144
00:11:58,808 --> 00:12:02,164
Come on. Out you get.
Come on. Stand up.

145
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,888
- Head down. You'll be OK.
- And Jake?

146
00:12:06,008 --> 00:12:08,086
- He's safe.
- What about you?

147
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:09,525
I'll be fine.

148
00:12:22,331 --> 00:12:24,680
- What's this?
- Female elephant urine.

149
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:28,580
It's gonna wanna follow the scent.
From the safari park, one junction down.

150
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,383
Yes. Brilliant.

151
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:35,003
Come on now.

152
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,880
Sniff this!

153
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:44,408
The anomaly!

154
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:57,520
Connor's in that truck.

155
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:07,433
Connor, pull up the ramp!

156
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:09,430
Which button's the ramp, mate?

157
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,352
Press 'em all!

158
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,391
Connor! Pull up the ramp!

159
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:24,678
Press every button you can see.

160
00:13:34,872 --> 00:13:36,268
We caught a mammoth.

161
00:13:39,274 --> 00:13:40,682
I think we did it, mate.

162
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,880
- High five.
- Yeah!

163
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:47,736
I've never seen an elephant like that.

164
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,295
It was a monster.

165
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,550
And there was that strange light.

166
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:57,380
What do you think it is exactly?

167
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,180
Hey, who are you?

168
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,327
Mick Harper, Evening News.
What's going on?

169
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,475
Dina, we have to talk
about what happened.

170
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:07,369
- Talk about what exactly?
- You'll need to go to hospital.

171
00:14:09,201 --> 00:14:12,352
I've seen the pictures.
That thing is too big to be an elephant.

172
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,952
Do you know what? You're right.
It's actually a mammoth.

173
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:20,086
- I could do without the wind-up.
- Then stop asking stupid questions.

174
00:14:21,337 --> 00:14:23,625
There's something strange
going on down here.

175
00:14:24,228 --> 00:14:27,290
And, one way or the other,
I'm gonna find out what it is.

176
00:14:31,281 --> 00:14:32,455
62, yeah.

177
00:14:37,114 --> 00:14:39,200
Come on, Jake.
Let's find your mum, eh?

178
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:00,878
So where the hell have you been?

179
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:03,022
- We could have been killed.
- You weren't.

180
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:04,800
Not this time.

181
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:07,973
Are you just gonna ignore me, Nick?

182
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:09,760
Is she with you?

183
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,320
- Not in the way you think.
- You've been seeing her.

184
00:15:14,006 --> 00:15:15,437
A couple of times but, look,

185
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:17,400
this is important.

186
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:20,168
You're fired.

187
00:15:21,622 --> 00:15:23,680
- She can help us.
- If you think she's here to help,

188
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,000
- then you're madder than she is.
- Just listen to me!

189
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:29,900
Are you still in love with her?

190
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:31,948
Is that why you trust her?

191
00:15:33,194 --> 00:15:35,561
Do you know what?
I don't care. Do what you want.

192
00:15:38,558 --> 00:15:40,063
I tried to warn you.

193
00:15:52,396 --> 00:15:54,342
Don't get attached.
You can't keep him.

194
00:15:54,462 --> 00:15:56,960
Did you know
their trunk was five times

195
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,996
more dextrous than an elephant's?

196
00:15:59,242 --> 00:16:01,640
Why is everyone telling me facts
about mammoths today?

197
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,500
Do I look interested?

198
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:05,800
Still, those tusks might be
worth a bit.

199
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:08,752
You wouldn't!

200
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,000
Have a word with him about
personal hygiene, would you?

201
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,160
Be careful, Lester.

202
00:16:17,774 --> 00:16:20,442
He'll attack predators
if he senses danger.

203
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,675
That's not something
you see every day.

204
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:38,520
Pity you missed him in action.

205
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:40,721
I'm sorry about that.

206
00:16:43,232 --> 00:16:44,240
What about you?

207
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,680
Do you think
what we're doing here is right,

208
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:48,720
keeping all this a secret?

209
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:49,914
Yeah.

210
00:16:51,397 --> 00:16:52,314
I do.

211
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:54,880
Look at the way
we treat animals now, Stephen.

212
00:16:55,157 --> 00:16:56,880
Every day,
a new species disappears.

213
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,189
What would people do
to createres they don't understand?

214
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:03,200
This isn't just about the creatures.
This is about our future.

215
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,950
Bottom line,

216
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:07,473
whatever Cutter decides...

217
00:17:09,102 --> 00:17:10,239
I'm with him.

218
00:17:24,195 --> 00:17:26,283
We don't have the right to decide

219
00:17:26,403 --> 00:17:28,640
what people should know.

220
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:33,121
Whatever argument you have,

221
00:17:33,241 --> 00:17:35,502
you lost any credibility
when you hooked up with her.

222
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:37,100
She predicted this.

223
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:40,466
Said that you wouldn't listen.

224
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:43,061
That you were too arrogant

225
00:17:43,181 --> 00:17:44,503
to face reality.

226
00:17:46,295 --> 00:17:47,080
Reality?

227
00:17:47,308 --> 00:17:50,319
You have no idea what
that word even means any more.

228
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:52,371
The world changed.

229
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:55,690
We can't protect anyone
until we know

230
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,200
why the anomalies appear
and what they mean.

231
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:00,360
It's always your way

232
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:01,867
or nothing.

233
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,687
That works for me.

234
00:18:05,382 --> 00:18:06,840
No wonder she turned to me.

235
00:18:23,642 --> 00:18:25,639
That's made everything simple.

236
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:28,157
Connor, come with me.

237
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,503
Is anybody looking?

238
00:18:50,787 --> 00:18:53,018
Nobody knows
what we're doing, Connor.

239
00:18:53,455 --> 00:18:55,863
They've got no reason
to be suspicious.

240
00:18:56,643 --> 00:18:57,751
So relax

241
00:18:58,318 --> 00:18:59,820
and stop feeling so guilty.

242
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,953
Sorry.

243
00:19:04,032 --> 00:19:05,600
My hands are shaking.

244
00:19:12,492 --> 00:19:14,982
- This thing with Stephen...
- Don't go there.

245
00:19:22,557 --> 00:19:24,035
{\I just }Thought it was a bit harsh.

246
00:19:24,227 --> 00:19:26,440
I mean,
he's still our friend, ain't he?

247
00:19:27,908 --> 00:19:29,755
And he's nothing to do with me.

248
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,108
At least I can tell Abby I tried.

249
00:19:35,988 --> 00:19:37,274
- {\It's }Done.
- Both parts?

250
00:19:37,394 --> 00:19:38,462
Both parts.

251
00:19:38,582 --> 00:19:42,249
No-one's gonna know about this
until it turns round and bites 'em.

252
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,880
Let's see where this trial leads.

253
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:02,423
He actually hit you.

254
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:05,160
And you find that funny?

255
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,283
Yeah. Don't you? After everything
he said about not caring any more,

256
00:20:08,403 --> 00:20:10,172
my husband is actually jealous.

257
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:12,440
And that's what's important to you?

258
00:20:16,188 --> 00:20:16,960
No.

259
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,334
No, Nick doesn't matter now.

260
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,783
You and I matter.

261
00:20:23,343 --> 00:20:24,541
Our project.

262
00:20:25,444 --> 00:20:27,688
What we are gonna achieve together.

263
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,092
He shouldn't have hurt you.

264
00:20:36,363 --> 00:20:38,566
My poor Stephen.

265
00:20:48,842 --> 00:20:50,388
I'll sign for that.

266
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,149
You never can be too careful.

267
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:28,849
I thought a dramatic setting
might be appropriate.

268
00:21:29,027 --> 00:21:31,722
Why, were you hoping
for divine intervention?

269
00:21:32,968 --> 00:21:35,841
You'd better pray
Caroline doesn't hurt Rex.

270
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:40,590
Why does Caroline know about Rex?

271
00:21:45,365 --> 00:21:47,343
The thing is, me and Caroline...

272
00:21:47,463 --> 00:21:48,649
They broke up.

273
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:49,784
Yep.

274
00:21:51,425 --> 00:21:53,400
- She's stolen him.
- Oh, for...

275
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,379
What?

276
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,891
What kind of girl

277
00:21:59,011 --> 00:22:01,200
steals your lizard

278
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,905
when you split up?

279
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,609
She doesn't actually know how...
unusual he is.

280
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:10,880
What if she gives him
to somebody who does?

281
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,600
- You're right.
- Yeah. So get him back.

282
00:22:19,556 --> 00:22:20,920
Should be any minute now.

283
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,520
Can someone tell me why we're here?

284
00:22:24,892 --> 00:22:26,960
Connor reset the anomaly detector.

285
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:30,440
A false alarm went off
exactly 15 minutes ago.

286
00:22:30,939 --> 00:22:32,320
There hasn't been an alarm.

287
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,179
That's because
it was diverted first to the person

288
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:38,160
- who's been sabotaging the detector.
- They'll be coming here,

289
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,520
right now,
expecting an anomaly.

290
00:22:41,137 --> 00:22:43,900
The next person
through the door's our traitor.

291
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:49,600
Sorry I'm late.
I had a few loose ends to tie up.

292
00:22:51,646 --> 00:22:53,384
I know what a difficult job it is to

293
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:55,560
pretend to enjoy someone's company.

294
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,216
So...

295
00:22:57,486 --> 00:22:58,351
well...

296
00:22:59,953 --> 00:23:01,854
I hope this makes up for it.

297
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:14,680
- Connor's not going to get hurt, is he?
- You mean you actually care?

298
00:23:15,486 --> 00:23:16,320
I'm not...

299
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:19,480
I'm human.

300
00:23:22,381 --> 00:23:23,487
Yes you are.

301
00:23:23,923 --> 00:23:25,559
I hear you've got a present for me.

302
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,840
Excellent.
Undistinguished,

303
00:23:34,336 --> 00:23:36,326
but he can serve his purpose.

304
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,280
What purpose is that?

305
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:41,397
Why are you so interested in these...

306
00:23:42,634 --> 00:23:43,985
these things?

307
00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:47,440
Look,

308
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:50,760
if you really want to know,
I can show you.

309
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,280
Your choice.

310
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,949
It's Jenny.

311
00:24:47,957 --> 00:24:49,000
So where is it{\, then}?

312
00:24:49,545 --> 00:24:51,720
- You!
- Where's the anomaly?

313
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,952
There isn't one.

314
00:24:53,212 --> 00:24:55,000
So why are we here?

315
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,831
That's a good question.

316
00:24:56,951 --> 00:24:58,640
I give you 10 seconds to answer it.

317
00:25:00,504 --> 00:25:02,865
I knew you were odd,
but this is extreme, even by

318
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,920
- your standards.
- The alarm was false.

319
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,840
The only way that
you could've known is if you created

320
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,640
a diversion between the detector
and your own computer.

321
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,640
- Now, who are you working for?
- I must ask you to lower your weapon!

322
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,520
- Now, what do you want?
- I don't know what you're on about.

323
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,560
All I know is I was told to bring

324
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,880
as many men as possible to this address
to deal with a high priority anomaly.

325
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,119
Who told you{\ that}?

326
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,239
I'm not{\ very good at} talking with a gun in my face,
so put it down and we'll discuss this!

327
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,919
I said: Who sent you!

328
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,800
Sir, this is your last chance.

329
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,799
You're gonna get us both killed.

330
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,663
Sir, lower your weapon!

331
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:36,440
Lower your weapon at once!

332
00:25:38,084 --> 00:25:39,520
Last chance.

333
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,462
Leek.

334
00:25:44,528 --> 00:25:46,403
It was Leek who sent me.

335
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:48,520
Leek.

336
00:25:52,156 --> 00:25:53,600
We gotta get back to the Arc.

337
00:26:38,692 --> 00:26:39,787
Hello?

338
00:28:03,212 --> 00:28:04,745
Anybody there?

339
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:24,960
<i>You are on your own, James.</i>

340
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:28,200
- <i>There's no-one there but you.</i>
- Leek, what the hell are you doing?

341
00:28:28,552 --> 00:28:31,480
<i>Now, I want you to feel what
it's like to be on the wrong end</i>

342
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,806
<i>of your grand disdain.</i>

343
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:38,400
<i>The little man looking up
at the big boss.</i>

344
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,855
Security!

345
00:28:40,101 --> 00:28:41,980
I want security in here now!

346
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,840
<i>They've all gone, James.</i>

347
00:28:45,205 --> 00:28:48,560
<i>Either off
on Cutter's wild goose chase,</i>

348
00:28:49,035 --> 00:28:49,839
<i>or dead.</i>

349
00:28:50,089 --> 00:28:51,101
<i>Now...</i>

350
00:28:53,825 --> 00:28:55,686
<i>I'm gonna hunt you.</i>

351
00:30:46,468 --> 00:30:47,590
Leek!

352
00:30:47,918 --> 00:30:50,090
You're never gonna
make me beg for my life,

353
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:52,300
so let's just end it now.

354
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
<i>All right, if you insist.</i>

355
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,240
<i>Goodbye, James.</i>

356
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,200
One more thing.

357
00:31:01,035 --> 00:31:01,800
Yes?

358
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,800
You really are a tiresome little man.

359
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,078
Come on.

360
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,366
Good boy. Good mammoth.

361
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,969
Why would Leek
go to so much trouble to kill me?

362
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:58,680
That was the icing on the cake.

363
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,891
There's something bigger
than just you going on here.

364
00:32:02,051 --> 00:32:04,151
First I'm a traitor,
now I'm insignificant.

365
00:32:04,271 --> 00:32:05,680
You're gonna hurt my feelings.

366
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,477
If Leek wanted you dead,
he could've pushed you down a lift shaft

367
00:32:08,597 --> 00:32:09,955
but he studied the anomalies.

368
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:12,120
He found how to control
the future predator.

369
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,960
Doesn't sound like just a petty grudge.

370
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,800
So what does he want?

371
00:32:17,065 --> 00:32:18,400
I don't know.

372
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,760
My kids are really
pestering me for a pet.

373
00:32:23,112 --> 00:32:25,100
If you can't find a home for it...

374
00:32:31,052 --> 00:32:32,640
You're cross with me, aren't you?

375
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,760
You held a gun to my head.

376
00:32:35,482 --> 00:32:38,084
I set a trap and you walked into it.

377
00:32:38,204 --> 00:32:39,960
I mean, what was I supposed to think?

378
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,840
You could've trusted me.

379
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,440
I had overwhelming evidence
that you were a traitor.

380
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,760
Your evidence was wrong.

381
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,040
I don't know
what you're complaining about.

382
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,800
Nobody got hurt. The plan worked.

383
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,900
In a roundabout kind of way.

384
00:33:00,993 --> 00:33:03,440
- What are you doing?
- Trying to track down Leek.

385
00:33:03,739 --> 00:33:06,100
There's got to be a clue
in his personal files.

386
00:33:06,345 --> 00:33:08,400
Obviously know your way around.

387
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,209
Hack into him regularly, do you?

388
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:14,320
Oh, yeah.

389
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,200
You'd be amazed
how much Lester gets paid.

390
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,609
- What's my middle name?
- Sarah.

391
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,480
- You told me that once though, right?
- No.

392
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,100
Keep out of my personal information,
Connor.

393
00:33:38,414 --> 00:33:39,960
Oh, look. Got it!

394
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,600
Password?

395
00:33:45,877 --> 00:33:46,680
Leek...

396
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,800
{\a6}**Access denied

397
00:33:49,417 --> 00:33:50,480
No.

398
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:52,985
Lester.

399
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,280
{\a6}**Access denied

400
00:33:55,846 --> 00:33:57,555
Predator.

401
00:34:03,856 --> 00:34:06,280
Mother's maiden name?
They always use that.

402
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,156
Murphy.

403
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,200
Anomaly.

404
00:34:15,733 --> 00:34:17,760
- It's way too obvious.
- Well, just try it.

405
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:36,600
Look. We're in.

406
00:34:38,107 --> 00:34:40,720
It's a bomb. Everybody get out now.

407
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,900
- What?
- Get out!

408
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,960
Connor, not you.

409
00:34:59,913 --> 00:35:02,540
Leek knew we'd come after him,
so he's booby trapped the file.

410
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,886
Why are we still here?

411
00:35:04,006 --> 00:35:06,293
If this bomb goes off, we lose the Arc
and everything in it,

412
00:35:06,413 --> 00:35:08,697
the detector,
our research, everything...

413
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,760
- We've got to stop it.
- OK.

414
00:35:12,284 --> 00:35:15,080
We can do this. We can do this.

415
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:21,666
Pliers.

416
00:35:28,102 --> 00:35:29,623
Which wire?

417
00:35:29,933 --> 00:35:31,880
Which wire do I cut?

418
00:35:33,689 --> 00:35:36,280
Red one, always the red one.

419
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:44,920
Count it down.

420
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,294
Fourteen.

421
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,400
- Thirteen.
- Count slower.

422
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,280
Twelve. Cutter!

423
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,240
Ten. Nine.

424
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,354
Eight.

425
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,320
Seven. Please don't leave me here.

426
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,600
Six. Five.

427
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,280
Four. Three.

428
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,361
Two.

429
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,112
One...

430
00:36:26,632 --> 00:36:29,520
He was using the battery
as a power source.

431
00:36:30,247 --> 00:36:32,782
If there's no battery in,
there's no bomb.

432
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:39,617
Never a dull moment.

433
00:36:42,603 --> 00:36:45,160
You did what? A bomb?

434
00:36:46,074 --> 00:36:49,300
Of all the crass,
misconceived ideas, Oliver...

435
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,071
Do you want me to finish this now?
Because I can walk away at any time

436
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:55,803
and without me, you're nothing.
do you understand?

437
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:59,674
You realise this is going to make Nick
more determined to find you.

438
00:37:07,615 --> 00:37:08,910
What is it?

439
00:37:09,389 --> 00:37:13,061
My guess is that
it's some kind of neural clamp.

440
00:37:14,217 --> 00:37:16,637
It was surgically implanted
in the skull of the predator.

441
00:37:16,797 --> 00:37:19,100
It must be how Leek was controlling it.

442
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:24,439
The clamp is linked
to the central nervous system

443
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,120
and it's operated
by remote radio signals.

444
00:37:27,801 --> 00:37:30,920
- Never seen anything this advanced.
- Leek isn't this smart.

445
00:37:31,391 --> 00:37:34,000
You mean he hotwired his brain
by remote control.

446
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,480
Which is where he's made a mistake.

447
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,254
Any incoming radio signals are picked up
by the Detector, right?

448
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:44,540
Yeah.

449
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,660
So all we have to do is track
where this signal is transmitted from

450
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,482
and that's where we'll find Leek.

451
00:37:50,642 --> 00:37:52,200
I'm on it.

452
00:37:54,501 --> 00:37:56,599
Should we call Stephen?

453
00:37:57,934 --> 00:38:00,000
Stephen's made his bed.
Let him lie in it now.

454
00:38:00,807 --> 00:38:02,880
You make
a crude little joke like that again,

455
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:05,190
you'll regret it.

456
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,835
Who was that?

457
00:38:14,051 --> 00:38:17,200
A journalist. Someone from the old days.
I've arranged a meeting.

458
00:38:17,584 --> 00:38:18,720
I come with you.

459
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,500
Not this time. He's an old friend.
I'll be better on my own.

460
00:38:22,297 --> 00:38:24,551
Won't he be surprised to hear from you?

461
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,960
You're supposed to be dead.

462
00:38:28,092 --> 00:38:32,031
Exactly, which is why it'd be easier
if I see him on my own. It's...

463
00:38:33,097 --> 00:38:34,749
There's a lot of explaining to do.

464
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:36,818
If you get everything ready,
I'll be back soon.

465
00:38:36,938 --> 00:38:38,046
Will do.

466
00:38:39,841 --> 00:38:40,939
OK.

467
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:46,264
I put a visual trace on the signal Leek
was transmitting to the future predator.

468
00:38:46,384 --> 00:38:48,640
That's it?
There's no chance of making a mistake?

469
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,373
I don't do mistakes...

470
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:54,316
... often. Not in this case.
That's definitely the location.

471
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,600
- Come on, then.
- Where do you think you're going?

472
00:38:58,256 --> 00:38:59,640
Well, where do you think?

473
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,802
This operation's
no place for a civilian.

474
00:39:01,962 --> 00:39:03,464
The military will handle it.

475
00:39:03,624 --> 00:39:04,880
Under my supervision.

476
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,960
Look on the bright side.

477
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:39,740
At least you're safe here.

478
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,401
I'm supposed to be out there
doing something.

479
00:39:42,561 --> 00:39:43,720
I can trace her.

480
00:39:44,432 --> 00:39:46,385
- What? Who?
- Caroline.

481
00:39:47,521 --> 00:39:49,680
You wanted me to get Rex back?

482
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:53,140
I could trace Caroline's mobile
through the Detector.

483
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,500
Connor, that's an illegal use
of government property!

484
00:39:57,467 --> 00:39:58,760
I'm not looking.

485
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,960
- Is that her?
- Yeah.

486
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,000
Well, that's where her phone is, anyway.

487
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:08,100
Come on. She'd better still have him.

488
00:40:09,049 --> 00:40:11,660
We've found her!
We're gonna go get Rex back.

489
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,240
I'll come with you!

490
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,380
They'll probably
only lose him again anyway.

491
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,040
You can't. Lester said -

492
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,009
Lester said we couldn't go with him.

493
00:40:19,129 --> 00:40:21,200
He didn't say that we had to stay here.

494
00:40:24,587 --> 00:40:26,300
What the hell?

495
00:40:32,896 --> 00:40:34,000
This is it.

496
00:40:48,258 --> 00:40:49,901
Are you sure about this?

497
00:40:50,662 --> 00:40:53,253
It doesn't look the kind of place
Caroline would hang out in.

498
00:40:54,831 --> 00:40:56,900
Maybe it's some kind of retreat.

499
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,825
She was always very... spiritual.

500
00:41:00,116 --> 00:41:02,238
Or maybe you just messed up.

501
00:41:04,908 --> 00:41:07,575
No, this is the place.

502
00:41:15,293 --> 00:41:18,000
OK, gents, body cameras on.

503
00:41:18,891 --> 00:41:20,400
Team, forward.

504
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,282
They're here.

505
00:42:04,836 --> 00:42:06,160
This is Caroline's bag.

506
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,200
<i>Approaching the door now, sir.</i>

507
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,880
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

508
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,500
<i>Entry team, standby. This is the door.</i>

509
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:20,200
Wait!

510
00:42:21,895 --> 00:42:23,440
<i>They're behind this door.</i>

511
00:42:31,501 --> 00:42:33,707
I wondered who was gonna come.

512
00:42:33,867 --> 00:42:36,200
And I was hoping it was gonna be you.

513
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,373
**Bad Luck

514
00:42:55,235 --> 00:42:57,700
It's almost like they knew
we were coming, sir.

515
00:43:06,596 --> 00:43:07,751
Nick?

516
00:43:08,389 --> 00:43:10,200
Nick, are you all right?

517
00:43:11,517 --> 00:43:12,822
Nick?

518
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:16,832
Nick.

519
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,101
Are you OK?

520
00:43:35,464 --> 00:43:37,370
I'm sorry.

521
00:43:37,821 --> 00:43:40,000
I told them not to hurt you.

522
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:44,600
What are you doing here?

523
00:43:53,511 --> 00:43:55,098
Helen!

524
00:43:56,347 --> 00:43:58,234
You're behind this!

525
00:43:58,394 --> 00:44:00,800
Helen has been very helpful.

526
00:44:01,057 --> 00:44:04,880
But please,
give a little credit where it's due.

527
00:44:09,148 --> 00:44:10,960
What's going on?

528
00:44:58,526 --> 00:45:01,680
All those creatures! Why are they here?

529
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,680
What are they gonna do with them?

530
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,360
I intend to be very, very powerful.

531
00:45:08,785 --> 00:45:12,120
People are dying and many more will die
unless you do something.

532
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,280
I've had enough of this.

533
00:45:15,502 --> 00:45:17,920
There's a whole army of predators
out there.

534
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,520
They're too powerful.

535
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,759
There's nothing you can do!

536
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:24,080
Then we're all gonna die!

537
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,000
Stephen, open the door!

538
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,400
Stephen!
