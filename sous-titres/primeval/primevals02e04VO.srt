1
00:00:33,422 --> 00:00:35,589
Lucien, you fumbled the ball, man.
Go get.

2
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:36,902
Yeah, yeah. Right.

3
00:00:45,595 --> 00:00:46,806
Aw, man!

4
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,260
Help!

5
00:01:17,063 --> 00:01:18,240
Someone help!

6
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,400
What's that idiot doing?

7
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,188
Help! Help! Someone!

Transcript: evarin - Sync: MNk & Golgi

9
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:15,003
- OK, where is it?
- Identifying location now.

10
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,320
- In the river?
- Trying to confirm coordinates.

11
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:35,899
- What's happened?
- The anomaly must have closed.

12
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:38,698
- Well, did you get the location?
- We didn't have enough time.

13
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:40,102
Give me the coordinates!

14
00:03:03,622 --> 00:03:06,120
- Do you want something, Caroline?
- Nothing.

15
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,280
I notice you do a lot of scissor kicks.

16
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:12,640
They won't to be enough
to disable your opponent.

17
00:03:14,577 --> 00:03:17,200
Really you should be looking
to catch them, excuse me,

18
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,650
really you should be looking
to catch them in the throat area.

19
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,720
Like...

20
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:25,160
that.

21
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:30,200
Your way he gets a few bruises,
but mine, he's totally on the floor.

22
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,440
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,560
Good.

24
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:38,640
Dinner is served.

25
00:03:39,974 --> 00:03:40,760
That's...

26
00:03:42,427 --> 00:03:43,160
Amazing!

27
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:46,400
- Is that all for me?
- Yeah, you and...

28
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:52,720
Where to start?

29
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,400
It's Cutter. He's been calling.

30
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,410
- No. I've had no call.
- It must have.

31
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,618
I think I'd know if
Cutter was calling me.

32
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,599
We've got to go.

33
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,480
I could have sworn this was switched on.

34
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,960
What's so important
you have to leave everything?

35
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,036
Turn the lights out when you leave.

36
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:17,040
I'd like to...

37
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,574
Sorry, Caroline.

38
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:31,548
They just left.

39
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:34,929
<i>- You were supposed to delay them.</i>
- I put them off as long as I could.

40
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:52,611
The boy's name is Lucien Hope.

41
00:04:52,731 --> 00:04:54,990
His friends said he seemed
to be struggling with something.

42
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,684
- Did they see anything?
- No.

43
00:04:56,804 --> 00:05:00,384
- Maybe he just lost his footing.
- No, the lid's been lifted clean off.

44
00:05:00,504 --> 00:05:01,815
Water pressure?

45
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:03,275
Could be.

46
00:05:03,395 --> 00:05:05,501
Rainfall's been below
average for the month,

47
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:07,512
and floods don't happen for no reason,

48
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:09,734
which means the anomaly's under water.

49
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:13,530
- Where does this drain go?
- Back to the canal.

50
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,440
Seal it off and tell Abby and
Connor to meet us at the other end.

51
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:22,989
- Do you think he's still alive?
- I don't know.

52
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,480
But I ain't giving up on him
until I know for sure.

53
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,937
What the hell is that?

54
00:05:57,155 --> 00:05:58,221
Lucien?

55
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,520
Stephen, it's not human.

56
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,541
Lucien!

57
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:12,760
Stephen!

58
00:06:19,265 --> 00:06:21,542
It can only get out into the canal.

59
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:37,712
I'll have to say something to Caroline,
you know.

60
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:39,723
It's weird, us rushing off all the time.

61
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:41,230
Here's what you can tell her.

62
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,150
<i>"Stop coming to my flat
every five minutes."</i>

63
00:06:43,544 --> 00:06:44,799
Our flat.

64
00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:47,529
All right, your flat.

65
00:06:49,705 --> 00:06:53,033
- Why is she at mine so much, anyway?
- Don't be naive, Abby.

66
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:55,320
You're looking at the reason,
aren't you?

67
00:06:57,194 --> 00:07:00,307
- Not much going on there, is there?
- We're taking it slow.

68
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:03,329
She is.

69
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:07,391
You know what, you don't know
what you're talking about.

70
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:11,120
Why don't you stay out of it?
I don't care what you think. All right?

71
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,679
Is there any way out of this canal?

72
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:16,680
The locks are closed.
It's completely sealed.

73
00:07:16,841 --> 00:07:18,643
- Then it's still in here.
- What is?

74
00:07:18,763 --> 00:07:20,526
I'm not sure,
but we have to find out fast.

75
00:07:20,646 --> 00:07:22,030
It'll be dark in a few hours.

76
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,400
Go in the boat with Abby and Connor.
You see anything, call us.

77
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:27,022
Let's go.

78
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:43,560
We've searched for hours.
We'll never see anything in this light.

79
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,166
What's that over there?

80
00:07:45,286 --> 00:07:46,760
- There?
- Where?

81
00:07:48,414 --> 00:07:50,545
Can you get us a bit closer here?

82
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,998
Looks like skin.

83
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:06,485
Yeah, from a mammal.

84
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:11,600
Looks like whatever it
is just shrugged it off.

85
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,000
- Back up. I saw something.
- Where?

86
00:08:19,904 --> 00:08:21,360
That way, port, about 20 metres.

87
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:26,480
- I said port!
- This is port!

88
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:29,000
Starboard, then!
Just go, before it disappears!

89
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,280
How can he steer if
you don't know which is which?

90
00:08:35,204 --> 00:08:37,280
- I've lost it now!
- Oh, great.

91
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:39,640
- Give me a go.
- What can you see that I can't?

92
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,884
Maybe you've...

93
00:08:41,004 --> 00:08:44,099
For heaven's sake, you two argue
like a couple of kids over a toy!

94
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,080
Look, out of the way. I'll do it.

95
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:01,319
What just happened?

96
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,211
I don't know.
We must have hit something.

97
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,840
Come on, we'll get you out.
That's it, Jenny - swim.

98
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,966
What the hell is that?

99
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:16,798
You have to get out of the water.

100
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,306
Quickly!

101
00:09:23,676 --> 00:09:25,680
Come on, Jenny! You'll be OK! Swim!

102
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:27,245
I can't swim!

103
00:09:30,917 --> 00:09:32,829
<i>Come on! Swim, Jenny!</i>

104
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:34,920
<i>Move your feet! Swim!</i>

105
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,359
Hurry up, darling!
Come on! You're going to be fine.

106
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,640
Help me!

107
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:41,840
Swim quicker. Swim quicker!

108
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,600
Come on!
You can do it! Keep swimming!

109
00:09:46,241 --> 00:09:48,760
- Come on, you're nearly there!
- Swim!

110
00:09:52,394 --> 00:09:53,766
Jenny, here. Quickly.

111
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,440
- Stop, Stephen!
- Better late than never.

112
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,324
Get the body back to the yard, ASAP.

113
00:10:08,444 --> 00:10:09,680
<i>Roger that.</i>

114
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,498
What was that thing?

115
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,080
How are you doing?

116
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:50,131
Three months ago,
my idea of a life-and-death issue

117
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:52,960
was getting front-row seats
at London Fashion Week.

118
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,920
- How d'you think I'm doing?
- You don't have to do this.

119
00:10:58,897 --> 00:11:00,270
You know, you can quit.

120
00:11:01,116 --> 00:11:03,102
I think I'll take my chances.

121
00:11:04,912 --> 00:11:06,372
Look, Claudia...

122
00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:07,680
So sorry.

123
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:09,400
- Jenny.
- You know what?

124
00:11:09,561 --> 00:11:11,062
You saved my life.

125
00:11:11,182 --> 00:11:14,360
So just for tonight,
you can call me anything you like.

126
00:11:14,863 --> 00:11:18,120
For the record, I really hate that name.

127
00:11:22,871 --> 00:11:25,120
Does your fiance know what you're doing?

128
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:28,400
He knows I'm working for the government,
that's all.

129
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:30,970
Luckily he's not very...

130
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,364
curious.

131
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,693
Not about my work, anyway.

132
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,320
So what about you?
Do you have... someone?

133
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:44,668
No.

134
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,560
I'm not particularly good at that.

135
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:50,865
My wife left eight-and-a-half years ago
to travel through the anomaly,

136
00:11:50,985 --> 00:11:53,332
and the next woman that I liked, she...

137
00:11:56,377 --> 00:11:57,560
She left.

138
00:11:58,169 --> 00:12:01,680
I don't seem to be a particularly
romantic proposition at the moment.

139
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,680
And on that note, if you'll excuse me,
I have a date with a dead shark.

140
00:12:23,026 --> 00:12:24,720
Do you think this is what took Lucien?

141
00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:27,360
What a terrible way to die.

142
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:28,829
Poor kid.

143
00:12:29,953 --> 00:12:31,529
But we have to know for sure.

144
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,527
Wait a minute.

145
00:12:45,673 --> 00:12:46,680
God.

146
00:12:49,238 --> 00:12:51,840
- Muscle spasm.
- It's some kind of proboscis.

147
00:12:54,347 --> 00:12:56,596
It's a tongue covered in teeth.

148
00:12:56,716 --> 00:13:00,080
Probably used to grab his victims
and then pull them into his mouth.

149
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:04,040
Unless I've missed my guess, this is
the future evolution of the shark.

150
00:13:12,035 --> 00:13:15,120
Let's get this done.
We're going to have to cut it open.

151
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,967
Wow, that's strong.

152
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,640
God.

153
00:14:04,492 --> 00:14:06,200
There's nothing else
left in its stomach.

154
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,346
It's not him.
He can't have been digested by now.

155
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:11,070
Exactly.
A shark takes days to digest prey.

156
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,134
Lucien went missing hours ago.

157
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,000
Not guilty?

158
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,572
So it was another one?

159
00:14:18,936 --> 00:14:19,840
Maybe.

160
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:25,000
- Give me some good news.
- We still haven't found the boy.

161
00:14:25,161 --> 00:14:27,981
No, that's bad news.
Good news makes people happy.

162
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:29,255
Keep trying.

163
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:31,800
We found the shark.

164
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:33,763
Now you're getting the hang of it.

165
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:34,989
So then!

166
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,120
- Problem solved?
- No, not quite.

167
00:14:37,281 --> 00:14:39,384
There's another predator.
Abby saw something.

168
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,160
- Another shark.
- Or something else.

169
00:14:41,723 --> 00:14:44,185
All the evidence points to
a marine mammal that sheds its skin,

170
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:45,560
like a seal or a walrus.

171
00:14:45,721 --> 00:14:47,726
And the boy was taken above ground,

172
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:51,280
so even if the shark swam up
the flooded drain, how did it grab him?

173
00:14:51,441 --> 00:14:53,740
- Using that proboscis.
- That wouldn't explain the singing.

174
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,897
A shark can't make that sound.
It doesn't have vocal chords.

175
00:14:57,017 --> 00:14:58,895
So to sum up,
we're looking for a deadly,

176
00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:02,280
skin-shedding aquatic predator with
a line in Charlotte Church impressions.

177
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,731
Well, the marketing
possibilities are endless.

178
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:09,760
- What do we do?
- Drag the canal.

179
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:12,200
- Whatever it is has to be in there.
- If it's a mammal,

180
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:14,897
it can leave the water,
so we should widen the search.

181
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:19,477
Start the search of the
canal again in the morning.

182
00:15:19,597 --> 00:15:21,517
If nothing turns up, then,

183
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:24,480
and only then,
we'll consider the options.

184
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:31,297
Good decision, sir.

185
00:15:32,696 --> 00:15:34,280
Exactly what I was going to suggest.

186
00:15:35,182 --> 00:15:36,367
Really?

187
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,960
How terribly reassuring.

188
00:15:50,892 --> 00:15:51,746
Come here.

189
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:53,773
What's she doing?

190
00:15:54,104 --> 00:15:55,404
She stayed up for me!

191
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,920
She didn't stay up, did she?
She's asleep.

192
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,550
It's the thought that counts.

193
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:09,992
<i>What are you doing?
You should have gone home to bed.</i>

194
00:16:10,112 --> 00:16:11,040
Rex?

195
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:26,758
Could you just...

196
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,480
- What were you doing in there?
- Oh my God!

197
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,320
- Oh my God!
- How did this happen?

198
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,640
I have no idea.

199
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,812
- Maybe...
- I'll get some towels. I'll get towels.

200
00:16:36,932 --> 00:16:39,480
Maybe he crawled in when
I was putting things away.

201
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,456
- I'll call a vet.
- No!

202
00:16:41,724 --> 00:16:43,200
- Get me some tinfoil.
- Tinfoil.

203
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,360
- Right.
- I should go.

204
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:47,480
- Yeah, good idea.
- Abby!

205
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,002
I'm sorry.

206
00:16:52,448 --> 00:16:53,520
I hope he makes it.

207
00:16:58,358 --> 00:16:59,875
Look, you don't need to go.

208
00:17:04,313 --> 00:17:05,439
He's going to be OK?

209
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,640
Don't touch him!
You don't know what you're doing.

210
00:17:07,801 --> 00:17:10,239
Keep your girlfriend away
from him in future, yeah?

211
00:17:12,914 --> 00:17:13,800
Sorry.

212
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:29,555
Look,
something about this doesn't add up.

213
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:31,840
We should widen the
search to the canalside.

214
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:33,720
This is another of your hunches?

215
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,960
We can't just drop everything, you know.

216
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,960
- There's a plan in place. A good one.
- When have I ever been wrong?

217
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,120
Except about women, generally.

218
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,560
Look at the odds,
it's got to be in the canal.

219
00:17:45,721 --> 00:17:47,880
Just give me a few
minutes to look over there.

220
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,056
- What am I meant to tell Lester?
- Cover for me.

221
00:17:50,176 --> 00:17:52,000
No, cos you're wasting time.

222
00:17:53,262 --> 00:17:54,286
Ten minutes.

223
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,120
So what's going on?

224
00:19:05,591 --> 00:19:06,661
I know you.

225
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,866
You know that guy that hit you?

226
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:05,440
- What if he comes back?
- He won't.

227
00:20:05,601 --> 00:20:06,817
I've seen him before,

228
00:20:07,994 --> 00:20:10,275
in the mall. He was the cleaner.

229
00:20:10,395 --> 00:20:11,729
I've seen that guy too.

230
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:14,099
I saw him at the ARC.

231
00:20:14,219 --> 00:20:16,520
- He was dressed like a soldier.
- Are you sure?

232
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,400
Something's going on.
We're being watched.

233
00:20:23,338 --> 00:20:24,360
Maybe.

234
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,320
We should get Stephen, yeah?

235
00:20:32,478 --> 00:20:34,026
Are you recording this?

236
00:20:36,157 --> 00:20:38,520
- What does it sound like to you?
- Dunno.

237
00:20:39,814 --> 00:20:42,640
A bit like something I once heard
in Glastonbury, in a chill-out tent.

238
00:20:42,801 --> 00:20:44,360
- Glastonbury?
- Yeah.

239
00:20:44,521 --> 00:20:46,720
- Like you've been there.
- How would you know?

240
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:48,600
What's going on with the pair of you?

241
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:50,400
Connor's dating Cruella de Vil.

242
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:52,338
For crying out loud.
It wasn't an accident.

243
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,888
How many times do I have to...

244
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:02,920
Right, grab the recordings
and let's get back in the boat.

245
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,480
OK, here'll do.
Play back the recording.

246
00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:12,200
See if we can't invite
them to come and see us.

247
00:21:36,065 --> 00:21:37,233
Guys?

248
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:42,680
Nothing...

249
00:21:50,903 --> 00:21:52,520
Maybe no one's home.

250
00:21:57,828 --> 00:21:58,992
I think this is silly.

251
00:21:59,112 --> 00:22:01,667
We should be helping
Stephen search the canal.

252
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,098
It's not in the canal.

253
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,200
Something's taken her!

254
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,049
Put that down! You could kill Abby!

255
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,502
I can't see her!

256
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:24,179
Get help! Now!

257
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,760
- Now!
- OK, OK!

258
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,926
No. What are we doing?

259
00:22:54,046 --> 00:22:56,799
We have to keep looking!
We can't, we can't just stop!

260
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,196
This is Abby!
We can't just give up!

261
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,371
I'm not stopping looking!

262
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:07,680
Connor, we're doing all we can.

263
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,880
We told you and you didn't come!

264
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:14,000
Why? Why didn't you help?

265
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,434
- How did this happen?
- I was following up a lead.

266
00:23:17,554 --> 00:23:18,996
And who did you tell about it?

267
00:23:20,613 --> 00:23:21,854
Did you know about this?

268
00:23:22,102 --> 00:23:22,880
No.

269
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,040
- And now the girl's dead.
- Not dead! She's not dead!

270
00:23:26,763 --> 00:23:28,631
We could just go out there,
we could find her!

271
00:23:28,751 --> 00:23:30,952
We need to get back in
the boat and do something!

272
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,440
Why is nobody doing anything?

273
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:37,000
- Take him home.
- Please! Don't do this!

274
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,784
I suppose teamwork,
for once in your life,

275
00:23:44,904 --> 00:23:47,480
- was completely beyond you?
- I take responsibility for this.

276
00:23:47,641 --> 00:23:49,720
- How very gracious of you.
- It's still out there.

277
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,720
We are very close,
and we still have to finish the job.

278
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:55,017
It's finished, for you.

279
00:23:55,137 --> 00:23:56,160
Go home.

280
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,601
You're in charge.

281
00:24:01,195 --> 00:24:04,000
Don't look at him. Look at me!
Come on! What do you want?

282
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,356
Something better than sonar.

283
00:24:07,476 --> 00:24:09,560
We have to go over
every inch of canal again.

284
00:24:09,721 --> 00:24:12,040
- A remote control submarine can do it.
- Get it for him.

285
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,800
You're looking in the wrong place.

286
00:24:15,932 --> 00:24:17,560
- Do you agree?
- No.

287
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:24,491
Whatever took Abby is in the canal.

288
00:24:30,443 --> 00:24:32,297
Straight down and we go straight for it.

289
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:34,880
- How deep is it here?
- About ten metres, sir.

290
00:25:33,845 --> 00:25:34,873
Help!

291
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,874
He-e-e-elp!

292
00:25:44,187 --> 00:25:46,143
- Help!
- Lucien.

293
00:25:46,263 --> 00:25:48,713
- I thought you were dead!
- What is this place?

294
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:51,866
I don't know.

295
00:25:51,986 --> 00:25:54,640
They took us down here, those things.

296
00:25:58,047 --> 00:25:59,200
Don't waste your time.

297
00:26:00,057 --> 00:26:01,960
- I already tried that.
- We have to try.

298
00:26:02,374 --> 00:26:04,360
Come on, help me.

299
00:26:13,463 --> 00:26:15,433
We're going to die, aren't we?

300
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:17,553
My friends are looking for us.

301
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,166
- They're going to be here soon.
- They don't even know we're alive.

302
00:26:22,808 --> 00:26:25,855
They'll find us. I promise.

303
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:38,387
You're not supposed to be here.

304
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:42,640
- Where else am I going to go?
- I could have you thrown out.

305
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,008
Yup. You could.

306
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,734
Thought you might be interested in this.

307
00:26:49,354 --> 00:26:51,234
A local builder lodged a complaint.

308
00:26:51,354 --> 00:26:53,240
He can't get in to demolish
an old warehouse,

309
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:55,668
because the basement
flooded in the tidal surge.

310
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:58,360
Maybe you're right,

311
00:26:58,521 --> 00:27:00,800
and we're looking in the wrong place.

312
00:27:01,573 --> 00:27:04,120
At the very least,
it's definitely worth checking out.

313
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,975
As petty-minded bureaucrats go,

314
00:27:11,267 --> 00:27:12,520
you're the best.

315
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,832
I know how you feel.

316
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:46,040
But I need your help.
I think I know where to look.

317
00:27:52,717 --> 00:27:53,720
<i>Listen to me.</i>

318
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:55,063
It was my fault.

319
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,333
I should have asked for backup,
and I didn't.

320
00:28:00,328 --> 00:28:02,664
I reckon that's cost
the life of a very brave,

321
00:28:02,784 --> 00:28:04,314
very beautiful girl.

322
00:28:05,569 --> 00:28:06,679
And you're...

323
00:28:07,715 --> 00:28:09,161
you're right to blame me.

324
00:28:12,207 --> 00:28:14,762
But surely,
if there's even half a chance

325
00:28:14,882 --> 00:28:18,820
we can stop this happening to somebody
else, then we owe it to Abby to do it.

326
00:28:22,927 --> 00:28:25,336
And this time,
I'm asking for backup, so...

327
00:28:25,456 --> 00:28:27,409
will you come and help? Please?

328
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,089
If you change your mind,
Jenny Lewis knows where to find me.

329
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,040
Help!

330
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,154
What do you think they are,
those things?

331
00:29:04,274 --> 00:29:05,400
I don't know.

332
00:29:05,561 --> 00:29:07,628
 If they were going to kill us,
they would have.

333
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:10,081
There's a reason we're still alive.

334
00:29:11,263 --> 00:29:13,087
Don't tell my mates, will you?

335
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,200
That I was scared.

336
00:29:17,232 --> 00:29:18,280
You're not scared.

337
00:29:19,876 --> 00:29:21,080
Seriously now.

338
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:24,255
Who'd be frightened
of an overgrown tadpole?

339
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:28,299
You're fine. Honestly.

340
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,061
We've swept the whole canal.

341
00:29:39,981 --> 00:29:41,080
Sweep it again.

342
00:29:44,396 --> 00:29:45,400
Back it up!

343
00:29:47,491 --> 00:29:50,108
- There! Try down there.
- The opening's too small.

344
00:29:50,228 --> 00:29:52,200
- We'd smash the sub.
- I'll buy you a new one. 

345
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:53,520
Just keep going.

346
00:30:20,913 --> 00:30:22,193
Would this help?

347
00:30:25,454 --> 00:30:26,457
Yeah.

348
00:30:28,588 --> 00:30:30,515
Yeah, that'll do the trick.

349
00:30:35,325 --> 00:30:36,640
Thanks for coming.

350
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:40,777
Well, with respect,
I'm not doing it for you.

351
00:30:41,857 --> 00:30:43,882
It's what she would have wanted.

352
00:30:46,164 --> 00:30:47,440
We had an argument.

353
00:30:48,885 --> 00:30:51,604
The last things we said to each other
were mean and...

354
00:30:52,145 --> 00:30:53,211
stupid.

355
00:30:56,395 --> 00:30:58,772
She knew how much you cared about her.

356
00:31:01,463 --> 00:31:03,560
- You think?
- Yeah. I know.

357
00:31:06,715 --> 00:31:07,682
Yeah...

358
00:31:15,827 --> 00:31:16,790
You right?

359
00:31:20,308 --> 00:31:21,345
Yeah.

360
00:31:35,689 --> 00:31:37,240
The anomaly... it's reopened.

361
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,920
- You'll crash it!
- Sue me.

362
00:31:41,868 --> 00:31:44,524
- Cutter, the anomaly's reopened.
- I know.

363
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,989
This way.

364
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,400
The water!

365
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,949
It's getting deeper.

366
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,640
- Help!
- Help!

367
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,080
Someone!

368
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,480
Help!

369
00:32:04,848 --> 00:32:06,451
What are we supposed to do now?

370
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:09,947
It's just a wall.

371
00:32:12,092 --> 00:32:13,720
Help me!

372
00:32:22,891 --> 00:32:25,520
<i>I can hear shouting.
Somebody's in there!</i>

373
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,690
It's okay.
They're going to get us out.

374
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,680
You'll see. We're not gonna drown!

375
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,667
It's okay.

376
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,480
Help!

377
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,315
Hello? In here!

378
00:33:00,827 --> 00:33:02,426
Quickly! The water's rising!

379
00:33:02,546 --> 00:33:03,617
Help!

380
00:33:04,211 --> 00:33:06,440
Lucien, hang on...
we're going to get you out of there.

381
00:33:11,095 --> 00:33:12,310
You all right?

382
00:33:13,917 --> 00:33:15,561
You've got to help Abby.

383
00:33:15,738 --> 00:33:16,760
- What?
- Abby!

384
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:19,964
Abby's still alive?

385
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,800
- They took her.
- Where did they take her?

386
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,349
- Down the pipe.
- The pipes down here?

387
00:33:25,469 --> 00:33:26,956
They took her down.

388
00:33:47,764 --> 00:33:49,400
Lucien, what did it look like?

389
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,354
That!

390
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,332
I ain't going back in those tanks again.

391
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,720
What the hell is that?

392
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,320
Lucien, stay where you are.

393
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,200
Yess! Two points.

394
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,240
Who says I can't play?

395
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,440
Nice shot.

396
00:34:27,075 --> 00:34:28,224
What was that?

397
00:34:54,147 --> 00:34:55,173
What the...

398
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,960
Give me your gun.

399
00:35:00,703 --> 00:35:02,720
Give me your pistol. Come on!

400
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,480
It's OK! You're safe now!

401
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,603
No, Connor!

402
00:35:41,588 --> 00:35:43,043
No!

403
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,940
I'm coming!

404
00:36:32,176 --> 00:36:33,600
Stay there, Lucien.

405
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,860
Stay there.

406
00:36:45,465 --> 00:36:46,880
Get down. Get down!

407
00:37:44,418 --> 00:37:46,240
Abby! Come here, grab my hand!

408
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,160
Come on!
Just climb up. You can do this.

409
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,946
That's it. I've got you.

410
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,215
Grab hold of this.

411
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,449
That's it. You're nearly there.
You're so nearly there.

412
00:38:04,569 --> 00:38:06,840
Connor, I'm slipping!

413
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,424
OK... you need to come up now.

414
00:38:18,544 --> 00:38:19,388
I can't!

415
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,440
I'm pulling you over, Connor.

416
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,600
- Just leave me.
- No. I'm not letting you go.

417
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,960
I lost you once, Abby.
I'm not losing you again.

418
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,158
Now, come on. We can do this.

419
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,560
It's pointless we both die.

420
00:38:37,076 --> 00:38:38,640
Just let me go.

421
00:38:39,892 --> 00:38:40,920
Let me go.

422
00:38:43,595 --> 00:38:44,360
I can't.

423
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:45,840
Please!

424
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,743
I love you.

425
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,120
I'm not...
I'm not leaving you here.

426
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,189
No!

427
00:39:05,253 --> 00:39:06,407
Time to go.

428
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:45,262
- Right. Get these two, take 'em out.
- Sir.

429
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,760
I'm just gonna run a few more tests.
Then we'll get you back to your parents.

430
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,120
They've already been informed
that you're safe.

431
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,000
Your mates! They came! No bother!

432
00:40:12,097 --> 00:40:13,720
I reckon your boyfriend did a good job.

433
00:40:15,612 --> 00:40:17,086
He's not my boyfriend.

434
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,621
- Has the anomaly closed?
- No.

435
00:40:25,741 --> 00:40:27,983
It's still there, and likely to recur.

436
00:40:28,103 --> 00:40:29,214
You know what, Leek?

437
00:40:29,334 --> 00:40:32,080
The area could benefit from
a government redevelopment grant.

438
00:40:32,543 --> 00:40:34,160
We'll start by sealing the anomaly site

439
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,909
with a few thousand tons of concrete.
That should do the job.

440
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:39,080
- Shall I see the contractors?
- No.

441
00:40:39,241 --> 00:40:41,040
I'll get a shovel
and a cement mixer myself.

442
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,378
- Of course see the contractors, idiot.
- Yes.

443
00:40:46,117 --> 00:40:47,240
Next time I sack you,

444
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,520
you might at least pretend to stay
sacked for more than five minutes.

445
00:40:51,503 --> 00:40:54,200
Still, it's just as well you decided
to disobey my orders.

446
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,288
If it'd been left to Stephen, we'd
still be looking in the wrong place.

447
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,880
Jenny, would you like to join us?

448
00:41:08,209 --> 00:41:09,248
That's unfair.

449
00:41:10,949 --> 00:41:11,678
No.

450
00:41:12,086 --> 00:41:13,632
No, I called it wrong.

451
00:41:14,445 --> 00:41:16,200
- I was lucky.
- Yeah...

452
00:41:18,187 --> 00:41:19,138
You were.

453
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,421
- So is that it?
- What?

454
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:25,440
Is that what our future looks like?

455
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,360
No. Not ours.

456
00:41:28,032 --> 00:41:31,400
The earth, humanity,
is going to be long gone by then.

457
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,640
Or, perhaps, we do survive,

458
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,880
and just evolve back
into the world we came from.

459
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,520
You mean those things could be
our descendants?

460
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,788
It's possible.

461
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,840
Don't fancy yours much.

462
00:42:11,722 --> 00:42:13,640
Maybe you should have a lie-down.

463
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,998
Yeah...

464
00:42:18,968 --> 00:42:21,465
Back there,
on the other side of the anomaly,

465
00:42:22,912 --> 00:42:24,080
you said something.

466
00:42:27,257 --> 00:42:28,639
Yeah...

467
00:42:29,452 --> 00:42:30,960
I said a lot of things, didn't I?

468
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,760
Mainly "aaargh!"

469
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:35,669
Maybe I didn't hear you right.

470
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,615
I thought you said something

471
00:42:39,735 --> 00:42:41,168
about how...

472
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:43,120
you felt about me.

473
00:42:46,214 --> 00:42:47,234
Did I?

474
00:43:03,297 --> 00:43:04,240
Abby, I...

475
00:43:10,342 --> 00:43:11,640
You're not even dressed!

476
00:43:11,972 --> 00:43:13,720
Not dressed? What do you mean?

477
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,760
The theatre, remember?

478
00:43:17,623 --> 00:43:19,680
Yes. The theatre. Of course.

479
00:43:21,091 --> 00:43:23,120
Yeah, I am... I'm ready.
We should go.

480
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:25,824
Yeah?

481
00:43:27,921 --> 00:43:30,160
- I'll see you later, Abby.
- Sure.

482
00:43:35,273 --> 00:43:37,711
Abby, you look absolutely exhausted.

483
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,360
You really must let me talk to you
about makeup some time.

484
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:03,391
You realise you might
have compromised this whole...

485
00:44:03,511 --> 00:44:05,508
- project?
- <i>It was a mistake.</i>

486
00:44:05,905 --> 00:44:08,019
<i>Cutter wasn't meant to be there.
Won't happen again.</i>

487
00:44:08,139 --> 00:44:10,853
Well, I hope not,
because the consequences for you

488
00:44:10,973 --> 00:44:12,879
could be very bad.

489
00:44:13,313 --> 00:44:14,239
Now,

490
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:16,401
please try and stay out of sight
in the future.

491
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:18,520
It would make life easier for everyone.

492
00:44:24,067 --> 00:44:26,118
Hopefully Cutter won't remember him.

493
00:44:28,413 --> 00:44:30,364
Nick has an excellent

494
00:44:30,484 --> 00:44:31,989
memory for faces.

495
00:44:34,465 --> 00:44:36,994
I hope this isn't
going to go wrong, Oliver.

496
00:44:37,114 --> 00:44:40,247
I'd hate to think I'd put my faith
in the wrong man.

497
00:44:41,362 --> 00:44:43,400
Now that I see people very rarely,

498
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,201
it's hard to know if my judgement
is as good as it used to be.

499
00:44:50,508 --> 00:44:53,305
I hope you can deliver
what you promised.

500
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:54,458
I can.

501
00:44:55,856 --> 00:44:56,895
I can.

502
00:44:57,538 --> 00:45:00,524
Remember,
I have a lot riding on this as well.

503
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,304
Then I'm sure everything
is going to be just fine.
