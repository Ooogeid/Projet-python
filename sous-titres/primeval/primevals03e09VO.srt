Johnson's military. She can't storm in
without clearance.

13
00:02:40,864 --> 00:02:42,517
Yes, sir. I'm well aware of that.

14
00:02:42,682 --> 00:02:45,040
Based on a hunch
that she's got an active anomaly

15
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,450
{\pos(192,200)}and some mysterious woman from

OK, sir. You're the boss.

17
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,317
You're in a very understanding mood

DON'T ANSWER THE : FRONT DOOR.

23

- Come in.
- OK.

24
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,090
Follow me.

25
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:17,130
You'd better come through.

26
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:22,349
DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE.

27
00:04:23,735 --> 00:04:26,029
DON'T ASK ME WHY!

28
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,620
I expect you're wondering
why I'm here.

29
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,330
Rex was lonely.

30
00:04:47,991 --> 00:04:48,991
Guys!

31
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:55,350
That's cute.

32
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:02,787
I wanted to...

33
00:05:04,447 --> 00:05:06,096
I just don't want things
to be weird between us.

34
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,414
Absolutely. Me neither.

35
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:10,297
Me neither. Don't want any...

36
00:05:10,673 --> 00:05:12,231
Any sort of weirdness with...

37
00:05:13,988 --> 00:05:17,087
No weird areas here!

38
00:05:20,031 --> 00:05:21,588
I'm being weird, aren't I?

39
00:05:21,724 --> 00:05:23,488
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

40
00:05:26,982 --> 00:05:30,622
I don't... I don't suppose
now Jack's moved out that...

41
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:32,693
You know.

42
00:05:37,764 --> 00:05:38,928
They can move back in.

43
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,521
Wicked. That's great news.

44
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,541
Because I think
their lives are in danger.

45
00:05:46,332 --> 00:05:47,619
Living with Lester.

46
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,749
Literally. I think he -

47
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:52,560
It's fine.

48
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:56,038
We've missed them anyway.

49
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:57,202
Haven't we, Rex?

50
00:05:59,956 --> 00:06:01,120
See?

51
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:06,370
Nice place.

52
00:06:17,183 --> 00:06:18,250
You must love it here.

53
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,388
Oh... Yeah!

54
00:06:22,597 --> 00:06:23,898
It's not home though, is it?

55
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,923
<i>Anomaly alert! Where are you?</i>
(pub LG inside ^^)

56
00:07:10,537 --> 00:07:12,831
<i>For the last time, say your name.</i>

57
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,815
My officers tell me when they found
you, you tried to run. Why?

58
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,490
Who are you?
Who are you working for?

59
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,989
How did you come to be there?

60
00:07:24,929 --> 00:07:26,332
Let me explain something to you.

61
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,227
You're not leaving
until I get some answers.

62
00:07:28,723 --> 00:07:32,089
So unless you really like it here,
I suggest you start talking.

63
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:35,330
Tell me.

64
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,528
Everyone's dead. What difference
does it make who I am?

65
00:07:41,682 --> 00:07:43,138
You mean in the future?

66
00:07:46,105 --> 00:07:47,492
You know what happened?

67
00:07:47,612 --> 00:07:51,054
The predators.
They destroyed everything.

68
00:07:52,144 --> 00:07:53,755
And where did the predators
come from?

69
00:07:54,947 --> 00:07:56,728
I don't know. I wish I did.

70
00:08:07,847 --> 00:08:10,325
Come on! He did it to me
on my stag weekend.

71
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,621
So this is our chance
to get him back.

72
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:18,770
Joe, come on!

73
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:26,346
You promised me no stunts, right?

74
00:08:26,524 --> 00:08:27,757
Just a boys weekend.

75
00:08:28,578 --> 00:08:30,452
Yeah, sure. No stunts.

76
00:08:32,677 --> 00:08:35,103
Oh, no. Oh, come on, guys!

77
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:37,335
Go! Go!

78
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:45,084
This isn't funny.

79
00:08:45,512 --> 00:08:47,256
Give them back!

80
00:08:47,838 --> 00:08:49,071
Guys!

81
00:08:50,745 --> 00:08:52,370
Guys!

82
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,930
Wait! Get me... Yeah, very funny.
Are you...

83
00:09:09,628 --> 00:09:11,271
Gonna help me, or what?!

84
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:13,280
Guys, come back!
You can't leave me here!

85
00:09:25,394 --> 00:09:26,569
Guys!

86
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,102
Is that the best you can do?

87
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:33,708
Very funny.

88
00:09:42,803 --> 00:09:44,053
Oh, my god.

89
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:57,594
Guys!

90
00:10:10,064 --> 00:10:11,064
Help!

91
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,516
It's OK.

92
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:54,081
Tell me what this is.

93
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:59,386
I found it in the ruins,
but I have no idea what it is.

94
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:01,497
- I think it's broken.
- You're lying.

95
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:04,751
- What about anomalies? Go on!
- Anomalies?

96
00:11:07,045 --> 00:11:08,955
Anomalies are...

97
00:11:09,109 --> 00:11:10,751
rips in time.

98
00:11:13,729 --> 00:11:15,487
Some you can see.

99
00:11:15,624 --> 00:11:17,490
Others are invisible
to the naked eye.

100
00:11:20,377 --> 00:11:21,800
They're everywhere.

101
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,977
You just have to know
how to find them.

102
00:11:25,537 --> 00:11:27,279
And you know how to do that?

103
00:11:30,047 --> 00:11:31,450
- Yes.
- How?

104
00:11:33,563 --> 00:11:35,026
I'll show you.

105
00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:37,534
But first, I have to go
to the Anomaly Research Centre.

106
00:11:39,588 --> 00:11:41,950
What do you know about the ARC?

107
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:43,941
Take me there and I'll show you.

108
00:11:44,215 --> 00:11:47,947
- You don't give the orders.
- Take me to the ARC, then I'll help.

109
00:12:17,722 --> 00:12:19,194
What's all this?

110
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:22,637
The anomaly's somewhere over there.

111
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:27,943
Strange.
My detector's gone all funny.

112
00:12:28,063 --> 00:12:29,723
- So has mine.
- See?

113
00:12:30,477 --> 00:12:31,950
Really weird.

114
00:12:33,397 --> 00:12:34,544
Where's Danny?

115
00:12:35,177 --> 00:12:36,427
Where's Danny?

116
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:39,257
I'm sure he's on his way.

117
00:12:40,697 --> 00:12:42,375
Sausage, anyone?

118
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:51,017
Maybe later?

119
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,983
Ma'am.

120
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,974
Catch!

121
00:13:25,457 --> 00:13:26,655
Intruder!

122
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:28,572
Get her back to her room.

123
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,857
Come on, let's go.

124
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,149
There's so many.

125
00:14:20,185 --> 00:14:21,683
Better get this place evacuated.

126
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,573
They're incredible.

127
00:14:24,727 --> 00:14:27,056
- What are they?
- Embolotherium.

128
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,524
They're um...
They're prehistoric rhinos.

129
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:31,877
Peaceful grazers.

130
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,960
Peaceful. Are you sure about that?

131
00:14:38,097 --> 00:14:41,697
As sure as anybody can be on
the basis of a fossilised tooth.

132
00:14:49,318 --> 00:14:51,137
Oh, come on, little man!

133
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,777
I'm trying to help you. Just relax.

134
00:15:14,796 --> 00:15:16,097
<i>Over here!</i>

135
00:15:31,353 --> 00:15:32,817
Nice move.

136
00:15:35,444 --> 00:15:38,816
- I have to get out of here.
- I'm aware of that. Why the ARC?

137
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,889
I have to warn them.

138
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:42,737
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

139
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:48,566
Come on.

140
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:56,800
- What's going on?
- Danny Quinn.

141
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,990
He's in the building.

142
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:08,838
Lock down the building. Find them.

143
00:16:11,286 --> 00:16:12,286
Dammit!

144
00:16:13,577 --> 00:16:15,206
We're going to take a quick detour.

145
00:16:15,343 --> 00:16:17,536
There isn't time.
I've got to get to...

146
00:16:26,212 --> 00:16:27,239
Help!

147
00:16:27,907 --> 00:16:29,927
- There's someone in there.
- Help me, please!

148
00:16:30,849 --> 00:16:32,560
- Hello!
- Come on.

149
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:35,539
Through that lot?

150
00:16:35,866 --> 00:16:37,509
- Yeah.
- I'm in the tent!

151
00:16:43,497 --> 00:16:45,377
I'm guessing that's the bull.

152
00:16:47,161 --> 00:16:48,085
Yeah.

153
00:16:48,205 --> 00:16:49,283
Help!

154
00:16:51,286 --> 00:16:53,143
The bull's disrupting the herd.

155
00:16:53,383 --> 00:16:55,579
We can't risk going in
with him like this.

156
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:57,654
Someone needs to distract him.

157
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,068
Absolutely.

158
00:17:01,785 --> 00:17:03,291
- Me?
<i>- Somebody help me!</i>

159
00:17:03,496 --> 00:17:05,328
- I'm not...
- Please.

160
00:17:07,348 --> 00:17:08,373
Thanks.

161
00:17:10,136 --> 00:17:11,386
Look at me!

162
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,657
Come on!
Ignore the girls!

163
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:16,463
OK, I've got his attention.

164
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,435
- He likes me.
<i>- Is there anyone there?!</i>

165
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:20,284
<i>- They've got me surrounded!</i>
- Go!

166
00:17:20,847 --> 00:17:21,847
Go!

167
00:17:22,268 --> 00:17:24,070
- Come on!
- We'll be fine.

168
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:32,217
We should split up
and try and sneak through them.

169
00:17:35,842 --> 00:17:37,383
Sarah, are you OK?

170
00:17:41,111 --> 00:17:42,138
I'm all right!

171
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,057
Oh, god!

172
00:18:10,688 --> 00:18:13,817
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

173
00:18:23,596 --> 00:18:24,596
Hide.

174
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:43,446
Stop!

175
00:18:43,626 --> 00:18:45,441
Just stay there, don't panic!

176
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:55,600
If we make no sudden...

177
00:18:58,082 --> 00:18:59,469
Remember me?

178
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,158
Now you're looking at me.

179
00:19:21,615 --> 00:19:23,297
They're following the bull.

180
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,778
- What?
- Sounds like a baby.

181
00:19:44,172 --> 00:19:45,937
- Hey.
- What?

182
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,548
None of my business.

183
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:53,359
It's my stag weekend.

184
00:19:54,072 --> 00:19:55,072
Right.

185
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:01,050
What is it? And what are
those things out there?

186
00:20:01,255 --> 00:20:03,336
Let me get you out,
then we can chat.

187
00:20:04,189 --> 00:20:05,297
Wait a minute.

188
00:20:06,614 --> 00:20:08,479
You're not the stripper, are you?

189
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:11,320
Do you want to get out of here
alive?

190
00:20:11,475 --> 00:20:12,475
Or not?

191
00:20:12,862 --> 00:20:13,862
Sorry.

192
00:20:24,638 --> 00:20:26,376
That's the baby, right?

193
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:28,616
I guess so, yeah.

194
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,653
What have you done to yourself?

195
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:42,045
Listen, don't worry.
We're going to get you out of here.

196
00:20:42,447 --> 00:20:43,897
I promise.

197
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,137
Do I look like a stripper?

198
00:20:48,702 --> 00:20:51,321
- Well...
- Don't answer that.

199
00:20:55,561 --> 00:20:58,026
Abby, it's the mother coming back!

200
00:21:01,312 --> 00:21:04,056
She's heading for the tent!
Get out of there!

201
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,218
Come on, Abby!

202
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:10,577
You're going to have to help me
get this calf out of here, OK?

203
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,210
Sorry.

204
00:21:30,348 --> 00:21:32,137
She's going round the other side!

205
00:21:34,302 --> 00:21:36,699
You've got to calm the cow down!

206
00:21:36,969 --> 00:21:39,736
She's going to kill us
and the calf at this rate!

207
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:49,141
Easy.

208
00:21:50,161 --> 00:21:51,496
Easy.

209
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,829
OK, calm down.

210
00:22:01,177 --> 00:22:03,497
One, two, three!

211
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:14,210
Calm down. Slowly.

212
00:22:17,365 --> 00:22:18,392
Slowly.

213
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:38,567
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

214
00:22:41,391 --> 00:22:42,710
Sweet.

215
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,721
Not him.

216
00:22:49,252 --> 00:22:50,116
Them.

217
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:52,282
What have you been doing in there?

218
00:22:52,945 --> 00:22:54,691
Never mind.

219
00:22:55,693 --> 00:22:56,703
No.

220
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:10,195
Come on!

221
00:23:22,143 --> 00:23:24,377
Here you go, mate.
You'll be fine now.

222
00:23:25,143 --> 00:23:26,457
Cheers.

223
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,567
So... thanks...

224
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,617
for saving me from those...

225
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:38,666
The rhinos. Rare species.

226
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,596
By the way, is...

227
00:23:44,796 --> 00:23:46,011
Is this yours?

228
00:23:49,213 --> 00:23:50,213
Yeah.

229
00:23:54,417 --> 00:23:56,337
- Thanks.
- It's all right.

230
00:24:06,186 --> 00:24:07,777
- What?
- Nothing.

231
00:24:08,012 --> 00:24:09,399
In your own time.

232
00:24:09,655 --> 00:24:11,277
Anyone got any immediate ideas

233
00:24:11,397 --> 00:24:15,020
on how we get a herd of prehistoric
rhinos back through the anomaly?

234
00:24:15,174 --> 00:24:16,671
Good question.

235
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,417
Down there.

236
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:36,306
Really gently. That's great.

237
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:39,610
- What are we doing here?
- I don't know.

238
00:24:41,527 --> 00:24:43,264
Right. Stay here.

239
00:24:44,492 --> 00:24:48,215
- We're wasting time!
- This is important. Stay there.

240
00:24:54,448 --> 00:24:57,217
- Quinn, who is she?
- Long story.

241
00:24:58,091 --> 00:24:59,137
Where's Connor?

242
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:21,830
It's worked!

243
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,234
They're going through.

244
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:24,518
- Well done.
- Good job.

245
00:25:24,638 --> 00:25:25,638
Thanks!

246
00:25:42,647 --> 00:25:46,137
The anomaly is closing! We need
to get them back through faster!

247
00:25:50,332 --> 00:25:51,822
You're going to hit it!

248
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,519
That's the general idea.

249
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,149
Come on, ladies!

250
00:26:02,342 --> 00:26:04,951
You've got to get the bull
through the anomaly - now!

251
00:26:05,455 --> 00:26:07,320
I'm driving as fast as I can!

252
00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:17,303
Oh, no.

253
00:26:21,714 --> 00:26:24,007
<i>- Keep the bull away!</i>
- What?

254
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,790
The anomaly has closed.

255
00:26:27,057 --> 00:26:28,411
Too late!

256
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,177
They're heading for the campsite.

257
00:26:45,297 --> 00:26:47,697
We've got to get those people away.
Let's go!

258
00:27:00,948 --> 00:27:02,968
- All right, mate?
- Yeah, it's good.

259
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:17,825
We've got to get them
to change direction.

260
00:27:27,514 --> 00:27:29,267
Are you insane?!

261
00:27:29,387 --> 00:27:31,554
It depends who you ask. Hold tight.

262
00:27:37,383 --> 00:27:39,214
I think it's thunder.

263
00:27:40,207 --> 00:27:42,895
- They're too big!
- Have you got a better idea?

264
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:50,752
You told Johnson
you didn't know what that was.

265
00:27:50,889 --> 00:27:52,651
- Get me to the campsite.
- What is that?

266
00:27:52,772 --> 00:27:55,147
I'll explain later.
Just take me there now!

267
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:12,227
- Did you lot hear that?
- Yeah.

268
00:28:23,489 --> 00:28:25,458
You've got to get out of here!

269
00:28:25,612 --> 00:28:27,662
Come on, everyone! Get out!

270
00:28:29,105 --> 00:28:30,627
Go! Go! Go!

271
00:28:32,982 --> 00:28:34,227
Stay calm.

272
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:38,787
On your feet! Go!

273
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,077
Get out!

274
00:28:47,661 --> 00:28:48,706
Move!

275
00:28:49,151 --> 00:28:52,227
Everyone, move!
You haven't got time. Come on!

276
00:28:56,051 --> 00:28:57,352
Everybody out!

277
00:29:05,315 --> 00:29:06,393
No!

278
00:29:07,044 --> 00:29:08,910
Becker, stop!

279
00:29:12,808 --> 00:29:15,491
If you're going to do something,
now would be a good time!

280
00:29:47,939 --> 00:29:49,172
How did you do that?

281
00:29:51,354 --> 00:29:53,817
- The technology is simple enough.
- Really?

282
00:29:54,572 --> 00:29:55,856
Try me.

283
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,499
Another time.

284
00:29:58,442 --> 00:30:00,227
I don't believe that.

285
00:30:02,765 --> 00:30:04,737
Now will you help me? Please.

286
00:30:04,891 --> 00:30:07,720
I have to get a message
to a man called James Lester.

287
00:30:09,547 --> 00:30:12,253
I'm taking her to the ARC.
We'll meet you there.

288
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:14,074
I don't understand.

289
00:30:16,133 --> 00:30:17,708
Just get in the car.

290
00:30:19,116 --> 00:30:20,648
Look, this is her book.

291
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,431
- See what you make of it.
- Sure.

292
00:30:22,568 --> 00:30:24,228
Abby, you come with me.

293
00:30:45,675 --> 00:30:47,986
I'm bringing someone in to meet you.

294
00:30:48,175 --> 00:30:49,475
Who?

295
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:52,342
Out with it, Quinn.
You know I hate...

296
00:30:53,002 --> 00:30:54,227
surprises.

297
00:30:55,301 --> 00:30:56,451
Hello, James.

298
00:30:58,365 --> 00:31:02,062
I'd like to say it was always a pleasure,
but that would be a bare-faced lie.

299
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:07,125
What's this?

300
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,711
A warrant for the arrest
of Danny Quinn.

301
00:31:12,317 --> 00:31:14,166
What is it
that he's supposed to have done?

302
00:31:14,354 --> 00:31:16,913
We'll start with breaking and
entering and kidnapping.

303
00:31:17,534 --> 00:31:20,102
You know he broke into my HQ
this morning.

304
00:31:23,141 --> 00:31:27,048
Oh, you didn't. You really need
to get a grip, James.

305
00:31:27,407 --> 00:31:29,575
Make sure you read
all the way through.

306
00:31:29,995 --> 00:31:31,745
I wouldn't want you to miss the part
which requires

307
00:31:31,865 --> 00:31:34,147
the immediate
surrender of the artefact to me.

308
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,350
So...

309
00:31:39,651 --> 00:31:41,427
Where is she?

310
00:31:49,287 --> 00:31:50,287
Where is who?

311
00:31:59,372 --> 00:32:00,907
Hey. Well?

312
00:32:01,027 --> 00:32:02,147
Well what?

313
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:04,342
- Can you crack it?
- It's not a code.

314
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:07,462
Just loads of charts
and diary entries.

315
00:32:07,616 --> 00:32:08,954
What does it say?

316
00:32:09,108 --> 00:32:11,028
Not much. Look.

317
00:32:11,251 --> 00:32:12,667
333 here,

318
00:32:12,787 --> 00:32:14,287
here,

319
00:32:14,427 --> 00:32:15,427
here.

320
00:32:15,627 --> 00:32:17,860
There's times, places...

321
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,146
I'm going to have to read all of it.
See if it makes any sense.

322
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:30,386
- The boss would like to see you.
- Now?

323
00:32:30,523 --> 00:32:32,334
- Now.
- You stay here.

324
00:32:32,453 --> 00:32:33,541
Watch her.

325
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:47,343
Fascinating.

326
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:48,746
What is?

327
00:32:50,341 --> 00:32:51,467
All this.

328
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,741
Must be strange for you.

329
00:32:56,418 --> 00:32:57,428
Very.

330
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,655
Don't touch it.

331
00:33:06,035 --> 00:33:07,713
Why are you looking at me like that?

332
00:33:09,784 --> 00:33:11,205
I thought...

333
00:33:14,012 --> 00:33:15,012
Nothing.

334
00:33:16,156 --> 00:33:17,971
My eyes playing tricks on me.

335
00:33:21,352 --> 00:33:22,910
Been a long day.

336
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,427
Believe me,
it's only just beginning.

337
00:33:29,535 --> 00:33:31,022
Where is she?

338
00:33:31,193 --> 00:33:33,678
- Who?
- I suggest you co-operate, Quinn.

339
00:33:33,824 --> 00:33:36,872
Or I'll personally see to it that
you spend a very long time in jail.

340
00:33:37,002 --> 00:33:39,027
You're really going to have to work
on your small talk.

341
00:33:39,147 --> 00:33:40,684
Where is she?

342
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:43,990
I don't know. Your guess
is as good as mine.

343
00:33:44,137 --> 00:33:47,583
Even if I have to go to the ends
of the Earth, I'll find her.

344
00:33:49,914 --> 00:33:52,971
I assume we're talking about
a certain mystery woman.

345
00:33:53,147 --> 00:33:55,787
Quinn knows exactly
who I'm talking about.

346
00:34:01,307 --> 00:34:03,267
She's downstairs, isn't she?

347
00:34:03,749 --> 00:34:06,482
- Yeah.
- Nice work. Subtle.

348
00:34:12,992 --> 00:34:14,690
I thought I told you
to stay away from her.

349
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,625
I was using my initiative.

350
00:34:17,476 --> 00:34:20,208
And it's all turned out
so well, hasn't it?

351
00:34:24,536 --> 00:34:27,043
Mate, turn this around. Cheers.

352
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:28,307
Guys!

353
00:34:28,747 --> 00:34:30,240
Have a look at this.

354
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:33,907
Claudia Brown.

355
00:34:34,027 --> 00:34:36,827
Of all the names that could have
been here, why that one?

356
00:34:36,947 --> 00:34:39,547
Coincidence?
I don't believe in coincidence.

357
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:41,627
- Who's Claudia Brown?
- Hang on.

358
00:34:42,867 --> 00:34:46,867
There's only two people in the world
apart us who knew about Claudia Brown.

359
00:34:47,522 --> 00:34:50,122
- One was Cutter and the other...
- Come on!

360
00:34:57,467 --> 00:34:59,258
I know this might sound weird,

361
00:34:59,386 --> 00:35:01,126
but have we met?

362
00:35:05,297 --> 00:35:06,903
Wouldn't you remember me?

363
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:08,692
Suppose so.

364
00:35:11,748 --> 00:35:14,227
Of course, people change.

365
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:17,464
- What are you doing?
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

366
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,106
My, you have been busy.

367
00:35:23,814 --> 00:35:25,347
What's going on?

368
00:35:27,784 --> 00:35:29,849
Thanks for bringing me here, Danny.

369
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:32,672
I don't know how I would have
done it without you.

370
00:35:37,507 --> 00:35:39,507
You know nothing.

371
00:35:42,537 --> 00:35:45,123
Now give me the artefact
or she dies.

372
00:35:45,959 --> 00:35:47,195
Helen?

373
00:35:57,176 --> 00:35:58,383
It's close enough!

374
00:35:59,227 --> 00:36:00,426
Back off!

375
00:36:12,507 --> 00:36:14,667
There's no way out, Helen.

376
00:36:15,938 --> 00:36:17,947
I killed Nick.

377
00:36:18,535 --> 00:36:19,947
You know I'm not bluffing.

378
00:36:20,067 --> 00:36:22,542
And you know I have
absolutely no intention

379
00:36:22,662 --> 00:36:24,495
of letting you walk out of here.

380
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:26,986
Playing games with her life, James.

381
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:30,676
Go ahead. Shoot her.

382
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,724
- Perfectly fine with me.
- That is not funny.

383
00:36:34,914 --> 00:36:36,707
Depends where you're standing.

384
00:36:44,853 --> 00:36:46,507
Lower your weapons.

385
00:36:51,018 --> 00:36:52,856
Give her the artefact.

386
00:36:53,347 --> 00:36:55,307
- No.
- Do it.

387
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:58,269
Can't let her kill Christine.

388
00:36:58,661 --> 00:37:00,629
Contravenes health and safety.

389
00:37:01,447 --> 00:37:03,105
In any case, she won't get far.

390
00:37:10,707 --> 00:37:13,227
Just... tell me how.

391
00:37:16,253 --> 00:37:17,537
How you could...

392
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:19,911
kill your own husband.

393
00:37:20,172 --> 00:37:21,867
I had no choice.

394
00:37:24,347 --> 00:37:26,307
I loved him, Connor.

395
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:30,248
But he was part of all this.

396
00:37:31,846 --> 00:37:34,627
Part of everything that goes wrong.

397
00:37:35,226 --> 00:37:38,056
This is the beginning of the chaos.

398
00:37:39,293 --> 00:37:40,919
It all starts here.

399
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,267
What are you talking about?

400
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:48,400
I thought that killing Nick
would be enough, but it wasn't.

401
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,294
So now I have to finish it
once and for all.

402
00:37:56,157 --> 00:37:58,368
You follow, she's dead!

403
00:38:04,307 --> 00:38:06,467
You really think
I'm frightened of you?

404
00:38:06,925 --> 00:38:08,780
I really think I'm aware of that.

405
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:17,107
Take the artefact and leave.

406
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:19,678
I'll make sure no-one follows you.

407
00:38:19,857 --> 00:38:21,810
Is that the best you can do?

408
00:38:39,273 --> 00:38:41,533
So where exactly
are you planning on taking me?

409
00:38:41,663 --> 00:38:43,484
You've not worked it out yet?

410
00:38:44,476 --> 00:38:47,747
I'm surprised. I thought you were
supposed to be intelligent.

411
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:05,964
What are we doing here?

412
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,550
I have snipers all over this building.
They'll shoot you on sight.

413
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,909
- I don't think so.
- We're on the same side.

414
00:39:12,028 --> 00:39:14,305
We have the same goals.
We can share all of this.

415
00:39:14,425 --> 00:39:17,272
We have the artefact, control of the
anomalies. Think of the power.

416
00:39:17,418 --> 00:39:19,711
If you think this is about power,
you're wrong.

417
00:39:21,065 --> 00:39:23,364
- Then what is it about?
- It's all about you.

418
00:39:24,356 --> 00:39:25,754
You started this.

419
00:39:26,722 --> 00:39:30,010
One ambitious little civil servant
who ends the world.

420
00:39:30,644 --> 00:39:32,107
What are you talking about?

421
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:35,507
I've seen the future.

422
00:39:36,577 --> 00:39:38,983
And it's all your fault.

423
00:39:42,227 --> 00:39:43,548
Never mind.

424
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:46,665
None of it
is going to happen anyway.

425
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:48,716
None of it.

426
00:39:55,107 --> 00:39:56,976
- Out of the way!
- Do as she says!

427
00:40:28,188 --> 00:40:30,507
What are you going to do?
You've got what you want.

428
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:32,627
Didn't I tell you?
You're coming too.

429
00:40:33,499 --> 00:40:35,227
No. Not through there.

430
00:40:35,525 --> 00:40:37,330
What are you frightened of,
Christine?

431
00:40:37,444 --> 00:40:40,387
After all, it's a world you made.

432
00:40:56,307 --> 00:40:58,449
It's too late.
She's gone.

433
00:40:58,596 --> 00:41:00,114
What about Johnson?

434
00:41:06,009 --> 00:41:08,562
- Help me!
- I've got you. You're safe.

435
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:16,159
Hold on!

436
00:41:29,375 --> 00:41:32,156
We've got to stop Helen
before anyone else gets killed.

437
00:41:32,286 --> 00:41:35,199
- We don't know where she's gone.
- I think we do.

438
00:41:37,075 --> 00:41:38,874
The same place we lost your brother.

439
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:40,500
The future.

440
00:41:51,624 --> 00:41:53,201
The anomaly at the race track.

441
00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:55,688
- That leads to the same place.
- That's where we're going.

442
00:41:55,802 --> 00:41:58,680
- What are we going to do?
- Follow Helen wherever she goes.

443
00:41:58,815 --> 00:42:01,417
To the end of time if necessary.
