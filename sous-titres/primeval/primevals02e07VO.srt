1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,000
Rex?

2
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:05,700
I hear you've got me a present.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,300
I told you to keep your girlfriend away from him.

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:10,099
You'd better pray she hasn't hurt him.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,400
Where the hell is Stephen?

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,199
Cutter knows about the conspiracy.

7
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:19,600
Lester's the traitor.

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,500
Cutter can't see that.

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,199
Come with me.

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,500
Are you still in love with her?

11
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,300
I said who sent you?

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,199
Leek.

13
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,399
It was Leek.

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,000
Why would Leek try and kill me?

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,600
It's done. I planted the virus.

16
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,000
Leek won't know a thing about it until it turns round and bites him.

17
00:00:40,299 --> 00:00:42,200
I wondered who was gonna come and...

18
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,399
I was hoping it was gonna be you.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,799
Why are you so interested in these things?

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:32,700
Primeval
Series 2 Episode 7
Series Finale

21
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,799
All those creatures.

22
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:42,599
Why are they here?

23
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,400
What are they going to do with them?

24
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,299
Well, I could guess,

25
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,700
but what's the point?

26
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,599
It's gonna be OK. Helen's not interested in you.

27
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,700
She's your wife. You should have kept her under control.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You know what I mean.

29
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,099
I hope your fiance knows you're such an old-fashioned girl.

30
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,599
For your information, I don't have a fiance any more.

31
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,099
Why, what happened?

32
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:09,900
This job.

33
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Yeah.

34
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,699
He thought I'd met someone else.

35
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,300
Couldn't very well tell him it wasn't another man,

36
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:19,699
so much as a...

37
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,599
something-asaurus.

38
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,300
Anyway, the truth of the matter is I've been feeling...

39
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,900
..different recently.

40
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:33,099
Can we discuss this another time?

41
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,300
I didn't start it.

42
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,500
We do have other things to worry about.

43
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,000
Imminent death, for example.

44
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,699
It's OK. We're not gonna die.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,099
Helen's a lot of things, but she's not a killer.

46
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:45,300
You really think she's in charge here?

47
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,199
Yeah. Leek doesn't have the wit to do this on his own.

48
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,400
He's seen what I can do, yet he still belittles me.

49
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,599
It's your own fault, Oliver.

50
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,900
You're too good at being insignificant.

51
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,800
You won't forget our deal?

52
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,000
Nothing happens to Nick.

53
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,199
Er... I'd like to go home now. I don't want to be involved in anything...like this.

54
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,400
Caroline.

55
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,099
You leave her out of it. She's nothing to do with this.

56
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,099
What?

57
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,699
As someone really smart, you can be amazingly thick sometimes.

58
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,800
A girl like Caroline falling for a shambling, adolescent mess like you.

59
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,800
No, I don't think so.

60
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,000
I paid her to pick you up.

61
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,800
You see...

62
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,800
people like me and you...

63
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,599
...we don't get the pretty girls, Connor.

64
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:56,400
We're the nerds...

65
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,699
the losers...

66
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,300
the uncool.

67
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,000
Speak for yourself.

68
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,699
I do all right with women.

69
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,900
What? I do. I'm just...

70
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:08,699
I'm choosy.

71
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:09,599
Where's Rex?

72
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:11,199
Who cares?

73
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,599
I do. Now tell me.

74
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,800
I'm gonna enjoy this, Caroline.

75
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:20,899
Don't wanna hurt you, Abby.

76
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Don't flatter yourself.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You've got to stop this.

78
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,800
Why? I think it's very entertaining.

79
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,100
You are a sad little man, aren't you, Leek?

80
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,399
Fine. I'll stop it.

81
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,699
Guys£¬could we just -

82
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,500
That's enough. Stop.

83
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:04,399
Stop.

84
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:06,899
Thanks, Connor.

85
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,800
I didn't do it for you.

86
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,000
Lorraine, you're sure there are no messages?

87
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,199
No, sir.

88
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,899
And there's been no anomaly alert?

89
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,399
Where is everybody?

90
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:24,899
None of them are responding to their mobiles.

91
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,699
Leek is planning something and I want to know what it is!

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,800
I'm in position.

93
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,699
Whatever Leek's planning to do with those creatures

94
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,199
Helen will have her own agenda.

95
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,800
She always does.

96
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,300
Lester says she's mad.

97
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,000
No.

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,300
She's extraordinary.

99
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,800
Extraordinary? She tried to kill you.

100
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:02,300
No, no, no. That was Leek.

101
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,199
Bombs aren't Helen's style.

102
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,000
But hostage-taking is.

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,500
Well, she must have her reasons.

104
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,100
God.

105
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,399
Anyone would think you're still in love with the woman.

106
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,500
Yeah.

107
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,300
Probably am.

108
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:24,800
Not so much to do with love or hate any more. It goes much deeper than that.

109
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,300
We shared something that was unique.

110
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:31,899
We connected.

111
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,699
And there's nothing I can do about it.

112
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,000
OK, then.

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,800
Let me out of here now.

114
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,600
Hey, do you mind? Mate!

115
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,600
Do you wanna turn down the music?

116
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,199
Mate.

117
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,500
Hey.

118
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:20,800
Are you gonna turn it down or am I gonna have to come over there and turn it down for you?

119
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,100
What do you want?

120
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,399
Listen, Stephen, this is no time for sulking. People are dying...

121
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,200
right now and many more will die

122
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,000
unless YOU do something.

123
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Look...

124
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,399
Look, we need you.

125
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,500
There's been an attack at a beach. We think it's a Silurian Scorpion.

126
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,600
I can't get hold of Cutter.

127
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,799
How can I trust you?

128
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Why shouldn't you trust me?

129
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:26,100
Look, we haven't got time for this.

130
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,899
All right, tell me what's going on.

131
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,500
If I help you, I do it alone.

132
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,000
- You're going to need backup. - No.

133
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:36,399
If I so much catch sight of one of your men, I'm out.

134
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,899
It's time we talked.

135
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What about?

136
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,600
Fascinating.

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,899
The same as Claudia in every external detail.

138
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,500
Eyes, hair.

139
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,000
In all visible ways she's the same woman. And yet she's completely different.

140
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,700
Back off.

141
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,600
A little more aggressive perhaps than the original.

142
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:21,700
Claudia Brown becomes Jenny Lewis, a new person with a new identity.

143
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,500
Interesting.

144
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,100
As though nature allows only so much variation.

145
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,799
Listen, you can still save yourself.

146
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,100
Help us, and I'll make sure Lester goes easy on you.

147
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,700
I think you'd be happier with your friends.

148
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,600
Nick, you're with me.

149
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:49,899
Where have they taken Jenny?

150
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,100
Well, she's quite safe.

151
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,399
- So are the others. - Yeah?

152
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:54,399
So what's all this about?

153
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,700
A fresh start, Nick.

154
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,899
A new and better future.

155
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:01,200
Abby, Connor.

156
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,200
- How are you? Are you OK? - Yeah

157
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,700
I'm fine. How's Cutter?

158
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,799
He's OK. He's fine.

159
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,200
And how are you?

160
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:07,700
I'm all right.

161
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,600
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

162
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,500
It's all very touching.

163
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,299
Now if you don't mind...

164
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,100
You wanted answers.

165
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,399
Oh, my God.

166
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,600
The world changed in a new direction once before.

167
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:51,200
Your friend Jenny proves that if we can control the anomalies we can make it happen again.

168
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:54,500
- Doesn't that excite you?  - No.

169
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,700
I don't want to change the world, Helen. I happen to think it's rather beautiful just the way it is.

170
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,299
Do you know what happens when we interfere?

171
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:03,799
The damage we can cause.

172
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,500
We can't damage the future, Nick.

173
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,700
We can only alter it.

174
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
It can't hurt you.

175
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:18,700
Not unless Leek orders it to.

176
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:21,799
The neural clamp overrides its instincts.

177
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,700
You gave this technology to Leek?

178
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,500
And you found it in the future.

179
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,000
I discovered a lot of things.

180
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,399
You can too if you want.

181
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:37,299
Come on. I'll take you to Leek.

182
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,399
Let me go, please. I...I won't say anything.

183
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:46,200
You didn't know?

184
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,000
You're just in time for dinner.

185
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,600
Of course they'd prefer to hunt for their own food.

186
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,500
But it's amazing how quickly they can be trained.

187
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,000
Rex!

188
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
If it's me you really want to talk to...

189
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,200
why don't you just let the others go?

190
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,600
The last time the world changed, it was an accident.

191
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,200
But we can repeat that accident as an experiment under controlled conditions.

192
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,799
So what do you want to do is, you want to change the present just to see what happens in the future?

193
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,000
I knew you'd understand.

194
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,600
What happens if you destroy the human race during this experiment?

195
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:52,700
Then we bring it back again.

196
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:59,200
I'm going to wake up soon. I know I am.

197
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:01,399
This is just a dream.

198
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,100
Stop snivelling, for goodness sake.

199
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,200
Come on. Be nice.

200
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:07,299
I knew there was something fake about her.

201
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,899
The way she was all so lovey-dovey, and never even let you kiss her.

202
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:15,799
She did, actually.

203
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,600
Just never when you were around.

204
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:23,600
Well, couldn't you tell she was faking it?

205
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,899
Never mind.

206
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,200
I hate myself for what I did to you.

207
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,399
I was greedy and stupid.

208
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,899
I'm sorry.

209
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,000
You know I think this is why the anomalies first appeared, Nick.

210
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,200
So that we can help create the future!

211
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,899
No, everything, everything in nature is the result of random selection.

212
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:56,600
Now if we start to disrupt that perfect balance

213
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,899
then life just begins to unravel.

214
00:14:58,899 --> 00:14:59,899
I disagree.

215
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:02,500
Let's see who's right.

216
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,100
What's he doing here?

217
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
I invited him.

218
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,500
Well, never mind.

219
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,100
I wanted him to see this anyway.

220
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,600
Give away our location and your friends die.

221
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,899
Is it Cutter?

222
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,700
I'm afraid not.

223
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:29,700
But Cutter is here with me

224
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:30,700
and so are the others.

225
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,000
They're fine...

226
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,799
- for now. - It's only a matter of time until we track you down, Leek.

227
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,899
If you don't...

228
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:38,000
Listen to me.

229
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,899
An hour ago I released a Silurian Scorpion into a well-known holiday resort.

230
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,100
I can tell from your face it's already made an impact.

231
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,600
I've positioned another dozen creatures in similar locations.

232
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,299
Go on.

233
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:56,100
Call off the search or I shall let them go one by one.

234
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,200
What is it you really want, Leek?

235
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,500
Is it money?

236
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,399
I'll be in touch.

237
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,799
What about the scorpion?

238
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,299
That's your problem.

239
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,200
I want every available person out looking for those creatures.

240
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,299
And if Stephen calls for backup...

241
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,399
Make sure he gets it immediately.

242
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:00,200
It's done.

243
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,799
Come and get it whenever you like.

244
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Money? Money!

245
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:16,299
Is that what this is all about?

246
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:18,099
The anomalies are unstoppable now.

247
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:20,900
And in the future money will not mean very much

248
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,400
but knowledge and power will. And I intend to be very, very powerful.

249
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,799
You knew all of this and yet you still helped him.

250
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,299
I need the right environment to conduct my research.

251
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,000
What? What's going on?

252
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,700
What's happening?

253
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:39,400
What's happening?

254
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:43,200
Nothing good.

255
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:45,799
I underestimated you, Oliver.

256
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:49,099
You're...you're a lot smarter than I gave you credit for.

257
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:52,099
I know.

258
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,599
How did you figure out that we'd rigged the anomaly detector?

259
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh, it wasn't difficult to see you'd found my Spyware.

260
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,599
After that all I needed to do was remotely upload a modification from my laptop.

261
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,400
Simple, really.

262
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,700
Well, I never saw that coming.

263
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:10,400
No, of course you didn't.

264
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,799
But if you think that paying me compliments...

265
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,599
...is gonna buy your friends any more time...

266
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

267
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,400
What's going on?

268
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,500
I think the Americans call it dinner theatre.

269
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,000
I've got to get out.

270
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,299
Let me out!

271
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,599
No! We have to stick together.

272
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,200
It'll pick off any stragglers first.

273
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:57,400
Stay together.

274
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,700
Don't worry guys, Cutter will get us out of this.

275
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:02,700
Well, he better do soon.

276
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:04,400
Stop this!

277
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,700
All right.

278
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You've had your nasty little joke.

279
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,799
Who said anything about a joke?

280
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,299
Stop this. Now.

281
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,799
You do not give me orders!

282
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,299
No-one does.

283
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,000
Abby?

284
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,200
What are you doing?

285
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,000
I know this creature.

286
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,700
It's the one that killed Valerie.

287
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,799
I thought Leek said it was dead.

288
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,099
Well, it looks pretty well to me.

289
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,400
It has to decide if I'm dangerous.

290
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,900
Then what?

291
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,200
Then it eats me.

292
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,500
It's done.

293
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,099
- Both parts? - Both parts.

294
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,200
Leek won't know a thing about this until it turns round and bites him.

295
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,799
Cutter, that's pathetic.

296
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:33,299
I just patch my laptop up to the mainframe

297
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,700
and I still have complete control over...

298
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,900
COMPUTER: "Warning. Warning.

299
00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:38,700
System breach."

300
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:42,200
Don't bother. Connor planted a virus in the detector.

301
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,500
You downloaded it to your laptop when you hacked in.

302
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:48,400
In a couple of minutes, the whole system's gonna be paralysed.

303
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,099
"Security failure imminent.

304
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,799
Security system disabled."

305
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:54,599
Abby!

306
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Get out of there.

307
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,900
Oh, no, what about Cutter?

308
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,799
He'd want us to go.

309
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,799
We've got to get up to ground level.

310
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,599
"Warning. Animal containment facility offline."

311
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:22,299
"Warning. Warning. Animal containment facility offline."

312
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,000
You see, Nick?

313
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:27,700
We still make a good team.

314
00:23:31,099 --> 00:23:32,099
We're not a team.

315
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,200
I'm handing you over to Lester.

316
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:40,200
No, you won't do that.

317
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,900
I heard what you said in the cell. I know you still love me.

318
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,200
Don't flatter yourself.

319
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:52,200
I said exactly what you wanted to hear.

320
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:57,000
You knew the cell was bugged.

321
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,599
I thought it might be Leek's style.

322
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:01,700
So I thought I'd put on a little performance, just in case.

323
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,799
Oh, I'm sorry, honey, I didn't mean it.

324
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:08,599
I don't believe you.

325
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,799
I don't care.

326
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:15,299
Now, get in front of me before I shoot you.

327
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,799
I don't think you'll do that, Nick.

328
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,500
Helen.

329
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,099
"Warning. Warning. Warning.

330
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:46,700
Mainframe contacting external network.

331
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:49,000
Upload of data files commencing."

332
00:24:57,099 --> 00:24:58,099
What's going on?

333
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:01,099
The detector's networked to an external mainframe.

334
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,099
Well, stop it!

335
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:03,900
I can't.

336
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:05,200
Are we being sabotaged?

337
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,400
I don't think so.

338
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,599
It's sending us information.

339
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,099
Come on! Right this way!

340
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,700
It's OK. Scutosaurus.

341
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,099
- We need to hit it!  - What?

342
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:41,599
Hit it!

343
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:44,900
Wait, wait.

344
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,400
I'll take that, thank you.

345
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,799
Right, come on.

346
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,099
(Heartbeat slow down)

347
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,099
I've had enough of this.

348
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:42,200
Where have you been?

349
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,900
"Listen, Stephen, there isn't much time."

350
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,000
Lester kidnapped me.

351
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,299
"I got away but I need you to come and get me."

352
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:49,500
Kidnapped?

353
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,500
Nick and the others are dead.

354
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,400
"Lester had them killed."

355
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,400
Stephen...

356
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:06,099
Listen.

357
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:07,700
Stephen, listen

358
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,599
"Lester's gonna call you. Whatever he says, it's a trap."

359
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:14,000
I'm going to tell you where I am, and then throw your mobile away.

360
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,500
They can trace you with it.

361
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,400
Which direction now?

362
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:41,799
Any ideas?

363
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:46,000
OK

364
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,500
This way, then.

365
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,400
Wait. Wait...

366
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,500
It's Rex!

367
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:08,000
It's Rex!

368
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:10,200
Rex!

369
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:13,500
Rex!

370
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,900
Rex, Turn around!

371
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,599
I can feel a draught.

372
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,400
Not our most pressing problem now.

373
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,799
We really don't have time for this!

374
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:26,900
Fresh air.

375
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:29,500
Connor!

376
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,599
It's Rex. He's found a ventilation shaft to the surface.

377
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,700
Come on.

378
00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:37,900
You first, Abby.

379
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,000
Where did you learn to shoot like that?

380
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,200
Most of my friends liked Pony Club.

381
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,200
I preferred clay pigeons.

382
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,099
Brilliant.

383
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:58,299
Brilliant.

384
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:06,900
Wait!

385
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:09,400
Oh, my God, it's Rex, he's been hit.

386
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:11,500
Rex!

387
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,599
Is he all right?

388
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,099
I think so.

389
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:16,599
Come on.

390
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,500
I got him in here.

391
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,099
The least I can do is get him out.

392
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,500
Will he be OK?

393
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,700
He'll be fine.

394
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,200
Thank you.

395
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,000
Guys, we've got to get hold of Lester.

396
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,799
Clearly a design fault.

397
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:17,000
I'll have to correct that in the others.

398
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,799
What others?

399
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:43,299
I wouldn't bother trying to escape.

400
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:45,599
They'll rip you to pieces before you could blink.

401
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:48,200
My very own Praetorian guard.

402
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,700
They'll make me untouchable.

403
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,099
You really think you can keep them locked up for long?

404
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:55,900
Properly chipped

405
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,199
they're no more dangerous than a car or an aeroplane.

406
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,599
A machine, designed for human use.

407
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,699
No, that's not how it's gonna work, Oliver.

408
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:08,199
Because one day they're gonna escape. And then when they do, they're gonna kill all of us.

409
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,500
You're looking at the end of the human race.

410
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,300
I'd love to stand around, discuss your apocalyptic fantasies all day, Professor...

411
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,699
but unfortunately...

412
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,199
I've got work to do.

413
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:23,699
Now, in a few minutes, the mainframe will have eliminated the virus.

414
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,699
Unfortunately, your friends have escaped.

415
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,699
Lester will soon know where I am.

416
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,000
But...

417
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,699
I have you!

418
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,599
And I don't think he'll attack me.

419
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,300
I wouldn't bet on that.

420
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,400
What is this place?

421
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:12,400
I don't know.

422
00:35:12,699 --> 00:35:14,300
Lester's people brought me here.

423
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,099
What happened to Cutter?

424
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,300
There are creatures here, Stephen.

425
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,199
He was killed.

426
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,099
You saw it?

427
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,900
Where's Lester?

428
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,800
Oh, he's too powerful, Stephen.

429
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,599
We can't stay here.

430
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,500
I've been thinking.

431
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,300
We should find another anomaly

432
00:35:43,699 --> 00:35:45,800
wait on the other side until it's safe.

433
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,599
We have to confront him.

434
00:35:49,099 --> 00:35:50,300
Stephen, we have to go.

435
00:35:51,699 --> 00:35:52,699
He killed my friends.

436
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,599
You've had your chance to surrender, Leek.

437
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,000
I still have 12 creatures out there.

438
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,900
One command from me and there'll be absolute chaos.

439
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:03,800
Cutter didn't tell you?

440
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,500
That clever little virus of his sent us the contents of your hard disk.

441
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,599
We found names, locations, all sorts of useful stuff.

442
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:14,400
We're just mopping up the last of your menagerie now.

443
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,300
Oh, and Jenny just phoned.

444
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:17,800
You have...

445
00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:19,800
oh, just a few minutes before we join you.

446
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:23,000
Now, if you don't mind, I think there's some snooker on the other channel.

447
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,099
Have you ever seen...

448
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,199
A man torn in half on live TV, Lester?

449
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,199
Call a halt to your men

450
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,699
Or I shall order these creatures to dismantle Professor Cutter...

451
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:38,000
joint by joint.

452
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,099
The government does not negotiate with hostage-takers.

453
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:45,000
30 seconds, then they kill him. Your choice.

454
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,199
James, don't do it. I'm not important.

455
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,500
Ten...

456
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,300
Unfortunately, I agree with Professor Cutter.

457
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:56,500
Eight, Seven, six, five...

458
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:00,099
No individual's life is more important than the protection of the public.

459
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,199
Four, three, two, one...

460
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,400
What have you done?

461
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,099
They're gonna kill us all!

462
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:32,800
No!

463
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,599
Switch that off.

464
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,500
There's no time.

465
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,400
Forget about Lester, it's too late.

466
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,099
Finish this now, Helen.

467
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:11,300
You said he was dead.

468
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,099
What have you done?

469
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,699
Not you, too?

470
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,099
Don't tell me you knew about this.

471
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:22,900
Oh, I have never seen this place before in my life.

472
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,199
I told you the truth!

473
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:26,500
Lester brought me here.

474
00:38:26,699 --> 00:38:29,800
You ask her, ask her about what she really wanted to do.

475
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,199
Go on, ask her about Leek, ask her about how many people were gonna die.

476
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:35,000
He's trying to trick you.

477
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,800
I so badly wanted to believe in you.

478
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,699
But it doesn't put you in the right!

479
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:44,699
Stephen, there's a whole army of predators in here.

480
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
If any of them make it above ground, there's gonna be nobody left.

481
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,300
Now, if you want to help people, we have to do this.

482
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,000
They're too powerful, Nick.

483
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,500
Nothing you can do.

484
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,599
Well, you're gonna have to think of something

485
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,300
or we're all gonna die.

486
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,000
Now, you brought them here. You know them.

487
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:11,199
The siren.

488
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,699
The creatures associate the sound with food.

489
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:19,599
They'll come back to the cage room whenever it sounds.

490
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,199
If we can lock them in with the predators, they'll destroy each other.

491
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,099
Come on, then.

492
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,699
It's working.

493
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,300
Let's get out of here.

494
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:51,400
I'll seal the door.

495
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:52,599
Nothing will get out.

496
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,900
Stephen, shoot it!

497
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,900
The creatures are almost here.

498
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,900
Come on, Nick!

499
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,099
We can't close the door!

500
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Or otherwise they're gonna get back out.

501
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:34,500
We can only do that from in there now.

502
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,800
The control is on the other side. Whoever does it gets locked in.

503
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,000
One of us has got to go back in.

504
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:55,400
I'll do it.

505
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:01,400
You'll never make it out.

506
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:02,599
Get out of here.

507
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:11,099
Just remember, Lester's not the enemy.

508
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,599
Nick, please!

509
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,199
Stephen!

510
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,099
Sorry, mate. I'm doing this one.

511
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,900
No! Open the door!

512
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,099
Open it!

513
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,500
Can't do it, Nick.

514
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:29,800
Can't take the risk.

515
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,500
Stephen, open the door!

516
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,000
Tell Abby and Connor...

517
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,199
..to stay out of trouble.

518
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,099
Connor...

519
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,400
I just wanted to say...sorry.

520
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,099
I was thinking that...

521
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:21,599
Well, you...you have my number.

522
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,300
Drink?

523
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,500
Another time, then.

524
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,199
Yeah.

525
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:52,800
Yeah, that would be nice.

526
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,800
Cutter!

527
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,099
Had a call from the ARC. New anomaly.

528
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:00,599
Better get going.

529
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,400
Sorry.

530
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,800
Bad timing.

531
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:22,099
Cutter!

532
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:24,599
Are you coming?

533
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,500
Sure.

534
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:10,099
Be patient, Stephen.

535
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:12,199
Things can change.

536
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,000
More than you'll ever know.

537
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:48,800
THE END OF SERIES TWO
