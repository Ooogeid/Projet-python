00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:34,666
<i>I'd like you all to meet
your new colleague.</i>

3
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:36,240
<i>This is Jennifer Lewis.</i>

4
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,280
<i>Jenny Lewis. Pleased to meet you.</i>

5
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:42,360
Ms Lewis has been appointed
to a senior position the team.

6
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,000
That means she answers to me,
and you lot answer to her.

7
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,623
- I didn't think we answered to anybody.
- Scientists!

8
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:49,147
That's quite all right, James.

9
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:51,600
I'm used to working
with creative people.

10
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,640
Please do all call me Jenny.

11
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,040
- Claudia.
- My name's not Claudia.

12
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,219
I think you're confusing me
with somebody else.

13
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:02,695
I know you think
your name's Jenny Lewis,

14
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:05,240
but you're actually a woman
called Claudia Brown.

15
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,257
There's a good reason for this.
I can explain.

16
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,080
Meet professor Nick Cutter,

17
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,549
a fascinating study in the tipping
point between inspiration and lunacy.

18
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,840
Is everything all right, Professor?

19
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,813
I know this sounds insane. But...

20
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:21,040
you're a woman called Claudia Brown.
Just listen.

21
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,960
The anomaly detector, Professor.
You said that we should talk about it.

22
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:27,901
Could we do that now?

23
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,320
- It's Claudia Brown.
- I know.

24
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,130
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I know that's what you believe.

25
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,120
Me, I've never seen that
woman before in my life.

26
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,680
What's going on?

27
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:41,120
Come on, Professor.
You can't go flaky on us now.

28
00:03:41,445 --> 00:03:43,730
I mean, it's nearly 12, and...

29
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,387
we're probably going to have
to save the world again before bedtime.

30
00:03:48,901 --> 00:03:50,187
Sorry. OK.

31
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:53,019
No more of this Claudia Brown stuff?

32
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,483
At least until you can
figure out what's going on.

33
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,440
Please accept my apologies.
It wasn't my intention to frighten you.

34
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,700
No problem.

35
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:06,648
Now, perhaps one of you
can tell me what I'm doing here.

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,970
Your job's to come
up with cover stories.

37
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,320
In essence, that means convincing
people they didn't see

38
00:04:13,594 --> 00:04:14,920
what they actually did.

39
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,879
Keeping the public current
is the government's top priority.

40
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:19,227
Nicely put.

41
00:04:19,731 --> 00:04:20,680
Dinosaurs!

42
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,280
Oh, come on!

43
00:04:23,676 --> 00:04:26,000
- What's this about really?
- One thing I can promise you

44
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,400
this job's quite unlike
anything you've done before.

45
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,360
I doubt it. When you've been
in PR as long as I have,

46
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,138
nothing much can surprise you any more.

47
00:04:33,258 --> 00:04:35,560
Take Jenny down to Human Resources
and finish the paperwork.

48
00:04:38,057 --> 00:04:38,960
Classy.

49
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,359
Very classy.

50
00:05:35,663 --> 00:05:38,640
- All set, Shelley? Feeling good?
- Fine, thanks, Terry.

51
00:05:39,896 --> 00:05:42,080
It's only five million quid
and all our jobs on the line.

52
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,400
Let me rephrase that
it's five million quid and your job.

53
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,683
No pressure, then.

54
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:48,653
Nothing goes wrong today,

55
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:50,200
and I mean nothing.

56
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:07,820
Lambert Smith has a proven track record
in the premium drinks arena.

57
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:12,188
Our aim is to make the Nagata
brand the best-selling Japanese beer

58
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,893
in the UK market
within the next three years.

59
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,800
Make that two years.

60
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:18,760
Two years.

61
00:07:19,246 --> 00:07:21,379
We believe this product has wide appeal

62
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:23,565
to younger women
in the upper income groups.

63
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:27,880
Don't stop now, Shelley.
You're getting to the good part.

64
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,114
Something wrong?

65
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:32,441
It's just a fire drill.
It'll stop in a minute.

66
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:35,957
As I was saying,
our campaign will focus on...

67
00:07:51,073 --> 00:07:54,192
- What's that smell?
- Smells like sulphur.

68
00:07:56,537 --> 00:07:58,137
There's no fire in here.

69
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:03,200
- What's that?
- I've no idea.

70
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:12,142
Chief?

71
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,826
Chief?

72
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,877
Get out of here!

73
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,294
Get out.

74
00:08:24,945 --> 00:08:25,855
Run!

75
00:08:26,944 --> 00:08:28,371
Chief!

76
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:34,219
Every time an anomaly opens it gives
off a burst of radio interference.

77
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,360
We didn't spot it before
because we weren't looking for it.

78
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,935
And you can build a machine
that detects this interference?

79
00:08:41,274 --> 00:08:44,157
It's the same as tracking
down a pirate radio station,

80
00:08:44,277 --> 00:08:48,674
and then we can also develop a hand-held
detector to work within short distances.

81
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:52,719
And we'll be able to spot
the anomalies as soon as they open?

82
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,449
Yes, that's the idea.

83
00:08:55,454 --> 00:08:57,840
- Would it be expensive?
- Only if we do it properly.

84
00:08:58,232 --> 00:09:01,125
I think this is something
we should consider, sir.

85
00:09:01,245 --> 00:09:03,954
Seems to be our most
significant breakthrough to date.

86
00:09:04,074 --> 00:09:06,271
I do understand the implications, Leek.

87
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,236
Fine. Tell Leek what you need.
He'll see to it.

88
00:09:10,356 --> 00:09:13,000
I want Connor to supervise the work.

89
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,121
All right,

90
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:15,644
but he reports to Leek.

91
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,164
I've planned a bold
and innovative campaign

92
00:09:26,284 --> 00:09:29,240
featuring internationally
known celebrity girlfriends.

93
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:31,120
Can you smell something?

94
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,240
Smell?

95
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,608
One moment, please.

96
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,440
Perhaps you'd like to look
at some mock-ups, Mr Nagata?

97
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,172
Do something.

98
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:44,055
All right.
I'll go and see what's going on.

99
00:09:46,157 --> 00:09:47,388
We're on fire!

100
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:52,800
I'll go and get it. Just... stall him.

101
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,577
I think you'll find it's
my choice tonight, Connor.

102
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:33,571
What are you talking about?
You chose last week.

103
00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:36,550
Do you really think I would have
chosen the Texas Chainsaw Massacre?

104
00:10:37,956 --> 00:10:40,344
How about something
romantic for a change?

105
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:42,495
- Romantic?!
- Yeah.

106
00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:46,000
How about The Holiday?

107
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,997
- Looks nice.
- That's like my worst nightmare.

108
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,610
I don't know.

109
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:57,720
I'm gonna go home. You choose.

110
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,008
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

111
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,149
But no horror, no action.
Definitely no sci-fi. Bye.

112
00:11:03,347 --> 00:11:04,160
Bye.

113
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:08,760
Hostel. Classic. Good choice.

114
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:11,376
But this...

115
00:11:11,968 --> 00:11:13,190
this is really good.

116
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,760
Sorry. Just...

117
00:11:20,241 --> 00:11:22,650
- Have you seen this one?
- It's not bad.

118
00:11:22,971 --> 00:11:24,328
I preferred the original.

119
00:11:27,475 --> 00:11:28,447
Me too.

120
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:34,280
I don't really feel like horror tonight.
I feel like something a bit more...

121
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,112
Erotic... Romantic?

122
00:11:39,297 --> 00:11:41,160
Fantasy, sci-fi, something like that.

123
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:43,560
You couldn't recommend anything,
could you?

124
00:12:08,077 --> 00:12:09,103
Helen.

125
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:10,520
Stephen.

126
00:12:13,716 --> 00:12:15,920
I'm sorry.
I didn't know where else to go.

127
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,640
I think I need help.

128
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:19,526
What happened?

129
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:23,861
Getting eggs for breakfast
wasn't so easy in the Cretaceous.

130
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:26,320
- What did this to you?
- A pterosaur.

131
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,640
You need antibiotics.

132
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,320
Stephen, I need sleep.

133
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,236
A decent night's sleep
without anything trying to eat me.

134
00:12:40,457 --> 00:12:41,494
Let me stay.

135
00:12:42,843 --> 00:12:44,074
Just for a little while.

136
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:47,179
You'll live.

137
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:50,640
- Do you care?
- Yeah.

138
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:57,796
I'm sorry about what happened.
I was angry.

139
00:12:59,455 --> 00:13:00,720
I didn't mean to hurt you.

140
00:13:01,056 --> 00:13:01,940
You did.

141
00:13:02,671 --> 00:13:03,929
You hurt everyone.

142
00:13:04,804 --> 00:13:06,080
And always do.

143
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,972
Report in from the city.

144
00:13:23,092 --> 00:13:24,720
Looks like a new anomaly, sir.

145
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,593
It's a fire. Nothing to do with us.

146
00:13:26,713 --> 00:13:29,285
We intercepted mobile calls
from inside the building,

147
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:32,782
and there's a lot of chatter about
foul-smelling gases, and a possible

148
00:13:32,902 --> 00:13:34,080
creature sighting.

149
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,478
What kind of creature?

150
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:38,131
No information on that yet.

151
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:39,787
Creature?

152
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,720
Abby?

153
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,760
This is Caroline.

154
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:50,342
Well...

155
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,880
What is that thing?

156
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,280
That thing is my lizard.

157
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,040
That's Rex. He's harmless.
He's really cool.

158
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,860
Hello, Rex.

159
00:14:03,548 --> 00:14:06,723
I'm sorry. He's not...
He doesn't normally do that.

160
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,334
Bad lizard. Bad Rex!

161
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:17,224
I suppose he's just doing
what his instinct dictates.

162
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:22,193
I've invited Caroline round
to watch this DVD with us.

163
00:14:22,313 --> 00:14:23,520
You don't mind, do you?

164
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,946
Only Connor and I were
having such a good time.

165
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,398
- He's really funny, isn't he?
- Yeah.

166
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,480
Yeah.

167
00:14:30,947 --> 00:14:33,840
- So, are you two a couple, then?
- Me and Connor?

168
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,480
No. God, no.
As if.

169
00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:43,074
You don't have to make
it sound quite so unlikely.

170
00:14:43,442 --> 00:14:44,605
Who is she?

171
00:14:45,462 --> 00:14:46,254
Dunno.

172
00:14:46,617 --> 00:14:48,078
Picked me up at the video shop.

173
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,379
She picked you up?

174
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,940
Yeah.

175
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:53,927
A lot of women find me attractive.

176
00:14:55,522 --> 00:14:57,026
- What?
- Nothing.

177
00:14:57,767 --> 00:15:00,921
Look, I think she really likes me,
so don't muck it up for me, OK?

178
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:07,966
Why does it have to be now?

179
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:10,592
Not funny.

180
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,808
Caroline, hey...

181
00:15:12,928 --> 00:15:15,777
I am so sorry,
but something's just come up.

182
00:15:16,838 --> 00:15:19,240
I'm gonna have to go. It's work.

183
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:23,080
Shame.
Do you have a pen?

184
00:15:23,836 --> 00:15:25,880
Pen? Yeah.

185
00:15:29,956 --> 00:15:31,615
We have pens.

186
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:34,745
Here you go.

187
00:15:35,838 --> 00:15:36,880
Loads of pens.

188
00:15:46,104 --> 00:15:47,447
Here's my number.

189
00:15:51,795 --> 00:15:52,612
Call me.

190
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,272
It's good to know
we can still be friends.

191
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,960
- I have to go.
- Is that Nick?

192
00:16:16,588 --> 00:16:18,632
His Master's Voice.

193
00:16:20,326 --> 00:16:21,960
I want you gone by the time I get back.

194
00:16:33,782 --> 00:16:37,332
You don't really expect me to buy
all this stuff about dinosaurs?

195
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:39,002
Honestly? No.

196
00:16:41,464 --> 00:16:44,045
- Can you stop doing that, please?
- Doing what?

197
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:45,715
Staring at me.

198
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:47,572
I'm not allowed to look at you?

199
00:16:47,692 --> 00:16:49,815
- Not like that.
- Like what?

200
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:51,485
Like you know me.

201
00:16:51,824 --> 00:16:53,331
See, I feel like I do know you.

202
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:55,769
You don't, because if you did
I'd be aware of it, wouldn't I?

203
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:56,901
Not necessarily.

204
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,520
Lester told me you were... odd.

205
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,323
Don't put too much faith
in anything Lester says.

206
00:17:03,443 --> 00:17:04,748
I don't see why not.

207
00:17:04,868 --> 00:17:06,909
He seems like a very impressive man.

208
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:09,873
You're right - I
probably don't know you.

209
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:13,103
You can't come in here.

210
00:17:13,223 --> 00:17:15,337
Sorry,
this is a matter of national security.

211
00:17:15,457 --> 00:17:17,877
Can you ask your men to
withdraw until I give the all-clear?

212
00:17:17,997 --> 00:17:20,239
I want all these people back about...

213
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:23,907
half a mile, and if any of your team
speak to the press, they're fired.

214
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,716
I'd do as she says.
Are you always this bossy?

215
00:17:27,836 --> 00:17:30,142
I understand the object's
to get the job done.

216
00:17:31,162 --> 00:17:33,800
- So, what have we got?
- Some kind of chemical leak.

217
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:38,344
We've got a few idiots who ignored
the alarm trapped on the 14th floor.

218
00:17:38,812 --> 00:17:40,841
Two of my firefighters
are in there as well.

219
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:41,922
OK.

220
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:44,170
Sorry, sorry.
I got here as soon as I could.

221
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:45,863
Everything all right?

222
00:17:46,987 --> 00:17:48,564
Yeah, everything's fine.

223
00:17:50,665 --> 00:17:52,125
Where are you going?

224
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:55,322
- What am I supposed to do?
- You'll think of something.

225
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:11,694
If there's no fire, the lift'll be safe.

226
00:18:18,947 --> 00:18:20,567
It smells like sh...

227
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:22,669
something rotting.

228
00:18:24,106 --> 00:18:27,760
Their version of the Earth's atmosphere.
It's probably Pre-Cambrian.

229
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:30,383
It's high in sulphur and carbon dioxide.

230
00:18:30,503 --> 00:18:32,573
<i>Help, help!</i>

231
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:37,216
Are you all right?

232
00:18:37,336 --> 00:18:39,143
There's something inside the fog.

233
00:18:44,337 --> 00:18:45,637
Give me your axe.

234
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,725
Come on.

235
00:18:59,981 --> 00:19:00,974
Here.

236
00:19:01,937 --> 00:19:03,163
Do your job.

237
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,959
Get us out of here.

238
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,401
Run!

239
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,605
Shut the door!

240
00:19:35,683 --> 00:19:36,560
It's dead.

241
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,080
- What happened?
- I'm not sure.

242
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,840
But I think it might be from
even further back than we thought.

243
00:19:48,998 --> 00:19:52,080
The oxygen in our atmosphere
must be like poison to it.

244
00:19:52,499 --> 00:19:54,718
It can't breathe outside the fog.

245
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:58,017
We've got to clear it out.

246
00:19:59,261 --> 00:20:01,320
Get onto to Connor.
Tell him to think of something.

247
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:06,342
They said there was a fire
in the server room on the 15th floor.

248
00:20:07,568 --> 00:20:11,069
But there wasn't. Just this... fog.

249
00:20:11,396 --> 00:20:14,240
- And something glowing.
- The anomaly.

250
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:17,434
It's a long story.

251
00:20:17,554 --> 00:20:19,956
Stick to the stairs.
Stay out of the fog on your way down.

252
00:20:20,076 --> 00:20:23,280
- There's still people trapped up there.
- I know. You've done enough.

253
00:20:23,883 --> 00:20:26,234
- Go on.
- You keep it.

254
00:20:27,456 --> 00:20:30,080
- You might need it.
- All right, thanks.

255
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,836
Are you all right? What's going on?

256
00:20:38,956 --> 00:20:40,865
If I told you you wouldn't believe me.

257
00:20:41,332 --> 00:20:44,077
Go to the police.
Don't talk to anyone until I say so,

258
00:20:44,197 --> 00:20:46,040
- and you'll be debriefed later.
- OK.

259
00:21:01,228 --> 00:21:03,243
We should just make a run for it.

260
00:21:03,944 --> 00:21:06,849
- We can't just sit here.
- If we go out there...

261
00:21:06,969 --> 00:21:08,601
You saw what happened to Terry.

262
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,824
Can someone just get us out of here?

263
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,120
Please.

264
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,177
They're inside the building now,
but frankly,

265
00:21:19,297 --> 00:21:21,408
James, I have no idea what's happening.

266
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,995
They won't talk to me.

267
00:21:24,277 --> 00:21:25,084
OK.

268
00:21:44,712 --> 00:21:45,736
What do we do now?

269
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,960
Can't go up. The fog's too thick.

270
00:21:50,326 --> 00:21:51,260
The lifts?

271
00:21:51,697 --> 00:21:55,416
Cutter, will someone please tell me
what the hell is going on in there?!

272
00:21:59,807 --> 00:22:01,208
Tenner says I get it first.

273
00:22:03,123 --> 00:22:04,142
Yeah, all right.

274
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,356
Back to the stairs!

275
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:43,662
Stephen?

276
00:22:46,391 --> 00:22:47,287
Stephen!

277
00:22:59,288 --> 00:23:01,384
None of this stuff is any use.

278
00:23:01,504 --> 00:23:04,354
This is the latest
in high-tech weaponry.

279
00:23:04,877 --> 00:23:07,563
There's equipment here that would
make James Bond cry with envy.

280
00:23:07,949 --> 00:23:09,245
I understand that,

281
00:23:09,841 --> 00:23:11,885
but we need something
that's gonna clear fog.

282
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:14,977
Well, find something
that'll clear fog, then.

283
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:20,221
Garden centre.

284
00:23:23,794 --> 00:23:25,760
Abby, you are officially a genius.

285
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:36,352
I know you, don't I?

286
00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:39,120
I work here.
You've probably seen me around.

287
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,735
We haven't got time for this.

288
00:23:41,377 --> 00:23:43,312
- Come on.
- Abby, come here a sec.

289
00:23:43,854 --> 00:23:45,649
Did you see the scars
on that guy's neck?

290
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,437
No.

291
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:48,678
They were just...

292
00:23:49,392 --> 00:23:52,720
I swear that was the guy
from the shopping mall. The cleaner.

293
00:23:53,001 --> 00:23:54,240
After the raptor attacked

294
00:23:54,758 --> 00:23:56,058
he just vanished.

295
00:23:57,074 --> 00:23:58,524
Come on - you must remember him.

296
00:23:58,644 --> 00:24:00,800
I didn't really look at him, and anyway,

297
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,572
why would one of Lester's soldiers

298
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,621
pretend to be a cleaner
in a shopping mall?

299
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:06,680
Come on.

300
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:09,068
It really...

301
00:24:09,188 --> 00:24:10,601
really did look like him.

302
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,476
Cutter?

303
00:25:26,876 --> 00:25:28,520
- Yeah, it's me.
- Where are you?

304
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,000
It doesn't matter. Listen -

305
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,313
the place is infested,
so don't come looking for me.

306
00:25:35,436 --> 00:25:36,640
I'll find my own way up.

307
00:25:42,405 --> 00:25:45,080
It's me. Why haven't you been
answering any of my calls?

308
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,200
<i>Been a bit busy.</i>

309
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,477
Listen, I'm coming up.

310
00:25:47,597 --> 00:25:49,317
<i>No, don't do that.</i>

311
00:25:49,551 --> 00:25:51,922
I'm tired of this.
I want to know what's going on, and

312
00:25:52,042 --> 00:25:54,280
- quite frankly, you can't stop me.
<i>- All right.</i>

313
00:25:55,033 --> 00:25:58,720
You take the stairs to the 12th floor.
I'll meet you there.

314
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,163
<i>Don't use the lifts.</i>

315
00:26:00,597 --> 00:26:03,101
<i>I'll repeat that for you -
don't use the lifts.</i>

316
00:26:03,221 --> 00:26:04,671
Yeah, fine. Whatever.

317
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,480
12 flights in heels? Men!

318
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:26,520
Cutter?

319
00:27:32,546 --> 00:27:33,555
Cutter?

320
00:27:40,783 --> 00:27:41,698
Great.

321
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,880
The next time I say take the stairs,
you take the stairs!

322
00:28:14,049 --> 00:28:15,235
Watch...

323
00:28:15,355 --> 00:28:18,280
where you're swinging that thing!

324
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:22,560
Next time I'll leave it to you
to get yourself out of trouble.

325
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,495
Fine.
It's not as if I was asking for help.

326
00:28:25,615 --> 00:28:27,600
You were doing so well on your own.

327
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
Everything was fine until you showed up!

328
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:45,494
Are you all right?

329
00:28:47,503 --> 00:28:48,698
It's all true.

330
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,518
Creatures...

331
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,228
Dinosaurs!

332
00:28:54,704 --> 00:28:56,200
This is my new job.

333
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,120
How?

334
00:28:57,491 --> 00:28:59,911
I'll explain everything I know,
but right now I have work to do.

335
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:02,480
If you can't handle it you'd best
go back downstairs right now.

336
00:29:03,906 --> 00:29:05,032
You took your time.

337
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,160
Ever been to a garden centre
on Friday afternoon?

338
00:29:07,321 --> 00:29:09,458
- It's a mad house.
- Leaf blowers. A good idea.

339
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:11,214
Where's Stephen?

340
00:29:11,634 --> 00:29:12,858
We got separated.

341
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,120
<i>An impressive presentation,
Miss Mitchell.</i>

342
00:30:08,613 --> 00:30:13,208
<i>I believe Nagata Beer and your
company can work together.</i>

343
00:30:13,328 --> 00:30:14,600
<i>Congratulations.</i>

344
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,720
Thank you, Mr Nagata.
Can I call you back?

345
00:30:17,237 --> 00:30:18,040
Look!

346
00:30:28,115 --> 00:30:29,040
Go ahead.

347
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,140
Follow me.

348
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,967
Whatever you do, stay out of the fog.

349
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:39,844
- What are those things?
- They're worms.

350
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:42,763
 They're just a little less
friendly than the ones in your garden.

351
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,760
Come on.

352
00:31:03,418 --> 00:31:04,791
I think we're all right now.

353
00:31:26,913 --> 00:31:27,922
You're all right.

354
00:31:30,658 --> 00:31:31,738
Yeah.

355
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:35,479
I've never been swallowed
by a giant worm before, but...

356
00:31:36,096 --> 00:31:37,880
it's all a learning experience.

357
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,280
It could have been worse.

358
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,800
It could have been a lot worse.

359
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,554
- Are you OK?
- Fine.

360
00:31:57,188 --> 00:31:58,570
Who are you people?

361
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:01,925
What happened up there?!

362
00:32:03,894 --> 00:32:06,061
I'm sorry.
I wouldn't know where to start.

363
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,800
Listen - there was a fire,
you heard the alarm.

364
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,400
You tried to evacuate,
but you got lost in the smoke.

365
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,360
- What about those things?
- What things?

366
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,680
They killed Terry.

367
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,480
If I were you I'd think really

368
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,720
hard about how a story like
that's gonna sound out there.

369
00:32:23,258 --> 00:32:24,855
Just call it our little secret.

370
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,581
Caroline's number!

371
00:32:45,904 --> 00:32:46,763
Why?

372
00:32:48,753 --> 00:32:50,874
We've got to find
Stephen and get him out.

373
00:32:50,994 --> 00:32:52,417
Right. How do we do that?

374
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:55,520
The fog's coming from
the anomaly on the 15th floor.

375
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,412
The worms can't breathe outside the fog.

376
00:32:58,841 --> 00:33:00,332
So we have to get rid of the fog?

377
00:33:00,452 --> 00:33:01,871
Can't we just open the windows?

378
00:33:01,991 --> 00:33:03,470
None of the windows open because

379
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,440
the entire building
is temperature-controlled.

380
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,511
Progress.

381
00:33:06,894 --> 00:33:08,480
- What's the point?
- What do we do?

382
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,875
Temperature controlled?

383
00:33:09,995 --> 00:33:11,304
- Air conditioning?
- Yeah.

384
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,240
All we need to do is heat up the air,

385
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:17,566
and it'll expand, and push the fog right
out through the ventilation system.

386
00:33:17,686 --> 00:33:21,000
Unfortunately, the temperature is
controlled from the server room on -

387
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,120
- The 15th floor.
- Of course it is.

388
00:33:25,132 --> 00:33:26,720
It's gonna get seriously hot in here.

389
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,692
- We're going up there, aren't we?
- No.

390
00:33:28,812 --> 00:33:30,960
You're going up there.
I'm gonna look for Stephen.

391
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:38,546
Let me help. I want to do something.

392
00:33:39,456 --> 00:33:40,459
OK.

393
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:43,576
I want you to go and bully
a few traumatised bystanders,

394
00:33:43,696 --> 00:33:46,880
and then I want you to come up with
some spin to just smooth all this away.

395
00:33:47,607 --> 00:33:49,186
You don't approve of me, do you?

396
00:33:49,306 --> 00:33:51,205
I used to think
you were really something.

397
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:53,744
But you're not that person.

398
00:33:54,678 --> 00:33:57,304
- Am I supposed to understand that?
- No, I guess not.

399
00:34:28,698 --> 00:34:29,800
Cutter, hi.

400
00:34:30,351 --> 00:34:31,996
I'm on the 13th floor,

401
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:34,049
don't know exactly where.

402
00:34:34,169 --> 00:34:35,800
<i>What are you waiting for? Come down.</i>

403
00:34:36,628 --> 00:34:38,000
A bit of a problem with that.

404
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:40,728
Leave it with me.

405
00:34:56,943 --> 00:34:58,167
It's hard work this.

406
00:34:58,877 --> 00:35:00,251
I need to go back to the gym.

407
00:35:04,033 --> 00:35:05,960
I can't believe I washed
aroline's number off.

408
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,293
- Such an idiot.
- I know. Shame.

409
00:35:10,915 --> 00:35:13,036
She's gonna think
I'm too cool to call now.

410
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,054
Maybe you'll bump into her again, yeah?

411
00:35:17,256 --> 00:35:19,330
When was I ever that lucky, eh?

412
00:35:20,255 --> 00:35:21,105
You first.

413
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,840
Foggy?

414
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,171
Bit foggy, yeah.

415
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,059
I think we're gonna have
to find another way in.

416
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:44,040
- It's clear.
- All right.

417
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,680
I think we're gonna have to get
by without it. Not enough space.

418
00:35:56,756 --> 00:35:58,821
Can you not crowd me so much?

419
00:35:59,522 --> 00:36:00,960
Little bit of space?
This is...

420
00:36:07,927 --> 00:36:10,098
The server room should be just up here,
and to the left.

421
00:36:12,146 --> 00:36:13,585
That might be the right...

422
00:36:16,423 --> 00:36:17,563
Give it here!

423
00:36:22,551 --> 00:36:24,541
It's that way. The left.

424
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,400
- Really?
- Whoever said men could read maps?

425
00:36:28,552 --> 00:36:29,729
I'm impressed.

426
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:33,280
After everything's Steven's done you're
still willing to risk your life for him.

427
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,417
Meaning what?

428
00:36:34,537 --> 00:36:37,584
Lester asked me to assess
everything that might interfere with

429
00:36:37,704 --> 00:36:38,935
the team's efficiency.

430
00:36:39,055 --> 00:36:41,629
I thought Steven's affair with
Helen would've come into that category.

431
00:36:41,749 --> 00:36:44,240
So, he's sent you here to spy on us?

432
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,256
I prefer to call
it management appraisal.

433
00:36:46,376 --> 00:36:48,412
I should leave him
upthere to die because 

434
00:36:48,532 --> 00:36:50,080
of what happened with him and Helen?

435
00:36:50,481 --> 00:36:52,593
- Some people would.
- I'm not one of them.

436
00:36:53,656 --> 00:36:57,187
Whatever problems I've got with Stephen,
I can sort it out for myself.

437
00:36:57,962 --> 00:36:59,634
<i>077967...</i>

438
00:36:59,905 --> 00:37:01,699
<i>0778967...</i>

439
00:37:01,895 --> 00:37:02,951
What are you doing?

440
00:37:03,071 --> 00:37:05,322
Trying to remember Caroline's number.
Don't put me off.

441
00:37:05,442 --> 00:37:07,031
<i>077896...</i>

442
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,480
Cutter, you're the team leader.
We can't afford to lose you.

443
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,910
The most sensible thing would
be to let Steven fend for himself.

444
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,710
Yeah.

445
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:23,140
Yeah.

446
00:37:23,765 --> 00:37:24,841
You're right.

447
00:37:27,185 --> 00:37:28,409
Now, are you coming?

448
00:37:29,007 --> 00:37:31,110
Are you gonna stay down here,
and be sensible?

449
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,617
I think it's that one
that's the air con.

450
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,880
That's enough. Come back.

451
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,329
Worm.

452
00:38:32,118 --> 00:38:33,200
Nice move.

453
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,440
In your own time.

454
00:38:34,965 --> 00:38:35,840
Sorry.

455
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,295
I can't breathe, Abby.

456
00:38:56,372 --> 00:38:57,715
Is it working?

457
00:38:59,465 --> 00:39:00,726
I hope so.

458
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,120
- You took your time.
- Well, you will run off on your own.

459
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,440
The fog's lifting.

460
00:39:21,768 --> 00:39:22,889
It's working.

461
00:39:32,677 --> 00:39:34,405
What's happening to them?

462
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:38,080
Must be the heat.

463
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,537
They're expanding.

464
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,000
They're spawning.

465
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,880
They're not biting. They're burrowing.

466
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,080
They're trying to find a new host.
Don't let them break the skin.

467
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:14,760
We've got to find something
to bring the temperature down.

468
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,322
It'll take too long.

469
00:40:16,787 --> 00:40:18,130
Anybody got a light?

470
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,040
- Claudia, are you all right?
- Don't call me Claudia!

471
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,687
And I'm fine.

472
00:41:02,926 --> 00:41:04,502
Do you ever wonder...

473
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,159
if what we're doing is right?

474
00:41:08,689 --> 00:41:09,755
Maybe

475
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:12,762
the anomalies have a purpose.
Maybe we should stop fighting,

476
00:41:12,882 --> 00:41:15,404
and face them.

477
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,280
Just stand back and do nothing?

478
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:22,594
People should know what's happening.

479
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:27,178
Cos we're gonna need to
prepare for whatever comes next.

480
00:41:28,702 --> 00:41:33,000
How do you prepare for a world
where evolution is going mad?

481
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:37,978
We have to fight to try and
maintain some kind of natural order.

482
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,664
Does anybody really know
what the natural order is anymore?

483
00:42:08,808 --> 00:42:09,844
Helen?

484
00:42:13,612 --> 00:42:15,160
Like a cup of tea?

485
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,437
Here we are.

486
00:42:20,135 --> 00:42:22,850
I just wanna say I think
you did really well today.

487
00:42:23,288 --> 00:42:25,240
I think you did really well too.

488
00:42:25,682 --> 00:42:27,069
You did good.

489
00:42:27,522 --> 00:42:29,274
- High-five to us.
- Yeah.

490
00:42:30,186 --> 00:42:31,320
Hello?

491
00:42:32,668 --> 00:42:36,440
The door was open.
I think I left my mobile here earlier.

492
00:42:41,382 --> 00:42:42,810
That's a relief.

493
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:45,266
I've been looking for it all day.

494
00:42:47,018 --> 00:42:48,740
I wouldn't wanna miss your call.

495
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:53,577
That's weird, cos all day
I've been fretting about...

496
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:55,560
It doesn't even matter.
Do you fancy a drink?

497
00:42:56,428 --> 00:43:00,107
Like not a cup of tea, obviously.
A proper drink. Somewhere out there.

498
00:43:00,227 --> 00:43:01,246
Why not?

499
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,400
- Now?
- Now.

500
00:43:04,253 --> 00:43:05,520
Super-cool.

501
00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:11,520
- Oh, why don't you join us, Abby?
- Me?

502
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,000
Um, no, I'm fine.

503
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,000
OK, here's the thing.

504
00:43:56,996 --> 00:44:00,835
Suppose there was another world once,

505
00:44:01,283 --> 00:44:03,520
and you were a different person.

506
00:44:04,465 --> 00:44:07,440
And suppose there was an
accident that happened in the past

507
00:44:08,042 --> 00:44:09,680
which meant that world...

508
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,849
evolved differently...

509
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,280
so that some people who had lived

510
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,572
were never even born,

511
00:44:17,692 --> 00:44:19,280
and other people

512
00:44:19,718 --> 00:44:22,360
grew up with completely different lives.

513
00:44:24,273 --> 00:44:25,040
Now,

514
00:44:25,568 --> 00:44:27,080
what if all that were possible?

515
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,360
Who is it, Jen?

516
00:44:31,504 --> 00:44:33,708
You're busy. I'm so sorry.

517
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:35,343
Who's that?

518
00:44:36,891 --> 00:44:38,496
Just someone I work with.
