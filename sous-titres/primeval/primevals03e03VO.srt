1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,260
Go!

2
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,940
Not bad.

3
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,340
You, come with me.

4
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,700
Now jump.

5
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,660
Listen to my voice.

6
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,140
I said...jump.

7
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,660
Death means nothing to you, does it?

8
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,660
You're lucky.

9
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,060
I've always liked modern art.
So uncompromising.

10
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,820
It's a very complex model
of the exact locations -

11
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,340
Of anomaly appearances
throughout recorded history. I know.

12
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,380
Don't touch it.

13
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,900
Ah. Any news of Helen Cutter?

14
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,940
I've started a review of security.

15
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,740
You're sure the intruder
was her doing?

16
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,660
Can anybody else create
an exact replica of a dead man?

17
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,340
Keep everyone on high alert.

18
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,620
If Helen's back,
we should all be very worried.

19
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,060
Mick, I am running out of patience.

20
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,980
I'm this close, Katherine.

21
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,580
I just need something
that nobody could fake.

22
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,020
I can't run a worldwide media story
based on pure speculation.

23
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,740
You do it all the time.

24
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,820
The mammoth on the M25
didn't come to much.

25
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,060
We can say what we like about
footballers and politicians.

26
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,260
But dinosaurs are different.

27
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,060
No-one believes they exist in the
21st century. I don't believe it.

28
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,100
Let me convince you.
One week.

29
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,740
If you've no hard evidence,
clear your desk.

30
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,780
Right.

31
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,260
Miss Lewis...
I just need five minutes.

32
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,540
How did you find out where I live?

33
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,580
Tell me about the ARC and I'll go.

34
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,140
What are you talking about?

35
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,540
The creatures.

36
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,140
Haven't you got a drunken pop star
to harass?

37
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,420
I'm giving you a chance to comment
before I write the story.

38
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,940
Go into print and you'll be
laughed out of town.

39
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,940
Not if I er...have the proof.

40
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,220
But you don't. And you never will.

41
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,180
This is the biggest cover-up
since Roswell.

42
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,980
I'm going to tear the lid off it.

43
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,780
Come near me again
and I'll have you arrested.

44
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,060
So, this contraption is going to seal
the anomalies, is it?

45
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,540
in theory.

46
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,860
Yeah.

47
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,660
You want a million pounds for
research and development.

48
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,980
I want something more
than theoretical.

49
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,900
You'll get it. In simple terms,
this machine will reverse
the polarity of the anomalies,

50
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,180
so nothing gets in
and nothing gets out.

51
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,140
James...

52
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,340
Are you sure about this?

53
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,500
Pretty sure.

54
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,340
OK. It's in the city.

55
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,500
It's a hospital.

56
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,140
The new anomaly. Perfect.

57
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,420
Get rid of him.
We've got important things to do.

58
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,820
Becker, take your men.
Look for any creature activity.

59
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,620
Come on.

60
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,660
Power cut.

61
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,900
The back-up generator
should kick in now.

62
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,420
I'm having a baby.
When?

63
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,420
Now.

64
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,060
It's come right through the floor.

65
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,020
So...so, if you walked through,

66
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,180
would you keep on falling?

67
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,300
I don't know.

68
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,620
But the anomaly itself wouldn't be
enough to cause a power outage,
so something's come through it.

69
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,380
Abby.

70
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,900
Teeth marks.

71
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,620
Hyperactive mice?

72
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,140
Your Gran embroidered this blanket
for you.

73
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,980
You'll like her. She's...

74
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,980
she's a smart woman,
but she's wrong about your daddy.

75
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,940
He's a good guy, he just...

76
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,340
just needs a little bit of time,
that's all.

77
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,820
It went through a hole in the wall
there.

78
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,340
What did?
I don't know.

79
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,980
A ratty, chipmunk,
beaver kind of thing.

80
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,380
Well, that narrows it down.

81
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,860
Cutter.

82
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,820
We might have a problem.

83
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,340
A...ratty, chipmunk...

84
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,380
Beaver.

85
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,500
..beaver kind of problem.

86
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,180
How did she describe this creature,
apart from the ratty,
chipmunk thing?

87
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,100
Right. Er...about so big.

88
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,980
Protruding teeth, large,
and some claws.

89
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,300
We've had three other
reported sightings.

90
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,980
We've got dozens of them in here.

91
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,500
I need you both to get this place
evacuated now.

92
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,540
Hi. Er...we have to evacuate
the building.

93
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,100
Sarah, if you see this man
within a mile of the ARC,
you've got to let me know.

94
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,220
Why?

95
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,260
He thinks he knows something.

96
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,620
And does he?

97
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,620
Rather a lot, unfortunately.

98
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,140
What do you think about Cutter?

99
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,580
Erm...Cutter?

100
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,980
I think he's a great guy.

101
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,220
Oh. You mean, what do I think?

102
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,660
Cutter.

103
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,740
OK. I think that he is...

104
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,700
pretty hot,

105
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,340
in an emotionally toxic,

106
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,780
don't-come-near-me,
I'm-a-romantic-disaster kind of way.

107
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,380
Just my type, then.

108
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,100
Is there something going on
between you two?

109
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,860
It's complicated.

110
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,260
Apparently, he used to like
some girl that looked like me.

111
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,260
According to him, actually was me,

112
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,660
in a different evolutionary
timeline.

113
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,300
So, now I don't know if he likes her
or me or the version of her in me,

114
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,220
or whether
it's just the same thing.

115
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,860
No baggage, then?

116
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:13,740
They're on red alert. Infiltration
is impossible without security
clearance and retina scanners.

117
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,700
That depends on who you know.

118
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,520
What?

119
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
What is it?

120
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,400
A diictodon.

121
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,120
Male.

122
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,440
Permian era.

123
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,160
Herbivores and burrowers.

124
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,080
Chew their way through anything.

125
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,440
You are an electrician's nightmare.

126
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,600
Come on. That's cute.

127
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,760
Yeah, I mean,
they're social creatures.

128
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,640
Wait. Stay.

129
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,960
Wait.

130
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,760
And quick, too.

131
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,920
Yes.

132
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,680
Let go. Get off it!

133
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,520
You can't have that. It's mine!

134
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,120
Open the door!

135
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,040
"Final call for everyone
to evacuate the building."

136
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,200
Anything?

137
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,320
No.
"Proceed to your nearest exit."

138
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,400
Cutter?

139
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,840
We're trapped in the operating
theatre with the anomaly and...

140
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,640
a woman who's about to give birth.
I need you here as quick as you can.

141
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,960
"We're on our way."

142
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,520
Where are the theatres?

143
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,960
No idea.
Let's find someone who works here.

144
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,240
I'm a trained soldier.
I can find my way around a hospital.

145
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,800
That's it, little fellow. You're
my ticket to the big time.

146
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,880
Just hold it right there.

147
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,960
No!

148
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,160
What are you doing here?

149
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,240
I work here.

150
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,200
Yes, but what are you doing here now?

151
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,720
I work here.

152
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,360
Are you feeling all right?

153
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,400
Yes.

154
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,480
You don't seem quite yourself.

155
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,960
I'm Professor Nick Cutter.

156
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,080
Strangely enough,
I hadn't actually forgotten that.

157
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,640
Cutter.

158
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,760
You're back. Great.

159
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,920
Erm...I've verified another date,

160
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,240
so I need you to check it
before I add it to the model. Yeah?

161
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,920
Memo to self. Arrange regular mental
health check-ups for all staff.

162
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,560
What is that thing?

163
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,000
The power cuts have caused
a temporary atmospheric overload.

164
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,240
It's kind of like a hurricane,

165
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,680
only made up of electricity.

166
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,320
Do I look daft?

167
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,960
Oh, I think this is it.

168
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,480
No, you're not having a baby now.

169
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,520
Yeah. Right now.

170
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,560
How difficult can it be to find
an operating theatre in a hospital?

171
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,920
What was that
about being a trained soldier?

172
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,880
Catch it.

173
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,480
What do you mean, catch it?

174
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,680
Catch it!

175
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,160
All right.

176
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,360
OK. Catch it. Get under it.

177
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,760
This.

178
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,800
Maybe we could.

179
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,280
Hello, mate.

180
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,040
My name's Connor. This is...

181
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,960
My name's Connor. How are you?

182
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,880
If I'm not mistaken,
you're a diictodon, right?

183
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,240
Cutter.

184
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,320
This woman is a trained
health professional.

185
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,160
She doesn't look like a nurse.

186
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,760
She's a zookeeper.

187
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,480
What?

188
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,200
How many babies have you delivered?
Dozens.

189
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,400
What kind of babies?

190
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,400
Zebras,

191
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,480
lions,

192
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,680
antelopes...

193
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,240
I delivered a giraffe once.

194
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,560
So, don't worry. The principle
is the same, only hopefully your
baby will have a shorter neck.

195
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,480
I need you to take a look
at these calculations,

196
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,120
but I think that they're as accurate
as possible.

197
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,320
I'm busy now.

198
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,240
You carry on with your work.

199
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,600
I'm trying.

200
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,360
If we feed these figures into
the model, I think -

201
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,320
Be quiet.

202
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,840
Hello.

203
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,960
You've changed. Your clothes.
You weren't wearing that before.

204
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,320
Did something happen
at the hospital?

205
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,200
Yes.

206
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,880
If you're busy right now,
it's not a problem.

207
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,760
I've got things to do too.

208
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,560
I'm leaving now.

209
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,720
You're going back to the hospital?
Yes.

210
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,360
Don't let me hold you up.

211
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,760
Cutter?

212
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,080
Do you remember that drink
we talked about?

213
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,440
How about tonight?

214
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,760
I'm leaving now.

215
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,920
Yeah, I got that.

216
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,320
OK. Bad idea. Forget it.
Maybe another time.

217
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,240
No. There won't be another time.

218
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,440
OK.

219
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,920
Fair enough.

220
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,160
I can handle that.

221
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,120
I appreciate your honesty.

222
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,160
I think.

223
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,840
I'm an idiot.

224
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,280
I'm...an idiot.

225
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,760
I didn't want it to be like this!

226
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,840
I wanted it to be beautiful.

227
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,680
Breathe.
It hurts!

228
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,280
You'll get through this.
You'll soon have a beautiful baby.

229
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,720
It's a girl.

230
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,840
A girl. Ahh! Don't actually
think I'd want to know, but -

231
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,880
I just know it will be.

232
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,480
What's your name?

233
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,520
Nick.

234
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,960
You're a nice man.

235
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,240
Sometimes.

236
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,680
Abby.

237
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,600
What are you waiting for?

238
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,280
It's a distress call.

239
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,720
It's all right.

240
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,280
Just a hunch.
Maybe it'll attract the others.

241
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,960
It's all right.

242
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,360
They're not here.

243
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,160
What is it, mate?

244
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,640
Hey? What are you trying to tell me?

245
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,760
Oh, fantastic.
Now he's Dr Doolittle.

246
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,840
He wasn't making that noise before.

247
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,800
Can you hear that?

248
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,040
Follow me.

249
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,360
Oh, God!

250
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,200
Abby, you're needed here.

251
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,400
It's coming!

252
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,440
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

253
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,480
All right. All right. Push.

254
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,280
Oh, God!

255
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,320
I'm not sure this is working, Abby.

256
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,520
It's coming.

257
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,800
That's it.

258
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,880
Ha! It worked.

259
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,880
The distress call attracts them.

260
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,160
What's going on?

261
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,520
It's just the drugs.
I haven't had any drugs.

262
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,520
Go on, go on, go on, go on.

263
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,640
What are we going to do about her?

264
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,760
I don't know.

265
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,240
She's stuck here now.

266
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,040
Because I'm having a baby!

267
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,160
Sorry.

268
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,920
All right. OK. One last push.

269
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,840
Listen to my voice.

270
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,200
"Open the main security gate."

271
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,000
You wanted to see me?

272
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,960
Take a seat.

273
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,640
Have you noticed anything...

274
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,440
..strange about Cutter recently?

275
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,480
How long have you got?

276
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,520
Stranger than normal, I mean.

277
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,600
Well he's not saying much,

278
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,400
and he's suddenly decided to change
his clothes twice today, so...

279
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,680
I'm worried he might be erm...

280
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,760
..unravelling.

281
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,480
I hear you've been looking for me.

282
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,080
Thought I'd save you the trouble.

283
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,280
Get off me!

284
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,280
You should be more careful, Dr Page.

285
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,200
Cutter!

286
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,480
What the hell is going on?

287
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,560
You are so fired.

288
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,040
Don't kill him yet.

289
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,000
Yet?

290
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,640
What have you done?

291
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,800
Guard this door.

292
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,840
Shoot anyone
who tries to get in or out.

293
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,640
Obey no-one else.

294
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,920
My voice is the only voice
you recognise.

295
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,040
So, Cutter's finally gone native.

296
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,320
He would never betray us.

297
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,480
Unless I'm very much mistaken,
he just did.

298
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,160
I know him. And I know he wouldn't
do this of his own free will.

299
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,720
Excellent. No signal.

300
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,000
Did you see the way
she spoke to him?

301
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,280
It was...

302
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,040
pretty weird.

303
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,920
She's beautiful.

304
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,000
It's a boy.

305
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,200
A boy?

306
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,560
Hello, you.

307
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,920
Sorry, we...

308
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,440
(OK. I'm going to have to go.

309
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,920
The nurse will look after you now.
OK?)

310
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,040
Thank you, for everything.

311
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,280
Do you know
what you're going to call him?

312
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,200
I don't know.

313
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,200
I only had girls' names ready.

314
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,360
Do you think erm...

315
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,440
Do you think he'd be OK
if I called him erm...

316
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,480
... Stanley?

317
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,040
I know it's old-fashioned.
It was my dad's name.

318
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,480
See you around, Stanley.

319
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,560
So, who locked you in?

320
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
I don't know.

321
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,200
Yeah.

322
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,960
Looks like they missed
the last bus home.

323
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,640
What shall we do with them?

324
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,680
We keep 'em.

325
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,240
Yeah.

326
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,200
For now.

327
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,560
Come on, guys.

328
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,400
You asked for evidence.

329
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,200
Brilliant.
Tell them to hold the front page.

330
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,320
Really?

331
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,280
No. Not really. You bring me a blurry
photo of a gopher with comedy plastic
teeth and you call this evidence?

332
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,320
A child of ten could have faked that.

333
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320
This is a prehistoric creature!

334
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,240
Get out of my sight.

335
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,920
Give me one last chance.
Why?

336
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,400
Because it's the biggest story
in history.

337
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,280
Do you really want it to go to
one of your competitors?

338
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,280
It's brilliant, Nick.

339
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,840
Beautiful.

340
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,320
We should have worked on it
together.

341
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,480
What am I talking to you for?

342
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,480
It's as if he had no will
of his own. He just responded
to everything she told him.

343
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,600
You're right. Like he was programmed
to obey her voice.

344
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,880
Exactly.

345
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,040
He didn't even seem to hear
the rest of us.

346
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,000
So, what we have to do...

347
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,120
is get her to change
her instructions.

348
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,360
Why would she do that?

349
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,040
Maybe we can do it for her.

350
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,360
Are you all right in there, guys?
Comfy?

351
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,800
He should have checked our passes.

352
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,800
Yeah. Your men are getting slack.

353
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,920
You go on ahead. I want to have
a little word with security.

354
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,960
Something's not right.

355
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,920
Where is everyone?

356
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,760
It's...it's you.

357
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,280
Put Connor and Abby with the others.

358
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,200
"Is there anything in my voice,
Lester,

359
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,280
anything at all,

360
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,920
that's telling you there's nothing
you can do to make me obey you?

361
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,280
Nothing will stop me doing
what I have to do.

362
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,080
Nothing will stop me...

363
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,480
I just need to paste this
into a new file.

364
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,320
"Stop. Do nothing. Obey my voice."

365
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,920
"Stop. Do nothing. Obey my voice."

366
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,760
What is going on?

367
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,920
I was just about to
ask you the same question.
What the hell's got into Cutter?

368
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,280
That's not him.

369
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,800
There's two of him.

370
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,040
Two versions of Cutter.
What a nightmare.

371
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,880
We've got to do something.

372
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,920
Connor, er...

373
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,520
we have to play this audio file

374
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,480
over the internal sound system.

375
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,120
We can't do that from here.

376
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,320
You created this.

377
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,720
I er...

378
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,960
borrowed the technology
from the future.

379
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,680
It's made from your DNA.

380
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,960
Perfect in every physical detail.

381
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,360
Physical.

382
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
It has er...

383
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,080
limited intelligence.

384
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,480
Enough to follow basic instruction.

385
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,000
It's a human being, though?

386
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,040
Free will is what makes us human.

387
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,120
This...

388
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,240
creature has er...

389
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,920
It's nothing more
than a living photocopy.

390
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,720
Please tell me
you didn't do this to Stephen.

391
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,280
No matter what they look like,
they can never be the original.

392
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,480
Why are you doing this, Helen?

393
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,040
Because I have seen
the final destruction

394
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,560
of almost every living creature
on this once-beautiful planet.

395
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,120
I can stop it, Nick.

396
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,680
I can save us from that.

397
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,320
Whatever's going to happen
is going to happen.

398
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,240
We must leave it alone.
Look what happened last time.

399
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,000
You killed Stephen.

400
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,040
I didn't kill Stephen.

401
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,200
You did.

402
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,040
The course of evolution
can be changed.

403
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,080
I can...

404
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,720
restore balance.

405
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,560
You still don't get it, do you?

406
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,760
No matter how many times
you interfere,

407
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,720
you can't get the result you want,

408
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,200
because evolution can't be bent
to your will.

409
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,200
I really hope you're wrong.

410
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,760
Everyone er...OK?

411
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,640
Helen's taken over the ARC.

412
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,320
I know. Her men are crawling
all over the place.

413
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,240
How many men have you got?
Just me. Should be enough.

414
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,560
Becker, we need to get this
to the PA system.

415
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,280
What is it? Doesn't matter.

416
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,400
Come with me.
The rest of you stay here.

417
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,600
You see, you don't know it yet,

418
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,720
but I do.

419
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,800
Know what?

420
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,760
Your work will lead to
predators being created
here in this ARC of yours.

421
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,280
I'd never sanction that.

422
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,320
I've seen them...in the future.

423
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,640
Troops from the ARC.

424
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,120
No. You've got it wrong.

425
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,080
You haven't done it yet.
But sooner or later you will.

426
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,120
And it has to be stopped. You.

427
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
You have to be stopped now.

428
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,320
Before it begins.

429
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,360
If you're so sure of this,

430
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,760
then why didn't you get your...

431
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,720
creature to kill me
when he had the chance?

432
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,160
Why don't you just shoot me now?

433
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,680
Because there is something

434
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,840
I still don't understand.

435
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,560
Tell me what this is.

436
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,120
Well?

437
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,120
Do you know or not, Professor?

438
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,920
Of course I do.

439
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,400
Tell me.

440
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,360
No.

441
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,160
You can go to hell.

442
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,320
Give him ten seconds, then shoot him.

443
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,600
All right?

444
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,880
I can't...

445
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,840
Come on, Temple. Hurry up!

446
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
Quick.

447
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,280
One.

448
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,760
Two.

449
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,840
Don't do it.

450
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,960
Three.

451
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,440
You can't appeal
to his finer feelings.

452
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,800
Five. Six.
Tell me what this is.

453
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,520
You don't have to do as she says.
Seven.

454
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,880
You have a choice.

455
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,000
Eight.
OK.

456
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,200
Nine.

457
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,640
OK.

458
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,760
I'll tell you.

459
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,640
Put the gun down.

460
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,400
Do you think they made it?

461
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,200
We'll soon find out.

462
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,200
Get off!

463
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,200
Get off!

464
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,440
Abby!

465
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,440
Argh! Argh!

466
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,200
My fingers!

467
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,600
I can handle this, Temple.

468
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,120
I can't.

469
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,480
I can't reach.

470
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,080
Punch him!

471
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,200
"Do nothing. Obey my voice."

472
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,280
"Stop. Do nothing. Obey my voice."

473
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,280
"Stop. Do nothing."

474
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,920
No! Stop! That's not me!

475
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,000
"Stop. Do nothing. Obey my voice."

476
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,560
Stop! That's not me! That's not me!

477
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,000
"Obey my voice."

478
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,080
"Stop. Do nothing. Obey my voice."

479
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,880
"Stop. Do nothing. Obey my voice."

480
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,960
They did it.

481
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,280
"Stop. Do nothing. Obey my voice."

482
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,120
"Obey my voice."

483
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,760
Insurance.

484
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,280
"Obey my voice."

485
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,480
It's over.

486
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,480
"Stop. Do nothing. Obey my voice."

487
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,480
Listen to my voice.

488
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,160
Complete your mission.

489
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,440
"Stop. Do nothing. Obey my voice."

490
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,920
"Stop. Do nothing. Obey my voice."

491
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,640
Look, I know that you can hear me.

492
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,800
I know you can understand.

493
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,640
You don't have to obey her.

494
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,560
She made me.

495
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,200
You're a human being.
You have a choice.

496
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,040
Don't listen to him.
Follow your instructions.

497
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,480
You're not a machine.

498
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,600
You're a free man.

499
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,280
You don't want to die.

500
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,920
I don't know what death is.

501
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,560
Trust me,

502
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,240
life's better.

503
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,960
Don't listen to him!

504
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,440
Save yourself.

505
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,980
Guys! Come on.

506
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,940
Come on. Everyone out.

507
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,780
Now!

508
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,620
Cutter?

509
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,780
He's in here!

510
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,580
Cutter.

511
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,580
We've got to get out of here now.

512
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,740
Connor?
Are you OK?

513
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,420
Abby?

514
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,780
What's going on?

515
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,300
It's some sort of bomb.

516
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:58,140
Right, we've got to prioritise
the casualties.

517
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,460
Where's Helen?

518
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,980
She must be still inside.

519
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,420
Nick.

520
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,180
She wouldn't lift a finger
to save you.

521
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,020
Yeah, I know.

522
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,540
Don't go.

523
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,020
This is a mistake.

524
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,140
I'll be fine.

525
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,740
Cutter!

526
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,260
Where the hell's he going?

527
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,100
Cutter!

528
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,820
Helen.

529
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,660
You came back for me?

530
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,940
Yeah.

531
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,940
You always were sentimental.

532
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,420
Where's the artefact?

533
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,140
It'll be wherever you left it.

534
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,180
What does it do, Nick?

535
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,260
Why is it so important?

536
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,860
I have no idea.
Now, are you coming or aren't you?

537
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,580
I'm sorry, Nick. I can't let you go.

538
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,900
What the hell
are you talking about now?

539
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,900
Oh, for God's sake.

540
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,140
You see, nothing's changed, Nick.

541
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,020
The future is more important
than either of us.

542
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,660
You really know how to pick
your moments.

543
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,420
If you'd seen what I'd seen,
you'd understand.

544
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,980
I'm sorry, Nick.

545
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,700
I wish there was another way.

546
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,420
Know what, Helen?

547
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,540
You're not as smart
as I thought you were.

548
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,300
Get round back there.

549
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,260
Fast!

550
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,060
He's been gone too long.

551
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,340
Be careful.

552
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,020
Connor! Connor!

553
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,580
Connor.

554
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,660
Good man.

555
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,900
You hold on.
I'm going to take you out.

556
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,100
Sorry.
Don't.

557
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,300
Don't...do that.

558
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,860
Sorry.

559
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,620
It's OK.

560
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,580
Just sit with me.

561
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,660
All right?

562
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,620
OK.

563
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,220
This...

564
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,780
This matters.

565
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,300
I don't know why.

566
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,420
But it does, so...

567
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,340
You have to find out what it means,
OK?

568
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,300
OK.

569
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,900
It's on you now.

570
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,940
No.

571
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,860
No.

572
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:49,260
We can do this together.
We've always done it together.

573
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,220
No.

574
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,180
Not this time.

575
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,900
Tell...

576
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,260
Tell Claudia Brown...

577
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,660
Never mind.

578
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,140
It doesn't matter.

579
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,260
Get an ambulance. Quickly.

580
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,700
Nick.

581
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,180
It's too late.

582
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,580
What?

583
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,900
He can't be.

584
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,860
Oh, God.

585
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,820
There was something
I had to tell him.

586
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:21,700
I won't let you down, Professor.

587
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,180
We should get this man
in an ambulance now!

588
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,700
Two minutes. I can have this thing
up and running.

589
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,500
It's a velociraptor. A young one.

590
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,180
You need all the help you can get.

591
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,540
Let's turn and burn.
