1
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,430
You're certain it was in the ARC?

2
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,950
We intercepted calls.
The ARC staff were saying

3
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,870
Helen Cutter had it.

4
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,150
So what's happened to it?
We don't know.

5
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,390
It might have been destroyed
in the fire. It might not.

6
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,470
My whole future
could depend on this.

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,710
If it's there, I want it back,
understand?

8
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,790
Ma'am.

9
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,950
Ready to begin?

10
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,870
It's amazing.

11
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,910
Once we understand them,
we'll know how to control them.

12
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,550
Get out of there.

13
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,430
Run! Go, go, go!

14
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,790
Does it know I'm here?
Yes, it can sense your heartbeat.

15
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,030
We have to learn
how to harness that power.

16
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,630
Deal with it. It means temporary
suspension of the cloaking device.

17
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,150
The ARC will know...
I'll deal with them later.

18
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,870
'It's on you now.

19
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,070
This matters.

20
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,870
I don't know why.

21
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,830
But it does.

22
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,070
It's on you now.'

23
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,510
Connor...

24
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,110
Let me help you.

25
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,590
I'm an archaeologist, I know how
to deal with things like this.

26
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,710
I can clean it up and see
what lies beneath the dirt.

27
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,910
Listen to me, nobody can find
out about what we're doing here.

28
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,110
Absolutely. Not until we know
what we're dealing with.

29
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,870
Go.

30
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,310
You're in charge until we can
make a permanent appointment.

31
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,710
Are you sure
you want me to take over?

32
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,550
If I wasn't, I wouldn't ask.

33
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,910
Don't expect a pay rise.

34
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,070
I could probably swing you
a parking space.

35
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,590
Keep things calm, controlled,

36
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,390
and if you can manage it,
slightly dull.

37
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,350
Is it working?
No, not yet.

38
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,830
But it will be.

39
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,510
Excuse me.
You need to get some rest.

40
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,750
What I need to do is finish this
and then...

41
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,070
Then I need to fix the detector.

42
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,830
This is the Anomaly Locking
Mechanism.

43
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,190
If I can...
If I can get this to work Abby,

44
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,270
we can seal anomalies.

45
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,710
If we don't know where they are
then it won't be much use, will it?

46
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,710
Fine.

47
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,350
You're driving them too hard.

48
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,470
Right now,
work is the best thing for us.

49
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,950
Any luck?

50
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,190
It's too soon to say.

51
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,630
Once it's clean, we should have
a better idea.

52
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,550
Any chance of putting this back
together?

53
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,030
Wouldn't know where to start.

54
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,990
Give me a few years, I might
be able to work some of it out.

55
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,150
Cutter kept a lot of things
to himself.

56
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,990
Tell me about it.

57
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,310
Hey Jenny, if you ever need
to talk about anything...

58
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,510
There's nothing to say.

59
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,710
Is this a test?
No, this is genuine.

60
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,430
Do we have a location?
Ah-ha.

61
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,390
I'm getting the co-ordinates now.

62
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,190
OK.

63
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,870
It's a go.

64
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,070
OK, let's go then.

65
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,150
Jenny...

66
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,870
It's...it's nearly ready.
Next time. Let's move.

67
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,390
Ma'am...

68
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,270
The cloaking device is going
back on now.

69
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,390
The ARC will have picked up
the signal. Get your men ready.

70
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,150
In there.

71
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,710
Hello?

72
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,510
It's deserted.

73
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,070
It could be in there somewhere.

74
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,670
There must be another way in.

75
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,150
Wait, Jenny.

76
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,070
Captain Wilder?
Becker.

77
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,030
You two know each other?

78
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,350
Sandhurst. Top of his class,
one of my best cadets.

79
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,870
If you two are going to hug,
can you do it later,

80
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,910
cos there's an anomaly in here.
Move back into the foyer.

81
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,750
What's going on here?

82
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,250
You must be Jenny Lewis.
I'm Christine Johnson.

83
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,730
Nice to meet you.

84
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,010
What is this place?
Jenny...

85
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,850
This definitely detected an anomaly
less than 100 feet away from here.

86
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,770
I know that might not mean
anything to you,

87
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,810
but trust me, not a good thing.

88
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,330
There's really nothing to worry
about. There's no anomaly here.

89
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,650
What do you know about
the anomalies?

90
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,970
Let's just have a look,
you know, just to be sure.

91
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,890
I can assure you
you'd find nothing.

92
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,170
I want unrestricted access to
the whole place and an explanation

93
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,050
of why you're here.
I'm afraid that's not possible.

94
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,290
I can make it happen with one phone
call, so let's save time.

95
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,250
James Lester has no authority here.

96
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,090
Now I suggest you go back
to the ARC

97
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:40,530
and do what it is you all do best.
Did you hear what we just said?

98
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:43,570
You could be in danger,
just let us go in and have a look.

99
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,210
That's very thoughtful,
but we'll be quite safe.

100
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,410
Do give my regards to James.

101
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,530
Captain Becker, isn't it?

102
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,650
I gather you and Captain Wilder
are old colleagues.

103
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:02,490
Yes, Ma'am.
Perhaps you'll have the chance

104
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,450
to work together again some day.

105
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,090
Oh God! The car...

106
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,890
Damn it!

107
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:30,410
She seemed to know all about us
and the anomalies.

108
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,730
That's not news to you, is it?

109
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,490
Are you sure the detector
was working?

110
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,730
We got the same reading
from the handheld.

111
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,730
But you can't be certain?

112
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,290
Well no, but if it wasn't
an anomaly, what was it?

113
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,250
Did you know this place existed?

114
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,610
No.
Right.

115
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:55,250
Then we need to find out
what they're doing there.

116
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,570
Yes! Thank you for that statement
of the blindingly obvious!

117
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,890
Right, yeah, leave it with me.

118
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,050
Go on, thank you.

119
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,130
Abby's phone, hello?
'Is Abby there?'

120
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,650
No, she's, she's not at the minute,
can I take a message?

121
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,490
'Tell her I'm going to show her
a proper good time.'

122
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,930
Excuse me? 'I'm back and we're
going out on the town tonight.'

123
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,930
Who is this?
'Jack.'

124
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,930
Jack who?

125
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,890
'Got to go, mate.'

126
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,490
Hello?

127
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,330
What is it?
Some kind of detector.

128
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,250
For what?
No idea.

129
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,210
Oh, incisive!

130
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:21,530
Well, I'm sure it's something
to do with the creatures.

131
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,810
Mick, you realise you're sounding
a little mad? I know.

132
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,770
I don't employ mad people.
What are you talking about?

133
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:31,650
Half your journalists are mad. They
don't file stories on dinosaurs.

134
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,290
It's beeping, what does that mean?

135
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:37,130
I think it means we're on our way.

136
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,610
Get me a camera crew ready
in two minutes.

137
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,890
Is it the same place?

138
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,850
No. No, this is a new one.

139
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,450
OK, let's get going then.

140
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,490
Where's Abby?

141
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,570
She said she had to meet someone.

142
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,770
Who?
I don't know, Jack somebody.

143
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,730
We'll call her on the way.

144
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,170
Jenny, give me two minutes.

145
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,730
Two minutes I can have this thing
up and running.

146
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,170
Please.

147
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,050
Two minutes.
Yes!

148
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,130
What is it?
I don't know.

149
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,170
But I think we're going
to find out.

150
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,010
Connor, how much longer?

151
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,970
Seconds away.

152
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,010
Done. You can load it up.

153
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,450
This is actually going to work?
It'll work.

154
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,490
I know this is going to work,
it's...

155
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,090
I hope it's going to work.
It's OK, just asking.

156
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,050
Becker, we'll see you there.

157
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,090
OK, so what do you want me to do?

158
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,050
Depends on what happens.

159
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,570
Who do I speak to about my expenses?

160
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,570
What was that?

161
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,250
Where to now?

162
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,210
Straight ahead, about half a mile.

163
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,330
Did she say anything else?
Who?

164
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:07,050
Abby. About this Jack guy
and who he was exactly?

165
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,730
No she didn't. I thought
you were calling her?

166
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,690
I tried calling her, but...

167
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,250
What the hell do you think
you're playing at?! You OK?

168
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,810
Please, you've got to come quickly.
What is it?

169
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,250
There's this thing,
a big shining light.

170
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,370
This creature came through
and it started... Stay there.

171
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,250
How much tranquilliser
do you think we need?

172
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,890
This thing, how big was it?

173
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,770
Big.
Your call.

174
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,730
It's in there. Better hurry,
it's really frightening.

175
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,290
I told you to stay away from this.
I know.

176
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,250
I wish I'd listened to you.

177
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,330
Stay there.

178
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,130
You OK?
I'm fine.

179
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,970
I'll go first.
No, me.

180
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,650
How about we both go together?

181
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,930
OK.
On three?

182
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,090
OK.

183
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,290
One...

184
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,890
Two...

185
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,650
Three.

186
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,410
No! No no no no no...

187
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,890
Open the door!
What do you think you're doing?!

188
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,850
Thanks for the scoop, Jenny!

189
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,210
Damn it!

190
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,490
Great!

191
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,170
Has it done anything else yet?
No.

192
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,330
This better be good.
Well, what about that thing?

193
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,850
You promised me a prehistoric
creature.

194
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,730
Now anything less then a mammoth,
you're fired.

195
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,810
No.

196
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,850
No back door.
Oh God!

197
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,010
I can't believe
I let myself get taken in

198
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:52,250
by that reptile of a journalist!
He's pretty good though.

199
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,970
As reptile journalists go,
he had me.

200
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,130
Becker, how far away are you?

201
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,290
Well look, I don't care how many
barriers you go through

202
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,250
I need you here faster than fast.

203
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,410
They're stuck in road works.

204
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,690
What are you doing?
Door's solid.

205
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,650
We're not getting through there.

206
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,450
This is unbelievable.

207
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,690
Hello there.

208
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,290
Isn't this extraordinary?

209
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,250
Look at this.

210
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,730
What is it? Tell us what it is.

211
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,810
It's a Velociraptor.

212
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,930
A young one, from the late
cretaceous.

213
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:42,210
This little fellow
is about 80 million years old

214
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,210
and when it's full grown,
these are top predators.

215
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,170
It's a little nervous.

216
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,290
Do you know,
if I could pat a dinosaur...

217
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,610
Hello there.
Come on little fellow, come on.

218
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,050
Wow! That was unbelievable!

219
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,090
Somebody pinch me. Huh!

220
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,850
Keep on filming!

221
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,890
Don't you dare run away!

222
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,610
Danny Quinn?
Oh, you don't want to do that.

223
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,210
You need all the help you can get.

224
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,620
It's over there.
What are you doing here?

225
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,780
Saving your bacon. How did
you even know where we were?

226
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,860
I followed the journalist.

227
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,500
You know he broke into your car?
I gathered that.

228
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,380
Thanks for the help but just go now.
But it's just getting interesting.

229
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,860
If you don't go now,
I'll have you arrested.

230
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,900
Guys, as fun as this is,
we've got more pressing matters.

231
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,500
Give me the gun. I'll go in first.
One more step and I will shoot you.

232
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,460
All right. Absolutely.

233
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,900
That is...

234
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,740
It's enormous, isn't it?
Whew!

235
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,580
You're not going, are you?

236
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,620
Help, you've got to get me
out of here, please!

237
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,660
Help!
Hello?

238
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,860
Please get me out. Door's jammed,
get round the other side.

239
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,820
Oi, I give the orders around here.

240
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,780
Connor, round the other side.

241
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,660
OK, keep your head still.

242
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,860
I've got the door open.
Try to stay calm, we'll get
you out as soon as we can.

243
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,860
Just get us out of here, please!

244
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,420
OK, listen, I need you to try
and edge your way towards me.

245
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,300
Yes, that's right, nearly there.

246
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,660
Can I help you?
Get me Christine Johnson.

247
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:25,100
I don't care if she's in a meeting,
on holiday or struck by lightning.
Get her for me now!

248
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,100
Just bring it in here.

249
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,940
Listen, try not to break it
as you unpack it, OK?

250
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,980
Can you describe
the creature to me?

251
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,980
Big.
It's very big, it's huge.

252
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,780
I want more detail.
People are dead because of you.

253
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,900
But this is amazing.

254
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,380
This is the biggest story ever
and it's mine!

255
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,220
You don't seriously believe
you can cover this up?

256
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,300
There'll be no story, trust me.
Guys, can we just focus?

257
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,780
What happened to the creature?
It went back.

258
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:57,220
You can't stop me from telling
the world about this. Watch me.

259
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,740
Take them away, take their phones,
not one word of this leaks out.

260
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,020
This is unbelievable!
We haven't got much time.

261
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,660
It'll be back.
He knows there's easy prey here.

262
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,780
Look, here's what
I think we should do.

263
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,420
There is no 'we'. This has
got nothing to do with you.

264
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,500
This is a secure zone

265
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,220
and you don't have authorisation
to even be here. Leave now!

266
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,380
Do you want me to arrest him?
Last chance.

267
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,540
So...where do you want
all this stuff? Over there?

268
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,660
Unbelievable.

269
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,300
That's the last one.

270
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,620
Nothing here threatens
the integrity of the ARC operation.

271
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,020
I give you my word on that.
And the Minister's.

272
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,980
Do you know, I can't tell you
how much that reassures me.

273
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,940
You've got a little bit
of a hotline

274
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,980
to the Minister, haven't you?

275
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,660
I saw your suggestions
for Cutter's replacement.

276
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,860
One thing in common,
military uniforms.

277
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:58,100
Have you got a little bit
of a thing for them?

278
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,300
We're all on the same side, James.
We have to trust each other.

279
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,700
No, I don't think either of us got
where we are by trusting anyone.

280
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,660
The military have a big role to play
in the fight against the anomalies.

281
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:13,220
I'm sure you appreciate that.
You're getting nowhere near ARC.

282
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,740
You want to trust me on something?
Trust me on that...Christine.

283
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,180
Bear with me.
OK.

284
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,140
And we are ready.

285
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,700
OK. Do this for me.

286
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,820
Connor!

287
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,340
Connor...

288
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,900
I thought you said this was
going to work? It does.

289
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,580
It will. Well, how long
before we can try it again?

290
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,740
I don't know,
a few seconds, I don't know.

291
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,980
It's just a little thing,
but did anyone

292
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,980
think about closing the doors?
That's it, arrest him.

293
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,700
Look out!

294
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,060
Our exclusive is heading
towards the runway.

295
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,020
I need to get out of here.

296
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,220
The biker, he's gone.

297
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,180
His name's Danny Quinn.
I'm more concerned about
a T Rex wild on an airfield.

298
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:52,060
That wasn't a T Rex.
That was a giganotasaurus.

299
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:55,940
A G Rex, if you like. That thing
is bigger, it's faster.

300
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,020
It's...even more dangerous.

301
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,220
Get the locking mechanism
working and seal that anomaly.

302
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,740
Stay with him.
Anything comes through, kill it.

303
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,300
Come on!

304
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,700
OK, let's get this thing unloaded.
I tee off in an hour.

305
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,620
Bring these four first,
these are the heavy ones.

306
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,460
All right, lads...

307
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,100
Come and have a look at this!

308
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,180
Get back, get back inside the plane!

309
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,140
Quick, get back in!

310
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,460
Now there's something
you don't see every day.

311
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,540
Stay under the plane.

312
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,900
I'll go and check on the crew,
I've got to get them down.

313
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,340
What is that thing?
It doesn't matter.

314
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,380
Don't worry,
we'll get you out of here.

315
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,300
Come on. Come on...

316
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,860
Get out!

317
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,940
Come on!

318
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,860
Get out of the car!

319
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,860
Get out of the car!

320
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,260
Get out! Get out of the car!

321
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,500
Let's turn and burn.

322
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,500
Change of plan. You stay here,

323
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,140
You'll be safer where you are.

324
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,460
My shoulder hurts, you take over.

325
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,820
If I don't get this story first,
I'll sue the government

326
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,140
for theft, false imprisonment,
infringement of copyright

327
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,780
and anything else that
the lawyers can think of.

328
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,820
Why have you stopped?

329
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,940
I want 20 per cent
of the merchandising.

330
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,780
10.

331
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,180
All right, 20.
Just get us out of here.

332
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,300
Yes!

333
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,260
Oh, thank you!

334
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,980
It works.

335
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,900
Never doubted you for a second.

336
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,820
Where have you been?

337
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,740
Connor...

338
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,700
Connor, we need some help.

339
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,500
OK. Stay here, don't touch anything.

340
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,140
Jenny, we'll be with you in seconds.
Just hang on.

341
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,980
Pull over here. By the tow truck.

342
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,540
See you in a bit.

343
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,620
Come on, girl.

344
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,900
Abby, what the hell is he doing?

345
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,860
He's creating a diversion.

346
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,860
No, no no no no no!

347
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,820
I'm not going to out-run this thing!

348
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,260
Just stop!

349
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,180
Connor...

350
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,380
Just don't move.

351
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,660
Don't move.

352
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,580
Come on, you ugly sod.
Let's have you.

353
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,780
Who's that?

354
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,140
Here.

355
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,820
Identify yourself, please.

356
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,940
Will you please identify yourself.

357
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,100
Bear with me a sec.
A little bit busy at the moment.

358
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,700
Danny, do you have the first idea
what you're doing up there?!

359
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,100
Look, don't worry,
I'm an experienced pilot.

360
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,860
How experienced?

361
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,580
Two lessons. But they went
unbelievably well.

362
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,100
All right. What's the plan?

363
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,260
Well, to be honest,

364
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,420
I'm pretty much making it up
as I go along.

365
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,620
Get in.

366
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,700
Get in!
What?

367
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,220
What sort of lunatic is he?

368
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,060
I think he's trying to lead it back
into the hangar.

369
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,300
Connor, did you lock the anomaly?
Oh, yes.

370
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,220
Oh, no...

371
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:24,180
Get back to the hangar,
quick as you can. There, here!

372
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,220
Ow, Connor, that's my...

373
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,620
It is opening, don't stop.

374
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,580
I bruise easily, you know.

375
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,300
This is cool.

376
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,260
This is good.

377
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,580
Come on, let's go.

378
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,460
Where are we going?

379
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,540
The camera.

380
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,940
We need evidence.
Let's just get out of here.

381
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,900
No! I want that footage!

382
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,100
What do you think you're doing?!
Ever heard of freedom of the press?

383
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,140
Connor, now!

384
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,820
You know what, I quit!

385
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,980
Oh, this is going to be
an amazing shot!

386
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,740
Woah, woah!

387
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,100
Danny, can you hear me?

388
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,580
We need to lock it again.
He might be alive.

389
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,220
We can't take that risk.
He's got a minute.

390
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,220
But, Jenny...
I'm in charge here!

391
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,180
Just give him a chance.

392
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,900
Well, I think you're making
a big mistake.

393
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,980
OK, do it.

394
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,020
There's something coming through.

395
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,980
Lock it!

396
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,980
Wait!

397
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,420
There's a herd of them
and they're coming!

398
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,980
Connor! I can't lock it
with him in the way!

399
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,700
So what did you do
with the helicopter?

400
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,580
I'll just nip back and get it,
shall I !

401
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,540
Abby...
Yeah?

402
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:03,500
I was just wondering if you managed
to sort everything out?

403
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,020
You know, with...Jack?

404
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,180
Connor...
Yeah?

405
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,500
We need to talk.

406
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,500
Later.
OK.

407
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,700
I've got to get back now anyway.
Yeah, well,

408
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,740
I have to put this stuff away.
Perfect.

409
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,300
See you later then.
Yeah.

410
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,780
For a talk.

411
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,420
Thank you.

412
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:45,180
You saved people's lives today.
Ssh, don't worry about it.

413
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,460
Now I'm going to have to arrest you.

414
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,980
Well, we all have our own unique
way of showing appreciation.

415
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,980
You don't want to get involved
with this, Danny.

416
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,980
People get killed.
I know that, Jenny.

417
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,660
Remember?

418
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,340
Go back to your life.

419
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,660
Just forget
all this ever happened.

420
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,020
Oh, and...get some flying lessons.

421
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,180
Sorry if I got at you before.

422
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:22,500
It's all right. It was pretty
tense there for a moment.

423
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,420
You did a good job.

424
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,460
Thanks.

425
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,020
What do you want me to do
with our kamikaze pilot?

426
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,660
I was just...

427
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,620
Oh, you're kidding me!

428
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,340
Come on...

429
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,700
How's the head?

430
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,820
Don't know. Might have knocked
some sense into me.

431
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,700
Well done today.

432
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,580
Cutter would have been proud
of you.

433
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,660
Yeah.

434
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,420
And you.

435
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,820
All right?

436
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,220
Come on.

437
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,500
Hello?

438
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,500
Hang on.

439
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,340
Abby, listen, if there's...

440
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,020
If there's something that
you want to talk to me about,

441
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:51,820
some sort of problem, you can.
It's cool, I...can take it.

442
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,780
You all right?

443
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,980
Will you just put
some clothes on, please!

444
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,140
Relax. I couldn't find
any conditioner.

445
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,100
Jack. Nice to meet you.

446
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,580
Connor.

447
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,740
My baby brother.

448
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:26,180
Sorry, I was going to explain.

449
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,860
There's no explanation necessary.

450
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,900
That's...

451
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,860
That's your brother, wow.

452
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:37,060
Couldn't find somewhere to crash
for a few days, could you? Eh?

453
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,020
Abby, there's no hot water!

454
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,900
Jack needs somewhere to stay.

455
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,060
And I am his sister,
it's only temporary, Connor.

456
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,420
Of course.

457
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,420
That's...that's cool. I'll just...

458
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:54,740
I'll stay at a mate's house or
something. Sure you're OK with it?

459
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,220
A hundred percent.
Thank you.

460
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,700
Thank you.
Oh...

461
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,540
Hello, you two.

462
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,820
It looks like we're going
on holiday. Yay!

463
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,540
Yay!

464
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,020
Wicked.

465
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,820
I appreciate how hard things
have been for everyone.

466
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,100
So I wanted to say thank you.

467
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,020
For everything you've done.

468
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,460
Calm, controlled
and slightly dull.

469
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,260
Just like you asked for.

470
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,220
Except for that G Rex, of course.

471
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,540
Oh, minor detail.

472
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,420
I spoke to Christine Johnson.
Oh?

473
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,380
Did she tell you anything?

474
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,340
No. I didn't expect her to.

475
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,980
I see.
She's definitely up to something.

476
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:59,700
And I'm going to find out what,
have no fear of that.

477
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:03,580
You think the creatures
are frightening, Jenny,

478
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,900
you should try the civil service.

479
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,780
The fate of the nation possibly
the world hangs on what we do here.

480
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,780
We need to find Sir Richard now.

481
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,660
It's not a place
for chancers and wide-boys.

482
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:32,340
Woah woah woah! You've seen
what I can do and I want in.

483
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:35,700
What we thought was ash is spores.
It'll spread through London.

484
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,140
This could be tricky
to explain to next of kin.

485
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,260
Bad news,
he's turned into a mushroom.

486
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,220
Corner it and then we grill it,
right?

487
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,860
That thing was a man
not long ago.

488
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,100
So, we ask it nicely,
then we grill it.

489
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,460
Do not use a flame thrower.

490
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,900
Jenny!
