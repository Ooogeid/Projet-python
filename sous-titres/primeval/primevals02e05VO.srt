1
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:31,840
- Sprat needs to go.
- You've got legs.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,289
I'm busy, Steve.

3
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:34,967
She's your dog.

4
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:37,279
You said you'd look after her, remember?

5
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:41,840
Want to go wee-wees on Steve's car?

6
00:00:42,565 --> 00:00:44,294
You do? Good girl!

7
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,882
Oi!

8
00:01:01,108 --> 00:01:02,059
Sprat!

9
00:01:03,903 --> 00:01:05,089
Sprat!

10
00:01:05,747 --> 00:01:06,640
Come back!

11
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:08,015
Bad girl!

12
00:01:12,477 --> 00:01:14,086
Sprat, come back!

13
00:01:17,742 --> 00:01:18,839
Sprat!

14
00:01:19,278 --> 00:01:20,332
No!

15
00:01:21,537 --> 00:01:22,680
Come back!

16
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:24,891
Bad girl, come back!

17
00:01:25,971 --> 00:01:27,083
Sprat?

18
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:30,760
Sprat?

19
00:01:31,732 --> 00:01:32,960
Where are you, girl?

20
00:01:37,678 --> 00:01:38,688
Sprat?

21
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:45,200
I'm coming, Sprat. It's all right.

22
00:01:45,866 --> 00:01:47,081
It's OK.

23
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:04,466
Cool.

24
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:08,760
Sprat?

25
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:13,071
Sprat!

26
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:15,539
I don't think we belong here.

27
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,318
Run, girl! Run!

28
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:28,454
Come on, over here!

29
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:31,718
Over here!

30
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,600
Sprat!

31
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,293
Transcript: evarin - Sync: MNk & Golgi

32
00:03:22,717 --> 00:03:23,976
Cutter?

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,522
Come on, show me where you are!

34
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,195
No! No! What...

35
00:03:35,456 --> 00:03:38,400
- What's up?
- I'm not sure, it's just... crashed.

36
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:40,110
Has it ever happened before?

37
00:03:40,856 --> 00:03:41,866
No.

38
00:03:42,173 --> 00:03:44,646
Maybe it was some sort of power surge.

39
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,840
Because of the anomaly.
It could be a false alarm.

40
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:50,181
But there could be an active
anomaly out there right now!

41
00:03:50,301 --> 00:03:52,780
I'll reboot it. One second.

42
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:00,840
Really strange.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,600
Everything seems to be fine now.

44
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:04,960
Run a full diagnostic.

45
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,879
- It's completely contaminated.
- Spyware.

46
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:23,728
Allowing the user to
switch the feed from here

47
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:26,520
- to wherever they are.
- And cut us out the loop.

48
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:31,760
It must be that guy! The Cleaner.

49
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,315
What do we do?

50
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,160
First of all, find the anomaly.

51
00:04:37,321 --> 00:04:39,280
Then clean up the detector.

52
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,062
And don't say a word to anybody.

53
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:20,659
You've one hour.

54
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:24,000
- Don't leave any trace of yourselves.
- We know what we're doing.

55
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:26,220
Really?

56
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,273
The last time you let Cutter see you.
That wasn't part of the plan, was it?

57
00:05:40,956 --> 00:05:41,960
They're in.

58
00:05:54,227 --> 00:05:56,360
This better not be another false alarm.

59
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:58,480
- Why, were you busy?
- Engagement party.

60
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,640
Very nice. Anybody we know?

61
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:01,880
Mine, actually.

62
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,464
Not my idea.

63
00:06:04,584 --> 00:06:07,000
Future mother-in-law.
It's all rather dreary.

64
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:10,230
- So you'd rather be with us?
- I was going to say, any excuse.

65
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,880
So yes, even you.

66
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,341
- We have an active sign.
- I'll get changed.

67
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:19,000
No time. The anomaly's been open
for two hours, maybe longer.

68
00:06:19,827 --> 00:06:21,707
Right, well, if I break a heel,

69
00:06:21,827 --> 00:06:23,000
you're gonna pay.

70
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:32,062
She looks amazing.

71
00:06:34,155 --> 00:06:35,633
So does a Thalosa Raptor.

72
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,462
<i>No visuals.</i>

73
00:06:48,582 --> 00:06:49,837
<i>Confirm.</i>

74
00:06:49,957 --> 00:06:51,099
<i>No life forms.</i>

75
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:56,440
Wait.

76
00:06:58,579 --> 00:06:59,920
Movement two o'clock.

77
00:07:01,783 --> 00:07:02,920
It's a little girl.

78
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,880
Stop.

79
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,083
Hey!

80
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:06,760
I'm over here!

81
00:07:07,732 --> 00:07:09,920
Follow me. Resume your mission.

82
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:12,480
- What?
- Follow me. This is not a rescue.

83
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,040
Move it!

84
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,600
She's just a little girl!
You can't leave her out here.

85
00:07:17,761 --> 00:07:20,200
We're not social workers.
Let someone else save her.

86
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:21,920
Who's gonna find her out here?

87
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:23,760
Get off the sand!

88
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:26,080
Lester's got a group
of scientists who can do it.

89
00:07:26,941 --> 00:07:28,280
We've got a job to do.

90
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:32,290
I'm trying to save you!

91
00:07:35,597 --> 00:07:37,380
- Hey, look!
- What is it?

92
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,720
- Some kind of snake.
- What are you waiting for?

93
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,480
Oh, no...

94
00:08:41,206 --> 00:08:42,874
You don't mind, do you?

95
00:08:43,311 --> 00:08:45,302
I got slimed in the Devonian.

96
00:08:46,633 --> 00:08:48,843
The smell would make your eyes water.

97
00:08:50,307 --> 00:08:53,467
And this was the only shower
you could find within a million years?

98
00:08:55,247 --> 00:08:57,559
Stop staring and pass me a towel.

99
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,640
What are you doing here?

100
00:09:00,077 --> 00:09:02,920
You and I both know things
can't go on like this.

101
00:09:03,845 --> 00:09:05,800
The anomalies are getting worse.

102
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,440
How long do you think the government
can keep on covering them up?

103
00:09:09,743 --> 00:09:12,260
How long is Nick going
to keep playing their game?

104
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,920
- Forget it, Helen, I'm not interested.
- Never mind how you feel about me.

105
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,489
You know this is wrong.

106
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:19,800
You've gotta go.

107
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:21,640
Do you know what's really sad?

108
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,356
You don't know you're being betrayed!
They're not even being honest with you.

109
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:28,180
- What are you talking about?
- He hasn't told you, has he?

110
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:30,200
That's Nick for you.

111
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,242
Never was much good at trusting people.

112
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,320
Tell me what this is about.

113
00:09:35,396 --> 00:09:36,493
I don't know much.

114
00:09:36,613 --> 00:09:39,560
I just know they have another
agenda that you don't know about.

115
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,088
Who does?

116
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,840
You mean Lester?

117
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,376
I don't know who's behind it.

118
00:09:46,675 --> 00:09:48,040
But if the shoe fits...

119
00:09:53,502 --> 00:09:55,463
Call me when they're back.
I want a full report.

120
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,980
<i>I can't stay here.
I should be at the Ark.</i>

121
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,497
You stay there until the area is clear.
Understood?

122
00:10:03,327 --> 00:10:04,644
Did you say something?

123
00:10:05,844 --> 00:10:07,030
Just goodbye.

124
00:10:36,906 --> 00:10:39,339
It's me. Cutter's here.
I'm going to have to get out.

125
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:40,712
<i>What about your men?</i>

126
00:10:40,832 --> 00:10:43,799
No sign, but don't worry,
we've got contingency plans.

127
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:46,967
<i>- If Nick finds out...</i>
- Well, he won't.

128
00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:58,305
It's over here.
It's in the drainage pipe.

129
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:01,576
You'll have to contact the builders
and close this site down.

130
00:11:01,696 --> 00:11:04,810
Sure. I'll throw some building
code violations at them.

131
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,440
Back up, back up!

132
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:23,897
What am I supposed to do with it?

133
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,720
It's called Sprat and...

134
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:30,881
- it lives a few streets from here.
- She.

135
00:11:31,696 --> 00:11:32,920
It's a she.

136
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:36,200
She is shedding hair on my new dress.

137
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,240
We've got bigger problems
than your new dress.

138
00:11:39,957 --> 00:11:41,844
The owner might be on the other side.

139
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,960
What would you do in my position?

140
00:11:51,822 --> 00:11:53,400
What did you say to her, exactly?

141
00:11:54,535 --> 00:11:55,720
Well, you know,

142
00:11:56,218 --> 00:11:58,160
I think I said I loved her.

143
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,467
You think?

144
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:02,291
I did say that. It's just...

145
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,052
She was a bit busy.
She might have forgotten.

146
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:07,740
Women don't forget things like that.

147
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,800
She'll wait for you
to make the next move.

148
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,215
- Really?
- Yeah.

149
00:12:12,492 --> 00:12:13,677
Right...

150
00:12:14,043 --> 00:12:15,360
So what's that?

151
00:12:15,677 --> 00:12:16,892
That's up to you.

152
00:12:17,317 --> 00:12:18,868
But whatever it is, be confident.

153
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,638
Confidence is sexy.

154
00:12:21,297 --> 00:12:23,480
If you love Abby, just tell her.

155
00:12:25,475 --> 00:12:26,865
- Just tell her...
- Yeah.

156
00:12:27,802 --> 00:12:29,520
You wouldn't do it for me, would you?

157
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,275
- I can be confident anyway.
- Yeah.

158
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:35,574
Aren't you forgetting someone?

159
00:12:39,453 --> 00:12:41,367
I don't think it's working out with her.

160
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:43,480
- She needs to know that.
- Really?

161
00:12:43,641 --> 00:12:44,480
Yeah.

162
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:47,188
I should tell her.

163
00:12:48,944 --> 00:12:51,197
Honesty's important in these things,
isn't it?

164
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:03,057
Go on, then. Your big day.

165
00:13:04,908 --> 00:13:08,040
Seriously, guys, prepare to be amazed.

166
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:17,639
What?

167
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,840
It's a prototype. Not meant to be sexy.

168
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:25,800
That's not gonna make it through
the pipe, let alone the anomaly.

169
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,104
Can we have faith?
And a little bit of silence?

170
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:31,400
Thank you.

171
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,842
Is that my hair dryer?

172
00:13:39,188 --> 00:13:40,168
Might be.

173
00:13:44,243 --> 00:13:46,175
Now I know what Galileo
had to put up with.

174
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,920
High CO2, low oxygen.

175
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:02,278
It's pre-Carboniferous.

176
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,517
Maybe Ordovician or Silurian.

177
00:14:05,461 --> 00:14:07,100
There's no dinosaurs,

178
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:08,520
no mammals,

179
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,451
and there's no birds.

180
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,964
Wait a minute. What's that?

181
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:17,800
- It's a little girl!
- What is she doing?

182
00:14:17,961 --> 00:14:19,560
She's looking for her dog.

183
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,040
She might be injured.

184
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:24,137
There's nothing in
the Silurian to injure her.

185
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,280
We're talking a few
basic plants and bugs.

186
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,200
- How big are the bugs?
- Bug size, I think.

187
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:32,840
It's a pretty safe
period to get lost in.

188
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,330
She must be terrified.

189
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,437
We have to get her out.

190
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,988
Let's do it.

191
00:14:58,391 --> 00:15:00,250
- Have you got a headache?
- Yeah.

192
00:15:02,228 --> 00:15:04,320
It's the altitude.
There's no oxygen.

193
00:15:04,681 --> 00:15:06,897
Maybe that's why the kid hasn't moved.

194
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:18,688
Can you hear that?

195
00:15:56,983 --> 00:15:59,560
I don't think it's working out
with me and Caroline.

196
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,447
Never really had that...

197
00:16:02,052 --> 00:16:03,186
chemistry.

198
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,667
Chemistry, yeah.

199
00:16:08,602 --> 00:16:09,877
It's important.

200
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:14,960
Yep.

201
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,681
So, do you think I should...

202
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,856
finish with her?

203
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,101
I think you should...

204
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:28,200
do what's right for you.

205
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:37,271
- What are you doing?
- Dumping her.

206
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,640
By text?

207
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,507
You can't do that. That is horrible.

208
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,680
- Thought I should do what I found good.
- I didn't mean that way.

209
00:16:45,092 --> 00:16:46,120
- No?
- No!

210
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:48,499
Come on.

211
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:52,135
That's humiliating.
No-one deserves that, not even her.

212
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,080
- She was where?
- She fell down a pipe.

213
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:05,143
She fell down a pipe?

214
00:17:05,397 --> 00:17:07,907
Look, I've got to do something.
Where is she?

215
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,728
- Steve, let the experts do their job.
- I need to help!

216
00:17:10,848 --> 00:17:13,239
The best thing you
can do is just wait here,

217
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,120
I thought she'd run away.

218
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,679
But I've... I've been trying my best.

219
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,960
I'm not her real dad, okay?
Her mum...

220
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:24,320
I'll let you know the moment
there's any news.

221
00:17:27,287 --> 00:17:28,388
What's that?

222
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,440
Heckler and Koch G36.

223
00:17:40,078 --> 00:17:42,720
This is an army issue.
This is a classic mercenary's gun.

224
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,720
Hard drive, night vision.
This is serious stuff.

225
00:17:49,044 --> 00:17:50,068
He's here.

226
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:52,600
Who is?

227
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,624
There's no footprints leading the way.

228
00:17:54,744 --> 00:17:58,240
They've left their water.
They've just disappeared.

229
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,169
<i>We're not social workers.</i>

230
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,120
- <i>Let someone someone else save her.</i>
- <i>Who's gonna find her out here?</i>

231
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:10,413
<i>Look!</i>

232
00:18:10,838 --> 00:18:13,795
- <i>It's some kind of snake!</i>
- <i>What are you waiting for?</i>

233
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:16,055
<i>What the hell is it?</i>

234
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,200
- <i>What is that thing?</i>
- <i>Oh, God!</i>

235
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:42,291
They're all dead.

236
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,600
You're not surprised by this, are you?
What do you know?

237
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,380
- Nothing.
- Cutter,

238
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,560
- there's a traitor on the team.
- Maybe.

239
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,240
- It's Lester.
- It's someone.

240
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,534
They're playing us.
They have been since the beginning.

241
00:18:54,654 --> 00:18:56,680
I don't know that.
And neither do you.

242
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,694
Fine. You admitted you don't know.

243
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:02,380
But rather than sharing it with us,
you shut us out

244
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,370
and we'll never be a team.

245
00:19:06,051 --> 00:19:07,680
You sound like Helen.

246
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,380
We don't have time for this,
we've got to get going.

247
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:21,708
<i>Hey! I'm here!</i>

248
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:22,968
Hang on a minute.

249
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:27,373
- What's she saying?
- I don't know, I can't hear.

250
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,240
The rocks! Get to the rocks!

251
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,200
- Run!
- All right, let's get going.

252
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,920
- What is that?
- I don't know.

253
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,320
Run!

254
00:20:07,943 --> 00:20:09,400
Quick! Come on!

255
00:20:14,803 --> 00:20:16,560
Run! Get to the rocks!

256
00:20:20,388 --> 00:20:21,219
Run!

257
00:20:37,896 --> 00:20:39,191
You're welcome!

258
00:20:48,111 --> 00:20:49,908
So, are you OK?

259
00:20:54,082 --> 00:20:54,913
Here.

260
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,989
It will make you feel better.

261
00:21:07,028 --> 00:21:08,303
That's better.

262
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:12,244
Now,

263
00:21:12,748 --> 00:21:14,341
we've got to get you out of here.

264
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:16,920
- Are you gonna rescue me?
- Yeah. Any objections?

265
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,569
I was planning my own way back.

266
00:21:19,762 --> 00:21:22,400
You messed it up
by making those things angry.

267
00:21:22,911 --> 00:21:24,520
She's fine. Doesn't need any hep.

268
00:21:26,254 --> 00:21:28,960
You can tag along with me...
if you want.

269
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:31,400
Well, thanks.

270
00:21:34,485 --> 00:21:35,720
What are those things?

271
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:38,080
Dunno. But they're pretty horrible.

272
00:21:38,428 --> 00:21:40,640
- They killed the soldiers.
- You saw that?

273
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:42,292
Heard it mostly.

274
00:21:42,698 --> 00:21:44,640
I just know they come
if you walk on the sand.

275
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,708
- They must sense the vibrations.
- We're gonna have to go the way round.

276
00:21:49,102 --> 00:21:52,074
If we stick to the rocks,
we can get close enough to the anomaly.

277
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:54,548
- What's wrong with your leg?
- Twisted it.

278
00:21:54,668 --> 00:21:57,040
I made it to the rocks,
but they ate my dog.

279
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,120
Your dog's alive.
She's on the other side.

280
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:00,368
Cool.

281
00:22:02,068 --> 00:22:05,120
She left me behind, then.
That coward.

282
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:07,319
Let me look at your leg.

283
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,480
- You can't walk on that.
- Why do you think I've been sat here?

284
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,720
- I'm gonna have to carry you.
- No way!

285
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,129
- What's your name, anyway?
- Taylor.

286
00:22:21,786 --> 00:22:24,160
And I ain't baggage.
No-one has to carry me.

287
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,740
- She ain't baggage.
- She ain't baggage.

288
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:30,349
So, is this some kind of giant wind-up?

289
00:22:30,469 --> 00:22:31,300
What?

290
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:33,617
One minute I'm in Hackney

291
00:22:33,737 --> 00:22:35,493
and the next I'm in the desert.

292
00:22:35,613 --> 00:22:38,701
The way I look at it, I've probably
been hypnotised or something

293
00:22:38,821 --> 00:22:41,233
and you've brought me here
as this big joke.

294
00:22:41,353 --> 00:22:43,359
- I bet there are cameras everywhere.
- Yeah,

295
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:46,563
and the public gets to vote
which one of us gets eaten first.

296
00:22:46,683 --> 00:22:48,653
It's cooler than Big Brother.

297
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,953
All right...

298
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:01,489
Job done.

299
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,184
What was that?

300
00:23:06,715 --> 00:23:07,720
I don't know.

301
00:23:08,928 --> 00:23:11,520
Please tell me it's not rats,
they really freak me out.

302
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,320
No.

303
00:23:13,584 --> 00:23:16,200
- Too many legs for a rat.
- How many legs are we talking?

304
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:18,087
Plenty.

305
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,680
- Look, it's getting away. Quick.
- What about the...

306
00:23:36,794 --> 00:23:38,560
Stephen, it's fading!

307
00:23:40,137 --> 00:23:42,520
Put me down! Put me down!

308
00:23:59,924 --> 00:24:01,006
This way!

309
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,197
What are you doing?

310
00:24:12,758 --> 00:24:15,760
Food Standards Agency.
Hygiene spot check.

311
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,520
- You can't just run...
- When was the last time you washed it?

312
00:24:19,757 --> 00:24:21,090
Think about it.

313
00:24:27,971 --> 00:24:29,285
Sorry...

314
00:24:30,986 --> 00:24:32,744
It's over there! Over there!

315
00:24:32,956 --> 00:24:35,080
Everything's OK.
Everything's fine, guys.

316
00:24:37,536 --> 00:24:39,081
What are we waiting for?

317
00:24:39,294 --> 00:24:40,480
I love this job.

318
00:24:58,521 --> 00:24:59,874
Connor, I've got it.

319
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:02,840
It's all right, everyone.
Honestly, it's harmless.

320
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,160
What are you doing?

321
00:25:13,477 --> 00:25:14,946
Just having a bit of a play.

322
00:25:15,391 --> 00:25:16,720
Massive ball pool fan.

323
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,800
We all love ball pools,
but now is not the time.

324
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,037
We need to get this back.

325
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,880
It's breaking up!

326
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,880
Cutter and Stephen,
they're gonna be trapped!

327
00:25:37,138 --> 00:25:39,200
We can't let that happen!
We have to warn them!

328
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,790
It's too dangerous!

329
00:25:46,027 --> 00:25:47,283
They've gone.

330
00:25:48,462 --> 00:25:49,641
It's gone.

331
00:25:51,554 --> 00:25:52,813
We've lost them.

332
00:26:06,136 --> 00:26:07,450
What happened?

333
00:26:08,822 --> 00:26:10,484
When are we going back?

334
00:26:18,967 --> 00:26:21,112
What are the chances of it reopening?

335
00:26:22,465 --> 00:26:24,205
Some do, some don't.

336
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,910
But it could be tomorrow.

337
00:26:27,142 --> 00:26:30,581
Or it could be in a thousand years,
we just don't know. That's the problem.

338
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:34,619
I'm sorry, James.

339
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,280
We may have to accept
that we've lost them.

340
00:26:37,807 --> 00:26:39,520
How long can they survive?

341
00:26:39,855 --> 00:26:41,560
If they find water,

342
00:26:41,787 --> 00:26:44,183
then they could survive for a few weeks.

343
00:26:45,459 --> 00:26:46,793
If they don't...

344
00:26:49,343 --> 00:26:50,986
So what do we do now?

345
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:52,480
We carry on.

346
00:26:53,284 --> 00:26:56,160
Daphne and Scrappy will have
to take charge of the anomaly operation.

347
00:27:00,047 --> 00:27:02,578
- You mean us?
- Unfortunately, yes.

348
00:27:03,545 --> 00:27:04,878
God help us.

349
00:27:05,148 --> 00:27:07,486
Keep a permanent watch
on the anomaly site.

350
00:27:07,737 --> 00:27:09,280
If it reopens, we go in after them.

351
00:27:09,631 --> 00:27:11,520
What shall I tell the girl's stepfather?

352
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:15,160
Tell him we did our best.

353
00:27:16,182 --> 00:27:19,409
In the meantime we have no option
but to get on with the job.

354
00:27:20,395 --> 00:27:21,400
Good luck.

355
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:14,212
There you are!

356
00:28:37,304 --> 00:28:39,720
There isn't a way out of here, is there?

357
00:28:41,227 --> 00:28:42,840
- Sure there is.
- You're lying.

358
00:28:43,217 --> 00:28:44,724
Adults always lie.

359
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,778
My mum told me
she was going to be all right,

360
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:49,362
but she wasn't.

361
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:51,409
She died.

362
00:28:52,472 --> 00:28:54,800
Now you're lying too, just like her.

363
00:28:56,917 --> 00:28:59,390
We're going to die in this stupid place.

364
00:29:03,738 --> 00:29:04,782
All right...

365
00:29:05,013 --> 00:29:06,760
We're not in great shape right now,

366
00:29:07,062 --> 00:29:09,000
but I promise you one thing.

367
00:29:09,323 --> 00:29:10,975
We're not going to die.

368
00:29:13,178 --> 00:29:15,080
There are clouds due east,

369
00:29:15,555 --> 00:29:18,180
which could mean a body of water,
vegetation...

370
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,923
so, food and shelter.

371
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:21,952
We should head that way.

372
00:29:23,556 --> 00:29:26,551
We stay on the rocks
as far as we can, all right?

373
00:29:31,517 --> 00:29:33,560
If you try to pick me up again,
I'll bite you.

374
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,760
I've got some lovely food for you.

375
00:30:33,087 --> 00:30:35,360
Got you, lizard!

376
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:40,334
Would you rather die
of thirst or be eaten?

377
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,931
I think I'd rather be eaten,

378
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:45,720
then at least it's quick.
Two bites. Done.

379
00:30:46,373 --> 00:30:48,999
You're like four or five bites,
so it would be worse for you.

380
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:52,760
Can you not try
and be positive for five minutes?

381
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,120
You know, hopeful.

382
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,080
We're probably the best food around.

383
00:30:56,427 --> 00:30:59,960
Imagine you're a giant sand thing
living on nothing but millipedes

384
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,840
and then you get to taste people
for the first time, all gooey and warm.

385
00:31:04,307 --> 00:31:07,400
We'd be like a delicacy.
So who will they eat first?

386
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,981
Why don't you sing a song or whistle,
or something?

387
00:31:11,101 --> 00:31:13,920
Anything. Just stop talking.

388
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,327
What?

389
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,080
- Did you see that?
- What?

390
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,410
Forget it.

391
00:31:54,396 --> 00:31:55,400
Oh, thank God!

392
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:00,200
- Oh, yes!
- What is it?

393
00:32:00,482 --> 00:32:01,700
That's hope.

394
00:32:01,932 --> 00:32:04,266
- We've found a new anomaly.
- Which way?

395
00:32:04,386 --> 00:32:05,835
I can hear a train.

396
00:32:06,715 --> 00:32:09,480
- There were no trains in the Silurian.
- It's not a train.

397
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,880
It's a sand storm. Let's go. Run!

398
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:51,276
I don't think I can do this on my own.

399
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:53,402
You won't have to.

400
00:32:55,469 --> 00:32:56,744
They'll be back.

401
00:33:01,131 --> 00:33:02,097
I know.

402
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,240
How long do we wait?

403
00:33:08,995 --> 00:33:11,662
- I can't put this off any longer.
- We'll stay here.

404
00:33:13,327 --> 00:33:14,960
Call me if there's any change or...

405
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:18,680
Just call me.

406
00:33:30,957 --> 00:33:32,406
Leek, get over here.

407
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:36,533
Any news?

408
00:33:40,069 --> 00:33:41,229
Sorry, sir.

409
00:33:42,736 --> 00:33:43,953
A terrible loss.

410
00:33:44,436 --> 00:33:45,800
Such a brilliant man

411
00:33:46,176 --> 00:33:48,658
- and of course a good friend.
- Are you out of your mind?

412
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:51,575
- Cutter and I loathed each other.
- I didn't realise.

413
00:33:51,695 --> 00:33:54,920
If there's one thing I despise more
than stupidity, it's sentimentality.

414
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,960
Go on. I assume you've got
some kind of work to do.

415
00:33:59,674 --> 00:34:00,800
Yes, I certainly do.

416
00:34:21,695 --> 00:34:23,391
I dropped the damned detector.

417
00:34:23,511 --> 00:34:25,405
So this is where hope gets you.

418
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,439
Remind me to tell Connor
he did a good job on these things.

419
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,636
Which way?

420
00:35:00,614 --> 00:35:02,930
- I'll take that.
- I thought it might be you!

421
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,720
There's only one ticket out of here
and I'm taking it.

422
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:15,625
And the water.

423
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,000
Nah. All of it.

424
00:35:29,383 --> 00:35:31,560
Without water we're gonna be dead
in a couple of hours.

425
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:33,680
Tough break.

426
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,000
Come on. Take us with you.

427
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,160
At least take the girl.
She's done nothing wrong.

428
00:35:45,624 --> 00:35:47,160
At least leave us some water.

429
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,480
You follow me, I'll shoot you.

430
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:53,200
We're dead anyway.

431
00:35:55,537 --> 00:35:56,774
I'm warning you.

432
00:35:59,981 --> 00:36:02,513
- You think I'm scared of you?
- You should be.

433
00:36:09,347 --> 00:36:10,240
Help me!

434
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
Tough break.

435
00:36:15,395 --> 00:36:16,690
It's eating me!

436
00:36:20,899 --> 00:36:21,981
Stay here!

437
00:36:24,164 --> 00:36:26,200
Who sent you!
It was Lester, wasn't it?

438
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,359
I'm a professional.

439
00:36:30,596 --> 00:36:31,891
I don't talk...

440
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,840
ever.

441
00:36:51,163 --> 00:36:54,139
You're absolutely certain
you don't know anything?

442
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:55,800
I know one thing.

443
00:36:56,515 --> 00:36:59,723
It's not a great idea to run
and shout in the sand.

444
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:02,912
Good point.

445
00:37:12,245 --> 00:37:15,640
We've got no choice, but
if we tread lightly, we should be OK.

446
00:37:16,752 --> 00:37:20,655
According to this the anomaly should be
over the crescent of the dune.

447
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,720
Take my arm!

448
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,600
- Hold on! Hold on!
- It's got me.

449
00:37:59,808 --> 00:38:01,800
No! No, stand still! Stay till!

450
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,320
Back!

451
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:25,320
Stay back.

452
00:38:44,131 --> 00:38:45,155
Take her!

453
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:46,680
- Come on!
- I need the bag!

454
00:38:49,271 --> 00:38:50,680
Ditch the bag!

455
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,880
Get outta there!

456
00:39:00,969 --> 00:39:02,032
Come on!

457
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,880
What are you doing? Look!

458
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,840
Quick, get in!

459
00:39:34,811 --> 00:39:35,796
Hold on!

460
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,080
- Are we going home now?
- We're going somewhere.

461
00:40:08,665 --> 00:40:11,544
We're not at home,
but at least there's no sand.

462
00:40:13,226 --> 00:40:15,989
- Any guesses where we are?
- Well, the air's normal.

463
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:19,800
Woodland looks familiar, it's gotta be
within the last few thousand years.

464
00:40:20,742 --> 00:40:21,766
Hey, look!

465
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,160
Middle Palaeolithic.
Stephen, we gotta get away from here.

466
00:40:57,883 --> 00:40:59,487
That doesn't look right.

467
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,240
- I think I just punched an actor!
- Yeah.

468
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:13,264
- I knew you'd make it back!
- It is really,

469
00:41:13,384 --> 00:41:14,800
really good to see you guys.

470
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,960
Yeah, a few basic plants.
Some bugs...

471
00:41:18,966 --> 00:41:19,836
What?

472
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,219
These are the highest stakes
we've ever played for.

473
00:41:27,339 --> 00:41:29,880
You say a word now,
we could lose everything.

474
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,731
- So do nothing?
- We just have to be sure.

475
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:35,480
Welcome to
The Lost World Adventure Park,

476
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,920
complete with cavemen,
concrete dinosaurs and water slides.

477
00:41:43,474 --> 00:41:45,078
I never thought I'd say this, but

478
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:48,576
given the choice between you and Connor,
I'm glad to have you back.

479
00:41:48,904 --> 00:41:52,633
When we picked up the anomaly,
we had no idea what might come through.

480
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:54,840
You are lucky we don't shoot on sight.

481
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,336
Well, I'd better go and soothe
your cave man.

482
00:42:00,703 --> 00:42:04,587
Let's hope the Palaeolithic was short
on ambulance-chasing lawyers.

483
00:42:14,007 --> 00:42:15,668
I'm so sorry, Steve.

484
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,736
- We did all we could.
- No.

485
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,200
No, you said...

486
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:24,560
You're OK!

487
00:42:26,324 --> 00:42:29,280
Oh God, I've been so worried.
If anything had happened to you...

488
00:42:29,552 --> 00:42:32,160
- You're upset?
- Of course I'm upset.

489
00:42:32,972 --> 00:42:34,111
I love you!

490
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:37,415
Listen, Taylor,

491
00:42:37,881 --> 00:42:40,389
I miss your mum too.

492
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,550
Yeah?

493
00:42:42,709 --> 00:42:43,714
I know.

494
00:42:44,545 --> 00:42:46,438
- Sorry, Steve.
- No, no.

495
00:42:46,766 --> 00:42:49,240
Guess what, I've been back
millions of years in the past and

496
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,000
almost got eaten by giant scorpions.

497
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,360
Of course you have, darling.
Of course you have.

498
00:42:58,995 --> 00:43:00,019
Thank you.

499
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:07,130
I thought I was never gonna
see you again.

500
00:43:07,381 --> 00:43:09,197
Bet you were devastated!

501
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:11,265
Inconsolable.

502
00:43:12,347 --> 00:43:13,600
Oi, you!

503
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,880
Can I come and work with you
when I leave school?

504
00:43:17,404 --> 00:43:20,200
Yeah, all right.
You'd be pretty good at it.

505
00:43:21,095 --> 00:43:22,969
- See ya!
- See ya.

506
00:43:26,617 --> 00:43:28,569
So can I get changed now?

507
00:43:59,342 --> 00:44:01,970
<i>A young girl trapped down a hole
on a city building site</i>

508
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:04,240
<i>was dramatically rescued today.</i>

509
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,360
<i>It's believed the girl was pursuing
her pet dog when she became trapped.</i>

510
00:44:08,585 --> 00:44:12,527
<i>Police and fire crews worked through
the night to free Taylor Praed, 11.</i>

511
00:44:13,048 --> 00:44:14,960
<i>Her condition was described
by sources...</i>

512
00:44:15,251 --> 00:44:17,434
So the chicken goes
down the embankment...

513
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:20,719
drops the book in front of the frog
and the frog is like, "Readit!"

514
00:44:22,383 --> 00:44:23,252
What?

515
00:44:38,862 --> 00:44:39,983
Where's Rex?

516
00:44:52,912 --> 00:44:54,941
<i>Taylor, whose mother died recently,</i>

517
00:44:55,061 --> 00:44:58,398
<i>has just issued a statement
thanking the emergency services</i>

518
00:44:58,518 --> 00:45:00,314
<i>and members of the public...</i>

519
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,072
Damn it!
