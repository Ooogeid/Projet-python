1
00:00:02,478 --> 00:00:03,780
Get out of sterling fast.

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,300
And I want every barrel
of oil you can find.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,480
I don't care what it costs.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,700
It'll be worth twice
as much by lunchtime.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,999
Lloyd, I need that information
on the Price Cooper acquisition.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,300
Go round to my flat.
The paperwork's there somewhere.

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,600
"Mr Richard, I have the papers."

8
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,079
And can I just say that
your new piece is tremendous?

9
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,839
I haven't acquired
anything in months.

10
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,280
I love the light effect.
Can I touch it?

11
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:10,080
Never touch the investments, Lloyd.

12
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,300
Sorry, sir. I'll have the
papers sent straight over.

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,400
Now, that is cool.

14
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,400
Crazy.

15
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,639
Yes, what is it now?

16
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,559
I... Argh!

17
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,900
Come on, man, I haven't got all day.

18
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,500
Lloyd, you're fired!

19
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:37,000
<font color="#ffff00">Prime Team Presents :</font>

21
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,300
Primeval s03ep05

22
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:15,999
Morning.

23
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,240
Do you always bring
this much stuff to work?

24
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,300
Yes.

25
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,359
I like to be prepared.

26
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,780
I know some of the
creatures can be frightening,

27
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,900
but surely this many pairs of
underpants is overdoing it?

28
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,600
Nancy, where's Sid gone?

29
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,880
Talk to me.

30
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,600
We have an intruder in Sector Seven.

31
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,580
No identification as yet.

32
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,880
Is it small and ugly
in a kind of cute way?

33
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,000
Just a guess.

34
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,800
Helen?

35
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
Prepare to shoot on sight.

36
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,680
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- I don't believe it!

37
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,439
You've really got to do
something about your security.

38
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,900
How did you get in?

39
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,400
Jumped the perimeter fence and
kicked in a fire door. It was easy.

40
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,920
What the hell are you doing here?

41
00:04:46,081 --> 00:04:49,400
It's my ambition to fight
dinosaurs, save the world.

42
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,759
Look, I just want to help,
that's all.

43
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,980
- I warned you to stay away from this.
- I thought you were flirting.

44
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,780
It's hard to read women today.

45
00:04:57,961 --> 00:04:58,800
Can you pistol whip him?

46
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:00,880
- Sir?
- Just a thought.

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,280
- Mr Quinn...
- It's um, Danny.

48
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,600
Mr Quinn,

49
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,780
the fate of the nation, possibly
the world, hangs on what we do here.

50
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,880
It's not a place for
chancers and wide boys.

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,100
My brother was killed by a creature.

52
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,599
Don't ask me to pretend
it didn't happen.

53
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,920
You've seen what I can do,
and I want in.

54
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,400
Lloyd!

55
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:45,200
Idiot!

56
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,080
Pollution's getting worse
every day, isn't it, sir?

57
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,880
It's the traffic.

58
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,680
Find a shortcut.
I can't be late for my train.

59
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,500
Turn the heating up, would you?

60
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,400
I'm freezing.

61
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,300
Sid!

62
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,300
- Connor, I think I've found something.
- Show me.

63
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,300
It's like some kind of lettering.

64
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,180
No, it's a sequence of numbers.

65
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,500
- OK. Some kind of code?
- Yes, but to what?

66
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:52,480
Connor, come in and shut the door.

67
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,080
- Really?
- Yeah.

68
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,400
This new lab is amazing.

69
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,200
The temperature and humidity
settings are exactly right

70
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,400
and the plants flowered... overnight.

71
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,800
That was your cue to
tell me how clever I am.

72
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,600
You're brilliant.

73
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,200
How's it going, staying
at your mate's place?

74
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,900
It's good, yeah. All that's...

75
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,500
You know what it's like
when old friends get together.

76
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,000
How about you? How is it
living with your baby brother?

77
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,800
You missing me yet?

78
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,400
What's he doing here?

79
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,480
It's cleaning day
at my mate's house.

80
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,680
It's a nightmare.
I had to bring them to work.

81
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,380
This is a climate-controlled lab.

82
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,920
You can't treat it like a
pet's adventure playground.

83
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,080
I know, but you just trying
looking after them for one day.

84
00:07:49,241 --> 00:07:51,800
It's like Prison Break with...

85
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,500
beavers.

86
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,100
You're going nowhere until
we decide what to do with you.

87
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,520
Don't get too comfortable.

88
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,680
Karma must really work, eh, Danny?

89
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:07,800
It's not too long ago that you
had me banged up. Look at you now.

90
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,880
The fact that I saved your
life doesn't win me any credit?

91
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,141
No.

92
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,959
What does that machine do, then?

93
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:16,700
You're not even supposed to
be looking at that machine.

94
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,100
It's top secret, innit?

95
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,980
But it is brilliant.

96
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,480
And, you know,
it's completely unique.

97
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,000
Well, I bet you're
wondering who invented it?

98
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,100
Le Connor Temple.

99
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,600
What?

100
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,880
Connor Temple.
That's... I invented it.

101
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,880
So...

102
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,780
Why is that screen
jumping around, then?

103
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,500
Jumping?

104
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,600
Oh, my God!

105
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,180
Lester, before you shout at me,
I'm really sorry.

106
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,080
I'll get the hard drive memory
back up and running in seconds.

107
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,480
At the risk of sounding like
someone from the Old Testament,

108
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,600
is there any sane reason why you're
keeping animals in the ARC?

109
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,000
We must have missed an
anomaly while it was offline.

110
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,080
It closed an hour ago.
I'll get the location.

111
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,780
Yes, would you do that? Because
that would be extremely helpful!

112
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,780
- Christine Johnson is here to see you.
- Here?

113
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,880
James.
This isn't a bad time, I hope?

114
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,200
Christine,
what an unexpected pleasure.

115
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,280
- Do we know where Jenny is?
- No, sir.

116
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,200
- Could you find her for me, please?
- Yes, sir.

117
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,700
- Now?
- Now.

118
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,980
- Nothing wrong I hope, James?
- Not at all.

119
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,400
Don't you have something you
should be getting on with?

120
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,680
Excuse me, Miss Lewis?

121
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,400
We didn't know what
to do with these.

122
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,100
Professor Cutter had no family.

123
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,500
When was that taken?

124
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,900
It wasn't.

125
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,500
It's not me. It's Claudia Brown.

126
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,900
Oh my God, Sarah.
I used to be somebody else.

127
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,080
Jenny, anomaly alert.

128
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,200
- I'll cover it.
- No. No, I'm fine.

129
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,100
Wow, nice view.

130
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,700
Nice place, if you can afford it.

131
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,500
You know what...?

132
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I know a lot about art,
but I don't really know what I like.

133
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,380
OK, the flat belongs
to a Sir Richard Bentley.

134
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,680
He's the Chairman of
the ABS Finance Group.

135
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,700
First, we need to
find out what this is.

136
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,900
Is it fungal?

137
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,100
Maybe.

138
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,000
Nice!

139
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,700
And you need to go
and analyse it, quick.

140
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,180
- Thanks very much.
- That's OK.

141
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,200
Armoury to your left, gym to your
right. Research labs are there.

142
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,700
And the operations area
you already know.

143
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,780
Anything else?

144
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,880
Yes, there is just
one more thing, James.

145
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,400
In private.

146
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,500
Tell the Chuckle Brothers
not to touch anything.

147
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,580
I don't think you've met
my colleague Mark Baker,

148
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,980
and this is Captain Wilder.

149
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,500
Delighted.

150
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,900
Shall we?

151
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,980
Oi, trouble, don't think
you're going anywhere.

152
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,100
Make yourself useful. Come with me.

153
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,900
We have good reason to believe that
Helen Cutter had this object with her.

154
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,180
I'd very much like to
find out what it is.

155
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,600
- Why is it so important?
- Well, it might not be.

156
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,280
We'd like to be sure.

157
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,800
Never seen it in my life.
Perhaps it was destroyed in the fire.

158
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,500
Perhaps.

159
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,300
So tell me,

160
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,580
how is the search for
Cutter's replacement going?

161
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,680
Very well. We have a number
of excellent candidates.

162
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,980
I think I have just the
man for you. Captain Wilder.

163
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,380
He's a fine soldier and
an excellent leader of men.

164
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,880
- I'll bear him in mind.
- The Minister is very keen on him.

165
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Please do send in his CV.
I'll add it to the pile.

166
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,200
Radical!

167
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,180
Jenny, you have to get out of there!

168
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,500
Quarantine the whole block now!

169
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,980
This fungus is toxic.
It's incredibly aggressive.

170
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,700
You need to trace anybody
who's been exposed to it.

171
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,900
We need to find Sir Richard now.

172
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,380
If I was still a copper, I'd say
that bloke was acting suspiciously.

173
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,800
Mmm.

174
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,300
Where are you going?

175
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,780
You've got two choices -

176
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,280
you can trust me or you
can call in the heav mob.

177
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,780
And why would I trust you, Danny?

178
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,080
Because if I was going to cause trouble,
I'd have done it a long time ago.

179
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,800
And I've got an honest face.

180
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,380
Thank you. Bye-bye.

181
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,180
OK, that was his office.
He's catching a train.

182
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,400
He'll be at St Pancras any minute.

183
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,000
That's our guy.

184
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,200
- What exactly did you do in there?
- I didn't do anything.

185
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,980
He's still alive.
We've got to get him out.

186
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,380
Forget it. I'm handling this.
I've had biohazard training.

187
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
So have I.

188
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,080
Fine.

189
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,480
- What's going on?
- Everything under control?

190
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,500
Everything is fine.

191
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,200
- He's helping me.
- Right.

192
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,380
You've killed one of my men.

193
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,900
Care to explain why he was
trespassing in a security zone?

194
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,580
We'll send you a full report
when the post-mortem is in.

195
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,800
Now, for your own safety,
I suggest you leave.

196
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,280
How many of our men do we have
inside here?

197
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,480
Two, on the maintenance staff.

198
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,900
I want every inch
under surveillance.

199
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,580
Do you think Lester was
lying about the artefact?

200
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,200
Of course he was lying.

201
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,500
Excuse me, have you seen this man?

202
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,500
OK, the train that's departing from
the platform at the far end.

203
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,400
Excuse me.

204
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,800
Guys, we need to rethink this.

205
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,880
- Becker, you check inside the train.
- Right.

206
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,680
Better make plans to evacuate.

207
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,700
We could be lucky.
Maybe he hasn't been contaminated.

208
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,800
Sir Richard?

209
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,600
It must have come through the
anomaly.

210
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,200
Past or future?

211
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,900
Does it matter?

212
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,700
- Can you kill it?
- I'll have to do some more tests.

213
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,800
Unless we find out how to stop it, there's
going to be a lot more infected people.

214
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,600
Yes, thank you, Danny.
I do realise that.

215
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,880
- He's not on the train.
- I don't get it.

216
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm telling you,
I saw him here a minute ago.

217
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,300
Over there.

218
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,780
I'm going to get out of this thing.

219
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,400
- What are you doing? Are you mad?
- ???

220
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,800
When did you actually
have biohazard training?

221
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,380
Connor!

222
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,700
Danny!

223
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,900
What's she saying?

224
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,300
Turn around.

225
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,100
Come on, guys!

226
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,900
Come on!

227
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,900
What is that?

228
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,000
What is that?

229
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,000
Sir Richard?

230
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,300
Well, this could be tricky to
explain to the next of kin.

231
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,280
Good news,
he's not technically dead.

232
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,300
The bad news,
he's turned into a mushroom.

233
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,980
What are we going to do with it?

234
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,400
I don't know.

235
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,680
This all happened when it reacted
with the saline solution.

236
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,480
Well, all fungi like damp
environments, right?

237
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,880
- Why don't we try drying it out?
- Bake the hell out of it.

238
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,600
We'll see what happens.

239
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
These tunnels must go on for miles.

240
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,500
We're going to need some light.

241
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,800
- It's not responding.
- ??

242
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,300
Right. So come on,
what's our plan B?

243
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,500
You know, just once...
just once would be nice.

244
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,600
Look...

245
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,800
Something's happening.

246
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,600
Aaargh!

247
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,400
Result!

248
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,400
Yes!

249
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,400
Abby!

250
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,500
Take it out, now!

251
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,400
Stay back!

252
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,300
Don't touch him!

253
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,800
We need a containment unit
down here straight away.

254
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,580
If baking worked, burning's going to
be even better.

255
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,700
- We're going to incinerate it.
- Makes sense.

256
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,280
Whoa, what do you
think you're doing?

257
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,580
- What does it look like?
- Oh, that's a great idea.

258
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,380
Let's send a criminal onto the
streets with a flame thrower!

259
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,480
I'm not a criminal.
Well, you broke in here.

260
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,680
Yeah, well, I didn't steal anything,
did I?

261
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,280
You're splitting hairs. The point is,
a) you should be in custody,

262
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,380
b) you're not part of the team.

263
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,080
He's done a pretty good job for us.

264
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,200
Twice.

265
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,080
Three times.

266
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,480
We need all the help we
can get. We should trust him.

267
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,700
Fantastic! You've been here five minutes
and I've already got a mutiny on my hands.

268
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,600
- Do you know how to use that thing?
- No, but I mean how hard can it be?

269
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,880
Right, he goes,
you two geniuses stay here.

270
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,380
You're kidding?
I so wanted to fire this.

271
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,980
Find a way to stop this
before it infects anyone else.

272
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,500
I don't want any more
Fungus the Bogeymen!

273
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,100
The management accepts no responsibility
for personal loss or injury!

274
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,700
Good luck!

275
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,200
Basically, it's a fungus.

276
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,800
And it likes damp and dark places.

277
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,880
Chances are it's still in here
somewhere.

278
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,380
Look, don't let any of
your men get near it.

279
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,400
I can't risk anyone else
being infected.

280
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,580
How are we supposed
to contain this thing

281
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,600
when our gunfire is
completely ineffective?

282
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,700
Well, Danny's on his way down
with the flame throwers.

283
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,100
- Danny?
- He volunteered.

284
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,700
- He's keen.
- yeah, that's one way of putting it.

285
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,800
Just look at those plants.

286
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,500
Abby is so going to kill me.

287
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,000
Yep.

288
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,200
Sid? That's where you are.

289
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,000
Great, now I have to go back in.

290
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,400
This day just keeps getting better!

291
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,880
- Are you sure this is going to work?
- 100%. Come on, let's go.

292
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,880
Excuse me! Er, sorry,
who put you in charge?

293
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,600
Look, if I'm going to go in there first,
then I'm going to call the shots, all right?

294
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,980
OK, follow him, but at a distance.

295
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,880
So, look, we corner it
and then we grill it, right?

296
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,680
- Isn't that cruel?
- What?

297
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,700
Well, that thing was
a man not long ago.

298
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,380
Suppose he's still
in there somewhere?

299
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,500
OK, so we ask it nicely,
and then we grill it, right?

300
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,500
Thank you.

301
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,900
Sid!

302
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,500
What are you doing?
Stop messing about.

303
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,000
Come down from there, come on.

304
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,700
It's not funny.

305
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,300
Sid, this is not a game!

306
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,500
Dark and damp, just like I said.

307
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,900
Yeah, bingo.

308
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,000
Split into two teams.

309
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,880
Connor, get out of there now!

310
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,600
What we thought was ash was
just millions of spores.

311
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,680
It's reproducing itself. If it gets
into the ARC, we're finished.

312
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,080
- So fire won't kill it?
- Listen...

313
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,100
No, tell Danny if
he tries to burn it,

314
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,700
it's going to spread
through half of London.

315
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,000
- Sarah?
- Jenny, don't use the flame throwers.

316
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,400
I can't hear you.

317
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,100
What? You're breaking up,
I can't hear what you're saying.

318
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,680
- Anything?
- Nothing.

319
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,200
- Are you saying to go ahead?
- No! No, listen...

320
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,600
Cut off.

321
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Becker, get down here. We've got
him cornered, he's got nowhere to go.

322
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,500
It looks like someone's sneezed.

323
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,080
- Sarah?
- Ready!

324
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,680
Do not use the flame throwers!

325
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,780
- Stop!
- What?

326
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,700
Fire doesn't work.
Stay away from it.

327
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
- There it goes!
- Don't lose it!

328
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,300
We've got to drive
it upstairs, contain it.

329
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,900
David Lodge?
Have you still got that truck?

330
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,000
What is it now?

331
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Heat, it likes heat.

332
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,600
So...

333
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,600
Logically...

334
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,600
We can freeze it.

335
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,780
Sarah, we can freeze it. Turn the temperature
gauge down to as low as it will go.

336
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,680
What about you?
You'll freeze to death.

337
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,000
Do it.
I'll be fine.

338
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,600
Danny, it's gone up the stairs.

339
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,380
Has the truck arrived?
Seconds away.

340
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,000
Then what?

341
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,700
I'll get back to you.

342
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,000
For a minute, I thought he
knew what he was doing.

343
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,000
Keep going!

344
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,000
Move, move! Come on, quickly!
Whoa, whoa!

345
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,980
Come on, Connor, give us a sign.

346
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,500
It's dying.

347
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,100
Right, get him out of there.

348
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,700
Where's those blankets?
Come on!

349
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,580
- Connor?
- I'm fine.

350
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,200
Let's get a refrigerator
truck over there.

351
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,880
James,

352
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,080
OK, we've got it cornered. But there's no
chance of holding it here. It's too dangerous.

353
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,980
Listen, the longer we wait, the more
people get infected.

354
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,400
Just...

355
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,080
keep it busy until
the freezer truck arrives.

356
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,200
What do you suggest? Give it the
Financial Times to read while we wait?

357
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,980
Look, we're bringing it to the ARC.
So just get everything ready, all right?

358
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,300
No... Hello?

359
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,300
I don't believe that!

360
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,400
- I'll see you there!
- Oh, OK.

361
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,800
He's really overdoing
the Alpha male bit, isn't he?

362
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,600
Something's wrong.

363
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,400
No Sat Nav!
Show us the way to the ARC.

364
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,300
Sarah, you're on!

365
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,580
- Yes!
- It's working.

366
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,900
In a few minutes' time, this place is
going to be colder than the North Pole.

367
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,900
I hope someone's paid
the Congestion Charge.

368
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,080
You're actually enjoying
yourself, aren't you?

369
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,100
Well, you only live once.

370
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,980
Not in my case, apparently.

371
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,500
- Come again?
- Long story.

372
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,980
Well, try me.

373
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:04,100
No offence, Danny, but there was only one man
who understood and he's not here any more, so...

374
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,800
Shut up!

375
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,700
Please tell me this is
someone with a plan.

376
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,400
That's everybody out now. We're dropping
the temperature in the main room.

377
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,280
- You need to hold the creature until we're ready.
- No problem.

378
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,480
When I give the word, Danny,
release the creature.

379
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,480
We need to get it into the operations
area so we can freeze it.

380
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,600
Yeah, you make it sound so simple.

381
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,380
??? We're going to need a bit more time.
I reckon five minutes should do.

382
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,000
You've got it.

383
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,600
- What about thirty seconds?
- Huh?

384
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,000
- We've lost it.
- You what?

385
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,080
Well, on a positive note, at least
we've got it in the building.

386
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,800
??? It's definitely in here.
We just don't know where.

387
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,680
Guys, listen up, the creature's
going to be hiding somewhere dark.

388
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,480
We need to force it down this
corridor, through those doors.

389
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,200
- How do we do that?
- Freezing carbon dioxide.

390
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,680
Whatever you do,
don't let it touch you.

391
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,580
I wasn't gonna shake hands with it.
Let's find this thing!

392
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,600
Right, there's two extinguishers
in the Ops Area.

393
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,780
- The temperature is dropping, fast.
- Yeah.

394
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,300
All right, let's find these fire
extinguishers and get out of here.

395
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,700
- Where does that vent lead to?
- Back into the cooling system.

396
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:06,990
The only other access point is
through the operations room.

397
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:10,260
I think it's heading exactly
where we need it to go.

398
00:35:12,442 --> 00:35:13,463
Go ahead.

399
00:35:15,648 --> 00:35:17,702
- Danny, hi.
- Jen, good news.

400
00:35:17,827 --> 00:35:20,217
It's heading directly back to the
operations room.

401
00:35:20,821 --> 00:35:23,361
- But i'm still in here.
- Jen, get out of there.

402
00:35:23,674 --> 00:35:25,224
Get out of there now!

403
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,119
Jenny!

404
00:35:56,557 --> 00:35:58,937
Abby, stay there! It's too
dangerous!

405
00:36:10,822 --> 00:36:11,840
What's going on?

406
00:36:15,699 --> 00:36:17,585
- The creature's searching for heat.
- But it's freezing in there!

407
00:36:17,705 --> 00:36:20,015
It's jen's body heat.
It's drawing it towards her.

408
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,680
Come on!

409
00:36:40,254 --> 00:36:41,254
Jenny!

410
00:36:42,322 --> 00:36:43,322
Jenny!

411
00:36:43,841 --> 00:36:44,993
No, no, no...

412
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,960
no, no, stay on your feet, jenny!

413
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,088
Jenny!

414
00:37:01,173 --> 00:37:02,378
- It's going to kill her.
- Turn off the cold air.

415
00:37:02,498 --> 00:37:05,329
- The creature's not dead.
- Jenny's going to die if we don't!

416
00:37:15,949 --> 00:37:16,949
Give me a minute.

417
00:37:17,169 --> 00:37:18,200
Danny!

418
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:21,605
What's he doing?

419
00:37:22,481 --> 00:37:23,481
Over here!

420
00:37:30,132 --> 00:37:32,436
Come and have a go at someone your
own size!

421
00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:47,019
- It's working.
- Come on.

422
00:37:50,303 --> 00:37:52,629
The creature's freezing.
It's... it's dying.

423
00:37:58,591 --> 00:37:59,591
Go, go, go, go!

424
00:38:02,351 --> 00:38:03,387
Let's get her out of here!

425
00:38:03,507 --> 00:38:04,781
No, don't touch her!

426
00:38:04,901 --> 00:38:07,302
The only chance she's got is
if the cold kills the fungus.

427
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,680
We wait, OK?

428
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,800
Yeah.

429
00:38:19,863 --> 00:38:21,256
No!
Danny, listen to me!

430
00:38:21,376 --> 00:38:22,111
- It's killing her!
- I know.

431
00:38:22,231 --> 00:38:25,072
But if we take her out now, she'll
end up like that thing over there.

432
00:38:26,105 --> 00:38:27,925
Trust me, please.

433
00:38:33,287 --> 00:38:34,287
Come on...

434
00:38:49,821 --> 00:38:50,903
OK, OK, she's clear.

435
00:38:51,801 --> 00:38:52,801
I've got her.

436
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,350
OK.

437
00:38:55,732 --> 00:38:57,382
Bring her through here.

438
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:00,590
Take her head, take her head.

439
00:39:01,645 --> 00:39:04,647
If she's been frozen quickly, there's
a chance we can bring her back.

440
00:39:04,995 --> 00:39:05,995
Keep warming her.

441
00:39:07,374 --> 00:39:08,374
Here we go.

442
00:39:08,743 --> 00:39:09,743
Come on, jenny.

443
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,417
- Anything?
- No pulse.

444
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:21,846
Come on, jen. Come on.

445
00:39:23,217 --> 00:39:24,217
Not again.

446
00:39:25,076 --> 00:39:27,327
If she stays like this for a few
minutes, we've lost her.

447
00:39:27,447 --> 00:39:29,598
Not again. Please, not again.

448
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,299
Come on. Don't bail on us now.

449
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,003
Anything?

450
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,017
I've got a pulse.

451
00:39:47,272 --> 00:39:48,272
Yes!

452
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,170
Here she comes. Hey, hey.

453
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,300
Nick...

454
00:39:56,584 --> 00:39:59,711
he's gone. Remember?

455
00:40:07,913 --> 00:40:09,371
You can let go of my hand now.

456
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,990
Oh, sorry, sorry.

457
00:40:13,231 --> 00:40:15,279
Hey, welcome back.

458
00:40:18,033 --> 00:40:19,048
You scared us.

459
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:33,499
You all right?

460
00:40:35,485 --> 00:40:36,488
I'm fine.

461
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,700
You know, i'll never look at
athlete's foot the same way again.

462
00:40:45,096 --> 00:40:48,904
James, there's something i need to
discuss with you.

463
00:40:53,134 --> 00:40:55,485
Glad you could drop by
at such short notice.

464
00:40:55,605 --> 00:40:59,027
Now, christine, i wanted you to be
the first to know.

465
00:40:59,775 --> 00:41:00,775
You're right,

466
00:41:01,138 --> 00:41:04,568
i am going to need a man just like
captain wilder to replace cutter.

467
00:41:04,758 --> 00:41:06,986
I'm glad you've come round
to my way of thinking.

468
00:41:07,106 --> 00:41:09,724
Oh, not wilder himself, of course.
No, he's...

469
00:41:10,161 --> 00:41:12,046
playing much too vital a role
on your own staff.

470
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:15,360
But danny quinn here
is just like him.

471
00:41:15,893 --> 00:41:18,598
Background in the police, firearms
training, management skills.

472
00:41:18,932 --> 00:41:20,233
The perfect choice.

473
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:23,269
I've already
cleared it with the minister.

474
00:41:31,172 --> 00:41:32,369
Congratulations.

475
00:41:32,921 --> 00:41:35,721
I'm sure we'll be
seeing a lot of each other.

476
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,905
I trust that's all right with you?

477
00:41:46,025 --> 00:41:48,279
If it's OK with these guys,
Then it's all right with me.

478
00:41:48,399 --> 00:41:49,440
Their idea.

479
00:41:50,763 --> 00:41:52,135
Jenny, most of all.

480
00:41:53,907 --> 00:41:54,907
Um, guv...

481
00:41:57,023 --> 00:41:58,272
what's the pay?

482
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,361
Next to nothing.

483
00:42:01,321 --> 00:42:02,401
Seems fair.

484
00:42:03,596 --> 00:42:06,131
Try not to make a complete dog's
breakfast of this, won't you?

485
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,860
Where's jenny?

486
00:42:15,343 --> 00:42:18,243
Guys, is there something you're not
telling me?

487
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
What's going on?

488
00:42:27,866 --> 00:42:29,228
You can't leave.

489
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:31,577
- I have to.
- It's your team.

490
00:42:33,553 --> 00:42:34,553
No.

491
00:42:35,737 --> 00:42:38,706
It was cutter's, and now it's yours.

492
00:42:39,868 --> 00:42:42,480
- I don't belong here any more.
- Course you do.

493
00:42:42,739 --> 00:42:44,893
Danny, i died today.

494
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,571
I think i should really quit
while i'm ahead.

495
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,865
I know you, and i know all about
claudia brown.

496
00:42:52,985 --> 00:42:56,633
And i'm sure there's some perfectly
rational explanation.

497
00:42:56,753 --> 00:42:59,063
Yeah, that's what i used to think.

498
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:01,404
Maybe we've all lived other lives,

499
00:43:01,524 --> 00:43:04,938
But what's important is
who we are right now.

500
00:43:05,404 --> 00:43:07,143
You're absolutely right.

501
00:43:08,172 --> 00:43:10,275
And that's exactly why i have to go.

502
00:43:11,187 --> 00:43:12,123
Danny, if i stay here,

503
00:43:12,243 --> 00:43:14,665
I'll always be looking back,
wondering who i really am.

504
00:43:15,725 --> 00:43:19,581
I just want to go and try and forget
about the arc

505
00:43:19,701 --> 00:43:22,122
And forget about the creatures and
the anomalies.

506
00:43:22,957 --> 00:43:23,757
And most of all,

507
00:43:23,877 --> 00:43:27,877
I really want to try and forget
about nick cutter and claudia brown.

508
00:43:29,425 --> 00:43:31,544
You said it yourself, you only live
once.

509
00:43:32,307 --> 00:43:35,689
You can try to forget him, jenny,
but you never will.

510
00:43:46,798 --> 00:43:48,027
Good luck.

511
00:44:43,127 --> 00:44:44,932
Sweet dreams, guys. Eh?

512
00:44:55,386 --> 00:44:56,517
Are you living here?

513
00:45:01,122 --> 00:45:02,122
Yes.

514
00:45:02,538 --> 00:45:04,356
But it's strictly temporary.

515
00:45:04,476 --> 00:45:08,476
You know how many clauses of the health
and safety guidelines this breaches?

516
00:45:09,269 --> 00:45:10,269
Sorry.

517
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:15,876
Oh, look, i've got a small place in
the city i use during the week.

518
00:45:16,696 --> 00:45:17,696
You can um...

519
00:45:19,492 --> 00:45:20,492
stay there.

520
00:45:21,402 --> 00:45:23,102
Till you find something.

521
00:45:23,479 --> 00:45:24,009
Really?

522
00:45:24,129 --> 00:45:26,471
Yes. And connor?

523
00:45:26,616 --> 00:45:29,445
- Yes?
- Put some trousers on.

524
00:45:35,504 --> 00:45:38,013
I've got a feeling i'm going to
profoundly regret this.

525
00:45:42,065 --> 00:45:43,454

526
00:45:44,888 --> 00:45:47,310
- I don't take orders from you.
- You do now.

527
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:49,568
She knows we've got antitech.
We've got five minutes.

528
00:45:49,688 --> 00:45:51,888
I hope you know what you're doing!

529
00:45:52,913 --> 00:45:53,913
Stop!

530
00:46:01,231 --> 00:46:04,331
We're not going to give up
without a fight, are we?
