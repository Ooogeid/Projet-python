1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,262
Previously in Primeval...

2
00:00:02,408 --> 00:00:04,984
Johnson's military. We can't storm
in without clearance...

3
00:00:05,362 --> 00:00:07,322
Yes, sir. I'm very well
aware of that.

4
00:00:07,442 --> 00:00:09,842
... based on a hunch that she's got
an active anomaly

5
00:00:09,962 --> 00:00:12,943
and some mysterious woman from the
future tucked away somewhere.

6
00:00:13,202 --> 00:00:14,384
Who are you? Who do you work for?

7
00:00:14,602 --> 00:00:16,282
I'll show you.

8
00:00:16,402 --> 00:00:18,802
But first I have to go to the
Anomaly Research Centre.

9
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:20,972
What do you know about the ARC?

10
00:00:28,197 --> 00:00:30,650
If you're going to do something,
now would be a good time.

11
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:37,571
- What's it say?
- Not much.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,880
333 here... here...

13
00:00:40,925 --> 00:00:42,082
What's going on?

14
00:00:46,387 --> 00:00:48,507
Now give me the artefact
or she dies.

15
00:00:50,707 --> 00:00:51,725
No!

16
00:00:52,163 --> 00:00:54,984
- What are we going to do?
- Follow Helen. Wherever she goes.

17
00:00:55,104 --> 00:00:56,929
To the end of time if necessary.

18
00:00:57,145 --> 00:01:02,036
La Prime Team Présente :

19
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:06,198
Transcript par Chocolate

20
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,520
Resync VO : Grishnak & Darkevil

21
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:17,184
Merci d'avoir suivi cette
3e saison avec nos subs ;)

22
00:01:25,104 --> 00:01:29,104
Primeval Season 3 FINAL

23
00:02:00,076 --> 00:02:01,083
Right.

24
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:03,402
So... what have we got?

25
00:02:03,522 --> 00:02:05,010
Stun grenades.

26
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,020
Future predators have
hyper-sensitive hearing, yeah?

27
00:02:08,326 --> 00:02:10,590
These should stop them dead
in their tracks.

28
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:12,376
Got any earplugs in there?

29
00:02:12,494 --> 00:02:13,704
Use your fingers.

30
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,533
And if you don't want your eardrums
to burst,

31
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:18,664
I suggest you keep your mouth open.

32
00:02:19,188 --> 00:02:21,319
That won't be difficult for Connor.

33
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:24,744
Don't be too close
when he throws them.

34
00:02:25,505 --> 00:02:27,882
All right. Let's do this.

35
00:02:34,483 --> 00:02:36,118
No. Not now.

36
00:02:36,238 --> 00:02:38,184
It's Johnson's HQ.

37
00:02:38,463 --> 00:02:39,884
Do you think it's Helen?

38
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:41,495
It could be.

39
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,162
We go back there and we're wrong,
then, er...

40
00:02:53,443 --> 00:02:55,415
You need to make the call.

41
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,134
Right. Becker...

42
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:00,665
you check it out. Sarah, you go
with him.

43
00:03:00,785 --> 00:03:02,531
Abby, Connor, you're with me.

44
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,795
Wherever she is, we'll stop her.

45
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,672
Danny, I want to go with you.

46
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:08,814
Look, I need you to do this for me.

47
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,782
- Yeah, but what if you don't -
- Look, no-one's saying goodbye here.

48
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:13,452
We're all coming back.

49
00:03:13,749 --> 00:03:15,574
Now, once we're through...

50
00:03:15,706 --> 00:03:18,134
you close the anomaly. It's far too
dangerous to leave it open.

51
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:19,945
Unlock it in two hours.

52
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,579
Danny. Here.

53
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:23,211
And take care.

54
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:24,844
Unlock it.

55
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:27,976
- Connor.
- Yo.

56
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,925
You might need this.

57
00:03:30,045 --> 00:03:30,895
Thanks.

58
00:04:01,179 --> 00:04:02,438
Let's get going.

59
00:04:02,558 --> 00:04:03,922
What about Johnson's people?

60
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:06,085
The operation's been closed down.

61
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,754
The place should be empty. Come on.

62
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:10,111
Come on!

63
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:23,065
Doesn't get any prettier, does it?

64
00:04:23,716 --> 00:04:25,352
- You all right?
- Yeah.

65
00:04:26,845 --> 00:04:28,756
When I saw Helen,
she was down there.

66
00:04:28,876 --> 00:04:29,952
By the church.

67
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:33,140
Let's go.

68
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,283
This way.

69
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:07,352
Is it Helen?

70
00:05:21,267 --> 00:05:22,777
So... where is Helen?

71
00:05:22,897 --> 00:05:24,512
Where are all the predators?

72
00:05:40,588 --> 00:05:41,672
Listen!

73
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:11,632
Duck!

74
00:06:30,116 --> 00:06:31,606
No-one on the gate then.

75
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,389
Let's hope it's all that easy.

76
00:06:33,515 --> 00:06:35,072
I wouldn't bet on it.

77
00:06:44,074 --> 00:06:45,074
Through here.

78
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,805
This must be Johnson's anomaly.

79
00:06:54,935 --> 00:06:57,721
So, where...
where did you see Helen?

80
00:06:57,862 --> 00:06:59,112
She came from over there.

81
00:08:43,536 --> 00:08:44,536
Run!

82
00:09:02,601 --> 00:09:04,273
Throw these over the side!

83
00:09:30,972 --> 00:09:32,040
It stinks.

84
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,246
Why would Helen come here?

85
00:09:36,908 --> 00:09:40,393
If it was me, I'd just find some
nice little Jurassic beach somewhere.

86
00:09:44,327 --> 00:09:46,769
However crazy she was, everything she
does makes a kind of sense.

87
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:47,854
Really?

88
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,294
Get back!

89
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,060
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

90
00:09:59,561 --> 00:10:00,685
Did you get it?

91
00:10:02,637 --> 00:10:04,014
Apparently not.

92
00:10:06,374 --> 00:10:07,374
I can't hold it!

93
00:10:10,702 --> 00:10:13,802
We've got to get something
to keep the door closed.

94
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,807
Becker is really not going
to be happy with you.

95
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:34,463
- Why?
- That was his favourite gun.

96
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,310
We got to get him a girlfriend.

97
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:41,032
Oh, my God.

98
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:48,503
We're in the ARC.

99
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:05,773
Maybe it's some kind of...

100
00:11:05,913 --> 00:11:07,361
future version of it.

101
00:11:07,894 --> 00:11:09,651
Helen said it started in here.

102
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,879
This must be what she meant.

103
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:14,825
She's here! I know it.

104
00:11:14,972 --> 00:11:15,972
Come on.

105
00:11:37,862 --> 00:11:38,862
Come on!

106
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:53,120
Here! Quick! Quick!

107
00:12:02,206 --> 00:12:04,802
There's no way out.
Becker, there's no way out!

108
00:12:05,421 --> 00:12:07,080
I'll call the back-up team.

109
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,281
And tell them exactly where we are.

110
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,177
I think it's a bit
too late for that now.

111
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:12,092
Oh my God, they're coming through!

112
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:18,496
Right. We need to get both of them
on the grille at the same time.

113
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,382
You what?

114
00:12:19,553 --> 00:12:22,253
Come on. We've only got
one shot at this.

115
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:25,005
Come on, Sarah, you can do this.

116
00:12:30,045 --> 00:12:30,845
Come on!

117
00:12:32,076 --> 00:12:33,107
Come on.

118
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,582
Come on!

119
00:12:34,843 --> 00:12:35,843
Now!

120
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,480
Do you think that's the last one
of those things?

121
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,160
Let's go find out.

122
00:13:04,936 --> 00:13:06,405
The anomaly's closed.

123
00:13:09,115 --> 00:13:10,577
Let's get out of here.

124
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:18,828
That's what Helen used...

125
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,606
to control the anomalies.

126
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,768
It looks like it's been dead
a long time.

127
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:27,357
How do you think it works?

128
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,080
I wish I knew.

129
00:13:29,457 --> 00:13:30,483
Did you just...?

130
00:13:30,675 --> 00:13:31,675
Yeah.

131
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:42,339
Don't!

132
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,920
It works better on you than it does
on some predators.

133
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:06,017
Come out of the dark, Connor.

134
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,076
That's it.

135
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:12,525
Good boy.

136
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,269
You too, Abby.

137
00:15:20,662 --> 00:15:21,927
So you found me.

138
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,016
I must say I'm surprised.

139
00:15:25,148 --> 00:15:27,469
Surprised you had the brains
to figure it out.

140
00:15:27,697 --> 00:15:29,965
Whatever you're up to, it ends now.

141
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:32,759
Who's going to stop me?

142
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,031
You and Barbie?

143
00:15:35,663 --> 00:15:36,700
Just watch us.

144
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:51,347
Nick... knew this was important.

145
00:15:52,681 --> 00:15:54,451
But he didn't know why.

146
00:15:56,654 --> 00:15:58,184
Well, he would have done.

147
00:15:58,619 --> 00:16:00,719
If you hadn't have murdered him.

148
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:04,630
I have spent...

149
00:16:05,136 --> 00:16:06,813
every day since his death...

150
00:16:08,016 --> 00:16:09,463
working it out.

151
00:16:10,924 --> 00:16:12,115
Preparing...

152
00:16:13,068 --> 00:16:14,419
for this...

153
00:16:15,118 --> 00:16:16,037
moment.

154
00:16:17,805 --> 00:16:18,818
I know...

155
00:16:19,168 --> 00:16:20,897
he would have understood.

156
00:16:21,184 --> 00:16:23,308
You keep telling yourself that,
Helen.

157
00:16:23,627 --> 00:16:25,507
One day you might believe it.

158
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,079
It doesn't matter now.

159
00:16:32,277 --> 00:16:33,277
Soon...

160
00:16:33,903 --> 00:16:35,912
none of this will ever have
happened.

161
00:16:38,603 --> 00:16:39,761
What are you going to do?

162
00:16:39,881 --> 00:16:41,405
Oh, you're going to like this,
Connor.

163
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:45,154
I, Helen Cutter, am going
to save the world.

164
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,050
Since when did you care so much
about the human race?

165
00:16:50,486 --> 00:16:52,439
Oh, it's not humanity
I'm going to save.

166
00:16:52,987 --> 00:16:56,013
You know, Helen. You're in dire need
of some serious therapy.

167
00:17:16,224 --> 00:17:17,450
It's a time map.

168
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,275
Of every anomaly there's even been.

169
00:17:22,478 --> 00:17:23,827
Or ever will be.

170
00:17:25,274 --> 00:17:26,447
Cutter was right.

171
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:27,804
There is a pattern.

172
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:32,621
With this, we'll never have to wait for
anomalies to open again. We'll just...

173
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:34,154
know where they are.

174
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:36,696
Such a sweet, clever boy.

175
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,579
What a shame you ever met Cutter.

176
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:58,822
Gotcha.

177
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,000
You know...

178
00:18:19,496 --> 00:18:20,789
if I were you,

179
00:18:21,064 --> 00:18:23,616
I'd make the most of whatever
time you have left.

180
00:18:26,097 --> 00:18:27,207
Believe me...

181
00:18:30,073 --> 00:18:31,450
it won't be long.

182
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:34,662
Please.

183
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:36,017
No.

184
00:18:36,522 --> 00:18:37,522
Please.

185
00:18:53,856 --> 00:18:54,867
No!

186
00:19:03,355 --> 00:19:04,926
- It's time.
- Open it.

187
00:19:20,262 --> 00:19:21,584
Where are they?

188
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:28,146
Come on, Quinn. Hurry up!

189
00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:33,952
She was plotting some kind of route.

190
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:36,706
We've got to find out
where she was going.

191
00:19:36,846 --> 00:19:38,209
How we can follow her.

192
00:19:38,364 --> 00:19:40,935
But how? This thing's
completely dead.

193
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,236
I know a way.
If we can get it working, maybe

194
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:45,714
I can reconstruct the route
from the computer's memory.

195
00:19:46,782 --> 00:19:47,916
Power.

196
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:50,748
- We're going to need power.
- Yeah.

197
00:19:53,702 --> 00:19:54,710
Batteries.

198
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:55,942
In the torches.

199
00:19:56,607 --> 00:19:57,607
Brilliant.

200
00:20:00,135 --> 00:20:01,668
We'll need something to bind them
together.

201
00:20:01,793 --> 00:20:02,793
Medical kit.

202
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:04,919
How many have we got?

203
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,039
Wires...

204
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,570
Wires.

205
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:15,637
Don't we need the artefact
to make it work?

206
00:20:15,946 --> 00:20:17,177
No, no, cos...

207
00:20:17,324 --> 00:20:20,461
hopefully the data will
be still on the hard drive, so...

208
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:22,350
we might not need it.

209
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:30,079
Site 333.
She named the file Site 333.

210
00:20:30,585 --> 00:20:33,649
333. What is that? A location,
a code, what?

211
00:20:35,837 --> 00:20:37,017
Oh, my God.

212
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,142
What?

213
00:20:39,647 --> 00:20:41,516
The Rift Valley. In Africa.

214
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,118
Four million years ago.

215
00:20:43,244 --> 00:20:45,851
It's the, um... the cradle of
civilisation.

216
00:20:45,975 --> 00:20:48,389
Site 333 is where they found

217
00:20:48,522 --> 00:20:51,577
the remains of the so-called
first family of hominids.

218
00:20:52,257 --> 00:20:55,630
A group of 13 early humans
who all died at the same time.

219
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,382
- No-one ever knew how.
- So Helen's

220
00:20:58,502 --> 00:21:00,579
gone to visit the ape men?
Wha...?

221
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:02,525
No.

222
00:21:03,174 --> 00:21:04,806
She's gone to kill the first human.

223
00:21:05,007 --> 00:21:07,171
To stop our evolution in its tracks.

224
00:21:08,373 --> 00:21:10,052
She's going to wipe us all out.

225
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,005
- I'm not getting it.
- All right, I'm on it.

226
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,159
Try lower.

227
00:21:28,523 --> 00:21:29,523
Come on.

228
00:21:30,138 --> 00:21:31,719
Yeah, that's good. That's got it.

229
00:21:33,306 --> 00:21:34,306
Here we go.

230
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,122
This is not as easy as it looks,
you know.

231
00:21:37,282 --> 00:21:39,360
<i>Just get on with it.</i>

232
00:21:52,762 --> 00:21:54,548
This will only give us
a small window of time.

233
00:21:55,054 --> 00:21:55,922
All right.

234
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,442
You ready?

235
00:21:57,631 --> 00:21:58,482
Not really.

236
00:22:01,495 --> 00:22:02,600
That's it!

237
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,520
I've got to remember everything...
that she did.

238
00:22:38,443 --> 00:22:39,680
Come on!

239
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,602
So...

240
00:22:41,414 --> 00:22:42,553
333.

241
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:48,487
This is Helen's route. It looks like
she was going through two anomalies.

242
00:22:48,923 --> 00:22:50,679
We have to find a way to open them.

243
00:22:54,508 --> 00:22:55,482
Let's do it.

244
00:22:58,084 --> 00:22:59,240
Shut the connector.

245
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,400
Right.

246
00:23:02,704 --> 00:23:04,622
Just be patient, Connor.
You'll get it.

247
00:23:05,745 --> 00:23:06,995
Concentrate.

248
00:23:10,564 --> 00:23:11,576
Guys!

249
00:23:14,162 --> 00:23:15,230
Predators.

250
00:23:16,201 --> 00:23:17,934
Just hurry up, all right?

251
00:23:18,054 --> 00:23:20,106
Ohhh... I'm not very good
with pressure.

252
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,982
OK, come on.

253
00:23:22,895 --> 00:23:23,895
She...

254
00:23:24,414 --> 00:23:27,071
put in a series of numbers.
That could be anything. I mean...

255
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,216
It's like some kind of lettering.

256
00:23:31,855 --> 00:23:34,384
No. It's a... it's a sequence
of numbers.

257
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:36,680
- OK, some kind of code?
- Yeah, but to what?

258
00:23:37,443 --> 00:23:39,678
653... 59.

259
00:23:40,998 --> 00:23:42,098
I've got it.

260
00:23:42,703 --> 00:23:43,920
Please let this work.

261
00:23:44,503 --> 00:23:45,503
6...

262
00:23:46,163 --> 00:23:47,052
5...

263
00:23:47,172 --> 00:23:49,366
3,5,9.

264
00:23:51,111 --> 00:23:52,111
Yes!

265
00:23:52,871 --> 00:23:53,951
Sorry.

266
00:23:54,844 --> 00:23:55,944
Come on.

267
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,920
Nearly there. Come on. Come on.

268
00:24:01,697 --> 00:24:04,240
This is taking too long. We're going
to run out of power.

269
00:24:06,241 --> 00:24:07,241
Hurry up, Connor.

270
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:09,082
I can only go as fast as it's
downloading.

271
00:24:09,246 --> 00:24:11,200
You've got to get it open, Connor.

272
00:24:11,332 --> 00:24:12,800
Tell me something I don't know.

273
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,077
OK, 75 percent.

274
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,418
It's getting there.

275
00:24:20,233 --> 00:24:21,560
Come on.

276
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,818
80 percent.

277
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,384
They're in here.

278
00:24:25,634 --> 00:24:26,684
95 percent.

279
00:24:28,578 --> 00:24:30,252
100 percent. That's it!

280
00:24:32,885 --> 00:24:34,066
I've got it.

281
00:24:34,572 --> 00:24:36,679
This is it... Go.

282
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:49,973
- Close it!
- Close it!

283
00:24:54,686 --> 00:24:56,243
I didn't doubt you for a second.

284
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,122
Right.

285
00:25:04,887 --> 00:25:05,899
So...

286
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:07,962
Where are we now?

287
00:25:08,166 --> 00:25:09,800
More importantly...

288
00:25:09,965 --> 00:25:11,640
where's Helen?

289
00:25:12,312 --> 00:25:13,460
Boots.

290
00:25:19,866 --> 00:25:21,131
She went this way.

291
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:21,882
Yeah.

292
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,495
Ancient pines... that could mean
this is...

293
00:25:28,677 --> 00:25:30,381
Jurassic or...

294
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:32,120
maybe...

295
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,281
Maybe Cretaceous.

296
00:25:39,377 --> 00:25:40,480
So, er...

297
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,812
what sort of creatures
are we talking about?

298
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:45,080
Oh... well...

299
00:25:46,459 --> 00:25:48,000
- A lot.
- Really?

300
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,013
Too many to list.

301
00:25:50,767 --> 00:25:53,970
A lot of theropod dinosaurs,
mostly carnivores, I mean.

302
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,000
Spinosaurus, halasaurus,

303
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,568
avertasaurus, napasaurus.

304
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:04,482
Oh, good.

305
00:26:04,868 --> 00:26:06,416
- Obviously T-Rex.
- Yeah.

306
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:08,016
- Raptors.
- Yeah, I got the point.

307
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,716
No, literally...

308
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:11,444
raptors.

309
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:26,397
They don't look too bad.

310
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,378
Run!

311
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:04,640
Abby, this way!

312
00:27:06,161 --> 00:27:07,161
Quickly!

313
00:27:08,116 --> 00:27:09,815
Come on! This way!

314
00:27:18,688 --> 00:27:20,486
Get off! Get off!

315
00:27:24,956 --> 00:27:26,999
Yeah, I'm OK, I'm good.

316
00:27:32,383 --> 00:27:34,224
- Get off!
- That was close.

317
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:40,941
Well, they're juvenile raptors, so

318
00:27:41,082 --> 00:27:43,200
at least we know we're in
the Cretaceous.

319
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,866
We've got to find the next anomaly.

320
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,519
Will they know how to climb?

321
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,860
No.

322
00:27:48,605 --> 00:27:49,369
No!

323
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,265
What?

324
00:27:53,244 --> 00:27:55,255
- The thing's just died I think.
- What?

325
00:27:55,575 --> 00:27:56,310
Yeah.

326
00:27:57,826 --> 00:27:59,032
We don't know the route.

327
00:27:59,443 --> 00:28:01,280
We can't open the anomalies.

328
00:28:01,896 --> 00:28:03,320
We can't get home.

329
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:06,240
There might not be a home
to get back to.

330
00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:12,124
Bingo.

331
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:14,737
There.

332
00:28:14,924 --> 00:28:15,924
See her?

333
00:28:16,367 --> 00:28:17,082
Yeah.

334
00:28:18,118 --> 00:28:21,071
If she gets through another anomaly,
though, we've lost her.

335
00:28:23,548 --> 00:28:24,640
Any ideas?

336
00:28:27,341 --> 00:28:29,560
We could, ah... appeal to their
better nature.

337
00:28:30,965 --> 00:28:32,398
I don't know if they've got one.

338
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:34,516
Right. Playtime's over.

339
00:28:34,676 --> 00:28:35,602
Stun grenade.

340
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,832
- Come on!
- Oh, I was about to think of that.

341
00:28:37,964 --> 00:28:39,701
- Where is it?
- In the bag.

342
00:28:40,564 --> 00:28:41,600
Got it.

343
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,220
Here you are, Danny.

344
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:47,520
Cover your ears.

345
00:28:48,024 --> 00:28:49,825
- And open your mouth.
- Two...

346
00:28:50,107 --> 00:28:52,807
- One...
- Hang on. He said not to be too -

347
00:29:16,935 --> 00:29:18,045
Watch your foot.

348
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,641
Connor! Connor, are you OK?

349
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:25,000
He's alive.

350
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:27,120
He's alive.

351
00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:17,442
Go.

352
00:30:17,603 --> 00:30:19,036
I can't leave here. I won't.

353
00:30:19,204 --> 00:30:21,280
You have to stop her!

354
00:30:23,685 --> 00:30:24,682
Let's get him somewhere safe.

355
00:30:24,842 --> 00:30:25,842
Finish it!

356
00:30:39,352 --> 00:30:40,615
Wake up, Connor!

357
00:31:37,254 --> 00:31:38,758
Can you hear me?

358
00:31:39,436 --> 00:31:40,880
Just say something!

359
00:31:42,345 --> 00:31:44,593
Oh, come on, don't give up
on me now.

360
00:31:45,482 --> 00:31:46,482
Please!

361
00:31:47,013 --> 00:31:48,067
Please.

362
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:50,233
Just...

363
00:32:22,097 --> 00:32:23,340
Well, then.

364
00:32:25,567 --> 00:32:27,043
Come on then.

365
00:32:27,773 --> 00:32:29,038
This way.

366
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,581
Why don't you pick on someone
your own... species?

367
00:32:43,626 --> 00:32:44,960
I'm going to save you this time.

368
00:32:45,116 --> 00:32:47,539
That's really... sweet of you, Abby,
but I think...

369
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,434
I've got it covered.

370
00:32:50,626 --> 00:32:52,185
- How?
- I don't know.

371
00:32:52,916 --> 00:32:54,121
But I'm sure I'll think of
something.

372
00:32:54,261 --> 00:32:56,068
You're kind of in no state to...

373
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:57,262
do anything right now.

374
00:32:57,423 --> 00:32:58,605
Abby, can you just...?

375
00:32:58,725 --> 00:32:59,382
What?

376
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,300
Can we argue about this later?

377
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,400
Yeah?

378
00:33:07,591 --> 00:33:09,207
That was a stupid idea.
I've just aggravated him.

379
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,142
Nice hit.

380
00:33:20,656 --> 00:33:21,724
Thank you.

381
00:33:22,438 --> 00:33:23,830
Let's go, though, before...

382
00:33:24,026 --> 00:33:25,261
the others wake up.

383
00:33:26,223 --> 00:33:27,340
Oh yeah...

384
00:33:27,577 --> 00:33:29,100
- Cool.
- Come on.

385
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,740
- Abby.
- What?

386
00:33:31,348 --> 00:33:33,175
- A little bit of help?
- Sorry.

387
00:33:36,744 --> 00:33:38,346
I think I broke my ankle.

388
00:33:38,486 --> 00:33:39,540
Oh, really?

389
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,269
If not, it's a bad sprain.

390
00:33:45,459 --> 00:33:46,620
Are you OK?

391
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:00,780
We just need to find somewhere
safe then...

392
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:02,940
Then we can find Danny
in the morning.

393
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:24,584
You're too late, Danny!

394
00:37:24,704 --> 00:37:26,018
It's already begun.

395
00:37:26,555 --> 00:37:27,680
But thanks.

396
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,717
You know, if you hadn't taken me
to the ARC,

397
00:37:29,837 --> 00:37:31,300
I never would have got this far.

398
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:33,093
You killed them!

399
00:37:33,825 --> 00:37:36,607
Humanity is a stain upon the face
of the planet.

400
00:37:37,218 --> 00:37:38,878
And when we're gone,

401
00:37:39,061 --> 00:37:41,260
other species will be able
to develop in peace.

402
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:44,586
There'll be no war, no pollution.

403
00:37:44,923 --> 00:37:46,216
No predators.

404
00:37:46,413 --> 00:37:47,425
So...

405
00:37:47,996 --> 00:37:49,780
if you wiped out humanity,

406
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:51,860
then how come I'm still here?

407
00:37:52,265 --> 00:37:55,115
You're really not very bright,
are you, Danny?

408
00:37:58,649 --> 00:38:00,799
You know, I haven't finished yet.

409
00:38:01,676 --> 00:38:02,861
There's more to kill.

410
00:38:04,068 --> 00:38:07,286
But you'd be surprised how few
hominids started the human race.

411
00:38:08,558 --> 00:38:09,901
It won't take long.

412
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,613
Can you kill yourself as well?

413
00:38:13,856 --> 00:38:15,006
I don't care.

414
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:27,100
Whatever you do, humanity
will find a way to evolve.

415
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:29,481
You can't fight nature.

416
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,285
You sound just like Nick.

417
00:38:31,786 --> 00:38:33,064
And you know what?

418
00:38:34,267 --> 00:38:35,417
You're both wrong.

419
00:38:37,862 --> 00:38:38,908
Bye, Danny.

420
00:39:12,555 --> 00:39:13,635
Good boy.

421
00:39:35,102 --> 00:39:37,202
I think we'll be safe here, Connor.

422
00:39:37,385 --> 00:39:38,338
And then...

423
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:41,420
like I said, we can... find Danny
in the morning.

424
00:39:48,342 --> 00:39:49,427
What hurts?

425
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:53,685
Pretty much everything.

426
00:39:59,065 --> 00:40:00,365
Close your eyes.

427
00:40:02,637 --> 00:40:04,081
Close your eyes.

428
00:40:08,504 --> 00:40:10,340
Imagine a happy place.

429
00:40:13,256 --> 00:40:14,945
You're on a beautiful beach.

430
00:40:17,741 --> 00:40:19,547
And the sun is shining.

431
00:40:19,914 --> 00:40:21,260
Are you there too?

432
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,028
Yeah.

433
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:24,930
If you like.

434
00:40:26,428 --> 00:40:27,882
Are you wearing a bikini?

435
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:32,407
Yes.

436
00:40:33,874 --> 00:40:35,220
If you like.

437
00:40:35,748 --> 00:40:37,559
The water's really warm.

438
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:40,578
Lovely.

439
00:40:41,173 --> 00:40:42,260
Yeah.

440
00:40:51,065 --> 00:40:53,355
Can I move back into the flat,
please?

441
00:40:58,259 --> 00:40:59,341
Yeah.

442
00:41:11,521 --> 00:41:12,960
Sweet dreams.

443
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,040
See you in the morning.

444
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:24,599
Hopefully.

445
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,103
What are we going to do?

446
00:41:40,753 --> 00:41:41,877
They'll be back.

447
00:41:48,265 --> 00:41:49,558
I've got an idea.

448
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,070
Right.

449
00:42:37,363 --> 00:42:39,320
Which way home?

450
00:43:04,846 --> 00:43:06,447
Hold on! No!

451
00:43:06,855 --> 00:43:08,077
Nooo!

452
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,700
No!

453
00:43:27,461 --> 00:43:30,510
