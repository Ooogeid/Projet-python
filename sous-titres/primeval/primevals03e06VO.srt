1
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:29,527
It seems the prime minister
is promising peace in our time

2
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:31,951
Guys listen to this

3
00:00:32,798 --> 00:00:34,269
There is no one left

4
00:00:34,936 --> 00:00:36,213
The others are all dead

5
00:00:37,012 --> 00:00:39,074
God help me, is happening again

6
00:00:39,825 --> 00:00:40,886
They're here

7
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:44,380
That's how's ends

8
00:00:44,415 --> 00:00:45,622
Who's here?

9
00:00:49,204 --> 00:00:50,326
Sorry

10
00:00:57,137 --> 00:00:58,211
They found us

11
00:00:58,246 --> 00:00:59,285
Get my back

12
00:01:00,106 --> 00:01:01,496
Let's go

13
00:01:01,927 --> 00:01:02,994
Let's go

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,500
addic7ed.com presents

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,500
Primeval S03E06

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,500
Completed by aydin1954

17
00:02:34,537 --> 00:02:35,508
Bang!

18
00:02:39,696 --> 00:02:41,997
24 seconds, congratulations

19
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:44,514
That's 3 seconds longer than last time

20
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:45,784
How did you get in?

21
00:02:45,785 --> 00:02:46,670
Car park, ventilation system

22
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:49,472
- I suggest you...
- Check all...

23
00:02:49,507 --> 00:02:52,005
Infrared systems are tamper proof

24
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,250
And secure all ventilation shafts

25
00:02:53,285 --> 00:02:54,371
Exactly.

26
00:02:59,664 --> 00:03:00,953
What are they doing?

27
00:03:02,781 --> 00:03:04,267
Checking security.

28
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,614
Not very well, apparently.

29
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:09,831
They have no idea we are watching them.

30
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:17,941
- What is this?
- Please do not touch anything.

31
00:03:17,976 --> 00:03:20,756
- I do not want you to change my settings
- Sorry

32
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:23,565
You know... wha-what are you doing?

33
00:03:28,164 --> 00:03:30,784
You can come out. I'm seen by the management view

34
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:32,848
whatever that you are.

35
00:03:33,436 --> 00:03:35,522
It's OK.
I don't think he saw us

36
00:03:36,336 --> 00:03:38,340
We are flatmates,
why-why he cannot see us?

37
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,365
We are not flatmates.

38
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,278
And if I ever find your socks in
the bread maker again...

39
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:44,735
You are fired!

40
00:03:46,577 --> 00:03:47,795
Keeping them warm

41
00:03:51,496 --> 00:03:52,515
Connor!

42
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:03,707
- Oh, hello!
- These papers were classified!

43
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,146
Probably going to shred them anyway then

44
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,956
This arengement...

45
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:10,731
is not working

46
00:04:14,703 --> 00:04:15,816
I really don't want to hurt you

47
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:17,188
You're all talk

48
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:26,936
Careful.

49
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,968
Him? What about me?

50
00:04:29,385 --> 00:04:31,106
He's more valuable than you

51
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:33,004
- How valuable?
- Priceless.

52
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,512
You know I got to go

53
00:04:35,718 --> 00:04:36,962
What you're doing today?

54
00:04:37,415 --> 00:04:38,457
Ah, this and that.

55
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,194
She is going out we're on.

56
00:04:49,017 --> 00:04:50,112
Get closer.

57
00:04:52,275 --> 00:04:54,436
It is. The artifact.

58
00:04:54,672 --> 00:04:56,894
They've cleaned it up.
I knew it.

59
00:04:57,786 --> 00:04:59,272
They had it all the time.

60
00:04:59,874 --> 00:05:01,953
I'm assuming no luck
on the X-ray analysis?

61
00:05:01,988 --> 00:05:03,998
Well it only confirmed
what we alredy knew.

62
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:06,529
No closer to find
what it actully does

63
00:05:06,564 --> 00:05:07,641
No.

64
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:14,288
Light.

65
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:17,033
Light.

66
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:20,474
Light! Connor, you've got it!

67
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:24,891
You... found it.
You got it. You... are a genius.

68
00:05:26,308 --> 00:05:27,318
I know.

69
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:31,043
What I've done?

70
00:05:32,657 --> 00:05:35,278
Hm, I'm going to enjoy this.
Get the minister on the phone.

71
00:05:35,313 --> 00:05:36,070
Yes mam'.

72
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,898
So you think the laser may unluck it?

73
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,381
Ah, try diffusing the beam.

74
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:45,499
Good idea.

75
00:05:46,223 --> 00:05:47,167
Allright.

76
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:49,063
- Diffused
- Fully?

77
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:49,980
Yep.

78
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:53,380
Didn't leave the instruction manual
in the box, won't you?

79
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:56,544
- Ahm, try another angle.
- Angle, OK.

80
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,863
- See anything?
- Nope.

81
00:06:02,065 --> 00:06:03,317
- How about now?
- No.

82
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,272
- How about now?
- Is not working.

83
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:09,661
- How about now?
- Connor, is not working.

84
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:11,407
It's got nothin to do with the light
our call is wrong.

85
00:06:11,442 --> 00:06:14,131
We can't just give up, we have to keep trying
there got to be something within...

86
00:06:27,462 --> 00:06:30,394
- Connor, did you see that?
- That was like... incredible

87
00:06:30,744 --> 00:06:32,521
Was that some kind of a map?

88
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:34,298
The points where the lines are crossing,
looked exactly like...

89
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:36,432
Cutter's research model! He knew...

90
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:38,643
Cutter knew.

91
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:41,653
This is some kind of...
I don't know a key to...

92
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,342
Predicting anomalies.

93
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:46,539
Whatever we did,
We have to do it again.

94
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:47,320
OK.

95
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:49,489
What did you do?

96
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:52,577
Not 100% sure.

97
00:06:53,816 --> 00:06:55,292
Well, well.

98
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:57,641
The artefact predicts anomalies.

99
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,854
What you wanna do?

100
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:05,963
Talk with the minister, I'll phone him on the way.
We are going in.

101
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:12,424
I am satisfied there was no serious breach of security

102
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:13,601
Excellent.

103
00:07:13,884 --> 00:07:15,045
A new definition of "serious".

104
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,736
You left him upsail in the ventilation shaft

105
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,019
Yes sir.

106
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:22,212
That surveliance camera is a waste of time by the way

107
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,197
What cam?

108
00:07:23,232 --> 00:07:24,642
The one on the shaft,
covering the corridor.

109
00:07:24,677 --> 00:07:25,910
There is no camera there.

110
00:07:29,426 --> 00:07:30,731
Am I missing something?

111
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:37,975
Vents.

112
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:42,036
- Anything?
- Clear. You?

113
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:48,072
Smile boys, we are on TV.

114
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:49,336
How is going?

115
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,879
Ehm, we just opened the artifact.

116
00:07:51,914 --> 00:07:52,743
Connor!

117
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,979
Yo!

118
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:55,777
- They have seen it.
- They have seen what?

119
00:07:55,812 --> 00:07:58,819
Johnson, she knows we got the
artifact. We got 5 minutes.

120
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:00,897
- Get my bag.
- Security lockdown.

121
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:02,066
Secure the main gate.

122
00:08:02,584 --> 00:08:04,685
- Go!
- Closing the main gate.

123
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:06,729
Wait, stop!

124
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,836
She is already here.
All exits are covered.

125
00:08:10,871 --> 00:08:13,522
- Find the crim and the artifact!
- Let's go! Move, move.

126
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:17,498
- Move, move.

127
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:19,925
I know one exit
she hasn't got covered.

128
00:08:21,528 --> 00:08:23,324
Lester is lookin for a safe place.

129
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:25,709
Whatever you do,
don't break cover.

130
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:27,517
We'll find you when is clear.

131
00:08:32,587 --> 00:08:34,154
Stop there, drop your weapons!

132
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:37,154
No sir, you drop yours.

133
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:43,308
We really don't want to kill you...
sir.

134
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:46,668
So, mate, with fuel injection,
it's rather like osmosis -

135
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:50,308
a solvent passes through
a semi-permeable membrane
to form an equilibrium. Yes?

136
00:08:54,828 --> 00:08:58,068
Put your weapon down, Becker,
and surrender the artefact.

137
00:08:58,068 --> 00:09:01,308
With respect, I don't take orders
from you.

138
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,948
You do now.

139
00:09:06,668 --> 00:09:08,868
Danny, I hope you know
what you're doing.

140
00:09:17,508 --> 00:09:20,268
The Minister isn't in?
Did you tell him it was me?

141
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,828
I'm afraid he won't be taking
your call, James.

142
00:09:23,828 --> 00:09:25,788
You've been a bad boy!

143
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:34,610
They're still on our tail, Danny.
Danny, what are we going to do?

144
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,810
Hold on tight.
This could get a bit lively.

145
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,410
Danny?

146
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,370
Stay in line. Keep your hands
where we can see them.

147
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,330
Keep it moving!

148
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,090
Sorry, ma'am... They got away.

149
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,770
Well, don't just stand there.
Find them.

150
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,930
Tell me where they've gone.
No idea.

151
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:26,370
You know what freelance staff are
like - always popping in and out.

152
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,490
You can't protect them for long.

153
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,090
The truth is, you can't do much of
anything any more.

154
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,850
Oh, and you're in my chair!

155
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,370
You know, this isn't over, Christine.

156
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,010
When people say that, James,...
it usually is.

157
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:03,450
Ladies and gentlemen, James Lester
has been relieved of his duties.

158
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:10,770
Please continue working normally and
this transition will run smoothly.

159
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,570
The ARC.

160
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,330
At least we know where we're going.
Get rid of your mobiles.

161
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,850
I've just signed
a new 18-month contract.

162
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,850
They can trace it.

163
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,330
You do realise this isn't personal,
Captain?

164
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,490
It's purely a question of
national security.

165
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,970
Of course, ma'am.

166
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,930
I've looked at your file, Becker.

167
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,690
You're a good soldier.

168
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,770
I am your commanding officer now.

169
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,170
I assume
there is no conflict of loyalties?

170
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,570
None at all.

171
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:17,290
Find me the artefact...and you're
looking at a very rapid promotion.

172
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,370
I'll do my best.

173
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,130
I'll raise you 300.
Pass.

174
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,210
Don't want to play with
the big boys? I'm out as well.

175
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,050
Cool lizard.
What? Oh yeah, very rare.

176
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,050
Just like this hand. I'm all in.

177
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,570
I call.

178
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,730
Something tells me this safe house
hasn't been used for years.

179
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,570
Thanks a lot, Lester.
This place looks terrific (!)

180
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,530
It was never going to be a four-star
hotel, was it?

181
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,770
Is it locked?
Yeah.

182
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,250
Leave this to me.

183
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,650
The only part of being a copper
I enjoyed.

184
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,290
Come on.

185
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,290
Wow!

186
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,850
Urgh...

187
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,690
Chateau Lafite. Not a bad vintage.
Why, is that worth much?

188
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,890
About £1,000.

189
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:03,090
There's no power.

190
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,450
It'll be like Christmas
at my gran's. (LAUGHS)

191
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:08,490
Please, God,
nobody mention charades!

192
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,210
I'm going to get some wood
for the fire.

193
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,810
Argh!

194
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,770
That hurt.

195
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,210
Huh! Oh, no!

196
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,410
That's just wrong!

197
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,090
This trip wire will act as
an early-warning system.

198
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,650
How long do you reckon
we should wait here?

199
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,610
As long as it takes.

200
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,050
We haven't got any food.

201
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,530
Oh, er...found them in the car.

202
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,730
They're going to find us,
aren't they?

203
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,690
It's just a matter of time.

204
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,770
But we're not going to give up
without a fight, are we, eh?

205
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,730
No.
Come on.

206
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,130
It's like they thought they were
coming back at any minute.

207
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,450
Oh...

208
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,090
Right, let's see if you still work.

209
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,290
Hey.
Probably past its sell-by date.

210
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:33,290
Brilliant. Corned beef. I love it.
Corned beef...

211
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,250
Abby!

212
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,330
Aren't they beautiful!
Wow!

213
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,090
Whoa!

214
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,210
Hello, hello, this is Connor Temple.

215
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,650
Is anybody receiving me? Over.

216
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,210
Hello?

217
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,570
Hm...

218
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,810
Get it off me!
What are you doing?

219
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,290
Argh! Huh!

220
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:54,410
Urgh!

221
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:58,690
What? I just opened the door
and it fell out on me.

222
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,210
He must have got trapped inside.

223
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,570
It looks like
some sort of viewing room.

224
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,810
It's a diary.

225
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,370
It's written in some sort of code.

226
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,970
Can you crack it?
Of course I can.

227
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,290
What happened here?
Where did they all go?

228
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:33,250
You're cleaned out, Jackie!
Come on!

229
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,490
One of you can afford to sub me.
Sorry, mate.

230
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,770
I'll bet the lizard against
whatever you've got.

231
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,450
It's worth a fortune. Abby told me.

232
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,290
All right. The lizard.

233
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:00,610
# When the little bluebird
who has never said a word

234
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,850
# Starts to sing "Spring! Spring!"

235
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,810
# And the little bluebell
At the bottom of the dell

236
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,890
# Starts to ring "Ding! Ding!"...

237
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,850
Abby?

238
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:16,970
# Sings a tune to the moon above

239
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:21,170
# It is nature, that's all,
simply telling us to fall in love

240
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:29,090
# In old Amsterdam...

241
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,250
# Argentines, without...

242
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,570
Guys, listen to this.

243
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,130
"There's no-one left.

244
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,450
The others are all dead.

245
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,810
God help me, it's happening again.

246
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,450
They're here."

247
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,890
And that's where it ends.

248
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,650
Who's here?

249
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,610
It's an anomaly!

250
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,370
Does Quinn have access to
a detector?

251
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,730
No. There's no way they can know
about the anomaly.

252
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,810
Then my men can cover it.
You stay here.

253
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,290
It was written by
a Professor John Morton.

254
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,130
He was a military scientist

255
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,650
who came here with his team to do
meteorological tests,

256
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,090
but then something happened.

257
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,650
They found something in the woods,
but Morton doesn't say what.

258
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,370
That sounds like some kind of
bird's distress call.

259
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,970
But what type of bird
would make that sound?

260
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,890
I don't know.

261
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,930
It's the trip wire.
Have they found us?

262
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,330
Get them out the back!
Come on, let's go.

263
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,250
I'll catch you up.
Abby. Go!

264
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,210
Hide in the bunker.

265
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,770
An anomaly.
Let's get to the car.

266
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,610
Danny! Run!

267
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,090
That Lafite was worth
£1,000 a a bottle!

268
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,210
I think it was corked anyway.
Forget that. Get to the car!

269
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,650
OK, OK.

270
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,810
Get in the car!
Get in the car, it's a creature!

271
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,610
Come on!

272
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,370
Go go go go!

273
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,210
Where's it gone?

274
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,730
Look out!

275
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,570
Are you OK?
Yeah.

276
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:33,090
I can't see him.

277
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,530
Connor, drive faster!
Put your foot down!

278
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,490
Brace yourselves!

279
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,410
Oh, my god,
I think I've killed Danny!

280
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,010
Danny!
Danny!

281
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,690
Whoo!
Yes! Whoo hoo!

282
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:47,050
Well done, mate!

283
00:25:02,314 --> 00:25:04,674
Are you all right?
I'm OK, I'm OK, I'm OK.

284
00:25:04,674 --> 00:25:06,514
Good girl.
Connor...

285
00:25:06,514 --> 00:25:09,474
Connor.
Are you all right, Connor?

286
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,074
Put your back against there.

287
00:25:11,994 --> 00:25:13,354
Are you all right?
Yeah.

288
00:25:13,354 --> 00:25:16,554
Connor, speak to me.
DISTANT WAIL

289
00:25:16,554 --> 00:25:20,194
It's coming back... Abby. Abby!

290
00:25:20,194 --> 00:25:22,194
What?
Listen to me. Listen.

291
00:25:22,194 --> 00:25:24,274
We can never outrun it. OK?

292
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:27,474
You two get back to the lodge.
It's the only place we might be safe.

293
00:25:27,474 --> 00:25:29,594
I'll look after him, I promise.
All right?

294
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:30,994
Now go! Go go!

295
00:25:30,994 --> 00:25:32,954
Connor!
Come on!

296
00:25:47,594 --> 00:25:51,674
Over there. Check it out.
I'll secure the area.

297
00:26:03,994 --> 00:26:05,954
Ow!

298
00:26:20,874 --> 00:26:22,874
Close the door quietly.

299
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:27,234
(Where are you?)
I'm up here.

300
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:32,954
What are you doing up there?
What do you think I'm doing up here?

301
00:26:32,954 --> 00:26:38,154
I don't know. Kind of why I asked.
Where's the bird?

302
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:43,274
Close-ish. So keep your voice down.

303
00:26:43,274 --> 00:26:45,874
Sorry.

304
00:26:45,874 --> 00:26:47,954
What are we going to do?

305
00:26:47,954 --> 00:26:50,594
We're going to trap it.
Brilliant.

306
00:26:51,954 --> 00:26:55,034
How are we going to do that?

307
00:26:55,034 --> 00:26:58,114
Cool.

308
00:26:58,114 --> 00:27:02,514
So what do you want ME to do?
Just stay down there and look tasty.

309
00:27:02,514 --> 00:27:04,594
You what?

310
00:27:06,994 --> 00:27:08,794
You're the bait.

311
00:27:11,634 --> 00:27:13,794
I know it's this way.

312
00:27:13,794 --> 00:27:15,074
Urgh!

313
00:27:15,074 --> 00:27:19,314
Great for dancing.
Not so good for cross-country.

314
00:27:29,794 --> 00:27:32,874
Are you sure this is going to work?
How can it fail?

315
00:27:32,874 --> 00:27:35,394
Only in about 100 different ways.

316
00:27:35,394 --> 00:27:39,834
Come on. Where are you?

317
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:45,714
Maybe, maybe we scared it away.
Maybe...maybe it's just frightened.

318
00:27:49,514 --> 00:27:52,114
Not frightened enough.
Get back in the car.

319
00:27:52,114 --> 00:27:54,354
Get back in the car!

320
00:28:30,874 --> 00:28:33,114
Come on, come on!
Danny!

321
00:28:33,114 --> 00:28:34,874
Come on, come on!

322
00:28:42,994 --> 00:28:47,874
Connor! Get out of there!
OK, I'm getting out!

323
00:29:00,434 --> 00:29:03,234
There's more of them.

324
00:29:09,034 --> 00:29:11,034
Quick, hide!

325
00:29:33,634 --> 00:29:35,914
I think they've gone.

326
00:29:46,594 --> 00:29:48,794
Oh, my god!

327
00:29:48,794 --> 00:29:50,394
ROARS

328
00:29:50,394 --> 00:29:51,874
Run!

329
00:30:03,194 --> 00:30:05,554
What?
Look.

330
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:09,594
Watch where you put your feet.
Good advice... Thanks.

331
00:30:13,434 --> 00:30:16,394
Watch out! Look out!

332
00:30:16,394 --> 00:30:20,874
Danny!
Whoa! Whoa! Stop!

333
00:30:20,874 --> 00:30:24,514
It's a minefield.

334
00:30:24,514 --> 00:30:26,994
How was your hopscotch at school?
Pretty good.

335
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:29,274
Come on! Come on!
Come on, come on, come on!

336
00:30:29,274 --> 00:30:31,594
Watch out!

337
00:30:31,594 --> 00:30:34,794
Come on!
Quick, girls, please, quickly!

338
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:37,754
Give me your hand!
Let's go!

339
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:42,154
Go to the lodge!

340
00:31:05,034 --> 00:31:07,274
Stay where you are,
you're under arrest!

341
00:31:11,314 --> 00:31:13,154
What was the explosion?
A creature.

342
00:31:13,154 --> 00:31:15,914
Get us out of here!
Mate, there is more of them.

343
00:31:15,914 --> 00:31:18,354
All in good time.
Trust me, we need to hurry.

344
00:31:18,354 --> 00:31:21,634
Shut up!

345
00:31:23,794 --> 00:31:26,314
What are you looking at?

346
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:37,074
Connor!

347
00:31:55,754 --> 00:31:57,674
Connor!
Abby, come on!

348
00:32:12,674 --> 00:32:14,994
Danny.
All right.

349
00:32:22,154 --> 00:32:24,474
What happened?
Where's the artefact?

350
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:27,234
Let me handle this.
I know how Quinn's mind works.

351
00:32:28,234 --> 00:32:30,314
Fine. Do it.

352
00:32:30,314 --> 00:32:32,314
Shouldn't we report this
to the Minister?

353
00:32:32,314 --> 00:32:34,914
Lester kept him informed
on operational decisions.

354
00:32:34,914 --> 00:32:37,994
Let ME worry about him. He'll find
out what I choose to tell him.

355
00:32:37,994 --> 00:32:41,234
With respect, ma'am, if he discovers
he's not being fully informed...

356
00:32:41,234 --> 00:32:44,754
The Minister is an imbecile.
He can barely blow his own nose.

357
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,234
Do you think I'm going to let
a Whitehall glove puppet

358
00:32:47,234 --> 00:32:50,194
with the IQ of a root vegetable
tell me how to do my job?

359
00:32:50,194 --> 00:32:52,394
Now find Quinn for me.

360
00:32:58,274 --> 00:33:02,634
You never know, maybe the explosions
just scared them all off.

361
00:33:02,634 --> 00:33:05,074
More likely they'll be gathering
somewhere

362
00:33:05,074 --> 00:33:08,754
like hyenas preparing to steal
a kill.

363
00:33:13,274 --> 00:33:17,554
Looks like tea break's over.

364
00:33:31,514 --> 00:33:33,634
Abby, are you all right?
Yeah.

365
00:33:40,474 --> 00:33:43,234
Go. Go!!

366
00:33:44,994 --> 00:33:46,954
Block this up!

367
00:33:49,874 --> 00:33:54,394
Ready?
Yeah.

368
00:33:54,394 --> 00:33:56,914
Again!

369
00:34:02,034 --> 00:34:03,554
Go!

370
00:34:08,074 --> 00:34:10,634
Danny!

371
00:34:12,674 --> 00:34:14,514
Abby!

372
00:34:15,874 --> 00:34:17,354
Sarah!

373
00:34:48,994 --> 00:34:50,954
Connor!

374
00:34:53,994 --> 00:34:55,634
Connor!
I can't hold this!

375
00:35:31,994 --> 00:35:33,874
Connor, talk to me.

376
00:35:33,874 --> 00:35:36,474
I don't know where they've gone!

377
00:35:58,194 --> 00:36:00,434
Go! Go go!
Use the wardrobe! Block it up!

378
00:36:10,354 --> 00:36:12,594
I've got to go back in that room.

379
00:36:12,594 --> 00:36:14,354
You're kidding!
No.

380
00:36:14,354 --> 00:36:17,274
The record! It's our only chance!

381
00:36:26,994 --> 00:36:29,754
What are you doing?
I've got an idea.

382
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:32,194
I've got to get to the bunker.

383
00:36:39,914 --> 00:36:41,474
Connor!

384
00:37:21,594 --> 00:37:23,514
Connor!

385
00:37:24,354 --> 00:37:26,674
Connor! Do something!

386
00:37:34,594 --> 00:37:36,954
I can't hold them off!

387
00:37:39,274 --> 00:37:42,114
Hey! Over here!

388
00:37:44,114 --> 00:37:45,474
Over here!

389
00:37:45,474 --> 00:37:47,274
I'm so much more tastier than him!

390
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,314
Connor!
Come over here, it's dinnertime!

391
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:56,754
Huh?

392
00:37:58,914 --> 00:38:01,154
Connor!
Argh! Argh!

393
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:04,194
Aargh! Urgh!

394
00:38:04,194 --> 00:38:05,474
Connor!
Aargh!

395
00:38:49,981 --> 00:38:51,901
Let's attract your attention, boys.

396
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:56,141
Yes!

397
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:25,221
Sarah!

398
00:39:26,901 --> 00:39:29,181
Connor!
All right?

399
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:34,661
Quickly! Quickly!

400
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:43,581
Where's Abby?
She's on the roof. What?

401
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,061
Sarah!

402
00:39:46,061 --> 00:39:48,181
I'm slipping!

403
00:40:19,621 --> 00:40:22,621
Come on, boys!

404
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,261
Time to go home.

405
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:06,541
Danny.

406
00:41:10,981 --> 00:41:13,781
Anyone got a belt?
These trousers are a nightmare.

407
00:41:17,701 --> 00:41:19,741
Oh! I wouldn't have bothered.

408
00:41:19,741 --> 00:41:23,181
Good idea to use that record
to attract the birds.

409
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:25,501
I'm just chuffed
you care so much, Connor.

410
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:28,101
What?

411
00:41:28,101 --> 00:41:30,141
You're all under arrest.

412
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:33,981
Oh, you've got to be joking!

413
00:41:34,741 --> 00:41:37,141
My orders are to take you
back to the ARC.

414
00:41:37,141 --> 00:41:40,301
I'm authorised to use deadly force
if I have to.

415
00:41:40,301 --> 00:41:43,461
You're Johnson's man now?
I'm just following orders.

416
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:47,021
Like a good little soldier boy.
Where's the artefact?

417
00:41:49,141 --> 00:41:53,221
Excellent work, Captain. I can see
you're a man with real potential.

418
00:41:53,221 --> 00:41:56,141
Very kind, madam.
I think I'm going to be sick!

419
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:58,541
I'd have a little more respect
if I were you, Quinn.

420
00:41:58,541 --> 00:42:02,341
You're looking at a serious charge
of stealing government property.

421
00:42:03,661 --> 00:42:05,181
Hello, Christine.

422
00:42:05,181 --> 00:42:07,861
You're not authorised to enter
this facility, James.

423
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:09,541
I think you're sitting in my chair.

424
00:42:09,541 --> 00:42:14,541
Captain, would you escort this
troublesome man from the building?

425
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:16,741
I'm afraid I can't do that, ma'am.
What?

426
00:42:20,821 --> 00:42:24,181
'The Minister is an imbecile.
He can barely blow his own nose.

427
00:42:24,181 --> 00:42:27,101
Do you really think I'm going to let
a Whitehall glove puppet

428
00:42:27,101 --> 00:42:30,261
with the IQ of a root vegetable
tell me how to do my job?'

429
00:42:30,261 --> 00:42:33,661
Yes, Captain Becker recorded it
and I sent a copy to Whitehall.

430
00:42:33,661 --> 00:42:37,301
Oh, that reminds me,
the Minister wants to see you.

431
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:39,341
Actually, he did seem a little upset.

432
00:42:40,941 --> 00:42:43,821
Christine, I did tell you
it wasn't over.

433
00:42:43,821 --> 00:42:46,221
No, James...

434
00:42:46,221 --> 00:42:48,181
I assure you it's not.

435
00:43:02,221 --> 00:43:04,101
You are my hero.

436
00:43:04,101 --> 00:43:07,021
And mine.
But don't expect any kisses from me.

437
00:43:10,261 --> 00:43:12,221
Haven't you all got work to do?

438
00:43:14,021 --> 00:43:15,821
Sorry, mate, I was out of order.

439
00:43:15,821 --> 00:43:19,421
No problem. Just don't call me
"soldier boy" again. Sorry!

440
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:25,941
You missed us, didn't you?
Don't be ridiculous.

441
00:43:53,421 --> 00:43:58,861
# Somewhere over the rainbow

442
00:44:00,261 --> 00:44:02,381
# Way up high

443
00:44:04,741 --> 00:44:10,141
# In the dreams
that you dream of

444
00:44:10,141 --> 00:44:15,901
# Once in a lullaby

445
00:44:15,901 --> 00:44:18,781
# Oh

446
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:24,141
# Somewhere over the rainbow

447
00:44:25,741 --> 00:44:27,701
# Bluebirds fly... #

448
00:44:29,741 --> 00:44:31,741
All right?
Not bad.

449
00:44:31,741 --> 00:44:36,381
What happened to you? Oh, just
another boring day at the office.

450
00:44:36,381 --> 00:44:39,301
Have you been having a party?
Oh, just a few friends.

451
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:41,501
I'll clean up in a bit.
Yeah, you will.

452
00:44:47,861 --> 00:44:50,461
Where's Rex?
Up in my room.

453
00:44:50,461 --> 00:44:52,821
OK. Cool.

454
00:44:58,701 --> 00:45:03,421
We've had a dragon,
a knight in shining armour...
A damsel in distress would be nice.

455
00:45:03,421 --> 00:45:06,541
Explain to me why Rex is up
for auction on the internet?

456
00:45:06,541 --> 00:45:08,781
Gambling and poker.
Get him back!

457
00:45:08,781 --> 00:45:11,781
We have to find him.
He's lost in an unknown world.

458
00:45:11,781 --> 00:45:14,021
The mark of the beast.
Sling your 'ook!

459
00:45:14,021 --> 00:45:16,141
Take it outside!

460
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,741
You are demons.

461
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,621
And I am in hell.
