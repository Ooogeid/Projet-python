1
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:20,838
Hold on.

2
00:00:22,254 --> 00:00:24,318
- Danny!
- What are you doing?

3
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:28,932
Was that really necessary?

4
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,421
My car. My rules.

5
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:34,124
I hate it when you pull rank.
I hate sitting in the back.

6
00:00:34,336 --> 00:00:37,315
- You sat in front last time.
- Who keeps count?

7
00:00:37,464 --> 00:00:38,962
Connor does.

8
00:00:41,226 --> 00:00:41,974
You lot!

9
00:00:42,094 --> 00:00:44,083
- Friendly round here.
- You can't go in there!

10
00:00:51,642 --> 00:00:53,600
So where's this anomaly?

11
00:00:54,802 --> 00:00:56,538
The anomaly?

12
00:01:07,836 --> 00:01:09,480
It's in that garage.

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,266
Seen anything unusual?
No.

14
00:01:11,386 --> 00:01:13,037
You'd think
someone would have noticed.

15
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,760
He's in here somewhere.

16
00:01:17,435 --> 00:01:20,400
Right. Let's split up and find him.

17
00:01:24,227 --> 00:01:25,894
I'd evacuate the immediate area

18
00:01:26,014 --> 00:01:27,841
till we know
what we're dealing with.

19
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,364
Guys.

20
00:01:30,692 --> 00:01:32,513
It's here.

21
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,543
- What is it?
- Some kind of animal secretion.

22
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:03,165
- Creature incursion.
- What kind of creature?

23
00:02:03,462 --> 00:02:05,658
One that excretes goo.

24
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:07,320
Right...

25
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,873
It's reassuring.

26
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:12,579
Let's find it. Be careful though.

27
00:03:18,086 --> 00:03:18,760
Nice.

28
00:03:18,954 --> 00:03:22,852
{\pos(112,170)}<i>La <font color="#FA1600">Prime Team</font> vous présente:</i>

30
00:03:50,757 --> 00:03:52,536
<i>Bon épisode ;)</i>

31
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,778
- I don't like insects.
- It's all right now.

32
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,386
No. I really,
really don't like insects.

33
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:06,301
Any idea?

34
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:08,894
I'll have to do a full autopsy.

35
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,821
I think it's some kind of ant.

36
00:04:10,956 --> 00:04:12,521
You know, in most fights with ants

37
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:16,199
I'd fancy my chances, but this!
This is a serious ant.

38
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,795
Nothing like it
in the fossil records.

39
00:04:20,102 --> 00:04:23,267
Whatever it is or was I don't want
another one via the anomaly.

40
00:04:23,489 --> 00:04:24,731
I'm on it.

41
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:35,341
Oi. What are you doing?
That's my job.

42
00:04:35,512 --> 00:04:38,644
You're not the only one
who can press a few buttons.

43
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:42,652
I think you'll find it's
a bit more complicated than that.

44
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:44,321
Really?

45
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,742
There you go.

46
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:54,142
- Beginner's luck.
- Maybe.

47
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:58,495
But I didn't want to risk
any more of those things.

48
00:04:59,057 --> 00:05:01,150
Listen, you don't have to feel bad.

49
00:05:01,321 --> 00:05:04,997
Me? Terrified of being trapped
in a shopping centre

50
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:07,278
with brain-eating zombies.

51
00:05:07,823 --> 00:05:09,525
Eek! Can you imagine?

52
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,280
But that's unlikely to happen,
isn't it, Connor?

53
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:16,463
I'm trying to work with you, woman.
Help me out.

54
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,083
Seriously, you're fine.

55
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,614
You're safe.
Nothing's coming through there.

56
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:25,473
Don't worry.

57
00:05:31,856 --> 00:05:33,167
Come on, guys.

58
00:05:40,577 --> 00:05:42,841
- Everything OK?
- Fine.

59
00:05:45,105 --> 00:05:48,184
- Have you been in my bag?
- I thought I heard your phone ring.

60
00:05:48,796 --> 00:05:51,775
It's my stuff. Keep out.

61
00:05:59,398 --> 00:06:01,800
Weird-looking phone.

62
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:03,619
It's a satnav.

63
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:06,287
- For work.
- Right.

64
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:10,277
So you can get from the penguins
to the puffins without getting lost.

65
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:14,336
Yeah. Something like that.

66
00:06:37,786 --> 00:06:39,702
Bluff Your Way in Mandarin!

67
00:06:40,995 --> 00:06:43,971
I'm going to a private reception
with the Chinese ambassador.

68
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:44,960
Cool.

69
00:06:45,486 --> 00:06:47,315
Can I be your plus one?

70
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:52,449
I'll take that as a no.

71
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:56,755
I wouldn't know what to eat
without the numbers on the menu.

72
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:59,912
Have you seen my invitation?
It was here on the table.

73
00:07:02,516 --> 00:07:04,490
I said,
"Have you seen my invitation?"

74
00:07:04,635 --> 00:07:06,201
It was just here.

75
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,478
Maybe it's in your jacket.

76
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,331
Nancy! Give me that. Give me that.

77
00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:18,136
I can't find my jacket now.

78
00:07:22,544 --> 00:07:24,314
- What's that noise?
- What noise?

79
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,105
A squeaking noise.

80
00:07:28,118 --> 00:07:29,837
Can't hear anything.

81
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:37,290
Drop it.

82
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,427
- What are you gonna do?
- Twist.

83
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:52,079
Seven.

84
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:05,341
Come on.

85
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,480
What's that?

86
00:08:24,611 --> 00:08:26,432
I'd better report this.

87
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,325
See you later, Jack.

88
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,575
What's happening at the zoo today?

89
00:09:25,492 --> 00:09:26,965
- The usual.
- What's the usual?

90
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:29,586
- You never talk about it.
- Later.

91
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:46,663
What?

92
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:50,479
Don't look at me like that.

93
00:09:50,683 --> 00:09:53,100
It fell out... sort of.

94
00:09:55,671 --> 00:09:57,680
This is a conspiracy, isn't it?

95
00:09:59,995 --> 00:10:02,262
You two are in this together.

96
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:06,101
Tell me what she's up to
or I take it.

97
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:09,366
Don't say
I didn't give you a chance.

98
00:10:14,842 --> 00:10:17,786
- What do you think?
- Fantastic. What is it?

99
00:10:17,974 --> 00:10:21,861
This is my calibrated
laser refractor.

100
00:10:22,015 --> 00:10:24,466
- Come again?
- It's a mechanical arm

101
00:10:24,602 --> 00:10:27,887
that rotates the artefact
through every angle in the spectrum.

102
00:10:28,432 --> 00:10:32,045
And sooner or later
the angles are aligned perfectly

103
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,061
- and it'll reproduce the hologram.
- OK, well...

104
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:37,261
Let's get on with it then.

105
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:39,702
OK. Cool.

106
00:10:52,394 --> 00:10:54,624
Is that it?
That's it.

107
00:10:55,543 --> 00:10:57,433
It's actually quite boring.

108
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:01,892
So it's not the most exciting thing
in the world, but it will work.

109
00:11:03,102 --> 00:11:06,982
Then I'll finally be able
to finish the work Carter started.

110
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,342
I wonder what Abby's up to.

111
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:13,428
I've got more to -

112
00:11:36,673 --> 00:11:39,175
Clear off. Go on.

113
00:11:59,703 --> 00:12:00,878
Right.

114
00:12:01,048 --> 00:12:03,609
The insect creature
is derived from Hymenoptera,

115
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,622
the same family
as ants, bees, sawflies, and wasps.

116
00:12:07,116 --> 00:12:09,891
So this thing can sting?

117
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:13,806
In this case the sting
has evolved into an ovipositor.

118
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,785
That's a relief. Isn't it?

119
00:12:18,385 --> 00:12:21,582
It uses it
to lay eggs inside a host.

120
00:12:22,545 --> 00:12:25,033
Human beings would do very nicely.

121
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:26,123
That's rank.

122
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:28,643
- Nasty.
- There was something else.

123
00:12:29,136 --> 00:12:31,604
 I found very
high levels of selenium in it.

124
00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:34,100
It's a chemical like sulphur.

125
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:38,254
That's weird
cos when I cleaned the artefact

126
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,233
the dirt was registering
high levels of selenium as well.

127
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:46,283
You say that bug and artefact
are from the same place.

128
00:12:46,412 --> 00:12:47,320
It's possible.

129
00:12:47,543 --> 00:12:49,824
Then the artefact
is from the future?

130
00:12:51,632 --> 00:12:55,632
Which means that the future could
be just the other side of the anomaly.

131
00:12:57,001 --> 00:12:59,018
You finish up here.

132
00:12:59,703 --> 00:13:02,435
Give Becker's men a call.
Tell them we're on our way.

133
00:13:58,275 --> 00:13:59,875
<i>Now I'm confused...</i>

134
00:14:00,931 --> 00:14:03,637
- What are you doing on this phone?
- You don't work at a zoo.

135
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:05,653
<i>You work in motor racing?</i>

136
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:07,790
You could have told me!
I am your brother.

137
00:14:08,304 --> 00:14:12,304
- You stole my detector.
- Serves you right for lying to me.

138
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:16,049
What's that?

139
00:14:16,968 --> 00:14:18,462
Hold on.

140
00:14:19,674 --> 00:14:21,666
- Oh, my God! They're dead.
- Dead?

141
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,036
<i>Who's dead?</i>

142
00:14:24,611 --> 00:14:26,070
<i>Jack, calm down.</i>

143
00:14:26,296 --> 00:14:28,066
<i>Tell me what's happening.</i>

144
00:16:01,121 --> 00:16:02,840
There's no sign of him.

145
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:08,141
He's gone through the anomaly.

146
00:16:08,498 --> 00:16:11,690
- I have to find him.
- Abby, I'm sure he's OK.

147
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:15,312
- What was he doing here?
- I don't know.

148
00:16:16,265 --> 00:16:17,899
He stole my detector.

149
00:16:18,052 --> 00:16:20,518
It's your responsibility to keep
that safe. What've you doing?

150
00:16:20,638 --> 00:16:22,748
He went in my bag.

151
00:16:22,902 --> 00:16:25,000
- This will take time to fix.
- What happened?

152
00:16:25,342 --> 00:16:26,925
It's been run over by a car.

153
00:16:28,627 --> 00:16:30,998
We'll get him back, OK? I promise.

154
00:16:31,118 --> 00:16:34,097
- Stay here and get that fixed.
- No. I'll stay with Abby.

155
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:37,382
I can probably figure
all of this out.

156
00:16:37,552 --> 00:16:40,463
The backup's on the truck.
It needs resetting and synchronising.

157
00:16:41,178 --> 00:16:42,973
This isn't some school trip!

158
00:16:43,093 --> 00:16:45,221
We have to wait for backup.

159
00:16:45,663 --> 00:16:47,604
You wait if you want.

160
00:16:53,494 --> 00:16:55,101
- You all right?
- Yeah.

161
00:17:00,841 --> 00:17:02,379
Don't step backwards.

162
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,782
Where are we?

163
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:31,881
The future.

164
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,753
Our future?

165
00:17:34,451 --> 00:17:36,409
How many years away?

166
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:39,175
I don't know. It's hard to say.

167
00:17:43,043 --> 00:17:44,149
Look at these cars.

168
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,975
They could have been there
for centuries.

169
00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:48,495
Or maybe not.

170
00:17:49,312 --> 00:17:52,183
Look, all we have to do
is find the kid

171
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,562
and get out of here.

172
00:17:54,027 --> 00:17:56,854
What's happened here?
Where is everyone?

173
00:17:57,102 --> 00:17:59,630
Concentrate on the job.
He can't have gone far.

174
00:17:59,766 --> 00:18:01,223
Unless he spooked.

175
00:18:01,422 --> 00:18:04,247
He'll be somewhere nearby.
He's not an idiot.

176
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:05,864
Well...

177
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:12,410
Look. There.

178
00:18:12,802 --> 00:18:13,720
The car!

179
00:18:44,469 --> 00:18:45,694
Up there.

180
00:18:55,248 --> 00:18:56,457
Come on, guys.

181
00:19:06,777 --> 00:19:07,900
Well done!

182
00:19:08,036 --> 00:19:10,790
You've just alerted
every predator for miles.

183
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,532
I didn't have much choice,
did I, Abigail?

184
00:19:14,468 --> 00:19:17,041
- What are you talking about?
- Predators. They're...

185
00:19:17,263 --> 00:19:19,501
We don't know
how they evolved or when, but...

186
00:19:19,922 --> 00:19:23,549
they're intelligent, quick,
and really mean.

187
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:27,216
It's a case
of we kill them or they kill us.

188
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,780
Why are we whispering?

189
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,555
They locate their prey
using echolocation.

190
00:19:32,202 --> 00:19:34,892
- They see sound.
- Great.

191
00:19:37,378 --> 00:19:38,640
If those things got loose,

192
00:19:40,018 --> 00:19:42,196
humanity never stood a chance.

193
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,324
That's it!

194
00:19:48,477 --> 00:19:50,499
We go back. We need backup.

195
00:19:50,703 --> 00:19:52,456
He could be injured.

196
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:55,960
We can't leave him here
with those creatures.

197
00:19:56,148 --> 00:19:58,514
It's her brother. We stay.

198
00:20:00,131 --> 00:20:02,920
You're supposed to make
the tough decisions, Danny.

199
00:20:03,312 --> 00:20:04,725
I just did.

200
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,159
And you, you calm down.

201
00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:10,461
- You await my signal.
- OK.

202
00:20:17,629 --> 00:20:19,824
You do know he's almost certainly
dead, don't you?

203
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:22,257
She needs to find out herself.

204
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,793
In her shoes
I'd feel exactly the same way.

205
00:20:25,815 --> 00:20:27,340
Let's do this.

206
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:36,858
Right.

207
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:03,197
- And that was a baby, right?
- Yeah.

208
00:21:06,414 --> 00:21:07,438
This is insanity.

209
00:21:12,153 --> 00:21:13,679
Let me see.

210
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:15,719
Sorry.

211
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:17,473
I don't think it's too deep.

212
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:26,021
Where's Abby?

213
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:33,948
Quick. Get in!

214
00:21:42,408 --> 00:21:44,673
Let me tell you this one more time.

215
00:21:44,797 --> 00:21:47,674
Getting ourselves killed
will not help your brother!

216
00:21:48,443 --> 00:21:50,945
We need a fully armed
search and rescue unit.

217
00:21:52,108 --> 00:21:56,108
Having more firepower gives a
better chance of saving Jack. Fact.

218
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,367
Danny's right.

219
00:21:59,997 --> 00:22:02,635
- You, too?
- I'm just trying to be sensible.

220
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:04,658
You've always hated him,
haven't you?

221
00:22:06,922 --> 00:22:09,152
You'd be happy if he was dead.

222
00:22:37,985 --> 00:22:39,517
Hey! You!

223
00:22:45,342 --> 00:22:46,398
Go.

224
00:23:00,491 --> 00:23:02,568
Next time don't leave it so long.

225
00:23:41,408 --> 00:23:42,908
Help!

226
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,862
Help. Somebody, help!

227
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:51,833
Help!

228
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:21,922
- I didn't ask for your help.
- Well, you've got it.

229
00:24:23,382 --> 00:24:25,092
He's the only family I've got.

230
00:24:26,462 --> 00:24:28,359
I have to help him.

231
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,165
Listen, I'll make you a deal.

232
00:24:30,285 --> 00:24:31,883
We go to the car.
If Jack's there, great.

233
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:35,033
If not, we go back,
get support and start again.

234
00:24:35,255 --> 00:24:37,604
I will not give up on him,
I promise.

235
00:24:38,872 --> 00:24:39,961
OK.

236
00:25:12,581 --> 00:25:14,337
Is Jack in the car?

237
00:25:15,028 --> 00:25:16,128
No.

238
00:25:21,097 --> 00:25:22,408
Help!

239
00:25:30,323 --> 00:25:31,531
Help!

240
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,839
- Listen.
- Help! Help!

241
00:25:40,537 --> 00:25:42,969
Yes! It's Jack.

242
00:25:44,058 --> 00:25:45,811
I'm down here.

243
00:25:46,237 --> 00:25:47,696
Is anyone there?

244
00:25:52,872 --> 00:25:55,265
Jack, you have to keep quiet.

245
00:25:55,443 --> 00:25:59,069
You've got to get me out of here.
There's disgusting things.

246
00:25:59,217 --> 00:26:00,717
What are they?

247
00:26:01,057 --> 00:26:03,032
Horrible and slimey.

248
00:26:03,239 --> 00:26:05,588
- They sting.
- He's OK.

249
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:10,595
Guys.

250
00:26:14,203 --> 00:26:16,409
I'm going to go down.
You stay with them.

251
00:26:16,613 --> 00:26:18,650
OK. Thank you.

252
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:28,762
Who are you?
You've got to get me out of here.

253
00:26:28,882 --> 00:26:32,265
- I need you to stay calm.
- How am I supposed to stay calm?

254
00:26:32,385 --> 00:26:34,948
- Get over here.
- I can't. My leg's trapped.

255
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:40,240
- It stinks of paraffin.
- Who cares what it smells like?

256
00:26:44,112 --> 00:26:45,637
What is that?

257
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:48,098
It's a kind of maggot.

258
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,654
Let me see that leg.

259
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:05,065
We're gonna do this together.
Count of three. Yeah? Yeah.

260
00:27:05,473 --> 00:27:07,815
One, two, three.

261
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,258
Jack's down there.

262
00:27:21,463 --> 00:27:23,726
We have to climb. All right?

263
00:27:23,861 --> 00:27:25,287
What's happening to me?

264
00:27:25,414 --> 00:27:27,808
- Just shut up and climb.
- I don't think I can.

265
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,162
- It's my arm.
- What?

266
00:27:30,485 --> 00:27:33,085
I think I've broken it.
My ribs hurt.

267
00:27:33,696 --> 00:27:35,869
Connor, we're gonna need a rope.

268
00:27:36,165 --> 00:27:37,265
OK.

269
00:27:51,218 --> 00:27:52,541
This is gonna hurt.

270
00:27:52,693 --> 00:27:54,477
I suggest, if you wanna live,

271
00:27:54,687 --> 00:27:56,389
you keep quiet, all right?

272
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,396
OK. Take him up.

273
00:28:15,366 --> 00:28:16,367
Becker.

274
00:28:18,642 --> 00:28:20,797
- I can't hold it.
- Take the gun.

275
00:28:37,068 --> 00:28:38,918
Connor, get him out of here.

276
00:28:49,281 --> 00:28:51,623
Guys.
Get him up here.

277
00:29:04,956 --> 00:29:08,570
Whatever happens
just get them out of here.

278
00:29:08,921 --> 00:29:10,771
Good luck.

279
00:29:17,327 --> 00:29:19,948
- What's going on?
- Come on!

280
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:45,688
- Don't leave me here.
- Just hang tight.

281
00:29:45,891 --> 00:29:47,419
You coward!

282
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,568
Have you got him?

283
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:02,867
- Abby!
- Come on!

284
00:30:04,785 --> 00:30:06,737
Get him out of here.
There's something coming up.

285
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,247
- Run!
- What is it?

286
00:30:08,612 --> 00:30:10,733
Trust me, you don't want to know.

287
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,139
Go!

288
00:30:12,456 --> 00:30:13,322
Go!

289
00:30:47,749 --> 00:30:50,346
Come on. Let's go! Come on!

290
00:30:57,745 --> 00:30:59,697
Come here! Get in.

291
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,817
Be quiet.
Especially you.

292
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:19,200
That should do it.

293
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,308
I hope.

294
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:32,832
Genius, Sarah.

295
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,868
Becker?

296
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:48,208
He tried to save us.

297
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,656
Are you OK?

298
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:55,218
I'm in agony.

299
00:31:55,642 --> 00:31:57,520
If you'd told me the truth,
I wouldn't be here.

300
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,122
Where are we?

301
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,200
How come it took you
so long to get here?

302
00:32:02,776 --> 00:32:03,930
I was terrified.

303
00:32:04,066 --> 00:32:07,325
Becker sacrificed himself to save
you, and that's all you can say?

304
00:32:09,337 --> 00:32:11,510
- Keep that kid away from me.
- Who's Becker?

305
00:32:11,951 --> 00:32:14,515
The man who took on
a pack of killers to save you.

306
00:32:14,896 --> 00:32:16,806
- So?
- So?!

307
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,118
So what?

308
00:32:19,802 --> 00:32:22,040
He's dead, and it's your fault!

309
00:32:22,662 --> 00:32:24,788
You stupid, selfish -

310
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:30,601
I thought you were dead.

311
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,302
Come here.

312
00:32:32,454 --> 00:32:33,643
Sorry.

313
00:32:34,465 --> 00:32:35,975
I'm sorry.

314
00:32:42,305 --> 00:32:44,108
Can we go home?

315
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,378
That might be the tricky part.

316
00:32:52,755 --> 00:32:54,188
Get down.

317
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:56,828
Get down.

318
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:38,387
Here are our options.

319
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:42,030
We try and make a run for it,
and they tear us to bits.

320
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:45,082
We hold out here as long as we can.

321
00:33:46,204 --> 00:33:48,308
And they tear us to bits.

322
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,400
I never said they were good options.

323
00:33:57,594 --> 00:33:59,190
This is it.

324
00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:18,816
- What's going on?
- It's the fire.

325
00:34:18,986 --> 00:34:22,359
It's smoking them out.
That'll keep them busy.

326
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:24,791
We've got a chance.
We're gonna go now.

327
00:34:26,087 --> 00:34:27,891
OK, go!

328
00:34:28,592 --> 00:34:31,068
Don't stop
till you get to the anomaly.

329
00:34:31,376 --> 00:34:33,056
Whatever happens don't stop.

330
00:35:05,255 --> 00:35:06,668
Danny!

331
00:35:07,343 --> 00:35:08,497
Move!

332
00:35:17,187 --> 00:35:18,287
Go!

333
00:35:57,752 --> 00:35:58,948
Oh, no!

334
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:03,868
Sarah must have closed it.

335
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:19,400
Becker!

336
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:07,067
Go! Go!

337
00:37:25,483 --> 00:37:26,857
Lock it now!

338
00:37:34,205 --> 00:37:35,828
Are you all right?

339
00:37:38,908 --> 00:37:40,868
Does that hurt?

340
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,113
Abby, what just happened?

341
00:37:45,249 --> 00:37:47,301
If I told you
Becker would have to kill you.

342
00:37:47,421 --> 00:37:49,288
He's already looking for an excuse.

343
00:37:49,424 --> 00:37:51,769
Maybe one day, just not now.

344
00:37:52,584 --> 00:37:54,144
That's the last time
I do work experience with you.

345
00:37:54,264 --> 00:37:56,522
Don't ever frighten me
like that again.

346
00:37:56,882 --> 00:37:58,668
I think it's time I moved out.

347
00:37:59,469 --> 00:38:01,589
- Are you sure?
- Living with you is dangerous.

348
00:38:04,272 --> 00:38:05,240
Good decision.

349
00:38:05,476 --> 00:38:08,820
There's something
I need to tell you about Connor.

350
00:38:12,537 --> 00:38:13,948
Private.

351
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:32,503
Why are you staring at me?

352
00:38:32,623 --> 00:38:34,628
Jack told me what you did.

353
00:38:36,077 --> 00:38:38,883
Whatever it is there's
a reasonable explanation for it.

354
00:38:39,257 --> 00:38:41,958
He told me about gambling Rex
and you getting him back.

355
00:38:46,051 --> 00:38:49,068
You could have made Jack
look really bad, but you didn't.

356
00:38:50,682 --> 00:38:51,682
Why not?

357
00:38:54,586 --> 00:38:56,747
I knew how much you loved him.

358
00:38:57,392 --> 00:38:59,547
I didn't want you to be hurt.

359
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:00,440
Sorry.

360
00:39:00,782 --> 00:39:02,827
Even after I said those horrible

361
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,564
and unfair things
about you hating him,

362
00:39:06,556 --> 00:39:07,982
you still kept quiet

363
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:13,145
You did all that for me.

364
00:39:17,173 --> 00:39:18,908
Abby, I -

365
00:39:20,347 --> 00:39:21,789
I want...

366
00:39:23,368 --> 00:39:25,038
I mean...

367
00:39:28,439 --> 00:39:30,548
I feel that we...

368
00:39:31,749 --> 00:39:33,073
I want to - Connor.

369
00:39:35,104 --> 00:39:36,326
Shut up.

370
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:06,707
Yes, sir. I'll tell him.
Let's get out of here.

371
00:40:26,984 --> 00:40:29,034
It's definitely Captain Wilder.

372
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,466
You didn't recognise the girl?

373
00:40:32,754 --> 00:40:33,756
No.

374
00:40:35,741 --> 00:40:38,253
- No other signs of humanity?
- No.

375
00:40:41,622 --> 00:40:45,148
I think we can be fairly confident
Christine Johnson's involved.

376
00:40:45,278 --> 00:40:47,128
Fairly. And?

377
00:40:48,995 --> 00:40:52,305
There was an anomaly alert a
few months ago at her headquarters.

378
00:40:52,457 --> 00:40:54,148
She said it was nothing.
False alarm.

379
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:56,881
You think she has access
to an anomaly?

380
00:40:57,008 --> 00:41:00,533
And a cloaking device,
which is why we don't pick it up.

381
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:04,796
- What is she up to?
- I don't know. But I'll find out.

382
00:41:06,748 --> 00:41:09,548
No, no. I need to handle this
through official channels.

383
00:41:12,196 --> 00:41:15,147
- I mean it, Danny. No freelancing.
- Allright...

384
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,644
Look, I've got to...

385
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:21,689
- You've got something on your...
- Yeah, thanks.

386
00:41:34,762 --> 00:41:36,458
Is she injured?

387
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,193
Nothing physical.
But she was in shock.

388
00:41:40,617 --> 00:41:42,854
We gave her
something to make her sleep.

389
00:41:43,007 --> 00:41:44,520
She had this.

390
00:42:03,365 --> 00:42:05,956
I'll keep this.
Put that back.

391
00:42:06,092 --> 00:42:08,689
We don't want to upset her
unless we have to.

392
00:42:10,132 --> 00:42:12,466
I want to know
the minute she wakes up.

393
00:42:26,005 --> 00:42:28,059
<font color="6ebbc5">*** SPOILERS!! ***</font>

394
00:42:28,534 --> 00:42:31,403
Johnson's military.
We can't go in on a hunch

395
00:42:31,606 --> 00:42:34,455
that she has some mysterious woman
from the future.

396
00:42:34,676 --> 00:42:37,493
You tried to run. Why?
I'll show you.

397
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,437
- Oh, my God!
- I'm guessing that's the bull.

398
00:42:56,988 --> 00:43:00,187
Keep the bull away,
the anomaly's closed.

399
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:09,108
- What is that thing?
- Explain later. Just take me there now.
