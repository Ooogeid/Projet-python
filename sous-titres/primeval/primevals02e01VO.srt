1
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,507
Yes!

2
00:00:49,146 --> 00:00:51,141
<i>My name is Professor Nick Cutter.</i>

3
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:53,999
<i>Eight years ago,
my wife Helen disappeared.</i>

4
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,439
<i>I discovered
she had stepped into the past</i>

5
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,479
<i>through ruptures
in time called anomalies.</i>

6
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:02,952
<i>Now creatures from the past
threaten the future of the human race.</i>

7
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,999
<i>There's only a small group of people
who know the truth: my research team.</i>

8
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,497
<i>Stephen Hart,</i>

9
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,123
<i>Connor Temple...</i>

10
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:13,479
<i>Abby Maitland,</i>

11
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:15,839
<i>government officials James Lester</i>

12
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:17,159
<i>and Claudia Brown.</i>

13
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:23,199
<i>I returned from the past to find
something has gone terribly wrong</i>

14
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:27,298
<i>and Claudia Brown has vanished,
as though she was never even born.</i>

15
00:01:28,444 --> 00:01:30,543
<i>I've come back to a different world.</i>

16
00:01:30,663 --> 00:01:33,439
<i>And Helen and I are
the only two people who know it.</i>

Transcript: evarin - Synchro: MNk

18
00:02:09,446 --> 00:02:10,479
Oh, my God!

19
00:02:11,904 --> 00:02:13,000
It's closing!

20
00:02:14,645 --> 00:02:15,919
No, I have to go!

21
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,039
I have to make things right!

22
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:21,359
Don't be stupid!
You'll get marooned there.

23
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:34,899
Something's happened.

24
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:39,079
Something happened while I was in there,
something's changed.

25
00:02:39,241 --> 00:02:40,719
The world's evolved differently.

26
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:45,039
On my way.
I think we're done here, aren't we?

27
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:46,687
No, no Claudia Brown...

28
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:48,810
Claudia Brown.

29
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,825
She was in charge of the day-to-day
running of the operation.

30
00:02:52,945 --> 00:02:55,279
No, that's Leek. Oliver Leek.

31
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:58,036
You can't have forgotten him.
You saw him at the ARC today.

32
00:02:58,156 --> 00:03:00,879
- The what?
- The ARC. The Anomaly Research Centre.

33
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:02,599
No, you mean the Home Office?

34
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:05,479
No, we moved from that place ages ago.

35
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:19,999
Is he having a nervous breakdown?
If someone can call an ambulance...

36
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:21,088
He's fine.

37
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:26,359
You're getting a little old
for imaginary friends, Professor.

38
00:04:04,888 --> 00:04:06,002
A quiet night?

39
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:14,985
What the...

40
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:18,639
Spoke to soon, probably kids.

41
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,841
All right, fun's over.

42
00:04:58,441 --> 00:05:00,632
<i>I need back up. We've got an intruder.</i>

43
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,610
Don't make me come in there and get you.

44
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:03,719
Evening, Professor.

45
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:27,720
- What have we got?
- A new creature report.

46
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,039
Erm, intercepted emergency call
at the Castle Cross shopping mall.

47
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,451
A security guard screaming
something about a monster.

48
00:07:33,571 --> 00:07:35,959
A shopping mall. God help us.

49
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:39,479
I've instructed the police
to stay out until we've investigated.

50
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:41,014
Ah Professor,

51
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:43,439
glad to see you back well and safe.

52
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:46,359
Though I gather your...
wife won't be joining us?

53
00:07:47,561 --> 00:07:48,679
Who the hell are you?

54
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:51,439
Ah, yes, Professor Cutter's
suffering from some kind

55
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:53,079
of stress-related amnesia.

56
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:54,759
He seems to have forgotten...

57
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,439
Pretty much everything, really.

58
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:00,239
No, I haven't forgotten a thing.
I wish I could.

59
00:08:00,401 --> 00:08:03,319
And now he's being enigmatic as well.
What a vivid repertoire.

60
00:08:03,597 --> 00:08:06,050
Are you really telling me you
don't know who this man is?

61
00:08:16,922 --> 00:08:19,879
Nah, course it's Leek.
Oliver Leek. I know exactly who he is.

62
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:24,719
Is this industrial action

63
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:27,439
or did no-one hear that
we have a creature in a shopping mall?

64
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:29,519
Guys, I'm on it.

65
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,655
Cutter's always been eccentric
but I now think he's just deranged.

66
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:46,319
I suppose all very brilliant men
are a little bit... unusual, sir.

67
00:08:46,481 --> 00:08:49,159
I'm brilliant, Leek,
and I'm not the least bit unusual.

68
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:59,381
You didn't have a clue
who Leek was, did you?

69
00:08:59,501 --> 00:09:01,514
OK, you're officially freaking me out.

70
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:04,482
Let me get this straight.
You're saying something's

71
00:09:04,602 --> 00:09:07,021
changed because of what
happened in the Permian anomaly?

72
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,719
Like evolution has just what,
altered course?

73
00:09:10,298 --> 00:09:11,719
I'm glad somebody was listening.

74
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:13,919
You believe me?

75
00:09:17,358 --> 00:09:18,639
All right. I'll buy it.

76
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:20,559
I could kiss you, Connor.

77
00:09:21,782 --> 00:09:24,686
That's very sweet, but maybe not
while there's people watching.

78
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,989
One thing, though.
How do I know how I'm different

79
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,911
when I don't know
what I was like before?

80
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:31,804
Apparently some people never change.

81
00:09:33,351 --> 00:09:35,061
Is that a bad or a good thing?

82
00:09:52,477 --> 00:09:54,599
- What are we using?
- Ketamine for now.

83
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,214
But it would help if I knew what
size creature we were dealing with.

84
00:09:57,974 --> 00:10:00,520
- I've had to guess the dosage.
- Where's my gun?

85
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:04,719
- Abby's got one.
- She knows how to use it.

86
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:07,679
- How many animal have you tranquilized?
- I've played darts.

87
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,511
Well, sometimes I think you
don't trust me with firearms.

88
00:10:10,631 --> 00:10:12,690
I don't know what gives you that idea.
You ready?

89
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:19,826
So what now?

90
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,079
We go in.

91
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:53,560
- Who are you?
- Duty manager.

92
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,839
What happened?

93
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:57,159
We got a call from
one of our operatives.

94
00:10:57,471 --> 00:10:59,119
We haven't been able to raise him since.

95
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:00,358
What did he say?

96
00:11:00,478 --> 00:11:02,857
He didn't really say anything.
He just sort of...

97
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:04,359
screamed.

98
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,517
Did you see anything in there?

99
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:12,809
I want you to close
these shutters behind us and

100
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:15,362
I don't want you to open them again,
until I tell you it's safe.

101
00:11:15,482 --> 00:11:17,719
Because whatever happens,
it mustn't get out.

102
00:11:18,935 --> 00:11:20,319
What mustn't get out?

103
00:11:29,742 --> 00:11:31,319
Hang on, who the hell are you lot?

104
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,809
- Are we OK?
- About what?

105
00:11:46,861 --> 00:11:48,345
We can't ignore what happened.

106
00:11:48,465 --> 00:11:50,599
Oh, you mean the fact
that you slept with my wife?

107
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:54,188
Stephen, if you're looking for closure,
I'm a little bit busy.

108
00:11:54,308 --> 00:11:55,919
I don't blame you for being angry.

109
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:57,846
Helen never cared about either of us.

110
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,794
She's mad.

111
00:12:00,255 --> 00:12:01,245
Mad?

112
00:12:01,365 --> 00:12:03,364
She took off through
an anomaly for eight years.

113
00:12:03,484 --> 00:12:05,245
Does that strike you as well-balanced?

114
00:12:05,987 --> 00:12:07,002
Just forget it.

115
00:12:07,773 --> 00:12:09,605
I'm finished with the past. It's just...

116
00:12:10,718 --> 00:12:12,900
I don't know if it's finished with me.

117
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:17,003
Don't you hate it when people
bring their personal lives to work?

118
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:21,948
Can you get any closer?

119
00:12:25,096 --> 00:12:26,959
Come on, show us what you are.

120
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,245
What's that?

121
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:32,711
Not sure.

122
00:12:39,201 --> 00:12:41,319
A Cretaceous era therapod dinosaur.

123
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:43,959
- The genuine article.
- A raptor.

124
00:12:44,771 --> 00:12:46,500
I always hoped we'd get one someday.

125
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:49,747
It's beautiful.

126
00:12:55,881 --> 00:12:58,239
I said it was beautiful.
I didn't say it was friendly.

127
00:13:22,675 --> 00:13:24,123
Oi, where are you going?

128
00:13:25,035 --> 00:13:26,510
I'm gonna get a slushy.

129
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:55,705
It gets me every time.

130
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:02,650
Do you think the raptors
have gone back through?

131
00:14:05,738 --> 00:14:07,548
When was life ever that simple?

132
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:16,039
- I hope you're going to pay for that.
- Yeah...

133
00:14:16,201 --> 00:14:17,580
if you can lend me a fiver.

134
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:22,513
Thank you, Abby.

135
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:57,329
- Abby...
- What?

136
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:58,959
Close the shutter!

137
00:15:02,681 --> 00:15:03,759
Really quickly!

138
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:12,720
Connor, run!

139
00:15:30,912 --> 00:15:32,359
- I hate that.
- What?

140
00:15:33,295 --> 00:15:35,034
Brain freeze from the...

141
00:15:35,504 --> 00:15:36,279
slushy.

142
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,919
Right go check the atrium,
make sure we can contain it.

143
00:15:45,024 --> 00:15:47,624
We need more firepower.
This is a raptor.

144
00:15:47,744 --> 00:15:50,687
I've just lost a friend because
we disrupted nature once too often.

145
00:15:50,807 --> 00:15:52,699
I don't intend to let it happen again.

146
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,287
You're sure you're OK?

147
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:57,959
Under the circumstances
I'd say I was doing well.

148
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,125
Abby, give me your gun. Stay here.

149
00:16:24,764 --> 00:16:25,629
You good?

150
00:16:33,305 --> 00:16:34,800
Don't shoot.

151
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,323
Abby, Connor...

152
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:41,279
get this guy out of here.

153
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:47,311
Come on, you'll be fine.

154
00:16:48,282 --> 00:16:50,243
Lester wants to know what's going on.

155
00:16:52,217 --> 00:16:55,399
We've got a confirmed anomaly
and one very angry raptor.

156
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:58,919
I'll put armed back-up on standby
and say there's a security scare.

157
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:00,932
They'll stay closed as long as it takes.

158
00:17:01,052 --> 00:17:03,832
Leek, has the concept of personal
space ever been explained to you?

159
00:17:03,952 --> 00:17:06,559
Sir, it's from the Ministry
and is marked top priority.

160
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:09,959
Private sector PR Manager?
What am I supposed to do with them?

161
00:17:10,121 --> 00:17:12,852
The minister thinks that
we need more help with the media.

162
00:17:12,972 --> 00:17:15,491
He feels that the situation
is kind of getting out of hand.

163
00:17:15,611 --> 00:17:17,085
His words, not mine.

164
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:20,461
The last thing I need is some greasy
PR supremo sucking up to the press.

165
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,399
This isn't a reality TV show.

166
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:24,621
Let me know the minute
it's safe to re-open.

167
00:17:24,741 --> 00:17:27,599
Keep in touch. You know how
I worry when I don't hear from you.

168
00:17:30,401 --> 00:17:33,119
A raptor in a shopping centre.
How can I explain that to the owners?

169
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:41,064
I think a PR person might
not be such a bad idea after all.

170
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,186
I haven't got my jacket.

171
00:17:44,306 --> 00:17:46,641
- You can get it later.
- I need my wallet and my keys.

172
00:17:50,495 --> 00:17:52,649
Smashed clean off its hinges.

173
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,219
It's big.

174
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,506
Cutter!

175
00:18:58,121 --> 00:18:59,337
In your own time!

176
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,199
Just shoot the damn thing!

177
00:19:07,401 --> 00:19:08,355
Shoot it!

178
00:19:14,841 --> 00:19:15,845
You all right?

179
00:19:17,441 --> 00:19:18,504
The gun jammed.

180
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:40,608
Wait. Did you leave that door open?

181
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:42,572
I don't remember.

182
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:45,200
Give me the gun.

183
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:46,667
- What?
- Come on.

184
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:47,948
- Please.
- No.

185
00:19:48,068 --> 00:19:50,255
Just for a minute.
What, do you want to go first?

186
00:19:52,927 --> 00:19:53,980
Thank you.

187
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,079
Clear! Clear, guys.

188
00:20:14,985 --> 00:20:16,319
- You're ridiculous.
- What?

189
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:17,700
I said you're ridiculous.

190
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,162
Ridiculous? I'm just doing my job.

191
00:20:43,021 --> 00:20:44,414
- Is that it?
- Shoot it!

192
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,679
All right, fine.

193
00:20:47,241 --> 00:20:48,959
Got it, got it. It's fine.

194
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:50,953
Come on!

195
00:20:51,073 --> 00:20:52,999
It's not exactly staying
still for me, is it?

196
00:20:53,161 --> 00:20:55,320
- Shoot it, Connor!
- It's fine, I got it.

197
00:20:57,761 --> 00:20:58,774
You idiot.

198
00:20:59,881 --> 00:21:01,847
Abby, I'm sorry... Sorry.

199
00:21:08,956 --> 00:21:11,464
OK, I'm just gonna have to just do this.

200
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:13,551
I'll be back with you in a minute,
all right?

201
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:46,733
Now, hold on.

202
00:21:46,984 --> 00:21:48,926
So you think that
I would just have stood

203
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:50,741
by and watched you get torn to pieces?

204
00:21:51,202 --> 00:21:54,319
That depends on how much you resent me
for what happened with Helen.

205
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:57,240
Yeah, you're right, I do. I resent you.

206
00:21:58,017 --> 00:21:59,398
But if I wanted you dead...

207
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,556
I'd have shot you myself.

208
00:22:22,681 --> 00:22:24,144
- Run!
- It's jammed.

209
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:29,359
Go!

210
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,879
Stephen, wait here!

211
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:11,992
You all right?

212
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:21,759
Look at it.

213
00:23:22,312 --> 00:23:24,521
Just the perfect killing machine.

214
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,519
Do you know, in a fair fight,
mammals wouldn't stand a chance.

215
00:23:27,681 --> 00:23:30,599
Well, speaking as a mammal,
I'm all in favour of cheating.

216
00:23:34,657 --> 00:23:35,803
About the gun,

217
00:23:39,186 --> 00:23:40,279
I was wrong.

218
00:23:42,355 --> 00:23:43,389
Never mind.

219
00:23:43,643 --> 00:23:45,727
Listen, you could have gone with Helen,

220
00:23:45,847 --> 00:23:48,279
you could have left, and you didn't.
And right now...

221
00:23:49,435 --> 00:23:52,044
that's all that really matters. So...

222
00:23:54,121 --> 00:23:55,145
so just...

223
00:23:56,113 --> 00:23:57,457
forget about the rest.

224
00:23:58,761 --> 00:24:01,639
- Do you think she'll be back?
- Is she finished messing with us?

225
00:24:02,863 --> 00:24:04,347
I seriously doubt it.

226
00:24:04,672 --> 00:24:07,599
Helen never handled
rejection particularly well.

227
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:11,959
Professor! Stephen!

228
00:24:18,993 --> 00:24:20,439
- What happened?
- I shot her.

229
00:24:21,997 --> 00:24:24,199
Collateral damage, though,
cos I got the raptor too.

230
00:24:24,361 --> 00:24:26,394
You brought down a full
size raptor on your own?

231
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:30,856
He's nearly full size.
Is she gonna be all right?

232
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,211
She will have a nasty headache
but she should be fine.

233
00:24:33,331 --> 00:24:35,217
She'd better come around soon cos

234
00:24:35,337 --> 00:24:37,399
I need all of you to
get the raptors back alive.

235
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,559
- Alive?
- Yeah.

236
00:24:41,457 --> 00:24:43,159
These things are
trying to make sushi out

237
00:24:43,321 --> 00:24:45,611
of us and we have to play nice.
That doesn't seem fair.

238
00:24:52,857 --> 00:24:54,942
The cleaner was attacked,
he was badly injured.

239
00:24:55,396 --> 00:24:57,173
I don't get it - he was right there.

240
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,439
He was in a really bad way.

241
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:01,675
Well, he must have
recovered and got himself out.

242
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,079
One raptor is a problem. Two means

243
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:10,340
we've got an infestation and God knows
how many running around down there.

244
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,027
I want you to take this to the bowling
alley and meet us in the store.

245
00:25:14,147 --> 00:25:15,124
On my own?

246
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:20,039
It's unconscious.
You've got nothing to worry about.

247
00:25:20,201 --> 00:25:21,759
What if it's just playing dead?

248
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:23,199
- Playing dead?
- Yeah.

249
00:25:25,244 --> 00:25:28,599
You know, as Cretaceous era predators
go, this creature's pretty smart.

250
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:29,584
So...

251
00:25:30,201 --> 00:25:32,639
yeah, you probably...
Watch out for that.

252
00:25:37,471 --> 00:25:38,439
Really?

253
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:50,399
Interference.

254
00:25:54,192 --> 00:25:55,648
Seems odd.

255
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:17,920
She's gonna kill me when she wakes up.

256
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,479
The first Security Guard was
attacked here. The second one here.

257
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:35,879
Both attacks happened within seconds,
Which means there's at least two.

258
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,199
- And we've only found one.
- And a baby.

259
00:26:38,361 --> 00:26:41,115
What are you doing here? You're
supposed to be looking after Abby.

260
00:26:41,387 --> 00:26:42,785
I thought you were doing that.

261
00:26:44,047 --> 00:26:44,874
Look!

262
00:26:47,557 --> 00:26:49,039
Oh, God! Abby!

263
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:50,999
Stay here, tell us where it's going.

264
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,159
Right, stay here,
tell 'em where it's gone.

265
00:26:58,439 --> 00:26:59,439
Where's it gone?

266
00:27:09,441 --> 00:27:11,163
Come on, come on, where are you?

267
00:27:15,028 --> 00:27:17,159
I can see it, Cutter.
It's on the level beneath you.

268
00:27:17,321 --> 00:27:18,919
<i>I repeat, on the level below.</i>

269
00:27:22,214 --> 00:27:23,987
I can't see it, it's disappeared again.

270
00:27:24,107 --> 00:27:26,279
Where's it gone?
Oh for crying out loud,

271
00:27:26,441 --> 00:27:28,759
how hard can it be to see
a raptor in a shopping centre?

272
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,720
Oh, my God!

273
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,679
Guys it's heading
towards the bowling alley.

274
00:27:33,841 --> 00:27:36,639
<i>It's going towards Abby. Be quick -
it's moving pretty fast.</i>

275
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:44,559
Come on, come on, you can do this.

276
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,879
Connor she's fine.

277
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:20,359
Oops, she's coming around again.

278
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:23,359
- I'll just give it a quick...
- No, hang on, just wait a minute.

279
00:28:25,561 --> 00:28:27,674
There are three raptors,
one of them's a baby.

280
00:28:27,794 --> 00:28:29,613
So the chances
are they're a family unit.

281
00:28:29,733 --> 00:28:32,319
So maybe we don't have
to go looking for daddy.

282
00:28:32,481 --> 00:28:34,568
Maybe this little fellow
will bring him to us.

283
00:28:37,096 --> 00:28:39,088
That's right, you shout for your daddy.

284
00:28:39,464 --> 00:28:41,599
Now, let's just hope
they're a close family.

285
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:42,873
Where do you want me?

286
00:28:43,146 --> 00:28:46,416
I want you in there with Abby.
Give me that. Go.

287
00:29:47,855 --> 00:29:48,868
What's going on?

288
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:52,919
Tell you later.

289
00:30:17,434 --> 00:30:18,599
What happened?

290
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:21,759
That's two doses of tranquiliser.
We have to up the amount.

291
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:32,467
They're too dangerous.
We can't keep taking stupid risks.

292
00:30:32,587 --> 00:30:34,891
Stephen, everything we do has an impact.

293
00:30:35,011 --> 00:30:36,799
We've killed them before.
Nothing happened.

294
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:38,919
How do you know for sure?

295
00:30:39,081 --> 00:30:41,779
Maybe the strain of going through
the anomalies has got to you.

296
00:30:42,128 --> 00:30:44,599
Maybe you only think
these changes took place.

297
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:47,039
What, do you think I dreamed
Claudia Brown?

298
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:51,479
The whole pattern of evolution changes
but just one person disappears?

299
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,793
One person who happens
to be a friend of yours.

300
00:30:53,913 --> 00:30:55,239
No, it's not that simple.

301
00:30:55,401 --> 00:30:57,279
The Arc didn't even exist before I left.

302
00:30:57,441 --> 00:31:00,399
There's a whole team of people
in there I've never even met.

303
00:31:00,561 --> 00:31:03,679
There might be countless other things,
big and small! I don't know!

304
00:31:10,905 --> 00:31:12,587
I'll only use it if I have to.

305
00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:33,327
- Have you seen an animal pass this way?
- A dog? A polar bear? What?

306
00:31:33,447 --> 00:31:35,217
No, trust me,
you'd know if you'd seen it.

307
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,476
We've got to get it back to the mall.

308
00:31:55,961 --> 00:31:57,265
What the hell was that?

309
00:31:57,385 --> 00:31:59,779
A radio controlled
Cretaceous era raptor.

310
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:01,531
Probably be in the shops by Christmas.

311
00:32:51,689 --> 00:32:53,464
You've got to admit,
that's pretty awesome.

312
00:32:53,584 --> 00:32:55,826
Pretty cool,
but you could tell it was a model.

313
00:32:56,071 --> 00:32:57,161
Yeah, course.

314
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:58,799
Oi, what about my bike?

315
00:33:46,681 --> 00:33:49,647
Connor! Where the hell are you?
We're on our way up to the second floor.

316
00:34:03,227 --> 00:34:05,362
Professor! Out of the way!

317
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:30,038
Bet you boys are glad
you gave me a gun now?

318
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,929
- How are you feeling?
- Terrible.

319
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:56,222
Do you want me to get you something?
I could get you a glass of water.

320
00:34:56,342 --> 00:34:57,798
Stop fussing, Connor, I'm fine.

321
00:35:01,423 --> 00:35:03,079
Abby, I want you to know something.

322
00:35:03,241 --> 00:35:05,879
If I wanted to shoot anyone
you'd be the last person I'd shoot.

323
00:35:07,118 --> 00:35:08,544
Apart from my mother, obviously,

324
00:35:08,664 --> 00:35:10,919
but you'd be way down
the bottom of the list with her.

325
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:12,759
I don't think I'd shoot either of you.

326
00:35:12,921 --> 00:35:15,072
Can we stop this?
Can you move the gun...

327
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:16,640
out of the Abby area.

328
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,239
- Sure.
- Thanks.

329
00:35:20,716 --> 00:35:21,844
I've got your back.

330
00:35:29,106 --> 00:35:30,479
What can you feel?

331
00:35:30,641 --> 00:35:31,692
It's strange.

332
00:35:31,812 --> 00:35:34,999
It's bone structure feels more like
a bird's wing than anything reptilian.

333
00:35:36,971 --> 00:35:39,960
So, guys, let me get this straight.
All we have to do is drag two

334
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:44,199
of the angriest creatures in the known
universe through a hole in time,

335
00:35:44,361 --> 00:35:47,559
back into an ancient world where
we don't know what's waiting for us.

336
00:35:47,721 --> 00:35:51,199
- Put like that, it sounds so easy.
- I'm going to do this on my own.

337
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:52,759
- We'll help.
- Who's "we"?

338
00:35:56,223 --> 00:35:59,559
I didn't say I wouldn't.
I just prefer to do my own volunteering.

339
00:35:59,721 --> 00:36:02,159
I'm doing this on my own.
I don't want any arguments.

340
00:36:03,591 --> 00:36:04,359
Connor...

341
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:12,704
How long have I got?

342
00:36:15,764 --> 00:36:17,759
I don't know.
You know, it's so hard to say.

343
00:36:17,921 --> 00:36:19,882
90% of the anomalies
are gone within hours.

344
00:36:20,002 --> 00:36:22,044
This one's been here most
of the night already.

345
00:36:25,718 --> 00:36:26,759
Come with me.

346
00:36:28,462 --> 00:36:29,955
OK, what I want you to do is...

347
00:36:30,075 --> 00:36:32,744
I want you to tune every
one of these radios...

348
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:36,800
to 87.6 on FM.

349
00:36:43,718 --> 00:36:45,964
Now, doesn't that sound strange to you?

350
00:36:46,857 --> 00:36:47,956
Interference.

351
00:36:49,589 --> 00:36:51,506
- Why?
- Come on.

352
00:36:56,129 --> 00:36:58,159
You think it's something
to do with the anomaly?

353
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:01,639
It could just be a technical
problem at the radio station.

354
00:37:01,801 --> 00:37:04,046
Well, then, I want you to get
on to that and find out.

355
00:37:05,071 --> 00:37:07,033
But if it is the anomaly
that's causing this,

356
00:37:07,153 --> 00:37:09,759
that means there could be
interference anytime one opens.

357
00:37:09,921 --> 00:37:12,505
Which would explain why Helen
was always one step ahead of us.

358
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:14,479
She must have some
receiver to spot them.

359
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:16,051
We could build a detector.

360
00:37:16,171 --> 00:37:19,199
Something that traces
the anomalies within seconds.

361
00:37:19,361 --> 00:37:22,199
If the interference stops
when the anomaly disappears,

362
00:37:22,361 --> 00:37:24,482
then maybe we're onto something.

363
00:37:25,384 --> 00:37:29,077
Now, if I don't make
it back this time, Connor...

364
00:37:30,547 --> 00:37:31,806
it's down to you.

365
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,577
Cutter, I've been meaning to ask you...

366
00:37:50,122 --> 00:37:53,079
This Claudia Brown. What was she like?

367
00:37:57,332 --> 00:38:00,071
What does it matter?
I mean, to you she never even existed.

368
00:38:00,191 --> 00:38:01,559
Tell me anyway.

369
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,839
Well, she was OK.

370
00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:07,587
She...

371
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,222
Good at her job.

372
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,907
Loyal.

373
00:38:12,126 --> 00:38:13,171
Team player.

374
00:38:15,401 --> 00:38:17,336
But not as tough as she pretended to be,

375
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:19,784
but she was strong when it mattered.

376
00:38:22,181 --> 00:38:23,399
She meant a lot to you?

377
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:25,956
Yeah.

378
00:38:27,177 --> 00:38:27,959
Sorry.

379
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,582
What for?

380
00:38:30,204 --> 00:38:31,839
That I didn't know her and...

381
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:33,770
cos you lost her.

382
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,544
I want to believe you.

383
00:38:41,026 --> 00:38:42,799
I really do, but it's hard.

384
00:38:48,484 --> 00:38:49,359
I know.

385
00:38:55,745 --> 00:38:58,150
These two won't be
asleep for much longer.

386
00:39:01,984 --> 00:39:02,979
OK...

387
00:39:03,099 --> 00:39:04,359
this is as far as you go.

388
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,003
I thought you might try something
like this. So I followed you through,

389
00:40:24,123 --> 00:40:26,919
just in case you had some crazy
idea about not coming back.

390
00:40:27,081 --> 00:40:28,806
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

391
00:40:29,832 --> 00:40:33,340
OK. I know what you're talking about.
But so what? Maybe it's for the best.

392
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,625
What? Dying out here in
this Godforsaken place?

393
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:41,639
I figure if I travel through enough
anomalies, then maybe I can fix it,

394
00:40:41,801 --> 00:40:43,776
maybe I can change things
back the way they were.

395
00:40:43,896 --> 00:40:45,199
What if there's no way back?

396
00:40:47,017 --> 00:40:49,396
What if this world
is the only one there is?

397
00:40:49,516 --> 00:40:51,100
I mean look, it's suicide.

398
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,553
I don't want to die, Stephen.

399
00:40:52,673 --> 00:40:54,545
I just want to try
and make things right.

400
00:40:55,733 --> 00:40:57,892
OK, well, let's suppose
that you do change things.

401
00:40:58,012 --> 00:40:59,672
How do you know that this time round

402
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:01,628
we're not all just
going to get wiped out?

403
00:41:04,867 --> 00:41:05,923
I don't.

404
00:41:06,296 --> 00:41:10,120
You could change a million things
and still not get Claudia back.

405
00:41:11,117 --> 00:41:14,389
All you know is what's
happening right here, right now.

406
00:41:21,202 --> 00:41:24,639
You know, for once in your life,
forget about the past.

407
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,397
Cos you've got a job to do.

408
00:41:37,439 --> 00:41:38,439
Yeah, all right.

409
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:43,119
Just don't overdo it.
You haven't been right for a while.

410
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:48,919
Is it just me or
is that anomaly closing?

411
00:42:16,385 --> 00:42:17,959
- You all right?
- Where's Stephen?

412
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:21,559
The anomaly's closing!

413
00:42:22,891 --> 00:42:23,946
Pull!

414
00:42:25,506 --> 00:42:26,559
Come on!

415
00:42:35,759 --> 00:42:36,759
Pull, pull!

416
00:43:13,347 --> 00:43:14,462
Well, you were right.

417
00:43:15,276 --> 00:43:17,306
It was the anomaly
causing the interference.

418
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,979
Yeah.

419
00:43:20,847 --> 00:43:23,499
We don't have to sit around
waiting for the creatures any more.

420
00:43:24,128 --> 00:43:26,534
We'll know the anomalies
are open before they do.

421
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:31,279
Now all we have to do is find out

422
00:43:31,399 --> 00:43:33,849
what's causing
the anomalies in the first place.

423
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,841
That might take a wee bit longer.

424
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,286
Yeah.

425
00:43:52,665 --> 00:43:54,578
<i>The place is clean
and the anomaly's gone.</i>

426
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:55,999
<i>You can give the all clear.</i>

427
00:43:56,161 --> 00:43:58,291
Excellent. We'll handle it from here.

428
00:43:58,961 --> 00:44:00,662
Oh, good work, by the way.

429
00:44:01,216 --> 00:44:03,662
- That could have been very nasty.
- Indeed.

430
00:44:04,404 --> 00:44:07,083
You know you deserve a rest
and a chance to recover.

431
00:44:07,496 --> 00:44:08,539
Take an hour.

432
00:44:09,009 --> 00:44:12,799
No, let's not be mean, take two.
I'll see you back here at nine.

433
00:44:12,961 --> 00:44:14,429
Forget it. I'm going home to bed.

434
00:44:14,549 --> 00:44:16,366
Well, there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

435
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,349
A new member of the team.

436
00:44:18,741 --> 00:44:21,552
- <i>Who?</i>
- Some sort of PR wizard.

437
00:44:21,672 --> 00:44:23,719
Basically,
he'll be our cover-up specialist.

438
00:44:23,881 --> 00:44:26,727
Protecting the public from what
they don't need to know and so on.

439
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,039
An unpleasant job but it has to be done.

440
00:44:29,201 --> 00:44:30,602
Fine. Whatever.

441
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,840
What's this?

442
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,519
Revised details on the new recruit, sir.

443
00:44:34,681 --> 00:44:38,192
Seems that the new man
is not actually a man.

444
00:44:41,442 --> 00:44:44,168
Well, her qualifications
seem impressive enough anyway.

445
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:48,805
Morning.

446
00:44:49,067 --> 00:44:50,712
- You're late.
- So fire me.

447
00:44:51,702 --> 00:44:53,024
We can all dream.

448
00:44:54,048 --> 00:44:56,476
Now you're finally here,
perhaps we can get going.

449
00:45:06,561 --> 00:45:07,504
Hello.

450
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,513
I'd like you all to meet
your new colleague.

451
00:45:10,633 --> 00:45:12,359
This is Jennifer Lewis.

452
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:27,119
Claudia Brown.

453
00:45:29,118 --> 00:45:30,223
Jenny.

454
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,736
Nice to meet you.
