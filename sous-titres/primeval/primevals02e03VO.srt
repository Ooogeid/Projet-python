1
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:28,528
Which way?

2
00:00:28,648 --> 00:00:30,000
I was following you.

3
00:00:33,554 --> 00:00:34,880
What was that?

4
00:00:52,127 --> 00:00:53,640
Eat paint, ladies.

5
00:00:54,895 --> 00:00:56,080
Get off!

6
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,360
Warren, you are such a loser! Push off!

7
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,280
Is that supposed to be frightening?

8
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,549
Transcript: evarin - Synchro: MNk

9
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:25,812
- You're late.
- Yeah.

10
00:02:26,994 --> 00:02:28,034
Hey-hey!

11
00:02:28,527 --> 00:02:30,360
- Are you all right?
- I got you a coffee.

12
00:02:32,564 --> 00:02:34,222
That's lovely of you.

13
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,440
I'm sorry, Caroline, but I can't stay.

14
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:40,200
Oh, that's a pity.

15
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:42,119
Work again?

16
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,627
You must be the busiest
student I've ever met.

17
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,720
It's crazy right now.
I have to do this presentation...

18
00:02:48,772 --> 00:02:49,840
about zoology.

19
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:52,680
It's really boring stuff. I'm sorry.

20
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,760
Connor.

21
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,200
Come here.

22
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,160
Come here.

23
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,840
Try me. I'm interested in animals.

24
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:07,360
Yeah?

25
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:18,066
I really wanna stay.

26
00:03:18,338 --> 00:03:20,600
I have to run.
I'm sorry, Caroline. I am.

27
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,960
You're sweet.

28
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,078
Am I?

29
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:36,840
Thanks for the coffee. It's really...

30
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:40,400
quite hot.

31
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:43,535
I'll text you.

32
00:03:46,261 --> 00:03:48,520
- I burned my tongue.
- Get in the car.

33
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:14,054
How's your boyfriend?

34
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,339
Fiance.

35
00:04:18,068 --> 00:04:19,249
Fine, thanks.

36
00:04:21,243 --> 00:04:23,473
Just waiting for Connor.
Be here in a minute.

37
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:30,360
Sorry.

38
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,160
Would you put me in the driving seat?

39
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,160
Meet the Anomaly Detection Device

40
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,888
or ADD for short.

41
00:04:42,008 --> 00:04:43,520
Probably not the best acronym.

42
00:04:44,331 --> 00:04:45,320
Breathe.

43
00:04:46,138 --> 00:04:46,940
Sorry.

44
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,880
This is a fully integrated
graphic representation

45
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,760
of the radio communications matrix,

46
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,040
networking the UK's transmitters.

47
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,240
Congratulations.

48
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,880
Your very own Sat Nav.

49
00:04:57,457 --> 00:05:00,463
I believe you can get
them dashboard size nowadays.

50
00:05:03,897 --> 00:05:06,480
This watches over the UK 24, so...

51
00:05:10,085 --> 00:05:12,280
- What is that?
- That is just a demo.

52
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:16,600
When a real anomaly appears
it can alert us within seconds.

53
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,880
- Good one.
- Thank you very much.

54
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,331
Here's one I made earlier.
It's a palm-held detector.

55
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,960
It's a short wave radio receiver
with a range of 100 metres.

56
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,440
I was hoping for something more compact.

57
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:34,800
It's a prototype. We can work on it.

58
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:36,680
Tried beaming up with it yet?

59
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:38,360
Are you here to help?

60
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:42,600
This is a serious piece of kit -
when I iron out the kinks.

61
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,993
Technical question.

62
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,280
- Is the detector online now?
- It is.

63
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,440
So it should pick up every new anomaly?

64
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:51,000
- Yeah.
- So...

65
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,440
Why have I just been told
we have a new creature attack?

66
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:19,249
I've seen enough, Abby. Zip up the boy.

67
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:25,160
Claw marks everywhere.
He's been ripped to shreds.

68
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,240
If I was at the zoo
I'd say it was a lion.

69
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,360
- The bones were gnawed.
- Alright.

70
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,774
Big cat, then.

71
00:06:33,642 --> 00:06:35,880
No radio interference.
No magnetic field.

72
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,320
No sign of an anomaly.

73
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:41,272
You know,

74
00:06:41,392 --> 00:06:42,720
I checked. I doublechecked

75
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,520
every chip and circuit board.

76
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,160
It's working.

77
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,120
If there was an anomaly,
it'd have shown up.

78
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,160
- Stake my life on it.
- May have to.

79
00:06:50,502 --> 00:06:51,978
Maybe he has a point.

80
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,160
Perhaps there is another explanation.

81
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,000
We get 1,000s of sightings each year,

82
00:06:56,441 --> 00:06:58,200
- pumas, leopards, lynxes.
- Yeah.

83
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,920
None big enough to do this damage.

84
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,000
From a private zoo?

85
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:04,412
Find out if anything's been reported.

86
00:07:17,043 --> 00:07:19,148
- Everything OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

87
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:23,960
- If it is just an ordinary big cat.
- Yes?

88
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:27,800
If it's a normal explanation,

89
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,880
the ADD would be off the hook, right?

90
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,395
Maybe.

91
00:07:44,528 --> 00:07:47,083
Valerie Irwin, did you find the body?

92
00:07:47,203 --> 00:07:48,760
No. I'm Deputy Park Manager.

93
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,280
- No, a guest. He called the police.
- Who did you tell?

94
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,400
My managing director Peter Campbell.

95
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,280
No press? No friends?

96
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:59,920
Keep it that way.
This is all under wraps for now.

97
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,480
Are you the police?

98
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,400
Do you know where
the man who found him is?

99
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:07,035
I put him in a hospitality suite.

100
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:08,520
- He's shocked.
- I'm sure.

101
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,830
Whenever you're ready.

102
00:08:11,626 --> 00:08:13,560
I'm sorry,
what did you say your name was?

103
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,480
I didn't.

104
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:19,014
After you.

105
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:24,560
Are you insane?

106
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:26,362
This is peak season.

107
00:08:26,482 --> 00:08:28,625
Do you have any idea how
much money we're talking about?

108
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:33,079
I'm Peter.
Hope you're having a great holiday.

109
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:36,490
A big cat just mauled
one of your guests to death.

110
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,717
Are you sure?

111
00:08:37,993 --> 00:08:39,736
- Did you see it?
- Not yet.

112
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:41,200
This conversation isn't over.

113
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,537
Hi, I'm Peter. Keep smiling.

114
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:46,800
- You have to evacuate this place.
- He's right.

115
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,878
When I want your opinion
I'll ask for it.

116
00:08:48,998 --> 00:08:51,119
What if I close and nothing happens?

117
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,145
It'll cost millions in compensation.

118
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,025
We don't want to create panic.

119
00:08:57,386 --> 00:09:01,000
How about we shut the paintballing area,
keep the rest open?

120
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,471
How's that sound?

121
00:09:03,132 --> 00:09:04,240
I can live with that.

122
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,080
Keep smiling.

123
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:10,160
If you say "big cat" out loud again,
I'll sue you.

124
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,459
- I want to kill him.
- Evacuate and we have media meltdown.

125
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:18,318
How do I keep a lid on that?

126
00:09:18,438 --> 00:09:20,981
What if the press find an anomaly here?

127
00:09:21,757 --> 00:09:23,857
This animal will kill again.
It's inevitable.

128
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:28,869
Perhaps, but running that
risk is the lesser of two evils.

129
00:09:29,286 --> 00:09:31,350
If we keep this open, people will die.

130
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,929
It's your job to see they don't,

131
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:35,663
mine's to protect
the integrity of this op.

132
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:36,851
At any cost?

133
00:09:40,904 --> 00:09:42,412
Maybe we get lucky.

134
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:45,368
Maybe the noise will
keep the predator away.

135
00:09:58,322 --> 00:10:00,883
You have to spoil everything, don't you?

136
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,320
- I saw that. Come on.
- That's not fair.

137
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,176
She was doing it as well.

138
00:11:12,744 --> 00:11:14,383
These people shouldn't be here.

139
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,778
<i>- Cutter.</i>
- Stephen.

140
00:11:26,898 --> 00:11:30,709
<i>I've a trail on a farm
west of the paintball area.</i>

141
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:31,720
I'm there.

142
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,661
Abby, let's go.

143
00:11:41,177 --> 00:11:41,920
Connor,

144
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,127
if you see anything suspicious, call me.

145
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,280
What do I do if I do see something?

146
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,880
Talk it to death?

147
00:11:51,205 --> 00:11:54,717
Here are the keys to the gun cases.
Only as a last resort. Got it?

148
00:11:55,186 --> 00:11:56,191
Loud and clear.

149
00:12:41,436 --> 00:12:42,934
Stephen, did you see anything?

150
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,440
<i>Fresh tracks. It's doubled back on us.</i>

151
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,270
Back towards the park?

152
00:12:47,527 --> 00:12:48,686
<i>Looks that way.</i>

153
00:13:03,485 --> 00:13:04,587
Oh, my God!

154
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,960
Oh, my God!

155
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,840
<i>- Cutter?</i>
- Connor.

156
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,867
There's a creature here.
I'm going after it.

157
00:13:20,913 --> 00:13:22,069
Out of the way.

158
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,720
Please get out of the way.

159
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,653
Out of the way.

160
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:40,803
Get out of the park.

161
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,600
Move! Move.

162
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,160
Move.

163
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,760
Quickly. Move out of the way.

164
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,720
Don't shoot.

165
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,040
Don't shoot! Don't shoot.

166
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,064
You. You, you shot me!

167
00:14:03,184 --> 00:14:05,054
You shot me. Look!

168
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,360
Look at that.

169
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:11,000
- You all right?
- Do I look all right? You shot me!

170
00:14:19,878 --> 00:14:21,846
I'm calling the police.
I could have been killed.

171
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:23,385
Won't do you any good.

172
00:14:23,505 --> 00:14:26,400
I've spoken to them.
They won't be taking action.

173
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,023
What do I tell everyone?

174
00:14:28,143 --> 00:14:31,880
How about a silly stunt that went wrong?

175
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,177
You must let us pay for a new costume.

176
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:39,826
If you'll excuse me
I have a train to catch.

177
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:43,467
I have to be at head office to
explain why our guests were shot at.

178
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:48,694
It was an accident.

179
00:14:53,453 --> 00:14:54,448
Guys!

180
00:15:03,546 --> 00:15:05,185
- It's Jenny.
- What?

181
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,898
The farm Stephen saw
belongs to Michael West.

182
00:15:08,018 --> 00:15:09,104
Get this.

183
00:15:09,537 --> 00:15:11,450
He used to import exotic animals.

184
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,565
Lost his licence three years
ago for illegally bringing in lion cubs.

185
00:15:17,004 --> 00:15:18,531
Tell her I'm on my way.

186
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,091
He's on his way.

187
00:15:22,313 --> 00:15:24,960
- She said she'll meet you there.
- Why is she coming?

188
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,200
Doesn't trust you with the public.

189
00:15:27,728 --> 00:15:28,922
Why is that funny?

190
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,200
What do you want?

191
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:06,480
I'm from The James
Lester Animal Foundation.

192
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,266
You've probably heard of us.

193
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:10,160
No. Never mind.

194
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,640
We had a bit of bad luck,
had to have a lion put down.

195
00:16:14,395 --> 00:16:17,680
- I heard you could help us replace it.
- I'm not in that game.

196
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,240
You're not feeding chickens
with all that meat.

197
00:16:22,477 --> 00:16:24,040
- What's in the barn?
- Leave now.

198
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,998
Not till you show me what's in the barn.

199
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,922
- I'm warning you.
- Mr West.

200
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,480
Jenny Lewis. Nice to meet you.

201
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:38,640
I'm sorry about my colleague.
I said it was a dirty trick.

202
00:16:40,843 --> 00:16:43,040
- Trick?
- Trying to catch you out.

203
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,960
We're from the Ministry.

204
00:16:45,836 --> 00:16:49,600
We had a report you might
have gone back into animal importing.

205
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,792
That's rubbish.

206
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:54,424
So it won't bother you
showing us what's in the barn.

207
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:00,600
It's dogs. That's all.

208
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,880
I love dogs.

209
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,360
Couldn't have a quick peek, eh?

210
00:17:11,173 --> 00:17:12,602
You'd better stay back.

211
00:17:15,399 --> 00:17:16,423
Unbelievable.

212
00:17:25,147 --> 00:17:26,600
I'm breeding them for pets.

213
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,505
- Pets?
- Guard dogs.

214
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,000
Thank you, Mr West.
Sorry to have bothered you.

215
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,750
You're a flirt.

216
00:17:42,131 --> 00:17:42,951
What?

217
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:46,328
- You were flirting with him.
- I was just being friendly.

218
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:50,224
- Your way wasn't exactly working.
- I don't have the eyelashes for it.

219
00:17:51,048 --> 00:17:51,985
Listen,

220
00:17:52,757 --> 00:17:55,333
you do the creatures,
I'll do the people.

221
00:17:55,883 --> 00:17:56,960
Deal?

222
00:18:08,878 --> 00:18:10,840
- What are these?
- Heat-sensitive cameras.

223
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:13,400
The creature knows this territory well.

224
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:16,040
It just made a kill here.
It will come back.

225
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,720
It's nocturnal.

226
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,080
It's senses are sharper than ours.

227
00:18:20,241 --> 00:18:22,480
I shouldn't have to say this,
but be careful.

228
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:24,280
Any questions?

229
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:26,960
- Can I have a gun?
- Take a wild guess.

230
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,423
- No?
- Good guess.

231
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:32,000
If you're worried, stay close to Abby.

232
00:18:57,743 --> 00:18:59,780
I was trying to protect people today.

233
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,470
I think you'd have done
exactly the same thing.

234
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,642
Maybe without shooting
the guy in the lion costume.

235
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:09,058
The sun was in my eyes.
I'm not talking about it again.

236
00:19:11,405 --> 00:19:13,396
Though you do look really
hot through these.

237
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:15,234
It's infrared, not X-ray.

238
00:20:08,777 --> 00:20:09,846
It's Valerie.

239
00:20:11,524 --> 00:20:13,327
I know who you are.
What are you doing here?

240
00:20:13,447 --> 00:20:16,464
My van. The engine just cut out.
I didn't know what to do.

241
00:20:20,478 --> 00:20:21,520
Where do you live?

242
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:27,046
When you catch this animal
what will you do to it?

243
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:29,976
I don't know.

244
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,760
- Kill it I suppose.
- I hope not.

245
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,058
Tell me something.

246
00:20:36,397 --> 00:20:37,580
Why the secrecy?

247
00:20:38,165 --> 00:20:40,200
No police. No press.

248
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,680
- Why is this such a special case?
- I can't talk about it. Sorry.

249
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:47,587
Mystery man.

250
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:49,720
That's me.

251
00:20:51,814 --> 00:20:54,588
Look, Valerie,
I'd love to tell you more.

252
00:20:55,782 --> 00:20:57,280
There are things happening.

253
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,681
Things we're trying
to keep under control.

254
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,683
Things you've done?

255
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,440
I can't say anymore.

256
00:22:37,378 --> 00:22:39,600
Help me! Please!

257
00:22:47,721 --> 00:22:48,857
What was that?

258
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,240
Oh, my God!

259
00:22:54,983 --> 00:22:56,107
Stay here.

260
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,160
Oh, my God!

261
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:12,880
<i>Hello? Can I help you?
Is anyone there?</i>

262
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,800
- I told you to stay in the car.
- Is it here?

263
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:33,442
Go back to the car.
Drive home.

264
00:23:33,562 --> 00:23:34,671
Please...

265
00:23:35,209 --> 00:23:36,480
don't leave me alone.

266
00:23:40,343 --> 00:23:41,350
Come on.

267
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,320
- Can't you get it any clearer?
- I'm working on it.

268
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:04,000
You have no right to
hold me or keep my photos.

269
00:24:04,161 --> 00:24:06,640
You want to help, right?
A man was just killed.

270
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:08,670
I know. I saw it.

271
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,112
Unbelievable. That creature!

272
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:13,920
No-one knows exactly what happened yet.

273
00:24:14,081 --> 00:24:16,200
Are you being serious?
It's all in the photos.

274
00:24:16,361 --> 00:24:18,066
I'll be rich!

275
00:24:18,186 --> 00:24:20,240
The photos are classified.
We'll need your SD card.

276
00:24:21,344 --> 00:24:22,920
This is a four gig ultra fast.

277
00:24:26,433 --> 00:24:27,920
How can I make your life better?

278
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:31,716
- I'm sorry?
- Kenny, isn't it?

279
00:24:31,836 --> 00:24:34,600
- Yeah.
- I used to be a trainspotter.

280
00:24:35,882 --> 00:24:37,760
I come from a long line of them.

281
00:24:37,921 --> 00:24:39,480
Wonderful hobby.

282
00:24:40,485 --> 00:24:43,131
- It's more than just a hobby.
- I understand.

283
00:24:43,251 --> 00:24:45,200
Every man has his passion.

284
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,880
If you could just...

285
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:51,885
help me out,

286
00:24:52,005 --> 00:24:55,280
I will get you VIP access
to the train depot of your choice.

287
00:24:55,441 --> 00:24:56,640
You can do that?

288
00:24:57,527 --> 00:24:59,400
You'd be amazed at what I can do.

289
00:25:04,192 --> 00:25:06,720
I want to see the UFM1
Track Inspection Vehicle.

290
00:25:07,397 --> 00:25:08,280
Done.

291
00:25:11,701 --> 00:25:13,040
Thank you. You can go now.

292
00:25:13,603 --> 00:25:14,832
Thanks.

293
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,440
You're a real piece of work!

294
00:25:20,731 --> 00:25:23,360
Thank you.
I'll take that as a compliment.

295
00:25:24,313 --> 00:25:26,760
Guys, I think we might have a problem.

296
00:25:29,178 --> 00:25:32,640
It's a smilodon,
better known as a sabre-toothed cat.

297
00:25:32,801 --> 00:25:33,640
Fast.

298
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:34,600
Elegant.

299
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:36,964
A real natural-born killer.

300
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,680
Please tell me what's going on.

301
00:25:55,841 --> 00:25:57,311
I know you want to.

302
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,160
Look, we're the good guys, Valerie.
At least I think we are.

303
00:26:02,724 --> 00:26:04,510
Just go inside and get some sleep.

304
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:33,079
If we lay a second trap there,
we've got the whole area covered.

305
00:26:33,986 --> 00:26:35,501
Take Connor with you.

306
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,840
- Got it fixed.
- What?

307
00:26:40,623 --> 00:26:41,840
The van.

308
00:26:43,199 --> 00:26:45,449
It seems to be OK now.
What are you doing here?

309
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:47,240
Working out where to lay traps.

310
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,920
We'll leave the place
looking as good as new.

311
00:26:52,053 --> 00:26:55,320
- You should look by the railway.
- It won't stay there.

312
00:26:55,632 --> 00:26:56,766
Too many people.

313
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,920
Valerie. What's wrong?

314
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,040
This shouldn't be happening.
None of it.

315
00:27:10,406 --> 00:27:11,621
Let her go.

316
00:27:17,028 --> 00:27:18,556
She's been through quite a lot.

317
00:27:54,902 --> 00:27:57,384
Abby, whoa! Stop! Stop digging!

318
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,520
Hey, come on!

319
00:28:46,134 --> 00:28:48,218
Come on! Come on!

320
00:30:03,153 --> 00:30:04,019
Savaged.

321
00:30:05,031 --> 00:30:07,337
- He's virtually cut in half.
- How long's he been there?

322
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:09,480
I don't know. A week, a month.

323
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,120
If it's been there that long

324
00:30:11,281 --> 00:30:12,928
the anomaly formed before ADD started,

325
00:30:13,048 --> 00:30:15,072
which would mean
nothing's wrong with it.

326
00:30:15,192 --> 00:30:16,320
One problem.

327
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,119
The tiger didn't dig a trench
and bury his body.

328
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,599
Someone knows and
has been protecting it.

329
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:23,597
West.

330
00:30:23,813 --> 00:30:24,662
What?

331
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,969
Jenny needed someone to
pin an escaped lion story on.

332
00:30:28,089 --> 00:30:29,720
She said this man West fitted the bill.

333
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,601
She wanted to create
a cover story for the press.

334
00:30:34,137 --> 00:30:35,630
She left half an hour ago.

335
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,904
Better stay here in case it comes back.

336
00:30:38,024 --> 00:30:39,240
Go. I'll be fine.

337
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,440
I tell the police I had a lion here?

338
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,280
I need someone to blame,
and I'm afraid you're my only candidate.

339
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:52,543
No.

340
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:54,440
I won't be stitched up.

341
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,786
I'm sorry. Did I make a mistake?

342
00:30:57,068 --> 00:30:59,400
You mean you're not
breeding dogs to fight?

343
00:31:03,499 --> 00:31:04,960
Admit the lion's yours

344
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,901
and I'll give you time to get rid
of the dogs before I call the police.

345
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,520
Deal?

346
00:31:12,015 --> 00:31:13,736
I'm sick of you people.

347
00:31:13,856 --> 00:31:16,600
Always harassing me,
taking away my livelihood.

348
00:31:20,265 --> 00:31:21,480
Put the gun down.

349
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,400
We both know you're not a violent man.

350
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,960
I won't be pushed around anymore.

351
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:30,920
- Mr West!
- Get in!

352
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,720
Give me the gun.

353
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,671
Are you OK?

354
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,709
I'm fine.

355
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,363
Shot in, my best coat!

356
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,923
The sabre tooth,

357
00:32:06,005 --> 00:32:08,314
- is it here?
- Sabre tooth?!

358
00:32:09,482 --> 00:32:10,696
What are you on about?

359
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,190
If he's acting, he deserves an oscar.
He's no idea what we're on about.

360
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,808
If he didn't bury the body, who did?

361
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:20,475
Happy now?

362
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:21,852
Oh, yeah!

363
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,739
Valerie!

364
00:32:50,983 --> 00:32:52,051
It's all right.

365
00:32:53,091 --> 00:32:54,121
It's all right.

366
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,659
I won't let them hurt you.

367
00:33:29,401 --> 00:33:30,375
Valerie?

368
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:32,834
Hello?

369
00:33:42,752 --> 00:33:43,623
Valerie.

370
00:34:24,427 --> 00:34:26,066
Stephen, it's Valerie.

371
00:34:26,186 --> 00:34:28,080
She's hiding the sabre tooth.
I'm at her house.

372
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,520
We'd better find her fast.

373
00:34:43,819 --> 00:34:45,083
That's Valerie's car.

374
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:51,880
- Where's she going?
- Maybe she's letting it loose.

375
00:34:52,255 --> 00:34:53,639
Not if I can help it. Hold on.

376
00:35:26,213 --> 00:35:27,800
- Don't shoot me.
- Where's Valerie.

377
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,480
She said the clutch need fixing.

378
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:52,568
You gave me a fright there.

379
00:35:53,643 --> 00:35:55,713
- Valerie, what are you doing?
- What am I doing?

380
00:35:56,499 --> 00:35:57,832
What about you?

381
00:35:58,517 --> 00:36:00,999
Don't tell me you're
not responsible for all this.

382
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,919
- What?
- You people...

383
00:36:03,308 --> 00:36:05,360
with all your mysteries and secrets!

384
00:36:06,717 --> 00:36:09,200
I knew who you were
from the first minute.

385
00:36:09,361 --> 00:36:12,720
You created him in some
horrible genetic experiment.

386
00:36:13,586 --> 00:36:16,800
He escaped and you've come
to take him back. I won't let you.

387
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,895
- That's not how it is.
- Please don't lie to me.

388
00:36:20,465 --> 00:36:21,786
I'm not stupid.

389
00:36:23,743 --> 00:36:27,635
I'm gonna take him somewhere
safe and tell everyone what you've done.

390
00:36:27,915 --> 00:36:29,339
And say you...

391
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,160
you buried your boyfriend
after your pet killed him?

392
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,136
That was an accident.

393
00:36:36,911 --> 00:36:39,360
Dave got careless.
He didn't know how to handle him.

394
00:36:39,521 --> 00:36:41,624
- And you do?
- He trusts me.

395
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,640
I'm the closest thing
to a mother he's ever had.

396
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:49,504
I went into my garage one day

397
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:53,440
and he was just somehow magically there.

398
00:36:54,657 --> 00:36:56,194
A tiny cub.

399
00:36:56,443 --> 00:36:58,120
Frightened. Alone.

400
00:36:58,281 --> 00:36:59,531
Half dead.

401
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:03,240
- I had to look after him.
- I can understand that.

402
00:37:04,235 --> 00:37:07,840
You've done very well, Valerie,
but you have to give him up now.

403
00:37:08,001 --> 00:37:09,650
So you can torture him?

404
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:13,400
But you don't call it that.
You call it research.

405
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:16,000
No. That's not what's going on.

406
00:37:16,161 --> 00:37:19,376
Do you think I can't
see how special he is?

407
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:21,160
How unusual?

408
00:37:23,786 --> 00:37:26,480
You created him,
and now you want to destroy him.

409
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:28,600
I care about that animal, too,

410
00:37:28,761 --> 00:37:32,040
but he doesn't belong
here and you can't help him.

411
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:33,520
But I can.

412
00:37:33,681 --> 00:37:36,440
You don't care about
him or you'd tell the truth.

413
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:38,127
I'm telling you the truth.

414
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,900
You have to trust me, Valerie.

415
00:37:48,707 --> 00:37:50,478
It's OK. It's OK.

416
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,454
Come on. Help me.

417
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:55,200
Please.

418
00:37:57,634 --> 00:37:58,880
It's too late.

419
00:38:00,341 --> 00:38:01,480
I'm sorry.

420
00:38:03,184 --> 00:38:05,087
I didn't want any of this to happen,

421
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,487
but I can't abandon him now.

422
00:38:21,878 --> 00:38:22,815
No.

423
00:38:24,446 --> 00:38:25,998
If he kills me,

424
00:38:27,488 --> 00:38:31,249
- he's probably gonna kill you, too.
- He'd never hurt me.

425
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,560
Don't hurt him!

426
00:40:03,721 --> 00:40:07,560
Valerie, stay away.
Stay away!

427
00:40:10,326 --> 00:40:12,000
You're safe with me.

428
00:40:13,949 --> 00:40:14,988
Safe.

429
00:40:16,378 --> 00:40:17,320
Valerie!

430
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,607
It should never have happened.

431
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:45,070
We could have saved her.

432
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,000
I tried.

433
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,798
How many more Valeries
are there gonna be

434
00:40:52,222 --> 00:40:54,680
before we start telling
people what's going on?

435
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,160
You said something to her.

436
00:41:02,522 --> 00:41:04,878
Something that made
her think we were to blame.

437
00:41:05,742 --> 00:41:07,680
No. I didn't say anything.

438
00:41:09,561 --> 00:41:11,127
But I wish I had.

439
00:41:28,995 --> 00:41:30,520
Sadly the creature died...

440
00:41:31,175 --> 00:41:33,560
while being taken back to the Ark.

441
00:41:33,721 --> 00:41:35,560
Heart attack.
Probably induced by shock.

442
00:41:36,517 --> 00:41:37,615
What?!

443
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,200
How's that possible?
It was a perfectly healthy animal.

444
00:41:41,717 --> 00:41:44,360
Don't know. Maybe Abby...

445
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,912
overestimated the tranquilliser dosage.

446
00:41:47,032 --> 00:41:50,965
Don't, don't, don't you dare!
Abby knows exactly what she's doing.

447
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,244
I mean...

448
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,537
I want to do my own postmortem.

449
00:41:57,841 --> 00:42:00,720
Well, the creature's been destroyed.

450
00:42:03,299 --> 00:42:06,440
We have to be aware of
the risk of disease. Sorry.

451
00:42:08,464 --> 00:42:12,459
Now if you forgive me I'm gonna go home.

452
00:42:13,521 --> 00:42:15,760
This whole experience has
been totally exhausting for me.

453
00:42:29,795 --> 00:42:31,880
Right. That is it.

454
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:34,520
This machine is officially double,
triple-checked.

455
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,280
- Demonstrations prove nothing.
- It's not a demonstration.

456
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:44,442
That's a real anomaly.

457
00:42:46,023 --> 00:42:46,920
Yes!

458
00:42:47,081 --> 00:42:49,241
It's working, it's actually working!

459
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:51,436
What are we doing standing around here?

460
00:42:51,556 --> 00:42:52,665
A good point.

461
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:56,200
I can't. I've a date with Caroline.

462
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,800
Yeah? Is she pretty?

463
00:43:02,722 --> 00:43:03,747
Bummer.

464
00:43:34,827 --> 00:43:36,261
Your payment.

465
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,320
I think you'll find it's all there.

466
00:43:45,454 --> 00:43:48,080
- It's not enough.
- It's what we agreed.

467
00:43:48,241 --> 00:43:51,360
You havn't got that little creepy Connor
trunk put his tongue in your mouth.

468
00:43:51,889 --> 00:43:53,800
Sometime you have to take
one for the team.

469
00:43:55,218 --> 00:43:57,920
But it worth my sympathy.

470
00:43:59,828 --> 00:44:01,716
It's OK, I suppose.

471
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,920
Stay close to him
and find out anything you can.

472
00:44:07,782 --> 00:44:09,200
What was this about, anyway?

473
00:44:11,075 --> 00:44:12,920
None of my business I get it.

474
00:44:18,735 --> 00:44:20,008
I'll be in touch.
