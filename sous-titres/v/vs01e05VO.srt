1
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,587
<i>My name is Anna.</i>

2
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:06,756
<i>We are of peace, always.</i>

3
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,833
Nothing can take away
from the excitement,

4
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:12,049
as we open our doors to a nation
from beyond our imagination.

5
00:00:12,174 --> 00:00:14,110
They're calling themselves
the Visitors.

6
00:00:14,235 --> 00:00:17,141
The Visitors didn't just get here.
They've been here for years.

7
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,518
They've disguised their appearance

8
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,841
by cloning human flesh
over their reptilian skin.

9
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:24,482
They'll take over
unless we can stop them.

10
00:00:25,827 --> 00:00:29,195
My partner was one of them.
Anyone could be a Visitor.

11
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,613
They are animals.

12
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:34,033
Not all of'em. There's others like me.
They're called the 5th column.

13
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,118
- We'll help.
- It's really important to me

14
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,704
that you don't get involved
with the Visitors.

15
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,701
I joined the peace ambassadors.
If my mom knew, she'd go mad.

16
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:43,626
Tyler is the one.
You should use him.

17
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,878
- You're doing an excellent job.
- Thank you.

18
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,196
Bring him up to the ship.
Tell him I wanna meet him.

19
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:52,760
There are hundreds of images
being captured by the damn jackets.

20
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:55,972
- Why don't they annihilate us?
- They need us for something.

21
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,266
We want to provide
complete medical services to all.

22
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,644
Mr. Decker, may we have a word
before you go?

23
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,021
- You think I'm gonna die?
- The good news is...

24
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,066
- we can heal you.
- <i>We've developed a vitamin supplement.</i>

25
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,616
R-6, what they're putting
in their vitamin shot.

26
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:11,458
This is part of something bigger.

27
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:14,031
Keep this as evidence.
The rest we destroy.

28
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:17,868
The warehouse containing
all of R-6 compound has been lost.

29
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,879
We have to stop this now.

30
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,039
I got some news today.
I'm pregnant.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,933
Who are you?
How'd you get in here?

32
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:41,726
- Where am I?
- It's okay, Jack.

33
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,854
You're at the V healing center.
You're in good hands.

34
00:01:54,052 --> 00:01:55,997
<i>This is Brandon.
Leave a message.</i>

35
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,818
It's Tyler's mom.
He's not answering my calls.

36
00:01:59,943 --> 00:02:03,243
I know he's on the V ship.
I've been calling all night.

37
00:02:03,437 --> 00:02:05,339
Call me back, please.

38
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,251
Nice try.
Stings like hell.

39
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,420
But my heart is on the other side.

40
00:03:03,608 --> 00:03:05,758
I bet that stings like hell, too.

41
00:03:11,661 --> 00:03:14,804
Someone's hungry.
You're eating for two now, right?

42
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:16,129
More like ten.

43
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:18,447
This is my third omelet.

44
00:03:18,755 --> 00:03:22,055
I don't think my appetite's normal.
I'm only six weeks.

45
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:25,353
Most women tend to lose
their appetites in the first trimester.

46
00:03:25,478 --> 00:03:27,039
You really gotta go easy.

47
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,792
- This isn't your average pregnancy.
- What do you mean?

48
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:32,795
I'm talking about
your heart condition.

49
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,131
We really need
to be careful with that.

50
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:38,067
What?

51
00:03:38,923 --> 00:03:41,056
I think I just felt the baby move.

52
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:43,581
- How is that possible?
- Let me see.

53
00:03:43,873 --> 00:03:46,460
I don't feel anything.
Come over and sit down.

54
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:48,644
I want you to sit down
and slow down.

55
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:52,068
We've had any time to get used to.
I'm sure, everything's gonna be fine.

56
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:56,201
- Just relax.
- You're right.

57
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,238
The OB will explain everything
next week.

58
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:01,911
Next week?

59
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:03,997
- That was fast.
- I was nervous

60
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:07,780
so I had the appointment pushed up.
Our questions will be answered.

61
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:17,464
<i>It's Erica.
I've just been attacked.</i>

62
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,110
They have my son.

63
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,769
This is the guard
from the V warehouse we torched.

64
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:29,894
He was.

65
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:31,855
I've been trying to call Jack.
No word.

66
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,286
- You heard from him yet?
- No, but Georgie's looking.

67
00:04:34,411 --> 00:04:37,260
How do we know they're not out there
searching for him?

68
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:40,279
He acted alone. Everything
he ever knew about us ends here.

69
00:04:40,726 --> 00:04:42,907
- How do you know?
- Because I know Anna.

70
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,005
We infiltrated a warehouse
he was guarding,

71
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,536
blew it up right under his nose.
You make such a mistake,

72
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,792
you clean it up
before you report back to her.

73
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:53,168
And he figured he would suffer
a better fate at my hand than hers?

74
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,293
He was wrong.

75
00:04:57,491 --> 00:05:00,549
- What are you doing?
- My son is on that ship.

76
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,370
I'm going to get him back.

77
00:05:02,495 --> 00:05:04,345
You can't go storming up
to the ship.

78
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,738
That bastard came into my home
and tried to kill me.

79
00:05:06,863 --> 00:05:09,867
Now my son's up there with them.
Don't tell me what I can't do.

80
00:05:09,992 --> 00:05:11,852
We make the wrong move here.

81
00:05:11,977 --> 00:05:14,313
Your son will have no one
to come home to.

82
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:17,942
I'm trying to help.

83
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:19,909
You want to help?

84
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,880
Lose the body.

85
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:33,999
His mother keeps calling.

86
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:36,419
She's worried about him.

87
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:39,251
Keep him here
till we find what we need.

88
00:05:39,376 --> 00:05:41,048
He can only have one family.

89
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,260
Us.

90
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,220
Yes, mother.

91
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,920
I'm not saying again.
I need to see my son.

92
00:06:00,045 --> 00:06:01,997
- I'm no longer asking.
- Agent Evans?

93
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,363
I need to see my son.

94
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,342
This way, please.

95
00:06:14,366 --> 00:06:17,466
- Come on, we're leaving.
- No, mom. I'm not. Look.

96
00:06:18,016 --> 00:06:20,838
I know I was out all night,
and I should have called you,

97
00:06:21,398 --> 00:06:22,948
And I'm really sorry,

98
00:06:23,994 --> 00:06:26,044
But... I don't want to go home,

99
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:27,695
not right now.

100
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,360
I need you to come home, now.

101
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:34,004
<i>Why? I'm safe.</i>

102
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:35,129
<i>I'm fine.</i>

103
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:38,605
<i>What, is it because
you don't trust the V's?</i>

104
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,195
I just don't understand
what your problem is with them.

105
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,254
My only problem is that
you stayed out all night,

106
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:50,826
and you didn't call.
I was worried.

107
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,120
Something could have
happened to you.

108
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,707
What, you think because you're 17,
I don't worry anymore?

109
00:06:57,034 --> 00:06:59,710
<i>I'm not a kid anymore,
stop treating me like one.</i>

110
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:03,075
<i>Don't worry. I'm fine.</i>

111
00:07:04,143 --> 00:07:05,507
I'll be home for dinner.

112
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:11,776
Your son is still on board our ship.

113
00:07:12,913 --> 00:07:14,613
<i>He refused to come down,</i>

114
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,884
<i>so you were speaking
to a hologram of him.</i>

115
00:07:18,802 --> 00:07:20,552
Don't worry, agent Evans.

116
00:07:21,091 --> 00:07:23,641
As long as your son
is a guest on our ship,

117
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,717
you have nothing to fear.

118
00:07:33,507 --> 00:07:36,308
Synchro: <i>Team Lézards</i>

119
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:45,373
<i>This is Chad Decker
with a </i>Prime Focus<i> special report.</i>

120
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,240
<i>An apparent attack
on a Lyndhurst shipping warehouse</i>

121
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:51,465
<i>has destroyed most of
New York city's flu vaccines.</i>

122
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:54,007
<i>The FBI has no suspects
at this time,</i>

123
00:07:54,132 --> 00:07:57,465
<i>but rumors are swirling
it may have been a terrorist attack.</i>

124
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,594
<i>There are even some anti-V activists
claiming the visitors were involved.</i>

125
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:06,037
<i>We'll have more details
as they come to us throughout the day.</i>

126
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:09,541
We have nothing to worry about.

127
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,718
Our fail-safe
incinerated everything inside.

128
00:08:11,843 --> 00:08:14,041
There's nothing left
to lead them back to us.

129
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,573
Even your mouthpiece
Chad Decker can't hurt us.

130
00:08:16,698 --> 00:08:17,998
I'll handle him.

131
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,165
Where do we stand
with our own investigation?

132
00:08:20,694 --> 00:08:23,093
No leads.
Our surveillance footage was erased

133
00:08:23,218 --> 00:08:25,712
before the 5th column
sent their message and destroyed

134
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,631
our warehouse full of R-6.

135
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:32,678
Find who did this
and supply the FBI with a lead.

136
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,298
Deliver a villain
and a hero emerges.

137
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:44,407
The resistance is growing.
If the fifth column is in our midst,

138
00:08:44,532 --> 00:08:46,483
there may be others
on ships worldwide.

139
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:49,778
We have to crush them
before they become a greater threat.

140
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:52,992
To do that,
we need more soldiers, an army.

141
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:55,016
You only brought a few
on these ships.

142
00:08:55,141 --> 00:08:57,161
The fleet you sent for
is still on its way.

143
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:01,491
You'll get your army.

144
00:09:02,652 --> 00:09:03,652
How?

145
00:09:04,757 --> 00:09:05,957
I'll make one.

146
00:09:08,057 --> 00:09:10,215
I need to get on that ship
and get my son.

147
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,945
You do that, and he's dead.

148
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,994
Anna knows that you're an FBI agent.

149
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:17,901
There's no way she's gonna risk
a diplomatic incident by hurting Tyler.

150
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:19,476
There is nothing...

151
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:22,394
that we can do about it right now.

152
00:09:23,636 --> 00:09:24,897
You need to go to work

153
00:09:25,463 --> 00:09:28,661
and stay as close to that
warehouse investigation, as you can.

154
00:09:29,313 --> 00:09:31,069
Make sure
it doesn't lead back to us.

155
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,071
Any word from Jack?

156
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:37,284
- Georgie's still looking for him.
- What are you gonna do?

157
00:09:37,731 --> 00:09:40,120
I'll take a sample of that R-6
we got from the warehouse

158
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:44,003
to a V doctor I know. See if we can
figure out what's in that flu vaccine.

159
00:09:45,362 --> 00:09:46,543
Find Jack, okay?

160
00:10:56,644 --> 00:10:58,344
Long time, Dr. Pearlman.

161
00:11:00,756 --> 00:11:02,456
What are you doing here?

162
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:04,648
I need your help.

163
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,639
- What's this?
- R-6.

164
00:11:09,108 --> 00:11:11,910
The V's are putting that
into the human flu vaccine.

165
00:11:12,035 --> 00:11:13,885
Thought you'd help me find out why.

166
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,758
That's not the only reason I'm here.

167
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,721
My girlfriend Val...

168
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:24,534
She's pregnant.

169
00:11:26,724 --> 00:11:27,728
Are you sure?

170
00:11:28,926 --> 00:11:31,857
They told us that we couldn't
procreate with humans.

171
00:11:32,422 --> 00:11:35,319
This is the first I've ever heard
of this happening.

172
00:11:42,884 --> 00:11:45,037
I guess nature and fate,
they find a way.

173
00:11:45,694 --> 00:11:48,191
She has this heart condition though,
and I don't even know

174
00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:50,208
if she could handle
a regular pregnancy,

175
00:11:51,065 --> 00:11:52,836
let alone something like this.

176
00:11:53,808 --> 00:11:55,922
Does she know the truth about you?

177
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,400
I'm afraid of
what it'll do to her and us...

178
00:12:00,276 --> 00:12:01,845
if she ever found out.

179
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:05,474
Imagine what would happen
if Anna ever found out about this.

180
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:09,026
You...

181
00:12:09,503 --> 00:12:10,903
your girlfriend...

182
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:13,126
your child...

183
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:16,276
will never be safe.

184
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:27,260
They're to report to you for a full
medical examination before I meet them.

185
00:12:27,385 --> 00:12:28,330
As you wish.

186
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:30,130
Where do we stand with the R-6?

187
00:12:30,255 --> 00:12:32,542
All the doses that we hid
in the human flu vaccines

188
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:34,294
were destroyed by the explosion.

189
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:37,261
There's still plenty of R-6
in our healing centers.

190
00:12:37,386 --> 00:12:39,337
Continue to administer it
to the humans.

191
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:42,300
Many of them are too afraid
to go into the healing centers.

192
00:12:42,425 --> 00:12:43,809
They don't trust us yet.

193
00:12:43,934 --> 00:12:46,034
Then we'll get them to trust us.

194
00:12:46,385 --> 00:12:47,391
How?

195
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,370
By using somebody they already do.

196
00:13:00,158 --> 00:13:01,458
Good news, Chad.

197
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,419
Your CT scan showed no sign
of a basilar artery aneurysm.

198
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:08,537
The V scan says
that I'm going to develop one.

199
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,332
All I can tell you is
that the most advanced human technology

200
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,223
doesn't indicate any problem.

201
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,962
What if they're right?
If I do develop one?

202
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:20,455
Unfortunately,
that type of aneurysm is inoperable.

203
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,370
So there wouldn't be anything
we can do for you anyway.

204
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:25,065
So I should let the V's heal me?

205
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:28,932
As a doctor, I can only recommend
what I know to be medically possible.

206
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:30,017
And as a friend?

207
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,436
We don't know the long-term effects
of their healing methods.

208
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,945
So you can either trust
our medicine or theirs.

209
00:13:47,975 --> 00:13:48,981
Excuse me.

210
00:13:54,063 --> 00:13:55,563
Yes, can I help you?

211
00:13:57,251 --> 00:13:58,754
I'm looking for father Jack.

212
00:13:59,636 --> 00:14:01,465
You're thinking of
joining the parish?

213
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:04,950
Not exactly.
Listen, I need to find him.

214
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:06,303
It's important.

215
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:09,481
I'm afraid there's been an accident.

216
00:14:10,745 --> 00:14:13,143
Jack was stabbed late last evening.

217
00:14:14,035 --> 00:14:15,035
What?

218
00:14:15,575 --> 00:14:16,575
Who?

219
00:14:16,784 --> 00:14:19,697
We don't know yet,
but it's a miracle he's alive.

220
00:14:19,822 --> 00:14:21,472
What hospital is he in?

221
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,120
Not a hospital.

222
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:24,795
The V healing center.

223
00:14:25,326 --> 00:14:27,491
I took him where I knew
he would be saved.

224
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:38,892
Any news on the warehouse explosion?

225
00:14:39,117 --> 00:14:41,987
CSU found nothing.

226
00:14:42,435 --> 00:14:45,258
Whatever burned that place so hot.
There was nothing left to analyze.

227
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:51,512
What does Malik have to do
with the explosion?

228
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:53,547
As head of the Visitor
joint task force,

229
00:14:53,672 --> 00:14:55,602
she's been brought in
to the investigation.

230
00:14:55,925 --> 00:14:57,979
- The Visitors offered to assist us.
- How?

231
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,398
They got an alien K-9 unit
we're not aware of?

232
00:15:00,785 --> 00:15:03,109
They have a device
that could show us who did this.

233
00:15:05,342 --> 00:15:06,442
Agent Evans?

234
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:08,955
Nice to see you again.

235
00:15:10,315 --> 00:15:12,265
I'm sorry about this morning.

236
00:15:13,023 --> 00:15:14,023
So am I.

237
00:15:16,271 --> 00:15:17,763
Tyler is doing fine.

238
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,340
And with respect to the warehouse,

239
00:15:20,465 --> 00:15:23,518
I want to assure you
that whoever committed this heinous act

240
00:15:24,068 --> 00:15:25,458
we will catch them.

241
00:15:33,295 --> 00:15:36,050
Our technology can measure
ordnance fragmentation.

242
00:15:36,175 --> 00:15:38,603
Chemical composition
and projective blast pattern.

243
00:15:41,445 --> 00:15:45,295
Together, it calculates and creates
a simulation of the explosion.

244
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:50,991
There's your explosive.

245
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,675
C4 plastic compound, magnesium fuse.

246
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,656
600-foot blast radius.

247
00:15:57,095 --> 00:16:00,292
Now that I told you the how,
would you like to know the who?

248
00:16:10,615 --> 00:16:12,115
Those are prints.

249
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:33,005
We got a match.
Prints belong to...

250
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:38,675
Kyle Hobbes.

251
00:16:40,422 --> 00:16:41,791
Who's Kyle Hobbes?

252
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:43,829
He's a mercenary.

253
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,423
At the head of pretty much every law
enforcement agency's most wanted list.

254
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,301
Former british SAS,
improvised weapons expert,

255
00:16:51,707 --> 00:16:53,261
guerrilla warfare, black ops.

256
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,487
The guy countries would send in
to train rebels

257
00:16:55,612 --> 00:16:57,118
when they needed an uprising.

258
00:16:57,243 --> 00:17:00,894
That was before he became a gun
for hire whoever would pay him most.

259
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:04,343
No one's had anything solid
to pin on him till now.

260
00:17:04,468 --> 00:17:05,649
If this pans out,

261
00:17:06,446 --> 00:17:07,734
it's a big win for us.

262
00:17:08,134 --> 00:17:09,486
I'll report back to Anna.

263
00:17:09,845 --> 00:17:12,030
This will please her
to know she's helped you.

264
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,573
Listen up, everybody.

265
00:17:13,772 --> 00:17:15,315
Hobbes is in New York.

266
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,382
Run all informants.
Work with known associates lists.

267
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:21,626
We got something to pin on this guy.
Let's bring him in.

268
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:26,464
So what's this guy got do with us?

269
00:17:27,665 --> 00:17:30,865
On paper, we don't send a chance
against the visitors.

270
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,515
We are overpowered,
outnumbered and under-equipped.

271
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:36,785
Hobbes can train us,
teach us how to think.

272
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,213
You want him for the resistance?

273
00:17:39,338 --> 00:17:40,965
I know how crazy this sounds.

274
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,045
Believe me.
I have spent my entire career

275
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,720
ridding the world
of people like Hobbes.

276
00:17:49,005 --> 00:17:50,068
I am scared.

277
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:54,230
My son is up there on that ship.
I am helpless to protect him.

278
00:17:55,585 --> 00:17:57,185
Say we do this, right?

279
00:17:57,633 --> 00:17:58,910
How do we even find him?

280
00:18:01,285 --> 00:18:02,635
Your old partner?

281
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:06,845
He spent seven years
with the FBI counter-terrorist division.

282
00:18:06,995 --> 00:18:09,315
He was meticulous.
They have his hard drive.

283
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,590
If there's any information about Hobbes,
that is where it will be.

284
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,828
- You sure about this?
- What if he isn't just some patsy?

285
00:18:17,225 --> 00:18:19,435
What if Anna chose him for a reason?

286
00:18:20,945 --> 00:18:22,945
Because he's dangerous to her.

287
00:18:23,655 --> 00:18:26,953
He has access to weapons.
He could train resistance.

288
00:18:27,155 --> 00:18:29,256
That is exactly why we need him.

289
00:18:29,612 --> 00:18:31,532
The FBI took the bait.

290
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,900
They're looking for Kyle Hobbes.

291
00:18:34,315 --> 00:18:36,374
They will no longer
be a problem for us.

292
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,630
Where are we with finding the fifth
column who are truly responsible?

293
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:42,508
Our people are looking into it.

294
00:18:42,974 --> 00:18:44,330
We will find them.

295
00:18:45,393 --> 00:18:46,205
Good.

296
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,725
And then I'll eviscerate them.

297
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:53,810
If we cross this line, Erica,
we get into bed with a guy like Hobbes.

298
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:55,467
There is no turning back.

299
00:18:55,905 --> 00:18:57,155
She has my son.

300
00:18:57,935 --> 00:19:01,885
If I have to cross a line to blow
that bitch out of the sky, I will.

301
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,340
That's fugu.

302
00:19:16,695 --> 00:19:17,970
Japanese blowfish.

303
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:19,095
I know.

304
00:19:19,565 --> 00:19:22,115
It has a deadly poison in it's liver
if not cut properly.

305
00:19:22,282 --> 00:19:23,480
Instant death.

306
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:25,288
Maybe that's why it's so delicious.

307
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:27,665
Try it.

308
00:19:39,688 --> 00:19:40,887
It's amazing.

309
00:19:41,965 --> 00:19:43,015
Sit. Enjoy.

310
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:46,046
Thanks for joining me.

311
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:49,612
I saw your piece
on the warehouse explosion.

312
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,273
Why did you mention rumors
of my people being involved?

313
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:54,939
Because they're part of the story.

314
00:19:55,181 --> 00:19:57,364
I was doing my job. I am a reporter.

315
00:19:58,555 --> 00:20:01,329
And yet you haven't aired your story
on our healing centers.

316
00:20:02,255 --> 00:20:03,743
It's very important to me...

317
00:20:04,315 --> 00:20:05,565
And so are you.

318
00:20:06,675 --> 00:20:08,331
I know about the aneurysm.

319
00:20:09,865 --> 00:20:12,168
I also know you haven't signed up
for treatment,

320
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,550
and I'm concerned.

321
00:20:14,495 --> 00:20:16,345
Thank you, but I feel fine.

322
00:20:17,605 --> 00:20:19,133
Today. What about tomorrow?

323
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,554
I'm not sure I believe you
can diagnose the future.

324
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,615
This is real.

325
00:20:27,145 --> 00:20:28,768
Why won't you let me help you?

326
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:31,470
Maybe because you always
want something from me.

327
00:20:32,225 --> 00:20:34,149
And you don't want
something from me?

328
00:20:38,683 --> 00:20:40,784
Run the piece
on the healing centers.

329
00:20:42,255 --> 00:20:43,755
And what if I don't?

330
00:20:46,535 --> 00:20:49,815
I can only imagine how scary it must
be living in fear of sudden death...

331
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,185
And helpless to do
anything about it.

332
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:09,350
It is delicious.

333
00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:20,115
Welcome back.

334
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,148
It's okay.

335
00:21:21,726 --> 00:21:22,751
You're healed.

336
00:21:27,205 --> 00:21:29,405
There's something's wrong with me.

337
00:21:32,505 --> 00:21:34,656
They injected me with R-6. I can...

338
00:21:35,912 --> 00:21:37,485
I can feel it inside me.

339
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,093
It's okay. It's me.

340
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,523
How'd you find me?

341
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,347
Father Travis said he brought you here
for your own good.

342
00:21:58,553 --> 00:21:59,896
Where's everyone else?

343
00:22:00,021 --> 00:22:02,987
I'll explain later. Now get dressed.
We need to get out of here.

344
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:16,584
You find anything on Hobbes?

345
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,391
You'll be the first to know.

346
00:22:20,027 --> 00:22:21,027
Great.

347
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,325
What are you smiling about?

348
00:23:18,984 --> 00:23:20,273
She didn't come alone.

349
00:23:26,955 --> 00:23:28,055
Who are you?

350
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,033
Your only chance for a future.

351
00:23:41,435 --> 00:23:42,835
How'd you find me?

352
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,055
My old partner kept
files on people like you.

353
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,130
He also didn't like to
share them with the FBI.

354
00:23:49,255 --> 00:23:52,310
- Who'd he share them with?
- The same people who set you up.

355
00:23:52,435 --> 00:23:53,685
Set me up? How?

356
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,681
Your prints on the bomb
that torched the Lyndhurst warehouse.

357
00:23:58,254 --> 00:24:01,400
If I had anything to do with that,
they wouldn't have my prints.

358
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:03,900
And since I didn't, they don't.

359
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:07,268
They do. Prove it...

360
00:24:07,485 --> 00:24:09,864
or the three of us get to play
"who's got the best aim?".

361
00:24:10,261 --> 00:24:12,366
Trust me,
not a game you want to play.

362
00:24:24,436 --> 00:24:25,296
<i>Kendrick.</i>

363
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,001
Paul, it's Erica.

364
00:24:27,275 --> 00:24:29,258
I'm following up a lead
from Dale's hard drive.

365
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,177
A tip on the location for Hobbes.

366
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:33,888
40 Ellridge. He's there right now.

367
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,019
<i>On my way.</i>

368
00:24:35,144 --> 00:24:36,644
I'll meet you there.

369
00:24:38,295 --> 00:24:41,229
Any minute now, the FBI SWAT team
will come through that door.

370
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,332
Come with us or leave with them.

371
00:24:43,457 --> 00:24:44,315
Choose one.

372
00:24:51,604 --> 00:24:53,221
We only came here for help.

373
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,095
My kind of help costs,

374
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,353
And you're living on a fed's salary,
that sounds like a raw deal for me.

375
00:24:58,478 --> 00:24:59,830
We can get you money.

376
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:03,260
We can also get you something
more valuable.

377
00:25:03,688 --> 00:25:04,428
What?

378
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:06,838
The people who framed you.
Aren't you curious?

379
00:25:07,552 --> 00:25:10,022
You have one minute.
Your choice.

380
00:25:21,323 --> 00:25:24,239
- Where is he?
- We just missed him, cigar's still lit.

381
00:25:24,364 --> 00:25:26,448
There's another door.
Escape route.

382
00:25:41,489 --> 00:25:42,822
Where's Hobbes?

383
00:25:43,184 --> 00:25:45,396
Gone.
Somebody tipped him off.

384
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,213
Did you find what we're looking for?

385
00:26:24,322 --> 00:26:25,996
There's just so much.

386
00:26:35,154 --> 00:26:36,664
What does it all mean?

387
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:39,566
They don't seem
to serve any purpose.

388
00:26:39,691 --> 00:26:43,100
Human memories contain emotion,
not just information.

389
00:26:43,924 --> 00:26:46,422
That's why they can be
difficult to interpret.

390
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:48,749
Why aren't our memories like that?

391
00:26:49,296 --> 00:26:51,988
Our species is designed
for efficiency.

392
00:26:53,255 --> 00:26:56,662
We're not burdened by
emotional imprints like humans.

393
00:27:21,422 --> 00:27:22,890
We have what we need.

394
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:27,292
Tyler must calm her fears,
loosen her bond on him.

395
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:30,249
And he will be free from her.

396
00:27:30,585 --> 00:27:32,134
And you, my daughter,

397
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:35,144
will be free
to fulfill your destiny.

398
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,603
- That was amazing.
- We call it a memory chamber.

399
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:57,230
But it felt like I was really there.

400
00:27:57,355 --> 00:27:59,200
We tapped into your cerebral cortex,

401
00:27:59,325 --> 00:28:02,179
Allowing you to relive
your memories in vivid detail.

402
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,561
It affected you.

403
00:28:03,686 --> 00:28:05,849
I saw my family, a long time ago.

404
00:28:05,974 --> 00:28:07,350
You know what I saw?

405
00:28:07,943 --> 00:28:10,182
I saw a mother
afraid of losing her son.

406
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:13,420
Go home.

407
00:28:14,084 --> 00:28:16,235
Tell her it's okay to let you go,

408
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:18,035
Not to be afraid.

409
00:28:19,391 --> 00:28:22,011
You're becoming a man,
starting your own life.

410
00:28:22,298 --> 00:28:24,827
That doesn't mean she'll lose
you like she did your father.

411
00:28:41,173 --> 00:28:42,168
You okay?

412
00:28:42,293 --> 00:28:43,736
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

413
00:28:44,103 --> 00:28:45,713
Thank you, Georgie.

414
00:28:46,144 --> 00:28:47,224
This is Hobbes.

415
00:28:47,652 --> 00:28:50,895
He's ex-military,
gun for hire, weapons expert.

416
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,626
He can get us weapons.
He can teach us to fight.

417
00:28:53,814 --> 00:28:55,938
He's a known terrorist,
only loyal to money.

418
00:28:56,063 --> 00:28:58,905
- That makes him predictable.
- And if someone pays him more than us?

419
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,446
Anna is fighting dirty.

420
00:29:00,773 --> 00:29:03,784
If we want to win this war,
we can't bring knives to a gunfight.

421
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,368
You're forgetting one thing.

422
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:07,662
I haven't said yes yet.

423
00:29:09,411 --> 00:29:11,274
Have you looked in the sky lately?

424
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:13,292
They're here to annihilate us.

425
00:29:14,233 --> 00:29:17,143
Unless you got deep pockets,
I'm not interested in your cause.

426
00:29:17,268 --> 00:29:19,364
This isn't just a cause for us.

427
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,302
It's his way of life.
It's my faith.

428
00:29:23,687 --> 00:29:26,326
Revenge for a family slaughtered,
her son.

429
00:29:27,174 --> 00:29:30,075
We all have a stake in this.
Don't think you don't.

430
00:29:31,189 --> 00:29:33,026
Go ahead and walk away.

431
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,272
I still have your prints
on that bomb.

432
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:40,986
And you're trying to hire me,
a known fugitive, to do your bidding.

433
00:29:43,378 --> 00:29:44,302
Yeah.

434
00:29:45,102 --> 00:29:47,370
You have as much to lose now
as I do.

435
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:51,372
So last time, show me the money
or show me the door.

436
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,095
You're right.

437
00:30:01,819 --> 00:30:04,427
Like it or not,
we're all in this together now.

438
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:09,212
So how about I show you the truth?

439
00:30:09,337 --> 00:30:11,426
The V's are nothing but lies.

440
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:13,785
They look like you.

441
00:30:14,254 --> 00:30:17,026
They sound like you.

442
00:30:17,151 --> 00:30:19,442
But we are not like you.

443
00:30:32,543 --> 00:30:34,290
So you're telling me...

444
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,822
I'm one of them.

445
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:41,940
But I am not with them.

446
00:30:45,631 --> 00:30:47,837
And they're the ones
that framed you.

447
00:30:47,962 --> 00:30:51,120
Aren't you the least bit
pissed off and curious why?

448
00:30:54,762 --> 00:30:56,307
Welcome to the war.

449
00:30:58,776 --> 00:31:00,456
<i>Hey, mom. It's Ty.</i>

450
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:03,098
<i>On my way home from the ship now.</i>

451
00:31:03,223 --> 00:31:06,139
<i>I'll see you at dinner.
Okay. Bye.</i>

452
00:31:14,753 --> 00:31:16,373
Georgie told me what happened.

453
00:31:17,936 --> 00:31:19,885
I got the guy who stabbed you.

454
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,756
He's a pair
of lizard skin boots now.

455
00:31:27,141 --> 00:31:28,384
How's tyler?

456
00:31:28,509 --> 00:31:29,353
Okay.

457
00:31:30,608 --> 00:31:32,223
He's coming home for dinner.

458
00:31:32,854 --> 00:31:33,974
That's good.

459
00:31:36,093 --> 00:31:37,561
How are you?

460
00:31:38,804 --> 00:31:40,397
I'm fine.

461
00:31:41,188 --> 00:31:42,733
You lying to me, father?

462
00:31:44,858 --> 00:31:48,489
I feel like something's changed
inside me.

463
00:31:51,186 --> 00:31:52,656
We're all changing.

464
00:31:55,153 --> 00:31:56,756
I just made a deal...

465
00:31:57,486 --> 00:31:58,959
With the devil.

466
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:03,587
I broke every oath
that I have sworn to protect.

467
00:32:06,447 --> 00:32:07,967
I don't know what I'm thinking.

468
00:32:08,338 --> 00:32:10,591
You're thinking about
protecting your son,

469
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,441
The ones you love.

470
00:32:20,304 --> 00:32:21,772
It's good to see a friend.

471
00:32:23,638 --> 00:32:24,667
Me, too.

472
00:32:32,698 --> 00:32:33,951
What did you find out?

473
00:32:34,795 --> 00:32:37,148
Examination of the R-6
using human technology

474
00:32:37,273 --> 00:32:39,164
revealed nothing
but a simple saline shot.

475
00:32:40,142 --> 00:32:43,127
But when I used our equipment,
I found something quite different.

476
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,703
R-6 has a molecular compound

477
00:32:45,828 --> 00:32:47,720
that embeds itself in human D.N.A.

478
00:32:48,379 --> 00:32:50,146
It interacts with the human genome,

479
00:32:50,271 --> 00:32:53,304
then emits a wavelength
of sorts, like a transmission.

480
00:32:54,011 --> 00:32:56,974
So she's tagging humans
like animals in the wild.

481
00:32:59,814 --> 00:33:01,970
You tell anybody about this?

482
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:03,188
No.

483
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,274
And neither should you.

484
00:33:07,475 --> 00:33:09,475
Not until we know the truth.

485
00:33:19,972 --> 00:33:22,879
How are the candidates for the
next phase of the R-6 plan looking?

486
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:26,003
I think Anna will be pleased.

487
00:33:38,504 --> 00:33:40,146
<i>I'm Chad Decker, reporting live</i>

488
00:33:40,271 --> 00:33:42,407
<i>from the Manhattan
Visitor Healing Center.</i>

489
00:33:42,532 --> 00:33:45,088
<i>Miracle cures? Wonder drugs?</i>

490
00:33:45,213 --> 00:33:48,359
<i>Tonight "Prime Focus" takes you

491
00:33:48,772 --> 00:33:51,586
<i>where science fiction

492
00:33:51,711 --> 00:33:52,947
<i>for those in need,</i>

493
00:33:53,504 --> 00:33:54,666
<i>for those like me.</i>

494
00:33:55,545 --> 00:33:58,012
<i>During my visit here
for this report,</i>

495
00:33:58,137 --> 00:34:01,380
<i>the V doctors diagnosed me
with a lethal brian aneurysm.</i>

496
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:04,351
<i>They're telling me they have a cure,</i>

497
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:06,794
<i>I'm gonna take it.</i>

498
00:34:07,726 --> 00:34:10,214
<i>"Prime Focus" will take

499

<i>as I am healed

500
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,403
<i>giving all of you a firsthand
look at their miracle cures.</i>

501
00:34:17,076 --> 00:34:18,386
What is it?

502
00:34:19,007 --> 00:34:22,489
Mr. Decker just made sure
we'd take very good care of him.

503
00:34:23,255 --> 00:34:25,506
Kyle Hobbes escaped the fbi.

504
00:34:26,513 --> 00:34:28,309
We suspect he was tipped off.

505
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:29,521
Fifth column?

506
00:34:30,284 --> 00:34:31,333
Perhaps.

507
00:34:33,056 --> 00:34:35,239
He can help them
build an army against us.

508
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:38,746
It's time to build our own.

509
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,904
You have been selected from
the best among the 29 ships.

510
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:47,883
Our army will begin with one of you.

511
00:34:48,477 --> 00:34:51,778
The very survival of our species
will depend on one of you.

512
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:54,466
Your queen commands it.

513
00:35:31,865 --> 00:35:32,714
Him.

514
00:35:47,434 --> 00:35:49,188
- Mom?
- Ty.

515
00:35:49,736 --> 00:35:51,374
Thank god you're home.

516
00:35:57,969 --> 00:35:59,250
Are you okay?

517
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:02,141
Are you?

518
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:05,788
Do you have any idea
what you put me through today?

519
00:36:06,788 --> 00:36:07,539
Yes.

520
00:36:08,563 --> 00:36:10,030
And I'm sorry.

521
00:36:11,229 --> 00:36:11,947
But...

522
00:36:12,442 --> 00:36:14,605
I need to tell you something.

523
00:36:15,461 --> 00:36:18,008
Just listen to me for once, mom.

524
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:21,011
Okay.

525
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,178
You're not gonna lose me.

526
00:36:26,303 --> 00:36:27,309
I'm not dad.

527
00:36:29,502 --> 00:36:32,715
I am always gonna be here for you.

528
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,005
Just because I'm grown up...

529
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:39,696
It doesn't mean we gotta grow apart.

530
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,679
How can I expect you
to understand my choices

531
00:36:44,804 --> 00:36:47,704
If I can't be
completely honest with you?

532
00:36:50,177 --> 00:36:51,228
About what?

533
00:36:54,887 --> 00:36:56,088
The Visitors.

534
00:36:56,926 --> 00:36:58,834
I need to talk to you about the V.

535
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:01,844
There's something I have
to tell you, it's very...

536
00:37:02,308 --> 00:37:04,316
I joined the peace ambassadors.

537
00:37:12,373 --> 00:37:15,190
You don't have to be afraid
of the V's anymore.

538
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:20,033
<i>I'm not afraid of the Visitors, Ty.</i>

539
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,093
<i>I'm just afraid of losing you.</i>

540
00:37:25,638 --> 00:37:26,720
<i>You won't.</i>

541
00:37:28,308 --> 00:37:29,401
<i>Trust me.</i>

542
00:37:31,729 --> 00:37:33,340
I do trust you.

543
00:37:35,304 --> 00:37:38,240
No more secrets about
the Visitors, okay?

544
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,684
Don't worry.

545
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:44,766
Mom, the Visitors-
they don't have any secrets.

546
00:38:42,397 --> 00:38:43,156
Val?

547
00:38:45,225 --> 00:38:46,066
Val?

548
00:38:48,287 --> 00:38:50,786
- Everything okay?
- Something's not right.

549
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:52,314
What do you mean?

550
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,666
I've been eating nonstop
all day long,

551
00:38:55,846 --> 00:38:58,168
and I've had weird cravings.
Something's not right.

552
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:03,767
I never told you this,
but I always wanted kids.

553
00:39:03,892 --> 00:39:07,119
And then I met you, and you told me
that it wasn't a possibility for you.

554
00:39:07,331 --> 00:39:09,698
And then I realized
that if there was anything

555
00:39:09,823 --> 00:39:12,747
that I wanted more than being a
mom, it was to be with you.

556
00:39:16,846 --> 00:39:19,252
It's a miracle, this baby, Ryan.

557
00:39:20,245 --> 00:39:22,070
It happened for a reason.

558
00:39:23,691 --> 00:39:25,033
I know it did.

559
00:40:50,584 --> 00:40:51,729
It's done.

560
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,846
My army is to be born.

561
00:41:00,418 --> 00:41:02,322
Now my eggs need nourishment.
