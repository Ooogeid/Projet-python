1
00:00:02,337 --> 00:00:04,798
<i>My Name is Anna.
I am the leader of my people.</i>

2
00:00:04,923 --> 00:00:06,671
They're calling themselves
"The Visitors."

3
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:08,412
<i>- You watching?</i>
- Yeah I'm watching.

4
00:00:08,537 --> 00:00:10,759
You all seem to be what
we consider attractive.

5
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:13,285
- You're not so bad yourself.
- Whenever Anna has something

6
00:00:13,473 --> 00:00:16,056
significant to say,
we would like her to say it through you.

7
00:00:16,464 --> 00:00:18,537
They knew we were coming.
Someone tipped them off.

8
00:00:18,662 --> 00:00:19,685
We need your help.

9
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:22,896
- I'm not gonna put my fiancée at risk.
- Welcome to the New York mother ship.

10
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:25,094
Have you heard about our new
peace Ambassador program?

11
00:00:25,237 --> 00:00:26,816
You two are obsessed with Visitors.

12
00:00:26,988 --> 00:00:30,153
- They call it spreading hope.
- Take this and go to this address.

13
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:33,858
- All the information's inside.
- The visitors didn't just get here.

14
00:00:33,983 --> 00:00:35,335
They've been here for years.

15
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,203
They'll take over
unless we can stop them.

16
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:50,889
You were right to fight.
There's others out there like me.

17
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:53,218
- We'll help.
- They have a big head start.

18
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,611
They're arming themselves with the most
powerful weapon out there.

19
00:00:56,736 --> 00:00:58,890
- What big weapon?
- Devotion.

20
00:01:03,144 --> 00:01:04,998
I don't know who to trust anymore.

21
00:01:06,168 --> 00:01:09,129
I can't get the image of dale
just lying there out of my head.

22
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,831
What do we do now?

23
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:25,617
We help build a resistance.
We recruit.

24
00:01:26,742 --> 00:01:28,150
We have to be careful.

25
00:01:28,686 --> 00:01:29,974
We'll be careful.

26
00:01:30,951 --> 00:01:32,781
Are we the only ones who got away?

27
00:01:33,405 --> 00:01:35,246
No, there were others.

28
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:47,578
- What's going on?
- It's going to the warehouse.

29
00:02:10,428 --> 00:02:12,780
- What are they doing?
- They're cleaning up.

30
00:02:12,905 --> 00:02:14,466
What?
We have to do something.

31
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,025
No. It has to be anonymous.

32
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,977
<i>9-1-1. What's your emergency?</i>

33
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:29,348
Oh, my God.
It's a massacre. Please.

34
00:02:29,476 --> 00:02:31,442
Please, they're killing people.
You have to come.

35
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:32,818
<i>Where are you?</i>

36
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,061
It's a warehouse...
4400 Pier avenue, Brooklyn.

37
00:02:36,483 --> 00:02:37,781
Please send the police.

38
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:40,924
- Go. We're sitting ducks out here.
<i>- I'm contacting dispatch now.</i>

39
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:43,260
<i>- How many people were killed?</i>
- I don't know a lot. Look,

40
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:45,079
just send everyone that you've got.

41
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:46,516
Okay ma'am, don't hang up.

42
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:48,542
I need to confirm
that address with you again.

43
00:02:48,688 --> 00:02:50,381
You're at 400 pier avenue?

44
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:52,251
Yes. How many times
do I have to tell you?

45
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:54,999
<i>I'm gonna stay with you on
the line until help arrives.</i>

46
00:02:55,251 --> 00:02:58,484
<i>- What's your name, ma'am?</i>
- Hang up. Hang up! Hang up!

47
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:27,511
- They must've seen us.
- No.

48
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,258
They intercepted the call.

49
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:31,459
- What?
- The Visitors they traced the call.

50
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:34,130
- How is that possible?
- How is any of this possible?

51
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:36,823
Dale was my partner.
He was one of 'em.

52
00:03:36,948 --> 00:03:39,090
He's been my partner
for seven years,

53
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:41,343
long before the ships showed up.

54
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,304
Anyone could be Visitors.

55
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:48,482
Jack, go home.

56
00:03:48,724 --> 00:03:49,724
What?

57
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:52,747
Go home. Act normal.
Pretend this never happened.

58
00:03:52,872 --> 00:03:54,523
Wait we can't just
walk away from this.

59
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:57,694
We can't attack it head-on, either.
It's too dangerous.

60
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:00,029
I have to figure out what to do.

61
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:01,490
Go home.

62
00:04:02,307 --> 00:04:03,619
Don't trust anyone.

63
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:05,225
Anyone.

64
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,083
God!

65
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,800
I thought you were...

66
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:56,586
where have you been?

67
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:59,722
- With Brandon.
- All night?

68
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:03,281
My bike broke down.

69
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,012
Are you sure you're okay?

70
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,642
Ty, I need to talk to
you about yesterday.

71
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:14,496
It is really important to me that you
don't get involved with the visitors.

72
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,850
With the Visitors.
I know they're exciting

73
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,318
and Kinda cool, but...

74
00:05:20,675 --> 00:05:22,108
for me, can you do that?

75
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:27,763
You're just saying that.

76
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,602
Promise.

77
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:32,906
Yeah. I mean,
if it it's that big of a deal to you...

78
00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:37,251
No more visitor stuff.
You know, I...

79
00:05:38,415 --> 00:05:39,426
I promise.

80
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:41,525
Good.

81
00:05:43,245 --> 00:05:44,605
I need you to be safe.

82
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:47,213
I am.

83
00:05:50,023 --> 00:05:51,886
- Can I go to bed now?
- Yeah.

84
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:00,483
I love you, Ty.

85
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:31,340
<i>After three weeks of evaluation,
a decision on whether the U.S.</i>

86
00:06:31,472 --> 00:06:35,018
<i>will Establish diplomatic ties with
the Visitors may come as early as today.</i>

87
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:38,385
<i>The decision will be based in large part
on a recommendation</i>

88
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:40,606
<i>from the Visitor threat
assessment joint task force.</i>

89
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,297
<i>Establishing relations
would grant the Visitors</i>

90
00:06:43,422 --> 00:06:45,987
<i>full freedom of movement
within our Nation's borders.</i>

91
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:48,588
<i>There's been much debate
over the last few weeks as to...</i>

92
00:06:48,713 --> 00:06:51,128
Establishing ties with the Visitors

93
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,077
is a good thing, Jack.

94
00:06:53,365 --> 00:06:55,472
More souls to save.
You'll see.

95
00:06:55,772 --> 00:06:58,047
<i>Though high ranking Visitors
have been granted limited..., </i>

96
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,996
The police came by last night.
They wanted to talk to you about that

97
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,461
poor man who was stabbed
to death yesterday.

98
00:07:03,586 --> 00:07:05,318
Said they'd be back this morning.

99
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,420
You left your gun in my car.

100
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,668
It's Paul. Have you seen Dale?

101
00:07:42,205 --> 00:07:43,205
Dale?

102
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:46,502
Not since yesterday. Why?

103
00:07:46,642 --> 00:07:48,948
<i>I need you to get in here.
He's missing.</i>

104
00:07:55,688 --> 00:07:56,988
Last night was great.

105
00:07:58,368 --> 00:07:59,548
Better than great.

106
00:08:01,907 --> 00:08:03,326
You know, maybe I should

107
00:08:03,977 --> 00:08:05,626
hide rings all over the house.

108
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:12,827
How's your arm?

109
00:08:15,046 --> 00:08:18,103
You think I'm gonna let some scratch
from filing cabinet get the best of me?

110
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:34,663
<i>Hey, hon,</i>

111
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:37,954
<i>there's some, ointment
in the medicine chest if you need it.</i>

112
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,417
Thanks, baby,

113
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:41,627
but it's not that bad.

114
00:08:44,844 --> 00:08:47,685
<i>And please feel free to ask
anything and everything.</i>

115
00:08:48,173 --> 00:08:50,352
<i>I'm here to discuss all
topics without reserve.</i>

116
00:08:54,582 --> 00:08:57,266
<i>And please feel free to ask
anything and everything.</i>

117
00:08:57,823 --> 00:08:59,868
<i>I'm here to discuss all
topics without reserve.</i>

118
00:08:59,993 --> 00:09:01,004
Morning.

119
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:03,794
You're in rly.

120
00:09:05,187 --> 00:09:06,763
Just watching the interview.

121
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,089
Why are you beating
yourself up over this?

122
00:09:11,153 --> 00:09:13,378
Because my dad's not here
do it for me?

123
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,631
If you'd gone after anna on the air,
you'd never get access again.

124
00:09:18,318 --> 00:09:20,516
80 million viewers
watched you last night.

125
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:23,580
80 million watched Anna.

126
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:33,991
- No formal response yet from India.
- Be pient.

127
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,199
The US is the Lynchpin.

128
00:09:36,685 --> 00:09:38,159
Once they grant us freedom,

129
00:09:38,353 --> 00:09:40,218
the remaining countries will follow.

130
00:09:44,692 --> 00:09:47,730
I'm told in Japan, the conveys both
a respect for tradition

131
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,115
and the allure of submission.

132
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,870
I'm not sure that's
the message you want to send.

133
00:09:56,865 --> 00:09:58,730
You still don't understand humanity.

134
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:01,548
Team <i>Lézards</i>

135
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,751

00:10:05,503 --> 00:10:08,993
VO By:
<i>¤Aka¤</i>, kaiser66, <i>Visitor#Kµ</i>

137
00:11:01,768 --> 00:11:02,944
We're ready for ya.

138
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:05,497
His wife's pretty upset.

139
00:11:05,811 --> 00:11:07,376
She's been here a couple hours.

140
00:11:08,722 --> 00:11:10,377
Dale never made it home last night.

141
00:11:10,502 --> 00:11:12,642
She says he always calls,
even on stakeout.

142
00:11:13,646 --> 00:11:16,768
Timing's terrible. Half my team's been
reassigned to this visitor task force.

143
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:19,052
I don't really care
about the visitors right now.

144
00:11:19,615 --> 00:11:21,430
We're all worried about Dale.

145
00:11:21,955 --> 00:11:24,349
Any agent goes missing,
it's a big deal.

146
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:28,040
You wanna ask me anything
before we go in?

147
00:11:28,574 --> 00:11:30,254
It's just a few questions, right?

148
00:11:42,246 --> 00:11:44,661
Agent evans, please. Have a seat.

149
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:01,640
Father Jack Landry?

150
00:12:02,415 --> 00:12:03,889
I'm special agent Sarita Malik

151
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,146
with the FBI Visitor Threat
Assessment joint Task force.

152
00:12:07,545 --> 00:12:08,643
That's a mouthful.

153
00:12:10,132 --> 00:12:12,912
Can I as you some questions
about the man who died here yesterday?

154
00:12:14,102 --> 00:12:16,026
You were the last person
to talk to him.

155
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:19,925
I was expecting the police,
not the FBI.

156
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,018
The victim was on a bureau list.

157
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,213
He made dozens of calls to us
over the years

158
00:12:24,338 --> 00:12:26,149
about a supposed alien invasion.

159
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,463
Remember when that was crazy talk?

160
00:12:29,225 --> 00:12:31,027
There's still plenty of crazy
out there.

161
00:12:31,152 --> 00:12:33,635
We've logged thousands of calls
like his over the years.

162
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,254
It's just now we have to
pay attention to them.

163
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:39,092
Makes sense.

164
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,886
- We really appreciate your help.
- Of course. Where do you want to start?

165
00:12:43,266 --> 00:12:45,138
The last time you saw
agent Maddox was...

166
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,392
Around 9:00 last night. We grabbed
some dinner, then he dropped me off.

167
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,615
His wife said you
were working together.

168
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:53,438
That's true. Then we grabbed dinner,
then he dropped me off.

169
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,649
Had you ever seen him
before yesterday?

170
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,151
I don't think so.

171
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,611
You sure?

172
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,390
No, I don't think.
Not before yesterday.

173
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,617
Were you aware
of any marital problems?

174
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,285
He loves Joselyn.

175
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,246
Any drug or alcohol issues?

176
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,309
Dale doesn't even drink.

177
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,444
So he didn't come here to see you?

178
00:13:12,979 --> 00:13:16,128
People come to see priests
all the time. I'm a priest, so...

179
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,796
Did he say anything
about the visitors?

180
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,529
Take this and go to this address

181
00:13:21,654 --> 00:13:23,260
and give it to the people there.

182
00:13:25,818 --> 00:13:26,873
He just...

183
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,808
- He seemed really scared.
- Stressed out?

184
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,643
There's a spacheship above the city.

185
00:13:31,953 --> 00:13:35,021
He's been my partner for seven years.
He's always had my back.

186
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,315
Were the two of you
romantically involved?

187
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,776
We have to ask.

188
00:13:40,055 --> 00:13:41,736
Dale's like a brother to me, so no.

189
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:45,157
How much more of this do we have?
Dale's missing.

190
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,908
I'd like to look for him.

191
00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:49,756
I have a few more questions.

192
00:13:54,193 --> 00:13:56,376
Paul? What's going on?

193
00:13:57,395 --> 00:13:58,662
They found Dale's car.

194
00:14:17,348 --> 00:14:19,389
- What?
- That address.

195
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:21,658
- Mean something to you?
- It came up

196
00:14:21,783 --> 00:14:23,690
in an investigation
into a terrorist cell.

197
00:14:23,815 --> 00:14:27,115
- Maybe dale was looking into it.
- And you didn't think to tell me this?

198
00:14:27,996 --> 00:14:30,035
Nobody in or out until we get the
all clear.

199
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,037
There's possible suspects in there.

200
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,444
Get on the radios.
Stay on the radios.

201
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:36,397
If we need backup, we'll call NYPD.

202
00:14:36,522 --> 00:14:38,676
Nobody gets hurt.
Everybody stays aware.

203
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:50,027
Find anything?

204
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,733
Dale's phone.

209
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,022
<i>And we wait with great anticipation</i>

210
00:15:17,147 --> 00:15:18,874
<i>for russia, india</i>

211
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:21,241
<i>and the United States
to follow their lead.</i>

212
00:15:21,366 --> 00:15:23,679
- Really?
- <i>Hopefully, a decision is forthcoming.</i>

213
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:27,849
<i>Until then, we are of peace always.</i>

214
00:15:31,746 --> 00:15:32,889
Poll numbers.

215
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,808
Country's split about the visitors.

216
00:15:36,245 --> 00:15:37,727
50% are still undecided.

217
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:39,938
People don't have enough info.

218
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:42,324
That's my fault.

219
00:15:42,905 --> 00:15:45,610
I didn't ask anna the hard
questions. I got played.

220
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,571
- Chad, we talked about this.
- I know,

221
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,823
but I need to show Anna
she's not the only one

222
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:51,531
who can get what she wants.

223
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,035
You gonna ask another interview?

224
00:15:55,558 --> 00:15:57,166
I don't need Anna.

225
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:01,553
When I'm done,
she'll be the one calling me.

226
00:16:08,398 --> 00:16:09,401
What's this?

227
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:12,462
I want you to give me this ring
in your own time,

228
00:16:13,421 --> 00:16:14,750
when you're ready.

229
00:16:16,315 --> 00:16:18,672
I'm still mad at myself
for not trusting you.

230
00:16:19,482 --> 00:16:21,118
I was sneaking around

231
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:23,410
buying you this engagement ring.

232
00:16:26,663 --> 00:16:29,707
Like I said, give it to me
in your own time.

233
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:39,539
I had a client cancel today.
Wanna meet for lunch?

234
00:16:40,756 --> 00:16:44,588
I wish I could, sweetheart, but I
have to go out to Jersey for a meeting.

235
00:16:45,143 --> 00:16:46,225
Rain check?

236
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,235
I still can't believe
you joined up last night.

237
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,847
Dude, you've got
some serious brass clankers.

238
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:05,069
- Keep it down around my mom.
- What? About the brass clankers?

239
00:17:05,597 --> 00:17:08,228
No, dumb-ass. About me joining.

240
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,199
My mom doesn't get it, man.
Dhe'd totally freak.

241
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:14,866
Mine, too. Must be a parent thing.

242
00:17:17,942 --> 00:17:21,353
Seriously, who doesn't wanna hang out
with someone from another planet?

243
00:17:21,478 --> 00:17:22,376
I know.

244
00:17:27,697 --> 00:17:29,676
That jacket
looks really good on you.

245
00:17:31,462 --> 00:17:32,467
Thanks.

246
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:35,595
I remember you. Brandon, right?

247
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:40,183
Tyler told me you wanted
to become a peace ambassador.

248
00:17:40,452 --> 00:17:42,060
The thought crossed my mind.

249
00:17:44,374 --> 00:17:45,438
Come on.

250
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,327
Let's see if we can get you
to the front of the line.

251
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:49,943
This way.

252
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:52,398
Two words man. Awe. Some.

253
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:58,003
Is everything all right?

254
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:03,665
I'm not sure I did
the right thing, father.

255
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,666
The man who died
was ranting about the visitors.

256
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,339
I should've mentioned that.

257
00:18:09,193 --> 00:18:12,402
That poor soul
was clearly disturbed.

258
00:18:12,527 --> 00:18:15,118
Didn't the FBI agent say as much?

259
00:18:15,754 --> 00:18:17,951
She wasn't just with the fbi.
She was...

260
00:18:18,235 --> 00:18:20,566
with the Visitor Threat
Assessment joint Task force.

261
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:24,104
Tread carefully, Jack.

262
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,662
There are sensitive talks going on

263
00:18:26,787 --> 00:18:29,064
between our government
and the visitors.

264
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:32,572
You wouldn't want to upset
the applecart now, would ya?

265
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,668
I'm sure you're doing
the right thing.

266
00:18:48,743 --> 00:18:50,660
You never answered
my question before.

267
00:18:51,762 --> 00:18:53,882
Why this the first time I'm
hearing about this warehouse?

268
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,435
We were afraid there was a mole.

269
00:18:56,752 --> 00:18:58,633
Someone kept typing off
the cells we were tracking.

270
00:18:58,758 --> 00:19:00,430
I guess dale came here
to investigate.

271
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,658
Why would he do that alone?

272
00:19:03,362 --> 00:19:04,893
Didn't he trust you?

273
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:08,521
I've kind of had enough, sir.

274
00:19:08,869 --> 00:19:11,065
The questions, the tone.

275
00:19:11,386 --> 00:19:15,278
My partner, my friend
could be out there somewhere.

276
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:17,572
Then go find him.

277
00:19:20,597 --> 00:19:22,691
Canvass the area!

278
00:19:22,816 --> 00:19:24,934
Get in touch with justice, DEA, ATF.

279
00:19:31,496 --> 00:19:34,547
Do we know if any of these people are
from the first attempt at a resistance?

280
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:38,051
Not yet, but we'll get
the information from him.

281
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,096
I want answers.

282
00:19:43,135 --> 00:19:46,559
Who else was with you
in the warehouse?

283
00:19:47,402 --> 00:19:50,868
Give me the names, and I'll make
the snakes go away.

284
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:54,108
I don't know.
I never saw them before.

285
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:57,821
Make it stop!

286
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,412
He was the only human
we captured alive.

287
00:20:07,301 --> 00:20:09,290
A new resistance
would be unacceptable.

288
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,252
I want names.

289
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:34,051
Hello?

290
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:38,803
Hello?

291
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,742
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Angelo.

292
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,659
Don't know any Angelo.

293
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,329
Angelo Russo.

294
00:20:51,244 --> 00:20:52,699
Never heard of him.

295
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:05,116
I told you never come back.

296
00:21:06,002 --> 00:21:07,857
I missed you, too, Angelo.

297
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:19,968
Jack?

298
00:21:21,771 --> 00:21:23,990
- What are you doing here?
- I work here.

299
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:27,535
- You're an FBI agent?
- You're a freakin' priest?

300
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,058
Father Landry?
We're ready for you.

301
00:21:34,597 --> 00:21:36,377
What are you doing here?

302
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,649
Upsetting the applecart.

303
00:21:41,045 --> 00:21:42,236
You two know each other?

304
00:21:42,361 --> 00:21:43,393
- No.
- Yes.

305
00:21:43,763 --> 00:21:45,053
We just met.

306
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:49,874
Father?

307
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:58,296
Malik.

308
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,485
What's the priest doing here?

309
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,591
He's got info on a murder.

310
00:22:35,926 --> 00:22:37,466
And that's my bike.

311
00:22:38,134 --> 00:22:40,481
And that's my bike in Tompkins Park.

312
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:43,820
- And, that's me and my bike.
- You really like your bike.

313
00:22:47,373 --> 00:22:48,771
That's Verducci's pizza.

314
00:22:48,938 --> 00:22:50,742
That's the best slice in the city.

315
00:22:51,543 --> 00:22:52,745
You ever had pizza?

316
00:22:55,758 --> 00:22:58,793
You're gonna love it. I'll take you
there as soon as they let you out.

317
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,088
What makes you think
I'd go anywhere with you?

318
00:23:08,665 --> 00:23:10,471
You space girls are funny.

319
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:13,349
You were joking, right?

320
00:23:14,469 --> 00:23:15,733
Can I see that?

321
00:23:23,552 --> 00:23:24,992
Did I do it right?

322
00:23:29,926 --> 00:23:30,944
Perfect.

323
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,308
Whoops!

324
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,789
What are you gonna do
about it, V boy?

325
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,891
What are you gonna
do about it, V lover?

326
00:23:42,016 --> 00:23:44,831
- Wait, Tyler.
- You got a problem, man?

327
00:23:46,332 --> 00:23:48,885
You're the one with the problem.
Your boy's littering.

328
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,595
Let's just forget about this Ty.

329
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:53,368
You always make
your girlfriend do the talkin'?

330
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,957
The peace ambassador
just punched a guy!

331
00:24:02,293 --> 00:24:04,609
Dude, you got
a little somethin' right there.

332
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,630
Lisa!

333
00:24:20,888 --> 00:24:24,661
Heard something about a fight
at a warehouse in Brooklyn last night.

334
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:27,232
Little bird told you?

335
00:24:27,836 --> 00:24:29,759
I keep my ear to the ground.

336
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:32,386
How do you think
I stayed alive this long?

337
00:24:32,815 --> 00:24:35,006
Can't believe you're involved
in that again.

338
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,016
You should be hiding.

339
00:24:37,332 --> 00:24:38,229
I was.

340
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,979
Then I got a phone call.

341
00:24:41,236 --> 00:24:42,605
Remember Georgie?

342
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:44,844
Yeah, I remember him.

343
00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:47,193
Guy's a hothead.
He'll get you killed.

344
00:24:48,402 --> 00:24:49,320
Maybe,

345
00:24:49,646 --> 00:24:51,490
but I can't walk away.

346
00:24:52,754 --> 00:24:54,367
Looked up in the sky lately?

347
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:57,166
- Wasn't suppose to happen yet.
- But it has.

348
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,320
And whatever they're
gonna do to the humans,

349
00:25:00,445 --> 00:25:03,331
it's nothing compared to what they'll do
to traitors like me and you.

350
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,629
Take my advice, head for the hills.

351
00:25:06,884 --> 00:25:07,786
I can't.

352
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:11,092
There's a woman.

353
00:25:13,244 --> 00:25:14,053
Human.

354
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:17,807
Oh, God. Don't tell me
you're in love with her.

355
00:25:31,598 --> 00:25:34,095
You know anybody looking to
get back into the fight?

356
00:25:34,431 --> 00:25:36,437
That's really why you came,
isn't it?

357
00:25:37,481 --> 00:25:39,162
Just give me some names.

358
00:25:40,943 --> 00:25:42,827
I know there's some others.

359
00:25:55,994 --> 00:25:57,292
I'm sorry, Ryan.

360
00:25:57,417 --> 00:26:00,112
I can't trust you.
I can't trust anyone.

361
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,433
This way, father.

362
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,687
You gave them the pictures.
What the hell were you thinking?

363
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,589
I wanted to do the right thing.

364
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:24,826
The right thing?
Stick to preaching.

365
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:28,307
A man died giving me those pictures.
I gave them to the task force

366
00:26:28,432 --> 00:26:29,962
'cause I thought they could help.

367
00:26:30,087 --> 00:26:31,839
They're supposed to be on our side.

368
00:26:32,165 --> 00:26:34,491
So was my partner.
Look where that got us.

369
00:26:34,616 --> 00:26:36,827
What if those photos
can stop the government

370
00:26:36,952 --> 00:26:38,920
from getting into bed
with the visitors?

371
00:26:39,045 --> 00:26:42,458
What part of "don't trust
anyone" did you not understand?

372
00:26:42,703 --> 00:26:45,519
You walked away from me last night.
What the hell was I supposed to do?

373
00:26:50,132 --> 00:26:52,018
Don't trust anyone?
You got it.

374
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:00,725
Evans.

375
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:02,631
My office, now.

376
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,457
Sit down.

377
00:27:11,158 --> 00:27:15,091
I just keep wondering why Dale would go
into that warehouse all by himself.

378
00:27:15,903 --> 00:27:16,913
Me, too.

379
00:27:18,487 --> 00:27:21,209
Any idea why your case notes
and his aren't matching up?

380
00:27:21,334 --> 00:27:22,723
What are you talking about?

381
00:27:24,469 --> 00:27:27,395
I want you to tell me why
you're lying about last night.

382
00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:29,647
I'm not lying.

383
00:27:30,012 --> 00:27:30,884
Really?

384
00:27:34,108 --> 00:27:37,706
<i>Oh, my gosh. It's a massacre.
They're killing people.</i>

385
00:27:37,831 --> 00:27:40,473
<i>- Slow down, ma'am. Where are you?
- It's a warehouse...</i>

386
00:27:40,598 --> 00:27:43,623
<i>4400 Pier avenue, Brooklyn.
Please send the police.</i>

387
00:27:43,748 --> 00:27:46,247
<i>I'm contacting dispatch now.
How many people were killed?</i>

388
00:27:46,553 --> 00:27:47,873
<i>I don't know, a lot.</i>

389
00:27:55,095 --> 00:27:56,765
Tell me that's not you.

390
00:28:05,855 --> 00:28:08,352
I was at the warehouse.
I made the call.

391
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,357
You lied to me.

392
00:28:10,661 --> 00:28:13,467
You could have compromised
this entire investigation.

393
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:16,485
- Erica, explain this to me or...
- I think that dale is working

394
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,863
with one of the terrorist groups
we were investigating.

395
00:28:19,184 --> 00:28:20,573
Dale's a traitor?

396
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:23,276
I couldn't accuse him
without hard evidence,

397
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:26,701
so I followed him to the warehouse.
I saw him meet with them.

398
00:28:26,826 --> 00:28:28,247
You never called for backup?

399
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,754
If I was wrong,

400
00:28:29,879 --> 00:28:32,126
I could have blown
a legitimate investigation.

401
00:28:32,487 --> 00:28:34,337
So I called 9-1-1.

402
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:36,870
If Dale needed help,
he would get it,

403
00:28:36,995 --> 00:28:39,759
If he didn't, I would get
backup. But it didn't work.

404
00:28:40,032 --> 00:28:43,652
- They never showed.
- No, they never showed,

405
00:28:43,777 --> 00:28:46,622
because the emergency call center
has no record of your 9-1-1.

406
00:28:46,747 --> 00:28:48,225
You just played it for me.

407
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:50,268
I got this recording from D. E. A

408
00:28:50,393 --> 00:28:53,606
Every pay phone around that warehouse
is tapped for a smuggling crackdown,

409
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:56,912
and it's the only reason I even
half believe you right now.

410
00:28:57,548 --> 00:29:00,714
If they're tampering
with 9-1-1 calls,

411
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,573
then this goes deeper
than I thought.

412
00:29:04,366 --> 00:29:05,826
You know how all this sounds?

413
00:29:06,452 --> 00:29:08,162
Awesome and airtight?

414
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,166
Dale is a traitor.

415
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,087
I don't like it
any more than you do.

416
00:29:16,869 --> 00:29:18,253
But I'll prove it.

417
00:29:19,371 --> 00:29:21,050
I just need some time.

418
00:29:26,117 --> 00:29:26,998
Okay.

419
00:29:31,698 --> 00:29:33,815
I just hope to hell you're wrong.

420
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,556
Good afternoon.
I'm Chad Decker.

421
00:29:41,681 --> 00:29:45,685
Today "prime focus" takes a look at
the question that's on everyone's minds.

422
00:29:46,127 --> 00:29:48,428
Do the visitors deserve our trust?

423
00:29:48,651 --> 00:29:50,663
Are they the saviors
they'd have us believe,

424
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:53,791
or are we in danger of rushing
to a premature judgment?

425
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,604
<i>Joining me in the discussion are</i>

426
00:29:55,729 --> 00:29:57,741
<i>congressman Harold Stern,
a Pro-V advocate,</i>

427
00:29:57,866 --> 00:30:00,756
<i>and Marion Geiger
taking the Anti-V position.</i>

428
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:04,658
Marion, let's start with you.
Why exactly don't you trust the v's?

429
00:30:15,316 --> 00:30:18,107
I'm sorry. I can't stop thinking
about what you said...

430
00:30:18,643 --> 00:30:21,117
- that I walked away from you.
- I'm kinda busy.

431
00:30:21,242 --> 00:30:23,813
I know. But you were trying
to do the right thing.

432
00:30:23,938 --> 00:30:26,907
If you're trying to apologize,
fine. You're forgiven.

433
00:30:27,297 --> 00:30:28,977
- Excuse me.
- I just keep thinking

434
00:30:29,102 --> 00:30:32,046
about all of these years,
all of the people that Dale fooled.

435
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:35,291
Not just me, his friends,
our friends, his wife.

436
00:30:37,442 --> 00:30:38,169
A wife?

437
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:41,755
She's a visitor, too?

438
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:42,881
I don't know.

439
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,576
They lived together, slept together.

440
00:30:45,966 --> 00:30:47,913
She saw him at his most vulnerable.

441
00:30:48,038 --> 00:30:50,556
Even if she's not, she might
know something that can help us.

442
00:30:51,253 --> 00:30:53,176
"Us"? No.

443
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,102
I'm done.

444
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,273
I'm taking your advice. Remember
what you said? "Go home. Act normal."

445
00:31:00,948 --> 00:31:02,860
There is no normal anymore.

446
00:31:04,836 --> 00:31:06,113
I need your help.

447
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:12,620
Erica, you're an FBI agent.
I am just...

448
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:16,415
I don't know.

449
00:31:17,557 --> 00:31:19,668
You're the only person I can trust.

450
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:24,340
I'm sorry. No.

451
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,551
If I'm gonna do any good,
it is here.

452
00:31:36,321 --> 00:31:39,788
We checked dale's phone records.
We couldn't find any calls to you.

453
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:46,195
He had a personal phone.

454
00:31:46,826 --> 00:31:50,151
Said he wanted to keep work
and family separate.

455
00:31:53,934 --> 00:31:56,221
I came across these
a few months ago.

456
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,126
All of these calls,
they're to two numbers?

457
00:32:02,702 --> 00:32:05,183
Yes. That one's mine, and...

458
00:32:07,488 --> 00:32:09,652
He called that other one a lot.

459
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:15,224
Have you noticed anything?
Has dale been acting oddlately?

460
00:32:16,007 --> 00:32:17,521
You know my husband.

461
00:32:18,902 --> 00:32:20,617
He gets lost in work sometimes.

462
00:32:20,742 --> 00:32:21,934
He can be distant.

463
00:32:22,456 --> 00:32:24,984
Did the visitors'arrival have
anything to do with it?

464
00:32:26,468 --> 00:32:27,532
Maybe.

465
00:32:28,975 --> 00:32:32,299
Everyone's life has changed
in some way since they got here,

466
00:32:32,424 --> 00:32:34,118
all the excitement.

467
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:07,610
All of dale's calls went to the same
trunk line, dead end by design.

468
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:08,812
Untracable.

469
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,364
There is something we can trace
the pattern of the calls.

470
00:33:13,156 --> 00:33:14,825
Every time we went to nail

471
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,619
this terrorist cell,

472
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:20,015
Dale would make a tip-off call
to thisnumber, 20-30 minutes before.

473
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:24,015
I ran it all down,
number by number, case by case.

474
00:33:26,118 --> 00:33:28,422
I just can't believe Dale
crawled to the other side.

475
00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:32,746
You can't believe it?
Seven years, joined at the hip.

476
00:33:35,438 --> 00:33:37,097
The scary thing is
he's still in the wind.

477
00:33:41,306 --> 00:33:43,506
I don't think
he'll show his face again.

478
00:34:02,523 --> 00:34:03,490
Angelo?

479
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:09,145
What's with the drugs?
- I can't trust anyone.

480
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,215
- I had to check you out.
- And?

481
00:34:11,504 --> 00:34:14,718
If you really care about this woman,
get as far away from her as possible.

482
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,482
That's not gonna happen, okay?

483
00:34:16,607 --> 00:34:18,722
I can protect her,
so I'm not going anywhere.

484
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,898
- You sure about that?
- Yeah, 100%.

485
00:34:21,023 --> 00:34:23,602
Valerie Stevens, psychotherapist,

486
00:34:24,013 --> 00:34:27,272
works at graden medical,
598 east 35th street.

487
00:34:27,585 --> 00:34:28,962
She grew up in detroit,

488
00:34:29,256 --> 00:34:31,781
Father was an autoworker,
mother a homemaker.

489
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,153
She graduated NYU

490
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,571
she has a heart condition.

491
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:36,240
Did you do something to her?

492
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,870
No. I wouldn't touch her.

493
00:34:39,092 --> 00:34:42,246
But they will, if they find her,
and if I can do it, so can they.

494
00:34:43,293 --> 00:34:44,885
You say you really love her?

495
00:34:46,249 --> 00:34:48,228
You real want to put her
in the cross fire?

496
00:34:57,237 --> 00:34:58,715
They won't let me in.

497
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:01,995
I know.

498
00:35:03,448 --> 00:35:05,964
The counsel wants to kick you
out of the ambassador program.

499
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,146
What?

500
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:10,201
Your country is nervous
about us as it is.

501
00:35:10,326 --> 00:35:11,608
If youwear that jacket.

502
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,153
Listen. Tell me what to do,
and I'll do it.

503
00:35:14,573 --> 00:35:16,192
I'm already in trouble.

504
00:35:17,653 --> 00:35:19,661
I'm the one that recommended you.

505
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:21,452
It's up to the counsel now.

506
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,826
Good-bye, Tyler.

507
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:40,825
This was nothing less than
a complete abrogation of our agreement.

508
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,860
Abrogation? Nice.

509
00:35:43,318 --> 00:35:45,500
You have one of those
word-a-day calendars?

510
00:35:46,758 --> 00:35:48,361
We'll be looking for a journalist

511
00:35:48,486 --> 00:35:50,539
who knows better than to bite
the hand that feeds him.

512
00:35:56,726 --> 00:35:59,532
I didn't hurt you with my show today.
I helped.

513
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:01,784
The public trusts me.

514
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:04,036
Watch the tape. Sure,

515
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:06,543
there were pros and cons,
but in the end,

516
00:36:06,753 --> 00:36:07,965
I made people feel

517
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,628
comfortable with the idea
of embracing diplomatic relations.

518
00:36:11,323 --> 00:36:12,795
You really believe that.

519
00:36:13,259 --> 00:36:14,570
Check the insta-polls.

520
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,299
You got a nice uptick
right after my show.

521
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,633
And you did that because you have
our best interests at heart?

522
00:36:23,158 --> 00:36:25,243
I can't control
what our government does,

523
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:29,276
but I can and do influence
public opinion, and in the end,

524
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,438
that's what'll make the difference.

525
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,132
I did this to help you,
and it's working.

526
00:36:35,188 --> 00:36:37,277
Are you done preening, Mr. Decker?

527
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,582
Not quite.

528
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,989
This one was a freebie.

529
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:43,854
The next time you want my help,

530
00:36:44,276 --> 00:36:45,728
it'll be on my terms.

531
00:36:59,424 --> 00:37:00,981
After weeks of investigation,

532
00:37:01,106 --> 00:37:03,176
the state department announced
moments ago

533
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:05,120
the united states and the visitors

534
00:37:05,245 --> 00:37:08,038
have agreed to the commencement
of diplomatic relations.

535
00:37:08,163 --> 00:37:11,478
As a first step, a limited number
of visitors will be able

536
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:15,494
to apply for visas that will allow them
to travel freely within our borders.

537
00:37:16,183 --> 00:37:18,460
We are going to take you now
to the visitor mother ship

538
00:37:18,585 --> 00:37:19,593
over manhattan,

539
00:37:19,718 --> 00:37:22,946
where the V high commander Anna
is addressing the crowds below.

540
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,313
<i>On behalf of all visitors,</i>

541
00:37:26,438 --> 00:37:29,305
<i>I want to extend my warmest appreciation
to the United States.</i>

542
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:32,464
<i>We are humbled
by the generous faith,</i>

543
00:37:32,589 --> 00:37:35,844
<i>the courage and the good will
you've demonstrated.</i>

544
00:37:36,566 --> 00:37:38,174
<i>Thank you for your trust.</i>

545
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,628
<i>It will be rewarded.</i>

546
00:37:40,753 --> 00:37:42,755
<i>We are of peace always.</i>

547
00:37:43,644 --> 00:37:45,637
It's a great blessing.

548
00:38:02,751 --> 00:38:04,656
I just wanted to thank you.

549
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:08,197
You're welcome.

550
00:38:08,839 --> 00:38:11,126
And listen, maybe...

551
00:38:25,314 --> 00:38:27,054
You undercover, father?

552
00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:29,180
Just off duty.

553
00:38:29,592 --> 00:38:31,844
Do you want to walk with me?

554
00:38:34,233 --> 00:38:37,021
When I heard the announcement
about the visitors,

555
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,070
- It made me feel...
- Sick to your stomach? Me, too.

556
00:38:43,255 --> 00:38:46,009
You know we can't win this war
picking them off one at a time.

557
00:38:46,134 --> 00:38:48,911
"We"? I didn't know
that you reenlisted.

558
00:38:50,381 --> 00:38:53,516
This afternoon I was afraid of what
I might have to do if I got involved.

559
00:38:54,645 --> 00:38:57,894
But the only thing that scares
the hell out of me now is doing nothing.

560
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,430
That's the second time
I've heard you curse.

561
00:39:05,664 --> 00:39:08,295
Must be hanging out
with the wrong kind of people.

562
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:13,932
Diplomatic relations with the visitors
isn't gonna make our job any easier.

563
00:39:14,057 --> 00:39:17,081
Neither is the fact that v task force
ignored the pictures I gave'em.

564
00:39:17,206 --> 00:39:19,398
There are probably visitors
on the v task force.

565
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,358
They could be anywhere.

566
00:39:24,437 --> 00:39:25,737
At least we have this.

567
00:39:27,788 --> 00:39:28,774
What's that?

568
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:32,327
I swiped it from the v task force.

569
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,454
Anyone and everyone who's ever

570
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,832
contacted the FBI
about aliens or visitors.

571
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,393
Maybe we can find other people
who want to fight,

572
00:39:39,736 --> 00:39:41,586
even some people from the warehouse.

573
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:44,798
We can't be the only ones
who know the truth.

574
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:51,156
Say what you want about the visitors,
but the therapy business is booming.

575
00:39:55,598 --> 00:39:57,233
Can I look at your arm?

576
00:40:01,177 --> 00:40:02,232
It's not so bad.

577
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,630
See? I told you.

578
00:40:05,284 --> 00:40:06,612
It's almost healed.

579
00:40:09,955 --> 00:40:12,146
That's weird.
Did you do that?

580
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:15,647
The picture's upside down.

581
00:40:21,673 --> 00:40:22,658
Who's Cyrus?

582
00:40:23,934 --> 00:40:25,420
Some guy I used to know.

583
00:40:26,203 --> 00:40:28,097
Guy you used to know?

584
00:40:32,423 --> 00:40:33,285
Some guy...

585
00:40:33,822 --> 00:40:34,649
I used...

586
00:40:34,886 --> 00:40:35,932
to know.

587
00:40:50,987 --> 00:40:51,782
Come in.

588
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:00,248
Ty, thanks for keeping your promise

589
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,622
about the v's.

590
00:41:05,281 --> 00:41:07,980
Don't stay up too late,
even if it is for school.
