2
00:00:01,996 --> 00:00:04,018
Today we welcome
the first group of humans

3
00:00:04,143 --> 00:00:06,353
selected to participate
in our "Live Aboard" program.

4
00:00:06,615 --> 00:00:09,717
I'm moving up on that ship, mom.
There's nothing you can do about it.

5
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:12,203
Members of our race are
falling prey to human emotions.

6
00:00:12,328 --> 00:00:13,514
Everyone will be tested.

7
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,556
- You failed.
- The test has to be wrong.

8
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,644
I want you to investigate
the 5th Column.

9
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:20,603
My Intel says they were planning
a terrorist attack against the Visitors.

10
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,995
Anna's worried about a group
of resistance fighters.

11
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,899
If I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

12
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:27,902
I've started looking into the group.
I might have something for you.

13
00:00:31,357 --> 00:00:32,573
There it is! Hurry up!

14
00:00:46,593 --> 00:00:49,840
We've got 45 seconds to acquire
target or the battery's spent.

15
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:56,180
Do it!

16
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:30,272
Something's not right.

17
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:33,391
Jack, get back here!

18
00:01:33,516 --> 00:01:35,636
We gotta split now.
We don't have time for this.

19
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:47,824
God in heaven...

20
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,708
Got someplace to be, Evans?

21
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,617
Just trying to figure out
how to schedule the...

22
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,554
<i>Hold on.</i>

23
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,687
What's happening?

24
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,315
The cops are almost here.
We gotta get out of here.

25
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,039
There might be survivors.

26
00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:33,760
<i>You need to tell me
what you're seeing out there.</i>

27
00:02:34,661 --> 00:02:35,613
No survivors.

28
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:38,699
Jack, they're gone, mate.
We can't do nothing for them.

29
00:02:39,596 --> 00:02:40,896
What's going on?

30
00:02:41,184 --> 00:02:43,662
<i>Ryan, talk to me please.
What's going on?</i>

31
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:47,583
It wasn't a V tracker team
on that shuttle.

32
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:51,212
They were humans.

33
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:52,619
What?

34
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,760
Listen, Jack, come on!
We're going!

35
00:03:13,982 --> 00:03:16,890
Our shuttle was shot down,
as you expected it would.

36
00:03:17,311 --> 00:03:19,073
The human remains have been found.

37
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:21,984
There will be a strong public outcry.

38
00:03:22,873 --> 00:03:25,281
Human law enforcement
will take swift and immediate action

39
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:27,587
against those responsible
for this atrocity.

40
00:03:28,554 --> 00:03:29,625
5th Column.

41
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:39,868
12 HEURES PLUS TÔT

42
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,371
Ryan, it's Joshua.

43
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:09,091
What's going on, Joshua?

44
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,393
Since you stopped the soldier
that was sent after Val,

45
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,794
Anna knows that
the 5th Column's growing stronger.

46
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,213
<i>I've received word
from other 5th Column on the ship</i>

47
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,591
she's sending a shuttle down
filled with trackers

48
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,259
to locate those responsible.

49
00:04:20,563 --> 00:04:22,977
- Trackers? When?
- Today.

50
00:04:26,064 --> 00:04:27,600
<i>If those trackers hit the ground</i>

51
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,124
and disperse, it'll be impossible
to locate them all.

52
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:31,700
I can't let 'em hit the ground.

53
00:04:31,825 --> 00:04:33,731
We have to blow that shuttle up
before it lands.

54
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,873
No human technology
can knock one down.

55
00:04:35,998 --> 00:04:37,250
<i>But V technology could.</i>

56
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,905
If I could acquire a missile,

57
00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:42,948
could we alter it, so it could
breach a V shuttle's defenses?

58
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:47,953
Only if V code was uploaded to
the secret electronics in the missile's

59
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,914
- <i>computer chip.</i>
- Then get me that code.

60
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:53,000
You don't have much time.
You have to move fast.

61
00:05:02,683 --> 00:05:04,069
You're dropping your right.

62
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,643
- I suppose you could do better.
- I wouldn't want to embarrass you...

63
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,019
more.

64
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:15,439
Are you backing down
from a challenge?

65
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:18,209
I must be mistaken. I thought
you were Special Agent Erica Evans.

66
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:19,334
Really?

67
00:05:30,485 --> 00:05:33,165
- Need help with those gloves?
- I got it. Thanks.

68
00:05:38,575 --> 00:05:39,871
Step aside, priest.

69
00:05:56,811 --> 00:05:58,357
It's like "thorn birds" in here.

70
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:05,280
They let girls box here.

71
00:06:07,225 --> 00:06:09,244
Women, too, I've heard.

72
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,763
- You know the sport?
- I have four brothers.

73
00:06:12,216 --> 00:06:14,039
I learned a thing or two
about fighting.

74
00:06:14,646 --> 00:06:16,583
- Who's your favorite boxer?
- Sugar ray Leonard.

75
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:20,850
Lightning hands, fast on his feet,
good balance, never off his form.

76
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:23,674
You're bursting with opinions
this morning.

77
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:24,758
Who's yours?

78
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,725
We need to get our hands
on a stinger missile.

79
00:06:33,136 --> 00:06:35,436
- Finally some fun around here.
- What are you talking about?

80
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,813
Anna's sending down a shuttle
filled with V trackers

81
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,691
to hunt down those responsible
for stopping her soldier...

82
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,859
that would be us.

83
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:44,778
- Trackers?
- They have heightened senses.

84
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,489
They're like soldiers, but they blend in.
They could follow a scent,

85
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:51,285
- work a crime scene, evaluate evidence.
- Why not just send another soldier?

86
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,128
She will, but first,

87
00:06:53,253 --> 00:06:56,290
she'll send the trackers to identify us,
paint targets on our foreheads.

88
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:59,585
Then she'll send the soldiers to finish
us off. When's the shuttle coming?

89
00:07:00,006 --> 00:07:02,212
6:00.
But it's never gonna get here.

90
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,053
We're gonna blow it out the sky.

91
00:07:05,178 --> 00:07:06,761
What?
You can't be serious.

92
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:08,635
We're talking about
blowing up a shuttle?

93
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,013
No, we're talking about
blowing up a V shuttle.

94
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:13,840
But you're right to be worried.

95
00:07:13,965 --> 00:07:17,186
Strategically, we can't have 5th Column
coming off like terrorists.

96
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:20,308
We'll need to control
the public blowback.

97
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:23,692
There won't be any. The last thing
Anna wants is a big media mess,

98
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,362
FBI crawling all over the wreckage.
Not with the V remains on the site.

99
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:29,281
All she's gonna do

100
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,451
is say there was a shuttle malfunction
so they can clean it up.

101
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,537
Are we really considering this?
My son flies on those shuttles.

102
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,122
People fly on them.

103
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:39,209
How do we know
no one innocent will be hurt?

104
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,001
Joshua's already confirmed that

105
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,712
there's only gonna be V trackers
on those shuttles. No humans.

106
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,741
What if it lands
on a house or a school?

107
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,759
I know the flight plan.
It's landing in a remote location.

108
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:50,219
And make no mistake,

109
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,969
if that shuttle touches the ground,
we don't stand a chance.

110
00:07:53,094 --> 00:07:54,932
Those trackers... they will find us.

111
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,521
You want to risk your own life
over a fit of conscience, that's fine.

112
00:08:02,756 --> 00:08:03,960
How about Tyler's?

113
00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:06,806
Ryan, is your Intel good?

114
00:08:08,111 --> 00:08:08,987
Perfect.

115
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:12,981
Do it.

116
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,889

119
00:08:35,191 --> 00:08:36,593
Finding peace, Father?

120
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:40,269
Some days easier than others.

121
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:42,646
Even for a priest?

122
00:08:43,383 --> 00:08:44,833
For everyone, Chad.

123
00:08:48,115 --> 00:08:50,876
I've been on the ship a lot
since the last time we talked.

124
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:54,837
Anna has the live aboards eating
out of the palm of her hand.

125
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:57,200
And I know in my gut,

126
00:08:58,098 --> 00:09:00,244
it's not safe for them
to be so trusting.

127
00:09:01,877 --> 00:09:03,488
I want to join the fight.

128
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:08,839
I was hoping you could point me
to the 5th Column, like we said.

129
00:09:14,647 --> 00:09:17,439
It's been quiet, I'm afraid,
among my parishioners.

130
00:09:19,797 --> 00:09:21,097
Well, that's too bad.

131
00:09:23,734 --> 00:09:25,102
I could be very useful.

132
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,518
I'm behind the scenes with Anna.

133
00:09:28,626 --> 00:09:30,408
I travel with her and Marcus.

134
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:33,150
I have unrestricted access
to and from the mother ship.

135
00:09:35,466 --> 00:09:37,366
I even travel in the V-only shuttles.

136
00:09:38,732 --> 00:09:40,132
I overhear things.

137
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,531
You ride the V-only shuttles?

138
00:09:51,444 --> 00:09:53,489
I'm back and forth in them
all the time.

139
00:09:54,596 --> 00:09:57,084
I could be a big asset
to the 5th Column, Father.

140
00:09:57,209 --> 00:09:58,842
You riding the shuttles today?

141
00:09:59,075 --> 00:10:01,156
Yes.
Most days I do.

142
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:07,231
You should stay away
from the V-only shuttles today, Chad.

143
00:10:09,371 --> 00:10:10,849
What do you mean by that?

144
00:10:11,372 --> 00:10:14,279
Just whisper among the parishioners.
It might not be safe.

145
00:10:20,272 --> 00:10:21,203
I understand.

146
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:23,371
Thank you, Father.

147
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,185
- Are you all right?
- She had a nightmare last night.

148
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:47,113
About what?

149
00:10:48,669 --> 00:10:50,498
Here. I'll put her down for a nap.

150
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,642
It's no trouble.

151
00:10:59,974 --> 00:11:00,993
You can tell me.

152
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:05,028
In my dream,

153
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:08,041
I was being taken by doctors
down a dark corridor

154
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,362
here on the ship.

155
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:12,501
<i>And there were glowing arrows
on the ceiling.</i>

156
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,300
<i>I'm new to "Live Aboard"
and I'm scared.</i>

157
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,015
<i>I couldn't tell them to stop.</i>

158
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,325
And then there were needles,

159
00:11:20,024 --> 00:11:21,488
hundreds of them,

160
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,557
being poked into me,

161
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:25,299
all over.

162
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:28,979
<i>I know it was just a dream,
but I can't shake it.</i>

163
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:31,189
Can't shake what?

164
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:33,233
How real it felt.

165
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:45,479
You're all right.

166
00:11:47,536 --> 00:11:49,236
<i>It was just a nightmare.</i>

167
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:51,861
<i>You're safe up here.</i>

168
00:11:56,095 --> 00:11:58,546
I really enjoyed your report
on the "Live Aboard" program.

169
00:11:58,671 --> 00:12:01,053
- I just wanted to thank you.
- I'm glad you liked it.

170
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,554
I've been keeping my ear
to the ground,

171
00:12:05,898 --> 00:12:08,122
looking for any information
on the 5th Column

172
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:11,480
- what have you heard?
- There are whispers of a threat

173
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,275
to the shuttles
transporting Vs only today.

174
00:12:17,828 --> 00:12:20,572
You've come a long way
since we've arrived, Chad,

175
00:12:20,925 --> 00:12:22,112
professionally,

176
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,849
personally.

177
00:12:24,423 --> 00:12:26,443
You'd understand
that any threat to my people

178
00:12:26,568 --> 00:12:28,952
- is a threat to all of us.
- It might be nothing.

179
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,875
- I thought I should bring it up.
- Where did you learn this?

180
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,968
You have to understand
how this works.

181
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:37,673
I can get you this information
because my sources trust me.

182
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,091
I start naming names,

183
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:41,843
that'll choke off
the flow of information.

184
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:42,886
I understand.

185
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:45,305
But there's no need, Chad.

186
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,766
We don't have any V-only shuttles
running today.

187
00:12:51,076 --> 00:12:53,060
Will you please excuse us
for a moment?

188
00:12:53,675 --> 00:12:55,181
Actually, I was on my way out.

189
00:13:02,863 --> 00:13:05,117
We haven't eliminated
all 5th Column from the ship.

190
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,718
Someone leaked news
we were to send down on the shuttle.

191
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:13,041
I will look into this.

192
00:13:13,454 --> 00:13:15,669
I will tighten the flow
of information,

193
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:16,697
again.

194
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:19,418
In light of this threat,

195
00:13:19,543 --> 00:13:21,733
do you still want
to send down the trackers?

196
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,229
I have a better idea.

197
00:13:24,148 --> 00:13:26,537
If the 5th Column
wants to take down a shuttle,

198
00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:28,807
we'll let them.

199
00:13:39,814 --> 00:13:42,645
I've got the V code uploaded
into the missile electronics,

200
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,943
so assuming it does
what it's supposed to,

201
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,315
we're all systems go.

202
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,036
Guys... Ryan, are we sure
we really wanna do this?

203
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:52,414
You double-checked
your Intel with Joshua?

204
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,458
- You're sure?
- I'm positive.

205
00:13:54,697 --> 00:13:56,931
If we don't do this now,
it's gonna be too late.

206
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,197
We're running out of time,
let's do this.

207
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,516
Do it!

208
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:19,816
What's going on?

209
00:14:21,831 --> 00:14:24,054
It wasn't a V tracker team
on the shuttle.

210
00:14:26,228 --> 00:14:27,282
They were humans.

211
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:34,795
My God.

212
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:38,655
Pick up, baby.

213
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:40,550
Pick up, baby.
Come on.

214
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,631
Please, God.
Please pick up.

215
00:14:49,409 --> 00:14:50,314
You're okay?

216
00:14:51,472 --> 00:14:52,641
Mom, what's wrong?

217
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,142
A V shuttle went down.

218
00:14:54,383 --> 00:14:55,983
What? When?
Just now?

219
00:14:56,828 --> 00:14:59,441
... <i>The area just north
of Taconic State Parkway.</i>

220
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,408
<i>This possible terrorist attack
comes a mere three days</i>

221
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:04,861
<i>after the commencement
of the "Live Aboard" program.</i>

222
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,790
<i>Stunned and shocked people from...</i>

223
00:15:06,915 --> 00:15:09,074
- Lisa could have been there.
- I'm sure she's okay.

224
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:11,916
- How do you know, mom?
- I don't.

225
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,308
It went down in a secluded area,

226
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:18,083
Why would they send
peace ambassadors?

227
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,253
What if you're wrong about
who was on that shuttle?

228
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:09,843
How did this happen?

229
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,721
We need answers.

230
00:16:14,394 --> 00:16:15,557
I don't have any.

231
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:18,143
Joshua doesn't either.
He can to figure it out.

232
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,021
- Figure it out?
- Maybe he set us up.

233
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,273
You didn't hear his voice.

234
00:16:23,646 --> 00:16:25,014
He didn't set us up.

235
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:26,901
What, it was a mistake?

236
00:16:27,342 --> 00:16:28,653
It was the wrong shuttle?

237
00:16:29,437 --> 00:16:31,929
I asked you, Ryan.
I asked all of you.

238
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,289
We did everything that we
could have done.

239
00:16:34,414 --> 00:16:36,283
The odds are slim to none...

240
00:16:36,408 --> 00:16:38,538
I lived this in Iraq.
We won't use those excuses.

241
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,206
If we wage a war,

242
00:16:40,512 --> 00:16:42,251
if we strike preemptively,

243
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,251
we have zero margin of error.

244
00:16:44,376 --> 00:16:45,086
Zero.

245
00:16:46,508 --> 00:16:48,506
Either we value life
or we are the Vs.

246
00:16:48,786 --> 00:16:51,801
- No, it's not that simple.
- It is precisely that simple!

247
00:16:55,784 --> 00:16:57,140
Where are you with this?

248
00:16:58,168 --> 00:16:59,100
With you.

249
00:17:01,003 --> 00:17:03,772
You can't afford to be,
we've got other problems now.

250
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:06,966
We were all over that crime scene.
We were late getting out.

251
00:17:07,091 --> 00:17:08,468
The cops were on top of us.

252
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:11,738
It wasn't a clean getaway.
We might have left evidence.

253
00:17:13,841 --> 00:17:15,128
I won't do this anymore.

254
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:17,833
I'm out.

255
00:17:26,651 --> 00:17:27,945
Floyd Patterson.

256
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:28,785
What?

257
00:17:29,102 --> 00:17:30,395
My favorite boxer...

258
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,040
is Floyd Patterson.

259
00:17:33,358 --> 00:17:34,914
He got knocked down seven times

260
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,680
in one round against Johansson.

261
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,473
Seven times.

262
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:40,100
You know what he said?

263
00:17:41,676 --> 00:17:44,408
"They said I was the fighter
who got knocked down the most.

264
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,003
But I also got up the most."

265
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:50,997
So my question to you two is this...

266
00:17:51,698 --> 00:17:53,171
which do you want to be...

267
00:17:53,535 --> 00:17:55,225
the guy who gets knocked down...

268
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:58,114
Or the guy who gets back up?

269
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,248
Is Lisa okay?

270
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:13,697
I saw the footage
of the shuttle crash,

271
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,094
- and I thought if she was on it.
- Lisa's fine.

272
00:18:17,415 --> 00:18:19,588
Nothing was gonna keep you from her.

273
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:21,278
If she was gone, I...

274
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,393
I don't know what I'd do.

275
00:18:27,302 --> 00:18:28,830
I'm doing "Live Aboard."

276
00:18:30,434 --> 00:18:32,036
Lisa will be very pleased.

277
00:18:32,884 --> 00:18:34,070
I'll let her know.

278
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:36,366
Don't worry.

279
00:18:39,736 --> 00:18:40,905
Go home and pack.

280
00:18:41,285 --> 00:18:44,080
Soon enough, you'll be with her
all the time.

281
00:19:03,256 --> 00:19:04,095
Evans.

282
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,644
Where have you been?

283
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,355
My son is on the ship.
I had to track him down,

284
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,408
make sure he wasn't on the shuttle.

285
00:19:11,827 --> 00:19:13,610
- He's fine.
- Good.

286
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,851
I need every able body
on this thing.

287
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,444
Given our stance on terrorism,
this is a global embarrassment.

288
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:21,822
The evidence indicates domestic,

289
00:19:21,947 --> 00:19:23,780
and everything's pointing
to 5th Column.

290
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:25,906
What do we got?

291
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,582
Malik's working up a list

292
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,043
of people who could do this,
people against the Vs.

293
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:32,537
We picked up tread marks
on the trees,

294
00:19:32,662 --> 00:19:34,506
where we think
the terrorists parked.

295
00:19:34,768 --> 00:19:36,592
But not much else.
The shuttle's engines

296
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,677
run on blue energy,
highly explosive stuff.

297
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,179
when they blew up,
they left little forensic evidence.

298
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,654
Now the V on the dock

299
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:44,875
puts the number
between 15 and 20 people.

300
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,626
You've seen the remains.
We need a forensic anthropologist

301
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:51,239
to do the DNA work.
It could take weeks.

302
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:54,046
We shut down the highway
immediately after the crash,

303
00:19:55,296 --> 00:19:56,488
here and here,

304
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,905
they would have had to pass
through this tollbooth.

305
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:02,325
The good news?
Tollbooth has security cameras.

306
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:03,590
Nice.

307
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,665
We matched the tread
to 7 vehicle makes.

308
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,005
Once we pull footage,
we can cross-reference.

309
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:10,807
Let's get to work.

310
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,810
Can't reach Jack.
He wouldn't pick up.

311
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,604
We've got problems. What did you
drive on the scouting mission?

312
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,447
Jack's van,
we covered up the lettering.

313
00:20:33,572 --> 00:20:36,552
- You didn't drive through a tollbooth?
- Yeah, we had to.

314
00:20:36,743 --> 00:20:38,492
We stayed to check for survivors.

315
00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:40,864
Our escape route was compromised.

316
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,074
The tollbooth had security cameras.

317
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,660
The footage is on a live feed
to an off-site location.

318
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,180
<i>I'll text you the address.</i>

319
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,755
You and Hobbes better get there
and wipe the footage.

320
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,907
Make sure you get us the address.

321
00:20:58,212 --> 00:20:59,212
Smooth.

322
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,429
- One of the bones is smooth.
- You all right? What's going on?

323
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,599
Bones crack
when they're burned in the flesh.

324
00:21:08,721 --> 00:21:12,478
But bones from a skeleton
stay smooth in a fire.

325
00:21:13,633 --> 00:21:15,899
Why would there be a skeleton
on a shuttle full of tourists?

326
00:21:16,231 --> 00:21:17,295
There wouldn't.

327
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:21,905
They wouldn't put a skeleton
with humans. The other people...

328
00:21:24,072 --> 00:21:26,701
We didn't do this.
We didn't kill anyone.

329
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,828
The people there were already dead.

330
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,183
Anna set us up?

331
00:21:33,508 --> 00:21:35,126
You got photos of this,
hard evidence?

332
00:21:36,403 --> 00:21:38,578
I'm staring at my monitor right now.

333
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,178
It disappeared.

334
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,555
- Someone deleted it.
- <i>Disappeared?</i>

335
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:51,759
Who would cover up
something like that?

336
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,343
Cover the office.

337
00:22:01,468 --> 00:22:03,633
I'm rolling out
to grab that tollbooth footage.

338
00:22:03,758 --> 00:22:04,489
On it.

339
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,201
Ryan, the FBI just launched.
Get there and wipe that footage

340
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:11,572
before they do, or this is gonna
get pinned on us. Get moving now.

341
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,385
Get in there and short the server,
exactly like I showed you.

342
00:22:26,453 --> 00:22:28,203
<i>In 20 paces, make a left.</i>

343
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:31,766
<i>Keep going straight
down the hallway.</i>

344
00:22:38,665 --> 00:22:39,765
Bloody hell.

345
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:43,736
- Bloody hell what?
- FBI.

346
00:22:47,092 --> 00:22:48,324
I got it.
I'm here.

347
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,201
<i>You're about to get caught.</i>

348
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,792
<i>Get the hell out of there!</i>

349
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,978
<i>They're on top of you, get gone.</i>

350
00:23:16,091 --> 00:23:16,853
Damn it.

351
00:23:27,137 --> 00:23:28,569
You were protecting me

352
00:23:28,877 --> 00:23:30,604
by warning me about the shuttles,

353
00:23:31,673 --> 00:23:34,287
trying to save my life.
I was just passing on a rumor I heard.

354
00:23:35,195 --> 00:23:37,096
I didn't know that would happen.

355
00:23:37,528 --> 00:23:39,542
What exactly was
the 5th Column's plan?

356
00:23:40,236 --> 00:23:41,617
Why would they kill humans?

357
00:23:41,742 --> 00:23:45,021
I don't know any circumstances
under which they could condone that.

358
00:23:46,624 --> 00:23:49,552
I'm sure the 5th Column knows
what they're doing. I'm sure...

359
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,585
they know what's necessary.

360
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,465
And for me to be useful,
I have to do what's necessary, too.

361
00:23:58,362 --> 00:24:01,245
- Meaning?
- I have to report on this attack.

362
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:04,892
To keep my position
with Anna intact.

363
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:09,025
I can't seem sympathetic to the cause.
I have to come down hard.

364
00:24:10,986 --> 00:24:12,175
What I'm saying is,

365
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,243
if you're 5th Column,

366
00:24:14,783 --> 00:24:16,829
things are about to get
very bad for you.

367
00:24:20,218 --> 00:24:21,895
Good thing I'm not 5th Column.

368
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,891
Anna never saw it coming, you know.

369
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:34,065
She'd heard nothing

370
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,174
- about any threats...
- What, you asked her?

371
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,944
Indirectly, of course.

372
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:41,874
The 5th Column caught her off guard,

373
00:24:42,484 --> 00:24:43,884
which, believe me,

374
00:24:44,403 --> 00:24:45,603
is hard to do.

375
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,525
<i>We value life above all else,</i>

376
00:24:56,857 --> 00:24:58,575
<i>every single life.</i>

377
00:25:01,188 --> 00:25:03,565
The 5th Column reacted
exactly as I suspected.

378
00:25:05,192 --> 00:25:06,963
Shooting down
that shuttle backfired.

379
00:25:07,963 --> 00:25:09,925
Tonight they will be
introduced to the world

380
00:25:10,183 --> 00:25:12,954
just as I planned it, as terrorists.

381
00:25:15,868 --> 00:25:17,412
Mother, you wanted to see me?

382
00:25:17,663 --> 00:25:19,989
<i>We value life above all else,</i>

383
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:21,918
<i>every single life.</i>

384
00:25:22,043 --> 00:25:23,396
<i>We value life</i>

385
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:24,814
<i>above all else,</i>

386
00:25:25,425 --> 00:25:26,776
<i>every single life.</i>

387
00:25:28,726 --> 00:25:30,319
Which is more effective, Marcus?

388
00:25:32,983 --> 00:25:35,366
I think they're all sufficient.

389
00:25:38,718 --> 00:25:39,968
The second one.

390
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,080
It seems more sincere.

391
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,612
Your grasp of human emotion is...

392
00:25:50,704 --> 00:25:51,754
impressive.

393
00:25:55,238 --> 00:25:56,554
Thank you, mother.

394
00:26:11,096 --> 00:26:12,195
Are you all right?

395
00:26:13,874 --> 00:26:15,323
My faith is shaken, Father.

396
00:26:17,135 --> 00:26:18,159
Your faith in God?

397
00:26:20,343 --> 00:26:21,993
No, my faith in myself.

398
00:26:27,228 --> 00:26:28,678
In times like this,

399
00:26:30,303 --> 00:26:32,208
it's best to get back to basics,

400
00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:34,499
your core values.

401
00:26:36,196 --> 00:26:37,850
I've made choices, Father,

402
00:26:38,406 --> 00:26:41,492
terrible choices,
with people's lives on the line.

403
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:47,563
- You mean when you were at war?
- I'm not talking about the past.

404
00:26:50,645 --> 00:26:53,175
If this is an issue of law,

405
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:58,113
then perhaps you need to make
a confession of a different type?

406
00:27:08,454 --> 00:27:11,264
- It's Ryan. We wiped the footage.
- Good.

407
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:17,760
- Any luck?
- Yes, actually.

408
00:27:18,322 --> 00:27:21,097
They got to the security facility and
wiped the footage from after the attack.

409
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,355
- Damn it.
- They seem like pros,

410
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,769
so I figured
they'd scouted the route earlier.

411
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,981
I grabbed the footage from this morning.
It archives to a different server.

412
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,775
We reviewed it there.

413
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:31,877
Nice.

414
00:27:32,481 --> 00:27:33,631
Any suspects?

415
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,542
One name rang the cherries.

416
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:39,666
Not exactly your typical terrorist.

417
00:27:55,186 --> 00:27:57,377
These were taken this morning
near the crime scene.

418
00:27:57,506 --> 00:27:59,510
Your tire tracks, too.
You want to explain that?

419
00:28:01,273 --> 00:28:02,383
Come on, Father.

420
00:28:02,508 --> 00:28:05,099
Give me your cover story.
I'm sure you thought that through.

421
00:28:05,224 --> 00:28:06,479
I thought nothing through.

422
00:28:12,803 --> 00:28:15,333
I've sat across from a lot
of suspects in that chair.

423
00:28:16,373 --> 00:28:19,613
Some of them were remorseless,
sure, but not you.

424
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,326
I can read the guilt in your eyes.

425
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:29,290
I'm giving you a chance
to unburden yourself.

426
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,759
Answer him!
Do you think this is a game?

427
00:28:44,675 --> 00:28:47,683
Would you mind bringing Malik in here
with those crime scene photos?

428
00:28:47,997 --> 00:28:48,997
Please.

429
00:28:57,687 --> 00:28:59,959
The Vs loaded that shuttle
with dead bodies.

430
00:29:00,084 --> 00:29:02,969
They set us up. We didn't kill anyone.
Look really scared.

431
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:06,646
We can hold you for 48 hours
without charging you.

432
00:29:06,771 --> 00:29:08,954
Do you think your collar
will protect you in there?

433
00:29:17,092 --> 00:29:18,242
Explain this.

434
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,636
Those tires aren't unique to my van.

435
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,848
The church bought a whole fleet.
There must be...

436
00:29:28,593 --> 00:29:30,476
thousands of vehicles
with that tread.

437
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,812
Why were you at the tollbooth?

438
00:29:34,395 --> 00:29:37,400
It's a state parkway.
I was going to see a parishioner.

439
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:40,403
I'm sure he'll be happy
to confirm your story.

440
00:29:42,132 --> 00:29:44,281
I was consulting her
on matters of adultery.

441
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,928
Her name's confidential.

442
00:29:48,628 --> 00:29:50,888
- How convenient.
- Not to her husband.

443
00:29:53,477 --> 00:29:56,627
Tell me you didn't drag me away
because of a common tire impression

444
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,046
and a picture of me
traveling on a public parkway.

445
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,465
Because I can't imagine
you'd be wasting your time

446
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,260
harassing a priest during
an investigation this high-profile.

447
00:30:08,914 --> 00:30:10,574
So you better charge me

448
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:12,393
or let me go.

449
00:30:20,498 --> 00:30:21,807
Cut him loose.

450
00:30:48,858 --> 00:30:51,378
<i>And there were
glowing arrows on the ceiling.</i>

451
00:30:53,817 --> 00:30:57,042
<i>I was being taken by doctors,
down a dark corridor,</i>

452
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,885
<i>here on the ship.</i>

453
00:31:09,296 --> 00:31:10,502
<i>I was scared,</i>

454
00:31:10,804 --> 00:31:12,730
<i>but I couldn't tell them to stop.</i>

455
00:31:24,103 --> 00:31:25,716
<i>Hundreds of them...</i>

456
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,718
<i>and they poked into me...</i>

457
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,431
<i>all over.</i>

458
00:31:50,025 --> 00:31:51,770
<i>I know it was just a dream,</i>

459
00:31:52,096 --> 00:31:53,726
<i>but I can't shake it.</i>

460
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:04,797
I'm glad you came by
to bring me to the ship.

461
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,717
That's not why I stopped by.

462
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,795
I don't want you to move
onto the ship with me.

463
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:14,831
What?

464
00:32:15,587 --> 00:32:16,304
Why?

465
00:32:18,361 --> 00:32:20,499
You're a nice guy,

466
00:32:20,624 --> 00:32:24,624
but I don't have the same
feelings for you as you do for me.

467
00:32:25,107 --> 00:32:26,793
What are you talking about?

468
00:32:27,481 --> 00:32:29,724
You've been just as into this
as I have.

469
00:32:30,374 --> 00:32:32,422
My mother really likes you, Tyler.

470
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:35,518
I didn't want to disappoint her.

471
00:32:38,025 --> 00:32:39,927
So what about us on the shuttle?

472
00:32:40,921 --> 00:32:42,081
What was that?

473
00:32:45,127 --> 00:32:47,506
I just wanted
to see what it felt like.

474
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,111
That's all.

475
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,537
You can go.

476
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:03,938
We value life above all else,

477
00:33:05,746 --> 00:33:07,758
every single life.

478
00:33:08,683 --> 00:33:10,446
I wish we could have done something

479
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:13,476
to save the lives
that were tragically taken today

480
00:33:13,973 --> 00:33:15,868
by this unprovoked attack.

481
00:33:17,555 --> 00:33:20,817
<i>Perhaps our greatest flaw
is that we are too trusting.</i>

482
00:33:21,998 --> 00:33:24,752
<i>There are those that don't share
our regard for life.</i>

483
00:33:25,597 --> 00:33:27,951
<i>The 5th Column seeks to destroy us</i>

484
00:33:28,472 --> 00:33:30,462
<i>because we're from another place,</i>

485
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,832
<i>because they think
we don't belong here,</i>

486
00:33:35,899 --> 00:33:37,456
<i>because we're different.</i>

487
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,600
Get up to the ship.

488
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:43,921
Make sure it gets conveyed to Anna
the FBI is doing everything we can.

489
00:33:45,096 --> 00:33:48,001
Since our presence here
is causing such strife

490
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:50,728
that humans have been
caught in the crossfire,

491
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,698
we've been forced to
reconsider being here at all.

492
00:33:57,274 --> 00:34:00,287
I don't think I could bear
another tragedy like this.

493
00:34:04,114 --> 00:34:05,460
We are of peace.

494
00:34:06,694 --> 00:34:09,646
We are always of peace.

495
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,200
Kendrick needs to talk to you about
your involvement with 5th Column.

496
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,661
He wants you in the war room... now.

497
00:35:06,864 --> 00:35:10,746
I'm not going to let anything or
anyone else harm the Visitors, period.

498
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,757
I have orders to form
a task force to zero in on 5th Column.

499
00:35:18,569 --> 00:35:19,480
Evans...

500
00:35:21,173 --> 00:35:22,956
I'm assigning you to head it up.

501
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,036
You'll have every means
at your disposal,

502
00:35:26,161 --> 00:35:28,262
the full resources of this office,

503
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,850
and you'll be partnered
with Agent Malik.

504
00:35:35,576 --> 00:35:37,382
Agent Malik from the FBI.

505
00:35:37,507 --> 00:35:40,108
I'm here to see Marcus
about the shuttle crash.

506
00:35:53,242 --> 00:35:55,235
It is an honor to see you again,
my queen.

507
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:01,492
Only two of the crime
scene photos were damning.

508
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:04,455
I deleted them,
and destroyed the evidence

509
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,289
before anything could be forwarded
to the forensic anthropologist.

510
00:36:18,714 --> 00:36:22,077
Malik, cover the office, I'm rolling out
to grab that tollbooth footage.

511
00:36:22,202 --> 00:36:23,071
On it.

512
00:36:26,312 --> 00:36:27,890
You've done superb work,

513
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,750
under great pressure.

514
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,681
Permitting that missile
to strike the shuttle

515
00:36:32,806 --> 00:36:34,938
accomplish precisely
what you had hoped.

516
00:36:35,658 --> 00:36:37,528
The task force has been formed.

517
00:36:38,576 --> 00:36:40,781
I am now free to serve our people

518
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,099
and hunt down 5th column
with the full weight

519
00:36:43,224 --> 00:36:45,327
of the United States government
behind me.

520
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,862
<i>We have seen a massive amount</i>

521
00:36:51,987 --> 00:36:54,434
<i>of unprecedented sympathy for the Vs</i>

522
00:36:54,942 --> 00:36:57,957
<i>and an international outcry
against the 5th Column</i>

523
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,744
<i>and this atrocity carried
out at their hands.</i>

524
00:37:01,092 --> 00:37:03,177
<i>At this time,
there is very little...</i>

525
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:06,386
Now you're a prime suspect
in the bombing,

526
00:37:06,511 --> 00:37:09,212
it's gonna be even more dangerous
for us to be seen with you.

527
00:37:09,942 --> 00:37:11,105
We did this.

528
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,355
So you'd better have my back.

529
00:37:13,615 --> 00:37:15,757
We're in this together,
like it or not.

530
00:37:17,394 --> 00:37:18,179
Jack.

531
00:37:27,176 --> 00:37:29,538
He rides the private V shuttles,
so I warned him.

532
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:32,563
Chad Decker?

533
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,002
He asked Anna about it,
and that's how she found out.

534
00:37:35,972 --> 00:37:38,672
He's a potential ally. He doesn't know
anything. I've been careful.

535
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,841
I told you, you can't trust anyone.

536
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,676
He could have died.

537
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:45,095
So, you brought
all this down on our heads

538
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,181
'cause you didn't want
to risk that guy's life? One life?

539
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,350
I won't ever forget
what one life is worth.

540
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,104
If we're gonna win this war,
we can't go off the rails.

541
00:37:54,759 --> 00:37:56,857
We can't lose sight of who we are.

542
00:37:57,262 --> 00:37:58,387
Jack's right.

543
00:37:58,837 --> 00:38:00,485
We can never be like them.

544
00:38:01,961 --> 00:38:03,475
See, that's what Anna does.

545
00:38:04,426 --> 00:38:05,930
She takes our emotions,

546
00:38:06,357 --> 00:38:07,659
uses it against us,

547
00:38:08,123 --> 00:38:09,536
can't let her do that.

548
00:38:10,765 --> 00:38:13,143
You know, you can call yourselves
freedom fighters,

549
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:15,524
you can call yourself rebels,

550
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,186
but no make no mistake, kids...

551
00:38:18,692 --> 00:38:20,255
we're terrorists now.

552
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:24,551
Are you willing to bear that cross
so that people can sleep well at night?

553
00:38:24,807 --> 00:38:25,567
Yeah.

554
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,762
Why?

555
00:38:27,456 --> 00:38:29,223
We're the only ones willing to.

556
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,102
Hey, padre.

557
00:38:35,252 --> 00:38:36,633
Welcome back.

558
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:48,596
I'm sorry.

559
00:38:49,886 --> 00:38:53,510
I'm sorry about
going behind your back, mom.

560
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,293
What's the matter?

561
00:38:59,642 --> 00:39:00,805
You were right.

562
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,172
About everything.

563
00:39:03,137 --> 00:39:03,956
Lisa?

564
00:39:06,771 --> 00:39:08,728
She didn't care about me, mom.

565
00:39:09,437 --> 00:39:11,965
She just was using me.

566
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,444
Did she say that?

567
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:16,103
Okay.

568
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,022
How could I have been this stupid?

569
00:39:19,286 --> 00:39:21,024
Why am I that much of an idiot?

570
00:39:21,765 --> 00:39:24,021
No.
Oh, sweetie, of course not.

571
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,366
You just cared about someone.

572
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:27,796
Somebody that...

573
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:30,353
wasn't worth it.

574
00:39:33,892 --> 00:39:36,682
You never know why
anyone does what they do.

575
00:39:38,145 --> 00:39:38,891
Okay?

576
00:39:40,193 --> 00:39:41,812
World leaders have been calling,

577
00:39:41,937 --> 00:39:43,479
offering their condolences,

578
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:46,539
vowing to help in our fight
against 5th Column.

579
00:39:47,206 --> 00:39:49,184
They're concerned we might leave.

580
00:39:49,552 --> 00:39:50,320
Good.

581
00:39:51,518 --> 00:39:53,478
We'll use their fear
to our advantage,

582
00:39:53,603 --> 00:39:55,586
just as we did the Americans' today.

583
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:09,345
I'm sorry, mother.

584
00:40:10,304 --> 00:40:11,265
I failed.

585
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:16,038
Tyler won't be coming
to "Live Aboard."

586
00:40:17,311 --> 00:40:20,386
I pushed too hard, and he
doesn't want to see me anymore.

587
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,751
I did everything I could,

588
00:40:24,016 --> 00:40:26,965
but I believe the pull of his
mother was too strong for him.

589
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,842
I understand.

590
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,096
We'll have to find
a greater incentive for him.

591
00:40:49,876 --> 00:40:51,782
You were injured
in a 5th Column attack.

592
00:40:55,323 --> 00:40:56,870
Don't worry, daughter.

593
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:58,636
We'll get him back.

594
00:40:59,388 --> 00:41:03,392
There is no greater incentive for a
human male than a damsel in distress.

595
00:41:06,439 --> 00:41:07,464
Break her legs.

596
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:19,056
