1
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,343
Tyler?

2
00:00:45,028 --> 00:00:46,088
Did you feel that?

3
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,228
Tyler!

4
00:00:54,905 --> 00:00:55,532
Yeah, Mom?

5
00:00:55,713 --> 00:00:58,104
Yeah, you're in big trouble.
No, huge.

6
00:00:58,105 --> 00:00:59,822
- <i>I'm not kidding.</i>
- Yeah, I know.

7
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:16,486
Good morning, Roy.

8
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,216
Morning, Father Jack.

9
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:24,532
<i>Foreclosures
are on the rise,</i>

10
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:27,210
<i>up another 6%
in the last month alone.</i>

11
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:29,427
<i>And housing prices
continue to fall...</i>

12
00:01:29,627 --> 00:01:30,301
<i>Even as the latest</i>

13
00:01:30,336 --> 00:01:31,997
<i>economic stimulus package...</i>

14
00:01:35,612 --> 00:01:38,054
- Thanks for coming in so early.
- Oh, it's a pleasure.

15
00:01:38,756 --> 00:01:39,994
It's the only time
I could make it down here.

16
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:42,129
Ah, don't even mention it.

17
00:01:42,653 --> 00:01:44,758
All right. I'm a little excited.
You got the ring?

18
00:01:44,889 --> 00:01:46,902
Oh, of course
I got the ring.

19
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:04,809
She is gonna like this,
isn't she?

20
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,234
She's gonna love it.

21
00:02:07,554 --> 00:02:08,329
You know, I was gonna do

22
00:02:08,364 --> 00:02:09,854
the whole
"get down on one knee" thing.

23
00:02:09,894 --> 00:02:11,501
That's not too corny, is it?

24
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:15,051
Knee's a classic.
Can't go wrong with the knee.

25
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,436
- Knee it is.
- Good.

26
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,665
- What was that?
- I don't know.

27
00:02:26,206 --> 00:02:27,119
Morning, Haley.

28
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:29,042
Hey!
Good morning.

29
00:02:29,353 --> 00:02:30,370
- Here.
- Thank you.

30
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:33,216
You pitch Freddie
my idea?

31
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,550
He loved it,

32
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:36,636
thought it was a great take
on the vice president.

33
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:38,965
And let me guess--
he wants Martinez to do it.

34
00:02:39,545 --> 00:02:41,112
They love you and all...

35
00:02:41,192 --> 00:02:43,762
Hey, it's cool.
I get it.

36
00:02:44,853 --> 00:02:47,681
Shut up, Chad,
and read the news.

37
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,184
How exactly
did you get into a fight?

38
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:57,251
Crashing a party
in Soho.

39
00:02:57,394 --> 00:02:59,602
So you snuck out in the middle
of the night to go to a party?

40
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:01,499
Well, it was Brandon's
dumb-ass idea.

41
00:03:02,064 --> 00:03:02,973
Who's a dumb-ass?

42
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:03,965
Where are you?

43
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:06,024
<i>Some clinic off
of Bloomfield.</i>

44
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:08,467
I'm coming to get you.

45
00:03:08,572 --> 00:03:10,585
Yeah, I-I'll just
take my bike home. It's...

46
00:03:12,713 --> 00:03:13,649
What's going on?!

47
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:17,747
What is this?!

48
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:19,915
- Tyler!
- <i>Mom, what is this?!</i>

49
00:03:37,225 --> 00:03:37,800
Roy!

50
00:03:55,052 --> 00:03:56,520
Look out!
It's coming down!

51
00:04:34,057 --> 00:04:35,872
Mom? Mom?!

52
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:38,018
Tyler?
Stay where you are.

53
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:39,283
<i>Tyler, are you somewhere safe?</i>

54
00:04:39,318 --> 00:04:39,805
Mom?

55
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,734
- <i>Mom! Mom!</i>
- Tyler?

56
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:43,628
Tyler! Stay where you are!

57
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:45,303
- I'm coming for you! Tyler!
- Mom?

58
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,706
Something's wrong, man.
I gotta go.

59
00:04:49,685 --> 00:04:50,788
I'm not going anywhere.

60
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:55,772
Oh, my God!

61
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:40,622
Idiot!

62
00:05:57,078 --> 00:05:57,840
Hey!

63
00:05:57,908 --> 00:05:59,842
Let's go, kid!
Let's move it! Come on!

64
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:00,877
It's the only way
I can get home!

65
00:06:01,065 --> 00:06:02,451
- Let's move!
- I mean, all the streets

66
00:06:02,486 --> 00:06:04,784
- are blocked, man!
- This area is restricted, kid! Move!

67
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:06,322
But w--I mean,
what about my bike?!

68
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:08,653
No more! Let's go!
Move out, people! Move, move!

69
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:09,969
- Let's go! Let's go!
- What is that?

70
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:12,196
<i>Since their arrival,
there's been no contact</i>

71
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:13,887
<i>with any
of the 29 ships,</i>

72
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,135
<i>now hovering over
the major cities of the world.</i>

73
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,682
Come on, Ryan,
pick up.

74
00:06:18,032 --> 00:06:19,973
<i>Streets are jammed.
People are trying to flee--</i>

75
00:06:20,697 --> 00:06:22,664
<i>The sheer mass of the ships
moving through</i>

76
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:25,114
<i>New York and L.A. was enough
to rock both cities for miles--</i>

77
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:27,190
<i>And N.O.R.A.D.
is now confirming</i>

78
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,123
<i>the first jet
to encounter the spacecrafts</i>

79
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,737
<i>experienced
full electrical failure.</i>

80
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:34,109
<i>Dude, this is
"Independence Day"!</i>

81
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,388
<i>Which was a rip-off</i>

82
00:06:35,423 --> 00:06:37,660
<i>of any number of
alien invasion predecessors.</i>

83
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:39,774
Oh, thank God!

84
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:42,794
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

85
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:43,733
Good.

86
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,170
Oh, thank God!

87
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,808
- I need to get through.
- <i>Nobody</i> is getting through.

88
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:49,882
Look again, Sergeant.

89
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:51,585
- I'm FBI.
- Counterterrorism division. I can read.

90
00:06:51,586 --> 00:06:53,585
- You're still not getting past.
- I'm looking for my son.

91
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,203
Everybody is looking

92
00:06:54,262 --> 00:06:55,450
- for their son right now.
- My son is in there.

93
00:06:55,485 --> 00:06:56,937
If you will let me in there,
I can find him.

94
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:58,164
I'm not gonna
tell you again.

95
00:06:58,226 --> 00:06:59,611
Turn around.
Nobody is getting through.

96
00:06:59,683 --> 00:07:01,677
- Turn around.
- Please! He called me an hour ago.

97
00:07:01,678 --> 00:07:02,544
He's in there!

98
00:07:02,897 --> 00:07:04,794
Hey! Hey! Hey!

99
00:07:12,082 --> 00:07:14,049
Come on, now!

100
00:07:16,086 --> 00:07:16,945
Tyler?

101
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:19,412
Ty?

102
00:07:19,756 --> 00:07:20,559
Mom?

103
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:21,466
Tyler!

104
00:07:23,002 --> 00:07:24,990
- Mom! Oh.
- Oh!

105
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,785
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

106
00:07:42,746 --> 00:07:45,542
Oh, God! Oh, God!

107
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,817
Oh, my God.

108
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:14,516
Yeah.

109
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,093
"Pilot"

110
00:08:25,856 --> 00:08:27,056
<i>Don't be frightened.</i>

111
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:29,051
<i>We mean no harm.</i>

112
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:31,743
<i>Please accept
our apologies.</i>

113
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:33,397
<i>We're truly anguished</i>

114
00:08:33,432 --> 00:08:35,474
<i>by the turmoil
our arrival has caused.</i>

115
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,584
<i>This is
a momentous day.</i>

116
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:39,670
<i>Until now,</i>

117
00:08:39,731 --> 00:08:41,863
<i>we believed we were
the only intelligent life</i>

118
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:42,938
<i>in the Universe.</i>

119
00:08:43,742 --> 00:08:46,338
<i>We're overjoyed to find
that we're not alone.</i>

120
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,469
<i>My name is Anna, and I am
the leader of my people.</i>

121
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:53,878
<i>We're delighted
to meet you,</i>

122
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,967
<i>but we need your help.</i>

123
00:08:57,463 --> 00:08:58,747
<i>We're far from home...</i>

124
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,012
<i>After we've
replenished ourselves</i>

125
00:09:22,047 --> 00:09:23,499
<i>and shared with you
what we can,</i>

126
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:25,245
<i>we will leave you,</i>

127
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:27,162
<i>hopefully better
than we found you.</i>

128
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:30,586
<i>We look forward to getting
to know our new friends.</i>

129
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:32,422
<i>There will be
more communication</i>

130
00:09:32,457 --> 00:09:34,619
<i>with your world's leaders
in the hours to come.</i>

131
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:36,279
<i>Until then,</i>

132
00:09:37,227 --> 00:09:40,296
<i>we are of peace
always.</i>

133
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,905
<i>"We're all God's creatures"?</i>

134
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:11,426
That's how the Vatican explains
the existence of aliens?

135
00:10:11,494 --> 00:10:12,091
Yes.

136
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:14,596
- They decided that in a day?
- Yes.

137
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,929
Rattlesnakes
are God's creatures, too.

138
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:18,002
Doesn't mean
they're good for us.

139
00:10:18,045 --> 00:10:20,667
- Have faith in our leaders, Jack.
- I do, Father.

140
00:10:20,737 --> 00:10:23,064
It's just that there's not a lot
of scripture on the subject.

141
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:24,158
Meaning?

142
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:26,815
I'm at a loss to explain

143
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,610
how God and aliens
exist in the same world.

144
00:10:28,678 --> 00:10:29,258
Aren't you?

145
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,421
What do you want
to do, Jack?

146
00:10:30,482 --> 00:10:32,449
Call the Vatican and
question their position?

147
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,256
No, I just...

148
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:35,492
I don't know what to do.

149
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:36,696
All we <i>can</i> do is

150
00:10:36,777 --> 00:10:38,743
pray and minster
to our congregation.

151
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,343
Our congregation
amounts to two bag ladies,

152
00:10:41,378 --> 00:10:43,226
a heroin addict
and Roy.

153
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:44,290
That may be, Father Landry,

154
00:10:44,325 --> 00:10:47,653
but we will minister
to any size... congregation.

155
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:02,457
<i>And it appears</i>

156
00:11:02,497 --> 00:11:04,164
- <i>there's some kind of translation...</i>
- Look at that.

157
00:11:04,226 --> 00:11:04,980
It--It's opening up.

158
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,717
Oh! Dude--Dude,
that is so cool!

159
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,673
I was right there, man.

160
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:08,778
I was right
underneath that thing.

161
00:11:08,818 --> 00:11:10,061
Ohh! Why didn't
I come with you, man?

162
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:12,038
They're calling themselves
"the Visitors."

163
00:11:12,073 --> 00:11:13,483
<i>You say that
like it bothers you.</i>

164
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:16,127
Visitors are old friends
who drop by for a drink.

165
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,402
Did you see that we got
a COMSAT alert today?

166
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,946
Uh, no, I was a little busy

167
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,813
looking at the spaceships
outside my window.

168
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:24,569
<i>You're looking
at terrorist alerts?</i>

169
00:11:24,604 --> 00:11:26,505
The chatter among
terrorist cells worldwide

170
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,332
dropped like a rock
when the V's showed up.

171
00:11:28,374 --> 00:11:30,704
Except for one of the cells
we've been tracking.

172
00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:33,697
Their chatter--instead of
falling off, it actually spiked.

173
00:11:33,732 --> 00:11:34,926
<i>So what, you think
there's a connection</i>

174
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:35,771
between the two?

175
00:11:35,806 --> 00:11:37,892
<i>We intercepted an uncoded
message from them.</i>

176
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:38,925
<i>As of yesterday,</i>

177
00:11:39,015 --> 00:11:41,856
they're suddenly looking to
acquire large amounts of C-4.

178
00:11:42,358 --> 00:11:44,938
Why do that unless
you're going after a target?

179
00:11:44,973 --> 00:11:46,075
Like say us,

180
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,224
<i>while we're distracted?</i>

181
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,426
I'll run the databases. I'll put
together a profile on them.

182
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:52,782
Thank you.
You watching?

183
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:54,746
Yeah, I'm watching.

184
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:57,014
<i>Anna and her entourage</i>

185
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,428
<i>will be escorted
into the building where she...</i>

186
00:11:59,463 --> 00:12:01,615
Hey, how are you with all of this?
Are you and Tyler okay?

187
00:12:02,393 --> 00:12:03,281
We're fine.

188
00:12:03,863 --> 00:12:05,029
Did you hear
from the ex?

189
00:12:05,844 --> 00:12:08,406
He, uh, he left a message.

190
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:12,389
He wanted us to know
<i>he's</i> okay. Um.

191
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:15,405
<i>I'm not bitter. It's fine.
I feel good, happy.</i>

192
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,951
Hey, you know that
I'm here for you,

193
00:12:17,986 --> 00:12:18,924
<i>anything you need.</i>

194
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,607
<i>Look, we'll hit the ground
running tomorrow.</i>

195
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:22,363
Go be a mom.

196
00:12:22,881 --> 00:12:23,675
You rock.

197
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,949
<i>These are live pictures</i>

198
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:27,254
<i>coming to you from the lobby
of the United Nations...</i>

199
00:12:27,303 --> 00:12:29,356
- Hey, Mom, it's starting.
- Yeah.

200
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:30,370
<i>Here--here is Anna.</i>

201
00:12:30,732 --> 00:12:32,912
<i>She is now approaching
the mike for a statement.</i>

202
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:35,189
- <i>Let's listen in.</i>
- <i>Anna, please! Anna!</i>

203
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,924
- Damn, she's hot.
- I know, right?!

204
00:12:39,544 --> 00:12:40,713
Right here, guys.

205
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,242
<i>This is
an inspiring moment</i>

206
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:45,254
for us all--

207
00:12:46,116 --> 00:12:48,600
Mankind and visitors coming together.

208
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:51,889
We are honored
by your friendship.

209
00:12:52,507 --> 00:12:54,209
We will cherish it,

210
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:55,649
nurture it,

211
00:12:56,732 --> 00:12:58,191
and never abandon it.

212
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:01,662
<i>We are
of peace always.</i>

213
00:13:02,598 --> 00:13:03,515
<i>Anna! Anna!</i>

214
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:09,488
Anna,
how long have you been...

215
00:13:09,838 --> 00:13:11,081
Anna, what do
you have to say

216
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:12,518
about the damage caused
by your arrival?

217
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:14,669
Explain the similarities
between visitors and humans.

218
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,135
Our scientists say
it's impossible.

219
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:17,700
<i>Our</i> scientists
can explain it.

220
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,388
That's not an answer.
Why don't <i>you</i> explain it?

221
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,988
Hey, why don't you
show some respect?

222
00:13:21,182 --> 00:13:22,720
Ooh!

223
00:13:24,742 --> 00:13:26,252
<i>Do you have a question?</i>

224
00:13:27,177 --> 00:13:28,494
Yeah. I have a question.

225
00:13:28,845 --> 00:13:31,336
Is there such a thing
as an ugly visitor?

226
00:13:33,655 --> 00:13:34,612
I don't understand.

227
00:13:34,951 --> 00:13:37,697
Oh, you all seem to be
what we consider attractive.

228
00:13:39,082 --> 00:13:39,794
Thank you.

229
00:13:40,546 --> 00:13:41,991
You're not
so bad yourself.

230
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,126
No, I'm sorry.
No one allowed past this point.

231
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,549
Come back here! Anna!

232
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:56,393
It was a truly
remarkable moment.

233
00:13:56,676 --> 00:13:58,587
In the midst of all the chaos
and, yes,

234
00:13:58,622 --> 00:14:01,536
even hostility from some,
came something unexpected

235
00:14:01,571 --> 00:14:03,842
from our new friends--
a sense of humor.

236
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,577
<i>Should the press
be so tough on the V's?</i>

237
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,313
<i>They did just get here,
after all.</i>

238
00:14:08,768 --> 00:14:09,577
<i>When we come back,</i>

239
00:14:09,612 --> 00:14:11,389
<i>I'll be joined by a panel
of media experts</i>

240
00:14:11,424 --> 00:14:13,206
<i>to discuss that
and much, much more.</i>

241
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:14,540
<i>Stay with us.
We'll be right back.</i>

242
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:18,442
I want him.

243
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,476
<i>It's been three weeks
since the Visitors' arrival</i>

244
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:38,227
yet thousands
are still flocking

245
00:14:38,262 --> 00:14:39,845
to see the mother ships
in person.

246
00:14:40,201 --> 00:14:43,517
<i>As a result, host cities
find themselves in the midst</i>

247
00:14:43,552 --> 00:14:45,122
<i>of a mini-economic boom--</i>

248
00:14:45,383 --> 00:14:48,021
<i>Tourism, spending
on V merchandise--</i>

249
00:14:48,056 --> 00:14:50,928
<i>All a welcome shot in the arm
to local economies.</i>

250
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,844
<i>The newly opened
visitor healing centers</i>

251
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,313
<i>are drawing huge crowds.</i>

252
00:14:55,793 --> 00:14:56,638
<i>People afflicted</i>

253
00:14:56,673 --> 00:14:59,408
<i>with one of the 65 ailments
the V's can cure</i>

254
00:14:59,443 --> 00:15:02,650
<i>are jamming the centers, hoping
for their own personal miracle.</i>

255
00:15:03,049 --> 00:15:05,328
<i>And government officials
have begun talks</i>

256
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,994
<i>to open
Visitor embassies.</i>

257
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,821
<i>But not everyone
likes the idea.</i>

258
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,608
<i>Violent protests
denouncing the V's</i>

259
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:13,975
<i>have broken out
in numerous host cities.</i>

260
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:16,875
<i>And more demonstrations are
planned in the days to come.</i>

261
00:15:17,336 --> 00:15:18,271
<i>More on this...</i>

262
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:20,421
We finally got
a real lead on our cell.

263
00:15:21,032 --> 00:15:21,761
Our cell?

264
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,789
- I've heard that one before.
- No, this is a good one.

265
00:15:25,111 --> 00:15:26,313
That's my coffee.

266
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,562
A truck suspected
of hauling drugs

267
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:31,384
was impounded by N.Y.P.D.
last night.

268
00:15:31,977 --> 00:15:34,357
They searched for residue--
no drugs.

269
00:15:34,664 --> 00:15:36,891
But they <i>did</i> find
traces of...

270
00:15:37,535 --> 00:15:38,458
C-4.

271
00:15:38,526 --> 00:15:40,406
Uh-huh. See this?

272
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:42,230
The truck came from here
on Long Island.

273
00:15:42,265 --> 00:15:43,973
- Nice!
- Field trip?

274
00:15:44,837 --> 00:15:45,702
Can I drive?

275
00:15:45,974 --> 00:15:46,575
No.

276
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:52,081
- Copy that.
- Silos are empty.

277
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:53,873
We're still searching
the grounds,

278
00:15:53,941 --> 00:15:56,874
but I gotta tell you, E.,
this feels like another dead end.

279
00:15:56,909 --> 00:15:57,870
- Yeah.
- What's this,

280
00:15:57,909 --> 00:15:59,427
20 leads we found
on this cell so far?

281
00:15:59,462 --> 00:16:01,270
- Every one of them's fallen through.
- Uh-huh.

282
00:16:02,184 --> 00:16:02,817
What?

283
00:16:04,609 --> 00:16:05,807
Look at the sat photo.

284
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,048
- Yeah?
- That's our truck.

285
00:16:08,923 --> 00:16:11,312
What is a white truck doing
parked in front of that shack?

286
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,063
Nothin'.

287
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,309
I think we can
rule out suicide.

288
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:35,000
C-4.

289
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,073
Yeah, this is Ryan.

290
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,198
I need your help.

291
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:48,628
How'd you get
this number?

292
00:17:48,663 --> 00:17:50,605
They're here.
It's starting.

293
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,908
I'm not that guy anymore.
Don't call me again.

294
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,892
Hey.

295
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:02,436
- Ready for lunch?
- Hey. Oh, yeah.

296
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:03,745
I'm hungry.

297
00:18:06,738 --> 00:18:08,079
What if
that was important?

298
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,708
Sweetheart, there is nothing
more important than you.

299
00:18:22,993 --> 00:18:24,106
How'd you get tickets?

300
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,110
Dude, I can't believe
we're about to see

301
00:18:26,145 --> 00:18:27,806
the inside
of a freakin' spaceship.

302
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:28,892
You rock.

303
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:30,894
Holy!
This is awesome.

304
00:18:30,962 --> 00:18:33,100
Dude!
This is incredible, man!

305
00:18:33,502 --> 00:18:35,700
- It's like an amusement park.
- <i>...To the main docking station</i>

306
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:37,439
Will only take
about two minutes,

307
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:40,009
so hang on tight
and enjoy the ride.

308
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,886
Wow.

309
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:11,134
Unbelievable, man.

310
00:19:40,898 --> 00:19:42,176
Step this way, please,

311
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:44,171
and welcome.

312
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:08,553
Hello.

313
00:20:11,162 --> 00:20:12,795
Welcome to
the New York mother ship.

314
00:20:13,097 --> 00:20:14,413
My name is Lisa.

315
00:20:27,178 --> 00:20:29,651
The examiner says the body's
been dead less than a day,

316
00:20:29,652 --> 00:20:31,388
but he was tortured
before he was killed.

317
00:20:31,642 --> 00:20:34,600
They've been printing
fake docs--passports, I.D.s.

318
00:20:34,953 --> 00:20:36,478
Best fakes
I've ever seen.

319
00:20:37,255 --> 00:20:39,843
It's a major operation,
but no one was here.

320
00:20:40,224 --> 00:20:42,181
They cleared out
like they knew we were coming.

321
00:20:43,027 --> 00:20:44,809
We'll get the prints
off the victim,

322
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:46,309
see if we can get his I.D.

323
00:20:54,972 --> 00:20:57,040
Our ability
to manipulate gravity

324
00:20:57,108 --> 00:20:59,604
is essential
for long-term space travel.

325
00:21:00,758 --> 00:21:01,903
Dude, dude,
check it out.

326
00:21:17,228 --> 00:21:19,336
Oh, dude. That V girl's
coming over here.

327
00:21:19,371 --> 00:21:20,202
Be cool.

328
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:22,735
Having a good time?

329
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:23,944
Having a great time.

330
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:25,393
Good.

331
00:21:26,187 --> 00:21:28,225
Have you heard about our
new peace ambassador program?

332
00:21:28,473 --> 00:21:30,212
Peace ambassador program?

333
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,932
Yeah. You sign up,
hang out with V's,

334
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:34,147
learn about our culture,

335
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:36,706
and you act as V ambassadors
to your own communities.

336
00:21:37,118 --> 00:21:38,252
You even get a uniform.

337
00:21:38,383 --> 00:21:40,695
Ah, it sucks. You have to be
18 years old to join.

338
00:21:41,963 --> 00:21:43,186
We're only 17.

339
00:21:43,254 --> 00:21:45,753
You can still join. You just
need your parent's signature.

340
00:21:46,163 --> 00:21:49,746
Yeah. Well, that's, uh,
kind of a tough sell right now.

341
00:21:49,794 --> 00:21:51,473
Our parents don't even know
we're here.

342
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,451
It's too bad. I just got assigned
to the New York chapter.

343
00:21:56,995 --> 00:21:58,591
We could've spent
some time together.

344
00:22:12,817 --> 00:22:15,611
<i>We're all so quick
to jump on the bandwagon.</i>

345
00:22:16,821 --> 00:22:18,572
And a ride on
the bandwagon, it's...

346
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,547
It sounds like fun.

347
00:22:24,367 --> 00:22:25,844
<i>But before we get on,</i>

348
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:28,792
let us at least make sure
it is sturdy...

349
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:31,340
and sound.

350
00:22:33,638 --> 00:22:35,445
<i>Let us
at least examine it</i>

351
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,812
to <i>really</i> make sure

352
00:22:36,847 --> 00:22:39,048
it is something that we want
to climb aboard.

353
00:22:41,487 --> 00:22:44,195
No one is saying,
"Don't trust the Visitors."

354
00:22:46,053 --> 00:22:47,838
Don't they need to earn
our trust?

355
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,067
It's something we all need
to think about.

356
00:22:56,085 --> 00:22:58,172
<i>I thought we were clear
about this, Jack.</i>

357
00:22:58,207 --> 00:23:00,867
People need to hear the V's are
part of God's plan.

358
00:23:00,902 --> 00:23:01,955
They hear it from you,
Father.

359
00:23:01,985 --> 00:23:03,680
They need to hear it
from you, too.

360
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:07,854
I thank God for the Visitors
every day, Jack.

361
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:10,523
This church stood empty
for years. Now look at it.

362
00:23:10,675 --> 00:23:13,143
The Visitors are not
driving people away from God.

363
00:23:13,144 --> 00:23:14,767
They're driving people
<i>back</i> to God.

364
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:17,881
People are scared, Father.
That's why they come.

365
00:23:17,949 --> 00:23:20,555
But they come, and that's
the blessing in disguise.

366
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,987
It bothers me
that they showed up

367
00:23:22,057 --> 00:23:23,472
right when we needed them
the most.

368
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:25,281
The world's in bad shape,
Father.

369
00:23:25,351 --> 00:23:27,109
Who wouldn't welcome
a savior right now?

370
00:23:28,893 --> 00:23:32,770
I agree they're a godsend,
and we should be grateful.

371
00:23:33,081 --> 00:23:34,406
But that's the danger.

372
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:37,000
Under the right conditions
and with enough time,

373
00:23:37,068 --> 00:23:38,980
gratitude can morph
into worship...

374
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:42,523
Or worse--devotion.

375
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,603
Hey.

376
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,540
I thought you priest types
would like to see somethin'.

377
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:55,381
They healed me.

378
00:23:58,853 --> 00:24:00,322
I got no pain.

379
00:24:02,147 --> 00:24:03,221
My God, Roy.

380
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:05,115
It's amazing.

381
00:24:05,596 --> 00:24:06,479
Yeah.

382
00:24:10,735 --> 00:24:11,387
Ty.

383
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:13,151
Come here
for a second.

384
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:18,057
Your principal sent me
this link to this...

385
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:19,657
awesome video.

386
00:24:23,548 --> 00:24:25,049
What are you doing
on my account?

387
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,210
Check it out.

388
00:24:26,928 --> 00:24:28,319
<i>More, more, more!
Come on!</i>

389
00:24:28,354 --> 00:24:31,331
<i>V's rule! Come on! Hurry up.
There's gonna be people coming.</i>

390
00:24:31,883 --> 00:24:33,163
- <i>V's rule!</i>
- <i>V's rule, man!</i>

391
00:24:33,724 --> 00:24:36,684
First and foremost, the fact
that you're tagging now--

392
00:24:37,194 --> 00:24:38,671
<i>So</i> proud.

393
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:42,054
I called Brandon's folks to kind of,
you know, spread the joy.

394
00:24:42,421 --> 00:24:43,308
They weren't surprised.

395
00:24:43,343 --> 00:24:45,270
They said that you two
are obsessed with the V's.

396
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:47,511
I'm not obsessed.

397
00:24:47,581 --> 00:24:50,485
Really? Because this looks
very obsessive to me.

398
00:24:50,608 --> 00:24:52,317
Texts, instant messages.

399
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:53,743
And here's
an--an entire page

400
00:24:53,795 --> 00:24:55,365
about how to spread their word
through tagging.

401
00:24:55,445 --> 00:24:56,120
Those aren't even
my links.

402
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,687
Brandon sent them to me.

403
00:24:57,688 --> 00:25:00,668
Oh. Well, that's okay then.
Brandon sent them to you.

404
00:25:00,727 --> 00:25:03,386
So you're gonna do whatever
Brandon or--or the V's

405
00:25:03,454 --> 00:25:04,912
or who--whoever
tells you to do?

406
00:25:04,954 --> 00:25:07,370
- You have to think for yourself, Tyler.
- I <i>do</i> think for myself!

407
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,257
Tagging someone's property
because a web site tell you to

408
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:12,482
- is thinking for yourself?
- You call it tagging.

409
00:25:12,848 --> 00:25:15,336
But you know what? The V's--
They call it spreading hope.

410
00:25:20,215 --> 00:25:21,118
Okay.

411
00:25:21,706 --> 00:25:22,567
Okay.

412
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:25,285
You have to talk to me.

413
00:25:26,243 --> 00:25:27,147
Talk to me.

414
00:25:27,638 --> 00:25:29,676
You and me, we talk.
What's going on with you?

415
00:25:33,077 --> 00:25:34,197
Is it
because of your dad?

416
00:25:35,353 --> 00:25:36,327
Is it because he left?

417
00:25:38,456 --> 00:25:41,024
You're blaming <i>him?</i>

418
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:46,163
At least
he has an excuse

419
00:25:46,418 --> 00:25:48,134
to be out of touch
with his kid.

420
00:25:49,388 --> 00:25:50,666
<i>He</i> left <i>me.</i>

421
00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:52,929
<i>I</i> did not leave.

422
00:25:53,237 --> 00:25:54,743
<i>I</i> am here for you.

423
00:25:55,673 --> 00:25:57,763
Oh, <i>when</i> you're here.

424
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,835
There he is--
the man of the hour.

425
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,601
Hello, Mr. Decker.

426
00:26:21,293 --> 00:26:21,981
Hello.

427
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:25,353
- What's going on, Freddie?
- You've been selected.

428
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,403
For?

429
00:26:26,671 --> 00:26:29,123
Anna would like to do
a live broadcast from the ship,

430
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:32,671
and intimate one-on-one to help
ease the protests against us.

431
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,212
She'd like <i>you</i>
to do the interview.

432
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,318
I-I-I got it.

433
00:26:51,976 --> 00:26:52,906
Who was that?

434
00:26:54,345 --> 00:26:55,096
It's no one.

435
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,819
- No one?
- Yes. No one.

436
00:26:59,613 --> 00:27:03,223
You've been getting
a lot of calls from "no one."

437
00:27:03,988 --> 00:27:05,063
It's nothing.

438
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:06,429
Okay?

439
00:27:07,517 --> 00:27:09,213
We don't do this,
you and me--

440
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:10,379
Keep secrets.

441
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:12,559
Talk to me.

442
00:27:13,727 --> 00:27:15,087
What's going on?

443
00:27:16,771 --> 00:27:18,758
What's going on?
Sweetheart...

444
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,870
Just... don't read things
into things, okay?

445
00:27:22,006 --> 00:27:24,039
It was no one. Really.

446
00:27:25,502 --> 00:27:26,417
So pretty...

447
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,051
- I forgot my spoon.
- Yeah.

448
00:27:31,241 --> 00:27:32,756
Uh, can I get
an extra spoon?

449
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:35,959
Okay.
Thank you, sir.

450
00:27:37,273 --> 00:27:39,151
What do you know?
Another fake one.

451
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,042
Others like this.

452
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:42,576
Solve the case yet,
Sherlock?

453
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:44,811
Not one name,
not one photo,

454
00:27:44,812 --> 00:27:45,933
not anything
from these passports

455
00:27:45,983 --> 00:27:47,208
matches anyone
in our system.

456
00:27:47,571 --> 00:27:50,520
How can you not find this guy?
He's very creepy.

457
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,863
If only "creepy"
were a biometric parameter

458
00:27:52,898 --> 00:27:54,668
in our facial recognition
software.

459
00:27:54,987 --> 00:27:56,931
You're kind of sexy when
you talk all computer-y.

460
00:27:57,141 --> 00:27:58,487
- I am?
- Absolutely.

461
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,023
What's this?

462
00:28:00,507 --> 00:28:04,443
Progress. I I.D.ed
our victim from the silo.

463
00:28:04,478 --> 00:28:05,880
His name is
Owen Chapman.

464
00:28:05,881 --> 00:28:08,150
This is a search warrant
for his house.

465
00:28:08,152 --> 00:28:09,001
All right.

466
00:28:24,435 --> 00:28:25,272
Clear here!

467
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:26,166
Yeah, I'll check...

468
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,167
They knew
we were coming <i>again.</i>

469
00:28:28,168 --> 00:28:29,446
Someone tipped them off.

470
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,207
Who are you calling?

471
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:37,642
Owen.

472
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:39,429
Owen--our victim Owen?

473
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,162
Text.

474
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:52,100
"To: All attending tonight.

475
00:28:52,151 --> 00:28:56,590
"Location: 400 Pier Avenue,
Brooklyn, 10:00 P.M. Pass code.

476
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,770
"If you're new,
be prepared for the test.

477
00:28:58,805 --> 00:29:02,066
Any info you can share
about this cell is important."

478
00:29:02,961 --> 00:29:05,079
Owen was going to a meeting
about a sleeper cell?

479
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,013
If you have info
about a sleeper cell,

480
00:29:07,084 --> 00:29:09,494
you call the cops.
You don't go to a meeting.

481
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:22,424
Ryan.

482
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:24,457
Stay away from me,
Georgie.

483
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:25,343
Ryan, please.

484
00:29:25,393 --> 00:29:26,881
Look, I told you I'm not
that guy anymore, okay?

485
00:29:26,882 --> 00:29:28,536
- Stop calling me.
- We need your help.

486
00:29:28,842 --> 00:29:30,751
"We"?
Who's "we"?

487
00:29:31,173 --> 00:29:32,687
There's about 25 of us.

488
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,797
We've only met a couple times
but we're still recruiting.

489
00:29:34,877 --> 00:29:35,612
Again?

490
00:29:36,203 --> 00:29:36,885
You're trying that again

491
00:29:36,926 --> 00:29:38,214
after all those people
got killed the last time?

492
00:29:38,274 --> 00:29:40,060
We're being a lot more careful
this time.

493
00:29:40,061 --> 00:29:41,052
Please, you gotta help us.

494
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,668
Look, I'm about
to get engaged, okay?

495
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,497
I'm not gonna
put my fiancé at risk.

496
00:29:45,532 --> 00:29:47,360
If I get involved,
it puts her at risk,

497
00:29:47,646 --> 00:29:48,834
and I'm not gonna
let that happen.

498
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:50,548
So you're just gonna sit
there on the sidelines?

499
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,333
You know how many lives
are at stake?

500
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:56,350
She doesn't know
about my past, okay?

501
00:29:58,033 --> 00:29:59,519
I'd like to keep it
that way.

502
00:30:01,996 --> 00:30:04,418
That's where we're meeting
if you change your mind...

503
00:30:05,565 --> 00:30:07,614
Or grow a conscience.

504
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,653
I liked your sermon
the other day.

505
00:30:20,978 --> 00:30:22,502
You're right
to question the V's.

506
00:30:24,185 --> 00:30:25,259
Are you all right?

507
00:30:25,632 --> 00:30:27,362
I know the real reason
they're here, Father,

508
00:30:27,397 --> 00:30:29,427
and I am not
the only one.

509
00:30:30,753 --> 00:30:31,566
The real reason?

510
00:30:31,601 --> 00:30:33,809
The V's are
gonna obliterate us.

511
00:30:34,593 --> 00:30:35,382
You're bleeding!

512
00:30:36,382 --> 00:30:37,889
I was coming to see you.

513
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,491
- The V's did this to me.
- Let me get you some help.

514
00:30:39,526 --> 00:30:40,277
No, no, no, no.

515
00:30:40,696 --> 00:30:43,677
Take this
and go to this address

516
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:45,453
and give it
to the people there.

517
00:30:45,876 --> 00:30:47,572
All right,
all the information's inside.

518
00:30:48,717 --> 00:30:49,950
- Promise me.
- Okay.

519
00:30:50,302 --> 00:30:52,416
Please, it's important.

520
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:55,666
Okay. Okay, okay.
I'm gonna get you some help.

521
00:30:56,975 --> 00:30:57,641
I'll be right back.

522
00:31:21,027 --> 00:31:22,545
Thanks again for choosing me
to do this.

523
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,747
- I'm really excited.
- So are we.

524
00:31:25,465 --> 00:31:27,408
Do you have any questions
before we go to air?

525
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:30,341
No. Just be sure
not to ask anything

526
00:31:30,376 --> 00:31:31,806
that would paint us
in a negative light.

527
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:34,094
Excuse me?

528
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,182
Don't ask any questions that
would portray us negatively.

529
00:31:37,777 --> 00:31:39,579
Ask ones like you did
when we first met.

530
00:31:41,361 --> 00:31:42,797
Oh, I think
there's a mistake.

531
00:31:43,316 --> 00:31:44,701
I'm a journalist.

532
00:31:44,984 --> 00:31:46,885
It's my job
to ask questions

533
00:31:46,886 --> 00:31:49,522
even if they make
the other person uncomfortable.

534
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,025
That was not
my understanding.

535
00:31:52,026 --> 00:31:53,354
Standing by to go to air.

536
00:31:54,294 --> 00:31:55,740
Afraid I don't have
a choice.

537
00:31:57,864 --> 00:31:59,611
This interview
is now canceled.

538
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:02,088
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hang on. Hang on.

539
00:32:06,306 --> 00:32:07,955
Look, this is just
how it's done.

540
00:32:08,308 --> 00:32:10,011
I swear I'll be fair.

541
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,648
You'll need to be more than fair
if you want to proceed.

542
00:32:13,215 --> 00:32:14,401
Two minutes to air.

543
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,032
We can't be seen
in a negative light.

544
00:32:22,276 --> 00:32:24,190
This interview
would elevate your career,

545
00:32:24,225 --> 00:32:25,273
wouldn't it, Mr. Decker?

546
00:32:27,427 --> 00:32:29,311
Don't you want
to elevate your career?

547
00:32:43,685 --> 00:32:45,174
You don't even know
what this meeting is,

548
00:32:45,209 --> 00:32:46,830
and you're just gonna
go in like you're invited.

549
00:32:46,976 --> 00:32:49,117
They're expecting people they
haven't met before, so, yeah.

550
00:32:49,663 --> 00:32:52,139
This is stupid.
Why don't we call for backup?

551
00:32:52,174 --> 00:32:52,957
You know why.

552
00:32:53,186 --> 00:32:55,287
Because you think that
there's a mole tipping off our cell.

553
00:32:55,288 --> 00:32:56,768
It's a closed loop
if it's just you and me.

554
00:32:57,139 --> 00:32:58,183
All right, then
I'm coming in with you.

555
00:32:58,218 --> 00:32:59,534
No. It's a bad idea.

556
00:32:59,569 --> 00:33:00,604
I need you
to watch the perimeter.

557
00:33:00,654 --> 00:33:02,485
I will be back
in 30 minutes.

558
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,099
If I'm not,
you can call in the cavalry.

559
00:33:16,142 --> 00:33:17,036
I'm here
for the meeting.

560
00:33:33,484 --> 00:33:35,004
This is a word-of-mouth group.

561
00:33:35,273 --> 00:33:37,140
You're here because
someone we trust

562
00:33:37,632 --> 00:33:39,191
personally referred you.

563
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:41,828
This is how we do things.

564
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:44,075
This woman is a doctor.

565
00:33:44,971 --> 00:33:47,857
She'll be injecting a small dose
of anesthetic into each of you.

566
00:33:48,341 --> 00:33:49,284
Wait--wait a minute.

567
00:33:50,212 --> 00:33:53,502
Anesthetic for what...
exactly?

568
00:33:55,089 --> 00:33:56,383
Good evening
and welcome.

569
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:59,265
Tonight,
"Prime Focus with Chad Decker"

570
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,645
is proud to present

571
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,272
an up close and personal
interview with Anna,

572
00:34:03,603 --> 00:34:04,900
the Visitor high commander.

573
00:34:05,287 --> 00:34:07,278
On behalf of all of us,
I wanna thank you

574
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,576
for this opportunity to get
to know you a little better.

575
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,911
Thank you, Chad,

576
00:34:11,101 --> 00:34:13,702
and please, feel free
to ask anything and everything.

577
00:34:13,703 --> 00:34:16,239
I'm here to discuss all topics
without reserve.

578
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:38,328
I want you to confirm
that you see skull bone.

579
00:34:39,779 --> 00:34:41,157
Take a good look
at it.

580
00:34:41,897 --> 00:34:42,950
It's important.

581
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:47,137
You're next.

582
00:34:48,341 --> 00:34:49,637
<i>What is life like
where you come from?</i>

583
00:34:50,247 --> 00:34:52,128
<i>We come from a place
of great beauty,</i>

584
00:34:52,407 --> 00:34:54,708
<i>vast cities,
massive oceans.</i>

585
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:56,199
<i>Much like Earth.</i>

586
00:34:56,584 --> 00:34:57,578
<i>Though unlike you,</i>

587
00:34:57,646 --> 00:34:59,463
<i>we don't divide ourselves
into countries.</i>

588
00:34:59,811 --> 00:35:01,253
<i>We're one united people.</i>

589
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,448
You've all
passed the test.

590
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:05,208
Test for what?

591
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:08,068
To ensure
that you're not a Visitor.

592
00:35:11,148 --> 00:35:12,860
In order
to walk among us,

593
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:14,496
they disguise
their appearance

594
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:17,096
by cloning human flesh
over their own reptilian skin.

595
00:35:18,753 --> 00:35:20,453
I thought everyone here
was up to speed.

596
00:35:21,303 --> 00:35:23,704
The Visitors
didn't just <i>get</i> here.

597
00:35:23,976 --> 00:35:25,559
They've been here
for years.

598
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,676
<i>You've said we're
the only other intelligent life</i>

599
00:35:28,743 --> 00:35:30,178
<i>you've encountered
in your travels.</i>

600
00:35:30,539 --> 00:35:33,498
<i>Yes.
Humanity is a rare gift,</i>

601
00:35:34,163 --> 00:35:35,907
one we hold
in the highest regard.

602
00:35:35,942 --> 00:35:38,254
For decades, they've been
implementing a plan

603
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:40,038
that will result
in the extermination

604
00:35:40,073 --> 00:35:43,791
of every man, woman and child
on the face of this earth.

605
00:35:43,858 --> 00:35:47,053
We're honored and privileged
to be able to assist mankind

606
00:35:47,088 --> 00:35:48,613
with our knowledge
and technology.

607
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:52,748
Truth be told,
it stirs great emotion in us.

608
00:35:53,275 --> 00:35:54,802
So you are emotional beings?

609
00:35:55,201 --> 00:35:57,721
We are,
but we've evolved

610
00:35:57,756 --> 00:36:00,418
to quickly process and expel
all negative feelings.

611
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:02,710
Happiness, we've learned,

612
00:36:03,015 --> 00:36:04,757
comes from tranquility
and peace.

613
00:36:05,137 --> 00:36:06,601
V's posing as humans

614
00:36:06,636 --> 00:36:10,126
established themselves
in all facets of life,

615
00:36:10,161 --> 00:36:12,346
whether it be business,
government,

616
00:36:12,821 --> 00:36:15,029
religion, the military.

617
00:36:15,064 --> 00:36:16,809
It took years.

618
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:18,560
And once
embedded among us,

619
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:21,853
they set out to cause
worldwide instability--

620
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:25,393
Unnecessary wars,

621
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,202
economic meltdown,

622
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,312
faith twisted
into extremism.

623
00:36:31,347 --> 00:36:33,132
If you could speak
to the protesters,

624
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:34,255
what would you say?

625
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,252
<i>That embracing change
is never easy,</i>

626
00:36:37,657 --> 00:36:39,018
<i>but the reward
for doing so</i>

627
00:36:39,088 --> 00:36:41,481
<i>can be far greater than
anything you can imagine.</i>

628
00:36:46,492 --> 00:36:47,434
<i>Tonight
we're announcing</i>

629
00:36:47,504 --> 00:36:49,499
the expansion
of our healing centers.

630
00:36:49,855 --> 00:36:53,502
The goal is to open one in every
major city across the world.

631
00:36:53,931 --> 00:36:56,802
The final stage
of the Visitors' plan

632
00:36:56,837 --> 00:37:00,456
began with them
revealing themselves to us.

633
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,976
They gain trust
with the promise

634
00:37:03,011 --> 00:37:05,253
of friendship and technology.

635
00:37:05,288 --> 00:37:06,749
And, of course,
all they're really doing

636
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:11,386
is positioning themselves
as the saviors of mankind.

637
00:37:11,724 --> 00:37:13,784
The intent goes beyond
just healing.

638
00:37:14,549 --> 00:37:18,823
We want to provide complete
medical services to all.

639
00:37:19,811 --> 00:37:22,991
You're talking about...
universal health care?

640
00:37:23,654 --> 00:37:25,645
I believe that's what
you call it, yes.

641
00:37:27,729 --> 00:37:29,696
<i>By the time
people figure this out,</i>

642
00:37:30,157 --> 00:37:31,258
<i>it'll be too late.</i>

643
00:37:31,678 --> 00:37:32,793
<i>They'll take over...</i>

644
00:37:33,968 --> 00:37:36,440
<i>unless we can stop 'em.</i>

645
00:37:38,245 --> 00:37:39,617
I see the looks.

646
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,490
It's the first time hearing this
for some of you.

647
00:37:45,287 --> 00:37:46,505
You think we're crazy.

648
00:37:48,229 --> 00:37:48,740
Right?

649
00:37:50,673 --> 00:37:51,796
Do you have any proof?

650
00:37:51,986 --> 00:37:53,921
You know,
other than scary stories

651
00:37:53,988 --> 00:37:55,436
being passed around
the Internet.

652
00:37:56,091 --> 00:37:57,170
Who are you?

653
00:37:57,724 --> 00:37:58,840
Who referred you?

654
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:02,434
It doesn't matter.
I'm leaving.

655
00:38:02,469 --> 00:38:04,832
Wait, wait. I have proof...
I think.

656
00:38:05,392 --> 00:38:06,536
It's a bunch of photos--

657
00:38:06,537 --> 00:38:08,459
Supposedly
Visitors living on Earth.

658
00:38:24,516 --> 00:38:26,716
- This guy is a visitor?
- Yeah.

659
00:38:27,462 --> 00:38:29,756
This guy is
a terrorist.

660
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,167
He's part of a sleeper cell.

661
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:32,911
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

662
00:38:36,443 --> 00:38:37,798
A sleeper cell of visitors.

663
00:38:38,175 --> 00:38:40,963
Yeah, a sleeper cell
of visitors.

664
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:51,011
You did a brave thing
coming here tonight.

665
00:38:52,389 --> 00:38:54,787
Well, if I'm so brave,
why am I scared to death?

666
00:38:55,405 --> 00:38:56,664
I think
that makes you human.

667
00:38:59,122 --> 00:39:00,161
I'm Erica.

668
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:01,479
Jack.

669
00:39:14,123 --> 00:39:15,052
Get down!

670
00:40:05,892 --> 00:40:06,604
Ryan!

671
00:40:29,933 --> 00:40:30,875
What the hell, Dale?!

672
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,341
Aah! Aah!

673
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,004
No, Erica!

674
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,001
Let's go!

675
00:41:18,573 --> 00:41:20,058
Where the hell
did they come from?

676
00:41:20,523 --> 00:41:22,516
- We were so careful this time.
- Georgie--

677
00:41:22,551 --> 00:41:24,518
No. You were right
to walk away.

678
00:41:25,225 --> 00:41:26,352
- What hope do we have?
- There <i>is</i> hope.

679
00:41:26,387 --> 00:41:27,542
But they are animals!

680
00:41:27,592 --> 00:41:29,674
No. No.

681
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:31,895
Not all of them.

682
00:41:42,257 --> 00:41:43,926
I was wrong to walk away
from this, Georgie.

683
00:41:45,468 --> 00:41:46,824
You were right to fight.

684
00:41:48,665 --> 00:41:49,787
There's others out there
like me...

685
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:53,238
Other traitors, deserters.

686
00:41:55,584 --> 00:41:56,256
We'll help.

687
00:41:57,864 --> 00:41:58,839
Ryan.

688
00:42:01,112 --> 00:42:02,108
Where you going?

689
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,360
I gotta go tell Val
I'm leaving.

690
00:42:08,949 --> 00:42:11,148
It's not safe for her
to be around me anymore.

691
00:42:13,649 --> 00:42:14,647
Mr. Decker?

692
00:42:15,572 --> 00:42:18,376
Mr. Decker, may I have
a word with you, please?

693
00:42:20,263 --> 00:42:22,513
Anna loved you.

694
00:42:22,785 --> 00:42:23,688
I'm sure she did.

695
00:42:24,553 --> 00:42:26,985
She wants you to know we intend
to call on you again.

696
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,675
She trusts you.

697
00:42:29,127 --> 00:42:30,927
Yeah, I'm not so sure
<i>I</i> trust <i>her.</i>

698
00:42:32,613 --> 00:42:35,151
Look, I'm sorry for
the misunderstanding tonight,

699
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:36,314
but you did the right thing.

700
00:42:36,977 --> 00:42:39,175
Compromising one's principles
for the greater good

701
00:42:39,499 --> 00:42:41,694
is not a shameful act.
It's a noble one.

702
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:44,698
Really?
I find that hard to believe.

703
00:42:44,733 --> 00:42:46,673
Your people
are easily threatened.

704
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:47,995
What you did tonight

705
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:50,153
went a long way
toward reassuring them.

706
00:42:50,382 --> 00:42:51,235
What's the harm?

707
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,723
She backed me
into a corner.

708
00:42:54,123 --> 00:42:56,303
She could've chosen anyone
to interview her.

709
00:42:56,734 --> 00:42:58,108
She chose <i>you.</i>

710
00:42:59,726 --> 00:43:01,439
We would like to continue
with the arrangement.

711
00:43:01,474 --> 00:43:03,966
Whenever Anna has something
significant to say,

712
00:43:04,305 --> 00:43:06,185
we would like her
to say it through you.

713
00:43:09,148 --> 00:43:10,222
Unless you have
an aversion

714
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:12,630
to a worldwide audience
hanging on your every word.

715
00:43:49,731 --> 00:43:50,480
Val?

716
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,348
I hate myself.

717
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:04,625
You just--you kept getting
these calls from "no one," and...

718
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,294
I thought there was
somebody else.

719
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:12,084
I-I looked around
and I found this.

720
00:44:13,798 --> 00:44:15,152
You were gonna ask me
to marry you.

721
00:44:19,671 --> 00:44:21,882
I was even gonna
get down on one knee.

722
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:27,445
Do you still love me?

723
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:31,682
More than
you'll ever know.

724
00:44:37,123 --> 00:44:38,952
I don't know
who to trust anymore.

725
00:44:40,246 --> 00:44:41,192
I can't get the image

726
00:44:41,259 --> 00:44:43,077
of Dale just lying there
out of my head.

727
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,017
What do we do now?

728
00:44:59,451 --> 00:45:01,293
We help
build a resistance.

729
00:45:02,465 --> 00:45:04,529
We recruit...

730
00:45:04,811 --> 00:45:06,388
<i>Bring more into the fold.</i>

731
00:45:10,581 --> 00:45:12,030
We have to be careful.

732
00:45:12,065 --> 00:45:13,422
We'll be careful,

733
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:16,076
but we <i>have</i> to fight.

734
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:17,114
Oh, we'll fight.

735
00:45:19,482 --> 00:45:21,302
<i>They have
a big head start.</i>

736
00:45:22,766 --> 00:45:24,892
They're arming themselves
with the most...

737
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:28,288
powerful weapon out there.

738
00:45:29,744 --> 00:45:30,786
Yeah?
What's that?

739
00:45:36,675 --> 00:45:38,224
Erica, what big weapon?

740
00:45:40,665 --> 00:45:41,667
Devotion.

741
00:45:47,047 --> 00:45:48,750
To the dawn
of a new day.

742
00:45:49,302 --> 00:45:51,533
We are of peace always.
