1
00:00:00,939 --> 00:00:02,836
<i>Previously, on 90210....</i>

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:05,481
We have a new faculty advisor, Mr.
Cannon everyone.

3
00:00:05,648 --> 00:00:09,018
He said if I wanted back on
the Blaze I had to sleep with him.

4
00:00:09,185 --> 00:00:11,595
- There's going to be a hearing.
- I don't want a hearing.

5
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,579
You go in there, you tell the truth,
and everything's going to be fine.

6
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:18,411
I saw you at a cafe with
a handsome man.

7
00:00:18,578 --> 00:00:19,894
That kiss was a mistake.

8
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:22,606
I'm going to tell Harry everything
the minute he gets home.

9
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:26,359
- Are you sure that's a good idea?
- I wish I could bet on the Lakers.

10
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,904
- They're about to go on a roll.
- Someone's got the gambling bug.

11
00:00:30,154 --> 00:00:32,157
Why are you doing this?
Nothing happened.

12
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,243
- Why are you ruining my life?
- Nothing happened.

13
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:39,057
- I lied. Where are you going?
- Back to my mom's.

14
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,020
But you said that was the last
place in the world you want to be.

15
00:00:42,187 --> 00:00:44,040
I definitely don't want to be here.

16
00:00:49,376 --> 00:00:52,322
I'm gonna have to talk to the school
board to determine your punishment.

17
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:54,888
But trust me, there will
be severe consequences.

18
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,520
How's it going?

19
00:01:45,012 --> 00:01:46,721
- Sticky.
- Grab this.

20
00:01:46,992 --> 00:01:49,109
I have some graffiti
I'd like you to paint over.

21
00:02:06,884 --> 00:02:08,330
Kids can be cruel.

22
00:02:20,504 --> 00:02:21,796
She's a beauty.

23
00:02:21,963 --> 00:02:25,003
Don't know how the hell you built her
all by yourself, though.

24
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,386
Lot of hours.

25
00:02:26,553 --> 00:02:30,513
Guess I would come out here to work when
I got upset or pissed or whatever...

26
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,986
Looks like it hasn't been
the best year for you.

27
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:34,821
You could say that.

28
00:02:35,181 --> 00:02:36,925
It's all gonna turn around.

29
00:02:37,092 --> 00:02:40,862
Always does. Two weeks ago I was sharing
a cell with nine finger Nick,

30
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:43,463
and now I'm in CA getting ready
to go sailing with my kid.

31
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,947
You should've never been sent away.
You were framed.

32
00:02:46,114 --> 00:02:49,032
I know, but what's done is done.
Besides I'm here now.

33
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,203
For good.

34
00:02:51,303 --> 00:02:54,030
- You're staying in L.A.?
- Hell, yeah.

35
00:02:54,586 --> 00:02:57,548
I'm thinking about opening up a
tackle shop down by the marina.

36
00:02:57,715 --> 00:02:59,201
Could be pretty nice.

37
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,890
Just need a little seed money,
is all.

38
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,841
And then I can start looking for a
place for you and me to live nearby.

39
00:03:07,111 --> 00:03:08,021
Really?

40
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,206
I'm not gonna let you stay here
with that bastard of stepdad?

41
00:03:11,373 --> 00:03:12,720
Come on. Not an option.

42
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:33,296
I'm here for the future
zoologists of America meeting.

43
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,800
What's the only mammal that can survive
its entire life without drinking water?

44
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,968
- It's the rule.
- I'm your girlfriend.

45
00:03:41,094 --> 00:03:43,348
Fine.
Kangaroo rat. Happy?

46
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,308
See, was that so hard?

47
00:03:55,313 --> 00:03:58,863
All right! Ladies and gentlemen,
our dealer is here.

48
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:04,327
- That's everybody?
- Everyone on the evite.

49
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,871
- You sent out an evite?!
- Chill. Kidding.

50
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:09,707
Hilarious.

51
00:04:11,113 --> 00:04:12,560
Everybody ready?

52
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,341
Who's that?

53
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,051
- No idea.
- Go find out.

54
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,445
- Why me?
- 'Cause you wanted to be the door guy.

55
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:23,612
Go ahead.

56
00:04:27,753 --> 00:04:28,856
Who is it?

57
00:04:29,023 --> 00:04:30,160
<i>Kangaroo rat.</i>

58
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,603
<i>Let me in.</i>

59
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,285
So this is it.

60
00:04:41,354 --> 00:04:44,367
West Bev's very own
little underground speakeasy.

61
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:48,496
Nice job. I didn't know you had it
in you to organize something like this.

62
00:04:50,505 --> 00:04:52,750
- What are you doing here, Mark?
- I want in.

63
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:54,557
You're not invited.

64
00:04:56,593 --> 00:04:58,357
Maybe this will change your mind.

65
00:05:05,937 --> 00:05:08,808
Wait, you're not scared
you're gonna lose, are you?

66
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,320
Have a seat.

67
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,493
It'd be a pleasure
to take your money.

68
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:46,837
- Deb, you pick up the dry cleaning?
- I'm fine. Day was good, thanks.

69
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:48,723
I didn't pick up the dry cleaning.

70
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,351
I understand.
Obviously, you were very busy.

71
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:55,532
- What's going on?
- I jusy expected my dry cleaning.

72
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:58,905
I'm not talking about the dry cleaning.
What's going on with us?

73
00:05:59,072 --> 00:06:01,582
All this bitterness.
All this sniping.

74
00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:03,446
We should go to counseling.

75
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,730
What?

76
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,867
We don't need to go to counseling.
That's for people that have problems.

77
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,703
- We have problems.
- No, we have issues.

78
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,577
Issues that any couple is gonna
have after 20 years of marriage.

79
00:06:13,744 --> 00:06:15,166
- We don't.
- We do.

80
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,918
I kissed another man.

81
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:22,507
That didn't come out right.

82
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:26,619
He kissed me, actually.

83
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,349
It was my yoga teacher.
And it didn't mean anything.

84
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:35,853
When did this happen?

85
00:06:37,558 --> 00:06:38,808
Two months ago.

86
00:06:40,181 --> 00:06:41,431
Two months ago.

87
00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:47,620
And you didn't say anything?

88
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:01,170
And that's the third queen.
Looks like it's just you two.

89
00:07:07,714 --> 00:07:08,714
All in.

90
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:11,391
Call or fold?

91
00:07:14,498 --> 00:07:16,352
All right, I'll match that.

92
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:18,703
And...

93
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,593
I will raise you.

94
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,571
$6,175.

95
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:39,704
I don't have that here, but,

96
00:07:40,121 --> 00:07:42,211
will you give me a marker?
I'm good for it.

97
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:45,298
You sure?

98
00:07:47,256 --> 00:07:49,052
Yeah, I'm sure, trust me.

99
00:07:52,182 --> 00:07:54,499
- Will you give me the marker?
- That is not a problem.

100
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:58,144
I would be glad to take your money
in whatever form you'd like to give it.

101
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,648
All right.
Show your cards, boys.

102
00:08:06,684 --> 00:08:07,734
Full house.

103
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:12,742
- Nice.
- Nice! Full house.

104
00:08:13,712 --> 00:08:14,793
Nice hand.

105
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:16,641
Thank you.

106
00:08:17,587 --> 00:08:18,414
Unless...

107
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,540
Wait...

108
00:08:20,985 --> 00:08:22,710
Do four queens beat a full house?

109
00:08:24,425 --> 00:08:26,726
I don't know, I'm asking you guys.

110
00:08:26,893 --> 00:08:28,424
Does that...?
Does it...?

111
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:38,284
Don't worry about

112
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,543
getting the money to me right away.

113
00:08:40,801 --> 00:08:43,982
As long as you have it to me
by the end of the day tomorrow,

114
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:47,276
I won't have to have the guys on
the baseball team break your legs.

115
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,792

Season 02 episode 19
<i>Multiple Choices</i>

117
00:09:16,979 --> 00:09:18,425
This seat is saved.

118
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:20,716
- For who?
- My boyfriend.

119
00:09:20,883 --> 00:09:24,070
Have you seen him?
Blond, blue eyes, chiseled jaw.

120
00:09:24,237 --> 00:09:26,435
Muscles everywhere,
even in his ears.

121
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:28,601
Sounds like a
pretty good-looking dude.

122
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,778
You're way more my type.

123
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:34,749
What's up?
You've been all AWOL lately.

124
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:38,202
I got a big tournament coming up. I'm on
the court before and after school.

125
00:09:38,605 --> 00:09:41,194
Good thing I took notes
during SAT prep course.

126
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:43,603
You wanna come over tonight?
Go over some strategies?

127
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,370
I've got conditioning.

128
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:47,962
This is exigent.

129
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,129
The Sats are in two days.

130
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,466
It means urgent or pressing.

131
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:54,887
See, this is why you need to study.

132
00:09:55,281 --> 00:09:56,605
I'll be fine.

133
00:09:57,026 --> 00:09:59,599
Come on, Sats are important.
You gotta think about college.

134
00:10:00,654 --> 00:10:02,059
College isn't for everyone.

135
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:03,380
What?

136
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:06,189
I'm not planning on going,
at least not right away, anyway.

137
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:10,359
If I want to play professional tennis,
I have to do it now.

138
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,906
Sounds to me like you're
throwing away your future.

139
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,653
It sounds to me like
you're really judgmental.

140
00:10:18,563 --> 00:10:20,848
Tennis is my future, Silver.

141
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:23,998
And if you don't understand that,
maybe you don't understand me.

142
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,555
We come in from the bay,
and then we paddle out to this cave,

143
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:40,473
and out of nowhere, this tortoise
comes up to me, tips my kayak...

144
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:46,053
And so, I clobbered the tortoise,
and then I ate it.

145
00:10:49,913 --> 00:10:53,239
- What was that for?
- You're a million miles away right now.

146
00:10:53,655 --> 00:10:56,854
I thought you'd be a little bit
more excited to go out, since...

147
00:10:57,021 --> 00:10:58,580
You were the one who asked me.

148
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,414
You're right.

149
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:02,787
I'm sorry.
I am excited.

150
00:11:03,357 --> 00:11:04,330
Really.

151
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:08,055
There's nowhere I'd rather be
than right here with you, right now.

152
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,379
Honest.

153
00:11:12,543 --> 00:11:13,714
I got to take this.

154
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:15,976
I'm so sorry.

155
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:25,184
- Hey, Mark.
- <i>Little Dix,</i>

156
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:28,938
got your message. Really hope you
were calling 'cause you got my money.

157
00:11:30,377 --> 00:11:31,334
Sort of.

158
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:33,284
I was thinking...

159
00:11:33,722 --> 00:11:35,904
I got a pretty dope laptop

160
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,322
and some DJ equipment
that's fairly new, so...

161
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:42,535
I don't want your old crap.
Do you have the money or not?

162
00:11:43,738 --> 00:11:46,372
Look...
I just need a little more time.

163
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:47,785
You know...

164
00:11:48,844 --> 00:11:50,376
I could forget about the money.

165
00:11:51,262 --> 00:11:52,089
What?

166
00:11:52,256 --> 00:11:54,899
<i>As long as you do me a little favor.</i>

167
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:59,596
It's my girlfriend's birthday tomorrow,
and I want to decorate her locker

168
00:11:59,763 --> 00:12:02,906
so she's surprised when she
gets to school in the morning.

169
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,824
What? You want me
to get you streamers?

170
00:12:06,991 --> 00:12:08,269
No, smart-ass.

171
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:11,647
I need the key to the school,
so I can get in after hours.

172
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,257
Your dad's the principal. You can
figure out a way to make that happen.

173
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:19,767
If you don't want to help me,
that's fine.

174
00:12:19,934 --> 00:12:22,867
Just have the six grand in
cash for me tomorrow morning.

175
00:12:37,092 --> 00:12:38,642
It's no New York pizza,

176
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,810
but it's pretty good for L.A.

177
00:12:44,121 --> 00:12:46,683
- How did the job search go?
- No luck.

178
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:50,353
Surprise... turns out
nobody's interested in hiring an ex-con.

179
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,991
- You'll find something.
- Maybe I should take a page

180
00:12:53,158 --> 00:12:55,392
out of your mom's book and
marry my own billionaire.

181
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:57,190
You think Oprah would have me?

182
00:12:57,741 --> 00:12:59,862
Or maybe your mom's
billionaire could fund us.

183
00:13:00,716 --> 00:13:03,991
Stick with the Oprah route.
Can't ask that guy for a dime.

184
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,743
Who said anything about asking?

185
00:13:08,847 --> 00:13:10,111
I'm just kidding.

186
00:13:10,278 --> 00:13:13,709
This is what happens. You hang around
criminals, you end up thinking like one.

187
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,938
You got the key?

188
00:13:34,553 --> 00:13:35,591
Of course.

189
00:13:38,006 --> 00:13:40,986
- Can I have it?
- I'm not just going to give it to you.

190
00:13:41,316 --> 00:13:42,655
I'm going in with you.

191
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,382
Whatever. Suit yourself, man.

192
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:52,464
- What's going on?
- I forgot...

193
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,251
My girlfriend's birthday
is next month. My bad.

194
00:13:55,764 --> 00:13:58,129
- Tonight, we're stealing the Sats.
- Stealing...?

195
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:08,889
What the hell are you doing?

196
00:14:09,637 --> 00:14:12,062
You really are as slow
as you look, aren't you?

197
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,274
We... are... stealing...

198
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:16,355
The tests aren't even here.

199
00:14:17,151 --> 00:14:19,046
The tests are not usually here,

200
00:14:19,213 --> 00:14:21,444
but you see, this year,
West Bev is a test center,

201
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,904
- and rumor is...
- They're not here.

202
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,701
I heard my dad saying they don't get
delivered until the morning of the exam.

203
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,682
You can keep searching if you want.
You're not going to find anything.

204
00:14:40,515 --> 00:14:43,157
Let's go!
The tests aren't here.

205
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:46,385
You guys are real idiots.

206
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,851
I'm outta here.

207
00:15:32,954 --> 00:15:34,379
Dude.
What the hell?

208
00:15:34,546 --> 00:15:36,214
I'll see you guys later.

209
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:38,521
Good morning, Wilson.

210
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,607
Did you guys really do this?

211
00:15:42,036 --> 00:15:44,318
That test was going to bring
us some serious lettuce.

212
00:15:44,761 --> 00:15:46,320
My buddy Jason was pissed.

213
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,517
Plus, he's got to get into Stanford.

214
00:15:48,684 --> 00:15:52,223
He's not much for studying,
so he was double pissed.

215
00:15:53,563 --> 00:15:56,705
Come on! That's funny.
Have a sense of humor here.

216
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:58,055
Or a trophy.

217
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,814
Here... have a trophy.

218
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,101
It's not funny.

219
00:16:10,268 --> 00:16:12,930
How am I supposed to build an outfit
around florescent orange?

220
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:15,558
I don't want to take
a class with Mr. Cannon!

221
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,930
- What a pervert.
- Did you hear that?

222
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:20,796
It's not blowing over.

223
00:16:21,075 --> 00:16:23,131
It will, I promise.

224
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:25,297
Just give it some more time.

225
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:29,071
I have a better idea.
Get everybody's attention.

226
00:16:30,306 --> 00:16:31,902
Fine, I'll do it myself.

227
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,825
Excuse me, everyone!

228
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,939
I have an announcement
I have to make.

229
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,424
Mr. Cannon is not a molester.

230
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,078
He's not a pervert.

231
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,046
I am the pervert.

232
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,713
I perverted justice.

233
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,763
I perverted morality.

234
00:16:58,082 --> 00:16:59,560
I perverted his life.

235
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:02,172
He didn't do anything wrong.

236
00:17:03,776 --> 00:17:05,524
And I apologize again

237
00:17:06,132 --> 00:17:07,901
for spreading such a vicious lie.

238
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:11,921
And trust me, I get it if you don't
ever want to speak to me again.

239
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:14,285
Like I said,

240
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,202
I am the pervert here.

241
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:19,622
Pervert! Pervert! Pervert!

242
00:17:22,832 --> 00:17:24,418
Come on down from there.

243
00:17:25,484 --> 00:17:27,338
You really shouldn't have done that.

244
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,588
- You really shouldn't have done that.
- I had to.

245
00:17:31,157 --> 00:17:32,613
We're proud of you.

246
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,971
A little embarrassed to be seen with
you right now, but definitely proud.

247
00:17:36,715 --> 00:17:38,598
Does that mean you forgive me?

248
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:42,019
- We've all done bad stuff.
- Speak for yourself.

249
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,359
Of course we forgive you.

250
00:17:45,526 --> 00:17:47,857
Clearly, you know what
you did was wrong, so...

251
00:17:48,024 --> 00:17:50,057
Perverted, actually.

252
00:17:52,331 --> 00:17:53,697
I missed you guys so much.

253
00:17:55,782 --> 00:17:57,504
Hug! Group hugs!

254
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:07,086
- You wanted to see me?
- Take a seat.

255
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,349
Dad, I wasn't...

256
00:18:25,628 --> 00:18:27,648
- I broke into the school, but...
- But what?

257
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:30,996
I didn't do any of the vandalism.
That wasn't me.

258
00:18:31,163 --> 00:18:33,028
It was your friends.
You just went along.

259
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,177
They aren't my friends. I had
no idea what they were gonna be doing.

260
00:18:36,344 --> 00:18:38,870
- I didn't even wanna be here...
- Then why were you?

261
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:42,079
- I was just...
- Dixon, why were you there?

262
00:18:43,368 --> 00:18:44,936
I didn't even mean...

263
00:18:53,373 --> 00:18:54,633
I've been gambling.

264
00:18:56,892 --> 00:18:57,845
For a while.

265
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,346
At first it was sports,

266
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,031
then it turned into poker, and,

267
00:19:02,198 --> 00:19:04,345
I guess
I kind of got a little over my head.

268
00:19:04,512 --> 00:19:07,987
'Cause I lost a lot of money to a kid,
and I couldn't pay him back.

269
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:11,775
He asked me to break into
the school, and I agreed.

270
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:15,210
Because I had no other choice.
I owed him money.

271
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:17,768
So,

272
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:21,979
I stole your key to the school,
and I broke in.

273
00:19:23,065 --> 00:19:25,956
Turns out that the kid and his
friends just wanted to steal the Sats.

274
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:28,250
When they found out
that it wasn't here,

275
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:31,407
- they vandalized the school.
- They?

276
00:19:33,794 --> 00:19:34,902
Who are they?

277
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,469
Who are the kids in the masks?

278
00:19:49,236 --> 00:19:50,551
I got all day.

279
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,781
Mark Driscott,

280
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,757
Nat Frazier,

281
00:20:01,537 --> 00:20:02,767
Jason Brewer,

282
00:20:04,215 --> 00:20:05,412
Steve Peterson.

283
00:20:15,224 --> 00:20:18,425
I heard about what you
did in the cafeteria.

284
00:20:20,827 --> 00:20:23,388
A rather unorthodox
approach to repentance,

285
00:20:23,863 --> 00:20:26,225
but fundamentally courageous of you.

286
00:20:26,698 --> 00:20:28,936
So, thank you.

287
00:20:29,977 --> 00:20:31,377
I really am sorry.

288
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:34,233
I never meant for
all this to happen.

289
00:20:34,704 --> 00:20:37,194
I know, and I appreciate that.

290
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,191
Don't be late for class.

291
00:21:01,364 --> 00:21:02,364
What?

292
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:06,024
I should've been honest a long time ago,
but I would like to be honest now.

293
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:07,241
Novel idea.

294
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:09,434
Fine, I deserve that.

295
00:21:11,983 --> 00:21:14,139
Good thing our project's graded
on a curve?

296
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:17,108
Cause I'm pretty sure the tall kid
with the fauxhawk can't even read.

297
00:21:19,505 --> 00:21:23,340
The reason I didn't tell you
about kissing Kai was because I...

298
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:26,285
I felt something for
him when he kissed me.

299
00:21:27,294 --> 00:21:28,507
Maybe I should just...

300
00:21:28,674 --> 00:21:30,455
I can't believe that I'm
hearing this.

301
00:21:30,705 --> 00:21:34,334
- How could you be so selfish?
- Wait a minute this isn't all my fault.

302
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,536
I'm not the one that's kissing
other people!

303
00:21:36,703 --> 00:21:38,950
You're just the one who goes to work
flirts with them

304
00:21:39,117 --> 00:21:41,127
and then comes home
and doesn't talk to me.

305
00:21:41,294 --> 00:21:43,093
You're selfish, too. And...

306
00:21:43,992 --> 00:21:45,530
- And you're cold.
- Cold?

307
00:21:45,697 --> 00:21:47,632
I'm cold?! How dare you!

308
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:50,183
How dare I what?
State what's been obvious for months?

309
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:52,273
You have been living in
your own world.

310
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,210
Completely oblivious
to everything that I have been feeling.

311
00:21:55,377 --> 00:21:57,427
It's like you're not even here.

312
00:21:57,891 --> 00:21:58,891
And Kai...

313
00:22:00,644 --> 00:22:02,779
Fine... my yoga teacher... was.

314
00:22:03,784 --> 00:22:05,073
He was compassionate

315
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:08,573
and understanding,
and he listened to me when I spoke.

316
00:22:09,076 --> 00:22:10,954
And he wanted to know
what I was feeling.

317
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,100
I stopped that kiss because it was
the right thing to do.

318
00:22:18,294 --> 00:22:20,088
Not because I wanted to.

319
00:22:28,102 --> 00:22:29,806
Come on, let's get out of here.

320
00:22:40,853 --> 00:22:42,753
We need to go to counseling.

321
00:22:54,362 --> 00:22:55,412
This sucks.

322
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,961
At least your family
just started sucking now.

323
00:23:00,371 --> 00:23:02,471
Mine's sucked since I was seven.

324
00:23:03,017 --> 00:23:05,717
- That's when my parents got divorced.
- You were that young?

325
00:23:06,443 --> 00:23:08,443
I guess it was good, in a way.

326
00:23:09,082 --> 00:23:11,170
Less time to think
my parents were great,

327
00:23:11,337 --> 00:23:13,965
and more time to realize
they're just people.

328
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:17,095
It still sucked, though.

329
00:23:17,726 --> 00:23:20,476
It's not fair.
You know, none of this is fair.

330
00:23:22,829 --> 00:23:25,600
I just, I want to kick something
or scream or just,

331
00:23:26,093 --> 00:23:27,485
you know, run away

332
00:23:27,652 --> 00:23:30,242
or I don't know, I just...

333
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,873
Annie, what...

334
00:23:45,894 --> 00:23:47,050
What are you doing?

335
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,450
I don't know.

336
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:50,869
I don't know!

337
00:23:54,626 --> 00:23:57,669
I don't know why I just did that.
But I just felt really frustrated

338
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:00,886
- and I had to do something.
- That was something.

339
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:02,147
Here.

340
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,740
Are you okay?

341
00:24:07,862 --> 00:24:08,862
It's cold!

342
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,723
- I think it's great!
- Yeah, you're crazy.

343
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,850
Come here, crazy.

344
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:25,088
How come when I get out of
the water, it's so cold?

345
00:24:26,172 --> 00:24:27,172
Come here.

346
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:31,009
- Thanks.
- Sure.

347
00:24:40,761 --> 00:24:42,230
You should be with Naomi.

348
00:24:43,955 --> 00:24:44,955
What?

349
00:24:45,173 --> 00:24:48,528
I know what she did was messed up,
but she did the right thing in the end.

350
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:52,199
And, and she's sorry.
And that's gotta count for something.

351
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,451
So, you should forgive her.

352
00:25:12,171 --> 00:25:13,171
Ace.

353
00:25:14,925 --> 00:25:18,141
It's a serve where the tennis ball
is not touched by the receiver.

354
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,521
I may have added a couple,
tennis flashcards to my vocab deck.

355
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:27,109
You love tennis, so...
I'm going to learn to love tennis.

356
00:25:29,534 --> 00:25:32,016
You were right,
I was completely judgmental.

357
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,574
The fight was all my fault.

358
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,687
Which also happens to be a serve

359
00:25:36,854 --> 00:25:39,246
that fails to be placed in the
correct area of the court.

360
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,853
And this is a huge opportunity,
once in a lifetime.

361
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,710
You should see where it takes you.

362
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,821
- Really?
- Really.

363
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,610
And I'm gonna be at your big match.

364
00:25:52,206 --> 00:25:53,370
I appreciate it,

365
00:25:53,537 --> 00:25:56,221
but you don't have to stay.
Just knowing you support me is enough.

366
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:57,971
Yeah, but I want to.

367
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,268
I don't think you even believe that.
You hate sporting events.

368
00:26:01,931 --> 00:26:03,443
I don't want you to have to sit

369
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:06,450
through a boring three-hour match out
in the sun just for me.

370
00:26:06,617 --> 00:26:09,776
Besides, it is more exigent
that you use this time to study.

371
00:26:12,443 --> 00:26:15,031
Okay, are you sure?
Cause I want to be here for you.

372
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,910
I'm positive.

373
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,050
Game, match, set.

374
00:26:22,565 --> 00:26:23,565
You win.

375
00:26:39,928 --> 00:26:41,028
You're here.

376
00:26:47,126 --> 00:26:49,713
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. It's my fault. I...

377
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,278
No, what you did was wrong,
but you did the right thing in the end.

378
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:59,034
And... that was brave of you.
I should have been there for you.

379
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:01,839
I missed you so much.

380
00:27:02,313 --> 00:27:05,081
Believe me, I will never do
anything like this again.

381
00:27:07,305 --> 00:27:08,460
I love you, Liam.

382
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:11,172
You, too.

383
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,520
Surprise!

384
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,867
What are you doing here?
I thought you weren't coming.

385
00:27:25,034 --> 00:27:27,649
I wasn't,
and then I changed my mind.

386
00:27:28,078 --> 00:27:29,658
I really want to support you.

387
00:27:30,052 --> 00:27:33,341
And I brought some sat study cards,
in case I get bored.

388
00:27:35,742 --> 00:27:38,202
I guess I should go
sit in your section.

389
00:27:38,861 --> 00:27:41,326
I assume I just follow
the cell phone cameras

390
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,727
and ogling stares to your father.
Is that him over there?

391
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,727
Yeah, that's my dad...
I don't think it's...

392
00:27:49,177 --> 00:27:52,003
Just go do your thing.
I'll go sit with him, okay?

393
00:27:55,089 --> 00:27:56,675
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

394
00:28:00,368 --> 00:28:01,918
Silver, Silver, wait!

395
00:28:11,819 --> 00:28:13,692
- Hi, I'm Silver.
- Hi.

396
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,945
You want an autograph?

397
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,822
- You have a pen?
- I'm Erin Silver.

398
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:20,839
I'm sorry.

399
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:22,909
I'm Teddy's girlfriend.

400
00:28:24,322 --> 00:28:26,122
So Teddy has a girlfriend?

401
00:28:28,163 --> 00:28:29,363
Yeah, he does.

402
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,100
It was really nice to meet you.

403
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,957
I just, I realized that I gotta...
I gotta go.

404
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:44,014
- So, enjoy the match.
- Okay, thank you.

405
00:28:59,691 --> 00:29:00,691
So?

406
00:29:00,858 --> 00:29:03,616
So, the superintendent called
and said she was gonna expel

407
00:29:03,866 --> 00:29:06,244
whoever was responsible
for the break-in.

408
00:29:07,687 --> 00:29:09,293
And I said that there was

409
00:29:09,932 --> 00:29:11,792
a glitch on the security tapes,

410
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,627
- so we couldn't see who it was.
- You did?

411
00:29:15,072 --> 00:29:17,804
If you get expelled, it ruins
your chances of getting into college.

412
00:29:17,971 --> 00:29:19,735
I'm not going to let that happen.

413
00:29:19,902 --> 00:29:21,867
No, don't, don't thank me yet.

414
00:29:22,034 --> 00:29:24,346
As of now, your life
outside of school is over.

415
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:28,638
No going out, no car, no cell phone
except for in emergencies.

416
00:29:29,803 --> 00:29:31,503
And no more video games.

417
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:37,450
And obviously, you mention
this to none of your friends.

418
00:29:37,617 --> 00:29:38,667
You got it?

419
00:29:42,472 --> 00:29:43,615
Did you tell mom?

420
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:47,077
No, your mom's got a
lot going on right now.

421
00:29:47,879 --> 00:29:49,667
If she asks why
you're not going out,

422
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:52,248
just tell her you're
focusing on your schoolwork.

423
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,422
I'm really sorry.

424
00:30:00,144 --> 00:30:01,344
Yeah, me, too.

425
00:30:03,562 --> 00:30:06,096
Me, too. I thought you were
better than this.

426
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,387
What are you doing here?

427
00:30:16,635 --> 00:30:19,359
Actually, this is my house,
so I can go wherever I want.

428
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:22,821
I'm actually thinking

429
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,644
about turning
the carriage house into a gym.

430
00:30:26,337 --> 00:30:30,097
Put my elliptical machine over there,
the free weights there in that corner

431
00:30:30,264 --> 00:30:33,373
- But this is where I work on my boat.
- Not anymore.

432
00:30:34,957 --> 00:30:38,054
- What are you gonna do punch me again?
- You deserve so much worse than that

433
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:41,464
for cheating on my mom. Believe me, it's
a matter of time before she leaves you.

434
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,521
Then you don't know
your mother very well, do you?

435
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:48,138
Cause believe it or not,
Colleen and I are closer than ever.

436
00:30:49,276 --> 00:30:51,726
And we're very worried
about you, son.

437
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:55,562
See, it's not normal for a young man to
spend all of his time alone in a shed.

438
00:30:56,102 --> 00:30:58,626
That's why, when she goes away
to Europe next month,

439
00:30:58,793 --> 00:31:00,843
I'm gonna start my renovations.

440
00:31:02,495 --> 00:31:05,447
- Mom's going to Europe?
- What, she didn't tell you?

441
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,824
Yeah, she's going on a
spa week in Switzerland.

442
00:31:09,392 --> 00:31:10,792
You know, at first

443
00:31:11,136 --> 00:31:14,122
she was actually hesitant
to leave us here alone.

444
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,528
But I promised her
that we'd be fine.

445
00:31:16,695 --> 00:31:19,539
So it's just gonna be you
and me alone, for a week.

446
00:31:19,706 --> 00:31:21,045
I can hardly wait.

447
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,205
So, how was your day?

448
00:31:50,616 --> 00:31:51,716
It was fine.

449
00:31:52,256 --> 00:31:54,216
You know, some challenges, but fine.

450
00:31:55,067 --> 00:31:56,505
- How was your day?
- Good.

451
00:31:57,098 --> 00:32:00,151
Funny thing happened.
I ran into Cindy at Trader Joe's.

452
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,754
Do you remember her
from the fundraiser last month?

453
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,444
- Yes, how is she?
- Good, she looks good.

454
00:32:05,611 --> 00:32:07,778
I think she put
some highlights in her hair.

455
00:32:07,945 --> 00:32:09,093
May I be excused?

456
00:32:09,652 --> 00:32:11,847
But we just sat down.
You hardly touched your food.

457
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:15,501
I'll take my plate with me. I just have
a lot of studying to do for the Sats.

458
00:32:16,066 --> 00:32:17,977
- Sure
- Okay. Thanks.

459
00:32:32,591 --> 00:32:35,328
Look, I'm sorry, but I gotta
cancel our plans for tonight.

460
00:32:36,682 --> 00:32:38,540
Okay. Why?

461
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,916
I'm grounded.

462
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,626
You're grounded for what?

463
00:32:42,663 --> 00:32:43,670
Nothing.

464
00:32:44,873 --> 00:32:47,649
If you're not grounded for anything,
then why can't we hang?

465
00:32:47,816 --> 00:32:50,260
Look, I... I can't really
talk about it right now.

466
00:32:50,838 --> 00:32:51,838
Okay?

467
00:32:52,005 --> 00:32:54,889
Fine, whatever, Dixon.
I'll see you tomorrow at school, okay?

468
00:33:01,894 --> 00:33:05,817
- What's up?
- So, dinner was pretty awkward.

469
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:10,113
And listen, I think it's because...

470
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,198
I'm sorry,
I've had a really bad day.

471
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,660
Can we not talk about this?

472
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:17,921
Yeah, sure.

473
00:33:18,515 --> 00:33:19,565
No problem.

474
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,867
Dad, listen, I've been
thinking about the tackle shop.

475
00:33:32,034 --> 00:33:34,485
Don't worry about it, kid.
I'll figure it out.

476
00:33:34,652 --> 00:33:37,793
- It's just gonna take some time.
- Maybe I can help speed things up.

477
00:33:41,147 --> 00:33:44,564
I appreciate the gesture, but it's gonna
take a lot more than 30 cents.

478
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,941
These are worth
a lot more than 30 cts.

479
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,403
They're from
my stepdad's collection.

480
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,363
- Like how much more?
- Ten thousand dollars more.

481
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,450
I just can't stay here anymore.

482
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:04,083
Use the money to open the tackle shop
and get your own place.

483
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,711
Then I can get the hell out
of here and move in with you.

484
00:34:23,852 --> 00:34:25,772
You've reached Liam.
Leave a message.

485
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:28,868
Hi, it's me.

486
00:34:29,512 --> 00:34:31,164
I mean, it's Annie.

487
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,322
Look, I just wanted
someone to talk to.

488
00:34:34,854 --> 00:34:37,364
My parents are acting
like nothing's wrong.

489
00:34:37,531 --> 00:34:39,788
And Dixon doesn't
want to talk, and...

490
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,979
I just really don't
wanna be here anymore.

491
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:46,959
I just feel trapped.

492
00:34:48,098 --> 00:34:49,836
But anyway, call me?

493
00:34:52,597 --> 00:34:55,587
To send your message with
normal delivery, press one.

494
00:34:55,987 --> 00:34:57,487
To erase, press two.

495
00:34:58,776 --> 00:34:59,847
Message erased.

496
00:35:11,155 --> 00:35:13,820
- Hey, did you just call me?
- Oh, my God, no.

497
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,151
I must've pocket dialed you
or something. I'm sorry.

498
00:35:20,121 --> 00:35:21,160
Okay, cool.

499
00:35:21,764 --> 00:35:24,323
- So...
- So, I will see you tomorrow at school.

500
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:26,867
Sure, see you at school.

501
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:06,037
May I please get five
brain booster smoothies

502
00:36:06,204 --> 00:36:08,166
with acai extract
and an energy boost?

503
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:11,836
And can you label four of them "Silver,"
"Adrianna," "Annie" and "Liam"?

504
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,171
Anything for you.

505
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,298
So, what's all this
brain boosting for?

506
00:36:15,801 --> 00:36:17,550
- Sats.
- You nervous?

507
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,290
Actually, I'm not.
I'm feeling pretty good about it.

508
00:36:20,457 --> 00:36:22,007
Are you now, sweetie?

509
00:36:23,852 --> 00:36:25,702
Do close your mouth, Naomi.

510
00:36:26,348 --> 00:36:28,798
That's really not
a good look for you.

511
00:36:31,325 --> 00:36:33,316
So, do you like what
I'm doing to the place?

512
00:36:34,538 --> 00:36:36,729
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, the beach club.

513
00:36:36,896 --> 00:36:39,405
It was a wedding
present from Olivier.

514
00:36:40,176 --> 00:36:41,978
He really is too generous.

515
00:36:42,465 --> 00:36:44,524
We decided to give our
marriage another go.

516
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:46,913
I forgave him for cheating,
and in exchange

517
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,373
he told me we could live
anywhere in the world.

518
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:53,586
I guess there is no place like home.

519
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:57,837
- You moved here? You're back?
- Please.

520
00:36:58,561 --> 00:37:00,551
I wasn't going to
let you keep me away.

521
00:37:02,928 --> 00:37:05,028
I suppose I should let you know,

522
00:37:06,112 --> 00:37:07,934
I'm a little upset with you.

523
00:37:09,072 --> 00:37:12,560
You turned your back on me.
That really wasn't very nice.

524
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:16,442
And you know me,
I do tend to hold grudges.

525
00:37:19,778 --> 00:37:21,241
Call me karma, babe.

526
00:37:23,215 --> 00:37:24,882
And karma is a bitch.

527
00:37:26,033 --> 00:37:28,783
Okay, five smoothies
ready to go, Ms. Clark.

528
00:37:40,743 --> 00:37:42,523
You want a power bar?

529
00:37:43,081 --> 00:37:44,961
My mom made me take
like six this morning

530
00:37:45,128 --> 00:37:47,019
just in case I got hungry
during the test.

531
00:37:47,186 --> 00:37:48,731
I'm cool, thank you.

532
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:54,105
I just gotta say it kinda feels like
you were blowing me off last night.

533
00:37:54,913 --> 00:37:56,658
Look, I swear I wasn't.

534
00:37:57,738 --> 00:37:58,738
All right?

535
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:02,029
Things at home, they...
just aren't great right now.

536
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:06,367
- I really like you, Ivy.
- Okay.

537
00:38:07,006 --> 00:38:08,286
No, I'm serious.

538
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,037
I really, really like you.

539
00:38:10,867 --> 00:38:12,123
You have to know that.

540
00:38:16,723 --> 00:38:18,123
But, I have to go.

541
00:38:19,191 --> 00:38:21,632
I'm so sorry and I'll make it up to you.
I promise.

542
00:38:22,297 --> 00:38:24,497
- Good luck on the test.
- Right.

543
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:30,016
What's up, little Dix?
You got my money?

544
00:38:30,758 --> 00:38:33,519
- What?!
- "What?!" Come on, man.

545
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:37,399
I got the shaft in this deal.
No money, no Sats, nothing.

546
00:38:37,566 --> 00:38:39,411
Dude, I got you into the school.

547
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:41,933
I held up my part of the bargain.

548
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,447
You should be thanking me...
you could've been expelled.

549
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:48,034
My dad has tapes of us in the hallway
that night. He knows it was you.

550
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:51,392
He could've gone to the
superintendent, but he didn't.

551
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,414
So I think we're kind of even.

552
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:55,207
Interesting.

553
00:39:00,295 --> 00:39:01,795
Why are you smiling?

554
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:05,509
Now I know the principal
covered up to save his son.

555
00:39:08,191 --> 00:39:10,491
That's gonna come in handy someday.

556
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:12,316
See ya, bud.

557
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:52,473
You haven't returned
any of my calls.

558
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,308
Take your seats, everyone.

559
00:39:56,421 --> 00:39:57,645
So, are we okay?

560
00:39:59,281 --> 00:40:00,281
Seriously?

561
00:40:02,607 --> 00:40:04,607
No, we're definitely not okay.

562
00:40:05,488 --> 00:40:07,405
Go sit down.
The test is gonna start.

563
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:23,602
Please be sure to mark
your answers clearly

564
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:25,141
on the answer sheet.

565
00:40:25,985 --> 00:40:27,835
And be mindful of the time.

566
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:39,977
Every second counts.

567
00:40:41,312 --> 00:40:45,212
If you have any questions,
raise your hand, and I will come to you.

568
00:40:45,379 --> 00:40:47,079
Good luck to all of you.

569
00:40:50,929 --> 00:40:52,129
You may begin.
