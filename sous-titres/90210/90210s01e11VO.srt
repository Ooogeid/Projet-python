1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,720
90210:

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,520
We have a son together.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,590
I want to hire a private investigator

4
00:00:05,691 --> 00:00:06,691
To find him.

5
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,030
What did you say to Ryan?

6
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,590
- About what? - About me.

7
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,300
Not much.

8
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,100
You shouldn't have said anything.

9
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,600
I'm heading in your direction

10
00:00:14,601 --> 00:00:16,601
If you want a ride.

11
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,870
How do you know where I'm heading?

12
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,440
I don't.

13
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,770
I don't like games.

14
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,640
And I don't like people who play games.

15
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,810
Oh, my god, Jason.

16
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,980
Listen to me.

17
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,250
Everything you have done

18
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,280
Was just to set me up to ruin my birthday?

19
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,220
Absolutely.

20
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,690
Being your friend? I'm over it.

21
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,850
I already beat you to it.

22
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,190
Excuse me. My name's Sean.

23
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,020
I'm the son of Harry Wilson and Tracy Clark.

24
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,130
Hi.

25
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,600
I'm Naomi.

26
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,900
Your half-sister.

27
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,540
Yes. Of course. Hello.

28
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,740
Hi.

29
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,410
Um, hi. I'm annie.

30
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,810
I'm your half-sister as well, actually.

31
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,750
How about that? You all are sisters?

32
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,450
- God, no! - No, .

33
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,250
Um, definitely not.

34
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,190
Well, I guess the fight is over,

35
00:01:10,191 --> 00:01:12,091
Without bloodshed,

36
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,560
So I guess that's a plus.

37
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,260
Yeah, but who's G.I. Joe?

38
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,660
Beats me.

39
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,730
As long as he's not another one of her exes.

40
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,900
I say screw etiquette.

41
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:22,700
Let's dig in.

42
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,440
No! We're waiting for Annie.

43
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,770
I'm positively starved!

44
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,970
Eat a pig in a blanket.

45
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,680
What does she mean by that?

46
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,380
Is that some sort of Kansas-style vulgarity?

47
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,380
Tabitha, I was not insulting you.

48
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:36,750
Why don't you eat a pig in a blanket?

49
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,980
How about that?

50
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,550
That lady...

51
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,490
Oh, the stories I could tell you.

52
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,760
This is my dad.

53
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,200
Harry Wilson?

54
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,000
Yep.

55
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,230
Sean Cavanaugh.

56
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,000
I believe that I'm your son.

57
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,940
My... my son?

58
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,610
Yes, sir.

59
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,280
Roman coins would melt with envy.

60
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,780
What a profile!

61
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,120
Oh. well, thanks.

62
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,690
It's similar to yours, Harry.

63
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,560
Definitely a Wilson Nose,

64
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,000
But a little less, how would you say...?

65
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:23,201
"Schnozzy."

66
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,630
Dad's not schnozzy.

67
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,360
I don't mean it in a bad way.

68
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,130
Well, I'd be proud to have a Wilson nose.

69
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,770
A Wilson nose.

70
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,400
It really does kind of look like dad's,

71
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,901
Doesn't it?

72
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,840
Go on-- before you turned your head,

73
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,080
You were telling us about how you enlisted.

74
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,280
Are you one of those patriotic Americans

75
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:43,081
- I hear so much about? - Right. well,

76
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,720
Service to my country is very important to me.

77
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,690
But the military is also an opportunity.

78
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,050
You know, a college scholarship,

79
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,520
A chance to see the world.

80
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,690
Not that sadr city and Basra

81
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,060
Were my first choices but, hey,

82
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,790
You take what you can get.

83
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,030
How is it to be over there?

84
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,300
It's crazy. That's for sure.

85
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,800
But it's all right. You know, in some ways,

86
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,970
It's less crazy than where I came from.

87
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,370
What do you mean?

88
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,610
Aw, nothing. nothing. I just... I didn't

89
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,410
Exactly have the most stable upbringing.

90
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,220
I certainly didn't grow up in a place like this.

91
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,080
So where did you grow up?

92
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,720
South Carolina.

93
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,450
That's where I was when I was on leave

94
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,090
When a private investigator showed up,

95
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,830
Told me my birth parents were looking for me.

96
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,830
I gotta tell you, I couldn't believe it.

97
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,600
But then I figured, if not now, when?

98
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,970
You know, I've got to ship out in the next few weeks,

99
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,900
And, well, you never know.

100
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,570
I might not ever have another chance to meet y'all.

101
00:03:39,571 --> 00:03:41,571
Where's everybody hiding?

102
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,410
My son!

103
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,280
Tracy Clark?

104
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,020
Mom!

105
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,840
Look at us,

106
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:00,400
We're just one big happy family now. Isn't it great?

107
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,100
I hope Sean is okay at the Clarks'.

108
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,930
Yeah, right.

109
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,370
I don't want to talk about it.

110
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,770
Hon, did you want Sean to stay here?

111
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,370
Because I'm sorry I didn't invite him. I just figured

112
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,440
- It was your call. - No, no. that's okay.

113
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,250
It would have been weird.

114
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,980
More weird potentially.

115
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,790
Are you going to call him tomorrow?

116
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,390
I... what do you guys think?

117
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,960
Annie?

118
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,260
Yeah. I'm fine with Sean.

119
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,870
It's cool with me.

120
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,900
I'll tell you how I feel.

121
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,500
Old.

122
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,540
Now I have to reconfigure all my math.

123
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:17,050
Dixon, if I want to be 54,

124
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,420
How old do I have to say I was when I had your father

125
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,990
Now that he has a 25-year-old son

126
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,260
He conceived when he was 18?

127
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,720
Eleven.

128
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,360
Hmm. That's a little unseemly.

129
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,500
What about you, sweetie?

130
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,300
How do you feel?

131
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,940
You know, Harry, i...

132
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,140
I don't think this has anything to do with me.

133
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:45,640
Sean is your son. How do you feel?

134
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,180
I feel... I feel like I have a son,

135
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:54,320
And I haven't been any sort of father to him.

136
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,320
Maybe he could tell people he's only 20.

137
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,060
That would help me.

138
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,540
Hey, girlfriend?

139
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes, boyfriend?

140
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,370
Nothing,nothing.

141
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,570
I just... I just like saying that.

142
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,680
I like hearing it.

143
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,880
Naomi.

144
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,410
No. it's Ethan.

145
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,380
No. Naomi's right there.

146
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,650
So?

147
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,050
So I wish she wasn't.

148
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,090
I wish she would transfer to Uzbekistan.

149
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,260
Or opt for home schooling.

150
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,490
Or spontaneously combust.

151
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,760
All right. Take it easy.

152
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,360
She ruined my birthday party,

153
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,960
And tried to break us up.

154
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,060
But she didn't.

155
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,760
We're together, Annie.

156
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,730
We're so together we're like siamese twins,

157
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,300
Except only of different genders and not related,

158
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,270
And we're sexually attracted to each other.

159
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,810
What's up, Ms. gameplayer?

160
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,780
Well, Ozzie. Fancy meeting you here.

161
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,920
Well, that must feel strange.

162
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,350
You okay?

163
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,050
Better than okay.

164
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,560
Okay.

165
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,860
'Cause if you weren't,

166
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,630
And you want to talk or anything...

167
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,500
No. That's... that's really sweet of you.

168
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,270
I have to say, it'll be a cold day in Tijuana

169
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,900
Before I'd ever ask you for anything.

170
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,540
And that's your cue to leave.

171
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,870
Right. Of course.

172
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,150
Annie.Hey.

173
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,020
I just checked in with your dad.

174
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,720
He said you had kind of a big weekend.

175
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,490
So how about we talk in my office?

176
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,420
You know, that's okay. thanks anyway.

177
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,660
I really don't feel like talking about anything.

178
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,060
I was kind of trying to make you feel like you had a choice.

179
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,460
You don't. How about we talk in my office?

180
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,660
Delightful.

181
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,160
So how is the thing?

182
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,900
How is the new brother?

183
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,930
I was expecting a full debriefing last night.

184
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,770
That what you're calling it-- debriefing?

185
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,240
That's funny.

186
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,170
I always took you for a boxers kind of guy.

187
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,070
Yeah. well, it was all pretty exhausting,

188
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,610
So I just hit the hay, you know?

189
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,660
I mean, he seems nice,

190
00:08:02,661 --> 00:08:04,661
And my dad wants to get him some normal.

191
00:08:04,662 --> 00:08:07,162
- So I guess that's nice. - That sounds nice.

192
00:08:10,263 --> 00:08:11,663
-That's nice. - Yeah.

193
00:08:11,664 --> 00:08:13,764
Boring. I want to see something de-creepy.

194
00:08:15,164 --> 00:08:17,265
A change in the family dynamics

195
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,765
It can effect a lot of things.

196
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:21,370
It is normal.

197
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,670
I just wanted to check with you,

198
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,830
Make sure you guys are talking,

199
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,140
And finding a way to adjust to the new situation.

200
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,140
The way I see this, it's a great opportunity

201
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,880
For the two of you to maybe help each other through this.

202
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,050
Grow closer because of it.

203
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,350
Would either of you like to say anything?

204
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,420
Uh, well, just that Annie's a whore

205
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,290
Who went out with my boyfriend behind my back

206
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,560
- Your ex.  -After I asked her not to.

207
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,730
Oh, 'cause that really justifies

208
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,160
You ruining my birthday party

209
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,260
And trying to sleep with Jason.

210
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,300
Oh, my god, I wouldn't try

211
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,030
Unless if he was the last man on earth...

212
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,870
Okay, okay.

213
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,340
Okay, girls, uh, that's enough of that.

214
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,440
Look, ladies, I just don't want you

215
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:12,110
To waste your lives worrying and fighting about guys.

216
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,550
I mean, don't get me wrong.

217
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,420
Guys are good, guys are great,

218
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,990
But as you get older, you start to see

219
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,720
That having good girlfriends is what helps you survive.

220
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,590
God, if I could go back

221
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,430
And tell myself this, I would.

222
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,000
Girlfriends are so important.

223
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,470
Uh, girlfriends are like plants.

224
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,580
Yes, and guys

225
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,610
Are like cut flowers.

226
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,850
You know, sure, they're pretty

227
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,520
And, uh, they smell nice, most of the time,

228
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,220
But they don't last.

229
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,890
Yes, and a plant, or a friend,

230
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,890
If you nurture it and take care of it,

231
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,830
It grows and it lasts a long, long time.

232
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,970
Does this make sense?

233
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,570
Does... is this helping at all?

234
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,850
Are you doing a live blog about lunch?

235
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
Yes.

236
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,520
I am just keeping my public

237
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,920
Up to speed on what's going down.

238
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,990
Ugh, I'm thinking that cafeteria fish tacos

239
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,620
Was a questionable choice.

240
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,720
Who'd a thought?

241
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,330
Oh, check her out.

242
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,790
Are those ugg boots she's wearing?

243
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,700
I'm sorry, did I just travel back to 2002?

244
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,930
Oh, that is so going in.

245
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,570
Since when did you

246
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,700
Start caring about fashion?

247
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,240
So, where is the queen bee gonna sit

248
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,840
Now that the kingjock is no longer her main drone?

249
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,610
The jocks' table?

250
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,550
Okay, that's no longer an option.

251
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,020
The mathletes.

252
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,620
Uh, that would be puzzling.

253
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,920
Or, perhaps she'll join the drama kids

254
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,820
And do her best to act human.

255
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,660
Burn.

256
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,760
Glad I'm your friend.

257
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,500
The blendeds?

258
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,300
Bold move, Naomi.

259
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,270
But that hive doesn't always play nice with intruders.

260
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,240
Sometimes they get stung.

261
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,380
By all means, have a seat.

262
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,740
Thank you.

263
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,210
Yeah, um, we don't let sophomores sit with us.

264
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,050
I'm not your ordinary sophomore.

265
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,120
Well, you do accessorize well.

266
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,090
And I like the hair-- it's very julie christie.

267
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,360
Julie christie is my godmother.

268
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,760
We know, tasha.

269
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,900
I suppose you can hang with us for a while.

270
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,000
But we don't eat that garbage.

271
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,970
Yeah, we always have a blended, one at lunch

272
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,540
And one after school.

273
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,940
- Cool with me. - Cool, so,

274
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,470
Uh, you wouldn't mind getting them for us?

275
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,210
Unless that's a problem.

276
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,480
No, no. not a problem at all.

277
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,150
Great.

278
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,450
Oh, and do you think you could program my new sidekick for me?

279
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,620
I just got it, and I'm totally tech-challenged.

280
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,890
Well, fortun I speak fluent sidekick.

281
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,000
Come on, guys, full speed!

282
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,130
There's a big game tomorrow.

283
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,670
Hey, Sean, thanks for coming down.

284
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,930
Well, thanks for inviting me.

285
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,430
You know, it's interesting.

286
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,900
We, uh, we didn't play a lot of lacrosse

287
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,270
In south carolina, I'll tell you that.

288
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,440
Or in sadr city, for that matter.

289
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,880
- Sean... - Yeah?

290
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,450
25 years,that's a long time.

291
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,020
And... I don't know that I can ever...

292
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,960
I don't know that I can possibly make that up to you.

293
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,590
You didn't even know I existed.

294
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,830
Just seems like you haven't had the easiest life, and...

295
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,660
If I'd have known about you...

296
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,130
I would have been there and I would have helped.

297
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,540
That's nice.

298
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,240
But... I turned out okay.

299
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,710
Yeah, you did.

300
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,080
Yeah, you did.

301
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,380
Here I go, dad.

302
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,580
Check it out, showtime.

303
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,320
Whoo! Way to go,

304
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,020
Dixon! whoo!

305
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,430
Your dad say Mr. Matthews is coming back any time soon?

306
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,500
He didn't say, and... Okay, I know that he's innocent

307
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,340
And that that weird Kimberly girl was a cop and all,

308
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,810
But, I'm sorry, the fact that they just assigned us lolita...

309
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,270
Too on the nose.

310
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,980
I know, right! Like, come on, you're asking for...

311
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,980
I am so sorry, kansas.

312
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,580
I didn't see you way down there.

313
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,920
A tip for the short...

314
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,520
Wear heels.

315
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,490
I wouldn't know what to advise about the face.

316
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,060
Okay, you know what?

317
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,760
Well, take your time, honey.

318
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,400
You can text me with a comeback.

319
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,600
Look who's here-- the sophomore

320
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,570
Let it go, annie, let it go.

321
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,470
I programmed it,

322
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,810
Customized it and downloaded

323
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,580
The Estelle ringtone. perfect.

324
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,010
So, tell me, ladies,

325
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,980
How is this fairytale progressing?

326
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,750
Am I done with my little tasks?

327
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,520
Pretty much. just one more thing.

328
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,450
You know the restaurant, the Desiderata?

329
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,120
Oh. Ozzie Cardoza's family's place?

330
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,320
Damn, girl.

331
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,460
You're hooked up.

332
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,460
Well...

333
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,760
I'm not your typical sophomore.

334
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,430
Well, they claim to be totally booked,

335
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,630
But um, since you're so connected...

336
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,270
Yeah.

337
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,940
Done. no problem.

338
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,440
She's pretty good.

339
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,740
Yeah, but, um...

340
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:38,870
Where are our drinks?

341
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,880
Oh... right on time.

342
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,650
Thank you, penelope.

343
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,290
She's really good.

344
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,290
Yeah.

345
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,690
Soy, ladies.

346
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,420
Annie?

347
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,630
No.

348
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,230
No. do not engage the scary blonde chick.

349
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,330
Do not engage her. stop. don't. don't.

350
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,800
I have to. I have to, don't you go over there.

351
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,200
And I'll be right back. don't do it.

352
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,740
So, your housekeeper seems really nice.

353
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,440
Is you dad doing her, too?

354
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,310
Oh... um...

355
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,340
Wow.

356
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,110
Uno momento.

357
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,850
Ooh, the virgin's getting vicious.

358
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,410
Oh...

359
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,820
Clearly, trying to be me is giving you a nervous breakdown.

360
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,520
Oh, I do not want to be you.

361
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,390
Oh. now, sure you do.

362
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,890
Don't touch me!

363
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,860
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

364
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,200
Enjoy my sloppy seconds.

365
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,830
That girl is such a spaz.

366
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,840
What was that?

367
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,240
What's happened to you?

368
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,930
Ozzie?

369
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,630
Um...

370
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:02,170
Listen, I feel like we kind of started off on the wrong foot.

371
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,710
I've been a real game player lately. I'm sorry.

372
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,840
Look at you with your tail between your legs.

373
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,510
All right, bonita. what do you need?

374
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,020
Reservations for four at desiderata tonight?

375
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,220
Sure.

376
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,380
Really?

377
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,220
That's it?

378
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,020
Yeah. I gotta go, though.

379
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,860
Gotta go tell my tia in tj to go buy herself a parka.

380
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,640
Hey.

381
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,140
Hi. you were incredible.

382
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,440
That was amazing.

383
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,510
Thanks. I cannot believe that you came.

384
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,910
That's really sweet.

385
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,710
Well, it was part of my new year's resolution

386
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,340
To see more theater.

387
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,580
I was doing pretty good until I saw the blue man group

388
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,180
While I was taking cough medicine.

389
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,280
Hideous nightmares for weeks.

390
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,550
Well, the blue men are weird--

391
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,790
Very bald, very blue, so...

392
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,250
Oh, it's all coming back to me.

393
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,660
Yeah, that, and the fact that, um,

394
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,730
You haven't returned any of my phone calls.

395
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,730
Yeah, I'm sorry. it's just, this play is really intense

396
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,930
And then I've been kind of busy, so...

397
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,230
Do you want to have lunch?

398
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,730
Lunch? yeah.

399
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,740
I know you actresses like to stay skinny,

400
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,940
But you gotta eat, right?

401
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,370
Uh, well, I mean...

402
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,510
I have matinees most days, so...

403
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,540
Okay, how about tomorrow?

404
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,340
Are you free tomorrow?

405
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,550
Tomorrow?

406
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,010
Yeah. tomorrow I'm free.

407
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,350
Good.

408
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,750
Oh, this is for you.

409
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,690
Oh, thanks.

410
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,220
Thank you.

411
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,090
Didn't this come out of your office?

412
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:36,730
Well! look who went and got herself a haircut.

413
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:40,370
Your daughter turns 16 and it's time to shear the locks, huh?

414
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,700
What's on your mind, tabitha?

415
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,340
So...

416
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,740
I hear harry's going to dinner

417
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,210
With sean and tracy and you have chosen

418
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,180
Not to join them?

419
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,410
That's right.

420
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,120
Are you upset about the return of the prodigal son?

421
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,920
No, I'm not.

422
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,990
Sean is harry's son, not mine.

423
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,330
I'm trying to give harry space to do this.

424
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,930
Did I ever tell you about jean-luc and the chihuahua?

425
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,040
Jean-luc was a lover of mine.

426
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,270
Marvelous man.

427
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,110
Marvelous fingers.

428
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,380
Long...

429
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,950
Delicate...

430
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,010
Sensitive...

431
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,350
And double-jointed.

432
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,350
Sounds like a wonderful relationship.

433
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,990
Oh, it was.

434
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,990
We could have enjoyed each other for years,

435
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,090
Jean-luc and i.

436
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,860
If it wasn't for his chihuahua.

437
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,590
Ah, yes. the chihuahua.

438
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,060
Monstrous creature.

439
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,060
Giant eyes, giant ears,

440
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,970
The body of a rat and the bark of a demon.

441
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,300
But jean-luc adored the flea-bitten mongrel.

442
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,340
Let it sleep on the bed.

443
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,970
Oh... finally, one night I had enough.

444
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,910
"the dog has got to go," I said.

445
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,680
"the dog has got to go."

446
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,880
And you know what happened?

447
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,280
I couldn't begin to guess.

448
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,350
The dog went.

449
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,520
And so did jean-luc.

450
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,560
What I hadn't realized was

451
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,360
That his chihuahua was my chihuahua.

452
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,030
What was important to him

453
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,060
Should have been important to me.

454
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,570
You should go to that dinner.

455
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:24,570
Sean may be harry's son, but harry is your husband.

456
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,740
He can't do this without you.

457
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,650
O...kay.

458
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,330
Isn't the whole point of a reservation

459
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,000
Not having to wait?

460
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,130
I'll go see what the holdup is.

461
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,770
Excuse.

462
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,110
Ozzie. hi.

463
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,270
Is the table ready?

464
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,040
What name is it under?

465
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,250
Oh, you lowdown, dirty, rotten, game-playing...

466
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,880
Oh, who? me?

467
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,850
Yes, you.

468
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,490
You promised me a table.

469
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,420
Oh, no. that must have been my identical twin.

470
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,160
No, you promised me a table and I need that table right...

471
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,630
Right now.

472
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,030
God, you are so sexy when you are having a panic attack.

473
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,400
It's something about the way your cheeks flush.

474
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,710
You know, I do have a table.

475
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,610
It happens to be the best table

476
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,180
In the house, as a matter of fact.

477
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,450
Well, then, give me the table.

478
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,010
Okay.

479
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,780
You can have it, but you're gonna owe me.

480
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,650
Owe you what?

481
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,950
Do you want the table or not?

482
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,620
Fine. whatever. okay.

483
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,990
I owe you.

484
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,660
Good. right this way.

485
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,530
Come on.

486
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,260
Finally.

487
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,430
Apparently it's the best table in the house.

488
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,030
I want to thank the pep club for the spirit dinner.

489
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,640
And I'd like to thank you

490
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,370
For letting me fill in as your head coach.

491
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,910
It's been an honor, and a pleasure,

492
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,770
To watch you gentlemen grow.

493
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,510
Congratulations on every win that got you here,

494
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,150
And let's cap it off with another one tomorrow.

495
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,480
Good luck!

496
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,680
See you on the field!

497
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,820
Yeah!

498
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,590
Destroy bel air!

499
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,060
Destroy bel air! destroy bel air! destroy bel air!

500
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,760
Destroy bel air! destroy bel air!

501
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,470
So, the man with the fancy moves.

502
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,200
I'm glad you noticed.

503
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,310
I mean, you stand out.

504
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,340
I think it's cool what you're doing.

505
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,010
Thanks.

506
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,380
You're the first brother at west beverly to play varsity lacrosse

507
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,450
As long as anyone can remember.

508
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,750
That's tight.

509
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,620
You're our very own jackie robinson.

510
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,750
Uh... nah, nah.

511
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,060
Uh... I'm...

512
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,620
Just playing lacrosse because of my dad.

513
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,190
You mean principal wilson?

514
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,090
Who else would I mean?

515
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,300
Of course. hey, chill.

516
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,530
No, uh...

517
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,400
Guess I just been a little stressed out

518
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,370
With all the research I've been doing, you know?

519
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,470
Mmm, research?

520
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,970
Yeah, you know, I'm... I'm trying to find

521
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,640
The cure for the common cold,

522
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,140
And, uh, global warming.

523
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,380
Impressive.

524
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,720
You know, it turns out, chicken soup is the cure for both.

525
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,720
How about that?

526
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,550
Hey, dixon, I'm going to take off.

527
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,060
Really?

528
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,760
Yeah, sean showed up early.

529
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,530
Thought I'd show him around town

530
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,130
Before we go and pick up mom for dinner.

531
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,560
Yeah. okay.

532
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,230
Sure.

533
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,800
My dad.

534
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,470
I see.

535
00:22:52,942 --> 00:22:55,242
we have to have a drink at hotel , welter

536
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:58,904
Oh I am poul alone because you are just so much to bent in before you leave

537
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:01,513
Now that I was thinking on Sunday that we would go to the desert hot spring

538
00:23:01,557 --> 00:23:02,757
because you haven't had watsu

539
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:05,469
to have watsu at two bunch balls

540
00:23:05,892 --> 00:23:06,892
wa  wasu?

541
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:10,193
is that...  is that kind of sushi?

542
00:23:11,738 --> 00:23:12,738
hah  aren't you adorable?

543
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,100
It's water shiatsu.

544
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,710
Watsu.

545
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,070
But speaking of sushi,

546
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,570
Lunch tomomorrow, r-23?

547
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,780
We've already been to katsuya, matsuhisa

548
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,510
And nobu...

549
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,180
I've been eating a lot of raw fish.

550
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,550
You know, actually, sean, I was hoping

551
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,520
That you could come to the lacrosse game tomorrow.

552
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,220
Yeah, that'd be great.

553
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,490
Really?

554
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,390
You're going to take your son

555
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,290
To a high school sporting event?

556
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,330
I mean, that's what you have to offer him?

557
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,530
Sean, you should come stay with us for a while.

558
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:48,700
Really?

559
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,670
Yeah, absolutely.

560
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,970
We're your family, too.

561
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,610
I mean, we're not fancy.

562
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,110
We can't offer you tuna sashimi,

563
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,410
But I make a mean

564
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,410
Tuna casserole.

565
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,710
Sounds good.

566
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,750
And, hey, I've seen where you live.

567
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,420
It seems plenty fancy to me.

568
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,950
Oh, that's his mother's money, not his.

569
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,790
I just had a flashback

570
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,930
To you going all raging bull on naomi.

571
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,800
It was amazing.

572
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,930
Silver, stop.

573
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,630
Sorry. sorry.

574
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,940
Okay, you do know we're going to be sitting

575
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,370
On cold metal bleachers, right?

576
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,040
Too short?

577
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,480
Um, let's just say your going to need two hairdo's

578
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,480
For that outfit.

579
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,780
God, why do I suddenly hate all of my clothes?

580
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,010
Aw, your face--

581
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,320
It was priceless.

582
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,150
You were just like...

583
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,990
Wait, have you ever seen the De kooning painting, woman?

584
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,120
No.

585
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,760
Because your face looked exactly like it.

586
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,490
Um, it was all...

587
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,030
Hey, um...

588
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:57,240
Have I changed?

589
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,140
Yes, like 17 times.

590
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,740
No, I mean...

591
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,950
I mean in... the larger sense.

592
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:08,180
I've been calling naomi bad, bad names

593
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,320
And I've been dissing her clothes.

594
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,720
I've been shoving her.

595
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,650
I kind of like the wild child side of you.

596
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,290
Oh, come on.

597
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,630
You're not acting any worse than she is.

598
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:23,660
No, um... but I'm not acting any better either.

599
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,730
I swear, this is not me.

600
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,100
Okay.

601
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,370
So who are you?

602
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,340
I used to a be nice person.

603
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:39,080
I was a little geeky.

604
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,620
I didn't... I didn't used to care so much

605
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,390
About what clothes I wore.

606
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,450
Especially to a lacrosse game.

607
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,990
I didn't give a crap what people thought about me.

608
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,890
I want to be that person again.

609
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:57,000
Nobody's stopping you.

610
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,070
That is very true.

611
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,280
All right, guys, come on bring it in.

612
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,710
Last time we played them, their middies were slow.

613
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,180
Ethan, with your wheels, you should get a lot of looks.

614
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,150
Dixon, I want you to hit him at the top of the triangle.

615
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:18,950
Hey, dad, you know what I was thinking...

616
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,720
Go, wildcats!

617
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,190
Hey, sean, you made it.

618
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,020
Never too late to learn the game.

619
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,830
You want to hang out on the sidelines a bit? sure.

620
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,530
All right. everybody, this is sean--

621
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,200
Nice to meet y'all.

622
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,570
Hey, man. all right, come on team, let's bring it!

623
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,900
Get psyched!

624
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,740
Go... wildcats!

625
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:38,070
Go! go! go! come on! all right, come on.

626
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
I want you two to stand over here next to me.

627
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,390
So how are you?

628
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,320
I'm really good.

629
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,720
I'm sorry I didn't call you back.

630
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,820
It's just... with the play I've been busy.

631
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,330
Honestly, I haven't called anybody back.

632
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,500
No, that's fine. I get it.

633
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,760
It's just, I was getting kind of used

634
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,300
To having you around again.

635
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,970
It's fun hanging out with you.

636
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,670
Yeah, but things are different now.

637
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,000
You know, people grow up, the move on,

638
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,770
They live their own lives.

639
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:14,440
It's not like we're in high school anymore.

640
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,280
Right.

641
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,180
What does that mean exactly?

642
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:21,750
I'm not trying to hurt your feelings,

643
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,690
Honestly, it's the last thing I want to do, but...

644
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,720
What do we have in common anymore?

645
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:35,000
It kind of sounds like you're breaking up with me.

646
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,800
No, I just...

647
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,770
I don't want to fight over dylan or ryan

648
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,540
Or whoever.

649
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:45,140
You know, I'm over all of that drama.

650
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,970
It's just that we have so much history.

651
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,740
I guess I just figured...

652
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,680
Yeah, I guess I don't see history

653
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,950
As a good enough reason to keep going on this way.

654
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,520
Especially when we haven't learned anything

655
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,680
From that history.

656
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,460
You know what, I'm kind of hungry.

657
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,820
I'm going to order.

658
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,560
You can go live your life.

659
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,440
Hey, surprise, surprise.

660
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,370
What are you gals doing here?

661
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,270
I'm sure I'll be asking myself the same thing 20 minutes from now.

662
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,770
You kidding me?

663
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,640
There's nothing I like more than a sporting event.

664
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,110
I got a book I got an ipod,

665
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,350
I even have a rubik's cube.

666
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,810
Yeah, of course you do.

667
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,280
And a friend here, largely against her will.

668
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,520
And that.

669
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,380
Hey, I'm here. I'm being a good girlfriend.

670
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,950
Yeah, speaking of good girlfriends,

671
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,210
Do you guys know if annie's going to show up?

672
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,560
Yeah, I think, um...

673
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,860
Oh, my god, that hot dog smells so disgusting.

674
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,460
I think...

675
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,770
Oh, and then there's that.

676
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,470
she's probably going to make an appearance later

677
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,200
So I'm going to go deal with that

678
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,010
Hey, naomi.

679
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,280
How was dinner?

680
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:16,180
Uh, well, I suppose it was palatable enough.

681
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,320
I give it three and quarter stars.

682
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,390
I just can't win with you.

683
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,220
Oh, wait, yes, I can.

684
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,890
You owe me.

685
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,390
What do you want?

686
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,090
I want a kiss.

687
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,230
Fine.

688
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,070
That was generous,

689
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,740
But I didn't mean me.

690
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,880
I want you to kiss walter the wildcat.

691
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,050
What?!

692
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,750
Really?

693
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,120
Is it fun for you? ah... yeah.

694
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,390
Great, okay, fine.Excuse me

695
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,130
while I go kiss a mangy stuffed cat

696
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,930
To satisfy your furry fetish.

697
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,900
Could you stop moving for one second?

698
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,980
What...?

699
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,380
Oh, my god, it's you?

700
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,980
You're a freak.

701
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:24,680
- Oh, you're pathetic.  - oh, whatever.

702
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,990
Annie, what the...?

703
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,270
Hey, so how's it going with naomi?

704
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,170
Yeah, well, I don't know.

705
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,370
I'm not quite sure how to nurture

706
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,670
This particular plant.

707
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,140
I hear you.

708
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:49,280
Oh, excuse me.

709
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:54,310
Hello.  Yes.  Oh,my God

710
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,880
Okay, I'll be right there.

711
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,300
Come on, dixon, what are you doing?

712
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,330
There you go, pass it. pass it.

713
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,060
Come on, dixon, pass it! watch that break.

714
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,370
Hey, I'm open!

715
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,270
Pass the ball, dixon!

716
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,700
What are you doing?!

717
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,680
Let me get a time out. come on, guys!

718
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,420
Hey, deep breath.

719
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,780
Let's regroup, all right?

720
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,320
Dixon...You need to clean up your act.

721
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,020
We got these guys on skill,

722
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,860
All right? no need to panic.

723
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:39,460
We got these guys on skill, dixon. let's go.

724
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:43,130
All right, everybody back out on the field, let's go.

725
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,760
Come on, dix.

726
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,810
Hey! dix, what's the matter with you?!

727
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,250
Oh, come on.

728
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,210
Dave, come on.

729
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,120
You're in for dixon.

730
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,080
Dixon, you're out!

731
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,160
Hey, the way you're playing is unacceptable.

732
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,430
Screw you, man.

733
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,490
- What'd you say?  - screw... you.

734
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,130
What was that out there?

735
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,030
You've got to learn to control your anger.

736
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,670
When we're on the field together,

737
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,300
I'm your coach, not your dad.

738
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,500
No kidding.

739
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,540
You've been so busy being sean's dad.

740
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:45,880
- Sean?  - Yeah, sean... your real son.

741
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:54,590
I'm sorry.

742
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,630
I thought that you were okay with him.

743
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:05,200
Just ever since he's been here, it's been a 24/7 seanfest.

744
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:09,540
You take him to practice, you ditched the spirit dinner.

745
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,810
Can't let that guy

746
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,640
Out of your sight.

747
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,560
I guess...

748
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:36,300
It was so sudden, him showing up here.

749
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:40,340
I...I got blindsided

750
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,370
And didn't know how to handle it.

751
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,810
I'm sorry.

752
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:49,210
You are my son,

753
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,680
And genes, biology, none of that stuff matters.

754
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,620
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?

755
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:54,780
Of course it matters.

756
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,280
No, it doesn't.

757
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,820
Yeah? then why have you been acting the way you do?!

758
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,990
Why does this even matter?!

759
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,930
Why do you even care?!

760
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,400
Without your genes, sean is just a total stranger.

761
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,600
It does matter.

762
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:16,200
Like, who you are, who you're related to.

763
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,640
It matters... to me.

764
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,110
Like, when you're with sean,

765
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:29,920
It makes you feel connected to who you are, right?

766
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,560
Well, I want that for myself.

767
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:40,800
Who I am is black.

768
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:48,500
When we adopted you, people kept asking questions,

769
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,010
Very well-meant.

770
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,980
how's he gonna know where he's from?

771
00:34:55,010 --> 00:35:00,250
how are you gonna teach him about his heritage?

772
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,920
How are you gonna teach him how to shave his black hair?

773
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,420
You know what I told those people?

774
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,460
i don't know.

775
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:17,030
But when the time comes, we will figure it out.

776
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:21,200
Maybe the time has come to figure it out.

777
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,520
The ball! get the ball!

778
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,150
Get him!

779
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,710
Hey, good job.

780
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,640
That was hot.

781
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:06,350
Hey, you big athletic manly sports stud!

782
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,620
Thank you, thank you.

783
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:08,920
Did you watch the game?

784
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,320
I was mostly rubik's cubing.

785
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:13,460
Um, who, who is that?

786
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,790
You know, just a cheerleader.

787
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,830
Uh, anyway, you know, I'm glad you came.

788
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,630
Maybe next year you'll actually watch me play.

789
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,800
Oh, so you think

790
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,800
We're gonna be together next year.

791
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,770
Why not?

792
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,770
Why not?

793
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:34,010
Oh, my god, you actually won!

794
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,040
I can't believe it!

795
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,350
And I can't believe that you were walter the wildcat.

796
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,720
You have some zany moves.

797
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:43,050
Well, Jared actually got concussed at the spirit dinner,

798
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,550
And I thought I'd take his place.

799
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,120
Why not?

800
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:49,190
Look, I'm not naomi.

801
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,790
I'm not bitchy and slick.

802
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:55,300
I don't read w magazine and I really have no idea

803
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,530
How many kids brad and angelina have right now.

804
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:02,700
I'm not mean and I'm not cool.

805
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,680
But this... this is me.

806
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:11,050
I like this you.

807
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,320
- Yeah?  - yeah.

808
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,380
Especially your tail!

809
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:26,060
So, uh, what was the deal with you and the creepy mascot?

810
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,860
Oh, that was...

811
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,230
Really bizarre?

812
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,970
Look, you wanted a table at desiderata,

813
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,540
I got the table, okay?

814
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:40,980
In order to get that table, I had to kiss the mascot.

815
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,350
I did what I had to do.

816
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,650
You kissed the masscut for a table?

817
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,050
Hardcore.

818
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,820
I like it.

819
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,590
I think this could be the beginning

820
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,060
Of a beautiful friendship.

821
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,890
Friendship of the beautiful.

822
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,600
Hey, uh, sean.

823
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:05,070
Hey, uh, listen, I'm sorry if me being here

824
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,000
Has been kind of a drag, you know?

825
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,470
It's selfish of me just to show up like this.

826
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,240
Ah, no, man, you're cool, for real.

827
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,610
No, no, it was selfish.

828
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,210
Yeah, my father, adopted father,

829
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,110
He, uh, he just passed away.

830
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,250
For real, man? I'm sorry.

831
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,520
Yeah, well, he was kind of jerk, my dad.

832
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:22,350
You know, he spent more time playing video poker

833
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,450
Than he did trying to raise me.

834
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:28,760
I guess all I'm saying is you're lucky.

835
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:29,930
I know.

836
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,290
Anyway, I'm sorry.

837
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:32,530
Congrats on the game, huh?

838
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,860
I'll see you around.

839
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,760
Hey, uh, you're not gonna go out with us?

840
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,600
I mean, we're all going to celebrate.

841
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,900
Uh, I think I've overstayed my welcome.

842
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:44,270
Nah, man, my dad wants you here.

843
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,810
I mean, we all want you here.

844
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,740
Really?

845
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,380
Yeah, really.

846
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:51,510
- Come on, man.  - all right.

847
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,150
Well, according to your emergency contact list,

848
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,620
We're still bffs.

849
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,620
Well, if they called you, I'm sorry.

850
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,360
Don't be. I was worried about you.

851
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,690
What happened?

852
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:07,600
I fell off the stage in a blackout.

853
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,370
It's a cursed play,

854
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,240
And you're never actually supposed to say its name.

855
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,070
It's an old superstition.

856
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,470
And I accidentally said it,

857
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,170
And then I didn't do the stupid ritual

858
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,340
That you're supposed to say when you do say it,

859
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:23,050
And so here I am.

860
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,780
You know, I heard it was the same situation for the cast

861
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,250
Of saved by the bell?

862
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,920
I can't believe that you still came here

863
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,650
After everything that I said.

864
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,260
I came because we're friends, no matter what you say.

865
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,930
And our history means something to me

866
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,330
Whether you want to acknowledge it or not.

867
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,770
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

868
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,140
I'm sorry about everything that I said.

869
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,810
Don't be. you were being honest.

870
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,210
No, I wasn't.

871
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,910
I was actually avoiding being honest.

872
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,380
What do you mean?

873
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,050
I was trying to push you away.

874
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:04,350
Why?

875
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:08,120
Because I slept with ryan.

876
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,180
Thanks, y'all.

877
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,650
No problem, man.

878
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:36,990
I always wanted longer arms.

879
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,420
All right. all right, man

880
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,860
Good night. good night, honey.

881
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,820
Hey. hey, night, bud.

882
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,030
Good night, mom.

883
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,030
Good night.

884
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,060
Night, daddy.

885
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,460
Good night, man.

886
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,930
- Night, sean.  - good night.

887
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,700
I appreciate you opening up your home to me.

888
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,940
Hey, it's our pleasure. we're happy to have you here.

889
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:59,710
Absolutely. make yourself comfortable.

890
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,540
First door on the left.

891
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,680
It's that way, yeah.

892
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,410
Left, yeah.

893
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,120
I want to thank you

894
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,550
For being so great about all this.

895
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,950
Its tricky.

896
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:16,560
your chihuahua is my chihuahua.

897
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,660
What?

898
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,060
Your family is my family.

899
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,830
Okay.

900
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,640
Hey. it's all good.

901
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,810
Everything's cool here.

902
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,480
I'm making myself right at home.
