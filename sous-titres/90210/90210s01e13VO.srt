1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,960
I'm not your ordinary sophomore

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,930
- Hey, girlfriend  - yes, boyfriend?

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,999
Nothing, nothing. I just like saying that

4
00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:10,860
I like hearing it.

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,260
I'm going to lose everything!

6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,660
no, no, you're not. give it to me.

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,860
I can help you deal with this, but you got to let me.

8
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,700
Look at this. I need you to tell them that the drugs were yours.

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,330
If she confesses it should help,

10
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,560
But you know there's no guarantees.

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,830
Adrianna's going to be here.

12
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,560
If you'll just give her a few more minutes.

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,030
I cannot believe you did this to me.

14
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,430
You were the one person that I thought I could count on,

15
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,560
That I could trust.

16
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,700
Glad that you're okay, I really am,

17
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,060
But I can't keep watching you do this to yourself,

18
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,890
Not anymore.

19
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,210
- I'm a virgin.  - what?

20
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,700
- When we ran your blood work,it turns out you're pregnant.  - no.

21
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,760
What's navid going to think?

22
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,300
He's going to hate me.

23
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,100
Oh, my friends back home are so going to get a snow day.

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,530
Those lucky bastards.

25
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,430
back home, huh?

26
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,760
Back in kansas, I mean.

27
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,830
Hey, home is where the heart is, annie.

28
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,160
So there's a blizzard in kansas.

29
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,130
And a heat wave in l.a.

30
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,900
Seriously, I'm wearing, like, practically nothing.

31
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,400
What kind of nothing?

32
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,600
Just a black negligee.

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,560
A negligee?

34
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,200
It's black. it's sort of sheer.

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,460
Sort of...

36
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,960
Hello?

37
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,900
I'm on the phone!

38
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,630
And you shouldn't be.

39
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,830
It's late, annie. time to hang up.

40
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,900
Good night, ethan.

41
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,830
Good night, mrs. wilson.

42
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,360
Time to hang up, annie.

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,560
Fine!

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,400
Annie, charge your cell next time.

45
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,000
I better go.

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,460
Good night.

47
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,460
- Sweet dreams.  - sweet dreams.

48
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,500
- Annie  - Yeah?

49
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,260
I love you.

50
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,930
I love you, too.

51
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,830
Don't shoot till you see the whites of their eyes.

52
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,360
Come, children, give me your muskets to clean.

53
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,230
Um, it says, "now come, children,

54
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,660
Give grandmother your muskets to clean."

55
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,560
I made a teensy adjustment.

56
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,160
I'm just not sure I'm plausible as a grandmother.

57
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,960
Yeah, well, it's a miniseries

58
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,730
About a 70-something revolutionary war hero

59
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,500
Who knits in her spare time.

60
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,300
not so sure plausibly is top pirority

61
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,960
Come, children, give grandmother your muskets to clean.

62
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,500
Here is my musket.

63
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,360
I do hope she shoots straight.

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,830
Ooh. the ac was off.

65
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,630
I want it off.

66
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,160
It's better for my vocal chords.

67
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,530
It's nearly 90 degrees in here.

68
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,660
Aren't you sweltering?

69
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,200
It is hot.

70
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,300
These vocal chords are what put this roof over our heads.

71
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,830
Okay, guys,

72
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,500
It's almost time for school.

73
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,830
And I happened to notice

74
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,130
That the trash hasn't gone out

75
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,900
And the dishwasher hasn't been emptied.

76
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,500
They're helping me rehearse red coats and blue bloods.

77
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,660
Yeah, grandma, has an audition.

78
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,200
And you have chores.

79
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,560
Oh, please, I pay the help to do those things.

80
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,160
There's no need.

81
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,200
There is a need.

82
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,830
They're kids.

83
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,160
They have chores so they'll learn...

84
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,300
What? how to take out the trash?

85
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,560
Is that really what you want Your children learning?

86
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,660
Harry...

87
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,300
What?

88
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,300
Fine. I'll do the chores.

89
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,430
The maid will do the chores.

90
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,900
Um, you know what?

91
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,160
We'll do the chores.

92
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,000
Yep, here we go, cleaning up.

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,260
Oh, hey, can I have the car this afternoon?

94
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,760
I want to do something with ethan. no can do.

95
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,060
no can do.Got something to do this afternoon.

96
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,300
What?

97
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,230
An extracurricular activity.

98
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,930
Okay, fine, then you can do the chores.

99
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,030
Break a leg today, grandma.

100
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,660
Thanks, sweetie.

101
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,230
- Yeah, break a leg  - thank you.

102
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,700
Absolutely...

103
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,460
Break a leg.

104
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,760
You have a nice mouth.

105
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,560
I'm glad you like it.

106
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,230
Look, all I'm saying is maybe it's not

107
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,560
The end of the world.

108
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,460
I'm sorry, my optimistic friend,

109
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,500
But the santa ana winds do not blow in january.

110
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,060
What we're dealing with here, is global warming, i.e.

111
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,160
The end of the world as we know it, i.e. the apocalypse.

112
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,260
Come on, silver. the apocalypse?

113
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,800
I'm not kidding.

114
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,860
Look, one of the seven signs.

115
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,160
Excessive p.d.a.

116
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,660
Hi, guys.

117
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,860
Check revelations, babe.

118
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,630
So what's up, guys?

119
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,260
I actually got to run.

120
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,460
I got to grab a book from the library before class.

121
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,530
Bye, honey.

122
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,060
Bye, baby.

123
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,930
Actually, I'm gonna take off, too.

124
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,730
Unless you need some help.

125
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,860
No, I'm fine.

126
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,900
I love you.

127
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,960
I love you, too.

128
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,660
Bye, guys.

129
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,930
Later, guys.

130
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,460
See ya, man.

131
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,360
The phrase "gag me" comes to mind.

132
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,300
Why? they're happy.

133
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,460
They're giving me diabetes.

134
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,800
All, "i love you." "i love you."

135
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,460
"i love you, snookums." "i love you, boo boo."

136
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,900
Please.

137
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,400
Never before did a blaze lighting test have such a beautiful subject.

138
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,130
You're glowing.

139
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,860
Glowing? I'm not glowing.

140
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,030
Yeah, you are.

141
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,460
No, there's no glow Emanating from over here.

142
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,930
Trust me.

143
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,300
Is everything all right?

144
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,500
Are you happy?

145
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,200
Like, I mean, with us?

146
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,730
Seriously, I've never been happier,

147
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,800
With us or with anything else.

148
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,530
I wouldn't change a thing.

149
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,930
So you don't want things to change?

150
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,230
Hell, no.

151
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,730
I mean, I love me some barack obama,

152
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,300
But in this case, change is bad.

153
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,900
This... you and me...

154
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,230
Us, everything

155
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,060
Is just exactly right.

156
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,030
Seriously, I'm really happy,

157
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,030
Adrianna.

158
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,030
Yeah, me, too.

159
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,460
All right, I want to see some hustle

160
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,460
Really!

161
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,430
With all due respect, it's a hundred degrees out.

162
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,900
It's not exactly hustling weather.

163
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,360
Use the heat, girls, use the heat.

164
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,360
Oh, my god.

165
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,830
You two, what do you want?

166
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,760
I have my period.

167
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,130
I'm bleeding like A stuck pig

168
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,560
I need to see the nurse.

169
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,100
And you, adrianna, are you also menstruating?

170
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,400
No, I'm not, but I have a really bad headache.

171
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,900
Maybe field hockey would help.

172
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,530
And maybe she gets a migraine,

173
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,430
Falls on her field hockey stick and-- --

174
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,530
Oh, no, impales herself.

175
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,000
Are you prepared to deal with a lawsuit?

176
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,160
Fine, go.

177
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,760
But I'm warning you, ms. clark,

178
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,060
I'm gonna start keeping track Of your menstrual cycle.

179
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,760
Oh, well, that's pathetic.

180
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,030
Thanks.

181
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,960
Hey, boys.

182
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,300
Oh, my god!

183
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,860
The ac must be busted.

184
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,500
I knew I should have gone to crossroads.

185
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,060
This is such a crock.

186
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,560
So, how have you been?

187
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,700
I feel like I haven't seen you in ages.

188
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,860
I know. you've been hanging out with your new friends

189
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,060
And I've just been busy.

190
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,930
What's been going on? What are you up to?

191
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,830
Do you want to have dinner sometime?

192
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,160
Sure, yeah, of course.

193
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,830
I mean, you don't have to if you don't want to.

194
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,630
I just, um...

195
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,400
I'm, uh...

196
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,500
I'm going through something,

197
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,000
And I thought I knew how to handle it, but I don't.

198
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,930
And I just, i... I really need someone to talk to.

199
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,800
In private.

200
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,230
You're going through something?

201
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,560
Yeah, we'll do dinner.

202
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,930
Naomi.

203
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,500
Um, actually I have to go, so I'll see you later.

204
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,000
Hey, guys, what's up?

205
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,060
The heat totally melted my drink.

206
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,330
It tastes like coffee. ugh.

207
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,230
It is coffee, tasha.

208
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,300
What's wrong, naomi?

209
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,930
Nothing. it's just...

210
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,930
You guys know my old friend adrianna?

211
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,430
Yeah. the druggie-- sorry, ex-druggie now.

212
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,860
I think she's using again.

213
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,330
Well, what can you do?

214
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,760
You already tried to help her once, right?

215
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,300
I just don't know how I'm supposed to be

216
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,000
You're not, naomi.

217
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,030
I mean, I know you're upset,

218
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,260
But she's not worth it.

219
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,130
God, it just pisses me off so much!

220
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,430
What's with her?

221
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,460
I mean, why is she such a train wreck druggie?

222
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,460
I don't know

223
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,460
But I know she's not your problem.

224
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,100
And you add 20 of the sulfuric acid

225
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,630
Into to your beaker and heat until it's boiling.

226
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,800
Great job, Adrianna.

227
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,700
Bet adrianna would like to

228
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,600
Drop some of that sulfuric acid.

229
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,460
Yeah, good one.

230
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,530
Oh, my god!

231
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,700
Everyone stay in your seats.

232
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,400
Adrianna? adrianna, can you hear me?

233
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,960
Adrianna?

234
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,130
I can't believe this is happening again.

235
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,130
She's not your problem.

236
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,600
You're nice.

237
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,100
What are you two, in heat?

238
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,360
Hey, uh, how about a little privacy, silver?

239
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,400
Mm, how about a little discretion, ethan?

240
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,200
Annie, I need those keys.

241
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,360
Huh? oh, yeah.

242
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,300
Um, dixon has a mysterious

243
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,930
Extracurricular activity

244
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,700
That he doesn't want to talk about.

245
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,900
What? tell me.

246
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,360
It's no big deal.

247
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
I just joined the choir.

248
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,530
You're singing in the choir?

249
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,300
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

250
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,760
Uh, nothing.

251
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,960
Nothing. I mean, it's

252
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,260
An organized

253
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,230
School activity where nerds stand on risers

254
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,100
And sing an a Capella version of

255
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,000
"the lion sleeps tonight."

256
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,900
I mean, how cool can you get?

257
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,730
Am I right?

258
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,995
Is it true

259
00:10:35,995 --> 00:10:38,260
That the choirmaster's biggest credit

260
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,245
Is backup singer

261
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:40,230
In a pet-stain remover commercial?

262
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,700
'cause that's rad.

263
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,500
We can pretend it's just you and me.

264
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,630
Hello, west beverly.

265
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,800
And my dad.

266
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,660
We're in the middle of a heat wave,

267
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,710
And as you've probably noticed

268
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,760
The ac is broken.

269
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,260
Unfortunately, it won't be fixed

270
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,760
For at least another day.

271
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,730
Today's classes will continue as scheduled,

272
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,115
But-- and I know that

273
00:11:01,115 --> 00:11:02,500
This will disappoint you all--

274
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,700
School tomorrow is canceled.

275
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,100
Wha...?! yes!

276
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,930
Beach party!

277
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,700
Beach party!

278
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,130
Navid!

279
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,900
Well, there's no navid standing behind you,

280
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,960
Now is there, honey?

281
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,000
Okay, what's your problem?

282
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,130
I don't have a problem.

283
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,630
You do. your girlfriend's using again.

284
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,330
Using? drugs? no, I don't think so.

285
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,800
I'd know, wouldn't i?

286
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,760
She's not always my responsibility, navid.

287
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,600
Who said she was?

288
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,000
Get over yourself, naomi.

289
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,330
I really was hoping

290
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,860
That we could hang out alone.

291
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,660
I promised my brother.

292
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,060
Tomorrow, though, it's just you and me, girl.

293
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,630
And a beach full of classmates.

294
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,960
Mm, yeah, I did really,

295
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,530
Really just want to be alone with you.

296
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,330
Annie!

297
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,960
- Annie! - hi!

298
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,960
A-a car? a car with a bow?

299
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,860
A car with a bow for me?

300
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,760
For you and your brother. you like it?

301
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,460
Yes! I mean, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

302
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,430
- No. - okay, I get that

303
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,930
You don't want to give me

304
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,430
A car, but to take away a car,

305
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,130
A perfectly good car, just to prove a point?

306
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,230
Another car would be handy...

307
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,230
But you should've run it by us first.

308
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,130
I was pretty explicit

309
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,260
About this, tabitha.

310
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,960
I said, no car, and I meant no car.

311
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,260
You said no car for annie's birthday.

312
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,730
This is not a birthday car.

313
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,130
The kids got good grades

314
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,030
Last term, and they need a car.

315
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,230
Thank you, grandma.

316
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,830
She-she's right, okay? we do.

317
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,960
No, you don't need a car.

318
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,030
No 16-year-old

319
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,100
Needs a car.

320
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,360
There are kids

321
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,730
In other countries without shoes

322
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,430
And you think you need a car?

323
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,660
Okay, I want a car.

324
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,060
A car would useful.

325
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,100
I-i am grateful

326
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,400
For my shoes, but I would be

327
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,800
Very grateful for a car.

328
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,060
Daddy?

329
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,300
Deb?

330
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,230
Where are the keys?

331
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,960
The car is going back.

332
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,400
And I'm going

333
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,800
To take a nice icy cold bath.

334
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,760
Wow, whose car is that in the driveway?

335
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,760
Not ours

336
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,930
You know, I don't think

337
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,360
They did tai chi in colonial new england.

338
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,360
Your agita is messing with my chi, dear.

339
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,130
I'm sorry, but

340
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,360
You know what kind of sucks?

341
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,400
- What's that? - being a teenager.

342
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,780
Okay, it's like everything

343
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,160
Is in a conspiracy against you.

344
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,730
You're always being told

345
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,930
What you can do and where you have to be.

346
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,460
Nothing's in your control.

347
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,895
I mean, you can't have freedom

348
00:14:00,895 --> 00:14:02,330
And you can't have space,

349
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,795
But you can't get anywhere

350
00:14:03,795 --> 00:14:05,260
'Cause you can't have a car.

351
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,700
I'm sick of it.

352
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,230
I'm hot and I'm tired

353
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,760
And I'm tired of being a teenager.

354
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,230
I think you have a point.

355
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,900
I have something for you.

356
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,660
Keys. oh, grandma, we tried this.

357
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,400
These are not car keys.

358
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,830
They're keys to my palms springs getaway.

359
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,160
You need to get away.

360
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,530
Be by yourself.

361
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,300
Have some freedom, have some space.

362
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,000
Really? what better place

363
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,600
To chill out than the desert?

364
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,330
But my mother would...

365
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:38,860
I already asked her.

366
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,700
You're good to go.

367
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,260
Burger, club, double fries.

368
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,260
Someone's hungry.

369
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,630
Heat makes me hungry, bro.

370
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,645
Hey, you and silver

371
00:14:57,645 --> 00:14:58,660
Going to the beach later?

372
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,360
I don't know, man.

373
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,695
She may have plans

374
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:03,030
Already preparing for the apocalypse

375
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,960
With her "the end is nigh" sign.

376
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,560
Oh, do I detect trouble in paradise?

377
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,000
Nah, man.

378
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,730
You know, silver's a little much sometimes

379
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,660
With the whole negativity and moodiness.

380
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,130
Come on, man, that's part of her charm.

381
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,045
She has that whole dissenting- voice

382
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:17,960
Thing going on, you know?

383
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,660
She questions things.

384
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,930
It's who she is, it's what she does.

385
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,360
She mocks everything, man.

386
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,130
My sister said

387
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:23,900
"I love you" to her boyfriend,

388
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,460
She has a field day.

389
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,045
All right, you know what?

390
00:15:26,045 --> 00:15:26,630
Let me tell you something.

391
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,160
And this is drawing

392
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,030
From my vast experience with women, okay?

393
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,265
Why would silver mock annie and ethan's

394
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,500
"I love you's," huh?

395
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,700
Sour grapes, baby, sour grapes.

396
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,660
So you-you mean...

397
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,900
That chick loves you, man.

398
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,830
And she wants you to say it to her.

399
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,160
So say it to her.

400
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,230
You think?

401
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,960
Dude, I know. I'm outta here, bro.

402
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,430
I'll see you at the sea, bro.

403
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,500
Hey, man, where's my tip?!

404
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,265
I gave you a tip, my friend

405
00:15:54,265 --> 00:15:56,830
A big tip. sour grapes.

406
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,000
Sorry about that. my bad.

407
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,560
She turned up the heat!

408
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,600
Who did what?

409
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,260
Your mother-- she turned up the heat

410
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,030
For her precious vocal cords,

411
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,400
I'm sure. I've had it, harry!

412
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,730
I have had it!

413
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,915
Take it easy.

414
00:16:11,915 --> 00:16:13,100
We will turn the thermostat down.

415
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,760
Oh, I did, and you know what she did?

416
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,495
She turned it up!

417
00:16:15,495 --> 00:16:16,230
And you know what I did?

418
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,400
I turned it down.

419
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,300
And you know what she did?

420
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,200
she turned it up!

421
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,060
And you know what you did? nothing!

422
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,100
Absolutely nothing!

423
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,460
What am I supposed to do?!

424
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,430
You are my mother, she is my wife...

425
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:29,600
You are my wife, she is my mother.

426
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,930
You are two powerful women,

427
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,060
And I respect you both.

428
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,430
But we're the parents, you and i.

429
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,600
But we live under her roof.

430
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,630
Maybe we shouldn't.

431
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,765
I need you, harry.

432
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,230
I can't do this alone.

433
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,560
Deb, where are you going?!

434
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,730
To turn down the thermostat.

435
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,460
I shouldn't be here.

436
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,230
I don't want to...

437
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,600
I shouldn't care about you, ade.

438
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,600
How did you even know I was here?

439
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,465
Talked to your mom

440
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:16,330
Delightful creature that she is.

441
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,600
Said you were at the library,

442
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,730
So I figured...

443
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,760
You know me

444
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,230
Pretty well, I guess.

445
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,600
Yeah, I do.

446
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,630
And I also know you're using drugs again.

447
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,460
What? no!

448
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,160
You're gonna lie to me again?

449
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,930
Really? that's great. that's fabulous.

450
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,760
You know what? this was a stupid idea.

451
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,900
I'm gonna go.

452
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,030
I'm... I'm pregnant.

453
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,700
You're...?

454
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,160
I'm pregnant.

455
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,230
Pregnant pregnant?

456
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,630
Oh, honey.

457
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,360
Yeah, it's crazy, right?

458
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,530
So you fainted because you...

459
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,600
Because I feel like crap.

460
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,600
What are you gonna do?

461
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,200
I have no clue.

462
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,860
Who's the father?

463
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,545
I think this guy named hank

464
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:21,230
Who I know from rehab.

465
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,130
But I don't know really.

466
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,930
Are you okay?

467
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm scared.

468
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,460
Yeah.

469
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,700
Hey,

470
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,860
You want to go to palm springs?

471
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,200
Where?

472
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,930
Palm springs. I got the keys

473
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,230
To my grandma's house in palm springs.

474
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,960
Where we could be alone.

475
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,030
Totally alone.

476
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,530
You want to blow off the beach party so you and me can

477
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,100
Go to palm springs?

478
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,960
I'm ready. I'm ready to go to palm springs.

479
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,930
Well, then, uh...

480
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:11,800
Let's... go to palm springs.

481
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,960
Okay, let's.

482
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,260
I'm gonna go to palm springs.

483
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,730
Look at them with their frisbees,

484
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,130
Frisbee-ing their cares away.

485
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,100
Hey, we don't have to do this today.

486
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,330
No, it's okay,, I told navid I would show up.

487
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,360
You haven't told him about the you-know-what?

488
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,700
No, not yet.

489
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,360
I mean, I wanted to, I just, I don't...

490
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,730
I don't really know what to say.

491
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,400
I mean, how do you tell your boyfriend

492
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,100
That you're pregnant with somebody else's you-know-what?

493
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,160
He's such a great guy.

494
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,030
And he's so happy right now.

495
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,300
I'm going to tell him, eventually.

496
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,330
I just...

497
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,160
When the timing is right.

498
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,630
You don't have to decide today, okay?

499
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,060
Today is

500
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,200
About frisbee-ing your cares away!

501
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,130
Okay.

502
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,100
Come on, I think we're all set up over here.

503
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:43,460
So... here we are, in palm springs.

504
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,460
Yeah, uh, we are here in palm springs.

505
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,330
Do you want me to show you around.

506
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,560
- Yeah. - I haven't been here in ages.

507
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,330
Um, this is the dining room.

508
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:55,060
-Nice! -yeah.

509
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,860
Uh, kitchen.

510
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,060
Very nice.

511
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,960
And... this is the living room.

512
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,160
Awesome.

513
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,660
Yeah. uh, you can just

514
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,700
Leave your bags

515
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,530
- Wherever. - yeah.

516
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,760
Uh, yeah, um, and out here,

517
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,460
This... is...

518
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,830
The pool.

519
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,460
Wow, cool.

520
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,630
Uh, then back there is the bedroom,

521
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,760
And...

522
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,460
Bedroom?

523
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,400
Uh...

524
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,530
D-do you want to play cards?

525
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,700
Uh... cards?

526
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,900
Or anything?

527
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,760
Or food-- we should probably get food.

528
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,930
- Are you hungry? - yeah.

529
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,930
Let's get some food, and then...

530
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,230
Then you can... show me the bedroom.

531
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,230
Sounds good.

532
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,560
God, what do you have in that bag, a body?

533
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,300
Like a very heavy but small body?

534
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,430
We're making a sand castle.

535
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,900
No, not just a  sand castle,

536
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,260
The greatest sand castle.

537
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,960
What?

538
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,900
Um... nothing.

539
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,600
Let's just build a sand castle.

540
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,560
Yeah.

541
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,060
You know, I used to be a, uh, major drip- castle aficionado,

542
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,160
But people didn't think that that's inherently amateurish.

543
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,430
And I disagree.

544
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,100
Done well, they can be very gaudi.

545
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,960
Not gaudy. gaudi.

546
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,460
Spanish architect.

547
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,500
Yeah, sure, right.

548
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,160
Water in that one. go.

549
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,300
Yes, ma'am.

550
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,700
Oh, my god.

551
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,030
I heard west bev's

552
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,660
Favorite train-wreck druggie

553
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,660
Is back on the tracks.

554
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,100
Get it?

555
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,030
Tracks?

556
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,930
Get lost, george.

557
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,960
Go!

558
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,200
Geez.

559
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,530
Ignore him.

560
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,530
He's a total sponge.

561
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,630
Yeah.

562
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:28,200
Did annie call you to check in?

563
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,610
She didn't say when this beach party would be over.

564
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,130
No.

565
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,800
Harry wore cloth diapers.

566
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,230
What?

567
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:41,130
By which I mean...

568
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,500
I have been doing this parenting thing

569
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
For a long, long time.

570
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,430
Where is annie?

571
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,400
I gave her the keys to my house

572
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,660
In palm springs.

573
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,360
Let me explain.

574
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,660
You can try.

575
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,400
She needed some alone time, some time away from the family.

576
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,760
She's a teenager,

577
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,230
And it isn't easy being a teenager.

578
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:04,000
We forget-- it's very stressful.

579
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,360
I did what I thought was best.

580
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,000
You sent our daughter to palm springs alone?

581
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,200
Now, don't get your hackles up, debbie.

582
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,200
She's perfectly safe, I assure you.

583
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,030
She's in palm springs.

584
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,560
Your mother sent our daughter

585
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,900
To her house in palm springs.

586
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,160
Where I just installed

587
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,460
A fancy-shmancy security system.

588
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,060
Safety is one thing, but that's not even the point.

589
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,360
Then what is the point?

590
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,530
The point is that annie is our daughter,

591
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,500
And you had no right to butt in.

592
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,060
I know-- we live under your roof.

593
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,630
But these are our children-- debbie's and mine--

594
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,900
And, mom, if you can't accept that,

595
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,400
we can move out from under your roof

596
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,400
Who knew liverould come in so many forms?

597
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,130
Yeah, okay, so...

598
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:07,600
Set menu, seven courses, this is number, what, three?

599
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,260
With any luck, uh, we'll be

600
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,000
Out of here by the time our college applications are due.

601
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,800
Great. oh.

602
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,160
My mom!

603
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,800
But my grandma said

604
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,600
Everything is cool with her, and tonight is about

605
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,760
Being alone with you, so no calls.

606
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,500
Yeah, apparently, no edible food, either.

607
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,000
Um, sweetbreads are not actually

608
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,300
Sweet bread, in case you were wondering.

609
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,200
Um...

610
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,630
I'm ready.

611
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,400
To go to palm springs.

612
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,000
Then let's get out of here.

613
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,860
And I want him

614
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,800
You're finally here.

615
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,830
What the hell? you guys told everyone

616
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,100
Adrianna's a druggie?

617
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,800
Uh, yeah.

618
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,830
That's what you told us-- that she's a train-wreck druggie.

619
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,800
Yeah, well, she's not, okay, she's my friend.

620
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,630
And from now on, no one talks trash

621
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,660
About any of my friends.

622
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,830
Got it?

623
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,730
But I thought... yeah, it's...

624
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,260
It's no problem. sure.

625
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,500
But I thought...

626
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,860
No problem.

627
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,160
Good.

628
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,730
I love you.

629
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,330
I love you.

630
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

631
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,100
- What's going on?  - nothing,

632
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,400
Nothing, I'm sorry.

633
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,700
What?

634
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,060
It's just... I just waited for this moment for so long

635
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,130
And it's kind of incredible, you know.

636
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,200
I'm just, I'm really kind of nervous.

637
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,600
Well, tha-that's okay, that's normal.

638
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,030
It's just... it's a big deal.

639
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:21,300
Today I'm a virgin and tomorrow I won't be,

640
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,460
And this is really, really important to me,

641
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,330
And I always thought I would do it with someone

642
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,600
That I really cared about,

643
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,430
You know, someone who was the one,

644
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,260
Maybe the one and only.

645
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,130
And I think I found him.

646
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,030
I'm sorry.

647
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,330
What?

648
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,060
I don't think I can do this.

649
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,000
what if things of us don't work out

650
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,130
What do you mean? you think we're going to break up?

651
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,260
No, no, I just...

652
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,030
What if something happens and...

653
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:24,830
You and i... don't work

654
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,260
And I end up hurting you?

655
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,060
I don't want to hurt you.

656
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,000
Too late. you just did.

657
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,160
Ah!

658
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,360
Ha, ha.

659
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,100
Yo, navid, where's your girlfriend at?

660
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,660
'cause we could use someone with a hollow leg on our team.

661
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,030
Or...

662
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,730
Maybe she's only into harder stuff.

663
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,300
Adrianna is clean, george, all right?

664
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,960
She's a druggie, navid.

665
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,360
Wake up and smell the blow.

666
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,700
You shut up.

667
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,530
Oh, my god, navid, stop it.

668
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,860
Navid, stop it, he's not worth it.

669
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,200
He's not worth it.

670
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,360
What was that all about?

671
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,030
It was about you, ade, all right?

672
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:20,460
Are you defending my honor again?

673
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,200
I'm sorry I got out of hand, okay?

674
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,730
You know the rumors aren't true, right?

675
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,130
Of course I know the rumors aren't true.

676
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,030
Um...

677
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,260
"um" what?

678
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,430
You okay?

679
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,500
It's not a good "um."

680
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,300
I'm...

681
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,060
Pregnant.

682
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,030
You're pregnant?

683
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,330
You're joking, right?

684
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,500
It was before we were together.

685
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,760
Hey, I'm just going to walk away.

686
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,330
- No, no, please... - hey, no, don't even worry about it.

687
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,060
- Please, please, please, don't. - I just have to go, okay?

688
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,300
I just need some time to think, all right?

689
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,860
I can't believe annie would go to palm springs

690
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,760
Without asking us first.

691
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,430
The lights are out.

692
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,530
That is ethan's car.

693
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:27,160
Ethan's car.

694
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,600
Harry, remember the fancy- schmancy security system.

695
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,760
Right.

696
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,230
Careful.

697
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,760
Oh, here. there he is. there's ethan.

698
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,960
What's he doing?

699
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:47,730
He's asleep on the couch by himself.

700
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:49,060
Where's annie?

701
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,900
Harry?

702
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,760
Deb!

703
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,960
Over here.

704
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,460
There she is.

705
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,030
Oh. in bed... asleep.

706
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,700
By herself.

707
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,560
What?

708
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,530
Harry. what?

709
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,400
What are we doing?

710
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,300
I don't know. I don't know.

711
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,530
It is probably good for her to have some time away from her parents.

712
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,260
So you're saying we shouldn't just bust in there?

713
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,100
I think not.

714
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,130
You know, I think I've been second-guessing

715
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:27,260
Myself in the parenting department lately.

716
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,600
Why? because of sean?

717
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,460
I guess. sorry.

718
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,830
I know that that's made things harder on you.

719
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,200
Well, your mother's tried to pick up the slack.

720
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,660
As I said.

721
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,960
It's okay.

722
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,160
I guess we're all just trying to do our best.

723
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,760
Even your mother.

724
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,360
Although I can't say

725
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,660
I mind getting away.

726
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,630
I agree.

727
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,960
You smell so good.

728
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,430
What?

729
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,160
Do I have sand on my face or something?

730
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,260
No.

731
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,100
Uh, no.

732
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,830
I love you.

733
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,230
Thank you.

734
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,560
"thank you"?

735
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,000
I don't know what to say.

736
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,660
Don't say anything.

737
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,660
Just... forget it.

738
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,160
What... I have to say something back?

739
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,660
It's obligitory?

740
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,900
Just... forget it, all right?

741
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,600
And now you're mad at me.

742
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,500
That's fantastic.

743
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,700
One minute you love me, and the next minute you're mad at me?

744
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,700
Whatever, silver.

745
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,800
No.

746
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,060
It's not fair.

747
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,260
I didn't do anything.

748
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,800
Why are you mad at me?

749
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,600
Because I didn't say exactly what you said to me?

750
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,030
Is that why you're mad?

751
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,360
Because if that's what you want to do, I'll do it.

752
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,730
Or you could just hold up some cue cards hey...

753
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,100
Then I can read what you want me to say.

754
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,160
You're overreacting.

755
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,530
No, I'm not. I'm just reacting.

756
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,800
But maybe not the way that you wanted, and I am sorry.

757
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,230
Could you please not act like a freak?

758
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,100
Is that what you think of me? a freak?

759
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,230
Screw you, dixon!

760
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,500
I guess we should get going, we got a long drive ahead of us.

761
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,160
Yeah, well, at least the heat wave's over, right?

762
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,200
Oh, my lord, my parents?

763
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,000
Are here in palm springs?

764
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,160
And they're blocking us in.

765
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:48,260
Where... are they?

766
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,830
Mom?

767
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,660
Dad?

768
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,360
Annie?

769
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,630
Ethan.

770
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,860
Mrs. wilson.

771
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,130
Principal wilson.

772
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,730
What are you doing here?

773
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:06,130
I think that we could ask you that very same question.

774
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,460
But we won't.

775
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:12,160
So, I think we all have school today.

776
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,800
Uh... then we should get going.

777
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,300
Right.

778
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,500
Right.

779
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,800
You guys drive safe.

780
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,000
You, too.

781
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,360
Okay.

782
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,560
Bye.

783
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,860
You don't think they...?

784
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,760
I don't even want to think about it.

785
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,800
Harry.

786
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,030
Ade.

787
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,200
It's nice and cool in here.

788
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
Yeah, thank goodness, huh?

789
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,530
So, how did your walking go?

790
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,730
Or is this a bad time?

791
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,930
Do you need to walk some more?

792
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:04,000
No, I'm good. you know, I walked enough.

793
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,460
I think.

794
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,760
And...?

795
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,860
Ade, um...

796
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,430
I want to tell you that I can do this,

797
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,960
That I can handle this, that I can deal with

798
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,530
Having a girlfriend...

799
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,460
Who is pregnant by some other guy.

800
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,430
Navid, I'm not really asking you for anything.

801
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,930
Good.

802
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:31,030
Um... 'cause i-i don't if I can do anything.

803
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,630
Or be anything to you.

804
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:37,030
I... I just really don't know how to handle this.

805
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,760
Okay.

806
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,030
I'm really sorry, ade.

807
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:10,900
Listen... I'm sorry.

808
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,600
It's all right, it's cool.

809
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,500
Yeah?

810
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,030
Sure.

811
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,600
We'll just pretend it never happened.

812
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,900
Okay.

813
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,000
Sounds good.

814
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,930
Uh... I better go.

815
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,330
Okay.

816
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:30,160
So, I'll see you later?

817
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,660
Um... yeah, sure.

818
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,500
Bye.

819
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:00,400
The kids can have the car.

820
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,920
Really?

821
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,830
It was very generous of you

822
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,230
And it will come in handy.

823
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,500
But they have to pay for their own gas,

824
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,660
And their own insurance.

825
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,830
I'm putting my foot down about that.

826
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,000
I am sorry, you know?

827
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,430
I crossed the line.

828
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:18,760
It's hard to know when to get involved and when to butt out.

829
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,730
I want this to work.

830
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,230
But we have to set some ground rules.

831
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,600
That sounds good.

832
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,160
I work well with structure.

833
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,360
But it'll have to wait till I get back.

834
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,560
From?

835
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,060
Concord, massachusetts.

836
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,760
I got the miniseries.

837
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,400
I'm marmee osgood in red coats and blue bloods.

838
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,200
Don't worry, deb.

839
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,230
My decision had nothing to do with you.

840
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,830
I need the work.

841
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,230
I miss it.

842
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,730
And I think you've got everything under control here.

843
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,360
Thanks, tabitha.

844
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,830
Ooh, and I'm glad you gave the kids a car.

845
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:54,130
Because after what you two did in that minivan,

846
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,500
I wouldn't want to drive it either.

847
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,800
So I owe you an apology.

848
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,800
These rumors about you being on drugs

849
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,830
Is the last thing you need right now.

850
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,630
Hey, it's not your fault.

851
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:15,560
Yeah, actually... it is.

852
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,360
I told the blendeds you were using again.

853
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,900
It was before I knew about... you know...

854
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,060
And they told everyone.

855
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,330
Why would you say that?

856
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,560
Because that's what I thought.

857
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,730
I mean, I don't know, I was angry.

858
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,230
Before, when you were using,

859
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,530
I really wanted to help you.

860
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,730
I reached out to you and you really hurt me.

861
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:38,260
You lied and... you let me down.

862
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,630
I know I did.

863
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,760
And I'm sorry.

864
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,030
So...

865
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,660
Where do we stand?

866
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,100
Well, I'm 16...

867
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,800
I'm having a baby,

868
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,530
So that makes me a walking statistic.

869
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,330
And my boyfriend just broke up with me...

870
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,460
What?

871
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,730
Yeah, that's delightful.

872
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:04,230
I'm all alone and I'm going through this.

873
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,130
You're not alone, ade.

874
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:09,400
Okay, I'm here, I'm really here. okay?

875
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,730
And if you want to have this baby,

876
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:13,530
I'll go with you to lamaze class.

877
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:16,300
Or if you don't want to have it, I'll take you to the clinic.

878
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,660
And if you can't decide,

879
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:21,100
I'll sit with you until you can.

880
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,800
If you'll let me.

881
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,760
Thanks.

882
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,160
Naomi, adrianna,

883
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,700
We're waiting!

884
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,300
Lay off the 'roids, you old freak-bag.

885
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,000
Come on.

886
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,900
Ethan?

887
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,800
I need to talk to you.

888
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,600
Uh, yeah, well, you didn't have much to say

889
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,960
In the car ride home this morning.

890
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,630
Last night...

891
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:04,060
I wanted to be with you so badly,

892
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:08,160
But... I freaked out

893
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,560
Because it's not just sex with you.

894
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,060
It's something more.

895
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,530
Hearing those things, the emotions and stuff,

896
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,860
That you attach to sex,

897
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:22,030
It made me realize that I feel the same way.

898
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,330
And I want it, but I just want to make sure

899
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:28,630
That we have a strong...

900
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,760
Whatever, foundation before we get there.

901
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,660
So maybe we could slow things down a little?

902
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,300
And, um, how do you propose we slow things down?

903
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:44,930
Well, I propose a date.

904
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:48,130
Just a typical, normal, boring high school date.

905
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,730
No liver, no seven courses.

906
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:52,230
Just a movie and some making out.

907
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,100
What do you say?

908
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:58,160
I say yes.

909
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,230
I love you, annie wilson.

910
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:06,860
I love you, ethan ward.
