<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,257 --> 00:00:04,499
I want the same stuff
I got last time.

3
00:00:06,019 --> 00:00:09,129
- You had sex with Naomi's sister?
- She told me she was her neighbor.

4
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:11,848
I'm going to destroy Jen
before she destroys me.

5
00:00:12,015 --> 00:00:14,154
I just don't know how.
I'm not giving up.

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,191
Not until Naomi knows the truth.
How you lied to me that night.

7
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,347
You turned me against her!

8
00:00:20,692 --> 00:00:22,704
I'm sorry. I never thanked you
for your help.

9
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,193
You were great.

10
00:00:26,052 --> 00:00:28,940
- We're in public.
- Don't worry. Nobody saw us.

11
00:00:30,177 --> 00:00:33,696
I found this homeless guy. He'd
been mowed over by a hit and run driver.

12
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:35,702
Before I fell down the stairs,

13
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,866
I was pushed, and I know who did it.

14
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,536
We have been dispatched
to spread winter cheer.

15
00:01:05,703 --> 00:01:08,884
And to tell you all:
the Winter Wonderland Dance is near.

16
00:01:15,968 --> 00:01:17,743
Winter Wonderland Dance...

17
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:20,304
I better dust off my princess crown.

18
00:01:20,474 --> 00:01:22,991
- You don't want to go, I get it.
- You do?

19
00:01:23,695 --> 00:01:25,591
I used to love going to dances.

20
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:27,949
Getting ready and going
with someone that I liked,

21
00:01:28,116 --> 00:01:30,074
seeing my friends all dressed up,

22
00:01:30,244 --> 00:01:32,561
but whatever,
that was another lifetime.

23
00:01:32,982 --> 00:01:35,103
We couldn't go even if we wanted to.

24
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,538
Since your dad's going to be there.

25
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:40,440
Actually, he's going
to be away at a conference.

26
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:45,552
But it's no big deal.
Like I said, school dances,

27
00:01:45,722 --> 00:01:46,916
another lifetime.

28
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:50,689
I would, however, like to see that
princess crown of yours sometime though.

29
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,431
I'll be right back.
Wait for me.

30
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,001
Annie, wait.

31
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:02,506
I need to talk to you.

32
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,668
I understand
why you haven't returned my calls.

33
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:11,584
I wouldn't return my calls either,
if I were you.

34
00:02:11,844 --> 00:02:14,587
I made a huge mistake when
I accused you of sleeping with Liam.

35
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:17,459
It was my sister.

36
00:02:17,828 --> 00:02:18,883
Yeah, I heard.

37
00:02:19,143 --> 00:02:21,129
I'm so sorry, Annie.

38
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,212
I should have just listened to you.
I don't even know why I didn't.

39
00:02:24,382 --> 00:02:26,523
Maybe it has to do
with my own insecurities

40
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:28,699
or what happened with Ethan.

41
00:02:30,638 --> 00:02:32,365
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

42
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,612
When I think about
what I put you through...

43
00:02:34,782 --> 00:02:35,847
Hell.

44
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:39,508
You put me through hell.

45
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,294
I can't go to the police.
What am I supposed to say?

46
00:02:50,138 --> 00:02:52,872
That I think he pushed me
right before I fell down the stairs?

47
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:54,961
Tell them you saw
black combat boots.

48
00:02:55,221 --> 00:02:57,669
So? Half the school
wears black combat boots.

49
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,585
- But they didn't threaten you.
- It's not enough.

50
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:02,436
I might not be able to prove that,

51
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,513
but there's gotta be a way
to proove that he's a drug dealer.

52
00:03:06,712 --> 00:03:09,976
Just the person that I wanted to see.
Guys, this is Lila... my star reporter.

53
00:03:10,452 --> 00:03:12,812
Your "star reporter's"
hit a road block.

54
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,754
Kids who do drugs don't exactly
want to advertise it in the Blaze.

55
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:17,780
Who cares about the Blaze?
I need someone

56
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,426
who tell the principal
that Jasper dealt to them.

57
00:03:20,593 --> 00:03:23,054
The principal.
Why didn't you say so?

58
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:26,002
- That should be easy!
- I need that proof.

59
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:27,577
And once I get that proof,

60
00:03:27,747 --> 00:03:30,106
I can go to the administration
and then the authorities.

61
00:03:30,273 --> 00:03:32,916
Once I'm done with that dirtbag,
he won't even know what hit him!

62
00:03:33,926 --> 00:03:35,460
Careful with that pool cue.

63
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:39,339
Right. Sorry.

64
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:49,743
Watch where you're going, freak.

65
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:52,441
Do you kick babies and puppies, too?

66
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:54,867
You cannot pay me
enough money to wear a tutu.

67
00:03:55,037 --> 00:03:56,971
Or go to a West Bev dance?

68
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:01,936
Actually, I'd think it'd be funny

69
00:04:02,106 --> 00:04:04,142
to just go and see
what all this hype's about.

70
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:08,252
- Throw pig's blood on the ballerinas...
- Come on, Liam. I wouldn't do that.

71
00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:10,682
I'll get us a table.

72
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:12,508
I'll be right back.

73
00:04:16,638 --> 00:04:19,474
Would you like to sponsor me?
I'm doing a 5K run to raise money

74
00:04:19,644 --> 00:04:21,256
for breast cancer research.

75
00:04:21,516 --> 00:04:23,550
Sure.
What's up with the T-shirt?

76
00:04:25,174 --> 00:04:28,054
I'm a Ford Warrior in Pink.
It's in honor of my mom.

77
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:30,870
All net proceeds go to the cause.

78
00:04:31,161 --> 00:04:34,120
You should really get one.
Maybe a pink jacket.

79
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,687
Really bring out your eyes.

80
00:04:36,153 --> 00:04:38,690
I'll think about it.
Anything for the cause.

81
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:40,588
That's the spirit.

82
00:04:40,902 --> 00:04:42,320
Listen...

83
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,446
You going to the
Winter Wonderland Dance?

84
00:04:46,055 --> 00:04:49,617
Yeah, Naomi and I are gonna stop by for
a few hours before we go to St. Barts.

85
00:04:50,926 --> 00:04:53,089
So, I'll have to one-up St. Barts

86
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:56,708
if I want you to ditch Naomi
and go with me instead?

87
00:04:58,415 --> 00:05:00,452
Are you asking me to go with you?

88
00:05:00,721 --> 00:05:02,338
Like... on a date?

89
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:03,736
I sure am.

90
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:10,346
I know your idea of a date. You show
up with one girl, leave with another.

91
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:14,489
Whatever. Anyway, here is a
form in case you want to sponsor me.

92
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:23,032
I was like, "Dude,
you are way out of line, douchebag."

93
00:05:23,202 --> 00:05:24,986
You said that to Mr. Huang?

94
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,038
In my head I did.

95
00:05:32,273 --> 00:05:33,869
I should talk to Naomi.

96
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:36,797
See if she's okay.
I haven't spoken to her since the races.

97
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:38,779
Right. Sure.

98
00:05:50,271 --> 00:05:52,764
I just wanted to check in.
Make sure you're okay.

99
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:56,520
Right after everything happened,

100
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,061
I wanted to thank you.

101
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:00,813
- It's all right.
- Let me finish.

102
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:05,360
That's how I felt right
after everything went down.

103
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:09,864
But as I've had more time to think,
I've gotten more and more upset.

104
00:06:10,741 --> 00:06:13,025
You could have put a stop
to this months ago.

105
00:06:13,195 --> 00:06:15,705
- Why didn't you tell me at prom night?
- I wanted to.

106
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,789
I didn't think you'd
believe me over Jen.

107
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:19,848
So you kept it to yourself?

108
00:06:20,545 --> 00:06:22,919
- You don't understand.
- You're right.

109
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:24,671
I don't understand.

110

113
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:53,167
I'm okay.

114
00:06:56,614 --> 00:06:58,764
When am I going to stop liking him?

115
00:07:01,236 --> 00:07:02,834
Just tell Liam how you feel.

116
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:06,857
I can't tell him how I feel.
He should have told me the truth.

117
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:09,424
I don't want to be involved
with someone like that.

118
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,317
Besides, it doesn't matter anyway.

119
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:16,666
I saw him kissing that
barefoot surfer chick.

120
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,601
- Apparently, he likes the smell of B.O.
- They were kissing?

121
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:21,310
- When?
- At the races.

122
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:24,337
Whatever!
I just need to stay strong

123
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:28,909
and find some St. Barts hottie
to take my mind off of everything.

124
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:30,687
How do I look?

125
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,613
I'd ease up on the
lip gloss a little bit.

126
00:07:33,783 --> 00:07:35,875
Be quiet!
I look fantastic.

127
00:07:36,403 --> 00:07:38,525
All right, let's get out of here.

128
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,747
Blue 42, hut-hut! Hike!

129
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:49,797
Go deep! Go deep!

130
00:07:52,768 --> 00:07:54,552
That's what I'm talking about, baby!

131
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:58,004
All right, it's a go
for Troy Polamalu.

132
00:07:58,174 --> 00:08:00,224
- Let's do this.
- Polamalu plays defense.

133
00:08:00,484 --> 00:08:03,728
- Give your man card back right now.
- Whatever, toss the grapes.

134
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:10,553
You gonna ask Ivy
to the dance or what?

135
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:13,622
- What are you talking about?
- She was throwing around hints

136
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:14,947
like crazy.

137
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,326
At least you know if you ask her,
she'll say yes.

138
00:08:18,586 --> 00:08:20,904
I got shot down yesterday.

139
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:22,906
By who? Angelina Jolie?

140
00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:28,669
I asked Silver.

141
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:30,215
To the dance?

142
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,423
Sorry. I should have
run it by you first.

143
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,760
No, it's cool.
Seriously.

144
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:39,111
Not that it matters.
She made up her mind about me.

145
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:40,630
So?

146
00:08:40,797 --> 00:08:43,101
You can get someone to see you
in a different light.

147
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:47,021
- How's that?
- You asking me for advice on girls?

148
00:08:48,766 --> 00:08:51,567
Man card, back in the pocket!

149
00:08:53,103 --> 00:08:54,824
What do you think I should do?

150
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:57,224
You have to prove that
you're not a player anymore.

151
00:08:57,394 --> 00:08:59,492
That you're
serious about being with her.

152
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:01,834
Show her your heart.

153
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:07,792
- "Show her your heart?"
- You burn his man card or should I?

154
00:09:13,806 --> 00:09:16,146
We can totally
go topless in St. Barts.

155
00:09:16,316 --> 00:09:18,449
Please, don't go
topless in St. Barts.

156
00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:21,718
Don't worry. I've been
tanning my tatas in anticipation.

157
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:31,268
I heard what happened with Jen.

158
00:09:31,789 --> 00:09:34,058
- If there's anything you need...
- I'll pass.

159
00:09:34,228 --> 00:09:36,195
You're not exactly
someone I can rely on.

160
00:09:46,512 --> 00:09:49,423
I cannot believe I missed
the grape-tossing contest,

161
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:51,919
'cause I'm pretty much the champion.

162
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:54,181
- Of course you are.
- I'm being serious.

163
00:09:54,437 --> 00:09:57,967
- Here, watch and learn.
- You don't wanna go to the dance?

164
00:10:01,258 --> 00:10:03,931
Why? Are you asking me?

165
00:10:04,191 --> 00:10:06,208
If you don't want to go that's cool.

166
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:09,020
Whatever.
Sure, I'll go.

167
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:31,617
I'm just gonna get
some books from my car.

168
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,058
But you can follow me
there, if you'd like.

169
00:10:35,524 --> 00:10:38,041
I'm waiting for you to mess up.
And when you do,

170
00:10:38,211 --> 00:10:39,258
I'll be there.

171
00:10:40,143 --> 00:10:41,385
Just like Batman.

172
00:10:41,785 --> 00:10:43,804
I know you pushed me
down the stairs.

173
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:48,881
I know you suffered a head injury,

174
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:51,570
but I didn't know you were
suffering from delusions.

175
00:10:51,737 --> 00:10:54,435
- You talked to your doctor about that?
- I know you did it.

176
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:58,247
- And I'm going to bring you down.
- Let me know how that goes.

177
00:11:08,144 --> 00:11:09,482
I need your help.

178
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:17,998
I know who pushed me
down the stairs.

179
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,883
- Who?
- Jasper.

180
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:22,969
My god.

181
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:26,847
I saw him right before I fell.
Or I saw his shoes, but it was him.

182
00:11:27,388 --> 00:11:29,138
But why would he do that?

183
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,302
Cause I told him
to stay away from you.

184
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:35,773
The thing is, I can't prove it. What
I can prove is that he's a drug dealer.

185
00:11:36,448 --> 00:11:39,068
If someone will come forward
and say that he dealt to them.

186
00:11:39,328 --> 00:11:41,544
- Come forward?
- I didn't know if I could ask you

187
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:45,032
cause things have been weird between
us, but I've tried everything else.

188
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:47,247
I really wish I could.

189
00:11:48,223 --> 00:11:50,288
But I'm still on probation.

190
00:11:52,507 --> 00:11:54,000
Can I do it anonymously?

191
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,024
I can't go to the administration
with an anonymous source.

192
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,171
I'm really sorry.

193
00:12:00,864 --> 00:12:01,882
I get it.

194
00:12:05,876 --> 00:12:07,800
I'll figure something else out.

195
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:23,798
You want me to kick your butt
with the blue ball or the orange ball?

196
00:12:24,465 --> 00:12:27,325
Seriously? You took me
out of school to play mini golf?

197
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:31,549
This used to be our thing. Remember that
summer we played mini golf every day?

198
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,403
Yeah, I was ten.

199
00:12:33,573 --> 00:12:35,426
I wasn't, and I
still had a good time.

200
00:12:35,596 --> 00:12:38,418
'Course that might've been
because I schooled you... mom-style.

201
00:12:38,588 --> 00:12:42,382
Swishin' and swashin' and
dishin' it into the hole.

202
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:47,887
- What?
- How long are you going to stay mad?

203
00:12:49,925 --> 00:12:51,349
Can we just go home?

204
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,070
Yes.

205
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,801
After I beat you.

206
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:03,981
- Can I talk to you?
- Free country.

207
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:08,693
I owe you a huge apology.

208
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:12,536
- I should've told who I slept with.
- No kidding.

209
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,734
At first, I didn't
want to hurt Naomi.

210
00:13:16,904 --> 00:13:19,293
Then I was gonna tell her,
but her sister threatened me.

211
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:21,253
What's going on?

212
00:13:27,944 --> 00:13:29,678
Anyway, I just wanted to apologize,

213
00:13:30,383 --> 00:13:31,389
that's all.

214
00:13:33,363 --> 00:13:34,800
I'll see you around.

215
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,272
Yeah, right.

216
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,323
Like an apology
is gonna make it better.

217
00:13:46,877 --> 00:13:48,164
Whatcha thinking?

218
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,557
Nothing, just that...

219
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,674
Naomi's sister sounds like
a sociopath, that's all.

220
00:13:53,844 --> 00:13:55,061
It's crazy.

221
00:13:55,514 --> 00:13:58,913
At the end of the day,
she's the only reason why we all fought,

222
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,986
she is the only reason
why none of us are friends.

223
00:14:02,156 --> 00:14:04,365
If it was me, I'd keep
thinking about the fact that

224
00:14:04,535 --> 00:14:06,632
they should've believed you
in the first place.

225
00:14:06,974 --> 00:14:08,385
That's true.

226
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:12,070
- Sometimes I miss...
- What?

227
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:15,883
I don't know...
Everything.

228
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:21,743
Whatever you do,

229
00:14:22,846 --> 00:14:23,846
I'm here.

230
00:14:25,022 --> 00:14:28,195
And by the way, what time
should I pick you up for the dance?

231
00:14:28,945 --> 00:14:31,350
- What?
- If you used to have fun at dances,

232
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,368
then I see no reason why
we won't have fun together.

233
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:37,538
But dances are not your thing.

234
00:14:38,426 --> 00:14:40,249
Making you happy is my thing.

235
00:14:55,602 --> 00:14:57,219
I'm sorry I lied to you.

236
00:14:57,389 --> 00:14:58,948
I was trying to protect you.

237
00:14:59,118 --> 00:15:01,622
It came from a good
place, but I was wrong.

238
00:15:03,073 --> 00:15:04,815
But you owe me an apology, too.

239
00:15:05,398 --> 00:15:07,487
What you said about
me not being your real mom,

240
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,415
that was incredibly hurtful.

241
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:11,155
I was just mad.

242
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:12,698
It was a low blow.

243
00:15:15,502 --> 00:15:17,607
I remember when you first
came to live with us,

244
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:21,476
I would watch you sleep at night,
wondering if you would ever let me in.

245
00:15:21,646 --> 00:15:24,752
You were so quiet and so withdrawn.

246
00:15:25,012 --> 00:15:26,545
I didn't know what to say.

247
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,160
I went from sharing
a room with my grandmother,

248
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,578
praying that we'd have enough money
to keep the heat on to this big house

249
00:15:34,748 --> 00:15:36,138
in the suburbs.

250
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:43,298
I knew it would be
a hard adjustment.

251
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,327
I don't think I knew how hard.

252
00:15:46,744 --> 00:15:48,391
Everything was different.

253
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:49,594
Everything.

254
00:15:50,245 --> 00:15:52,656
I woke up one morning
surrounded by white people

255
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,320
I was supposed to bond with...
like that.

256
00:15:58,597 --> 00:16:00,371
I never thought I would though.

257
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:02,475
I kept telling myself,

258
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:05,751
"Just hang in there until you're 18,
get yourself out of there."

259
00:16:07,524 --> 00:16:09,826
I kept telling myself,
"Just keep trying

260
00:16:09,996 --> 00:16:12,299
and maybe one day
he won't look so miserable."

261
00:16:14,981 --> 00:16:16,850
You got used to Annie first.

262
00:16:17,698 --> 00:16:20,411
She wouldn't leave me alone.
Coming in my room

263
00:16:20,581 --> 00:16:23,286
telling me how super-duper
it was to have a big brother.

264
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,855
I would watch you with her laughing

265
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:29,066
and I would be so jealous
of my eight-year-old daughter.

266
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:35,770
Sometimes I...

267
00:16:36,654 --> 00:16:38,344
I think about my life now,

268
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:40,494
in Beverly Hills,

269
00:16:41,874 --> 00:16:43,788
how I got from there to here.

270
00:16:44,224 --> 00:16:46,130
It just doesn't make any sense.

271
00:16:48,362 --> 00:16:50,344
But one thing I never question...

272
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:53,243
is that you're my mom.

273
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:09,734
Excuse me, everybody.

274
00:17:10,265 --> 00:17:13,104
Sorry to interrupt. I just
have a little announcement to make.

275
00:17:13,274 --> 00:17:16,447
And making it public would be
a good way to let a certain someone know

276
00:17:16,707 --> 00:17:17,974
I'm serious.

277
00:17:19,174 --> 00:17:20,546
I'm done dating.

278
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,408
Totally done.

279
00:17:23,036 --> 00:17:25,396
Because I met someone very special.

280
00:17:27,164 --> 00:17:29,064
Someone I want to commit to.

281
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:30,759
I mean it, Silver.

282
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,970
I like you more than
I've ever liked anyone.

283
00:17:36,906 --> 00:17:38,385
And we're friends

284
00:17:39,671 --> 00:17:43,474
which is not the way I've started
relationships in the past, clearly.

285
00:17:43,734 --> 00:17:45,852
But with you, everything
feels different.

286
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:49,619
If you give me a chance,
I promise I won't let you down.

287
00:17:54,995 --> 00:17:57,016
Will you go to the dance with me?

288
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:58,822
Please?

289
00:18:03,064 --> 00:18:04,970
- What?
- Teddy, stop.

290
00:18:06,675 --> 00:18:08,318
It's not gonna happen.

291
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,605
All right, guys, everyone
who already has tickets to the left

292
00:18:34,772 --> 00:18:37,851
and if you still have to buy them
to the right. My right, your left.

293
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:40,008
Unless, of course,
you're walking backwards.

294
00:18:40,175 --> 00:18:43,575
But, please, don't walk backwards,
that would be foolish.

295
00:18:45,498 --> 00:18:48,001
I wanted to say I'm sorry
that I believed Jen.

296
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:49,701
Oh, man, it's okay.

297
00:18:49,868 --> 00:18:52,756
I'm just glad it's over, you know?
Thank God, we're rid of her.

298
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:54,569
Thank God.

299
00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:55,986
Hey, go, enjoy.

300
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,552
All right, see you later.

301
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:06,228
Two tickets please.

302
00:19:06,657 --> 00:19:08,107
How you doing, Ade?

303
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:10,379
Fine.

304
00:19:13,011 --> 00:19:16,196
- How do you guys know each other?
- We have, gym together.

305
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,056
Ade here is quite
the newcomb player.

306
00:19:22,473 --> 00:19:23,923
Are you two dating?

307
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,389
We sure are.

308
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:30,601
We will catch you later, Ade.

309
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:04,169
Weird.

310
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,463
So, this is, what people do at a dance
when they don't have dates?

311
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,133
- We can go get some more food.
- I don't know, I'm not really hungry.

312
00:20:19,354 --> 00:20:20,517
Me neither.

313
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,016
She looks beautiful?

314
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:34,566
Yeah, she does.

315
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:40,231
Wish me luck.

316
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,913
No phones. You're my date.

317
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,059
I just want to confirm
our flight 'cause...

318
00:20:51,226 --> 00:20:52,461
- Oh, my God!
- What?

319
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:55,318
I'm wearing white and I left
the pink shell on my cell phone.

320
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:58,048
Please, let me have put
the white one in here!

321
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,848
- Baby blue, kill me now!
- I'd like to.

322
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,598
- Oh, thank God!
- Amen.

323
00:21:11,732 --> 00:21:12,932
Dance with me?

324
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,960
Come on, one dance.

325
00:21:17,718 --> 00:21:19,083
Between friends.

326
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,772
Fine, between friends.

327
00:21:52,783 --> 00:21:55,514
You know, I probably shouldn't
leave Naomi for too long

328
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,581
since she's my date and all.

329
00:21:57,748 --> 00:21:59,448
I'm sure she'll survive.

330
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,460
Of course.
Of course she will.

331
00:22:06,574 --> 00:22:08,124
Is it, is it snowing?

332
00:22:12,868 --> 00:22:14,218
Oh, my God, yeah.

333
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:16,251
I think it is.

334
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:19,629
- That was awesome.
- You're ridiculous.

335
00:22:31,524 --> 00:22:33,574
These are actually really cute.

336
00:22:46,904 --> 00:22:47,991
How is it...

337
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,054
If you can honestly tell me you didn't
feel anything, I'll stop trying.

338
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:10,954
You know what?

339
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:13,139
I'm done.

340
00:23:18,249 --> 00:23:20,732
Okay, Teddy is officially an ass.

341
00:23:21,636 --> 00:23:23,296
Are you okay?
What happened?

342
00:23:23,575 --> 00:23:25,344
He says he wants a friendly dance.

343
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:28,092
We go out there and he tries
to make it all romantic.

344
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:30,742
I mean, okay, so what if I
felt something when we kissed?

345
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,239
That doesn't change the fact that...

346
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:37,089
You just said you felt
something when you kissed.

347
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:41,459
Okay, yeah.

348
00:23:43,476 --> 00:23:44,826
So what if I did?

349
00:23:45,848 --> 00:23:48,010
What difference does it make?
He's still a player.

350
00:23:48,435 --> 00:23:51,285
But he seems to really,
really care about you.

351
00:23:53,103 --> 00:23:55,075
And if you feel the same way,

352
00:23:55,242 --> 00:23:57,142
then you have to go for it.

353
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,680
Otherwise, the moment could pass.

354
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,713
And the guy you like
will end up with some she-male

355
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,930
who only has one pair of shoes.

356
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,366
You want to dance, don't you?

357
00:24:21,533 --> 00:24:23,448
No, no, definitely not.

358
00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:28,050
Okay, maybe a little bit,

359
00:24:28,428 --> 00:24:30,927
but, you know, it will pass.

360
00:24:32,557 --> 00:24:33,597
Let's do it.

361
00:24:34,445 --> 00:24:35,474
Are you sure?

362
00:24:43,117 --> 00:24:44,467
Just one problem.

363
00:24:45,181 --> 00:24:46,531
I don't know how.

364
00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:48,499
At all?

365
00:24:49,412 --> 00:24:52,162
- I've never been to a dance before.
- Okay.

366
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:54,729
Well then, I am honored
to teach you.

367
00:24:55,741 --> 00:24:58,191
All right, so, just
put one hand here.

368
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:01,625
And the other hand here.
And we just move back and forth.

369
00:25:04,415 --> 00:25:05,715
You're doing it.

370
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,480
With you, I can do anything.

371
00:25:14,935 --> 00:25:18,659
Awful right? I swear, I'd be doing her
a favor if I vomited on them.

372
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,473
What are you talking about?

373
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,204
Vicki Rosen's shoes.
Isn't that what you were looking at?

374
00:25:24,371 --> 00:25:27,421
No, I was watching Annie
dance with a drug dealer.

375
00:25:28,156 --> 00:25:29,906
That guy's a drug dealer?

376
00:25:32,947 --> 00:25:35,997
- Has anyone told Annie?
- Yeah, she won't listen.

377
00:25:43,022 --> 00:25:44,572
This is all my fault.

378
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,708
I took away all her friends
when I sent that naked text around.

379
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,795
I made it so
that she was completely alone.

380
00:25:49,962 --> 00:25:53,248
Of course she would end up with a guy
like that. We have to do something.

381
00:25:53,415 --> 00:25:55,220
We've tried.
Nothing seems to work.

382
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,070
We have to try harder!

383
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,484
There you are!

384
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,749
This is my sister, Savannah.
Back from boarding school.

385
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:26,835
- This is Dixon.
- Nice to meet you.

386
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,356
Nice to meet you, too.

387
00:26:28,523 --> 00:26:30,130
So, what are you doing here?

388
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,705
After getting some of the
saddest texts I've ever read,

389
00:26:32,872 --> 00:26:35,006
I wanted to make sure you were okay.

390
00:26:35,173 --> 00:26:37,637
So, come on. Who's this girl that's
breaking your heart?

391
00:26:49,037 --> 00:26:52,487
So, one is coconut, one is lemon.
I forgot which is which.

392
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,834
Is everything okay?

393
00:27:01,338 --> 00:27:03,906
Look, Liam, just be real
with me, okay?

394
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,791
Do you still have
feelings for Naomi?

395
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:08,741
- What?
- Dude, do you?

396
00:27:11,203 --> 00:27:14,356
Come on, I'm a big girl. It's not like
I'm gonna go cry into my pillow

397
00:27:14,523 --> 00:27:17,673
at night if that's what
you're worried about. But...

398
00:27:18,052 --> 00:27:19,802
But I do deserve to know.

399
00:27:25,305 --> 00:27:27,173
Yeah, I do.

400
00:27:29,229 --> 00:27:30,829
That's what I thought.

401
00:27:33,263 --> 00:27:36,313
So, what the hell are you
doing hanging around me?

402
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:39,074
Why don't you just go
tell her how you feel?

403
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,687
Because she doesn't want
anything to do with me.

404
00:27:46,366 --> 00:27:49,466
- I'm really sorry.
- Like I said, I'm fine. I'm...

405
00:27:51,449 --> 00:27:52,449
... fine.

406
00:28:05,096 --> 00:28:06,346
I'll take that.

407
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:09,062
Look, I have no idea
how this got in here.

408
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:12,262
I know, I confiscated it
earlier from some kids.

409
00:28:13,719 --> 00:28:16,528
You know, why don't you take off?
You did a good job tonight.

410
00:28:20,983 --> 00:28:23,833
- Have a nice break, Mr. Matthews.
- You, too.

411
00:28:42,737 --> 00:28:46,015
I'm just saying, you are
quite the natural dancer.

412
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,828
I'm just saying, you're a good liar.

413
00:28:50,002 --> 00:28:53,152
I'm gonna go get us some
drinks, I'll be right back.

414
00:28:55,436 --> 00:28:57,469
I need you to come with me,
it's an emergency.

415
00:28:57,636 --> 00:28:59,986
- Is everything okay?
- No, come on.

416
00:29:07,421 --> 00:29:08,721
What's going on?

417
00:29:10,809 --> 00:29:12,834
Annie, we're here
because we care about you.

418
00:29:13,842 --> 00:29:15,795
Annie, Jasper's a really bad guy.

419
00:29:16,577 --> 00:29:18,954
- What the hell?
- Look, we don't want you to get hurt.

420
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:23,740
What is this?
Some kind of misguided intervention?

421
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,765
No, we're just worried about you.

422
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:27,432
Annie, this is all my fault.

423
00:29:27,964 --> 00:29:30,810
I completely alienated you
and I'm so sorry.

424
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,312
But you deserve better.

425
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:35,065
- I can't believe this.
- He's a drug dealer, Annie.

426
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,775
- He's not.
- He is.

427
00:29:37,288 --> 00:29:40,288
And I'm pretty sure he
pushed me down the stairs.

428
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:43,948
What?
That is, that's absurd.

429
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:46,882
- No, it's not absurd.
- I don't know what you think about him

430
00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:50,979
but it's not true. You just
have it out for him for some reason.

431
00:29:51,146 --> 00:29:52,524
And you've started a rumor.

432
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:55,502
A rumor that the rest of you
are choosing to believe.

433
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:59,506
The way that you chose to believe
a rumor about me that was not true.

434
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,133
Annie, it's not a rumor.
I know this guy's a drug dealer.

435
00:30:02,588 --> 00:30:04,238
What proof do you have?

436
00:30:05,032 --> 00:30:07,347
- We don't have proof, per se.
- That's what I thought.

437
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,297
I bought drugs from him.

438
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,100
What?

439
00:30:14,376 --> 00:30:17,326
I've been buying from Jasper
for the last month.

440
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,610
And I'm willing to come forward.

441
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:25,365
I'm willing to tell the
administration that I did it.

442
00:30:29,836 --> 00:30:32,192
- Annie, wait.
- Look, I just...

443
00:30:33,547 --> 00:30:34,997
I need to be alone.

444
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:54,269
So, are you seriously willing
to go to administration?

445
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:57,122
He's a really bad guy.

446
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,859
And seeing him with Annie
made me realize I have to do something.

447
00:31:01,721 --> 00:31:04,022
That's really selfless.

448
00:31:05,377 --> 00:31:07,427
What if you get suspended, Ade?

449
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:12,531
Well, I hope you don't.

450
00:31:12,698 --> 00:31:13,998
Yeah, me either.

451
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:18,141
Maybe when we get
back from St. Bart's...

452
00:31:18,314 --> 00:31:19,914
We can talk and stuff.

453
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:21,889
I'd really like that.

454
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:27,358
Hey, can I talk to you for a sec?

455
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:29,063
Yeah, sure.

456
00:31:30,137 --> 00:31:31,639
Guys, have an amazing trip.

457
00:31:31,968 --> 00:31:34,368
- Have a good holiday.
- Merry Christmas.

458
00:31:41,431 --> 00:31:43,031
- What?
- Oh, my God.

459
00:31:46,766 --> 00:31:48,767
I don't want you to go
to the administration.

460
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:50,004
What, why?

461
00:31:50,171 --> 00:31:52,583
The important thing is that
Annie knows the truth.

462
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,831
I'll find some other way
to bring Jasper down.

463
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:56,229
But I could just go...

464
00:31:56,396 --> 00:31:58,404
If you come forward,
you'll be expelled, Ade.

465
00:31:58,571 --> 00:31:59,571
Maybe not.

466
00:31:59,738 --> 00:32:02,288
I'll explain to them
that I'm clean now.

467
00:32:05,526 --> 00:32:07,175
I'm willing to take the risk.

468
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,968
You might be, but I'm not.

469
00:32:11,545 --> 00:32:14,045
Look, despite what
happened between us,

470
00:32:15,138 --> 00:32:16,935
I still care about you, okay?

471
00:32:19,274 --> 00:32:20,274
Okay.

472
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:26,943
Whatcha doing?

473
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,782
I came with Naomi and
she had to do something. So,

474
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,432
called a cab
and just waiting for it.

475
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:34,599
Cool.

476
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,538
Tense night?

477
00:32:38,768 --> 00:32:40,118
Yeah, no kidding.

478
00:32:42,854 --> 00:32:43,962
Everything okay?

479
00:32:47,513 --> 00:32:48,513
Come on.

480
00:32:49,002 --> 00:32:50,952
I mean, we're friends, right?

481
00:32:55,077 --> 00:32:56,127
It's Teddy.

482
00:32:58,575 --> 00:33:00,275
He's been asking me out.

483
00:33:00,694 --> 00:33:01,744
No kidding.

484
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,220
Yeah, and...

485
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,080
I was actually going to tell him

486
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:09,431
that we should give it a shot.

487
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:13,223
But I saw him with this
blonde girl and...

488
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:15,474
You were there, actually.
She was...

489
00:33:15,641 --> 00:33:18,162
gorgeous and in this red dress.

490
00:33:21,394 --> 00:33:24,961
I don't even know why I'm surprised.
The guy is a huge player, right?

491
00:33:29,431 --> 00:33:30,531
Yeah, he is.

492
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:36,097
But, hey, I mean, at least
you realized it before it was too late.

493
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,490
Definitely.

494
00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:42,903
Still hurts, though.

495
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:48,211
Look, Silver,

496
00:33:49,676 --> 00:33:51,076
Teddy's my friend.

497
00:33:51,552 --> 00:33:52,852
But, you, you...

498
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,610
You deserve way, way better.

499
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,435
I mean, come on.
You're amazing.

500
00:33:59,876 --> 00:34:00,876
Stop.

501
00:34:03,328 --> 00:34:04,428
No. You are.

502
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:09,066
And for the life of me, I...

503
00:34:10,626 --> 00:34:13,026
Can't remember
why I ever let you go.

504
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,950
- What's wrong?
- There she is.

505
00:34:26,812 --> 00:34:28,107
The girl I can't get.

506
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:31,787
Let's just get out of here.

507
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,850
What was that?

508
00:34:39,676 --> 00:34:40,826
I don't know.

509
00:34:47,396 --> 00:34:48,646
That's my ride.

510
00:34:51,116 --> 00:34:52,566
We, we should talk.

511
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:55,939
When I get back from St. Barts?

512
00:34:56,106 --> 00:34:57,679
Definitely, we should.

513
00:35:13,918 --> 00:35:15,655
Hey, you.
How was the dance?

514
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,617
Oh, it was... interesting.

515
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:22,353
Any way I can get half?

516
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:23,760
You sure can.

517
00:35:24,201 --> 00:35:25,201
Thanks.

518
00:35:25,777 --> 00:35:29,149
You know, I've got to tell you. I'm
so glad we finally got a chance to talk.

519
00:35:29,316 --> 00:35:32,616
- I've been thinking about it all day.
- Yeah, me, too.

520
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,180
And everything that we talked about.

521
00:35:36,205 --> 00:35:38,553
I hadn't thought about the
adoption in awhile, you know?

522
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,203
Yeah, me, neither.

523
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:43,099
And, you know, talking about everything
made me realize something.

524
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,949
Oh, yeah? What's that?

525
00:35:47,763 --> 00:35:50,106
I think it's time for me
to see my birth mom.

526
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:09,834
Can I come in?

527
00:36:10,755 --> 00:36:12,655
Yeah. Yeah, sure, of course.

528
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:20,152
What's that?

529
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,723
Nothing. So...

530
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:28,098
- What's going on?
- You tell me.

531
00:36:28,265 --> 00:36:30,542
Ivy sent me a text telling me
I had to come over here.

532
00:36:30,709 --> 00:36:32,623
There was something
you wanted to tell me.

533
00:36:34,702 --> 00:36:37,126
- She shouldn't have done that.
- Well, she did.

534
00:36:37,293 --> 00:36:40,425
I'm here and I'm about to take off
to St. Barts soon. So what is it that

535
00:36:40,592 --> 00:36:43,257
- she thought you wanted to tell me?
- I don't know.

536
00:36:44,681 --> 00:36:46,704
Why? Is there something
you want to tell me?

537
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:48,871
I asked you first.

538
00:36:49,212 --> 00:36:51,762
- And I came over here, Liam.
- Exactly.

539
00:36:53,989 --> 00:36:55,739
What'd you come over for?

540
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,984
I don't know. I guess I thought
things were going to be different.

541
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:02,702
You would be different.
But you know what, you're not.

542
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:05,805
You're private and secretive,
just like you always were.

543
00:37:05,972 --> 00:37:08,050
That was the whole problem
all along.

544
00:37:08,217 --> 00:37:09,760
You'll never be able to open up.

545
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,615
You can't tell me
what's under your stupid tarp.

546
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,640
Whatever. I'm done.

547
00:37:18,114 --> 00:37:19,114
Wait.

548
00:37:33,698 --> 00:37:35,198
I'm building a boat.

549
00:37:42,168 --> 00:37:43,168
Why?

550
00:37:44,493 --> 00:37:45,643
Things are...

551
00:37:47,124 --> 00:37:48,224
Bad at home.

552
00:37:48,682 --> 00:37:52,186
They told me at the Wilderness Program
to redirect my anger, so...

553
00:37:53,552 --> 00:37:56,252
Whenever I get upset,
I just come out here.

554
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:59,043
And I build.

555
00:38:00,251 --> 00:38:01,301
Why a boat?

556
00:38:04,389 --> 00:38:05,639
I used to sail.

557
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:08,484
With my dad before...

558
00:38:10,787 --> 00:38:12,287
Before he went away.

559
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,826
Naomi, I'm so sorry.

560
00:38:17,745 --> 00:38:20,250
I should have told you about Jen.
After prom,

561
00:38:20,557 --> 00:38:22,898
she came up to me and she told me
she was your neighbor.

562
00:38:23,065 --> 00:38:25,120
And all the personal stuff
that I had told you,

563
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:28,113
she said she overheard you
telling your friends about it,

564
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,670
- and laughing.
- What?

565
00:38:29,978 --> 00:38:32,775
Afterwards, when I found
out she was your sister,

566
00:38:33,122 --> 00:38:34,622
I realized she lied.

567
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,530
But by then, it was too late.

568
00:38:39,669 --> 00:38:41,469
I didn't want to hurt you.

569
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,823
And like you said,
I'm private and secretive.

570
00:38:46,303 --> 00:38:47,953
But I don't want to be.

571
00:38:53,938 --> 00:38:56,238
And if you give me another chance...

572
00:38:58,697 --> 00:38:59,747
I won't be.

573
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,696
Hey, there you are.

574
00:39:36,471 --> 00:39:39,421
I've been looking for you
for, like, 45 minutes.

575
00:39:41,009 --> 00:39:42,459
Babe, are you okay?

576
00:39:43,285 --> 00:39:44,632
You're a drug dealer.

577
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,022
- What are you talking about?
- Don't...

578
00:39:47,189 --> 00:39:48,389
Don't deny it.

579
00:39:48,881 --> 00:39:51,981
Ade told me that you sold to her.
I know it's true.

580
00:39:57,526 --> 00:39:58,926
Okay.
It is true.

581
00:40:00,494 --> 00:40:03,567
But I, I only sold to people
who were going to buy it anyway.

582
00:40:03,817 --> 00:40:05,945
- Stop.
- Babe, it's all to finance the film.

583
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,566
Just stop.

584
00:40:09,921 --> 00:40:13,071
- I don't even know who you are.
- That is not true.

585
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:17,148
You know me, Annie, and I know you.
Come on.

586
00:40:18,684 --> 00:40:21,085
You pushed Navid down
the stairs, too, didn't you?

587
00:40:22,167 --> 00:40:24,422
- No...
- No more lies.

588
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:28,551
Okay, please.
Just no more lies.

589
00:40:29,391 --> 00:40:31,392
I didn't push him down the stairs.

590
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:34,140
I pushed him, then he fell.

591
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,521
- Look, Annie.
- No, don't. Stay away from me.

592
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,816
- You don't mean that.
- Yeah, I do.

593
00:40:44,324 --> 00:40:46,585
Why? Because I've
made some mistakes?

594
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,848
You've made mistakes,
but I don't judge you.

595
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,575
What are you talking about?

596
00:40:53,093 --> 00:40:55,811
I accidentally pushed Navid
down the stairs.

597
00:40:57,718 --> 00:41:00,218
And you accidentally
ran over my uncle.
