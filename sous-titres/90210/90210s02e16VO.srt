00:00:02,632 --> 00:00:04,891
News flash...
Teddy Montgomery is a major player.

3
00:00:05,061 --> 00:00:07,368
No need to worry.
Just be sensible, that's all.

4
00:00:07,538 --> 00:00:10,171
Check his e-mail, monitor his
cell phone and follow him.

5
00:00:10,338 --> 00:00:12,596
- You spied on me?
- It's never gonna happen again.

6
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,807
- Cause now I know I can trust you.
- I need some space.

7
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,873
Hi, I'm Dana.
I'm Dixon's birth mom.

8
00:00:18,043 --> 00:00:20,974
My son's birth mother has come
to stay with us for a little while.

9
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:23,281
- How's that going?
- It's hard for him.

10
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:26,896
- How is it going for you?
- This anxiety was for nothing, right?

11
00:00:27,156 --> 00:00:29,256
Everything I'm feeling is valid.

12
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,930
Where the hell is my car?

13
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,347
Who do you think got rid of
the one piece of evidence

14
00:00:33,514 --> 00:00:35,410
that's linking you
to my uncle's death?

15
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,537
You like somebody.
You haven't told me?

16
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,452
The problem is... I like you.

17
00:00:59,211 --> 00:01:01,741
You mind?
This space is occupied.

18
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,768
Come on.
It's the last one in the lot.

19
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:20,890
Annie, slow down.

20
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:25,080
I know that you're freaked out
over what I did, and I'm sorry.

21
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,321
But I was just trying to help you.

22
00:01:27,491 --> 00:01:30,182
I don't want anyone to be able
to link you to my uncle's death.

23
00:01:30,352 --> 00:01:31,294
Stop.

24
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,131
You have to know
I'll do anything for you, anything.

25
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:38,429
You really want to do
something for me?

26
00:01:38,811 --> 00:01:40,248
Leave me alone.

27
00:01:49,573 --> 00:01:51,135
Blazers, listen up.

28
00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:54,895
I've got a really exciting announcement
to make. You guys are late.

29
00:01:55,065 --> 00:01:58,003
We have a new faculty advisor...
Mr. Cannon, everyone.

30
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,859
Mr. Cannon brings some
street cred to the Blaze.

31
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:04,788
He was a journalism major
at Columbia,

32
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,296
and he also interned at 60 minutes,
before diving back into academia.

33
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:09,582
Thank you, Navid.

34
00:02:09,842 --> 00:02:12,798
I see my role here as challenging
each and every one of you

35
00:02:12,968 --> 00:02:14,671
to do better, dig deeper,

36
00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:18,049
find the journalistic truth
in all the stories that we tell.

37
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:21,052
- I have a question.
- Yes.

38
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,612
Hi. Naomi Clark.

39
00:02:23,493 --> 00:02:26,707
What happens
if I like you said... dig deeper,

40
00:02:26,877 --> 00:02:28,931
find the journalistic truth,

41
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,063
but it all gets edited out by Navid?

42
00:02:32,975 --> 00:02:34,226
That's because,

43
00:02:34,396 --> 00:02:37,193
- you don't cite your sources.
- And if I'm protecting my sources?

44
00:02:37,968 --> 00:02:41,406
A friend of a friend of a guy you used
to date? That's not a credible source.

45
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:45,618
Actually, I do have to agree with Navid.
If we can't verify thformation,

46
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:48,163
then we shouldn't air it.
We're not a tabloid here.

47
00:02:48,423 --> 00:02:49,377
But we can be.

48
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:52,340
Ever heard of making
a good first impression?

49
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,077
If you'd like me to
review any segments you're unhappy with,

50
00:02:55,247 --> 00:02:57,864
I'd be glad to give you my honest,
unbiased critique,

51
00:02:58,034 --> 00:03:00,855
but I'm warning you,
I have very high standards.

52
00:03:02,687 --> 00:03:05,180
They couldn't be that high,
or you'd be working in news...

53
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,267
And not bossing a bunch of wannabe
kids around for what, 20 grand a year?

54
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:15,607
If you're done, I'd like to discuss
the next Blaze edition.

55
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:17,525
- But I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

56
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,384
Why do we even need
some stupid faculty advisor

57
00:03:25,554 --> 00:03:28,924
watching over our every move?
It's like 1984 all over again.

58
00:03:29,094 --> 00:03:31,873
I hope not. I look horrible
in shoulder pads and a perm.

59
00:03:33,164 --> 00:03:36,742
Come on, Sil, just tell Ade
how bad cannon was, please?

60
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:37,912
Or not.

61
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:43,362
I was wondering if you
want to have lunch today.

62
00:03:43,532 --> 00:03:46,429
Sorry, I'm taking a history make-up.
Got to run, actually.

63
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:50,475
Everything good
with the world again?

64
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:55,640
I just asked him to have lunch,
and he had to make up a history test.

65
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:58,316
Obviously, he's still pissed
at me for spying on him.

66
00:03:58,486 --> 00:04:00,670
That, or he actually has
to make up a history test

67
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,569
and I'm just getting worked
up over nothing. Or both.

68
00:04:03,736 --> 00:04:06,292
You know you can't leave
anything to interpretation with men.

69
00:04:06,462 --> 00:04:09,905
Next time just ask, "am I in or out?
'cause I'm not a *** to ** everyday

70
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:12,103
Just to get rid of zits and pms."

71
00:04:12,273 --> 00:04:15,136
That's your solution?
We're not even having sex yet.

72
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:19,504
No wonder he's blowing you off.
Come on. Right, Ade?

73
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,259
Whatever. I got to run my locker.
I will catch you guys later.

74
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:27,048
Sure.

75
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,258
Wait!

76
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,382
Wait!

77
00:04:35,945 --> 00:04:37,230
Stop!

78
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:46,781
Do you need a ride?

79
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:49,158
I'm all right, thanks.

80
00:04:52,747 --> 00:04:54,414
Come on, let me drive you.

81
00:04:55,715 --> 00:04:57,227
All right, thank you.

82
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:08,127
Sure, the Cavs have Lebron,
but Shaq,

83
00:05:08,294 --> 00:05:10,763
- he's a bloated old man!
- You are preaching to the choir.

84
00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:14,392
I led the petition drive
to try to force him out of Phoenix.

85
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:17,762
I didn't even see you there.

86
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:19,856
So, any dinner requests?

87
00:05:20,117 --> 00:05:23,943
How about my famous mac and cheese?
Heavy on the cheese, light on the mac.

88
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:26,521
Sounds good

89
00:05:26,691 --> 00:05:29,448
but actually, we're about to
go out and watch some march madness.

90
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,931
Don't worry, I know it's a school night.
We won't be out late.

91
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:37,832
Aren't you forgetting something?

92
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:40,687
Bye, mom.

93
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:42,935
- Peace, dad.
- Peace.

94
00:05:43,317 --> 00:05:45,270
Those two seem to be
getting along well.

95
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,507
Yes, they do.

96
00:06:06,643 --> 00:06:08,363
Again, I gotta say,

97
00:06:08,795 --> 00:06:10,816
I was a coward with the Jen thing.

98
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,377
It's over.

99
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,939
I know, I just...

100
00:06:14,109 --> 00:06:17,455
- I should've just came out and...
- Can we talk about something else?

101
00:06:17,715 --> 00:06:19,582
Like, anything in the world?

102
00:06:21,095 --> 00:06:22,095
Sure.

103
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:24,466
- Like what?
- I don't care,

104
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,586
you can pick the subject.

105
00:06:29,787 --> 00:06:30,801
Ferrets.

106
00:06:32,998 --> 00:06:34,181
That's random.

107
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,094
We just passed the Beverly Hilton,

108
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:38,715
which reminded me of Paris Hilton...

109
00:06:39,153 --> 00:06:41,968
Who I think was once caught
with an illegal ferret.

110
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:45,295
I read the tabloids
in my dentist's office.

111
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:49,571
Fascinating insight
into that mysterious brain of yours.

112
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,609
Check out those two.

113
00:06:54,768 --> 00:06:56,452
Someone's reenacting pretty woman.

114
00:07:00,968 --> 00:07:02,125
Are you okay?

115
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,248
That was my stepdad.

116
00:07:07,543 --> 00:07:09,173
And that wasn't my mom with him.

Saison 02 Épisode 16
<i>Clark Raving Mad</i>

119
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:42,415
Navid said you wanted to see me?

120
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,294
If we're going to be working together,
you owe me an apology.

121
00:07:47,352 --> 00:07:49,005
No, you owe me an apology.

122
00:07:51,355 --> 00:07:53,593
You were insulting and belligerent.

123
00:07:53,854 --> 00:07:56,054
Not exactly the apology
I'm looking for.

124
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:58,626
It's kind of like
pulling off a band-aid

125
00:07:58,793 --> 00:08:00,808
if you do it really quickly,
it hardly hurts.

126
00:08:04,411 --> 00:08:05,429
I'm sorry,

127
00:08:06,106 --> 00:08:08,613
but life's too short.
I'm kicking you off the Blaze.

128
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,266
- What?
- You heard me.

129
00:08:12,545 --> 00:08:15,451
I'm sorry for whatever
it is you think I did wrong.

130
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:18,721
Let's see, you were disruptive,
rude,

131
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:21,486
- irritating...
- Fine, I'm sorry for all of that.

132
00:08:21,656 --> 00:08:24,582
- It won't happen again.
- You're absolutely right, it won't.

133
00:08:26,903 --> 00:08:28,552
Please, don't do this.

134
00:08:28,722 --> 00:08:31,343
I finally found something
that I'm really passionate about.

135
00:08:31,513 --> 00:08:35,259
I want an extracurricular on my resume
for college, but it's not just that.

136
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,235
I'm good at this. I'm good on camera,
and I like reporting.

137
00:08:38,405 --> 00:08:40,726
It could be something
that I want to pursue.

138
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,935
Katie Couric's like a
toothy munchkin compared to me.

139
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,331
Please.

140
00:08:45,697 --> 00:08:47,021
Give me another chance.

141
00:08:48,463 --> 00:08:50,316
I'm sorry, I've made my decision.

142
00:08:50,576 --> 00:08:53,085
What do you want?
Just name it, I'll do anything.

143
00:08:53,255 --> 00:08:55,113
Please, I'll do anything.

144
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,993
Are you offering to sleep with me?

145
00:09:01,434 --> 00:09:02,434
What?

146
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:06,082
Because that would be
completely inappropriate.

147
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:09,335
Like I said, you're off the Blaze.

148
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,226
Door's that way.

149
00:09:14,342 --> 00:09:17,736
At the risk of having our first
argument, you are completely wrong.

150
00:09:17,906 --> 00:09:20,892
Marshall Mcluhan invented the term
"channel surfing."

151
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:23,609
He would've definitely considered
the internet a cool medium.

152
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:25,817
It's active not sedentary.

153
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:28,086
What if you use
the internet to watch a movie?

154
00:09:28,256 --> 00:09:31,128
Mcluhan considered movies
to be a hot medium.

155
00:09:31,298 --> 00:09:33,219
- You know what is really hot?
- What?

156
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:35,908
That you even know
who Marshall Mcluhan is.

157
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:38,786
Are you kidding me? Understanding
media: the extensions of man

158
00:09:38,956 --> 00:09:40,731
was my goodnight moon.

159
00:09:41,046 --> 00:09:42,050
That's hot.

160
00:09:48,137 --> 00:09:49,762
I'll see you later.

161
00:09:58,496 --> 00:10:00,845
- You need a hand?
- Nope, I have it.

162
00:10:03,968 --> 00:10:07,263
I know it's kind of weird,
your bandmate dating your ex and...

163
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:08,978
No, it's fine.

164
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:11,063
I knew he was gonna move on.

165
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:13,484
Not with the bass player,
didn't see that coming.

166
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:15,921
But it's rock and roll,
so, it's fine.

167
00:10:16,507 --> 00:10:18,279
So, we're cool?

168
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,281
Yeah, totally.

169
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,137
I hope you're putting some
money on Villanova.

170
00:10:33,307 --> 00:10:35,140
Villanova, really?

171
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:37,484
I've been on a roll lately.

172
00:10:38,752 --> 00:10:40,517
All right, Villanova it is.

173
00:10:40,684 --> 00:10:42,902
After all, you are
my good luck charm.

174
00:10:43,349 --> 00:10:44,898
And if I win, we can split it.

175
00:10:45,262 --> 00:10:46,392
When we win...

176
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,976
I'll take you to that Lakers
game on sunday to celebrate.

177
00:10:50,488 --> 00:10:51,897
I'd love to.

178
00:10:52,357 --> 00:10:55,597
But unfortunately, I won't
be here sunday. I have to head home.

179
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:58,152
- Already?
- I gotta get back to work.

180
00:10:58,413 --> 00:11:00,285
I have responsibilities.

181
00:11:00,642 --> 00:11:03,431
When you emailed, I dropped
everything and came running.

182
00:11:03,971 --> 00:11:05,057
That's cool.

183
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:07,156
I tell you what,

184
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:09,669
tomorrow, we can come here for
one final celebration.

185
00:11:10,094 --> 00:11:12,533
Watch the game and
wait for our ship to come in.

186
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,475
That sounds great.

187
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,779
I want you to watch the tape,

188
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:33,854
and you'll see the flaw
in your mechanics.

189
00:11:34,114 --> 00:11:37,358
You look at the flaws. I want
to relive that 135-mile-an-hour serve.

190
00:11:38,446 --> 00:11:40,778
- See you tomorrow, man.
- See you later.

191
00:11:42,088 --> 00:11:43,614
What's going on with us?

192
00:11:43,985 --> 00:11:45,283
So much for small talk.

193
00:11:45,544 --> 00:11:47,326
I know why you're acting all weird.

194
00:11:48,754 --> 00:11:50,538
I was a jealous, paranoid freak.

195
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:55,701
But what I don't know is
if my jealous, paranoid freakiness

196
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:57,870
is something that you can get over

197
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,214
or it's something that you can't.

198
00:12:01,694 --> 00:12:03,009
I don't know, either.

199
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:06,011
I want to be with someone
who trusts me.

200
00:12:06,273 --> 00:12:07,059
I do.

201
00:12:08,611 --> 00:12:09,557
Now.

202
00:12:09,818 --> 00:12:12,177
Until I get a call,
or run into someone from my past.

203
00:12:12,347 --> 00:12:13,811
Come on, that is not true.

204
00:12:15,156 --> 00:12:16,536
I made a mistake.

205
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:18,676
And I'm really sorry.

206
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,180
But the unfortunate thing here

207
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,156
is that I can't prove to you that
I'm not gonna do it again unless you...

208
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,491
Unless you give me another chance.

209
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:30,372
So, how about it?

210
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,637
What the hell is... wrong with you?

211
00:12:58,807 --> 00:13:01,832
- Nothing kicking your ass won't fix.
- Kicking my ass?

212
00:13:02,002 --> 00:13:03,595
Stop it!

213
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:07,476
What is going on?
Are you okay, Jeffrey?

214
00:13:07,646 --> 00:13:08,558
I'm fine.

215
00:13:08,728 --> 00:13:11,160
He was hiding.
He came out and took a sucker punch...

216
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,121
'Cause I saw you coming out of the BW,
making out with some bimbo.

217
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,250
What?!

218
00:13:21,827 --> 00:13:23,464
You are a bastard.

219
00:13:24,145 --> 00:13:25,148
I can explain!

220
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:27,338
I don't wanna hear
anything you have to say!

221
00:13:28,805 --> 00:13:31,039
Sweetheart, I can explain.

222
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,774
Colleen!

223
00:14:02,586 --> 00:14:04,004
You've been avoiding me.

224
00:14:04,728 --> 00:14:07,675
No, I've just been really
busy with the band and stuff.

225
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,218
I don't blame you.

226
00:14:09,478 --> 00:14:11,303
I put you in a really bad position.

227
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,382
But your friendship means
more to me than anything.

228
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:15,975
I don't want to lose that.

229
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,227
Me, neither.

230
00:14:18,695 --> 00:14:22,398
So can we just pretend like
I never told you about my stupid crush

231
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:25,313
and just go
back to the way things were?

232
00:14:26,229 --> 00:14:28,863
- What crush?
- Great, 'cause I have lots to tell you.

233
00:14:29,123 --> 00:14:30,281
Me, too.

234
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:32,439
- Did you hear about Pete Duffy?
- What?

235
00:14:32,609 --> 00:14:34,882
- He singed his eyebrows off.
- Once it gets out

236
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:38,137
that I have been dealt a
grave injustice by Cannon,

237
00:14:38,307 --> 00:14:41,584
I'm sure the student body
will demand I get my job back.

238
00:14:42,634 --> 00:14:44,553
I wouldn't hold
your breath on that one.

239
00:14:44,723 --> 00:14:46,793
Come on, you
witnessed my humiliation.

240
00:14:46,963 --> 00:14:49,126
We agree that he wasldn't
hold out of line.

241
00:14:49,558 --> 00:14:51,546
No, "eh"!
He was totally out of line.

242
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:54,721
He didn't pick on anyone but me.
They go for the weakest of the herd.

243
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:56,296
Weakest of the herd?

244
00:14:56,466 --> 00:14:59,240
I've heard you called many a thing,
but that would be a first.

245
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,324
I know this isn't
what you want to hear,

246
00:15:01,494 --> 00:15:03,604
but you were the one out of line.

247
00:15:03,774 --> 00:15:06,901
I cannot believe you're
taking his side!

248
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,764
Will you kindly remind Silver

249
00:15:11,934 --> 00:15:15,177
what a jerk Mr. Cannon was
this morning at the Blaze meeting?

250
00:15:15,521 --> 00:15:17,282
I don't think he was the jerk.

251
00:15:17,452 --> 00:15:19,576
What is wrong with you people?

252
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:21,742
It's like we were at two
different meetings.

253
00:15:21,912 --> 00:15:24,034
I was at the one
where you wouldn't shut up.

254
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,420
You're won't get
a lot of support on this one.

255
00:15:26,681 --> 00:15:27,838
I should!

256
00:15:28,099 --> 00:15:29,627
Because that guy

257
00:15:30,184 --> 00:15:31,949
is a total douchebag!

258
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:36,624
You're not blowing this out of
proportion a little bit?

259
00:15:36,794 --> 00:15:37,681
I'm not!

260
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,981
Do you know what
he said to me... mr. Cannon?

261
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:43,524
He said if I wanted
back on the Blaze,

262
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:45,963
I had to sleep with him!

263
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:48,150
What?!

264
00:15:51,121 --> 00:15:52,746
That's sexual harassment.

265
00:15:53,045 --> 00:15:54,153
No kidding.

266
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,409
So, can I finally get your
support against this guy?

267
00:15:58,629 --> 00:15:59,550
Sure.

268
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,913
Oh, my God.

269
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:18,346
I got my tools.

270
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:21,653
I'll leave the boat for now,
maybe I can come back for it later.

271
00:16:21,823 --> 00:16:23,769
I hope so but if not, I can deal.

272
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,355
I just had a long talk with Jeffrey.

273
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:29,231
Don't worry.

274
00:16:29,651 --> 00:16:31,860
We've survived
a lot worse than this.

275
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,454
We'll be okay on our own. I'll
get an after-school job, if you need.

276
00:16:35,624 --> 00:16:37,968
- You don't have to do that.
- I'd do anything for you.

277
00:16:38,138 --> 00:16:39,827
I know, and I appreciate that.

278
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:46,438
Jeffrey and I have our issues,
I won't deny that.

279
00:16:47,052 --> 00:16:49,871
But you don't just walk out
when things are going bad,

280
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,297
you work through it.

281
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:54,925
I know it's not what
you were expecting,

282
00:16:55,441 --> 00:16:57,027
but please understand.

283
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:01,732
Liam, say something.

284
00:17:03,141 --> 00:17:05,047
I've got nothing to say to you.

285
00:17:21,066 --> 00:17:22,652
It's so romantic.

286
00:17:24,262 --> 00:17:26,665
- They're totally...
- meant for each other, I know.

287
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:30,798
I love this scene.

288
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:32,652
Sorry.

289
00:17:32,822 --> 00:17:34,214
No, please, after you.

290
00:17:34,863 --> 00:17:36,013
Go for it.

291
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:54,466
I'm not saying I'm not athletic.

292
00:17:54,636 --> 00:17:58,321
I never really sparked
to traditional sports, per se.

293
00:17:58,488 --> 00:18:00,143
Except for dodgeball.

294
00:18:00,624 --> 00:18:02,843
I was always pretty
good at dodgeball.

295
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:04,063
Is that so?

296
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:06,586
Whatever I lacked in
hand-eye coordination,

297
00:18:06,756 --> 00:18:08,381
I made up for in rage.

298
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:14,428
Are you in the
mood for some dessert?

299
00:18:14,788 --> 00:18:17,053
I wish I could-
I gotta get back to the Blaze.

300
00:18:17,223 --> 00:18:19,009
They have this really interesting...

301
00:18:23,823 --> 00:18:24,848
Long time.

302
00:18:25,903 --> 00:18:28,435
- Tara, this is Silver.
- It's nice to meet you.

303
00:18:28,695 --> 00:18:29,695
You, too.

304
00:18:30,148 --> 00:18:31,522
Tara and I used to date.

305
00:18:32,093 --> 00:18:34,096
Did you? That's cool.

306
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:35,781
You know what?

307
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:39,410
I have passes to a screening for the new
Tarantino film. You guys want to come?

308
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,705
Silver has to get back
to school... now, actually.

309
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:44,941
But, I'm free.

310
00:18:46,004 --> 00:18:47,839
Unless, that's not cool with you.

311
00:18:48,218 --> 00:18:51,166
Me? No,
of course, it's totally cool.

312
00:18:51,426 --> 00:18:54,171
Great! Don't worry,
I'll take care of the check.

313
00:18:55,732 --> 00:18:56,876
Thank you.

314
00:18:57,046 --> 00:18:58,882
All right, it was nice to meet you.

315
00:18:59,142 --> 00:19:00,050
You, too.

316
00:19:00,785 --> 00:19:02,302
You guys have fun.

317
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,097
How have you been?

318
00:19:05,357 --> 00:19:09,148
- So funny bumping into you today.
- I know, tonight sounds great!

319
00:19:10,952 --> 00:19:13,768
Emergency meeting at the
blaze tomorrow afternoon.

320
00:19:13,935 --> 00:19:15,785
Be there, big announcement!

321
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:24,432
It's Naomi. So, emergency meeting
tomorrow afternoon.

322
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:28,106
I will call you back.

323
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:30,369
What's wrong?

324
00:19:36,946 --> 00:19:38,385
What's going on?

325
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,135
I caught my stepdad
cheating on my mom.

326
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:42,749
Sorry.

327
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,720
You know what really sucks?

328
00:19:47,806 --> 00:19:49,229
She's staying with him.

329
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:52,156
I know exactly what you're feeling.

330
00:19:52,965 --> 00:19:56,115
My mom put up with that same
crap from my dad for...

331
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,300
ever.

332
00:19:59,008 --> 00:20:00,532
I still don't get why.

333
00:20:06,296 --> 00:20:09,044
- Do you min I crash here tonight?
- Not at all.

334
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:11,126
Tonight, tomorrow,
as long as you want.

335
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,230
I've been thinking about you.

336
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,816
How's the whole stepdad situation?

337
00:20:34,148 --> 00:20:35,150
Not great.

338
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,196
- I really need to talk to you.
- Not now.

339
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,324
- Please, it's important.
- It's fine.

340
00:20:42,788 --> 00:20:44,238
I'll see you later.

341
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:47,658
Can you just give me
five minutes, please?

342
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:50,266
- I'm gonna be late for class.
- Three minutes, one minute?

343
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:52,668
Come on, what's 60 seconds
out of your damn life?

344
00:20:53,082 --> 00:20:54,332
Don't touch me.

345
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:57,297
Come on, please, I'm sorry.
I just... come talk to me.

346
00:20:58,256 --> 00:20:59,306
I love you.

347
00:21:01,035 --> 00:21:02,035
Damn it.

348
00:21:17,894 --> 00:21:19,570
<i>It's Dixon.
Leave a message.</i>

349
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:23,405
It's me. I was just wondering
where you are.

350
00:21:23,644 --> 00:21:25,535
I thought we were
meeting at the house.

351
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,709
Maybe I got it wrong.

352
00:21:28,168 --> 00:21:31,068
You know, I'll just meet
you at the restaurant.

353
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,112
And after all that he goes,

354
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:38,929
"you don't mind
if I go with Tara, right?"

355
00:21:39,142 --> 00:21:41,842
- It's obvious what he's doing.
- Bonding that Tara chick?

356
00:21:43,588 --> 00:21:45,387
- Wrong answer.
- Testing me.

357
00:21:45,897 --> 00:21:47,297
I'm not buying it.

358
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,059
Knock, knock!
I wanted to bring you both a flyer

359
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:53,604
for our band's gig.
I hope you can make it.

360
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,108
- Wouldn't miss it for the world!
- "The glorious steinems"?

361
00:21:58,727 --> 00:22:00,085
"Live at the beach club."

362
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,634
What is a steinem?
That disease you get in your eye?

363
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:04,968
Beats me.
They had the name when I joined.

364
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:06,575
Are you guys kidding?

365
00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:08,332
Glorious Steinems?

366
00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:09,745
Gloria Steinem?

367
00:22:10,687 --> 00:22:13,548
Come on, she's only one of
the most important feminists.

368
00:22:13,715 --> 00:22:15,518
Editor and publisher
of miss Magazine.

369
00:22:15,685 --> 00:22:17,753
You know what a steinem is,
it's a beer mug.

370
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,974
Yes, that is totally it.

371
00:22:21,522 --> 00:22:23,508
Can I talk to you
guys about something?

372
00:22:23,758 --> 00:22:25,552
- Something complicated?
- Talk.

373
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,805
Complicated's my second language.

374
00:22:34,915 --> 00:22:37,689
So, Gia told me she
has a crush on me.

375
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,708
How did you handle it?

376
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,947
At first, I totally freaked out
and completely avoided her.

377
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,158
And then, I got over it.

378
00:22:49,617 --> 00:22:51,741
And now... I don't know.

379
00:22:52,396 --> 00:22:55,499
We have this really
great connection.

380
00:22:56,092 --> 00:22:59,255
And last night, I started thinking
about it, about her.

381
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:02,000
Not as a friend, you know?

382
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,507
Really?

383
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,440
We were watching this romantic
scene in a movie and...

384
00:23:08,772 --> 00:23:11,640
I kind of just stopped watching
the movie, started thinking about Gia.

385
00:23:12,629 --> 00:23:13,931
And I don't know why.

386
00:23:14,098 --> 00:23:16,812
Maybe I'm just trying
to rebound since Navid.

387
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,840
But...

388
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,651
Like, I know I need to move on. I didn't
think I'd be moving on with a girl.

389
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,194
- Until now.
- Crafty!

390
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,756
A little lady-lady action
might be just the thing

391
00:23:26,923 --> 00:23:29,302
to get the persian stallion back
in your stable.

392
00:23:29,469 --> 00:23:31,382
Seriously, guys, what do you think?

393
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:34,871
If I'm having these feelings for a girl,
does that mean I'm gay?

394
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,584
It's a little gay.

395
00:23:40,856 --> 00:23:42,962
- What? It is.
- I don't know,

396
00:23:43,475 --> 00:23:46,043
I don't think sexuality
is black and white.

397
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:48,508
It's more of, like a spectrum.

398
00:23:48,907 --> 00:23:52,415
There are some people
who are 100% gay, or 100% straight...

399
00:23:52,582 --> 00:23:55,392
That's true. Gay guys, straight guys,
they all want to sleep with me.

400
00:23:55,989 --> 00:23:59,980
But honestly, I think most of us
fall somewhere in the middle.

401
00:24:00,436 --> 00:24:01,982
It depends on where we are

402
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,317
and who we're open to
falling in love with.

403
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:07,905
- At least, that's what Kinsey found.
- I'd actually make a good gay icon.

404
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:11,116
- Think about it. Cher, Liza...
- you know, the important thing,

405
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,952
just don't get caught up the labels.

406
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,420
How does Gia make you feel?

407
00:24:17,273 --> 00:24:20,000
- Really happy.
- Like more than "friendship happy"?

408
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,544
I think so.

409
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:44,527
Drinking chai?

410
00:24:45,603 --> 00:24:49,529
That's very interesting, I'm sure you
hear what they say about chai drinkers.

411
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,364
No, what do they say?

412
00:24:51,974 --> 00:24:55,424
They say that they're very
possessive about their papadum.

413
00:24:59,143 --> 00:25:02,667
So, tell me, how are things going
with Dixon's birth mom?

414
00:25:04,887 --> 00:25:07,297
- That good?
- I feel like a horrible person.

415
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,549
You're not horrible.

416
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:10,842
You're human.

417
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,804
How can you not feel conflicted
with her being here?

418
00:25:24,707 --> 00:25:26,358
Thank you.

419
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,736
For everything.
For listening to me vent,

420
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,148
for understanding
where I'm coming from.

421
00:25:32,315 --> 00:25:33,470
Of course.

422
00:25:33,637 --> 00:25:36,576
You say of course, but believe me,
that's not what I'm getting at home.

423
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,495
You should be.

424
00:25:39,025 --> 00:25:40,497
You deserve it.

425
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:56,555
- What are you doing?
- I misread your signal. I'm sorry.

426
00:25:57,197 --> 00:25:59,099
That should not have happened.

427
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,520
I'm married. I've gotta go.

428
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,723
I didn't see you today.

429
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:16,901
I was just wondering,
is everything okay?

430
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:18,368
Just laying low.

431
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:19,953
Wicked hangover.

432
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,788
From a Tarantino movie?

433
00:26:22,562 --> 00:26:24,166
Tara and I blew that off.

434
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,756
I woke up on a chaise,
covered in sand,

435
00:26:26,923 --> 00:26:30,376
with a headache like it was the
morning after st. Paddy's day.

436
00:26:31,954 --> 00:26:34,801
- That sounds like a lot of fun.
- Yeah, it was.

437
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,053
Anyway, gotta get back on the court.

438
00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:39,169
Bye.

439
00:26:50,618 --> 00:26:51,618
It's open.

440
00:26:54,109 --> 00:26:56,698
What happened today?
I thought we had plans.

441
00:27:00,187 --> 00:27:02,204
Guess I forgot. My bad.

442
00:27:05,005 --> 00:27:07,105
Are you upset cause I'm leaving?

443
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:11,736
You'd think I'd be
used to that by now.

444
00:27:11,903 --> 00:27:13,298
You know it's not for good.

445
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:14,883
Whatever.

446
00:27:18,459 --> 00:27:20,355
Listen, this last week,

447
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:24,602
reconnecting with you,
it has been amazing.

448
00:27:28,906 --> 00:27:31,608
I want to be a part of your life.

449
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,905
Why should I believe you?

450
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,494
If you wanted me to be
a part of your life so bad,

451
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:42,452
why have you never
reached out to me?

452
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,606
Not once, not ever!

453
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,171
Even now, I had to contact you.

454
00:27:47,884 --> 00:27:50,919
You're my mother!
It's not supposed to be like that.

455
00:27:54,499 --> 00:27:57,801
I didn't contact you because
I didn't want to disrupt your life.

456
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:04,100
But that didn't stop me from
thinking about you every single day.

457
00:28:08,009 --> 00:28:10,009
You were always in my prayers.

458
00:28:10,973 --> 00:28:11,973
Always.

459
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,825
You gotta believe me.

460
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:21,308
And all this time...
I thought you'd moved on.

461
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:23,719
Never.

462
00:28:25,712 --> 00:28:26,962
You're my baby.

463
00:28:28,819 --> 00:28:31,159
I want to be a...
A part of your life.

464
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:36,005
All right? And I promise as much as
you want me around, I'll be around.

465
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,634
There comes a time

466
00:28:58,428 --> 00:29:00,488
when we are called
to a higher power.

467
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,241
When the little people wake up

468
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:06,828
and realize, together,
we're a big person.

469
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:09,039
Together, we can fight

470
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,489
the tyranny that would control us.

471
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:16,296
We must speak up now,
or forever hold our peace.

472
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,549
She's kind of a smorgasbord
of metaphors there, isn't she?

473
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:23,149
But suffice it to say,
I have been mistreated by cannon.

474
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,155
So, we, the people,

475
00:29:25,322 --> 00:29:28,808
must protest and demand
I be reinstated

476
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:33,274
and that cannon be sent back
to that godforsaken nerd-nest.

477
00:29:36,395 --> 00:29:37,442
What's going on?

478
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,903
Cannon kicked me off the blaze,

479
00:29:41,026 --> 00:29:44,565
so we are striking
until I'm allowed back on.

480
00:29:44,732 --> 00:29:48,382
- We've got to get an edition by friday.
- Tough tatas, honey.

481
00:29:48,911 --> 00:29:50,538
Union! Union! Union!

482
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,775
Stop! Look, all right.

483
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,794
Everyone, okay?

484
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,919
Let me just go talk to mr. Cannon

485
00:29:58,086 --> 00:30:00,298
and see if I can get him
to give you another chance.

486
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,285
- Okay?
- Fine.

487
00:30:04,898 --> 00:30:07,348
I will see you at
1300 hours tomorrow.

488
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,390
I believe that's lunch period.

489
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:25,740
So, Dixon tells me
you're leaving us...

490
00:30:26,447 --> 00:30:28,201
I gotta get back to work.

491
00:30:29,183 --> 00:30:31,633
- It's been nice having you.
- Thanks.

492
00:30:35,505 --> 00:30:38,605
This is awkward, but,
I need to tell you something.

493
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:43,263
Yesterday, I went to the restaurant
to meet Dixon.

494
00:30:43,857 --> 00:30:46,607
And I saw you at a cafe
with a handsome man.

495
00:30:48,866 --> 00:30:52,316
Yesterday? Right, you know,
that was my yoga teacher.

496
00:30:53,954 --> 00:30:57,103
That's a rather close student/teacher
relationship you have there.

497
00:30:57,963 --> 00:30:59,435
It's not what you think.

498
00:30:59,602 --> 00:31:02,253
That kiss was a mistake,
on his part.

499
00:31:02,825 --> 00:31:05,159
I was completely shocked
and taken aback,

500
00:31:05,326 --> 00:31:07,365
I told him so
and no on certain terms

501
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:10,383
I'm going to tell Harry everything
the minute he gets home.

502
00:31:10,825 --> 00:31:12,662
Are you sure that's a good idea?

503
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,681
What do you mean?

504
00:31:16,854 --> 00:31:19,661
I mean, I've been around you two.
There's a little tension.

505
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,381
And jealousy, it's the number one
killer of relationships.

506
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,842
Believe me, I used to
temp for a divorce lawyer.

507
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,642
I think that this is

508
00:31:28,588 --> 00:31:30,338
probably a family matter.

509
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,060
Family matters always trickle down

510
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,687
to the kids, you know,

511
00:31:38,304 --> 00:31:40,454
One of your kids I gave birth to.

512
00:31:42,665 --> 00:31:44,865
Anyways, that's just my two cents.

513
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:48,242
You have a great family.

514
00:31:48,889 --> 00:31:50,089
Don't risk it.

515
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:03,247
Picked up a couple more dvd's
on the way over.

516
00:32:03,414 --> 00:32:07,418
But, sexual behavior in the human
female seems a lot more interesting.

517
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,135
I'm confused.

518
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:14,965
If sexuality is on a spectrum,

519
00:32:15,514 --> 00:32:17,769
does that mean that most
people choose to be straight

520
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,467
because it's what they know
or what they're used to?

521
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:21,814
Maybe some people do.

522
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,776
What does that mean?
That being gay is a choice?

523
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:27,445
Because I definitely
don't believe that's true.

524
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:30,333
I don't think it's a choice
for a lot of people.

525
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,346
As far back as I can remember,
I've liked girls.

526
00:32:33,513 --> 00:32:35,828
But that doesn't mean
that everyone's like that.

527
00:32:36,851 --> 00:32:37,830
Some people

528
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,083
might fall somewhere in the middle.

529
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:41,899
That makes sense.

530
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:46,381
Then again, everything I'm reading makes
sense until it doesn't make sense, so...

531
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,642
Why are you reading those?

532
00:32:58,597 --> 00:32:59,597
'cause...

533
00:33:02,405 --> 00:33:03,405
Because...

534
00:33:04,812 --> 00:33:06,150
I think I like you.

535
00:33:10,929 --> 00:33:12,615
Whatever you're struggling with,

536
00:33:13,413 --> 00:33:16,369
I don't think you're gonna find
the answer in one of these books.

537
00:33:16,967 --> 00:33:18,017
No kidding.

538
00:33:18,684 --> 00:33:20,537
So, how do I figure it out?

539
00:33:29,927 --> 00:33:30,927
We could

540
00:33:31,506 --> 00:33:32,969
kiss, and, I don't know...

541
00:33:34,563 --> 00:33:35,913
See how you feel.

542
00:33:39,971 --> 00:33:41,894
That sounds like a good idea.

543
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:07,833
Good or

544
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:09,319
gross?

545
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:11,314
Good.

546
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:14,719
- You're a good kisser.
- I don't get a lot of complaints.

547
00:34:20,293 --> 00:34:21,706
But was it,

548
00:34:22,805 --> 00:34:24,773
something you liked and

549
00:34:25,495 --> 00:34:27,145
got out of your system?

550
00:34:28,055 --> 00:34:30,777
Or something you liked
and want to do again?

551
00:34:32,562 --> 00:34:34,412
Something I wanna do again.

552
00:34:37,691 --> 00:34:39,243
So, what does that mean?

553
00:34:40,518 --> 00:34:42,468
Just that you kind of dig me.

554
00:34:43,486 --> 00:34:45,936
And that if I asked you out
on a date,

555
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,919
you'd probably say yes.

556
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,740
So, you wanna go out on a date?

557
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:03,643
That would be a yes.

558
00:36:01,798 --> 00:36:03,601
All right, you're right.

559
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:07,415
You said I was jealous and I am, okay?
You win.

560
00:36:09,553 --> 00:36:12,336
I tried to tell you, but you were like,
"I can handle this."

561
00:36:12,586 --> 00:36:13,586
Whatever.

562
00:36:16,036 --> 00:36:17,701
I'm sorry, I just don't get it.

563
00:36:17,868 --> 00:36:20,607
You make this huge play
to be with me and then now

564
00:36:20,774 --> 00:36:23,390
now you're willing to throw it
all away cause I made one

565
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:26,100
incredibly stupid jealous mistake.

566
00:36:26,466 --> 00:36:27,766
What's going on?

567
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:30,521
I don't know, I just...

568
00:36:31,237 --> 00:36:32,387
I don't know.

569
00:36:34,103 --> 00:36:36,552
What if it wasn't a mistake?
What if you're right?

570
00:36:37,175 --> 00:36:38,421
What do you mean?

571
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:41,609
I didn't have to go
to that coffeehouse.

572
00:36:41,776 --> 00:36:45,286
I could've emailed her, but instead
I left the door wide open.

573
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:47,663
Yeah, but nothing happened.

574
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:49,332
It could have.

575
00:36:50,105 --> 00:36:52,369
Anything could happen
to anyone at any moment.

576
00:36:52,536 --> 00:36:54,128
I'm not just anyone.

577
00:36:55,405 --> 00:36:57,305
I'm Spence Montgomery's son.

578
00:36:58,558 --> 00:37:01,052
My dad's had four wives
and cheated on all of them.

579
00:37:02,603 --> 00:37:03,971
You're not your father.

580
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:05,771
How do you know?

581
00:37:06,235 --> 00:37:09,852
I don't know. I've never cared enough
about a girl to stay faithful before.

582
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,622
But I care about you a lot.

583
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:19,904
And I'd hate myself if
I ever cheated on you.

584
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:26,467
I trust you.

585
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,194
Now, I'm warning you, I'm not good
with this emotional stuff.

586
00:38:01,754 --> 00:38:04,866
Where you think you get that from?
It is genetic.

587
00:38:07,707 --> 00:38:10,371
All right, I'll call you.
I promise. Every week.

588
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,921
Yeah, and maybe we can skype
and watch a game together.

589
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:17,820
Okay, I'm not sure
what that means, but...

590
00:38:18,271 --> 00:38:19,573
Sounds like fun.

591
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:22,467
I almost forgot.

592
00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:28,633
What's this?

593
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,141
We won the bet.

594
00:38:30,664 --> 00:38:32,523
That's your half, plus a little

595
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:36,431
something extra to make up for all
the missed birthdays and Christmases

596
00:38:36,598 --> 00:38:38,598
and sits from the tooth fairy.

597
00:38:50,526 --> 00:38:51,704
I'll see you, son.

598
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:21,541
You know where all my shirts went?

599
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:24,708
**** for a little while,
you should have a drawer.

600
00:39:25,033 --> 00:39:25,905
Thank you.

601
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:29,628
All my drawers were filled,
I cleared you space underneath the bed.

602
00:39:29,795 --> 00:39:30,826
You are sweet.

603
00:39:32,282 --> 00:39:34,205
I like playing house
underneath with you...

604
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,268
Really?

605
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:39,168
This is a little awkward.

606
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,338
You watching us?

607
00:39:43,845 --> 00:39:44,845
Sorry.

608
00:39:45,251 --> 00:39:48,051
We just want to talk to you
about Mr. Cannon.

609
00:39:48,654 --> 00:39:50,331
That. Don't worry,

610
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:54,009
it's all good. Navid talked to him;
he's agreed to let me back on the Blaze.

611
00:39:54,176 --> 00:39:55,309
Isn't that great?

612
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,515
Yeah, I guess,
except for everything he said.

613
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,816
That stuff was awful.

614
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:03,241
You really can't let him
get away with it.

615
00:40:03,508 --> 00:40:05,481
With what? What'd he say to you?

616
00:40:05,648 --> 00:40:06,904
It's nothing, honey.

617
00:40:07,276 --> 00:40:09,031
No, I want to know what happened.

618
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,729
Cannon told her that
she could be back on the Blaze

619
00:40:11,896 --> 00:40:13,496
if she slept with him.

620
00:40:14,024 --> 00:40:16,700
- What?!
- It's okay. I got what I wanted.

621
00:40:16,867 --> 00:40:19,333
- Let's all just forget about it.
- Forget about it?

622
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,545
You can't let him get away with this.
It's sexual harassment.

623
00:40:23,642 --> 00:40:26,090
Come on. You gotta come forward.

624
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,990
You don't want to be a doormat,
like both of our mothers were.

625
00:40:37,211 --> 00:40:39,190
You've reached Liam Leave a message.

626
00:40:40,726 --> 00:40:41,777
It's Annie.

627
00:40:41,944 --> 00:40:45,815
I just wanted to check in and,
see how you're doing.

628
00:40:45,982 --> 00:40:48,671
Cause we didn't get a chance
to talk earlier.

629
00:40:48,838 --> 00:40:50,915
If you need anything, call me.

630
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,193
I told you to leave me alone.

631
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,795
What do I have to do
to get that through your head?

632
00:41:05,634 --> 00:41:08,569
Don't worry, I got the
message loud and clear.

633
00:41:09,716 --> 00:41:11,343
I just wanted to say good-bye.

634
00:41:12,075 --> 00:41:13,775
Are you going somewhere?

635
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,797
You could say that.

636
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:20,226
Listen, if I can't be with you,

637
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:22,873
there's no point in living.

638
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:24,356
Bye, Annie.

639
00:41:25,002 --> 00:41:26,502
Jasper, no, don't...
