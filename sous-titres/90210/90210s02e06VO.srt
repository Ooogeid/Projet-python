<i>Previously...</i>

00:00:01,923 --> 00:00:04,985
That homeless guy that was killed?
His nephew goes here. That's him.

3
00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:07,716
- Come take a ride with me.
- I'll go for a ride with you.

4
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:09,796
- I'm married.
- Why didn't you tell me?

5
00:00:09,963 --> 00:00:13,624
There's more. When I told
you my money was tied up in Europe,

6
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:16,094
that wasn't exactly true.

7
00:00:16,354 --> 00:00:18,305
The truth is that I'm broke.

8
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,433
What were you planning to do?
Live off me forever, Jen?

9
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:27,772
- You shouldn't have done that.
- This guy... no longer a virgin.

10
00:00:28,032 --> 00:00:31,247
She just came back from Beach Club,
and she could not keep her hands off me.

11
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,267
What do you care
who I make out with?

12
00:00:33,437 --> 00:00:35,614
- You've got a boyfriend.
- Kiss whoever you want.

13
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,602
I wanted to be here

14
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:41,620
so that I could tell my mother
to stay away from me.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,872
Your mom called me.
She told me...

16
00:00:44,282 --> 00:00:46,082
She has cancer, Silver.

17
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,670
Did you remember the Cilantro?
Please say yes,

18
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:16,655
cause I'm dying to try this new
recipe and it's not going to taste

19
00:01:16,822 --> 00:01:18,685
- like anything without...
- I didn't.

20
00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:20,177
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,162
What?

22
00:01:26,382 --> 00:01:28,907
I should tell you something,
but I think...

23
00:01:31,807 --> 00:01:35,465
I don't know if I should tell you or
if I should tell her to tell you or...

24
00:01:35,725 --> 00:01:37,467
What are you talking about?
Come on.

25
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,781
Sit down.

26
00:01:39,063 --> 00:01:40,326
Tell me.

27
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:45,767
It's about Mom.

28
00:01:46,763 --> 00:01:48,294
What about her?

29
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,469
She has...

30
00:01:53,134 --> 00:01:54,317
She has cancer.

31
00:01:55,955 --> 00:01:57,612
- She's dying.
- What?

32
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:01,921
I ran into her at an AA meeting
when I went with Ade,

33
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:04,430
and she wanted to talk to me,
to make up with me.

34
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,538
I told her to leave me alone.

35
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,191
Actually, I told her to "drop dead."

36
00:02:09,554 --> 00:02:11,735
I didn't know what was going on.

37
00:02:11,905 --> 00:02:13,940
She told Ade, and Ade told me.

38
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,119
And I was dying to tell you,
but I thought maybe she would tell you.

39
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:18,680
I'm sure she wouldn't.

40
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,224
I made it clear that I never
wanted to talk to her again.

41
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,756
Me, too. But...

42
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,931
now everything's different, right?

43
00:02:25,342 --> 00:02:26,558
We should call her.

44
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,975
What should we do?

45
00:02:32,723 --> 00:02:33,732
Nothing.

46
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:36,393
We...
do nothing.

47
00:02:37,008 --> 00:02:38,491
Nothing's different.

48
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,822
I'm sorry that she's sick.

49
00:02:41,082 --> 00:02:42,372
I am. But...

50
00:02:43,668 --> 00:02:45,952
we can't get sucked back
into that woman's drama.

51
00:02:46,212 --> 00:02:47,827
- It's not drama...
- Yes, it is.

52
00:02:47,994 --> 00:02:49,529
With Mom, it always is.

53
00:02:53,504 --> 00:02:54,753
Listen to me.

54
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,578
I want you to think about
everything that she's done,

55
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,466
all the ways that she has hurt you.

56
00:03:01,106 --> 00:03:02,908
Just because someone's sick...

57
00:03:03,078 --> 00:03:04,387
doesn't change the past.

58
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:08,892
Promise me that you won't
get sucked back in?

59
00:03:12,315 --> 00:03:13,461
I promise.

60
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:25,938
Who cares how much money
these blockbusters make?

61
00:03:26,108 --> 00:03:28,037
They're insidious.
They're killing cinema.

62
00:03:28,204 --> 00:03:30,265
Kubrick. Tarkovsky.
Bunuel.

63
00:03:30,435 --> 00:03:32,499
Where are these masters today?
Where are they?

64
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:34,870
Bunuel, Bunuel...

65
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,212
he directed Alvin
and the Chipmunks, right?

66
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,426
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:40,798 --> 00:03:43,218
I know I take this
all too seriously.

68
00:03:43,478 --> 00:03:45,633
Are you kidding?
You're passionate.

69
00:03:45,803 --> 00:03:47,555
It's awesome.
It's great.

70
00:03:48,751 --> 00:03:51,309
It makes me a pretty popular
character around here, too.

71
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,211
Who cares what these idiots think?

72
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:54,813
I'm impressed.

73
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,417
You're just nice.

74
00:03:58,493 --> 00:03:59,814
I think you're nice.

75
00:03:59,984 --> 00:04:01,444
I think you're very nice.

76
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:09,464
How would you feel
about taking a "very nice" girl

77
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:13,414
along with you the next time
you went to the cinema.

78
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,625
I'd feel good about it.

79
00:04:18,034 --> 00:04:21,756
There's something playing at the
Egyptian in a couple of days.

80
00:04:22,176 --> 00:04:23,275
Sounds good.

81
00:04:26,477 --> 00:04:29,035
Isn't that your booty call with Mr.
Columbine?

82
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:31,832
Homeboy got dumped for that guy?
That's pitiful.

83
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:35,542
- It's also kind of funny.
- Shut up, you douche.

84
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:38,849
Am I supposed to keep
tabs on every stupid hook up?

85
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:41,920
It's cool. No shame in
sharing your candy with Jasper.

86
00:04:55,807 --> 00:04:58,052
I enjoyed our evening
the other night.

87
00:04:58,222 --> 00:05:01,251
The moonlit ride, dinner
in the orchard.

88
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:05,755
My chef is famous for
his white truffle omelets,

89
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,469
but he only serves
them at breakfast.

90
00:05:10,191 --> 00:05:13,407
If I'm ever up early and
in the neighborhood, I'll drop by.

91
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,935
Still the stubborn, bucking filly?

92
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:21,065
Just not that kind of girl.

93
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:32,055
Continental Accent.

94
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:35,907
Impeccable bloodlines.
Five generations of champions.

95
00:05:37,023 --> 00:05:38,147
He's for sale.

96
00:05:38,556 --> 00:05:39,862
He's magnificent.

97
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:41,775
And he could be worth a fortune.

98
00:05:42,273 --> 00:05:44,375
With his earnings potential
at the race track?

99
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,256
And his years of stud work after?

100
00:05:46,426 --> 00:05:48,301
There is no limit how
much he could make.

101
00:05:53,888 --> 00:05:55,391
Look who's here, again.

102
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:58,061
Have a wonderful ride, ladies.

103
00:06:04,481 --> 00:06:06,694
Are you enjoying your Juan Peron?

104
00:06:07,393 --> 00:06:09,210
Let's just say, I'm enjoying access

105
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,491
to the finest riding
estate within 50 miles.

106
00:06:17,174 --> 00:06:19,168
I have some good news.

107
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:22,152
- I've started my divorce proceedings.
- That's great.

108
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,231
It's all thanks to your advice.

109
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,294
We just need to send in
a deposit to retain the lawyer.

110
00:06:27,461 --> 00:06:29,222
It's a little over
a hundred thousand.

111
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:32,502
- Ideally, by Thursday.
- Isn't that kind of a lot?

112
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:36,003
I've seen divorces
advertised on TV for $200.

113
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:39,477
I don't want a TV lawyer.
The prenup is pretty solid.

114
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,439
I'm sorry, you signed a prenup?

115
00:06:45,898 --> 00:06:48,027
Which is why I need
an excellent lawyer.

116
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:51,294
If he can show that Olivier
violated the marital contract

117
00:06:51,464 --> 00:06:55,027
by celebrating adultery,
the French national pastime,

118
00:06:56,193 --> 00:06:58,651
then he can prove I'm entitled
to a share of his assets.

119
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:02,413
But if he can't, I'm just out
a hundred thousand dollars.

120
00:07:02,684 --> 00:07:06,504
- I'm footing the bill here. Not you.
- How many times you'll throwing that?

121
00:07:07,012 --> 00:07:09,590
Someone needs to be responsible
about money, Jen.

122
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,302
You know what? I don't need financial
counsel from a trust-fund brat.

123
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:15,555
You're one to talk.
You haven't worked a day.

124
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,943
We're a little different.
I went to Yale.

125
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:20,665
You didn't graduate.

126
00:07:20,835 --> 00:07:23,563
You threw yourself at some
rich guy's feet like it was 1957.

127
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:26,858
Now you're offering me romantic advice?
That's a laugh.

128
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,336
You couldn't even keep your
little high school James Dean happy.

129
00:07:43,465 --> 00:07:44,751
The shrimp looks good.

130
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:47,805
The wild Alaskan salmon is in.

131
00:07:47,972 --> 00:07:50,244
I'm thinking shrimp,
then I always get shrimp.

132
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:52,710
Does that make me boring
and predictable?

133
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,886
No, silly.
Get what you want.

134
00:08:04,738 --> 00:08:06,064
Look, Ade...

135
00:08:06,742 --> 00:08:09,734
I feel like things have been
a little off between us.

136
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:15,051
But it's okay. Going back to school
and putting the acting on the side...

137
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:18,124
that's been a big shift for you.
I totally get that.

138
00:08:19,047 --> 00:08:21,525
It's like the tectonic
plates have shifted.

139
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,373
But you and me,
we're earthquake proof.

140
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,760
Am I blabe*** too much?

141
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:40,807
No, I'm listening.

142
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,045
And I'm reading this amazing
book by Frank Lloyd Wright,

143
00:08:44,212 --> 00:08:46,187
and I'm totally obsessed
with architecture.

144
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:49,784
We have to go to the B.A. Center, check
out the Hollyhock and Ennis Houses

145
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,532
- when the renovations are complete.
- Stop!

146
00:08:53,584 --> 00:08:55,613
- I can't do this.
- What?

147
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,196
This. Us.

148
00:08:59,398 --> 00:09:00,993
I can't do it anymore.

149
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:08,905
What are you talking about?

150
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:11,087
I can't be your girlfriend.

151
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,632
These last few months have been a blur,
and maybe you're right.

152
00:09:14,892 --> 00:09:17,710
Maybe it's just been all too much.

153
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:20,837
Not acting, losing my agent.

154
00:09:21,836 --> 00:09:23,864
I am so overwhelmed.

155
00:09:25,862 --> 00:09:28,024
I need to figure out who I am

156
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:30,273
before I'm just become
Navid's girlfriend.

157
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:34,026
I need some time alone.

158
00:09:39,786 --> 00:09:41,279
We need to break up.

159
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,750
Oh, my God.

160
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:52,614
I am so sorry.

Saison 02 Episode 06
<i>Umasked</i>

163
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,094
I was like,

164
00:10:17,924 --> 00:10:19,262
"I might get shrimp,"

165
00:10:19,432 --> 00:10:22,131
and then she's like,
"Wild Alaskan salmon, that's in."

166
00:10:22,301 --> 00:10:24,939
And then I said,
"Maybe I shouldn't get the shrimp.

167
00:10:25,109 --> 00:10:28,140
Maybe that's boring."
And then she said, "No, silly."

168
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:31,834
She always called me "silly."

169
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:35,593
What's up, guys?
I'm sorry I'm late.

170
00:10:35,763 --> 00:10:38,066
- Wilshire was a parking lot.
- Cut up to Beverly.

171
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:41,010
Would you shut up about the traffic?
I'm dying here.

172
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:45,163
I'm sorry, bro.

173
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:52,115
Nice place you got here, man.

174
00:10:52,857 --> 00:10:53,857
Thanks.

175
00:10:56,682 --> 00:10:58,139
What's under this tarp?

176
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,821
Nothing. Just don't...

177
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,230
Don't touch that.
Are you guys hungry?

178
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,063
I got sandwich stuff in the house.
My mom made some kind of cake

179
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:07,847
if you want dessert.

180
00:11:15,082 --> 00:11:17,445
Screw dessert.
Why don't we grab a couple of six packs,

181
00:11:17,615 --> 00:11:19,924
head down to the beach,
take your mind off it?

182
00:11:20,184 --> 00:11:23,469
I don't want to. I want to figure
it out 'cause it doesn't make any sense.

183
00:11:24,443 --> 00:11:27,759
I was at the restaurant
and I sat down and I was like,

184
00:11:28,741 --> 00:11:30,025
"I might get the shrimp"

185
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:32,976
and then she was like "Yeah,
"wild Alaskan salmon, that's in."

186
00:11:33,146 --> 00:11:35,147
And then I said "Maybe
shrimp's boring."

187
00:11:49,964 --> 00:11:52,814
<i>Just broke up with Navid...
Guess now I'm free</i>

188
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:02,177
<i>[...] Guess now I'm alone</i>

189
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:09,120
<i>Envoyer</i>

190
00:12:15,906 --> 00:12:19,066
<i>So when R we hanging out?</i>

191
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:34,905
Please tell me how you deal
with those brats all day long.

192
00:12:35,075 --> 00:12:38,722
It's not easy. Especially now
that caning is politically incorrect.

193
00:12:39,602 --> 00:12:40,629
Naomi troubles?

194
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:43,215
Can you disown a sibling?

195
00:12:44,971 --> 00:12:46,383
She drives you nuts,

196
00:12:46,553 --> 00:12:48,512
but it's just because
you guys are so close.

197
00:12:50,885 --> 00:12:52,808
You know you're all she's got.

198
00:12:53,396 --> 00:12:55,019
She's lucky to have you.

199
00:12:56,017 --> 00:12:57,651
Are you going to be a gentleman

200
00:12:57,821 --> 00:13:00,191
and help me off with these?

201
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:02,974
I was considering it
but then I thought,

202
00:13:03,144 --> 00:13:05,643
"What if I helped her off
with everything but the boots?"

203
00:13:05,813 --> 00:13:08,666
And I gotta say,
it wasn't the worst image.

204
00:13:10,461 --> 00:13:12,396
You don't hear me complaining.

205
00:13:14,523 --> 00:13:17,083
And with her signature,
impeccable timing.

206
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,675
- There's Naomi.
- Who has changed her name to

207
00:13:20,845 --> 00:13:22,192
"Eduardo."

208
00:13:24,642 --> 00:13:26,133
This is our time together.

209
00:13:26,393 --> 00:13:30,127
Besides, Eduardo's gotta learn
that I'm not always available to him.

210
00:13:34,217 --> 00:13:35,335
What?

211
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,454
- You're upset.
- No. I love being in the loop

212
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,009
and hearing your strategies
for juggling guys.

213
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:43,471
- It's a real aphrodisiac.
- Please.

214
00:13:43,892 --> 00:13:45,775
You can't possibly be jealous.

215
00:13:45,945 --> 00:13:47,738
Obviously,
we're dating other people.

216
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:50,901
Sure.

217
00:13:54,743 --> 00:13:56,085
Where were we?

218
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:17,433
What's up?

219
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:18,905
Nothing much.

220
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:23,193
I was thinking, we haven't really
hung out that much since Teddy's party.

221
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,183
And yet the world is still
spinning around somehow.

222
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,576
I never meant to hurt you
with that sext.

223
00:14:30,242 --> 00:14:34,106
I showed it to a couple of friends,
and that was lame and I'm really sorry.

224
00:14:34,276 --> 00:14:35,968
- Really sorry.
- Thanks.

225
00:14:36,138 --> 00:14:38,666
The real jerk
in this whole thing is Naomi.

226
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,916
She's the one that sent it.
She's a bitch.

227
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:43,154
Can't argue that.

228
00:14:43,324 --> 00:14:45,528
So, do you think
maybe, I don't know,

229
00:14:45,698 --> 00:14:47,381
we could hang out sometime?

230
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:53,429
Are you seeing somebody?

231
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:54,847
Maybe.

232
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:58,767
Whatever.
As long as it's not that Jasper dude.

233
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:02,104
And what's wrong with Jasper?

234
00:15:02,364 --> 00:15:03,481
You don't know?

235
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:07,693
The guy's a psycho. He pulled
a knife on a guy last spring.

236
00:15:07,953 --> 00:15:09,612
I'm sure that's just gossip.

237
00:15:09,872 --> 00:15:11,214
No, it's not.

238
00:15:11,851 --> 00:15:14,450
Jasper is a seriously messed up guy.

239
00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:20,086
I'd be careful if I were you.

240
00:15:29,036 --> 00:15:31,717
There you are!
When are we gonna have our lunch?

241
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:35,881
Harry, hi.
How are things?

242
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:38,092
Good. Are we playing
hide-and-go-seek?

243
00:15:38,262 --> 00:15:40,012
Because I found you, you're it,

244
00:15:40,182 --> 00:15:42,019
and I feel like
you've been avoiding me.

245
00:15:43,262 --> 00:15:46,482
No, I've just been really busy
with midterms and, college counseling.

246
00:15:47,497 --> 00:15:49,068
What about tomorrow for lunch?

247
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,570
- That's no good for me.
- Next day?

248
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,234
Let me check.
I will look.

249
00:15:56,404 --> 00:15:58,499
But I have to go to a thing, so...

250
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:00,807
I'll shoot you an email.

251
00:16:17,738 --> 00:16:20,307
- I'm here to see my mother.
- You must be Silver.

252
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:23,352
My name's Mindy.
I'm one of your mom's nurses. Come in.

253
00:16:27,591 --> 00:16:29,024
I'm glad you're here.

254
00:16:29,194 --> 00:16:32,235
Your mother's going to need support
from her family during this time.

255
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:34,458
- We have a visitor!
- Who is it?

256
00:16:41,907 --> 00:16:43,539
I just knew you'd come.

257
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:55,152
- Three months?
- That's just a guess.

258
00:16:55,978 --> 00:16:57,604
No one really knows these things.

259
00:16:57,774 --> 00:17:00,264
But I wouldn't buy any theatre
tickets for much after that.

260
00:17:00,434 --> 00:17:01,682
There's no Stage V.

261
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:05,686
You haven't touched your tea.

262
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:10,190
I don't really drink tea.
Just coffee.

263
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,026
Get out. Really?
Since when?

264
00:17:12,286 --> 00:17:14,028
I don't know, four years?

265
00:17:17,183 --> 00:17:20,480
- I can get you some coffee.
- Don't worry about the coffee.

266
00:17:21,837 --> 00:17:23,370
When did they find the cancer?

267
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:25,414
Last year.

268
00:17:25,674 --> 00:17:27,413
I did everything they told me.

269
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,182
Stopped drinking.
Tried my damndest, anyway.

270
00:17:30,352 --> 00:17:32,884
Had the lump removed,
did the chemo and all that.

271
00:17:33,054 --> 00:17:34,282
For what?

272
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:40,888
But I guess they didn't get it all,
and by now it's spread everywhere.

273
00:17:41,587 --> 00:17:44,145
All I know is that
the "tick, tick, tick"

274
00:17:44,315 --> 00:17:47,230
just gets louder each day.

275
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:53,336
When I laid into you
at your meeting,

276
00:17:54,664 --> 00:17:56,445
I didn't know that you were so sick.

277
00:17:58,204 --> 00:18:00,866
You had every right
to say those things.

278
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:04,146
I was such a lousy mother.

279
00:18:05,087 --> 00:18:08,416
If I could go back and
change the past, I would.

280
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,204
But all I can do now
is focus on the present.

281
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:14,546
It's all I have.

282
00:18:14,806 --> 00:18:15,829
That's good.

283
00:18:16,893 --> 00:18:18,133
I's not too late.

284
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:23,972
Maybe we can even hang out a little.

285
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:26,195
I'd like that.

286
00:18:28,271 --> 00:18:29,538
Do you think...

287
00:18:30,532 --> 00:18:31,594
Would you...

288
00:18:32,393 --> 00:18:33,399
What?

289
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:36,914
Will you move back home?

290
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,488
It'd mean the world to me.

291
00:18:50,668 --> 00:18:51,975
Can I join you for lunch?

292
00:18:52,823 --> 00:18:55,687
And before you answer,
you should know that I haven't asked

293
00:18:55,854 --> 00:18:58,996
one person that in the past two
miserable years here.

294
00:18:59,163 --> 00:19:02,015
I've actually got this
chem quiz to study for.

295
00:19:02,857 --> 00:19:06,353
That's okay. I eat super quietly,
it's almost freakish.

296
00:19:06,908 --> 00:19:10,023
You know,, I'd rather eat alone.

297
00:19:10,273 --> 00:19:12,160
- Are you okay?
- I'm just busy.

298
00:19:12,327 --> 00:19:15,935
- What about the Egyptian later?
- I totally forgot.

299
00:19:16,102 --> 00:19:18,991
I signed up for peer tutoring, and
it starts today, so I gotta cancel.

300
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:22,092
- Okay, well, maybe...
- Some other time.

301
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:33,944
What? I was counting on you, man.
I gotta get out there and meet somebody,

302
00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:36,442
and now my wingman's bailing
on me at the last second?

303
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,480
That's, that's cold, brother.

304
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:40,929
I'm just saying, first rule of the
wingman's handbook:

305
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:45,035
Don't bail on your pilot.
Yeah, all right, later.

306
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:49,605
Sounds like somebody
needs a wingman.

307
00:19:50,673 --> 00:19:54,443
We were just, making a vague
future sort of plan.

308
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:57,574
I was a primo
wingman back in the day.

309
00:19:57,741 --> 00:19:59,735
And I wouldn't mind
getting out of the house.

310
00:19:59,902 --> 00:20:02,336
Blowing off a little steam.
Knocking back a few frosties.

311
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:03,595
Frosties?

312
00:20:03,762 --> 00:20:07,176
Brewskies, my friend. Bitter batters?
Barley pops,

313
00:20:07,343 --> 00:20:09,641
brain hammers,
the real man's Zima...

314
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:11,919
- I could go on.
- No, I think I got it.

315
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:18,512
Now, the first round is on <i>moi.</i>

316
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,008
I got your text.

317
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:49,285
Thanks for coming.
I know it was short notice and all.

318
00:20:50,175 --> 00:20:51,709
Okay, here's the thing.

319
00:20:52,656 --> 00:20:54,962
I've been feeling sick
about our fight the other day.

320
00:20:55,912 --> 00:20:57,674
Oh, thank God.
Me, too.

321
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:00,509
When we're not getting
along, I can't function.

322
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,718
I couldn't focus
at all in class today.

323
00:21:02,885 --> 00:21:05,238
You're not just my baby sister.
You're my best friend.

324
00:21:05,405 --> 00:21:08,275
And stupid things like money
should never get in the way of that.

325
00:21:08,442 --> 00:21:10,936
- Totally.
- Which is why

326
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,938
I've decided to move out.

327
00:21:13,474 --> 00:21:14,481
What?

328
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,882
That's crazy.
Don't be...

329
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:19,695
Just while I figure out
this divorce thing.

330
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:24,312
- What are you gonna do for money?
- Oh, I'll make do.

331
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:26,743
Besides, you'll be better off.

332
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:29,246
You don't need me around,
spending all your money

333
00:21:29,841 --> 00:21:31,441
and dragging you down.

334
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,673
Let's see here,
should we order an appetizer?

335
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,282
I want to enjoy this place
while I'm still a member.

336
00:21:53,953 --> 00:21:56,273
I was wondering,
since she wasn't in class,

337
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,733
if I could give you a Humanities
handout for Silver.

338
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,389
It's just a short story
and a couple of essay questions.

339
00:22:01,556 --> 00:22:03,099
She wasn't in class?

340
00:22:03,351 --> 00:22:05,991
I think Adrianna said something about
Silver taking

341
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,691
your mother
to a doctor's appointment.

342
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:11,501
I will make sure she gets it.

343
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:13,453
Thanks.

344
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,722
I guess Silver told you.

345
00:22:31,008 --> 00:22:32,392
Pretty crazy, right?

346
00:22:34,342 --> 00:22:35,896
How you feeling?

347
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,231
Much better now that you're here.

348
00:22:40,185 --> 00:22:41,652
I'm sorry I didn't call you.

349
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,365
I just thought, with all
the terrible things I did

350
00:22:44,532 --> 00:22:45,544
Please, don't.

351
00:22:46,145 --> 00:22:48,584
- I need to say this.
- No, you don't, okay?

352
00:22:48,751 --> 00:22:50,975
What happened between us,
it happened.

353
00:22:51,142 --> 00:22:52,592
We can't change it.

354
00:22:53,863 --> 00:22:54,863
I know.

355
00:22:56,818 --> 00:22:59,753
The only reason I came here was
to tell you to leave Silver alone.

356
00:23:00,308 --> 00:23:01,308
What?

357
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,080
She's bipolar, Mom.

358
00:23:03,975 --> 00:23:07,135
She's doing really well right now.
We're doing really well.

359
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,385
I know.

360
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,807
I want to be a part of it.
Try to be a mother

361
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:14,476
- while I still can.
- Fine. Be one.

362
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,680
Mothers want what's best
for their children.

363
00:23:16,847 --> 00:23:19,847
What's best for Silver is
that you leave her alone.

364
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:44,023
Sorry, I don't sign
autographs until game day.

365
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,490
I just wanted to thank you
for warning me about Jasper.

366
00:23:48,247 --> 00:23:50,762
No worries.
I do owe you, right?

367
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:55,630
Look, I meant what I said.
I'm really sorry.

368
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,255
So, what, so, you're not
gonna go out with him?

369
00:24:05,842 --> 00:24:07,083
So, you're single,

370
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:08,613
you're alone?

371
00:24:08,863 --> 00:24:11,650
It's not like I'm some kind
of a leper or anything,

372
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,804
but, no, I'm not dating anybody.

373
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:16,621
- Are you doing anything tonight?
- Not really.

374
00:24:16,871 --> 00:24:19,916
Me, neither. Do you want to maybe
hang out together?

375
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:25,209
- What the hell, right?
- Yeah, what the hell.

376
00:24:41,721 --> 00:24:44,416
So, just put your account number
and your new billing address

377
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,831
at the top right hand corner,
and we'll have this...

378
00:24:46,998 --> 00:24:47,998
Jen, stop.

379
00:24:52,438 --> 00:24:54,701
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

380
00:24:55,186 --> 00:24:57,913
I am not letting money drive a wedge
between me and my best friend.

381
00:25:06,013 --> 00:25:07,265
Thank you.

382
00:25:09,997 --> 00:25:13,220
Now, go take that cheating-frog
ex-husband for all he's worth, okay?

383
00:25:24,182 --> 00:25:25,906
Perfect score from the judges.

384
00:25:26,073 --> 00:25:28,500
Thank you. There's only one judge
I care about.

385
00:25:28,852 --> 00:25:31,162
Extra-perfect scores from her.

386
00:25:38,715 --> 00:25:41,331
- I'm having the best day with you.
- Me, too.

387
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,945
Kissing you and not feel like
we're doing something wrong.

388
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:47,170
I know, I know.

389
00:26:07,761 --> 00:26:10,661
You shouldn't be standing outside.
Let's go in.

390
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:13,443
I'm sorry, Silver. I had no right
to ask you to move in.

391
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,631
I have no right to
ask anything of you.

392
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:18,702
Kelly's right. I...
I should leave you alone.

393
00:26:19,057 --> 00:26:21,830
When she first showed up,
I was hurt, but she's right.

394
00:26:22,555 --> 00:26:23,555
I'm sorry.

395
00:26:24,843 --> 00:26:26,193
I will stay away.

396
00:26:39,902 --> 00:26:41,752
I have a cute girl for you.

397
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:46,975
You know that Starbucks
on Olympic near the school?

398
00:26:47,142 --> 00:26:51,146
There's a barista there, works in
the morning, redhead wears her hair up?

399
00:26:51,313 --> 00:26:53,995
She sing your drink orders
in an opera voice?

400
00:26:54,162 --> 00:26:56,738
<i>Two nonfat, extra-foam double caps.</i>

401
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,451
- I know who you mean.
- And?

402
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,061
I want to murder
that woman in the span of time

403
00:27:03,228 --> 00:27:06,417
- it takes her to place my drink order.
- Somebody's a diva.

404
00:27:08,508 --> 00:27:11,463
I have got to drain the lizard.
Let's keep spitballing.

405
00:27:13,484 --> 00:27:15,579
<i>Another round, please.</i>

406
00:27:21,622 --> 00:27:22,849
So, who's your friend?

407
00:27:23,862 --> 00:27:26,436
He's not a friend. They just,
let him out of the institution.

408
00:27:29,295 --> 00:27:32,150
If you can lose him,
I'm just right over there.

409
00:27:38,653 --> 00:27:40,003
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

410
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:48,452
You know the French lady that came to
talk about the semester abroad program?

411
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:50,062
You know the one?

412
00:27:50,229 --> 00:27:52,592
- With the withered hand?
- You're such a diva.

413
00:28:03,981 --> 00:28:07,471
It's so strange. You know, like,
ever since that night at the party,

414
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:10,228
even though I hadn't
seen you in years,

415
00:28:10,395 --> 00:28:12,983
it's like we just picked up,
like we'd never been apart.

416
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,043
I know. I feel the same way.

417
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,660
Even though
you were with another guy,

418
00:28:18,776 --> 00:28:20,762
it didn't seem like you were.

419
00:28:23,182 --> 00:28:26,362
You know, I really don't want
to hurt Navid anymore.

420
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,476
So maybe for a while, we just

421
00:28:29,643 --> 00:28:32,093
keep our relationship
on the down low.

422
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:33,995
Relationship?

423
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,723
Relationships are just...

424
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,495
You now, they're just not my thing.

425
00:28:43,323 --> 00:28:47,073
- So, you don't want to...
- Don't take everything so seriously.

426
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,453
Oh, my gosh.

427
00:28:53,172 --> 00:28:55,722
We can still have
a great time together.

428
00:28:57,595 --> 00:28:58,995
I'm such an idiot.

429
00:29:12,356 --> 00:29:15,587
How can you be depressed all the time?
Snap out of it.

430
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,611
- We're back on Annie now?
- Little Miss Mopey, that's right.

431
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:21,405
She's in high school,
for Pete's sake.

432
00:29:21,572 --> 00:29:24,364
I don't know. I think high school
can be pretty rough for some.

433
00:29:24,531 --> 00:29:25,581
Oh, please.

434
00:29:26,415 --> 00:29:30,398
Poor kids... they have it so rough
with all the daily grind and

435
00:29:30,893 --> 00:29:33,177
- the peer pressure...
- Wait. So this is Deb, again?

436
00:29:33,344 --> 00:29:36,149
Who is now totally in a huff with me
about how to raise the kids.

437
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:40,380
At least before, you know, I could go
to school and vent, but...

438
00:29:40,547 --> 00:29:41,965
But this is Kelly again.

439
00:29:42,132 --> 00:29:44,866
Who now hides every time
I come around the corner.

440
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,160
- Well, imagine that.
- What?

441
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,660
Nothing. Go on.

442
00:29:48,827 --> 00:29:50,760
I don't know. It's just,
we used to be...

443
00:29:50,927 --> 00:29:53,127
We used to be best buds, you know?

444
00:29:55,022 --> 00:29:56,836
I mean, what is it the kids say?

445
00:29:57,565 --> 00:29:59,388
<i>Awkward!</i>

446
00:30:12,624 --> 00:30:14,412
I've been calling for dinner.

447
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,513
- I'm eating alone tonight.
- But I made...

448
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,739
How dare you talk to Mom
about me behind my back!

449
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,995
I'm sorry. I just...

450
00:30:24,374 --> 00:30:27,367
I think it's best if you
don't get involved with her.

451
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,035
She's dying, Kelly.

452
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:32,660
Don't you get that?
Don't you care about her at all?

453
00:30:34,022 --> 00:30:36,422
It's not that I don't care
about her.

454
00:30:37,345 --> 00:30:39,003
It's that I really care about you.

455
00:30:39,253 --> 00:30:42,079
I can make decisions
for myself, you know.

456
00:30:42,246 --> 00:30:43,591
I can take care of myself.

457
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:45,718
Frankly, you can't.

458
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:47,387
Excuse me?

459
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:49,687
You're bipolar.

460
00:30:51,356 --> 00:30:54,201
Not that that's a bad thing.
It's just a thing, okay?

461
00:30:54,368 --> 00:30:57,081
You are different.
You can't handle intense stuff,

462
00:30:57,248 --> 00:30:59,732
and Jackie is intense.
What she's going through is intense.

463
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,443
It's going to bring up stuff

464
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,612
that you shouldn't even be thinking
about or dealing with, trust me.

465
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:07,987
You can't decide what kind of relation
ship I can have with my dying mother.

466
00:31:08,506 --> 00:31:12,462
Yes, I can. I'm your guardian,
and I'm the one who takes care of you.

467
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,763
Now come in to dinner.

468
00:31:24,766 --> 00:31:27,395
I wouldn't have called you,
but I was just losing my mind, man.

469
00:31:27,562 --> 00:31:31,462
Going over every second of every day,
just trying to figure it out.

470
00:31:31,629 --> 00:31:33,079
And then it hit me.

471
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:40,148
What do you mean?

472
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:43,082
You've known her longer than anyone.

473
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:46,613
Of course, right.

474
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,589
So, what's your take here?
What do you think could have happened?

475
00:31:50,998 --> 00:31:52,841
I don't know.
People are...

476
00:31:53,642 --> 00:31:55,715
- Complicated.
- I tried talking to Ade

477
00:31:55,882 --> 00:31:58,723
but I got nothing. It's like
she's trying to hide something.

478
00:31:59,729 --> 00:32:02,295
Don't let your imagination
go crazy on you.

479
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:04,834
All I can guess is,
I let her down somehow,

480
00:32:05,001 --> 00:32:08,120
and she doesn't want to hurt me
even more by telling me what I did.

481
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:12,556
- I don't know, man.
- All I know is that...

482
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,950
I'm dying here.

483
00:32:22,966 --> 00:32:24,566
Another lovely dinner.

484
00:32:26,831 --> 00:32:30,381
And the chances of it leading
to an even lovelier breakfast?

485
00:32:32,101 --> 00:32:34,166
You never give up, do you?

486
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:37,166
I've yet to meet a
horse I can't break.

487
00:32:38,908 --> 00:32:40,509
You know what?

488
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:41,851
I'm in.

489
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,719
You're spending the night?

490
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:47,631
I'm buying a racehorse.

491
00:32:48,012 --> 00:32:49,812
I want Continental Accent.

492
00:32:51,172 --> 00:32:53,471
It's an extremely risky business.

493
00:32:53,732 --> 00:32:55,431
Which is why it sounds fun.

494
00:32:55,699 --> 00:32:57,266
But why be impulsive?

495
00:32:57,532 --> 00:32:59,398
I would hate to see
you lose your money.

496
00:32:59,565 --> 00:33:01,199
Who's talking about my money?

497
00:33:01,588 --> 00:33:04,199
I've just received
a generous gift, and, well,

498
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:06,699
I have a spare hundred grand.

499
00:33:08,499 --> 00:33:10,671
- Sorry... forgot a blanket.
- That's okay.

500
00:33:11,266 --> 00:33:13,233
You want a glass of wine? Yeah.

501
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:16,327
Didn't really peg you
as a picnic basket guy.

502
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,398
My parents are
Hollywood Bowl fanatics,

503
00:33:18,565 --> 00:33:20,398
and they never go
without a full spread.

504
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:23,126
It's nice that you learned
from them.

505
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,877
I just took their basket.

506
00:33:25,127 --> 00:33:26,379
You stole their food?

507
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:29,927
They were seeing Barry Manilow tonight.
Anybody lame enough to see Barry Manilow

508
00:33:30,094 --> 00:33:32,694
- deserves what they get.
- You're awful.

509
00:33:34,664 --> 00:33:36,064
I'm such an idiot.

510
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:40,799
I had a perfect life, and
I completely sabotaged it.

511
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:47,166
I just lost the love of my life.

512
00:33:49,749 --> 00:33:52,735
- What am I going to do without Navid?
- Enough with the self-pity.

513
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:54,741
This just happened, Ade.

514
00:33:55,807 --> 00:33:59,579
It's not like he's gone off to war
or married some wealthy duchess.

515
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,748
You can still fix this.

516
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,249
You really think I can?

517
00:34:04,966 --> 00:34:06,836
He's a great guy, granted.

518
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,422
But it's Navid, not George Clooney.

519
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,316
It's not like he's moved on
or anything.

520
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:23,300
Wingman surrendering his keys,
pilot, sir.

521
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,786
I don't really know how they talk.

522
00:34:25,953 --> 00:34:27,553
I think you nailed it.

523
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:34,489
- Call me.
- What, me or him?

524
00:34:43,925 --> 00:34:47,460
Whatever, skank.
Silver, Adrianna, follow me.

525
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:03,017
God, Annie, you are so hot.

526
00:35:03,873 --> 00:35:05,687
We're a little exposed out here.

527
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,024
We're okay. Unless someone's flying
into LAX super low.

528
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,699
Worse case, we'll just
give them a thrill.

529
00:35:14,366 --> 00:35:16,906
We should probably
start thinking about getting home.

530
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:19,659
Oh, come on.
Don't be a tease.

531
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,959
I'm not being a tease.
I'm just ready to leave.

532
00:35:22,126 --> 00:35:24,271
- It's still early. Come on.
- No, seriously.

533
00:35:24,438 --> 00:35:26,958
What is the big deal?
Don't be a prude.

534
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:31,170
Your lips are saying no,
but your body says yes.

535
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:33,999
Mark, get off of me.
I mean it.

536
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,313
Take one step near either of us,
and I'm calling the cops.

537
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,158
Hope I didn't scare you back there,
jumping out and all.

538
00:36:26,325 --> 00:36:28,340
No, please.
I'm so glad you did.

539
00:36:29,017 --> 00:36:30,017
I just...

540
00:36:30,562 --> 00:36:33,472
I don't know...
when I saw you guys leaving together,

541
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:36,569
- I had a bad feeling.
- Well, thanks.

542
00:36:39,206 --> 00:36:41,006
Will you tell me one thing?

543
00:36:41,173 --> 00:36:44,240
What got you all weirded out
the other day in the cafeteria?

544
00:36:45,551 --> 00:36:48,540
That. Fully my fault.

545
00:36:49,556 --> 00:36:53,560
Honestly, I can't believe this, but
it's cause of something that Mark said.

546
00:36:54,163 --> 00:36:56,413
Get out.
That creep is dissing me?

547
00:36:57,115 --> 00:36:59,465
What did he say?
Wait, let me guess.

548
00:36:59,632 --> 00:37:02,192
"Man, that Jasper, don't trust him."

549
00:37:02,881 --> 00:37:04,965
 "He doesn't play football."

550
00:37:05,132 --> 00:37:08,832
"He doesn't hang up freshman
by their underwear. He's a freak."

551
00:37:11,073 --> 00:37:12,774
Something like that.

552
00:37:13,951 --> 00:37:16,192
He said you pulled
a knife on somebody.

553
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:17,473
What?

554
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:21,440
What a crock. I knew he'd make up
some outrageous lie,

555
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:23,781
but that, I did not expect.

556
00:37:24,824 --> 00:37:27,020
I got to give him props
for creativity, right?

557
00:37:31,731 --> 00:37:32,939
I know,...

558
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,088
that's what got you scared off.
But it's cool.

559
00:37:38,106 --> 00:37:39,807
Yeah, but I'm...

560
00:37:40,646 --> 00:37:42,296
I'm not scared off now.

561
00:37:58,136 --> 00:38:00,540
Now there's no room for
the cranberry juice.

562
00:38:00,976 --> 00:38:03,176
Your mom's magical hangover cure?

563
00:38:03,757 --> 00:38:06,143
- With cranberry juice.
- You know what, honey?

564
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,411
Let me take over for you, Harry.

565
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,753
- Knock yourself out.
- Perfect. Thank you, Kelly.

566
00:38:24,851 --> 00:38:25,895
A horse?

567
00:38:26,062 --> 00:38:28,640
You dragged me all the way
across town to show me a horse?

568
00:38:30,367 --> 00:38:33,378
Say hello to Continental Accent.

569
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:38,357
His sire was Liberty Ride and his dam,
Frou-Frou. Both great champions.

570
00:38:39,037 --> 00:38:40,854
Have you been doing mushrooms?

571
00:38:41,956 --> 00:38:42,987
He's mine.

572
00:38:44,246 --> 00:38:47,668
A gift from Eduardo.
And he is going to make me...

573
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,607
us... a lot of money.

574
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,707
Aren't you?

575
00:39:21,597 --> 00:39:22,797
Nice car Mark.

576
00:39:44,574 --> 00:39:46,573
I'd like to move in with you.

577
00:40:01,473 --> 00:40:03,073
I made a huge mistake.

578
00:40:04,891 --> 00:40:07,491
All that stuff about
wanting to be alone?

579
00:40:07,851 --> 00:40:10,440
I realize now that's
really not what I want.

580
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,998
And, yeah, I'm going through
some weird stuff right now, but...

581
00:40:15,328 --> 00:40:16,440
the truth is...

582
00:40:16,607 --> 00:40:18,941
is I want to go through it with you.

583
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,003
So that's what the truth is?

584
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,719
I thought it has something to do
with the fact that you kissed Teddy.

585
00:40:36,832 --> 00:40:39,473
Whatever Silver told you,
I can totally explain.

586
00:40:40,001 --> 00:40:43,140
You know what? You don't have
to explain anything, all right?

587
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:49,480
And, Silver didn't tell me.
Teddy did.

588
00:40:51,128 --> 00:40:52,248
Wait, please.

589
00:40:52,565 --> 00:40:54,452
I want nothing more to do with you.
