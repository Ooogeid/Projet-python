1
00:00:01,244 --> 00:00:02,961
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:05,075
- Finn Court, please.
- <i>Not here.</i>

3
00:00:05,242 --> 00:00:07,549
- Excuse me?
- <i>Checked out about an hour ago.</i>

4
00:00:07,927 --> 00:00:09,789
You really should
be a little nicer to me

5
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:12,304
now that I'll be
handling your finances.

6
00:00:12,714 --> 00:00:15,682
I know you can take this tennis
all the way. No more distractions,

7
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:18,101
no more girlfriends.
Break up with her, Teddy.

8
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,563
I believe in you, and to see you
all depressed and down on yourself,

9
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:23,773
it hurts... the worst
feeling in the world.

10
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:26,901
Seeing you happy-
that means everything to me.

11
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:30,444
A beautiful girl like you
doesn't have a boyfriend?

12
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:35,790
No, I don't.
There's no one, no special guy,

13
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:37,661
no one.

14
00:00:41,846 --> 00:00:43,606
What movie are we going to see?

15
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:46,638
Don't care, as long as it's not
some stupid pop culture piece of crap.

16
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:49,294
Just because something's popular
doesn't mean it's any good.

17
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:50,397
Sometimes,

18
00:00:50,564 --> 00:00:54,304
it's the exact opposite. Lots of people
like cigarettes, but they cause cancer.

19
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:58,312
- Any idea what he's talking about?
- Stupid pop culture cancer.

20
00:00:58,898 --> 00:01:01,445
- What is your problem?
- You want to know what my problem is?

21
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:04,603
You want to know what my problem is?
I'll show you.

22
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,691
This right here is my problem.

23
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:07,941
Javier?

24
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,106
Can you get out of here, please?!

25
00:01:10,273 --> 00:01:12,335
I'm tired of looking at his face!

26
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,019
Aren't you guys broken up?

27
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:17,535
I know that already.

28
00:01:20,901 --> 00:01:22,415
But maybe I don't want to be.

29
00:01:24,564 --> 00:01:26,753
Have you told Ade that
you ended it with Lila yet?

30
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,073
No, I didn't.

31
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,423
That's the first step:
you're supposed to tell her.

32
00:01:30,796 --> 00:01:32,884
And step two: let her
know you want her back.

33
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:36,304
And step three: cut a single,
become an overnight teen heartthrob.

34
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,641
Does he kiss like a teen
heartthrob or not?

35
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:40,950
I don't know. We've been on,
like, two dates.

36
00:01:41,117 --> 00:01:44,199
If you guys come to my gig on Friday,
you can meet him. He'll be there.

37
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:47,059
Ade, it's your first gig!
I'm so excited!

38
00:01:47,226 --> 00:01:48,900
Miss, do you have another card?

39
00:01:49,257 --> 00:01:50,966
This one's been declined.

40
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,741
Why were my cards declined?
Fix this, please.

41
00:01:57,521 --> 00:01:59,737
Let me take a look and see.

42
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,791
They don't work

43
00:02:05,616 --> 00:02:06,960
because I canceled them.

44
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:10,101
You've been spending entirely
too much money and,

45
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,763
you're on a financial diet now,

46
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,126
consisting
of low-denomination greens...

47
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:17,053
that's fives and tens,
little sister.

48
00:02:20,796 --> 00:02:23,852
Would you excuse me? I have to
sign a check for my shrimp vendor.

49
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,290
I'll ask if he's hiring.

50
00:02:36,543 --> 00:02:38,345
<i>Hi. This is Jay Boyd.</i>

51
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:40,153
I don't know a Jay Boyd.

52
00:02:40,918 --> 00:02:42,954
What are you doing?
That's my phone.

53
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:50,145
This really isn't a good time.
Can I call you back?

54
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:56,634
- What was that all about?
- None of your business.

55
00:02:57,014 --> 00:02:59,810
Now that I'm in charge,
things are going to change...

56
00:02:59,977 --> 00:03:01,328
a lot of things.

57
00:03:01,603 --> 00:03:03,687
Frugal is the new black.

58
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,304
Do you really have to go
to Australia all summer?

59
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:12,873
I'm gonna really miss you.

60
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:16,672
You should come.

61
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:18,907
To Australia?

62
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:21,409
If you wanted to.

63
00:03:22,463 --> 00:03:23,411
I want to.

64
00:03:24,198 --> 00:03:25,038
Really?

65
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,251
Yeah, I really want to.

66
00:03:38,246 --> 00:03:39,382
I've got an idea.

67
00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:43,555
What if we start our presentation by
playing Vivaldi for, like, ten minutes?

68
00:03:43,722 --> 00:03:47,470
Which means we'd only have to talk
about Vivaldi for, like, five.

69
00:03:47,637 --> 00:03:50,565
I think Matthews had something
a little more interactive in mind.

70
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:53,673
But we could do an interpretive
dance while the music plays...

71
00:03:54,982 --> 00:03:58,043
And I'm serious.
Bring the ballet slippers next meeting.

Season 02 Episode 21
Javianna

74
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,541
When did you get
out of the hospital?

75
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:32,814
Couple days ago.

76
00:04:33,517 --> 00:04:36,536
My doctors think I'm ready
to reintegrate into West Bev,

77
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:38,140
so here I am.

78
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,612
Reintegrating.

79
00:04:40,256 --> 00:04:41,590
That's great.

80
00:04:44,252 --> 00:04:45,578
- Are you...
- Better?

81
00:04:46,332 --> 00:04:47,237
Yeah.

82
00:04:47,404 --> 00:04:48,606
I feel better.

83
00:04:49,075 --> 00:04:52,208
Or at least I will, once I say
to you what I need to say...

84
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,936
There's no excuses for what I did.

85
00:04:57,241 --> 00:04:58,464
But I need to explain.

86
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:01,194
- You don't have to.
- I do.

87
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,449
I was always an outcast.

88
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:07,872
And then you came along.

89
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,648
And I saw how much my
uncle's death affected you,

90
00:05:11,815 --> 00:05:13,271
and I took advantage of that.

91
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,357
I didn't think I was gonna
fall in love with you.

92
00:05:18,524 --> 00:05:19,675
But I did.

93
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:24,040
And then, when you
threatened to leave me,

94
00:05:24,288 --> 00:05:25,366
I panicked.

95
00:05:28,972 --> 00:05:30,063
Whatever.

96
00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:32,015
I'm not here to make excuses.

97
00:05:32,182 --> 00:05:33,625
I'm here to apologize.

98
00:05:34,024 --> 00:05:36,165
You're one of the good ones, Annie.

99
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,228
If there's any way that
you can forgive me,

100
00:05:40,037 --> 00:05:42,471
- maybe we can be friends.
- Jasper, stop.

101
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:44,927
I can forgive you.

102
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,013
And I do.

103
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:48,615
You do?

104
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:52,334
But we can't be friends.

105
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:55,234
There's just too
much that's happened.

106
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,205
I understand.

107
00:05:58,904 --> 00:06:00,485
Thanks for listening to me.

108
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,418
What's the difference between
a big tennis practice and a regular?

109
00:06:12,585 --> 00:06:15,849
A big tennis practice comes
before a big tennis tournament.

110
00:06:16,016 --> 00:06:19,712
Which I'm gonna win, by the way,
earning myself #1 rankings in nationals.

111
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,495
- Hold your applause.
- I can't. Look. I can't.

112
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,366
Then, you better go.

113
00:06:24,745 --> 00:06:26,775
I should definitely go.

114
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:34,835
Go.

115
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:39,608
What?

116
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,363
Has Teddy dipped his pen in
the ol'inkwell recently?

117
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,604
- Dipped his pen...?
- Have you done the mattress mambo?

118
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:48,689
No, we have not had sex.

119
00:06:49,081 --> 00:06:50,952
But I want to. I really want to.

120
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:55,305
The only time I've ever done it,

121
00:06:55,472 --> 00:06:57,859
I was going through a manic phase.

122
00:06:58,348 --> 00:07:01,214
Now... I feel like
I'm a virgin again.

123
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:04,547
I just want it to
be right this time.

124
00:07:04,714 --> 00:07:07,468
But how do you know when
it's the right time?

125
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:10,054
I think you'll just know.

126
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:35,997
What are you doing here?

127
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:39,625
Every now and then I like to stop at
high schools and get a little ego boost.

128
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:43,227
I just wanted to see you.

129
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,135
Come. I have a special
night planned for us.

130
00:07:50,914 --> 00:07:52,998
I am really not dressed.

131
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,942
I had my assistant pick up a dress
and shoes.

132
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,226
I hope that's okay.

133
00:08:00,465 --> 00:08:01,977
Are you serious?

134
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,650
- Is that a yes?
- Yes. That's a yes.

135
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,653
- Let's go.
- This is amazing.

136
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,929
<i>Miss You.</i>

137
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:36,474
Thanks, man.

138
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,478
You're still pushing
your forehand a little.

139
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,774
Everyone's an expert
from the sidelines.

140
00:08:44,184 --> 00:08:45,305
But I know.

141
00:08:47,654 --> 00:08:50,071
You got a text from Silver.

142
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,201
Still having a little trouble
accepting it's over?

143
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,122
Actually, it's not.
Over.

144
00:08:59,493 --> 00:09:01,933
I thought we decided you
were breaking up with her.

145
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,877
You decided.
I decided I didn't want to.

146
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,267
I love her, Dad.

147
00:09:08,092 --> 00:09:09,557
I'm not breaking up with her.

148
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,685
You're not thinking straight. You got
to focus on your tennis right now.

149
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:16,347
I am focusing on my tennis.
I can do both.

150
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:22,643
- What?
- I don't know.

151
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:26,054
I thought you were different, that
you were going to be the one kid of mine

152
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:27,592
that was a success.

153
00:09:42,681 --> 00:09:44,419
Is this a good time?

154
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,460
- Sure.
- What's going on?

155
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,841
Ivy and her mom are going
to Australia this summer.

156
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,196
Just for some fun.

157
00:09:53,363 --> 00:09:56,220
- And, they invited me, so...
- Absolutely not.

158
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:00,556
Dixon doesn't deserve
a trip right now.

159
00:10:00,723 --> 00:10:02,894
What do you mean,
he doesn't deserve a trip?

160
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:05,819
I mean, he's not going.

161
00:10:05,986 --> 00:10:08,629
- Shouldn't this be a discussion?
- You know...

162
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:11,263
- It's okay.
- No. It's not okay.

163
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,762
I happen to think the trip sounds
like a really great opportunity

164
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:16,881
if there's parental supervision.

165
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,050
It's not gonna happen.

166
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,364
And in case you've forgotten,
I have a say in this, too.

167
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,666
Really, please...

168
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,595
- Just forget it.
- No. We're not going to forget it.

169
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:31,714
Your father and I will
discuss it like a couple.

170
00:10:33,877 --> 00:10:35,924
And then we will get back to you.

171
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:47,739
Javier?

172
00:10:55,683 --> 00:10:56,950
Where are you?

173
00:11:02,585 --> 00:11:04,313
Isn't this theater amazing?

174
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:06,539
Please, sit.

175
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,731
What's wrong? You okay?

176
00:11:54,124 --> 00:11:55,429
Yeah, I'm fine.

177
00:11:56,474 --> 00:11:58,550
Teddy, I don't think you're fine.

178
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,363
Come on. What's going on?

179
00:12:02,993 --> 00:12:04,298
It's my dad.

180
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,989
He is such an ass, I swear.

181
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:11,772
Sometimes the only place I feel
like I can breathe is here with you.

182
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:17,052
I mean it.

183
00:12:18,323 --> 00:12:20,183
You make me so happy, Silver.

184
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,531
Me, too.

185
00:12:22,886 --> 00:12:24,942
You make me so happy, too.

186
00:12:54,135 --> 00:12:55,649
I thought you wanted to wait.

187
00:12:56,096 --> 00:12:57,096
I did.

188
00:12:57,988 --> 00:12:59,143
Now I'm ready.

189
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:02,698
It just feels so right.

190
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,878
Can you believe Jen?

191
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,896
She sent my Mercedes back and is
making me drive that hunk of junk.

192
00:13:36,063 --> 00:13:38,812
There was a lot of smoke coming
from the exhaust. I'll take a look.

193
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:41,821
I'm poor, Liam.
What is there to live for?

194
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,280
I have to get my money back.
I have to.

195
00:13:44,447 --> 00:13:46,871
- I think Jay Boyd is the key.
- Who's he?

196
00:13:47,038 --> 00:13:50,042
I don't know. There's
a dozen Jay Boyds in the phone book,

197
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:53,290
I've to find the right one,
who made Jen all jittery and suspicious.

198
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,539
Or you could just wait until you
turn 18 when you get it back anyway.

199
00:13:56,706 --> 00:13:59,126
Are you insane? I can't live
like a pauper for six months.

200
00:13:59,293 --> 00:14:02,940
- Come on, you're not exactly a pauper.
- I can't shop. I can't spa.

201
00:14:03,107 --> 00:14:05,803
I might as well eat fast
food out of the trash can.

202
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:07,189
Come on.

203
00:14:07,702 --> 00:14:10,495
I cannot believe
you're being so unsympathetic.

204
00:14:10,907 --> 00:14:13,135
I need your support.
I need you to be here for me.

205
00:14:13,302 --> 00:14:15,271
You have got to be kidding me.

206
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:17,945
All I am is there for you.

207
00:14:18,314 --> 00:14:20,401
In fact, if anyone hasn't
been here, it's you.

208
00:14:20,802 --> 00:14:22,486
What are you talking about?

209
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,763
The fact that you have no idea what's
going on in my life for the last month,

210
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:26,740
none.

211
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:30,082
So for you to say
that I'm not there...

212
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,080
Whatever, Naomi.

213
00:14:43,803 --> 00:14:45,342
You ready for bangers and mash?

214
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:48,168
That's Australian for
sausage and hash browns.

215
00:14:48,453 --> 00:14:50,063
You better get used to the lingo,

216
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,599
because if you can come up
with the money for a ticket,

217
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:53,910
you are going.

218
00:14:55,015 --> 00:14:57,021
- To Australia?
- You got it, mate.

219
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:01,609
You going to talk
like that until I leave?

220
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,348
I'll give it a fair go.

221
00:15:04,956 --> 00:15:07,041
- Thanks, Mom.
- You're welcome.

222
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,549
Wait, why is everybody
staring at me?

223
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:14,363
I don't know.

224
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:18,083
Could have something to do with the limo
that pulled up to school yesterday.

225
00:15:18,468 --> 00:15:20,711
Which brings me to my next question.

226
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,528
Would you do an interview with
the Blaze about what it's like

227
00:15:23,695 --> 00:15:24,965
recording with Javier?

228
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:28,226
Lila was going to ask you to do the
story, but she's laying low on the Blaze

229
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:29,849
since the breakup with Navid.

230
00:15:30,168 --> 00:15:31,722
Wait, Navid and Lila broke up?

231
00:15:32,672 --> 00:15:33,909
- Yeah.
- When?

232
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,147
I don't know... like a week ago.

233
00:15:36,314 --> 00:15:37,978
Why wouldn't he tell me that?

234
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,939
Why would he tell you that?

235
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:43,514
You're right.
I guess there's no reason to...

236
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:47,086
What's going on?
Do you like Navid? Again?

237
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:50,032
It doesn't even matter.

238
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,583
No, it doesn't matter.

239
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,410
Navid and Lila have been
broken up for over a week

240
00:15:54,577 --> 00:15:57,227
and if he liked me,
he would have told me.

241
00:16:04,414 --> 00:16:05,967
Well, well, well.

242
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,994
If it isn't Mr. Hollywood Sign.

243
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,880
Welcome back.
Really,

244
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:13,681
we've all missed you.

245
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,642
Not me, but I'm sure
some junkies missed you.

246
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:21,098
They put a straitjacket
on your tongue in the nuthouse?

247
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,130
He is crazy.

248
00:16:23,488 --> 00:16:25,776
I wouldn't be surprised
if he killed his uncle.

249
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:28,943
What is wrong with you?

250
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,746
You're pathetic.

251
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:33,367
You two belong together.

252
00:16:38,043 --> 00:16:40,333
- You didn't have to do that.
- I did.

253
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,442
Jasper, all of this,
everything that's happened...

254
00:16:44,936 --> 00:16:47,025
It all started
with me and your uncle...

255
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:49,458
- It's not your fault.
- It is.

256
00:16:50,148 --> 00:16:51,885
If I hadn't...
It's okay.

257
00:16:52,273 --> 00:16:53,762
How can you say that?

258
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:56,640
You forgave me.
And I forgive you.

259
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,102
I forgive you.

260
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:14,116
Mr. Montgomery. Hi.

261
00:17:14,498 --> 00:17:15,868
Spence. Please.

262
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,176
Are you looking for Teddy?
Because he's not here right now.

263
00:17:21,343 --> 00:17:23,792
No, actually, I'm here
to talk to you.

264
00:17:26,452 --> 00:17:27,463
Come on in.

265
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:31,658
Would you like something
to drink or to eat?

266
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:34,840
- I don't think I have anything...
- I'm fine. Thanks.

267
00:17:35,485 --> 00:17:37,357
I'd like to ask you a question.

268
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:39,837
How long have you been
going out with my son?

269
00:17:40,004 --> 00:17:41,197
Officially?

270
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:43,395
A couple months, I guess.

271
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,731
Do you know how long
he's been playing tennis?

272
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:47,932
Since he was four.

273
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:51,795
- That's a long time.
- Long time.

274
00:17:52,131 --> 00:17:54,741
Now he's got this one chance

275
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,408
to go pro.
One chance.

276
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,788
Do you want to be the one
that ruins that for him?

277
00:18:02,283 --> 00:18:03,165
Me?

278
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,668
Your relationship is
starting to get in the way.

279
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,255
He's losing focus.

280
00:18:08,803 --> 00:18:11,697
So tell me something.
How much is it going to cost

281
00:18:11,864 --> 00:18:13,342
to get you to walk away?

282
00:18:14,717 --> 00:18:15,717
What?

283
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,596
$100,000.

284
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:22,601
$150?

285
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,451
No, I think...

286
00:18:25,144 --> 00:18:26,759
I think you should leave.

287
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,333
Please.

288
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,516
If you love my son,

289
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:34,655
don't get in the way of his dream.

290
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:56,125
Looks good.

291
00:18:56,607 --> 00:18:57,607
Thanks.

292
00:19:00,774 --> 00:19:01,975
You were right.

293
00:19:02,512 --> 00:19:05,324
I've been entirely too
wrapped up in my own life.

294
00:19:06,036 --> 00:19:07,938
But I want to be here for you. I do.

295
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,389
I screwed up.

296
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,652
But I'm here now.

297
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,449
And I promise it will
not happen again.

298
00:19:22,117 --> 00:19:23,117
Come on.

299
00:19:25,487 --> 00:19:26,874
Tell me what's going on.

300
00:19:28,997 --> 00:19:30,335
My dad came back.

301
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:33,026
- What? I thought he was in...
- He got out.

302
00:19:33,193 --> 00:19:34,340
Early parole.

303
00:19:34,648 --> 00:19:38,156
He just showed up here talking
about how he wanted a relationship.

304
00:19:38,323 --> 00:19:39,323
He did?

305
00:19:39,938 --> 00:19:41,112
What happened?

306
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:44,430
He took off.

307
00:19:46,094 --> 00:19:47,352
I'm sorry, Liam.

308
00:19:47,856 --> 00:19:49,313
Whatever. I'm fine.

309
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:51,513
I know you're fine.

310
00:19:52,089 --> 00:19:53,984
I can't believe I
wasn't there for you.

311
00:19:56,872 --> 00:19:57,821
It's okay.

312
00:19:58,248 --> 00:19:59,516
It's not okay.

313
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:02,738
But like I said,
it won't happen again.

314
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,369
You can trust me.

315
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:06,330
Poor people tend to be honorable.

316
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:16,840
Dude, you've got to
stop torturing yourself.

317
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,092
"Romantic night for

318
00:20:20,312 --> 00:20:21,524
Javianna."

319
00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:23,968
"Javianna?"

320
00:20:24,408 --> 00:20:25,224
Really?

321
00:20:30,353 --> 00:20:33,607
- What's up?
- Nothing. I was looking for Silver.

322
00:20:34,797 --> 00:20:35,994
She's not here.

323
00:20:37,689 --> 00:20:38,689
Thanks.

324
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,256
So I hear you and Lila broke up.

325
00:20:45,623 --> 00:20:46,723
That we did.

326
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,839
No, but it's cool.
You know, I'm glad to be free.

327
00:20:50,395 --> 00:20:52,709
You know me,
I'm not one to be tied down.

328
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,588
So, how about you?
Javianna?

329
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,674
My God, you saw that?

330
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,074
No, I didn't.

331
00:21:00,241 --> 00:21:02,719
No, I did.
Because Dixon showed it to me.

332
00:21:02,969 --> 00:21:04,471
So yeah, I did see it,

333
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,771
indirectly.

334
00:21:05,938 --> 00:21:09,594
Let me just say that I'm really
happy for you. I mean, Javier...

335
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:12,479
Javier... he seems like
such a terrific guy.

336
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,147
Talented, handsome.

337
00:21:14,891 --> 00:21:17,491
He seems like one of
those guys with the,

338
00:21:17,658 --> 00:21:19,695
washboard abs. Am I right?

339
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:22,364
Yeah, I guess so.

340
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,914
Dude, I knew it!

341
00:21:25,392 --> 00:21:26,542
You go, girl!

342
00:21:27,408 --> 00:21:29,410
Tomorrow is my first solo show,

343
00:21:29,577 --> 00:21:31,206
so in case you want to come.

344
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,456
Cool.

345
00:21:32,623 --> 00:21:34,486
I'll run it through the...

346
00:21:35,668 --> 00:21:37,004
old calendario.

347
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,820
What the hell is wrong with you?

348
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:46,933
Did I let on that I
had too many feelings?

349
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,889
Not at all. You let on that
you have feelings for Javier.

350
00:21:50,056 --> 00:21:51,961
- And his washboard abs.
- Dude, she...

351
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:54,178
She doesn't like me, all right?

352
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:56,315
See, how can I compete
with a guy like that?

353
00:21:57,023 --> 00:21:59,331
I can't serenade her
in some fancy theater.

354
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:02,279
My rabbi made me lip-synch the
Torah portion at my bar mitzvah.

355
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,281
Look. I'm sorry.

356
00:22:04,852 --> 00:22:07,743
But you have something that
Javier can't sing about, man.

357
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:10,353
You have a history with Adrianna.

358
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:13,106
Dude, you guys were in love, man.

359
00:22:13,682 --> 00:22:14,958
So tap into that.

360
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,835
And, make your play already.

361
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:16,353
175.

362
00:23:16,674 --> 00:23:18,974
Dude, I can't go any lower than 200.

363
00:23:19,622 --> 00:23:22,874
Look, man. This represents
two years of my life.

364
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:24,591
Carefully cultivated.

365
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,947
All right, I got a playlist
for every occasion.

366
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:30,325
And I'm throwing in my dock,
dude. Come on.

367
00:23:31,593 --> 00:23:33,453
Annie's Sweet 16 party mix.

368
00:23:34,178 --> 00:23:35,497
Yeah, that was me.

369
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,947
What the hell?

370
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,752
Thank you, man.

371
00:23:46,053 --> 00:23:47,592
What was that all about?

372
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:51,294
Making money, baby.
$600 in a day, to be exact.

373
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,476
- Why are you selling all your stuff?
- For our trip to Australia.

374
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:59,647
My parents said if I could come up with
the money for the ticket, I can go, so

375
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,733
- I'm coming up with the money.
- By selling all your stuff?

376
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:06,306
Look, honestly,
this trip to Australia

377
00:24:06,473 --> 00:24:08,447
is the only thing I'm
focusing on right now.

378
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:11,699
With everything
going on with my parents,

379
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:15,342
going on this trip and,
spending my summer with you...

380
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:17,164
It means everything to me.

381
00:24:36,477 --> 00:24:37,601
I'm so sorry.

382
00:24:38,327 --> 00:24:39,885
I just lost my #1 ranking,

383
00:24:40,052 --> 00:24:42,647
which means I just screwed
up my draw at nationals, which means

384
00:24:42,897 --> 00:24:46,401
I just threw away everything I've been
working for for the past three years.

385
00:24:49,185 --> 00:24:52,032
I shouldn't have lost.
I mean, I've beaten that kid twice.

386
00:24:52,527 --> 00:24:54,027
Maybe he got better.

387
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:01,041
I shouldn't have stayed up so late
last night. I should have gone to bed.

388
00:25:10,848 --> 00:25:12,094
This isn't working.

389
00:25:14,268 --> 00:25:16,018
Our relationship. It's...

390
00:25:16,576 --> 00:25:18,426
It's too much for me and...

391
00:25:19,288 --> 00:25:22,238
It's gotten too serious.
It's not what I wanted.

392
00:25:22,405 --> 00:25:24,321
I've been thinking
about this for a while,

393
00:25:24,488 --> 00:25:28,038
and I just wanted to wait
until after your match. I'm sorry.

394
00:25:28,205 --> 00:25:29,986
No. Silver, wait!

395
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,750
You're gonna knock 'em dead,
you know?

396
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,550
Thank you.

397
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:56,587
My God. Stop kissing or I might
take a picture and send it to Perez.

398
00:25:57,728 --> 00:25:59,420
On that note, I should probably go.

399
00:25:59,587 --> 00:26:01,810
Wait, what? You're not staying
for Ade's first gig?

400
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,953
Javier has to go to New York.
He has a gig tomorrow.

401
00:26:06,546 --> 00:26:08,346
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

402
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:14,771
It's a full house out there.

403
00:26:14,938 --> 00:26:16,038
Really? Yes!

404
00:26:16,205 --> 00:26:17,205
So...

405
00:26:17,853 --> 00:26:18,910
Did Navid come?

406
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,010
I didn't see him, actually.

407
00:26:22,058 --> 00:26:23,415
Navid again? Really?

408
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,500
No. There is no "Navid again."

409
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,067
I mean, he's moved on.
And so have I.

410
00:26:37,707 --> 00:26:40,015
- What took you so long?
- I had to pick this up.

411
00:26:42,014 --> 00:26:44,644
Listen. Navid, look.
I like you,

412
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,937
but me and Ivy,
we kind of got a good thing...

413
00:26:47,104 --> 00:26:49,149
Just shut up.
It's for Ade, okay?

414
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,882
**** Bro.
Like you said, we have history.

415
00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:54,914
I just need to remind her that
no one else knows her like I do.

416
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:57,616
So, here's the 11 and a six

417
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,101
because we first kissed
on the sixth of November.

418
00:27:00,268 --> 00:27:03,388
And here's her favorite flower.
A little tulip.

419
00:27:04,194 --> 00:27:07,309
And... her favorite food:
a little hamburger

420
00:27:07,476 --> 00:27:08,960
with tiny, tiny pickles on it.

421
00:27:11,522 --> 00:27:12,522
Cool.

422
00:27:13,121 --> 00:27:14,571
Just do me a favor.

423
00:27:14,738 --> 00:27:17,751
When you actually give it to her,
lose the baby voice.

424
00:27:17,918 --> 00:27:20,263
Gotcha. But I'm not
gonna give it to her.

425
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,354
I'm going to put it
in her dressing room

426
00:27:22,521 --> 00:27:25,060
while she's performing,
with a note on it that says,

427
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,603
"Meet me on the roof."

428
00:27:27,258 --> 00:27:29,269
- Why the roof?
- Ade's favorite movie is

429
00:27:29,436 --> 00:27:31,935
An Affair to Remember.
And there's this super-romantic scene

430
00:27:32,102 --> 00:27:34,695
where they're meeting on
the roof of the Empire State Building.

431
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:37,886
How cute is this? A little, mini Empire
State Building.

432
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:40,957
Dude. The voice.

433
00:27:42,003 --> 00:27:43,253
Yeah. Whatever.

434
00:27:44,237 --> 00:27:45,637
Wish me luck, bro.

435
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:46,955
Gotcha.

436
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,670
What's wrong?

437
00:28:51,225 --> 00:28:54,689
I've been thinking, and I really
don't think you should be selling

438
00:28:54,856 --> 00:28:58,095
all your stuff to come to Australia.
It's a little extreme, don't you think?

439
00:28:58,262 --> 00:29:01,323
How else am I going to get the money?
We're not all rich, you know?

440
00:29:02,631 --> 00:29:05,008
And what do you mean by that?

441
00:29:05,175 --> 00:29:07,454
Are you, like, implying that
I'm spoiled or something?

442
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,277
No. That's not what I meant.

443
00:29:09,444 --> 00:29:12,434
That's kind of exactly what
it sounded like.

444
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:14,627
I'm sorry that my mom has money.

445
00:29:14,877 --> 00:29:17,009
- And I'm sorry my parents don't.
- You see?

446
00:29:17,176 --> 00:29:19,799
This is kind of exactly why
you shouldn't be selling your stuff.

447
00:29:20,322 --> 00:29:22,477
- I'm sorry. What?
- What do you mean, "what"?

448
00:29:22,644 --> 00:29:25,638
- Look at us. We're fighting.
- Because you're being all judgmental.

449
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,016
So now, all the sudden
I'm judgmental?

450
00:29:28,455 --> 00:29:31,853
If that's what you think then you really
shouldn't be coming to Australia at all.

451
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,003
Fine. Then maybe we
shouldn't be dating at all.

452
00:29:43,641 --> 00:29:46,311
So, for the visual
part of the presentation,

453
00:29:46,478 --> 00:29:48,382
I thought we could
use some visual aids.

454
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:51,101
Obviously, we'll use a portrait,
but maybe we could actually

455
00:29:51,268 --> 00:29:54,667
take one of Vivaldi's scores
and blow it up really big.

456
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,608
What?

457
00:29:59,027 --> 00:30:01,527
I don't know
if this is my place or not,

458
00:30:01,694 --> 00:30:04,344
but I saw you with
Jasper the other day...

459
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:08,428
- The guy is a psycho.
- No, he's not. He just...

460
00:30:09,155 --> 00:30:10,205
He snapped.

461
00:30:10,372 --> 00:30:12,075
But everything's okay now.

462
00:30:12,242 --> 00:30:14,270
All right? He apologized to me.

463
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,734
- You can't really be serious.
- Look, please,

464
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:20,251
just let's not talk about Jasper.
I know what I'm doing.

465
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:24,441
So, will you, pull up
the written part on my laptop

466
00:30:24,608 --> 00:30:27,158
- while I look through our notes?
- Yeah, sure.

467
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:30,036
- What'd you call it?
- "Vivaldi," I think.

468
00:30:31,303 --> 00:30:33,665
Here's a untitled document.

469
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:40,663
What just happened?

470
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,830
Nothing.

471
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:45,260
Look, I don't feel like
doing work anymore, okay?

472
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,237
That's fine.

473
00:30:49,754 --> 00:30:51,266
I'll just get out of here.

474
00:31:02,963 --> 00:31:04,013
Having fun?

475
00:31:04,882 --> 00:31:07,010
Not really. No.

476
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,326
Me and Ivy just got into a fight.

477
00:31:10,576 --> 00:31:13,421
And I think we broke up.

478
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:16,458
Seems to be a lot
of that going around.

479
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:18,940
Me and Teddy...

480
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:21,254
We kind of broke up, too.

481
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:23,014
Really?

482
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,532
- I'm sorry.
- It sucks.

483
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,352
Yeah. It really sucks.

484
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,933
My man! Your music library?

485
00:31:34,942 --> 00:31:38,109
It's friggin' awesome, dude. And I'm not
just saying that cause I'm drunk.

486
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:40,190
Good to know, man.

487
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,440
But I am!

488
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:43,727
I'm seriously wasted!

489
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,527
You guys want some vodka?

490
00:31:47,898 --> 00:31:49,098
Sure. Why not?

491
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,103
Mademoiselle?

492
00:31:55,838 --> 00:31:56,838
Sure.

493
00:31:59,245 --> 00:32:00,745
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

494
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,411
What are you doing out here?

495
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:18,616
Okay. What's wrong, hon?

496
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:21,064
I broke up with Dixon.

497
00:32:21,478 --> 00:32:25,428
What? Why? Last I heard,
he was coming away with us.

498
00:32:25,595 --> 00:32:28,184
I know. But, you know,
then he starts selling all of his stuff

499
00:32:28,351 --> 00:32:30,301
to pay for his ticket, and...

500
00:32:32,188 --> 00:32:33,188
And?

501
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:37,372
And I don't know. It suddenly became,
like, the biggest thing in his life.

502
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,243
It was all he could talk about.
What if we get to Australia and,

503
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,003
We don't even get along?

504
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,712
Then, we'll have to drive him
to the Outback and ditch him.

505
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,297
It's not funny.

506
00:32:46,682 --> 00:32:49,443
Or we could take him to the airport.

507
00:32:51,492 --> 00:32:53,721
- You freaked out?
- I totally freaked out.

508
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,408
I get why you're freaked out,

509
00:32:57,575 --> 00:33:00,562
but, Ivy, sweetie,
instead of picking a fight,

510
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,233
you know, maybe you could
have talked to Dixon

511
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,350
about how you were feeling...

512
00:33:15,164 --> 00:33:18,209
Are you sure the
bathroom is this way?

513
00:33:20,156 --> 00:33:21,406
Yeah, for sure.

514
00:33:21,573 --> 00:33:22,573
No clue?

515
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,290
Not a one. Not a one.

516
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,290
Oh, wait.

517
00:33:28,084 --> 00:33:29,134
Here it is!

518
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:30,451
Ladies first.

519
00:33:30,618 --> 00:33:31,618
Thanks.

520
00:33:35,203 --> 00:33:39,080
One question, what's it about this place
that says "Ladies' Room" to you?

521
00:33:39,247 --> 00:33:40,247
What?

522
00:33:41,485 --> 00:33:43,028
It's a broom closet!

523
00:33:43,195 --> 00:33:46,345
You sent me to go to the bathroom
in a broom closet!

524
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:49,458
Okay, guilty as charged.
Let's go.

525
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:52,864
Can I say one thing before we leave
our broom closet forever?

526
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,114
Forever!

527
00:33:55,435 --> 00:33:57,935
Ivy's an idiot for
breaking up with you

528
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:02,068
because you, Dixon Wilson,
you are a great...

529
00:34:02,764 --> 00:34:05,043
- guy.
- Oh, stop.

530
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,293
Thank you.

531
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:09,422
And, I mean,
I have to say, too, Teddy

532
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:11,417
is a complete idiot

533
00:34:12,466 --> 00:34:15,055
because you, Miss Erin Silver...

534
00:34:16,766 --> 00:34:18,139
you are a great girl.

535
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,349
Thank you!

536
00:34:21,035 --> 00:34:22,685
No problem, no problem.

537
00:34:36,093 --> 00:34:38,493
- Listen...
- This is a total... it was a mistake.

538
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,787
Total mistake cause...

539
00:34:41,766 --> 00:34:42,872
We're both drunk.

540
00:34:43,236 --> 00:34:45,781
Exact. Totally drunk, and,

541
00:34:45,948 --> 00:34:47,210
totally idiotic.

542
00:34:48,326 --> 00:34:51,425
- So it never...
- Yeah nothing. Never happened.

543
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:52,842
Never happened.

544
00:34:55,013 --> 00:34:56,163
Ladies first.

545
00:35:03,886 --> 00:35:05,436
Hey, Dixon, can I...?

546
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,300
can I talk to you for a second?

547
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:10,608
- I'll see you later.
- Sure.

548
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:14,862
Okay, look, I messed up, okay?
I know. I just...

549
00:35:16,027 --> 00:35:17,427
I don't even know.

550
00:35:18,266 --> 00:35:20,547
I guess I'm kind of this...

551
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:23,121
you know, no-strings-attached
kind of girl,

552
00:35:24,691 --> 00:35:27,141
and somehow in my mind,
Australia just

553
00:35:27,455 --> 00:35:29,377
kinda became like this marriage.

554
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,505
No offense or anything,
but to me, it was just a trip.

555
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:35,105
- Right.
- A chance to get away for a summer

556
00:35:35,272 --> 00:35:37,969
with a cool girl and maybe
see a kangaroo or something.

557
00:35:39,082 --> 00:35:40,555
I know. I just freaked out.

558
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,696
But...

559
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:47,228
I do really want you to come
if you still want to.

560
00:35:47,744 --> 00:35:48,744
Come here.

561
00:36:12,413 --> 00:36:13,413
Good job.

562
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:17,466
- You were great out there.
- Thank you.

563
00:36:20,609 --> 00:36:21,609
Amazing!

564
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:24,140
What are you still doing here?!

565
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,809
I thought you had to catch
a plane to New York.

566
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,035
One of the perks of private planes.

567
00:36:29,202 --> 00:36:31,581
I stayed for the first song,
and I just couldn't leave.

568
00:36:31,748 --> 00:36:33,605
- Stop it.
- No, really.

569
00:36:34,245 --> 00:36:35,845
Which got me thinking.

570
00:36:36,012 --> 00:36:39,322
How do you like to come to New York
and perform our duet onstage?

571
00:36:40,508 --> 00:36:41,866
You're kidding, right?

572
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:44,243
There's a car outside,
but we have to leave now.

573
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:48,080
- Now? As in now now?
- As in five minutes ago now.

574
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:49,791
What about my stuff?

575
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,211
My assistant will pack the dressing room
make sure everything is in the hotel,

576
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,440
and anything else you need
we'll just buy in New York.

577
00:36:57,344 --> 00:36:59,634
- You in?
- Yeah, I'm in.

578
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,512
- I am totally in!
- Let's go.

579
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,584
We're off to New York!
Come out and see us there!

580
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,265
What's up, Dad?

581
00:37:56,432 --> 00:37:58,725
How could you even ask if
you could go to Australia?

582
00:37:58,892 --> 00:38:00,575
What were you thinking?

583
00:38:02,412 --> 00:38:05,362
Look, I thought it would be
a great opportunity,

584
00:38:05,958 --> 00:38:08,223
and Mom told me that you
and her talked about it...

585
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:11,321
We did, and, she said you could go
cause she doesn't know what happened.

586
00:38:11,488 --> 00:38:14,307
She doesn't know about the gambling,
the breaking into school.

587
00:38:14,474 --> 00:38:16,924
Then maybe
you should tell me about it.

588
00:38:22,285 --> 00:38:25,084
- How's the surfing going?
- How's it going?

589
00:38:25,251 --> 00:38:28,551
Yeah, I mean, have you learned
any new tricks recently?

590
00:38:28,718 --> 00:38:30,468
I don't really do tricks.

591
00:38:30,796 --> 00:38:32,534
What's all this interest in surfing?

592
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:35,166
Potential housekeeper.
I'll call her back after lunch.

593
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:38,983
What do you mean? We have Rosa.
Why would we need another housekeeper?

594
00:38:39,363 --> 00:38:41,110
We had to let Rosa go.

595
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,320
What? Why?

596
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,822
She stole some coins from
Jeffrey's collection.

597
00:38:50,626 --> 00:38:52,776
I don't think that could be true.

598
00:38:53,393 --> 00:38:54,893
I mean, it can't be.

599
00:39:00,205 --> 00:39:02,924
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

600
00:39:03,321 --> 00:39:04,467
Look, can I see you?

601
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,218
I really need to talk.

602
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:18,381
Yeah, listen, can we talk later?

603
00:39:18,548 --> 00:39:20,524
I'm actually in bed.
I think I have the flu.

604
00:39:20,774 --> 00:39:23,074
Are you okay?
Do you need anything?

605
00:39:23,241 --> 00:39:25,575
Just rest.
I'll call you back, okay?

606
00:39:25,742 --> 00:39:26,742
All right.

607
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,544
Up yours, loser!

608
00:39:47,643 --> 00:39:51,097
Listen, I'm really sorry that I butted
into your business last night.

609
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:54,693
No I'm sorry I overreacted.

610
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,894
I was just in a bad mood.

611
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,994
No, it's fine.
It happens.

612
00:39:59,729 --> 00:40:02,566
Listen, I could really
use your advice.

613
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:05,528
- Can we meet in the park?
- Of course.

614
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,614
Bye.

615
00:40:20,448 --> 00:40:22,628
What are you doing here?

616
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,397
More to the point,
what are you doing here?

617
00:40:26,482 --> 00:40:28,759
Oh, so you must be Jay Boyd?

618
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,970
Are you having an
affair with my sister?

619
00:40:31,641 --> 00:40:32,641
God, no.

620
00:40:33,448 --> 00:40:35,450
No offense, sweetie.

621
00:40:36,132 --> 00:40:38,482
Naomi, this is my new assistant Leo.

622
00:40:41,531 --> 00:40:44,271
Who's Jay Boyd then? Why'd you act
like you were hiding something

623
00:40:44,438 --> 00:40:46,538
when he called you on the phone?

624
00:40:47,205 --> 00:40:48,612
Dr. Boyd will see you now.

625
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:50,841
Okay, thank you.

626
00:40:52,973 --> 00:40:55,417
Because, Naomi,
I was hiding something.

627
00:40:55,584 --> 00:40:59,165
You got me.
Jay Boyd is my OB.

628
00:41:01,828 --> 00:41:02,828
Surprise!

629
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,660
You're gonna be an auntie.
