00:00:00,629 --> 00:00:02,515
<i>Previously on 90210:</i>

2
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:05,687
We have been dispatched to spread
winter cheer. And to tell you all...

3
00:00:05,854 --> 00:00:07,826
The Winter Wonderland Dance is near.

4
00:00:07,996 --> 00:00:11,051
- You don't want to go to the dance?
- Whatever. Sure, I'll go.

5
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:15,473
So what if I felt something when we
kissed? That doesn't change the fact...

6
00:00:16,087 --> 00:00:18,221
You just said you felt
something when you kissed.

7
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:22,307
This is my sister back
from boarding school.

8
00:00:22,474 --> 00:00:25,186
For the life of me,
I can't remember why I ever let you go.

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,525
Do you still have
feelings for Naomi?

10
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:33,522
- I do.
- I got a text from Ivy

11
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:36,629
saying I had to come here,
that you had something to tell me.

12
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:39,998
- I know this guy's a drug dealer.
- What proof do you have?

13
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,417
I've been buying from
Jasper for the last month.

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,218
Don't. Stay away from me.

15
00:00:44,385 --> 00:00:46,504
Why? You've made mistakes,
but I don't judge you.

16
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:50,003
- What are you talking about?
- You accidentally ran over my uncle.

17
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,577
I'm gonna read War and Peace.

18
00:01:05,372 --> 00:01:06,974
One of my New Year's resolutions.

19
00:01:07,144 --> 00:01:09,265
Why not?
It's really long,

20
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,488
but it's not in Morse code.

21
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:13,693
- I can read it.
- Send.

22
00:01:14,153 --> 00:01:15,992
You're so not listening to me.

23
00:01:16,162 --> 00:01:18,156
Sure I am.
I'm just texting Liam.

24
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:22,009
For my New Year's resolution...

25
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,561
He's surfing.

26
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,543
And he misses me.

27
00:01:26,126 --> 00:01:27,540
I have so much to tell him.

28
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:39,135
She just turned down La Cienega.

29
00:01:39,616 --> 00:01:41,057
Somebody's text-whipped.

30
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:42,263
She's cute.

31
00:01:42,523 --> 00:01:43,738
He is cute.

32
00:01:43,908 --> 00:01:46,017
We're cute.
This is so exciting!

33
00:01:46,465 --> 00:01:47,477
So nauseating.

34
00:01:47,737 --> 00:01:49,702
"Irritating" is the
word that came to mind.

35
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:51,891
- Don't be a hater.
- I'm not being a hater.

36
00:01:52,061 --> 00:01:53,846
I'm happy for you, actually.

37
00:01:54,183 --> 00:01:56,378
I'm happy if you're happy,
all right?

38
00:01:57,197 --> 00:01:59,614
Did Naomi say anything
about Silver in those texts?

39
00:02:00,546 --> 00:02:02,122
What's up with you two, anyway?

40
00:02:02,482 --> 00:02:04,119
I can't believe you guys kissed.

41
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:06,496
I know. It was out of the blue.

42
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:08,314
It was amazing, man.

43
00:02:08,914 --> 00:02:10,959
Can't wait to talk to
her tomorrow at school.

44
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:13,878
I just really hope Dixon
feels the same way.

45
00:02:14,806 --> 00:02:17,298
- See you later, boy.
- All right, brother.

46
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:24,963
Look at all this.

47
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:26,989
I figured we had cause to celebrate.

48
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,095
It's a new year.
Annie comes home tonight.

49
00:02:29,265 --> 00:02:31,604
And did I tell you
that she called to say she missed us?

50
00:02:32,056 --> 00:02:33,653
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

51
00:02:33,908 --> 00:02:36,450
And last night on the phone,
she was even laughing.

52
00:02:36,617 --> 00:02:39,063
And it wasn't that snarky,
derisive laugh.

53
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:40,556
It was the good kind.

54
00:02:40,726 --> 00:02:44,124
- It's a miracle I still recognize it.
- Who knew Vegas was the answer?

55
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:46,416
Two weeks on the Strip
would've driven me crazy,

56
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:48,705
and that's even if my
mother wasn't living there.

57
00:02:49,778 --> 00:02:53,048
Is this that same boosters
reception we went to last year?

58
00:02:55,015 --> 00:02:56,051
I think it is.

59
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,467
Did you not tell me about this earlier
because you knew Kelly would be there?

60
00:03:03,771 --> 00:03:05,930
I didn't want you
to be uncomfortable.

61
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,006
- Should I be uncomfortable?
- Sweetheart, of course not.

62
00:03:09,176 --> 00:03:12,604
I've barely exchanged ten words with her
since we realized she had a crush on me.

63
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:15,023
Since you realized that.

64
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:18,651
But trust me,
I've done everything I can to avoid her.

65
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:20,862
I am not interested
in avoiding anybody.

66
00:03:21,122 --> 00:03:24,482
And I won't let Kelly determine
what school functions I attend.

67
00:03:24,652 --> 00:03:27,335
I'm going to this.
Just like I did last year.

68
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:29,628
Great.

69
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:42,422
And if I think about it, I can't even
remember why me and Silver broke up.

70
00:03:43,102 --> 00:03:46,856
Wasn't it because she liked horror
movies and you're afraid of the dark?

71
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:49,984
Very funny.

72
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:54,145
Me and her, we both did our thing.

73
00:03:54,405 --> 00:03:56,584
She's changed. I've changed.

74
00:03:56,878 --> 00:03:58,733
Now maybe we can get back together.

75
00:03:59,584 --> 00:04:01,989
I'm gonna talk to her
tomorrow at school.

76
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:04,697
Definitely before U.S.
History though.

77
00:04:04,957 --> 00:04:07,431
Cause then she gets
hopped up on conspiracy theories

78
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:09,843
and then there's no talking to her.

79
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:15,839
You okay?

80
00:04:18,673 --> 00:04:22,549
I'm really not looking forward to going
back to school tomorrow, that's all.

81
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,002
It's not going to
be as bad as you think.

82
00:04:25,172 --> 00:04:27,720
You already did the hard
part and broke up with Jasper...

83
00:04:28,387 --> 00:04:30,395
It's already better than it was.

84
00:04:42,662 --> 00:04:44,121
I'll be right down.

85
00:04:51,963 --> 00:04:55,164
<i>Welcome Home I missed you so much
Love, Jasper</i>

86
00:05:05,903 --> 00:05:09,275
Are you sure I look tan enough in this
shirt? I swore this was a blue-white,

87
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:11,306
but now it's looking
like a yellow-white.

88
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:14,326
Yes, Naomi, you look incredibly tan.

89
00:05:14,496 --> 00:05:17,270
In fact, you look tanner
than you did yesterday.

90
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,197
How is that even possible?

91
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:21,804
I may have gone to the
tanning salon last night.

92
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:25,945
I really want a "wow" effect when I walk
into Allison's sister's birthday party.

93
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:30,179
I wouldn't worry. Everybody's going to
be like, "Wow, you've got leather skin."

94
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:32,900
That's like 20 years away.
The party is tomorrow night.

95
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,425
It's going to be a total blowout.
She rented out the beach club.

96
00:05:36,595 --> 00:05:38,312
- I cannot...
- Hey guys...

97
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:42,045
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to interrupt.

98
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,797
- You didn't.
- How was your break?

99
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:47,688
It was good.
Just laid low.

100
00:05:47,954 --> 00:05:49,594
How about yours? How was St. Barts?

101
00:05:50,794 --> 00:05:52,263
You look really tan.

102
00:05:54,295 --> 00:05:56,314
- It was great.
- Tan-tastic.

103
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,180
That's great.

104
00:05:58,518 --> 00:06:01,189
I should probably get going.
I'll see you guys later?

105
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:05,048
What did I tell you?

106
00:06:06,037 --> 00:06:08,494
I didn't know if it was going to cold,
but it wasn't bad.

107
00:06:08,664 --> 00:06:11,144
And I got the 3.
2, so it was all right.

108
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:14,147
- What's up, dudes?
- What's up, kid?

109
00:06:14,317 --> 00:06:16,695
- So Northern California was cool?
- It was awesome.

110
00:06:16,865 --> 00:06:18,911
I really like Berkeley.
Cool place, man.

111
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:20,680
I even brought this,

112
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,409
this really cool souvenir.

113
00:06:26,457 --> 00:06:27,851
Navid, is that...?

114
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,348
What the hell are
you doing with cocaine?

115
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:36,062

<i>Rats and heroes</i>

118
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,202
I think you need to put that away.

119
00:06:56,462 --> 00:06:58,541
- What's wrong with you?
- Will you just relax?

120
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,226
We will not relax.
What are you doing with...

121
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:05,545
cocaine?
You don't do drugs. At least I hope.

122
00:07:06,013 --> 00:07:07,714
Of course I don't.

123
00:07:07,974 --> 00:07:10,508
I was going to plant this in
Jasper's locker.

124
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,225
I was gonna call that number.
They'll find the stuff.

125
00:07:13,395 --> 00:07:15,221
It'll be all buh-bye.

126
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:17,926
Just like the poster says.
I'm not a rat.

127
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,852
- I'm a hero.
- You're not a hero.

128
00:07:21,112 --> 00:07:22,186
You're an idiot.

129
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,340
Seriously,
this is a really bad idea.

130
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:26,904
Worse than your Boys of
the Blaze fund-raising calendar.

131
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,698
Jasper is already a drug dealer.

132
00:07:29,868 --> 00:07:32,798
I'm bringing that to the attention
of the powers-that-be. It's simple.

133
00:07:33,374 --> 00:07:36,542
All right, fine. How do
you plan on getting in his locker?

134
00:07:39,327 --> 00:07:41,882
There's this master list of

135
00:07:42,052 --> 00:07:44,565
all the student locker combinations

136
00:07:45,344 --> 00:07:48,046
on file in the principal's office.

137
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:51,245
Me?

138
00:07:53,008 --> 00:07:54,008
Sorry.

139
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,021
I understand.
You wanna think about it.

140
00:07:57,188 --> 00:07:59,717
No way. I'm not helping you with this.
It's stupid.

141
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,225
You're on your own.

142
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,480
- It's your funeral.
- It's not that big of a deal.

143
00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:14,655
Did you get my flowers?

144
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:18,728
I really missed you.

145
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,828
Jasper, stop. We're not dating.

146
00:08:21,357 --> 00:08:23,790
- What are you talking about?
- I'm breaking up with you.

147
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,925
- You don't mean that.
- Yeah, I do.

148
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:27,628
It's over.

149
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,037
Then I'll tell.

150
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:32,379
What?

151
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:36,302
I'll go to the police and
I'll tell them what you did.

152
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:39,472
All they need is a lead in the case.

153
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:42,975
They'll probably start combing
through your Internet history.

154
00:08:43,235 --> 00:08:47,230
See if you have any...
special interest in the case.

155
00:08:49,954 --> 00:08:52,735
I'm guessing that it's not
going to be that hard to find evidence.

156
00:08:54,272 --> 00:08:57,833
You probably took the car to
a local body shop that night, right?

157
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:00,076
After you ran over my uncle.

158
00:09:02,618 --> 00:09:04,163
Why are you doing this?

159
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:06,297
I love you.

160
00:09:07,896 --> 00:09:09,502
You love me. I know you do.

161
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,425
We've both made mistakes,
but I want to put them behind us.

162
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,796
Just say you can do that,

163
00:09:19,223 --> 00:09:20,715
and I'll keep your secret.

164
00:09:29,562 --> 00:09:30,576
Come here.

165
00:09:48,164 --> 00:09:51,145
If it isn't the
fancy Caribbean jet-setter.

166
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,045
That is me.

167
00:09:54,617 --> 00:09:56,883
I want to talk about
what happened at the dance.

168
00:09:58,523 --> 00:09:59,594
Me, too.

169
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,783
It was obviously a mistake.

170
00:10:04,447 --> 00:10:06,647
Exactly. That's exactly
what I was going to say.

171
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:08,561
We broke up for a reason.

172
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:11,397
Like you said,
you could never be yourself around me.

173
00:10:12,516 --> 00:10:14,132
That's what I said.

174
00:10:14,493 --> 00:10:16,736
I think I was just
feeling vulnerable.

175
00:10:18,414 --> 00:10:21,982
I was feeling rejected by Teddy,
and when I saw him with that girl, but,

176
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,755
the truth is...

177
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:27,914
Maybe I just jump to conclusions.
Maybe that girl was just his friend.

178
00:10:29,022 --> 00:10:31,959
Anyway, I'm going to talk to him
and see if we ca figure things out.

179
00:10:33,494 --> 00:10:35,517
That sounds like a good idea.

180
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:38,883
I'm going to let you get back to work.
And I'll talk to you later?

181
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,624
Hey, Ives.
What you reading?

182
00:10:54,142 --> 00:10:55,441
The Violent Messiahs.

183
00:10:57,903 --> 00:11:00,295
It's actually really rad.
It's Lieutenant Major Cheri,

184
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:02,263
who's apparently
a schizophrenic now,

185
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:04,867
and she's chasing down this
gnarly masked villain...

186
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:06,958
Spoiler alert.

187
00:11:09,595 --> 00:11:12,951
I wanted to thank you for
sending me that text after the dance.

188
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:14,377
That was nothing.

189
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:18,260
- It wasn't nothing. You were together.
- Me and Liam? No. Please.

190
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,093
That was nothing serious.
And I knew he liked you, so...

191
00:11:22,992 --> 00:11:24,554
It meant something to me.

192
00:11:24,987 --> 00:11:26,347
And in appreciation,

193
00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:30,445
a little thank you
gift from St. Bart's.

194
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,780
You really didn't have to do that.

195
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,313
Go ahead. Open it.

196
00:11:36,438 --> 00:11:38,649
It was not easy shopping there,
by the way.

197
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:40,625
Everyone kept yammering
away in French,

198
00:11:40,795 --> 00:11:43,114
but I found that if you spoke
loudly and slowly enough,

199
00:11:43,281 --> 00:11:46,289
you could eventually get through to them
that you did not want their junk.

200
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:48,713
I hit the jackpot at Duty Free.

201
00:11:57,221 --> 00:11:59,797
- Isn't this something?
- I hope you don't have one already.

202
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:02,254
Definitely not.

203
00:12:03,386 --> 00:12:06,220
But I've always wanted a pocketbook.

204
00:12:06,849 --> 00:12:09,231
It's a Fendi baguette.
But no worries.

205
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:11,976
But it's the least I could do.
Anyway. Thanks again, Ives.

206
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:26,308
I'm not saying, "kick him
in the groin," but near the groin...

207
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:28,171
would be great.

208
00:12:34,008 --> 00:12:35,583
So, how was vacation?

209
00:12:41,015 --> 00:12:43,054
- A blast.
- Time of my life.

210
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,542
Aspen, right?

211
00:12:48,188 --> 00:12:51,140
We're really gonna pretend everything's
fine? I saw you kiss Silver.

212
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,530
At least man up.
That was a lame-ass move.

213
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,144
You know I liked her.

214
00:12:55,404 --> 00:12:57,634
Come on.
It can't be that big of a deal.

215
00:12:57,804 --> 00:13:00,232
I bet you got over it pretty
quickly in Aspen.

216
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:05,613
I didn't just get over
it 'cause I like Silver.

217
00:13:05,873 --> 00:13:08,574
I thought I'd made that
fairly clear by the night of the dance.

218
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,376
If there's something going on between
you two, I think I deserve to know.

219
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,714
I'll be straight with you.

220
00:13:26,031 --> 00:13:28,052
I don't think me and
Silver are over yet.

221
00:13:28,312 --> 00:13:30,554
What happened the night of the dance?
It happened.

222
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:32,486
Will it happen again?

223
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:33,825
Probably.

224
00:13:34,655 --> 00:13:37,280
We're trying to keep it on the DL,
but between me and you,

225
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,563
we're talking about getting
back together again.

226
00:13:39,823 --> 00:13:41,065
Come on, man.

227
00:14:06,643 --> 00:14:09,343
- How was your break?
- It was good. How was yours?

228
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,641
Too short.

229
00:14:11,712 --> 00:14:12,905
I hear you.

230
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,185
We haven't really
talked since the dance.

231
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,397
Wondering what's going
on with you and Jasper.

232
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:25,281
Tell us you broke up with him.

233
00:14:27,656 --> 00:14:29,869
- It's complicated.
- What's complicated about it?

234
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,350
- He's a drug dealer.
- He lied to you.

235
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:34,201
He's a really bad guy.

236
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,996
- And he's pretty greasy-looking.
- Stop.

237
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,252
Please just stop.

238
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:41,000
You don't get to do this.

239
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,464
Leave me alone.

240
00:14:43,662 --> 00:14:44,879
It shouldn't be hard.

241
00:14:45,238 --> 00:14:46,714
You've done it before.

242
00:14:58,852 --> 00:14:59,852
Hey, you.

243
00:15:00,502 --> 00:15:02,558
- Silver. What's up?
- Not much.

244
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:05,703
I want to talk to you
about what happened at the dance.

245
00:15:05,873 --> 00:15:08,498
Because,
I thought about it a lot and I...

246
00:15:09,203 --> 00:15:11,849
About that.
You were right about me all along.

247
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:15,367
"Once a player, always a player."
Your words, right?

248
00:15:15,627 --> 00:15:17,549
I can't be tied down to one person.

249
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:20,581
- It's not in my DNA.
- Why are you telling me this?

250
00:15:21,124 --> 00:15:23,103
Because you saw it before I did.

251
00:15:23,273 --> 00:15:26,593
I can't even decide who to take
to this Beach Club party on Saturday.

252
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,048
Emiko's hot, but, Alisa's...

253
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,145
She's easy.

254
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:32,926
Dilemma, right?

255
00:15:34,444 --> 00:15:37,056
I'm sure you're going
to figure it out, though.

256
00:15:51,512 --> 00:15:52,995
How's it going, man?

257
00:15:59,945 --> 00:16:01,710
Dixon! Wait! I need to talk to you.

258
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:04,351
- What's up?
- It's about Annie.

259
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:05,918
She's still dating Jasper.

260
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:07,949
What?!

261
00:16:08,555 --> 00:16:10,994
I saw them holding hands.
I went to talk to her about it,

262
00:16:11,164 --> 00:16:14,868
but she said it's not my right
to interfere. And she's right. It isn't.

263
00:16:15,948 --> 00:16:19,139
But maybe you can do something about it.
You're her brother.

264
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,475
Maybe she'll listen to you.

265
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:41,169
Hey, you.

266
00:16:43,423 --> 00:16:44,733
Hi, Gia.

267
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,298
I didn't know you were in AA.

268
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,348
That's sort of what
the "Anonymous" is about.

269
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:54,466
It was a joke.
I was kidding.

270
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:59,179
A couple of us always go bowling
after the meetings. You want to come?

271
00:16:59,966 --> 00:17:01,228
I don't think so.

272
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,364
You sure? Last week we had

273
00:17:03,531 --> 00:17:06,254
a down-to-the-last-frame match
with some dentists from Culver City.

274
00:17:06,421 --> 00:17:08,272
- Very exciting.
- That sounds tempting.

275
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:10,444
But the thing is,

276
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:13,652
AA is a part of me,
but I don't want it to be my whole life.

277
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:19,704
I just like having friends around
who understand what I'm going through.

278
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:21,838
- I figured...
- My friends do.

279
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,815
Or... they did.

280
00:17:24,264 --> 00:17:27,750
Things are kind of weird with
us right now, but I'm working on it.

281
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:29,877
Thanks anyway.

282
00:17:30,137 --> 00:17:33,631
If you change your mind or if
you ever want to talk, give me a call.

283
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:38,302
I'll see you around.

284
00:17:56,866 --> 00:17:57,983
Thank you.

285
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:04,775
Thanks.

286
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:08,121
This is great.

287
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:11,635
I've been planning
this night for a long time.

288
00:18:11,805 --> 00:18:13,611
I wanted it to be perfect.

289
00:18:14,502 --> 00:18:16,358
- Good job.
- Thanks.

290
00:18:17,252 --> 00:18:18,479
You're welcome.

291
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,317
Thanks.

292
00:18:24,757 --> 00:18:26,350
- What was that?
- Sorry.

293
00:18:26,714 --> 00:18:27,860
Nothing...

294
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:33,064
Here we are.
At last.

295
00:18:33,234 --> 00:18:35,150
I know, right? Finally.

296
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,593
- How was vacation?
- How was St. Bart's?

297
00:18:39,763 --> 00:18:41,407
- Sorry.
- No go ahead.

298
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:43,866
I was asking you about St. Bart's.

299
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,246
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah, it was gorgeous.

300
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,439
Did you go snorkeling?

301
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:53,168
How about parasailing? I hear
they have amazing parasailing there.

302
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:57,006
No, I really just kind of
laid by the pool the whole time.

303
00:18:59,052 --> 00:19:00,991
- Sounds fun.
- Yeah. It was great.

304
00:19:01,161 --> 00:19:03,936
- What about you? What did you do?
- I worked on the boat.

305
00:19:04,507 --> 00:19:07,689
The hull's been planked and ribbed,
so I've just got to finish the framing,

306
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:09,226
sheathe the deck panels...

307
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,603
And this is boring.

308
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,899
It's not boring.
Deck panels are rad.

309
00:19:22,477 --> 00:19:23,907
What's new with you?

310
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:26,118
I'm redecorating the house.

311
00:19:27,162 --> 00:19:30,403
I'm working with this Feng Shui expert.
At first I thought it was

312
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,296
another Chinese scam like
Tai Chi or acupuncture.

313
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:38,196
But she's on to something. She's helping
me remove all signs of Jen, so...

314
00:19:38,363 --> 00:19:39,386
That's good.

315
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:41,996
That makes sense.

316
00:19:43,374 --> 00:19:45,804
- Sorry. I shouldn't have mentioned Jen.
- No, it's okay.

317
00:19:46,064 --> 00:19:47,269
No, it's not.

318
00:19:48,942 --> 00:19:52,186
I just want to really forget
about her and everything she did.

319
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:57,316
- I'm really sorry again.
- Can we not talk about it? Please.

320
00:19:59,355 --> 00:20:00,611
Of course. Sorry.

321
00:20:04,006 --> 00:20:05,752
Have you seen the waiter?

322
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:13,504
You will love this.

323
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:16,188
So, see? Now you shake,

324
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:17,982
and it's gone.

325
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,566
So dad can't bust me for reading about
Jude Law's latest love child

326
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:23,514
instead of writing my Hamlet Paper.

327
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:29,012
Though, technically, because Jude Law
is playing hamlet on Broadway,

328
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:31,731
can't you just argue
that it's research?

329
00:20:32,436 --> 00:20:33,440
Not bad.

330
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,725
So, I heard through the grapevine
that you're

331
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,411
back with Jasper.

332
00:20:47,238 --> 00:20:50,082
- Stay out of it.
- I just don't get it.

333
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,750
You don't have to.

334
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,037
That guy is bad news
you gotta see that.

335
00:20:54,349 --> 00:20:56,255
Stop. Okay, seriously,

336
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,909
I don't want to talk
to you about Jasper.

337
00:20:59,878 --> 00:21:02,719
And we've been getting along lately.
Let's not mess it up.

338
00:21:03,134 --> 00:21:04,138
Okay?

339
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:05,948
Okay.

340
00:21:07,002 --> 00:21:08,002
I'm sorry.

341
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:10,978
I actually kind of like that
we've been getting along.

342
00:21:13,802 --> 00:21:16,302
- I'll talk to you later.
- Good night.

343
00:21:27,337 --> 00:21:29,273
- Hey, Navid.
- Dixon?

344
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:31,248
Yeah. It's Dixon.

345
00:21:32,342 --> 00:21:33,942
About the Jasper plan?

346
00:21:34,532 --> 00:21:35,532
I'm in.

347
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:40,907
What's up?

348
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,105
- So, how are things?
- Good, good.

349
00:21:45,282 --> 00:21:48,082
Go on. How was the big
date with the big "N"?

350
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,070
- What?
- Nothing, just...

351
00:21:53,449 --> 00:21:55,099
Isn't it kind of weird?

352
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,000
Can we talk about that?

353
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,590
Not for me.

354
00:22:01,474 --> 00:22:04,374
Liam, get over yourself cause I did.

355
00:22:05,516 --> 00:22:09,520
Seriously, what, you think I'm in love
with you or something? Get real!

356
00:22:10,036 --> 00:22:12,436
Whatever. I'll just
ask Naomi myself.

357
00:22:13,015 --> 00:22:15,334
You know she gave me a pocketbook?

358
00:22:15,591 --> 00:22:16,591
Seriously?

359
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,527
We're, like, buds.

360
00:22:20,868 --> 00:22:22,318
Between you and me,

361
00:22:22,892 --> 00:22:24,742
the date didn't go so well.

362
00:22:25,524 --> 00:22:26,624
You serious?

363
00:22:27,377 --> 00:22:30,262
Yeah, it was awkward
and just... weird.

364
00:22:30,692 --> 00:22:33,043
- I'm sorry, man.
- Yeah, it sucked.

365
00:22:34,696 --> 00:22:36,096
Okay, but you know

366
00:22:36,263 --> 00:22:38,163
you win some, you lose some.

367
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,249
It was worth a shot, I guess.

368
00:22:40,932 --> 00:22:43,032
- Right?
- It was worth a shot.

369
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,820
I got it.

370
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,916
Mrs. List, do you mind if I go leave
a note on my dad's desk?

371
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,690
Go right ahead.

372
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,120
I'll wait right here for you, bro.

373
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,590
Nice blouse, mrs. L.

374
00:23:04,332 --> 00:23:05,332
Files...

375
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,720
The paisley's really
working for you.

376
00:23:13,514 --> 00:23:15,060
Have you seen Silver?

377
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,561
No.

378
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:19,161
Shoot. I really need to talk to her.

379
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,733
- Is everything okay?
- No, it's not.

380
00:23:22,597 --> 00:23:23,897
What's going on?

381
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,028
Come on. You can tell me.

382
00:23:32,483 --> 00:23:35,289
I had my first date with Liam last night
and it was terrible.

383
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:40,585
We had absolutely nothing to say
to each other. I don't get it.

384
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:43,964
How could things between such
good-looking people be so boring?!

385
00:23:44,737 --> 00:23:47,594
You're probably nervous and he was
probably nervous. You both

386
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:50,644
- just wanted it to be perfect.
- It wasn't perfect.

387
00:23:50,926 --> 00:23:52,626
It wasn't even passable.

388
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:56,268
I think we lost our spark.
Maybe we have no chemistry anymore.

389
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,197
Don't give up.
This is Liam we're talking about.

390
00:23:59,364 --> 00:24:02,459
- You've waited so long.
- Maybe we waited too long.

391
00:24:02,626 --> 00:24:05,277
- Maybe we missed our moment.
- I don't believe that.

392
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,904
I think there was just
a lot of build-up. That's all.

393
00:24:08,578 --> 00:24:10,821
And if chemistry is what
you're worried about,

394
00:24:10,988 --> 00:24:13,243
I think there's a pretty clear way
to test that out.

395
00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:18,874
You could be right.

396
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:21,209
Thanks.

397
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:22,961
Of course. Anytime.

398
00:24:24,787 --> 00:24:27,814
Silver and I are going to
Allison's sister's 21st birthday party.

399
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:30,260
I think you should come with us.

400
00:24:32,094 --> 00:24:33,305
I'd love to.

401
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,264
Good.

402
00:24:53,222 --> 00:24:54,372
Come to papa.

403
00:24:57,314 --> 00:24:58,614
Look who's here.

404
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,166
Principal Wilson in the house.

405
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,295
Looks like you lost
some weight. Am I right?

406
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,422
Could bed a couple of pounds.

407
00:25:09,197 --> 00:25:11,510
You look fantastic,
just... fantastic.

408
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,428
Well, yeah, thank you.

409
00:25:15,684 --> 00:25:16,684
Thank you.

410
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:19,767
Hey, dad!

411
00:25:21,036 --> 00:25:23,117
I was just about to leave you a note

412
00:25:23,284 --> 00:25:26,233
tell you I was going to Navid's
house, but you know, you're here.

413
00:25:26,915 --> 00:25:28,515
Guess I don't have to.

414
00:25:28,682 --> 00:25:30,362
- See you later.
- Okay.

415
00:25:31,185 --> 00:25:32,972
And we'll see you later.

416
00:26:16,165 --> 00:26:18,798
You ready to do some sucking
up to the superintendent?

417
00:26:18,965 --> 00:26:20,865
- I'd be delighted.
- Okay.

418
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,051
- Quite a turnout.
- Yes, this is quite a turnout.

419
00:26:31,218 --> 00:26:32,268
Definitely.

420
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:38,892
I was just on my way to
talk to some boosters. So...

421
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:40,557
I'll see you guys later.

422
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:44,013
See? Thasn't so bad, was it?

423
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:46,472
No, it wasn't.

424
00:26:47,313 --> 00:26:49,813
- But I'm gonna go talk to her.
- What?

425
00:26:58,571 --> 00:27:02,071
- Can I take your coats, please?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

426
00:27:02,238 --> 00:27:05,344
- Aren't you gonna be warm?
- I'd feel naked without it.

427
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:07,968
- Why?
- Because I'm naked without it.

428
00:27:08,135 --> 00:27:09,503
- What?!
- Really?

429
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:15,675
Ade and I came up with this master plan
to test mine and Liam's chemistry.

430
00:27:16,828 --> 00:27:18,720
- This was your idea?
- Not exactly

431
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,640
Did you even ask Liam
if he was coming tonight?

432
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,726
- Why wouldn't he be?
- Because he's not exactly mr. Social.

433
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,807
Something tells me Ade's plan
was not completely thought through.

434
00:27:28,974 --> 00:27:30,982
Ade's plan?! I didn't tell her
to come naked!

435
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:33,026
Yes. You practically did.

436
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,826
- Shut up!
- Drinks!

437
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,395
To enforced dress codes.

438
00:27:41,784 --> 00:27:44,378
- My God, there's rum in here.
- Yes, there is.

439
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,248
Sorry. Wasn't thinking.

440
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:48,917
- Are you okay?
- Totally.

441
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:51,628
I'm fine.
I mean, it happens.

442
00:27:52,523 --> 00:27:53,546
So, no Liam?

443
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,175
No, I haven't seen him.
Shoot. I'm getting warm.

444
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,875
Keep the jacket on.

445
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,305
I'm going to run to the ladies' room.
I will be right back.

446
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,005
We'll be over here.

447
00:28:16,727 --> 00:28:17,927
It's Adrianna.

448
00:28:19,588 --> 00:28:22,122
Something just happened, and...

449
00:28:23,313 --> 00:28:25,880
I was wondering maybe
you'd want to meet up

450
00:28:26,047 --> 00:28:28,862
because I could really
use someone to talk to.

451
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:31,729
- Sure.
- I'm at a party at the beach club.

452
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,780
Well, you're in luck.

453
00:28:34,476 --> 00:28:36,678
Nice sweater.
It's looks good on you.

454
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,593
- Everything okay?
- I don't know.

455
00:28:45,117 --> 00:28:47,602
I accidentally drank some rum and coke.
Just a sip,

456
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:50,420
- but the taste... I'm freaking out.
- Of course you are.

457
00:28:50,587 --> 00:28:54,190
It triggered something.
You start second- guessing yourself.

458
00:28:55,327 --> 00:28:58,617
Did I know there was alcohol
in the drink? Did I want to screw up?

459
00:28:58,784 --> 00:29:01,573
I took a sip and I'm still here.
It's not the end of the world.

460
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,199
Stop torturing yourself.

461
00:29:03,449 --> 00:29:05,512
No, I should have
been more responsible.

462
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,029
This is my fault.

463
00:29:07,196 --> 00:29:09,080
I'm at a party where
people are drinking.

464
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,020
This whole sober living thing...
it's a process.

465
00:29:12,187 --> 00:29:13,835
It's going to take some time.

466
00:29:18,921 --> 00:29:22,135
- Thank you.
- Excuse me. I'm so sorry to interrupt.

467
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:25,153
Can I borrow you for a second?
I would love to talk to you

468
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,320
alone.

469
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,530
Excuse me.

470
00:29:31,863 --> 00:29:35,273
Let's talk about that little crush you
have on my husband.

471
00:29:37,365 --> 00:29:39,986
There is no reason for you
to feel threatened.

472
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,236
No.

473
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,948
I'm not threatened.
I'm annoyed.

474
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:46,879
I'm sorry that you're annoyed.
That was not my intention.

475
00:29:47,046 --> 00:29:49,005
Enlighten me.
What was your intention?

476
00:29:49,172 --> 00:29:52,040
- What, to break up my marriage?
- No, absolutely not.

477
00:29:54,184 --> 00:29:56,463
I've been through a lot
with my mom lately, and

478
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,031
Harry ended up
being someone that I could talk to.

479
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:00,715
Someone that I could lean on.

480
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,986
And you're right. I shouldn't have.

481
00:30:03,544 --> 00:30:06,247
But you have to know that the minute
I felt that there was

482
00:30:06,414 --> 00:30:08,973
anything like a crush...
I hate using that word...

483
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,375
I steered clear of him.

484
00:30:12,948 --> 00:30:15,148
I did not want to cross that line.

485
00:30:16,595 --> 00:30:18,108
You have to believe me.

486
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:20,427
I'm not that person anymore.

487
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:27,329
You see that buoy down there?

488
00:30:31,007 --> 00:30:32,877
Damn. That was close.

489
00:30:33,044 --> 00:30:34,228
Not really.

490
00:30:34,607 --> 00:30:35,607
Okay.

491
00:30:35,774 --> 00:30:38,128
- You try.
- I don't want to throw rocks.

492
00:30:39,303 --> 00:30:40,303
Okay.

493
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:44,676
You want to go see a movie? They're
playing this bollywood movie <i>"3 idiots."</i>

494
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,970
No. I hate movies with subtitles.

495
00:30:47,755 --> 00:30:49,793
- Since when?
- Since forever.

496
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,933
I like to watch movies,
not read them.

497
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:55,979
You should have told me.
We've seem so many foreign films.

498
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,148
Whatever. Now you know.

499
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,681
And just so you also know,
most of the movies that we have seen,

500
00:31:01,848 --> 00:31:03,319
I actually kinda hated.

501
00:31:03,765 --> 00:31:05,065
- What?
- Yeah.

502
00:31:05,624 --> 00:31:08,535
I could barely keep my
eyes open for the most part.

503
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:10,688
I guess I was trying to impress you,

504
00:31:10,855 --> 00:31:13,121
but I just found them
incredibly boring.

505
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,539
The plots are all convoluted
and pretentious and...

506
00:31:15,706 --> 00:31:17,406
Just stop it. Just stop!

507
00:31:20,396 --> 00:31:21,936
I know what you're trying to do.

508
00:31:22,103 --> 00:31:24,507
You're trying to pick a fight.
But it's not going to work.

509
00:31:26,777 --> 00:31:28,727
I'm not going to fall for it.

510
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:31,514
I just...

511
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,390
Annie...

512
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:38,518
I love you no matter
what movies you like.

513
00:31:39,547 --> 00:31:42,247
Okay? Because we're not
like other couples.

514
00:31:43,488 --> 00:31:44,819
We're soul mates.

515
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,654
And you know what that means?

516
00:31:48,752 --> 00:31:51,155
Well, it means that soul mates...

517
00:31:52,836 --> 00:31:54,336
they're forever.

518
00:31:56,462 --> 00:31:57,462
Forever.

519
00:32:25,414 --> 00:32:27,853
Wait, aren't you
forgetting something?

520
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,456
See you at school.

521
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:56,599
You know what we need to do?

522
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,394
We need to find you a nice,
available guy.

523
00:33:01,349 --> 00:33:03,857
Preferably not an actor.

524
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:05,567
Or a teacher.

525
00:33:06,514 --> 00:33:08,069
And ideally... Straight.

526
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,489
That's not gonna be easy.

527
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,496
There's this great yoga class
you should try.

528
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,860
I might go tomorrow
if you want to come with me.

529
00:33:21,027 --> 00:33:23,858
- Sure, I'd love to.
- Good, because i think I have someone

530
00:33:24,025 --> 00:33:26,170
you just might be interested in.

531
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,797
You work fast.

532
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:33,219
Three letters... wtf...
spring to mind.

533
00:33:34,007 --> 00:33:36,014
- What?
- What the frick just happened?

534
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:39,517
It turns out her crush
wasn't about you at all.

535
00:33:44,177 --> 00:33:47,108
- It had to be a little bit about me.
- Nope.

536
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,735
Could've been anyone.

537
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,862
Could've been you, coach Cooper.

538
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,614
Lou, the gardener.

539
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,170
Lou has the mind of a child.

540
00:34:01,634 --> 00:34:04,182
It's not even the worst part.
Naomi, okay, she

541
00:34:04,349 --> 00:34:06,899
unbuttons another button
because now she's sweating.

542
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,683
I'm, like, please do not
let the ac go off tonight.

543
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:15,762
This girl, I swear, she is...

544
00:34:20,176 --> 00:34:21,526
Silver, you okay?

545
00:34:27,603 --> 00:34:29,603
It's gonna be okay, all right?

546
00:34:39,499 --> 00:34:42,830
I didn't see you at the beach club.
So, I figured I'd come here.

547
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:45,667
Cool.

548
00:34:47,492 --> 00:34:49,045
Is it hot in here?

549
00:34:50,474 --> 00:34:53,091
Maybe a little.
Let me see if the heat's on.

550
00:34:54,057 --> 00:34:55,807
I can easily turn it off.

551
00:35:12,943 --> 00:35:14,443
That was...

552
00:35:16,103 --> 00:35:17,303
I know, right?

553
00:35:19,794 --> 00:35:21,194
- Anyway.
- So...

554
00:35:21,732 --> 00:35:24,197
- No, what were you saying?
- No, nothing.

555
00:35:25,649 --> 00:35:26,821
You?

556
00:35:27,437 --> 00:35:28,437
Nothing...

557
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,408
And if you like country music,
they have sober line dancing.

558
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:45,727
Plus, sober roller-skating
and sober bar hopping.

559
00:35:46,696 --> 00:35:48,738
- Really?
- I'm just kidding.

560
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,330
Yeah, I was gonna say!

561
00:35:52,274 --> 00:35:53,693
Are you feeling any better?

562
00:35:54,422 --> 00:35:57,497
I'm feeling so much better.
Thank you so much for everything.

563
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:58,823
My pleasure.

564
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,911
- Oh no!
- What?

565
00:36:04,649 --> 00:36:07,623
My ex-girlfriend just walked in
with the new girl she's seeing.

566
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,687
I can't believe this is happening.

567
00:36:12,854 --> 00:36:15,604
She's totally flaunting
that she's moved on.

568
00:36:15,862 --> 00:36:17,759
God, I must look like such a loser.

569
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:21,175
Trust me, you don't
look like a loser. But...

570
00:36:21,952 --> 00:36:22,972
But what?

571
00:36:24,145 --> 00:36:27,226
Your ex looks jealous.
I think she thinks we're together.

572
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:30,313
I'm sure she doesn't.

573
00:36:48,169 --> 00:36:49,415
I bet she does now.

574
00:36:54,537 --> 00:36:56,662
- Why'd you do that?
- I don't know.

575
00:36:56,829 --> 00:36:59,634
You helped me out tonight,
and I wanted to help you.

576
00:37:05,753 --> 00:37:07,584
I can't believe I was
actually thinking

577
00:37:07,751 --> 00:37:10,121
about giving him another
chance after the break.

578
00:37:10,288 --> 00:37:12,313
Why can't I just get it?
He's a player.

579
00:37:12,651 --> 00:37:13,901
Silver, wait...

580
00:37:15,612 --> 00:37:17,944
There's something I gotta tell you.

581
00:37:23,995 --> 00:37:25,743
The truth is...

582
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,300
I like you.

583
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:35,586
What?

584
00:37:37,832 --> 00:37:40,341
When I said our
kiss didn't mean anything,

585
00:37:41,472 --> 00:37:42,572
I was lying.

586
00:37:43,924 --> 00:37:46,924
Couldn't stop thinking
about it during the break.

587
00:37:51,534 --> 00:37:54,584
Anything and everything I
said during the breakup,

588
00:37:55,453 --> 00:37:57,003
just forget about it.

589
00:37:58,127 --> 00:37:59,694
Because I'm crazy about you.

590
00:38:07,474 --> 00:38:09,774
Can you just give me another chance?

591
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,725


592
00:38:50,832 --> 00:38:54,415
I think you're gonna like Kai.
He's very cute, very available.

593
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,065
And very coming
towards us right now.

594
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,686
How are you?

595
00:38:59,853 --> 00:39:02,465
I noticed you weren't in class
yesterday. Is everything okay?

596
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,898
It's fine.
Harry and I just had a function.

597
00:39:05,065 --> 00:39:07,987
I want you to meet my friend, Kelly.
This is Kelly's first time here,

598
00:39:08,154 --> 00:39:10,647
- but I told her all about you.
- Nice to meet you.

599
00:39:11,112 --> 00:39:13,851
So, have you given any more thought
about the ojai retreat?

600
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,255
I think you could really
benefit from those classes.

601
00:39:16,422 --> 00:39:18,682
I don't think I'm
gonna be able to swing it, but

602
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:21,442
- Kelly might be free that weekend.
- Cool.

603
00:39:22,148 --> 00:39:23,698
I better start class.

604
00:39:25,745 --> 00:39:27,605
Well, cute, right?

605
00:39:28,062 --> 00:39:30,159
Totally, yeah, but he is

606
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,066
obviously way into you.

607
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:35,973
Don't be ridiculous.

608
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,918
He's a little touchy-feely,
but that's just his yoga shtick.

609
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,068
He does that with everybody.

610
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:45,049
Let's all take our
first position, please.

611
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:48,931
Arms to your side.

612
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:51,169
Let's close our eyes.

613
00:39:52,102 --> 00:39:53,182
Breathe in...

614
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,550
Out.

615
00:40:01,815 --> 00:40:02,865
Breathe in.

616
00:40:06,683 --> 00:40:07,683
Out.

617
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,064
What's going on?

618
00:40:20,231 --> 00:40:23,348
Apparently they're doing random locker
searches. Something to do with drugs.

619
00:40:23,515 --> 00:40:25,639
Now what do you suppose
could have prompted that?

620
00:40:25,806 --> 00:40:26,806
No idea.

621
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:30,886
31-25-32.

622
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,820
This one's clear.

623
00:40:45,481 --> 00:40:46,861
143...

624
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:48,871
32-37.

625
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:58,831
- Found something here.
- Wait a minute.

626
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,500
- Is this your locker?
- But that's impossible.

627
00:41:02,264 --> 00:41:04,213
You better come with us.
Come on

628
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,380
Let's go.

629
00:41:07,305 --> 00:41:09,805
It's not what you think.
I can explain.
