1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,070
Previously on 90210:

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,460
Ms. Silver, I'm transferring you out of this class.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,920
Mr. Matthews, what is this about?

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:10,060
Calling me "child molesting pervert" on your blog, and almost costing me my job.

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,070
Did you seen what she wrote?

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,580
She got carried away, she's a kid.

7
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,200
So... I'm back in your class?
Yes.

8
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,070
Hi, Naomi.

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,560
See that's not fair. You know my name, but I don't know yours.
Leo.

10
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,110
What if you if you send him a bottle of champagne,
telling him to meet you by the pool?

11
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,430
I just knew that I wanted to stop thinking... so I took all my mom's sleeping pills.

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,620
Annie. Tell us a story of your life. Something really painful...

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,790
I took the sleeping pills from my mom's,

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,100
in the medicine cabinet.

15
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,360
It wasn't a story, it's her life!
I know.

16
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,730
What I did was wrong, and I am ashamed of myself...

17
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,110
I love you, and I wanna be with you.

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,640
I wanted to get something permanent to symbolize our love.

19
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,280
I wanna introduce you to a student who will be joining this class.

20
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,240
You're in high school?

21
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:58,200
My mom had to sign for that bottle of champagne you sent over,
which sort of tipped her off that I wasn't enrolled here.

22
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,830
Hey, can we talk?

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,850
Look, I'm sorry I sent the champagne to your house, I
didn't mean to get you in trouble. I thought that you lived alone.

24
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,930
Whatever, it doesnt matter anyway. I just... it was a really stupid thing to do, and I'm sorry.

25
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,120
Can we start over?

26
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,220
Hey. I'm Naomi.

27
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,070
Hi, Naomi.

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,820
Turn off the phone.

29
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,480
Hello?

30
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,180
Good morning Miss Clark. It's 7:30.

31
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,550
Yes, I know. I'm... I'm wide awake. Thank you.

32
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,140
Have a nice day.
Bye.

33
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,020
The right shoe... where's my left shoe,

34
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,080
I can't find my left shoe.

35
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,670
Can't you relax?
I can't relax

36
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,360
we just had sex in the media lab.
I know, I was there.

37
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,200
What if someone had walked in?

38
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,050
It would have been jealous or impressed

39
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,600
perhaps excited, in the case of that pervert janitor with the lazy eye.

40
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,560
Well, the lazy janitor's gonna have to get his kicks elsewhere. I'm the principal's son.

41
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:09,900
I can't get caught like this.
So, media lab... much better than under the stairs, but worse than the cafeteria.

42
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,170
Where do you want to try next? Some place really freaky.

43
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,750
I think of one.
Tell me, baby.

44
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,570
How about a bed?

45
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,450
A bed? In a furniture shop?

46
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,550
No.
Oh, a sunbed?

47
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,590
A bed of roses. Huntington Gardens, I love that idea.

48
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,210
Hey, what's up?

49
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,780
Come on, don't do that to me.

50
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,860
So, uh...

51
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,830
So I have uh, a ** that Mrs. Winters is gonna give us a pop quiz today.

52
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,460
Whenever it rains, the next session gets a pop quiz.

53
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,630
Maybe, the humidity makes it vengeful, or...

54
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,700
hey, can you... wait up? Your legs are longer than mine, it's not fair.

55
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,830
Oh, sorry.

56
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,920
Ethan, is this ever gonna end?

57
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,830
What?
This.

58
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,220
This... you being mad at me,

59
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,550
and me apologizing over and over and over again.

60
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,060
You can stop apologizing, I hear you.

61
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,200
Then what? What is it?

62
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,030
I don't know.

63
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,720
I just... feel like... I don't know... like I don't know you.

64
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,180
Because of this one thing?

65
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,980
Because I told Rhonda's story?

66
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,570
When I was watching you tell her story, I was horrifying but...

67
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,830
I was also impressed.

68
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,100
You are really a very good actress, Annie.

69
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,150
I had no idea who you were.

70
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,530
And that makes me wonder who we are.

71
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,620
So try to think about these poems in terms of positive and negative space.

72
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,960
The positive space is the... it's the

73
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,410
words, and the negative space is the meaning that we impose on those words.

74
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,500
You know, rarely there's a poem come right out, and say something straight forward

75
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,480
No kidding. That's the problem.

76
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,450
Not a problem...

77
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,150
it's a beauty.

78
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,990
You know, it's up to us to interpret poems, to understand them, to make them valid.

79
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,580
So, please... I beg you

80
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,490
don't let your poems down.

81
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,090
Not that any of you will wait till the last minute but

82
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,930
just a friendly reminder: your poetry presentation is due begin tomorrow.

83
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:21,050
I gotta say: I am loving this assigment Matthews!

84
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,400
When do we lose the "Mr"? Do I not command respect?

85
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,540
This poem that you assigned me, I absolutely love it.

86
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,770
Lord Byron.
But I'll be straight with you.

87
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,870
I never really liked love poems before you know,

88
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,570
they're so like over the top and... and grandiose

89
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,100
or sappy or full of crap, you know?

90
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,480
I will take that as a metaphor.

91
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,260
I never really got them you know.

92
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,720
It's, like, my love is like a rose.

93
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,370
Your eyes are like a filthy swimming pool.

94
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,470
Not familiar with that one.

95
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,870
Poetry was this foreign language to me, okay?

96
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
But now, I get it.

97
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,410
And I don't know if it's because I actually know what love is,

98
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:03,100
or because you somehow broke through this
thick skull of mine, but suddenly, these poems...

99
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,240
It's, like, they're not gibberish anymore.

100
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,940
Love is like a rose.

101
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,670
It is.

102
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,090
Silver, I do believe you're inspired.

103
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,040
Yeah, I also believe you could lay off the coffee a little bit.

104
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,550
Okay, I wanted to check with you.

105
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,990
I want to show a film as my presentation.

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,670
I've been working on it, and I'm fairly sure it's going to blow your mind.

107
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,220
Sounds good. I take it you're familiar with all the equipment in the media lab?

108
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,700
You have no idea how familiar I am with that equipment.

109
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,910
What formula would you use to find the volume, hmm?

110
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,230
Mr. Court. So glad you've decided to join us.

111
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,500
Would you like to tell us what formula you
would use to find the volume of a triangular prism?

112
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,060
No idea.

113
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:54,450
It's one-half times length times width times height.

114
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,720
That ring a bell?

115
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,600
Nope.

116
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,650
Well, where did you leave off in your last math class?

117
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,960
Do you know how to figure out the area of a rectangle?

118
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,750
How to classify triangles?

119
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,730
Okay, well, it looks like you have to play a little catch-up.

120
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,210
Who would like to go over past exams with liam?

121
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,550
For extra credit, of course.

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,060
You?

123
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,110
I could really use the extra credit.

124
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,660
Okay.

125
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,710
What kind of guy drop out of high school to work as a bartender?

126
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,480
I mean, what kind of guy barely speaks to you

127
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,080
before he throws you up against a wall and starts to...

128
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,600
Show you the banana in his pants?

129
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,280
Yeah, that was a dream.

130
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,860
I know that, okay?

131
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,680
I don't have a lot to work with. He's a complete enigma.

132
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,350
Well, you know what they say.

133
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,570
The way to a man's heart is through math.

134
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,620
What was I supposed to do? I have to get him to forgive me.

135
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,110
I mean, if it was Ethan, I'd just give him pot stickers.

136
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,120
Those always put him in a good mood.

137
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,040
God, but I don't know anything about Liam.

138
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,770
I mean, I don't know where he stands
on the whole pot sticker spectrum.

139
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,520
Okay, well, putting a pin in the pot sticker issue...

140
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,610
Did you Google him?

141
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,950
Um, hi. Of course I did. He has no digital footprints.

142
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,940
No MySpace, no Facebook.

143
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,510
Well, how does he superpoke people?

144
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,240
He's a complete mystery.

145
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,280
Josh in my history class says he's in a gang.

146
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:45,090
No, no, no, no. That doesn't seem right at all. He's a complete loner.

147
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,110
And I definitely couldn't see him wearing a doo rag.

148
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,970
Did you hear about the cooking meth rumor?

149
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,570
Yeah, from Sally.

150
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,020
She also said she went on a date with Rob Pattinson.

151
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,250
Yeah, she's clearly full of it.

152
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,760
Hopefully, I'll find out so real information from
him today during the tutoring session.

153
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,150
Yeah, not this afternoon, you won't.

154
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,140
Your enigma viis dring away.

155
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,570
Hey, Spielberg, I got to get through.

156
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,390
Enjoy.

157
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,240
Here. Look at me. Look at me.

158
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,900
And... got it. Now I'm dizzy.

159
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,050
So, what was that shot for?

160
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,860
Okay, that's a shot when the heroine experiences love for the first time,

161
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,150
you know, and her entire world just starts spinning.

162
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,330
That's pretty cool.

163
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,940
Far be it from me to toot my own horn, but...

164
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,500
By all means. Toot away.

165
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,660
Dixon, it's crazy.

166
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,650
The moment that I decided to do the poem as a film,

167
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,940
this whole entire concept just came to me.

168
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:05,350
Scene by scene and shot by shot, I knew
exactly what I wanted to do, you know?

169
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,170
I can't wait for you to see it.

170
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,160
What's next?

171
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,980
Uh, well, I do need to refuel.

172
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,300
So, what can I get you?

173
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,300
How about...

174
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,390
An order of Dixon?

175
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,990
Dressing on the side?

176
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,190
Hey, you and me in the storage room,right now.

177
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,430
I'm working.

178
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,800
You work in a service industry,right?

179
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,500
All right, you know, I gotta go on break in a minute, so...

180
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,660
You don't think this is too big for the kitchen?

181
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,630
No.

182
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,510
Did I ever tell you that you are the love of my life?

183
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,790
I think the last time was when I was carrying
a gigantic teak bookshelf up the stairs.

184
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,910
What can I say?

185
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,500
Seeing you carry heavy objects reminds me how much I love you.

186
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,650
That plant is too big for the kitchen.

187
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,060
Annie!
What are you doing home?

188
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,280
You're supposed to be at rehearsal.

189
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,360
I... I quit.

190
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,050
What?

191
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,580
Why would you quit?

192
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:09,320
You know, it was such a small part.

193
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,140
It really wasn't worth my time.

194
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:15,380
Well, come on, what is it they say? There
are no small parts, just small actors.

195
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,830
Yeah, well, whoever said that got the lead.

196
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:23,200
Besides, I'm not sure that being in the
play is good for me and Ethan, so...

197
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,230
What do you mean?

198
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,140
It's not a big deal, okay?

199
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,040
There will be other plays.

200
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,990
And I just need to focus on my relationship right now.

201
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,000
Do something.

202
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:40,140
What do you want me to do? Tackle her and force her to go to rehearsal?

203
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,720
I don't know. But she should be focusing on herself

204
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,200
and... and what's important to her and not making decisions based on some boy.

205
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,400
I agree.

206
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,480
Well, then, let's do something.

207
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,450
Ground her or forbid her from seeing Ethan.

208
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,600
Honey, really?

209
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,790
No!

210
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,100
Yes. I don't, I don't know. And don't "honey" me.

211
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,760
She is making a huge mistake. And you are refusing to do anything about it.

212
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,730
And that plant is way too big for the kitchen.

213
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,540
Geez, Matthews, you scared me.

214
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,830
Sorry about that.

215
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,830
Uh, I'm just taking off for the night. I wanted to see how you're doing.

216
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,430
I... I'm great, actually.

217
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,860
This project has made me realize that I want to be a filmmaker.

218
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,350
I'm going to make movies.

219
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,490
Wow, that's cool.

220
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,700
You know, I gotta say, I like movies better than blogs.

221
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,670
It totally makes sense.I...

222
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,440
I've always been a sual person, it's just, I'm crap at painting and drawing.

223
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,830
So, film is this perfect medium for me.

224
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,650
You know, I don't have to create the image, I just
have to capture it and then connect them.

225
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,710
Well, just thank me at the oscars.

226
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,580
You got it.

227
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,590
So, look...

228
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,920
I know everybody gets ten minutes for their
presentation, but I can't cut it down to that.

229
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,840
I mean, maybe if I make some really big
trims I can get it down to 45 minutes.

230
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,970
What do you think?

231
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,700
Are you out of your mind?

232
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,520
Aim for ten. All right?

233
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,500
We have other students in the class.

234
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,800
You just lost your oscar shout out.

235
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,990
Well, I'll survive.

236
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,670
Oh, good, you're awake.

237
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,510
Silver, what are you doing here?

238
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,990
Morning, baby.

239
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,040
I'm gonna rock your world.

240
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,700
Wait, uh...

241
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,370
Um, what are you doing?

242
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,700
What do you think?

243
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,390
I don't know.

244
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,150
Wait, you wanna have sex? Here?

245
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,300
You're the one who wanted to do it in a bed.

246
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,640
Yeah, but my parents are right down the hall sleeping.

247
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,200
That's funny, I didn't sleep a wink.

248
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,100
But I finished my movie. And baby... it's a masterpiece.

249
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,430
Now, I'm ready to celebrate.

250
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,020
Whoa, hey, Silver. Uh, take it easy.

251
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,360
My movie, it's all about love! And you are my inspiration.

252
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,360
Um, well, um, let me inspire you later, cool?

253
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,750
Dixon, you are gonna freak out when you see my film.

254
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,290
I mean, of course I ran into a little glitch '

255
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,730
cause Matthews is insisting on the under-ten-minute thing.

256
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,320
But then I realized, it's gonna be wasted on a classroom anyway.

257
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:35,390
So, I'm gonna rent a theater!
A... are you kidding?

258
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,520
I mean, it's a little bit expensive, but it's a huge investment for my future

259
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:40,080
and you're gonna come to the screening, right?

260
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:45,490
Um, yeah, yeah, um, long as my parents don't find you in here.

261
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,260
'Cause dead people can't go to screenings, you know.

262
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,300
You are so cute when you're nervous.

263
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,860
I'm much much, much less cute if I'm dead, trust me.

264
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,240
That's fine,fine.

265
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,990
I wonder if scorsese has such a hard time getting morning action.

266
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,780
It's gonna be amazing!

267
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,660
Love you!

268
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,390
I love you,too.

269
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,500
Come on, come on.

270
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,790
You will give me coffee.

271
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,860
Morning, dad.

272
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,000
When the machines finally wage war against their human oppressors

273
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,170
do you think that they are gonna start big... super computers, subway system,

274
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,030
or do you think they're gonna send out the foot soldiers?

275
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,060
You know, electric pencil sharpeners, digital clocks, coffee makers.

276
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,520
Coffee makers?
Never mind.

277
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,740
Just the ravings of a caffeine-deprived luddite.

278
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,980
You all right?

279
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,870
Yeah, yeah, sure. Just... just thinking.

280
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,820
You know, why is it so hard to understand women?

281
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:40,880
And thus the beginnings of another classic comedy routine.

282
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:43,020
Sorry, mom, no offense.

283
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,900
None taken.

284
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,000
What's with the coffee maker?

285
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,590
I think it's busted.

286
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,410
Women troubles?

287
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,920
No, no, no, no, no, uh...

288
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,480
Silver's just very emotional.

289
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,660
You know, she's so over the top with things.

290
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,950
Well, she is a teenager.

291
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,010
And a woman.

292
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,590
What's that supposed to mean?

293
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,490
Have you tried plugging it in?

294
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,060
See? Women may be crazy emotional, but
sometimes they are great with gadgets.

295
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,950
You think women are crazy emotional?

296
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,320
Well, come on, hon.

297
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,600
That thing with annie yesterday.You got upset with me for no good reason.

298
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,960
It struck a nerve.

299
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:20,250
This whole idea of a young woman giving up
what she cares about for the man in her life.

300
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,630
I guess sometimes I just feel like I've given up too much of my photography.

301
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,820
Well, I...

302
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,060
I never wanted you to give up anything.
I know.

303
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:31,310
I wanted to take a bit of a break to help us
get adjusted to California and everything.

304
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,630
But now I'm missing it.

305
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,880
Somewhere there's that elusive balance between family and career.

306
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:40,700
And right now that balance is a little t off.

307
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,170
Went to school.

308
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,580
Peace, D.

309
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,300
I think that we missed the opportunity to
give a very inspirational parental pep talk.

310
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,300
Rhonda.

311
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,500
Hey, look, sorry I've been sort of...

312
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,680
Avoiding you, but I just...

313
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,530
Wanted to sort things out in my head before I talked to you.

314
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,650
Okay, so you're all sorted then?

315
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,480
I have a girlfriend.

316
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:34,530
And yes, we're going through a rocky
patch, but we're trying to work it out.

317
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,240
Great, well, I'm thrilled for you both.

318
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,580
No, I still want us to be friends, though.

319
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:43,200
Well, I'm sorry, Ethan, but it's not up to you.

320
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,700
Being friends is not what I want.

321
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,620
We had a connection, and you can deny it all you want.

322
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,580
But it was still there.

323
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,550
No, I'm not denying it.

324
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,900
But I'm with Annie.

325
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,700
And that's that.

326
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,950
Well, I can't just pretend that I don't have feelings for you.

327
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,000
And that's that.

328
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,320
So, where does that leave us?

329
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,660
I guess that we're just...

330
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,690
Not friends.

331
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,380
What are you doing here?

332
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,450
I'm here to tutor you, remember?

333
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,250
You ditched me yesterday.

334
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,450
That's 'cause I don't need a tutor.

335
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,790
Look, Liam, I'm really sorry about the champagne.

336
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,500
I feel really bad.

337
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,910
It was an honest mistake.

338
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,680
I didn't mean to get you in trouble.

339
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,030
Can we just start over?

340
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,940
Hi, I'm Naomi.

341
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,650
What do you want from me...

342
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,750
Naomi?
Nothing.

343
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,600
So, why are you here?

344
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:02,820
I'm here to tutor you in math. Of course.

345
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,100
Of course.

346
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,800
Well, knock yourself out.

347
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:14,660
Great, um, so, we'll just ,uh, start with the basics.

348
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,500
We're studying angles.

349
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,190
There's different types of angles.

350
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,730
These two are not acute.

351
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,150
Not acute?

352
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,380
No, they, um...

353
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,150
acute angles are less than 180...

354
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,780
less than 90 degrees, I mean.

355
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,500
Uh, these are congruent.

356
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,680
Supplementary.
What?

357
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,530
Interior angles on the same side of the transversal are supplementary.

358
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,470
They need to be on opposite sides of the transversal to be congruent.

359
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,370
How do you know that?

360
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,690
I told you.

361
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,250
I don't need a tutor.

362
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:51,010
Now, I would love to hear you take a whack
at obtuse angles, but I got to take off.

363
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,350
So, how about you get off my car?

364
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,420
What do you say you take me with you?

365
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,400
It's not your kind of scene.

366
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,920
I'm willing to take that risk.

367
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,720
Fine.

368
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,340
But don't say I didn't warn you.

369
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,500
You're in for a long ride.

370
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,700
Please un-quit the play.

371
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,910
We desperately, desperately need you.

372
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,250
I can't.

373
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,490
Why not?

374
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,730
This whole acting thing, it's messing with me.

375
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,210
Doesn't it feel weird constantly putting yourself in someone else's brain?

376
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,250
Are you kidding?

377
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,750
I love it.It takes me out of my own.

378
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:47,520
Yeah, well, I... I don't want to forget who I am right now. I can't.

379
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,300
I got to get back to being the girl that Ethan fell in love with.

380
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,340
This is about Ethan.

381
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,650
Kind of.

382
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,560
We're having problems.

383
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,370
Um, something really bad happened the night of the valentine's dance.

384
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,390
Yeah, I know, I heard.

385
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,400
You did? How?

386
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,960
Well, Navid, he kind of saw.

387
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,990
Navid saw?

388
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,310
Wait, what are you... what are you talking about?

389
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,650
You first. What exactly did Navid see?

390
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,620
Oh, I... well, I don't even know if it's... it's true.

391
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,470
Navid's vision does weird things at night.
Adrianna...

392
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,450
He thought he saw a baby alien once, and it turned out to be a squirrel.

393
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:27,400
Adrianna, what did he see?

394
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:36,900
He saw Ethan and Rhonda kissing in the parking lot after the valentine's day dance.

395
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,720
I cannot believe you fooled around with my boyfriend.

396
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,910
Um, can we... can we go somewhere?
You are such a hypocrite, the both of you.

397
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,800
Going... going around talking about honesty and how the accident changed you

398
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:05,830
and all the great things you want to do to expand your horizons.

399
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,050
Little did I know that expanding your horizons was
actually code for becoming a lying, cheating whore.

400
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,680
Okay, look, I am not that kind of girl.

401
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,280
I thought you guys were over.

402
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,970
Well, guess what, we're not.

403
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,020
Yeah, I know.

404
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,690
Ethan explained that things have been
kind of rocky between you two.

405
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,450
He also said that as long as he had a girlfriend
that nothing was gonna happen between us.

406
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,190
Great.

407
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,470
So, you're just lying around, ready to pounce?

408
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,530
No, of course not.

409
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:35,520
I totally get why you're mad, but this isn't a conversation to have with me.

410
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,800
It's a conversation you need to have with your boyfriend.

411
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,200
It's me.

412
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,490
I heard about you and your valentine.

413
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:47,150
I'm so angry, I can't even find words.

414
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,630
Except I can.

415
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,650
Yeah, a couple.

416
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,990
Like "liar" and "cheater.

417
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,430
Great work tonight, you especially. Excellent.

418
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,680
Ms. Casey?

419
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,210
Hi, um...

420
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:01,350
so, look, I... I made a mistake in quitting the play.

421
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,300
I don't even know what I was thinking.

422
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:08,940
Well, I do, but I think differently now, and I
would really like to play Charmian again.

423
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,650
Is it too late?

424
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,100
I'm sorry, Annie.

425
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,830
Cammy Zuggler is... is now playing Charmian.

426
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,450
Maybe next semester.

427
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,730
Are you okay?

428
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,690
She wouldn't let me back in the play.

429
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,240
No, I meant about the Ethan stuff.

430
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,400
I'm really sorry.

431
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,300
Why?

432
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,250
You didn't kiss Rhonda.

433
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,660
Yo, Annie.

434
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,830
Juno.

435
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,190
A bunch of us are going to go hang at Griffith Park.

436
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,150
You want in?

437
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,780
Negatory. I have a date with Navid.

438
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,170
Annie?

439
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,130
I'll go.

440
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,400
Hey, it's me.

441
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,570
I heard about you and your valentine.

442
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,110
Hey, what's going on?

443
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,920
It's good to see you.

444
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,310
Hey, Mary, hey, Kendra.

445
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,330
Welcome.

446
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,990
Thanks.
Hi, ladies.

447
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,470
Where is everyone? I put a big invite on my blog.

448
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,390
Well, it was kind of last minute.

449
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,560
Our school is full of losers.

450
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,130
What could they possibly have going on tonight?

451
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,450
Sir Matthews, welcome.

452
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,050
Way to get around the time limit.

453
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,740
Well, I didn't want to butcher the narrative.

454
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,840
Yeah, well...

455
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,620
Geez, I'm excited.

456
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,440
Oh, I have an idea.

457
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,450
Um, will you do, like, a little introduction before the film?

458
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,620
You know, like... kind of like they do at the arclight?

459
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,270
Yeah, sure, why not?

460
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,600
You are the best teacher ever.

461
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:09,500
I've been trying to reach you oh, oh...

462
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:12,030
So, when did you stop going to school?

463
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:17,100
Oh, me and my mom moved here in January, so...January.

464
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,820
How did you do it?

465
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,310
She told me to enroll at West Beverly.

466
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,350
I didn't.

467
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,030
How were you gonna cover up all the report cards and stuff like that?

468
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,420
My mom's not really the report card type.

469
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,160
So long as I'm going, she's happy.

470
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,350
When she found out I wasn't...

471
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,780
Not so happy.

472
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:37,440
I don't get it. I mean, you're obviously smart. Why not go to school?

473
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,700
School bores me.

474
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,140
The bell rings, and the cattle move from room to room every 45 minutes.

475
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,270
I'm all for learning.

476
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,530
Just not exactly what they want me
to learn or how they want me to learn it.

477
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:53,180
See, I'm an autodidact.

478
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,210
Means self-taught.

479
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,130
Yeah, I know what it means.

480
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,160
Sure.

481
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:05,050
There's a whole world of knowledge and experience
out there, things that you don't learn at school.

482
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,880
That's what I'm interested in.

483
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,190
So, where are we, exactly?

484
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,700
A long way from Beverly Hills.

485
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,400
You scared?

486
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:38,620
What?

487
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,000
No, of course not.

488
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:42,370
Then why are you clutching your purse so tight?

489
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,800
This purse happens to be worth more than your car.

490
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,490
This is a v-8 engine.

491
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,570
360 horsepower, 500 pounds of torque on tap.

492
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,480
I can guarantee it's worth more than that purse.

493
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:03,900
Naomi, I'm about to race these guys, so your little adventure ends here.

494
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,080
Drag racing.

495
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:08,330
That's what you autodidact yourself about?

496
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,040
Racing is physics.

497
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,740
And math.

498
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,720
And a hell of a lot of fun.

499
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,960
But it's also dangerous and illegal, so I'm going to call you a cab.

500
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,250
What do you think?

501
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,700
I think...

502
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:27,340
I'd rather go for a ride.

503
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,460
Uh, hello, everybody.

504
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,840
Uh, I would like to introduce the first film, uh, from a new auteur.

505
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,550
The, uh, inspirational...

506
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,160
the enthusiastic...

507
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,850
the unusual Erin Silver.

508
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,700
Um, uh, it's been a pleasure teaching her and, um...

509
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,310
and... and I look forward to teaching her more in the future.

510
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,100
And you what that said, enjoy.

511
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,440
Can't wait to see it.

512
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,970
She walks in beauty

513
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,590
That's pretty cool.

514
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,600
I'm in it?

515
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,360
I love you.

516
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,010
Oh, my God!

517
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,530
You filmed us having sex?

518
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,980
Are you upset?

519
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,360
I love you.

520
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,900
What's wrong with you?

521
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:40,540
Allright, that's enough, let's shut it down.

522
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:43,470
Dixon, Dixon.

523
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,410
Wait!

524
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,690
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

525
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,290
Come on! Go faster!

526
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,840
Go! Faster! Faster!

527
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,150
Go!Go!

528
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,000
Oh, my God, he's gaining on us!

529
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:13,820
Floor it!

530
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:16,680
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

531
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,190
Oh, my God.

532
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:40,880
That was so fast.

533
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,910
That's the idea.

534
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,550
So, what's next?

535
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:47,790
Beer.

536
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,200
Do you guys have wine spritzers?

537
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,990
That was a joke.

538
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,130
Dixon!

539
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:02,950
Wait!

540
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,170
Please!

541
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,330
I honestly thought that you would like my movie, okay?

542
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,680
You thought I would like it?

543
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:10,770
It's about our love, us connecting. Don't you see...

544
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,430
What I saw was that you hid a camera and filmed us having sex.

545
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,690
And then showed it to everyone.

546
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,840
But Dixon, it's not...

547
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,330
You have no boundaries!

548
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,410
I didn't think that I needed to haar boundies!

549
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,650
I thought that we were in love!

550
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,380
You know what, Silver?

551
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,390
Just stay away from me. Just stay away from me.

552
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,990
No! No!

553
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,260
I'll destroy the movie. I will.

554
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,590
Just don't be mad at me, okay?

555
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,050
Please do not be mad at me.

556
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,990
I, I am in love with you, Dixon...

557
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,980
Are you out of your mind?

558
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,850
Can I help you with that?

559
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,630
Thank you.

560
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,930
What do I get in return?

561
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:20,650
For slobbering all over my beer? I'll go with nothing.

562
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,990
Hey, I'm Milo.

563
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,670
Naomi.Please excuse me.

564
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,900
Wait, where you going, Naomi?

565
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,400
Oh, man, what's your problem?

566
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,910
I don't have a problem.

567
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,880
You do.

568
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,420
Let's go, Naomi.

569
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,020
Something to help you find balance.

570
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,560
It's a lens.

571
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:52,120
You are an amazing photographer.

572
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,050
And you need to stick with it.

573
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,350
Thank you.
You're welcome.

574
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,990
Good lens?

575
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,740
Yeah, I... I think it's a lens for a video camera, actually.

576
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,550
But it's a beautiful lens.

577
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,820
Are you all right?

578
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,970
Yeah, I'm fine.

579
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,990
Your soup is burning.

580
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,120
No, it's not.

581
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,460
But something is.

582
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,260
What the hell?
Oh, my God!

583
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,390
What's going on, Dixon?

584
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,420
The stars seem so far away.

585
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,630
I know.

586
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:51,240
Like little pinholes.

587
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,990
Can I say something?

588
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,790
Ms. Casey is a nazi.

589
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:07,260
Shush. You, shush!

590
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,260
Having fun with my girlfriend?

591
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:14,150
So, I'm still your girlfriend, then?

592
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,400
Because Rhonda seems to think that we're going through a rocky patch.

593
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,090
You know what? I'm...

594
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,450
Let you guys handle this.

595
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,760
What were you doing with that guy?

596
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,870
I was not kissing him.

597
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,740
I'm sorry.

598
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,340
But I didn't kiss Rhonda. She kissed me.

599
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,410
I... I should have told you.

600
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:33,440
Oh, why bother being honest when you
could just spend your time giving me hell?

601
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:36,360
I've been apologizing every day, Ethan!

602
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,220
I've been apologizing to you in my sleep.

603
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:42,640
I... I even gave up being in the stupid play because of you.

604
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,730
You quit the play? Why?

605
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:47,990
Because I was trying to convince myself that that was the problem.

606
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,660
I wanted that to be the problem.

607
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:54,470
Because if... if that's not it, then what is our problem?

608
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,040
I don't know!

609
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,590
Look, I don't want to keep fighting.

610
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,090
Me, neither.

611
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,900
Let's...

612
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,700
end this.

613
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,830
We're in... in two different places.

614
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,740
It's... it's not your fault.

615
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,450
It's because we've grown apart.

616
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:19,780
And... I did feel something with Rhonda.

617
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,480
Oh, my God.

618
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,260
You're going to go out with Rhonda.

619
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,410
This is not about Rhonda.

620
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,800
I've had girlfriends since I was 12 years old.

621
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:39,940
And I don't want a girlfriend right now.

622
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:45,810
I need to figure out who I am...

623
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,280
alone.

624
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:10,590
I guess you were right.

625
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,170
That, uh, that was not my scene.

626
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,800
Hey, Kelly, uh, it's Ryan.

627
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,840
Listen, I need you to call me back.

628
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:04,750
Uh, Silver made a film and, uh...

629
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,770
yeah, I don't really want to get into it on your machine.

630
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,460
So just call me back.

631
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,600
Silver.

632
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,620
You didn't think I'd put it together, did you?

633
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,160
What? What are you doing?

634
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:33,360
No, just stop talking! Stop!

635
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,460
It was a nice try, Matthews.

636
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,480
You think that I'm dumb?

637
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,600
Well, I am not dumb!

638
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:44,990
It took me a little while, but I figured out what you were up to.

639
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:49,530
You said to me that you liked movies better than blogs.

640
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:53,770
You think you could possibly be referring to the blog that I posted about you?

641
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,600
I wonder.

642
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,880
You never got over it,did you?

643
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,970
You pretended to... you pretended to forgive me.

644
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,580
You even invited me back into your classroom.

645
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,620
All so that you could encourage me to make this movie.

646
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,400
This was all a set-up.

647
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,350
Silver...
No, stop!

648
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,550
Drop the puppy dog face!I'm over it!

649
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,850
I know that you don't want me to succeed.

650
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,890
All you wanted was revenge.

651
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,240
Listen to me.

652
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,630
You know that's not true.

653
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,340
You managed to turn Dixon against me.

654
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,950
You've managed to ruin my relationship,

655
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,970
the one think that I care the most about

656
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,130
in this entire world

657
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,400
Wait, wait, Dixon?
Stay away from me!

658
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,980
Do you wanna how I figured it out?

659
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:44,730
Last night in the media lab you said to me,

660
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:47,650
are you out of your mind?

661
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:54,050
And then tonight, Dixon just now said to me, are you out of your mind?

662
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,450
That is not a coincidence!

663
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,960
You got to Dixon!

664
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,460
You told him lies about me!

665
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,960
All so that you could teach me a lesson.

666
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,590
What kind of teacher are you?

667
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,900
Silver, listen...

668
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:12,170
Okay. What do you want from me?

669
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,390
I... want... you...

670
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,420
to fix all of this!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
