1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,679
Previewly on 90210

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,470
Teachers cannot be alone off campus with students.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,700
Kim's not a student.

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,950
I'm going to have to ask you

5
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,160
to take a paid leave of absence.

6
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,040
I decided to read Silver's blog.

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,040
They think I'm a sleazeball, they really do.

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,960
Any girl would be lucky to have a chance

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,520
with someone like you.

10
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,680
Remember, when you're out there,just look at me.

11
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,160
When you're onstage,there's nobody else.

12
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,800
I love you.

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,920
I don't know what to say.

14
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,160
Don't say anything.

15
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:27,520
Just forget it.

16
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,040
What I have to say something back

17
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,560
Screw you, Dixon!

18
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,680
I'm pregnant.

19
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,680
You want to have this baby,

20
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,560
I'll go with you to Lamaze class.

21
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,640
If you don't want to have it

22
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,680
I'll take you to the clinic.

23
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,120
And if you can't decide,

24
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,123
I'll sit with you until you can.





29
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,040
It's great to have you back,Ryan.

30
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,800
Listen, that seminar up in Berkeley

31
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,480
that you wanted to go to next month

32
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,460
It took some doing

33
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,400
but I got the school board to clear it.

34
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,800
Air fare and hotel.

35
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,440
I mean, don't book the Biltmore or anything,

36
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,960
but you're going.

37
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,080
You know what,send someone else.

38
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,440
Are you sure

39
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,160
That's all you could talk about last fall.

40
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,960
I got to be honest with you, Harry.

41
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,840
I don't know how much longer I'm going to be teaching.

42
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,640
What do you mean

43
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,480
I just think I was a little naive when I started here.

44
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,920
and reach the kids

45
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,160
and that didn't really work out too well, did it

46
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,520
I think my Dead Poet Society days are over.

47
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,320
I'm just going to do a job and cash a paycheck.

48
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,120
You've had a rough couple of months.

49
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,800
Let's just see how things go.

50
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,160
Ryan...

51
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,720
I mean Mr. Matthews.

52
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,760
You're back.

53
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,120
So it seems.

54
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,760
I'm surprised to see you.

55
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,280
You didn't call or anything.

56
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,640
Was I supposed to

57
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,120
No, no.  no.

58
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,160
Maybe we could have lunch or something.

59
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
I don't think that's a great idea.

60
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,160
Ah, the theater.

61
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,840
You gonna run lights again

62
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,000
Uh, I don't know.

63
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,880
Well, Silver's stage managing.

64
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,160
So it's a yes

65
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,160
So that's an I don't know.

66
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,840
You guys doing okay*

67
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,000
Pretending to be anyway.

68
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,520
That's cryptic

69
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,520
Hey, why don't you go say hi to Annie.

70
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,240
See ya.Later.

71
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,040
"Say to great Caesar this:

72
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,160
"in deputation I kiss his conquering hand;

73
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,640
tell him I am prompt to lay my crown at his feet."

74
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,600
That is some fancy talk right there, missy.

75
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,560
I know, right

76
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,480
So poetic, so eloquent.

77
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,120
So... Shakespearean.

78
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,480
I'm so glad the new drama teacher chose this play.

79
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,000
God, I want to play her so bad.

80
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,680
- Who  - Cleopatra.

81
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh, right, yeah, of course.

82
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,240
No, I think you'd be great as her.

83
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,760
You do

84
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,560
I mean, I'd love to.

85
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,520
It's a role I alwaysthought I'd play, eventually.

86
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,160
Not necessarily in high school though,

87
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,000
but you know, when opportunity knocks...

88
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,400
You'd better answer.

89
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,560
You know, my grandma was up for the movie role,

90
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,520
but she said that Elizabeth Taylor stole her part

91
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,520
"that violet-eyed hussy."

92
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,560
Okay, good luck, everyone.

93
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,380
I should mention that

94
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,160
we'll be using lots of strobe effects,

95
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,680
so please don't audition if you're epileptic, okay

96
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,380
Ms. Casey, I have to tell you,

97
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,560
I saw the Equus you directed at the Red Cat.

98
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:20,600
Stop right there

99
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,320
You want to brownnose,

100
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,040
kiddo, wash my car, okay

101
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,760
Wilson, right

102
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,040
Yeah. Hi.

103
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,280
I watched a video of you in Spring Awakening.

104
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,520
You were the understudy, right

105
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,000
Pretty damn impressive

106
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,200
stepping in like that.

107
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,000
Well, the show much go on,right

108
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,200
I look forward to your audition.

109
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,880
"I am prompt to lay my crown at your feet."

110
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,280
Did you see that? She winked at me.

111
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,040
Yeah. No, I don't know if there's betting in theater,

112
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,680
but I'd say you've got pretty good odds.

113
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,600
You know what, you should audition, too.

114
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,880
You'd be done before baseball,

115
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,880
- and it'd be fun.  - No.

116
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,380
Oh, come on. Otherwise we're never going to

117
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,720
get to spend time together.

118
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,360
I'm going to be rehearsing like every day.

119
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm not... an actor.

120
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,640
Well, there are tons of small parts.

121
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,240
No, I shouldn't say that.

122
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,040
There are no small parts,only small actors.

123
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,120
There are tons of less time-consuming parts,

124
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,200
shall we say.

125
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,840
Yeah, I don't know.

126
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,200
I mean, five minutes onstage in front of people,

127
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,480
I start sweating

128
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,760
more than I do in an entire lacrosse game.

129
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,320
Pretty please.

130
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,600
You would make an excellent Egyptian slave boy.

131
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,720
Seriously.

132
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,240
I'd summon you to my chamber.

133
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,320
That's an enticing offer.

134
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,080
Enticing.

135
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,840
Hey, that looks like a nutritious breakfast.

136
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,360
There's nuts.That's a protein.

137
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,240
So what's going on

138
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,000
Things are crazy.

139
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,480
My schedule's totally insane.

140
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,160
My commercial agent just called.

141
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,800
I got to go in today at 3:00

142
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,280
for some toothpaste commercial.

143
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,400
"Because for your teeth,white is right."

144
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,240
And tomorrow it's the Antony and Cleopatra audition.

145
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,760
And I so want Cleopatra.

146
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,600
It's such a dark,tragic role,

147
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,880
and I've never done anything like it before.

148
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,500
So I'm going to be up all night

149
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,120
with Will Shakes studying.

150
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,000
Sounds like you're really busy.

151
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,800
I know, it's total chaos.

152
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,400
I really hope I don't smile

153
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,280
during my Cleopatra suicide monologue

154
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,680
or kill myself during my toothpaste commercial.

155
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,680
I need another coffee.

156
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,360
More coffee

157
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,200
Are you sure that's a good Idea, Ades

158
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,840
Because of the toothpaste commercial

159
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,680
Two coffees won't stain my teeth.

160
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,120
No, because you're pregnant.

161
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,160
Ade, remember

162
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,160
Look, have you been to the doctor at least?

163
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,960
You said you would go last week.

164
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,880
I-I've been busy.

165
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,360
Can't you see?

166
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,480
I mean, I would have gone today, but the commercial.

167
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,320
- Hey, can I get one more?  - Sure.

168
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,560
Well, tomorrow?

169
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,880
Tomorrow is the school audition.

170
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,840
Oh, can you lend me a dollar?

171
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,780
You know what, Ade,

172
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,720
you really have to deal with this, okay*

173
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,480
- There you go.  - Thanks.

174
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,080
I got to get off-book.

175
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,440
Good to see you back, dude.

176
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,000
How was South Korea?

177
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,080
It was South Dakota. It was fine.

178
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,840
Hey, so, Mr. Matthews,

179
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,600
does the cop use her handcuffs in bed?

180
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,880
I'm going to need you all to take your seats

181
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,760
in alphabetical order.

182
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,320
Seriously

183
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,360
Seriously. Name cards are on your desks.

184
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,280
Sit, now.

185
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,640
Mr.Matthews,I think the mountain air pickled your brain

186
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,360
because you forgot me.

187
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,200
Straight from Saberi to Sondheimer.

188
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,560
Ms. Silver, I am transferring you out of this class.

189
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,640
Excuse me?

190
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,400
I've already filled out the forms.

191
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,160
I've discussed it with Principal Wilson.

192
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,560
You will be in Mr. Kaplan's English class.

193
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,800
He's the worst teacher here.

194
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,480
The dude calls Tom Clancy "The Bard."

195
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,360
Good luck to you.

196
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,480
Mr. Matthews,what is this about?

197
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,280
I don't think I can be objective with you as a student

198
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,080
given our history.

199
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,320
Our history?

200
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,560
Yeah, as in you calling me "a child molesting pervert"

201
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,320
on your blog and almost costing me my job.

202
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,160
Oh, right.

203
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,760
Um, my bad.

204
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,880
I think it's best if I'm not your teacher--

205
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,480
for both of us.

206
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,680
Quiet please.

207
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,120
Look, Mr. Matthews...

208
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,760
I was actually looking forward to this class--

209
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,680
to your class.

210
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,600
It might sound corny,

211
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,120
but you're not like the other teachers.

212
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,240
Maybe that was my problem.

213
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,600
I understand the sub had you reading Heart of Darkness.

214
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,280
Did he assign a paper

215
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah, a three-page study on the character of our choice.

216
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,640
Lame.

217
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,640
Sounds fine to me. Please double-space it,

218
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,520
and make sure to use standard margins.

219
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,000
Ms. Silver, you can go.

220
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,120
So thanks for coming in.

221
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,360
Oh, thank you.

222
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,800
My teeth feel cleaner already.

223
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,560
Bye.

224
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,520
What are you guys doing here?

225
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,280
We need to talk.





230
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,200
I don't have time for this.

231
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,120
I have to meet my agent in three minutes.

232
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,960
Okay, well, then give us three minutes.

233
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,800
This is important.

234
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,320
You called in the guidance counselor?

235
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,040
The frikin' guidance counselor?

236
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,880
I had to, Ade. You're pregnant.

237
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,680
You think I don't know that?

238
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,680
You don't seem like you know it.

239
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,560
You certainly don't act like it.

240
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,320
Well, why don't I go get some pickles and ice cream.

241
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,920
Would that make you happy?

242
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,480
Naomi just thought that

243
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,760
I would be a good resource for you,

244
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
and she was right.

245
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,480
You need to see a doctor.

246
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,000
You have to start taking care of yourself.

247
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,400
The coffee,

248
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,320
The staying up late, it's all got to go.

249
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,160
As a pregnant teenager, you're in a high-risk group

250
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,120
For all kinds of problems.

251
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,279
If you don't get proper care, you could lose this baby.

252
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,160
Right, but you also

253
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,640
Have to consider your options, okay? She's 16.

254
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,640
Teenagers do this a lot with the right support...

255
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,720
Support, right, okay.

256
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,480
Ms. Taylor, Ade doesn't have the support.

257
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,480
Her dad is gone and her mother is a nightmare.

258
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,880
Naomi, shut up.

259
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,680
Ade, you deserve to have a future.

260
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,640
You deserve to get to to go college

261
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,480
And have a career,and have a real family someday.

262
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,880
I'm saying you should have an abortion.

263
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,840
I'm done.

264
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,080
Of course, you should consider all of your options.

265
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,280
But in my experience,teens so often rush to abortion

266
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,040
Like it's the only option.

267
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,359
But she could have this child if she wants to.

268
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,840
I mean, if you're not ready to be a mother,

269
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,480
Then there's always adoption.

270
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,420
So many people desperately want to have kids that can't.

271
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,360
Am I to understand that you're encouraging her

272
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,160
To continue with this pregnancy?

273
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,920
Do you really think--no offense, Ade--

274
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,840
Do you really think she's responsible enough?

275
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,840
- Look how she's handled it so...  - You know what?

276
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,440
Next time you guys decide to intrude in someone's life,

277
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,120
Get your agendas straight first.

278
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,200
Okay, this is your choice, not ours.

279
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,640
But you have to take control of this of your life

280
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,440
Before it takes control of you.

281
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,600
"Miss Silver"?

282
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,760
Who calls me Miss Silver?

283
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,760
Unbelievable, right?

284
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,440
Well, um, it sounds to me...

285
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,360
I mean, anyone else, anyone else

286
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,120
Kicks me out of their class and... I'm proud of it.

287
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,960
But Mr.Matthews is...

288
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,360
He's, like, the one teacher in this whole school

289
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,240
Who isn't some brain-dead zombie jerk.

290
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,120
How could he do this to me?

291
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,400
Okay. Um...

292
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,200
Well, you did kind of harsh on him on "The Vicious Circle."

293
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,879
"Professor Pervert"?

294
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,040
"Matthews wades in the Kiddie Pool"?

295
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,560
"Dips Into the Kiddie Pool."

296
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,480
And as far as I knew, he did.

297
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,760
I didn't do anything wrong.

298
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
Still, he has feelings.

299
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,640
Yeah, okay. So what?

300
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,320
So...

301
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,560
Mr. Matthews probably

302
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,560
Didn't want to be hurt by what you said, but he was.

303
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,240
You know, guys like to play like they're hard,

304
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,800
You know, like they don't have any feelings,

305
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,960
Or like they don't get hurt by what you say,

306
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,440
But they do get hurt.

307
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,800
Even when they say something's cool...

308
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,880
Maybe it's not.

309
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,119
Yeah.

310
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,280
And... you're intense.

311
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,740
Some things you say have the power

312
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:46,741
To hurt people, you know?

313
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,920
Yeah. I think I do.

314
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
Yeah?

315
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,200
You know what I'm gonna do?

316
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,480
- You don't have to do anything.  - I do.

317
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,960
And I'm going to.

318
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,280
I'm gonna win Mr. Matthews back.

319
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,800
I'm gonna write the best paper

320
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,040
On Heart of Darkness that has ever been written

321
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,280
In the history of English papers ever.

322
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,200
So...

323
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,840
You're gonna do the assignment

324
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,160
Even though you're not in the class?

325
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,160
Prepare to have your mind blown, Mr. Matthews.

326
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,400
Artisan moldings-- ka-ching!

327
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,800
Who the hell are you?

328
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,360
Oh. Hi.

329
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,000
Lucinda Tunick.

330
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,520
Tunick Realty.

331
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,920
I'm doing the walk-through for the broker pre-tour.

332
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,680
I don't understand a single word you just said, so...

333
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,000
Naomi.

334
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,560
Dad, what are you doing here?

335
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,200
Tracy hasn't talked to you?

336
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,160
Great. Just great.

337
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,680
Lucinda, can you give us a minute, please?

338
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,240
Well, nice to see you, too.

339
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,920
What's going on?

340
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,520
Your mother...

341
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,320
Is in Paris, she's getting back in about...

342
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,800
No, that's just it-- she's not.

343
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,199
She's... not in Paris,

344
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,280
- Or she's not coming back? What?  - Kiddo,

345
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,000
Your mother's going through kind of a tough time.

346
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,840
She thought she found her birth son.

347
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,200
He turned out to be a con man-- what a shock.

348
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,840
She says she's getting migraines again,

349
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,800
She wants a little R&R,

350
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,400
So she's laying low in New York.

351
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,720
What? For how long?

352
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,240
I don't know,all bets are off.

353
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,520
And I'm not willing to hold off

354
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,200
Selling this house until she gets back,

355
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,360
So it's going on the market.

356
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,440
Selling the house? I live here!

357
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,120
Not anymore.

358
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,960
You can come and live at the beach with Gail and me.

359
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,440
Oh, wow, that sounds exciting.

360
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,920
Go pack your things.

361
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,840
Make sure your room's clean for the open house.












373
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,360
It's all right.

374
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,220
Dad, I have to go back to the house

375
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,220
To get my favorite jeans-- I left them.

376
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,820
I suppose it would kill you to wear one of the other

377
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,740
43 pairs of jeans that I bought you.

378
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,540
Oh, Naomi, I wanted to, uh,

379
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,700
Talk to you about something.

380
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,340
Right. You're glad I'm here,

381
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,060
You're not trying to replace my mom,

382
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,620
And you want us to be pals, squawk, squawk, squawk.

383
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,860
Actually, no.

384
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,700
Last night I got woken up at 3:00 a.m.

385
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,980
By, well, it sounded like a blow-dryer.

386
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,460
Right, I take showers before bed.

387
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,820
If I sleep on wet hair,

388
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,220
It's a crap-fiesta in the morning.

389
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,540
You know what?

390
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,860
I'm good on breakfast.

391
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,740
- I'm gonna get my jeans.  - Sit.

392
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,660
Naomi, you're in my house now,you'll do as I say.

393
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,260
Do you understand?

394
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,660
Of course.

395
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,260
How about a pancake, Naomi?

396
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,060
That sounds fantastic, Gail!


398
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,700
Boy, you look exhausted-- were you up all night?

399
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,060
Genius doesn't sleep.

400
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,579
Well... genius may have dozed off for an hour or two

401
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,700
And drooled on her keyboard.

402
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,140
Well, I'm glad to see you excited about schoolwork.

403
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,460
- Heart of Darkness, right?  - Yeah.

404
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,420
But, uh, when I'm done with this,

405
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,820
They're gonna have to rename it Heart of Silver.

406
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,100
Silver of Darkness.

407
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,460
Matthews is gonna

408
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,060
Send me a handwritten invitation

409
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,580
Pleading with me to come back to his class.

410
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,700
- Come back?  - Yeah.

411
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,060
Didn't you hear?

412
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,220
He transferred me out.

413
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,380
Did he say why?

414
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,860
Mm, you know Matthews.

415
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,340
He's a little bit sensitive.

416
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,340
And this bad boy is ready to print.

417
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,500
"Alack, our terrene moon is now eclipsed.

418
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,500
And it portends now the fall of Antony."

419
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,620
"I must stay his time."

420
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,140
To flatter Caesar,

421
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,260
Would you mingle eyes with one who ties his points?

422
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,460
Ty.

423
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,420
Hi, guys.

424
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,260
Sounds great.I like the way you enunciate, Ethan.

425
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,020
Oh, why, thank you, Ty.

426
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,020
I like the way you wear your jeans just one size too small.

427
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,500
Now, how many guys could pull that off?

428
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,539
Hey, Annie, I noticed we're scheduled to audition

429
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,300
With each other this afternoon.

430
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,060
Want to get together and...rehearse beforehand?

431
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,140
Unless you mind.

432
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,220
Oh, of course not.

433
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,220
Please, be my guest.

434
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,020
Cool. I'm telling you,a little rehearsal,

435
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,980
And these parts are ours.

436
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,220
It'll be good being in a play with you again.

437
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,060
I miss acting with you.

438
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,380
Besides, we can hang out

439
00:18:05,381 --> 00:18:06,881
And do the whole backstage thing.

440
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,020
Yeah.

441
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,900
Sure.

442
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,500
You sure you don't mind?

443
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,980
What, you think I'm jealous of that pretty boy?

444
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,380
Please.

445
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,220
- You want to do this again?  - Sure.

446
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,260
Uh, from the top?

447
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,140
Sure.

448
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,140
OK

449
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,380
To flatter Caesar,

450
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,220
Would you mingle eyes with one who ties his points?

451
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,940
Not know me yet?

452
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,780
Cold-hearted toward me?

453
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,900
Nice work.

454
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,420
Both of you.

455
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,100
Uh, cast list will be up first thing in the morning.

456
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,779
Hey, that felt good, right?

457
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,500
'Cause it felt good to me, and she was smiling.

458
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,540
I mean, it looked like she was smiling.

459
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,740
She was like a Cheshire cat.

460
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,660
Um, listen, Ty,

461
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,440
uh, I am with Ethan now,

462
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,940
And I have to be clear about that.

463
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,540
I know you're with Ethan,

464
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,420
And I'm cool with it.

465
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,020
I mean, I can't pretend

466
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,420
I'm not surprised.

467
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,299
I just didn't figure you'd end up with a jock.

468
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,380
But...

469
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,060
I'm cool with it.

470
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,500
Well, I'm glad.

471
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,540
- I'm glad we're cool.  - Absolutely.

472
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,300
And we'll keep everything strictly professional.

473
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,740
Okay, Cleopatra?

474
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,220
You got it, Antony.

475
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,620
We're gonna make West Beverly theater history.

476
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,140
We'll be fantastic once you really get a chance to

477
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,780
You know, get comfortable with your part.

478
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,700
I... What-what does that mean?

479
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,420
Well... I mean,

480
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,060
Up there you weren't always giving me lots of emotion,

481
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,540
Which... made it hard for me to find some of my beats.

482
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,540
Don't worry,you're gonna get there.

483
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,140
Just try to remember your blocking cues,

484
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,900
'Cause a couple of times you stepped right in front of me.

485
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,740
Hey, I got to go.

486
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,100
Don't worry.

487
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,340
We'll keep it professional.

488
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,979
Oh, yes.

489
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,140
No worries.

490
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,980
What is your problem?

491
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,500
Taking out a personal grudge on a student?

492
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,540
You're off base.

493
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,860
Look, us getting together

494
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,820
didn't work out for either of us, okay?

495
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,580
But don't punish my sister.

496
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,860
You know what?

497
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,179
West Beverly High doesn't revolve

498
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,020
around Kelly Taylor's love life.

499
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,180
You know, Ryan, if anybody should be pissed here, it's me.

500
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,059
- Brenda? Really?  - You know what, Kelly?

501
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,420
My decision to transfer Silver out

502
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,340
had nothing to do with you, okay, or us.

503
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,860
Then what?

504
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,500
I had a lot of time to think

505
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,820
in South Dakota,all right?

506
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,140
And you know what I realized?

507
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,460
I'm burned out.

508
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,180
You're burned out? You're 23.

509
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,580
You know, I used to come to work here every day

510
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,420
and pour my heart and soul into what I did, you know?

511
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,980
I... I went out on a limb.

512
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,420
And the limb broke.

513
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,219
Okay, everybody thought the worst of me.

514
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,980
the students, the teachers.

515
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,140
I mean, the students that I thought actually knew me.

516
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:39,500
Silver? e... Did you see what she wrote?

517
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,380
She got carried away. She's a kid.

518
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,500
They're all kids, Ryan.

519
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,740
Yeah, maybe so,

520
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,820
but it happened, and, uh...

521
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,180
I can't be the kind of teacher I was before.

522
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,580
So I'm punching the clock till the end of the year,

523
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,939
and then that's it for me.

524
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,580
And then what?

525
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,700
I don't know.

526
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,420
I guess we'll see.

527
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,420
But with Silver, it's just, it's better this way.

528
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,700
for both of us, all right?

529
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,940
In fact, give this back to her.

530
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,259
This is not the Ryan Matthews I know.

531
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,139
Yeah, well, maybe you don't know me.

532
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,380
Maybe I don't want to.

533
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,860
But I do know one thing:

534
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,819
You're a teacher, a good one.

535
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,340
And when a kid busts her ass to write a paper for a class

536
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,540
she's not even in, what kind of teacher doesn't read it?

537
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,180
Ms. Casey?

538
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,740
Hi, I'm Adrianna Tate-Duncan.

539
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,060
Oh.

540
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,060
I'm a little late, I know.

541
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,380
A little?

542
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,180
I am so-so-so-so sorry

543
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,900
I had a doctor's appointment.

544
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,220
Your scene partner came and went. It's done, so...

545
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:53,140
Okay, listen, I... I know the whole play.

546
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,620
Every word. Can...

547
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,539
Can-can I do the suicide scene for you at least, please?

548
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,900
Please?

549
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,420
This is not how we do it in New York, honey.

550
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,900
Sorry.

551
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,420
Give me my robe.

552
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,980
Put on my crown.

553
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:29,460
I have immortal longings in me.

554
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,420
Now no more

555
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:38,620
the juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip.

556
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I trust you won't tell Gail about this

557
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I trust you won't tell the other brokers

558
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,219
Oh, hey, nix-nix.

559
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,540
Pasta?

560
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,460
And steamed artichokes.

561
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,460
Hey, I thought you might want to ask Silver to join us.

562
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,420
Didn't you tell me she's an artichoke fiend?

563
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,820
Um, the girl likes artichokes.

564
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,339
Well, it'd be nice

565
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,540
to have her over for dinner at some point.

566
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,020
Or not.

567
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,740
Sit.

568
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,340
Talk to your mother.

569
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,059
What about?

570
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,260
Well, what's going on with you and Silver?

571
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,540
Are you guys having problems?

572
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,499
Not according to her.

573
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,300
Well, what about according to you?

574
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:05,860
Well, you know, we kind of got into a fight.

575
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,540
Well...

576
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,460
first I told her I loved her.

577
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,980
You did?

578
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:19,059
But we-we got into a fight after, you know?

579
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,660
She just blew up on me.

580
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,460
Like, I don't even get it.

581
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,060
Well, did you talk about it?

582
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,820
Does she know you're upset?

583
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,380
We kind of decided not to talk about it, you know?

584
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,379
Just sweep it under a rug.

585
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,380
How's that going?

586
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,579
Just feels like there's something big under the rug.

587
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,380
Somebody's gonna break their neck.

588
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:41,659
Mm. You up for some maternal wisdom?

589
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,060
Willing to take a risk.

590
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,780
I like flowers, right?

591
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,539
I mean, big shockeroo, a girl likes flowers.

592
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,140
But your dad never

593
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,060
ever brought me flowers.

594
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,980
I would hint, I would sulk,I would open magazines

595
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,340
to photos of flowers, and he would never ever get the clues.

596
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,939
Birthdays, Valentine's Day, no flowers.

597
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,180
Finally, I came up

598
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,180
with something very crafty, very clever.

599
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,860
What's that?

600
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:16,180
I said "I want flowers."

601
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,660
Oh...

602
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,259
People aren't mind readers.

603
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,859
Even people who are really close.

604
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,260
If you're upset with Silver,

605
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,699
you can't just expect her to just know that.

606
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,260
You have to tell her and be direct.

607
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,940
Hi.

608
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,620
Hey, Miss No Cell Phone Service.

609
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,660
Feel like I should have sent a pigeon carrier

610
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,660
or smoke signals.

611
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,459
I'm sorry.

612
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,460
I just had to drive.

613
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,060
Where to

614
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,339
Nowhere.

615
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:05,060
I just drove and drove and drove,

616
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,979
trying to figure out what I should do.

617
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,980
And?

618
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,300
And I was driving up the coast

619
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,539
and I kept seeing these people on the beach.

620
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:24,260
They were playing volleyball and flying kites...

621
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,500
without a care in the world.

622
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,820
And I kept thinking...

623
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,899
"Adrianna, you're never gonna be like them again."

624
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,100
I have a kid

625
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:43,500
or I have an abortion.

626
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:47,180
Either way...

627
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:50,820
how am I ever gonna fly a kite again?

628
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,660
You know what I mean?

629
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,820
I mean, it's not like we fly kites, but...

630
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,340
Flying kites is always an option.

631
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,979
Anyway, I was driving

632
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,220
and driving, and then somewhere around Big Sur,

633
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,060
I almost got killed.

634
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,220
What? What happened?

635
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,340
A car accident or this almost accident.

636
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,540
My God, are you okay?

637
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:20,499
I pulled over, and suddenly it hit me, you know?

638
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,339
Like, I... I have to take control of the situation.

639
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,580
I have to make a choice.

640
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,700
And I ended up going

641
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,219
to this woman's clinic

642
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,180
that my hairdresser was talking about.

643
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,860
I saw a doctor, and...

644
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,900
Did, did you...?

645
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,420
I couldn't. I can't.

646
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,100
Honey, I understand.

647
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,020
Honestly, I don't think I could either.

648
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,940
I mean, it's one thing to talk about it, but...

649
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,139
I can't.

650
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,299
I'm too far along.

651
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:56,020
It's not legal, it's not possible.

652
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,580
Abortion just isn't an option.

653
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:05,340
Whether I like it or not, I'm having this baby.

654
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,210
Hey, Dad, can you move your car?

655
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,250
You blocked me in again.

656
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:31,090
Okay, but park in the street when you get back, will ya?

657
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:33,290
I'm tired of moving my car every half an hour.

658
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:37,050
Um, yeah, actually, I'm not coming back.

659
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,610
I reserved a hotel suite.

660
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,489
I'm gonna stay there until Mom comes home.

661
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,489
No.

662
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,890
- Yes. - Naomi,

663
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,610
I am your father. There is no option.

664
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,610
Yeah

665
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,370
technically you're my father,

666
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,729
but you haven't been much of a parent, have you?

667
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,849
You haven't earned the right to parent me.

668
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,930
I mean, there's teenagers straight out of rehab

669
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,450
who can't even afford a cup of coffee

670
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,969
who'll make better parents than you.

671
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,610
You can't talk to me like that.

672
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:03,129
I went by the house yesterday to pick up my jeans

673
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:06,329
around 3:00 p.m.

674
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,130
You know, I don't see how

675
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,810
that lovely broker of ours is ever gonna sell that house

676
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:14,810
if you keep her tied up with all your pointless busy work.

677
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,410
I'm your father.

678
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:20,050
I don't need a father anymore.

679
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:21,730
But thanks.

680
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,770
Oh, but I do need you to move your car.

681
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,249
You wanted to see me?

682
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,290
Read your paper.

683
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,290
Oh, yeah?

684
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,690
Yep.

685
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,889
And?

686
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,529
I mean, uh...

687
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,810
Did you like it?

688
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,570
It's not bad.

689
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,569
It was insightful.

690
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,569
It's ambitious.

691
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,250
I liked knowing

692
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:59,090
that you read the book.

693
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,809
I liked knowing that it meant something to you,

694
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,970
and I liked reading what you thought.

695
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,330
Thanks.

696
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:09,370
Well...

697
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,889
Thank you...

698
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,889
for...

699
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:14,850
making me want to stay up all night

700
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:15,890
getting carpal tunnel.

701
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,290
Glad you liked the book.

702
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,210
Yeah. It was pretty kick-ass.

703
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,890
You know, you might cut down

704
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,450
on some of the enthusiastic colloquial adjectives

705
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:31,049
that you seem to be so fond of-- "kick-ass", "bad-ass"...

706
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,530
anything with an "ass" in it, really.

707
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,289
Just, you might try finding

708
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,810
a synonym next time.

709
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,409
Next time?

710
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,250
Yeah.

711
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:42,810
So... I'm back in your class?

712
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,490
Cool.

713
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,890
I'll get a thesaurus.

714
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:56,730
Thanks to everyone who auditioned,

715
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:59,010
and kids, no crying. Please.

716
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,050
At least until I'm out of hearing range.

717
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,170
Huh. Charmian?

718
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,690
It's a pretty good part.

719
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,110
You're Cleopatra's favorite servant girl,

720
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,530
and you get to die at the end.

721
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,730
Wonderful. Just wonderful.

722
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,530
Congrats! You got a part, dude.

723
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,450
I did? No way.

724
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,970
Move.

725
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:23,930
Mardian the Eunuch?

726
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,010
All right.

727
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,170
You auditioned?

728
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,010
Well, I mean, I figured...

729
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:29,870
A little bit of public sweating

730
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:30,690
Probably wouldn't hurt me.

731
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,170
Plus, I mean, we get to hang out.

732
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,930
We can do the whole... backstage thing.

733
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,400
Yeah, yeah.

734
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,930
Are you okay?

735
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,290
Yeah.

736
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,800
Who got Cleopatra?

737
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,290
Who else?

738
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,770
Adrianna.

739
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,770
Whatever you need, whenever you need it,

740
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:48,090
I'm here. You can call, text,

741
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,410
knock on my door at 3:00 in the morning.

742
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,900
Thank you.

743
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,800
I'm, I'm sorry if I was rude before.

744
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:57,050
I just...

745
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,930
Can I blame it on hormones?

746
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,450
I am a high school guidance counselor.

747
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,730
I'm used to abuse.

748
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,050
So, first step,

749
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,929
She's going to need some medical info.

750
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,650
Um... I guess you could be helpful in getting her

751
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:07,730
into some kind of support group,

752
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,730
Maybe for teenage moms.

753
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,570
Obviously we have to find a good doctor.

754
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,410
I want her to have the best OB/GYN in town.

755
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,490
That's nice.

756
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,810
Only the best for you, baby.

757
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,570
Platinum speculum all the way.

758
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,890
I'll make some calls.

759
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,690
Adrianna,

760
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,970
The doctor is gonna want to know

761
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,250
Who the father is--

762
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:26,170
You know, for hereditary health reasons.

763
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,809
Okay.

764
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,090
Sure.

765
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:33,250
So, you conceived before you went into rehab,

766
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,610
Right?

767
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,210
Hank isn't the father.

768
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,050
Wait. What?

769
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,410
Then who?

770
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:46,890
There's only one guy it could be.

771
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,490
Guess who?

772
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,600
Ty. Hi.

773
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,440
Antony to your Cleopatra.

774
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,730
Congrats.

775
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,650
See you at the dinner.

776
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,790
Uh... hon, there's a light right there.

777
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,470
I know.

778
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,390
Annie?

779
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,950
Hey. The door was open.

780
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:44,000
That's a casual look.

781
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,830
Uh... You know,

782
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,050
I'm really not up

783
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:50,270
For the cast and crew dinner thing.

784
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,310
Oh. I thought the whole point of me doing this play

785
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:53,550
Was so we could hang out together.

786
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,860
I'm sorry.

787
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,110
Come on. It's gonna be fun.

788
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,670
An Egyptian restaurant.

789
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,430
I don't even really know what Egyptian cuisine entails.

790
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,590
Couscous.

791
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,420
I'm guessing couscous.

792
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,150
You go ahead.

793
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,710
You don't mind?

794
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,710
Seriously, go. Have fun.

795
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,190
You know you're my leading lady, right?





800
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,670
Well, well, well,the notorious

801
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,910
Brian Matthews.

802
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,710
I see my reputation precedes me.

803
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,270
Welcome to West Beverly.

804
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,470
Thank you.

805
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,990
Damon, Congrats on Enobarbus.

806
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,460
So, wh-what brings you here?

807
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,470
Ah, free food.

808
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,750
You know what teachers make.

809
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:53,830
Can't really afford groceries.

810
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,390
Thanks for that.

811
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,460
Plus, I actually wanted to talk to you. I, uh...

812
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,970
I'm thinking of putting Antony and Cleopatra

813
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,470
On my syllabus

814
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,860
And I thought, you know, maybe you could come to class

815
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:05,950
And talk to the kids from a director's point of view.

816
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,950
Interdisciplinary. I like it.

817
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,990
Sounds like you're a very passionate teacher.

818
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,470
What can I say?

819
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,580
You know, you can't reach these kids

820
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,770
Unless you're willing to go out

821
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,950
On a limb once in a while.

822
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,470
Oh. A fellow tree-climber, are you?

823
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,870
I'm gonna get some schwarma.

824
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,510
- But I'll, I'll see ya. - Yeah.

825
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,390
Nice to meet you.

826
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,950
Dixon! You're late! What happened?

827
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,630
- Uh, Silver. I...  - Doesn't matter.

828
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,620
Did you hear?

829
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,540
Ryan let me back into his class.

830
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,470
Yes, my amazing-paper plan worked.

831
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,110
I mean, that's great, but...

832
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,670
And he loved it.

833
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,750
He wouldn't stop going on about

834
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,830
How great the paper was.

835
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,710
Cool. I...I think the word

836
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,230
"insightful" actually came up once or twice. Insightful.

837
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,149
Insightful.

838
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,910
And then he actually started telling me...

839
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:02,069
You know, for someone so insightful,

840
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,750
You could be pretty dense.

841
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,830
Sorry, what?

842
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,110
All right.

843
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,510
Look.

844
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,550
I know you're not a mind reader.

845
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,630
Ooh. You're on to me.

846
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,500
Can I please just talk

847
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:21,310
For one second without being interrupted?

848
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:24,180
Okay.

849
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,709
All right.

850
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,500
The fight that we had at the beach.

851
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,029
It freaked me out.

852
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,420
You know...

853
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,340
I know you're intense.

854
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,830
And I, I get that.

855
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,670
You have big moods and a lot of them.

856
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,670
You know?

857
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,750
I get that.

858
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,270
You're stormy.

859
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,590
So?

860
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:56,310
So I want to break up with you.

861
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,190
What?

862
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:05,030
I'm breaking up.

863
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,550
It's over.

864
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,300
Thank you.

865
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,110
Thank you so much for coming with me.

866
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:24,510
No problem.

867
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:27,590
I like theater people, you know?

868
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,470
Well, in small doses, that is.

869
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,470
The second some actor dude

870
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,100
Comes up to me, and corners me

871
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,470
And starts talking about his "process,"

872
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,750
I might have to duck back to my hotel.

873
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,270
Listen to you.

874
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,390
"Duck back to my hotel."

875
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,060
I love saying it.

876
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,990
It's the most beautiful phrase in the English language.

877
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,150
"Duck back to my hotel."

878
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,110
But seriously,

879
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,350
If you ever need to crash...

880
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,180
What's wrong?

881
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,670
Ty just walked in.

882
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:09,110
Are you gonna talk to him?

883
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,030
Eventually.

884
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,270
Hey, honey.

885
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,270
Hey.

886
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,790
Whatcha doing?

887
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,549
Just, uh, sitting here, feeling like an idiot.

888
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,549
Well,

889
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,710
Can we join you?

890
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,350
I mean, for the sitting part.

891
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,510
I really thought I was gonna get the part.

892
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:41,150
Annie, you got a part.

893
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,510
You have a reason to celebrate tonight.

894
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,630
You know,

895
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,670
Once in college,

896
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,150
I applied for a summer photo

897
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,510
Internship at Vogue.

898
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,310
I wanted it so much, but...

899
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:54,350
But you didn't get it, and you ended up

900
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,540
Working at the local newspaper,which turned out to be

901
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,190
The best thing that could have happened.

902
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,590
Have I told you that one before?

903
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:01,710
It's an oldie...

904
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,150
But a goodie.

905
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,590
You know, sweetie, the bottom line is

906
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,670
You got beat.

907
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,990
No shame, and that happens

908
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,230
To even the best teams.

909
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:10,150
Besides, Adrianna's lived here her whole life,

910
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,470
She's got the home court advantage.

911
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,470
Yeah.

912
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,310
Well... thanks, you guys,

913
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:16,990
But I don't know.

914
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:20,780
I feel bummed out that I didn't get the lead,

915
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,070
And then I feel bummed out that I'm the kind of person

916
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,900
That gets bummed out that they didn't get the lead,

917
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:29,190
And then imagining being at that party tonight

918
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,790
And having to pretend like I'm not bummed out...

919
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,270
You get bummed out.

920
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,860
Yeah. Especially if I'm worrying

921
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,030
About not being a good enough actress

922
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,670
To hide that I'm bummed out.

923
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,870
No. You are an amazing actress,

924
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,390
And they will all think you're thrilled to be there.

925
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,510
I agree. In fact, I think they'll think

926
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,230
You didn't want to be Cleopatra to begin with.

927
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,830
Think of it as a challenge.

928
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:54,150
Ugh. Why is life so full of challenges?

929
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,550
Because it's life.

930
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:58,550
True.

931
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,270
Very true.



934
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,220
Eth?

935
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,550
I changed my mind.

936
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,830
I'm coming.

937
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,190
Cool.

938
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,710
