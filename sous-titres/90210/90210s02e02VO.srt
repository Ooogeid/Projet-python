Previously on: 90210

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,820
That's tennis guy.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,780
Is he hot,or is he hot?

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,820
- Ade?
- Teddy!

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,150
Ade had sex with that guy?

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,050
He was her first.

7
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,800
- You and me we're done.
- What?

8
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,150
Naomi is your sister?

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,000
She's gonna ha you.

10
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,170
No,she'll never know it's me.

11
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,000
All I can think of is liam.

12
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,080
Naomi?

13
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:19,920
Got to talk to you.

14
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,190
You decided to call
the cops on the party.

15
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,450
Your friends are mad at you.

16
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,370
Deal with it.

17
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,140
I spent the whole summer in
summer school because of you,

18
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,560
and you never apologized once?

19
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,220
You know what?Screw you,dixon!

20
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,060
Screw you,too,annie.

21
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,100
I really don't feel like talking,okay?

22
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,140
How about drinking?

23
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,930
Oh,my god.

24
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,460
Is that naked girl annie?

25
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,590
Thank you very much.

26
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,310
what can I say?

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,520
You just caught my eye,danny.

28
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,920
donny.

29
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,570
donny.Right.

30
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,980
I just didn't realize the
tech club had such cuties.

31
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,150
Well,thank you.

32
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,300
So random question.

33
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,350
Um,my friend and i have this bet going.

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,750
She says I can't send
out a text anonymously.

35
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,590
And I was,like,"you totally can.

36
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,620
" You totally can,right?

37
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,650
Did konrad zuse invent the first
binary programmable computer?

38
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,930
Well,the answer's yeah.

39
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,070
Perfect.That's great.

40
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,250
So,would you mind just showing me so
I can settle this bet once and for all?

41
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:26,930
There you are!

42
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,520
Hey,what you doing?

43
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,560
Oh.

44
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,050
The geeks are trying to
recruit me for the tech club.

45
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,290
dirtbag,two o'clock.Don't look.

46
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,850
that's subtle,you guys.Nice.

47
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,800
He better not try to talk to me again.

48
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,880
Hey,don't worry.

49
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,660
He won't get by us.

50
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,210
Right,silver?

51
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,360
Silver?Hello.

52
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,610
I have to try to talk to him again.

53
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,640
Me and dixon-- we have
something really special.

54
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,760
And just because I made a mistake,it
doesn't mean that it's over.

55
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,900
I just have to apologize.

56
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,750
But you did,right?

57
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,390
Last night.

58
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,430
Last night he was furious.

59
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,720
You know what?Give it a week.

60
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,330
- Why?
- Why?

61
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,960
Because it's only been 24 hours.

62
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,790
If he was mad last night,you're
not gonna get through to him now.

63
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,640
If you wait a week,he'll
have cooled down,

64
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,060
and he'll be a lot more
receptive to your explanation.

65
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,860
Come on.

66
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,250
I guess it can't hurt.

67
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,030
Still have a few spots
left on the blaze!

68
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,560
Don't miss out on your
opportunity to participate

69
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,110
in west bev's only serious
journalistic enterprise.

70
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,610
And when I say serious,I mean fun.

71
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,740
- Hey.
- What's up,boy?

72
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,220
Silver still staring at me?

73
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,690
Yeah.Affirmative.

74
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,480
Yeah.

75
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,880
Ade says she's,uh,still
pretty broken up about it.

76
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,820
Whatever,man.She's been
lying to me all summer.

77
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,170
And besides,now that it's over...

78
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,530
I kind of feel relieved.

79
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,670
You know,I'm free.

80
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,940
New year,new dixon.

81
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,780
Douche bag alert.

82
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,300
Dude,seriously,what's your problem?

83
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,630
Just look at him.

84
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,500
He's been here for exactly three
hours,and he's already mr.Popularity.

85
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,290
why is it so funny?

86
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,090
I can't believe ade lost
her virginity to that guy.

87
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,470
Look,who cares?

88
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,870
I mean,it's not like
she's into him or anything.

89
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,630
Of course she's not into him.

90
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,620
Why would you even say that?

91
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,310
- Okay.
- Join the blaze!

92
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,700
We may not be popular,we may not
be popular,but we've got heart!

93
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,490
Well,lookie here.It's the skank.

94
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,250
you have no idea how hellish
I'm about to make your life.

95
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,040
Naomi,wait.

96
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,030
- I gotta talk to you.
- Don'T.Don'T.

97
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,140
Three months,not a
word,and now you gotta talk.

98
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,670
I don't gotta talk now.

99
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,250
Look,my stepdad sent me
away that night to this...

100
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,160
this wilderness thing.

101
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,940
I had no phones,no computers...

102
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,420
poor you.

103
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,540
That's not what I mean.I just...

104
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,590
I'm really sorry.

105
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,440
you're sorry?

106
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,200
You had sex with annie,and you're sorry.

107
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,510
Annie?

108
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,320
Oh,great.Okay,now
you're going to deny it.

109
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,140
You know what?I walked in
on you half-naked,liam...

110
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,910
no,no,no.I...

111
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,670
I had sex with someone,yeah,but...

112
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,100
it wasn't annie.

113
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,590
Then who was it?

114
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,190
well...

115
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,470
right.Okay.

116
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,500
Um,your time's up.

117
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,180
What did that loser want?

118
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,310
Who cares?

119
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,280
Let's just get out of here.

123
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,730
I'll never figure out
this coffee machine.

124
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,090
My old one cost 20 bucks,but at
least I could make a cup of coffee.

125
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,170
- Hi,ma.
- Liam.Hi.

126
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,220
Good.You're home.

127
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,370
Hello,liam.

128
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,120
This is jen clark.

129
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:54,640
She came over to talk
about her sister,naomi.

130
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,880
Apparently,you caused naomi
a lot of pain last year,

131
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,600
so we both think it's
best that you stay away.

132
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,980
She's finally begun to heal.

133
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,200
You know?

134
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,610
- You're psychotic.
- Liam,that's enough!

135
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,030
I'm so sorry.He'S...

136
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,960
no.No.It's okay.

137
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,790
This is all very emotional.

138
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,170
I completely understand.It's okay.

139
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,960
Well,you have my word.

140
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,760
He will stay away from naomi.

141
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,950
That's all I care about.

142
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,040
I mean...

143
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:19,920
listen,I...

144
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,130
I'm gonna skip the cup of
coffee,sweetie,but,colleen,thank you so much.

145
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,750
I feel better already.Really.

146
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,960
Bye,liam.

147
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,660
And I really miss you.

148
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,620
I've been...I've been
thinking about you nonstop.

149
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,500
Uncle don,and,you
know,it's just been so long,

150
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,850
and I cannot wait for thanksgiving.

151
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,270
Okay,bye.

152
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,910
Hey!

153
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,390
That was uncle don.

154
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,650
He's a great guy.

155
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,150
It's just been so long.

156
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,290
You know.

157
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,620
And I thought you might
actually be calling dixon.

158
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,170
- Dixon?
- Yeah.

159
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,090
No.That was...

160
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,040
that was not dixon.

161
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,220
Okay,it was dixon,and now
I have to call him back

162
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,560
because I just left him the
weirdest message in the wor...

163
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,560
what happened to waiting a week?

164
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,150
Sorry we're late.

165
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,880
All right,let's get started.

166
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,740
Welcome,everyone,to the first
meeting of blaze news uh,

167
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,810
let me just say that I am so pumped,

168
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,520
so pumped to see you all here.

169
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,770
Um,we have six people signed
up at the activity fair,

170
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,910
so now we're up to 12 people,so we're
moving in the right direction,right?

171
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,380
yeah,so,now it's definitely
gonna be an uphill climb.

172
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,790
Um,last year,the staff drove
blaze news into the ground.

173
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,980
They didn't really produce news stories.

174
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,330
They just,you kw,came
up here to smoke weed.

175
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,070
Uh,but trust me,it's gonna
be different this year.

176
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,840
And,uh,we're gonna have a
lot of stuff on the tab...

177
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,210
- Yo!
- Yeah?

178
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,100
- Can we stiok sme weed here?
- No.No weed.

179
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,650
So here's what I'm planning.

180
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,570
Uh,a once-a-week,hard-hitting
news magazine,um,peppered...

181
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:11,130
peppered
with,uh,personal,uh,interest stories.

182
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,380
Um,and I-I think we can all,you know,

183
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,280
contribute a little something to.

184
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,640
Uh,I just made a reservation
for sushi,but wow.

185
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,550
Oh,no.

186
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,430
What a debacle.

187
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,570
Um,you're going to hate me.

188
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,890
Oh,well,come-come here.

189
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,080
Hey,hey.

190
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,060
Oh,hello.

191
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,560
I must have double-booked tonight.

192
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,450
An old friend is taking
me to this benefit.

193
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,470
I...

194
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
I feel sick about it.

195
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,950
You hate me,right?

196
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,000
Uh,a little bit.

197
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,930
No,I don't hate you.

198
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,790
Um,it happens.

199
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,450
Yeah,I should probably
get going anyways.

200
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,130
I think I,uh,stood up
two swimsuit models.

201
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,310
You're so sweet,which only makes me
feel worse about this whole situation.

202
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,650
Can you just at least come in for
a bit until I absolutely have to go?

203
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,350
Sure.

204
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,410
- Of course.
- Fabulous.

205
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,100
Oh,and we have to reschedule...

206
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,190
- yeah.
- Immediately.

207
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,040
Well,I'll have to see if I
can,uh,move some things around.

208
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,220
Oh,here.

209
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,480
- Could you help?
- Sure.

210
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,330
Thank you.

211
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,960
You know,between you and
me,pearls remind me of old ladies.

212
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,590
I feel like I should be storing
tissue in my bosom or something.

213
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,780
Um,you could always not wear them.

214
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,650
I wish.

215
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,770
But gregory bought them for me.

216
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,800
He's the friend I'm seeing tonight.

217
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,810
So,anyway.

218
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,270
- Here.
- Uh,sure.

219
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,700
- So,welcome back.
- Thank you.

220
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,610
Tell me.Did you absolutely love vietnam?

221
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,250
I went bananas my first time there.

222
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,080
Yeah,well,I'm guessing your vietnam
and my vietnam were a little different.

223
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,640
Bach ma national park
is bach ma national park.

224
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,320
I don't care where you
sleep after seeing it.

225
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,850
You did bach ma national park?

226
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,750
That's a pretty gnarly
hikeetting up there.

227
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,180
What are you implying?

228
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,650
That I don't do gnarly?

229
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,080
That you don't do hike.

230
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,710
Okay,fine.

231
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,830
I helicoptered to the top.

232
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,810
But there were plenty of sweaty hikers up
there who told me all about how stp it was.

233
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,290
Boo.Already.What a drag.

234
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,530
Gregory,hello.

235
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,910
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

236
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,740
Ah,this is my dear friend ryan.

237
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,490
He's a teacher at naooo's schL.

238
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,590
I double-booked tonight.

239
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,780
I'm atrocious I know.

240
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,570
Shall we go?

241
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,280
Bye,ryan.

242
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,410
Okay,we are good on the news.

243
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,930
All we need now is another segment.

244
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,200
You know,a lifestyle piece.

245
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,930
Something buzz worthy.

246
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,660
- I got a
no-brainer.- Yeah?

247
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,490
Rumor has it,there's a naked picture
of the principal's daughter out there.

248
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,540
A sex text,people.

249
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,640
No,absolutely not.

250
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,930
That's out of the question.

251
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,360
Guaranteed eyeballs,dude.

252
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,530
No,the blaze's not in the
business of slinging mud.

253
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,290
Other pitches.Think positive,people.

254
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,900
Uh,think "only beverly hills.

255
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,080
All right,boss man,I got one for ya.

256
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,890
Whatcha got?

257
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,750
New student just
transferred to west bev.

258
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,630
Apparently,he placed second in this
big deal national tennis tournament.

259
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,080
Apparently,he's going
to go pro in a year.

260
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,290
Interesting story,right?

261
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,440
Balancing a pro tennis
career with high school.

262
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,750
Uh,do you have a name?

263
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,550
Teddy montgomery.

264
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,200
As in the son of spence montgomery.

265
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,720
Major movie star,people,come on.

266
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,490
Yeah.

267
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,620
That's perfect!

268
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,750
But I sussed him out,and he
has some "no interview" policy.

269
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,800
Apparently,his dad's been burned
in the media a couple times.

270
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,100
damn.

271
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,010
Damn,damn,damn.

272
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,000
That-that would've been perfect.

273
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,840
Ah,that sucks.

274
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,510
Anyway,um,any other ideas?

275
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,250
- Anyone else?
- Uh,navid,if you really want to interview teddy,

276
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,900
I can ask him to make an exception.

277
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,260
He might do it,since we're old friends.

278
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,540
Really?

279
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,580
That'd be friggin' awesome.

280
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,420
Right?

281
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,870
no,that-that'd be
friggin' awesome.Yeah.

282
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,010
Hello?

283
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,600
Annie.Hi.

284
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,620
Hi.

285
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,230
Hi.

286
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,580
Sorry.This...

287
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,580
this is awkward.

288
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,060
Uh,you called me.So...

289
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,840
look,I-I heard a rumor tonight,

290
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,080
and I wanted to tell you.

291
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,160
Because...

292
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,220
if it were me,I would want to know.

293
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,900
What is it?

294
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,880
Okay,apparently someone
has a text of you.

295
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,020
Like...

296
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,500
like a naked text.

297
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,720
- oh,my god.
- It might just be a rumor...

298
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,300
um,I-I have to go.

299
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,290
I have to go.Bye.

300
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,390
What?

301
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,720
Yeah,I-I just,uh,wanted
you to know the rumor,dude.

302
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:01,300
Yeah,um,look,thing is,me and
annie,we're-we're doing our own thing now.

303
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,940
So,uh,I'm done dealing with her crap.

304
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,020
All right?

305
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,840
I'll talk to you later,man.

306
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,080
You know,ade,I've been thinking.

307
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,790
The teddy story's a little soft.

308
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,890
I was thinking out
covering the sex piece.

309
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,670
What?

310
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,210
Well,I won't mention annie's name.

311
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,490
I'll just,you know,talk about
the phenomenon in general.

312
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,840
I mean,sex texts are big in high school.

313
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,770
Okay,navid,you can't do that.

314
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,360
Everyone will know it's about annie.

315
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,140
Yeah,but we need a great story.

316
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,690
And you have one.

317
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,030
Teddy,remember?

318
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,190
Come on.

319
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,240
That's not nearly as interesting.

320
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,260
No,but it is!

321
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,760
Honestly,you have no idea
how juicy teddy's life is.

322
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,880
His godfather is marlon brando.

323
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,780
Could you imagine?

324
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,450
Baby,you can't do the sext.

325
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,910
But teddy is amazing.

326
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,300
Trust me.He is beyond amazing.

327
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,200
You were compl ely out of line.

328
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,690
You don't talk to people that way.

329
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,980
But jen is psychotic.

330
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,250
And I don't care about jen.

331
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,150
I care about you.

332
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,340
Look at me.

333
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,900
She said naomi asked you
to stay away from her.

334
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,830
Is that true?

335
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,220
Well,okay,then.That's it.

336
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,450
When someone says
they are done with you,

337
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,950
you've gotta believe them.

338
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,010
Remember what they taught you in utah.

339
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,060
Stay away from people
who trigger bad behavior.

340
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,060
People like naomi.

341
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,510
I know.

342
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,450
I know.

343
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,800
Just stick to the plan,honey.

344
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:43,960
You need structure.

345
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,340
Downtime is when you get into trouble.

346
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,080
You're still going to join a team,right?

347
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:49,840
Good.

348
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,730
You'll make some friends,like
you had on long island.

349
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,930
It's not going to be the same.

350
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,380
So here's a question.

351
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,290
How hard could it possibly be to
make a flower garden symmetrical?

352
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,180
- Hi,honey.
- Ma hey,baby.

353
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,710
Liam.

354
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,110
So I asked the gardener to trim
back the roses a little bit,right?

355
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,520
I get there and the left side is
about six inches wider than the right.

356
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,660
Now could you imagine what would happen if I
did that kind of shoddy work in my business?

357
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,170
hey,maybe that's the answer.

358
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,000
What I'm going to do,is I'm going
to invite the gardener's wife

359
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,070
over for a little plastic surgery,

360
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:26,900
and I'm going to give her one big
beautiful d-cup and tiny little a-cup.

361
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,330
That's a good idea--
bully the gardener.

362
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,060
Hey.

363
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,750
Correct me if I'm wrong,

364
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,880
but I thought the whole
idea of my dropping $20,000

365
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:40,260
so you could sleep in a tent was so
that you would lose the attitude problem.

366
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,090
Just saying.

367
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,140
That's enough,liam.

368
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,210
Help me,honey.

369
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,780
walking on thin ice,young man.

370
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,490
You know,you're very lucky
I didn't call the police

371
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,020
and tell them how you stole my
patient's edit cards last year.

372
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,290
Liam knows,and he's grateful.

373
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,620
He better be grateful.

374
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:03,190
'Cause if I see a sign of any bad
behavior from you,I'm makg the call,

375
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,260
young man,and trust me,juvie is nothing
at all like you're little mamby-pamby

376
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:12,010
"let's get in touch with our
feelings" wilderness crap.

377
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,900
You understand me?

378
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,650
You have to understand,this
is really important to navid.

379
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,960
Okay,the blaze,it's everything.

380
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,320
And your life is so interesting.

381
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,820
why are you smiling at me like that?

382
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,880
Okay,teddy,mmm.

383
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,430
Will you do it for me?

384
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,580
Please.

385
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,720
Pretty please.

386
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:40,890
Of course.

387
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,690
wasn't ever a question.

388
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,050
I just enjoy watching
beautiful girls beg.

389
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,200
You're evil.

390
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,970
Oh,come on.Don't act surprised.

391
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,490
You of all people know me.

392
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,840
Yeah,well,I thought you might've
grown up after a few years.

393
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,070
What's the fun in that?

394
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:00,320
although,rumor has it you've grown up.

395
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,360
Whatever could you be talking about?

396
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,240
Come on,ade.

397
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,040
What's been going on?

398
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,450
Mm,not much.

399
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,890
give or take a pregnancy.

400
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,840
That's intense,ade.

401
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,310
Was the baby navid's?

402
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,430
No.

403
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,830
But he was really great through it.

404
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,550
I mean,he actually wanted to
marry me and help raise her.

405
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,100
It was a her.

406
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,280
Um,but in the end,I just wasn't ready.

407
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,110
What?

408
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,270
Why do you look so serious?

409
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,010
You're never serious.

410
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,260
Are you okay now?

411
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,220
Me?Yeah.

412
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:53,890
I'M...good.

413
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,130
I'm on track.

414
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,720
Good.

415
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,110
'Cause you're pretty
important to me,you know?

416
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,040
- Hey.
- Hey.

417
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,570
Hey,buddy.

418
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,060
So it looks like I'm
doing my first interview.

419
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,310
Yeah?

420
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,910
Uh,yay.

421
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,920
Uh,that's-that's great.

422
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,590
Ah,denny!

423
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,150
- Donny.
- Right.Sorry.

424
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,340
So listen,you were going to show
me how to send an anonymous text.

425
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,720
I'd love to.

426
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:28,940
How about over dinner?

427
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,750
Tonight?

428
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,460
Um,I have plans.

429
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,100
Lunch tomorrow?

430
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,840
Off campus?

431
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,660
The farther the better.

432
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,180
I gotta go edit,but I'll meet
you ameet you at 12:15,okay?

433
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:40,750
Don't forget.

434
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
I'll meet you in the cafeteria?

435
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,330
Oh,actually,the media lab.

436
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,260
- Hi,naomi.
- Bye,naomi.

437
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,350
Oh,he seems stressed.

438
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,320
It's the blaze.

439
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,650
He just wants it to be a success so bad.

440
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:56,830
He's even considering doing a segment on
that supposed text,sext,that's going around.

441
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,340
You've heard of it,right?

442
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,730
Of annie?

443
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,430
Mmm.Yeah.He should run the story.

444
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,710
Come on,naomi.

445
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,790
Whatever annie did,she
doesn't deserve that.

446
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,190
I can't believe someone would take
a picture of it and send it around.

447
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,160
How evil is that?

448
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,230
Your ball.

449
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,730
come on,buddy.

450
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,550
What's the deal?Where's your head at?

451
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,920
Just,uh,girl trouble.

452
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,430
Jen?

453
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,680
I'm playing with fire,man.

454
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,350
Cardinal rule-- don't like
her more than she likes you.

455
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,010
That,my friend,is why
you're still single.

456
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:37,790
Trust me-- I like deb way
more than she likes me.

457
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,880
Yeah,I know that's true.

458
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,320
What?What?

459
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:40,930
Nothing.

460
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,240
It's your ball,man.

461
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,550
All right,here's the thing with jen.

462
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,000
I don't have a chance.

463
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,970
I mean,the other guys she's
dating,they're seriously loaded.

464
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,880
Well,did you tell her
about your pension plan?

465
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,040
Trust me,in about 40 years when
those benefits start kicking in,

466
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,620
she's gonna be happy you're a teacher.

467
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,580
Get out.

468
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,600
Make me feel worse.

469
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,470
Not helping,huh?

470
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,770
Hey,just stay in the game.

471
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,130
As long as you're in it,you've
got a chance to win it.

472
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,410
Man,she is worth winning.

473
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,830
Speaking of winning...

474
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,780
kobe for the three.

475
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,610
I don't think so!

476
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,330
Not in my house.

477
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:16,890
Sorry.

478
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,750
Kobe got robbed there.

479
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,040
Is it true?

480
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,070
Oh,hey.

481
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,550
Is it true?

482
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,560
Did you take pictures?

483
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,620
How could you?

484
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,840
Look,this is not...

485
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,710
it's not going to be a big deal.

486
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,380
Not a big deal?!

487
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,210
What the hell?

488
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,970
Look,I'm not the one you
should worry about here,okay?

489
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,230
Talk to your friend naomi.

490
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,740
She's got a copy of the picture,too.

491
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,870
all right,you little grommets,listen up.

492
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,770
Everybody trying out for the
surf team,there are five heats.

493
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,930
Top three from each are gonna
move on to the next wave.

494
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,990
Any questions?

495
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,750
All right.

496
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,070
You four,I want to see you
be totally aggro out there.

497
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,670
Let's go.Let's do it.

498
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,820
so,uh,y are you out here?

499
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,580
I mean,aren't you supposed to be
like roger federer or something?

500
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,380
More like nadal.

501
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,340
but surfing's my first love,man.

502
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,930
It's the way I blow off steam.

503
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,710
Hey,can i borrow some wax?

504
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,400
I didn't know you surfed.

505
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,410
I used to.

506
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,020
Jones beach back in long island.

507
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,990
Long island.Wait.New york?

508
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,640
- You're from new york?
- Yeah.

509
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,280
How did I not know?

510
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,320
I'm-I'm from new york.

511
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,970
I mean,I-I moved when
I was eight,but still...

512
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,090
no,man,that qualifies.

513
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,100
Oh,boy.

514
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:04,980
Here it comes.

515
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,620
The whole,we're bros 'cause
we're both from new york thing.

516
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,310
- Clearly from L.A ?
- Yeah.

517
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,750
And what is that supposed to mean?

518
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,230
Nothing.I could just tell.

519
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,480
You and ryan hacrestave
that certain something.

520
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,080
Certain something.

521
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:24,160
I got to admit,I didn't take
you as a team kind of guy.

522
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:24,920
Well,I'm not.

523
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:28,160
But an idle liam makes
for very bad things.

524
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,260
All right,you five.

525
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,160
In the water.Let's go.Let's go!

526
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,840
Let's go do it.

527
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,070
Hey.

528
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,140
Just so you know,I didn't
sleep with your sister.

529
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,670
I don't want to talk about annie today.

530
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,570
Me and her-- we're-we're like
two different people,all right?

531
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,970
That's as fast as you can go?

532
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:43,070
That,my friend,is why
I love californ-I-A.

533
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,730
Vietnamese for pearls

534
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,360
liam?

535
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,520
You have to ta to naomi.

536
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,750
You have to tell her
that we didn't have sex.

537
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,630
I did.

538
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,260
You told her that it wasn't me?

539
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,700
Yeah.

540
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,840
I told her.She didn't believe me.

541
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,940
Well,did you tell her who it was?

542
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,930
Why not?Why wouldn't you?

543
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,880
I'm sorry.It's-it's complicated.

544
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,030
It's not complicated.

545
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,640
How-how is it complicated,liam?

546
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,000
You and i didn't have sex,and-

547
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,570
and you had sex with somebody else,

548
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,870
and if you don't tell naomi the truth,

549
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,290
she is going to ruin my life,liam.

550
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,290
I got to go.

551
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:56,490
Fiand ve,four,three,two.

552
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,600
I'm here today with teddy montgomery,

553
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:02,170
son of two-time academy award
winner,spence montgomery.

554
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,750
How you doing today,teddy?

555
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,110
Not too bad.Cool.

556
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,410
- So,let's dive right in.
- All right.

557
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,720
Word has it that you're a
pretty amazing tennis player.

558
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,440
According to my notes,you
ranked second at nationals?

559
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,920
Well,I was lucky.

560
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,740
I got a good draw.

561
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,430
yeah.

562
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,560
Gotcha.

563
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,860
uh,let-let me ask you this.

564
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:25,360
Um,you have to be pretty
arrogant to be an athlete,right?

565
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,450
Do you bring that arrogance
to your personal life?

566
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,560
Oh,well...

567
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,410
do you feel guilty about the fact that
your last name has opened so many doors?

568
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,990
How does it feel to know that you'll
never be as successful as your father?

569
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,140
Yeah,you've lived a pretty
charmed life,haven't you?

570
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,810
Anything bad ever happen to you?

571
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,860
What?No regrets?

572
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,180
So,you-you think you're perfect?

573
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:46,550
So,here's a question that I
think has been on everyone's mind.

574
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,350
Why did you turn to beverly hills?

575
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,310
Why not stay at exeter?

576
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,110
I missed california.

577
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,480
I mean,there's nothing quite like it.

578
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,400
Interesting.

579
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,280
So it has nothing to do with
the fact that you were kicked out

580
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,240
after being caught with two
naked girls in your room?

581
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,510
Or maybe you forgot.

582
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,460
Maybe you were so epsy sleing
around that you can't remember

583
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,920
who you did or didn't sleep with.

584
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,370
I didn't forget.I just...

585
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,520
I don't kiss and tell.

586
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,730
Please don't send out that picture.

587
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,560
It's gonna ruin my life.

588
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,180
Naomi,please.

589
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,240
Erase it.

590
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,590
I'll-I'll do anything that you want.

591
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,100
Anything.

592
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,230
You know what I want?

593
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:43,890
I want you to stop lying.

594
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,030
I'm not lying.

595
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,660
Admit that you had sex with liam.

596
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,530
I didn'T.

597
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,820
Admit it.

598
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,040
I...

599
00:27:55,930 --> 00:28:00,240
if I admit it,will you
just erase the picture?

600
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,620
I just want you to admit it.

601
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,140
Fine.

602
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,710
Fine.I did it.

603
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,890
I had sex with liam,okay?

604
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,260
Are you happy?

605
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:17,140
Please.Just don't send it.

606
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,110
What the hell was that?

607
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,360
You just attacked him.

608
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,820
What?I'm a journalist.

609
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,020
Journalists don't pull punches.

610
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,590
Yeah,well,they also don't attack someone

611
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,100
just because that person
used to date their girlfriend.

612
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,980
You're paranoid.

613
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,360
Really?

614
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,560
Hey,teddy?

615
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,840
Can I catch a ride
to the beach with you?

616
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,450
Sure thing.

617
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,280
Awesome.

618
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,830
Thank you.

619
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,020
Go,dixon!

620
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:06,270
and everybody else.

621
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,470
All right,ladies,tone
down the enthusiasm.

622
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,360
You're making a scene.

623
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:15,060
What if I told you I'm having doubts
about whether annie slept with liam?

624
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,100
I would say that's great.

625
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,240
That's great.

626
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,780
Relax,okay?I said I'm having doubts.

627
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,560
She's not in the clear yet.

628
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,890
okay,I got to say,dixon's pretty good.

629
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,790
He's gonna make the team.

630
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:39,110
And when he does,he's
gonna be in a great mood,

631
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,090
which means it's gonna be an
awesome time to talk to him.

632
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,040
Clearly we have to keep
her away from him tonight.

633
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,650
Uh,clearly.

634
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,720
What are you talking about?Of
course you made the team.

635
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,780
I wiped out twice.

636
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,800
Whatever,man.You know?

637
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,440
Who cares.

638
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,800
All right,everybody,listen up.

639
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,430
Here's the team.

640
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,440
Yes!

641
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,910
We all made it,man!We all made it.

642
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,050
- Great!
- Yes!

643
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,050
I wanted to thank you for
the beautiful necklace.

644
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,700
- does this lock?
- Oh,yeah.

645
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,390
glad you like it.

646
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,360
hey.

647
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,510
Dude,silver called me again.

648
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,380
I don't know what else to do.

649
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,850
I already told her it's over.

650
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,160
Guess she's just having
a hard time believing it.

651
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,330
When someone says they're done...

652
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,090
you got to believe them.

653
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,640
Wait.You talking about naomi?

654
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,480
'Cause,uh,that's different.

655
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,240
naomi is not over you.

656
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,070
What do you mean?

657
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,420
Ade told me,but you
didn't hear it from me.

658
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,270
Ade will kill me.

659
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,450
Actually,she already wants
to kill me,but what the hell.

660
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,040
No,man.She's wrong.

661
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,580
Naomi told me to leave her alone.

662
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:37,420
Come on,you know girls never
really say what they mean.

663
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:40,480
They're
always,like,double-,riple-talking.

664
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,570
Yeah,they're not dudes.

665
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,660
You know,we're very straightforward.

666
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,810
- Yeah.
- Amen.

667
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:49,540
I mean,girls,they're all,like,"hey,yeah,babe
"do you want japanese or chinese food?

668
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,240
'Cause,you know,I really don't care?

669
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,100
And then,you're,like,"yeah,let's
get me japanese,"

670
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,650
and then,they're pissed,'cause
they wanted chinese.

671
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,380
Why they didn't just say
chinese-- dude,I'll...

672
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,310
I'll never know.

673
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,900
So,if naomi says she wants
me to leave her alone...

674
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,630
she wants some chinese food,kid.

675
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,500
I mean,she wants you to try harder.

676
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,210
Chinese food?

677
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,630
Chinese food.

678
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,630
Silver,are you okay?

679
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,460
come on.

680
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,290
Let's go,all right?

681
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,210
Come on,come on,silver.

682
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,670
Come on,come on.it's okay.

683
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,400
Ade.

684
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,160
Stay.I'll take her home.

685
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,460
Come on.

686
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,220
Come on.

687
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,390
Can I talk to you for a second?

688
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,820
Yeah.

689
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,350
Look,uh,I was a jerk.

690
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,090
I ambushed teddy because he was your ex.

691
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,140
And it was a stupid way to handle it.

692
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,450
I should have just been
up front and told you

693
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,690
that I didn't want the
two of you to be friends.

694
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,920
That's your apology?

695
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,970
I-I said I acted like a jerk.

696
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,650
Then why are you still acting like one?

697
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,720
I'm not.I'm just being honest with you.

698
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:04,610
What's the big deal?

699
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,630
It's not like the two of you
talked the past few years?

700
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,430
Yeah,well,we go to tool schnow.

701
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,050
I-I know.And you could say...

702
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,250
you could say "hey" or whatever...

703
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,900
oh,thank you.Thanks.

704
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,140
Ade,it's not like he's some random dude.

705
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,210
He's-he's the guy you
lost your virginity to.

706
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,480
I think it's only fair for me to ask y

707
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,710
not to talk to him if it
makes me uncomfortable.

708
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,860
You know what makes me uncomfortable?

709
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,630
The fact that you can't trust me.

710
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,450
Ade.

711
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,140
Could-could you...

712
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,960
ade,wait.

713
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,940
I gotta talk to naomi.

714
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,010
I'm so sorry.

715
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,710
She's not here.

716
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,340
That's her car.

717
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,430
Aren't you the little detective.

718
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,810
Listen,why don'you give me a message
and I will be sure to pass it on.

719
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,090
Yeah,whatever.

720
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,030
I'll just talk to her at school.

721
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,460
Just what are you planning
on talking to her about?

722
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:09,010
I didn't want to tell naomi
what happened between us

723
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,120
because I didn't want
to hurt her even more.

724
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:14,350
I thought there was no
point,because she was done with me.

725
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,670
But she's not.

726
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,210
And she needs to know the truth.

727
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,490
And when I deny it?

728
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,300
Who do you think she's going to believe?

729
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,790
The person who she relies
on most in this world,

730
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,050
or you,the person who broke her heart?

731
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,500
You're not going to
lose your temper,re you?

732
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,280
Because your mom says if you do,

733
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,170
You're going straight to juvie.

734
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:41,210
You bitch.

735
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,410
You're unbelievable!

736
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:56,080
Jeffrey didn't think that you were ready
to come home after the wilderness program.

737
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,640
Like a fool,I said you were.

738
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,920
I am.

739
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,300
You punched her door!

740
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:02,680
Why the hell did you go over
there in the first place?

741
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,590
Go over where?

742
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,550
I was boiling water and tripped.

743
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,500
This idiot tried to catch the pot.

744
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,260
Burned himself good.

745
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,080
- I'll take a look at it.
- No.

746
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,760
Nah.He's be fine.

747
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,810
He just needs to think
before he does stupid stuff.

748
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,690
Okay.All right.

749
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,460
I will.

750
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,470
Od.'Cause next time,you're on your own.

751
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,610
Hey.

752
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,650
naomi,hi.

753
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,310
How's silver doing?

754
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,520
she'll be okay.

755
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,870
Oh,good.

756
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,440
I saw your teacher earlier.

757
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,750
Ew,ryan?

758
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,750
what's the deal with that?

759
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,870
Are you,like,seriously
into him or something?

760
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,230
No.

761
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,520
Of course I am not
"likseriously into him.

762
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,670
" Thank you.

763
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:49,480
Same time tomorrow.

764
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,720
Look,here's the thing.

765
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:54,280
L.A.Is a very small town.

766
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:57,650
And if a girl isn't careful,she
can get labeled a gold digger.

767
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,630
And that,my dear,is
something that I can't afford.

768
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,560
Scares the rich men right off.

769
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,780
okay.

770
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:08,040
Keeping an economically,you know,

771
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:11,860
challenged teacher around protec
from that pesky little label.

772
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,080
Oh,you're just using him.Thank god.

773
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,530
Of course I am using him.

774
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:22,400
The other night,I accidentally double-booked
a date with ryan and with gregory.

775
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,530
Gregory is one of those
paranoid billionaires

776
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,500
who thinks that women
are only after his money.

777
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,060
Of course,we are.

778
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,490
You should've seen the
look on gregory's face

779
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,130
when he saw ryan walking
back to his crappy little car.

780
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,400
Suddenly I was mother teresa.

781
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,050
you're brilliant.

782
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,700
Thank you,darling.

783
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:42,010
So,did you figure out
how to send out that text?

784
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,690
Yes!

785
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,820
Finally.

786
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,880
After a two hour lunch at ihop.

787
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,690
So,did you send the text?

788
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,330
no.

789
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,130
I don't know.It just...

790
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,160
it's pretty evil.

791
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:55,610
I would ruin her life.

792
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,430
She ruined yours.

793
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,100
Yeah.

794
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,580
If she slept with liam.

795
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,470
If?

796
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,260
Something's just not adding up.

797
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:06,220
I mean,annie's been saying
all along it wast heR.

798
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:09,390
But then liam said it wasn't her.

799
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:13,450
Well,did he say who it was?

800
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,330
Well,no.

801
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,890
But maybe if I just
ask him again he'll...

802
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,480
what?

803
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,620
Nothing.

804
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,570
What?

805
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,610
Nothing!

806
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,270
You're just...

807
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,050
so sweet.

808
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,860
So optimistic.

809
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:32,960
I remember,before we all accepted
daddy's affairs as par for the course,

810
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,230
there was this incident.

811
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,620
Mommy had found some sort of proof

812
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:40,110
that daddy was sleeping
with florence canold.

813
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:44,100
But despite all the evidence,she
didn't want to believe it.

814
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:48,230
Everyone was talking about
what a fool our mother was.

815
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,790
But as I grew up,

816
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,240
I realized she wasn't a fool.

817
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,910
She was...

818
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,840
just optimistic.

819
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,780
Like you.

820
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:05,940
In fact,every day you remind
me more and more of our mother.

821
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,890
Naomi,what are you doing?

822
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,340
I'm sending out that text.

823
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:16,730
The evidence was all there.

824
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,590
I don't know what I was thinking.

825
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,960
Oh,my god,did you see the
principal's daughter naked?

826
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,790
nice rack.

827
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,880
Annie,I'm here for you,okay?

828
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,730
Thank you.

829
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,400
For-for warning me.I never
thanked you for warning me.

830
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:50,550
- It's okay.
- No.

831
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,270
No,it's not okay.

832
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,740
You were being nice and a friend.

833
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,890
I don't know why I never even called you
back when you called me this summer and...

834
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,420
annie.

835
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:59,090
It's okay.

836
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,940
It's going to be okay.

837
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,900
