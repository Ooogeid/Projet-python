1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:01,380
Previously on: 90210

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,150
We have a son together.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,310
I want to hire a private investigator to find him.

4
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,250
If we're gonna be together... wait.

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,680
You want to be with me here?

6
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,650
You're kind of an amazing kisser.

7
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,110
I'm a cop, you dumbass!

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,150
I want back on the lacrosse team,

9
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,180
Mr. matthews.

10
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,510
I'm gonna have to ask you

11
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,280
To take a paid leave of absence.

12
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,580
This is my job, harry.

13
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,610
What are the students gonna think?

14
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,610
Jason broke up with me.

15
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,250
My boyfriend from back home.

16
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,110
I don't think we can be friends if you're with ethan.

17
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,550
I don't want to keep us a secret anymore,

18
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,680
Ethan. it's wrong

19
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,310
To lie to naomi over and over again.

20
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,550
Guys, guys,

21
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,510
I heard they met over the summer.

22
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,750
Yeah, she's hot.

23
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,810
I would definitely hit that.

24
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,210
Her? what about him?

25
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,780
He's actually cute, in a...

26
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,750
Just-walked-off-a-catalogue kind of way.

27
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,180
They know?

28
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,780
How do they all know?

29
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,410
Didn't you get the text blast from george?

30
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,580
George?

31
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,110
I blocked his number in eighth grade.

32
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,250
Look at this.

33
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,210
What's up, everybody?

34
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,380
Dude,

35
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,610
That's nuts.

36
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,850
When did this happen?

37
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,250
After silver's party.

38
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,780
How much did you see?

39
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,380
I want details.

40
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,150
You dorks can't handle the details.

41
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,180
Oh, my god, george, you are so pathetic.

42
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,680
Why don't you go back to rehab?

43
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:05,250
All right, People. Let's settle. Everybody take their seats.

44
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,050
So, mr. matthews has taken a...

45
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,480
Student's virginity?

46
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,880
...leave of absence

47
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,580
Till we find a suitable substitute,

48
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,080
I am your new teacher.

49
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,110
I understand we are working

50
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,910
On madame bovary.

51
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,110
Anybody want to tell me where we are?

52
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,080
Anybody?

53
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,810
Has she tried to kill herself yet?

54
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,210
Oh, my god, are you serious? what?!

55
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,650
Are you serious?

56
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,950
Oh, wonderful. what? are you serious?!

57
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,850
Thank you! really?

58
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,680
Um, when did this become

59
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,080
The new principal's office?

60
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,650
Annie, thank you for joining us.

61
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,880
You want to...

62
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,380
Take your seat, so we can get started.

63
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,350
Annie.

64
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,650
Yeah?

65
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,150
You and me have to chat after school.

66
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,580
Okay.

67
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,410
Okay, then,

68
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,080
Madame-- right, it looks like we are on part three.

69
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,050
Hi, ladies.

70
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,080
Kel!

71
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,110
Hey! I thought you were coming back tomorrow.

72
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,110
Uh, I took an earlier flight.

73
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,610
-How are you? -good.

74
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,610
Aren't you supposed to be in class?

75
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,280
I have last period study hall.

76
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,110
And you're studying...?

77
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,110
The... the hallway architecture.

78
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,780
Thought it'd be a great art piece.

79
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,610
You know, the labyrinthine nature of the high school experience. mm.

80
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,610
-So? how was it? How's dylan? here, -hold this for me.

81
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,610
Well, dylan is dylan.

82
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,050
You know, nothing's changed.

83
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,010
Same cheekbones, same sideburns,

84
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,010
Same perfectly messy hairdo.

85
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,680
Same commitment issues.

86
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,350
I'm sorry. yeah.

87
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,510
How you doing?

88
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,250
Actually, really good.

89
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,910
I'm ok with him

90
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,910
Being there and me being here.

91
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,080
Just gonna leave myself open to all possibilities, you know?

92
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,150
Look at you with your advanced self-understanding.

93
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,180
I'm impressed.

94
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,680
Don't be.

95
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,710
I'm still a work in progress.

96
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,810
Hey, I saw that harry was teaching ryan's class.

97
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,850
Is he out sick or something?

98
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,210
Yeah. um, you missed some stuff when you were gone.

99
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,650
Mr. matthews, what do you say about the allegations?

100
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,210
No comment.

101
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,680
Sir, I'd just like to hear your side of the story, sir.

102
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,650
Navid, I respect your perseverance, okay, I really do,

103
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,150
But I said no comment, and I meant it.

104
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,880
Now go back to class before I break your camera.

105
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,410
I'm sure that's not the best way to rehabilitate your image, sir.

106
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,610
Navid, you want to give me a break?

107
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,550
Turn that thing off.

108
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,010
Ryan...

109
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,750
It isn't true, is it?

110
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,210
It's complicated.

111
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,210
No, it either is true or it isn't.

112
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,180
The guy I knew before I left

113
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,750
Wouldn't do something like this.

114
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,910
I just want you to tell me the truth.

115
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,610
I don't want to believe the rumors.

116
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,110
Why are you just running away like this?

117
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,880
I don't know what else I can say.

118
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,780
Sorry.

119
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,280
So dixon tells me you're rockin' the karaoke at your birthday party.

120
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,910
I'm so gonna make him sing.

121
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,210
Cool. whatever.

122
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,610
Yo, what's your deal?

123
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,010
Nothing. nothing.

124
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,980
I'm just... I'm supposed to meet naomi, so...

125
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,610
Chill.

126
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,080
She doesn't know anything about you and ethan.

127
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,880
You know? how do you know?

128
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,110
I saw you guys at my party. oh.

129
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,577
Naomi was going to walk in on you and the jock strap,

130
00:05:19,577 --> 00:05:20,650
But I distracted her.

131
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,380
You're welcome, by the way.

132
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,950
Wait, wait, wait, how do you know that she didn't see?

133
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,550
Because you're still alive.

134
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,150
You got to tell her soon.

135
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,750
I mean if she finds out from some random,

136
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,010
It ain't gonna be pretty.

137
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,380
Yeah. no, and I will.

138
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,650
I'm going to tell her right now.

139
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,810
Um, naomi, i...

140
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,250
I'm a mess.

141
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,380
I'm sorry.

142
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,950
My parents...

143
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,180
My mom filed the divorce papers today.

144
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,710
It's official-- I come from a broken home.

145
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,010
Um, I'm so sorry.

146
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,780
My parents throw in the towel,

147
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,710
My relationship with ethan is over.

148
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,310
I swear to god, if I get another piece of bad news,

149
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,880
I'm going to lose it.

150
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,480
I'm going to really lose it.

151
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,650
Um, i...

152
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,480
Is there anything that I can do at all?

153
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,780
I could use the support of my friends right now.

154
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,580
Hey, you guys feel like hitting up robertson this afternoon?

155
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,410
Well, I actually have to go blog about professor pervert, you know, but...

156
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,710
Maybe some other time?

157
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,080
Later.

158
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,550
How about you, annie?

159
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,010
Get our hairs did,

160
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,710
Followed by some retail therapy?

161
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,180
Um... sure, okay.

162
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,010
Thank you.

163
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,650
You really are  a good friend.

164
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,780
Hey, girly.

165
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,710
Poker game at meaghan's house tonight.

166
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,810
Are you in?

167
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,410
Oh, sounds like fun.

168
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:03,580
I wish I could, but I've got my own games to play.

169
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,010
Oh, that's cute

170
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,110
In a hannah montana on acid kind of way.

171
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,380
So 16, huh?

172
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,110
God, you've had an intense year.

173
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,810
Oh, it's been a seriously crazy ride.

174
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,710
New world, new school, new friends...

175
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,810
No boyfriend. yeah.

176
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,880
I have to talk to you about...

177
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,080
That's a really hard thing.

178
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,410
Trust me, I know.

179
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,910
I mean, since I broke up with ethan,

180
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,610
I've been so lonely.

181
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,480
What were you saying?

182
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,810
I really don't like this dress.

183
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:52,410
So, did you break up with jason before you left wizard of ox land?

184
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,450
No, after I got here.

185
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,480
Oh, were you the dumper or the dumpee?

186
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,210
It was mutual.

187
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,380
I mean, you can't fight geography, right?

188
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,950
That's too bad.

189
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,850
Sounds like you guys didn't really get a chance

190
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,580
To see what would have happened.

191
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,780
I mean, maybe you'd still be together if you hadn't moved out here.

192
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,980
Maybe. I don't know, part of me felt like

193
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,780
The breakup wasn't real, you know?

194
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,650
When things end because of distance

195
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,950
And not because of some big relationship problem,

196
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,950
It's kind of hard to get closure.

197
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,950
Be great if you could get closure and maybe see him again.

198
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,550
Yeah, I guess.

199
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,510
That's the dress.

200
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,910
That's the dress you should wear to the birthday you'll never forget.

201
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,080
Oh. guess who?

202
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,450
Soft hands...

203
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,850
Velvet voice...

204
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,580
Megan fox?

205
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,480
Oh, my god!

206
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,310
So... I've been thinking.

207
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,450
About?

208
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,410
About you and me,

209
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,510
And the fact that we are an "us" now.

210
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,280
"us"? that is my new favorite word.

211
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,650
We should do something together.

212
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,010
Like boyfriend-girlfriend stuff.

213
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,410
What'd you have in mind?

214
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,810
Like lunch? maybe a movie?

215
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,410
I was thinking maybe something a little bit more private.

216
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,710
Yeah? well, uh...

217
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,250
That's... that's really not going to work.

218
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,410
Why not?

219
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,150
I have a lot of footage to edit,

220
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,910
And, uh, it's about mr. matthews.

221
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,080
It's, it's  a really, really big story.

222
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,880
Oh, well, then I'll help you.

223
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,680
That way we can be hanging out together.

224
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,450
Well, the only thing is, um...

225
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,150
I can't have anybody else around when I'm doing this.

226
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,680
I kind of need to focus.

227
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:59,510
Okay, so I should just go, then?

228
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,480
I'll call you later, right?

229
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,450
Okay, yeah. thanks.

230
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,310
have fun.

231
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,450
"matthews dips in the kiddie pool"?

232
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,550
nice.

233
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,710
i think it's my best blog yet.

234
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,680
and i love it when my readers quote me back to me.

235
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,250
you're just biased against matthews

236
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,980
'cause he dated your sister.

237
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,280
well, yeah.

238
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,880
it's like, what if ethan rebounded

239
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,150
with some 'tween from junior high?

240
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,980
what do i care who ethan dates?

241
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,150
it's not like he's with...

242
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,450
ethan's with annie?!

243
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,210
yes, but dixon, i'm the only one that knows.

244
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,810
you cannot tell her that you know

245
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,180
or she'll think that i told you, you know?

246
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,780
and besides, they haven't told naomi yet,

247
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,150
and if she hears from somebody else...

248
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,610
hey, guys.

249
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,380
hey, ethan, so i was thinking...

250
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,650
i don't know

251
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,250
what you're getting annie for her birthday,

252
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,480
but let's make sure

253
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,010
she has an amazing day, okay?

254
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,610
i don't want to give her a chance

255
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,550
to miss jason. uh, why would she?

256
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,080
they're broken up.

257
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,180
yeah, but it sounds like jason's a really great guy,

258
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,910
and they were really close, kind of like you and i, so...

259
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,080
yeah, she seems to be doing okay.

260
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,050
yeah, that's what i thought until yesterday.

261
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,780
what happened yesterday?

262
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,250
we were shopping,

263
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,680
and she could not stop talking about jason.

264
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,450
i guess because the breakup was long-distance,

265
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,480
they just didn't get closure.

266
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,680
i don't know.

267
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,150
i just don't want her to feel alone

268
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,580
on her 16th birthday,

269
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,080
so let's make it extra special, yeah?

270
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,780
cool.

271
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,910
yeah, you gave me the facts

272
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,680
this morning, but did you really have to fire him?

273
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,410
i had no choice.

274
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,410
did he admit anything?

275
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,110
it doesn't matter what he said.

276
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,480
how could it not matter?

277
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,850
it's his reputation on the line.

278
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,780
kelly, allegations were made.

279
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,310
as principal, i had to act on them.

280
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,280
you're telling me

281
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,050
that you believe that ryan slept with a student?

282
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,410
i can't get into this

283
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,650
right now, kelly.

284
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,380
you have to trust me.

285
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,210
uh, is this a bad time?

286
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,480
i can come back later. no.

287
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,810
kimberly, i was just...

288
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,180
leaving

289
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,180
hi, kimberly, nice to meet you.

290
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,150
please sit down.

291
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,810
apparently, i'm not allowed back

292
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,880
into any more classes until you sign this.

293
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,580
uh, yes, i wanted to talk to you.

294
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,510
please sit down.

295
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,780
if this is about mr. matthews, i'm fine.

296
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,480
everything's fine.

297
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,150
an aura of fineness surrounds me.

298
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,050
i'm glad to hear that.

299
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,810
but, given the situation

300
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,850
i have trouble believing that you're really okay.

301
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,810
that's your problem, not mine.

302
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,250
are you angry at mr. matthews?

303
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,780
did he give you a bad grade,

304
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,950
maybe fail you on some test? no.

305
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,980
were you in a relationship with him?

306
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,480
why are you asking me?

307
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,980
i had nothing to do with this.

308
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,380
maybe you expressed some feelings

309
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,750
that he didn't return.

310
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,550
sounds like you're speaking from your own experience.

311
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,480
i mean, it would be understandable.

312
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,980
everybody in your class

313
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,350
loves him.

314
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,310
he's young, dynamic, not unattractive.

315
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,850
okay, i don't want to talk about this anymore.

316
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,650
can i go?

317
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,780
if i'm late for mr. hunt's class one more time, i'll be

318
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,850
in detention for life.

319
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,350
come back if you want to talk some more.

320
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,250
hello.

321
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,950
hello?

322
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,050
yoo-hoo, annie!

323
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,010
boy, do we have a surprise for you.

324
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,580
hey, guys.

325
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,480
annie, you will never guess who's here.

326
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,880
jason

327
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,010
hi, annie.

328
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,150
hey.

329
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,850
you could crush mint on those abs.

330
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,080
happy birthday.

331
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,320
jason... in california.

332
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,190
right here in our pool.

333
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,790
um, what are you doing here?

334
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,090
i was hoping to meet lauren conrad.

335
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,490
are these the right hills?

336
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,520
i would hug you, but i wouldn't

337
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,920
want to get you all wet.

338
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,790
i wouldn't mind. tabitha.

339
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
surprise!

340
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,850
what a surprise it is.

341
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,690
do you like

342
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,950
your birthday present?

343
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,090
he's from you?

344
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,320
you're from her?

345
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,790
no, i'm from kansas,

346
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,150
but naomi paid for the shipping labels.

347
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,690
your sweet 16 birthday is the most important day

348
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,950
of your life, second only to your wedding day, of course.

349
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,020
and no girl should spend that day without a man

350
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,020
by her side.

351
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,820
yeah, but... i-i told her

352
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,990
that we weren't together, but when she called,

353
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,650
i just couldn't resist

354
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,050
a chance to be with you on your big day. well, it's

355
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,490
all right, it's very good to see you.well, i'm gonna get going.

356
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,990
i know you guys must have

357
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,220
a ton to catch up on before dinner.

358
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,890
um... dinner?

359
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,720
yeah. i figured you would want jason

360
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,450
to meet all of your friends, you know,

361
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,850
before the big day and everything.

362
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,290
you and silver are in, right?

363
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,050
i have to call ethan. i think that's about it.

364
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,690
i'll take care of everything. don't you worry about a thing.

365
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,250
yay! you are so lucky to have made such great friends here.

366
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,790
yeah. um... so lucky.

367
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,650
adrianna. uh... hi.

368
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,650
hello, half of navid's face.

369
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,850
is the other half home?

370
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:52,950
uh... it's not a good time.

371
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,720
well, then when is?

372
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,990
i've called you a couple of times.

373
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,190
i've texted you.

374
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,520
tried to hook up at school. you've gone

375
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,120
all woodward and bernstein 'cause of this whole matthews story.

376
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,950
can we talk about this later, please? no, we can't.

377
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,720
you've been acting really weird lately.

378
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,290
wait. is... is there someone there?

379
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,620
yeah. uh... my baby sister iman.

380
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,920
adrianna, uh...

381
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,950
iman, this is adrianna.

382
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,750
hi, sweetie.

383
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,090
navid.

384
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,820
is this the young lady you told us about?

385
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,790
welcome, adrianna.

386
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,320
we've heard wonderful things about you.

387
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,450
come on in. please, please.

388
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,190
dad, no farsi, okay?

389
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,650
she's pretty, navid.

390
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,950
way too pretty for you.

391
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,190
please don't embarrass me.

392
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,450
keep your voice down, okay?

393
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,820
adrianna, it's so wonderful to meet you!

394
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:54,320
come in, come in. will you join us for dinner?

395
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,120
oh, mom, i think adrianna already has plans.

396
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,320
yeah. i wouldn't want to impose.

397
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,550
oh, nonsense.

398
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,820
you have to meet atoosa's family.

399
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,490
this is shah-lah and masood.

400
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,650
nice to meet you.

401
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,220
my cousin alex

402
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,590
and my beautiful daughter

403
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,290
shar-joon. hello.

404
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,390
hi. i'm adrianna.

405
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,650
anoosh, his cousin. hi.

406
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,690
i'm adrianna. oh, just shoot me now.

407
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,490
my brother-in-law iraj and his wife roza.

408
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,350
hey.

409
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,950
you hanging in there?

410
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,090
oh, you know. just, uh... walking roxy.

411
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,620
nobody else wants to be around me right now, so...

412
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,050
i'd be there if i could. roxy, come here.

413
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,820
but i guess i screwed that up for both of us for a while.

414
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:37,090
i really didn't think it was going to turn out like this.

415
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,490
i mean, i didn't... i didn't think.

416
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,990
maybe i deserve it.

417
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:42,990
no, you don't.

418
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,450
in a moment of extreme

419
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,190
masochism, i decided to read silver's blog.

420
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,590
you want to know the worst part, aside from the grammar?

421
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,620
these kids... they think i'm a sleazeball.

422
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,990
they really do.

423
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,020
you know the truth. that's what matters.

424
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,220
i don't know how you do it. how you spend your life

425
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,120
letting people think you're something you're not.

426
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,750
look, ryan, i know you've risked a lot for me.

427
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,990
i swear to you, i'm going to close this case as fast

428
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,990
as i can. then everything will be back to normal.

429
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,150
i'll be around.

430
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,350
do you guys always eat dinner like this?

431
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,150
um... no. not usually this small.

432
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,420
can i tempt you

433
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,820
with some more khoresht?

434
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,720
dad, please. she's had enough.

435
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,890
no, thanks. i couldn't possibly eat any more.

436
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,550
i'm stuffed. but you're

437
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,420
so small! you need to put some meat on your bones!

438
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,850
thank you.

439
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,050
so, navid,

440
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,450
why didn't you tell me

441
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,190
you play the drums?

442
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,020
or the doumbek? right?

443
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,550
oh, and he sings, too.

444
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,690
what? oh, yes.

445
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,720
really? uh-huh. when he was

446
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,620
little, he'd sing

447
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,090
all day long.

448
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,950
please tell me you have pictures.

449
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,790
better. we have video.

450
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,790
you wouldn't want to see them because

451
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,920
they're poorly edited, and you'd be wasting your time.

452
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,250
honey, he's right. what are we thinking,

453
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,950
talking about movies in front of such a talented actress?

454
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,750
we should be asking

455
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,620
you for details of your exciting

456
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,020
childhood.

457
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:13,320
more importantly, adrianna,

458
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,550
how are you doing since leaving

459
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,550
rehab?

460
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,250
mom.

461
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,250
um... it's fine.

462
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,950
i know that must have been

463
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,450
very difficult for you.

464
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,120
uh... i'm great.

465
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,390
i'm fine. really.

466
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,290
thank you.

467
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,590
mom-mom,

468
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,250
do you happen to have any dessert?

469
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,590
maybe something to tempt ade with?

470
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,790
of course, of course. lydia?

471
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,750
bring the desserts, please.

472
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,090
i'm sorry. it's okay.

473
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,220
I will have an iced tea

474
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,350
And the japanese pear salad with tiger prawns...

475
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,850
And dressing on the side.

476
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,920
Always.

477
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,820
Those little details.

478
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,620
You never seem to forget, do you?

479
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,690
I still remember the way ethan takes his coffee.

480
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,620
You guys dated?

481
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,190
Yeah. for a long time.

482
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,850
We managed to stay friends like you and annie.

483
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,690
Of course I stayed friends with annie.

484
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,320
I mean, it's not just any girl

485
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,820
Whose idea of having a good time is sneaking

486
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,450
Into a jayhawks game.

487
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,020
Hey, just that once.

488
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,020
I thought security was going to throw us out on our asses

489
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,690
but she managed to sweet-talk the guard into letting us stay

490
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,320
By saying that I was a foreign exchange

491
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,990
Student that was leaving in the morning.

492
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,990
True story.

493
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,320
Seems like the silliest moments between couples

494
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,390
Are the ones that linger the longest.

495
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,020
So, jason, is...

496
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,390
Is this your first time

497
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,190
To california? yes. but, hopefully,

498
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,320
Not the last. I'm actually thinking about going to ucla.

499
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,350
You would be in l.a.

500
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,690
Yeah. I'm going to check out

501
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,890
The campus while I'm here.

502
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,120
Just like we talked about.

503
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,220
That was a long time ago.

504
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,650
Don't you have two more years before college?

505
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,950
what's the rush?

506
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,390
I thought I told you. I'm a senior.

507
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,290
I need to decide soon.

508
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,920
Yeah, ucla is almost impossible to get into, though, dude.

509
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,290
I mean, you have some

510
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,920
Backup schools lined up?

511
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,920
Jason is top of the class, all-state football.

512
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,390
Ucla is his...

513
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,420
Backup school

514
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,520
You're smart, handsome and athletic.

515
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,120
Distance wouldn't be enough

516
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,390
For me to let go of this one.

517
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,250
I'm parched.

518
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,150
I'm just going to go check on that iced tea.

519
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,590
So, more details.

520
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,050
How long have you known annie?

521
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,650
Since grade school.

522
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,390
We lived right around the block from each other.

523
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,790
Seems like our lives always seemed to cross.

524
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,520
That is so sweet!

525
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,250
I got to go to the bathroom

526
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,450
Excuse me, please.

527
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,450
So, uh, anything new back home?

528
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,790
I know. I'm sorry.

529
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,690
Naomi planned this whole dinner before I knew anything about it.

530
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,690
I thought you weren't even in contact with jason anymore.

531
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,620
I haven't been since we broke up.

532
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,190
Did you guys actually break up or just take a break?

533
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,850
We broke up. cross my heart. I was there.

534
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,350
Then why is he considering colleges

535
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,790
Based on where you live?

536
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,650
Look, we started dating in junior high.

537
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,320
Jason probably just assumed

538
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,290
That we'd always be together.

539
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,190
And maybe because of the fact that we broke up on the phone,

540
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,090
He didn't get enough closure.

541
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,720
Yeah, so I've heard. did you get enough closure?

542
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,620
Ethan, I want to be with you, nobody else.

543
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,320
Then I think you should tell him about us.

544
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,050
I don't want to hurt him.

545
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,950
And he's only here for a couple of days

546
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,920
And then he's gone. why make him feel bad?

547
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,920
'cause I want him to know that we're together.

548
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,350
And I wanted naomi to know the same thing,

549
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,750
But you didn't want to upset her.

550
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,490
How is that different?

551
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,535
Hey, is everything okay?

552
00:22:38,535 --> 00:22:39,550
yeah,

553
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,320
Great.

554
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,690
Good, well, your iced tea has arrived,

555
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,750
So you don't have to really wait here for it anymore.

556
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,190
Great.

557
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,090
You are becoming one of my

558
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,420
All-time favorite customers.

559
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,850
Aw, aren't you sweet?

560
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,850
You're under arrest

561
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,520
For drug possession with the intent to sell.

562
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,050
You gotta be kidding me.

563
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:08,420
Come on. after all those times I hooked you up?

564
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,090
Just can't trust anyone these days.

565
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,020
So do you want to do the ten years

566
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,750
I can nail you on right now,

567
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,990
Or do you want to vouch for me to your boss?

568
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,850
Give me a sit-down and let him know how I'm your newest dealer?

569
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,320
Fancy meeting you here.

570
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,550
I know. nine bedrooms in the house

571
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,550
And I still have to share a bathroom with dixon.

572
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,320
Ooh, poor dixon.

573
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:35,150
'cause as I recall, you were never really good at sharing.

574
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,020
Hey, only where french fries are concerned.

575
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,090
You know, this isn't how I pictured us

576
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,590
On the eve of your 16th birthday,

577
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,750
But I'm glad I'm here.

578
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,420
It was nice of you to come.

579
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:46,090
Yeah, but weird, too.

580
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,490
Yeah, right? yeah.

581
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,950
I'm, I'm sorry. does that mean...?

582
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,620
No, not at all.

583
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,220
Actually, it's exactly what

584
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,890
Every ex-boyfriend/houseguest wants to hear.

585
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,750
Uh. well, you know, even with all the weirdness,

586
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,790
I'm just glad to have

587
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,520
Someone to hang out with who doesn't make me feel

588
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,890
Like I have to try so hard.

589
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,250
What do you mean?

590
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,090
Oh, I don't know. I mean, it's just

591
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,450
I feel like I need to be so on all the time.

592
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,920
I mean, if they saw me

593
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,450
Hanging out in plaid pajamas,

594
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,790
It'd be, like, "ooh, social suicide."

595
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,650
I'd forgotten how much fun

596
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:17,950
You were to be around, annie.

597
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,020
You're sweet.

598
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,950
You know what? that's a lie.

599
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,520
I didn't forget. I tried.

600
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,650
Believe me, I tried.

601
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:34,620
But annie, our relationship... it was something special.

602
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,390
Yo, jason,

603
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,820
Come on! let's go!

604
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:43,350
Hey, come on. I already set the game up.

605
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,990
We're battling some dudes from michigan,

606
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,320
And they already talking trash.

607
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,390
Come on, man. let's do this.

608
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,150
Good night.

609
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,230
Jason, can I get you anything else?

610
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,560
No, ma'am, thank you.

611
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,260
You know, when you're at ucla,

612
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,025
You should really come by and see us.

613
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:05,760
absolutely.

614
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,230
Now, do you need any recommendations?

615
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,530
I'd be happy to write you one.

616
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,690
Ah! there is the birthday girl!

617
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:13,760
Happy birthday.

618
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,760
Thank you.

619
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,390
I cannot believe

620
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:19,260
That you are 16 years old.

621
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,990
Okay, I am late for a photo shoot.

622
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,590
Happy birthday. good-bye, my love.

623
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,960
Bye, sweetie.

624
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,360
Bye, jason.

625
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,830
I got an early meeting as well. happy birthday.

626
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,030
Okay. I love you.

627
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,460
Jason. love you, too, baby.

628
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,490
Nice to see you. good luck on your tour.

629
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,190
Thank you. thank you.

630
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,430
Uh, what are you gonna do, one of those star homes tours?

631
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,130
Campus tour, ucla.

632
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,030
If we're living close to each other again,

633
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,290
Maybe things might work out

634
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,030
A little different for us.

635
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,260
Um, jason,

636
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,990
Um, I mean, who knows

637
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:54,130
If we'd still be together if I hadn't moved?

638
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,290
Maybe,

639
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,260
Sure.

640
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,260
But we broke up,

641
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,330
And I moved on.

642
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,230
So we're really over.

643
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,730
Yeah.

644
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,090
What about the kiss? i...

645
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,790
You totally took me by surprise.

646
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,830
And I am so sorry

647
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,830
If I misled you in any way.

648
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,130
Okay.

649
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,890
Maybe I'll just go home.

650
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,460
No, please,

651
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,990
Don't. stay.

652
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,260
I mean, the truth is, we were friends for a long time

653
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,260
Before we started dating,

654
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,330
and I want all my friends at my party tonight.

655
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,290
So, come on. you can't deny a girl's birthday wish, right?

656
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,990
I'm sorry. I was awkward last night.

657
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,190
No, no, no, I'm sorry. my mom had no right

658
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,930
To bring up that whole rehab thing.

659
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,130
Yeah, she did. your parents paid for it.

660
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,160
But it's bad enough that they had to bore you

661
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,160
With those stupid stories.

662
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,430
It was cute.

663
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,990
But how many servings of khoresht

664
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,090
Do they expect one person to eat, right?

665
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,460
See, this, this is exactly why I didn't want you

666
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,930
To meet my family because they can be lame at times.

667
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,090
Well, actually, I thought they were lovely.

668
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,090
You're just saying that to be nice.

669
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,910
No, seriously,

670
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,690
I wish my family was that big and close.

671
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,960
Yeah? mm-hmm.

672
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,330
So, yeah, obviously, I was a little embarrassed when your mom

673
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,130
Brought up the whole rehab thing,

674
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,690
But the fact that they knew the entire time,

675
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,190
And they still treated me

676
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,390
Like a member of the family, mm-hmm.

677
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,490
That was incredibly cool.

678
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,060
So were good.

679
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,630
I like you, navid, okay?

680
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,190
And the more I know,

681
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,790
The more I like.

682
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,160
You just have to be honest with me.

683
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,130
About everything?

684
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,260
Everything.

685
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,530
Can you do that?

686
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,860
I'm a virgin.

687
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,830
What? what?!

688
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,230
See, funny, right?

689
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,830
I didn't want to disappoint you, okay?

690
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,530
'cause I figured you'd bolt, so, uh...

691
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,890
So you've been keeping your distance.

692
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,030
Yeah.

693
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,690
I wanted, I wanted it to be special.

694
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,460
I thought you expected something different,

695
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,790
And you are so...

696
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,330
I'm not expecting anything.

697
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,730
No?

698
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,990
No.

699
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,690
Except, um,

700
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,660
A little less of that, um--

701
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,690
What's your mom's favorite dish?

702
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:30,790
Khoresht.

703
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,260
Khore, khore... I can't say it!

704
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,460
Back of the throat. khoresht.

705
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:35,830
Khoresht. yeah.

706
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,960
Khoresht. khoresht? you got it.

707
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,490
Hey, annie. hmm?

708
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:48,960
So, jason seems like a pretty awesome guy.

709
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,660
He's clearly still into you.

710
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:52,660
Maybe you guys should give it another shot.

711
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,530
Yeah, um, naomi, about that, thank you so much

712
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,030
For flying jason in.

713
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,860
Hey, let's go out again tonight.

714
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,690
It was so much fun last night.

715
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:02,530
We can go to the beach, maybe surfing.

716
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,390
Let me get back to you on that.

717
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,090
Hey, are you still mad about last night?

718
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,490
Define mad.

719
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,960
Look, I know the whole having- my-current-boyfriend

720
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,360
Go-to-dinner- with-my-ex-boyfriend-

721
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,390
When-my-current-boyfriend

722
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,060
Isn't-really-a-boyfriend- at-all thing

723
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,590
Is, is beyond- the-charts strange, but...

724
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,890
No, what's strange is being in a situation

725
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,130
That's so complicated

726
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,590
That we can't even tell people

727
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,290
We're together. does that make you happy?

728
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,290
No.

729
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,790
Me, either.

730
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,590
I've done complicated, annie, I didn't like it.

731
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:34,960
I want things between us to be simple, you know?

732
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,090
I want that, too.

733
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,830
Great, then let's

734
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,960
Clean this whole mess up and tell naomi and jason the truth.

735
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,590
Um...

736
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,490
What?

737
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,090
I just, I just want to wait

738
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,960
Until jason gets home to tell him.

739
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,830
Why? you don't still have feelings for him...

740
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,990
No, no. um,

741
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,490
No, but I think

742
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,830
He still has them for me.

743
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,490
Okay, don't freak out, but

744
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,230
Jason kissed me last night.

745
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:03,960
Perfect, yeah.

746
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,360
Come on, ethan. it just happened.

747
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:06,890
You know why? '

748
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:08,290
cause he thinks you're still available.

749
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,790
I didn't kiss him back.

750
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,560
That was big of you. have fun with jason.

751
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:29,290
I never thought my star detention guest

752
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,030
Could be on time for anything.

753
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,360
Only when it's important.

754
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,690
This is important.

755
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,160
You know, you seem like a good kid.

756
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,960
Seriously, dude, I don't want to hear it.

757
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,330
All I want to do is make some cash.

758
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,960
Get a job at starbucks.

759
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:44,490
Look, if you're not sure about me, then just say it.

760
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:47,030
Eric said he'd vouch for me and that you'd hook me up.

761
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,560
But if he bailed,

762
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,560
Then tell me now 'cause I got clients waiting.

763
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,630
You have no idea how long I've waited for this.

764
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,330
It takes a special kind of sleazebag

765
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,330
To sell drugs to kids.

766
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,830
You're under arrest.

767
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,130
Hands where we can see them.

768
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,330
Thank you.

769
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,490
No, no, seriously, thank you, annie.

770
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,930
Happy birthday.

771
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,090
You're the best.

772
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,990
Thank you, thank you, everyone for being here

773
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:38,690
To celebrate my darling

774
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,260
Annie's sweet 16.

775
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,730
Annie, I know this isn't the ordinary birthday dedication,

776
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,690
But you're no ordinary girl.

777
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,530
That's why I love you.

778
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,790
Oh, my god, she is so amazing.

779
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,960
Oh, I know, right?

780
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,460
She's totally rocking it.

781
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,390
Annie, I told you we should have gone first.

782
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,630
Now we're going to get a vocal beat-down by grandma wilson.

783
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,090
Let's go find a song.

784
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,590
We'll be back. we're gonna go make out.

785
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,490
Darling.

786
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:43,460
Karaoke... a surprising smash, kansas.

787
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,290
So where's ethan?

788
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,630
He must be running late, I guess.

789
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,830
You should call him.

790
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,590
No. um, don't worry about it.

791
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,390
Gee, you'd think he'd be here.

792
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,890
Okay, where is ethan, anyway?

793
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,630
Um, he might not be coming.

794
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,490
We got in a bit of a fight.

795
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,190
But it's your birthday.

796
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,690
Yeah, I know.

797
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,060
I'm gonna go get some air.

798
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,830
Don't you have a party inside?

799
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,860
I'm not really in the partying mood.

800
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:26,560
Listen, I'm...

801
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,230
Really sorry, annie.

802
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,230
You were nothing but honest with me about that kiss,

803
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,830
And... I was a jerk.

804
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:38,860
I would have gone with jackass, but okay.

805
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,230
The truth is,

806
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,960
I had no right to get mad at you

807
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,790
When I was the one who got us into this whole mess

808
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,730
By saying that we should keep naomi in the dark.

809
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,790
Yeah, well, you didn't do it alone.

810
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,690
I tried to tell her a bunch of times and just totally

811
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:57,360
Chickened out.

812
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,730
And I guess I didn't have to hook up with you

813
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,730
The minute you were

814
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,890
On the rebound.

815
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,390
That's true.

816
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,690
But I am glad you did.

817
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,490
Ethan...

818
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:12,090
There is going to be a cake soon,

819
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,960
And on it, there will be 16 candles

820
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:15,660
For me to blow out.

821
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:21,190
And my only wish is to be with you without all these secrets.

822
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:24,160
That's what I want, too.

823
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,560
Jason told dixon he's going to leave

824
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,530
On the red-eye tonight back to kansas city.

825
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,190
So I kind of wanted

826
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,990
To tell him the truth before he's gone.

827
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,460
And naomi, too.

828
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,560
Okay.

829
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,960
Oh... happy birthday.

830
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,490
Is it the pentapus?

831
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,860
So much for the element of surprise.

832
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:49,060
Well, you know what, I'm kind of over surprises, so...

833
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,490
Well, then I should probably just tell you

834
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:53,260
That I'm about to kiss you.

835
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:09,660
Jason.

836
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,460
Naomi.

837
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,790
You have to see this.

838
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,090
Come here.

839
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,660
Wow.

840
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,460
She really has moved on.

841
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,430
Annie swore to me that they weren't together.

842
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,630
I can't believe she would lie like that.

843
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,730
I just... I can't believe...

844
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,860
I'm sorry.

845
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,660
Hey.

846
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:55,430
Looks like I caught you on your way out... of town.

847
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,130
What are, what are you doing here?

848
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,130
Harry called me.

849
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,860
So you know I'm not the devil.

850
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:04,260
I never thought that.

851
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:07,890
Are you sure? 'cause most people did.

852
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,630
So where are you headed?

853
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,360
Honestly, I don't know.

854
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:16,360
I'm just going to go to lax and let the fates decide.

855
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,530
Ryan, this will all blow over, you know that, right?

856
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,460
Your real story will be in the paper.

857
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:21,930
It'll be all over the news.

858
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,630
And you can go back to teaching.

859
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:27,890
I just need to get away, you know, take some time

860
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:28,990
And clear my head.

861
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,230
You know, get out of town

862
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,230
And figure out what I'm doing.

863
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,390
But thanks for stopping by.

864
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,830
It was good seeing you.

865
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,190
Ryan...

866
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:48,160
Maybe when you get back, we can get together.

867
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,860
Kimberly, hey.

868
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,790
Hey, kelly.

869
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:57,690
I can call you kelly, right?

870
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,860
Yeah, of course.

871
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,130
Am I interrupting something?

872
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,530
No, no.

873
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,760
I was just leaving.

874
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,930
Have a nice trip.

875
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,430
Thanks.

876
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,160
How you doing?

877
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,330
I'm good.

878
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,230
Do you think naomi's up here?

879
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,160
Jared saw her go upstairs.

880
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:33,090
Oh, my god.

881
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,360
I-i-i can't believe this.

882
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,490
How could you do this to me?

883
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:48,930
How could you do it to me is the question, annie.

884
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,160
I saw you making out with ethan at school.

885
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,490
What?

886
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,630
Wait, you-you knew they were together?

887
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,290
So, I just figured,

888
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:00,090
Hey, if my good friend annie, who I specifically asked

889
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,290
Not to date ethan,

890
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,290
Could make out with my ex,

891
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:07,030
What's stopping me from fooling around with hers?

892
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:09,860
Payback's a real bitch, isn't it?

893
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,760
An-annie, wait!

894
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:21,630
You pathetic bitch.

895
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:36,330
After this, my mother's going to do her big closing number.

896
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,290
I think we should pull the plug on karaoke

897
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:39,860
And get out the cake.

898
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,430
Oh, but the kids really seem to be enjoying her.

899
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,860
I mean, how bad could it be?

900
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:45,230
I think that it involves pasties.

901
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,990
I'll get the birthday girl. okay.

902
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,260
I'm sorry, but I saw you and ethan outside kissing,

903
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,330
And it just freaked me out a little bit.

904
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,930
I mean, you could have told me that you guys were together.

905
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,690
Why'd you hide that?

906
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:00,160
I... I didn't want to hurt you.

907
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,590
So instead you played naomi's game?

908
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,930
The girl that I knew

909
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,960
Back in kansas was above that.

910
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,730
You don't understand, okay?

911
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,230
The rules are different here.

912
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,390
But that doesn't mean

913
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,990
You have to be.

914
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,490
I got to get to the airport.

915
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,960
I'm sorry if I ruined your birthday.

916
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,260
All right, everybody.

917
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,890
Nicely done.

918
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,790
Time to sing to the birthday girl.

919
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,260
Sweetie, are you okay?

920
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:53,890
You... outside now!

921
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,790
Any requests?

922
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,990
Just so I am clear,

923
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,330
Everything you have done-- the whole shopping trip,

924
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,030
Flying jason out here, all of that

925
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,790
Was just to set me up to ruin my birthday?

926
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,130
Absolutely.

927
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,960
But if you want ethan, you can have him.

928
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,760
I wanted to see you miserable and I got my wish.

929
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,690
That's sick.

930
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:25,160
Oh, don't give me that holier-than-thou routine.

931
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,390
You're no innocent here.

932
00:40:26,392 --> 00:40:27,390
Okay, I should have told you about ethan.

933
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,960
I will grant you that.

934
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,990
-I wanted to tell you. -but you didn't, did you?!

935
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,990
No, instead you tried to play me for a fool,

936
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,190
You backstabbing, duplicitous bitch!

937
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,830
Okay, I was trying to spare your feelings!

938
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,360
I knew you would be upset,

939
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,860
And so I was trying to find the right time.

940
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,590
But you didn't even like jason.

941
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,230
You just went after him to hurt me.

942
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,230
You deserved it.

943
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,730
I am so sick

944
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,290
And tired of all you people

945
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,930
Who won't tell me the truth.

946
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,490
First it was my dad and his mistress,

947
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,030
And then my mother with her son...

948
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,390
None of that was my fault.

949
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,990
All I know

950
00:40:56,030 --> 00:41:01,060
Is that before you moved here, my life was perfectly fine!

951
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:04,460
No, before I moved here, you were just lying to yourself

952
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:05,830
And getting away with it.

953
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,390
You'd rather have people fear you

954
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:10,030
Then be honest with you.

955
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,830
You're manipulative and cruel

956
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,830
And the only person that you should be blaming

957
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,260
For feeling so alone right now is you.

958
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:21,090
That all you got, kansas?

959
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:23,830
Listen to me.

960
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,660
Being your friend-- I'm over it.

961
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,430
I already beat you to it.

962
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:31,090
Excuse me. sorry to bother you ladies.

963
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,590
Who are you? who are you?

964
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,030
My name's sean.

965
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,960
I'm the son of harry wilson and tracy clark.
