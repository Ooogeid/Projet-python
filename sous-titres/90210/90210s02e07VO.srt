1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:02,301
Previously on 90210...
It's about mom.

2
00:00:02,301 --> 00:00:04,334
What about her?
She's dying.

3
00:00:04,334 --> 00:00:07,401
What's best for Silver is
that you leave her alone.

4
00:00:07,401 --> 00:00:08,434
I'd like to move in with you.

5
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:11,500
My kids are juniors in high school.

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,867
I actually have pictures.

7
00:00:12,867 --> 00:00:14,234
This is my son Dixon.

8
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:15,633
College is a big decision.

9
00:00:15,633 --> 00:00:17,667
I will be going to California University.

10
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:19,401
CU isn't going to happen.

11
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:20,667
You're going to focus on the SATs?

12
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:22,567
Yeah, no. I'm going to
date the dean's son.

13
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:24,468
Are you Richard?
Naomi.

14
00:00:24,468 --> 00:00:25,800
I'm Jamie, by the way.

15
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,900
Hey. There you are.

16
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,001
Jamie, this is...

17
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:30,001
My roommate, Richard.

18
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:31,067
I actually thought you had a crush

19
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:32,468
on my husband.

20
00:00:32,468 --> 00:00:33,800
What?

21
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,167
Knock yourself out.

22
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:36,468
Oh, perfect.
Thank you, Kelly.

23
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:33,234
Oh, what the hell?

24
00:01:33,234 --> 00:01:35,167
I know. Right?

25
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:38,468
Dude, this blows. I just snapped a fin.

26
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:39,500
Who cares about your fin?

27
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,800
I got a big dent in my car.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,734
Relax, man. It's just a dent.

29
00:01:42,734 --> 00:01:43,734
A big dent.

30
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:46,600
What, like $500 tops?

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,834
You want some cash? I'm
totally cool to split it.

32
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:50,401
I don't want your money.

33
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,533
Okay...

34
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:54,101
So, what do you want?

35
00:01:54,101 --> 00:01:55,934
Uh, an apology.

36
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:58,167
You hit me. I saw you
backing out and I stopped.

37
00:01:58,167 --> 00:01:59,900
Well, then this would
be your fault, too. No?

38
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,600
Why are you stopping in the
middle of the parking lot?

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,334
Are you seriously blaming me?

40
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:05,167
Well, clearly, I didn't see you.

41
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,767
Well, maybe that's because
you're a little girl

42
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:09,267
who's driving a car that's
clearly too big for you.

43
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:11,900
Right.

44
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,101
You know what, dude? Maybe
I do owe you an apology.

45
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:19,334
I am so sorry that you
are such a sexist ass.

46
00:02:19,334 --> 00:02:20,700
You know, screw you!

47
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,134
Oh, right back at you, loser.

48
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,967
All right, so for today's main attraction,

49
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:37,401
you want to go Journey Earth
Jungles or Caves?

50
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:39,600
Uh, which one's shorter?

51
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,734
More time for our post-film discussion.

52
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:46,034
I like the way you think, babe.

53
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:48,468
Let's go Caves. There's supposed
to be some sick shots

54
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,134
of hydrogen-eating bacteria.

55
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:55,167
So, does your mom love the
environment as much as you do?

56
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:56,734
My mom? Yeah, right.

57
00:02:56,734 --> 00:02:58,101
Been trying to get the admissions office

58
00:02:58,101 --> 00:02:59,434
to go paperless forever.

59
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:01,167
Well, maybe we should double-team her.

60
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:04,167
Try to convince her to go green together.

61
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:07,234
Reduce, reuse, recycle.

62
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:08,734
Hey, guys.

63
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:09,800
Hey, Jamie.

64
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:13,001
So...

65
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:14,500
I, uh, calculated the electric bill.

66
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,001
Looks like you're responsible for about 2/3.

67
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:19,567
Not a problem. What do I owe you?

68
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:21,900
It's not what you owe me, man.
It's what you owe the planet.

69
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,301
Just need a dollar amount, Richard.

70
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:26,533
All right, I'm going to hop in the shower.

71
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:28,700
The Pi Phi Crush Party
starts in about an hour.

72
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,034
Do you guys want to come?

73
00:03:30,034 --> 00:03:32,034
Oh, no. We're good, thanks.

74
00:03:32,034 --> 00:03:34,667
Yeah, watching people drink
out of red plastic cups

75
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:36,867
just kind of makes me want to barf.

76
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:38,368
Mmm.

77
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:41,700
How oblivious is that guy?

78
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,034
He takes, like, two showers a day.

79
00:03:44,034 --> 00:03:45,101
Doesn't he know we live in a desert?

80
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:46,368
Duh.

81
00:03:46,368 --> 00:03:48,533
People who shower a lot are so gross.

82
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:50,101
God, you're great.

83
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:55,334
So, what do you think?
Should we double-team your mom?

84
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:58,101
Try to get the admissions
office to go green?

85
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:02,468
Unfortunately, I don't think that'll work.

86
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:04,468
The earth is full of secrets.

87
00:04:04,468 --> 00:04:06,234
Be prepared to unlock them

88
00:04:06,234 --> 00:04:10,468
as we travel deep within our glorious planet.

89
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:13,468
Join us on Journey Earth.

90
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:18,301
Uh, we could do Chinese.

91
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:21,301
Again.
Or Thai.

92
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:23,667
I think three times a week is my Thai limit.

93
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:27,067
And chance you might want to...

94
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,900
Ooh, we cannot go out, Dixon.

95
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,834
People could see me.
I could get in real trouble.

96
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:33,567
We could just say that we're friends.

97
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,767
Come on. This whole relationship

98
00:04:35,767 --> 00:04:37,368
can't take place in your apartment.

99
00:04:37,368 --> 00:04:39,267
Uh, well, I would go to your place,

100
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:41,267
but you live with your parents.

101
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:45,067
Hmm. And I am not sneaking in
the window Katie Holmes style.

102
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:48,667
Dawson's Creek.

103
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:51,101
Forget it. You were too young.

104
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:53,667
Look, baby, just pick a place.

105
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:54,867
I'm going to get changed for work.

106
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:06,101
Morning.

107
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:08,134
Morning.

108
00:05:08,134 --> 00:05:11,301
You were working late last night, huh?

109
00:05:11,301 --> 00:05:13,401
Again.

110
00:05:13,401 --> 00:05:16,567
Kelly wasn't there, if that's
what you're getting at.

111
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:19,533
But Mr. Wong looked
very sexy in his lab coat.

112
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:21,533
Don't do that. Don't joke about it.

113
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:23,900
Honey, I apologize for calling you Kelly,

114
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,434
but that happened two days ago

115
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:26,700
and it was an honest mistake.

116
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,267
I mean, come on, do you really think

117
00:05:28,267 --> 00:05:29,800
that something is going on between us?

118
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,800
What am I supposed to think?

119
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,633
You and I have been fighting lately.

120
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,134
We're on completely different pages with the kids.

121
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:38,734
I got a vibe a couple of months
ago that she liked you.

122
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:40,334
And now you're calling me by her name.

123
00:05:40,334 --> 00:05:43,301
Yeah, you got that vibe after we
accidentally ate pot brownies.

124
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,167
Being high doesn't mean
you can't see the truth.

125
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:48,167
There are plenty of very savvy
pot smokers out there.

126
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:49,767
You want to take that anti-drug message

127
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,267
up to the kids, or should I?

128
00:05:54,234 --> 00:05:58,500
Look, I am genuinely sorry for the slip-up.

129
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,301
And I understand why it upset you.

130
00:06:00,301 --> 00:06:02,001
The only reason that I called you Kelly

131
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:04,500
is because I had work on my mind.

132
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,734
That's all.

133
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:07,834
Look, and you're right.

134
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,001
Hey.

135
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:12,800
Things have been stressful
around here lately.

136
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,934
With Annie and the move and...

137
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:17,201
We've got to start
making time for each other.

138
00:06:17,201 --> 00:06:18,368
Hmm?

139
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:21,700
So, why don't you come
by the school tomorrow?

140
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,834
And we'll have lunch.

141
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,834
Okay?

142
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:29,201
Yeah.

143
00:06:29,201 --> 00:06:30,867
Okay.

144
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:36,934
What do you mean, you don't
have the prescription?

145
00:06:36,934 --> 00:06:39,267
My mom's out of pills and she's in a lot of pain.

146
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:43,301
Look, I don't care how you get
them, you just have to get them!

147
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:44,800
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm just really frustrated.

148
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,633
I called this in yesterday and you guys...

149
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:51,401
Yeah. Yeah, fine.
I... I'll try back later.

150
00:06:53,034 --> 00:06:54,900
Hey.
Hi.

151
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,301
How are you holding up?

152
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:58,533
I'm fine.
You don't look fine. You look tired.

153
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:00,667
Well, that's because there's a lot to do.

154
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,567
In case you forgot, our mom has cancer.

155
00:07:04,034 --> 00:07:05,468
I didn't forget.

156
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:07,900
And by the way, you don't have
to live with her

157
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,667
to prove to me that you can.

158
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:13,533
Look, that might be why I went there.

159
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,700
But it's not why I'm staying.

160
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,567
You can't be happy.

161
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:18,800
It's not about me being happy.

162
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,167
It's about the fact that she's dying.

163
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:23,101
Okay, but you're not her nurse.

164
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:25,234
Yeah. You're right.

165
00:07:25,234 --> 00:07:26,734
I'm her daughter.

166
00:07:26,734 --> 00:07:28,267
At least one of us is acting like it.

167
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:35,900
Left Dixon a message.

168
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,401
No answer.

169
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:39,368
It's the second practice
he's missed, man.

170
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:40,934
Coach is gonna be pissed.

171
00:07:40,934 --> 00:07:43,234
Ha... Gnarly pissed.

172
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:53,967
Damn.

173
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:57,600
Check him out.

174
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,067
Whoa-ho-ho-ho...

175
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:00,867
Gnarly, huh?

176
00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:03,700
You're looking at the winner of last year's

177
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,800
Amateur 16 and Under O.P. Pro.

178
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,468
And the newest member
to West Bev's Surf Team.

179
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:11,368
Wait. Are you serious?

180
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:12,533
Wow.

181
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,967
That dude is gonna give us

182
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:16,134
a serious leg up on the competition.

183
00:08:16,134 --> 00:08:18,301
Uh, yeah, that's not a dude, buddy.

184
00:08:18,301 --> 00:08:21,267
Ivy! Come here!

185
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:25,267
She's on the team?

186
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:30,667
You have got to be kidding me.

187
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:34,667

188
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,734
And I want you to prepare
a timeline detailing every...

189
00:08:51,734 --> 00:08:53,334
Sorry. I was at a doctor's appointment.

190
00:08:53,334 --> 00:08:54,600
Just take a seat.

191
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,334
Your timelines should include everything

192
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:59,167
that you deem relevant
to the Civil Rights Movement.

193
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:01,167
All right, this row...

194
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:02,600
Turn to your right.

195
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,167
That's your partner for the assignment.

196
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:07,101
This row, turn to your right.

197
00:09:07,101 --> 00:09:09,101
That's your partner for the assignment.

198
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:15,368
So...

199
00:09:15,368 --> 00:09:16,667
your place or mine?

200
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:18,134
How about I just do the assignment

201
00:09:18,134 --> 00:09:19,500
and put your name on it?

202
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,633
Gosh. If I didn't know better,

203
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:23,201
I'd think you didn't like me.

204
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:25,468
I don't.

205
00:09:25,468 --> 00:09:27,633
You're pompous and arrogant

206
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,167
and you totally screwed with Adrianna.

207
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,533
No, I didn't.

208
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:35,001
We just wanted different things.

209
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:36,167
Whatever.

210
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,934
You know, after we got
off the phone last night,

211
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:47,700
I could not stop thinking about you.

212
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,067
Me, neither.

213
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:51,567
Well, it was 4:00 a.m., so
I fell asleep pretty quickly,

214
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:52,734
but until then...

215
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:54,234
See, I couldn't even sleep.

216
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:00,234
You've got my neurons
firing on all cylinders, Annie.

217
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:03,067
I was so juiced, I, uh...

218
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:04,567
started working on my screenplay.

219
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:06,401
I thought you had writer's block.

220
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:09,368
I did, because I couldn't figure
out who the heroine was.

221
00:10:09,368 --> 00:10:13,234
But last night, it hit me.

222
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:15,667
She's you.

223
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:17,900
You're my muse, babe.

224
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:21,567
How would you feel
about being in my movie?

225
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,401
I'd love to.

226
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,900
Hey, Coach.

227
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,368
Hey.

228
00:10:32,368 --> 00:10:33,934
Look, I'm sorry I missed yesterday.

229
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,600
Second time in a week,
man. You're off the team.

230
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,101
What?!

231
00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:38,267
You're obviously not committed.

232
00:10:38,267 --> 00:10:39,434
No. No, I am!

233
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:41,600
Look, I just had a... a family emergency.

234
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,434
It won't happen again.
Please.

235
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:45,867
Just... just give me one more chance, man.

236
00:10:45,867 --> 00:10:47,734
This team means so much to me.

237
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:49,867
Please.

238
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,567
IVY: Anyways, so then we find
out that my house in Malibu

239
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,101
burnt down 'cause of those...
those brush fires.

240
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:56,301
Your house burned down?
Yeah.

241
00:10:56,301 --> 00:10:57,800
No way!
Yeah, and get this.

242
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,967
We don't even find out for,
like, another three days.

243
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,134
We were hanging out with, like,
Ray LaMontagne and Ben Harper,

244
00:11:02,134 --> 00:11:05,301
and Ben was, like, "Dude,
I think your house burnt down."

245
00:11:05,301 --> 00:11:07,301
And I was, like, "Dude, who cares?

246
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:09,734
It's just a house."

247
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:11,734
Excuse me?

248
00:11:11,734 --> 00:11:13,767
Okay, guys,

249
00:11:13,767 --> 00:11:15,934
gather up!

250
00:11:15,934 --> 00:11:18,900
How'd it go?

251
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,967
Well, um, I'm on probation,
but I'm still on the team.

252
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:23,967
Man, I was sweating

253
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:26,067
back there.

254
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:27,600
So, the antes

255
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,134
just went up for tomorrow.

256
00:11:29,134 --> 00:11:32,267
Billabong has donated a limited-edition

257
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:34,667
handmade board, which
is gonna go to the rider

258
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,334
with the highest all-around score.

259
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:38,633
Shut... up!
Pretty gnarly, huh?

260
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:41,101
So let's get in the water,
let's make this practice count!

261
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:43,334
Okay? Let's go!

262
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:48,134
Man, you know, I could really use
that board, since some douche bag

263
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:50,967
damaged mine.
You know it was

264
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:52,001
your fault.

265
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:53,667
Why don't you just apologize?

266
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:56,167
I am happy to, once
you apologize for
being a sexist pig.

267
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:58,967
You're out of your mind.

268
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:01,800
Oh, my God...

269
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,368
you're right.

270
00:12:03,368 --> 00:12:05,468
I've totally been acting crazy, huh?

271
00:12:05,468 --> 00:12:07,800
Sorry.

272
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,101
It's just, um...

273
00:12:10,101 --> 00:12:12,633
I'm on my... my period, you know?

274
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:17,201
Oh. Um... yeah.

275
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:19,167
Yeah, no... problem.

276
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:24,600
Wow.

277
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,667
You actually bought that.

278
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:30,134
Dude, you are worse
than I thought you were.

279
00:12:30,134 --> 00:12:32,368
Laters.

280
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,167
Uh-oh.

281
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,633
Oh.

282
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:51,201
What would Richard think about this?

283
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:52,401
What was I thinking?

284
00:12:52,401 --> 00:12:54,001
I cannot believe I did that.

285
00:12:54,001 --> 00:12:55,633
Okay, Naomi,

286
00:12:55,633 --> 00:12:57,867
come on, what are you... what
are you doing with Richard?

287
00:12:57,867 --> 00:13:00,234
Hmm?

288
00:13:00,234 --> 00:13:02,734
I mean, he's so...

289
00:13:02,734 --> 00:13:04,734
not your type.

290
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:07,934
I... he's nice.

291
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:10,267
We're getting to know each other.

292
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:11,934
Mm. Okay.

293
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:14,867
Let me walk you to your car.

294
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:20,600
So, I'm sitting here
with my grandfather
at a football game,

295
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,734
and I must've been, like, six or seven,

296
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:26,700
and the first thing I'm thinking
is, "Ew, maroon and black?

297
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,334
I hate those colors together."

298
00:13:28,334 --> 00:13:30,101
But then the cheerleaders came out

299
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,767
and the marching band did their thing, and...

300
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:34,434
everyone was just yelling and screaming.

301
00:13:34,434 --> 00:13:38,067
They were so into it... by
the end of the day, I was, like,

302
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:42,368
"You know, Grandpa, maroon and
black aren't so bad after all."

303
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:45,234
Oh, that's when I knew
I was smitten with CU.

304
00:13:45,234 --> 00:13:47,900
Mm. You know, it's funny,
I remember the first time

305
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,967
that I realized that I didn't
mind the school colors.

306
00:13:50,967 --> 00:13:52,301
When?

307
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:53,468
Oh, uh,

308
00:13:53,468 --> 00:13:54,934
you were kidding.
Yeah, I'm kidding.

309
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,301
Maybe a little.

310
00:13:57,301 --> 00:13:59,800
So, are you and your grandfather close?

311
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,267
We were, yeah.

312
00:14:01,267 --> 00:14:04,301
He-he passed away five years ago, so...

313
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,800
I'm sorry.

314
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,800
Yeah, it sucked.

315
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,301
We always had a really
special connection.

316
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:13,533
I was kind of his favorite.

317
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:15,633
Well, I'm...

318
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:18,434
I'm sure you're lots of people's favorite.

319
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:28,500
Man, I wish...

320
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,167
I wish you weren't dating Richard,

321
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:32,600
because I... I really want to kiss you.

322
00:14:38,101 --> 00:14:41,167
But you are, so I... I won't.

323
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:47,967
We should get going.

324
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,834
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

325
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:03,534
So, uh...

326
00:15:03,534 --> 00:15:05,534
do you need a ride to school?

327
00:15:05,534 --> 00:15:08,033
Nope. I have a ride.

328
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,234
With that guy you been hanging out with?

329
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:13,067
Um, Jasper... is that his name?

330
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:14,868
Yeah. Why?

331
00:15:14,868 --> 00:15:18,167
I don't know, he just... seems
a little sketchy, that's all.

332
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,501
Do you even know him?

333
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,200
No, but...

334
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,834
He doesn't hang out with
the West Beverly kids

335
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:26,234
because they're all
judgmental lemmings...

336
00:15:26,234 --> 00:15:28,434
like you.
Annie, like...

337
00:15:28,434 --> 00:15:30,067
No, it's true.

338
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:31,834
And-And who are you to be
calling someone sketchy?

339
00:15:31,834 --> 00:15:33,601
If anyone's sketchy around here, it's you.

340
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:36,200
What's that supposed to mean?

341
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,501
It means you've been sneaking
out of the house at night,

342
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:40,401
going who knows where,
lying to Mom and Dad.

343
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:42,900
And where have you been going?

344
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:47,601
Exactly. Sketchy, like I said.

345
00:15:50,267 --> 00:15:51,534
Oh, it's so unfair, okay?

346
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,033
Jamie is, like, the perfect guy,

347
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:54,734
and I'm stuck with smelly,
shower-hating Richard.

348
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:57,667
You're not stuck with him... you
can always end your fake relationship.

349
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:59,267
And not get into CU? Yeah, no.

350
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:02,567
Come on, it's not like Richard has
even invited you to meet his mom.

351
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:04,134
Oh, no, he did... he called me this morning.

352
00:16:04,134 --> 00:16:05,434
She's throwing some kind of cocktail party.

353
00:16:05,434 --> 00:16:06,734
Ostensibly, we're gonna stop her

354
00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:08,234
from ung paper napkins, but still...

355
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:09,734
Wow.
Yeah.

356
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:12,134
So I have to put Jamie out
of my mind, completely,

357
00:16:12,134 --> 00:16:14,300
end of story, because look
what happened to you.

358
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,200
You went after some shiny pretty
boy and got stuck with nothing.

359
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,401
I can't do that. Thanks for that.
Thank you.

360
00:16:19,401 --> 00:16:21,534
I just mean, I can't let myself get distracted

361
00:16:21,534 --> 00:16:25,267
by rock-hard abs and thighs
that have driven countries to war.

362
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:29,200
Okay, what country has ever
been driven to war over thighs?

363
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,401
Look, I'm sorry that the
agency double-booked you,

364
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:34,134
but I really... I have to have a nurse tonight.

365
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:36,667
Last night it was just me, and I can't...

366
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,334
Shoot. Um, I have to go, okay?

367
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:40,267
But I'm gonna call you back after class.

368
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:42,601
Just please, try to make it work. Thanks.

369
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:48,000
All right, everyone,

370
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,734
I'll collect your projects now.

371
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:51,734
Thank you.

372
00:16:51,734 --> 00:16:53,601
Thank you.

373
00:16:54,634 --> 00:16:55,933
Um...

374
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,734
I... I actu...

375
00:16:57,734 --> 00:16:59,267
uh, I forgot it.

376
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:00,267
I... it's okay.

377
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:02,334
You don't have to cover for me.

378
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:04,334
We worked at my house last night,

379
00:17:04,334 --> 00:17:06,300
and I forgot the project at home.

380
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,701
Silver even called to remind me, but I just flaked.

381
00:17:08,701 --> 00:17:11,501
Sorry.

382
00:17:11,501 --> 00:17:13,534
Bring it in tomorrow.

383
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:15,334
Teddy, you'll be penalized

384
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:16,967
a whole grade.

385
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:22,267
See?

386
00:17:22,267 --> 00:17:24,434
Told you I wasn't a bad guy.

387
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:26,300
No one asked you to do that.

388
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:34,634
Come in.

389
00:17:34,634 --> 00:17:35,768
Hi.

390
00:17:35,768 --> 00:17:37,801
Uh, hang on one sec.

391
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:43,367
Now, I assume that you are here

392
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:45,701
to talk to the President about
health care reform.

393
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:48,701
Senior evals, actually.

394
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,801
Oh, well, you've come up with any new

395
00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:54,334
and exciting ways to trick colleges
into accepting our slackers?

396
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:55,967
You okay?

397
00:17:57,734 --> 00:18:00,300
Kelly, what's going on?

398
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,000
It's... it's Silver.

399
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,200
She okay?

400
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,967
Yeah. No.

401
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:07,000
I don't know.

402
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,667
She moved out.

403
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:11,667
Our mom has cancer,
and she moved out.

404
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:12,967
What?

405
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:16,000
I can't really talk about it right now.

406
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,734
I have to get to a meeting.

407
00:18:17,734 --> 00:18:20,100
Um, maybe we could grab...

408
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,234
lunch later.

409
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,868
I could use somebody to talk to.

410
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,401
Yeah, of course.

411
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:26,501
Okay. Thanks.

412
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,267
Hey, hon.

413
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:42,667
Hey. What's up?
Um, bad news.

414
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:44,933
I'm swamped here.

415
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:47,033
Could we reschedule our lunch?

416
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:48,734
Sure. No problem.

417
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,234
Maybe we can go as the Rat Pack.

418
00:18:52,234 --> 00:18:56,701
Right. Like you're even gonna show.

419
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:57,933
You've been ditching everything lately.

420
00:18:57,933 --> 00:19:00,401
I'll be there, all right?

421
00:19:00,401 --> 00:19:03,367
I was thinking maybe I could be Sinatra.

422
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:05,868
And Liam could be Sammy Davis Jr.

423
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,933
Yeah, I don't... really do Halloween.

424
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:11,634
That's lame, man.

425
00:19:13,701 --> 00:19:15,534
Think Navid'll come?
Nah. I don't think

426
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:17,067
he wants to run into Ade.

427
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:20,067
Hold on, hold on.

428
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:22,234
Uh... got to take this.

429
00:19:22,234 --> 00:19:23,834
Come on, man.

430
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:27,100
Hello?

431
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,100
Hey, baby. So, um,

432
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,634
I got a gig tonight that's
gonna go late, so I was thinking

433
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:33,100
that you could come by after school.

434
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,100
Uh, I... I can't; I have a surf meet later on today.

435
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,501
Okay, well, just come by after that.

436
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:38,667
I don't leave until 9:00.

437
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:41,768
Um...

438
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:44,834
You see, there...

439
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:46,834
there's this Halloween party that...

440
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:48,601
I kind of wanted to hit.

441
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:50,634
You'd rather go to a high school Halloween party

442
00:19:50,634 --> 00:19:51,768
than be with me?

443
00:19:51,768 --> 00:19:53,134
No. No. Uh...

444
00:19:53,134 --> 00:19:54,434
you know, it's just that

445
00:19:54,434 --> 00:19:56,300
I haven't really been able to hang out

446
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,868
with my friends lately,
and I don't want to ditch them.

447
00:19:58,868 --> 00:20:01,367
Come on, baby, you hang out
with your friends every day,

448
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,000
while I hardly ever get to see you.

449
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:06,100
Oh. You know what? Shoot.
This is call-waiting.

450
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,868
Look, I'll... I'll see you at 6:00, okay?

451
00:20:07,868 --> 00:20:09,534
Bye.

452
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,501
I know she's dying,

453
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:16,033
but that doesn't erase
all the damage she's done.

454
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:18,467
I'm just trying to look out for my sister.

455
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,701
Of course you are.

456
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:22,634
Oh, you should see the way
Silver looks at me, though.

457
00:20:22,634 --> 00:20:25,534
Like I am a horrible person.

458
00:20:28,534 --> 00:20:30,868
Uh... I thought you might

459
00:20:30,868 --> 00:20:32,334
be hungry, but I see

460
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:35,567
that you... made time for lunch, after all.

461
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:39,634
Excuse me.

462
00:20:41,467 --> 00:20:43,667
Hey.

463
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:45,667
Deb, wait.
No.

464
00:20:45,668 --> 00:20:47,668
I will not have this conversation here.

465
00:20:55,068 --> 00:20:55,801
And welcome

466
00:20:55,801 --> 00:20:59,967
to the 33rd annual
L.A. County Surf Invitational.

467
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:00,734
This year we have

468
00:21:00,734 --> 00:21:02,400
West Beverly and Sunset Hills

469
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,534
taking on the top-ranked
Malibu Canyon High School.

470
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:08,967
All right, guys, listen up, listen up.

471
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:11,900
So, uh, Teddy, Paul and
Padma are in heat one.

472
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,001
Liam and Ivy are in heat two.

473
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:15,201
Ben and David, heat three.

474
00:21:15,201 --> 00:21:18,268
And Robbie, Michael and Kyle are last,

475
00:21:18,268 --> 00:21:20,201
and Dixon's sitting out.

476
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:21,734
Okay, so the top two in each heat

477
00:21:21,734 --> 00:21:23,367
is gonna move on to the semifinals.

478
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:24,400
The top two

479
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,034
in the semis is gonna move on

480
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,734
to the finals, and the winner,

481
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:31,567
well, I'm sure I don't have to
remind you guys what's at stake.

482
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,500
Let's have a gnarly meet, okay?

483
00:21:38,168 --> 00:21:41,134
And the first team
is heading into the water.

484
00:21:48,868 --> 00:21:52,067
Sunset Hills and Malibu Canyon
go for this early wave.

485
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:55,500
That's West Beverly's Kenny Montgomery.

486
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:08,201
Oh, a vicious wipeout by Sunset Hills.

487
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,067
Worried about being schooled by a girl?

488
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:17,268
Just promise me you won't cry
when I kick your ass.

489
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,801
And that's West Bev's Liam
Court up on five feeter surf.

490
00:22:36,801 --> 00:22:38,634
That's Ivy Sullivan with a great ride.

491
00:22:44,001 --> 00:22:45,400
And that's Liam Court

492
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,801
cutting off his own teammate Ivy Sullivan.

493
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,634
Which brings us to the end
of the second heat.

494
00:22:54,001 --> 00:22:55,567
Yo, what the hell was that?

495
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:57,067
You totally cut me off, dude.

496
00:22:57,067 --> 00:22:58,534
I was on the inside, I had the right of way.

497
00:22:58,534 --> 00:22:59,967
Sorry. I didn't see you.

498
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:01,333
I get it.

499
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:03,901
Sort of like how I didn't see
you in the parking lot.

500
00:23:03,901 --> 00:23:05,634
Very funny. That's not what I meant.

501
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,801
Right.

502
00:23:10,734 --> 00:23:12,367
Hey, there you are.

503
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:13,767
Oh, listen, we're taking off.

504
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,101
We were going to see if
you were going to come by

505
00:23:16,101 --> 00:23:17,500
the Halloween party later.
I can't.

506
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,700
I have to finish this assignment.

507
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:22,367
What?

508
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,901
Ade and I were talking, and...

509
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:25,400
Okay, why do you have that,

510
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,367
"you might not like this," tone in your voice?

511
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:29,001
Because you might not like this,

512
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:30,268
but we need to say it.

513
00:23:31,433 --> 00:23:33,567
Say it.

514
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:36,268
Um... okay, we just, uh,

515
00:23:36,268 --> 00:23:39,234
we think maybe you've bitten
off more than you can chew.

516
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:41,901
You know, with your mom.
I've got everything
under control.

517
00:23:41,901 --> 00:23:43,767
We know, but...
See, there are no buts.

518
00:23:43,767 --> 00:23:46,067
I have no choice here. She's my mom.

519
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:47,934
Why can't anybody understand that?

520
00:23:47,934 --> 00:23:51,034
I'm sorry. I can't sit
here and talk about this.

521
00:23:51,034 --> 00:23:52,634
I have too much work to do.

522
00:23:52,634 --> 00:23:54,367
Have fun at the party.

523
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:56,734
Bye.

524
00:24:04,934 --> 00:24:06,734
All right, we're in the final round,

525
00:24:06,734 --> 00:24:09,934
and clearly West Bev has
the competitive edge today.

526
00:24:09,934 --> 00:24:12,767
Our last two surfers are both Wildcats.

527
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:14,734
Liam Court and Ivy Sullivan.
Ow!

528
00:24:14,734 --> 00:24:17,533
Dude, ow, ow, ow, ow.

529
00:24:17,533 --> 00:24:18,667
Ow!

530
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:21,001
Ow!
You okay?

531
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,434
No, I'm cramping up.

532
00:24:22,434 --> 00:24:24,867
Here, let me give you a hand.

533
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:27,433
Sucker.

534
00:24:32,834 --> 00:24:36,167
And time's up, as Ivy Sullivan
catches the final break.

535
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:02,734
Baby, I thought you weren't going to show.

536
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:03,834
Come on in.

537
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:07,900
Sasha, um... wait.

538
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,201
I'm actually not staying.

539
00:25:10,201 --> 00:25:12,301
Why not?

540
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:16,834
Because this relationship just isn't working.

541
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:20,368
What do you mean?

542
00:25:20,368 --> 00:25:23,667
I mean, we can't go
anywhere or do anything.

543
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:25,600
Wh... what do you expect?
You're in high school.

544
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,201
But that doesn't change the fact

545
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:29,700
that I want to be able to go out
with the girl that I'm dating.

546
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,267
I want to be able to introduce her

547
00:25:31,267 --> 00:25:33,201
to my friends. Let her be a part of my life.

548
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:34,767
You're just thinking about this now,

549
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:37,368
after you've roped me back in
and made me care?

550
00:25:37,368 --> 00:25:38,368
Look, I'm sorry.

551
00:25:38,368 --> 00:25:40,034
You're sorry?

552
00:25:40,034 --> 00:25:43,934
Sasha, I thought we would find
a way to make this work.

553
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:47,167
We haven't.

554
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:51,934
So, I think it's best that we just end things.

555
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:55,867
Sasha, I... I'm sorry...

556
00:25:55,867 --> 00:25:57,468
Get out of here.

557
00:25:58,969 --> 00:26:00,069
Get out of here.

558
00:26:14,534 --> 00:26:17,367
So you've been seeing her this whole time?

559
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,234
Man, I had no idea.

560
00:26:19,234 --> 00:26:22,800
Sasha wanted me to not tell anyone.

561
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,634
So I had to keep it on the down low.

562
00:26:25,634 --> 00:26:26,668
Now it's over.

563
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,334
Dude, I'm sorry.

564
00:26:29,334 --> 00:26:30,833
Hey, it's cool.

565
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:33,568
You know, uh, Sasha...
sh... she's a great girl,

566
00:26:33,568 --> 00:26:36,267
but we just... it couldn't work.

567
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,967
You a farmer?

568
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:42,767
What?

569
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:43,967
Your Halloween costume.

570
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:45,733
I'm not wearing a costume.

571
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:47,833
So let me ask you this.

572
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:49,234
When you say it's over with Sasha,

573
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:51,668
is it over, over, or just over
until you see her later

574
00:26:51,668 --> 00:26:53,501
for some hot make-up sex?

575
00:26:53,501 --> 00:26:55,668
No, no, no, it's... it's over, over.

576
00:26:55,668 --> 00:26:57,668
Absolutely over.

577
00:26:57,668 --> 00:26:58,967
You know, I'm officially back.

578
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:00,201
He's back.
Uh-huh.

579
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,367
He's back.
Yeah.

580
00:27:01,367 --> 00:27:03,700
So my friends and I couldn't decide.

581
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,434
Are you supposed to be, like,
Johnny Depp or a Jonas Brother?

582
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:09,501
Uh, he's a farmer.

583
00:27:09,501 --> 00:27:11,201
I'm not a farmer.
Farmhand.

584
00:27:11,201 --> 00:27:13,534
Worker on a farm. Whatever, man.

585
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:17,534
I'm just saying, I wouldn't
have come in costume

586
00:27:17,534 --> 00:27:18,668
if I knew you weren't.

587
00:27:18,668 --> 00:27:20,301
I'm in costume.

588
00:27:20,301 --> 00:27:21,833
I'm a future C.U. sorority girl.

589
00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:24,767
Have you heard from Silver?

590
00:27:24,767 --> 00:27:26,201
Is she going to come?

591
00:27:26,201 --> 00:27:28,501
No, she's still at school
finishing that project.

592
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:29,668
I feel bad.

593
00:27:29,668 --> 00:27:30,833
Do you think we overstepped?

594
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:32,867
Yeah, maybe a little.

595
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:35,134
It came from a good place. It was just...

596
00:27:35,134 --> 00:27:37,634
it was hard to know how
to act or what to say.

597
00:27:37,634 --> 00:27:39,401
I mean, I've never had a friend

598
00:27:39,401 --> 00:27:41,568
whose mother was dying of cancer.

599
00:27:41,568 --> 00:27:43,833
What?

600
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,568
Silver's mom has cancer?

601
00:27:47,568 --> 00:27:48,568
Um...

602
00:27:48,568 --> 00:27:49,634
I'm gonna go get some food.

603
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:50,700
I'll be back when he's gone.

604
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:55,501
Well, does she?

605
00:27:57,534 --> 00:27:58,967
You're Rob Pattinson, right?

606
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:01,234
I could tell 'cause of your messy hair.

607
00:28:01,234 --> 00:28:03,034
I'm not wearing a costume.

608
00:28:05,134 --> 00:28:07,201
Oh, after you.

609
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:11,501
What, you decided to come as a
gentleman for Halloween or something?

610
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:13,534
Ivy.

611
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:17,267
Sorry. I didn't realize it was you.

612
00:28:17,267 --> 00:28:19,201
By all means, cut to the front of the line,

613
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:20,767
since cheating is how you get ahead.

614
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:22,601
Okay, look, dude, the only
reason I said I had a cramp

615
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:24,167
was because you cut me off.

616
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:26,601
So let's just say I gave you
a taste of your own medicine.

617
00:28:26,601 --> 00:28:27,900
As long as you're comfortable knowing

618
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,267
you didn't deserve to win.

619
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:31,767
I can beat you anytime, anywhere, okay?

620
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:33,067
You want to bet?

621
00:28:33,067 --> 00:28:34,900
Game on.

622
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,401
This is a suicide competition,

623
00:28:36,401 --> 00:28:39,367
which means there is only one rule:

624
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:42,100
first one to wipe out loses.

625
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,634
And as for the loser...

626
00:28:43,634 --> 00:28:45,467
I will drink your blood.

627
00:28:47,601 --> 00:28:51,034
All right, catch some waves.

628
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:55,601
Let's go, boy.

629
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,134
Oh!

630
00:29:42,733 --> 00:29:44,467
Yeah!

631
00:29:47,934 --> 00:29:49,833
My boy!

632
00:29:58,167 --> 00:29:59,434
Okay, so...

633
00:29:59,434 --> 00:30:02,201
This is the surprise place
you wanted to take me?

634
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:04,267
The beach club?

635
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:05,534
We're here to shoot

636
00:30:05,534 --> 00:30:07,034
a scene from my movie.

637
00:30:07,034 --> 00:30:09,367
Are you serious?
Mm-hmm.

638
00:30:11,034 --> 00:30:13,201
It's scene 11.
Okay...

639
00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:14,967
The script.

640
00:30:14,967 --> 00:30:18,767
Your character... she's gonna go

641
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:22,900
and, uh, borrow a car, take it for a joyride.

642
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,700
I'm thinking this Bentley.

643
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,568
Um, and by borrow, do you mean steal?

644
00:30:30,568 --> 00:30:34,568
No, by borrow, I mean borrow.

645
00:30:34,568 --> 00:30:36,568
The valets... they always leave the keys

646
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,568
right on top of the tires.

647
00:30:38,568 --> 00:30:39,900
The party's just getting started,

648
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,700
so nobody's even going to know the difference.

649
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,234
I can't.

650
00:30:43,234 --> 00:30:45,401
Come on, Annie, live a little.

651
00:30:45,401 --> 00:30:47,034
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.

652
00:30:47,034 --> 00:30:49,700
I just... No.

653
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,234
This is just... it's what you got to do

654
00:30:52,234 --> 00:30:53,401
in low-budget filmmaking.

655
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:56,167
Look, don't you want to make this movie?

656
00:30:56,167 --> 00:30:58,767
Yes, yes, but...

657
00:30:58,767 --> 00:31:00,668
Remember, you're my muse, babe.

658
00:31:00,668 --> 00:31:04,100
I know. I know, but...

659
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,833
Maybe we could just ask the owners.

660
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:12,601
But then we have to go through
all this paperwork, licensing.

661
00:31:13,934 --> 00:31:16,501
I don't know, I mean, it's cool, I guess.

662
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:18,434
Let's just forget it.

663
00:31:18,434 --> 00:31:20,100
Jasper...

664
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,034
I just thought...

665
00:31:22,034 --> 00:31:23,601
Whatever, let's just go.

666
00:31:23,601 --> 00:31:25,601
Come on.

667
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:27,234
Jasper.

668
00:31:40,134 --> 00:31:41,967
Those aren't going to help.

669
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,934
I didn't think they would,
but I had to at least try.

670
00:31:44,934 --> 00:31:47,534
Look, I'm sorry I cancelled on you today.

671
00:31:47,534 --> 00:31:49,733
Kelly's mom has cancer.
She came into my office,

672
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:51,601
she started crying, she
wanted to have lunch...

673
00:31:51,601 --> 00:31:54,067
Stop. Just stop. You lied.

674
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:55,568
I omitted.

675
00:31:55,568 --> 00:31:57,867
Okay, I lied, but only because
you're so sensitive about Kelly.

676
00:31:57,867 --> 00:31:59,967
Because she has a crush on you.
You're wrong.

677
00:31:59,967 --> 00:32:02,000
I'm not. And you know what's even worse,

678
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,167
is you're playing into it.
Her mother is dying.

679
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:06,000
I know. I am sorry for that, I am,

680
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,134
but she should not be going
to her married boss

681
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,267
with her problems.
Deb...

682
00:32:09,267 --> 00:32:10,334
No, listen to me.

683
00:32:10,334 --> 00:32:11,434
She likes you.

684
00:32:11,434 --> 00:32:12,967
That's why she's confiding in you.

685
00:32:12,967 --> 00:32:15,501
And you need to stop beingo
obtuse and face what's going on.

686
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:17,067
I'm going to yoga.

687
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:19,134
I need to calm down.

688
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:32,833
Hey.

689
00:32:34,201 --> 00:32:36,700
What are you doing here?

690
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,867
Look, I know you don't like me,

691
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:42,367
but I heard about your mom.

692
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:44,367
I'm really sorry.
Save it.

693
00:32:44,367 --> 00:32:46,534
I don't need your pity.

694
00:32:46,534 --> 00:32:48,501
I'm not here to pity you.

695
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:49,867
We're not friends.
I know.

696
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:51,034
So why are you here?

697
00:32:51,034 --> 00:32:55,334
Because...

698
00:32:55,334 --> 00:32:57,301
My mom died three years ago.

699
00:32:58,534 --> 00:33:00,167
Thought you might

700
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:03,867
want to talk to someone who
knows what you're going through.

701
00:33:03,867 --> 00:33:07,134
But... I get it.

702
00:33:07,134 --> 00:33:08,401
You don't.

703
00:33:08,401 --> 00:33:10,334
Wait.

704
00:33:14,568 --> 00:33:19,334
I don't... don't want to talk.

705
00:33:19,334 --> 00:33:21,334
I mean...

706
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,534
I do.

707
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,684
So that's why you moved back East,

708
00:33:30,684 --> 00:33:31,884
to take care of your mom?

709
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,684
Yeah.

710
00:33:33,684 --> 00:33:37,317
It was like I was living this
weird double life, you know?

711
00:33:37,317 --> 00:33:38,417
When I was at school,

712
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:41,184
I thought about things like tests and parties.

713
00:33:41,184 --> 00:33:43,517
But... back home,

714
00:33:43,517 --> 00:33:46,350
it was all oxygen and nebulizers.

715
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:49,451
Yeah, I know what you mean.

716
00:33:49,451 --> 00:33:52,818
Everyone, my friends, my sister,

717
00:33:52,818 --> 00:33:55,551
they just, they just don't get it.

718
00:33:55,551 --> 00:33:58,384
I mean, they think that
I'm taking on too much.

719
00:33:58,384 --> 00:34:00,284
But... How could you live with yourself

720
00:34:00,284 --> 00:34:02,184
if you weren't there for her?

721
00:34:02,184 --> 00:34:03,684
Exactly.

722
00:34:03,684 --> 00:34:07,584
I don't, I don't know how long

723
00:34:07,584 --> 00:34:09,584
we have left.

724
00:34:11,684 --> 00:34:15,250
I keep trying to build some
sort of a relationship...

725
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,350
Trust me, I get it.

726
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:21,083
Doesn't mean it's not hard as hell.

727
00:34:23,217 --> 00:34:26,818
I... I've been working so hard
not to admit that, you know?

728
00:34:26,818 --> 00:34:28,050
I just,

729
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:29,717
I don't want everyone

730
00:34:29,717 --> 00:34:32,384
to jump down my throat and say "See?

731
00:34:32,384 --> 00:34:33,651
You can't handle it."

732
00:34:33,651 --> 00:34:35,551
You can handle it.

733
00:34:41,384 --> 00:34:46,083
It just gets so overwhelming, you know?

734
00:34:47,684 --> 00:34:51,284
Sometimes, I just...

735
00:34:51,284 --> 00:34:52,950
I just want to scream.

736
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,350
Come on.

737
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,184
Come on.

738
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:02,451
Um...

739
00:35:02,451 --> 00:35:05,083
I'm gonna show you
how I used to blow off steam.

740
00:35:13,818 --> 00:35:15,884
You won this, fair and square.

741
00:35:15,884 --> 00:35:18,217
Thanks.

742
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:19,484
Yep.

743
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:22,150
And, look, you're a really good surfer.

744
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,983
Thank you.
For a girl.

745
00:35:23,983 --> 00:35:25,617
Dude, what is your deal?

746
00:35:25,617 --> 00:35:26,617
It's like you really...

747
00:35:27,617 --> 00:35:29,083
You're kidding?

748
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,884
Right.

749
00:35:30,884 --> 00:35:32,250
Whatever, dude.

750
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,784
So I might be slightly sensitive
to gender stereotypes, okay?

751
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,284
Oh, slightly?

752
00:35:36,284 --> 00:35:38,651
Dude, growing up surfing,
I just had to prove myself

753
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:41,217
to the guys, over and over and over again.

754
00:35:41,217 --> 00:35:43,983
It was just, it was a pain
in the ass, you know?

755
00:35:43,983 --> 00:35:48,350
Just constantly being...
underestimated or whatever.

756
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,918
Whoa, wait.

757
00:35:49,918 --> 00:35:51,918
Just so we're clear, I never
underestimated you, okay?

758
00:35:51,918 --> 00:35:53,517
I know you're a great surfer.

759
00:35:53,517 --> 00:35:55,417
I also know you are

760
00:35:55,417 --> 00:35:57,250
lousy with apologies.

761
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,517
Great. Are we back to the car?

762
00:35:59,517 --> 00:36:00,451
We're back to the car.

763
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:02,117
Why is it so important to you

764
00:36:02,117 --> 00:36:03,584
that I apologize?

765
00:36:03,584 --> 00:36:06,250
Let's just say I've been
underestimated, too.

766
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,250
What, people assume you're a bad driver?

767
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,617
People assume I'm bad, period.

768
00:36:10,617 --> 00:36:12,517
So, when something's not my fault,

769
00:36:12,517 --> 00:36:14,517
I don't like to be blamed for it.

770
00:36:19,117 --> 00:36:22,017
I'm sorry I hit you.

771
00:36:22,017 --> 00:36:23,617
It was my fault.

772
00:36:23,617 --> 00:36:25,050
Thank you.

773
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,050
Can I just say one more thing?

774
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:28,717
Hmm?

775
00:36:28,717 --> 00:36:30,350
I would have kicked your ass today

776
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,717
if I hadn't started showing off.

777
00:36:31,717 --> 00:36:33,950
And if it was a girls- only competition.

778
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:34,950
You are...

779
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:47,983
What?

780
00:36:47,983 --> 00:36:49,150
Nothing. What?

781
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,451
Are we have a staring contest?

782
00:36:50,451 --> 00:36:51,784
No, dude.

783
00:36:51,784 --> 00:36:53,751
But, I mean, if we were,
I would totally win.

784
00:36:53,751 --> 00:36:54,918
Okay.

785
00:36:54,918 --> 00:36:55,918
Yeah, you're crazy.

786
00:36:55,918 --> 00:36:57,217
Okay.

787
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:58,217
Bye.

788
00:36:58,217 --> 00:36:59,250
Later on.

789
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,651
Screw all of them!

790
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:03,184
Let's just take the car
and-and never come back.

791
00:37:03,184 --> 00:37:04,484
I'm serious.

792
00:37:04,484 --> 00:37:06,851
We'll disappear, just the two of us.

793
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:08,050
Great. Okay.

794
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,083
Now, now, get to the car.

795
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:10,884
You're reckless, you're free.

796
00:37:12,551 --> 00:37:14,250
Keys.

797
00:37:15,584 --> 00:37:16,651
Go.

798
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,751
That was perfect.

799
00:37:20,751 --> 00:37:22,317
You are a natural, babe.

800
00:37:22,317 --> 00:37:23,317
How did it feel?

801
00:37:23,317 --> 00:37:24,551
Reckless.

802
00:37:24,551 --> 00:37:25,350
Free!
Yeah?

803
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,584
Well, let's go.

804
00:37:26,584 --> 00:37:27,851
Fire it up, floor it.

805
00:37:27,851 --> 00:37:29,751
Yeah!

806
00:37:29,751 --> 00:37:32,551
Yeah!

807
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:34,617
...seasonal temperatures, we
should reach our normal high

808
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:37,117
of about 82.
...month is over, you'll get five free...

809
00:37:43,684 --> 00:37:44,717
Hey, Kel.

810
00:37:44,717 --> 00:37:45,784
Oh, hey.

811
00:37:45,784 --> 00:37:47,751
Um, I was just calling to check in.

812
00:37:47,751 --> 00:37:50,384
Want to make sure everything was okay.

813
00:37:50,384 --> 00:37:52,451
Debbie seemed a little upset
when she left earlier,

814
00:37:52,451 --> 00:37:55,117
and I would hate if it had
anything to do with me.

815
00:37:55,117 --> 00:37:57,117
Actually, it did.

816
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:02,050
I know this is gonna sound crazy, but...

817
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:05,818
Debbie has it in her head
that you have a crush on me.

818
00:38:08,317 --> 00:38:10,317
That's ridiculous.

819
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:15,651
Yeah, it is.

820
00:38:15,651 --> 00:38:18,484
Listen, I... I got to, I got to go.

821
00:38:18,484 --> 00:38:20,384
We'll talk later, okay?

822
00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:22,317
All right.

823
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,050
Seriously, with the sighing?

824
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,017
I just want to go home.

825
00:38:33,017 --> 00:38:34,083
You know, I thought going

826
00:38:34,083 --> 00:38:35,284
to a Halloween party would

827
00:38:35,284 --> 00:38:37,851
take my mind off of Navid, but it hasn't.

828
00:38:37,851 --> 00:38:40,851
Just wait until my date gets here, okay?

829
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:43,350
Channel Marilyn; she suffered
a lot in her lifetime.

830
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,350
Marilyn never loved and lost Navid.

831
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,017
Well, she was pretty torn up over JFK.

832
00:38:48,184 --> 00:38:50,184
JFK was no Navid, I know.

833
00:38:51,517 --> 00:38:56,083
Actually, on second thought,
you can go home, Marilyn.

834
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,451
My date's arrived.

835
00:39:02,184 --> 00:39:03,184
Okay, wait a second.

836
00:39:03,184 --> 00:39:04,350
That's Richard?

837
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,784
He totally looks like he showers.

838
00:39:05,784 --> 00:39:07,551
No, that's Jamie.

839
00:39:07,551 --> 00:39:08,551
Hi.

840
00:39:08,551 --> 00:39:10,217
Hey, you.

841
00:39:10,217 --> 00:39:12,117
I'm glad you called.
I'm glad you came.

842
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:13,983
Um, my friend was just leaving.

843
00:39:13,983 --> 00:39:15,484
I'm gonna walk her out.

844
00:39:15,484 --> 00:39:17,317
I'll be right back.
Okay.

845
00:39:17,317 --> 00:39:18,317
Okay.

846
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,217
Um, okay, I am

847
00:39:23,217 --> 00:39:24,484
totally confused.

848
00:39:24,484 --> 00:39:25,983
I broke up with Richard.

849
00:39:25,983 --> 00:39:27,017
Apparently. Why?

850
00:39:27,017 --> 00:39:28,184
What happened?

851
00:39:28,184 --> 00:39:32,017
I saw Liam with this girl, looking all romantic.

852
00:39:33,217 --> 00:39:34,717
And I got upset and messed up,

853
00:39:34,717 --> 00:39:37,050
and I don't want to be
upset and messed up anymore.

854
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,184
And then it hit me.

855
00:39:38,184 --> 00:39:39,751
I'm never gonna get over him

856
00:39:39,751 --> 00:39:41,317
if I'm in a fake relationship,

857
00:39:41,317 --> 00:39:42,384
you know?

858
00:39:42,384 --> 00:39:44,584
Whereas with Jamie,
I really see potential.

859
00:39:44,584 --> 00:39:46,317
He could be the real
getting-over-Liam deal,

860
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,484
you know?

861
00:39:47,484 --> 00:39:49,150
I just have to give him a shot.

862
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,851
Even if it means

863
00:39:50,851 --> 00:39:52,983
studying to get into college.

864
00:39:54,217 --> 00:39:55,983
Well, I think you did the right thing.

865
00:39:57,983 --> 00:39:58,983
Yeah, me, too.

866
00:40:00,584 --> 00:40:02,584
Oh, you see him in shorts! Those thighs.

867
00:40:02,584 --> 00:40:04,417
Countries have gone to war, I know.

868
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:06,918
I know.

869
00:40:14,451 --> 00:40:15,617
Go on.

870
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,284
Even harder.

871
00:40:22,284 --> 00:40:23,451
Really smack it.

872
00:40:25,751 --> 00:40:28,083
It's the only way you're gonna feel better.

873
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:31,717
Nice.

874
00:40:40,717 --> 00:40:41,617
Even harder.

875
00:40:44,983 --> 00:40:46,884
Watch out.

876
00:40:47,884 --> 00:40:49,317
Ooh.

877
00:40:54,484 --> 00:40:57,117
Oh.

878
00:41:01,717 --> 00:41:03,651
Sasha?

879
00:41:03,651 --> 00:41:05,884
What are you doing here?

880
00:41:05,884 --> 00:41:08,150
First, I want to apologize.

881
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,150
I know I've been kind of needy lately.

882
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,484
No, look,

883
00:41:11,484 --> 00:41:13,217
look, it's okay.

884
00:41:13,217 --> 00:41:15,918
That's not why I ended things at all.

885
00:41:15,918 --> 00:41:19,017
I just feel like we're in two
different places in our life.

886
00:41:19,017 --> 00:41:23,684
Um, well, we're gonna need to
find a way to get in sync.

887
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:27,818
Because...

888
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,983
I'm pregnant.

889
00:41:29,983 --> 00:41:34,184
