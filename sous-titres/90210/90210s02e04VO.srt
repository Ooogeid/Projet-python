1
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:20,767
Uh, yeah, I should, um, go give this to my boyfriend.

2
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:21,968
I'm Dixon, by the way.

3
00:00:21,968 --> 00:00:23,067
I'm Sasha.

4
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:25,167
So, you DJ?
I do.

5
00:00:25,167 --> 00:00:27,701
You know, I'm... I'm in the music business.

6
00:00:27,701 --> 00:00:29,701
I didn't want to tell Naomi
what happened between us,

7
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:31,868
because she was done with me, but she's not.

8
00:00:31,868 --> 00:00:33,334
And she needs to know the truth.

9
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:35,200
And when I deny it, who do
you think she's gonna believe?

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,334
What do you two want?
Naomi, we need to tell you

11
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:39,534
the truth about that night...
we totally slept together.

12
00:00:39,534 --> 00:00:41,868
Back on me now. No! No!
Naomi, She's lying to you.

13
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:43,000
Might want to click that,

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,267
'cause we're going to Napa.

15
00:00:56,501 --> 00:00:58,267
Mmm.

16
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:01,200
This is incredible.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,601
Mm.

18
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:04,734
You are incredible.

19
00:01:04,734 --> 00:01:07,567
Uh...

20
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:14,234
I want...

21
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:16,267
Ooh... I want what's under there.

22
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:22,133
Hey.

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,934
I got a treat for you.

24
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:35,601
Hey?

25
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:38,334
Hey.

26
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:40,100
You okay, sweetie?

27
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,367
Yeah.

28
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,801
Yeah, I just... I...

29
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:44,100
I guess I fell asleep.

30
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,267
Ooh!

31
00:01:45,267 --> 00:01:46,501
How could you

32
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:48,467
when it's so positively
thrilling around here?

33
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:49,701
Oh, don't get me wrong.

34
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:51,067
Love working weekends.

35
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:52,133
Just wish it was a three-day weekend,

36
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:53,934
you know,  I could give more to the Blaze.

37
00:01:53,934 --> 00:01:56,267
Yeah, thanks. It's the kind of
sarcasm I need from my staff.

38
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:57,467
Thanks.

39
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:59,067
Oh, Chinese food! Chinese food!

40
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:00,234
Keep ordering from Mr. Chow,

41
00:02:00,234 --> 00:02:02,234
and I will work any Sunday you want, boss.

42
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:04,067
Perfect. Your boyfriend rocks, by the way.

43
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:05,234
I know.

44
00:02:05,234 --> 00:02:06,434
I rock.

45
00:02:06,434 --> 00:02:07,868
He totally rocks.

46
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:23,334
Oh, I love the bass on this part.

47
00:02:23,334 --> 00:02:25,367
Yeah, it's, like, boom, boom, boom.

48
00:02:25,367 --> 00:02:26,634
Right?

49
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:29,100
Boom, boom, boom.

50
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,968
Boom, boom, boom.

51
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,334
Ooh!
Oh!

52
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:45,534
Oh.
Sorry.

53
00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:46,801
Yeah.
Oh.

54
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:48,067
One second.

55
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,667
Oh.

56
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:51,067
It's Navid.

57
00:02:51,067 --> 00:02:52,501
Oh, again?
Yeah.

58
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:55,534
I got to tell you, that guy is dedicated to his job.

59
00:02:56,834 --> 00:02:58,968
Yeah, I think I better take this one.

60
00:02:58,968 --> 00:03:01,901
Oh, well, I will take a shower.

61
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:04,067
Yes, because you are a dirty girl.

62
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:05,334
Mm, filthy.

63
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:16,367
What's up?

64
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:18,701
A couples' massage?

65
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:20,300
You got a $400 couples' massage?

66
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,834
I just checked my credit card charges online.

67
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:24,767
Navid, uh, you know, feel free

68
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:27,334
to take the rest of the night off, you know,

69
00:03:27,334 --> 00:03:29,334
uh, you've worked hard enough this week.

70
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,534
Yeah, I've been working hard.

71
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:32,601
I'm sorry to be the bearer of a reality check,

72
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:34,033
but have you lost your freaking mind?

73
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:35,200
Sort of.

74
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,367
Oh, man.

75
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:37,901
All right, look.

76
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:39,868
I'll pay you back for the couples' massage,

77
00:03:39,868 --> 00:03:41,701
all right?
But I'm telling you,

78
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:43,367
it was worth it.

79
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:45,367
Navid, my friend,

80
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:47,501
I am living the dream.

81
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:50,601
Uh, Dixon, my friend you are living a lie.

82
00:03:50,601 --> 00:03:52,834
Look, I'm going to come clean.

83
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:54,934
When?

84
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,701
I don't know. Um, later.

85
00:03:56,701 --> 00:03:58,300
When the time is right.

86
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,567
Okay, I don't know how you can
handle this stress, okay?

87
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:02,167
I can't. I've got sensitive skin, okay?

88
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:04,100
And I'm, like, covered with hives.

89
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,400
Navid, all right, look, man,

90
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,801
I'm sorry I'm stressing you out, okay?

91
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:09,434
I am very appreciative for everything

92
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:11,100
that you've been doing... you know,

93
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,767
loaning me your dad's car,

94
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:15,267
renting out this hotel room for us.

95
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:16,634
Covering for you with your parents.

96
00:04:16,634 --> 00:04:18,100
By the way,

97
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,801
we've been working on a science project

98
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,000
involving the tsetse fly.

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,300
The what what?

100
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,467
The tsetse fly.

101
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:24,934
Remember that. It's important

102
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:26,934
to have details down
in case your dad asks on Monday.

103
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,100
Oh, man, your dad.

104
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,300
You better be in school tomorrow,

105
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,801
or else, I... I don't know what I'll do.

106
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:32,033
If... if he, like, interrogates me,

107
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:34,701
if he interrogates me, I will so give you up.

108
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:36,133
Navid!
I don't do well under pressure.

109
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:37,601
This is why I couldn't be a spy.

110
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:39,167
I get all hivey and honest.

111
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:40,467
Dixon?!

112
00:04:40,467 --> 00:04:41,701
Come join me in the shower!

113
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:44,467
I got to go.

114
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:46,467
Dixon?

115
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:48,100
Hello?

116
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:04,100
What are you doing here?

117
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,200
I'm meeting someone.

118
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,234
Who? Annie the skank?

119
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:10,701
Teddy.

120
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:12,167
We're going surfing.

121
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:13,801
Look, none of what Annie said on the boat

122
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:15,868
was true... none of it.

123
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:17,467
We never had sex.

124
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:20,968
Not a bunch of times, not once.

125
00:05:20,968 --> 00:05:23,133
Never.

126
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:26,267
Naomi, you have to trust me.

127
00:05:27,734 --> 00:05:29,133
Trust you?

128
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:30,834
That's a laugh.

129
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:33,400
What do you know about trust, huh?

130
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,734
Trust

131
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:37,200
is what Naomi and I have.

132
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,868
We look out for each other.

133
00:05:38,868 --> 00:05:40,434
We take care of each other.

134
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:42,567
I can trust her, she can trust me.

135
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:45,667
And we both can't trust you.

136
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:46,868
Now shoo!

137
00:05:46,868 --> 00:05:48,434
Hasta luego.

138
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:02,234
News alert!

139
00:06:02,234 --> 00:06:04,868
Four golf carts were stolen

140
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:06,901
from the Westwood Country Club.

141
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:11,300
Okay, it's a lame story.

142
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,801
Um...

143
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:15,601
Um, guys, I think I got a good one.

144
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:16,934
You remember that homeless guy that was killed

145
00:06:16,934 --> 00:06:18,067
in the hit-and-run on prom night?

146
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:19,200
Yeah.

147
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
The one that Teddy Montgomery

148
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,300
found on the side of the road?

149
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,133
Yeah. Why?
Oh, my God.

150
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,367
What?

151
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:25,567
Whoa.
Gia!

152
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:27,701
Sorry. Um...

153
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:30,567
the homeless guy just donated
$100,000 to West Bev.

154
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:31,801
What?

155
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:33,267
Why?

156
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,300
How does a homeless guy have $100,000?

157
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,834
Good questions.
Go find out.

158
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:38,634
Silver, you report it. Gia,

159
00:06:38,634 --> 00:06:40,100
produce the piece.
Yeah!

160
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,100
Sweet.

161
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,634
Adrianna.

162
00:06:51,634 --> 00:06:53,801
What's up, Mom?

163
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:56,834
Let's see.

164
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,601
What are you doing?

165
00:06:58,601 --> 00:07:01,434
I'm just checking to make sure
you haven't injured your hand.

166
00:07:01,434 --> 00:07:02,901
Your fingers aren't broken, are they?

167
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:04,400
Uh... no.

168
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,834
Then how come you haven't called
your agent in two weeks, huh?

169
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:10,133
Mom, I told you I am not auditioning.

170
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:12,267
Whatever. Luckily, I called her myself...

171
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:15,634
and she got you an audition for a mid-season pilot.

172
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:16,968
Really?

173
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:17,801
Yeah.

174
00:07:17,801 --> 00:07:20,634
Ugh.

175
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:22,300
I'm not auditioning.

176
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,634
Oh, God!

177
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:25,467
Who do you think you are, Julia Roberts?

178
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:27,267
What's that supposed to mean?

179
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:29,367
Elise said that if you didn't show up

180
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:31,000
to the audition, she's dropping you

181
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,300
for good.

182
00:07:45,968 --> 00:07:47,834
Oh, no!

183
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,634
No, no!
What's wrong?

184
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:52,400
Uh, we overslept. I'm... I'm late.

185
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,067
We got to go. Please, get up.

186
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:01,567
Good morning, Skank.

187
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:03,367
Get a life, Naomi.

188
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:05,367
Hey, do you, uh...

189
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:07,000
You want to hang out later?

190
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,334
Maybe. I'll let you know.

191
00:08:09,334 --> 00:08:11,334
Yo, Annie, I got a mouse pad made

192
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:12,868
with the image from your sext.

193
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,067
Closest you'll ever get to a girl.

194
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:17,200
First of all, I want to say

195
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,167
how sorry I am for your loss.

196
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,767
Thanks.

197
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:24,067
So, how did you find out about
what had happened to him?

198
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:26,033
What's going on?
You know that homeless guy

199
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:27,434
that was killed in the hit-and-run?

200
00:08:27,434 --> 00:08:28,701
His name is Joe Herman.

201
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:30,267
Apparently, he went here,

202
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:33,133
and he donated, like, $100,000
to West Bev in his will.

203
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:34,501
What?!
I know. Crazy, right?

204
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:35,801
Check this out for crazy.

205
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:36,968
His nephew goes here.

206
00:08:36,968 --> 00:08:38,434
That's him.

207
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,033
His death must have been such a shock, huh?

208
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:42,334
Yeah.

209
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:44,167
Yeah, it was.

210
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:55,567
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny - corrected by chamallow35</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

211
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:10,367
I don't mean to pry. I just think that the students

212
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:12,001
of West Beverly would like to know

213
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:13,500
about their mysterious benefactor.

214
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,801
Oh, they do, huh?

215
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:16,333
Lucky me.

216
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,134
This must be what it's like to be popular.

217
00:09:19,134 --> 00:09:21,967
Can you tell us anything else about your uncle?

218
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:23,734
He was nuts.

219
00:09:23,734 --> 00:09:25,367
Schizo.

220
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:28,701
Um, he was... he was mentally ill?

221
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:31,001
Whatever you want to call it.

222
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:32,333
Wait a minute.

223
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,534
You're that crazy chick.

224
00:09:34,534 --> 00:09:36,634
Uh, mentally ill chick.

225
00:09:36,634 --> 00:09:40,333
Seriously, I loved that
movie you made last year.

226
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,534
It was like a mix between early Cocteau

227
00:09:42,534 --> 00:09:47,034
meets, uh, Un Chien Andalou
meets something wack.

228
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:49,400
Uh, back to your uncle.

229
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,034
Why do you think he left
all his money to our school?

230
00:09:52,034 --> 00:09:54,200
Beats me.

231
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,901
Are there any leads in this case?

232
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:58,801
Please.

233
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:01,233
To the cops, he was just another homeless guy

234
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:04,333
left behind like a piece of garbage.

235
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:08,134
The person who hit him and left him behind

236
00:10:08,134 --> 00:10:11,101
on the side of the road
was the piece of garbage.

237
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,068
Hey, Millicent, great goal against Fairfax.

238
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:20,101
Sweeper never even saw it coming.

239
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:21,901
Good job.

240
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:24,267
Hey, Gavin, I told you, no skates at school!

241
00:10:24,267 --> 00:10:25,367
You said no rollerblading.

242
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:27,168
No, I said no rolling

243
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,200
wheels that attach to your feet.

244
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:32,767
Hey, Navid?

245
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:34,701
Ah, Principal Wilson!

246
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:35,901
Hey!

247
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,767
How you doing?
Eh.

248
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,901
Hey, how about that homeless guy?

249
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:42,101
$100,000 for the school!

250
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:44,701
That's a pretty amazing story.

251
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:46,600
Uh, the Blaze is all over that,

252
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,567
just so you know, so don't you worry.

253
00:10:48,567 --> 00:10:50,534
I'm gonna, uh, covert the heck out of it.

254
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:52,333
Okay?

255
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,600
Hey, so, where's Dixon?

256
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,134
I haven't seen him in all morning.

257
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:56,400
Everything okay?

258
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,500
He's, uh...

259
00:11:00,734 --> 00:11:03,101
Well, the thing is, he's...

260
00:11:03,101 --> 00:11:06,367
Hey! What's up, Dad?

261
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,600
Navid, where the heck have you been, man?

262
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,400
I've been looking all over for you.

263
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,934
We got to polish up that tsetse
fly presentation, man.
Yeah.

264
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:15,600
That'd be great.
Yeah.

265
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,068
So, uh, we're gonna get going.

266
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:19,300
See you later, Pops.
Later. Yeah.

267
00:11:21,168 --> 00:11:22,500
I'm covered with hives, bro.

268
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,767
Than, man. Thanks.

269
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:27,500
Hey!

270
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,834
Um, hey.

271
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:30,667
Do you want to go grab
some lunch or something?

272
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:32,834
Uh... I... I, I can't.

273
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:34,034
I have abs.

274
00:11:34,034 --> 00:11:35,634
Um, I mean, lab.

275
00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:38,367
I got... I got chemistry lab.

276
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,300
So, um... yeah, I'm late.

277
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,300
Bye.
Bye.

278
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,333
Ugh...

279
00:11:46,434 --> 00:11:48,168
Oh, my God!

280
00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:50,200
We've got to go to the "Ark de Triumph."

281
00:11:51,634 --> 00:11:53,500
L'Arc De Triomphe.

282
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,034
You are so adorable.

283
00:11:57,534 --> 00:11:59,400
You are wonderful.
Yeah, well.

284
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,034
I can't believe you're taking me to Paris!

285
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:02,734
I've never been out of the country.

286
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:04,834
Yeah, you have.

287
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:06,333
Dad took you to Canada.

288
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,734
Yeah, well, well...

289
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:11,034
Montreal's no Paris.

290
00:12:11,034 --> 00:12:13,333
Just saying, you said you'd never
been out of the country,

291
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,701
and you have.

292
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:17,734
Hey, Liam.

293
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:20,834
How about you don't use
that tone with your mother?

294
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:22,068
Okay?

295
00:12:24,634 --> 00:12:27,001
Hey.
Would you look at this?

296
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:28,634
We know her, don't we?

297
00:12:30,634 --> 00:12:32,667
Yeah.

298
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:36,168
Yeah, we do.

299
00:12:36,168 --> 00:12:38,333
I can't believe people would rather read this

300
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,901
than watch the Blaze.
I mean, really?

301
00:12:39,901 --> 00:12:42,400
This is an insult to student intelligence.

302
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,434
Yeah. Sasha and I both hate celebrity news.

303
00:12:45,434 --> 00:12:48,667
I mean, it's like we're both so in tune, kid.

304
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:51,767
Ah... you guys are like Siamese twins, huh?

305
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,834
Did I tell you guys that we both like DJ/rupture?

306
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:57,834
Yeah, and Roy Campanella. And Orange Sherbert.

307
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:59,001
And Casablanca.

308
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:01,267
All right, all right!

309
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:04,233
Geez. It's just that I've never found anybody

310
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:06,267
who gets me like she does, you know?

311
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:08,500
It like she knows me, man.

312
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,400
Right, she knows you.

313
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,867
Except for the little fact

314
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:13,434
that you are a junior in high school.

315
00:13:13,434 --> 00:13:14,467
Little fact.

316
00:13:14,467 --> 00:13:16,333
Yeah, I'm going to tell her, guys.

317
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:18,200
You could invite her to junior prom.

318
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,101
Tell her there. Yeah.
Shut up.

319
00:13:20,101 --> 00:13:22,567
Both of you, a right? I'm gonna
tell her. I'm going to do it.

320
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,267
Just when the time's right.

321
00:13:34,434 --> 00:13:36,901
Beautiful night, isn't it?

322
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,701
What are you doing here?

323
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:41,068
We need to talk.

324
00:13:41,068 --> 00:13:42,600
In private.

325
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,534
Should I leave you alone or...

326
00:13:44,534 --> 00:13:46,600
You know what?
It doesn't have to be in private.

327
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,267
I don't mind discussing Olivier

328
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:51,267
in front of your date.

329
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:54,300
Darling, go inside.

330
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,767
I'll be right in.

331
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:57,934
Okay.
Okay.

332
00:14:00,767 --> 00:14:02,767
What are you talking about?

333
00:14:09,801 --> 00:14:12,134
How did you...?

334
00:14:12,134 --> 00:14:13,767
Oh, finding the picture was luck.

335
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:15,801
Then I got on the Internet.

336
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:18,168
A lot comes up, it turns out.

337
00:14:18,168 --> 00:14:20,434
Partied pretty hard, huh?

338
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:22,500
Chased after a lot of guys with money

339
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,434
and titles.
You don't know anything.

340
00:14:25,434 --> 00:14:28,267
And then, you landed Olivier.

341
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:31,434
Rich, a baron.

342
00:14:31,434 --> 00:14:34,434
Perfect fairy tale for a gold digger.

343
00:14:34,434 --> 00:14:37,300
I mean, "happily ever after," right?

344
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,600
Until your marriage ended after one month.

345
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,068
According to the French tabloids,

346
00:14:41,068 --> 00:14:44,068
you are such a spendaholic
that, when you guys split up,

347
00:14:44,068 --> 00:14:45,701
you were broke.

348
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:47,168
You know what's funny?

349
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:49,400
Naomi never told me you were married.

350
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,500
Or broke.

351
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Or does she not know?

352
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,567
Because...

353
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:56,233
I thought your whole relationship

354
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:57,367
was based on trust.

355
00:14:57,367 --> 00:14:59,333
What do you want?

356
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,467
I want you to tell her
what happened on prom night.

357
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:04,233
Fine.

358
00:15:05,434 --> 00:15:07,667
Give me 24 hours.

359
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:08,634
Fine.

360
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,567
Man, agents are scum. Trying to
blackmail you into auditioning.

361
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:22,267
Yeah, but if I just go on this one audition,

362
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:24,667
all I miss this afternoon is Humanities.
Wait, I don't get it.

363
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,734
I thought you didn't want
to do the acting thing anymore.

364
00:15:26,734 --> 00:15:28,933
No, it's not that I don't want to,

365
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:31,701
it's just... ugh...

366
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:34,501
I just think it's probably a good idea to take a break.

367
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,067
Huh. Agreed.

368
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:38,200
But I don't want my agent to drop me.

369
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,501
I mean, acting is my passion.

370
00:15:40,501 --> 00:15:42,501
I'm going to go back to it eventually.

371
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,534
Oh, yeah, and then when you're ready,

372
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:46,701
you'll get a new agent.

373
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:50,234
Uh, I'm sorry, no offense.

374
00:15:50,234 --> 00:15:52,033
You, you don't know what
you're talking about.

375
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:53,434
That's not how things work.
Why not?

376
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:55,267
You're pretty amazing.

377
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:59,134
Um... baby, I am a green-eyed brunette

378
00:15:59,134 --> 00:16:01,067
who can cry on command.
Hmm.

379
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:04,401
Do you know how many other
girls there are just like me.
Yeah.

380
00:16:04,401 --> 00:16:06,067
I do.

381
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:07,734
Zero.

382
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,401
Don't do it. Don't go.

383
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,667
No, I'm serious.

384
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:13,567
You know how that world makes you.

385
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,267
All that Hollywood insanity,

386
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:17,234
it just chews people up and spits them out.

387
00:16:17,234 --> 00:16:18,567
Look at you.

388
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:20,033
Look what happened to you last year:

389
00:16:20,033 --> 00:16:21,601
all the drugs, the pregnancy...

390
00:16:21,601 --> 00:16:23,734
No, I know, I was there. I remember.

391
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,467
You're doing it, you know?

392
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:27,467
And you even reach that title

393
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:29,601
of, uh, "No Drama Adrianna."

394
00:16:29,601 --> 00:16:30,868
Hey, you two.

395
00:16:30,868 --> 00:16:32,100
Hey.

396
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,067
You guys ever take a class with Mr. Lichtenstein?

397
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:38,601
The guy's like a freaking terrorist.

398
00:16:38,601 --> 00:16:39,933
Dude, you're taking him before lunch?

399
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:41,634
Yeah.
Once his blood sugar drops

400
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:44,601
you're done-zo.
Dude, unreal.

401
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:47,067
You mind if I grab a few fries?

402
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:49,100
Yeah.
All right.

403
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,234
Feel free.

404
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:52,933
Um, I gotta go.

405
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:55,100
Uh, make a call to my agent.

406
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,267
Yeah?
Yeah.

407
00:16:56,267 --> 00:16:58,667
Cool.
But I will see you later?

408
00:16:58,667 --> 00:16:59,801
Okay. Bye, babe.
Mm-hmm.

409
00:16:59,801 --> 00:17:01,134
By

410
00:17:19,434 --> 00:17:21,067
Hey.

411
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:22,834
Hey.

412
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:27,033
I... I just wanted to say that, um...

413
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:29,134
I'm real sorry about your uncle.

414
00:17:29,134 --> 00:17:31,067
Okay.

415
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,067
Thanks.

416
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:37,634
I'm just so sorry.

417
00:17:39,033 --> 00:17:40,634
Why?

418
00:17:40,634 --> 00:17:42,134
Did you know him or something?

419
00:17:42,134 --> 00:17:44,434
Uh, no, um...

420
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:46,267
No, it... it... it's sad

421
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:49,267
and, and I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry.

422
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:50,734
That's all.

423
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,501
Teddy!

424
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:00,434
Vicky.

425
00:18:00,434 --> 00:18:03,033
So, hey, I'm working on a piece for the Blaze

426
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:05,067
about Joe Herman, and I was really hoping

427
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:07,000
to get a comment from you.

428
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,868
I mean, after all,you were the
one who discovered his body.

429
00:18:09,868 --> 00:18:11,167
Yeah, well, I was surprised.

430
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:13,933
I mean, a hundred grand, that's pretty generous.

431
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:15,701
I thought he was just homeless guy.

432
00:18:15,701 --> 00:18:17,868
I'm sorry...

433
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:19,167
"Just a homeless guy"?

434
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:22,334
Okay, that didn't come out right.

435
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:26,567
I meant an... an "abode-challenged individual."

436
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:28,000
Do you think being homeless is funny?

437
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,200
Don't you?

438
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,701
Look, they live in cardboard boxes,

439
00:18:30,701 --> 00:18:32,234
use grocery carts as means of locomotion...

440
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:37,234
I'm kidding. I'm kidding!

441
00:18:37,234 --> 00:18:39,200
Why don't you go down to
Venice Boulevard to do that set?

442
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,267
I mean, maybe, you can start off with:

443
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:42,701
"Hey, I'm Teddy.

444
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:44,434
"My dad is a major movie star
and I'll never have

445
00:18:44,434 --> 00:18:46,267
to work a day in my life."
All right. All right.

446
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:47,933
I get you. It was in bad taste.

447
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:49,434
Whatever, um...

448
00:18:49,434 --> 00:18:50,801
Can you do the interview, please?

449
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:51,933
About Joe Herman?

450
00:18:51,933 --> 00:18:53,367
I...

451
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:55,167
You know what? I can't

452
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,100
No, thanks.

453
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,367
"No, thanks"?

454
00:18:58,367 --> 00:18:59,900
You got to leave me out of it okay?

455
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,534
All right, look, maybe you saw something

456
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:03,167
that you don't think is important...
Look!

457
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:05,367
I can't do it okay?

458
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:08,100
Got .

459
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,401
You can joke about the homeless,

460
00:19:09,401 --> 00:19:10,967
but you can't devote a single second

461
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:12,200
of your precious time

462
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,033
for one of them who was murdered.

463
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:16,000
It's fabulous.

464
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:18,734
Swinson.

465
00:19:18,734 --> 00:19:21,601
Tahmaseb.

466
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:23,567
Tate-Duncan?

467
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:26,567
Has anyone seen Adrianna?

468
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,100
Navid, do you know where she is?

469
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,768
Uh...

470
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:32,300
I think she's at a doctor's appointment.

471
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,267
Ok.

472
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,768
Hey.

473
00:19:48,768 --> 00:19:50,933
Sweetie...

474
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:52,367
Come sit down over here with me.

475
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:56,000
There's something we need to talk about.

476
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,167
I have to tell you something.

477
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:06,834
Something that's gonna upset you.

478
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:08,734
What is it, Jen? You're scaring me.

479
00:20:08,734 --> 00:20:12,467
The thing is, Naomi...

480
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:13,768
I'm married.

481
00:20:13,768 --> 00:20:17,200
What?
Well, it was a quite impulsive, really.

482
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,834
We met last year and two
months later we were married.

483
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:22,501
His name Olivier.

484
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:23,534
He's French.

485
00:20:23,534 --> 00:20:24,967
Why didn't you tell me?

486
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:27,734
Because.

487
00:20:27,734 --> 00:20:32,067
Because right after we were married, I walked in

488
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:34,367
on Olivier in bed with another woman.

489
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,534
And I left him.
Oh, my God.

490
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:38,367
There's more.

491
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:39,834
What more?

492
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:42,701
Well, when I told you

493
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:45,534
my money was "tied up" in Europe,

494
00:20:45,534 --> 00:20:49,134
that wasn't exactly true.

495
00:20:49,134 --> 00:20:51,534
The truth is that...

496
00:20:51,534 --> 00:20:54,868
I spent it all before met Olivier.

497
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,100
And now I'm broke.

498
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,334
I've been paying for everything:

499
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:04,100
the rent, your clothes, your car

500
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,033
your twice-weekly appointments

501
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:07,834
at the Face Place.

502
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:10,534
What were you planning to do,
live off me forever, Jen?

503
00:21:10,534 --> 00:21:12,234
No, of course not.

504
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:13,900
And I have every intention

505
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,567
of paying you back.

506
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,868
I just needed to get out of Europe and clear my head

507
00:21:17,868 --> 00:21:19,401
and figure out what to do.

508
00:21:19,401 --> 00:21:21,234
There's only one answer.

509
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:23,900
I'm going back to Olivier.
What?

510
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,801
I can't live off you anymore.

511
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:28,134
I... I just can't.

512
00:21:28,134 --> 00:21:30,768
It won't be so bad.

513
00:21:30,768 --> 00:21:34,434
Olivier wants me back and...

514
00:21:34,434 --> 00:21:36,734
I think I can live with an open marriage.

515
00:21:36,734 --> 00:21:39,900
"An open marriage"?!

516
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,467
Jen!

517
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,768
What are you out of your mind? No.

518
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:45,334
I have too much pride anyway.

519
00:21:45,334 --> 00:21:47,601
Maybe it'll be good for me,

520
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:49,501
in some sort of spiritual sense.

521
00:21:50,933 --> 00:21:52,267
And plus, when I'm back with Olivier,

522
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:54,267
I... I will pay you back right away.

523
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:55,768
You'll have your trust fund back.

524
00:21:55,768 --> 00:21:58,933
I'm not worried about my stupid trust fund.

525
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:01,601
I'm worried about you.

526
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:02,933
Look, look at me.

527
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:05,267
You.

528
00:22:05,267 --> 00:22:07,601
Ok, you're not going back to some

529
00:22:07,601 --> 00:22:09,434
loveless marriage with some loser who will

530
00:22:09,434 --> 00:22:10,768
cheat on you like Dad did with Mom.

531
00:22:10,768 --> 00:22:12,401
No way in hell.

532
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:14,567
Maybe if I just go back with Olivier.

533
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:15,768
Over my dead body.

534
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,667
Stop it!

535
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:20,033
I don't want to hear another word about it.

536
00:22:25,634 --> 00:22:29,467
I didn't know Joe myself,
but I've had a chance now

537
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:32,134
to talk to some of his teachers and fellow students

538
00:22:32,134 --> 00:22:34,434
who knew him when he was here at West Bev,

539
00:22:34,434 --> 00:22:37,768
and this is what I've discovered.

540
00:22:37,768 --> 00:22:39,768
Joe loved earth science.

541
00:22:39,768 --> 00:22:43,634
He petitioned the school
to buy an electron microscope.

542
00:22:43,634 --> 00:22:48,701
His sophomore year, he played
varsity soccer for three years.

543
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:52,667
Joe also participated in two school plays.

544
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:55,367
He was Artie in The House of Blue Leaves,

545
00:22:55,367 --> 00:22:57,834
and he was the narrator in Our Town.

546
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:02,067
Joe Herman was a West Bev
student, like all  you

547
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:03,567
Like was.

548
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:06,100
He was one of us.

549
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:21,167
Look, I'm getting you
to Geoffrey's before sunset.

550
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:23,067
I don't care how many tickets I get.

551
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:24,534
You hungry?

552
00:23:24,534 --> 00:23:26,701
No, I'm starving, and excited
about eating at Geoffrey's.

553
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:29,701
Yeah, there's nothing

554
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:32,367
like a little herb rusted salmon by the sea.

555
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:34,367
Yeah.

556
00:23:37,534 --> 00:23:40,768
You know, I gotta tell you something, Dixon...

557
00:23:40,768 --> 00:23:44,334
I'm not really use to this whole fancy cars,

558
00:23:44,334 --> 00:23:46,334
fancy dinners things.

559
00:23:46,334 --> 00:23:50,234
Honestly, I have, like,
$100,000 in student loans;

560
00:23:50,234 --> 00:23:54,267
I... I have a roommate and, most nights,

561
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:56,567
when I'm not with you, I...

562
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:59,033
I eat ramen noodles.

563
00:23:59,033 --> 00:24:00,200
Sasha...

564
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,933
No, I know, I know, I know.

565
00:24:01,933 --> 00:24:03,734
I probably shouldn't be telling you this,

566
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,701
'cause L.A. is all about appearances, but...

567
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:08,067
I don't know, it's...

568
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:10,067
when I'm with you, it's, like,

569
00:24:10,067 --> 00:24:11,900
I feel like I can be real.

570
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,434
You know? I feel like I can tell you anything.

571
00:24:16,234 --> 00:24:18,234
Hey, Sasha?

572
00:24:18,234 --> 00:24:19,900
Yeah?

573
00:24:21,734 --> 00:24:24,401
All right, what were you like
when you were younger?

574
00:24:24,401 --> 00:24:25,601
When I was younger?

575
00:24:25,601 --> 00:24:27,234
Yeah, like, um,

576
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:28,601
high school.

577
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:30,900
Oh, man, that was a long time ago.

578
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,100
Um, I guess like every other high school kid.

579
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,467
Dumb as dirt.

580
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:38,100
Thought I knew everything, really knew nothing.

581
00:24:41,434 --> 00:24:42,933
I mean, but, you know,

582
00:24:42,933 --> 00:24:46,167
there... there are some high school
kids that are mature, right?

583
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:48,334
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure they think they are.

584
00:24:48,334 --> 00:24:49,567
I mean, but, come on.

585
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:51,434
How mature can they really be?

586
00:24:51,434 --> 00:24:52,601
They haven't done anything.

587
00:24:52,601 --> 00:24:53,933
I mean, come on.

588
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:56,267
Think about how different
you are since you graduated.

589
00:24:56,267 --> 00:24:58,334
Yeah, worlds away, right?

590
00:24:58,334 --> 00:25:00,334
Yeah, yeah, I... I guess you're right.

591
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:01,967
Mm.

592
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:08,467
And so, I said to Warren Beatty, "Back off man.

593
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,134
I'm hitting on this girl."

594
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,634
You did not say that.

595
00:25:11,634 --> 00:25:13,701
Yes, I did.

596
00:25:13,701 --> 00:25:15,467
Does anyone care for an hors d'oeuvre?

597
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:16,634
Oh, yeah, sure.
Awesome.

598
00:25:16,634 --> 00:25:17,801
These look great.

599
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:18,967
These are wonderful.

600
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:20,134
Awesome.
Got it.

601
00:25:20,134 --> 00:25:21,501
Thanks, man.
Enjoy yourself.

602
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:22,768
Wow.

603
00:25:22,768 --> 00:25:24,868
I can't believe you talked to that guy.

604
00:25:24,868 --> 00:25:27,367
Don't you know he's just a waiter?

605
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:31,167
All right, look, I was a jerk earlier.

606
00:25:32,634 --> 00:25:34,667
I told a few jokes that were...

607
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:37,000
Well, they were in bad taste, and I'm sorry

608
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
about it.

609
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Are we cool now?

610
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,401
It depends.

611
00:25:40,401 --> 00:25:41,834
Will you do the interview?

612
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:43,067
I can't.

613
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:46,000
Right, because even though you're sorry,

614
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,900
you're still a huge snob

615
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,634
with a huge ego who thinks his time is too precious

616
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:52,200
to spend, uh, five minutes

617
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,634
talking about someone who's just a homeless guy.

618
00:25:54,634 --> 00:25:56,734
That's not the reason.
Then why can't you do it?

619
00:25:56,734 --> 00:25:58,300
Because I'm not allowed to, okay?

620
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,967
There's an ongoing

621
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:02,367
investigation, and I'm a part of it.

622
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:04,801
I really screwed up by talking to Navid before.

623
00:26:04,801 --> 00:26:07,334
I could've ruined the entire investigation.

624
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:10,933
I can talk to the police, and that's it.

625
00:26:10,933 --> 00:26:12,200
But not to you.

626
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,434
Because you know what?

627
00:26:13,434 --> 00:26:16,267
You're not a cop, you're not a detective.

628
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:17,868
You're just a high school student.

629
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:23,701
Awkward.

630
00:26:33,933 --> 00:26:36,367
So, you actually went to your audition?

631
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:38,367
Well, yeah.

632
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:40,667
I wanted to keep my options open.

633
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:43,900
What, are you disappointed in me?

634
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,734
No, I'm not going to deny it... I am disappointed.

635
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,100
Don't you remember all the things

636
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,267
that we went through last year?

637
00:26:49,267 --> 00:26:50,567
Okay, well, believe it or not,

638
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,033
I didn't do blow in the bathroom.

639
00:26:52,033 --> 00:26:53,033
Ade this isn't a joke.

640
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:55,434
Okay, it's not a joke to me, either.

641
00:26:55,434 --> 00:26:57,401
Just trying to keep things light.

642
00:26:57,401 --> 00:26:59,200
Okay, it was one audition...

643
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,401
one... I just wish you would understand

644
00:27:01,401 --> 00:27:03,801
what this means to me, how acting makes me feel.

645
00:27:03,801 --> 00:27:05,134
Yeah, and I wish for once

646
00:27:05,134 --> 00:27:06,401
that you would understand how you

647
00:27:06,401 --> 00:27:07,734
make me feel, okay?

648
00:27:07,734 --> 00:27:09,234
This involves me, too, right?

649
00:27:09,234 --> 00:27:11,067
I mean, your actions have ramifications.

650
00:27:11,067 --> 00:27:12,234
I've been there through everything.
Mm.

651
00:27:12,234 --> 00:27:13,401
Through the rehab, the pregnancy,

652
00:27:13,401 --> 00:27:14,501
the giving up your...

653
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:15,701
Okay, what are you trying to do?

654
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:17,100
Are you trying to make me feel guilty?

655
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,067
No, Ade, I'm just trying to help you.

656
00:27:19,067 --> 00:27:20,501
Well, maybe I don't need your help.

657
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:27,267
Oh, I gotta take this.

658
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:29,501
Hello?

659
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:34,100
Um, wow.

660
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,100
Okay.

661
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:39,501
Okay.

662
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,167
Thank you.

663
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:44,167
Yeah.

664
00:27:45,401 --> 00:27:47,401
Bye.

665
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:52,967
Um, that was my agent.

666
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:54,933
I got the part.

667
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:57,100
We, congratulations.

668
00:27:59,701 --> 00:28:01,300
Well, I'm glad you came, Annie.

669
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,300
Yeah, it was really sweet of you.

670
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,501
Mm.

671
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:05,701
Oh, it's so sad.

672
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:07,801
Huh? Poor man, just lost his way;

673
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:09,367
fell through the cracks.

674
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:11,134
Yeah. Um, if you guys
don't need me for anything,

675
00:28:11,134 --> 00:28:12,200
I'm just gonna head home.

676
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,634
I'm pretty exhausted.

677
00:28:13,634 --> 00:28:15,467
Yeah, honey, go ahead.
Yeah, we'll be home soon.

678
00:28:21,267 --> 00:28:22,868
Okay, Navid, um, look,

679
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,334
if I use my triple A, they'll ask to see my license, right?

680
00:28:25,334 --> 00:28:27,734
And there it'll be me, Dixon Wilson,

681
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:29,667
17 years old, driving your father's car.

682
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,501
Change the tire.

683
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,000
I don't know how to change a tire on that.

684
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,067
It's like a freakin' spaceship.

685
00:28:34,067 --> 00:28:35,401
Look, Dixon, I don't have time

686
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:36,701
to deal with this right now, okay?

687
00:28:36,701 --> 00:28:38,000
Believe it or not, I actually have my own life.

688
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,667
Navid.
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

689
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:42,067
Nav...

690
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:44,234
Hey, Dixon?

691
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:47,900
Oh, baby, you don't gotta worry

692
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,734
I know how to change a tire...
What the hell is this?

693
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,167
Oh...

694
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,667
Why do you have a trunk full of porn?

695
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,334
What kind of pervert are you?

696
00:29:07,334 --> 00:29:08,501
I'm... I'm...

697
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:10,200
You have a trunk full of porn!

698
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,401
What were you going to do, go home
and watch a hundred movies?

699
00:29:12,401 --> 00:29:14,067
Sasha, no!
Then why do you have it?

700
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,067
You're clearly a pervert.

701
00:29:17,067 --> 00:29:19,134
I'm not...
Who else has all this?

702
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:21,267
People who... who are in the business.

703
00:29:21,267 --> 00:29:22,967
What?

704
00:29:22,967 --> 00:29:25,601
You're in the porn business?

705
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:29,734
Um...

706
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,734
Yeah.

707
00:29:31,734 --> 00:29:33,067
Oh!

708
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:35,967
Yeah, yeah, I... I am.

709
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:38,900
But not, not the perverted part,

710
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,234
more the money part, which is why

711
00:29:42,234 --> 00:29:44,134
I have all of this.

712
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:48,434
You said you were in the music business.

713
00:29:48,434 --> 00:29:49,933
Well, yeah, yeah.

714
00:29:49,933 --> 00:29:51,933
I mean, I'm... I'm trying to get into it.

715
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:54,933
But the point is... how I make my money.

716
00:29:56,601 --> 00:29:59,267
I... I'm trying to get out of it because, obviously,

717
00:29:59,267 --> 00:30:01,834
I'm pretty ashamed to even
be associated with the industry.

718
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:06,434
Look, I was really, really embarrassed,

719
00:30:06,434 --> 00:30:09,134
but I shouldn't have lied.

720
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:12,000
So I'm really sorry.

721
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,900
I feel like I don't know even know you.

722
00:30:16,434 --> 00:30:17,768
What else have you lied about?

723
00:30:17,768 --> 00:30:19,967
Nothing.
Nothing, nothing else.

724
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:22,033
I swear.

725
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:24,601
Everything else you know.

726
00:30:24,601 --> 00:30:26,501
You promise.

727
00:30:26,501 --> 00:30:27,634
No more lies?

728
00:30:27,634 --> 00:30:29,634
No more lies.

729
00:30:41,134 --> 00:30:45,200
Annie. Hey.

730
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,434
I just wanted to say thanks

731
00:30:47,434 --> 00:30:48,967
for coming to my uncle's memorial thing.

732
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:50,601
That was really cool of you.

733
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:52,467
Yeah, re.

734
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:54,401
What are you up to now?

735
00:30:54,401 --> 00:30:56,300
Oh, I'm just headed home.

736
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,067
I've got a bunch of homework, so...

737
00:30:58,067 --> 00:30:59,167
Homework?

738
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:01,701
The, uh, studious type?

739
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:05,334
Look, blow it off.

740
00:31:05,334 --> 00:31:07,334
What?

741
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:09,167
Blow off your homework.

742
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,734
Come take a ride with me.

743
00:31:10,734 --> 00:31:13,000
I, I can't. I should go.

744
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,134
That's all right.

745
00:31:17,134 --> 00:31:18,501
See you around?

746
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,801
Okay. Bye.

747
00:31:24,501 --> 00:31:28,701
Uh, I guess I just... needed to talk to someone.

748
00:31:28,701 --> 00:31:31,367
That's all.
What?

749
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:33,033
About my uncle.

750
00:31:34,801 --> 00:31:37,900
It's finally, I think, hitting me.

751
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:41,701
He died, that he's gone.

752
00:31:45,701 --> 00:31:47,900
I didn't know him the past couple years,

753
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,000
but when I was a kid...

754
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,167
we, uh, used to hang out all the time.

755
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:55,501
I remember he used to take me

756
00:31:55,501 --> 00:31:59,601
to the movies when I was,
like, two, on Sundays.

757
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:01,868
Sometimes we'd see three,

758
00:32:01,868 --> 00:32:03,967
four, in a row.

759
00:32:03,967 --> 00:32:06,933
He must've liked something

760
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:09,734
about the peace, you know, of a dark theater,

761
00:32:09,734 --> 00:32:11,868
but for me, it was just...

762
00:32:11,868 --> 00:32:13,267
I lived for those days.

763
00:32:14,734 --> 00:32:17,967
I don't know, I guess today just brought stuff up.

764
00:32:19,434 --> 00:32:22,100
But get on home. Do your homework.

765
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,033
I'll be fine.

766
00:32:24,033 --> 00:32:25,134
I'll see you.

767
00:32:25,134 --> 00:32:27,134
Jasper, wait.

768
00:32:27,134 --> 00:32:29,134
Um...

769
00:32:29,134 --> 00:32:31,567
I'll go for a ride with you.

770
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:33,134
You will?

771
00:32:33,134 --> 00:32:35,067
Cool.

772
00:32:35,067 --> 00:32:36,334
Come on.

773
00:32:42,234 --> 00:32:44,567
Hey, have you seen Teddy?

774
00:32:44,567 --> 00:32:46,134
I have to apologize to him.

775
00:32:46,134 --> 00:32:47,434
I haven't seen him.

776
00:32:47,434 --> 00:32:49,300
Everything okay, Navid?

777
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,801
Yeah, everything's fine.

778
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:51,967
Just fantastic.

779
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:58,933
Did you tell Naomi the truth?

780
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:02,067
Yes, did, actually.

781
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:07,100
I told her that I'm married and that I'm broke.

782
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,601
I really want to thank you,

783
00:33:09,601 --> 00:33:11,134
Liam, for forcing my hand.

784
00:33:11,134 --> 00:33:13,801
I feel so much better now
that Naomi knows everything.

785
00:33:13,801 --> 00:33:16,334
In fact, I feel free as a bird.

786
00:33:16,334 --> 00:33:17,868
But, I mean...

787
00:33:17,868 --> 00:33:20,267
Oh, easy does .

788
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:22,167
Let me know if you're going to have a fit

789
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,167
so I can look for a broomstick to put in your mouth.

790
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:26,801
Now, why don't you run along and

791
00:33:26,801 --> 00:33:29,134
look for some other girl to obsess over?

792
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:32,467
Naomi will never believe that we slept together.

793
00:33:51,067 --> 00:33:52,300
Hey.

794
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,401
Hey, you, you all right?

795
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:57,300
All right is relative,

796
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,300
right?

797
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
What's wrong?

798
00:34:08,134 --> 00:34:09,134
Okay.

799
00:34:10,501 --> 00:34:13,100
So I went on that audition
I was telling you about.

800
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,868
Yeah.

801
00:34:14,868 --> 00:34:17,868
I got the part.

802
00:34:17,868 --> 00:34:20,701
Ade, that's, that's great.

803
00:34:20,701 --> 00:34:21,701
Is it?

804
00:34:21,701 --> 00:34:23,234
What's the problem?

805
00:34:24,234 --> 00:34:27,434
I don't ow what I...

806
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:29,701
I don't know what I should do,

807
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:33,367
you know, 'cause I, I love acting.

808
00:34:33,367 --> 00:34:34,534
I love it.

809
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:38,334
I know. But maybe it is bad for me.

810
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:42,000
You know, I don't know if
I'm ready for that drama.

811
00:34:43,768 --> 00:34:45,801
What if I screw everything up again?

812
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:50,267
I'm scared.

813
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:52,100
Come here.

814
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:45,033
Um..

815
00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:47,567
We shouldn't have done that.

816
00:35:47,567 --> 00:35:49,667
Um...

817
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:51,367
I... I got to go.

818
00:35:58,434 --> 00:36:00,501
You know, those stars up there,

819
00:36:00,501 --> 00:36:02,767
they might not even exist.

820
00:36:02,767 --> 00:36:05,000
I mean, it takes so long

821
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,868
for the light to travel here

822
00:36:06,868 --> 00:36:09,767
that the stars themselves,
they could be gone now.

823
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:12,100
You know?

824
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,100
It's just, it's just weird

825
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,634
but they're like a message from back in time.

826
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:23,234
Yeah. I... I'm not sure
I even know what that means.

827
00:36:23,234 --> 00:36:26,601
Just that, that...

828
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,801
the universe is bigger than
we can imagine, you know?

829
00:36:29,801 --> 00:36:32,701
I guess it just kind of puts things in perspective.

830
00:36:32,701 --> 00:36:35,734
All the stuff that we think is so important,

831
00:36:35,734 --> 00:36:39,834
you know, in reality.. it's not.

832
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:41,734
It's nothing.

833
00:36:41,734 --> 00:36:43,901
Man, I wish that was true.

834
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:46,801
It is.

835
00:36:46,801 --> 00:36:50,534
Our planet, never mind our species,

836
00:36:50,534 --> 00:36:52,400
you and me... we're nothin.

837
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,734
We're like a blip in time.

838
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,434
You know, that's what my uncle was.

839
00:37:00,734 --> 00:37:02,501
You know, he was alive

840
00:37:02,501 --> 00:37:06,267
and now he's dead, but...

841
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:10,334
Maybe it's not that big of a deal, you know,

842
00:37:10,334 --> 00:37:12,000
in the scheme of the universe.

843
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,400
Do you really think that's true?

844
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,534
What will be will be, you know?

845
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:20,834
We're just pawns in the universe's game.

846
00:37:22,467 --> 00:37:24,133
We can't worry.

847
00:37:25,467 --> 00:37:29,734
We just have to lie back and enjoy the ride.

848
00:37:29,734 --> 00:37:31,801
Yeah.

849
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:52,968
174 Walden.

850
00:37:52,968 --> 00:37:54,467
It's a nice house.

851
00:37:54,467 --> 00:37:57,167
Yeah. Pretty traditional.

852
00:37:57,167 --> 00:38:00,167
I mean, not what you'd expect from a porn king.

853
00:38:00,167 --> 00:38:02,667
He's not a "porn king."

854
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:04,567
And I told you, he's getting out of it.

855
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:06,067
He just, he needed to make

856
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:07,334
some money to pay off some debt.

857
00:38:07,334 --> 00:38:08,968
But porn? I mean,

858
00:38:08,968 --> 00:38:10,567
that doesn't bother you at all?

859
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:12,634
I swear, if it were any other guy

860
00:38:12,634 --> 00:38:15,501
then, yeah, it probably would be a deal-breaker.

861
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,567
But Dixon is special.

862
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:21,501
He's sweet and understanding

863
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:24,300
and, oh, we have so much in common.

864
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,567
Oh, yes, the orange sherbert

865
00:38:26,567 --> 00:38:28,133
and Roy Campanella

866
00:38:28,133 --> 00:38:30,200
and you even have the same cell phone,

867
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,167
which is why you mixed them up.

868
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:33,467
How adorable.

869
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,601
I thought Dixon drove a Lamborghini.

870
00:38:45,601 --> 00:38:49,801
Well, he probably just has a few different cars.

871
00:38:53,267 --> 00:38:55,434
Who...?
Uh...

872
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:56,767
Who is that white woman

873
00:38:56,767 --> 00:39:00,534
and why is she hugging your boyfriend?

874
00:39:07,634 --> 00:39:10,167
Um, thanks for coming over.

875
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:11,701
Yeah.

876
00:39:11,701 --> 00:39:13,033
I wanted to tell you this in person.

877
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:14,467
Tell me what?

878
00:39:14,467 --> 00:39:17,234
Um...

879
00:39:17,234 --> 00:39:18,567
I turned down the part.

880
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:20,467
And my agent's

881
00:39:20,467 --> 00:39:22,734
dropping me, but it's fine.

882
00:39:22,734 --> 00:39:25,000
You know, I'm totally,

883
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I'm totally taking the year off.

884
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,634
We have been through so much.

885
00:39:31,634 --> 00:39:36,334
I just, I don't want any more
temptations right now.

886
00:39:40,534 --> 00:39:43,367
I love you so much, Ade.

887
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,601
I am so in love with you.

888
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,734
Um...

889
00:39:54,734 --> 00:39:57,601
So, my mom is working late tonight.

890
00:39:57,601 --> 00:40:00,267
We have the whole place to ourselves.

891
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,100
I think we've waited long enough,

892
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,267
don't you think?

893
00:40:08,834 --> 00:40:10,367
For...?

894
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:12,300
Yeah.

895
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,801
Yeah.

896
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:15,634
Yeah, uh-huh.

897
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,501
Champagne for no reason.

898
00:40:44,501 --> 00:40:46,968
Now, this is the kind of life
I always thought I'd live.

899
00:40:46,968 --> 00:40:49,133
Mm, who says that there's no reason?

900
00:40:49,133 --> 00:40:50,734
It's a Tuesday.

901
00:40:50,734 --> 00:40:52,167
Oh, yes.

902
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:54,834
Uh, Champagne Tuesday
at the Clark residence.

903
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:56,267
So, how was your day?

904
00:40:56,267 --> 00:40:59,000
Ugh, hideous.

905
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,400
High school kids are so annoying.

906
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,067
Naomi driving you up a wall?

907
00:41:06,501 --> 00:41:08,501
Something like that, yeah.

908
00:41:18,801 --> 00:41:22,167
Naomi will never believe that we slept together.
