1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,871
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,131 --> 00:00:04,374
Your mom called me, she has cancer.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,335
- Navid told me that you're a dealer.
- What?

4
00:00:07,595 --> 00:00:09,838
- You're pregnant.
- I'm gonna keep the baby.

5
00:00:10,098 --> 00:00:13,091
- 'Cause you have a huge crush on him.
- I don't.

6
00:00:15,728 --> 00:00:18,096
You're not pregnant.
Stay away from my son.

7
00:00:18,356 --> 00:00:20,223
- Dixon, are you okay?
- Sasha called.

8
00:00:20,483 --> 00:00:21,641
She had a miscarriage.

9
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:25,020
My mom died 3 years ago.
I knows what you're going through.

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,980
He propositionned me.

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,024
- Sorry I stormed off like that.
- You don't want to apologize

12
00:00:30,194 --> 00:00:31,882
- for hitting on my girlfriend?
- What?

13
00:00:32,052 --> 00:00:34,863
- You should go to a meeting.
- I just want the pain to stop.

14
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:37,023
Here you go.

15
00:00:38,418 --> 00:00:39,588
Thank you.

16
00:00:40,352 --> 00:00:41,411
Well, well.

17
00:00:42,684 --> 00:00:44,080
Open sesame.

18
00:00:51,787 --> 00:00:54,590
<i>Serena, we need
to reestablish Alpha Base...</i>

19
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,786
<i>before we can proceed
with the mission.</i>

20
00:00:59,999 --> 00:01:01,473
How you feeling?
Any better?

21
00:01:03,845 --> 00:01:06,218
I got some good news.
I talked to your coach.

22
00:01:06,388 --> 00:01:08,921
I explained you've been dealing
with a lot.

23
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:12,507
Threw around some pretty serious
principal rank, and guess what?

24
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,527
You're back on the surf team.

25
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:16,620
Thanks, but...

26
00:01:17,198 --> 00:01:18,615
I'm not going to go back.

27
00:01:19,027 --> 00:01:20,033
Why not?

28
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:24,996
Because I missed the practices,
so I should suffer the consequences.

29
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,040
There were extenuating
circumstances.

30
00:01:28,169 --> 00:01:29,605
Sasha was pregnant.

31
00:01:30,058 --> 00:01:32,545
And instead of supporting her,
I fought with her.

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,217
I've been trying to call her
and see if she's okay.

33
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:40,345
She hasn't returned any
of my phone calls.

34
00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:47,686
That's probably 'cause...
She's trying to move on.

35
00:01:48,614 --> 00:01:50,496
It's because she's devastated.

36
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:52,479
I know it.

37
00:01:54,502 --> 00:01:57,237
And I'm supposed to just go
on with my life like nothing happened?

38
00:01:59,108 --> 00:02:01,644
Just go surfing
while she's suffering.

39
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:04,475
How is that fair?

40
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,916
Thanks, but no thanks, Dad.

41
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,295
<i>The system is off-line and
a lockdown protocol is in effect.</i>

42
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:24,107
<i>If we rebuild,
the lockdown will end...</i>

43
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:26,959
Honey.

44
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:30,836
I'm really starting to worry
about Dixon. He seems miserable.

45
00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:33,947
He'd be more miserable
if he knew Sasha manipulated him

46
00:02:34,117 --> 00:02:35,150
and lied to him.

47
00:02:36,062 --> 00:02:38,194
He'd be heartbroken.
He'd feel like a fool.

48
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:40,697
- I don't know.
- I do.

49
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:42,574
I was right about Sasha, wasn't I?

50
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:45,097
- Yes, you were.
- So trust me.

51
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:47,957
It's only been a couple of days.
He'll snap out of it,

52
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:50,749
and then we can all just
move on and put this behind us.

53
00:02:54,262 --> 00:02:56,061
Rosie really wants...

54
00:02:57,292 --> 00:02:58,631
Blueberries.

55
00:02:59,037 --> 00:03:00,049
Excuse me?

56
00:03:03,327 --> 00:03:05,380
Rosie really wants blueberries.

57
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,931
Red, red, white, blue.

58
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:08,808
Of course.

59
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:11,010
Can't take it on
an empty stomach, though.

60
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,521
Here's some electrolytes.

61
00:03:14,864 --> 00:03:17,708
And while you drink that,
let's go over tomorrow's schedule.

62
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,350
All right.

63
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,340
The nurse is going to come

64
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,726
at 8:30 and it's Janet.
I know it's not her day,

65
00:03:25,896 --> 00:03:28,534
but I told Linda that she could
swap with her next tuesday.

66
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:32,215
Janet's gonna take
you to the oncologist at 11:00,

67
00:03:32,385 --> 00:03:33,958
which is all written here.

68
00:03:34,218 --> 00:03:37,486
You have a CBC to check your
platelets and your fibrinogen levels.

69
00:03:37,656 --> 00:03:39,931
And for medications for tomorrow,

70
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:42,614
everything is written here
according to what you take,

71
00:03:42,784 --> 00:03:44,924
what time and with or without food.

72
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:48,556
So if you have any questions
just refer to the binder. Sound good?

73
00:03:51,556 --> 00:03:52,560
What?

74
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,979
When did you get so organized?

75
00:03:56,925 --> 00:03:59,108
- I've always been organized.
- You?

76
00:04:01,385 --> 00:04:03,450
Remember in fifth grade,

77
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:06,407
I organized a class trip
to the San Diego Zoo.

78
00:04:08,586 --> 00:04:10,183
I passed around that petition

79
00:04:10,353 --> 00:04:13,248
listing all the reasons why
we deserved to go see the giant pandas.

80
00:04:17,475 --> 00:04:20,189
You've got to be organized
to be a stage manager.

81
00:04:24,837 --> 00:04:28,096
I did stage manage every school
play since like seventh grade.

82
00:04:28,859 --> 00:04:29,859
Sure.

83
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:38,527
The point is,
I'm organized, and it's helping now.

84
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:40,650
So, come on.

85
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,035
Rosie really wants her blueberries.

86
00:04:53,131 --> 00:04:57,083
This history homework is killing me.
I'm so over the Battle of the Bulge.

87
00:04:57,799 --> 00:05:01,254
If you were dating Jamie, you would
so not be over the Battle of the Bulge.

88
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,715
- You're disgusting.
- You're jealous.

89
00:05:04,566 --> 00:05:07,899
Jamie wants to know if I
can to to his frat party. No, right?

90
00:05:08,248 --> 00:05:09,334
You tell me.

91
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:12,361
It's your half-birthday.
What time is the party?

92
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:16,769
I'm not going to
have a half birthday party this year.

93
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,813
Everything going on with my mom,
there's just not a lot of time.

94
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:26,783
Look who's here.

95
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,616
Thank God.
I was getting worried.

96
00:05:30,425 --> 00:05:32,103
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, you.

97
00:05:32,273 --> 00:05:33,411
How you holding up?

98
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,081
I'm actually doing a lot better.

99
00:05:37,706 --> 00:05:39,167
That's good.
That's so good.

100
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,586
I'm sorry I was such a mess.

101
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:43,434
Are you kidding?

102
00:05:43,604 --> 00:05:45,195
You had every right to be a mess.

103
00:05:45,955 --> 00:05:49,242
You made a stupid mistake,
and you lost the guy you loved, and...

104
00:05:49,412 --> 00:05:51,908
- I am not helping. I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

105
00:05:52,078 --> 00:05:53,175
I'm okay.

106
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,956
That's good, Ade.
And it's good to see you.

107
00:05:56,126 --> 00:05:57,644
I'll see you all at lunch?

108
00:06:01,345 --> 00:06:03,941
- How's she doing?
- I don't know

109
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:08,237
She says she's okay, but she doesn't
want to celebrate her half-birthday.

110
00:06:08,497 --> 00:06:09,497
What?

111
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:12,909
That would probably help
her take her mind off her mom.

112
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:14,169
Right?

113
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,597
Whatever. I'm not done
working on her.

114
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:19,624
No matter what, we have to
get her a gift. Maybe a massage.

115
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:21,311
That sounds perfect.

116
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,505
But I'm actually running
a little low on funds.

117
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:27,245
Don't even worry about it.

118
00:06:27,415 --> 00:06:29,592
Pick up the gift
certificate, we'll call it even.

119
00:06:31,395 --> 00:06:33,471
- What do you think?
- That's so cute.

120
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:35,098
It's silly.

121
00:06:35,358 --> 00:06:37,976
- "Happy Half-Birthday."
- $150... that should do it, right?

122
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,730
- Perfect.
- Good to have you back, Ade.

123
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,857
It's really good to be back.

124
00:06:52,021 --> 00:06:53,616
I want to talk to you.

125
00:06:53,786 --> 00:06:55,062
I didn't hit on Jen.

126
00:06:55,232 --> 00:06:57,673
And honestly,
that woman is a psychotic bitch.

127
00:06:57,843 --> 00:06:59,744
- Enough.
- She is.

128
00:06:59,914 --> 00:07:03,470
You know what, I'm starting
to think your stepdad was right, okay?

129
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:05,336
Maybe you are a bad seed.

130
00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:19,605
John Campos dares me to eat
ten packets of butter this morning.

131
00:07:20,152 --> 00:07:22,394
Don't mean to brag, but I ate 11.

132
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:25,898
The kid had five. I swear he
was gonna hurl all over the cafeteria.

133
00:07:26,474 --> 00:07:27,582
That's great.

134
00:07:28,165 --> 00:07:29,934
- Is everything okay?
- Just fine.

135
00:07:30,104 --> 00:07:32,011
Really? 'Cause you don't seem fine.

136
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:33,735
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

137
00:07:33,905 --> 00:07:35,908
Obviously it's something.
What's going on?

138
00:07:37,861 --> 00:07:39,175
What is it?

139
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:41,122
Just back off.

140
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:44,292
You're not my girlfriend.

141
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,963
Another reason to have
your half-birthday soiree...

142
00:07:49,223 --> 00:07:52,282
I just bought a ridiculously hot dress,
and you'll get to see me in it.

143
00:07:52,452 --> 00:07:53,968
Tempting, but I'll pass.

144
00:07:54,873 --> 00:07:56,112
Pass on what?

145
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:58,723
Seeing Naomi look ridiculously hot.

146
00:07:58,983 --> 00:08:00,487
Silver's half-birthday party,

147
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:03,181
which she's trying to
cancel for the first time in years.

148
00:08:04,604 --> 00:08:06,166
I got to go.
Jamie's here.

149
00:08:06,336 --> 00:08:08,135
Just promise you'll think about it.

150
00:08:08,305 --> 00:08:09,619
My dress is...

151
00:08:10,502 --> 00:08:13,599
Picture lots of cleavage, excellent ass.
It's amazing.

152
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:17,033
We'll find another occasion for it.
Maybe bowling or something.

153
00:08:20,026 --> 00:08:22,045
Half-birthday party?

154
00:08:22,215 --> 00:08:24,203
You so don't seem
like the type of person

155
00:08:24,373 --> 00:08:26,125
that would make
a big deal out of it.

156
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,503
It's a long story.

157
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,504
It's a long walk to class.

158
00:08:37,987 --> 00:08:39,555
For my tenth birthday,

159
00:08:40,342 --> 00:08:43,686
... all my friends and I were
gonna go camping in my backyard.

160
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,518
I was super excited.

161
00:08:46,631 --> 00:08:48,523
Counting the days excited.

162
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:51,811
And then on my birthday

163
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:55,079
my mom got trashed
and I had to cancel the party.

164
00:08:56,212 --> 00:08:57,782
She'd missed birthdays before...

165
00:08:58,132 --> 00:09:01,102
she'd gotten drunk
or just forgotten...

166
00:09:03,138 --> 00:09:05,747
but, this one,
this was the last straw.

167
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,599
I just gave up on birthdays
in general.

168
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:10,962
- Too many expectations.
- And half-birthdays?

169
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,882
If you don't have high expectations
then you can't get let down.

170
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:20,975
What does one get a person
for their half-birthday present?

171
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:23,812
A half-DVD?
Just special features?

172
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:25,643
A half-bottle of champagne?

173
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:27,436
I know.

174
00:09:27,696 --> 00:09:28,813
A half-bikini.

175
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Perv.

176
00:09:31,643 --> 00:09:32,733
All right.

177
00:09:33,672 --> 00:09:36,611
How about a half-spring break trip?

178
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:39,907
It wouldn't be so bad.
A one-way trip to Cabo.

179
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:42,775
<i>Despite the recent overdose
at Malibu Canyon High,</i>

180
00:09:42,945 --> 00:09:45,424
<i>the students are seemingly
apathetic.</i>

181
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,292
Teen drug use has reared
its ugly head at West Bev before.

182
00:09:49,803 --> 00:09:52,245
<i>Was the case at Malibu Canyon
an isolated incident,</i>

183
00:09:52,415 --> 00:09:54,695
or an indication of a larger,
yet uncovered problem

184
00:09:54,865 --> 00:09:57,241
plaguing the Los Angeles
school system?

185
00:10:00,376 --> 00:10:02,912
I don't think we've officially met.

186
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,350
I'm Navid.

187
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:09,604
Why would you tell Annie
I'm a drug dealer?

188
00:10:11,124 --> 00:10:13,482
- That's what I heard.
- From who?

189
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:17,778
A friend of mine.
She said you sold to a friend of hers.

190
00:10:18,038 --> 00:10:20,281
I assume you didn't talk
to this friend of a friend?

191
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:21,657
No, but...

192
00:10:22,394 --> 00:10:25,772
'Cause if you did, you would
have realized that it's not true.

193
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:30,291
Don't you check your sources
before you publish your stories?

194
00:10:30,551 --> 00:10:32,177
- Of course.
- Of course you do?

195
00:10:32,344 --> 00:10:34,378
I wish you'd give me the
same respect.

196
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:43,095
For the record,
I'm not a drug dealer.

197
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:46,005
I'm just a guy who doesn't have
a lot of friends here.

198
00:10:46,175 --> 00:10:47,861
Never have.
I'm not a popular kid,

199
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:50,519
and because of that, people like
to spread rumors about me.

200
00:10:51,323 --> 00:10:53,584
I guess I should be
used to it by now.

201
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:56,303
People gossiping, but...

202
00:10:58,235 --> 00:10:59,987
It still feels crappy.

Season 02 episode 09
<i>A Trip to the Moon</i>

205
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:32,853
Hey, you.
I missed you all morning.

206
00:11:33,522 --> 00:11:34,939
I missed you, too.

207
00:11:35,852 --> 00:11:38,109
- You want to go to Quality for lunch?
- Sounds good.

208
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:42,060
I have some pretty big news.

209
00:11:42,804 --> 00:11:44,657
Really?
What?

210
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:47,533
How do you think we
should get to Quality?

211
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,344
Beverly or Burton?

212
00:11:49,514 --> 00:11:53,183
I was thinking Beverly, but Beverly
can get so busy this time of day, so...

213
00:11:53,353 --> 00:11:56,085
Then, let's take Burton.
What's the big news?

214
00:11:56,345 --> 00:11:59,952
Sometimes I take Olympic...
once in a while... and it's like

215
00:12:00,555 --> 00:12:03,134
- smooth sailing, completely.
- What's the news?

216
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,389
That?

217
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:10,349
I cut a few scenes together from
my movie and showed it to my father.

218
00:12:10,609 --> 00:12:12,988
Granted, the guy, he
produces big-budget movies,

219
00:12:13,158 --> 00:12:15,078
most of
which are completely soulless.

220
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:16,600
- But?
- But still...

221
00:12:17,957 --> 00:12:20,401
He... responded to it.
He liked it.

222
00:12:23,216 --> 00:12:26,219
- That's great.
- But that's not even the best part.

223
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:28,276
- What?
- There's a Shia LeBeouf movie.

224
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:30,619
There's a small part.
My dad's producing.

225
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:32,455
And I got you an audition.

226
00:12:33,892 --> 00:12:36,572
- My God. Are you serious?
- I'm dead serious.

227
00:12:38,622 --> 00:12:40,349
You just have to promise me

228
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:43,758
that when you're a big movie star,
you'll still have time for me.

229
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:46,229
I promise.
'Cause, after all,

230
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,429
I'll still need someone
to get me coffee.

231
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:55,750
- What up, guys?
- What's up?

232
00:12:56,739 --> 00:12:58,151
Where's Liam?
Is he coming?

233
00:12:58,321 --> 00:13:01,233
Don't know. He was in a nasty mood.
Bit my head off earlier.

234
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:04,236
Is it true you downed, like ten
butter packets this morning?

235
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,903
- 11, actually.
- Eleven?

236
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,658
What do you
guys think's going on with him?

237
00:13:09,918 --> 00:13:11,308
Who knows?

238
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:13,079
We've got curly fries.

239
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:15,533
I'm more of a tater tot man, myself.

240
00:13:15,703 --> 00:13:18,000
You can't say tater tot
and man in the same sentence.

241
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,710
Did you ask him what was wrong?

242
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,840
- Why not?
- Liam's not the 

243
00:13:25,007 --> 00:13:26,799
"talk about
your feelings" kind of guy.

244
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:28,636
What if something's actually wrong?

245
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:31,327
I haven't smelled dead
bodies coming from his car.

246
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:34,100
- That is a good sign.
- This isn't a joke.

247
00:13:35,183 --> 00:13:37,606
He's obviously really
upset about something.

248
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,378
It's sad that the people
who are supposed to be his friends

249
00:13:40,548 --> 00:13:42,539
don't even really seem to care.

250
00:13:43,494 --> 00:13:44,512
Excuse me.

251
00:13:47,554 --> 00:13:49,962
I swear, every year, I
forget about the Santa Anas

252
00:13:50,132 --> 00:13:51,784
and then one morning,
I'll wake up...

253
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:54,495
And I'm boring you.

254
00:13:58,717 --> 00:14:00,180
Maybe a little.

255
00:14:01,178 --> 00:14:02,958
I'm sorry. I'm nervous.

256
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:06,882
I know that you saw me with
Teddy, and I wanted to explain.

257
00:14:07,142 --> 00:14:08,996
I wanted to talk to you about it,

258
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:11,470
but since your break-up,

259
00:14:12,104 --> 00:14:13,681
the timing wasn't right.

260
00:14:16,485 --> 00:14:19,127
Teddy and I are...
We sort of...

261
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:22,671
We're friends and I feel
so badly about that

262
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:25,602
because of everything that happened
between you two, but his mom...

263
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,324
She had cancer, too,

264
00:14:27,494 --> 00:14:29,196
and he's been really helpful.

265
00:14:30,624 --> 00:14:32,505
Sorry that I didn't tell you sooner,

266
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:36,713
but if you don't want me to be friends,
then I won't.

267
00:14:36,883 --> 00:14:39,957
That's what I'll do. I will
stop being friends with him.

268
00:14:41,877 --> 00:14:43,794
I just want you to be happy.

269
00:14:44,388 --> 00:14:48,033
If being friends with Teddy
is going to help you deal with your mom,

270
00:14:48,945 --> 00:14:50,509
- go for it.
- Really?

271
00:14:51,402 --> 00:14:52,761
Really. I'm fine.

272
00:14:53,469 --> 00:14:56,223
- Ade, thank you. Thank you.
- Of course.

273
00:14:56,871 --> 00:14:59,915
I'll be right back.
I got to go to the bathroom.

274
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,694
There's no way that your office
can deliver the records to our house?

275
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,475
That's okay.
I'll figure it out.

276
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,897
I don't usually do home deliveries,
so this will be extra.

277
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:47,693
Your homework.

278
00:15:48,272 --> 00:15:50,012
And a black coffee.

279
00:15:50,415 --> 00:15:52,427
Thank you so much. I needed this.

280
00:15:53,193 --> 00:15:54,406
Everything okay?

281
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,919
My mom has to see this new doctor
and she needs her medical records,

282
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:05,251
- but her nurse had an emergency.
- I'll pick them up.

283
00:16:05,894 --> 00:16:08,254
That's sweet, but you can't.
I have to sign for them.

284
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:12,383
Then I'll stay here with your
mom while you go pick up her records.

285
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:14,660
I don't...

286
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,168
I have plenty of experience
with sick moms.

287
00:16:17,338 --> 00:16:18,889
Trust me.
I got it covered.

288
00:16:20,957 --> 00:16:22,178
30 minutes?

289
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:25,980
- Thank you so much.
- I'll just add it to your tab.

290
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:32,348
You okay?

291
00:16:36,349 --> 00:16:37,720
Thinking about Sasha?

292
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:43,215
I just wish she knew how sorry I am.

293
00:16:44,435 --> 00:16:45,609
I hear you.

294
00:16:49,282 --> 00:16:51,103
Speaking of apologies...

295
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:52,935
Catch you later.

296
00:17:03,603 --> 00:17:05,060
Fancy meeting you here.

297
00:17:07,714 --> 00:17:10,858
I want the same stuff I got last time,
but I only have 20.

298
00:17:13,203 --> 00:17:16,508
Could you just sell me a few pills
now and then I'll buy the rest later?

299
00:17:16,678 --> 00:17:19,325
Sorry, this isn't
an a la carte service.

300
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:21,976
- Call me when you have the money.
- Wait...

301
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:34,423
Here.

302
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:39,011
That's more like it.
You know where to find me.

303
00:18:06,437 --> 00:18:08,387
Really? So you don't like it.

304
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,603
Not this time.
You going to take it?

305
00:18:11,389 --> 00:18:14,493
I think I will take my
chances on lady luck.

306
00:18:14,915 --> 00:18:16,821
And it's a good thing I did.

307
00:18:16,988 --> 00:18:19,390
Careful there.
Your suits are showing.

308
00:18:21,876 --> 00:18:24,822
You're throwing down a six?
Bad move.

309
00:18:25,892 --> 00:18:28,844
- Next hand, double or nothing.
- You are on, sucker.

310
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:32,361
- Hey, you.
- Your mom is going down.

311
00:18:37,973 --> 00:18:40,362
- No way!
- How's that for bringing it, hmm?

312
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:41,879
What you got now?

313
00:18:58,212 --> 00:18:59,221
Hello?

314
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:02,444
It's...

315
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:05,106
- I know.
- Right.

316
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:12,276
I didn't think you'd be calling.

317
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:15,463
- But I'm glad.
- Ade, I saw you buying drugs today.

318
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:17,829
What?

319
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:20,343
- Why would you start using again?
- I'm not.

320
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,710
I saw you in your car with Jasper.

321
00:19:22,877 --> 00:19:26,123
Look. Whatever you think you saw,
you were wrong.

322
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,973
- Ade, are you serious right now?
- Why are you even calling?

323
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,055
I thought
I wasn't your problem anymore.

324
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,855
Come on.
I still care about you, okay?

325
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:53,818
I'll be back in about an hour.
I got to go run by Sasha's.

326
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:54,985
What?

327
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,569
I just want to go over there
and make sure she's okay.

328
00:19:57,736 --> 00:19:59,121
Apologize face to face.

329
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,950
I don't think that's a good idea.

330
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:06,484
You know, it may not be,
but I still got to try.

331
00:20:06,651 --> 00:20:09,082
You know, I got to let her
know that I'm here for her.

332
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:13,547
Well, that's all well and good,
but I think it's obvious

333
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:16,465
that Sasha doesn't want
to see you right now.

334
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,973
Because I was being a jerk
and I made her feel like she was alone,

335
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,929
- which is why I have to go apologize.
- But now is not the time.

336
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,346
We're about to sit down for dinner.

337
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,894
Okay, fine. Then I'll go after.

338
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,480
What? Why are you guys making
such a big deal out of this?

339
00:20:35,356 --> 00:20:38,841
Dixon, sit down.
I have something to tell you.

340
00:20:47,991 --> 00:20:49,873
Sasha didn't have a miscarriage.

341
00:20:50,989 --> 00:20:52,000
What?

342
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:54,753
She wasn't pregnant.

343
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:01,539
I don't understand.
What are you talking about?

344
00:21:02,987 --> 00:21:04,646
I had some suspicions.

345
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:07,213
A lot of what she said
didn't add up,

346
00:21:07,835 --> 00:21:10,935
so I went to see her
and I caught her in some lies.

347
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:14,231
I guess she said she had
a miscarriage to save face.

348
00:21:17,206 --> 00:21:19,256
So, she wasn't really pregnant?

349
00:21:22,054 --> 00:21:23,304
No, she wasn't.

350
00:21:24,196 --> 00:21:26,410
Wait. And you guys knew
about this all along?

351
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,982
Look, your father
wanted to tell you, but I...

352
00:21:29,297 --> 00:21:30,873
I wanted to protect you.

353
00:21:31,401 --> 00:21:34,293
I didn't want you to get
your heart broken and not trust women.

354
00:21:37,192 --> 00:21:38,192
Well...

355
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,375
Now I know one woman I can't trust.

356
00:21:57,023 --> 00:21:58,724
No, it doesn't hurt.

357
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:02,686
Why should it?
Go, go, have a great time.

358
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:04,489
I couldn't care less.

359
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,323
That was great.

360
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:08,018
You are incredible.

361
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,367
That's a lie.
I know I'm not great.

362
00:22:11,534 --> 00:22:14,333
I wish you could see yourself
the way that I see you.

363
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,960
You'd never have a moment
of self-doubt ever.

364
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:19,625
No, I'm serious.

365
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,300
You're beautiful, talented, soulful.

366
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,484
Sometimes I just,

367
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:30,641
I can't believe how lucky
I am to have found you.

368
00:22:35,894 --> 00:22:37,773
Okay, back to work.

369
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,450
Where were we?

370
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,665
"But I won't have a
great time without you.

371
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:45,501
"Don't you understand?

372
00:22:45,904 --> 00:22:48,004
I'm asking you to come with me."

373
00:22:50,796 --> 00:22:51,846
I love you.

374
00:22:53,521 --> 00:22:55,137
That's not your line.

375
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:56,304
I know.

376
00:23:01,776 --> 00:23:05,355
Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have said anything.

377
00:23:05,522 --> 00:23:07,665
Clearly, you don't feel
the same way.

378
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,596
No, Annie...

379
00:23:11,412 --> 00:23:14,226
It's just that I wanted
to be the one who said it first.

380
00:23:35,755 --> 00:23:36,851
You scumbag.

381
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:39,385
Good morning to you, too, man.

382
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:41,920
I saw you with Ade.
I saw you selling to her.

383
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,290
- Whatever you think you saw...
- No, you went into her car,

384
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,797
and you came out with cash.
What else did I have to see?

385
00:23:47,964 --> 00:23:49,480
I spotted her lunch money.

386
00:23:49,647 --> 00:23:52,264
Told her it was on me.
She insisted she pay me back.

387
00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:56,101
She's a nice girl.
Why'd you two break up?

388
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,186
You just stay the hell
away from her.

389
00:23:58,436 --> 00:23:59,493
Or what?

390
00:24:00,452 --> 00:24:02,669
I'll say it one last time:
I'm not a drug dealer.

391
00:24:04,127 --> 00:24:06,485
But if I was, I wouldn't be
the kind of guy you'd want

392
00:24:06,652 --> 00:24:09,882
- to mess with, would I?
- You threatening me?

393
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,749
Not at all. Like I said,
not a drug dealer.

394
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,416
Who are those guys?

395
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,807
I don't know. They must've heard
the waves are breaking out here.

396
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,980
This is our beach.
Better not get in our way.

397
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:43,982
- Dude, chill.
- You chill.

398
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:48,386
And can you not use all my wax?

399
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,743
Yo, everything okay, man?

400
00:24:55,316 --> 00:24:57,329
Yes! I'm fine.

401
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:04,171
I tried.

402
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,598
Silver? I'm in here.

403
00:25:24,563 --> 00:25:26,316
Happy Birthday!

404
00:25:27,702 --> 00:25:29,569
What? I don't understand.

405
00:25:30,348 --> 00:25:33,573
I missed so many of your birthdays,
I wanted to make it up to you

406
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,764
before it was too late. So, welcome.
You're seven, by the way.

407
00:25:36,931 --> 00:25:39,162
When I wanted to be an astronaut.

408
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,290
Now come here.

409
00:25:49,986 --> 00:25:53,468
Oh, my God, a fishbowl space helmet?
Really?

410
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:54,719
Put it on.

411
00:25:55,085 --> 00:25:57,584
You might not think this is
as exciting at my age,

412
00:25:57,751 --> 00:25:59,361
but it totally is!

413
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,685
Would you like a glass of Tang?

414
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:06,106
Kinda hard to drink
through the helmet.

415
00:26:06,418 --> 00:26:09,651
Now I'm not sure the
constellations are accurate.

416
00:26:11,718 --> 00:26:12,821
It's incredible!

417
00:26:13,151 --> 00:26:15,031
There's so much more to see.

418
00:26:15,622 --> 00:26:17,172
There's more? Are...?

419
00:26:18,518 --> 00:26:19,536
Like I said,

420
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,329
I missed a lot of birthdays.

421
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:34,018
I must be 12, when I was
obsessed with the '80s.

422
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:39,764
Oh, radical, dude! Yes!

423
00:26:40,014 --> 00:26:42,559
How did you do all this, Mom?

424
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:46,701
I had a little help from the nurses.
But the biggest help was Teddy.

425
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,297
He was here for hours
with one of his dad's

426
00:26:49,464 --> 00:26:51,818
fancy-schmancy set designer friends.

427
00:26:53,931 --> 00:26:57,490
I mean, this is...
This is all so, so wow.

428
00:27:15,184 --> 00:27:17,184
I understand why you're upset.

429
00:27:17,884 --> 00:27:19,584
My intentions were good,

430
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:22,608
but, but obviously, I was wrong.

431
00:27:29,283 --> 00:27:30,783
I can't believe you.

432
00:27:33,873 --> 00:27:35,118
Dixon, please?

433
00:27:35,584 --> 00:27:37,785
Dixon, stop.
I just want to talk to you.

434
00:27:39,151 --> 00:27:41,390
Come on. I know
you're upset with your mom.

435
00:27:41,557 --> 00:27:44,162
Whatever...
It's not like she's my real mom.

436
00:27:57,731 --> 00:28:01,337
So, what made you want
a camping party in the first place?

437
00:28:02,064 --> 00:28:03,431
Horror movies.

438
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:08,103
In every good horror movie
there's always a scary camping scene.

439
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,025
I'll never understand where you got
your love of being terrified.

440
00:28:15,124 --> 00:28:17,109
It gets you out
of your head, you know?

441
00:28:17,276 --> 00:28:19,141
I mean, the scarier the movie,

442
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:21,741
the more I could just forget
all my problems.

443
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:24,809
Me...

444
00:28:27,556 --> 00:28:28,556
You...

445
00:28:29,137 --> 00:28:30,667
You were just never there.

446
00:28:32,955 --> 00:28:34,205
Which was hard.

447
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,780
You not coming to the plays
that I stage-managed...

448
00:28:39,943 --> 00:28:43,193
Worrying about you when
you didn't come home at night,

449
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,056
just hoping that you were okay.

450
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:47,687
Honey, I am so sorry.

451
00:28:49,332 --> 00:28:51,532
Which makes up for nothing, but...

452
00:28:53,224 --> 00:28:54,324
No, it does.

453
00:28:58,449 --> 00:28:59,697
This does.

454
00:29:01,776 --> 00:29:03,526
I was so scared that you,

455
00:29:05,781 --> 00:29:07,078
that you would die

456
00:29:08,162 --> 00:29:11,668
and I wouldn't have
anything good to hold onto.

457
00:29:13,814 --> 00:29:14,964
And now I do.

458
00:29:15,995 --> 00:29:19,132
Now I have my tenth birthday party
where we went camping.

459
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,027
Oh, honey...

460
00:29:28,884 --> 00:29:31,236
Enough of this sappiness.
Eat your marshmallow.

461
00:29:31,582 --> 00:29:33,438
Just remember to save your appetite.

462
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,191
Tomorrow is your official
half-birthday.

463
00:29:37,648 --> 00:29:40,543
All your friends are coming over
for a big barbecue.

464
00:29:40,922 --> 00:29:42,280
Are you serious?

465
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,776
You've been celebrating
your half-birthday for years,

466
00:29:44,943 --> 00:29:47,327
and I am glad that I finally
get to be a part of it.

467
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,680
Me, too!

468
00:29:50,543 --> 00:29:52,345
Cheers!
Awesome.

469
00:29:58,239 --> 00:30:00,215
Hey! Didn't think you'd make it.

470
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:02,869
You've been a little M.I.A. lately.

471
00:30:03,036 --> 00:30:06,098
I get alerts on my phone that
let me know how the waves are breaking.

472
00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:08,864
So you know I couldn't resist
when I heard about these swells.

473
00:30:09,772 --> 00:30:12,268
Plus, you know, I just had
to get out of the house.

474
00:30:12,797 --> 00:30:14,347
Everything okay, man?

475
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,650
Turns out Sasha wasn't
really pregnant.

476
00:30:19,955 --> 00:30:20,955
What?

477
00:30:22,172 --> 00:30:24,572
She lied about the whole thing.

478
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:28,785
I wish I'd get alerts that let me know
when crazy girls are approaching.

479
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:31,650
They probably got an app for that.

480
00:30:32,022 --> 00:30:33,706
And I bet it beeps nonstop.

481
00:30:34,274 --> 00:30:35,959
What the hell, man?!

482
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:39,629
- You tell me, dude. That was my wave.
- Like hell it was. Don't push me!

483
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,384
Come on!

484
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:48,647
- Get off me! He's a punk!
- We're leaving.

485
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:50,765
- No, we're not.
- Yes, we are.

486
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,915
Dude, what the hell?
Relax!

487
00:31:04,977 --> 00:31:07,403
- What was that back there?
- That guy was being a jerk!

488
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,834
You were the jerk!
What the hell's going on, man!

489
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,504
- Nothing.
- It's not nothing.

490
00:31:11,671 --> 00:31:14,826
You nearly got us in a fight back there,
and you're gonna tell us why.

491
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:16,614
Back off, man.

492
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,680
Or what? You gonna hit me?

493
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:23,275
Try it. You can't take
both of us down.

494
00:31:23,442 --> 00:31:24,883
Make that all three of us.

495
00:31:25,887 --> 00:31:28,397
- What is your problem?
- We don't have a problem.

496
00:31:28,564 --> 00:31:30,349
Liam, we're your friends.

497
00:31:30,778 --> 00:31:33,264
Friends tell each other
what the hell is going on.

498
00:31:33,431 --> 00:31:35,935
So come on. What
the hell's going on?

499
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:41,941
Someone's been telling lies
about me, all right?

500
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,087
- Who, Liam?
- Jen, Naomi's sister.

501
00:31:57,193 --> 00:31:59,834
That super hot Amazon chick
from the N.E.R.D. party?

502
00:32:01,007 --> 00:32:03,624
- Sorry, she wasn't that hot.
- What'd she say?

503
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:05,701
She told Matthews that I hit on her.

504
00:32:05,868 --> 00:32:08,245
She told my mother
that I was stalking Naomi.

505
00:32:08,412 --> 00:32:10,153
- All sorts of stuff.
- What?

506
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,764
- Why?
- Forget about it.

507
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:15,048
We'll wait you out, man.

508
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:18,499
And believe me,
we can wait all night.

509
00:32:19,074 --> 00:32:20,474
Tell us why, dude.

510
00:32:25,298 --> 00:32:28,349
Last year, at the after-prom party,

511
00:32:28,749 --> 00:32:30,649
she was the person that I...

512
00:32:32,497 --> 00:32:33,997
That I had sex with.

513
00:32:34,998 --> 00:32:36,913
So, wait, so, so, it wasn't Annie?

514
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:40,291
- I told you it wasn't.
- I know, but I still thought...

515
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,936
- You had sex with Naomi's sister?
- It wasn't like that.

516
00:32:43,103 --> 00:32:45,970
She told me she was her neighbor.
She's full of lies, this woman,

517
00:32:46,137 --> 00:32:48,299
and she's be trying to destroy me
since last year.

518
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,705
- That's messed up.
- I'm gonna destroy Jen

519
00:32:50,872 --> 00:32:52,522
before she destroys me.

520
00:32:53,651 --> 00:32:56,101
I just don't know how
I'm gonna do it.

521
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,924
It's not how you're gonna do it...

522
00:32:59,697 --> 00:33:01,547
It's how we're gonna do it.

523
00:33:05,763 --> 00:33:06,813
Hell, yeah.

524
00:33:07,057 --> 00:33:09,464
That Amazon bitch ain't
gonna know what hit her.

525
00:33:09,631 --> 00:33:11,573
Get her right in the kneecaps.

526
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:15,118
You guys, you...
You don't have to do this.

527
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,118
We know we don't have to.

528
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,930
But we're your friends, remember?

529
00:33:26,183 --> 00:33:27,283
Later, Liam.

530
00:33:50,247 --> 00:33:51,321
What's wrong?

531
00:33:52,443 --> 00:33:55,143
I just got the call;
I didn't get the part.

532
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:57,864
My dad is such an idiot.

533
00:34:00,693 --> 00:34:03,416
I know you were so much
better than all those other girls.

534
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,793
Apparently not.

535
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:08,093
You ever hear of Johnny Weissmuller?

536
00:34:08,748 --> 00:34:10,485
No? Exactly.

537
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:14,344
But Clark Gable, he lost
the role of Tarzan to him.

538
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,264
You will get your part, Jane.

539
00:34:19,194 --> 00:34:21,480
- Maybe.
- No maybe.

540
00:34:22,273 --> 00:34:23,273
You will.

541
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,439
You're a star.
You're an old-fashioned star.

542
00:34:27,403 --> 00:34:29,703
You're so talented, it's incredible.

543
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,750
Not to mention beautiful.

544
00:34:34,261 --> 00:34:36,240
You're an extraordinary
person, Annie.

545
00:34:36,731 --> 00:34:39,531
You're so vulnerable
and yet so strong and...

546
00:34:39,897 --> 00:34:42,664
So innocent, but also wise.

547
00:34:45,265 --> 00:34:46,815
I mean, you're Annie.

548
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:51,797
Thank you.

549
00:35:02,552 --> 00:35:03,602
I love you.

550
00:35:04,518 --> 00:35:05,770
I love you, too.

551
00:35:07,408 --> 00:35:08,408
And...

552
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:13,545
And I... I want my first
time to be with you.

553
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,621
Are you sure that you're ready?

554
00:35:18,001 --> 00:35:19,001
Positive.

555
00:35:58,797 --> 00:36:01,175
So, look...

556
00:36:02,379 --> 00:36:03,945
I owe you an apology.

557
00:36:04,112 --> 00:36:06,583
Dude, I totally get
why you snapped at me.

558
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,051
- You've obviously had a lot going on.
- About what I said in the hall.

559
00:36:10,218 --> 00:36:11,878
About you not being my girlfriend.

560
00:36:16,544 --> 00:36:19,294
I know you don't think
you're my girlfriend.

561
00:36:20,184 --> 00:36:23,014
No kidding. We're just having fun,
dude, that's all.

562
00:36:27,193 --> 00:36:29,398
- So we're cool?
- Yeah. Totally.

563
00:36:30,064 --> 00:36:31,064
Good.

564
00:36:32,967 --> 00:36:35,109
Hey, do you maybe want
to grab something to eat?

565
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,279
See who can scarf down
the most ketchup packets?

566
00:36:40,326 --> 00:36:41,326
Cute.

567
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:43,783
Maybe another time.

568
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:45,903
All right.

569
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,240
Catch you later.

570
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:55,838
You know what? I'm pretty hungry,
so what the hell?

571
00:36:59,902 --> 00:37:01,752
What a you in the mood for?

572
00:37:02,032 --> 00:37:03,039
Tacos.

573
00:37:03,206 --> 00:37:04,806
Really?
Tacos and ketchup?

574
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,158
Thanks, anyway.

575
00:37:28,284 --> 00:37:29,650
No luck, boss.

576
00:37:29,817 --> 00:37:33,171
I just talked to my friend, the one
who said she bought drugs from Jasper,

577
00:37:33,338 --> 00:37:36,087
- and she won't help us.
- We have to find a way to prove it.

578
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,005
I want to bring this dirtbag down.

579
00:38:16,217 --> 00:38:18,267
Look, I just came to apologize.

580
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:20,516
I should have trusted you
when you told me...

581
00:38:20,683 --> 00:38:23,549
Is this about the fact
that you called Jasper sketchy?

582
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:26,470
Actually.

583
00:38:27,444 --> 00:38:28,644
Of course not.

584
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,810
Whatever. I don't even know
why I care what you think.

585
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,605
You're clearly not
a very good judge of character.

586
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,399
What's that supposed to mean?

587
00:38:39,207 --> 00:38:42,716
I don't know.
Your girlfriend faked a miscarriage.

588
00:38:42,883 --> 00:38:44,655
Sounds like a real winner.

589
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,919
Go to hell.

590
00:39:14,547 --> 00:39:15,947
Hey, what's wrong?

591
00:39:17,592 --> 00:39:18,719
I went to

592
00:39:18,886 --> 00:39:21,682
the spa to buy the gift certificate
for Silver,

593
00:39:22,716 --> 00:39:24,284
and I got out of my car,

594
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,117
and out of nowhere,
there was this guy.

595
00:39:29,399 --> 00:39:30,701
And he grabbed my purse.

596
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,495
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

597
00:39:35,084 --> 00:39:37,584
He took everything.
You know, my credit cards,

598
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:39,627
the money for
Silver's gift, everything.

599
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:43,105
I don't care about the money, I care
about you. Did you call the police?

600
00:39:43,377 --> 00:39:46,083
They came, and I filed a report.

601
00:39:46,424 --> 00:39:48,678
But they can't do much
because I didn't see the guy.

602
00:39:50,614 --> 00:39:53,060
It just happened so quickly.

603
00:39:54,997 --> 00:39:56,560
It was so scary.

604
00:39:56,878 --> 00:39:59,146
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's going to be okay.

605
00:40:45,064 --> 00:40:47,820
- Did I wake you up?
- Actually, yes.

606
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,449
Good. I wanted to be the first person
to wish you a happy half-birthday.

607
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,870
Thank you.

608
00:40:54,072 --> 00:40:55,322
For everything.

609
00:40:56,596 --> 00:40:58,246
Last night with my mom,

610
00:40:58,722 --> 00:40:59,790
it was perfect.

611
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,217
I'm glad.

612
00:41:01,621 --> 00:41:04,170
- So I'll see you at the barbeque?
- Yeah, can't wait.

613
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,470
Bye, Teddy.

614
00:41:09,184 --> 00:41:10,184
Mom...

615
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:14,326
It's time to wake up.
It's my half-birthday!

616
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,672
Mom? Fine. You don't have
to get up 'cause it's my birthday,

617
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:20,519
you gotta get up to take your pills.

618
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,322
I need an ambulance.
