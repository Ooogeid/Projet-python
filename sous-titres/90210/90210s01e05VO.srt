1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,730
Come on, Beverly Hills is going to be great for our family.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,350
We got the weather, we got the palm trees with the...

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,710
More palm trees.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,540
You had, like, a million friends.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,470
Back home, and they all knew about the whole adoption story.

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,910
So when you gonna ask me out?

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,540
Maybe I don't want to ask you out.

8
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,690
I bet you that you do.

9
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,170
How would you like to put down the paintbrush and join the chorus?

10
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,280
I would so love to.

11
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,040
Thank you.

12
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,210
You owe $200.

13
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,290
Well, I don't have that, but I'll get it.

14
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,260
Adrianna, what's up with you?You okay?

15
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,390
Yeah...

16
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,630
I'm just distracted.

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,430
I went to Dad's office last night and I saw him there kissing another woman.

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,750
I'm gonna take you home, okay?

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,910
Okay.

20
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:38,920
ANNIE: This night is...

21
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,900
nothing like I thought it would be.

22
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,350
Is that a good thing?

23
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:43,840
It's a great thing.

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,130
So...you like him?

25
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,030
At the very least, we'll be friends.

26
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,820
Are we friends?

27
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,880
Hey, I-I spent the whole night making you these cookies, so eat a snickerdoodle.

28
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,920
That's way better than cookies.

No.

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,320
Please.

35
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,130
Don't.

36
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,070
What?

37
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,720
Stop!

38
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,000
You two, hold on a sec.

39
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,320
Silver, what are you doing?

40
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,350
Nothing.

41
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,640
Paying attention.

42
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,530
Sorry.

43
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,920
Checking my bhog.

44
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:37,750
Big in Bolivia.

45
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,650
Who knew?

46
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,410
All rit, well, Ty and Annie are about to have sex on stage.

47
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,480
Yeah, right.

48
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,750
I know, this is like a high school play.

49
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,310
How far you planning on taking this thing?

50
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,090
What happened to my light, Silver?

51
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,020
Ask J-Rod.

52
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,870
He's the one running the control board.

53
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,120
Okay, you're the stage manager.

54
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,450
It's your job to tell Jared when the lights go up and when the lights go down.

55
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,700
This would be when you bring the lights down.

56
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,190
Yo, J-Rod.

57
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,070
Lose the horny couple center stage.

58
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,750
Okay, thanks, everybody.

59
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,480
Right after dinner we're going to dive into theecond act, 

60
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,640
but before you all run off, 

61
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,630
I just want to say how glad I am that I came back for this.

62
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,990
Some of you just put the pros to shame, 

63
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,740
and if the audience is not standing on their feet at e end of tomorrow night, 

64
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,550
I will personally kick their asses.

65
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,580
Hey, Annie, thanks for stepping out of the chorus to understudy for Adrianna.

66
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,350
With her gone so much, it's been huge help.

67
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,020
I know it can be a little nerve-wracking.

68
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,730
More than happy to do it, Miss Walsh.

69
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,740
Thanks.

70
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,440
Hey, you going to dinner break?

71
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,950
Know what?

72
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,960
I'm not hungry.

73
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,660
Oh, me neither.

74
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,650
Jared, what is your problem?

75
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,440
I'm sorry.It's a lot of pressure ere, okay?

76
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,840
How hard can it be?

77
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,520
Look, lights on, lights off, done.

78
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,810
Great, fine, you do it.

79
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,260
Oh, no, no.

80
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,190
Where are you going?

81
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,590
Somewhere I'm appreciated.

82
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,310
I quit.

83
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,400
Ooh.

84
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,900
Looks like someone needs to work on their people skills.

85
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,960
Yeah, no kidding.

86
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,240
What kind of jackass quits during dress rehearsal?

87
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,560
This whole stage manager thing is making me mental.

88
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,630
Have you ever run a light board before?

89
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,660
Uh, no.

90
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,050
Want me to do it?

91
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,520
I did all of Annie'old shows bBck in Kansas and everything, so, you know...

92
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,750
You're a little lifesaver, you know that?

93
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,950
Yeah.

94
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,450
I know.

95
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,240
Mom.

96
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,460
Mother, why are you still in bed?

97
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,960
Why aren't you at school?

98
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,090
Because school let out.

99
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,720
It's been, oh, nine hours since I said "I love you" and "Bye.

100
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,510
I was standing here in the doorway.Remember?

101
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,320
You were laying in bed, being pathetic.

102
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,250
Get...up.

103
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,780
We're going to get groceries.

104
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,780
Okay, send Penelope with a list, Naomi.

105
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,510
Penelope is at home feeding her family.

106
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,370
Okay, then order takeout.

107
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:17,030
No, it's been a week of takeout, I'm sick of it.

108
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,190
Oh, God, Naomi.

109
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,350
I'm calling Dad.

110
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,640
No, don't do that.

111
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,720
You know, your father has Gail and the beach house and...

112
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,780
I just really don't want him seeing me like this.

113
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,430
Maybe that's what he needs.

114
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,580
It's his fault, and he needs to be the one to fix it.

115
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,630
I'm gonna tell him what a mess you are, and he needs to be here.

116
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,090
There's nobody here.

117
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,550
"Invited dress"-- what does that mean?

118
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,940
No audience.

119
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,060
Brenda wants us here for encouragement for the kids.

120
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,850
You know, Annie used to get us to take her to the theater all the time.

121
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,540
We saw every musical that came through Kansas.

122
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,030
Please tell me this is nothing like Mamma Mia.

123
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,300
Oh, I loved Mamma Mia.

124
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,490
I saw it twice on Broadway.

125
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,100
Broadway, Topeka Playhouse-- big difference.

126
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,630
Yeah, this one's not quite Mamma Mia, trust me.

127
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,110
Well, good news.

128
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,380
Spring Awakening is about kids discovering their sexuality and, you know, 

129
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,970
fighting the oppressive morals of society in 1891, but, you know, with rock music.

130
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,890
I take that back.

131
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,120
Should be a real eye-opener.

132
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,270
Annie!

133
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,180
Oh...

134
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,340
Dad.

135
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,280
Hi.

136
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,780
You're overreacting.

137
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,530
You didn't see the kiss.

138
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,490
It was...

139
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,020
You know, and the boys here are different than the boys back in Kansas.

140
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,800
I know; I used to be one.

141
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,100
Oh, and look how terridle you ended up.

142
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,800
You know, Annie could do a whole lot worse than a guy like you.

143
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,110
Sometimes I ask the Lord to take my sight away.

144
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,190
Harry caught Annie making out with a boy backstage.

145
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,790
That ought to buy the poor girl a few weeks in therapy.

146
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,900
Why are you two so calm about this?

147
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,170
Men of the theater are bons vivants, dear.

148
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,680
One day, they're fumbling with your bra in the back of a '52 Chevy,

149
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,090
and the next, they're off to Mykonos to set up house with a stagehand named Phillip.

150
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,660
I think what your mother is trying to say is 

151
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,020
that Annie's little romance might not be that serious.

152
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,560
Well, I am, I'm going to have a talk with her when she comes home.

153
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,630
And I'll have the psycatrist standing by.

154
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,950
Harry, you are a wonderful father, 

155
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,730
but there are some things that are just strictly mother-daughter, 

156
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,870
so let me talk to Annie.Okay?

157
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,740
Mm.

158
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,080
Mom, I'm coming in.

159
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,180
Forget buying groceries, Naomi.

160
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,060
I'm not cooking.

161
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,390
How about we eat out instead?

162
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,720
I'm feeling like Italian.

163
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,800
Oh, hello, Charles.

164
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,410
Will you be joining us?

165
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,430
Tracy.

166
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,750
You lok great.

167
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,510
I thought you said she couldn't get out of bed.

168
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,650
Well, I mean, clearly you've inspired her.

169
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,070
You're already helping out, Daddy.

170
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,470
uld you give us a second, sweetheart?

171
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,620
Oh, sure, yeah, of course.

172
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,640
I'll just go make reservations at Modaio.

173
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,700
For three?

174
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,540
What's going on, Tracy?

175
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,820
Well, let's...

176
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,210
see.

177
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,360
Last time I checked, you left your wife and daughter for a life 

178
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,650
at the beach house with your longtime whore.

179
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,970
Did I leave anything out?

180
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,090
I know you're hurting.

181
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,580
You don't have to put on an act; not for me.

182
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,220
Okay.

183
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,060
That make you feel better?

184
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,480
Mm-hmm.

185
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,230
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

186
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,430
There's a plate in the fridge for you; I'll warm it up.

187
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,840
Oh, thanks.

188
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,650
So did Dad tell you what happened today?

189
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,650
Oh, yeah.

190
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,750
I got all the gory details.

191
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,240
You want to talk about it?

192
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:43,310
No, I, uh, would rather hit myself repeatedly with a hammer.

193
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,740
I notice you've been spending a lot of time with Ty.

194
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,950
Yeah, but it's not just a play thing, Mom.

195
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,320
I like Ty.A lot.

196
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,830
You said the same thing about Jason in The King and I.

197
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,460
Yeah, well, Jason was big and sweet and Kansas.

198
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,660
Ty is tall and skinny and cool, 

199
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,630
and he's got these ears that stick out like little elves'.

200
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,370
Can I be your mom for a second?

201
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,330
Oh, no, no, no.

202
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,790
Mom, Mom, please do not turn this into a sex talk.

203
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,850
Okay, today has been humiliating enough.

204
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,300
But if you are thinking about it, 

205
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,420
or if he's pressuring you or you're confused, 

206
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,550
you know it's okay to wait.Right?

207
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,650
Yeah, I-I know the consequences, Mom.

208
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,760
The emotional consequences, too?

209
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,630
Like whaif he doesn't call or he doesn't say hi to you at school, 

210
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,640
or worse-- he tells all of his friends?

211
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,190
Ty is notha]g like that.

212
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,480
Okay.

213
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,210
I trust your judgment.

214
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,920
So...

215
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,920
Dad's going to forget what he saw today, right?

216
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,630
Oh, no, that's never going to happen.

217
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,850
You're late, Adrianna.

218
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,510
Again.

219
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,170
By the looks of things, so is everyone else.

220
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,570
Actually, everyone else is backstage getting fitted for the show.

221
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,170
Look, I get it.

222
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:21,770
I've been distracted lately, maybe I've missed a couple of rehearsals, 

223
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,810
but let's just be honest.

224
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,870
This is just a high school play.

225
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:26,870
I was on television.

226
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,640
I was in movies.

227
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,860
Yeah, well, that's all great stuff for the program, 

228
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,920
but I'm worried about you right now.

229
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,330
Don't be.I'm fine.

230
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,740
I'm on your side.You can talk to me.

231
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,800
And tell you what?

232
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:44,620
That I woke up at 5:00 this morning, all so I could meet a trainer that my mom can't afford?

233
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,460
That the reason I'm late is 'cause I went to a commercial audition that 

234
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,830
I'm not gonna get because I'm too fat, too brunette or too old?

235
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,450
And then there's this.

236
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,950
And there's you, and there's the voices in my head that keep telling me 

237
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,800
that I'm not trying hard enough

238
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,970
Okay.

239
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,050
I cannot change what happens out there, 

240
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,900
but we can change what happens here.

241
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:14,490
I care about you, I care about this play, and I think you can be good.

242
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,290
I am good.

243
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,140
And I love a girl with confidence.

244
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,950
Take it from the top?

245
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,310
You got it.

246
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,880
Your dad caught you and Ty...?

247
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,210
And told my mom, who then turned it into an after school special, Sex Talk.

248
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,920
What's an after school special?

249
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,640
Google it.

250
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,740
Oh, hello, Annie.

251
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,700
Silver.

252
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,810
Your Highness.

253
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,690
What are we chatting about today, ladies?

254
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:28,720
Well, if you must know, Annie's dad caught her and Ty Collins in a backstage liplock.

255
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,510
Nice work, new girl.

256
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,840
Haven't you only been here, like, a month?

257
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,600
You're already bagging one of the hottest guys at school?

258
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,030
No one is bagging anyone.

259
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,410
It was just a kiss.

260
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,480
Oh, whatever.

261
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,540
With a guy like Ty, it's only a matter of time.

262
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,710
He's had everybody, and it looks like you're next.

263
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,130
I am not having sex with Ty Collins.

264
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,570
Why not?

265
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,080
You're friends, right?

266
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,580
You should explore the benefits.

267
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,670
Uh, yeah, it's just that not everybody's a ho-bot like you, Naomi.

268
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,870
Very good, Silver.

269
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,910
What is this-- "The Last Virgin Wins"?

270
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,650
SILVER: If Anniwants to wait for the right guy, I think she should.

271
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,310
Thank you.

272
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,960
Whatever.Everyone makes sex a big humongous deal.

273
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,990
Ethan and I didn't wait.

274
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,810
I mean, we practically did it instantly.

275
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,300
Doesn't everyone want what Ethan and I have?

276
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,010
Oh, hi, baby.

277
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,240
We were just talking about you.

278
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,970
Hey, Annie, good luck in the show tonight; we'll be watching.

279
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,570
You guys are actually coming tonight?

280
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,500
Oh, yeah.

281
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,310
Well, maybe to the after party.

282
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,740
Break a leg.

283
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,540
Thanks.

284
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,480
So, you're going to give me a piggyback ride to class.

285
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,150
Again?

286
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,710
They do seem happy, don't they?

287
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,910
Yeah, you are not ready for sex.

288
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,630
See you later.

289
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,690
Hello, ladies.

290
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,430
Hey, you have a minute?

291
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,640
I have exactly a minute before the students descend.What's up?

292
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,920
Uh, Brenda is worried about Adrianna.

293
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,570
With reason, probably.

294
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,790
She's been distant, distracted in class.

295
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,910
What's she like in rehearsal?

296
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,520
She's amazing.

297
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,470
Uh, incredible instincts, fantastic voice.

298
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,660
But?

299
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,580
But, like you said, a little...

300
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,900
A little distant and distracted.

301
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:13,410
Though, in her defense, she's under intense pressure from pretty much every angle in her life.

302
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,410
You think she's using?

303
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,080
I don't know.I don't think so.

304
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,940
It's a possibility, though.

305
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,460
We should pull her from the play.

306
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,490
No, Kelly.

307
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,910
You just said she's under intense pressure...

308
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,260
Yeah, and the play, I think, is the only thing keeping her off the ledge.

309
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,610
Look, I can handle this, all right?

310
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,830
She trusts me.

311
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,140
I just don't know if this play is the best thing for her right now.

312
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:40,050
The tricky part of teaching is being friendly without becoming their friend.

313
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,050
I got this.Please?

314
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,970
Forgive me.

315
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,070
It was me, all me.

316
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,950
I can hear your heart beat, Wendla.

317
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,520
Oh, Melchi.

318
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,700
Uh, I, um...

319
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,540
I suddenly feel off.

320
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,690
Let's take a break, okay?

321
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,130
Are you okay?

322
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,440
Yeah, yeah.No.

323
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,130
No.

324
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,380
I don't know.

325
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,810
I barely got any sleep last night.

326
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,920
You know, pre-show jitters, I think.

327
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,550
And now, I suddenly feel nauseous, and...

328
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,560
Don't you?

329
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,450
I mean, you're the lead.

330
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,930
I'm just in the chorus.

331
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,130
Well, you also understudy Adrianna.

332
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,730
You know all her lines.

333
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,490
Mine, too, probably.

334
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,060
You're just psyching yourself out.

335
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,540
God, I hope you're right.

336
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,930
Trust me.

337
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,680
So, are you going to The Roosevt after the show?

338
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,810
Oh, for sure.

339
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,790
Naomi says it's fantastic.

340
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,080
You know, a huge pool, swanky deck chairs everywhere.

341
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,900
Celebrities lounging here and there.And there and there.

342
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,020
I booked us a room.

343
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,370
You booked us a room?

344
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,440
Right.

345
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,580
For us?

346
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,370
Only if you want to.I...

347
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,540
Yeah.Yeah.Sure.

348
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,850
Uh, why wouldn't I?

349
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,600
You relax.???????

350
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,790
???????dinner.

351
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,020
What do you expect?She's nervous.

352
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,550
Yeah, well, she never used to get this way before shows in Kansas.

353
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,260
Well, that was then.

354
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,870
This is California.

355
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,690
You know, hon, don't you feel like the Roosevelt Hotel is a little fancy for an after party?

356
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,590
I mean, isn't the whole spirit of theatre about camaraderie in the face of starvation and poverty?

357
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,220
Harry, we have to let her go.

358
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:24,700
No, no, we don't have to l Huh-- no-- legally, 

359
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,070
she has to do what we say until she is 18.

360
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,620
Right, and then spends the rest of her life resenting us.

361
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,230
It is a hotel.

362
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,660
Right?

363
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,040
With rooms and beds and horny teenage boys.

364
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,540
Annie is a smart girl.

365
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,230
She makes intelligent decisions.

366
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,310
Yes, I know that she is a smart girl, 

367
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,930
but she is no match for the young male libido.

368
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,390
You can't put your experiences on Annie.

369
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:46,990
No!

370
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,850
No, not my experiences.

371
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,220
My mistakes.

372
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,420
I have a kid running around out there somewhere 

373
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,590
because of a mistake that I made when I was a teenager.

374
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,290
That's your regret, Harry.

375
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,190
You can't let that stop Annie from living.

376
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,370
All we can do is guide her to a path, and then, 

377
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,450
whatever path she chooses, that's her decision.

378
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,640
Mom?

379
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,480
Oh.

380
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,990
Wow.

381
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,810
Uh, can I get a ride to school?

382
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,810
There's a vocal warm-up at 6:30.

383
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,420
Okay, uh, just, uh, let me get my keys.

384
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,180
That's it.

385
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,710
Pitch your voice into your resonators.

386
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,020
Keep it there.

387
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,480
Adrianna?

388
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,480
Where have you been?

389
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,530
I have been texting you all afternoon.

390
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,660
Um, I have been here rehearsing with Brenda.

391
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,790
Hi.I'm Brenda Walsh, the play's director.

392
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,340
Your daughter has an amazing talent.

393
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,320
Yes, I'm very, very proud of her.

394
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,470
Sweetheart...

395
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,460
Mom, it was so amazing.

396
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,490
We went over and over everything, the entire play, and my voice sounds fine.It's great.

397
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,170
Good, because you have three agents coming.

398
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,700
There's agents?

399
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,410
Mm-hmm.And twproducers, and I am seating them stage left, 

400
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,310
so if you can remember-- cheat your songs left.

401
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,780
That's great, Mom.

402
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,520
You're going to be amazing.

403
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,380
All you have to do is kill in this performance, 

404
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:21,460
and you'll start working again, and then, we'll both be fine.

405
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,910
Nice to have met you.

406
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,240
Annie, wait a second.

407
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,000
Dad, I'm really late, and Ms.Walsh is going to kill me, 

408
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,210
and I'm all kinds of nerves, and the more I talk...

409
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,410
We have to talk about what happened the other day with that boy.

410
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,220
His name is Ty, Dad.

411
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,980
And he's your boyfriend?

412
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,160
It's possible, okay?

413
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,370
I'm really, realHy late.

414
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,410
It's just, with rehearsal and everything, 

415
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,190
you haven't had time to bring him by.

416
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,970
Ty...

417
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,100
Ty.?by the house

418
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,050
You want to spend time with Ty?

419
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,010
Well, yeah.

420
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,210
I got a great idea.

421
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,460
Uh, why don't we all go out after the play?

422
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,220
Like...well, like we did back inn Kansas.

423
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,570
You, me, Ty, Mom, Grandma, the whole family.

424
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,360
Awesome, except you know I'm going the party at The Roosevelt.

425
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,670
Well, the Roosevelt has a restaurant, doesn't it?

426
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,150
Oh, Dad, stop, okay?

427
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,950
I know what you're doing.

428
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,890
What am I doing?

429
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,980
You don't trust me.

430
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,480
No, I do, I do trust you.

431
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,830
Then why are we talking?

432
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,090
Because I do not want you to make a mistake.

433
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,930
And when it comes to sex...

434
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,540
No...

435
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,090
no, I am not having this conversation.I'll be inside.

436
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:32,730
No!

437
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,710
Hey-Hey, Annie?

438
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,710
Dad, you either trust me, or you don't, 

439
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,690
and it's really sounding like you don't.

440
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,090
Nope.

441
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,390
No Adrianna.

442
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,150
Where is she?

443
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,470
Have you tried her cell?

444
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,820
Um, Silver, about the light...

445
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,110
Dixon, not now.

446
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,460
I called her-- it's off.

447
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,320
Texts ignored.

448
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,590
Witness her makeup corner-- untouched.

449
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,030
Look, I scoured the halls.

450
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,230
She's AWOL.

451
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,810
Again.

452
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,570
All right, Silver, you're the stage manger.

453
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,820
What are you going to do?

454
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,320
Has anybody seen Adrianna?

455
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,820
Ugh, I'm right here, freak show.

456
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,540
Calm down.

457
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,790
Adrianna...

458
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,350
Mm-hmm?

459
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,920
What's wrong with you?

460
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:33,270
Oh, um, I just ran out to get some cough medicine.

461
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,840
Ugh, all this singing, it's just, like ripped my throat.

462
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,620
Chill.

463
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,070
I'm here, and I'm ready to rock.

464
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,680
Whoo!

465
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,840
You can't go out there like this.

466
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,910
Of course I can.

467
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,200
Annie, you're up.

468
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,510
You can't do that!

469
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,680
Change out of that costume, put on Adrianna's.?????

470
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,300
Frickin'...

471
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,620
15 minutes.

472
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:11,700
Um...

473
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,500
okay.

474
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,690
I know it's just a regular high school play, 

475
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,430
but you are gonna be blown away by Adrianna.

476
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,310
Ah, Adrianna's gonna be so excited you're here.

477
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,310
Thank you so much.

478
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,370
Get settled.

479
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,480
I'm gonna check on her backstage.

480
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,000
What did you argue with her about?

481
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,520
No, see, it wasn't an argument,t it was a civil conversation.

482
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,050
Yes, until it turned.

483
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,110
Harry, tonight is a big night for Annie.

484
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,350
Yes.

485
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,420
Absolutely right.

486
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,990
And I have to pull back.

487
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,300
And trust that she will do the right thing.

488
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,370
Okay, I'm gonna have my script open and in front of me during the whole play.

489
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,700
Forget a line, look backstage.

490
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,050
I'll just shoot it to you.

491
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,700
Oh, my God.my God.my God.

492
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,620
Just breathe.

493
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,560
I am breathing.

494
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,750
Breathe slower.

495
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,990
Romeo to the rescue.

496
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:02,900
Melchior.

497
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,550
Whatever.

498
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,890
Hey.Uh, can you please just help me deal with this?

499
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,540
I have to go deawith something else backstage.

500
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,410
All right.

501
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,140
Dixon, I need you-- now.

502
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,590
Just relax.You're gonna be great.

503
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,590
Oh, keep doing that.That feels good.That helps a lot.

504
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,340
Okay.

505
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,220
Five minutes!

506
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,740
Five minute to call, people!

507
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:20,580
Oh.

508
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,600
I better go.

509
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:25,080
Hey, remember, when you're out there, just look at me.

510
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,260
When we're on stage, there's nobody else.

511
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,140
Just you and me.Okay?

512
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,300
All right, you're gonna be great.

513
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,700
Coming through-- looking for Silver.

514
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,210
sorry, man.

515
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,540
You okay?

516
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,450
Define okay.

517
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,290
No time.

518
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,140
Just don't mess this up, all right?

519
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,010
Your sister's counting on you.

520
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,250
Four minutes to call, people!

521
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,360
I don't understand, where's Adrianna?

522
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:13,380
I don't know.

523
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,290
I'm gonna go find out.

524
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,350
Adrianna, you okay?

525
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,570
CONSTANCE: Does she look okay?

526
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:37,130
There are half a dozen agents and producers here  to see her in this show.

527
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,100
????????

528
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,280
Look at your daughter.

529
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,310
What...?

530
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,980
What?I'm fine!

531
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,570
Who are you?

532
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,350
Kelly Taylor.

533
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,450
I am Adrianna's guidance counselor.

534
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,470
I want to talk to the director.

535
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,900
She's your friend.

536
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,590
Tell her to put me back in the play.

537
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,620
I talked to her.

538
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,860
And she's worried about you.

539
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,700
She thinks you might be using drugs.

540
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,470
Excuse me?

541
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,060
Wait, is this, uh, "director"-- did she actually see her take something?

542
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,710
Mom, I didn't take anything.

543
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,410
You know all I see?

544
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:16,030
I see a little girl who was tired and upset.

545
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,890
For good reason.

546
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:17,880
Let's go.

547
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,960
Come on.

548
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,460
Adrianna, we have to talk about this.

549
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,820
Come see me Monday.

550
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,060
Come on, baby, let's go.

551
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,280
Annie.

552
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:56,880
Yeah?

553
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,890
Go!

554
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:58,770
Right.

555
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,780
I gotta change.

556
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,990
Dixon?

557
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,490
Blackout on stage.

558
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,300
Dixon?

559
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,090
Hey, Silver.

560
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,420
Hey, what?

561
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,550
I kinda like it when you're bossy like that.

562
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,490
Okay, lights back up.

563
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,500
This is all Dad's stuff.

564
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,410
You bet it is.

565
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,390
What are you doing with it?

566
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,800
Giving it to the Malibu Mission.

567
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,020
So, one day soon, your father will step out of his beach house 

568
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,930
and see a homeless man wearing his tailor-fit Armani, 

569
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:54,030
and he will think of me.

570
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,390
I thought you guys were getting back together.

571
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,260
Back together?

572
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:01,610
Naomi, your father and I are divorcing.

573
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,160
I was lying by the stream, and then I saw you here.

574
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,510
Yes.

575
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,290
So...

576
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,860
So...

577
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,050
The stream.

578
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,740
Dreaming again?

579
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,430
I was, I guess.

580
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,310
Tell me.

581
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,420
It's silly.

582
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,770
And I can't remember the last time your father and I could talk without fighting.

583
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,820
So I asked him to make a choice.

584
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,850
Me or Gail.

585
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,440
And what did he say?

586
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,740
He said that he couldn't decide.

587
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:53,470
So, I'm making the decision for him.

588
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:54,860
And...

589
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,410
this is suppose to get him to come home?

590
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:00,670
I have to respect myself.

591
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,950
And more importantly I need you to respect me.

592
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,760
And please...

593
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:09,110
don't tell me you do.

594
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,300
So, this is it.

595
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,970
Yeah.

596
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,000
This is it.

597
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,380
But...

598
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,230
we're gonna be okay.

599
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,770
How?

600
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,540
I was kind of hoping you would have an answer for that one.

601
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,030
Normally would.

602
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,540
Come here.

603
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,440
I love you.

604
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,780
Somebody call Brenda out!

605
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,990
Brenda!

606
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,820
So, you think more about the party after?

607
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,500
And your hotel room?

608
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,960
Go.

609
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,330
Let me say bye to my family.

610
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,940
And I will be right behind you.

611
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,170
Great.

612
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,230
Dixon!

613
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,960
Annie, oh, man!

614
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,990
You were on tonight!

615
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,700
Yo, the audience ate up everything you gave 'em.

616
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:35,770
Thanks.

617
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,720
And Silver, you know, she's a big pot of mean.

618
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:39,910
Just big...

619
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,310
seething, hot pot of mean.

620
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,090
Yeah, can I see your wallet?

621
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:44,980
Uh...yeah.

622
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,580
I mean I only got like $11 or whatever, so if you need money.

623
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,010
No, I need your condom.

624
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,320
Whoa, uh, run that by me again.

625
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:54,110
The condom you've been saving in your wallet for five years, I need it.

626
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:54,940
Whoa, whoa.

627
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,770
Four years.

628
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,160
What do you need it for?

629
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,200
Oh!

630
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,460
With-With Ty?

631
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,840
He got us a room.

632
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,330
What about Ethan?

633
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,250
Ethan and I are never gonna happen.

634
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,420
Besides, I...

635
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:09,620
I like Ty.

636
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,400
A lot.

637
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,290
You sure you want to do this?

638
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,590
I don't know.

639
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,420
I think so.

640
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,380
Maybe.

641
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,480
Uh, look, I just-- I want to be prepared.

642
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,530
Ah.

643
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,430
Um...

644
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,630
Okay.

645
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,150
Uh...

646
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,930
Well, uh...

647
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,310
this is a...

648
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,800
pretty disturbing moment between us, isn't it?

649
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,610
Uh, let's never speak of it.

650
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,640
Yeah.

651
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,690
Uh...???????

652
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:45,980
Hey, uh, I brought you flowers.

653
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,770
Great, okay.

654
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,140
- Ethan, stop, wait-- just give it back.
- No.

655
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,930
You cannot have sex with Ty Collins.

656
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:03,940
Why not?

657
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,940
What do you even know about him?

658
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,660
The guy is a total player.

659
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:11,410
This coming from you, the guy who cheated on his girlfriend.

660
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,820
I saw you in front of school in your car getting...

661
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:15,120
I know.I know.

662
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,890
By some girl Some girl who was not Naomi.

663
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,880
And I'm reminded of it every day, all the time.

664
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,810
But...

665
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,370
Ty Collins?

666
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:28,170
Wouldn't you rather save yourself for someone who cares about you?

667
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,820
I tried that.

668
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,190
It didn't work out.

669
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,290
Annie, where are you going?

670
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,430
To find my parents.

671
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,980
To get to my party.

672
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,870
???????????

673
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,130
Ooh, I didn't want to do it.

674
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,720
I know, but you had to.

675
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,870
And you were right to.

676
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,550
Adrianna needs help.

677
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,200
I forgot what it was like to be in high school.

678
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,990
You know, the pressure on these kids...

679
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,430
and you should have seen Adrianna's mom.

680
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,370
How do you do this every single day?

681
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:08,340
Oh, it's not easy, but it's not always quite so High School Musical.

682
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,060
I mean, I try to help them as much as I can, 

683
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,550
but sometimes I have to remind myself it's okay for these kids to make mistakes.

684
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,840
I mean, we did.

685
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,280
Oh, m aware.

686
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,020
I didn't forget everything about high school.

687
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,750
Yeah, but sometimes, don't you wi you could?

688
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,730
Hey.

689
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,250
Hi, superstar.

690
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,460
What are you doing up here lurking on your balcony?

691
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,560
Ooh, can I have a peek inside?

692
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,500
Very nice.

693
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,220
So I watched some of your show.

694
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:08,180
You and Annie were all sparks and electricity.

695
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:11,680
I'd give you an A in both theater and chemistry.

696
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:13,340
Thanks.

697
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,380
I'm kind of waiting for her, actually.

698
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,780
You are?

699
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,320
That's weird.

700
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,430
Why is that weird?

701
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,240
Well, because she left the play with Ethan.

702
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,920
He's probably just giving her a ride.

703
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:30,500
It didn't look like that to me, not from the make-out session that I saw.

704
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,680
You know, you actually did a pretty good job tonight, Dixon.

705
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,770
Well, thank you, thank you.

706
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,320
Well, back at you.

707
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,120
Whatever.

708
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:51,720
Is there anything in this whole world that you actually do care about?

709
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:56,020
I care that your sister got through her performance without knocking over any s pieces.

710
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:56,770
Okay.

711
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,300
Or sounding like an amnesiac.

712
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,800
And that I didn't get blamed for ruining the show.

713
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,220
You want to know what I think?

714
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,040
Do I have a choice?

715
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,940
No...

716
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,400
uh...

717
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,990
I think that you want to do a good job, but if you did, 

718
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,150
then that would mean that you actually care, 

719
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,410
and if you cared, then that would mean that you...

720
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,280
What was that for?

721
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,400
You ask way too many questions.

722
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,540
You know that, right?

723
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,790
Uh-huh.

724
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,350
Come on.

725
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:15,340
Annie, hi.

726
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:16,790
Oh, I'm...I'm sorry.

727
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,770
I...I guess I must have the wrong room.

728
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,420
I was just looking for Ty.

729
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,200
No, you have the right room.

730
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,550
Come in.

731
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,530
You did a really great job in my part tonight.

732
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:37,060
You really brought down the house.

733
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,190
Uh...

734
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,350
Adrianna, I never thought that I would go on in your place.

735
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,490
It was as big a surprise to me as it was to you.

736
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,960
Right.

737
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,760
Ty's in the shower.

738
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,850
Do you want me to go get him?

739
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,630
In the shower?

740
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,210
Rinsing off.

741
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:57,460
He didn't tell you to meet him here, too, did he?

742
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,150
Um...

743
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:03,990
Boy really knows how to celebrate, doesn't he?

744
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,490
Well, I'll go tell him his next appointment is here.

745
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,710
No, um...

746
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,180
No, you...you two just...

747
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:16,750
yeah, uh, don't tell him anything, okay?

748
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:42,260
Annie?

749
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,010
What, are you following me?

750
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,050
No, uh, I'm just waiting for Naomi.

751
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:47,950
I have to get out of here.

752
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,040
Wait, wait.

753
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:49,800
What's wrong?

754
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,460
Did Ty do something to you?

755
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,380
Ty did not do anything to me.

756
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:58,420
Whatever Ty is doing, he is doing it up there with Adrianna 

757
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,500
and whoever else he invited here tonight.

758
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,820
Annie.

759
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,890
Hey, what's going on?

760
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:09,160
What's going on is I came here tonight, fully prepared to have sex for the first time.

761
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:17,470
Here I am at the Roosevelt in Hollywood about to give it up for the first time to some guy that I barely know.

762
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:23,910
This whole world that you guys live in ght be fine for the two of you and all of your friends with all of their benefits, 

763
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,780
but it is definitely not fine with me.

764
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,950
What's the matter?

765
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,000
I don't have one.

766
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,740
One what?

767
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,390
A condom.

768
00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:00,320
Four years, I kept that thing in my wallet, and tonight I give it to my sister.

769
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,560
Okay, first...

770
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,010
creepy.

771
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,200
And second...

772
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,460
wow.

773
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,320
Luck really takes its time with you, huh?

774
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,810
And, uh, finally...

775
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,470
what'd you think was gonna happen here, huh?

776
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:18,060
Did you think we were gonna get a room or just go at it right here on the lounger?

777
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,110
You mean...

778
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,960
No, no.

779
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,590
No, we're taking this slow.

780
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,360
- Silver...
- What?

781
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,030
You're being bossy again.

782
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,150
But I like it.Come on.

783
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,380
All right.

784
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,200
Oh, I wouldn't move that one.

785
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,880
Oh, I think that...

786
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,280
Annie, you're home early.

787
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,990
Yeah, the party was really loud, 

788
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:54,850
and I didn't realize how tired I was after the play and everything, so I...

789
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,350
I just want to go to bed.

790
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,360
Welcome home.

791
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,460
You...

792
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,480
you were really great tonight.

793
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,760
Thanks.

794
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,140
We're proud of you.

795
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,320
Good night.

796
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,010
Good night.

797
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


798
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
