00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,200
Previously on 90210...

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,190
I'm the guy that hit you.

3
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,180
It was totally my fault.

4
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,570
You know, the important thing is that we're both all right.

5
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,170
Navid, I'm not really asking you for anything.

6
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,120
Odod, 'cause i-i don't know if I can do anything

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,220
Or be anything to you.

8
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,210
I reserved a hotel suite; aying there

9
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,510
-Until mom comes home. -hey, everyone.

10
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,880
I have something to anncounced I'm pregnant

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,050
- Christin hey, - nika.

12
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,880
I'd like you to meet navid.

13
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,800
Hi. what's up?

14
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,100
This being in love stuff

15
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,550
Is making me crazy.

16
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,190
- You love me? - I do.

17
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,360
What is this about?

18
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,280
I'm just trying to get to know you.

19
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,440
The accident, it changed things.

20
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,560
I mean, I feel like it woke me up or something,

21
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,110
Like it jolted me out of my bubble.

22
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,120
The bubble that I'm still in.

23
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,130
Coming.

24
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,630
Morning, aaron.

25
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,300
Good morning, ms. clark.

26
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,240
Have a nice da

27
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,350
Fashion section?

28
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,400
Always.

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,600
Your car is waiting, ms. clark

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
Thank you.

31
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,910
Morning, troy.

32
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,530
You're not robert.

33
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,580
Picked up his morning shift.

34
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,370
Hope you're not disappointed, naomi.

35
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,590
How do you know my name?

36
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,200
Oh, robert told me to expect you.

37
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,960
Although... I wasn't expecting you.

38
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,460
Vanilla skim latte.

39
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,300
Extra foam.

40
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,600
Don't walk away from me

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,300
When I'm talking to you!

42
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,350
Hey! I am talking to you.

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,440
I said I want a bloody scotch.

44
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
I'm sorry, sir.

45
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,780
The bar doesn't open until 10:00.

46
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,780
Do you know who I am?!

47
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,110
Let me tell you this slow, right,

48
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,400
So you can understand my english

49
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,120
Get me a scotch!

50
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,370
Or I'll call ins and get you shipped back to mexico

51
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,910
Faster  than you y "burrito." how's that?

52
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,620
Excuse me.

53
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,630
Small problem.

54
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,080
What?

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,110
Well, just that it'd be odd

56
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,750
If you tried to send miguel here

57
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,630
Back to mexico since he's fm m guatemala.

58
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,300
Unless you meant send him on vavacation,

59
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,080
Which would actually be a nice thing to do,

60
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,640
Considering he works hard

61
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,340
And has to do with drunks like you all day.

62
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,180
You looking for an ass kicking, sunshine?

63
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,730
No, not particularly.

64
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,900
What the hell are you doing?

65
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,400
What--

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,270
Get off! do you know who I am?!

67
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,320
Hey! what-what are you--

68
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,190
Get off me!

69
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,750
Hey, babe.

70
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,700
You weren't supposed to see that.

71
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,540
Oh, all right, i... I didn't see it.

72
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,120
But good choice on the red rose.

73
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,760
It definitely brings out my eyes.

74
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,930
And I love your eyes.

75
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,210
I love you.

76
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,210
I love you, too.

77
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,180
I love hearing that.

78
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,180
I love saying it.

79
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,550
I love being in it.

80
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,180
I mean, it's like everything is different now.

81
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,140
I feel different now.

82
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,520
Oh, this morning on the radio, they played whitney houston.

83
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,970
First time I ever heard her and she didn't sound i like

84
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,690
Some big sappy goober I i wanted to strangle.

85
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,530
Oh, yeah?

86
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,610
Yeah.

87
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,060
Because...

88
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,030
I will always love you.

89
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,120
Always.

90
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,460
Always love you.

91
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,960
Well, you know, you're being

92
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,660
A big cheesy goober right no t too.

93
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,750
Yeah, well, I'm your big cheesy goober, okay?

94
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,830
All right, so...

95
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,330
What?

96
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,390
So you're still not gonna tell me anything about

97
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,500
Our mysterious valentine's plans, huh?

98
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,220
If I tell you it won't be mysterious.

99
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,670
Oh, all right, whitney, do your thing.

100
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,890
Do your thing. uh-huh.

101
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,890
Souhuh, I could pick you up around 8:00

102
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,260
If youanant to just grab dinner before the dance.

103
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,260
I can't.

104
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,320
I actually, uh, got to

105
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,730
The acting intensive that I signed up for.

106
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,320
So I'll be there until 9:00, if you want to pick me up then.

107
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,490
Sure.

108
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,410
Uh, you didn't tell myoyou got in.

109
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,690
Why not?

110
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,330
Yeah, um, well, it's just,

111
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,490
It's kind of hard to talk to you about acting

112
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,330
Without you thinking that acting's all I talk about.

113
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,920
Um, I said that I'm sorry about that.

114
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah, I know.

115
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,500
But you think it's trite,

116
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
and so it's kind f difficult for me to...

117
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,370
Hey, hang on one minute, okay?

118
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,290
Yeah.

119
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,510
Sure.

120
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,380
What's their deal anyway?

121
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,850
You know, they-they talk

122
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,100
About deep things.

123
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,630
But I swear, if I had to hear about how the accident

124
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,020
Changed everything one more time,

125
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,310
I may actually drive into a tree myself.

126
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,720
Okay. well, you just let me know before you do that,

127
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,030
So I'm not in the car.

128
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,360
I just want her to get better already.

129
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,530
Maybe then, he won't have to hang out with her so much.

130
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,370
Hey, rhonda. morning.

131
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,650
How are you feeling?

132
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,990
A little achy, but okay.

133
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,910
Sorry you couldn't come to the documentary with us last night.

134
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,210
Oh, yeah, I had play practice.

135
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,490
But, uh, was it any good?

136
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,660
Amazing.

137
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,960
It was all just about how

138
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,380
One momoment can change things forever.

139
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,750
Which is so true

140
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,590
I mean, the accident profoundly changed me.

141
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,760
Ethan, too.

142
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,260
I mean, he used to like action movies,

143
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,310
But now he likes documentaries.

144
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,060
Yeah, i-i think she means changes on the inside.

145
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,480
Yeah, I know.

146
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,150
I-i was just kidding.

147
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,020
All right, well,

148
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,440
We should go to class.

149
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,910
Yeah. I'll see you guys later.

150
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,420
See ya.

151
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,090
Okay, maybe you should drive into a tree.






157
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,160
It was probably some dude in rehab.

158
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,240
Bet navid knows.

159
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,630
Hi ? what's up?

160
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,130
Oh, yeah, navid knows everything. what's up?

161
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,080
So who's adrianna's baby daddy?

162
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,300
Oh, yeah, I don't even know that.

163
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,920
Could be anyone. I have no idea.

164
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,470
Man, you dodged a bullet, huh?

165
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,720
Oh, ahah, totally, man.

166
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,430
I mean, adrianna's a mess. I don't even know

167
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,890
What I was thinking, seriously.

168
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,310
I mean, she has her own thing going on.

169
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,430
I'm not even gonna worry about.

170
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,320
Yeah, me neither.

171
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,700
No "b"

172
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,610
Time for rososes.

173
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,000
Okay, so .Megan

174
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,620
And here's one

175
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,620
For you, michael.

176
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,240
Nika, here you go.

177
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,870
Another one for megan.

178
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,840
Joanna.

179
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,260
One for maya.

180
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,130
And adrianna.

181
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,150
Oh, honey.

182
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,390
I'm getting pity flowers from the faculty.

183
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,020
I mean, I thought they only did that

184
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,810
With the 12th grader in the full body cast.

185
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,440
Scoliosis girl? I think she has a boyfriend now.

186
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,730
Of course she does.

187
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,230
Hey, are you okay?

188
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:21,200
I guess for a second I thought it might be something romantic.

189
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,650
I don't know why.

190
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,620
I mean, obviously, I'm not anybody's idea

191
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,820
Of a great valentine's date.

192
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,080
I mean, look at me.

193
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,380
For the record, you look great.

194
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,380
You have super boobage going on, crazy thick hair,

195
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,670
The dewy, glowlolook that's all the rage on the runway,

196
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,990
You've got it.

197
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,760
If I were going to the island of lesbos,

198
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,760
You'd be my pick.

199
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,010
Thank you.

200
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,390
Ethan.

201
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,980
Oh, my gosh.

202
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,150
You waited?

203
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,350
I was going over my essay with mr. matthews for

204
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,900
At least a half an hour.

205
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,440
It's lunch; aren't you starvin

206
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,270
Yeah, but, I mean, what are a few hunger pains

207
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,520
Compared to what you're going through?

208
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,910
Which is all because of me.

209
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,530
So let's face it, I owe you.

210
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,030
Right? but let's go before

211
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,750
They run out of pizza and we get stuck with

212
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,450
That brown stuff they pass off as meat loaf.

213
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,590
Ethan, wait.

214
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,870
There's something I have to tell you.

215
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,370
I-i just don't know

216
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,010
How to tell you without coming off

217
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,340
Like some kind of crazy woman.

218
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,510
Which-which I'm not.

219
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,680
I-i swear.

220
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,930
What is it?

221
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,680
Um... I'm...

222
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,550
Feeling better than I've been letting on.

223
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,052
A lot better.

224
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,720
I've been exaggerating my injuries.

225
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,390
I can carry my own bag.

226
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,310
What?

227
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:39,230
I really liked spending time with you,

228
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,150
And I just thought that if I was better,

229
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,700
That you wouldn't want to hang out anymore.

230
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,820
It-it doesn't matter.

231
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,620
I'm sorry I took advantage of you.

232
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,570
You're officially off the hook.

233
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,580
What hook?

234
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,800
We're friends.

235
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,580
Just because of some car accident...

236
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,080
Who cares how we met?

237
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,380
The point is, we did.

238
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,090
And being in an accident

239
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,590
Affected us both, and we get each other.

240
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,220
More than that,

241
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,720
We like each other.

242
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,260
At least, that's what I thought.

243
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,760
I don't know, maybe-maybe you're getting

244
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,510
- Sick of me or something. - No.

245
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,230
- I-i'm not. - Okay.

246
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,900
Good.

247
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,320
But we have to be honest with each other from now on.

248
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,320
'cause life's too short for dishonesty.

249
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,110
I completely agree.

250
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,660
I wonder where ethan is.

251
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,610
Probably off discovering the meaning  l life.

252
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,360
All righ you got to help me.

253
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,080
I have to plan this unique

254
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,500
Valentine's plan.

255
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,340
I I told you, just go to the dance.

256
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,420
No. everybody's gonna go to the dance.

257
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,050
Take dixon on meme romantic valentine's dinner.

258
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,050
The boy loves food.

259
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,930
Yeah, but hasn't he been on

260
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,550
A romantic valentine's dinner before?

261
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,800
Yeah, but not in l.a.

262
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,140
And-and trust me,

263
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,550
The scene here is way different

264
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,800
Than the all-you-can-eat

265
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,890
Hot wings place in kansas.

266
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,480
- I'm gonna get another drink. you want one? - uh-uh.

267
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,980
Excuse you!

268
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,230
Excuse you!

269
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,370
I have something

270
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,740
Th's's gonna help you feel better.

271
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,820
Tell me it's the portobello quiche I dreamt about last night.

272
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,820
Voil?

273
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,160
Enjoy.

274
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,290
This almost have stalled the valentine pain.

275
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,660
You know, I've eaten the most amazing places in the world,

276
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,720
And nothing comes close to the restaurant at my hotel.

277
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,630
I guess that's why there's, like, a billion cebrbrities

278
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,580
Swarming there all the time.

279
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,000
Oh, my god, you should see

280
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,470
The valentine's day menu they have.

281
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,390
Yeah?

282
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,010
It's beyond.

283
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,470
Lucky you.

284
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,400
Of course, I don't have a date to go with to the restaurant.

285
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,820
And why, almost before we've even begun to live,

286
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,240
Become dull and gray and apathetic

287
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,860
And lazy and useless and unhappy.

288
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,860
Unhappy because I am nothing.

289
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,250
Excellent.

290
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,260
And that's what I'm talking about.

291
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,260
That is it. that's it.

292
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,050
Okay, who's next?

293
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,180
Um, all right, how about you?

294
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,520
Yeah.

295
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,220
Hi. um, I'm annie wilson.

296
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,060
And I will be doing fantine's monologue

297
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,230
From les miserable.

298
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,440
Ah, good monologue. desperate monologue.

299
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,200
A lot of pain and anguish in the class tonight.

300
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,740
Monsieur javert, i-i-i beseech your mercy.

301
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,490
I assure you that I had done nothing wrong.

302
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,370
If you had been there to see it in the beginning,

303
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,210
- Then you would have seen... - No, no. stop.

304
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,630
Um, annie, this, this woman is desperate.

305
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,220
Honey, you got to delve into your soul.

306
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,920
You gotta, you gotta reach into your own desperation.

307
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,300
Bring that out, okay?

308
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,090
Yeah.

309
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,060
Okay.

310
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,430
And I swear by the good of god that I'm not to blame.

311
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,510
Go deeper.

312
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,650
That, that gentleman,

313
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:06,240
The bourgeois whom I did not know,

314
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,820
Put snow in my back!

315
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,910
Annie, thas just louder.

316
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,740
Has anyone the right...?

317
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,690
You are about to lose

318
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,910
Ererything.

319
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,440
...to put snow down our backs,

320
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,250
While we are walking along peaceably...

321
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:16,950
Where's your soul?

322
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,250
To...

323
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,700
Annie,

324
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,840
Annie, come here.

325
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,420
You are about to lose your freedom and your child.

326
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,180
Perhaps you've never experienced something

327
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,960
Of that magnitude in your life,

328
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,300
But surely there is some painful memory

329
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,380
That you can draw on, some...

330
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,270
- You know? - Yes, yes.

331
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,300
Then go there, please.

332
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,640
Take your time.

333
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,730
I am rather ill, as you see,

334
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:54,230
And he had said these impertinent things to me...

335
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,200
O-okay.

336
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,910
That's enough. that's enough.

337
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,160
Thank you.

338
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,380
Just, let's get some, somebody else up there.

339
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,210
You're fine.




343
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,480
Thanks.

344
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,240
Why are there sugar hearts in my waffle?

345
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,140
I think, uh, nat got a little carried away

346
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,070
With the valentine's theme.

347
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,160
Is everything okay?

348
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,020
Sure, fine.

349
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,560
Come on. what's wrong?

350
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,980
Um, problems in the middle east.

351
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,570
Significant things like that.

352
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,780
Annie...

353
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,740
Look, it doesn't matter.

354
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,450
I just want to put it out of my head

355
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,490
And enjoy valentine's day with the boy that I love.

356
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,540
And rhonda?

357
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,630
Oh, um, I'm sorry. uh, she, she's early.

358
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,670
Early for what?

359
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,290
Miss, as I told you over the phone,

360
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,150
We're completely booked.

361
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,350
It's valentine's day.

362
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,650
I know that.

363
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,130
Which is why r really need to get in.

364
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,520
I want to take my boyfriend out for a special dinner,

365
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,270
And your restaurant is the best.

366
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,110
Which is why people make reservations months in aanance.

367
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,110
Months a ago, I didn't know about valentine's day!

368
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,860
No, I meant...

369
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,830
Okay, I knew it existed...

370
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,950
Look, I really wish I could help you.

371
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,080
Fine. I understand.

372
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,830
Thank you for your patience.

373
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,420
Take your ten dollars back, please.

374
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,420
Come on!

375
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,590
Restaura..

376
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,130
Certainly. tonight?

377
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,100
And what time would you like to dine?

378
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,600
Uh, hello? what's that about?

379
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,970
Excuse me one second.

380
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,600
We keep a small number of tables reserved for hotel guests

381
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,470
Now if you'll excuse me.

382
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:12,110
So, uh, what are you two crazy kids gonna get up to

383
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,280
While I'm off being tortured by my new acting teacher?

384
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,120
Um, probably just gonna go shopping.

385
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,070
For what?

386
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,870
- Clothes. - School supplies.

387
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,410
I, uh...

388
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,330
I asked rhonda to, uh, help me find you

389
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,330
A valentine's present.

390
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,250
Trying to brchch out from the stuffed pentapus thing.

391
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,920
I feel very stupid.

392
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,980
I should get going pretty soon, anyway,

393
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,590
But I assume I'll see you you at the dance?

394
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,430
Oh, i-i don't really do dances.

395
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,900
How come

396
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,980
I just had a really bad experience at one.

397
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,400
What happened?

398
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,190
Maybe she doesn't want to talk about it, ethan.

399
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,190
No, I do.

400
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,410
I mean, I don't,

401
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,330
But I should if we're being honest with each other, right?

402
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,780
Okay, so, at my old school

403
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,110
There was a bunch of girls,

404
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,330
I call them mean girls

405
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,120
But they were so much worse than that.

406
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,290
It felt like their sole purpose in life was just to pick on me.

407
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,420
Anyway, so there was this end-of-the-year dance,

408
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,180
And this guy danny asked me out.

409
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,010
And I was shock.

410
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,100
I mean, I had a huge crush on him.

411
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,020
So my mom and I went shopping,

412
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,300
And we found this dress, and it was

413
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,140
Blue and gauzy and it just,

414
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,140
It reminded me of water, of waves.

415
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,530
And I went to the dance

416
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,140
And went looking for danny.

417
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:39,820
And I fod d him standing with those girls.

418
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,950
And as soon as they saw me, they just...

419
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,460
They all started to laugh.

420
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,990
And one of the girls threw danny a hundred-dollar bill.

421
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,580
Because apparently, the whole thing was just a dare.

422
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,550
I felt so humiliated.

423
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:03,170
And so I took all my mom's sleeping pills.

424
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,920
Luckily,

425
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:11,060
My mom found me in time, and, um,and we moved here.

426
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,570
I am so sorry, rhonda.

427
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,690
I've never told anybody that story before.

428
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,820
Well, I'm glad you told us.

429
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,190
Yeah, I am too.

430
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,580
What..

431
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,290
Do you want?

432
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,670
I need reservations downstairs for dinner tonight

433
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,210
And they are completely booked unless you're a guest

434
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,710
At the hotel, which I'm not, you are,

435
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,430
And I wouldn't ask except it's valentine's day.

436
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,760
Valentine's day...

437
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,520
A holiday you once referred to as "the greeting card mafia's

438
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,470
Stranglehold on the brainless and sentimental."

439
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:53,020
Well, I know, but look..

440
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,640
I've never been in love before.

441
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,610
You... in love?

442
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,780
Yeah. and I want tonight to be perfect.

443
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,400
It has to be perfect.

444
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,700
And I know that here are no reasons for you

445
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,990
To do any favors for me, and we are not exactly friends

446
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,240
Or even frenemies for that matter,

447
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,790
But we were friends at one point, and i...

448
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,990
Look, when we were 12,

449
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,130
I wrote a book report for you on the pearl

450
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,850
And you said that you owed me one, and I never collected,

451
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,660
And I want to collect now. please?

452
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,180
Larry, hi, darling, it's naomi.

453
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,980
Can you do me a favor? I have a friend

454
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,680
Who needs a reservation for two tonight at 8:00.

455
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,850
Oh, thank you.

456
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,230
Ah! you're wonderful. bye now.

457
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,570
Just make sure you preorder the molten chocolate cake.

458
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:44,770
They cook it while you're eating.

459
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:45,820
That's the best part of the meal.

460
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,610
sounds good.

461
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:51,000
Can I buy you a drink or something to thank you?

462
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,670
So we should sit by the pool.

463
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,450
There's a really nice view.

464
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,510
Actually, it sometimes gets chilly out there

465
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,590
Do you want to just sit at the bar?

466
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,600
Sure.

467
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,880
I'll be right with you guys.

468
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,050
Thanks.

469
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,690
Well, the view isn't bad here either, huh?

470
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,440
Just don't mention we're in high school.

471
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,390
Oh, okay. I am on it.

472
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,360
So I said to my supervisor at the airline,

473
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,820
"do not talk to me like that again,

474
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,200
Or I will quit and take my skills elsewhere, I will."

475
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,570
Hey, naomi.

476
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,310
See, that's not fair. you knowy my name,

477
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,490
But I don't know yours.

478
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,660
Leo. so what can I get you two?

479
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,910
I'll have a sparkling water.

480
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,300
Trying to avoid the hard stuff

481
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,730
Till I go back over the pond.

482
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,140
I'll just have a chamomile tea, thanks.

483
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,260
What was that?

484
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,200
English accents always make people sound older.

485
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,670
in what world?

486
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,980
I can't stop now.

487
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,310
Okay, but less is more.

488
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:57,010
- You got it, mate.  - seriously.

489
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,680
- Cheerio.  - all right...

490
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,650
One sparkling water,

491
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,490
One chamomile tea.

492
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,690
Thank you. and I do appreciate that, I do.

493
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,520
Sure thing. honey?

494
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,690
Well, you're awfully forward, aren't you?

495
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,000
For your tea.

496
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,330
Honey?

497
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,080
Oh, righ

498
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,540
No thank you.

499
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,710
So you're new here.

500
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,960
yeah, just moved to l.a.

501
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,010
With your... girlfriend?

502
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,760
Well, if I had a girl,

503
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,430
I wouldn't be flirting with your friend here.

504
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,100
Excuse me, sir.

505
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,770
- Can we get another round?  - I got to get back to work.

506
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,290
Thanks.

507
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,910
Hey.

508
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,660
Hi.

509
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,170
What are you, uh...

510
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,970
Wow, what a coincidence.

511
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,050
Yeah.

512
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,890
Wait, uh, adrianna,

513
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,640
Um, I just wanted

514
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,480
To apologize for what happened by the lockers yesterday.

515
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,010
- It's fine.  - no, no, no, it's not fine.

516
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,430
I was a jerk and I'm sorry.

517
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,900
It's just, the guys were talking

518
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,570
And nika was there, and...

519
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,690
I didn't want to make her feel bad.

520
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,400
But I ended up making you feel bad, which--

521
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:32,960
Which is the last thing I wanted to do.

522
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:39,860
Look, it's a weird situation all around.

523
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,500
Trust me, I get it.

524
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,750
Right.

525
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,620
Well, the next time anybody says

526
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,670
Anything, okay,

527
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,760
I'm gonna...

528
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,040
Shut 'em down. navid-style, okay?

529
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,210
- Yeah, and what exactly does that entail?  - I don't know.

530
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,850
I'll let you know when I have that

531
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:55,630
- Figured out.  - okay.

532
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,770
Hopefully, I'll have it

533
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,130
Worked out by the dance tonight.

534
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:01,640
Well, no rush-- I'm not going.

535
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,690
Sorry to bring up the dance.

536
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,110
Now everything's even more awkward.

537
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,610
No, it's, it's not.

538
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:12,150
I'm really happy you met someone else.

539
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,530
I really am.

540
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,070
You're such a special guy.

541
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:19,120
You deserve to have fun, and to go to dances

542
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,820
And just...

543
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,990
Just be normal.

544
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,380
And normal is not really where I'm at right now.

545
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,090
Um, ooh, make sure that you get nika

546
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,470
the butter crunch truffles,

547
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,140
'cause there's really nothing like them

548
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,340
In the entire world.

549
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,640
- Truffles?  - she'll love them.

550
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,680
All right.

551
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,340
Okay.

552
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,310
Have fun eating your chocolate.

553
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,100
Happy valentine's day.

554
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,530
Yeah, you, too.

555
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,310
you know, right? that's what I thought.

556
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,060
I mean, this is nice, but it's not "wow,"

557
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,430
And I'm really going for "wow," or anything better than "wow."

558
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,730
Is there even a word that's better than "wow"?

559
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,740
Here, wear these.

560
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,650
Really?

561
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:12,650
Mm-hmm.

562
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,540
Oh, come here! thank you!

563
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,070
Okay, hugging me over shoes--

564
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,790
Seriously, what has has gotten into you, silver?

565
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,990
You're a completely diffenent person.

566
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,130
It's the love, man.

567
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,830
I'm telling you, it changes things.

568
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,300
It's like I see the world as this whole better place.

569
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,300
And, naomi, I never thought that I could feel like this.

570
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:33,010
Well, I'm glad you found somnene who makes you this happy.

571
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:39,230
Plus, it's been kind of cool us hanging out again.

572
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,350
It has, hasn't it?

573
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,350
So, okay, what are you going to do

574
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,850
about hotty bartender?

575
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,190
Oh...

576
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,150
Oh, oh, okay, wait.

577
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,690
You've got to ask him

578
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,440
for a date tonight for valentine's day.

579
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,740
Well, it's not like I have any other plans, but...

580
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,160
Oh, well, no, his shift just ended.

581
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,750
I think he said he was going home.

582
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,250
What if you send him a bottle

583
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,530
Of champagne with a note

584
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,170
Telling him to meet you by the pool?

585
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,120
Not bad. I like it.

586
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,790
Exciting! exciting! exciting!

587
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,430
- Front desk.  - larry. hi, sugar, it's me again.

588
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:16,020
Listen, I need you to do me a little unusual favor.

589
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,190
Is there any way you can have something delivered

590
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,800
To one of your employee's homes?

591
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,470
Bloody brilliant.

592
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,640
Mymy dad was sitting in his armchair

593
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,060
Drinking and yelling at the tv.

594
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,700
He loved game shows.

595
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,980
And the guy on the tv gets it wrong

596
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,700
And my dad yells at the screen,

597
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,450
"even a moron would know that!"

598
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,120
And I call out, I said,

599
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,710
"well, then you must be a moron 'cause you didn't know."

600
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,290
So that's when my dad gets up

601
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,240
Out of his chair and grabs me

602
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,210
And he, um, he takes his cigarette

603
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,500
And he... grounds it out right into my arm.

604
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,720
So, when I need

605
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,760
To know what pain feels like,

606
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,330
I got a little reminder.

607
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,930
Annie.

608
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,980
Why don't you come up here.

609
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,570
Tell us a story

610
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,940
From your life.

611
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,160
Something that matters.

612
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,740
Okay.

613
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:18,280
Um, well, there was this birthday thing that happened.

614
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,420
This really awful girl--naomi, went behind my back, and...

615
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,580
Annie,

616
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,250
Go deeper. something really painful.

617
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,760
Something that might

618
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,460
Be hard to say out loud.

619
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,210
Okay. deeper.

620
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,150
Um, well...

621
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,190
At my old school

622
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:43,270
There were these girls.

623
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,470
It felt like

624
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:50,560
Their sole purpose in life was to make me miserable.

625
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,730
Well, one day this guy danny

626
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,780
Who I had a huge crush on,

627
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,780
Asked me to the dance.

628
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,790
So, my mom and I went shopping,

629
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,460
And I bought this. blue dress.

630
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,210
And the way that it flowed down to the floor...

631
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,490
It was like water.

632
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,790
I thought, you know, that it was going

633
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,080
To be the best day of my life.

634
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,300
Only, when I got there,

635
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,380
Danny was standing...

636
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,220
With those girls,

637
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,890
And as soon as they saw me,

638
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:16,800
They started to laugh.

639
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,920
One of the girls actually

640
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,060
Threw danny a hundred-dollar bill,

641
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,930
Because it was just

642
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,090
A dare.

643
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,150
Oh, god, I don't know

644
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,260
What I was thinking,

645
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,230
Except that

646
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,480
That I wanted to stop thinking.

647
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,490
So... I took these sleeping pills

648
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,270
From my mom's medicine cabinet,

649
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,410
And I swallowed them-- all.

650
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:40,080
'cause I just want the pain to end.

651
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,500
Thank you.

652
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,700
I knew you had it in you.

653
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,670
Thank you.

654
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,800
Ethan, ethan, stop.

655
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,190
- Please!  -Rhonda told us that in confidence

656
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,610
- Because she trusted us.  - and I didn't say that it was her.

657
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:10,860
No kidding! you said it was you!

658
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,880
How could you use something like that as material?

659
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,980
I panicked. okay, I panicked,

660
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,200
Because he said, "go deeper, go deeper,"

661
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,530
And then I thought of her story.

662
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,280
It wasn't a story. It's her life.

663
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,575
- I know. - You don't.

664
00:27:20,575 --> 00:27:21,870
Otherwise you never would have done that.

665
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,320
I can't-- I can't even look at you.

666
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,890
Wow!

667
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,840
Yeah?

668
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:49,050
I-I mean, what's better than wow?

669
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,270
I don't know, but there needs to be a word.

670
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,790
I was just thinking today

671
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,600
How there should be a word.

672
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,640
Come here.

673
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,060
Told you I'd one-up the high school dance.

674
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,030
Yeah. This place is pretty awesome.

675
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,530
Oh, just wait till

676
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,730
You see the food.

677
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,885
Apparently, they have

678
00:28:08,885 --> 00:28:10,040
The best chef in the whole city.

679
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,750
Oh, and I ordered a special dessert.

680
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,460
You're gonna die.

681
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,540
What?

682
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:22,460
Just... wow.

683
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,600
Can I get you anything, Miss Clark?

684
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
Oh, no, I'm all right. Thank you.

685
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,020
I'm actually meeting someone.

686
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,070
Well, just let me know if I can.

687
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,270
Thank you.

688
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,700
I'm just saying, I've never seen my parents

689
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,980
Gush over anyone like that.

690
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,355
Well, it helps that

691
00:29:08,355 --> 00:29:10,430
They go to the same synagogue as my parents.

692
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,180
Trust me, it was all you.

693
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,800
It was all me-- yeah, right.

694
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,390
Come on, let's dance.

695
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,860
Mmm. man, it's going to be hard

696
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,860
To stuff down mom's casseroles

697
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,190
After a meal like that.

698
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:28,280
Well, as long as you saved room for dessert

699
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,530
- And here is your menu. - Oh. thanks. I actually

700
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,030
Preordered that molten chocolate cake.

701
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,620
Oh. okay.

702
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,820
Naomi said it is the best thing

703
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,490
- She's ever tried. - um, miss,

704
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,040
Are-are you sure you ordered it?

705
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,160
What? yeah.

706
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,330
I told the concierge.

707
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,330
I'm so sorry.

708
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,630
I don't have you down for one,

709
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,830
And unfortunately,

710
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,500
We're all out of them now.

711
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,670
Okay, but I ordered it.

712
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,800
- I told him specifically that... - Baby, baby,

713
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,250
It's cool-- we'll just get something else.

714
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,560
No! I don't want something else.

715
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,810
I want the chocolate cake.

716
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,340
I'm terribly sorry.

717
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,675
No, you don't have to be sorry,

718
00:29:57,675 --> 00:29:59,010
Just go get us the cake, please.

719
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,285
Go get us the cake.

720
00:30:00,285 --> 00:30:01,560
Um, can you just give us a sec?

721
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,180
Honey, uh,

722
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,180
Why are you getting so upset?

723
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,730
Because I wanted this to be perfect,

724
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,990
And now it's not gonna be perfect!

725
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,900
Silver... silver,

726
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,020
Relax.

727
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,440
Listen, us...

728
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,860
Being here together, me and you,

729
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,160
That's what makes this perfect.

730
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,250
All right the cake, it's just cake.

731
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,080
All right?

732
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,350
And besides, I didn't even give you your gift yet.

733
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,930
Go ahead, open it.

734
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,110
You like it?

735
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,980
Love it.

736
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,860
I really love it.

737
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,880
Let's get a room.

738
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,330
What?

739
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,460
I love you, and... I want to be with you.

740
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,580
So let's get a room.

741
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,750
Here.

742
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,050
Tonight.

743
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:17,090
Can we?

744
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,590
Yeah.

745
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,430
Yeah.

746
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,710
Um, Where's Annie?

747
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,250
Don't know, don't care.

748
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,140
I thought you weren't coming.

749
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,300
Oh, ye..

750
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,260
But after what happened today,

751
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,920
After telling you guys,

752
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,140
I just felt better.

753
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,390
I don't know

754
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,310
Like maybe I could handle it.

755
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,150
Well, I'm glad you're here.

756
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,730
And you look beautiful.

757
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,820
Thanks.

758
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,320
Uh, you want to dance?

759
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,830
Definitely.

760
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,450
Hey, this is Ethan.

761
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:15,500
Leave a message after the tone.

762
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,250
Ethan, please call me back.

763
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,840
I know what I did was wrong,

764
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,950
And I'm ashamed of myself.

765
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,590
So please, just forgive me.

766
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,930
Um... are you sure you're ready for this?




770
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,040
I've never been more ready

771
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,890
For anything in my life.















786
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:31,865
When you said you are bad at dancing,

787
00:33:31,865 --> 00:33:33,120
I totally thought

788
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,580
You were just kidding.

789
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,040
Aw, come on, you were just so jealous

790
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,790
Of my sweet, sweet dance move

791
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,370
Oh, so very jealous!

792
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:41,820
Your chariot, Madam.

793
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,740
Thanks.

794
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,580
I... I had a really good time.

795
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,160
Yeah. yeah, me, too.

796
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:51,080
It was just what I needed.

797
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,390
So...

798
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,920
Good night?

799
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,430
Yeah. yeah.

800
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,990
What?

801
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:12,440
Uh... We-we're friends.

802
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,070
- Yeah, but I...  - You know,

803
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,330
I-I have a girlfriend.

804
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,280
Who you broke up with.

805
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,750
What? I never said that.

806
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,200
You didn't need to.

807
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,250
You danced with me the whole night,

808
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,370
You said I looked beautiful

809
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,180
And now you're standing here with me

810
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,290
At the end of the dance.

811
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:31,390
I-I was walking you to your car.

812
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,300
But you looked at me like that.

813
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,430
Rhonda, however you think I was looking at you...

814
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,800
You were.

815
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,260
You told me to be honest with you.

816
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,520
Then be honest with yourself.

817
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,980
You were looking at me like that.

818
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,310
If I was...

819
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,950
I'm sorry.

820
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,780
Whatever.

821
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,070
Rhonda, wait.

822
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,550
I'm fine. I just got to go home.

823
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,470
Come in.

824
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,760
What are you doing here?

825
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,920
Um, y-your mom let me in.

826
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,320
You are such a mess, Ade

827
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,835
Okay, thanks for that.

828
00:35:34,835 --> 00:35:35,950
You're a recovering addict,

829
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,720
You're pregnant,

830
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,960
And you have what I hope

831
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,690
Is chocolates all over your face.

832
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,500
And you are a total mess.

833
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,980
And I couldn't care less.

834
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:50,120
Want to know why?

835
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,540
'Cause I was at the dance tonight...

836
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:56,410
And everything was supposed to be perfect.

837
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:59,750
But it wasn't anywhere near perfect.

838
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,280
Why?

839
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,350
Because I wasn't with you.

840
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,020
So I wanted

841
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,690
To ask you something.

842
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,780
Will you be my valentine?

843
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,450
Yeah.

844
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,150
I will.




848
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,880
Hold-hold on, I got to..


850
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,470
Look, wait, uh, class starts...

851
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,990
You-you know what? yo-you know what?

852
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,355
Uh, let's. Let's just

853
00:36:41,355 --> 00:36:42,720
Get detention for being late

854
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,890
- So we can keep doing this after school. - Okay.

855
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:45,680
Come here.

856
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,640
You... you okay?

857
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,310
Yeah.

858
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,560
No.

859
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,070
Um... I'm a little sour.

860
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,270
Well, okay, I was...

861
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,600
I was gonna wait to show it to you,

862
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,440
But... who cares!

863
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,250
Uh, wow.

864
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,250
- That's... - Your name. I know.

865
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,875
Don't you go changing it,

866
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:13,500
- Or I'm gonna be really upset. - Yeah, okay.

867
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
Um, is it... is it real?

868
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,510
Yes. I got it done

869
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,130
On sunday at this amazing

870
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,680
Tattoo parlor in Venice.

871
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,680
Come here.

872
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:25,970
I wanted to get something permanent

873
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:29,190
To symbolize our love

874
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:12,455
Okay, so, who wants to

875
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:14,600
Come up here and solve for x?

876
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,650
Sorry to interrupt-- I wanted to introduce you

877
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,400
To a student that's gonna be joining your class.

878
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,770
Uh, come on in.

879
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,560
All right, everybody, this is Liam Court.

880
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,110
Make him feel at home.

881
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,360
Or at school.

882
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,810
Anyway, carry on.

883
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,410
Please,

884
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:30,910
Take a seat.

885
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,950
Josie.

886
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:37,120
Let's have at this equation.

887
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,880
You're in high school?

888
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,040
Thanks to you.

889
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,260
What?

890
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,180
My mom had to sign for that bottle

891
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,500
Of champagne you sent over, with the little note

892
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,430
About how I was your favorite bartender.

893
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,970
Which sort of tipped her off

894
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,690
That I wasn't enrolled here.

895
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,290
Well, how was I supposed to know?

896
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:58,610
I thought you were older.

897
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:01,860
Yeah? well, right back at you.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
