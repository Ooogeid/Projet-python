1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,650
Preveviously on 90210...

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:07,470
Apparently someone has a text of you, like a naked text.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,670
Talk to your friend Naomi.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,380
She's got a copy of the picture, too.

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,480
You and me, we're done.

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,410
I made a mistake.

7
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:13,570
It doesn't mean that it's over.

8
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,260
Whatever, man, she's been lying to me all summer.

9
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,870
Now I'm free... new year, new Dixon.

10
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,390
Why did you return to Beverly Hills?

11
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,090
Maybe you were so busy sleeping around

12
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,380
that you can't remember who you did or didn't sleep with.

13
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,470
I'm a journalist.

14
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,380
Journalists don't pull punches.

15
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,780
Yeah, well, they also don't attack someone just

16
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,870
because that person used to date their girlfriend.

17
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,140
Please don't send out that picture.

18
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,490
It's going to ruin my life.

19
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,710
Naomi, what are you doing?

20
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,800
I'm sending out that text.

21
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,190
I know you think she's evil, but...

22
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,190
I don't think.

23
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,290
I know. Trust me, this...

24
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:38,970
Why?

25
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,700
Clearly you're on her side.

26
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:42,940
Nice rack.

27
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,260
I found this homeless guy.

28
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,370
He'd been mowed over by a hit-and-run driver.

29
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,960
No reason... you walked up and
clocked a guy for no reason.

30
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,080
That's not good enough.

31
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:02,520
I guess I was just having a bad day.

32
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,760
And this is how you deal with it?

33
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,370
How do you think this reflects on me, on our family?

34
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,930
You're worried about what I'm
doing to our family's reputation?

35
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,060
Really?

36
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:12,950
What about Annie?

37
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,460
Annie is not hitting people.

38
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,100
Okay...

39
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,250
fine.

40
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,760
You want to know why I did it?

41
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,560
Yes.

42
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,260
I hit that guy because he took
a topless picture of Annie

43
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,490
and sent it to everybody in the school.

44
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,310
- You should get to lunch.
- Can I go to lunch?

45
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,030
Yeah, yeah, go.

46
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,170
Go.

47
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,520
hey.

48
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:00,220
Hey, um, so I found some of your things at my place.

49
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,180
Oh, cool, thanks.

50
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,860
Yeah, just some random stuff... a few dvds,

51
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,420
oh, and, like three of your socks.

52
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,880
I have no idea how I ended up with three of your socks, 

53
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,510
but well, now they're back safe and sound with their owner.

54
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,410
That's a relief, I'm sure, for the sock community.

55
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,150
Hell's hospital.

56
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,820
Do you remember that?

57
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,650
Yeah, at that horror festival in pasadena, yeah.

58
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,070
You know, you can keep it.

59
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,350
I'm probably not gonna watch it again.

60
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,680
No way, it's yours.

61
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,680
No, honestly, it's cool.

62
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,650
Honestly, I hate horror movies.

63
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh, that's funny, 'cause we saw plenty of them.

64
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,390
Yeah, 'cause you picked every movie we went to.

65
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,420
I had to pick every movies.

66
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,090
Otherwise, we'd end up watching that
sappy sports crap that you love.

67
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,320
Well, lucky for you, that never happened.

68
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,670
I mean, we always just did what u wanted to do.

69
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,100
Every movie, every concert, every meal... all you.

70
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,720
Oh, is that right?

71
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,650
Yeah, that's right.

72
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,700
What are you saying?

73
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,230
I'm saying I was never really myself around you.

74
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,210
Well, then it's a good thing we broke up.

75
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,090
Oh!

76
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,480
- Oh, I am so sorry. 
- Ah, I'm sorry.

77
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,690
Oh, no, I'm an idiot, I'm an idiot.

78
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,680
Hey, as long as my iced coffee didn't spill.

79
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,470
I need this stuff to get through French.

80
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,780
Hey, I know you.

81
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,390
I know you... I... I know you from somewhere.

82
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,160
It's not that big a school, so...

83
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,470
No, it's not from school.

84
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,100
It's from someplace specific.

85
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,110
Man, it is right on the tip of my brain.

86
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,200
No, I've got one of those faces, you know, so...

87
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,500
Do you ever play in any tennis tournaments?

88
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,470
No.

89
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,560
Annie!

90
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,800
How about another picture?

91
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,440
Ah, right, that was...

92
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,780
Yeah, I'm that girl.

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,880
Mm, I guess that's how I recognize you.

94
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,700
I guess so.

95
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,830
Well, that awkward silence was your cue.

96
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,120
You don't have to walwith me.

97
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,310
I think we're going to the same place.

98
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,610
You know, this whole...

99
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,870
photo thing...

100
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,180
don't sweat it.

101
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,720
By tomorrow, people will be on to the next thing.

102
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,570
what are you staring at?

103
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,540
This is your fault.

104
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,410
Me?

105
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,470
I didn't write that.

106
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,020
Yeah, well, you might as well have.

107
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,620
He's such a jackass.

108
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,250
Okay, I'm nice enough to bring all of
his stuff back and he spits on me.

109
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,980
Oh, my God, Dixon spat on you?

110
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,160
Metaphorically.

111
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,890
Easy does it. You're the one spitting.

112
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,370
I am not.

113
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:02,990
Yes, you are.

114
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,480
My hamachi negi maki is soaked.

115
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,480
Such a jackass.

116
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,390
Mmm, still good, though.

117
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,130
How could you do this to me?

118
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,530
Okay, sorry.

119
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,620
I don't know what you're talking about.

120
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,400
But then again, I don't speak skank.

121
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,860
Maybe I could find an interpreter.

122
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,050
You sent out that "sext," Naomi.

123
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,830
After I personally came to you and begged you not to.

124
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,360
I begged you.

125
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,890
Why don't you save the little
scene for your acting reel, Meryl?

126
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,560
I never saw the photo before today.

127
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,020
Girls, come on.

128
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,570
Silver...

129
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,200
Got your text.

130
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,790
What, you got a new rule about

131
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,580
who I can and can't talk to in the lunchroom?

132
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,400
No, I just need yournput.

133
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,460
I'm trying to edit this piece.

134
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,190
Um, I don't...

135
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,610
Just tell me what you think.

136
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,560
Okay?

137
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,460
okay?

138
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,420
Okay.

139
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,170
So...

140
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,370
when was the last time you made
such an ass out of yourself?

141
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,450
Last Spring... maybe in chemistry... 

142
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,400
when I asked my teacher for extra assignments
over the summer to "keep things fresh."

143
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,030
It's true.

144
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,620
That's fairly standard high school ass-kissing.

145
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,500
This gaffe is much worse, isn't it?

146
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,880
I guess it is.

147
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:45,820
No, there's no guessing.

148
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,110
You were a jealous imbecile.

149
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,250
A raging lunatic, a pathetic...

150
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,710
Easy, you don't have to attack me.

151
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,730
Excuse me, but I'm a journalist and
journalists don't pull punches.

152
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,700
You must be paranoid.

153
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:56,800
So tell us, Mr. Shirazi, 

154
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,760
'cause the whole world would like to know... 

155
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,920
Why... why you couldn't control yourself.

156
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,410
Because of her. Okay?

157
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,110
Because of Adrianna.

158
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:10,120
Because she's, like, so far out of my
league that I feel like I'm dreaming.

159
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,640
She's with me?

160
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,460
Seriously?

161
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,570
I defy you to look into those eyes and not lose your mind.

162
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,080
Go on...

163
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,420
I dare you.

164
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,280
Whoa.

165
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,560
Dude.

166
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,630
I see what you mean.

167
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,170
It's true.

168
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,560
Come here.

169
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,380
Need any help?

170
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,210
I come bearing paper towels.

171
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,800
There are some real jerks in this place.

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,910
I'll say.

173
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,120
Look, I know Naomi is acting nuts around you, 

174
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,370
but it's only because she's still crazy about Liam.

175
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,690
So get over it.

176
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,990
I don't think she can.

177
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,150
She's one of the strongest people I know, 

178
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,020
and liam can just send her off the deep end.

179
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,330
I guess everybody has their weakness.

180
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,390
Why are you telling me this?

181
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,430
Because I'm sick of this whole thing.

182
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,820
I want to be your friend and want to be her friend, too.

183
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,490
No, y... you can't have it both ways.

184
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,080
She didn't send the sext.

185
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,500
Of course she sent it.

186
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,850
She said she'd never seen that picture before today.

187
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,690
Yeah, because she's lying, Silver.

188
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,740
Don't you get it?

189
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,170
She wants to screw me over.

190
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,560
I'm innocent here and she's a bitch,
and I... I'm going to prove it.

191
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,730
I am going to expose her for who she really is.

195
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:18,200
So your nut-job brother just sucker-
punched me. Almost broke my haw.

196
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,970
So I'm gonna take that as a little sign

197
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,510
that you and I probably shouldn't be hanging out.

198
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,150
Yeah, well, you're the one who did this.

199
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,550
You took the picture.

200
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,720
Okay? You have to help me.

201
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,430
Please?

202
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,130
All right, but it's going to cost you.

203
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,230
What about her shoving her box in my face, huh?

204
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,870
Sorry, what?

205
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,190
Silver and her box of socks.

206
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,610
"Here! Take this! Now"

207
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,910
That doesn't strike you as hostile?

208
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,950
Dude, maybe she just wants to give you your crap back.

209
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,480
No.

210
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,370
No, no, no.

211
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,840
All right, you're missing the point.

212
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:59,840
Okay, tha... tha... that stupid movie, the
Ramones cds, the goofy calligraphy set

213
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,940
that she wanted us to do together... all her.

214
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,350
Oh, yo, I'll take the calligraphy set.

215
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,760
I mean, if you're throwing it away.

216
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,020
I was so whipped.

217
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,350
So whipped.

218
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,600
But you know what?

219
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,580
The past is the past.

220
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,450
My next woman... she's gonna be all about the d-man.

221
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,170
I'm going to find me a female Dixon.

222
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,580
Okay, I'm picturing the start of a very bad Tyler Perry flick.

223
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,900
Hey, guys.

224
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,920
What up, t?

225
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,780
Teddy.

226
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,730
So there's going to be this party
on my dad's yacht this Saturday.

227
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,670
The weather should be nice, so... I
know, late notice and all, but, uh...

228
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,770
What do you say?

229
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,790
Well, actually, Navid and I... we have plans.

230
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,720
Well, we'll reschedule.

231
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,900
Uh, no... party sounds awesome, dude.

232
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,040
Thanks for the invite, man.

233
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:47,700
Cool, man.

234
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,270
Navid.

235
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,060
I thought you hated that guy.

236
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:52,880
Yeah, not a fan.

237
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,370
I thought he was a sleazeball.

238
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,200
Huge sleazeball.

239
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,020
I mean, that story about him nailing those girls at Exeter?

240
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,640
He's a pig.

241
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,330
So we're going to his party on Saturday because...

242
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,140
Because Adrianna likes him and I love Adrianna.

243
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,020
And if I act all jealous in front of her,
then it's only going to drive her away.

244
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,340
It's psych 101, dude.

245
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,070
I need to reassure her by being super-tight with Teddy.

246
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,300
Operation overcompensate.

247
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,370
Watch and learn.

248
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,530
Yeah, um, okay.

249
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,180
Look, I'm breezing before your, uh, geek squad shows up.

250
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,340
Oh, damn, dude, the Blaze meeting.

251
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,030
I spaced on time.

252
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,180
I didn't even order the pizzas.

253
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,130
I was too busy listening to you gripe about Silver.

254
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,560
I'm not gonna get the pizzas.

255
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,680
Totally understand, dude.

256
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,170
Guess I'll find someone else who
wants to drive the Lambo.

257
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,660
Hey, uh, let me have three pizzas.

258
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,530
Uh, two pepperoni and one with anchovies.

259
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,680
Safe!

260
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,440
Safe!

261
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,550
He missed the tag!

262
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,530
Yes!

263
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,550
Oh, yes!

264
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,440
baseball fan, huh?

265
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:05,030
Oh, I go through some serious withdrawal in October.

266
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,170
Oh, tell me about it.

267
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,960
After that last yankee game of the
season I walk around in a daze.

268
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,130
Yankees?

269
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,160
$200 million payroll and you still can't catch Boston?

270
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,180
Oh, please don't tell me you're a Red Sox fan.

271
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,360
Oh, hell, no.

272
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,710
I grew up a mile from Camden Yards.

273
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,100
Baltimore?

274
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,320
Oh...

275
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,310
geez, girl, please, come out from the cellar and get some air.

276
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,120
12 straight losing seasons?

277
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,560
We're young, okay?

278
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,350
And we're building.

279
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,280
We're young, look at, look at, uh, Jones, 24, Reimold, 25.

280
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,360
- I mean, your starting pitching's still a mess.
- Yeah.

281
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,840
But we have talent coming up within the system, okay?

282
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,140
Oh, wait, wait, who's this talking about minor league ball?

283
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:52,240
Oh, yeah, it's the girl with no post-season
contender in the bigs... no, no, it's okay, though.

284
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,700
It's okay, you know, I'm focused on October.

285
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,520
I'm Dixon, by the way.

286
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,400
Hi, Dixon, I'm Sasha.

287
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,310
Nice to meet you.

288
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,570
Nice to meet you.

289
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,390
Being intimate with someone is a big deal, Annie.

290
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,470
Did you...

291
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,130
I mean, you didn't, did you?

292
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,640
No, I did not do it with him, if that's what you're asking.

293
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,130
Okay, but you did do something.

294
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,950
And I'll tell you something Annie,
this world isn't always fair to women.

295
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,935
If you're sexually active with a
guy that you don't care about, 

296
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:26,657
it's not going to hurt his reputation, 

297
00:13:26,658 --> 00:13:27,790
it's going to hurt yours.

298
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,260
this is real, annie.

299
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,060
This is your life we're talking about.

300
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,550
Look, don't take your bitterness out on me just
'cause you've had like no sexual experience.

301
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,800
Annie, that's enough.

302
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:37,420
You're grounded.

303
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,550
Fine.

304
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,460
Harry...

305
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,530
No, I am sick of this.

306
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,740
This is stopping today.

307
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,830
Why do you always swoop in and save
me when I'm dealing with the kids?

308
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,270
I don't need to be saved.

309
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,800
No, I'm not gonna let her talk to you like that.

310
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,100
Harry, you always do this.

311
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,220
You know what you alwayso?

312
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,630
You always try to be their friend.

313
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,760
Sometimes they don't need a
friend, they need a parent.

314
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,270
Dude, where did you go for pizza, Big Sur?

315
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,780
Listen, listen, I'm telling you, I
just met my dream girl, okay?

316
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,140
She's like the female Dixon.

317
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,260
That is never going to sound sexy.

318
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,280
She go to West Bev?

319
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,150
No, no, no, um, Archer?

320
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,790
Crossroads, maybe.

321
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,710
Uh, I don't know but look, I gotta go.

322
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,660
I gotta go, I gotta go, bye, bye.

323
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,060
Ugh, one second.

324
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,710
What?

325
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,580
Okay, all right, I heard you the third time.

326
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:31,610
Extra cheese.

327
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,430
Bye.

328
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,700
Nice ringtone.

329
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,350
Thank you, thank you.

330
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,240
You the, you the best likewise.

331
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,000
You the, you the best you the, you the best...

332
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:43,790
Hey.

333
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:44,650
Yeah.

334
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,770
Where's the gig?

335
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,340
They, they the same people who
hired me for the HBO party?

336
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,000
And I'm the only dj?

337
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,350
Okay, yeah, yeah, cool.

338
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,150
I'll be there.

339
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,020
All right, bye.

340
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,100
Wow!

341
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,510
So you dj?

342
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,130
I do.

343
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,370
That's pretty cool, seriously.

344
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,640
You know, I've always wanted to try it myself.

345
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,940
So how long you been at it?

346
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,390
Uh, let's see.

347
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,040
I started spinning in college, then I had my
first paying gig the summer after I graduated.

348
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,760
And full time since then.

349
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,920
Wow.

350
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,730
Wow.

351
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,050
So, when am I going to see you again?

352
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,210
Uh...

353
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,800
how about this weekend?

354
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,690
I got a gig on Saturday.

355
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,830
But Sunday's open.

356
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,550
Okay, Sunday it is.

357
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,680
Okay, cool.

358
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,360
Let me give you my digits.

359
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,720
All right.

360
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,270
One second, let me just, uh...

361
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,590
Thanks.

362
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,310
Nice ride.

363
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,440
Um, it gets me where I need to go.

364
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,430
So, Sunday.

365
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,370
Sunday.

366
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,530
Don't forget! Sunday.

367
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,680
Hotter than beyonce, huh?

368
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,530
Most definitely.

369
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,780
What about Megan Fox?

370
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,290
Whew.

371
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,750
Sasha blows her away.

372
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,620
Golshifteh Farahani?

373
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,090
Oh, come on, dude... Santori, Divar?

374
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,900
Bab'aziz, remember?

375
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:38,690
Dudes, you just need to see some more Iranian movies.

376
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:45,710
So, seriously guys, uh, I need to take her
somewhere that'll really impress her.

377
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,050
The grove's nice.

378
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:47,960
No!

379
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,100
All right, dude.

380
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,360
Sasha's a grown woman.

381
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,580
She's gonna want something
a little more sophisticated.

382
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,970
Then what's she doing with you?

383
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,190
Ooh-hoo!

384
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,470
Oh-ho!

385
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,470
Wow!

386
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,350
Was that a joke?

387
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,070
Yeah, that was, I think that was a joke.

388
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,590
Yore in high school.

389
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,050
Yeah? And?

390
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,230
And she doesn't know you're in high school.

391
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:06,960
Yeah.

392
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,430
Okay.

393
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,660
Okay.

394
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,640
You ever just consider telling her the truth?

395
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,390
You know, maybe if you level with her...

396
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:15,960
Easy there, nature boy.

397
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,740
All right?

398
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,130
This isn't one of your campfire honesty sessions.

399
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,420
This is the real world.

400
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,380
I'm going to be straight with
her, but when the time's right.

401
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,960
But until then, can I just bask in
my present glory, please?

402
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:29,800
Go ahead.

403
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:30,600
Bask away. I got to go.

404
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,360
All I did was defend her.

405
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:37,790
Turns out that's a bad thing.

406
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:38,690
I... I don't know.

407
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,320
Well, I'm sure that that you and Debbie will figure it out.

408
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,480
Yeah, yeah.

409
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,450
Anyway, I grounded Annie.

410
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,110
You think that I can't detect nonverbal disapproval?

411
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,990
I have two teens at home.

412
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,040
Was it Annie's fault that some jerk snapped her picture?

413
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,410
Well, I think it was her bad judgment
that put her in that situation, 

414
00:18:02,411 --> 00:18:03,940
so shouldn't there be consequences?

415
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,420
I mean, I know punishment's a dirty word these days, but...

416
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,800
every kid in the school has seen that text.

417
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:10,520
Maybe she's been punished enough.

418
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,090
I'm...

419
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,010
I'm not sure.

420
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,610
I'm not sure of anything these days.

421
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,660
Don't be so hard on yourself, Harry.

422
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,280
All I can say is, I am glad there were no
camera phone things when I was here...

423
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,060
You were pretty crazy, huh?

424
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:32,740
I, uh...

425
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,360
I pretty much foreshadowed
the whole girls gone wild craze.

426
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,570
Oh.

427
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,344
Red light love makes my heart stop

428
00:18:44,345 --> 00:18:48,859
drives me so crazy I can't even walk

429
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:58,140
I got a red light love hoping every day he don't green light go...

430
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,180
could probably solve the state budget crisis with what this stupid yacht costs.

431
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,360
I know!

432
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,970
And to think I was actually impressed
by Usher's speedboat last summer.

433
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,650
Oh, my God.

434
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,860
Has she no shame?

435
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,370
You know, I don't think this is such a good idea.

436
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,300
Would you relax?

437
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,550
It's going to be painless, okay?

438
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,130
And don't forget about our agreement.

439
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,090
I think I might be adding to our little contract.

440
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

441
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:32,530
Nobody knows how I used to be but I remember...

442
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,620
Welcome aboard.

443
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,130
Guys.

444
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,650
How's it going, homeboy?

445
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,720
Ah.

446
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,620
So glad you could make it.

447
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,180
Yeah, yeah.

448
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,550
Dude, there's no place I'd rather be.

449
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,685
You probably have a lot of people to see, 

450
00:19:54,686 --> 00:19:56,040
so I think we're just going to go walk...

451
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,020
Hey, not so fast.

452
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,930
Don't you want the tour?

453
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,220
We want...

454
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,550
we want to see everything, bro.

455
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,690
Don't leave out a single seat cushion.

456
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,970
Yo, this is a nightmare.

457
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,330
First time Sasha sees me, she thinks I'm Jay Z.

458
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:14,280
Now she sees me again, and I'm at a high
school party with an angry ex-girlfriend.

459
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,530
What am I going to do?

460
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,390
How good of a swimmer are you?

461
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,060
Right.

462
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,780
Look, Dix.

463
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,910
You want to go through with this, we got your back.

464
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,210
We'll play into your story.

465
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,520
Yeah, we'll say we're old high school buddies.

466
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,360
Wait.

467
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,220
What about Silver?

468
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,300
Obviously, we have to kill Ssilver.

469
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,130
Dude, that was...

470
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,970
That was a joke man. I'm playing.

471
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,290
All we have to do is just make
sure silver does not meet Sasha.

472
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,670
- All right?
- That's no problem.

473
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
Piece of cake.

474
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,670
All right, I can do this.

475
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,950
- You can do this.
- You can do this.

476
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,080
I can do this.

477
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,370
I can do this.

478
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,550
Dixon?!

479
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,300
Sasha?

480
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,170
What are you doing here?

481
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,360
I'm working the party. What...

482
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,310
Are you friends with...

483
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,850
Y... yeah, the, the Montgomerys.

484
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,140
- Ah...
- Yeah, yeah.

485
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,830
So, uh, you know, uh, while you're on the job, 

486
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:11,090
is there any rules against you mixing with the guests?

487
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,380
None that I can remember.

488
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,550
Okay.

489
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,440
You said you alway wanted to try dj-ing, right?

490
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,180
Yeah, yeah, you know, I thought
it would be a nice way to, 

491
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,000
to, you know, uh, chill, to relax.

492
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,580
To relax?

493
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,960
When you're not...

494
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,380
I'm sorry, huh?

495
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,970
What do you do for a living?

496
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,200
Oh...

497
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,530
you know, I'm...

498
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,710
I'm in the music business.

499
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,970
I'm, I'm an exec.

500
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,170
Well, Mr. Big exec, you want
to be my assistant for a few?

501
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,170
- Try matching some beats?
- Yeah, sure.

502
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,210
- Yeah?
- Definitely.

503
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,180
All right, go easy now.

504
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:57,060
Adjust the pitch control of both tables.

505
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,080
Uh-huh, and get a feel for moving the cross fader.

506
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,230
Uh-huh, that's it.

507
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,180
Not bad at all.

508
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,480
Ah, I love the feeling of being on the ocean.

509
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,550
It totally turns me on.

510
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,600
Ew, Naomi.

511
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,600
Suddenly I feel seasick.

512
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,620
Hi, Silver.

513
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,780
Tell her.

514
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,590
Naomi texted herself the photo from my phone.

515
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,450
She practically grabbed it out of my hand.

516
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,820
Shut up, you goon.

517
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,670
Later.

518
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,410
Naomi, you said you'd never seen the picture before.

519
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,280
Oh, because she'd never be
untruthful, now, would she?

520
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,190
Did you do this?

521
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,410
Okay, listen, I had every right to.

522
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,610
She slept with my guy and sh...

523
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,500
Whatever... okay, look, I told you that
I was going to prove this to you, 

524
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,350
so see, I'm a good person
and she's a lying sociopath.

525
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,920
Just wanted to set the record straight.

526
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:09,190
I can't even deal with you two.

527
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,530
Silver, wait. Silver.

528
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,270
You think you won this little battle?

529
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,450
Guess what, honey? You just started a war.

530
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,000
She's on Spence Montgomery's yacht?

531
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:29,110
Well, she was all, "wow, big
movie star party. Please."

532
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:29,980
I... I get it.

533
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,350
What happened to the whole
"kids need a parent" argument?

534
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,300
What happened to consequences?

535
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:37,450
Well, I was talking with Kelly
at school, and I came around.

536
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,270
- You and Kelly discussed this?
- Yeah.

537
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,100
She's smart about these things.

538
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,480
I don't know, maybe it's 'cause
she's a guidance counselor

539
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,370
and she deals with these kids 24/7, 

540
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,700
but she thought maybe Annie
had been punished enough.

541
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,370
Unbelievable.

542
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,000
What?

543
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,230
You can't hear it from me, 

544
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,250
but Kelly says the exact same thing

545
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,520
and it comes through loud and clear.

546
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,630
You know, I... I can't stand this.

547
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,860
I can't live this way; it's not fair.

548
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,310
Whoa, what is going on?

549
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,200
Take it easy.

550
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,660
Don't tell me to take it easy.

551
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,960
If you just had the guts to
tell Naomi who you slept with, 

552
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,360
none of this would be happening.

553
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:21,770
Look, I told you I can't do anything about that.

554
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,780
Yeah, you can.

555
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,060
I can't do this anymore.

556
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,190
I'm ending this today.

557
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,910
Okay, I'm not about to fight
some war that I can't win.

558
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,640
It's easy.

559
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:34,480
We just go to Naomi together, tell her the truth.

560
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,460
We're innocent.

561
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,010
We didn't have sex.

562
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,890
She needs to know that.

563
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,960
You owe me this.

564
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,880
Great party.

565
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,800
What's wrong?

566
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:19,510
Some chick with short black hair
keeps giving me the stink eye.

567
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,320
Uh, okay, look, uh, here's the deal.

568
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,490
That, that girl... she's my ex.

569
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,580
I di't know she was going to be here
today or anything, you know, but...

570
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,430
we're cool, it's cool.

571
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,850
You going to introduce me to her?

572
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,710
We're not that cool, no, but, um...

573
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,790
You know, she didn't take the breakup that well, 

574
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,630
so, you know, it'd be best if you just...

575
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:49,110
keep your distance, you know.

576
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,550
Yeah.

577
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,140
Naomi.

578
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,110
Ugh, what do you two want?

579
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:14,060
We need to tell you the truth about that night, Naomi.

580
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,270
Prom night.

581
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,590
We totally slept together.

582
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,970
- But it wasn't the first time, 
- What?

583
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,780
we've actually been having sex the whole time

584
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,180
that you guys were together,
which is just not right, okay?

585
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,050
What are you doing?

586
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,280
No, Liam, we promised that we'd get all of this out.

587
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,660
- All right, you can't go back on me now.
- Naomi, she's lying to you.

588
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,910
No, no!

589
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,900
And the worst part that I feel so, so
bad about is after we'd have sex, 

590
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:41,490
we'd actually just kind of lie
there making fun of you for hours.

591
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,750
It's kind of funny though.

592
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,550
I mean even you love ends up loving me more.

593
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,820
First Ethan, then Liam.

594
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,210
Who's gonna be next?

595
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:16,960
You done good, bro.

596
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,310
Oh, my goodness, man.

597
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,530
I am pinching myself.

598
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,170
Oh, man, I wish this boat would settle down, man.

599
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:27,240
All right, guys, we're gonna take a little
break now so y'all can check out the sunset.

600
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,480
Dixon!

601
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,830
Hey, Dixon!

602
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,430
Everything okay?

603
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.

604
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,810
- Actually, um, I gotta go handle something really fast.
- Okay.

605
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,810
Uh, so I'll be right back.

606
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,900
But this is Navid.

607
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,800
- Oh, hi.
- Hi, Navid.

608
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,220
- Nice to meet you, Sasha.
- Nice to meet you, yeah.

609
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,740
Navid is my assistant.

610
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:56,880
Yeah.

611
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,590
Anything you need, he'll be glad to help.

612
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,340
Right?

613
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:02,970
Just keep her away from Silver.

614
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,730
Uh, yeah, you got it, boss.

615
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,620
Thanks, man. See you in a minute.

616
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:11,470
Can I get you a beverage,
bottled water or something?

617
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,500
Liam, what the hell is going on?

618
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,480
I could kill her, I swear to God.

619
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,620
She totally blindsided me!

620
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,700
Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

621
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,720
Who are you talking about?

622
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,550
Who blindsided you?

623
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,880
Your psycho sister.

624
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,100
I can't take it.

625
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:23,150
I can't take it.

626
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,020
So, what's he really like as a boss?

627
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,340
You know, off the record.

628
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:40,760
He's, a, uh, the nicest guy
you could ever work for.

629
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,490
Are you okay?

630
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,150
Do you...

631
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,620
Whoa, buddy, you are looking a little green.

632
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,230
This could go real bad real fast, okay?

633
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,860
Yeah, I know, come on.

634
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:03,210
The stern is where you want to be right now.

635
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,200
Club soda, please.

636
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,820
So, are you here with Dixon?

637
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,530
Yes, well, no.

638
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,130
- Which one?
- I didn't come with him.

639
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,740
But I met him before.

640
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,390
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

641
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,530
How long ago?

642
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,740
Just the other night.

643
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,300
Thanks.

644
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,700
He seems like a great guy.

645
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:33,270
Yeah, he does seem like that.

646
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,480
I'm Sasha.

647
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,350
Silver.

648
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,800
Are you in the music business like Dixon?

649
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,870
No.

650
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,110
No, I'm not.

651
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:53,240
Look, just pick a point on the
horizon and take deep breaths.

652
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,490
Look, I'm fine.

653
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,020
Besides, I don't think there's an audience
here to cheer you on for playing nurse, 

654
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,940
so you can get back to the party.

655
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,160
You don't like me, do you?

656
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,890
This is not a junior high girl question.

657
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,940
I'm serious.

658
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,280
What are you talking about, man?

659
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,930
Come on, all the eye rolls, the sarcasm... 

660
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,090
- What's your problem?
- Okay for real, dude, 

661
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,650
you strike me as kind of a sleaze.

662
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,620
Why, 'cause I like the ladies?

663
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:22,360
Well, yeah, partly and because
you use terms like "the ladies."

664
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,960
It's your whole persona, man.

665
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:26,380
It's like that story you told in the interview

666
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,670
about the two freshman girls at Exeter.

667
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,640
"Oh, uh, I never kiss and tell."

668
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:33,310
"Oh, that's all so amusing, my friend."

669
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,800
Okay, off the record?

670
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,370
It wasn't me.

671
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,760
I didn't even know those girls to say hi to.

672
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,070
Yeah, I don't follow you.

673
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,560
The girls at Exeter.

674
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,100
They were with my idiot roommate.

675
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,060
But you got kicked out.

676
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,270
He was a scholarship kid.

677
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,660
He really loved the school.

678
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:57,600
Wait, so you're saying that you
took the fall for your roommate?

679
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,010
I wanted to come home anyway.

680
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,900
But in the Blaze interview, why
didn't you clear your name?

681
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,620
Because he'd still get booted if anyone found out.

682
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,910
Wow.

683
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,910
Forget about it.

684
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:20,170
You're a good guy.

685
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,560
I cannot believe you lived through that.

686
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,980
I know. My God!

687
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,530
- Amazing!
- It was hilarious.

688
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,580
So, you ladies have met?

689
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,790
- Yeah, yep.
- Yeah.

690
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:35,460
I was just telling Silver how
cool it was to meet a guy

691
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,740
I had so much in common with.

692
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,590
Yeah, I mean, you both love baseball, 

693
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,300
you're both in the music business.

694
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:45,570
Yeah, well, I'm not as successful as Dixon is.

695
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,240
But, I mean, a Lamborghini?

696
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,350
Come on, get out of town.

697
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,430
Oh, man, I didn't know you were driving a Lambo.

698
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,060
Better mileage.

699
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,360
I'm gonna let you guys have some alone time.

700
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,770
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.

701
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:16,490
And, um, I'm so glad that you finally found
someone you can really be yourself with.

702
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:24,090
Poor Navid. I can't believe he seasick.

703
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,090
Relax. He's fine now.

704
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,610
Oh, man, I wish my dad could have seen you today.

705
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,140
He's still not showing up to his own parties?

706
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,250
Paramount practically had to kidnap him to

707
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,120
make sure he showed up to accept his first oscar.

708
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:41,030
- I believe it.
- Yeah

709
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,870
Still know your way around the boat, huh?

710
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,180
Uh, I guess so.

711
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,480
God... do you remember your first time here?

712
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,420
Sort of.

713
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,240
You had just finished wrapping
that indie film in New York.

714
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,600
And you'd just lost that really big tennis tournament, 

715
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:01,220
and you were sort of down, remember?

716
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:05,830
I think the clinical term for it is suicidal, but, yeah.

717
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,860
Suicidal, yes.

718
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:12,100
And then you cheered me up with a promise.

719
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,320
Remember what you said?

720
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:17,030
I'm going to see you play at Wimbledon someday?

721
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,390
Uh, yep.

722
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:20,610
That's it.

723
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,180
I remember.

724
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:29,010
We were hungry, and we both
ended up down here, and...

725
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:33,820
and before we knew what was happening, we...

726
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:36,580
had our very first...

727
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:46,530
Uh, yeah, I should, um, go give this to my boyfriend.

728
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,270
Yeah.

729
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,080
Yeah.

730
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,000
That was some party.

731
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,770
- Yeah, it was okay.
- No, and Teddy's awesome.

732
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,380
For real, Ade.

733
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,280
A real stand-up guy.

734
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,120
And I... I think we're gonna be great friends.

735
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,070
- That's so cool.
- Yeah.

736
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,610
Of all the pizza joints in
all the towns in all the world, 

737
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,670
you just had to walk into mine.

738
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,390
Oh, my God, Casablanca...

739
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,330
Is the best...

740
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,700
Oh, movie ever.

741
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,350
- But you know what?
- What?

742
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,840
I was there first.

743
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,820
Yeah, you walked into my pizza joint.

744
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:40,480
Okay, okay, well, uh, we'll always have pizza.

745
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,100
Look, if you want me to leave, I...

746
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:57,170
- Stay. I don't care.
- Okay.

747
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,310
Guess you hate me, too.

748
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,730
God knows everybody else does.

749
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,800
I don't hate you.

750
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,090
I mean, sending that text was nasty.

751
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,190
The way you treat Annie is...

752
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,550
psycho.

753
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:12,260
And watching me defend you when you
knew that you were lying really sucks.

754
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,250
Wait. This is your way of
saying you don't hate me?

755
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,720
You're a piece of work, Nay.

756
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:21,640
When I saw how Annie attacked you on the boat...

757
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,460
it was so cruel.

758
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,560
All of a sudden, I couldn't really blame you.

759
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:30,500
Thanks.

760
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,880
Maybe annie's right.

761
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,570
Everyone I loved did wind up loving her more.

762
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,630
I don't know if I'll ever find anyone.

763
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,900
Are you kidding me?

764
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,220
You're Naomi Clark.

765
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,070
You rule West Bev.

766
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,920
Snap your fingers, and you
can have anyone you want.

767
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:51,380
There's no one more confident, more popular.

768
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,290
Confident?

769
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,440
No, no, that's you.

770
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,760
You're the one who doesn't give
a crap what the crowd thinks.

771
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,380
You're the true original.

772
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:01,260
Yeah, that's why I do things like...

773
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,060
I went to have it removed yesterday.

774
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:15,940
I found out it takes seven
sessions and eight months.

775
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,370
- It still hurts?
- Yeah.

776
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,370
More than I realized.

777
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:27,490
'Cause it takes a long time
to make someone fade away.

778
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:31,270
Is it true he's here with some older chick?

779
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,310
Sasha.

780
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:37,960
Who thinks that he's a music
exec with a $200, 000 car.

781
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:40,290
And I just...

782
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,310
Played along.

783
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,230
It's pathetic, huh?

784
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,950
I thout I was over him, but here I am.

785
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,900
Are you crazy?

786
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,910
Can't you see how much progress you made today?

787
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,160
You could have totally busted him back there.

788
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,260
The chick gave you a loaded gun.

789
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,750
I mean, me... I would have at least grazed him.

790
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,290
You're amazing.

791
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,990
I could have broken his arms.

792
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:03,810
See what I mean?

793
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,730
You're practically Mrs. Gael Garcia Bernal.

794
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,570
Okay, now, that has a nice ring to it.

795
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,820
See? You'll be over him in no time.

796
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,380
You're doing great.

797
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,800
So are you, you know.

798
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,280
Well, I'm gonna turn in. Good night.

799
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,740
Night, hon.

800
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,950
You free for lunch?

801
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,030
You know what we should do?

802
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,390
We should throw Teddy a party.

803
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,350
It could be a "welcome back to socal."

804
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,850
We could do it at my place.

805
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,970
- Maybe.
- Yeah?

806
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,580
Hey, guys.

807
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,900
- Navid?
- Yes?

808
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,260
I kind of sort of need to borrow the car.

809
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,530
You know, you're kind of a douche to work for.

810
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,290
I know. I owe you.

811
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,530
- Okay.
- Thanks, man.

812
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,970
Hey.

813
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:28,930
So...

814
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,730
So...?

815
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:33,710
Well, you owe me, right?

816
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,350
A deal's a deal.

817
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,910
All right.

818
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,890
Uh, give me just sec, okay?

819
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,850
I'll meet you outside.

820
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:34,890
Want to see how she feels?

821
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,130
Why not?

822
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:58,550
Alright, look, no traffic, this puppy
can get us to Beverly Hills in about...

823
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,290
7 minutes.

824
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,580
Oh yeah, too bad we're not going to Beverly Hills.

825
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:04,310
Wait. That's where I live.

826
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,590
It's still the weekend.

827
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,860
Wasn't our date supposed to be tomorrow?

828
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:08,560
Yeah, but... 

829
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:11,300
Well, it started early then.

830
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,380
You may want to click that.

831
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,720
Cause we're going in now, bud.
