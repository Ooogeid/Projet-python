"Priviously and <i>90210.</i>"

2
00:00:03,024 --> 00:00:05,405
Come on.
This is gonna be fun!

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,525
We got the weather. We got the he...
the palm trees with...

4
00:00:08,618 --> 00:00:10,092
<i>More Palm trees.</i>

5
00:00:10,294 --> 00:00:12,090
You had, like, a million friends.

6
00:00:12,197 --> 00:00:14,422
Back hom.
And they all knew, you know?

7
00:00:14,554 --> 00:00:16,255
About the whole adoption story.

8
00:00:16,402 --> 00:00:18,906
Ethan, this is Annie,
the new principal's daughter.

9
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:20,361
Annie, my boyfriend Ethan.

10
00:00:20,418 --> 00:00:24,027
Yeah, actually, we-we know each other.
Yeah. We met, like, two summers ago?

11
00:00:24,138 --> 00:00:26,505
I'm not talking to you at the guidance
counselor right now.

12
00:00:26,524 --> 00:00:28,055
I am talking to you as your sister.

13
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,038
You've got to let go of that anger.
It's not doing you any good.

14
00:00:31,143 --> 00:00:32,872
You don't want to end up like Mom.

15
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:36,053
Everybody's seen it, Ethan!
Everyone knows!

16
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:39,975
I hurt you, you hurt me.
Is that how it works with us?

17
00:00:39,976 --> 00:00:41,475
Are you breaking up with me?

18
00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:42,835
I'm breaking up with us.

19
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:45,028
Want to grab dinner tonight
after rehearsal?

20
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:49,261
This night is
nothing like I thought it would be.

21
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,541
We had fun.
At the very least, we'll be friends.

22
00:00:54,017 --> 00:00:55,169
Are we friends?

23
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:09,471
- Thanks, hon.
- Pancakes!

24
00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:11,490
- Throw me one.
- We do not throw food.

25
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,489
Deb, bana.

26
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:14,917
- Thank you.
- I would like everybody to sit.

27
00:01:14,976 --> 00:01:17,824
Can't. Got to meet Silver before school.
We have an English project to finish.

28
00:01:17,865 --> 00:01:19,339
The one about modern poetry?

29
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,100
No. I handed that in a couple weeks ago.

30
00:01:21,138 --> 00:01:23,007
I got to be at work early.
I can drop you off.

31
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:24,810
No, thanks, Dad.
Navid's picking us up.

32
00:01:24,847 --> 00:01:27,141
- I've got rehearsal until 8:00.
- I can pick you up tonight.

33
00:01:27,178 --> 00:01:29,617
No, Silver's gonna give me a ride?
I won't be home for dinner.

34
00:01:29,674 --> 00:01:30,864
Me, too. Peace.

35
00:01:31,113 --> 00:01:34,276
Me, three. I've got a late meeting
with the teachers' union.

36
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:36,116
Always a joy.

37
00:01:49,162 --> 00:01:49,843
Hey.

38
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:57,030
So what, you're...
ignoring me now?

39
00:01:57,257 --> 00:01:59,978
No, not at all.
How can I help you?

40
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:04,358
I just...
you know, wanted to...

41
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,913
- see how you were doing.
- I'm doing great.

42
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:10,316
Thanks for asking.

43
00:02:10,817 --> 00:02:13,589
Is there gonna be anything else?
Because I really have to get to class,

44
00:02:13,647 --> 00:02:16,555
and I have to make plans for tomorrow
because my dad's taking me to Vegas.

45
00:02:16,765 --> 00:02:18,239
So you're doing that again?

46
00:02:18,695 --> 00:02:21,157
Yeah. Of course.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

47
00:02:21,365 --> 00:02:23,320
Anyway,
Coldplay's performing.

48
00:02:23,358 --> 00:02:25,511
My dad's company's going all out.

49
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:26,668
Sounds like fun.

50
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:29,133
It's gonna be awesome.

51
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:43,529
If I don't see you,
I don't know you're late.

52
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:46,232
If I don't know you're late,
I don't have to give you a late slip.

53
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,514
You're looking a little run-down, kiddo.

54
00:02:48,634 --> 00:02:51,091
Yeah, well,
run-down is totally in right now.

55
00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:53,368
It's chic to look post-rehab,
didn't you know?

56
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:56,838
No, I didn't know. But I thought
brushing your hair was cool.

57
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,957
- But then, again, I guess I'm old.
- Yeah.

58
00:02:58,998 --> 00:03:01,234
Yeah. You are getting up there.
Got to go.

59
00:03:02,627 --> 00:03:04,712
Get to class, Silver.
You're lateagain.

60
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:07,347
I trust you gave her a late slip.

61
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:09,109
Hell, no.
She's my sister.

62
00:03:09,224 --> 00:03:12,277
- Really? Nepotism?
- Yeah, you got a problem with that?

63
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:15,392
Yeah, actually. Maybe we should discuss
it tomorrow night over dinner.

64
00:03:15,764 --> 00:03:16,539
Okay.

65
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:21,372
Hey, guys, I wanted
to ask you a little something, my dad's

66
00:03:21,447 --> 00:03:23,753
screening the new Bond movie
tomorrow night at my place.

67
00:03:23,809 --> 00:03:25,970
I wish he'd screen
one of his other movies.

68
00:03:26,798 --> 00:03:27,705
No, seriously,

69
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:30,712
it's not out yet. He knows a guy
that did a little something on the film.

70
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:33,281
So I was wondering,
do you guys want to see a movie?

71
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:34,731
Is your mom gonna be there?

72
00:03:36,493 --> 00:03:37,967
Yeah, she is gonna be there.

73
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,180
- Yo, E, you in?
- Yeah. Why not?

74
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,760
I got nothing better to do.

75
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:44,268
I'm free,
single...

76
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,940
- Miserable.
- And, Horny.

77
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:50,697
Well, I mean,
as long as your mom's gonna be there.

78
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:54,818
Hey.

79
00:03:54,946 --> 00:03:55,740
Hi.

80
00:03:55,882 --> 00:03:58,093
So, are your parents still
pissed I took you on a plane?

81
00:03:58,169 --> 00:03:59,511
They'll get over it.

82
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:02,665
- So, want to go out tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow night?

83
00:04:02,737 --> 00:04:05,987
New band playing at the pier, it's
gonna be pretty sick, if you want to go.

84
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah, I would love to.

85
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:09,865
Great.
8:00?

86
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:10,940
Great.

87
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:12,133
All right.

88
00:04:13,764 --> 00:04:14,381
Yes!

89
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:17,966
If you get my mother to the chiropractor

90
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:20,396
on Saturday,
I told the board that I could meet.

91
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:22,730
Harry, I can't help but feel
that since we moved here

92
00:04:22,772 --> 00:04:24,681
none of us has time
for each other anymore.

93
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:27,277
What? No.
Sweetheart, just, we're finding our way.

94
00:04:27,315 --> 00:04:29,060
You know, new city, new jobs.

95
00:04:29,306 --> 00:04:33,086
I know, I know, but I really
miss doing things together, all of us.

96
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,807
And I know exactly what we need to do.

97
00:04:37,647 --> 00:04:40,310
- Family night?
- You-you want us to go bowling?

98
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:41,354
Yeah.

99
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,911
Your dad and I would like
to spend some time with you guys.

100
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:46,580
I feel like we don't
see each other anymore.

101
00:04:47,297 --> 00:04:51,122
And... and we really,
really want to hang out with you guys.

102
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:53,762
Especiallyon a Friday night.

103
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,020
But...
I have a date with Ty tomorrow night.

104
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:59,927
And Navid's dad is showing
the new Bond movie. Come on.

105
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:03,949
Well, your dad and I have tickets to
the Hollywood Bowl, but we're not going.

106
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,883
No, we're not.

107
00:05:04,915 --> 00:05:07,030
Because we want to
spend time with you guys.

108
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,889
- Come on, please.
- Come on, guys.

109
00:05:08,952 --> 00:05:10,198
Please? Like...

110
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:13,710
Dad, nobody does family night here.
You know?

111
00:05:13,894 --> 00:05:17,235
Well, then we are just gonna have to
bring a little Kansas to Beverly Hills

112
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,389
because we are

113
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:21,549
having family night tomorrow night,
and we are gonna have fun.

114
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,306

Can I stay again tonight?
Just one more night, I promise.

00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:11,481
I'm sorry, Silver.
We're full.

121
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,996
I need the space for people
who really don't have any place to go.

122
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:16,913
Look, you don't know
what it's like there.

I know, baby,
but you got to work it out.

I'm sorry.

125
00:06:28,781 --> 00:06:31,224
I hear there's this new band
playing tonight at the pier.

126
00:06:31,243 --> 00:06:32,463
I'm going to Vegas.

127
00:06:32,578 --> 00:06:34,278
You're doing that again?

128
00:06:34,515 --> 00:06:37,976
My dad's firm throws this celebrity golf
tournament every year. Huge party.

129
00:06:38,103 --> 00:06:41,199
- Oh, my God, it's so much fun.
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.

130
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:43,724
He's only four, and he's already
reading all these words.

131
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:45,676
And I'm sure this is
really boring to you?

132
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:48,658
No, no, it's, you know, it's your son,
it's fascinating.

133
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:51,463
I love kids, you know?
I teach kids, I...

134
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:55,353
flunk kids, I want to
strangle 'em sometimes, but that's...

135
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:59,645
I'm curious, Ryan.
How many of your friends have kids?

136
00:07:00,692 --> 00:07:02,923
Yeah, let me think, about none...

137
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:04,937
Actually. But, you know,

138
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:08,061
I'm really close with the kids I work
with at Juvie, so does that count?

139
00:07:08,176 --> 00:07:09,937
You work with kids at juvenile hall?

140
00:07:09,986 --> 00:07:13,268
Yeah, yeah, just on weekends and,
Mondays after school, Tuesdays...

141
00:07:15,428 --> 00:07:18,923
Wednesdays, Thursdays...
Just, I don't get out a lot. It's sad.

142
00:07:19,183 --> 00:07:20,534
What do you do with them?

143
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:22,585
You know, talk,

144
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:25,433
play Scrabble. I know a lot more words
than them, so I usually win.

145
00:07:25,505 --> 00:07:27,069
Makes me feel good about myself.

146
00:07:27,495 --> 00:07:30,145
It's a long story.
I'm just gonna... Tonight? Dinner?

147
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:31,341
Yeah.

148
00:07:32,592 --> 00:07:34,539
- Hello. Hey, Mr. Matthews.
- Yeah.

149
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:36,655
Hey.

150
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:39,041
I think he has a crush on you.

151
00:07:39,116 --> 00:07:41,600
God, no. No, no, no.
We're colleagues.

152
00:07:41,636 --> 00:07:43,218
- I would never go out...
- Good.

153
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:46,052
This school's hard enough as it is
without my sister banging the teacher.

154
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,921
Right.

155
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:52,872
So, I was wondering if maybe
I could spend the night tonight.

156
00:07:53,637 --> 00:07:56,018
We could, you know,
we could hang out, get some pizza.

157
00:07:56,422 --> 00:07:57,395
Invite Brenda.

158
00:07:57,665 --> 00:08:00,163
You know, I,
can't do it tonight, sweetie.

159
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,904
But tomorrow night for sure.

160
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:03,496
- Yeah. Sure.
- Sure.

161
00:08:10,618 --> 00:08:11,898
- Hey.
- Hey.

162
00:08:12,295 --> 00:08:14,246
So, any big plans tonight?

163
00:08:15,073 --> 00:08:16,188
Yeah.
Big date.

164
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:18,097
You and Ty...

165
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:21,072
No. Me and my family
we are doing family night.

166
00:08:21,577 --> 00:08:22,465
Family night?

167
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:24,968
Yeah.

168
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:27,350
They feel like they never see us, so...

169
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,840
Well, you know,
it's probably nottotalsocial suicide,

170
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,918
as long as you go someplace where
no one from this school will see you.

171
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:35,058
Lucky Strike Bowling Alley?

172
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:39,293
Yeah, maybe someone from
the chess club might still talk to you.

173
00:08:39,407 --> 00:08:40,407
Terrific!

174
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,790
- Hey, Ethan, what's up, man?
- Hey, man.

175
00:08:44,244 --> 00:08:46,832
So, I got your text.
Sorry you can't make it.

176
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:47,844
Yeah.

177
00:08:49,283 --> 00:08:52,145
I got to go, so I'll,
catch you guys later.

178
00:08:52,353 --> 00:08:53,068
Bye.

179
00:08:53,882 --> 00:08:56,698
So you're blowing me
off tonight for bowling?

180
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:59,272
God, my parents are making me.

181
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:01,195
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

182
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:03,557
I really wanted you to see the pier.

183
00:09:04,606 --> 00:09:06,514
Well,
we could...

184
00:09:08,326 --> 00:09:10,208
- What? What?
- Nothing.

185
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,342
What?

186
00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:14,583
I mean, instead of picking
me up at home,

187
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:18,726
if you just happened to,
on your way to the pier, you know,

188
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:21,448
maybe drop by the Lucky Strike lanes,

189
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,379
lanes, and maybe I could get out early?

190
00:09:24,491 --> 00:09:26,456
I mean, how long could they bowl?

191
00:09:27,026 --> 00:09:29,381
So I'll accidentally see you at 8:00.

192
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:32,550
- Okay. Great.
- All right.

193
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:38,789
Dude it's simple, just tell your parents
that you don't want to go.

194
00:09:38,922 --> 00:09:41,209
Look, I'm not trying
to hurt their feelings, man.

195
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:43,610
Just-just come to the bowling alley,

196
00:09:43,742 --> 00:09:46,895
tell them the thing about the movie.
There's no way they won't let me go.

197
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:48,279
You sure it'll work?

198
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:53,161
You know what? Bring a lot of people.
It'll be harder for them to say no.

199
00:09:53,256 --> 00:09:54,690
Peer pressure.
Got it.

200
00:09:57,308 --> 00:10:00,810
It's the weekend, miss.
You can go. Go home, go home.

201
00:10:00,982 --> 00:10:02,177
You're still here.

202
00:10:02,941 --> 00:10:04,453
I stayed for a math lab.

203
00:10:05,194 --> 00:10:07,873
- You have an "A" in that class.
- I have an "A."

204
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:10,953
I have an "A."

205
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:13,107
Geek.

206
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:16,313
So, what you doing tonight?

207
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:18,519
- You asking me out?
- I can't.

208
00:10:20,378 --> 00:10:23,458
You know, because we're
doing this thing, family night.

209
00:10:24,135 --> 00:10:24,976
Bowling.

210
00:10:25,912 --> 00:10:27,292
That sounds very PG.

211
00:10:28,247 --> 00:10:30,672
Yeah, you know, we used to do it
all the time in Wichita,

212
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,165
you know, every Friday night.

213
00:10:32,646 --> 00:10:33,912
We're weird, I know.

214
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:36,550
Actually,
I think it sounds kind of nice.

215
00:10:38,358 --> 00:10:39,473
You want to come?

216
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,190
We'll be at Lucky Strike.

217
00:10:44,213 --> 00:10:45,064
Maybe.

218
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:46,714
All right.

219
00:10:52,263 --> 00:10:54,703
- Hey, why are you still here?
- I'm waiting for my dad.

220
00:10:54,823 --> 00:10:58,053
- We're going straight to the airport.
- I am so jealous!

221
00:10:58,728 --> 00:11:00,000
Of course you are.

222
00:11:00,257 --> 00:11:03,540
Well, have the best time ever
and call me right when you get back.

223
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:08,311
Hey!
Hey, Mr. Clark.

224
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:12,292
- You got a new car!
- Princess.

225
00:11:13,093 --> 00:11:15,439
I'm so psyched. The first thing
I want to do when we get there.

226
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,160
Wait, which car are we taking?

227
00:11:17,653 --> 00:11:19,287
You know what, sweetie?
I am so sorry,

228
00:11:19,307 --> 00:11:21,734
but my merge is in jeopardy.
The whole deal's about to go south,

229
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:23,721
so I'm not gonna be able to take you,
not tonight.

230
00:11:23,752 --> 00:11:25,967
I'm gonna be stuck in the
office trying to fix this mess.

231
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:27,499
- But, Dad, we always.
- Listen,

232
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,604
I know how much this meant to you, so
I got you a little consolation present

233
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:33,488
to make it up to you, just like
the one I just bought for your mom.

234
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:36,994
I love it. Although,
Charles, I do think you spoil her.

235
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:39,829
Listen, don't do anything till I get to
the office. You want to drive, drop me?

236
00:11:39,858 --> 00:11:41,857
You are gonna look
so great next to that car.

237
00:11:43,481 --> 00:11:46,692
Listen, I'm gonna be in the office in
ten minutes. Could you just tell Pete...

238
00:12:07,783 --> 00:12:10,063
That is a skimpy little
skirt there for bowling.

239
00:12:10,183 --> 00:12:11,794
You got a hot date I don't know about?

240
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:13,456
Can't I just look good for Mom and Dad?

241
00:12:13,576 --> 00:12:15,483
- Annie! Dixon!
- Hey!

242
00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:19,134
- you lookhot.
- Thank you.

243
00:12:19,332 --> 00:12:21,088
Hey, Mr. And Mrs. Wilson.
Hey, Silver.

244
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,438
Hey, where were you today?
I was looking for you at school.

245
00:12:23,558 --> 00:12:26,515
Fell asleep behind the biology lab. I
saw Dixon, he said you were coming.

246
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,525
Mr. Jackson gave us so
much homework this weekend.

247
00:12:30,645 --> 00:12:32,745
You guys are cool
if Silver hangs with us?

248
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:35,152
- Yeah. Cool.
- Absolutely.

249
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,367
You invited Silver?

250
00:12:37,487 --> 00:12:38,305
And Navid.

251
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,914
It's family night.
Mom and Dad are gonna be pissed.

252
00:12:41,034 --> 00:12:43,550
Which is great because
I invited Ty along, too.

253
00:12:45,054 --> 00:12:46,915
- It just happened.
- Yeah, sure.

254
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:49,373
So, Ms. Silver,
do you know how to bowl or,

255
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:51,635
you know, are you
too cool for that kind of thing?

256
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:53,206
I'm gonna kick your ass.

257
00:12:53,822 --> 00:12:55,351
All right, so first to break 100.

258
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:58,319
- Buys fries?
- You're on. Don't do that. Here you go.

259
00:13:09,566 --> 00:13:13,272
And, again, I'm sorry I was late.
Traffic was a nightmare.

260
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,967
You know, this guy wouldn't move.
I think I hit a squirrel.

261
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:19,788
Did you get stuck in that?
No, I live just down the street.

262
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:21,516
- I walked here.
- That's right.

263
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,975
We could've just met at your house.
I mean I'd love to check out your place.

264
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,740
You know,
I could meet your son and... and...

265
00:13:29,144 --> 00:13:31,896
You're not ready for me to meet your
son. That's why you wanted to meet here.

266
00:13:31,922 --> 00:13:33,972
No, no, it's not that.

267
00:13:35,172 --> 00:13:37,103
Okay, actually, it kind of is.

268
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:38,654
But,

269
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:42,864
seriously, though, doesn't
it freak you out that I have a child?

270
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:45,660
Doesn't it freak you
out at all that I am a child?

271
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,704
A little. No, it's... look...

272
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,408
Look, I get it, you know, whenever
you're ready, I'd love to meet him.

273
00:13:52,884 --> 00:13:55,602
The truth is Sammy's
only met the one guy

274
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:58,052
that I've dated seriously
since he was born.

275
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,800
And that would be...?

276
00:14:00,127 --> 00:14:01,375
I'm just curious.

277
00:14:01,705 --> 00:14:02,768
His father.

278
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,904
We had a lot of history in high school.

279
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:09,911
Didn't see each other for a while,
and then...

280
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:14,247
hooked up one night
four years ago, and...

281
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:17,786
Sammy's dad ever see him?

282
00:14:18,226 --> 00:14:20,018
He did, in the beginning.

283
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:23,423
Then we had some issues.

284
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:26,901
Now he says he wants
to get back into Sammy's life.

285
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,261
And yours?

286
00:14:30,624 --> 00:14:32,049
Matthews for two?

287
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,276
- That's us.
- Great.

288
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,678
That's perfect.
Arm comes up straight.

289
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:47,162
My own dad is blocking me.

290
00:14:47,347 --> 00:14:48,899
Come on, Silver.

291
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:58,022
That one is a strike.
You got robbed!

292
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,233
- Good job.
- You got robbed.

293
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,056
Please tell me that this was a good idea

294
00:15:02,076 --> 00:15:04,663
because I think Silver
is the only one enjoying herself.

295
00:15:04,783 --> 00:15:06,315
This was a good idea.

296
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:12,090
That's just wrong.

297
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:15,264
- I'm going to get a soda.
- Yeah, me, too.

298
00:15:15,384 --> 00:15:16,822
I'm going to get us some fries.

299
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:18,273
Good going, Silver.

300
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,073
Yeah!

301
00:15:22,863 --> 00:15:24,925
- Nice!
- Okay, it'll get there.

302
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:27,555
It's gonna get there.
You're getting the hang of it.

303
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:31,638
Silver, I'm really glad you're here
because I think if you weren't,

304
00:15:31,788 --> 00:15:34,339
Dixon and Annie
would be even more miserable.

305
00:15:35,443 --> 00:15:38,355
I guess people around here
don't really do family night.

306
00:15:40,117 --> 00:15:42,806
No.
Not at all, actually, ever.

307
00:15:43,863 --> 00:15:46,531
But,
I think it's great what you're doing.

308
00:15:47,065 --> 00:15:48,349
Don't get me wrong...

309
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:50,472
I love this.

310
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,184
I wish my mom, you know, would come...

311
00:15:56,453 --> 00:15:58,382
I'm...
I guess I'm a little envious.

312
00:15:58,502 --> 00:15:59,541
Hey, Silver.

313
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,239
Silver, Navid's here.
Everybody's coming.

314
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,542
- Ty come?
- No.

315
00:16:10,524 --> 00:16:11,943
- All right, sweetie.
- Okay.

316
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,131
You need a strike.
Come on.

317
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,152
Show them how the old folks do it.

318
00:16:19,003 --> 00:16:20,464
See, we don't need them.

319
00:16:21,643 --> 00:16:23,691
- Okay! Next time.
- It was close.

320
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:26,313
- These are what I needed, French fries.
- I've seen better.

321
00:16:26,775 --> 00:16:29,075
- What up, y'all?
- Hey. Okay, we're all here.

322
00:16:29,195 --> 00:16:31,115
Talk to your parents and let's go.

323
00:16:31,393 --> 00:16:34,639
Wait. You know, we can't just leave.
My parents will know something's up.

324
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:37,651
All right, well,
I mean, I'm always up for some bowling.

325
00:16:37,771 --> 00:16:40,428
That is, of course, if Annie's
not too scared of getting beat.

326
00:16:41,894 --> 00:16:44,516
By you? Let's do it.
You're on.

327
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:48,324
- Excuse me, sir.
- Chicks versus dudes.

328
00:16:50,144 --> 00:16:52,081
You do not have your own bowling ball.

329
00:16:52,605 --> 00:16:53,322
What?

330
00:16:55,261 --> 00:16:57,306
What?
It was for my bar Mitzvah.

331
00:16:59,126 --> 00:17:00,817
Go, Silver.

332
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,044
Go, Silver.

333
00:17:11,592 --> 00:17:13,049
Really good try.

334
00:17:17,742 --> 00:17:19,351
I think I dropped it!

335
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,980
Strike!

336
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,670
All right, Annie!

337
00:17:44,168 --> 00:17:46,029
That's what I'm talking about!

338
00:17:47,162 --> 00:17:49,422
And that means we just crushed you guys.

339
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:50,280
What?

340
00:17:51,089 --> 00:17:51,990
Hey, yo.

341
00:17:52,164 --> 00:17:53,505
That was impressive.

342
00:17:56,138 --> 00:17:59,455
Do you want to,
I don't know, get some air or something?

343
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:01,581
Yeah.

344
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:03,299
- Yeah, sure.
- Awesome.

345
00:18:04,455 --> 00:18:06,774
Cool, yeah. Okay.
Yes.

346
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:23,242
<i>Head under water
When they tell me.</i>

347
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:27,715
<i>To breathe easy for a while
Breathing...</i>

348
00:18:27,835 --> 00:18:29,404
Baby, you sound pitchy.

349
00:18:29,584 --> 00:18:31,946
You sound bitchy.
What's up?

350
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,998
You can't be bumming about your dad.

351
00:18:34,227 --> 00:18:36,342
This is one hell of
a present for bailing on...

352
00:18:36,462 --> 00:18:38,934
Okay, he didn't bail.
He has to work tonight.

353
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:42,549
It's Morgan. She says a lot of people
are going to Lucky Strike.

354
00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:44,298
- Do you want to go?
- Yeah, whatever.

355
00:18:44,338 --> 00:18:46,116
We need to stop by
my dad's office first.

356
00:18:46,236 --> 00:18:46,929
What?

357
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:49,965
Well, I want to take him something
to eat. You know, take care of him.

358
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:52,914
I want to tell him,
you know, I love the car.

359
00:18:53,656 --> 00:18:54,673
I do, too.

360
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,774
I'm feeling Nobu.

361
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:00,675
Yeah.
That's a good choice.

362
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:10,964
Yep, I'll bet your parents
never make you do family night.

363
00:19:11,473 --> 00:19:15,375
No, not my family.
My parents are divorced.

364
00:19:16,134 --> 00:19:19,290
- They weren't when I met you.
- Yeah, it just happened last year.

365
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:23,043
God, I know so many people
whose parents are divorced,

366
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,583
but I think I would justfreak
if mine ever did.

367
00:19:25,793 --> 00:19:27,137
Yeah. I did.

368
00:19:27,606 --> 00:19:29,877
My dad's, like,
"No, it's great.

369
00:19:30,108 --> 00:19:33,938
Now you're gonna have two bedrooms, two
birthday parties." But now it's just,

370
00:19:34,058 --> 00:19:36,917
like, a competition between them
over who can throw the bigger one.

371
00:19:37,063 --> 00:19:39,178
Okay, I bet that doesn't totally suck.

372
00:19:40,857 --> 00:19:41,947
Well, you know...

373
00:19:42,317 --> 00:19:43,982
it actually kind of does.

374
00:19:47,348 --> 00:19:48,164
Anyway...

375
00:19:48,284 --> 00:19:51,274
I'm gonna save most of that emotional
goodness for my audition for The Hills.

376
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,080
So I don't want to
bore you with that, but...

377
00:19:54,196 --> 00:19:57,664
you know, I do think that
I could be the next spencer.

378
00:19:57,874 --> 00:19:59,064
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

379
00:19:59,122 --> 00:20:01,168
You wish, my friend.

380
00:20:01,203 --> 00:20:02,752
Yeah, yeah, I really do wish.

381
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:06,461
- Actually... You don't believe me?
- I don't know. I really don't know.

382
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:09,668
- I can spence anybody. Spence anybody.
- I can out-spence anybody.

383
00:20:10,462 --> 00:20:11,179
Annie.

384
00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:12,461
Ty!

385
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,582
You should go. You have a date, right?

386
00:20:19,762 --> 00:20:20,652
Right...

387
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,093
I'll see you inside.

388
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:37,431
Okay, I will be just a minute.

389
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:40,130
I'm gonna bring this
food into dad's office and...

390
00:20:46,263 --> 00:20:47,766
that's not your mom.

391
00:21:08,984 --> 00:21:12,105
I can'T... I can't belive
don't thinkthat's a big deal.

392
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:16,201
You were at chris brown's birthday.
He's such an amazing performer.

393
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:18,897
Yeah, he was a cool guy,
you know.

394
00:21:19,327 --> 00:21:22,161
You know, it's just
'cause my family's business.

395
00:21:22,219 --> 00:21:24,080
I get to meet a lot of people like that.

396
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,906
I know it sounds weird, but

397
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:29,059
you kind of get sick of that

398
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:31,827
whole scene after a while.

399
00:21:32,935 --> 00:21:35,426
So we should get going.
The band goes on at 11:00.

400
00:21:36,048 --> 00:21:38,360
Yeah, yeah, my parents
should be totally cool.

401
00:21:38,395 --> 00:21:40,383
- I will be right back.
- Cool.

402
00:21:42,663 --> 00:21:44,316
Come on, Harry.

403
00:21:45,832 --> 00:21:47,820
Yes!
Yes!

404
00:21:53,037 --> 00:21:54,375
You guys taking off?

405
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:58,157
Yeah.
I mean, if...

406
00:21:58,421 --> 00:21:59,554
if that's okay?

407
00:22:00,615 --> 00:22:02,389
Yeah. Just be home by curfew.

408
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:06,571
And you...
let me know how the bond film is.

409
00:22:07,228 --> 00:22:08,251
- Really?
- Yeah.

410
00:22:08,367 --> 00:22:10,054
That's what you guys wanted, right?

411
00:22:11,328 --> 00:22:12,126
Yeah.

412
00:22:14,379 --> 00:22:15,882
- Thanks.
- Thanks, dad.

413
00:22:16,213 --> 00:22:17,531
All right, bye, guys.

414
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:18,897
Bye. Have fun.

415
00:22:19,149 --> 00:22:20,513
It's just you and me.

416
00:22:36,794 --> 00:22:38,204
Naomi, say something.

417
00:22:39,245 --> 00:22:40,794
You're freaking me out.

418
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,745
Okay, I'm going to go get Ethan.

419
00:22:55,071 --> 00:22:56,944
We were...
we were just heading out.

420
00:22:56,982 --> 00:22:58,834
Cool. Yeah, I was going
to go bowl some more.

421
00:22:58,853 --> 00:23:01,797
Ethan, you got to help. Naomi's
freaking out in the parking lot.

422
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,578
What's wrong?

423
00:23:03,755 --> 00:23:06,211
She saw her father with another woman.
It's crazy.

424
00:23:09,476 --> 00:23:10,874
I have to go with Ethan.

425
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:17,600
Naomi.

426
00:23:19,968 --> 00:23:21,045
What's wrong?

427
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,741
Come here.
Come here.

428
00:23:32,725 --> 00:23:34,974
I saw my dad kissing another woman.

429
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:41,161
I just... I can't believe it,
you know. I can't.

430
00:23:42,093 --> 00:23:43,473
It's okay.
I'm sorry.

431
00:23:50,872 --> 00:23:52,970
It's okay.
It's okay.

432
00:23:54,557 --> 00:23:56,542
- I'm going to take you home, okay?
- Okay.

433
00:23:56,623 --> 00:23:58,797
I'll take care of you, okay?

434
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:01,688
- Come on.
- Okay.

435
00:24:20,888 --> 00:24:23,574
Yeah, way too much drama.
So you still up for the movie?

436
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,604
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah?

437
00:24:25,717 --> 00:24:26,775
Come on. Let's go.

438
00:24:27,516 --> 00:24:28,461
See you later.

439
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:39,415
Naomi and Ethan...
they're...

440
00:24:40,473 --> 00:24:41,721
addicted to each other.

441
00:24:49,312 --> 00:24:50,039
What?

442
00:24:50,818 --> 00:24:55,285
"Annie. Had to bolt to catch set.
Sorry. Call you. Ty."

443
00:24:56,525 --> 00:24:57,280
Great.

444
00:24:59,182 --> 00:25:01,535
So, you want to catch a bond movie?

445
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,550
Yeah. Guys, wait up.
Navid. Dixon.

446
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:08,273
Well...

447
00:25:08,756 --> 00:25:10,155
so much for a family night.

448
00:25:10,488 --> 00:25:12,755
Yes.
See, I'm just curious.

449
00:25:12,806 --> 00:25:15,486
Do you think that they really didn't
know that we knew they invited

450
00:25:15,606 --> 00:25:17,530
all their friends to go bowling?

451
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:20,969
Well, they should be with their friends.

452
00:25:21,413 --> 00:25:24,985
And we should be happy that they
have so many new friends to be with.

453
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,915
Yeah, so why do you look so sad,
madam?

454
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,169
I just...

455
00:25:30,752 --> 00:25:33,114
thought that they'd
still want to be with us.

456
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:34,297
You know, sometimes.

457
00:25:34,531 --> 00:25:36,475
I thought that we were
cooler than our parents.

458
00:25:36,526 --> 00:25:39,398
No, what...? Come... we, we...
are cool.

459
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,070
Yeah, we're cool.

460
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,512
Well, maybe we're hanging on to
family night for all the wrong reasons.

461
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:47,876
I mean, this is about them or us.

462
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:52,381
Are we about to have that

463
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,046
"I want to have another baby"
conversation?

464
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,227
No.

465
00:25:59,996 --> 00:26:01,791
But I may ask you for a puppy.

466
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:04,869
What level?

467
00:26:05,554 --> 00:26:09,674
Well, I'm a beginner, but he's
on medium, and now he wants a lets Paul.

468
00:26:10,094 --> 00:26:11,285
The man has good taste.

469
00:26:11,606 --> 00:26:13,609
I blew most
of my inheritance on a lets Paul.

470
00:26:14,611 --> 00:26:16,595
Spent the rest paying
off school Loans, but...

471
00:26:17,186 --> 00:26:18,320
- really?
- Yeah.

472
00:26:18,396 --> 00:26:19,794
Yeah, my grandfather.

473
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:22,536
He gave me just about
enough to cover the essentials.

474
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:26,522
He was this really
eccentric guy,

475
00:26:26,578 --> 00:26:28,738
you know. He gave most of his
money to charity, and...

476
00:26:31,248 --> 00:26:33,705
I don't know, truth be told,
even if he did give me all that money,

477
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,708
I probably would have
done the same thing.

478
00:26:36,612 --> 00:26:38,917
I've seen what that kind
of money does to people, and...

479
00:26:43,451 --> 00:26:44,717
I had a good time tonight.

480
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,426
Yeah, me, too.
Me, too.

481
00:26:47,882 --> 00:26:50,887
And you know, some day,
I look forward to meeting Sammy,

482
00:26:51,007 --> 00:26:53,350
you know, when you think we've
been dating long enough and...

483
00:26:53,622 --> 00:26:55,418
not-not that we're dating...

484
00:26:56,025 --> 00:26:57,007
No, but...

485
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,181
Gosh, i wasn't assuming...

486
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:01,036
that-that we were,

487
00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:02,200
Yeah.

488
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:03,889
Dating.

489
00:27:07,656 --> 00:27:10,038
So, what are we doing?

490
00:27:12,003 --> 00:27:13,251
We're colleagues.

491
00:27:14,721 --> 00:27:16,082
Hanging out.

492
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:20,244
I'm just going to do this.

493
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:29,850
Now are we dating?

494
00:27:31,357 --> 00:27:32,888
What the hell.

495
00:27:38,162 --> 00:27:40,432
- It was a pretty cool movie.
- Hey, there they are.

496
00:27:40,552 --> 00:27:41,597
How was the movie?

497
00:27:42,682 --> 00:27:45,423
It was good, you know,
like any bond movie.

498
00:27:45,773 --> 00:27:47,450
You know, one that's not out yet.

499
00:27:48,402 --> 00:27:50,500
I thought you had a date with Ty.

500
00:27:51,277 --> 00:27:52,581
Yeah. Long story.

501
00:27:52,897 --> 00:27:56,733
Well, it's getting kind of late, and
you still have some chores to do.

502
00:27:57,237 --> 00:27:58,447
Trash,
dishes...

503
00:27:58,531 --> 00:27:59,760
- Right.
- Fine.

504
00:28:00,842 --> 00:28:01,985
Yeah, and it's...

505
00:28:02,092 --> 00:28:04,511
You know, it's actually past
my curfew, so I'm going to go.

506
00:28:04,865 --> 00:28:06,963
Thank you so much
for joining us, Silver.

507
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:09,892
Hey, do you want me to call your mom,
let her know you're on your way home?

508
00:28:10,062 --> 00:28:12,244
No, actually,
I already called her, so it's fine.

509
00:28:12,263 --> 00:28:14,162
And thank you so much
for letting me hang.

510
00:28:14,282 --> 00:28:15,303
Shut up.

511
00:28:15,364 --> 00:28:16,780
- It was a pleasure.
- Anytime.

512
00:28:16,948 --> 00:28:18,578
- Bye. Later, baby.
- See you later.

513
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:20,139
Keep working on that bowling.

514
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,284
Come on.

515
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,774
Let's go work on those...

516
00:28:59,716 --> 00:29:00,722
Silver?

517
00:29:14,217 --> 00:29:15,408
What's going on?

518
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:19,849
I've been staying at the women's
shelter for a few weeks now.

519
00:29:23,989 --> 00:29:26,426
I did some community service
there this past summer,

520
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,852
and there's this woman who...

521
00:29:30,026 --> 00:29:31,795
she lets me stay there sometimes.

522
00:29:32,214 --> 00:29:34,029
Sort of knows my situation.

523
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:37,804
And my mom,
she drinks.

524
00:29:39,615 --> 00:29:41,072
When she's like this...

525
00:29:44,147 --> 00:29:46,020
she's a completely different person.

526
00:29:47,947 --> 00:29:48,965
It's like...

527
00:29:50,937 --> 00:29:52,081
she screams.

528
00:29:53,544 --> 00:29:55,372
She, she throws things.

529
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,418
She blames me.

530
00:30:03,304 --> 00:30:04,263
Sometimes...

531
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,538
she gets so out of control...

532
00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:12,831
I don't know she control,

533
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,558
sometimes it scares me.

534
00:30:21,744 --> 00:30:22,657
Come here.

535
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:01,874
I gotta talk to my dad.

536
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,072
What?

537
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:05,724
No.

538
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,802
Dixon, I didn'T... I didn't
tell you so you would tell your dad.

539
00:31:09,848 --> 00:31:10,795
Just listen.

540
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,680
No, I'm already enough
of a freak at school.

541
00:31:12,681 --> 00:31:14,984
I don't want all the other kids
to know my mom's a drunk, too.

542
00:31:14,996 --> 00:31:16,777
- Listen...
- No, thank you very much.

543
00:31:16,812 --> 00:31:17,748
No, look...

544
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:20,420
you don't think I know
what you're going through?

545
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:23,497
I didn't grow up in the cosby family.

546
00:31:24,055 --> 00:31:26,714
You think every other family
I lived with was like this?

547
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,160
No!

548
00:31:29,535 --> 00:31:32,830
I know what it's like to be around
someone who's wasted out of their mind!

549
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,279
I know what that stuff does to people.

550
00:31:41,784 --> 00:31:43,495
That's why I never do it myself.

551
00:31:59,027 --> 00:32:00,091
Silver, look...

552
00:32:03,846 --> 00:32:05,245
you got to trust my dad.

553
00:32:11,733 --> 00:32:13,016
Or at least trust me.

554
00:32:20,828 --> 00:32:22,712
Silver, can I get you something else?

555
00:32:23,087 --> 00:32:23,700
No.

556
00:32:23,954 --> 00:32:26,809
Okay, well, Silver,
you will stay here tonight,

557
00:32:26,924 --> 00:32:29,710
and as far as we're concerned,
until we get this figured out.

558
00:32:29,756 --> 00:32:32,244
- Yeah, she can stay in my room.
- She can stay in my room.

559
00:32:35,139 --> 00:32:36,447
Just trying to help.

560
00:32:37,251 --> 00:32:39,543
Well, it's late. I think
we should all get some sleep.

561
00:32:39,755 --> 00:32:40,888
Yeah.
Come on.

562
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:44,567
- Good night.
- Good night, my love.

563
00:32:44,591 --> 00:32:46,090
- Night, dad.
- I love you.

564
00:32:46,148 --> 00:32:47,963
- Good night, honey.
- Night, silver.

565
00:32:57,446 --> 00:32:59,145
Your sister's still asleep.

566
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:01,076
They went to bed late.

567
00:33:02,386 --> 00:33:04,560
Thanks, Harry,
for taking her in last night.

568
00:33:06,197 --> 00:33:08,521
If I had known what was going on,
if she had come to me...

569
00:33:08,544 --> 00:33:11,231
She's a kid. She thinks
that you hate your mother.

570
00:33:12,108 --> 00:33:13,495
No, I don't hate her.

571
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,298
It's just...
complicated.

572
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,164
Well, if there's anything that I can do,

573
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:22,199
you know,
if you want me to talk to your mom...

574
00:33:23,372 --> 00:33:24,737
I think it's time I did.

575
00:33:27,087 --> 00:33:30,463
Sweetie, if you want breakfast,
we're gonna have to order out.

576
00:33:30,631 --> 00:33:32,459
Penelope is sick for a change.

577
00:33:32,482 --> 00:33:34,031
- Mom.
- Yeah?

578
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,734
I went to dad's office last night.

579
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:41,978
And I saw him there
kissing another woman.

580
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:44,603
He was
all over her.

581
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,112
I'm so sorry, mom.

582
00:33:47,727 --> 00:33:49,114
Her name is Gail.

583
00:33:51,506 --> 00:33:52,801
I know all about her.

584
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,701
He's been seeing her for two years?

585
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:07,783
Honey, she doesn't live in town,
so they don't see each other very often.

586
00:34:08,164 --> 00:34:10,671
What's, what's going on?
Are you ending it?

587
00:34:10,694 --> 00:34:12,532
- Are you getting a divorce?
- No.

588
00:34:12,749 --> 00:34:14,656
I don't want to break up this family.

589
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,348
Mom, this isn't a family!

590
00:34:16,724 --> 00:34:17,441
Honey,

591
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:20,367
dad and I have a long history together,

592
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,703
okay?
We have two kids, two homes, friends.

593
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,432
We have a life together.

594
00:34:30,864 --> 00:34:31,789
Mom...

595
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:35,492
what kind of life is this?

596
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:37,698
Sweetheart...

597
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,623
it's one that I don't want to lose.

598
00:34:50,351 --> 00:34:54,848
You can imagine my surprise when you
called to say you were coming after...

599
00:34:55,592 --> 00:34:58,008
well, how long has it been
since our last altercation?

600
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:00,788
I came to talk about silver, mom.

601
00:35:01,402 --> 00:35:03,550
Well, erin is not here right now.

602
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:06,288
She is staying at a friend's house,
Naomi's,

603
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,910
I think, or...

604
00:35:07,944 --> 00:35:09,921
Are you kidding me?
Is that what you think?

605
00:35:10,832 --> 00:35:12,809
She hasn't been staying
at a friend's house.

606
00:35:12,848 --> 00:35:14,733
She has been sleeping at a shelter.

607
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:17,855
Well, she told me...

608
00:35:20,053 --> 00:35:22,851
How dare you give me that look.
I didn't know.

609
00:35:22,949 --> 00:35:25,100
Why is that?
Were you too drunk to notice?

610
00:35:25,287 --> 00:35:28,003
What is it these days, mom,
alcohol or are you back on coke?

611
00:35:28,212 --> 00:35:30,409
Let's go to another
meeting together again.

612
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,845
Let's hold hands and give
it up to our higher power.

613
00:35:32,868 --> 00:35:35,093
Do you realize what
you are doing to Silver?

614
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,475
Kelly?

615
00:35:37,585 --> 00:35:39,735
Hey, I thought I told
you to stay at the Wilsons'.

616
00:35:39,781 --> 00:35:42,139
- Hey, mom.
- Where the hell have you been staying?

617
00:35:42,264 --> 00:35:44,022
You see all the trouble you've caused?

618
00:35:44,197 --> 00:35:46,534
I don't believe this, Kelly.
I can handle this, all right?

619
00:35:46,568 --> 00:35:48,080
No, you can'T.
Neither could I.

620
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,725
I'm not gonna stand by and
watch you do to her what you did to me.

621
00:35:50,805 --> 00:35:53,590
- Because your life was so awful.
- I hate this!

622
00:35:54,103 --> 00:35:56,364
- Would you guys...
- Your sister is just leaving Erin.

623
00:35:56,365 --> 00:35:57,994
Yes, I am. And I am taking her with me.

624
00:35:58,034 --> 00:36:00,610
You have a four-year-old with
nobody to help you unless

625
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,628
by some miracle,

626
00:36:02,732 --> 00:36:06,131
he has decided to come back
and act like a dad.

627
00:36:06,305 --> 00:36:08,467
And now you want to
add a teenager on top of it?

628
00:36:08,971 --> 00:36:10,994
Let me tell you,
she is no walk in the park.

629
00:36:11,344 --> 00:36:12,962
She's coming to live with me. Let's go.

630
00:36:12,985 --> 00:36:14,777
You, lied to me,
and now you're gonna leave?

631
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,962
- Mom!
- Stop it, both of you!

632
00:36:18,704 --> 00:36:20,640
Mom, I can't take this anymore.

633
00:36:20,672 --> 00:36:22,510
- I can't just watch you...
- Get out!

634
00:36:25,661 --> 00:36:27,522
I am tired of both of you.

635
00:36:35,508 --> 00:36:36,676
Good job, mom.

636
00:36:58,486 --> 00:36:59,538
What's up

637
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,109
Hey, guys.

638
00:37:40,232 --> 00:37:41,760
What is all this?

639
00:37:41,931 --> 00:37:44,712
- We made breakfast.
- And I want everybody to sit.

640
00:37:46,552 --> 00:37:48,633
Everybody's sitting. Okay.

641
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:50,970
All sitting.
We're having a family breakfast.

642
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:52,471
- Smells great.
- Watch out.

643
00:37:52,518 --> 00:37:55,151
- The syrup is heated.
- My goodness, like a professional.

644
00:37:55,286 --> 00:37:57,644
- Took this very seriously.
- Smells great.

645
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,866
You know what we were thinking we could
maybe do for the next family night?

646
00:38:00,929 --> 00:38:04,015
Maybe we could go see a band
at, The House of Blues.

647
00:38:04,127 --> 00:38:05,358
That sounds great.

648
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:08,529
- Or the troubadour.
- Or, the one I like.

649
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:10,275
- Hollywood bowl.
- The hollywood bowl!

650
00:38:10,294 --> 00:38:11,642
Yes, the hollywood bowl!

651
00:38:11,688 --> 00:38:13,872
- Everybody talking about it at school.
- Take a picnic?

652
00:38:13,907 --> 00:38:16,733
We can bring a picnic basket! You can
do a picnic there 'cause it's outside.

653
00:38:16,814 --> 00:38:18,803
- It is outside.
- Oh, my god.
