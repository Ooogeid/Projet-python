1
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:07,752
- How long have you had a thing for Silver?
- Drop it, Dixon.

2
00:00:10,682 --> 00:00:12,030
You're getting married,

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,221
and you've never had sex with anyone,
including your pregnant fiancée?

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,470
We can't keep this baby.

5
00:00:18,895 --> 00:00:19,994
Thank you.

6
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:21,394
Good-bye, Maisie.

7
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:27,318
What is this?

8
00:00:27,807 --> 00:00:30,904
- It's my wrap.
- You slept with Liam in my bed?!

9
00:00:31,122 --> 00:00:33,073
- I didn't do anything.
- Get out!

10
00:00:33,287 --> 00:00:36,550
I was calling, I was concerned
about some underage drinking.

11
00:00:36,782 --> 00:00:38,495
She is your sister.
She's gonna hate you.

12
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:40,247
She'll never know it's me.

13
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:42,443
- Get out of bed. Get dressed.
- What the hell?

14
00:00:42,669 --> 00:00:44,450
Your stepfather's fed up!
It's over!

15
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:24,871
<i>Pencils down, everybody.</i>

16
00:01:25,327 --> 00:01:27,012
Blue books back to me, everybody.

17
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:28,043
See ya!

18
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:31,911
Summer school's over.

19
00:01:33,348 --> 00:01:34,891
Summer school's over!

20
00:01:35,636 --> 00:01:38,090
Summer school's over?!
Oh, my God!

21
00:01:42,108 --> 00:01:43,640
Adios, summer school!

22
00:01:44,175 --> 00:01:46,270
Suck it, summer school!

23
00:01:49,687 --> 00:01:51,103
- What's up?
- How are you?

24
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:53,050
- I'm fine.
- I'm good.

25
00:01:56,138 --> 00:01:57,032
So, the...

26
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,983
end-of-summer party's
still good for you?

27
00:02:01,166 --> 00:02:02,821
Sure.
We'll talk then.

28
00:02:03,568 --> 00:02:06,112
What's this?
You two talking? Are we back together?

29
00:02:06,286 --> 00:02:07,580
What did I miss?

30
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:11,560
You just interrupted an ordinary
moment by making it extremely awkward.

31
00:02:13,906 --> 00:02:14,932
See ya.

32
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:17,922
Never you mind, darling.
Let's hit the beach!

33
00:02:19,688 --> 00:02:21,322
- Congratulations!
- We're free!

34
00:02:21,497 --> 00:02:23,842
<i>A whole week without school!</i>

35
00:02:24,065 --> 00:02:25,172
Shotgun!

36
00:02:31,445 --> 00:02:34,503
We're on summer vacation, suckers!

37
00:03:12,156 --> 00:03:13,681
Thank you, Doug.

38
00:03:14,545 --> 00:03:15,340
Girls.

39
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,713
- Hi, Julian!
- Hey, Naomi, ladies.

40
00:03:26,928 --> 00:03:30,451
- Why are you giggling like that?
- Jason is so witty.

41
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:33,050
Wait. Jason, the guy
you met at Barney's?

42
00:03:33,426 --> 00:03:35,012
The guy who's twice your age?

43
00:03:35,188 --> 00:03:37,921
You should've heard her in class today.
She's obsessed.

44
00:03:40,148 --> 00:03:41,210
This is good.

45
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,222
I am finally going out
with a real man.

46
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:46,021
- He's so...
- Old?

47
00:03:46,196 --> 00:03:49,360
Brilliant. He reads
books, you guys, for fun.

48
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:51,180
Like <i>Lolita.</i>

49
00:03:52,685 --> 00:03:55,082
I'm telling you,
the minute I met him,

50
00:03:55,655 --> 00:03:57,963
- a thrill went up my spine.
- Excuse me.

51
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:02,661
There's a delivery here for one
of your guests. "Adrianna Tate Duncan"?

52
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,150
That's me.

53
00:04:04,517 --> 00:04:05,781
Thanks, Julian.

54
00:04:07,118 --> 00:04:10,322
- Another script.
- <i>Monica Lewinsky: A Movie Musical?</i>

55
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:13,433
- She's so annoying.
- Who, Monica Lewinsky?

56
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:16,332
Am I the only one who thought
she had real talent as a bag designer?

57
00:04:16,638 --> 00:04:17,433
Yes.

58
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:24,760
Haven't you told your mom
you don't want to act anymore?

59
00:04:24,936 --> 00:04:27,921
I think she thinks that
I'm gonna cave in, but I'm not.

60
00:04:28,345 --> 00:04:31,393
I am done. I don't care if she
kicks me out of the house.

61
00:04:32,558 --> 00:04:34,900
I'm done with drama
on camera and off:

62
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:39,390
taking drugs,
going to rehab, getting pregnant,

63
00:04:39,567 --> 00:04:40,980
deciding to give the baby up.

64
00:04:44,695 --> 00:04:46,861
It really took it out of me.

65
00:04:49,027 --> 00:04:51,082
You want to be "No Drama Adrianna."

66
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:53,561
Exactly. No drama.

67
00:04:53,735 --> 00:04:57,430
- I just want to be a normal teenager.
- Hell to the yes, I hear ya.

68
00:04:57,908 --> 00:04:59,331
To being teenagers.

69
00:05:01,525 --> 00:05:03,591
Madison, Henley, out of the pool!

70
00:05:07,035 --> 00:05:09,352
Either the club's having
a show of fashion don'ts

71
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:11,781
or summer school's out for the day.

72
00:05:13,797 --> 00:05:15,813
Actually,
summer school's out forever.

73
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:19,582
We have nothing to do but
just hang out here at the club.

74
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:23,011
I'm sure you're thrilled
to the gills about that.

75
00:05:23,996 --> 00:05:27,181
You know what? Would you guys
like to come to our end-of-summer bash?

76
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:28,662
I think I'm gonna pass.

77
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:32,861
If it were up to me, under-18's wouldn't
be allowed to spend time at the club

78
00:05:33,035 --> 00:05:34,453
without parental supervision.

79
00:05:34,996 --> 00:05:38,120
If it were up to me, over-50's wouldn't
be allowed to wear sleeveless shirts.

80
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:47,140
Diving time!

81
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:50,340
I'm ready.

82
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,621
<i>They look so cute!</i>

83
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,441
<i>Just look at this dress.</i>

84
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:11,560
Are you okay?

85
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:16,400
Yeah, I just...

86
00:06:17,018 --> 00:06:20,610
I guess I can't just snap my
fingers and become a normal teenager.

87
00:06:21,537 --> 00:06:22,833
But that's okay.

88
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:24,540
It's fine, because,

89
00:06:24,976 --> 00:06:26,820
I am making different choices:

90
00:06:26,996 --> 00:06:28,672
I am not taking drugs,

91
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:31,592
I am taking my time
in my relationship.

92
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:35,930
I'm waiting
for the right time to have sex.

93
00:06:36,445 --> 00:06:38,023
I'm sure Navid's loving that.

94
00:06:38,595 --> 00:06:41,013
He gets it.
He's really understanding.

95
00:06:41,406 --> 00:06:42,693
Understanding-slash-gay.

96
00:06:43,215 --> 00:06:45,310
He's is so not gay.

97
00:06:46,185 --> 00:06:48,363
He is very, very not gay!

98
00:06:49,865 --> 00:06:52,900
He knows I want to wait,
so he wants to wait, too.

99
00:06:54,406 --> 00:06:55,510
Dude...

100
00:06:56,505 --> 00:06:58,113
I'm so getting laid.

101
00:07:01,056 --> 00:07:03,490
Hold on. I thought
Adrianna wanted to wait.

102
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:04,923
We did.

103
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:08,830
We waited and waited,
and last night,

104
00:07:09,508 --> 00:07:12,652
she thanked me for being so patient.
And then she said

105
00:07:13,028 --> 00:07:15,880
she didn't want sex to eclipse
everything in our relationship.

106
00:07:16,058 --> 00:07:17,833
And I said, "It won't."

107
00:07:18,157 --> 00:07:19,521
And then she said,

108
00:07:20,636 --> 00:07:23,390
- "I know."
- Then she said she was ready, right?

109
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:26,101
She didn't have to. If she knows,
there's nothing to worry about

110
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:27,943
- and we're good to go.
- Got ya.

111
00:07:28,806 --> 00:07:31,362
But, yeah, I kinda need some help.

112
00:07:32,526 --> 00:07:35,000
Go buy the Kama Sutra.
I'm not showing you how it's done.

113
00:07:35,446 --> 00:07:37,310
Not the how, the where and the when.

114
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:39,693
I'm thinking,
of coming up with something special.

115
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:41,650
- You know what you need to do?
- What?

116
00:07:41,866 --> 00:07:43,950
Trick out a cabana
at your Beach Club.

117
00:07:45,505 --> 00:07:46,721
Keep talking.

118
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:48,263
I don't know...

119
00:07:48,695 --> 00:07:50,833
Fill it up with roses, candles,

120
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:53,803
- maybe buy some champagne.
- Non-alcoholic for Ade.

121
00:07:53,978 --> 00:07:57,320
Cool. Sure.
Maybe make a cool mix CD.

122
00:07:57,606 --> 00:07:58,643
Set the mood...

123
00:07:59,765 --> 00:08:01,413
Like a sex jams CD?

124
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,793
I like it.

125
00:08:05,888 --> 00:08:08,810
- What songs should I put on it?
- Obviously, "Sex Machine."

126
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,443
Obviously.

127
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:13,172
- Dude, I'm kidding.
- Me, too.

128
00:08:14,905 --> 00:08:18,402
Remember, sex is more romantic
for girls than it is guys.

129
00:08:18,796 --> 00:08:21,453
So think Feist, Norah Jones...

130
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,203
Dude, I don't want
to fall asleep, but...

131
00:08:24,376 --> 00:08:26,351
Believe me, you won't.

132
00:08:26,696 --> 00:08:28,960
It's gonna be a big night,
my friend. Let's do this.

133
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:31,361
- Here you go. Let's go!
- Enough girl talk.

134
00:08:32,988 --> 00:08:34,910
I'm so getting laid!

135
00:08:39,056 --> 00:08:40,521
This is all Ethan's fault.

136
00:08:40,697 --> 00:08:43,040
He scrambled me up about everything.

137
00:08:43,217 --> 00:08:44,642
Honestly, it's like

138
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,960
he got into my head
and I just short-circuited.

139
00:08:48,138 --> 00:08:49,612
I can't even tell what I want.

140
00:08:49,955 --> 00:08:52,481
But you're still talking
with Dixon tomorrow, right?

141
00:08:53,897 --> 00:08:56,911
- What are you going to say?
- I have absolutely no idea.

142
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,520
I keep going back and forth.

143
00:08:58,698 --> 00:09:00,800
Dixon. Ethan.
Ethan. Dixon.

144
00:09:00,972 --> 00:09:02,705
Children.
They are both children.

145
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:07,677
Seriously, I don't know why you're
so stuck on high school boys.

146
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,963
- High school boys know nothing about...
- Books?

147
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:15,423
For one thing.
How to pleasure a woman, for another.

148
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,671
Jason has these hands.

149
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:21,860
They're, like, man hands.

150
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:24,083
I'm telling you, I cannot wait

151
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:26,560
to have those hands
all over this corpus...

152
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:30,773
Those kinds of thoughts
you need to keep inside your head.

153
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:32,792
I'm just saying,

154
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:35,833
Liam's hands weren't nearly
as big and meaty as Jason's.

155
00:09:36,938 --> 00:09:37,952
Big and meaty?

156
00:09:38,187 --> 00:09:41,310
What about Liam?
Where is he? What's he up to?

157
00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:43,992
I heard that he moved
back to Long Island.

158
00:09:44,506 --> 00:09:46,751
He's probably tormenting
some hairspray chick

159
00:09:47,065 --> 00:09:49,472
with French manicured
toenails as we speak. Vomit.

160
00:09:49,647 --> 00:09:52,061
- Thank God I got over that jerk.
- Amen.

161
00:09:52,306 --> 00:09:54,870
It's actually ridiculous
how long it took me to get over him.

162
00:09:55,047 --> 00:09:56,963
He screwed that little skank
in my bed.

163
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,831
- You think that would've done the trick.
- Wait. I have to point something out.

164
00:10:01,005 --> 00:10:03,400
You didn't actually find
Annie in bed with Liam.

165
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,103
You found her wrap.
That's circumstantial evidence.

166
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:09,933
She did it.
She slept with him in my bed,

167
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:12,661
and then she called the cops
on my party.

168
00:10:12,838 --> 00:10:15,900
- Three people heard her.
- I know that she called the cops.

169
00:10:16,076 --> 00:10:18,243
I'm not saying Annie's not a rat.

170
00:10:18,457 --> 00:10:20,873
She's a rat, but come on.
A skank? I don't know.

171
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,511
I know.
She did it.

172
00:10:23,326 --> 00:10:25,340
And she needs to be punished.

173
00:10:32,838 --> 00:10:33,792
What?

174
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:38,243
I wondered if you wanted to go for
a walk. Check out the new neighborhood.

175
00:10:38,415 --> 00:10:39,921
Get a little sun.

176
00:10:40,498 --> 00:10:41,473
I don't.

177
00:10:44,985 --> 00:10:46,420
What's wrong?

178
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:50,780
Other than the fact that you,
for some reason, will not leave my room?

179
00:11:04,557 --> 00:11:09,550
UNIDENTIFIED MAN FOUND CRITICALLY INJURED ON...
JOHN DOE COMATOSE AFTER HIT AND RUN
MYSTERY DRIVER STILL AT LARGE

180
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,571
Flip!

181
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:27,861
- Oh, my God!
- What?

182
00:11:28,318 --> 00:11:30,092
- He's here!
- Who?

183
00:11:30,265 --> 00:11:32,850
- Jason!
- Mr. Man Hands?

184
00:11:33,115 --> 00:11:35,350
I did not know
he belonged to the club.

185
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:37,811
You guys have to meet him.

186
00:11:38,805 --> 00:11:40,272
<i>Daddy's here!</i>

187
00:11:41,257 --> 00:11:42,762
<i>How are you?</i>

188
00:11:44,447 --> 00:11:46,180
<i>- Good day?
- Hi, honey.</i>

191
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,221
I'm glad that you're trying
to get over Mr. Man Hands,

192
00:12:14,395 --> 00:12:16,753
but do you really think
that exercise is the key?

193
00:12:16,927 --> 00:12:19,181
Who said anything about exercise?

194
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:22,090
I'll show you how
I'm going to get over Jason.

195
00:12:22,556 --> 00:12:24,241
Speak of the devil.

196
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:25,993
There he is.
Act natural.

197
00:12:28,936 --> 00:12:30,123
That's Tennis Guy.

198
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:33,201
Is he hot or is he hot?

199
00:12:35,926 --> 00:12:38,093
- Jason who, right?
- He's hot.

200
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:40,931
What's with the squint?

201
00:12:41,106 --> 00:12:43,781
- Just looking for a wedding ring.
- Come on.

202
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:54,482
Believe it or not, I haven't
actually played that much tennis.

203
00:12:54,658 --> 00:12:56,762
I'm sure I'll pick it
up pretty quick, though.

204
00:12:56,938 --> 00:13:00,462
I'm no expert, but I'm thinking we
should be on opposite sides of the net.

205
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,942
I'm just warming up my old serve.

206
00:13:05,168 --> 00:13:07,090
Remember, the
objective of the game is...

207
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:09,623
Hit the ball
into Tennis Guy's court.

208
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:28,311
Oh, my God.

209
00:13:30,465 --> 00:13:33,210
I am so, so sorry.

210
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,521
Pink, huh?

211
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:36,623
That way I can tell they're mine.

212
00:13:36,795 --> 00:13:39,020
I'm very possessive
when it comes to balls.

213
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:43,650
- You could always go by the numbers.
- I don't do anything by the numbers.

214
00:13:46,217 --> 00:13:48,451
I got to say, I like
the way you handle balls.

215
00:13:49,768 --> 00:13:52,161
The way you're saying
that, it almost sounds sexual.

216
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,931
It's meant to.

217
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,000
Do you go to school around here?

218
00:13:56,165 --> 00:13:58,811
- We go to West Beverly.
- Do we look like we're in high school?

219
00:13:58,937 --> 00:14:01,130
No kidding. I'm
starting there this semester.

220
00:14:01,496 --> 00:14:02,522
You are?

221
00:14:02,768 --> 00:14:05,023
I was going to Exeter
for the last couple years, but,

222
00:14:05,396 --> 00:14:08,693
I guess I just missed L.A.
The weather, the beach.

223
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:10,013
Mostly the girls.

224
00:14:11,025 --> 00:14:12,241
I'm Teddy.

225
00:14:13,307 --> 00:14:15,433
- Nice to meet you.
- This is Silver.

226
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:17,393
Silver with her Silver tongue.

227
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:19,861
Flirt with her. This whole
<i>Vicky Cristina Barcelona</i> thing

228
00:14:20,038 --> 00:14:22,313
- is not really my cup of tea.
- Sure thing, Vicky.

229
00:14:24,777 --> 00:14:28,292
She's... just very
serious about her tennis.

230
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:43,712
You two know each other.

231
00:14:44,906 --> 00:14:47,653
Guys, this is Teddy.
Teddy Montgomery.

232
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,670
My old boyfriend from summer camp.

233
00:14:51,948 --> 00:14:54,411
It's so nice to see you.

234
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:02,091
All right. The burgers
will be up in a minute.

235
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,900
Here you go, Harry.
Here's your beer.

236
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:05,060
All right.

237
00:15:06,718 --> 00:15:08,492
To new beginnings.

238
00:15:08,665 --> 00:15:10,072
New beginnings.

239
00:15:10,308 --> 00:15:11,962
Is that some kind of jab at me?

240
00:15:12,576 --> 00:15:14,482
Of course not.
We're just celebrating.

241
00:15:14,656 --> 00:15:17,220
Come on.
We got a new house.

242
00:15:17,397 --> 00:15:19,652
A new school year.
Grandma's got a show in Vegas.

243
00:15:19,828 --> 00:15:21,663
- Things are good.
- Whatever.

244
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:28,903
Are you going to this party
at the Beach Club?

245
00:15:29,138 --> 00:15:30,451
Yeah, right.

246
00:15:30,627 --> 00:15:33,142
You know what? I think
that you do need a new beginning.

247
00:15:33,316 --> 00:15:35,831
You decided to call
the cops on the party.

248
00:15:36,005 --> 00:15:38,013
Your friends are mad at you.
Deal with it.

249
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:46,363
I'm not hungry.

250
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:49,100
Honey, we're here as a family.
Don't go. This is nice.

251
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:50,560
Let her go.

252
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:53,570
Whatever this is, she's going
to have to deal with it.

I need to talk to you.

00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:30,583
All right.

259
00:16:53,668 --> 00:16:56,092
I'm still completely
mind-boggled by the fact

260
00:16:56,438 --> 00:16:59,331
that Tennis Guy Teddy
is Teddy Montgomery.

261
00:16:59,507 --> 00:17:01,300
Athletic, charming and oh, yes,

262
00:17:01,477 --> 00:17:03,873
his dad is one of the biggest
movie stars in the universe.

263
00:17:04,045 --> 00:17:06,683
But I can't date him because
he used to date my best friend.

264
00:17:06,856 --> 00:17:08,863
Honestly, that was like years ago.

265
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:10,923
He's all yours, trust me.

266
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,801
No way.
You were crazy about him.

267
00:17:12,977 --> 00:17:15,323
- What if you want him back?
- I have a boyfriend.

268
00:17:15,496 --> 00:17:16,622
It's okay.

269
00:17:16,795 --> 00:17:18,533
This place is loaded with man meat.

270
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,733
Just need to find myself
a nice, fresh side of beef.

271
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:26,052
How about an old,
maggoty, married side of beef?

1 New Text Message From: Ethan

273
00:17:55,447 --> 00:17:57,481
So, what is it?

274
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,231
What's going on?

275
00:18:03,486 --> 00:18:05,050
Something happened...

276
00:18:05,756 --> 00:18:07,202
On the night of prom.

277
00:18:10,908 --> 00:18:12,481
Something bad.

278
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:20,510
I did something really bad.

279
00:18:23,995 --> 00:18:27,053
I think maybe I know.

280
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,373
What do you mean?

281
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:33,863
You slept with Liam?

282
00:18:35,287 --> 00:18:36,382
What?

283
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:40,193
I know before you told
me that you didn't,

284
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:42,941
but you can tell me the truth.

285
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:44,992
I'm not going
to judge you or anything.

286
00:18:45,848 --> 00:18:47,410
I'm sorry.
What?!

287
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:49,603
You know what you got to do now.

288
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:51,672
You got to apologize to Naomi.

289
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:55,093
That's what you think?

290
00:18:55,895 --> 00:18:56,943
Yeah, I do.

291
00:18:57,695 --> 00:19:00,323
And I think you have a
problem with apologizing.

292
00:19:00,998 --> 00:19:02,050
What?

293
00:19:02,265 --> 00:19:05,440
Come on, I spent the whole
summer in summer school because of you.

294
00:19:05,695 --> 00:19:07,471
And you never apologized once?!

295
00:19:07,706 --> 00:19:10,473
- That's pretty messed up.
- Oh, my God!

296
00:19:11,346 --> 00:19:13,650
You can't do it, can you?

297
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:16,020
You can't say you're sorry.
Two words.

298
00:19:16,266 --> 00:19:17,981
"I'm sorry."

299
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:26,072
- You're incredible.
- Screw you!

300
00:19:32,618 --> 00:19:33,960
Screw you, too.

301
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,513
How you doing, Julian?
So good to see you.

302
00:19:47,756 --> 00:19:51,481
- How you been?
- Good. I just came here to,

303
00:19:52,328 --> 00:19:54,413
- rent a cabana.
- Absolutely.

304
00:19:54,588 --> 00:19:56,511
Just have your parents
come in and sign for it.

305
00:19:59,215 --> 00:20:01,553
- My parents, right.
- You got to be over 18.

306
00:20:01,725 --> 00:20:04,783
Gotcha. What was I thinking?
No problem, man.

307
00:20:06,056 --> 00:20:07,863
I'll send for them...

308
00:20:08,088 --> 00:20:10,120
That's a good rule.

309
00:20:13,976 --> 00:20:16,550
I am not going to this party.

310
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:19,760
- You can't leave me here.
- Watch me.

311
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:22,132
The world doesn't revolve
around you, Annie.

312
00:20:22,658 --> 00:20:24,650
I'm telling you,
I'm not talking to you.

313
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:26,472
Come on, Naomi, you are.

314
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:29,453
You see? You're talking.

315
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,101
You're married.

316
00:20:32,158 --> 00:20:33,501
Technically, yes.

317
00:20:34,228 --> 00:20:35,520
But not in here.

318
00:20:36,037 --> 00:20:38,382
You know, when we met at Barney's...

319
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:41,300
I've never felt like that before.

320
00:20:42,288 --> 00:20:43,233
Honestly.

321
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:46,450
It sent a thrill up my spine.

322
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,610
It did?

323
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,511
Are you kidding me?

324
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,551
You're a special girl,

325
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,583
and I think what we have
between us is special.

326
00:20:57,867 --> 00:21:00,800
I know it's a little inconvenient
that I'm married, but

327
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:04,253
I'm sure we can find some
way of working around it.

328
00:21:04,675 --> 00:21:06,592
Because I think we're
bigger than labels.

329
00:21:08,286 --> 00:21:09,081
And...

330
00:21:11,995 --> 00:21:13,542
I do know you, Naomi.

331
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:16,472
And you know me.

332
00:21:20,767 --> 00:21:22,512
Jason, hold that thought.

333
00:21:26,055 --> 00:21:27,711
What are you doing here, Annie?

334
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:29,831
I don't want to be here, believe me.

335
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,483
I will be gone soon, okay?

336
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:33,452
Don't turn your back on me.

337
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:37,483
I did not have sex with Liam, Naomi.

338
00:21:38,727 --> 00:21:41,130
Right. You didn't call the police
either, did you?

339
00:21:42,407 --> 00:21:43,702
Get out of here.

340
00:21:44,378 --> 00:21:46,342
And stay the hell away from me.

341
00:21:50,605 --> 00:21:52,650
Is everything okay, sweetheart?

342
00:21:53,827 --> 00:21:54,721
Come on.

343
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:56,973
You think you know me.

344
00:21:57,658 --> 00:21:59,041
You don't know me.

345
00:21:59,316 --> 00:22:02,561
I may be a lot of things, but
I will tell you what I'm not.

346
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:05,262
I am not a cheating skunk

347
00:22:18,427 --> 00:22:19,572
Are you okay?

348
00:22:20,247 --> 00:22:22,633
Julian, I think...
he needs some water.

349
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,151
I don't know what's wrong

350
00:22:28,436 --> 00:22:30,780
- Take a sip. It's okay.
- I'll get some help.

351
00:22:30,915 --> 00:22:32,861
Come on, you'll feel better.

352
00:22:36,097 --> 00:22:37,301
Thanks, man.

353
00:22:42,676 --> 00:22:44,751
All right, look, are we good?

354
00:22:44,877 --> 00:22:45,883
So good.

355
00:22:46,018 --> 00:22:47,350
All right, look,

356
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,130
It'll be even better later.

357
00:22:49,256 --> 00:22:51,113
- Just trust me.
- All right, I trust you.

358
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:52,883
You never forget
your first time, man.

359
00:22:53,017 --> 00:22:54,763
Let's go down in history.

360
00:22:59,885 --> 00:23:02,011
Teddy, this is my boyfriend Navid.

361
00:23:02,385 --> 00:23:03,951
Navid, this is Teddy.

362
00:23:04,075 --> 00:23:06,311
- Navid, good to meet you, man.
- Nice to meet you.

363
00:23:06,447 --> 00:23:09,421
We went to summer camp together.
I've known him since I was, what?

364
00:23:10,197 --> 00:23:10,992
Eight.

365
00:23:11,217 --> 00:23:12,793
Eight? That's crazy.

366
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:14,551
Right.

367
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:16,271
What's in the bag?

368
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,323
My mom... she was
here the other day,

369
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:23,153
and, she forgot some stuff,
so I'm gonna go

370
00:23:23,447 --> 00:23:24,942
stash it in the car.

371
00:23:25,526 --> 00:23:26,903
But I'll be right back.

372
00:23:27,307 --> 00:23:28,322
Nice to meet you.

373
00:23:28,495 --> 00:23:30,051
Nice meeting you too, man.

374
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:41,302
So...

375
00:23:42,175 --> 00:23:43,350
Cool party, huh?

376
00:23:45,907 --> 00:23:47,451
- It's cool.
- Cool.

377
00:23:49,055 --> 00:23:50,883
So you want to go...

378
00:24:02,945 --> 00:24:03,741
So...

379
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:07,271
Well...

380
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,172
I guess it's time to talk.

381
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,671
Do you want to be back together?

382
00:24:33,618 --> 00:24:36,973
Well, good, 'cause what
I was going to say was,

383
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:52,762
I missed you.

384
00:24:55,225 --> 00:24:56,623
I missed you, too.

385
00:25:04,915 --> 00:25:07,113
Look, Dixon, it's me.
I can't find you

386
00:25:07,248 --> 00:25:10,500
and I need to get out of here,
at least just give me the keys,

387
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:13,252
so I can just wait in
the car, okay? Please.

388
00:25:13,377 --> 00:25:14,870
Please call me back.

389
00:25:21,836 --> 00:25:22,780
I'm Mark.

390
00:25:23,318 --> 00:25:25,610
I know who you are.
You're a junior.

391
00:25:25,745 --> 00:25:26,912
Or a senior, now.

392
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:28,693
Wait a sec.
I know you.

393
00:25:29,506 --> 00:25:30,980
You're the principal's daughter.

394
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:34,143
You are the one that called the cops

395
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:35,572
on Naomi Clark's party.

396
00:25:36,086 --> 00:25:38,163
I really don't
feel like talking, okay?

397
00:25:41,175 --> 00:25:42,921
Well, how about drinking?

398
00:25:52,705 --> 00:25:54,061
Why not, right?

399
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:55,893
Why not?

400
00:26:36,098 --> 00:26:36,892
Vicky.

401
00:26:37,998 --> 00:26:39,653
It's Silver, actually.

402
00:26:39,775 --> 00:26:42,222
Is this your phone?
I found it down by the beach.

403
00:26:42,396 --> 00:26:44,210
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Unless...

404
00:26:44,335 --> 00:26:46,481
Maybe I got a text from
someone named Ethan,

405
00:26:46,608 --> 00:26:48,111
- saying...
- Stop.

406
00:26:48,245 --> 00:26:51,521
"I've decided to stay in Montana.
The worst part is leaving you.

407
00:26:51,698 --> 00:26:53,812
I'm still thinking about that kiss."

408
00:26:55,546 --> 00:26:56,983
It's not funny, Teddy.

409
00:27:15,376 --> 00:27:16,450
Do you want to...

410
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:20,613
- Stop, yeah. We should stop.
- Go somewhere more private, maybe?

411
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:22,202
What?

412
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:23,750
Or stop.

413
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:27,180
We can stop.
That's an option.

414
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:30,052
We've talked about this.

415
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:33,583
- About waiting.
- We have waited...

416
00:27:33,717 --> 00:27:36,211
And I thought we mastered
the whole waiting thing.

417
00:27:37,086 --> 00:27:39,380
I thought maybe we were ready to...

418
00:27:40,146 --> 00:27:41,093
Not wait.

419
00:27:43,077 --> 00:27:44,913
We love each other, and...

420
00:27:45,286 --> 00:27:46,931
I thought this would be

421
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:49,732
a physical manifestation of our

422
00:27:50,676 --> 00:27:52,713
multifaceted, emotional,

423
00:27:54,346 --> 00:27:55,671
intellectual love.

424
00:27:58,148 --> 00:28:00,351
Sex changes things, though.

425
00:28:01,028 --> 00:28:03,050
And change is good.
Change we can believe in.

426
00:28:03,177 --> 00:28:05,352
You're not...
This not sleeping together thing,

427
00:28:05,478 --> 00:28:07,551
this is already a big change for me.

428
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:09,850
I used to meet someone,
sleep with him

429
00:28:10,025 --> 00:28:12,512
immediately, and then it
was just sex, sex, sex.

430
00:28:13,127 --> 00:28:16,012
Sex everywhere.
Sex all the time. Sex...

431
00:28:16,407 --> 00:28:17,583
Sounds awful.

432
00:28:19,205 --> 00:28:21,271
After sex comes drama.

433
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:22,910
It's inevitable.

434
00:28:25,015 --> 00:28:27,153
This is really hard for me.

435
00:28:27,818 --> 00:28:31,261
But I do know that I don't
want my life filled with drama.

436
00:28:32,738 --> 00:28:34,412
I want to be normal.

437
00:28:36,617 --> 00:28:39,002
I want to be No Drama Adrianna.

438
00:28:42,045 --> 00:28:45,012
Fine. Then, I'll just be
No Sex Navid.

439
00:28:49,048 --> 00:28:50,142
Are you mad?

440
00:28:53,177 --> 00:28:54,111
At you?

441
00:28:55,537 --> 00:28:56,330
Never.

442
00:29:28,047 --> 00:29:29,610
How'd you score a cabana?

443
00:29:31,797 --> 00:29:34,471
Here. Go ahead.
Knock yourself out.

444
00:29:37,618 --> 00:29:38,513
Come on.

445
00:29:41,117 --> 00:29:42,012
Come on.

446
00:30:24,877 --> 00:30:27,293
- Dixon right?
- Yeah man, How's it going?

447
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:30,093
Good music. Pretty girls.
Can't complain.

448
00:30:30,535 --> 00:30:33,793
Yeah, I hear you.
You haven't seen Silver have you?

449
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,312
She's about... yea high.
Rihanna bob.

450
00:30:37,756 --> 00:30:39,751
She's, probably off
texting that dude.

451
00:30:40,287 --> 00:30:41,281
What dude?

452
00:30:42,187 --> 00:30:44,820
Some Ethan character's
messing with her head.

453
00:30:46,766 --> 00:30:47,762
About what?

454
00:30:48,295 --> 00:30:49,390
I don't know.

455
00:30:49,526 --> 00:30:51,912
They kissed. I don't know.
I have no idea.

456
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:56,493
She is a prickly one,
that Sil... ver.

457
00:30:58,025 --> 00:30:59,330
How's it going?

458
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,770
It's good, just, you know,
getting the lay of the land.

459
00:31:05,986 --> 00:31:07,673
Do you recognize this?

460
00:31:07,795 --> 00:31:08,791
Is this...

461
00:31:09,735 --> 00:31:10,732
Oh, God.

462
00:31:11,248 --> 00:31:15,033
We scored second place at the camp
talent show dancing to that song.

463
00:31:15,426 --> 00:31:16,432
Come on.

464
00:31:16,707 --> 00:31:19,091
- Let's do our thing.
- That was, like, four years ago.

465
00:31:19,228 --> 00:31:21,060
Follow my lead.

466
00:31:42,256 --> 00:31:43,772
Give me some of that.

467
00:31:45,975 --> 00:31:47,821
Geez. Look at him.
He's so friggin' hot.

468
00:31:47,946 --> 00:31:49,612
He'd be the answer
to all my problems.

469
00:31:49,736 --> 00:31:52,282
If only Ade hadn't banged
him, I'd be all over that.

470
00:31:52,628 --> 00:31:54,060
Excuse me?

471
00:31:54,188 --> 00:31:56,950
For real. I'd do him right here,
right now.

472
00:31:57,178 --> 00:31:58,792
Wait. Ade had sex with that guy?

473
00:31:59,327 --> 00:32:01,411
Oh, relax. Not recently.

474
00:32:01,585 --> 00:32:04,171
Way back when they used to date.
Doesn't help me much.

475
00:32:04,338 --> 00:32:06,540
I can't go there,
because he was her first.

476
00:32:10,266 --> 00:32:12,272
- You never forget your first.
- Exactly.

477
00:32:12,405 --> 00:32:14,023
What is this...?

478
00:32:28,877 --> 00:32:30,153
You and me, we're done.

479
00:32:30,686 --> 00:32:31,482
What?

480
00:32:32,607 --> 00:32:35,490
Why don't you text Ethan and
cry on his shoulder about it?

481
00:32:47,588 --> 00:32:49,212
- Want one?
- Yeah. Thanks.

482
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,703
Are you okay?

483
00:32:55,836 --> 00:32:57,802
Terrific.
Couldn't be better.

484
00:32:58,358 --> 00:32:59,801
Where is that girl?

485
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,063
Of all the lowdown, awful, dirty...

486
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,732
- Listen, whatever you think...
- Think? I don't think.

487
00:33:04,866 --> 00:33:07,110
I know, because I saw it
with my own eyes.

488
00:33:07,358 --> 00:33:08,730
What did you see?

489
00:33:08,857 --> 00:33:09,861
My cabaña.

490
00:33:10,805 --> 00:33:11,700
What?

491
00:33:11,838 --> 00:33:13,282
I came down to the club tonight

492
00:33:13,406 --> 00:33:15,702
to start decorating it
for my daughter's very special

493
00:33:15,837 --> 00:33:17,432
sixth birthday tomorrow,

494
00:33:18,107 --> 00:33:20,260
only to find that it has
been completely trashed,

495
00:33:20,386 --> 00:33:22,753
and I am sure one of you did it.

496
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:25,733
Someone trashed your...
Your "cabanya"?

497
00:33:26,498 --> 00:33:27,861
That's why you're upset? Geez.

498
00:33:27,988 --> 00:33:29,673
Which one of you did it, huh?

499
00:33:29,805 --> 00:33:32,211
Which one of you left behind this...

500
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,670
Sex jams CD?

501
00:33:39,357 --> 00:33:40,161
Fine.

502
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:43,292
I'll shut down the music,
and we'll all wait around

503
00:33:43,425 --> 00:33:45,063
until someone admits to it.

504
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:48,102
Oh, man, this...
This is embarrassing.

505
00:33:50,857 --> 00:33:51,842
I'm Teddy.

506
00:33:52,668 --> 00:33:54,222
Teddy Montgomery.

507
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:56,791
Oh, and this is yours?

508
00:33:57,737 --> 00:33:59,662
Well, actually, it's my father's.

509
00:34:00,185 --> 00:34:02,413
Maybe you've heard of him.
Spence Montgomery.

510
00:34:06,827 --> 00:34:08,371
Spence Montgomery.

511
00:34:08,987 --> 00:34:10,740
- Of course. As in...
- As in.

512
00:34:11,337 --> 00:34:13,702
He doesn't like to sign out
the cabanas at the front desk

513
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:16,180
because you never know
who's gonna tip off the paparazzi.

514
00:34:16,307 --> 00:34:18,013
- Of course.
- I'm sure you understand.

515
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:21,493
Anyway, he told me he made
a huge mess down here.

516
00:34:21,627 --> 00:34:24,603
I was supposed to take care of it,
but I got caught up.

517
00:34:24,775 --> 00:34:26,033
And I'm really sorry.

518
00:34:26,157 --> 00:34:27,981
I think I can let it go
just this once.

519
00:34:29,105 --> 00:34:30,031
Really?

520
00:34:31,908 --> 00:34:34,151
You just tell your dad
he owes Bitsy Epstein one.

521
00:34:34,328 --> 00:34:35,732
Oh, does he ever!

522
00:34:37,057 --> 00:34:39,292
Could I just get his CD back?

523
00:34:39,425 --> 00:34:40,422
Of course.

524
00:34:42,035 --> 00:34:43,033
Toodle-loo.

525
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:48,081
Thank you.

526
00:34:48,257 --> 00:34:49,670
That was incredible.

527
00:34:50,237 --> 00:34:51,630
Okay, two questions.

528
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:53,553
Whose was it? And...

529
00:34:54,305 --> 00:34:56,460
What the hell is a sex jams CD?

530
00:35:00,128 --> 00:35:01,172
Thanks a lot.

531
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:04,440
You just ruined my whole life.

532
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:24,663
I can't breathe.

533
00:35:25,185 --> 00:35:27,292
Sweetie, it's going to be okay.

534
00:35:27,858 --> 00:35:30,512
I'm sorry I didn't tell you guys
I was texting Ethan.

535
00:35:31,745 --> 00:35:32,941
I was just...

536
00:35:33,735 --> 00:35:34,960
So confused.

537
00:35:35,536 --> 00:35:37,210
So he's gonna stay in Montana?

538
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:42,381
And when I found out...

539
00:35:42,556 --> 00:35:43,972
The choice was easy?

540
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:46,661
Yeah, but...

541
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:49,112
Not like that.

542
00:35:50,977 --> 00:35:52,711
When I learned that

543
00:35:53,595 --> 00:35:55,922
Ethan was moving across the country,

544
00:35:57,845 --> 00:35:59,470
it suddenly became clear.

545
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:02,612
Because I wasn't disappointed.

546
00:36:05,526 --> 00:36:06,831
I was relieved.

547
00:36:10,177 --> 00:36:11,071
And then

548
00:36:12,718 --> 00:36:14,463
I imagined what if...

549
00:36:14,985 --> 00:36:16,993
Dixon moved across the country.

550
00:36:17,945 --> 00:36:19,260
And I thought,

551
00:36:20,985 --> 00:36:22,420
if I lost Dixon,

552
00:36:23,187 --> 00:36:25,111
I wouldn't be able to breathe.

553
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:28,701
And I can't breathe.

554
00:36:30,585 --> 00:36:32,262
I can't breathe.

555
00:36:36,976 --> 00:36:38,871
- Man, do it!
- Do it, bro!

556
00:36:40,936 --> 00:36:42,041
Oh, wipeout!

557
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:45,410
Get a car.
Where's Silver?

558
00:36:45,535 --> 00:36:47,213
I hope she's okay.

559
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,213
I know. I've never seen her so sad

560
00:36:49,335 --> 00:36:51,472
in, like, a non-bipolar state.

561
00:36:59,777 --> 00:37:00,972
How you doing?

562
00:37:01,676 --> 00:37:03,843
You know what?
I'm okay.

563
00:37:03,975 --> 00:37:06,521
Because I'm gonna get him back.

564
00:37:07,576 --> 00:37:10,342
Me and Dixon... we are not done.

565
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:13,300
I'm done.
I'm done.

566
00:37:13,776 --> 00:37:14,811
You sure?

567
00:37:15,098 --> 00:37:18,012
Am I sure?
She's been texting Ethan.

568
00:37:18,807 --> 00:37:20,971
I'm done.
I'm doner than done.

569
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:22,943
I'm overcooked.

570
00:37:23,078 --> 00:37:24,940
And Silver, she's dead to me, man.

571
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:26,942
I'm officially single.
Officially.

572
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,072
Officially... single.

573
00:37:31,157 --> 00:37:33,500
- Hey, ladies. How you doing?
- Come on.

574
00:37:35,376 --> 00:37:37,610
What do we think about
Tom from the water polo team?

575
00:37:37,736 --> 00:37:40,063
He's tall, handsome...
He doesn't drive the best car.

576
00:37:40,278 --> 00:37:43,411
You're right actually, cars matter.
What about Diego? You guys remember him?

577
00:37:43,538 --> 00:37:46,760
He was in my Spanish class last year.
I thought he was like a language genius.

578
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:49,113
- Turns out he actually was Spanish.
- I got to stop you.

579
00:37:49,246 --> 00:37:50,822
You have something
against Spaniards?

580
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:53,422
I have something against you going
from guy to guy to guy like this.

581
00:37:53,557 --> 00:37:55,052
- Seriously, slow down.
- I can't.

582
00:37:55,186 --> 00:37:56,482
- Why?
- It doesn't matter.

583
00:37:56,618 --> 00:37:58,111
It does. Why are you so desperate?

584
00:37:58,245 --> 00:37:59,263
Because...

585
00:38:02,577 --> 00:38:05,742
Because if I don't have
another guy to focus on...

586
00:38:08,107 --> 00:38:10,350
then all I can think of is Liam.

587
00:38:11,815 --> 00:38:13,301
I thought you were over him.

588
00:38:13,837 --> 00:38:15,000
Well, I'm not.

589
00:38:17,497 --> 00:38:20,311
I really wish I were, but I'm not.

590
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:22,971
Why didn't you tell us?

591
00:38:23,106 --> 00:38:24,642
'Cause I should be over him.

592
00:38:25,307 --> 00:38:26,543
Because he cheated on me

593
00:38:26,678 --> 00:38:28,720
and then moved to
another frickin' state.

594
00:38:28,896 --> 00:38:31,653
But if I don't have someone else
to distract me 24-7,

595
00:38:32,178 --> 00:38:33,912
then my mind just goes right
back to him,

596
00:38:34,035 --> 00:38:36,873
and all I can think about
is Liam, Liam, Liam, Liam, Liam.

597
00:38:57,697 --> 00:38:59,243
I got to talk to you.

598
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,341
What's up?

599
00:39:57,868 --> 00:39:58,681
Not much.

600
00:39:59,976 --> 00:40:02,371
All right, well,
I'll see you around.

601
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:08,911
No way.
Dude, I'm telling you.

602
00:40:09,036 --> 00:40:10,810
The principal's daughter? Bull.

603
00:40:11,665 --> 00:40:13,872
You know, I expected
such skepticism...

604
00:40:14,598 --> 00:40:17,343
which is why I was sure
to get proof.

605
00:40:17,747 --> 00:40:21,330
What is it they say, a picture
is worth a thousand words?

606
00:40:29,175 --> 00:40:31,663
I thought I told you to
stay the hell away from me.

607
00:40:32,027 --> 00:40:33,972
I bet Naomi'd like to see that.

608
00:40:34,357 --> 00:40:35,302
See what?

609
00:40:35,468 --> 00:40:37,893
- Nothing. It's just this...
- It's not nothing.

610
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:39,710
Oh, my God.

611
00:40:41,487 --> 00:40:43,172
Is that naked girl Annie?

612
00:40:47,905 --> 00:40:49,223
What are you doing?

613
00:40:49,978 --> 00:40:52,360
- What did you...?
- Thank you very much.

614
00:40:55,626 --> 00:40:56,843
There you are.

615
00:40:57,657 --> 00:40:58,773
Are you okay?

616
00:41:00,466 --> 00:41:01,612
Much better now.

617
00:41:02,238 --> 00:41:05,771
You know what, I have a feeling
this is going to be our year.
