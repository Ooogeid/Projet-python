1
00:00:07,134 --> 00:00:09,834
Absolutely. For real.
Where do you want to live?

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,767
I can't go to prom. I can't
deal with West Beverly kids yet.

3
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:15,301
I'm pregnant, and
it's your baby.

4
00:00:15,368 --> 00:00:16,734
Are you trying
to ruin my life, Ade?

5
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:18,800
You are a volcano.

6
00:00:18,867 --> 00:00:21,067
This whole good girl
routine-- it's just a mask.

7
00:00:21,134 --> 00:00:24,034
And when you finally can't take
it anymore, and you explode,

8
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:25,600
it's gonna be fantastic.

9
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:27,167
I would enjoy having dinner
with you.

10
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:29,267
How about tomorrow night?
Why the hell not?

11
00:00:29,334 --> 00:00:31,001
I don't want to be some
booty call. I'm not the type

12
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:32,700
<i>of girl you run into
at a Chinese restaurant</i>

13
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:34,167
<i>and take into a bathroom.</i>

14
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,667
Would you like to go
to the prom with me?

15
00:00:35,734 --> 00:00:37,201
Really?
Really.

16
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:38,800
We got the house.
Now the bank is saying

17
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:40,767
that it might take up
to a week to sort out.

18
00:00:40,834 --> 00:00:42,767
I so don't want you
to have to pay with your money.

19
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,101
But I don't mind.

20
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:45,667
You're so sweet.

21
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:51,867
(rock music playing)

22
00:00:51,934 --> 00:00:53,600
I thought the prom was fun,

23
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:56,567
but this after-prom party's
even better!

24
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:01,001
(music stops)

25
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:03,500
<i>HARRY:
This year, after-prom parties
will lead</i>

26
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:05,800
<i>to very serious consequences.</i>

27
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:09,867
All joking aside,

28
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:12,900
I have a real message here
for the sophomore class.

29
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:16,600
As you know, parties after
this year's junior prom led

30
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:18,967
to one student being arrested
for a DUI,

31
00:01:19,034 --> 00:01:22,401
several others being treated for
alcohol poisoning.

32
00:01:22,468 --> 00:01:24,600
Which is why the school board,
in conjunction

33
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,934
with the Beverly Hills
Police Department,

34
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:30,267
has come up with a new policy
on after-prom parties.

35
00:01:33,834 --> 00:01:37,867
If you are caught
at an after-prom party

36
00:01:37,934 --> 00:01:41,934
where alcohol is being served,
you will be suspended.

37
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,067
(people groaning)

38
00:01:43,134 --> 00:01:45,067
HARRY:
If you're suspended,

39
00:01:45,134 --> 00:01:47,034
you will have to go
to summer school.

40
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:51,067
So, you're saying that one party
can ruin my whole summer?

41
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:55,334
Yes, it can,
so think about the consequences.

42
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:59,567
Attend the school-sanctioned
post-prom party only.

43
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:03,633
Be smart and safe
on prom night.

44
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:06,167
Okay.

45
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:07,500
Okay, what were
you thinking?

46
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:09,334
Oh, my dad begged me,
guilted me,

47
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:12,234
and then promised to buy me
whatever prom dress I wanted.

48
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:14,067
Well, I certainly hope
you're getting Chanel.

49
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,301
Seriously. Not that
I have a prom date yet.

50
00:02:16,368 --> 00:02:17,267
Hey, Annie.

51
00:02:17,334 --> 00:02:18,301
(laughs)

52
00:02:18,368 --> 00:02:19,533
Hey.

53
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,368
So, how do you know
the dorkasaurus?

54
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:22,834
Charlie Pinkwater?
Mm-hmm.

55
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,600
Oh, he is very big
in the world of stage crew.

56
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,134
Mmm. Tasty.
Mm-hmm.

57
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:30,001
Hey, uh, maybe Charlie Pinkwater
could take you to the prom.

58
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,468
Shut up. No way!

59
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:33,533
Oh, right. He probably
saw the video.

60
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,500
Ugh. Am I ever
gonna live it down?

61
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:37,201
Of course you
will, honey.

62
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:39,401
<i>I mean, Mariah Carey
got over Glitter, right?</i>

63
00:02:39,468 --> 00:02:40,633
Not helping.

64
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,734
Thank you.

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Thank you.

66
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:51,734
What is this?

67
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:55,334
It's a California Horn Shark.

68
00:02:55,401 --> 00:02:56,834
See the spots?

69
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,201
The, uh, large
pectoral fins?

70
00:02:59,267 --> 00:03:00,667
Why didn't you take the test?

71
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:02,767
Well, it only counts
for 20% of your grade.

72
00:03:02,834 --> 00:03:04,034
I have an 85 average.

73
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,533
So, even with a zero,
I'll still have a 68,

74
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,734
which means I'll pass.

75
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,667
I don't get you, Liam.

76
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:11,767
I mean,
what are you trying to prove?

77
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:14,633
You're clearly a smart kid,
you got a lot of potential.

78
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,867
Why are you throwing it away?

79
00:03:16,934 --> 00:03:19,533
You know, it's too bad
I'm not from the inner city.

80
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,001
Then you could inspire me
to win the Academic Decathlon

81
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:23,368
with your tough but earnest

82
00:03:23,434 --> 00:03:26,368
coaching and wise platitudes
about life.

83
00:03:26,434 --> 00:03:29,533
(gasps) They could even make a
major motion picture out of it.

84
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,700
You can go.

85
00:03:34,934 --> 00:03:35,867
O, Captain! My Captain!

86
00:03:35,934 --> 00:03:37,167
Very nice.

87
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:40,600
What's up, man?
Hey.

88
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,434
Mr. Matthews,
you wanted to see me?

89
00:03:42,533 --> 00:03:44,734
Yeah. I have great news.

90
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:53,533
Can you follow me to
the living room, please?

91
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,301
The couch
goes in here.

92
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,900
Facing the fireplace
or facing the windows?

93
00:03:57,967 --> 00:03:59,034
The window.
Fireplace.

94
00:03:59,101 --> 00:04:00,267
The window.

95
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:02,101
You want to always
prioritize the view.

96
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:03,667
You have much to
learn, Grasshopper.

97
00:04:03,734 --> 00:04:05,134
I mean, I still
can't believe

98
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:06,468
you wanted
to buy a white leather couch.

99
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:09,334
(laughs)
God, you are so L.A.

100
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:11,034
Hey, can I ask
your advice?
Yeah.

101
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:12,900
No white leather
pants, either.

102
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:15,167
Okay, so I'm sort of, whatever,
seeing this guy Liam.

103
00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:17,934
He likes me. I'm not sure
if he knows he likes me,

104
00:04:18,001 --> 00:04:19,334
but I know he likes me.

105
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:21,767
He just has a really, really
bad case of relationship phobia.

106
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:24,101
But I want him to go
to the prom with me.

107
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:27,867
Ah. Well, if you want to get
a man to do what you want,

108
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,900
<i>you pull a Lysistrata.</i>

109
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:32,001
What's that,
like an inner thigh muscle?

110
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,767
(laughs)
The play?

111
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:35,867
By Aristophanes?

112
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:38,067
Where women withhold sex
to get what they want.

113
00:04:38,134 --> 00:04:40,368
What if what they want is sex?

114
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:41,767
(laughs)
Oh.

115
00:04:41,834 --> 00:04:44,001
You have a lot to learn,
Grasshopper.

116
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:45,500
Oh, don't touch that!

117
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:47,468
Uh, don't
touch that.

118
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,034
Okay, so, do you want to be
good cop this time or bad cop?

119
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:57,500
I was the bad cop
with David Harris last week.

120
00:04:57,567 --> 00:04:58,767
That was your bad cop?

121
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:00,234
I thought
you were being the good cop.

122
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:03,201
What? No. That was the bad cop
with a heart of gold.

123
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:05,567
Oh, is that what that was?
(knocking at door)

124
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:07,600
Okay, I am gonna
be bad cop.

125
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:10,034
Yes. Yes.

126
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,967
Wow. Both of you.

127
00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:14,401
I had no idea
I could expect a threesome.

128
00:05:14,468 --> 00:05:17,334
Sit down, Liam.

129
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:19,533
(sighs)

130
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,834
Is this about Matthews?

131
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,201
Because I'm telling you,

132
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:25,001
that man does not
appreciate art.

133
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:27,167
I will cut
to the chase.

134
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:29,101
Your father called us yesterday.

135
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:30,301
Oh, wow.

136
00:05:30,368 --> 00:05:33,101
Oh, I haven't talked to him
in... ten years.

137
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,267
What'd he say?

138
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,900
Where's he been?

139
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:37,834
Oh.

140
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,667
Were you referring
to my stepdad?

141
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:41,934
Right. Your stepfather.

142
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:43,600
He's concerned
about you, Liam.

143
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:44,767
(scoffs)

144
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:46,900
He thinks that you are detached,
antisocial.

145
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:48,500
Not committed to this school.

146
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:50,633
"Committed"being
the operative word.

147
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,767
This isn't a joke, Liam.

148
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:53,967
He requested your records.

149
00:05:54,034 --> 00:05:55,734
He's looking
at military schools.

150
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,867
God, you don't want to go
to a military school.

151
00:05:57,934 --> 00:05:59,434
You know what?
Maybe he does.

152
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,633
I have brochures.

153
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,201
No, Kel,
he doesn't need those.

154
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:03,967
Look, there's not much time

155
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:05,867
left before the end
of the year, hmm?

156
00:06:05,934 --> 00:06:07,067
You make a little effort,

157
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,201
study hard for your finals,
bring up your grades...

158
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:11,301
Oh. Here we go.

159
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:12,468
Show willingness
to get involved

160
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:14,167
with the community
here at West Beverly.

161
00:06:14,234 --> 00:06:16,700
How? Join the pep squad?

162
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:18,533
Student Council?
The Wildcat Crooners?

163
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,401
Frankly, any of those things
could help at this point.

164
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:24,001
He just needs to see
that you're making an effort.

165
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:26,067
Plenty of options.

166
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,533
So, how tan do you want to go?

167
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,800
I'm not sure.

168
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:37,267
I've never done this before.

169
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:40,067
My friends just said

170
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:41,267
Oh, it's for prom?s tanning

171
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,934
Why didn't you just say so?

172
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:46,734
All right, we'll go
with Weekend in Barbados.

173
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,301
As long as it's not too dark.

174
00:06:48,368 --> 00:06:49,967
I don't want to look silly
or anything.

175
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,234
Oh, you won't look silly.

176
00:06:51,301 --> 00:06:52,800
You'll look awesome.

177
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:55,301
Oh, God, I love proms.

178
00:06:55,368 --> 00:06:57,001
Are you psyched?

179
00:06:57,067 --> 00:07:00,700
Yeah. I'm just not
the most experienced prom-goer.

180
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:02,600
Turn around, bum to me.

181
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:07,368
Well, you came
to the right person.

182
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:09,368
All right,
here's what you need to do.

183
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:12,301
You need to get your hair
blown out, your eyebrows done.

184
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:14,067
You have to get acrylic nails.

185
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,633
Nails? Really?

186
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,401
Well, yeah. You don't want
to stand out, do you?

187
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:20,368
No. Definitely not.

188
00:07:20,434 --> 00:07:21,633
Okay, good.

189
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,034
Now, let's see.

190
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:24,468
The day of...

191
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:26,468
This is very important.

192
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,800
Shave everywhere.

193
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:32,001
Okay.

194
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:36,067
(phone ringing)

195
00:07:37,468 --> 00:07:39,468
Oh.

196
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:43,434
Hello?

197
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,700
What's up?

198
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:45,967
Oh, not much.

199
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:47,734
Just reading a classic
Greek play.

200
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,134
So, listen, do you want to go
to the prom with me?

201
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:55,834
Um...

202
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,533
yeah, sure.

203
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,134
Cool.

204
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:02,234
So, look, I'll talk to you
tomorrow, all right?

205
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:04,301
Yeah. Sounds good.

206
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:11,734
(screaming)

207
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,101
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

208
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:17,834
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh,
my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

209
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,800

<font color="#ffff00">Thx to YYeTs.net for transcripts</font>

210
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:40,433
Take your seats.

211
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,867
Seats, everybody!

212
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:45,467
Put your tucheses
in your chairs

213
00:08:45,534 --> 00:08:48,367
if you know
what's good for your health.

214
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:50,901
(Annie sighs)

215
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:54,067
Tick, tock. Tick, tock.

216
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,700
What is that
supposed to mean?

217
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:57,667
Nothing. Just wondering
how long it's gonna take

218
00:08:57,734 --> 00:08:59,667
for you
to drop the nice girl act.

219
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:02,801
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe it's not an act?

220
00:09:02,867 --> 00:09:04,634
Maybe I'm just a nice person?

221
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,201
Not really.

222
00:09:06,268 --> 00:09:07,534
(scoffs)
Tick, tock.

223
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,067
Tick, tock.

224
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:13,834
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
could you all pick a partner?

225
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:15,300
(whispers):
Oh. You and me?

226
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:17,067
CHARLIE:
Hey, Annie?

227
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:18,700
Do you have a partner?

228
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:19,901
Nope.

229
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:24,268
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
the first part of CPR...

230
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:27,634
Hey, so, I happened to
hear through the grapevine

231
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,901
that you might
be prom eligible.

232
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:31,234
What?

233
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,067
All of which is a
long introduction

234
00:09:33,134 --> 00:09:36,201
to a-a question
I'd like to pose.

235
00:09:36,268 --> 00:09:37,901
(clears throat)

236
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:40,101
That, uh, question being:

237
00:09:40,168 --> 00:09:42,767
uh, would you
possibly want to go

238
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:45,500
to the sophomore
prom, uh, with me?

239
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:50,001
...which brings us
to the ABCs of CPR.

240
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:51,700
Yes.

241
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:54,767
Sure, Charlie. I would love
to go to prom with you.

242
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:56,500
I would be thrilled.

243
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:58,101
(laughs)
Thrilled.

244
00:09:58,168 --> 00:10:01,400
IRVING:
You're gonna tap for the
response, and then...

245
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:12,367
Uh, hey, come on.

246
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:13,867
Pretty sharp, huh?
No.

247
00:10:13,934 --> 00:10:15,201
Girls-- I'm telling you,

248
00:10:15,268 --> 00:10:17,001
are not into
that flashy stuff.

249
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:19,034
They just want it
simple, classy,

250
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:21,034
like James Bond.

251
00:10:21,101 --> 00:10:22,201
All right, fine.

252
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:24,034
Would James Bond use a cane?

253
00:10:24,101 --> 00:10:25,467
No! He would not.

254
00:10:25,534 --> 00:10:26,867
No. Hey,

255
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:28,201
so, uh, I got picked

256
00:10:28,268 --> 00:10:30,034
for the All-American Lacrosse
Camp this summer.

257
00:10:30,101 --> 00:10:31,767
Shut up!

258
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:33,767
That's-- you know what?

259
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,433
I'm so impressed, I-I can't
even be jealous.

260
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,934
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

261
00:10:38,001 --> 00:10:39,034
Cool?

262
00:10:39,101 --> 00:10:40,201
You're set, man.

263
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:42,367
There's scouts all
over that camp.

264
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,400
They see you, you get recruited,

265
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:47,567
you get a scholarship
to any college you want.

266
00:10:47,634 --> 00:10:51,168
Damn, bro, your whole life,
it-it just got figured out.

267
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,101
I guess.
I mean, I was just

268
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:54,867
planning on
going to Montana this summer.

269
00:10:54,934 --> 00:10:56,700
You know, visit my dad.
Take a road trip.

270
00:10:56,767 --> 00:10:59,700
But now it's going to be nothing
but wind sprints

271
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:00,967
and shooting drills for me.

272
00:11:01,034 --> 00:11:02,467
Sounds pretty amazing
to me.

273
00:11:02,534 --> 00:11:04,034
SILVER:
What sounds amazing?

274
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:05,867
Hi.
Hey.

275
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:08,534
Mr. Ethan, here,
just got tapped

276
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,534
<i>for the All-American
Lacrosse Camp.</i>

277
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,801
What?!

278
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:14,067
That is amazing!

279
00:11:14,134 --> 00:11:16,433
I forget sometimes
you're like King Jock.

280
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,234
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

281
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,834
Uh, anyway, I'm going
to head out.

282
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:21,834
Well, how goes the online
tux shopping?

283
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:24,034
You guys got accessories
and whatever picked out?

284
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:25,201
Oh, well, I'm
not going.

285
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,734
But I think we got
Dixon all squared away.

286
00:11:26,801 --> 00:11:28,101
What do you mean
you're not going?

287
00:11:28,168 --> 00:11:30,034
Uh, I don't have a date.

288
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:32,034
Well, you should
just go with us!

289
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:33,234
I mean, you don't
need a date.

290
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,667
We're all basically
going as a group.

291
00:11:34,734 --> 00:11:35,867
DIXON:
Yeah. We've got

292
00:11:35,934 --> 00:11:37,534
a pretty sick ride.
Come on.

293
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,534
I could really use
the moral support.

294
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,333
Please.

295
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,567
Yeah.

296
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:43,600
Yeah, sure.

297
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,433
Uh, see you
guys later.

298
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,934
All right, man.
Hey, yo.

299
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:48,767
I'm, uh, I'm going to get you
this top hat, all right?

300
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,534
Uh, no, please do not.

301
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,534
What is this?

302
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,801
He-he asked for it.

303
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:54,467
He said--
You are not--

304
00:11:54,534 --> 00:11:56,400
You are not going...
He said I should go
for that T-Pain look.

305
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:57,400
Uh-uh.

306
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,433
All right, only you.

307
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,534
Only you can
pull it off.

308
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,168
DIXON:
I-I could pull it off.
I think I can.

309
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:05,801
We are going to Navid's, Dad.

310
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:08,101
His parents are going to be
there. It's not a party.

311
00:12:08,168 --> 00:12:10,101
I am not asking you
to be a tattletale.

312
00:12:10,168 --> 00:12:12,901
I am just saying that if there
is an illegal non-school

313
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:14,400
sponsored after-party,
I think

314
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,934
that you should tell me
about it.

315
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,400
Harry.
What?

316
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,634
Come on, sweetheart, this is

317
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,300
a Beverly Hills party
we are talking about.

318
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:21,534
I grew up here.

319
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,567
I went to these parties

320
00:12:22,634 --> 00:12:24,600
and there were drugs,

321
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:26,168
sex, booze.

322
00:12:27,234 --> 00:12:29,134
What'd I miss?
ANNIE:
Oh!

323
00:12:29,135 --> 00:12:31,735
Just dad telling me an
intoxicating story

324
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:33,901
about his degenerate peers.

325
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:35,667
And I do mean
intoxicating.

326
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:36,668
Honey, is Silver staying for dinner?

327
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:39,234
Oh, um, no, no.

328
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,567
It's-it's-- I know,

329
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,600
she had a lot of homework
and stuff.

330
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:43,834
Did you find a tux?

331
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:45,600
Yeah. You know,
it's oretty boring though.

332
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,400
But it's cool.

333
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,400
All I care about is Silver
having a good time.

334
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:50,600
If she has a
good time,

335
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:53,300
she sees West Beverly isn't
such a bad place,

336
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:55,667
I bet she'll come back
to school next year!

337
00:12:57,134 --> 00:12:57,794
Yeah, well,

338
00:12:58,101 --> 00:12:59,333
I hope it works out.
I just don't

339
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,867
want you to get your hopes up.

340
00:13:02,168 --> 00:13:03,333
I appreciate it, Mom.

341
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,967
But don't worry about me.
I got this.

342
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,268
I got this.

343
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,101
So, Dixon,

344
00:13:08,168 --> 00:13:10,634
where were you saying that
after-prom party was again?

345
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:12,834
(laughing)

346
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:14,433
(laughing)

347
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,333
Okay, this...

348
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,934
is so... pretty.

349
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,367
Eh, too sweet for me.

350
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:24,101
I'll try it.

351
00:13:25,134 --> 00:13:26,834
Thanks.

352
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:29,867
I don't imagine that you have
any maternity prom dresses?

353
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:30,901
Well, of course.

354
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:32,168
Come here.

355
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:33,901
You know what you
should do?
What?

356
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:35,901
Call Jaws like the last
possible moment,

357
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:37,234
tell him you're sick,

358
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,467
then you can find another date.

359
00:13:38,534 --> 00:13:39,634
He'll never know.

360
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,201
I am not saying that I'm sick.

361
00:13:41,268 --> 00:13:42,201
(sighs)

362
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:43,234
Becky.

363
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,234
I can't decide.

364
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,034
These all look
so good on me.

365
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:48,467
I'm going to get
all of these,

366
00:13:48,534 --> 00:13:50,467
then ask Jen's
advice later.

367
00:13:50,534 --> 00:13:52,034
No problem.

368
00:13:52,101 --> 00:13:54,101
Oh, credit card.

369
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,467
Okay, ladies.

370
00:13:57,534 --> 00:13:58,801
What do you think?

371
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:00,367
(Annie sighs)

372
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:02,367
It's so pretty.

373
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:03,867
But not you.

374
00:14:03,934 --> 00:14:05,901
I'm really just going
for Dixon.

375
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:08,400
I don't want to stand out.

376
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:10,433
(exhaling)

377
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,767
Okay, I'm going to go
try on my dress.

378
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:14,400
Oh, shoes.
ANNIE:
Oh!

379
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:17,168
NAOMI:
You know what
we could do?

380
00:14:17,234 --> 00:14:19,101
Hmm?
Run over your legs
with my car.

381
00:14:19,168 --> 00:14:21,101
Ugh, enough. Okay?

382
00:14:21,168 --> 00:14:24,333
I'm not exactly crazy about
your prom date either, FYI.

383
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,600
(clears throat)

384
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:27,600
You know what, Annie?
You need to get on board.

385
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:30,201
Liam is clearly over
his commitment issues.

386
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:32,567
Why else would he have
invited me to come with him?

387
00:14:32,634 --> 00:14:33,901
You're right.

388
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:35,034
I'm sorry.

389
00:14:35,101 --> 00:14:37,067
I'm just glad that
you're happy.

390
00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:39,268
I am.

391
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,268
Hey, Naomi,

392
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,634
had a bit of a problem.

393
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,700
Your card was
declined.

394
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,168
NAOMI:
Jen?

395
00:14:53,234 --> 00:14:55,500
Don't track mud
on the rugs.

396
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:57,534
Jen, I need to ask you
something.

397
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,367
Oh, wait! First,

398
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:01,433
let me show you my...

399
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:04,667
...prom dress!

400
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:06,333
Your what?

401
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,333
Ryan Matthews asked me
to be his date.

402
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,001
I thought I'd go as a lark.

403
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:11,134
Anyway, how hilarious is it

404
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,201
to wear couture
to the sophomore prom?

405
00:15:13,268 --> 00:15:14,700
Yeah, pretty hilarious.

406
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:17,234
Listen, Jen, my Amex was
declined today.

407
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,201
I called our business
manager,

408
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:21,034
she said I reached my limit.

409
00:15:21,101 --> 00:15:23,067
I didn't know the card
even had a limit.

410
00:15:23,134 --> 00:15:26,067
Oh, my God, how mortifying.

411
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,700
Um, I didn't know I was
paying for everything.

412
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:33,734
I mean, the-the furniture,

413
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:35,467
the paintings,
the couture.

414
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,001
It all went on my card,
didn't it?

415
00:15:40,034 --> 00:15:42,700
I'm sorry.

416
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:44,901
I don't get it,
I-I thought you worked out

417
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:46,400
the whole wiring money business.

418
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:47,433
What's going on?

419
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,268
(sighs)

420
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,134
Oh, God. Um...

421
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:55,168
the truth is I lied to you.

422
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:58,467
This is so
embarrassing.

423
00:15:58,534 --> 00:16:02,500
Um, I'm in a bit of a
pinch financially.

424
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:05,700
I invested in the market
at the wrong time.

425
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:07,433
But it-it'll all turn
around, I mean,

426
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,834
the market is looking up.

427
00:16:09,901 --> 00:16:11,700
Yes?

428
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:15,201
But in the short term...

429
00:16:15,268 --> 00:16:18,268
I'm a bit strapped.

430
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:22,867
I'm sorry.

431
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:26,034
I am truly...

432
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:29,101
truly sorry.

433
00:16:31,134 --> 00:16:32,734
(sighs)

434
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:33,767
It's okay.

435
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:35,433
I just--

436
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,467
Why did you lie to me?

437
00:16:37,534 --> 00:16:40,534
I, um...

438
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,467
I'm the big sister.

439
00:16:45,534 --> 00:16:47,467
I wanted to take care of you.

440
00:16:47,534 --> 00:16:51,767
I didn't want you to have
to take care of me.

441
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:01,300
I'm glad to help.

442
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:03,367
I really am.

443
00:17:05,034 --> 00:17:06,967
But...

444
00:17:07,034 --> 00:17:09,467
if I am paying for everything,

445
00:17:09,534 --> 00:17:12,467
<i>then I get to choose the couch.</i>

446
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:14,333
We're going with white leather.

447
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,300
Okay. Cool.

448
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:18,101
White leather it is.

449
00:17:29,434 --> 00:17:33,800
("Poker Face" by Lady GaGa
playing)

450
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:37,833
* I wanna hold em' like they do
in Texas Plays *

451
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,900
* Fold em', let em' hit me,
raise it *

454
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:47,534

00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:50,534
* I'll play the one
that's on his heart... *

456
00:17:50,601 --> 00:17:53,000
Guys, one second.

457
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:56,100
Um... you ready?

458
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:58,100
I can't.

459
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:00,134
I'm sorry. I thought I could,
but I can't.

460
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,301
Come on, baby.

461
00:18:01,367 --> 00:18:02,933
I know you can do this.

462
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,900
Everyone's going
to be staring at me.

463
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:06,900
(sighs)

464
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:08,900
Not if you walk
by me.

465
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:11,267
I mean, hello?
Eight months pregnant.

466
00:18:11,334 --> 00:18:13,734
Yeah. If things get
bad, you could hide
behind her stomach.

467
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,534
DIXON:
Come on,

468
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:17,434
baby, I know you can
do this.

469
00:18:19,501 --> 00:18:21,100
Okay.

470
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,434
Yes!
Okay.
Yes!

471
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,467
Yes!

472
00:18:23,534 --> 00:18:25,534
Come on, girl.
My lady.

473
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:30,501
*

474
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:39,301
* The end begins just
as it starts *

475
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:41,634
* And leaves me wondering

476
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:45,067
* What we left behind

477
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:48,434
Come here.

478
00:18:48,501 --> 00:18:50,000
Come on, man.

479
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:53,367
* You told me not to talk

480
00:18:53,434 --> 00:18:55,833
* But please explain
my thoughts *

481
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,867
* That float around my mind

482
00:18:58,933 --> 00:19:01,867
Can we just
go inside?

483
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,301
Oh.

484
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:05,301
Sure.

485
00:19:05,367 --> 00:19:07,334
* So take a step back

486
00:19:07,401 --> 00:19:12,967
* Will you be all right,
feel all right? *

487
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:15,000
ADRIANNA:
Whoa!

488
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:17,334
<i>Do you think that they
shot The Poseidon
Adventure here?</i>

489
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:18,933
Look at that jerk.

490
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,100
ADRIANNA:
Hey, don't worry about Ty.

491
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:23,933
All those sleepless
nights--

492
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,967
deciding whether or not
to raise the baby.

493
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:27,701
He should know
about that.

494
00:19:27,768 --> 00:19:29,734
He should know what
it's been like.

495
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,234
And I'm gonna tell him that
right now.

496
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:34,200
Ow! Ow.

497
00:19:34,267 --> 00:19:35,867
Ow. Ow. Ow.
You all right?

498
00:19:35,933 --> 00:19:37,933
Hey, have a seat.
Uh...

499
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:40,800
Whoo! I'm-I'm--
I'm fine.

500
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:43,567
It's just a false
labor pain.

501
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:45,567
You know, there's a difference

502
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:48,567
between false labor pains
and fake labor pains.

503
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:51,567
Just ignore Ty.

504
00:19:56,034 --> 00:19:57,634
CHARLIE:
That's really unfair.

505
00:19:57,701 --> 00:19:58,867
You should be up
there!

506
00:19:58,933 --> 00:19:59,900
Oh, no, no.

507
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:01,200
Really, that's okay.

508
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:02,434
No, you should be.

509
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,833
You're one of the five prettiest
girls at West Bev.

510
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,134
I guess just because
you're new.

511
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,167
DIXON (laughing):
Whoa!

512
00:20:09,234 --> 00:20:12,334
I'm nominated for
Prom King?

513
00:20:12,401 --> 00:20:14,334
Silver! Hey!

514
00:20:14,401 --> 00:20:17,000
Really glad
you could make it.

515
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:18,167
Me, too.

516
00:20:18,234 --> 00:20:21,167
Thanks.

517
00:20:21,234 --> 00:20:23,301
Hmm...
See?

518
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:25,034
What did I tell you?

519
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,434
Everybody's being nice, huh?

520
00:20:26,501 --> 00:20:28,167
Sure.

521
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:29,601
I'm sorry, you're right.

522
00:20:29,668 --> 00:20:31,134
Everyone's being nice.

523
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,534
They're treating me like
I have a terminal disease,

524
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:34,701
but they're being nice.

525
00:20:34,768 --> 00:20:35,867
That's not true, come on.

526
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:37,034
Yeah, whatever,
I'm fine.

527
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,167
I can deal with this
for one night, right?

528
00:20:49,618 --> 00:20:51,750
* I go ooh ooh

529
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,217
* You go aah aah

530
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:54,950

* I wanna wanna wanna

00:21:01,217 --> 00:21:02,750
* Gimme gimme gimme
what you got *

535
00:21:02,817 --> 00:21:05,150
* 'Cause I can't wait
wait wait anymore *

536
00:21:05,217 --> 00:21:07,284
(chanting):
Go Charlie, go Charlie!

537
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:08,850
* ...talk about the
consequence *

538
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:10,451
* 'Cause right now
you're the only thing *

539
00:21:10,517 --> 00:21:11,950
* That's making
any sense to me *

540
00:21:12,017 --> 00:21:13,217
Come on.
Oh...

541
00:21:13,284 --> 00:21:15,217
Teachers don't dance.

542
00:21:15,284 --> 00:21:17,150
Does this count as dancing?

543
00:21:17,217 --> 00:21:19,017
I think that's okay.

544
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:21,718
Okay, what if I do this?

545
00:21:21,783 --> 00:21:23,184
Is that okay?
Mm-hmm.

546
00:21:23,251 --> 00:21:27,251
And what if we just sway
back and forth like this?

547
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:28,284
Is that okay?

548
00:21:28,351 --> 00:21:29,451
Um...

549
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,984
I, uh, want to introduce
you to a friend of mine.

550
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,251
Hey, Kelly.

551
00:21:35,317 --> 00:21:36,351
Jen.

552
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:38,783
Ms. Taylor.

553
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:39,984
You two know each other?

554
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,417
Oh, Ms. Taylor was
my guidance counselor

555
00:21:41,484 --> 00:21:42,651
back in the
good old days.

556
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,517
Call me Kelly, please.

557
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:46,584
Wow, how about that?

558
00:21:48,317 --> 00:21:50,317
Oh, cool band, huh?

559
00:21:50,384 --> 00:21:52,718
Yeah.

560
00:21:54,718 --> 00:21:56,618
I got like 20 cases of beer

561
00:21:56,684 --> 00:21:58,384
and Topher's brother
brought over vodka,

562
00:21:58,451 --> 00:21:59,750
gin, whiskey, bourbon...

563
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:01,417
Wait, are whiskey and
bourbon the same thing?

564
00:22:01,484 --> 00:22:02,817
Anyway, all we have to do

565
00:22:02,883 --> 00:22:04,351
is bring it in
from the garage

566
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:06,517
after my parents leave
for Palm Springs.

567
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:08,551
It's going to be so much fun!

568
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,651
Thank you, Phoebe Abrams.

569
00:22:11,718 --> 00:22:14,017
*

570
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,718
(sighing)

571
00:22:15,783 --> 00:22:17,850
This has been fun.

572
00:22:17,917 --> 00:22:19,451
Oh, yeah, totally.

573
00:22:19,517 --> 00:22:21,317
We'll have to go out
again sometime,

574
00:22:21,384 --> 00:22:23,050
you know, under less
formal circumstances.

575
00:22:23,117 --> 00:22:25,917
Oh, um...

576
00:22:25,984 --> 00:22:28,150
Look, Charlie,
I'm not interested.

577
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:30,651
Romantically.

578
00:22:30,718 --> 00:22:33,317
Then why did you say yes?

579
00:22:33,384 --> 00:22:34,684
Well, you asked.

580
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,551
And you said you'd be thrilled.

581
00:22:36,618 --> 00:22:38,817
Well, I didn't have
a date and I knew how much

582
00:22:38,883 --> 00:22:40,184
you wanted to go with me.

583
00:22:40,251 --> 00:22:42,050
So, it was a pity date?

584
00:22:42,117 --> 00:22:44,150
I was just trying to be nice.

585
00:22:44,217 --> 00:22:45,551
Well, you know what
would've been nice?

586
00:22:45,618 --> 00:22:47,050
Being honest with me.

587
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:49,517
I could've asked a girl who
actually wanted to go with me.

588
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:51,484
Who actually was thrilled.

589
00:22:51,551 --> 00:22:54,984
You know what, take
your pity and shove it!

590
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:59,284
* Christy,
are you doing okay? *

591
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:02,850
* A rose that won't bloom... *

592
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:09,417
* The lights are out,
and I barely know you *

593
00:23:09,484 --> 00:23:14,484
* We're going up and the
place is slowing down *

594
00:23:14,551 --> 00:23:19,417
* I knew you'd come around *

595
00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:23,017
* You captivate me, something
about you has got me *

596
00:23:23,084 --> 00:23:25,150
Hey.
Hey, how are you?

597
00:23:25,217 --> 00:23:27,850
Where's this Liam I've
heard so much about?

598
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:30,084
Oh.

599
00:23:34,084 --> 00:23:36,050
Seems like the life
of the party.

600
00:23:36,117 --> 00:23:40,584
Oh, yeah, he's
not a prom person.

601
00:23:40,651 --> 00:23:41,883
He's just here for me.

602
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,883
It's sweet,
he really likes me.

603
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,817
I'm sure he does.

604
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:49,117
<i>* Just take me on the floor
* Da da da da, da da da da </i>

605
00:23:49,184 --> 00:23:51,351
<i>* I can give you more
* Da da da da </i>

606
00:23:51,417 --> 00:23:53,251
<i>* Da da da da </i>

607
00:23:53,317 --> 00:23:55,084
(Harry whistles)

608
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,150
Excuse me! Can I borrow
this mic for a second?

609
00:23:57,217 --> 00:23:58,984
Thank you.
Uh, hey, everybody.

610
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:02,084
Quick announcement.
I just, I want to tell you

611
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,017
that I am really stoked
about the after-prom party

612
00:24:05,084 --> 00:24:06,451
at Phoebe Abrams's house
tonight, all right?

613
00:24:06,517 --> 00:24:09,417
I will be there with
a bunch of my friends

614
00:24:09,484 --> 00:24:11,251
from the Beverly Hills
Police Department.

615
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,117
So, anyway,

616
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:15,184
I'll see you there.

617
00:24:15,251 --> 00:24:16,750
Carry on.

618
00:24:16,817 --> 00:24:19,684
Who the hell told him?

619
00:24:21,284 --> 00:24:25,084
I know who it was.

620
00:24:26,917 --> 00:24:29,783
*

621
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:33,651
* The lights are out
and I barely know you *

622
00:24:33,718 --> 00:24:35,417
Hello, Ms. Taylor.

623
00:24:35,484 --> 00:24:37,150
Kelly.
Kelly.

624
00:24:37,217 --> 00:24:38,718
So, how funny that you and I

625
00:24:38,783 --> 00:24:40,883
would end up having
the same taste in men?

626
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,317
I'm sorry?

627
00:24:43,384 --> 00:24:44,551
Didn't you and Ryan?

628
00:24:44,618 --> 00:24:47,217
Oh, come on, I was
totally picking up vibes.

629
00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:50,351
Um... uh, yes, we dated.

630
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:51,783
Briefly a while ago.

631
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,850
I thought so.

632
00:24:52,917 --> 00:24:54,384
I'm rarely wrong
about vibes.

633
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,484
You know, I think academics
are terribly sexy.

634
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:58,017
And I don't just
mean teachers.

635
00:24:58,084 --> 00:24:59,651
When I was at Yale,
I briefly dated

636
00:24:59,718 --> 00:25:01,783
someone in the
Registrar's office.

637
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,618
You don't say.
Mmm.

638
00:25:03,684 --> 00:25:05,284
He was pretty much
a bore, actually.

639
00:25:05,351 --> 00:25:06,584
Although I did get to read

640
00:25:06,651 --> 00:25:09,384
my, uh, recommendation
letters from high school.

641
00:25:09,451 --> 00:25:10,984
That was sweet.

642
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,684
Most of them were
rather glowing.

643
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,184
There was one, though,

644
00:25:15,251 --> 00:25:17,684
that was slightly
less than glowing.

645
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,950
I wrote that letter

646
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,517
because it's my job
to give the colleges

647
00:25:21,584 --> 00:25:24,084
an honest appraisal
of the students.

648
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,584
Uh-huh.

649
00:25:25,651 --> 00:25:27,150
You said that, in your opinion,

650
00:25:27,217 --> 00:25:29,783
I was "a narcissist
with no moral compass."

651
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,917
(laughing)

652
00:25:30,984 --> 00:25:32,584
Did you really think

653
00:25:32,651 --> 00:25:34,484
Yale was gonna listen to you?

654
00:25:34,551 --> 00:25:36,517
A guidance counselor?

655
00:25:36,584 --> 00:25:38,117
I had an impeccable transcript.

656
00:25:38,184 --> 00:25:40,150
I was president
of the senior class.

657
00:25:40,217 --> 00:25:42,317
I'm a legacy.

658
00:25:42,384 --> 00:25:43,618
I got in early.

659
00:25:43,684 --> 00:25:45,451
You stole Liz Hartigan's
term paper.

660
00:25:45,517 --> 00:25:47,451
God, you're still on about that?

661
00:25:47,517 --> 00:25:48,783
You're like Ahab.

662
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,417
Man.

663
00:25:50,484 --> 00:25:51,584
Such a busybody.

664
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:53,384
Drop the innocent act, okay?

665
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,451
Because I know what kind
of person you really are.

666
00:25:55,517 --> 00:25:56,817
Self-centered,
devious, willing to do

667
00:25:56,883 --> 00:25:58,684
whatever it takes
to get what you want.

668
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,551
Oh, take it easy, okay?

669
00:26:01,618 --> 00:26:03,351
I haven't even
slept with him yet.

670
00:26:03,417 --> 00:26:05,484
No, this has nothing
to do with Ryan.

671
00:26:05,551 --> 00:26:07,184
It has to do with you stealing

672
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:09,251
that girl's term paper right
out of the teacher's desk,

673
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,284
all so you could beat her
out as Valedictorian.

674
00:26:11,351 --> 00:26:15,651
Ugh, I am appalled that
you think so little of me.

675
00:26:15,718 --> 00:26:18,750
Simply appalled.

676
00:26:18,817 --> 00:26:22,750
Oh, hey, being that you're
a guidance counselor,

677
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:26,217
maybe you could give me
a little guidance about Ryan.

678
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,284
Tell me, Ms. Taylor,

679
00:26:28,351 --> 00:26:30,984
what does he like in bed?

680
00:26:32,017 --> 00:26:34,484
* Please don't stop *

681
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,417
(drumroll)

682
00:26:36,484 --> 00:26:38,718
Ladies and gentleman,

683
00:26:38,783 --> 00:26:42,551
welcome to the Prommies!

684
00:26:42,618 --> 00:26:45,517
(applause, cheering)

685
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:51,451
Tonight we have a terrific
bunch of nominees.

686
00:26:51,517 --> 00:26:53,451
And I'm sure
they would all agree,

687
00:26:53,517 --> 00:26:56,284
it's an honor to be nominated.

688
00:26:56,351 --> 00:26:57,718
But it sucks to lose!

689
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:58,950
(mild laughter)

690
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,284
So, without further ado,

691
00:27:00,351 --> 00:27:04,251
the Prom King...

692
00:27:04,317 --> 00:27:07,050
is Dixon Wilson!

693
00:27:07,117 --> 00:27:09,117
(applause, cheering)

694
00:27:10,284 --> 00:27:12,117
Yeah!

695
00:27:12,184 --> 00:27:13,150
Whoo-hoo!

696
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:15,817
Dixon!
(whistling)

697
00:27:15,883 --> 00:27:17,618
Whoo!

698
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:21,551
Thanks.

699
00:27:21,618 --> 00:27:23,950
Wow, um...

700
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,850
Well, this is, uh...

701
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:27,950
This is pretty cool.

702
00:27:28,017 --> 00:27:31,150
(chuckles)
Um, I wanna, I want you guys

703
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:33,251
to give it up for
my fellow nominees,

704
00:27:33,317 --> 00:27:35,317
who are also very, very cool.

705
00:27:35,384 --> 00:27:36,517
Thank you, guys.

706
00:27:36,584 --> 00:27:39,718
(cheering)

707
00:27:43,217 --> 00:27:45,817
And now, the moment you've
all been waiting for.

708
00:27:45,883 --> 00:27:47,817
The Sophomore Prom Queen.

709
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:50,384
And might I say,
you're all lovely ladies.

710
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:53,050
Not my type, but lovely.

711
00:27:53,117 --> 00:27:56,050
Oh, wow.

712
00:27:56,117 --> 00:27:59,651
Uh, it seems that the
winner is a write-in.

713
00:27:59,718 --> 00:28:01,551
What?!

714
00:28:01,618 --> 00:28:03,050
(nervous laughter):
Is that fair?

715
00:28:04,217 --> 00:28:07,651
And the Prommie goes to...

716
00:28:07,718 --> 00:28:09,651
Erin Silver!

717
00:28:12,251 --> 00:28:13,950
Whoa!
(applause, cheers)

718
00:28:14,017 --> 00:28:15,117
Whoo!

719
00:28:15,184 --> 00:28:17,184
Go!
Get up there!

720
00:28:17,251 --> 00:28:19,417
Get up there, go!
You get up there!

721
00:28:23,718 --> 00:28:27,184
See? I told you
everybody supports you.

722
00:28:27,251 --> 00:28:28,684
Did you do this?

723
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,817
Did you get everybody
to write me in?

724
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:32,584
Well, it was my idea,

725
00:28:32,651 --> 00:28:35,184
but everybody here
likes you, Silver.

726
00:28:35,251 --> 00:28:43,150
Go get your Prommie.

727
00:28:43,217 --> 00:28:45,284
Wow.

728
00:28:45,351 --> 00:28:47,618
Thank you, guys, so much.

729
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,050
Um, I'll tell you,

730
00:28:50,117 --> 00:28:53,584
uh, this has been
a hard year for me.

731
00:28:53,651 --> 00:28:56,384
It's made me question

732
00:28:56,451 --> 00:28:58,417
everything.

733
00:28:58,484 --> 00:29:00,517
Who I am.

734
00:29:00,584 --> 00:29:02,417
What I like.

735
00:29:02,484 --> 00:29:03,883
What I'm all about.

736
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:07,384
So, thank you.

737
00:29:07,451 --> 00:29:09,850
For reminding me.

738
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:14,417
This is not me.

739
00:29:14,484 --> 00:29:16,651
I hate proms.

740
00:29:16,718 --> 00:29:18,517
I do.
I'm sorry, but I really do.

741
00:29:18,584 --> 00:29:21,517
They're all about
conformity and popularity

742
00:29:21,584 --> 00:29:25,050
and all these things
I really detest.

743
00:29:28,551 --> 00:29:30,950
All I wanted recently
was to fit in.

744
00:29:31,017 --> 00:29:32,817
And I tried really hard.

745
00:29:32,883 --> 00:29:34,950
I mean, look at me.

746
00:29:35,017 --> 00:29:38,217
I paid good money,
real human earth dollars,

747
00:29:38,284 --> 00:29:40,750
to have some foul-smelling
orange chemicals

748
00:29:40,817 --> 00:29:42,551
sprayed on my body

749
00:29:42,618 --> 00:29:45,750
to approximate the
effect of sun damage.

750
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:49,783
I have pieces of God knows
what kind of toxic plastic

751
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,551
superglued to my fingernails.

752
00:29:51,618 --> 00:29:54,551
And these shoes...

753
00:29:54,618 --> 00:29:58,150
are hideously,
hideously painful.

754
00:29:58,217 --> 00:29:59,517
At this moment, I'm telling you,

755
00:29:59,584 --> 00:30:02,917
I cannot for the life
of me feel my toes.

756
00:30:05,783 --> 00:30:08,783
And I want to feel my toes.

757
00:30:11,651 --> 00:30:14,517
So, maybe I am a freak.

758
00:30:14,584 --> 00:30:17,050
But that is better than being

759
00:30:17,117 --> 00:30:20,251
some weird zombie,
prom-loving loser.

760
00:30:21,917 --> 00:30:23,651
I don't know exactly who I am.

761
00:30:23,718 --> 00:30:26,783
But I do know who I'm not.

762
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:30,517
And I am no prom queen.

763
00:30:31,551 --> 00:30:34,517
Let me help you with that.

764
00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:36,317
So, thanks.

765
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,984
But no thanks.

766
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:52,467
(upbeat rock music playing)

767
00:30:55,534 --> 00:31:00,400
* All the gold and the guns

768
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:02,967
* In the world...

769
00:31:03,034 --> 00:31:04,801
Hello, Ethan.

770
00:31:04,867 --> 00:31:06,801
Hey, Mr. Matthews,
so listen...

771
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:09,267
I'm-I'm not gonna go
to the lacrosse camp.

772
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:10,467
What?

773
00:31:10,534 --> 00:31:12,367
I'm gonna go visit my dad
in Montana.

774
00:31:12,434 --> 00:31:13,834
Go backpacking
for a couple months.

775
00:31:13,901 --> 00:31:15,068
Well, you sure?

776
00:31:15,134 --> 00:31:16,767
I mean, you're giving up
a huge opportunity.

777
00:31:16,834 --> 00:31:18,267
There's gonna be college scouts
there and...

778
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:20,600
I know, but, look,

779
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:24,001
I-I may not be sure
what I'm about exactly,

780
00:31:24,068 --> 00:31:26,934
but it's not lacrosse.

781
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:29,101
I know that.

782
00:31:37,467 --> 00:31:39,168
Why'd you tell your dad
about my party?

783
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,434
I didn't.

784
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,068
Yeah, right.

785
00:31:42,134 --> 00:31:44,101
Wait. Is that
what everyone thinks?

786
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:46,267
They don't think. They know.

787
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:49,001
Everyone saw you
in your dad's video, Annie.

788
00:31:49,068 --> 00:31:50,467
You're a rat.

789
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:51,901
(laughs)

790
00:31:51,967 --> 00:31:53,600
I didn't tell my dad.

791
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:54,801
Of course you didn't.

792
00:31:54,867 --> 00:31:57,534
Then why do people
think I did?

793
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,867
Who cares what
people think?

794
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:03,734
Um, I'll be
right back, okay?

795
00:32:03,801 --> 00:32:05,801
Yeah.

796
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,001
Hey.

797
00:32:09,068 --> 00:32:11,034
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

798
00:32:11,101 --> 00:32:14,168
Thank you so much for getting
everyone to write my name in.

799
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:16,101
It was just what I needed,

800
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:17,534
you know?

801
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,034
It, like,
woke me up.

802
00:32:19,101 --> 00:32:20,967
I feel so much better.

803
00:32:21,034 --> 00:32:22,667
(sighs)

804
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:25,134
I want to come back
to West Beverly, Dixon.

805
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,267
I'm ready to come back.

806
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:31,267
That's great.

807
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,134
What's wrong?

808
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,867
You okay?

809
00:32:36,934 --> 00:32:38,634
Why do you care?

810
00:32:38,701 --> 00:32:41,534
I'm just a zombie,
prom-loving loser.

811
00:32:51,701 --> 00:32:52,967
ETHAN:
Silver.

812
00:32:53,034 --> 00:32:54,967
That speech was...

813
00:32:55,034 --> 00:32:57,400
awesome.

814
00:32:59,168 --> 00:33:01,068
Thanks.

815
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:08,267
*

816
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:11,434
God, it's such a drag they
don't serve any liquor.

817
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,034
Yeah, well, it is
the sophomore prom, so...

818
00:33:14,101 --> 00:33:16,200
(phone ringing)

819
00:33:18,734 --> 00:33:20,867
Uh, sorry. I-I
have to take this.

820
00:33:20,934 --> 00:33:22,101
Uh, yeah. No problem.

821
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:23,701
Hurry back.
I will.

822
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:31,101
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

823
00:33:31,168 --> 00:33:32,934
Yeah, sure.
What's up?

824
00:33:33,001 --> 00:33:35,701
Uh, there is something
you should know.

825
00:33:35,767 --> 00:33:37,567
Jen-- not a nice person.

826
00:33:37,634 --> 00:33:39,333
I know her pretty well.

827
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,400
She is a compulsive liar.

828
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:43,567
She's practically a sociopath.

829
00:33:43,634 --> 00:33:46,001
She used to have everybody
snowed over, but not me.

830
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:47,168
Look, I'm sorry.

831
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,701
I, uh... I should
have asked you

832
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:50,901
if it was cool for
me to bring a date.

833
00:33:50,967 --> 00:33:52,467
I didn't mean to
disrespect you, Kelly.

834
00:33:52,534 --> 00:33:53,634
Wait. No. No, no, no.

835
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:55,400
I just... I thought
we were cool

836
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:56,901
after that night,
and you know,

837
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:58,333
we said no
strings attached.

838
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,901
You know what?
I'm not jealous.

839
00:33:59,967 --> 00:34:02,200
I am trying
to be your friend here.

840
00:34:02,267 --> 00:34:03,967
Okay.

841
00:34:04,034 --> 00:34:05,867
I'm...

842
00:34:05,934 --> 00:34:08,034
I'm not interested
in you anymore.

843
00:34:08,101 --> 00:34:09,834
I'm not.

844
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:13,034
Is there someone else?

845
00:34:14,934 --> 00:34:17,068
I've moved on.

846
00:34:22,934 --> 00:34:25,134
That's enough.

847
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,333
I'm hanging up on you, Olivier.

848
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:32,467
You see, this is exactly why
I want a divorce.

849
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:37,400
* Get hot

850
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:40,068
* Get too close
to the flame... *

851
00:34:40,134 --> 00:34:42,434
It's nice getting air.

852
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,267
I could tell you were
claustrophobic in there.

853
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,534
And I was, too,
actually.

854
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,667
Have you ever been
on the Paramount lot before?

855
00:34:52,767 --> 00:34:55,367
Oh, look,
they're shooting something.

856
00:34:57,867 --> 00:35:00,168
Want to walk by and see
if we get discovered?

857
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:01,367
Definitely not.

858
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:03,534
Yeah. Me, either.

859
00:35:04,901 --> 00:35:07,034
Want to walk
to New York?

860
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:12,467
So, you're probably
one of those people

861
00:35:12,534 --> 00:35:14,567
who thinks New York
is better than L.A.

862
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:15,934
(laughs)

863
00:35:16,001 --> 00:35:17,200
Give L.A. time.

864
00:35:17,267 --> 00:35:18,400
It has everything.

865
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:21,567
Mountains, beaches,
oh, great weather.

866
00:35:21,634 --> 00:35:23,967
<i>There is no
weather here.</i>

867
00:35:24,034 --> 00:35:25,901
I miss the snow.

868
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:27,701
Ms. Taylor.

869
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:32,200
Oh. Hey, you two.

870
00:35:32,267 --> 00:35:35,101
I was just getting ready
to head back inside.

871
00:35:35,168 --> 00:35:38,001
Liam, I'm glad to see
you came to the prom.

872
00:35:38,068 --> 00:35:39,634
And I'm sure your stepfather

873
00:35:39,701 --> 00:35:41,333
will be glad, too.

874
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,233
It's a step
in the right direction.

875
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,333
Have fun exploring the lot.

876
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:49,134
What did she mean,

877
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,600
your stepfather
will be glad you came?

878
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:53,434
Ah...
Liam.

879
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,901
(clears throat)

880
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:56,200
What did she mean?

881
00:35:56,267 --> 00:35:57,667
I don't know.

882
00:35:57,734 --> 00:36:01,434
My stepdad wants me to get
involved with school stuff.

883
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,001
(sighs)

884
00:36:04,068 --> 00:36:07,134
Is that why you
asked me to the prom?

885
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,500
What does it matter?

886
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,233
I'm here.

887
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,233
You know why
it matters?

888
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,300
Because I like
you, okay?

889
00:36:14,367 --> 00:36:16,934
I don't care if
it's not cool.

890
00:36:17,001 --> 00:36:19,667
I'm tired of
pretending.

891
00:36:19,734 --> 00:36:21,634
I actually like you.

892
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:23,233
And everyone said
that I was a fool,

893
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,801
you don't treat me
right, and it's true.

894
00:36:24,867 --> 00:36:26,134
I mean,
all night,

895
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,834
you haven't wanted to dance
or take photos or talk,

896
00:36:29,901 --> 00:36:31,068
but still, stupid me

897
00:36:31,134 --> 00:36:33,001
just kept on
defending you.

898
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:35,300
I was, like, "Oh, my God,
he invited me to prom."

899
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:37,567
"Oh, my God, he cleaned out
the trash in his car."

900
00:36:37,634 --> 00:36:39,534
"Oh my God, he bought me
a black orchid corsage."

901
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,634
I mean, why did you get me
this corsage?

902
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:46,101
I knew I was supposed to.

903
00:36:46,168 --> 00:36:48,701
But it's a black orchid.

904
00:36:48,767 --> 00:36:50,934
That's what they had
in the store.
That's not true.

905
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:52,434
You have to special order
black orchids.

906
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,134
I know because
they're my favorite flower, but

907
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,101
the question is,

908
00:36:56,168 --> 00:36:58,467
how did you know
they're my favorite?

909
00:36:58,534 --> 00:37:00,101
Did you ask someone?

910
00:37:00,168 --> 00:37:01,467
(sighs)

911
00:37:01,534 --> 00:37:03,068
No. I...

912
00:37:07,867 --> 00:37:11,801
You looked on my Facebook page,
didn't you?

913
00:37:11,867 --> 00:37:14,634
You did.

914
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:16,034
You wanted to learn about me,

915
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:17,667
so you looked
on my Facebook page,

916
00:37:17,734 --> 00:37:19,567
and then, you looked
at my personal interests,

917
00:37:19,634 --> 00:37:22,300
and in between spicy tuna rolls
and the smell of Neiman Marcus,

918
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:25,134
you saw black
orchids, so
you went out

919
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,500
and ordered one for me
to make me happy.

920
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:30,534
(laughs)

921
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,467
Because...

922
00:37:34,534 --> 00:37:36,934
you like me.

923
00:37:39,867 --> 00:37:41,867
Admit it.

924
00:37:43,434 --> 00:37:45,534
You like me.

925
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:53,168
You like me, don't you?

926
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:02,734
Yeah.

927
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:08,600
(rock music playing)

928
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:10,168
Freeze! Don't move
a muscle!

929
00:38:10,233 --> 00:38:11,467
Oh.

930
00:38:11,534 --> 00:38:12,634
Oh, my God, Harry.

931
00:38:12,701 --> 00:38:14,467
Hey, I was being
the bad cop.

932
00:38:14,534 --> 00:38:15,867
(laughing)
Oh.

933
00:38:15,934 --> 00:38:17,168
So, you having fun?

934
00:38:17,233 --> 00:38:19,367
Oh, yeah, totally.

935
00:38:19,434 --> 00:38:22,101
Okay, not totally.

936
00:38:22,168 --> 00:38:24,534
I tried to give
a friend advice,

937
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,934
and I should have
just stayed out of it.

938
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:28,734
No. That-That's not you.

939
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:30,901
Right, 'cause
I'm a busybody.

940
00:38:30,967 --> 00:38:32,467
No, that's not
what I meant.

941
00:38:32,534 --> 00:38:33,867
You care about people, yeah.

942
00:38:33,934 --> 00:38:35,434
You're passionate.

943
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,801
And whoever
this friend is, if

944
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:40,434
they can't see that,
then, he's an idiot.

945
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,967
<i>Or she's an idiot,
but I'm guessing that it's a he.</i>

946
00:38:45,034 --> 00:38:47,734
Thank you, Harry.

947
00:38:47,801 --> 00:38:49,801
Mm. I mean it.

948
00:38:50,834 --> 00:38:52,467
(phone ringing)

949
00:38:52,534 --> 00:38:54,934
Yeah.

950
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:56,200
It's my wife.

951
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,333
She-She wouldn't go
to prom with me.

952
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,834
Oh.
Maybe I should
punish her

953
00:38:59,901 --> 00:39:00,934
and not answer it.

954
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:02,867
Go, go.

955
00:39:02,934 --> 00:39:04,367
All right.

956
00:39:06,168 --> 00:39:07,834
Hey, sweetie.

957
00:39:07,901 --> 00:39:09,967
Yeah.

958
00:39:10,034 --> 00:39:11,434
Mm-hmm.

959
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,634
*

960
00:39:14,701 --> 00:39:16,101
What was that for?

961
00:39:16,168 --> 00:39:17,634
For being a jackass.

962
00:39:17,701 --> 00:39:19,500
Dude, I'm so sick
of looking at you.

963
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:21,434
Do you know what
Adrianna's gone through?

964
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,600
(grunts)

965
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:23,967
(crowd clamoring)
MAN:
Oh, damn!

966
00:39:24,034 --> 00:39:24,967
What's wrong with you?

967
00:39:25,034 --> 00:39:26,333
MAN:
Get him, Navid!
Get him!

968
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,500
MAN:
Kick his ass!
Get him!

969
00:39:27,567 --> 00:39:29,267
Navid?

970
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,734
(grunting)

971
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:31,867
Navid!

972
00:39:32,867 --> 00:39:34,934
Navid?

973
00:39:35,001 --> 00:39:36,967
My water just broke.

974
00:39:38,901 --> 00:39:41,534
I think I'm going into labor.

975
00:39:43,667 --> 00:39:46,001
Man, your stepfather
sounds like an ass.

976
00:39:46,068 --> 00:39:48,367
What about your mom?
Can't you talk to her?

977
00:39:48,434 --> 00:39:51,600
No. She's...
changed.

978
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:54,734
I mean, we used to be tight,
but since she married him,

979
00:39:54,801 --> 00:39:56,801
she's totally different.

980
00:39:58,168 --> 00:40:00,867
I don't know. I tell
you, I'd rather be poor

981
00:40:00,934 --> 00:40:02,634
than rich and
live with him.

982
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:06,300
That sucks.

983
00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:08,467
Yeah.

984
00:40:14,068 --> 00:40:23,233
* Sometimes it just don't make
no sense at all *

985
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:30,034
* I'm still trying
to find a reason *

986
00:40:30,101 --> 00:40:32,701
* For it all

987
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:35,300
* My life

988
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:42,400
* I thought it would be
something beautiful *

989
00:40:42,467 --> 00:40:47,001
* And now it feels

990
00:40:47,068 --> 00:40:51,934
* Like there's nothing
there at all *

991
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:54,168
* Anymore

992
00:40:54,233 --> 00:40:59,001
* Give us the sunshine
instead of the rain *

993
00:40:59,068 --> 00:41:00,834
* Give us the sunshine...
