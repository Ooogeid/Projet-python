<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,263
Mr. Cannon sexually harassed me.

3
00:00:04,712 --> 00:00:07,048
- Why are ruining my life?
- Nothing happened,

4
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:08,995
- I lied.
- How could you even ask

5
00:00:09,162 --> 00:00:11,861
if you could go to Australia?
She doesn't know about the gambling

6
00:00:12,028 --> 00:00:14,878
- about the breaking into school.
- Then you should tell me about it.

7
00:00:15,045 --> 00:00:17,267
- What the hell?
- Is he stalking you?

8
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:20,092
- We could be friends.
- There's just too much that's happened.

9
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:22,647
I got this for Ade. I'm gonna
put it in her dressing room

10
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:25,608
with a note on it that says,
"Meet me on the roof."

11
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,861
We're off to NY.
Come out and see us there.

12
00:00:28,342 --> 00:00:30,956
You know how long he's been
playing tennis? Since he was four.

13
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:32,866
You wanna ruins that for him?

14
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,536
Our relationship, it's too much for me,
and this isn't working.

15
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:40,830
- It was a mistake.
- Totally idiotic.

16
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:43,311
- About the tackle shop.
- Just gonna take some time.

17
00:00:43,478 --> 00:00:45,920
- I could help speed things up.
- We had to let Rosa go.

18
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,807
- Why?
- She stole some coins

19
00:00:47,974 --> 00:00:50,971
- from Jeffrey's collection.
- Can I see you? I really need to talk.

20
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:54,763
Can we talk later? I'm actually in bed.
I think I have the flu.

21
00:00:57,966 --> 00:00:59,643
I could really use your advice.

22
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,771
Who's Jay Boyd? Why did you act like
you were hiding something?

23
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,147
Jennifer Clark?

24
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:07,855
- Dr. Boyd will see you now.
- Surprise!

25
00:01:18,206 --> 00:01:19,915
There's your baby, Jen.

26
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:23,901
Can you believe it?

27
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,431
Not really.

28
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:31,591
It's just Jen's hardly human. Who
would have thought she could reproduce?

29
00:01:32,063 --> 00:01:34,761
What's the matter, Naomi?
Are you disappointed that I'm pregnant?

30
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,171
I bet you were hoping I was having a

31
00:01:37,338 --> 00:01:40,161
love affair
with a coke-addled chimpanzee.

32
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:43,436
Sorry, hon.
Nothing that blackmail-worthy.

33
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:46,356
I don't know. I'm not ruling
out the whole chimp thing.

34
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:50,521
What do you mean you don't validate?

35
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:52,996
I don't have money for this.
What am I supposed to do?

36
00:01:53,163 --> 00:01:54,030
Get a job.

37
00:01:58,095 --> 00:02:00,601
<i>At 24 weeks,
you'll be feeling some kicking.</i>

38
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:04,749
<i>Please.
She's a regular David Beckham.</i>

39
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:06,319
<i>All right.</i>

40
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,218
<i>Excellent...</i>

41
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:12,071
<i>You'll need to see Dr.
Boyd in two weeks.</i>

42
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:24,546
So, are you going to tell
your step-dad that you took the coins?

43
00:02:26,536 --> 00:02:28,489
If I do, he'll send me away.

44
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,726
Or I don't know.
Press criminal charges probably.

45
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:32,985
My life,

46
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:37,031
school, surfing, friends, all that
would be over. I'd never see you again.

47
00:02:38,756 --> 00:02:40,410
Or, see anyone from West Bev.

48
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:44,142
Maybe you can make this right.

49
00:02:44,309 --> 00:02:46,576
You could earn money and
send it to your housekeeper,

50
00:02:46,743 --> 00:02:50,365
or you could help her find
a new job or something.

51
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:53,882
Maybe. I don't know. I just...

52
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:57,039
I messed up, and I hurt someone.

53
00:02:59,003 --> 00:03:00,101
You're lucky.

54
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:01,681
You've got options.

55
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,159
Sometimes you mess up,

56
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:06,853
and there's no way
that you could ever fix it.

57
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:22,834
- You were amazing.
- No, you were amazing.

58
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,370
We both were amazing.

59
00:03:27,395 --> 00:03:28,727
That was so amazing.

60
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,815
What is all this stuff?

61
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,611
Just gifts from my fans.

62
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:37,564
Chocolate, stuffed animals.
I don't know.

63
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:38,839
Underwear.

64
00:03:44,053 --> 00:03:45,934
Some of this stuff
is from the L.A. show.

65
00:03:46,281 --> 00:03:47,281
Really?

66
00:03:52,813 --> 00:03:55,652
This is not exactly my style.

67
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,464
I think it's sweet.

68
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,739
You keep it.

69
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:01,409
Really?

70
00:04:01,779 --> 00:04:03,202
It's my gift to you.

71
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,211
Can you help me put it on?

72
00:04:15,478 --> 00:04:16,498
What's up?

73
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:18,319
You want to walk me to class?

74
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:19,486
Sure.

75
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:23,360
Want to go to this party thing?

76
00:04:23,527 --> 00:04:25,436
What, that thing?
What is this?

77
00:04:25,603 --> 00:04:27,418
Actually, it's like a tradition.

78
00:04:27,585 --> 00:04:30,478
It's like the senior class passing
the torch down to the junior class.

79
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:33,928
The guys wear tuxes.
The junior girls wear red.

80
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:35,536
Senior girls wear white.

81
00:04:35,703 --> 00:04:38,039
Food, dancing.
Should be fun.

82
00:04:38,206 --> 00:04:41,080
Right, because school-sanctioned
dancing sounds like a real hoot.

83
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:44,061
Get down.
You know you have a bad attitude.

84
00:04:44,228 --> 00:04:47,040
I forgot to tell you.
The water in Australia

85
00:04:47,207 --> 00:04:49,873
goes
down the drain counterclockwise.

86
00:04:50,893 --> 00:04:52,458
I'm sorry. I think that's rad.

87
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,545
- What?
- We're going to Australia.

88
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,112
I know. I'm so stoked.

89
00:04:58,738 --> 00:05:01,676
And, I got to tell you, I'm so glad
we got over that stupid fight thing.

90
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:06,575
I learned my lesson, as long as we're
honest with each other, it's all good.

91
00:05:10,262 --> 00:05:11,639
Totally.
Come on.

92
00:05:16,962 --> 00:05:17,962
Let's go.

S02E22 <i>Confessions</i>

95
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:12,968
We all know the
universe is expanding,

96
00:06:13,494 --> 00:06:15,306
but is it slowing down,

97
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:17,421
or is it accelerating?

98
00:06:18,802 --> 00:06:20,088
I want you to partner up

99
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,898
and start plotting the
supernovae redshift data.

100
00:06:23,065 --> 00:06:26,696
And maybe we'll figure out what's
going on with this universe of ours.

101
00:06:28,111 --> 00:06:30,729
Dude, Mr. Reiss is so high.

102
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:34,727
It's like his mind supernova-ed from
thinking about the universe too much.

103
00:06:40,073 --> 00:06:42,110
I have something I have to tell you.

104
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,988
I can't not tell you.

105
00:06:46,227 --> 00:06:49,117
Remember that day
that we broke up at Adrianna's concert?

106
00:06:49,721 --> 00:06:51,703
What, for, like, two minutes?

107
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:00,420
I ended up kissing Silver.

108
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,357
We were both sad and-and drunk,

109
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,838
and I swear,
from the bottom of my heart,

110
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:09,002
it didn't mean anything.
All right?

111
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:11,205
I don't like her;
she doesn't like me;

112
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,889
but I can't keep a secret from you.

113
00:07:14,156 --> 00:07:15,585
I have to be honest.

114
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,986
You know what?

115
00:07:21,153 --> 00:07:22,777
Dixon, you know what?

116
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,736
Screw you.

117
00:07:25,454 --> 00:07:27,893
I don't need to play second
fiddle to another girl anymore.

118
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,950
- I've gone on that ride, I'm done.
- You're not playing second fiddle.

119
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:32,635
Yeah. Right.

120
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,636
"Known for his scathing
yet romantic depiction

121
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:40,626
of frivolous
upper-class Americans..."

122
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:45,181
"... F. Scott Fitzgerald
is considered unparalleled

123
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:47,995
in the elegance and
grace of his fiction."

124
00:07:49,195 --> 00:07:50,566
You recognize that?

125
00:07:51,398 --> 00:07:52,835
That's from my paper.

126
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:55,711
That is from a paper that Ms. Genlow

127
00:07:56,261 --> 00:07:59,489
pulled off a Web site called
Greatpapersforcheap.com.

128
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:00,987
I'm sorry. What?

129
00:08:01,154 --> 00:08:03,298
I don't think you know
what's going on here.

130
00:08:03,465 --> 00:08:06,819
With this infraction, you're going to
get an F in English, and with that,

131
00:08:07,468 --> 00:08:09,968
you're not going to
graduate this year.

132
00:08:11,328 --> 00:08:13,415
I don't think it's gonna be
that bad.

133
00:08:13,582 --> 00:08:15,454
I feel fairly confident

134
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:19,123
that you can talk to Ms. Genlow
and convince her to look the other way.

135
00:08:19,564 --> 00:08:22,001
- Why would I do that?
- Because otherwise,

136
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,266
I'll tell the superintendent
how you covered up the fact that

137
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:28,174
your son broke into the school
the night of the vandalism.

138
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:31,518
I'll do it, too.

139
00:08:40,793 --> 00:08:42,765
<i>Come on, people. Let's hustle!</i>

140
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,137
When is Obama
gonna outlaw gym class?

141
00:09:02,304 --> 00:09:05,065
Guantanamo Bay, yeah, that's great.
What about phys ed?

142
00:09:05,232 --> 00:09:06,768
Seriously.
Am I right?

143
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:11,509
What's going on?

144
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:13,830
Why haven't you returned my calls?

145
00:09:13,997 --> 00:09:15,793
- How are you feeling?
- Fine.

146
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:20,225
I mean, fine.
Considering I was pretty sick.

147
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:23,020
It wasn't the flu,
actually. It was food poisoning.

148
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,335
Serves me right for eating
the cafeteria sushi.

149
00:09:25,502 --> 00:09:27,316
Just stop.
Stop lying.

150
00:09:28,075 --> 00:09:30,530
You weren't sick.
I heard a car honking. You were driving,

151
00:09:30,697 --> 00:09:33,586
- you pretended you were in bed.
- The sushi thing happened afterwards,

152
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:35,799
- and I wasn't in bed per Se.
- You know what?

153
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:37,793
It's over.

154
00:09:38,282 --> 00:09:40,836
I don't want to be with you anymore.

155
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,397
We never had much in common;
you're self-centered;

156
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:45,626
and you lied to me too many times.

157
00:09:46,157 --> 00:09:47,587
I forgave the Cannon thing,

158
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,761
but I just needed to talk to you,

159
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:52,508
and you pretended you had the flu.

160
00:09:54,062 --> 00:09:55,678
It's just too much. I'm done.

161
00:09:58,036 --> 00:09:59,571
Like you're so perfect.

162
00:09:59,738 --> 00:10:02,134
Like you always do the right thing.

163
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:04,604
I don't.

164
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:08,142
But this... you and me...

165
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:09,913
we're done.

166
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:23,101
So your singing career has really
taken off, hasn't it, Adrianna?

167
00:10:23,268 --> 00:10:24,617
It's been amazing.

168
00:10:24,944 --> 00:10:27,644
I was recently signed by Laurel
Cooper at Witgate Records,

169
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:29,553
and it's been so great.

170
00:10:30,219 --> 00:10:31,431
Word has it

171
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:34,361
that you just did a duet
in New York with Javier.

172
00:10:34,953 --> 00:10:36,719
Yes, I did. It was crazy.

173
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,433
And I think that all of West Bev

174
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,095
is extremely proud of
your accomplishments.

175
00:10:45,262 --> 00:10:48,028
So, you and Javier are dating.
Am I right?

176
00:10:48,388 --> 00:10:51,359
Tell us what's it like to date
someone so famous and successful.

177
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:52,985
It's been good.

178
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:56,220
He's a really sweet guy. We've just
started to get to know each other,

179
00:10:56,387 --> 00:10:57,573
- but...
- Cut.

180
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,961
I'm sorry.
We need to cut.

181
00:11:00,313 --> 00:11:02,808
This is The Blaze: Live Edition, Navid.
We can't cut.

182
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:05,164
We can if I say it.
And the lighting looks weird.

183
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,743
And I want to discuss wardrobe and

184
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:10,169
I need to talk
to Adrianna right now.

185
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,555
Can you just please go?

186
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,593
Navid, what's going on?

187
00:11:20,207 --> 00:11:23,599
Can I ask you a couple of
my own personal questions?

188
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,558
Like, for instance,

189
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,980
- where did you get that bracelet?
- It was a gift from Javier.

190
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,462
From Javier?

191
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,046
Javier gave me this bracelet. What?

192
00:11:33,548 --> 00:11:36,195
So Javier happens to know
that your favorite flower is tulips.

193
00:11:37,455 --> 00:11:40,195
And Javier also knows
that you love butterflies

194
00:11:40,362 --> 00:11:42,847
and that your favorite
food is hamburgers, right?

195
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:44,595
And there- the 11 and the six.

196
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:48,207
Javier also coincidentally put those on
there because he knows the first time

197
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,793
- you and I kissed was on November 6.
- November 6.

198
00:11:53,488 --> 00:11:54,672
This is from you?

199
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,660
So much for The Blaze: Live Edition.

200
00:11:59,188 --> 00:12:00,684
What's going on?

201
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,194
Looks to me
like it's The Blaze: Live Edition.

202
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:06,392
<i>You can date Javier.</i>

203
00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:09,186
<i>You can fall deeply
in love with him.</i>

204
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:11,684
<i>You can marry
him and have a whole brood</i>

205
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:14,101
of Javier Juniors with amazing abs.

206
00:12:14,396 --> 00:12:17,208
You can do that for the rest
of your entire life.

207
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:20,975
You can do all that.
But you can't do it wearing my bracelet.

208
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,433
- Who didn't turn off their camera?
- Not I.

209
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,162
My bad.
Navid yells, I panic.

210
00:12:26,623 --> 00:12:28,164
<i>Give it back, Ade.</i>

211
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,843
<i>Can you give it back?</i>

212
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,416
<i>Give me back my bracelet.</i>

213
00:12:32,397 --> 00:12:34,303
I don't want to give it back, Navid.

214
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:36,839
Leave us alone.

215
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,342
- What do you mean?
- I don't want to give it back.

216
00:12:40,415 --> 00:12:42,345
I didn't think you liked me,
all right?

217
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,878
<i>I know I am a lot of drama,
and I just didn't think</i>

218
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:48,506
- <i>that you liked me.</i>
- <i>I do.</i>

219
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:51,812
<i>I like you.</i>

220
00:12:52,802 --> 00:12:56,150
<i>But I know you're dating Javier,
and he's famous and sexy</i>

221
00:12:56,602 --> 00:12:57,860
<i>and famous and...</i>

222
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,736
<i>I'm just Navid.</i>

223
00:13:02,117 --> 00:13:03,908
I can't begin to compete with that.

224
00:13:06,448 --> 00:13:08,371
<i>That's where you're wrong, Navid.</i>

225
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:12,817
No one can compete with you.

226
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,799
I'm so happy for them.

227
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,300
You okay?

228
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:34,747
No, not at all.

229
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:37,982
Liam just broke up with me.

230
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:40,678
Sweetie, come here.

231
00:13:57,658 --> 00:14:00,423
The surface of this creme brulee,
it isn't hard enough.

232
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:02,476
Creme brulee,

233
00:14:02,963 --> 00:14:05,594
it's like a woman.
It should seem impenetrable

234
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:08,110
and then tap, tap...

235
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,000
and you're in.

236
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:13,936
Comprende?

237
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,478
Can I talk to you?

238
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,278
Tio, thank you.

239
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:25,281
Is it true?

240
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,992
Are you pregnant with my kid?

241
00:14:30,723 --> 00:14:32,273
Who... told you that?

242
00:14:32,826 --> 00:14:35,024
I saw a paternity test.

243
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,794
How did you even...?
How did you get my DNA?

244
00:14:41,182 --> 00:14:43,817
You left your gnarly
hairbrush at my house.

245
00:14:44,815 --> 00:14:46,120
My God.

246
00:14:47,301 --> 00:14:48,578
So it's true.

247
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:53,309
I'm gonna be a father.

248
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,404
You know what?
I'm not going to mess this up.

249
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,005
I'm going to get my
life back on track.

250
00:15:09,172 --> 00:15:11,358
I want to be there for my kid.

251
00:15:12,064 --> 00:15:13,064
I do.

252
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:15,860
I don't make a lot of money,
but I have some savings,

253
00:15:16,027 --> 00:15:19,247
and the good thing about my job
is I get summers off, and...

254
00:15:20,364 --> 00:15:21,995
Basically, Jen,

255
00:15:22,415 --> 00:15:24,736
I want to do whatever I can

256
00:15:26,118 --> 00:15:27,827
to help raise this baby.

257
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:31,360
Our baby.

258
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:34,642
I don't need your help.

259
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,139
Thank you very much.

260
00:15:36,306 --> 00:15:38,729
I'll he nannies and baby
nurses for that kind of thing.

261
00:15:40,915 --> 00:15:43,567
But this is my baby too, Jen.
I have rights.

262
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,117
Which I will fight you for in court.

263
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,556
Just give up, Ryan.

264
00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:53,035
My baby doesn't need a public
schoolteacher as a father.

265
00:15:54,414 --> 00:15:55,414
Wait.

266
00:15:58,539 --> 00:16:01,385
If you will excuse me,
I have a prenatal yoga class.

267
00:16:05,219 --> 00:16:06,468
What's going on?

268
00:16:06,888 --> 00:16:08,425
You owe me an explanation.

269
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:10,849
He came over

270
00:16:11,581 --> 00:16:12,630
your dad.

271
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,435
He offered me money
to break up with you.

272
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,313
$150,000.

273
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:26,414
I hate him!

274
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:28,636
He thinks just cause he has money,

275
00:16:28,803 --> 00:16:32,519
and he's Spence friggin' Montgomery,
that he can do whatever he wants.

276
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,113
He's a jerk!

277
00:16:35,186 --> 00:16:36,463
Yeah, he's a jerk.

278
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,420
I'm sorry.

279
00:16:46,018 --> 00:16:49,091
If you didn't take the money,
then why did you break up with me?

280
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,929
Cause your dad's a jerk,
but he's also right.

281
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:57,200
I was getting in the way
of your tennis career.

282
00:16:57,367 --> 00:16:59,047
I care about you too much

283
00:16:59,214 --> 00:17:01,690
to be the one to stand in
the way of that. I'm not going to.

284
00:17:01,857 --> 00:17:04,600
If you care about me so much,
then why won't you listen to me?

285
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,922
I don't want you in my life.
I need you

286
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:08,574
in my life.

287
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:13,995
And I can do both. I can have
tennis and a relationship with you.

288
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,770
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:27,004
It's over.

290
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,634
- I'm ready to leave.
- No. Shut up.

291
00:18:17,801 --> 00:18:21,567
Just because we are single does not
mean we can't have a fabulous time.

292
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:24,861
All the single ladies,
all the single ladies

293
00:18:27,115 --> 00:18:29,441
Put your hands up, up in the air...

294
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,946
I don't think being single
is what's holding me back.

295
00:18:32,113 --> 00:18:33,531
- What is?
- I don't know

296
00:18:33,698 --> 00:18:36,055
being in a horrifically crappy mood.

297
00:18:36,222 --> 00:18:38,479
I don't get it. How come
you're not in a crappy mood?

298
00:18:38,646 --> 00:18:40,805
Because Liam is a loser.

299
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:44,148
And I'm fantastic. And I'm going to
meet someone a thousand times better.

300
00:18:44,315 --> 00:18:46,731
We just have to keep our chins
up so people don't pity us,

301
00:18:46,898 --> 00:18:50,604
and as a bonus, we won't get that whole
pelican neck thing in our photos.

302
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:53,562
Come on.? All the single ladies,
all the single ladies...?

303
00:18:53,729 --> 00:18:55,565
Come on, sing with me, Silver.

304
00:18:55,732 --> 00:18:58,053
What? What are you staring at?

305
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,793
Can I ask you a question?

306
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,819
Why did you break up with him?

307
00:19:05,986 --> 00:19:07,020
You know why.

308
00:19:07,556 --> 00:19:09,109
I just want what's best for him.

309
00:19:09,528 --> 00:19:11,717
And how do you
know what's best for Teddy?

310
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,626
Isn't that the same patronizing
attitude his father has?

311
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:17,528
Shouldn't Teddy get a chance
to make decisions for himself?

312
00:19:27,497 --> 00:19:28,697
There you are.

313
00:19:32,064 --> 00:19:35,264
- I have something to tell you.
- No, wait. Me first.

314
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:38,343
I want you to open for me on tour.

315
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:40,539
What?

316
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,843
It'll be a huge opportunity for you.

317
00:19:43,293 --> 00:19:46,093
- And we'll get to travel together...
- Stop.

318
00:19:47,349 --> 00:19:49,313
I got back together with Navid.

319
00:19:51,854 --> 00:19:53,400
- Why?
- I love him.

320
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,119
I'm so sorry, Javier.

321
00:20:05,475 --> 00:20:07,998
Hey, getting ready to
sing for these lucky kids?

322
00:20:10,717 --> 00:20:11,867
What's wrong?

323
00:20:12,741 --> 00:20:14,791
Adrianna just broke up with me.

324
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,591
But it's not over till it's over.

325
00:20:27,332 --> 00:20:29,370
There you are.
You're dressed up.

326
00:20:29,537 --> 00:20:32,234
I was getting ready for the party
when I got your text.

327
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:34,404
But it's cool. I got time.
What's up?

328
00:20:35,713 --> 00:20:38,463
I came clean. I told my mom
that I stole the coins.

329
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,643
You did?

330
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,651
And when my step-dad gets back
from Miami, I'm going to tell him, too.

331
00:20:42,818 --> 00:20:45,654
At which point, my life will
essentially be over, but...

332
00:20:46,976 --> 00:20:48,865
No, which brings me to my point...

333
00:20:49,258 --> 00:20:50,358
and my text.

334
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,678
I'm so glad you made it
because I really wanted you...

335
00:20:53,845 --> 00:20:56,283
- I wanted you here for this.
- For what?

336
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,750
What's going on?

337
00:20:58,886 --> 00:21:00,115
Take a look.

338
00:21:03,285 --> 00:21:05,472
My gosh.
Liam, it's your boat!

339
00:21:06,448 --> 00:21:08,892
- It's on the water! I mean...
- It floats.

340
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,142
I know.

341
00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:11,759
It's amazing, Liam.

342
00:21:12,464 --> 00:21:13,987
So does it work?

343
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,276
- I mean, does it sail?
- Let's find out.

344
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:19,541
Okay.

345
00:21:26,903 --> 00:21:28,853
I can't believe you did this.

346
00:22:11,077 --> 00:22:12,670
Man, I'm gonna get out of here.

347
00:22:12,837 --> 00:22:14,249
<i>Sorry for the interruption.</i>

348
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,063
<i>Would Ivy Sullivan please report
to the planetarium?</i>

349
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,667
<i>Ivy Sullivan to the
planetarium, please.</i>

350
00:22:27,176 --> 00:22:28,176
Hello?

351
00:22:35,715 --> 00:22:36,715
Hello?

352
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:41,622
Early astronomers believed
in the geocentric theory...

353
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:44,497
that the earth was the
center of the universe...

354
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,074
but in the 16th century,

355
00:22:48,287 --> 00:22:51,634
Copernicus presented evidence
for the heliocentric theory...

356
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:54,944
that the sun was the
center of the universe...

357
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,401
but recently,

358
00:22:57,568 --> 00:23:00,253
Dixon Wilson has come up
with a new understanding

359
00:23:00,503 --> 00:23:02,881
of our universe, he calls...

360
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,732
Ivy-centric.

361
00:23:14,122 --> 00:23:15,372
You're it, Ivy.

362
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:18,897
You're the only girl
in this world for me.

363
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,097
You're the center of my universe.

364
00:23:25,764 --> 00:23:27,164
Please forgive me.

365
00:23:27,952 --> 00:23:29,702
God, you're crazy, Dixon.

366
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,910
Crazy about you.

367
00:23:33,466 --> 00:23:35,080
And also a little crazy, you know.

368
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,272
Man, I've been working on this nonstop
ever since we fought.

369
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,379
Turns out Mr. Reiss has some
connections here, so...

370
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:45,401
if you don't take me back,

371
00:23:45,568 --> 00:23:48,135
hopefully I'll at least
get a little extra credit.

372
00:23:50,538 --> 00:23:51,988
So what do you say?

373
00:23:59,341 --> 00:24:00,147
Okay.

374
00:24:00,486 --> 00:24:01,565
Okay, what?

375
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,815
Okay...

376
00:24:04,304 --> 00:24:06,361
I would really like
to be back with you.

377
00:24:08,123 --> 00:24:11,597
And it'd be nice
if you'd still come to Australia

378
00:24:12,176 --> 00:24:13,910
cause I'd really like you to.

379
00:24:14,438 --> 00:24:16,562
- For real?
- Yes, for real.

380
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:18,623
Better get home and
get your bags packed.

381
00:24:18,873 --> 00:24:20,223
We leave tonight.

382
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:50,539
Go.

383
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,402
Go already, go!

384
00:24:55,939 --> 00:24:57,089
And have fun.

385
00:25:04,964 --> 00:25:06,064
I was wrong.

386
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,674
I love you and I want
to listen to you, and...

387
00:25:10,124 --> 00:25:13,070
if you think that you can
play tennis and be with me,

388
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:16,301
then it's your decision.

389
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:28,165
- You want to dance with me?
- Sure. All right. Yes

390
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,767
Howdy, Laurel and Hardy.

391
00:25:52,404 --> 00:25:53,920
How are we?

392
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:57,139
- You're in a good mood.
- Not really.

393
00:25:58,172 --> 00:26:01,260
Actually, feeling more
like a piece of trash

394
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,230
cause I was excited to be a father,

395
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,481
you know,

396
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,310
not just a father figure but, like,

397
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,528
- a father.
- You're wasted.

398
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,155
No, what's the matter?

399
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,365
I thought you were down
with the fun, baby.

400
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,503
Ryan, you need to go home.

401
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:19,911
You need to go home
and you need to sleep this off.

402
00:26:20,735 --> 00:26:21,735
Go home.

403
00:26:38,793 --> 00:26:40,640
The West Beverly Hills High School

404
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,768
class of 2010 hereby passes

405
00:26:44,018 --> 00:26:46,730
the torch to the class of 2011.

406
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:09,044
Ladies and gentlemen,
the class of 2011.

407
00:27:46,423 --> 00:27:48,703
I need to get back to the school.

408
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:52,448
I can't believe they made us
take shuttles. Ridiculous.

409
00:27:52,677 --> 00:27:54,177
You just missed one.

410
00:27:55,766 --> 00:27:57,968
So drive me now.

411
00:27:59,456 --> 00:28:01,656
Next shuttle leaves in 15 minutes.

412
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,460
15 minutes?

413
00:28:22,771 --> 00:28:25,370
- I'm sorry you missed the party.
- I'm not.

414
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:27,539
How come you didn't name the boat?

415
00:28:28,298 --> 00:28:31,298
I thought I knew what I
wanted to call it, but...

416
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,010
I changed my mind, so...

417
00:28:34,784 --> 00:28:37,223
I guess the future
is still unwritten.

418
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,683
What are you thinking?

419
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,308
I can't believe that you're going to
tell your stepfather the truth.

420
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:48,567
It's going to be rough.

421
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,130
So why?

422
00:28:54,097 --> 00:28:56,497
I made a lot of
mistakes in the past.

423
00:28:56,664 --> 00:28:58,880
I've done drugs, I've been violent.

424
00:28:59,624 --> 00:29:02,562
I didn't tell people the truth
about what happened with Jen.

425
00:29:03,943 --> 00:29:06,053
I'm really sorry about that, I...

426
00:29:07,483 --> 00:29:08,997
But this year has changed me.

427
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,959
I became someone who really
wants to do the right thing.

428
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:16,598
So yeah, it's going to be tough
when I confess, but if I didn't,

429
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:20,472
I don't know what
that would do to me.

430
00:29:22,091 --> 00:29:24,941
I don't think I'd be
able to live with myself.

431
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,233
Yeah, well, you're a
better person than I am.

432
00:29:33,765 --> 00:29:36,107
You would do the same thing
if you were in my position.

433
00:29:37,488 --> 00:29:41,293
No, actually, I've done far worse

434
00:29:41,878 --> 00:29:43,628
and I haven't come clean.

435
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:55,387
I was the one

436
00:29:57,169 --> 00:29:58,505
who killed Joe Herman.

437
00:29:59,203 --> 00:30:02,178
Naomi had that prom
after party last year,

438
00:30:02,345 --> 00:30:03,760
and I was really upset

439
00:30:04,538 --> 00:30:05,538
and drunk.

440
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:08,706
And I drove like that.

441
00:30:09,194 --> 00:30:11,226
I was coming down Mulholland

442
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,026
when I hit something,

443
00:30:13,293 --> 00:30:14,604
and I just panicked.

444
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,004
I didn't even get out of the car.

445
00:30:17,405 --> 00:30:19,734
I couldn't get out of the car.

446
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,060
I just drove home

447
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:25,715
and secretly got the car
fixed the next morning,

448
00:30:26,416 --> 00:30:29,411
and I hoped that, you know,
it was a coyote or something.

449
00:30:31,428 --> 00:30:32,628
But it wasn't.

450
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,843
I found out online that I had hit

451
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,480
a person.

452
00:30:40,627 --> 00:30:41,627
A man.

453
00:30:43,766 --> 00:30:45,640
And he was in a coma

454
00:30:46,934 --> 00:30:48,430
and then he died.

455
00:30:50,797 --> 00:30:52,246
And his name...

456
00:30:53,093 --> 00:30:54,893
his name was Joe Herman...

457
00:30:56,196 --> 00:30:58,450
and he was a... a human being

458
00:30:59,887 --> 00:31:01,237
and I killed him.

459
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,532
What are you doing?

460
00:31:59,923 --> 00:32:00,923
Packing.

461
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:05,507
Why are you staring like that?

462
00:32:05,952 --> 00:32:08,051
What makes you think
you're going to Australia?

463
00:32:09,006 --> 00:32:10,536
Nobody said I couldn't.

464
00:32:10,703 --> 00:32:12,307
Then let me be clear...

465
00:32:13,168 --> 00:32:14,525
- you can't.
- What?!

466
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:18,978
When I said yes, I had no idea
the trouble that you'd gotten into.

467
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,333
I've been planning
this for, for ages.

468
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,871
I already promised Ivy.

469
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,568
Look, this is an opportunity
for me to go to Australia.

470
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,262
- Please.
- No.

471
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:32,507
What, I'm supposed to stick around here
all summer, listen to you and Dad fight?

472
00:32:34,367 --> 00:32:36,317
The decision is final, Dixon.

473
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:48,039
Where were you?

474
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,916
I had a meeting with
the superintendent.

475
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:53,270
At this time of night?
What were you doing?

476
00:32:53,677 --> 00:32:54,591
Getting fired.

477
00:32:55,337 --> 00:32:57,859
- What?!
- Some kid in the senior class

478
00:32:58,026 --> 00:33:00,395
tried to blackmail me
for trying to protect Dixon.

479
00:33:00,801 --> 00:33:02,855
And I had to go to to Ms. Angus

480
00:33:03,105 --> 00:33:05,792
and tell her the truth;
it was the only thing to do.

481
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:08,653
And they let me go.

482
00:33:12,336 --> 00:33:14,325
Do you have anything
to say on the subject?

483
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:19,914
Maybe you shouldn't have lied.

484
00:33:24,506 --> 00:33:27,381
That's all you have to say...
maybe I shouldn't have lied?

485
00:33:27,548 --> 00:33:29,963
I lose my job... everything,
and all you can say is,

486
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,687
- maybe I shouldn't have lied?
- You want some words of wisdom

487
00:33:32,854 --> 00:33:34,846
from me? Some advice?
Well, it's too late.

488
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,932
Maybe you should've come to me
before you made our lives a total mess.

489
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,801
I made a total mess of our lives?

490
00:33:39,968 --> 00:33:42,729
I was doing what I thought was right!
I was protecting our son!

491
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,615
Who said that's what Dixon needed?!

492
00:33:44,782 --> 00:33:46,281
What about consequences?

493
00:33:46,448 --> 00:33:49,292
He needs to learn
that actions have consequences.

494
00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:52,131
And, yes, you,
you did make a mess of our lives.

495
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:54,678
- How can you say that?
- God... don't you get it, Harry?

496
00:33:54,845 --> 00:33:56,284
We don't have anything!

497
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,940
You don't have a job.
We don't have savings.

498
00:33:59,107 --> 00:34:01,507
And we don't love
each other anymore!

499
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,208
Is that true?

500
00:34:05,305 --> 00:34:07,754
- Is that true? You tell me.
- You tell me.

501
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,672
No, you tell me is that true!

502
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:13,384
You look me in the eye, and you tell me
if you're still in love with me.

503
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:24,678
Hey, you two.

504
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:29,513
Hey, Javier. What's up?

505
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:36,281
I just wanted to talk to you.
I know we're not together anymore but...

506
00:34:37,161 --> 00:34:38,868
I still think you're
incredibly talented.

507
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,710
- Yeah definitely...
- No, well,

508
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,916
the offer for you to go on
tour with me still stands.

509
00:34:45,386 --> 00:34:47,085
What? Really?

510
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,935
You're good, Adrianna.

511
00:34:51,064 --> 00:34:52,664
You should do it, Ade.

512
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:56,177
Yeah, it's a huge opportunity,
what better way to spend your summer?

513
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,046
- I can go with you.
- Really?

514
00:34:58,213 --> 00:35:00,363
Yeah, we could spend it together.

515
00:35:01,257 --> 00:35:03,434
My tour's not a summer tour.
It's a whole year.

516
00:35:05,943 --> 00:35:07,397
Well, I'm still in school.

517
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,232
And why do people go to school?

518
00:35:10,012 --> 00:35:13,111
To get the education they need
to get the job of their dreams.

519
00:35:13,513 --> 00:35:15,363
Adrianna, this is your dream,

520
00:35:16,459 --> 00:35:18,059
right here, right now.

521
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,835
I know it's not the safe move,
but come on.

522
00:35:21,851 --> 00:35:22,870
Take a risk.

523
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:27,069
Maybe.

524
00:35:33,035 --> 00:35:34,035
Hello?

525
00:35:36,389 --> 00:35:37,389
Hello?

526
00:35:45,206 --> 00:35:46,656
My car won't start.

527
00:35:47,633 --> 00:35:50,106
Who knew that could be a problem
in the modern era, right?

528
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,460
Apparently there are
cars that don't start.

529
00:35:52,782 --> 00:35:54,652
And my cell phone died, so I just,

530
00:35:55,213 --> 00:35:58,074
need to borrow someone's
phone to call AAA.

531
00:35:58,864 --> 00:36:01,951
- I didn't know it was you here, so...
- Is everything okay, Naomi?

532
00:36:09,038 --> 00:36:11,175
No, it's not.

533
00:36:20,215 --> 00:36:21,929
Everything is not okay.

534
00:36:24,385 --> 00:36:26,559
Everything is wrong.

535
00:36:27,932 --> 00:36:29,532
And it's all my fault.

536
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,651
Because I'm self-centered.

537
00:36:36,191 --> 00:36:37,945
I'm a liar.

538
00:36:38,408 --> 00:36:40,761
I'm a terrible person. No.

539
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:42,867
You're not a terrible person.

540
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:45,369
How can you say that?
I almost ruined your life.

541
00:36:45,733 --> 00:36:46,983
But you didn't.

542
00:36:51,868 --> 00:36:54,452
Would you like a glass of water?

543
00:36:55,753 --> 00:36:56,753
Yeah.

544
00:37:53,878 --> 00:37:56,087
Are you sure you don't
want me to go in with you?

545
00:37:56,254 --> 00:37:57,954
I have to do this alone.

546
00:37:59,535 --> 00:38:01,535
Well, I'm sleeping on my boat,

547
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:04,254
you know, to enjoy my
last night of freedom.

548
00:38:04,421 --> 00:38:07,198
I don't know if I'll get
cell reception out there, but

549
00:38:07,365 --> 00:38:09,704
if you need me,
you know where to find me.

550
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:10,954
Thank you.

551
00:38:39,102 --> 00:38:40,855
Mom, Dad,

552
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,169
I have something that
I have to tell you.

553
00:39:42,796 --> 00:39:44,618
<i>The animal kingdom is brutal.</i>

554
00:39:44,785 --> 00:39:47,635
<i>But no animal is as brutal
as the Homo sapien.</i>

555
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:53,683
Anyway, it goes on and
on and on like that.

556
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,933
Well, it's an amazing project.

557
00:39:57,554 --> 00:40:00,249
- I'm really impressed, seriously.
- I'm glad.

558
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:03,818
So... I'm not just some boring,
old bastard, then?

559
00:40:04,389 --> 00:40:06,428
Of course not. No.

560
00:40:06,929 --> 00:40:09,324
I mean, you're talented.

561
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,742
- Ah, you're just saying that.
- No.

562
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:12,994
Thank you.

563
00:40:14,186 --> 00:40:15,586
Means a lot to me.

564
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:24,088
It's seems like a very
important documentary.

565
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:26,222
Thank you.

566
00:40:27,403 --> 00:40:29,462
You don't mind me holding
your hand, do you?

567
00:40:29,834 --> 00:40:32,722
No, that's... no. It's fine.

568
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:37,935
I should probably call
AAA though, because...

569
00:40:40,269 --> 00:40:41,272
Come on.

570
00:40:42,326 --> 00:40:45,568
It's okay. I know you wanted me to kiss
you. You don't have to feel guilty.

571
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,779
What? I don't feel guilty.
I don't want you to kiss me.

572
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,281
Enough, Naomi.

573
00:40:51,387 --> 00:40:53,087
Enough with the teasing.

574
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:56,454
I see the way you look at me.
And your whole harassment fantasy?

575
00:40:56,924 --> 00:40:58,783
You're trying to provoke me.

576
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,551
And now that you have,
you're going to play the innocent?

577
00:41:01,718 --> 00:41:02,752
Don't bother.

578
00:41:03,853 --> 00:41:05,254
I know you want me to.

579
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,715
Get away from me, you perv.

580
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,222
- Stop it! Stop or I will tell. Stop!
- Who're you going to tell?

581
00:41:15,797 --> 00:41:17,547
Who're you going to tell?

582
00:41:20,803 --> 00:41:22,653
Who's going to believe you?

583
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,460
You're the girl who cried wolf.

584
