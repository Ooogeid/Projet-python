1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,370
previously on 90210...

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,900
I wanted to get something
permanent to symbolize our love.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,310
We just had sex in the media room.

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,670
You and me in the
storage room right now.

5
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,030
Being your friend?

6
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,480
I'm over it.

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,990
I already beat you to it.

8
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,270
Us getting together didn't
work out for either of us, okay?

9
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,780
But don't punish my sister.

10
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,740
West Beverly high doesn't revolve
around Kelly Taylor's love life.

11
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,120
If anybody should be
pissed here, it's me.

12
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,220
Brenda? Really?

13
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,520
I wanted to ask you something.

14
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,840
- Will you be my valentine?
- Yeah.

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,630
- I don't want to keep fighting.
- Me, neither.

16
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,970
Let's end this.

17
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,300
I want to show a film
as my presentation.

18
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,460
- I'm in it?
- Just you wait.

19
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,790
You filmed us having sex?

20
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,890
What's wrong with you?

21
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,690
I love you so much, Dixon.

22
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,710
Just stay away from me.

23
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,830
Silver did this?

24
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,220
Silver, what are you doing?

25
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,890
I want you to fix all of this.

26
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,660
Silver, listen.

27
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,410
okay.

28
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,440
- Silver, please.
- Don't you move.

29
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,800
- I'm not.
- We both know you tried to turn Dixon against me.

30
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,220
Okay. How can I fix things?

31
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,730
You can start by telling him the truth.

32
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,810
You can tell him how you were manipulating
him and feeding him lies about me.

33
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,330
Okay. No problem.

34
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,770
Do you want me to call him?

35
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,960
- Stop!
- Silver...Silver!

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,270
Calm down. It's okay. It's okay.

37
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,570
- Silver!
- Let go of me!

38
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,110
Okay. It's okay

39
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,320
Get off! Get off. Get off.

40
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,720
Silver, listen to me.

41
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,380
It was because of the movie.

42
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,910
He really hated the movie, didn't he?

43
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:50,100
I thought he would love
the movie, but he hated it.

44
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,360
I don't know Dixon  at all.

45
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,500
He was the one person
that I loved the most

46
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,690
and I don't know who he is.

47
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,060
I don't understand.

48
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,450
Come on. You don't have
to figure it all out now.

49
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,890
- Yes, I do.
- No. You don't.

50
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,540
You need to get some rest.

51
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,810
Listen, let's call Kelly. Okay?

52
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,070
Why are my hands bleeding?

53
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,440
I might get blood on your couch.

54
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,180
Okay, doesn't matter.

55
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,810
Let me get you a bandage. Okay?

56
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,650
Then we'll call Kelly.

57
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,160
Okay. Then we'll call Kelly.

58
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,720
Bandages... uh, bandages.

59
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,970
Yeah, I know that I have them in here.

60
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,270
Okay, got it.

61
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,110
Let's see that hand.

62
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,130
Silver?

63
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,580
I thought we were meant to be together.

64
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,300
But if you want to be alone...

65
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,340
then just go.

66
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,760
mom, can I call you back?

67
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,940
Is everything okay?

68
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,510
No, I'm not with her.

69
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,110
Why? What happened?

70
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,850
Is Dixon all right?

71
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,530
Yeah, no, I'm coming home now.

72
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,430
- Is everything okay?
- No!

73
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,930
I don't know. It's Silver.

74
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,040
I have to get home.

75
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,430
and I didn't drive.

76
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,240
I'll take you.

77
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,560
* I sit and hear
sentimental footsteps... *

78
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,940
You need to tell us exactly
what's been going on.

79
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,540
Don't leave anything out.

80
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,520
What? What do you mean, Silver
broke into your apartment?

81
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,100
I mean, I come home and
the window is smashed, okay?

82
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,480
- And Silver is there.
- No way.

83
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,760
She got a giant tattoo of your name?

84
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,090
- And you didn't think this was worth mentioning?
- I'm sorry.

85
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,120
Believe me, Kelly, all right?
Something is going on with her.

86
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,670
No, I would know.

87
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,960
Do you know about her movie?

88
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,190
What movie?

89
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,880
She kind of filmed us...

90
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,630
having sex.

91
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,800
I think I'm going to throw up.

92
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,030
I had no idea.

93
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,100
- You had sex?
- You made a movie of it?

94
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,130
Freaky.

95
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,450
Totally, totally freaky.

96
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,780
- What?
- Silver apparently made...

97
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,660
har-gow, flower scallion rolls...

98
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,870
And
lor-mai-gai.

99
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,300
- Don't eat the leaf.
- What?

100
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,720
- Don't eat the leaf.
- Got it. Thanks.

101
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,070
Uh, so Silver apparently what?

102
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,210
Um, hold up.

103
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,740
Can we get some sesame balls, too, please?

104
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,930
thanks.

105
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,540
Oh, it's Naomi. Hold on.

106
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,590
We have to talk.

107
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,530
Crazy night.

108
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,750
- I know, I heard.
- Heard what?

109
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,310
That Liam's a psychopath
and an awesome kisser?

110
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,470
- I was talking about Silver's movie, but wow.
- Wow what?

111
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,620
Liam is a total psychopath
and an awesome kisser.

112
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,070
What happened with Silver?

113
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,690
Apparently, she made a porno of herself

114
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,880
and showed it at some theater.

115
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,650
Naomi: What?

116
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,490
- Naomi?
- Um, no, Silver.

117
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,160
Why would she do that?

118
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,700
I don't know.

119
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,770
Unless...

120
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,770
- it's drugs.
- It's got to be drugs.

121
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,560
- No, no way. - I'm guessing
cocaine. - Maybe meth.

122
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,790
- PCP?
- Or LSD.

123
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,240
- Could be speed.
- Weed?

124
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,860
- Methadone, mescaline, amphetamine, ketamine...
- ecstasy.

125
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,370
Stimulants, sedatives...

126
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,930
no! Stop!

127
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,950
All right? She's not doing
drugs. I would know.

128
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,700
Why else would she
break into my apartment?

129
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,060
- Or set a fire?
- Or get a tattoo?

130
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,780
Why else would you film
yourself having sex?

131
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,240
Oh, well, to improve your moves, of course.

132
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,130
What? Athletes watch replays.

133
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,560
It's the same thing.

134
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,670
I don't know.

135
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,130
Sesame balls?

136
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,470
Is that your pet name for Navid?

137
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,000
I should call Dixon.

138
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,750
it's Kelly.

139
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,380
I'll take it.

140
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,730
- Hello?
- Nope, Dixon's not answering.

141
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,510
What did sesame balls say?

142
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,550
No, we don't know where she is.

143
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,550
- I'm worried.
- I'm scared.

144
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,770
We have to find her.

145
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,660
Before she hurts someone or herself.

146
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,840
Oh, God, what is happening?

150
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,410
We need to divide up.

151
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,130
Debbie and I will
check out the peach pit.

152
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,840
Dixon, I'm going to drop you off at home

153
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,780
- so you'll have access to another car.
- Got it.

154
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,250
Somebody should check out the school.

155
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,490
Annie, here are the keys.

156
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,060
Ethan, you go with her.

157
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,310
Uh, sounds good.

158
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,980
Kelly, you want to stay
here in case she comes back?

159
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,510
No, I have to do something.

160
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,160
Harry: Okay, well, at least
let somebody drive you.

161
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,480
- No prob.
- No, that's okay.

162
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,210
Let me be your chauffer.

163
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,100
Sammy. What about Sammy?

164
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,640
Adrianna and I can watch
him. It's no problem.

165
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,310
- Okay, good. He's upstairs, sleeping.
- Okay.

166
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,560
- We should go.
- All right.

167
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,720
Everybody stay in touch by cell phone.

168
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,070
- Really? Babysitting?
- Why not?

169
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,590
I think it would probably be safer for me to
be out searching drug infested neighborhoods.

170
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,850
You kidding me? Sam's
asleep. It will be cake.

171
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,460
oh, loud, screaming cake.

172
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,740
I checked around back, too.

173
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,960
There's no sign of her.

174
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,330
You okay?

175
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,170
Harry, Dixon had sex.

176
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,080
Yes. He did.

177
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,680
That...he did.

178
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,720
And we had no clue.

179
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,980
Which is normal.

180
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,570
Teenage boys don't run and tell
their parents when they've had sex,

181
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,700
and if they do, well, they're peculiar.

182
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,980
I guess.

183
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,820
Look, sweetheart, a lot of
what's going on is not normal,

184
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,360
but Dixon not telling us is. Trust me.

185
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,580
Think. Where would she go?

186
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,670
I am thinking.

187
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,030
It still doesn't make sense to me
why she would go to your apartment.

188
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,690
It doesn't make sense because
Silver wasn't making sense.

189
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,860
Okay, you know, sensible
was not the overall tone

190
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,270
of that particular interchange.

191
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,730
Yeah, but there's got to be
some reason that she blames you.

192
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,180
I'm telling you I didn't do anything.

193
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,710
That you know of.

194
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,060
Some people aren't aware
of how they hurt people.

195
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,650
Aren't aware or don't care.

196
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,150
Your sister breaks into
my apartment, threatens me,

197
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,640
throws a wine bottle at my
head, and you're blaming me?

198
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,280
You are the one who left her alone.

199
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,630
You are the reason we are out
here looking for her right now.

200
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,430
She lives with you, Kelly, not me, okay?

201
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,270
You're the one who's supposed
to be taking care of her.

202
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,380
- Maybe we should check the pier.
- Yeah, fine.

203
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,310
Is he asleep?

204
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,100
Eyes closed, drool flowing.

205
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,740
you're like the baby whisperer.

206
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,140
What can I say?

207
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,010
I'm impressed.

208
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,210
I do not understand baby.

209
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,710
I do not speak baby.

210
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,350
I don't know from baby.

211
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,800
Well, lesson number one?

212
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,420
Sammy's not a baby, okay?

213
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,100
He's four.

214
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,920
exhibit A.

215
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,630
It's not my forte.

216
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,370
I'll incubate the little
thing and after that,

217
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:01,190
I think it's probably best that
I pass on the baton, you know?

218
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,920
Pass baton?

219
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,310
You mean...adoption?

220
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,610
Yeah, I'm leaning towards it...

221
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,600
pretty strongly.

222
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,430
Pretty much horizontal
toward adoption, yep.

223
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,980
- What?
- I was just...

224
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,120
oh, nothing. It's just...
 
225
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,940
we never really talk
about this stuff, do we?

225
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,950
About the pregnancy, I mean.

226
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,790
Well, it's not like it's your baby.

227
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,120
There's no reason you
have to deal with this.

228
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,240
So, adoption, huh?

229
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,730
That's the plan?

230
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,100
I don't know what else I should do.

231
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,620
I mean, you saw me with Sammy.

232
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,990
We will not grow old
when he started crying...

233
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,420
I was even more scared than he was.

234
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,750
- Silver?
- Dixon?

235
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,190
Dixon, I just, I just had to call
you because I want you to know

236
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,340
that I know that I don't know you,

237
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,310
and so I'm going back to the source.

238
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,770
The source of everything.

239
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,200
- What?
- You're all that I have.

240
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,350
The only thing that I...

241
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,440
the only thing that matters to me.

242
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,380
You're all that I need.

243
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,830
Without you, life isn't worth living.

244
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:59,960
Dixon? Dixon? Dixon?

245
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,820
DiX...?

246
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,340
- Dixon?
- In here.

247
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,420
We've been trying to reach you.

248
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,710
Yeah, I turned my phone off.

249
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:19,470
- Why did you turn your phone off?
- Silver called.

250
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,670
- What?!
- Where is she?

251
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,150
Who knows? Who cares?

252
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,180
She's a manipulative drama queen.

253
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,160
I'm not buying her crap anymore.

254
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,920
- Hey, Dixon...
- damn it.

255
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,570
What did Silver say?

256
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,810
Um, who knows?

257
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,840
When she called, she was so hysterical,

258
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,280
I could barely understand her.

259
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,670
She was just ranting on and on

260
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,330
about how all she has is me

261
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,800
and how life isn't
worth living without me.

262
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,390
So she's going back to the source.

263
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,930
What's the source?

264
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,830
Beats me.

265
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,340
Silver's a freak.

266
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,970
I got better things to worry about.

267
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,030
We should call the police.

268
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,580
I love you.

269
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,340
One shade the more, one ray the less...

270
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,430
- it's Silver.
- Come on.

271
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,790
which waves in every raven tress.

272
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,550
I love you.

273
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,580
One shade the more, one ray the less...

274
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,420
God!

275
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,930
What are you doing here?

276
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,370
Looking for Silver. I
was in the parking lot.

277
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,250
Ade told me she went AWOL.

278
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,410
Heard about her little movie,

279
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:27,050
so I figured it'd shed
some light on the subject.

280
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,480
Gotta say it's pretty creepy stuff.

281
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,710
A little arty for my taste.

282
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,570
Not exactly a sunset five kind of girl.

283
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,450
How did you get in?

284
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,150
We have my dad's keys.

285
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,780
Well, if you dress a little more like me,

286
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,080
the janitor opening the door
for you is only the beginning.

287
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,110
Although I don't know if it'd help.

288
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,170
I mean, you'd still be
stuck with that face.

289
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,850
Have you checked the whole school?

290
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,540
No, this is the first place I came.

291
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,220
Do you think she's okay?

292
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,910
Please, don't pretend to be concerned.

293
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,380
You guys are not friends.

294
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,920
For you information, we've been
hanging out quite a bit lately.

295
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,410
Oh, since when?

296
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,940
Nice valentine’s.

297
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,780
- It's really none of your...
- stop it!

298
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,880
Focus on Silver.

299
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,980
Look, the school's really
big. She could be anywhere.

300
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,660
- Well, then we should probably split up.
- Are you sure?

301
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,950
I mean, it gets kind creepy
around here at night.

302
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,800
Oh, that's really sweet, E.

303
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,110
Couldn't be any
creepier than hanging out

304
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:19,850
with my ex and his little girlfriend.

305
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,600
- Actually, we...
- know,

306
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,770
know that Silver's not in the east wing.

307
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,340
We already checked, FYI.

308
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,690
Right. Fine.

309
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,390
I'll check the auditorium.

310
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,610
I-I'm sorry about that.

311
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,910
I guess the thought of Naomi
finding out we broke up...

312
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,660
yeah, whatever. It's fine.

313
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:45,050
- I'm gonna go check the cafeteria.
- Cool.

314
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,040
Okay, the source. What
are we talking about here?

315
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,610
A water source or, uh, the power source,

316
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,920
uh... she said life isn't
worth living without him?

317
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,730
Don't go there, okay?

318
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,780
What kind of source? I mean, a fuel
source, a source of information,

319
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:59,270
a news source, the
hip-hop awards show, maybe.

320
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,990
Or the source of her pain.

321
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,540
Okay, sure, what's, what's, the
source of her pain?

322
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,080
Kelly, what a surprise.

323
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,680
- Is Silver here?
- Silver? No.

324
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,210
Mom, we have to talk.

325
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,090
- Dierk doesn't know I have kids.
- Dierk?

326
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,780
Hey, nice to meet you.

327
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,260
Nice to meet you, too, Dierk.

328
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,480
Kelly is my niece.

329
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,480
My older sister's daughter.

330
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,800
And this is Kelly's boy toy.

331
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,500
Uh, what did you say your name was?

332
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,400
Ryan. And he's my colleague.

333
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,670
Colleague, sure.

334
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,810
Do you two enjoy working together?

335
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,570
- Yeah, yeah
- uh, Silver is missing.

336
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,570
I wouldn't worry.

337
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,840
She is probably out partying somewhere

338
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,220
or slutting it up with some guy.

339
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,010
That's what Kelly always did.

340
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,830
I think Silver is in
trouble, real trouble.

341
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,900
So if she shows up here, I
want you to call me right away.

342
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,600
do you think this is funny?

343
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,640
Yeah, I do actually, because
you pranced in here,

344
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,480
all holier than thou, talking
about how bad a aunt I was,

345
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,270
and that you could do a
better job with Silver.

346
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,880
Well it looks like you
are no different than me.

347
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,510
And at least when she lived
here, I knew where she was.

348
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,280
Okay, we'd better go.

349
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,980
Uh, you'll call if you hear anything?

350
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,680
Yeah, you got it, boy toy.

351
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,270
Bye, mom.

352
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:30,190
Actually, I have a kid, too, which
makes her a grandma.

353
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,350
oh, that woman!

354
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,010
Every time I think she can't get
any worse, she gets so much worse.

355
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,300
- hello.
- Is this Kelly Taylor?

356
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,770
Yes, this is Kelly Taylor
this is officer Lewis, ma'am.

357
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:52,120
We found your sister's car
abandoned in a parking lot downtown.

358
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,180
No sign of your sister.

359
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,120
if Silver's not in her
car, then where is she?

360
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,110
I can't believe this. She's gone.

361
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,820
I-I did this. I... I don't know.

362
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,180
I tried. I mean, maybe I
gave her too much freedom,

363
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,850
but I had breakfast
with her every morning

364
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:14,810
and I checked to make sure
she was doing her homework.

365
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,610
I've just been too focused on
myself and my work and Sammy.

366
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:19,660
Kelly, no, okay?

367
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,760
- You can't blame yourself.
- Why not? You did.

368
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,790
You said it yourself.

369
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,990
I'm the one that lives with her.

370
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,550
I should have been taking care of her.

371
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,050
Oh, my God, I can't believe this!

372
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,960
After everything I've been
through with my mother,

373
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,280
here I am just like her!

374
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,470
No, no, are you kidding?

375
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,640
You and that woman,

376
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,710
you're night and day, okay?

377
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,310
You're Tolstoy and Dean Koontz.

378
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,950
You're Baryshnikov
and, and Michael Flatley.

379
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,500
I kind of like Michael Flatley,

380
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,060
but what I'm trying to say, Kelly,

381
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,600
is that you are not your
mother, okay? You are kind

382
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,440
Okay, you know what?

383
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,280
If this is you trying to comfort me,

384
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,590
just don't, all right?

385
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,850
Because you have done
nothing but try to avoid me

386
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,160
since you came back to school,

387
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,060
so you're not here tonight as my friend.

388
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,620
You're my chauffeur, that's it.

389
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,470
- Debbie: Dixon!
- What? I'm busy.

390
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,590
Harry: We want to let you
know they found Silver's car.

391
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,450
It was abandoned downtown.

392
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,300
Yeah? Well, big deal.

393
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,420
Let me know when you find a body.

394
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,820
Dixon!

395
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,510
What? I told you she's playing you.

396
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,010
And I'm not falling for it.

397
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,000
Now can you leave me alone?!

398
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,180
You're blocking my view.

399
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,960
Excuse me?

400
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,720
Last train to San Bernardino.

401
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,340
Train 416 departing platform A.

402
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,670
Yes! Kansas.

403
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:41,000
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

404
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,150
What's in Kansas?

405
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,070
Oh, it's where Dixon's from.

406
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,490
Wait, you don't know Dixon.

407
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,960
Of course not.

408
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,680
Well, neither do I, apparently.
That's the problem.

409
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,700
How do you know anybody?

410
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,950
You have to go backwards in order
to understand how to go forwards.

411
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,740
So, working backwards.

412
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,770
Why didn't Dixon react to the movie
the way that I thought he would?

413
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:16,590
Because there are fundamental things
about him that I don't understand.

414
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,020
It's like chemistry.

415
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,750
Li baking soda and vinegar.

416
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,250
You can put vinegar with something other than
baking soda and it won't react the same way.

417
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,190
So, my movie, in this example, is the vinegar,

418
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,670
which means, inherently, that it's not a
bad movie because if-if Dixon was sugar,

419
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,920
then everything would have
been fine, but he's not.

420
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,460
He's the baking soda.
Hence his eruption.

421
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:43,300
So, I have to understand
what makes Dixon baking soda.

422
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,440
And how do you understand how
anyone becomes who they are?

423
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:53,670
You have to go back to the past, all
of their previous chemical reactions.

424
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:57,320
Imagine all the moments in Dixon's
life that made him who he is.

425
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,280
All the moments and-and the moments
that lead up to those moments

426
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,940
because there are no
disconnected moments.

427
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,280
Every moment is connected
to a million other moments.

428
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,110
God, it’s... exhausting.

429
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,680
But if you track them back,

430
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,410
you find the original moment,

431
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:17,260
the source of everything, which is...

432
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,980
Next in line.

433
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,290
Kansas.

434
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,240
I'm going to Kansas.

435
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,150
Here. I have to get to Kansas.

436
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,470
11:35,track 12.

437
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,410
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

438
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,510
Next in line? Sir?

439
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,720
I want my mommy.

440
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,820
Quick, baby whisperer, do something.

441
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,730
- Hey, Sammy. It's okay.
- I want my mommy.

442
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,690
- Adrianna can help you.
- Hey, Sammy.

443
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,910
Everybody, stop crying. Stop crying.

444
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,120
He's turning pink. Is that normal?

445
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,650
It's okay. look. Look, look.

446
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,940
- Big smiling face!
- Put it away.

447
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,190
Okay, it's okay, it's okay.

448
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,700
Uh, I am dying here.

449
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,620
- Couch.
- Okay.

450
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,590
Those are really cool PJs.

451
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,420
You look sharp. Is that.

452
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,390
What do you have on
them? Is that trucks?

453
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,080
Oh, my gosh. I love trucks.

454
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,740
- That's my favorite mode of transportation.
- Tractors.

455
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,770
Except for tractors.

456
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,990
I was going to say that.

457
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,420
I just, I love them more.

458
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,670
Sammy, do you know what
Adrianna’s really good at?

459
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,000
What?

460
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:39,420
Opening my hands like A...

461
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,470
oh, reading books.

462
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,380
I'm really good at
reading books to kids.

463
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,910
It's actually a secret
talent of mine, actually, so...

464
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,680
you want... you want us to read this one?

465
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,450
Picture book about, um, trucks?

466
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,140
Tractors. Get with the program.

467
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,400
Okay, uh...

468
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,390
Sammy, Adrianna does
a great tractor voice.

469
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,870
Hit it.

470
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,710
I'm a tractor!

471
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:07,380
I like to tract things.

472
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,300
Professional actress right here, Sammy.
 
474
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,230
You should hear her do a dump truck.

473
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,050
anyways, let's get started.

474
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,190
Do you want to move closer to Navid?

475
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,480
Would you be more comfortable? Let's go.

476
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,120
Okay...

477
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:26,340
once upon a time, there
lived a grouchy old tractor

478
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,180
named Mr. Grumples

479
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,830
Look, it's Mr. Grumples.

480
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,920
What are you doing?

481
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,830
Just trying to open Silver's locker.

482
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,130
Here. She's had the same
combination since sixth grade.

483
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,050
I don't know what I'm looking for.

484
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,070
- This is all so weird.
- Yeah, I know, right?

485
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,410
Oh, my God. I can't believe she has that.

486
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,920
- That's you?
- Yeah, me and Silver.

487
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,000
With what seems to
be pots on your heads?

488
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,290
Yeah, we were alone at
my house, hanging out.

489
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,430
I think we were,like,12.

490
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:28,470
We suddenly felt this huge
earthquake and totally freaked out

491
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:31,100
and got a bunch of pots and ran
and hid under the kitchen table.

492
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,400
Was it a big earthquake?

493
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,120
Oh, no, it wasn't an earthquake at all.

494
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,950
Apparently, our neighbors decided
to upgrade to a pebble driveway

495
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,000
and had been jackhammering
the pavement up next door.

496
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,350
How long were you under the table?

497
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,610
At least an hour, maybe
two. I don't remember.

498
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,630
Oh, I don't know how long
we would have been there

499
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,430
if Ethan hadn't shown up to
tell us about the jackhammer.

500
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,730
Anyway...

501
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:57,770
yeah, anyway, my dad said
we should keep looking.

502
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,220
Yeah, I'm going to go check the gym.

503
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,120
- what are you doing?
- Honey, I'm trying to figure out Dixon's password.

504
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,190
I've tried his name, his
birthday, the chiefs...

505
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,310
why do you need to get into his...

506
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,240
because I have no idea who he is, Harry.

507
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,340
Deb, what's going on?

508
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,410
I have no clue what's going on.

509
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,890
Our son is acting like a stranger.

510
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,190
You saw him down there.

511
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,790
He is hostile and
callous and having sex.

512
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,300
Okay, fine. Maybe that's normal,

513
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,990
but the rest of it is not.

514
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,240
It's this place.

515
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,940
It's L.A., Beverly hills.

516
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,370
The morals are different here.

517
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,260
I mean, kids grow up way too fast,

518
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,210
and we made a huge
mistake by coming here.

519
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,950
Deb...

520
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,370
- Silver.
- Uh, no. Uh, my name is Kevin.

521
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:51,460
But I'm here with a
girl named Erin Silver.

522
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,260
She's in a pretty bad way,

523
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,120
d I-I just thought I should
call someone and let them know,

524
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,200
and you know, this was the
last number she called.

525
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,820
Where is she? Where are you?

526
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,350
Union station.

527
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,050
Uh, Erin here bought
herself a ticket to Kansas.

528
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,900
You know, her train hasn't left yet.

529
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,630
Right now, she's kind of passed out,

530
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,100
but she's acting pretty erratic and,

531
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,470
I mean, who knows what she might do?

532
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,910
- We're on our way. We will be there as soon as we can.
- Yeah.

533
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,400
- look, we can't break up.
- What?

534
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,040
Relationships are work and
that's all we need to do.

535
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,390
We need to work on things.

536
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,890
We shouldn't give up so easily.

537
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,410
But, Annie, things haven't been good.

538
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,990
- We haven't been happy.
- I-I know, I know that.

539
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,930
Okay, but we will be. We-we
just have to fix this.

540
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,330
Okay? We have to.

541
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,290
We have to work at this.

542
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:47,550
- Why?
- Why? Because... because of Naomi.

543
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,440
Naomi's going to find out eventually.

544
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,860
Naomi's going to find out about what?

545
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,870
This isn't about Naomi finding out.

546
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,520
This is about Naomi.

547
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,060
When I first moved here,

548
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:04,370
she reached out to me and we h the
potential to be friends, to be real friends,

549
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:08,410
and then she asked me not to go out
with you, but I...I didn't listen.

550
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,570
I went behind her back
and I started dating you,

551
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,810
which is a really jerky
thing to do. But I did it.

552
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:16,400
Because I had a good reason.

553
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,260
I believed that you were the one.

554
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,260
I thought... I thought
that we were the ones.

555
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,980
Our relationship, you and
me, it was worth anything.

556
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:32,000
It was worth sacrificing friends
and even some of my self-respect.

557
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,920
But if we're not together, and
we break up, then what?

558
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:40,260
Then I didn't make these
sacrifices for our relationship.

559
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,320
I was just being a jerk.

560
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,580
If we can't make things work, then I
have to accept everything that I've done.

561
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,810
And... and...

562
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,060
and we are.

563
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,690
We are...

564
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,620
we are broken up.

565
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:08,750
And... and I've been a jerk.

566
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:13,080
I've been a jerk, and...

567
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,490
me and Ethan?

568
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,430
We're broken up.

569
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,290
It's okay, Erin.

570
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,130
How do you know my name?

571
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,810
What time is it?

572
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,700
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

573
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,900
I got to go! I got to go.

574
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,260
Erin! Wait!

575
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,320
no! Stop, stop, stop!

576
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,880
Don't leave without me! Stop! Please!

577
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:10,150
Silver! Silver, get off the tracks.

578
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,280
It was my train.

579
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:17,110
First Ryan drained my gas
tank, and then I missed my train.

580
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,030
And I am never going
to make it to Kansas.

581
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,310
Harry: Okay, Silver, calm down.

582
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,960
It doesn't matter if
you missed your train.

583
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,670
She's such a drama queen.

584
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:26,140
- It's unbelievable.
- How could you say that?

585
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,590
Well, I had it all figured out.

586
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:33,480
I was going to go to Kansas
because Kansas equals Dixon,

587
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,950
and Dixon equals baking soda.

588
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,950
Doesn't make sense...

589
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:43,180
but it did it did make
sense, and now it doesn’t.

590
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,890
- I know.
- Don't! Don't come near me.

591
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,240
Okay.

592
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,420
Everything was making
sense, but now it doesn’t.

593
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:57,300
Everything was so
great, but now it's so dark.

594
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:01,520
It is so dark here.

595
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,080
It is always, always dark.

596
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,070
- Silver, please get off the tracks.
- I am so confused.

597
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,980
Come on.  Silver.

598
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,560
- I don't know what's going on anymore.
- Silver, get off the tracks.

599
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,110
- Silver!
- Silver!

600
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,050
you don't understand!

601
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,200
- Silver, no!
- No!

602
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,460
- Dixon!
- Wait, wait. I got this.

603
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:41,490
Silver! It's me.

604
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,900
It's Dixon. Listen,

605
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,330
i do understand.

606
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:48,090
I do! Everything was so good for you,

607
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:54,100
and now it feels like the
world is crumbling around you.

608
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,000
Everything made
sense, and now it doesn't,

609
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,770
but it's okay, Silver.

610
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,730
I know what you're going through,

611
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:05,430
'cause my mom used to go
through the same type of thing.

612
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,830
Some days, she was so happy, she
couldn't contain herself.

613
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,990
Like, one day, she just
took me out of school.

614
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,680
Just showed up in the middle of the day

615
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,290
and took me out of school.

616
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,600
Said we were going to Disneyland.

617
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,010
But she didn't stay happy.

618
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,220
By the time we got there,

619
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,810
she was just sad and confused.

620
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,600
We didn't end up leaving the motel room.

621
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,050
That's how she was.

622
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,750
Up and down, up and down.

623
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:47,020
But that wasn't her fault.

624
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,550
She just needed help, Silver.

625
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:53,520
It's okay, all right? I'm here.

626
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,230
And I'm going to help you get help.

627
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,380
All right?

628
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:09,790
everything's gonna be okay.

629
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,800
Kelly, I'm so sorry.

630
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,250
I screwed it all up, didn't I?

631
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:36,470
You let me in your
house, you gave me a chance,

632
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:39,290
try to make things better, and
I screwed it all up.

633
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,120
You're gonna get rid of me, aren't you?

634
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,200
- You're gonna send me back to my mom.
- No, no, no.

635
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,650
I'm not going anywhere, and
neither are you.

636
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:52,000
- Are you okay? -
She's manic-depressive.

637
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:55,110
It's not drugs.

638
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:00,540
Silver has bipolar disorder
just like my birth mom.

639
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,750
That has to be it.

640
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,870
Well, I'm just glad she's safe.

641
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,080
Yeah, it's a huge relief.

642
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,440
I'll drop you off at home.

643
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,960
- Okay.
- No, I'll take her.

644
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,370
- Are you sure?
- I mean, it's on the way home.

645
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,210
- Well, sort of.
- Thanks.

646
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:33,270
- Bye, Ethan.
- Bye, Annie.

647
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,940
So, there are a lot of
other fish in the sea.

648
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,950
- Equally cute fish.
- Yeah, well, thanks.

649
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:45,070
And, um, I really am
sorry about how I acted.

650
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:47,330
I get it. It's okay.

651
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,300
Trust me, I wasn't exactly
the nicest person either.

652
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,010
I mean, nice is not really my thing.

653
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,370
No, it's not.

654
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:56,430
- But still, I'm sorry, too.
- Thank you...

655
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,700
I guess.

656
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,450
okay, not to gossip or anything,

657
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,910
but have you heard what
Adrianna calls Navid?

658
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,430
- Sesame balls.
- What?

659
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:11,880
- Sesame balls! - No
way. - Sesame balls!

660
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,830
And what is your
relationship to the patient?

661
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,250
I'm her sister.

662
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,040
"And he went into the barn

663
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:26,150
and who did he find
there but Mr. Grumples,

664
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:31,370
looking all spiffy with a shiny
new coat of bright red paint.

665
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,420
The End.

666
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,810
Aw, he was a nice tractor after all.

667
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,640
He's out.

668
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,690
When did he fall asleep?

669
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:44,780
Back when Mr. Grumples was
crossing the bridge to jersey city.

670
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,430
Oh, I wanted, I wanted to
see how it turned out.

671
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,710
This was actually kind of fun.

672
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,530
We make a pretty good team.

673
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,710
Yeah, we do.

674
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,570
- How is she?
- She's gonna be okay.

675
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,190
You didn't have to stay.

676
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:32,650
A chauffeur is not done until
his charge is safely back at home.

677
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:36,150
Look, Ryan, I owe you an apology
for the way I treated you.

678
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:38,840
No, Kelly, I owe you an apology.

679
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,140
I haven't really been your friend.

680
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:47,060
I slept with Brenda, which
I knew would hurt you...

681
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,910
which is why I did it.

682
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:53,250
I had feelings for you, Kelly, and
then you went to see Dylan and...

683
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,740
it doesn't matter 'cause
you didn't owe me anything.

684
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:00,840
And I was stupid and spiteful...

685
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,890
and I'm really sorry.

686
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:14,300
And I realize it's completely unprofessional for
a chauffeur to try and befriend his charge, but...

687
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,320
I'd like to.

688
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,860
I'd like that, too.

689
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,290
- But I'm still gonna sit in the back seat on the way home.
- Okay.

690
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,930
- Dixon was great out there.
- I know. He was.

691
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:46,520
Can you imagine what that would be like?

692
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,160
First your birth mother, and then your
girlfriend both being manic-depressive?

693
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,360
It'd be like lightning striking twice.

694
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,890
- It's no wonder he reacted the way he did.
- Oh, yeah.

695
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,560
Listen, I'm sorry I
kind of lost it before.

696
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,080
Oh, no, honey, it's okay.

697
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,810
It's understandable.

698
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,720
But I think that we
should talk, you know?

699
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,620
If you're unhappy in L.A., We can leave.

700
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,980
- But you can't keep bringing it up every time something goes wrong.
- I know.

701
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,350
We haven't taken the bid on the house.

702
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:18,580
We can move back to Kansas
if that's what you want.

703
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,030
But we can't have one foot
here and one foot there.

704
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,800
We have to decide.

705
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,270
What do you want?

706
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,630
Me?

707
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,470
I like it here.

708
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:33,760
And I think it is a great
place to raise our kids.

709
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,600
And I think the kids
in Kansas have sex, too.

710
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,520
I know, I know they do.

711
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,110
And I like it here, too.

712
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,600
But the most important thing for me is

713
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,750
whether or not this is a
good place to raise a family.

714
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,540
And I think it is.

715
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:52,820
There are opportunities and culture and all sorts
of things here that you can't find in Kansas.

716
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:56,740
Museums and galleries and theater and...

717
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,370
gluten-free bread.

718
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:03,160
And I don't even know what gluten is, but
I like the option of not having to eat it.

719
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,890
I like options.

720
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,470
And Beverly Hills has options.

721
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,980
It's a bigger world here.

722
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,830
And I think that's a good thing.

723
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:15,210
You think we should
stay in Beverly Hills?

724
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,840
I think that we should
stay in Beverly Hills.

725
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,520
Well, it sounds like
you were pretty amazing.

726
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,820
And not at first, for sure.

727
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:29,550
When Silver called, I totally bugged out.

728
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:32,250
You know, she just kept going on,

729
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:35,480
saying I was the only thing
that made her life worth living.

730
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,220
And it was that kind
of manipulative thing

731
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,990
that my mom used to say to me.

732
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:46,630
You know, so I just had a bad
reaction and just freaked out.

733
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,780
Did you know that then?

734
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:52,170
I mean, did you know why you were upset?

735
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:55,440
No,I had no clue.

736
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,530
I mean, didn't put it all together
until we were at the train station.

737
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,320
Then I guess I saw how she shifted from

738
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,100
being so happy to being so despondent.

739
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,810
It all made sense.

740
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:12,050
Geez, what a night.

741
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:15,630
- You can say that again.
- What a night.

742
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:19,320
- You can say that again and again.
- what a night.

743
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,850
Debbie: Ooh, French toast.

744
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,510
I'm starving.

745
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:30,250
- The bread is gluten-free.
- I will explain later.

746
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:38,060
- How about some French toast?
- Drown it!

747
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,870
I say, drown it.
