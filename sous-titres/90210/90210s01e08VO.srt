1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
Previously on 90210:

2
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,970
This is kimberly mcintyre,she's transferring to west beverly starting today.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,710
You guys are coming tonight,right?

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,210
Why does this suddenly feel like a double-date?

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,460
I can help you deal with this but you've got to let me.

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,710
Your department made quite the scene today.

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,460
We did this now because then they'll figure the bust already happened.

8
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,290
Harry,can I talk to you for a second?

9
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,850
- Sure.
- It's about our son.

10
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,840
Whoa,whoa,tracy.

11
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,990
I need you to tell them that the drugs were yours.

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:25,770
Okay.

13
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,270
If she confesses it should help.

14
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,490
But you know there's no guarantees.

15
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,720
Adrianna is going to be here.

16
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,640
If you just give her a few more minutes.

17
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,640
I cannot believe you did this to me.

18
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,340
We're done,I hope you got that.

19
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,870
You're dead to me.

20
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,640
Well,you and tracy certainly made an attractive homecoming king and queen.

21
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,600
It's funny how you look older and she looks just the same.

22
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,990
Hmm,maybe I should pay a visit to "dr.Make-it-tight."

23
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,120
Yeah,believe me that's the nicest thing I've thought since she kissed you.

24
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,900
Well,I-I appreciate your holding back.

25
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,690
At least in public.

26
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,400
Yeah,yeah,you're the principal so I'm like a politician's wife

27
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,780
and she's the head of the parent board so I have to be nice.

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,790
But I don't like her.

29
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,100
I don't blame you,but thank you.

30
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,530
All right,the speed limit unless otherwise posted in residential areas is.

31
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,310
25 miles per hour,come on.

32
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,650
Give me another one.

33
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,900
All right,uh,parallel parking on a level street?

34
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,530
18 inches.

35
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,270
Uphill?

36
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,480
Turn your wheels away from the curb.

37
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,410
Damn.

38
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,500
Looks like somebody is ready to get her driver's permit.

39
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,410
Yeah.

40
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,880
Yeah,and if you pass your test tomorrow you can drive your mother

41
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,610
and i to the homecoming dance.

42
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,310
Aw,come on,for real?

43
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,530
You guys are really chaperoning?

44
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,050
Yes,we are chaperoning.

45
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,360
You're taking silver,right?

46
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,410
Yes,sir,asking her today.

47
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,370
I got it all planned out already,you know?

48
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,100
Got the suit,the shoes,restaurant.

49
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,030
You know,how you taught me.

50
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,320
Yeah,yeah.

51
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,110
How about you,honey?

52
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:03,990
You going to go to the dance?

53
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,570
Um,yeah,I would have to be asked first.

54
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,990
Running out of time.

55
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,520
Thank you,thank you for that.

56
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,890
Of course ethan will ask you.

57
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,910
He's not going to homecoming with naomi.

58
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,750
- And you did share a
- What did you call it?

59
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,340
An "almost" kiss.

60
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,440
Ah,yes,well,when the "almost" wedding is,

61
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,380
just let me know 'cause I'll buy you an "almost" gift.

62
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,110
Shut up!

63
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,870
And look,there he is now.

64
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,410
Why don't you just ask him yourself?

65
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,290
Not with her looking right at me.

66
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,820
So,want to go to homecoming?

67
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,480
No.

68
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,220
Really?

69
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,160
Why?

70
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,580
Because it's everything wrong with this place in stark relief.

71
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,430
It's like a big popularity contest set to music.

72
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,800
You don't want to go,do you?

73
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,300
Oh,nah,nah,no,no,no.

74
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,200
- I don't like that crap.
- Yeah.

75
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,720
I thought it was,you know,stuff girls like.

76
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,340
Um,other girls,maybe.

77
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,600
So,I mean we could go,you uknow,

78
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,600
and make fun of people if that's what you want.

79
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,200
Well,I am actually scheduled to get my wisdom teeth out tomorrow,

80
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,500
so maybe you could come over and make fun of me?

81
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,450
I'm going to have a big chipmunk face.

82
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,030
Sounds kind of kinky,but,uh,maybe that's your way of,

83
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,700
uh,asking m to take care of you.

84
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,010
No,this is.

85
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,550
Really?

86
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,280
You're here a week and those are the people you want to be friends with?

87
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,120
Are you jealous?

88
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,550
Do you want to be my friend?

89
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,940
No,I don'T.

90
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,350
So,are you going to homecoming,teacher?

91
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,710
I'll be there as a chaperone.

92
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,640
And what are you going to wear?Something sexy?

93
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,900
You know what,kimberly,you're crossing the line.

94
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,250
Knock it off.

95
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,070
Aw,did I hurt your feelings?

96
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,200
Just get to class.

97
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,370
Just brushing up on my rare road signs.

98
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,770
I'm taking my permit test.

99
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,510
Well,if you need any lessons I could probably help you out.

100
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,260
People tell me I'm an excellent driver.

101
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,340
Oh,people tell you that,do they?

102
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,120
Yeah,I mean,it's a little embarrassing,all the acclaim,but,uh,I got the skills.

103
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,190
You've got something.

104
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:55,690
So,anyway,uh,I wanted to tell you that I would like to invite you to homecoming.

105
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,700
Okay.

106
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,030
But I'm not going to.

107
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,930
Okay,um,are you going to take naomi?

108
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,140
No,no,we were going to go together,um,but we're broken up now,

109
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,580
so,which is good,um,but it just feels like a little soon.

110
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,360
Not to be going out with you.

111
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,460
I mean to be going to homecoming with you.

112
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,510
Does that make any sense?

113
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,980
Oddly,that all made sense,yes.

114
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,980
But,uh,just 'cause we're not going together

115
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,500
doesn't mean that we can't dance together at the dance.

116
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,430
Yes,well,if we're going to do that then that would be the place to do it.

117
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,530
Okay,okay,so here's the plan.

118
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,180
You show up,then I show up.

119
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,740
Then it'll be total surprise,like,"oh,my god,you're here?

120
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,930
Oh,my god,I'm here too."

121
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,860
Then.

122
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,070
we dance?

123
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,970
So,I'll see you at homecoming.

124
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,610
I-I will be there.

125
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,730
I am not your date,though.

126
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,770
Oh,no,no,no,no,you are not my date.

127
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,540
Well,adrianna's mom contacted us first.

128
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,870
And what did she have to say?

129
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,640
That I'm the druggy and I'm bringing her poor little girl down,

130
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,230
and,oh,adrianna's so fragile she can barely talk about it?

131
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,860
Adrianna almost died.

132
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,010
- What?
- Oh,no.

133
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,660
Of a drug overdose.

134
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,360
Not always about you,is it,naomi?

138
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,230
Well,is she okay?

139
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,250
What happened?

140
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,080
Emt's resuscitated her,they took her to the hospital and pumped her stomach.

141
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,250
Is she going to be all right?

142
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,780
Yeah,she's going to be fine,but she was lucky.

143
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:49,110
And since it's her first offense she's going to court-ordered rehab.

144
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,120
As for you,when the police took her statement,

145
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,150
she said that the drugs you flushed were hers.

146
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,370
And since it's your first offense,you're not going to be expelled.

147
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,980
So will naomi be facing any drug charges?

148
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,380
The police said we could handle it here.

149
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,280
The school board has suggested afternoon detention

150
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,880
for the rest of the semester for lying about the drugs.

151
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,930
How does that sound to you?

152
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,490
Take it and run,naomi.

153
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,150
Thank you.

154
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,100
I'm not going in there.

155
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,750
It'll be okay.

156
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,140
You'll be okay.

157
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,050
Don't say that.

158
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,290
You don't know that.

159
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,430
Baby!

160
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,970
You are at one of the most famous rehabs in the world.

161
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,250
I don't know what we're doing here.

162
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,220
We can't afford this.

163
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,470
Yes,we can.

164
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,490
Bill is a great lawyer.

165
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,450
He said he was able to pull some strings and he got you in gratis.

166
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,110
Isn't that great?

167
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,640
I mean,I just,I don't want you to worry about that.

168
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,180
I just want you to focus on getting better.

169
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,230
Mom,please don't leave me here.

170
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,080
You're going to feel better.

171
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,770
I,I just want you to get better,okay?

172
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,180
Will you do that for me?

173
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,310
Doing some redecorating?

174
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,230
Just getting rid of some trash.

175
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,310
You okay?

176
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,530
Great!

177
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,170
My best friend almost let me get kicked out of school before she od'D.

178
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,560
My boyfriend isn't my boyfriend anymore.

179
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,370
My parents are getting divorced.

180
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,860
It's been a fun month.

181
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,700
If there's anything that I can do,I mean,

182
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,820
I really don't know what to say,but.

183
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,260
thank you.

184
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,210
You know,you've only ever been really nice to me.

185
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,760
I don't think I've ever appreciated it.

186
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,470
Anytime.

187
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,550
You know what?

188
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,180
A bunch of the girls are coming over to my place to get ready before homecoming.

189
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,800
Going to go as a group.

190
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,170
You want to come?

191
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,070
You're probably going with somebody else.

192
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,160
Well,um,no.

193
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,150
No?

194
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,960
Great,then you can come with us.

195
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,270
It'll be so much fun,I promise.

196
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,900
You know what?

197
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,190
That-that does sound like fun.

198
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,180
Good.

199
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,730
Thanks.

200
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:03,970
With naomi?

201
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,830
You've got to be kidding me.

202
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,330
I'm serious.

203
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,090
It was really nice of her.

204
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,240
And I felt bad,I couldn't say no.

205
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,010
I-I think it'll be fun.

206
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,850
Okay.

207
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,010
What?

208
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,770
No,it's just weird.

209
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,210
You guys hanging out.

210
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,960
Oh,don't be jealous.

211
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,860
Oh,yeah,that's what I am.

212
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,440
I'm still going to dance with you.

213
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,890
Oh,I know you're still going to dance with me.

214
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,350
Cause you know,dancing's like,my thing.

215
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,950
Oh,oh,is it?

216
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,030
Dancing's your thing.

217
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,980
I thought driving was your thing.

218
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,120
You know,I got a lot of things.

219
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,590
I'm a very well-rounded individual,so.

220
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,840
all right.

221
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,440
Ok,I got to go.

222
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,530
Mom's here.

223
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,880
Uh,yeah,me too.

224
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,260
Uh,got to go find a new thing,so.

225
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,700
Hi,I'm naomi clarke.

226
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,600
Sign in,please.

227
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,130
What'd you do to get in here?

228
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,600
You sleep with a teacher?

229
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,200
No,I turned them all down.

230
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,750
Oh,what,they didn't pay enough?

231
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,390
Not nearly.

232
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,660
What's your deal?

233
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,300
You know,I saw your big poster out there in the hallway.

234
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,930
I take it you're probably going to

235
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,060
go to homecoming with one of the other big posters.

236
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,630
You know,you one-dimensional creatures usually stick together.

237
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,140
It's a good thing.

238
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,560
I'm ozzie,by the way.

239
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,280
Oh,see now,that's your first mistake.

240
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,350
Because now that I know who you are,

241
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,760
it's going to sting so much more when I never talk to you again.

242
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,030
Nice.Mexican nanny?

243
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,070
Honduran.

244
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:12,960
Hello.

245
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,640
No talking.

246
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,270
Okay,remember to fasten your seat belt,make sure your mirrors.

247
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,270
adjust my mirrors,both: .And your parking brake is off.

248
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,740
- And?
- I got it.

249
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,890
And,and,don't play the radio too loud,

250
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,550
don't drive when tired and don't get distracted by the other kids in the car.

251
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,840
So did ethan finally ask you to homecoming?

252
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,770
Way to slip that one in.

253
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,380
Um,kind of.

254
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,730
We're going to hang when we get there,

255
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,780
but we're not actually going together.

256
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:47,780
Annie.

257
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,380
I just distracted you.

258
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,940
Oh,well,that was sneaky.

259
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,090
That's my point.

260
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,490
Okay,onward.

261
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,590
Now,always remember your license and you're insurance card.

262
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,630
We're with state farm.

263
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,640
If you ever get pulled over.

264
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,420
I won'T.

265
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,670
You never know.The insurance card is right here in the glove box.

266
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,350
Got it.

267
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,060
Thanks.

268
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,620
Now,can we talk about what kind of car you're going to get me?

269
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,660
Can we talk about what kind of job you're going to get?

270
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,410
Right.

271
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,780
Adrianna,you have a visitor.

272
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,280
I do?

273
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,090
Navid?

274
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,850
What are you doing here?

275
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,480
I'm actually here to do a story for the blaze news.

276
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,410
Let you tell your side of the story.

277
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,800
Inside the walls of currents-- it's A.

278
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,200
it's a privilege.

279
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,400
That's one weird way of looking at it.

280
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,290
Give me your phone.

281
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,720
What?

282
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,360
They don't let us have our own.

283
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,240
They let us use the pay phone once a day.

284
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,210
It's kind of like prison in 1970.

285
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,170
Wait,you're not texting any lowlifes are you?

286
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,130
'Cause I really can't have.

287
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,660
I'm texting naomi.

288
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,900
I left her like 15 messages before I came here.

289
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,660
Hey,well,look,I got you some really great reading material.

290
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,070
Check it out.

291
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,030
So how are you doing in here?

292
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:17,350
I'm not doing your stupid story,so you can just get the hell out of here.

293
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,340
Hey,hold on.

294
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,190
Listen,if you.

295
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,560
if you ever want to talk,you know.

296
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,220
off the record.

297
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,540
just give me a call,okay?

298
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,490
SO WILL U COME SEE ME?
I MISS U  I NEED U  A

299
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,510
Message Deleted

300
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,990
**********

301
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,040
I'm thinking.

302
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,620
I don't want to talk to you.

303
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,930
I was thinking that you are not my friend.

304
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:17,090
I'm thinking I want to talk to my real friend,naomi.

305
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:17,850
That's good.

306
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,570
You're claiming responsibility.

307
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,140
Claiming responsibility,yeah.

308
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,450
So what?

309
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,450
Obviously it was my fault.

310
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,460
I don't want to miss her.

311
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,360
She was trying to help me,and then I hurt her.

312
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:47,970
So badly,so deeply that she's never going to forgive me.

313
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,860
And I can't live with myself knowing that I did something that awful.

314
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,000
All you can do right now is be here.

315
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,860
This is the last place I want to be.

316
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,530
Do your ears hang low?

317
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,200
Do they wobble to and fro?

318
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,430
Can you tie 'em in A.

319
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,420
you know what?

320
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,180
What?

321
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,190
It is easy to get your wisdom teeth out.

322
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,630
I loved it.

323
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,880
Yeah.

324
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,990
It was pretty fun for me,too.

325
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,030
Except you've been singing that song for the last half hour.

326
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,880
It's like a perfect song.

327
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,580
It's my favorite song.

328
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,250
Yeah,okay.

329
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,710
Well,um,you stay here.

330
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,910
I'm going to go get you some water,all right?

331
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,750
The doctor said take two more of these in three hours,

332
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,530
but I think I might have to cut the doses in half,

333
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,310
because you seem pretty responsive to the medication.

334
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,700
Thank you so much.

335
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,520
I'm just.

336
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,800
So happy right now.

337
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,330
Aren't you so happy?

338
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,110
Pretty happy.

339
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,510
But probably not as happy as you are.

340
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,960
I'm so glad we both hate homecoming.

341
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,780
This is so much better.

342
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,010
I'm gonna lie down.

343
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,550
Okay.

344
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,410
Take.

345
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,070
Guess not.

346
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,540
Hello.

347
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,100
Hey.

348
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,460
- How'd it go?
- I got my permit.

349
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,720
I got 100% on the test.

350
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,800
And in a few weeks when I turn 16.

351
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,310
I don't even want to think about it.

352
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,110
I'll be cruising down sunset.

353
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,810
See,now that's where I got in my first accident.

354
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,050
Me and a bunch of my buddies were.

355
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,560
screwing around in the car and got distracted?

356
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,040
Something like that.

357
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,880
Yeah,see,I know not to do that.

358
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,530
That's because women are better drivers.

359
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,610
Not true.

360
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,290
Here,you can learn a few things,dad.

361
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,590
It's never too late.

362
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,050
Don't you have a dance to get ready for?

363
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,980
Congratulations.

364
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,160
Thank you.

365
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,410
Thanks for calling.

366
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,490
It was nice to hear from you.

367
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,970
So what's up?

368
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,100
There's some country western singer that's supposed to be some big deal--

369
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,200
she was snoring so loudly last night,I couldn't sleep.

370
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,140
I figured you could use that for your story.

371
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,270
That's pretty good,but I'm not actually doing that story anymore.

372
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,170
Just wanted to check up on you.

373
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,790
And I figured since I was coming,I'd bring you some supplies.

374
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,660
Not the kind I'm dreaming about,I bet.

375
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,840
I brought you some scratch paper,some colored pencils.

376
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,930
I don't know if you draw,but I figured everybody likes to doodle,so.

377
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,640
and,uh,oh yeah,this is going to be awesome right here.

378
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,530
oh,yeah,uh.

379
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,890
got you a little gift box with shampoo--

380
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,620
lavender extract,conditioner and toner,

381
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,920
which I honestly don't know what that is,but my mom suggested it.

382
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:02,410
Oh,one more thing-- I got you a couple dvds.

383
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,210
Do they let you watch dvds?

384
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,130
Yeah,as long as we don't sprinkle coke on our popcorn.

385
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,730
It's all good.

386
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,870
Great.

387
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,990
Uh,well,enjoy then.

388
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,800
Navid.

389
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,450
I need you to do something for me.

390
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,050
Yeah,uh,what's that?

391
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,950
Bring naomi here,okay?

392
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,730
Get her to talk to me.

393
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,300
I...

394
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,610
well,I can ask her,but I don't know if I can make her.

395
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,140
please.

396
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,360
Please,can you bring her here?

397
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,250
Will you do that for me?

398
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,450
I need to apologize.

399
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,430
It's killing me.

400
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,730
I have someone's thumb stuck in my ass.

401
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,070
Oh,ll,you'd certainly know what that feels like,wouldn't you,nina?

402
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,400
Ew,gross!

403
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,210
Forgive us.We don't exactly censor here.

404
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,190
No,it's fun.

405
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,350
Like sisters.

406
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,560
Oh,yeah,not my sister.

407
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,180
I would beg to get to go out with her girlfriends.

408
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,510
She'd be like,"oh,yeah,go get ready."

409
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:26,710
I'd run upstairs,do my hair and makeup,you know,get all dolled up.

410
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,040
Come downstairs,she's gone.

411
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,460
Thanks,sis.

412
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,290
Whatever.

413
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,640
I always wanted a brother instead.

414
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,790
Yeah,me,too.

415
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,010
I didn't get mine until I was eight,but it was worth the wait.

416
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,050
We fight,but he's probably my best friend.

417
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,970
That's cool.

418
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,570
I always thought an older brother would,you know,

419
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,200
look out for me,kick anybody's ass who messed with me,

420
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,040
that sort of thing.

421
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,720
All right,look.

422
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,260
Ah,oh,wow.

423
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,410
You look gorgeous!

424
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,750
You are going to get some action tonight,girl.

425
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,910
Big smile.

426
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,900
Too bad adrianna's not here.

427
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,290
Can I see that before you put another picture of me

428
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,080
with my eyes closed on your facebook page?

429
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:14,710
Annie,shoes time.

430
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,110
I'm gonna wear these,I think.

431
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,840
These will look great for you.

432
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,870
Really?

433
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,210
But they look so expensive.

434
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,260
Oh,whatever.They're just shoes.

435
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,920
Um,naomi,can I ask you something?

436
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,360
Yeah,of course.What's up?

437
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:32,520
Is it weird that you're not going to homecoming with ethan?

438
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,900
Ethan and I broke up.

439
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,690
It'd be weird if I was going with him.

440
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,110
Well,I know,but.

441
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,910
look,we've broken up so many times 

442
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,660
so many times afterwards I've just wanted him to be miserable,you know?

443
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,630
This time's different.

444
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,940
I just want him to be happy.

445
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,410
And I want to be happy,too.

446
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,750
is everybody decent?

447
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,250
Ask nina.

448
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,710
Oh,yeah,I am.

449
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,750
Well,naomi,you have a gentleman caller.

450
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,190
What?Who?

451
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,720
Come on in!

452
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,230
Thank you.

453
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,500
Sure.

454
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:14,380
Hey,uh,can I talk to you for a minute?

455
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,840
Ah,baby,you awake?

456
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,210
No,I'm asleep.

457
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,210
But I'm talking to you.

458
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,510
My mouth feels so frickin' bad.

459
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,720
When was I supposed to take another pirate?

460
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,300
A what?

461
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,360
A pill.

462
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,160
What did I say?

463
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,370
******

464
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,640
*********

465
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:44,520
But,uh,you were supposed to take another pill.

466
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,730
uh,about an hour ago,but you were asleep.

467
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,100
You should have woken me up!

468
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,460
Now it's gonna take an hour for this one to kick in.

469
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,130
Sweetheart,which one?

470
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,260
Well,the green one goes better with what I'm wearing,

471
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,950
and I want to remind tracy that we go together just in case she gets confused.

472
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,960
Don't worry.

473
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,770
I won't be confused.

474
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,720
Well,I'm sure as hell confused.

475
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,720
Why don't you say something to her?

476
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,820
To who?

477
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,900
To tracy.

478
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:19,860
Good lord,debby,I didn't know kansas women had no cojones.

479
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,290
I've got it,tabitha.

480
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,550
That woman kissed your husband.

481
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,310
Yes,and my husband and I have dealt with it,and it's over.

482
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,760
I understand what happened.

483
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:34,610
What else would you do in wichita,bake her a cake?

484
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:37,010
This is beverly hills,sweetheart.

485
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,080
You really shouldn't be drinking,tabitha.

486
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,480
It's kool-aid.

487
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:50,850
Look,I could squash you with an eye roll,but you could take on tracy.

488
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:57,880
When it comes class,brains and beauty,my dear,she's no match for you.

489
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:05,260
Tabitha,I think that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.

490
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,010
Oh,that's okay.

491
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,290
I won't remember it in the morning.

492
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:42,570
Hey,can I have you guys fill our your ballots for king and queen,please and thank you?

493
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:47,110
Boy,life is full of irony,isn't it?

494
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:49,950
Come on.

495
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,720
Let's get closer to the band.

496
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,390
This band is so great.

497
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,200
Oh,my god,they play at the viper room all the time.

498
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,710
It's so amazing that you guys get such cool bands to play at your school dances.

499
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,150
I mean,in kansas,it was usually three stoners playing for munchie money.

500
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,470
Oh,god,that's so sad!

501
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,450
Excuse me.

502
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,930
No excuse.

503
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,580
Oh,hey,rude.

504
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,080
You look cute.

505
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:24,080
Keep in mind,less isn't always more.

506
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,830
Guys like it when you leave a little to the imagination.

507
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,730
Thank you.

508
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,290
Okay,who was that?

509
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:40,300
That was my detention buddy.

510
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,070
He's a smart-ass.

511
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,230
With a hot ass.

512
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,980
that sounds like something I would say.

513
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:53,610
I'm gonna go get us some fruity,non-alcoholic crappy drinks.

514
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,990
Where is she?

515
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,500
Uh,she's not feeling very well.

516
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,140
She had a really bad migraine.

517
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,560
She said she might not even make it to the homecoming.

518
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,650
You're a terrible liar,navid.

519
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,080
I know she's gonna be there.

520
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,130
She doesn't want to talk to me,does she?

521
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Hey,I'm here.

522
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,150
I'll talk.

523
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,570
Right.

524
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:24,970
Looks like I'll have to take care of this myself.

525
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:31,990
hello.

526
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,240
Silver,how are you feeling?

527
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,400
I'm good,I think.

528
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,930
It's all a bit of a blur.

529
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:42,710
For some reason,I'm wearing a leather jacket over my pajamas.

530
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,050
is dixon taking good care of you,though?

531
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,730
Apparently.

532
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,730
Yeah,well,he must be really into you,girl,

533
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,220
'cause he really wanted to come to this dance.

534
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,140
He did?

535
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,080
Yeah,he really loves this stuff.

536
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,170
Anyway.

537
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,690
feel better.

538
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,340
Bye.

539
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,790
Oh,my god,you're here!

540
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:10,290
Oh,my god,you're here,too,and so am I!

541
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,280
See?I told you that'd work.

542
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,650
Yeah,there' still part of the plan to be enacted.

543
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,260
Are you saying you would like to dance with me?

544
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,060
I would.

545
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,490
So,my friend bet me 50 bucks that I couldn't get you to dance with me.

546
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,830
I'll split it with you.

547
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:52,320
I'll give you a hundred bucks to go away now.

548
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,810
Come on.You're standing alone on the dance floor.

549
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,680
Look around.

550
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:03,540
Naomi clark can't be the girl with two cups.

551
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,000
You better not touch my ass.

552
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,480
So maybe I was being ridiculous.

553
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,960
We should have just come together?

554
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,410
Oh,no,it's okay.

555
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,820
I had fun getting ready with naomi.

556
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,120
Cool,so,uh,what do you think of my dance moves?

557
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,160
Pretty sick,huh?

558
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,310
Oh,yes,I am stunned by your one move.

559
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:49,830
Oh,no,no,no,I have more than one move.

560
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,400
So how much longer are you in detention,anyway?

561
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,910
The rest of the semester.

562
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:00,940
Damn,girl,you were bad.

563
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,030
I was just in there for one day.

564
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,980
Maybe I can get some more time

565
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,420
if I go and steal your big face picture out in the hallway.

566
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,420
Um,creepy.

567
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:14,460
Tengo muchas esperanzas para nosotros.

568
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,710
Despacio,muchacho.

569
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,380
Vamos a tomarlo despacio.

570
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,820
A pasty white girl who speaks fluent spanish.

571
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,100
That's very sexy.

572
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,270
So,ah,I'll get us some drinks.

573
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,770
And I will get us snacks.

574
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,860
Annie,can we talk?

575
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,000
Sure.

576
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,270
Oh,my god.

577
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,470
Adrianna,hey.

578
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,140
How are you?

579
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,650
I've been bettertter.

580
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,840
Looks like a pretty fun party.

581
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,640
What are you doing here?

582
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,490
The gave me a night pass so I could come to homecoming.

583
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,240
It's not jail.

584
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,090
They let you come and go.

585
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:06,950
No,they don'T.

586
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,300
You're a liar.

587
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:11,070
You can't come and go out of rehab.

588
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,330
Naomi,can we go talk?

589
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,940
No,we can't talk because I'm not talking to you.

590
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,640
- Why not?
- Just go.

591
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,160
No!

592
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:25,110
No,I need you to tell me why,okay?

593
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,140
I have tried apologizing to you.

594
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,820
I have tried to tell you how sorry I am.

595
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,370
Please,I need you to tell me why and.

596
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,610
because it's too hard,adrianna.

597
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,450
I can't take it anymore I can't keep trying to save you

598
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,170
when you won't even try to save yourself.

599
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:49,430
I think it's easier if we just stop being friends because I can't take it.

600
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,930
I-I'm glad that you're okay.

601
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:58,170
I really am,but I can't keep watching you do this to yourself.

602
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,100
Not anymore.

603
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,720
This better be good stuff because I know the difference.

604
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,820
What do you got there,kimberly?

605
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,300
Geez,man,am I the only damn kid in this school?

606
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,150
Is there absolutely nobody else you can harass?

607
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,900
Not at the moment,sorry.

608
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,300
What are you doing with this,huh,kimberly?

609
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,360
What the hell are you doing with this stuff?

610
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,110
I guess I just get bored easily.

611
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,100
Why do you care?

612
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:23,880
Let's go.

613
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,480
Where to?

614
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,950
Just start walking.

615
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,900
The private investigator should have some information for us.

616
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:33,940
That's great.

617
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:35,250
I have to get back to the party.

618
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:38,660
Harry,you will never guess who I just ran into.

619
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,520
Tracy.

620
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,750
I'm so sorry I stole him away.

621
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,850
We were talking about our son.

622
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,330
We'll have to finish that later.

623
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,760
I am so sorry.

624
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,640
- She caught me in the hallway.
- This has to stop.

625
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:57,240
I am tired of smiling and pretending that everything is okay when it's not.

626
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,390
I know,I know,but she is a piece of work,and I don't know what to do.

627
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:04,700
I've been thinking,and her behavior makes me realize that I am right.

628
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,810
About what?

629
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:09,560
We need to tell the kids about your birth son sooner than later,harry.

630
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,250
Okay,yeah.

631
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:11,990
You're right.

632
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,650
I mean,I haven't told them 'cause I,I don't want to hurt them.

633
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,320
Yeah,well,it's gonna hurt a lot more if they hear it from someone else.

634
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,620
How do we know she hasn't told people?

635
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,520
Harry!

636
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,050
Need you.

637
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,700
Hey,can we finish this later?

638
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,770
I have to take care of something.

639
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,320
Yeah.

640
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,310
Me,too.

641
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,550
- Caught her buying drugs.
- Okay.

642
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,810
I will take these.

643
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,570
And?I'll take care of it.

644
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,970
- That's it?
- And you can go now.

645
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,890
No,I'm not going anywhere until you tell me exactly what is gonna happen.

646
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,090
Okay,she comes into my class.

647
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,770
ryan,I told you before to stay out of this.

648
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,960
Yeah,and maybe that's why the problem's getting worse,harry.

649
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,860
I got it covered.

650
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,970
- Really?You have it covered?
- Yeah.

651
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,620
That's why there's dogs running around sniffing lockers at school?

652
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,200
And you busted the wrong kid?

653
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,120
And now you've got kids buying drugs at dances.

654
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:00,900
Okay?

655
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:01,950
Please keep your voice down.

656
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,600
No,I'm not gonna keep my voice down,all right?

657
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,580
I'm tired of this crap.

658
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,540
You don't know how to deal with these kids,

659
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,870
and you don't know how to protect them,and I'm going to the board,

660
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,390
'cause you don't know what you're doing,okay?

661
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,450
And if they don't listen,I'm going to the L.A.Times.

662
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,390
Oh,for god's sakes.

663
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,720
I'm a cop,you dumbass.

664
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,690
What?

665
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,210
It's pretty intense.

666
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,090
Welcome to my life.

667
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,460
You don't think there's any way you could be friends with adrianna again?

668
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:09,610
Just like I said,it's too much drama,you know?

669
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:12,530
I just don't need that anymore.

670
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,360
It's why I like you.

671
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,560
You're so.

672
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,750
boring?

673
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,150
No,not at all.

674
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,920
Stable.

675
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,500
I really want to be your friend,annie.

676
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:27,340
I know I haven't acted like it,but I do.

677
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,650
I would really like that.

678
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,500
It's just this one thing.

679
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,630
Honestly.

680
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:43,740
I don't think we can be friends if you're with ethan.

681
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,060
Um,but you said at your house.

682
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:48,780
I know.

683
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,120
At my house,not here.

684
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:57,060
Watching you,him,both of you dancing together.

685
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,870
But you broke up with him.

686
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,750
I know,and I can't stop him from dating other people.

687
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,880
I know that,but it just can't be you.

688
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,580
Not if we're gonna be friends.

689
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,290
Friends tell each other everything,you know?

690
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,140
And if you're with ethan,

691
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,960
I'm not gonna want to hear about your first kiss

692
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,540
or going out on dates with him,you know?

693
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,980
These are things we're supposed to share together.

694
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:31,400
It's just,I mean,how would it feel if I went out with your ex?

695
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,180
It,it would be weird.

696
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:44,990
Annie,boyfriends come and go,but friends stick together.

697
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,430
Oh,do they?

698
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,990
Through everything?

699
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:48,830
That's different.

700
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:51,540
No,it doesn't have to be.

701
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,880
You don't know what it's like with adrianna.

702
00:34:54,940 --> 00:35:01,120
No,no,I-I don't,but if it hurts you this much to watch adrianna do this to herself,

703
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:06,010
then what are you gonna do if you really lose her?

704
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,870
What?

705
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:25,030
Don't sleep through your opportunity to take a chipmunk to homecoming.

706
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:27,340
For real?

707
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,840
For real.

708
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,230
I thought we hated homecoming?

709
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,880
Uh,I'm on to you.

710
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,620
Let's go.

711
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,040
All right.

712
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:42,600
Well,I gotta stop home and get my stuff,but.

713
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:46,490
but don't be afraid to tell me stuff,okay?

714
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,170
We don't have to agree on everything.

715
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,780
Hey,come on now.

716
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,310
Who said I was afraid?

717
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,280
I was just being nice.

718
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,320
Well,then don't be so nice.

719
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,350
Okay,I.

720
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:02,110
just shut up and kiss me.

721
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,680
That hurt.

722
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,930
We'll get some aspirin on the way.

723
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:17,100
Tracy,I want to be very clear on something.

724
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,820
Yes?

725
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:23,100
Just because you're on the parents board and I'm the principal's wife.

726
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:23,770
you know what,debbie?

727
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,160
I actually was gonna go talk to some people over there,

728
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:29,550
so would you mind just getting to the point?

729
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:35,250
If you ever kiss my husband again or touch him or look at him in the wrong way,

730
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,140
you and I will have a very big problem.

731
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:43,850
Gosh,I don't know how I would get through the day knowing that you were angry at me.

732
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,810
Let me define "big problem" just so we're clear.

733
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:52,770
I will hit you in the face so hard I will knock your teeth out.

734
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,970
You enjoy the rest of your evening,tracy.

735
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,850
I know I will.

736
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,510
Hey,eric.

737
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,190
Hey,adrianna.

738
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,090
How was your vacation?

739
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,280
It was very relaxing.

740
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,080
But I could get more relaxed.

741
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,600
All right then.

742
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,230
Get out!

743
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:20,870
Get out,adrianna!

744
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,590
Get out!

745
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,930
- What the hell are you doing?
- Get out!

746
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,900
Don't you ever sell to her again,you lowlife piece of crap,you hear me?

747
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:31,400
Control your woman,ade,or next time it's gonna get a lot worse.

748
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,350
Navid,are you okay?

749
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,730
Why are you doing this?

750
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,400
What do you mean,why am I doing this?

751
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:41,500
Because I want to,because it feels good.

752
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,000
Why are you doing this?

753
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,420
Are you blind?

754
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,230
You're always doing this,"woe is me" crap and how you have no friends,

755
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,890
and I'm sitting here right in front of you!

756
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,080
What are you talking about?

757
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:51,990
I like you,adrianna,okay?

758
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,490
I like you!

759
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,930
There I said it 'cause god knows you would have noticed.

760
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,700
Stop.

761
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,350
Stop it.

762
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,060
No,I've liked you since middle school.

763
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,130
When we were kids and we used to hang out

764
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,380
making those stupid versions of big movies together?

765
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,150
Don't do.

766
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,350
normal stuff.

767
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,270
I need you to stop.

768
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,490
No,I'm not gonna stop,okay?

769
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,470
I need you to stop.

770
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,590
Hey,I can't stop.

771
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,190
We used to be so close.

772
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,670
Then you got in the seventh grade and you got that sitcom

773
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:21,370
and it was like you don't even know me anymore.

774
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,630
But I never forgot you.

775
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,960
I never forgot who you used to be.

776
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,980
Who I used to be.

777
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,800
right.

778
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:43,470
Do you remember when I agreed to do lord of the rings.

779
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,310
so that you'd do a scene from princess diaries?

780
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,660
Do you remember that?

781
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,080
Yeah.

782
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:54,680
I would always do anything for you.

783
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,280
Oh,my god.

784
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:05,220
Did you pay to get me into currents?

785
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,670
Oh,my god.

786
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,340
Yeah,I did.

787
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,340
My dad did.

788
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:16,220
I just,uh,had to get him to do it.

789
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,230
Hey,hey,hey.

790
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,610
I just want you to get better,okay?

791
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,820
I want you to get back to who you used to be.

792
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,900
All right?

793
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:29,990
Adrianna.

794
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,230
Oh,I'm so sorry.

795
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,170
I am so sorry.

796
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,830
I know,I know.

797
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,540
I'm not gonna let you down,okay?

798
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,570
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

799
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,190
I'm gonna make sure nothing does.

800
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,440
I can't do this.

801
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,860
Can't do what?

802
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,050
I...

803
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:12,830
I can't do "us" to naomi.

804
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,760
I get where she's coming from,and I like her.

805
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,070
Do you like me?

806
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:20,040
What?

807
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,170
Do you like me?

808
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,030
Yeah,but.

809
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,610
Look,look,obviously,uh,this needs to be kept a secret.

810
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,140
This is very serious,very real.

811
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,980
I hope I didn't screw anything up.

812
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,170
You won't if you keep your mouth shut.

813
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:03,030
You know you can stop the whole sassy act now,right?

814
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,060
It's not an act.

815
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,980
How old are you anyway?

816
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,530
I'm 25-- why?
