00:00:01,305 --> 00:00:03,127
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:05,299
You've made mistakes,
I don't judge you.

3
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:08,300
- What are you talking about?
- You accidentally ran over my Uncle.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,176
I didn't know Joe myself.

5
00:00:10,426 --> 00:00:12,674
We're a band. All for one.
And all that crap.

6
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:15,552
We do it together
or we don't do it at all.

7
00:00:16,288 --> 00:00:18,680
- Hi. Laurel Cooper.
- You're a music producer?

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,392
- And I'm interested in signing you.
- I can't wait to tell the band.

9
00:00:22,652 --> 00:00:24,269
I'm not interested in the band.

10
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:25,979
I'm only interested in you.

11
00:00:27,782 --> 00:00:28,648
Mom!

12
00:00:29,494 --> 00:00:32,163
- I know you're still into Liam.
- What are you talking about?

13
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,446
- I'm with Dixon now.
- You're not really dating.

14
00:00:34,706 --> 00:00:37,407
You have no idea what
you're talking about

15
00:00:39,085 --> 00:00:41,505
- I'm kicking you off The Blaze.
- No! What do you want?

16
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:44,624
I'll do anything.
Please, I'll do anything.

17
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:47,329
- Are you offering to sleep with me?
- What?

18
00:00:48,394 --> 00:00:51,129
Because that would be
completely inappropriate.

19
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:52,719
You're off The Blaze.

20
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,924
I can't believe
you're taking his side.

21
00:00:55,575 --> 00:00:59,137
He said if I wanted back on The Blaze,
I had to sleep with him.

22
00:00:59,397 --> 00:01:00,397
What?!

23
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,684
- You're a piece of garbage.
- Did you hear about Liam?

24
00:01:04,854 --> 00:01:07,230
- Apparently he attacked Mr. Cannon.
- You can't do this.

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,066
- This doesn't concern you.
- Yes, it does. Liam did this because

26
00:01:11,483 --> 00:01:13,360
Mr. Cannon sexually harassed me.

27
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:27,040
Do I have to sign something?

28
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,692
Like, a contract?

29
00:01:28,862 --> 00:01:31,378
Yeah, but the lawyers
will get into all that.

30
00:01:31,638 --> 00:01:34,711
You and me, we'll
just focus on the music.

31
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:36,966
Sounds great.

32
00:01:40,937 --> 00:01:42,305
There's just one thing.

33
00:01:43,983 --> 00:01:47,006
I feel really
guilty about leaving the band.

34
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:50,313
Is there any reason why I can't
just play with them in my spare time?

35
00:01:50,573 --> 00:01:51,768
Spare time?

36
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:55,568
I don't think you fully grasp
where your life is heAded.

37
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:58,822
Cutting an album,
touring, promoting...

38
00:01:59,082 --> 00:02:01,259
Your plate is about
to get very full.

39
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:03,743
Especially if you insist on
sticking with High School.

40
00:02:05,004 --> 00:02:06,621
I'm just messing with you.

41
00:02:08,499 --> 00:02:09,513
Listen.

42
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,325
I'm throwing a party here
for some industry folks.

43
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:15,338
You should come. It'll give you
a taste of your new life.

44
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:17,632
My new life?

45
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:21,261
Once the touring starts,
you'll be out every night.

46
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:25,334
Sleeping in different cities, going
to the craziest parties in the world.

47
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:28,518
It's going to be an amazing ride.

48
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:40,214
Wish you could have seen that jellyfish.
It was bigger than my board.

49
00:02:40,384 --> 00:02:42,097
Stings like a bitch.

50
00:02:42,267 --> 00:02:43,106
I bet.

51
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:45,952
But did you have to pee on
your foot in front of those girls?

52
00:02:46,212 --> 00:02:48,049
You're right,
I should've let you do it.

53
00:02:50,773 --> 00:02:53,273
I know I owe you that money
to pay your dad's bookie...

54
00:02:53,443 --> 00:02:55,278
Whenever you get a chance.

55
00:02:56,017 --> 00:02:58,798
Could we hold off a bit? The
Lakers are playing San Antonio at home,

56
00:02:59,171 --> 00:03:02,552
and I know they're not going to lose.
Just want to put some real money on it.

57
00:03:03,514 --> 00:03:04,721
Not a problem.

58
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:09,815
There's my lady.

59
00:03:11,287 --> 00:03:12,817
How you doing, baby?

60
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,026
Got to go pee on my foot again.

61
00:03:18,286 --> 00:03:19,442
See you guys.

62
00:03:19,612 --> 00:03:20,865
Interesting.

63
00:03:22,113 --> 00:03:24,376
Homeboy definitely
got some quirks to him.

64
00:03:24,546 --> 00:03:25,701
No kidding.

65
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,770
Teddy's gone.

66
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:35,746
You plan on keeping
your arm around me all day

67
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,874
or you gonna let me go eat
my fries before they get soggy?

68
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,501
Later.

69
00:04:01,636 --> 00:04:03,279
I had a really good time tonight.

70
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:05,831
The night is just starting, baby.

71
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,613
Hi. Easy with the PDA.
Thanks.

72
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:23,921
Where were we?

73
00:04:29,076 --> 00:04:30,747
Chillax, my friend.

74
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:32,442
Ivy's a big girl.

75
00:04:49,698 --> 00:04:51,078
I'll see you later?

76
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:13,433
How's your piece coming?

77
00:05:13,693 --> 00:05:14,793
Not too bad.

78
00:05:17,758 --> 00:05:20,064
Things going well
with you and Adrianna?

79
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:25,840
Yeah.

80
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,822
Thanks for asking.

81
00:05:28,082 --> 00:05:30,491
Great. Excellent.
I'm glad to hear it.

82
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,807
It must be pretty tough
to get all this work done,

83
00:05:33,977 --> 00:05:35,935
now that you're in
a serious relationship.

84
00:05:36,105 --> 00:05:37,081
Not really.

85
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:39,334
Awesome.

86
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:44,482
Because relationships,
they can be so time-consuming.

87
00:05:45,155 --> 00:05:47,395
I always felt that way about Ade.

88
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:50,228
That is, before she
started dating you, of course.

89
00:05:50,398 --> 00:05:52,828
Those events
were completely unrelated.

90
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,190
Right?

91
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:58,561
Or were they related?

92
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:01,480
- I'm not really following.
- Did I make Adrianna gay?

93
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,792
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:07,212 --> 00:06:08,884
I didn't mean to laugh.

95
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:12,384
That's not really how it works.

96
00:06:12,551 --> 00:06:14,369
You didn't have
anything to do with it.

97
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:16,445
I didn't.

98
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,961
Adrianna just fell for me.

99
00:06:20,323 --> 00:06:22,293
People fall
for each other all the time.

100
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:25,138
Yeah, they do.

101
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:32,357
Not that I'm worried or anything.
I'm pretty confident with my skills.

102
00:06:33,618 --> 00:06:34,931
Between the sheets

103
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:36,191
Gotcha.

104
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:43,481
What I wanted to say is,
she's a really good person.

105
00:06:43,747 --> 00:06:45,608
Just make sure you take care of her.

106
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,428
I know she is.

107
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:49,962
I will.

108
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,956
I got to run to class.

109
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,203
See you later, champ.

110
00:07:05,182 --> 00:07:06,271
So,

111
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,634
you seemed pretty interested in
Gia and Ade's relationship.

112
00:07:10,804 --> 00:07:12,051
What's up with that?

113
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:14,349
That was just natural curiosity,

114
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,605
That's all.

115
00:07:16,756 --> 00:07:19,017
Are you sure that's all that was?

116
00:07:19,277 --> 00:07:20,877
What else would it be?

117
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,428
See you in a bit.

118
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,989
All right.
Keep your eyes open, Silver.

119
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,239
I'm looking for a
car that represents

120
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:37,035
a whole new chapter in my life.

121
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,928
Something that says freedom.
Thelma and Louise

122
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:42,238
minus the
driving off the cliff part.

123
00:07:42,408 --> 00:07:43,507
Something...

124
00:07:46,948 --> 00:07:48,056
Like that.

125
00:07:51,977 --> 00:07:53,648
Hello, gorgeous.

126
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:56,701
And the dream dies.

127
00:07:56,871 --> 00:07:59,550
The insurance money I got
won't even come close.

128
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,625
You could sell a kidney.

129
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:04,167
- Might be worth it.
- Yeah, maybe.

130
00:08:04,337 --> 00:08:07,755
At the very least, we
should take it for a joy ride.

131
00:08:07,925 --> 00:08:10,458
Keep my kidney and
get a small taste of freedom.

132
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:13,379
Best of both worlds.
She's a beauty, ain't she?

133
00:08:13,549 --> 00:08:15,948
Let me grab the keys.
I'd love to take you for a spin.

134
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,786
Actually, is there any way that
we could take it out ourselves?

135
00:08:20,047 --> 00:08:21,662
That's against company policy.

136
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,238
Next time you go car
shopping, bring a parent.

137
00:08:30,163 --> 00:08:31,631
So much for the joy ride.

138
00:08:35,758 --> 00:08:38,179
Would Thelma and Louise
take no for an answer?

139
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:42,203
I know how upset you must be.

140
00:08:43,132 --> 00:08:46,902
And I want you to know that I am
taking your accusations very seriously.

141
00:08:47,564 --> 00:08:50,788
I talked to the school board and there's
going to be a hearing in a few days.

142
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:52,238
What?

143
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,302
I don't want a hearing.

144
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:56,114
I don't want to press charges.

145
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,439
I'm the victim.
It's my choice, right?

146
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:00,785
No, it's not.

147
00:09:01,387 --> 00:09:03,672
Once a student raises these
concerns about a teacher,

148
00:09:03,842 --> 00:09:05,895
it becomes a public safety issue

149
00:09:06,065 --> 00:09:08,960
and that's why Mr. Cannon has been
put on paid leave until the hearing.

150
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:12,708
Principal Wilson...

151
00:09:13,718 --> 00:09:16,676
I'm serious. I just want to
call this whole thing off.

152
00:09:17,225 --> 00:09:20,346
- I don't think he's gonna do it again.
- We can't take that chance.

153
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,755
I know this is difficult for you.

154
00:09:25,053 --> 00:09:27,090
But you go in there,
you tell the truth,

155
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,771
and everything's gonna be fine.

<i>Another Another Chance</i>

158
00:09:57,831 --> 00:10:00,375
It's my mom.
Like, the fifth time today.

159
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:04,474
She just doesn't get it.
I'm never going back to that house.

160
00:10:04,644 --> 00:10:07,357
It's the last place in
the world I want to be.

161
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,071
I know this Mr. Cannon
thing is... Scary.

162
00:10:16,414 --> 00:10:18,370
But you don't have
anything to worry about.

163
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,955
I do have something
to worry about, Liam.

164
00:10:26,422 --> 00:10:28,398
There's something
I have to tell you.

165
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:30,932
We just heard.

166
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,501
Sleazebag.

167
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:34,997
- What did you hear?
- I swear, if I see Mr. Cannon,

168
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:38,549
you better hold me back. I may not look
like a bruiser but I can if need be.

169
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:41,695
- How did you hear about it?
- They were talking in history class.

170
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,141
What?!

171
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:46,265
You're doing the right thing.
Cannon is a jerk.

172
00:10:46,723 --> 00:10:48,618
I hope he never teaches again.

173
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:02,508
You okay?

174
00:11:03,322 --> 00:11:04,477
Not really.

175
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:06,953
I don't want to talk about it.

176
00:11:07,852 --> 00:11:08,988
Come on.

177
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,705
It's me here.
What's going on?

178
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:16,809
Don't say anything to anybody yet,

179
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,017
You know
that record producer Laurel?

180
00:11:19,293 --> 00:11:21,222
She wants to make an album with me.

181
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:24,262
So a huge record producer wants
to make your dreams come true?

182
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,598
Now I get the whole glum thing.

183
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:29,850
It means ditching the band.

184
00:11:32,017 --> 00:11:33,771
They'll probably be really upset.

185
00:11:36,194 --> 00:11:39,045
But the thing is I think
any one of them would jump on this

186
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:40,653
if they were in your shoes.

187
00:11:42,892 --> 00:11:43,948
Maybe.

188
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:45,950
But it's not just that.

189
00:11:46,566 --> 00:11:49,020
- What is it then?
- Navid, come on.

190
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,080
You of all people should know.

191
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:54,185
You didn't think I was ready
to get back into the acting thing.

192
00:11:54,355 --> 00:11:56,140
And as scary as that world is,

193
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,824
the music industry is
a hundred times worse.

194
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:02,627
I don't know if I can handle it.

195
00:12:03,392 --> 00:12:04,427
You can.

196
00:12:04,687 --> 00:12:07,471
Would the old Adrianna have
taken this decision so seriously?

197
00:12:08,754 --> 00:12:10,224
- Probably not.
- Exactly.

198
00:12:10,484 --> 00:12:13,538
The fact that you're thinking about it,
it's proof that you changed.

199
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:15,146
Thanks.

200
00:12:16,073 --> 00:12:18,703
Do you mind not mentioning
this to anybody yet?

201
00:12:18,873 --> 00:12:20,860
I kinda want to break it
to the band myself.

202
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,528
Sure, of course.

203
00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:29,160
The Blaze is gonna be way
less lame with your intro music.

204
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:31,429
Seriously, it sounds dope.

205
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:34,682
Thank you.
Deejaying is a passion of mine.

206
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:36,542
Show me how you do this.

207
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,197
Deejaying is
a very, very important job.

208
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:41,530
Is that true?

209
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,651
Say you're doing a party.

210
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,966
And there's a couple,

211
00:12:48,356 --> 00:12:49,764
and they're dancing.

212
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,705
And it's getting hotter
by the minute.

213
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:57,123
And they could be about to
have that very, very first kiss.

214
00:13:00,751 --> 00:13:02,723
If you play the wrong song...

215
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:06,286
You could ruin the whole moment.

216
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,428
I love Bob Marley!

217
00:13:12,728 --> 00:13:15,360
- I knew you had taste.
- There's something about his music.

218
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,854
You're bumming or sad about something,
you turn him on he cheers you up.

219
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:20,946
It's like flipping a switch.

220
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,758
Sorry to interrupt.
I though Naomi might be in here.

221
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:30,221
I'll see you guys later.

222
00:13:31,551 --> 00:13:32,870
Where were we?

223
00:13:34,573 --> 00:13:36,977
I just don't get what
he's doing with her.

224
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,138
It's like...
Open your eyes.

225
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:53,409
How the hell does Naomi
walk in these things?

226
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,352
Keep your eyes on the prize. We are
gonna take that car for a ride today.

227
00:13:57,522 --> 00:14:00,539
Hopefully before
I get strangled by my own boobs.

228
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,865
Explain to me again
why we're doing this.

229
00:14:03,035 --> 00:14:04,702
I had a hard year.

230
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:07,742
With Jasper and everything,
I just want something that signifies

231
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,684
a new beginning, freedom.

232
00:14:10,421 --> 00:14:12,167
I know this sounds crazy.

233
00:14:13,076 --> 00:14:15,896
You're gonna get your
Thelma & Louis freedom ride.

234
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:18,482
This push-up bra did not
get worn in vain.

235
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,397
Are you ladies
interested in a used car?

236
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:26,168
We prefer to call them
"previously owned automobiles."

237
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,105
My daddy said I can have
any car I want for my birthday,

238
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:31,424
and I want this one.

239
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:34,752
This is an excellent choice.
Let me go grab the keys for you.

240
00:14:34,922 --> 00:14:36,857
I'd be happy to take you ladies
for a spin.

241
00:14:37,027 --> 00:14:39,782
Actually, we were hoping
to sample the auto

242
00:14:39,952 --> 00:14:41,959
without dealer supervision.

243
00:14:42,736 --> 00:14:43,993
As in alone?

244
00:14:45,346 --> 00:14:48,215
- I'm sorry. It's against company...
- Company policy.

245
00:14:48,616 --> 00:14:49,626
No problem.

246
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:52,712
Let's go to that place
in Beverly hills.

247
00:14:52,882 --> 00:14:55,680
This cash is burning
a hole in my pocket.

248
00:14:56,686 --> 00:14:57,516
Ladies...

249
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:03,189
Let me go get the keys for you.

250
00:15:04,575 --> 00:15:05,862
You're too kind.

251
00:15:06,032 --> 00:15:07,359
The kindest.

252
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:24,826
Don't you love it?!
Don't you feel free?!

253
00:15:24,996 --> 00:15:26,745
I do. I feel free!

254
00:15:28,398 --> 00:15:31,177
And lost.
Do you have any idea where we are?

255
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:33,987
Actually, no.
No bet at all.

256
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,995
I guess we just keep driving
till we figure it out.

257
00:16:03,101 --> 00:16:04,453
Are you all right?

258
00:16:05,994 --> 00:16:07,260
I'm sorry.

259
00:16:08,046 --> 00:16:10,256
I just don't feel well
all of a sudden.

260
00:16:10,707 --> 00:16:12,198
Can we trade seats?

261
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:15,678
I don't think I can drive anymore.

262
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:17,707
Sure.

263
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:39,243
Why are you doing this?

264
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,332
You know nothing happened.

265
00:16:46,287 --> 00:16:47,376
I have a wife.

266
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:50,588
Why are you ruining my life?

267
00:16:54,537 --> 00:16:56,010
What the hell are you doing?

268
00:16:58,564 --> 00:16:59,524
Come on.

269
00:17:04,194 --> 00:17:06,415
Don't let that guy get in your head.

270
00:17:07,017 --> 00:17:09,245
- I'm ruining his life.
- No, you're not.

271
00:17:09,415 --> 00:17:11,736
He ruined his life
when he harassed you.

272
00:17:13,957 --> 00:17:15,458
I know this is hard,

273
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,114
but you can do it.

274
00:17:17,374 --> 00:17:18,944
I believe in you.

275
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:21,804
I'm here for you and
I love you and I know

276
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,858
that you're a strong person.
I promise you that when you get done...

277
00:17:26,477 --> 00:17:28,000
You just said you loved me.

278
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:31,395
I did...

279
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:34,043
And I do.

280
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:36,712
I love you, too.

281
00:17:46,142 --> 00:17:47,353
You can do this.

282
00:17:49,587 --> 00:17:52,592
I'm gonna be right here
waiting for you when it's over.

283
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:12,652
Unbelievable!

284
00:18:14,413 --> 00:18:16,298
I'm guessing
not a good unbelievable.

285
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:18,108
Adrianna quit the band.

286
00:18:18,278 --> 00:18:20,219
Can you believe she
screwed us like that?!

287
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:22,917
It sucks,
but it was a pretty big opportunity.

288
00:18:23,087 --> 00:18:25,933
It's not like she could've passed it up.
You'll find another singer.

289
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:27,562
Wait a minute.

290
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:28,977
You knew about this?

291
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,023
Why didn't you tell me?

292
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,485
I couldn't. Ade asked me
not to say anything.

293
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:41,657
I guess I know
where your loyalty lies.

294
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,426
Whatever.

295
00:18:45,663 --> 00:18:46,893
I'm out of here.

296
00:18:54,762 --> 00:18:57,506
As we all know,
these are very serious accusations,

297
00:19:01,115 --> 00:19:03,595
And we want to hear from
you both about what happened.

298
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:08,844
Naomi, why don't you start?

299
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,941
I went to Mr. Cannon's classroom

300
00:19:17,568 --> 00:19:19,557
'cause he wanted to speak to me,

301
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:21,822
and I was alone with him.

302
00:19:25,224 --> 00:19:26,034
And...

303
00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:29,832
And...

304
00:19:37,007 --> 00:19:38,380
Nothing happened.

305
00:19:39,906 --> 00:19:41,592
- I lied.
- What?

306
00:19:58,018 --> 00:19:59,777
I don't even know
what to say to you.

307
00:20:00,217 --> 00:20:02,596
You almost ruined that man's life.

308
00:20:04,124 --> 00:20:06,831
I'll talk to the school
board to determine your punishment,

309
00:20:07,001 --> 00:20:09,870
but trust me, there will
be severe consequences.

310
00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:14,672
I don't get it.

311
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,002
How could you do that?

312
00:20:18,501 --> 00:20:19,487
I just...

313
00:20:21,968 --> 00:20:23,996
Never thought it'd go this far.

314
00:20:58,897 --> 00:21:00,921
Go on.
Tell me you love me.

315
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,008
- What?
- Or wait for the news.

316
00:21:05,675 --> 00:21:06,635
What news?

317
00:21:06,905 --> 00:21:10,828
My mom is throwing one of those
big music industry parties at our house,

318
00:21:11,218 --> 00:21:12,651
and guess who

319
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:15,509
I convinced her
to hire as the deejay?

320
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:18,977
- You!
- Me?

321
00:21:20,287 --> 00:21:22,498
- A paid gig?
- A paid gig.

322
00:21:23,851 --> 00:21:24,818
For real?

323
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:26,015
Wait.

324
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:29,032
Your mom could hire anybody
that she wants. Why would she hire me?

325
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,029
It might've helped that I told her
you were one of the hottest new deejays

326
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:35,956
and that you just spun
Rob Pattinson's birthday party.

327
00:21:37,717 --> 00:21:39,719
I'm don't know where I
came up with that one.

328
00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:41,007
Thank you.

329
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,761
That was really cool of you.

330
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,567
- I owe you one.
- You do.

331
00:21:46,212 --> 00:21:49,428
And I was thinking What better
way to say thank you than to break up?

332
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,121
There is no way Liam's
gonna want to stay with Naomi

333
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,791
after lie-fest 2010,

334
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,015
so maybe I have a chance.

335
00:21:58,185 --> 00:22:00,147
So we kinda gotta speed up
the fake breakup.

336
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,762
I don't think that's a good idea.

337
00:22:06,175 --> 00:22:09,406
Who initiated the breakup? 'cause
I certainly don't want to be dumped.

338
00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:10,894
Neither do I.

339
00:22:14,715 --> 00:22:16,513
Fine, I'll be dumped.

340
00:22:16,854 --> 00:22:18,916
But don't say I was
clingy or anything.

341
00:22:19,413 --> 00:22:20,417
Say...

342
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:22,479
Say I had a wandering eye.

343
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,600
This stuff is top shelf.

344
00:22:35,551 --> 00:22:38,396
Got a guy who grows it
in his backyard in Topanga.

345
00:22:39,031 --> 00:22:40,469
I probably shouldn't.

346
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:42,537
I'm not going to tell on you.

347
00:22:44,248 --> 00:22:48,112
I'm one of those people who tends to get
a little carried away with that stuff.

348
00:22:48,282 --> 00:22:49,780
At least, I did.

349
00:22:51,734 --> 00:22:53,833
I had a bit of a problem
with it in college,

350
00:22:54,003 --> 00:22:57,454
and by bit of a problem, I mean
they used to call me "wake'n bake."

351
00:22:58,892 --> 00:23:01,749
So it's probably
best I don't start up again.

352
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,795
Suit yourself, wake'n bake.
It's all good.

353
00:23:06,794 --> 00:23:10,050
What if Ivy walks in?
She is my student.

354
00:23:12,132 --> 00:23:14,991
I taught Ivy to roll joints
for me when she was 13.

355
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:19,184
Don't worry.
She hates these industry soirees.

356
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:22,878
All right, what the hell.

357
00:23:24,235 --> 00:23:25,841
Don't say I didn't warn you.

358
00:23:33,656 --> 00:23:35,784
I am drowning in a sea of vintage.

359
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,316
I don't get it.

360
00:23:37,486 --> 00:23:40,790
When we talked, this professional
music thing wasn't a good idea.

361
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,318
- I thought you didn't wanna do it.
- I talked to Navid

362
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,419
and he made me feel a lot better.

363
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,731
Talked to Navid?

364
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:49,965
Why didn't you tell me that before?

365
00:23:50,225 --> 00:23:52,884
- I didn't think it was a big deal.
- Seems like a big deal

366
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:55,303
that you'd rather take your
ex-boyfriend's advice.

367
00:23:56,112 --> 00:23:57,347
Gia, come on.

368
00:23:57,609 --> 00:24:00,517
There's nothing going on
between me and Navid, I promise.

369
00:24:00,777 --> 00:24:02,811
He just knows me really well.

370
00:24:03,071 --> 00:24:05,824
- And I don't?
- Don't twist my words.

371
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:08,190
Gia, stop it.

372
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:11,445
You're the one I want to go
to the party with.

373
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:14,881
But,

374
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:17,409
I really don't think I should go.

375
00:24:18,005 --> 00:24:19,661
Because I talked to Navid?

376
00:24:20,332 --> 00:24:23,023
Not that. I have my
own sobriety to worry about.

377
00:24:23,193 --> 00:24:26,043
And I just don't think it's
a good idea to to go. For you or me.

378
00:24:26,515 --> 00:24:27,930
But I already told you that.

379
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,881
But apparently, you'd rather take
your ex-boyfriend's advice.

380
00:24:31,243 --> 00:24:34,217
'Cause he's not so judge-y.
He actually believes in me.

381
00:24:34,477 --> 00:24:37,471
- Great, then take him to the party.
- Maybe I will. It'll be more fun.

382
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,602
Screw you.

383
00:24:52,775 --> 00:24:55,119
I heard what happened with Naomi,

384
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:57,699
and I just want to say I'm sorry.

385
00:24:58,388 --> 00:24:59,317
Thanks.

386
00:25:01,602 --> 00:25:04,247
But at least now you know
what kind of person she is.

387
00:25:06,968 --> 00:25:08,696
What are you talking about?

388
00:25:09,398 --> 00:25:11,213
She's selfish and manipulative...

389
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:14,636
Whatever.

390
00:25:16,185 --> 00:25:17,621
It's over now.

391
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:20,639
- So at least you can move on.
- Move on with you?

392
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,582
Get it through your head, Ivy...

393
00:25:23,752 --> 00:25:25,227
We're never gonna happen.

394
00:25:47,205 --> 00:25:48,957
The cars, the cars...

395
00:25:49,127 --> 00:25:50,898
That was a band.

396
00:25:51,388 --> 00:25:55,170
Do you remember the video
where the guy was walking on water?

397
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,716
I was like, dude,

398
00:25:57,386 --> 00:25:59,053
you're totally walking on water.

399
00:25:59,223 --> 00:26:00,794
How did they do that?

400
00:26:03,275 --> 00:26:04,891
I'm really glad I met you.

401
00:26:05,424 --> 00:26:07,352
You're pretty fun
when you loosen up.

402
00:26:08,212 --> 00:26:10,579
Funny that you should
say loose, 'cause

403
00:26:11,701 --> 00:26:13,989
I'm feeling
a little loose, actually.

404
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,053
Particularly in the hip region.

405
00:26:16,223 --> 00:26:18,743
I don't know if you noticed
this was starting to happen.

406
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:21,271
A little shimmy.
Sometimes I do this move.

407
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:22,591
This happens.

408
00:26:22,946 --> 00:26:24,843
Or... A little shimmy.

409
00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:28,151
Maybe you want some Booty.
A little Booty right there? See that?

410
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:30,015
I do a little Booty.

411
00:26:30,368 --> 00:26:32,794
That looks just like
one of my students.

412
00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:40,701
Oh, my God, that's Dixon.

413
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,593
- What is he doing here?
- He's a friend of my daughter.

414
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,769
I hired him to deejay the party.

415
00:26:46,936 --> 00:26:50,562
Stop. No. He's my student.
This is terrible. This is a disaster.

416
00:26:51,233 --> 00:26:53,571
Don't get your panties
in a bunch, Ryan.

417
00:26:53,877 --> 00:26:55,131
My panties?

418
00:26:55,397 --> 00:26:57,328
My panties are very much
bunched right now.

419
00:26:57,495 --> 00:26:59,321
As they should be.
Why are you laughing?

420
00:27:02,146 --> 00:27:03,533
What is she doing here?

421
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,150
I'm representing her.

422
00:27:06,405 --> 00:27:09,129
- Don't wave.
- You should hear that girl sing.

423
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:13,113
I have, at school, where I teach.
What's wrong with you?

424
00:27:13,283 --> 00:27:16,713
Why wouldn't you tell me they were
coming when I asked you specifically?

425
00:27:17,507 --> 00:27:19,827
You only wanted to know
whether Ivy was coming.

426
00:27:19,997 --> 00:27:21,932
You didn't ask about anybody else.

427
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,834
You should have warned me.

428
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:25,404
I'm out of here.

429
00:27:36,194 --> 00:27:38,360
Hey, I got your text to come over.

430
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:40,445
What is all this?

431
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:43,156
It's our cotillion.

432
00:27:43,802 --> 00:27:45,533
I messed up when I was nine.

433
00:27:46,062 --> 00:27:48,935
And stepped on your foot
during the waltz.

434
00:27:50,792 --> 00:27:52,749
And you gave me another chance.

435
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:57,364
And I messed up again with Ade.

436
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,716
But, Lila, you should know
that my loyalty lies with you.

437
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,348
So,

438
00:28:04,995 --> 00:28:08,465
will you give me
another... another chance?

439
00:28:09,156 --> 00:28:11,348
I'll try not to mess up again.

440
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:45,649
Adrianna's first album is going
to be very ethereal.

441
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:48,406
Think Sia meets Inara George

442
00:28:48,576 --> 00:28:50,923
with a hint of Kate Nash
on a rainy day.

443
00:28:52,248 --> 00:28:53,061
Right?

444
00:28:57,342 --> 00:28:59,503
Anyway, sorry to steal her away,

445
00:28:59,673 --> 00:29:02,998
but there's a whole bunch
of people I need this girl to meet.

446
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,918
What's going on?

447
00:29:07,238 --> 00:29:09,763
You seem to be a little
elsewhere right now.

448
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:12,011
I'm fine.

449
00:29:12,455 --> 00:29:13,516
Come on.

450
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:20,462
I had a fight with my girlfriend.

451
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:24,581
It was pretty bad, and...
I think it was my fault.

452
00:29:26,078 --> 00:29:28,205
I don't know... I wasn't
being very sensitive,

453
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:30,638
and I really need to apologize.

454
00:29:32,024 --> 00:29:33,066
So,

455
00:29:33,853 --> 00:29:35,852
what the hell are you doing here?

456
00:29:36,112 --> 00:29:37,657
I thought I had to come.

457
00:29:37,827 --> 00:29:40,023
I thought this was
important for my career.

458
00:29:41,565 --> 00:29:43,189
Let me give you some advice.

459
00:29:46,457 --> 00:29:49,434
Not as a record producer,
but as your friend.

460
00:29:50,178 --> 00:29:51,887
Screw this party.

461
00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:53,411
Follow your heart.

462
00:29:53,671 --> 00:29:57,123
This industry is going to push you,
so you've got to push back.

463
00:29:57,383 --> 00:29:59,221
Don't let us make decisions for you.

464
00:29:59,391 --> 00:30:02,087
Otherwise, you'll be eaten up
and swallowed whole.

465
00:30:51,557 --> 00:30:53,929
- What are you doing here?
- I'm so sorry.

466
00:30:54,096 --> 00:30:57,063
I should have been more understanding
about how you felt about the party

467
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,691
and me going to the party.

468
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,384
I really think I can handle this.

469
00:31:03,063 --> 00:31:05,363
But I should have talked
that out with you, not Navid.

470
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:07,681
No kidding.

471
00:31:12,173 --> 00:31:14,773
- This isn't a good time.
- Gia, come on.

472
00:31:15,078 --> 00:31:17,167
I totally respect why
you didn't want to go,

473
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:20,434
and you don't ever have
to go if you don't want to.

474
00:31:21,573 --> 00:31:24,257
As long as you're there
for me when I get back.

475
00:31:36,075 --> 00:31:37,353
You cheated on me.

476
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,510
How could you do that?

477
00:31:40,677 --> 00:31:43,443
You were throwing your
relationship with Navid in my face.

478
00:31:44,144 --> 00:31:47,083
And I was upset and insecure and...

479
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:51,784
 I bumped into Alexa
and we started talking,

480
00:31:52,224 --> 00:31:53,774
and it just happened.

481
00:31:55,128 --> 00:31:56,539
I screwed up, okay?

482
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:59,066
And I'm really sorry.

483
00:32:01,077 --> 00:32:02,327
I'm sorry, too.

484
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:15,799
I don't know what to say.

485
00:32:16,503 --> 00:32:17,609
I screwed up

486
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,938
dozens of times in my life.

487
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:24,025
This, by far, is the
dumbest thing I've ever done.

488
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,535
And I regret it.

489
00:32:27,702 --> 00:32:29,739
You have no idea how
much I regret it.

490
00:32:30,998 --> 00:32:34,109
I was so angry at Mr. Cannon,
and no one was on my side,

491
00:32:34,276 --> 00:32:35,276
so I...

492
00:32:36,526 --> 00:32:37,580
 I made it up.

493
00:32:38,134 --> 00:32:39,748
It wasn't supposed to go anywhere,

494
00:32:39,915 --> 00:32:41,876
but then you found out
and you got so upset.

495
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,799
Before I could even come clean,

496
00:32:43,966 --> 00:32:46,551
things just got
completely out of control.

497
00:32:47,204 --> 00:32:48,132
Wait.

498
00:32:48,505 --> 00:32:51,155
- Where are you going?
- Back to my mom's.

499
00:32:51,859 --> 00:32:54,626
But you said that was the last
place in the world you wanted to be.

500
00:32:55,928 --> 00:32:57,684
I definitely don't want to be here.

501
00:33:17,071 --> 00:33:19,195
Thanks again for hooking
me up with this job.

502
00:33:19,362 --> 00:33:21,612
- Don't worry...
- It was so dope.

503
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:24,624
Seriously. Some
important-looking guy in a suit

504
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:26,337
even gave me his business card.

505
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
Rad.

506
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:31,080
Better believe I'm googling him
when I get home. 

507
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:36,308
- You okay?
- I don't really want to get into it.

508
00:33:36,544 --> 00:33:39,183
Come on. Otherwise, I'm going
to think it's something I did.

509
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,628
Well, it wasn't, so...

510
00:33:40,795 --> 00:33:43,559
You say that, but I'm gonna still
take it pretty personally.

511
00:33:44,174 --> 00:33:45,324
Despite my...

512
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:48,844
Roguish good looks and easy charm,

513
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:51,529
I'm still pretty insecure.

514
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:55,992
- Is that so?
- Yeah. Tragedy of my life.

515
00:33:57,537 --> 00:33:58,537
Come on.

516
00:33:59,876 --> 00:34:00,976
It's just...

517
00:34:02,157 --> 00:34:03,859
I saw Liam and...

518
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:07,177
I thought he'd be happy to see me,

519
00:34:07,344 --> 00:34:09,547
after everything that's
happened with Naomi,

520
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,340
but...

521
00:34:13,229 --> 00:34:14,229
nope.

522
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:16,763
That was a mistake.

523
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:19,998
He basically told me it
was never gonna happen.

524
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:22,367
Then he's an idiot.

525
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,479
Cause you're amazing, Ivy.

526
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,127
- You don't have to say that.
- I know I don't.

527
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,970
But, on a brighter note,
now I can actually move on

528
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:33,687
cause I am totally over that guy.

529
00:34:35,582 --> 00:34:37,033
I'm happy to hear that.

530
00:34:37,513 --> 00:34:39,015
- Thank you.
- No.

531
00:34:40,202 --> 00:34:41,746
I'm really happy to hear that.

532
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,723
Cause I like you, Ivy.

533
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,004
So...

534
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:54,989
Any chance you'll let
your fake ex-boyfriend

535
00:34:55,156 --> 00:34:56,594
take you out on a real date?

536
00:35:04,009 --> 00:35:05,895
Why not? Right?

537
00:35:07,077 --> 00:35:08,077
Cool.

538
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,356
Cool.

539
00:35:12,847 --> 00:35:15,347
Can I get a chai latte, please?
Thanks.

540
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:27,291
Excuse me. Shouldn't you be sharing
shopping tips with Lady Gaga right now?

541
00:35:27,854 --> 00:35:30,670
I left the party early.
I'm just writing a song.

542
00:35:32,795 --> 00:35:34,745
- What's it about?
- It's...

543
00:35:37,211 --> 00:35:39,262
It's kind of about being cheated on.

544
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,930
I just caught Gia with her ex.

545
00:35:53,122 --> 00:35:55,322
- I'm really sorry.
- It happens.

546
00:35:55,972 --> 00:35:57,772
It sucks, but you survive.

547
00:35:59,512 --> 00:36:00,700
You did, right?

548
00:36:05,124 --> 00:36:06,524
Yeah, you survive.

549
00:36:09,572 --> 00:36:10,460
What?

550
00:36:12,475 --> 00:36:14,775
Now, can I just say, though, that...

551
00:36:15,222 --> 00:36:16,591
I'm really proud of you.

552
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,551
Just seeing you here alone, drinking
your coffee, writing your songs...

553
00:36:20,718 --> 00:36:23,014
seems like such an undramatic
way to handle all this.

554
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,464
Which does prove my earlier point.

555
00:36:25,631 --> 00:36:27,031
You are different.

556
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,470
Now, you can handle all this.
Easy.

557
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:35,305
Do you want to sit and
have some coffee with me?

558
00:36:35,472 --> 00:36:38,070
Or on you on your way to see
the president or something?

559
00:36:40,597 --> 00:36:42,074
Obama can wait.

560
00:36:43,995 --> 00:36:45,995
Can I see what you're writing?

561
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,994
No judgments, though.
It's early. Okay?

562
00:36:49,161 --> 00:36:51,061
Okay. No judgments. Promise.

563
00:36:53,614 --> 00:36:54,964
What's the title?

564
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:02,608
You're still here?

565
00:37:05,828 --> 00:37:09,268
Couldn't exactly drive
home in my condition.

566
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:12,647
Hell, I couldn't even find my car.

567
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,762
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you in advance

568
00:37:24,929 --> 00:37:27,729
about Dixon and Adrianna
coming to the party.

569
00:37:28,023 --> 00:37:31,249
To be honest, I didn't...
I didn't even think about it.

570
00:37:32,113 --> 00:37:34,130
You need to understand
I'm not exactly

571
00:37:34,297 --> 00:37:37,284
a consequences
oriented kind of woman.

572
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:39,455
Never have been.

573
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:44,387
And if you don't want to hang out
with me because of that, I get it.

574
00:37:48,646 --> 00:37:49,846
I'm a big boy.

575
00:37:51,106 --> 00:37:52,937
And I don't need a babysitter.

576
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:55,898
Good. Cause I've never
been any good at that either.

577
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,945
Can I have some of that?

578
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:04,949
We salute you.

579
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:18,754
Dad?

580
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:26,934
- Wwhen did you get out?
- Not that long ago.

581
00:38:29,804 --> 00:38:31,058
Between you and me,

582
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:35,000
prison's not all
it's cracked up to be.

583
00:38:35,167 --> 00:38:38,608
As soon as I heard you're in California,
I took the first bus out here.

584
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:44,196
I missed you, kid.

585
00:38:55,797 --> 00:38:57,197
Look at you.

586
00:40:49,663 --> 00:40:51,115
I'm a terrible person.

587
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,180
You're not.

588
00:40:53,554 --> 00:40:54,554
I am.

589
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,044
I don't even know how this happened.

590
00:40:59,932 --> 00:41:01,282
I said one thing.

591
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:02,917
And it...

592
00:41:03,222 --> 00:41:06,076
spiraled completely out of control.

593
00:41:07,463 --> 00:41:08,513
And then...

594
00:41:09,215 --> 00:41:11,861
Before you could say
anything, or come forward,

595
00:41:12,955 --> 00:41:15,730
the secret just took
on a life of its own.

596
00:41:17,883 --> 00:41:21,283
And became this nightmare
that you couldn't wake up from.

597
00:41:24,044 --> 00:41:25,044
Trust me,

598
00:41:26,927 --> 00:41:27,978
I get it.

599
