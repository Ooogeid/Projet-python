1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:01,788
<i>Previously</i>...

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:04,964
That dude is gonna gave us a
serious leg up on the competition.

3
00:00:05,134 --> 00:00:07,836
That's not a dude
buddy. Ivy come here.

4
00:00:08,418 --> 00:00:10,926
What do you care who I make out with?
You got a boyfriend.

5
00:00:11,258 --> 00:00:12,543
Kiss whoever you want.

6
00:00:13,852 --> 00:00:14,968
We need to break up.

7
00:00:15,228 --> 00:00:18,221
Maybe for a while we just keep
our relationship on the down low?

8
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:19,481
Relationship?

9
00:00:19,648 --> 00:00:22,142
Noami will never believe
the we slept together.

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,228
I got talk to you.

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,400
I think it's best
that we just end things.

12
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:32,446
I'm pregnant.

13
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:48,015
I can't take it anymore.

14
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,126
I can't.

15
00:00:51,592 --> 00:00:53,179
I can't live like this.

16
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,144
God you're beautiful.

17
00:00:58,604 --> 00:01:00,096
- Shut up.
- You are,

18
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,385
you're a damn good actress too.

19
00:01:02,787 --> 00:01:05,602
I guess it's like, I looked
in your eyes, I see something.

20
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,940
Something, I don't know, full
of pain but it's definitely real.

21
00:01:11,108 --> 00:01:14,444
- It's probably because of my contacts.
- You shouldn't joke about your talent.

22
00:01:15,052 --> 00:01:17,447
Unless you think it's
all a joke? Me? My movie?

23
00:01:18,186 --> 00:01:19,199
Of course not.

24
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:21,912
I think your movie's amazing.

25
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,495
Honestly,

26
00:01:23,912 --> 00:01:26,042
you are increditably talented.

27
00:01:27,102 --> 00:01:28,583
I can't do it without you.

28
00:01:30,094 --> 00:01:31,532
You're my muse.

29
00:01:34,203 --> 00:01:35,518
Guys, get a room.

30
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:40,553
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:41,358 --> 00:01:44,102
I'm sorry. I didn't
realize there was a Blaze meeting.

32
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:47,095
I don't mean to kick you out,
if you wanna finish what you're doing.

33
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:50,789
We're leaving. Who are we to get in
the way of Woodward and Bernstein right?

34
00:01:55,632 --> 00:01:57,462
Blazers, listen up.

35
00:01:57,632 --> 00:02:00,029
I know that you're all excited
about the college edition

36
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:03,671
but I want to push in light of what just
happend, over at Malibu Canyon High.

37
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:07,309
I'm sure you guys already heard, but
a sophomore overdosed last weekend.

38
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:10,583
I wanna do a piece, about the abuse
of prescriptions drugs in high school.

39
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,331
- What do you think?
- Good story

40
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:14,875
but you just let
your best sources walked out the door.

41
00:02:15,258 --> 00:02:16,840
I have this ex-friend, Jenny.

42
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,901
She used to play soccer, she
was gonna be the next Mia Hamm

43
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:22,381
Now she's a total junkie, strung out,
screwed up.

44
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:24,201
The whole delightful package.

45
00:02:24,371 --> 00:02:25,849
Guess who her dealer is?

46
00:02:29,177 --> 00:02:31,121
- Are you sure?
- 100%.

47
00:02:40,388 --> 00:02:42,641
Those waves were sick this morning.

48
00:02:43,056 --> 00:02:44,861
I saw you wipe out at the end there

49
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,691
enjoy a nice Neptune's cocktail?

50
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:48,686
That was a serious wave.

51
00:02:48,856 --> 00:02:51,291
All I know it was at
least 3 inches high.

52
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:54,072
- You got a measuring stick?
- Yeah, in his pants.

53
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:57,790
- Suck it Sullivan.
- Whatever.

54
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,066
Seriously,
you were spitting up so much salt water

55
00:03:00,236 --> 00:03:02,594
I wanted to paddle over there and
burp you like a baby

56
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,280
3 inches, it was like...

57
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,255
Take a gander at
Mr. Krinsky's pants.

58
00:03:06,425 --> 00:03:08,558
His belt is,
like, nestled up into his armpit.

59
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,745
The idea that Mr. Krinsky
is married mystifies me.

60
00:03:13,915 --> 00:03:16,308
And his wife is hot! Saw the picture
on his desk.

61
00:03:16,475 --> 00:03:18,938
Unless, of course, the picture
came with the frame.

62
00:03:19,105 --> 00:03:20,972
I bet all the pictures
came with the frame.

63
00:03:21,142 --> 00:03:22,906
That golden retriever is so not his.

64
00:03:27,337 --> 00:03:29,162
Talking about spitting
up salt water...

65
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,208
- You're dead.
- I love this girl.

66
00:03:33,826 --> 00:03:35,001
What's up guys?

67
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,550
Sit, take a load of.

68
00:03:39,725 --> 00:03:42,342
- No I was just going to the Blaze.
- I'm outta here.

69
00:03:42,876 --> 00:03:46,387
I gotta go file a report in the PO
about my damaged tongue.

70
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,848
I guess I'll sit.

71
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:50,475
That was good.

72
00:03:50,735 --> 00:03:53,937
That was what? 10% less awkward
than the last Navid-Teddy encounter.

73
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:56,291
That guy is a tool, and a jerk.

74
00:03:57,617 --> 00:03:58,996
Doing alright?

75
00:03:59,163 --> 00:04:00,819
I'm fine.
Just working away,

76
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:02,612
a lot of homework, busy busy busy.

77
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:05,547
Especially if I stop for
a little moment

78
00:04:05,717 --> 00:04:08,493
I remember how my heart
broke up into thousands of piece.

79
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:10,203
Break-ups are the worst.

80
00:04:10,992 --> 00:04:11,996
Sorry, man.

81
00:04:13,591 --> 00:04:16,376
You're better off single.
Girls are nothing but trouble and drama.

82
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:20,611
Not you, you don't count,
you're not really a girl.

83
00:04:23,184 --> 00:04:24,618
Door's open.

84
00:04:28,532 --> 00:04:30,765
The picture of domesticity.

85
00:04:31,025 --> 00:04:32,764
Martha Stewart
better watch her back.

86
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:36,437
I'm younger, I'm cuter,
and I do not have a prison record.

87
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:38,857
You cooked a chicken?

88
00:04:40,272 --> 00:04:42,060
That is where she has the advantage.

89
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,280
In the cooking department,
I tried to cook a chicken.

90
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,563
We'll see.

91
00:04:47,224 --> 00:04:49,465
And, I rented

92
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:51,108
the "Maltese Falcon".

93
00:04:51,836 --> 00:04:53,787
So we can eat and then watch TV

94
00:04:53,957 --> 00:04:56,100
or we can eat while watching tv.

95
00:04:56,634 --> 00:04:58,626
I don't want to eat,
I just want to talk.

96
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:02,463
You're pregnant.

97
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,428
I know.

98
00:05:04,756 --> 00:05:06,812
You think that I don't know that?

99
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:09,762
I don't know.

100
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:11,883
You told me almost a week ago

101
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:14,644
and I've been here
almost every night.

102
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,395
And all we done is to
eat or watch television.

103
00:05:17,655 --> 00:05:20,273
- We haven't talked at all.
- I know.

104
00:05:20,635 --> 00:05:24,249
Sometimes all I want to do is,
is not thinking about it.

105
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:25,486
And be with you.

106
00:05:25,878 --> 00:05:26,995
Yeah, but

107
00:05:27,748 --> 00:05:29,532
there's no time left to talk.

108
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:33,244
There's a time
limit on things like this.

109
00:05:36,524 --> 00:05:37,790
Time limit? You mean...

110
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,586
Are you saying I
should get an abortion?

111
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,324
Let's just be real. I'm
a junior in high school...

112
00:05:47,353 --> 00:05:49,385
And you are a grown woman

113
00:05:49,645 --> 00:05:51,346
with a career and a life.

114
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:54,515
We're not even dating.

115
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,097
I'm gonna keep the baby.

116
00:05:57,264 --> 00:05:58,353
Our baby.

117
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,152
Is your school lunch safe?

118
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:10,703
How safe is your school lunch?

119
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,662
Your school lunch...

120
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:14,038
Is it safe...

121
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:15,954
or is it unsafe?

122
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,192
I'm sorry...

123
00:07:13,111 --> 00:07:14,429
Please.

124
00:07:17,613 --> 00:07:19,257
Please, forgive me.

125
00:07:25,927 --> 00:07:27,392
You cheated on me.

126
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,887
You broke up with me so
you could go out with Teddy.

127
00:07:30,057 --> 00:07:31,988
He doesn't
want to go out with you anymore?

128
00:07:32,906 --> 00:07:35,533
You come back to me
expecting me to take you back.

129
00:07:35,793 --> 00:07:38,890
And you weren't gonna tell me the truth.
You were gonna lie to me

130
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,997
and pretend like nothing
happened with him.

131
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,792
After I stood by you,
you treat me like this?

132
00:07:47,894 --> 00:07:48,918
I'm done.

133
00:08:03,088 --> 00:08:04,491
These bloody shoes!

134
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:06,357
And I mean that literally.

135
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:09,025
Male shoe designers
are absolute sadists.

136
00:08:09,887 --> 00:08:11,836
If you haven't walked
a mile in my shoes,

137
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:13,821
then you shouldn't
be designing them.

138
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:17,650
- I'm gonna put that on my gravestone.
- It's actually not a great...

139
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,411
Oh, my goodness,

140
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:22,413
there's...
a woman in your apartment.

141
00:08:23,032 --> 00:08:24,049
I know.

142
00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:27,293
This is Ramona.
Ramona, this is... Jen.

143
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:28,795
How you doing?

144
00:08:29,162 --> 00:08:30,243
I'm...

145
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,509
You... two are on a date.

146
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:36,788
How silly of me.

147
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,805
I'll just get out of your hair.

148
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:43,138
- Where did you two meet?
- I was his bartender

149
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:44,560
at the Silverlake.

150
00:08:46,012 --> 00:08:47,647
Silverlake, right.

151
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:50,358
Apparently, there's a
whole world east of La Brea.

152
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,052
I have to run.

153
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:55,801
You two have a lovely evening.

154
00:09:06,638 --> 00:09:09,210
Would you like some more
wine? Because I know I would.

155
00:09:17,212 --> 00:09:18,636
Hey, you guys...

156
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,347
Sorry I'm late... surf
practice ran long today.

157
00:09:21,786 --> 00:09:24,393
I don't see how that affects
you. Talked to your coach today.

158
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:27,061
He kicked you off
'cause you missed too many practices.

159
00:09:27,404 --> 00:09:28,438
Why is that?

160
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:34,125
- <i>Will you come? We need to talk!</i>
- Where were you?

161
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,298
- <i>I need you! I feel so alone</i>
- Answer your father.

162
00:09:37,465 --> 00:09:39,730
Put your phone down
when I'm talking to you.

163
00:09:43,807 --> 00:09:44,850
Fine!

164
00:09:46,243 --> 00:09:49,292
You guys want to know what's going on?
I got a girl pregnant.

165
00:09:55,605 --> 00:09:58,468

Season 02 episode 08
Women's Intuition

167
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,487
- Look...
- Don't.

168
00:10:17,934 --> 00:10:19,154
Don't talk.

169
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,694
I don't know what to say.

170
00:10:21,864 --> 00:10:24,619
You didn't just get a girl
pregnant, you got a woman pregnant.

171
00:10:25,118 --> 00:10:27,727
An adult woman you have
been secretly dating.

172
00:10:27,897 --> 00:10:29,132
You lied to her.

173
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:32,191
- You lied to us.
- I know. I screwed up. I get it.

174
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:34,089
Do you? Do you get it?

175
00:10:35,157 --> 00:10:38,135
Because if she has this baby,
you're gonna be a father.

176
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,389
You will have brought
a child into this world.

177
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,929
Your life
as you know it will be over.

178
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,683
That's not true.
Everything doesn't have to change.

179
00:10:48,636 --> 00:10:50,861
Dad had a kid
when he was a teenager.

180
00:10:55,262 --> 00:10:57,610
- I made a mistake.
- And so did I.

181
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:00,655
I don't even know how this happened.

182
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,282
We were safe almost every time.

183
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,801
Almost?

184
00:11:05,182 --> 00:11:07,514
You used
protection almost every time?

185
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:08,788
- Yeah...
- Don't...

186
00:11:11,052 --> 00:11:12,875
Don't you say another word.

187
00:11:20,942 --> 00:11:21,968
That her?

188
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,848
She says she's having cramps.

189
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,020
- I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
- Get your coat.

190
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:35,022
You're going over there.

191
00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:38,276
You came.

192
00:11:38,923 --> 00:11:41,237
- And you brought...
- His mother.

193
00:11:43,824 --> 00:11:45,950
Honestly I'm feeling much better.

194
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,200
I didn't mean to freak you guys out.

195
00:11:48,627 --> 00:11:51,778
The cramps are completely gone.
Maybe it was something I ate...

196
00:11:51,948 --> 00:11:53,964
You should just sit.

197
00:11:54,134 --> 00:11:56,384
If you give me the name of your doctor,
I'll just call

198
00:11:56,554 --> 00:11:59,005
make sure everything's okay.
Do you not have a doctor?

199
00:12:00,063 --> 00:12:02,085
It's Dr. Alderman.
But honestly, I'm fine.

200
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,893
You don't have to call. I think if I
get a little rest, I should be fine.

201
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:09,598
That's good. Mom, why
don't we just let Sasha rest?

202
00:12:11,235 --> 00:12:13,603
Of course,
and I'm glad that you're feeling better.

203
00:12:14,156 --> 00:12:16,397
If you don't mind me asking,
how far along are you?

204
00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:20,234
- A month.
- And you've been to your doctor?

205
00:12:21,502 --> 00:12:25,012
Totally. I did all the tests and the
whole sonogram and everything is great.

206
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,532
The baby looks great.

207
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:32,288
Dixon did mention that you
were thinking about keeping it.

208
00:12:32,548 --> 00:12:34,248
Are you sure about that decision?

209
00:12:36,651 --> 00:12:38,586
That really
isn't any of your business.

210
00:12:38,846 --> 00:12:40,210
I just want to discuss...

211
00:12:40,807 --> 00:12:43,136
What I do or don't do with this baby

212
00:12:43,306 --> 00:12:46,007
is a private matter
between me and Dixon.

213
00:12:48,772 --> 00:12:51,307
I need some rest.
And you need to leave.

214
00:12:57,412 --> 00:12:58,811
We'll talk later?

215
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:07,031
You take care of yourself, Sasha.

216
00:13:15,606 --> 00:13:16,791
Come here a minute.

217
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:20,506
Guess who got an honorable mention
in the city-wide essay contest?

218
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:22,566
You.

219
00:13:23,813 --> 00:13:26,092
They give everyone who
entered an honorable mention?

220
00:13:26,352 --> 00:13:28,636
They didn't.
It's a real accomplishment.

221
00:13:30,655 --> 00:13:32,997
I'm not saying you
just won the World Series of Poker,

222
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:34,433
but it's something.

223
00:13:36,507 --> 00:13:39,313
I'm not going to give you a high-five,
if that's what you're hoping.

224
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,656
- Quick. Nobody's looking.
- Get out of here.

225
00:13:41,823 --> 00:13:43,359
- Down low?
- You're a freak.

226
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:50,876
Nice.

227
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:53,289
You're getting better.
You got two in a row there.

228
00:13:53,545 --> 00:13:54,867
I'm learning.

229
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:58,085
You better back off, before
I learn with your nut sack.

230
00:13:58,252 --> 00:14:00,401
I almost forgot,
I heard back from my mom.

231
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:02,420
We are on the list
for the N.E.R.D. party.

232
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,589
- Can't wait. It's gonna be cool.
- My mom totally hooked us up.

233
00:14:05,849 --> 00:14:07,924
Hollywood parties aren't my thing.

234
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,626
I'll see you guys at the beach.

235
00:14:12,106 --> 00:14:13,354
Later.

236
00:14:21,597 --> 00:14:24,275
- I'll miss you.
- I'll call you when I'm on my way home.

237
00:14:30,141 --> 00:14:31,421
Can I talk to you?

238
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,743
Sure.

239
00:14:33,535 --> 00:14:36,719
This might be none of my business, but
I just heard something pretty messed up

240
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:38,997
and I want you to know right away.

241
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:41,000
Jasper's a drug dealer.

242
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,120
What?

243
00:14:43,311 --> 00:14:44,712
What are you talking about?

244
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,769
I have a friend whose
friend's dealer is Jasper.

245
00:14:47,936 --> 00:14:50,447
- Someone who knows someone.
- I know how it sounds,

246
00:14:50,617 --> 00:14:52,124
but my friend is trustworthy.

247
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,701
So am I. There's no
reason for me to lie.

248
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:58,851
I'm telling you this
because we used to be friends.

249
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:01,964
And I'm worried about you.

250
00:15:02,711 --> 00:15:03,731
Don't be.

251
00:15:13,223 --> 00:15:14,998
Can I get a French 75?

252
00:15:16,145 --> 00:15:17,495
You're Ryan's friend.

253
00:15:21,372 --> 00:15:22,374
Rachel?

254
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:23,959
Ramona.

255
00:15:24,312 --> 00:15:25,795
We met the other night, right?

256
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:28,526
How funny.
I found myself in the neighborhood,

257
00:15:28,696 --> 00:15:30,627
and I remembered
hearing about this place,

258
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:33,385
so I thought I'd come in
and check out the scene.

259
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:36,639
It's funny, I didn't recognize you.
You're much older looking close up.

260
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:41,065
Sorry. That didn't come out right.

261
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:44,396
That's all right. I guess I
could look pretty young from a distance.

262
00:15:46,985 --> 00:15:49,276
Could I get that French
75, or are you awfully busy?

263
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:52,655
Sorry.
We don't have any champagne.

264
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,987
Tell you what... sweetie, why
don't you just grab me a glass of water.

265
00:16:03,202 --> 00:16:04,774
Tell me about yourself.

266
00:16:04,944 --> 00:16:08,022
What are you... an aspiring actress?

267
00:16:09,253 --> 00:16:10,276
A model?

268
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,426
You're definitely not a model.

269
00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:17,211
Maybe you're a
singer-songwriter. That's it.

270
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:20,975
- You look like a singer-songwriter.
- I'm a bartender, actually.

271
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,936
Ryan is such a softy.

272
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,230
Why is that?

273
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,192
Just to take on
a charity case like you.

274
00:16:30,452 --> 00:16:31,764
Let's face it...

275
00:16:31,934 --> 00:16:34,780
You're not exactly the type
of woman he normally dates.

276
00:16:35,501 --> 00:16:36,532
He's so sweet.

277
00:16:37,818 --> 00:16:39,198
Don't you think so?

278
00:16:54,603 --> 00:16:57,192
What's going on? Why
weren't you at school today?

279
00:16:57,362 --> 00:16:59,310
'Cause I'm a terrible person.

280
00:17:00,382 --> 00:17:02,850
I ruined the best thing
that ever happened to me.

281
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,695
Navid hates me.

282
00:17:05,343 --> 00:17:07,972
I sang for him, and
he still rejected me.

283
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:10,169
You sang for him?

284
00:17:10,693 --> 00:17:13,360
I brought him my guitar,
and I serenaded him.

285
00:17:15,421 --> 00:17:16,864
That's special.

286
00:17:17,124 --> 00:17:19,950
I begged for his
forgiveness, and he said no.

287
00:17:23,081 --> 00:17:26,040
I'd do anything to make
my heart stop hurting.

288
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,388
Maybe for now...

289
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,088
You should go to a meeting.

290
00:17:33,348 --> 00:17:35,402
I just want the pain to stop.

291
00:17:40,522 --> 00:17:42,900
I got a hand nail this morning
and I took out my scissors,

292
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,914
and that's what I remembered.
I met Sasha at the nail salon.

293
00:17:46,084 --> 00:17:47,603
Who? A hand nail what?

294
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:52,441
That's a little coincidental.
I thought she looked familiar.

295
00:17:52,876 --> 00:17:55,203
Oh my God. I showed
her a picture of Dixon.

296
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:58,528
I bet they were already going out and
she acted as if she didn't know me.

297
00:17:58,698 --> 00:17:59,869
This girl is weird.

298
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,975
What kind of an adult would
date a high school student?

299
00:18:03,142 --> 00:18:06,606
Call it women's intuition, but I know
that there is something off about her.

300
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:09,791
It's how she acts toward Dixon,
the way she touched his arm

301
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:12,018
- when they already broken up.
- Touched his arm?

302
00:18:12,188 --> 00:18:14,743
And the sonogram. I didn't
even tell you about it.

303
00:18:14,913 --> 00:18:16,640
She's not pregnant.
She's lying.

304
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:18,014
Stop.

305
00:18:18,756 --> 00:18:20,302
I wish it weren't true, too.

306
00:18:21,656 --> 00:18:23,764
- It doesn't make any sense.
- I know.

307
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,342
- We need to talk to you.
- Sure.

308
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:40,703
Adrianna's not doing so well.

309
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,743
Adrianna's not my problem.

310
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,225
Just hear us out.
We went over to her place last night,

311
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,353
and she was sobbing and
out of it and...

312
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,420
We're worried she's going
to start using again.

313
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,740
We tried to get her to go to
a meeting, but she wouldn't go.

314
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,910
Will you ask her?

315
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,972
It's not my place anymore.

316
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,725
You might not be her boyfriend, but
you still care about her.

317
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:03,976
Please.

318
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,410
Can I have a word with you?

319
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,803
What the hell did you say to Ramona?

320
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,770
Ramona?
I'm sorry, I'm drawing a blank.

321
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,563
The girl at your apartment?

322
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,622
The one with the
greasy-looking kind of brown hair?

323
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,082
Did you tell her that
she was old looking,

324
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,878
and I was dating her out of charity?
What is wrong with you?

325
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,273
I have nothing against Ramona.

326
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,590
I barely met the girl, and
she seems perfectly nice.

327
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,387
She looks like she has
a great personality.

328
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,840
You're jealous.

329
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,243
Please. I am not jealous.

330
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:51,052
I am just not entirely comfortable
with you dating all these

331
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:54,283
random hipster-type girls
with pierced god-knows-whats.

332
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,150
- It's unbecoming.
- And you don't like it.

333
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,072
Fine, I don't like it.

334
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,433
- Who knows what diseases...
- Stop. Okay?

335
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,954
Admit that it's not fun
seeing me with other girls.

336
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,831
Fine. It's not.

337
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,502
Well, it's not fun watching you
date one trustafarian after another.

338
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,515
What are we going to do about it?

339
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:17,603
I'm not going to not
date other people

340
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,846
unless you're going to
not date other people.

341
00:20:20,013 --> 00:20:21,053
- Fine.
- Fine.

342
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,596
- Great.
- Perfect.

343
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,309
What is this? What's going on here?
Are we fighting, or dating?

344
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:30,480
It's both, I think.

345
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:34,873
- What?
- Are you going to kiss me?

346
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,280
- Fine.
- Fine.

347
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,813
I'm so excited.

348
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,229
Tonight I'm going to go back
up to the Hollywood sign

349
00:20:44,396 --> 00:20:46,538
to shoot some intervolometer
shots of the sunset.

350
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,758
I'm gonna intercut those
with Annie's daydream.

351
00:20:48,925 --> 00:20:50,818
God it's going to be good,
it really is.

352
00:20:50,985 --> 00:20:53,126
- Next.
- Could we get a regular chilI dog,

353
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:57,160
A Guadalajara dog and
a Swiss cheese with

354
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,730
- Pastrami?
- With Brooklyn pastrami.

355
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,347
That's a lot of money
to be carrying around.

356
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,500
Are you afraid I'm gonna get mugged?

357
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:11,070
Don't worry,
I can take care of myself.

358
00:21:12,223 --> 00:21:14,510
- Where'd it come from?
- Where?

359
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,263
Thank you. Uh, keep the change.

360
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,210
Wh-What do you want me to tell you?

361
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,633
Who I bank with? Or do
you want me to explain

362
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,893
the capitalist system
of symbolic currency?

363
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,473
Or maybe how trees turn into paper?

364
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,703
Are you a drug dealer?

365
00:21:29,336 --> 00:21:32,640
What? Why would you
even ask me that?

366
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,918
Navid... Navid Shirazi, he told
me that you were a drug dealer.

367
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,720
And you believed him?

368
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:42,063
- I don't know what to believe.
- God, I'm an idiot.

369
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,300
I thought you were
different than everyone else.

370
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,250
I thought it was you
and me against the world.

371
00:21:49,158 --> 00:21:50,800
You know what gets me?

372
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,404
Never once, when everybody
was calling you a slut,

373
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,732
when they were talking about you,

374
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,650
did I ever doubt you, did I ever
question your integrity.

375
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,600
Not once. And now you
hear one stupid rumor

376
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,230
and you lose all faith in me.
I just lost faith in you, okay?

377
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,000
- It's done.
- What?

378
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,403
It's done. I'm leaving, all right?

379
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:14,697
Bye-bye.

380
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:38,482
Dude, what the heck?
You can't just come in here...

381
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,503
- Ready to party?
- Grab that jacket.

382
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,727
We don't care if you don't like
Hollywood parties.

383
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,434
You're coming with us.

384
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,809
- Are you wearing a dress?
- It's not a big deal.

385
00:22:47,976 --> 00:22:49,902
My mom told me to get
dressed up, so I did.

386
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:51,994
Oh, my God, you've got
perfume on, don't you?

387
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:55,363
- I can smell you from here.
- No, I don't have perfume on, dude.

388
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,458
It's scented body lotion.

389
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,090
- Whatever. Can we go?
- Let's go.

390
00:23:35,995 --> 00:23:38,143
- How are you?
- I'm good. It's been ages!

391
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,680
- I know. What's up?
- Here you are.

392
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,664
I want you to meet Ryan.

393
00:23:43,831 --> 00:23:45,743
What's going on?
Nice to meet you.

394
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,654
- My boyfriend.
- Okay. Congrats.

395
00:23:48,821 --> 00:23:52,825
Listen, I want to introduce you
to our guys, too. Chad, this is Ryan.

396
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,101
- How you doing, man?
- What's up, brother?

397
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:57,790
This is Rhea.

398
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,979
- How are you?
- And that's Shay.

399
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:03,223
- Hey, man. Want me to do the...
- No, no. It's good like that.

400
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:06,013
So, we got to go set up,
but it was really nice to meet you.

401
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,725
- You, too, man. Big fan.
- I'm gonna see you around.

402
00:24:08,892 --> 00:24:10,242
Have a good show.

403
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,020
- I just met Pharrell.
- You did.

404
00:24:16,091 --> 00:24:19,456
I want you to meet somebody.
You introduce me to cool musicians,

405
00:24:19,623 --> 00:24:22,757
and I will introduce you to high school
students. How's that sound?

406
00:24:22,924 --> 00:24:24,428
- Great.
- Come here a minute.

407
00:24:24,595 --> 00:24:28,173
This kid's pretty special. I want you to
meet Liam, one of my favorite students,

408
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,510
and Liam, this is Jen,
my girlfriend.

409
00:24:31,831 --> 00:24:34,533
We've met before.
Where was that?

410
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,124
I think it was at a party, right?

411
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,830
I got to go.

412
00:24:43,391 --> 00:24:46,849
- Sorry. I don't know what that was.
- Don't worry about me.

413
00:24:47,016 --> 00:24:49,923
Is he okay?
He seems... troubled.

414
00:24:50,177 --> 00:24:52,903
I guess he is a little troubled.

415
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,130
He's had some anger issues in
the past. I just thought I was...

416
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,713
I don't know, getting
through to him or something.

417
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,800
You are an amazing teacher.

418
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:05,820
And if anyone can reach
a kid like that, it's you.

419
00:25:22,413 --> 00:25:23,413
You okay?

420
00:25:26,181 --> 00:25:27,231
Not really.

421
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:31,040
All I can think about
is how I screwed up.

422
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,013
I'm so, so, so sorry.

423
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:38,184
NaomI and Silver, they think
you might start using again.

424
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:42,144
I really think that you
should go to a meeting.

425
00:25:42,487 --> 00:25:43,875
Will you go with me?

426
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,550
- It's not my place.
- Oh, my God.

427
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,703
I'm not your person anymore.

428
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,120
- I can't take this.
- I can't be.

429
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:58,930
You have people. You have friends.

430
00:26:01,511 --> 00:26:03,011
It's up to you, Ade.

431
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:15,071
Dude, I cannot believe it. So you
snuck into Madison Square Garden?

432
00:26:15,238 --> 00:26:17,833
- That is awesome.
- Tickets are expensive.

433
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,554
So, anyway, we were going through
this tunnel. And it's, like,

434
00:26:20,721 --> 00:26:23,206
itch black inside
and when we come up, we're...

435
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,940
We're, like,
two feet from the stage.

436
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,740
Whatever. It was cool.

437
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,444
You guys want something to drink?

438
00:26:36,066 --> 00:26:37,216
Sure. Thanks.

439
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,590
What's up with Liam
and Malibu Barbie?

440
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:46,979
To make a long story short,
they used to go out, ended badly.

441
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:51,354
She's over him. He says
he's over her, but who knows?

442
00:26:51,521 --> 00:26:53,402
Maybe you could help
him get over her.

443
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,613
What do you mean? Why? Why me?

444
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:58,616
I don't know. Cause you
have a huge crush on him.

445
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:01,243
- You dragged him here to the party.
- Whatever.

446
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:04,177
Come on. You're wearing heels
and, like, three gallons of perfume.

447
00:27:04,344 --> 00:27:08,348
First of all, it's scented body lotion.
And, no, I do not have a crush on him.

448
00:27:14,578 --> 00:27:16,968
So, that was kind of awkward.

449
00:27:18,668 --> 00:27:21,969
We're bound to
run into each other now,

450
00:27:22,136 --> 00:27:24,686
and I want things to
be okay between us.

451
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,470
You're scared of me.

452
00:27:30,695 --> 00:27:31,733
Of you?

453
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,626
You're afraid I might tell
Matthews what happened that night.

454
00:27:34,793 --> 00:27:36,071
You're crazy.

455
00:27:38,952 --> 00:27:41,993
If you weren't scared, you
wouldn't be talking to me.

456
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,620
More coffee?

457
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,920
What a coincidence!

458
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:04,770
By the way, I realized I met you
at the nail salon. Remember?

459
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,394
Oh, my God. Right. Right.

460
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,648
Imagine running into
each other like that

461
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:13,533
when you were secretly dating my son.
Now, that was a coincidence.

462
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,240
Especially since you didn't
remember me afterwards.

463
00:28:19,123 --> 00:28:22,409
I did remember you,
and it wasn't a coincidence.

464
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,580
I followed you to the nail
salon because somehow,

465
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,703
I knew that Dixon wasn't telling
me the truth, which he wasn't.

466
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:33,712
And so, there, with you,
that is when I found out that Dixon

467
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,589
was in high school.

468
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,384
And, Mrs. Wilson, I was devastated.

469
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,580
Call me Debbie.

470
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:45,038
Okay.

471
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:50,074
You know, you... really shouldn't be
drinking coffee when you're pregnant.

472
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,943
Oh, no, I know. I'm going to stop.

473
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,053
It's hard to quit.
Believe me, I remember.

474
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,273
All of these things
are suddenly off-limits.

475
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,460
You should really
get a list from your doctor.

476
00:29:00,627 --> 00:29:03,380
By the way, which Dr. Alderman
are you seeing?

477
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:07,670
- Is it Karen Alderman or Ross Alderman?
- It's Karen.

478
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,665
Now, that is a coincidence.
Karen Alderman is a friend of mine.

479
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,292
No kidding?

480
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,711
I'm gonna tell her
to take very good care of you.

481
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,107
You don't have to...

482
00:29:16,274 --> 00:29:19,274
- Really, I want to.
- No, I'd rather you didn't.

483
00:29:21,361 --> 00:29:22,361
Okay.

484
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,490
So, tell me about the sonogram.

485
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,689
It's just amazing when you hear that
heartbeat for the first time, isn't it?

486
00:29:32,713 --> 00:29:34,540
It was totally amazing.

487
00:29:36,634 --> 00:29:40,638
It's particularly amazing since you
can't hear the heartbeat until week six.

488
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,491
- What?
- I'll give you a hint.

489
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,660
It starts with,"You're
not pregnant,"

490
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:52,122
and it ends with,
"Stay away from my son."

491
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,910
Enjoy your coffee, Sasha.

492
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,770
What are you doing here?

493
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,883
I believe you.

494
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,083
And I believe in you.

495
00:30:59,683 --> 00:31:02,734
I'm so sorry, Jasper.
I shouldn't have listened to them.

496
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,572
I mean, of course you're
not a drug dealer.

497
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:07,853
I should have known
better than that, and...

498
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,827
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

499
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:18,084
It's me... it's me and you
against the world. Right?

500
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,700
Come here.

501
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,200
Okay, but just...

502
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:46,090
Don't ever doubt me again.

503
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,600
I won't.

504
00:31:48,081 --> 00:31:49,654
I won't.

505
00:32:07,611 --> 00:32:09,636
Ade just texted me.
She's coming to the party.

506
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,012
Good. Maybe she's
starting to snap out of it.

507
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,932
I'm going to go check out
the music. Find me later.

508
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:32,176
- You just get here?
- I'm gonna get something to eat.

509
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,933
Navid, listen,

510
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,663
I'm really sorry about what
happened between me and Adrianna.

511
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,325
And I was a jerk.

512
00:33:38,492 --> 00:33:40,933
I really don't know what else
to say, other than I thought

513
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,570
you were just like
some guy I didn't know.

514
00:33:43,737 --> 00:33:46,898
And now, well, you're
not. I'm really sorry.

515
00:33:47,512 --> 00:33:48,827
You told me.

516
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,719
You were straight with me about what
happened. I appreciate that, at least.

517
00:33:52,886 --> 00:33:55,536
I'm gonna get something
to eat, all right?

518
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,541
- Navid, what's up?
- How's it going, man?

519
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:02,893
All right. The party's not bad.
For a Hollywood thing.

520
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,860
Good to see you.

521
00:34:05,027 --> 00:34:07,544
The girls are pretty cute.
You should go talk to 'em.

522
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,080
Not right now.

523
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,700
You should go for it.
They're pretty cute.

524
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:15,970
- No, I don't... I don't know.
- Come on, man. You can do it.

525
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:18,597
Go!
Go on. Just do it.

526
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:22,370
- Go!
- Okay, enough! Enough already! Man!?

527
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,540
- Are you serious?
- Go!

528
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,870
Glad you made it out.

529
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,530
Good for you.

530
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,580
So, you having fun?

531
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,480
Not really.

532
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,390
That's okay. At least you're trying.

533
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,743
Dealing with a cancer
patient can be really intense.

534
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:01,510
Can we talk about
something not cancer related?

535
00:35:02,322 --> 00:35:03,322
Sure.

536
00:35:06,034 --> 00:35:08,690
I'm using new hair
product in my locks.

537
00:35:09,561 --> 00:35:10,984
What do you think?

538
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,860
It leaves my hair manageable
yet, you know, touchably soft.

539
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,531
- Really?
- Go on, touch it.

540
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,750
Excuse me.

541
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,430
Whoop. Sorry.

542
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,343
There you are.
I got you some chicken satay.

543
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,583
I had to do some vicious
things to procure it. I'm...

544
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:51,500
I'm not proud. Actually,
I'm a little proud. I feel kinda manly.

545
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,890
What's wrong?

546
00:35:56,326 --> 00:35:59,614
Look, I'm sure Liam is a good kid.

547
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:04,034
I'm sure you're right, Ryan.
He's just... self-destructive.

548
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,243
What do you mean, self-destructive?
What happened?

549
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:10,603
When I met him before at this party,

550
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,643
he propositioned me.

551
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:16,250
But I didn't think I needed to
tell you about it until now...

552
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,673
- because now it happened again.
- What?

553
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,060
I was walking to
the bathroom and, well,

554
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:26,183
basically, Liam suggested
that he follow me in.

555
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,810
Are you kidding me?

556
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:31,033
He's just a troubled kid...

557
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:33,531
It's unbelievable.
You try to reach out to somebody,

558
00:36:33,698 --> 00:36:36,553
- you try to be their teacher, and...
- Hey, stop.

559
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,360
He doesn't deserve you.

560
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:42,200
But there are plenty of
other amazing kids who do.

561
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,110
Dixon, you in there?

562
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,340
What's going on?

563
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,830
Dixon, are you okay?

564
00:37:00,604 --> 00:37:01,754
Sasha called.

565
00:37:04,594 --> 00:37:05,973
She had a miscarriage.

566
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:09,730
She lost the baby, and she
doesn't want to see me anymore.

567
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:12,605
I don't know what to
think or what to feel.

568
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,670
I feel relieved...

569
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,400
I feel guilty

570
00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:19,567
and sad.

571
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,031
I really just don't
know what to feel.

572
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,459
- We have something that...
- You're gonna be okay.

573
00:37:24,626 --> 00:37:26,040
That we need to tell you

574
00:37:26,627 --> 00:37:28,157
These things happen.

575
00:37:28,337 --> 00:37:32,207
And it's hard, but if you
learn from this mistake,

576
00:37:32,707 --> 00:37:34,502
you're gonna be okay.

577
00:37:47,414 --> 00:37:48,414
Sorry.

578
00:37:50,459 --> 00:37:53,229
Look, I'm sorry I stormed
off like that before.

579
00:37:53,587 --> 00:37:56,027
That's what you're sorry about?

580
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,497
You don't want to apologize for the
fact that you just hit on my girlfriend?

581
00:37:59,707 --> 00:38:02,677
- What?
- What the hell's wrong with you?

582
00:38:15,437 --> 00:38:18,207
What was that, Deb? You lied to him.

583
00:38:18,527 --> 00:38:22,300
I know. I just couldn't
bear the look on his face

584
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,310
if he found out she was lying.

585
00:38:24,477 --> 00:38:27,677
It would hurt him too much.
It would break his heart.

586
00:38:27,947 --> 00:38:29,127
I don't know.

587
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:32,685
You have to trust me.

588
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,035
Sometimes, you have to trust me.

589
00:38:45,087 --> 00:38:47,017
Forgot your swag.

590
00:38:51,127 --> 00:38:54,587
Bath salts, a key chain.

591
00:38:54,777 --> 00:38:57,080
- They put anything good in here?
- A chocolate bar.

592
00:38:57,247 --> 00:38:59,497
I scarfed yours down
on the drive over.

593
00:39:00,227 --> 00:39:01,227
Nice.

594
00:39:02,617 --> 00:39:04,260
I saw you leave the party.

595
00:39:04,427 --> 00:39:06,810
You kinda just like
looked upset or something.

596
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:09,357
- You all right?
- I'm okay.

597
00:39:10,317 --> 00:39:11,867
What happened?

598
00:39:12,077 --> 00:39:14,817
Nothing.
Matthews just pissed me off.

599
00:39:15,037 --> 00:39:16,737
You want to talk about it?

600
00:39:19,214 --> 00:39:20,942
You want me to go?

601
00:39:27,007 --> 00:39:29,197
So, what's under the tarp?

602
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:31,202
Nothing. It's private.

603
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:33,727
Tell me it's not Mr. Matthews.

604
00:39:34,317 --> 00:39:37,657
So, glad you lost that
getup. What was with that, anyway?

605
00:39:37,824 --> 00:39:40,625
Like, every once in a while,
it's kinda nice to remind people I'm not

606
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:44,207
- actually a dude.
- Nobody thinks you're a dude.

607
00:39:46,376 --> 00:39:48,552
- Sometimes you do.
- Me? No, I don't.

608
00:40:05,421 --> 00:40:07,617
I don't want anything serious.

609
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:11,450
"Serious"? What are you, a girl?

610
00:40:28,161 --> 00:40:31,846
- I'm sorry that the sun went down.
- You're sorry? It's not your fault.

611
00:40:32,377 --> 00:40:34,937
But your sunset footage...

612
00:40:36,437 --> 00:40:38,597
I'm gonna get some
film from the car...

613
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,479
works at night. Be right back.

614
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,597
- Okay, don't be long.
- I promise.

615
00:41:09,728 --> 00:41:10,828
Here you go.

616
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:13,739
Thank you.
