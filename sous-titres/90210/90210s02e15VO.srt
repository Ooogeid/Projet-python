1
00:00:00,404 --> 00:00:02,330
<i>Previously on 90210...</i>

2
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:06,756
Why'd you do that?

3
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:09,087
You helped me out,
I wanted to help you.

4
00:00:09,347 --> 00:00:11,352
It was harder
to track down than I expected.

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,675
- Is this a threat?
- You wanna get back together?

6
00:00:14,936 --> 00:00:16,225
I like you a lot,

7
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:18,972
and I want to trust you,
but I don't.

8
00:00:19,593 --> 00:00:20,993
What do we do now?

9
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,941
- It's time to see my birth mom.
- <i>Dixon, who's there?</i>

10
00:00:25,488 --> 00:00:28,274
Hi. I'm Dana.
I'm Dixon's birth mom.

11
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:01,692
Harry, this Dana Bowen.

12
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,633
I'm sorry. I should've called.

13
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,645
Don't be silly.
We're really glad that you're here.

14
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:08,550
Really, really glad.

15
00:01:11,492 --> 00:01:13,068
Would you like to have a seat?

16
00:01:13,393 --> 00:01:14,402
Thank you.

17
00:01:16,738 --> 00:01:19,378
It's just that, Dixon e-mailed me,

18
00:01:19,548 --> 00:01:21,795
and he said he wanted
to come to Phoenix for a visit.

19
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,912
I kept trying to write back, and

20
00:01:24,172 --> 00:01:26,228
I must've started a dozen e-mails.

21
00:01:26,398 --> 00:01:28,208
And then I thought
maybe I should call.

22
00:01:28,468 --> 00:01:30,249
But the truth was,

23
00:01:30,582 --> 00:01:33,421
everything I wanted to say
just seemed better in person, so

24
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:36,466
I jumped in the car, and, here I am.

25
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:40,169
Way better than a phone call.

26
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,107
What are you doing here?

27
00:01:52,532 --> 00:01:53,858
You two know each other?

28
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:05,309
Last year, we headed down to Phoenix

29
00:02:05,476 --> 00:02:07,914
for spring break when we were
supposed to be at Grandma's.

30
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,582
You what?

31
00:02:09,842 --> 00:02:12,168
I'm sorry.
I had no idea you didn't know.

32
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,130
We didn't tell you because
we didn't want you to be upset.

33
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:19,011
When we got to Phoenix,

34
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:22,359
I couldn't even do it.
I couldn't even get out of the car.

35
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,286
I wasn't ready, I guess.

36
00:02:26,877 --> 00:02:28,389
But now I am,

37
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,092
and here you are, and...

38
00:02:31,262 --> 00:02:32,230
This is great.

39
00:02:36,926 --> 00:02:38,236
I am sorry to intrude.

40
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:41,634
I passed a hotel on the way here,
so I'm gonna stay there...

41
00:02:41,804 --> 00:02:44,072
You can stay here with us.
Right, Mom? Right, Dad?

42
00:02:44,242 --> 00:02:45,262
Absolutely.

43
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,354
We would love that.

44
00:02:56,587 --> 00:03:00,372
So, are you the kind of vegetarian
that will occasionally eat Kobe beef?

45
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:01,676
Not so much.

46
00:03:02,155 --> 00:03:03,136
Rack of lamb.

47
00:03:03,306 --> 00:03:05,323
It's okay if we can't share a meal.

48
00:03:05,493 --> 00:03:08,767
We have to share. That is the
whole point of being in a relationship.

49
00:03:09,027 --> 00:03:11,107
Try two dishes
when you go out to restaurants.

50
00:03:11,277 --> 00:03:13,021
Yeah, that is the whole point.

51
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:22,030
Of course if you dated them,
you could try three dishes.

52
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:24,061
Two is plenty.

53
00:03:24,964 --> 00:03:27,410
You pick.
Anything but the vegetable medley.

54
00:03:37,065 --> 00:03:38,525
Sorry about that.

55
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:41,090
- This girl programmed it in...
- I get it.

56
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:45,567
What can I get for you two?

57
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:53,937
Chloe, remember?

58
00:03:54,897 --> 00:03:56,439
- I do.
- Long time, no see.

59
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:58,149
Yeah. It's nice to see you.

60
00:04:00,468 --> 00:04:02,412
So, do you know what you want?

61
00:04:02,794 --> 00:04:05,156
I think
I'll have the vegetable medley.

62
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:09,994
Okay, everybody, dig in.

63
00:04:11,403 --> 00:04:13,748
Actually, would you mind
if we say grace?

64
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,085
Of course.
That would be great.

65
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:19,462
- Who wants to...?
- I will.

66
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:21,793
Great. Terrific.

67
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,560
For what we are about to receive,

68
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,241
may the Lord make us truly thankful,

69
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,766
and may we always be mindful
of the needs of others.

70
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:40,757
Haven't said that in a while,
but it just came right back.

71
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:43,862
- We must have said it every night.
- Most nights.

72
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,030
Would you pass the salad, please?

73
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:47,856
Sure.

74
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,641
I don't have a lot of memories
of when I lived with you,

75
00:04:52,808 --> 00:04:56,233
but sometimes it just comes back
out of the blue.

76
00:04:56,556 --> 00:04:57,563
Like,

77
00:04:57,733 --> 00:05:00,628
when I eat tacos,
I remember that we had tacos a lot.

78
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:07,176
So, what made you guys decide
to move to Beverly Hills?

79
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:11,139
Harry grew up here.

80
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:12,932
No kidding.

81
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:18,560
When we finally moved here, it was
like a huge culture shock all around.

82
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,041
Stop. You had
no adjustment problems.

83
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:24,120
He had no adjustment problems.

84
00:05:24,378 --> 00:05:25,695
He's on the surf team.

85
00:05:28,054 --> 00:05:30,366
What can I say?
I'm a natural athlete.

86
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:43,338
When I used to play little League,
we almost won the pennant, remember?

87
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,424
That was a long time ago.

88
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:04,409
Come in.

89
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:12,006
- Hey, boss, what you up to?
- Watching anti-drug PSA's.

90
00:06:12,176 --> 00:06:14,619
Principal Wilson is making me
produce one for the Blaze.

91
00:06:15,366 --> 00:06:16,829
- Fun.
- Yeah, no kidding.

92
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:20,922
I swear, I am going stir-crazy at home.
Can't wait to get back to school.

93
00:06:21,335 --> 00:06:24,545
I wouldn't say that too loud,
unless you want to be called a geek.

94
00:06:24,805 --> 00:06:26,589
- By who?
- Me... geek.

95
00:06:28,474 --> 00:06:30,661
That the latest edition
of the Blaze?

96
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:37,771
It sort of features
Naomi's first segment.

97
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:42,647
What do you mean? Who gave
her the segment? I left you in charge.

98
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:46,609
I have classes. I can't squat in the
media lab and guard all the equipment.

99
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:48,945
I didn't say
you had to squat. Is it awful?

100
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:54,075
It's worse than awful.

101
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:00,287
All right, Wesbevers,

102
00:07:00,457 --> 00:07:04,460
it's time for your about-to-be favorite
new segment brought to you by me.

103
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:07,135
So it's gonna be
extra hot and spicy.

104
00:07:07,892 --> 00:07:09,051
Blind item.

105
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:12,206
What senior lacrosse star
was seen hooking up

106
00:07:12,376 --> 00:07:15,555
with a not-so-virginal cheerleader
outside Health class Monday?

107
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:19,230
Hint: His initials are M.T.,
and hers--

108
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,959
Erin Graybridge.

109
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:24,900
Let me tell you, they were
definitely getting busy.

110
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,660
Lust is not really an issue
for me, people,

111
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,211
but in public...

112
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:30,670
Get a room.

113
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:32,745
Speaking of disgusting,

114
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,312
what former reform student
likes to stick more up his nose

115
00:07:36,482 --> 00:07:38,343
than you care to know about?

116
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:40,413
How long is this crap?

117
00:07:40,813 --> 00:07:43,921
- About seven minutes.
- We got to put a stop to this.

118
00:07:47,013 --> 00:07:49,377
News flash! Teddy Montgomery
is a major player.

119
00:07:49,547 --> 00:07:52,541
Was a major player.
He's not anymore.

120
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:54,536
Why are you so upset?

121
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:57,347
'Cause there were
these big-boobed bimbos

122
00:07:57,517 --> 00:07:59,496
all up in my face all night.

123
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,894
Are you asking me if you should get
implants? If you are, it's a great...

124
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:05,813
- big no-no.
- I'm not getting implants.

125
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,106
Agreed.

126
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,049
Then what are you going to do?

127
00:08:13,065 --> 00:08:14,238
Nothing.

128
00:08:14,498 --> 00:08:17,717
I just have to get comfortable
with the fact that Teddy has a past.

129
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:20,429
'Cause that's all that it is.
It's his past,

130
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:22,497
and I can deal with that.

131
00:08:23,883 --> 00:08:25,359
You're a lot stronger than me.

132
00:08:25,526 --> 00:08:27,675
If I were dating him,
I'd be constantly wondering,

133
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:30,375
"When is he gonna cheat on me?
When is he gonna cheat on me?"

134
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:32,298
You're right.
No need to worry.

135
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:34,445
You just have to be sensible,
that's all.

136
00:08:34,612 --> 00:08:38,378
So check his e-mail, monitor his
cell phone and follow him occasionally.

137
00:08:39,637 --> 00:08:41,036
You know, the usual.

Season 02 Episode 15
<i>What's Past Is Prologue</i>

140
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:32,723
It wasn't that bad.

141
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,718
Worst... dinner... ever.

142
00:09:37,957 --> 00:09:41,144
Every time I'd say something,
every time I tried to connect,

143
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,869
she changed the subject.

144
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:48,151
This was a mistake. I don't even know
what I was thinking, wanting to see her.

145
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,530
- Don't say that.
- It's true, though.

146
00:09:50,928 --> 00:09:54,256
We're basically strangers.
I don't even know what to call her.

147
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:56,228
Mom? Dana?

148
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,385
Woman-who-gave-birth-to-me
and-doesn't-wanna-talk-to-me at-dinner?

149
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:01,704
That one seems a little long.

150
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:03,942
I'm serious.

151
00:10:04,332 --> 00:10:05,288
I know.

152
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:09,759
Maybe tonight didn't go well
because there was too much pressure.

153
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:13,140
With all of us there? But if
you spend some time alone with her...

154
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,544
In awkward silence?

155
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,026
It'll get better.

156
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:18,988
Come on, you have to at least
give it another try.

157
00:10:20,027 --> 00:10:21,991
You've waited too long not to.

158
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,871
That comment about saying grace...

159
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:38,341
- You don't think she was judging us?
- I don't.

160
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,091
Not that I would blame her
if she was judging.

161
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:46,098
We aren't exactly coming
off as the world's greatest parents.

162
00:10:46,358 --> 00:10:50,144
We had no idea that our son and daughter
drove to Phoenix for spring break.

163
00:10:50,404 --> 00:10:51,208
I know.

164
00:10:51,378 --> 00:10:53,619
Why didn't Dixon tell us
that he wanted to see her?

165
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:55,066
I don't know.

166
00:10:55,534 --> 00:10:58,236
He probably thought we'd be
threatened, which is crazy.

167
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:00,320
Of course.

168
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,101
So we need to make sure
he knows we're comfortable with this,

169
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:05,785
with having her here
as a part of our lives.

170
00:11:07,262 --> 00:11:09,037
Absolutely.
You're right.

171
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,102
We will make sure that he knows
we're comfortable.

172
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:22,218
Nothing like early morning waves.

173
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:24,427
You were on fire out there, my man.

174
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:28,529
That's what happens when you have girls
fighting over you. Helps the mojo.

175
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:30,351
Did Naomi really bite Ivy?

176
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:36,829
Guys...

177
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:38,935
Where the hell is my car?

178
00:11:52,996 --> 00:11:54,433
I love this song.

179
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:23,825
You have an amazing voice.

180
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:26,544
Just so you know, I have
no place to be after school.

181
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:28,576
So, if you have stuff to do
at the Blaze,

182
00:12:28,836 --> 00:12:30,866
I could just wait for you there.

183
00:12:31,203 --> 00:12:33,228
Come on, you are so transparent.

184
00:12:33,398 --> 00:12:36,417
You clearly want to go to the Blaze
'cause you want to bump into Navid.

185
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,461
That is so not true.

186
00:12:39,805 --> 00:12:42,340
Okay, that's totally true.
But, can you blame me?

187
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,251
The boy almost got expelled...

188
00:12:45,421 --> 00:12:47,900
- for me.
- What are you talking about?

189
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:51,932
Come on, Ade, spill.

190
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,185
You cannot tell anybody.

191
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,273
I talked to Navid,

192
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:02,985
and he said he bought the coke
and planted it in Jasper's locker.

193
00:13:03,435 --> 00:13:06,697
And then Jasper somehow found out,
and planted it in Navid's locker.

194
00:13:07,214 --> 00:13:10,701
He was going after Jasper because
he knew Jasper was dealing me drugs.

195
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:12,912
He was doing it for me.

196
00:13:15,206 --> 00:13:18,250
He was always like that.
How could I have thrown that away?

197
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,874
How the hell am I supposed
to get over a guy like that?

198
00:13:24,174 --> 00:13:25,085
You will.

199
00:13:26,316 --> 00:13:28,044
When you meet someone else.

200
00:13:28,812 --> 00:13:30,221
That's what happened to me.

201
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,696
Excuse me?

202
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:34,934
You like somebody,
you haven't told me?

203
00:13:45,204 --> 00:13:48,453
I can't believe someone stole your car.
That is so messed up.

204
00:13:48,623 --> 00:13:50,188
Maybe they'll find it.

205
00:13:50,358 --> 00:13:51,384
Yeah, right.

206
00:13:51,554 --> 00:13:54,213
Please tell my parents
not to hold their breath.

207
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:56,080
Lemme get a bagel?

208
00:13:57,634 --> 00:14:00,165
Onion, my favorite.
Dude, how did you know?

209
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,087
- The prodigal son returns.
- What's up?

210
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:06,803
I still don't get how being
suspended from school is a punishment...

211
00:14:06,973 --> 00:14:08,837
sounds more like a vacation.

212
00:14:09,007 --> 00:14:10,933
You ever face disappointed
Persian parents?

213
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,181
My own mother said that I urinated
on the legacy of my ancestors.

214
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:17,572
- Harsh.
- And very specific.

215
00:14:17,742 --> 00:14:19,066
I'm just glad to be back.

216
00:14:19,236 --> 00:14:21,647
Especially since I can't destroy
Jasper's life from home.

217
00:14:23,784 --> 00:14:25,401
It might be time to let that go.

218
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:27,445
Are you kidding me?

219
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:30,156
The last plan
didn't exactly go so well.

220
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:34,151
The next one will. He needs to go down.
The guy got Ade back on drugs.

221
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:37,727
That's what this is about.

222
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:40,414
It's about a lot of things.

223
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:43,461
- The guy pushed me down the stairs.
- But that's not what you said.

224
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:47,173
- You said he got Ade back on drugs.
- You a lawyer now? What's your point?

225
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:50,259
My point is, maybe this is

226
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:53,554
less about Jasper and more about the
feelings you still have for Adrianna.

227
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:56,765
Come on, dude, that's ridiculous.
I've clearly moved on.

228
00:14:58,037 --> 00:15:01,270
Really? Because it's been a few months
and you haven't looked at another girl.

229
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,664
I've looked at plenty of girls. In fact,
my cousin came over the other night

230
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:07,951
and I couldn't help noticing that
she had suddenly become very womanly.

231
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:09,403
If you know what I mean.

232
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,849
The point is, I'm over Ade.

233
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:15,784
I'm totally ready to date.

234
00:15:17,337 --> 00:15:19,335
I am. I'm gonna ask someone out
very shortly.

235
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,623
Sounds good.

236
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,738
Just not your cousin.

237
00:15:36,805 --> 00:15:39,350
I'm sorry,
are you copying off of me?

238
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:41,685
I thought we were study partners.

239
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:45,773
So what am I getting
out of this partnership?

240
00:15:51,026 --> 00:15:52,026
That.

241
00:15:53,312 --> 00:15:54,281
Copy away.

242
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,498
I'll be right back.

243
00:16:20,753 --> 00:16:23,936
<i>Hey babe. Can't wait to see you.
That coffee shop on Robertson at 5?</i>

244
00:16:41,088 --> 00:16:44,957
Health... care... reform... is...
definitely... a... public... issue.

245
00:16:47,202 --> 00:16:48,902
She sounds smart...

246
00:16:49,535 --> 00:16:51,549
She looks like she's
having an epileptic fit,

247
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:53,554
but we're much, much better.
We're good.

248
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:55,947
- We're really good.
- We're brilliant.

249
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,139
- It's totally unusable.
- Totally. I know.

250
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,829
Let's watch it again.

251
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,782
Health... care... reform... is...
definitely... a... public... issue.

252
00:17:07,564 --> 00:17:09,189
Do you want to go to dinner?

253
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:11,567
Sorry?

254
00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:14,776
Do you want to go to dinner with me?

255
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:16,293
Maybe? Sometime?

256
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:17,484
Or not.

257
00:17:18,902 --> 00:17:20,508
That's also an option.

258
00:17:24,462 --> 00:17:25,298
Sure.

259
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:30,821
I eat dinner.
And you eat dinner.

260
00:17:30,991 --> 00:17:33,302
And why not eat dinner together?

261
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:36,245
- Cool.
- Great.

262
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:39,947
Sounds good.

263
00:17:47,376 --> 00:17:49,132
You don't have to thank me.

264
00:17:51,886 --> 00:17:53,163
For the flier?

265
00:17:53,414 --> 00:17:56,021
- Not a problem. I wasn't going to.
- Read it.

266
00:17:58,627 --> 00:18:01,763
"The Glorious Steinems are
looking for a lead vocalist."

267
00:18:02,042 --> 00:18:04,891
- That's good to know.
- You've heard of them, right?

268
00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:06,168
They're rad.

269
00:18:06,338 --> 00:18:09,308
They go to West Bev, but they're
a real band. They play all over L.A.

270
00:18:09,478 --> 00:18:11,997
The lead guitarist's dad
was in Guns N' Roses,

271
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:13,837
so they get serious exposure.

272
00:18:14,224 --> 00:18:17,132
- And... you want to go see a show?
- Once you're singing with them.

273
00:18:17,785 --> 00:18:18,759
Me?

274
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:22,471
You've got the most amazing voice.
And you need to get your mind off Navid.

275
00:18:22,731 --> 00:18:24,096
Gia, you're sweet.

276
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:26,350
And, yeah, I do have
to get over Navid.

277
00:18:27,011 --> 00:18:30,187
But joining a band?
That's just not going to work.

278
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:34,264
Thank you for trying, though.

279
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:37,027
You're a really great friend.

280
00:18:54,846 --> 00:18:56,213
Want some coconut water?

281
00:18:57,006 --> 00:18:59,109
Restores balance to your doshas.

282
00:18:59,411 --> 00:19:02,261
- Can I get it with a shot of tequila?
- Everything okay?

283
00:19:03,305 --> 00:19:04,430
Yeah, totally.

284
00:19:05,196 --> 00:19:06,515
What's going on?

285
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:08,799
Nothing really.

286
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:12,599
Things are just a little
crazy at home.

287
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,489
My son's birthmother has come

288
00:19:18,843 --> 00:19:20,284
How's that going?

289
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,677
I think it's hard for him, you know?

290
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:26,582
He hasn't seen her since
he was eight years old.

291
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,834
There are obviously
a lot of expectations.

292
00:19:30,414 --> 00:19:32,129
I meant, how's it going for you?

293
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,588
Me?

294
00:19:34,683 --> 00:19:35,999
I'm fine.

295
00:19:38,116 --> 00:19:40,855
I just want to make sure that he knows
that I'm not threatened,

296
00:19:41,148 --> 00:19:42,473
so he feels comfortable.

297
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:45,267
But is it true?

298
00:19:46,255 --> 00:19:50,159
I imagine it would feel threatening,
having her there.

299
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:54,241
Yes.

300
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:56,153
It does.

301
00:19:59,535 --> 00:20:03,076
But that's not fair.
I need to focus on my son.

302
00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:05,913
I know you're dealing
with a complicated situation.

303
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,932
But I just want you to know
that everything you're feeling,

304
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:10,399
it's valid, Deb.

305
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:13,558
Thanks.

306
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,894
We've barely begun dating,
and he's already cheating on me.

307
00:20:19,061 --> 00:20:21,354
At least I think he is.
Maybe he isn't.

308
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:24,021
Do you think he is?
No, don't answer that. You have no idea.

309
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:27,447
- That's what I was gonna say, no idea.
- Come on! Don't be naive. He...

310
00:20:28,407 --> 00:20:32,397
This girl programmed his ringtone
to be "I Want Your Sex."

311
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,423
Why else would he be
meeting up with her?

312
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,273
- Maybe he won't go.
- You think he's gonna stand her up?

313
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,321
- I don't know.
- Me, either.

314
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:43,008
I wish that I could
un-see the e-mail.

315
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,936
There's nothing that I can do.
I can't exactly talk to him about it,

316
00:20:46,103 --> 00:20:48,704
- cause then he'll know that I spied.
- You didn't actually spy.

317
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:51,442
Spying would be going to the coffee shop
to see if he shows up.

318
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:53,210
You should go see if he shows up.

319
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,488
- Just say it's a coincidence?
- Don't let him see you. If he sees you

320
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:59,258
he won't do whatever it is he might
or not be planning on doing.

321
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,094
You're right maybe I'll just bring out
my fake curly moustache.

322
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,887
Unfortunately, that won't work.

323
00:21:05,095 --> 00:21:07,224
Just send someone he doesn't know.

324
00:21:08,464 --> 00:21:10,216
Maybe. But who?

325
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,260
What?

326
00:21:23,604 --> 00:21:24,904
We need a favor.

327
00:21:38,044 --> 00:21:39,256
The foam soy latte.

328
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,796
I thought you were
gonna stand me up, babe.

329
00:22:20,046 --> 00:22:22,346
I just couldn't find a parking spot.

330
00:22:30,565 --> 00:22:31,565
So...

331
00:22:32,431 --> 00:22:34,262
What's been going on with you,
anyway?

332
00:22:34,841 --> 00:22:36,506
Mean, you've been kinda AWOL.

333
00:22:36,673 --> 00:22:38,938
And my parents are out of town,
which means

334
00:22:39,338 --> 00:22:41,288
the Malibu house is all ours.

335
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,822
Look, Amy, the thing is...

336
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:47,866
I'm dating someone.

337
00:22:49,232 --> 00:22:50,480
The good news is,

338
00:22:50,647 --> 00:22:53,266
I'm not gonna tell her
if you go up to Malibu.

339
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:55,749
And I'm guessing you're
not gonna tell her, so...

340
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,210
There's no problem, right?

341
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:03,411
I can't...

342
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,322
I really like this girl,
and I want to give the...

343
00:23:06,489 --> 00:23:08,905
The whole monogamy thing a try,
you know?

344
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,848
So then why did you come here?

345
00:23:16,055 --> 00:23:17,705
Look, I made a mistake.

346
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:19,856
You're right, I shouldn't have come.

347
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,943
Yeah, no kidding.

348
00:23:23,434 --> 00:23:24,434
You know,

349
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,712
you can talk all you want about giving
this whole monogamy thing a try,

350
00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:30,129
but guess what?

351
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:31,868
It's not who you are.

352
00:23:32,388 --> 00:23:33,578
I guess we'll see.

353
00:23:35,943 --> 00:23:37,793
Take care of yourself, Amy.

354
00:24:01,772 --> 00:24:04,363
- Sorry I'm late.
- You're not late. I'm early.

355
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,495
I'm always early, you know.

356
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:09,573
Like they say,
the early bird catches the worm.

357
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,911
Not that, not that you're
a worm or worm like.

358
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:19,583
Thank you... I think.
Was that a compliment?

359
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,106
Not a very good one.

360
00:24:21,413 --> 00:24:23,462
You look great. How's that?

361
00:24:24,495 --> 00:24:26,131
Better than "not worm like."

362
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,200
Let's go.

363
00:24:30,931 --> 00:24:32,081
Ladies first.

364
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,573
You're not having a stroke, are you?

365
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,838
No, no, no, I'm not having a stroke.

366
00:24:54,294 --> 00:24:56,036
Are forearms rude?
I can't remember.

367
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,465
- I know that elbows are rude.
- Forearms are fine.

368
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:02,167
And I say that with authority cause
my mother forced me to go to cotillion

369
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,550
- when I was in fourth grade.
- Are you kidding?

370
00:25:05,165 --> 00:25:07,881
I had to do that, too.
It was a colossal waste of time.

371
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:10,801
Yeah, right up there with learning
the quadratic equation.

372
00:25:11,258 --> 00:25:14,513
Right, and I mean does a ten-year-old
really need to know how to foxtrot?

373
00:25:15,377 --> 00:25:17,200
- The foxtrot.
- Remember that?

374
00:25:17,367 --> 00:25:19,775
"Slow, quick-quick,
slow, quick-quick."

375
00:25:19,942 --> 00:25:21,394
"Rock left and promenade."

376
00:25:21,644 --> 00:25:25,017
I was always steppin on my partner's
foot. She was this funny little tomboy

377
00:25:25,184 --> 00:25:27,734
who was always wearing
this sailor suit-style dress.

378
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:31,347
She's probably in the Navy now. That is,
if she can still walk. Poor thing.

379
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:34,199
- Whenever we had to go left...
- You went right.

380
00:25:35,437 --> 00:25:37,875
And you didn't so much
as step on my foot

381
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:39,542
as stomp on my foot.

382
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,464
- That was you?
- That was me.

383
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,460
But I'm not in the Navy.

384
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,742
No, no, you're not.

385
00:25:50,323 --> 00:25:52,884
- That's weird.
- No kidding.

386
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,646
So I guess, technically,
this is our second date.

387
00:26:00,387 --> 00:26:01,393
Yeah.

388
00:26:04,846 --> 00:26:05,946
Yeah, it is.

389
00:26:29,869 --> 00:26:31,419
So, what's the score?

390
00:26:33,453 --> 00:26:34,753
You into sports?

391
00:26:35,455 --> 00:26:36,755
Celtics-Pistons.

392
00:26:37,064 --> 00:26:39,095
It don't get much better than that.

393
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:40,689
No kidding?

394
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:43,518
Plus I got a few bones
riding on the game.

395
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:45,937
- You gamble?
- It's just a little bit online.

396
00:26:46,446 --> 00:26:48,982
It just makes the games
a little more exciting.

397
00:26:51,466 --> 00:26:52,652
You don't approve?

398
00:26:53,055 --> 00:26:55,129
No, no, it's not that.

399
00:26:56,138 --> 00:27:00,142
- Just surprised, that's all.
- Just getting to know each other?

400
00:27:03,607 --> 00:27:07,167
- Do you want to get to know me?
- Dixon, of course.

401
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:11,601
- Why else would I be here?
- I don't know. It's...

402
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,967
It's just that last night was weird.

403
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,610
I kept trying to say something,
and you kept changing the subject.

404
00:27:24,938 --> 00:27:26,853
You kept bringing up the past.

405
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,940
- Was it stuff you didn't remember?
- Are you kidding?

406
00:27:30,258 --> 00:27:33,448
I remember everything. Everything.

407
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:35,278
The tacos you like.

408
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,867
We ate 'em for 89
days straight once,

409
00:27:38,034 --> 00:27:40,134
for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

410
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:45,479
I was having a manic episode, and I made
my kid eat tacos for 89 days straight.

411
00:27:46,026 --> 00:27:49,476
And I'm sitting there with the Wilsons
in their fancy home

412
00:27:50,092 --> 00:27:52,192
with their home-cooked food, and

413
00:27:53,467 --> 00:27:56,675
I just didn't want them
to hear about 89 days of tacos.

414
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:01,819
Didn't want them to think I was a worse
mom than they already do.

415
00:28:01,986 --> 00:28:04,723
- They don't think you're a bad mom.
- Come on.

416
00:28:05,706 --> 00:28:07,060
How could they not?

417
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,532
They knew you couldn't
handle the kid, so

418
00:28:10,132 --> 00:28:12,232
you gave me up to people who could.

419
00:28:14,116 --> 00:28:16,748
Honestly,
I think they're pretty grateful.

420
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,036
Cause you know,
I am quite the prize.

421
00:28:28,435 --> 00:28:30,852
Why would you say that?
What do you mean, I'm a bad dater?

422
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:33,977
I'm just saying, on our first date
you stomped on my foot.

423
00:28:34,206 --> 00:28:37,080
On our second date
you not only implied that I'm worm like,

424
00:28:37,247 --> 00:28:39,932
but you also insinuated that I have
the fashion sense of a sailor.

425
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:42,304
I'm sorry.
That dress was lovely.

426
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:44,161
Too little too late.

427
00:28:44,328 --> 00:28:46,587
Okay, you know what?
You're right sort of.

428
00:28:47,181 --> 00:28:49,978
I'm just terrible with
first and second dates.

429
00:28:50,918 --> 00:28:52,218
But the third...

430
00:28:52,446 --> 00:28:55,483
- The third is when I come alive.
- How do you ever get to the third date?

431
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:56,776
I rarely do.

432
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:59,626
But if you'll give me the chance,
well...

433
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,296
- Prepare to be swept away.
- Swept away?

434
00:29:05,564 --> 00:29:06,828
So, what do you say?

435
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:12,249
- Can I tell you something?
- Sure.

436
00:29:15,327 --> 00:29:17,536
When you first asked me out,

437
00:29:18,231 --> 00:29:21,176
I thought you were just doing
it to get over Adrianna.

438
00:29:22,578 --> 00:29:23,578
I was.

439
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,972
But that's not why I'm here now.

440
00:29:26,418 --> 00:29:29,309
I'm here now because
I really like you.

441
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,254
So, will you please
give me another chance

442
00:29:34,421 --> 00:29:36,608
to take you out again
and to not insult you?

443
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:44,074
And maybe even kiss you?

444
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:47,994
Okay.

445
00:29:57,237 --> 00:29:58,249
20 questions.

446
00:29:58,416 --> 00:30:00,251
If I can guess your crush,

447
00:30:00,418 --> 00:30:01,966
you have to tell me, okay?

448
00:30:02,216 --> 00:30:04,018
Yes, and that was
your first question.

449
00:30:04,185 --> 00:30:06,406
- Are you serious?
- 18 and counting.

450
00:30:06,785 --> 00:30:08,685
My God, you are such a brat.

451
00:30:09,461 --> 00:30:10,961
Okay, next question.

452
00:30:18,185 --> 00:30:19,185
Ade, stop.

453
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,668
- I just wasn't expecting...
- I know.

454
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:25,573
What's wrong with me?

455
00:30:26,017 --> 00:30:28,535
I knew that that was gonna
happen at some point.

456
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,787
It's okay to be upset.

457
00:30:31,853 --> 00:30:33,206
For how long?

458
00:30:34,026 --> 00:30:37,419
I have to find a way to get over him.
I have to find a way.

459
00:30:37,994 --> 00:30:39,963
Those auditions are
still going on tonight.

460
00:30:43,323 --> 00:30:44,982
Yeah, okay.

461
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:48,965
Right now, I will try anything.

462
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:36,519
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

463
00:31:40,606 --> 00:31:42,206
You were unbelievable.

464
00:31:42,781 --> 00:31:44,519
Thanks. Let's get of here.

465
00:31:47,135 --> 00:31:48,135
Wait.

466
00:31:49,323 --> 00:31:52,571
We're supposed to wait till tomorrow
and have all kinds of callbacks, but

467
00:31:52,738 --> 00:31:54,550
hell, we don't need to.

468
00:31:54,945 --> 00:31:55,955
You're in.

469
00:31:57,672 --> 00:31:59,667
- Really?
- You blew us away.

470
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:10,360
Why are cupcakes so
much better than cake?

471
00:32:10,527 --> 00:32:12,077
Is it just the shape?

472
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:14,969
No, it's the fact that
you don't have to bother with birthdays.

473
00:32:15,136 --> 00:32:17,959
Let's face it, everyone,
birthdays suck unless they're mine.

474
00:32:18,126 --> 00:32:19,604
How's your cupcake, Sil?

475
00:32:22,931 --> 00:32:24,455
What's with the mood?

476
00:32:24,622 --> 00:32:27,237
We're supposed to be celebrating.
Teddy didn't cheat.

477
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,323
I sent Gia to spy on him.
What kind of person does that?

478
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,408
You did find that
incriminating e-mail.

479
00:32:32,924 --> 00:32:36,324
Exactly. I read his e-mail,
instead of just trusting him.

480
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,206
I feel terrible.

481
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,449
So, you got a little carried away.

482
00:32:42,184 --> 00:32:44,271
Anyway, point is, it's over.

483
00:32:44,438 --> 00:32:47,298
You got the answer you wanted.
Can we just put this behind us, please?

484
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,259
She's right.
What's done is done.

485
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:53,846
Sometimes we mess up
and we just have to move on.

486
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,966
My God, we need to go right now.

487
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:10,433
- What, what's going on?
- Are you okay?

488
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,617
- What the hell?
- Is he stalking you?

489
00:33:15,388 --> 00:33:18,028
I don't wanna talk about it.
Let's just go.

490
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,916
Maybe I should text Dixon.
They should've been home by now.

491
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:32,883
Go ahead, send him a text.

492
00:33:38,563 --> 00:33:39,809
But I shouldn't, right?

493
00:33:41,435 --> 00:33:43,646
He's with Dana.
I'm sure he's fine.

494
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,898
I agree, I'm sure he is.

495
00:33:48,381 --> 00:33:49,381
I'll wait.

496
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,590
Give him some space.

497
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,324
Maybe that's him.

498
00:33:55,268 --> 00:33:56,284
Hello?

499
00:33:58,055 --> 00:34:00,121
- Is it Dixon?
- You're kidding me.

500
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:02,415
- Is everything okay?
- It's not Dixon.

501
00:34:03,005 --> 00:34:05,587
Right, okay.
Well, I appreciate the call.

502
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:08,059
Yeah, thank you.

503
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:12,425
The police found the kids' car.
Downtown, completely stripped.

504
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:13,825
Unbelievable.

505
00:34:15,407 --> 00:34:16,424
What?!

506
00:34:16,591 --> 00:34:19,015
The Suns challenge the Lakers
for the West?

507
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,258
- In your dreams.
- I don't need to dream it,

508
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:23,096
- I need to see it.
- Hey, you two.

509
00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:24,738
- You have fun?
- We did.

510
00:34:24,905 --> 00:34:27,440
I'm sorry to keep him out so late.
We just lost track of time.

511
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,609
No, that's okay.
We're glad you had fun.

512
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,009
Well, we did.

513
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,172
Anyway I'm beat, guys.

514
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:36,532
So, good night Mom, good night, Dad.

515
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:38,550
Wait, I'll walk up with you.

516
00:34:38,717 --> 00:34:40,629
- Night, you two.
- Sleep well.

517
00:34:41,868 --> 00:34:43,289
See?
It went well.

518
00:34:45,141 --> 00:34:47,293
Yeah. It looks like it did.

519
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:50,505
So all this anxiety
was for nothing, right?

520
00:34:54,683 --> 00:34:56,859
You know, everything I'm
feeling is valid, okay?

521
00:34:57,026 --> 00:34:59,222
And it would be nice if my
husband understood that.

522
00:35:47,898 --> 00:35:49,198
Look who's here.

523
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:52,035
- Hey, guys.
- Adrianna, hi.

524
00:35:52,202 --> 00:35:55,111
So, where's your tambourine?

525
00:35:56,261 --> 00:35:58,322
I don't have a tambourine.

526
00:35:58,736 --> 00:36:00,845
I told you she didn't, Liv.

527
00:36:01,012 --> 00:36:02,854
Liv hates the tambourine.

528
00:36:03,021 --> 00:36:04,787
Because it's not an instrument.

529
00:36:05,422 --> 00:36:07,396
It's a glorified baby rattle.

530
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,014
I promise you
I do not own a tambourine,

531
00:36:10,181 --> 00:36:12,336
nor will I ever take
up the tambourine.

532
00:36:12,694 --> 00:36:14,380
All right then, we're cool.

533
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:16,965
Cool.

534
00:36:19,746 --> 00:36:21,304
It's five past...
where is she?

535
00:36:21,628 --> 00:36:24,369
Dude, would you chill?
I'm here, I'm here.

536
00:36:26,695 --> 00:36:27,810
Seven minutes late.

537
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,145
Relax, it's fine.

538
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,607
Adrianna, this is Lila,
our bass player.

539
00:36:43,222 --> 00:36:45,722
So, somebody had
a hot date last night.

540
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,920
Me, I met somebody.

541
00:36:51,068 --> 00:36:52,842
Please tell me it
wasn't your cousin.

542
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:55,435
Will you get off that already?
No one thinks it's funny.

543
00:36:55,602 --> 00:36:56,627
Actually I do.

544
00:36:56,794 --> 00:36:58,760
Whatever.
Now I don't even feel telling you

545
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:01,323
who I went out on a date with.
You guys just blew it.

546
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:02,740
- All right.
- Cool

547
00:37:06,703 --> 00:37:09,014
Okay, it was Lila.
All right? And...

548
00:37:10,203 --> 00:37:12,353
it was cool.
It was really cool.

549
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:16,108
Cool enough for you to move off
your whole Jasper vendetta?

550
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,420
It was, actually.

551
00:37:19,894 --> 00:37:21,682
Whatever you could've been right.

552
00:37:21,997 --> 00:37:23,768
The whole thing, it could've had

553
00:37:23,935 --> 00:37:25,576
a little something to do with Ade.

554
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,294
I got a question.
So, who's hotter?

555
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,249
Lila or your cousin?

556
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,149
Dude, will you shut up?

557
00:37:34,778 --> 00:37:36,578
But Lila, definitely Lila.

558
00:37:38,183 --> 00:37:41,323
I cannot believe this.
I joined the band to get over Navid

559
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:44,361
and now I have to spend every day
with the new girl he's dating?

560
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:47,093
- It sucks!
- It does. It really sucks.

561
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,800
How am I gonna do this?

562
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:51,590
- You'll figure it out.
- No, I won't, I can't.

563
00:37:51,757 --> 00:37:53,865
- Maybe I should just quit.
- Are you serious?

564
00:37:54,032 --> 00:37:57,400
Every day I'm gonna be
reminded of Navid and what I lost.

565
00:37:58,344 --> 00:38:01,320
You know what? That's it.
I cannot hear about Navid anymore.

566
00:38:03,353 --> 00:38:04,353
Okay.

567
00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:08,207
I'm sorry I've been going
on and on about him.

568
00:38:08,374 --> 00:38:09,662
That's not the problem.

569
00:38:10,493 --> 00:38:11,497
Then what?

570
00:38:13,322 --> 00:38:14,322
Nothing.

571
00:38:15,646 --> 00:38:17,196
Gia, you can tell me.

572
00:38:19,101 --> 00:38:20,101
What?

573
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,510
- We're friends.
- I like you, okay?

574
00:38:25,945 --> 00:38:27,589
The problem is...

575
00:38:28,483 --> 00:38:29,533
I like you.

576
00:38:34,288 --> 00:38:36,798
My coach said, "You're gonna
have to kick it into high gear."

577
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:39,373
Which is true, I've got
a bunch of tournaments coming up.

578
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,111
You've never seen me hardcore.
I hope it doesn't scare you off.

579
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,238
What

580
00:38:45,283 --> 00:38:46,407
I can't do this.

581
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,095
I'm still gonna have plenty
of time for us, and...

582
00:38:49,262 --> 00:38:50,830
Look, it's not that.

583
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,581
I gotta tell you something, okay?

584
00:38:54,758 --> 00:38:55,758
Okay.

585
00:39:01,659 --> 00:39:02,924
I read your e-mail.

586
00:39:04,024 --> 00:39:05,624
- What?
- I did, I...

587
00:39:06,548 --> 00:39:08,940
I opened it up, and I saw that

588
00:39:09,107 --> 00:39:12,558
there was this message from Amy
and that she wanted to meet you and...

589
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,266
Look, nothing happened.

590
00:39:14,433 --> 00:39:16,633
No know that it didn't, because...

591
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:18,898
Because...

592
00:39:21,295 --> 00:39:23,736
I had my friend Gia go to
the coffee shop, and...

593
00:39:24,257 --> 00:39:26,697
She, like, kind of...
she watched you guys.

594
00:39:30,292 --> 00:39:31,410
You spied on me?

595
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:34,997
Yeah I did.
I'm so sorry, okay? I...

596
00:39:35,405 --> 00:39:37,708
It's just been... it's...
It's been really hard

597
00:39:38,823 --> 00:39:42,004
because of your past. All these girls
that keep coming up to you.

598
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,699
I was feeling insecure.

599
00:39:46,866 --> 00:39:48,719
And I didn't know if
I could trust you.

600
00:39:50,242 --> 00:39:52,014
But it doesn't matter, because...

601
00:39:53,803 --> 00:39:54,953
It was wrong.

602
00:39:55,877 --> 00:39:56,936
And I was wrong.

603
00:39:58,812 --> 00:40:00,606
But it's never gonna happen again.

604
00:40:02,464 --> 00:40:04,485
Because now I know I can trust you.

605
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,988
That's great, it is.

606
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:10,158
But the thing is...

607
00:40:11,316 --> 00:40:13,160
Now I don't know if I can trust you.

608
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,414
Look... I...

609
00:40:18,939 --> 00:40:20,543
I need some space, okay?

610
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:21,993
Don't do this.

611
00:40:34,035 --> 00:40:37,073
- You need a ride?
- Stop, just stop stalking me.

612
00:40:37,396 --> 00:40:39,395
I don't know what
you're talking about.

613
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,582
I saw you last night, okay?
And the night before that.

614
00:40:42,749 --> 00:40:45,233
- You're really scaring me.
- I'm sorry.

615
00:40:45,848 --> 00:40:48,696
But you don't need to be afraid of me.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

616
00:40:49,277 --> 00:40:51,907
- I'm just trying to help.
- I don't need your help.

617
00:40:52,157 --> 00:40:53,325
You do, actually.

618
00:40:54,404 --> 00:40:56,981
Who do you think
got rid of the one piece of evidence

619
00:40:57,148 --> 00:40:58,956
that's linking you
to my uncle's death?

620
00:40:59,892 --> 00:41:01,751
- What?
- The car.

621
00:41:03,996 --> 00:41:07,131
It was you who stole our car.

622
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:10,240
What if the police ever
came looking for physical evidence?

623
00:41:10,491 --> 00:41:13,012
Now there is none, it's gone.

624
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:19,810
See, I'm just... I'm
just looking out for you.

625
