1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:03,450
We need to talk.

2
00:00:03,484 --> 00:00:05,450
We have a son together.

3
00:00:05,484 --> 00:00:07,584
-I'm ozzie. -now that I know who you are,

4
00:00:07,617 --> 00:00:08,833
It's gonna sting so much more

5
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:10,050
when I never talk to you again.

6
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:12,684
I am tired of pretending that everything is okay

7
00:00:12,717 --> 00:00:14,717
When it's not-- we need to tell the kids

8
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:16,050
About your birth son sooner than later. no, no, no.

9
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:16,884
I caught her buying drugs.

10
00:00:16,918 --> 00:00:18,250
I'm a cop, you dumbass.

11
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,417
-How old are you, anyway? -I'm 25, why?

12
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,417
-I would literally do anything for you. -oh, my god.

13
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,617
-You paid for my rehab? -yeah, I did.

14
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:25,917
I don't think we can be friends

15
00:00:25,917 --> 00:00:27,183
if you're with ethan.

16
00:00:27,217 --> 00:00:29,717
I know that I can't stop him from dating other people.

17
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:31,384
It just can't be you.

18
00:00:42,851 --> 00:00:44,117
So.

19
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,150
So...?

20
00:00:46,183 --> 00:00:47,517
So, I have something

21
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:50,817
That I would like to discuss as a family.

22
00:00:57,617 --> 00:00:59,984
When I was in high school, I dated tracy clark.

23
00:01:00,918 --> 00:01:01,951
Uh-- I'm sorry.

24
00:01:01,984 --> 00:01:03,484
That was just disturbing.

25
00:01:03,517 --> 00:01:04,884
It was a long time ago.

26
00:01:04,918 --> 00:01:09,784
When I was in high school, I dated tracy clark,

27
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:11,317
And at the end of senior year,

28
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,751
She... got pregnant.

29
00:01:12,784 --> 00:01:15,018
Very surprising, and obviously

30
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,350
A big deal, but, um...

31
00:01:17,384 --> 00:01:21,784
Well, tracy and i, we weren't... Right for each other as a couple

32
00:01:21,817 --> 00:01:25,984
And weren't ready for the responsibility that a child would entail, so,

33
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:29,183
We decided not to keep the child.

34
00:01:30,217 --> 00:01:32,450
The baby.

35
00:01:32,484 --> 00:01:33,918
Tracy was gonna not have it.

36
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:35,450
So, basically, I went away to college

37
00:01:35,484 --> 00:01:37,651
And that was that.

38
00:01:37,684 --> 00:01:39,784
Only that wasn't that.

39
00:01:41,384 --> 00:01:43,851
Apparently tracy... didn't

40
00:01:43,884 --> 00:01:45,684
Not have it.

41
00:01:45,717 --> 00:01:47,350
She had it.

42
00:01:49,183 --> 00:01:50,350
A baby boy.

43
00:01:50,384 --> 00:01:52,384
She put him up for adoption.

44
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:56,784
-You have a son? -no.

45
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,018
Another son. a second son.

46
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,918
I already have a son.

47
00:02:02,717 --> 00:02:06,551
Exactly how long have you known about this second son?

48
00:02:07,784 --> 00:02:09,284
Not long. at all

49
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:11,384
We found out about two months ago.

50
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:13,117
You've known about this for two months?

51
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,984
All I can say is that I love you guys.

52
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:18,417
I love this family,

53
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,117
And this news doesn't change any of that.

54
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,551
I have no interest in digging up the past.

55
00:02:24,584 --> 00:02:26,317
So why are you telling us now?

56
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,083
Because tracy clark

57
00:02:28,117 --> 00:02:30,150
Is interested in digging up the past.

58
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,183
She's already hired a private investigator,

59
00:02:32,217 --> 00:02:35,083
And she is planning on telling naomi.

60
00:02:35,117 --> 00:02:38,317
So you wanted to, you know, fill us in on your little secret

61
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,484
Before the whole world knew.

62
00:02:39,517 --> 00:02:40,918
No secret.

63
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:43,183
You are my daughter.

64
00:02:43,217 --> 00:02:44,083
You are my son.

65
00:02:44,117 --> 00:02:45,517
This is my family.

66
00:02:45,551 --> 00:02:47,617
This is what is important to me.

67
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:50,517
I'm just really hoping that

68
00:02:50,551 --> 00:02:52,350
This doesn't affect us in any way.

69
00:02:52,384 --> 00:02:54,284
Okay?

70
00:02:57,951 --> 00:02:58,918
So?

71
00:02:58,951 --> 00:03:00,551
So...

72
00:03:00,584 --> 00:03:02,217
Dixon, what are you thinking?

73
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:07,951
Well, ac-actually, I'm thinking I gotta go to school.

74
00:03:07,984 --> 00:03:10,083
Annie?

75
00:03:10,117 --> 00:03:11,417
Yeah. school.

76
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,584
Better go.

77
00:03:17,117 --> 00:03:18,984
So? so.

78
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:20,317
How do you think that went?

79
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,784
Um... it... could've been worse.

80
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,050
Ugh! what?!

81
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:36,884
"i-i'm really hoping that this doesn't affect us in any way."

82
00:03:36,918 --> 00:03:38,617
It's like, what did he do?

83
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,050
Did he practice last night in front of a mirror?

84
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:41,217
Like, really?

85
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,117
Maybe he was, you know, nervous

86
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,984
About it or something, you know? yeah.

87
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:47,817
Well, he had about two months to prepare for it.

88
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:49,817
Come on. cut the guy a little bit of slack.

89
00:03:49,851 --> 00:03:52,250
Face it-- dad's a hypocrite.

90
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:54,417
He tells us not to have sex, but when he was

91
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,851
In high school he got tracy pregnant.

92
00:03:55,884 --> 00:03:57,250
Okay, plus, did you see

93
00:03:57,284 --> 00:03:59,651
The way he kept, like, glancing at mom the entire time

94
00:03:59,684 --> 00:04:00,584
and what was she doing, holding his cue cards?

95
00:04:00,617 --> 00:04:01,918
All right, um...

96
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:03,851
For the record here, I just need to know.

97
00:04:03,884 --> 00:04:06,484
Are you mad at him because he rehearsed what he was

98
00:04:06,517 --> 00:04:08,417
Gonna say? because he has a son?

99
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,284
Because he's a hypocrite? or, d, all of the above?

100
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,651
Doesn't this bug you? at all?

101
00:04:21,117 --> 00:04:22,751
It's freaky.

102
00:04:22,784 --> 00:04:24,517
All right? but I'm cool.

103
00:04:27,651 --> 00:04:31,450
So, half your brother, and half naomi's?

104
00:04:31,484 --> 00:04:34,784
Yeah, but it's not like he's half her and half me.

105
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:37,784
You're making it sound like some weird mythological creature,

106
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:39,784
Like a minotaur or mermaid or something.

107
00:04:39,817 --> 00:04:41,183
Well, it's weird, though.

108
00:04:41,217 --> 00:04:42,784
Yeah, it's a hundred percent weird,

109
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:46,117
And it certainly complicates things between naomi and me--

110
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,684
Which weren't not complicated before.

111
00:04:48,717 --> 00:04:52,117
I mean, she asked me to not date you at homecoming.

112
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,117
Well, it's none of her business who you date.

113
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,784
Yeah, I know, but...

114
00:04:55,817 --> 00:04:58,784
Well, we're kind of at a fork in the road here. I mean...

115
00:04:58,817 --> 00:05:00,884
Should you and me be you and me?

116
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:03,050
Or should we be you and me?

117
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,050
You know what I think?

118
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,684
What?

119
00:05:06,717 --> 00:05:10,217
Maybe we should try to keep our relationship on the d.l. for a few weeks.

120
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,150
You want to hide that we're seeing each other?

121
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:16,317
Look, I want us to be you and me,

122
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,150
But I think if we act like we're just you and me

123
00:05:19,183 --> 00:05:20,851
For a little while, it'll make things easier with naomi

124
00:05:20,884 --> 00:05:23,684
and that'll give her time to hook up with some other guy

125
00:05:23,717 --> 00:05:25,250
And she'll forget all about us.

126
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,651
Okay.

127
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,417
Yeah, that's another path... in the road.

128
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,018
Think about it this way.

129
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,551
We'll get to make out in secret places.

130
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,050
Ethan.

131
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,050
Oh, it's killing me. I'm so close to you, yet

132
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,817
I-- sss!-- can't touch you. shut up.

133
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:41,150
Hey, you want to hang out after school?

134
00:05:41,183 --> 00:05:42,717
We can be you and me after school.

135
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:44,584
I really want to be you and me, annie.

136
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:46,117
Me, too, ethan.

137
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,250
All right, fine. go away.

138
00:05:47,284 --> 00:05:48,784
I'll see you later.

139
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:49,984
Hey, there. hi.

140
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:54,851
Don't tell me you're trying to be the rebound girl.

141
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:56,317
With ethan? me?

142
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,717
No. no rebounds.

143
00:05:57,751 --> 00:06:00,884
Not me. I'm going to let that ball bounce right off the hoop.

144
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:01,884
Smart.

145
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:02,884
Smart girl.

146
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:06,717
So dixon told me about the new brother.

147
00:06:06,751 --> 00:06:07,817
That's intense.

148
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:09,217
Understatement.

149
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,684
Well, I figured maybe you want

150
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:12,117
To blow off some steam, get away

151
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,417
From the parental units for a night?

152
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,284
Mmm. what you have in mind?

153
00:06:15,317 --> 00:06:17,617
Well, kelly's coming back this weekend,

154
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:19,951
And I have to take advantage of my last nights of freedom

155
00:06:19,984 --> 00:06:22,018
So I'm thinking-- slumber party at my house.

156
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,250
All right, I mean, it sounds a little pg-13, but...

157
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:27,417
No! no, it'll be fun, and I would love to get away

158
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,951
From it all-- and by "it all," I mean my family.

159
00:06:29,984 --> 00:06:31,517
I'm definitely in.

160
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,651
So how are we doing?

161
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:44,217
Great. except,

162
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,317
Everyone's staring at me like I forgot to wear pants.

163
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,350
I went to rehab. now I'm out, so what's the big deal?

164
00:06:49,384 --> 00:06:51,250
I think they're just checking out your cute hat.

165
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:54,450
Thanks.

166
00:06:54,484 --> 00:06:56,751
It's uh... very pete doherty.

167
00:06:56,784 --> 00:07:00,083
In a, in a, in a feminine , non-skanky

168
00:07:00,117 --> 00:07:02,617
Uh, british guy sort of way.

169
00:07:02,651 --> 00:07:04,484
Thanks, navid.

170
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,417
Jelly beans?

171
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,117
You brought me jelly beans?

172
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,918
Yeah. I was just feeling that, you know, you might...

173
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:14,484
Deal with today better if, you know, you had some jelly beans.

174
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,083
Either that or you'll just get high off the sugar.

175
00:07:16,117 --> 00:07:17,517
I-i can't believe

176
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:18,951
I just said "high" be-be-because you,

177
00:07:18,984 --> 00:07:19,951
You wouldn't get high.

178
00:07:19,984 --> 00:07:22,284
It's okay.

179
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,817
I like jelly beans.

180
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:25,651
What's your favorite flavor?

181
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,484
Popcorn.

182
00:07:28,517 --> 00:07:29,751
The most disgusting jelly bean

183
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:30,851
Ever known to mankind?

184
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,784
Uh, it's buttery and delicious.

185
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:35,250
Okay, I was just about to say "just like you,"

186
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:37,150
And then I changed my mind.

187
00:07:37,183 --> 00:07:38,517
And then you somehow managed to say it anyway?

188
00:07:38,551 --> 00:07:39,484
True. ah...

189
00:07:39,517 --> 00:07:42,684
Mmm. isn't that yummy?

190
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:44,884
I gotta go to class.

191
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:49,183
"buttery and delicious."

192
00:07:49,217 --> 00:07:50,984
Seriously, navid, "buttery and delicious"?

193
00:07:51,018 --> 00:07:52,284
That's all you could think of?

194
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,651
Hey. can we talk?

195
00:07:57,684 --> 00:07:59,018
Annie?

196
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,018
-Naomi! -oh, can't talk.

197
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,350
Geometry quiz. gotta figure out why a square is a rectangle

198
00:08:08,384 --> 00:08:09,918
But not every rectangle's a square.

199
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,784
So. your dad and my mommy,

200
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:16,183
Doing the nasty...are you as grossed out as I am?

201
00:08:16,217 --> 00:08:19,384
Yeah. I'm guessing I'm a little bit more grossed out than you.

202
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,083
So when did she tell you?

203
00:08:21,117 --> 00:08:22,751
Oh, you know, at breakfast.

204
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:25,890
She was all, "darling, good morning.

205
00:08:25,891 --> 00:08:26,817
Could you pass the probiotic yogurt?

206
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:29,417
Oh, and by the way, you have a brother."

207
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,551
Parents are clueless.

208
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:32,250
No kidding.

209
00:08:33,784 --> 00:08:35,018
Hey, you bummed out about it?

210
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,584
It's just... whatever.

211
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,417
Well, you know what helps me when I'm bumming?

212
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,083
Jimmy choo.

213
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:42,751
Chinese food?

214
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:43,918
Oh, god.

215
00:08:43,951 --> 00:08:45,183
Oh, kansas.

216
00:08:45,217 --> 00:08:47,584
No. jimmy choo shoes.

217
00:08:47,617 --> 00:08:49,717
Oh. god's gift to women.

218
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:51,684
What are you doing after school?

219
00:08:51,717 --> 00:08:56,918
Today? um... today after school, i, me, um...

220
00:08:56,951 --> 00:08:58,317
Today I'm, I'm, um...

221
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,117
Are you okay? are you having a stroke?

222
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,984
No, i... i...

223
00:09:04,018 --> 00:09:07,384
Have no plans at all.

224
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:09,617
No plans? what happened to "you and me"?

225
00:09:09,651 --> 00:09:11,851
Yeah. I guess I panicked. I mean, all of a sudden

226
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,884
My mind was just a snowy snowscape of blank.

227
00:09:13,918 --> 00:09:16,684
And, I don't know... maybe this d.l. business

228
00:09:16,717 --> 00:09:17,984
Just isn't my cup of tea.

229
00:09:18,018 --> 00:09:19,250
No, no, it's cool, it's cool.

230
00:09:19,284 --> 00:09:20,517
You just got to be prepared

231
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:21,784
In case naomi asks you to do something.

232
00:09:21,817 --> 00:09:23,083
You're an actress.

233
00:09:23,117 --> 00:09:24,617
Let's rehearse, okay?

234
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:26,150
Okay, I'm, I'm naomi.

235
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:27,918
Why, naomi, you're looking rather butch today.

236
00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:29,384
Okay, shh...

237
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:31,384
Just give me a second while I get into character here.

238
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:32,817
Naomi.

239
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:34,050
Okay.

240
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,150
Hey, annie, what do you say after school

241
00:09:37,183 --> 00:09:39,083
We, uh, hit up the polo lounge

242
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:41,217
And you can watch me blow off david spade for the 80th time?

243
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,450
No, naomi,

244
00:09:42,484 --> 00:09:43,484
I'm sorry.

245
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:44,651
I'm busy.

246
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:45,984
See, there it is, there it is, okay.

247
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,083
So next time it's you and me.

248
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,217
I invited adrianna, by the way.

249
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,684
I don't know if she's gonna come, but...

250
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,050
That's very sweet of you.

251
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,250
Trying to be a girl's girl.

252
00:10:20,284 --> 00:10:21,417
It's a little new to me.

253
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,651
Hey, naomi,

254
00:10:22,684 --> 00:10:24,317
Do you want to come to a slumber party

255
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,450
At my house tonight?

256
00:10:25,484 --> 00:10:26,717
Kelly's still out of town,

257
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,883
And we got to take advantage.

258
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,083
A slumber party?

259
00:10:29,117 --> 00:10:30,550
How retro of you.

260
00:10:30,584 --> 00:10:31,916
What are you gonna do, braid each other's hair

261
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,450
And put on face masks?

262
00:10:33,484 --> 00:10:34,883
Well, you don't have to come if you don't want.

263
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,284
Oh, no, I'll be there,

264
00:10:36,317 --> 00:10:37,584
I'm just gonna bring my own face mask.

265
00:10:37,617 --> 00:10:38,983
These pores deserve the very best.

266
00:10:39,017 --> 00:10:40,250
Plus, I really have to get to know

267
00:10:40,284 --> 00:10:43,651
This family of mine, don't i? right, sis?

268
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,250
You can wear your new jimmy choos.

269
00:10:45,284 --> 00:10:47,017
-Sure, -sis...

270
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,816
Hey, we should totally play truth or dare.

271
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,684
That way, I can get to know everything

272
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,550
About this new sister of mine.

273
00:10:57,717 --> 00:11:01,317
Penny for your thoughts.

274
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,850
A penny... in beverly hills?

275
00:11:03,883 --> 00:11:05,850
We're in a recession.

276
00:11:05,883 --> 00:11:09,584
Come on. what are you thinking about?

277
00:11:09,617 --> 00:11:11,584
About my dad's laugh.

278
00:11:11,617 --> 00:11:13,617
Is that a poem or something?

279
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:15,150
'cause I like it.

280
00:11:15,183 --> 00:11:17,050
Whenever annie laughs, you know, people always say,

281
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,584
"oh, she sounds just like her mother."

282
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,651
Well, now I know that somebody out there...

283
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,284
Who has your dad's laugh?

284
00:11:27,317 --> 00:11:29,484
I don't need his laugh. I got my own laugh.

285
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:33,883
Yeah, and your laugh probably sounds like your birth dad's.

286
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,083
Yeah, maybe.

287
00:11:35,117 --> 00:11:36,751
You know,

288
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:39,083
I've been wanting to ask you about your adoption,

289
00:11:39,117 --> 00:11:41,816
But I never really knew when was the right time.

290
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,484
Well, I don't feel bad talking about it.

291
00:11:44,517 --> 00:11:46,783
I used to live with my grandmother in brooklyn.

292
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:49,117
Dad wasn't in the picture...addiction problems.

293
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,717
So when my grandmother died,

294
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,350
I moved to kansas to be with my mom.

295
00:11:53,384 --> 00:11:54,684
So you knew your birth mother?

296
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:00,950
Unfortunately, she was crazy.

297
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:03,617
Not so big on taking medication, so long story short,

298
00:12:03,651 --> 00:12:05,083
Social services came

299
00:12:05,117 --> 00:12:06,617
And took me away.

300
00:12:06,651 --> 00:12:08,083
Do you ever want to see her again?

301
00:12:08,117 --> 00:12:09,916
Nah.

302
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,983
I know the feeling.

303
00:12:13,017 --> 00:12:16,916
Come on now. it's cool.

304
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,484
I'm not about to play myself a violin.

305
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:22,350
I mean, look where I live.

306
00:12:22,384 --> 00:12:23,983
Look where I go to school.

307
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:27,384
My super-hot girlfriend, hmm?

308
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:29,816
And my family, I mean, come on.

309
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:30,916
Yeah.

310
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,284
Yeah, and I guess

311
00:12:32,317 --> 00:12:34,584
The wilsons saw how special you were.

312
00:12:34,617 --> 00:12:36,584
They knew they had to have you.

313
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:44,417
So, uh, when you gonna realize that you just have to have me?

314
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,017
Ooh, I don't know, soon.

315
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,916
Shut up.

316
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:54,550
Punctuality. I like that in a student.

317
00:12:54,584 --> 00:12:56,751
Thought I could get a couple seconds alone with you.

318
00:12:56,783 --> 00:12:59,284
Yeah, we can't really be alone here.

319
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:01,050
You know,

320
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,050
It's getting harder for me to see you every day in school.

321
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,816
How do you think I feel?

322
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,050
I'm supposed to be completely focused on this case,

323
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:10,083
And here I am thinking about one of my teachers.

324
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:12,950
Uh, that is why you can do the extra credit

325
00:13:12,983 --> 00:13:14,384
To make up the assignment.

326
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:16,450
That blows, mr. matthews.

327
00:13:16,484 --> 00:13:20,250
That's life, kimberly. take a seat.

328
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:26,217
So... I'm working on getting you

329
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,883
Those "party favors" you mentioned.

330
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,684
Cool.

331
00:13:30,717 --> 00:13:33,617
I'm, uh, looking forward to "celebrating."

332
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:44,288
I don't love slumber parties.

333
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:45,954
You still have to come, ade.

334
00:13:45,988 --> 00:13:47,787
I don't know. I got my meeting

335
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:49,888
Students against destructive decisions.

336
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,487
It's one of my preconditions for coming back and...

337
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,388
Sadd?

338
00:13:55,421 --> 00:13:57,021
Sadd is right.

339
00:13:57,363 --> 00:13:58,829
Okay, so you'll come after. fantastic.

340
00:13:58,862 --> 00:14:00,162
I don't know, though.

341
00:14:00,196 --> 00:14:01,629
If you guys are drinking,

342
00:14:01,662 --> 00:14:02,829
I don't want to be the downer.

343
00:14:02,862 --> 00:14:04,296
You're being a downer now.

344
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:05,829
The party's not gonna be all booze.

345
00:14:05,862 --> 00:14:07,562
It's about ice cream and cookie dough and face masks.

346
00:14:07,595 --> 00:14:08,896
It'll be really cute.

347
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:10,062
There you go! hey!

348
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:11,528
These are for you.

349
00:14:11,562 --> 00:14:13,029
I sorted out just the popcorns.

350
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:14,462
You sorted jelly beans for me?

351
00:14:14,495 --> 00:14:16,263
Yeah, well, I'm a man of many talents,

352
00:14:16,296 --> 00:14:18,562
The majority of which are rather useless.

353
00:14:18,595 --> 00:14:20,162
Uh, I'll see you later?

354
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:30,429
Okay, this took hours of freaky jelly bean sorting. hello?

355
00:14:30,462 --> 00:14:33,295
He's either ocd or he wants to sleep with you.

356
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:35,762
He's just being dorky navid.

357
00:14:35,796 --> 00:14:38,329
Oh, yeah, well, dorky navid paid for your rehab.

358
00:14:38,362 --> 00:14:40,063
He wants something from you, clearly.

359
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:41,095
Whatever.

360
00:14:41,128 --> 00:14:42,596
You're so going to have to use

361
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:43,762
Your powers over him

362
00:14:43,796 --> 00:14:45,696
To get him to sort my closet.

363
00:14:45,729 --> 00:14:46,896
Color code.

364
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,495
Nnaomi, Que pasa?

365
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:50,262
What are you doing tonight?

366
00:14:50,295 --> 00:14:52,629
Oh, I have a date. mama celeste.

367
00:14:52,662 --> 00:14:53,796
You're eating pizza?

368
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:54,696
Mm-hmm.

369
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:56,762
And you can't reschedule?

370
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,729
Oh, no, it would have to be something really special.

371
00:15:01,729 --> 00:15:04,329
You're making that guy run in so many circles

372
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,862
He's gonna get dizzy.

373
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:07,829
Mm-hmm, and I'm not stopping till he's sorting

374
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:09,429
The mikes from the ikes and the goods from the plenties.

375
00:15:17,996 --> 00:15:20,162
Hey, got a call from our credit card company.

376
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:23,295
They said there was some unusual activity on the card.

377
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:25,963
Quite a significant amount of unusual activity.

378
00:15:25,996 --> 00:15:27,963
You know anything about that?

379
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:29,362
Sounds unusual.

380
00:15:31,228 --> 00:15:34,063
I kind of bought some boots.

381
00:15:34,095 --> 00:15:37,495
Annie, that's an emergency card.

382
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:39,462
I really needed boots?

383
00:15:39,495 --> 00:15:41,195
These?

384
00:15:41,228 --> 00:15:42,963
Items of footwear?

385
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:44,696
They cost as much as a small car.

386
00:15:44,729 --> 00:15:48,262
What is this? where are you going?

387
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:50,295
Silver's having a sleepover at her sister's house.

388
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:52,095
I thought kelly was still out of town.

389
00:15:53,228 --> 00:15:54,829
No. no, you can't stay there

390
00:15:54,862 --> 00:15:56,696
If there's not going to be an adult around.

391
00:15:56,729 --> 00:15:58,696
Oh, come on, dad!

392
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:00,329
Sorry, no party.

393
00:16:00,362 --> 00:16:01,996
It's a slumber party.

394
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:03,629
It's a bunch of girls sitting around watching movies

395
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,329
And eating pizza-- I'm nearly 16 years old!

396
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:08,228
When you were my age, you were making babies.

397
00:16:11,162 --> 00:16:15,696
Annie, you are not going to the party.

398
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:17,128
Rules are rules.

399
00:16:17,162 --> 00:16:18,829
And, and these boots, they're going back.

400
00:16:18,862 --> 00:16:20,128
No way!

401
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:22,495
Yes... way.

402
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:52,729
Are you stalking me?

403
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,262
Because I'm over this whole

404
00:16:54,295 --> 00:16:55,629
"finding stalkers attractive" thing.

405
00:16:55,662 --> 00:16:57,095
No, no, no, I thought

406
00:16:57,128 --> 00:16:58,629
That maybe you'd want to go get

407
00:16:58,662 --> 00:17:00,095
Something to eat after your meeting.

408
00:17:00,128 --> 00:17:01,596
Yeah, I don't know. come on.

409
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:02,762
Give a guy a break.

410
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:04,462
Those were gourmet jelly beans

411
00:17:04,495 --> 00:17:05,929
And I got carpal tunnel from sorting. you owe me.

412
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:09,629
Right. I owe you.

413
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,262
Annie!

414
00:17:19,729 --> 00:17:23,162
That's the second time she snuck out since we moved here.

415
00:17:23,195 --> 00:17:25,029
We know she's at silver's.

416
00:17:25,063 --> 00:17:26,729
Let her stay there for the night.

417
00:17:26,762 --> 00:17:28,262
No way. we didn't give her permission.

418
00:17:28,295 --> 00:17:30,162
We just dropped a huge bomb on her.

419
00:17:30,195 --> 00:17:31,063
She's acting out.

420
00:17:32,095 --> 00:17:34,762
She won't talk to me.

421
00:17:34,796 --> 00:17:37,462
Harry, when she's ready to talk to you, she will.

422
00:17:38,762 --> 00:17:40,228
We have to trust her.

423
00:17:40,262 --> 00:17:41,262
Cheers.

424
00:17:46,862 --> 00:17:47,896
Yeah!

425
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:48,762
Lime!

426
00:17:48,796 --> 00:17:49,562
Mm...

427
00:17:52,262 --> 00:17:53,395
Way to go, kansas.

428
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,367
You sure you don't want another one?

429
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,601
I am done for the night.

430
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:02,733
Okay, annie?

431
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:05,666
Mm, s-t-l me.

432
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,867
We're out of lime.

433
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,766
Then just "t" me, I guess.

434
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,000
It works.

435
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:13,367
All right.

436
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,234
Cheers.

437
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:26,033
We so should do this at my birthday party.

438
00:18:26,067 --> 00:18:28,534
What party? my 16th birthday party.

439
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:31,367
My folks said I can invite anybody that I want.

440
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,501
I don't think the 'rents meant that you could invite

441
00:18:33,534 --> 00:18:34,833
Mr. tequila here.

442
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:37,200
Yeah, no.

443
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:40,434
Ooh, I got it.

444
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:41,567
We should play a game. here.

445
00:18:41,601 --> 00:18:44,234
Twister! lame.

446
00:18:44,267 --> 00:18:46,733
Hello? you don't play twister unless there's guys around.

447
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:48,067
Why would you entangle your limbs with another girl's

448
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,601
Unless a boy's watching?

449
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:51,666
Hey, I'm glad you could make it. thanks for coming.

450
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,567
Adrianna!

451
00:18:53,601 --> 00:18:55,601
You have to come to my birthday party, okay?

452
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:56,733
Drunk?

453
00:18:56,766 --> 00:18:58,134
Getting there.

454
00:18:58,167 --> 00:18:59,733
I never.

455
00:18:59,766 --> 00:19:01,467
What are you talking about?

456
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:02,833
You've been drunk, like, a million billion times.

457
00:19:02,867 --> 00:19:05,867
Okay, kansas, "i never" is a game.

458
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,234
All right, so, I say

459
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:09,933
Something that I've never done

460
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:12,534
And whoever has, takes a drink.

461
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:15,100
I'm gonna start.

462
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:18,434
I have never... had sex before.

463
00:19:24,267 --> 00:19:26,167
Okay, what are you waiting for? dixon's adorable.

464
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,666
Okay, dixon's sister

465
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,666
In the room and getting nauseous.

466
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,033
I'm just waiting for the right time is all.

467
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:35,267
Oh, please, it's not like angels start singing.

468
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,933
Right? you go.

469
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:40,100
Okay, my turn. I've never...

470
00:19:41,501 --> 00:19:44,300
I have never been in love.

471
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:50,601
Really? never?

472
00:19:50,633 --> 00:19:52,700
Nope. don't get sappy about it.

473
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,434
Annie, your turn.

474
00:19:55,467 --> 00:20:00,367
I... I've never been drunk.

475
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,967
Drink, drink, drink, drink.

476
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,833
You know, when dixon first came to live with us,

477
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:15,534
I completely flipped out.

478
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:16,900
I actually fantasized

479
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:18,567
About putting him in a cardboard box

480
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:20,666
And mailing him off to taiwan.

481
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,601
I don't know. I guess I thought, like, my parents

482
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:27,067
Would love him more or something.

483
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,800
I still feel crappy about it.

484
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,234
Meanwhile, my darling sister won't even answer my calls.

485
00:20:31,267 --> 00:20:32,567
It's awesome.

486
00:20:32,601 --> 00:20:34,300
I was kind of hoping to start fresh

487
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:35,567
With that new brother of ours.

488
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:36,334
What?

489
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:37,733
You know, my dad's been

490
00:20:37,766 --> 00:20:39,434
Cheating on my mom for a few years.

491
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:42,134
My mother tramps around like a pussycat doll,

492
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:44,833
And god forbid I'd ever want to talk to my sister about it.

493
00:20:44,867 --> 00:20:47,567
I was kind of hoping to have a relationship with someone

494
00:20:47,601 --> 00:20:48,833
Who doesn't make me

495
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:50,434
Want to scream all the time.

496
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:52,933
Sometimes, I just, you know, feel so alone.

497
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:54,334
Hey, you're not alone. you have me.

498
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:56,300
And these bitches, right?

499
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:59,867
Holy moly!

500
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,633
My shirt totally matches your nail polish

501
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:03,933
Perfectly!

502
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:06,167
Holy moly, kansas!

503
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,733
You're right, it does.

504
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,033
Let's trade shirts.

505
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:11,100
Okay.

506
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:20,134
Yours... and mine.

507
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:21,367
All right.

508
00:21:22,334 --> 00:21:23,434
Hey, hey! whoa!

509
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:25,334
Come on. annie, shirt on!

510
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,467
No boys!

511
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:28,666
What, uh, kind of party is this?

512
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,601
Dixon!

513
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:31,766
Zip me.

514
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:38,967
I am so sorry that I wanted to mail you to taiwan.

515
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,300
Are you drunk?

516
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:42,430
S.t.l., baby! whoo!

517
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,833
Hi, ethan! hey.

518
00:21:45,867 --> 00:21:47,267
Okay, um...

519
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,700
Are you gonna come to my birthday party next week?

520
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:50,267
Everybody's invited!

521
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,334
Yes.

522
00:21:52,367 --> 00:21:53,733
Yes.

523
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:57,933
You're a mess.

524
00:21:57,967 --> 00:22:00,700
Hi.

525
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:03,000
Word on the street is there's a party going on.

526
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:05,200
Did you tell people I was having a party?

527
00:22:05,234 --> 00:22:08,200
Naw, I just told navid and maybe a couple other people.

528
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:13,167
Oh, there's boys--

529
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,234
Now I have to give a crap what I look like.

530
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:30,334
You made it.

531
00:22:30,367 --> 00:22:31,800
I got your text.

532
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,666
I'm not one to miss a party.

533
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,167
Thought you might be thirsty.

534
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,100
I thought you were going to find me something stronger.

535
00:22:39,134 --> 00:22:42,833
Uh, yeah, no trouble, no trouble.

536
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,534
I got you covered. be right back.

537
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:49,900
Hey, adrianna.

538
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:52,534
So...

539
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:54,334
We should celebrate.

540
00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:56,467
Celebrate what?

541
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,400
Your testicles have finally dropped?

542
00:22:58,434 --> 00:23:00,567
No.

543
00:23:00,601 --> 00:23:02,833
You getting out of rehab.

544
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:12,434
So, you just couldn't stay away from me,

545
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:14,534
Could you?

546
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,601
You know it's like mother hubbard territory in here, right?

547
00:23:16,633 --> 00:23:18,400
This girl's got nothing to eat.

548
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:21,567
What, so you're a food snob or something?

549
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:23,367
I prefer epicurean.

550
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,000
And you're cooking?

551
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:29,700
Yeah. you just gonna stand there or you gonna help me out?

552
00:23:31,134 --> 00:23:32,467
Yo, ozzie.

553
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:34,134
Naomi, this is my buddy, julio.

554
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:35,733
Hey, what's up? hola.

555
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:38,567
who was that?

556
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:42,000
Naomi, it's ozzie.

557
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:44,033
Yes, it is.

558
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:46,167
And that's julio, his friend. hi.

559
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,100
And this is us going.

560
00:23:48,134 --> 00:23:49,700
Excuse us for a second.

561
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,334
Darling, listen. very important.

562
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:56,666
Julio is ozzie's as his wingman; I need you to be my winggirl.

563
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,733
Okay, um, you want me to be your ring girl...

564
00:23:59,766 --> 00:24:01,800
No, no, no, wing... winggirl.

565
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,000
Okay. listen.

566
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:04,633
Julio's cute, right? he's cute.

567
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,567
You're single. help me out here.

568
00:24:06,601 --> 00:24:10,601
Um, he's cute, and I am very single.

569
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:13,234
Not a boyfriend in sight.

570
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:15,601
Perfect, fabulous. okay, so what you're

571
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:19,033
Going to do is keep julio very busy while naomi get's ozzie alone.

572
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:20,534
Okay. I am her winggirl.

573
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:23,867
Just winging it. hello.

574
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:38,033
What's up, adrianna?

575
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:43,167
Okay, I hope this doesn't come off as totally tacky,

576
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,700
But could you hook me up with your dealer?

577
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:48,200
I don't do drugs anymore.

578
00:24:48,234 --> 00:24:52,601
So you don't really need your dealer's number, do you?

579
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,933
Fine.

580
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,267
I heard the slumber party turned into a party party,

581
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,633
So I thought I'd come by and check it out.

582
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:13,234
How are you doing? I'm cool.

583
00:25:13,267 --> 00:25:15,200
Okay, uh... do you want to go somewhere

584
00:25:15,234 --> 00:25:17,800
A little more private like upstairs?

585
00:25:19,033 --> 00:25:20,766
Fine.

586
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,467
Yeah, let's go.

587
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:24,467
Okay... cool.

588
00:25:29,501 --> 00:25:31,367
Mmm. this is the most amazing

589
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,867
Grilled cheese I have ever had in my life.

590
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,633
You're just drunk.

591
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,766
No, I'm not, actually.

592
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,534
So, who taught you how to cook?

593
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:40,800
My dad.

594
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:42,367
He worked in a bunch of kitchens,

595
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,134
Saved his money and opened

596
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,067
A hole in the wall in echo park.

597
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,800
Now that hole in the wall just got written up in la weekly,

598
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:50,234
So we're booked six weeks in advance.

599
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:52,900
Awesome.

600
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:55,167
You know, you're not like anybody at school.

601
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,467
I'm like a lot of people at school.

602
00:25:58,501 --> 00:26:00,267
Just not people you hang out with.

603
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,134
You should travel outside your comfort zone.

604
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:04,367
Oh, is that what you're trying to do?

605
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,567
Throw me off my game?

606
00:26:06,601 --> 00:26:08,200
Revealing choice of words.

607
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:11,733
You like games, huh?

608
00:26:11,766 --> 00:26:15,100
Oh, you know, they're... pretty entertaining.

609
00:26:15,134 --> 00:26:18,501
I don't like games, and I don't like people who play games.

610
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:22,867
Yo, this party's dead, let's bounce.

611
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,700
What happened to annie? your girl?

612
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:27,334
Dissed me-- let's get out of here.

613
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:29,933
All right. let's get out of here.

614
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:45,200
Annie.

615
00:26:46,234 --> 00:26:48,167
Annie!

616
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:55,134
I'm really supposed to be chatting with what's-his-name right now.

617
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:56,400
Which what's-his-name? huh?

618
00:26:56,434 --> 00:26:57,900
Who? julio.

619
00:26:57,933 --> 00:26:59,167
Who's julio?

620
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,367
What's-his-name.

621
00:27:16,562 --> 00:27:18,628
Naomi I am so happy

622
00:27:18,662 --> 00:27:20,662
You decided to come to my party.

623
00:27:20,695 --> 00:27:22,562
I've really missed hanging out with you.

624
00:27:22,595 --> 00:27:25,261
Well, that's pathetic... uh, but sweet.

625
00:27:25,295 --> 00:27:26,961
I've missed you too.

626
00:27:26,994 --> 00:27:29,128
Awesome. hey. why don't you catch me up

627
00:27:29,161 --> 00:27:31,228
On everything that's been going on, yeah?

628
00:28:13,075 --> 00:28:15,174
you're sexy.yeah.

629
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:22,174
I'm sleepy.

630
00:28:22,207 --> 00:28:24,341
Great.

631
00:28:26,174 --> 00:28:27,574
Okay.

632
00:28:27,608 --> 00:28:30,508
Okay, I'm... I'm gonna get you some water.

633
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:32,474
Water sounds delicious.

634
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:39,008
I'll just be here... waiting.

635
00:28:52,207 --> 00:28:54,274
I think I have a condom in my purse.

636
00:28:54,307 --> 00:28:55,608
I didn't think that was going to happen tonight.

637
00:28:57,307 --> 00:28:58,708
Okay, let's do this.

638
00:28:58,741 --> 00:29:00,274
What's going on?

639
00:29:00,307 --> 00:29:03,441
You wanted to have sex; let's have sex.

640
00:29:03,474 --> 00:29:05,741
But it's like you're not even into it.

641
00:29:05,775 --> 00:29:07,808
Come on, navid.

642
00:29:07,841 --> 00:29:09,708
I wasn't born yesterday.

643
00:29:09,741 --> 00:29:13,075
You covered my rehab, so I'm paying you back.

644
00:29:13,108 --> 00:29:14,775
Is that what this is about?

645
00:29:14,808 --> 00:29:17,441
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

646
00:29:17,474 --> 00:29:21,541
Okay, so because I paid for your rehab you think I expect sex?

647
00:29:21,574 --> 00:29:23,274
Is that the kind of guy you think I am?

648
00:29:23,307 --> 00:29:25,307
Kiss me.

649
00:29:25,341 --> 00:29:26,775
Oh my god.

650
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:28,474
You know what? no, I'm done.

651
00:29:28,508 --> 00:29:29,408
Navid, wait!

652
00:29:29,441 --> 00:29:31,374
No, I'm out of here.

653
00:29:31,408 --> 00:29:33,675
Sorry to waste your time.

654
00:29:45,374 --> 00:29:47,108
There you are!

655
00:29:50,142 --> 00:29:53,975
I'm warn you, this floor is very wobbly.

656
00:29:57,941 --> 00:29:59,307
Um... okay, what happened?

657
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:00,574
I thought you were going to be my...

658
00:30:00,608 --> 00:30:02,174
Wing girl.

659
00:30:02,207 --> 00:30:03,608
I'm sorry, naomi.

660
00:30:03,641 --> 00:30:05,474
It's okay.

661
00:30:05,508 --> 00:30:07,374
I just don't get ozzie.

662
00:30:07,408 --> 00:30:08,608
He's so weird.

663
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:10,808
One second, we're flirting,

664
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:13,075
He's cooking, and everything's cool, and then...

665
00:30:13,108 --> 00:30:17,474
All of sudden, he says, "i don't play games, I'm out of here."

666
00:30:17,508 --> 00:30:19,374
I think I'm gonna try something radical with ozzie.

667
00:30:19,408 --> 00:30:20,474
What's that?

668
00:30:20,508 --> 00:30:22,608
Honesty.

669
00:30:23,975 --> 00:30:27,274
It's not exactly me, per se.

670
00:30:28,341 --> 00:30:30,608
But I am sick of the lies.

671
00:30:30,641 --> 00:30:34,174
I  mean, my dad's having an affair... no one tells me.

672
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,941
Apparently, I have a brother.

673
00:30:35,975 --> 00:30:37,708
No one tells me.

674
00:30:37,741 --> 00:30:39,675
Everyone's so full of it.

675
00:30:41,008 --> 00:30:43,207
I'm really sick of being lied to.

676
00:30:44,408 --> 00:30:45,641
I feel terrible.

677
00:30:45,675 --> 00:30:48,941
I know. you do?

678
00:30:48,975 --> 00:30:50,875
About your dad? yeah.

679
00:30:50,908 --> 00:30:52,675
Sure, I get it.

680
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:55,374
I mean, it seemed like you really looked up to him.

681
00:30:55,408 --> 00:30:56,374
Yeah.

682
00:30:56,408 --> 00:30:57,808
I did.

683
00:30:57,841 --> 00:31:01,341
When I was little, I thought he was just like

684
00:31:01,374 --> 00:31:04,875
Superman or something.

685
00:31:04,908 --> 00:31:07,508
And he turned out to be a liar like all the rest.

686
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:09,307
Yeah. I don't like liars.

687
00:31:09,341 --> 00:31:11,975
Yeah, it's a bummer.

688
00:31:12,008 --> 00:31:14,775
Well, any-whoo,

689
00:31:14,808 --> 00:31:16,574
I'm going to go fix my makeup.

690
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:19,341
Apparently, there are still a bunch of boys around here.

691
00:31:24,307 --> 00:31:28,508
excuse me coming throug Hey, cutie...

692
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:31,008
I heard there was some shirt swapping

693
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:32,508
Going on earlier tonight.

694
00:31:32,541 --> 00:31:36,708
You want to switch shirts with me?

695
00:31:36,741 --> 00:31:38,441
Only if I can do your nails and makeup first.

696
00:31:38,474 --> 00:31:40,941
If that's what you're into.

697
00:31:40,975 --> 00:31:42,875
Oh, my god, get away from me.

698
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:53,875
We need to talk.

699
00:31:53,908 --> 00:31:56,307
Yeah, I've been looking for you.

700
00:31:56,341 --> 00:31:58,274
Yeah, I've been talking and thinking

701
00:31:58,307 --> 00:31:59,675
And we need to talk.

702
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:01,508
I can't lie like this.

703
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:03,158
Listen, annie,

704
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:04,775
let's talk about this tomorrow when you're sober.

705
00:32:04,808 --> 00:32:06,075
I'm not drunk.

706
00:32:06,108 --> 00:32:08,075
Actually, I think you are.

707
00:32:08,108 --> 00:32:10,108
Actually, no I'm not.

708
00:32:10,142 --> 00:32:11,808
I'm totally not.

709
00:32:13,608 --> 00:32:15,374
Wait... hold on.

710
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:23,908
Thanks for coming to get me.

711
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:25,641
How was the party? was it ragin'?

712
00:32:25,675 --> 00:32:27,307
Things were starting to get pretty wild.

713
00:32:27,341 --> 00:32:28,875
Should we do something about it, or...?

714
00:32:28,908 --> 00:32:29,674
I already called a colleague.

715
00:32:29,674 --> 00:32:30,441
hey, look at you

716
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,750
everybody, listen--

717
00:33:06,783 --> 00:33:07,716
party's over.

718
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,150
let's go. um...

719
00:33:09,184 --> 00:33:10,516
come on.

720
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,783
hey, um, dad...

721
00:33:12,817 --> 00:33:13,983
got a call from a colleague.

722
00:33:14,017 --> 00:33:15,483
said this party

723
00:33:15,516 --> 00:33:17,284
was out of control, and that annie was inebriated.

724
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,150
annie?

725
00:33:20,184 --> 00:33:21,650
drunk? what?

726
00:33:21,683 --> 00:33:22,917
uh, principal wilson,

727
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,483
we collected everybody's keys,

728
00:33:24,516 --> 00:33:27,650
and already called a bunch of cabs.

729
00:33:34,616 --> 00:33:36,750
oh, honey.

730
00:33:36,783 --> 00:33:38,750
oh, daddy...

731
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:40,683
i drank too much.

732
00:33:40,716 --> 00:33:43,217
yeah, i can see that.

733
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,050
oh, sweetheart, you stink.

734
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:47,583
i threw up.

735
00:33:47,616 --> 00:33:50,316
yeah, i figured.

736
00:33:50,349 --> 00:33:52,349
you okay?

737
00:33:52,383 --> 00:33:54,616
no.

738
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:58,917
no. i'm not okay.

739
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,783
it's your fault.

740
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:07,250
i'm not okay with you having a son.

741
00:34:07,284 --> 00:34:11,883
and i'm not okay that you kept him a secret from us.

742
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:13,817
and i know... i know you didn't want it

743
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,483
to affect us, dad, but it...

744
00:34:15,516 --> 00:34:17,483
it affected me.

745
00:34:19,284 --> 00:34:23,550
and you weren't honest.

746
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:25,349
for two months you were a liar.

747
00:34:25,383 --> 00:34:28,250
and now i have to be honest,

748
00:34:28,284 --> 00:34:30,850
and i have to tell you that it made me

749
00:34:30,883 --> 00:34:33,683
so mad at you for not being honest,

750
00:34:33,716 --> 00:34:35,383
because secrets--

751
00:34:35,416 --> 00:34:37,850
they just make me feel so sick...

752
00:34:37,883 --> 00:34:39,250
and wobbly.

753
00:34:39,284 --> 00:34:43,483
and everything's a big mess now.

754
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:45,883
and i have vomit boots!

755
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,449
you have "vomit boots"?

756
00:34:47,483 --> 00:34:51,150
ah, you have vomit boots.

757
00:34:51,184 --> 00:34:52,817
oh, sweetheart,

758
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:56,349
i'm sorry that i wasn't honest.

759
00:34:56,383 --> 00:34:58,083
and i'm sorry that i acted

760
00:34:58,117 --> 00:35:01,449
like it wouldn't be a big deal.

761
00:35:01,483 --> 00:35:06,083
tried to do the right thing, and i didn't.

762
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:09,383
i'm not perfect, annie.

763
00:35:09,416 --> 00:35:11,716
i make mistakes.

764
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,616
that's okay.

765
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:20,883
are you going to let me get you out of here?

766
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:22,550
yes, please.

767
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:24,950
we're going to have to stand up.

768
00:35:24,983 --> 00:35:27,883
hey, daddy, tell me the truth--

769
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,817
am i in big trouble?

770
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:33,117
well, we all make mistakes.

771
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:36,883
hey, dad, i made another mistake.

772
00:35:36,917 --> 00:35:39,316
i cannot return these vomit boots.

773
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:40,850
yeah, i kind of figured that.

774
00:35:40,883 --> 00:35:43,284
hey, dad...

775
00:35:43,316 --> 00:35:45,516
you know who you remind me of?

776
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,550
who?

777
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:48,349
superman...

778
00:35:48,383 --> 00:35:49,783
only not so big into the tights,

779
00:35:49,817 --> 00:35:53,050
thank goodness.

780
00:36:05,883 --> 00:36:07,983
i want back on the lacrosse team, mr. matthews.

781
00:36:08,017 --> 00:36:10,316
my six-week suspension is up.

782
00:36:10,349 --> 00:36:12,316
that's true, george, but your grades are down,

783
00:36:12,349 --> 00:36:14,184
right, and you know the school policy.

784
00:36:14,217 --> 00:36:17,250
you need a 3.0 or higher to get

785
00:36:17,284 --> 00:36:18,550
back on the field.

786
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:19,716
then give me an "a" in your class.

787
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,083
why would i do that?

788
00:36:21,117 --> 00:36:23,516
oh, i can think of a pretty good reason.

789
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,583
he only saw us

790
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:26,117
in a car together.

791
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,583
teachers cannot be alone off campus with students.

792
00:36:28,616 --> 00:36:29,917
right, but...

793
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,516
kim's not a student.

794
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,716
i am as far as the kids know.

795
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,850
if anyone finds out who i am,

796
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:35,950
i could be in serious trouble.

797
00:36:35,983 --> 00:36:38,217
i'm sorry, ryan,

798
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,583
but i'm gonna have to ask you to take a paid leave

799
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:42,250
of absence, effective immediately.

800
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:44,250
this is my job, harry, my reputation.

801
00:36:44,284 --> 00:36:46,184
what are the students going to think?

802
00:36:46,217 --> 00:36:48,383
we will reinstate you as soon as kimberly's work

803
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:49,716
is done here.

804
00:36:51,117 --> 00:36:54,083
i'm sorry.

805
00:36:54,117 --> 00:36:55,383
i'm sorry, too, ryan.

806
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:57,284
this is not fair.

807
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:58,750
you know, you got to take responsibility

808
00:36:58,783 --> 00:36:59,983
for your actions here.

809
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,550
what you did-- it wasn't illegal, but...

810
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:02,883
it wasn't quite appropriate either.

811
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:20,284
can we talk?

812
00:37:21,683 --> 00:37:23,449
yeah.

813
00:37:28,616 --> 00:37:30,583
look, i didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

814
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:32,917
okay?

815
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,416
it's just nice guys aren't usually interested in me,

816
00:37:35,449 --> 00:37:37,683
and i thought...

817
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:39,083
that i was a sleazebag.

818
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:45,117
yeah. you know how many directors have lied to me and used me?

819
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,683
they act like these nice guys and...

820
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,683
you're a nice guy, navid,

821
00:37:51,716 --> 00:37:53,184
and i guess i got scared.

822
00:37:53,217 --> 00:37:54,750
hey, that's terrible,

823
00:37:54,783 --> 00:37:58,083
but sometimes a nice guy who acts like he likes you

824
00:37:58,117 --> 00:38:00,683
is just a nice guy who likes you.

825
00:38:00,716 --> 00:38:02,783
but you paid for my rehab.

826
00:38:02,817 --> 00:38:04,083
because i care about you.

827
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,349
no, i, i know that now.

828
00:38:07,383 --> 00:38:10,284
i just-- i guess...

829
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:11,550
if we're going to be together...

830
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:12,550
wait.

831
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:14,349
you want to be with me?

832
00:38:14,383 --> 00:38:16,950
well, yeah.

833
00:38:18,383 --> 00:38:22,050
i kind of like spending time with you and you're...

834
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:24,349
kind of an amazing kisser.

835
00:38:24,383 --> 00:38:26,117
i am?

836
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:30,883
but you don't, you don't have to do this.

837
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:33,483
you can, you can walk away right now.

838
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,750
how about we walk together?

839
00:38:50,683 --> 00:38:52,316
that was pretty sappy.

840
00:38:52,349 --> 00:38:55,516
yeah, it's one of the side effects of being a nice guy.

841
00:38:56,516 --> 00:38:59,083
i think i still have a hangover.

842
00:38:59,117 --> 00:39:00,184
yeah, you were a little...

843
00:39:00,217 --> 00:39:01,250
a lot.

844
00:39:01,284 --> 00:39:03,150
was a lot.

845
00:39:03,184 --> 00:39:06,316
so you wanted to talk?

846
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:10,516
yeah, um...

847
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,583
i don't want to keep us a secret anymore, ethan.

848
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:15,850
it's wrong to lie to naomi

849
00:39:15,883 --> 00:39:17,184
over and over again,

850
00:39:17,217 --> 00:39:18,817
and i think we just need to tell her

851
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,616
and we just need to accept

852
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,349
whatever consequences are going to come.

853
00:39:25,117 --> 00:39:26,850
please?

854
00:39:26,883 --> 00:39:29,416
okay.

855
00:39:30,449 --> 00:39:31,950
if that's what you want.

856
00:39:31,983 --> 00:39:33,550
yeah, that's what i want.

857
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:49,917
hi.

858
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:53,250
what's up?

859
00:39:53,284 --> 00:39:55,349
i don't want to play games with you.

860
00:39:56,917 --> 00:39:58,583
that's crafty.

861
00:39:58,616 --> 00:40:00,783
the "i don't want to play games" game.

862
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:02,217
i'm serious.

863
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,950
ozzie, i like you.

864
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,750
i'll tell you what. this is my number.

865
00:40:08,117 --> 00:40:09,750
you call me.

866
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:12,716
don't wait three days, don't wait a week.

867
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,483
just call me.

868
00:40:16,516 --> 00:40:18,750
okay.

869
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:42,117
hello?

870
00:40:44,284 --> 00:40:45,284
hello?

871
00:40:56,284 --> 00:40:58,454
In memory of Ronn Cooney  1937-2008
