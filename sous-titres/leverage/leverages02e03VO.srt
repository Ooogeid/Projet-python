1
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:15,268
Mr. Maranjian, please stand.

2
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:20,490
Do you have anything to say
before the court renders its sentence?

3
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:23,491
Perhaps an apology
to your victims here in court.

4
00:00:23,576 --> 00:00:26,932
I don't want to take up
any more of the court's time.

5
00:00:27,646 --> 00:00:28,769
Very well.

6
00:00:28,867 --> 00:00:32,004
Mr. Maranjian, you were
a hedge-fund manager...

7
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:36,082
who supported a lavish lifestyle
by robbing your clients blind...

8
00:00:36,298 --> 00:00:40,007
in some cases, wiping out
their entire life savings.

9
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:45,437
The money was never recovered,
and you've shown no remorse for your actions.

10
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,788
However,
the government has indicated...

11
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:54,339
that you have provided substantial assistance
in the prosecution of other cases.

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,847
With that in mind
and with credit for time served...

13
00:00:58,123 --> 00:01:01,724
the court hereby sentences you
to 18 months in prison.

14
00:01:01,865 --> 00:01:02,933
No!

15
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:09,267
Order!
Order!

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,275
Mr. Maranjian is hereby remanded into
the custody of the U.S. Marshal Service...

17
00:01:15,482 --> 00:01:18,955
to begin his incarceration
at Fort Walton Beach, Florida.

18
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,516
We're adjourned.

19
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,586
I can't believe it.

20
00:01:46,597 --> 00:01:47,911
Easy.

21
00:01:50,503 --> 00:01:52,221
Come with me.

22
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:07,167
The rich and powerful,
they take what they want.

23
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,594
We steal it back for you.

24
00:02:12,687 --> 00:02:17,156
And sometimes, bad guys
make the best good guys.

25
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,644
We provide...

26
00:02:23,395 --> 00:02:25,602
You're lucky they just
gave you a warning, Ronald.

27
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,048
How do you know my name?

28
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:29,762
Oh, that. Yes, well,
I think this belongs to you.

29
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:31,724
- You guys cops?
- Uh, no. No.

30
00:02:31,725 --> 00:02:34,907
We are in the restitution business.
We're trying to help Eddie's clients.

31
00:02:34,908 --> 00:02:37,357
- A little late for that now.
- No, no, no, no.

32
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:40,631
The judge says the money
Eddie Maranjian stole is gone.

33
00:02:40,632 --> 00:02:44,656
We don't believe that. Eddie liquidated
$400,000 right before his trial.

34
00:02:44,657 --> 00:02:46,784
And it looks to us
like it's still in this town.

35
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:49,169
And we came here to find it
for you and the other victims.

36
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,232
Nobody wants to see this guy
just get a slap on the wrist, Ronald...

37
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:55,584
I mean, but killing him?
He's a thief, not a murder.

38
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:59,489
My sister Natalie, she wasn't
a big shot, you know?

39
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,991
She was a widow.

40
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,089
Her husband worked his whole life,
left her enough to live on.

41
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:06,871
Then she met Eddie.

42
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:11,171
He was smart, responsible,
and Armenian, like us.

43
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,456
Yeah, well,
they call these affinity crimes...

44
00:03:13,457 --> 00:03:16,930
people who prey on
fellow members of ethnic groups.

45
00:03:17,014 --> 00:03:21,011
Eddie took my sister's money.
Then she got sick.

46
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:25,986
Only she didn't see a doctor or tell anybody
because she didn't want to be a burden.

47
00:03:26,763 --> 00:03:31,354
My sister died in a hospital bed,
and it didn't have to happen.

48
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:35,988
But Eddie, oh,
he's just a thief, right?

49
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:45,424
Eddie's new address in Fort Walton Beach,
Florida, is the original "Club Fed".

50
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,915
He's got his own nine-hole golf course.
Vegan menu.

51
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:52,482
This dude can play frisbee with the guys
from Enron in the quadrangle.

52
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:55,433
I hate those guys.
18 months in a country club, this guy.

53
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:58,875
Yeah, and then when he gets done, he gets
to come home and collect his hidden cash.

54
00:03:58,876 --> 00:04:01,943
All right, so if this guy
is not afraid of prison, then...

55
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:05,579
what incentive does he have
to tell us where the cash is?

56
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,441
I'm thinking.

57
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:15,527
Nate, I hate to rush you, but Eddie goes
to the prison in an hour, so...

58
00:04:15,528 --> 00:04:18,434
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

59
00:04:29,654 --> 00:04:33,137
What are you more afraid of
than-- than prison?

60
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:34,480
Death?

61
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:38,727
And what are you more
afraid of than death?

62
00:04:47,303 --> 00:04:48,279
Oh.

63
00:04:49,897 --> 00:04:51,117
Nice suit, Eddie.

64
00:04:51,118 --> 00:04:55,273
Maybe when you get down there,
you can trade it for a pack of smokes.

65
00:04:56,672 --> 00:05:00,210
You think people handed me
their life savings because of a...

66
00:05:00,211 --> 00:05:01,416
because of a suit?

67
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:05,040
Are you gonna tell me it's
'cause you're a financial genius?

68
00:05:05,253 --> 00:05:08,750
I like you, Charlie.
You don't seem like a typical fed.

69
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,481
I'm gonna give you a little lesson
in hedge funds.

70
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:16,854
I don't put on a suit and say,
"Give me your money."

71
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:19,924
I do the opposite.
I disappear.

72
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:21,997
I become a rumor...

73
00:05:22,317 --> 00:05:25,791
an exclusive club
open only to select people.

74
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,745
People like your buddy Bob here.

75
00:05:29,065 --> 00:05:34,434
One day, you realize he's been in the club
for a while, making big returns.

76
00:05:34,922 --> 00:05:38,723
Bob, someone you know, respect...

77
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:42,732
That's the key.
Because now I've shifted your fear.

78
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:48,408
You're not scared
of losing money anymore.

79
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:52,014
You're scared of losing out
on making money.

80
00:05:53,944 --> 00:05:59,482
It's not about the suit, Charlie.
It's about shifting fear.

81
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:13,022
Not much chitchat between you two.
You lovebirds have a little tiff?

82
00:06:14,682 --> 00:06:17,730
- We just started working together.
- Don't talk to him.

83
00:06:17,731 --> 00:06:21,008
Lighten up, Bob.
I'm just making conversation.

84
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:27,057
You know,
we've all got our jobs to do.

85
00:06:27,245 --> 00:06:30,438
Your job is to babysit scumbags.

86
00:06:30,894 --> 00:06:34,105
And I--
I have to work on my slice.

87
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:47,333
What's the matter, Eddie,
don't like rats?

88
00:06:47,822 --> 00:06:52,203
Oh, but you haven't seen a rat
till you've been in a Florida prison.

89
00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:55,024
Just making conversation.

90
00:06:55,763 --> 00:06:59,950
Yeah, you want to converse with me, all right?
These guys, man. I told you...

91
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:02,333
- you got to stop talking to these guys.
- I know.

92
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:05,455
I took one of these guys just like him
down to Tallahassee once.

93
00:07:05,456 --> 00:07:06,205
Yeah.

94
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:09,634
I'm telling you, those rats are as big
as the baby gators down there.

95
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:11,947
Wait till he gets a good look at them.

96
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:15,093
Yeah.
You been down there yet?

97
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:22,020
Oh, great.

98
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,394
Thanks for taking a look at him, doctor.

99
00:07:31,488 --> 00:07:35,044
You got me out of jury duty.
I should be thanking you.

100
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,016
Pupils are dilated.

101
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:42,659
Mr. Maranjian.
Mr. Maranjian, what state are we in?

102
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:44,584
Massachusetts.

103
00:07:44,856 --> 00:07:46,514
What's your birthday?

104
00:07:47,304 --> 00:07:49,144
June... June 8th.

105
00:07:49,145 --> 00:07:51,858
No, no, no. Take it easy.
Take it easy. That's it.

106
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:56,181
- Did he suffer any head trauma?
- Yeah, he got punched out in court earlier.

107
00:07:56,182 --> 00:07:58,030
Oh, well...

108
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:03,638
I'd say he has a concussion. Of course,
I'll have to do an MRI to be sure.

109
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:06,371
Yeah, well, he can get one
at the prison infirmary.

110
00:08:06,372 --> 00:08:10,113
- Our flight leaves in about an hour.
- I don't think you understand. No, no.

111
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:14,351
He's not going anywhere. This is very serious.
This man could have a subdural hemorrhage.

112
00:08:14,352 --> 00:08:17,552
He is not cleared to fly
until I fully check him out.

113
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:20,847
I'm gonna make arrangements
for a transfer.

114
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:28,348
- Okay. So, what do we do now?
- Well, I just sent Eddie to the hospital, so...

115
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:30,798
let's go steal us a hospital.

116
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:39,182
So, let me get this straight.

117
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:40,577
- You're a doctor.
- Yeah.

118
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:42,523
What if someone asks you
to deliver a baby?

119
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:45,330
- I'd say I'm not an obstetrician.
- What? A what?

120
00:08:45,331 --> 00:08:46,984
- A baby doctor.
- Oh, well...

121
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,515
what if there's a train accident
and there's stretchers everywhere...

122
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:52,712
and someone points to you and says,
"Hey, you, help me with this sucking chest wound."

123
00:08:52,713 --> 00:08:56,249
I would stick my hand in the chest
and hope for the best.

124
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,085
Oh, you are so not operating on me.

125
00:08:58,086 --> 00:09:00,259
- Okay, do you have-- Do you have the list?
- Yeah

126
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,812
Yeah?
All right, go shopping.

127
00:09:37,512 --> 00:09:39,624
...jurisdiction order 23.

128
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:42,336
Hey.

129
00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:44,086
Hey.

130
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:47,105
I put speakers in Eddie's room
and every 3 feet down the hallway.

131
00:09:47,106 --> 00:09:51,882
So if you want to hear footsteps coming
toward you, you slide the cursor this way.

132
00:09:52,164 --> 00:09:53,997
And walking away...

133
00:09:54,673 --> 00:09:57,939
this way. I made you a master audio file
with all the stuff we recorded...

134
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,236
plus the sound effects. You mix them
any way you want. You're the deejay.

135
00:10:01,237 --> 00:10:02,659
- Looks good. Hey.
- Hey.

136
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,574
Are you sure there's no patients
on this floor?

137
00:10:04,575 --> 00:10:06,828
No. They use this place
for storage. We own it.

138
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:11,579
All right, well, here's the stuff from the van
plus almost everything from the list.

139
00:10:12,072 --> 00:10:16,488
And by the way, nurses haven't worn skirts
with white stockings since the '70s.

140
00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:18,148
- Sorry.
- Guys, listen up.

141
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:20,532
Eddie is here for an MRI.
That gives us two hours.

142
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:24,004
I don't need to tell you that's not a lot of time.
You might be playing multiple parts in this one.

143
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:26,746
Parker and I are the medical team.
Sophie, you're next door as the patient.

144
00:10:26,747 --> 00:10:28,552
- What are you doing?
- Eliot and Hardison--

145
00:10:28,553 --> 00:10:30,944
- This is my shirt.
- No, give me the shirt.

146
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:32,824
- Give me the shirt.
- Guys, guys.

147
00:10:32,825 --> 00:10:36,206
No, wait. I- I can't wear a size-16 neck.
Okay, I got to breathe.

148
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:39,643
I got to wear my scrubs underneath
the uniform. I need a bigger neck.

149
00:10:39,644 --> 00:10:44,763
Just keep your eye on the marshals, all right?
We got two hours starting... now. Go.

150
00:10:44,764 --> 00:10:47,263
- If you don't give me that shirt--
- Listen to me, son, you need those fingers...

151
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:49,863
to type on your
little keyboard, don't you?

152
00:10:49,864 --> 00:10:52,982
So you know, a bully is just a cowboy
with low self-esteem.

153
00:10:52,983 --> 00:10:55,021
- What was that, now?
- I said what?

154
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:58,476
My insecure ass is
gonna be wearing this shirt.

155
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:27,364
Mr. Maranjian?
Time for your MRI.

156
00:11:27,768 --> 00:11:30,383
- Could you remove his restraints, please?
- What?

157
00:11:30,384 --> 00:11:33,134
There's no metal allowed
in the MRI chamber.

158
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:35,835
I'll cut him loose
when we get to the door.

159
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:37,627
Relax Bob.

160
00:11:37,815 --> 00:11:41,705
You're only taking off my chains
so they can stuff me in a tin can.

161
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:45,201
You're not claustrophobic,
are you, Mr. Maranjian?

162
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:49,363
Because you've got nothing
to be afraid of.

163
00:11:57,102 --> 00:11:59,693
- Lets go over the code.
- What code? We're a couple of cops.

164
00:11:59,694 --> 00:12:01,954
Unarmed cops who may need
to communicate in code.

165
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,156
So look, I'll casually
mention "Star Trek".

166
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:06,334
- Great. 'cause that comes up a lot.
- It does.

167
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:09,254
Look, i- if I mention "Star Trek"
one, three, or five--

168
00:12:09,255 --> 00:12:12,007
Then everything's okay
because the odd ones suck.

169
00:12:12,008 --> 00:12:14,461
But if I mention two, four, or six,
then we're in trouble.

170
00:12:14,462 --> 00:12:17,862
So, say I mention "The Search for Spock",
what do you do?

171
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,628
I don't have a TV.

172
00:12:22,881 --> 00:12:25,642
Everybody has TVs.
Dead people have TVs.

173
00:12:25,942 --> 00:12:27,170
Damn it.

174
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:31,231
You're back again, Mr. Trent.

175
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:38,574
You know these kids with their skateboards.
It seems like he's getting hurt a lot lately.

176
00:12:43,507 --> 00:12:44,990
Mr. Maranjian...

177
00:12:45,423 --> 00:12:47,686
lets see if we can't get you
out of here in a jiff.

178
00:12:47,687 --> 00:12:50,127
Take your time.
I'm in no hurry.

179
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,268
Pull up your sleeve, please.

180
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:55,559
- Let me see your wrist.
- Thank you.

181
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,260
Ooh.

182
00:12:57,588 --> 00:13:01,336
Oh, that must be very itchy.
When did you get that rash?

183
00:13:01,703 --> 00:13:03,603
I never noticed that before.

184
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:06,421
Oh. Really?

185
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:10,683
Huh-- nurse, we're gonna have
to do some tests before the MRI.

186
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:13,377
If you could bring Mr. Maranjian
to the eighth floor, please.

187
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:14,347
Eight?

188
00:13:15,474 --> 00:13:16,760
Are you sure?

189
00:13:17,267 --> 00:13:19,398
Did I not make myself clear?

190
00:13:20,224 --> 00:13:22,864
- Uh, is something wrong?
- No, no, no. Not at all.

191
00:13:22,865 --> 00:13:25,982
It's just-- It's routine.
We'll have you back down here in a jiff.

192
00:13:25,983 --> 00:13:30,148
Nurse, if you could take him out
the side door, that would be great.

193
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:34,363
All what we got to do is keep
these marshals out of the MRI room.

194
00:13:34,364 --> 00:13:36,768
I don't know why you had to bring
stupid-ass doughnuts, man.

195
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:40,965
- You're not even ready.
- I am ready. I am 97.10% ready.

196
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:43,495
Hey, there.
Ted Crichton.

197
00:13:43,786 --> 00:13:45,711
- Bob Corville.
- Nice to meet you.

198
00:13:45,712 --> 00:13:48,059
- And, uh, Charlie Merrill.
- Charlie!

199
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,909
Well, I- I'm Greg Michaels.

200
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,655
It's just a little welcome
from the Belbridge P.D.

201
00:13:52,656 --> 00:13:53,756
Hey, appreciate it.

202
00:13:53,757 --> 00:13:55,924
Hopefully, we'll be out of your hair
pretty soon here.

203
00:13:55,925 --> 00:13:58,331
Oh, don't worry about it, man.
They get better medical than we do, huh?

204
00:13:58,332 --> 00:14:00,708
Whatever happened ********

205
00:14:04,091 --> 00:14:06,626
Oh. Buy me dinner first.

206
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:08,204
Marshals' orders.

207
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:16,814
Hi.

208
00:14:18,411 --> 00:14:19,810
I'm Bridget.

209
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:22,490
Eddie.
I'd shake your hand but...

210
00:14:23,053 --> 00:14:23,851
Wow!

211
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:28,114
- You a hardcase or something?
- I am going to prison.

212
00:14:28,115 --> 00:14:30,208
Really? Ooh.

213
00:14:30,631 --> 00:14:33,274
Can you pass along
a little message to my ex?

214
00:14:33,275 --> 00:14:36,279
Actually, it's some photos of me.

215
00:14:38,551 --> 00:14:41,590
Ah, this day just keeps
getting better.

216
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:47,349
How is this supposed to work?

217
00:14:47,537 --> 00:14:50,974
I barely dosed him with rohypnol.
It must have worn off by now.

218
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:52,627
Especially with the rash.

219
00:14:52,628 --> 00:14:55,454
Yeah, look at him.
He's-- he's totally fine.

220
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,114
This thing--
I need you to read on the...

221
00:14:58,115 --> 00:14:59,982
- P.A.?
- P.A. thing, yeah.

222
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:02,499
- You want me to make announcements?
- Yeah, could you, uh...

223
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,353
You're really, uh, are selling
the whole hospital experience.

224
00:15:05,354 --> 00:15:08,621
Mm, no. But that's not
what I'm selling.

225
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:12,523
I get up to use the jukebox...

226
00:15:12,524 --> 00:15:15,853
and this little skank goes
and parks herself on my bar stool.

227
00:15:15,854 --> 00:15:19,961
And I'm like, "No, no, no. I got dibs on that."
And you know what she does? Nothin'.

228
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,286
Like I'm not even there.

229
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:24,282
Dr. Burns, please report
to the cardiac ward.

230
00:15:24,283 --> 00:15:26,690
Dr. Burns to the cardiac ward.

231
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,732
Infectious disease unit,
please pick up line 23.

232
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:32,372
Infectious disease, pick up 23.

233
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:37,571
See, y- you tell someone
they have a bunch of symptoms...

234
00:15:37,702 --> 00:15:42,539
and the information gets processed
in the executive center of the brain, right?

235
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,579
It's job is to question assumptions,
start an argument.

236
00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:52,139
But if you suggest symptoms,
you can bypass all that.

237
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:57,059
- Like subliminal advertising?
- It's actually neurolinguistic programming...

238
00:15:57,338 --> 00:16:02,843
you know, the gateway to the amygdala,
which is the fear center of the brain.

239
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:06,682
You asked what we're selling.
That's-- That's what we're selling.

240
00:16:06,683 --> 00:16:08,879
- So we're selling...
- Fear.

241
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,817
- Oh. Fear.
- Yeah.

242
00:16:10,818 --> 00:16:12,394
- Cool.
- Yeah.

243
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,211
So, I eyeball the bartender, Casey,
and I'm like, "Hey, back me up here."

244
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:20,924
You know what he does?
Looks away. Yeah.

245
00:16:21,194 --> 00:16:25,668
And we used to go out. You know, not out out,
but, like, you know, hook up.

246
00:16:26,045 --> 00:16:28,392
So I figure,
I got to take care of this myself.

247
00:16:28,393 --> 00:16:31,407
We interrupt this broadcast
to bring you this special report.

248
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,888
Eddie? Eddie, hey, I'm talking here.

249
00:16:33,982 --> 00:16:36,433
Did you--
Did you see that?

250
00:16:36,434 --> 00:16:38,410
- What?
- It said "special report".

251
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:41,811
- It was there for a second, and then it was gone.
- Huh?

252
00:16:41,812 --> 00:16:43,412
"Special report", huh?

253
00:16:43,413 --> 00:16:46,852
Hey, maybe someone
took a pop at the pope.

254
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,228
It could happen.

255
00:16:54,335 --> 00:16:56,448
Are you with the center
for disease control?

256
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,504
This is an escaped contagion.

257
00:16:58,505 --> 00:17:02,163
This is a military jurisdiction order 23.

258
00:17:02,164 --> 00:17:04,529
All right, no one goes in or out.

259
00:17:12,754 --> 00:17:17,184
So, I go to the bar, right? And this blonde
who looks like my partner in a tube top...

260
00:17:17,185 --> 00:17:19,694
has a handful
of this brunette's hair, right?

261
00:17:19,695 --> 00:17:22,195
So, the brunette's screaming,
"Give me back my weave!"

262
00:17:22,196 --> 00:17:24,873
W- what is the blonde
supposed to do, sew it back in?

263
00:17:24,874 --> 00:17:27,173
I can't believe what
you guys have to do, man.

264
00:17:27,174 --> 00:17:28,487
You guys are nuts.

265
00:17:28,488 --> 00:17:31,353
Whoa, whoa. Excuse me. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We've got an inmate in here.

266
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:34,354
Three-car accident on the interstate.
He's gonna have to wait.

267
00:17:34,355 --> 00:17:35,724
Come on.

268
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,818
That's your inmate?

269
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,997
We've got a runaway.

270
00:17:50,124 --> 00:17:51,276
W- what...

271
00:17:56,499 --> 00:17:59,668
- How the hell did this happen?
- 14 years-- I have never lost a prisoner.

272
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:01,160
I'm not starting today.

273
00:18:01,161 --> 00:18:04,769
- Attention, all law-enforcement personnel.
- Hey, Bob. Bob, Bob, Bob.

274
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,278
Is that the best way to play this?

275
00:18:08,151 --> 00:18:09,101
I mean...

276
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,718
Come with me.

277
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:17,551
You were supposed to be watching that guy.
I mean we were supposed to be watching this guy.

278
00:18:17,552 --> 00:18:20,293
This is a career-ender, for all of us.

279
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:23,199
What are you suggesting?

280
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:26,096
All right, there's cameras
all over this hospital.

281
00:18:26,097 --> 00:18:30,397
Okay, I say we check the footage.
We go room by room until we find him.

282
00:18:30,628 --> 00:18:32,384
This never happened.

283
00:18:33,671 --> 00:18:37,342
- My wife just had a baby.
- His wife just had a baby.

284
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:38,507
Okay.

285
00:18:39,357 --> 00:18:41,836
But when I say we're done,
I'm calling it in.

286
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:43,537
- You got that?
- Okay.

287
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:44,991
- Let's go.
- Okay.

288
00:18:44,992 --> 00:18:48,190
- So much for having two hours.
- We're gonna stick with the original plan.

289
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:52,298
We're just gonna move things up.
Eliot, lose the uniform. Sophie, it's time.

290
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:56,091
I step away for, like, two minutes,
and you know what she does?

291
00:18:56,092 --> 00:18:58,739
She takes your barstool.
You told me already.

292
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,767
- Is it getting... hot in here?
- Shh!

293
00:19:01,851 --> 00:19:03,261
Anyone, nurse?!

294
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:05,572
I think I'm bleeding!

295
00:19:05,573 --> 00:19:06,737
I can't...

296
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,577
Ohh!

297
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:10,859
Ohh! Ohh!

298
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:12,521
I don't feel good!

299
00:19:12,806 --> 00:19:15,782
Aah!
I don't feel so good!

300
00:19:16,327 --> 00:19:18,336
- What is it, doc?
- Pulse is tachycardic.

301
00:19:18,337 --> 00:19:21,721
I need two units of packed RBC
and two of FFP I.V. Stat.

302
00:19:21,722 --> 00:19:24,584
Start a central line
and get a 12 lead, please.

303
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:26,729
- What's happening, doc?
- You're gonna be fine...

304
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,858
but I just need you to relax.

305
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:31,017
Prepare to intubate.

306
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,154
Ready to intubate.

307
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:38,672
- Doctor, she's bradying down!
- We're losing her.

308
00:19:38,982 --> 00:19:40,061
Clear!

309
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:44,735
- Again!
- Clear!

310
00:19:45,461 --> 00:19:48,105
We're losing her fast!
Come on! Come on!

311
00:19:48,106 --> 00:19:50,747
I'm gonna try one more thing.

312
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:57,301
All right, that's it.
That's it.

313
00:19:57,302 --> 00:19:58,552
I'm calling it.

314
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:01,275
Time-- 6:22 p.m.

315
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,474
Nurse, what's going on?

316
00:20:11,925 --> 00:20:12,920
Nurse!

317
00:20:13,436 --> 00:20:16,103
I'm-- what is going on?!

318
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:17,802
Nurse!

319
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:20,621
Hey, nurse!

320
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:23,120
Nurse!

321
00:20:24,032 --> 00:20:26,567
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

322
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:30,312
Wait. There.
Is-- is that him right there?

323
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:33,521
- Right there with the, uh... Yes, him.
- No... No.

324
00:20:33,522 --> 00:20:34,864
- You sure?
- Yeah.

325
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:37,267
- Really?
- What about here?

326
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:39,587
- No.
- It looks like him.

327
00:20:39,831 --> 00:20:42,279
- Are you sure, man?
- No!

328
00:20:43,882 --> 00:20:46,032
This is the last of the footage.

329
00:20:47,018 --> 00:20:49,272
Looks like Eddie's
still in the hospital.

330
00:20:49,273 --> 00:20:52,273
But why would he do that?
That doesn't make any sense.

331
00:20:52,274 --> 00:20:54,610
Well, if we think he's gone...

332
00:20:54,873 --> 00:20:57,389
then that moves the search outside.

333
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,080
It spreads us thin.

334
00:20:59,081 --> 00:21:03,031
He just waits for the right moment
and walks right out the front door.

335
00:21:03,032 --> 00:21:04,518
- You're right.
- Yeah.

336
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:06,963
Which means we'll have to account
for everybody in the building.

337
00:21:06,964 --> 00:21:07,714
Sure.

338
00:21:07,715 --> 00:21:09,315
- Greg, right?
- Yes.

339
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:12,508
- Where's your partner?
- Uh, he's answering a call from dispatch.

340
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:14,312
He's trying to buy us some time.

341
00:21:14,313 --> 00:21:18,530
Well, you tell Ted to get down here
because you and he are covering the north side.

342
00:21:18,531 --> 00:21:21,584
- You and I-- We got the south wing. Let's go.
- Sure thing. Yippity-skip.

343
00:21:21,585 --> 00:21:25,035
- Uh, me and Ted-- We'll meet you downstairs.
- All right.

344
00:21:27,374 --> 00:21:29,624
North wing with Charlie.
I got it.

345
00:21:29,677 --> 00:21:32,545
Tell me why I just pulled
two sets of car keys off these guys.

346
00:21:32,546 --> 00:21:36,362
- Why would they be riding separately?
- I'll gonna go check it out.

347
00:21:36,644 --> 00:21:38,766
Eliot. Eliot.

348
00:21:40,184 --> 00:21:41,106
Eliot.

349
00:21:41,107 --> 00:21:45,807
Yeah, well, we can't keep disappearing
on these guys. Bob's barely hooked as it is.

350
00:21:48,004 --> 00:21:51,283
Yeah, I'm at the hospital.
The kid's a klutz.

351
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:54,833
Hello?!
Is anyone there?!

352
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:57,270
Nurse! Nurse!

353
00:21:58,724 --> 00:22:02,085
Hello?!
Can anyone hear me?!

354
00:22:04,085 --> 00:22:05,090
Please!

355
00:22:05,184 --> 00:22:07,690
- What do we do now?
- Now? Now we wait.

356
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:11,402
This is the stall.
It's no different than any other con.

357
00:22:12,838 --> 00:22:14,444
Wait, his nose.

358
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
Is that...

359
00:22:15,955 --> 00:22:18,339
- real blood?
- I'm-- I'm bleeding!

360
00:22:18,724 --> 00:22:20,133
I'm bleeding!

361
00:22:20,312 --> 00:22:24,631
- Yes. Yes, it is.
- Hello?! Can anyone hear me?! Please!

362
00:22:24,715 --> 00:22:28,621
Did you just give a guy a nosebleed
with the power of your mind?

363
00:22:29,128 --> 00:22:31,523
Amygdala mania.

364
00:22:32,892 --> 00:22:34,959
Almond tonsils.

365
00:22:39,672 --> 00:22:43,918
Is it just me, or has Nate gotten
a little sadistic since he quit drinking?

366
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,211
Is it just me, or does that make him
even more attractive?

367
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:16,008
Eliot, can you talk?
What's Charlie doing?

368
00:23:16,093 --> 00:23:18,112
I haven't gotten there yet.

369
00:23:18,113 --> 00:23:21,283
No wonder I couldn't hear you on my coms.
Eliot, stop checking out the nurses...

370
00:23:21,284 --> 00:23:22,889
and get your ass down to Charlie!

371
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,868
I'm on my way, all right?
Shut up.

372
00:23:36,163 --> 00:23:39,628
Excuse me, sir. Can I talk to you
for a second, please?

373
00:23:41,332 --> 00:23:42,711
Wait here.

374
00:23:55,786 --> 00:23:58,002
What seems to be the problem?

375
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,904
How did your son break his arm?

376
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:04,014
He fell off his skateboard.

377
00:24:04,015 --> 00:24:06,693
- He fell off his skateboard.
- Yeah.

378
00:24:09,578 --> 00:24:11,738
That bruise on his cheek's a week old.

379
00:24:11,739 --> 00:24:15,133
The one on his neck is three days.
He get that falling, too?

380
00:24:15,134 --> 00:24:17,740
- You don't believe me? Ask him.
- Why, huh?

381
00:24:17,741 --> 00:24:19,908
So I can hear how well his daddy
taught him to lie?

382
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:23,596
If you're gonna arrest me, go ahead.
I'll be out in five minutes.

383
00:24:23,597 --> 00:24:25,531
I ain't gonna arrest you.

384
00:24:37,051 --> 00:24:40,036
Randall Trent, 73 Austin Street.

385
00:24:42,318 --> 00:24:44,365
I got my eye on you now.

386
00:24:48,318 --> 00:24:50,868
How many guys
don't even see their kids?

387
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:53,775
I bet this place is full
of deadbeat dads.

388
00:24:54,339 --> 00:24:58,018
But a man who provides for his family,
who shows his son a firm hand...

389
00:24:58,019 --> 00:24:59,804
he's the bad guy?

390
00:25:00,686 --> 00:25:02,930
Go back to your speed traps.

391
00:25:13,823 --> 00:25:15,016
Hello?

392
00:25:18,386 --> 00:25:21,204
- Who the hell is that?
- That is hospital security.

393
00:25:21,205 --> 00:25:24,029
We didn't have a chance
to break down their schedule.

394
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:28,124
Okay, looks like someone's
crashing our party. Sophie, you're up.

395
00:25:29,786 --> 00:25:32,585
You know, I once had to play
six parts in "Nicholas Nickleby"...

396
00:25:32,586 --> 00:25:36,011
and Mrs. Squeers and Phib
had a bloody song together.

397
00:25:38,171 --> 00:25:40,996
- Is anybody up here?
- I'm down here!

398
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,574
Please!

399
00:25:43,801 --> 00:25:44,740
Hello?

400
00:25:46,204 --> 00:25:47,246
Hello?

401
00:26:09,352 --> 00:26:12,670
You have been exposed to an antigen
that is repelled by water.

402
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:15,505
Do not move until you hear
further instructions.

403
00:26:15,506 --> 00:26:17,911
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

404
00:26:43,655 --> 00:26:45,205
Why is this a rental?

405
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:49,082
Hi, I'm calling from the
Patrolman's Benevolent Association.

406
00:26:49,176 --> 00:26:54,376
Yeah, I'm trying to get in touch with two of
your officers-- Greg Michaels and Ted Crichton.

407
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:58,029
Yeah.
You don't?

408
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:02,068
Our files must be out of date.
Thank you.

409
00:27:06,824 --> 00:27:07,848
Eliot...

410
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:11,506
You remember when Eddie got a slap on the wrist
because the judge said he provided...

411
00:27:11,507 --> 00:27:13,468
"substantial assistance"
to the government?

412
00:27:13,469 --> 00:27:16,494
Yeah, well, it looks like Eddie
ratted out the Armenian mob.

413
00:27:16,495 --> 00:27:20,551
And Marshal Charlie-- He ain't a fed.
He's a hit man sent to kill Eddie...

414
00:27:20,552 --> 00:27:24,962
unless duct tape and lye are
standard issue for a Deputy U.S. Marshal.

415
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:27,113
E- Eliot. You--

416
00:27:29,244 --> 00:27:32,249
Eliot, are you there?
Can you hear me?

417
00:27:35,271 --> 00:27:36,839
Charlie, hi.

418
00:27:37,224 --> 00:27:38,624
- Any luck?
- No.

419
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:41,593
He could be anywhere.
Check the drawers.

420
00:27:48,895 --> 00:27:51,750
This job never gets
any easier, does it?

421
00:27:52,774 --> 00:27:54,755
No, it does not.

422
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:06,517
Would Dr. Ralph O. Khan
please report to surgery?

423
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,653
Dr. Ralph O. Khan,
report to surgery.

424
00:28:10,097 --> 00:28:11,586
Ralph O. Khan!

425
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,947
You picked the wrong day
to mess with me, Charlie.

426
00:28:42,171 --> 00:28:43,351
Come on.

427
00:29:09,393 --> 00:29:10,338
Punk.

428
00:29:11,412 --> 00:29:14,788
Please!
I-- please, help me!

429
00:29:16,943 --> 00:29:18,896
Please, somebody help me.

430
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,908
Somebody, help me.

431
00:29:25,571 --> 00:29:27,551
Mr. Maranjian,
we need you to settle down.

432
00:29:27,552 --> 00:29:28,740
Settle down?

433
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:32,363
What the hell is going on here?
That woman next to me-- She came in here.

434
00:29:32,364 --> 00:29:36,672
- She was fine, and now she's dead!
- She was not fine.

435
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,560
What was wrong with her?

436
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,863
- What was wrong with her?!
- We're trying to find out.

437
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:45,187
You see, the soviets had a program.

438
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,586
They were trying to weaponize
the Marburg Virus.

439
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:51,309
It's all very, very, very secret.

440
00:29:51,988 --> 00:29:55,886
And we're finding that the accelerated
incubation period of the dozen cases...

441
00:29:55,887 --> 00:29:58,166
- that we've--
- Dozen cases?!

442
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:00,577
Yes,
That we've studied...

443
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:02,202
are all...

444
00:30:02,606 --> 00:30:05,320
it's, um--
Well, we've...

445
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,208
Oh, God.

446
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:10,947
- Oh, God!
- Dr. Foster!

447
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:13,756
- Oh, God!
- Dr. Foster!

448
00:30:14,935 --> 00:30:18,111
Oh, Go-o-d!

449
00:30:30,047 --> 00:30:32,908
You think you can just ignore me,
like I don't have any feelings...

450
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:35,631
like I never sat there,
never listened to you talk all night.

451
00:30:35,632 --> 00:30:37,852
Hardison, have you been talking
the whole time?

452
00:30:37,853 --> 00:30:40,881
I wouldn't have had to if you
didn't turn off your daggum com!

453
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:44,305
I took care of the fake marshal.
Where's the real one?

454
00:30:46,728 --> 00:30:51,397
Eliot, it, uh, looks like
he's in the stairwell on his way to...

455
00:30:51,735 --> 00:30:53,087
Oh, no.

456
00:30:54,721 --> 00:30:56,177
That ain't good, man.

457
00:30:56,178 --> 00:30:58,303
I'm fine. You know, the rash...

458
00:30:58,444 --> 00:31:00,244
- is localized.
- I know.

459
00:31:00,245 --> 00:31:03,133
I just need an anti-inflammatory, nurse.
And give me--

460
00:31:03,134 --> 00:31:06,273
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry. Order 23.

461
00:31:06,274 --> 00:31:08,780
Wait. Where are you going?!
You can't just leave me here!

462
00:31:08,781 --> 00:31:12,472
Please, nurse, let me--
Let me talk to CDC in Atlanta.

463
00:31:12,482 --> 00:31:14,925
- I can't. They're coming.
- Who's coming?!

464
00:31:14,926 --> 00:31:17,348
Wait, what's order 23?!

465
00:31:17,451 --> 00:31:19,687
Is it to leave us here to die?

466
00:31:20,054 --> 00:31:22,595
Please, get me out of here.

467
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:25,338
- I am not sick!
- Don't listen to him.

468
00:31:25,339 --> 00:31:28,200
Variant "U" cannot be released
into the general population!

469
00:31:28,201 --> 00:31:29,367
Shut up!!

470
00:31:29,508 --> 00:31:33,161
- It's not my decision!
- Is it for $400,000?

471
00:31:34,054 --> 00:31:36,686
Is it your decision then?
I have it.

472
00:31:36,911 --> 00:31:41,904
Near here, and I'll take you there.
All you have to do is let me go, please.

473
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:45,412
No! No!

474
00:31:46,745 --> 00:31:50,291
No! No! No! No! No!

475
00:31:50,657 --> 00:31:54,285
You're making a big mistake!
Everyone's gonna die!

476
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:27,615
Oh, damn!

477
00:32:28,845 --> 00:32:31,304
Attention,
all law-enforcement personnel.

478
00:32:31,305 --> 00:32:34,099
Code 10-98.
I repeat, code 10-98.

479
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,569
Escaped prisoner
leaving county general...

480
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:38,968
possibly armed and dangerous.

481
00:32:42,343 --> 00:32:43,770
"Ralph O. Khan"?

482
00:32:43,855 --> 00:32:48,619
Man, you see what ideas you come up with
when you got no blood flow to your brain.

483
00:32:55,165 --> 00:32:56,967
Oh, man. Come on.

484
00:33:12,266 --> 00:33:13,393
Hey.

485
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:16,350
How's the arm, my man?

486
00:33:17,448 --> 00:33:19,599
- It's okay.
- Yeah?

487
00:33:19,684 --> 00:33:22,388
My name's Eliot.
What's your name?

488
00:33:24,989 --> 00:33:25,919
Randy.

489
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:29,377
Randy.
Oh, I like that name.

490
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,750
I got an uncle named Randy.

491
00:33:34,635 --> 00:33:37,743
There sure are a lot of cops
around here, huh?

492
00:33:38,729 --> 00:33:42,299
You know, if you wanted,
you could go up to one...

493
00:33:43,707 --> 00:33:46,421
and tell them
what happened to your arm.

494
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:51,777
Hey, Randy.

495
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,945
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

496
00:33:58,509 --> 00:34:03,011
Dad knows these cops, you know?
They come to my house.

497
00:34:03,439 --> 00:34:05,814
They'll drink beer.
I mean...

498
00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:14,089
I can't.

499
00:34:16,703 --> 00:34:17,647
Eliot.

500
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:20,165
Come on, man.
We got to go.

501
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,010
Nice meeting you, man.

502
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:43,463
Parker, we're blown.
Cops are everywhere.

503
00:34:54,377 --> 00:34:57,148
They've got the hospital on lockdown.

504
00:34:57,909 --> 00:35:00,651
We're gonna have to hug the wall
and wait for the camera to pass, okay?

505
00:35:00,652 --> 00:35:02,862
The exit's right over there.

506
00:35:07,853 --> 00:35:09,430
Thanks. I see it.

507
00:36:37,617 --> 00:36:38,917
A deal's a deal.

508
00:36:39,016 --> 00:36:42,153
So, what happened, Eddie, huh?

509
00:36:42,236 --> 00:36:45,514
You got a little bored during your trial,
you started looking around, and you thought...

510
00:36:45,515 --> 00:36:50,171
"What's the last place someone would look
for stolen money in this town?"

511
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:55,856
What's so funny, Eddie?

512
00:36:56,363 --> 00:36:59,863
I'm just thinking about all
the crimes you committed today.

513
00:36:59,988 --> 00:37:02,753
Burglary, assault, kidnapping.

514
00:37:03,101 --> 00:37:06,678
I'm going to prison for 18 months.
But you-- every one of you...

515
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:09,392
is looking at 25 to life!

516
00:37:10,064 --> 00:37:15,526
I know your faces. I know all your faces.
I am really good with faces.

517
00:37:15,658 --> 00:37:18,228
You're gonna pay
for what you did to me.

518
00:37:18,312 --> 00:37:19,805
Right now!

519
00:37:25,051 --> 00:37:26,647
Stop! Hey!

520
00:37:26,741 --> 00:37:28,899
Stop! Stop! Stop! Please!
They're in there!

521
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,159
- Get on the ground! Get on the ground!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

522
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,618
They're in there. They told me I was gonna die.
I was in the hospital. They locked me in a room.

523
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,397
- It's not was you think!
- Get on the ground now!

524
00:37:37,398 --> 00:37:40,213
Okay. Okay, but listen.
I didn't do anything wrong.

525
00:37:40,214 --> 00:37:42,926
I'm the victim here!
They're in there!

526
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,169
Sir, you assaulted a security guard!
You tasered a nurse!

527
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,453
- You escaped federal custody!
- No!

528
00:37:48,454 --> 00:37:50,680
- No, I didn't! No!
- Get on the ground right now!

529
00:37:50,681 --> 00:37:53,507
- On the ground now!
- I'm not trying to escape!

530
00:37:53,508 --> 00:37:56,439
I'm running for my life!
You're not listening!

531
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,506
Please, listen.
I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't--

532
00:37:59,797 --> 00:38:02,353
You don't get it.
You don't-- please, listen.

533
00:38:02,354 --> 00:38:04,954
- Let me explain! Look--
- Yeah, that's the guy.

534
00:38:04,955 --> 00:38:09,905
Can you listen-- Can you listen to me, please?
They're in there. They're gonna get away.

535
00:38:12,115 --> 00:38:14,365
Yeah. Yeah, that's the guy.

536
00:38:14,694 --> 00:38:17,309
That's the guy
that did this to me.

537
00:38:30,524 --> 00:38:34,185
That's what they want you to think!
That's what they want you to think!

538
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:36,549
None of it's true!
I'm telling the truth!

539
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,929
I'm t-- wait.

540
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:40,430
Look, please, if you'd just listen.

541
00:38:40,894 --> 00:38:44,641
Listen! Please, listen!
None of you are listening to me!

542
00:38:44,727 --> 00:38:46,721
None-- none of it--

543
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,807
That's them! Do you see them?!
That one was trying to be a doctor!

544
00:38:49,808 --> 00:38:53,240
And t- that one's a nurse!
That one's a nurse!

545
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,641
So, here's everything you need
to know about criminal law.

546
00:38:56,642 --> 00:39:00,142
Every crime has two elements--
Actus reus, the act itself--

547
00:39:00,177 --> 00:39:02,617
And mens rea--
Literally "The Guilty Mind."

548
00:39:02,618 --> 00:39:05,440
- Wait. Now you're a doctor and a lawyer?
- Yes.

549
00:39:05,441 --> 00:39:09,465
Now, for escape, the prisoner
has to both break out of custody...

550
00:39:09,616 --> 00:39:11,616
and show the intent to escape.

551
00:39:11,617 --> 00:39:16,613
Wait, so if, let's say, a prisoner was taken
hostage during a jailbreak...

552
00:39:16,716 --> 00:39:19,066
then he wouldn't be guilty of escape.

553
00:39:19,488 --> 00:39:21,732
- That's a perfect example.
- Kiss ass.

554
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:24,418
Which brings us back
to our friend Eddie...

555
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:27,280
and how the brain reacts to fear.
In the heat of the moment...

556
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,684
Eddie didn't ask himself
a simple question--

557
00:39:29,685 --> 00:39:32,470
Who would doubt his guilty mind?

558
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:39,256
I hate the morgue.

559
00:39:39,641 --> 00:39:42,021
These things all look the same
to me, you know?

560
00:39:42,022 --> 00:39:45,495
We're looking for an A-17.
Alpha-1-7.

561
00:39:45,496 --> 00:39:46,960
Oh. Yeah.

562
00:39:47,345 --> 00:39:50,702
Oh, sweet news, guys. A couple of units
picked up our guy up downtown.

563
00:39:50,703 --> 00:39:52,762
He had a mental breakdown
or something...

564
00:39:52,763 --> 00:39:56,740
complain about the plague
or locusts or, like, hemorrhoids or...

565
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,637
Well...

566
00:39:58,721 --> 00:40:00,421
There it is right there.

567
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:03,452
- A-17.
- Wow, that's great.

568
00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:06,322
- Oh!
- Oh.

569
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,008
- Look.
- Oh!

570
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:15,266
Whoa!

571
00:40:15,717 --> 00:40:17,782
He lunged at me.
You saw that, right?

572
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:20,158
He lunged at me.
I'm writing this in my report.

573
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:23,459
He's supposed to be dead.
What the hell? What the hell?

574
00:40:25,348 --> 00:40:26,662
That guy.

575
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,024
Oh, God.

576
00:40:28,516 --> 00:40:29,915
What's wrong, Bob?

577
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,660
It's been a hell of a day, Ted.

578
00:40:32,661 --> 00:40:35,512
I got duped by a fake marshal...

579
00:40:36,014 --> 00:40:38,239
and let my first prisoner escape.

580
00:40:38,371 --> 00:40:40,322
That's not the way I see it.

581
00:40:40,407 --> 00:40:42,071
What do you mean?

582
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:45,960
"A courageous U.S. Marshal
put himself in harm's way...

583
00:40:45,961 --> 00:40:48,586
"by allowing a contract killer
to infiltrate his team...

584
00:40:48,587 --> 00:40:52,737
in an effort to derail a plot to murder
a cooperating federal witness."

585
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:55,457
That's my report.
This is your collar.

586
00:40:55,832 --> 00:40:57,917
That's good,
but I can't let you do that.

587
00:40:57,918 --> 00:41:00,822
I'm the one that told you not to make the call.
You said, "I'm gonna call it in."

588
00:41:00,823 --> 00:41:03,896
I said, "No, no, no, don't."
So, it's only fair.

589
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,688
Damn right it is.

590
00:41:06,092 --> 00:41:10,802
You and your partner-- You're all right.
I don't know how to thank you, though.

591
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:22,871
Do one thing for me.

592
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:24,841
You got it.

593
00:41:29,311 --> 00:41:30,231
Randy?

594
00:41:31,621 --> 00:41:34,288
I'm Deputy United States Marshal
Robert Corville.

595
00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:35,589
I'm from Boston.

596
00:41:36,072 --> 00:41:38,374
I think you and I need to talk.

597
00:41:38,646 --> 00:41:40,995
Who are you talking to out there?

598
00:41:44,285 --> 00:41:45,449
Come on.

599
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:49,816
It's all right, son.
Come on.

600
00:41:51,107 --> 00:41:53,498
You're gonna be okay, Randy.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
