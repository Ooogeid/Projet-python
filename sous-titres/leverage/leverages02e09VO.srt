4
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,300
- Mr. Kimball?
- Huh?

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,200
It's Ruth.

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,700
Ruth Walton.

7
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,600
Gigi?

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,600
- No. Ruth.
- Huh?

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,600
I'm the charity director.

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,700
These are the children
you helped.

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,400
You wanted to see them,
remember?

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,100
I've been trying to see you for months,
but your lawyer has cut you off from everyone.

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,300
What are you doing here?

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,600
Mr. Kimball,
listen to me.

15
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,800
Don't let him do this.
You have to fight.

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,400
Get out -- now.

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,000
- This is a public hospital.
- And this is a private wing,

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,700
named after this man, in fact.

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,400
- You're trespassing.
- Oh, call a cop.

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,200
Okay. Police.

21
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,100
Let's go.

22
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,600
Mr. Kimball, this man --
he's trying to take your money.

23
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,300
Gigi. Oh, Gigi.

24
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,200
No, it's Ruth.
I'm your friend!

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,700
Gigi!

26
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,700
- Who's dead?
- No, no. Everybody's okay.

27
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,200
- Can I...
- huh?

28
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,500
I-I...

29
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,900
Oh. Y-You scared
the life out of me.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,300
Listen, you can't just show up
here without any --

31
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,000
You've got to come back.

32
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,700
Um...

33
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,100
I thought you were all
doing fine without me.

34
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,600
Oh, yeah.
No, we're doing fine.

35
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,000
I mean, yeah.
Everything's --

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,800
i mean, it kind of went from a quintet
to what we are now -- a quartet.

37
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,800
I mean, it's like,
we still know how to play.

38
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,000
W-we sound good, you know.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,900
But something is, uh,
sounding a little bit, uh...

40
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,800
you know, wrong.

41
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,900
Huh.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,100
Well, I hope that I'm --

43
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,800
I really hope I'm not the violist
because when I was little,

44
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,400
my mum made me have lessons,
and I was rubbish.

45
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,000
I was completely rubbish.
I can't play a note.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,900
- Not a single note.
- Please come back.

47
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
We need you.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
They need me?

49
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,600
Or you need me?

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,700
I, uh...

51
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,300
I'm meeting a new client
tomorrow at 10:00 AM.

52
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,500
You'll be there, right?

53
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,000
- Nathan Ford?
- What?

54
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,700
- Are you Nathan Ford?
- Yes.

55
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,700
I'm Tara Carlisle.
I'm Ruth Walton's attorney.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,400
She's running late. I'm sure you know
that Bennett Kimball passed away last week.

57
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,300
I'm sorry. Ruth didn't
mention an attorney.

58
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,800
W-why are you here?

59
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,400
Oh, that's Ruth. We can talk
about this later.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,300
Hi. You must be Nate.

61
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,700
Hello.

62
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,500
I just heard about Mr. Kimball,
and I'm sorry.

63
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,100
Blue irises.

64
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,800
They were his favorite.

65
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,600
Uh, so, why don't we sit down?

66
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,800
Uh...

67
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,700
so, how did you meet him?

68
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,100
I run a nonprofit.

69
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,100
We move children
from foster care into adoption.

70
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,800
One day, I got a call
from Mr. Kimball.

71
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,700
He said he'd read about us
in the newspaper and wanted to help.

72
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,300
I figured he'd make a donation,
and that would be that.

73
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,400
His checks kept coming,
each one bigger than the last.

74
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah. That's not so unusual.

75
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,100
You know, men like Kimball-- end of their lives,
you know, they're looking for redemption.

76
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,500
Are you gonna just
write down what I say? Is that the deal?

77
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,500
Yes. Ruth, go on.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,700
Well, when his health started to fail,

79
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,400
I would visit him,
show him pictures of our kids.

80
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,700
It would really cheer him up.

81
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,200
And that's when he told her
about his will.

82
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,300
Yeah, yeah.
She's actually doing fine.

83
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,000
- You don't really need to...
- I'm sorry.

84
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,100
Sorry.

85
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,500
A few months ago, Mr. Kimball told me
he had drafted a new will,

86
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,600
leaving his entire estate
to my charity. I was stunned.

87
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,500
Yeah. Did he ever show you
this new will?

88
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,500
No, after that, his lawyer, Peter Blanchard,
wouldn't let anyone see him.

89
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,900
I knew he was doing badly, so...

90
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Last week
I snuck into his room.

91
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,900
He didn't even know who I was.

92
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,500
He kept calling me Gigi.

93
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,500
It's all right.
It's okay.

94
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,500
Well, Ruth, here--here's the thing.
I mean, will or no will,

95
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,200
we're gonna make sure that
Mr. Kimball's wishes are followed.

96
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,500
Yes. The law will see to that.

97
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,700
Thank you.

98
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
I'm gonna
bring these to him.

99
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,000
So, I guess we're gonna have
that talk now.

100
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,500
I checked you out,
Mr. Ford.

101
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,300
Half my sources say
you're a vicious thief.

102
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,900
The other half claim
you're some sort of high-tech vigilante.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,500
I like that.
I should put that on my card.

104
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,700
There's a process
to get Ruth Walton justice.

105
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,600
- It's called the probate court.
- Right.

106
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:05,000
The probate court, where Ruth will walk in
with a sad story and no executed will.

107
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,800
Yeah, let me know
how that goes for you.

108
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,000
Okay.
I know we're in trouble.

109
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,200
But the only reason
I let Ruth come to you

110
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,800
is on the condition that I know
everything you're doing.

111
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,200
- No.
- You're taking me with you.

112
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,700
Wherever you go,
whatever you do, I'm there.

113
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,000
Not gonna happen.

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,400
I don't just have a responsibility
to Ruth as my client.

115
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,400
I believe
in what she's doing.

116
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,800
And for that reason, I am willing to put
my feelings about you aside and work with you.

117
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,000
Now, if helping Ruth
is really your only agenda,

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,300
shouldn't you be willing
to do the same?

119
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,500
Either I am in,
or Ruth is out.

120
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,000
It's your choice.

121
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,700
They are gonna hate this.

122
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,900
I hate this.

123
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,200
You do not let Vicki Vale
into the Batcave ever.

124
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,800
First, this is my home,
not a cave.

125
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,500
And, second, we're not gonna
allow her up here.

126
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,700
Sophie would never approve.
Call her.

127
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,300
We can't just
keep calling Sophie.

128
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,600
Oh, okay.
I see how it is.

129
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,100
We can't call her, but you can go off
and have a little secret meeting with her.

130
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,500
Secret meeting?
What are you talking about?

131
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,300
I was in Harrisburg,
researching a client.

132
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,200
Wow,
'cause you know what?

133
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,700
Your passport got dinged going through
Heathrow Airport yesterday.

134
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,400
Heathrow's in London.

135
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,300
I guess you couldn't get
a direct flight over to Harrisburg.

136
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,200
Well, it's hard when you do
the same-day booking.

137
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,400
Yeah, 'cause you had to go
with the --

138
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:31,700
Did you realize that London is the home of
the most surveillance cameras in the world?

139
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,800
- Really?
- Who feels like playing "Where's Waldo"?

140
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,000
- Oh. Yeah.
- I do.

141
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,200
Oh. There's Waldo
right there.

142
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,500
Waldo Ford.

143
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,900
Oh, oh.

144
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,500
Is that Big Ben and you?

145
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Wow. You got twins
and triplets everywhere.

146
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,800
And looky there. 11:18 AM.

147
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,600
Standing outside
of Sophie's apartment,

148
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,100
looking quite pensive.

149
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Aww. He's rehearsing
what he's gonna say.

150
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,300
I've seen him do that.

151
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,700
All right, all right,
all right, guys. Okay.

152
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,600
Yeah. You caught me.

153
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,800
I went to London. Yeah.

154
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,000
I saw Sophie.

155
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,400
And she's not coming back.

156
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,600
Not now or not ever?

157
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,900
I don't know.

158
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,200
And I don't--
I don't think she knows either.

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,800
So, uh... that's that.

160
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,800
Could you please take the...

161
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,300
Thank you.
Can we get back to work?

162
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,500
This, uh...

163
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,400
Tara Carlisle --

164
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,300
Hardison, maybe you can just do
a background check on her.

165
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,500
And if everything pans out,
I don't see why we can't have an outsider,

166
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,200
just this once,
tag along. Hmm?

167
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Okay. Why don't
you run it for them?

168
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,400
Meet the late,
great Bennett Kimball.

169
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,000
He made his fortune
the old-fashioned way --

170
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,400
polluting, union busting,
employing sweatshop labor.

171
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,300
His personal life
was even worse.

172
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,600
Drunken-driving accidents,
chasing women, paying off the mob.

173
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,300
Then why haven't
we ever heard of the guy?

174
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,100
Because, to the rest of the world, Bennett Kimball
was a pillar of boston society...

175
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,900
thanks to one
very hardworking lawyer.

176
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,400
Meet his longtime attorney,
Peter Blanchard.

177
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,800
This is
an interesting guy.

178
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,600
He's a blue-blood Harvard law graduate
who turned into Kimball's personal janitor.

179
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,400
Dude would pay off the cops,
pay hush money, God knows what else.

180
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,100
And he was rewarded by being named the executor
and sole beneficiary of Kimball's estate.

181
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,300
See, Kimball didn't have any kids.
He had a couple ex-wives way, way back,

182
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,400
but Blanchard's the closest
thing he has to family.

183
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,400
Yeah, well, I guess this Blanchard guy
didn't count on his client having such a giving side.

184
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,100
It's funny how that works.

185
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,700
What happens to rich people
when they know the end is near.

186
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,300
It's really,
really amazing.

187
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,800
Okay, I don't know that we have
a legal angle to play on this one,

188
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,400
'cause, in three days,

189
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,700
he is going to present the will in probate court
and assume control of the estate.

190
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,700
And our client's charity
gets nothing.

191
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,800
Now, Blanchard was the keeper
of Kimball's secrets, so...

192
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,800
Yeah, so that's our way in,
right there.

193
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,400
You want a skeleton
from his closet.

194
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,100
Absolutely, and there's got
to be tons of skeletons.

195
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,700
I mean, we want something so scary that the mere
mention of it makes this guy run for his checkbook.

196
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,900
So, if that weren't hard enough,

197
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,200
we've got the chaperone
to think about.

198
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,900
Tara Carlisle.
She checks out.

199
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,000
Civil-rights lawyer,
does a lot of pro bono work.

200
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Collects lost causes
like kittens.

201
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,900
Well, she's honest.

202
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,000
Crusader.
Incorruptible.

203
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,000
And one sexy
librarian.

204
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,900
Guys, uh, I'd like you
to meet Tara Carlisle.

205
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,800
She's our client's attorney.
She's gonna be joining us today.

206
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,700
I'm here because I believe
we share a common goal.

207
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
I just want to make sure
it's done the right way.

208
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,300
Now, you said you had something
we could use against Blanchard?

209
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,200
Okay, well,
behind these prison walls --

210
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,200
or, um,
prison shrubs here

211
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,600
is Kimball's former
business partner, PJ Orson.

212
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,200
He's doing 10 years
for embezzlement.

213
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,300
Kimball's company paid $50,000 to a company
called Lamond Holdings back in 1980.

214
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,800
That? Yeah. She does that.
It's okay. Go ahead.

215
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,500
Lamond Holdings is a Vegas
front company for the mob.

216
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Yeah, $50,000 used to be the going rate
for a contract killer in those days.

217
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,700
You think Kimball paid
to have somebody killed?

218
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Okay, now what we're gonna do right now
is we are going to go undercover.

219
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,500
- And --
- Why don't we go talk to Mr. Orson?

220
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,300
No, the best lie is the truth, Mr. Ford.

221
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,000
I think if we go in there, and plead our case,
Mr. Orson will want to talk to us.

222
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,500
Mr. Orson,
I don't understand.

223
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,200
If you tell me why you made
that $50,000 payment to Lamond Holdings,

224
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,200
I could write a letter to the judge,
possibly get your sentence reduced.

225
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Reduced? This is minimum security.
I love it here.

226
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,700
No ex-wives hounding me for alimony.

227
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
A great bunch of guys to hang with.

228
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,300
I mean,
why would I help you?

229
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,500
Listen, sweetie, I got to go.
I got a cooking class.

230
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,500
You have a great day.

231
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,200
Well... I guess that went pretty well.

232
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,300
Okay, Hardison, Eliot, I want you to
put the squeeze on Orson.

233
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,300
Parker,
case Blanchard's office.

234
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,300
I want to know where he keeps
his dirty files.

235
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,300
You, why don't you come
with me?

236
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,200
I'm about to become
a really terrible lawyer.

237
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,900
You can watch.

238
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,800
I think he is.

239
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,100
Look, Blanchard's here at the same time you are.
That's a coincidence.

240
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,700
No, no, we hacked into his
online appointment schedule.

241
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,700
I mean,
yes, what a coincidence.

242
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,200
Why don't you wait for me
outside?

243
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,900
What are you gonna do?

244
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,700
Make an appointment with --
You'll see.

245
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,400
Um...

246
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,600
hmm.

247
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,100
Yes.

248
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,400
Hi, there. Listen. Jimmy Popodokolos,
Las Vegas. Attorney-at-law.

249
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,400
I'm here to talk to the judge
about the Kimball probate hearing.

250
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,400
- Okay, Mr. Popodokolos.
- Okay. Thank you. Yeah.

251
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,700
- Very important. Thank you.
- Sure.

252
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,500
After batting in the big leagues,
this will probably be like T-Ball for us anyway.

253
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,800
How does it work here?

254
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,000
Uh, well, if an inmate
gets three disciplinary marks,

255
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,200
he gets shipped to
maximum-security prison in salem --

256
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
- No, no, no, no, no. No.
- No excuses.

257
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,000
He said maximum security.

258
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:51,800
- I got bad, bad. I remember things, man.
- It's okay, Roger.

259
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,300
This man survived the riot of cellblock "H," man.
How are you gonna bring that up?

260
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,300
Oh. No, no, no.
Look, look.

261
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,400
Nothing like that
ever happens here.

262
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,900
I mean, half these guys
are CEOs.

263
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,300
- CEOs.
- Ah. For example, Mr. Orson here.

264
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,200
He's been a model prisoner
for the last five years.

265
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,300
- Nice haircut, Frank.
- Oh, thanks.

266
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,100
Uh... yeah.

267
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,200
I want you to meet
officers bagley and hilts.

268
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,100
Hilts.
This is bagley.

269
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,300
They just transferred here
from salem.

270
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,800
Wow, can't remember the last guards
that came here from salem.

271
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,800
- Hey, Frank.
- Well, uh...

272
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,300
Don't do that.

273
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,000
They made the transfer on account of
what happened to me during the riots, man.

274
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,000
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

275
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,300
There was a riot?
I didn't hear about it.

276
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
I'm not even supposed to talk
about it. I'm sorry.

277
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,900
But the BOP is trying to keep it hush-hush
'cause they didn't even keep the riots down.

278
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,200
They just let the gangs take over.
They was all up in there, man.

279
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,100
Do you know
who the Mexican cartel is?

280
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,100
They was all up in there
with the Aryan nation and the fruits of Islam.

281
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,400
Everybody was up in there.
Colors -- purple, red.

282
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,700
And then they was
just hitting people.

283
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,700
- It's not your fault.
- This is not your fault. All right.

284
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,400
- You can't be that close to the prisoner.
- No. No. No.

285
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,000
- You know that?
- It's can be, but he's in my personal space.

286
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,600
Too bad you're not
working on Sundays.

287
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,200
You're gonna miss
the omelet bar.

288
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,200
- Omelet bar.
- Pardon me, Roger.

289
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,900
- Is this guy giving you any trouble?
- No. Why?

290
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,100
Well, because I just got
the report of an inmate

291
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:51,300
that matches his description
that may be carrying a weapon.

292
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,200
Can you stand for me, sir?

293
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,300
- No.
- Only thing I'm carrying is his queen.

294
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,900
- I... you got me, PJ.
- Yeah.

295
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,600
- Officer.
- Oh.

296
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,000
Sorry, PJ. You know,
it's regulations here.

297
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,600
Whoo!

298
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,800
- What is it?
- Roger. Roger.

299
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,100
It's a shiv. It's a shiv.

300
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,100
- That's a shiv.
- This is outrageous. Why would I do that?

301
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,400
'Cause you're Aryan nation. You said
you coming to get me. I knew you looked --

302
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,400
He said you was gonna cut my head off
and put it in a little bucket.

303
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,900
Great job screening
your inmates here.

304
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,900
When's the last time someone's
checked this man's cell?

305
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,100
Uh, cell.
You mean his bunk?

306
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,100
Bunk?

307
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,300
- Frank, Frank. You know that.
- Bunk.

308
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,000
That's not mine.
You know that.

309
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,800
- Clear!
- Frank, tell them. Frank.

310
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,900
That man was gonna shank me
over an omelet.

311
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,900
Two eggs and a slice
of government cheese.

312
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,500
Is that what my life
is worth?

313
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,800
You better go
and get away from me.

314
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,900
- Move, move.
- Yeah, yeah. Sure.

315
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,100
My God,
he is Aryan nation.

316
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
This is absurd.

317
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,700
I'm not in a prison gang.
I'm in the rotary club.

318
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,200
I don't even know
what to make of this.

319
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,600
Well, let me see
if I can help you out.

320
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,100
You see, two guards come down
from the maximum-security prison in Salem,

321
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,800
and, in the course of two hours,
we uncover the leader of the Aryan nation.

322
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,700
- Now, what does that tell you?
- Huh?

323
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
You're sitting
on a powder keg, son!

324
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,200
I have to report this. Yeah.

325
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,900
Y-you --
You're reporting me?

326
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,800
That's two strikes.

327
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,700
One more,
and I go to Salem.

328
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,600
I can't go
to maximum security.

329
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,300
You know, I'm gonna have to
call my little boy,

330
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,000
tell him, "Daddy's not gonna be
home for a while.

331
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,800
Just be strong for your mama.
Be strong, little Lamond."

332
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
Holdings.

333
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,200
Okay. Who are you guys -- feds?
Playing hardball?

334
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,700
I'm sorry,
what are you--what?

335
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,500
Listen, listen.

336
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,500
The payment to Lamond Holdings
was made to someone named George Gilbert.

337
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,100
- Who is George Gilbert?
- I don't know.

338
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,100
Blanchard said to keep it to ourselves
because the mob was involved.

339
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,000
That's all I know.
I swear.

340
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,800
I don't want to die
in a prison riot.

341
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,300
Please,
call off your dogs.

342
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,900
Sorry, PJ. Time's up.

343
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,000
All right, so, Blanchard paid the mob $50,000
to kill someone named George Gilbert for Kimball.

344
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,600
This should be
an interesting meeting.

345
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,700
What dog--
Do I have dogs?

346
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,600
Nate, I've been searching for
a George Gilbert with mob ties circa 1980,

347
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,800
and I'm coming up empty.
Are you sure your intel is correct?

348
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm positive.

349
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,000
Listen, Hardison,
if we cancel this meeting,

350
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,400
we lose all credibility
with Blanchard. All right?

351
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,800
It's our only shot.
So, please, get me an answer.

352
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,100
I got you.
I got you.

353
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,500
Peter Blanchard.

354
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,800
Jimmy Popodokolos, uh...

355
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,000
Esquire.

356
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
I like to know
who I'm dealing with.

357
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
"James Popodokolos.

358
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:22,300
"Graduated from University Nevada,"
Reno Law School, 1993.

359
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,800
"Took the Nevada bar exam
three times.

360
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,400
Disbarred two years ago."

361
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,900
No. Uh, suspended. Okay?

362
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,400
It was turned
into a suspension.

363
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,700
Yeah. I mean, you can
call them up. I'm good to go.

364
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,200
What brings a suspended lawyer
from Las Vegas to my office today?

365
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,200
Can I just... You strike me
as a Harvard man.

366
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,200
- Class of '77.
- I knew it.

367
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,000
If I'm sitting here,
and I'm thinking

368
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,400
what it must have been like
for a guy like you, a Harvard man,

369
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,700
to get those calls at 3:00 in the morning
from Bennett Kimball --

370
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,100
sports car wrapped around a tree,
another pimp with an unpaid bill.

371
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,200
See, I like to know
who I'm dealing with, too.

372
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,800
What do you want?

373
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,100
I want to tell you
a story...

374
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,400
A story about man
who wrote a check for $50,000

375
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,900
in 1980 to Lamond Holdings.

376
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,300
I wrote a lot of checks to
a lot of companies. So what?

377
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,300
So, well... I happen to know
what the payment was for.

378
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,100
So, you know, we can --
We can do this game,

379
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,800
or you can start
talking compensation.

380
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,300
And let's just get to it.
All right, because it's what I do.

381
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,600
Nate, Nate, the payment was not
for George Gilbert.

382
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,800
It was for Georgia Gilbert.

383
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
It wasn't a contract killing, man.

384
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,300
I'm so--
You -- You've got nothing.

385
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,100
Bra, you in there
with nothing.

386
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,300
Better talk about your mama.

387
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,000
Okay, I got you.
Look.

388
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,700
Georgia Gilbert --
She was a stripper.

389
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,200
She moved to vegas
back in 1980.

390
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,400
Lamond Holdings was set up
to pay her $50,000.

391
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,300
- You okay?
- Um...

392
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,600
Georgia Gilbert.
Name ring a bell? Stripper.

393
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,700
Yeah, your blue-blood
client Kimball

394
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,000
fell in love
with a striper, didn't he?

395
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,500
I know
what you did here.

396
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,700
You sent her out to Vegas
with $50,000

397
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,100
that was laundered
through a holding company.

398
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,600
That's -- I bet you didn't
even tell Kimball something.

399
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,000
Or if you did, what?
She ran away?

400
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,750
It was for his own good.

401
00:21:18,751 --> 00:21:20,500
He wanted to marry her,
for God's sake.

402
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,700
Mr. Popodokolos,

403
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,800
I will see that
it would have been a scandal.

404
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,600
But Mr. Kimball is dead.
I don't see the...?

405
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,400
You don't see the relevance?

406
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,100
No.

407
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,400
Georgia Gilbert
was pregnant.

408
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,100
Hmm?

409
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,300
Is that relevant?

410
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,500
Hardison,
was she pregnant?

411
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,900
Like, how would I know?

412
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,400
I can't even find the girl's
social security number.

413
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,100
Just give me 5 seconds.

414
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,000
Can I please have
5 seconds?

415
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,900
How would you know?
She wouldn't say anything.

416
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,600
I mean, you sent her
out to Vegas,

417
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,600
and the local syndicate
probably said,

418
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,600
"We're gonna put you in the ground
in cement if you ever contact Kimball."

419
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,600
What you have here
is a situation

420
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,500
where your millionaire's
natural-born daughter

421
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,200
has come out of the woodwork
and wants a payout.

422
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,700
- Where is she?
- Who?

423
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,200
- The daughter.
- The daughter.

424
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,900
- Of Georgia Gilbert?
- Mm-Hmm.

425
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,200
Is it safe to see her now?

426
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
Sure.

427
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,000
All right.
Safe to meet her.

428
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,200
We're talking a safe environment?

429
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,300
Oh! Safe!

430
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,700
Uh, yeah.
Come on in.

431
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,500
Mr. Blanchard, I'd like you
to meet Lizzy Cantrell,

432
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,100
born Lizzy Gilbert.

433
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,800
What was she doing
out there?

434
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Um... stealing.
She has a meth problem.

435
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,000
I... do.
I love meth.

436
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,200
But she cleans up
really nice for a judge.

437
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,000
You know, and,
oh, boy, when she starts crying

438
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,500
about how, you know --
Growing up without daddy, huh?

439
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,500
Whoo, yeah!

440
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,700
That's why
I love the meth.

441
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,600
- You're playing me.
- Oh, really? Playing you. Fine.

442
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,100
All right, let's go
to a judge right now, huh?

443
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Yeah, or strike a deal
with her right now.

444
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,900
Strike a deal with her
just like you did with her mom.

445
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,600
Only add a few zeros --
Add a few --

446
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,600
Really?
Bye-Bye.

447
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
Come on.
Let's go, Lizzy. Let's go.

448
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,600
- We're gonna go get meth.
- We'll go get you some meth.

449
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,700
I was one digit away
from cracking that safe. One digit.

450
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,300
Yeah, no, this is much,
much better than the safe.

451
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,100
I got everything on Georgia Gilbert,
and I mean everything.

452
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,900
She was born
May 15, 1960.

453
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,600
Graduated St. Mary's.

454
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,200
She failed
her driver's test three times.

455
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,100
She's color-blind. She wears
a size-6 dress, size-8 shoe,

456
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,500
and how in the world
did you know she was pregnant?

457
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,100
Wait, she was pregnant?
Yeah. Gave the baby up for adoption.

458
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,900
What happened to Georgia?

459
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:55,700
She died in 1985. Cancer.

460
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,800
Tough draw.

461
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,300
Well, it wasn't really a guess.

462
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,700
I mean, for decades, Kimball --

463
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,800
He had a lot of women
on the side.

464
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,400
Avoided a lot of scandal, right?

465
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,100
So, what made him decide to marry
Georgia Gilbert over all those women?

466
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,600
Blanchard paid her off, and Kimball
just thought she ran out on him.

467
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,700
Now, how did you know
that the baby was a girl?

468
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,400
Oh. Oh, yeah. No, that --
That was a guess.

469
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,400
Yeah. Yeah.

470
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,000
I mean, but, you know,
that's a 50/50 deal.

471
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,600
Why don't you find
the real daughter?

472
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,300
Adoption records are sealed.
Paper only.

473
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,700
I have a reference number,
but nobody?

474
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,800
All this is good up until
Blanchard wants a DNA test.

475
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,600
I got to admit say,
even with my bag of tricks,

476
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,500
I can't rewrite
Parker's genetic code.

477
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,900
Yeah, so we just have to convince him

478
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,800
that asking Ror the DNA is the worst
possible choice he could make.

479
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,300
- How do we do that?
- We don't.

480
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,200
Then this lowlife extortionist
comes into my office

481
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,000
and says that he's found
Kimball's lost daughter.

482
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,700
Yes. He was here, too.
Wanted a payoff.

483
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,700
Now...

484
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,500
I know you and I are
on opposite sides of this,

485
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,200
but I think we can agree
that this Popodokolos fellow?

486
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,400
Has no regard for the law.

487
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,600
He's seedy. He's a disgrace
to the profession.

488
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,100
- I say we get?
- Absolutely.

489
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,400
Of course, once we enter
the DNA into evidence,

490
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,800
then we have to live with it.

491
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,000
So if she is the daughter,
she gets everything.

492
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,500
This file is from Popodokolos.

493
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,200
I tied the adoption-reference number

494
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,500
to the medical records
of one of Parker's aliases.

495
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,500
Social security, taxes,
long record of drug offenses.

496
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,500
Anybody sht of the CIA
Is gonna believe that is Kimball.

497
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm beginning to think
we should consider a settlement.

498
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,300
No. Absolutely not. My client's
position is that we will fight this

499
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,400
in probate for years
if we have to.

500
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,700
Years?

501
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,200
So, how was I?

502
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,200
I think you were enjoying
yourself there at the end.

503
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,100
No. Well...
maybe a little.

504
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,500
And now we see if Blanchard
is a gambling man.

505
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,600
Right? Want him to be?

506
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,900
Not a gambling man.

507
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,900
Okay.

508
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,200
Hmm.

509
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,600
Well of it checks out,
so if we get a DNA test --

510
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,700
If a DNA test goes into evidence,
There's no turning back.

511
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,200
This is not an inheritance.
I earned this.

512
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,700
I did things no lawyer,
No one should be asked to do.

513
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,100
She cannot show up
at that hearing tomorrow.

514
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,500
So pay her.

515
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,900
Things happen to drug addicts.

516
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:26,100
In a strange city,
don't know a safe place to?

517
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,800
Things happen.

518
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,200
Cindy...

519
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,600
Set up a meeting with Popod?
The girl.

520
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,600
Lind will tell you
where and when.

521
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,500
Ms. Carlisle,
are you ready?

522
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,900
Uh, I never thought
i would say this.

523
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,100
But I hope Mr. Ford

524
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,700
because I don't think we have a case.

525
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,600
By the time the hearing starts,
We'll have a check in our hands.

526
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,600
This is where he said.

527
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,300
Nate!

528
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,400
You want this?

529
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,600
Well, he was convinced,
all right.

530
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,600
Good plan.

531
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,100
No, no, no.
This is. This is good.

532
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:25,100
We get you to the hearing,

533
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,000
???

534
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,900
Just to keep you from getting
in front of that judge.

535
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,600
But just get make sure
that Parker, uh...

536
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,100
Make sure she gets
to the hearing...

537
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,800
No matter what.

538
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,000
They had backup.

539
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
They're on the way
to the courthouse.

540
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,600
She can't get to that hearing.

541
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,900
Thanks.
Calling like he said.

542
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,700
You heard shots,
found him like this.

543
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,900
Tell them the blonde did it,
And she's headed to the courthouse.

544
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,600
Are you kidding me?

545
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,400
Look at this.

546
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,700
Hardison,
give me some good news.

547
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,200
Well, I got some news for you.

548
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,800
They just put out
an apb on parker.

549
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,800
It says she's a late-20s
Caucasian women

550
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,800
who shot a officer, she's
an addict, and she's armed.

551
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,200
A trifecta.

552
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,300
Hardison, how good's
the description of her?

553
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,900
- Freeze! Police! Hold it right there!
- Pretty good.

554
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,200
Hold it!
Stop right there!

555
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,800
Chard, your? Just --
Went to inform a drug addict

556
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,400
That we would not
be blackmailed.

557
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
She flew into? And gunned him down.

558
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,200
- That will never hold up.
- Maybe.

559
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,600
Is she willing to bet 5 to
10 years of her life on that?

560
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,600
Smartest thing for her to do is crawl
back to Vegas and just disappear.

561
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,500
All right, Hardison, listen?
You got to delay him.

562
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,600
Buy us some time.

563
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,100
How do you expect me
to do that?

564
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,500
I don't know.
Use your imagination.

565
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,400
Just use my imagination.

566
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,200
Yo, my man.
Can I have that?

567
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,300
Yeah.

568
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,000
We're cut off.
We're gonna have to get rough.

569
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,900
I ain't hitting cops.

570
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,700
I look forward to seeing you
explain that.

571
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,100
Anyone besides you
gonna wander through that door?

572
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,800
Your honor, I don't know what could
have held up the other lawyers.

573
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,900
Next person walks through
that door, we're starting.

574
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,800
- Ohh!
- Oh, oh. I'm sorry, man.

575
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,100
- Are you okay?
- Don't worry about it. I'm fine.

576
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,000
I'm good. I'm good.

577
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,200
I'm fine?

578
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,700
No, got it?

579
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,000
Are you okay,
Mr. Blanchard?

580
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,600
It's all right, Don.
Everything's fine.

581
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,300
Oh, thank you very much
okay.

582
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,000
- My bad, man.
- No problem, no problem.

583
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,200
Okay

584
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,600
Hey. You, sir,
have a swell day.

585
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,100
- You, too.
- A swell day.

586
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,200
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

587
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,400
Oh.

588
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,900
These aren't my keys.

589
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,700
Oh, my God!

590
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,500
??? Naked
for everyone.

591
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,100
Gun. Gun.

592
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,900
- Hold it!
- No!

593
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,700
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait a minute!

594
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,000
Whoa! Stop!

595
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,500
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

596
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,700
All right. Be cool.

597
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,400
All right. Nothing's gonna
happen to anybody.

598
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,700
Just settle down.

599
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,000
Not using?
Hold on. Stop.

600
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,400
Chill. All right?
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

601
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,800
Drop it!

602
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,100
Listen, it's probably best if you pretend
that you never saw us. Okay?

603
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,300
Stop!

604
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,400
Nate, I did do, but --

605
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,700
Peter Blanchard,
your honor.

606
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,700
My apologies,
but I was held up at security.

607
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,000
Security is always there.
You should take that into account.

608
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,500
Now, Mr. James Popodokolos
has entered an appearance.

609
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,200
Do we know where he is?

610
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,700
We should perhaps wait --

611
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,100
I do not believe he will be
coming in, your honor.

612
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,000
Fine. We have a full docket today.
Let's get this thing moving.

613
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:05,300
Nate, I hope you have a plan "B"
or "F" or something? First half alphabet.

614
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,400
Yes, but it depends
on our Ms. Carlisle.

615
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,100
The librarian?

616
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,600
Ready, Ms. Carlisle?

617
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,400
Yes, your honor.

618
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,500
All right.
Eliot, what's your 20?

619
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,800
Every entrance is covered.

620
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,400
Parker's trying to find
another way in.

621
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,300
Okay, Parker,
forget about the hearing.

622
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,400
I need you to do something else.

623
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,900
And when you saw Mr. Kimball last week,
What was his mental state?

624
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,100
He didn't even know who I was.
He kept cag me Gigi.

625
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,600
How did that compare with your last visit
with him months ago?

626
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,100
It was completely different.

627
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,700
He was frail then,
but his mind was still sharp.

628
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Thank you.

629
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,100
No further questions,
your honor.

630
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,900
Your witness,
Mr. Blanchard.

631
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,900
These are Bennett Kimball's
medical records,

632
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,000
which I have entered
into evidence.

633
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,400
They state that he was declared
incompetent over two years ago.

634
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:08,400
Isn't it true, Ms. Walton, that even if
you could produce this new will,

635
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:13,000
which you can't, it would have been the product
of a man deep in the throes of dementia?

636
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,600
No. He was fine.
He was fine.

637
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,400
???Olos.
Sorry for my tardiness.

638
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,400
Judge, we're
already under way here.

639
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,700
And I don't want to go
through this a second time.

640
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,300
- Mr. Popodokolos...
- that's me.

641
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,500
...has filed that he represents
a missing heir.

642
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,800
Hmm?

643
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,500
I will hear him out.

644
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,700
Now?

645
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,500
Mm-Hmm.
Yes, now.

646
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,000
Uh, yeah.

647
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,700
Your honor, if you just give me a moment
collect my thoughts, gather my papers, and...

648
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,100
yeah, and, again,
sorry for the tardiness.

649
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,600
And, uh, I like a wise
latina judge. I like it.

650
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,400
Thanks for keeping it going
till I got here.

651
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,200
You can't pretend to be a lawyer
in a courtroom.

652
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,500
Well, stick around. I'm about to
practice micine, too.

653
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,300
Your honor, I'd like to offer
into evidence

654
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,800
these documents
showing a payment

655
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,500
that Mr. Blanchard
made to a Georgia Gilbert,

656
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:11,100
A woman I contend
bore Mr. Kimball's child.

657
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,600
Yes, your honor.
Mr. Popodokoli--

658
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,800
It's Popodokolos.

659
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,100
Pokodolokos.

660
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,300
- Pop-- Pop--
- Popodokolos.

661
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,100
This man spun
these fairy tales in my office.

662
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,500
It's a shakedown
from a disbarred...

663
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,600
Suspended.

664
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,300
...ambulance chaser from las vagas.

665
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,500
And he says that he found
Bennett Kimball's daughter.

666
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,000
So, I only have one question for him.

667
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,900
Where is she?

668
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,400
I could produce her,
your honor,

669
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,700
if you just allow me to ask
the witness one question,

670
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,100
one question
to the witness.

671
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,300
Please.

672
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,200
- Okay?
- Ask.

673
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,600
Thank you, your honor.

674
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,100
Ms. Walton...

675
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:04,600
What color is my tie.

676
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,000
I don't know.
I'm color-blind.

677
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,900
Hmm.
Color-blind.

678
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,700
You're, uh...

679
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,700
Ah. Yes. What I have here,
your honor --

680
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,900
These are the medical records
for Bennett Kimball,

681
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:28,300
which Mr. Blanchard here was kind enough
to offer into evidence...

682
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,600
Which he was. Now, it states
that Mr. Kimball is color-blind.

683
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,800
Hmm.

684
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,400
Now, what we have here is --

685
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,400
It says that Georgia Gilbert
is color-Blind.

686
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,300
On the Massachusetts application
for a driver's license.

687
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,000
Blue irises.
They were his favorite.

688
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,500
She failed
her driver's test three times.

689
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,600
She's color-blind.

690
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,700
Now, it's rare for a woman
to be color-blind.

691
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,200
It takes a color-blind father,
a color-blind mother

692
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,100
to produce a child
who's color-blind.

693
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,700
Wait, are --
Are you saying

694
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,800
that I'm Bennett Kimball's
daughter?

695
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,900
???

696
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,600
You opened the door,
counselor.

697
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,200
It's no coincidence, is it, that you started
a program helping foster kids get adopted.

698
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,600
No coincidence.
Is it, Ms. Walton?

699
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,600
No. I was adopted myself.

700
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,600
Yes, in 1982.

701
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,700
You were 2 years old.
State of Nevada.

702
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Yes.

703
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,600
And the last time
you saw Bennett Kimball,

704
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,600
he called you
by a different name, didn't he?

705
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,200
What was it?

706
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,700
Gigi.

707
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,400
No, it's Ruth.

708
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,700
- I'm your friend!
- Gigi! Gigi!

709
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,900
G. G. Yeah?

710
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,200
Georgia Gilbert.

711
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,400
G. G. Hmm?

712
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,600
That's who he was looking at
when he saw you at that day.

713
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:16,100
Your birth mother...
The woman he loved and lost in 1980.

714
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,100
Your honor...

715
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,000
Bennett Kimball
didn't call Ms. Walton here

716
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,500
out of the blue
to donate money to her charity.

717
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,200
He searched for her.

718
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,900
He searched for his daughter.

719
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,300
I move to strike Mr. Popodokos' evidence
from the record based on the fact

720
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,900
that I haven't been able to get adequate time
to review these outlandish claims

721
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,800
and prepare a proper response.

722
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,500
- Popodokolos.
- Popodokolos!

723
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,800
I agree, your honor.

724
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And I would also like to add a motion
to compel a DNA test to put to rest any doubt.

725
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,600
That my client
is Mr. Kimball's daughter.

726
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,900
The truth will win out.

727
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,500
Motion granted.
When we?

728
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:11,100
???

729
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,700
We're adjourned.

730
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,200
You honestly think
this will hold up?

731
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,000
You know, for a Harvard man,
you're not too sharp there.

732
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,800
You know, you tried to keep
Kimball's daughter out of the courtroom,

733
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,600
she walks right
in the front door.

734
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,800
Sorry I'm late.

735
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,500
I was just at your office
cleaning out your safe.

736
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,800
Hey, Parker,
forget about the hearing.

737
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,800
I need you to do something else.

738
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,200
Those files -- Whoo! --
That was a lot of dirt.

739
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,900
I gave them
to your special cop friend.

740
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,600
Oh, who's not too happy
with you, by the way, since you shot him.

741
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,400
I guess you can't pay him off
With any of the Kimball estate money.

742
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,700
What the hell is this?

743
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,900
Hey, you don't understand!
These people are thieves!

744
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,800
???

745
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,100
And if he's Greek, I'm?

746
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,300
So, do you still think law
is the only pathway to justice?

747
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,600
Now more than ever.

748
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,900
I'd like to think that you
learned something from me today.

749
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,300
Certainly.

750
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,800
Why would he go to all that out trouble
to find me and noll me he wasy father?

751
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,400
Well, I mean, think about it
from his perspective.

752
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,300
If he had told you the truth, how do you
think you would have reacted?

753
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,700
I would have asked him
why it took him so long.

754
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,400
I would have been
really angry.

755
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,300
Yeah, so instead, it's like
he got to start from scratch.

756
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,800
And by leaving his fortune
to your charity,

757
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,000
it's almost like he's atoning
for mistakes he made in his life.

758
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,100
The kind, generous Bennett Kimball
is the one I knew,

759
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,900
And that's how
I'm gonna remember him.

760
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,400
My lawyer? I never met
her before this week.

761
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,200
She told me she was with you.

762
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,700
Took you long enough.

763
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,800
- Who are you?
- Tara Cole.

764
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,400
I'm a friend of Sophie's.

765
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,300
She said you guys were shorthanded,
asked me to help. It's all in there.

766
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,800
So. You help out lying to us?

767
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,100
I wanted to see
just how good you really are

768
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,000
and show you just how good I am.
You can consider it my audition.

769
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,900
I bet you're not even
a lawyer.

770
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,200
- Oh. Sophie was right. You are adorable.
- Excuse me?

771
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,300
See how good we are?

772
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,400
Hey, hold on!
Hey, hey!

773
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,100
Guys, guys.

774
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,600
She's right. Sophie did send her.

775
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,500
And Sophie asked us
to give Tara here a shot.

776
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,000
Well play.
Welcome aboard.

777
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,800
Thanks.

778
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,500
Adorable.

779
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,200
Whoa, whoa, hold up. Mnh-Mnh.
Hold up, hold up. What is this?

780
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,600
Oh?

781
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,100
For my cut of the inheritance.

782
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,500
Hey, I'm not a candy striper.
This is my job.

783
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,900
There. See?
We're getting paid already.

784
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,600
It's gonna be fun.

785
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,600
