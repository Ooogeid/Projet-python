1
00:00:00,584 --> 00:00:03,697
<i>Report to an explosion
at the Bellbridge port authority.</i>

2
00:00:03,822 --> 00:00:07,510
<i>Both homeland security and the FBI</i>
<i>assure us this is not a terrorist act.</i>

3
00:00:07,635 --> 00:00:09,460
<i>Be on the lookout
for a black town car.</i>

4
00:00:09,585 --> 00:00:11,768
<i>The suspects are considered
armed and dangerous.</i>

5
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:15,414
<i>Season 2 Episode 15
The Maltese Falcon Job</i>

6
00:00:16,284 --> 00:00:18,507
The mayor's a federal witness?
Federal?

7
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:21,094
Every badge in a hundred miles
is looking for us.

8
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,998
Guys, they are ripping through
Nate and Tara's cover stories.

9
00:00:25,123 --> 00:00:28,206
All their financials are blown, so,
until I know what they know,

10
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:30,612
No credit cards,
no debit cards, no atms,

11
00:00:30,737 --> 00:00:32,523
nothing that can be
traced back to us.

12
00:00:32,648 --> 00:00:33,669
Cash in hand only.

13
00:00:33,794 --> 00:00:35,701
- Better and better.
- The mayor's not innocent.

14
00:00:35,826 --> 00:00:37,841
He cut a deal with the feds
because he's guilty.

15
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:39,830
he's got somebody working
on the outside.

16
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,809
- He admitted he has an accomplice.
- Do we scatter or stay?

17
00:00:42,934 --> 00:00:45,018
No, we scatter, we give
the mayor and his partner

18
00:00:45,143 --> 00:00:47,712
time to cover their tracks
to get away with murder, literally.

19
00:00:47,837 --> 00:00:50,435
We can't get anything done out here.
We need a hiding place.

20
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,383
When I contacted
the FBI team leader,

21
00:00:52,508 --> 00:00:55,469
I put a worm in the operating system
in the sim card on her phone...

22
00:00:55,594 --> 00:00:57,336
Hardison, geek spiral.

23
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,712
We can listen to what they say.

24
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:00,810
Look.

25
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,166
<i>No, not a safe house.</i>

26
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,605
<i>Interpol wants Culpepper
someplace off our system.</i>

27
00:01:05,144 --> 00:01:06,904
<i>We're taking him
to the Governor Hotel.</i>

28
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:08,501
That's where we're gonna hole up.

29
00:01:08,809 --> 00:01:10,180
The Governor Hotel?

30
00:01:10,457 --> 00:01:12,800
- The hotel crawling with FBI?
- FBI and interpol.

31
00:01:12,925 --> 00:01:15,973
It's the one place in Boston
they won't be looking for us.

32
00:01:16,098 --> 00:01:17,758
We just got to get there first.

33
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:26,816
Room service.

34
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,297
All right.

35
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:33,912
Three, maybe four empty rooms
on this floor.

36
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:36,971
I steal that master key, he's gonna
notice it's missing pretty fast.

37
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,493
All right, Parker,
I need you to do a lift.

38
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:42,124
- She just said...
- No, not the key.

39
00:01:42,611 --> 00:01:43,761
Just a towel.

40
00:01:46,593 --> 00:01:47,593
Excuse me.

41
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:52,570
I stepped out to get the paper,
and then my door closed behind me.

42
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:56,157
I tried to find a house phone,
but you guys don't have those anymore.

43
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,136
Did I miss something?

44
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:19,461
She was naked.

45
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:22,484
In-room checkout.

46
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:26,687
This means that I have access
to the hotel's billing computers.

47
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:30,312
It's a big old backdoor
into every hotel room in america.

48
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,282
As of right now,
we have been here for a week,

49
00:02:33,407 --> 00:02:35,494
and our reservations are good
for another week.

50
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:39,366
Courtesy of this man's platinum card,
Mr. Ogden Shields,

51
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:43,074
who has spent a lot of time
in the adult section of pay-per-view.

52
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,415
- Did he even leave the room?
- "Indy panties day"?

53
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:49,794
Hardison, I need background
on all the mayor's business partners

54
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,596
and all his little shell companies.

55
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:54,298
You want background checks
on this, a TV?

56
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,257
Yeah, I'll have super mario
and dig dug get right on that.

57
00:02:57,382 --> 00:03:00,171
Guns, anything having
to do with guns.

58
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:02,298
I'm gonna go get some keys made.

59
00:03:02,423 --> 00:03:04,755
I'm going to the gym. Make sure
I can charge stuff on the room.

60
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,762
I got you.

61
00:03:08,284 --> 00:03:10,356
She really wants that car clean.

62
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,942
That's enough of that.

63
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:20,769
- Excuse me.
- That's all right.

64
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:29,839
Hello.

65
00:03:29,964 --> 00:03:32,678
- I was down in the gym.
- The fitness spa.

66
00:03:32,803 --> 00:03:35,174
Isn't the zen steam garden divine?

67
00:03:36,686 --> 00:03:39,679
Delicious. I was down in the gym,
and I went back up to my room,

68
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:42,513
- and my key didn't work.
- No problem. Do you have any ID?

69
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:45,314
Who carries their ID to the gym?

70
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,544
- True.
- Ogden Shields, room 1104.

71
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:51,897
Here you go, Mr. Shields.
Let me reformat that card for you.

72
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,870
Parker, Eliot, meet me outside.
Tara, Hardison, stay in your room.

73
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:07,705
- <i>Door closed.</i>
- Why?

74
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:17,105
Yes, like the machine gun,
not the engine.

75
00:04:17,714 --> 00:04:19,884
You've been a very bad boy today.

76
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,290
No, I did everything I was supposed to.
Please, agent Nevins, tell him.

77
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:25,267
The mayor's been
a cooperating witness.

78
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:27,568
A snitch. World loves a snitch.

79
00:04:27,693 --> 00:04:30,426
I will not have you talking
to my witness like that.

80
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:32,421
Before you finish that thought,

81
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:34,565
let's review, shall we?

82
00:04:35,153 --> 00:04:37,769
You allowed multiple suspects
to escape from a warehouse

83
00:04:37,894 --> 00:04:40,613
completely surrounded by FBI agents

84
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,613
before they got away with $250,000

85
00:04:43,738 --> 00:04:45,084
of FBI bribe money.

86
00:04:45,793 --> 00:04:47,494
And they got away in your car.

87
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:54,579
Sure he's safe here?

88
00:04:54,704 --> 00:04:56,812
You want to tell me
why that's any of your business?

89
00:04:56,937 --> 00:05:00,829
Because, during the course
of my first investigation for Interpol,

90
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:04,188
the city of Bellbridge
drifted into my vision.

91
00:05:04,898 --> 00:05:07,176
Your little operation came up.

92
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:10,547
Imagine my surprise and delight
when I saw Nathan Ford

93
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:12,108
in the FBI case files.

94
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:14,945
Nathan?
No, his name's Lionel Gitt.

95
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:17,829
That's adorable. Tell you what.

96
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,663
I'll have my people give you
everything you need to know

97
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:22,756
about Nathan Ford and his crew,

98
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:26,659
and you give me everything you have
on a man named Tony Kadjic.

99
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:30,720
All right, guys, this is Tony Kadjic.
He started out as a smuggler in Albania.

100
00:05:30,845 --> 00:05:33,165
He left a lot of competitors
in shallow graves.

101
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,071
<i>He's been indicted
for murder eight times</i>

102
00:05:35,196 --> 00:05:37,294
<i>in four different countries
with zero convictions.</i>

103
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,343
His shipping company
looks semi-legit

104
00:05:39,468 --> 00:05:41,757
and is tied to governments
in the 'stans, central america.

105
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:45,386
It's got big government contracts,
including some for US Security forces.

106
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:46,771
Why do we care about him?

107
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:48,928
<i>'cause he's big on the
surplus-weapons market.</i>

108
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:52,768
- A polite way of saying arms dealer.
- <i>His specialty is buying cheap guns</i>

109
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,975
from third-world countries
and reselling them.

110
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,514
<i>This tracks. So, the mayor
grifts the 9/11 money</i>

111
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,651
<i>that's meant to improve
security at the ports.</i>

112
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,179
That, along with crooked cops,
makes the Bellbridge port

113
00:06:04,304 --> 00:06:07,271
a perfect place for Tony Kadjic to run
his guns in and out of the country.

114
00:06:07,396 --> 00:06:09,258
Interpol must be chasing
down the gunrunning.

115
00:06:09,383 --> 00:06:10,837
Don't worry about Sterling.

116
00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:13,261
Did you just say don't
worry about Sterling?

117
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:14,835
Yeah, don't worry about Sterling.

118
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:17,206
What, you don't think
I can beat Sterling?

119
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:18,877
<i>I think in the last six months,</i>

120
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,985
I've heard you talk about
beating the triads,

121
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,488
beating the russians, all right?

122
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,237
Maggie's boyfriend?
How'd that work out?

123
00:06:26,362 --> 00:06:28,245
We all said
that meet was a bad idea.

124
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,543
But you got a taste for taking down
this mayor, and you can't resist.

125
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:34,252
- You want to walk away, walk away.
- That's not my job.

126
00:06:34,377 --> 00:06:37,513
My job is to get your back.
I'm gonna do it all the way down.

127
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,232
But I need you to do your job.

128
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,401
- And what's that?
- Be Nathan Ford.

129
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:44,953
Be the person we came back for.

130
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:51,490
Listen, guys.

131
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:54,246
<i>I'm trying to figure out why a group
of very rich, very powerful men</i>

132
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,329
are trying to take out
a good, decent cop.

133
00:06:56,454 --> 00:06:58,932
Are you gonna stick with me on this?
Is that enough?

134
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,006
Us too.

135
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:09,414
<i>Good. Tony Kadjic</i>
is the one who pulled the trigger.

136
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:11,764
I want to know exactly
what he's up to and where he is.

137
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:14,349
And how do you propose we do that?

138
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,610
Let's go steal a mayor.

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,563
That's still bugging me, man.

140
00:07:29,795 --> 00:07:31,195
<i>You guys on the move?</i>

141
00:07:32,003 --> 00:07:34,527
- We're both heading out now.
- And the mayor?

142
00:07:34,652 --> 00:07:36,580
<i>According to the
room-service charges,</i>

143
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,899
looks like the mayor's taking
the edge off of captivity

144
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:40,844
with many tiny bottles of vodka.

145
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,538
I'm sorry, ma'am.

146
00:07:53,196 --> 00:07:55,641
But I have mini-bar.

147
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:56,912
Gimme.

148
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:19,315
Great. Look who's back.

149
00:08:27,262 --> 00:08:29,114
This is Sterling. I'm on my way up.

150
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:30,489
<i>Target secured.</i>

151
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:38,551
You help Tara and Parker.
I'm gonna stall Sterling.

152
00:08:38,676 --> 00:08:40,935
- <i>How?</i>
- I'm thinking.

153
00:10:16,394 --> 00:10:18,242
Agent Nevins says
you're to have full access.

154
00:10:22,115 --> 00:10:22,996
All right.

155
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:30,286
Your name's Bob, right?

156
00:10:30,515 --> 00:10:31,317
Yes, sir.

157
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:33,815
- You've been here the whole time, Bob?
- Yes, sir.

158
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,760
And nobody's gone in
or out of here, Bob?

159
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:38,303
No, sir.

160
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,848
Then would you mind explaining
where the hell the mayor is!

161
00:11:00,174 --> 00:11:01,597
Housekeeping.

162
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,211
Stop. I got this.
Stop. I don't need help.

163
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,671
Clearly you do.

164
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,841
I got this. I got this.
Go on.

165
00:11:23,994 --> 00:11:25,194
Eliot Spencer.

166
00:11:27,371 --> 00:11:29,161
There! That's it.

167
00:11:29,951 --> 00:11:32,710
The trunk, the mayor's in the trunk.
Find it!

168
00:11:33,088 --> 00:11:34,667
I'm running down the taxi license.

169
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:36,651
Have the state troopers
set up roadblocks

170
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:39,260
on every highway in
and out of the city.

171
00:11:39,947 --> 00:11:40,951
You got it.

172
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,661
Thanks for making it
interesting, Nate.

173
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,847
Where's the luggage going?

174
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:55,852
Nashua, New Hampshire.

175
00:11:59,438 --> 00:12:02,728
Just like the picture, make sure
it looks exactly like his room.

176
00:12:19,671 --> 00:12:20,721
Your honor.

177
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:22,374
Chair.

178
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,325
Where are the agents?

179
00:12:27,604 --> 00:12:30,056
There should be two FBI agents
standing at the door.

180
00:12:31,698 --> 00:12:33,919
- Did you have to?
- She saw our faces.

181
00:12:35,311 --> 00:12:37,030
Put her in the tub with the others.

182
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:39,443
Mr. Joshua, get to work.
We don't have much time.

183
00:12:39,568 --> 00:12:41,845
- I'm sorry. Please, don't kill me.
- What did you think?

184
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,558
A guy that throws around the kind
of money I do, that I'm not connected?

185
00:12:44,683 --> 00:12:45,889
I didn't know that...

186
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,808
That you could just
throw me to the feds?

187
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,036
Look, I had to.

188
00:12:49,161 --> 00:12:51,672
It was nothing personal.
I had to protect...

189
00:12:51,797 --> 00:12:52,640
What?

190
00:12:56,588 --> 00:12:58,568
The guns.
The guns, the guns.

191
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,959
Look, I'll cut you in, okay?
It's a sweet deal.

192
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:04,199
The cops are in on the payroll.
And the feds just turn their heads.

193
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,702
- It's foolproof.
- How do the feds look the other way?

194
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,038
I wear a wire, okay?

195
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,499
I help the FBI get other mayors
and congressmen,

196
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,717
and they...

197
00:13:14,896 --> 00:13:17,587
they don't bother
with Tony's shipping business.

198
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,424
So Tony said to give them you,

199
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,426
to give you to the feds,

200
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,123
and then the heat would be off.

201
00:13:25,248 --> 00:13:28,559
Mr. Gitt, it was just business.

202
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:31,226
Just business.
I'd like to meet Tony.

203
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,895
I don't know where he is.

204
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,559
I'll get him on the phone.
I can get him on the phone for you.

205
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:39,025
If you'd like me to get him
on the phone, I can do that.

206
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,159
All right. He's here.

207
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,405
Where? Where is he?

208
00:13:44,177 --> 00:13:46,531
He's down at the docks.
He's on the boat.

209
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:48,024
We just got a shipment in.

210
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:50,745
And we've got some buyers
who are inspecting the guns.

211
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,164
Thank you very much.

212
00:13:52,512 --> 00:13:54,249
See, that wasn't so
difficult, was it?

213
00:14:00,162 --> 00:14:01,683
FBI's cleared the building.

214
00:14:05,641 --> 00:14:06,916
We kidnapped a mayor.

215
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,074
I hope you realize
that even if we pull this off,

216
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,392
we're gonna get out of the city
with nothing.

217
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:14,772
So, Kadjic has
a shipment at the docks.

218
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:18,273
Hardison, stash the mayor somewhere else
and see what you can dig up.

219
00:14:18,398 --> 00:14:20,432
If I can access the security
cameras at the port,

220
00:14:20,557 --> 00:14:22,444
maybe the facial recognition
can find Kadjic.

221
00:14:25,173 --> 00:14:26,746
Do a physical sweep of the docks.

222
00:14:31,318 --> 00:14:32,460
Where you going?

223
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,097
Where's he going?

224
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:43,474
This is Tara.

225
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:48,590
Listen, I need a favor.

226
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:50,944
I need you to get me
in touch with someone.

227
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:55,539
I want to make a deal...

228
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:57,887
with Tony Kadjic.

229
00:15:16,887 --> 00:15:18,079
You're not like them.

230
00:15:19,069 --> 00:15:21,670
You couldn't take the risk
that you'd never come back here...

231
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,132
Not without picking up a few things.

232
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,729
You're nicked.

233
00:15:49,624 --> 00:15:52,701
- Where's my witness?
- Do you know why you screwed up, Nate?

234
00:15:56,048 --> 00:15:57,497
You forgot who you are.

235
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,318
It was always only a matter of time
before this Robin Hood fantasy of yours

236
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:02,593
brought you here...

237
00:16:03,153 --> 00:16:04,253
to this end.

238
00:16:05,552 --> 00:16:08,685
You're gonna lecture me
on who the good guys and bad guys are?

239
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:12,637
The FBI's protecting a corrupt mayor,
and the guy you want, Tony Kadjic...

240
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,369
Giving him a free pass.
Is this true, agent Nevins?

241
00:16:15,494 --> 00:16:18,949
As far as we can tell, Mr. Kadjic
hasn't broken any american laws.

242
00:16:19,074 --> 00:16:21,129
And as a favor
to a protected witness,

243
00:16:21,254 --> 00:16:23,254
we don't harass
his business associates.

244
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:26,067
- Kadjic shot up a state policeman.
- Do you have proof of that?

245
00:16:27,782 --> 00:16:30,181
The mayor's brought us
a dozen good cases.

246
00:16:30,306 --> 00:16:33,033
- I made the right call.
- Well, it's out of your hands now.

247
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,193
I have plenty of proof
against Tony Kadjic...

248
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:37,909
Shipping manifests,
forged customs documents...

249
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:40,151
And against you, Nate...

250
00:16:40,276 --> 00:16:42,346
Photos of you setting the bribe
with the mayor,

251
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:44,709
tape of you talking about the bribe.

252
00:16:45,018 --> 00:16:47,906
Photos of your team
in their adorable little costumes,

253
00:16:48,031 --> 00:16:50,444
all sitting in a secure FBI locker,

254
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:52,552
awaiting my next
irrevocable phone call.

255
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:54,765
What are you waiting for?

256
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,015
The only thing I don't have
is Tony Kadjic himself.

257
00:16:58,206 --> 00:16:59,954
That must be very disappointing.

258
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:04,879
So I'm gonna make you a deal.

259
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:07,233
You find Kadjic,
tie him to the guns...

260
00:17:08,685 --> 00:17:09,945
I'll give you a free pass.

261
00:17:10,652 --> 00:17:11,655
Just this once,

262
00:17:12,254 --> 00:17:14,449
you get to walk away
with your record wiped clean.

263
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:16,493
My team?

264
00:17:18,197 --> 00:17:20,436
They go down,
every last one of them.

265
00:17:20,876 --> 00:17:22,381
They deserve to go down.

266
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,384
They're criminals, Nate...

267
00:17:24,697 --> 00:17:25,502
Thieves.

268
00:17:26,765 --> 00:17:29,455
So that's the deal.
You bring me Kadjic and the guns,

269
00:17:29,762 --> 00:17:33,022
and I cut you and you alone loose.

270
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:35,595
Because at the end of the day,

271
00:17:36,643 --> 00:17:37,902
you're always right.

272
00:17:39,194 --> 00:17:40,433
You're not a thief.

273
00:17:43,127 --> 00:17:44,740
This is your second chance.

274
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,149
This is hopeless.

275
00:17:57,768 --> 00:17:58,731
And it smells.

276
00:17:58,856 --> 00:18:01,175
- How many ships left on the list?
- On a hundred.

277
00:18:01,554 --> 00:18:02,406
Sweet.

278
00:18:04,913 --> 00:18:07,242
- This is hopeless.
- And it smells.

279
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:09,827
Yes, like old clown shoes.

280
00:18:09,952 --> 00:18:12,320
- Briny despair.
- Well, maybe Hardison...

281
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,200
What?

282
00:18:16,654 --> 00:18:17,804
He's italian.

283
00:18:22,298 --> 00:18:23,618
Bonanno's italian.

284
00:18:25,286 --> 00:18:26,986
So now he's walking off?

285
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:33,728
Sparky, slow down.

286
00:18:42,736 --> 00:18:43,736
It's me.

287
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,225
I screwed up.

288
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,860
Nate, is that you?

289
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:51,087
I can't hear you.

290
00:18:53,595 --> 00:18:56,232
Listen, I need you to come back.

291
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:01,473
I need you.

292
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:05,060
No, speak up. I'm traveling, and...

293
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:06,478
Not the team...

294
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:08,079
me.

295
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,256
For me,

296
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:11,023
not for a con.

297
00:19:13,374 --> 00:19:14,400
Listen,

298
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:17,572
I don't know who I am
anymore, Sophie.

299
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:21,096
And when I was chasing you,

300
00:19:21,221 --> 00:19:23,746
and we were doing cons,
I knew who I was, but not anymore.

301
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,872
As crazy as this sounds, I need you
to tell me when I'm going too far.

302
00:19:28,061 --> 00:19:29,461
I mean, it just...

303
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:32,921
it gets out of control,
and I just don't know who I am,

304
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:35,859
and you've always been...

305
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,469
... my compass. And,

306
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:44,029
you know, I care about you
more than you'll ever know, because I...

307
00:19:46,006 --> 00:19:46,809
I...

308
00:19:47,574 --> 00:19:48,463
you...

309
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:52,609
I can't hear you!

310
00:19:56,675 --> 00:19:58,175
What rubbish signal.

311
00:20:27,941 --> 00:20:30,591
It's safe.
It's all clear in my apartment.

312
00:20:32,351 --> 00:20:34,409
I want you to stash
the mayor in a closet

313
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:36,184
<i>And get the team over here.</i>

314
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:38,111
- You got a plan?
- <i>Yes, I do...</i>

315
00:20:38,768 --> 00:20:41,238
One that's gonna take
care of everybody.

316
00:20:44,992 --> 00:20:45,994
Is it possible?

317
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,802
I'll need Eliot
and to buy some new supplies

318
00:20:49,927 --> 00:20:51,149
and maybe five hours.

319
00:20:51,274 --> 00:20:54,067
Plus I need to hack into
the cargo-shipping system at the docks.

320
00:20:54,192 --> 00:20:55,461
What about the money?

321
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:58,046
- It's on short notice, but...
- use my accounts.

322
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,380
- That'll clean you out.
- Use them.

323
00:21:02,482 --> 00:21:04,782
And what about you guys on your end?

324
00:21:05,882 --> 00:21:08,127
I don't think we can make it
in through the main entrance,

325
00:21:08,252 --> 00:21:11,014
I think we need to go up and then
make it down through from the roof.

326
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:13,730
- But you can do it.
- Sure. That's impossible.

327
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:17,044
- No, it's everything else.
- Definitely that, but our part, no.

328
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:19,558
All right, I'm gonna
set up the meet with Kadjic.

329
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:23,131
I said I knew where the weapons were.
I don't know if Kadjic's gonna be there.

330
00:21:23,256 --> 00:21:26,219
Well, then, we're gonna have
to lure Kadjic to the weapons.

331
00:21:26,344 --> 00:21:29,930
I mean, the whole plan depends on our
ability to confirm Kadjic

332
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:33,040
and the weapons being in the same place
at the same time.

333
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:35,042
Everybody ready?

334
00:21:37,227 --> 00:21:39,598
Yeah. But remember,
once you're on that ship,

335
00:21:39,723 --> 00:21:41,736
all that metal's gonna
mess with reception.

336
00:21:41,861 --> 00:21:44,413
I won't be able to reach you
once you're below decks.

337
00:21:44,538 --> 00:21:46,038
Okay, we're all set.

338
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:48,681
<i>How do you know which one?</i>

339
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,169
Liberian registry, italian ship.

340
00:21:51,945 --> 00:21:54,045
- Bonanno's italian.
- Exactly,

341
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,323
il falcone maltese.

342
00:22:03,007 --> 00:22:05,692
- I'm sorry, you can't go through here.
- Where are you going?

343
00:22:05,817 --> 00:22:08,682
I'm just taking my sister to the
insurance company on the 10th floor.

344
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:12,287
- All right, right through there.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

345
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,527
Ding, dong, we're home.

346
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:23,131
Don't move!

347
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,600
Yeah, over here.

348
00:22:24,772 --> 00:22:25,772
Hold it!

349
00:22:25,897 --> 00:22:27,647
Stay right where you are.

350
00:22:33,762 --> 00:22:37,766
Okay, okay, why don't you tell Tony
Kadjic that the guy he sold to the feds

351
00:22:38,314 --> 00:22:40,814
Is here to have a
little chat with him?

352
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:49,955
What are you doing?

353
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,849
Counting all the guys with guns.

354
00:22:51,974 --> 00:22:52,974
How many?

355
00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:54,164
A lot.

356
00:23:01,378 --> 00:23:04,208
So, no chance of just going in
and trusting the fake I.D.'s?

357
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:06,897
Don't worry. No one's ever died
going in through an air duct.

358
00:23:07,022 --> 00:23:08,188
That's comforting.

359
00:23:08,313 --> 00:23:11,463
In worst case, you slip and fall,
break your legs...

360
00:23:11,994 --> 00:23:15,338
Lay there for days,
scratching on the metal.

361
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:19,148
It's like a long metal
coffin... with wind.

362
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:23,119
Let's go.

363
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:41,867
Now, you said you'd call Kadjic
if we asked nicely.

364
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:44,361
That's just what you're going to do.

365
00:23:44,486 --> 00:23:48,142
But when you call, I need you
to be scared for your life.

366
00:23:48,267 --> 00:23:49,967
Can you be scared, boyo?

367
00:23:50,146 --> 00:23:54,098
Yes, I could... I could. I could
be scared. I could be scared.

368
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,070
Thank you very much. I will be with
you momentarily. Please, after you.

369
00:23:57,195 --> 00:23:58,795
Follow this gentleman.

370
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,449
Look, man. We got Kadjic, all right?
Let's just call...

371
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,692
No, not enough.
We need Kadjic and the guns.

372
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,208
Well, mr. Gitt.

373
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,683
You know my name.

374
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,946
I think we're past
pretending otherwise?

375
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:13,701
What is this for?

376
00:24:14,067 --> 00:24:15,203
It's an apology.

377
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:17,997
- What for?
- For what's about to happen.

378
00:24:18,587 --> 00:24:19,687
Call Kadjic.

379
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:30,295
Hello?

380
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,028
Do whatever they say, please.

381
00:24:35,153 --> 00:24:38,472
They killed my FBI handlers.
They murdered them!

382
00:24:38,597 --> 00:24:40,375
<i>And they cut them into pieces</i>

383
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,980
and put them in a bathtub
into a hotel bathtub!

384
00:24:45,466 --> 00:24:46,401
Is this true?

385
00:24:46,744 --> 00:24:48,490
To be fair,
he did most of the cutting.

386
00:24:48,615 --> 00:24:50,696
- Thank you. I appreciate that.
- You work hard.

387
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,541
That's what we do to
people who lie to us.

388
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:05,837
You just killed my partner.

389
00:25:06,412 --> 00:25:07,672
You need new partners.

390
00:25:13,302 --> 00:25:14,104
God!

391
00:25:23,337 --> 00:25:25,776
You're lucky. I was
going to leave tonight.

392
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:29,303
Some of my buyers insist on
seeing my goods in person.

393
00:25:30,605 --> 00:25:31,855
Still counting?

394
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:33,449
I'm still counting.

395
00:25:40,476 --> 00:25:42,526
All right, Hardison, you're in.

396
00:25:42,702 --> 00:25:44,833
Transferring the files
and wiping the originals.

397
00:25:47,221 --> 00:25:48,921
<i>And it looks like each case</i>

398
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,922
Has an evidence box
associated with it.

399
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:15,156
All right, man. Make the call.

400
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:22,455
All right, we got
to get you topside.

401
00:26:23,724 --> 00:26:25,824
- Just a moment, please.
- Yes.

402
00:26:28,466 --> 00:26:30,463
Listen, can we speak in private?

403
00:26:30,961 --> 00:26:31,961
Of course.

404
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:36,286
Gentlemen, it's okay. Thank you.
Go look ter the buyers.

405
00:26:38,402 --> 00:26:40,677
So, you know, you had a
good run with the mayor,

406
00:26:40,802 --> 00:26:42,808
but he was too small for you.

407
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,685
You know, the work I do with
the ball parks and the malls...

408
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:48,705
- That's where the action is.
- Money laundering?

409
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,574
You know, that's
it's a very small word.

410
00:26:52,601 --> 00:26:53,913
I... listen.

411
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:57,662
Do you have any idea how
much dirty money you can hide

412
00:26:57,787 --> 00:27:01,787
in a $30-million
government-financed boondoggle?

413
00:27:06,026 --> 00:27:08,084
I don't just clean your money.
I put it to work,

414
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:11,689
In the land deals, in the construction,
in the concessions and everything.

415
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:15,193
Wherever there's a buck to be made,
I squeeze a quarter out of the take.

416
00:27:15,318 --> 00:27:17,869
You know, most guys, you give them
dirty money and everything,

417
00:27:17,994 --> 00:27:19,835
they give you back, hey, some of it.

418
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,900
But you give me dirty money,
I give it back to you clean.

419
00:27:23,025 --> 00:27:26,403
- All of it?
- Of course, all of it, yeah, plus...

420
00:27:27,972 --> 00:27:30,939
A bonus 10% on the top

421
00:27:31,064 --> 00:27:33,164
for letting me use it on my end.

422
00:27:39,281 --> 00:27:41,074
<i>Case number 1435.</i>

423
00:27:43,058 --> 00:27:45,108
- Can I help you?
- Case 1435.

424
00:27:48,235 --> 00:27:49,667
That's box K-46.

425
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,587
Nobody's allowed to take
anything from that case.

426
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,694
You need the approval of
your field officer... Nevins.

427
00:27:55,819 --> 00:27:59,036
I'm not taking anything out. I'm
entering evidence in. Here's my form.

428
00:28:01,124 --> 00:28:03,596
That's different.
Paperwork and everything?

429
00:28:06,908 --> 00:28:09,061
You know, you could tell
Nevins when you see her

430
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:12,023
She's owed me 20 bucks
for so long, it's...

431
00:28:16,878 --> 00:28:19,904
Why stay and talk to the evidence guy?
What's he got to say?

432
00:28:22,316 --> 00:28:24,765
That's why I was so upset
when you kicked me over to the feds.

433
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,847
You should be using me.

434
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:29,465
You understand we have to
be careful now, you know?

435
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,418
We have interpol. We've had the local
state police, everything.

436
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:35,824
- How'd you deal with it?
- Well, you know, Interpol...

437
00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:37,506
The FBI keeps them off our backs.

438
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,468
Or at least they did,
until you got rid of their informant.

439
00:28:41,027 --> 00:28:44,429
And the state police, well,
I had handled myself.

440
00:28:47,024 --> 00:28:48,567
<i>Match identified.</i>

441
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:51,492
Damn, you finally found
something, half-pint.

442
00:28:52,562 --> 00:28:54,926
<i>Security photo taken</i>

443
00:28:55,051 --> 00:28:57,511
<i>6:30 A.M. Today.</i>

444
00:28:59,401 --> 00:29:01,778
Answer me, Parker, please.
Answer me.

445
00:29:02,389 --> 00:29:03,209
Damn.

446
00:29:13,808 --> 00:29:15,002
Call Kadjic!

447
00:29:16,911 --> 00:29:18,506
<i>Parker, where are you?</i>

448
00:29:19,164 --> 00:29:22,434
Sorry, had a buzz from the alarm system.
I couldn't hear a th...

449
00:29:24,037 --> 00:29:24,855
What?

450
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,312
Parke, what's wrong?

451
00:29:39,114 --> 00:29:40,236
Excuse me a second.

452
00:29:41,216 --> 00:29:42,017
Hello?

453
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,740
I'm sorry. I can't hear.
Who is this? Who?

454
00:29:55,332 --> 00:29:57,336
Find the other one.
Find the other one.

455
00:29:58,562 --> 00:29:59,797
Find him right away.

456
00:30:02,857 --> 00:30:05,469
Bridge.
Take us out past the 12-mile mark.

457
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,430
We have to dump a few things.

458
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,446
I have him.

459
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,866
- What do we do with this one?
- You just kill him.

460
00:30:36,265 --> 00:30:39,670
Now I guess I will show you how
I deal with people who lie to me.

461
00:30:45,729 --> 00:30:46,947
You're really strong.

462
00:30:47,072 --> 00:30:49,166
I hang from buildings
with my fingertips.

463
00:30:49,291 --> 00:30:51,307
It's not what you think.
I was setting up a meeting.

464
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,811
Actually, that was exactly
what I was thinking.

465
00:30:54,496 --> 00:30:55,311
Bye, now.

466
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,687
Not for myself.

467
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,094
No, Tony,
this won't do at all, will it?

468
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,612
Miss Kroy, this

469
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,699
is of no concern to you.
Thank you.

470
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:08,514
Well, it is my concern.

471
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,400
You really think I'm gonna do
business with someone who starts

472
00:31:11,525 --> 00:31:13,800
blasting away in the middle
of a meeting, do you?

473
00:31:14,384 --> 00:31:16,386
You don't even know
who this bloke works for.

474
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:18,876
I don't have a problem with
you taking care of this.

475
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:19,852
Just...

476
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:22,801
just wait till me
and the other buyers are off the ship

477
00:31:22,926 --> 00:31:24,826
before you start getting messy

478
00:31:25,164 --> 00:31:27,072
I don't want to be charged as an

479
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:28,385
accessory.

480
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,023
<i>There's something
wrong with the engines.</i>

481
00:31:43,045 --> 00:31:44,048
Lock him up.

482
00:31:44,637 --> 00:31:46,557
Take him away. Lock him up now!

483
00:31:47,388 --> 00:31:48,805
Hurry! Get out of here!

484
00:31:49,812 --> 00:31:51,555
Come on, move, move.

485
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:53,702
Miss Kroy,

486
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:55,336
I apologize.

487
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:57,998
Glad we understand each other.

488
00:32:01,193 --> 00:32:02,411
I'll get the hatch.

489
00:32:09,114 --> 00:32:10,063
Come on.

490
00:32:11,713 --> 00:32:12,513
13.

491
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:14,336
Move it.

492
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:24,653
Come here.

493
00:32:24,857 --> 00:32:25,657
12.

494
00:32:27,797 --> 00:32:28,597
11.

495
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,226
10.

496
00:32:53,731 --> 00:32:56,307
All she asked was that I report
back to her every now and then.

497
00:32:56,611 --> 00:32:58,350
Are we sure this is the fastest way?

498
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,268
Look. There's no traffic this way.

499
00:33:02,135 --> 00:33:03,355
You were spying on us.

500
00:33:04,055 --> 00:33:05,691
I was not spying.
I was...

501
00:33:06,102 --> 00:33:07,401
An early warning system.

502
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,654
Sophie just... she was worried
Nate might go off the rails.

503
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,641
If it ever looked like he was spinning
out of control, I was supposed to call

504
00:33:13,766 --> 00:33:15,935
and let Sophie lay in a backup plan,
Just in case.

505
00:33:16,158 --> 00:33:17,528
But why not us?

506
00:33:17,653 --> 00:33:19,552
'cause you were too
likely to forgive him.

507
00:33:21,112 --> 00:33:24,190
I suppose getting busted by the FBI
and trying to bring down arms dealers

508
00:33:24,315 --> 00:33:27,129
while kidnapping a mayor
does qualify as out of control.

509
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:30,049
I used my contacts to get Sophie
set up as a buyer for the guns.

510
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:31,943
You know,

511
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:35,408
you actually had me worried for
a second that you were gonna drop me.

512
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,058
That is silly.

513
00:33:45,241 --> 00:33:46,891
Just get us out of this harbor.

514
00:33:47,016 --> 00:33:47,957
I can't.

515
00:33:48,425 --> 00:33:51,612
Someone sabotaged All
the electronics in the engine system.

516
00:33:52,066 --> 00:33:53,572
What the hell is going on here?

517
00:34:03,545 --> 00:34:05,582
- It took you long enough.
- What?

518
00:34:06,987 --> 00:34:07,865
Freeze

519
00:34:12,369 --> 00:34:13,172
One.

520
00:34:13,581 --> 00:34:14,389
What?

521
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:16,052
Where's Nate?

522
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:19,084
I don't know, man. All this
metal is messing with the signal.

523
00:34:26,538 --> 00:34:28,881
Took you long enough. Come on.

524
00:34:54,707 --> 00:34:55,509
Zero.

525
00:35:21,063 --> 00:35:22,202
You came back.

526
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,447
Well...

527
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:27,416
You needed me.

528
00:35:28,821 --> 00:35:29,626
Come on.

529
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:31,920
Can't leave a job half-finished.

530
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,504
I don't want any excuses, okay?

531
00:35:42,778 --> 00:35:43,656
Please.

532
00:35:44,614 --> 00:35:45,703
Oh, thank god.

533
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:47,311
What you doing here?

534
00:35:48,056 --> 00:35:49,145
I don't know.

535
00:35:52,856 --> 00:35:53,662
What?

536
00:35:53,955 --> 00:35:55,395
What are you doing to me?

537
00:35:58,615 --> 00:35:59,655
Oh, my god.

538
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,536
Good. Come on. Let's go.

539
00:36:09,739 --> 00:36:11,794
You chose the wrong man, my friend!

540
00:36:26,287 --> 00:36:27,528
Parker touching.

541
00:36:27,913 --> 00:36:28,977
Kind of, yeah.

542
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,730
I hate to cut goodbyes short,
but they're playing my song.

543
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,107
Keep out of trouble.

544
00:36:33,742 --> 00:36:35,692
Or if you want to get
in trouble again...

545
00:36:36,972 --> 00:36:37,839
So we're...

546
00:36:37,964 --> 00:36:39,805
We're even, absolutely.

547
00:36:44,043 --> 00:36:45,494
You be all right on your own?

548
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:47,079
What do you think?

549
00:36:55,998 --> 00:36:57,789
There's not that many
ways out of here.

550
00:36:57,914 --> 00:37:00,217
Eliot, when I arrange a rescue,

551
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:01,746
I do it properly.

552
00:37:37,165 --> 00:37:38,464
Nobody move!

553
00:37:43,592 --> 00:37:45,138
Where is Tony Kadjic?

554
00:37:46,482 --> 00:37:47,899
He's locked in the bridge,

555
00:37:48,024 --> 00:37:50,287
and the guns are stored
in boxes in the hold.

556
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:53,604
I'm glad to see you kept
your end of the deal, mate.

557
00:38:04,183 --> 00:38:05,240
We have a deal.

558
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,825
Nate, what are you doing?

559
00:38:08,155 --> 00:38:09,369
Stop messing around.

560
00:38:10,508 --> 00:38:12,789
30 seconds, there'll be
another dozen guns on the deck.

561
00:38:13,383 --> 00:38:15,459
You have any idea
what's going on right now, Sterling?

562
00:38:16,326 --> 00:38:18,378
There's a fire
in the FBI evidence room.

563
00:38:27,497 --> 00:38:30,072
And Hardison wiped
the servers of all the evidence.

564
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:33,810
- Where are you going with this?
- I've destroyed all the evidence

565
00:38:34,076 --> 00:38:35,896
The FBI has on Culpepper and Kadjic.

566
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:38,523
You have no photos, no tapes.

567
00:38:38,793 --> 00:38:41,333
You don't have anything.
You don't have a case on anybody...

568
00:38:42,996 --> 00:38:44,576
Unless you arrest me...

569
00:38:45,254 --> 00:38:46,331
And only me.

570
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:48,474
I agree

571
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:50,410
to turn state's evidence.

572
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,830
And I testify to what Kadjic told me,
How he put the hit on Bonanno.

573
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,550
I'll even give you Bonanno's
evidence against the gunrunning.

574
00:38:59,026 --> 00:39:00,326
I can take these guys.

575
00:39:01,111 --> 00:39:03,066
It's just 10 more yards
to the chopper, man.

576
00:39:03,191 --> 00:39:05,477
Listen, guys,
I got you into this mess.

577
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:08,136
This is the only way to get you out.

578
00:39:08,427 --> 00:39:11,810
And I can feel you thinking,
Sterling, and don't... don't bother.

579
00:39:13,063 --> 00:39:14,830
And if you touch one of them,

580
00:39:15,392 --> 00:39:16,622
the deal is off.

581
00:39:17,498 --> 00:39:19,394
Nevins loses two years of work,

582
00:39:19,898 --> 00:39:21,759
And your first case with interpol...

583
00:39:23,867 --> 00:39:25,862
you're my case, or I have no case.

584
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,447
Exactly.

585
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:32,388
- We'll call it a draw, then.
- No, we do not take this deal.

586
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,455
Take one more step,
I'll shoot you myself.

587
00:39:37,164 --> 00:39:39,470
All teams, move in.
Target is in custody.

588
00:39:39,703 --> 00:39:41,049
All teams, move in.

589
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:42,595
Come here.

590
00:39:48,672 --> 00:39:51,927
You guys are the most honorable
people I have ever met

591
00:39:52,161 --> 00:39:53,056
in my life.

592
00:39:54,198 --> 00:39:56,852
You've become my family,
my only family.

593
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,058
I won't forget that.

594
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,608
Now get them on the chopper, please.

595
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:06,695
Now!

596
00:40:07,627 --> 00:40:08,598
Let's go.

597
00:40:12,356 --> 00:40:13,480
Let's go, man.

598
00:40:25,296 --> 00:40:26,128
What?

599
00:40:28,715 --> 00:40:29,660
Come here.

600
00:40:45,366 --> 00:40:46,420
You call me,

601
00:40:47,532 --> 00:40:49,089
You tell me you need me,

602
00:40:49,852 --> 00:40:51,448
so you can do this?

603
00:40:59,518 --> 00:41:01,124
Watch your back, Sterling.

604
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,299
Where is our aerial support?

605
00:41:09,804 --> 00:41:10,846
He's bleeding.

606
00:41:11,209 --> 00:41:12,743
Get an ambulance here.

607
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,566
Who the hell is this guy?

608
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:29,903
I don't know.

609
00:41:31,043 --> 00:41:32,425
My name's Nate Ford.

610
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,217
And I am a thief.
