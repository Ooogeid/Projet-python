00:00:37,357 --> 00:00:39,413
- Hello, Judge Roy.
- Hi, my heart.

3
00:00:47,498 --> 00:00:49,373
Can I help you, your honor?

4
00:00:49,498 --> 00:00:51,470
Yes, Fred. His phone number?

5
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:53,066
This is Frank.

6
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:55,596
And has 19 years, sir.

7
00:00:56,562 --> 00:00:59,148
Damage.
It would have a younger sister?

8
00:01:06,773 --> 00:01:08,257
'm It, great tan.

9
00:01:17,482 --> 00:01:20,794
- If you need something ...
- We will call your boss.

10
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:22,982
Now out of my sight.

11
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:28,568
The trick in a small village,

12
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:30,346
is to be the master.

13
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:38,769
There is a bit more than expected.

14
00:01:38,894 --> 00:01:40,391
It does not bother you?

15
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:41,847
No. But more money,

16
00:01:41,972 --> 00:01:44,725
it is more likely.
I will have to revise my prices.

17
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:46,550
I think about 20%.

18
00:01:47,795 --> 00:01:48,605
15% ...

19
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,485
and I do
will not stop for extortion.

20
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:54,478
You know what they say.

21
00:01:54,603 --> 00:01:56,920
Laundering,
is not a clean job.

22
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,324
No. It's finished.

23
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,496
We need to talk to Nate.

24
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:19,099
More scams.
It takes too long.

25
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:21,317
Hence the name.
We must convince the pigeon

26
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:23,321
it is a case
before the scam.

27
00:02:23,446 --> 00:02:26,337
Two weeks.
To sleep in seedy hotels,

28
00:02:26,462 --> 00:02:28,199
to eat meals dégueu,

29
00:02:28,324 --> 00:02:30,149
to burn here.

30
00:02:30,649 --> 00:02:32,154
It is over 40 °.

31
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,193
Who can live where it is 40 °?

32
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:37,148
Juan is not so bad.

33
00:02:37,546 --> 00:02:38,991
I love this place.

34
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:43,454
I had to redirect two satellites,
just to be able

35
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:44,669
connect.

36
00:02:44,794 --> 00:02:47,583
More than an hour just to
download Doctor who. "

37
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:50,096
The illegal downloading,
is wrong.

38
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:02,056
What is cleaning?

39
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,281
False addresses are closed.

40
00:03:04,406 --> 00:03:06,440
Mailboxes as well.

41
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:08,176
The phones are cut off.

42
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:10,856
Another five minutes,
and it has never existed.

43
00:03:11,704 --> 00:03:14,068
I call Delgado
to announce the news?

44
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:18,298
As soon as I got out of the county,
I call them.

45
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:23,369
But I'd like you do
more than this rotten ruin.

46
00:04:00,638 --> 00:04:02,241
A problem?

47
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:07,635
We have to sort by.

48
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,888
This is was
doing.

49
00:04:15,945 --> 00:04:17,516
What awaits?

50
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:40,517
Sir, please
you off the counter.

51
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,156
- Why?
- Move.

52
00:04:42,592 --> 00:04:43,616
Hands up!

53
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:44,932
Calm down.

54
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,852
Drop your weapon!

55
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:51,038
This is a robbery.

56
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:54,460
I want to hurt anyone, but
we will do if you n'obeissant pas.

57
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,289
Stay away from the door,
now!

58
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,466
- It's a joke.
- Damn.

59
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,718
It was too easy!

60
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,011
Shut the door!

61
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:05,528
Lock it.

62
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,265
Both of you, lie down in sight.

63
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,684
Go!
On the other side of the counter.

64
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,478
Everyone on earth!

65
00:05:13,442 --> 00:05:16,202
Empty all drawers.
Put everything in there.

66
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:23,865
Remove. Now.

67
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,449
We talking about?

68
00:05:26,027 --> 00:05:28,845
A van with no plates in front
a bank that is pointing?

69
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,225
He speaks well.

70
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,456
A few steps more
and it was outside.

71
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:35,250
- He was thinking of what, hell?
- Do not be silly.

72
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:36,369
What?

73
00:05:36,884 --> 00:05:38,295
Sophie was still there.

74
00:05:46,103 --> 00:05:48,689
It is not enough ... far from it.

75
00:05:48,814 --> 00:05:51,633
There was no time.
What will we do?

76
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:57,773
- Open the trunk.
- I can not.

77
00:05:57,898 --> 00:06:00,654
You can not open
at certain times.

78
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:02,504
Nobody here can not open it?

79
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,405
No, I do not think so.

80
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,074
The manager may have the codes.

81
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,012
- Shit.
- I'm sorry.

82
00:06:12,702 --> 00:06:14,240
Empty your pockets.

83
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:17,596
Wallets, bags, watches ...
start all over here.

84
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:35,319
They responded quickly enough.

85
00:06:35,444 --> 00:06:37,790
Someone had to start
the silent alarm.

86
00:06:37,915 --> 00:06:39,424
It's really not good.

87
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,487
- It does not know anything.
- It may be enough.

88
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:44,486
They know not what they do.

89
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:50,146
I should try to reason.

90
00:06:50,682 --> 00:06:53,078
What a good idea,
for us to shoot!

91
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,672
I have before me killers
every day in court.

92
00:06:56,797 --> 00:06:58,521
These two are not.

93
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,921
Yeah ... you may be right.

94
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:05,799
Right there, and we need ...

95
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,476
You must back, sir.

96
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:10,689
- Tell me what happens.
- Impossible

97
00:07:10,814 --> 00:07:13,682
- A robbery was under way, and ...
- I am speaking to you.

98
00:07:15,617 --> 00:07:17,561
<i> - How are they?
- You're right. </ I>

99
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:20,564
Amateurs, really, those two.

100
00:07:20,963 --> 00:07:24,693
The youngest, it seems
he never held a weapon.

101
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,988
<i> - The judge Craignos is next to you?
- Yeah. </ I>

102
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,485
No doubt fans.
That makes them dangerous.

103
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,412
<i> 2 guys, </ i>

105

I go?

106
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:40,542
You can not enter.
The situation is delicate.

107
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,395
It is better to wait

108
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,172
and see what these two
have in mind, right?

109
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:47,043
You are the leader.

110
00:07:49,047 --> 00:07:50,047
Thank you.

111
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,493
- It is almost 17 h.
- I know.

112
00:07:52,618 --> 00:07:54,447
Will count the money, everything will be fine.

113
00:07:54,572 --> 00:07:55,826
Remains calm.

114
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,783
What are you doing? Ground.

115
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:05,353
You know who I am?

116
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:06,872
I do not care.

117
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:08,278
You should.

118
00:08:08,605 --> 00:08:11,323
I can arrange
this whole situation.

119
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,452
Simply
to cross that door.

120
00:08:16,268 --> 00:08:19,457
- Is that all?
- Because I am the law here.

121
00:08:20,874 --> 00:08:24,314
The guy with the badge outside,
is Bill.

122
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:26,213
It works for me.

123
00:08:26,804 --> 00:08:27,999
A phone call,

124
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:31,301
he and his guys leave
as they came.

125
00:08:32,075 --> 00:08:33,810
Let me say two words.

126
00:08:35,126 --> 00:08:36,429
Stay where you are.

127
00:08:37,003 --> 00:08:38,016
How are you?

128
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,472
To wonder.

129
00:08:40,718 --> 00:08:41,972
And you?

130
00:08:42,097 --> 00:08:44,496
There's something weird.

131
00:08:45,173 --> 00:08:46,618
You noticed too?

132
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:48,652
The guy said
they did not have enough.

133
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,277
They need more cash,
and not for rent.

134
00:08:51,402 --> 00:08:52,531
I <i> sheet. </ i>

135
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:55,075
We must find
the way out of here.

136

They get what they want,

137
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,882
and we can get
everyone in the quiet.

138
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:04,501
I do not know about you,
but I will not put my life

139
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:08,644
in the hands of the assault
Amateur Juan.

140
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:13,340
What is the plan, Stan?

141
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:15,319
The truth ...

142
00:09:16,103 --> 00:09:18,277
the truth is what I say.

143
00:09:19,196 --> 00:09:21,909
Regardless of the history
j'inventerai that,

144
00:09:23,325 --> 00:09:25,272
these brave people
to tell the cops.

145
00:09:27,743 --> 00:09:28,930
Yes, son.

146
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,662
This is how it happens here.

147
00:09:33,376 --> 00:09:34,740
All that you have to do,

148
00:09:35,382 --> 00:09:37,142
it is clear that door.

149
00:09:38,722 --> 00:09:40,075
Simple as that.

150
00:09:42,746 --> 00:09:43,582
Thank you.

151
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:47,465
I have enough experience to know
it is never

152
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:49,549
as easy as it sounds.

153
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,006
Then pose your ass

154
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,606
the ground!

155
00:10:00,462 --> 00:10:03,227
We can not let the local cops

156
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,418
<i> manage the situation. </ i>

157
00:10:05,712 --> 00:10:07,272
We must take control.

158
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,034
We must be the police.

159
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:15,322
How it happened
for you, Judge?

160
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,307
Beautiful car.

161
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:31,054
This is annoying.

162
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:34,424
It is not a bank braque
without an exit strategy.

163
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,720
These two deserve
getting caught.

164
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,196
42 seconds.

165
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:39,154
What?

166
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:41,118
Pointing to the bank.

167
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:43,884
A guard who has never
used his gun before,

168
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:45,936
2 cameras outside, 1 inside,

169
00:10:46,114 --> 00:10:48,125
1 and 50 years of safe,

170
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,127
the combination of which is the date of
birth of the wife of the manager.

171
00:10:51,252 --> 00:10:52,734
Entry, exit, 42 seconds.

172
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:54,088
Seriously?

173
00:10:59,227 --> 00:11:01,203
Agent Leonard. Here is the official Elmore.

174
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,912
It supports
this case, Sheriff ...

175
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,016
Bill Hastings. Nice to meet you.

176
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:10,168
You're fast.
I called there 20 minutes.

177
00:11:10,352 --> 00:11:13,158
On returning from a small
territorial skirmish.

178
00:11:13,283 --> 00:11:15,799
A patrol was attacked
by xmagnun.

179
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,280
Xmagnun of?

180
00:11:17,714 --> 00:11:20,258
I thought
it was an urban legend.

181
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:22,343
You are nice ...

182
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:26,478
- It was what, Sheriff?
- It is not really inside,

183
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,592
therefore it is unclear
the number of robbers,

184
00:11:28,717 --> 00:11:31,699
or hostages, and what they want.

185
00:11:34,263 --> 00:11:35,902
And your intervention?

186
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,016
There was no intervention group,

187
00:11:38,141 --> 00:11:41,345
Virgil but up there,
is quite a sniper.

188
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,647
Very good.

189
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,739
We must ensure that our below
table remain under the table.

190
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,380
If the feds find,
we're screwed.

191
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,868
There is still limited.

192
00:11:56,993 --> 00:11:59,065
You must enter
in-room safes.

193
00:12:00,476 --> 00:12:02,040
Where is the director?

194
00:12:02,662 --> 00:12:04,473
Sir ...

195
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:08,226
I am the director of the agency.

196
00:12:08,696 --> 00:12:12,513
- What ...
- If she wants to hang himself, let there.

197
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,665
I should be able ...

198
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,693
override the timer.

199
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:20,625
I can try if you want.

200
00:12:28,185 --> 00:12:30,243
What will they do?

201
00:12:30,368 --> 00:12:31,651
Good question.

202
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:34,562
I have never seen robbers try

203
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,172
inflate their booty
once surrounded the bank.

204
00:12:37,563 --> 00:12:40,092
In general,
they seek a way out.

205
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,618
This would help ...

206
00:12:42,088 --> 00:12:44,124
You listen? This would help,

207
00:12:44,482 --> 00:12:46,794
this would be news
on these people,

208
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:49,217
Learn how to negotiate
with them,

209
00:12:49,342 --> 00:12:50,477
here and now.

210
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:51,937
<i> It is already over. </ i>

211
00:12:52,214 --> 00:12:54,167
I hacked the security system.

212
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:56,289
I can see the robber.

213
00:12:56,414 --> 00:12:58,652
I look in the
basis for identifying facial

214
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:00,972
linked to the NSA and the FBI.

215
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:04,241
If these types are known,
sooner rather quickly.

216
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:06,450
It was fast.

217
00:13:07,213 --> 00:13:09,192
These guys should be sought.

218
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:12,040
Mistake.

219
00:13:12,432 --> 00:13:14,526
The oldest is a soldier.

220
00:13:14,857 --> 00:13:17,629
Derrick Clark. Officer in the Navy
for 20 years.

221
00:13:18,407 --> 00:13:19,756
Retired recently.

222
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,598
It does not ...

223
00:13:21,723 --> 00:13:22,989
It does not make any sense.

224
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:26,096
Why this type
braquerait it a bank?

225
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,098
I go to his accounts.

226
00:13:29,263 --> 00:13:31,642
Derrick emptied
all accounts this morning,

227
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:33,158
he distributors

228
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:35,105
ceiling until withdrawal

229
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,433
<i> - his credit cards.
- Who withdrew </ i>

230
00:13:37,558 --> 00:13:41,153
all his money in the bank,
and returned to fly?

231
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,779
You say?

232
00:13:43,128 --> 00:13:43,945
What?

233
00:13:44,635 --> 00:13:46,701
No, nothing,

234
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,203
I thought,

235
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,625
if the police were smart,
they identify

236
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,067
these types,

237
00:13:54,456 --> 00:13:58,295
try to understand who they are,
and meet their families.

238
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,375
I have anticipated.

239
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:05,010
Hardison me past the address.
I'm already on the way.

240
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:17,856
Devil!

241
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:20,442
It will become dangerous here!

242
00:14:20,714 --> 00:14:22,110
What will happen?

243
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,774
What will happen?

244
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,657
Cutting the course of the bank.
Standard procedure.

245
00:14:28,032 --> 00:14:30,440
Standard ... is standard?

246
00:14:30,565 --> 00:14:32,578
Where do you keep this nonsense?

247
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,944
Member of Arnold.

248
00:14:34,352 --> 00:14:37,436
He organized a seminar on
crisis management last year.

249
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,650
An online seminar.

250
00:14:40,939 --> 00:14:42,339
We had the certificates.

251
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:45,277
Certificates?

252
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:47,485
There are kits in magic.

253
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,013
So the kids like to see
their parents cut into 2?

254
00:14:50,427 --> 00:14:51,848
We just read the manual.

255
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:55,540
The manual?

256
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,819
The manual did kill a man.

257
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:02,150
I can not ...
my blood pressure.

258
00:15:04,762 --> 00:15:05,939
Her ex-partner.

259
00:15:06,064 --> 00:15:08,198
You should not
talk of the manual.

260
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:11,868
Neither propellers.

261
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:20,669
Why do this?

262
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,781
We must absolutely money.

263
00:15:22,906 --> 00:15:25,173
Why?
Your son has problems?

264
00:15:27,138 --> 00:15:28,301
This is your son?

265
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:32,674
- This is not your business.
- You point a gun at me

266
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,130
then I think so.

267
00:15:34,255 --> 00:15:36,226
You do not have the combination?

268
00:15:36,964 --> 00:15:39,198
Are you only the director?

269
00:15:40,825 --> 00:15:41,856
Not really.

270
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:47,045
Derrick listen. Simple as that.
I just want to help you,

271
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,752
you and your son.

272
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:50,530
You know my name?

273
00:15:50,655 --> 00:15:53,415
I know more.
Whether you want to hurt anyone.

274
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,155
What you have to do that.

275
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,290
So, help me to understand.

276
00:15:58,855 --> 00:16:00,476
What does the money go?

277
00:16:09,026 --> 00:16:12,840
No, I'm working.
It will be good. In full.

278
00:16:14,372 --> 00:16:15,980
But, please ...

279
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,560
does not do anything.

280
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,275
<i> The entrance door was forced. </ i>

281
00:16:34,113 --> 00:16:36,181
Someone was there
when it happened.

282
00:16:42,412 --> 00:16:43,543
His name is Michael.

283
00:16:43,818 --> 00:16:46,116
<i> I found his ballot
school land. </ i>

284
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,094
What do you do?

285
00:16:53,372 --> 00:16:55,305
- Rallongez you.
- It's not too late,

286
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:57,008
Michael.

287
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:01,464
That's true.
You can still save.

288
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:05,065
You know who holds it?

289
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,328
Everything is my fault.

290
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,222
They did.

291
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,932
They think that's me.

292
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,040
The word that they want

293
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:24,411
100 000 $ 17 h. ..

294
00:17:26,863 --> 00:17:27,921
or they kill.

295
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:31,548
We will not allow to happen.

296
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:36,392
But you have to trust me,
and how, exactly,

297
00:17:36,553 --> 00:17:38,121
what I say.

298
00:17:38,246 --> 00:17:41,374
And I promise you
we will bring your mother.

299
00:17:44,357 --> 00:17:47,702
They made me do
small stuff at the beginning ...

300
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:50,235
races, stuff like that.

301
00:17:51,682 --> 00:17:54,114
Then I started
to work for them.

302
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:55,978
Drugs?

303
00:17:56,412 --> 00:17:57,918
Essentially.

304
00:17:58,416 --> 00:17:59,680
Then ...

305
00:18:00,274 --> 00:18:01,621
I was trapped.

306
00:18:02,668 --> 00:18:04,730
Why are they
after you now?

307
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:07,286
Last week,
they were dubbed.

308
00:18:07,822 --> 00:18:09,815
A full load,

309
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,440
off, and they think ...

310
00:18:12,565 --> 00:18:15,200
is it me,
but I'm there for nothing.

311
00:18:15,325 --> 00:18:18,555
So they came to you,
nothing found

312
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:21,394
then they took
your mother hostage?

313
00:18:21,853 --> 00:18:25,770
I must reduce the load
or pay $ 100 000.

314
00:18:26,055 --> 00:18:28,773
100 000 $!
There was not such a sum.

315
00:18:30,383 --> 00:18:31,890
Everything is my fault.

316
00:18:33,651 --> 00:18:35,336
Everyone farm!

317
00:18:36,995 --> 00:18:38,450
Listen to me.

318
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:44,822
I know that you cross,
and I can help you, if you want.

319
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:48,288
How?

320
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,713
You are trapped here,
just like us.

321
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,676
I have friends on the outside.

322
00:18:57,014 --> 00:18:59,095
No. No cops.

323
00:18:59,618 --> 00:19:01,621
If they find, they kill.

324
00:19:01,746 --> 00:19:03,194
They are not cops. Promised.

325
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:05,134
Trust my friends.

326
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:06,996
Why should I believe you?

327
00:19:07,277 --> 00:19:09,026
I do not know you.

328
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:10,315
I am a thief.

329
00:19:14,231 --> 00:19:15,570
What do I do this!

330
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,849
This type sale there, Judge Roy?

331
00:19:18,142 --> 00:19:20,212
Among others, he received
of bribery

332
00:19:20,337 --> 00:19:22,410
drug dealers and traffickers.

333
00:19:22,752 --> 00:19:26,220
There are 2 months, he released a type
who killed a girl in the area.

334
00:19:27,357 --> 00:19:29,512
Delgado? Beth Delgado.

335
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:32,948
I remember.
She went to school with my son.

336
00:19:33,073 --> 00:19:34,713
Are being scammed the judge.

337
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:38,055
He stole his money
to give to the family.

338
00:19:38,736 --> 00:19:42,597
I have a partner in the
bank, and 3 others outside.

339
00:19:45,387 --> 00:19:47,297
I can not be trusted.

340
00:19:48,475 --> 00:19:50,832
- You are thieves.
- And your only chance.

341
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:53,233
The police identified the site.
You do not leave.

342
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,812
Only my team can settle this.

343
00:19:55,937 --> 00:19:57,935
And how do you do?

344
00:19:59,071 --> 00:20:00,988
The deadline expires in 1 / 2 hours.

345
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:04,786
Your friends have $ 100 000
within reach?

346
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,246
We will use the money we have here.

347
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,920
It is not enough. It lacks 30 000 $.

348
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:13,127
No, Michael, not the money.
It was another source of income.

349
00:20:14,118 --> 00:20:16,025
It suggests what I think?

350
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,431
You suggest what we believe?

351
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,123
Give our money stolen
to other thieves?

352
00:20:21,248 --> 00:20:23,513
<i> Yes, exactly
what I suggest. </ i>

353
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,307
But we'll do that without
our grill cover.

354
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,936
Who are you talking about?

355
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:32,763
I may be blunt, Nate,

356
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:36,197
but your income is
2 steps from "Boss Hogg"

357
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:38,142
in a bank
surrounded by cops.

358
00:20:38,267 --> 00:20:39,529
<i> It is not easy. </ i>

359
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,197
But not impossible, if

360
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,449
has the best thief in the world.

361
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:47,131
Parker, you have already pointed
a bank robbery in progress?

362
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:50,734
There is a 1st time at all.

363
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:54,627
The bank was built
before 1980, before computers.

364
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:56,977
So the door of filing
greater.

365
00:20:57,102 --> 00:21:00,425
Because merchants must
deposit their daily revenues.

366
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,778
You thought my genius
was limited to 1 and 0?

367
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:07,180
I think I can return from there.

368
00:21:07,305 --> 00:21:09,893
But it is in the aisle
on this side of the building.

369
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,936
The cops on the other side you see.

370
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:15,899
I am busy, but
there are more serious problems.

371
00:21:16,171 --> 00:21:19,149
- Which?
- The Sheriff Coltrane called the FBI ...

372
00:21:19,274 --> 00:21:20,528
the real FBI.

373
00:21:20,808 --> 00:21:22,822
<i> nearest office
in San Diego, </ i>

374
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,490
so they will be here,

375
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,338
say 45 minutes.

376
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,435
We care about <i> later. </ i>

377
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:30,163
And when it?

378
00:21:30,449 --> 00:21:31,928
In 45 minutes.

379
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,366
What will happen?

380
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,595
<i> 45 minutes, 45 minutes, </ i>

381
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,215
<i> will be finished by then. </ i>

382
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,813
<i> cake, not worry. </ i>

383
00:21:45,506 --> 00:21:46,872
It is silent!

384
00:21:47,748 --> 00:21:49,265
We do not need help.

385
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,350
Checks!

386
00:21:50,515 --> 00:21:53,328
We talk, you listen.
It works like this.

387
00:21:53,915 --> 00:21:55,321
Stay away from him!

388
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,400
Everyone standing
near the offices.

389
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,063
Go! Here we go!

390
00:22:01,437 --> 00:22:02,675
You heard!

391
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,990
It will be hot!

392
00:22:04,602 --> 00:22:06,032
Thank you for having tried.

393
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:17,669
It sits

394
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,357
and silence!

395
00:22:25,264 --> 00:22:27,913
So we used a wire

396
00:22:29,142 --> 00:22:31,516
- In the 10 kilos ...
- One moment.

397
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,038
Excuse me.

398
00:22:33,163 --> 00:22:34,509
Agent Leonard.

399
00:22:38,854 --> 00:22:41,903
We will do everything necessary.

400
00:22:42,171 --> 00:22:44,279
Please do not hurt anyone,
that's all.

401
00:22:45,684 --> 00:22:46,884
Ok.

402
00:22:47,207 --> 00:22:48,161
Guys ...

403
00:22:49,222 --> 00:22:50,372
gathering.

404
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,663
This was the call.

405
00:22:53,974 --> 00:22:55,544
The appeal was expected.

406
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:57,000
They made a list.

407
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,422
First, they want
12 large pizzas.

408
00:22:59,547 --> 00:23:01,886
A cheese, a Hawaiian,
Extra pineapple.

409
00:23:02,011 --> 00:23:04,651
Two pepperoni and black olives,
two chorizos, d. ..

410
00:23:05,244 --> 00:23:08,095
Nobody writes that?
Seriously?

411
00:23:11,293 --> 00:23:13,349
A triple-vanilla coffee with milk.

412
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,194
Three copies of the latest CD
of Hall and Oates.

413
00:23:25,526 --> 00:23:28,535
Exciting, yes! Moi non plus,
I knew not for the new album.

414
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:33,439
Stay focused.
They want to control the situation.

415
00:23:33,564 --> 00:23:37,165
They need to worry.
I do not know why.

416
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,816
We need a Télécran. Y a
one who likes to scribble in there ...

417
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,881
C'est bon?
Come on, gentlemen.

418
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:48,619
Everyone was moving.
Go, stay there.

419
00:23:48,744 --> 00:23:51,137
Toi tu restes.
Need to talk to Hall & Oates.

420
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:53,174
We must trust them.

421
00:23:54,386 --> 00:23:55,812
They are criminals.

422
00:23:58,189 --> 00:23:59,437
Anyway ...

423
00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:06,293
What you've said?

424
00:24:06,418 --> 00:24:09,906
I tried the old trick.
Divide and conquer.

425
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,366
Convince the kid
them to compete.

426
00:24:12,814 --> 00:24:15,247
I was almost, but ...

427
00:24:26,928 --> 00:24:28,424
There are a lot of money.

428
00:24:29,486 --> 00:24:30,676
Yes, I know.

429
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:34,180
The life of my wife is
of land where the money goes.

430
00:24:36,761 --> 00:24:37,964
I understand.

431
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,439
Sometimes the bad guys are
only kind that remains.

432
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:47,612
Listen,

433
00:24:48,204 --> 00:24:50,262
you have filled in a dirty mess.

434
00:24:50,387 --> 00:24:51,699
Let me help you?

435
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,992
Judge, I think they're serious
saying not to speak.

436
00:24:56,013 --> 00:24:58,454
So we should remain
sat without speaking.

437
00:24:59,358 --> 00:25:00,917
Do what they want.

438
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:02,618
It's better like that.

439
00:25:06,491 --> 00:25:07,547
Listen to me.

440
00:25:08,764 --> 00:25:10,398
You want the money?

441
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:12,218
I.

442
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:14,631
We must find
ground.

443
00:25:14,756 --> 00:25:16,514
That would be a loan, of course.

444
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:25,629
- Where are you?
- I just want to prove my good faith.

445
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:30,971
How much you need?
Because I have that ...

446
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:33,738
What the hell?

447
00:25:34,678 --> 00:25:35,783
Where is my briefcase?

448
00:25:43,157 --> 00:25:44,750
It's them. What do I do?

449
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:47,537
Judge ...

450
00:25:49,822 --> 00:25:50,631
Nate.

451
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,429
Ask your weapon.

452
00:25:59,952 --> 00:26:00,892
You first.

453
00:26:05,217 --> 00:26:06,833
Tell me.

454
00:26:17,082 --> 00:26:18,145
Calm down.

455
00:26:18,656 --> 00:26:20,174
Wait a minute.

456
00:26:21,157 --> 00:26:22,659
There may be injured.

457
00:26:22,784 --> 00:26:24,562
It is not known.
There was a coup.

458
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,683
Look, you go
with weapons fire,

459
00:26:27,808 --> 00:26:30,588
there will be new fire
and people will be injured.

460
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:33,257
We must know what happened.

461
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,510
Please <i> that any
the world is quiet. </ i>

462
00:26:37,046 --> 00:26:38,930
Lower your weapons.

463
00:26:39,328 --> 00:26:40,822
We can discuss.

464
00:26:40,947 --> 00:26:42,708
It is not you who
order, baby.

465
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:44,727
- What is your problem?
- My problem?

466
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:46,229
You are my problem.

467
00:26:47,563 --> 00:26:48,980
You and Nate.

468
00:26:49,105 --> 00:26:51,260
I heard you call Nate.

469
00:26:51,385 --> 00:26:54,570
It's funny,
he told me to call Carl.

470
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:59,242
You were trying to m'arnaquer.

471
00:27:01,074 --> 00:27:02,286
You are in cahoots.

472
00:27:03,082 --> 00:27:04,457
It has nothing to do with them.

473
00:27:06,164 --> 00:27:07,898
I have everything.

474
00:27:08,023 --> 00:27:10,701
You four, you
conspired against me.

475
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:13,798
This setting is not real?

476
00:27:14,151 --> 00:27:16,961
It's just a scam
to take my money!

477
00:27:17,446 --> 00:27:18,886
And it is a good plan.

478
00:27:21,115 --> 00:27:22,360
If this old Carl

479
00:27:23,024 --> 00:27:24,725
disappeared with the money

480
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,649
you knew that I would have
continued and even hunted.

481
00:27:30,202 --> 00:27:32,453
But if money is stolen
during a robbery, 

482
00:27:32,578 --> 00:27:34,819
- You could have you learned.
- Wrong.

483
00:27:35,661 --> 00:27:37,823
They just try to help us.

484
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:41,367
My wife has been removed.
The money is for ransom.

485
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:43,546
A ransom? Really?

486
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,742
Did you not find anything better?

487
00:27:47,138 --> 00:27:50,213
You must be an idiot
to believe such a story!

488
00:27:50,338 --> 00:27:52,088
- It tells you the truth.
- Shut up!

489
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:53,421
Fasten it all!

490
00:27:57,435 --> 00:28:00,707
Drop your weapon or
I get all four.

491
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,545
Please.

492
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,533
He must go to the hospital.

493
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,406
This is not about to happen.

494
00:28:24,968 --> 00:28:26,756
Nobody leaves here ...

495
00:28:27,484 --> 00:28:29,080
before I get my money.

496
00:28:31,973 --> 00:28:34,347
Where's my damn suitcase?

497
00:28:43,358 --> 00:28:44,571
<i> Not here. </ i>

498
00:28:45,486 --> 00:28:47,056
That, I can see it.

499
00:28:47,363 --> 00:28:48,805
No, I mean

500
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:51,145
not in the building.

501
00:28:51,984 --> 00:28:53,439
Come on.

502
00:28:53,861 --> 00:28:55,444
<i> They are not there yet </ i>

503
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:58,147
Drugs are
known for their punctuality.

504
00:28:59,194 --> 00:29:01,108
It landed not in my city

505
00:29:01,847 --> 00:29:04,761
- From thinking with my money.
- A man was injured.

506
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,507
- We must let him go.
- I said, nobody out.

507
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,724
- He's bleeding.
- Shut up!

508
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,409
Everyone! Shut up!

509
00:29:16,001 --> 00:29:17,482
I try to think.

510
00:29:19,117 --> 00:29:21,781
If you are out
the case of the bank,

511
00:29:22,126 --> 00:29:24,968
you have
an accomplice outside.

512
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,557
You tell him how?

513
00:29:30,173 --> 00:29:33,267
And I jumped from the roof with a parachute
on the hood of an armored

514
00:29:33,392 --> 00:29:34,772
and neutralized the guards.

515
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,065
The robbers.

516
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:39,050
Yes, that's what I said.

517
00:29:39,586 --> 00:29:41,310
The shooting was accidental.

518
00:29:41,435 --> 00:29:44,471
There were no injuries,
but one of the hostages was a scratch.

519
00:29:44,596 --> 00:29:46,811
They relax when they have
what they want.

520
00:29:46,936 --> 00:29:48,828
Where are those damned pizza,
elsewhere?

521
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,263
It is not good.

522
00:30:10,164 --> 00:30:11,569
<i> You have your guy </ i>

523
00:30:12,513 --> 00:30:13,853
<i> when I have my money </ i>

524
00:30:20,513 --> 00:30:22,007
It's really not good.

525
00:30:31,443 --> 00:30:32,329
Back.

526
00:30:38,734 --> 00:30:41,304
- This is what I think?
- I'm afraid.

527
00:30:41,865 --> 00:30:44,091
Nate is looking bad way.

528
00:30:44,423 --> 00:30:46,469
Should we <i> retrieves the briefcase. </ i>

529
00:30:51,686 --> 00:30:52,892
I'm working.

530
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,217
Sophie is how?

531
00:31:09,889 --> 00:31:12,289
The ball went through.

532
00:31:13,641 --> 00:31:14,997
It did not hit the artery.

533
00:31:15,594 --> 00:31:17,291
At least that.

534
00:31:19,198 --> 00:31:20,781
It could have been worse.

535
00:31:22,736 --> 00:31:24,523
Worse than me shoot

536
00:31:24,995 --> 00:31:26,693
and reveal who we are?

537
00:31:26,975 --> 00:31:29,436
You're not going to stick
responsible.

538
00:31:29,561 --> 00:31:33,182
It would not be there,
if t'étais out with the money.

539
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:35,102
- I can handle.
- I know.

540
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,884
And take care of myself.

541
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:40,019
I do from a lease,
well before you meet.

542
00:31:40,144 --> 00:31:42,286
- You understand.
- Yes, I understood.

543
00:31:45,479 --> 00:31:46,763
What's the plan?

544
00:31:48,472 --> 00:31:49,365
The plan?

545
00:31:49,787 --> 00:31:53,587
Where I have a hole
3 cm in the shoulder?

546
00:31:53,712 --> 00:31:56,959
The plan?
I swung a long time ago.

547
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:59,367
No matter now.

548
00:31:59,983 --> 00:32:02,447
- We can communicate.
- Yes, it is deaf.

549
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:05,160
- Hardison, Parker, and Eliot ...
- They are all alone.

550
00:32:15,563 --> 00:32:17,392
We did not request it.

551
00:32:17,517 --> 00:32:19,520
This rogue is not
full of surprises?

552
00:32:26,963 --> 00:32:28,737
Where are you going, old owl?

553
00:32:32,457 --> 00:32:34,117
Where do you ...

554
00:32:36,611 --> 00:32:39,206
What stinks and
shouts a girl?

555
00:32:42,565 --> 00:32:43,919
Good answer.

556
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,807
Stay in the car.

557
00:33:21,072 --> 00:33:22,166
Who are you?

558
00:33:23,576 --> 00:33:26,286
That must be the cavalry.

559
00:33:32,415 --> 00:33:33,424
Ready?

560
00:33:36,873 --> 00:33:38,849
A few more minutes.

561
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,275
Hurry up.
The pizzas are there.

562
00:33:49,632 --> 00:33:51,737
Let the ambulance take him.

563
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,614
We remain on.

564
00:33:54,623 --> 00:33:56,439
And abandon my advantage?

565
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:02,940
Listen.

566
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:06,409
Everything will be fine for her.

567
00:34:07,152 --> 00:34:09,171
Everything will be fine.

568
00:34:11,804 --> 00:34:13,029
Your accomplices ...

569
00:34:14,837 --> 00:34:16,037
they are good?

570
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,187
The best.

571
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,986
Everything is my fault.

572
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:34,534
I never had
attend these types.

573
00:34:36,347 --> 00:34:38,032
Finally, if something ...

574
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:39,715
Mom arrives ...

575
00:34:42,868 --> 00:34:43,978
Dad, I'm ...

576
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,085
really sorry.

577
00:34:59,977 --> 00:35:02,770
I'm the FBI agent Leonard.

578
00:35:02,931 --> 00:35:04,522
Here pizza requested.

579
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,139
Nothing was ordered.

580
00:35:07,264 --> 00:35:09,716
Be addressed, Judge.

581
00:35:16,132 --> 00:35:18,465
My old, just open the door.

582
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:20,086
Come on.

583
00:35:41,004 --> 00:35:43,263
I think you expect that.

584
00:35:54,208 --> 00:35:56,825
We can give you something else?

585
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,162
Anything that would help
to unblock the situation?

586
00:35:59,287 --> 00:36:01,264
Wait. I am not ...

587
00:36:01,389 --> 00:36:04,224
Sir, you were given
what you want.

588
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:06,452
If you let the hostages go,

589
00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:08,911
- We can talk about that.
- You will not understand.

590
00:36:09,036 --> 00:36:12,566
- It is these four ...
- Look at me.

591
00:36:12,691 --> 00:36:15,130
I understand.
This seems a situation

592
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,569
- Without hope.
- What are you doing?

593
00:36:17,952 --> 00:36:19,927
But nobody else
may be injured.

594
00:36:20,724 --> 00:36:22,429
You're one of them, right?

595
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,318
- Now!
- Here we go!

596
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,770
- Drop the gun, your honor.
- Bill is not what you think.

597
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,116
Sir, gently drop the weapon.

598
00:36:32,882 --> 00:36:34,650
No. You are wrong!

599
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,060
I'm the hero!

600
00:36:36,185 --> 00:36:38,581
What you doing?
You work for me!

601
00:36:44,596 --> 00:36:47,186
If you need money Roy,
you could ask for a loan.

602
00:36:47,311 --> 00:36:49,498
I did not need a loan,
I have lots of money, but ...

603
00:36:50,951 --> 00:36:51,959
The pizza?

604
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,733
- Where is the box of pizza?
- You understand what he says?

605
00:36:54,858 --> 00:36:56,320
Because it makes no sense.

606
00:36:56,445 --> 00:36:58,406
It's my money!
They have my money back!

607
00:36:58,531 --> 00:37:01,260
- Damn, what are you talking about?
- It was in my suitcase!

608
00:37:04,304 --> 00:37:05,632
This case?

609
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,193
Crystal?

610
00:37:18,496 --> 00:37:20,612
What have you filled, Roy?

611
00:37:21,565 --> 00:37:23,323
It is not for me.

612
00:37:24,697 --> 00:37:26,827
Everything makes sense now.

613
00:37:27,189 --> 00:37:30,209
That would explain the behavior
irrational, nervousness,

614
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,627
and ... irritability.

615
00:37:32,063 --> 00:37:33,834
Shut up.
You're not even the FBI.

616
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:37,374
Paranoid hallucinations,
outbreaks of violence.

617
00:37:37,872 --> 00:37:39,778
Listen to me. It is one of them.

618
00:37:39,903 --> 00:37:41,179
It is complicit.

619
00:37:41,916 --> 00:37:43,471
Complice what? With whom?

620
00:37:43,632 --> 00:37:44,720
With it!

621
00:37:49,027 --> 00:37:50,738
And these two, there!

622
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:56,543
These two people.

623
00:38:05,605 --> 00:38:07,044
Stand back, please.

624
00:38:09,034 --> 00:38:09,864
Ready?

625
00:38:13,866 --> 00:38:14,879
Parés!

626
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,214
It is not too early.

627
00:38:22,931 --> 00:38:24,134
Undress yourself.

628
00:38:26,634 --> 00:38:27,442
Hurry!

629
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,022
- Michael.
- Mom!

630
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:45,155
It is comforting, but it can not
wait for my infusion of morphine?

631
00:38:45,968 --> 00:38:46,896
Sorry.

632
00:38:55,658 --> 00:38:56,948
It happened like that.

633
00:38:57,073 --> 00:38:59,564
He became furious madman,
as if he was missing.

634
00:38:59,689 --> 00:39:01,990
He waved his gun.

635
00:39:03,077 --> 00:39:04,633
You've seen "Dog Day Afternoon"?

636
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,426
Well write it all.

637
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,986
Carl thought it could
return to reason,

638
00:39:10,111 --> 00:39:12,691
but the judge kept Roy
not to tell him to shut up.

639
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:15,632
He was trying to be the hero,

640
00:39:15,757 --> 00:39:17,470
but Roy did not see it that way.

641
00:39:19,247 --> 00:39:21,566
He was shot once
it was lifted. Coldly.

642
00:39:22,499 --> 00:39:24,523
That's ridiculous.

643
00:39:24,648 --> 00:39:26,438
This was not even there!

644
00:39:26,821 --> 00:39:28,662
Fred. Come.

645
00:39:28,787 --> 00:39:30,258
Tell them the truth.

646
00:39:31,221 --> 00:39:32,536
First,

647
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:33,761
is Frank.

648
00:39:37,659 --> 00:39:40,544
And it happened exactly
as they said.

649
00:39:46,104 --> 00:39:47,485
They lie.

650
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,857
They all lie.

651
00:39:50,713 --> 00:39:53,056
If you do not believe me,
look at the records.

652
00:39:54,116 --> 00:39:55,163
Good idea.

653
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:17,873
Good service, Roy.

654
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,843
It was all on tape.

655
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:24,087
He made it, idiot.

656
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,821
<i> We must take him to the hospital. </ i>

657
00:40:25,946 --> 00:40:28,658
Not so <i>
I would not have my money. </ i>

658
00:40:28,996 --> 00:40:31,221
A doctor would not
been a bad idea.

659
00:40:32,127 --> 00:40:33,662
Come on, Bill.

660
00:40:34,438 --> 00:40:37,343
- You know me.
- Yes, I know you.

661
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,389
That's the problem.

662
00:40:41,888 --> 00:40:43,451
Bill, listen to me.

663
00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:46,148
These people are trying to trap me.

664
00:40:46,866 --> 00:40:49,788
- They had this plan from the beginning.
- You're really a geek.

665
00:40:50,952 --> 00:40:53,255
The power of geeks, baby.
Courage!

666
00:40:56,445 --> 00:40:58,862
It was very courageous,
enter here,

667
00:40:58,987 --> 00:41:00,343
like that, disarmed.

668
00:41:01,117 --> 00:41:01,937
Tell me,

669
00:41:02,062 --> 00:41:04,543
all the guys FBI
of balls as big?

670
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,367
Take care of yourself, another team
arrives to the report.

671
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,783
Come on, guys, we move.
Let's go.

672
00:41:13,908 --> 00:41:16,223
Here we go!

673
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,741
The FBI is there to do the report.

674
00:41:23,961 --> 00:41:26,358
- Got an idea of what ...
- Do with.

675
00:41:27,054 --> 00:41:29,366
Members of the FBI,
can you help me?

676
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,574
Look at this.

677
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:37,244
Our two local dealers sought.

678
00:41:37,698 --> 00:41:39,064
It's incredible.

679
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,294
Damn, it is good!

680
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:49,172
Thank you, Parker.

681
00:41:50,581 --> 00:41:52,211
Forget it.

682
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,921
It was an excellent performance.

683
00:41:55,955 --> 00:41:59,209
I think I played well
When I shouted after people.

684
00:41:59,334 --> 00:42:01,263
This is a good start.

685
00:42:01,388 --> 00:42:04,978
It must make money
the family Delgado.

686
00:42:07,422 --> 00:42:08,705
Keep quiet.

687
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:11,191
As if
on t'avait ever shot.

688
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,522
So the pizza boxes?

689
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:20,286
I know.
T'aurais not have done better.

690
00:42:20,411 --> 00:42:23,181
No. I have not found better.
