1
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:32,514
- Can I get you boys any refills?
- No, thank you, Cora.

2
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:37,266
- Can I get that back on the way out?
- If you're good, Mr. Cabella.

3
00:00:37,391 --> 00:00:39,447
- Rules are rules.
- Listen, honey.

4
00:00:40,486 --> 00:00:41,786
Our condolences.

5
00:00:42,082 --> 00:00:44,408
Your father was a kind host.

6
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:46,344
It's hard to see
his empty chair there.

7
00:00:46,732 --> 00:00:48,047
He was the best of us.

8
00:00:48,972 --> 00:00:49,803
Yes.

9
00:00:49,928 --> 00:00:51,293
To John McRory!

10
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,157
Is that mistress Cora McRory?

11
00:00:59,672 --> 00:01:01,268
I don't believe we've met, mister...

12
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,486
Mark Doyle.

13
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:05,395
This is Liam.
This is Liam's brother.

14
00:01:06,586 --> 00:01:08,141
My sympathies, by the by.

15
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:12,669
Forgive me for conducting such dirty
business on your day of mourning,

16
00:01:12,794 --> 00:01:15,408
but himself owed me a debt,
and I've come by to collect.

17
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:17,368
My father owed you money?

18
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,901
He took out a loan 12 months ago...
$5,000.

19
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,289
With interest, it's $15,000
and come due today.

20
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,972
- $15,000? I don't have that...
- Unlike yankee banks,

21
00:01:26,097 --> 00:01:27,944
I don't give unsecured loans.

22
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:30,138
Your dad put up his pub
as collateral.

23
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:37,138
The bar is all he had.

24
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,951
In this life,
some are given to need,

25
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:41,475
some provision.

26
00:01:42,113 --> 00:01:44,395
My boys tell me
you're the sole heiress.

27
00:01:45,089 --> 00:01:45,893
So...

28
00:01:46,512 --> 00:01:47,812
$15,000. Pay up.

29
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:51,005
Or, if it's easier for you,
I'll take the pub.

30
00:01:56,988 --> 00:01:58,288
Thank you, Liam.

31
00:02:03,517 --> 00:02:04,617
Go on, love.

32
00:02:05,237 --> 00:02:06,587
Collect yourself.

33
00:02:06,992 --> 00:02:08,392
Check your assets.

34
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:11,068
We'll wait for exactly two hours.

35
00:02:18,516 --> 00:02:20,313
So, this is paying respects?

36
00:02:20,438 --> 00:02:23,449
Absolutely, yeah.
I mean, it's an irish wake.

37
00:02:24,004 --> 00:02:26,587
You know there's a poker game
going on in the back room?

38
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:28,177
At one time or another,

39
00:02:28,302 --> 00:02:31,447
every man in this neighborhood played
in John McRory's friday-night game.

40
00:02:31,742 --> 00:02:35,418
It's an honor. Hell, my father
played in it for 10 years before...

41
00:02:35,543 --> 00:02:37,156
Then this was your father's local?

42
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,383
This was my father's office,
right here.

43
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:44,399
And he held court
right there on that stool.

44
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,687
And he would just...

45
00:02:47,607 --> 00:02:49,001
I grew up in this place.

46
00:02:49,487 --> 00:02:51,420
That must have been
an interesting education.

47
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,399
We can work something out.

48
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:59,570
Now, what have we learned, Nathan?

49
00:02:59,695 --> 00:03:02,032
Don't gamble
with another man's money.

50
00:03:02,827 --> 00:03:03,827
Good lad.

51
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:06,644
Yeah, better than prep school.

52
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,200
- What kind of crook was your dad?
- Parker, you just...

53
00:03:09,325 --> 00:03:10,952
He ran numbers.

54
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:14,636
Let me get this straight...
So you stop stealing, you stop drinking,

55
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,987
and you moved upstairs
from a thief bar?

56
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,603
He did. I get that.
You don't get that?

57
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,617
- Why does nobody else get that?
- No, the thing about it is...

58
00:03:23,934 --> 00:03:25,838
Now it's just a neighborhood bar.

59
00:03:25,963 --> 00:03:28,573
Back in the day, you never knew
who you were drinking next to.

60
00:03:28,698 --> 00:03:30,862
You had the mob on one side,
the law on the other.

61
00:03:31,138 --> 00:03:32,253
Times have changed.

62
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,201
Not that much, but...

63
00:03:34,425 --> 00:03:36,629
Cora here...
I remember the day she was born.

64
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:39,967
She grew up here, too,
and she turned out all right.

65
00:03:40,092 --> 00:03:40,900
Cora?

66
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:47,903
Redheads burn the hottest,
don't they?

67
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:50,365
Easy.

68
00:03:50,623 --> 00:03:51,955
She's like my niece.

69
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,691
She's not like
your daughter, though.

70
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,398
No, like my niece.

71
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:58,517
So I don't want you to like my niece
'cause she's like my niece.

72
00:03:58,642 --> 00:04:00,993
- I don't like your niece.
- You know what I mean.

73
00:04:01,118 --> 00:04:03,158
There. That's all we have.

74
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:05,823
Let's see, now.

75
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,391
$210.

76
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,648
Noted.

77
00:04:16,693 --> 00:04:17,548
Well...

78
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:21,240
That's only $14,790 to go.

79
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:37,467
The rich and powerful,
they take what they want.

80
00:04:37,703 --> 00:04:39,111
We steal it back for you.

81
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:46,952
And sometimes, bad guys
make the best good guys.

82
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:50,623
We provide...

83
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:53,414
leverage!

84
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,339
Season 2 - Episode 11
The Bottle Job

85
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,938
His name is Mark Doyle.
He's irish.

86
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:05,728
You know, he says dad took out
a loan from him a year ago.

87
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:08,919
I didn't believe him at first.
Thank you.

88
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,435
But I realize...

89
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,206
that it was just before
the cancer took mom.

90
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,007
You know, I tried to help him
with the bills.

91
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,479
He swore he had it under control.

92
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,440
I could have stopped this!

93
00:05:24,565 --> 00:05:27,703
Well, no, listen. This guy Doyle...
He's a loan shark.

94
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:30,563
I don't think you could have helped.
But maybe we can.

95
00:05:31,656 --> 00:05:35,008
No, he wants $15,000
in the next two hours,

96
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:36,582
Nate, or he's taking the bar.

97
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:39,672
I can't get that kind of money.
In two hours?

98
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:42,824
Why don't you do this, okay?
Why don't you go back downstairs

99
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:44,405
and tend to the guests.


100
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,576
And we'll try
to figure out something here.

101
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:47,554
Okay?

102
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,180
Thank you.

103
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,814
Why don't we just send her
to the police?

104
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,959
I don't use them,
but this is what they're for, right?

105
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:03,140
No, if Cora says to the police
that she owes Doyle money,

106
00:06:03,265 --> 00:06:04,476
Doyle denies it.

107
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:07,494
Six months later,
he comes and burns down the bar.

108
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:11,065
And that's assuming that he doesn't have
a couple of local police on the arm.

109
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,080
That's what sucks
about the credit crunch.

110
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,412
Honest people can't get loans,
sharks move in.

111
00:06:15,537 --> 00:06:17,401
12 points on the interest
every month...

112
00:06:17,526 --> 00:06:19,397
There's no way to get out
from under that.

113
00:06:19,522 --> 00:06:22,401
I don't care. You don't collect debts
at a wake. You just don't do it.

114
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,410
Want me to go downstairs,
break this guy's knees?

115
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,873
we need some reconnaissance, like,

116
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:32,016
why is this irish loan shark here?

117
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:33,892
And what is this 2-hour timetable?

118
00:06:34,548 --> 00:06:36,849
Why don't you call Tara?
Tell her we got a job.

119
00:06:45,897 --> 00:06:47,013
What's the game?

120
00:06:47,138 --> 00:06:49,033
- 20 questions.
- I'll do it in 10.

121
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:51,410
- That one?
- Right there.

122
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:03,905
I'm Trish, and I'm lonely.

123
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,512
Shot of Jamie, rocks.

124
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:15,597
That's only a bit of irish.

125
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:19,700
How'd you like a whole lot of irish?

126
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:24,568
And what do you do?

127
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:28,667
Typical. Only americans ask
for your occupation before your name.

128
00:07:29,818 --> 00:07:31,500
I'm a bank, sweetheart.

129
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,997
- You're a bit short for a bank.
- Very clever.

130
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:40,095
It's a family business, mine...
Based back in Belfast.

131
00:07:40,796 --> 00:07:43,837
I'm the VP in charge
of overseas expansion.

132
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,606
Slow down.
I love it. I love it.

133
00:07:50,215 --> 00:07:52,137
Nothing but cash and an ID.

134
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,146
I'm running it, but we got
next to nothing on this guy.

135
00:07:57,271 --> 00:07:58,987
No bank accounts, no credit cards.

136
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:00,944
He's totally off the grid.

137
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,858
Mark Doyle, loan shark.

138
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:11,140
If I were ashamed,
I couldn't do my job, could I?

139
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:14,020
I provide a service
for people with no recourse,

140
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:16,324
help those
with nowhere else to turn.

141
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,163
Society needs me.

142
00:08:19,052 --> 00:08:21,044
Right. But isn't it...

143
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:22,938
Illegal?

144
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,591
As me da says, we pick up
where the law leaves off.

145
00:08:34,735 --> 00:08:36,897
Got something on dear old da...

146
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:40,060
Tim Doyle. He not only runs
the family loan-sharking business

147
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,272
but used to kill people
with nail bombs for the IRA.

148
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,306
I convinced me da to let me open
a branch over here in Boston.

149
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:47,818
Grow the business, as it were.

150
00:08:48,531 --> 00:08:51,508
For 200 years, America took
Ireland's best and brightest.

151
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:53,699
I'm just here
to collect the interest.

152
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,993
You are so smart.

153
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:57,829
So...

154
00:08:58,678 --> 00:09:00,873
Why is it that everyone else
is broke and you're not?

155
00:09:01,713 --> 00:09:02,816
Cash only, love.

156
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:04,334
That's the secret.

157
00:09:04,684 --> 00:09:08,005
Numbers on a screen can be manipulated,
but a cash business endures.

158
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:11,300
It was good enough for my da and his da.
It's good enough for me.

159
00:09:11,703 --> 00:09:12,930
I got plane tickets.

160
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:15,282
Doyle's headed for Belfast
in a couple of hours.

161
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:18,961
That explains the deadline.
But why take the bag of cash?

162
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:20,960
Tara, I need you to ask something.

163
00:09:21,326 --> 00:09:22,644
How long are you in town?

164
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:24,666
Leaving tonight.

165
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,669
Annual review, sort of.

166
00:09:26,993 --> 00:09:29,484
Show my new branch
of the business is profitable.

167
00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:32,092
How profitable?

168
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,629
That's not all of it, mind.

169
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,894
Just enough to repay me da
for his investment

170
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:54,539
and prove that this branch
is very profitable indeed.

171
00:09:55,187 --> 00:09:56,197
Well, then...

172
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,402
You can buy a girl a drink.

173
00:10:01,036 --> 00:10:02,253
I'll be right back.

174
00:10:07,971 --> 00:10:08,948
Same again.

175
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,798
We can't just steal the note.
It's only gonna tick this guy off.

176
00:10:15,923 --> 00:10:18,534
- Can we con him in two hours?
- More like an hour and a half.

177
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:20,884
We can't pull something
together this fast.

178
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:22,537
50 bucks. I got 50 bucks.

179
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,335
I need you to tell me what live sports
are being broadcast right now.

180
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,215
Tara, set the hook.
You guys, I need cash.

181
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,520
No. It's impossible.

182
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:31,201
You want to run the wire...

183
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:32,928
in two hours.

184
00:10:33,053 --> 00:10:34,127
One and a half.

185
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:35,799
Wire's three weeks, minimum.

186
00:10:35,924 --> 00:10:38,257
Look at it as
the wire in a bottle, okay?

187
00:10:38,382 --> 00:10:40,638
No one's ever done it
doesn't mean it's impossible.

188
00:10:40,763 --> 00:10:41,607
It does.

189
00:10:41,732 --> 00:10:44,218
- What are we supposed to do?
- Have some respect...

190
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,979
Borrow the wake to save the bar.

191
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,234


192
00:10:55,793 --> 00:10:57,759
Okay, guys, nothing fancy.

193
00:10:58,254 --> 00:11:00,926
Classic wire.
You delay the sports feed.

194
00:11:01,451 --> 00:11:05,320
Now I know what's gonna happen,
he doesn't, I get him to bet.

195
00:11:06,203 --> 00:11:07,488
Now, where's my cash?

196
00:11:07,718 --> 00:11:11,717
It is 9:00 pm on a friday night.
All the banks are closed.

197
00:11:11,842 --> 00:11:14,009
- ATMs.
- Daily withdrawal limit.

198
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:17,315
If y'all want me to do an electronic
wire transfer of 100 grand

199
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,572
between the Caymans and Madagascar,
I can do that.

200
00:11:19,697 --> 00:11:22,797
But if you're talking cold, hard cash,
you're out of luck. I'm sorry.

201
00:11:22,922 --> 00:11:25,434
Just use your little slimmer thing,
and gank the ATMs.

202
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,628
It's called a skimmer.
But thank you for trying.

203
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,485
I don't have that thing anymore.

204
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,195
We're the good guys now.
I haven't used that thing in months.

205
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,160
Months?

206
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:36,635
We've been the good guys
longer than that.

207
00:11:36,868 --> 00:11:38,322
Well, we had a break.

208
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,990
Can we please focus?

209
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,035
Emergency fund.

210
00:12:08,503 --> 00:12:09,564
What are you doing?

211
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:12,339
What, you thought I kept old Nate around
for sentimental reasons?

212
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,359
Relax.

213
00:12:26,714 --> 00:12:29,074
Just a little over nine grand.
That enough?

214
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:31,481
Yeah, I don't need enough to win,
just enough to lose.

215
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:32,793
It's perfect.

216
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:36,228
- I'll take care of the muscle.
- All right.

217
00:12:37,621 --> 00:12:39,883
Hardison, let me know
when you got control of the feeds.

218
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:59,366
Here.

219
00:12:59,491 --> 00:13:01,910
This is the cable to the television
in the bar downstairs.

220
00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:12,851
We're ready down here.

221
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,859
I'm about to splice...

222
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:16,294
Well, everything.

223
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:23,718
- Perfect.
- Come on, Trish. Don't be like that.

224
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,387
It was nice meeting you, Mark.

225
00:13:29,737 --> 00:13:32,046
Thanks a lot, you goby.
I was making headway there.

226
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:35,147
Sorry. I'll make it up to you.
Get this guy a drink. Whatever he wants.

227
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,690
Give me an empty glass

228
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,094
and a bottle of the most
expensive scotch you've got.

229
00:13:39,538 --> 00:13:40,844
Well, well-played.

230
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,757
- What's the story with the blonde?
- The blonde, yeah...

231
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,868
I used to go out with her
until I broke her brother's kneecaps.

232
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,706
Gambling debt. You don't pay,
you don't walk, in my book.

233
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,210
I don't care who you are.

234
00:13:52,814 --> 00:13:53,754
All right.

235
00:13:54,338 --> 00:13:56,488
I'll drink to that.
Have a seat.

236
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:01,030
- Get him a glass, will you?
- That's very kind of you.

237
00:14:01,976 --> 00:14:03,075
What's your name?

238
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:04,862
Name's, Jimy.

239
00:14:05,392 --> 00:14:07,686
- Jimmy Ford.
- Good to meet you, Jimmy.

240
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,714
Slainte!

241
00:14:22,725 --> 00:14:24,525
Okay, we are up and running.

242
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,365
Now, I've set the tv in the bar
on a 20-second delay.

243
00:14:28,938 --> 00:14:31,325
Sisko just hit a jumper
from the baseline.

244
00:14:32,213 --> 00:14:34,365
We need info from the bodyguards,
but I'm burned.

245
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,290
On it.

246
00:14:41,466 --> 00:14:42,839
You make book on this game?

247
00:14:44,604 --> 00:14:46,209
How about a little action?

248
00:14:47,337 --> 00:14:48,929
Without the juice, of course.

249
00:14:51,282 --> 00:14:52,282
All right.

250
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,854
$100 that Sisko misses.

251
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,010
I'll take that.

252
00:15:01,437 --> 00:15:03,446
<i>...to Sisko.
He's picked up by Wanzer.</i>

253
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:06,112
<i>Sisko from 20!
Bomb!</i>

254
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:11,205
For a bookie, Jimmy,
you're not much of a gambler.

255
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:22,182
What's your problem?

256
00:15:23,433 --> 00:15:24,868
You remind me of my sister.

257
00:15:30,826 --> 00:15:33,235
It's all in the wrist.
How are you? Good to see you.

258
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,241
Can I buy beers for my boys and for me.
We're gonna play a little darts here.

259
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:39,104
Do that again.

260
00:15:39,493 --> 00:15:40,394
All right.

261
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,017
I'll show you how to do that.

262
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:51,943
I'll take this one.

263
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,309
- Take these.
- Right.

264
00:15:59,145 --> 00:16:00,951
There it is.
Look at that... some ale.

265
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,422
Let me get these for the boys here.

266
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:05,186
- One for you.
- Cheers.

267
00:16:06,282 --> 00:16:07,282
Good game.

268
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,541
- You like that?
- Love, give us a whack.

269
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,681
There you go, right?
Feisty little thing.

270
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,602
I got their cellphones
and their wallets.

271
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,690
Also lifted this...
Doyle's ledger.

272
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:27,969
It's written in code.

273
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:35,565
All right. Another $500...

274
00:16:37,132 --> 00:16:38,194
that he misses.

275
00:16:39,812 --> 00:16:42,723
- Done.
- <i>He puts it up again and drains it!</i>

276
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:46,054
I almost feel bad taking your money.

277
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:51,023
What, you too good to drink with me?

278
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:53,920
No, I'm not betting again

279
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:56,605
if you have the advantage of me,
Jimmy boy.

280
00:17:07,231 --> 00:17:09,194
Well, you're right.
I mean, I might as well.

281
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,751
You know, I mean,
I'm getting my ass handed to me.

282
00:17:12,847 --> 00:17:16,119
You know, drowning
my own sorrows here, right?

283
00:17:39,786 --> 00:17:41,017
So, this is...

284
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,185
Not good.

285
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:46,022
I'm grabbing all I can off of Liam one
and two's cellphones.

286
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,290
We may be able to use
any common GPS coordinates

287
00:17:49,415 --> 00:17:51,444
to triangulate the location
of Doyle's office.

288
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,639
And I'm close
to decoding this ledger.

289
00:17:53,764 --> 00:17:55,865
- Names?
- And alphanumeric substitutions.

290
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,208
You know how to read that?

291
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,412
Yeah, I trained in cryptog...

292
00:18:02,065 --> 00:18:03,054
Never mind.

293
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,965
Archer just got robbed.

294
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:13,821
<i>Layup at the other end.</i>

295
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:16,579
Okay, $1,000 says
Archer gets schooled.

296
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:18,143
No way.

297
00:18:18,812 --> 00:18:21,408
<i>He looks. Now he drives the lane.
Ball stripped by Arnie Risen!</i>

298
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,101
<i>Now the pass to Myers...</i>

299
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,882
Archer gets payback,
double or nothing.

300
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:28,648
- <i>No, turnover. You're good.</i>
- <i>Inbound by Archer. He throws it away!</i>

301
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,942
Who are you throwing it to?
There's no one there!

302
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,237
What the hell?
I'm playing with your money anyway.

303
00:18:35,506 --> 00:18:38,908
For a loan shark, you're not very good
with money, are you?

304
00:18:42,461 --> 00:18:44,898
So I got Mike Duffy, 78 oak street.

305
00:18:45,573 --> 00:18:47,690
Borrowed money to put his mom
in a nursing home.

306
00:18:47,815 --> 00:18:50,007
- Alison McCoy.
- I got her.

307
00:18:50,246 --> 00:18:52,077
Special-needs child.
School bills.

308
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:54,716
You know, Nate,
we just cracked this ledger,

309
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,594
and Doyle is way deeper into this
neighborhood than we thought.

310
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,792
Boston wins with a three-pointer.

311
00:19:04,512 --> 00:19:07,650
That pile of cash in front of you
looks mighty inviting.

312
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:12,692
I got a plane to catch.
One last bet?

313
00:19:14,202 --> 00:19:16,943
Well, I mean, there's
almost $10,000 here.

314
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,656
You have the cash to match it?

315
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:30,335
My cash has other obligations.

316
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,125
- I'm not gonna take a marker.
- You don't have to take my marker.

317
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,263
Take hers.

318
00:19:39,273 --> 00:19:41,672
- How do I know she's good for it?
- You don't.

319
00:19:42,165 --> 00:19:43,765
That's why it's called "gambling."

320
00:19:44,427 --> 00:19:45,495
How's it going?

321
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:47,704
You boys doing good?

322
00:19:50,776 --> 00:19:52,067
What's Nate thinking?

323
00:19:52,878 --> 00:19:53,775
He's not.

324
00:19:54,874 --> 00:19:56,574
Nate, you got 10 seconds.

325
00:19:56,699 --> 00:19:58,863
- Place the damn bet!
- Don't be cocky, Nate.

326
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:06,741
All right.

327
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,183
Let it ride.

328
00:20:09,924 --> 00:20:11,024
Boston wins?

329
00:20:11,675 --> 00:20:12,479
Done.

330
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,799
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

331
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,009
That's what I'm talking about
right there!

332
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,434
I didn't realize you were quite that
into basketball.

333
00:20:23,116 --> 00:20:24,597
Basketball? Woman,

334
00:20:24,722 --> 00:20:27,655
we just pulled off the wire in the time
it takes to get a pizza delivered.

335
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,436
This is a big win... big!
They're gonna talk about this one.

336
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,234
<i>Three pointer... he got it!
He got it! Boston wins!</i>

337
00:20:35,284 --> 00:20:36,689
No hard feelings, right?

338
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:40,634
You know what?
Good riddance.

339
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:43,013
That bitch is your problem now.

340
00:20:44,418 --> 00:20:46,289
It was a fine way to kill some time.

341
00:20:47,477 --> 00:20:50,272
I come back, maybe we can do
some real business, Jimmy Ford.

342
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,660
You're on.

343
00:21:00,455 --> 00:21:01,766
We got lucky on that one.

344
00:21:01,891 --> 00:21:03,885
- We're not letting him go.
- But we saved the bar.

345
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,451
We're not letting him go.
The night's just getting started.

346
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,929


347
00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:12,366
He goes back to Ireland
and flashes that money at his father,

348
00:21:12,491 --> 00:21:15,919
he'll be back here within a week
with more muscle, heat, and protection.

349
00:21:16,356 --> 00:21:19,319
And then he'll be in every corner.
We won't be able to pry him loose.

350
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,695
How can you be sure?

351
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,470
Because that's what my father did.

352
00:21:23,244 --> 00:21:25,366
No, I know this guy.
I know what he's about.

353
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,721
Right now, right here...

354
00:21:26,846 --> 00:21:29,621
This is the time to put a spike
in him for good. It's our only shot.

355
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:30,658
Final sh...

356
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:33,458
<i>Do you have another con
up your sleeve?</i>

357
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,878
No. Yeah. Well, this one's
maybe a little bit more...

358
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,004
<i>impossible.</i>

359
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,787
Guys, let's go to the storage room.
Tara, stall him. Stall him.

360
00:21:46,381 --> 00:21:48,694
- Hey, beautiful.
- Don't "beautiful" me.

361
00:21:49,283 --> 00:21:52,017
Sorry. Men's business.
Money's money, love.

362
00:21:52,588 --> 00:21:53,804
Look, I'm heading out.

363
00:21:53,972 --> 00:21:56,773
- Give you a ring when I'm back?
- You're not going anywhere.

364
00:21:57,257 --> 00:21:59,062
It's turning into
a blizzard out there.

365
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:00,410
Doesn't look too bad.

366
00:22:00,535 --> 00:22:02,781
I couldn't get to
the corner shop for smokes. But,

367
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,521
you want to sit in the tunnel
for three hours, be my guest.

368
00:22:06,142 --> 00:22:08,910
Can't have that.
Liam's brother here is claustrophobic.

369
00:22:10,553 --> 00:22:11,526
Fair enough.

370
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,823
Let's check
the weather on the telly.

371
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,348
Yeah, let's check
the weather on telly.

372
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:18,426
Check the weather on wh...

373
00:22:19,223 --> 00:22:20,582
Woman, you did not.

374
00:22:23,324 --> 00:22:25,861
Okay, so we're gonna lure him
into a high-stakes poker game.

375
00:22:25,986 --> 00:22:27,504
Except we have no high stakes.

376
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:30,223
- And no poker game.
- I got enough to slow-play for maybe

377
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,653
a half-hour or so. Hardison,
have you found Doyle's address yet?

378
00:22:33,778 --> 00:22:34,950
<i>I'm a little busy.</i>

379
00:22:36,608 --> 00:22:38,606
This green blanket have
any special memories?

380
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:40,112
No. Why?

381
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:41,609
No reason.

382
00:22:46,404 --> 00:22:48,890
The computer's still grinding out
the cellphone information.

383
00:22:49,015 --> 00:22:51,289
I will hit you
as soon as I get an address.

384
00:23:01,025 --> 00:23:03,623
- I think this thing needs batteries.
- Here. I got it.

385
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:07,159
Okay, you guys hit the road.
Hardison's gonna text you the address.

386
00:23:07,284 --> 00:23:08,795
Now, Doyle... He deals in cash.

387
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,368
The rest of it will be at his office,
so bring it to me.

388
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:14,058
His money? You want to play
against Doyle with his own money?

389
00:23:14,335 --> 00:23:18,108
If we pull this off, Doyle is gonna
leave every dime he owns on that table.

390
00:23:18,233 --> 00:23:21,178
Now, I assure you, his father
will never forgive him for that.

391
00:23:21,303 --> 00:23:22,959
What if I can't crack his safe?

392
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:26,645
Seriously? Come on.

393
00:23:27,665 --> 00:23:29,528
Let me ask you one more question...

394
00:23:29,653 --> 00:23:32,212
Would you even consider trying this
if you were sober?

395
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,467
I'd consider it.

396
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:01,909
There you go.

397
00:24:02,302 --> 00:24:04,344
<i>Thank you, Chet. So...</i>

398
00:24:05,297 --> 00:24:07,779
<i>We are really snowed in here,
up in...</i>

399
00:24:08,636 --> 00:24:09,864
Wrong side, Hardison.

400
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,032
<i>Seattle,</i>

401
00:24:11,753 --> 00:24:13,452
but it's way worse here in Boston.

402
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,339
<i>The highways are jam-packed.</i>

403
00:24:15,464 --> 00:24:17,622
<i>The turnpike is shut down
at the 495 interchange.</i>

404
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:20,792
<i>No flights in or out of Logan
for a couple of hours. You know what?</i>

405
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,653
<i>If you are a stay-at-home mom,
you break out the wine and the xanax,</i>

406
00:24:23,778 --> 00:24:25,838
<i>because we are having
snow days here, people.</i>

407
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,251
<i>Back at...</i>

408
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,063
Give me a sec.

409
00:24:31,481 --> 00:24:32,345
All clear.

410
00:24:32,641 --> 00:24:33,813
<i>Is that my jacket?</i>

411
00:24:33,938 --> 00:24:36,860
You know what, man? You're lucky
I'm not wearing your underwear.

412
00:24:36,985 --> 00:24:38,282
And the next time

413
00:24:38,407 --> 00:24:41,127
y'all call me,
it better be for something easy,

414
00:24:41,252 --> 00:24:42,896
like faking a moon landing.

415
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:46,989
Tara...
Here's what I need you to tell him.

416
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,451
All right, give me a few minutes.
Wait here.

417
00:24:53,197 --> 00:24:55,950
Looks like we have some time
to talk after all, macushla.

418
00:24:56,075 --> 00:24:58,564
Should have played with me
instead of Jimmy the first time.

419
00:24:58,689 --> 00:25:00,903
- Fair enough.
- You wouldn't have got cheated.

420
00:25:01,028 --> 00:25:02,883
- Can I get a rum and coke?
- Wait, what?

421
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:04,784
He cheated you.

422
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:07,874
He does it to all the tourists who come
in the bar. Rum and diet coke, actually.

423
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:08,927
Explain.

424
00:25:11,256 --> 00:25:12,990
The crappy cable tv in this bar...

425
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,580
The sports channels are all
on a local 5-minute delay,

426
00:25:15,705 --> 00:25:18,377
so Jimmy spots a mark, calls a friend
who's watching on satellite,

427
00:25:18,502 --> 00:25:20,977
and he gets the action
texted to him on his phone.

428
00:25:21,321 --> 00:25:23,255
You didn't see him
looking at his phone?

429
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:25,683
He ran you right up.

430
00:25:26,881 --> 00:25:28,909
Why didn't you tell me this
the first time?

431
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,713
Men's business.

432
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:32,905
You hurt my feelings.

433
00:25:34,136 --> 00:25:35,073
Stay here.

434
00:25:35,425 --> 00:25:36,901
I'm gonna kick his arse...

435
00:25:37,698 --> 00:25:38,964
Then I'll be back...

436
00:25:39,503 --> 00:25:41,120
Hurt your feelings a bit more.

437
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,565
All right.

438
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,212
- Nate, did you find the money?
- I need you. Tara?

439
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,512
<i>Here's the trick.</i>

440
00:25:49,637 --> 00:25:51,719
We're not gonna cheat him.
He's gonna cheat us.

441
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:54,339
- Who's Tara?
- Wait, you can't go back there.

442
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,604
- Wait. He's playing cards.
- So?

443
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,713
So, it's a protected game.

444
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:01,507
You've heard about McRory's.
Everybody comes here.

445
00:26:01,632 --> 00:26:03,860
Everybody back in that room
is a heavy hitter.

446
00:26:04,843 --> 00:26:07,190
- How heavy?
- Local families...

447
00:26:07,604 --> 00:26:09,760
Irish, some italians
from the North Shore.

448
00:26:10,143 --> 00:26:11,846
Sometimes a guy comes up
from Providence.

449
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:13,606
But you start something in there...

450
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:16,691
Look, come back to the bar.
Buy Trishie a drink.

451
00:26:18,281 --> 00:26:19,792
Ford's back there playing?

452
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:24,540
I'm not a bad card player myself.

453
00:26:25,023 --> 00:26:26,488
I don't know about this.

454
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,253
My brother's not so sure, either.

455
00:26:29,757 --> 00:26:32,613
See? Liam and...
Liam's brother are right.

456
00:26:32,738 --> 00:26:36,219
- He's already shown he can beat you.
- Cheat me and nobody cheats a Doyle.

457
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,449
It's not like you can go in
and cheat him back.

458
00:26:38,574 --> 00:26:40,833
He's the best at this.
This is how he makes a living.

459
00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:43,578
Your father never has to know
that you got burned.

460
00:26:43,842 --> 00:26:45,567
Your dad never has to find out.

461
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:50,149
He was sweet on you, right?

462
00:26:51,497 --> 00:26:53,152
He didn't see you with me just now.

463
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:55,529
- I don't think so.
- What would he do

464
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:58,866
if you went in there
and sat on his lap?

465
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,911
What would you do?

466
00:27:03,835 --> 00:27:05,394
I think this'll work.

467
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,811
- This'll never work.
- Of course it will.

468
00:27:10,186 --> 00:27:11,045
Gentlemen,

469
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,882
I have a proposal for you.

470
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:19,901
Gentlemen,
I have a proposal for you.

471
00:27:20,124 --> 00:27:23,147
- Who the hell are you?
- Mickey, this is Jimmy Ford's son,

472
00:27:23,272 --> 00:27:24,137
Nate.

473
00:27:26,147 --> 00:27:27,880
You anything like your father?

474
00:27:29,476 --> 00:27:32,077
With the guys he's playing with,
pulling something's too risky.

475
00:27:32,202 --> 00:27:33,693
You help me clean out Ford,

476
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:35,385
you earn 5%.

477
00:27:38,021 --> 00:27:38,823
10%.

478
00:27:41,264 --> 00:27:42,118
That a girl.

479
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:43,953
10% it is.

480
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,746
Okay, let's keep it simple...

481
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,436
You cozy up to him
and give me either

482
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:50,468
"Tom"

483
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,032
or "George."

484
00:27:52,852 --> 00:27:54,297
Tom is bad for me.

485
00:27:55,035 --> 00:27:56,769
George is good for me.

486
00:27:57,343 --> 00:28:00,367
So if Ford has, say,
pocket aces, you will...

487
00:28:03,554 --> 00:28:04,679
Good girl.

488
00:28:08,174 --> 00:28:09,562
I don't know about this, Cora.

489
00:28:09,948 --> 00:28:12,322
Listen, I'll take the heat
if anything goes wrong.

490
00:28:12,447 --> 00:28:14,584
All you guys got to do
is just keep playing.

491
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:15,526
Please...

492
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,007
For dad.

493
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:20,698
Buy-in's 20 bucks.

494
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:22,165
Okay. All right.

495
00:28:22,704 --> 00:28:24,618
Blues are ones.
Whites are five.

496
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,423
Okay, now, listen, he may want
to buy in for slightly higher.

497
00:28:27,548 --> 00:28:30,374
Are you okay with making him
think there's more in the pot?

498
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,418
The less I know about this,
the better.

499
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,660
He's in.
I'm supposed to be softening you up.

500
00:28:34,785 --> 00:28:35,762
All right.

501
00:28:36,242 --> 00:28:39,175
- Could I borrow him for one sec?
- What?

502
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:41,221
These locals don't look
anything like mob guys.

503
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:43,647
No, they're McRory's friends.
They're all I got.

504
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,352
You actually think Doyle's
gonna buy their act?

505
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,707
They'll be fine, okay?
Everything's fine.

506
00:28:48,832 --> 00:28:51,711
Hardison, you find out where Doyle keeps
the rest of his money?

507
00:28:51,918 --> 00:28:53,856
<i>Using the Liams' cellphone,
I've been able to map</i>

508
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,817
the GPS fingerprints of their recent
calls and analyze their patterns

509
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,447
- <i>of movements throughout the city.</i>
- <i>He led us to a warehouse.</i>

510
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:00,446
We're in now.

511
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:03,220
<i>I'm sorry... "led you"?
"Led you to the warehouse"?</i>

512
00:29:03,345 --> 00:29:06,361
I had two cellphones and two minutes.
Do you know who else can do what I do?

513
00:29:06,486 --> 00:29:07,870
CIA, MI6 and me.

514
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:10,956
Okay, Eliot,
I want every last penny of Doyle's

515
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,466
<i>to end up on that table.</i>

516
00:29:12,591 --> 00:29:14,944
- We'll clean it out.
- Yeah, if we can find it.

517
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,421
Seriously,

518
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,702
<i>you want me to find the safe
for you, too, now?</i>

519
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:22,462
I got you to the warehouse.
Go find someone to punch.

520
00:29:24,585 --> 00:29:27,515
Now, what I need you to
do is let him win slowly,

521
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,511
until the money gets here,
then flip him.

522
00:29:29,636 --> 00:29:31,589
I want him walking out
of here with nothing.

523
00:29:31,714 --> 00:29:33,413
You do realize this is insane?

524
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:36,357
You didn't say "impossible."
You're softening.

525
00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:39,193
She warned me you were a drunk.

526
00:29:39,552 --> 00:29:41,181
Yeah, it's different than before.

527
00:29:41,306 --> 00:29:43,666
Before, I used to think I was okay
when I was drunk.

528
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:44,824
And now?

529
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:45,826
Now...

530
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,452
I know I'm not okay.

531
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:53,534
20 grand. Good.

532
00:29:54,155 --> 00:29:55,316
Stay right here.

533
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:57,975
If Ford walks out
with any money left,

534
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,568
follow him around the corner
and take it back.

535
00:30:08,341 --> 00:30:09,424
Evening, gentlemen.

536
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:12,243
What do you think you're doing, Doyle?
This is an invite-only game.

537
00:30:12,368 --> 00:30:14,848
- Then invite me.
- Well, it's not my call. Listen.

538
00:30:15,668 --> 00:30:17,823
You know who these guys are?
That's Mickey Donnelly,

539
00:30:17,948 --> 00:30:21,068
Johnny "the fist" Cabella, Danny McCann.
I can't cross them.

540
00:30:26,749 --> 00:30:27,757
Cash plays?

541
00:30:29,749 --> 00:30:31,120
- Cash plays.
- Nice.

542
00:30:33,663 --> 00:30:35,690
A lot more where
that came from, boys.

543
00:30:36,856 --> 00:30:39,253
All right, ante up, gentlemen.
The game's five-card draw.

544
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,559
Mickey?

545
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:48,652
What do you do?

546
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:51,758
Let's be interesting about it,
shall we?

547
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,783
I'll see that and add another five.

548
00:31:04,143 --> 00:31:05,104
I'll call.

549
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,409
Just give me two.

550
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:13,086
All right, we got it.

551
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:15,039
- Too rich for me.
- You're done.

552
00:31:19,156 --> 00:31:20,199
I'll see you.

553
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:21,265
Call.

554
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:24,298
- Well, not for me.
- I only got a small pair.

555
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:27,289
You're bluffing.
Don't bet your nancy.

556
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:30,512
1, 2, 3.

557
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:32,798
Yeah, I'll see you.

558
00:31:33,945 --> 00:31:35,495
I'll double it again.

559
00:31:36,707 --> 00:31:38,464
You'll see me on the next hand.

560
00:31:39,217 --> 00:31:40,217
I'm out.

561
00:31:40,605 --> 00:31:41,705
Who's it to?

562
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:44,777
- I believe it's on Jimmy.
- Are you out, big man?

563
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,764
Hang on. I'll see you.

564
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,407
Call you.

565
00:31:51,984 --> 00:31:53,084
Nicely done.

566
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,304
Nicely done.

567
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,290
Nice hand, Mr. Doyle.

568
00:31:58,012 --> 00:32:00,162
Running a little low there, Ford.

569
00:32:00,554 --> 00:32:02,794
Relax. My niece is coming
with more cash.

570
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:05,130
I'll buy back in. Not a problem.

571
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,530
I'm gonna get a drink.

572
00:32:09,331 --> 00:32:10,781
All right, ante up.

573
00:32:12,421 --> 00:32:14,149
What's the ETA on the cash?

574
00:32:14,274 --> 00:32:15,453
<i>We're at the safe.</i>

575
00:32:15,578 --> 00:32:17,730
Parker wants to take it out
for dinner and drinks first.

576
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:20,294
This is a glen-reeder prestige
from the '20s.

577
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:21,769
So many memories.

578
00:32:21,992 --> 00:32:24,858
- <i>All right, tell her to pick it up.</i>
- Come on, Parker.

579
00:32:26,136 --> 00:32:29,536
I would move a lot faster
if you weren't stomping around.

580
00:32:30,942 --> 00:32:33,292
It's not me stomping.
I don't stomp.

581
00:32:39,677 --> 00:32:43,544
We are gonna do some serious business
in this town, my father and me.

582
00:32:44,169 --> 00:32:46,504
You gents are huge in this town.

583
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:48,779
We should get to know each other.

584
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:52,051
- Sure.
- We're already making our mark.

585
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,720
Like Mickey.

586
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:56,473
You remember that deal went down
with the O'Hares last autumn?

587
00:32:58,337 --> 00:33:00,728
- I remember it.
- You involved in that?

588
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:04,056
You could say that.

589
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:06,567
That job would have been a mess
without me.

590
00:33:07,215 --> 00:33:10,386
I was the one who told them
to use cigar boxes

591
00:33:10,631 --> 00:33:12,381
instead of orange crates.

592
00:33:32,699 --> 00:33:34,631
Ford, are you buggering off already?

593
00:33:34,756 --> 00:33:35,806
No, I'm in.

594
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,090
Eliot, Parker, hurry up.

595
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:10,506
Hey, come here.

596
00:34:24,316 --> 00:34:26,355
Would you...
I can't hear a thing!

597
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,284
- I had it.
- I am trying to work here.

598
00:34:39,552 --> 00:34:40,552
Hurry up.

599
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,471
I'm out.

600
00:35:01,952 --> 00:35:03,902
You out of your league, Ford?

601
00:35:06,786 --> 00:35:07,936
Just in time.

602
00:35:08,617 --> 00:35:10,217
Thank you, sweetheart.

603
00:35:12,758 --> 00:35:13,808
Cash plays.

604
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:21,829
What's wrong there, Doyle?
Cash plays, right?

605
00:35:26,947 --> 00:35:28,197
Let's see, now.

606
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,468
- $210.
- Noted.

607
00:35:47,942 --> 00:35:50,392
What kind of eejit
do you take me for?

608
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,696


609
00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:58,112
Doyle, what are you getting
so upset about?

610
00:35:58,237 --> 00:36:00,944
- We're just playing a little game here.
- I know the game you're playing.

611
00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:04,019
You're all playing it together...
With my money!

612
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:06,412
This is my mark.

613
00:36:07,586 --> 00:36:09,041
I've just spent the last year

614
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:12,419
running the only bank that would lend
to any plank and neddy in this hole.

615
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:16,380
And I marked every damn dollar
I collected...

616
00:36:16,646 --> 00:36:17,633
Like so.

617
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:19,467
So you're a loan shark!

618
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:21,720
I'm a loan shark.

619
00:36:22,171 --> 00:36:23,679
And these are my teeth.

620
00:36:24,624 --> 00:36:26,266
No one cheats a Doyle.

621
00:36:27,231 --> 00:36:29,202
I'd put that thing down.

622
00:36:29,327 --> 00:36:32,026
- You don't know who these guys are.
- I know exactly who they are.

623
00:36:32,151 --> 00:36:35,765
A bunch of local thicks you recruited
for this little game of yours.

624
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,290
Game's over, boys.

625
00:36:40,126 --> 00:36:41,990
Start handing over your money.

626
00:36:42,393 --> 00:36:44,413
I'd put that gun down if I were you.

627
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:46,673
What, this another prop
for your wee game?

628
00:36:46,798 --> 00:36:50,005
Yeah, and this is a prop I got
from the Boston Police Department.

629
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,165
You point that gun at me again,

630
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,752
and I'll be calling my friend
in the coroner's office.

631
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,255
You're a friggin' guard?

632
00:36:56,424 --> 00:36:58,966
I think he prefers "detective,"
don't you, Mickey?

633
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:03,011
Sergeant detective, organized crime
division. And these are my friends,

634
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:06,765
lieutenant Cabella
and captain McCann.

635
00:37:07,654 --> 00:37:09,016
Nice to meet you.

636
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,936
What the hell is going on here?

637
00:37:11,659 --> 00:37:14,480
Gentlemen,
I have a proposal for you.

638
00:37:14,779 --> 00:37:17,650
- Who the hell are you?
- Mickey, this is Jimmy Ford's son,

639
00:37:17,775 --> 00:37:18,604
Nate.

640
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:22,322
You anything like your father?

641
00:37:27,826 --> 00:37:29,376
What's your proposal?

642
00:37:30,044 --> 00:37:33,100
Okay, you let me and my friend
Doyle, in on your game,

643
00:37:33,225 --> 00:37:36,289
and I guarantee you he will leave
all his money on the table

644
00:37:36,414 --> 00:37:39,381
and confess to at least one felony,
probably more.

645
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,545
So you're telling me this Doyle kid's
gonna march right in here,

646
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,760
confess to a crime,
and give us all his money?

647
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:46,767
If all goes to plan.

648
00:37:47,868 --> 00:37:49,777
I don't know what kind
of schmuck would do that,

649
00:37:49,902 --> 00:37:51,894
but I'd sure as hell pay to see it.

650
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:53,979
This is entrapment.

651
00:37:54,328 --> 00:37:56,300
Entrapment? You think so?

652
00:37:57,259 --> 00:37:58,649
What do you think, captain?

653
00:37:58,774 --> 00:38:01,002
As I recall it,
I'm pretty sure he came in here,

654
00:38:01,127 --> 00:38:03,602
put his money on the table,
and asked into our game.

655
00:38:03,727 --> 00:38:05,277
And if memory serves,

656
00:38:05,854 --> 00:38:08,926
he confessed to being party
to that O'Hare job

657
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:10,787
down by the docks last year.

658
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,289
We're already making our mark.

659
00:38:13,553 --> 00:38:14,653
Like Mickey.

660
00:38:14,866 --> 00:38:17,543
You remember that deal went down
with the O'Hares last autumn?

661
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,254
- I remember it.
- You involved in that?

662
00:38:21,918 --> 00:38:23,368
You could say that.

663
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:26,653
That job would have been a mess
without me.

664
00:38:27,091 --> 00:38:31,058
It was me who suggested they use
cigar boxes instead of orange crates.

665
00:38:34,842 --> 00:38:37,542
First break we've had
on that case in months.

666
00:38:38,172 --> 00:38:40,422
All right. All right.
Fair enough.

667
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:45,549
How's about I walk away
with what's mine,

668
00:38:45,674 --> 00:38:47,774
you walk away with what's yours?

669
00:38:47,899 --> 00:38:49,318
And for your understanding,

670
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:51,787
I'll make a little contribution
to your retirement fund.

671
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:57,035
All right, now listen to me.
This is what you're gonna do.

672
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,359
You're gonna leave this bar,
you're gonna get out of town,

673
00:38:59,484 --> 00:39:02,501
you're gonna go home to daddy,
tell him that your business went bust.

674
00:39:02,626 --> 00:39:06,552
Or I will tell him that you gambled away
all his profits to a roomful of cops.

675
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,449
You will never set foot
in this town again,

676
00:39:08,574 --> 00:39:11,181
or they will throw your ass in jail.
Understood?

677
00:39:13,247 --> 00:39:14,997
Yeah, and one more thing.

678
00:39:18,427 --> 00:39:19,503
Get out of here.

679
00:39:26,345 --> 00:39:28,445
You're exactly like your father.

680
00:39:30,342 --> 00:39:31,942
So, I guess this is...

681
00:39:32,587 --> 00:39:33,787
All evidence?

682
00:39:34,287 --> 00:39:36,457
Never make it back
to the people it belongs to.

683
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:42,259
I don't know what
you're talking about.

684
00:39:42,384 --> 00:39:44,510
I've been at the movies
all night long.

685
00:39:44,635 --> 00:39:46,998
Me and Johnny here had tickets
to the game today.

686
00:39:48,288 --> 00:39:49,338
Great game.

687
00:39:52,136 --> 00:39:53,186
The ledger?

688
00:39:53,311 --> 00:39:56,161
Every name.
I mean, I'm still gonna take my...

689
00:39:56,286 --> 00:39:58,379
Yeah. Take your cut.
I'd expect nothing less.

690
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,486
- Take it.
- Oh, my god!

691
00:40:08,082 --> 00:40:10,907
I can't believe you actually
pulled this off in two hours.

692
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:12,985
Hour and a half.
I'm softening.

693
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,660
Definitely softening.

694
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:16,370
You guys get it squared away?

695
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:18,331
Yep.
Every last dollar.

696
00:40:18,456 --> 00:40:19,832
Every last one.

697
00:40:20,308 --> 00:40:21,458
On the house.

698
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:24,496
It's the least I can do.
You guys saved me today.

699
00:40:24,621 --> 00:40:26,566
All of us.
Thanks.

700
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:31,920
I'm kind of beat.
I'm gonna head upstairs.

701
00:40:32,045 --> 00:40:33,597
Wait, I'm sorry.
Wait, where?

702
00:40:34,088 --> 00:40:35,807
Upstairs, where I live.

703
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:38,228
Okay. Cool. That's cool.
Except how about this?

704
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,895
You stay down here a couple more hours,
get an appetizer...

705
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,335
- Cora, what's good on the menu?
- Calamari's really...

706
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,920
- Calamari?
- I don't really actually want calamari.

707
00:40:46,045 --> 00:40:48,143
- I want to go to bed.
- Cool. You can, in a minute.

708
00:40:48,268 --> 00:40:50,559
- Y'all want to help me?
- I ain't. This is your mess.

709
00:40:50,684 --> 00:40:52,108
What do you mean? 

710
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:54,242
What are you talking about?
What mess?

711
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:56,286
It's nothing. It's not a me...

712
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:58,789
- I don't clean. I'm going home.
- You don't clean?

713
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:01,534
- There's no maid service.
- If it was money, you'd swing that.

714
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:04,447
- I bet that much.
- I'm not doing it if she's not going!

715
00:41:04,572 --> 00:41:06,510
It was really nice
meeting you, Cora. You too.

716
00:41:06,635 --> 00:41:08,235
Thanks for everything.

717
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,066
He's the one you ought to thank.

718
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:17,182
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

719
00:41:17,432 --> 00:41:19,851
No. It was nothing.

720
00:41:21,598 --> 00:41:24,147
You remind me of your old man
sometimes.

721
00:41:24,604 --> 00:41:26,814
That's just an awful thing
to say to someone

722
00:41:26,939 --> 00:41:28,734
who has saved your ass today.
Come on.

723
00:41:29,464 --> 00:41:31,341
He has good qualities, Nate.

724
00:41:31,466 --> 00:41:33,781
You've just never been able
to see them.

725
00:41:34,475 --> 00:41:37,577
He uses people and takes advantage
of them. Come on, you know that.

726
00:41:39,105 --> 00:41:40,993
He takes care of his friends...

727
00:41:41,787 --> 00:41:42,887
Like you do.

728
00:41:44,655 --> 00:41:47,587
My dad would be really grateful
for what you did here today.

729
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:51,124
Your dad was a good man.

730
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,134
He was.

731
00:41:55,768 --> 00:41:57,597
But they all have their flaws.

732
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:08,992
To fathers.

733
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,078
To fathers.
