Season 3 Episode 9
<i>The Three-Card Monte Job</i>

2
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:12,836
I think he understands.

3
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:21,812
This is a bomb?

4
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,130
It's a phone.

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,300
Now you have two choices...

6
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,161
Either you do
what we're asking you to do,

7
00:00:27,286 --> 00:00:29,445
or I have to pay visit
to Natalia and little Sasha.

8
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:33,267
They go to school same way
every morning. Did you know this?

9
00:00:34,258 --> 00:00:35,368
Is not safe.

10
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:36,786
Anything.

11
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,721
- I'll do anything.
- What I'm asking for you to do is...

12
00:00:42,844 --> 00:00:44,046
Answer this phone.

13
00:00:45,321 --> 00:00:47,195
What are you supposed to do
when they call you?

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,670
I do whatever they ask.

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,730
Then destroy the phone,

16
00:00:51,255 --> 00:00:53,761
and tell no one,
or they'll kill my children.

17
00:00:55,274 --> 00:00:57,645
You install and repair
telephone lines for a living?

18
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:58,920
For 10 years.

19
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:02,434
I have three major contracts
right now.

20
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,859
If I'm arrested,

21
00:01:04,124 --> 00:01:05,189
it all goes away.

22
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:08,082
And you have no idea
why they specifically targeted you?

23
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:12,135
I'm not perfect,
but I try to be a good man.

24
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,863
My parents came to Boston
to get away from this kind of thing...

25
00:01:15,988 --> 00:01:17,535
Russians hurting Russians.

26
00:01:18,114 --> 00:01:19,745
And if you contacted the police?

27
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,443
The Russians will know.
They say they're watching.

28
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:26,672
This bar, I've been here before.
It's probably safe.

29
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:28,053
And you...

30
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:31,173
- You're no cop.
- No. I'm no cop.

31
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:32,925
Cloned.

32
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,947
This phone rings,
I want you to answer it.

33
00:01:36,484 --> 00:01:38,723
- We'll contact you.
- Thank you, Mr. Ford.

34
00:01:39,415 --> 00:01:41,517
We're not gonna let anything bad
happen to your family.

35
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:42,685
Thank you.

36
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,149
Okay, now, I put a tap on the phone,
So if that thing rings, we'll know it.

37
00:01:48,921 --> 00:01:49,942
Good. What else?

38
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,577
There's one incoming call.

39
00:01:52,578 --> 00:01:54,007
These guys were thorough.

40
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:56,657
They wanted to make sure if they called,
Andrei would answer.

41
00:01:56,782 --> 00:01:59,410
- Yeah, they call it once to test it.
- Exactly.

42
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,080
So if we just call them back...

43
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:06,643
You going to get that?

44
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:16,929
This is Pieter.

45
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:18,577
Hello?

46
00:02:21,264 --> 00:02:22,266
Marco.

47
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,809
Polo.

48
00:02:34,573 --> 00:02:36,405
- You sure this is the place?
- <i>I'm sorry,</i>

49
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,573
am I sure?

50
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:40,576
Eliot, what is that Russian carrying?
It's called a smartphone.

51
00:02:40,876 --> 00:02:43,227
Smartphones read e-mails,
they have GPS maps,

52
00:02:43,352 --> 00:02:46,559
They link to an atomic clock on
this little thing called the Internet.

53
00:02:46,684 --> 00:02:50,406
You ever heard of it?
A smartphone has an operating system.

54
00:02:50,531 --> 00:02:52,755
If it has an operating system,
you know I can hack it.

55
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,889
Think I may have just ID'd
our bad guy.

56
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,808
His name is Pieter Volokh.

57
00:03:05,464 --> 00:03:07,807
Him and his crew,
they used to belong to the M-45s,

58
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,215
ex-military hitters
turned mafia boys.

59
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,901
Now, they took a big hit
in a bust last month.

60
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:18,072
They lost $20 million
in merchandise to the police.

61
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:19,782
That's gotta hurt.

62
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,452
<i>We know what they're after.
They're looking for a big-payout job,</i>

63
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,407
so that they can
get back on their feet.

64
00:03:25,532 --> 00:03:26,966
Now, I've ID'd the perp,

65
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:29,200
I know what they want,
and I know why.

66
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:31,627
What did you do with your afternoon?

67
00:03:32,122 --> 00:03:34,421
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
when I get back there.

68
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:53,816
Think he's involved?

69
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,777
It's Russian mafia.

70
00:03:57,713 --> 00:03:59,572
They wear their tattoos
like a résumé.

71
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:01,490
See that cathedral on his neck?

72
00:04:02,065 --> 00:04:04,059
Three spires, three tours in prison.

73
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,705
The stars on his arm
means he's a Captain.

74
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,332
- So he's the boss?
- <i>I don't know. Probably.</i>

75
00:04:10,845 --> 00:04:13,347
I ran into some of these cats
in Petrozavodsk.

76
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,857
They blackmail
innocent people like Andrei

77
00:04:16,982 --> 00:04:19,438
into committing crimes
and dropping off money.

78
00:04:20,112 --> 00:04:23,178
Then those guys get picked up
by the cops or they end up dead.

79
00:04:23,494 --> 00:04:24,594
It's brutal.

80
00:04:25,463 --> 00:04:26,657
Want me to taser him?

81
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:29,002
No tasering, Parker.
Not yet, anyway.

82
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:31,353
- <i>Are they still in sight?</i>
- I hate this kind of criminal.

83
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,689
What were you doing
when I chased you?

84
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,973
I stole art from rich people
who could afford it.

85
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:37,860
These guys?
They terrorize their victims,

86
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:40,237
they harm families,
and the worst part?

87
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,370
They make innocent people
commit crimes.

88
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:43,980
That's the worst part?

89
00:04:44,105 --> 00:04:46,304
You blackmail an innocent man
into breaking the law,

90
00:04:46,429 --> 00:04:49,418
the rest of his life he's gonna feel
shame over how you made him helpless,

91
00:04:49,543 --> 00:04:51,638
or guilt over what you made him do.

92
00:04:51,763 --> 00:04:53,013
We chose crime.

93
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,752
Andrei didn't.

94
00:05:00,577 --> 00:05:01,592
Hurry up!

95
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:05,304
I hurried! Then I hurried again!
I checked it three times. It's clean.

96
00:05:05,744 --> 00:05:06,680
Check it again.

97
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:17,608
What are you doing?

98
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,880
- You don't throw crowbars at people!
- Sorry!

99
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:44,134
"You don't throw crowbars at people!"
Could have just tasered him.

100
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:46,592
Promise me we're gonna
take these guys down hard.

101
00:05:46,717 --> 00:05:48,138
I promise. Where are they going?

102
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,391
I want this to be exciting
and dramatic.

103
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:54,311
It's already exciting. Look.
They reversed the phone tap. We're blown.

104
00:05:55,296 --> 00:05:57,231
They're gonna kill Hardison.

105
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,483
They're gonna kill who?
No, they ain't!

106
00:06:00,211 --> 00:06:02,403
I bet you they ain't!
Nate, you better stall!

107
00:06:02,937 --> 00:06:03,737
Come on.

108
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:16,333
Wait a minute.

109
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,128
My only way out is the front door.
Are they coming through there?

110
00:06:19,573 --> 00:06:21,505
- I don't know.
- <i>What you mean you don't know?</i>

111
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,507
You better say something.
I swear on my mama,

112
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:27,261
I will blow a hole through your bedroom.
Tell me something.

113
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,550
We'll tell you something
in a second, Hardison.

114
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:31,496
We're coming through the back door.

115
00:06:39,995 --> 00:06:40,995
What?

116
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:43,367
- You're not gonna like this.
- What?

117
00:06:48,205 --> 00:06:50,505
Somebody's been eating our porridge.

118
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,799
You don't have to be
so rough with him...

119
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:10,304
Hold on, Hardison.
They're not here for you.

120
00:07:11,972 --> 00:07:13,081
Yeah, I knew it.

121
00:07:14,832 --> 00:07:17,257
Nobody can reverse my phone taps.
Come on, man.

122
00:07:17,691 --> 00:07:19,563
I don't see why y'all
were getting all excited.

123
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,991
All right, I'll do whatever you say.

124
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:24,165
I still have the phone!

125
00:07:25,182 --> 00:07:28,140
- What else do you want from me?
- The red phone again.

126
00:07:28,988 --> 00:07:30,804
Nate, this guy's not our boss.

127
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:33,744
- He's another blackmail victim.
- <i>Yes, I know.</i>

128
00:07:34,408 --> 00:07:36,003
I'm about to meet their boss.

129
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,050
Go on.

130
00:07:47,476 --> 00:07:48,592
Hello, dad.

131
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,693
Give me a moment.
I want a word with my son.

132
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:08,153
Go on.

133
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:15,285
I got out a while ago.

134
00:08:15,707 --> 00:08:17,329
Yeah, I know.
I knew you were out.

135
00:08:17,894 --> 00:08:20,791
I didn't see you at the prison gates
waiting to pick me up.

136
00:08:21,146 --> 00:08:23,418
Yeah, I was visiting mom's grave.

137
00:08:26,364 --> 00:08:29,282
So, what's a washed-up bookie
like yourself

138
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:31,344
doing with a Russian
blackmailing crew?

139
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,645
I went to prison
'cause I took the fall...

140
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:35,741
for the three families.

141
00:08:36,805 --> 00:08:39,685
I did my time for them
like a stand-up guy.

142
00:08:40,135 --> 00:08:42,938
- You heard what happened.
- It was on the news.

143
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,567
- Artie Van, he turned state's evidence.
- Turned state's evidence...

144
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,380
Gave up his ledger.
20 years of payoffs...

145
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:53,337
The McTeagues, the O'Hares,
the Donnellys...

146
00:08:53,462 --> 00:08:55,576
All the big families
are going down by law.

147
00:08:56,332 --> 00:08:57,870
Now, once upon a time,

148
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,123
they would take care of someone
who's gone inside for them.

149
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:03,584
I went to jail for nothing.

150
00:09:04,382 --> 00:09:05,544
I want to get my piece.

151
00:09:07,398 --> 00:09:10,716
With these guys?
These guys that threaten children?

152
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:14,475
- What?
- You thought you were smarter than me,

153
00:09:15,351 --> 00:09:16,597
brighter, better than me.

154
00:09:17,887 --> 00:09:20,649
Everybody in the neighborhood
always treated me with respect,

155
00:09:20,774 --> 00:09:22,978
- but my own son...
- What did you do to respect, exactly?

156
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,207
My son, my altar-boy son.

157
00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:27,435
Listen to you.

158
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:32,029
Never broke the law,
you never broke a rule.

159
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,823
Look at you now. You're a thief.
You've done time.

160
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,679
If you know where I've been,

161
00:09:37,316 --> 00:09:39,323
then you know
that this is my town now.

162
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,726
And I don't want
you running game in it.

163
00:09:42,851 --> 00:09:46,295
All your life you thought
you were better than me.

164
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,920
Now you're trying to be me?

165
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:50,626
You can't be me.

166
00:09:51,344 --> 00:09:53,484
You don't have the stones for that.

167
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:56,048
You're not tough enough.
You're not ruthless enough.

168
00:09:56,173 --> 00:09:58,347
You don't have what it takes.

169
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:02,809
You remember the first time
I brought you into my office?

170
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,414
Queen and her court.

171
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:09,971
Got that? Watching?

172
00:10:10,096 --> 00:10:12,819
Keep your eye on this.
It's the lady.

173
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:14,947
Now, pay attention.

174
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:16,414
Which one?

175
00:10:19,772 --> 00:10:21,370
You still don't get it, do you?

176
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:24,915
You got to think this through, kid.
You're just never gonna get it.

177
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:28,915
You weren't good enough
to know what I was doing then

178
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,506
and you ain't good enough
to know what I'm doing now.

179
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:37,010
By the way, I'm setting up
in my old workshop in the back there.

180
00:10:37,314 --> 00:10:39,596
I'll be out by this weekend,
so don't worry about it.

181
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,050
Okay. Run it.

182
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,590
Go ahead. Run it.

183
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,823
You know what?
Maybe we should just discuss first.

184
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,742
- They feel weird going after your dad.
- Well, I don't.

185
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,897
Come on. Run it.
Jimmy Ford.

186
00:11:03,717 --> 00:11:05,367
Hardison, tell us about Jimmy Ford.

187
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:07,421
All right.

188
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,049
Jimmy Ford.
Jimmy... your pop.

189
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,851
He wore a lot of criminal hats, man.

190
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:21,130
But he was well-known
in the neighborhood.

191
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:22,472
I think people liked him.

192
00:11:23,261 --> 00:11:26,184
- He helped some people get some money.
- Forget it.

193
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:29,941
Come on, you can't sugarcoat it.
You got to tell it like it is, all right?

194
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:33,962
Jimmy Ford, he started off as a bookie
who worked for the McTeagues.

195
00:11:34,087 --> 00:11:36,028
He ran every bet
this side of Atlantic city.

196
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:38,677
Once he had a fair amount
of honest citizens in his debt,

197
00:11:38,802 --> 00:11:41,684
he made the transition
into being a loan shark.

198
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:43,657
Now, he used those contacts
to become a fixer.

199
00:11:43,782 --> 00:11:46,151
So what he'd do is he'd take
a bad guy that needed a job

200
00:11:46,276 --> 00:11:48,457
and a boss who needed a henchman,
match them together.

201
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:50,171
That...

202
00:11:50,296 --> 00:11:53,712
That's Jimmy Ford at his peak.
King of the neighborhood.

203
00:11:54,051 --> 00:11:57,174
I don't know how this ties in with
the whole cellphone/blackmail thing.

204
00:11:57,853 --> 00:12:01,089
We've got multiple victims.
Andrei, the telephone repair guy.

205
00:12:01,214 --> 00:12:03,627
- Eliot's friend Simakov.
- What does he do?

206
00:12:03,752 --> 00:12:07,220
Shipping. Industrial clothing, uniforms.
Nothing remarkable.

207
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:08,852
Then, following Pieter's phone,

208
00:12:09,423 --> 00:12:11,730
- we found a third red phone.
- That's a dead end.

209
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,649
We don't know who this guy is
or why the Russians want him.

210
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:18,128
He's not gonna talk to us 'cause Pieter's
boys already put the fear of God in him.

211
00:12:18,253 --> 00:12:19,669
What is Jimmy's game?

212
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:24,834
I would imagine he has a chess board
set up in the back room.

213
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,119
Looks a lot like yours.

214
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:29,081
No, dad doesn't like chess.
No, his game is three-card Monte.

215
00:12:30,177 --> 00:12:31,479
Just keep the cards moving.

216
00:12:31,604 --> 00:12:34,105
Don't show you the queen
until he wants you to see the queen.

217
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:35,755
All right, so,

218
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:38,503
we don't have enough information
to run a con on this guy.

219
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:41,815
Not yet, anyway.
So, why don't we just sit this one out?

220
00:12:42,705 --> 00:12:45,196
No, we're gonna keep at this.
We're gonna gather information.

221
00:12:45,321 --> 00:12:48,390
Let me be a bit clearer...
Why don't you sit this one out?

222
00:12:48,515 --> 00:12:51,722
You want us to go after the bad guys,
we're gonna go after the bad guys!

223
00:12:51,847 --> 00:12:53,479
And we're gonna go after them hard!

224
00:12:53,826 --> 00:12:55,065
Yeah, right.

225
00:12:56,168 --> 00:12:58,368
I said:
"Let's go after the bad guys."

226
00:12:58,493 --> 00:12:59,820
But not Jimmy Ford.

227
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:03,657
You honestly think that you can put
your own father behind bars?

228
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:05,619
You got to stop looking at him
as my father.

229
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:08,010
He's a mark like any other mark.
He's hurting people.

230
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,188
We can do this. It's what we do.
It's our job to go after the bad guys.

231
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:13,956
It's not your job
to take down your own father.

232
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:15,515
No. It's my pleasure.

233
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,587
Hey, guys,
Andrei, our first victim...

234
00:13:18,552 --> 00:13:20,757
- He just got a call.
- Okay. Let's go.

235
00:13:25,753 --> 00:13:28,459
Andrei's scared, but he's told us
what they've asked him to do.

236
00:13:28,584 --> 00:13:30,546
He's been tapped
because of his access.

237
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:32,379
He's supposed
to get into the precinct

238
00:13:32,504 --> 00:13:35,104
on one of his routine maintenance calls
and install a black box.

239
00:13:35,229 --> 00:13:37,774
With that,
the Russians can spoof phone calls

240
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,431
off the hardwired phone trunk.

241
00:13:39,556 --> 00:13:42,571
- Can you turn it off remotely?
- Too antiquated for a digital hack.

242
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:46,577
So Jimmy can control which alarms
reach the precinct and which don't.

243
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:48,712
Like silent alarms? From banks?

244
00:13:48,998 --> 00:13:50,787
Or any building
with a high security system.

245
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,980
So if we can't hack it,
how do we stop him, then?

246
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,854
We mustn't stop him.

247
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:58,047
If Andrei doesn't do what they say,
then they're gonna go after his family.

248
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:01,298
All right, so we don't stop him.

249
00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:03,311
We help him.

250
00:14:22,723 --> 00:14:23,723
What?

251
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,948
Hey, bartender!
Get me a drink!

252
00:14:27,255 --> 00:14:28,305
Quiet down.

253
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,496
Detective Moffat. Detective Davies.
We're with district eight.

254
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,705
What do you got?

255
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,134
Who the hell are you, cupcake?

256
00:14:37,556 --> 00:14:40,295
You want to know who I am?
I'm Viola.

257
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,299
- Viola Dagostino of...
- Of the Dagostinos.

258
00:14:44,908 --> 00:14:47,780
We got her husband, we got a brother,
and both uncles up at eight.

259
00:14:47,905 --> 00:14:51,258
Got her on a drunk and disorderly,
that's not gonna keep her away for long,

260
00:14:51,383 --> 00:14:53,365
we got to store her somewhere
away from the press.

261
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,143
Yeah, I got you.
Let me call it in.

262
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:00,148
Incoming.

263
00:15:02,862 --> 00:15:04,412
Eighth district here.

264
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,073
She's a handful.

265
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:09,866
One little drink.

266
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,370
You're good. Just take her downstairs
to the drunk tank. It's empty.

267
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:15,189
Gotcha.

268
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:25,203
Come on!

269
00:15:26,362 --> 00:15:27,419
Make it snappy!

270
00:15:27,544 --> 00:15:30,345
Being handcuffed in a police station is
a recurring bloody nightmare of mine.

271
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,097
How do we look?

272
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:35,133
This baby's a lot more sensitive
than what Andrei has access to.

273
00:15:35,826 --> 00:15:38,245
See, we can block alarms,

274
00:15:39,242 --> 00:15:40,458
we can trigger alarms,

275
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,694
but most importantly,
we can track alarms.

276
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:44,442
It should be synchronized.
Nate?

277
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,529
All right, we're good.

278
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,657
Let's get the hell out of here, then.
Sophie?

279
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,049
My exit is with Parker.

280
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:54,663
See you on the outside, cupcakes.

281
00:15:59,244 --> 00:16:00,444
Where's he at?

282
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,358
- He's gone!
- Lucille! Lucille 2.0!

283
00:16:03,636 --> 00:16:06,436
- He's off comms.
- He's off the reservation.

284
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:10,998
I know what he's up to.

285
00:16:12,725 --> 00:16:13,975
You interfered.

286
00:16:15,093 --> 00:16:16,680
How unlike you.

287
00:16:16,805 --> 00:16:18,787
Where I come from,
this is not tolerated.

288
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:21,563
We're nowhere near
where you come from, so just shut up.

289
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:25,032
Let me tell you what I did.

290
00:16:25,157 --> 00:16:28,614
I know what you did.
You let our repairman loose.

291
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,584
This repairman was a liability.
He could've panicked,

292
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:35,118
or he could've tipped off
any of those cops at the precinct.

293
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,895
I mean, he's not like us.

294
00:16:40,143 --> 00:16:41,143
Us?

295
00:16:42,746 --> 00:16:43,746
Us. Yeah.

296
00:16:45,356 --> 00:16:47,954
You know, using a civilian
was a brute-force move,

297
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,592
but let me show you
a more elegant way of doing...

298
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,719
No, that's all right. I'm just...

299
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,707
I'm getting a remote-control device
out of my pocket, fellas.

300
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:57,832
All right?

301
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,674
I want to show you a more elegant way
of doing business with this remote.

302
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:04,319
You have much finer control
over your phone lines

303
00:17:04,444 --> 00:17:05,899
than you could ever hope for.

304
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:09,061
Now, this is an unexpected gift
from you, my son.

305
00:17:10,435 --> 00:17:12,454
Thank you very much.
Now you can go.

306
00:17:14,676 --> 00:17:16,621
Only I control the box.

307
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:20,227
You try to take this from me,
I will destroy the black box. I will.

308
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:22,999
All right?
I'll do it remotely.

309
00:17:24,238 --> 00:17:27,097
- Didn't see this coming.
- Like I said, this is my town now.

310
00:17:27,222 --> 00:17:29,332
You want to pull a job this big
in my town...

311
00:17:30,304 --> 00:17:31,304
I want in.

312
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:43,061
- He's setting us up for the cops.
- I just got out of prison.

313
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,412
You escaped.
And yet, you do not run. Why is this?

314
00:17:45,537 --> 00:17:48,285
Because you are,
how do you say, a narc.

315
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,766
If you'd done your homework,
you'd know that I set up a warden,

316
00:17:50,891 --> 00:17:53,613
brought him down, and got myself
a free pass at the same time.

317
00:17:54,486 --> 00:17:55,740
Nobody could do this.

318
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,269
I did from inside a prison.

319
00:17:57,394 --> 00:17:59,828
Now, if I can do that,
think what I could do for you.

320
00:18:00,743 --> 00:18:01,663
Or to you.

321
00:18:04,996 --> 00:18:08,628
Carrot in one hand, stick in the other.
That's a hard way to come at them.

322
00:18:09,036 --> 00:18:10,588
I learned from the best.

323
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:21,049
He's in.

324
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,342
What's the plan?

325
00:18:30,685 --> 00:18:31,685
All right.

326
00:18:32,157 --> 00:18:33,290
Pay attention.

327
00:18:35,257 --> 00:18:36,322
I don't like you.

328
00:18:36,713 --> 00:18:40,201
Gee, does that mean I can't come to
your birthday party and ride the pony?

329
00:18:49,335 --> 00:18:52,221
First Boston independent,
state street branch of the Boston bank,

330
00:18:52,346 --> 00:18:54,820
Commonwealth loan and securities.
Now...

331
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,552
First independents got
a Glenn-reeder alarm system,

332
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,958
series f-900.
Two guards in the front,

333
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:02,451
ne guard in the back.
Cameras record...

334
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:04,809
not monitored.
Daily turnover... $2 million.

335
00:19:05,622 --> 00:19:07,920
State street,
mostly commercial papers and loans,

336
00:19:08,045 --> 00:19:10,607
but they do have bearer bonds
in a basement lock down room.

337
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,519
Just takes a key and a retina scanner.
Commonwealth...

338
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,452
Their alarm system's a holdover
from the '70s, but...

339
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:20,241
But it's...

340
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:23,293
What?

341
00:19:25,592 --> 00:19:27,290
What do you do on your weekends?

342
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,001
There's something wrong with you.

343
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:32,295
So, which one's he gonna hit?

344
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:34,595
- None of them?
- None of them.

345
00:19:35,923 --> 00:19:39,245
But, see, since we control
the precinct alarm system,

346
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,051
the cops are gonna think
they're being robbed.

347
00:19:42,176 --> 00:19:43,473
Think of this, Nathan.

348
00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:47,393
Three banks being robbed
at the same time.

349
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:49,479
They're gonna think it's Armageddon.

350
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:53,066
Every cop in town Is gonna be
heading towards those three banks.

351
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:55,944
And away from...?

352
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,072
- Away from what?
- I don't know.

353
00:19:59,587 --> 00:20:01,939
He won't tell me.
He won't tell me yet.

354
00:20:02,064 --> 00:20:04,313
You realize how many banks
there are South of the precinct?

355
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:05,438
67.

356
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:09,328
You keep your eye on the queen.

357
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,753
You learn this, you'll be in good stead.
Pay attention.

358
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,424
Are you watching at all?

359
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,885
That's the best you can do?

360
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,721
It's not the best you can do.
What, are you being a wise guy?

361
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,764
Okay, guys,
it's three-card Monte, see?

362
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,396
We got to find the red queen.
We got too many cards in play.

363
00:20:31,962 --> 00:20:34,566
- There's still the third phone.
- That's for you and Eliot.

364
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,985
You're gonna find the guy,
get his story.

365
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,612
Sophie, downstairs, that equipment
in the back is used for the job.

366
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,793
Go get a look.

367
00:20:40,918 --> 00:20:42,699
I'll take Parker.
What you gonna do?

368
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,603
I'm gonna go get my father
to trust me enough

369
00:20:45,728 --> 00:20:47,328
to tell me the whole plan.

370
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,394
I'm gonna go help him plan
a bank robbery.

371
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:55,003
That's George Pimsleur.
Works at Hancock alarm security,

372
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,237
And in that briefcase is a binder,
with all the schematics and codes

373
00:20:58,362 --> 00:21:00,423
of all the alarm systems
they installed,

374
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:02,842
Including the alarm system
on our real target.

375
00:21:02,967 --> 00:21:03,970
Which is what?

376
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,347
My boys kick his teeth in,

377
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:09,660
they take his wallet,
his briefcase, watch, maybe...

378
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:12,437
And over in five minutes.

379
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,118
Well, we could.

380
00:21:14,352 --> 00:21:17,728
Or we could take what we want,
and the mark never knows he's been hit.

381
00:21:20,123 --> 00:21:22,447
- How many men?
- Two. You and me.

382
00:21:26,907 --> 00:21:28,225
What are we doing?

383
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,844
You got to limp.

384
00:21:30,683 --> 00:21:32,523
- Which leg?
- Your left leg.

385
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:34,746
We're gonna do the pill scam.

386
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:35,877
There you go.

387
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,274
Excuse me, sir?

388
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:41,422
I'm sorry to bother you.
Do you have change for a $20?

389
00:21:41,547 --> 00:21:43,869
The machine's broke over here.
I got to get my car out.

390
00:21:43,994 --> 00:21:45,887
Got to get my dad to dialysis.

391
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,007
- Sure. Hang on.
- Thank you so much.

392
00:21:53,008 --> 00:21:55,396
Those are so expensive.
I appreciate your...

393
00:21:56,057 --> 00:21:59,248
My mom's got heart trouble.
These damn pills cost a fortune, I know.

394
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,230
There's one over there, too.

395
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:07,212
I sure appreciate that.
You all right there, dad?

396
00:22:08,235 --> 00:22:10,467
- Yeah, feel just fine.
- We're almost...

397
00:22:10,592 --> 00:22:12,580
Your mother...
Would be very proud of you.

398
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:14,207
No problem, sir.

399
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:16,834
- You both take care now.
- Nice of the guy.

400
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,881
- That's not bad.
- Thank you.

401
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:20,964
- It worked out, didn't it?
- My little boy.

402
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,575
Hardison got background on Pieter.

403
00:22:38,134 --> 00:22:41,095
Ex-soviet army,
three counts armed robbery.

404
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,385
I want the good stuff.
Give it to me.

405
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:47,240
He's from Lipetsk.
That is close to Penza.

406
00:22:47,635 --> 00:22:49,388
And his mother's name is Rada.

407
00:22:49,513 --> 00:22:51,740
So what are we thinking?
The Berlin shuffle?

408
00:22:51,865 --> 00:22:53,842
- Little orphan Annie.
- Excuse me.

409
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,202
- Need this?
- Thanks, Parker.

410
00:23:08,144 --> 00:23:10,013
- You cannot come in here!
- Sorry.

411
00:23:19,227 --> 00:23:20,392
You're Russian?

412
00:23:23,182 --> 00:23:26,320
That was something
my father used to say. Is it bad?

413
00:23:26,602 --> 00:23:29,313
No, it's not so bad.
Your parents are Russian?

414
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,099
Yeah, from...

415
00:23:33,248 --> 00:23:34,078
Penzo?

416
00:23:34,402 --> 00:23:36,372
Penza!
I'm from Lipetsk.

417
00:23:36,776 --> 00:23:38,666
- What is your name?
- Rada.

418
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:40,960
This is my mother's name... Rada.

419
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:42,211
Shut up!

420
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:45,214
I wish I did speak some Russian.
My mom and dad died

421
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,842
when I was just a kid,
she didn't want me speaking it, so...

422
00:23:48,267 --> 00:23:50,386
And for you to say "my name's Rada,"

423
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,842
<i>Menya zovut rada.</i>

424
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:53,726
No, you got to go slower.

425
00:23:54,662 --> 00:23:57,112
<i>Mañana</i>... no!
That's Spanish!

426
00:24:04,035 --> 00:24:07,278
Next red phone is right ahead.
We just got to figure out who has it.

427
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,878
- How you doing?
- What are you doing back here?

428
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,790
I think you are holding a gun
that was tagged in a case we caught.

429
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,125
Let me get you one here.
This is the best coffee.

430
00:24:21,696 --> 00:24:24,299
You want to get in there before
the shift changes. 'cause that evidence.

431
00:24:24,424 --> 00:24:26,714
That ships out to Holyoke
first thing tomorrow.

432
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:30,266
- This a drive you do not want to make.
- I don't want to make that drive.

433
00:24:30,391 --> 00:24:31,594
Thank you so much.

434
00:24:31,996 --> 00:24:34,272
Good to see you.
Thank you so much for this.

435
00:24:35,696 --> 00:24:37,424
You sure that's the same red phone?

436
00:24:38,647 --> 00:24:41,604
Is it me or does this make less sense
every time we find something out?

437
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,549
Pretty much.

438
00:24:46,439 --> 00:24:47,443
It sure is.

439
00:24:49,118 --> 00:24:52,003
You were supposed to call us!
To hit the alarm man.

440
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,220
Well, Nathan here... He took care of it
with a little soft touch.

441
00:25:06,275 --> 00:25:08,159
- You can go.
- I'm not going anywhere.

442
00:25:08,284 --> 00:25:09,988
He says I'm in, I'm in.

443
00:25:10,878 --> 00:25:13,010
I am so sick
of this idea about you...

444
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:16,180
Stop waving that gun in my face.

445
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,974
You're so tough, prove it.

446
00:25:19,356 --> 00:25:21,469
Go on in there.
Come on. I got your back.

447
00:25:21,594 --> 00:25:22,765
Thanks, dad.

448
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,394
We don't have to do this.
It's all right.

449
00:25:35,362 --> 00:25:37,827
"Stop waving a gun in my face
and prove it."

450
00:25:40,295 --> 00:25:42,149
I had to have it out with the guy.

451
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,876
I'd rather he punch me in the face
than shoot me in the back.

452
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,332
No.
You really went at it back there.

453
00:25:47,457 --> 00:25:50,302
What was it you used say to me?
"You're too much of a thinker, Nathan.

454
00:25:50,427 --> 00:25:52,967
You need to be more
of a scrapper to survive."

455
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,927
Well, I'm never wrong.

456
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,596
That, too, you used to always say.

457
00:26:02,454 --> 00:26:03,815
I gotta tell you,

458
00:26:04,055 --> 00:26:06,679
I doubted your intentions
when you came to join this lot.

459
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:09,192
Join this lot? No.
Joining you.

460
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,028
You.

461
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,871
These guys,
they're a dime a dozen, pop.

462
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,243
But that dime a dozen are getting
tougher every year, ain't it?

463
00:26:20,327 --> 00:26:23,122
What do you hope to get out
of this plan you're cooking up?

464
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:25,303
Without giving you any particulars,

465
00:26:25,428 --> 00:26:27,627
I plan to make
a small fortune out of this.

466
00:26:28,091 --> 00:26:30,083
Wait. So one last job?

467
00:26:30,453 --> 00:26:32,131
If there's enough money in it, yeah.

468
00:26:32,664 --> 00:26:34,717
- And then?
- Get on a boat.

469
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:37,345
Go back to where
your grandfather came from.

470
00:26:38,703 --> 00:26:41,348
Used to got some pretty cousins
back there.

471
00:26:43,178 --> 00:26:44,473
All right, so...

472
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:47,355
This big last score,

473
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,655
and the great Jimmy Ford, what,

474
00:26:49,894 --> 00:26:52,142
goes to Ireland to retire?

475
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,070
That's quite a picture.

476
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:57,281
You ever wish ma was joining you?

477
00:26:58,936 --> 00:27:01,517
She didn't really understand me.

478
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:06,069
But she loved me.

479
00:27:07,005 --> 00:27:08,628
That's more important.

480
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:18,386
You were up late.

481
00:27:18,827 --> 00:27:20,994
I was out trying to get information
from my dad.

482
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,013
Good. So you know
what bank he's gonna hit, then.

483
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:26,898
- Today's the day.
- I know.

484
00:27:29,054 --> 00:27:32,733
This would be really hard on anyone.
You don't have to do this.

485
00:27:33,323 --> 00:27:34,368
Yes, I do.

486
00:27:34,956 --> 00:27:36,393
I'm the only one who can.

487
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:44,241
All right, dear old dad,
you're now gonna tell me everything,

488
00:27:44,366 --> 00:27:45,581
because I...

489
00:27:59,621 --> 00:28:01,679
All right, go on in there.
I got your back.

490
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,139
Thanks, dad.

491
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:05,308
There you go.

492
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,151
Nate, what's the deal?

493
00:28:15,478 --> 00:28:18,342
He cleared out. They're on the job,
and we have no idea what the job is.

494
00:28:18,467 --> 00:28:21,032
- We got the two guys...
- We have no idea what he's doing.

495
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,744
Look what I found in the alley.

496
00:28:32,757 --> 00:28:34,760
Great.
A map that we've seen before.

497
00:28:34,885 --> 00:28:37,766
This is not her fault. You're the one
who let your dad walk out of here.

498
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:40,017
- We got our room back.
- Nate, the plans you got

499
00:28:40,142 --> 00:28:42,620
were from the Hancock alarm company.
We just need Hardison

500
00:28:42,745 --> 00:28:45,288
to figure out How many banks
in this radius have got Hancock alarms.

501
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:46,265
23.

502
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,811
Assuming it is a bank.

503
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:50,728
I don't know what you would be doing
with one of these in a bank.

504
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,004
It's the same one that Parker saw
in Pieter's bag. A bar-code scanner.

505
00:28:54,129 --> 00:28:56,817
It scans a bar-code label
and compares it to a remote database.

506
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,486
But what are they doing with it?

507
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,591
We still got the coffee guy in play.

508
00:29:00,716 --> 00:29:02,083
What's he up to?

509
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:07,036
It's a lot of cops, man.
Maybe he's drugging them.

510
00:29:07,465 --> 00:29:09,741
- Slows down response time.
- That's a good idea.

511
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,750
You think he'd drug
the whole precinct? Come on!

512
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:18,506
You're not paying attention.
Pay attention.

513
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,467
Are you watching at all?

514
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,594
We got the lady here.

515
00:29:23,886 --> 00:29:24,887
Which one?

516
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,808
We got to start all over again?
Pay attention.

517
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:30,245
Think about it.

518
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,105
You're never gonna get this, are you?
You're just never gonna get it.

519
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:37,108
These are not queens! You understand me?
Don't get me pissed off!

520
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,902
Does it look like there's a queen
in there?

521
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,114
You're never gonna get this, are you?
You can't figure that out for yourself?

522
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,494
I want an answer.

523
00:29:46,258 --> 00:29:47,826
I know where he's going.

524
00:29:50,444 --> 00:29:53,582
What's the trick to three-card Monte?
The queen's never even on the table.

525
00:29:54,462 --> 00:29:56,008
It's not a bank.
Hardison,

526
00:29:56,133 --> 00:29:58,754
where do the police keep evidence,
the really valuable stuff?

527
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,674
that ships out to Holyoke
first thing tomorrow.

528
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,400
In the district,
then they transfer it out.

529
00:30:05,413 --> 00:30:06,513
Russians.

530
00:30:09,668 --> 00:30:10,887
The Russians.

531
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,436
Remember that big bust last month?

532
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,022
They lost $20 million in merchandise
to the police.

533
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,357
That's gotta hurt.

534
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,152
They got to get drugs, guns,
and $20 million.

535
00:30:21,978 --> 00:30:23,317
It's on the move.

536
00:30:24,253 --> 00:30:25,030
Today.

537
00:30:25,462 --> 00:30:26,693
That's correct.

538
00:30:27,561 --> 00:30:29,521
Ready to get out of here, boys?

539
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:33,844
- Come on, guys. Let's go.
- All right.

540
00:30:44,483 --> 00:30:47,219
We got a silent alarm call
at First Boston Independent.

541
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:53,976
We got another alarm call.

542
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,895
This one is at Boston bank at state.

543
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,315
We got a third one!
It's Commonwealth.

544
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:01,433
Dispatch,
this is district nine duty.

545
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:03,949
We have got multiple code ones
at the following sites...

546
00:31:04,074 --> 00:31:06,655
- Get some backup to the cruisers.
- Who do I bring?

547
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,925
- Get everybody out there!
- Come on, let's go!

548
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:11,452
I need every available unit rolling now.
First Boston,

549
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,330
Boston bank state street,
Commonwealth Loan and securities.

550
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:36,646
- You okay?
- I can't seem to keep my eyes open.

551
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,815
I can't get any confirmation.
I told you, Boston bank,

552
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,863
First Boston independent,
and Commonwealth.

553
00:31:49,988 --> 00:31:52,498
- Evidence transfer?
- Yeah, you're good.

554
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:55,287
I just need bodies out there.
Get the 2nd, the 4th,

555
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,924
the 10th districts over there.

556
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:06,618
If they wake up...

557
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,604
Kill them.

558
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,144
You know the plan.

559
00:32:19,511 --> 00:32:21,514
Run and hack at the same time...
sure.

560
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:24,084
Wait a second.
Let's go over this, all right? Stop.

561
00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:26,687
Why don't you tell
the cops everything?

562
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:29,405
- The Russians could start shooting.
- There's enough cops to handle.

563
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:31,493
We stick to the plan,
the Russians will go down.

564
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:32,767
And your father.

565
00:32:33,464 --> 00:32:37,121
I've got him. I want to look him
in the eye when I put him down.

566
00:32:43,487 --> 00:32:45,850
- You're expecting us.
- Where's your transfer order?

567
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:47,875
- That's it.
- Let me see that.

568
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:51,890
All right.

569
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:53,633
Start your timer.

570
00:32:54,036 --> 00:32:55,484
Five-minute grace,

571
00:32:55,745 --> 00:32:57,466
then the system resets.

572
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,807
All the evidence is bar-coded.

573
00:33:00,957 --> 00:33:02,896
You'll find your stuff
in here someplace...

574
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,921
All your guns, all your drugs.

575
00:33:07,864 --> 00:33:08,986
Okay, it's good.

576
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,740
Look at that! That's him!
He's the one!

577
00:33:18,865 --> 00:33:22,050
My name is I'm Jimmy Popodokolos,
and I represent miss Dagostino here.

578
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,919
We're a little busy. Every cop
is hitting the streets right now.

579
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,963
I am gonna Sue you...

580
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:30,239
- And I am gonna sue the city.
- Here's the thing,

581
00:33:30,364 --> 00:33:33,059
We need to do is I want to see
the department's legal counsel now.

582
00:33:33,331 --> 00:33:36,064
Fine. Just wait over there.
I'll have somebody escort you.

583
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:38,619
You better listen to him, wise guy.

584
00:34:41,826 --> 00:34:43,492
Artie Van's Ledger.

585
00:34:54,922 --> 00:34:56,427
It's gonna end right here, dad.

586
00:35:01,468 --> 00:35:02,391
You ready?

587
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:11,923
How'd you know?

588
00:35:12,048 --> 00:35:13,829
You'd never take the money and run.

589
00:35:14,177 --> 00:35:16,671
$5 million's a lot of money, Nathan.

590
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,116
For you, it's never about the money.

591
00:35:19,795 --> 00:35:21,994
I knew that growing up,
watching you.

592
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,704
It was about respect for you.

593
00:35:24,597 --> 00:35:27,319
- Artie van's ledger.
- Yeah, they made copies.

594
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:29,541
You know that won't hold up.

595
00:35:30,314 --> 00:35:31,712
The original disappears,

596
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:34,465
the case against
the big families goes away,

597
00:35:34,726 --> 00:35:36,588
and who do they owe?

598
00:35:37,405 --> 00:35:40,220
Jimmy Ford,
the biggest fixer in town.

599
00:35:42,327 --> 00:35:45,343
Let's join up.
Together, we can run this town.

600
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:52,801
It's too late.

601
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,569
- What do you mean?
- My people are gonna take down

602
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:58,238
the Russians, and any minute now,
the cops are gonna come.

603
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,034
I'm not going back to prison.

604
00:36:03,196 --> 00:36:04,196
All right.

605
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:06,910
Right here.

606
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,671
You can't do this.

607
00:36:14,793 --> 00:36:16,012
I could, but...

608
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:18,550
You're your mother's son.

609
00:36:26,215 --> 00:36:27,059
Go.

610
00:36:30,806 --> 00:36:31,808
Get out.

611
00:36:59,996 --> 00:37:01,020
Open up!

612
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,285
Move, move!

613
00:37:19,596 --> 00:37:20,695
Napkins?

614
00:37:25,135 --> 00:37:26,899
This cannot be right! Time!

615
00:37:28,337 --> 00:37:31,540
Is this the right time? I keep scanning.
More boxes! More boxes!

616
00:37:48,341 --> 00:37:49,516
You let him go.

617
00:37:53,056 --> 00:37:53,979
I had to.

618
00:37:54,918 --> 00:37:55,918
I know.

619
00:38:10,237 --> 00:38:11,237
It's not time!

620
00:38:17,393 --> 00:38:18,503
Stupid thing!

621
00:38:18,798 --> 00:38:20,878
Age of the gig, baby.
Stay strong.

622
00:38:25,461 --> 00:38:27,116
- Don't move!
- Hands in the air!

623
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,176
Look at this.

624
00:38:30,535 --> 00:38:33,029
You guys did everything
but cuff yourselves.

625
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,011
Help 'em out, boys.

626
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,776
Aidan McTeague.

627
00:38:43,102 --> 00:38:44,833
Yeah, this is Jimmy Ford.

628
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,597
Damn straight.

629
00:38:47,817 --> 00:38:49,853
Say, I got some good news for you.

630
00:38:51,421 --> 00:38:53,534
Yeah, I got the ledger right here.

631
00:38:55,532 --> 00:38:58,625
What's that?
What would you want to do that for?

632
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:03,548
Jimmy Ford for Bridgette O'Hare.

633
00:39:04,408 --> 00:39:05,650
It's a gift.

634
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:11,515
Ronin Donnelly, I worked for your father
for 30 years. I wouldn't...

635
00:39:15,209 --> 00:39:16,853
Mr. Donnelly, it's not true.

636
00:39:34,851 --> 00:39:35,851
Geez.

637
00:39:36,923 --> 00:39:38,937
Nathan, what the hell have you done?

638
00:39:44,747 --> 00:39:46,653
Yeah, I called each of the families.

639
00:39:46,881 --> 00:39:49,928
I told them that you were the one
who stole the evidence against them.

640
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:52,764
They were grateful.

641
00:39:55,304 --> 00:39:56,560
Until I laid out the deal.

642
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,230
He wants $500,000 to destroy it.
Otherwise,

643
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:04,359
it goes right back to the evidence room.
Not a Penny less, Mr. Mcteague.

644
00:40:05,992 --> 00:40:07,506
You blackmailed them?

645
00:40:08,845 --> 00:40:10,323
You blackmailed them.

646
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,035
- They almost killed me.
- Of course they did.

647
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:16,522
You've got a price on your head
bigger than most of my team's scores.

648
00:40:17,045 --> 00:40:20,459
- Who wouldn't want that kind of scratch?
- You want me killed, then?

649
00:40:22,697 --> 00:40:24,254
See that boat behind you?

650
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:32,137
You're running me out of town?
My own son?

651
00:40:32,686 --> 00:40:34,722
Cheap passage booked
under "Jimmy Logue".

652
00:40:34,847 --> 00:40:36,433
You'll be in Galway in two weeks.

653
00:40:36,955 --> 00:40:37,955
Logue.

654
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,138
Your mother's maiden name.
How sweet of you.

655
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:42,752
You better hurry up.

656
00:40:42,877 --> 00:40:45,609
A man with no suitcase
is likely to look suspicious,

657
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,238
so try to act natural.

658
00:40:47,456 --> 00:40:49,340
You betrayed your own father.

659
00:40:51,327 --> 00:40:53,211
You're more ruthless than me.

660
00:40:54,191 --> 00:40:55,726
Crueler than me.

661
00:41:00,256 --> 00:41:02,129
Maybe you are better than me.

662
00:41:06,861 --> 00:41:08,603
I'm proud of you, son.

663
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:18,975
Enjoy your retirement.

664
00:41:46,512 --> 00:41:47,601
That was...

665
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:51,031
Kind, what you did.

666
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:55,016
So, is Nate gonna be nice now?

667
00:41:55,836 --> 00:41:57,219
Don't count on it.
