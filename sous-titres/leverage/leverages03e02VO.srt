1
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,407
- Down!
- Not my work!

2
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:38,162
No! My work!

3
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:41,008
Not my work!

4
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:50,620
The rich and powerful take
what they want.

5
00:00:50,745 --> 00:00:52,093
We steal it back for you.

6
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:03,437
Sometimes, bad guys
make the best good guys.

7
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,239
We provide leverage!

8
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,528
Season 3 Episode 2
<i>The Reunion Job</i>

9
00:01:14,192 --> 00:01:17,031
All my work, erased, and I was only
days away from cracking Manticore.

10
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,558
What's Manticore?

11
00:01:19,035 --> 00:01:20,871
It's an electronic
surveillance system.

12
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,207
The Iranian government uses it
to track protesters

13
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:25,876
over cellphones, social networks,
even e-mail.

14
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:28,157
Hacker underground's flipping out
about it.

15
00:01:28,282 --> 00:01:31,799
They use GPS to pinpoint a dissident,
then they swoop in and make the arrest.

16
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,309
The Internet made this protest possible,
but now it's just a...

17
00:01:34,434 --> 00:01:35,440
a liability?

18
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,523
The government uses
the people's weapon.

19
00:01:37,648 --> 00:01:38,472
Precisely.

20
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:41,479
I cannot even communicate
with my family in Iran.

21
00:01:42,127 --> 00:01:43,727
Manticore would find them.

22
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,605
I have no idea if they are safe.

23
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:47,640
And the secret police
are everywhere.

24
00:01:47,963 --> 00:01:50,776
Next week, our people are planning
a protest to coincide with the election.

25
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,512
If I can't shut down Manticore,

26
00:01:52,637 --> 00:01:54,921
The government will find
and arrest every organizer

27
00:01:55,046 --> 00:01:56,695
and break
the backbone of the movement.

28
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,243
We're not spy hunters, Mr. Madavhi.

29
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,954
I cannot go to the FBI. My activities
would violate my student visa.

30
00:02:02,407 --> 00:02:04,164
So you want your data back.

31
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:06,190
I want Manticore destroyed.

32
00:02:06,713 --> 00:02:08,281
I want my people to be free.

33
00:02:09,352 --> 00:02:11,774
All right, we'll discuss it.

34
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:20,243
Discuss it?

35
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:22,266
This is so not our game, Hardison.

36
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:25,978
Not our g... this isn't just some hacker
okay? Cyrus...

37
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,811
Cyrus? It's Mr. Madavhi.
You can't get that attached.

38
00:02:29,245 --> 00:02:30,530
Fine. Mr. Madavhi.

39
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:33,000
He could go make a fortune
working for Google or Microsoft.

40
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:36,114
No, instead he risks his life
fighting the bad guys.

41
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,411
This is so our game.

42
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:38,866
He wasn't hit by the Vezarat.

43
00:02:51,513 --> 00:02:52,727
What, are you lurking?

44
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:56,509
I'm a lurker. That's my thing.

45
00:02:57,117 --> 00:02:58,330
What's the Vezarat?

46
00:02:58,455 --> 00:03:00,185
That's the Iranian secret police.

47
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:03,808
And trust me, if they wanted Cyrus,
he wouldn't be sitting, talking to us.

48
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,954
But the Vezarat is still
our logical target.

49
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:08,942
So we should check our sources,
see if there's a safe house in the area.

50
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,689
So we're on this?

51
00:03:11,183 --> 00:03:14,376
Yeah, we were always on this.
I just wanted you to explain to me why.

52
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:24,703
You know how I feel about mind games.
Negatively.

53
00:03:32,216 --> 00:03:33,754
What are you looking at, lurker?

54
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:42,179
My sources say this cafe is
the local Vezarat safe house.

55
00:03:43,252 --> 00:03:45,501
They're gonna win every year,
they win every year.

56
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,755
Every single year in Dallas,
they're gonna win.

57
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,880
How you doing?

58
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:51,689
Lloyd Hickey, Boston health department.
Spot inspection.

59
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,071
We were just inspected.
Everything is in order here.

60
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:04,608
There's a roach in my shish leek!

61
00:04:06,991 --> 00:04:08,830
Roach infestation in the shish leek.

62
00:04:08,955 --> 00:04:11,069
- That's gonna cost you.
- That's gonna cost you.

63
00:04:11,597 --> 00:04:13,572
Let's have a look at that kitchen,
shall we?

64
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,348
Back room, east corner.

65
00:04:19,473 --> 00:04:20,237
<i>Got it.</i>

66
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,609
Eliot, get rid of it.

67
00:04:24,132 --> 00:04:25,347
I think he likes you.

68
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:29,601
You're gonna pay for this.

69
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,525
We are gonna actually need to talk
to all of your employees.

70
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:39,236
- This young fellow, you, sir, you.
- All the employees.

71
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:41,138
The young bucktooth chap
in the back.

72
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:42,666
At the east corner.

73
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:57,543
For a den of evil spies,
this place smells delicious.

74
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,965
Hardison, confiscate some pastries.

75
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,329
<i>No sign of Cyrus' hardware.</i>

76
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:07,473
They could have cloned his data.
Check the computer.

77
00:05:20,268 --> 00:05:21,654
This schwarma is lukewarm!

78
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:23,712
That's gonna cost you 5 points.

79
00:05:23,837 --> 00:05:26,378
- That's gonna cost you.
- No, it's horrible. What, are you...

80
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,997
There's nothing on Manticore.

81
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,322
I'm starting a syntax search.

82
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,177
Wait. Hold on.

83
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:38,544
That image on the bottom left,
there,

84
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,043
Manticore.

85
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:44,593
It's a mythological creature.
It's persian for "Man-Eater."

86
00:05:46,365 --> 00:05:48,514
I was just about to click on that.
What are you...

87
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:51,433
<i>Right. Sure.</i>

88
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,795
Let's copy Cyrus' program.

89
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,400
I'd love to, but it's not here.

90
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:58,992
It doesn't even look like
they even heard of Cyrus.

91
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:10,890
I've got payment records here.
Last one dated three weeks ago.

92
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,981
Those look like clean hands to you?

93
00:06:17,787 --> 00:06:18,794
Smell'em.

94
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:20,772
I got to dock ya!

95
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:28,887
The latest Manticore update
was also three weeks ago.

96
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,681
And who was that payment to?

97
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:41,297
Larry Duberman,
founder and CEO of Dubertech.

98
00:06:41,422 --> 00:06:44,611
Back in the '90s, he wrote the book
on digital database security.

99
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,595
Literally wrote the book.

100
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:50,626
Now, he made a couple hundred million
during the digital revolution.

101
00:06:51,602 --> 00:06:54,913
Why would Larry Duberman
be selling software to Iran?

102
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,425
He doesn't need the money.

103
00:06:56,755 --> 00:06:58,292
- Thanks, sugar.
- But he does.

104
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,686
Cloud storage,
distributed processing,

105
00:07:00,811 --> 00:07:03,167
all these sexy
new little technologies

106
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:04,930
are passing up Duberman's company.

107
00:07:05,055 --> 00:07:07,573
They're leaving him in the dust.
He's got to expand his market share.

108
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,721
He sells the technology
to embargoed countries,

109
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,180
and the income is tax-free?

110
00:07:12,305 --> 00:07:14,349
Nice way to keep the bottom line
from being squeezed.

111
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:17,936
Now, Duberman has a long-term contract
to run Manticore for Iran.

112
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:21,648
This man has become the IT department
for the axis of evil.

113
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,323
All right, so Eliot was right.

114
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,070
The Vezarat didn't go after Cyrus,
Duberman did.

115
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:29,326
It's not about politics, man.
Cyrus is bad business for him.

116
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,676
Duberman's our target.

117
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:34,809
What are we up against?

118
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:38,719
The master control server's
in Duberman's private office.

119
00:07:38,844 --> 00:07:40,487
We shut down the server over here,

120
00:07:40,612 --> 00:07:42,336
we shut down Manticore over there.

121
00:07:43,086 --> 00:07:45,047
- So, get to hacking, man.
- Dude,

122
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:48,307
what is it about
"wrote the book on database security"

123
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:51,845
that you don't comprehend?
I can't just access Manticore remotely,

124
00:07:52,485 --> 00:07:54,576
we've got to get to that server
in person.

125
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,709
Any of you ever trimmed a bonsai?

126
00:08:00,415 --> 00:08:02,026
You know, I did.

127
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:06,919
I was in Osaka, and I met this Japanese
policewoman at a geisha bar.

128
00:08:07,676 --> 00:08:08,680
An other time.

129
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:15,711
Why is Eliot pouring your tea?

130
00:08:16,418 --> 00:08:17,833
Did you brainwash him again?

131
00:08:19,164 --> 00:08:20,804
Neuro-linguistic programming.

132
00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:23,128
It's amazing what you can do
with the power of suggestion.

133
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,008
"Sugar." "Squeezed."

134
00:08:25,869 --> 00:08:28,271
A few strategic pats on the arm.

135
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:30,801
Damn it!

136
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,512
You owe me for that roach business!

137
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:35,180
Sophie, not again.

138
00:08:41,906 --> 00:08:44,213
These quarterly results aren't exactly
what we'd hoped.

139
00:08:44,338 --> 00:08:45,159
Fine.

140
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:48,106
We'll just raise the price
for our persian friends.

141
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,726
Sir, are you sure that's wise?
They're might not be...

142
00:08:50,851 --> 00:08:53,942
Where else are they gonna go?
McAfee? Oracle?

143
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,588
No, they're too soft
to get into the suppression business.

144
00:08:56,713 --> 00:09:00,132
No, if the Iranians want to hold on
to power, they have to pay me.

145
00:09:00,535 --> 00:09:02,718
That's what I call
a good business model.

146
00:09:04,717 --> 00:09:05,725
Watch it!

147
00:09:07,151 --> 00:09:09,016
- I'm sorry.
- Sloane, fire this idiot!

148
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:11,143
- I'm sorry.
- Actually, wait.

149
00:09:13,878 --> 00:09:14,995
You are fired!

150
00:09:16,731 --> 00:09:18,307
Easy, Mr. Hands.

151
00:09:20,964 --> 00:09:23,182
All right. We've got this,
Mr. Duberman.

152
00:09:23,307 --> 00:09:24,748
You do now.

153
00:09:24,873 --> 00:09:27,633
I want this pristine
when I get back from lunch!

154
00:10:20,544 --> 00:10:23,350
Seems we stepped out of Japan
and straight into high school.

155
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:24,978
In 1985.

156
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,052
You find the server
running Manticore?

157
00:10:37,532 --> 00:10:40,055
I found it. A small problem.

158
00:10:44,735 --> 00:10:47,521
He's running Manticore
from his high-school computer.

159
00:11:15,877 --> 00:11:18,677
Vintage 1980s technology, man.

160
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,637
I couldn't hack in from the outside.

161
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:22,597
<i>It's speaking a dead language.</i>

162
00:11:25,082 --> 00:11:26,801
Mr. Duberman left for lunch.

163
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,812
Possible breach! Repeat,

164
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:29,997
<i>possible breach.</i>

165
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:31,871
They're onto us. What's the deal?

166
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,336
He's got
a multi-tier password system.

167
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:36,111
My war-dialer broke into
the first few.

168
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:39,874
"Zavransky," "Mandydd,"
a bunch of other random ones.

169
00:11:43,413 --> 00:11:46,778
- Was that a good beep or a bad beep?
- That's a bad beep. We just hit a wall.

170
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:49,605
- You didn't get the password?
- <i>Not the master one.</i>

171
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,084
<i>The last one I got is...</i>

172
00:11:51,254 --> 00:11:52,752
<i>L33r15</i>

173
00:11:52,877 --> 00:11:54,148
<i>L06.</i>

174
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,644
High school.

175
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:04,222
Let's go!

176
00:12:04,606 --> 00:12:06,645
Hold on,
let me just finish copying this disk.

177
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:09,364
How did people get anything done
in the '80s?

178
00:12:24,186 --> 00:12:27,514
Nobody else thinks it's weird that you
can just buy anybody's yearbook online?

179
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:30,165
It's real cute, man,
how you still believe in privacy.

180
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,822
Here we go. Mrs. Zavransky,
math teacher.

181
00:12:32,947 --> 00:12:35,467
Now, I bet if we turn
to the cheerleaders...

182
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:38,350
Mandy.

183
00:12:39,651 --> 00:12:40,594
Mandy Babson.

184
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,850
What does the "DD" mean?

185
00:12:42,975 --> 00:12:44,346
- Seriously?
- Yes, right.

186
00:12:46,471 --> 00:12:48,809
Two scoops of ice cream...
just perfect.

187
00:12:48,978 --> 00:12:51,665
It was the last password
that tipped us off...

188
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,716
L33r1

189
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:55,611
5L06.

190
00:12:55,736 --> 00:12:58,151
Now, that has to be
a locker combination, right?

191
00:12:58,321 --> 00:13:00,685
He's clearly...
he's obsessed with high school...

192
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,018
Memorabilia,
his high-school computer.

193
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:05,303
Yeah, he's a classic computer nerd.

194
00:13:05,877 --> 00:13:06,877
Sorry.

195
00:13:07,483 --> 00:13:10,080
The girls totally ignored him.
The guys picked on him.

196
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,072
Now that he's a success,
he can't leave the past behind him

197
00:13:13,197 --> 00:13:15,922
Yeah, he has to remember who he was
'cause it made him who he is.

198
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:17,914
I feel bad for the nerd.

199
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,457
Don't feel bad for this guy.

200
00:13:19,582 --> 00:13:22,621
Getting bullied in high school is still
no excuse for propping up dictators.

201
00:13:22,746 --> 00:13:26,488
Take Hardisson, He got bulled his whole
high- school career. He's not criminal.

202
00:13:27,712 --> 00:13:29,849
- Don't think about that.
- Not a bad criminal.

203
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:31,935
What makes you think
I got bullied in high school?

204
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,397
Well, "A,"
you got a green hornet doll.

205
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:37,015
First of all,
it's a limited-edition action figure.

206
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,818
Second, it is green lantern.
Educate yourself.

207
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:41,972
- Now pay attention.
- Guys, wait. Listen.

208
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:44,239
We got a locker combination,

209
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:46,408
we have a teacher's name,
and we have a crush.

210
00:13:46,578 --> 00:13:50,162
So, Duberman, he has made
his old high school his roman room.

211
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:51,788
Of course.

212
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,039
"Of course"?

213
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:54,416
What's a roman room?

214
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,795
You have no idea, right?
You know...

215
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,436
You don't have any idea?

216
00:14:00,092 --> 00:14:02,635
It's a memory technique.
Each of his passwords

217
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,420
corresponds to an object in a space
that he's intimately familiar with...

218
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,822
In his case, the hallway of his old
high school where he kept his locker.

219
00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:12,891
Now, if I were to make this bar

220
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:14,200
my roman room,

221
00:14:14,325 --> 00:14:17,398
everything I need to remember
is right here. For instance,

222
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:19,578
this...

223
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,402
My bank password

224
00:14:22,572 --> 00:14:24,079
would be "Balmoor."

225
00:14:24,741 --> 00:14:27,466
And my e-mail password
would be fitzy, here.

226
00:14:29,962 --> 00:14:32,938
- Nate just gave us his passwords.
- No, but I got all his passwords.

227
00:14:33,063 --> 00:14:36,056
You want to see his netflix queue?
He has every season of "Rockford files".

228
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:38,335
Every season of "Sex and the city",
that show "Psych".

229
00:14:39,204 --> 00:14:41,701
Listen, if we can't get into
the main server

230
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:44,118
without Duberman's
master password...

231
00:14:44,243 --> 00:14:45,966
You can't hack into that, right?

232
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:48,678
No, password's up in the guy's head.
I can't hack a guy's head.

233
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:51,947
So the only option would be
to break inside

234
00:14:52,072 --> 00:14:54,643
- his Roman room.
- You want break into the high school?

235
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,897
I could do that blindfolded.

236
00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:01,691
- Let's do it blindfolded.
- What we're gonna do is we're gonna

237
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:03,712
break into that high school...

238
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:06,495
25 years ago.

239
00:15:08,112 --> 00:15:11,702
What do you know?
Class of '85 has a reunion coming up...

240
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:13,665
In 8 months.

241
00:15:21,457 --> 00:15:23,227
Hi. Edna Kasendorf?

242
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:25,735
With the class
of '85 alumni committee?

243
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:28,231
Boy, am I glad I reached you.

244
00:15:28,454 --> 00:15:30,303
It's Sharon Wing from Radford High.

245
00:15:30,473 --> 00:15:32,192
Sharon, how are you?

246
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:33,868
It's Edna Kasendorf.

247
00:15:33,993 --> 00:15:35,600
From the alumni committee.

248
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,700
Do I have some bad news.

249
00:15:37,825 --> 00:15:39,997
The gym's being renovated
in the fall,

250
00:15:40,122 --> 00:15:43,275
and it's gonna be a total shambles
when it's time for the reunion.

251
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:45,357
The gym available on the 28th?

252
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:50,314
Our most prominent alum,
Larry Duberman...

253
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:51,450
Yes...

254
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:55,453
That Larry Duberman insists
the reunion happens this month.

255
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,018
And if I said you...

256
00:15:58,662 --> 00:15:59,881
Don't hate me...

257
00:16:00,174 --> 00:16:01,193
This month?

258
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:02,877
Say, the 28th?

259
00:16:04,815 --> 00:16:05,975
Thank you!

260
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,721
You're a doll.

261
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,213
I'm gonna send you
a boxload of crullahs.

262
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,441
<i>Impossible!</i>

263
00:16:15,863 --> 00:16:17,142
<i>That is more than double</i>

264
00:16:17,312 --> 00:16:20,687
- <i>what we agreed to pay for the upgrade.</i>
- If you'd rather have your homegrown

265
00:16:20,857 --> 00:16:23,365
dweeb squad administer Manticore,
be my guest.

266
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,609
Though we both know
they can barely send an e-vite.

267
00:16:32,736 --> 00:16:33,736
Yes?

268
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:37,646
Your high-school alumni committee?

269
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:41,291
I'll let you gentlemen discuss this.

270
00:16:41,654 --> 00:16:43,598
But know that, when we meet,

271
00:16:44,232 --> 00:16:46,529
ou can either deliver the money,
or I can

272
00:16:46,654 --> 00:16:49,693
turn over certain sensitive information
to the FBI.

273
00:16:50,158 --> 00:16:51,693
They're clients, too.

274
00:17:00,672 --> 00:17:01,926
Larry Duberman.

275
00:17:03,472 --> 00:17:04,574
A reunion?

276
00:17:07,812 --> 00:17:08,860
The 28th?

277
00:17:10,707 --> 00:17:12,364
Well, I certainly appreciate

278
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:14,961
the personal invitation,
but I don't know that I...

279
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,911
Who else is coming?

280
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,624
Mandy Babson, of course.
You remember her?

281
00:17:23,164 --> 00:17:25,126
<i>And, </i>Danny Stoltz.

282
00:17:25,297 --> 00:17:27,101
Jennifer <i>Jakubowski.</i>

283
00:17:28,168 --> 00:17:29,422
<i>Emily Weston...</i>

284
00:17:30,336 --> 00:17:32,092
Drake McIntyre.

285
00:17:32,262 --> 00:17:33,262
Really?

286
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:35,242
They'll all be there?

287
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,682
Well, then,
I wouldn't miss it for the world!

288
00:17:39,097 --> 00:17:40,450
<i>Okay. Bye-bye.</i>

289
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,361
Sir, your meeting
with the Iranians is the 28th.

290
00:17:45,486 --> 00:17:46,486
Sloane...

291
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:48,783
I've spoken at Davos,

292
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,099
I've met Presidents
and Prime Ministers.

293
00:17:52,356 --> 00:17:54,735
I've got a yacht
with a squash court.

294
00:17:56,026 --> 00:17:59,647
But what's the meaning of any of that
if I can't rub it in their faces?

295
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:23,294
So many awkward people
in so many ugly outfits.

296
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,603
<i>You're lucky you never went
to high school.</i>

297
00:18:25,774 --> 00:18:27,872
Nothing but heartbreak and homework.

298
00:18:27,997 --> 00:18:29,691
<i>Didn't you</i> go to your prom?

299
00:18:30,028 --> 00:18:31,568
I was kind of busy.

300
00:18:33,615 --> 00:18:36,531
Looks like the Bank of Iceland's paying
off Nana's medical bills.

301
00:18:40,424 --> 00:18:41,595
That's dope!

302
00:18:42,674 --> 00:18:43,674
Good times.

303
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,959
You guys all get to go to the reunion,
and I'm stuck on goon patrol?

304
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:50,056
Eliot, listen.
Once we get the password,

305
00:18:50,423 --> 00:18:53,103
you got to enter it on Duberman's
computer and destroy Manticore.

306
00:18:53,228 --> 00:18:54,710
Hardison's a little occupied.

307
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:57,604
Besides, I'm sure you already had
your high-school fun.

308
00:18:57,729 --> 00:18:59,304
Big man on campus.

309
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:00,680
What, quarterback?

310
00:19:02,602 --> 00:19:05,698
Come on, Eliot. This is so lame.
Quarterbacks do not take home nec.

311
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:07,196
I got my reasons.

312
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,106
Let's get out of here.

313
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:14,033
Like this.

314
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:16,646
Knives are like people.

315
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:19,506
It's all about the context.

316
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:22,952
I had many interests.

317
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:55,963
You own this place.

318
00:20:09,102 --> 00:20:11,715
- Great to see you.
- Great to see you, too!

319
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:13,836
Lookin' good, Larry!

320
00:20:16,356 --> 00:20:18,863
Yes, it's me, in the flesh.

321
00:20:18,988 --> 00:20:20,930
Hi, Larry. Great to see you again.

322
00:20:23,258 --> 00:20:26,465
- I saw you on tv last night.
- You saw me on "Larry King"!

323
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:29,465
- Which time?
- I guess the most current one.

324
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,906
You look great.

325
00:20:31,973 --> 00:20:34,375
Really?
Mr. Voetberg's history class?

326
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,653
Yes, we did that paper together
on the civil war.

327
00:20:38,055 --> 00:20:41,784
B-plus, I believe, because someone
didn't do his share of the research.

328
00:20:41,952 --> 00:20:43,305
Right, right. Yeah.

329
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:46,235
- Sorry about that.
- Excuse me just a minute.

330
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,235
Well, if it isn't the president
of the computer club, himself...

331
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,055
Larry Duberman.

332
00:20:52,379 --> 00:20:54,048
It's great to see you...

333
00:20:54,598 --> 00:20:55,598
Grace.

334
00:20:55,735 --> 00:20:57,673
Pizza-face Grace?
Grace Peltz?

335
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:00,024
- It's right here on my badge.
- Yeah.

336
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:03,317
- Are you sure you don't remember me?
- Of course I remember you.

337
00:21:03,442 --> 00:21:06,444
Well, it's okay.
I hardly remember myself.

338
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:07,683
There I am.

339
00:21:08,154 --> 00:21:09,154
Right.

340
00:21:09,753 --> 00:21:11,054
"Grace Peltz"!

341
00:21:21,492 --> 00:21:23,545
I wore glasses since I was 8.

342
00:21:23,952 --> 00:21:26,872
Five years ago,
I finally got contacts.

343
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:31,928
- You've certainly blossomed.
- So have you, Mr. Mogul.

344
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,715
Is it true that you have
a squash court on your yacht?

345
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,677
Yes. Yes, I do.

346
00:21:38,412 --> 00:21:39,994
And a bowling alley.

347
00:21:40,573 --> 00:21:43,072
My two favorite sports.

348
00:21:43,753 --> 00:21:45,122
Oh, my. Is that...

349
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,173
Oh, my gosh, it is.

350
00:21:48,717 --> 00:21:50,350
It's Drake McIntyre.

351
00:21:57,603 --> 00:21:59,610
- Drake the snake.
- Hey, Drake!

352
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,378
Drake McIntyre.

353
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:04,944
X, y, z, bro.

354
00:22:11,316 --> 00:22:12,766
I don't believe it.

355
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,087
Drake? Is that you?

356
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:18,374
If I wasn't on my second husband...

357
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:20,995
Mandy, you still got it.
You still got it, honey.

358
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:23,864
Hey! What's up?
Hey! All right!

359
00:22:24,174 --> 00:22:25,529
Drake McIntyre.

360
00:22:27,098 --> 00:22:28,320
Looks different.

361
00:22:28,998 --> 00:22:30,057
25 years.

362
00:22:31,155 --> 00:22:32,392
People change.

363
00:22:33,623 --> 00:22:36,339
Every narrative has a Nemesis.

364
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:38,442
Who's Duberman's?

365
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:40,650
This one. Drake McIntyre.

366
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,026
I think I could pass.

367
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,024
Lucky dude will be winning two tickets to
see the Pats play in Miami that weekend.

368
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:52,251
Yo, Doucherman!

369
00:22:54,245 --> 00:22:55,948
That's Drake, all right.

370
00:22:56,225 --> 00:22:59,072
You don't have to take that from him
anymore. You should say something.

371
00:22:59,763 --> 00:23:01,217
In due time. First,

372
00:23:01,722 --> 00:23:04,386
can I get you
some mystery meat at the buffet?

373
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:06,061
I already ate.

374
00:23:06,186 --> 00:23:08,701
Five months of dieting
to fit into this dress.

375
00:23:09,217 --> 00:23:10,722
But I'll go with you.

376
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:12,658
Thanks.

377
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,605
<i>How'd you know
that was his nickname?</i>

378
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,815
With a name like Duberman,
not exactly rocket science.

379
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,980
Hey! What's up?
Hardison, they're swarming me.

380
00:23:20,105 --> 00:23:22,273
Give me something,
or they're gonna blow my cover.

381
00:23:23,117 --> 00:23:24,567
Got you. I got you.

382
00:23:26,242 --> 00:23:29,407
Ally Kassakian...
She was the head of the drama club.

383
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:31,701
Mark Pereira...

384
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:36,042
He just divorced
his high-school sweetheart, Nancy.

385
00:23:36,501 --> 00:23:38,492
Ally, you're looking hot.
Still acting?

386
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,346
I'll bet you're terrific.
Hey, Mark, listen, man.

387
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:43,928
Hey, Drake.
Hey, how you doing?

388
00:23:44,053 --> 00:23:46,341
I heard about Nancy.
I just want to say, it sucks, dude.

389
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:49,771
I can't believe Jaclyn Thomas
had the nerve to show up

390
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:51,430
after what she did to Katherine.

391
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,569
Guys, forget about the gossip.
Stick with the con.

392
00:23:56,047 --> 00:23:59,320
You know, I'm trying, man. It's just,
I feel like I know these people now.

393
00:24:00,387 --> 00:24:02,212
Kills me to see a nice girl
like Cindy Taylor

394
00:24:02,337 --> 00:24:04,196
settle for a guy
like Aaron Ferguson.

395
00:24:04,321 --> 00:24:06,389
Yeah, all right, listen,
I'm gonna lean on Duberman.

396
00:24:06,514 --> 00:24:08,584
Get him to the Roman room.
I'm going right now.

397
00:24:08,912 --> 00:24:11,080
I can't believe it! Drake Mac!

398
00:24:12,762 --> 00:24:14,918
Hey, Schmitty!
Hey, how you doing, pal?

399
00:24:15,043 --> 00:24:17,138
"How you doing, pal?
"That's all you got for me?

400
00:24:17,263 --> 00:24:19,165
I'm on it, I'm on it.

401
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:21,959
- "Schmitty."
- <i>You don't remember? Come on?</i>

402
00:24:23,191 --> 00:24:25,296
There's no "Schmitty" here.
Parker?

403
00:24:25,706 --> 00:24:27,643
- Sorry.
- Watch it, girly.

404
00:24:28,774 --> 00:24:30,296
Come on, you don't remember?

405
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:34,667
Ferguson's party.
We took the 30-pack...

406
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:37,337
Drake wrote: "I'll always remember
those nights gettin' wicked pissed

407
00:24:37,462 --> 00:24:40,728
"and puking off the Medford bridge.
Schmitt-head and Mac attack forever"?

408
00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:42,068
Schmitt-head!

409
00:24:42,513 --> 00:24:44,603
Mac attack forever!

410
00:24:46,404 --> 00:24:48,504
Maybe it's a good thing
I missed high school.

411
00:24:50,852 --> 00:24:52,646
Can you give me
one of your crappiest beers

412
00:24:52,771 --> 00:24:54,826
- in one of your red plastic cups?
- Sure.

413
00:24:56,566 --> 00:24:59,524
- Good memories here?
- Good and bad.

414
00:24:59,987 --> 00:25:02,727
This hall is burned in my mind.

415
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:05,628
Say, wasn't
that Mrs. Zavransky's room?

416
00:25:06,035 --> 00:25:07,631
Had her for homeroom.

417
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,439
Pat Brander once gave me a wedgie
in front of the whole class.

418
00:25:10,564 --> 00:25:12,009
Pat Brander.

419
00:25:13,404 --> 00:25:14,679
Let's check out Brander.

420
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:19,725
Try "Brander303".
That's the room number.

421
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:24,564
It looks like it's unlocked.

422
00:25:27,521 --> 00:25:28,971
It's payroll files.

423
00:25:30,575 --> 00:25:32,164
Guys, patience.

424
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:36,197
If we get him riled up, push his buttons,
he'll lead us to the password we want.

425
00:25:41,853 --> 00:25:42,853
You know...

426
00:25:44,054 --> 00:25:48,058
Who brought the party out here?
Is that Doucherman?

427
00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:50,923
How's it hanging there, Doucherman?

428
00:25:51,246 --> 00:25:53,372
Drake! What a pleasure!

429
00:25:55,194 --> 00:25:58,213
And is that
Grace "Felt pants" Peltz...

430
00:25:58,636 --> 00:25:59,557
all grown up?

431
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:00,876
Hello, Drake.

432
00:26:01,883 --> 00:26:03,853
I assumed you'd be fat.

433
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:07,273
I know, right? You know?
Cleaning pools keeps me fit.

434
00:26:09,713 --> 00:26:11,736
Aren't you a little
out of this guy's league?

435
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:14,317
- Yes, he is!
- Quit it! Quit!

436
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,616
We're not 18 anymore!

437
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:19,702
- I'm just reliving the good old times.
- "Good times"?

438
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,272
You think they were
good times for me?

439
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,846
Like when you told Amy Tuttleton,

440
00:26:24,971 --> 00:26:27,960
the prettiest girl in school, that I had
both male and female genitalia?

441
00:26:29,983 --> 00:26:32,484
I forgot about that!
Yeah, that was classic.

442
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,634
"Tuttleton."

443
00:26:37,158 --> 00:26:38,802
You want me to try "Hermaphrodite"?

444
00:26:39,095 --> 00:26:40,909
But now things have changed.

445
00:26:41,205 --> 00:26:42,709
- You clean pools?
- I do.

446
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,060
I have eight of them.

447
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:46,280
I should give you one of my cards.

448
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:48,014
No, you don't get it, do you?

449
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,917
- I won.
- Come on, now.

450
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:52,953
You're not still steamed about stuff
that happened 25 years ago?

451
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,296
Come on. It's...

452
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,602
Listen, you know, it wasn't all bad.

453
00:26:56,727 --> 00:26:58,738
Did your brain only
remember the painful bits?

454
00:26:58,863 --> 00:27:00,402
Just the important stuff.

455
00:27:00,527 --> 00:27:02,370
Like what happened in the library.

456
00:27:03,142 --> 00:27:05,365
- Yeah. Go on.
- No, you remember.

457
00:27:05,768 --> 00:27:07,431
- I was sitting there.
- Well...

458
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:14,131
What do we have here?

459
00:27:14,865 --> 00:27:16,418
Larry Duberman.

460
00:27:17,028 --> 00:27:20,506
Everyone's buzzing about you,
Mr. Big man on campus.

461
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:22,598
Who? Doucherman?

462
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:24,877
Come on, you know,
he's got lady parts.

463
00:27:25,002 --> 00:27:27,103
You know, you should
be talking to me.

464
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,692
Drake McIntyre.

465
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,872
Well, some people do
get finer with age.

466
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:35,959
Well, right back at you...
"Nikki."

467
00:27:36,754 --> 00:27:38,990
Got to be kidding me.
Guys, look.

468
00:27:39,182 --> 00:27:42,201
Guys, there's like six Nicoles,
three Veronicas and a Dominique.

469
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,786
This may take a while.

470
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:48,728
Don't tell me you don't remember me
without my cheerleading uniform on?

471
00:27:49,215 --> 00:27:51,636
- He's also seen me with it off.
- Classy.

472
00:27:53,503 --> 00:27:55,537
Nikki, you.

473
00:27:55,662 --> 00:27:57,756
Say, why don't you go
get us some drinks?

474
00:27:58,664 --> 00:28:01,041
And then we'll reminisce later.
It'll be okay.

475
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:03,887
I'm not letting you out of my sight!

476
00:28:04,189 --> 00:28:05,189
Come on!

477
00:28:14,247 --> 00:28:15,374
You know, Nikki...

478
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:19,922
The bar is down there.
Why don't we go...

479
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:22,118
Please.
You don't have to get me drunk.

480
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:35,825
I don't mean to be insulting
or anything, Nikki, but...

481
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:38,104
I'm not sure I have...

482
00:28:38,229 --> 00:28:40,244
I'm not sure I have feelings
for you anymore.

483
00:28:40,725 --> 00:28:42,672
I like you, maybe as friends.
We'll...

484
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,280
If that's the way it's gonna be.

485
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:48,991
Nikki!

486
00:28:56,016 --> 00:28:57,016
I'm sorry!

487
00:29:02,202 --> 00:29:03,358
Nikki, I'm sorry!

488
00:29:07,016 --> 00:29:08,644
Parker, it seems my...

489
00:29:09,402 --> 00:29:12,531
ex-flame has locked me in the...

490
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:14,528
I don't know...

491
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:17,260
Storage closet or something
in the East hallway, so...

492
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:20,049
You must have
really broken her heart.

493
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:22,000
High school is so dramatic!

494
00:29:26,615 --> 00:29:28,612
They give trophies for chess.

495
00:29:35,989 --> 00:29:37,317
It's the Vezarat.

496
00:29:38,023 --> 00:29:39,227
They're coming in!

497
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,742
Wait a minute.
What are the Iranians doing there?

498
00:29:50,477 --> 00:29:51,877
Thank you, Parker.

499
00:29:52,262 --> 00:29:54,389
No problem.
Guess what I heard.

500
00:29:54,514 --> 00:29:56,915
A bunch of ladies said Drake
McIntyre was the best they ever had.

501
00:29:57,423 --> 00:29:58,364
Really?

502
00:29:58,489 --> 00:30:01,830
Frank Dinunzio
stuffed you in locker 243.

503
00:30:03,657 --> 00:30:04,912
What happened to Drake?

504
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:07,962
I just wanted him out of the picture,
so I can have you all to myself.

505
00:30:08,918 --> 00:30:10,652
Your dress. I'm so sorry.

506
00:30:10,777 --> 00:30:12,654
No, it's fine.
It's fine! I've seen worse.

507
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:15,149
You better go wash that off,
'cause that could stain.

508
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:17,885
- No, really, it's...
- Grace... go ahead.

509
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:20,249
We have all evening to catch up.

510
00:30:24,634 --> 00:30:26,705
So, did you ever see
the girls' locker room?

511
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:30,540
That's where we used to shower
after cheerleading practice.

512
00:30:32,917 --> 00:30:34,367
What happened? He got away?

513
00:30:34,492 --> 00:30:37,074
She took him,
that bloody little slut!

514
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:38,542
All right, calm down, now.

515
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:40,765
No, just because I'm not
a cheerleader or something...

516
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,085
Let's forget about her.

517
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:44,554
Eliot has company, and we're
no closer to getting the password,

518
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:47,428
- So I think we need to escalate.
- Well, you think he's ready?

519
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,062
Guys?

520
00:30:49,187 --> 00:30:51,542
I've accounted for all
the Nikkis of the class of '85.

521
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:53,392
Your Nikki's not
even in the yearbook.

522
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,359
Okay, so she's a fraud like us?

523
00:30:55,484 --> 00:30:59,023
What is she, just some random
hussy who's out for his cash?

524
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:01,912
Not exactly.

525
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:06,375
She's a hired gun.

526
00:31:07,868 --> 00:31:08,968
An assassin?

527
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,872
Nikki is an assassin?

528
00:31:11,997 --> 00:31:15,581
Yeah, I guess we weren't the only ones
with the bright idea to pose as alumni.

529
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:18,295
This chick's connected to wetwork jobs
all up and down the East coast.

530
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,531
Russian mob, Italian mob,
there's a New Zealand mob?

531
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,256
- All right, this is our fault.
- I didn't do anything.

532
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:26,763
You know, we lured him
to an nonsecured environment.

533
00:31:26,888 --> 00:31:28,814
- We exposed him.
- And now we have to save him.

534
00:31:28,939 --> 00:31:32,119
We can't destroy Manticore with
him dead. So split up and find him.

535
00:31:32,677 --> 00:31:34,268
Eliot, what's happening on your end?

536
00:31:36,223 --> 00:31:37,895
"T" minus five seconds.

537
00:31:38,762 --> 00:31:40,288
This reunion sucks!

538
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,033
The Health Inspector?

539
00:31:52,716 --> 00:31:54,578
I'm gonna have to dock you again.

540
00:32:08,257 --> 00:32:10,386
Yeah, Duberman must have
pissed off the Iranians.

541
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:13,347
They hire an assassin to take him
out while they raid his office?

542
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,602
Eliot, you've got to keep 'em away
from that computer.

543
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:17,654
What do you think I'm doing?

544
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,415
Checkmate.

545
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,632
Or not.

546
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:38,246
What are you...

547
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,900
I'm not getting lucky, am I?

548
00:32:43,025 --> 00:32:45,160
Your luck has just
run out, Duberman.

549
00:32:45,285 --> 00:32:47,923
The Iranians don't care
for your negotiating style.

550
00:32:48,765 --> 00:32:51,017
Nikki... or whatever your name is...

551
00:32:51,142 --> 00:32:53,137
I can double what
they're paying you.

552
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:54,740
I'm sure you could.

553
00:32:54,912 --> 00:32:57,391
But that wouldn't look so
good for my reputation.

554
00:32:59,153 --> 00:33:00,242
Okay, wait!

555
00:33:01,986 --> 00:33:03,522
Let's figure out a price here.

556
00:33:07,239 --> 00:33:09,737
And by the way...
You're still a nerd.

557
00:33:12,231 --> 00:33:14,277
Grace!
Thank God!

558
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,166
I always hated cheerleaders.

559
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:35,387
It's mean girls like you that always
ruined high school for the rest of us!

560
00:33:35,943 --> 00:33:37,473
What the hell are you talking about?

561
00:33:50,255 --> 00:33:51,280
Damn it!

562
00:33:55,586 --> 00:33:56,738
Duberman!

563
00:33:59,165 --> 00:34:00,412
What are you doing?

564
00:34:01,617 --> 00:34:04,024
Hey, listen. No, wait.
You locked me in a closet,

565
00:34:04,149 --> 00:34:07,086
and you're trying to kill my friend here.
I'm starting not to like you.

566
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:10,130
They only paid me to deliver one body,
so get out of my way!

567
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,965
Just wait three seconds.

568
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,683
Now, why would I do that?

569
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:18,889
That's why.

570
00:34:20,647 --> 00:34:22,442
Catering... What a business.

571
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,234
Drake.

572
00:34:24,913 --> 00:34:26,897
I don't know why,
but you just saved me!

573
00:34:27,944 --> 00:34:29,897
You can call me "Doucherman"
all you like.

574
00:34:30,022 --> 00:34:31,670
Yeah, okay, all right.

575
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:36,164
Tell the truth, you weren't even
the cruelest to me in high school.

576
00:34:36,414 --> 00:34:38,200
You weren't as bad as Pat Brander.

577
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,514
No, and where's he tonight
to save your ass.

578
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,745
Right?
Right...

579
00:34:43,304 --> 00:34:44,331
Right.

580
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:45,499
Right

581
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,163
What are you doing?

582
00:34:50,553 --> 00:34:51,797
I just saved your life!

583
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:53,340
She.

584
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,967
- What?
- Pat Brander.

585
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,969
"Patricia."

586
00:34:58,862 --> 00:35:02,464
I've already been fooled once tonight.
It's not gonna happen again.

587
00:35:03,886 --> 00:35:04,980
Who are you?

588
00:35:09,912 --> 00:35:13,231
You not Drake McIntyre,
then who the hell are you?

589
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:16,488
Is anybody here who
they say they are?

590
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,743
Are you the real Grace Peltz?

591
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:23,062
There is no Grace Peltz.

592
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:25,748
She was a fiction invented
to flatter your ego.

593
00:35:28,196 --> 00:35:29,922
So you're with that assassin?

594
00:35:30,197 --> 00:35:33,088
- You're all trying to kill me?
- No, we're not trying to kill you,

595
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,219
just your business.

596
00:35:35,554 --> 00:35:39,548
Yes, on behalf of Cyrus Madavhi...
that kid you had beaten and robbed

597
00:35:40,175 --> 00:35:43,098
so that you could continue
to sell Manticore to Iran.

598
00:35:43,361 --> 00:35:45,465
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

599
00:35:45,972 --> 00:35:48,395
- I'm calling the police.
- Well, don't bother.

600
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:50,465
We already did,
and they should be on their way

601
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,611
just as soon as our man
inside your office

602
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:54,401
destroys Manticore
using your password.

603
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,921
You couldn't possibly...

604
00:35:57,046 --> 00:35:59,756
It was pretty easy to figure out
once we got inside this hallway.

605
00:35:59,881 --> 00:36:00,908
Zavransky...

606
00:36:01,816 --> 00:36:04,244
Mandy double-D,
your locker combination?

607
00:36:05,271 --> 00:36:06,429
Your're smart...

608
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:09,492
But you're not smart enough.

609
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,423
It's changed.

610
00:36:15,808 --> 00:36:18,884
All your work for nothing,
fake Drake.

611
00:36:19,338 --> 00:36:20,990
Yeah, it's done.

612
00:36:21,896 --> 00:36:23,259
Good to know.

613
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:32,687
Shut up.

614
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:42,945
- All right, I'm in. Now what?
- <i>Okay, good.</i>

615
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,869
De-authorize and delete all directories,
just like I showed you.

616
00:36:56,408 --> 00:36:57,447
It's done.

617
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,182
Manticore is dead.

618
00:37:07,803 --> 00:37:09,017
That's not possible.

619
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,727
I changed the password.

620
00:37:11,986 --> 00:37:15,276
- This is another trick.
- Is it? Or is it badger85?

621
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:16,775
That's the new password!

622
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:21,613
But I just changed it!
How could you know it?!

623
00:37:21,932 --> 00:37:24,992
Well, you know, it turns out, just like
high school, you can be pushed around.

624
00:37:30,567 --> 00:37:32,209
Neuro-linguistic programming.

625
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:34,608
It's amazing what you can do
with the power of suggestion.

626
00:37:34,932 --> 00:37:37,921
Say, wasn't
that Mrs. Zavransky's room?

627
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,716
It's right here on my badge.
Are you sure?

628
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:43,278
I wore glasses since I was 8.

629
00:37:43,403 --> 00:37:44,887
Five years ago...

630
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,212
It wasn't all bad...

631
00:37:46,337 --> 00:37:48,640
Did your brain just hold
onto all the painful...

632
00:37:49,328 --> 00:37:52,686
I already ate. Five months
of dieting to fit into this...

633
00:37:57,506 --> 00:37:59,693
Badger, badger, badger, '85!

634
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,255
You hacked me?

635
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:10,871
You got inside my head?

636
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,996
We did save your life!

637
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:24,384
- What's the matter, Schmitty?
- Holy crap! They're out of beer!

638
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:31,121
- He's got a gun!
- FBI! Freeze!

639
00:38:34,551 --> 00:38:36,012
Let go of me!

640
00:38:37,854 --> 00:38:39,593
What are you staring at?

641
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:42,319
I'm better than you.

642
00:38:43,769 --> 00:38:45,935
I'm better than all of you!

643
00:38:46,412 --> 00:38:48,617
I'm Larry Duberman!

644
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,008
Doucherman.

645
00:38:55,345 --> 00:38:57,879
I suppose the FBI
received an anonymous tip.

646
00:38:58,004 --> 00:39:01,014
Well, yeah, I mean, between the files
that Eliot just e-mailed them...

647
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:02,669
And the ledger from the cafe...

648
00:39:02,794 --> 00:39:05,180
Duberman's looking
at a lot of time in detention.

649
00:39:05,305 --> 00:39:09,012
And with Manticore gone, Cyrus'
people are one step closer to freedom.

650
00:39:12,068 --> 00:39:14,464
I already told Cyrus
Manticore's destroyed.

651
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:16,937
I'm sure he's spreading
the good news right now.

652
00:39:37,483 --> 00:39:39,546
I think it's time we graduate.

653
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:42,271
Your votes are in for the
king and queen of the reunion!

654
00:39:42,396 --> 00:39:44,268
And the lucky winner is...

655
00:39:44,393 --> 00:39:46,800
Grace Peltz and Drake Mcintyre!

656
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,447
Mac attack! Yeah!

657
00:39:56,037 --> 00:39:57,492
Very funny, Hardison.

658
00:39:57,617 --> 00:39:59,214
You're thinking I did this?

659
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:02,441
Man, I don't rig elections.
I mean, I could, but...

660
00:40:02,614 --> 00:40:03,775
Parker...

661
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,077
<i>Was this you?</i>

662
00:40:05,641 --> 00:40:08,196
I didn't even know they had
kings and queens in high school.

663
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:13,146
- Hey, Mac.
- I guess it was a good con.

664
00:40:14,741 --> 00:40:16,419
- Mac attack!
- Here's your crown!

665
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,712
Thank you.

666
00:40:18,628 --> 00:40:20,709
Hardison, why don't you maybe...

667
00:40:21,738 --> 00:40:25,348
- set off a fire alarm about now?
- <i>You two enjoy this. She earned it.</i>

668
00:40:25,473 --> 00:40:28,219
Grace Peltz and Drake McIntyre.

669
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:48,595
So you think we would have
been a couple in high school?

670
00:40:49,652 --> 00:40:53,013
Grace Peltz
and the great Drake McIntyre?

671
00:40:53,223 --> 00:40:56,620
- Don't think so.
- No, no. Nate Ford and...

672
00:41:01,573 --> 00:41:02,953
Don't ruin the mood.

673
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:12,594
May I have this dance, miss?

674
00:41:23,986 --> 00:41:25,900
So this is
what high school was like.

675
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:30,340
Pretty much.

676
00:41:32,013 --> 00:41:33,073
Hello?

677
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:34,972
Everybody having
a good time at the dance?

678
00:41:35,097 --> 00:41:37,037
Anybody wonder if Eliot made it out?

679
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:41,790
Does anybody wonder
if Eliot's alive?

680
00:41:42,503 --> 00:41:43,503
Hello?
