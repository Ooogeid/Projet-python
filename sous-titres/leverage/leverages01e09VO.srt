00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,010

00:00:19,373 --> 00:00:21,605

not in front 
my family

10
00:00:23,768 --> 00:00:26,838
The bank sold the loan

11
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:29,815
sold it? to who?

12
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:37,699
My Contractor

13
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:41,211

and he steal it from me ?

00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:43,095

Really sorry

00:00:51,421 --> 00:00:55,631
mr.retzing i whant to talk to you
for one minutes please

17
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,468
Oh my god

18
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,539
Put your hands behind your back

19
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:12,050


20
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:14,099
See, first katrina hit,

21
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:17,075
But my unit got called up.

22
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:19,656
My house was too trashed for me to fix,

23
00:01:19,703 --> 00:01:21,532
Not in the time i had.

24
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:23,958
So that's when you hired retzing?

25
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,307
I couldn't really afford him,

26
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,231
But i had to get on a plane to fallujah.

27
00:01:29,936 --> 00:01:32,680
So retzing tells me
i could take out, uh...

28
00:01:32,727 --> 00:01:35,564
an equity loan to cover your costs.

29
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,728
Three months ago, i get
back off my second tour.

30
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:42,123
Couldn't make the loan payments,
and the house lost value

31
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,914
Because he didn't
make the repairs right.

32
00:01:45,598 --> 00:01:47,542
Mr. Ford...

33
00:01:47,798 --> 00:01:50,240
this was our first house.

34
00:01:51,565 --> 00:01:54,166
He took my little boy's home.

35
00:01:55,932 --> 00:01:58,032
Do you have any kids?

36
00:01:58,543 --> 00:02:00,124
I did.

37
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:02,078
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,078
Whatever happened, i know
you did everything you could.

39
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:08,055
That's what gets me.

40
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:11,832
You work hard, you play by the rules,

41
00:02:12,311 --> 00:02:14,565
But when you
need help --

42
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,699
Really need help...

43
00:02:18,149 --> 00:02:20,195
...they let you hang.

44
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,731
They let you hang, and it's
your kid who pays the price.

45
00:02:28,964 --> 00:02:31,033
No!

46
00:02:31,871 --> 00:02:34,033
Yeah, we, uh...

47
00:02:35,452 --> 00:02:38,151
we all pay the price.

48
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:41,267
(???) Where the hell is he at?

49
00:02:41,314 --> 00:02:42,709
Maybe he overslept.

50
00:02:42,732 --> 00:02:44,476
No. He doesn't oversleep.

51
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,686
This guy sets an alarm to set his alarm.

52
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:49,593
A man with one watch knows the time.

53
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:52,408
A man with two is never sure.

54
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:53,547
Huh?

55
00:02:53,594 --> 00:02:55,803
I had fortune cookies for breakfast.

56
00:02:56,966 --> 00:02:59,524
- Okay, run it.
- ??

57
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,105
???

58
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:03,315
Do you put milk on the fortune cookies?

59
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,060
- It's not cereal. It's a fortune cookie.
- You don't dunk it.

60
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:10,099
Whoa, no chatter today.
Just -- Just run it.

61
00:03:12,897 --> 00:03:14,525
Henry
retzing --

62
00:03:14,548 --> 00:03:16,734
Contractor, self-Made millionaire,

63
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:18,782
All-Around dirtbag.

64
00:03:18,805 --> 00:03:21,596
Now henry has construction
contracts all over florida,

65
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:23,828
Mostly residential, some commercial.

66
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,526
But the man is as crooked
as the day is long.

67
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,765
You okay?

68
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,108
Are you all right?

69
00:03:30,154 --> 00:03:31,666
Oh, yeah, yeah.

70
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,481
What scam did he run on the scotts?

71
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:36,527
It's sharp. See, retzing
took the contract.

72
00:03:36,574 --> 00:03:39,598
Now, he did shoddy work,
and he stretched out the job.

73
00:03:39,643 --> 00:03:40,799
And after about a year,

74
00:03:40,832 --> 00:03:43,178
The scotts, like any
other law-Abiding folks,

75
00:03:43,202 --> 00:03:44,946
They just said, "okay, you know what?

76
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:46,598
We're not gonna pay this guy."

77
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:48,732
But when they did that,

78
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:51,132
Retzing put a contractor
lien on the property.

79
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,066
Oh. Once the scotts ran out of money...

80
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,575
retzing became creditor,

81
00:03:54,621 --> 00:03:56,831
Took ownership of the house
when the bank foreclosed.

82
00:03:56,877 --> 00:03:57,761
Slimy.

83
00:03:57,807 --> 00:04:01,297
Yes, but all of it absolutely legal.

84
00:04:01,436 --> 00:04:02,715
Are you drunk?

85
00:04:02,762 --> 00:04:04,227
???

86
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,018
Technically, no. I was
drunk a couple hours ago.

87
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:09,166
Now i'm just hung over.

88
00:04:09,506 --> 00:04:13,809
The florida attorney general's office
investigated the retzings a few years back,

89
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,321
But they couldn't make anything stick.

90
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:18,532
So the game is, get the
scotts their house back.

91
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:20,019
All right, what's the way in?

92
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:22,716
The sons in
retzing and sons --

93
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,019
Randy and dennis.???

94
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,042
I thought we had an agreement.

95
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:28,624
What agreement?

96
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:30,904
That you'd sort yourself out.

97
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,904
You see, randy, the oldest
one, he doesn't do much

98
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,532
Except snowboard and judge
snowy wet t-Shirt contests.

99
00:04:36,565 --> 00:04:38,732
I don't remember making a deal.

100
00:04:38,765 --> 00:04:40,021
- No?
- No.

101
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:41,932
That's what we're afraid of.

102
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:46,277
Dennis, the "willy wonka"
worker bee -- Mba from duke.

103
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,393
Now, his father, he's the
public face of the company,

104
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,393
But this man does all the grunt work.

105
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,486
Oh, okay, okay.

106
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:56,906
All right, so, they beat
a state investigation,

107
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,952
So they're smart.

108
00:04:58,975 --> 00:05:00,719
They have the law on their side,

109
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,498
So they're untouchable.

110
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:07,699
Or so they think.

111
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:10,965
Randy is the sloppy one.

112
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:13,832
Sophie, how's your luge?

113
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:15,163
My what?

114
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:17,163
Your luge?

115
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:18,790

Oh, what the hell does he
know about extreme, huh?

121
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:41,932
No, i don't care what
picabo and brody think, eh?

122
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:43,676
I see you at the party.

123
00:05:45,397 --> 00:05:47,932

125
00:05:57,765 --> 00:05:58,980
Hansel's after gretel.

126
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,701
Got it.

127
00:06:09,376 --> 00:06:11,841
???

128
00:06:16,144 --> 00:06:18,699
Sorry, ute ausgatner.

129
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:23,168
???

130
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:25,866
??

131
00:06:25,912 --> 00:06:29,773
???

132
00:06:44,286 --> 00:06:46,077
It's a bar.

133
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,147
I'm blending.

134
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,147
???

135
00:06:57,218 --> 00:06:59,869
I think you left this behind.

136
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:02,613
Oh, my god.

137
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,148
<i>My life is in this book. Danke schoen.</i>

138
00:07:05,357 --> 00:07:07,706
My pleasure. And can i just say?

139
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:09,404
Huge fan.

140
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:10,799
- Really?
- Absolutely.

141
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:14,132
Luge -- I live for it
-- The speed, the ice,

142
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:17,298
All that...latex,

143
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,870
The, uh, helmet.

144
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:24,598
So, what i'm saying is, and this
is the big one, the big idea,

145
00:07:24,632 --> 00:07:25,801
Imagine the "x" games,

146
00:07:25,848 --> 00:07:28,336
But more slam dancy and
more south by southwest-Ish.

147
00:07:28,383 --> 00:07:31,615
Throw in a little burning man.

148
00:07:31,662 --> 00:07:33,406
Boom.

149
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:37,032
Boom?

150
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:38,699
Yeah.

151
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:42,799
You know, my partners and i
have just purchased this resort.

152
00:07:42,832 --> 00:07:45,616
Yeah, we're renovating
it to be state-Of-The-Art.

153
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,663
You know, your little idea could be

154
00:07:47,686 --> 00:07:50,244
The perfect high-Profile
event for the relaunch.

155
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:52,361
Damn straight.

156
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:55,710
Okay, good, good. Now
ease him into the buy-In.

157
00:07:55,757 --> 00:07:58,132
Of course, you'd have to
buy in to our little group.

158
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,298
According to their records, they only
have a couple hundred grand liquid,

159
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:03,408
So you're gonna have to
just string him along.

160
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:04,710
Don't push him too hard.

161
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:08,331
How about i just write
you a check for $500,000?

162
00:08:10,398 --> 00:08:12,765
"My partners would be delighted."

163
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,944
My partners and i would be delighted.

164
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,432
Great.

165
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,386
But i'll have to see the
plans, talk to management.

166
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,271
Of course. You want to go now?

167
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:22,759
Why not?

168
00:08:23,387 --> 00:08:24,598
This is good.

169
00:08:24,632 --> 00:08:27,665
The sooner you're happy, the
sooner you write that check.

170
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:29,765
Shall we?

171
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:31,085
Yeah.

172
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,932
Okay, let's go steal us a mountain.

173
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:42,504
Here we got to make
room for heli-Skiing pad,

174
00:08:42,551 --> 00:08:45,526
You know, all the usual,
you know, spa's facilities.

175
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:47,808
We're gonna have the heated plunge pools

176
00:08:47,854 --> 00:08:50,575
And the jacuzzis and the hot tubs.

177
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,668
- Ski in, ski out?
- Yeah. Boom?

178
00:08:54,273 --> 00:08:55,900
Boom.

179
00:08:57,529 --> 00:08:59,412
Okay, eliot, you're up.

180
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:03,111
Hi, how are you?

181
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:04,762
Mike rockman. Welcome to powder bear.

182
00:09:04,785 --> 00:09:07,413
Vince fetkey -- Innovative
resort solutions.

183
00:09:07,437 --> 00:09:09,344
Just don't call us the i.R.S.

184
00:09:12,646 --> 00:09:14,367
Okay, hang the lift.

185
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:30,904
Space mountain is now closed.

186
00:09:31,566 --> 00:09:34,267
Okay, parker. Go.

187
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,000
Parker?

188
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:46,207
Parker?

189
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:47,765
Parker? What are you doing?

190
00:09:47,812 --> 00:09:49,324
Oh, yeah.

191
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:51,800
Help. Help.

192
00:09:52,975 --> 00:09:54,137
???

193
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,906
Oh, geez.

194
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,867
And unlike conventional fireplaces,

195
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:01,034
These have marshmallow
toasting rods already built in

196
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,534
And retractable
-- Brand-New.

197
00:10:03,673 --> 00:10:05,952
Oh, excuse me for a second.

198
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,325
Yeah?

199
00:10:10,256 --> 00:10:11,666
What?

200
00:10:12,047 --> 00:10:13,674
Lift four? Is she hurt?

201
00:10:14,256 --> 00:10:16,605
No, call ski patrol.
I'll be right there.

202
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:18,116
Can you excuse me for just a minute?

203
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,395
Yeah, yeah, take your time, please.

204
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:48,560
Whoo-Hee.

205
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:49,816
Leena, oh.

206
00:10:49,863 --> 00:10:51,631
???

207
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,120
Mwah. Mwah. Mwah.

208
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,329
???

209
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,654
??

210
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:59,633
Oh, hans, this is randy retzing.

211
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,445
Yeah, he's thinking about
joining our little group.

212
00:11:01,492 --> 00:11:03,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

213
00:11:03,678 --> 00:11:06,700
Oh, come on, dude, are
you ready to rock this?

214
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,733
Yeah.

215
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:12,376
So, what about parker?

216
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:14,818
Parker's safe.

217
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,865
Of course, these are
just the preliminaries.

218
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:18,004
Awesome
--

219
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:20,378
Just make sure to leave some room
for hot tubs and the dance floor.

220
00:11:20,424 --> 00:11:22,540
Mm, ah.

221
00:11:23,587 --> 00:11:28,657
So, uh, you can write
that little check now, eh?

222
00:11:28,703 --> 00:11:31,234
Hey, why can't they all be this easy?

223
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:33,774
Of course not. We have to go to miami.

224
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,890
My dad's the one who
has to write the check.

225
00:11:35,937 --> 00:11:38,401
Aw, hell, why they all
got to be this hard?

226
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:39,681
Miami?

227
00:11:39,704 --> 00:11:42,167
Well, not right away.

228
00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:45,566
Maybe do a little tandem luge runs.

229
00:11:47,008 --> 00:11:48,728
Wear the helmet.

230
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:03,102
???

231
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,333
A little something extra...

232
00:12:09,334 --> 00:12:10,566
for you.

233
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:13,078
Randy.

234
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:17,126
So, where you been
this time -- Europe?

235
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:18,126
No.

236
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:19,754
- Caribbean?
- No.

237
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,289
Well, give me the dirty details.

238
00:12:21,335 --> 00:12:25,134
Just some skiing. Dad,
meet leena christinger.

239
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,685
<i>Guten tag.</i>

240
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,334
French.

241
00:12:29,546 --> 00:12:31,267
Nice.

242
00:12:32,243 --> 00:12:34,801
Parker, get me some video.

243
00:12:43,849 --> 00:12:45,100
Okay, okay, here it is.

244
00:12:45,134 --> 00:12:46,896
Here's the project,
and leena loves this.

245
00:12:46,942 --> 00:12:48,082
Right, leena? Mm-Hmm.

246
00:12:48,128 --> 00:12:52,547
Yes. It's winter sports
and a music festival.

247
00:12:52,593 --> 00:12:54,467
And i'm calling it...

248
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:57,867
the winter edge games.

249
00:13:01,338 --> 00:13:02,920
That's brilliant.

250
00:13:02,943 --> 00:13:05,478
Dream big, build big.

251
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:08,234
That's what made this
company what it is today.

252
00:13:08,502 --> 00:13:10,234
Isn't that right, dennis?

253
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:12,944
Sure. It's not like solid management

254
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:15,386
And an aggressive business
plan had anything to do with it.

255
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:17,867
Oh, get over here. Sit down, sit.

256
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,533
Now, here's what i want to know.

257
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:22,566
What do you need to
make this thing happen?

258
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,167
Because i want you to know,
i am with you 130% on this.

259
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,620
I think it's a really,
really exciting project.

260
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,900
Yeah, it's part of a worldwide plan.

261
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,644
- Ow. What's that?
- It's weird. Parker.

262
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,132
Signal's dirty here, too.

263
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:41,574
Are they jamming the signal?

264
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:44,458
No, the vhf output frequency is clean.

265
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:46,900
For some reason, our transmission's
just not getting to her.

266
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:50,267
I think the interference is
coming from inside the house.

267
00:13:50,645 --> 00:13:52,365
Eliot,

268
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:55,157
I need you to
plant a booster --

269
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,040
The offices on the second floor,

270
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:10,018
I want you to give your
brother whatever it is he needs.

271
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:12,646
- Are you sure that's
a good -- - I love it.

272
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,633
Now, we could use a little more
creative thinking around here, all right?

273
00:14:16,948 --> 00:14:18,531
Well, as president of your company,

274
00:14:18,554 --> 00:14:20,298
I have to sign off on
the checks, as well.

275
00:14:20,345 --> 00:14:23,484
Okay, w-- Did i ask
for a play-By-Play?

276
00:14:23,508 --> 00:14:24,601
Come on.

277
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:27,633
I want you to go sign the
checks, check the numbers.

278
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,019
Do your job.

279
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:30,089
Do you want to help him out?

280
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,555
Of course.

281
00:14:32,765 --> 00:14:34,134
<i>Danke schoen.</i>

282
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,160
??

283
00:14:41,183 --> 00:14:45,184
It must be quite a challenge managing
a business as big as your family's.

284
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,833
Not everyone seems to think so.

285
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:49,231
Although, power doesn't
have to show off.

286
00:14:49,277 --> 00:14:51,800
When you have it, you know it.

287
00:14:54,231 --> 00:14:56,161
All right, guys, they're
going to the second floor.

288
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,324
Work fast.

289
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,566
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

290
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:07,300
What do you see in him?

291
00:15:07,334 --> 00:15:09,860
<i>Who --
Randy? Nein.</i>

292
00:15:09,883 --> 00:15:11,931
Between us, it's strictly business.

293
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,267
Well, does he know that?

294
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,100
Does it matter? I make my own choices.

295
00:15:36,677 --> 00:15:38,305
Holy...

296
00:15:38,723 --> 00:15:40,909
damn it, parker.

297
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:42,654
A little warning next time.

298
00:15:42,677 --> 00:15:44,142
How'd you even know i'd be there?

299
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:46,134
I didn't.

300
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,933
Is it working?

301
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:52,633
$500,000...

302
00:15:53,748 --> 00:15:57,027
signed by my father...

303
00:15:57,492 --> 00:15:59,887
and cosigned by me.

304
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,911
You can't be serious. You're too smart.

305
00:16:03,934 --> 00:16:06,073
You have to see what my brother's like.

306
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:10,566
Look, just -- Just look at
some of his other big ideas.

307
00:16:11,284 --> 00:16:13,933
Hot-Air-Balloon
paintball.

308
00:16:14,493 --> 00:16:16,267
Submarine cruises.

309
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,609
Oh, fruit-Flavored pizza sauces.

310
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:21,234
Is this who you want
to get into bed with?

311
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:25,000
If you're talking business,

312
00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:28,100
Then i'm always open
to new opportunities.

313
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:30,234
But if you're talking
on a personal level,

314
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:32,982
Then let's just say i prefer a man

315
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:36,657
Who knows what it means to be...

316
00:16:36,658 --> 00:16:38,633
in control.

317
00:16:42,611 --> 00:16:44,379
All yours.

318
00:16:48,264 --> 00:16:50,967
I made retzing and sons what it is.

319
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,067
I turned disaster-Area
relief into a growth industry.

320
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,543
Disaster area?

321
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:58,533
Yeah, people need their homes fixed,

322
00:16:58,845 --> 00:17:02,358
So we lowball a quote,
slap some spackle around,

323
00:17:02,404 --> 00:17:04,867
And up the bill when they complain.

324
00:17:05,404 --> 00:17:07,800
When they can't pay anymore,
we put a lien on the property.

325
00:17:07,823 --> 00:17:10,125
Eventually, they get foreclosed on.

326
00:17:10,241 --> 00:17:12,521
We buy the houses for a song.

327
00:17:14,055 --> 00:17:15,522
They've done this to more
people than the scotts.

328
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:18,666
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sophie,
find out how many.

329
00:17:19,126 --> 00:17:21,067
And how big is your operation?

330
00:17:21,824 --> 00:17:24,080
Mmm, 400 homes, give or take.

331
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,731
400?

332
00:17:25,777 --> 00:17:26,940
Yeah, all over
the country --

333
00:17:26,987 --> 00:17:29,430
Tornadoes in oklahoma,
florida hurricanes.

334
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,569
And katrina was like
winning the damn lottery.

335
00:17:33,918 --> 00:17:35,833
All right, sophie,
do not take the check.

336
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:37,566
- What?!What?!
- Sorry, what?

337
00:17:38,127 --> 00:17:39,639
Now, don't tell me this
makes you squeamish,

338
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:41,267
'Cause it's all legal.

339
00:17:41,313 --> 00:17:44,710
I just found a... a loophole.

340
00:17:45,152 --> 00:17:49,082
I said, "do not take the money."

341
00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:57,034
Now, you tell him this.

342
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,434
If what you're saying is
you want to do real business,

343
00:18:01,467 --> 00:18:03,222
Then i might have an
opportunity for you,

344
00:18:03,246 --> 00:18:05,455
But it's for serious investors only.

345
00:18:05,478 --> 00:18:08,571
This is not something i would
ever present to your brother.

346
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:11,000
Interesting.

347
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:12,805
What are you doing?

348
00:18:12,851 --> 00:18:15,247
Forget about the money.

349
00:18:15,293 --> 00:18:17,014
No, we don't want the money.
We're gonna take the company.

350
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:18,828
We're gonna give each of these
people back their own homes.

351
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,267
You made this decision when?

352
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,933
All the pretty money.

353
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,969
I don't have to run
anything by you, eliot.

354
00:18:24,992 --> 00:18:27,760
Shut -- Shut -- Shut
up, shut up.Guys,

355
00:18:27,783 --> 00:18:29,034
The interference
earlier --

356
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,946
There's a signal coming from in there.

357
00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:34,034
Now, the output frequency is
around the 120 megahertz range,

358
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:35,225
But the transmitter,
the transmitter --

359
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:36,899
Cut the geek.

360
00:18:37,178 --> 00:18:39,295
The house is bugged.

361
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:41,365
Now, if i'm right,

362
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,993
The equipment is
standard-Issue law enforcement.

363
00:18:45,598 --> 00:18:47,334
Yeah.

364
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,644
Cops are listening.

365
00:18:54,273 --> 00:18:56,041
???

366
00:18:56,064 --> 00:18:57,831
Hardison, where were
you when it mattered?

367
00:18:57,855 --> 00:19:00,622
He asked me to tear up the
check, so i tore up the check.

368
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:04,064
I didn't make the decision to throw
away everybody else's money, okay?

369
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:05,391
That was you and nate.
Y'all are in cahoots.

370
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:07,321
Hey, listen, i don't like it.

371
00:19:07,344 --> 00:19:09,437
Cops mean too many variables.

372
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,298
Then what are you gonna
tell the scotts, nate, huh?

373
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:13,204
How are we gonna explain
to them that we -- We --

374
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:14,809
We tore up their future.

375
00:19:14,832 --> 00:19:15,832
He doesn't know.

376
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:18,371
And who's gonna tell that guy
we had a house for his baby boy

377
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:19,927
And you just gave it away?

378
00:19:19,973 --> 00:19:22,438
You're the one who's always telling
us we're doing this for the client.

379
00:19:22,485 --> 00:19:25,274
One client...

380
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:27,438
many victims.

381
00:19:27,461 --> 00:19:31,504
We have a chance to represent
those who couldn't ask for our help.

382
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:36,067
And besides, we're going
with a much bigger scam --

383
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:38,406
One of the classics.

384
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:41,137
- The london spank?
- The genevan paso doble.

385
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,881
The apple pie.

386
00:19:46,092 --> 00:19:48,374
It's like the cherry
pie, but with lifeguards.

387
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:54,439
Glengarry glen death.

388
00:19:54,905 --> 00:19:58,557
It's like a --
A mutual fund,

389
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:01,940
But instead of stocks,
you invest in --

390
00:20:02,232 --> 00:20:04,240
In death.

391
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,488
I-Is it me, or is he getting creepier?

392
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,303
Glengarry glen death
-- It's really simple.

393
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,837
See,

394
00:20:19,838 --> 00:20:21,973
You're joe average, all right?

395
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:23,838
You find out you got
a fatal disease --

396
00:20:23,884 --> 00:20:25,675
Months, maybe weeks to live.

397
00:20:25,722 --> 00:20:28,118
You want to make your
last days special, hmm?

398
00:20:28,397 --> 00:20:30,816
You know, take the wife
on the dream cruise,

399
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:33,839
Travel the world, spend
time with the kids.

400
00:20:33,885 --> 00:20:37,862
But 9 out of 10 people, they
tap out all their savings

401
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:41,095
During the preliminary treatments.

402
00:20:41,234 --> 00:20:43,026
So, you know, there you are.

403
00:20:43,073 --> 00:20:45,793
You're gonna die, and you're broke.

404
00:20:45,817 --> 00:20:49,398
But there's a big fat insurance
policy just sitting there useless,

405
00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:51,026
So what we do, our group,

406
00:20:51,073 --> 00:20:53,910
We buy the policy pennies on the dollar.

407
00:20:54,142 --> 00:20:55,840
They get a chunk of change now.

408
00:20:55,873 --> 00:20:59,107
And -- And we get the
payout postmortem, right?

409
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,562
He gets to enjoy his last days,

410
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:04,864
And we get to enjoy a
healthy profit, right?

411
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,120
Nate worked insurance for 20 years.

412
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:09,726
He came to us with
some useful information.

413
00:21:09,749 --> 00:21:12,439
Yeah, you know what i have?
Do you know what i have?

414
00:21:12,473 --> 00:21:15,726
I have detailed actuarial tables

415
00:21:15,749 --> 00:21:18,819
And a confidential
database of sick people.

416
00:21:18,865 --> 00:21:21,506
Now, by cross-Referencing them,

417
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:24,285
I've created a short list right here

418
00:21:24,332 --> 00:21:26,207
Of people with fat policies

419
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:29,099
That are all gonna die
within six months, you know.

420
00:21:29,146 --> 00:21:30,936
Are you listening to this, right?

421
00:21:30,983 --> 00:21:32,680
I mean, this is it. This is right here.

422
00:21:32,727 --> 00:21:34,797
This is for you. This
is, you know, gonna do it.

423
00:21:34,843 --> 00:21:36,612
This will quadruple your money.

424
00:21:36,658 --> 00:21:39,426
Nate has already a select
number of investors,

425
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:41,077
But with your contribution,

426
00:21:41,123 --> 00:21:43,402
He can buy up even more policies.

427
00:21:46,658 --> 00:21:49,573
No, no, it's too risky.

428
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,776
You can't control when
they're gonna croak.

429
00:21:52,822 --> 00:21:54,845
Are you -- Are
you listening?

430
00:21:54,892 --> 00:21:57,520
I mean, this list
-- This list is gold.

431
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:01,040
I'm tell-- Okay, look,
here we go. We got...

432
00:22:01,073 --> 00:22:03,357
...pancreatic cancer, oregon,

433
00:22:03,403 --> 00:22:08,567
And you've got a non-Hodgkins
lymphoma in jersey.

434
00:22:08,614 --> 00:22:11,140
You know how i got this rolex?

435
00:22:11,173 --> 00:22:14,207
40-Year-Old
steelworker, melanoma.

436
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,374
All right, i want
independent confirmation.

437
00:22:16,406 --> 00:22:18,034
- All right.
- I want a doctor,

438
00:22:18,057 --> 00:22:21,173
One i choose, to verify prognosis.

439
00:22:22,685 --> 00:22:25,073
Okay, fair enough.

440
00:22:26,266 --> 00:22:29,243
But just one condition, though.

441
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:32,606
No one gets a look at this
list without a little buy-In.

442
00:22:33,546 --> 00:22:35,360
$10,000 up front?

443
00:22:35,407 --> 00:22:37,406
Fine.

444
00:22:40,802 --> 00:22:42,895
Pick one, any one.

445
00:22:43,081 --> 00:22:46,222
Lisa valdez --
Inoperable brain tumor

446
00:22:46,826 --> 00:22:48,207
Right here in miami.

447
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,850
Well, good choice. I'll set it up.

448
00:22:54,245 --> 00:22:56,706
You just bring the doctor, all right?

449
00:23:01,665 --> 00:23:03,073
You friggin' weasel.

450
00:23:03,107 --> 00:23:05,409
All you were supposed to
do was write the check.

451
00:23:05,455 --> 00:23:07,246
And i did.

452
00:23:07,874 --> 00:23:09,944
<i>Just ask the fraeulein.</i>

453
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:11,439
- Leena?
- Uh-Huh.

454
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,689
What are you doing there?

455
00:23:12,735 --> 00:23:14,154
<i>I'm sorry, liebchen.</i>

456
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:16,828
We decided to go in
a different direction.

457
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:18,247
What did you say to her?

458
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,782
Well, i don't know what
you're talking about.

459
00:23:19,828 --> 00:23:22,247
I just watch the numbers, remember?

460
00:23:22,294 --> 00:23:24,173
Oh, dennis, you little ass.

461
00:23:24,207 --> 00:23:26,364
What do you think dad's gonna
say when i come back home?

462
00:23:26,411 --> 00:23:28,318
Oh, i'm sorry. We're losing you.

463
00:23:28,364 --> 00:23:31,318
Your strip joint must be
driving through a tunnel.

464
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,178
No that is what i call control.

465
00:23:38,202 --> 00:23:39,840
Yeah.

466
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,473
Okay.

467
00:24:16,135 --> 00:24:18,840
Hey, what seems
to be the prob--

468
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:24,369
Okay, cheap tie, bad aftershave.

469
00:24:24,415 --> 00:24:28,640
Now, why would the state police be
interested in my business, lieutenant...?

470
00:24:28,673 --> 00:24:30,340
- Stone.
- Stone.

471
00:24:30,374 --> 00:24:32,840
Racketeering and corruption task force.

472
00:24:33,835 --> 00:24:35,788
What business do you
have here in florida?

473
00:24:35,835 --> 00:24:38,840
You know, i like the outlet malls.

474
00:24:38,873 --> 00:24:41,835
We know you just came from a
meeting with dennis retzing.

475
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:44,928
What i want to know is,
why is an insurance guy

476
00:24:44,974 --> 00:24:47,091
Trying to make a deal with that family?

477
00:24:47,114 --> 00:24:49,952
Racketeering? Are you kidding me?

478
00:24:50,045 --> 00:24:52,138
You're trying to get
them on a rico charge?

479
00:24:52,185 --> 00:24:54,348
What, you couldn't get
them on the fraud, so you --

480
00:24:54,394 --> 00:24:56,240
Wow, man, that's desperate.

481
00:24:56,274 --> 00:24:57,673
We are gonna get the retzings.

482
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:02,698
Now, if you and your, uh... people

483
00:25:02,721 --> 00:25:05,651
Are still around when
the hammer comes down,

484
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:07,840
We're not gonna stop
and sort things out.

485
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,140
Right, but, you know,

486
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:11,023
You wouldn't be talking
to me if you had anything.

487
00:25:11,046 --> 00:25:12,651
You're fishing.

488
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:15,628
You're fishing, right?

489
00:25:23,513 --> 00:25:26,071
I know two things about you, mr. Ford.

490
00:25:26,978 --> 00:25:30,374
You're trouble, and you're a drunk.

491
00:25:30,406 --> 00:25:31,573
Wow.

492
00:25:34,862 --> 00:25:37,397
Either one is enough
for me not to trust you.

493
00:25:41,002 --> 00:25:43,406
Yeah, that certainly kind of hurt.

494
00:25:53,515 --> 00:25:55,050
???

495
00:25:57,167 --> 00:25:58,795
Why do i have to be the patient?

496
00:25:58,841 --> 00:26:00,609
Because he picked a woman's name.

497
00:26:00,655 --> 00:26:02,492
And i can't play both parts.

498
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:04,516
- So you get the tumor.
- Where have you been?

499
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:07,140
- Everything okay?
- Fine.

500
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:09,539
Okay, people, hacking
into the imaging computer

501
00:26:09,573 --> 00:26:12,284
Is simple enough, but
i've run some simulations,

502
00:26:12,331 --> 00:26:15,331
And i don't think i can ghost an image
that will pass a doctor's inspection.

503
00:26:15,377 --> 00:26:18,940
Okay, well, can we give
her a fake tumor, or...?

504
00:26:18,973 --> 00:26:21,494
Well, we could inject her
brain with some contrast dye,

505
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,889
Have it pool into her cranial cavity,

506
00:26:23,935 --> 00:26:26,983
- But there might be some side effects.
- Like what?

507
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,681
Organ failure, death,
death-Like symptoms.

508
00:26:29,704 --> 00:26:31,169
I vote for plan "b."

509
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:33,634
You know, we could get another chamber,

510
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:36,076
And then put a brain
with a tumor in that one

511
00:26:36,123 --> 00:26:38,752
And then send the signal to
the monitor for this chamber.

512
00:26:40,868 --> 00:26:42,868
Cross the wires.

513
00:26:45,077 --> 00:26:46,519
What?

514
00:26:46,542 --> 00:26:48,340
I dated a neurologist.

515
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:52,125
There's a machine in the next suite.

516
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:53,740
I could tap that.

517
00:26:53,773 --> 00:26:55,073
Great.

518
00:26:55,107 --> 00:26:58,173
Now all we have to do is
find a brain with a tumor.

519
00:26:58,207 --> 00:27:00,450
Bolus of semi-Solid fluid

520
00:27:00,474 --> 00:27:03,473
Injected into one of the
ventricles -- That should do it.

521
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:06,661
Man, we need some hot wax.

522
00:27:06,707 --> 00:27:08,800
Oh, and a cadaver.

523
00:27:09,149 --> 00:27:10,640
Okay.

524
00:27:11,498 --> 00:27:13,777
- Let's get to work. - Whoa, you're
not seriously thinking about --

525
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,673
What we need to do is, we
need to secure this chamber

526
00:27:17,706 --> 00:27:20,007
And the one next to it,

527
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,964
Have to make sure that the coms work

528
00:27:21,987 --> 00:27:24,140
With the magnetic interference,

529
00:27:24,173 --> 00:27:26,374
Set up a meeting with the retzings.

530
00:27:29,545 --> 00:27:31,640
Somebody find me a brain.

531
00:27:34,374 --> 00:27:36,406
Oh, yeah.

532
00:27:36,523 --> 00:27:39,058
He's definitely getting creepier.

533
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,826
???

534
00:27:43,846 --> 00:27:46,315
Hardison, are we ready?

535
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:49,780
Just call me the scarecrow.
I'm ready to rock.

536
00:27:50,245 --> 00:27:52,338
Now, if i only had a brain.

537
00:27:52,385 --> 00:27:54,222
???

538
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:55,989
Yeah. Almost there.

539
00:27:56,036 --> 00:27:57,617
Did you
get the --

540
00:27:57,664 --> 00:27:58,641
Yep.

541
00:27:58,687 --> 00:27:59,594
Where?

542
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:01,270
You really want to know?

543
00:28:01,316 --> 00:28:03,293
No, not really. No.

544
00:28:07,897 --> 00:28:09,944
Sophie, is the patient ready?

545
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,572
She's at death's door.

546
00:28:11,618 --> 00:28:13,992
Oh, this is fun.

547
00:28:14,201 --> 00:28:16,852
Hey, do you need a minute to prepare?

548
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,340
You know, death scenes can be demanding.

549
00:28:19,387 --> 00:28:22,712
I remember this time i was
playing camille in summer stock,

550
00:28:23,829 --> 00:28:27,061
And, oh, i was drained
after every performance.

551
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,132
Don't i just make believe i'm dying?

552
00:28:30,434 --> 00:28:35,551
Okay, you need to own
the space and -- And...

553
00:28:36,225 --> 00:28:38,830
access your sense memory.

554
00:28:38,876 --> 00:28:40,109
Here, try this.

555
00:28:40,155 --> 00:28:43,505
Think of, um, a really sad thing
that's happened in your life,

556
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,807
Like, i don't know,

557
00:28:45,808 --> 00:28:47,970
When your father died.

558
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,622
Yeah.

559
00:28:51,668 --> 00:28:54,156
This isn't gonna be easy.

560
00:28:55,716 --> 00:28:57,948
Ah, good to see you.

561
00:28:57,995 --> 00:28:59,204
- How are you?
- Very well.

562
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:00,623
Dr. Kwan.

563
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:02,412
Nice to meet you.

564
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:04,972
Well, how's your day?

565
00:29:05,065 --> 00:29:06,344
It's good. Shall we do this?

566
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,157
- Yeah, let's do this.
- ???

567
00:29:08,996 --> 00:29:10,949
After you.

568
00:29:19,577 --> 00:29:20,856
What?

569
00:29:20,903 --> 00:29:22,252
- You.
- Go.

570
00:29:22,298 --> 00:29:24,206
- What you mean, "go"?
- Because it was your idea.

571
00:29:24,253 --> 00:29:27,067
No. No. No. No. It's my information.

572
00:29:27,113 --> 00:29:29,718
It's nate's idea to do this nastiness.

573
00:29:31,578 --> 00:29:33,446
Rock-Paper-Scissors?

574
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:41,300
Well, i'll be damned. How you do that?

575
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:42,370
You got a tell.

576
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:44,626
I have a tell in
rock-Paper-Scissors?

577
00:29:44,672 --> 00:29:46,646
Yeah, go.

578
00:29:50,604 --> 00:29:53,813
Okay. I'm sorry.

579
00:29:55,697 --> 00:29:59,180
You're gonna go all the
way through the head.

580
00:29:59,212 --> 00:30:00,979
Damn.

581
00:30:01,013 --> 00:30:02,278
That's my bad.

582
00:30:09,047 --> 00:30:11,279
Wow. You can tell.

583
00:30:11,302 --> 00:30:13,186
Those dead
eyes --

584
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:14,954
As if there's no soul.

585
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,258
She's terminal, all right.

586
00:30:35,444 --> 00:30:37,328
That's massive.

587
00:30:37,374 --> 00:30:38,932
So, how long?

588
00:30:38,979 --> 00:30:41,491
My guess? Not long.

589
00:30:41,537 --> 00:30:43,345
Frankly, i'm surprised
she's still alive.

590
00:30:45,212 --> 00:30:47,724
Almost too big to believe.

591
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:51,631
Fine. She's gonna die.
You still don't know when.

592
00:30:51,678 --> 00:30:53,724
I mean, you heard the doc.
She could kick at any time.

593
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:55,422
Who knows how long
these saps will hang on?

594
00:30:55,468 --> 00:30:58,400
Could i have a little
word with you in private?

595
00:30:58,446 --> 00:31:00,609
Yeah? Yeah?

596
00:31:04,772 --> 00:31:06,958
You know, it's normal to be a
little bit nervous, you know?

597
00:31:06,981 --> 00:31:08,283
But you go to have faith.

598
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,772
He has a lot of experience with this.

599
00:31:10,818 --> 00:31:13,052
It just feels like
there's a lot of risk here,

600
00:31:13,098 --> 00:31:14,866
And i don't know if that measures out...

601
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:16,424
???

602
00:31:16,446 --> 00:31:18,215
Yeah?

603
00:31:18,331 --> 00:31:19,936
When?

604
00:31:21,517 --> 00:31:22,796
Chicago.

605
00:31:22,843 --> 00:31:24,610
Chicago, right?

606
00:31:24,657 --> 00:31:27,448
Oh, wow. Well, no. That's great.

607
00:31:28,216 --> 00:31:30,046
The big one.

608
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,472
Yeah. Great.

609
00:31:33,518 --> 00:31:34,751
Thank you.

610
00:31:34,797 --> 00:31:38,495
Well, mother of three in chicago
won't be finishing her bucket list.

611
00:31:38,541 --> 00:31:41,054
Perfect timing. I've
been eyeing this lexus.

612
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,345
What is he doing?

613
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,822
- So, where's my cut?
- Your what?

614
00:31:47,868 --> 00:31:50,240
I gave you 10 grand. I want my take.

615
00:31:50,287 --> 00:31:52,752
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

616
00:31:52,845 --> 00:31:55,171
No, that was a holding
fee. You're not in.

617
00:31:55,218 --> 00:31:58,312
The hell i'm not. I want my money.

618
00:32:00,055 --> 00:32:03,113
Well, okay.

619
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:06,381
First-Stage investor.

620
00:32:06,404 --> 00:32:07,381
Very good.

621
00:32:07,428 --> 00:32:09,149
Payout bonus kind of thing.

622
00:32:09,196 --> 00:32:10,731
$100,000?

623
00:32:10,777 --> 00:32:13,546
What is he doing?!

624
00:32:16,382 --> 00:32:17,684
Sup?

625
00:32:17,731 --> 00:32:20,614
There you
go -- 100 g.

626
00:32:24,406 --> 00:32:26,964
I think this just might
work out after all.

627
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:30,569
With this money, you know,
you can start your own company,

628
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,499
Just leave your father for good, hey?

629
00:32:33,546 --> 00:32:35,454
Yeah, i just have to move
some accounts around --

630
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,640
Whoa! Whoa! Move some what around?

631
00:32:37,686 --> 00:32:38,896
I'm sorry. What did you just say?

632
00:32:38,942 --> 00:32:40,756
Move some accounts around?
Who do you think we are?

633
00:32:40,803 --> 00:32:43,500
We don't operate this way.
I can't do business like --

634
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:44,524
Who did you bring me to?

635
00:32:44,525 --> 00:32:45,757
- ??
- What is this?

636
00:32:45,804 --> 00:32:48,269
- I don't understand. No.
- I just need to move some accounts around.

637
00:32:48,315 --> 00:32:49,827
I can't help you if you don't get it.

638
00:32:49,873 --> 00:32:51,478
We don't need you.

639
00:32:51,525 --> 00:32:52,966
Keep the m--
It's fine.

640
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,594
Okay. Okay. Okay, no,
no. Don't worry about it.

641
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,385
Let's get some serious investors.

642
00:32:57,432 --> 00:32:59,478
I'll be able to talk him around.

643
00:32:59,525 --> 00:33:00,664
Um, excuse me.

644
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:03,409
Nate, can i have a word?

645
00:33:08,177 --> 00:33:10,386
I'll stop payment on the check.
Just give me a few seconds.

646
00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:12,084
Just let it go, will you?

647
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,061
Now, let me get something straight.

648
00:33:14,107 --> 00:33:16,271
We had half a million for our clients,

649
00:33:16,317 --> 00:33:17,969
And we didn't take it.

650
00:33:18,015 --> 00:33:21,038
Now we've given the mark 100 grand

651
00:33:21,085 --> 00:33:22,969
Of our money
--My money.

652
00:33:23,015 --> 00:33:24,248
Basics stall.

653
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,015
Stall is for when you've
got someone on the hook.

654
00:33:26,062 --> 00:33:27,806
What about papa bear, okay?

655
00:33:27,852 --> 00:33:30,528
Dennis can't take a leak
without henry signing off for it.

656
00:33:30,574 --> 00:33:32,179
How's he supposed to get us that money?

657
00:33:32,225 --> 00:33:33,970
Guys, you got to trust me, all right?

658
00:33:34,016 --> 00:33:36,016
You've trusted me before,
and with your life.

659
00:33:36,063 --> 00:33:37,342
Not when you're drunk.

660
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,923
Oh, come on.

661
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,412
You're not in control of yourself.

662
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:43,512
So, what, you're gonna
control me? Is that it?

663
00:33:43,574 --> 00:33:44,994
Ah, i ain't your daddy.

664
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,413
You can drink yourself into a
coma as far as i'm concerned,

665
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,040
But you take me down with
you -- Then it's my problem.

666
00:33:50,087 --> 00:33:53,087
You know, you talk too much. You
ought to just go skip some rope.

667
00:33:53,134 --> 00:33:54,785
- What? What?
- ???

668
00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:57,460
You want me to skip something? I'll skip
your drunk ass off this marble floor.

669
00:33:57,507 --> 00:34:00,065
Okay, i need to speak to nate alone.

670
00:34:06,786 --> 00:34:09,080
For a second.

671
00:34:16,066 --> 00:34:19,275
Now, don't you dare give me
the "we're all a family" speech.

672
00:34:20,578 --> 00:34:22,229
Mnh-Mnh. No speeches.

673
00:34:22,275 --> 00:34:24,019
Just a question.

674
00:34:26,346 --> 00:34:28,765
Is this helping you? Hmm?

675
00:34:29,532 --> 00:34:32,788
If you give wayne
scott back what he lost,

676
00:34:33,044 --> 00:34:34,979
Will you be satisfied?

677
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:37,648
You know me. I can do this.

678
00:34:37,695 --> 00:34:40,022
I knew you two years ago.

679
00:34:40,068 --> 00:34:42,347
Well, i'm still the same person.

680
00:34:42,394 --> 00:34:46,379
No. You're not.

681
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,646
No, i'm not.

682
00:35:14,419 --> 00:35:15,768
???

683
00:35:15,798 --> 00:35:18,211
- I'm in.
- You're too late. You missed the deadline.

684
00:35:18,257 --> 00:35:19,350
What deadline?

685
00:35:19,397 --> 00:35:20,676
My deadline.

686
00:35:20,722 --> 00:35:22,565
Yeah, we're closed for business.

687
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:24,397
$5 million.

688
00:35:24,653 --> 00:35:26,798
Does that open any doors?

689
00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:28,513
Uh, how soon?

690
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,746
Meet me at the first sunshine bank.

691
00:35:31,365 --> 00:35:32,792
Damn it! You are right.

692
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,189
I told you.

693
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:38,700
He is trying to transfer $5
million from the corporate account.

694
00:35:39,499 --> 00:35:41,886
I can't believe he would do this
after all i have done for him.

695
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:44,561
- What are you gonna do?
- Oh, well, he wants to move the money, right?

696
00:35:44,607 --> 00:35:47,532
Let's move it someplace
he can't get at it.

697
00:35:49,841 --> 00:35:51,585
Get everyone in position.

698
00:35:54,565 --> 00:35:56,259
On my way.

699
00:36:00,073 --> 00:36:02,656
We're still at the retzings' bank.

700
00:36:03,749 --> 00:36:05,332
We have an issue.

701
00:36:08,098 --> 00:36:10,516
That takes care of your end.

702
00:36:10,563 --> 00:36:13,298
Pam will just print out
the rest for you to sign.

703
00:36:15,238 --> 00:36:17,285
I'll just be a minute.

704
00:36:26,029 --> 00:36:28,076
These are for randy.

705
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:29,402
Mr. Retzing,

706
00:36:29,449 --> 00:36:31,332
I think someone smashed
the window of your hummer.

707
00:36:31,379 --> 00:36:35,077
Damn it. You deal with the rest of this.

708
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:43,450
Do you have any idea how
much those windshields cost?

709
00:36:44,845 --> 00:36:45,798
What are you doing here?

710
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:49,264
Oh, you always thought you
were smarter than us, better.

711
00:36:49,298 --> 00:36:51,589
I don't know what randy
has told you, but --

712
00:36:51,636 --> 00:36:54,698
Yeah, excuse me. Mr.
Retzing, how do you...

713
00:36:55,147 --> 00:36:57,916
if i may, we have a very
unique investment opportunity.

714
00:36:57,962 --> 00:36:59,567
Oh, shut up!

715
00:36:59,614 --> 00:37:02,521
You -- You are no longer
an officer in my company.

716
00:37:02,544 --> 00:37:05,965
I have transferred all of
my signatory power to randy.

717
00:37:05,998 --> 00:37:06,869
What?

718
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:10,150
Your son and i, we have
a -- We have a deal.

719
00:37:10,196 --> 00:37:12,591
Oh, what? Did he promise you money?

720
00:37:12,615 --> 00:37:14,931
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, well, he doesn't have any.

721
00:37:14,965 --> 00:37:17,998
I transferred all the funds offshore.

722
00:37:18,033 --> 00:37:19,824
You can't even touch it.

723
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,870
You did what?

724
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:23,383
Do you realize what you've done?

725
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,081
Yeah, he's standing
by his family --

726
00:37:25,127 --> 00:37:27,848
The only family that matters.

727
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:29,592
Family? Yeah.

728
00:37:29,616 --> 00:37:30,732
Family? Yeah.

729
00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:33,453
- Don't you dare
- Talk about family. Yeah, well, truth's a bitch.

730
00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:35,408
Do you know what i've
done for this family?

731
00:37:35,431 --> 00:37:38,265
I am this family!

732
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:42,896
Everybody out now.

733
00:37:51,362 --> 00:37:52,998
Yeah?

734
00:37:53,031 --> 00:37:55,013
Wait. No, slow down. Slow down.

735
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,362
No, you're not making any sense.

736
00:37:58,532 --> 00:37:59,664
Yeah.

737
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:00,998
What?

738
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:03,265
Well, what do you
mean our check bounced?

739
00:38:03,298 --> 00:38:05,232
Well, you tell me.
You're the accountant.

740
00:38:05,265 --> 00:38:07,758
No. No. No. Fax it on over here.
There's got to be some mistake.

741
00:38:07,805 --> 00:38:09,154
What the hell?

742
00:38:09,177 --> 00:38:11,165
All right. I'll call you back.

743
00:38:12,782 --> 00:38:14,317
What did you do?

744
00:38:14,363 --> 00:38:15,764
What?

745
00:38:15,798 --> 00:38:17,154
Did you sign something?

746
00:38:17,177 --> 00:38:18,898
Yeah, the winter edge games deal.

747
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:20,690
I can write all the checks i want now.

748
00:38:20,736 --> 00:38:22,062
Look, screw the games.

749
00:38:22,108 --> 00:38:24,992
You signed away controlling
interest in the company.

750
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:26,225
What? No, i didn't.

751
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:28,039
No, there's got to be some mistake.

752
00:38:28,085 --> 00:38:29,178
No. No. We will fix it.

753
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:31,900
All i did was sign the deal with leena.

754
00:38:31,947 --> 00:38:34,644
It was a $500,000 investment.

755
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,272
- Is this what you signed?
- Yeah, i think so.

756
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:39,016
That takes care of your end.

757
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:41,465
Pam will just print out
the rest for you to sign.

758
00:38:51,994 --> 00:38:54,250
These are for randy.

759
00:38:54,273 --> 00:38:56,698
Mr. Retzing, i think someone
smashed the window of your hummer.

760
00:38:56,731 --> 00:38:58,763
Damn it. You deal with the rest of this.

761
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:00,460
Good. Good.

762
00:39:00,484 --> 00:39:02,879
Now that the transfer
of authority is done,

763
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:06,232
We can just go ahead and
close our little deal, huh?

764
00:39:06,265 --> 00:39:09,065
This isn't $500,000.

765
00:39:09,088 --> 00:39:12,698
You transferred 51% of our
corporate powers to her group.

766
00:39:12,731 --> 00:39:13,931
What?

767
00:39:17,415 --> 00:39:19,415
They set us up.

768
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,578
They wanted you to find
out what i was up to

769
00:39:21,624 --> 00:39:23,299
So that you would
transfer power to randy.

770
00:39:23,345 --> 00:39:26,345
And then once you did,
this idiot did the rest.

771
00:39:26,392 --> 00:39:28,230
What does this mean
-- That we're broke?

772
00:39:28,277 --> 00:39:30,579
No. No. No. No. This is just temporary.

773
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:32,931
We will get the company back.

774
00:39:39,021 --> 00:39:41,232
Henry retzing, you're under arrest.

775
00:39:41,265 --> 00:39:42,115
What?

776
00:39:42,161 --> 00:39:45,859
Five hours ago, the s.E.C. Filed
a suspicious-Activities report

777
00:39:45,906 --> 00:39:48,115
After a large, undeclared
transfer of money

778
00:39:48,161 --> 00:39:49,301
Triggered a security alert.

779
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:51,347
What securities? I didn't
transfer any securities.

780
00:39:51,394 --> 00:39:53,022
Well, he wants to move the money, right?

781
00:39:53,068 --> 00:39:55,232
Let's move it someplace
he can't get at it.

782
00:39:55,265 --> 00:39:58,069
Combined with your
previous fraudulent actions,

783
00:39:58,116 --> 00:40:02,674
You're being charged with engaging in a pattern
of corrupt activity under the state rico act.

784
00:40:02,953 --> 00:40:04,865
You have the right to remain silent.

785
00:40:04,898 --> 00:40:08,070
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

786
00:40:08,094 --> 00:40:10,559
You have the right to have an
attorney with you during questioning.

787
00:40:10,605 --> 00:40:13,536
How could you have known he
was gonna make that transfer?

788
00:40:13,582 --> 00:40:15,629
You wouldn't be talking
to me if you had anything.

789
00:40:15,675 --> 00:40:17,396
You're fishing.

790
00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:19,047
I'll tell you what.

791
00:40:19,094 --> 00:40:21,792
Why don't you give me two days
to get them to cross the line?

792
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,931
One minor transgression, you got him.

793
00:40:23,965 --> 00:40:26,165
We'll move out of the
way. You get retzing.

794
00:40:26,746 --> 00:40:28,490
Do you understand the
rights i've just read to you?

795
00:40:28,537 --> 00:40:30,746
No, i-I had to move the
money. You don't understand.

796
00:40:30,792 --> 00:40:31,955
I just had to. I had to.

797
00:40:32,002 --> 00:40:34,887
Just shut up. Don't say anything else.

798
00:40:38,398 --> 00:40:39,831
Hello?

799
00:40:39,865 --> 00:40:41,831
Did you even look at the names?

800
00:40:41,865 --> 00:40:42,794
What?

801
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,538
The names on the list.

802
00:40:45,584 --> 00:40:47,491
A short list right here.

803
00:40:47,538 --> 00:40:49,655
Yeah, those would be
the names of the families

804
00:40:49,678 --> 00:40:51,981
That lost their
homes to you --

805
00:40:52,004 --> 00:40:53,260
Your victims.

806
00:40:53,306 --> 00:40:55,198
How big is your operation?

807
00:40:55,232 --> 00:40:57,422
400 homes, give or take.

808
00:40:57,446 --> 00:40:58,499
You son
of a --

809
00:40:58,532 --> 00:41:00,609
Now that we control the company, though,

810
00:41:00,664 --> 00:41:04,098
We're gonna make sure the rightful
owners get back into those homes.

811
00:41:04,447 --> 00:41:06,831
You know this will
never hold up in court.

812
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:08,679
Randy's incompetent.

813
00:41:08,726 --> 00:41:11,165
I got to say, you're
pretty good with the books,

814
00:41:11,198 --> 00:41:14,065
Declaring your own family's
home a corporate asset.

815
00:41:14,098 --> 00:41:16,261
Some nice tax breaks there.

816
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,634
Of course, now that we
control the corporation,

817
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,365
We're gonna have to reclaim that
particular piece of property.

818
00:41:23,006 --> 00:41:26,239
Take your time moving
out -- Two, three days.

819
00:41:26,425 --> 00:41:28,898
Leave the keys under the mat.

820
00:41:35,891 --> 00:41:38,240
Yeah, it's a little bigger
than the other place,

821
00:41:38,286 --> 00:41:40,170
But...

822
00:41:40,868 --> 00:41:43,165
i hope it'll do.

823
00:41:49,566 --> 00:41:51,124
Are you crying?

824
00:41:51,171 --> 00:41:53,776
Sup? No. No. It's the florida air.

825
00:41:53,822 --> 00:41:55,298
Pollen.

826
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,451
The house was a nice touch.

827
00:41:59,498 --> 00:42:01,532
Symbolic thing.

828
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:04,172
You never used to go in for theatrics.

829
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:07,664
Well, like you said, i've changed.

830
00:42:07,698 --> 00:42:09,614
You're still a mess.

831
00:42:10,846 --> 00:42:14,031
You know, one of these days, they
may not stick around and back you up.

832
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:16,545
- They?
- Yes, they.

833
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:19,848
And me.

834
00:42:20,592 --> 00:42:23,565
Are you threatening
to bail on me, sophie?

835
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:26,081
Give me a reason to stay.

836
