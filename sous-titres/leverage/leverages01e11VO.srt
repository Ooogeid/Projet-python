2
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:07,187
COME TO BED.

3
00:00:07,222 --> 00:00:09,541
IT'S 4:00 A.M., AND YOU HAVE TO
BE AT WORK IN THREE HOURS.

4
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:10,713
I KNOW.
I'M ALMOST FINISHED.

5
00:00:10,748 --> 00:00:12,628
YOU SAID THAT
TWO HOURS AGO.

6
00:00:12,915 --> 00:00:14,394
FIVE MORE MINUTES.

7
00:00:14,674 --> 00:00:16,178
I'M COUNTING.

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,632
ENOUGH STUDYING.

9
00:00:36,517 --> 00:00:37,537
GLORIA.

10
00:00:37,572 --> 00:00:38,975
GLORIA!

11
00:00:41,756 --> 00:00:42,531
ERNESTO.

12
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:43,359
ERNESTO!

13
00:00:43,394 --> 00:00:44,433
NO!

14
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:46,713
NO-O!

15
00:00:47,943 --> 00:00:48,888
I DID MY JOB.

16
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,486
YOU TOLD ME TO GET US
INTO THE PENTHOUSE.

17
00:00:50,486 --> 00:00:52,673
YEAH, BY FOLLOWING
MY PLAN, PARKER.

18
00:00:52,708 --> 00:00:54,021
-WHAT?
-BY GETTING US ALL IN SAFELY.

19
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:55,347
DID THE ELEVATOR DECAPITATE YOU?

20
00:00:55,382 --> 00:00:56,978
DID IT DECAPITATE YOU?

21
00:00:57,354 --> 00:00:58,578
ACTUALLY, FROM THIS ANGLE,

22
00:00:58,613 --> 00:01:00,028
IT LOOKS PRETTY CLOSE ON
THE DECAPITATION.

23
00:01:00,028 --> 00:01:00,781
A4.

24
00:01:01,236 --> 00:01:02,218
YOU NEED TO
GO TALK TO HER.

25
00:01:02,253 --> 00:01:03,785
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME
SHE'S GONE LOCO.

26
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,173
-PARKER?
-I'M SERIOUS.

27
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:07,183
PARKER, I THINK
WHAT EVERYONE'S FEELING

28
00:01:07,218 --> 00:01:09,417
IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO TAKE
INSANE RISKS ON YOUR OWN TIME,

29
00:01:09,452 --> 00:01:11,006
THEN GO AHEAD,
BUT WHEN WE'RE ON A JOB,

30
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,784
YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER
THE REST OF US.

31
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:14,498
-EXCUSE ME.
-THIS ISN'T FOR ME.

32
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,690
IT'S ADDRESSED TO SOMEBODY
NAMED ALICE WHITE.

33
00:01:16,725 --> 00:01:18,054
YOUA REALICE WHITE.

34
00:01:18,089 --> 00:01:20,213
IT'S ONE OF THE ALIASES
I MADE FOR YOU --

35
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:22,029
VEGETARIAN, BOOKKEEPER.

36
00:01:22,064 --> 00:01:24,940
SHE HAD A PRETTY WILD TIME AT
HER SISTER'S WEDDING IN PHOENIX.

37
00:01:24,975 --> 00:01:26,667
YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT
HER FACEBOOK PAGE.

38
00:01:26,702 --> 00:01:28,739
ALICE WHITE
HAS JURY DUTY.

39
00:01:28,774 --> 00:01:29,765
DAMN, I AM GOOD.

40
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,647
YEAH,
CONGRATULATIONS.

41
00:01:30,682 --> 00:01:32,639
ALICE THANKS YOU
FOR GETTING HER OUT OF IT.

42
00:01:34,338 --> 00:01:36,246
NO. NO.

43
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:39,738
JURY DUTY -- A PLACE WHERE
YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS.

44
00:01:39,773 --> 00:01:43,310
WHERE YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER
OTHER PEOPLE'S POINT OF VIEW.

45
00:01:43,345 --> 00:01:46,825
-THERE'S GONNA BE
NORMAL PEOPLE THERE, NATE.
-NO, NO, NO.

46
00:01:47,152 --> 00:01:49,087
YOU'RE NOT GETTING OUT OF THIS.

47
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:51,990
ALICE WHITE IS REPORTING
FOR JURY DUTY.

<font color="#ffff00">Capture: ив╬х
Sync:VinE</font>

50
00:02:02,696 --> 00:02:05,211
ERNESTO VARGAS WAS A HUSBAND,

51
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:06,490
A FATHER OF TWO DAUGHTERS,

52
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:07,833
A WAREHOUSE MANAGER,

53
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:09,624
AND HE WENT
TO NIGHT SCHOOL.

54
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:11,295
HE NEEDED MORE ENERGY.

55
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,759
SO HE BOUGHT THIS.

56
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:17,904
FastLife.

57
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:21,702
IT'S AN "ALL-NATURAL
ENERGY SUPPLEMENT"

58
00:02:21,737 --> 00:02:24,741
THAT WAS PRODUCED BY THAT MAN,

59
00:02:24,776 --> 00:02:26,075
WILLIAM QUINT.

60
00:02:26,732 --> 00:02:30,702
WE'LL SHOW THAT FastLife CAUSED
ERNESTO VARGAS' FATAL HEART ATTACK,

61
00:02:30,737 --> 00:02:33,992
AND THAT MR. QUINT KNEW THE
DANGERS THAT HIS PRODUCT POSED

62
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:35,536
WHEN HE PUT IT ON THE MARKET.

63
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:38,629
ALL ERNESTO WANTED
WAS MORE TIME.

64
00:02:40,101 --> 00:02:42,309
AND THAT'S THE ONLY THING
WE CAN'T GIVE HIM.

65
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,643
I HOPE THE REST OF THIS CASE
IS THIS GOOD.

66
00:02:47,678 --> 00:02:49,471
WHAT'D YOU HAVE FOR BREAKFAST?

67
00:02:49,506 --> 00:02:51,039
YOU SMELL LIKE GRAVY.

68
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,051
Order.

69
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:57,418
MR. LOUIS, ARE YOU READY TO MAKE
YOUR OPENING STATEMENT?

70
00:02:57,453 --> 00:02:58,586
YES, YOUR HONOR.

71
00:03:01,324 --> 00:03:02,696
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

72
00:03:06,944 --> 00:03:09,348
DO IT JUST LIKE
WE REHEARSED, HENRY.

73
00:03:09,383 --> 00:03:11,784
IT'S BEEN TAILOR-MADE
FOR THIS JURY.

74
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:16,409
We all want to believe that future
tragedies can be prevented

75
00:03:16,444 --> 00:03:19,068
IF WE HOLD SOMEONE,
ANYONE ACCOUNTABLE.

76
00:03:19,103 --> 00:03:20,164
Maintain eye contact.

77
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,684
YOU'RE LOSING
JUROR NUMBER 4.

78
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:24,384
BUT COMMON SENSE
WILL TELL YOU

79
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:26,951
THAT NOT ALL TRAGEDIES
CAN BE PREVENTED.

80
00:03:27,385 --> 00:03:29,409
AND WHEN YOU RUSH
TO JUDGMENT...

81
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:32,413
lives are ruined,

82
00:03:32,448 --> 00:03:36,311
and an honest businessman can
have his life's work destroyed.

83
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:37,559
WHO IS SHE?

84
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:38,822
WHAT IS SHE LOOKING AT?

85
00:03:38,857 --> 00:03:40,152
ALICE WHITE --
BOOKKEEPER.

86
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:43,493
SHE'S BEEN ZONING IN AND OUT
ALL MORNING. COULD BE CONFUSED.

87
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:47,651
NOTHING'S MORE DANGEROUS
THAN THE CONFUSED

88
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,780
WHEN THEY THINK
THEY KNOW SOMETHING.

89
00:03:51,342 --> 00:03:56,359
SO, MY VIDEO WALL PLUS DIRECTV
NFL SUNDAY TICKET IN HD.

90
00:03:56,394 --> 00:03:57,542
-INCREDIBLE.
-WHAT DO YOU THINK?

91
00:03:57,542 --> 00:03:58,614
-GREAT.
-RIGHT.

92
00:03:58,649 --> 00:03:59,328
-YEAH.
-RIGHT?

93
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:00,399
I THINK IT'S FUNNY.

94
00:04:00,434 --> 00:04:02,081
YOU KNOW, IT REMINDS ME
A BIT OF RUGBY,

95
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,116
EXCEPT -- WELL, YOU AMERICANS,

96
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:06,055
YOU WEAR THE HELMETS
AND THE PADS AND EVERYTHING

97
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,477
SO YOU DON'T GET HURT.

98
00:04:07,512 --> 00:04:09,161
-OH, YOU DIDN'T.
-WHAT?

99
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:12,455
PARKER, HOW IS
JUROR NUMBER 6 TODAY?

100
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,963
-GOOD. OKAY, HERE IT IS.
-FUMBLE!

101
00:04:13,998 --> 00:04:16,114
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING DIRTY
GOING ON WITH THIS TRIAL

102
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,172
AND THE WOMAN WHO LOST HER HUSBAND'S
GONNA GET HURT EVEN WORSE,

103
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:20,546
AND THAT WE SHOULD, UM,
YOU KNOW, GET INVOLVED.

104
00:04:20,581 --> 00:04:22,242
INVOLVED?
WHAT -- WHAT DO YOU --

105
00:04:22,277 --> 00:04:23,669
NO, NO, NO. NO, NO, NO.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

106
00:04:23,704 --> 00:04:24,820
THEY HAD HIDDEN CAMERAS,

107
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:27,315
AND THE LAWYERS HAD COMMS
LIKE OUR COMMS.

108
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,325
FIRST, MOVE.

109
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,237
SECOND,

110
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:31,551
NOBODY HAS OUR COMMS.

111
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:33,744
PARKER, LISTEN, THERE IS NOT
SOME EVIL CONSPIRACY

112
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:36,356
LURKING BEHIND THE CURTAIN
OF EVERY ROUTINE CIVIC ACTIVITY.

113
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:38,550
I MAKE OUR COMMS.
ME. I MAKE 'EM.

114
00:04:38,585 --> 00:04:40,016
AIN'T NOBODY
GOT OUR COMMS.

115
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,126
NOW, WHAT'S HAPPENING IS,
YOU'RE ON A BORING JURY TRIAL.

116
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:46,902
OKAY?
NOW, COULD YOU...

117
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,198
PARKER! JUST...

118
00:04:54,179 --> 00:04:55,651
YOU KNOW,
SHE'S NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE.

119
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:57,507
WHAT, STORMED OUT?
COME ON.

120
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:58,530
NO.

121
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,178
ASKED FOR OUR HELP.

122
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:10,805
WHAT?

123
00:05:13,489 --> 00:05:17,508
LISTEN, THERE IS A REASON
WE PUT HER IN A JURY TRIAL.

124
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:24,273
YOU KNOW, MAN, WHEN I WAS A --

125
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:26,520
WHEN I WAS A KID,
I WAS LIKE 8 YEARS OLD,

126
00:05:26,555 --> 00:05:28,959
I HAD A FOSTER MOM
WHO WAS JEHOVAH'S WITNESS.

127
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:30,969
SHE USED TO DRESS ME UP
IN A SUIT AND A BOW TIE

128
00:05:31,004 --> 00:05:32,833
AND TAKE ME DOOR-TO-DOOR
TO SPREAD THE WORD.

129
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:35,247
BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS, WHITE
NEIGHBORHOODS -- DIDN'T MATTER.

130
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:37,206
I WOULD KICK,
I'D SCREAM, OR WHATEVER,

131
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:38,038
BUT SHE WOULD SAY

132
00:05:38,073 --> 00:05:41,269
"ALEC, YOU NEED TO LEARN
HOW TO TALK TO PEOPLE."

133
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:43,853
SEE, EVERYTHING I LEARNED
ABOUT PEOPLE,

134
00:05:43,888 --> 00:05:46,627
I LEARNED RINGING DOORBELLS
AND -- AND --

135
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:47,851
AND BEING IN A BOW TIE.

136
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,658
PARKER NEVER HAD THAT.

137
00:05:49,693 --> 00:05:52,332
I MEAN, JUMPING FROM
A SKYSCRAPER, SHE'S COOL.

138
00:05:52,367 --> 00:05:54,293
BUT MAKING SMALL TALK?

139
00:05:54,328 --> 00:05:56,267
THAT'S -- IT'S LIKE PURE TERROR.

140
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:57,723
JUST CUT HER
SOME SLACK.

141
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,741
HOW ABOUT THEM COWBOYS?

142
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,294
WHAT'D I MISS?

143
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:03,382
NOTHING.

144
00:06:06,136 --> 00:06:07,525
ALL RIGHT. UH, ELIOT,

145
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,479
GONNA NEED YOU TO GO WITH PARKER
TO CHECK SOMETHING OUT.

146
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:10,278
ALL RIGHT.

147
00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:11,702
-YEAH.
-NOW.

148
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:15,389
-RIGHT NOW?
-YEAH, RIGHT NOW. YEAH.

149
00:06:15,424 --> 00:06:16,236
-LIKE, NOW?
-YEAH.

150
00:06:17,048 --> 00:06:19,148
JUST GO GET PARKER.

151
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:22,650
THANKS FOR THE BEER.

152
00:06:22,685 --> 00:06:24,589
Tell you what,
THIS IS NOT HAPPENIN', BUBBA.

153
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:26,364
YOU AIN'T TAKIN' MY BEER.

154
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:39,066
I'M OUTSIDE.

155
00:07:04,346 --> 00:07:05,389
YOU'RE LATE.

156
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:10,151
HEY, I JUST SPENT EIGHT HOURS
SITTING IN A PLASTIC CHAIR

157
00:07:10,186 --> 00:07:12,678
WHILE SOME AMBULANCE CHASER
CALLED ME A KILLER.

158
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:13,929
I PAID FOR THAT CHAIR.

159
00:07:13,964 --> 00:07:17,375
YOU DON'T LIKE IT, GO HOME
AND SUCK BACK SOME INCENSE.

160
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:21,127
ALWAYS A PLEASURE,
MS. EARNSHAW.

161
00:07:21,162 --> 00:07:22,665
WHO'S EARNSHAW?

162
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:25,278
HARDISON?

163
00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:26,269
I'm on it.

164
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:35,042
THINK MAYBE I SHOULD SETTLE
THIS CASE AND BE DONE WITH IT.

165
00:07:35,077 --> 00:07:36,330
IT'S NOT
UP TO YOU ANYMORE.

166
00:07:36,745 --> 00:07:38,081
YOU WANT TO BUY MY COMPANY,

167
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:38,947
BUY IT.

168
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:40,612
YOU DON'T, DON'T.

169
00:07:40,647 --> 00:07:42,658
BUT IT'S MY TOCHES
THAT'S ON THE LINE HERE --

170
00:07:42,693 --> 00:07:44,433
THE ONLY THING
YOU HAVE ON THE LINE

171
00:07:44,468 --> 00:07:46,578
IS YOUR PENNY-ANTE
GRANOLA COMPANY.

172
00:07:46,613 --> 00:07:48,057
I COULD LOSE EVERYTHING.

173
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,516
WINNING IS THE ONLY OPTION.

174
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:52,548
YOU GO BEHIND MY BACK

175
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,171
AND TRY TO SETTLE THIS CASE,

176
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:56,852
I WILL BURY YOU.

177
00:07:57,457 --> 00:07:58,644
ARE WE CLEAR?

178
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,834
THAT KIND OF JURY PROFILING
COSTS A FORTUNE.

179
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:08,363
TRIAL, THEY SAID
QUINT'S COMPANY WAS TINY.

180
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:11,363
NOW WE SEE...

181
00:08:11,398 --> 00:08:13,067
WHAT THEY SEE.

182
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:16,210
DAMN.

183
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,202
THEY HACKED
THE COURTROOM'S SECURITY FEED

184
00:08:18,237 --> 00:08:20,017
AND PLANTED
THEIR OWN CAMERAS.

185
00:08:20,052 --> 00:08:21,609
THAT'S WHAT
I WOULD'VE DONE.

186
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:23,328
THEY GOT THERE FIRST.

187
00:08:36,746 --> 00:08:38,324
ALL RIGHT.
WE HAVE A NEW CLIENT.

188
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:40,879
APPARENTLY, THERE IS
AN EVIL CONSPIRACY LURKING

189
00:08:40,914 --> 00:08:43,271
BEHIND THE CURTAIN
OF EVERY ROUTINE

190
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:45,702
ET CETERA, ET CETERA,
ET CETERA.

191
00:08:45,737 --> 00:08:47,965
GLORIA VARGAS
IS SUING WILLIAM QUINT

192
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,300
OVER THE WRONGFUL DEATH
OF HER HUSBAND.

193
00:08:50,335 --> 00:08:52,204
NOW, IT SHOULD BE A SIMPLE,

194
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:53,847
LOW-STAKES WRONGFUL DEATH SUIT.

195
00:08:53,882 --> 00:08:55,486
BUT QUINT HAS HELP.

196
00:08:55,521 --> 00:08:56,589
TOBEY EARNSHAW,

197
00:08:56,624 --> 00:08:58,325
OF EARNSHAW PHARMACEUTICALS.

198
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,604
FATHER FOUNDED THE COMPANY,
AND HE'S STILL C.E.O.

199
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,087
WHY DOES A DRUG HEIRESS
CARE ABOUT  A LAWSUIT

200
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:05,016
AGAINST A TINY
SUPPLEMENTS COMPANY?

201
00:09:05,051 --> 00:09:07,513
'CAUSE WITHOUT TELLING DADDY
OR THE EXECUTIVE BOARD,

202
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:10,435
EARNSHAW SANK $20 MILLION
INTO R&D FOR FastLife

203
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,078
IN ANTICIPATION
OF BUYING THE COMPANY.

204
00:09:12,113 --> 00:09:14,397
SEE, LIVE HERBALLY
LOSES THIS TRIAL,

205
00:09:14,432 --> 00:09:16,920
THEN THOUSANDS OF OTHER
LAWSUITS JUST LIKE IT

206
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:17,918
WILL FALL OUT OF THE SKY.

207
00:09:17,953 --> 00:09:19,565
THE BUYOUT FALLS THROUGH.

208
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,895
YEAH, AND EARNSHAW'S
OUT ON HER ASS.

209
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,278
TO PROTECT AN INVESTMENT
SHE KNOWS KILLS PEOPLE,

210
00:09:25,822 --> 00:09:28,981
EARNSHAW IS GOING TO DESTROY
THIS YOUNG WIDOW.

211
00:09:29,016 --> 00:09:32,171
WELL, THEN, WE HAVE TO WIN
THE COURT CASE FOR GLORIA.

212
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:33,211
WE CAN'T.

213
00:09:35,984 --> 00:09:38,282
NO, GUYS, WE GOT INTO THIS
WAY TOO LATE.

214
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:39,861
I MEAN,
THE BEST WE CAN HOPE FOR

215
00:09:39,896 --> 00:09:42,108
IS TO CON QUINT
INTO A SETTLEMENT.

216
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,227
WAIT A MINUTE. EARNSHAW TOOK
SETTLEMENT OFF THE TABLE.

217
00:09:44,262 --> 00:09:47,162
OH. THEN, YOU KNOW, WE TRY TO
CONVINCE HIM TO PUT IT BACK ON.

218
00:09:47,197 --> 00:09:48,682
HELLO.

219
00:09:48,717 --> 00:09:51,824
EARNSHAW JUST RAN A CREDIT CHECK
ON ALICE WHITE.

220
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:53,307
WHO'S ALICE WHITE?

221
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,601
-YOU ARE!
-YOU ARE!

222
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,868
SHE'S GONNA BUY THE JURY.

223
00:09:58,709 --> 00:09:59,936
NOT IF WE...

224
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:01,487
STEAL IT FIRST.

225
00:10:14,988 --> 00:10:16,245
WHO PLAYS CHESS?

226
00:10:16,593 --> 00:10:17,676
I PLAY.

227
00:10:18,412 --> 00:10:19,706
OF COURSE YOU DO.

228
00:10:20,091 --> 00:10:22,265
A CHESS GAME HAS
THREE STAGES, RIGHT?

229
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,227
I MEAN, YOU GOT YOUR OPENING,
MIDDLE, AND END GAME.

230
00:10:24,262 --> 00:10:26,835
IN THE OPENING, YOU WANT TO
TAKE CONTROL OF THE BOARD,

231
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,802
AND YOU WANT TO
LINE UP YOUR ATTACK

232
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:29,696
AND YOU WANT TO
PROTECT THE KING,

233
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:32,791
WHICH, IRONICALLY,
IS THE WEAKEST PIECE YOU HAVE.

234
00:10:32,826 --> 00:10:34,503
YOU KNOW THIS IS A TRIAL,
RIGHT?

235
00:10:34,538 --> 00:10:38,173
EARNSHAW HAS ALREADY OVERPOWERED
THE VARGAS DEFENSE,

236
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,839
AND SHE'S BUYING A JUROR.

237
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:41,743
NOW, THAT IS A FAST,

238
00:10:41,778 --> 00:10:44,078
AGGRESSIVE OPENING GAMBIT.

239
00:10:44,113 --> 00:10:46,025
REALLY IS. SO, WE NEED TO
BREAK HER MOMENTUM HERE.

240
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,563
SO, PARKER, WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO
IS I NEED YOU TO --

241
00:10:48,598 --> 00:10:49,989
WE NEED TO STALL THE TRIAL.

242
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,542
SO, YOU'RE GOING TO GET ALL
OF THOSE JURORS TO TRUST YOU.

243
00:10:53,577 --> 00:10:55,390
UM...HOW?

244
00:10:55,425 --> 00:10:56,998
CONVERSATION. COMPLIMENTS.

245
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:59,006
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

246
00:10:59,846 --> 00:11:01,813
-OKAY.
-Okay.

247
00:11:03,634 --> 00:11:06,481
AND THIS IS EMILY.
SHE'S THE ELDEST.

248
00:11:06,516 --> 00:11:08,552
AND HER SISTER ANNE.

249
00:11:08,587 --> 00:11:09,858
AND LITTLE CHARLOTTE --

250
00:11:09,893 --> 00:11:12,270
SHE'S THE BABY OF THE FAMILY.

251
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:14,105
THAT ONE'S REALLY CUTE!

252
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,211
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THAT ONE?

253
00:11:16,246 --> 00:11:20,132
IT LOOKS LIKE A DOG
IN A BABY SUIT.

254
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,865
FIGURE OUT WHAT
HER LINE OF ATTACK IS.

255
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,795
GO DIGGING.

256
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,928
FIGURE OUT WHO HER PAWN
ON THE JURY IS.

257
00:11:29,963 --> 00:11:32,890
I'VE GOT FINANCIAL TRACES
ON ALL THE JURORS' ACCOUNTS.

258
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:35,561
AND IF IT SHOWS UP
AS CASH IN A SUITCASE?

259
00:11:36,344 --> 00:11:37,551
GO DIGGING.

260
00:11:46,135 --> 00:11:47,950
IT'S YOUR TURN
TO BE IN THE DUMPSTER.

261
00:11:47,985 --> 00:11:49,716
NO, MAN, NO. I-I HAVE --

262
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,051
I HAVE PEANUT ALLERGIES.

263
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:54,250
WHAT IF SOMEBODY THREW IN
SOME EXTRA CRUNCHY SKIPPY?

264
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:58,358
THEN, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST
A- ALL UP IN MY VOCAL AREA, MAN.

265
00:11:58,393 --> 00:11:59,612
DO YOU WANT TO GIVE ME
MOUTH-TO-MOUTH?

266
00:11:59,647 --> 00:12:02,323
NO, NONE OF US WANT THAT.
HELL NO.

267
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:08,297
HEADS UP.

268
00:12:13,346 --> 00:12:14,294
SOPHIE...

269
00:12:17,558 --> 00:12:19,463
GO AFTER HER KING.

270
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:27,595
OLIVIA SMITHE-PATEL,

271
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,178
CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER
OF MUMBAI INTERNATIONAL LIMITED.

272
00:12:31,213 --> 00:12:32,939
MUMBAI? INDIAN?

273
00:12:32,974 --> 00:12:35,549
HALF -- BRITISH FATHER,

274
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:37,172
INDIAN MOTHER.

275
00:12:38,028 --> 00:12:39,171
NAMASTE.

276
00:12:40,188 --> 00:12:41,427
I'M VERY SPIRITUAL.

277
00:12:41,871 --> 00:12:43,993
YOUR REPUTATION
PRECEDES YOU.

278
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:45,178
I HAVE A ZEN GARDEN.

279
00:12:46,888 --> 00:12:49,058
MUMBAI IS LOOKING
TO BRANCH OUT

280
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:52,763
FROM PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS
INTO THE HERBAL-SUPPLEMENT MARKET.

281
00:12:52,798 --> 00:12:56,313
WE WERE THINKING AN ACQUISITION
WOULD BE THE BEST PLAY.

282
00:12:56,348 --> 00:12:58,279
YOU WANT TO
BUY MY COMPANY?

283
00:12:58,851 --> 00:12:59,974
I'M SORRY.

284
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:01,212
I ALREADY HAVE ANOTHER OFFER.

285
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:04,180
NO, WHAT YOU HAVE
IS A JOKE.

286
00:13:04,808 --> 00:13:07,011
NOW YOU HAVE AN OFFER.

287
00:13:09,803 --> 00:13:11,282
I RETAIN STOCK OPTIONS,

288
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:13,401
CONTROL OF THE COMPANY.

289
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:15,841
-THAT'S --
-MUCH, MUCH BETTER

290
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:18,360
THAN EARNSHAW'S OFFERING YOU.

291
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:23,294
MR. QUINT, EVERY C.E.O.
OF EVERY COMPANY

292
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:28,396
THAT EARNSHAW'S BOUGHT
HAS BEEN FORCED INTO EARLY RETIREMENT.

293
00:13:28,431 --> 00:13:31,306
AS SOON AS SHE BUYS YOU OUT,
SHE KICKS YOU OUT.

294
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:35,944
WE'D PREFER TO KEEP THE MAN
THAT BUILT THIS COMPANY,

295
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,835
HONOR THE SPIRIT
THAT BUILT THIS HOUSE.

296
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:44,122
UH, HOW MUCH MONEY
ARE WE TALKING?

297
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:52,781
YOU S-- YOU SERIOUS?

298
00:13:53,344 --> 00:13:56,820
I FLEW 14,000 KILOMETERS
TO GIVE YOU THAT NUMBER.

299
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,522
IT'S A VERY LONG TRIP.

300
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,633
THAT'S A VERY LONG NUMBER.

301
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:04,011
QUINT'S ON THE HOOK --

302
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:07,133
HE WENT TO MUMBAI INTERNATIONAL LIMITED'S
WEBSITE TO CHECK OUT SOPHIE.

303
00:14:07,168 --> 00:14:07,792
IT'S A REAL COMPANY?

304
00:14:08,188 --> 00:14:09,523
COVER STORY'S BETTER
THAT WAY.

305
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:12,932
JUST, UH, CHANGED THIS...
TO THIS.

306
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:14,412
NICE.

307
00:14:14,447 --> 00:14:15,669
ANYTHING IN THE GARBAGE?

308
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:17,397
UH, JUROR NUMBER 1,

309
00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:18,669
THAT'S THE JURY FOREMAN.

310
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:20,076
THERE'S NOTHING HINKY
IN HIS FINANCES,

311
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:23,588
BUT IN HIS GARBAGE, I FOUND
AN ENVELOPE FROM PASSPORT,

312
00:14:23,623 --> 00:14:26,572
RECEIPT FOR TWO TICKETS TO FIJI,

313
00:14:26,607 --> 00:14:28,971
LUGGAGE, SOME OF THESE.

314
00:14:29,006 --> 00:14:31,641
YEAH, WRAPPERS
FOR U.S. CASH, YEAH.

315
00:14:31,676 --> 00:14:34,220
SOMEBODY CAME INTO CASH
AND JUST HAD TO COUNT IT.

316
00:14:34,255 --> 00:14:36,486
THEY'VE PAID OFF
THE JURY FOREMAN.

317
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:40,356
OKAY, TODAY DID NOT GO WELL,

318
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:41,144
BUT THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

319
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:42,449
YOU KNOW,
WE LEARN WHEN WE FAIL.

320
00:14:42,484 --> 00:14:44,225
WE'RE GONNA --
WE'RE GONNA GO BACK TO BASICS,

321
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,624
AND WE'RE GONNA DO
A LITTLE ROLE-PLAYING.

322
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:46,448
GONNA START WITH --

323
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:48,783
WITH PERSUASION TECHNIQUES.

324
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:51,670
SO, ELIOT HAS AN APPLE.

325
00:14:51,705 --> 00:14:54,895
ALICE HAS AN ORANGE.

326
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,398
I LOVE APPLES.

327
00:14:56,433 --> 00:14:59,069
APPLES ARE MY FAVORITE FRUIT.

328
00:14:59,104 --> 00:15:01,044
GOOD FOR YOU, SPARKY.

329
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:02,622
I- I DON'T HAVE TO SIT HERE

330
00:15:02,657 --> 00:15:05,237
-AND TAKE THIS CRAP.
-GO ON. JUST DO IT FOR ME.

331
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:07,165
YOU HAVE AN ORANGE,
ALL RIGHT?

332
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,948
NOW, CONVINCE ME
THAT I WANT THE ORANGE,

333
00:15:09,983 --> 00:15:11,388
NOT THE APPLE.

334
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,979
I'M GONNA TAKE A BITE.

335
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,972
I PUT A RAZOR BLADE
IN THAT APPLE.

336
00:15:22,151 --> 00:15:23,602
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

337
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:24,467
MAYBE.

338
00:15:24,502 --> 00:15:27,955
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHATDOESN'T
HAVE A RAZOR BLADE IN IT?

339
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,619
THIS ORANGE.

340
00:15:30,504 --> 00:15:32,027
DON'T YOU WANT IT?

341
00:15:34,678 --> 00:15:36,210
YOU FELL FOR THAT?

342
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:44,039
THANKS.

343
00:15:45,328 --> 00:15:46,848
THE FOREMAN'S THE PAWN?

344
00:15:47,396 --> 00:15:48,768
MAKE HIM GO AWAY,
PARKER.

345
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,550
SORRY. EXCUSE ME.

346
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,373
Help you?

347
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,138
EXCUSE ME.

348
00:16:13,734 --> 00:16:14,844
HEY, DO YOU HAVE THE TIME?

349
00:16:16,883 --> 00:16:18,658
EXCUSE ME.
HAS ANYONE SEEN MY WATCH?

350
00:16:18,693 --> 00:16:20,881
IT WAS A GIFT
FROM MY GRANDFATHER.

351
00:16:21,776 --> 00:16:23,210
MY LOCKET!

352
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:24,756
SOMEONE STOLE MY LOCKET!

353
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:27,652
-OH, MY!
-AW, GEESH!

354
00:16:31,054 --> 00:16:32,269
MY WALLET!

355
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,129
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

356
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:37,119
He stole our stuff.

357
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:41,588
I DIDN'T DO THAT!

358
00:16:42,867 --> 00:16:43,634
THANKS.

359
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,651
SORRY. EXCUSE ME.

360
00:16:49,112 --> 00:16:50,082
HELP YOU?

361
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:53,410
EXCUSE ME.

362
00:16:59,655 --> 00:17:01,432
SOMEBODY ELSE
LOSE A WATCH?

363
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:03,423
THERE YOU GO.

364
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,703
HEY, I KNOW WHO OUR
NEW FOREMAN SHOULD BE.

365
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,431
HERE'S TO THE NEW FOREMAN.

366
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:19,574
-TO ALICE.
-TO ALICE.

367
00:17:23,456 --> 00:17:24,373
Jury foreman?

368
00:17:24,408 --> 00:17:25,334
I KNOW.

369
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:26,688
YOU SAID
IT WAS IN THE BAG!

370
00:17:26,723 --> 00:17:27,681
MR. QUINT,

371
00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:29,420
I AM WHO I AM TODAY

372
00:17:29,455 --> 00:17:32,899
BECAUSE I KNOW HOW TO TURN
EVERY FAILURE INTO A SUCCESS.

373
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:34,680
I WORK EVERY ANGLE.

374
00:17:34,715 --> 00:17:38,038
I ANTICIPATE EVERY CONTINGENCY.

375
00:17:42,725 --> 00:17:44,786
-HELLO?
-Mr. Richards.

376
00:17:44,821 --> 00:17:46,715
I'D LOVE TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOME EXCITING

377
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,827
RETIREMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

378
00:17:52,323 --> 00:17:53,737
Where's the Vargas lawyer?

379
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,068
I HAVE NO IDEA. THE BAILIFF
JUST SAID HE DIDN'T SHOWED UP.

380
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,623
YOU HEARD?

381
00:17:59,114 --> 00:18:01,468
WHAT HAPPENS IF THE VARGAS'
LAWYER JUST DISAPPEARS?

382
00:18:01,503 --> 00:18:02,420
MISTRIAL.

383
00:18:02,455 --> 00:18:03,724
BUT EARNSHAW
NEED A WIN.

384
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:05,940
CLOSE ENOUGH. MISTRIAL MEANS
THEY'LL HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN.

385
00:18:05,975 --> 00:18:07,555
GLORIA VARGAS CAN'T AFFORD
ANY MORE LAWYERS.

386
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,073
SHE'LL HAVE TO
DROP THE SUIT.

387
00:18:09,108 --> 00:18:09,716
WE TAKE A PAWN.

388
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:11,259
EARNSHAW TAKES A KNIGHT.

389
00:18:11,811 --> 00:18:14,570
LUCKY FOR US,
WE HAVE MORE THAN ONE.

390
00:18:16,753 --> 00:18:18,900
ALL RISE. ??

391
00:18:18,935 --> 00:18:20,643
THE HONORABLE
JUDGE KELLY DURHAM.

392
00:18:21,123 --> 00:18:22,203
Be seated.

393
00:18:22,238 --> 00:18:24,997
MRS. VARGAS, DO YOU HAVE ANY
IDEA WHERE YOUR ATTORNEY IS?

394
00:18:26,336 --> 00:18:27,935
MRS. VARGAS,
I MAY HAVE NO CHOICE

395
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,447
BUT TO DECLARE A MISTRIAL.

396
00:18:34,082 --> 00:18:35,692
FORGIVE MY TARDINESS,
YOUR HONOR.

397
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,147
I'LL BE ACTING AS ATTORNEY
FOR THE PLAINTIFF.

398
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:00,271
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

399
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,798
I'M JOSEPH MILLER. I'M YOUR NEW
COURT-APPOINTED ATTORNEY.

400
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,526
THEY HAVE COURT-APPOINTED
ATTORNEYS FOR CIVIL LAWSUITS?

401
00:19:07,552 --> 00:19:09,863
DO YOU TRUST YOUR GOVERNMENT,
MS. VARGAS?

402
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,495
WHY, YES, OF COURSE.

403
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,039
THEN LET ME HANDLE THIS.

404
00:19:13,538 --> 00:19:15,581
HE'S NEVER GONNA WIN
THIS CASE.

405
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:19,961
-HE JUST HAS TO STALL FOR TIME...
-PERMISSION TO APPROACH THE BENCH?

406
00:19:19,996 --> 00:19:21,541
...LONG ENOUGH FOR QUINT
TO TAKE YOUR OFFER.

407
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:22,716
Come in up.

408
00:19:29,955 --> 00:19:30,684
UH, Y-YOUR HONOR,

409
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:32,693
I DON'T LIKE TO TRASH-TALK,

410
00:19:32,728 --> 00:19:34,725
BUT MY PREDECESSOR
WAS NOT AS THOROUGH

411
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,421
AS HE COULD HAVE BEEN
WHEN PRESENTING THIS CASE.

412
00:19:36,456 --> 00:19:38,871
FOR EXAMPLE, I, UH --

413
00:19:38,906 --> 00:19:41,143
I WOULD LIKE TO ADD SOME
WITNESSES TO THE WITNESS LIST.

414
00:19:41,178 --> 00:19:43,414
IS -- IS THAT
A HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK?

415
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:44,543
YES, IT IS.

416
00:19:44,578 --> 00:19:48,159
YOU SEE, MY INTENT IS TO SHOW
THAT ERNESTO VARGAS LED AN ACTIVE

417
00:19:48,194 --> 00:19:49,808
AND VERY VIBRANT LIFE,

418
00:19:49,843 --> 00:19:51,658
AND THESE 430 PEOPLE
WILL TESTIFY

419
00:19:51,693 --> 00:19:53,785
THAT HE DID SO
EVEN AS A YOUTH.

420
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,417
MOTION DENIED.

421
00:19:56,168 --> 00:19:57,374
O- OKAY.

422
00:19:57,409 --> 00:19:59,689
UM...YOU KNOW,
I HAVE PHOTOS

423
00:19:59,724 --> 00:20:01,588
THAT I WOULD LIKE
TO INTRODUCE

424
00:20:01,623 --> 00:20:03,803
FROM A VACATION --

425
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:05,742
THE OPPOSING COUNSEL WATER-SKIING.

426
00:20:05,777 --> 00:20:08,465
IT'S ALL FROM HIS WEBSITE --
VERY PUBLIC.

427
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,552
I OBJECT.

428
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:10,679
AS WELL YOU SHOULD.

429
00:20:10,714 --> 00:20:12,319
YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT.
SERIOUSLY?

430
00:20:12,354 --> 00:20:13,734
I MEAN, HE DOESN'T
HAVE THE BODY.

431
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:14,637
COUNSELOR,

432
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:15,797
ANYTHING ELSE?

433
00:20:16,557 --> 00:20:17,901
UH, ACTUALLY...

434
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:22,906
I HAVE
QUITE A FEW MORE THINGS.

435
00:20:22,941 --> 00:20:25,561
I JUST FEEL LIKE HE WENT ON
AND ON FOREVER THIS MORNING.

436
00:20:25,596 --> 00:20:26,559
I'M STARVING!

437
00:20:26,594 --> 00:20:27,190
ME TOO.

438
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:29,655
I COULD KILL FOR A STEAK.

439
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,502
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
A VEGETARIAN.

440
00:20:33,221 --> 00:20:35,664
OH, YEAH.
I MEANT A BEAN STEAK --

441
00:20:35,699 --> 00:20:38,465
A STEAK
MADE OUT OF BEANS,

442
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,988
HELD TOGETHER
WITH SOY GLUE.

443
00:20:41,023 --> 00:20:41,907
ALICE,

444
00:20:41,942 --> 00:20:43,158
WE ALL CHEAT A LITTLE.

445
00:20:43,193 --> 00:20:44,408
I MEAN,
I'M A NUTRITIONIST,

446
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,800
AND I SPEND ALL DAY
TEACHING PEOPLE TO EAT HEALTHY.

447
00:20:46,835 --> 00:20:48,659
BUT IF I HAVE A BAD DAY,

448
00:20:48,694 --> 00:20:51,817
I GO HOME AND PLOW
INTO A TUB OF ICE CREAM.

449
00:20:52,964 --> 00:20:53,957
WAIT!

450
00:20:53,992 --> 00:20:54,745
WAIT A SECOND.

451
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,777
THAT WAS A SECRET. YOU JUST
TOLD ME A SECRET, RIGHT?

452
00:20:57,812 --> 00:20:59,217
THAT'S SOMETHING
FRIENDS DO.

453
00:21:00,368 --> 00:21:02,563
WELL, I GUESS SO.
YOU'RE THE NICEST ONE HERE.

454
00:21:02,598 --> 00:21:03,779
REALLY?

455
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:05,873
I MEAN, THANKS.

456
00:21:11,763 --> 00:21:13,024
WHO IS THIS GUY?

457
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:16,602
I WANT EVERY FRAME
OF THIS FOOTAGE ANALYZED.

458
00:21:16,637 --> 00:21:18,865
I WANT THE ANALYSTS
WORKING OVERNIGHT.

459
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,170
I NEED TO
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

460
00:21:20,205 --> 00:21:21,556
LUNCH IS ALMOST OVER.

461
00:21:21,591 --> 00:21:23,100
GET BACK TO THE TRIAL.

462
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:25,906
JOSEPH MILLER --

463
00:21:25,941 --> 00:21:27,688
GEORGETOWN PRE-LAW,

464
00:21:27,723 --> 00:21:29,267
HARVARD LAW WITH HONORS --

465
00:21:29,302 --> 00:21:30,794
THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT.

466
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:32,382
THIS GUY'S HOURLY RATE
HAS TO BE MORE THAN

467
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,200
WHAT OUR GRIEVING
WIDOW MAKES IN A MONTH.

468
00:21:34,235 --> 00:21:35,576
MA'AM,
IT ALL CHECKS OUT,

469
00:21:35,611 --> 00:21:37,398
UNLESS GLORIA VARGAS
FOUND SOME GUY

470
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:40,795
WHO CREATED A C.I.A.- LEVEL
COVER STORY AND FAKE IDENTITY.

471
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,522
WHAT'S MY POSITION
AFTER THE SALE?

472
00:21:42,557 --> 00:21:44,258
I KNOW, AFTER THE SALE,

473
00:21:44,293 --> 00:21:45,476
I HAVE STOCK,

474
00:21:45,511 --> 00:21:47,585
BUT WHAT AM I -- WHAT AM I
DOING IN THE COMPANY?

475
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,479
MAKING POTTERY
IN NEW MEXICO.

476
00:21:49,514 --> 00:21:51,992
WHATEVER YOU LIKE TO DO
WITH YOUR FREE TIME, MR. QUINT.

477
00:21:52,027 --> 00:21:53,537
WELL, WHAT IF I
WANT TO STAY?

478
00:21:53,572 --> 00:21:55,549
I HAVE INVESTED MILLIONS
INTO LIVE HERBALLY.

479
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,834
I HAVE INVESTED
MILLIONS INTO THIS TRIAL.

480
00:21:57,869 --> 00:22:00,402
WHAT EVER YOU WANT
IS IRRELEVANT.

481
00:22:08,776 --> 00:22:10,679
WHY DID YOU OFFER ME
THAT MUCH MONEY?

482
00:22:10,714 --> 00:22:12,446
GETTING NERVOUS
ABOUT YOUR TRIAL?

483
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:14,854
It's twice
what my company's worth.

484
00:22:14,889 --> 00:22:16,845
WAIT. WHO'S THAT?

485
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,279
THE GUY TALKING
TO THE VARGAS LAWYER?

486
00:22:19,314 --> 00:22:21,863
NO. HER.

487
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:23,673
RAID QUINT'S COMPUTER,

488
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:25,691
HIS CALENDAR, HIS E-MAILS.

489
00:22:25,726 --> 00:22:29,194
PULL OUT THE CALL LOGS AND
THE GPS RECORDS FROM HIS PHONE.

490
00:22:29,229 --> 00:22:30,858
I WANT TO KNOW
WHO THAT IS.

491
00:22:31,926 --> 00:22:34,576
INDIA IS A VERY EXCITING PLACE
RIGHT NOW, MR. QUINT.

492
00:22:34,611 --> 00:22:37,750
MILLIONS OF LOCALS WORKING
OUTSOURCED AMERICAN JOBS --

493
00:22:37,785 --> 00:22:39,338
TELEMARKETERS,
CUSTOMER SERVICE --

494
00:22:39,373 --> 00:22:42,338
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY WORKING
GRAVEYARD SHIFT.

495
00:22:42,373 --> 00:22:45,380
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO
DESPERATELY NEED TO STAY AWAKE.

496
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:48,385
FastLife WOULD BE
A SENSATION IN INDIA.

497
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,367
HOW MANY SALES
ARE WE TALKING?

498
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,345
INDIA HAS A BILLION PEOPLE.

499
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,760
ALL I NEED IS FOR YOU TO SETTLE
YOUR CURRENT LEGAL MATTERS.

500
00:22:56,795 --> 00:22:59,433
WE CAN'T GO INTO BUSINESS
WITH YOU WITH BAD PRESS.

501
00:22:59,468 --> 00:23:01,393
EARNSHAW SAYS
IF WE SETTLE,

502
00:23:01,428 --> 00:23:03,171
WE OPEN OURSELVES UP
TO OTHER LAWSUITS.

503
00:23:03,206 --> 00:23:05,043
WE DON'T CARE
ABOUT MORE LAWSUITS.

504
00:23:05,078 --> 00:23:06,809
WITH A BILLION PEOPLE
IN THE WORK FORCE,

505
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,614
A FEW DEATHS
WON'T RAISE AN EYEBROW.

506
00:23:10,882 --> 00:23:12,374
GOVERNMENT
WON'T CRACK DOWN?

507
00:23:12,748 --> 00:23:17,984
MR. QUINT, IT TAKES FIVE YEARS
TO GET A PARKING PERMIT.

508
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:22,156
THI-- THIS TRIAL'S
GOT ME PINNED DOWN.

509
00:23:22,191 --> 00:23:24,363
I- I NEED TO SEE
YOUR OPERATIONS.

510
00:23:24,398 --> 00:23:25,739
OF COURSE.

511
00:23:25,774 --> 00:23:27,274
WELL, I COULD, UH --

512
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:30,672
I COULD ARRANGE A VIDEO CONFERENCE CALL
WITH OUR HOME OFFICE.

513
00:23:30,707 --> 00:23:32,553
OF COURSE, MUMBAI IS
12 HOURS AHEAD OF TIME,

514
00:23:32,588 --> 00:23:35,567
SO IT'LL HAVE TO BE
AROUND MIDNIGHT TONIGHT.

515
00:23:35,602 --> 00:23:38,187
SHALL I SEND A CAR
TO PICK YOU UP?

516
00:23:42,832 --> 00:23:44,169
INCHES AWAY.

517
00:23:45,478 --> 00:23:46,317
NO, NO.

518
00:23:46,352 --> 00:23:49,388
NO, I-I CANNOT STALL
ANY LONGER.

519
00:23:49,423 --> 00:23:51,130
NOW, LISTEN,
THIS IS THE MIDDLE GAME.

520
00:23:51,165 --> 00:23:52,798
THIS IS WHERE WE TRADE PIECES.

521
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,590
WE LOOK FOR WEAKNESSES.

522
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:58,358
YOU HAVE TO BUY SOPHIE
A LITTLE MORE TIME TO MANEUVER.

523
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:02,565
I LITERALLY CANNOT MAKE THIS
SLOWER OR ANY MORE BORING.

524
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,985
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHY THEY SAY
JUSTICE WEARS A BLINDFOLD?

525
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,179
SO YOU CAN'T SEE
THAT JUSTICE IS ASLEEP.

526
00:24:07,214 --> 00:24:09,936
I AM SURE THERE'S
WHOLE RESERVOIRS OF BORING

527
00:24:09,971 --> 00:24:11,664
YOU HAVE YET TO PLUMB.

528
00:24:12,644 --> 00:24:16,248
SLIDE 162. THIS IS --
THIS IS GOOD STUFF.

529
00:24:16,283 --> 00:24:17,298
DR. GOLDFARB, HI.

530
00:24:18,073 --> 00:24:21,670
CAN YOU TELL US
HOW THE CHEMICALS

531
00:24:21,705 --> 00:24:24,956
WORK THEIR WAY
INTO THE NEUROTRANSMITTERS?

532
00:24:26,283 --> 00:24:28,403
IS THIS GOING ANYWHERE,
COUNSELOR?

533
00:24:28,438 --> 00:24:29,821
OH, I ASSURE YOU,
YOUR HONOR,

534
00:24:29,856 --> 00:24:32,292
THE NEXT HUNDRED SLIDES
ARE ESSENTIAL.

535
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,306
Mumbai International Limited
already has a presence in the urban centers.

536
00:24:38,341 --> 00:24:39,618
With FastLife,

537
00:24:39,653 --> 00:24:43,288
we believe we can expand
across the entire continent.

538
00:24:43,323 --> 00:24:44,782
I HAVE TO SAY,
I'M IMPRESSED.

539
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,279
As we are with you.

540
00:24:46,314 --> 00:24:47,988
It's not every day
we can do business

541
00:24:48,023 --> 00:24:50,107
with someone so enlightened.

542
00:24:50,142 --> 00:24:51,503
WELL, IT'S NOT EVERY DAY
I GET AN OFFER

543
00:24:51,538 --> 00:24:55,014
FROM SOMEONE
LIKE MS. SMITHE-PATEL.

544
00:24:59,884 --> 00:25:03,694
I think that you'll find us
a nurturing corporation to grow with.

545
00:25:04,501 --> 00:25:06,733
You'll pardon me.
I'm running late.

546
00:25:06,768 --> 00:25:07,312
YES.

547
00:25:07,347 --> 00:25:08,447
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

548
00:25:08,482 --> 00:25:09,950
THANK YOU, AVI.

549
00:25:13,273 --> 00:25:14,285
SO?

550
00:25:15,537 --> 00:25:16,900
I NEED TO SLEEP ON IT.

551
00:25:17,263 --> 00:25:20,156
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T GIVE YOU
MUCH MORE TIME.

552
00:25:20,672 --> 00:25:23,225
SETTLE YOUR LAWSUIT,
MR. QUINT.

553
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:26,121
THEN I'M SURE
WE CAN DO BUSINESS TOGETHER.

554
00:25:36,061 --> 00:25:38,385
-GOOD. HE'S GOOD.
-WHAT I TELL YOU?

555
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:42,847
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE, DONNIE.

556
00:25:42,882 --> 00:25:44,558
DINNA FASH YERSEL, LADDIE.

557
00:25:44,593 --> 00:25:46,214
-WHAT ARE FRIENDS FOR?
-EXACTLY.

558
00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:48,428
-BEER'S ON ME SOON.
-OH, YOU REMEMBER THA.

559
00:25:51,052 --> 00:25:52,028
-HE'S VERY GOOD.
-WHAT I TELL YOU?

560
00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:00,985
HEY. UH, IS THIS SOMETHING
ALICE WOULD WEAR?

561
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,825
YEAH.
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

562
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,824
RELAX.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

563
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:03,854
QUINT IS GONNA CALL US

564
00:26:03,889 --> 00:26:06,581
AND SETTLE BEFORE WE EVEN
GET TO COURT, SO...

565
00:26:07,293 --> 00:26:08,858
I GUESS ALICE
WASN'T SO BAD.

566
00:26:08,893 --> 00:26:09,988
HER SHOES ARE
MORE COMFORTABLE THAN MINE.

567
00:26:10,023 --> 00:26:11,151
THAT'S BECAUSE
THEY'RE YOUR SHOES.

568
00:26:11,186 --> 00:26:12,276
SHE LIKES RAINY DAYS.

569
00:26:12,311 --> 00:26:13,476
GUYS.

570
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,194
LOOK AT THAT.

571
00:26:18,229 --> 00:26:19,162
Are you kiding?

572
00:26:19,239 --> 00:26:20,679
I can't believe this.

573
00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:21,919
EARNSHAW BOUGHT MUMBAI.

574
00:26:21,954 --> 00:26:24,648
SHE'S PROTECTING HER INVESTMENT,
ELIMINATING THE COMPETITION.

575
00:26:25,095 --> 00:26:26,592
WE ARE SO SCREWED.

576
00:26:27,102 --> 00:26:29,422
SHE JUST SPENT
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

577
00:26:29,457 --> 00:26:31,702
ON A COMPANY
I DON'T REALLY WORK FOR.

578
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:36,528
Sign here.

579
00:26:37,771 --> 00:26:39,529
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?

580
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,003
JUST SIGN THE PAPERS.

581
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,707
HOW DID SHE EVEN KNOW
WE WERE TALKING A DEAL?

582
00:26:54,742 --> 00:26:56,710
'CAUSE THEY'RE NOT JUST
WATCHING THE JURY ROOM.

583
00:26:56,745 --> 00:26:57,955
THEY'RE WATCHINGQUINT.

584
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,020
READING HIS E-MAILS,

585
00:26:59,055 --> 00:27:00,451
TRACING HIS PHONE,

586
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,499
PROBABLY GOT A FEW GUYS
ON HIM.

587
00:27:02,534 --> 00:27:04,121
WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?

588
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:07,287
WE WIN THE TRIAL.

589
00:27:08,786 --> 00:27:10,709
I'M SORRY.
THE IMPOSSIBLE TRIAL?

590
00:27:10,744 --> 00:27:12,693
THE TRIAL
THAT CAN'T BE WON?

591
00:27:12,728 --> 00:27:14,276
YEP. THAT ONE.

592
00:27:16,775 --> 00:27:18,414
NO, NO.
LOOK, YOU TOLD --

593
00:27:18,449 --> 00:27:21,317
YOU TOLD ME
ALL I HAD TO DO WAS STALL.

594
00:27:21,352 --> 00:27:22,899
I CAN'T WIN
A REAL JURY TRIAL.

595
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:23,675
WHY NOT?

596
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,913
I'M NOT A REAL LAWYER!
I'M A PRETEND LAWYER.

597
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:28,012
OH, COME ON, YOU DON'T THINK
SO-CALLED REAL LAWYERS

598
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:30,266
AREN'T JUST PRETENDING AND
TRYING TO BE IN DADDY'S SHOES?

599
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:31,673
BY THE WAY, THE GUY
YOU'RE GOING UP AGAINST

600
00:27:31,708 --> 00:27:33,816
IS GETTING LINES FED TO HIM
FROM SOMEONE IN A WAREHOUSE.

601
00:27:33,851 --> 00:27:36,199
NATE, ALREADY RESTED
MY CASE, OKAY?

602
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:39,414
ALL I HAVE LEFT IS MY CROSS-EXAMINATION
OF THEIR EXPERT AND MY CLOSING.

603
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,862
A JURY IS 12 PEOPLE.

604
00:27:40,897 --> 00:27:42,030
JUST TALK TO THEM.

605
00:27:42,065 --> 00:27:42,954
YOU'VE BEEN DOING IT
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

606
00:27:42,989 --> 00:27:45,609
JUST PUT ON YOUR BOW TIE
AND RING THE DOORBELL.

607
00:27:52,228 --> 00:27:53,404
I CAN'T DO IT.

608
00:27:54,391 --> 00:27:55,564
I CAN'T CONVINCE
A WHOLE JURY.

609
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:58,284
WE WORKED ON PERSUASION
TACTICS ALL WEEK.

610
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,326
YOU DID REALLY WELL.

611
00:27:59,361 --> 00:28:01,009
YEAH, WITH YOU GUYS.

612
00:28:01,044 --> 00:28:02,951
PEOPLE ON THIS JURY
ARE NORMAL.

613
00:28:02,986 --> 00:28:06,425
THERE ISN'T A SINGLE
NORMAL PERSON ON THIS JURY.

614
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,919
THE OLD LADY WHO KNITS
POTHOLDERS AT LUNCH ISN'T NORMAL?

615
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:11,784
THE ONE WHO KEEPS SHOWING YOU
PICTURES OF HER GRANDCHILDREN?

616
00:28:12,117 --> 00:28:15,048
HAVE YOU NOTICED ANYTHING
UNUSUAL ABOUT THE PHOTOGRAPHS?

617
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:15,784
NO.

618
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,940
WELL, SHE HASN'T SEEN THOSE
GRANDCHILDREN IN YEARS.

619
00:28:17,975 --> 00:28:18,630
SHE'S --

620
00:28:18,665 --> 00:28:19,948
SHE'S LYING TO EVERYONE

621
00:28:19,983 --> 00:28:22,651
THAT THEY'RE STILL
ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY.

622
00:28:22,686 --> 00:28:23,722
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

623
00:28:23,757 --> 00:28:27,209
PARKER, I READ PEOPLE
FOR A LIVING.

624
00:28:27,244 --> 00:28:28,816
THAT'S MY THING.

625
00:28:28,851 --> 00:28:31,143
OKAY, CHARLIE,
THE MESSENGER GUY --

626
00:28:31,178 --> 00:28:33,357
YOU KNOW,
THE ONE WITH FIVE KIDS?

627
00:28:33,392 --> 00:28:34,205
GAY?

628
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,420
BULIMIC.

629
00:28:36,171 --> 00:28:39,709
TREVOR, THE FRAT BOY,
HOWEVER -- YEAH, SUPERGAY.

630
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:44,491
WHAT ABOUT PEGGY?

631
00:28:44,526 --> 00:28:47,579
ACTUALLY, PEGGYIS
DISGUSTINGLY NORMAL.

632
00:28:47,614 --> 00:28:48,649
BUT THE REST OF THEM --

633
00:28:48,684 --> 00:28:51,805
THEY ALL HAVE
THEIR OWN ALICE WHITE.

634
00:28:51,805 --> 00:28:55,131
YOU JUST -- YOU JUST HAPPENED
TO GIVE YOURS A NAME.

635
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:06,884
OKAY, WE DON'T HAVE
COURT TODAY,

636
00:29:06,884 --> 00:29:09,482
BUT WE DO HAVE
SOME WORK TO DO.

637
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:11,879
AM I GONNA LIKE
THIS WORK?

638
00:29:11,914 --> 00:29:14,422
UH, NOT THE FIRST PART.

639
00:29:21,441 --> 00:29:22,788
WE'RE FOLLOWING QUINT NOW.

640
00:29:31,913 --> 00:29:33,113
DANG!

641
00:29:33,123 --> 00:29:34,230
WHERE'D THIS GUY
COME FROM?

642
00:29:34,265 --> 00:29:34,936
YOU ALL RIGHT?

643
00:29:34,971 --> 00:29:35,969
MAN!

644
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:59,026
PLANTED THE DEVICE
IN QUINT'S ENGINE,

645
00:29:59,611 --> 00:30:02,346
TOOK CARE OF THE GUYS
THAT EARNSHAW SENT AFTER QUINT.

646
00:30:02,381 --> 00:30:03,544
AND YOU SHOULD HAVE HIM

647
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:08,624
IN...THREE, TWO...

648
00:30:09,367 --> 00:30:10,630
...ONE.

649
00:30:29,312 --> 00:30:30,492
PROBLEM?

650
00:30:36,658 --> 00:30:39,041
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?
I'M CLOSE TO RESTING MY CASE.

651
00:30:39,076 --> 00:30:40,728
MY CAR JUST DIED.

652
00:30:40,763 --> 00:30:42,168
I'LL GET THERE WHEN I CAN.

653
00:30:43,348 --> 00:30:44,646
YOU SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

654
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:47,326
ARE YOU KIDDING? I'VE BEEN
OFF THE GRID FOR YEARS.

655
00:30:47,361 --> 00:30:48,148
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

656
00:30:48,183 --> 00:30:49,755
ELECTRIC CAR'S
A GOOD WAY TO START,

657
00:30:49,755 --> 00:30:52,520
BUT YOU CAN MAKE FUEL
FROM YOUR OWN BODILY WASTE.

658
00:30:52,555 --> 00:30:53,967
DO YOU COMPOST?

659
00:30:54,002 --> 00:30:57,016
THE FEELING WHEN --
WHEN YOU CLOSE THE DIGESTIVE-TO-

660
00:30:57,051 --> 00:30:58,343
INTERNAL COMBUSTION CYCLE --

661
00:30:58,378 --> 00:30:59,605
I CALLED TRIPLE "A."

662
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,062
-YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.
-NO, IT'S --

663
00:31:01,097 --> 00:31:02,198
IT'S -- IT'S OKAY.

664
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:03,800
HERE'S -- HERE'S YOUR
PROBLEM RIGHT HERE.

665
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,572
WHERE?

666
00:31:04,607 --> 00:31:05,701
-IT'S JUST RIGHT HERE.
-THAT?

667
00:31:05,736 --> 00:31:07,804
IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THAT, YOU'LL
SEE WHERE YOUR PROBLEM IS.

668
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,576
I'M LOOKING, BUT I DON'T KNOW
MUCH ABOUT CARS.

669
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:11,791
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING
AT ALL.

670
00:31:11,826 --> 00:31:12,625
WHAT IS THIS?

671
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:21,209
MR. VARGAS HAD
AN ENLARGED AORTA,

672
00:31:21,244 --> 00:31:24,390
POSSIBLY THE RESULT
OF RHEUMATIC FEVER AS A CHILD.

673
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:26,408
THIS IS WHAT CAUSED
HIS HEART ATTACK.

674
00:31:26,443 --> 00:31:27,895
SO, IN YOUR MEDICAL OPINION,

675
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:32,269
WHAT ROLE DID FastLife PLAY
IN MR. VARGAS' DEATH?

676
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:35,085
IT PLAYED NO ROLE
WHATSOEVER.

677
00:31:35,556 --> 00:31:37,116
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS,
YOUR HONOR.

678
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:39,600
YOUR WITNESS, MR. MILLER.

679
00:31:42,827 --> 00:31:44,553
I'M -- I'M SORRY.

680
00:31:45,097 --> 00:31:46,377
FOR WHAT?

681
00:31:46,412 --> 00:31:47,673
ME.

682
00:31:48,205 --> 00:31:49,247
YOU DESERVE BETTER.

683
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,318
YOU'RE THE BEST LAWYER
WE EVER HAD.

684
00:31:51,353 --> 00:31:52,957
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

685
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,883
WE'RE WAITING,
MR. MILLER.

686
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,066
RIGHT AWAY, YOUR HONOR.

687
00:32:01,062 --> 00:32:02,426
DR. PATEMKIN...

688
00:32:03,105 --> 00:32:06,456
UH, THIS IS NOT YOUR FIRST TIME
TESTIFYING AS AN EXPERT, IS IT?

689
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:07,337
NO, IT IS NOT.

690
00:32:07,372 --> 00:32:10,010
NO, NO. IN FACT, YOU'VE TESTIFIED ALL
ACROSS THE COUNTRY --

691
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:13,022
HOUSTON, CHICAGO,
ST. LOUIS. IS THAT CORRECT?

692
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:13,947
YES.

693
00:32:13,982 --> 00:32:15,594
THAT IS,
UNTIL LAST YEAR.

694
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:16,772
FOR THE LAST 12 MONTHS,

695
00:32:16,807 --> 00:32:18,780
YOU'VE TESTIFIED ONLY IN
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA?

696
00:32:18,815 --> 00:32:20,898
-THAT SOUNDS RIGHT.
-OBJECTION -- RELEVANCE?

697
00:32:20,933 --> 00:32:23,178
IT GOES TO HIS QUALIFICATIONS,
YOUR HONOR.

698
00:32:25,349 --> 00:32:26,699
NOW,
FOR THIS LAST YEAR,

699
00:32:26,734 --> 00:32:30,216
YOU'VE ONLY TESTIFIED IN TRIALS
THAT YOU COULD DRIVE TO.

700
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:31,804
I WOULDN'T CHARACTERIZE IT
LIKE THAT.

701
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:34,091
IS THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE ON
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S NO-FLY,

702
00:32:34,126 --> 00:32:38,225
OR, AS IT'S MORE COMMONLY KNOWN,
THE TERRORIST WATCH LIST?

703
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,878
I'M ON THE LIST,
BUT I'M NOT A TERRORIST.

704
00:32:40,913 --> 00:32:42,304
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT
SEEMS TO THINK SO.

705
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:43,730
WHY ELSE WOULD THEY
PUT YOU ON A LIST

706
00:32:43,765 --> 00:32:46,425
WITH SUCH PEOPLE
AS OSAMA bin LADEN,

707
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,547
SHEIKH KHALID MOHAMMED?

708
00:32:47,582 --> 00:32:50,099
LOOK, YES,
I'M ON THE NO-FLY --

709
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,498
TERRORIST -- TERRORIST.

710
00:32:51,533 --> 00:32:55,857
...NO-FLY LIST, BUT IT HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH TERRORISM.

711
00:32:58,649 --> 00:33:00,032
THERE WAS AN INCIDENT.

712
00:33:00,067 --> 00:33:01,966
OH, INCIDENT.
OKAY.

713
00:33:02,616 --> 00:33:04,753
WOULD THAT HAPPEN TO BE
THE INCIDENT

714
00:33:04,788 --> 00:33:07,379
ON FLIGHT 732
OUT OF ST. LOUIS,

715
00:33:07,414 --> 00:33:10,946
WHERE YOU -- YOU FONDLED
A FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S BUTTOCKS?

716
00:33:10,981 --> 00:33:12,961
OR WOULD THAT HAPPEN
TO BE THE INCIDENT

717
00:33:12,996 --> 00:33:17,088
ON FLIGHT 1433
OUT OF CHICAGO,

718
00:33:17,123 --> 00:33:19,600
WHERE YOU DRANK
17 TINY MARGARITAS,

719
00:33:19,635 --> 00:33:20,790
YOU TOOK YOUR PANTS OFF,

720
00:33:20,825 --> 00:33:22,199
YOU STOOD UP ON THE DRINK CART,

721
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:23,426
AND YOU SANG, QUOTE,

722
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:24,672
"I'M A SEXY MONKEY"?

723
00:33:24,707 --> 00:33:26,231
I HAVE NO RECOLLECTION
OF THAT.

724
00:33:26,266 --> 00:33:27,367
I'M NOT SURPRISED,

725
00:33:27,402 --> 00:33:29,050
BECAUSE IT WAS NOT ONE,

726
00:33:29,085 --> 00:33:29,897
IT WASN'T TWO,

727
00:33:29,932 --> 00:33:32,715
BUT IT WAS 22 INCIDENTS
OF DRUNK AND BELLIGERENT,

728
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,773
GRAB-ASSY BEHAVIOR
THAT LANDED YOU ON THAT LIST.

729
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:35,541
MR. MILLER.

730
00:33:35,576 --> 00:33:36,270
-OBJECTION!
-**

731
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,711
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOUR HONOR?

732
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,965
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS
DETERMINED THAT THIS MAN

733
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,569
IS NOT QUALIFIED TO RIDE ON AN
AIRPLANE, LIKE OSAMA bin LADEN.

734
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,843
HOW IS THIS JURY
SUPPOSED TO RELY ON HIM

735
00:33:45,878 --> 00:33:48,163
TO RENDER
A SOUND MEDICAL OPINION?

736
00:33:48,198 --> 00:33:50,217
-IT DOESN'T --
-NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

737
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,481
I'M IN RECOVERY.

738
00:33:51,516 --> 00:33:52,769
WE ARE DONE.

739
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,970
YOU MAY STEP DOWN, DR. PATEMKIN.

740
00:34:00,653 --> 00:34:02,339
SOPHIE,
GIVE ME AN UPDATE.

741
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,466
I'VE HIT
THREE OUT OF FIVE.

742
00:34:08,867 --> 00:34:10,076
OKAY, WRAP IT UP.

743
00:34:10,111 --> 00:34:12,282
HARDISON'S ABOUT TO GIVE
HIS CLOSING STATEMENT.

744
00:34:13,229 --> 00:34:14,241
MR. MILLER.

745
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:17,791
YOU KNOW, A WEEK AGO,
YOU WERE ALL STRANGERS.

746
00:34:17,826 --> 00:34:20,105
AND THEN THE SAME THING
HAPPENED TO ALL OF YOU.

747
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,392
YOU GOT THAT ENVELOPE.

748
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:22,133
YOU KNOW THE ONE.

749
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:23,516
COMES IN THE MAIL.

750
00:34:23,551 --> 00:34:25,543
IT SAYS "COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES"
ON THE TOP.

751
00:34:25,578 --> 00:34:27,431
YOU OPEN IT LIKE THIS --
"OH, GOD."

752
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:28,360
YOU KNOW.

753
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:33,085
A WEEK PASSES.

754
00:34:33,581 --> 00:34:36,035
YOU WATCH THE WITNESSES
PARADE THROUGH.

755
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,859
YOU LISTEN
TO THE LAWYERS ARGUE.

756
00:34:37,894 --> 00:34:40,161
SUDDENLY, YOU'RE NOT
STRANGERS ANYMORE.

757
00:34:40,196 --> 00:34:43,031
SOME OF YOU
HAVE EVEN MADE FRIENDS.

758
00:34:43,908 --> 00:34:46,222
IT'S NOT AS BAD
AS YOU THOUGHT, RIGHT?

759
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:51,021
BUT THEN THE JUDGE
ASKS YOU TO DELIBERATE.

760
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:54,249
THEN YOU HAVE
A MOMENT OF DOUBT.

761
00:34:54,284 --> 00:34:55,820
"I'M NOT A DOCTOR
I'M NOT A SCIENTIST.

762
00:34:55,855 --> 00:34:59,085
"HOW CAN I TELL IF ERNESTO VARGAS
DIED FROM USING FastLife?

763
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,245
H- HOW CAN I BE SURE?"

764
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,318
BUT THAT ENVELOPE
ENTRUSTED YOU

765
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:07,205
WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT
OBLIGATION OF CITIZENSHIP,

766
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,589
AND THAT IS
TO FIND THE TRUTH.

767
00:35:08,624 --> 00:35:11,285
IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE DARE
NOT GIVE IT TO ONE PERSON

768
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,003
BUT TO 12 STRANGERS.

769
00:35:14,503 --> 00:35:15,881
NOW, ALL I ASK IS THAT YOU --

770
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:19,328
YOU GO INTO THAT ROOM
AND YOU WORK TOGETHER

771
00:35:19,363 --> 00:35:20,967
AND YOU FIND THE TRUTH.

772
00:35:22,893 --> 00:35:25,492
I HAVE FAITH THAT YOU'LL REACH
A JUST DECISION.

773
00:35:38,901 --> 00:35:40,385
TAKE IT
AS A COMPLIMENT.

774
00:35:42,368 --> 00:35:43,341
HOW'S PARKER DOING?

775
00:35:43,376 --> 00:35:44,237
LET'S FIND OUT.

776
00:35:49,486 --> 00:35:50,395
YEAH,

777
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,617
IT'S THE END GAME --

778
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:53,192
ALL ON HER NOW.

779
00:36:18,815 --> 00:36:20,062
IT'S ODD.

780
00:36:20,097 --> 00:36:20,950
WHAT?

781
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:24,628
WE TAKE A JUROR,

782
00:36:24,663 --> 00:36:27,331
AND OUR JUROR GETS REMOVED.

783
00:36:27,366 --> 00:36:28,970
WE TAKE THEIR LAWYER.

784
00:36:29,005 --> 00:36:30,690
ANOTHER LAWYER SHOWS UP.

785
00:36:30,725 --> 00:36:32,270
A COMPANY TRIES TO TAKE QUINT.

786
00:36:32,305 --> 00:36:34,028
I TAKE THE COMPANY.

787
00:36:34,063 --> 00:36:37,187
IT'S ALMOST...

788
00:36:39,627 --> 00:36:40,750
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

789
00:36:41,713 --> 00:36:42,530
OKAY.

790
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:44,276
THOSE ARE MY ARGUMENTS,

791
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:47,134
WHY I THINK WE SHOULD DECIDE,
YOU KNOW?

792
00:36:47,169 --> 00:36:49,952
I KNOW I'M JUST ONE OF YOU GUYS,

793
00:36:49,987 --> 00:36:52,033
BUT THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

794
00:36:52,068 --> 00:36:55,407
WHY DON'T WE TAKE A POLL
TO SEE WHERE EVERYONE STANDS?

795
00:36:55,442 --> 00:36:59,166
WHO HERE FINDS IN FAVOR OF THE
DEFENDANT, LIVE HERBALLY?

796
00:37:01,233 --> 00:37:02,628
YES!

797
00:37:10,211 --> 00:37:11,610
IT'S OURS!

798
00:37:11,645 --> 00:37:12,829
QUINT'S ON HIS WAY OVER.

799
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:14,469
YOU CAN TELL HIM THE GOOD NEWS.

800
00:37:14,504 --> 00:37:17,723
WE ARE NOT GOING TO TELL
MR. QUINT ANYTHING.

801
00:37:17,758 --> 00:37:19,595
DO YOU KNOW WHY HE DIDN'T
SHOW UP IN COURT TODAY?

802
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,968
CALLED ME ON HIS CELL,
SAID HIS CAR BROKE DOWN.

803
00:37:22,003 --> 00:37:25,431
I'VE BEEN TRACKING QUINT
VIA HIS PHONE'S GPS.

804
00:37:25,466 --> 00:37:27,134
HE TOLD YOU HIS CAR WAS DEAD,

805
00:37:27,169 --> 00:37:32,159
BUT WE PINGED HIM VISITING SEVERAL LOCAL
OFFICES OF MY TOP COMPETITORS.

806
00:37:32,194 --> 00:37:35,593
HE WAS OUT THERE
SEARCHING FOR A BETTER OFFER.

807
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:41,075
TIME TO TEACH MR. QUINT
ABOUT KARMA.

808
00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:42,836
ANY NEWS?

809
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:44,235
NOT YET.

810
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,978
LET'S TALK BUSINESS.

811
00:37:47,238 --> 00:37:48,018
NOW?

812
00:37:48,053 --> 00:37:48,808
BEFORE THE VERDICT?

813
00:37:48,843 --> 00:37:50,590
I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA WAIT
TILL AFTER WE WON.

814
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:53,655
THIS TRIAL HAS GIVEN ME
NEW PERSPECTIVE.

815
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:57,197
NOW I KNOW THAT YOUR COMPANY
DOES NOT JUST HAVE ONE PRICE.

816
00:37:57,232 --> 00:37:58,420
IT HAS THREE.

817
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,739
IF YOU WIN THE TRIAL,

818
00:38:01,774 --> 00:38:04,981
YOUR COMPANY IS WORTH THIS MUCH.

819
00:38:06,464 --> 00:38:08,388
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

820
00:38:08,423 --> 00:38:11,075
ASSUMING, OF COURSE, THAT YOU CAN
FIND SOMEONE WILLING TO PAY IT.

821
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:15,754
AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE
MUMBAI INTERNATIONAL LIMITED, IS IT?

822
00:38:17,233 --> 00:38:19,833
IF YOU LOSE THE TRIAL,

823
00:38:19,868 --> 00:38:23,276
YOUR COMPANY
IS WORTH THIS MUCH.

824
00:38:23,311 --> 00:38:26,353
BUT IF YOU SELL TO ME
RIGHT NOW,

825
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:29,561
YOUR COMPANY IS WORTH...

826
00:38:30,396 --> 00:38:31,916
THIS MUCH.

827
00:38:32,772 --> 00:38:34,780
I'M THE ONE
TAKING THE RISK HERE.

828
00:38:35,483 --> 00:38:37,250
CHANCE.

829
00:38:37,626 --> 00:38:38,833
CERTAINTY.

830
00:38:38,868 --> 00:38:44,319
NOW, MR. QUINT, I KNOW
THAT YOU ARE A SPIRITUAL MAN,

831
00:38:44,354 --> 00:38:47,862
JUST HOW MUCH
DO YOU TRUST FATE?

832
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:59,522
YOU'VE MADE
A GOOD DECISION.

833
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,289
HELLO?

834
00:39:02,832 --> 00:39:04,193
JURY'S BACK.

835
00:39:06,736 --> 00:39:08,015
THANK YOU.

836
00:39:18,721 --> 00:39:19,944
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY,

837
00:39:19,979 --> 00:39:21,805
HAVE YOU
REACHED A VERDICT?

838
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:24,236
WE HAVE, YOUR HONOR.

839
00:39:24,271 --> 00:39:26,588
MADAM FOREMAN,
PLEASE READ THE VERDICT.

840
00:39:26,623 --> 00:39:28,766
IN THE MATTER
OF GLORIA VARGAS ET AL

841
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:31,408
VERSUS LIVE HERBALLY INCORPORATED,

842
00:39:31,443 --> 00:39:33,880
THE JURY FINDS
IN FAVOR OF...

843
00:39:33,915 --> 00:39:35,639
THE PLAINTIFF...

844
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:36,382
YES!

845
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:38,455
...IN THE AMOUNT
OF $5 MILLION.

846
00:39:42,576 --> 00:39:44,206
WHAT THE HELL
JUST HAPPENED?

847
00:39:49,849 --> 00:39:53,188
WHO HERE FINDS IN FAVOR OF
THE DEFENDANT, LIVE HERBALLY?

848
00:39:55,131 --> 00:39:57,566
WHO WANTS PIZZA FOR LUNCH?

849
00:40:07,391 --> 00:40:10,598
WHO HERE FINDS IN FAVOR OF
THE DEFENDANT, LIVE HERBALLY?

850
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:19,650
WHO HERE FINDS IN FAVOR OF
THE DEFENDANT, LIVE HERBALLY?

851
00:40:21,515 --> 00:40:22,994
IT'S OURS.

852
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:23,653
YOU!

853
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:25,124
THIS IS YOUR FAULT!

854
00:40:25,159 --> 00:40:26,214
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

855
00:40:26,249 --> 00:40:27,774
YOU WENT LOOKING
FOR A BETTER OFFER.

856
00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:29,181
WE TRACKED YOU
ON YOUR CELLPHONE

857
00:40:29,216 --> 00:40:31,121
WHEN YOU HAD YOUR MEN
BEAT UP MY SECURITY DETAIL!

858
00:40:31,156 --> 00:40:32,440
WHAT MEN? I DON'T HAVE MEN.

859
00:40:32,475 --> 00:40:33,970
I- I WEAR SANDALS.

860
00:40:34,005 --> 00:40:35,595
AND I HAVEN'T
BEEN ANYWHERE.

861
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,301
Sophie, give me an update.

862
00:40:37,336 --> 00:40:39,573
I'VE HIT
THREE OUT OF FIVE.

863
00:40:45,339 --> 00:40:47,541
DO YOU HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT, MISS?

864
00:40:47,576 --> 00:40:48,861
UM, NO.

865
00:40:49,341 --> 00:40:51,930
BUT I WAS JUST LEAVING.

866
00:40:55,709 --> 00:40:56,778
REMEMBER ME?

867
00:40:58,822 --> 00:41:01,045
LOOKS LIKE
YOU SHOULD HAVE SETTLED.

868
00:41:24,393 --> 00:41:26,240
OH, SWEET MERCY.
COOKED FLESH.

869
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:31,670
CAN WE HAVE FAST FOOD EVERY TIME
WE MAKE THE BAD GUYS GO AWAY?

870
00:41:32,761 --> 00:41:34,459
DID YOU REALIZE
WHAT YOU JUST DID?

871
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:37,142
WHAT YOU DID -- YOU WON
A JURY TRIAL WITHOUT CHEATING.

872
00:41:37,177 --> 00:41:40,220
WITHOUT CHEA-- I HACKED
A GOVERNMENT NO-FLY LIST

873
00:41:40,255 --> 00:41:42,169
AND USED IT
TO HUMILIATE A WITNESS.

874
00:41:42,204 --> 00:41:44,180
EXCESSIVELY -- "CHEATING
EXCESSIVELY" IS WHAT I MEANT.

875
00:41:44,215 --> 00:41:45,116
BUT, I MEAN,
THINK ABOUT IT,

876
00:41:45,151 --> 00:41:46,990
I MEAN, IF YOU APPLIED
YOURSELF, HARDISON,

877
00:41:47,025 --> 00:41:49,125
YOU COULD BE
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

878
00:41:50,312 --> 00:41:51,879
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I COULD. I COULD.

879
00:41:51,914 --> 00:41:54,665
YOU KNOW, NEXT WEEK, I THINK
I'M GONNA BE AN ASTRONAUT.

880
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,623
WELL, THAT'S NOT REALLY
WHAT I MEANT.

881
00:41:55,658 --> 00:41:56,768
I MEANT IF YOU STUDIED --

882
00:41:56,803 --> 00:41:58,653
YEAH, IF I --
WHO NEEDS TO STUDY?

883
00:41:58,688 --> 00:42:00,021
YOU KNOW,
I'M GONNA BE A SURGEON.

884
00:42:00,056 --> 00:42:02,541
A SURGEON -- E.R.

885
00:42:03,347 --> 00:42:04,319
SURGEON.

886
00:42:05,673 --> 00:42:07,150
HEY, IT'S PEGGY FROM THE TRIAL!

887
00:42:07,185 --> 00:42:09,195
SHE WANTS TO HAVE COFFEE
NEXT WEEK.

888
00:42:11,755 --> 00:42:13,198
ALICE MADE A FRIEND.

889
00:42:13,233 --> 00:42:15,030
I'M GONNA TELL YOU
ONE MORE TIME.

890
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,604
YOU MADE A FRIEND,

891
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:18,060
NOT ALICE.

892
00:42:18,095 --> 00:42:19,340
OH, COOL.

893
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:22,266
WELL, THINK SHE'D WANT TO
STEAL A PAINTING WITH ME?

894
00:42:22,906 --> 00:42:24,795
START SMALL, PARKER.

895
00:42:25,252 --> 00:42:26,481
TRY COFFEE.

896
00:42:27,242 --> 00:42:28,108
OKAY.
