1
00:00:01,514 --> 00:00:03,527
Problem, observation...

2
00:00:04,195 --> 00:00:05,470
Hypothesis...

3
00:00:05,859 --> 00:00:06,951
Research,

4
00:00:07,557 --> 00:00:08,638
experiment...

5
00:00:09,816 --> 00:00:11,961
- What's the last one?
- Conclusion.

6
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:17,658
Ms. Salazar,

7
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:20,728
I'm here on behalf
of the internal revenue service

8
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:23,981
- to collect on your delinquent taxes.
- I don't understand.

9
00:00:24,276 --> 00:00:25,717
I'm on a payment plan.

10
00:00:25,842 --> 00:00:28,052
I just spoke
with my account manager last week.

11
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:30,290
You didn't get the notice?

12
00:00:31,454 --> 00:00:33,065
That agreement has been canceled.

13
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,201
That agreement has been canceled.

14
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:37,703
- What? Mom?
- Go to your room, Lydia.

15
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,063
We'll put a lien on your house.

16
00:00:42,744 --> 00:00:44,506
We have the right to do that.

17
00:00:47,587 --> 00:00:49,533
I-s that what you want?
What? No!

18
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:51,133
I told you, I am paying it.

19
00:00:52,822 --> 00:00:54,130
What do you want from me?

20
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:56,681
Give me a credit card.
I'll make this all go away.

21
00:00:57,652 --> 00:00:59,630
Or I come back with the sheriff,

22
00:00:59,755 --> 00:01:01,102
and we lock you out.

23
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:03,790
Tonight.

24
00:01:05,293 --> 00:01:06,482
Your choice.

25
00:01:19,218 --> 00:01:20,218
Here.

26
00:01:30,065 --> 00:01:32,466
When I contacted the IRS,
they said they never received

27
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,300
the money.
But someone maxed out my credit card.

28
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,689
If it wasn't the IRS, then who?

29
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:40,808
Probably the same people who have been,
targeting taxpayers all over Boston.

30
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,711
- You're not alone, Clara.
- Well,

31
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,590
it isn't just the money.

32
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,676
This man humiliated me.

33
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:48,784
He scared my daughter.

34
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,615
We're gonna find out who did this,
and get your money back. I promise.

35
00:01:53,393 --> 00:01:54,238
Mr. Ford,

36
00:01:54,993 --> 00:01:56,539
I play by the rules.

37
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,910
After I got laid off, I was paying
off my debt a little at a time,

38
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:03,205
and I could still put food
on the table every night.

39
00:02:04,984 --> 00:02:06,667
What do I tell my daughter now?

40
00:02:07,796 --> 00:02:10,186
You tell her the same thing
you tell her every day.

41
00:02:10,423 --> 00:02:11,589
Don't give up.

42
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,493
The rich and powerful
take what they want.

43
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,219
We steal it back for you.

44
00:02:25,356 --> 00:02:28,856
Sometimes, bad guys
make the best good guys.

45
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,794
We provide leverage!

46
00:02:34,997 --> 00:02:37,198
Look, all I'm saying is,
is I don't understand

47
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,689
why we can't have a couple of days
off in between jobs.

48
00:02:39,814 --> 00:02:41,667
We just spent 10 days in Juarez.

49
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,735
What's the matter?
You don't like the pinatas?

50
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,208
No time off, all right? We got
a lot of work to do. Hardison, run it.

51
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,899
The first rule of crime
is follow the money.

52
00:02:52,224 --> 00:02:53,506
Ms. Salazar's money ran

53
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,217
through 3 different shell companies
before it ended up with this guy.

54
00:02:56,786 --> 00:02:59,053
Hugh Whitman.
He runs a big debt collection agency

55
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,722
right outside of Boston
called financial support associates.

56
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,475
It makes sense. He's got bill collectors
already on his payroll.

57
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,645
He just sends them after people
that owe back taxes. He keeps the money.

58
00:03:08,257 --> 00:03:10,678
But the names of those people,
they're not public.

59
00:03:10,803 --> 00:03:12,840
So how does he know who to target?

60
00:03:12,965 --> 00:03:15,736
Whitman worked for the IRS for 20 years.
He probably had

61
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,496
a friend leak him a list.

62
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,482
I got it! I got it!

63
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:23,612
We steal the list.

64
00:03:26,793 --> 00:03:27,863
We need a way in.

65
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,436
What did you find out about Whitman
on the Internet?

66
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:32,328
- Nothing.
- What do you mean nothing?

67
00:03:32,453 --> 00:03:33,587
He's not on the net.

68
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,923
At all. Which is strange because
his company deals

69
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,592
with such high tech. They do
this thing where they spoof your caller

70
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,387
I. D to make it seem like your grandma
calling, when it's really one

71
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,973
- of their bill collectors. Sweet.
- Go back to the money.

72
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,351
You said Whitman routed money through
three different shell companies, right?

73
00:03:47,992 --> 00:03:50,271
- Where is it now?
- Somewhere in the boondocks

74
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,815
at a bank called Turner Creek.
It's under an account

75
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,942
named "patriot limited."
There's no ties

76
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,445
to Whitman,
and that's why the cops can't touch him.

77
00:03:57,812 --> 00:03:59,738
Good. We can work with that.

78
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:03,124
I want a two-pronged attack.
One team is gonna go convince Whitman

79
00:04:03,249 --> 00:04:05,113
his money isn't safe there
at the bank.

80
00:04:05,238 --> 00:04:07,705
- Me and Hardison got the bank.
- We're doing what, now?

81
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,374
After you have spooked Whitman,

82
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,419
Sophie, you go and hook him
with a new place to stash his cash.

83
00:04:13,868 --> 00:04:14,670
Questions?

84
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:28,767
I'll fix it. We can fix it.

85
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:30,644
We'll fix it. It's okay.

86
00:04:32,888 --> 00:04:35,504
I don't know what you're
complaining about. I got us the bank.

87
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:38,120
We're in, we're out, and we get
to go throw a worm in the water.

88
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,779
All so you can go fishing
in the woods.

89
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,220
I don't see why I had to come.

90
00:04:43,345 --> 00:04:46,721
Because it'll be good for you. When's
the last time you've been outdoors?

91
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,569
Did you see that mosquito?
That thing had a beak, man.

92
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:55,625
What's that smell?

93
00:04:56,058 --> 00:04:57,388
It's fresh air.

94
00:04:58,015 --> 00:04:59,131
I don't like it.

95
00:05:06,158 --> 00:05:07,620
Who's in charge here?

96
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,561
- How can I help you?
- I'll tell you how you can help us.

97
00:05:12,864 --> 00:05:14,021
This is Agent Brody,

98
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,608
I'm Agent Quint, with the criminal
investigation unit of the IRS.

99
00:05:17,963 --> 00:05:19,293
what can I do for you?

100
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:22,571
We need the records of all the accounts
in the name of patriot limited.

101
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,658
Of course. Right this way.
I'll get them for you.

102
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,717
Have a seat here.

103
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:30,942
We don't get many folks
way out here.

104
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:32,581
Why don't you just have a seat

105
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,932
and I'll bring
that account right up?

106
00:05:47,478 --> 00:05:50,462
Mr. Whitman,
my name is Colette Madison.

107
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:53,310
We have some mutual friends
over at the IRS.

108
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:55,894
Go ahead TS MANQUANT
With human resources.

109
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:58,190
It's about your account
at Turner Creek bank.

110
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,903
I don't have an account
at Turner Creek bank.

111
00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:04,947
No, but patriot limited does.

112
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:08,212
And that's you.

113
00:06:10,785 --> 00:06:11,785
May I?

114
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:31,811
Who are you?

115
00:06:36,164 --> 00:06:37,896
Think of me as a matchmaker.

116
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,357
I bring together parties
who can benefit each other.

117
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,192
For a fee, of course.

118
00:06:42,586 --> 00:06:44,903
- I don't need your help.
- Unfortunately, you do.

119
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,866
I'm here to tell you that your money
isn't safe at Turner Creek bank anymore.

120
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:51,368
Not now.

121
00:06:51,735 --> 00:06:52,806
It's urgent.

122
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:57,166
<i>Good timing, Sophie. Now, Eliot
and Hardison should be finishing up</i>

123
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,717
- <i>at the bank right about now.</i>
- Come on.

124
00:07:06,087 --> 00:07:07,760
- What?
- Just got a call from one

125
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,303
of our men at the bank.
There are two agents from the IRS

126
00:07:10,428 --> 00:07:12,195
asking about your accounts.

127
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:17,269
You call Chester.
Tell him to get rid of them.

128
00:07:27,366 --> 00:07:29,031
They're there already, aren't they?

129
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:32,912
How did you know?

130
00:07:33,549 --> 00:07:34,598
I told you.

131
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,247
I have friends at the IRS.

132
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:39,246
They're on to you, Mr. Whitman.

133
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,754
If you know my former department
at the IRS,

134
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,981
then you probably know Charlie Dean.

135
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:46,507
How is the old boy?

136
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:50,552
Now, that must be Whitman's source
inside the IRS.

137
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,013
- we need Hardison.
- No, we don't.

138
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:57,708
I want you to tell him that
the last time you saw Charles

139
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,436
was at his funeral.

140
00:08:03,353 --> 00:08:04,662
Haven't you heard?

141
00:08:05,128 --> 00:08:06,490
I'm so sorry.

142
00:08:06,857 --> 00:08:08,620
It was a beautiful service.

143
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:10,966
All right.

144
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:14,187
You have my attention, Ms. Madison.

145
00:08:16,684 --> 00:08:18,771
If my bank isn't safe, what is?

146
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:21,552
I want to introduce you to someone

147
00:08:21,677 --> 00:08:24,294
who runs an alternative
financial institution.

148
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:27,589
How'd you know that?

149
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,759
Do you know when I'm gonna die?
Do you?

150
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:33,175
What?

151
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:35,818
You think that was enough
to spook Whitman?

152
00:08:35,943 --> 00:08:37,029
Don't know.

153
00:08:37,243 --> 00:08:40,100
Comms and mobiles don't work up here,
we have to call Nate from a land line.

154
00:08:40,225 --> 00:08:43,105
Yeah, you can use the phone
at the bait shop while I tackle us up.

155
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,149
We'll grab something to eat.
Come on!

156
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,275
Look at me.

157
00:08:46,662 --> 00:08:48,652
I look like somebody eats
at a bait shop?

158
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,938
You fellas are gonna
want to come with me.

159
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,613
- Excuse you?
- Make any sudden moves

160
00:08:54,738 --> 00:08:56,905
and my boys
will blow your heads right off.

161
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:21,656
12.

162
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:23,896
This van is old.
I bet if we rush that door,

163
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:26,732
- we could pop the lock. You ready?
- Shut up.

164
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:29,892
I'm trying to get us out of here.
What are you doing?

165
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:32,778
I'm drawing a map, Hardison.


166
00:09:44,236 --> 00:09:45,375
Mr. Whitman,

167
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:47,628
welcome to your new bank.

168
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,239
You're kidding me, right?

169
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,937
Come with me.

170
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,967
Come on, ladies!
Let's kick it up a notch!

171
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,723
That's right!

172
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:03,339
Let's make this a party!

173
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,069
Come on, girls.

174
00:10:06,194 --> 00:10:08,649
You've got cats at home
that can pedal faster than that!

175
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,192
That's it for me. I'm done.

176
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,070
I've got to go.

177
00:10:23,465 --> 00:10:25,454
Yeah, is this the manager?

178
00:10:26,156 --> 00:10:29,640
All right, listen. This is Oscar,
from corporate. We've spoken before.

179
00:10:29,765 --> 00:10:33,045
You know that new, ladies gym that's,
down there on 14th street?

180
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,949
Yeah, they're poaching your members
over there at your place.

181
00:10:36,074 --> 00:10:38,814
They offering a free membership to anyone
who breaks their contract with you.

182
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,431
So what I need you to do right now
is go down there

183
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,895
and get the skinny on what's going on.
Go! Go now!

184
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,312
What's going on?
Where'd everybody go?

185
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,114
Hugh Whitman,

186
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,074
Vic Pellington.
He's the owner.

187
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,618
Come on in. Have a seat.

188
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,954
What do you think
of our operation we got here?

189
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,510
Well, it's a low-rent gym
for housewives.

190
00:11:06,905 --> 00:11:09,316
- Doesn't look like a bank to me.
- No, that's true. Yeah.

191
00:11:09,441 --> 00:11:11,243
One of them is... is nothing.

192
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:13,329
But you get five of these places,

193
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:16,916
- it's a money-laundering machine.
- Vic owns 25 images franchises.

194
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:20,073
He sells interests
to discerning businessmen

195
00:11:20,198 --> 00:11:22,639
like yourself looking to hide
the source of their income.

196
00:11:22,897 --> 00:11:25,058
That only works
when you have customers to explain

197
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,492
the cash flow.
This place is empty.

198
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:29,643
That's the beauty
of the health-club industry,

199
00:11:29,768 --> 00:11:32,000
because 80% of the people,
they pay the membership

200
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,567
but they never come.

201
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,152
Have a seat.

202
00:11:36,944 --> 00:11:39,448
We have all these names...
Name after name of these members

203
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,868
- that never come in in our databank.
- Give Vic your money to wash

204
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,287
and he just adds names
to the membership roster.

205
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,664
Your dirty money
becomes clean profit.

206
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:51,168
- So she gets a finder's fee?
- She does.

207
00:11:51,684 --> 00:11:53,545
- What about you?
- My rake is 15%.

208
00:11:54,322 --> 00:11:56,798
Yeah, but with that,
what you get is you get detailed

209
00:11:57,219 --> 00:12:00,010
papers that show that you're
an investor in images

210
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,262
for over a year.
You get board-meeting minutes.

211
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,930
It's all on the up.

212
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,391
- Okay, what's the catch?
- The only catch

213
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,429
is that I need an answer now,
today, because...

214
00:12:10,783 --> 00:12:13,982
I got one slot left, okay,
and you're not the only bidder.

215
00:12:14,545 --> 00:12:17,569
All right, I'm gonna want to look
at what you think are detailed records.

216
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,253
Yeah. Sure.
I got...

217
00:12:19,814 --> 00:12:21,814
I'm very intimate
with the tax code, Vic.

218
00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:23,028
I used to be

219
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:25,968
district manager
with the internal revenue service.

220
00:12:26,617 --> 00:12:27,537
That's cool.

221
00:12:29,377 --> 00:12:31,344
Internal revenue service.

222
00:12:32,393 --> 00:12:35,796
Taking money from hard-working Americans
and shipping it straight to China.

223
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:42,734
You smell that?

224
00:12:42,859 --> 00:12:45,222
Smell of death? Yes, I do.
Look, that's not even real.

225
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,307
Right?
See, I make those up from a little...

226
00:12:50,763 --> 00:12:52,104
Turner Creek minutemen.

227
00:12:52,698 --> 00:12:54,395
Anti-government militia, huh?

228
00:12:54,676 --> 00:12:57,012
Anti-government freedom fighters.

229
00:12:58,244 --> 00:12:59,986
They say the war is coming, tax man,

230
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:02,130
but it's already begun.

231
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:04,898
What do you call a man
who takes your property,

232
00:13:05,806 --> 00:13:07,536
enriches your adversaries,

233
00:13:07,784 --> 00:13:09,773
and deprives you of your liberty?

234
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:12,999
Your enemy.

235
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,812
Consider yourselves casualties
of war.

236
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,518
It ain't gonna happen, Bubba.

237
00:13:32,326 --> 00:13:35,029
- I got one standing and one kneeling.
- Make it work.

238
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,695
Hold up, man!
Can I at least get a cigarette?

239
00:13:41,962 --> 00:13:43,488
- What?
- Can I get a cigarette?

240
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,248
As an enemy combatant,

241
00:13:45,865 --> 00:13:48,059
I'm entitled
to one last cigarette according

242
00:13:48,184 --> 00:13:49,745
to Geneva convention article 89,

243
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,538
paragraph 3, subsection K.

244
00:13:56,714 --> 00:13:58,044
Are we combatants or not?

245
00:14:04,262 --> 00:14:05,886
Give the man a cigarette.

246
00:14:13,495 --> 00:14:14,603
Those menthol lights?

247
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,612
Come on, now.

248
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:31,981
Go on. Take your time.

249
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,326
It's over there, man.

250
00:14:38,942 --> 00:14:41,463
- For God's sake, Brandon!
- For God's sake Brandon!

251
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:45,801
Come on!

252
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:47,260
Fire!

253
00:14:47,772 --> 00:14:50,453
- You see that? That's called a plan!
- What plan, man?

254
00:14:50,697 --> 00:14:52,892
Smoke cigarettes and die?

255
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,560
- This way!
- Come on! Get those dogs!

256
00:14:55,902 --> 00:14:57,794
Get those dogs over here! Now!

257
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,535
Yes, hello, Mr. Wallach?
This is Alexandra from F.S.A.

258
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,724
I'm calling about
the outstanding balance you have with...

259
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,135
Amherst...

260
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:15,173
Amherst oncology center?

261
00:15:21,876 --> 00:15:24,027
It looks like we got disconnected.

262
00:15:25,684 --> 00:15:27,133
<i>Delete. Delete.</i>

263
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,207
Parker, why aren't you
in Whitman's office yet?

264
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,704
'Cause it's my first day at work.

265
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:41,334
On my way now.

266
00:15:46,717 --> 00:15:48,447
What you mean, stop?
Why we stop running?

267
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,721
Listen to me.

268
00:15:49,846 --> 00:15:51,993
The van was averaging 45 miles
an hour, right?

269
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,774
We were in there for 22 minutes.

270
00:15:55,531 --> 00:15:57,304
We took two turns off the highway.

271
00:15:57,429 --> 00:16:00,299
That's 17 miles north of town.
We need to go South.

272
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:01,920
That's South.

273
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,855
- Says you and what compass?
- This compass, man!

274
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,963
Some of us were born
with good direction!

275
00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:10,066
How about some sense? That's uphill.
Running downhill is faster.

276
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:11,979
That's proven science.

277
00:16:16,086 --> 00:16:17,491
One, two, three.

278
00:16:18,197 --> 00:16:20,532
- Damn it! Again?
- You got a tell, man.

279
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:45,299
If I were a super-secret
government document,

280
00:16:45,424 --> 00:16:47,016
where would I hide?

281
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:44,604
Guys, I found the list,
but that's not all I found.

282
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,228
I found guns.

283
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,198
Geez.
Sorry, I... go ahead.

284
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:56,658
I got to take this call.

285
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,540
What?!

286
00:18:00,297 --> 00:18:03,289
<i>Looks like he's stealing
from the taxpayers to buy weapons.</i>

287
00:18:04,874 --> 00:18:05,834
And flags.

288
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,341
Flags? What kind of flags?

289
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:09,504
<i>White with a green tree
inside a blue shield</i>

290
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,871
with a star and a ribbon around it.
It says

291
00:18:12,098 --> 00:18:15,406
"<i>ense petit placidam,
sub libertate quietem.</i>"

292
00:18:15,531 --> 00:18:18,464
"By the sword we seek peace,
but only under liberty."

293
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:21,102
That's from
the Massachusetts state flag. The tree,

294
00:18:21,227 --> 00:18:23,232
that's from the original
<i>colonial flag.</i>

295
00:18:23,357 --> 00:18:25,645
- So he's a historian.
- With an arsenal.

296
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,185
No wonder we can't find anything about
this guy online.

297
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,823
He's got a <i>little secret.
I'm gonna try something.</i>

298
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,801
I'm so sorry.
The local council

299
00:18:32,926 --> 00:18:35,276
wants to up handicap ramps
all over the parking lot.

300
00:18:35,556 --> 00:18:37,980
Next thing you know,
we're gonna have to put braille in the,

301
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:40,493
on the free weights. It's getting
to be ridiculous, these people.

302
00:18:41,693 --> 00:18:43,997
Is that your yellow hummer
over there ?

303
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,789
- That it is.
- Boy, that's a sweet ride, huh?

304
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,044
- Well-made machine.
- Yeah, a beauty.

305
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:50,497
She's nice.

306
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,631
I appreciate a man
who buys American,

307
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,426
I'll tell you that.
Used to work for the government myself.

308
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,136
I'm going back a few years, but,

309
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:01,385
back then, we all believed
in the same principles. It's true.

310
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,348
It's true.

311
00:19:03,523 --> 00:19:05,737
Yeah, the system, it's broken down.

312
00:19:05,862 --> 00:19:07,687
- It certainly is.
- Whatever happened

313
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,731
to "by the people,
for the people," huh?

314
00:19:10,014 --> 00:19:12,045
I spent 20 years with the IRS.

315
00:19:13,455 --> 00:19:16,393
You think after all that time
and all that money I collected,

316
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:19,699
any of it went to protect
the interest of real Americans?

317
00:19:20,314 --> 00:19:22,202
No. We just hand it off
to other agencies.

318
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,330
They dole it out to welfare cheats
and border jumpers

319
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,374
and whatever black-hole programs
keep the incumbents

320
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,673
in office.

321
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,171
Yeah, taxpayers these days...

322
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:37,967
They're a bunch of sheep. Just blind
followers who don't even realize

323
00:19:38,254 --> 00:19:41,387
their liberty is under constant assault
by the government that they've elected.

324
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,392
- It's pathetic.
- Preaching to the choir.

325
00:19:46,778 --> 00:19:49,854
That money that,
the IRS is looking for in that bank?

326
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,546
I told you. It's not mine.
It belongs to the revolution.

327
00:19:53,505 --> 00:19:54,692
And it's coming.

328
00:19:55,536 --> 00:19:57,862
That's why you got
to act fast, Hugh.

329
00:19:58,312 --> 00:19:59,697
You've got those,

330
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,616
those IRS agents snooping around.

331
00:20:02,664 --> 00:20:04,257
I wouldn't worry about them.

332
00:20:04,635 --> 00:20:05,954
I had them taken care of.

333
00:20:11,321 --> 00:20:12,794
<i>I've got to get back to my office.</i>

334
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,060
Why don't you meet me there
with your records,

335
00:20:15,185 --> 00:20:17,799
and I will try to give you
an answer today.

336
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,426
Pleasure to meet you.

337
00:20:23,978 --> 00:20:27,078
Parker, have you talked
to Eliot or Hardison today?

338
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:32,272
They could be out of range, or...

339
00:20:34,235 --> 00:20:36,467
Or in a lot of trouble.

340
00:20:40,644 --> 00:20:42,081
I don't like it, Nate.

341
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:44,774
Eliot and Hardison should
have checked in by now.

342
00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:46,744
- We should call the police.
- Tell them what?

343
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:50,389
Two of our friends are
impersonating IRS agents at a bank?

344
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:52,674
Whitman said, "I took care of them."

345
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,919
Parker and I will find the boys.
You go close Whitman.

346
00:20:56,698 --> 00:20:59,465
Wait.
We've got to get them off our scent.

347
00:21:02,314 --> 00:21:04,818
- What's that?
- Just rub it on you! It's skunkweed.

348
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:07,015
It'll get the dogs off our scent!

349
00:21:07,401 --> 00:21:09,786
- Rub it on your damn body!
- I can taste the smell in my mouth.

350
00:21:09,911 --> 00:21:10,878
It's strong.

351
00:21:12,192 --> 00:21:13,642
Put it on you, man!

352
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,503
All right. High five.

353
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,989
A high five for morale!

354
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:28,287
- What the hell, man?
- I know what I'm doing!

355
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,526
Gangrene, man! Gangrene!
You know what?

356
00:21:30,651 --> 00:21:34,278
We wouldn't even be in this mess
if you ain't wanted to go fishing!

357
00:21:34,403 --> 00:21:36,408
I could have taken you
down to mama's fish shack

358
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:39,892
and got you a catfish, two pieces,
and a biscuit for $5.99.

359
00:21:40,017 --> 00:21:43,429
But instead you got us out here with
trigger-happy Joes trying to fish us!

360
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:45,470
And he's all too happy
to shoot himself a Negro!

361
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,133
So it's a black thing now? Is that it?
They're hunting me, too?

362
00:21:48,258 --> 00:21:51,070
Damn Skippy, it's a black thing!
Who they try to shoot first, Eliot?

363
00:21:51,195 --> 00:21:52,685
Who got punched first, Eliot?

364
00:21:53,135 --> 00:21:56,229
- Me! I'm about tired of this redneck...
- Damn it, Hardison!

365
00:21:56,354 --> 00:21:58,251
- Damn it, Eliot!
- I know what I'm doing.

366
00:21:58,376 --> 00:22:00,898
- I've done this before.
- This, right here?

367
00:22:01,023 --> 00:22:03,074
- In the woods, handcuffed to a man?
- I have, okay?

368
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:05,684
- It was easier last time, though.
- Why?

369
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:07,659
'Cause he was already dead.

370
00:22:09,256 --> 00:22:10,256
Good boy.

371
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:15,953
This way.

372
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,628
What do you got?

373
00:22:19,753 --> 00:22:22,623
I've got a map... part of a map.
I don't know what it means.

374
00:22:22,748 --> 00:22:24,672
What if Eliot and
Hardison have already...

375
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:26,911
Let's go in here.

376
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,564
Hardison and Eliot,
they need us to stay calm,

377
00:22:32,689 --> 00:22:35,657
show me what you got,
and, we'll figure out how to save them.

378
00:22:36,554 --> 00:22:37,272
Guys!

379
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,986
<i>Eliot, Hardison! Can you hear me?</i>

380
00:22:39,111 --> 00:22:40,105
Wait. Stop.

381
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,087
Nate? You're breaking up, man!

382
00:22:42,212 --> 00:22:43,861
We're in the woods.
We're approximately

383
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,463
<i>17 miles from the bank.</i>

384
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:51,856
- Damn it. Can you hear him?
- No, man. It's cloud cover.

385
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:54,998
Day like this, we got to bounce
our signal off a radio tower.

386
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,566
How do we do that?

387
00:22:56,927 --> 00:22:58,827
Get a clear view of the sky.

388
00:23:02,335 --> 00:23:03,631
Okay. Here it is.

389
00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:08,202
That's Whitman's militia camp.
It doesn't show where.

390
00:23:08,327 --> 00:23:11,055
Now, Eliot said they were 17 miles
from the bank. Let's get...

391
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,022
It's got to be in here somewhere.

392
00:23:19,618 --> 00:23:21,357
From the bank... to here.

393
00:23:22,385 --> 00:23:23,485
Right there.

394
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,529
It's same creek, isn't it?

395
00:23:27,088 --> 00:23:29,020
Yeah, no paved roads.
No people for miles.

396
00:23:29,145 --> 00:23:30,616
In the middle of nowhere.

397
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:33,202
- <i>Nate? Can you hear me?</i>
- Hardison? Are you okay?

398
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,417
Can't talk very loud.
These militia guys are following us,

399
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:42,378
and they're armed
and I'm pretty sure we pissed them off.

400
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,381
<i>Listen... now, there</i>

401
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,801
are railroad tracks a mile and a half
west of the camp. Can you get there?

402
00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:50,845
Sure. But what if there's no train?

403
00:23:51,162 --> 00:23:53,522
There will be.
We're gonna steal you one.

404
00:23:56,007 --> 00:23:59,198
Your records are very thorough.
Very impressive.

405
00:23:59,517 --> 00:24:02,823
I do have some questions about
the profit sharing, however.

406
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:10,448
The nuts and bolts are
really Vic's forte.

407
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,866
Where is he?

408
00:24:12,263 --> 00:24:16,254
- I thought he was coming with you.
- He's here. He's on a conference call.

409
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:21,046
Money laundering... it isn't
all champagne and helicopters, is it?

410
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,570
Excuse me.

411
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:28,108
Hate being away from the job.
I love collecting money.

412
00:24:34,422 --> 00:24:36,266
Okay, Nate. I'm in.

413
00:24:38,455 --> 00:24:40,023
Let's go steal a...!

414
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,911
<i>What I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna </i>call your station.

415
00:24:44,036 --> 00:24:46,453
You're gonna patch me through to
the department of transportation.

416
00:24:46,578 --> 00:24:49,041
<i>Now, use the company's
caller-I.D. spoofing software</i>

417
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:51,673
<i>to make my call look like
it's coming from Fitchburg.</i>

418
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,409
Okay. You're on.

419
00:24:59,171 --> 00:25:00,642
Massdot, this is Bev.

420
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:01,973
I'm sorry to bother you.

421
00:25:02,098 --> 00:25:04,052
I'm walking my dogs
out here in Fitchburg.

422
00:25:04,177 --> 00:25:07,409
It like you got a problem on your track.
A bunch of rocks blocking the way.

423
00:25:07,534 --> 00:25:08,487
Are you sure?

424
00:25:08,612 --> 00:25:10,591
I haven't heard anything
about a rockslide.

425
00:25:10,716 --> 00:25:11,997
Yeah, am I sure?

426
00:25:12,122 --> 00:25:15,765
Listen, I'm sending you a picture
on my celly right now.

427
00:25:23,276 --> 00:25:24,097
Yes, sir.

428
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:25,606
<i>We'll do our best.</i>

429
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:29,594
- <i>It's a big problem.</i>
- We'll try to... Please hold, sir.

430
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:33,180
- Massdot, this is Bev.
- Is this the train department?

431
00:25:33,305 --> 00:25:35,324
You got to send someone
out to Fitchburg.

432
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,244
Please hold, ma'am.

433
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,789
<i>We got rocks!</i>
Rocks on the tracks! Yeah.

434
00:25:42,358 --> 00:25:43,358
Big rocks!

435
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,962
Hey, Gary, I got to re-route
the northbound Barrington.

436
00:25:49,152 --> 00:25:51,012
We got a rockslide.

437
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:01,077
Eliot, Hardison, a train on the way.

438
00:26:01,202 --> 00:26:02,820
It's coming from Pennsylvania.

439
00:26:02,945 --> 00:26:05,646
It's a produce train carrying beets.

440
00:26:10,581 --> 00:26:12,290
I'll take that as a good sign.

441
00:26:12,415 --> 00:26:15,679
Like I said,
I still have a few questions.

442
00:26:15,804 --> 00:26:17,878
But we do see the
world the same way.

443
00:26:18,003 --> 00:26:19,621
And that counts for something.

444
00:26:21,403 --> 00:26:23,127
God! Come on, man!

445
00:26:24,387 --> 00:26:25,833
I hate beets.

446
00:26:26,027 --> 00:26:27,960
Let's go! Come on!

447
00:26:28,897 --> 00:26:30,296
So? Do we have a deal?

448
00:26:30,906 --> 00:26:33,507
You will have a check by
the end of business day.

449
00:26:35,013 --> 00:26:36,594
To the revolution.

450
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:38,980
<i>All right, Sophie. Good work.</i>

451
00:26:39,105 --> 00:26:41,797
<i>The train is on its way
to pick up the boys.</i>

452
00:26:41,922 --> 00:26:43,017
<i>We're home free.</i>

453
00:26:48,381 --> 00:26:51,341
He did it, man! He actually did it!
He stole it!

454
00:26:51,466 --> 00:26:53,028
How's your train-jumping skills?

455
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,899
I ain't no hobo,
but I can hold my own.

456
00:26:55,024 --> 00:26:56,364
All right. Don't move!

457
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:04,419
Put your hands up!

458
00:27:04,647 --> 00:27:07,405
Man, what do you want us to do?
You're the ones that put this on us.

459
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,626
- All right, go down.
- Why you always twist it.

460
00:27:10,751 --> 00:27:12,606
- Not like that!
- Re-phrase that! Go under.

461
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,574
Why you always telling me
to go down, Eliot?

462
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,008
I'm not saying it like that!

463
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,940
- Just hold on a minute!
- Shut up!

464
00:27:18,065 --> 00:27:19,836
- Can we get a minute?
- The man has a gun.

465
00:27:19,961 --> 00:27:21,817
- Go under. Go!
- Twist it this way. Geez!

466
00:27:21,942 --> 00:27:23,623
- Look, man...
- it ain't that hard.

467
00:27:23,748 --> 00:27:25,479
- It's not that hard.
- He's so difficult.

468
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:26,644
Shut up!

469
00:27:34,781 --> 00:27:37,530
Let me tell you something...
You're time's up!

470
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,490
We get new recruits every day.

471
00:27:40,115 --> 00:27:41,784
You can't stop what we have planned.

472
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,035
No one can.

473
00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:49,055
Come on, man. Let's go.

474
00:27:50,244 --> 00:27:51,168
All right.

475
00:27:51,665 --> 00:27:52,410
Wait.

476
00:27:52,535 --> 00:27:54,169
We got to get on this train.

477
00:27:54,294 --> 00:27:56,129
No. What'd you smell in that camp?

478
00:27:56,254 --> 00:27:58,745
- What? I don't...
- What were you smelling at the camp?

479
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:01,429
- We got to get on this train right now!
- What were you smelling?

480
00:28:03,355 --> 00:28:05,766
Fertilizer. And molasses.

481
00:28:06,746 --> 00:28:10,573
You can reduce the molasses down and
use it as an oil for a fertilizer bomb?

482
00:28:10,698 --> 00:28:13,307
I've seen it in Lebanon.
It's better than kerosene.

483
00:28:13,432 --> 00:28:15,064
So a fertilizer bomb and a van.

484
00:28:15,189 --> 00:28:17,388
That's what the little hillbilly
was crying about.

485
00:28:17,513 --> 00:28:18,906
We get on this train?

486
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,492
We get back there, we call the FBI.
They clear everybody out.

487
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,191
Was the bomb mixed already?

488
00:28:23,316 --> 00:28:24,702
Is it stable?

489
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,623
They got to use it
within the next 48 hours.

490
00:28:29,346 --> 00:28:32,084
We call the FBI.
Maybe they make it, maybe they don't.

491
00:28:32,606 --> 00:28:35,101
What happens then? We're watching
a building blow up on the news,

492
00:28:35,226 --> 00:28:37,323
children, firemen
scattered everywhere?

493
00:28:37,448 --> 00:28:40,051
I say we go back
down there, and we stop them.

494
00:28:47,937 --> 00:28:50,010
I say we whup some hillbilly ass.

495
00:28:54,195 --> 00:28:56,445
We're gonna get bloody on this one.

496
00:29:01,431 --> 00:29:02,978
All right. Come on, man.

497
00:29:04,732 --> 00:29:07,083
I'm gonna grab his walkie-talkie.
You get his shoelaces,

498
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:08,683
and you get his belt.

499
00:29:08,808 --> 00:29:10,158
I'm getting this.

500
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,018
What do you say we
lose about 180 pounds?

501
00:29:21,074 --> 00:29:22,687
How's the new girl doing?

502
00:29:26,426 --> 00:29:28,849
Nate, we've lost contact with
Eliot and Hardison again.

503
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,835
<i>They're probably on the train.</i>

504
00:29:31,339 --> 00:29:34,841
All right, but what about Sophie?
When's she getting Whitman's check?

505
00:29:35,057 --> 00:29:36,307
Get me Whitman.

506
00:29:39,205 --> 00:29:40,205
Excuse me.

507
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,785
Sir, we have a problem.

508
00:29:49,575 --> 00:29:50,329
I see.

509
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,211
No, I'll take care of
things on this end.

510
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,281
I have to get to the
bank and get my money.

511
00:30:03,406 --> 00:30:06,178
There's no telling what
those idiots out there are liable to do.

512
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:10,933
Our cover's blown.
The revolution's starting early.

513
00:30:11,764 --> 00:30:15,126
<i>Our cover's blown.
The revolution's starting early.</i>

514
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:41,012
They're locking the building down.
I'm gonna try and stall Owens.

515
00:30:41,247 --> 00:30:44,424
If I can make the elevator think
there's a fire, the doors won't open.

516
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:46,928
<i>All right. Good.</i>
I'll find us a way out.

517
00:30:48,164 --> 00:30:50,389
<i>If Whitman is spooked,
he's gonna go for his money.</i>

518
00:30:50,838 --> 00:30:53,058
So we have to get to the bank
before he does.

519
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:57,355
<i>Eliot, Hardison, can you hear me?
Where are you on the train?</i>

520
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:00,357
Yeah, Nate, that didn't happen.

521
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,774
What do you mean it didn't happen?
What... you're not on the train?

522
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:05,070
Don't worry about it.

523
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:08,326
<i>You're telling me you're gonna go toe-
to-toe with these people without a plan?</i>

524
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:09,617
We got a plan.

525
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,452
It's called C.W.A.

526
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,420
Can of whup ass.

527
00:31:23,998 --> 00:31:26,745
Take the stairwell to the first floor.
There are too many eyes in the lobby.

528
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:29,311
- We're using the emergency exit.
- On my way.

529
00:31:44,985 --> 00:31:45,945
Come on!

530
00:31:50,007 --> 00:31:51,307
Nate, it worked.

531
00:31:52,436 --> 00:31:54,985
The elevators are on
automatic emergency protocol.

532
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,123
They're all headed
to the ground floor.

533
00:31:59,676 --> 00:32:00,668
What the hell?

534
00:32:03,034 --> 00:32:05,131
- Did you get them?
- I'm on it, sir.

535
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,217
Get it done. I'm holding you
personally responsible.

536
00:32:16,832 --> 00:32:19,123
How are we gonna get out
without being seen?

537
00:32:19,617 --> 00:32:22,665
- We can't hack the security system.
- I think of something more direct.

538
00:32:23,531 --> 00:32:24,245
Go!

539
00:32:34,731 --> 00:32:35,731
Stop them!

540
00:32:36,381 --> 00:32:37,204
Stop them!

541
00:32:40,421 --> 00:32:41,172
God!

542
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:51,353
- You feeling confident?
- Not really.

543
00:32:51,924 --> 00:32:53,053
Good.

544
00:32:53,464 --> 00:32:56,451
'Cause overconfidence will
kill you faster than a bullet any day.

545
00:32:57,662 --> 00:32:59,749
- Fear's good.
- I have fear.

546
00:33:00,024 --> 00:33:02,896
And doubt. And really serious regrets.
I should be fine.

547
00:33:03,461 --> 00:33:05,065
All right. Get ready, then.

548
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,888
Science. It works.

549
00:33:56,756 --> 00:33:58,806
Don't make any sudden movement.

550
00:34:02,224 --> 00:34:03,049
Move.

551
00:34:10,057 --> 00:34:11,548
I need to make a withdrawal.

552
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,716
Right now.

553
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,610
Mr. Whitman. Yes, of course.
Take a seat.

554
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:24,853
Good work, Tommy.

555
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:27,398
Where you gonna put the van,
Chester?

556
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:30,166
An office building?
A preschool? A church?

557
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:32,945
A soldier knows there are
casualties in every war.

558
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,152
See, that's the difference
between a real soldier

559
00:34:36,544 --> 00:34:38,784
and this little Halloween
outfit you got going on.

560
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,541
You'd kill to protect your rights.

561
00:34:45,846 --> 00:34:49,003
A real soldier?
He'd die protecting somebody else's.

562
00:34:50,642 --> 00:34:52,806
- Yeah, come on.
- Wait.

563
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:56,010
I never did get that cigarette.

564
00:34:56,445 --> 00:34:57,302
Kill them.

565
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,889
I tell you, man. I think I know
where your cigarette's at.

566
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,475
- I think I saw it right over there.
- Right there?

567
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:42,808
Whitman's gone.

568
00:35:49,946 --> 00:35:50,898
You all right?

569
00:35:57,787 --> 00:35:58,614
High five.

570
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,080
For morale.

571
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:03,952
Yo, incoming. Go!

572
00:36:12,832 --> 00:36:13,837
Chester!

573
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,548
Chester,
what the hell happened here?

574
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:21,925
What the hell's going on?
Never mind. Never mind.

575
00:36:22,577 --> 00:36:24,723
There's too much heat
on the organization right now.

576
00:36:25,146 --> 00:36:28,101
I have to get out of town.
I want you take them to a safe house.

577
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:30,604
Give me the keys to your truck.
Come on! Hurry up!

578
00:36:33,788 --> 00:36:36,084
Next time I steal
you a train, get on it.

579
00:36:36,209 --> 00:36:38,562
You're not gonna rain
on my parade today, Nate.

580
00:36:38,687 --> 00:36:40,989
I made a bomb.
Out of a menthol light.

581
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,728
It's over there, man.

582
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:46,537
For God's sake, Brandon!

583
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,719
You got a radio?

584
00:36:58,019 --> 00:37:00,854
- What frequency are they on?
- Seven seven two.

585
00:37:00,979 --> 00:37:03,804
I will be in touch with further
instructions when it's safer.

586
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,749
- All right?
- <i>All units move in.</i>

587
00:37:05,874 --> 00:37:08,211
- What's that?
- <i>We have a GPS location of the camp.</i>

588
00:37:08,336 --> 00:37:10,574
<i>ATF airborne is incoming.</i>

589
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:12,402
ATF? That's the feds.

590
00:37:12,527 --> 00:37:14,766
- The feds are coming!
- Be advised.

591
00:37:14,891 --> 00:37:18,277
We have a cooperating
witness on the site.

592
00:37:18,547 --> 00:37:21,989
Apprehend,
but do not injure Hugh Whitman.

593
00:37:24,082 --> 00:37:24,950
What?

594
00:37:25,171 --> 00:37:28,328
- Guys, hold it. Wait a minute.
- I should have known...

595
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,581
Once a government man,
always a government man.

596
00:37:30,955 --> 00:37:33,881
Wait, I gave you training.
I gave you equipment.

597
00:37:34,006 --> 00:37:35,315
I handle the money.

598
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:37,486
Let's see the money.

599
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:38,898
Here.

600
00:37:41,186 --> 00:37:41,942
There!

601
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:44,970
Wait a minute.

602
00:37:46,915 --> 00:37:48,473
This was straight from the bank.

603
00:37:53,128 --> 00:37:55,190
Who knew a Sedan could hit 140?

604
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:58,775
Parker, you are never to get behind
the wheel of a car again, okay?

605
00:37:59,262 --> 00:38:00,235
Never.

606
00:38:24,957 --> 00:38:25,908
Wait...

607
00:38:26,033 --> 00:38:28,578
Hey, guys, I'm a fellow patriot!

608
00:38:28,703 --> 00:38:31,224
The evidence you were gonna sell
to the feds for your freedom?

609
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,027
What?
Chester, think!

610
00:38:33,152 --> 00:38:35,685
This only hangs me!
We're being played. We're being set up.

611
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,472
- The money must be back at the bank.
- You ain't lying about one thing.

612
00:38:38,597 --> 00:38:39,728
We need to hide out.

613
00:38:39,853 --> 00:38:42,891
So let's go into town and
get our money, Whitman.

614
00:38:43,016 --> 00:38:45,197
And maybe we don't shoot you.

615
00:38:47,114 --> 00:38:48,114
Move it.

616
00:38:51,269 --> 00:38:52,399
All right!

617
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,043
Move it! Give me the keys!

618
00:39:00,956 --> 00:39:04,185
Hey, you know, I'm starting
to enjoy the outdoors.

619
00:39:04,964 --> 00:39:08,053
Hey, are you seriously gonna
let them get away with this?

620
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,071
Eliot, I stole you a train.

621
00:39:10,356 --> 00:39:11,890
Have a little faith.

622
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:19,739
- What's going on, Whitman?
- I don't know.

623
00:39:20,615 --> 00:39:22,153
They were just in here.

624
00:39:25,144 --> 00:39:26,024
Hello?

625
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:29,410
Hello?

626
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:32,019
Hands in the air.

627
00:39:32,192 --> 00:39:33,257
Don't move.

628
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,877
FBI! Let me see your hands!
Get 'em up!

629
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:43,088
Get down! Get on the ground!

630
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,347
That's not my case.
It got switched.

631
00:39:52,653 --> 00:39:54,850
Are these the stolen
papers you mentioned?

632
00:39:57,213 --> 00:39:58,061
You!

633
00:39:59,035 --> 00:40:01,356
Internal IRS documents.

634
00:40:02,514 --> 00:40:04,776
Mr. Whitman,
you and your men are under arrest.

635
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,414
Wait a minute!
You got to listen to me!

636
00:40:08,051 --> 00:40:11,283
That woman isn't who she says she is!
She's a con artist!

637
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:14,812
We get that all the time.
It's all one big conspiracy.

638
00:40:14,937 --> 00:40:17,476
Yeah, you better run a psych
eval on that one?

639
00:40:28,815 --> 00:40:30,302
I'm trying to tell you.

640
00:40:33,173 --> 00:40:34,681
And that guy! He's part of it, too!

641
00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:38,474
I'm telling you!
Why don't you listen to me?!

642
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:39,561
Listen!

643
00:40:49,854 --> 00:40:52,616
Mr. Ford, I don't know what to say.

644
00:40:53,674 --> 00:40:55,557
Thank you. All of you.

645
00:40:55,682 --> 00:40:58,040
I know you've been out of work
for a little while.

646
00:40:58,532 --> 00:41:01,194
Do you think you could help
us find the names on this list

647
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:03,683
and help them get their,
uh, their money back?

648
00:41:04,624 --> 00:41:07,964
It's only a part-time job, but I think
you'll find it really rewarding.

649
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:09,370
I'll drive.

650
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:12,177
No. No, no, no. I'll drive.

651
00:41:23,227 --> 00:41:24,573
Reel it in slow.

652
00:41:24,698 --> 00:41:26,856
I know how to do it, man.
I heard you.

653
00:41:26,981 --> 00:41:29,360
- See, you lost it.
- There's no talking in...

654
00:41:30,281 --> 00:41:31,946
That was the beauty of fishing!

655
00:41:32,071 --> 00:41:35,158
You're tense. It's a delicate sport.
You need to be delicate.

656
00:41:37,255 --> 00:41:38,605
You got it!

657
00:41:45,156 --> 00:41:46,692
It's just not the same.

658
00:41:48,126 --> 00:41:49,242
You're right.

659
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,940
It's better.

660
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:58,459
Yeah, buddy.
