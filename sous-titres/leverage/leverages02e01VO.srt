5
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:11,655
You found that stolen Monet in Florence,...

6
00:00:11,656 --> 00:00:14,126
saved your company a $25 million payout.

7
00:00:14,127 --> 00:00:18,004
That identity-theft case,
you saved $15 million.

8
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:20,782
So, what have you been
up to for the last year?

9
00:00:20,783 --> 00:00:24,141
Working with individual
clients. Confidential.

10
00:00:24,142 --> 00:00:26,638
Nice. Solving rich people's problems.

11
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:29,574
Actually, the other way around.

12
00:00:31,847 --> 00:00:35,156
Well, glad to have you here.
Welcome back to the insurance game.

13
00:00:35,157 --> 00:00:39,719
<i>Great, there's lots of files I'd like you to
review from our international branches.</i>

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,814
<i>Bangkok,...</i>

15
00:00:41,493 --> 00:00:42,656
<i>London,...</i>

16
00:00:43,554 --> 00:00:44,703
<i>Madrid,...</i>

17
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:47,295
<i>Mexico City,...</i>

18
00:00:48,484 --> 00:00:49,921
<i>Los Angeles.</i>

19
00:00:51,904 --> 00:00:55,568
Let's start you as a consultant, work high-
profile recoveries on a commission basis,...

20
00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:58,127
and get you an office, maybe.

21
00:00:58,751 --> 00:01:00,038
Mr. Ford?

22
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:01,602
Mr. Ford?

23
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:04,796
Was it something I said?

24
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:11,037
Zoe, it's...

25
00:01:11,364 --> 00:01:13,778
It's more complicated than you think.

26
00:01:13,779 --> 00:01:16,154
But you called the police, right?

27
00:01:16,155 --> 00:01:19,218
Yeah, but they didn't even really get it
when I was explaining it to them.

28
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:23,018
It's very difficult to wrap your head
around unless you're a banker.

29
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:24,855
So explain it better.

30
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,250
Daddy, it's the right thing to do.

31
00:01:29,386 --> 00:01:32,269
Honey, can we please just change the subject?

32
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,310
Okay.

33
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,570
Can I get a cellphone?

34
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:39,651
Oh, yoi. I got no good choices here, do I?

35
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,890
I've got no good choices.

36
00:01:52,874 --> 00:01:53,924
Screw it.

37
00:02:01,475 --> 00:02:02,798
- Honey!
- Dad?

38
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,108
- I don't know what's going on!
- Dad!

39
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:08,819
- It's out of control,... !
- Dad, look out!

40
00:02:13,885 --> 00:02:15,775
- The brakes!
- Daddy!

41
00:02:40,178 --> 00:02:42,908
Okay, guys. Hold on. I got you.

42
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:46,947
Get her out of here. Now.

43
00:02:46,948 --> 00:02:49,638
Yeah, okay. I've got her.
Give me your hands. Move slow.

44
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,905
Move slow.

45
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,036
Take it easy.

46
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,145
Okay.

47
00:02:56,686 --> 00:03:00,116
- I got her. Get him.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

48
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:04,404
Help me. What... -

49
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:08,876
Help! Help me!

50
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:10,371
Help!

51
00:03:12,282 --> 00:03:14,446
- My dad? My dad?
- Help me!

52
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:16,547
- Okay. Hold on.
- Help.

53
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,718
Help!

54
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:25,891
Hurry!

55
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:30,491
Go! Go!

56
00:03:42,558 --> 00:03:45,502
The rich and powerful,
they take what they want.

57
00:03:45,503 --> 00:03:47,743
We steal it back for you.

58
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:55,725
And sometimes, bad guys
make the best good guys.

59
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,789
We provide...

60
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:01,752
leverage.

61
00:04:07,987 --> 00:04:10,329
Excuse me, I just wanted to check on... -

62
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,618
Hi, I'm Glenn Leary.
I'm Matt's boss at the bank.

63
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:17,596
I'm sorry. This is Lieutenant
Bonanno of the State Police.

64
00:04:17,597 --> 00:04:20,607
Mr. Ford. Hell of a thing you did.

65
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:23,351
Now, you call me if you think
of anything, all right?

66
00:04:23,352 --> 00:04:24,729
- Sure.
- State Police?

67
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,888
Car crash downtown - That's
Boston P.D., not State Police.

68
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:30,451
Well, you're right.

69
00:04:30,452 --> 00:04:31,648
It's not.

70
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:38,435
Matt called him to set up a
meeting. I have no idea why.

71
00:04:38,436 --> 00:04:39,853
Maybe something at the bank?

72
00:04:39,854 --> 00:04:43,502
How? There isn't even gonna
be a bank after friday.

73
00:04:43,503 --> 00:04:47,094
We work at First Boston Independent.
We're going under.

74
00:04:47,095 --> 00:04:48,689
At the end of the week,
the government's gonna come in,...

75
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,811
write one last check for all our bad assets,
and that's it - Close the doors.

76
00:04:52,812 --> 00:04:53,812
And...

77
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:56,871
Matt took it pretty hard.

78
00:04:56,872 --> 00:04:58,108
He's drinking.

79
00:04:58,109 --> 00:05:01,120
You know what a mess people
are when they drink.

80
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:03,801
He's in surgery. I'm gonna
go down and check on him.

81
00:05:03,802 --> 00:05:05,402
Thanks again.

82
00:05:07,303 --> 00:05:09,963
Something's wrong with the car.

83
00:05:11,703 --> 00:05:13,523
It went real fast,...

84
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,956
and then the brakes... -

85
00:05:15,957 --> 00:05:16,957
Yeah?

86
00:05:17,157 --> 00:05:20,699
Listen, there's a Detective Bonanno out there.
I'm gonna go tell him about this, okay?

87
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,800
No, wait!

88
00:05:22,998 --> 00:05:26,366
Something's wrong with the car.

89
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,722
Okay,...

90
00:05:31,515 --> 00:05:32,543
okay.

91
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,383
All right.

92
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:38,739
You should get some sleep.

93
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,423
Yeah?

94
00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:43,571
Yeah.

95
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:07,157
<i>- Picking up for one.
- Last name?</i>

96
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,257
<i>- Parker.
- First name?</i>

97
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:10,922
<i>No. Just one name.</i>

98
00:06:13,303 --> 00:06:15,683
Great. I hope you enjoy it.

99
00:06:17,273 --> 00:06:19,023
Parker?

100
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:28,101
All right. After the show,
then. I'll see you.

101
00:06:38,827 --> 00:06:40,363
- Eliot.
- Nate.

102
00:06:40,398 --> 00:06:42,837
- Parker.
- Hardison.

103
00:06:44,686 --> 00:06:46,745
- So, how have you... -
- Good. Good. Great. You?

104
00:06:46,746 --> 00:06:50,678
Fantastic. Six months of traveling.
Did a couple of big jobs.

105
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:55,272
Yeah. Me, too. Great off time. Well,
I bought an oxygen tank. Cool, nice.

106
00:06:55,273 --> 00:06:58,003
Yeah, super.
I've been really super, too.

107
00:06:58,004 --> 00:07:01,794
Yeah, she didn't tell me
that you guys would... -

108
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:03,615
Oh, you all made it.

109
00:07:04,261 --> 00:07:07,381
- I didn't know you could sing.
- You know.

110
00:07:07,382 --> 00:07:10,513
Not as well as I act, but, yeah.

111
00:07:10,548 --> 00:07:11,994
Thanks.

112
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:14,899
I don't want to wrinkle your... -

113
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,597
We're gonna meet up afterwards.

114
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:38,226
Yeah, you know, I'm sure
the reviews will be...

115
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:42,355
- on the news website already.
- Really? Wow.

116
00:07:43,423 --> 00:07:46,006
"Never before has a production
of 'The Sound Of Music'...

117
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,457
made me root for the nazis."

118
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:49,775
But...

119
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:54,630
- You quit drinking?
- Yep.

120
00:07:54,631 --> 00:07:56,428
- You quit drinking?
- Sure did.

121
00:07:56,429 --> 00:07:58,777
You quit drinking?

122
00:07:58,997 --> 00:08:00,590
How do you know about this place, then?

123
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:02,822
I rent a condo upstairs.

124
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,725
You rent a condo above a bar?

125
00:08:04,726 --> 00:08:05,989
That's right.

126
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:07,774
Well, that's very...

127
00:08:08,452 --> 00:08:10,011
Catholic.

128
00:08:10,046 --> 00:08:13,107
- The costumes were really great.
- No. No, no, no. Stop it.

129
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:16,020
There is nothing you can say
that's gonna make me feel better.

130
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:17,914
I know what could make you feel better.

131
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,840
We should steal something.

132
00:08:19,841 --> 00:08:21,311
- No, no.
- Yes!

133
00:08:21,332 --> 00:08:24,674
- We could do it together.
- I like this. Get right back up on the bike.

134
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:26,941
- Bike of crime.
- Didn't you earlier tell me how...

135
00:08:26,942 --> 00:08:28,626
great your new lives were?

136
00:08:28,627 --> 00:08:31,154
- Yeah, well, I stole the hope diamond.
- What?

137
00:08:31,155 --> 00:08:34,640
And then I put it back. Yeah,
'cause I was bored. Didn't care.

138
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:38,051
I spent three days hacking
the white house e-mail - No buzz.

139
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:39,462
- See?
- But we are doing...

140
00:08:39,463 --> 00:08:41,617
some pretty hinky stuff in Pakistan.

141
00:08:41,618 --> 00:08:43,162
- Hinky.
- Look,...

142
00:08:43,163 --> 00:08:45,717
I'm miserable. They're miserable.

143
00:08:45,718 --> 00:08:49,663
Okay, what have you been
doing the last six months?

144
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:52,152
I was in Pakistan.

145
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:57,087
You see what you did? You took
the world's best criminals... -

146
00:08:57,088 --> 00:09:00,956
Hitter, hacker, grifter, thief.
You took us, and you broke us.

147
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,096
No, no. I... - what I did, I taught you...

148
00:09:03,097 --> 00:09:05,078
- how to help people. That's all.
- Exactly.

149
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:08,263
- Yeah.
- This is the problem, with being the good guy.

150
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:09,834
It gets under your skin.

151
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:12,748
Look, Nate. You have to have
some poor, little lost soul...

152
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:15,307
somewhere who needs
a little extra-legal aid.

153
00:09:15,308 --> 00:09:17,494
Look, we all agreed that we'd just move on.

154
00:09:17,495 --> 00:09:19,617
Yeah, but we're... -

155
00:09:19,998 --> 00:09:22,220
- We're thieves.
- Not me.

156
00:09:22,221 --> 00:09:24,837
Look, it was great. It was fun.
It was wonderful while it lasted,...

157
00:09:24,838 --> 00:09:27,692
but I was drunk most of the time,
to be honest with you. And I...

158
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,367
- a little crazy.
- Yeah, but you were good.

159
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,007
- You were the best.
- We were the best.

160
00:09:31,008 --> 00:09:34,311
- Yeah.
- Listen, really, I owe all of you.

161
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:39,142
And I'm very proud of what
we did. I really am. But...

162
00:09:39,173 --> 00:09:43,050
I got my life back, and I
intend to keep it that way.

163
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:45,131
And I am not a thief.

164
00:09:46,005 --> 00:09:49,155
It was great to see all of you. Good night.

165
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:52,592
You didn't even get a chance to tell him.

166
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:53,593
I know.

167
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:55,356
Tell him what?

168
00:09:55,391 --> 00:09:56,538
Nothing.

169
00:10:19,463 --> 00:10:21,703
Hey, does your mother sew?

170
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:23,973
Stitch that.

171
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,609
Bugger.

172
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,127
That's my shirt.

173
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:02,128
Yeah.

174
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:05,550
- I stayed the night to make sure you were okay.
- You what?

175
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:07,453
But don't worry. I didn't...

176
00:11:07,454 --> 00:11:11,594
look under your bed. I know that's
where guys keep weird, kinky stuff.

177
00:11:11,595 --> 00:11:14,115
There's nothing under my bed.

178
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:17,814
- This is all coffee.
- Get out of there!

179
00:11:17,815 --> 00:11:19,495
What are you guys doing?

180
00:11:19,496 --> 00:11:21,030
Come on, get out of here.

181
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:24,321
Get all this stuff out of here. You're planning
something. I know it. Come on. Get out...

182
00:11:24,322 --> 00:11:26,892
- of my house.
- Someone tried to kill you last night.

183
00:11:26,893 --> 00:11:29,854
What do you want us to do, man? You want
us to just blow town and let you figure it out?

184
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,093
Yes, actually. That's exactly
what I want you to do.

185
00:11:32,094 --> 00:11:34,234
We found the phone number
of the hospital in your pocket,...

186
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,789
and we know what you did.

187
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,295
We know you saved that
guy's life and that little girl.

188
00:11:38,296 --> 00:11:40,585
And we're all really, really proud of you.

189
00:11:40,586 --> 00:11:43,547
Look, nobody else is gonna help
that guy and his little girl. Okay,...

190
00:11:43,548 --> 00:11:45,776
that's what we do.
We help people.

191
00:11:45,777 --> 00:11:48,552
By the way, I compared Sophie's
description of your attacker...

192
00:11:48,553 --> 00:11:52,683
to the accident footage
from the security camera.

193
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:54,532
Match found.

194
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:58,501
Do you realize, on average, people are
caught on security cameras 13 times a day?

195
00:11:58,502 --> 00:12:00,712
Atm cameras,
traffic cameras.

196
00:12:00,713 --> 00:12:04,843
It's crazy, man,
but we can track him. We can.

197
00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:09,320
- Well, I lost him in this.
- Yeah, well, I found...

198
00:12:09,321 --> 00:12:13,036
this empty briefcase belonging to a
Matt Kerrigan at that intersection.

199
00:12:13,037 --> 00:12:15,196
It's Boston Commonwealth Bank, right?

200
00:12:15,197 --> 00:12:20,867
No, First Independent Boston. That's
where Kerrigan works. Come on.

201
00:12:21,176 --> 00:12:22,697
Who's this guy?

202
00:12:24,195 --> 00:12:25,562
You don't know, do you?

203
00:12:25,563 --> 00:12:28,993
That's Kerrigan's boss, that guy. Leary.

204
00:12:31,007 --> 00:12:32,557
Whatever.

205
00:12:34,697 --> 00:12:35,774
All right, who's the other guy?

206
00:12:35,775 --> 00:12:38,265
It's not clear enough for facial recognition.

207
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:41,791
Yeah, well, the problem is, these two cats
went down to the safety deposit boxes.

208
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:44,673
Which is the only room in every
bank, with absolutely no cameras.

209
00:12:44,674 --> 00:12:46,163
Which means we up, baby.

210
00:12:46,164 --> 00:12:48,864
They tried to kill Kerrigan
for what was in the briefcase.

211
00:12:48,865 --> 00:12:50,207
We're gonna steal it back.

212
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,234
She was dressed that way
'cause she's doing a con.

213
00:12:52,235 --> 00:12:55,457
What, you thought she was dressed
like a nun for no reason?

214
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,908
It's Parker.

215
00:12:57,251 --> 00:12:58,916
Oh, fair enough.

216
00:12:58,951 --> 00:13:01,586
Okay, I want you out of my house. Out.

217
00:13:01,587 --> 00:13:02,609
I'm getting cleaned up.

218
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:05,881
I'm going upstairs. I want all this stuff
out of here. I want you guys out of here.

219
00:13:05,881 --> 00:13:07,579
I'm not a part of this.

220
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,900
- Okay.
- Not a part of this.

221
00:13:08,901 --> 00:13:10,538
This is you guys.

222
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:13,207
- We got it.
- If you want to do this thing,...

223
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,407
- you're on your own.
- All right.

224
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:15,414
Understood?

225
00:13:16,902 --> 00:13:18,162
So, you going?

226
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:22,077
I'm not going anywhere.
The man has 700 sports channels.

227
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:24,777
You want to see
what he's got under his bed?

228
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:26,083
No, I do not.

229
00:13:26,118 --> 00:13:27,275
Icky.

230
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:30,559
I personally promise...

231
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,589
your missionary money will be
absolutely safe here in our vault.

232
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,008
I thank you.

233
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,920
You keep your key. The master
remains upstairs at all times.

234
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,878
Oh, bless you, bless you, sweets. Bless you.

235
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:50,669
You are the twinkle in that song "Twinkle,
Twinkle, Little Star." Thank you much.

236
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,360
Oh, that is wrong.

237
00:13:53,074 --> 00:13:55,578
- Which box is Glenn Leary's?
- 5076,...

238
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:59,569
but you know you're gonna need the master key.

239
00:14:01,427 --> 00:14:04,782
And the children... - The children thank you.

240
00:14:04,783 --> 00:14:08,195
They will send you a card just as
soon as we buy them tiny pencils.

241
00:14:08,196 --> 00:14:13,110
And teach them how to spell.
It's a two-step process, you see.

242
00:14:13,111 --> 00:14:15,511
Superglue and a heat-
activated polymer to set it.

243
00:14:15,512 --> 00:14:18,452
Seven seconds,
instant plastic key.

244
00:14:19,186 --> 00:14:20,866
- Shake it.
- What?

245
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:22,455
Shake the bible.

246
00:14:23,923 --> 00:14:26,632
This is even more wrong.

247
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,880
I did look for you.

248
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:31,051
- For six months.
- Done.

249
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,025
The key. Done.

250
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,450
I think people are like locks.

251
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,826
Really complicated and frustrating.

252
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:48,399
But you can't force them.

253
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:51,605
You have to take time and be fiddly.

254
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,867
- Fiddly?
- You learn to be patient,...

255
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:58,126
and just wait until you hear the...

256
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:04,928
We could open every box
in here with that key.

257
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:07,838
- Focus.
- We could steal everything. Clean them out.

258
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,163
Focus.

259
00:15:09,332 --> 00:15:12,622
- I'm just saying.
- I'm just saying.

260
00:15:14,618 --> 00:15:19,458
All right, Zoe, well, that's,... - You know,
it'll be better once you get it out of the cast.

261
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:21,349
Yeah. How's your dad?

262
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:26,176
Oh. Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm gonna
come by later and check on you.

263
00:15:26,177 --> 00:15:27,980
Yeah. Take care.

264
00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:31,493
Now, this is not "gone."
This is "more."

265
00:15:31,494 --> 00:15:34,493
Yeah, I scanned the documents in Leary's box,...

266
00:15:34,494 --> 00:15:35,737
but I wanted to print out a few pages.

267
00:15:35,738 --> 00:15:39,493
I asked Eliot to get rid of this stuff.
Now there's more stuff.

268
00:15:39,494 --> 00:15:42,812
Did you? Oh, we crossed, but didn't
see each other. He didn't tell me.

269
00:15:42,813 --> 00:15:44,507
Oh, that's how you're gonna play this?

270
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:45,540
Oh, man.

271
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:47,023
Look...

272
00:15:48,868 --> 00:15:51,065
- What?
- Is that... - What is that aroma?

273
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:54,644
- That's that apple shampoo that's open.
- You've been up in my shower, rummaging around?

274
00:15:54,645 --> 00:15:57,770
Man's in a strange bathroom,
he's got a lot of time to kill... -

275
00:15:57,771 --> 00:15:59,731
Nate, Nate, Nate. Look.

276
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:02,768
- Business incorporated, 1978.
- Guess what. Don't care.

277
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:04,828
Look, look. This is what Kerrigan found.

278
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:07,437
The deeds from '75 to '77.

279
00:16:07,472 --> 00:16:10,130
20 businesses all started in the late '70s.

280
00:16:10,131 --> 00:16:12,376
Now, here's where it gets weird.

281
00:16:12,377 --> 00:16:14,940
All the financials for - what? - 30 years,...

282
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:18,452
squeaky clean. Taxes paid,
employees withholding often and early.

283
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:20,412
Until the last six months.

284
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,948
That's when they took out
crazy-bad business loans,...

285
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:25,466
refinanced mortgages
with high interest rates.

286
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:30,238
I'm talking big loans, too.
Add it up, it's a couple million.

287
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,569
Brandon O'Hare.

288
00:16:31,734 --> 00:16:33,507
I'll run him through the database.

289
00:16:33,508 --> 00:16:36,474
Grew up in the same neighborhood.
The O'Hares are mobbed up.

290
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:39,393
These are all mob businesses
you're talking about here.

291
00:16:39,394 --> 00:16:41,494
- Mob?
- Where's Eliot?

292
00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:42,851
Oops.

293
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,564
What?

294
00:16:49,005 --> 00:16:53,423
Yeah, Hardison. This is the third
place I checked. It's all the same.

295
00:16:53,424 --> 00:16:56,084
- What do you mean mob?
- Hey!

296
00:16:57,237 --> 00:16:58,368
Oh, that mob.

297
00:16:58,369 --> 00:17:00,981
- Hey, that's private property.
- Yeah.

298
00:17:00,982 --> 00:17:05,886
Don't yeah, I'm gonna teach you
how to respect private property.

299
00:17:05,887 --> 00:17:07,847
What did I tell you?

300
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:18,033
Ow! God! Not the nose! Oh!

301
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:22,834
Come on.

302
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:37,149
He kicked my nose!

303
00:17:41,177 --> 00:17:42,749
Oh, sorry.

304
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:49,669
Seriously?

305
00:17:52,102 --> 00:17:53,367
You know, guys,...

306
00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:55,110
there is a dishwasher here.

307
00:17:55,111 --> 00:17:59,003
You're out of ice. This is all the stuff
I found at the warehouse in the boxes.

308
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:01,559
Check it out: A 1981 calendar Hall And Oates.

309
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,199
The first two months
are all hall and no oates.

310
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,285
That's cold, man.

311
00:18:05,286 --> 00:18:07,899
Judging by this fringing and...

312
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,064
What? Those shoulder pads,...

313
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:15,171
this stuff hasn't left
that warehouse since the 1980s.

314
00:18:15,172 --> 00:18:17,697
I fell like a robot.

315
00:18:17,732 --> 00:18:21,536
Wait, so if these are supposed
to be just fake businesses,...

316
00:18:21,537 --> 00:18:24,121
how come their financials
are so squeaky clean?

317
00:18:24,122 --> 00:18:26,782
Because they're fake businesses.

318
00:18:26,795 --> 00:18:28,475
I mean, come on, it's right there.

319
00:18:28,476 --> 00:18:31,427
I mean, I'm just saying.

320
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:34,252
What?

321
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:36,833
Sophie, how do you catch mob guys?

322
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:40,397
Two glasses of chianti and a story
about my grandma in Sicily.

323
00:18:40,398 --> 00:18:42,384
How does the government catch mob guys?

324
00:18:42,385 --> 00:18:43,458
- Taxes.
- Taxes.

325
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:45,076
That's how they got Capone.

326
00:18:45,077 --> 00:18:47,548
It's how they get everybody. Yeah, I mean,
they never get you for the crime.

327
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:50,598
They always get you for
the taxes. It's not really fair.

328
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,905
So, 30 years ago,
the O'Hares got very smart.

329
00:18:52,906 --> 00:18:54,772
You see, they set up
all these shell companies.

330
00:18:54,773 --> 00:18:57,869
Fake sales, receipts. They launder
all their money through them.

331
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,486
Everybody in the family
gets a "salary."

332
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:04,375
Yeah, they pay withholding, payroll
taxes, pension. It's all old school.

333
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,624
That's why the businesses are clean.
They're dirty from the inside.

334
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:09,486
Well, yeah. I mean,...

335
00:19:09,487 --> 00:19:14,308
if you have a body in the trunk of your car, you're
gonna drive under the speed limit, aren't you?

336
00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:16,462
You know, when you're sober,
your metaphors get creepier.

337
00:19:16,463 --> 00:19:19,345
But, wait, wait, that still doesn't explain...

338
00:19:19,346 --> 00:19:23,880
- the last six months of running up bad loans.
- All from a bank that's about to close.

339
00:19:23,881 --> 00:19:28,167
Close? No, not close. Get bailed out.

340
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:30,403
Look, we've got a banker
in the pocket of the mob.

341
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:33,782
The mob takes out bad loans,
cleans out the bank...

342
00:19:33,783 --> 00:19:37,761
knowing three days from now, the
government's gonna come along and then,..

343
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:39,824
you know, bail the bank out.

344
00:19:39,825 --> 00:19:41,062
I mean,...

345
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:42,949
it's perfect.

346
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:46,550
You know, I don't even think it's illegal.

347
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:48,344
I mean, if we were gonna do this...

348
00:19:48,345 --> 00:19:50,724
- this job... -
- Just this one job.

349
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:53,280
- Yes, just this one.
- Yeah.

350
00:19:53,846 --> 00:19:56,926
- I mean, the con that you'd want to do... -
- Hypothetically.

351
00:19:56,927 --> 00:19:59,343
...hypothetically, you know,
is, the turnabout, of course.

352
00:19:59,344 --> 00:20:01,086
Oh, that is a good one.

353
00:20:01,087 --> 00:20:03,564
You know, it takes...

354
00:20:03,921 --> 00:20:06,675
- five people to do the turnabout.
- That's true.

355
00:20:06,676 --> 00:20:11,366
- There's just the four of us.
- Need one more person.

356
00:20:12,075 --> 00:20:17,111
We've got to scare the banker
into turning against the mob.

357
00:20:17,112 --> 00:20:18,313
All right.

358
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:21,558
All right, we'll do this job. Just...

359
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,643
this one.

360
00:20:22,678 --> 00:20:25,541
- If you really want.
- If you insist.

361
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:27,400
Great. We're on board.

362
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:30,552
Hardison, you and Parker,
you're gonna be on the badge.

363
00:20:30,553 --> 00:20:33,016
Eliot, sheepdog.

364
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:34,938
- Sophie...
- Ice queen.

365
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:38,517
And I'm the bagman. Now, if you'll excuse me,
I am gonna go call a professional killer...

366
00:20:38,518 --> 00:20:44,261
who tried to murder me, and arrange
to meet him in an isolated location.

367
00:20:44,262 --> 00:20:45,902
Well played.

368
00:20:46,761 --> 00:20:48,006
See that?

369
00:20:48,493 --> 00:20:50,427
He did miss us.

370
00:20:55,932 --> 00:20:58,870
Mr. Leary, I'm Detective Costello,
with the Massachusetts State Police.

371
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:00,659
This is Detective Costigan.

372
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,912
I believe you met with
our chief, Lieutenant Bonanno.

373
00:21:02,913 --> 00:21:04,412
Yeah. How can I help you?

374
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:07,178
We're investigating your
colleague Matt Kerrigan's...

375
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:08,399
"car accident."

376
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,378
So you don't think it was an accident?

377
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:14,120
Of course not. She did the finger thing.
You got that. Everybody gets that.

378
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:18,251
- Did I do it right?
- No. No. This guy just...

379
00:21:19,813 --> 00:21:21,432
Do you recognize this man?

380
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:23,885
No, listen, I don't know what kind
of stuff Matt was getting into.

381
00:21:23,886 --> 00:21:25,798
You sure? Never went to the movies?

382
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,868
- I don't really know.
- Never went shopping together?

383
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:28,928
No, I didn't... -

384
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:30,383
Never went to your house.
Never did parties.

385
00:21:30,384 --> 00:21:32,382
Spend time with your family,
Christmas, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah?

386
00:21:32,383 --> 00:21:34,012
- No, didn't know him that well.
- You sure?

387
00:21:34,013 --> 00:21:36,800
Went to the pool, played a little pool,
knocking each other's balls around?

388
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:38,091
- Not really, no.
- All right, okay,...

389
00:21:38,092 --> 00:21:41,070
you know what, Mr. Leary,
if you think of anything,...

390
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:42,821
you give us a call.

391
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:44,867
We've got our eyes on you.

392
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:46,408
All right, thanks.

393
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:49,018
- I did it right, didn't I?
- It was perfect.

394
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:50,828
- I knew I did it right.
- It was beautiful execution.

395
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:52,370
- Absolutely.
- Just like you taught me. I did it.

396
00:21:52,371 --> 00:21:55,871
Yeah. Yeah, you did it. I like it. Yeah.

397
00:21:57,881 --> 00:22:01,185
Hey, this detonator - If I'm around
the corner, is it still gonna be in range?

398
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,809
Should be. I haven't worked
out all the kinks yet.

399
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,767
Sometimes the things just go off.

400
00:22:05,768 --> 00:22:07,658
Whoa, whoa, wait. Hey.

401
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,133
I thought you said this thing was safe.

402
00:22:10,134 --> 00:22:13,229
Mostly. Mostly safe. I was very specific.

403
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,319
Sometimes the frequencies get messed up.

404
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,231
What frequencies, man? Huh?
I got these things in my pants.

405
00:22:18,232 --> 00:22:22,572
Like, you know, a garage-door
opener, a car alarm.

406
00:22:26,499 --> 00:22:29,475
What are the odds that Eliot's
crotch will actually explode?

407
00:22:29,476 --> 00:22:31,101
Damn it, Hardison!

408
00:22:32,721 --> 00:22:33,920
Sophie.

409
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:39,275
Leary's tipped, and the street's
are mined. How's Nate doing?

410
00:22:41,331 --> 00:22:44,761
Let me call you back.
I've got to go.

411
00:22:52,092 --> 00:22:53,895
Why were you at the accident?

412
00:22:53,896 --> 00:22:55,724
I was following Kerrigan.

413
00:22:55,725 --> 00:22:57,835
- I thought he was one of your guys.
- You working for the cops?

414
00:22:57,836 --> 00:23:00,736
Sure, O'Hare, I'm working for the cops.
That's why I called you...

415
00:23:00,737 --> 00:23:02,469
and came down here alone...

416
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:05,482
because I'm the smartest under-
cover cop in the world. Come on.

417
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:07,509
You're Jimmy Ford's kid, Nathan.

418
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,185
Thought you were gonna become a priest.

419
00:23:09,186 --> 00:23:10,977
- Yeah, it didn't work out.
- I got news for you.

420
00:23:10,978 --> 00:23:13,579
Doesn't look like this is gonna
work out for you, either.

421
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,630
Go ahead. Entertain me.

422
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:17,833
Yeah, so, 30 years ago,...

423
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:20,657
your father set up a bunch of fake
businesses to launder your money.

424
00:23:20,658 --> 00:23:23,317
And you ran them through a bank
you guys control. How am I doing?

425
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,087
You're talking yourself
into Boston harbor.

426
00:23:25,088 --> 00:23:28,766
Yeah, then your bank got in a little trouble.
A big federal bailout comes along.

427
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:30,723
You figured out how to get
a slice of the bailout.

428
00:23:30,724 --> 00:23:32,575
Yeah, we're done here.

429
00:23:32,576 --> 00:23:35,399
You take out millions of dollars in bad loans,...

430
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,927
you get your pet banker Leary
to write you off as toxic assets...

431
00:23:38,928 --> 00:23:42,184
just as the banks go under.
Government eats the loans.

432
00:23:42,185 --> 00:23:48,065
You don't have to shell out a
single penny. Nice. I like it a lot.

433
00:23:49,147 --> 00:23:50,764
Annie Kroy.

434
00:23:54,514 --> 00:23:55,696
Name's familiar.

435
00:23:55,697 --> 00:23:58,509
My family does business in
North London with Terry Adams,...

436
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:01,017
and a couple of other organizations.

437
00:24:01,018 --> 00:24:02,270
We handle the money.

438
00:24:02,271 --> 00:24:04,427
Yeah, see, what they do
is they clean the money.

439
00:24:04,428 --> 00:24:05,428
Hey!

440
00:24:06,467 --> 00:24:08,751
- I wasn't talking to you.
- Yeah, all right.

441
00:24:08,752 --> 00:24:10,961
But since the new european banking laws...-

442
00:24:10,962 --> 00:24:12,596
You know this,
what are they calling it?

443
00:24:12,597 --> 00:24:14,717
The credit crunch. Yeah.

444
00:24:15,268 --> 00:24:19,638
Shifting money on either side of
the channel, it's getting a bit tricky.

445
00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:23,411
We hired him to find us alternatives
here in the states. And...

446
00:24:23,412 --> 00:24:24,900
he found you.

447
00:24:26,811 --> 00:24:28,010
Hello, gorgeous.

448
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:30,442
I was just coming up to talk
to him about it the other night...

449
00:24:30,443 --> 00:24:32,682
when your man here... -

450
00:24:32,717 --> 00:24:34,397
What would you say?

451
00:24:34,756 --> 00:24:36,556
We bumped heads.

452
00:24:36,607 --> 00:24:37,908
So,...

453
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,087
- what's your offer?
- We want in.

454
00:24:40,088 --> 00:24:42,945
We'll buy 30% of your businesses
at a five-point premium,...

455
00:24:42,946 --> 00:24:44,376
assume their debts.

456
00:24:44,377 --> 00:24:47,273
You trade us clean U.S. Government money...

457
00:24:47,274 --> 00:24:48,924
for our...

458
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:52,779
more soiled funds.

459
00:24:53,178 --> 00:24:56,305
- The bailout goes down in three days.
- All right then.

460
00:24:56,306 --> 00:25:01,836
Good faith payment, tomorrow, cash.
250 grand. Show we're serious.

461
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:08,341
- I'm gonna have to talk to some people.
- Fine.

462
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:13,242
It's up to you if you want to
tell them about the 250.

463
00:25:42,438 --> 00:25:44,499
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

464
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,335
Detective Costello.
Somebody just shot at me.

465
00:25:47,336 --> 00:25:49,436
We have to talk, please!

466
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,340
Nervous habit.

467
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:56,137
What is that?

468
00:25:56,829 --> 00:25:58,141
Saint Brigid.

469
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,650
My mother's name.

470
00:26:01,118 --> 00:26:04,058
Dad got it for me after she died.

471
00:26:07,129 --> 00:26:09,089
So, how are you doing?

472
00:26:09,365 --> 00:26:11,359
They say the accident's his fault.

473
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,625
No.

474
00:26:13,387 --> 00:26:15,016
No, now listen.

475
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:17,452
Your dad - He found some papers at work,...

476
00:26:17,453 --> 00:26:19,339
and he was trying to
figure out what they meant.

477
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,097
And he got a little bit
too close to something... -

478
00:26:21,098 --> 00:26:23,511
No, but it's not his fault. It was my fault.

479
00:26:23,512 --> 00:26:24,765
No, no, it wasn't your... -

480
00:26:24,766 --> 00:26:26,554
No, he said something
was bothering him at work.

481
00:26:26,555 --> 00:26:28,431
I told him to call the police, and now... -

482
00:26:28,432 --> 00:26:29,922
Now they...

483
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,575
"There are wolves in the world."

484
00:26:39,634 --> 00:26:41,524
That's what dad says.

485
00:26:41,885 --> 00:26:43,425
"Be careful, Zoe."

486
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:47,232
"There are wolves in the world."

487
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:51,101
He was not wrong.

488
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:53,047
Yeah?

489
00:26:59,541 --> 00:27:02,067
So the world's just like this, huh?

490
00:27:02,068 --> 00:27:04,736
Bad people do bad things and...

491
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:07,711
they always get away with it.

492
00:27:08,776 --> 00:27:10,776
Nobody stops them.

493
00:27:22,135 --> 00:27:23,643
New earbuds.

494
00:27:24,073 --> 00:27:26,499
Better range, better fits.

495
00:27:26,914 --> 00:27:30,011
All you'll have to do is whisper,
and we'll all hear it.

496
00:27:30,012 --> 00:27:33,173
Okay, now, if this works, our friend
Mr. Leary, he goes to the State Police,...

497
00:27:33,174 --> 00:27:35,413
he runs, he spills his guts.

498
00:27:35,414 --> 00:27:36,843
Eliot, make sure he gets there.

499
00:27:36,844 --> 00:27:38,298
I'm on it.

500
00:27:38,683 --> 00:27:39,837
Okay.

501
00:27:39,988 --> 00:27:43,208
And O'Hare's money for the frame-up?

502
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:49,664
And this money came from...

503
00:27:49,665 --> 00:27:50,938
Oh, yeah.

504
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:52,972
Perfect.

505
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,782
Okay,...

506
00:27:54,977 --> 00:27:56,927
let's reel them in.

507
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:04,952
<i>- Yeah, O'Hare?
- Ford, when are you gonna get here?</i>

508
00:28:08,623 --> 00:28:10,072
Oh, Detective, thank God.

509
00:28:10,073 --> 00:28:12,130
Listen, somebody tried to kill me yesterday.

510
00:28:12,131 --> 00:28:14,421
Yeah, I'll be there pretty soon.

511
00:28:14,422 --> 00:28:17,064
But listen, Mrs. Kroy,
she wants to talk to your banker...

512
00:28:17,065 --> 00:28:19,964
- and make sure the details are right.
- That's not gonna happen.

513
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:21,651
<i>Come in and talk to us, Mr. Leary.</i>

514
00:28:21,652 --> 00:28:24,161
We can protect you, but only
if you tell us everything.

515
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:26,337
I can't. I can't. Do you know
who's doing this to me?

516
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:28,035
<i>No, but I have to warn you.</i>

517
00:28:28,036 --> 00:28:30,587
<i>They're gonna try again.
And next time, they'll be smarter.</i>

518
00:28:30,588 --> 00:28:32,941
You know, she can be a real hard-ass.

519
00:28:32,942 --> 00:28:35,094
I mean, you saw that
the other night.

520
00:28:35,095 --> 00:28:38,805
Yeah, she got a hard head. Now, that ass...

521
00:28:38,996 --> 00:28:41,342
<i>Next time, you'll get a phone
call from somebody you know.</i>

522
00:28:41,343 --> 00:28:43,431
<i>They'll ask to meet you somewhere isolated,...</i>

523
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:45,722
- and that's the hit.
- Somebody I know?

524
00:28:45,723 --> 00:28:47,413
<i>And make sure the banker's there.</i>

525
00:28:47,414 --> 00:28:50,916
- I'll take care of it. Just bring the money.
- All right.

526
00:28:50,917 --> 00:28:54,543
When you get that call, come to my office.
You ask for Lieutenant Bonanno.

527
00:28:54,544 --> 00:28:55,861
You tell him everything.

528
00:28:55,862 --> 00:29:00,762
<i>- That's the only way I can keep you alive.
- But I... -</i>

529
00:29:07,042 --> 00:29:08,638
<i>- Hello?
- Leary, get down to the warehouse.</i>

530
00:29:08,639 --> 00:29:10,739
I need to meet you now.

531
00:29:23,363 --> 00:29:24,655
Where's your boss?

532
00:29:24,656 --> 00:29:28,200
She's on her way. I just wanted to
make sure it was just us, no cops.

533
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:29,581
Here you go.

534
00:29:32,024 --> 00:29:37,133
Eliot, is Leary with the cops?
We don't have a lot of room for error.

535
00:29:37,134 --> 00:29:38,744
There's a problem.

536
00:29:38,795 --> 00:29:42,223
Leary drove down to the
waterfront. Dumped his car.

537
00:29:42,224 --> 00:29:43,651
He's heading right for you.

538
00:29:43,652 --> 00:29:46,253
<i>He was supposed to go to the cops.</i>

539
00:29:46,254 --> 00:29:49,851
Well, then, I don't know what he's doing.

540
00:29:49,852 --> 00:29:51,474
O'Hare.

541
00:29:52,482 --> 00:29:53,924
O'Hare!

542
00:29:55,004 --> 00:29:56,464
What the hell are you thinking?

543
00:29:56,465 --> 00:29:59,483
- The deal, the brits, they wanted to meet.
- Somebody just took a shot at me.

544
00:29:59,484 --> 00:30:01,253
For all we know, it was the brits.

545
00:30:01,254 --> 00:30:03,528
And then you call me on my cellphone
when we're crawling with cops?

546
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:06,049
Okay, guys, it's not O'Hare.

547
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,833
<i>- What?
- Well, no.</i>

548
00:30:07,834 --> 00:30:10,557
O'Hare is not the boss is what I'm saying.

549
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,268
No. This whole con was built around O'Hare.

550
00:30:15,155 --> 00:30:18,112
They're probably gonna
shoot Nate in the face.

551
00:30:18,113 --> 00:30:20,143
Parker, I can hear you.

552
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:23,094
Sorry. Forgot about the... -

553
00:30:23,095 --> 00:30:25,019
This is not good.

554
00:30:25,054 --> 00:30:27,131
All right. Well, listen. We're gonna
have to make this one up as we go.

555
00:30:27,132 --> 00:30:29,221
State cops, they questioned me about Kerrigan.

556
00:30:29,222 --> 00:30:31,321
I tried to get them to talk, but nothing.

557
00:30:31,322 --> 00:30:34,682
Are you sure this deal isn't a setup?

558
00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:37,509
- Ford!
- Ah, yes.

559
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,551
You?

560
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,273
Him? This is the guy making the offer?

561
00:30:41,274 --> 00:30:43,943
- He was at the crash.
- Yeah, look, look. I'm just...

562
00:30:43,944 --> 00:30:46,782
- the middleman here. I mean,...
- I don't care why you're here.

563
00:30:46,783 --> 00:30:48,072
This stinks.

564
00:30:48,107 --> 00:30:50,523
- I say put him in the harbor.
- This is a good deal.

565
00:30:50,524 --> 00:30:52,259
You don't decide what deals we take.

566
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,980
And I say if you want your payoff,
you put him down now.

567
00:30:54,981 --> 00:30:57,344
A good faith payment right here.

568
00:30:57,345 --> 00:30:59,822
Sorry. We should have contacted you first,...

569
00:30:59,823 --> 00:31:04,452
but this was supposed to go
to the man in charge, so...

570
00:31:04,453 --> 00:31:06,447
You thought these guys
came up with that bailout plan?

571
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,932
- Yeah, yeah. Well, sure.
- Oh, come on.

572
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:11,682
These guys aren't in charge. I'm in charge.

573
00:31:11,683 --> 00:31:13,792
These guys have been running
this town for 30 years... -

574
00:31:13,793 --> 00:31:16,062
Oh, come on. These guys are the past.

575
00:31:16,063 --> 00:31:18,243
What do you think these guys clear in a year?

576
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:20,432
Stealing cigarettes, selling drugs... -

577
00:31:20,433 --> 00:31:22,031
A couple hundred thousand, all in?

578
00:31:22,032 --> 00:31:25,473
And for that, the government
hunts them down like dogs.

579
00:31:25,474 --> 00:31:27,206
People like me,...

580
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:30,282
we took billions from the banks.

581
00:31:30,283 --> 00:31:31,431
Billions.

582
00:31:31,573 --> 00:31:34,891
And what did the government do
when they finally caught us?

583
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:37,143
They wrote us a giant check,...

584
00:31:37,144 --> 00:31:40,294
and begged us to make it all better.

585
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,896
All right!

586
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:48,754
Hey, I know this guy.

587
00:31:48,764 --> 00:31:51,424
He was there when the cops questioned me.

588
00:31:51,425 --> 00:31:53,323
- Him?
- Yeah.

589
00:31:57,418 --> 00:32:00,358
You better know what you're doing.

590
00:32:02,281 --> 00:32:05,053
Hey, he's got a State Trooper badge.

591
00:32:05,054 --> 00:32:06,504
Son of a...

592
00:32:07,863 --> 00:32:09,055
That's it.

593
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,102
Kill him.

594
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,913
You want him dead, you kill him.

595
00:32:17,914 --> 00:32:19,881
I fixed Kerrigan's brakes.
I'm not killing a cop.

596
00:32:19,882 --> 00:32:21,357
You screwed up Kerrigan.

597
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:26,748
Yeah, no. He's right. You're right.
He's... - well, we're... -

598
00:32:42,187 --> 00:32:43,381
Has he got a wire?

599
00:32:43,382 --> 00:32:45,992
Well, come on, Ford. Get with it,
check him for a wire.

600
00:32:45,993 --> 00:32:48,146
Yes, right on it.

601
00:32:48,569 --> 00:32:50,023
This isn't how we do it in Boston.

602
00:32:50,024 --> 00:32:52,524
Really? It's exactly how we do it in London.

603
00:32:52,525 --> 00:32:55,975
Except we usually use a razor blade.

604
00:32:56,365 --> 00:32:58,099
No wire.

605
00:32:59,537 --> 00:33:01,926
But he has a cellphone, though.

606
00:33:01,927 --> 00:33:03,537
Give it to me.

607
00:33:05,412 --> 00:33:07,536
Ah, nothing on speed dial.

608
00:33:07,537 --> 00:33:08,990
Hit redial.

609
00:33:09,025 --> 00:33:10,673
See who he called.

610
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:12,248
Say, that's good.

611
00:33:12,437 --> 00:33:13,806
Leary, right?

612
00:33:13,841 --> 00:33:15,291
Annie Kroy.

613
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:18,196
Nice little number with the banks there.

614
00:33:18,197 --> 00:33:23,447
It's a shame the rest of your
operation's a bit ballsed-up.

615
00:33:29,249 --> 00:33:30,730
O'Hare?

616
00:33:30,765 --> 00:33:34,265
Why was a cop's last phone call to you?

617
00:33:39,265 --> 00:33:40,515
<i>Yeah, O'Hare?</i>

618
00:33:45,374 --> 00:33:48,034
<i>But he has a cellphone, though.</i>

619
00:33:48,155 --> 00:33:50,140
This is a setup.

620
00:33:50,175 --> 00:33:52,252
How is it a setup? She shot the cop.

621
00:33:52,253 --> 00:33:55,945
Yeah, and he's the one
who dialed the phone.

622
00:33:55,946 --> 00:33:58,179
You didn't want us
to shoot him either, did you?

623
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,715
Why? Did you know him?

624
00:33:59,716 --> 00:34:03,460
It wasn't like that! Come on! You know
I was in this thing right from the beginning.

625
00:34:03,461 --> 00:34:06,399
Why would I be involved?

626
00:34:06,774 --> 00:34:08,492
Go!

627
00:34:13,304 --> 00:34:16,761
- Get in if you want to live!
- There he is! Get him!

628
00:34:16,762 --> 00:34:18,439
Hey!

629
00:34:23,024 --> 00:34:24,149
Get him!

630
00:34:26,789 --> 00:34:28,389
Get the car!

631
00:34:32,383 --> 00:34:34,402
What are you doing? They're
gonna be right behind us.

632
00:34:34,403 --> 00:34:36,543
Then you best talk fast. State Police.

633
00:34:36,544 --> 00:34:38,351
What happened to our man?

634
00:34:38,352 --> 00:34:40,872
I didn't kill him. They did.

635
00:34:41,035 --> 00:34:42,371
Tactical's moving in now.

636
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,740
So in about one minute your friends
are gonna have swat teams,...

637
00:34:44,741 --> 00:34:47,074
smoke bombs, helicopters,
and lasers all up in there,...

638
00:34:47,075 --> 00:34:49,939
which means you got about
30 seconds to cut a deal, O'Hare.

639
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,431
That is who you are, right?
Brandon O'Hare?

640
00:34:53,432 --> 00:34:55,834
Oh, god. I'll give you leary. All right?

641
00:34:55,835 --> 00:34:59,006
He organized the bank fraud,
and he contracted the Kerrigan hit.

642
00:34:59,007 --> 00:35:01,947
I was an accessory after the fact.

643
00:35:02,387 --> 00:35:03,937
Good enough.

644
00:35:08,528 --> 00:35:12,387
<i>He organized the bank fraud,
and he contracted the Kerrigan hit.</i>

645
00:35:12,388 --> 00:35:14,235
Those were the state cops
who questioned me.

646
00:35:14,236 --> 00:35:16,267
Well, have they got any evidence?

647
00:35:16,268 --> 00:35:18,501
No, no. Nothing real.
Just O'Hare's word against mine.

648
00:35:18,502 --> 00:35:19,735
And no documents?

649
00:35:19,736 --> 00:35:21,976
No. No, no. I have those.

650
00:35:22,155 --> 00:35:23,376
But Kerrigan saw them.

651
00:35:23,377 --> 00:35:28,231
And there's just one problem.
We're screwed if he wakes up.

652
00:35:28,232 --> 00:35:29,482
He won't.

653
00:35:30,249 --> 00:35:32,157
Kerrigan's the last loose end.

654
00:35:32,158 --> 00:35:33,642
I'll take care of him myself.

655
00:35:33,643 --> 00:35:36,622
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, wait.
What about him?

656
00:35:36,623 --> 00:35:37,623
Him?

657
00:35:38,373 --> 00:35:39,923
Hey, I never touched him.

658
00:35:39,924 --> 00:35:41,876
Your fingerprints are all over him.

659
00:35:41,877 --> 00:35:45,657
I'll clean up my mess,
you clean up yours.

660
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,590
So, how did you do it?

661
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,732
Detonator...

662
00:35:55,623 --> 00:35:58,357
- Ketchup.
- Ah, the classics.

663
00:35:59,427 --> 00:36:02,146
Oh, I love a good death scene!

664
00:36:06,746 --> 00:36:08,986
<i>Dr. Lawrence to Pediatrics.</i>

665
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,650
Mr. Leary.

666
00:36:28,685 --> 00:36:30,153
You remember me, don't you?

667
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:34,424
Lieutenant Patrick Bonanno,
Organized Crime Division.

668
00:36:34,837 --> 00:36:36,528
Yeah. Of course I do.

669
00:36:36,529 --> 00:36:38,199
What's in the briefcase?

670
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,368
In...?

671
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,548
I can explain that.

672
00:36:49,196 --> 00:36:53,133
You know, I think I can explain
this, too. O'Hare's been talking.

673
00:36:53,134 --> 00:36:54,168
- O'Hare?
- Yeah.

674
00:36:54,169 --> 00:36:56,590
I just found him duct-taped
to the wheel of my car...

675
00:36:56,591 --> 00:36:58,668
with a taped confession
in his front pocket.

676
00:36:58,669 --> 00:37:00,670
He's being very cooperative.

677
00:37:00,671 --> 00:37:02,199
So, what?

678
00:37:02,234 --> 00:37:03,889
You find out O'Hhare flipped,...

679
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:08,637
and you went and robbed your
own bank for getaway money?

680
00:37:08,638 --> 00:37:09,766
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

681
00:37:09,767 --> 00:37:14,199
Somebody cleared out several
safe deposit boxes at your bank.

682
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,260
<i>We could open every box
in here with that key.</i>

683
00:37:24,682 --> 00:37:26,152
Oh, what's this?

684
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,886
I'm gonna take a closer look at these, too.

685
00:37:29,887 --> 00:37:31,431
You know, maybe they can explain...

686
00:37:31,432 --> 00:37:33,019
why you tried to kill Mr. Kerrigan.

687
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,234
Hey! No, I had nothing
to do with that car crash!

688
00:37:36,235 --> 00:37:38,435
I was nowhere near there.

689
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,469
Well, why don't you just explain
one thing to me, then.

690
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,082
What are you doing...

691
00:37:43,083 --> 00:37:45,813
with Kerrigan's stolen briefcase?

692
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:48,543
<i>Oh, yeah. Yeah.</i>

693
00:37:51,943 --> 00:37:53,593
<i>Well, I found...</i>

694
00:37:53,649 --> 00:37:56,201
<i>this empty briefcase
belonging to Matt Kerrigan...</i>

695
00:37:56,202 --> 00:37:57,952
<i>at that intersection.</i>

696
00:38:02,331 --> 00:38:03,629
I was tricked.

697
00:38:03,664 --> 00:38:06,040
I was tricked. It wasn't me, you understand?

698
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:07,237
Somebody tricked you...

699
00:38:07,238 --> 00:38:11,517
into bringing a briefcase full of evidence
of your own crimes straight to the police?

700
00:38:11,518 --> 00:38:13,085
Come on, Mr. Leary.

701
00:38:13,086 --> 00:38:14,886
Nobody's that smart.

702
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:17,746
Get him out of here.

703
00:38:25,988 --> 00:38:27,295
I can't take this from you.

704
00:38:27,296 --> 00:38:29,048
Well, you know, it's not from us.

705
00:38:29,049 --> 00:38:32,729
The IRS pays a percentage
for all the tax frauds reported.

706
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:36,218
All those mob businesses,
30 years of back taxes.

707
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:38,019
You found them.

708
00:38:39,936 --> 00:38:40,945
Thank you.

709
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,500
I can never thank you enough.

710
00:38:58,344 --> 00:38:59,344
Thank you.

711
00:39:00,953 --> 00:39:03,543
There are wolves in the world.

712
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,660
But sometimes they're the good guys, I guess.

713
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:27,925
Still your last job?

714
00:39:28,317 --> 00:39:30,550
Well, maybe,... -

715
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:32,433
Yeah?

716
00:39:32,543 --> 00:39:34,940
I mean, you know, until I find
a job I like enough, you know,...

717
00:39:34,941 --> 00:39:36,433
to stay out of the bars.

718
00:39:36,434 --> 00:39:38,177
Idle hands are the devil's workshop.

719
00:39:38,178 --> 00:39:39,602
And then I'm out. I'm done.

720
00:39:39,603 --> 00:39:41,053
- Yeah.
- Sure.

721
00:39:41,896 --> 00:39:44,206
'Cause you're not a thief.

722
00:39:47,856 --> 00:39:51,056
Hey, let's go get some dinner.

723
00:39:52,073 --> 00:39:53,216
Yeah, I...

724
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:55,611
I can't. I...

725
00:39:56,330 --> 00:40:00,740
- I got to go meet someone.
- Ah, bring them along.

726
00:40:04,725 --> 00:40:06,079
Boyfriend.

727
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:12,619
Yeah.

728
00:40:13,899 --> 00:40:16,503
- He's really...
- Yeah, I get it.

729
00:40:16,504 --> 00:40:18,507
You'll meet him.

730
00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:20,924
- But...
- Go, go.

731
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,358
See ya.

732
00:40:43,053 --> 00:40:45,083
Give me an Irish, neat.

733
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:38,997
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing there?

734
00:41:38,998 --> 00:41:41,955
- I'm running this cat 5 cable to the... -
- Oh, no, no, no, no. You don't understand.

735
00:41:41,956 --> 00:41:44,350
No, I don't want to have these
monitors in my apartment. No.

736
00:41:44,351 --> 00:41:46,290
- Coming through!
- No, these must go. What?

737
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:49,076
No! Parker, no! Not that paint... -
I don't ever want to see that painting.

738
00:41:49,077 --> 00:41:51,920
"Hi, I'm old nate, and I live here, too."

739
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:54,214
You can't just break in here
and start hanging... -

740
00:41:54,215 --> 00:41:55,935
Oh, yeah, yeah. For repairs or renovation,...

741
00:41:55,936 --> 00:41:58,313
your landlord has full access to
your dwelling. It's in the lease.

742
00:41:58,314 --> 00:41:59,875
What are you doing reading my lease?

743
00:41:59,876 --> 00:42:01,766
I bought the building.

744
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:04,114
You bought the...

745
00:42:04,115 --> 00:42:05,362
You're my landlord?

746
00:42:05,363 --> 00:42:06,363
Yeah.

747
00:42:07,769 --> 00:42:08,929
Yeah.

748
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:18,091
No!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
