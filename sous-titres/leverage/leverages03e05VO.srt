1
00:00:03,143 --> 00:00:05,966
I can't believe you actually
bought this dreadful red thing.

2
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:07,882
I believe it's called a sweater.

3
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:11,241
This monstrosity defies the good name
of sweaters everywhere.

4
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:14,457
Lisa, I was kidding,
the sweater is fine.

5
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:16,307
I just need to rest for a second.

6
00:00:26,196 --> 00:00:27,196
Somebody!

7
00:00:29,934 --> 00:00:31,062
Help!

8
00:00:43,116 --> 00:00:44,116
Ashley?

9
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,896
- Ashley Moore, right?
- You must be Dr. Roberts.

10
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:51,092
Yes, sorry I was
so cryptic on the phone.

11
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:54,197
I have some information

12
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:56,122
about your sister's death.

13
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,471
What? Did you know Lisa?

14
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:03,729
No, but I know about the drug trial
she was part of.

15
00:01:04,124 --> 00:01:05,558
I'm so sorry.

16
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,768
Were you involved in the trial?

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,320
I'm sorry. I should see who this is.

18
00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:13,239
- Of course.
- Hello?

19
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:15,422
Hello?

20
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,613
Who is this? I can't hear you.

21
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,076
Are you okay?

22
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:09,864
FBI, sir.
That young lady's in our custody.

23
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:13,456
See, you made two mistakes, bro.

24
00:02:13,922 --> 00:02:17,280
First, you flashed
that fake-ass FBI badge at me.

25
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:18,763
Second...

26
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:21,266
You spilled his coffee.

27
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,639
See, I got your back.

28
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,571
The rich and powerful
take what they want.

29
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,405
We steal it back for you.

30
00:02:43,494 --> 00:02:47,333
Sometimes, bad guys
make the best good guys.

31
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,284
We provide leverage!

32
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,839
Season 3 Episode 5
<i>The Double-Blind Job</i>

33
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:57,551
My sister was part of a drug trial
for a new medication called HT1.

34
00:02:58,175 --> 00:03:01,412
A week into the trial, she suffered
acute liver failure and died.

35
00:03:01,537 --> 00:03:03,516
Did the drug company
offer a settlement?

36
00:03:04,282 --> 00:03:07,327
JRP Pharmaceuticals,
the company sponsoring the trial...

37
00:03:08,112 --> 00:03:10,773
They sent a very attractive man
in a suit to our house.

38
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,527
He said nobody else had any side effects
and it was a freak accident.

39
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:18,030
He sat at our kitchen table,
he wrote a number on a piece of paper.

40
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,783
Sitting at the table
where she used to eat pancakes...

41
00:03:24,722 --> 00:03:25,722
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:27,619 --> 00:03:31,281
So, your parents declined
any kind of settlement?

43
00:03:32,523 --> 00:03:34,077
I convinced them not to.

44
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:37,378
I gave them a great speech about
how Lisa's life couldn't be bought,

45
00:03:37,503 --> 00:03:40,427
how I'd make the people
who killed her take responsibility.

46
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,971
Yeah, but that never happened.

47
00:03:43,124 --> 00:03:44,807
Sounds like you've been there.

48
00:03:45,584 --> 00:03:46,734
Close enough.

49
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:51,958
We sued, but JRP claimed
Lisa had a pre-existing condition.

50
00:03:52,248 --> 00:03:53,106
We lost.

51
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:55,471
Causation is the hardest thing
to prove in these cases.

52
00:03:55,596 --> 00:03:58,053
We couldn't find a lawyer
who would take our appeal.

53
00:03:58,647 --> 00:04:02,096
I've spent three years
looking for any new evidence.

54
00:04:02,397 --> 00:04:05,223
I found nothing
until Dr. Roberts contacted me.

55
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,416
- And now he's gone.
- We'll find him.

56
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,208
We're happy that you're okay.

57
00:04:11,532 --> 00:04:12,782
Thanks to Alec.

58
00:04:13,147 --> 00:04:15,796
I don't know what would have happened
if he hadn't been there.

59
00:04:16,619 --> 00:04:19,606
Now, before Dr. Roberts disappeared,

60
00:04:19,731 --> 00:04:22,928
did he leave you anything,
give you any information, some...

61
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:24,692
Just this.

62
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,185
"Arcadia" and a bunch of names.
I don't know.

63
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,353
Here.

64
00:04:33,435 --> 00:04:35,858
Arcadia's a town
about 30 miles from here.

65
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,501
But I got nothing on the names.

66
00:04:38,626 --> 00:04:41,928
- None of these names link to Arcadia?
- No, like "nothing" nothing...

67
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:44,511
No school records, no addresses,
no birth certificates.

68
00:04:44,636 --> 00:04:45,784
They've been erased.

69
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:49,451
But I did find Dr. Roberts.

70
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:53,289
You found that
while we were sitting here?

71
00:04:53,414 --> 00:04:54,675
Yeah. It's nothing.

72
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,562
It's amazing.
I've always wanted to do that.

73
00:04:57,687 --> 00:04:59,446
I could show you some stuff.

74
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,134
As soon as I get you a refill.

75
00:05:06,157 --> 00:05:08,875
What do we know about her?
Did you do a background check?

76
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:10,893
She's a nice girl
who needs our help.

77
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:13,143
Yeah, but she could be
a spy or a terrorist.

78
00:05:13,268 --> 00:05:15,274
She looks kind of like a terrorist.

79
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,858
I'm gonna keep my eye on her.

80
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,660
According to this...

81
00:05:29,745 --> 00:05:31,629
Up until eight months ago,

82
00:05:31,754 --> 00:05:34,583
Dr. Roberts worked
for JRP Pharmaceuticals.

83
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,335
That's the company that made HT1.

84
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,410
Now, JRP Pharmaceuticals
was bought by Pallagen Laboratories.

85
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:42,424
Dr. Roberts and all the other
researchers were let go.

86
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,635
Maybe we should
maybe take this to the...

87
00:05:45,902 --> 00:05:47,930
- Poker room?
- Yeah. Where's Eliot?

88
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:50,822
He had to change his shirt.
He got coffee on it.

89
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:52,351
And some blood and some teeth.

90
00:05:54,386 --> 00:05:57,624
Why don't you call him and tell him
to go to Dr. Roberts' home address,

91
00:05:57,749 --> 00:06:01,235
and, Parker, you and Sophie
do things the old-fashioned way.

92
00:06:02,344 --> 00:06:04,667
Knock on some doors in Arcadi...

93
00:06:10,547 --> 00:06:13,111
Want to go knock
on some doors in Arcadia?

94
00:06:13,236 --> 00:06:14,540
Right. Got it.

95
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:19,481
All right.

96
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:29,346
Door's locked
and nobody's answering.

97
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,105
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

98
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:38,188
See if you can break in,
but be subtle.

99
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:43,995
Not subtle.

100
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:45,713
Dr. Roberts?

101
00:06:58,068 --> 00:07:00,252
Pretty small apartment
to be driving a BMW.

102
00:07:00,815 --> 00:07:03,213
He doesn't drive a BMW.
He drives a moped.

103
00:07:06,023 --> 00:07:08,677
- It's a flash drive.
- Plug it into your phone.

104
00:07:09,552 --> 00:07:10,552
Really?

105
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:17,478
You getting this?

106
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:21,646
According to these files, Dr. Roberts
was meeting with Darren Hoffman.

107
00:07:22,153 --> 00:07:24,693
Now, Hoffman was trying
to buy something from him

108
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,071
for $200,000.

109
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,739
Sounds like a bribe.

110
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:32,034
Nothing in his account shows up that big.
If it was a bribe, he didn't take it.

111
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,703
We got to figure out
who this Hoffman guy is.

112
00:07:34,828 --> 00:07:35,996
Give me a second.

113
00:07:36,894 --> 00:07:40,872
Cross-referencing Dr. Roberts'
cell records with his file and...

114
00:07:40,997 --> 00:07:43,337
Hoffman is the CEO
of Pallagen Laboratories.

115
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:46,173
Pallagen is the company
that bought JRP Pharmaceuticals.

116
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:51,916
It shows that Hoffman doesn't have
a background in medicine or science.

117
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,728
He's a career executive.

118
00:07:53,853 --> 00:07:55,974
He started with finance,
went to telecom,

119
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,436
jumped to software, and then he jumped
to the top spot in Pallagen a year ago.

120
00:07:59,985 --> 00:08:01,480
Yeah, I know his type.

121
00:08:01,883 --> 00:08:03,649
He's chasing the CEO chair.

122
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,588
He's moving from company to company,
juicing their profits

123
00:08:06,713 --> 00:08:09,588
and using the publicity to move
onto the next corporation.

124
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:11,198
No loyalty.

125
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:15,072
But what could Hoffman want
from Dr. Roberts, that's worth $200,000?

126
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:18,789
<i>I found your Dr. Roberts.</i>

127
00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:22,334
They made
it look like a heart attack.

128
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,659
What do you mean "made it look"?

129
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,782
There's nine places
a professional will use

130
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,097
to deliver an injection.

131
00:08:35,342 --> 00:08:37,014
They went under the fingernail.

132
00:08:39,739 --> 00:08:41,353
Your Dr. Roberts was murdered.

133
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,909
<i>We found the people in Arcadia.</i>

134
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:51,284
Tiffany Helland, Michelle Coratola,

135
00:08:52,044 --> 00:08:53,344
Nicholas Paxton.

136
00:08:53,469 --> 00:08:55,176
<i>Who have you talked to so far?</i>

137
00:08:56,651 --> 00:08:58,273
That's not really an option.

138
00:09:09,873 --> 00:09:11,223
They're all dead.

139
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:24,104
Here it is.

140
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:28,108
15 people from Arcadia
participated in the HT1 drug trial.

141
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,065
10 of them died of liver failure.

142
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,663
Ashley's sister was not
the only victim of HT1.

143
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:34,892
See, Hoffman, what he...

144
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,408
Come on.

145
00:09:36,749 --> 00:09:39,100
Damn it, Hardison.
He keeps changing the settings...

146
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:40,584
Where is he?

147
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:43,207
He's downstairs in the poker room.
He's looking after Ashley.

148
00:09:43,928 --> 00:09:45,278
Parker's helping.

149
00:09:45,403 --> 00:09:46,753
Parker's helping?

150
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:52,102
There. So after Pallagen
buys JRP Pharmaceuticals,

151
00:09:52,227 --> 00:09:54,593
Hoffman has all the online records
of Arcadia erased.

152
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:56,720
Now, luckily,

153
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:59,644
his reach doesn't extend
to the Arcadia public library.

154
00:10:00,007 --> 00:10:02,958
So, Roberts finds a connection
between Hoffman and HT1.

155
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,612
Hoffman offers him
the 200 grand to silence him.

156
00:10:05,737 --> 00:10:08,482
But Roberts doesn't take the bribe,
so Hoffman has him...

157
00:10:08,928 --> 00:10:09,942
erased.

158
00:10:12,005 --> 00:10:14,978
I'm thinking the Swedish rail con.

159
00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:18,269
The Cairo flyer?

160
00:10:18,394 --> 00:10:20,413
No way.
I'm not wearing that dress again.

161
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:24,706
The double-blind.

162
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:47,217
Welcome to Vioplex training day.
I'm Trina. And you are?

163
00:10:47,512 --> 00:10:49,304
Laurie.
Laurie Sprang.

164
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:52,412
All right, let's see.
Laurie. Welcome.

165
00:10:52,537 --> 00:10:54,436
Well, it looks like
you're the last to arrive.

166
00:10:54,561 --> 00:10:56,214
Let's go meet the other ladies.

167
00:10:56,482 --> 00:10:57,963
Come on. Don't be shy.
Come on.

168
00:10:58,088 --> 00:11:01,277
Parker, you break in to Hoffman's office,
find out what Roberts had on him.

169
00:11:01,402 --> 00:11:04,276
A lot of pharmaceutical reps are
hired out of cheerleading programs.

170
00:11:04,401 --> 00:11:06,202
Now you, Laurie Sprang,

171
00:11:06,327 --> 00:11:09,099
you attended the university of Iowa,
where you were a cheerleader,

172
00:11:09,224 --> 00:11:12,379
graduated with a 2.9 GPA,
and you were also second runner-up

173
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,164
for the miss Iowa beauty pageant.

174
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:16,300
- Beauty queen?
- Yeah, it's a nice touch, right?

175
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,394
It was Ashley's idea. Pound it.

176
00:11:18,997 --> 00:11:22,100
Meanwhile, Sophie is gonna
establish a relationship

177
00:11:22,225 --> 00:11:25,704
with Hoffman so that when
we rattle his cage with your Intel,

178
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:27,391
he's gonna run to Sophie.

179
00:11:27,593 --> 00:11:29,968
It's gonna be tough for Sophie
to make contact this week.

180
00:11:30,093 --> 00:11:32,779
His whole schedule is filled
with this drug launch thing.

181
00:11:32,904 --> 00:11:35,152
So get somebody else's appointment,
like... how about her?

182
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:37,237
Jennifer Pearson, F.D.A.?

183
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,737
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:38,862 --> 00:11:41,719
How do you keep the real
Jennifer Pearson from showing up?

185
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:55,839
Miss Pearson?
How are you?

186
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,697
Phil, part of Mr. Hoffman's team.

187
00:11:57,822 --> 00:12:00,201
- He's asked me to show you around.
- That's okay.

188
00:12:00,326 --> 00:12:02,546
I'm just here to sign some
papers for the Vioplex launch.

189
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:05,805
- It's just a formality.
- Yes, ma'am. But see, here at Pallagen,

190
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,851
we like to make sure that
everyone we work with

191
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,028
- is part of the family. Okay?
- All right.

192
00:12:10,153 --> 00:12:11,713
- So do me the honor?
- Sure. Fine.

193
00:12:11,838 --> 00:12:13,908
Thank you so much.
That way I get to keep my job.

194
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,359
This way.

195
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,037
- Mr. Hoffman. I'm...
- Jennifer Pearson, F.D.A.

196
00:12:27,526 --> 00:12:29,010
More red tape.

197
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,107
We prefer to call
them safety measures.

198
00:12:35,451 --> 00:12:36,639
Of course.

199
00:12:37,926 --> 00:12:40,342
We take safety very
seriously here at Pallagen.

200
00:12:40,987 --> 00:12:42,276
I'm sorry, I've just...

201
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:46,348
I've heard so many amazing things about
this company and the man that runs it.

202
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,265
Well, you know...

203
00:12:48,983 --> 00:12:52,562
- You can't believe everything you hear.
- I'm sure in this case, I can.

204
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:54,758
I know you must be right busy,

205
00:12:54,883 --> 00:12:57,619
but I was hoping
you might show me around.

206
00:12:58,007 --> 00:12:59,277
I'd love to...

207
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,116
discuss the possibility
of doing some consulting for you.

208
00:13:04,563 --> 00:13:05,826
I'd be honored.

209
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:08,120
"Consulting" is code for "bribe."

210
00:13:09,033 --> 00:13:11,722
Yeah, doctors who review drugs
for the F.D.A. are allowed,

211
00:13:11,847 --> 00:13:14,798
by law, to take consulting
fees from the drug companies.

212
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:19,550
See, it's $50,000 to each
doctor on the F.D.A. panel,

213
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:22,376
$200,000 to the director
of the New York medical school

214
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,611
to speak at the pain
awareness institute.

215
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:26,858
And then $25,000 to each celebrity

216
00:13:26,983 --> 00:13:29,104
that attends the annual
dinner at the institute.

217
00:13:29,229 --> 00:13:31,163
What's the pain awareness institute?

218
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:33,929
It's a foundation set up
by Hoffman and Pallagen

219
00:13:34,054 --> 00:13:35,772
to legally funnel bribes.

220
00:13:36,313 --> 00:13:37,513
This is legal?

221
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,042
- We're in the wrong business, man.
- Parker, Sophie's cleaning out Hoffman.

222
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:43,321
Get in position.

223
00:13:45,728 --> 00:13:46,905
Let me...

224
00:13:47,932 --> 00:13:50,732
show you around our humble facility.

225
00:13:52,335 --> 00:13:54,458
I'm sure it's not humble at all.

226
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:01,339
I'm clear.

227
00:14:01,597 --> 00:14:03,318
<i>Parker, you're up.
Parker?</i>

228
00:14:05,397 --> 00:14:07,471
And we have a volunteer.
Thank you, Laurie.

229
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:11,429
I actually wasn't volunteering. I just
have to use the little girls' room.

230
00:14:11,554 --> 00:14:13,935
Don't even pretend to be shy.
I read your bio.

231
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,739
Ladies, Laurie was second
runner-up for miss Iowa.

232
00:14:17,864 --> 00:14:20,433
Give her a hand.
All right, this is Dale.

233
00:14:20,558 --> 00:14:22,991
He'll be playing Dr. Nesson.
This is your first meeting.

234
00:14:23,116 --> 00:14:26,218
Go ahead, introduce yourself,
and then introduce Vioplex.

235
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:28,658
- Dr. Nesson.
- And remember to smile.

236
00:14:31,098 --> 00:14:32,411
Dr. Nesson, I'm Laurie.

237
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:34,947
I've got great drugs.
Do you want some?

238
00:14:36,211 --> 00:14:37,482
Okay, good.

239
00:14:37,607 --> 00:14:40,292
But let's try to elaborate
on Vioplex a little more.

240
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,130
Okay?
Okay, go ahead.

241
00:14:42,594 --> 00:14:44,390
- All right.
- I love Vioplex.

242
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:46,793
It makes you happy, and not
hungry, and you sleep better.

243
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:48,034
Do you want some?

244
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,934
Vioplex is actually pain medication

245
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:55,812
not an anti-depressant
or sleep aid or a diet pill.

246
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,771
Did you read
your sales training manual?

247
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:03,068
I left it in the little girls' room,
so...

248
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,299
- Okay, why don't you go get it?
- Okay.

249
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,826
All right, who's next?

250
00:15:34,886 --> 00:15:36,755
Locked file on a locked workstation.

251
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,061
I smell secrets.

252
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:41,289
256-bit AES encryption?

253
00:15:41,414 --> 00:15:42,607
Adorable.

254
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,652
Wait. Hold on.
This right here.

255
00:15:45,053 --> 00:15:46,345
Make that bigger?

256
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:51,577
All right, where is...

257
00:15:53,073 --> 00:15:54,115
This.

258
00:16:00,157 --> 00:16:01,209
It's identical.

259
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:02,824
It's HT1.

260
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:05,952
I've spent three years
learning everything

261
00:16:06,077 --> 00:16:09,146
I could about the drug
that killed my sister.

262
00:16:09,271 --> 00:16:10,860
That is HT1.

263
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:14,957
Okay, so I thought
Roberts made a connection

264
00:16:15,082 --> 00:16:16,570
between HT1 and Hoffman.

265
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:18,364
No. It's between HT1 and Vioplex.

266
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:19,965
**** drink before the lunch.

267
00:16:21,995 --> 00:16:24,649
<i>So Hoffman is going to release HT1</i>

268
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,959
as Vioplex.

269
00:16:28,162 --> 00:16:29,947
And a lot of people are gonna die.

270
00:16:34,808 --> 00:16:36,737
Vioplex is HT1.

271
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:39,497
Here, they just added trace amounts
of a time-released protein inhibitor.

272
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:42,125
It'll delay the liver failure,
hide the symptoms.

273
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,471
Instead of dying in months,
it could take years.

274
00:16:44,596 --> 00:16:46,046
Let me see his bribes again.

275
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:49,049
So those are all the people
you'd pay off if you were trying

276
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,884
to push through a toxic drug.

277
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,609
He can't get away with this.

278
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:56,576
The FDA, they get 500,000 complaints
every year about bad side effects.

279
00:16:56,701 --> 00:16:58,802
By the time anyone figures out
what's going on,

280
00:16:58,927 --> 00:17:00,938
Hoffman will be long gone
onto his next CEO gig.

281
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,334
So he'll never be held accountable
for the people he killed.

282
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:07,025
That's right. We need physical evidence
that HT1 and Vioplex are the same thing.

283
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:11,091
- We need the HT1 vials.
- You think they still have them?

284
00:17:11,216 --> 00:17:13,323
Yeah. Drug companies keep
samples of everything.

285
00:17:13,637 --> 00:17:16,576
They still got vials of smallpox
in over a dozen countries.

286
00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:19,399
- Do I want to know which countries?
- Parker...

287
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,580
I need you to look
around Hoffman's office

288
00:17:22,705 --> 00:17:25,147
for anything that tells us
where they keep the samples.

289
00:17:25,769 --> 00:17:28,462
We need to get the F.D.A.
To crack down on Vioplex.

290
00:17:28,587 --> 00:17:31,220
Eliot, don't lose
Jennifer Pearson, all right?

291
00:17:31,345 --> 00:17:33,677
We're gonna get the vials
to her before the launch.

292
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:36,471
- <i>She is now part of the con.</i>
- Except the whole top floor.

293
00:17:36,596 --> 00:17:39,585
All the windows were replaced,
and we put in solar panels.

294
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:42,338
Dude, she's on a flight
in two hours.

295
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:44,354
Well, do not let her
get on the plane.

296
00:17:45,862 --> 00:17:48,331
Listen, this tour has been lovely,

297
00:17:48,456 --> 00:17:50,961
but I really should sign
the Vioplex papers now.

298
00:17:51,148 --> 00:17:53,311
- I need to get to the airport.
- Right.

299
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,546
Or you can sign them tomorrow

300
00:17:57,662 --> 00:18:00,040
and spend the day walking
around the city...

301
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,884
with me.

302
00:18:14,132 --> 00:18:15,427
Found a safe.

303
00:18:16,948 --> 00:18:19,667
I'm just saying, it's...
It's a beautiful city,

304
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:22,519
and I'd hate for you to miss it.

305
00:18:25,473 --> 00:18:27,756
- Let me make a quick call.
- All right.

306
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:32,539
Birthday.

307
00:18:32,786 --> 00:18:33,799
Typical.

308
00:18:45,944 --> 00:18:47,292
Okay, I've got something.

309
00:18:57,452 --> 00:18:58,530
All right.

310
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:01,139
See, now that...
that right there, that is so...

311
00:19:03,234 --> 00:19:04,818
not good.

312
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:07,771
Parker, security is on their way
to Hoffman's office right now.

313
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,968
- You got to get out.
- Parker, you don't get out.

314
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:12,066
Stay right where you are
till we got what we need.

315
00:19:12,582 --> 00:19:14,152
How much time do I have?
60 seconds?

316
00:19:14,578 --> 00:19:15,865
No, 40.

317
00:19:16,562 --> 00:19:18,389
35. No, now 20.

318
00:19:18,514 --> 00:19:20,492
No, you got 19.
You're gonna stay where you are.

319
00:19:22,876 --> 00:19:24,743
Nate, look, security is
literally seconds away

320
00:19:24,868 --> 00:19:26,039
from Hoffman's office.

321
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:29,168
- We need those vials.
- But we also need Parker.

322
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:33,880
Done.

323
00:19:47,745 --> 00:19:50,078
- Listen, I need you to go over to...
- What the hell was that?

324
00:19:50,203 --> 00:19:52,665
You pushed Parker way past the
red line in that office today.

325
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,040
- I made the call. What?
- Because it was a medical company?

326
00:19:55,165 --> 00:19:57,071
Because anything that
reminds you of your son...

327
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,529
- Since when do you question...
- Since you went off the rails,

328
00:19:59,654 --> 00:20:02,482
and we had to pull you out of prison
and ended up getting blackmailed,

329
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:04,560
- thank you very much.
- Fair enough.

330
00:20:05,147 --> 00:20:07,789
You still run this crew,
but you're a thief now just like me.

331
00:20:07,914 --> 00:20:10,872
And that means I can call you out
any time I think you're out of control.

332
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,254
- And if I say no?
- I'll walk.

333
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:16,714
And remember, Nate...

334
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,090
I'm the only one that
actually likes you.

335
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:25,860
Little Jennifer Pearson's
wearing you out, ain't she?

336
00:20:26,394 --> 00:20:28,616
Dude, we walked the
freedom trail twice.

337
00:20:28,982 --> 00:20:29,903
Nice.

338
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,356
No, man, the actual freedom trail.

339
00:20:34,097 --> 00:20:37,551
We took paddle boats to the public
garden, shopped on Newbury Street.

340
00:20:37,676 --> 00:20:39,612
I went to something called
the Boston duck tour.

341
00:20:42,562 --> 00:20:44,344
The information I got
from Hoffman's office

342
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:47,391
confirms that he's still got vials
of HT1 in Pallagen's storage.

343
00:20:47,516 --> 00:20:49,488
Thing is, the vials
are stored in a case

344
00:20:49,613 --> 00:20:52,667
amongst hundreds of other cases
in one of 10 storage facilities.

345
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,187
Now, if I do my math, that
means this case was...

346
00:20:55,312 --> 00:20:56,963
It's gonna be hard to find!

347
00:20:58,043 --> 00:21:00,277
I believe I was making that point.

348
00:21:00,402 --> 00:21:02,924
We are going to get
Hoffman to lead us to the vials.

349
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:05,548
We'll use Sophie's friendship
with him to get information.

350
00:21:05,673 --> 00:21:07,181
Then I'll enter the game to push.

351
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:10,700
You realize the last guy that
pushed Hoffman ended up dead.

352
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,661
Let him take his best shot.

353
00:21:12,786 --> 00:21:14,606
We'll see who walks away this time.

354
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:18,682
Prison's changed him.

355
00:21:20,451 --> 00:21:21,751
Better or worse?

356
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:23,364
I'm not sure.

357
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,693
I'm really excited
about working with you.

358
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:34,375
I suppose we should discuss what kind
of arrangements you have in mind.

359
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:38,003
As my consultant,
I would expect that any complaints

360
00:21:38,128 --> 00:21:42,008
about Vioplex would be moved
to the bottom of the pile.

361
00:21:42,413 --> 00:21:43,804
That's easy enough.

362
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:45,855
But if there are...

363
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:50,251
persistent complaints,
eventually, people will take notice.

364
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:52,546
"Eventually" is the key word.

365
00:21:52,671 --> 00:21:55,813
Eventually, people will die.

366
00:21:56,186 --> 00:21:59,692
Their friends and family will call
the government, and we'll be forced

367
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:03,821
to make a very public and heartfelt
apology and pay some fines.

368
00:22:04,243 --> 00:22:07,825
But you know what happens
between now and eventually?

369
00:22:09,165 --> 00:22:11,528
We make billions of dollars.

370
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:17,210
These are not small fines.

371
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:19,629
Last year, my department
handled a case

372
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:22,793
where the company had
to pay out $2.5 billion.

373
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:24,998
Everybody heard about that.

374
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:27,644
What the news didn't
tell you is that company made

375
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:29,722
$16 billion on the same drug.

376
00:22:30,103 --> 00:22:33,704
That fine was 14% of the profit.
14%.

377
00:22:34,489 --> 00:22:36,104
That's like tipping your waiter.

378
00:22:36,766 --> 00:22:39,166
"Thank you very much
for taking our drugs.

379
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,440
Here's a little something
for your family."

380
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,406
I wasn't hired by
Pallagen to cure cancer.

381
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,418
I was brought in to take this company
to the next level.

382
00:22:50,816 --> 00:22:52,787
And Vioplex is gonna do just that.

383
00:22:53,808 --> 00:22:56,207
Here is to the future of Pallagen.

384
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:05,273
- Chilly?
- Yeah, it's cold in here.

385
00:23:05,398 --> 00:23:06,715
Here. Take my jacket.

386
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:08,555
Thanks.

387
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:10,605
What a gentleman.

388
00:23:10,883 --> 00:23:12,793
No one's done that for ages.

389
00:23:13,614 --> 00:23:15,034
I'm so sorry.

390
00:23:15,403 --> 00:23:16,680
I have to take this.

391
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:18,520
Hello?

392
00:23:25,165 --> 00:23:26,451
That seat's taken.

393
00:23:29,657 --> 00:23:31,554
Yes, yes. Yes, it is.

394
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:35,246
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- I'm a friend of Dr. Roberts.

395
00:23:36,427 --> 00:23:38,624
Is that supposed to mean something?

396
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,416
It means that I know Vioplex is HT1

397
00:23:41,613 --> 00:23:43,046
in a clever disguise.

398
00:23:49,355 --> 00:23:50,641
What do you want?

399
00:23:50,766 --> 00:23:53,475
- $5 million.
- That's ridiculous.

400
00:23:53,697 --> 00:23:56,442
- No one's ever gonna believe you.
- I have proof.

401
00:23:58,247 --> 00:24:01,147
You really should have kept those vials
somewhere more secure.

402
00:24:06,516 --> 00:24:08,569
Wire me the money by 5:00 P.M.

403
00:24:15,927 --> 00:24:16,927
Are you...

404
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:19,366
I'm sorry about that.

405
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:22,376
Are you okay?
You don't look so good.

406
00:24:23,854 --> 00:24:25,776
It's just a headache.

407
00:24:26,918 --> 00:24:28,980
Would you mind if I caught
up with you at the launch?

408
00:24:29,105 --> 00:24:30,802
Of course. I'll see you later.

409
00:24:33,475 --> 00:24:35,181
Don't forget your jacket.

410
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:36,906
Thank you, Mr. Hoffman.

411
00:25:37,031 --> 00:25:39,036
GPS-enabled hi-def button cam.

412
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,081
Don't forget your... your jacket.

413
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:51,961
Now, Parker, look...

414
00:25:52,086 --> 00:25:54,260
we have the location, all right?

415
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:56,387
Got the access codes, and
we have the case number.

416
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,795
All you have to do is go
pick the lock on the cage.

417
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,749
I'm gonna compare Hoffman's path with
yours and lead you to the right room.

418
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:04,548
Good luck.

419
00:26:05,993 --> 00:26:06,810
Luck?

420
00:26:08,105 --> 00:26:09,643
Do I look like I need luck?

421
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,639
Parker, she just meant,
like, you know...

422
00:26:16,363 --> 00:26:17,612
Go do your magic.

423
00:26:22,758 --> 00:26:23,709
I'm in.

424
00:26:34,733 --> 00:26:36,469
Hoffman is up to something.
Hardison,

425
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:38,022
<i>are we tracking his phone?</i>

426
00:26:38,147 --> 00:26:40,772
I've got a signal. I just
don't have a connection point.

427
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,575
And now I have my connection point.

428
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,170
I've been expecting your call.

429
00:26:47,295 --> 00:26:49,063
I know a good deal when I see one.

430
00:26:49,405 --> 00:26:51,442
You get your money,
I get your silence.

431
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:52,845
That's the deal.

432
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,399
<i>But I like to do these things in person.</i>
Eliminates the room for error.

433
00:26:56,524 --> 00:26:58,783
You're gonna have to
come to me for your payment.

434
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,401
- Nate, no. Be at
- <i>Pallagen in 20 minutes.</i>

435
00:27:01,526 --> 00:27:03,888
- It's not good. You know it. Don't...
- I'll be there.

436
00:27:04,844 --> 00:27:06,950
- What were you saying?
- You'll be there. It's a trap.

437
00:27:07,075 --> 00:27:09,059
Do you want to end
up like Dr. Roberts?

438
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,687
All Hoffman has to do is send
his goons out into the crowd

439
00:27:11,812 --> 00:27:13,464
to brush past you with a syringe.

440
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,563
- She's right. It's a suicide mission.
- All right, listen.

441
00:27:16,688 --> 00:27:18,582
I don't do it, it's
gonna tip Hoffman off

442
00:27:18,707 --> 00:27:20,473
and this whole thing
will fall apart.

443
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,557
You are gonna have to get it done
before they manage to kill me.

444
00:27:59,276 --> 00:28:01,903
I'm in.
Does anyone see anything suspicious?

445
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,080
No, but that's kind of the point.

446
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:10,811
They're gonna try to blend in.

447
00:28:10,936 --> 00:28:13,566
Look for guys who got a couple
inches on everybody else here,

448
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,359
and hands in their pocket,

449
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:17,516
Shoes that lace up
a little too high.

450
00:28:17,641 --> 00:28:19,905
Security guys always wear
shoes that they can run in.

451
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,669
Narrows it down.

452
00:28:24,205 --> 00:28:25,332
Don't you think?

453
00:28:25,951 --> 00:28:27,120
Yeah, sure.

454
00:28:27,245 --> 00:28:28,791
Were you even listening to me?

455
00:28:29,734 --> 00:28:32,406
I've dated a lot of you drug
company guys. You're all the same.

456
00:28:32,531 --> 00:28:34,867
You're nice, you're handsome,

457
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,851
And married to the job.

458
00:28:38,853 --> 00:28:41,260
I really enjoyed our time together.

459
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:43,978
I'm just looking for someone
who's a little less settled.

460
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:46,508
It's not a criticism.

461
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:48,133
You are a great guy.

462
00:28:49,034 --> 00:28:51,964
I'm just not looking for someone
who sits behind a desk all day.

463
00:28:52,089 --> 00:28:55,289
I want someone who travels
the world and takes risks,

464
00:28:56,252 --> 00:28:58,915
Somebody a little more dangerous.

465
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:03,324
- Right.
- I'm sorry.

466
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:09,856
Let me just... You're gonna...
Wait till after the launch

467
00:29:10,433 --> 00:29:12,985
- to sign the papers though, right?
- Sure.

468
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,877
We can hang out, still be friends.

469
00:29:15,657 --> 00:29:17,837
We can still be friends.

470
00:29:18,734 --> 00:29:20,553
You all right?
You need time to shake it off?

471
00:29:20,678 --> 00:29:23,469
<i>Shut up!</i>
Let's get this show over with.

472
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,033
Hardison, how we
doing with the vials?

473
00:29:27,148 --> 00:29:28,599
Parker's two minutes out.

474
00:29:35,397 --> 00:29:37,691
Wait. Stop. Parker, you're going the
wrong way. Turn around.

475
00:29:46,113 --> 00:29:47,910
<i>All right, now make a right.</i>

476
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:51,080
<i>There's a security camera
over your right shoulder.</i>

477
00:29:55,695 --> 00:29:56,619
Got it.

478
00:29:59,753 --> 00:30:00,882
What's the code?

479
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,113
- What's the code?
- What?

480
00:30:04,556 --> 00:30:05,626
I don't know.

481
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,478
<i>Give us a minute, give us a minute.</i>

482
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,356
- It's 5-1-1... 5-1-1-9-9-3.
- It's 5-1-1-9-9-3. 5-1-1-9-9-3.

483
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,859
Too many voices, okay?
Too many voices.

484
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,819
There's two 1s and two 9s.
Two 1s and two 9s.

485
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:23,431
Too many voices!

486
00:30:26,234 --> 00:30:29,607
It's 5-1-1-9-9-3.

487
00:30:35,938 --> 00:30:36,938
I'm in.

488
00:30:40,867 --> 00:30:42,131
Good, good, good.

489
00:31:00,221 --> 00:31:02,653
- As you were.
- Almost broke my pen.

490
00:31:04,275 --> 00:31:06,878
I triggered the motion sensors.
The HT1 vials are in the cage.

491
00:31:07,003 --> 00:31:08,367
How long till security's here?

492
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:10,053
- <i>15 seconds.</i>
- Plus or minus?

493
00:31:10,178 --> 00:31:12,077
Plus or minus none.
Get out of there now.

494
00:31:14,355 --> 00:31:16,624
Should we be getting out of here?

495
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:19,418
Go mingle with your fans, I mean.

496
00:31:20,433 --> 00:31:21,433
Not quite.

497
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:24,673
I have one more thing I need to do
*before I can join the party.

498
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,884
<i>Parker has tripped the alarm.</i>

499
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,970
We should clear out before Hoffman
starts putting the pieces together.

500
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:33,682
I'm just gonna get
a glass of champagne.

501
00:31:40,647 --> 00:31:42,566
This is Hoffman.
What?

502
00:31:43,979 --> 00:31:45,320
Did they take anything?

503
00:31:46,131 --> 00:31:47,255
Get in there.

504
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:55,861
Check case number 7298.
Look in the back.

505
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:29,625
- Parker, Sophie, you clear?
- The HT1 vials are still in the cage.

506
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,214
Security's on top of them.

507
00:32:33,489 --> 00:32:34,994
Get out, Nate. Now.

508
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,791
Grab him.

509
00:32:49,348 --> 00:32:50,396
We got him.

510
00:32:55,242 --> 00:32:56,807
So glad you could join us.

511
00:32:58,096 --> 00:32:59,059
What's going on?

512
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,145
The deal's changed.

513
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,695
I thought a businessman like you
would know how to keep a deal.

514
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,063
We had a deal
when you said you had the vials.

515
00:33:13,188 --> 00:33:14,533
But you were bluffing.

516
00:33:14,658 --> 00:33:17,263
Nice, getting me to lead you
to the storage facility.

517
00:33:18,052 --> 00:33:21,209
Too bad the hack you hired
to steal the cases got caught.

518
00:33:21,955 --> 00:33:24,171
- She didn't get caught.
- She left empty-handed.

519
00:33:25,698 --> 00:33:26,698
See?

520
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:29,277
Now I have the vials,
and I have you.

521
00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:34,537
I think we need a new deal.
Wait outside. Don't let anyone in.

522
00:33:42,162 --> 00:33:43,773
Can I get you guys some coffee?

523
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,399
As far as I'm concerned,
the old deal still works.

524
00:33:48,011 --> 00:33:50,627
You give me the money,
and no one finds out That Vioplex

525
00:33:50,752 --> 00:33:52,488
is identical to HT1, right?

526
00:33:53,268 --> 00:33:54,740
So... okay. All right, listen.

527
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,367
I lower the price.

528
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,496
Still negotiating.
Well, I got to admire your persistence.

529
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,059
The truth's gonna come out
once people start dying.

530
00:34:04,184 --> 00:34:08,087
Sure. But by then, Vioplex will have
made this company Billions of dollars.

531
00:34:08,565 --> 00:34:10,965
And I'll have turned that success
into a penthouse office

532
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,630
in a fortune 500.

533
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:14,802
I think I'll try oil next.

534
00:34:15,709 --> 00:34:16,762
<i>Door's clear.</i>

535
00:34:20,455 --> 00:34:22,309
It's a great idea. Great plan.

536
00:34:22,779 --> 00:34:24,687
- There is one little snag.
- What's that?

537
00:34:25,014 --> 00:34:26,311
We stole the vials.

538
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,803
- Then what's this?
- That's an empty box.

539
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,652
We have the...
well, we had the vials.

540
00:34:32,052 --> 00:34:34,225
You "had" the vials.
Where are they now?

541
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:37,032
Now they're in the champagne
that you're drinking.

542
00:35:02,112 --> 00:35:03,434
- Done.
- <i>All right, good.</i>

543
00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:06,588
I'm turning on the motion sensors...

544
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:07,897
Now.

545
00:35:11,398 --> 00:35:12,651
Parker, do it already.

546
00:35:19,878 --> 00:35:21,410
I triggered the motion sensors.

547
00:35:22,635 --> 00:35:25,080
Now, I got to tell you,
it was a pretty concentrated dose,

548
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:28,751
so your liver will fail
in the next few hours, Two days tops.

549
00:35:29,396 --> 00:35:33,088
You should be experiencing nausea,
followed by this intense,

550
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,753
- profound fatigue, loss of appetite...
- Now stop it!

551
00:35:36,732 --> 00:35:39,575
I know you couldn't have drugged
the champagne. I've been watching you

552
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,096
since you got here.

553
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:43,051
I'm not working alone, so...

554
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:46,310
- Excuse me, Mr. Hoffman?
- Who are you?

555
00:35:46,618 --> 00:35:48,228
How did you even get in my office?

556
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,858
Jennifer Pearson, F.D.A. rep.

557
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:51,826
Your assistant said
you were ready for me.

558
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:53,150
My assistant?

559
00:35:53,904 --> 00:35:55,007
The door's clear.

560
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,361
<i>Miss Pearson?</i>

561
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,099
I'm Mr. Hoffman's assistant.
He's waiting for you in his office.

562
00:36:00,964 --> 00:36:03,615
Thank you. I guess
I do still need to sign those forms.

563
00:36:04,545 --> 00:36:06,404
- I'll take that.
- Thank you.

564
00:36:09,226 --> 00:36:11,126
No, I've met the F.D.A. rep.

565
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:13,962
Like I said,

566
00:36:14,558 --> 00:36:15,661
Mr. Hoffman,

567
00:36:16,364 --> 00:36:17,591
I'm not working alone.

568
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:26,183
- What's going on?
- What's go...

569
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,851
You want to stay with him, okay?

570
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,895
He'll explain everything.
But come here first.

571
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,150
You're gonna want to take this.
Run along.

572
00:36:39,635 --> 00:36:42,435
Everyone, stop!
Don't drink the champagne!

573
00:36:43,651 --> 00:36:45,759
Do not drink the champagne!

574
00:36:46,035 --> 00:36:47,996
- We've all been poisoned!
- Mr. Hoffman!

575
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,333
What is going on here?

576
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:54,024
We all need to go to the hospital!

577
00:36:54,597 --> 00:36:56,900
Someone has put HT1

578
00:36:57,138 --> 00:36:58,640
into the champagne!

579
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:10,476
HT1? That's the drug that killed
all those people in Arcadia.

580
00:37:12,048 --> 00:37:13,489
This isn't happening.

581
00:37:13,845 --> 00:37:15,399
This cannot be happening.

582
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,997
You mean that the poison
in the champagne

583
00:37:18,122 --> 00:37:19,903
is the same thing as Vioplex,

584
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,922
Which you're selling
to millions of people?

585
00:37:22,047 --> 00:37:24,949
Someone tampered with that case.
They stole the vials.

586
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:31,290
- These vials?
- No. I opened that. They were gone.

587
00:37:34,768 --> 00:37:36,753
- Go do your magic.
- Remember, it's a trick case.

588
00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:38,881
All you have to do
is drop the vials in,

589
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:40,382
close the case, and...

590
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,508
abracadabra.

591
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:50,142
How are you going to explain
this to your shareholders?

592
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,572
- Sir, right here.
- Mr. Hoffman, please.

593
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:56,064
Mr. Hoffman,
what does this mean for Vioplex?

594
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,876
50 high-profile doctors,

595
00:37:59,001 --> 00:38:01,589
two dozen medical journalists,
and an F.D.A. rep.

596
00:38:01,714 --> 00:38:03,157
That should do it.

597
00:38:04,435 --> 00:38:06,749
You do realize that that stunt
you pulled

598
00:38:06,874 --> 00:38:08,577
defines "out of control".

599
00:38:09,311 --> 00:38:12,424
I just wanted you to see that
I would never put any of you at risk

600
00:38:12,549 --> 00:38:15,471
if I wasn't willing to take
the same chances myself.

601
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,660
I love how you think
that's comforting.

602
00:38:30,384 --> 00:38:33,268
So, what do you do now?
Your quest is complete.

603
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,420
I don't know.
This just

604
00:38:35,723 --> 00:38:37,981
- consumed my life for so long.
- Well, here.

605
00:38:39,215 --> 00:38:40,858
I got this out of Hoffman's file.

606
00:38:40,983 --> 00:38:43,227
Those are all the families
affected by HT1.

607
00:38:43,352 --> 00:38:45,364
Now, some people are sick,
some people died,

608
00:38:45,919 --> 00:38:47,532
but they all need help.

609
00:38:48,405 --> 00:38:49,789
Look at all of them.

610
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:51,370
I mean, what could I do?

611
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,290
That is a lot of money.

612
00:39:00,415 --> 00:39:03,750
See, FDA awards whistle-blowers
a percentage of the fine.

613
00:39:04,439 --> 00:39:06,288
And when the fine's
a couple million...

614
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:11,851
Thank you!

615
00:39:15,711 --> 00:39:18,272
- I'm glad she finally got closure.
- Who?

616
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,180
Ashley.

617
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:24,894
- You need to talk to him.
- Who?

618
00:39:28,353 --> 00:39:30,699
You don't like it
when he talks to other women.

619
00:39:32,165 --> 00:39:33,870
I don't care who he talks to.

620
00:39:37,473 --> 00:39:39,710
What you're feeling
is called jealousy, Parker.

621
00:39:43,578 --> 00:39:46,091
I'm not jealous. No.
No, I'm not jealous.

622
00:39:47,286 --> 00:39:50,259
No. It's just that,
when I see them together, I...

623
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:52,806
Don't like it.

624
00:39:54,078 --> 00:39:55,934
You need to tell him how you feel.

625
00:39:57,581 --> 00:39:59,559
- I should get going.
- Already?

626
00:40:05,816 --> 00:40:08,638
But if I ever cross paths
with another evil CEO,

627
00:40:08,908 --> 00:40:11,179
- I'll know who to call.
- I'm looking forward to it.

628
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:34,719
- What happened here?
- Nothing.

629
00:40:34,844 --> 00:40:35,807
Cheap glass.

630
00:40:40,215 --> 00:40:42,397
I'm tired. I'll see you later.

631
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,794
So, Ashley...

632
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:51,740
Nice girl.

633
00:40:52,196 --> 00:40:54,034
Yeah. She seems pretty cool.

634
00:40:54,358 --> 00:40:55,535
Strange teeth.

635
00:40:55,936 --> 00:40:56,995
I hadn't noticed.

636
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,531
- Really?
- No.

637
00:41:02,742 --> 00:41:04,419
I have to tell you something.

638
00:41:10,904 --> 00:41:12,374
Did you want to talk now?

639
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:17,555
So, the thing is,
I think that maybe I might be

640
00:41:17,869 --> 00:41:18,892
having feelings.

641
00:41:20,409 --> 00:41:22,573
Like weird, weird feelings...

642
00:41:23,643 --> 00:41:24,648
for...

643
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,406
pretzels.

644
00:41:35,983 --> 00:41:37,077
Pretzels.

645
00:41:42,664 --> 00:41:44,113
Well, they're right here,

646
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,016
when you want them.
