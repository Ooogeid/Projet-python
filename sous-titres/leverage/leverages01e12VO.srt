19
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,580

THIS IS PORTIA delDUCCIO
FROM THE VATICAN MUSEUM.

24
00:01:50,876 --> 00:01:53,067

36
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,049
I'M A FUNCTIONING ALCOHOLIC,
YOU KNOW?

37
00:02:24,422 --> 00:02:27,362
AND THE TRICK IS NOT TO GET
HUNG UP ON THE "ALCOHOLIC."

38
00:02:27,362 --> 00:02:30,688
BUT CELEBRATE THE "FUNCTIONING"
PART OF THE SENTENCE.

39
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:32,609

OH!

64
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,242
MICHELANGELO'S DAVID.

65
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:01,362
THE MOST FAMOUS STATUE
IN THE WORLD.

66
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:04,613
SCULPTED BETWEEN 1501
AND 1504,

67
00:04:04,613 --> 00:04:06,437
COMMISSIONED

00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:10,266
LIKE ALL SCULPTORS, MICHELANGELO MADE
SMALL SCALE MODELS,

69
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:13,945
OR, WELL, WHAT'S COMMONLY KNOWN
AS MAQUETTES, FIRST.

70
00:04:13,945 --> 00:04:15,977
I- I KNOW ALL THIS.

71
00:04:15,977 --> 00:04:19,492
NO, NO, NO. SEE, WHILE YOU ARE
WELL-VERSED IN DEAD-GUY ART,

72
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:20,715
I MYSELF AM NOT.

73
00:04:20,715 --> 00:04:24,229
MY ENTIRE CRIMINAL CAREER IS BASED
ON TECHNOLOGY BUILT AFTER 1981.

74
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:26,196
SO I AM RIVETED.
QUITE SO.

75
00:04:26,196 --> 00:04:27,660
PLEASE, DO GO ON.

76
00:04:32,214 --> 00:04:35,435
HE FAMOUSLY MADE TWO MODELS
FOR THE STATUE,

77
00:04:35,435 --> 00:04:37,511
CLAY-FIRED, THEN BRONZED,
IDENTICAL.

78
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,903
OVER THE LAST 400 YEARS,
THEY HAVE BEEN SOLD,

79
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:42,375
LOST, STOLEN,
REDISCOVERED DOZENS OF TIMES.

80
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,630
WHO HAS THEM NOW?

81
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,189
WELL, THE SECOND DAVID
WAS STOLEN FROM THE VATICAN 10 YEARS AGO.

82
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:49,392
AND, WELL,
IT'S NEVER BEEN FOUND.

83
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,519
AND THE FIRST DAVID...

84
00:04:53,131 --> 00:04:54,591

86
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:59,709
I'M GIVING YOU
A SNEAK PREVIEW.

87
00:05:13,995 --> 00:05:16,626
AND NOW
THE MAIN ATTRACTION.

88
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,271
RANDOMIZED LASER GRID
REPEATS EVERY FIVE MINUTES.

89
00:05:42,198 --> 00:05:44,014
SERIOUS SECURITY.

90
00:05:44,416 --> 00:05:46,704
THIS IS AN OLD VAULT
THAT I CONVERTED --

91
00:05:46,704 --> 00:05:49,263
4- INCH STEEL
BEHIND THESE PLASTER WALLS.

92
00:05:49,263 --> 00:05:50,943
INFRARED DETECTION.

93
00:05:51,892 --> 00:05:53,816
VIBRATION DETECTION.

94
00:05:54,162 --> 00:05:55,886
AND...

95
00:05:58,619 --> 00:06:00,389
...THE FIRST DAVID.

96
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:10,348
MAN, AM I GLAD I DON'T HAVE TO
BREAK IN THERE.

97
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:12,763
THAT IS ONE SICK
SECURITY SYSTEM.

98
00:06:12,763 --> 00:06:14,131
WHAT, WITH OUR TOOLS?

99
00:06:14,131 --> 00:06:15,492
GIVE ME THREE DAYS
OF PREP,

100
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:18,682
IT'D BE LIKE TAKING DIAMONDS
FROM THE FRENCH NATIONAL BANK.

101
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:20,505
THAT'S LIKE TAKING CANDY
FROM A BABY.

102
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,314
I GOT IT.

103
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,562
A VERY EASY THING
TO DO.

104
00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:23,831
GOT...IT.

105
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:26,063
OH, LOOK, LITTLE BUDDY.

106
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:28,182
THAT'S YOUR NEW HOME!

107
00:06:28,182 --> 00:06:31,180
CAN YOU PLEASE NOT PLAY
WITH THE LITTLE NAKED MAN?

108
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,355
-PLEASE.
-I'M NOT.

109
00:06:34,238 --> 00:06:37,210
WE SELL BLACKPOOLE
A FAKE SECOND DAVID.

110
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,343
YOU KNOW HE'S GOING TO INSURE IT
WITH I.Y.S.

111
00:06:39,343 --> 00:06:41,567
THEN WE LET HIM PUT IT
ON DISPLAY IN HIS MUSEUM.

112
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,550
AND WHEN IT'S DISCOVERED
AS A FAKE,

113
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,054
HIS OWN COMPANY, I.Y.S.,

114
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:46,883
ACCUSES BLACKPOOLE OF FRAUD.

115
00:06:46,883 --> 00:06:48,040
HE LOSES HIS COMPANY.

116
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,743
HE LOSES HIS MONEY.

117
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:50,845
HIS REPUTATION'S RUINED.

118
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:52,620
NOBODY WILL EVER WORK
WITH THIS GUY AGAIN.

119
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,299
ONLY ONE PROBLEM.

120
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:57,874
HE IS NOT GONNA BUY
THE FAKE DAVID

121
00:06:57,874 --> 00:07:00,130
UNTIL HE HAS IT VERIFIED
BY AN EXPERT.

122
00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:03,344
THAT'S RIGHT.

123
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,015
BY ONE OF US.

124
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:09,190
 AND HOW DO YOU
GUARANTEE THAT?

125
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:16,334
THE LONDON EXAMINER,
DATED JUST THREE DAYS AGO.

126
00:07:16,334 --> 00:07:17,314
IT LOOKS GENUINE.

127
00:07:17,314 --> 00:07:19,019
$8 MILLION.

128
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:20,896
I DON'T HAVE
THAT MUCH LIQUID.

129
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:21,996
SO SELL SOMETHING.

130
00:07:21,996 --> 00:07:24,509
SECOND DAVID WILL BE
IN THE COUNTRY TOMORROW

131
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:25,748
AND TOMORROW ONLY.

132
00:07:25,748 --> 00:07:26,348
YOU IN OR OUT?

133
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:27,820
'CAUSE I HAVE A CANADIAN OILMAN


134
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,260
THAT WANTS TO SLAP SOMETHING 
ON HIS MANTELPIECE.

135
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,556
-OILMAN?
-YES.

136
00:07:30,556 --> 00:07:32,347
WE'RE TALKING
A MISSING MICHEL ANGELO.

137
00:07:32,347 --> 00:07:34,194
IT'S PRACTICALLY
THE HOLY GRAIL.

138
00:07:34,194 --> 00:07:35,025
ARE YOU IN OR OUT?

139
00:07:35,025 --> 00:07:39,095
YOU MUST RETURN THIS ITEM
TO THE VATICAN MUSEUM IMMEDIATELY.

140
00:07:39,095 --> 00:07:40,847
LISTEN, LADY,
THE SHEIKH WHO OWNS THIS PIECE

141
00:07:40,847 --> 00:07:43,541
DOESN'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT
THE POPE, THE VAT-- ANYTHING.

142
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,634
SO, OF COURSE,
YOU COULD PAY,YOU KNOW,

143
00:07:45,634 --> 00:07:46,646
FIVE TIMES THE GOING RATE.

144
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:49,180
-LOOK, PORTIA, LET ME BUY IT.
-HERE WE GO.

145
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,195
I'LL BUY IT,
AND THEN AFTER MY DEATH,

146
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:52,545
I'LL DONATE IT
TO THE VATICAN.

147
00:07:52,545 --> 00:07:56,016
I MEAN, LET'S NOT GIVE THAT HEATHEN
A DIME MORE THAN HE NEEDS.

148
00:07:56,016 --> 00:07:59,068
I'M GONNA ASSUME
THAT THE HEATHEN ISN'T ME.

149
00:07:59,068 --> 00:08:01,205
WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS
OUT OF THE PAPERS.

150
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:02,325
OF COURSE.

151
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:06,595
I WANT OUR EXPERT,
PROFESSOR SINCLAIR,

152
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:07,957
TO DO THE VERIFICATION.

153
00:08:07,957 --> 00:08:11,841
NO ONE OUTSIDE OF THIS ROOM
CAN KNOW WE'RE CUTTING THIS DEAL.

154
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:12,977
AGREED.

155
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,696
ELIOT.

156
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:23,095
Eliot.

157
00:08:23,215 --> 00:08:24,055
WHAT?

158
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:26,670
GIVE ME A SECOND.
I'M HITTING IT OFF HERE.

159
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,555
Bring her along.

160
00:08:27,555 --> 00:08:28,985
IT'LL HELP SELL THE CHARACTER,

161
00:08:28,985 --> 00:08:30,290
BUT NOW -- DO IT NOW.

162
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,313
NATE.

163
00:08:32,872 --> 00:08:34,536
WHY DID YOU COME TO ME?

164
00:08:34,795 --> 00:08:36,927
WELL, I KNEW YOU'D PAY
THE BEST PRICE.

165
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:39,000
RENAISSANCE ART
IS YOUR LIFE.

166
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,786
GUILT WAS A BONUS.

167
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:41,922
-YOU HATE ME.
-YEAH.

168
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,723
OF COURSE I HATE YOU.

169
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:44,532
I MEAN, WHAT -- WHAT?

170
00:08:44,532 --> 00:08:45,860
YOU THINK IWANTTO BE HERE?

171
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,716
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE,
ALL RIGHT?!

172
00:08:47,716 --> 00:08:50,102
I'M DRUNK, I'M BROKE,
I'M LIVING OUT OF MY CAR,

173
00:08:50,102 --> 00:08:51,655
I JUST WANT THE PAYCHECK,

174
00:08:51,655 --> 00:08:53,734
AND AT THIS POINT, I DON'T CARE
WHERE IT COMES FROM.

175
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:54,885
NATE?

176
00:08:56,852 --> 00:08:57,884
MAGGIE.

177
00:08:59,308 --> 00:09:00,425
YOU GUYS --

178
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:01,521
YOU KNOW EACH OTHER?

179
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,121
OF COURSE.

180
00:09:03,732 --> 00:09:06,150
MAGGIE IS NATE'S EX-WIFE.

181
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:18,741
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?

182
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:20,395
GUYS, GUYS,

183
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:21,571
S- STAY IN CHARACTER.

184
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:22,883
NATE FORD.

185
00:09:22,883 --> 00:09:25,345
HI. ADAM SINCLAIR.

186
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:28,471
YEAH, MAGGIE HERE
IS, UH, MY EX-WIFE.

187
00:09:28,471 --> 00:09:29,442
YEAH.
CAUGHT THAT.

188
00:09:30,586 --> 00:09:32,777
THAT'S A MIGHTY FINE GRIP
YOU HAVE THERE, MR. FORD.

189
00:09:32,777 --> 00:09:34,818
SIGNORA FORD?

190
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:37,751
COLLINS.
I USE MY MAIDEN NAME.

191
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:39,263
OH.SCUSI.

192
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:43,534
DO YOU MIND IF I BORROW
PROFESSOR SINCLAIR FOR A MOMENT?

193
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:47,756
YES, UH, WE MUST TALK
WITH MR. BLACKPOOLE.

194
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:48,955
-GRAZIE.
-OF COURSE.

195
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,941
MAGGIE

196
00:09:49,942 --> 00:09:51,494
WHICH CONVERSATION
DO YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO?

197
00:09:51,494 --> 00:09:53,890
THAT'S WHAT STEREO
WAS INVENTED FOR.

198
00:09:54,906 --> 00:09:55,977
Why are you
working for him?

199
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:56,663
 I'm not.

200
00:09:56,664 --> 00:09:58,177
I'M UNDER CONTRACT
WITH THIS MUSEUM.

201
00:09:58,177 --> 00:10:00,137
I'M JUST HELPING HIM
SET UP HIS EXHIBIT.

202
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,337
NATE, I HEARD
WHAT YOU WERE SAYING BEFORE.

203
00:10:04,028 --> 00:10:06,319
I HAD NO IDEA
THINGS WERE SO AWFUL FOR YOU.

204
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:07,014
OH, NO, NO.
IT'S --

205
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:09,854
IN CHARACTER, NATE.
IN -- IN CHARACTER.

206
00:10:10,524 --> 00:10:11,732
THINGS GOT ROUGH.

207
00:10:12,204 --> 00:10:13,364
IT'S VERY HARD.

208
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:15,244
YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED ME.

209
00:10:15,244 --> 00:10:16,995
I- I WOULD HAVE
GIVEN YOU MONEY.

210
00:10:18,582 --> 00:10:19,882
SHE'S PRETTY.

211
00:10:20,756 --> 00:10:22,361
THEY MET
WHILE HE WORKED FOR ME.

212
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,376
MAGGIE'S AN ART EXPERT --

213
00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:26,263
HELPED HIM
TRACK DOWN FRAUD.

214
00:10:26,263 --> 00:10:29,663
QUITE A GLORIOUS PAIR FOR
A WHILE -- VERY NICK AND NORA.

215
00:10:29,715 --> 00:10:30,879
LOOKS REAL.

216
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,767
THERE'S A TECHNIQUE
THAT MICHELANGELO USES

217
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:34,879
WHEN HE WORKS WITH CLAY, AND...

218
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,167
I MEAN, I'D OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO
TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT IT,

219
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:39,675
BUT, YES, SIR.

220
00:10:39,675 --> 00:10:40,995
I DON'T NEED MONEY!

221
00:10:41,695 --> 00:10:43,038
-I --
-Nate!

222
00:10:43,038 --> 00:10:44,462
...NEED MONEY.

223
00:10:45,713 --> 00:10:47,213
I MEAN,
I JUST NEED THIS DEAL.

224
00:10:48,165 --> 00:10:50,061
WELL, THEN,
LET'S GO GET IT.

225
00:10:56,535 --> 00:10:57,782
WHAT'S NATE HERE FOR?

226
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,246
IT'S AN ART SALE,
BUT PRIVATE.

227
00:11:00,246 --> 00:11:01,621
I'LL VERIFY THE ART.

228
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:02,998
SCUSI.

229
00:11:02,998 --> 00:11:04,343
NO. WE AGREED --

230
00:11:04,343 --> 00:11:05,783
-NO OUTSIDE PEOPLE.
-NO, NO, NO.

231
00:11:05,783 --> 00:11:07,784
NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

232
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:10,869
I- I'VE BEEN
A LITTLE HESITANT.

233
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:13,245
NO OFFENSE,
BUT I DON'T KNOW YOU THAT WELL.

234
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:14,468
BUT YOU KNOW ME.

235
00:11:14,468 --> 00:11:15,644
YOU KNOW MY REPUTATION.

236
00:11:15,644 --> 00:11:17,790
IF MY PRESENCE WILL HELP YOU
CLOSE THE DEAL, THEN I'M IN.

237
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,774
AGREED.

238
00:11:18,774 --> 00:11:20,133
MY ONE CONDITION.

239
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:22,322
MAGGIE EXAMINES THE SCULPTURE,

240
00:11:22,322 --> 00:11:23,938
OR I WALK.

241
00:11:25,312 --> 00:11:26,520
AGREED.

242
00:11:26,897 --> 00:11:27,634
GREAT.

243
00:11:27,635 --> 00:11:28,739
I'll get some drinks.

244
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:30,554
WE'LL CELEBRATE.

245
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,713
I'LL, UH, I'LL HELP YOU,
SIGNORE FORD.

246
00:11:34,713 --> 00:11:36,216
Now, Nate...

247
00:11:36,216 --> 00:11:38,505
IS MAGGIE A VERYGOOD
ART INSPECTOR?

248
00:11:38,505 --> 00:11:40,986
-YEAH, SHE'S THE BEST.
-NO, NO, NO,

249
00:11:40,986 --> 00:11:43,897
WE CAN'T LET YOUR EX-WIFE
ANYWHERE NEAR OUR LITTLE NAKED MAN.

250
00:11:43,897 --> 00:11:45,939
WE HAVE TO SHOW HER
THE REAL THING.

251
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:49,267
WE HAVE TO STEAL
THE FIRST DAVID RIGHT NOW

252
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:51,962
SO WE CAN SHOW IT TO MAGGIE
TOMORROW AS THE SECOND DAVID.

253
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,129
THAT'S TOO RISKY.

254
00:11:54,204 --> 00:11:55,700
BLACKPOOLE KNOWS OUR FACES.

255
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,524
WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET HIM
ON THE HOOK LIKE THIS AGAIN.

256
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:00,671
YOU HONESTLY THINK THAT WE CAN
FOOL MAGGIE WITH A FAKE?

257
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:01,344
NO.

258
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:03,969
SHE'S TOO SMART
AND TOO EXPERIENCED.

259
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,418
WHEN WE WORKED TOGETHER,

260
00:12:05,418 --> 00:12:07,123
THERE WAS NOBODY BETTER.

261
00:12:07,123 --> 00:12:09,875
A SIMPLE "NO" WITHOUT THE
CHEERLEADING WOULD HAVE DONE.

262
00:12:10,675 --> 00:12:12,642
THIS DOES COMPLICATE THINGS.

263
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,150
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, ONE CRIS AT A TIME.

264
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,325
-PARKER, GET IN HERE.
-NO, NO.

265
00:12:17,325 --> 00:12:18,987
NATE, WE HAVEN'T DONE ANY PREP.

266
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:20,275
WE DON'T HAVE OUR TOOLS.

267
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:22,440
YOU WANT ME TO BREAK INTO
A SECURE STORAGE FACILITY

268
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,746
WITH WHATEVER I CAN SCROUNGE UP
AT THE BUFFET TABLE?

269
00:12:24,746 --> 00:12:26,588
PRETTY MUCH, YEAH.

270
00:12:28,145 --> 00:12:28,966
COOL.

271
00:12:29,545 --> 00:12:31,576
I THINK SOPHIE LEFT
SOME DRESSES IN HERE.

272
00:12:33,973 --> 00:12:34,803
I'LL GO, TOO.

273
00:12:34,803 --> 00:12:36,778
I, UH, I GOT A WHITE SHIRT.

274
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:38,378
I CAN GO WAITSTAFF.

275
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:57,927
GLASS OF ICE, PLEASE.

276
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:01,982
I NEED A BIG ROLL
OF ALUMINUM FOIL.

277
00:13:03,586 --> 00:13:05,156
UH, UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?

278
00:13:05,156 --> 00:13:06,116
I'M GONNA JUST --

279
00:13:06,116 --> 00:13:08,115
I'M GONNA WRAP UP SOME
OF THESE SHRIMP FOR TOMORROW.

280
00:13:08,115 --> 00:13:10,180
-BREAKFAST JAMBALAYA, YOU KNOW.
-ALL RIGHT.

281
00:13:11,868 --> 00:13:13,339
I GOT IT.
NOW WHAT?

282
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:14,642
I need dark eye shadow.

283
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,810
I ASSUME
SHE'S TALKING TO YOU.

284
00:13:17,434 --> 00:13:18,650
SCUSI.

285
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:21,177
I MUST GO POWDER MY NOSE.

286
00:13:26,912 --> 00:13:28,207
DOOR'S GOT A SILENT ALARM.

287
00:13:28,445 --> 00:13:29,524
YOU SHOULD HIDE.

288
00:13:29,524 --> 00:13:30,900
WE SHOULD PRETEND
TO MAKE OUT.

289
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,700
MAKE WHAT?

290
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,409
LET'S TALK ABOUT --
A LITTLE BIT --

291
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:43,992
OKA-- OH.

292
00:13:48,784 --> 00:13:49,751
YOU, UH,

293
00:13:50,108 --> 00:13:51,398
BUMPED THE DOOR THERE.

294
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:53,364
-SETS THE ALARM OFF.
-YOU KNOW WHAT?

295
00:13:53,364 --> 00:13:54,283
WE --

296
00:13:54,283 --> 00:13:55,942
-YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.
-SORRY.

297
00:14:01,693 --> 00:14:02,579
Makeup.

298
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:04,856
Come on.

299
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,209
CAN WE TALK
ABOUT THE PRETENDING?

300
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:07,728
THAT WAS NICE.

301
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:16,207
EYE SHADOW.

302
00:14:18,469 --> 00:14:21,364
UM, CAN WE TALK
ABOUT WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

303
00:14:21,364 --> 00:14:22,515
WEIRD, HUH?

304
00:14:22,515 --> 00:14:24,115
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

305
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:26,792
NATE'S EX-WIFE
COMING OUT OF NOWHERE.

306
00:14:28,172 --> 00:14:29,830
YEAH.
NO, NO, THAT'S --

307
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,719
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT AT ALL.

308
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:42,983
CHEW SOME GUM.

309
00:14:43,943 --> 00:14:45,226
IS MY BREATH FUNKY?

310
00:14:48,243 --> 00:14:50,170
WHICH ONE OF YOU
DID SHE KISS?

311
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:55,473
T-1300 MAKASHITA.

312
00:14:56,248 --> 00:14:57,643
WE GOT ABOUT 10 SECONDS,

313
00:14:57,643 --> 00:14:58,682
EVEN IN THE BLIND SPOT,

314
00:14:58,682 --> 00:14:59,882
BEFORE IT PICKS UP
OUR BODY HEAT.

315
00:14:59,882 --> 00:15:01,257
STICK YOUR GUM IN HERE.

316
00:15:04,088 --> 00:15:05,405
HA HA! GOTCHA.

317
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:09,219
YEAH, CAN'T PICK UP OUR HEAT
THROUGH THE ICE.

318
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,491
NICE.

319
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:22,848
PARKER, PARKER, WHAT ARE YOU --

320
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:23,889
NO, NO, NO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

321
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,687
THIS SYSTEM RESETS IN LIKE FIVE
MINUTES. YOU KNOW WHAT?

322
00:15:26,687 --> 00:15:28,152
OKAY, I WANT YOU TO KNOW,

323
00:15:28,152 --> 00:15:29,521
IF YOU SET OFF THE LASERS,

324
00:15:29,521 --> 00:15:30,612
I'M RUNNING LIKE A BAT
OUT OF HELL.

325
00:15:30,612 --> 00:15:31,964
I PRAY YOU CAN KEEP UP --

326
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,139
JUST SAYING.

327
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:34,314
WHAT ARE YOU --

328
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:37,198
PARK-- S--

329
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,813
YOU'RE BENDING THE BEAMS BACK.

330
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:45,854
SWEET.

331
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:03,258
YOU DID NOT JUST THINK ABOUT THIS
ON THE WAY IN FROM THE VAN.

332
00:16:03,258 --> 00:16:04,732
SOME PEOPLE
DO CROSSWORDS.

333
00:16:09,006 --> 00:16:10,018
We're almost done.

334
00:16:10,995 --> 00:16:14,062
I JUST WISH WE COULD TALK
WITHOUT IT BEING SO HARD.

335
00:16:14,062 --> 00:16:15,790
Nate, did you hear me? I just said
we're almost done.

336
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,895
YEAH!
I HEAR YOU ALREADY!

337
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,855
I'M SORRY.

338
00:16:17,855 --> 00:16:18,735
OH, NO, NO, NO.
I --

339
00:16:18,735 --> 00:16:22,586
I JUST -- I'M JUST TRYING
TO TELL YOU THAT I STILL CARE.

340
00:16:22,586 --> 00:16:25,545
-NO, I-I WAS --
-CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU,

341
00:16:25,545 --> 00:16:26,465
I MEAN.

342
00:16:27,193 --> 00:16:29,369
I'VE NEVER STOPPED CARING
ABOUT YOU, NATE.

343
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:30,577
GREAT!

344
00:16:35,805 --> 00:16:37,196
SCUSI.

345
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,531
MY ENGLISH IS, UH...

346
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:42,246
GREAT OPPORTUNITIES
LIKE THIS --

347
00:16:42,246 --> 00:16:46,734
THEY -- THEY -- THEY...
THEY COME ALONG VERY RARELY.

348
00:16:47,225 --> 00:16:48,861
GET IT OVER WITH.

349
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:52,451
READY?

350
00:17:01,081 --> 00:17:02,049
COME ON, COME ON.

351
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:18,374
HEY, THE VIBRATION ALARM JUST WENT OFF
IN THE RESTORATION ROOM.

352
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:21,476
NO, WAIT.

353
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:24,419
LOOK. THE CAR ALARMS ALL
WENT OFF IN THE PARKING LOT.

354
00:17:24,907 --> 00:17:26,355
LITTLE EARTHQUAKES.

355
00:17:26,355 --> 00:17:28,521
JUST ANOTHER TREMOR.

356
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:29,961
GEEZ.

357
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,142
YOU DON'T THROW THE DAVID.

358
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:40,519
YOU CAUGHT IT, DIDN'T YOU?

359
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,625
YOU'RE CRAZY.

360
00:17:42,198 --> 00:17:43,193
I SHOULD GO.

361
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,065
NATE...

362
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,992
JUST KNOW
THAT I'M HERE FOR YOU.

363
00:17:51,975 --> 00:17:53,672
DO YOU NEED A PLACE TO STAY,
OR --

364
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:54,576
I'M OKAY.

365
00:17:54,889 --> 00:17:56,495
MY OFFICE HAS A COUCH.

366
00:18:02,087 --> 00:18:02,904
ADAM!

367
00:18:03,268 --> 00:18:04,318
UH, YEAH?

368
00:18:05,027 --> 00:18:06,315
LET ME GIVE YOU
MY NUMBER.

369
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:08,715
GREAT.

370
00:18:10,602 --> 00:18:12,643
I'M SORRY YOUR WIFE GAVE ME
 HER PHONE NUMBER.

371
00:18:12,643 --> 00:18:14,691
- DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
-IT WAS ONLY TO COORDINATE

372
00:18:14,691 --> 00:18:16,694
-WHERE WE WERE GONNA GO.
-NOT TALKING ABOUT IT.

373
00:18:16,694 --> 00:18:19,207
WE JUST STOLE
AN $8 MILLION STATUE

374
00:18:19,207 --> 00:18:20,791
ON, LIKE, OUR DAY OFF!

375
00:18:21,741 --> 00:18:23,612
YEAH, AND WE'RE
GIVING IT BACK.

376
00:18:23,612 --> 00:18:25,795
TECHNICALLY,
WE'RE SELLING IT BACK.

377
00:18:25,795 --> 00:18:28,994
DOESN'T IT SEEM LIKE
THERE MIGHT BE A BETTER WAY?

378
00:18:28,994 --> 00:18:31,250
I MEAN, LET'S JUST
THINK ABOUT IT, HUH?

379
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,881
WHAT IF BOTH OF BLACKPOOLE'S
STATUES WERE FAKE, RIGHT?

380
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,389
IT WOULD BE EVEN WORSE FOR HIM.

381
00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:38,548
THE DAVID HE'S HAD ON DISPLAY
FOR YEARS,

382
00:18:38,548 --> 00:18:42,192
INSURED AND VERIFIED BY I.Y.S.

383
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:45,657
WAIT, EVERY SALE HE'S MADE
IN THE LAST 10 YEARS

384
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,407
WOULD HAVE TO BE AUDITED.

385
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,023
HE WOULDN'T JUST LOSE
HIS COMPANY.

386
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:53,109
HIS OWN BOARD OF DIRECTORS
WOULD SUE HIM.

387
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,297
THIS GUY WOULD TOTALLY
BE RUINED.

388
00:18:59,591 --> 00:19:01,368
I'D LIKE TO HAVE A WORD
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

389
00:19:08,042 --> 00:19:09,517
THAT AIN'T GOOD.

390
00:19:12,349 --> 00:19:14,304
I KNOW THAT VOICE. THAT'S
THE VOICE YOU USE ON A MARK.

391
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:15,702
I CAN THINK
OF A DOZEN OTHER TIMES

392
00:19:15,702 --> 00:19:17,478
AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THIS
LANDS IN OUR LAPS.

393
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:19,656
-WE TAKE IT!
-YOU DON'T CON US.

394
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:21,344
YOU DON'T CON YOUR OWN TEAM.

395
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:22,358
YOU'RE JUST GETTING
COLD FEET

396
00:19:22,358 --> 00:19:24,638
BECAUSE YOUR EX-WIFE
COULD BLOW IT FOR US!

397
00:19:24,638 --> 00:19:25,270
OH, MAGGIE --

398
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,058
-MAGGIE WOULDN'T.
-MAGGIE, WHO WORKS FOR THE MAN

399
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:28,610
WHO LET YOUR SON DIE?

400
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,022
SHE DOESN'T HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT!

401
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:31,078
SHE DOESN'T KNOW!

402
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,267
SHE DOESN'T KNOW

403
00:19:35,987 --> 00:19:37,348
THAT I.Y.S...

404
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:41,104
AND BLACKPOOLE
DENIED SAM'S TREATMENT.

405
00:19:41,104 --> 00:19:43,050
HOW CAN SHE NOT KNOW?

406
00:19:55,315 --> 00:19:56,840
SHE DOESN'T KNOW...

407
00:19:58,566 --> 00:19:59,890
BECAUSE I NEVER TOLD HER.

408
00:20:01,773 --> 00:20:03,191
SHE PITIES ME.

409
00:20:04,106 --> 00:20:05,517
DIDN'T YOU SEE THAT?

410
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:17,171
YOU'RE LYING TO HER, NATE.

411
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:18,762
YOU'RE NOT WHO SHE THINKS
YOU ARE.

412
00:20:18,762 --> 00:20:20,609
SHE THINKS I'M A DRUNK --

413
00:20:21,376 --> 00:20:22,784
MAYBE EVEN A CRIMINAL.

414
00:20:22,784 --> 00:20:24,975
YOU'RE STILL AN HONEST MAN,
NATE.

415
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:28,077
IT'S THE REST OF THE WORLD
THAT'S GONE CROOKED.

416
00:20:30,707 --> 00:20:32,263
DO YOU WANT TO
WALK AWAY?

417
00:20:33,243 --> 00:20:36,673
HOW MANY OTHER KIDS DIED
JUST LIKE SAM

418
00:20:36,673 --> 00:20:40,332
BECAUSE THIS BASTARD PUT HIS
PROFITS ABOVE THEIR TREATMENT?

419
00:20:40,332 --> 00:20:41,738
HOW MANY?

420
00:20:41,738 --> 00:20:45,401
AND IT'S NOT JUST ME
AND SAM.

421
00:20:46,552 --> 00:20:49,182
I MEAN, THAT IS
WHAT I KEEP TELLING MYSELF.

422
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:03,163
ALWAYS YOUR FATAL FLAW.

423
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:05,180
YOU THINK TOO MUCH.

424
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:11,404
THERE'S THAT VOICE AGAIN.

425
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:23,847
HARDISON.

426
00:21:25,175 --> 00:21:26,878
THREE MINUTES
BEFORE THEY ARRIVE.

427
00:21:26,878 --> 00:21:28,027
Gotcha, boss.

428
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:33,483
NO. WHOA.

429
00:21:33,483 --> 00:21:35,884
WHOA. WHERE IN THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?

430
00:21:35,884 --> 00:21:37,029
I- I'M SORRY?

431
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,872
YOU ARE THE PILOT
FOR THIS PLANE, RIGHT?

432
00:21:38,872 --> 00:21:40,577
YEAH, UH, RIGHT.

433
00:21:40,577 --> 00:21:41,672
WELL, THEN,
GET BACK ON THAT BIRD.

434
00:21:41,672 --> 00:21:43,055
WE GOT WORK TO DO.

435
00:21:43,055 --> 00:21:45,822
UH, WORK? W- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

436
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:47,374
SPOT INSPECTION.
FAA.

437
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:50,436
NOW, LOOK, I WANT TO SEE
THIS PLANE'S TCAS, VRSM,

438
00:21:50,436 --> 00:21:52,540
AND 8.1 FM SPACING
IN OPERATION

439
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,763
TO MAKE SURE
IT'S FULLY FUNCTIONAL

440
00:21:53,763 --> 00:21:55,809
AND IN COMPLIANCE
WITH THE NEW FAA REGULATIONS.

441
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:57,649
NEW REGULATIONS?

442
00:21:58,506 --> 00:22:03,888
-PILOT UNAWARE OF LATEST REGULATIONS.
-OH, THE NEW REGULATIONS.OF COURSE.

443
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:06,424
PLEASE, COME THIS WAY.
I'LL TAKE YOU RIGHT UP.

444
00:22:06,424 --> 00:22:08,967
OH, NO, NO. IT'S COOL, IT'S
COOL. I DON'T NEED TO GO UP.

445
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:11,974
JUST TAXI ME
AROUND THE BUILDING.

446
00:22:11,974 --> 00:22:15,234
TAXI? I THOUGHT YOU NEED
TO GET UP IN THE AIR.

447
00:22:15,977 --> 00:22:19,496
UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH BLACK AUTHORITY FIGURES.

448
00:22:19,496 --> 00:22:20,560
SIR, PLEASE DON'T
WRITE THAT.

449
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,311
OH, I WILL WRITE A LETTER
TO YOUR MA IF I FEEL LIKE IT.

450
00:22:23,311 --> 00:22:25,583
THIS WAY, PLEASE.
IT'S IN ORDER. I-I PROMISE.

451
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:26,662
THIS WAY.
IT'S OKAY.

452
00:22:27,582 --> 00:22:28,918
FAA -- HE'S A HARD-ASS.

453
00:22:28,918 --> 00:22:30,342
**
LET'S GO.

454
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,819
WE'RE UP.

455
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,952
-HEY.
-HELLO.

456
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:47,996
-ADAM.
-**

457
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:50,850
AN INTERESTING PLACE
TO MEET.

458
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,956
NATHAN FORD?

459
00:22:51,956 --> 00:22:52,893
YEAH?

460
00:22:53,341 --> 00:22:56,882
I'VE GOT A CALL HERE FROM FLIGHT
7- TANGO-8-2, INBOUND FROM DUBAI.

461
00:22:56,882 --> 00:22:58,238
THEY'D LIKE TO KNOW
IF YOUR PARTY'S HERE.

462
00:22:58,238 --> 00:22:59,373
YES, WE'RE ALL HERE.

463
00:22:59,373 --> 00:23:00,317
WHERE ARE THEY?

464
00:23:00,317 --> 00:23:01,734
THEY'RE JUST
PULLING IN NOW.

465
00:23:32,934 --> 00:23:34,007
AS-SALAAMU ALAYKUM.

466
00:23:34,251 --> 00:23:35,756
ALAYKUM AS-SALAAMU.

467
00:23:37,998 --> 00:23:40,113
I'M ONLY CLEARED
FOR REFUELING.

468
00:23:40,113 --> 00:23:42,462
WE MUST RESOLVE THIS
BEFORE YOUR CUSTOMS MEN REALIZE

469
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,844
I'VE GOTTEN OFF THE PLANE.

470
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,692
WHY ARE YOU SELLING THIS?

471
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:50,858
I HAVE CERTAIN DEBTS
MY FATHER DOES NOT APPROVE OF.

472
00:23:51,523 --> 00:23:54,272
THERE ARE VERY SHARP
CARD PLAYERS IN LONDON.

473
00:23:55,326 --> 00:23:56,688
IT IS FROM
MY FATHER'S COLLECTION.

474
00:23:56,688 --> 00:23:57,904
IT WILL NOT BE MISSED.

475
00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:00,248
AND IF IT IS, UH...

476
00:24:00,727 --> 00:24:04,358
MY SECURITY WILL FIND
SOME GUILTY PARTY TO BLAME.

477
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,932
THEY ARE VERY EFFICIENT
THAT WAY.

478
00:24:07,367 --> 00:24:08,267
IAN?

479
00:24:10,146 --> 00:24:11,362
I SAY YES.

480
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:14,969
I MEAN, THERE WILL BE
OTHER TESTS REQUIRED, BUT...

481
00:24:17,693 --> 00:24:18,671
MAGGIE?

482
00:24:20,223 --> 00:24:22,639
IT'S A DEAD RINGER
FOR THE FIRST DAVID YOU OWN,

483
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,301
CAST OFF THE SAME MOLD.

484
00:24:33,865 --> 00:24:35,175
IT'S REAL.

485
00:24:46,515 --> 00:24:47,731
WHERE'D THE GIRL GO?

486
00:24:48,802 --> 00:24:49,763
MAGGIE,

487
00:24:49,763 --> 00:24:51,124
WHAT YOU DID BACK THERE --

488
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:53,108
WAS SO MUCH FUN.

489
00:24:53,108 --> 00:24:54,872
WORKING TOGETHER AGAIN.

490
00:24:54,872 --> 00:24:59,342
IT WAS JUST LIKE OLD TIMES,
WHEN I'D HELP YOU GET YOUR STOLEN ART BACK.

491
00:25:00,316 --> 00:25:01,439
IT FELT...

492
00:25:02,847 --> 00:25:03,949
FAMILIAR.

493
00:25:05,685 --> 00:25:06,800
CALL ME.

494
00:25:09,782 --> 00:25:10,885
No.

495
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,291
PORTIA!

496
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:24,102
GOOD NEWS, HUH?

497
00:25:24,102 --> 00:25:27,342
WHEN THE VATICAN LEARNED
ABOUT YOUR GENEROUS OFFER

498
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:29,197
TO DONATE THE DAVID
AFTER YOUR DEATH,

499
00:25:29,197 --> 00:25:32,627
THEY AGREED TO LEND EVERYTHING YOU REQUESTED
FOR YOUR EXHIBITION.

500
00:25:32,627 --> 00:25:34,753
OH, YOU WON'T
REGRET THIS, PORTIA.

501
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:37,600
WITH THE TWO DAVIDS AS
THE CENTERPIECE FOR MY EXHIBIT,

502
00:25:38,015 --> 00:25:39,673
THIS IS GONNA BE
THE FINEST COLLECTION

503
00:25:39,673 --> 00:25:41,601
EVER SHOWN TO THE PUBLIC.

504
00:25:42,645 --> 00:25:45,280
I CAN HONESTLY SAY
I CANNOT WAIT.

505
00:25:59,939 --> 00:26:01,147
FEEL BETTER?

506
00:26:02,023 --> 00:26:03,339
ACTUALLY, YEAH.

507
00:26:15,451 --> 00:26:16,839
WAS THAT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY?

508
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:18,716
HE WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED
A HANDSHAKE.

509
00:26:19,922 --> 00:26:20,898
AND IT FELT GOOD.

510
00:26:22,093 --> 00:26:23,256
HARDISON, WHERE ARE YOU?

511
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,256
HALFWAY HOME ALREADY, NATE.

512
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:31,150
You got it?

513
00:26:31,274 --> 00:26:33,038
I'VE GOT THE MONEY
RIGHT HERE.

514
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:04,072
I'M GONNA COUNT TO THREE.

515
00:27:07,989 --> 00:27:08,804
NATE, WE'RE BLOWN.

516
00:27:08,804 --> 00:27:09,996
W--

517
00:27:18,531 --> 00:27:19,698
THAT RIB'S BROKEN.

518
00:27:23,802 --> 00:27:25,745
HE SAID YOU'D BE TOUGHER
THAN THIS.

519
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:39,016
LET'S GO.

520
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:47,770
TAKE HIM.

521
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:58,290
THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT.

522
00:29:02,213 --> 00:29:03,249
YOU GETTING TIRED, BOY?

523
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:08,630
BETTER KEEP THAT LEFT UP.

524
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,547
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK WE'VE
EVER BEEN PROPERLY INTRODUCED.

525
00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:38,832
HELLO, PARKER.

526
00:29:39,337 --> 00:29:40,763
JIM STERLING.

527
00:29:45,388 --> 00:29:46,933
WHY WON'T YOU GO DOWN?

528
00:30:00,718 --> 00:30:02,355
THAT RIB'S BROKEN.


529
00:30:08,412 --> 00:30:10,559
NATE, WE'RE BLOWN.
WE'RE BLOWN.

530
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:12,737
Nate...

531
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:14,807
ELIOT, WHAT'S GOING ON?

532
00:30:14,807 --> 00:30:16,280
TALK TO ME, ELIOT.

533
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,454
Hello, Nate.

534
00:30:20,203 --> 00:30:21,558
LOVE THIS TECHNOLOGY.

535
00:30:22,117 --> 00:30:23,726
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
STERLING?

536
00:30:23,726 --> 00:30:25,293
Well, first,
let's see how many birds

537
00:30:25,293 --> 00:30:26,893
WE HAVE IN HAND.

538
00:30:26,893 --> 00:30:27,941
YOU KNOW THIS IS PARKER'S.

539
00:30:27,941 --> 00:30:29,558
NOW, ALEC HARDISON?

540
00:30:29,558 --> 00:30:31,231
ACCOUNTED FOR,
MR. STERLING.

541
00:30:31,231 --> 00:30:33,708
AND WE HAVE
THE CASH, TOO.

542
00:30:35,591 --> 00:30:37,727
Marvelous.
MR. SPENCER?

543
00:30:41,099 --> 00:30:42,366
HEY, STERLING.

544
00:30:42,575 --> 00:30:44,909
I GOT SOME DENTAL WORK
WITH YOUR NAME ON IT.

545
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:47,805
WHAT DO YOU SAY ME AND YOU
HOOK UP SO I CAN GIVE IT TO YOU?

546
00:30:48,512 --> 00:30:52,647
SEEMS THAT MR. QUINN WAS NOT
QUITE AS EFFECTIVE AS PROMISED.

547
00:30:52,647 --> 00:30:56,439
STILL, TWO BIRDS IN THE HAND
ARE WORTH THREE IN THE BUSH.

548
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:57,686
Eliot, stay low.

549
00:30:57,686 --> 00:31:00,326
STERLING,
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

550
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:01,614
TELL YOU WHAT --

551
00:31:01,614 --> 00:31:05,902
WHY DON'T YOU MEET ME IN THE PLACE WHERE 
WE USED TO GO FOR A DRINK AFTER WORK?

552
00:31:05,902 --> 00:31:07,333
I'LL COME ALONE.

553
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:08,937
I PROMISE.

554
00:31:22,167 --> 00:31:24,049
DO YOU REMBER
WHEN WE WERE FRIENDS?

555
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,689
AFTER WORK,
WE USED TO COME UP HERE,

556
00:31:25,689 --> 00:31:27,361
HAVE A DRINK,
WATCH THE SUN SET.

557
00:31:27,361 --> 00:31:29,152
WE WERE NEVER FRIENDS,
STERLING.

558
00:31:29,552 --> 00:31:31,272
SO THE ANSWER TO MY QUESTION
WOULD BE NO, THEN.

559
00:31:31,272 --> 00:31:32,727
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

560
00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:33,709
A TRADE.

561
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:34,870
-NO.
-COME ON.

562
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,260
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

563
00:31:36,732 --> 00:31:38,755
I JUST WANT
THE SECOND DAVID.

564
00:31:39,827 --> 00:31:41,042
WELL, YOU GOT IT.

565
00:31:41,042 --> 00:31:41,935
IT'S ON THE TRUCK.

566
00:31:41,935 --> 00:31:43,289
PARKER COULDN'T MAKE
THE SWITCH.

567
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:44,970
NOT THE FIRST DAVID,

568
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:47,007
THE SECOND DAVID.

569
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:48,828
10 YEARS AGO,
I WAS THE INVESTIGATOR

570
00:31:48,828 --> 00:31:50,715
WHEN IT WENT MISSING
FROM THE VATICAN.

571
00:31:50,715 --> 00:31:52,891
-I WANT IT.
-WELL, I DON'T HAVE IT.

572
00:31:52,891 --> 00:31:54,075
OF COURSE YOU DO.

573
00:31:54,075 --> 00:31:56,274
JUST ASK YOURSELF
ONE QUESTION.

574
00:31:57,084 --> 00:32:01,012
WHO CAME UP WITH THE PLAN
TO BREAK IAN BLACKPOOLE?

575
00:32:11,557 --> 00:32:14,209
I KNEW YOU'D COME
AFTER BLACKPOOLE EVENTUALLY.

576
00:32:14,209 --> 00:32:15,611
YOU HAD TO.

577
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,769
AND WHEN YOU DID,

578
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,545
I KNEW THAT THE WAY IN WOULD
HAVE TO BE THE FIRST DAVID.

579
00:32:21,545 --> 00:32:23,409
SHE WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO RESIST.

580
00:32:24,046 --> 00:32:25,286
IT'S HOW SHE THINKS.

581
00:32:26,317 --> 00:32:27,854
IT'S HOW YOU THINK.

582
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:31,526
AND I KNOW HOW YOU THINK.

583
00:32:32,581 --> 00:32:33,934
COME ON, JENNY.

584
00:32:34,797 --> 00:32:35,844
MAKE IT OFFICIAL.

585
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,867
IT'S THE NAME SHE WAS USING
BACK THEN.

586
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:41,266
MIGHT BE HER REAL NAME
FOR ALL I KNOW.

587
00:32:41,266 --> 00:32:43,578
I'VE NO IDEA.

588
00:32:50,715 --> 00:32:53,823
I STOLE THE SECOND DAVID
10 YEARS AGO.

589
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,846
I STILL HAVE IT.

590
00:32:59,425 --> 00:33:01,347
SEE? THERE YOU GO.
WASN'T SO HARD, WAS IT?

591
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,989
ALL RIGHT,
I WANT THE SECOND DAVID HERE,

592
00:33:04,989 --> 00:33:07,171
THIS SPOT, NO TRICKS,

593
00:33:07,171 --> 00:33:08,362
END OF DAY.

594
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:13,032
I'LL BRING IT.

595
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,015
NO.

596
00:33:14,015 --> 00:33:16,483
I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I DON'T TRUST
THE TWO OF YOU TOGETHER.

597
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:20,953
SO, YOU WILL GO MEET MY MEN
AT YOUR OFFICES,

598
00:33:20,953 --> 00:33:22,719
WHERE I KNOW
YOU'LL BE SAFE AND SOUND,

599
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:24,479
AND SOPHIE WILL BRING ME
THE SECOND DAVID,

600
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:26,964
WHICH I WILL EXCHANGE
FOR PARKER.

601
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:29,628
AFTER ALL, SHE STOLE IT.

602
00:33:29,628 --> 00:33:31,162
HOW ELSE
IS SHE GONNA LEARN?

603
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,426
HOW MUCH IS IN HERE?

604
00:34:15,777 --> 00:34:17,545
AS MUCH AS I NEED.

605
00:34:21,968 --> 00:34:24,030
WHEN YOU FOUND ME
IN CHICAGO,

606
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,602
I TOLD YOU I'D BECOME
AN HONEST CITIZEN.

607
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,154
I WAS JUST
AN HONEST CITIZEN...

608
00:34:32,129 --> 00:34:34,403
WITH A VERY GOOD
RETIREMENT PLAN.

609
00:34:43,151 --> 00:34:45,235
SO WHY THE HELL DIDN'T YOU
SAY SOMETHING THAT NIGHT?

610
00:34:45,235 --> 00:34:47,025
OH, WHEN YOU WERE STANDING
NEXT TO YOUR EX-WIFE?

611
00:34:47,025 --> 00:34:48,497
YOU WERE
IN NO CONDITION --

612
00:34:48,497 --> 00:34:50,536
YEAH, SO, THIS WHOLE SCAM
TO BURN IAN

613
00:34:50,536 --> 00:34:52,816
WAS BASICALLY TO GET YOUR HANDS
ON THE FIRST DAVID,

614
00:34:52,816 --> 00:34:53,855
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, JENNY?

615
00:34:54,272 --> 00:34:57,856
DON'T YOU DARE PRETEND
THIS HAS BEEN A SELFLESS CRUSADE ON YOUR PART!

616
00:34:57,856 --> 00:35:00,318
IT WASN'T A COINCIDENCE
THAT YOU SET UP OUR OFFICES

617
00:35:00,318 --> 00:35:01,886
IN THE SAME CITY
AS BLACKPOOLE.

618
00:35:01,886 --> 00:35:04,912
YOU KNEW ONE DAY
YOU'D GO AFTER HIM AND YOU'D USE US.

619
00:35:04,912 --> 00:35:06,651
YES. WELL, I WAS RIGHT, WASN'T I?

620
00:35:06,651 --> 00:35:09,282
THAT IS THE VOICE
YOU USE FOR A MARK.

621
00:35:10,681 --> 00:35:12,130
I MEANT IT, NATE.

622
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,499
GOING AFTER BLACKPOOLE.

623
00:35:15,499 --> 00:35:17,386
I WANTED TO HURT HIM --

624
00:35:17,753 --> 00:35:19,553
FOR THE WAY
HE'D HURT YOU.

625
00:35:20,112 --> 00:35:21,680
BUT I'M A THIEF.

626
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:26,110
AND STEALING BOTH DAVIDS...

627
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:30,941
...NO ONE'S EVER DONE THAT,
NOT IN 400 YEARS.

628
00:35:30,941 --> 00:35:33,676
AND THERE IT WAS
IN FRONT OF ME, AND...

629
00:35:33,676 --> 00:35:36,108
AND STEALING
THE FIRST DAVID HELPED YOU,

630
00:35:36,108 --> 00:35:41,208
AND IT WAS...
I DON'T KNOW.

631
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:44,264
IT WAS LIKE IT WAS MEANT TO BE.

632
00:35:45,547 --> 00:35:49,324
-WE'RE BOTH ADDICTS.
-WE'RE ALL ADDICTS, NATE.

633
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,641
WE'RE ALL ADDICTED
TO OUR PASTS.

634
00:35:54,641 --> 00:35:56,783
DON'T TELL ME
YOU WEREN'T TEMPTED

635
00:35:56,783 --> 00:35:58,533
WHEN YOU WERE TALKING
TO MAGGIE.

636
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:01,646
YOU WANTED TO FEEL
HOW IT USED TO FEEL.

637
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,878
YOU STILL THINK OF US
AS JUST CRIMINALS.

638
00:36:09,907 --> 00:36:11,302
THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE
A PART OF YOU

639
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:13,582
THAT THINKS
YOU'RE BETTER THAN US.

640
00:36:22,649 --> 00:36:24,349
WHERE DO WE GO
FROM HERE?

641
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:29,187
WE DO THIS.

642
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,275
STERLING KNOWS US.

643
00:36:33,263 --> 00:36:35,138
HE KNOWS HOW WE THINK.

644
00:36:35,138 --> 00:36:37,222
SO WE THINK
LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE.

645
00:36:50,948 --> 00:36:53,476
YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO SEE IT,
STERLING.

646
00:36:59,402 --> 00:37:01,737
PARKER COMES
TO THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOF.

647
00:37:01,737 --> 00:37:03,368
WE CIRCLE HER.

648
00:37:03,582 --> 00:37:06,378
YOU GET TO THE DAVID
WHEN I GET TO THE DOOR.

649
00:37:06,378 --> 00:37:09,853
PARKER COMES TO ME,
AND WE'RE GONE.

650
00:37:19,141 --> 00:37:20,240
WE'VE GOT HIM.

651
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,214
BOYS.

652
00:37:27,544 --> 00:37:28,712
YEAH, HE'S HERE.

653
00:37:28,712 --> 00:37:29,894
Put him on.

654
00:37:29,894 --> 00:37:30,865
OKAY.

655
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,033
TELL YOUR GUYS
TO CUT HARDISON LOOSE,

656
00:37:37,033 --> 00:37:39,051
LET SOPHIE AND PARKER GO.

657
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:40,746
OF COURSE.

658
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:43,620
YEAH.

659
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,387
KEEP THEM BOTH.

660
00:37:45,905 --> 00:37:46,685
OKAY.

661
00:37:49,525 --> 00:37:50,277
ALL RIGHT.

662
00:37:50,277 --> 00:37:51,941
I'M A MAN OF MY WORD.

663
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,939
LET'S DO THIS.

664
00:37:56,063 --> 00:37:57,279
YOU GO FIRST.

665
00:38:06,297 --> 00:38:08,630
YOU KNOW HE'S GOT GUYS AT
THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS, RIGHT?

666
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:09,973
OF COURSE.

667
00:38:09,973 --> 00:38:11,550
CAREFUL! CAREFUL!

668
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,999
I CAN REPLACE YOU.

669
00:38:14,395 --> 00:38:15,542
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. EASY.

670
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:16,790
PERFECT.

671
00:38:29,187 --> 00:38:30,431
FOUR GUYS?

672
00:38:37,926 --> 00:38:39,101
SIX GUYS?

673
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:41,964
SEE, HE'S GOOD,
BUT HE'S NOT THAT GOOD.

674
00:38:44,415 --> 00:38:45,859
SO, HOW ARE YOU GONNA
GET US OUT OF THIS?

675
00:38:45,859 --> 00:38:49,478
I HAD NO IDEA
HOW TO GET US OFF THIS ROOF.

676
00:38:50,292 --> 00:38:52,709
AND THEN I ASKED MYSELF...

677
00:38:54,092 --> 00:38:55,915
"WHAT WOULD PARKER DO?"

678
00:38:55,915 --> 00:38:58,649
WITH A COUPLE BROKEN RIBS
AND A CONCUSSION,

679
00:38:58,649 --> 00:39:02,159
I DON'T THINK ELIOT CAN TAKE OUT
SIX GUYS.

680
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:04,703
YOU KNOW, BUT THEN I THOUGHT,

681
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,710
"WHAT WOULD HARDISON DO?"

682
00:39:15,304 --> 00:39:16,579
WHAT'S GOING ON?

683
00:39:54,584 --> 00:39:57,123
GEARY, WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

684
00:39:57,123 --> 00:39:57,962
Sterling...

685
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,770
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
AN HONORABLE MAN.

686
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,445
I'M CATCHING THIEVES.

687
00:40:01,445 --> 00:40:03,077
THERE'S NOTHING
MORE HONORABLE.

688
00:40:05,645 --> 00:40:08,019
NATE, WE'RE DONE HERE.

689
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:09,059
HARDISON!

690
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:15,025
WAIT, ELIOT.

691
00:40:15,025 --> 00:40:16,186
ELIOT, COME ON.

692
00:40:17,237 --> 00:40:19,080
YOU'VE GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME, MAN.

693
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,343
BRING IT OUT.
COME ON.

694
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,820
THIS IS JUST WEIRD.
I PAINTED THIS.

695
00:40:37,138 --> 00:40:39,144
ALL RIGHT.
THIS ISN'T A TOTAL LOSS.

696
00:40:39,426 --> 00:40:40,845
FOUR OF THE BEST THIEVES
IN THE WORLD

697
00:40:40,845 --> 00:40:43,078
JUST LEFT ME A PAPER TRAIL
A MILE LONG.

698
00:40:43,078 --> 00:40:44,613
GET A TEAM UP HERE.

699
00:40:44,613 --> 00:40:45,996
PULL EVERY FILE.

700
00:40:45,996 --> 00:40:47,211
SHOULDN'T WE CALL
THE POLICE?

701
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:48,651
