1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:02,159
And tonight on "Hunt for the Truth".

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,174
A shocking development
in the school-bus scandal...

3
00:00:05,175 --> 00:00:07,883
that cost two children their lives.

4
00:00:07,977 --> 00:00:10,561
I have uncovered new information...

5
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:14,429
about the lowlife responsible
for this horrible accident--

6
00:00:14,608 --> 00:00:17,703
School-bus driver
Ray Pennington.

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,625
Mr. Pennington, how do you
respond to the allegations...

8
00:00:20,626 --> 00:00:23,579
that you were driving erratically
the morning of the accident?

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,811
I drove the way I normally do.
I- I didn't do anything improper.

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,817
That man, Ray Pennington...

11
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:33,453
was being treated
for severe mental illness...

12
00:00:33,537 --> 00:00:35,236
at the time of the accident.

13
00:00:35,237 --> 00:00:38,287
Friends, you have to ask yourself--
Do you know...

14
00:00:38,395 --> 00:00:40,818
who's driving your kids to school?

15
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,056
Joining us is psychiatrist
Dr. Bill Pratt.

16
00:00:44,197 --> 00:00:46,232
Dr. Pratt, isn't it true...

17
00:00:46,364 --> 00:00:49,260
that psychiatric medications
greatly impair...

18
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:51,688
- a person's driving ability?
- Dad...

19
00:00:51,956 --> 00:00:56,158
I thought we agreed you weren't going
to watch this whack job any more.

20
00:00:56,716 --> 00:00:57,740
Dad?

21
00:01:00,108 --> 00:01:00,990
Dad?

22
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:07,580
Daddy?!

23
00:01:09,242 --> 00:01:11,073
Daddy! Dad!

24
00:01:11,975 --> 00:01:13,729
Daddy! Dad!

25
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:16,025
Dad, can you hear me?
Dad!

26
00:01:16,128 --> 00:01:18,964
Dad, dad, dad!
Dad, can you hear me!

27
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:22,590
No! Dad, wake up!
Dad!

28
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:24,969
The doctor said
I got to him just in time.

29
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,373
No charges were brought
against your father?

30
00:01:27,374 --> 00:01:30,624
No. It was ruled mechanical failure.
The police completely cleared him.

31
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,394
All right, but of course that wouldn't make
for a very good story, would it?

32
00:01:33,395 --> 00:01:36,839
Well, the accident was a tragedy,
and everyone was devastated.

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,654
But nobody pointed a finger at dad...

34
00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:40,953
until Monica Hunter decided
to make him her latest villain.

35
00:01:40,954 --> 00:01:43,487
Look, I'm sorry to bring this up,
but we need to know.

36
00:01:43,488 --> 00:01:45,704
What about the mental illness?

37
00:01:46,705 --> 00:01:48,592
When my dad got out
of the first Gulf War...

38
00:01:48,593 --> 00:01:51,665
he was given antidepressants
for post-traumatic stress.

39
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,863
He hasn't taken them in 14 years.

40
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,320
- She made up lie after lie.
- Wow.

41
00:01:56,627 --> 00:01:58,665
Here's what we can do--
we can probably get you...

42
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,999
enough money to save the house
and pay for medical bills.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,325
We aren't interested
in money, Mr. Ford.

44
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:06,044
This woman took
my father's self-esteem.

45
00:02:06,157 --> 00:02:08,931
She took his reputation.
She took his good name.

46
00:02:08,932 --> 00:02:10,950
That's what he needs back.

47
00:02:12,285 --> 00:02:15,178
All right, yeah.
We'll see what we can do.

48
00:02:16,728 --> 00:02:18,828
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

49
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:19,836
Sure.

50
00:02:22,147 --> 00:02:25,497
I want to take the lead on this one.
I want to do what you do.

51
00:02:25,498 --> 00:02:28,389
Yeah, listen, I know break-ups
can be very difficult, Sophie.

52
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,221
Whoa. No, that's not
what this is about.

53
00:02:30,222 --> 00:02:33,107
And I know that you have this need
to be in control right now, you know.

54
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:36,179
- I don't have any such need.
- But you can't project that onto the con.

55
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,042
Excuse me? this coming from the man
who spent an entire year drunk...

56
00:02:40,043 --> 00:02:43,046
working out his obsessive vengeance
on every single dimwit in a suit...

57
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:44,996
who happened to cross
our line of vision?

58
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:47,288
You put some thought
into that one, didn't you?

59
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:52,831
You know, I'm not trying to control the universe
just because some guy dumped me.

60
00:02:52,832 --> 00:02:54,316
I-- I--

61
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:57,181
I appreciate the concern.
I just--

62
00:02:58,155 --> 00:03:00,511
I need a new challenge.

63
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:02,694
Okay.

64
00:03:04,772 --> 00:03:06,495
This is your job.

65
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,383
Thanks.

66
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,918
Yeah.
Let's go get this bitch.

67
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:21,672
Oh, boy.

68
00:03:24,385 --> 00:03:27,255

they take what they want.

69
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,180

75

Now, we've stolen a lot of odd things before,
but how do we steal back a man's reputation?

76
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,481
We get the network to issue a complete apology
and utterly disavow Monica Hunter's story.

77
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:01,740
- What?
- Yeah, Sophie's gonna be doing this one.

78
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:03,639
- What?
- Yeah.

79
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,801
Yeah. I'm gonna be Nate on this one,
only, you know, nicer.

80
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:10,825
But if you're gonna be Nate,
then who's gonna be you?

81
00:04:10,826 --> 00:04:12,255
- You?
- Me?

82
00:04:12,256 --> 00:04:15,253
I- I don't mean to obsess about
the last time Sophie ran a con...

83
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:18,058
but, I'm sorry, where we had
to blow up the offices.

84
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:20,262
Really?
Because I- I don't remember that.

85
00:04:20,263 --> 00:04:22,613
- I do.
- Oh, Hardison, just run it.

86
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:27,619
If you don't mind, I thought I would
still do the "Hardison, run it" thing.

87
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:29,582
Hardison, run it.

88
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:35,233
Well, Monica Hunter's "Hunt for the Truth"
has been the top show in her time slot...

89
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:38,701
for the last eight years.
She calls it an exposé-show.

90
00:04:38,702 --> 00:04:42,163
Each episode includes three elements--
incriminating documents...

91
00:04:42,164 --> 00:04:46,283
embarrassing footage of the subject,
and an expert to make it legit.

92
00:04:46,284 --> 00:04:50,677
Now, she mixes this all into one
hatchet job, on some poor citizen...

93
00:04:50,678 --> 00:04:53,876
turning them into the Boogeyman--
doesn't matter whether or not they're guilty.

94
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,848
If the victim tries to sue the network
just buries them in lawyers.

95
00:04:56,849 --> 00:05:00,249
Yeah, she demonizes perfectly
innocent people for ratings...

96
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,580
and then stands behind the network,
thinking they're gonna protect her.

97
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:06,088
- We're gonna sever that relationship.
- How?

98
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:09,800
We're gonna get her to go on air with
a fake story that just destroys her reputation.

99
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:13,429
It's like when you find a crooked cop, you know,
all- all his cases go right out the window.

100
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,165
Exactly. And then,
to protect themselves...

101
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:20,017
they issue an apology to Mr. Pennington,
and then they throw Monica Hunter...

102
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:25,532
into the jaws of the very media machine
that she bent to her own malicious will.

103
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:27,241
Oh, wow.

104
00:05:27,406 --> 00:05:30,795
I got to say, Sophie's briefings
are much more dramatic.

105
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,335
And poetic.

106
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,403
You see, what we need to do, though--
What we need is-- We got to sell her...

107
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:39,188
a fake news story
that she- she can't refuse.

108
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:43,024
That's what we got to do, because what
does she have? She has fame. She has money.

109
00:05:43,025 --> 00:05:45,459
What does she need?
She--

110
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:47,504
Sorry.

111
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,513
What does she have?
She has fame. She has money.

112
00:05:53,514 --> 00:05:55,415
What does she need?

113
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:57,902
Respect.

114
00:05:58,494 --> 00:06:01,198
Yeah, she's a joke
among serious journalists.

115
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,108
Look, here's e-mails from her agent
and internal memos from the network.

116
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:08,459
See, every time her contract's up,
she tries to go and get a job...

117
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,920
on a serious news show, but she gets
laughed out of the room every time.

118
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:13,895
Yeah, well, we can't sell her respect.

119
00:06:13,896 --> 00:06:16,458
But we can sell her a story
that commands respect--

120
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,126
A story that she's gonna chase
to get the respect she craves.

121
00:06:20,276 --> 00:06:25,666
Hmm? Pack your bags, everyone.
We're going to D.C. to make news.

122
00:06:29,037 --> 00:06:30,837
That's when you want to...

123
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,025
I'm gonna do that bit again.
Pack your bags, everyone.

124
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:38,276
We're going to D.C. to make news.

125
00:06:41,717 --> 00:06:44,139
She's walking into the closet.

126
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:54,693
Friends, join me tomorrow...

127
00:06:54,777 --> 00:06:57,472
as we hunt for the truth
in your own home.

128
00:06:57,566 --> 00:07:01,425
Which of your household
appliances is killing you?

129
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,369
It's not the one you think.

130
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:06,290
And we're... out.

131
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:07,931
Nice show, everyone.

132
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,443
What idiot made this coffee?

133
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,119
I got the pass--
Easy.

134
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,711
Parker, we went over this.
You're not supposed to take it.

135
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:22,668
- You're supposed to get caught with it.
- I don't know how to get caught.

136
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:26,935
Yeah, I know it's difficult to steal badly.
Just-- just try.

137
00:07:32,422 --> 00:07:34,637
I need this yesterday.
What am I paying you for?

138
00:07:34,638 --> 00:07:39,278
You can't make a cup of coffee.
Incompetence-- I'm surrounded by incompetence.

139
00:07:45,838 --> 00:07:49,818
- What the hell are you doing?
- Cindy Macallen. Casperkill nightly news.

140
00:07:49,931 --> 00:07:52,619
Casperkill?
How'd you get in here?

141
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:54,812
That's your cue.
Go on, leave now.

142
00:07:54,813 --> 00:07:56,710
Apparently I have to go.

143
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:06,289
Hey! Hey, I will have you
arrested for trespassing...

144
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,440
if you do not tell me
what you are doing here.

145
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:11,772
Well, technically, you can't have me arrested
for trespassing because you don't own the station.

146
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:13,783
Parker, just tell her the story.

147
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,281
I have a story--
A huge story.

148
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:18,063
- Pentagon.
- Right.

149
00:08:18,294 --> 00:08:21,017
There's a high-level source
at the pentagon that's been evading me.

150
00:08:21,018 --> 00:08:24,210
So you were gonna sneak
in using my press credentials?

151
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:25,124
Yes.

152
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:28,158
- Tell me the story.
- No, I can't.

153
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,693
Tell me or tell the police.

154
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:37,388
I have a story
that will bring down...

155
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:40,963
the President of the United States.

156
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:49,597
I have to warn you about my source.
He doesn't like strangers.

157
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:53,124
Strangers? I'm Monica Hunter.
I'm in 41 markets.

158
00:09:10,165 --> 00:09:12,365
Monica Hunter, meet Wade Perkins.

159
00:09:12,456 --> 00:09:16,205
I told you, don't bring nobody here.
They can't know that we know--

160
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,746
- Not now.
- I'm out.

161
00:09:17,747 --> 00:09:21,458
No, I know how this looks.
Just hear him out.

162
00:09:29,628 --> 00:09:31,898
Okay.
Three minutes.

163
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:35,176
Tell me a story
that'll bring down the president.

164
00:09:35,177 --> 00:09:38,404
T- the pre-- the president?
Man, the president said...

165
00:09:38,414 --> 00:09:41,132
he was gonna close down
Guantanamo Bay. He lied.

166
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:44,455
Guantanamo is being replaced
by a network of secret prisons...

167
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:47,526
right here in the United States, man.

168
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:51,478
These are satellite photos of vacant
military installations across the country--

169
00:09:51,479 --> 00:09:54,277
Empty missile silos, closed bases--

170
00:09:54,653 --> 00:09:57,357
Places we've abandoned
since the end of the cold war.

171
00:09:57,358 --> 00:10:00,661
Then, suddenly, three months ago,
the photos were taken offline and classified.

172
00:10:00,662 --> 00:10:03,923
Un-- un-- until I cracked
the encryption.

173
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:08,389
See, this h- here-- here's what
the government doesn't want you to see, man.

174
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,740
Come look, this--

175
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,928
Construction sites,
working around the clock...

176
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:15,812
installing generators
and water-filtration systems...

177
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:18,902
and-- and-- and-- and-- and--
and fully stocked kitchens, man.

178
00:10:18,903 --> 00:10:21,602
There's a word for that.
It's called government pork.

179
00:10:21,603 --> 00:10:26,451
No. No, a- all this construction
is going on underground, under--

180
00:10:26,452 --> 00:10:29,857
Beneath the eyes-- The eyes of the world, man.
They don't want you to see.

181
00:10:29,858 --> 00:10:31,988
Congress doesn't know.
Governors don't know.

182
00:10:31,989 --> 00:10:36,261
Red Cross, A.C.L.U., National Geographic--
Nobody knows, man, nobody, man.

183
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:40,293
They're putting terrorists in your backyard,
terrorists under your backyard.

184
00:10:40,294 --> 00:10:43,073
"Hey, little Billy, go outside.
Dig in the sandbox."

185
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:45,806
"Oh!" Clank! "What did you find,
little Billy? What did you find?"

186
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:49,206
"It's a terrorist!
It's a bunker full of terrorists, man!"

187
00:10:49,207 --> 00:10:50,491
Bunker, man.

188
00:10:50,688 --> 00:10:54,352
What other sources do you have
besides tinfoil hat over here?

189
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,572
I-- hey, hey, hey, man!

190
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:59,772
Being a tinfoil hat is better
than being a lap dog...

191
00:10:59,906 --> 00:11:03,556
for the four corporations
that control the global media, man.

192
00:11:03,617 --> 00:11:06,771
General Mark Chesler at the pentagon
is running this program.

193
00:11:06,772 --> 00:11:08,499
He's been ducking me.

194
00:11:08,695 --> 00:11:11,408
That's why I needed your credentials.

195
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:12,379
Okay.

196
00:11:12,952 --> 00:11:16,636
Call me tomorrow.
We'll hit the general in the morning.

197
00:11:18,632 --> 00:11:20,670
- That's what I'm talking about.
- All right.

198
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:22,557
And the cameraman--
The usual setup.

199
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:26,485
I must say, Monica, I'm proud of you,
helping out this young reporter.

200
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,943
Don't be silly, Steve.
Once I've got her sources...

201
00:11:28,944 --> 00:11:33,828
I'm kicking strawberry shortcake
to the curb. The story is all mine.

202
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,445
Hunter's hooked.

203
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:49,713
Our mark has a story and a source.
We're halfway home.

204
00:11:49,714 --> 00:11:51,314
Now for the hard part.

205
00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:53,753
We need to steal a general.

206
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:57,610
No, it's "Let's go steal a general",
you know? It's a rallying cry.

207
00:11:57,611 --> 00:11:58,422
Yeah.

208
00:11:58,423 --> 00:12:03,176
"We need to steal a general"-- it's all naggy.
It's kind of like, "We need eggs", you know?

209
00:12:03,177 --> 00:12:07,171
"We need eggs."
"We need eggs!", you know.

210
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:14,015
- No, I'm just trying to give you a little...
- You- you see what you did?

211
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:16,465
Eliot, these conspiracies
aren't real, right?

212
00:12:16,466 --> 00:12:19,963
- What do you mean?
- Like that one over there that says...

213
00:12:19,964 --> 00:12:24,641
all the major wars of the past 50 years
were ordered by members of "The Council"?

214
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:28,129
Parker, I'm not at liberty
to discuss that with you.

215
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,217
Well, you're not a member
of "The Council", are you?

216
00:12:32,705 --> 00:12:33,691
Eliot?

217
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,832
Is he?

218
00:12:37,142 --> 00:12:39,136
- Oh, I don't know.
- Huh?

219
00:12:40,394 --> 00:12:41,947
Uh, Nate?
Is he?

220
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:47,140
Meeting adjourned.

221
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:55,402
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

222
00:12:55,403 --> 00:12:59,915
General Chesler, I'm from Senator Ruden's office,
and he needs to speak with you immediately.

223
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:05,126
Uh, they are about to put a spike
in the XJ-12 armored-vehicle project.

224
00:13:05,276 --> 00:13:07,793
I'm just relaying the message.
I don't even know what that is, sir.

225
00:13:07,794 --> 00:13:11,013
It's the last eight years of my life.
That's what it is!

226
00:13:11,014 --> 00:13:12,154
Yes, sir, uh...

227
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:17,267
the senator would like you to meet him in his
office A.S.A.P. and bring the latest XJ-12 files.

228
00:13:17,268 --> 00:13:19,117
I don't have them on me!

229
00:13:19,118 --> 00:13:20,928
Don't have them on--
Yeah, right here.

230
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:24,196
"Call your secretary and have her meet
you there, pronto", and again, sir...

231
00:13:24,197 --> 00:13:28,218
I'm just relaying the senator's words--
they're not mine.

232
00:13:32,547 --> 00:13:35,912
Pamela, stop what
you're doing right now...

233
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:38,586
and grab the following files.

234
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44,215
- Sir.
- Sir.

235
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:47,051
Is she gonna buy this?

236
00:13:47,052 --> 00:13:49,338
Hardison changed
the general's profile online.

237
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:52,258
When she's on-camera,
Monica only looks at Monica.

238
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:55,605
- Parker, what's your 20?
- Seconds away.

239
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:04,315
Shouldn't we have called first
to schedule an interview?

240
00:14:04,316 --> 00:14:06,794
Schedule a-- ah, skipper...

241
00:14:07,038 --> 00:14:10,458
you're not covering the Tulip Festival
for the action news anymore.

242
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:13,030
- This is the real world.
- But what if he won't talk to us?

243
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:14,748
- Then we celebrate.
- Celebrate?

244
00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:17,690
Denial means guilt.
Refusal means more guilt.

245
00:14:17,812 --> 00:14:21,351
Punch out my cameraman,
and I'll kiss you on the mouth.

246
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,847
I knew it.

247
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:32,885
- We've got a shadow.
- What?

248
00:14:32,886 --> 00:14:37,739
It means you're being followed.
It means there's some meat on this bone.

249
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,112
All right, we're rolling.

250
00:14:45,957 --> 00:14:49,505
My friends, we are outside
the office of General Mark Chesler...

251
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:53,125
to discover the truth about
America's secret prisons.

252
00:14:55,915 --> 00:14:59,477
What's going on here? Who-- who
the hell let you in this building?

253
00:14:59,478 --> 00:15:03,178
General, who is being held
in the secret underground bunkers?

254
00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:05,342
I am late to a meeting.

255
00:15:05,343 --> 00:15:08,246
Then you don't deny
that these prisons exist?

256
00:15:08,368 --> 00:15:10,597
I don't know
what you're talking about.

257
00:15:10,598 --> 00:15:14,702
So, how long have you been
in charge of the prisons, General?

258
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:20,109
Here, take this.

259
00:15:21,123 --> 00:15:22,790
Watch the door.

260
00:15:49,184 --> 00:15:50,491
This is it--

261
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:55,532
Construction memos for the sites
in the satellite photos, all classified.

262
00:15:55,973 --> 00:15:59,110
"Cell requirements are
eight square feet per bed."

263
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:00,688
They are prisons.

264
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:04,311
- We've got our proof.
- Yes.

265
00:16:06,456 --> 00:16:07,836
Fair enough.

266
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:12,132
You bring that crackpot source of yours
down to my studio right now.

267
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:14,525
I'm gonna obscure his face,
disguise his voice...

268
00:16:14,526 --> 00:16:16,522
refer to him as my secret informant.

269
00:16:16,523 --> 00:16:19,287
Do you have any idea what this story
might mean for democracy?

270
00:16:19,288 --> 00:16:20,238
Whatever.

271
00:16:20,827 --> 00:16:25,772
I just wish I could see the faces
of those bastards at The Times and The Post

272
00:16:26,006 --> 00:16:29,772
When they find out they've got
to chase a Monica Hunter story.

273
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,522
My story, too, right?

274
00:16:36,352 --> 00:16:38,502
Hey, make sure to set the tivo.

275
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:40,971
I want to see how I look
with the fuzzy dot on my face.

276
00:16:40,972 --> 00:16:43,617
All right,
just don't push too hard.

277
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:48,804
- What? I'm...
- Bury her.

278
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:51,715
Three, two, one, Monica.

279
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:53,345
Friends...

280
00:16:53,617 --> 00:16:57,504
is your babysitter running
a call-girl ring while you're at work?

281
00:16:57,588 --> 00:17:02,887
Watch the shocking nanny-cam footage
tonight on "Hunt for the Truth".

282
00:17:03,215 --> 00:17:04,115
And cut.

283
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:06,126
- Nice show, everyone.
- Hardison! Hardison!

284
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:08,238
- Go in!
- Got it. got it.

285
00:17:11,553 --> 00:17:15,037
Hey, hey, hey, hey, chief.
What happened to the prison story, man?

286
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:17,647
Renfield. Betsy Wetsy.

287
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:20,360
I'll admit I was tempted.
I figured here's my chance...

288
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:23,142
to finally stick it
to the D.C. press corps.

289
00:17:23,227 --> 00:17:25,806
Then I got to work,
and I read these.

290
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:30,216
Nielsen Media--
these are your ratings.

291
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:34,140
On Monday, I had "Suburban teens
in secret pregnancy pact"--

292
00:17:34,141 --> 00:17:35,951
Number one in the time slot.

293
00:17:35,952 --> 00:17:38,152
Then Wednesday was
my social-security show--

294
00:17:38,153 --> 00:17:40,986
"Will your safety net be there
when you retire?"

295
00:17:40,987 --> 00:17:44,306
I lost to the discovery
and history channels--

296
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:45,956
Sharks and Nazis.

297
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,470
Now, granted, sharks and Nazis are cable
TV's heavy hitters, but that's no excuse.

298
00:17:50,471 --> 00:17:52,571
But this is a national scandal!

299
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:57,666
No, a scandal is whatever scares
Monica Hunter's viewers.

300
00:18:00,096 --> 00:18:03,649
Now, who are they gonna put in those
secret prisons? My viewers? No.

301
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,100
They're gonna put
bad people in there.

302
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:10,144
Secret government prisons
make Monica Hunter's viewers feel safer.

303
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:14,227
My job is to sell the morons
a steady diet of scary.

304
00:18:14,321 --> 00:18:16,727
They want a reason
to lock their doors.

305
00:18:16,822 --> 00:18:17,995
Fear sells...

306
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:22,131
- and Monica Hunter is in the fear business.
- That's not cool, man.

307
00:18:22,132 --> 00:18:24,471
Don't you understand?
If you don't get this, someone else will.

308
00:18:24,472 --> 00:18:26,630
You're missing out on the biggest
opportunity of your life!

309
00:18:26,631 --> 00:18:28,493
Listen to us!
Everything's at stake!

310
00:18:28,494 --> 00:18:29,892
Thank you.

311
00:18:30,517 --> 00:18:32,567
What are we gonna do now?

312
00:18:39,088 --> 00:18:42,224
All right.
She wants fear?

313
00:18:43,641 --> 00:18:45,876
That's what we'll give her.

314
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,431
This is how it starts.

315
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:56,771
Go for Hunter.

316
00:18:56,772 --> 00:19:00,069
Monica, it's Cindy Macallen.
There's more to this thing than we thought.

317
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,143
- The general called me.
- Large latte?

318
00:19:02,144 --> 00:19:05,447
Look, Cindy, I told you, there's no
"Hunt for the Truth" story here.

319
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:07,599
Please, I'm right outside!

320
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,580
Give me just two minutes.

321
00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:13,621
It's big, Monica.
It's bigger than we thought.

322
00:19:17,293 --> 00:19:19,406
Somebody call 911!

323
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:37,014
Don't stop.
Come on.

324
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:40,485
- They ran her over!
- I know, I know. But we got to go.

325
00:19:40,486 --> 00:19:43,997
The security cameras, the ATM cameras,
the traffic cameras-- we're always being watched.

326
00:19:43,998 --> 00:19:47,317
- Just put your head down and act natural.
- Wait, why are you dressed like a mailman?

327
00:19:47,318 --> 00:19:49,973
I'm invisible, man. Mailman--
nobody notices the mailman.

328
00:19:49,974 --> 00:19:52,482
He blends right in just like
a- a circus clown. Wait, wait--

329
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,928
- Did- did she tell you?
- The general called.

330
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:57,729
Yes. He called last night.
He wants to meet--

331
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,473
Had a bad case of the sweats
and a guilty conscience.

332
00:20:00,474 --> 00:20:02,142
What's this all about?

333
00:20:02,231 --> 00:20:06,489
Something worth killing her over.
Is it a big enough story for you now?

334
00:20:29,372 --> 00:20:31,109
Where the hell are we?

335
00:20:31,288 --> 00:20:35,188
No- no windows, no cameras, no crowds--
It's the perfect place to meet.

336
00:20:35,189 --> 00:20:38,521
Now, look-- look-- look,
do you want the truth or not, man?

337
00:20:38,522 --> 00:20:40,864
Miss Hunter!
Where's Macallen?

338
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:45,015
Macallen had an accident...
right in front of me.

339
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,912
They're cleaning up the loose ends.

340
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:50,607
Not the ends, man,
not the ends, man. I like...

341
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:52,568
Trimethylxanthine--

342
00:20:52,653 --> 00:20:54,488
I'll try and see
if I can get you some.

343
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:56,545
- Trimethyl what?
- It's an antidote...

344
00:20:56,546 --> 00:21:00,505
the C.I.A. came up with in '73
during the Tokyo intervention.

345
00:21:00,862 --> 00:21:04,062
- Antidote to what?
- Well, there's been an incident.

346
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,567
An incident?

347
00:21:06,661 --> 00:21:10,967
Don't spin me, General.
I'm Monica frickin' Hunter...

348
00:21:11,126 --> 00:21:13,464
and I am on a hunt for the truth.

349
00:21:13,586 --> 00:21:15,895
Three weeks ago,
there was a breach...

350
00:21:15,987 --> 00:21:20,280
at one of our weapons-research labs
outside of D.C.

351
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:22,620
Something got inside the water.

352
00:21:22,621 --> 00:21:25,277
It's in the water? I always knew
it was in the water.

353
00:21:25,278 --> 00:21:26,688
Will you shut up?!

354
00:21:26,689 --> 00:21:29,683
A virally replicating
chemical nerve agent--

355
00:21:29,983 --> 00:21:31,249
A nerve gas.

356
00:21:31,465 --> 00:21:34,734
Dissolves in the water,
spreads like a disease.

357
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:36,547
No.

358
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:40,760
No, we would've heard from the hospitals,
people coming in with symptoms.

359
00:21:40,761 --> 00:21:45,258
It takes a while for it to rise
to toxic level in the human system.

360
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:48,506
People should start getting sick
any day now.

361
00:21:48,966 --> 00:21:50,287
I don't understand.

362
00:21:50,288 --> 00:21:53,420
What does this have to do
with the secret prisons?

363
00:21:53,505 --> 00:21:55,355
She thinks they're prisons!

364
00:21:56,092 --> 00:21:57,692
Out here's the prison.

365
00:21:58,149 --> 00:22:03,685
They're shelters for the elite--
Environmentally sound safe houses...

366
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:07,723
with their own
refiltering water supply--

367
00:22:07,979 --> 00:22:11,012
Good for two years
of underground living...

368
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:14,686
even though I think we'll
only need about six months.

369
00:22:14,687 --> 00:22:18,750
If you think the American people
are gonna stand by and watch...

370
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:21,305
while thousands of D.C.
residents get sick and--

371
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:23,605
T- thousands?
Thousands?

372
00:22:23,606 --> 00:22:27,195
You-- you don't get it, man!
It's-- it's in the water!

373
00:22:27,196 --> 00:22:29,646
Once it's in the condensation cycle...

374
00:22:29,647 --> 00:22:32,660
it starts getting in rain clouds
and rain drops.

375
00:22:32,744 --> 00:22:34,475
Rain--
It keeps falling, man!

376
00:22:34,476 --> 00:22:37,144
It's not raining men, man,
it's it's raining death!

377
00:22:37,145 --> 00:22:39,028
It's raining death, man!

378
00:22:40,195 --> 00:22:42,697
In a couple of days,
being in one of those bunkers...

379
00:22:42,698 --> 00:22:46,118
will be the only safe place
in the entire country.

380
00:22:50,686 --> 00:22:52,386
I still need more proof.

381
00:22:52,387 --> 00:22:55,923
It's all in the file
that Macallen took-- the red file.

382
00:23:02,158 --> 00:23:05,388
They stole that file off of her body.

383
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:08,218
You have other sources.
Use them.

384
00:23:08,528 --> 00:23:10,855
Project is code-named Destiny.

385
00:23:11,334 --> 00:23:15,026
It's up to you, Hunter. It's up to you
to warn the American people.

386
00:23:15,027 --> 00:23:17,279
Now go hunt for the truth!

387
00:23:21,673 --> 00:23:24,705
- We totally went to the moon.
- Movie sets.

388
00:23:24,706 --> 00:23:27,758
I've seen them.
They're outside of Albuquerque.

389
00:23:28,002 --> 00:23:30,696
- Why would there still be sets there?
- Because they're...

390
00:23:30,697 --> 00:23:34,533
gonna reuse them for the mars mission--
Repaint it all red.

391
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:36,835
Oh, peppermint!

392
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:40,057
Are you sure it's cool
to let her loose?

393
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,548
She has to have corroboration
from her own sources.

394
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:46,576
She has to craft the narrative.

395
00:23:46,577 --> 00:23:52,454
Monica Hunter has to be the author
of her own personal nightmare.

396
00:23:52,707 --> 00:23:56,541
- Do I sound that creepy when I--
- Hell yes.

397
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,083
- Really?
- You do.

398
00:23:58,084 --> 00:24:02,304
The only question is whether
Hardison guessed her sources right.

399
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:05,137
- G- guess? Guess?
- Well, you know...

400
00:24:05,138 --> 00:24:08,632
Woman, my name's Alec Hardison.
I do not guess, okay?

401
00:24:08,764 --> 00:24:12,375
Look, journalists-- they're lazy.
They always go back to the same sources.

402
00:24:12,376 --> 00:24:14,882
I compared Monica Hunter stories
for the last 10 years...

403
00:24:14,883 --> 00:24:18,337
and created a heuristic model
based on her sources.

404
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,776
I filtered by story type,
priority, and evidentiary chain.

405
00:24:22,954 --> 00:24:23,827
Look.

406
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:27,704
Sex scandal-- 87% chance
she goes to these sources.

407
00:24:27,957 --> 00:24:29,550
Serial-killer scare--

408
00:24:29,644 --> 00:24:32,811
90%, she contacts these sources
for confirmation.

409
00:24:33,017 --> 00:24:36,139
Government secrets
and health scare intersects--

410
00:24:36,261 --> 00:24:39,036
95% chance she goes
to these sources.

411
00:24:39,682 --> 00:24:41,231
Look, look. You--

412
00:24:41,428 --> 00:24:44,911
Right there, she's e-mailing
them right now. Look.

413
00:24:45,883 --> 00:24:50,203
I... am answering...
for them.

414
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:57,808
I can neither confirm nor deny
the existence of project Destiny.

415
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:08,304
See, now all of her cellphone calls
to these sources go straight to voice mail.

416
00:25:08,305 --> 00:25:14,054
Leaving her no choice but to contact
the one and only source that we let her speak to.

417
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:17,308
- Yeah, I can do that. Sure.
- It's a lock.

418
00:25:17,537 --> 00:25:18,816
Congressman!

419
00:25:19,244 --> 00:25:21,338
Ah, Monica,
my favorite journalist.

420
00:25:21,339 --> 00:25:24,187
- What can I do for you?
- I need you to tell me the truth...

421
00:25:24,188 --> 00:25:25,411
Of course.

422
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:26,993
...about Destiny.

423
00:25:29,818 --> 00:25:34,950
Now, here on the main stage,
let's give it up for Destiny.

424
00:25:35,606 --> 00:25:39,308
- I bought you a car, baby!
- Thank you, baby.

425
00:25:39,532 --> 00:25:40,518
Ooh!

426
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,270
Give me that!
Who told you about Destiny?

427
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:48,654
You can't tell anyone! That would be
the end-- the end of everything!

428
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:51,313
It's true.

429
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:14,358
Oh...

430
00:26:29,644 --> 00:26:32,677
Monica, we're shooting promos.
Get made up.

431
00:26:34,808 --> 00:26:37,467
- Monica.
- No, it's everywhere.

432
00:26:37,589 --> 00:26:39,523
It really is everywhere.

433
00:26:40,613 --> 00:26:43,601
This is the studio security footage
from three hours ago.

434
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,741
Now, that's what I call control.

435
00:26:46,873 --> 00:26:49,304
Yeah, we might've pushed too hard.

436
00:26:49,389 --> 00:26:50,643
Please.

437
00:26:51,545 --> 00:26:53,601
It's me-- Monica Hunter.

438
00:26:54,808 --> 00:26:56,207
Are you there?

439
00:26:57,888 --> 00:26:59,156
Let me in!

440
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,899
Oh, thank god. You're the only one
I can trust to help me get this footage.

441
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,345
Fo-- some footage, man?

442
00:27:06,346 --> 00:27:08,489
I need you to take me
to one of the bunkers, now.

443
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,920
We need video proof.
We are gonna blow this wide open.

444
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:13,804
- All right, I'm doing--
- Come on, let's go!

445
00:27:16,326 --> 00:27:18,867
- Too much.
- Little bit.

446
00:27:33,329 --> 00:27:34,192
Here?

447
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:37,469
Hold-- hold-- hold--
Hold on, hold-- hold on.

448
00:27:37,976 --> 00:27:40,542
H- hold on.
Hold on a second.

449
00:27:46,776 --> 00:27:49,565
Okay, all right,
your satellite photos...

450
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:54,445
have something that will pass
as a bunker at the army reserve base.

451
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:57,267
I'm right behind you.

452
00:27:59,748 --> 00:28:03,053
But there's nothing in there but tank parts.
Just get the footage and run.

453
00:28:03,054 --> 00:28:07,434
And Nate's right behind you.
He's gonna pick you up and do the blow-off.

454
00:28:07,713 --> 00:28:08,689
Okay.

455
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,582
Well, there you go.

456
00:28:30,017 --> 00:28:31,998
We're not close enough.

457
00:28:32,483 --> 00:28:33,938
Shoot me.

458
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:39,485
This is Monica Hunter,
coming to you...

459
00:28:39,486 --> 00:28:44,129
from a secret military base
just outside of Washington, D.C....

460
00:28:44,338 --> 00:28:48,322
with the most shocking
"Hunt for the Truth" ever.

461
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:56,883
You--

462
00:28:59,202 --> 00:29:01,927
- Sergeant!
- Sir, yes, sir!

463
00:29:08,491 --> 00:29:10,823
Hey!
Get off of the fence!

464
00:29:11,002 --> 00:29:14,102
- Hey, Hardison, Hardison. What's--
- On your feet!

465
00:29:16,616 --> 00:29:18,456
This is U.S. Army!
Don't move!

466
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:21,329
Drop the camera!
Hands in the air now!

467
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:26,434
Glass half full--

468
00:29:27,373 --> 00:29:30,100
She really buys the bunker story.

469
00:29:33,873 --> 00:29:36,613
Listen, you don't have
to pretend with me.

470
00:29:36,717 --> 00:29:40,123
I know.
I know about the bunkers.

471
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:42,741
Ma'am, there are no bunkers.

472
00:29:42,928 --> 00:29:46,594
- I know you have to say that.
- Uh-huh.

473
00:29:46,979 --> 00:29:49,396
A -all this--
this is an army base?

474
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:51,601
What did you think it was?

475
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,591
I-- I don't know.
I don't know that white woman.

476
00:29:55,592 --> 00:29:58,191
I met her at a bar. She said
we was going back to her place.

477
00:29:58,192 --> 00:30:00,098
I thought it was a gated community.

478
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:01,929
And the video camera?

479
00:30:02,591 --> 00:30:04,501
S- she a freak, man.

480
00:30:10,137 --> 00:30:11,433
Hold on.

481
00:30:16,277 --> 00:30:17,592
Get me out of here.

482
00:30:17,593 --> 00:30:19,695
- Yeah, I- I'm working on it.
- I'm on it.

483
00:30:19,696 --> 00:30:22,054
No, no, no, no, no!
You cannot go. You're dead.

484
00:30:22,055 --> 00:30:24,502
Monica Hunter sees you,
and the whole con is blown.

485
00:30:24,503 --> 00:30:25,558
Right.

486
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:30,310
Damn the con. I'm a black man caught
on an army base with a video camera.

487
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:32,779
I am going to jail for ever.

488
00:30:32,883 --> 00:30:35,491
Yeah, look, Nate's the only one
close enough to get you.

489
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:38,192
Yeah, but Nate's five minutes away
and still trying to figure out...

490
00:30:38,193 --> 00:30:40,497
how he's going to walk
two prisoners off an army base...

491
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:42,886
using an I.D. that's already
been reported stolen.

492
00:30:42,887 --> 00:30:44,933
No, guys,
we're gonna have to stall.

493
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:46,761
S- stall?

494
00:30:48,495 --> 00:30:52,042
Eliot, get me everything you can
on a Lieutenant Abbot.

495
00:30:52,043 --> 00:30:54,842
Just-- just do-- do--
do what I taught you.

496
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:58,655
The "http" thing comes
before the "www."...

497
00:30:58,656 --> 00:30:59,942
- Right?
- Eliot!

498
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:02,419
- And which one's the forward slash?
- Oh, come on.

499
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,697
It ain't the time, Eliot.
It ain't-- it ain't the time.

500
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:07,555
You see, it's not that much fun
when you're hanging out there in the wind...

501
00:31:07,556 --> 00:31:10,288
and there's a dude behind
a laptop cracking jokes, is there?

502
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:13,448
I like it when we switch jobs.
It's exciting.

503
00:31:15,257 --> 00:31:16,177
Okay.

504
00:31:16,544 --> 00:31:19,044
Let's pretend
there aren't any bunkers.

505
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:22,449
- There aren't any bunkers.
- You're a horrible liar.

506
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:27,931
In these bunkers that don't exist,
there's going to be panic.

507
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:31,401
- Who's panicking?
- The special people.

508
00:31:32,746 --> 00:31:37,842
And you know what you could use?
A familiar face from the media...

509
00:31:38,829 --> 00:31:40,970
a face that they trust.

510
00:31:44,426 --> 00:31:46,764
That's everything on this guy.

511
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:53,156
Sir, I need to know
why you're on this base.

512
00:31:54,932 --> 00:31:58,069
Yes.
Why am I on this base?

513
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,472
- I'm asking you.
- No, I'm asking you.

514
00:32:00,566 --> 00:32:02,409
Why am I on this base?

515
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:05,226
- Why am I in this room?
- So I can ask you questions.

516
00:32:05,227 --> 00:32:08,926
Well, maybe it's so I can ask you questions,
Lieutenant Kyle Abbot...

517
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:13,001
social security 823-24-6270.

518
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:15,592
- I don't know what you're up to--
- Maybe you're not cleared to know.

519
00:32:15,593 --> 00:32:17,704
Two disciplinary actions?

520
00:32:17,884 --> 00:32:20,734
That one in Germany--
tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

521
00:32:20,823 --> 00:32:23,673
Maybe you're just too much
of a security risk.

522
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,297
Did I say you could leave?

523
00:32:33,642 --> 00:32:36,369
- Not gonna work.
- It's all in the salute, man.

524
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:40,143
Just work the stars and bars.
Nobody wants to look a general in the eye.

525
00:32:40,144 --> 00:32:42,494
Uh, good form, soldier.
As you were.

526
00:32:43,073 --> 00:32:43,965
Clear.

527
00:32:59,747 --> 00:33:00,761
Sir.

528
00:33:09,693 --> 00:33:13,007
Sir, mine is freaking me
right out, sir.

529
00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:14,938
Mine appears to be insane.

530
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:18,144
No, not insane--
just a reporter.

531
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,690
Well, congratulations, gentlemen.

532
00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:24,562
This base has passed with, uh,
flying colors. Well done.

533
00:33:25,514 --> 00:33:27,129
Passed what, sir?

534
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:30,673
Have you not been briefed?
You were supposed to be briefed.

535
00:33:30,674 --> 00:33:32,552
The Department of Defense...

536
00:33:32,937 --> 00:33:35,875
has decided to reassure
the American people...

537
00:33:35,876 --> 00:33:38,070
about the safety
of their military bases...

538
00:33:38,071 --> 00:33:42,451
so we've agreed to cooperate with
the network and make a television special--

539
00:33:42,452 --> 00:33:46,267
You know, to show off just how
effective our security is.

540
00:33:46,352 --> 00:33:48,702
They were pretty easy to catch, sir.

541
00:33:48,787 --> 00:33:52,335
Well, for you.
But at Camp Munroe in Idaho...

542
00:33:52,336 --> 00:33:56,532
those two were signing their name
on nukes with shiny silver pens.

543
00:33:56,991 --> 00:33:59,423
Turn them loose now,
and I'll get them out of your hair.

544
00:33:59,424 --> 00:34:00,804
Of course, sir.

545
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:04,816
You're free to go, ma'am.

546
00:34:07,168 --> 00:34:09,497
All right, let's go.

547
00:34:10,343 --> 00:34:14,322
Sorry to waste your time, gentlemen.
All right, well done, men.

548
00:34:14,951 --> 00:34:18,547
Lieutenant, you catch
a full name on that I.D.?

549
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:22,580
- General Chesler, sir?
- That is not General Chesler.

550
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:26,800
All right, find out who they are!
Don't let anyone off the base!

551
00:34:27,784 --> 00:34:31,210
- Oh, trimethylxanthine. Thank you.
- It just slows down the effect of the toxin...

552
00:34:31,211 --> 00:34:33,548
hopefully long enough for you
to get the truth out.

553
00:34:33,549 --> 00:34:35,511
- How did you find us?
- Are you kidding me?

554
00:34:35,512 --> 00:34:39,145
A famous reporter shows up at one of the
bunkers, sets off alarms all over the city.

555
00:34:39,146 --> 00:34:42,055
Yeah, we're gonna be lucky if we get out
of here in one piece, I'll tell you that.

556
00:34:42,056 --> 00:34:43,257
- We'll split up.
- No.

557
00:34:43,258 --> 00:34:46,121
Yes, your car is still parked out over
by the fence. Wade, you pick it up...

558
00:34:46,122 --> 00:34:47,824
and we'll meet you
back at the apartment.

559
00:34:47,825 --> 00:34:50,658
We'll gather the evidence,
and we'll meet at the studio.

560
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:53,394
Hey!
Stop right there.

561
00:34:53,582 --> 00:34:55,443
- You were right.
- Let's go!

562
00:34:55,444 --> 00:34:58,183
No! Hold it!

563
00:34:58,184 --> 00:35:00,923
- Stop! No! Sergeant!
- Yes, sir!

564
00:35:00,924 --> 00:35:03,064
Stop that car!
Stop it!

565
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,357
Stop that vehicle!

566
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,873
Sir, the only I.D. that
checked out was the woman--

567
00:35:18,874 --> 00:35:20,367
Monica Hunter.

568
00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:24,382
"Hunt for the Truth"?
I thought she looked familiar.

569
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:26,578
Call the police.

570
00:35:28,721 --> 00:35:31,847
I've got the footage of the shelters
and the testimony of a three-star general.

571
00:35:31,848 --> 00:35:34,860
They can't continue the program
with this kind of exposure.

572
00:35:34,861 --> 00:35:37,526
We're gonna grab the satellite photos,
go down, and put you on the air.

573
00:35:37,527 --> 00:35:40,205
I am going to make them pay
for keeping me out of those bunkers...

574
00:35:40,206 --> 00:35:41,050
Yeah.

575
00:35:41,051 --> 00:35:42,562
- ...and lying...
- Yeah.

576
00:35:42,563 --> 00:35:44,921
- ...and injustice.
- Yeah.

577
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,722
Where did it go?

578
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,618
The photos!
The maps!

579
00:35:56,933 --> 00:35:58,952
Where's Wade Perkins?

580
00:36:00,281 --> 00:36:02,300
Thank god, the red file!

581
00:36:05,314 --> 00:36:06,469
Pardon me.

582
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:11,104
- I was just cleaning up.
- We hunt for the truth...

583
00:36:11,618 --> 00:36:14,059
through many dark places.

584
00:36:14,763 --> 00:36:17,057
I am a patriot, Miss Hunter.

585
00:36:17,517 --> 00:36:19,607
I'm sorry. Earl?

586
00:36:29,573 --> 00:36:31,967
Good things Parker switched
that with water, huh?

587
00:36:31,968 --> 00:36:34,164
Didn't-- didn't switch.
Oh!

588
00:36:35,562 --> 00:36:37,506
Earnings reports
continue to come in...

589
00:36:37,507 --> 00:36:40,284
and as expected, several major
players are facing some...

590
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:42,590
I've got to get on the air, now.

591
00:36:42,862 --> 00:36:45,181
- Are you drunk?
- Steve...

592
00:36:45,434 --> 00:36:47,303
listen very carefully.

593
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:51,033
You've got to patch me in
to the emergency-broadcast system.

594
00:36:51,034 --> 00:36:54,392
I've got to go
on the air live now...

595
00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:57,352
- before they come for me.
- They what?

596
00:36:57,568 --> 00:37:00,849
Monica, we're in the middle
of the stock report.

597
00:37:01,546 --> 00:37:04,231
Fine.
I'll do it myself.

598
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:08,333
...that those figures do compare favorably
with first-quarter productivity...

599
00:37:08,334 --> 00:37:10,938
though confounding expectations
of labor costs...

600
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:12,140
Get out!

601
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,124
We have breaking news.

602
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,955
And now, Monica Hunter
with some breaking news.

603
00:37:22,068 --> 00:37:26,650
- Monica, what are you doing?
- Saving your life, Steve.

604
00:37:28,154 --> 00:37:31,891
This is a very special edition
of "Hunt for the Truth".

605
00:37:32,097 --> 00:37:35,308
My friends, I have brought
you stories before...

606
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:39,098
of injustices, of dangers lurking
all around us...

607
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:43,749
but tonight, my friends,
the enemy is everywhere.

608
00:37:49,762 --> 00:37:54,457
My friends, this is the enemy.
Our water has been poisoned.

609
00:37:55,669 --> 00:37:58,847
Do not drink it.
Don't even look at it.

610
00:37:58,848 --> 00:38:01,219
- Don't let it touch your skin.
- Has she lost her mind?

611
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,414
- Where is she getting this?!
- My friends...

612
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:05,443
while we are out here dying...

613
00:38:05,444 --> 00:38:08,316
our government has secured
the so-called elites...

614
00:38:08,317 --> 00:38:10,706
in secret underground bunkers...

615
00:38:10,818 --> 00:38:14,285
to protect them
from this poison outbreak.

616
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:19,689
Even now, these privileged few
are hiding underground...

617
00:38:19,999 --> 00:38:24,364
- while we are out here...
- What the hell is that footage?!

618
00:38:24,776 --> 00:38:26,899
Why can't you turn it off?

619
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,041
Do not adjust your sets.

620
00:38:30,238 --> 00:38:33,611
I control the horizontal.
I control the vertical.

621
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:35,517
The water is poisoned.

622
00:38:35,518 --> 00:38:39,581
What's that typing?! Who's typing this?!
Hey, you! Find out who's doing this!

623
00:38:39,582 --> 00:38:43,246
And I have the proof.
I have the proof right here.

624
00:38:45,411 --> 00:38:46,529
What?

625
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:48,303
No.

626
00:38:49,437 --> 00:38:50,517
What?

627
00:38:51,306 --> 00:38:54,830
No! No! No! No!

628
00:38:55,074 --> 00:38:57,468
See, they want to kill me
because I know the truth.

629
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:58,239
No!

630
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,057
No! No!

631
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,431
No!!

632
00:39:07,187 --> 00:39:09,712
These are--
are you on antipsychotics?

633
00:39:09,713 --> 00:39:13,143
No, they're antivirals
for the water.

634
00:39:13,528 --> 00:39:15,143
Give them to me!

635
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,013
Let go! Let go!

636
00:39:19,304 --> 00:39:20,431
Go, go!

637
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:22,987
No!

638
00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:27,529
This is breaking news right here
in our own studios at BNI.

639
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:31,557
- Monica Hunter is being taken into custody...
- I'm Monica frickin' Hunter!

640
00:39:31,558 --> 00:39:37,274
...after suffering what appears to be
a psychotic break live on air.

641
00:39:37,872 --> 00:39:40,445
Well, seeing this public meltdown...

642
00:39:40,446 --> 00:39:43,874
what are your thoughts about
Monica Hunter's fall from grace?

643
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:47,395
I'm just glad that people
finally know the truth...

644
00:39:47,911 --> 00:39:51,131
and I'm really glad to have
my good name back.

645
00:39:51,508 --> 00:39:54,935
Thank you, Ray. For now,
we can only pose the question...

646
00:39:54,936 --> 00:39:58,823
how many other good people
did Monica Hunter destroy?

647
00:39:59,178 --> 00:40:01,502
See, Ray was just the beginning.
I'm telling you...

648
00:40:01,503 --> 00:40:04,399
every person that Hunter slandered
is gonna get a second chance.

649
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,842
Loch Ness Monster?

650
00:40:05,934 --> 00:40:08,004
- Loch Ness submarine.
- No!

651
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:11,586
Scottish waters are cold and deep.
It's the perfect place to test.

652
00:40:11,587 --> 00:40:12,607
Area 51?

653
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,363
- True.
- False.

654
00:40:14,702 --> 00:40:17,863
- That's true.
- False. No, she said Area 51-- 51.

655
00:40:17,864 --> 00:40:20,670
I'm sorry, false--
Area 52.

656
00:40:20,971 --> 00:40:23,000
- Been there.
- Yeah.

657
00:40:25,744 --> 00:40:26,917
Hey.

658
00:40:30,914 --> 00:40:33,975
Come on. You had
a little bit of fun, right?

659
00:40:35,272 --> 00:40:38,001
I mean, it's always fun.
I just--

660
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:41,992
No, it didn't really
hit the spot. I--

661
00:40:42,396 --> 00:40:47,217
I thought it would be really cool,
you know, switching roles, but... no.

662
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,250
I'm a grifter...

663
00:40:50,192 --> 00:40:52,361
for better or worse.

664
00:40:54,164 --> 00:40:56,568
You're searching for something.

665
00:40:56,897 --> 00:40:58,333
Nate, I...

666
00:41:01,056 --> 00:41:04,211
Oh, I feel like
such an idiot, but...

667
00:41:06,737 --> 00:41:09,672
I feel a little bit lost right now.

668
00:41:13,916 --> 00:41:17,242
Just take your time.
Trust me.

669
00:41:19,129 --> 00:41:21,044
The irony of that.

670
00:41:21,754 --> 00:41:24,149
Right.
Trust me...

671
00:41:25,897 --> 00:41:28,779
'cause whatever you need,
I'm here for you.

672
00:41:29,174 --> 00:41:32,729
Listen, you carried my drunk ass
for over a year.

673
00:41:35,665 --> 00:41:38,472
You deserve some
of the same latitude.

674
00:41:41,263 --> 00:41:43,207
You make a good point.

675
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:47,679
Now, here is where you say...

676
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,495
something nice about me.

677
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,717
Don't ruin the moment.
