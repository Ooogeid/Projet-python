1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,000
the first priority for new England
is to get their defense healthy.

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,100
Their defense is fine, you morons.

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,600
They allowed an average
of 10 points per game last year.

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,500
...throw for, you know --

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,400
He was, what,
I think he was 7 of...

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,600
everybody down! Down!

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,100
Hell!

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,500
Oh, no!

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,000
Get away from the vehicle!

10
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,500
ugh!

11
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,500
Davai! Davai!
Davai! Davai! Davai!

12
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,300
I've been a cop with the Boston
P.D. For over 20 years.

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,400
My wife got laid off
a couple months ago,

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,800
So I picked up some shifts with
a security company to make ends meet.

15
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,000
Mr. Cospito, you were doing
a side job for Kerrity Diamonds?

16
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,600
Please, call me Joey.

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,900
I'm feeling like an old man
these days as it is.

18
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,200
I was hauling about $10
million in diamonds that day.

19
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,100
I'd done the same route five,
maybe six times before --

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,000
No problem.

21
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,800
Armored-Car drivers are supposed
to stay with the vehicle, right?

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,300
I'm a cop first.

23
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,800
My instinct was stop
a robbery in progress.

24
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,100
Hell of a job I did, huh?

25
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,400
One guard for a delivery that size?

26
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,200
Ah, these days, with companies
pinching anywhere they can,

27
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,600
Happens all the time.

28
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,300
It sounds to me
like an inside job.

29
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,700
Except they thought
the inside man was me.

30
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,700
Hey, I know --First
guy you look at

31
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,700
Is the blue-Collar guy
who's got money trouble.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,700
Until this investigation's
closed and my name is cleared,

33
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,300
I'm suspended from the
force without pay.

34
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,900
Yeah, although, not
much of an investigation.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,900
No witnesses, no prints.

36
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Trace elements of
the explosive they used,

37
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,900
Fast-Burning det cord.

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,000
Medical bills are piling up,

39
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,900
And there's no work for a guy with
a bum shoulder and an open investigation.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,600
All right, listen, Joey,

41
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,800
we're gonna do everything we
can to help you with that, all right?

42
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,900
Never thought it would be so tough

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,900
Just to try and keep a roof
over my family's head, you know?

44
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,900
Yeah.

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,500
Who's the other drink for?

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,900
Oh, that -- She's, uh...

47
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,000
Nobody.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,200
Jim Kerrity III --

57
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,200
He took over Kerrity diamonds
four years ago after his old man retired.

58
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,600
And in that small amount of time,

59
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,600
He managed to drive the business
straight into the ground

60
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,700
By living way beyond his means.

61
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,100
I'm talking drugs, booze, women.

62
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,800
According to his credit cards,
same as -- What? What? What?

63
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,500
-Why? What?
-What?

64
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,200
-What are you doing? What?
-What?

65
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,000
-What?
-It's distracting.

66
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,000
Well, the couch is just
feeling a little empty.

67
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,100
Eliot, will you please
sit next to parker?

68
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,100
No. Iím sitting here now.

69
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,100
Guys, guys, all right,
we all miss Sophie.

70
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
We just have to adapt.

71
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,400
-I got this. Move.
-Please.

72
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,400
-Go. Bye.
-Go.

73
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,900
You happy?

74
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,700
Now, Kerrity's finances
are a mess --

75
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,600
Maxed out,
maxed out, overdrawn.

76
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,000
Now, according to the insurance claim,

77
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,200
He stands to gain $9 million
from the armored-Car robbery.

78
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,100
You know, a guy like this,

79
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,100
You know, he gets in over his head,

80
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,400
And his insurance policy starts
to look pretty attractive.

81
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,600
Hires a couple of thugs,
knocks off his own truck.

82
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,000
It's a sweet payout, too.

83
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,200
He gets the insurance claim,
plus he still has the diamonds.

84
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,400
Mm-Hmm, and honest people
like Joey take the heat.

85
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,800
You know, the thing about this

86
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,700
That most people don't
understand is insurance fraud --

87
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,900
It's a lot of red tape.

88
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,300
I mean, a big claim like this --

89
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,700
It'll take about a year before
Kerrity sees any of the money.

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,800
And the bill collectors --
They're not gonna wait around.

91
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,700
-He's got to fence the diamonds.
-He can't.

92
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,800
What do you mean?

93
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,800
His diamonds are GIA-Certified,
VVS clarity, all about two carats.

94
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,900
That's my clicker.

95
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Who stole the polar star?

96
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,600
Who stole the gem of Gibraltar?

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,800
Damiani raid? Me.

98
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,200
I know diamonds.

99
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,400
And our bad guy can't fence those diamonds

100
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,600
Because stones that size have an
I.D. Number laser-Inscribed on them.

101
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh, so, itís like a stolen car.

102
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,700
You got to clean the vin
before you can sell them.

103
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,100
How do you get
that I.D. Number off?

104
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,300
With a special laser,
but only three guys can do it --

105
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,900
Antwerp, Dubai, Tel Aviv.

106
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,000
And as of right now,
Boston, right?

107
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,700
I mean, Kerrity
has to move his diamonds,

108
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,600
So we convince him
that we're the only people

109
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,200
Who can make them clean enough to move.

110
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,100
Get them to bring the diamonds to us.

111
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
And when he shows up --

112
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,200
Oh, Hardison, can you put
the crime-Scene photos...

113
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,400
Can -- Can...

114
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,300
State police guy,
lieutenant Bonanno.

115
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,100
Yeah. So, we drop Kerrity on his
lap with the stolen diamonds.

116
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,200
Lieutenant Bonanno
drops the hammer.

117
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,400
Our guy gets cleared,
gets his job back.

118
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,100
Pardon me, but I don't mean
to stop the fun train --

119
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,700
We're out a grifter here.

120
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,700
I know who we can call.

121
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,600
No, we're not gonna call Sophie.

122
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,100
No, she has asked for space,
and we're gonna honor that.

123
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,900
No.

124
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,700
Hardison, you're gonna be our grifter.

125
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,600
-I'm listening.
-What? No, no, no.

126
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,300
-Parker, youíll be the roper.
-What?

127
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,800
Cute dress, heels --
You'll be fine.

128
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,700
Sure. Iíll be fine.

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,600
Eliot, you be the muscle.

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,400
-Hi.
-Hello.

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,900
Buy me a drink?

132
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,200
You got it.

133
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,700
So...

134
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,000
Aah!

135
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,400
Ugh!

136
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,600
Aah!

137
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,200
parker? Parker?

138
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,500
Aah!

139
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,900
Yeah, Iíll be fine.

140
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,200
I will not be fine.

141
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,100
I stabbed that guy with a fork!

142
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,400
Parker, parker, relax.
It's fine.

143
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,200
Listen, go to Nateís
storage cupboard,

144
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,100
And you're gonna find
a sexy little mini dress

145
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,000
And my emergency jimmy choose.

146
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,700
Jimmy who?

147
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,700
You have a body
in Nateís closet?

148
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,100
Shoes, parker!

149
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Didn't I teach you any--

150
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,900
All right, listen,
okay, this is the important bit.

151
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,100
Do you still have the Rosalind
diamond you stole in Perth?

152
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,100
Yes.

153
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,300
Wear it.

154
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,200
The diamond will speak for you.

155
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,400
You won't have to say a word.

156
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,600
This is the key to the grift.

157
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,600
You just trust the character.

158
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,900
Say nothing. Trust the diamond.

159
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,700
I can do that.

160
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,900
Don't tell Nate I called.

161
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,800
I won't.

162
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,000
Where's the mark?

163
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,500
Kerrity's at the bar --
Gold Rolex, purple tie.

164
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,800
Say nothing. Trust the diamond.

165
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,200
Say nothing and trust the diamond.

166
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,200
Parker, what are you saying?

167
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,700
Nothing and trusting the diamond.

168
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,400
I'll have an Appletini.

169
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
-They make them strong here.
-Oh, do they?

170
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,600
Is that an Australian pink diamond?

171
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,200
Is that the Rosalind?

172
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,600
That's an impressive,
uh, replica.

173
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,100
It's the original.

174
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,900
I'll have to take
your word for it.

175
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,400
I have people who certify
these things for me.

176
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,400
"do you want to take a closer..."

177
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,300
You want a closer look?

178
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,500
No stabbing, parker.

179
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,200
This is a very famous diamond.

180
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,600
How did you get it?

181
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,300
It was a gift
from my boyfriend.

182
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,200
Ah.

183
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,400
He works in diamonds.

184
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,000
So do I, and I would love
to talk shop with the man

185
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,600
who managed to get his
hands on the, uh...

186
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,500
The Rosalind diamond.

187
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,700
-no.
-N--

188
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Come here.
What have I said?

189
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,600
What have I said
about new people? Huh?

190
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,500
What have I said?

191
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,500
Hey, it's okay.
This guy works in diamonds.

192
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,800
He wants to talk
business or something.

193
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,900
All right.

194
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,000
Lay the arms down, brother.

195
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,100
He's cool.

196
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,600
You'll have to
excuse my bodyguard.

197
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,100
He's touchy.

198
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,400
It's because he's a
mute, all right?

199
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,000
Yeah, well, my bodyguards
don't talk much, either.

200
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,200
Well, looks like we found
our armored-Car robbers.

201
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,000
Gonna shoot through
your own mate, then?

202
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,000
To be honest with you,
I never liked him.

203
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,100
Legit. Goon
squad and all, innit?

204
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,600
Stand down.

205
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,500
Jim Kerrity.

206
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,900
You're Jim Kerrity --
Kerrity diamonds?

207
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,800
oh, no.

208
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,400
Brother, you got
hit hard last week.

209
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,600
The heist, yes.
That was me.

210
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,600
So, did you use the Romanovs
back there or just hire out?

211
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,600
I'm in the business, jimmy boy.
I can smell an inside job.

212
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
So, what do you do
in the business, mister...

213
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm a thief.

214
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,500
They call me "the ice man."

215
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,500
"ice man"?

216
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,300
No, Hardison, you have to have
a light touch. Undersell.

217
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,000
What kind of a thief
calls himself a thief?

218
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,700
An uncatchable one
with a brilliant reputation.

219
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,500
You've seen my work in Perth.

220
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,900
The polar star?
Nicked it.

221
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,400
The gem of Gibraltar?
Nicked it.

222
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,100
The Damiani raid?

223
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,600
Distraction while I nicked
everything in the vault next door.

224
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Big stones, trust me.

225
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,800
Yeah, well, then, I shouldn't
be seen talking to you.

226
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,200
Right, right, right,

227
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,400
'cause two criminals can't
talk business while shooting pool.

228
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,700
Bitch of it is,
nicking them's butter --

229
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,600
Moving them's the pain.

230
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,100
Yes, especially with
those inscribed I.D. Numbers.

231
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,800
No, no, no, no.
I got this laser, see?

232
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,700
Only one in this
country, mind you.

233
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,200
This thing I had to bring over Piece
by sodding piece from Turkmenistan.

234
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,200
It can scrub an I.D.
Clean off any diamond --

235
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,300
Re-virginized.

236
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,200
And what kind of fee do you charge
for such a specialized service?

237
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,200
30%.

238
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,900
-5%.
-30%.

239
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,000
No way in hell.

240
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,900
See, that's the
discounted rate, brother,

241
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,000
'Cause anything lower than
that is an insulted rate,

242
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,700
'Cause it's an insult
to me, savvy?

243
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,500
You, uh...you ring me
when you wisen up, yeah?

244
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,000
Thanks...

245
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,100
But no thanks, brother.

246
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,000
ice man?

247
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,100
-hey, I put a lot of work into that character.
-Seriously?

248
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,300
No, no, no, no.

249
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,500
I bought new clothes --
Ugly as hell, too.

250
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,500
-This always happens when you go on the grift, Hardison, okay?
-I-I put stories on the website.

251
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,900
You go way too big.

252
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah, Sophie told me to say
as little as possible.

253
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,300
Let the character do the work.

254
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,500
When did, uh,
Sophie say that?

255
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,600
A long time ago.

256
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,100
Maybe last Christmas.

257
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,600
I don't even think
it was Sophie.

258
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,300
I'm gonna go put
more pressure on Kerrity.

259
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,800
I want you guys to
be on the clear-Out.

260
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,100
Ice man, play it cool.

261
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,800
That's just
an awful, awful name.

262
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,700
-Genius.
-See?

263
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,700
It's genius.

264
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,000
When you get in
too deep on this,

265
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,500
I ain't bailing
your ass out.

266
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,300
I don't need you
to bail me out.

267
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Iím the ice man.

268
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,200
Not...gonna...help.

269
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,900
We did our job,
and you haven't paid.

270
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,100
I told you --
You do the job,

271
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,300
The insurance pays out,
and then you get your 10%.

272
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,100
Sell the diamonds while you wait
for the insurance money, hmm?

273
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,100
Use the Englishman
to launder them.

274
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,100
Yeah, Iíll do that when his 30%
comes out of your 10%.

275
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,200
You know that is a mathematical
impossibility, hmm?

276
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,200
There's a Mr. Sterling here
from the insurance company.

277
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,200
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

278
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,300
He's probably here
to drop off a check, okay?

279
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,900
Get out of here.
I'll call you.

280
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,300
Come on. Come on.

281
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,100
Yes!

282
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,500
Mr. Sterling, Iím, uh, Iím Jim Kerrity.

283
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,800
So glad you could stop by.

284
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,200
I just wanted
to introduce myself.

285
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,200
Your claim has raised
a lot of red flags,

286
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,800
And Iím in the
red-Flag department.

287
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,700
My company has asked me
to review your entire policy,

288
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,100
Just to make sure
no mistakes were made.

289
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,600
I can assure you that nobody
takes security more seriously than I do.

290
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,600
In fact, that's the reason
I hired what I was told

291
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,600
Was the best armored-Car
service in town.

292
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,500
My vault has
a seismic sensor.

293
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,000
No other company
in Boston has that.

294
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,600
Yeah, well, Iím sure all that will be taken
into consideration, Mr. Kerrity, yes, mm-Hmm.

295
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,400
Good. So, uh, how long
do you think this is gonna take?

296
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,900
'Cause Iíve got a
business to run here.

297
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,000
Assuming no problems arise,

298
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,200
You should expect to
see a check in, uh...

299
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Oh, seven to nine...

300
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,700
Days?

301
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,600
months.

302
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,700
Mm. Yeah.

303
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,800
Wow.

304
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,700
Well...

305
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,000
I'll be in touch.

306
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Mm-Hmm. Mm-Hmm.

307
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:31,900
I know.

308
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,800
He's driving me crazy.

309
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,000
How, huh? I'm backup.
They can't rely on me.

310
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,700
All right.

311
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,200
All right.

312
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,000
Hey...

313
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,500
Thanks.

314
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,900
Don't tell Nate I called.

315
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:51,900
Who was that?

316
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,600
Cable company.

317
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,500
Whoa! Whoa!
What are you people doing here?

318
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,800
We work here.
Who are you?

319
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,600
We're with Osha.

320
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,100
We issued a class-1 evacuation notice
for this facility, effective 24 hours ago.

321
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,300
This place is on lockdown
for chemical exposure.

322
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,200
Did nobody read the memo?

323
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,500
Did nobody read the memo?!

324
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,100
You, cough!

325
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
what chemicals?

326
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,700
Given the setup
for this place,

327
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,200
It could be a matrix of
solid-Phase sulfates, nitrates --

328
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,300
That's inside me?

329
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,800
Honey, your lungs are
a parking lot, sweetheart.

330
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,100
And in that parking lot,

331
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,500
The diagonal lines
are painted with poison.

332
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,100
People, move towards the door.

333
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,300
All right?

334
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,900
Do not inhale unless you are
at least 50 feet from the entrance!

335
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,400
This should all be taken care of
by tomorrow, so nothing...

336
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,800
okay, Iíve got a visual.

337
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,600
Where is Mr. Ice?

338
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,000
He's late.

339
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,700
He's always late.

340
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,800
Oh.

341
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,000
Hmm. Subtle.

342
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,700
The ice man cometh.

343
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,500
Let me introduce you
to my laser, Glinda.

344
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,600
You see, Iíve found that laser fluences

345
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,000
below the diamond graphitization
threshold are most effective.

346
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,400
Wouldn't you say?

347
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,600
Yeah.

348
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,300
Did you bring the diamond?

349
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,000
Two carats, very few flaws --
My salesman said.

350
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,200
She's a beaut.

351
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,400
Sheila, get us a pop.

352
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,800
Because this would be classified I.F.,

353
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,400
An internally flawless,
two-Carat round cut diamond,

354
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,100
It should be easier to oblate.

355
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,800
you got that, parker?

356
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,000
How is this gonna fool him?

357
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,700
He's not looking
at the diamond.

358
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,400
He's looking
at the I.D. Number.

359
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,600
I.D. Numbers are etched at a
depth Between 5 and 7 microns.

360
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,800
Using nanoblation, The U.V.
Laser pulses irradiate the etching.

361
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,100
Thank you, sweets.

362
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,900
Should be about done.

363
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,700
It's like it was never there.

364
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I could do the rest in a day,

365
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,600
But Iím only here
for another week.

366
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
I've got a thing in Antwerp.

367
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,900
All right, well, let's --
Let's do it tomorrow?

368
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,800
-Done.
-Excellent.

369
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,000
Mr. Ice.

370
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,600
All right, nice work, guys.

371
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,300
Tomorrow, when he shows up
with the diamonds,

372
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,200
The state police will be there.

373
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Why? So they can
arrest Harrisonís ego?

374
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,700
be cool, baby -- Ice cool.

375
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,400
Hey, who wants to go for a spin?

376
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,100
I can't believe
you rented a Ferrari.

377
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,000
Rented? Iíll get
a ride home with Eliot.

378
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,800
Y'all are just jealous.

379
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,200
Oh, they're just jealous, baby.

380
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,700
Don't worry about that.

381
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,600
Look at you --
Looking better than green...

382
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,300
You, my friend, are the
answer to all my problems.

383
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,700
what exactly are we celebrating?

384
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,900
We are...stealing
Kerrityís diamonds...

385
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,900
...again!

386
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,300
You guys are gonna
scrump his jewels?

387
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,600
No, not you guys --
Us guys.

388
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,600
We know where the diamonds
are kept in the vault.

389
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,600
We need someone to bust
the diamonds out of the vault.

390
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,600
That's ??

391
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,900
??

392
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,700
We're going tonight.

393
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,200
You clean the stones
with your laser.

394
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,400
We sell them
and make a ton of money.

395
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,200
Diamond Jim is dropping
the stones by my lab tomorrow.

396
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,600
Why don't you just
pick it up in transit?

397
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,800
Is that what the ice man would do, huh?

398
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,900
It's not really
my style, but --

399
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,500
Too many variables. We have
a way in and out of a vault.

400
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,000
We take diamonds in a
controlled situation.

401
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,600
We'll be a long way gone

402
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,300
Before Kerrity notices he's been robbed.

403
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,600
What?

404
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,600
Is there a problem?

405
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,200
No.

406
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,300
To our success.

407
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,100
Nostrovya.

408
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,200
Yeah, um, cheers, mate.

409
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,000
I need -- I need to
make a quick call,

410
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,700
Bug the old lady, let her know Iím not
making it in tonight. You know birds.

411
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,600
Of course.

412
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,900
Yeah, yeah.

413
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,300
Sheila, not making it in tonight.

414
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,700
Yeah, work thing. Bugger all.

415
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,800
Hardison?

416
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,500
Are you calling me in character?

417
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,400
I told you, butternut, it's work.

418
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,500
I can't get out of it.

419
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
What accent is that?

420
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,700
Ooh, you --
You've been nabbed.

421
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,000
- Afraid so.
- Is it the mark?

422
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,400
No. No, muffin, no.

423
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,000
Oh, it's the goons.

424
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,300
You oversold the part.

425
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,200
You fell into the trap of
the overzealous henchmen.

426
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,800
Look, don't worry about
it. It happens all the time.

427
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,300
Just -- Well, as long
as they're not Russians.

428
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,200
It's gonna be a bit of a problem.

429
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,800
Is it the Russians? I'm
gonna have to phone Nate.

430
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,600
Leave it off, crumpet.

431
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,000
No, no, no, no, no, listen, Hardison,

432
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,300
You -- You cannot talk
your way out of Russians.

433
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,800
I mean, you -- You can
stall them, maybe, for a bit.

434
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,500
But whatever you do, do not tell
them you can do anything else.

435
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,900
Smooches.

436
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,400
Love her.

437
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,300
So, do these other
blokes talk, or just you?

438
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,100
No.

439
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,200
Let me show you the plan.

440
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,000
Hey, Hardison, I just got
an interesting phone call.

441
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,100
Sophie tells me you've been
recruited by the Russians.

442
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,800
I had courtside seats, man.

443
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,200
Tell Hardison if he makes it out alive,

444
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,400
I'm gonna snap him in half.

445
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,200
Uh, Eliot says "hi."

446
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,000
So, what's the plan there, ice man?

447
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,500
Just so Iím clear,
you want me to help you

448
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,000
Break into Kerrityís vault
and steal his diamonds.

449
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh, beautiful.

450
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,500
We blow the floor of the
vault and climb through.

451
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,200
So, what you're saying is

452
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,800
We're gonna explode through the
ceiling of the tunnel using det cord

453
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,500
And climb into the
vault through the floor.

454
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,000
Yes.

455
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,500
This is what I just say.

456
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,600
Det cord -- That's how
they blew the armored truck.

457
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,200
Exploding through the floor
will set the seismic sensor off.

458
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,300
The tunnel's a terrible way in.

459
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,400
Hardison, you're gonna have to
tell them their plan won't work.

460
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
The tunnel is a horrible way in.

461
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,000
I heard you, parker.

462
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,400
Yeah, you know, Iím -- I'm -- I'm
-- I'm sor-- I'm sorry, comrades,

463
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,900
But your plan is ronk.

464
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,300
See, the explosion will
trip the seismic sensor.

465
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,000
We'll have the feds on
our arses in no time.

466
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,200
Well, then, the world's greatest thief

467
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,700
Have to take us another way, hmm?

468
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,500
Yeah.

469
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
I'll get you into Kerrityís vault.

470
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,900
No need to be pissy, mate.

471
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh, yes, of course you will.

472
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,800
Now, listen, Hardison, you're
gonna have to figure out a way

473
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,900
To buy some time so we
can get you out of this.

474
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,300
Yeah, get busy.

475
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,100
Guys, guys, I can't make any
sense of Hardison's files.

476
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,400
You can't track him, man. He's
usually the one that does the tracking.

477
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,800
Yeah, well, maybe he left it on, huh?

478
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,000
- What if we just tell him to make a run for it?
- Well, they'll kill him.

479
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,800
Well, if he goes along with their
plan now, they'll get arrested.

480
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,600
Look, we got to find another
way for Hardison to break in.

481
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,500
- We need a closer look at the vault.
- Yeah, Iím working on it. I-I...

482
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,000
here -- Hair spray.
You're gonna need this.

483
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,700
Let me ask you a question, man. If Hardison
helps these Russians steal the evidence,

484
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,400
How are we gonna prove that
Kerrity set up the robbery?

485
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm working on it. I-I...

486
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,000
do not call Sophie.

487
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,700
Mr. Sterling...

488
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,100
good news, I hope.

489
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,800
Well, it's too early to tell.

490
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,300
The claim is on your jeweler's
block coverage policy.

491
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,100
In order to verify the
eligibility of your coverage,

492
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,100
I'm gonna need to see your vault.

493
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,100
I'm sure you understand,
if there's any discrepancy

494
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,100
Between what you say your security is

495
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,100
And what your security actually is,

496
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,400
Well, that would invalidate the claim.

497
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,700
I can assure you my vault
is as good as I claim.

498
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,700
All right, all right.

499
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,400
I'll show it to you myself. Come on.

500
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,800
13-Ton
steel door --

501
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,000
Can withstand 12 hours of drilling.

502
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,200
Now, the door can withstand
up to 12 hours' drilling.

503
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,800
You can't use force.

504
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
The lock has a million
possible combinations,

505
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,300
And Iím the only one
who knows the combo.

506
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,300
The magnetic sensors are deactivated

507
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,100
By punching a color
code into the RGB keypad.

508
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,400
If he has an RGB keypad, we're buggered.

509
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,900
They're unhackable.

510
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,100
RGB keypad? Let me see.

511
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,100
Move the camera left. No, vault left.

512
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,400
All right. Then you
have to do this my way.

513
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,400
Remove the sensor while keeping
the magnetic field intact.

514
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,700
You're going to need a 4-Inch...

515
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,000
...a 4-Inch by 4-Inch
aluminum plate,

516
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,300
Double-Sided tape, and a
Philips-Head screwdriver.

517
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,800
Come on.

518
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,300
Got it.

519
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,000
Pressure-Sensitive tiles,

520
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,500
Disabled with the keypad right here.

521
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,600
Two cameras. Who monitors the feeds?

522
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,400
The guard upstairs
-- 24 hours a day.

523
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,400
I also have a monitor in my office.

524
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,700
Hmm. Heat sensors, motion sensors?

525
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,900
Yes, but to minimize false alarms,

526
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,600
The alarm only goes off if both
heat and motion are detected.

527
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,900
The keypad over there disables them.

528
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,500
Please?

529
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,400
Hardison's not gonna be able to do
anything if the heat sensors are on.

530
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,000
Nate, use the hair spray.

531
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,100
It creates a film that blocks the heat.

532
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:32,600
Heat sensor over here, and
this is the seismic sensor.

533
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,500
Any sound louder than my
voice, and it triggers.

534
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,700
The alarm will sound.

535
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,300
You know, I noticed your
box-Numbering system is off.

536
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,500
It goes from 82 to 84.

537
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,700
It's -- Yes, it's
very, uh, strange.

538
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,100
It's, um...

539
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,400
ah, it's right here.

540
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,700
Oh, there it is. 83.

541
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,600
Sorry. My mistake.

542
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,500
Of course. What's that?

543
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,900
Security fog.

544
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,900
If the alarm triggers,
that door locks down,

545
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,500
And the vault fills with a
glycol-Based, nontransparent fog.

546
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,000
Visibility is zero.

547
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,400
You can't steal what you can't see.

548
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,700
And the fog is triggered by the floor?

549
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,500
Triple-Wired. It'll go off
at the touch of the tiles,

550
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,900
The motion sensor,
and the seismic sensor.

551
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,300
Lockdown, full fog, cops on the way.

552
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,700
You are very proud of your security
system, aren't you, Mr. Kerrity?

553
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,100
I spare no expense, Mr. Sterling.

554
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,800
How bad is it?

555
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,400
There's no way Hardisonís gonna
be able to break into that vault.

556
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,300
What is Hardison gonna do?

557
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,300
No, Hardison is gonna pretend
to break into the vault.

558
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,000
Yeah, well, hopefully, the Russians
will only pretend to kill him.

559
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,200
No one's getting killed.

560
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,300
We're gonna break in for him.

561
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,700
All right, we're gonna
do this quick and dirty.

562
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,700
You guys break into the
vault before Hardison does

563
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,400
So the Russians think he's doing it.

564
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,900
Why not? He's been taking credit
for my work all day anyway.

565
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,400
And then Hardison will lead the Russians
into the vault a few paces behind you.

566
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,400
Hey, I got something.

567
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,900
Hardison must have hacked into
the security feed before he left.

568
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,100
Well, well.

569
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,000
I'm just gonna have keep
Kerrity out of his own vault.

570
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,200
So...brilliant plan to get us inside?

571
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,900
Oh, believe it.

572
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:18,800
So, uh...what deposit box
are the stolen diamonds in?

573
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,900
You get us in...

574
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,800
we'll tell you.

575
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
Wow, that looks beautiful.

576
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,200
$300,000 on your neck.

577
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,300
Oh, Amy, Iím gonna meet you
at the bar, sweetie, okay?

578
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,700
You'll earn that later. Let's go.

579
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,900
Excellent. This had better be important.

580
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,700
Yeah. Can we talk somewhere private?

581
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,800
When did he get here?

582
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,800
Yo, yo. Late night, man.

583
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,800
Is there a register
Iím supposed to look at?

584
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
Sorry, buddy.

585
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,000
Okay, parker, you're
clear. Come on down.

586
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,600
The, uh, inspection of your
vault did reveal a few issues.

587
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,800
The magnetic sensor is an s-2000.

588
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,100
That's right. It's the latest one.

589
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,200
Sorry, but, uh, your policy indicates

590
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,500
That it is an s-950 model,

591
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,900
And that, my friend, is a discrepancy.

592
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,900
It's a better version.

593
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,000
Yeah, well, no, I mean,
Mr. Kerrity, you know,

594
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,600
Given this new -- Uh,
this new information,

595
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,100
I'm sure that my company will most
certainly deny your, uh, your claim.

596
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,700
Look, I could be drinking champagne with a
tall brunette sitting in my lap right now.

597
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,500
Why'd you have to come here
and tell me this tonight?

598
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:56,200
Well, I came down here tonight to
present to you a-A different option --

599
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,200
You know, one that, uh, you know,

600
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,800
I have to tell you about in person.

601
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,300
This will hold them together.

602
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,000
Electric's faster.

603
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,800
The vibrations will set
off the seismic sensor.

604
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Eliot, approaching the building.
Approaching the building.

605
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,400
Wait here, right?

606
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,500
I've got to handle the
initial break-In myself.

607
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,600
Too many cooks and all.

608
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,900
Oi, delivery.

609
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,900
Next time, Iím playing the thief.

610
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,900
I'd like to hear you do an accent.

611
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,200
???

612
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,700
I went to second city in Chicago.

613
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,100
When did you find time between
that and karate at the y?

614
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,100
You know what? Shut up.
Just -- Just shut up. Just --

615
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,200
Shut up, guys.

616
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,000
A private arrangement
could be made, you know,

617
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,300
To, uh, perhaps ease some
of the -- The paperwork.

618
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,300
Are you talking about a bribe?

619
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,500
No, no, no, listen,

620
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,900
I prefer to look at
it as a processing fee.

621
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,700
Yeah, an agreement between two
gentlemen who understand each other.

622
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,800
Lay down. Stop moving. Stop moving.

623
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,600
How about that?

624
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,400
Idiot.

625
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,600
Stuck it.

626
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,200
This little baby will
deactivate the magnetic sensors.

627
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,500
Smells like...patchouli.

628
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,400
Does it?

629
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,100
Parker wrote the combination in
invisible ink on the door next to you.

630
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,100
She's in there, but she hasn't
deactivated the floor yet.

631
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,200
Take your time with the tumblers.

632
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
You are really everything you claimed.

633
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,300
Sorry?

634
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,800
I said, "you're really
everything you claimed."

635
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,400
If Iím lying, Iím dying.

636
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,600
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

637
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,300
I'm sorry. Just to say
in English -- Very tricky.

638
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,200
Hardison, slow down.

639
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,600
You're breezing through
that combo lock way too fast.

640
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,200
Parker, what's your E.T.A.?

641
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,800
Not ready yet. Floor's still hot.

642
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,400
Nate, our timing's not gonna work out.

643
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,600
Look, Kerrity, you know, you could have
the insurance company process your claim

644
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,000
And, you know, go through it
by the book and everything,

645
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
And I guarantee you
you'll see your money,

646
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,200
Just as soon as hell freezes over.

647
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,200
Or...

648
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,600
or you accept my alternative terms,

649
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,800
And, you know, we, uh, we both win.

650
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,000
Who do you think you are, huh?

651
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,600
They let you out of your little
insurance cubicle once a year

652
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,300
To hustle honest customers?

653
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,000
Look, Kerrity, you know,
you and I both know --

654
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,800
You come in here way after hours,

655
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,400
Thinking you can extort me for a bribe?!

656
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,200
Get the hell out of here!

657
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,000
Parker, you've got to get a move on.

658
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,400
Nate and Hardison are way ahead of you.

659
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,000
Okay, the floor is clear.

660
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,100
Nate, parker's still in the vault.

661
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,700
Get the hell out of my office!

662
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,400
No, Iím -- I'm
not going anywhere.

663
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,100
Are you gonna finish this up, Mr. Ice?

664
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,300
Right, right. Yeah, sure. Just...

665
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,900
there it goes. Got it. I found it.

666
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,900
I found it.

667
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,600
I need 60 seconds.

668
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,700
Well, can you turn
invisible in 60 seconds?

669
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,700
'Cause they're busting in there.

670
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,800
Parker, you're out of time.

671
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:34,800
I'm not ready.

672
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,400
???

673
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,800
Box 72.

674
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,500
I'm on it.

675
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,900
- She didn't crack those.
- What?

676
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,800
She didn't have time.
You moved too fast.

677
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,100
You're gonna have to improvise.

678
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,100
"What?" What?

679
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,200
Do you mind? Personal space.

680
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,300
What part of "get the hell out
of my office" don't you get?

681
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,500
Mr. Kerrity, Iím in insurance.

682
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,500
Now, if you think that Iíve never
been threatened by a firearm before,

683
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,900
- You're quite mistaken.
- Oh, yeah?

684
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,800
Well, why don't you consider this
gun your little security escort?

685
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,500
What the hell?

686
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,900
Is this a setup?

687
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,200
Guys, uh, Kerrityís on his way down.

688
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,800
Oh, what? What? Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

689
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,600
Did you hear that?

690
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,200
Diamond Jimís coming down here.

691
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,500
You -- You go and stop him
while I nick the diamonds.

692
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,000
Hey, what the -- What
the hell's going on here?!

693
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,500
What are you doing here?

694
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,500
We're taking matters into our own hands.

695
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:55,200
Instead of 10%, 100%,
minus, uh, his cut.

696
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,800
Where is he?!

697
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,800
What the hell's going on?!

698
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,500
What is this?

699
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,500
The security system.
What the hell was that?

700
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,500
Shh! Did you hear that?

701
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,800
Diamond Jimís coming down here.

702
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,400
You -- You go and stop him
while I nick the diamonds.

703
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,100
Thank you. And I mean thank you.

704
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,200
But how are we getting out of here?

705
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,500
What is that? Shh.

706
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,500
Pull your arms in.

707
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,800
Det cord.

708
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,000
Against the wall!

709
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,300
What is that --
A gun? Drop it.

710
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,400
Mr. Kerrity, it's a hell of
a month you're having, huh?

711
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,100
I mean, first, a $9
million armored-Car heist,

712
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,500
And now this?

713
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,200
What are you doing here?

714
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,700
Well, your alarm was activated.

715
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,100
See, and that notifies the
local police, which notifies me.

716
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,400
Right, but you don't have to
worry about anything, lieutenant.

717
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,300
It was a -- It
was a false alarm.

718
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,100
Yeah, we've taken care of it.

719
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,500
You guys -- You guys don't have to
stick around anymore. You can go.

720
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,000
Uh, we tried to stop a robbery.

721
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Box 72.

722
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,400
It's empty.

723
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,300
Now, you said in your report

724
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,700
That your last shipment of loose
diamonds was stolen en route.

725
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,900
And what do you know?

726
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,700
That's the same logo as
the armored-Car company.

727
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,400
But Iím sure when we
check these diamonds out,

728
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,000
I mean, they're not gonna have the
same I.D. Numbers as the missing ice.

729
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,200
I'm sure of that.

730
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,300
Are you sure of that, Mr. Kerrity?

731
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,700
Thought we couldn't use this tunnel.

732
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,400
The tunnel's a horrible way in...

733
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,200
...but it's a great way out.

734
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,400
Your name's been totally cleared.

735
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,300
I'm back on the force as of Monday.

736
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,100
Shoulder's pretty much healed up, too.

737
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,100
Excellent. Kerrity
and his goons --

738
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,500
They went down for
insurance fraud and theft.

739
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,600
Business has basically collapsed.

740
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:52,600
And, uh, we, uh, we managed to
retrieve something from the wreckage

741
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,900
For, uh, you know, help
with your medical costs.

742
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,400
Where'd this come from?

743
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,000
Should be about done.

744
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,100
It's like it wasn't even there.

745
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,500
What are you smiling at?
You still screwed it up.

746
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,000
I'm smiling 'cause you said if I
got in trouble, you wouldn't help me.

747
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,500
- Parker made me.
- No, I didn't.

748
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,900
Come on, man. Let's hug it out.

749
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,200
I'm not hugging it out, ice man.

750
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,700
Just hug it -- Just
a little man hug.

751
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,800
I'm not hugging it out with you.

752
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,500
No, it's
not --

753
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,400
Man, just sit down on your stool.

754
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,700
- Just don't make this --
- What are you doing, man?

755
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,300
- This is uncomfortable
now. - Just don't -- Dude.

756
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,900
- Get in the pits, man. Get in the pits.
- I'm gonna break your frickin' arm.

757
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,900
Not you, too, huh?

758
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,100
Sorry. What -- What
do you mean me, too?

759
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,700
Well, you've been captured by Russians?

760
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,000
Oh, yeah, that.

761
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
That could have gone
better, no question.

762
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,400
It worked out, though.

763
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,900
Oh, it worked out
just fine without me --

764
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,600
Is that what you're saying?

765
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,400
No, no, no, Iím
not -- I'm not --

766
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,500
I'm not saying that at all, no.

767
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,000
No, I just want to say, uh...

768
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,800
to say what?

769
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,100
I just wanted to say Iím sorry...

770
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,400
for bugging you, um...

771
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,300
and for them calling
-- For them calling.

772
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,900
I-I won't let that happen again. I...

773
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,700
listen, call whenever you want.

774
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,100
You know...

775
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,500
bye.
