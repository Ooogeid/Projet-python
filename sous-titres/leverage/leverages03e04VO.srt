Season 3 Episode 4
<i>The Scheherazade Job</i>

2
00:00:07,011 --> 00:00:08,912
This is my homeland.

3
00:00:09,928 --> 00:00:10,928
Wadata.

4
00:00:11,499 --> 00:00:13,899
You may not have heard of it,
but you will.

5
00:00:14,618 --> 00:00:16,933
We are rich in resources.

6
00:00:17,746 --> 00:00:18,746
Diamonds,

7
00:00:19,396 --> 00:00:22,440
and a newly discovered
oil field offshore.

8
00:00:23,662 --> 00:00:25,854
But while we are rich in resources,

9
00:00:25,979 --> 00:00:27,568
we are poor in leadership.

10
00:00:27,925 --> 00:00:29,854
My brother, the president,

11
00:00:29,979 --> 00:00:31,179
is a good man,

12
00:00:31,806 --> 00:00:33,348
But he does not have the will

13
00:00:33,473 --> 00:00:36,490
to make our country
attractive to investors.

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:37,956
I do.

15
00:00:38,753 --> 00:00:41,886
Mr. Moto, your brother
is a very popular leader.

16
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:44,009
How confident are you...

17
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:45,753
that you can succeed him?

18
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:48,591
Some have tried
to stop our progress...

19
00:00:49,252 --> 00:00:51,236
But we are making every effort

20
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:53,600
to resolve these conflicts.

21
00:00:54,963 --> 00:00:56,129
You tell Mr. Moto

22
00:00:56,254 --> 00:00:59,467
that Jane Akinyemi
from the West Africa newswire called...

23
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:00,534
again.

24
00:01:08,463 --> 00:01:09,819
Wait, this is not for my car.

25
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,024
The rich and powerful
take what they want.

26
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,458
We steal it back for you.

27
00:01:32,305 --> 00:01:35,970
Sometimes, bad guys
make the best good guys.

28
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,816
We provide leverage.

29
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:44,471
Damn it, Hardison.

30
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:46,700
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

31
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:48,604
Nate asked me to come
to the client meeting

32
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:51,327
N'cause somebody tried to kill her.
What are you doing here?

33
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:54,029
I thought "Take your daughter
to work" day was last week.

34
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:56,967
I'm here to check out what Nate does
for when I run my own crew one day.

35
00:01:57,092 --> 00:01:58,478
Wait, wait.

36
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,279
Hardison,
that's why you wanted to come?

37
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:03,984
What do you mean, "No"?
I am the super-skrull.

38
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:07,260
I have all y'all's skills.
I hack, I grift, I thieve.

39
00:02:07,385 --> 00:02:08,535
Do you fight?

40
00:02:08,807 --> 00:02:10,616
I have a dog for that.
Name's Megabite.

41
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:13,309
You can't do what I do.

42
00:02:13,652 --> 00:02:16,802
- Why, you think I'm not smart enough?
- No, you're smart enough.

43
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,040
- That's the easy part.
- What's the hard part?

44
00:02:19,476 --> 00:02:20,331
Jane.

45
00:02:20,456 --> 00:02:21,934
- Hello.
- Nice to see you again.

46
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,626
I'd like you to meet my associates here,
Eliot Spencer and Alec Hardison. Please.

47
00:02:28,443 --> 00:02:30,483
Those men have been following me.

48
00:02:41,065 --> 00:02:42,065
Say, man,

49
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:44,991
I think that's my jacket
that you got on.

50
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,582
Back off.

51
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:49,057
Look, I left it too long
at the dry cleaners.

52
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:51,156
You can't just give away
somebody's jacket.

53
00:02:51,281 --> 00:02:53,923
This is my jacket.
If I could just get it back from you.

54
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,050
Yeah, I liked it.
My mom gave it to me.

55
00:02:58,202 --> 00:03:00,262
I said: "Back off."

56
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,188
What's up?

57
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,063
Excuse me.

58
00:03:19,746 --> 00:03:20,696
Thank you.

59
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:37,463
Can your dog do that?

60
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,610
The conditions there are deplorable.

61
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:44,110
When the children who work
in Mr. Moto's diamond mine

62
00:03:44,235 --> 00:03:47,641
meet their quota,
they earn $1.50 a day.

63
00:03:48,273 --> 00:03:51,734
- When they don't, they go hungry.
- Yeah, or worse.

64
00:03:54,323 --> 00:03:55,976
I've fought in these countries.

65
00:03:56,101 --> 00:03:57,630
I've seen these kids.

66
00:03:57,755 --> 00:03:59,313
You make it out of the mine,

67
00:03:59,589 --> 00:04:01,365
then you get an M-16
in the rebel army.

68
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:04,885
And Mr. Moto, he smuggles
his diamonds into the US,

69
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,663
and then he launders them through his
real-estate holdings here in Boston.

70
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:11,791
- It pays to have a brother president.
- The president is a good man,

71
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:15,273
who has worked hard to raise
the standard of living for our people.

72
00:04:15,576 --> 00:04:17,772
But his brother is very smart.

73
00:04:18,454 --> 00:04:19,882
He covers his tracks.

74
00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:21,468
That is why he'll win.

75
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:24,805
This money that Alexander's saving...
This is for a coup?

76
00:04:25,238 --> 00:04:26,348
No. An election.

77
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:30,162
Term limits will force his brother out
in less than a year.

78
00:04:30,287 --> 00:04:32,239
Nothing will stop Alexander then.

79
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,149
Rumor has it he's already sold
the country to corporations.

80
00:04:35,618 --> 00:04:37,902
Yeah, for that giant oil
field they discovered, right?

81
00:04:38,269 --> 00:04:41,530
From diamond smuggler to OPEC member.
That's a nice bounce.

82
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:45,952
In four days, our president will visit
his brother here in Boston.

83
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:49,163
That will solidify Alexander
as his heir apparent back home.

84
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,501
Jane, don't you think that
when that article you wrote comes out,

85
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,959
- that the justice department...
- Will do nothing!

86
00:04:55,084 --> 00:04:57,729
I brought them proof of
Moto's crimes months ago.

87
00:04:57,854 --> 00:05:00,799
They started an investigation,
then stopped. Why?

88
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:03,064
I don't know.

89
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,930
But I know how to find out.

90
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:20,945
Thank you for seeing me
on short notice.

91
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,148
You are helping me
to catch Damien Moreau.

92
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:24,823
It's just good manners.

93
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,888
Did I drag you away
from a party or something?

94
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:29,214
A date with a fugitive...

95
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:30,663
who is no longer a fugitive.

96
00:05:34,316 --> 00:05:36,591
Mr. Ford,
I don't have time for this.

97
00:05:37,116 --> 00:05:39,649
- You come here about Alexander Moto.
- Yes, yes.

98
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:43,778
Diamond smuggler, aspiring kleptocrat
seemed like your kind of guy.

99
00:05:43,903 --> 00:05:46,387
You wanted to know
why the US leaves him alone?

100
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:48,555
- That's right.
- Here it is.

101
00:05:49,023 --> 00:05:51,924
- He identifies jihadists in Africa.
- You mean terrorists.

102
00:05:52,717 --> 00:05:54,470
- He's a paid informant.
- Yes.

103
00:05:54,595 --> 00:05:58,184
Once a month, he gives CIA a name,
and they give him back money.

104
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:00,245
It's...

105
00:06:00,876 --> 00:06:02,026
<i>Come si dice?</i>

106
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:04,239
A side job?

107
00:06:06,288 --> 00:06:07,705
Have you had dinner?

108
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,285
'Cause I don't like eating alone.

109
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:24,550
Yeah, I got plans.

110
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,763
- It will be for the next time.
- Yeah, 'cause...

111
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:36,900
Wait a minute. This guy makes money
off the backs of children,

112
00:06:37,025 --> 00:06:40,107
and nobody goes after him because
he feeds the CIA a bunch of names?

113
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:42,443
And what are the odds
that these co-called "Jihadists"

114
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,132
aren't terrorists at all?

115
00:06:44,257 --> 00:06:46,947
They're more likely to be
Moto's political rivals back home.

116
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:48,737
I'll take that bet.

117
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,664
And if the government won't
go after Moto, we will.

118
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:54,442
Now, he bought his real estate
at the top of the market.

119
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:57,666
So he's leveraged up to his eyeballs.
And the only thing keeping him afloat

120
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,009
from not going bankrupt
is the steady flow of diamonds.

121
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:02,142
What's the best thing
about smuggled diamonds?

122
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:04,655
I know this one.
It's the way that they shimmer

123
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,925
on the deck of a billionaire's yacht
in the moonlight.

124
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,098
- Because they're uninsured.
- Right.

125
00:07:13,898 --> 00:07:16,370
So, we go after Moto's diamonds,

126
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:19,358
And we end a political
career before it starts.

127
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,524
We just have to find
out where the vault is.

128
00:07:24,942 --> 00:07:26,487
We are at stop four

129
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:30,115
on our tour of
Alexander Moto's Boston properties.

130
00:07:33,883 --> 00:07:37,298
Records show he just renovated the place
with state-of-the-art security tech,

131
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,276
but he wouldn't put a vault in here.

132
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:40,425
<i>Why is that?</i>

133
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,073
It's Raines concert hall,

134
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:44,338
where the Massachusetts
chamber orchestra plays...

135
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:46,305
They have concerts here?

136
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:49,539
Look at that foundation.
I thought this was a bank.

137
00:07:49,664 --> 00:07:50,552
<i>Like I said,</i>

138
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,346
it's the perfect place for a vault.

139
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,079
Junior high.

140
00:07:56,971 --> 00:07:59,999
And they thought Jackie Thomas'
report card was safe.

141
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,781
Guys, they have a dedicated air line
that goes straight down to the basement.

142
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:11,198
Used for storing
extremely delicate items.

143
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:14,701
- That's where your vault is.
- <i>Hey, guys,</i>

144
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,371
I think I may have found
his fragile item.

145
00:08:17,995 --> 00:08:20,765
Moto just purchased
a Stradivarius violin

146
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,877
for $4.5 million.

147
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:25,504
This all fits.

148
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,803
Moto's made himself
a patron of the arts in Boston

149
00:08:28,928 --> 00:08:31,510
to, you know, up his profile
with the old-money crowd.

150
00:08:32,084 --> 00:08:34,648
- And what's his vulnerability?
- His ties to America.

151
00:08:34,773 --> 00:08:36,951
His father sent him out
of the country at an early age.

152
00:08:37,076 --> 00:08:40,174
He was educated in Europe,
got his MBA at Harvard.

153
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,749
His brother's a national hero.

154
00:08:41,874 --> 00:08:43,939
But Moto doesn't even speak
his native language.

155
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,848
He's gonna have to kiss
a lot of babies...

156
00:08:46,973 --> 00:08:48,957
or stuff a lot of ballot boxes.

157
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,615
So Moto's problem is,

158
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,163
is that he's an outsider
to his own people.

159
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:55,742
<i>What about my problem?</i>

160
00:08:56,115 --> 00:08:58,885
I can't break into a vault
without seeing the inside first.

161
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:02,157
Yeah, okay, so,
you need a tour of the vault,

162
00:09:02,753 --> 00:09:06,438
and Moto, our mark,
needs to look good back home.

163
00:09:08,945 --> 00:09:10,879
Let's go steal the man
on the street.

164
00:09:12,788 --> 00:09:13,788
In Africa.

165
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,436
- Has Moto ever given you an interview?
- <i>Never.</i>

166
00:09:22,738 --> 00:09:24,938
- Does he drink?
- On occasion. Why?

167
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:28,400
No reason. Listen,
stay away from your apartment,

168
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,903
and call me
at the first sign of any trouble.

169
00:09:36,229 --> 00:09:38,266
That's nice. Make him look drunker.

170
00:09:39,221 --> 00:09:40,287
And then richer.

171
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,789
What you want me to do,
give the man a pet tiger?

172
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,666
Can you do that?

173
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,055
The protests were sparked by an
interview with the president's brother

174
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:01,812
in which he referred to
the Wadata national soccer team as...

175
00:10:02,252 --> 00:10:04,311
"little schoolgirls." In any...

176
00:10:06,084 --> 00:10:07,709
That was a close one.

177
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:09,003
In any case,

178
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:12,222
Alexander Moto's status as
his brother's heir apparent

179
00:10:12,347 --> 00:10:14,478
is clearly in jeopardy.

180
00:10:14,942 --> 00:10:17,699
I'm Guy Hamilton,
reporting from Wadata.

181
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:23,116
<i>... referred to the Wadata
national soccer team as...</i>

182
00:10:23,411 --> 00:10:24,739
<i>"Little schoolgirls."</i>

183
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:25,768
<i>In any...</i>

184
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,680
<i>That was close.</i>

185
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:33,184
I never said any of these things!

186
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,426
This is a smear campaign
orchestrated by my enemies!

187
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,930
<i>Enemies you wouldn't have if you were
here solving our country's problems.</i>

188
00:10:40,188 --> 00:10:42,433
It's easy for you
to judge me from your throne

189
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,268
in the presidential palace,
isn't it?

190
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,088
<i>I serve the people of this country.</i>

191
00:10:47,643 --> 00:10:49,872
<i>The fact that you see it as a throne</i>

192
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:52,067
<i>makes me sadder than you can know.</i>

193
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,621
You are...

194
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,627
Do you think your brother could
have something to do with this?

195
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,259
It is that reporter...

196
00:11:02,606 --> 00:11:04,394
Jane Akinyemi.

197
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:06,123
You should have taken care of her!

198
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,446
You're right.

199
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,966
- And it is more difficult now, but...
- What do you want me to do?

200
00:11:12,787 --> 00:11:14,139
Just sit here...

201
00:11:14,264 --> 00:11:16,778
while my entire country
turns against me?

202
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,762
You had a phone call this morning

203
00:11:21,076 --> 00:11:24,311
from a woman who says she can
handle these types of matters.

204
00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:27,519
- Her name is...
- Kristi Connelly from Bulger-Maple.

205
00:11:28,914 --> 00:11:31,901
I appreciate your time,
Ms. Connelly.

206
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:36,069
But I am skeptical that I could
benefit from public relations.

207
00:11:36,832 --> 00:11:39,531
I prefer the term
"Perception management."

208
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,287
Perhaps you'd like to see a reference
from one of my recent clients,

209
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,704
the leaders of Uzbekistan or...

210
00:11:46,024 --> 00:11:47,177
Myanmar.

211
00:11:48,482 --> 00:11:51,043
Those are two of the world's
most notorious dictators.

212
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:54,668
Whom I am rebranding
as effective CEOs,

213
00:11:54,793 --> 00:11:57,549
leading their countries
into the 21st century,

214
00:11:58,295 --> 00:12:01,748
just as I can rebrand you as a force
for good in your own country.

215
00:12:04,177 --> 00:12:05,565
The "Oprah" way.

216
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,971
Open a school. Open a clinic.

217
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:09,811
Get out the checkbook.

218
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:12,689
We're much more
sophisticated than that now.

219
00:12:13,156 --> 00:12:14,941
Have you heard the phrase

220
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,622
"One death is a tragedy,
a thousand deaths is a statistic"?

221
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:21,260
Well, the same holds
true for acts of charity.

222
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:24,995
Build a school, and you just
remind people of your wealth, but...

223
00:12:25,381 --> 00:12:27,037
Help one single child,

224
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:29,249
and you're a hero.

225
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:32,131
It certainly sounds more affordable.

226
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,668
What do you have in mind?

227
00:12:39,197 --> 00:12:41,776
This young man's name is Temi.

228
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:45,932
He's a taxi driver that emigrated
here from wadata with a dream...

229
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:49,111
to attend the world-famous
new England conservatory

230
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,560
to study the violin.

231
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:52,890
You're gonna make
his dream come true.

232
00:12:53,568 --> 00:12:56,108
The poor need schools and clinics,

233
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,235
but what they want...

234
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,317
is heroes.

235
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,019
You're gonna give
them what they want.

236
00:13:06,765 --> 00:13:09,173
You know
I played violin until I was 14?

237
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:10,756
I was pretty good, too.

238
00:13:10,881 --> 00:13:12,707
I never thought
it'd help me in a con.

239
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,843
- Well, why'd you give it up?
- I discovered computers, man.

240
00:13:15,968 --> 00:13:18,672
Turns out you can't see naked
pictures of girls on a violin.

241
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,835
So, we need to get
inside that vault here.

242
00:13:22,717 --> 00:13:26,635
Now, Moto, he keeps his Stradivarius
in a climate-controlled case.

243
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,790
What you need to do is you need to get
him to take you inside there, right?

244
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:31,784
The entire heist depends on it.

245
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,187
So, show me what spy gear you got.

246
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:37,641
Got a button cam, GPS smartphone,

247
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:40,137
and I got a hidden Wi-Fi scanner
that's gonna hack

248
00:13:40,262 --> 00:13:42,245
into the building's
security system automatically.

249
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,791
Now, all that data is gonna wash
up on this big screen right here

250
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,825
so you and Parker can
orchestrate the break-in.

251
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,768
Okay. Good. Sounds good.

252
00:13:52,985 --> 00:13:54,784
Nate, you know...

253
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:57,228
I was serious about what I said...

254
00:13:57,594 --> 00:13:59,666
about put on my own crew some day.

255
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:01,965
So, what's this thing that
you think I'm missing?

256
00:14:02,478 --> 00:14:05,051
What, is it, like thriftiness
or like friendliness

257
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,429
or big-picture thinking or...

258
00:14:08,574 --> 00:14:09,920
Aloofne... what?

259
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,142
Rudeness?

260
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,009
So, Temi...

261
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,480
I have read stories about you.

262
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,854
They say you are a prodigy.

263
00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:22,054
He first picked up...

264
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:24,779
a missionary's violin aged 5,

265
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,615
and just knew how to play.

266
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,548
I am here for my family.
The violin can wait.

267
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,596
Don't make excuses, Temi.

268
00:14:33,526 --> 00:14:35,440
You have been given an opportunity.

269
00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:38,384
I must respectfully disagree, sir.

270
00:14:38,972 --> 00:14:41,134
In my taxi, I've been beaten,

271
00:14:41,328 --> 00:14:42,610
I've been robbed.

272
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:45,091
What opportunity do I have here?

273
00:14:47,834 --> 00:14:48,877
Come.

274
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:52,316
Let me show you what
you can achieve in America.

275
00:14:57,192 --> 00:15:00,273
<i>Good work, guys. He's taking you to
the vault. Let's find those diamonds.</i>

276
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:06,279
Down these stairs, I think you'll
find something very inspiring.

277
00:15:06,764 --> 00:15:08,235
Okay, guys, look inspired.

278
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,639
Electromagnetic lock
with retinal scanner...

279
00:15:10,764 --> 00:15:12,869
Can withstand 2,000
pounds of pressure.

280
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:16,248
You want to know what you
can achieve in America?

281
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,962
<i>Retinal scan completed.</i>

282
00:15:23,896 --> 00:15:25,048
Come.

283
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,893
Antonio Stradivari...

284
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:36,604
made it himself in 1705.

285
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,959
It's magnificent, isn't it?

286
00:15:40,552 --> 00:15:43,659
With all the technology
in the world today, you...

287
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:47,001
you couldn't make a violin

288
00:15:47,126 --> 00:15:49,614
that sounds as good as that one.

289
00:15:50,176 --> 00:15:52,076
No one understands why.

290
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:55,036
Sophie?
I need you to see the lockers.

291
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,958
Security log shows a delivery
from wadata a week ago

292
00:16:00,446 --> 00:16:03,384
that was placed
in locker number allegro.

293
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:04,514
Allegro.

294
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,594
Musical terms. So he's named
his lockers after musical terms.

295
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,051
It sounds like our diamonds.

296
00:16:10,374 --> 00:16:12,804
Sophie, what I need you
to do right now is go stand next

297
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,926
<i>to locker allegro
so Hardison can get us a shot.</i>

298
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,488
I can tell from your reaction

299
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,520
that we are a good match.

300
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,195
I think you'd agree with that,
wouldn't you, Temi?

301
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,482
Temi?

302
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:25,942
Temi!

303
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:32,824
All right. So how do we break in?

304
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:34,929
- We can't.
- What? Excuse me?

305
00:16:35,054 --> 00:16:36,828
Did you see any video
cameras anywhere?

306
00:16:36,953 --> 00:16:38,455
- Want to know why?
- Why?

307
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,041
Because video cameras require
people to watch them,

308
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,705
people who fall asleep.

309
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,871
This vault is a
state-of-the-art glen-reeder.

310
00:16:44,996 --> 00:16:47,867
It works off motion sensors
and is unhackable...

311
00:16:48,162 --> 00:16:49,424
Even for Hardison.

312
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:53,093
Okay, well, I mean, if we can't turn it
off, we got to get them to do it for us.

313
00:16:53,218 --> 00:16:56,601
So check the logs and see if there was
ever a time where they shut it down...

314
00:16:56,726 --> 00:16:57,730
And why.

315
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,820
It looks like they shut it down once

316
00:16:59,945 --> 00:17:01,965
when the orchestra played
the "1812 overture"

317
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,314
because they were afraid
the vibrations would set it off.

318
00:17:04,722 --> 00:17:08,573
Guess that's what happens when
you build a vault under a concert hall.

319
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,106
Sophie, listen up.

320
00:17:14,411 --> 00:17:16,326
I'm gonna change the play.

321
00:17:17,972 --> 00:17:19,994
I've just had a thought.

322
00:17:20,382 --> 00:17:21,931
The story of you helping Temi...

323
00:17:22,056 --> 00:17:23,917
It's gonna raise your
profile in the cities,

324
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,069
but what about the rural areas?

325
00:17:26,194 --> 00:17:28,070
They don't have televisions
or newspapers.

326
00:17:28,195 --> 00:17:29,673
No. Only radios.

327
00:17:30,637 --> 00:17:32,370
Which is why this is perfect.

328
00:17:32,495 --> 00:17:34,424
Your brother's visiting in two days.

329
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:37,275
You're gonna host
a concert in his honor

330
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,599
in your concert hall, and Temi...

331
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,311
Temi will be the star.

332
00:17:49,949 --> 00:17:52,270
Play the violin, play the violin...

333
00:17:52,395 --> 00:17:55,379
What were you doing up there? Napping!
I told you we got lots of work to do.

334
00:17:55,504 --> 00:17:58,702
Don't talk to me right now.
You know what you've done?

335
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,285
You asked me to play the violin
in front of people.

336
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,846
You said you were good.

337
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:05,456
As a child. That was 10 years ago.

338
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,049
Come on, Hardison.
You told me you could do anything.

339
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:09,796
You told me you were super-skull!

340
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,531
"Skrull." Get it right.

341
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,202
Super-skrull...

342
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:16,567
who has the combined powers
of the fantastic four,

343
00:18:16,954 --> 00:18:19,431
one of whom is not Itzhak Perlman.

344
00:18:20,854 --> 00:18:23,768
I just helped Moto pick out
the music for the concert.

345
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,037
Look what it is.

346
00:18:27,469 --> 00:18:30,191
This is perfect.
You know, because it's big,

347
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,987
It's loud and they're gonna have to turn
off the motion sensor for this. Perfect.

348
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,157
Seeing as how I'm the one
who's got to play it.

349
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,157
- What is it?
- It's "Scheherazade" by Korsakov.

350
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,387
It's based on a story
from the "Arabian nights"

351
00:18:42,512 --> 00:18:45,308
about a sultan who marries
a new bride every night

352
00:18:45,433 --> 00:18:47,959
and has her killed by morning
until Scheherazade.

353
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:49,484
Every night,

354
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:52,714
she tells him a story
with such a suspenseful cliffhanger.

355
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,947
That he daren't execute her for fear
that he'll never know the ending.

356
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:59,664
She told her stories
for 1,001 nights,

357
00:18:59,924 --> 00:19:03,834
until the sultan feel deeply
in love with her.

358
00:19:05,496 --> 00:19:06,810
Scheherazade.

359
00:19:07,758 --> 00:19:09,939
She's one of literature's
all-time great grifters.

360
00:19:10,385 --> 00:19:12,936
Let me tell you what I know
about some "Scheherazade."

361
00:19:13,811 --> 00:19:17,405
It ends with one of the most
difficult violin solos. My solo.

362
00:19:17,803 --> 00:19:19,908
That's right.
You'll be the star of the piece.

363
00:19:20,808 --> 00:19:21,743
Excuse me,

364
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,999
while I go to my storage locker
and pull out a very dusty violin.

365
00:19:25,124 --> 00:19:27,339
No, Moto wants you
to play his violin.

366
00:19:27,996 --> 00:19:28,875
The strad?

367
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,878
He said it's the first time
he's met someone worthy.

368
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,785
You made quite an impression.

369
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,762
Lord, tell me this isn't happening.

370
00:19:35,887 --> 00:19:37,759
The conductor needs you there
in two hours.

371
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,731
- Come on, man!
- I told you you shouldn't napping.

372
00:19:40,856 --> 00:19:42,132
You gotta go. Gotta go.

373
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,930
Gotta go.

374
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,941
You know when criminals go to jail,

375
00:19:53,217 --> 00:19:55,561
they inevitably pick up
a few skills,

376
00:19:55,757 --> 00:19:58,822
like a pickpocket might learn...

377
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,129
I don't know, safecracking.

378
00:20:05,698 --> 00:20:07,747
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

379
00:20:08,522 --> 00:20:11,118
You know, I always like
to pick up an extra wrench here

380
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,294
and there for the old toolbox.

381
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:17,549
You said it yourself...
He's the best candidate.

382
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,358
Hello, Simon. How are you?

383
00:20:26,483 --> 00:20:28,227
Good to see you, James. Yes?

384
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,689
You must be Temi!

385
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:35,087
I'm Karl Bartholdt, the conductor.

386
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,279
It is our great honor
to have you join us.

387
00:20:39,995 --> 00:20:43,783
- No, he honor is mine.
- Thank you.

388
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:47,579
Now, let us discuss this
wonderful piece, yes?

389
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:51,316
"Scheherazade" is an argument

390
00:20:51,573 --> 00:20:54,412
between the sultan,
represented by the brass,

391
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:57,338
and Scheherazade,
represented by the strings.

392
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,697
Now, as the sultan
begs his new bride

393
00:20:59,822 --> 00:21:03,062
to please tell him
the end of her story.

394
00:21:03,335 --> 00:21:07,332
The music becomes
more and more furious,

395
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:08,956
until finally, Temi.

396
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:12,230
You play the solo.

397
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,149
All right! Let us rehearse.
Everyone, please.

398
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:18,651
Let us take it from the beginning.

399
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:24,991
- And...
- Wait! Wait.

400
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:28,786
This buzzing.

401
00:21:32,153 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm sorry. Hello? Yes.

402
00:21:34,447 --> 00:21:36,691
No, I'm in a rehearsal, yes.

403
00:21:36,816 --> 00:21:38,504
No, I understand.

404
00:21:39,152 --> 00:21:42,903
I'm sorry but has been an accident
involving my mother

405
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,761
and a moped.

406
00:21:45,175 --> 00:21:46,839
Please, Temi, I have read about you.

407
00:21:46,964 --> 00:21:49,089
I know you can play this
in your sleep, so...

408
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:52,111
- We will see you at the concert, yes?
- Yes.

409
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:53,937
I hope your mother is all right.

410
00:21:54,336 --> 00:21:57,577
No, she's fine.
She's a big woman.

411
00:21:57,975 --> 00:22:00,026
But the moped... I don't know.

412
00:22:00,464 --> 00:22:04,072
- Our best wishes go with you to her.
- Good wishes, yes.

413
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,915
- How's the plan?
- I'll walk you through it.

414
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:17,131
We have three main obstacles,
two doors and a guard.

415
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,463
At the first door, there's
a six-digit keypad.

416
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,280
You got the code yet?
Let's find out. Sophie?

417
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:25,532
Minutes away.

418
00:22:26,218 --> 00:22:27,602
Ms. Connelly, right?

419
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:31,779
- Please, let me help you.
- Thank you.

420
00:22:31,904 --> 00:22:34,148
Yes, I'm helping
to organize the concert,

421
00:22:34,273 --> 00:22:36,617
and I just wanted
to check the acoustics,

422
00:22:36,742 --> 00:22:38,953
because we're broadcasting
it on the radio, and...

423
00:22:39,078 --> 00:22:41,616
I hope you don't mind.
I have to check your bag.

424
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:42,671
No, go ahead.

425
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:44,835
'Cause we're also filming it,
for television.

426
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,562
And that lens is very,
very sensitive. Please.

427
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:49,420
Put it down gently.

428
00:22:50,362 --> 00:22:53,663
- I'm sorry.
- They're very, very fragile.

429
00:22:57,096 --> 00:22:58,376
All right, I'm at the door.

430
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,919
- What are you doing here?
- I got downstairs.

431
00:23:07,607 --> 00:23:10,076
They told me...
I got the work order right here.

432
00:23:10,201 --> 00:23:11,606
Who authorized you?

433
00:23:12,504 --> 00:23:15,250
This area is
for authorized personnel only!

434
00:23:15,848 --> 00:23:17,059
- Leave.
- All right.

435
00:23:17,184 --> 00:23:19,146
- Leave.
- I gotta call my supervisor.

436
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:21,270
You know what? This is typical.

437
00:23:21,395 --> 00:23:23,484
He's probably gonna blame it
on my bad attitude.

438
00:23:36,547 --> 00:23:38,293
All right, it's a six-digit code.

439
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,878
The first two numbers are
6 and 4, in that sequence.

440
00:23:44,176 --> 00:23:46,674
Next four numbers are 2, 3, 8, 9...

441
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:48,589
<i>Not in sequence.</i>

442
00:23:49,832 --> 00:23:52,056
That means I'm gonna have
to punch in all the combinations.

443
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,973
That's gonna take time,
and there's a guard.

444
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,600
Eliot can take care of the guard.

445
00:23:56,095 --> 00:23:58,392
- <i>Right, Eliot?</i>
- Yeah. Sure.

446
00:23:59,683 --> 00:24:02,058
That puts us through the first door,

447
00:24:02,336 --> 00:24:05,360
it's a straight shot down,
which leads us right into the vault.

448
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:07,551
Where we have the retina scanner,

449
00:24:07,676 --> 00:24:10,666
so I would skip the stairs and blow
a hole in the floor right there.

450
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:14,128
We get to the vault through the ceiling,
we get the diamonds,

451
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:16,615
we wait for the concert to end,
and we slip out with the crowd.

452
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,248
What do you mean, "No"?

453
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,089
Our only window
to break into this vault

454
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:23,826
is during the concert when the motion
sensors are turned off. Right?

455
00:24:23,951 --> 00:24:24,670
Right.

456
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:28,341
This is a concert for a foreign dignitary
with a full secret service detail.

457
00:24:28,813 --> 00:24:30,189
We have to take out the guard,

458
00:24:30,314 --> 00:24:32,892
blow a hole in the floor
without anybody hearing anything.

459
00:24:33,017 --> 00:24:36,140
- It can't be done.
- I can't do it, either, man. I'm out.

460
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,851
I'm sorry for the people
of this country. I really am.

461
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,888
But this is the most frightening thing
I've ever had to do.

462
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:43,814
No, I'm sorry, I can't. I'm out.

463
00:24:43,939 --> 00:24:46,172
How much time we need
for the break-in?

464
00:24:46,297 --> 00:24:47,927
Seven minutes... Minimum.

465
00:24:49,934 --> 00:24:52,532
Here's where Eliot
takes care of the guard,

466
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,335
and then here's where we blow
a hole through the floor,

467
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,711
the last seven minutes of the piece,
depending on tempo.

468
00:24:57,836 --> 00:24:59,163
What are you talking about?

469
00:24:59,288 --> 00:25:02,125
Nate, you're trying to time
the heist with the music?

470
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:06,396
It can't be done. Everything would
have to be perfectly in sync.

471
00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:08,524
- We would need our own...
- Conductor!

472
00:25:24,284 --> 00:25:27,079
- Parker, what are you doing here?
- Establishing my cover.

473
00:25:27,204 --> 00:25:30,082
- Doing a walk-through. How's it going?
- How do you think it's going?

474
00:25:30,207 --> 00:25:32,518
In 24 hours, I'm gonna
make a fool of myself.

475
00:25:32,643 --> 00:25:35,270
- It's actually a lot worse than that.
- What do you mean?

476
00:25:35,395 --> 00:25:37,410
The whole heist depends
on you being able to play.

477
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,745
If you can't, theark's
gonna know something's up,

478
00:25:39,961 --> 00:25:42,206
- and then he's gonna kill us all.
- Is this a pep talk?

479
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,508
Then he'll take over the country,
rob his people blind!

480
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:46,845
- Imagine the suffering.
- Come on, with the pressure.

481
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,881
I'm trying to get adrenaline flowing.
That's all you need. It works for me.

482
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:53,886
If I get adrenaline flowing, my hands
are gonna snap this violin in half.

483
00:25:55,273 --> 00:25:56,444
You'll be fine.

484
00:26:30,867 --> 00:26:33,216
Ms. Connelly.
Allow me to introduce my brother,

485
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:36,299
- president Simeon Moto.
- Mr. President,

486
00:26:36,424 --> 00:26:39,764
I think you're gonna be impressed with
what this young man achieves tonight.

487
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:43,059
It will be nice to read something
positive about my country for a change.

488
00:26:43,734 --> 00:26:44,461
Please.

489
00:26:58,435 --> 00:27:00,660
<i>I spotted secret service guys
on the balcony.</i>

490
00:27:10,082 --> 00:27:12,731
- I don't have time.
- <i>Meet me in the prop room now.</i>

491
00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:45,621
Can't I enjoy a concert
without you following me?

492
00:27:45,746 --> 00:27:48,745
I need something from Moto's safe.
And don't play games with me.

493
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,502
I know why you're here.
And I think it's cute.

494
00:27:51,627 --> 00:27:53,379
But this is a matter
of national security.

495
00:27:55,026 --> 00:27:56,788
Find the envelope in Moto's safe,

496
00:27:56,913 --> 00:27:58,550
and leave this behind.

497
00:27:59,869 --> 00:28:01,061
I'm not your mailman.

498
00:28:01,186 --> 00:28:04,834
This envelope is a link in the chain
that leads to Damien Moreau.

499
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,428
You will get it for me,
or your team goes down.

500
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:08,910
That was our deal.

501
00:28:13,562 --> 00:28:14,913
Don't you know?

502
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,986
I don't have any friends.

503
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,183
Parker. Explosives!

504
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,021
Okay, guys...

505
00:28:53,894 --> 00:28:54,982
Buckle up.

506
00:28:55,843 --> 00:28:57,097
<i>You have seven minutes,</i>

507
00:28:57,222 --> 00:28:59,940
<i>but it depends on how fast
the conductor leads the orchestra.</i>

508
00:29:00,065 --> 00:29:01,864
<i>I'll follow his pace and cue you.</i>

509
00:29:03,162 --> 00:29:05,346
- Here we go.
- On my mark. Now!

510
00:30:53,035 --> 00:30:54,185
It's a faster tempo.

511
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,395
I'm moving up the timetable.
You have 4 1/2 minutes.

512
00:31:56,411 --> 00:31:57,373
Now!

513
00:32:22,715 --> 00:32:23,715
Open up.

514
00:34:29,982 --> 00:34:31,387
What are you doing here?

515
00:34:31,512 --> 00:34:33,862
I'll explain later.
Let's just get out of here.

516
00:34:35,171 --> 00:34:37,203
- You got an exit plan?
- Hold it right there.

517
00:34:37,328 --> 00:34:39,868
Working on it.
Sophie, any ideas?

518
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:43,541
Stall.

519
00:34:44,221 --> 00:34:46,750
Guys, Moto
and his brother just left.

520
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,587
And I don't know about y'all, but
it wasn't me, 'cause I just rocked it.

521
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,210
Okay, listen, Hardison,
just stay where you are

522
00:34:53,335 --> 00:34:55,259
- and don't blow your cover.
- <i>Roger that.</i>

523
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:04,197
How's it going?

524
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,687
- What's going on here?
- A burglary.

525
00:35:06,978 --> 00:35:09,475
We turned off the motion sensors
for the concert.

526
00:35:09,918 --> 00:35:11,066
They're very clever.

527
00:35:11,864 --> 00:35:12,985
My men can handle it.

528
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:16,238
Call the police.

529
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:22,995
You see? I told you
it wasn't necessary to follow me.

530
00:35:25,183 --> 00:35:25,956
You did.

531
00:35:26,372 --> 00:35:28,500
This is why you can never have
too much security.

532
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,752
Mr. President, wait.

533
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,226
Can I tell you a story about your...

534
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:36,300
your brother here and how he lured you
here tonight to assassinate you?

535
00:35:37,341 --> 00:35:38,714
The thief speaks!

536
00:35:39,384 --> 00:35:42,508
Who knew we would be entertained
twice tonight?

537
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:44,930
Please, go on.

538
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,454
Think about it.

539
00:35:46,941 --> 00:35:49,655
Last-minute concert
in a hall your brother owns,

540
00:35:50,252 --> 00:35:52,649
Him wailing over your bleeding body

541
00:35:53,322 --> 00:35:55,095
live on the radio,

542
00:35:55,398 --> 00:35:58,849
instantly bonding himself
to the thousands listening back home.

543
00:36:00,276 --> 00:36:02,287
And who would foil this plot?

544
00:36:02,806 --> 00:36:04,236
You and your...

545
00:36:04,571 --> 00:36:05,662
Team of burglars?

546
00:36:06,106 --> 00:36:07,106
Burglars?

547
00:36:07,284 --> 00:36:08,906
No, we're not in it for the money.

548
00:36:09,749 --> 00:36:11,014
We wanted this.

549
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,504
Mr. President,
this envelope contains

550
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,989
the names of terrorists living
in Africa

551
00:36:16,114 --> 00:36:18,281
that your brother supplies us with

552
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,824
at his leisure for a price.

553
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:25,418
This is what happens when you play
with the C.I.A., Mr. Moto.

554
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:27,518
We take what we need.

555
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,202
You can't be serious.

556
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:33,524
I turned a blind eye to these rumors
about you for too long.

557
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,053
This is insane!

558
00:36:35,178 --> 00:36:37,615
Can't you see?
He's telling you a story!

559
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,656
Every detail more outlandish
than the last.

560
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:42,515
If he is lying,

561
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,119
then go ahead.
Open the envelope.

562
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:49,414
Open the envelope.

563
00:36:50,535 --> 00:36:52,405
It is not what he says.

564
00:36:52,751 --> 00:36:55,295
I can't open it.
It doesn't belong to me.

565
00:36:56,138 --> 00:36:58,181
Mr. President, there's something
you should know.

566
00:36:58,306 --> 00:37:02,019
We just found a rifle in the projection
room with a clean print on the scope.

567
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:05,013
That lens is very, very,
very sensitive,

568
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,557
so if you could just...

569
00:37:18,941 --> 00:37:20,617
It was my brother.

570
00:37:21,903 --> 00:37:23,532
He is responsible!

571
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,701
No, It's... she's behind this!

572
00:37:26,262 --> 00:37:27,711
No, she lied to me!

573
00:37:27,836 --> 00:37:30,038
My brother's being duped
by these thieves!

574
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:43,434
How'd you know what was
in the envelope?

575
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:44,742
I didn't.

576
00:37:45,391 --> 00:37:46,930
It made for a good story, right?

577
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,017
- Scheherazade would have been proud.
- Yeah. Thank you.

578
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:57,549
- You didn't open it.
- I don't open other people's mail.

579
00:37:57,928 --> 00:37:59,690
It's a pretty serious crime.

580
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:04,865
- So you owe me now.
- We have a deal, to get Moreau.

581
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,869
That envelope is not a link
in the chain to Moreau, is it?

582
00:38:09,182 --> 00:38:12,047
Otherwise, you would just hand
it over to me right now, wouldn't you?

583
00:38:12,172 --> 00:38:14,452
No, it's a link in the chain to you.

584
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:17,609
That's why you knew it was
in Moto's safe...

585
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,555
And what it looked like.

586
00:38:21,068 --> 00:38:23,766
- You saw him put it there, didn't you?
- Mr. Ford,

587
00:38:24,252 --> 00:38:25,582
in the service of good,

588
00:38:25,707 --> 00:38:28,944
Sometimes we have to deal
with bad people and do bad things.

589
00:38:29,215 --> 00:38:32,223
Really? 'cause I work with a bunch
of bad guys who are more honorable

590
00:38:32,348 --> 00:38:35,596
than you will ever be. If we gonna have
this arrangement, never play me again.

591
00:38:42,091 --> 00:38:45,447
I still can't believe it.
My article is finally published,

592
00:38:45,777 --> 00:38:49,701
and the lead is, "Alexander Moto
is in an American jail."

593
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,320
Yes, well, it turned out that
the secret service id not take kindly

594
00:38:53,445 --> 00:38:56,041
to people trying to assassinate
foreign leaders on their watch.

595
00:38:56,996 --> 00:38:59,711
But, Mr. Ford,
that is just a story, right?

596
00:39:00,386 --> 00:39:02,743
Right, I mean, yeah,
the charges aren't gonna stick.

597
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:05,457
But it was enough to get a warrant
to search his vault,

598
00:39:05,582 --> 00:39:07,575
which turned up a mess
of smuggled diamonds.

599
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,097
And the fact is,
he's never gonna be president now.

600
00:39:13,238 --> 00:39:14,535
We have this for you.

601
00:39:18,927 --> 00:39:19,982
The diamonds...

602
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:22,442
Have nothing to do with that.

603
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,987
No, see, what happened is, we...

604
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:28,250
We ended up with this Stradivarius. We
thought that the money could be used

605
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:30,951
for the good people of Wadata,
Maybe a music foundation for the kids?

606
00:39:33,158 --> 00:39:34,523
You could set that up.

607
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:37,107
It was his idea.

608
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,342
Still, I wish we could do more.

609
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:50,943
What is it your friend said to Moto?

610
00:39:51,262 --> 00:39:53,140
Help a single child, you are a hero?

611
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:57,212
Small acts can have ripple effects.

612
00:40:02,391 --> 00:40:04,466
You had a recording of the solo

613
00:40:04,591 --> 00:40:06,695
in a gizmo.
That made it come out of the violin.

614
00:40:07,085 --> 00:40:10,048
No. No, Parker. You don't just jam

615
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:12,534
a gizmo into a strad, okay?

616
00:40:13,903 --> 00:40:15,254
I let it rip.

617
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,999
Well, I still can't believe
you can play like that.

618
00:40:19,298 --> 00:40:20,984
You? I can't believe it.

619
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:23,081
It's because I hypnotized you.

620
00:40:27,387 --> 00:40:28,300
You serious?

621
00:40:28,814 --> 00:40:30,824
Yeah, I put you
in a deep-trance state

622
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,992
and regressed you back
to when you played violin as a teenager.

623
00:40:34,117 --> 00:40:37,934
I mean, you have played all long, but...
I cleaned out the cob webs.

624
00:40:38,952 --> 00:40:41,839
I just give you the confidence
to be the best version of you

625
00:40:41,964 --> 00:40:43,233
I knew you could be.

626
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:47,719
You are now back to the most
promising young violinist in the city

627
00:40:47,844 --> 00:40:49,384
who hided your abilities.

628
00:40:50,335 --> 00:40:52,260
What was the last piece
you've played?

629
00:40:52,487 --> 00:40:54,076
<i>Scheherazade.</i>

630
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:57,037
What were you doing up there.
Napping? We have a lot of work to do.

631
00:40:57,798 --> 00:41:00,332
- There is anything you want to tell me?
- You said yourself

632
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,111
he's the best candidate.

633
00:41:03,571 --> 00:41:05,128
In Vegas, hypnotists

634
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,172
can pick up a candidate
in the crowd.

635
00:41:08,406 --> 00:41:09,508
So, can I...

636
00:41:14,106 --> 00:41:17,641
Hypnosis is something you do to a mark.
Not your own crew.

637
00:41:19,262 --> 00:41:21,133
It's exactly what you do
to your own crew.

638
00:41:21,514 --> 00:41:25,065
Yeah, you push whatever button
you need to, to get them to do

639
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,536
what's need to be done.
You wanted to know

640
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,309
what other quality

641
00:41:29,665 --> 00:41:31,419
you need it to run your own crew.

642
00:41:31,544 --> 00:41:32,408
That's it.

643
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:33,990
And you don't have it.

644
00:41:49,069 --> 00:41:50,245
Alone again.

645
00:41:50,907 --> 00:41:52,637
If I didn't know you better,

646
00:41:53,675 --> 00:41:55,480
I think you like it like that.
