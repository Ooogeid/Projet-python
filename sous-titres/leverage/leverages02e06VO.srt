00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,500
Dr. Jameson.

6
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,600
Mr. Casten.
You scared me.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,900
Only the i.T. Department
is allowed in the server room.

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,600
Oh, i...didn't want to
bother them.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,300
I was just trying to copy
some old research...documents.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,900
What are you doing here?

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,200
Over the last month, our head
of security, mr. Markland,

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,900
Has been tracking illegal
activity in our databases.

13
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,300
Now, you haven't seen anything
suspicious up here, have you?

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,100
No, that's --
I just lost some documents.

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,400
- Flash drive.
- Mm.

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,200
Dr. Jameson, you're gonna
need to come with --

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,700
Find her.

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,300
Yeah. Come on.

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,300
Going down.

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,300
This is markland.
I need ground-Level security.

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,300
Hello?

22
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,400
Is this leigh jameson?

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,500
Yes, it is.
Who is this?

24
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,200
This is forrent alarm systems.

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,400
Ma'am, your home alarm
has been activated.

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,600
What?!

27
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,800
Which may indicate a break-In
or a home invasion.

28
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,100
Female -- Blond, wearing a white lab coat,
Exiting elevator bank "a."

29
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
Hey, you -- With the blond ponytail.
Stop right there!

30
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,800
You're coming with me!
Come on!

31
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,800
The rich and powerful,
they take what they want.

32
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,100
We steal it back for you.

33
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,700
And sometimes, bad guys
make the best good guys.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,700
We provide...

35
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,000
So, when i got back home yesterday,
My place was trashed.

36
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,500
But the only thing stolen
was my hard drive.

37
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,500
I'm -- I'm gonna stay
with friends for now.

38
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,900
Just...in case.

39
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,900
What is it that you have
on lillian foods?

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,300
About a month ago,

41
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,500
One of our quality-Control inspectors

42
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,700
Found salmonella bacteria
On a shipment of frozen dinners.

43
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,600
- Here you are, ma'am.
- Thank you.

44
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,700
It's been a rough week.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,500
Bartender.
Thanks.

46
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,800
- One more.
- You got it.

47
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,900
Turns out the entire frozen-Food
division was contaminated.

48
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,100
Our V.P., erik casten,

49
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,800
Did a cost-Benefit analysis
of the problem.

50
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,600
The study found
that it would be cheaper

51
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,100
To pay off any lawsuit

52
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,200
Than to pull the bad products
off the shelves.

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,100
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

54
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,600
Oh, do you --
Do you want a --

55
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,000
No, thanks.
Um...

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,200
Mnh-Mnh.

57
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm so nervous.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,700
Casten's report estimated
how many people will die.

59
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,300
He looked at the data and decided
it was an acceptable number of deaths.

60
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,000
"An acceptable number
of deaths" -- Over food?

61
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,400
So supermarkets are selling
lillian products that will kill people.

62
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,200
Dr. Jameson, we won't let
that happen. I promise you.

63
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,000
Okay.
Thank you.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,500
- Sure.
- Thank you.

65
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,700
You've made me feel much better,
mr. Ford.

66
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,600
Oh. Um...you --
Uh, not "mr. Ford."

67
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,900
You -- You --
You should call him nate.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,800
I appreciate it, nate.

69
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, i-It's what we...

70
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,700
This, uh, casten, the V.P.,
uh, he's just a VS.P., right?

71
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,300
What -- What about
the c.E.O.?

72
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,300
I mean...

73
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,100
Uh, mr. Price.

74
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,600
He doesn't know anything about it.

75
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,300
That's why i was trying
to get the report --

76
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,200
To give it to him...
or the fda -- Anyone.

77
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,900
Well, okay,
what i'm gonna do --

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,100
I'm gonna go brief the team
about all of this.

79
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,100
Oh, um, no.
I've -- I've got a better idea.

80
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,200
I think i should go
and -- And --

81
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,500
- Oh, no, no, no. Don't be silly.
- Yeah. No, don't worry about it.

82
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,300
Because i-I think that you
should actually stay here,

83
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,600
Because dr. Jameson, she still
looks a little bit rattled.

84
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
That's a hell of a story.

85
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,600
So...

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,200
Yeah.

87
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,700
I'm gonna go brief the team.
Then i'll give you a call.

88
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,200
Oh. Okay.

89
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,700
How you doing over here?
Okay?

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,800
One more.
Thank you.

91
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,000
You got it.

92
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,900
Her name is katie.
Likes -- Wild horses.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,100
Dislikes --
Vanilla tootaste.

94
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,200
Please stop talking.

95
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,500
- Hey.
- Well, i can certainly check.

96
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,400
How you doing?

97
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Oh, i'm so in.

98
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,100
Hey, uh, eliot, what is that
blocking your button cam?

99
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,700
yeah, it's your ego.

100
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,300
Parker?

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,300
First 10 floors are free-Climbing heaven,
But after that, it's a slip and slide.

102
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,100
You have pretty hair.

103
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,200
You don't.

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,700
I just don't know
what you're doing up here.

105
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,500
You know,
you should be downstairs.

106
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,000
Why would i be downstairs
with her? I-I --

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,500
- Look, she's beautiful...
- we have a meeting, and i --

108
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,000
...she's available, and she's
into you -- I can tell.

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,100
How could you possibly tell?
Look, i appreciate what -- 

110
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,200
- And you've got things in common.
- ??? But i don't ???

111
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,600
You definitely have things
in common with her.

112
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,200
- Like what?
- Well, um, she's a scientist.

113
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,500
And, well, um...

114
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,600
You're --
You're a bit nerdy. Aren't you?

115
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,400
I'm -- I'm a --
I'm a bit nerdy?

116
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,500
And food --
She works with food.

117
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,600
She works with food.

118
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,900
Well, you eat, don't you?

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,100
I don't understand how she
could make this -- Look, i --

120
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,800
- Just -- Just think about it.
- No, i don't --

121
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,400
Just go with it.
Come on.

122
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,700
- Take a leap of faith.
- Nerdy? Seriously?

123
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,800
Trust me. I just wish you had someone
in your life. That's all i'm saying.

124
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,400
Yeah, but, sophie,
she's a client.

125
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,700
- Mm, that's an excuse.
- Oh...

126
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,700
When was the last time you had
a date, huh -- A real date?

127
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,100
- Stop.
- And with whom?

128
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,800
Hardison!

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Mnh-Mnh.
I don't think that counts.

130
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,900
Are you, uh, you running recon
on lillian foods?

131
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,400
Uh, yeah?

132
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,600
Don't you think you should
consult with me first?

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,200
Did you -- Did he ju--

134
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,200
We do this all the time,
nate.

135
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Hey, look, man, where do you
think my intel comes from?

136
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,500
For the last time,
there is no blueprint fairy.

137
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,800
Yeah, well, i want you to
pull them out. Do it now.

138
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,300
Look, we know what we're doing,
man. It's a food company.

139
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,700
No, no, you don't, no.
Not with a place like this.

140
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,000
You don't know
what you're doing.

141
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,500
I can try to transfer you
to the department again.

142
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,100
- Come with us, please.
- Sure.

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,300
Don't you go anywhere.

144
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,600
I'd give it exactly, uh --
Uh, two seconds

145
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,900
Before this becomes
a train wreck.

146
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,000
Hardison,
we got a problem.

147
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,600
What kind of problem?

148
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,300
They're mri'ing my pizza,
and their stance says "ex-Cia."

149
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,000
You can tell somebody work
for the cia just from how they stand?

150
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,600
It's a very distinctive
stance!

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,700
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

152
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,600
You are getting query spiked
all over the grid.

153
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,100
Nsa. Cia. Oss.

154
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,200
I-I don't even know what that --
You know what?

155
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,300
You want to play rough?
We gonna play rough.

156
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,800
Oh, we gonna play.

157
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,600
How...do you like me...

158
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,800
- Now?
- Yeah.

159
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh.

160
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,300
Uh, eliot, you need
to get out of there...

161
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,700
...right now.

162
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,600
Working on it!

163
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,800
Parker, i'm coming out hot.

164
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,800
Okay. All clear out here.
Just me and...

165
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,900
Copy that.
I think i goone out here, too.

166
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Hey, big boy.
What are you -- 240, 250?

167
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,800
I'll call you.

168
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
You know when i said
you had pretty hair?

169
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,900
I was lying.

170
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,400
Yeah, well, so was i
when i said you didn't.

171
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,400
Wait. Damn it!

172
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,200
What?

173
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,300
Haison!

174
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,900
Wait for it.

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,100
See?

176
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,700
See? It wasn't no problem.

177
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,700
I mean, i-I had it
under control.

178
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,200
You like the, uh,
the new clear image on the...

179
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,300
Button cams?
I-I upgraded. Yeah.

180
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,400
So, pizza-Delivery guy
was your big plan?

181
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,900
You know what, man?
It was recon. Okay?

182
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,200
Information gathering has historically
been a very safe and peaceful business.

183
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,900
And -- And it was
a food company!

184
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,300
It wasn't like
they was making weapons.

185
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,500
Listen, i-I've worked insurance
for companies like this.

186
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,900
Anyone gets their hands
on the company's food patents,

187
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,400
It could cost them billions.

188
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,100
And, by the way, they guard that stuff
better than defense contractors.

189
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,900
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah.

190
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,400
Well, that explains all the ex-Spooks
hanging around the lobby, then.

191
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,900
You know what?
You live and you learn.

192
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,500
No, i lived.
All right?

193
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,400
You sat behind a computer
and acted like kool moe dee.

194
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,900
What you call me?
Kool moe dee?

195
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,500
Like you even know anything
about kool moe dee.

196
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,300
I was gathering
very crucial information.

197
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,900
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah.

198
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,100
How about now?

199
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,300
How about you share that crucial
information with the rest of us?

200
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,000
Okay.
You -- You know what?

201
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,100
You ain't said nothing
but a word.

202
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,400
Stop.

203
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,800
Eliot. Guys. Eliot.
What are you doing?

204
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,500
She was poking me.

205
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,600
Don't. Man --

206
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,500
Lillian foods is the third-Largest
food company in the world.

207
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Last year, made $12 billion.

208
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,100
This is the vice psident of the
frozen-Foods division -- Erik casten.

209
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,100
Erik with a "k,"
casten with a "c."

210
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
How is that relevant?

211
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,600
Oh. Eric with a "c" --
Nice and friendly,

212
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,500
Erik with a "k" -- Evil.

213
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,800
I didn't know that.

214
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Everybody knows that.

215
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,500
According to dr. Jameson,

216
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,000
Erik with a "k" is trying to cover up
Salmonella found in the frozen dinners

217
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,400
So his division doesn't have to
pay out for that recall.

218
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,100
That's why i grow
my own food.

219
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,800
How do you find the time?

220
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,000
You make time.

221
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,800
I only sleep
90 minutes a day.

222
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,000
All right, so what we have to do is
we have to get ahold of casten's report

223
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,100
And make it public. It's on the servers.
How do we get into the building?

224
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,100
I'm so far ahead of you, man,
it's scary.

225
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,200
Look, i can't hack their system
from the outside,

226
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,900
So i sent a trojan phone.
It's hacker 101.

227
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,300
What i did was messenger
a smartphone with an extended battery

228
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,500
To an employee
that's on vacation.

229
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,300
Package sits
in the mail room,

230
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,400
It scans for wireless
and bluetooth access points.

231
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,800
Unfortunately, even their internal servers
are locked down like the cia,

232
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,400
So all i was able to get
was employee e-Mails.

233
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,800
Well, anything useful there?

234
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,100
Oh, yeah.
You know what?

235
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,700
Marie from payroll has a crush
on steve from accounts receivable.

236
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,000
Look, that's steve right there
on his vacation in florida from a month ago.

237
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,700
She likes him?
Really?

238
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,700
Oh, yeah. That man is a sexy
man-Beast right there.

239
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,000
Now, shannon and chris
from marketing,

240
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,600
They got a little fight going on
with lauren from ads.

241
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,700
Office politics.

242
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,500
God, it's lucky we don't --
We don't have that.

243
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,700
Everybody up in there is complaining about
this "state of the company" thing tomorrow.

244
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,100
And brian from i.T. --

245
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,800
That's it. That's it right
there. That's our way in.

246
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,300
Brian from i.T.?
No, he is not a team player.

247
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,700
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
That's our -- That's our way in.

248
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,800
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
That's it. That's it.

249
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,600
Yeah, the "state of the company"
meeting. Here we go.

250
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,100
- What is that?
- I don't know what that is.
- Me neither.

251
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,800
It's like state of the union --

252
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,300
- What is that?
- ???

253
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,100
Oh, right, right. No, you guys
never had real jobs. Yeah.

254
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,800
- Never.
- Of course not, man. Come on.

255
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,900
Right.

256
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,800
All right, so when i used to
work for iys,

257
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,600
We would do this
all the time.

258
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,900
The company --
Big companies,

259
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,900
They make their employees sit
for the entire day

260
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,400
And listen to these
boring speeches,

261
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,800
Lame entertainment,
bad food -- It's --

262
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,200
Ugh. I'm so glad i don't live
in the real world.

263
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,300
Yeah, and it's mandatory.

264
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,400
It's the only time that all the employees
Are away from their desk at the same time.

265
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,600
All right, so, we go in as caterers,
We download the report

266
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,600
While everyone's chucking back
the mini quiches -- Easy.

267
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,300
No. No, see,
it's a food company.

268
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,800
All the catering
is in-House.

269
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,100
The only outsiders involved in this whole big
operation are the entertainment.

270
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,500
And who would that be?

271
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,800
Oh, you're gonna love this.

272
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,700
Chronos the magnificent.

273
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,600
More like
chronos the jackass.

274
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,700
Look.

275
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,000
Multiple sexual-Harassment charges.

276
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,000
Look.
Even his assistant hates him.

277
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,200
That's kind of sad.

278
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,400
For my next trick,
i will need a volunteer.

279
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,100
Go ahead.
Put your hand up.

280
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,200
- I don't want to do it.
- Woman.

281
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,600
- I really don't want to go.
Don't make me go.
- Girl!

282
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,800
- Take one for the team.
- Okay! Me! Me!

283
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,100
Me! Me! Pick me!

284
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,300
You.

285
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,300
Come on up here.

286
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,300
The box is an sasj-6412.
This is how it works, all right?

287
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,400
Well...

288
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,300
- What's your name?
- Kara!

289
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,900
Yeah, kara!
Love you! Love you!

290
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,400
Silence!

291
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,200
Love you, too.
Sorry.

292
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,400
Well, kara...

293
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,000
Are you ready to step
into the box...

294
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,700
Of mystery?

295
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,100
Uh.I don't know.

296
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,000
I assure you,
it's perfectly safe.

297
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,700
I love you.

298
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,900
That's my girl.
That's my baby.

299
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,000
Sexy.
She been doing pilates.

300
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,900
Give kara a round
of applause.

301
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,800
Sexy stuff! Go ahead, girl.
Do what you do.

302
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,100
Ow!

303
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,500
- Hey! Ow!!
- Oh!

304
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,900
Let go!

305
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,400
She --
She's perfectly all right.

306
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,800
- Let go! Ow!
- Hey, kara! ???

307
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,400
Damn all that "she's all right."
Baby?

308
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,400
Um, baby?

309
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,200
Baby? Ma'am?
If you don't --

310
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,300
Just kidding.

311
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,100
Ha! Isn't she great?
Isn't -- Come on.

312
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,600
Snoodles.

313
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,700
Oh. Love you.

314
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,700
And thank you and you
and you and you!

315
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,200
Interlocking rings.

316
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,300
Hey, man, you --
You forgot one over here.

317
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,500
Just...

318
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
Thank you!

319
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,100
That's dope, man.
I like that.

320
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,800
Get off my stage!

321
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,800
Oh, look, y'all,
this --

322
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,800
It -- It ain't real.

323
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,200
That ain't even all that, man.
That's --

324
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,700
Get -- Get off --

325
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,800
Oh, my god!
Baby, i'm here!

326
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,700
I'm, like, totally here for you right now!

327
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,500
Somebody get on your cellphone!

328
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,100
-  I love you!
- Get a dentist! You.

329
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,900
I love you!

330
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh, that's great.
Here you go.

331
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,000
He did what?

332
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,900
Yeah it's not as bad
as it sounds,

333
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,500
But, um, chronos is gonna be
held in custody for the next 24 hours.

334
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,400
Our event is in two hours.

335
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,000
We do have a replacement, though,

336
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,100
And he'll be with you any second.

337
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,900
I just need you to put his team
on the security list.

338
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,100
Pick a card.

339
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,700
Harry turner.

340
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,900
"Magician."
I know.

341
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,000
"Illusionist."

342
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,400
Magicians do kids' parties.
I do fortune 500 companies.

343
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,800
Uh, right this way, gang.

344
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
Whoa!

345
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,900
And who are these people?

346
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,900
Oh, this is my team.

347
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,300
I believe you spoke
to my manager.

348
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,100
This is nell carver.
All right?

349
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,300
And my illusions designer,
frank brunner.

350
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,100
And my lovely assistant, clea.

351
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,900
Hey, man.

352
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,500
I hope you have a doctor
in the house,

353
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,300
Because this man right here
is gonna blow your mind.

354
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,600
All right. Come on.
We're on a very tight schedule.

355
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,300
Nothing gets in or out of
this building without getting scanned.

356
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,400
These crates contain
my illusions, my life.

357
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm not gonna reveal my secrets.
Come on.

358
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,200
That's not my problem!
Is it?

359
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,300
Could you please --
Yeah, i'll take care of this, harry.

360
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,600
Mr. Markland, um, i'm sure
we can figure something out.

361
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,000
- It's not gonna be possible --
- Yeah, let's pull up the van, frank,

362
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,200
And let's get out of here.

363
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,600
- Harry...
- yeah, i think so.

364
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,100
This is ridiculous!
What the hell is going on here?

365
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,300
- Mr. Price. Sir...
- this is --

366
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,900
Harry turner,
illusionist extraordinaire.

367
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,600
You are mr. Price,
C.E.O. Of this company?

368
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,800
I am.
What's going on here?

369
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,300
I would like very much, sir,

370
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,200
To give your people
a wonderful show,

371
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,100
But your, uh, your doorman here would like
to look at our boxes of illusions and --

372
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,700
And destroy the illusion.

373
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,900
Markland, just lighten up,
will you?

374
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,600
- Just lighten up, would you?
- It's a magic show,

375
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,400
- for pete's sake.
- For pete's sake.

376
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,400
Okay, we're clear.
Let him out.

377
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,300
It's a good job you're not
claustrophobic, eliot.

378
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,600
- I was when i was a kid.
Take this damn thing.
- Oh, all right.

379
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,300
- Really? How'd you get over it?
- Here, parker.

380
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,300
I locked myself in a woodshed
Behind my house for a couple nights.

381
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,800
After that, i was fine.

382
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,500
That is so funny. I was scared of the dark
and did exactly the same thing.

383
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,800
You ready?

384
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,000
That's not the same thing.

385
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,600
What's wrong with you?

386
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,400
So, you -- You --
You're actually enjoying this.

387
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,500
Oh, you know, being a magician,
It's the next best thing to being a con artist.

388
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,700
You know, it's all about
misdirection and control.

389
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,600
So, uh, no one actually told you
that you can't control life?

390
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,300
You see, this is why
you're not in a relationship.

391
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,600
No, sophie, i'm just very focused on
my work right now, you know?

392
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,800
I was out of control before.

393
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,200
Now i'm in control.
It's a good thing.

394
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,200
So, what you're doing is trading
one addiction for another.

395
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,900
Hey, man, do you know
how to do this magic stuff?

396
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,800
Oh, no, absolutely.
Positively.

397
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,700
Yeah. No, it's all about...
the rabbit.

398
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,800
You know, having --

399
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,300
By the way, where's --

400
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,800
Where did the rabbit,
uh...

401
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,100
Uh, okay. Uh...
well, okay, okay.

402
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,500
Hardison,
let's go over the plan.

403
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,700
Okay, the show opens
with our friend erik casten...

404
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Delivering the
"state of the company" speech.

405
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,200
The speech is scheduled
to last an hour,

406
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,000
Giving myself, eliot,
and parker enough time

407
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,400
To go down to the server room,
hack the servers,

408
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,700
Download the report,
and get back downstairs.

409
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,800
So, massively,
there will be no magic show.

410
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,100
Oh, no, there
might be a magic show.

411
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,600
No, absolutely. We might want
to treat these people

412
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,200
To the illusionist
extraordinaire, right?

413
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,900
Yeah, you, um, you really do
need a girlfriend.

414
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
No, all i need is the...
is the rabbit.

415
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,400
Where's...

416
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,700
- Yeah.
- H-Hardison.
- Hmm?

417
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,300
Have the rabbit?

418
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,900
It's a real magic hat, man.

419
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,500
Where's the rabbit?

420
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,600
- I thought you had it.
- Come on, fan out. N out.
Let's find the rabbit.

421
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Damn it, hardison!

422
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,000
I never had it.

423
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,400
Sophie, you're on.

424
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,000
Molly, i just want to say thanks
for all you do. It means a lot.

425
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,700
- Mr. Price. Nell carver.
- Hi, nell.

426
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,100
Yeah, i-I -- We met earlier,
actually. I work with harry.

427
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,900
- Oh, the -- The magician.
- Yeah, that's right.

428
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So, listen,
um, there's this little thing.

429
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
When harry does these
-- These corporate gigs,

430
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,200
You know, he likes to work
in a few little tidbits

431
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,900
About the employees, you know,
just funny little things. Mm.

432
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,200
I knew you'd want to help.

433
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,100
I wondered if i could just
scribble down a couple of things.

434
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,100
Oh, boy.

435
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,100
- Let's see. Um, well, one is dave bickle.
- Bickle.

436
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,500
Dave bickle loves his coffee.

437
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
- Loves his coffee.
- Takes it very seriously.

438
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,300
Yeah. And, uh, who else we got?

439
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,600
- Oh.
- I --

440
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,100
He...just loves his coffee?

441
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,900
Yeah. Oh, i mean, he pours
down... oh, i see.That's it

442
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,300
I thought you said you had to have a
corporate i.D. Badge to get in the elevator.

443
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,500
We do. We actually need
one from a top executive.

444
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,800
Where are we gonna get that?

445
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,900
Sophie's sending one
to me right now --

446
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,400
By magic.

447
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
And then there's, uh, sam weston,

448
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,100
Except we call him "spam" weston,

449
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,600
Because this guy forwards e-Mail
all over the company.

450
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,000
-Unbelievable.
- "Spam" weston. I get it. That's great.

451
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,500
Now, harry is gonna
work wonders with that.

452
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,200
<i>That's -- That is
fabulous. Thank you so much.</i>

453
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,700
See, sophie's smartphone is picking up
the rfid signal from the big boss's i.D.

454
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,500
All she had to do was
cozy up next to him and...

455
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,100
go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Go.

456
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,900
You picked his pockets without
actually stealing anything? Cool.

457
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,300
It's what i do. A man.
A phone. No limits.

458
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,700
How about "a man. A phone. No action"?

459
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,500
Come on, man, you left that out
there like a hanging curveball.

460
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,300
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

461
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,200
To deliver this year's "state
of the company" address,

462
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,600
I've chosen a rising star.

463
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,600
This is a man whose work
ethic, whose creativity...

464
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,600
...and utter disregard for human life...

465
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,500
...and whose dedication to our mission

466
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,400
Make him uniquely qualified, really,

467
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,000
To talk with us about how far we've come

468
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,600
And also how far we still have to go.

469
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,600
I am honored to introduce
vice president erik casten.

470
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,300
Erik, come on up.

471
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,300
Give him a little moment
before, uh, he sinks himself.

472
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,700
You know, i wrote a
speech about this company,

473
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,600
Which i have been proud to
call my home for five years.

474
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,900
But then i thought,

475
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,400
Doesn't our record-Breaking
third quarter speak for itself?

476
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,600
So, with that -- And
the open bar -- In mind,

477
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,900
I'd just like to say...

478
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,000
thanks, everybody.

479
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And let's give a warm welcome to...

480
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,300
- harry turner, illusionist extraordinaire!

481
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,800
Parker, i need my assistant now!

482
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,000
Yeah. Yeah, speaking of that -- How
come parker gets to be the assistant?

483
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,400
How come nate gets to be the magician?

484
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,200
I do card tricks, too. I do great card tricks.

485
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,800
Yeah, exactly. That's
what i was just saying!

486
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,400
<i>Does anybody want to do my job?
Huh? I get punched and kicked.</i>

487
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,600
I just think that if it was me, we'd
be better off -- - I gotta go. Go!

488
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,800
hello, lillian foods!

489
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,700
It's such an honor to be here with you.

490
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,100
it's, um...

491
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,600
lillian foods. When
i think of lillian foods, i think of...

492
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,600
i think of frozen pizza.

493
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,500
What am i supposed to do with that?

494
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,400
- Hook it to something.
- Ain't nothing to hook it to.

495
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,200
We're gonna do a lot
of magic here today.

496
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,300
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

497
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,900
Ah! My wonderful assistant,

498
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,600
The spectacular, unpredictable clea!

499
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,200
Wow.

500
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,600
Wave. Say hi. Something.

501
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,600
Isn't she magnificent?

502
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,000
Oh, look at that.

503
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,300
I could've just hooked it to the rail.

504
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,500
My bad.

505
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,900
How am i supposed to get down?

506
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,500
Go change!

507
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,300
Really, man... you
didn't see that coming?

508
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,800
Not funny.

509
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,700
Mr. Casten. What
happened to your speech?

510
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,900
While everyone's busy with the show,

511
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,700
I've got some things to
take care of upstairs.

512
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,200
Alone.

513
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,600
All clear.

514
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,400
Well, if you wanted to make coffee
disappear, what would you do? Hmm?

515
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,100
Well, you
know, da--

516
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,200
Bickle.

517
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,500
<i>David bickle knows about
disappearing coffee,</i>

518
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,600
Don't you, dave? Hmm?

519
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,500
Right?

520
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,800
How long is this gonna take?

521
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,300
As long as it has to take.

522
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,900
You know, i was just pulled up to the
ceiling of an elevator by my pants,

523
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,300
So do not take that tone with me.

524
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,500
Go. Go!

525
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,600
It's casten. What the hell's
he doing in the server room?

526
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,500
Let's find out.

527
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,000
What are you doing?

528
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,200
All the employee phones in this building
are hooked up to the internal wi-Fi.

529
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,300
You remember the trojan
phone? It works both ways.

530
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,300
<i>See, i can use the server
to access his phone.</i>

531
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:35,300
And once i'm in, i can see
through his phone's camera.

532
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,200
You can do that?

533
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,200
<i>Oh, you'd be surprised at what i can do.</i>

534
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,800
He's deleting the files.

535
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,300
Guys.

536
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,100
You remember that bright idea we had about accessing
the server room while everyone was at the show?

537
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,000
Parker, where are you?

538
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,900
We're not the only ones.

539
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,200
He's gonna wipe
everything from the system.

540
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,500
People are gonna die.

541
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,100
So, do you like working
at lillian foods? Yes?

542
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,200
stall, nate. Stall. Yes.

543
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,000
Ah, here she is now.

544
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Uhthe lovely clea!

545
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,000
Yes! Clea! Very nice!

546
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,300
Ho! Thank you veryuch, clea.

547
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,700
I'll just put that right here.
I have something for you, clea.

548
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,600
Something you might like very much.

549
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,100
Mm. It's right here --
Somewhere. Ah. Here it is.

550
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,500
It's not working.

551
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,000
Have to have another way
to access the servers, guys.

552
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,000
Already on it.

553
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,100
Leigh, i need secondary
acss to the servers.

554
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,800
Try the junction room. It has
one i.O. Station. And be careful.

555
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,100
- Bartender?
yeah.

556
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,900
- Can i have another?
- Okay.

557
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,300
Can you get to the servers from here?

558
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,600
<i>Oh, yeah. If anything, the computer
systems are more vulnerable up here.</i>

559
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,700
- The only catch is, security is way gnarlier.
- What about casten?

560
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,800
It'll take him some time.

561
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,900
See, he has to find and
delete all the copies.

562
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,500
We just need one.

563
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,200
Uh, guys, i-I can't
bypass the biometrics.

564
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,000
I need a fingerprint.

565
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,000
And it has to be somebody
with pretty highlearance.

566
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,700
Shh.

567
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,700
I'm on it.

568
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,800
...supernatural forces.
But here at lillian foods...

569
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,000
- mr. Price, mr. Price!
- What?

570
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,900
We're ready for you.

571
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,100
It's time for your
bit of the magic show.

572
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,200
- No, i didn't -- - We did
clear it with your assistant.

573
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,000
She said that you wanted to
show a more fun side this year.

574
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,900
So, let's go.

575
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,900
Um...okay.

576
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,500
But -- But is it
gonna take much time?

577
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,800
No, no, no, no. It's
gonna be over in a...

578
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,100
...flash.

579
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,400
thank you!

580
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,200
And now, to help me
with my next illusion,

581
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,500
A man you know all too well,

582
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,500
A man the h.R. Department
likes to call a "hire" power...

583
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,700
mr. William taylor
price, ladies and gentlemen!

584
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,300
Mr. Price, mr. Price, if you could just
come and stand next to me right here.

585
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,800
Right here, sir.

586
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
That's fantastic.

587
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,700
Now, there's something
i'd like you to hold on to.

588
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,500
Okay? Just come stand over here.

589
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,900
That's right. Just keep
that in your hand like this.

590
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,000
- Okay, now, i want you to concentrate.
- Why -- Why am i holding --

591
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,400
No questions.

592
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,100
<i>i mean,
believe in the magic.</i>

593
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,400
<i>Yes, believe in the magic.</i>

594
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,800
Abracadabra.

595
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,900
All right, are you believing?

596
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,900
I...yeah.

597
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,700
Yes, what are you thinking
of? A number between 1 and 7.

598
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,000
That's good. Don't tell me.

599
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,700
Okay, now i want you to hold
out your arm like this. Okay?

600
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,900
And on my count, you're
gonna open your hand.

601
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,100
- Look here.
- What --

602
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,000
Ready and open!

603
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,300
Thank you very much, mr. Price.

604
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,200
It was 6.

605
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,400
It was 6. Sure, it was.

606
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,900
Certainly. It was 6.

607
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,600
Who would like this?

608
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,900
What?

609
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,400
It's not optical.

610
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,500
They're using active capacitance.

611
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,800
See, what happens is, it measures the change
in voltage across the microridges of the --

612
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,200
Can you get in or not?

613
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,700
You...

614
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,900
gummy frogs?

615
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,400
Gummy frogs have the same
resistance as human skin --

616
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,400
What'd i say?

617
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,900
That's a low-Tech hack right there.

618
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,000
It's just a piece
of ca--

619
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,400
There may also be a retinal scanner.

620
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,100
Retinas? How am i gonna get his retinas?

621
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,600
Well, a proper assistant
would know the answer to that.

622
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,200
Okay, hold tight.

623
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,100
And now, uh...

624
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,000
how many of you would like
to see your boss disappear?

625
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,400
Hmm? Show of hands.

626
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,500
Uh, now, if we could bring mr. Price
back up here, that would be great.

627
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,000
Mr. Price. Mr. Price...

628
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,800
mr. Price, how are you doing today, sir?

629
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,400
i --
We did this.

630
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,700
See, you're supposed to do it like this.

631
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,400
<i>Next time, you jump
down the elevator shaft.</i>

632
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,800
Oh, stop it. Everybody
knows you love that.

633
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,000
right this way, mr. Price.

634
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,800
Now say goodbye to mr. Price,
because you may never see him again.

635
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,600
This illusion is very, very difficult,

636
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,600
Especially for someone who
has never performed it before,

637
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,400
Such as myself.

638
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,100
Mr. Price?

639
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,000
y-Yeah?

640
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,600
Okay.

641
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,500
Say goodbye!

642
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,300
Goodbye!Goodbye! Goodbye!Goodbye!

643
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,000
<i>So, that's how they do that trick.</i>

644
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,000
- All right. I'll go check it out.
- Right behind you.

645
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,000
Hello? Hello? Hello?!

646
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,900
- Hello!
- Shh! Shh! Shh!

647
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,200
<i>- No, mr. Price.
- Am i moving?</i>

648
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,300
Don't make a peep.

649
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,200
The audience, they're lapping it up.

650
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,700
- You're doing great!
- Yeah

651
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,300
This is --
This is good.

652
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,400
I...think.

653
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,600
Oh! Terrible, i know.

654
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,000
Now are you ready to
see dear old mr. Price?

655
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,500
Yes?

656
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,700
Clea, we must do this.

657
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,600
One, two, three!

658
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,700
Voil?!

659
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,100
Okay!

660
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,000
Thank you! Thank you!

661
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,300
Thank you very much!

662
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,000
I don't see why i wasn't the assistant.

663
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,000
well, why wasn't i?

664
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,300
"Abracadabra." I could do that.

665
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,500
stop.

666
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,600
It's all yours.

667
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,100
hello?Hello?

668
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,000
Thank you!

669
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,500
I can hear you breathing out there!

670
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,700
Hello?

671
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,400
Please take care of this bird.

672
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,400
<i>You said take care of it!</i>

673
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,500
hello?

674
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,600
Would you move the -- Move
the box. Move -- Move the box.

675
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,500
Oh, thank god.

676
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,600
I was really beginning to think
this whole thing was gonna be

677
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,300
Bickle getting back at me
for all the coffee j-- Hey!

678
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,000
Doing a hell of a job, man.
You're killin' 'em out there!

679
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,200
<i>It's really dark in here.</i>

680
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,200
Bickle? "Spam" weston?

681
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,900
Are you guys in on this together?

682
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,500
Who else is out there? Come on!

683
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,600
Now, uh, ca, if you'll
pull the end of this rope.

684
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,400
And the other one. Blow on this.

685
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,000
<i>Now blow on this.</i>

686
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
There we go.

687
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

688
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,800
we're too
late. They're all gone.

689
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,800
Casten deleted all copies of the report.

690
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,500
Markland, i'm on the way down.

691
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,600
<i>Dr. Jameson can cry all she wants.</i>

692
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,100
She's got nothing on me now.

693
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,900
Markland.

694
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,400
Besides the server room,

695
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,900
Where else cou someone
access protected files?

696
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,300
Uh, the junction room. Why?

697
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,400
We may have a breach.

698
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,800
There it is. We have
movement in the elevator!

699
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,800
Lock it all down.

700
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,900
Done.

701
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,600
Go to the
elevator -- Now!

702
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,000
Uh-Oh.

703
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,600
"Uh-Oh"? What do
you mean, "uh-Oh"?

704
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,900
this isn't funny any
longer! Step out of the elevator.

705
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,700
<i>Oh, that "uh-Oh."</i>

706
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,000
Help!

707
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,500
- Step out of the elevator.
- No.

708
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,700
Hello?!

709
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,900
Heo?!

710
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,200
Stop! Help!

711
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,400
I can hear you.

712
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,000
Just stop it!

713
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,300
Just stop it!

714
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,200
Hey, nate.

715
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,400
You know that trick where you make
the guy disappear from a locked room?

716
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,300
I could really use that right now.

717
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,300
What's wng, clea?

718
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,700
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, the --

719
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,200
Is there a doctor in the house?!

720
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,800
Echo team, report.

721
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,900
team is down. Magician's
assistant took them out.

722
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,400
Repeat that last. Did
you say "magician"?

723
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,100
This is no longer a joke! Come on!

724
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,700
Oh, my goodness, stop!

725
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,200
If you can hear my voice out there,

726
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,300
I'm telling you, you're fired!

727
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,100
Stop it!

728
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,100
hello?

729
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,000
Hello?

730
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,500
Show's over. We're blown.

731
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,400
Hello

732
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,400
Nate, bring down the curtain now.

733
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,200
Hello?

734
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,300
Hello?!

735
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,100
And now -- Now it's time
for our grand finale!

736
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,300
Clea? Grand finale.

737
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,900
<i>Thank god.</i>

738
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,600
<i>This, it turns out,
is not the men's room.</i>

739
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,400
But y'all should really have
signs up and down the hallways,

740
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,200
'Cause i been stuck up in
here for about an hour, man.

741
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,900
Ironic, i know, because
of the whole magic,

742
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,800
But see, i build the magic
trick. My man does them.

743
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,200
The drive.

744
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,300
The -- I'm s-- The,
uh -- I don't drive.

745
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,200
<i>That drive. Oh, okay.
I see what you --</i>

746
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,300
Ah, yes!

747
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,600
Now, i'd like you to
count with us, please.

748
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,300
Are you sure this is gonna work?

749
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,800
50-50 chance.

750
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,600
One...

751
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,400
one!One! One!One!

752
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,500
Where is the rest of your team?

753
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,600
I don't even know what
you're talking about, man.

754
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,900
Two...

755
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,400
two!Two! Two!Two!

756
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,300
Three!

757
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,500
Three!Three! Three!Three!

758
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,900
go through the
wing! Check the exit door!

759
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,300
Magic tricks?

760
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,200
hey,
man, you --

761
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,400
You lookin' at all my stu--
That's all my business.

762
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,100
You know what? You, sir,

763
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:43,000
Should expect a very strongly worded
letter from the magicians local 77.

764
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,900
The labels on frozen dinners
say "heat to 161 degrees."

765
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,700
That kills the bacteria.

766
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,000
It's on the package.

767
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,700
The world is a very dangerous place

768
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,600
For people who can't
follow simple instructions.

769
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,200
I'm sorry.

770
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,600
They're outside in the gray van.

771
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,700
Good man.

772
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,400
Was all that necessary, man?
I got asthmatic tendencies.

773
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,100
I don't see a van.

774
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,600
You have five seconds to tell
me what's really going on here.

775
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,800
Do i? Really? Okay.

776
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,400
You're a little strong-Arm, ain't you?

777
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,800
I blogged your website about that.

778
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,800
- The lillian foods website.
- Did you pocket-Dial me?

779
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,100
What?

780
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,800
Give me that!

781
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
Who the hell is this?

782
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,600
The secret of magic is
misdirection, mr. Casten.

783
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,500
The magician?

784
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,700
What are you doing on my phone?

785
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,800
Misdirection.

786
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,400
So you went after the
incriminating report.

787
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,800
And i deleted it.

788
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,700
Every copy.

789
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,300
Absolutely.

790
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,400
But you know, i don't
think all that security

791
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,700
Is in place just to
protect those reports.

792
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,900
Do you? I mean, uh...

793
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,500
<i>what's really valuable
on those servers? Hmm.</i>

794
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,100
We're too late. They're all gone.

795
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,400
Casten deleted all copies of the report.

796
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
do you have access to
the company's food patents?

797
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,800
Yes.

798
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,400
Yes, i do.

799
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,600
yes, i had my
assistant download them.

800
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,400
Magician, thief, whatever.

801
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,100
We have your man and his hard drive.

802
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,100
You never got the patents
out of the building.

803
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,500
No, no, no.

804
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,700
<i>You got those patents
out of the building.</i>

805
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,900
<i>All we had to do was pick up your phone.</i>

806
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,000
Now, these patents represent
hundreds of millions of dollars

807
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,800
Of your company's present
and future earnings.

808
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,500
They're on your
cellphone --

809
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,100
Downloaded the day you were
alone in the server room.

810
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,200
<i>See, i can use the server
to access his phone.</i>

811
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,900
You can do that?

812
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,400
<i>Oh, you'd be surprised what i can do.</i>

813
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,700
I wodn't want to be caught
in that act. Would you?

814
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,100
Huh, mr. Casten?

815
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,400
What do you want?

816
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,200
Well, first, i'd like
you to let my friend go.

817
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,300
Next, you'll pull the entire
frozen-Foods line from the market.

818
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,200
You have to be kidding me!

819
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,900
Do you understand how much
that'll cost the company?

820
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,800
Yes, well, we're sending a
specialist to help with the recall.

821
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,000
You'll also issue a formal apology.

822
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,200
along with your
letter of resignation.

823
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,100
You know what? They had me in a box!

824
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,000
Get him upstairs! Clear
out his office right now!

825
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,400
Now, why don't we give the
lady a nice round of applause?

826
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,800
And your queen should be...

827
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,400
this right here.

828
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,400
Stole it.

829
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,600
You -- You
can't do that.

830
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,800
I'm finishing off the kung pao.

831
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,900
Okay, yeah, i got three
possible clients to research!

832
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,200
Just want to finish.

833
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,300
I've got an idea. Listen, why
don't you give dr. Jameson a ring?

834
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,300
I'm working. Working over here.

835
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,300
put it in. All right.

836
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,300
I'm not even looking.

837
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,000
What?

838
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,400
He's fine.

839
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,000
We practically had to beg
him to come back, all right?

840
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,500
He's not drinking. He's
at the top of his game.

841
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,600
I got to be honest with you. I can't
even believe we pulled this one off.

842
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,600
Well, that's the
problem. He keeps winning.

843
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:42,300
And every time he wins, he believes a
little bit more that he can control...

844
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,500
life.

845
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,300
It's what gets him through the day.

846
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,100
What happens when he loses?

847
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,000
The first time he lost, it broke him.

848
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
He breaks again,

849
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
<i>I don't think even we
could pick up the pieces.</i>
