1
00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:03,059
I checked

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,295
Airport charters in 15 minutes

3
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,165
I'm sorry, Mr. Ford, sorry

4
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:21,821
I know who you are

5
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:24,451
I've.. Excuse me.
I've read all about you

6
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,226
I know, for example that

7
00:00:27,874 --> 00:00:30,564
When you found that stolen ...
in Florence

8
00:00:30,816 --> 00:00:32,020
You probably saved your insurance company

9
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,640
What.. 40-45 million dollars

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,274
Then there was that identity theft thing..
You see.

11
00:00:36,274 --> 00:00:40,836
Your insurance company. How do you
even know how many millions of dollars..

12
00:00:40,836 --> 00:00:43,581
I.. I just know that
when you needed them..

13
00:00:47,183 --> 00:00:49,039
What happened to your family,
it's a kind of thing..

14
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,335
You know, that's part of the conversation

15
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:52,282
When I punch you in the neck
nine or ten times

16
00:00:52,282 --> 00:00:54,622
And we coming up on that pretty quick

17
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,809
I just want to offer you a job

18
00:00:56,915 --> 00:00:58,015
What do you got?

19
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:01,890
Do you know anything about airplane design?

20
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:04,030
You can give it a shot, you know,
give me a pencil,

21
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,390
and one of that little rulers..

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,518
Somebody stolen my airplane designs.

23
00:01:07,518 --> 00:01:08,383
Aah, I see..

24
00:01:09,075 --> 00:01:10,724
And you'd like me to find them, right?

25
00:01:10,724 --> 00:01:12,414
No. I know where they are.

26
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,474
I want you to steal them back.

27
00:02:08,685 --> 00:02:10,841
Are you sure Pirson stole your designs?

28
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:12,481
My engineer goes missing.

29
00:02:12,785 --> 00:02:14,466
It desappears with all my values.

30
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:16,702
And one week later Pirson starts
an identical project? Come on!

31
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:20,337
I don't know. Stealing them back,
it's like a stupid risk.

32
00:02:20,882 --> 00:02:25,946
Listen to me. At the end of this month
I have a shareholders meeting, it's important.

33
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:29,035
I've spend five years and hundred million dollars.

34
00:02:29,035 --> 00:02:31,215
And I go for that meeting with nothing to show for?

35
00:02:31,215 --> 00:02:32,255
Then I am dead.

36
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,756
Look, I'm serious, look.
Look at the people I've already hired.

37
00:02:38,796 --> 00:02:40,889
Do you recognize any of this names?

38
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:43,939
Year, I've chased all of them one time or anoth..

39
00:02:44,776 --> 00:02:46,337
Parker, you have Parker.

40
00:02:46,337 --> 00:02:47,617
Is he somebody bad?

41
00:02:48,153 --> 00:02:49,788
No, but Parker is insane.

42
00:02:51,025 --> 00:02:52,595
Which is why I need you.

43
00:02:54,213 --> 00:02:55,548
No. I'm not a thief.

44
00:02:57,053 --> 00:03:00,918
Thieves.. I got. But I need this
one honest man to watch them.

45
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,585
Are you in?

46
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:19,390
It's not gonna work,
these people you hired..

47
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,016
They are at the same rep.

48
00:03:21,016 --> 00:03:22,533
They work alone, they always work alone.

49
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:23,998
There's no exceptions.

50
00:03:24,141 --> 00:03:25,218
There's no way they'll work for you.

51
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:28,268
Yes, I know, I know. For $300'000 each they will.

52
00:03:28,471 --> 00:03:31,282
And for you, for running it, it's double that.

53
00:03:31,282 --> 00:03:34,857
And it's off the books.
Look at me, who's desperate here.

54
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:37,901
That's just the salary. There is a bonus.

55
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:40,306
Pirson is insured by IYS, your bosses.

56
00:03:42,384 --> 00:03:44,794
It's a $50 mil. intellectual property.

57
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,030
Mr. Ford, how badly do you want to
screw your insurance company

58
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,705
That let your son die?

59
00:03:55,449 --> 00:03:56,554
OK, clear comms.

60
00:03:59,274 --> 00:04:01,029
No, no-no-no, no! Hell, no!

61
00:04:03,088 --> 00:04:05,258
This equipment is total VH-1, bro.

62
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:06,665
It's busted in 80's.

63
00:04:06,922 --> 00:04:08,382
I got something nicer.

64
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,380
Allright, no surprises now.

65
00:04:10,528 --> 00:04:12,118
I've been doing this since high school, bro.

66
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,758
I'm can't be disciplined.

67
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:16,288
It came straight from the airport and up to that room.

68
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:18,109
So you didn't actually saw any of them.

69
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:20,029
But they credit card numbers checked out.

70
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,014
Brake it down!

71
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:27,377
Does that look like Mick Jagger to you?

72
00:04:27,888 --> 00:04:30,228
This is not the room you looking for.

73
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:34,438
This mike works out of vibrations in your jaw.

74
00:04:37,964 --> 00:04:39,544
You can hear everything.

75
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:42,334
You not as useless as you look.

76
00:04:43,056 --> 00:04:44,981
I don't even know what you do.

77
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:56,819
I'm here to collect the merchandise.

78
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:26,378
Can I have one?

79
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:28,503
You can have the whole box.

80
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:32,314
What're you gonna do if the finds out
you lives with your mom?

81
00:05:32,314 --> 00:05:34,879
Age of the geek, baby.
We run the world.

82
00:05:34,992 --> 00:05:36,987
You keep telling yourself that.

83
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,600
You thought I wouldn't find this?

84
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:51,332
You don't get bunny
until you do what I say.

85
00:05:53,346 --> 00:05:54,561
So be a good girl.

86
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,075
Or, I don't know.
A better thief.

87
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:27,499
Last time i used this rig -
Paris, 2003.

88
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:30,182
Is this thing safe?

89
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,412
Terma de Carvaggio? You stole that?

90
00:06:33,024 --> 00:06:36,369
Yes, it's completely safe, it just
you may experience

91
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,120
nausea, weakness in your right side,
stroke, strokiness..

92
00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:44,109
You - preciselly why I work alone.

93
00:06:44,109 --> 00:06:47,430
Guys, listen up, you're gonna go on my count,
not a second sooner.

94
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,757
Parker, no freelancing.

95
00:06:48,757 --> 00:06:51,102
Hey, relax. We know what we're doing.

96
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:53,897
And on the count of five.. four.. three..

97
00:06:58,931 --> 00:07:00,781
- She's gone.
- Son of a ...

98
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:02,696
Yeeehaaa!

99
00:07:11,119 --> 00:07:13,994
It's twenty pounds of crazy in five pound bag.

100
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,350
Vibration detectors are on.

101
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:26,689
No cutting, Parker, use the binary.

102
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,090
You know, Parker
any time you...

103
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:35,855
Whoa!

104
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:41,804
Boys are on they way.

105
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:44,729
Will you get me security?
Do you see security?

106
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:47,482
They don't see a thing.

107
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:01,234
Door is open.

108
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,414
Allright, guys, it's showtime.

109
00:09:03,587 --> 00:09:04,392
Here we go.

110
00:09:04,686 --> 00:09:05,891
- Here.
- Got it.

111
00:09:12,015 --> 00:09:14,356
OK. You got any chatter on their frequencies?

112
00:09:14,356 --> 00:09:14,986
No. Why?

113
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:20,816
There's eight listed on a duty roster,
and there's only four at the guardpost.

114
00:09:20,816 --> 00:09:23,800
I can't even tell how many guys is in the room,
how can you tell who is who?

115
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,275
Haircuts, Parker, count their haircuts.

116
00:09:26,861 --> 00:09:27,196
???

117
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,030
What?

118
00:09:29,624 --> 00:09:30,259
Nothing.

119
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:32,042
Problem?

120
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:33,856
Aah.. Maybe.

121
00:09:34,885 --> 00:09:35,990
Run the cameras.

122
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:39,461
Send digitals forward. I salute you, sir.

123
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:45,465
Got 'em!

124
00:09:45,956 --> 00:09:48,716
They doing a walkthrough an hour early. Why?

125
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,999
Because it's the playoffs.

126
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:58,171
Yeah. They doing the rounds an hour early
so they can watch the playoffs.

127
00:09:58,554 --> 00:10:01,834
- Allright, where are they?
- They at the stairwell!

128
00:10:03,072 --> 00:10:03,347
OK

129
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,574
Hey! We've got a security breach!
Get 'em on the radio up there. Go, go!

130
00:10:14,574 --> 00:10:18,199
OK, guys. Here's what we got to do.
We got to squelch 'em.

131
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:30,637
Elliot? What I want you to do
is clear the zone and use Hardison as bait.

132
00:10:33,628 --> 00:10:35,498
Bait? Hold up, wait a minute!

133
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:39,841
What're you talking about, man,
I ain't nobody's bait.

134
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,635
Hardison, they're on stair.

135
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:56,420
Come on, baby, come on, just come on, man!

136
00:10:58,953 --> 00:10:59,703
Forget it!

137
00:11:02,202 --> 00:11:03,542
Hold it right there!

138
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:35,091
That's what I do.

139
00:11:57,595 --> 00:11:59,678
Guys, guys, you got to talk to me, OK?

140
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:01,963
'Cause I don't know what's going on!

141
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,115
It's all good, I'm stripping the drives right now.

142
00:12:17,813 --> 00:12:18,798
Come on, baby.

143
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,920
Got all the designs, got all the backup.

144
00:12:27,642 --> 00:12:28,687
Drop the spike.

145
00:12:33,232 --> 00:12:34,500
Did you give'em a virus?

146
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,840
Dude, I gave 'em more than one virus.

147
00:12:37,772 --> 00:12:38,407
Problem.

148
00:12:38,989 --> 00:12:44,049
That guards again. They resetted all the alarms on the roof and the floor above us.

149
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,060
We can't go up.

150
00:12:46,996 --> 00:12:48,333
Every man for himself, dude.

151
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,838
Go ahead, but I'm the one with the merchandise.

152
00:12:49,838 --> 00:12:51,825
Yeah, and I'm the one with the exit!

153
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:53,264
And I'm the one with a plan.

154
00:12:53,264 --> 00:12:55,422
Now I know you children don't play with others,

155
00:12:55,422 --> 00:12:58,817
but I need you to hold it together for exactly seven more minutes.

156
00:12:58,817 --> 00:13:01,337
Now, get to the elevator and hit "down".

157
00:13:02,024 --> 00:13:04,014
We're going to the burned scam.

158
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:13,858
Going to plan B?

159
00:13:14,232 --> 00:13:16,167
Technically, that'd be plan G.

160
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:27,501
How many plans do we have, is there like a plan M?

161
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,610
Yeah. Hardison dies in plan M.

162
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:31,288
I like plan M.

163
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:41,452
I thought we locked down those elevators.

164
00:13:55,737 --> 00:13:57,907
Hey, hey, stand still, don't move.

165
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,663
- Nice! Would you stare a little more?
- Sorry.

166
00:14:10,663 --> 00:14:12,011
You gotta be kidding me!

167
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:13,171
No, Tom, it's OK.

168
00:14:13,182 --> 00:14:14,107
No, it's not.

169
00:14:15,403 --> 00:14:17,028
- Sorry.
- I understand.

170
00:14:41,905 --> 00:14:43,784
Come on, come on, it's gonna take all night..

171
00:14:43,784 --> 00:14:47,489
I got a couple of wi-fi networks with some crappy bandwidth.

172
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,048
OK, there you go.

173
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,705
The designs are sent.

174
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:54,289
Allright, the money will be on all your accounts later today.

175
00:14:54,289 --> 00:14:56,423
Anybody else noticed how we rocked last night?

176
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:58,768
Yeah, well, one show only, no anchors

177
00:14:58,852 --> 00:15:00,684
I've already forgot your names.

178
00:15:00,684 --> 00:15:03,259
It was kinda cool being on the same side.

179
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:06,598
No, we a not on the same side, I'm not a thief

180
00:15:06,598 --> 00:15:07,463
You are now.

181
00:15:08,403 --> 00:15:10,393
Come on, Nathan, tell the truth

182
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:13,930
You have a little bit of fun doing a bit of black king, instead of white knight

183
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:14,915
Just this once

184
00:15:38,911 --> 00:15:39,366
Yeah?

185
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:41,074
You screwed me!

186
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:43,535
The designs never got to me.

187
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,450
No, I watched them go out.

188
00:15:46,502 --> 00:15:49,334
I don't know what you saw,
but I received nothing!

189
00:15:49,334 --> 00:15:51,698
Look, I told you you couldn't trust 'em.

190
00:15:51,698 --> 00:15:54,924
It's not my job to trust anybody
that's you were here for.

191
00:15:54,924 --> 00:15:58,052
I'm freezing the payments.
I'm freezing all the payments!

192
00:15:58,052 --> 00:15:59,941
All right, look, look, look, uh ...

193
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:01,822
I'll come over there right now...

194
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:02,944
- No, no, no, no!

195
00:16:02,944 --> 00:16:04,772
Do not come here. My company...

196
00:16:04,772 --> 00:16:06,859
Has an old facility outside the city ...

197
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:10,259
I'll text you the address and you be there in one hour!

198
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:31,261
You wanna say what happened to the designs?

199
00:16:31,261 --> 00:16:33,901
What makes you think I know what happened?

200
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,375
Stupid.
Yeah, forget it, you did it.

201
00:16:37,023 --> 00:16:38,501
When we were coming down in an elevator.

202
00:16:38,501 --> 00:16:41,001
Yeah, that makes sense, doesn't it.
Were the files ever sacked?

203
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,599
Hey, wait, Cujo, I did my part.

204
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:45,092
- I transferred the files. What did you do?
- What if I take the gun and...

205
00:16:45,092 --> 00:16:45,487
Hey!

206
00:16:48,931 --> 00:16:49,911
Did you do it?

207
00:16:49,954 --> 00:16:51,660
You are the one who has played on both sides.

208
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,770
Yeah, you seem pretty relaxed with a guy with a gun pointed at you.

209
00:16:55,809 --> 00:16:58,048
- Its safety is on.
- Like I'm a fall for that.

210
00:16:58,048 --> 00:17:01,388
No, actually he's right, safety is on.
Are you armed?

211
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:07,118
I don't like guns.

212
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:13,139
My money isn't on my account.

213
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:14,960
That makes me cry inside.

214
00:17:15,586 --> 00:17:17,281
In my special angry voice.

215
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:20,434
OK, Parker ...

216
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,018
Now had you came here to get paid?

217
00:17:24,018 --> 00:17:26,139
Hell, no. Transferring funds, man.

218
00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:27,189
Global economy.

219
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,505
It supposed to be a walkaway, I'm never supposed to see you again

220
00:17:31,537 --> 00:17:33,582
The only reason we guys are here

221
00:17:34,627 --> 00:17:36,732
it is because we didn't get paid.

222
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:40,482
And you are pissed off!

223
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,861
As a matter of fact, the only way to get us all

224
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,978
in the same place at the same time ...

225
00:17:51,978 --> 00:17:54,258
is to tell us that we're not getting

226
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:56,907
paid.

227
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:13,944
Come on, get up, get up!

228
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:15,581
Go, Hardison, go! Go!

229
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,980
You don't like hospitals.

230
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:38,517
Not much.

231
00:18:42,962 --> 00:18:44,067
It's about time!

232
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:45,820
What the...

233
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,695
Cops and firemen got there just as they were waiting it.

234
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:50,948
Where are we?

235
00:18:50,977 --> 00:18:52,375
At the county hospital

236
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,960
Local cops are responded to the explosion

237
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,571
We've been processed?

238
00:19:02,021 --> 00:19:04,034
They faxed our prints to the state police.

239
00:19:04,034 --> 00:19:06,080
If the states run us, man, we're screwed.

240
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,595
- How long?
- 30, 35 minutes, depending on the software.

241
00:19:09,675 --> 00:19:11,605
They printed us 20 minutes ago

242
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:14,881
Unless we get out of here in next 10 minutes ...

243
00:19:14,881 --> 00:19:17,976
- We all go to jail.
- Hey, yeah, yeah, allright.

244
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,330
I can take this cops.

245
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,052
Don't you dare! You kill anyone, you screwed my getaway.

246
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:25,989
Hello, I'm still handcuffed here, I can't even go to the bathroom,

247
00:19:25,989 --> 00:19:27,550
and I got to go.
- Parker!

248
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,590
Get me a phone!

249
00:19:30,268 --> 00:19:32,852
What we're going to do is we get out of here together.

250
00:19:32,852 --> 00:19:34,429
This was a one-time deal.

251
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:35,565
OK, guys, here is your problem:

252
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:38,674
You all know what you can do, and I know what all you can do

253
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:41,539
So it gives me the edge, it gives me the plan.

254
00:19:42,198 --> 00:19:43,833
I don't trust these guys.

255
00:19:46,517 --> 00:19:47,617
Do you trust me?

256
00:19:51,642 --> 00:19:52,392
Of course.

257
00:19:53,427 --> 00:19:54,887
You're the honest man.

258
00:19:57,837 --> 00:19:58,827
Parker, phone.

259
00:19:59,543 --> 00:20:00,823
This is kinda suck.

260
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:03,368
Oh, hell!

261
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:14,697
The nausea could men a concussion.

262
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,325
If you feel any more effects, or blurred vision

263
00:20:22,403 --> 00:20:24,338
tell the policeman right away.

264
00:20:41,193 --> 00:20:41,588
Hey.

265
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:43,932
Nate!

266
00:20:47,116 --> 00:20:47,801
I got it.

267
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,350
So the trick is to give them what they want.

268
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,635
They expecting a phone call,  right?

269
00:20:55,637 --> 00:20:58,097
Here's an outside call for you, line 2.

270
00:21:00,403 --> 00:21:00,738
OK.

271
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,627
This is deputy Brians.

272
00:21:07,627 --> 00:21:10,725
Yeah, this is Detective Lt. Carlton, we dealing with a state police.

273
00:21:10,725 --> 00:21:12,696
We got those prints that you've send to us.

274
00:21:12,696 --> 00:21:16,101
The problem I have that there's all kinds of red flags,

275
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:19,076
I have somebody on the phone for you, from the FBI

276
00:21:19,076 --> 00:21:22,011
down there in Washington. Can you hold on, son?

277
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:22,739
Yes, sir.

278
00:21:25,507 --> 00:21:26,492
There it goes.

279
00:21:32,151 --> 00:21:35,806
Yeah, deputy Brians, this is deputy director McCumber, FBI.

280
00:21:35,976 --> 00:21:37,611
Yes, is our man allright?

281
00:21:37,641 --> 00:21:39,854
- I'm sorry, I don't follow...
- Deputy, listen to me.

282
00:21:39,854 --> 00:21:42,251
The man you have inside there, he is ours actually.

283
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:44,582
He has been in deep cover for 3 years.

284
00:21:44,582 --> 00:21:45,337
Seriously?

285
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:48,676
That's correct. You should be receiving a fax any moment now

286
00:21:48,676 --> 00:21:50,731
confirming what I'm telling you.

287
00:21:51,406 --> 00:21:55,168
Most of what I've told you is classified, I need to know that I can trust you.

288
00:21:55,168 --> 00:21:55,678
Can I?

289
00:21:56,727 --> 00:21:57,417
Yes, sir.

290
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:05,987
Walk it off, walk.

291
00:22:05,987 --> 00:22:06,797
Get inside.

292
00:22:18,095 --> 00:22:20,200
Fills my heart with tears of joy,

293
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:21,698
what you guys do.

294
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:24,223
It does.

295
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:28,472
There's a call for you, state police.

296
00:22:33,902 --> 00:22:37,197
4 first-class tickets to anywhere but here coming up.

297
00:22:37,805 --> 00:22:39,145
Who's place is this?

298
00:22:39,848 --> 00:22:40,598
It's mine.

299
00:22:44,168 --> 00:22:47,916
I'm going to beat Dubenich so bad, even from one look at him you're going to bleed.

300
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,363
You won't get within a 100 yards.

301
00:22:49,363 --> 00:22:51,697
He knows your face, he knows all our faces.

302
00:22:51,697 --> 00:22:53,032
He tried to kill us.

303
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,485
And more important, he didn't pay us.

304
00:22:55,684 --> 00:22:57,439
How is that more important?

305
00:22:57,954 --> 00:22:59,354
I take it personally.

306
00:23:00,217 --> 00:23:02,034
There is something wrong with you ...

307
00:23:02,034 --> 00:23:03,669
Hey, hey, heads up, look.

308
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:06,201
Dubenich history is 90% truth.

309
00:23:06,582 --> 00:23:09,513
He is in Bering Aerospace, big rival of Pirson's.

310
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:12,918
But check out what my little web crawler has caught up.

311
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,720
We've lost research ...

312
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:17,579
that we've been working on for 5 years.

313
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:20,276
Our servers have been sabotaged.

314
00:23:20,283 --> 00:23:24,177
Now we are going to pursue these perpetraitors with a full extent of the law,

315
00:23:24,177 --> 00:23:27,347
and with all the resources we have at our disposal.

316
00:23:27,668 --> 00:23:29,114
Could be a cover story.

317
00:23:29,114 --> 00:23:32,400
Here's a logs from last night, it has a time stamps of the projects from

318
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,565
2003, 2004, and way, way down ago.

319
00:23:35,552 --> 00:23:38,680
- There's no reason to fake those, man.
- So we didn't steal those plans back?

320
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,115
No, we were just stealing them.

321
00:23:40,115 --> 00:23:42,220
And why would Dubenich lie to us?

322
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,910
Because you are thieves.

323
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,610
If he hired to you for a straight up crime,

324
00:23:48,017 --> 00:23:50,559
You'll know he's bad guy like you, you'd be suspicious.

325
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,829
This way you saw just another citizen, in over his head

326
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:55,239
and that's why you didn't see the double cross coming.

327
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:57,911
- Why didn't you see it coming?
- Because I am not a thief.

328
00:23:57,911 --> 00:24:01,299
-  You know? Maybe that was the problem.
- Hey, hey, hey.

329
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:02,874
Our 4 tickets to London,

330
00:24:02,885 --> 00:24:04,520
Rome, Paris and Sao Paulo

331
00:24:05,496 --> 00:24:07,333
all matching the ID's that you gave me.

332
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,203
You running?

333
00:24:08,427 --> 00:24:10,982
- Yes. You  got a better idea?
- No, no.

334
00:24:12,682 --> 00:24:13,732
You're running.

335
00:24:14,976 --> 00:24:16,671
That was a high-risk play.

336
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:21,814
You got your balls tied to the stock price like a senior block

337
00:24:21,814 --> 00:24:24,109
with shareholders meeting coming up.

338
00:24:24,452 --> 00:24:27,323
We can't let this guy have any time to cool down.

339
00:24:27,323 --> 00:24:29,478
You want to run a game on this guy

340
00:24:29,822 --> 00:24:30,217
You?

341
00:24:32,131 --> 00:24:34,651
Yeah, I mean, how do you think I got most of my stolen merchandise back?

342
00:24:34,651 --> 00:24:38,235
This guy is greedy, he thinks he's smart, is the best kind of mark.

343
00:24:38,235 --> 00:24:39,980
He thinks he got rid of us.

344
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,679
An element of surprise.

345
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,024
What's in it for me?

346
00:24:43,721 --> 00:24:44,356
Payback.

347
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:47,118
And if it goes right, a lot of money.

348
00:24:47,155 --> 00:24:48,642
And what's in it for me?

349
00:24:48,642 --> 00:24:49,682
A lot of money.

350
00:24:50,496 --> 00:24:52,011
And if it goes right...

351
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,265
payback.

352
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:56,423
Hardison?

353
00:24:56,789 --> 00:25:00,197
I was going to send thousands of porn magazines to his office, but ...

354
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:02,422
Hell, yeah, man, let's kick him up!

355
00:25:02,749 --> 00:25:04,144
What's in it for you?

356
00:25:09,514 --> 00:25:10,554
He used my son.

357
00:25:18,374 --> 00:25:20,309
Allright, let's go get Sophie.

358
00:25:26,537 --> 00:25:28,347
Who the hell is this Sophie?

359
00:25:29,393 --> 00:25:30,498
Hail you spirits

360
00:25:31,128 --> 00:25:33,003
that tend on mortal thoughts!

361
00:25:34,213 --> 00:25:35,138
Unsex me here

362
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:39,044
and fill me from the crown to the toes.

363
00:25:41,785 --> 00:25:42,825
at the foot ...

364
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:44,269
Full of darkness ...

365
00:25:45,222 --> 00:25:46,147
Make my blood

366
00:25:49,076 --> 00:25:50,826
stop all the all access ...

367
00:25:51,735 --> 00:25:53,255
and passage to remorse,

368
00:25:54,408 --> 00:25:55,158
that no...

369
00:25:58,636 --> 00:26:00,786
- That no ...
- She's very awful.

370
00:26:02,397 --> 00:26:03,442
Is she injured?

371
00:26:03,925 --> 00:26:04,790
In the head?

372
00:26:04,852 --> 00:26:07,424
Seriously, man, this is the worst actress I've ever seen.

373
00:26:07,424 --> 00:26:08,879
This is not her stage.

374
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:16,077
No.

375
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,763
No! I vote no!

376
00:26:18,267 --> 00:26:19,317
Parker's right.

377
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:21,278
Dubenich knows us.

378
00:26:22,272 --> 00:26:23,787
And we need fresh face.

379
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:28,636
I thought you were great.

380
00:26:30,943 --> 00:26:31,808
My only fan.

381
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:42,774
Freeze!

382
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,220
You wanco...

383
00:26:55,818 --> 00:26:57,038
I'm a citizen now.

384
00:26:57,656 --> 00:26:58,231
Honest.

385
00:27:01,641 --> 00:27:02,271
I'm not.

386
00:27:04,642 --> 00:27:05,977
You play on my side?

387
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,756
I always thought you had it in you.

388
00:27:21,354 --> 00:27:22,159
Are you in?

389
00:27:25,135 --> 00:27:26,535
I wouldn't miss this.

390
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:33,766
All right, let's go break the law, just one more time

391
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:51,043
Victor Dubenich, executive vice president in charge of new tecnologies

392
00:27:51,043 --> 00:27:53,338
and development of Bering Aerospace.

393
00:27:53,603 --> 00:27:55,713
Rich daddy, trust fund, Yale MBA,

394
00:27:56,629 --> 00:27:57,849
blah blah blah ...

395
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,572
Victor. Now when was the last time you met a Victor?

396
00:28:01,572 --> 00:28:03,562
Vietnam. Tinh Cao Bang Na Ziai.

397
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,214
Chinese border

398
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:09,192
That's an odd thing for you to know.

399
00:28:09,192 --> 00:28:11,352
That's an odd place for you to be.

400
00:28:11,382 --> 00:28:14,283
Bering is in charge of all that big fat government contracts.

401
00:28:14,283 --> 00:28:17,621
Some Department of Defense things very classified stuff.

402
00:28:17,621 --> 00:28:18,721
Can we use that?

403
00:28:18,909 --> 00:28:19,589
No, I do not think so.

404
00:28:19,589 --> 00:28:22,592
Dubenich is in charge of the commercial airline business.

405
00:28:22,592 --> 00:28:26,515
I know that when you sent Dubenich's designs,
you weren't supposed to make any copies..

406
00:28:26,515 --> 00:28:27,500
No, I promise.

407
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,975
That wouldn't be very well.

408
00:28:30,071 --> 00:28:31,411
Show me your copies.

409
00:28:36,693 --> 00:28:37,619
It's an airplain.

410
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:39,513
This is short range domestic airliner.

411
00:28:39,513 --> 00:28:41,153
Usually, one hour flights

412
00:28:41,476 --> 00:28:43,935
It's a fastest growing segment of the industry

413
00:28:43,935 --> 00:28:45,750
Very fuel efficient, hi tech

414
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,390
Very nice carbon nose

415
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,339
It's got a titanium rap, 3 to 1

416
00:28:51,212 --> 00:28:53,847
You know, you pick up thing here and there

417
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:55,686
You pick up a lot of stuff.

418
00:28:58,123 --> 00:28:59,403
Now check this out.

419
00:28:59,593 --> 00:29:00,595
Dubenich and Pearson,

420
00:29:00,595 --> 00:29:02,335
they were head to head for 5 years,

421
00:29:02,335 --> 00:29:03,922
trying to grab the lead in the industry,

422
00:29:03,922 --> 00:29:06,104
it's profit like an 11 billion dollars.

423
00:29:06,104 --> 00:29:07,807
So, Pirson got there first,

424
00:29:07,807 --> 00:29:09,622
Dubenich sticks at the back.

425
00:29:09,861 --> 00:29:11,196
So they got a rival.

426
00:29:11,557 --> 00:29:13,527
It's kind of rival that hurted him so much

427
00:29:13,527 --> 00:29:16,069
has hired us to steal his designs. This is good.

428
00:29:16,069 --> 00:29:19,589
- What are you thinking, Nate?
- I'm thinking Nigerians.

429
00:29:21,544 --> 00:29:23,539
Yeah, Nigerians will do nicely.

430
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:34,735
Well, he hasn't changed a bit.

431
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,855
Your 9 o'clock is here.

432
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:39,738
But ...

433
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:46,947
Mr. Dubenich.

434
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:49,991
Anna Gunstott,

435
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:53,900
African Commercial Transport and Trade Initiative.

436
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,250
Faking amount is suck.

437
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,504
- You're government?
- No, no.

438
00:30:01,504 --> 00:30:03,329
Private business consultant.

439
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,070
We looking to incourage infrastructure development

440
00:30:08,486 --> 00:30:09,891
and economic renewal.

441
00:30:11,872 --> 00:30:15,375
I don't know what's that means in English.
What does it mean?

442
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:17,540
We create jobs in trade in Africa.

443
00:30:17,844 --> 00:30:20,199
Keeping graft and stealing managable.

444
00:30:21,704 --> 00:30:23,044
But she's not awful.

445
00:30:23,077 --> 00:30:24,297
This is her stage.

446
00:30:24,863 --> 00:30:28,278
Sophie Devereaux is the finest actress you've ever seen

447
00:30:28,956 --> 00:30:30,413
when she's breaking the law.

448
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:32,137
Keeping graft and stealing managable in Africa?

449
00:30:32,137 --> 00:30:33,580
Good luck. I do not think I can help.

450
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:37,306
I don't think that any human being on Earth can help you with that, sorry.

451
00:30:37,306 --> 00:30:37,936
Come on.

452
00:30:39,165 --> 00:30:41,925
Let's go and talk somewhere less formal, eh?

453
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:45,598
No, no, no, I ...

454
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:47,142
Uh, look, uh ...

455
00:30:47,571 --> 00:30:48,436
Miss, uh ...

456
00:30:59,928 --> 00:31:00,678
OK, and...

457
00:31:02,379 --> 00:31:02,774
Now.

458
00:31:13,324 --> 00:31:14,484
What? No, no. No.

459
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:15,929
No, no, no, no.

460
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,738
No. No, no, please.

461
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,000
Hello, IT?

462
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,846
Yeah, this is Victor Dubenich's office,

463
00:31:25,846 --> 00:31:28,141
my computer just completely crashed.

464
00:31:28,413 --> 00:31:30,537
Oh, ma'am, I'm sorry to hear about that.

465
00:31:30,537 --> 00:31:32,621
You tried to turn it on and off again?

466
00:31:32,621 --> 00:31:34,529
- It does not work..
- Thats the computer thing.

467
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:36,044
They ought to say that.

468
00:31:36,324 --> 00:31:37,074
Well done.

469
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,925
We got someone on your floor already

470
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:40,970
Thank you.

471
00:31:50,281 --> 00:31:51,566
Somebody called IT?

472
00:31:52,137 --> 00:31:53,765
I represent a group of investors ...

473
00:31:53,765 --> 00:31:55,815
who looking to start an airline.

474
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,210
for short-range flights in Africa.

475
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,440
From Johannesburg?

476
00:31:59,655 --> 00:32:01,966
Ok, he's testing you, you want Bloemfontein.

477
00:32:01,966 --> 00:32:03,473
Keep away from the hubs,

478
00:32:03,473 --> 00:32:06,598
revitalize the original airports. In South Africa,

479
00:32:07,115 --> 00:32:08,756
Bloemfontein, for example.

480
00:32:08,756 --> 00:32:09,391
Machili,

481
00:32:09,932 --> 00:32:11,687
It's Nigeria we focused on.

482
00:32:12,091 --> 00:32:14,421
- Yeah, perfect.
- Lakes ??? a mess!

483
00:32:15,106 --> 00:32:17,974
I beleive new airplanes will make people so comfortable

484
00:32:17,974 --> 00:32:19,674
while renewing the tracks.

485
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:20,433
Aha.

486
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:23,769
I do not recall having said anything about new planes.

487
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:24,344
Victor.

488
00:32:25,667 --> 00:32:27,742
But you and your chief engineer are planning

489
00:32:27,742 --> 00:32:29,701
speak in their shareholders meetings.

490
00:32:29,701 --> 00:32:31,889
I think you know more about my business than I do.

491
00:32:31,889 --> 00:32:33,349
I've done my homework.

492
00:32:33,971 --> 00:32:35,611
You find you fascinating.

493
00:32:45,304 --> 00:32:47,114
It's good to have a passion.

494
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:49,523
It is. Let me show you how to

495
00:32:49,523 --> 00:32:51,283
reconnect with the network.

496
00:32:51,507 --> 00:32:53,732
Should I be playing a computer guy?

497
00:32:53,777 --> 00:32:56,707
No, I want you to actually be the computer guy.

498
00:33:16,718 --> 00:33:17,938
All right. Uh, no.

499
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:22,074
And... reboot.

500
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:23,994
Voila.

501
00:33:24,784 --> 00:33:26,714
You strong for a computer guy.

502
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:29,357
Thank you.

503
00:33:30,207 --> 00:33:32,657
I like to work out, try to stay big ...

504
00:33:32,684 --> 00:33:34,789
I love dressing up for a Klingon,

505
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:36,911
go to all the conventions, you know..

506
00:33:36,911 --> 00:33:37,486
Baklag!

507
00:33:38,027 --> 00:33:38,542
Sorry.

508
00:33:39,552 --> 00:33:41,587
- Baklag!
- Don't you tease me!

509
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:43,991
Oh, hold up, man, that is not cool.

510
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:48,374
We'll have a strong talk when you'll get back.

511
00:33:52,495 --> 00:33:53,734
But with blue eyes...

512
00:33:53,734 --> 00:33:54,484
Thank you.

513
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,685
... blue ...

514
00:33:58,302 --> 00:33:59,702
Sorry, is it Gunshot?

515
00:34:00,047 --> 00:34:00,562
Sorry.

516
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:02,977
- Gunstott.
- Gunstott!

517
00:34:03,562 --> 00:34:05,362
- Sorry about that.
- Anna.

518
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:06,670
Anna. Thank you.

519
00:34:07,693 --> 00:34:10,089
How is this?
If we announced a new product ...

520
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:13,554
then you can order as many as your little heart desires.

521
00:34:14,475 --> 00:34:16,105
OKl, you know what to do.
Hit him.

522
00:34:16,105 --> 00:34:18,582
We select to build the plains. More jobs.

523
00:34:18,582 --> 00:34:20,397
Built'em in Africa, fly'em in Africa,

524
00:34:20,397 --> 00:34:22,574
and sell the rest around the world.
- Now, that's very ambitious.

525
00:34:22,574 --> 00:34:24,958
You have manufacturing facilities to do all that?

526
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:25,353
Ach!

527
00:34:25,937 --> 00:34:28,657
We can easily rise the money to build the facilities.

528
00:34:28,657 --> 00:34:29,167
If ...

529
00:34:30,795 --> 00:34:33,605
we know for sertain that we will get the contracts.

530
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:34,415
Attah girl.

531
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:35,245
Anna ...

532
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:38,579
I'm really sorry, but I can't help you.

533
00:34:41,926 --> 00:34:43,911
Yeah, that was a nice try, man.

534
00:34:44,497 --> 00:34:45,362
Wait for it.

535
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,905
- And I really..
- I understand.

536
00:34:49,206 --> 00:34:50,215
I really do have...

537
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:51,730
I'll take it to Pirson.

538
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,135
Pirson?

539
00:34:56,032 --> 00:34:57,962
No! Pirson is a great company.

540
00:34:57,974 --> 00:35:00,219
Sure, go ahead, I do not think that can help you, but ...

541
00:35:00,219 --> 00:35:02,598
Well, they have a reputation for long-term investment.

542
00:35:02,598 --> 00:35:04,593
You don't. They are innovators.

543
00:35:04,684 --> 00:35:05,139
Yeah.

544
00:35:06,282 --> 00:35:08,037
It's probably a better fit.

545
00:35:09,748 --> 00:35:10,908
I know, I'm aware

546
00:35:11,557 --> 00:35:13,552
that you manipulating me, Anna.

547
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,239
I should hope so.

548
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:20,547
Hundreds of millions of dollars in new contracts.

549
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:22,413
A lot of good press.

550
00:35:23,042 --> 00:35:24,202
All at your door.

551
00:35:28,496 --> 00:35:30,956
Okay, I give up, I'll take the meeting.

552
00:35:31,398 --> 00:35:33,268
I'll have my office call you.

553
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:35,682
-  What? Yeah.
-Day after tomorrow?

554
00:35:36,122 --> 00:35:37,822
Yeah, sure. Look forward..

555
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:39,962
doing business with you...

556
00:35:47,952 --> 00:35:48,642
Yo, Nate!

557
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,703
I've got all their financial records, all passwords

558
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,880
The five ... No thanks.
The five to the corner.

559
00:36:05,951 --> 00:36:07,056
You look better.

560
00:36:07,862 --> 00:36:09,897
- Then when we started.
- Yeah.

561
00:36:12,746 --> 00:36:14,199
What's that bothers you, huh?

562
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:17,354
- I... Well, this isn't suppose to feel..
-  Good?

563
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:22,716
It's not too hard to figure out.

564
00:36:22,845 --> 00:36:24,250
Dubenich screwed you.

565
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:26,779
He cheated you by stealing from another company

566
00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:29,939
and in your good guy brain sees him as the bad guy.

567
00:36:30,177 --> 00:36:31,465
Your conscience is clear.

568
00:36:31,465 --> 00:36:33,215
You want to take your shot?

569
00:36:37,694 --> 00:36:39,804
Listen, I'm sorry about your kid.

570
00:36:41,976 --> 00:36:44,206
You don't know anything about that.

571
00:36:44,733 --> 00:36:46,018
Everybody knows it.

572
00:36:46,374 --> 00:36:50,129
Guy like you goes of the street, then a lot of people notice.

573
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:52,423
And it was a bad story too.

574
00:36:52,855 --> 00:36:55,302
How they even justified that, the insurance company?

575
00:36:55,302 --> 00:36:57,472
Just not paying for his treatment?

576
00:37:13,783 --> 00:37:15,898
They claimed it was experimental.

577
00:37:20,701 --> 00:37:23,416
You should've kept on of those Monets you found.

578
00:37:23,416 --> 00:37:26,921
- If you'd sold ...
- Elliot, you and I are not friends.

579
00:37:29,198 --> 00:37:29,713
Right.

580
00:37:30,964 --> 00:37:31,479
Right.

581
00:37:33,192 --> 00:37:35,182
Because you have so many of'em.

582
00:37:37,294 --> 00:37:38,104
Ann coming.

583
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:41,156
Hey.

584
00:37:42,265 --> 00:37:44,931
- Help me with this headset.
- Why don't you ask Hardison?

585
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:45,916
Nate, come on.

586
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:00,756
Thanks

587
00:38:02,608 --> 00:38:03,063
So...

588
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:08,312
this time you really are inside my head.

589
00:38:32,621 --> 00:38:34,021
Sophie, he's on site.

590
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:35,304
What?

591
00:38:37,193 --> 00:38:38,353
No, Im not ready!

592
00:38:43,977 --> 00:38:45,235
If you don't meet him right down in the lobby

593
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:47,302
his going to the building directory looking for the office number.

594
00:38:47,302 --> 00:38:49,947
Guys, we're not in the building directory!

595
00:38:52,784 --> 00:38:54,818
And why aren't we in the directory?

596
00:38:54,818 --> 00:38:57,578
I don't know, maybe because of fake offices?

597
00:39:11,472 --> 00:39:13,112
What's with the elevator?

598
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:17,623
Allright, I'll distract him.

599
00:39:17,623 --> 00:39:20,733
Parker, you got 10 seconds to get Sophie to lobby.

600
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:23,065
Sophie!

601
00:39:27,894 --> 00:39:30,044
- What's going on?
- Put this on!

602
00:39:31,592 --> 00:39:32,577
What's it for?

603
00:39:33,192 --> 00:39:33,707
Speed.

604
00:41:02,909 --> 00:41:04,839
Our offices on the 10th floor.

605
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:06,363
Oh, you're...

606
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:08,524
You have a glow.

607
00:41:09,212 --> 00:41:10,377
Just ... excited.

608
00:41:17,722 --> 00:41:18,472
One thing.

609
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,524
The gentlemen bringing this opportunity ...

610
00:41:21,524 --> 00:41:23,980
to work with their government, they're ...

611
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,860
expect some ... compensation.

612
00:41:27,137 --> 00:41:28,652
Not a bribe, of course.

613
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,780
- A finder's fee.
- Exactly.

614
00:41:31,233 --> 00:41:34,101
I thought your job was to eliminate graft and stealing?

615
00:41:34,101 --> 00:41:36,321
No. My job is to keep it managable.

616
00:41:54,939 --> 00:41:56,276
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

617
00:41:56,276 --> 00:41:57,709
- Mr. Dubenich.
- Yes.

618
00:41:57,709 --> 00:42:00,333
- We're honored by your presence.
- No, no, the honor is entirely mine.

619
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:02,977
Getting it at the ground floor, something like this is a ...

620
00:42:02,977 --> 00:42:04,742
wonderful opportunity, sir.

621
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:07,959
Nice job with the zipline.

622
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:10,599
Totally thought she was going to break a leg.

623
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:12,349
Not bad for the first time.

624
00:42:12,468 --> 00:42:13,466
So, what do you think?

625
00:42:13,466 --> 00:42:14,806
She's closing it up.

626
00:42:14,964 --> 00:42:16,074
Yes, absolutely.

627
00:42:16,512 --> 00:42:18,957
We can definitely recompose those factories.

628
00:42:18,957 --> 00:42:19,472
Great.

629
00:42:20,081 --> 00:42:23,520
I beleive we'll be able to do a lot of business together, sir.

630
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,210
About ...

631
00:42:26,121 --> 00:42:27,286
the other matter.

632
00:42:29,827 --> 00:42:30,577
Of course.

633
00:42:58,401 --> 00:42:59,626
Is that agreeable?

634
00:43:00,774 --> 00:43:03,174
Oh, I think we can work something out.

635
00:43:04,397 --> 00:43:05,152
Excellent.

636
00:43:11,556 --> 00:43:12,361
We got him?

637
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:13,544
We own him.

638
00:43:14,007 --> 00:43:16,937
Ok, gang, let's go, we got a busy day tomorrow.

639
00:43:17,221 --> 00:43:20,316
- This is going to work, right?
- I guarantee it.

640
00:43:21,512 --> 00:43:23,525
- This is insane, you're risking everything!
- Adam.

641
00:43:23,525 --> 00:43:26,575
We took a chance ... stealing those plans now ...

642
00:43:35,401 --> 00:43:36,326
What is that?

643
00:43:39,015 --> 00:43:42,752
It is a transmitter, and they've been listening to everything that we've been saying.

644
00:43:42,752 --> 00:43:44,957
- Who 'they'?
-  Who do you think?

645
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,290
Also, I checked, there's no office

646
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,808
fo the African Commercial Trade Initiative anywhere in the city.

647
00:43:52,808 --> 00:43:55,812
They're runnig a scam on me and i know exactly what they're doing.

648
00:43:55,812 --> 00:43:57,037
Tomorrow it stops.

649
00:43:57,397 --> 00:43:59,897
- Get the FBI on the phone.
- Yes, sir.

650
00:44:01,387 --> 00:44:04,210
-  Sure you know what you're doing?
- Yeah, they're pissed, I get that.

651
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,363
They want to make me pay.

652
00:44:05,363 --> 00:44:08,238
I mean, an opportunity like this the same week

653
00:44:08,402 --> 00:44:10,385
with the shareholders meeting, the bug, the fake offices

654
00:44:10,385 --> 00:44:12,855
cash bribes, Nigerians, for god's sake!

655
00:44:13,187 --> 00:44:16,127
Nigerians, I mean, its like, those e-mail scams

656
00:44:16,172 --> 00:44:17,929
with Nigerian bank fraud letters.

657
00:44:17,929 --> 00:44:19,969
Who the hell do they think I am?

658
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:22,636
Some dog they could just lead around.

659
00:44:23,518 --> 00:44:26,573
They're going to find exactly how wrong they are.

660
00:44:36,267 --> 00:44:38,211
Fly anywhere, anywhere in the world.

661
00:44:38,211 --> 00:44:40,081
I want to introduce to you...

662
00:44:56,849 --> 00:45:00,024
It's more than just nuts, bolts, and scrap metal...

663
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:31,931
- What I noticed - it's good for you.
- It's a good day for all of us.

664
00:45:31,931 --> 00:45:33,944
The stoks got 15 points up since the announcement.

665
00:45:33,944 --> 00:45:34,416
Really?

666
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:37,331
- You didn't know ?
- No. I'll pass it around.

667
00:45:38,928 --> 00:45:41,448
Aren't you the cat that take the canary?

668
00:45:41,943 --> 00:45:43,378
- It is a joke?
- ???

669
00:45:44,495 --> 00:45:45,070
Gulity.

670
00:45:48,302 --> 00:45:50,052
Why don't we get this done?

671
00:45:50,172 --> 00:45:51,257
-  Now?
- Yeah.

672
00:45:53,069 --> 00:45:55,843
- You have the whole payment?
- Yeah, absolutely, I think we should make the deal

673
00:45:55,843 --> 00:45:58,073
I'm going to make the announcement, get'em bigger headlines.

674
00:45:58,073 --> 00:46:00,488
I'll take'em into the conference room, away from all this

675
00:46:00,488 --> 00:46:02,063
Come, come, let's do it.

676
00:46:02,416 --> 00:46:04,211
- I'll be right back.
- OK!

677
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:12,535
Gentleman.

678
00:46:12,956 --> 00:46:15,889
Now everybody come in, sit down, relax, make yourselves comfortable.

679
00:46:15,889 --> 00:46:17,274
- Thank you.
- Sure.

680
00:46:23,087 --> 00:46:26,497
I assume we all understand the tirms of this agreement.

681
00:46:27,773 --> 00:46:28,909
Well, I'll tel you.

682
00:46:28,909 --> 00:46:31,194
The exact turms of the agreement ...

683
00:46:32,895 --> 00:46:33,645
are these.

684
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:37,222
FBI, don't move! Are you allright, sir?

685
00:46:37,222 --> 00:46:39,312
- Oh, Im fine.
- Yes, of course.

686
00:46:39,489 --> 00:46:41,223
Thanks for asking, everything's perfect.

687
00:46:41,223 --> 00:46:41,798
What?..

688
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:45,180
What're you?.. Wait a minute, wait a minute!

689
00:46:45,193 --> 00:46:46,113
Let go of me!

690
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:47,893
Please.

691
00:46:49,102 --> 00:46:52,124
Why are you looking at me, for the criminals just sitting right over there, look at them.

692
00:46:52,124 --> 00:46:53,289
Listen, I spoke..

693
00:46:53,699 --> 00:46:55,917
I spoke with special agent Higgins,

694
00:46:55,917 --> 00:46:58,961
- If you'll call him on the phone...
- I'm special agent Higgins.

695
00:46:58,961 --> 00:47:02,316
Victor Dubenich, you're under arrest for soliciting a bribe ...

696
00:47:02,316 --> 00:47:04,629
from these Nigerian government officials.

697
00:47:04,629 --> 00:47:06,836
I do not ... I do not ... This aren't even Nigerians!

698
00:47:06,836 --> 00:47:07,996
Of course we are!

699
00:47:10,717 --> 00:47:11,830
- No, no. No, no, no.

700
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:15,223
- Your woman knew that when she contacted us last week.

701
00:47:15,223 --> 00:47:16,148
My ... woman?

702
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:18,524
Ann ...  Anna?

703
00:47:22,644 --> 00:47:23,099
Anna!

704
00:47:27,127 --> 00:47:28,767
Special Agent Higgins ...

705
00:47:28,861 --> 00:47:30,604
Anna Gunstott works for them.

706
00:47:30,604 --> 00:47:31,419
Ridiculous!

707
00:47:31,956 --> 00:47:34,005
She contacted us on your behalf.

708
00:47:34,005 --> 00:47:36,760
She told us she were directly under you now.

709
00:47:38,301 --> 00:47:40,656
Anna Gunstott, from Bering Aerospace.

710
00:47:41,406 --> 00:47:43,406
Directly under Victor Dubenich.

711
00:47:45,007 --> 00:47:45,577
But ...

712
00:47:47,368 --> 00:47:48,408
She took me ...

713
00:47:49,152 --> 00:47:50,691
She took me to their office!

714
00:47:50,691 --> 00:47:53,321
No, we do not have an office in this city.

715
00:47:54,134 --> 00:47:54,769
Exactly.

716
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,834
We met her at your other office.

717
00:48:11,443 --> 00:48:13,798
Anna Gunstott, from Bering Aerospace.

718
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:20,768
Shareholders.

719
00:48:22,454 --> 00:48:23,624
The shareholders!

720
00:48:32,235 --> 00:48:33,340
In god's name...

721
00:48:45,749 --> 00:48:47,919
It's a private party, you can't...

722
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,485
No, no, no.

723
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:53,708
Everybody, can I have your attention?

724
00:48:53,937 --> 00:48:55,217
It's a ??? problem!

725
00:48:55,765 --> 00:48:57,249
- They have sent the wrong people..
- Victor, what's going on?!

726
00:48:57,249 --> 00:48:58,827
I can explain, Tom, it's just a mistake.

727
00:48:58,827 --> 00:49:00,757
Anybody else here involved in the bribe?

728
00:49:00,757 --> 00:49:02,337
Bribe? There's no bribe!

729
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:06,126
I handed this man an envelope containing a cashed check

730
00:49:06,126 --> 00:49:09,111
- for 200 thousand dollars!
- No, no. Nobody...

731
00:49:09,323 --> 00:49:10,723
I wasn't handed in...

732
00:49:21,133 --> 00:49:21,943
I didn't...

733
00:49:23,435 --> 00:49:24,600
Nobody handed ...

734
00:49:35,324 --> 00:49:37,980
This'll look better for you if you did not deposited that check.

735
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:40,074
- No, no.
- Do you still have it?

736
00:49:40,074 --> 00:49:41,469
I didn't get a check!

737
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:44,828
Sir, we got people searching the lab,

738
00:49:44,828 --> 00:49:46,936
- ceasing the files and computers.
- Good job, Walter.

739
00:49:46,936 --> 00:49:49,281
Victor, we screwed if they find out..

740
00:49:49,367 --> 00:49:51,707
Higgins. Higgins,
You can't do that!

741
00:49:52,061 --> 00:49:53,816
You can't take my computer!

742
00:49:55,574 --> 00:49:58,484
This company has a government offense contracts.

743
00:49:58,484 --> 00:50:02,346
There are very serious rules concerning contact with foreign nations.

744
00:50:02,346 --> 00:50:04,871
The Patriot Act applies here, my friend!

745
00:50:05,233 --> 00:50:07,283
Sir, I can take your underpants.

746
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,913
- Look, look, it's getting a little agressive.
- Yeah.

747
00:50:12,913 --> 00:50:17,123
Sorry, Robert Ntunde, this is Tom Bailey, this gentleman is from Nigeria.

748
00:50:17,123 --> 00:50:19,112
Everybody just take it easy, relax

749
00:50:19,112 --> 00:50:23,807
- I'll be back to explain everything to you..
- Victor, where are you going?

750
00:50:24,952 --> 00:50:26,539
Guys, we got to get rid of this stuff!

751
00:50:26,539 --> 00:50:28,539
Keep srhedding, keep shredding!

752
00:50:29,946 --> 00:50:30,576
Help me!

753
00:50:43,392 --> 00:50:43,787
FBI!

754
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,101
I came alone.

755
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,105
Yes, I know. Thank you, mr. Pirson.

756
00:51:00,164 --> 00:51:03,131
Now, I understand your research was completely wiped out.

757
00:51:03,131 --> 00:51:05,109
I have complete copies right on these hard drives,

758
00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:08,173
along with absolute proof that they were at Bering Aerospace computers

759
00:51:08,173 --> 00:51:10,608
that should be good for a couple of law suits, right?

760
00:51:10,608 --> 00:51:12,188
I drop the investigation

761
00:51:12,247 --> 00:51:15,547
against all parties involved with the original theft.

762
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:18,887
It seems fair, you get your property back.

763
00:51:18,887 --> 00:51:19,462
Agreed.

764
00:51:20,186 --> 00:51:20,996
No charges.

765
00:51:21,733 --> 00:51:23,723
Nothing on you, or your people.

766
00:51:31,658 --> 00:51:33,058
Don't you want money?

767
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:36,930
This particular project has a different revenue stream.

768
00:51:49,655 --> 00:51:54,380
In a massive sell-offs, followed by a federal investigation Bering Aerospace,

769
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,800
the stock dropped 33%

770
00:51:57,309 --> 00:51:59,129
before trade was withholded.

771
00:52:09,411 --> 00:52:09,866
Yeah?

772
00:52:10,734 --> 00:52:12,844
Yeah, you should've just paid us.

773
00:52:16,401 --> 00:52:17,981
I found the transmitter.

774
00:52:17,998 --> 00:52:20,134
You found the transmitter with the blinking light.

775
00:52:20,134 --> 00:52:22,051
Yeah, we wanted you to figure some of that out.

776
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:23,988
Now we just gave you what you expected.

777
00:52:23,988 --> 00:52:25,388
I am Victor Dubenich.

778
00:52:26,287 --> 00:52:27,515
I am gonna beat this.

779
00:52:27,515 --> 00:52:29,237
Aren't you forgetting about the bribe?

780
00:52:29,237 --> 00:52:31,559
Who cares? Can't prove anything, I didn't get any money!

781
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:35,543
- Bingo!
- Yeah, no, it doesn't account for all of us, Sophie kept a little

782
00:52:35,543 --> 00:52:38,183
to buy a truly impressive number of shoes.

783
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,425
What is it with women and shoes?

784
00:52:45,125 --> 00:52:46,572
There's something wrong with you.

785
00:52:46,572 --> 00:52:47,852
That's what I said.

786
00:52:50,247 --> 00:52:53,428
You see, if the company stock price falls 10 - 15% one day

787
00:52:53,428 --> 00:52:56,285
and you see it coming, you sell short and you can make a lot of money.

788
00:52:56,285 --> 00:52:57,740
If it's gonna fall 30%

789
00:52:57,884 --> 00:53:00,469
you can make shattering amounts of money.

790
00:53:01,425 --> 00:53:03,093
We didn't need the FBI to take you to jail,

791
00:53:03,093 --> 00:53:06,603
we just needed them to show, to take boxes out of your office.

792
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:07,528
All day long.

793
00:53:07,869 --> 00:53:10,749
In front of TV cameras, scaring your investors

794
00:53:10,925 --> 00:53:12,863
You going to jail is just a bonus.

795
00:53:12,863 --> 00:53:15,793
So if you telling anything about us to the feds

796
00:53:15,846 --> 00:53:17,771
next time we won't be so nice.

797
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:21,156
Who was that?

798
00:53:24,476 --> 00:53:25,051
Nobody.

799
00:53:34,835 --> 00:53:35,460
I am ...

800
00:53:35,856 --> 00:53:36,666
Job well...

801
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:37,714
Wow.

802
00:53:39,086 --> 00:53:40,950
It was an overlap in the London stock market

803
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:43,715
variation carried over to the NASDAQ, and...

804
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:46,376
I'm just very good at what I do.

805
00:53:46,376 --> 00:53:48,246
This is the score. THE score.

806
00:53:49,799 --> 00:53:51,254
Age of the geek, baby.

807
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,755
Somebody kiss this man, so I don't have to.

808
00:53:55,766 --> 00:53:56,746
So ... we out?

809
00:53:58,227 --> 00:54:00,807
I mean, we out, this is retirement money.

810
00:54:00,919 --> 00:54:03,199
"Go to jet and buy an island" money.

811
00:54:03,982 --> 00:54:04,437
Yeah.

812
00:54:05,559 --> 00:54:07,729
Yeah. A pleasure working with you.

813
00:54:08,993 --> 00:54:10,688
One show only. No anchors.

814
00:54:11,663 --> 00:54:13,658
I've already forgot your names.

815
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:28,477
You know, I've never had that cool time on a job.

816
00:54:28,577 --> 00:54:29,122
It's a walkaway.

817
00:54:29,122 --> 00:54:31,580
And I got focused on it, bro, it kept me right on.

818
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,363
- I'm really good at one thing.
- Parker ...

819
00:54:33,363 --> 00:54:36,337
Only one thing, that's it, but you, you know other things, and then...

820
00:54:36,337 --> 00:54:39,306
- I can't stop doing my one thing, I can't retire...
- Want to know what I think?

821
00:54:39,306 --> 00:54:40,116
Not really.

822
00:54:40,223 --> 00:54:41,799
How long before you fall apart again?

823
00:54:41,799 --> 00:54:42,904
Oh, I'm touched.

824
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:45,184
A guy like you can't be out of the game.

825
00:54:45,184 --> 00:54:47,054
Thats why you need the chase.

826
00:54:47,277 --> 00:54:48,502
Yeah, I'll manage.

827
00:54:49,565 --> 00:54:50,020
Yeah.

828
00:55:02,741 --> 00:55:03,961
You pick the jobs.

829
00:55:04,893 --> 00:55:06,528
My job is helping people.

830
00:55:07,421 --> 00:55:10,258
- I find bad guys.
- Well, go find some bad guys.

831
00:55:10,258 --> 00:55:11,598
Bad guys have money.

832
00:55:13,694 --> 00:55:14,504
Black king.

833
00:55:16,321 --> 00:55:17,251
White Knight.

834
00:55:25,894 --> 00:55:26,644
I'm sorry.

835
00:55:27,154 --> 00:55:27,724
No, no.

836
00:55:28,057 --> 00:55:28,632
Please.

837
00:55:29,337 --> 00:55:30,382
Take your time.

838
00:55:32,194 --> 00:55:32,764
She ...

839
00:55:34,008 --> 00:55:34,933
She was 17...

840
00:55:38,033 --> 00:55:38,603
I know.

841
00:55:40,158 --> 00:55:41,793
They ... They killed her.

842
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:45,836
They said it was an accident.

843
00:55:46,121 --> 00:55:47,876
But the company killed her.

844
00:55:48,989 --> 00:55:50,149
I want them hurt!

845
00:55:53,274 --> 00:55:54,434
We can't pay you.

846
00:55:55,842 --> 00:55:56,937
We work on a ...

847
00:55:58,257 --> 00:55:59,962
alternative revenue sream.

848
00:56:01,541 --> 00:56:02,826
I don't understand.

849
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:05,521
The judge said we couldn't appel on them.

850
00:56:06,108 --> 00:56:07,563
What are you gonna do?

851
00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:09,404
People like them...

852
00:56:11,513 --> 00:56:12,998
corporations like that,

853
00:56:12,998 --> 00:56:15,574
they have all the money, they have all the power.

854
00:56:15,574 --> 00:56:18,198
And they use it to make people like you ...

855
00:56:18,198 --> 00:56:18,828
go away.

856
00:56:20,941 --> 00:56:21,631
Right now

857
00:56:22,114 --> 00:56:24,584
you suffering under an enormous weight.

858
00:56:28,064 --> 00:56:29,049
We provide ...

859
00:56:31,158 --> 00:56:31,853
leverage.
