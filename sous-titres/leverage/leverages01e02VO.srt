THEY MAKE 700 BUCKS A DAY.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,700

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,400

27
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,300
AND IF I'M GONNA WORK --

DR. LAROQUE SAYS I NEED ANOTHER
YEAR AND A HALF OF HARD-CORE REHAB,

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,200
MAYBE TWO MORE SURGERIES.

30
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,300
CASTLEMAN SHOT ME UP.

31
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,000
I JUST WANT THEM TO PAY MY BILLS.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,800
NO MORE, NO LESS.

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,400
HMM.

34
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,100
THE ARMY INVESTIGATION
DETERMINED YOU WERE --

35
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,700
WHAT, THEY SAID YOU WERE HIT BY INSURGENTS?

36
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,800
YEAH, THAT'S BECAUSE CASTLEMAN REFUSED
TO COOPERATE IN THAT INVESTIGATION.

37
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,000
AND THEY CAN DO THAT?

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,200
NO ONE'S STOPPING THEM.

39
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,600
THEY'RE COWBOYS. THEY GO OFF
ALL THE TIME -- BOOM, BOOM.

40
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,700
YOU KNOW,

41

...IS 400 MILES AWAY AND
HAS A 5-MONTH WAITING LIST.

56
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,400
EVERYBODY IN THAT REHAB ROOM IS A RESERVIST.

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,600
WHEN RESERVISTS GET OUT,
THEY GET SENT HOME,

NO MATTER WHERE HOME IS

59
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,900
OR HOW FAR IT IS FROM
THE TREATMENT THEY NEED.

60
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,800
NOBODY THOUGHT THIS THROUGH.

61
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,100
WE'RE NOT A RICH HOSPITAL.

62
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,000
I CASHED IN EVERY FAVOR I HAD

I HAVE TO GO BACK IN THERE

66
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,900
I HAVE TO DO THAT.

RUN YOUR SCAM ON SOMEBODY WITH MONEY.

IT'S NOT A SCAM. I'M HERE TO HELP.

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,800
HARDISON, CALL THEM.

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,200

YOU SHOULD TAKE THAT.

88
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,000
NO, NO. YOU SHOULD TAKE THAT.

00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,400
HELLO?

90
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,600
WHEN?

91
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,500

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,400
5.56 NATO ROUNDS...

181
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,000
MIXED IN WITH SOME 9 MILLS
FROM THE SUBMACHINE GUNS.

182
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,800
INSURGENTS WOULD HAVE USED
AK-47 WITH 7.62 AMMO --

183
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,000
HAS MORE OF A "CRACK."

184
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,100
CONTRACTORS SHOT THEM UP, ALL RIGHT.

185
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,000
YOU I.D.'d THE WEAPON
FROM THE GUNSHOT SOUND.

186
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,300
IT HAS A VERY DISTINCTIVE SOUND.

187
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,900
CASTLEMAN SECURITY IS HARD-CORE, FOLKS,

188
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,800
A BILLION-DOLLAR COMPANY.

189
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,800
THEY GOT FAT GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS
EVERYWHERE WE GOT TROOPS.

190
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,900
THAT'S CHARLES DUFORT, C.E.O.

191
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,400
HE'S VERY PARANOID
AND VERY PROFESSIONAL.

192
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,900
I WANT TO GET THIS CLEAR RIGHT NOW.

193
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,800
THIS IS A PRIVATE ARMY
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING ON.

194
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,500
THEY GOT THEIR OWN INTEL ASSETS.

195
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,200
THEY GOT A LOT OF TRIGGER-PULLERS.

196
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,100
YES, AND LOBBYISTS IN
EVERY OFFICE IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

197
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,000
THE PROBLEM WITH A COVER-UP

198
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,800
IS ALL THE PAPERWORK IT TAKES
TO KEEP THE LIES STRAIGHT.

199
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,900
INTERNAL E-MAILS, MEMOS.

200
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,200
EXACTLY.

201
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,900
- SO...
- LET'S GO TO WORK.

202
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,400
SO, WE STEAL THE EVIDENCE
AND THREATEN TO EXPOSE THEM.

203
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,700
- BLACKMAIL.
- AH, YES...

204
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,300
BUT JUST ENOUGH BLACKMAIL
TO PAY FOR PERRY'S REHAB --

205
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,200
MAYBE A COUPLE OF MILLION MORE IN DAMAGES.

206
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
NEVER HOLD UP IN COURT.

207
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,600
AH, BUT THAT'S WHY
CORPORAL PERRY IS LUCKY.

208
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,600
HE DOESN'T HAVE LAWYERS.
HE HAS THIEVES.

209
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,800
HARDISON.

210
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,300
NEXT TIME, I WEAR THE SUIT.

211
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,700
Dufort's here.
I'll make contact.

212
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,200
SEE WHAT YOU CAN SQUEEZE OUT OF HIM.

213
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,500
PARKER, HARDISON, TIME TO HIT HIS OFFICE.

214
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,400
I-I GOT TO GO BACK TO THE OFFICE.

215
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,500
I-I JUST REMEMBERED SOMETHING.

216
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,300
WHAT?

217
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,700
I JUST REMEMBERED GRAVITY...

218
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,300
AND THE SQUISHINESS
OF ALL MY MANLY BITS.

219
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,900
I DESIGNED THIS RIG MYSELF.

220
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,400
THE LINE IS CARBON FIBER,
FIVE-POINT HARNESS.

221
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,800
WEIGHT SUPPORT HERE, HERE, AND HERE,

222
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,700
AUTOBRAKING RESISTANCE
ON THE MAIN PULLEY BACK HERE.

223
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,700
OKAY. OKAY. C-COOL.
SO IT'S TESTED?

224
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,600
NOT YET.

225
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,900
NOT Y--

226
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,800
WELL, WHEN THE HELL
WAS YOU GONNA TEST IT?

227
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,000
OHH!

228
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
YOU BIG BABY.

229
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,400
SERIOUSLY?

230
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,800
SERIOUSLY?

231
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,200
OKAY, HARDISON, PARKER, GUARD
SWEEPS ARE EVERY 10 MINUTES.

232
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,000
THAT MEANS YOU GOT 9 MINUTES, 30 SECONDS.

233
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,300
I'M WORKING ON IT.

234
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,200
CASTLEMAN IS GONNA BE VERY HAPPY
WITH THE NEW APPROPRIATIONS BILL.

235
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
- PARDON ME, CONGRESSMAN.
- YES.

236
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,900
LILY McREADY. I'M WITH EXECUTIVE ORDERS.

237
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,900
THEY'RE A LONDON-BASED
DEFENSE CONTRACTOR.

238
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,400
- CHARLES DUFORT.
- OH.

239
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,900
EXECUTIVE ORDERS DOESN'T
WORK FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

240
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,100
YET.

241
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,900
PERHAPS WE COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

242
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,100
YES, WELL, UM, IT WAS
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

243
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,000
NOW, YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE ME.

244
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,300
YOU'RE NOT POACHING, ARE YOU?

245
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,400
APPROPRIATIONS BILL 718.

246
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,500
THOSE ARE OUR DEFENSE CONTRACTS.

247
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
DON'T EVEN BOTHER.

248
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,100
MR. DUFORT, SURELY THERE'S
ENOUGH WAR TO GO AROUND.

249
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,800
I RATHER LIKE YOU.

250
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,900
HARDISON, HARDISON, WHAT'S ... 

251
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,400
WHAT'S THIS BILL THEY ARE TALKING ABUOT?

252
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,300
YOU KNOW, I'D LIKE TO
GIVE YOU THE SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK,

253
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,700
BUT THIS MAN HAS AN RFID SECURITY-CARD
READER ON HIS POWER SUPPLY,

254
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,200
SO I'M A LITTLE BUSY.

255
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,700
OOH, OLD-SCHOOL.

256
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,200
I FOUND A SAFE.

257
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,600
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS.

258
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,500
IT'S VOICE-ACTIVATED.

259
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,300
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
ONE PROBLEM AT A TIME.

260
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,000
UR, SOPHIE, I'M GOING IN.

261
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,300
WE NEED TO GET AN RFID CARD TO ELIOT.

262
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,000
MY COMPANY'S FOCUSED ON MEETING SENATORS,

263
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,100
BUT I'M THINKING CONGRESSMEN.

264
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,500
YOU KNOW THE GREAT THING ABOUT CONGRESSMEN?

265
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,700
50, 100 GRAND WELL SPENT
WILL GET ONE ELECTED.

266
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,900
BUT THEN, ONCE THEY'RE IN,

267
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,800
THE INCUMBENCY RATE IS OVER 95%.

268
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,300
SO YOU CAN GET, ON AN AVERAGE,

269
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,500
18, 20 YEARS OF USE OUT OF ONE OF THEM.

270
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,200
IN THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES,

271
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,500
BUYING A UNITED STATES CONGRESSMAN

272
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,500
IS ONE OF THE BEST INVESTMENTS
A CORPORATION CAN MAKE.

273
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,600
OHH, I JUST THREW UP
IN MY MOUTH A LITTLE BIT.

274
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,600
I'M A PROFESSIONAL CRIMINAL,
AND I FIND THAT DISTURBING.

275
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,900
???

276
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,200
WELL,???

277
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,600
NO, OVERTHROWING THE GOVERNMENT
IS TOO HARSH A WAY TO DESCRIBE IT.

278
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,200
WE JUST HELP THEM ALONG.

279
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,900
IT WAS A ??

280
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,500
??

281
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,800
???

282
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,100
- ??
- ???

283
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,200
???

284
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,300
SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD TO GET OUT AND WASH.

285
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,200
OH??

286
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,900
OH, THIS IS THE FIRST DAY I'VE WORN IT.

287
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,300
THANK YOU.

288
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,300
LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET SOMEONE
TO HELP YOU WITH THAT. EXCUSE ME.

289
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,700
- YEAH, GARCON?
- YES, MA'AM?

290
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,600
COULD YOU, UH,

291
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,100
COULD YOU POSSIBLY HELP US?

292
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,700
- WE'VE GOT A LITTLE STAIN ON THIS JACKET.
- ??OH LOOK AT THAT.

293
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,000
- LET ME TAKE CARE OF THAT FOR YOU.
- ??

294
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,900
- IF YOU ??
- LET ME, UH, KEEP THIS.

295
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,100
A MAN IN MY POSITION
SHOULDN'T FORGET HIS WALLET.

296
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,100
THAT'S EMBARRASSING.

297
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,300
THANK YOU.

298
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,300
HERE YOU GO, SIR.
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

299
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,300
THERE'S NO MAGNETIC STRIP.

300
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,700
IT'S A LITTLE RADIO FREQUENCY.

301
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,200
JUST... JUST PUT IT UP NEXT TO
THE PHONE THAT I GAVE YOU.

302
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,300
I'M IN.

303
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,400
PARKER, WHAT'S THE STATUS
OF THE VOICE LOCK?

304
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,400
I'VE BEEN SAMPLING DUFORT'S SPEECH,

305
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,200
BUT I STILL NEED A FEW MORE SOUNDS.

306
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,700
How many?

307
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,300
OH, I ONLY NEED THE SOUNDS
"PUH," "TUH," "OOH," "UH,"

308
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,200
"EH," "OH," "AH,"
"KUH," "AY," "EFF."

309
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,700
AH, ONLY THOSE.

310
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,100
ELIOT?

311
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,000
I'M ON IT.

312
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,800
HELLO.

313
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,800
HELLO.

314
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,500
- OOH.
- MMM.

315
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,500
APPETIZER, SIR?

316
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,200
SURE. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

317
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,300
I'VE GOT THE P‚TES D'ESCARGOT
AVEC BEURRE D'ARGENTINE...

318
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,700
AND WHAT LOOKS LIKE
OLD DUCK, KIND OF GREASY.

319
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,300
I GUESS I'LL HAVE THE FIRST ONE.

320
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,700
BUT OF COURSE.

321
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,000
WELL?

322
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,300
MAY I HAVE SOME?

323
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,400
THE GREASY DUCK?

324
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,900
OOH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

325
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,100
I WOULDN'T HAVE THE GREASY DUCK.

326
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,200
NO, I WOULDN'T SUGGEST IT.

327
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,100
NO, THE OTHER ONE!

328
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,700
THE P‚TES D'ESCARGOT
WITH THE BEURRE ARGENTINE!

329
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,300
EXCELLENT CHOICE.

330
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,600
PRETTY GOOD. YOU GOT MOST OF THEM.

331
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,500
OKAY, NOW ALL I NEED IS
"EFF," "UH," AND "KUH."

332
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,200
THIS IS SHRIMP!

333
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,000
???

334
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,900
IT'S SHRIMP, YOU STUPID FU--

335
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,400
OHH! THERE THEY ARE.

336
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,300
REALLY LOUD, TOO.

337
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,100
OKAY, SOPHIE, START THE WALKAWAY.

338
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,800
I was wondering,
could I drop by your office?

339
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,700
Anytime.

340
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,500
Where are you going?

341
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,800
PLAYING A HUNCH.

342
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,300
ALL RIGHT, WELL, PLAY IT FAST.

343
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,900
HARDISON, WHAT DO YOU GOT?
YOU GOT THREE MINUTES.

344
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,100
TOO MUCH.

345
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,400
I GOT ALL OF PERRY'S MEDICAL RECORDS.

346
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,300
??SURE, THAT'S --
THAT'S PRETTY NORMAL,

347
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,500
BUT I'VE GOT PSYCH EVALUATIONS,
HIGH-SCHOOL RECORDS.

348
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,900
THEY'RE READING HIS E-MAILS.

349
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,200
TAPPING HIS PHONES.

350
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,700
I'VE GOT SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS OF PERRY
HERE FROM THE HOSPITAL YESTERDAY.

351
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,700
WHY ARE THEY SPENDING SO MUCH
MONEY WATCHING OUR GUY?

352
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,200
I MEAN, THE INVESTIGATIONS OF
THE SHOOTING WERE DONE MONTHS AGO.

353
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,900
SEE THOSE GUYS?

354
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,900
PRIVATE CONTRACTORS.

355
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,200
BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SHOOTING.

356
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,600
THE COVER-UP HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE SHOOTING.

357
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,200
IT'S ABOUT THE TRUCKS.

358
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,200
CONGRESSMAN.

359
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
UH, YES?

360
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,200
YOUR SUPPORT ON THE NEXT APPROPRIATIONS
BILL WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL.

361
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,600
WE'VE ALREADY EARMARKED THE
NO-BID CONTRACTS FOR CASTLEMAN.

362
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,800
- THEY DESERVE IT.
- NOBODY'S PERFECT.

363
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,800
LOOK AT ALL THE TROUBLE THEY HAD
WITH THAT SHOOTING IN NAJAF.

364
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,700
I'M SORRY?

365
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,300
I DON'T REALLY FOLLOW
THAT SORT OF NEWS.

366
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,800
I JUST REVIEW THE CONTRACTS.

367
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,300
OF COURSE.

368
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,200
EXCUSE ME.

369
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,100
PARKER, HARDISON, BUG OUT,
GO BACK TO THE OFFICE.

370
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,200
WE'RE GOING TO THE HOSPITAL.

371
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,700
YOU NEED TO TALK??

372
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,900
THE SHOOTING WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

373
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,400
PERRY ISN'T A VICTIM. HE'S A WITNESS.

374
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,600
CASTLEMAN STRIKE YOU
AS THE KIND OF COMPANY

375
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,400
THAT WOUEP A WITNESS ALIVE?

376
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,200
HE'S NOT IN HIS DAMN ROOM.

377
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,700
I'M CHECKING ALL THE CORRIDORS

378
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,700
THAT ARE CONNECTED
TO THE EXTERIOR DOORS.

379
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
SORRY, DOC,
I KNOW IT'S CLOSED, BUT --

380
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
MR. FORD?

381
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,900
WE GOT TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE NOW.

382
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,000
WHY?

383
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,900
CASTLEMAN.

384
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,800
- ???
- SOPHIE DEVEREAUX. OOH!

385
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,400
- ???HERE WE GO.
- WATCH THOSE HANDS, MR. PERRY.

386
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,600
I'M IN A WHEELCHAIR.
I'M NOT BLIND.

387
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,300
LET'S GO.

388
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,300
IT AIN'T GETTING CLEAR.
I CAN'T FIND --

389
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,800
EXCUSE ME, DO YOU WORK ON THIS FLOOR?

390
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,500
I, UH -- WHAT FLOOR IS THIS?

391
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,600
I'M IN ORTHOPEDICS, SO --

392
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,200
HEY! HEY!

393
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,000
GET THE ELEVATOR!

394
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,300
MR. FORD!

395
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,600
HELLO.

396
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,300
AAH!

397
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,400
GO!

398
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,400
WE GOT ALL THIS STUFF
ONE OF THE CASTLEMAN HITTERS.

399
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,000
???

400
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,700
THIS IS A SUICIDE NOTE.

401
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,400
THIS GUN IS REGISTERED
IN ROBERT PERRY'S NAME.

402
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,600
THE BILL OF SALE BELONGS TO A
SHOP A MILE FROM HIS HOUSE.

403
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,000
I GOT PERRY SQUARED AWAY IN A SAFE HOUSE.

404
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,100
PLAYTIME'S OVER, NATE.

405
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,100
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
UNTIL THEY COME AFTER US.

406
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,200
THE TALL ONE,
THE WAY HE USED THE˙KNIFE --

407
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,400
EX-MARINE, PROBABLY FORCE RECON.

408
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,300
YOU I.D.'d A GUY
OFF HIS KNIFE-FIGHTITYLE?

409
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,800
IT'S A VERY DISTINCTIVE STYLE.

410
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,900
THAT'S FOR LATER.

411
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,500
I DIDN'T SIGN UP FOR AN THIS.

412
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,800
WHAT I DID BEFORE, NO GOT HURT.

413
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,100
STOLE PAINTINGS FOR A LIVING.

414
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,800
I NEVER HURT ANYBODY.

415
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,600
I ACTUALLY HURT PEOPLE, SO...

416
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,600
NATE, IF ANYTHING
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED --

417
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,900
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS CALLED ME.

418
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,500
YOU... YOU REMEMBER?

419
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,100
YOU BEGGED ME TO RUN THE CREW,
AGREED TO PLAY BY MY RULES.

420
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,200
NOW, WALK OUT IF YOU
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

421
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,000
WALK OUT ANY DAY IF YOU
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

422
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,500
IT'S SIMPLE.

423
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,700
WE FINISH THIS ONE.

424
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,900
JUST ONE.

425
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
HOW DO WE HIT 'EM?

426
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,700
CONGRESSMAN JENKINS. HE'S OUR IN.

427
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,700
HE LOOKED ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYE

428
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,700
AND TOLD ME HE NEVER
EVEN HEARD OF THE SHOOTING.

429
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,600
SO?

430
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,900
LOOKED ME IN THE EYE?

431
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,400
???THEY'RE NOT LOOKING ME IN THE EYE.

432
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,600
MEN ONLY REALLY LOOK A WOMAN IN THE EYE

433
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,800
WHEN THEY'RE MAKING
THE EFFORT TO LIE TO HER.

434
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,500
WELL, YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT.

435
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,100
NOTED AND FILED.

436
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,100
ALL RIGHT, JENKINS IS
DUFORT'S PET CONGRESSMAN.

437
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,500
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET HIM TO BIT

438
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,200
THE BEST WAY TO GET TWO PEOPLE
TO REVEAL A SECRET --

439
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,000
GET THEM TO TURN ON EACH OTHER.

440
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,300
MAY I PUT THAT AWAY FOR YOU?

441
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,600
THAT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE A QUESTION.

442
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,400
WASHINGTON,DC

443
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,500
CONGRESSMAN JENKINS.

444
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,600
OH, UM.

445
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,500
EXECUTIVE ORDERS, THE EUROPEAN COMPANY,

446
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,700
FROM THE FUND-RAISER, RIGHT?

447
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,400
THAT'?RIGHT.

448
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,300
I REMEMBER YOU FROM THE FUND-RAISER.

449
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,300
PLEASE.(Los Angeles)

450
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,400
TOM ABRAMS. YOU CAN CALL ME TOMMY.

451
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,500
YOU DON'T WORK FOR
CONGRESSMAN JES, DO YOU?

452
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,200
I DO NOT.

453
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,500
NO, I WORK FOR CONGRESSMAN
CALLOwAY, FROM UPS.

454
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,400
WE ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH FRIENDS
ON THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE.

455
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,100
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WILL AHE UD STATES
IN THEIR FOREIGN OPERATIONS

456
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,700
IF THEY KNOW THAT EUROPEAN COMPANIES
ARE GONNA REAP SOME OF THE BENEFITS.

457
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,400
SOME HELP IN THE APPROPRIATIONS BILL --

458
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,800
I SUPPORT AMERICAN COMPANIES.

459
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,900
- LIKE CASTLEMAN?
- LIKE CASTLEMAN.

460
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,800
AND THEY SUPPORT, UH, THE COUNTRY.

461
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,500
WELL, I'M HERE BECAUSE CONGRESSMAN
CALLOWAY WANTED ME TO LET YOU KNOW

462
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,300
THAT HE'S OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS NOW THAT

463
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,500
CONGRESSMAN JENKINS HAS GONE SOFT ON YOU.

464
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,000
JENKINS AL DELIVERS.

465
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
JENKINS TOLD MY BOSS, TO HIS FACE...

466
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,000
THAT HE'S TIRED OF COVERING FOR YOU.

467
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,600
WE'VE BACKED HIM FOR YEARS.

468
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,700
WELL, JES WANTED MY
BOSS TO MEET THIS WOMAN

469
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,600
FROM A BRITISH COMPANY --

470
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,000
EH...UH....

471
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,600
EXECUTIVE ORDERS.

472
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,700
I DIDN'T PICK YOU AT RANDOM, CONGRESSMAN.

473
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,500
CASTLEMAN CAN BE A FICKLE FRIEND.

474
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,800
RUMOR HAS IT THEY'RE
LOOKING FOR SOME FRESH BLOOD.

475
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,600
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

476
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,900
IF YOUR EARMARKS
AND YOUR NO-BID CONTRACTS

477
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,600
ARE STILL IN THAT APPROPRIATIONS BILL,

478
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,100
???

479
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,100
BUT IF THEY'RE NOT,

480
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,000
WELL, CONGRESSMAN CALLOWAY WOULD
BE OPEN TO ENJOYING THE SAME FAVORS

481
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,400
THAT JENKINS HAS ENJOYED
FOR ALL THESE YEARS.

482
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,400
BUT OF COURSE,
JENKINS HAS NEW FRIENDS NOW.

483
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,400
YOU SHOULD LOOK OUT
FOR THE SIGNS, CONGRESSMAN --

484
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,700
MISSED PHONE CALLS...

485
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,300
NO MORE LITTLE FAVORS.

486
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,000
THOSE ARE THE SAME SIGNS THAT
YOUR WIFE IS CHEATING ON YOU.

487
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,900
THAT'S RIGHT.

488
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,400
AND WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WHEN THAT HAPPENS?

489
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,100
PLAY THE FIELD.

490
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,800
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR COMING, TOMMY.

491
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,700
PLEASURE.

492
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,400
CONGRESSMAN JENKINS IS VERY CAREFUL.

493
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,100
IRECT BRIBES,
BUT HE'S RENOVATING HIS HOUSE,

494
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,700
AND SO FAR, HE'S RECEIVED
OVER $600,000 WORTH OF WORK

495
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,200
FOR A LITTLE OVER 50 GRAND.

496
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,300
CASTLEMAN OWNS THE CONTRACTING COMPANY, HUH?

497
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,500
I MEAN, HE'S GOING THROUGH LIKE
THREE SHELL COMPANIES, BUT, YEAH.

498
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,200
THIS MAN LOVES HIS HOUSE.

499
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,000
JUST CHECK OUT HIS
WEB-BROWSING HABITS. LOOK HERE.

500
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,400
YOU SEE, THE MAN SPTHREE WEEKS PICKING
OUT THE PERFECT MAHOGANY WOOD PANELS.

501
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,900
THIS SITE IS LIKE WOOD PORN.

502
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,400
IS HIS HOUSE FINISHED?

503
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,700
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

504
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,800
CAN I OWR PHONE?

505
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,800
HELlo. YES.

506
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,800
I'D LIKE TO CANCEL DELIVERY ON SOME
MAHOGANY WOOD PANELING, PLEASE.

507
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,800
- ??
- THE JENKINS HOUSE, YEAH.

508
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,200
YOU KNOW WHAT, DO ME A FA MAN.

509
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,000
JUST GO AHEAD AND CANCEL THE WHOLE ORDER.

510
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,200
YES, SIR.

511
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,900
WHAT'S HE DOING?

512
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,900
YANKING THE CONGRESSMAN'S CHAIN.

513
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,800
AHA!

514
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,800
PARKER STARTED HER RUN YET?

515
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,500
JUST NOW.

516
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,200
YOU KNOW, I STILL THINK
IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR ME 

517
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,100
TO JUST HACK THE BILL
IN THE PRINTER QUEUE.

518
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,900
NO, NO. NO COMPUTERS, NO.

519
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,800
A BILL IS PUT INTO A WOODEN BOX ON THE
CONGRESSIONAL FLOOR CALLED THE HOPPER.

520
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,200
A WOODEN -- WHOA, WHOA.
A WOODEN -- A WOODEN BOX?

521
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,500
- A WOODEN BOX.
- woOD?

522
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,500
OH, WE CAN PUT A MAN ON THE MOON,

523
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,000
BUT ALL OUR LAWS
GO INTO A WOODEN BOX.

524
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,100
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS,
WE NEED TO GET DUFORT

525
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,100
TO BELIEVE THAT JENKINS
IS ABANDONING HIM,

526
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,700
THAT JENKINS SUBMITTED
THE APPROPRIATIONS BILL

527
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,500
THAT DOE HAVE ANY OF THE
USUAL COntRACTS FOR CASTLEMAN,

528
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:24,800
WHICH MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO PUT
OUR OWN PAGES INTO THE BILL.

529
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,900
THAT MEANS THE ONLY PLACE
THAT WE COULD GET AT IT WO--

530
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,100
AHH! OKAY.

531
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,200
- ???
- ??

532
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,700
I MEAN, BREAK A LAW,
EVERYBODY'S DONE THAT.

533
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,300
- MY MAMA'S DONE THAT.
- UH-HUH.

534
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,100
BUT STEAL A LAW...

535
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
OH, SHE'S GONNA BE A LEGEND, BABY.

536
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,200
THE EAGLE HAS LANDED.

537
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,600
- IT'S IN. UHH!
- GO AHEAD, GIRL.

538
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,500
SEXINESS, UHH!

539
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,300
I LIKE IT.

540
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,900
YOU MIGHT WANT TO EASE UP
ON THAT A LITTLE BIT.

541
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,300
- I'M JUST SAYING,
- YEAH.

542
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,800
BETWEEN ME AND YOU.

543
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,700
NEVER LEAVES THE ROOM.

544
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,200
HI, SO, HOW WASHINGTON?

545
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,900
WELL, VILLAINS, CON MEN,
WOLVES IN CHEEP'S CLOTHING.

546
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,300
I FELT RIGHT AT HOME.

547
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,700
THIS IS PRETTY AMAZING.
LISTEN TO THEM.

548
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,900
??This is your
contractor's problem.

549
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,100
Oh, please. Let's not pretend.

550
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,000
You pulled all our earmarks
from the appropriations...

551
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,900
THERE'S ABOUT AN HOUR OF THIS,
BUT HERE'S THE HIGH POINT.

552
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,200
Somebody screwed up.
I've always been there for you.

553
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,500
I called Manila.

554
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,300
I cleared customs for
you in Los Angeles.

555
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,000
And that was a risk!

556
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,100
NOW, AFTER THAT,
THERE'S -- IT'S --

557
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,700
WELL, WHATEVER YOU CALL THE "RICH
GUYS ON TELEPHONES" VERSION OF MAKEUP SEX.

558
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,500
BUT NOW WE KNOW,

559
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,000
CASTN MAKES A THOUSAND SHIPMENTS A MONTH.

560
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,400
BUT ONE SHIPPED THROMANILA,
RIGHT AFTER THE SHOOTING,

561
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,500
LINKED TO PHONE RECORDS
OM THE CONGRESSMAN.

562
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,000
THEIR SHIPMENTS COME THROUGH HERE.

563
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:09,700
NOW, SOMEWHERE IN THIS
MADNESS IS CONTAINER 541.

564
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,100
IT'S CURRENTLY SITTING
AT THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES.

565
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,800
WHAT'S IN IT?

566
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,500
NO IDEA, BUT IT'S MOVING IN TWO DAYS...

567
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,300
HEADING TO THE MAIN CASTLEMAN
STORAGE FACILITY IN KANSAS.

568
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,200
NOW, THAT --

569
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,700
THAT'S WHY THEY TRIED TO HIT
PERRY, RIGHT THERE, THAT'S IT.

570
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,100
YEAH, WANTED TO TIE UP ALL THE LOOSE ENDS

571
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,100
BEFORE THEY TUCK THIS
ONE AWAY AT HOME BASE.

572
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,800
WHAT DO YOU SHIP IN A CRATE FROM IRAQ?

573
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,400
OH, BOY.

574
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,200
SOMETHING WORTH KILLING FOR.

575
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,600
Port of Los Angeles

576
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,600
HOW'S SECURITY?

577
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,400
DOCKYARD ENTRANCE IS NO PROBLEM.

578
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,000
THERE IT IS. IT'S 541.

579
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,200
HOLD UP, RAMBO.

580
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,100
OKAY, NO LASERS. NO MOTION DETECTORS.

581
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,900
NO VIBRATIONS, NO -- WHOOPS.

582
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,900
WHAT "WHOOPS"?

583
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,000
THERE'S A WEBCAM.

584
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
I'M PICKING UP ITS
BROADCAST ON MY PHONE.

585
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,700
I SEE IT, UP ON THAT POLE.

586
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,100
I JUST HAVE TO SPOOF THE I.P. ADDRESS

587
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,400
AND OVERLAY A DIGITAL
DUPLICATE ON THE Wi-Fi AND --

588
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,100
- OR THAT.
- LET'S GO. COME ON.

589
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,600
I'M SORRY IT WAS TOO FAR
AWAY FOR YOU TO PUNCH.

590
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,400
I'M SURE THAT ALLY FRUSTRATES YOU.

591
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,100
POSITION ONE, WHAT'S YOUR STATUS?

592
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,200
???Just done walking the perimeter.

593
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,100
COPY THAT. I'M ON MY WAY.

594
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,300
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS IN THERE?

595
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,900
ARTIFACTS FROM BAGHDAD MUSEUMS,

596
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,700
MAYBE SOME FROM THE SADDAM PALACES.

597
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,100
NO, I BET IT'S WEAPONS.

598
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,700
A LOT OF BACK-ALLEY ARMS-DEALING
GOING ON IN A WAR ZONE.

599
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,500
MONEY'S GOOD, TOO.

600
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,800
HEY! LINE OF SIGHT.

601
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,800
YOU SHOULDN'T BE AWAY
FROM THAT CONTAINER.

602
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,200
SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH THE WEBCAM.

603
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,800
GET SOME MEN UP THEREp
AND FIX THAT WEBCAM.

604
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,100
I WANT IT WORKING IN AN HOUR. MOVE.

605
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,800
OKAY.

606
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,000
THAT'S WORTH KILLING FOR.

607
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,700
ULTRAVIOLET CHECKS OUT,
PAPER CHECKS OUT.

608
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,600
THE WATERMARKS, THE INK,
IT ALL CHECKS OUt.

609
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,600
THERE'S A WHOLE CONTAINER OF IT,
FROM IRAQ OF ALL PLACES.

610
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,100
IT'S GOT TO BE COUNTERFEIT.

611
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,100
NO, IT'S REAL.

612
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,900
IT FEELS(zEAL.

613
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,400
HEY, WHAT DO YOU GOT GOING ON?
YOU AND HARDISON?

614
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,200
WHAT IS IT, LIKE A CREEPY CONTEST?

615
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,400
I DON'T KNOW, WHAT IS IT,
$200, $300 MILLION IN U.S. CURRENCY.

616
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,700
WHAT'S IT DOING IN IRAQ?

617
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,800
WE SENT IT THERE.

618
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:39,700
WHAT?

619
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,800
BEGINNING OF THE IRAQ WAR,

620
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,300
MY OLD COMPANY HELPED INSURE

621
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,100
THE LARGEST CURRENCY TRANSFER IN HISTORY.

622
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:51,600
BILLIONS AND BILLIONS
IN 1s, 5s, AND 20s, ALL CASH,

623
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,100
SENT TO IRAQ FOR RECONSTRUCTION.

624
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,100
BRIBES.

625
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,500
AS NEEDED.

626
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,000
$9 BILLION WENT MISSING.

627
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,000
WAIT. BILLION WITH A "B"?

628
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:09,000
$9 BILLION
OF U.S. TAXPAYER MONEY JUST...

629
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,000
DISAPPEARED?

630
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,800
CASTLEMAN GETS A CUT OF THE BOOTY.

631
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,900
THE DAY THEY GO TO MOVE IT,

632
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,500
REAL SOLDIERS,
THEY SEE THE TRANSFER.

633
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,900
ONE OF THE CONTRACTORS
SPOOKS, STARTS SHOOTING.

634
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,300
YEAH, BUT CORPORAL PERRY
DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

635
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,700
WELL, THEY DON'T KNOW THAT.

636
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,600
BUT CASTLEMAN'S
A BILLION-DOLLAR COMPANY.

637
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,500
WHY WOULD THEY EVEN CARE
ABOUT THIS CASH?

638
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,400
BECAUSE IT'S CASH.

639
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,700
YOU KNOW, MONEY IS MONEY.
THAT'S ONE THING.

640
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,300
CASH IS A WHOLE OTHER THING.

641
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,000
FOR ALL THE MONEY IN THE ECONOMY,

642
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,200
THERE'S ONLY ABOUT $500 IN CASH
FOR EVERY AMERICAN, THAT'S IT.

643
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,800
UNTRACEABLE SMALL BILLS --

644
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,200
PERFECT FOR SLUSH FUNDS, OR, UM...

645
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,300
IMPROVEMENTS FOR A U.S. CONGRESSMAN.

646
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,100
SMALL-TIME DONORS,
YOU KNOw, FOR RE-ELECTION.

647
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,100
NO ELECTROTRAIL.

648
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,700
IT'S MONEY-LAUNDERING.

649
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,700
HOW SO?

650
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,100
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
CASTLEMAN USES THE ILLEGAL CASH

651
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,400
TO RE-ELECT HIS CONGRESSMAN.

652
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,700
CONGRESSMAN GETS HIM NO-BID
CONTRACTS FOR GOVERNMENT JOBS.

653
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,300
AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT...

654
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,600
...PAYS FOR HIS SERVICES
WITH LEGAL MONEY.

655
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,800
AND THERE'S THE CIRCLE RIGHT THERE.

656
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,300
THEY TURNED THE ENTIRE U.S. GOVERNMENT
INTO A MONEY-LAUNDERING SCAM.

657
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,100
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- ???I'M IMPRESSED.

658
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,000
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THIS, EVER --

659
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,600
THAt IS JUST WAY TOO MUCH MONEY TO STEAL.

660
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,200
NO, YOU'RE NOT GONNA STEAL IT.

661
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,800
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

662
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,700
YOU'RE THE GOOD GUYS NOW.

663
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,300
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE IT BACK.

664
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,500
Port of Los Angeles

665
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,500
CHECK THE PERIMETER.

666
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,300
START YOUR ROUNDS.

667
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,000
THE CAR IS RIGHT OTHERE!

668
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,100
- ???you two.
- I TOLD YOU

669
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,600
WE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE SHUTTLE BUS.

670
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,100
I PAID THEM $2,000 FOR FOOD POISONING.

671
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,500
THEY'RE NOT GETTING ANOTHER CENT!

672
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,900
I HAVE TO HEAR THIS AGAIN?

673
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,300
HEY, HEY, YOU, HEY.
COME HERE, COME HERE.

674
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,700
WHERE'S THE PACIFICA CRUISE,
THE PARKING LOT?

675
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,800
YOU PEOPLE HAVE TO
MOVE AWAY FROM THIS AREA.

676
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,900
YEAH, WELL, I'M TRYING TO, JACKASS.

677
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,600
JUST TELL ME WHERE MY CAR IS!

678
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,800
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT,
START A FIGHT, WHY DON'T YOU?

679
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,100
- AAH!
- OHH!

680
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,200
EXCUSE ME.

681
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:38,500
YES, SIR?

682
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,000
- hey yes.
- CONGRESSMAN!

683
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,800
- Hello, WHAT A PLEASURE!
- LOOK, I PAID A FORTUNE

684
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,400
FOR THESE MAHOGAANELS,

685
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,300
AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW
WHERE THE HELL THEY ARE.

686
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,900
I CAN HELP YOU WITH
THAT RIGHT HERE, SIR.

687
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,400
THEY CHANGED THE LOCK.

688
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,600
JUST DO WHAT YOU DO.

689
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,200
I MEAN, WHATEVER. WHAT YOU NEED?

690
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,600
NAH. MNH-MNH.

691
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,200
STOP ALL THAT PLAYIN'. MNH-MNH.

692
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,400
HELL NO.

693
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,700
AFTER SQUEEZING OUT THREE BRATS --

694
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,300
- AAH! HERE WE GO AGAIN.
- TREATS ME TO A LITTLE ROMANCE,

695
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:12,800
- HEY,

CONGRESSMAN, WHAT IS ALL THIS?
WHAT HAVE YOU UNCOVERED HERE?

768
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,500

769
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,400
CORRUPTION.

770
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,600

AND IN THE COURSE OF HIS COMPANY'S
VERY PATRIOTIC WORK IN IRAQ,

772
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,500

THEFT OF U.S. CURRENCY.

OUR INTEL REVEALED

774
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,500

IRAQ SOME TIME LAST MONTH.

775
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:48,300
I KNEW THAT I WOULD NEED HIGH-LEVEL
HELP UNRAVELING THIS CONSPIRACY,

WAR-PROFITEERING CONTINUE.

CONGRESSMAN, IS THIS A CONFESSION?

00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,200

- I DON'T KNOW.

795
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,700

796
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,400

SHOW THEM.

799
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,100
AN EMPTY TRUCK?

800
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,500
NOTHING UP MY SLEEVE.

801
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,900
- IS THIS STOLEN?
- NOT ANYMORE.

802
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,000
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH IT?

803
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,200
PAY FOR CORPORAL PERRY'S REHAB.

804
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,900
AND SOME OTXER GUYS' REHABS.

805
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,400

THANK YOU.

812
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,700
THE WORLD DOESN'T WORK THIS WAY.

SO CHANGE THE WORLD.

814
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:58,300

WE CAN TAKE CARE OF EVERYBODY.

820
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,800
*WHILE I WAIT *

821
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,000

00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,100
NO, YOU DON'T GET HALF.

823
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,200
YES, I DO! I GET IT HALF. 

824
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,800
ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO WALK
AWAY CAN DO IT RIGHT NOW.

825
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,100

NICE. TEAM SPIRIT.

831
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,200
WHAT DOES IT DO?

832
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,700
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GAVE
ALL YOUR MONEY AWAY.

833
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,300
YOU DIDN'T BUY YOURSELF ANYTHING?

834
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,800
I BOUGHT A CAR.

835
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,400
PROBABLY A STATION WAGON.

836
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,100
- AN ELECTRIC CAR.
- OF COURSE.

837
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,100
HOW SWEET. DO YOU
HAVE TO WIND IT UP?

838
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,400
EH, JUST TRYING TO BE RESPONSIBLE.

839
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,400
RESPONSIBLE?

840
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,800
YOU KNOW, IT SUCKS TO BE THE GOOD GUY.

841
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,500
YOU HAVEN'T FIGURED IT OUT YET, HAVE YOU?

842
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,900
JUST 'CAUSE
YOU'RE THE GOOD GUYS NOW...

843
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,200
DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T HAVE
A LITTLE FUN ALONG THE WAY.

844
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,400
WHOO-HOO.
