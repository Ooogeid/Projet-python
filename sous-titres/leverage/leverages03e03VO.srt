1
00:00:24,216 --> 00:00:25,125
This way!

2
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,031
Infrared, now!

3
00:00:33,824 --> 00:00:34,784
Good. Go!

4
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:37,536
Spread down left. You two, right!

5
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,898
<i>Then we'll meet a man with proof
that some of the founding fathers</i>

6
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:42,982
<i>were a lot racier than we thought.</i>

7
00:00:43,107 --> 00:00:45,835
<i>But first, Dr. Thomas Swift
defends his theory</i>

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,683
<i>that Vikings were the first settlers
in new England.</i>

9
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:51,410
<i>I'm Janet Lin reporting live,
channel 6 news.</i>

10
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:55,596
You know, technically,
these are our offices.

11
00:00:58,165 --> 00:00:59,951
You know, I sleep upstairs.

12
00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:02,085
What am I supposed to do,
cook on a hotplate?

13
00:01:02,557 --> 00:01:03,396
Try this.

14
00:01:12,354 --> 00:01:13,781
Prison kitchen, six months.

15
00:01:14,387 --> 00:01:17,084
I should've had you cook me
breakfast a long time ago.

16
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,580
Are we ever gonna talk
about that kiss?

17
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:22,749
Kiss?

18
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,348
I don't remember a kiss.

19
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:28,445
I remember a slap.

20
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,818
You're still working off the slap.

21
00:01:43,587 --> 00:01:44,979
This had better be good.

22
00:01:46,288 --> 00:01:47,440
Parker's in trouble.

23
00:01:49,223 --> 00:01:50,192
Who is this?

24
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,481
No time for that, Ford.
She went in without me.

25
00:01:52,606 --> 00:01:55,217
She's alone, and they have
a Steranko security system.

26
00:01:55,342 --> 00:01:56,741
You know what that means.

27
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,410
A Steranko?
Parker tried to crack a Steranko?

28
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,667
You've got to help her, Ford.
I can't get to her.

29
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:05,117
- I'm on the building across the street.
- Let's fan out. Check the roof.

30
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,412
What? Parker took an outside job?

31
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:12,798
I'll call Eliot. You call Hardison.
Tell him to meet us at Parker's place.

32
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,342
- Is she in trouble?
- Way more than trouble.

33
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:26,145
No sign yet, but we're close.

34
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,399
It's only a matter of time.

35
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,253
The rich and powerful
take what they want.

36
00:02:38,378 --> 00:02:39,742
We steal it back for you.

37
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:51,253
Sometimes, bad guys
make the best good guys.

38
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,918
We provide leverage.

39
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:06,211
This can't be Parker's place.

40
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:09,438
The address on central square?
That's a dummy. She's got six of 'em.

41
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,690
What?
She still doesn't trust us?

42
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,596
She took an outside job
without telling.

43
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:15,486
Who knows what goes on
in that girl's head?

44
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:16,695
Great, a keypad.

45
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,323
Wait. This is Parker's place.

46
00:03:20,487 --> 00:03:22,137
Parker picked the code.

47
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:31,959
- Unbelievable.
- Maybe I do know her after all.

48
00:03:32,084 --> 00:03:35,911
- You're not gonna tell me what it is?
- Sure. It's my real name.

49
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,556
Oh, my god.

50
00:03:51,103 --> 00:03:52,653
I didn't expect this.

51
00:03:54,832 --> 00:03:56,267
This is surreal.

52
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,026
She lives here?

53
00:04:02,997 --> 00:04:04,759
"Archie"? Who the hell is Archie?

54
00:04:10,637 --> 00:04:12,201
This is a little freaky.

55
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,671
Really?
This is exactly what I expected.

56
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,257
What happened to you guys?
You should've beaten us here.

57
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:22,261
- We went to the wrong address.
- The central square address?

58
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,096
Yeah, the central...

59
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:34,982
Yeah, the central square...
I tracked your phone.

60
00:04:35,821 --> 00:04:39,195
All right, listen. She left timetables,
Security codes, schematics.

61
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:42,114
Let's look at all this stuff and see
where she went and what she's after.

62
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,076
God, this is so well-organized.
She's got everything laid out just so.

63
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,038
- This is as clean as one of your plans.
- Maybe you're rubbing off on her.

64
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,333
I doubt I'm rubbing off on her.
She would have never tried to beat a...

65
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:55,210
Steranko?

66
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,166
- A Steranko.
- On her own? Has she lost her mind?

67
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:01,091
Please. Somebody explain to me...
What the hell is a Steranko?

68
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,396
Steranko's the toughest security system
in the world, in the universe,

69
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:07,431
- in the multi... whatever.
- How do you not know this?

70
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,057
I am a grifter.

71
00:05:09,182 --> 00:05:11,791
If I'm doing my job right,
then the mark just...

72
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:13,899
turns off the alarm for me.

73
00:05:14,024 --> 00:05:16,741
You take one of those computers
that can beat like 100 people at chess,

74
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:18,538
it's got a brain
the size of a building.

75
00:05:18,663 --> 00:05:22,238
You hook it up to military-grade,
infrared, ultrasound, motion sensors...

76
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,657
And then give it the personality
of a pissed-off rottweiler.

77
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:25,912
That's a Steranko.

78
00:05:26,037 --> 00:05:27,932
It has a heuristic algorithm.

79
00:05:28,551 --> 00:05:31,075
It adapts to your moves
and evolves a strategy

80
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,207
based on your response.
It learns.

81
00:05:33,574 --> 00:05:34,708
It hunts.

82
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:36,961
- Can you crack it?
- Can I crack...

83
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:39,338
Steranko's like Mount Everest.

84
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,135
You don't just jump on it.
You gotta train, muscle up.

85
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,942
For Parker, can you crack it?

86
00:05:49,105 --> 00:05:50,389
Yeah, I can...

87
00:05:50,514 --> 00:05:53,151
Even if I tried...
Just tried...

88
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,419
I can't do it remote.
I'd have to get in that building.

89
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,900
So, we get you in, you open
the doors for Parker, she goes out.

90
00:06:00,223 --> 00:06:02,653
Through what? Where?
We don't even know where she's at.

91
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:07,652
The Wakefield building, downtown.

92
00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:13,044
Let's go steal a Parker.

93
00:06:25,048 --> 00:06:27,667
Wakefield agriculture,
worldwide incorporated.

94
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,035
Now, Wakefield's a big player
in the world cereal market,

95
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,891
and by "Cereal" I mean
wheat, corn, rice...

96
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:36,020
- So it's a grocery store.
- Yeah, if Godzilla's a gecko.

97
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,604
They do $200 million a year

98
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,107
in biotech research
and third-world infrastructure.

99
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,692
So it's a massive grocery store.

100
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:44,653
Yeah, but even they weren't
immune to the financial crunch.

101
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,156
The last two years,
they did a bunch of bad investments,

102
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,158
research that turned up empty.

103
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,411
This guy here, CEO Charles rushing?
The board's after his head.

104
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,205
Now, he avoided two takeover attempts,
but he's running scared.

105
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:57,134
I just swept the perimeter.

106
00:06:57,259 --> 00:06:59,618
Lobby's the only point of entry.
Everything else is locked down.

107
00:06:59,743 --> 00:07:02,921
I gotta tell you, I ain't big on taking
this place in broad daylight, on the fly.

108
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,848
What you mean you
ain't big on taking...

109
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:06,759
You just want to throw Parker
under the bus?

110
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,886
- I didn't say that.
- You are saying just walk.

111
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,034
I'm saying,
"What happened to having a damn plan?"

112
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:12,299
Guys, listen.

113
00:07:12,424 --> 00:07:15,636
If you're gonna do a job like this,
you'd need a base camp, right?

114
00:07:15,761 --> 00:07:17,644
Something kind of private
with good visibility?

115
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,397
- And a partner.
- Exactly. You'd want a partner.

116
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,366
But all the shots
from Parker's place,

117
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:25,194
they were taken from a single
location up high.

118
00:07:25,784 --> 00:07:28,530
It's the south side. Look at the way
the sun's going off the windows there.

119
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,448
- According to this height...
- Wait.

120
00:07:31,972 --> 00:07:33,147
"On" The building.

121
00:07:33,747 --> 00:07:37,254
He said "On the building
across the street." Not "In."

122
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:38,875
Eliot, come with me.

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,960
Sophie, walk Hardison into Wakefield so
you can get your hands on the Steranko.

124
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,882
- That's the plan?
- It's all I got.

125
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:46,125
Nate, I keep telling you, this...

126
00:07:46,832 --> 00:07:48,342
Fine. Whatever. Forget it.

127
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:52,054
It's fine. We can do this.
Parker's gonna be okay.

128
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,640
Yeah, I know.
Quiet and sneaky... standard.

129
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,630
Quiet and sneaky is fine
if you're thinking like a thief.

130
00:07:57,755 --> 00:08:00,349
Thieves find entrances,
but grifters?

131
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,469
We make them.

132
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:07,971
This thing was supposed
to be foolproof.

133
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:10,197
This intruder made it
all the way up to my laboratories

134
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:11,601
before he tripped an alarm.

135
00:08:11,726 --> 00:08:13,951
Mr. Rushing and Dr. Hannity, please.

136
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,537
The Steranko has got
the intruder trapped here

137
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,762
between the 25th and the 40th floor
in the biotech levels.

138
00:08:19,887 --> 00:08:22,417
Now, if I can lock
the entire building down...

139
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:26,089
This company is bleeding red ink.
We're being audited every week.

140
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,632
I have bankers calling me from
countries I've never even heard of.

141
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,685
Do you know what'll happen
to our stock prices

142
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,822
if there is even
a rumor of a break-in?

143
00:08:34,685 --> 00:08:35,513
Great.

144
00:08:35,638 --> 00:08:38,299
I've got two more
from the London office downstairs.

145
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:43,224
Get this done, Vorhees.
Quietly. No alarms, no panic...

146
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:47,123
- Not while these auditors are here.
- I can have my men go floor to floor.

147
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:49,158
Match retinal scans with ID badges.

148
00:08:49,283 --> 00:08:50,902
Once a floor is clear,

149
00:08:51,027 --> 00:08:53,288
we lock it down.
There is no way out.

150
00:08:53,619 --> 00:08:54,950
How long will it take?

151
00:08:57,951 --> 00:08:59,682
- 50 minutes.
- Do it.

152
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,250
Quietly.

153
00:09:03,112 --> 00:09:05,196
It's all under control, Dr. Hannity.

154
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:13,118
Why is this happening
today of all days?

155
00:09:13,243 --> 00:09:15,863
The board promised to give me
a fair warning. This is not fair.

156
00:09:16,343 --> 00:09:17,806
Hello! Charles Rushing.

157
00:09:18,293 --> 00:09:21,323
Emily Peal,
J & I resource consultants.

158
00:09:21,448 --> 00:09:24,188
Jonathan Steed,
financial review analyst.

159
00:09:24,596 --> 00:09:27,199
We're here to see
who gets fired today.

160
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,704
It's got to be the right roof.

161
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:41,213
You got a clear line of sight
to the Wakefield tower.

162
00:09:41,338 --> 00:09:44,254
- Good place to supervise a heist.
- Nobody can get past us...

163
00:09:46,935 --> 00:09:47,961
Lisbon.

164
00:09:48,471 --> 00:09:49,940
I think Florence.

165
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:52,132
You know this guy.

166
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,886
Mr. Ford and I once moved
in similar spheres. It was Majorca.

167
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:58,222
Right. White doves.

168
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:03,352
I'd like you to meet Archie Leech,
the world's greatest thief.

169
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,471
Don't move!

170
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,492
You're pretty spry for a dead guy.

171
00:10:22,828 --> 00:10:24,915
You mean the car crash in Paris?
Nobody fell for that.

172
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:29,077
What color is that hat
of yours these days, white or black?

173
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:30,752
Come on, boy.

174
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,381
Pardon me, sir!

175
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,051
Well... Nice.

176
00:10:39,077 --> 00:10:40,660
What's those guys weren't with you?

177
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:42,096
Don't be ridiculous.

178
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,028
They're here to make sure
I get the job done. I'm their hostage.

179
00:10:45,153 --> 00:10:47,434
Barely got away from them
long enough to call you.

180
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,481
Parker's your partner.

181
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:51,942
Parker is rescuing me.

182
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,777
Why would she rescue you?

183
00:10:54,484 --> 00:10:56,154
Because I'm her father.

184
00:11:05,284 --> 00:11:06,081
Yes.

185
00:11:06,454 --> 00:11:08,208
This will do nicely. Now...

186
00:11:08,928 --> 00:11:10,971
I'm gonna need all
your senior executives

187
00:11:11,096 --> 00:11:12,962
and heads of departments
in five minutes.

188
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:15,794
Mr. Steed here is gonna
need computer access,

189
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,535
somewhere private, where he can take
an endoscopic look at all your records.

190
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,972
Is that really necessary?
There's a certain order...

191
00:11:22,346 --> 00:11:24,551
This company is on the brink.
It is hemorrhaging money.

192
00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:27,297
Now, someone will be blamed.

193
00:11:27,422 --> 00:11:29,502
Now, I can either
be your white knight

194
00:11:29,627 --> 00:11:31,940
or the angel of death, your choice.

195
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:37,955
Yes, of course.
Anything to help, miss Peal.

196
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,187
Anything at all.

197
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,826
Get Mr. Steed any office he wants.

198
00:11:49,566 --> 00:11:50,566
Good.

199
00:11:51,037 --> 00:11:52,702
Of course, I'm not her real father.

200
00:11:53,091 --> 00:11:54,756
New York City, 12 years ago.

201
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,631
The little scamp lifted my wallet.

202
00:11:57,134 --> 00:12:00,552
When I first met her, she was wild,
dangerous to herself and to others.

203
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:01,918
But...

204
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,555
she had the gift.

205
00:12:29,307 --> 00:12:31,123
I made her, honed her...

206
00:12:32,031 --> 00:12:33,545
My perfect thief.

207
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,142
She was your legacy.

208
00:12:36,267 --> 00:12:37,273
Just so.

209
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,365
I taught her everything I know
and unleashed her on the world.

210
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,561
You know, she was broken.
You understand that?

211
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:45,055
Parker was broken...
You should have taken her in...

212
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:47,317
What? Taken her home
like a real daughter?

213
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:53,933
This is my wife, Marilyn.

214
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,468
My grandsons.

215
00:12:55,987 --> 00:12:57,219
I love them dearly.

216
00:12:58,581 --> 00:13:00,138
They think I'm an accountant.

217
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,114
What was I supposed to do?

218
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:04,831
You know Parker.
You know she wouldn't fit in.

219
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:06,537
God, she doesn't fit in anywhere.

220
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,912
Yeah, but she was good enough
to send into a deathtrap.

221
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:11,252
I didn't send her anywhere.

222
00:13:12,031 --> 00:13:13,273
I was retired.

223
00:13:13,398 --> 00:13:15,168
They found me, whoever they are.

224
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:18,689
Told me to break into Wakefield and
steal some canister from the labs there

225
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:21,024
Or they would kill my family.

226
00:13:21,456 --> 00:13:22,551
My grandchildren.

227
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,761
You couldn't beat a
Steranko even in your prime.

228
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,035
Which I'm long past.
Thanks for the reminder.

229
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,392
But my employer gave
me these blueprints

230
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,520
And most of the codes. So I thought
I could break the bloody thing!

231
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,684
I called Parker for
help, just to plan.

232
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,399
Next thing I know,

233
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,985
She jumps the gun
and goes in herself.

234
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:42,515
No idea what she was thinking.

235
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,245
I need you to get in position.

236
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,034
When Hardison finds a door, I'm
counting on you to get her through it.

237
00:13:49,564 --> 00:13:51,079
Okay, Hardison, are we on yet?

238
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,956
On and cracking.

239
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,661
I'm in the main company system.

240
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:57,975
Put this in your ear. Ah.

241
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,963
Now, you get that back to me.

242
00:14:00,677 --> 00:14:02,507
I'm downloading all files...

243
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:03,925
Now.

244
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:05,969
Okay, and what about the Steranko?

245
00:14:06,406 --> 00:14:08,590
All the alarm systems are
run through shielded cable,

246
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,807
Which means I can't
hack it through wi-fi.

247
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:13,218
But if you find the actual cable...

248
00:14:23,186 --> 00:14:24,699
Okay. All right.

249
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:27,061
All right.

250
00:14:27,828 --> 00:14:30,148
I'm in. Don't know how far, though.

251
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,802
Get what you can and fast.

252
00:14:35,034 --> 00:14:36,291
What are we doing here?

253
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,043
<i>We want to create some chaos.</i>

254
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:41,463
Get them to focus on you, on each other,
but just get them off Hardison's back.

255
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,758
I know what I'm doing here.

256
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:48,656
Someone has to cut $90 million
of putrid dead weight

257
00:14:48,781 --> 00:14:50,199
from this flabby company.

258
00:14:50,324 --> 00:14:52,807
And that putrid dead
weight is you all.

259
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,569
Now, see here, miss peal.
There's no call for rudeness.

260
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,771
Wakefield agriculture is teetering.

261
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:00,899
I know it. Your board knows it.
Your shareholders know it.

262
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,470
The only people that don't seem to know
it are here in this room, which is why...

263
00:15:04,595 --> 00:15:06,404
you are all fired.

264
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,572
It's happening. They're laying
everybody off right now.

265
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:12,577
You're just a consultant.

266
00:15:13,582 --> 00:15:15,606
You don't have the
authority to fire us.

267
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:18,322
I think you'll find that I do...

268
00:15:19,114 --> 00:15:20,502
Dr. Hannity.

269
00:15:20,915 --> 00:15:21,903
Silver lining...

270
00:15:22,028 --> 00:15:24,327
Anyone that can convince
me, right here, right now,

271
00:15:24,452 --> 00:15:27,050
That their job is
necessary will be rehired.

272
00:15:30,757 --> 00:15:33,390
<i>Just... Well, one at a time.
I... What?</i>

273
00:15:36,262 --> 00:15:37,642
Okay, guys...

274
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,689
I got bad news and not-so-bad news.

275
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,900
The not-so-bad news is that steranko's
only running at a level one.

276
00:15:44,284 --> 00:15:45,581
How many levels are there?

277
00:15:45,962 --> 00:15:47,952
Okay, level one, passive lockdown.

278
00:15:48,077 --> 00:15:49,993
Two, fire. Three,
terrorist takeover.

279
00:15:50,118 --> 00:15:52,138
And four, hazmat containment breach.

280
00:15:52,263 --> 00:15:54,024
Now, if it stays at a level one,

281
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:56,376
She just needs to stay
away from doors, cameras,

282
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,762
Security key cards,
even actual security guards,

283
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:01,418
and she'll be cool for a while.

284
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:04,588
So she's safe as long as she stays
in, but if she tries to get out

285
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:06,391
Boom. Game over.

286
00:16:06,962 --> 00:16:08,294
And that's the bad news.

287
00:16:08,904 --> 00:16:11,761
It's a lobster trap. It's easy to get in,
but there's no way out.

288
00:16:12,242 --> 00:16:13,722
And this helps me how?

289
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:15,348
And what about the perimeter?

290
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:18,240
Perimeter's locked down tight.
It's a solid grid. Right?

291
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:20,749
You got sensors.
You got cameras on everything.

292
00:16:23,344 --> 00:16:26,388
You want to make a bet these suits
don't like giving up their privacy?

293
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:30,864
You're gonna find a blank
on one of these offices.

294
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:32,532
That's actually not... Bad.

295
00:16:32,936 --> 00:16:34,618
All right, guys. So it's a party.

296
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:37,400
But before we rescue Parker,

297
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:40,064
We got to find out where she is.

298
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,936
You do realize the entire
building is looking for Parker.

299
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:46,839
I mean, the actual, physical
building is looking for her.

300
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,466
Look, any cameras that I piggyback,
any sensors that I access,

301
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,533
Anything I do to find Parker

302
00:16:51,658 --> 00:16:53,627
Could lead the bad
guys right to her.

303
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:56,649
What's... what's my play?

304
00:16:56,774 --> 00:16:59,783
Nate, I'm hacking a security system
that the pentagon calls "Overkill"

305
00:16:59,908 --> 00:17:01,785
With a laptop I found
in the back of my car!

306
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,313
Look, man, honest answer...

307
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:06,424
We can't find Parker. We have
to wait for her to send up a signal

308
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:08,735
and hopefully, we get to her first.

309
00:17:24,905 --> 00:17:26,072
Laser tripwires.

310
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,645
In a ventilation shaft?!

311
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:34,266
I'm in trouble.

312
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:53,680
- Your name and the floor you work on.
- Dr. Enzen, 4.

313
00:17:56,022 --> 00:17:57,228
Look up here, please.

314
00:18:00,774 --> 00:18:01,788
Thank you.

315
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,209
Okay. You're clear.

316
00:18:06,936 --> 00:18:08,255
She's clear. She can go.

317
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:36,531
Speak.

318
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,992
Hardison, listen. I screwed up.
I'm downtown in a building...

319
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,370
- We are already here, mama.
- You are? All of you?

320
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:45,331
Wait. Parker, are you calling
me from a company landline?

321
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,751
Yeah. But it's okay,
'cause I have an ID.

322
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,554
No, no. Not okay.

323
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,781
Parker, they are matching
Ids to retinal scans.

324
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:54,746
If a security guard scans
your ID, you're busted.

325
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:57,635
And now that you're calling me,
Steranko knows exactly where you are.

326
00:18:58,202 --> 00:19:00,263
What?! Why?! Make it stop!

327
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:03,132
I don't know. Okay. You got a 30-second
window. Right now you're at 20.

328
00:19:03,257 --> 00:19:07,046
You need to hang up. Get to
cubicle 27. Wait there. Go now.

329
00:19:09,057 --> 00:19:10,159
You find something?

330
00:19:10,284 --> 00:19:12,262
Guys, what would you
say if I told you

331
00:19:12,387 --> 00:19:16,391
That all of mr. Leech's schematics are
watermarked with the Wakefield logo?

332
00:19:17,576 --> 00:19:19,465
Sounds like original documents.

333
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,534
Probably from the company's
hard-copy files.

334
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:24,996
The kind of files that are restricted
to high-level company personnel.

335
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,414
Head of security or above.

336
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,541
Okay, Sophie, I need
you to do me a favor.

337
00:19:28,949 --> 00:19:29,949
Anything.

338
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,546
It's not as if there's
anything going on where I am.

339
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,578
I want you to take a
look around the room.

340
00:19:35,703 --> 00:19:39,353
I mean, really take a good look.
Anything standing out to you?

341
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,890
What are we gonna do? Look...

342
00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:49,512
I can't do this.

343
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,903
Dr. Hannity is awfully calm.

344
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,452
"Dr. Anne Hannity."

345
00:20:04,948 --> 00:20:08,289
She's the senior vice president
in charge of the R&D department.

346
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,967
<i>She runs the biotech division.</i>

347
00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:11,978
Yeah, and she has
access to the steranko

348
00:20:12,103 --> 00:20:15,503
And the vault that Parker's hitting
on the biotech level.

349
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,964
Let me ask you something you ever have
contact with a client face-to-face?

350
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:21,430
The client insisted
on complete discretion.

351
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,888
She's in on it!
Why didn't I see it before?

352
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,098
All right, Archie.

353
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,225
Ford, an inside job like
this only works if...

354
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,041
If they've tied up loose ends. Yes.

355
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,398
If they find Parker, they're
not gonna arrest her.

356
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:32,890
They'll kill her!

357
00:20:40,796 --> 00:20:42,700
- Archie, wait. Slow down.
- We got to warn her.

358
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:45,105
- They're gonna kill her.
- I got my people on it. All right?

359
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,094
<i>Talk to me. Where's Parker?</i>

360
00:20:48,823 --> 00:20:50,081
<i>I already took care of it.</i>

361
00:20:57,532 --> 00:20:58,532
Thank you.

362
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:03,011
Earbud's going hot

363
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,345
in 5...

364
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,052
4...

365
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:08,396
3...

366
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:09,670
2...

367
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:11,964
1.

368
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:23,573
I got it. I'm on. Come get me.

369
00:21:24,857 --> 00:21:25,899
Is Archie there?

370
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:28,453
Archie. Are you okay?

371
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,039
- Yeah. Right as rain, kiddo.
- "Kiddo"?

372
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,334
I couldn't get the canister.
The transcription codes...

373
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,835
Parker, what the hell were
you thinking, going in there?

374
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,734
They would've caught you, Archie.

375
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:39,842
They would've hurt
you or your family.

376
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:42,638
Your real family.

377
00:21:44,018 --> 00:21:45,595
I couldn't let that happen.

378
00:21:48,888 --> 00:21:50,767
It's all right.
Just stay focused.

379
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:51,794
Yes, sir.

380
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:53,561
"Sir"?

381
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,690
Kiddo, I want you to stand up and have
a look around. Tell me what you see.

382
00:21:59,687 --> 00:22:01,488
A bunch of people stealing stuff...

383
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,032
Staplers, paper...

384
00:22:03,157 --> 00:22:04,530
They're pretty bad at it.

385
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:06,074
Thank god.

386
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:08,576
I was dying.

387
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:12,411
- Who is he? Who are you?
- It's me.

388
00:22:12,907 --> 00:22:13,623
Me?

389
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,614
Marketing. Cubicle 135.

390
00:22:17,068 --> 00:22:18,336
Cubicle 27.

391
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,277
I know we said we'd just keep sexting
each other and keep it all online,

392
00:22:23,402 --> 00:22:25,616
but with these layoffs coming,
I just had to see you!

393
00:22:25,741 --> 00:22:26,998
You're hot!

394
00:22:27,963 --> 00:22:28,783
Let's go.

395
00:22:28,908 --> 00:22:31,386
I'm... gee, is it time
for shelly's severance party?

396
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:33,493
Come get me. Come get me.
Come get me!

397
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:34,894
<i>We're on it. Hang tight.</i>

398
00:22:35,752 --> 00:22:37,313
- Your young man.
- Hardison.

399
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,489
Have you got a way
out for our girl yet?

400
00:22:40,614 --> 00:22:42,466
- You don't mind if I...
- No. Go. Go ahead.

401
00:22:42,591 --> 00:22:44,817
I have a hole in the grid
on the 38th floor.

402
00:22:44,942 --> 00:22:48,103
CEO's office.
No cameras, no sensors of any kind.

403
00:22:48,608 --> 00:22:50,076
Eliot, that was a nice call, man.

404
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,937
All right. Rushing
wants his privacy.

405
00:22:52,062 --> 00:22:53,913
- Eliot, you're on.
- <i>Wait a second.</i>

406
00:22:54,198 --> 00:22:56,741
You want me to climb
a 40-story building

407
00:22:56,866 --> 00:22:59,760
<i>Yes. And I want you to do it now.
We're up against the clock.</i>

408
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:12,432
Dr. Hannity, you've been a bad girl.

409
00:23:12,816 --> 00:23:15,921
Nate, Hannity blew through
$60 million last year

410
00:23:16,046 --> 00:23:17,854
and didn't make Wakefield a dime.

411
00:23:18,156 --> 00:23:21,024
Some kind of super
wheat that nobody wants.

412
00:23:21,376 --> 00:23:23,902
She should be on the front
line, begging to keep her job.

413
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,347
I swear. I'd fire her.

414
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:27,452
Hannity is our inside man.

415
00:23:28,304 --> 00:23:30,775
Sophie, you can let
everybody go except Hannity,

416
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,994
and I want her angry.
I mean steamed.

417
00:23:38,144 --> 00:23:40,626
Let's take a look on your resume,
shall we, Dr. Hannity?

418
00:23:43,733 --> 00:23:44,922
Dear.

419
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:46,761
It's a bit thin, isn't it?

420
00:23:46,886 --> 00:23:49,244
PhD in agronomy from Stanford.

421
00:23:49,648 --> 00:23:51,304
MBA from Harvard.

422
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:53,892
Dear.

423
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:56,862
Graduated middle of
your class at both.

424
00:23:57,431 --> 00:23:59,395
Published just... Here and there.

425
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:03,201
I'm vice president of
a fortune 500 company.

426
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:04,776
I'm head of research.

427
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,970
I know. It's surprising, isn't it?

428
00:24:07,095 --> 00:24:09,700
And with such weak credentials.

429
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:14,285
I make one call, and you
are finished, miss Peal.

430
00:24:14,832 --> 00:24:16,312
Let's both make calls.

431
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:20,261
You whine to your CEO
about my bad manners,

432
00:24:20,386 --> 00:24:21,834
and I'll remind the board

433
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,887
that your division has spent
$60 million developing...

434
00:24:25,012 --> 00:24:26,112
What was it?

435
00:24:27,459 --> 00:24:28,257
Wheat.

436
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:30,368
"Wheat"?

437
00:24:33,146 --> 00:24:36,307
You're an accountant,
and you're out of your depth.

438
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,351
A bit full of ourselves, aren't we?

439
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:40,963
You want to know what I've spent

440
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:43,136
the last two years working on?

441
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:46,926
Five companies... five...

442
00:24:47,051 --> 00:24:49,529
control all the world's agriculture.

443
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:51,377
Trillions of dollars.

444
00:24:51,502 --> 00:24:53,483
They do it through wheat.

445
00:24:53,608 --> 00:24:57,161
The world's entire food supply
is founded on wheat.

446
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,896
I didn't know that.

447
00:24:59,021 --> 00:25:00,599
Of course you didn't.

448
00:25:00,968 --> 00:25:03,353
Now, do you know what this is?

449
00:25:03,478 --> 00:25:04,816
Of course you don't.

450
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:07,869
This is a blight called Ug99.

451
00:25:07,994 --> 00:25:11,008
It's a variant of the black
stem fungus native to russia.

452
00:25:11,474 --> 00:25:13,823
Modern wheat has no immunity to it.

453
00:25:13,948 --> 00:25:17,802
This is what happens
if Ug99 ever came to america.

454
00:25:17,927 --> 00:25:20,435
The blight kills every wheat field,

455
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:22,520
anywhere it spreads.

456
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:26,023
Half the world's food supply
rotting in the fields.

457
00:25:26,478 --> 00:25:27,589
That's a famine.

458
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,749
It's an opportunity.

459
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:34,074
If Ug99 ever hit,

460
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,643
those five companies that
control the food supply

461
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,452
will spend billions to beat it.

462
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,673
Whoever comes up
with the solution...

463
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:41,998
Will save lives.

464
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,459
will increase market share.

465
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,741
I'm getting Wakefield
ahead of the curve.

466
00:25:47,866 --> 00:25:49,721
My team has bred a strain of wheat

467
00:25:49,846 --> 00:25:52,720
that is totally immune
to the Ug99 blight

468
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:54,365
and all its variants.

469
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,401
This company hired
you to make money,

470
00:25:57,526 --> 00:26:00,028
not "Super wheat" for some famine

471
00:26:00,153 --> 00:26:01,434
that may never happen.

472
00:26:03,502 --> 00:26:06,506
What if we knew, in advance,

473
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:08,785
exactly what strain

474
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,777
of Ug99 would attack
the food supply,

475
00:26:12,061 --> 00:26:13,232
Where it would hit,

476
00:26:13,357 --> 00:26:15,237
and Wakefield agriculture

477
00:26:15,362 --> 00:26:18,075
had the only wheat in the world
to survive it?

478
00:26:19,006 --> 00:26:20,661
You make your calls, miss Peal.

479
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:22,328
And I'll make mine.

480
00:26:22,936 --> 00:26:24,288
Six months from now,

481
00:26:24,413 --> 00:26:26,167
we'll see who's still
looking for work.

482
00:26:31,418 --> 00:26:33,068
I lost her. She's gone.

483
00:26:35,003 --> 00:26:35,972
Are you there?

484
00:26:36,097 --> 00:26:37,386
<i>Okay, just wait.</i>

485
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,304
Are you telling me
this woman paid us

486
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:42,602
- to steal her own wheat?
- Worse. To steal the blight.

487
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:46,616
Now, she develops this super wheat
to go against the Ug99, the blight.

488
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:49,084
How does she do that?
By testing it over and over again

489
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:52,112
Against the blight to test a vaccine,
you need the infection.

490
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:54,426
But she says her wheat's immune.
How does she know that?

491
00:26:54,551 --> 00:26:57,139
Because she's got a big
canister of it in her lab.

492
00:26:57,264 --> 00:26:59,617
That she uses over and over again
to test her little project.

493
00:27:00,046 --> 00:27:02,524
But why steal something
you already own? Why?

494
00:27:02,649 --> 00:27:04,664
Because she wants it to get out.

495
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,131
That is very crazy
and absolutely right.

496
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,537
Nate, I'm sending you all the data
that Hannity has on that project.

497
00:27:12,246 --> 00:27:14,382
I just punched into
the laboratory storage database.

498
00:27:14,829 --> 00:27:16,297
Not only does dr. Frankenstein

499
00:27:16,422 --> 00:27:18,751
have some of that
Ug99 nightmare fungus

500
00:27:18,876 --> 00:27:20,900
stored in a biohazard vault
here at the Wakefield.

501
00:27:21,025 --> 00:27:23,099
But, like you said, she's keeping it

502
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:26,189
in a canister that matches
the schematics that archie was given.

503
00:27:26,314 --> 00:27:28,646
Looks like somebody was trying
to jump-start an outbreak.

504
00:27:30,032 --> 00:27:31,758
This virus,

505
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:34,490
this what-do-you-call-it, gets out
And kills the normal wheat.

506
00:27:34,615 --> 00:27:36,648
That's right.
And famine everywhere.

507
00:27:36,773 --> 00:27:40,318
It's a multibillion-dollar market
ready for Wakefield to dominate.

508
00:27:40,443 --> 00:27:43,160
It's so arcane, brutal.
She'd have to be a monster.

509
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,651
Yes. Yes, she would.

510
00:27:44,776 --> 00:27:47,641
- We got to take her out.
- We have to get Parker out of there.

511
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,537
Got to let me think.

512
00:27:49,662 --> 00:27:53,131
You've got three people trapped in there,
an outside man who can't get in.

513
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:55,673
So what now?
You gonna actually call the police?

514
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:56,932
Leech, just shut up!

515
00:27:57,057 --> 00:27:59,007
While you're dreaming
of your comic book fantasy,

516
00:27:59,132 --> 00:28:01,187
Parker is in there,
waiting for a bullet in the head.

517
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:03,715
- you put her in there.
- And I'm gonna get her out.

518
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,287
Parker. It's Archie.
You've got to leg it.

519
00:28:06,412 --> 00:28:07,862
Run for the front doors now.

520
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:09,636
No, Parker,
you're not going anywhere.

521
00:28:09,761 --> 00:28:11,429
Your friends botched it, Parker.

522
00:28:11,554 --> 00:28:13,919
Just listen to me,
and I'll get you home.

523
00:28:14,044 --> 00:28:16,255
Parker, do not go anywhere
near the entrance.

524
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,446
There's 100 people there.
It's a bottleneck.

525
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:21,879
And this one's from Amy to Jeff.

526
00:28:22,503 --> 00:28:26,503
"Don't sell yourself short.
40 is the new 25."

527
00:28:28,869 --> 00:28:30,090
And that's very true.

528
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:32,971
You're gonna be just fine.

529
00:28:33,096 --> 00:28:35,119
And, finally, last but not least,

530
00:28:35,244 --> 00:28:38,773
from me to a certain
special someone.

531
00:28:42,957 --> 00:28:44,948
"I know this seems like the end,

532
00:28:45,271 --> 00:28:49,052
"But I want you to think
about all the good times

533
00:28:49,177 --> 00:28:52,821
"And always remember
that I have been

534
00:28:53,087 --> 00:28:54,872
"And forever shall be...

535
00:28:56,146 --> 00:28:57,570
Your rocket man."

536
00:28:59,646 --> 00:29:01,062
Somebody tell me what to do.

537
00:29:01,187 --> 00:29:02,482
Yeah, and fast.

538
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:05,131
I got codes to all the doors,
but steranko is rewriting.

539
00:29:05,256 --> 00:29:07,078
The bastard is quick and smart.

540
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:10,114
<i>Your next open door is two cubicles up
and down to the right.</i>

541
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:12,375
You heard the man.
Now, go.

542
00:29:12,765 --> 00:29:13,675
Going.

543
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,053
Come on. Come on.

544
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,556
Do not lock me out.

545
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,712
Cubicle 27. We're on our way.

546
00:29:33,513 --> 00:29:35,933
<i>Good. Now, up the stairs,
down the hall, left.</i>

547
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:37,481
Can't grab <i>me an elevator?</i>

548
00:29:37,606 --> 00:29:39,477
No. Elevators are a kill zone.

549
00:29:39,602 --> 00:29:41,526
Buildings this tall,
nobody uses the stairs,

550
00:29:41,651 --> 00:29:44,615
they're wired for fire safety,
not security. They're the better choice.

551
00:29:45,794 --> 00:29:47,735
You are on the executive floor.

552
00:29:48,223 --> 00:29:51,089
That means less electronic
countermeasures. I can spoof those.

553
00:29:51,214 --> 00:29:53,355
But that also means
more human guards,

554
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,821
which are attached to
retinal scanners and guns.

555
00:29:56,282 --> 00:29:57,795
Homestretch, mama.

556
00:29:58,112 --> 00:30:00,423
I get it. We're here
to get Parker out.

557
00:30:00,803 --> 00:30:02,817
But this hannity woman
is a piece of work.

558
00:30:03,262 --> 00:30:05,499
There must be something we
can do to bring her down.

559
00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:09,134
<i>38th floor.
No sign of the intruder.</i>

560
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:11,907
All right, Parker, you're at the office.
Break left.

561
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,843
One thing at a time. Eliot, she's
coming out hot. Are you in position?

562
00:30:15,027 --> 00:30:17,690
<i>Yeah, I'm in position.
She's the one that...</i>

563
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,817
Never mind. Scratch that.
There she is.

564
00:30:23,247 --> 00:30:24,247
Move away.

565
00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:27,652
Parker, move!

566
00:30:29,652 --> 00:30:30,652
No, I can't.

567
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,500
Parker, move!

568
00:30:37,853 --> 00:30:38,752
No, I can't.

569
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,546
Parker, what are you doing?

570
00:30:40,921 --> 00:30:43,841
This is no time for crazy! All right?
We got to get the hell out of here!

571
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,505
I have to go back!

572
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:47,897
The steranko has a record
of the break-in.

573
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,729
Hannity can walk the blight out
on her own And blame it on me.

574
00:30:51,313 --> 00:30:53,100
She's gonna get away with it.
We need proof.

575
00:30:53,497 --> 00:30:55,686
- What proof?
- I have to go back steal the blight.

576
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,438
This is not what I taught you.

577
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,232
We do not get involved. We get out.

578
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,569
- This is not what we do!
- No, this isn't what you do!

579
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:08,018
Hannity is bad.
She's gonna hurt a lot of people.

580
00:31:09,687 --> 00:31:11,666
You've taught me a lot of things,
but...

581
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:13,569
This is what we do.

582
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:17,606
She's right, Nate.

583
00:31:18,081 --> 00:31:21,212
Somebody better decide something,
'cause Steranko is whipping my ass.

584
00:31:23,576 --> 00:31:25,317
You're not actually
considering this?

585
00:31:25,442 --> 00:31:27,218
Parker, last time you went
to the vault...

586
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,220
No, I couldn't,
but I was alone then.

587
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,414
I'm not alone now. Okay? Hardison,
just clear a path to the vault.

588
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:34,433
I know what I did wrong before.
I can do it!

589
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:40,203
- It's your show.
- <i>Go for it.</i>

590
00:31:48,526 --> 00:31:50,559
Of all the sanctimonious...

591
00:31:50,684 --> 00:31:54,078
She was home free. She was out!
And now you've got her playing hero?

592
00:31:54,429 --> 00:31:56,202
She was right. It's what we do.

593
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,716
What you do.

594
00:31:59,397 --> 00:32:00,499
You've killed her.

595
00:32:01,613 --> 00:32:03,170
That's what you've bloody done.

596
00:32:04,629 --> 00:32:05,714
You've killed her.

597
00:32:11,071 --> 00:32:12,638
Security office, this is Charlie.

598
00:32:12,763 --> 00:32:15,309
I'm on the executive level.
We got the intruder.

599
00:32:16,957 --> 00:32:18,157
Intruder?
Me?

600
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:22,006
I'm just bringing the figures
for the thing up on the...

601
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:24,108
Not working for you?

602
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:36,634
Options.

603
00:32:38,642 --> 00:32:41,292
Stairwell.
Opening the doors... Now.

604
00:32:46,354 --> 00:32:49,550
Damn it, Hardison! What the hell? You're
supposed to keep these guys off of us.

605
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,135
Do you want my job?

606
00:32:51,565 --> 00:32:52,714
You want mine?

607
00:32:56,054 --> 00:32:58,017
You guys need to get
to the biotech level,

608
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,727
'cause Steranko is locking me out.

609
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,875
- Is the wrong way!
- I know what I'm doing.

610
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:06,459
All right, Phil. Thanks.
I owe you one.

611
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,487
Just like you thought. They're fake.
J and l has never even heard of 'em.

612
00:33:10,883 --> 00:33:11,975
I knew it.

613
00:33:13,153 --> 00:33:15,242
This is leech,
pulling a double-cross.

614
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:17,923
I can't reach the other guys
I had sitting on him.

615
00:33:19,577 --> 00:33:20,577
All right.

616
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:22,075
It's fine.

617
00:33:22,421 --> 00:33:23,948
We get steed and peal first.

618
00:33:24,953 --> 00:33:27,713
Keep them on ice
until after we catch the thief.

619
00:33:28,207 --> 00:33:30,272
Then get rid of them all at once.

620
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,940
I'm on it.

621
00:33:34,957 --> 00:33:38,140
I am not trying to rush y'all, but y'all
need to put some pep in your step.

622
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:43,415
- Where's the next open door?
- Biotech floor,

623
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,339
10 floors down
from your last location.

624
00:33:45,464 --> 00:33:47,691
Thanks.
Eliot, how much do you weigh?

625
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,444
Are you kidding me?
Is she kidding me?

626
00:33:51,015 --> 00:33:52,302
I'm really not.

627
00:33:57,186 --> 00:33:58,915
- I ain't riding that thing.
- Fine.

628
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,704
See you on the biotech level.

629
00:34:01,894 --> 00:34:03,742
And bring one of those scanners!

630
00:34:13,766 --> 00:34:16,580
I got you an elevator and an open door
on the vault-level floor,

631
00:34:16,705 --> 00:34:18,972
but now I am officially locked out.

632
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,058
All right.
Get Sophie and get going.

633
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,978
- What about Parker?
- Not your problem.

634
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:26,167
- Get going.
- This is never gonna work.

635
00:34:27,281 --> 00:34:29,346
Not now, leech. I'm on the phone.

636
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:51,479
Damn it!

637
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:54,591
<i>Copy that. We're on our way.</i>

638
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,683
It's you.

639
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:02,148
We should probably exchange
all our numbers, right?

640
00:35:02,894 --> 00:35:03,894
He's okay.

641
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,413
- Who's that guy?
- Boyfriend.

642
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:13,299
This day sucks!

643
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:15,575
What's "Sexting"?

644
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,440
I'm not having this conversation
with you, Parker.

645
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,353
It's a retina scanner.

646
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:27,321
Only way to beat the Steranko...

647
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,144
is with the Steranko.

648
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:38,695
Not an ascii code.

649
00:35:39,863 --> 00:35:41,498
It's a shellcode.

650
00:35:50,357 --> 00:35:52,639
That's great.
You're awesome. Let's go!

651
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,909
That building's completely
locked down.

652
00:36:22,249 --> 00:36:24,431
They're gonna catch her.
And it's all at your door.

653
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:27,738
She was perfect. You ruined her.

654
00:36:27,863 --> 00:36:30,145
- If you'd left her alone...
- I didn't put her in there.

655
00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:34,084
She stayed up there to service you
and your pathetic robin hood fantasy.

656
00:36:34,538 --> 00:36:36,610
I made her unique. What is she now?

657
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:39,863
I have no idea what Parker is now.
I doubt she knows.

658
00:36:41,903 --> 00:36:43,700
You're a thief. You're not a hitter.

659
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,225
You know nothing about me.

660
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:48,306
What I do know is that w'd bo do to
protect her. If you're gonna shoot me,

661
00:36:48,431 --> 00:36:50,079
do it.
I got work to do.

662
00:36:50,941 --> 00:36:53,710
- You're going in after her?
- Always was, leech.

663
00:36:56,087 --> 00:36:58,476
Hazmat suits,
they're using 'em for cover.

664
00:36:58,601 --> 00:37:00,962
We're at alert four.
Aren't the elevators locked down?

665
00:37:01,087 --> 00:37:04,388
Elevator three is still active. Steranko
doesn't have control of that one.

666
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:06,722
This is Leech.

667
00:37:07,057 --> 00:37:08,767
These people are with Leech.

668
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,294
I can't stop the elevators,
but I can activate the call buttons.

669
00:37:11,419 --> 00:37:13,824
- We can catch 'em in the lobby.
- Bring your gun.

670
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:20,876
All right, folks! No need to panic!
Everything's under control!

671
00:37:21,503 --> 00:37:24,284
Just let the hazmat people
do their jobs!

672
00:37:35,938 --> 00:37:37,087
We need to talk.

673
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:45,554
It's safe up here?

674
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,764
The floor has been evacuated.
We're alone.

675
00:37:52,642 --> 00:37:53,604
We had a deal.

676
00:37:54,015 --> 00:37:54,960
We did,

677
00:37:55,085 --> 00:37:56,980
until you breached
our original contract.

678
00:37:57,105 --> 00:37:59,943
After all, you did want to kill me...
And my partner.

679
00:38:00,385 --> 00:38:01,570
Business is business.

680
00:38:01,899 --> 00:38:03,614
Yes. And so the price has gone up.

681
00:38:04,475 --> 00:38:07,075
If you want your property,
you'll now pay double.

682
00:38:07,555 --> 00:38:09,004
I've heard your proposal.

683
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,412
Now here's mine...

684
00:38:11,047 --> 00:38:12,539
I take the blight now.

685
00:38:12,906 --> 00:38:14,541
Mr. Vorhees kills all of you

686
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:18,787
and feeds your bodies
to the very expensive incinerators

687
00:38:18,912 --> 00:38:21,173
- We have in the sub-level.
- And the police outside?

688
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:22,637
They're perfect.

689
00:38:22,972 --> 00:38:25,588
With all those eyes on the break-in,
the hazmat spill...

690
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:28,045
It'll be easy to blame the theft on,
well...

691
00:38:28,477 --> 00:38:29,431
You people.

692
00:38:30,488 --> 00:38:33,061
Six months from now,
when the famines make news,

693
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:36,294
Wakefield will be
the only company with a fix.

694
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,204
So... How do you want it?

695
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:42,555
Straight on, back of the head?
Mr. Vorhees is flexible.

696
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,280
Neither, I think.

697
00:38:46,077 --> 00:38:48,867
- Is that enough for you, young lady?
- That's plenty.

698
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:51,787
Janet Lin, channel 6 news.

699
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:55,290
I'll just need to follow up on
your little conspiracy to commit murder.

700
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:57,745
Any comment, doctor? We're live.

701
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,257
Hardison, can you get the Steranko
to trigger a fake hazmat alarm?

702
00:39:04,598 --> 00:39:08,122
I was just busting my ass
so this thing won't go defcon four.

703
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:12,349
I got you an elevator and an open door
on the vault-level floor,

704
00:39:12,474 --> 00:39:14,935
but now I am officially locked out.

705
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:16,728
Get Sophie and get going.

706
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,830
I don't know what you told
my producer,

707
00:39:18,955 --> 00:39:22,170
but I am not sneaking my crew
inside a hazmat evacuation

708
00:39:22,295 --> 00:39:25,476
just because you say a Wakefield VP
is dirty. Do I look stupid?

709
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:28,092
You look like someone
who would rather have a Pulitzer...

710
00:39:28,217 --> 00:39:29,950
Right? Than a local emmy.

711
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:07,434
All right. You did it.

712
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:11,450
I have no idea how something so slipshod
could have worked,

713
00:40:12,018 --> 00:40:13,077
but it did.

714
00:40:13,974 --> 00:40:14,786
Cheers.

715
00:40:14,911 --> 00:40:17,087
You have no idea
how warm that makes me feel.

716
00:40:17,704 --> 00:40:18,790
No love lost here.

717
00:40:20,247 --> 00:40:21,252
Fair enough.

718
00:40:21,655 --> 00:40:23,125
End it like gentlemen.

719
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:24,880
Works for me.

720
00:40:39,594 --> 00:40:42,016
- You have a top-flight crew.
- They're good.

721
00:40:42,697 --> 00:40:45,609
- A little undisciplined.
- Well, you can work with that.

722
00:40:49,024 --> 00:40:52,157
I know you did this,
because my family was in danger.

723
00:40:53,614 --> 00:40:54,824
For what it's worth...

724
00:40:55,732 --> 00:40:57,830
there are times now when I wish
I had...

725
00:41:07,137 --> 00:41:08,137
It's okay.

726
00:41:09,472 --> 00:41:11,159
I wouldn't fit into a real family.

727
00:41:13,553 --> 00:41:14,904
You didn't need any.

728
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:17,307
You went out and made your home.

729
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,091
My wallet, Parker.

730
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:51,498
You okay?

731
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:54,888
What do you talk about?

732
00:41:55,774 --> 00:41:56,774
You know...

733
00:41:57,947 --> 00:41:58,947
these stuff....
