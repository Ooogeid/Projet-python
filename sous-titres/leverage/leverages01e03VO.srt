00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,600
DAD.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,600
DAD, ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,400
GET THE HOURSE???

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,400
THAT'S TOO LATE.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,800
YEAH.

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,400
Nine deads

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,700
ONE HORSE SURVIVED. Bultimore

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,100
with smoke in his legs

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,400
My family has been training horses since civil war

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,600
NEVER had anything like THIS.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,900
But you didn't own any of those horses, right?

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,500
That's not how it works.

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,100
Trainers raise them and brake them. They don't own them.

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,600
It's rich man's game.

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,800
But i've always dreamed to have my own horses.

20
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,200
so when this wall-street guy came to town

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,000
Mr. Foss, he said that he wanted to start his own horse franchise

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,700
Mr. Ford, he offered me 10% ownership.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,200
Real ownership.

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,100
i took the deal.

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,000
and six months later, the horses aren't running and Foss is liking

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,600
He burded nine horses Nate.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,200
9 of them. To get his investment back.

28
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,700
And he's running round blaming me for the fire.

29
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,600
Bad enough I lost my stable.

30
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,800
No one will never hire me again. I'm non insurable.

31
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,500
yeah.

32
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,500
Well Foss is up for 2 million dollar insurance payout.

33
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:34,501
So we can get you piece

34
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,200
of that money.

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,200
I don't wanna damn Fosse's money.

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,600
wh-i'm sorry, wh-what is it , that you do want.

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,900
Their scream.

38
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,500
In the fire Mr. Ford the horses scream.

39
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,300
Foss only has one horse left alive.

40
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,000
Get Bultimore for me.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,200
I'll take care of him.

42
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,200
That's all I want.

43
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,800
For that son of bitch they never
being in the horse business again.

44
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Nothing more.

45
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,100
YOU CALLED HIM.

46
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,000
WE NEED HIM.

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,100
YEAH, NO, WE DON'T.

48
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,700
I FORGOT HOW MUCH I LIKE
THESE SOUTHERN WELCOMES.

49
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
EIGHT YEARS,

50
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,200
NO PHONE CALLS, NO LETTERS.

51
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,200
YOU DON'T EARN A HOMECOMING PARADE.

52
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,000
HOW'S YOUR HUSBAND, AIMEE?

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,900
GONE.

54
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,800
SEEMS I HAVE A WEAKNESS FOR MEN
WITH ONE FOOT OUT THE DOOR.

55
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,300
EXCUSE ME.

56
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,000
SO WHEN YOU SAID YOU KNEW THE FAMILY,

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,100

58
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,900
KNEW THE FAMILY, HUH?

59
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,500
PLEASE TELL ME YOU
WEREN'T ENGAGED TO HER.

60
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,400
NO.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,200
I-I MAY HAVE GIVEN HER A PROMISE RING, OR...

62
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,100
- A WHAT?
- So that.

63
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,300

00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,600
WELL, THERE'S NO WAY
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS

65
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,100
IF I HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT YOU BEING STUPID

00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,000
I'M NOT INVOLVED.
I'M -- I WANT TO HELP WILLIE.

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,500
DID YOU HEAR THE GUY'S STORY?

73
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,300

74
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,600
STARTED WITH HIGH-STAKES POKER

75
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,000
I THINK I HAVE A FEVER.

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,700
CAN I BE EXCUSED FROM THIS ONE?

77
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,900
OH. COME HERE.
LET ME FEEL YOUR HEAD.

78
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,900
NO, DON'T -- DON'T FEEL HER.

79
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,000
WHY DO YOU -- WHAT -- WHAT'S THE DEAL?

80
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
W-WHAT we --

81
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,500

88
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,900
I JUST REALLY DON'T LIKE HORSES.

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,800
MOVING ON.

90
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
SIX MONTHS AGO,

91
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,100
FOSS POURED A PILE OF CASH INTO BUYING
ALL OF THE HORSES FROM WILLIE'S STABLE.

92

100
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,900

YOUR OLD INSURANCE COMPANY HOLDS
THE POLICY ON FOSS' HORSES.

104
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,000
IS THAT GONNA BE A PROBLEM?

105
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,800
NO, IF I CAN FIND A WAY TO STICK
IT TO MY OLD BOSSES, EVEN BETTER.

106
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,800
OUR MISSION IS TO TAKE

SO, ARE YOU HERE FOR BUSINESS OR PLEASURE?

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,800
YOU IN THE MARKET FOR A HORSE?

135
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,100

136
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,900
I DON'T DEAL WITH SPRINTERS.

137
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,000
NO, NO, NO.

138
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,100
I LIKE MINE TO FINISH THE MILE.

139
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,900
I-I'M SORRY. UM...

140
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,400
I DON'T REALLY RECOGNIZE THE LAST NAME.

141
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,700
WHAT OWNERS HAVE YOU WORKED WITH?

142
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,200
I BROKERED THE DEAL FOR
THE LAST TWO DERBY WINNERS.

143
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,100
IT'S GOOD FOR BUSINESS,

144
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,500

145
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,800
HE'S GOT A $50,000 LIMIT.

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,500
HE BET ON KENTUCKY THUNDER.

147
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,600
IN FACT, ONE OF THE HORSES
RACING TODAY WAS MY SALE.

148
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,000
KENTUCKY THUNDER.

149

THE ONE WHOSE STABLE BURNED DOWN, RIGHT?

178
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,300
YOU'RE THE GUY WHO HAD THE
STABLE BURN DOWN ??

179
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,400
YEAH? WELL, I KNOW YOU'RE
NEW AROUND HERE AND EVERYTHING,

180
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,900
SO WHY DON'T I JUST
GIVE YOU A LITTLE TIP --

181
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,000
DON'T LET YOUR STABLE
BURN DOWN, THERE, BOSS.

182
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,900
BOSSY.

183
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,600
WHY DON'T WE PLAY SOME CARDS?

184
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,800
ACTUALLY, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
HOLD ON ONE SECOND, PLEASE.

185
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
DO YOU MIND IF I, UH...

186
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,600
ANYBODY MIND -- I GOT THIS
OUT OF A GIFT SHOP TODAY --

187
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,700
PLAY WITH A FRESH DECK?

188
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,300
THAT'S A ROOKIE MOVE,
BUT I DON'T MIND.

189
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,800
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

190
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,700
WHY DON'T YOU JUST HAND HER THE
DECK THERE, UH, FOSSIL...

191
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,500
YEAH SURE. FINE ??

192
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,000
SO WE CAN PLAY SOME CARDS,
AND YOU CAN LOSE SOME MONEY.

193
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,200
AHH.

194
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,200
ALL RIGHT.

195
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,100
UH, I'M $40,000 LIGHT.

196
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,400
BUT I'M SURE, UH,
THIS WILL JUST BE WORTH --

197
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,900
WE PLAY FOR CASH
OR WE PLAY FOR HORSES.

198
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,100
NOW, YOU STILL GOT ONE OF THOSE LEFT,

199
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,800
OR DID YOU LOSE THAT ONE, TOO?

200
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,100
CUTE.

201
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,000
ALL RIGHT.

202
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,300
I'M GOING TO PUT IN
MY LAST HORSE -- BALTIMORE.

203
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
WITNESS IT.

204
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
THANKS, DARLING.

205
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,900
SEE? 'CAUSE THAT'S HOW WE DO
IT WHERE I'M FROM, HOSS.

206
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,000
YOU'RE BLUFFING.

207
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,400
THERE'S FOUR 9s.

208
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
GOOD?

209
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,500
DAMN. MM.

210
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,600
"C. U."

211
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,900
YOU'RE A CHEATING SON OF A BITCH!

212
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,400
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

213
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,400
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE SURE
JERSEY BOY HERE GETS MY HORSE,

214
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,600
NUMBER 1, AND YOU --

215
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,300
WELL, YOU CAN COME BACK TO PLAY
WITH US ANYTIME YOU WANT.

216
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,800
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS ISN'T BINDING,

217
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,700
- SO GOOD LUCK.
- OH, IT'S NOT BINDING, HUH?

218
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,600
- NO.
- YOU HAD FOUR 9s,

219
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,800
AND I HAD FOUR JACKS.

220
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,200
FOUR 9s, FOUR JACKS.

221
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,200
FOUR 9... FOUR JACKS, I BELIEVE,
IS BETTER THAN FOUR 9s.

222
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,700
I'LL TELL EVERYBODY FROM VEGAS TO HOUSTON

223
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,600
THAT ALAN FOSS WELCHES ON HIS BETS.

224
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,900
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? I'LL TELL 'EM.

225
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,900
PLEASURE DOING BUSINESS.

226
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,100
I OWE YOU ONE.

227
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,800
THANK YOU.

228
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,600
WE'RE DONE.

229
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,300
HELLO, NATE.

230
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,000
STERLING.

231
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,800
WHY ARE YOU PLAYING POKER
WITH MY CLIENT, NATE?

232
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,900
ALAN FOSS IS YOUR CLIENT. HUH.

233
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,500
THE FIRE, YOU'RE INVESTIGATING
THE STABLE FIRE FOR I.Y.S.,

234
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,700
YOU GOT MY OLD JOB.

235
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,900
ACTUALLY, I HAVE YOUR OLD OFFICE.

236
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,800
VERY ROOMY.

237
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,600
ALLOW ME TO REPHRASE.

238
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,700
WHY IS AN EX-INSURANCE
AGENT PLAYING POKER

239
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,500
WITH THE SUBJECT OF AN OPEN
INSURANCE INVESTIGATION?

240
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,100
OPEN INVESTIGATION?

241
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,500
LOCAL COPS THINK IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

242
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,300
LOCAL COPS DON'T HAVE TO WRITE
A CHECK FOR $2 MILLION.

243
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,000
IT'S MY JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T --

244
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,300
OH, NATE, THAT'S PATHETIC.

245
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,000
THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE
COMPLICATED LITTLE GAMES

246
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,400
THAT YOU LIKE TO PLAY.

247
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,600
ALL RIGHT, SO, YOU'RE HUSTLING FOSS,

248
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,700
TRYING TO PROVE ARSON
OR GET HIM ON FRAUD --

249
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,100
WHATEVER, AS LONG AS THE COMPANY
DOESN'T HAVE TO WRITE THE CHECK.

250
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,600
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET YOUR OLD JOB BACK.

251
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,800
YOU KNOW, OKAY.

252
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,000
YOU HAVE IT ALL FIGURED OUT.

253
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,000
I'LL JUST BACK OFF FROM --
FROM NOW ON.

254
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,000
NO. IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.

255
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,100
TELL YOU THE TRUTH, THOUGH,

256
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,000
I'D KIND OF GIVEN UP ON FOSS.

257
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,200
I LIKE THE TRAINER FOR
THE FIRE -- WILLIE MARTIN.

258
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,500
WILLIE MARTIN'S AN INNOCENT MAN.

259
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,600
WE'RE INSURANCE MEN, NATE.

260
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,400
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT WHO'S GUILTY
OR WHO'S INNOCENT --

261
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,800
JUST WHO PAYS.

262
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,000
STERLING.

263
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,700
SOPHIE DEVEREAUX.

264
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,900
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SINCE...WHAT WAS IT?

265
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,000
THAT LITTLE COUP IN SIERRA LEONE?

266
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,000
THIS IS GETTING VERY INTERESTING.

267
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,500
WE NEED A...

268
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,200
NEW PLAN.

269
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,000
IS IT TRUE STERLING SPENT THREE
DAYS IN THE TRUNK OF A CAR

270
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,100
- WAITING TO CATCH SOMEONE?
- NO. NO.

271
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,500
- IT WAS FIVE.
- WHAT?

272
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,000
LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING THAT HE'S
BETTER THAN YOU WERE BUT --

273
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,200
- "WERE"? I-I'M SORRY.
- WE NEED TO GET WILLIE

274
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,000
THAT HORSE BACK AND GET OUT OF HERE VERY,

275
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
- VERY QUICKLY.
- IT'S A LITTLE TOO LATE FOR THAT.

276
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,300
I MEAN, STERLING THINKS THAT I'M
TRYING TO GET MY JOB BACK, RIGHT?

277
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,600
HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE CLAIM ANYMORE.

278
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,800
HE'S JUST GONNA MESS WITH ANYTHING I DO.

279
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,600
IF I TRY TO KEEP BALTIMORE FOR MYSELF,

280
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,800
HE'S GONNA TRY TO GET
BALTIMORE BACK FOR FOSS.

281
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,800
IF I GIVE WILLIE THE HORSE,
WILLIE BECOMES THE TARGET,

282
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,200
AND BELIVE ME, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE,

283
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,900
- YOU KNOW, THE TARGET OF STERLING.
- ???

284
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,800
GREAT. SO, WAIT, WAIT.

285
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,700
YOU'RE SAYINGWILLIE LOSES THE HORSE
AND FOSS STAYS IN BUSINESS?

286
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,700
- NICE.
- NO, NO, NO. LISTEN.

287
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,500
I THINK I KNOW A WAY
WE CAN TACKLE BOTH -- I THINK.

288
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,100
SOPHIE, TRY TO GET FOSS HERE.

289
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,900
AND YOU GUYS KEEP A TAB ON STERLING.

290
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,400
RUN INTERFERENCE.

291
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,600
ELIOT, FIND US A STABLE.

292
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,900
AIMEE GOT US THE HORSES.

293
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,900
WE NEED HER HELP TO PULL THIS OFF.

294
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,800
SO ALL OF THESE ARE MINE?

295
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,400
UH, WELL, NO.

296
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,200
TRAINERS WORK WITH
A LOT OF DIFFERENT OWNERS,

297
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,000
SO ONLY A FEW OF THEM WILL BE YOURS.

298
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,800
BUT THE STABLES BELONG
TO THE TRAINERS, NOT THE OWNERS.

299
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,700
SO HIS OFFICE WOULD BE RIGHT DOWN THERE.

300
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,800
YOU CAN'T EVEN SAY MY NAME NOW?

301
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,900
NO, SIRREE.

302
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,800
HMM.

303
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,900
UH, AND THE LOGOS?

304
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,100
LIKE SHE SAID --MY STABLE.

305
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,000
THESE STABLES ARE ALL IDENTICAL.

306
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,100
THE ONLY WAY TO TELL THEM
APART IS BY TRAINER LOGOS,

307
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,200
SO HARDISON FAKED A COUPLE
OF THEM UP THIS MORNING.

308
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,300
ANYTHING ELSE SO YOU NEED
SO YOU CAN WRAP THIS UP

309
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,000
AND GO BACK TO BEING A
SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING MEMORY?

310
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,800
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE FINE WITH THIS.

311
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,700
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE
COMING BACK IN A THREE WEEKS.

312
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,400
OH, BOY, THIS IS PERFECT.

313
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,700
WHERE THE HELL IS HE?

314
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,800
INCOMING.

315
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,000
AND...STERLING.

316
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,000
ELECTRONIC LOCKS, ELECTRONIC THROTTLE,

317
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,100
POWER STEERING, KEYLESS ENTRY...

318
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,400
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT RUNS ALL THAT?

319
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,600
COMPUTERS?

320
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,800
OH, YEAH.

321
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,700
HELLO? POLICE?

322
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,900
LISTEN, I'M AT THE RACETRACK.

323
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,200
YEAH, I JUST PASSED A BLACK VAN.

324
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,000
I CAN'T BE SURE,

325
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,600
BUT I THINK I HEARD
SCREAMING FROM INSIDE.

326
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,800
AND THERE AS BLOOD, LIKE,
ALL OVER THE BACK OF THE DOORS.

327
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
SURE, YEAH, THEY COULD HAVE HAD GUNS.

328
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,500
WHO KNOWS?

329
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,200
YEAH, A BLACK VAN.
YEAH, SURE. I'LL HOLD.

330
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,700
HE'S LIKE NATE.

331
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,400
EVIL NATE.

332
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,000
LET'S FLEE NOW, TALK LATER.

333
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,600
I SURE DO APPRECIATE YOU
COMING ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

334
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,900
HOW COULD YOU --

335
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,100
GIBSON.

336
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,900
GIBSON, LISTEN, WE NEED
TO TALK ABOUT MY HORSE.

337
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,800
AND HOW NICE HE LOOKS
IN HIS NEW HOME HERE.

338
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,100
HUH, IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TAL-- WHOA.

339
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,600
YEAH, NOT AS NICEAS YOU, DARLIN'.

340
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,300
GOOD THING THERE'S NOT A RULE
ABOUT SHORT SKIRTS IN HORSE STABLES.

341
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,400
YEAH, LET'S GO TALK.

342
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,800
UH, YOU -- I DON'T REMEMBER YOUR
NAME, BUT I NEED YOUR OFFICE.

343
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,600
- I'm gonna ask...
- NO, TODAY. TODAY.

344
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,200
NOT -- NOT -- NOT --
NOT TOMORROW. TODAY.

345
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,900
ALL RIGHT, GO.

346
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,300
ALL RIGHT, LOOK. MY INSURANCE
GUY'S A REAL PRICK.

347
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,900
HE SAYS UNTIL THE CLAIM CLEARS,

348
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,400
I CAN'T SELL THAT LAST HORSE.

349
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,700
YEAH, WELL, OF COURSE HE DID.

350
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,500
ALL RIGHT,??

351
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,100
UM. I WOULD LIKE TO BUY
BALTIMORE BACK, PLEASE.

352
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,100
OKAY, SO HERE'S $40,000.

353
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,700
NO, THE PRICE WENT UP.
IT'S $2 MILLION.

354
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,900
WHAT -- EX-- SAY WHAT?

355
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,400
I GOT THIS BIG DEAL COMING UP,
DON'T I, DARLIN'?

356
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,000
AND I COULD USE THE LIQUID CASH.

357
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,200
2 MILLION BUCKS.

358
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,000
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIDICULOUS.

359
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,800
YOU'RE A JOKE.

360
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,700
WELL, THAT'S THE WAY WE PLAY
WHERE I COME FROM.

361
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,300
LISTEN. WHY DON'T YOU AND I --

362
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,400
WHY DON'T WE GO TALK ABOUT HOW
MUCH MONEY YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME.

363
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,600
AND YOU -- WHY DON'T YOU
CALL ME WHEN YOU'RE SERIOUS.

364
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,500
COME ON, THERE, KITTY.

365
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,400
OH, YOU'RE JUST GONNA GO WITH --

366
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,200
'CAUSE, YEAH, HE'S -- HE'S --
HE'S A REAL CHARMER.

367
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,100
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

368
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,900
I'M SORRY.

369
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,600
I'VE JUST SEEN THAT LOOK BEFORE.

370
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,900
THAT'S A BOB GIBSON SPECIAL.

371
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,000
WHAT, ARE YOU SERIOUS?! HOW
DO YOU EVEN PUT UP WITH THAT?

372
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,800
HE'S A LITTLE WORSE THIS WEEK
'CAUSE HE'S GOT THIS DEAL,

373
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,900
AND HE, UH...

374
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,200
ANYWAY, I'M SORRY HE DIDN'T
SELL YOU YOUR HORSE BACK.

375
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,500
AND WHAT IS THIS DEAL WITH KITTY?

376
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,900
W--

377
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,300
I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH THAT, MR. FOSS.

378
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,900
SEE, THIS INDUSTRY IS CHANGING.

379
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,300
YEP. WASTED MY TIME
WITH THAT PENNY-ANTE CRAP.

380
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,500
CHEAP HORSES, LOW-RENT TRAINERS, OKAY.

381
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,700
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT I DID, THOUGH?

382
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,200
I CALLED MY HEDGE-FUND BUDDIES UP.

383
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,000
AND WE'RE GONNA FORM
INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS,

384
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,700
ONLY WITH HORSES AND NOT STOCKS.

385
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,100
MODERNIZE THE SPORT
SO GUYS LIKE BOB GIBSON

386
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,700
WON'T KNOW WHAT HIT THEM WHEN
NEW YORK MONEY COMES TO TOWN.

387
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,400
SO YOU DO ME A FAVOR.
HERE'S HOW I CAN HELP YOU.

388
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,000
YOU EITHER JOIN THE REVOLUTION

389
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
OR YOU GET THE HELL OUT OF MY WAY.

390
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,800
SEE YA.

391
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,600
GREAT NEWS.

392
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,600
NOT ONLY IS FOSS NOT
OUT OF THE HORSE BUSINESS,

393
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,800
HE'S BRINGING IN MORE
MONEY AND MORE PARTNERS.

394
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,100
CAUGHT THAT. WORKING ON IT.

395
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,500
YOU'RE WORKING ON IT?
YOU SAID THAT YOU HAD A PLAN.

396
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,100
HE JUST SAID HE'S WORKING ON IT.

397
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,800
RIGHT, BUT YOU CONVINCED MY DAD

398
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,100
THAT THINGS WERE GONNA BE OKAY.

399
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,800
THINGS HAVE ONLY GOTTEN WORSE.

400
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
NOW, I-I APPRECIATE YOU TRYING TO HELP,

401
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,000
BUT IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING, JUST WALK AWAY.

402
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,000
AT LEAST I KNOW YOU'RE GOOD AT THAT.

403
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,400
CAN'T LET IT GO, CAN YOU?
CAN'T LET IT BE THE PAST.

404
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,100
NO, I WAS FINE UNTIL THE LONG-LOST
HERO CAME BACK INTO TOWN.

405
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,200
- YOUR DAD CALLED ME.
- YOU COULD HAVE SAID NO.

406
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,800
WHEN DID I BECOME THE BAD GUY, HUH?

407
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,900
- I LEFT BECAUSE YOU GOT MARRIED.
- OH, YEAH,

408
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,500
AND THE FIRST 15 TIMES YOU LEFT?

409
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,100
I CAME BACK, ALL RIGHT?

410
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,600
- YOU'RE THE ONE THAT MOVED ON.
- NO PHONE CALLS.

411
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,200
NO LETTERS -- NOTHING!

412
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,300
ELIOT, WHAT KIND OF A PERSON DOES THAT?

413
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,500
WHAT -- WHAT REASONABLE
JUSTIFICATION COULD YOU HAVE

414
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,300
FOR JUST DROPPING OFF THE PLANET, HUH?

415
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,100
Tell us what you did with the monkey!

416
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,700
Where is it? Where is the monkey?!

417
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,900
I WAS WORKING.

418
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,500
NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

419
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,000
HEY, JUST LISTEN TO ME JUST FOR A --

420
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,400
- OH, DON'T START WITH YOUR STUFF.
- OH, DON'T.

421
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,600
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF THIS.

422
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,400
STOP.

423
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,500
COME HERE.

424
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,300
WHAT ABOUT THAT THING
YOU DID IN -- IN KAZAKHSTAN?

425
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,000
NO, STERLING KNOWS ABOUT THAT ONE.

426
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,800
AND YOU'RE SURE THIS ISN'T ABOUT
STICKING IT TO YOUR OLD RIVAL?

427
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,000
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

428
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,800
IT'S REALLY NOT WORTH PUTTING
THE REST OF US AT RISK.

429
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,500
NO, LISTEN, YOU KNOW,

430
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,600
STERLING IS GONNA DO
EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER

431
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,300
TO TAKE US DOWN, ALL RIGHT?

432
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,900
AND HE'S GONNA TAKE WILLIE WITH HIM.

433
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,700
SO I-I'M JUST TRYING
TO COME UP WITH SOME PLAN

434
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,500
THAT HE DOESN'T SEE A MILE AWAY

435
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,000
- WITH A BLINDFOLD ON.
- SAME THING WITH A ZEBRA.

436
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,500
- THEY BITE AND THEY NEVER LET GO.
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

437
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,500
- ???IN THE JUNGLE
- HOLD UP. WAIT, WAIT.

438
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,700
WHAT ABOUT MISTER ED?

439
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,600
YEAH, A TALKING ANIMAL
THAT NOBODY ELSE CAN HEAR?

440
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,900
THAT NEVER ENDS BADLY.

441
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,600
IT DIDN'T TURN OUT BADLY.
WILBUR LOVED MISTER ED.

442
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,700
HE LOVED HIM LIKE A
SECOND COUSIN TWICE REMOVED.

443
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,100
THAT'S IT.

444
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,000
THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.

445
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,900
WHAT? A TALKING HORSE?

446
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,200
NO. THE LOST HEIR.

447
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,600
WHAT'S THAT?

448
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,100
CLASSIC EUROPEAN SCAM.

449
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,700
YOU POSE AS A LONG-LOST
DESCENDANT OF THE ROYAL FAMILY.

450
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,400
AND WHEN YOU PULL IT OFF, WELL,
THE PAYOFFS ARE REALLY GOOD --

451
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,200
LOADS OF PARTIES, MONEY,

452
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,300
AND...A FABULOUS FABERGE EGG.

453
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,500
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH HORSES?

454
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,900
WELL, WITH HORSES,
IT'S ALL ABOUT BLOODLINES.

455
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,100
THE LOST HEIR OF THE
ROYAL EQUINE FAMILY...

456
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,800
IS GONNA BE WORTH MILLIONS.

457
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:19,600
WE ARE GONNA SELL THIS GUY THE
GREATEST HORSE THAT NEVER LIVED.

458
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,900
GO AHEAD. I KNOW YOU'RE
ITCHING TO SAY SOMETHING.

459
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,100
I LIKE AIMEE.

460
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,000
I DO. I MEAN IT. I LIKE YOU BOTH.

461
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,900
I JUST -- YOU KNOW,

462
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,900
I DON'T KNOW WHAT COMES OF
CHASING THE PAST, YOU KNOW, ELIOT?

463
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,300
YEAH, WELL, SOPHIE, SWEETIE,

464
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,100
I DON'T THINK YOU AND NATE GET
TO SERVE ME THAT PARTICULAR MEAL.

465
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,500
OUCH.

466
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,900
WE'RE USING BALTIMORE AS THE LOST HEIR.

467
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,800
I HACKED INTO THE IFHA WEBSITE.

468
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,000
THAT'S THE DATABASE WITH
ALL THE HORSES' BLOODLINES.

469
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
NOW, ALL THAT INFORMATION
IS LINKED ON NUMBERS

470
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,900
TO MICROCHIPS IN THE HORSE'S NECK.

471
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,300
NOW, WE'LL LINK
BALTIMORE'S MICROCHIP NUMBER

472
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,300
TO A FAKE HORSE WITH A GREAT BLOODLINE.

473
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,100
THEN WE'LL DISGUISE THE
WHITE STRIPE ON HIS FACE

474
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,400
- WITH SOME PAINT.
- NO, NO. IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

475
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,200
HIS LUNGS ARE STILL
MESSED UP FROM THE FIRE.

476
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,600
WELL, HE CAN STILL RUN.

477
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,100
HE CAN RUN, BUT FOSS
IS GONNA SEE HOW SLOW HE IS.

478
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,700
THAT PAINT THING --
THAT'S NOT GONNA HOLD UP

479
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,100
IF HE GETS CLOSE ENOUGH TO SCAN THE CHIP.

480
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,200
UH...

481
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,400
AHH.

482
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,600
WELL, WE NEED TO FIND A HORSE
THAT CAN RUN LIKE A CHAMPION.

483
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,700
WHAT ABOUT THAT HORSE FROM THE OTHER DAY?

484
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,200
KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN?

485
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
KENTUCKY THUNDER?

486
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,500
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

487
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,100
OH, WE STEAL AN ACTUAL
CHAMPIONSHIP RACEHORSE

488
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,700
IN ORDER TO FAKE ANOTHER
CHAMPIONSHIP RACEHORSE.

489
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,800
OOH, I LIKE IT.

490
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,600
WHOO-HOO, TODD? LINA WATTERS.

491
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,800
TODD HAZEN, RIGHT?
KENTUCKY THUNDER'S TRAINER?

492
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,200
YES. CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING?

493
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,600
GREAT. WELL, WE'RE ALL SET.

494
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,300
SET?

495
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,300
WELL, YOU ARE READY FOR
THE INTERVIEW, AREN'T YOU?

496
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,400
EXCUSE ME?

497
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,100
WELL, MY OFFICE HAS
BEEN CALLING YOU ALL DAY.

498
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,000
I'VE SET UP AN INTERVIEW
WITH SPORTS ILLUSTRATED.

499
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,200
A COUPLE YEARS AGO,

500
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,500
ALL THE CELLPHONE COMPANIES WENT
DIGITAL WITH THEIR VOICEMAIL SYSTEMS.

501
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,900
MAN, IT WAS LIKE SOMEBODY PUT A
BRAND-NEW SWING SET ON MY PLAYGROUND.

502
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,300
DAMN IT.

503
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,100
LIKE I SAID, BEEN CALLING YOU ALL DAY.

504
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,400
I HEARD YOU, MA'AM.

505
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,800
SO, LISTEN, THE REPORTER'S GONNA
BE AT THE TURF CLUB ANY SECOND NOW.

506
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,700
I HEAR YOU.

507
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,700
THANK YOU.

508
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,000
UM, LISTEN, IF HE'S NOT THERE,
PLEASE WAIT FOR HIM FOR HALF AN HOUR.

509
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
MAYBE AN HOUR...OR TWO.

510
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,200
HAVE A SNACK.

511
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,300
Good afternoon.

512
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,600
ANY SIGN OF STERLING?

513
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,800
NO. ALL CLEAR.

514
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,700
PARKER?

515
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,300
NOPE.

516
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,300
WHAT ABOUT THESE GUYS?
ANY TROUBLE GETTING THEM HERE?

517
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,800
Airport- Earlier that Day.

518
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,100
WELL, THE LITTLE ONE HAS
A BLADDER THE SIZE OF PEANUT.

519
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,300
SHE HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM
THREE TIMES ON THE WAY HERE

520
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,800
AND ONCE WHEN WE GOT HERE.

521
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,600
YOU EVER HEAR OF THE BEIJING JOCKEY CLUB?

522
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,100
YEAH, FLEW OUT THERE A FEW YEARS
BACK WITH A COUPLE OF BUDDIES.

523
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,700
WE MET WITH THE FOUNDER, J.P. CHANG.

524
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,700
HE, UH, WAS TRYING TO START
THIS HORSE HEDGE FUND.

525
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
- RIGHT IDEA, WRONG INVESTMENT.
- YEP. IMPORTED 600 HORSES.

526
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,400
ALL THE BEST BLOODLINES IN THE WORLD.

527
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,200
YEAH, FOR ALL THE GOOD THAT DID THEM.

528
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,000
COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT
CRACKS DOWN A YEAR LATER,

529
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,600
KILLS EVERY SINGLE HORSE.

530
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,500
600 THOROUGHBRED RACEHORSES DEAD,

531
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,900
AND NOBODY MAKES ONE CENT
ON THE INSURANCE PAYOUTS.

532
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,700
THAT IS THE REAL TRAGEDY, MY FRIEND.

533
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,100
THEY DIDN'T KILL 600 HORSES.

534
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,100
THEY KILLED 599.

535
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,600
WHAT?

536
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,600
THAT'S THE SURVIVING HORSE.

537
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,200
Come on.

538
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,100
THAT TIME BEATS EVERY DERBY
WINNER IN THE LAST DECADE.

539
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,300
HIS NAME'S FEI KUAI,
BORN SEPTEMBER 15th.

540
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,900
THAT'S A MONTH BEFORE
THE OTHERS WERE KILLED.

541
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,000
THOSE ARE THE ORIGINAL OWNERS.

542
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,100
THEY'RE TRYING TO UNLOAD HIM
BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT FINDS HIM.

543
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,600
WAIT, ARE THEY TRYING
TO SELL IT TO GIBSON?

544
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,600
FOR A FRACTION OF WHAT HE'S WORTH.

545
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,200
NO, NO WAY. NOT HAPPENING.

546
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,700
CAN YOU GET INTERNET
ON YOUR PHONE, MR. FOSS?

547
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,500
YES.

548
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,600
PULL UP THE IFHA WEBSITE.
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

549
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,800
EVERY THOROUGHBRED WORLDWIDE HAS
THEIR BLOODLINES REGISTERED THERE.

550
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,400
PUNCH IN THAT NUMBER RIGHT THERE.

551
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,800
THAT'LL GIVE YOU THE
BLOODLINES OF THIS HORSE.

552
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,300
8-9-9-3-3.

553
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,800
NATIVE DANCER, WAR ADMIRAL, SECRETARIAT.

554
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,500
YOU GOT TO BE --
THIS HORSE IS A KENNEDY.

555
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,100
YEAH, IF YOU'RE GONNA START
A FRANCHISE, MR. FOSS,

556
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,600
THIS IS THE HORSE YOU NEED.

557
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,800
WHAT DID WE FIND OUT
ABOUT HIS INVESTMENT GROUP?

558
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,100
SIX INVESTORS.

559
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,400
THEY EACH MATCHED FOSS'
$2 MILLION SEED MONEY.

560
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,900
THEY PUT FOSS IN CHARGE.

561
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,700
ALL RIGHT, SOPHIE, GET IN THERE.

562
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,300
HE'S GOT $12 MILLION
WITH YOUR NAME ON IT.

563
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,100
MR. FOSS, HOW NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

564
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,600
- BRAD.
- MISS KATHERINE.

565
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,600
PARDON US, BUT WE NEED TO GET
THIS HORSE BACK TO HIS STABLE NOW.

566
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,000
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, KITTY CAT.
I WANT TO BUY YOUR HORSE.

567
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,100
WHATEVER GIBSON OFFERED YOU,
I WANT TO GIVE YOU MORE.

568
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,400
I'M SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU,

569
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,100
BUT MR. GIBSON OFFERED THEM $11 MILLION.

570
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,300
GREAT. $12 MILLION BY TOMORROW.

571
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,400
This nice man also welcomes you. He likes your shirt.
Do you remember where you bought it?

572
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,800
I think it was a gift.

573
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,400
IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY BY
TOMORROW, THE HORSE IS YOURS.

574
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,900
YES! SLAP IT. SLAP IT.

575
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,200
OF COURSE.

576
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
IN THE CHINESE CULTURE,

577
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,100
IT IS CUSTOMARY TO TAKE A PICTURE
TOGETHER WHEN YOU TRANSFER A PROPERTY.

578
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,100
WHAT ARE YOU KID-- HELL, YEAH.
COME ON. LET'S DO IT RIGHT NOW.

579
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:16,800
TAKE IT.

580
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,200
LET'S DO IT.

581
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
SMILE.

582
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,300
YOU GOT TO GO AGAIN?

583
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,900
OF COURSE YOU DO.

584
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,200
IT'S RIGHT ON IN THERE,
RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER.

585
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,900
- GO ON. GO ON AHEAD.
- ok???

586
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,300
Hello. I have your camera.

587
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,700
Did you get some nice pictures?

588
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,100
I think so.

589
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,000
I have to go.

590
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,000
YOU KNOW, I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT AT FIRST.

591
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
STERLING, WELCOME.

592
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,800
BUT, THEN AGAIN, YOU DID DRINK
YOURSELF RIGHT OUT OF A JOB.

593
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,200
LOST YOUR HOUSE, YOUR WIFE.

594
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,800
PLENTY OF MONEY TROUBLES.

595
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,600
KEEP TALKING.

596
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,400
YOU'LL GET TO THE POINT EVENTUALLY.

597
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,500
YOU CROSSED THE LINE.

598
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,900
NATHAN FORD IS A COMMON CRIMINAL.

599
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,200
OH. "COMMON"?

600
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,100
WELL, THAT'S JUST HURTFUL.

601
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,600
I SPOKE TO MY CLIENT TONIGHT.

602
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,000
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I TOLD HIM?

603
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,200
I DON'T THINK YOU TOLD HIM ANYTHING.

604
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,900
'CAUSE IF YOU HAD PROOF
THAT FOSS STARTED THE FIRE,

605
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,000
YOU'D BE GONE ALREADY.

606
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
I DON'T THINK YOU'D RISK
A $2 MILLION PAYOUT

607
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,500
JUST TO STICK IT TO ME.

608
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,200
NO, I THINK YOU PROBABLY
DID WHAT YOU ALWAYS DO.

609
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,400
YOU GAVE YOUR CLIENT JUST ENOUGH ROPE,

610
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,400
JUST ENOUGH TO HANG HIMSELF.

611
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,500
AM I RIGHT?

612
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,400
THIS TIME, NATE...

613
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,800
I THINK THERE'S JUST ENOUGH ROPE FOR TWO.

614
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,800
THERE'S NO WAY TO FAKE
THE NUMBERS ON THAT CHIP.

615
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,900
YOU FAKED IT BEFORE.

616
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,800
NO, NO, NO. I FAKED THE
INFORMATION ON THE DATABASE.

617
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,700
OKAY, NOW, WHEN FOSS SCANS THAT CHIP,

618
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,300
IF IT'S NOT THE SAME NUMBER
THAT SHOWED UP BEFORE --

619
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,600
OH, WE'RE SCREWED.

620
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,700
BASICALLY.

621
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,500
NOW, EITHER WE CUT
THE CHIP OUT OF THE HORSE

622
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,600
AND INSERT IT INTO ANOTHER ONE --

623
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,500
OR WE DELIVER KENTUCKY THUNDER.

624
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,200
NO, WE'RE NOT A LIBRARY.

625
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,500
WE CAN'T JUST TAKE HORSES
IN AND OUT AS WE LIKE.

626
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,600
KENTUCKY THUNDER'S GONE.

627
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
WHAT?

628
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,700
RACING?

629
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,700
WORSE. STUD FARM.

630
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,900
- OH.
- NO, NO.NO, NO, NO.

631
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,300
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE NOT GONNA GET
FOSS TO WRITE A $12 MILLION CHECK

632
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,400
FOR AN EMPTY HORSE TRAILER.

633
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,200
THIS DOESN'T WORK
WITHOUT KENTUCKY THUNDER.

634
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,400
SO WE'RE GONNA STALL.

635
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,200
NO.

636
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,200
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NO?

637
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,600
STERLING'S GONNA CATCH ON.

638
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,800
FOSS IS GONNA GET COLD FEET, MAN.

639
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,100
NO. WE HAVE A CHANCE.
WE GOT TO GET THIS HORSE.

640
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,400
OK, LISTEN. I AM NOT GONNA
JEOPARDIZE THE REST OF THE TEAM

641
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,900
BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO
PROVE TO YOUR HIGH-SCHOOL SWEETHEART.

642
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,800
IT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN

643
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,600
OH, AND YOU'RE NOT TRYING
TO PROVE SOMETHING TO STERLING?

644
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,300
YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO PROVE
SOMETHING TO THE WORLD

645
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,000
EVERY TIME WE HELP SOMEBODY OUT?

646
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,600
WE'RE ALL TRYING TO PROVE SOMETHING,

647
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,500
JUST BEING HERE WITH YOU.

648
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,400
IF IT GETS TOO CLOSE,

649
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,700
I WILL PULL THE PLUG

650
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,600
AND YOU AND YOU WILL WALK AWAY.

651
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,100
AND THAT WILL BE THAT.

652
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,900
AND YOU -- WHO DO YOU HAVE
SOMEONE TO PROVE TO?

653
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,200
MYSELF...

654
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,900
YOU ARROGANT SON OF A BITCH.

655
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,400
CAN YOU HACK IT?

656
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,100
HACK A LOCK?

657
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,500
NICE.

658
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,100
YOU STILL REALLY DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHAT I DO, DO YOU?

659
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,900
PARKER, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GO IN THROUGH THE AIR DUCT,

660
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,300
DROP DOWN, AND LET US IN.

661
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,700
BUT THE HORSES ARE IN THERE.

662
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,100
NO, NO, NO. THERE'S A BACK ROOM.

663
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,400
- THERE WON'T BE ANY HORSES IN THERE.
- WE NEED YOU TO DO THIS.

664
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,200
I NEED YOU TO DO THIS.

665
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,500
PLEASE.

666
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,000
LOOKS LIKE PARKER'S GONNA HAVE TO
CRAWL THROUGH THE AIR DUCT AGAIN.

667
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,000
GOD FORBID ANYONE ELSE WOULD LEARN

668
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,900
HOW TO FREAKIN' CRAWL ON THEIR
STOMACH THROUGH A TINY SPACE.

669
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,900
IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE, PEOPLE.

670
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,900
Parker, you realize that
we can still hear you.

671
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,700
AIMEE... I'VE FOUND KENTUCKY THUNDER.

672
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,100
- He's a really, really big horse.
- OH, I'M SO SORRY.

673
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,400
UH, YEAH, SOMETIMES THEY KEEP HIM
IN THERE BEFORE HE GETS TEASED.

674
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,000
I DON'T WANT TO BE
IN A STALL WITH A HORSE

675
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,400
THAT'S ABOUT TO BE TEASED!

676
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,500
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME, PARKER.

677
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,200
Parker, hurry up!

678
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,600
SEE, YOU'RE NOT DEAD. GOOD.

679
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,700
DON'T BE SILLY.

680
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,800
HORSES ARE MUCH LESS MURDEROUS
THAN I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT.

681
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,800
ALAN, WHEN I MET YOU
AT THE RACES THE OTHER DAY,

682
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,700
I SAID TO MYSELF,

683
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,200
"KITTY, NOW, THIS IS A MAN
WHO IS GOING TO TAKE YOU PLACES."

684
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,400
ARE WE GOING THE RIGHT WAY?

685
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,800
DARLIN', I'M QUITE FAMILIAR
WITH THESE STABLES.

686
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,600
WE'RE JUST TAKING A LITTLE SHORTCUT.

687
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,700
STERLING'S GONNA MEET US HERE,
AND A FEW INVESTORS ARE COMING, TOO.

688
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,000
THEY CAN'T WAIT TO MEET FEI KUAI.

689
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,200
AND HERE WE ARE.

690
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,900
I'VE NEVER COME THIS
WAY BEFORE. IT'S FUNNY.

691
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,200
I'M JUST GONNA GO CHECK ON THE TRUCK.

692
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,600
YOU STAY RIGHT HERE.

693
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,100
RIGHT HERE.

694
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,600
HEY. DID YOU GET HIM TURNED AROUND ENOUGH?

695
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,100
I THINK SO.

696
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,900
HE DOESN'T SEEM THAT
FAMILIAR WITH THE STABLES.

697
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,900
OKAY, FOSS IS IN PLACE.

698
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,900
Where are you?

699
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,600
WE'RE CLOSE. ANY MINUTE NOW.

700
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,000
Listen, the hauler's gonna
be here in five minutes.

701
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,800
IF YOU'RE NOT HERE, FOSS IS
GONNA OPEN UP AN EMPTY TRAILER

702
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,100
AND THERE'LL BE NO LOST HEIR.

703
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,400
I SAID WE'LL BE THERE!

704
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,700
HARDISON, SHOW ME WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT.

705
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,600
I'LL BE DAMNED.

706
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,900
We're going to jail.

707
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,500
MY FATHER'S LOST HIS JOB,

708
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,900
HE LOST HIS HORSES,

709
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,400
AND NOW HE'S GONNA HAVE
TO VISIT ME IN JAIL.

710
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,700
THAT'S GREAT.

711
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,200
ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, YOU'LL HAVE
ALL OF US TO KEEP YOU COMPANY.

712
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,900
HEY, NOBODY'S GOING TO JAIL.

713
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,200
I PROMISE YOU.

714
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,700
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT.

715
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,800
WHERE ARE --

716
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,700
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

717
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,200
WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT.
I'M PULLING THE PLUG.

718
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,000
ELIOT, BRING THE HORSE BACK
TO THE STUD FARM,

719
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,500
MEET US AT THE RENDEZVOUS SPOT.

720
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,600
Uh, boss, we might
have a hard time with that.

721
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,300
WHY?

722
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,600
OH, GREAT.

723
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,000
GREAT JOB NOT GETTING
EMOTIONALLY ATTACHED

724
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,500
OR DOING ANYTHING STUPID.

725
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
IT'S THE FRONT GATE.

726
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,600
THE HAULER'S HERE.

727
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,100
WELL, PERFECT. RIGHT ON TIME.

728
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,300
NO, WE GOT STERLING SHOWING UP ANY SECOND.

729
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,000
NOW, LISTEN, THIS THING -- IT'S OVER.

730
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,400
SO WE'RE GONNA DO THE
BLOWOFF RIGHT NOW BECAUSE --

731
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,800
WHOA.

732
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,600
PONY EXPRESS IS NEVER LATE, BOSS.

733
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,000
DIDN'T I TELL YOU I WAS GONNA KILL YOU?

734
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,200
OKAY. WE'RE BACK ON.

735
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,200
GIBSON CALLED. HE'S UPSET.

736
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,300
HE REALLY HAD HIS EYE ON THAT HORSE.

737
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,500
BUT I GUESS THE BEST MAN WON.

738
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,300
YEAH, WELL, I HAVE A WAY OF --

739
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,000
THINGS HAVE A WAY OF GOING IN MY DIRECTION.

740
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,500
- JUST LUCKY, I GUESS.
- I GUESS.

741
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,600
MR. FOSS, I GOT SOMETHING YOU
MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT.

742
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,700
YEAH, FIGURED YOU WOULD.

743
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,500
YOU MIGHT AS WELL DOUBLE-CHECKBEFORE MY
INSURANCE INVESTIGATOR TAKES A LOOK.

744
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,800
YOU KNOW, YOU WOULDN'T
WANT ANYTHING TO GO WRONG.

745
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,100
- RIGHT?
- GOOD THINKING.

746
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,800
THANK YOU.

747
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,700
SO, READY TO MAKE THIS OFFICIAL?

748
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,600
YES, I AM.

749
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,400
JUST SIGN HERE AND INITIAL THERE.

750
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,200
NOW, THERE'S JUST THAT
SMALL MATTER OF $12 MILLION.

751
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,300
$12 MILLION COMING RIGHT AT YOU.

752
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,000
WHY, THAT IS A LOVELY STRING OF ZEROS.

753
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,300
MY FRIENDS WILL BE VERY PLEASED.

754
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,500
RIGHT DOWN HERE.

755
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,500
I'M AFRAID I HAVE SOME
UNFORTUNATE NEWS, MR. FOSS.

756
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,700
HEY, STERLING, NOT RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

757
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,000
I'M SHOWING THEM THE HORSE.

758
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,100
THE HORSE YOU HAVE IN
THERE IS NOT FROM CHINA,

759
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:40,200
AND IT'S DEFINITELY NOT
THE LOST HEIR OF SECRETARIAT.

760
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,200
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

761
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,100
THAT HORSE IS KENTUCKY THUNDER.

762
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,100
WHAT?

763
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,000
THAT AIN'T KENTUCKY THUNDER.

764
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,500
WELL, OF COURSE IT ISN'T.
IT'S FEI KUAI.

765
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,900
0-2-2-1-3.

766
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,400
OKAY, OBVIOUSLY YOUR SCANNER ISN'T WORKING.

767
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,200
0-2-2-1-3.

768
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,600
OKAY, I-I JUST PUT THE HORSE IN HERE.

769
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,600
HOW IS THIS HAPPENING?

770
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,700
WHAT IS GOING ON, FOSS?

771
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,700
???HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW?

772
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,900
WHAT HORSE IS THIS?

773
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:22,300
THEY NEED MEN LIKE MYSELF
TO, UH, SHOW THEM VISION.

774
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,100
IT'S BALTIMORE.

775
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,700
UM...E-EXCUSE ME.

776
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,100
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

777
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,800
BECAUSE I LOST BALTIMORE IN A POKER GAME.

778
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,700
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU JUST BOUGHT HIM BACK.

779
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,500
AND YOU TRIED TO INSURE
HIM FOR $12 MILLION.

780
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,800
IN THE PREVIOUS CLAIM,

781
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,300
YOU INSURED THIS VERY
SAME HORSE FOR $200,000.

782
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,600
THAT'S INSURANCE FRAUD.

783
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,900
I'M GONNA HAVE TO DENY
YOUR CLAIM ON THE FIRE.

784
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,300
I THINK YOU OWE THESE
GENTLEMEN AN EXPLANATION.

785
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,000
I THINK HE OWES US $10 MILLION.

786
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,600
WHOA! WAIT!

787
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,900
HOLD ON!

788
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,600
LET ME JUST --

789
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,400
THIS IS NOT HA-- THIS ISN'T --

790
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,900
WE'RE GONNA --
WE'RE GONNA GET THE MONEY BACK.

791
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,800
DON'T "WE'RE GONNA GET THE MONEY BACK."

792
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,400
YOU'RE ON THE HOOK FOR FRAUD.
YOU'LL PAY THE DEBT.

793
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,800
$10 MILLION IS ALL I HAVE LEFT.

794
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,200
WE'LL SETTLE FOR THAT.

795
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,500
LOOKS GOOD. ALL RIGHT.

796
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,400
AND, UH...

797
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,000
WE GOT YOU JUST A LITTLE BIT
OF CASH TO GET YOUR STABLE GOING.

798
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
$12 MILLION MORE WILL BE
IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT.

799
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:54,100
AND HERE IS... YOUR FIRST HORSE.

800
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,300
THIS IS LEGAL?

801
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,700
ABSOLUTELY.

802
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,900
THE FRAUD INVALIDATES THE SECOND SALE.

803
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,800
OWNERSHIP REVERTS BACK
TO THE PREVIOUS OWNER -- ME --

804
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,100
AND I'M GIVING HIM TO YOU.

805
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,500
I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

806
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,100
NEXT HORSE I GET,
I'M NAMING HIM MR. FORD.

807
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,100
MR. FORD.

808
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,800
WELL, I LOOK FORWARD TO PUTTING
A LITTLE MONEY ON MR. FORD.

809
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:21,800
ALL RIGHT.

810
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,500
OKAY.

811
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,600
ELIOT, ELIOT?

812
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,300
YEAH, UH, COU-- CAN I --
COULD YOU GIVE ME, UH --

813
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,000
YEAH, YEAH. JUST -- YEAH.

814
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,100
SO...

815
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,100
I WAS WRONG.

816
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,600
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
HEARD YOU SAY THAT BEFORE.

817
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,800
WRONG ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY?

818
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,200
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BE
THE KIND TO SETTLE DOWN,

819
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,300
BUT, UH, I'M GLAD YOU FOUND A FAMILY.

820
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,200
TH--

821
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,300
THOSE GUYS?

822
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,200
I'M JUST SORRY IT COULDN'T BE ME.

823
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,400
* LIVING WITH ME, IT AIN'T EASY *

824
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,200
* WELL, I DO IT EVERY DAY

825
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,900
* AND SOMETIMES EVEN I

826
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,200
* I WANT TO RUN AWAY

827
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,700
* BUT THERE YOU ARE

828
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,600
* YOU'RE TRYING TO PLEASE ME

829
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,600
* AND YOU STAND YOUR GROUND

830
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,400
* THAT'S MORE THAN I DESERVE

831
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,500
NICE MOVE WITH THE
TOURISTS AND THE CAMERA.

832
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,300
DID YOU HAVE TO HIDE IN HARDISON'S
TRUNK ALL WEEK TO PULL THAT OFF?

833
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,100
YOUR CRACK TEAM HANDED ME THAT ONE.

834
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,000
A LITTLE SLOPPY, LETTING HER
HAVE BATHROOM BREAKS.

835
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,300
AND BRINGING KENTUCKY THUNDER'S TRAINER --

836
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,600
WELL, THAT WRAPPED THINGS UP NICELY FOR US.

837
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,300
MADE YOU LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT,
BUT HELPED US OUT.

838
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,800
AND THE PAPERWORK THAT YOU HAD FOSS SIGN

839
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,700
HELPED ME SAVE THE COMPANY
A PILE OF MONEY IN THE PAYOUT.

840
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,800
AND YOU KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

841
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,700
JUST HOW MUCH THEY HATE TO WRITE A CHECK.

842
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,200
LOOK...

843
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,500
IT'S TERRIBLE WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR SON.

844
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,200
NO ONE'S DENYING THAT.

845
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,400
SUFFERING DOESN'T
AUTOMATICALLY MAKE YOU A HERO.

846
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,400
I NEVER CLAIMED TO BE.

847
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,200
YOU JUST THINK YOU'RE ABOVE THE LAW.

848
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,100
OH, NO.

849
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,100
I LIKE TO THINK OF IT AS I PICK
UP WHERE THE LAW LEAVES OFF.

850
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,300
I'M NOT GONNA BE SO NICE NEXT TIME.

851
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,200
NEITHER WILL I.

852
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,900
