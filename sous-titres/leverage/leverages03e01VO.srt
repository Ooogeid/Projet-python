Season 3 Episode 1
<i>The Jailhouse Job</i>

2
00:00:08,524 --> 00:00:09,686
30 seconds.

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:10,968
Call it.

4
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:18,682
Two feds, but five cameras,
overlapping 180s,

5
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:21,085
response time 15 seconds.

6
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,226
Cameras are watching
yesterday's footage.

7
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:31,688
Locking down... Which elevator?

8
00:00:34,145 --> 00:00:34,995
What?

9
00:00:36,114 --> 00:00:38,037
Yes, I'm a go for elevator one.

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,371
Were you asleep?

11
00:00:41,234 --> 00:00:42,759
It's very peaceful up here.

12
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:45,091
Besides, I sleep better upside down.

13
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:53,267
- You okay?
- My papers!

14
00:00:53,392 --> 00:00:54,970
It's all right. I got 'em.

15
00:00:57,975 --> 00:00:58,891
Hey, you.

16
00:00:59,059 --> 00:00:59,869
You!

17
00:00:59,994 --> 00:01:02,936
You should have some signs up
or panels

18
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:05,522
- or something.
- I'll go. I'll go.

19
00:01:19,342 --> 00:01:20,342
Incoming.

20
00:01:46,984 --> 00:01:49,064
You could have just taken
the keys off the guy's belt.

21
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:50,192
This is faster.

22
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:57,597
What the hell?

23
00:02:22,945 --> 00:02:23,774
Get in!

24
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:33,782
- What do you mean "No"?
- It's a horrible plan.

25
00:02:33,907 --> 00:02:36,522
None of it times out, no way
you can get to the car that fast.

26
00:02:36,647 --> 00:02:39,605
But you have to admit, it'd be
a lot more dramatically satisfying

27
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,869
if I'm the one driving
the getaway car.

28
00:02:42,982 --> 00:02:44,786
You know they record these calls.

29
00:02:48,382 --> 00:02:50,794
<i>I created a carrier signal
for our conversation,</i>

30
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,754
but I'm dumping another conversation
onto the prison recording system.

31
00:02:54,282 --> 00:02:56,488
- Spanish soap opera.
- Yeah. Check it out, man.

32
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:59,009
Look, it turns out
pepe's twin brother Peppi

33
00:02:59,134 --> 00:03:01,313
is actually
Guadalupe's baby's daddy.

34
00:03:09,587 --> 00:03:10,887
He don't want to do it.

35
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:13,804
- But I love jumping on elevators.
- I know.

36
00:03:13,929 --> 00:03:16,062
This is my special elevator rig
he got me for Christmas.

37
00:03:16,187 --> 00:03:18,070
You took the fall for us, so...

38
00:03:18,195 --> 00:03:20,908
- After you lied to us. He's a liar.
- You took the fall for us.

39
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,133
You went to jail
so we wouldn't have to.

40
00:03:23,258 --> 00:03:25,276
We get that, so we're square.

41
00:03:25,401 --> 00:03:27,836
But now you got to let us
get you out of prison.

42
00:03:27,961 --> 00:03:31,227
- But if we're gonna do that...
- Not all of us are convinced we should.

43
00:03:31,352 --> 00:03:33,028
We have to hit you
at your next hearing.

44
00:03:33,153 --> 00:03:35,088
- That prison's escape-proof.
- <i>Guys, no.</i>

45
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:36,633
I committed a crime,

46
00:03:37,128 --> 00:03:38,141
I got caught,

47
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:40,416
and now I am gonna serve my time.

48
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:44,139
What kind of world would it be
if everybody that committed

49
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:47,684
a silly little crime went to prison?
Complete madness.

50
00:03:49,684 --> 00:03:51,063
Did you get the kielbasa?

51
00:03:53,992 --> 00:03:55,821
There's an earbud inside it.

52
00:03:57,542 --> 00:03:58,715
Now, listen to me,

53
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,324
in no way, shape, or form are you gonna
break me out of this prison. Understood?

54
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,493
<i>Okay, you know what?
Fine, Nate.</i>

55
00:04:04,618 --> 00:04:06,351
We're still out here.
We're doing the job.

56
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:09,054
We help people nobody else helps.
That's important.

57
00:04:09,179 --> 00:04:10,891
You want to stay around and miss out

58
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:13,894
just because you got to figure out your
guilty conscience, that's your loss.

59
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,116
<i>Yeah, Hardison, I was...</i>

60
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,215
Wait, Sophie...

61
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,603
- Just
- Who? Me?

62
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:23,640
I don't use the name "Sophie" anymore.
I use my real name now.

63
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,514
Your real... What is that?

64
00:04:25,887 --> 00:04:27,933
You know that they record
these calls, don't you?

65
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,076
That's Nate Ford, Mr. Worth.

66
00:04:48,596 --> 00:04:49,914
This the man you want?

67
00:04:57,344 --> 00:04:59,970
Yes, we'll need
all his court and prison records,

68
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:01,683
visitor logs, everything.

69
00:05:01,808 --> 00:05:03,559
This is a privately run prison.

70
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:07,927
Corporate facilities do not obey
the same rules as public prisons.

71
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:12,011
My employer wishes you
to understand,

72
00:05:12,136 --> 00:05:13,965
this is not a request.

73
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,107
We will not be providing
warrants, paperwork,

74
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,504
or any other form.

75
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:21,702
Warden, you will give us
all your files on Nathan Ford,

76
00:05:21,827 --> 00:05:24,514
or you will find yourself
and your company

77
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,826
under state, federal,
and international investigation.

78
00:05:28,176 --> 00:05:29,576
I am not a warden.

79
00:05:30,686 --> 00:05:33,707
I am CEO of National
Prison Properties.

80
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:38,086
I built this company, five prisons,
from the ground up.

81
00:05:42,254 --> 00:05:43,304
Impressive.

82
00:05:46,254 --> 00:05:47,471
You know what they say...

83
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,018
That Rome was not built
in a single day.

84
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:57,483
But it burned in one.

85
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:09,323
Seamus Heaney.
That Irish guy you asked for.

86
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:10,448
Excellent.

87
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:12,454
Thanks. Billy, right?

88
00:06:13,532 --> 00:06:15,650
Thank you. This could
not have been easy to find.

89
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,803
You seemed pretty down.

90
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,379
And we got to stand up
for each other, right?

91
00:06:21,738 --> 00:06:23,132
You're all right, Billy.

92
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,454
Wish the judge thought so.

93
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:27,509
Appreciate it.

94
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,272
I think something's happening.

95
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,342
Thanks for your input.

96
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,527
You can move on now.

97
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,747
Wait, wait.

98
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,834
Stop, okay.
You don't have to do this.

99
00:07:01,848 --> 00:07:03,048
Get the knife.

100
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:04,923
Come on. Let's go.

101
00:07:13,825 --> 00:07:15,115
What was that about, Billy?

102
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,582
Remember that '88 gangbanger
that got beat to death last month?

103
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:19,246
His buddy think I did it.

104
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:20,269
Did you?

105
00:07:20,394 --> 00:07:23,299
No, I found the body, all right, but
the guards say nobody else was near him,

106
00:07:23,424 --> 00:07:25,068
- so now I'm wanted for it.
- Here.

107
00:07:25,193 --> 00:07:26,411
That doesn't make sense.

108
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:28,806
The warden should have put you
in protective custody.

109
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,867
Look, I don't even know
why I'm in prison.

110
00:07:32,992 --> 00:07:34,468
You want to hear what I did?

111
00:07:34,593 --> 00:07:36,961
I drove up to new Hampshire
to see my girlfriend, all right?

112
00:07:37,086 --> 00:07:38,612
I had beer in the trunk.

113
00:07:38,737 --> 00:07:42,121
I crossed state lines.
I didn't even know that was illegal.

114
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:44,038
- You expect me to believe that?
- I swear.

115
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,994
I didn't even have a lawyer
for the hearing.

116
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:47,559
They said it was just a fine.

117
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:50,469
I plead guilty. Next thing I know,
I'm in here for eight months!

118
00:07:50,822 --> 00:07:52,471
I'm a frickin' accountant, man.

119
00:07:52,785 --> 00:07:54,481
All right, you're an accountant.

120
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:57,267
Wait. What is that for?

121
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,201
- It's kielbasa.
- I know that,

122
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:02,397
but what are you doing with it?
Don't...

123
00:08:03,302 --> 00:08:05,205
Come on, man!
That's nasty.

124
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,235
In your ear. That's great.

125
00:08:10,345 --> 00:08:13,801
We extended our hand of forgiveness
and you slapped it away.

126
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,257
Now go away.
I'm having some "Me" Time.

127
00:08:16,382 --> 00:08:19,372
<i>Please, I just want you to check
the records of an inmate,</i>

128
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,542
Billy Epping.

129
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,751
- Fast!
- Who are you talking to?

130
00:08:30,023 --> 00:08:33,859
William Epping's conviction was for
transporting liquor across state lines,

131
00:08:33,984 --> 00:08:35,514
but his sentence was way longer

132
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:39,142
<i>anyone received for this crime since,
like the Pilgrims, man.</i>

133
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,561
- Talkin' to a frickin' sausage.
- <i>That's weird.</i>

134
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,565
Your warden was consulted
on the sentencing.

135
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,565
That's hinky.

136
00:08:48,248 --> 00:08:49,236
Why are you...

137
00:08:50,483 --> 00:08:53,573
Now, listen to me,
we're gonna check this out, okay?

138
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,417
- Which I'm gonna do.
- All right.

139
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,995
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

140
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:09,548
Why don't you gather the team and get me
background checks on the warden?

141
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,342
- You stabbed me!
- Come on, just a little. It's fine.

142
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:16,112
Did you find us a client in prison?

143
00:09:16,237 --> 00:09:18,181
Yes, we are going
to help Billy Epping

144
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,914
and maybe take down
a warden at the same time.

145
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:24,020
Stop!
Who the hell are you talking to?

146
00:09:24,755 --> 00:09:26,610
I'm gonna pass out.

147
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:28,441
I'm gonna pass out.

148
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,648
Yeah. Just... Yeah.

149
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,782
How did I get started?

150
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,250
Hedge funds, actually,

151
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,171
and then a bit of
international finance.

152
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,971
But then 10 years ago,
I hit on this...

153
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:46,960
National Prison Properties.

154
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:50,047
Get the government out
of the justice business.

155
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:53,236
- Mister...
- Barrington-Jones.

156
00:09:53,714 --> 00:09:54,555
Brilliant.

157
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,921
Corporate-run prisons, five facilities,
thousands of inmates,

158
00:09:58,046 --> 00:09:59,248
it's tremendous.

159
00:09:59,373 --> 00:10:02,759
The US has the fastest growing
prison population in the world.

160
00:10:02,884 --> 00:10:04,862
It's like the real-estate boom.

161
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:07,446
Except, of course,
the problem with real estate...

162
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:09,399
You eventually run out of land.

163
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:12,861
You never run out of people
to put in prison.

164
00:10:13,885 --> 00:10:17,385
We haven't had much success with
the private prisons concept in England.

165
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,134
Our investment firm
has large real-estate holdings

166
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:22,089
for construction of facilities.

167
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:25,499
You see, any yahoo can lay some concrete
and throw up some razor wire.

168
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:28,373
The profit comes
in proper management.

169
00:10:28,498 --> 00:10:31,366
For example, the big money for us
is in prison labor.

170
00:10:31,974 --> 00:10:32,708
Sorry?

171
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,467
Goods and services
made by prisoners in America...

172
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:37,430
$2 billion a year.

173
00:10:37,684 --> 00:10:41,390
One out of every five office chairs
and desks "Made in America":

174
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,659
Made by convicts.

175
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:46,435
And those jobs are not
going to the Chinese

176
00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:48,433
Bottom's up.

177
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:56,697
- Is this really the best plan?
- The infirmary's under lockdown.

178
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,740
There's cameras
on both sides of the door,

179
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:02,244
extra guards because the pharmaceuticals.
It's the safest place in the prison.

180
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:06,061
Plus, I got you a little extra insurance
coming right now.

181
00:11:07,215 --> 00:11:08,634
Abernathy, MD.

182
00:11:09,191 --> 00:11:12,282
Here's my C13-A state
employment certification.

183
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:16,533
There's my processing forms,
the A76/4...

184
00:11:16,658 --> 00:11:18,427
You worked prison clinic before?

185
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:20,516
Have I worked...

186
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:24,753
Sorry. If you'll look on this,
you can see my history right here.

187
00:11:24,878 --> 00:11:26,589
Framingham, Concord.

188
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:29,440
Hell, my roommate at Tufts
drives a Benz

189
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:32,138
and fixes little girls' noses,
rich ones.

190
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,777
I got shanked by my own scalpel
last year in the neck.

191
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,488
- Already. Welcome to Rockford.
- Thank you.

192
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,209
The guard will stay.

193
00:11:40,746 --> 00:11:41,746
Yo, Ford...

194
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:43,097
Clear out.

195
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:46,112
In one minute.

196
00:11:46,237 --> 00:11:49,477
Billy, Dr. Abernathy.
I'm gonna be taking a look at you.

197
00:11:51,634 --> 00:11:54,735
If you do exactly what I say,
I'm gonna get you home...

198
00:11:55,951 --> 00:11:57,350
Alive, okay?

199
00:11:57,978 --> 00:11:59,418
- Thanks.
- Okay.

200
00:11:59,641 --> 00:12:02,175
- Ford, come on. Let's go.
- Yeah, just...

201
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,786
I need to talk to you.

202
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:08,965
Oh, God.

203
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,459
What did you do? Did you do
something? What happened?

204
00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:14,783
- Your tooth? Your mouth?
- It's like shooting pain through my...

205
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:18,445
- Hold up. That's infected.
- It's just a shooting.

206
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,947
I can take you down to dental.
I can take care of this right now

207
00:12:21,072 --> 00:12:22,980
and you give me one second.
We'll be right back.

208
00:12:23,105 --> 00:12:25,465
- I have to go with you.
- You have to go with us? Come on.

209
00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:29,206
Make sure you get your earplugs, because
I'm gonna be sawing through some bone,

210
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,953
and the "Zzz" is really loud.

211
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:34,678
And the burning flesh
and stuff, I'll try to have...

212
00:12:35,503 --> 00:12:37,425
We can just... You know what?

213
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,104
It's fine. Just right in here, sir.
And please have a seat.

214
00:12:45,302 --> 00:12:47,339
It's just in case
the guards come in.

215
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:52,569
Restraints.

216
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,273
Here's an infirmary manual.

217
00:13:07,056 --> 00:13:08,738
That's for the guards, right?

218
00:13:08,863 --> 00:13:11,697
To people that run
a con on their own team?

219
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:17,398
Almost get people killed
'cause they're out of control?

220
00:13:18,374 --> 00:13:19,793
Are we okay, Eliot?

221
00:13:29,786 --> 00:13:31,226
Adam worth IV.

222
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,873
Harvard business school.

223
00:13:32,998 --> 00:13:35,480
Old money political dynasty
in this state.

224
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,320
His daddy was a Governor.

225
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:40,842
His uncle was an Attorney General,
and his brother is...

226
00:13:40,967 --> 00:13:42,471
the Congressman.

227
00:13:42,596 --> 00:13:45,284
Adam here even took a couple
of early runs at Office,

228
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:47,200
Couldn't get elected
as a dogcatcher.

229
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,467
That's why he got into business.

230
00:13:49,592 --> 00:13:51,741
- Hardison's working him.
- First, we have to figure out

231
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:54,177
how to nail the warden
on whatever scam he's running here.

232
00:13:54,302 --> 00:13:56,918
Secondly, we got to get Billy
out of here in case things go bad.

233
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,379
Told you this place is escape-proof.

234
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,842
21st-century prison,
fewer guards, more tech...

235
00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:07,844
Infra-Red cameras,
motion sensors, lockdown doors.

236
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,212
Does Parker have any ideas?

237
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:11,702
She's working with...

238
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:15,687
Sophie.

239
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:18,398
- What was that?
- I didn't...

240
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,245
A little pause there.

241
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:27,157
Sophie told us her real name. I'm not
allowed to say it in front of you.

242
00:14:27,436 --> 00:14:29,776
- Seriously?
- Her and Parker...

243
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:31,870
they're running the judge.

244
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:41,304
How can you possible think
that the Santa Clara case was...

245
00:14:41,763 --> 00:14:43,778
- Excuse me.
- It's all right.

246
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,906
But it's absurd.

247
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:47,703
- No other case has...
- This is yours.

248
00:14:47,828 --> 00:14:51,230
come so close to almost destroying
democracy as we know it.

249
00:14:51,355 --> 00:14:55,050
Honestly, I don't even know what
they teach you in law school these days.

250
00:15:03,493 --> 00:15:05,570
Key card and checkbook.

251
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,191
Keys and appointment book.

252
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,057
And this?

253
00:15:11,182 --> 00:15:12,619
Safe deposit box key.

254
00:15:14,152 --> 00:15:15,288
I love a secret.

255
00:15:24,143 --> 00:15:25,834
Yes, this is Mrs. Melvoy.

256
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,186
I'm calling about my account.

257
00:15:29,665 --> 00:15:31,456
Account number...

258
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,790
0018345.

259
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,938
Yes, I got a call
about my safe deposit box,

260
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,269
that a payment was do.

261
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,350
Billy Epping...

262
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,496
And more...

263
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,947
A lot more...

264
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,740
All sent to Rockford Correctional.

265
00:15:51,528 --> 00:15:54,369
Two years ago,
Judge Melvoy got a safe deposit box

266
00:15:54,494 --> 00:15:57,345
right around the time he started
sending people down for hard time.

267
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,776
And I'm talking citizens,
not people like us.

268
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:02,842
Judge Melvoy's not the only one.

269
00:16:02,967 --> 00:16:05,430
Four judges opened safe deposit
boxes at the same time.

270
00:16:05,555 --> 00:16:08,231
There are hundreds of cases here,

271
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:10,357
and these are just the ones
that we've found.

272
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,471
Records I pulled off
of Worth's computer

273
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,078
show that each time
an inmate checks in at Rockford,

274
00:16:16,203 --> 00:16:17,746
their judge gets an e-mail.

275
00:16:17,871 --> 00:16:21,292
<i>Now, it looks coded. I'm thinking
Cayman Islands bank account.</i>

276
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:24,139
Hardison, private prisons
have a contract with the State

277
00:16:24,264 --> 00:16:26,163
just like any company
that provides a service.

278
00:16:26,288 --> 00:16:28,438
Now, do they have to maintain
a head count?

279
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:33,491
See, Rockford can't drop
below 70% occupancy.

280
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,636
If they do,
they lose their state funding.

281
00:16:36,074 --> 00:16:38,147
No state money, they close.

282
00:16:38,272 --> 00:16:40,551
And they came
very close two years ago.

283
00:16:41,338 --> 00:16:43,699
So, private prisons
are like the hotel business.

284
00:16:43,824 --> 00:16:45,886
They live and die
on occupancy, head count.

285
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:48,423
Now, worth wasn't gonna lose
$100 million in profit

286
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,387
<i>just 'cause he didn't have
enough hard-cases to fill the prison.</i>

287
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:54,825
He puts a few judges on the arm
to send him non-violent offenders,

288
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,721
easy prisoners to supervise.

289
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:00,467
- But why these people?
- Because they're citizens.

290
00:17:02,393 --> 00:17:04,981
'Cause they're honest,
middle-class citizens.

291
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,880
These are the people,
they don't want to cause any trouble.

292
00:17:08,005 --> 00:17:10,888
They can't afford a lawyer,
if some judge sends them away.

293
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:12,483
Yes, sir.

294
00:17:12,608 --> 00:17:15,696
They were taught to trust the courts.
They believe in the system.

295
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:19,496
What you got?

296
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:24,042
Worth makes money
sending innocent people to prison.

297
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,337
I have just the thing.

298
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:34,310
Lovely suit.

299
00:17:34,756 --> 00:17:36,783
Thank you.
Hand-made.

300
00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:38,067
Paris.

301
00:17:38,192 --> 00:17:40,039
Gonna have to change that,
Mr. Worth.

302
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:42,220
You'll only be wearing
American from now on.

303
00:17:42,345 --> 00:17:43,595
Here's my card.

304
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:48,566
- This doesn't happen every day.
- No, it does not.

305
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,225
You'll remember this day.

306
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,381
This is the day you became
a United States Senator.

307
00:18:04,189 --> 00:18:05,267
It's busy.

308
00:18:05,392 --> 00:18:07,730
It is an election year, Mr. Worth.

309
00:18:07,855 --> 00:18:10,132
Which leads me to my little problem.

310
00:18:15,891 --> 00:18:18,532
Senator Camp.
He's a lock for re-election.

311
00:18:18,657 --> 00:18:19,694
He was.

312
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,451
So, Mr. Worth...

313
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,029
These...

314
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:37,688
are from my sources at the Globe.

315
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,953
They want to run
the story this week.

316
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,622
You remember what I showed you.
Just try some different shapes.

317
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,877
And that pout that we talked about.
No, not that one.

318
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:52,046
I didn't show her that.
Just open your mouth.

319
00:18:52,926 --> 00:18:54,716
Kind of... Just relax.

320
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:56,176
Try one up, one down.

321
00:18:56,391 --> 00:18:59,053
Maybe...
Yeah. Shoot that.

322
00:19:00,256 --> 00:19:02,184
I like that. That's gonna work.

323
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,021
- Looks good.
- I can work with that.

324
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,651
Why am I looking away?

325
00:19:14,172 --> 00:19:15,608
Senator happy pants

326
00:19:15,733 --> 00:19:18,766
picked the worst possible
time to get caught.

327
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,843
The deadline for filing for
the next election is Friday.

328
00:19:21,968 --> 00:19:23,902
This story leaks, he resigns,

329
00:19:24,027 --> 00:19:27,466
I've got less than 72 hours
to find me a candidate.

330
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:32,295
I have considered running,
but I don't have any campaign people.

331
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,642
<i>Adam Worth...</i>

332
00:19:38,116 --> 00:19:40,553
<i>a self-made man
who's dedicated his life</i>

333
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,157
<i>to keeping criminals
away from our children.</i>

334
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:44,982
<i>Tough on crime.</i>

335
00:19:45,107 --> 00:19:46,635
<i>Tough on spending.</i>

336
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,134
<i>Tough for you.</i>

337
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:52,511
Sample polls have
you 15 points ahead

338
00:19:52,636 --> 00:19:54,827
without even running a single ad.

339
00:19:55,731 --> 00:19:57,968
Women aged 18-49

340
00:19:58,093 --> 00:20:00,073
just eat you up with a spoon.

341
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:03,947
Want to see your campaign posters?

342
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,840
Worth's on the hook.

343
00:20:07,435 --> 00:20:10,135
Now, I give to give it to you, Nate,
nobody can read a mark quite like you.

344
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,222
He tried to run twice and failed.
That had to have been eating away at him.

345
00:20:13,347 --> 00:20:15,129
Now, find me a way
out of this place.

346
00:20:17,003 --> 00:20:19,470
Billy showed me where he found
the first dead gang member.

347
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:22,390
- Blind spot... no cameras.
- Nice coincidence.

348
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:24,840
Yeah, and Hardison checked
the incident reports.

349
00:20:24,965 --> 00:20:27,711
All of them happened
in camera blind spots...

350
00:20:27,836 --> 00:20:29,769
Places convicts
wouldn't know existed.

351
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:33,158
- Guards.
- They killed him, accident, whatever,

352
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:35,735
they let Billy here find him,
wouldn't be the first time.

353
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,443
<i>Can we use the blind spots?</i>

354
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,637
I really want a back door
out of this place.

355
00:20:39,762 --> 00:20:41,735
I can't access
those cameras from here.

356
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,725
They're dumb.
They run straight to the server.

357
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:47,258
They could have upgraded the motion
sensors and infrareds since these plans.

358
00:20:47,383 --> 00:20:50,039
You're gonna have to map it out...
Old-school.

359
00:20:54,088 --> 00:20:55,318
Lockdown bolt.

360
00:21:03,981 --> 00:21:05,221
Lockdown bolt.

361
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,636
Motion sensor.

362
00:21:56,726 --> 00:21:58,234
And heat sensor.

363
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:04,734
Nate, if you could see this,
you would not be encouraged.

364
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:14,186
Yeah, I see it.

365
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:19,462
I hope Sophie has more luck
with the warden.

366
00:22:21,013 --> 00:22:22,107
Who's Sophie?

367
00:22:22,379 --> 00:22:25,587
You remember, we're not supposed
to use her real name with...

368
00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:28,056
Right, Nate hasn't earned it yet.

369
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:28,993
Forgot.

370
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:45,305
The average Senate Race in America
costs $8 million.

371
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,952
You can buy a senate seat cheaper
than a house on Beacon Hill.

372
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:51,568
The trick is to come out strong.

373
00:22:51,693 --> 00:22:54,288
If you have, say,
a quarter million dollars

374
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:57,002
of your own money in a campaign
fund when you announce,

375
00:22:57,127 --> 00:23:00,848
I promise you will clear the field
of all the other candidates.

376
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,832
I'm going to be a Senator.

377
00:23:03,957 --> 00:23:05,466
If you're serious.

378
00:23:05,709 --> 00:23:08,775
We already have a federally
approved account set up.

379
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,756
You just have to transfer
your funds into it.

380
00:23:15,165 --> 00:23:17,504
- Let's do it.
- I knew you were the right choice.

381
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,814
And you'll be matching my funds.

382
00:23:20,852 --> 00:23:23,911
Miss Lucas, I need to know
that we're partners in this.

383
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:26,881
A quarter million from me,
a quarter million from the party.

384
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:29,657
You put in your money first,
then I put mine in.

385
00:23:30,043 --> 00:23:32,071
I need to know if your are serious.

386
00:23:32,595 --> 00:23:34,369
Of course.

387
00:23:35,052 --> 00:23:36,804
It'll be done this afternoon.

388
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:39,099
Just wait till you see our money
go into the account,

389
00:23:39,224 --> 00:23:41,111
and then transfer your funds in.

390
00:23:41,236 --> 00:23:42,236
Very good.

391
00:23:44,178 --> 00:23:46,369
Sorry.
This is your office.

392
00:23:48,712 --> 00:23:50,942
All right, we cut that wire.

393
00:23:52,081 --> 00:23:54,311
Look, once a lockdown is called,

394
00:23:54,436 --> 00:23:57,479
all these sensors go hot
and those door bolts drop into place.

395
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:58,665
I got it!

396
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:01,814
The furnace room.

397
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:05,059
There's no sensors
because it's too hot.

398
00:24:05,664 --> 00:24:07,573
They crawl straight down
along the heating pipes

399
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:09,544
until they reach the sewage system.

400
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:12,283
Parker, it's a 150 degrees in there.

401
00:24:13,711 --> 00:24:15,995
The average human can
withstand that for 27 seconds.

402
00:24:17,044 --> 00:24:19,550
- What? Come on.
- Worth is on the hook,

403
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:22,668
but with $250,000 of ours
as a buy-in.

404
00:24:23,582 --> 00:24:24,838
<i>Did I say "Ours"?</i>

405
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,715
I meant what's left
of your life savings.

406
00:24:28,515 --> 00:24:30,259
We took it out of your account.

407
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:32,178
- Any luck here?
- No.

408
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:34,619
Got it.

409
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:37,512
"B" Corridor,
through to the kitchen,

410
00:24:37,637 --> 00:24:40,186
into the freezer,
into the freezer air exchange,

411
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:44,023
<i>into the machine tunnels,
which will lead me to the roof</i>

412
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,241
or the parking lot.

413
00:24:45,366 --> 00:24:48,903
You got to beat the lockdown door.
There's lots of pressure on that bolt.

414
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:52,154
- There's motion sensors in the kitchen.
- And infrared in the machine corridor.

415
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:54,075
All to get to the roof
or the parking lot,

416
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:57,745
<i>where you'll be trapped
and probably brutally gunned down.</i>

417
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,413
Got a way out of that?

418
00:24:59,903 --> 00:25:01,227
I'm working on it.

419
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:04,147
My bank just called.

420
00:25:04,272 --> 00:25:06,842
The state party put $250,000

421
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:08,727
into my leadership fund.

422
00:25:09,262 --> 00:25:11,234
I just moved in my matching funds.

423
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:13,441
Congratulations, Senator.

424
00:25:14,664 --> 00:25:18,043
That means I need
the entire operation cleaned up.

425
00:25:18,168 --> 00:25:19,392
Squeaky clean.

426
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:23,475
Whatever your guards are doing
for side income, it stops.

427
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:27,481
- There's gonna be a lot of grumbling.
- Then fire them.

428
00:25:27,606 --> 00:25:30,288
What's the use of being non-union
if I can't fire people?

429
00:25:30,846 --> 00:25:33,330
- Are there any loose ends?
- The Epping kid.

430
00:25:33,455 --> 00:25:35,913
If the state decides to investigate
that gang murder,

431
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:38,698
put him in front of a Grand Jury,
they're gonna like him.

432
00:25:39,008 --> 00:25:40,586
The cover story could come apart.

433
00:25:40,711 --> 00:25:43,138
This is what happens when you don't
take care of things yourself.

434
00:25:43,263 --> 00:25:46,162
My guys were just supposed
to rough the gangbanger up.

435
00:25:46,699 --> 00:25:50,089
- Things got out of hand.
- So, make sure this time, personally.

436
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:52,091
Tomorrow, turn off the cameras,

437
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,477
go in the infirmary,
and kill Epping.

438
00:25:54,962 --> 00:25:56,062
Case closed.

439
00:25:59,932 --> 00:26:00,989
No guns.

440
00:26:01,114 --> 00:26:02,768
Make it look like a prison hit.

441
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:05,917
Kill the cameras.

442
00:26:11,642 --> 00:26:13,552
Mr. Barrington-Jones...

443
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,157
Welcome back.

444
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:18,268
Thanks for seeing me again.

445
00:26:18,393 --> 00:26:20,953
I fly out tonight, but my shareholders
have a few more questions.

446
00:26:26,908 --> 00:26:28,002
Supervisor Worth.

447
00:26:30,085 --> 00:26:32,089
Mr. Worth, thank you for your help.

448
00:26:32,845 --> 00:26:35,615
<i>I was thinking
you should take a close look</i>

449
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,392
<i>at Nate Ford's visitor logs...</i>

450
00:26:39,325 --> 00:26:40,761
Especially the video.

451
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,435
Would you excuse me
for just a moment?

452
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,870
Nate, the cameras just went down.

453
00:27:00,277 --> 00:27:02,008
- Okay, where?
- <i>The whole system.</i>

454
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:04,888
They faked a reboot.
It's down for five minutes.

455
00:27:05,189 --> 00:27:07,973
Eliot, get ready.
They're coming for Billy.

456
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,349
- Push in closer.
- Yes, sir.

457
00:27:33,397 --> 00:27:35,611
Parker, please tell me
you're at Hardison's new van.

458
00:27:35,997 --> 00:27:38,113
Yeah, it's really nice.

459
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,406
Did you bring it?

460
00:27:39,911 --> 00:27:41,325
Wait, are we doing that now?

461
00:27:42,592 --> 00:27:44,620
Yeah, we're gonna
breaking out right now.

462
00:27:47,905 --> 00:27:50,155
Sophie, I need you to help
guide me through it.

463
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,539
We're on the count.

464
00:27:51,664 --> 00:27:53,285
Nate, when they call "Lockdown,"

465
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,381
every door
in the prison seals tight.

466
00:28:06,362 --> 00:28:07,403
How you doing?

467
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,962
Look at me. Look at me.

468
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:39,591
A little sloppy.

469
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,220
New glasses.

470
00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:43,740
I am an accountant, okay?

471
00:28:43,865 --> 00:28:45,652
Come on, come on. Go, go, go, go!

472
00:28:53,404 --> 00:28:54,490
Lockdown!

473
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,150
Call lockdown!

474
00:28:56,774 --> 00:28:57,712
Copy that.

475
00:28:59,464 --> 00:29:01,847
<i>Lockdown. We are in lockdown.</i>

476
00:29:01,972 --> 00:29:04,984
<i>Lockdown in 5, 4, 3...</i>

477
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:06,340
We're not gonna make it.

478
00:29:06,465 --> 00:29:07,971
<i>2, 1...</i>

479
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:11,167
<i>Lockdown.</i>

480
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,620
Newspaper folded eight times
can support a ton of weight.

481
00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:21,917
Come on.

482
00:29:28,671 --> 00:29:30,142
First Boston Independent Bank.

483
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,421
- <i>How can I help you?</i>
- This is Adam Worth.

484
00:29:32,546 --> 00:29:35,104
I want to close an account.
Move money out of it right now.

485
00:29:35,229 --> 00:29:38,484
- <i>Which account, sir?</i>
- $250,000, the Worth Campaign Fund.

486
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,069
I'm sorry, sir,
for a transaction of that size,

487
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:43,405
<i>you're gonna have to come
to the bank in person.</i>

488
00:29:44,413 --> 00:29:46,112
That was Worth.
I stalled him,

489
00:29:46,237 --> 00:29:48,285
but he's on his way to the bank
as we speak.

490
00:29:49,171 --> 00:29:51,609
Mr. Barrington-Jones, I have to go.

491
00:29:53,683 --> 00:29:55,000
What is that alarm?

492
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,237
A lockdown.

493
00:29:57,038 --> 00:29:58,620
Bellows, what's going on?

494
00:29:59,112 --> 00:30:00,112
Here you go.

495
00:30:00,518 --> 00:30:02,358
Billy Epping is on the run.

496
00:30:02,604 --> 00:30:04,842
I think that Ford guy is in on it.

497
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,081
Look, I don't have time for this.

498
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:08,647
Call me tomorrow,

499
00:30:09,257 --> 00:30:11,558
- and we'll reschedule, please.
- No, if we just...

500
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,603
Don't forget your dry-cleaning.

501
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:21,735
And 3, 2, 1.

502
00:30:23,728 --> 00:30:25,931
- Go. Do what I told you.
- All right, Good luck.

503
00:30:31,853 --> 00:30:33,001
Motion sensor.

504
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:35,457
- Nate.
- <i>Steam's filling up now.</i>

505
00:30:38,763 --> 00:30:40,111
Motion sensor beat.

506
00:30:54,316 --> 00:30:55,316
Breathe.

507
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,217
And heat sensor cleared.

508
00:31:01,534 --> 00:31:02,534
Last stop.

509
00:31:16,779 --> 00:31:18,443
No reports from any of the patrols.

510
00:31:18,568 --> 00:31:19,884
Get me the cameras!

511
00:31:22,017 --> 00:31:23,589
Exterior. Show me the roof.

512
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:28,959
No way.

513
00:32:05,393 --> 00:32:08,760
We're still on lockdown.
I've got men in the ventilation system.

514
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,303
I've got K9 teams
working the exterior fence.

515
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,767
- <i>What's happening at the bank?</i>
- I don't know.

516
00:32:14,138 --> 00:32:17,692
- This smells like a setup.
- Sir, you got here just in time.

517
00:32:17,817 --> 00:32:20,896
Someone else attempted to close
this account out earlier today.

518
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,982
But I still have it, right?
All my money in the account?

519
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:25,525
Yes. And the rest?

520
00:32:26,872 --> 00:32:30,440
There's still another $250,000
in the account.

521
00:32:30,565 --> 00:32:31,958
Yes, all of it.

522
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,450
I'll take all of it.

523
00:32:33,882 --> 00:32:35,944
There!
It's Ford and Epping together!

524
00:32:36,811 --> 00:32:38,481
That vehicle is still out there?

525
00:32:39,331 --> 00:32:40,290
Come on!

526
00:33:01,043 --> 00:33:01,812
Epping.

527
00:33:06,257 --> 00:33:07,151
Sorry, sir.

528
00:33:08,074 --> 00:33:08,953
I say.

529
00:33:09,078 --> 00:33:11,155
There was an escapee,
we're checking all the cars.

530
00:33:13,136 --> 00:33:15,595
My name is Lester.
Lester Barrington-Jones.

531
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,034
I've had a meeting with your warden.
This is...

532
00:33:19,615 --> 00:33:21,355
- my secretary.
- Fiona.

533
00:33:21,713 --> 00:33:22,686
Secretary.

534
00:33:22,811 --> 00:33:23,626
Sure.

535
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:26,170
Sir, I need you to clear out.
'cause we're busy here.

536
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,588
Of course. Of course.

537
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,215
- Let's go!
- You, yeah.

538
00:33:32,994 --> 00:33:34,975
I like this.
I like when we pretend to kiss.

539
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,170
"Pretend"?

540
00:33:39,463 --> 00:33:40,463
An escape?

541
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:43,301
I've got news Crews.
I have a Governor on my call sheet.

542
00:33:43,426 --> 00:33:45,356
Every contact I have is in jeopardy.

543
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:47,149
Mr. Worth,

544
00:33:48,178 --> 00:33:49,725
Detective Captain Bonanno.

545
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,822
Massachusetts State Police.

546
00:33:53,346 --> 00:33:55,490
- I think we have a lead.
- Thank God.

547
00:33:56,111 --> 00:33:59,464
If we catch them before the week-end,
maybe we get out of this in one piece.

548
00:33:59,802 --> 00:34:03,791
We have security video of Nathan Ford
abandoning his getaway car.

549
00:34:08,342 --> 00:34:10,631
Wait. I know that parking lot.

550
00:34:10,908 --> 00:34:12,549
- That's my bank!
- Yeah.

551
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,635
Actually, that's your car.

552
00:34:34,714 --> 00:34:37,241
Is there a good reason you drove away
from your prison

553
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,870
in the middle of an escape attempt?

554
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,123
- Well, I was...
- This is my favorite part.

555
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:52,477
- He stole my dry-cleaning.
- Yeah, and it fits him really nicely,

556
00:34:53,215 --> 00:34:55,843
Which is odd,
because I've met Nate Ford,

557
00:34:56,156 --> 00:34:57,970
And he's a good
four inches taller than you.

558
00:34:58,649 --> 00:35:00,987
So, what, you just happened
to have a custom-made suit

559
00:35:01,112 --> 00:35:03,559
in your back seat perfectly tailored
for your accomplice?

560
00:35:04,092 --> 00:35:05,710
Don't forget your dry-cleaning.

561
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,862
"Accomplice"?
Now wait a minute.

562
00:35:15,274 --> 00:35:17,990
Epping is his accomplice.
They escaped together.

563
00:35:18,497 --> 00:35:20,212
You got two problems with that.

564
00:35:20,337 --> 00:35:22,161
First, if you're referring
to William Epping,

565
00:35:22,645 --> 00:35:24,121
he's still inside this prison.

566
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:30,808
And second, while Nate Ford
was changing clothes in your back seat,

567
00:35:30,933 --> 00:35:33,380
you were inside the bank
clearing out your account.

568
00:35:35,226 --> 00:35:36,540
Yeah, that's right,

569
00:35:36,665 --> 00:35:39,303
the one he put a quarter million dollars
into for the bribe, remember?

570
00:35:40,206 --> 00:35:41,413
Did I say "Ours"?

571
00:35:41,538 --> 00:35:44,099
I meant what's left
of your life savings.

572
00:35:44,438 --> 00:35:46,560
Yeah, we took it out
of your account.

573
00:35:47,772 --> 00:35:50,439
Yes, all of it. I'll take all of it.

574
00:35:51,543 --> 00:35:53,633
Yeah, the only thing
we found in your car...

575
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:55,944
was this list of state judges.

576
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,243
- That could be anything.
- I don't know.

577
00:36:03,577 --> 00:36:05,382
Nathan Ford is a very bad man.

578
00:36:06,296 --> 00:36:08,886
I think we better get some warrants
and talk to these judges.

579
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,807
They could be in trouble.

580
00:36:12,249 --> 00:36:14,505
- Give me your hands. Let's go.
- Tell me, Mr. Worth,

581
00:36:14,956 --> 00:36:18,675
what kind of guy makes money
letting guilty people out of prison.

582
00:36:19,163 --> 00:36:20,417
Get him out of here.

583
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,648
Where do you think you're going?

584
00:36:42,552 --> 00:36:44,395
What have you done to my apartment?

585
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,412
I'm the landlord, and this place
was vacant. We needed an office.

586
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:50,941
I got staggered flights on Air France.
Nate, I put you on a train to New York,

587
00:36:51,066 --> 00:36:53,252
- then you fly out on Air Uruguay.
- What are you tal...

588
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,629
Your passport has you as Juan Ford,
coffee merchant.

589
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:56,885
Now, look,

590
00:36:57,197 --> 00:36:59,007
we all <i>rendez-vous</i> in Paris and...

591
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,945
<i>Buona sera,</i> signore Ford.

592
00:37:13,478 --> 00:37:15,659
- I would prefer wine.
- Good for you.

593
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,782
- How did you know that...
- Some third party was at play?

594
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:25,279
Come on,

595
00:37:25,404 --> 00:37:28,509
the entire plan depended
on Worth finding out Sophie was bent.

596
00:37:28,634 --> 00:37:31,123
He was supposed to panic.
We were about to tip him off,

597
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,186
- but...
- I called him first.

598
00:37:37,514 --> 00:37:40,507
A guy with my rap
who stings corrupt millionaires.

599
00:37:41,035 --> 00:37:44,472
Winds up in a private prison
run by a corrupt millionaire?

600
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:47,216
I mean, how long did it take you
to put that together,

601
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,767
this wasn't just a jailbreak, was it?
It was an audition.

602
00:37:52,493 --> 00:37:54,147
You are as good as they say.

603
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,608
Possibly too good.

604
00:38:00,224 --> 00:38:01,866
I need you to take down...

605
00:38:04,424 --> 00:38:05,573
Damien Moreau.

606
00:38:06,832 --> 00:38:07,784
Damien Moreau?

607
00:38:08,178 --> 00:38:10,787
Are you out of your mind?
Nobody touches Moreau!

608
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:13,844
Moreau finances the Sicilians, the
Russian mafia, the Colombian cartels.

609
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:16,001
He moves money
for the North Koreans,

610
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:19,296
stolen artifacts for Iraq,
nuclear materials for Iran.

611
00:38:19,421 --> 00:38:20,881
Moreau is the big bad.

612
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,688
He is the central bank
for international crime.

613
00:38:23,813 --> 00:38:26,511
Nate, these files are CIA,
FBI, Mossad,

614
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,298
- Japanese Security.
- So...

615
00:38:29,576 --> 00:38:30,682
Who is this woman?

616
00:38:31,568 --> 00:38:33,060
You're not the police.

617
00:38:33,422 --> 00:38:34,724
I'n not the police.

618
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,648
Moreau buys the police.
He buys politicians.

619
00:38:38,888 --> 00:38:41,235
And no law enforcement
or intelligence agency

620
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:42,402
can touch him.

621
00:38:45,247 --> 00:38:48,306
You have six months
to take down Damien Moreau.

622
00:38:48,431 --> 00:38:50,391
She wants to hire us...

623
00:38:51,233 --> 00:38:53,239
- to go after Moreau?
- Absolutely not.

624
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,719
Just wait a second.
This is not a job.

625
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:02,441
If you bring me Damien Moreau,
you can walk away.

626
00:39:02,566 --> 00:39:04,287
And nobody will chase you.

627
00:39:17,806 --> 00:39:18,843
And if I fail?

628
00:39:19,932 --> 00:39:21,692
You can stay in my prison in Rome.

629
00:39:22,409 --> 00:39:24,396
Thick walls a thousand years old.

630
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:27,239
And we still use chain
for such a bad man.

631
00:39:28,384 --> 00:39:29,681
What about my team?

632
00:39:30,172 --> 00:39:31,773
They lead dangerous lives.

633
00:39:32,205 --> 00:39:33,759
Thieves die all the time.

634
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:39,564
Now that you should not have said.

635
00:39:41,071 --> 00:39:42,071
I don't know.

636
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:45,465
You seem highly motivated.

637
00:39:55,313 --> 00:39:56,996
She's blackmailing us?

638
00:39:58,749 --> 00:40:00,105
She's sort of...

639
00:40:03,613 --> 00:40:05,777
Sucks to be on the wrong side
of that, finally.

640
00:40:06,289 --> 00:40:09,736
Right now, they have the leverage, what
we have to do is we have to get it back.

641
00:40:13,943 --> 00:40:15,872
We can't go straight
at a guy like Moreau.

642
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,080
They'll vaporize us.

643
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:20,339
Right, so what we do is we do like
we've always done in the past,

644
00:40:20,464 --> 00:40:22,197
is we do jobs that help people.

645
00:40:22,322 --> 00:40:24,400
Only this time, some of them

646
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:26,781
are gonna lead us right to Moreau.

647
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:34,911
I do have a pretty big client
list waiting for us to check out.

648
00:40:41,143 --> 00:40:42,768
We back in business.

649
00:40:52,834 --> 00:40:54,446
How's that going for you?

650
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,789
This? Thanks for asking.
Yeah, it's good.

651
00:40:59,825 --> 00:41:02,501
When I realize that I tried being

652
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:04,370
a drunk honest man,

653
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:05,947
a sober thief, so...

654
00:41:06,427 --> 00:41:08,985
I'm gonna try being a drunk thief,
you know?

655
00:41:10,365 --> 00:41:11,676
Try that for a little while.

656
00:41:13,489 --> 00:41:15,703
You're not going to try to save me,
are you?

657
00:41:27,061 --> 00:41:28,334
You're a thief now.

658
00:41:29,631 --> 00:41:31,185
You can save yourself.

659
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,619
Whatever you say, Dominique.

660
00:41:41,268 --> 00:41:42,296
Caroline.

661
00:41:44,315 --> 00:41:45,293
Miriam.

662
00:41:46,526 --> 00:41:47,552
Raquel.

663
00:41:52,994 --> 00:41:54,091
I get it.
