1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,600
My sister and I

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,700
Began the reclamation
project 40 years ago.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,900
We recover art looted from

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,300
Nazi occupied countries
during the shoah.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,200
There is one piece in particular

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,000
That we have been trying
to recover for some time.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,200
It's a Gustav Klimt.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,800
I love the symbolists.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,300
It belonged to my father.

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,500
He smuggled it out just before...

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,400
the painting made it out of Europe.

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,100
He did not.

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,300
Mr. Ford,

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,000
I have searched my entire
life for that painting.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,800
Now we know it is here in Boston.

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,500
Oh, well, if it's on display, then
you can make a claim with the museum

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,900
- If you think you have provenance.
- It's on display...

18
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,500
but not in a museum.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,100
Mr. North bought the
painting on the black market

20
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,600
Knowing full well its history.

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,800
- He's got it hanging up in his office.
- Yeah.

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,200
We have tried every legal avenue,

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,900
But he even bribed a
judge to dismiss the case.

24
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,700
North owns the largest
software company in the state.

25
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,000
He has unlimited money
and twice as many lawyers.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Can you help us?

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,800
It's what we do.

28
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,600
Montgraft & Associates. One moment.

29
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,100
Can I help you?

30
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,100
Speak to the boss.

31
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,600
Yeah, uh, detective, uh, Marlowe.

32
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,400
This is detective Archer.

33
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,700
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah, we have a, uh, warrant here

34
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,700
To, uh, search your, uh, premises.

35
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,100
Your boss is a wanted man, young lady.

36
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,000
Close it up. I think
something's going on.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,800
I don't like this going through the
wrong office. It feels like cheating.

38
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,200
North is one of those guys who has the
latest everything, including security.

39
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,800
His office is one big mousetrap.

40
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,300
What, so instead we don't
even try? That's weak.

41
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,800
This is it. The Klimt is
behind the wall right here.

42
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,500
Mr. Montgraft is in
New York on business.

43
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,100
He probably skipped town.

44
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,100
Halfway to Canada by now.

45
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,900
No, he's supposed to be back tomorrow.

46
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,600
Yeah, well, no, he's not coming back.

47
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,300
And, uh, you better hope and
pray he doesn't come back.

48
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,200
You're just his type.

49
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,300
Oh, yeah.

50
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,900
What do you mean, "his type"?

51
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,000
Well...

52
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,400
It can't be that hard.

53
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,600
You crazy? The man has a pdx-500
rotating encryption system.

54
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,900
Rotating.

55
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,600
Do you even know what that is?

56
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,900
Some other crew might be crazy
enough to tackle that system head on,

57
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,600
But it's an impossible hack.

58
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
They would have to tap
the network directly

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,000
From a terminal inside the office.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,400
Even if they did get into the system,

61
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,800
They would only have three
minutes of access time

62
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,400
Before the encryption program
resets itself and locks them out.

63
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,800
Timer is set. Three
minutes and counting.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,100
I still think I could get in.

65
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,300
You're good, but nobody's that good.

66
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,500
In and out in under three
minutes is bad enough.

67
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,900
But north's office has a pressure sensitive
floor and thermal detectors

68
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,200
That operate under an
entirely different system.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,200
I guess cheating has its advantages.

70
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,100
It's easier to hack a wall than
a high tech security system.

71
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,000
And now the Klimt is ours.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,500
Did he ever express an interest in
the color of your toenail polish?

73
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,800
What? No.

74
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,600
Did he have wood chipper?

75
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,700
Did he ever ask you to come to his home

76
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,800
To see his wood chipper?

77
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
No.

78
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,300
We got a problem.

79
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,200
- What?
- At least we got a painting.

80
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,900
Maybe they won't notice the difference.

81
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,100
"Dogs playing poker"? Seriously?

82
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,900
Sophie?

83
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,200
Maybe he saw the magazine
photo and spooked.

84
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,800
The man bought holocaust
art on the black market

85
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,200
And hung it for display in his office.

86
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,900
You think he care if
anybody knows he's got it?

87
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,300
Guys, just a minute, all right?

88
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,300
We got beat. Somebody
beat us to the punch.

89
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,400
So I just got off the
phone with our clients.

90
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,600
Told them we couldn't recover
their dead father's painting.

91
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,200
Anyone want to explain why?

92
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,800
Where's Sophie? I'm on it.

93
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,900
Nazis!

94
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,200
Maybe they want the stuff
back that they stole.

95
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,200
You know? Secret Nazis.

96
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,400
It's going to voicemail.
I'm gonna try comms.

97
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,700
Sophie?

98
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,700
So--
Hey.

99
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,200
Nate wants to
know why you --

100
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,900
I'd say that's a pretty good reason.

101
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,600
How you doing?

102
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,100
Oh, you know.

103
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,300
Yep, that's a bomb.

104
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,100
I recognize that circuit.
It's motion triggered.

105
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,400
Any sudden movement's gonna
cause displacement of the water.

106
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,000
It'll set it off.

107
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,900
- Is that C4?
- Oh! Parker...

108
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,700
please don't poke at the
motion sensitive bomb.

109
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,700
So, uh... secret admirer?

110
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,200
Well, it's no secret they want me dead.

111
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,100
What do you think, man?

112
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,300
I'd have to reach into
the vase to disarm it.

113
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,700
It'd go off.

114
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,200
Well, let's not do that, then.

115
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,300
Do you have any instant pudding?

116
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,900
The powder hardens the liquid,

117
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,100
Tricks the bomb into
thinking it's not moving.

118
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,400
Should give you a little wiggle room.

119
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,100
- Very little.
- All right.

120
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,000
What's the plan, Eliot?

121
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,900
How fast can you run?

122
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,800
All right. Everybody get
out of here right now.

123
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm gonna stay. I'm gonna
stay with Sophie, all right?

124
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,500
We're not leaving you, Sophie.

125
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,300
Look, I appreciate what
you guys are trying to do,

126
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,100
But just -- If you don't
get out of here now,

127
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,500
Then -- Then I'm gonna kill
you myself when this is over.

128
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
So just...

129
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,800
just get out!

130
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,000
All right. Don't throw it up in the air.

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,900
The device will hit the
bottom and it'll go off.

132
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,000
Just let go and drop it.

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,300
Okay.

134
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,100
You too. Go on.

135
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,300
No, I'm staying. I'm staying right here.

136
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,600
Listen, it's gonna be
fine, Nate. You know me.

137
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,200
Sophie.

138
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,300
Please.

139
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,700
Do it exactly the way he said.

142
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,000
She had a way of taking
care of people, you know?

143
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
She was a sister...

144
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,700
she was best friend...

145
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,100
all rolled into one.

146
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,800
I'm gonna miss
you, Soph--

147
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,300
So-O-O-O-O
much, Katherine.

148
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,900
Katherine and I have
known each other forever.

149
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,600
Almost two years.

150
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,400
Yeah, I know that probably
doesn't sound like a lot to you,

151
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,600
But it is to me.

152
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,200
I never really had many friends.

153
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,800
Which is why losing her is so hard.

154
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,500
It's so creepy.

155
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,600
I mean, she's really dead.

156
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,100
I was just talking to her and
now she's just laying there.

157
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,800
- She was just laying there. Can you hear me?
- Parker

158
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,600
I'm -- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, y'all.

159
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,100
What -- What
she really means

160
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,100
Is just, um, Katherine was like family.

161
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,300
And sometimes, friends are
all the family that you have.

162
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,300
So... you
-- You good?

163
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,800
Come on. Just -- Let
-- Just keep going.

164
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,000
You got all hysterical and emotional.

165
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,500
See any suspects?

166
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,000
No one jumps out at me.

167
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,900
Me neither.

168
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,400
What makes you so sure
they're gonna show up?

169
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,700
Listen, when you go through the trouble of
killing someone the likes of a Sophie Devereaux,

170
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,700
You make sure they're dead.

171
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,500
Not much of a turnout, is it?

172
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,000
Jesus. You're dead. You're
not supposed to care.

173
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,200
I mean, is this it? Huh?

174
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,400
Buried in a stranger's
grave, hardly any mourners.

175
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,900
- It's not you.
- It is me.

176
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,700
Well, at least, it's the
me that anybody knows.

177
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,900
Yeah, listen, Kat, you
got to get out of here.

178
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,000
You're gonna blow the con.

179
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
No. It's fine. No one's
gonna recognize me.

180
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,200
How's that?

181
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,000
Nate, I'm acting.

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,300
The lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

183
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,400
It's a shame, really.

184
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,500
So beautiful, so...young.

185
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,900
You know her well?

186
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,200
Yeah, we were friends a long time.

187
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,500
I'm sorry for your loss.

188
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,300
Yours, too.
How do you --

189
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,700
How did you know Katherine?

190
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,500
Katherine?

191
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,600
When we knew each other,

192
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,400
She, um... she went by a different name.

193
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,700
Actresses.

194
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:24,200
I suppose we should take
something to heart from this.

195
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,300
Mistakes can get you killed.

196
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,900
It was an accident.

197
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,400
Gas line broke.

198
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,200
That is the story. Right.

199
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,700
And now let us be
comforted by the words of...

200
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,200
lets get out of here.

201
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,400
Friend of yours?

202
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,300
Well, if by that you mean

203
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,500
Murderous, treacherous
backstabber, then yes.

204
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,800
Yeah, I thought so.
Seemed like your type.

205
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,500
What are you doing?

206
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Security-Camera footage
from Sophieís apartment.

207
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,200
Trying to see who delivered the bomb,

208
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,500
But with nothing for reference, facial
recognition can't narrow it down.

209
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,200
No need.

210
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,700
I know exactly who's to blame.

211
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,000
Marcus Starke.

212
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,300
Brilliant grifter, even better forger.

213
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Stop it.

214
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,200
It's like you're haunting us.

215
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
Parker, I'm not really dead.

216
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
- I'm not dead!
- Okay.

217
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,700
We used to work together.

218
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,900
We did the Copenhagen job in '97,

219
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,500
The Berlin Polytech job in '98,

220
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,300
And, Nate, remember -- Remember
that great run in Moscow?

221
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,600
"That great run"?

222
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,900
I chased you for three months.

223
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,400
Well, uh, technically, you chased us.

224
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,800
Sorry.

225
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,200
Are you saying that you
saw other teams before us?

226
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,300
Really just another Nate before Nate.

227
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,300
Let me ask you a question
-- What bugs you more,

228
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,900
Is it the fact that he
was with Sophie first

229
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,800
Or that he outsmarted you?

230
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,600
Moving on.

231
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,000
Starke doesn't keep a permanent crew.

232
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,200
He specializes in whiz mobs.

233
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,100
He puts a team together,

234
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,600
They slam into town for
one high profile job,

235
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,700
And then they scatter.

236
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,100
...73, it's a white...

237
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,600
but usually
they do one same--

238
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,100
They do one smaller job first

239
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,700
Just to work out the kinks in the team.

240
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,500
Like our clients' painting, for example.

241
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,000
Wrong place, wrong time.

242
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,900
Starke must have seen me,

243
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,400
And now that I'm one of the good guys,

244
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,500
Decided to get rid of me, because...why?

245
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,800
Because...

246
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,000
because I know his scams.

247
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,700
Because... I know his favorite scam.

248
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,400
CafÈ and a moonlit terrace..

249
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,100
- The Mona Lisa variant.
- There are security... oooh!

250
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,800
That was the first one I learned.

251
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,900
In 1911 the Mona Lisa was stolen.

252
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,200
And the con man who did it
made six identical copies.

253
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,000
And then they put them
on the black market,

254
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,600
And each buyer thought
that they had the original.

255
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,500
So dude sold the same
painting six times.

256
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,100
- Yep.
- Hardison,

257
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,700
Pull up all the auctions in
Boston in the next two days.

258
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,700
Starke never stays in a
city more than two days.

259
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,700
Wait a minute.
Not -- Not museums?

260
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,000
No, no.

261
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,400
Starke likes to use auctions

262
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,000
To figure out who wants the painting.

263
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,800
He picks who he's
gonna sell the fakes to.

264
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,000
That bit was actually
my part of the scam.

265
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,300
I made that up.

266
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,900
It's good, isn't it?

267
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,900
That's still a lot of paintings.

268
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah, it's high-Profile.

269
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,600
A scam like this requires
a lot of publicity,

270
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,300
Paintings $10 million or more.

271
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,900
He does all his
own forgeries --

272
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,700
Post impressionists, late 1800s.

273
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,800
There. That's it.

274
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,200
Van Gogh.

275
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,800
He has a soft spot for van Gogh.

276
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,300
Let's just make it five.

277
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,000
And that is the Mona Lisa scam.

278
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,700
So we just -- We call the
cops. We have them show up.

279
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,400
No. Starke goes down for this,

280
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,800
There's no guarantee we can get
that painting back for the Mercers.

281
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,500
He even smells the
police, and he's gonna run,

282
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,800
And we'll get nowhere near it.

283
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,500
He did try to kill you, Sophie.

284
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,200
We risk our lives all the time. I...

285
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,500
no. We need to barter.

286
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,500
We need something to trade
for the Mercers' painting.

287
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,300
Such as?

288
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,100
That.

289
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,600
That's what he's come for.

290
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,700
That's what he wants.

291
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,400
We just got to get there first.

292
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,800
Okay, parker. Talk to me.

293
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,200
Present.

294
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,500
How we doing?

295
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,600
What's going on
security wise at this place?

296
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,700
Well...

297
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,500
the usual countermeasures.
Nothing we can't handle.

298
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,200
Actually, I'm more of a jack man myself,

299
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,600
But when in Rome...

300
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,800
thank you, sweetheart. Uh-Huh.

301
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,600
I wish Sophie was here.

302
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,300
She's the one who likes to
play all this dress up stuff.

303
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,800
I miss her.

304
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,200
I'm not dead. I'm right here, Parker.

305
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,300
So, this is, um...

306
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:50,900
it's what you do, right?

307
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,500
You take footage of us on
cons and you -- You -- You --

308
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,800
Download it into that?

309
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,900
Yeah, I analyze it, I monitor comms,

310
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,800
I scan for a police
frequencies, I --

311
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,700
You had no idea I do all this, did you?

312
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,400
Well -- Do--Does
nobody respect the van?

313
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
The van is important.
What -- What is that?

314
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,200
It's lemon zest tea.

315
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,300
I got to tell you, it's
-- It's a little bit --

316
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,500
It's a little bit whiffy in here.

317
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,300
It smells like hard work.
That's what it smells like.

318
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,800
D--
Whiffy.

319
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,200
Okay, guys, I've got the
auction house manager in sight.

320
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,500
Now, if you take his wallet and badge,

321
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,200
It should be a cakewalk.

322
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,900
Eliot, check out the back corridor.

323
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,900
I think I see an access point.

324
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,600
That was some nice things
you said at my funeral.

325
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Wait.

326
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,700
We -- We trust Nate to
make sure the plan works.

327
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:45,500
We trust you to make sure
we're all ok.

328
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,400
It's a blind spot in the
cameras if you can find it.

329
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,600
Hello?

330
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,500
Hello?

331
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
Who is this?

332
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,600
Oh, I probably shouldn't, but I will.

333
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,200
Got the badge. Just
need to get the wallet.

334
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,900
I said, "who is this?"

335
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,100
Hey. Uh...

336
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,600
you are bumping into my
baby monitor frequency,

337
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,200
So what I'm gonna need you to do,

338
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,000
'Cause little Shiloh
needs to take a nap,

339
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,600
Is turn yours off, 'kay? Thanks.

340
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,200
Your baby is incredibly intelligent.

341
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,100
He just attempted to launch a
multiple variant computer worm

342
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,300
At my baby monitor's firewall.

343
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,600
Guys, we have a visiting team.

344
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Switching to backup comm frequencies.

345
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,700
Eliot, they're here. They're here.

346
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,700
Who are you talking about? Who's here?

347
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,200
Excuse me. Waiter?

348
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,400
Yes, sir.

349
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,800
Hardison, what do
you mean? Who's --

350
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,700
Who's?

351
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,700
Nathan Ford.

352
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,500
I -- I cannot believe I didn't
recognize you at the funeral.

353
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,900
Of course, I was blinded by grief.

354
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,300
Guilty conscience?

355
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,300
Call them off.

356
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,100
Not gonna happen.

357
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,300
You best clear out.

358
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,200
No speak English?

359
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,100
Good to see you. Have a nice night.

360
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,300
My phone.

361
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,600
He got my phone!

362
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,500
Word is on the street that
you run the nastiest crew

363
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
This side of the Atlantic.

364
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,100
Well what?

365
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,300
Come on. Everybody knows.

366
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,600
You robbed a bank and
you -- You framed a judge.

367
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,000
You rigged a jury to steal
a million dollar settlement.

368
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,600
I hear that you even
conned the Irish mob

369
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,000
Out of a couple of million
dollars just this year.

370
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,300
Now, that's style.

371
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,200
That's one way of looking at it.

372
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,600
Nate, if you tell him the
truth about us, we're blown.

373
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,000
You cannot tell him about our clients

374
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,300
Or about us helping people --
He's gonna use that against us.

375
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,000
If you know about us,

376
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,400
Then you would know
to get out of my city.

377
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,800
It's still your city, Nate.

378
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,900
I'm -- I'm just
gonna take her out

379
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,300
For one night of cheap fun.

380
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,300
I'll get her back to you in the morning.

381
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,500
I know this style. This is chaos.

382
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,600
Chaos.

383
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,300
I heard you were in
jail. Guess I was wrong.

384
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,600
Hardison. I heard you sucked.

385
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,100
Guess I was right.

386
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,800
Hardison!

387
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,800
I seem to have lost my wallet.

388
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,100
Where's my I.D. Card?

389
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,500
Folks, uh, we're gonna
close a little early today.

390
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,100
We appreciate you attending the gallery,

391
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,400
And if you could please head
toward the exits at this time,

392
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,500
I'd appreciate it.

393
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,000
Thank you very much.

394
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,100
I want the security
detail tripled tonight.

395
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,000
Call the police.

396
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,600
I want a patrol car
drive by every 10 minutes.

397
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,100
Are these motion sensors ready?

398
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,000
We haven't tested them.

399
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,900
Turn them on. I want
everything in lockdown.

400
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,200
Your people blew it.

401
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,900
Uh, my people never make mistakes.

402
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,700
What about Sophie?

403
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,600
Is that a warning?

404
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,000
Take it how you want.

405
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,500
Let's go.

406
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,200
Okay, now, we know Starke.

407
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,400
This guy goes by the name Apollo.

408
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,800
I've chased him a
couple of times --

409
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,200
Infiltration, physical security.

410
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,100
People in that line of high risk
work tend to be very unstable.

411
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,600
We could use that. Write that down.

412
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,900
Now, this person here's
ex-Mossad, sealed records.

413
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,200
Raquel Diane used to work
both sides as a mercenary.

414
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,500
Raquel Diane. I know that name.

415
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,600
You were scared to fight a girl.

416
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,700
She'd mop the floor with
you, Hardison. I don't care.

417
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,200
Seriously. She actually
killed a guy once with a mop.

418
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,000
It's a funny story, actually.
She broke the mop and took --

419
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,800
Eliot. Eliot.

420
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
Now, this here's Colin Mason,

421
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,200
Otherwise known by his
hacker handle as "chaos."

422
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,000
As...whatever.

423
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,500
Hacked the pentagon, the NSA.

424
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,800
The CIA computer guys call
him the Kobayashi Maru.

425
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,900
- What the hell is that?
- None of y'all got that? Seriously?

426
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,600
- Star Trek.
- Thank you.

427
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,200
How's this gonna play out?

428
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,700
He's been challenged, okay?

429
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,800
His -- His pride's hurt.
His -- His ego's at stake.

430
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
He's --
He's gonna --

431
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,400
He's gonna come up with
a bigger, riskier plan.

432
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
Are you talking about Nate?

433
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,100
- Nate, yeah.
- There's no way...

434
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,900
There's no way this crew is gonna get
to that painting before we do -- No way.

435
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,500
We're not giving up on our only
hope of helping the Mercers.

436
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,400
They've waited their
entire lives for justice,

437
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,400
And we're not gonna fail them now.

438
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,500
Yeah, yeah. That. Sure. Yeah.

439
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,600
- But, I mean, who does this guy...
- Think he is?

440
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,900
Nathan Ford, that's who.

441
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,000
Hey, what did he say
about Sophie Devereaux?

442
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,800
Did you kill her?

443
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,100
Don't listen to that. Come on.

444
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,000
We fooled them the first time.

445
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,600
We didn't even know they were there.

446
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,600
This time, we know their
names, we know their...

447
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,100
M.O., we know their
strengths, weaknesses.

448
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,400
No, no, no. I have noticed a
distinct lack of weaknesses.

449
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,700
We know their target, and even
better, we know their timeline.

450
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,100
That painting's going
up for auction tomorrow,

451
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,100
And it gets sold, it
walks out that door.

452
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,900
- That means they have to hit it...
- Tonight.

453
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,100
Now, we've been working
on this for weeks.

454
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,300
We got to go in hot, in
and out before they even --

455
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,300
Tripled security
since today --

456
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,100
We barely had time to check out
the cameras, the motion sensors.

457
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,000
Whatever happens, one way or another,

458
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
We are walking out of
that auction house tonight

459
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,300
With that painting, no matter what.

460
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,900
We are gonna get that painting.

461
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,900
No matter what.

462
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,000
Got it?

463
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,500
Got it.

464
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,900
Got it.

465
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,000
Good.

466
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
You got it?

467
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,700
Yeah.

468
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,600
Now...

469
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,400
let's go steal...
ourselves a masterpiece.

470
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,400
Okay. Cameras, all check.

471
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,600
Motion sensors active.

472
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,400
We'll fire up the lasers after patrol.

473
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,500
Head out.

474
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,300
And that's a steal by...

475
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,600
game on.

476
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,700
The security cameras are spoofed.

477
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,600
They don't see anything
until we want them to.

478
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,900
Motion sensors?

479
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,300
I'm still working on those.

480
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:33,200
Yeah, well, work faster.
Sophie, are you in position?

481
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,700
I don't think I've driven in
the front of one of these before.

482
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:50,200
Emily!

483
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,100
- Sir.
- Let me in!

484
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,400
What are you doing?

485
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,900
I'm here to see Emily.

486
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,000
There's no Emily here.

487
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
What?
Wait, sh--

488
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,900
She moved?

489
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,000
Emily...

490
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,400
Hah hah

491
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,700
I tried to say to her
I'm sorry and I don't --

492
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,200
Because, as men, we're
taught to hide our emotions.

493
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,100
You share or you pay the price.

494
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,400
Yeah.

495
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,100
Next left, two intersections.

496
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,100
Okay, the gallery room
should be directly below --

497
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,900
Uh -- Uh-Oh. Wait.
F-Freeze. Freeze.

498
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,900
"Uh-Oh?"

499
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,400
That's not what I want to hear.

500
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,200
One of the motion sensors triggered.

501
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,800
Motion sensors triggered.
Call the secur--

502
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,500
Oh, man!

503
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,100
A bird got in here.

504
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,500
Turn off all the motion sensors
until we can get this damn thing.

505
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
A bird?

506
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
How did
a bird --

507
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,000
Uh-Oh.

508
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,600
What's with all the "uh-ohs"?

509
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,100
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?

510
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,300
I have the cameras now, Hardison.

511
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,700
Now I have the cameras
and the motion sensors.

512
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,300
No...

513
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,000
I have the cameras
and the motion sensors.

514
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,400
Look!

515
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,500
I also have the lasers.

516
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,600
On the right side for
a 3-Pointer. No good.

517
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,700
It's off the back of the rim.

518
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,200
And Watson ends up with
it on the long rebound.

519
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,000
Those motion sensors
going off, that was weird.

520
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,400
Go home. Sleep it off, bro.

521
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,600
We should go hit the main gallery.

522
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,400
No, wait -- W-W--
J-Just maybe wait.

523
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,200
What is going on, guys?

524
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,900
Motion sensors went off, sir.

525
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,300
I already checked that
out. Everything's secure.

526
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,000
And who's this?

527
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Uh... he just got lost. No problem.

528
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,700
Sir, you okay?

529
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,800
Yeah, I'm fine.

530
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,200
I'm Nathan Ford. I'm with
the insurance company.

531
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,800
Can I help you?

532
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,900
Why don't we just walk
over here, sir? Come on.

533
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,900
I got this.

534
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,200
What kind of bird did you use?

535
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,900
North American Kestrel.

536
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,600
It's small bodied, but its
wingspan is expansive enough

537
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,700
That it sets off the motion detectors.

538
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,900
I would've gone with
the Scarlet Tanger.

539
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,500
Similar wingspan, but the brighter
colors are more distracting.

540
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,500
Yeah. That was my second choice.

541
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,400
That's the wrong way.

542
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,600
You're going to come out on
the wrong side of the room!

543
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,700
Go! Your exit is directly
above that painting!

544
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,400
So I told them, I'm with
the insurance company,

545
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,500
You know, to help smooth things over.

546
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,400
They were just super helpful.

547
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,500
All right.

548
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,100
Blueprints, security codes. Great guys.

549
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,600
And now the lasers.

550
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,800
Goodnight, Hardison.

551
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,100
P-P-Parker, the
lasers are on! Freeze!

552
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,500
Nate, he locked me out.

553
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,200
He has total control of security.

554
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,400
Parker?

555
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,200
Can't move.

556
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,900
Eliot?

557
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,000
Eliot?!

558
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,000
You all out of tricks, Nate?

559
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,100
You all out of tricks, Nate?

560
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,500
Oh, I think he has one more.

561
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,100
Sophie?

562
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,000
You're not...

563
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,800
dead, yes.

564
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,400
You went through all
this just to set me up?

565
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,500
Mnh-Mnh. No.

566
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,700
We went through all of this to save you.

567
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,900
No, no.

568
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,000
Stay down.

569
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,600
Now, Hardison.

570
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,900
Can't hack a classic.

571
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,700
A gun?

572
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,100
- Don't move!
- What are you doing?

573
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,700
I got him! He's in here!

574
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,100
Get down.

575
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,800
Not me. Him.

576
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,200
When the hell did the cops get here?

577
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,800
The police are outside!

578
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,100
Come on!

579
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,200
Guys, guys.

580
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,600
This woman claims she's a cop.

581
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,000
Uh, yeah. They're parked outside.

582
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,200
There you are.

583
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,500
Back up is checking the roof.

584
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,300
All right, good. I'm gonna
have this dusted for prints.

585
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,600
Okay.

586
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,800
Caught another one down in the air vents

587
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,600
With this rope and climbing gear.

588
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,400
Come on.

589
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,700
Quick thinking, what you did,

590
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,900
Setting off all the alarms like that.

591
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,000
You're gonna be heroes.

592
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Yeah, well, that's what they pay us for.

593
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,600
They should pay you
more. You are my hero.

594
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,500
Guys, you are the salt
of the earth, seriously.

595
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,300
You are the red in the red cross

596
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,600
And in the red, white, and blue.

597
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,800
I got to go.

598
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,700
All right. Back to your
posts. Come on. Let's go.

599
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,100
This is saving me how?

600
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,400
Well, at first,

601
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,900
I thought it was you
that sent me that bomb

602
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,500
To keep me from ruining
this gig for you,

603
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,600
But then you said something to Nate.

604
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,400
Word on the street is

605
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,900
That you run the nastiest
crew this side of he Atlantic.

606
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,900
No reason to put a bomb
in Sophieís apartment

607
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,300
If you thought she was still a thief.

608
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,400
Well, of course she's still a thief.

609
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,900
She's Sophie Devereaux.

610
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,300
You know, I wanted to
recruit you for this gig.

611
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,000
Did you tell anyone else

612
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,200
That you wanted to
invite me to the party?

613
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,600
Yeah, my
-- My...

614
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,800
my crew.

615
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,200
And, you know, once Hardison got
decent pictures of all of them,

616
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,300
Well, you know, the
rest was, uh, was easy.

617
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,000
It's a match, baby.

618
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,700
Yeah.

619
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,500
I knew that she was trouble

620
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,300
From the second you said her name!

621
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,200
Now, why would you want to kill Sophie?

622
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,000
Come on, Starke.

623
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,500
I had set up the perfect double cross,

624
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,100
And then you want to go
and bring in a new player

625
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,100
At the last minute?

626
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,200
"Oh, and by the way, guys,

627
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,200
That new player is gonna
be Sophie Devereaux."

628
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,300
There's no way I'm gonna try
to out con Sophie Devereaux!

629
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,200
And I hate to break it to you, Starke,

630
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,100
But she was the one that
everybody was always scared of.

631
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,600
It was never you.

632
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,200
I've got a feeling there's a bomb

633
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,600
Very similar to the one they sent me

634
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,500
Waiting for you your getaway car.

635
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,900
Sophie, come on. I'm not an amateur.

636
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,100
I'm not gonna let a keyboard
monkey like that con me.

637
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,000
Where is your car?

638
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,600
And if we hadn't come along,

639
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,700
When, exactly, do you think
you'd be getting in it?

640
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,800
Well, right about...

641
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,900
why, that little son of a bitch!

642
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,900
I don't think he's
your problem now. I am.

643
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,100
Well, what do you want?

644
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,200
A deal.

645
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,900
Yes. Your people in trade for the first
painting you stole, the Gustav Klimt.

646
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,400
Do I look like Moses?
They're not my people.

647
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,400
Your reputation will be ruined.

648
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,000
Starke gets his whole team busted.

649
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,300
So much for the mastermind.

650
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,200
No one's ever gonna work with you again.

651
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,100
And, of course, to top it all off,

652
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,200
We do have the, uh, van
Gogh that you came for.

653
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,800
Oh, well...I mean...

654
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,100
I'll trade you for that.

655
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:04,000
You really do run the nastiest
crew this side of the Atlantic.

656
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,800
- We'll be in touch.
- Yes, you will.

657
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,000
So, who's Emily, then?

658
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,300
Eighth grade. I was crazy about her.

659
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,500
Little temptress, huh?

660
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Oh, you could say that, I guess.

661
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,100
Go.

662
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
I can top that.

663
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,200
Frag grenade, somalia.

664
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,300
Myanmar.

665
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,300
Sniper.

666
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,400
I was a sniper in Myanmar for a while.

667
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,200
- When?
- 2003.

668
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,500
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no. We can't have that.

669
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,200
Handcuffs. Y'all nasty.

670
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,600
So, when I heard this painting
belonged to somebody else,

671
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,900
I was so, uh...

672
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,500
- dismayed?
- So...

673
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,100
uh... more, um, shocked. Shocked, maybe?

674
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,000
Shocked.

675
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,100
Uh, my associates and I just
decided we had to return it.

676
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,200
- Oh, God bless you!
- That's okay.

677
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,000
Thank you.

678
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,200
- Thank you.
- God bless you.

679
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,800
Enough of the hugging.

680
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:35,300
After 70 years, to see justice done...

681
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,700
you are a fine man.

682
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,900
So...where's mine?

683
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,400
You know, the Sophie
Devereaux I knew --

684
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,400
She'd never waste her time like this.

685
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,800
What happened to her?

686
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,800
Well...

687
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,500
she died, remember?

688
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,700
Come on.

689
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,300
It wasn't so bad being the good guy.

690
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,900
Oh, please.

691
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,100
You ran a couple of cons,

692
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,200
You committed about 12
felonies trying to blackmail me,

693
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,400
And you handed over a stolen masterpiece

694
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,900
Just to get what you wanted.

695
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,500
You're still thieves.

696
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,300
And in the end, I still win.

697
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,100
You did give him one of
the fakes, didn't you?

698
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,000
Yes, of course.

699
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,100
He got my phone!

700
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,100
Go, go! Go!

701
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,200
Thanks for letting us use the real one.

702
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,900
Yeah. I hate loose ends.

703
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,900
Listen, I don't mean to be rude,

704
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,200
But my flight to Paris
leaves in 10 minutes.

705
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,100
No problem, sir.

706
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,500
Routine question about
your checked baggage.

707
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,800
Oh, okay, great.

708
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,000
Wait. Um, I don't have
any checked baggage, so...

709
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
that's your name, isn't it?

710
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,000


711
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,600
That--

712
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,700
I, um... I...

713
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,600
Starke was right.

714
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,400
I'm not Sophie Devereaux anymore.

715
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,000
I haven't been for ages. I...

716
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,200
you killed her, you
and your silly crusade.

717
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,500
- It's just a name.
- No, they're not just names, not to me.

718
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,400
All my aliases, every
one of them, I --

719
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,900
I know when their parents died.

720
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,400
I know when they had their first kiss.

721
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,700
- I --
- Sophie.

722
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,700
You're the closest thing I've
ever had to a real friend,

723
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:25,100
And I've never heard
you say my real name.

724
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,400
How sad is that?

725
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,300
So tell me.

726
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:42,000
Let me -- Let me finish
burying Sophie first.

727
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,700
Finish burying the rest of them...

728
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,400
until all that's left is me.

729
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,900
Just me.

730
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:03,400
And how long will that take?

731
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:34,400
