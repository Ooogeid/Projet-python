1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,200
Where are they?

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,500
Clear the room. Clear the room!

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,700
Are you here to kill me, ian?

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,100
Before we conclude this meeting,

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,300
I want to introduce to you the newest vice
president of i.Y.S. Insurance,

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,000
James sterling.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,600
All of you know jim sterling
as our chief investigator,

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,500
The man who recovered a michelangelo
that was stolen from me three months ago.

9
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,200
But that's not the reason
he's standing here now.

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,300
It certainly didn't hurt.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,100
Leverage s01 e13

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,100
That's right. Yeah, i'm at the museum.

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,100
I'll be home around 6:00. Uh-Huh.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,600
<Font color="#ffff00>capture:frm@Ô‰∑Á
sync:frs@ª® </font>

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,500
Uh, no, no. I'll, uh, i'll fix them
something to eat when i get home.

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:10,500
<Font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.Com presents</font>

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,800
So, what i'm proposing is that we both insure

18
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,300
And secure our clients' art --

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,800
Ourpersonnel,ourtechnology.

20
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,400
No more writing multimillion-Dollar checks

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,700
Because some museum guard
took a nap under the picasso.

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,300
The showcase will be my wing of the museum.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,900
Every painting there will be either mine or
belong to a high-Profile client of i.Y.S.

24
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,100
A perfect show of faith.

25
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,000
Thank you for your vote of confidence.

26
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,200
So, what do you think?

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,700
Corner office. I don't know what to say.

28
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,600
How about, uh...

29
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:25,400
Something like, "i'm more comfortable
in enclosed spaces"?

30
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,800
- Let's take a look over here.
- Okay.

31
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,700
You know, i think you'd fit through that window
if you're traveling fast enough.

32
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,500
Last time i saw you,
you were selling me something.

33
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,000
It's a nice team you had, by the way.
Uh, portia -- Was that her name?

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,600
Oh, i mean sophie.

35
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,300
Yes. Yes, thank you. I got out of sales.

36
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,300
- So, what are you in now?
- Theft.

37
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,600
Yeah, i'm going to rob the two davids gallery
on opening day.

38
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,900
Nice wet bar.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,100
Aren't you gonna call the, uh, police?

40
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,800
Of course not. You're a sick man, nathan.

41
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,300
You still blame me
for the death of your son.

42
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,600
You turned down the insurance claim for
the treatment that would've saved him.

43
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,200
It's our policy to say no to all claims
until they've been fully investigated.

44
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,400
Stalled -- Fully stalled.

45
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't let my personal feelings
affect policy.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,500
Yourpolicy.

47
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,900
This company never automatically
turned down claims until you came along.

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,100
I have a responsibility
to my shareholders.

49
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,000
- People lost their homes! Children died!
- No exceptions.

50
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,900
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

51
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,100
- Get out. You're gonna mess thisup.
- You're gonna mess meup.

52
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,300
- I was here first.
- I was here first!

53
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,600
What are you doing?

54
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,500
- Damn it hardison!
- This is my spot. You go!

55
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,200
I'm gonna make you an offer. One time only.

56
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,800
You resign as c.E.O., you donate
all your assets to charity,

57
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,400
And i will not rob the museum.

58
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,700
- All my assets?
- Yeah.

59
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
How generous.

60
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,600
We're done here.

61
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,900
Yeah, i've got some errands, too.

62
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,000
Rope, masks...knockout gas!

63
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,200
- Be seeing you, sterling.
- Nate.

64
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,300
Behind you.

65
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
- What? What?!
- Behind you!

66
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,800
- What?
- Hey!

67
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,400
???

68
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,000
Hey!

69
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,600
Hey.

70
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,800
Just wait. Hey!

71
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,100
Are you seeing this?

72
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,300
Could we get some security
over to the blackpoole gallery?

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,200
Help me.

74
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,100
I got it. I got it.

75
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,400
I'm sorry. Do i know you?

76
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Lo siento. No habla ingles.

77
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,700
Perdon.Le conozco?

78
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,800
Of course she bloody speaks spanish.

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,300
????

80
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,100
Hey. All right, check one floor up. I think
i saw another guy dressed just like this one.

81
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,400
- Got it.Let's go.
- Move!

82
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,900
I'm gonna kick your butt.

83
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,300
- Stand over there!
- I'm gonna kick your butt.

84
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,600
Oh! W- Where did you --

85
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Run now. Talk later.

86
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,400
- What?
- Let's go.

87
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,600
Need a ride?

88
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,100
Hardison, what is this?

89
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,500
Yeah, well, since sterling blew our covers,
i had to find a new safe house.

90
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,600
Lay low.

91
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,400
This is your idea of laying low?

92
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,300
- Hey, don't break nothing.
- There's nothing to break.

93
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,900
Who ripped out the toilets?

94
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,300
This was an i.R.S. Foreclosure.
I got it cheap.

95
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,700
I.R.S. Doesn't take toilets.

96
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,200
They do when they're solid gold.
This used to be m.C. Hammer's place.

97
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,100
I guess youcan touch this --With
a swat team and a federal warrant.

98
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,300
What?

99
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,100
See that?

100
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,300
We're a mess.

101
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,100
Yep.

102
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,700
How'd you know we'd be there?

103
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,900
Last week before the exhibit opens,
security almost in place,

104
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,400
But not fully staffed. Best time
to case the joint.

105
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,400
Plus, i did chase all of you
at one point or another.

106
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,600
Is she in on this?

107
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,400
"She" can hear you, okay?

108
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
Wait a minute. There is no "this," eliot.

109
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,300
Sophie did come back for me.

110
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,300
Wouldn't have had to if
she wouldn't have lied to you.

111
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,300
No calls for three months.
I don't need you people.

112
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,100
???

113
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,300
??A certain job with horses where
i backed your play, actually.

114
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,900
I don't care! You don't con your crew!

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,100
Glen-Reeder security system here.

116
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,500
And that's not the worst of it.

117
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,800
The davids are under bulletproof glass
on a motion-Detector pad.

118
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,800
- Really?
- Mm-Hmm.

119
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Environmentally sealed, kept at a constant
temperature and humidity in the case.

120
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,700
I saw them working on the airflow.

121
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,900
You can get past the motion detectors, okay?

122
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,300
I have a link to their security
system and the video feed.

123
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,800
Guard rotation's too heavy
for a day grab,

124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,300
And at night they got
two standing guards.

125
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,900
Why'd you come back?

126
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,800
We agreed to scatter for six months.

127
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,700
All of you -- Allof you --

128
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,800
Made an amateur move being there.

129
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,500
It's too hard to leave a job undone.
It's like an itch.

130
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,300
I put a lot of work into us,
into that office.

131
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,200
It was like my second home.
I blew up my second home.

132
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,700
As annoying as you people are,

133
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,800
I quit this crew when i quit this crew.
Nobody makes me leave.

134
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,100
I just -- I really
wanted to hurt sterling.

135
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Well, he's taking over security
for the gallery.

136
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,100
So if we work together --
If we work together,

137
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,100
We can kill two birds
with one stone --

138
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,100
Break blackpoole
and humiliate sterling.

139
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,500
No, no. Sterling, he knows
our game, man, okay?

140
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,900
It's going to be twice as hard
to steal those statues.

141
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,300
Oh, no, no. It'll be four times as hard.

142
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,500
They know we're coming.

143
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,500
And how do they know that?

144
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,200
I went to their office and told them.

145
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,900
Oh, nate.

146
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,700
We all want to hurt these guys, right?
They humiliated us.

147
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,000
But taunting them? The -- The response
is going to be...

148
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,400
Biblical.

149
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,000
That's what i'm counting on.

150
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,400
Hey, i think the roof's the way in.

151
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,300
But it looks like they've rigged
alarm sensors to the skylights.

152
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,800
- I can get around those.
- Really?

153
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,600
And end up on one of the new 20
cameras they got down there

154
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,700
From our last little trip
to the basement?

155
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,100
That was fun.

156
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,800
- Yeah. Could we talk about that?
- Talk about what?

157
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,300
You know, none of this takes into account
any new security measures

158
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,900
That sterling might have added
since nate made his little playdate.

159
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,300
Where's the air coming from?

160
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
The statues are in a sealed case,

161
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,100
Kept at a constant humidity
and temperature.

162
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,400
Air moves in and out. How?

163
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,900
All right, from what i saw,

164
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,400
The airflow to the museum passes through
the base of the display, right?

165
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,100
Hollow base underneath the statues,
so what's underneath the base?

166
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,500
The restoration room. It's like
a maze of rooms down there --

167
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,000
Airflow control, heating, storage.

168
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,200
How'd we miss that?

169
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,400
Grifter, hitter, hacker, thief.

170
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,800
You were all trying to solve
your version of the crime

171
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,500
Instead of just trying to...
solve the crime.

172
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
There was a reason we worked together.

173
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,200
Yeah...was.

174
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Okay, we need access
to that restoration room.

175
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,200
We need somebody on the inside.

176
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,600
We can't run a con. They know our faces.

177
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,900
What about maggie?

178
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,400
Exactly. I mean, most of the museum people
aren't gonna recognize us,

179
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,000
But maggie --She works down there.

180
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,300
No -- What about maggie?
She's inside.

181
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,700
- You just said that.She just said --
- No, wait.No, hold -- Listen.

182
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,400
Listen, i get -- I get it.

183
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,100
Just have eliot call her as dr. Sinclair.
We won't play her. He'll just feel her out.

184
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,000
Have eliot...feel out my wife?

185
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,000
Feelout.

186
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,800
Ex,nate -- Ex-Wife.

187
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,900
Okay, look, you always
have a plan "b," right?

188
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,900
So, fine. Without maggie,
what's the plan "b"?

189
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,500
I'm sorry. These allergies -- They're
just killing me this year.

190
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,700
So, we moved the sarcophagus from
the egyptian room to the lecture hall.

191
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It still needs to be validated.

192
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,600
Ah. Jim.

193
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,700
This is dr. Lloyd, director of the museum.
And you know maggie.

194
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:49,000
Mr. Sterling will be taking over
all the security for blackpoole gallery.

195
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,800
I want that floor to ceiling,
all four floors.

196
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,800
You know, we, uh, we have security.

197
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,900
- Hmm?
- Oh, hey, doc.

198
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,300
Absolutely terrifying.

199
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,000
Every painting in this gallery
belongs to either me or a client of i.Y.S.,

200
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,500
And i'll do whatever necessary
to protect it.

201
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,100
Dr. Lloyd, this is no longer a museum.

202
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,500
It's a vault with visiting hours.

203
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,300
Mr. Blackpoole...you know, i-I'd just
like to add that our security

204
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,200
Has years of experience....
in fact the fbi was just here.

205
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,500
Hello?

206
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,700
Hey, maggie, how you doing?

207
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,800
Dr. Sinclair. Adam. What a nice surprise.

208
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,500
Ease into it. Don't rush her.

209
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,400
Yeah. Listen, i'm in --I'm back
in los angeles for a while.

210
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,200
You know, i had to ask her out 10 times
efore we even got a coffee --

211
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,400
Coffee? I would love to.
Yeah. What time?

212
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
In an hour? I -- Yeah, i would love to.

213
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,100
Let me write down where you want to go.

214
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,300
I know exactly where that place is at.

215
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,800
All right. I'm looking forward to it.

216
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,800
Yeah --All right -- No.

217
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,700
She probably just really wants
some hot coffee.

218
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,300
- Shut up!
- It's not like a date.

219
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,100
Are you kidding me?
You're fixing your hair?

220
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,500
Because i'm playing
the professor sinclair dude!

221
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,100
Thank you.

222
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,500
You come here a lot?

223
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,700
No.
I just wanted to see you.

224
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,800
That's a date.

225
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,000
Did we really need to put
a button cam on eliot?

226
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Safety issue.

227
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,000
We're not gonna talk about art
all afternoon, are we?

228
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,600
- No.
- Good.

229
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,300
It's all my ex-Husband
ever wanted to talk about.

230
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,300
And that was so tedious.

231
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,700
Listen...i want to thank you.

232
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,400
I haven't dated a lot
since my marriage broke up.

233
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,500
I'm sorry to hear that.

234
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,100
No, don't be. He was obsessive,
perfectionist, controlling.

235
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,700
Organized! She used to say
i was organized. And punctual.

236
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
He must have had some good qualities.

237
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,700
No, not even in bed.

238
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,800
Every night was prom night.
You know what i mean?

239
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,300
But worst of all...

240
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,700
...he completely forgot that i gave him that
same button camera for christmas three years ago.

241
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,600
I can explain.

242
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,300
- Did it occur to you that...
- I feel used.

243
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,800
You lied to me, nate. I don't know why
i'm surprised.

244
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's going great.

245
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,500
We can tell.

246
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,800
- Maggie! Maggie!
- And to think
i felt sorry for you --

247
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,200
That whole sob story about being broke and
sleeping in your car and a drunk.

248
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,800
Was!Was broke.Was sleeping in the car.

249
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,000
The drunk thing,
not quite in the past tense.

250
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,200
What is all this, nate?

251
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,900
This -- Them...

252
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,900
Maggie, we help people.

253
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,800
You break the law.

254
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,700
No -- Pick up where the law leaves off.

255
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,500
Wow.

256
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,800
You are not the same man i married.

257
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,500
- Uh, what --
- So, who does this help?

258
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,700
Blackpoole's a bastard, nate. He was
a bastard when you worked for him.

259
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,400
What's changed?

260
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,600
Just help me understand.

261
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,900
I have to tell you something, mag.

262
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,700
Please.

263
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,500
What?

264
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,700
Mag...when sam was in stage iv,

265
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,000
I found a treatment
that would've helped him.

266
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,000
And i went to ian to pay for it...
and he wouldn't.

267
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,400
- He wouldn't?
- He wouldn't.

268
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,800
I told him we had mortgaged the house,
sold the car, that we were broke,

269
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,800
And he still wouldn't pay the claim.

270
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,600
20 years at that company, and they
wouldn't help save our son.

271
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,100
Why didn't you tell me this?

272
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,300
I work with these people, nate.
I am friendly with them.

273
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,500
You just let me walk around
like an idiot.????

274
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,800
????

275
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,100
Why have you just been carrying
this around all this time?

276
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,700
I didn't want you to hate me, maggie.

277
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,500
Why would i hate you?

278
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,200
I do.

279
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,700
If i had ever seen you look at me the way
i looked at myself in the mirror,

280
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,400
I would've blown my damn brains out.

281
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:50,000
No!! No!!

282
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

283
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,500
Come here.

284
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,600
When eliot spencer worked here as
a security guard under a fake name,

285
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
He gave a real cellphone number
as a reference.

286
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,500
Look who just got a call from that number.

287
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,500
Oh, maggie. What a shame.

288
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,900
???With any luck,
they'll never know what hit 'em.

289
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,800
And that --That's the plan.

290
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,600
You actually expect this to work?

291
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,200
No, no, you're supposed to say,"wow.
That's just crazy enough to work."

292
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,800
Incredibly, chance does seem to bend
itself to his bizarre machinations.

293
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,500
That's his superpower.

294
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,000
Okay, um...now, do you have
what we need?

295
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I have to check museum inventory.

296
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,700
Oh. Easy.

297
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,600
This is confidential.

298
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,700
You're not reading my e-Mails, are you?

299
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,100
No. No.

300
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,400
He won't --Here.

301
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,800
This is the only thing
big enough for what you need.

302
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,100
Great. Okay. Now, how soon can you get
that in the restoration room?

303
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,000
That's not my department.

304
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,600
You have to convince the museum director,
darien lloyd, to pull it from the display.

305
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,400
Okay.

306
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,600
- Nate?
- Hmm?

307
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,300
You just can't make somebody do
what you want them to do.

308
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,200
That's -- That's what we do. I mean...

309
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,800
You're adorable.

310
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,000
Maggie, it won't fall out.
Just pretend it's not there.

311
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,700
Yeah, just forget my
ex-Husband's voice in my head,

312
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,700
Telling me what he thinks i should do.
I'm in therapy to solve this problem.

313
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,800
Uh...i -- Sorry.

314
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,000
Um, okay, parker's on her approach,
so i want you --

315
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,400
So nobody else finds it annoying when you
nag them in the middle of these things?

316
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,400
Why don't i run this one, nate?

317
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,100
Yeah. I don't nag.

318
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,400
You know, i just have, you know,
a clear big-Picture viewpoint.

319
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,100
Actually, you know what? We did kind of
liked the way sophie ran the last one.

320
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,000
Yeah. Yeah.

321
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Up until the point where she got
us caught, but other than that...

322
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,900
Yeah, all right.
Fine, fine. You're in therapy?

323
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,600
How come you didn't --

324
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,800
None of that. No. No. Hey,
i will cut you off.

325
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,100
What did parker switch
his allergy medication with?

326
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,900
Pollen -- Ragweed mostly.

327
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,300
And dextroamphetamines.

328
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,800
Oh!

329
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
- Oh, i'm so sorry.
- Oh, i'm so sorry. Did i step on your glasses?

330
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,100
- No, no, no, it's okay.
- Okay, good.

331
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,900
Okay, why don't you run up to him?

332
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,700
Being just a little bit out of breath,
it changes the speech rhythms,

333
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,700
Makes it harder to detect a lie.

334
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,600
Lloyd!

335
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,900
See? Like that right there.
It's informative.

336
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,300
You learn and you con.

337
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,700
You forgot this in my office.

338
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,900
I -- When was that?

339
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,200
Five minutes ago. I showed the designs
for the two davids exhibit.

340
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,500
You signed off on the benches.

341
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,400
You okay?

342
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,200
Good. Now steer him towards me.
Don't tell him.

343
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,500
Just give him half an idea.
Let him complete it.

344
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,600
I'll bring you the rest of the plans
after your thing in the egyptian room.

345
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,400
I have a thing in the egyptian room?

346
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,600
Roll that back.

347
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,000
That's parker. Stay on dr. Collins.

348
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,800
- Dr. Lloyd's there, too.
- Stay on dr. Collins.

349
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,900
Ahlan biki,director lloyd. Dr. Rahman
of the cairo museum.

350
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,100
I was -- I was so worried
that i had the wrong day.

351
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,800
Oh, no, no. I - I don't have an appointment.

352
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,200
Oh, yes, i do.

353
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,600
Oh, dear, that, um --No,
that doesn't sound good at all.

354
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,300
I've had it for weeks.

355
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:34,000
Well, i've confirmed the markings, and i concur
--Definitely fourth dynasty.

356
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,300
The sarcophagus of pharaoh menkaure.

357
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,700
Everything's blurry.

358
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,300
I'm so relieved to finally meet someone

359
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:47,000
Who's got the good sense to ignore all
that silly, silly curse business.

360
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,300
Say what?

361
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,000
Well, i'll certify
the authenticity as you requested.

362
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,500
It was very nice to meet you.

363
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,500
Thank you. Um...

364
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,900
So, oh, goodbye, then. And, well,
i-I recommend you --

365
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:07,100
You see a doctor about that cough.
It does seem to be going to your chest.

366
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,100
It's just allergies.

367
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,800
Okay, he's just checked all the places

368
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,500
The sarcophagus was stored
before it hit the museum.

369
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,400
Okay. What's he found?

370
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,700
Oh. Well, looky here.

371
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,300
Dr. Ernst volk, university of berlin -- Dead.

372
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,500
Dr. Schliemann, london museum -- Dead.

373
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,400
Oh.

374
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,300
Oh, and also the three guys that
actually discovered the tomb.

375
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Eliot, what does that say?

376
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,800
- It says "dead."
- D- E-D -- Dead, baby.

377
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,300
- D- E-A-D.
- D- E-A-D.

378
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,600
I- I know how to --I was throwing
a little style on it,

379
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,300
Just a little bit, a little style. I know
how to spell "dead," damn it.

380
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,900
I can steal a bank,
i can spell "dead."

381
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,100
Wrap it up now, maggie.

382
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,300
You're doing great.

383
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,500
There you are.

384
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,000
- Can you just sign these?
- Sure.

385
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,900
Hey, uh, maggie...

386
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,600
...you don't believe
in curses, do you?

387
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,100
You know, mummy's curses, unexplained deaths
around sarcophaguses?

388
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,400
Don't be silly. Everyone knows
it's a fungus.

389
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,600
What?

390
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,300
Aspergillus flavus --Found
on egyptian artifacts.

391
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,700
Gets in the eyes and nose,
infection spreads,

392
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,300
And the next thing you know --Another death
from the curse.

393
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,700
So, uh, what are the symptoms?

394
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,200
Congestion, memory loss, blurry vision.

395
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,700
Yep, yep, yep, yep. Seal it up.
Seal it up.

396
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,900
It's a good idea. I just, um --Just --
Just give me a moment.

397
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,200
You need something?

398
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,100
I was just trying to make myself useful.

399
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,300
Yeah, well, last time you tried that,
we had to blow up the office.

400
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,200
That's not fair.

401
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,700
- I was just getting used to it.
- What?

402
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,400
Having an office?

403
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,400
Being part of a team.

404
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,300
Look, i didn't mean --You know, it wasn't
supposed to go down like that.

405
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,700
What's going on?

406
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,000
Sophie here was just trying to apologize.

407
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,300
No, i wasn't.

408
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,800
She tried that with me earlier.
She kind of sucks at it.

409
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,500
A little bit.

410
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,000
Oh, did she give you the speech
about how we're thieves

411
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,400
And about how this is what thieves do
and if we were in her shoes,

412
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,600
We'd have done the same thing?

413
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,000
No, i think she was
just getting to that part.

414
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,200
??

415
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,000
I wasn't apologizing. I...

416
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,600
That's the problem.

417
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,800
I just wanted to see if...we...

418
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,600
We were all okay with each other.

419
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,100
Okay. There it is.

420
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,600
- I forgive you.
- Apology accepted.

421
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,800
No, i wasn't --Unh-Unh. You -- I didn't...

422
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,800
Oh, no, no. Just -- Uh, left a little bit.

423
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:46,200
Line this end up with the vermeer. Careful.
Watch the floor.

424
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,700
Right in front of the rembrandt
so it's lit up by the skylight.

425
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,700
And now, for the first time in 400 years,

426
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,300
The two davids are reunited.

427
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,700
I would like to express
my gratitude to the museum staff

428
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,500
And, of course, our fund-Raisers
and all of you

429
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,200
For the opportunity
of presenting michelangelo...

430
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,500
Pictures have been distributed.

431
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,900
We're scanning every guest
that comes into the museum.

432
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,600
Eliot spencer.

433
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,000
Eliot spencer --Wanted in five countries,
including myanmar,

434
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,600
Which is offering a half-Million-Dollar
bounty on his head.

435
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:35,000
Bringing spencer to justice
and getting paid for it?

436
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,400
It's icing on the cake.

437
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,800
Parker.

438
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,900
Parker -- Wanted in nine countries,
including brazil and yemen.

439
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,300
Tough choice. I'll have to flip a coin.

440
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,200
How about sophie devereaux?

441
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,000
England, france, spain,
luxembourg -- Europe, basically.

442
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,200
France. Wonderful shopping...

443
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,800
...horrifying prisons.

444
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,800
Alec hardison.

445
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,400
Well, he better not show
his face in iceland.

446
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,500
Perfect. I'll drop him off
on my way to france.

447
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,100
Nathan ford.

448
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,900
Oh, i have something
special planned for him.

449
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,300
No, no, no. It's nathan ford.

450
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,100
Well, well, well. What the hell
are you doing here?

451
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,500
Well, i bought a ticket.
It's open to the public.

452
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,500
- I don't think --
- Of course. Enjoy yourself.

453
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,300
You heard him.

454
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,700
Conspiracy to commit robbery
is what -- Five years?

455
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,600
Catching him in the act -- 20.

456
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,100
Pull guys off the galleries.
Follow nate ford.

457
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,600
- Where are you going?
- To scratch an itch.

458
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,300
You know, i have a museum to run.

459
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,000
- Did anything happen here?
- No.

460
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,800
Dr. Collins was asking you something.
You were working on something.

461
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,000
No, she didn't. I...

462
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,900
- I moved a mummy.
- Why?

463
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,100
No reason.

464
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,400
- Come on! Come on!
- ???

465
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,200
Look at this!

466
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,100
Directly under the davids.

467
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,600
Out of the sight lines of the cameras.

468
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,900
They're gonna drill right up
and through the display base.

469
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,200
Who? Who?

470
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:59,700
Whoever's hiding
in that sarcophagus.???

471
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,800
That's...a mummy.

472
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,300
- I think you set something off.
- Yeah.

473
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,500
I can't see them!

474
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,800
Sterling, get this thing open!

475
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,100
You two, open this up.

476
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,700
We can't. Homeland security.

477
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,000
What? An unnamed gas has been released
in a public space.

478
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,300
We have to evacuate the building.

479
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,100
Evacuate???

480
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,600
- It's federal protocol.
- We're not gonna evacuate.

481
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,100
It's federal protocol
for a chemical attack!

482
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,500
Did you say chemical attack?

483
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,300
There is no chemical attack. It's a robbery.

484
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,500
It's a robbery! Robbery!

485
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,500
Fine! Bloody hell!

486
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,600
All right. All security personnel,
evacuate the building immediately.

487
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,100
Evacuate the building immediately!

488
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,800
You can't leave. We don't even know
if they're in there.

489
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,300
We have no choice.

490
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,400
What the hell is going on here?

491
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,100
They've already stolen them.

492
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,400
They're using the crowd to smuggle them out
with the fakes!

493
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,900
Nobody move until i've
confiscated all the statues!

494
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,400
Excuse me, sir.
I thought we were evacuating.

495
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,100
We are. Keep them moving.
We've got to get out.

496
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,900
All right, geary, corral them outside.

497
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:14,900
Everybody, hand your statues
to the men in the black suits.

498
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,600
Fine. Do whatever you need to do now.

499
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,100
At least we got everyone
out of the building.

500
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,600
He got everyone out of the building.

501
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,300
They triggered the door locks.

502
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,400
Geary. Geary, where's ford?

503
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,300
We have an alarm on the roof!
Up on the roof.

504
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,700
Let's go to work.

505
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,800
- You got him?
- I got all of them.

506
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,200
Just a panic. The fire department's here.
This is your idea of control?

507
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,500
This is your last chance,
maggie. Come clean.

508
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,300
I don't know what you're talking about.

509
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,600
Two davids.

510
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Thank god.

511
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,900
Got you, nate.

512
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,500
Yes. That was the whole point.

513
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,500
Power's back up in about 15 seconds.

514
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,500
What do you mean?

515
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,400
You know -- All that chasing me around.

516
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:18,700
"Don't let nate ford near the two davids.
""How is nate ford gonna get the two davids?"

517
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,500
I wasn't the mastermind
on this one, sterling.

518
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,900
I'm the bait.

519
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:30,500
Three, two, one.

520
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,700
No!

521
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,400
T- The room was locked!

522
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,200
Sometimes the classics
really are the best.

523
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,400
They were masterpieces! They're worth --

524
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,600
$150 million.

525
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,600
The vermeer, caravaggio,
two van eycks -- At least.

526
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,900
We need to call the police.

527
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,000
Yes, he's right. We really should call
the police.

528
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
No, not the police.

529
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,700
- What do you mean?
- No, i'm responsible!

530
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,200
All the paintings in this room --
They were my responsibility.

531
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,800
No, they were all loaned to me...

532
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,500
Oh, well done.

533
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,800
Every single masterpiece
in this room is insured by i.Y.S.

534
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,900
That's a $150 million payout.

535
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,800
Now, what do you think your
board of directors are gonna do

536
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,500
When they realize that you've
lost the company $150 million?

537
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,400
- Clear the room.
- Where are they?

538
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,300
Clear the room!

539
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,600
Come on.

540
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,900
Are you here to kill me, ian?

541
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,600
Here's how it's gonna go, sterling.

542
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,700
I'm all ears.

543
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,300
No, you talk to me,
not to him. You talk to me.

544
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,200
Every single painting
will be returned to i.Y.S.

545
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,900
The moment ian blackpoole
is stripped of his position

546
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,600
And all his assets
in the company.

547
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,800
Also, his policy
of denying every claim --That ends.

548
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,500
Extortion.

549
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,300
I prefer to call it "oversight."

550
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,600
Last time i saw you, you were selling me
something. I got out of sales.

551
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,300
So, what are you in now?

552
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,700
Theft.

553
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:27,600
Yeah, i'm going to rob the two davids gallery
on opening day.

554
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,700
Well, aren't you gonna call
the police?

555
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,600
Of course not.

556
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,900
When the owners of these paintings

557
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,900
Realize that ian knew
there was gonna be a theft,

558
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,200
But didn't call the police,

559
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,700
Well, they're gonna sue the hell
out of him, aren't they?

560
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,300
But if the company, in good faith...

561
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,200
Returns their paintings?

562
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,200
They might not fire you
if you give them blackpoole.

563
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,600
No.

564
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,900
Sterling, you work for me.

565
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,800
I.Y.S. Is my company.

566
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,100
Can't let personal feelings
affect policy.

567
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,600
You have a responsibility
to shareholders.

568
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,500
No exceptions.

569
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,900
I have lost my only son.

570
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,900
Do you really think you scare me? Huh?

571
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,700
Maggie!

572
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,700
Will -- You understand --

573
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,000
Screw therapy. That felt really good.

574
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,600
Of course, you know your entire plan
depended on me

575
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,600
Being a self-Serving, utter bastard.

576
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,200
Hmm. Yeah, that's a stretch.

577
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,800
I'll call you when it's done.

578
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,700
You do that.

579
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,400
Where are you going?

580
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,700
Where's he going?!

581
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,800
- Will you stop now?
- I don't know.

582
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,700
- Interesting.
- Hmm?

583
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,300
You admitting you don't know something.

584
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,200
It's done. Blackpoole's out.

585
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,600
- Time to return the artwork?
- I think so.

586
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,300
Eliot and hardison

587
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,400
Will replace the floor panel,
seal the hole --

588
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,500
No one will ever know what happened.

589
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,100
We'll move the artwork
into the loading dock,

590
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,700
Make it look like someone from the outside
dropped it off.

591
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,900
You are not the man i married.

592
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,900
Well, what do you think
of this version?

593
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:45,000
I don't love him, but i might like him
a little more.

594
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,400
Thank you...all of you.

595
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,700
You surprised me.

596
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,700
We had a good run.

597
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,800
It's a good time to move on.

598
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,100
I'm going somewhere...else.

599
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,200
A fresh start.

600
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:29,000
We made a difference. Remember that.

601
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,000
Where you going?

602
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,100
Let's see how hard
you look.
