00:00:01,511 --> 00:00:02,857
<i>A-shift ascending mine.</i>

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,671
<i>B-shift descending in five minutes.</i>

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,466
- Nice work today, guys. Appreciate it.
- Thanks. You too.

4
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:10,926
Nice work. Appreciate it.
Good job. See you tomorrow.

5
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,942
- How you doing?
- How'd it go there today?

6
00:00:13,067 --> 00:00:16,509
Good. Except I found 3/10% of methane
in the number four heading.

7
00:00:16,634 --> 00:00:18,893
So we went ahead
and held the curtain closer to the face.

8
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:21,145
I'll take another reading
when I get down there.

9
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:23,783
- You coming to Cory's birthday party?
- Of course.

10
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:25,483
- What is he, like 13?
- 14.

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,985
- Can't believe it.
- We're getting old.

12
00:00:28,925 --> 00:00:30,905
You want Lisa
to make her potato salad?

13
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:34,733
- Only reason you were invited, boy.
- I'm not paying you boys to lollygag!

14
00:00:37,783 --> 00:00:40,096
- Talk to you later.
- All right. See you later.

15
00:01:12,686 --> 00:01:13,736
Oh, my god!

16
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,159
- Somebody call for help!
- Call my lawyer.

17
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:23,290
Season 3 Episode 10
<i>The Underground Job</i>

18
00:01:24,706 --> 00:01:25,941
Go on, Mr. Rollins.

19
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:31,090
I lost 12 brothers that day.

20
00:01:32,535 --> 00:01:35,761
- What caused the explosion?
- It was a buildup of methane gas.

21
00:01:36,386 --> 00:01:38,723
See, the mine had
substandard ventilation.

22
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:41,809
We all knew about it,
But there ain't nothing we could do.

23
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:45,157
So I guess getting another line
of work wouldn't be an option.

24
00:01:45,282 --> 00:01:47,615
Mines are the only way to make
a decent living around there.

25
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,797
I'm not looking
for your charity, Mr. Ford.

26
00:01:50,922 --> 00:01:54,447
We like the work. We'd just like
to be able to do it safely is all.

27
00:01:55,097 --> 00:01:56,247
I understand.

28
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,730
So the CEO of the mine,
this Dan Blackwell,

29
00:01:59,855 --> 00:02:02,329
he received government money
after the explosion.

30
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,791
Figures... You kill your own men,
and Uncle Sam writes you a check.

31
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,202
That money was supposed to
go to mine-safety improvements.

32
00:02:09,327 --> 00:02:12,131
I don't know where that money went,
but it didn't make it into the mine.

33
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,551
That place is just as bad now
as it was two years ago.

34
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,762
- Maybe worse.
- All right.

35
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:22,183
We're gonna find that money, and we're
gonna put it back where it belongs.

36
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:24,385
Thank you.

37
00:02:25,615 --> 00:02:26,645
Thank you.

38
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,460
The rich and powerful
take what they want.

39
00:02:29,585 --> 00:02:30,900
We steal it back for you.

40
00:02:38,612 --> 00:02:42,411
Sometimes, bad guys
make the best good guys.

41
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,010
We provide leverage!

42
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:50,211
It turns out Blackwell did use
the money for safety measures...

43
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,313
Or one big safety measure.

44
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:56,100
- She's named Debra Pierce.
- West Virginia Attorney General.

45
00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:58,010
Her hair's so poofy.

46
00:02:59,494 --> 00:03:02,253
Thanks to a recent supreme court
decision removing limits

47
00:03:02,378 --> 00:03:04,146
on corporate campaign contributions,

48
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:06,811
Blackwell was able to sink
all of his safety money

49
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,745
into Pierce's political
action committee.

50
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,233
So instead of making the mines safer,
he hired himself an Attorney General.

51
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:15,736
He's getting his money's worth.
Since the explosion two years ago,

52
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,822
Blackwell has received
nearly 400 citations

53
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,699
for unsafe working conditions.

54
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:23,350
Even he can't just make
400 citations disappear.

55
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:25,454
- Can he?
- No, but he can bury 'em.

56
00:03:25,887 --> 00:03:27,474
What he does is he appeals them,

57
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,556
and Pierce makes sure
that those appeals go on forever.

58
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:33,838
So while the citations are under appeal,
he doesn't have to pay a cent.

59
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:37,341
We can't go after Blackwell
with an AG in his back pocket.

60
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,635
No, but we can take down
both of them.

61
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,888
What we do is we get Blackwell
to give us the money from the pac,

62
00:03:43,276 --> 00:03:45,219
And then once
that money is transferred,

63
00:03:45,344 --> 00:03:48,259
we flag both of them
for misuse of campaign funds.

64
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:51,830
- The skagway shuffle.
- That's what I was thinking.

65
00:03:51,955 --> 00:03:53,732
See, now y'all are just
making stuff up.

66
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,265
- It's like the fiddle game.
- Yeah, only underground.

67
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,321
- Is Eliot gonna be the fiddle again?
- No.

68
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,229
- Can I be the fiddle?
- No.

69
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,713
The mine is the fiddle.
We convince him

70
00:04:03,838 --> 00:04:07,413
he's got something valuable in his mine,
then we sell him a process to mine it,

71
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,099
and then we take all his money.

72
00:04:09,224 --> 00:04:10,830
Right. Good.

73
00:04:11,906 --> 00:04:15,504
- So, how are we gonna do that?
- We're gonna sell the guy his own mine.

74
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,359
All right. There he is.

75
00:04:22,484 --> 00:04:25,434
- This here is section "B".
- Section "B". All right.

76
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:28,858
Basically, I need you to point me out a
direction where I can be out of the way.

77
00:04:28,983 --> 00:04:31,448
- No problem. That'd be section "C".
- Section "C".

78
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:33,127
Hey, Cory!
Come here!

79
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,966
He's a good kid.
He'll show you around.

80
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:38,079
Listen.
Be careful back there.

81
00:04:38,204 --> 00:04:39,878
That section's been
abandoned for years,

82
00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:41,947
and them old wooden
mine supports is unstable.

83
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,866
- Yeah, boss.
- This here is Eric.

84
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:46,785
I need you to show him to section "C"
so he can do some dust readings.

85
00:04:49,447 --> 00:04:50,247
This way.

86
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:55,628
Morning.

87
00:04:56,002 --> 00:04:58,584
- Can I help you?
- I'm Cara Hetzel. This is Jesse Oaks.

88
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:01,589
We're here from the mine safety
coalition to do a spot inspection.

89
00:05:01,714 --> 00:05:04,887
Fine. Let me get my mine supervisor,
show you around...

90
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,263
Clark!

91
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:08,115
Can you...

92
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:11,407
be so kind as to show
the inspectors around?

93
00:05:11,532 --> 00:05:14,178
Be careful what kind of rocks
you turn over down there.

94
00:05:14,303 --> 00:05:15,981
Mining can be a dangerous business.

95
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,482
It sure can.

96
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,076
Who are you?

97
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,920
Mr. Blackwell. Bob Gibson.

98
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:31,229
I'm here to make you an offer
you can't refuse.

99
00:05:31,354 --> 00:05:33,123
- Really?
- I want to buy your mine.

100
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,125
Excuse me?

101
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,253
I didn't realize you were hard of hearing
I heard that can happen to miners.

102
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,965
I want to buy your mine.

103
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,591
Mine's not for sale.

104
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,176
I was afraid you'd say that.

105
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,888
I'm gonna write down a little number,
and we'll stop playing these games.

106
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,183
The mine is not for sale.
Or are you hard of hearing?

107
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,935
You don't have to be rude.

108
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:55,771
I just want to give you an opportunity
to make a lot of money.

109
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,482
Now, look, I know you country folk,
you like the simple life.

110
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:02,796
But the simple life looks a lot better
on the back of a 100-foot yacht, say.

111
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,364
I appreciate your generosity,
Mr. Gilman.

112
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,657
Bob Gibson.

113
00:06:08,987 --> 00:06:10,536
I'm doing fine on my own.

114
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:14,468
If you say so.

115
00:06:14,611 --> 00:06:16,166
Listen, if you change your mind,

116
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:18,085
give me a call.

117
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,133
Okay, Parker.
Are you in place?

118
00:06:26,521 --> 00:06:27,761
Almost.

119
00:06:28,197 --> 00:06:31,807
- You sure someone else can't do this?
- We need all hands on deck on this one.

120
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:33,809
<i>Just do what Sophie told you.</i>

121
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,097
A great grift is like a romance.

122
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:40,206
You have to find out what they want

123
00:06:40,331 --> 00:06:41,793
and just give it to them.

124
00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:43,890
You have to woo them.

125
00:06:44,015 --> 00:06:45,237
I don't woo.

126
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:48,549
Tell me how you break into a bank.

127
00:06:49,268 --> 00:06:50,968
Clock the cameras, count the guards,

128
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:53,221
find the silent alarms,
look for a weak spot to enter,

129
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,581
pick the vault's combination,
and steal the money.

130
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,565
Just analyze Pierce the same way
you would a security system.

131
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:01,787
Here.
Take notes.

132
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,299
There's your mark.

133
00:07:06,188 --> 00:07:07,342
Find her weak spots.

134
00:07:07,771 --> 00:07:10,345
With politicians,
it's usually a need for adoration.

135
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,807
The same way that you wear black
to mask yourself from security cameras,

136
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,675
Flattery can mask your intentions.

137
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,665
Find the right combination,
and you can unlock the mark's trust.

138
00:07:21,512 --> 00:07:24,172
- And then you can steal her...
- Soul.

139
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,946
I was gonna say "confidence".

140
00:07:30,923 --> 00:07:33,818
You can do this, Parker.
Just trust your instincts.

141
00:07:38,135 --> 00:07:39,249
Parker, go!

142
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,298
Under my continued direction,

143
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,102
the people of West Virginia

144
00:07:48,227 --> 00:07:50,807
will be known as the people
who love freedom,

145
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,555
who love justice,

146
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,067
and who fight for what they love!

147
00:07:56,906 --> 00:07:59,148
And who fight for what they love.

148
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:02,106
Will you let me continue
to fight for you?

149
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:03,982
Yes, yes, and yes!

150
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:06,902
Beautiful speech, Ms. Pierce.

151
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:08,946
- Who are you?
- I'm your biggest fan.

152
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,073
And hopefully,
your new campaign consultant...

153
00:08:11,923 --> 00:08:14,576
I've been following your career since
your first term in the state senate.

154
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:17,851
And this is your chamber
where you dispense justice

155
00:08:17,976 --> 00:08:19,740
and fight for freedom!

156
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:25,295
- Still didn't catch your name, sweetie.
- Kelly Beth? Kelly Beth Laughlin?

157
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,214
But you can call me Kelly Beth.

158
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,716
Can I call you "boss"?

159
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:33,045
Darlin', as much as I'd love your energy
in the homestretch of this campaign,

160
00:08:33,373 --> 00:08:35,556
I don't have much of a budget
for a campaign consultant.

161
00:08:35,997 --> 00:08:37,349
I'm Kelly Beth Laughlin...

162
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,103
of the Maysville Laughlins.

163
00:08:41,426 --> 00:08:42,896
See, I don't need a salary.

164
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:45,816
In fact, I would pay
for the experience of working for you.

165
00:08:46,998 --> 00:08:49,403
Damn, I'm happy to work
with anybody willing to pay for it.

166
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,114
Welcome aboard Team Pierce.

167
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:53,490
I'm in.

168
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,718
Section "C."

169
00:09:01,524 --> 00:09:03,500
So, what did you do
to get stuck with busy work?

170
00:09:04,707 --> 00:09:05,707
Me?

171
00:09:06,644 --> 00:09:08,739
I'm the new guy.
What's your story?

172
00:09:09,902 --> 00:09:12,301
- I'm the young guy.
- Yeah? How old are you?

173
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,200
- 18.
- 18? Why aren't you in school?

174
00:09:17,132 --> 00:09:18,557
School doesn't pay the mortgage.

175
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:21,459
You're a little young to have
a wife and kid, aren't you?

176
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:25,152
It's my mom and my sister.

177
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:28,525
My dad was in the explosion
two years ago.

178
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:32,266
I'm sorry.

179
00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:56,520
Now, there's no cell reception
underground.

180
00:09:56,645 --> 00:09:59,895
The miners use a leaky feeder signal
to communicate in the mine.

181
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,086
But that's not compatible
with our comms.

182
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,229
I know.
Quite the problem.

183
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,132
You're wondering
if I have an answer?

184
00:10:08,202 --> 00:10:09,202
I do.

185
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:11,481
I created these UHF wireless nodes

186
00:10:11,606 --> 00:10:13,570
to couple with the leaky feeder,
boost the signal,

187
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,650
- And then we...
- I know! I put them in the mine!

188
00:10:16,775 --> 00:10:19,368
- Yeah, but they're very...
- What? I got it! They're fragile!

189
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:23,114
I thought we was making progress.

190
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,260
<i>Section C's prepped.</i>

191
00:10:32,493 --> 00:10:34,381
And now to section "C"?

192
00:10:36,775 --> 00:10:37,941
Right this way.

193
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,335
- What is that?
- Dust reading.

194
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,160
That doesn't look like
no dust-reading kit.

195
00:10:57,695 --> 00:11:00,242
You don't look like
no certified MSC safety inspector.

196
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,038
Look.

197
00:11:05,595 --> 00:11:06,698
You're sure?

198
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:11,900
Yes, I understand the DA
would like this taken care of,

199
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:14,602
but you remind him
that my time is valuable

200
00:11:14,727 --> 00:11:17,017
and he hasn't bought
any of it recently.

201
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:18,427
Thank you.

202
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,221
- Getting comfy?
- Yes, ma'am.

203
00:11:23,346 --> 00:11:25,738
I've set up re-election facebook
and twitter accounts,

204
00:11:25,863 --> 00:11:29,160
opened a political action committee
called tomorrow's women

205
00:11:29,285 --> 00:11:30,939
to consolidate the online donations.

206
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,107
I like it.

207
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:35,653
And so far,
we've raised 436 dollars.

208
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,614
Color me pink
and put me in a pigpen.

209
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,035
You're a fast worker.

210
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:09,602
You know what they say
about idle hands.

211
00:12:17,212 --> 00:12:19,988
- How many fines am I not paying today?
- None.

212
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,491
They took some weird tests,
said they were dust readings.

213
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,368
- What do you think they were?
- No idea.

214
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,953
But they looked pretty pleased
with whatever they found.

215
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:30,283
What are the odds
of the shady inspectors and the...

216
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,710
man trying to buy my mine showing up
here on the same day, you think?

217
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:35,712
I'd say not good.

218
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,363
They mention
where they might be going?

219
00:12:38,488 --> 00:12:41,234
They did ask for a commendation
on a place to eat.

220
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,383
I sent 'em on down to carver's.

221
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:54,304
Did they buy
the safety-inspection bit?

222
00:12:54,429 --> 00:12:55,613
Absolutely.

223
00:13:04,687 --> 00:13:06,284
Right on schedule. You're up.

224
00:13:06,706 --> 00:13:10,163
- Great work today! You're a peach!
- I'll talk to you later, Mr. Gibson.

225
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:22,843
- Hello, there, again, Mr. Blackwell.
- Just cut the act.

226
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,679
Who are you,
and what are you doing with Mr. Gibson?

227
00:13:27,061 --> 00:13:28,102
You know,

228
00:13:28,227 --> 00:13:32,060
impersonating a federal safety inspector
is a felony in West Virginia.

229
00:13:33,115 --> 00:13:35,105
My name is Eloise Tinson.

230
00:13:35,406 --> 00:13:37,392
I'm a mineral extraction expert.

231
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:39,895
I'm in town to make Mr. Gibson
a very wealthy man,

232
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,846
take home a little
something for myself.

233
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:45,974
Your expertise is wasted on Mr. Gibson.
He doesn't own the mine.

234
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:48,045
On the contrary, Mr. Blackwell,

235
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,804
he owns the 400 acres
to the north and east of yours.

236
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:53,177
And I hear he made
a little offer on yours today.

237
00:13:53,694 --> 00:13:55,336
Mine's not on the market. And...

238
00:13:56,683 --> 00:13:59,588
his land is mined out years ago.

239
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,673
Yes.
For coal.

240
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,830
We're looking
for something a little more...

241
00:14:05,123 --> 00:14:06,300
lucrative.

242
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:15,812
- Coltan?
- Columbite-tantalite.

243
00:14:16,183 --> 00:14:19,274
It's a mineral found in cellphones,
DVD players, computers.

244
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,526
It's found in abundance
in central Africa.

245
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,219
Frankly, everything's a bloody
mess over there.

246
00:14:24,605 --> 00:14:27,866
American companies are desperate
to get their hands on a domestic source.

247
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,039
What is your role in all this?

248
00:14:30,164 --> 00:14:34,112
My company developed a process
for locating and mining Coltan.

249
00:14:34,237 --> 00:14:36,666
Mr. Gibson is buying that process.

250
00:14:37,706 --> 00:14:40,098
If there's Coltan in my mine...

251
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,173
Mr. Gibson isn't gonna get
his hands on it.

252
00:14:43,475 --> 00:14:46,577
According to the readings
that my partner and I took today,

253
00:14:46,702 --> 00:14:48,462
yes, there is Coltan in your mine.

254
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:51,698
And using our process,
Mr. Gibson is gonna be able to mine it

255
00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:54,059
- right out from under you.
- The hell he will.

256
00:14:54,982 --> 00:14:56,979
You're not the only one
with a partner.

257
00:15:06,934 --> 00:15:09,338
Blackwell just left Sophie.
Did you plant the form?

258
00:15:09,463 --> 00:15:11,653
It's on her desk
with the other forms you gave me.

259
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,370
Good.
Make sure she finds it.

260
00:15:24,622 --> 00:15:27,425
How do you do it?
How do you handle all this?

261
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:31,846
The thing about justice is,
it's messy.

262
00:15:32,716 --> 00:15:35,678
It's kind of like a sewer,
and I'm the one who controls the pipe.

263
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,895
When things are running smoothly,
no one pays any attention.

264
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,981
But you know what happens
when you lose control.

265
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,590
- It stinks!
- Exactly.

266
00:15:42,715 --> 00:15:45,151
And I'm the one who ends up
with you-know-what on her face.

267
00:15:46,051 --> 00:15:47,356
I make it my first priority.

268
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:49,698
Make sure all the dung's
running in the right direction.

269
00:15:53,936 --> 00:15:54,661
Hello.

270
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,743
Hi. It's Dan.

271
00:15:56,868 --> 00:15:59,291
Do you have
a mineral rights application

272
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:00,943
<i>for the land next to mine?</i>

273
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,421
- Cream...
- Six sugars.

274
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:10,035
Bob Gibson.

275
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,553
Tract 516.

276
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,806
Applying for all mineral rights
both known and unknown.

277
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,309
<i>What could be unknown?</i>

278
00:16:16,626 --> 00:16:17,626
Coltan.

279
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:21,229
Listen, do you think
you could lose that application?

280
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,762
I could put it
on the bottom of the pile, but...

281
00:16:23,887 --> 00:16:26,067
I'm sure he filed a copy
with the development department.

282
00:16:26,192 --> 00:16:27,558
<i>It's gonna turn up eventually.</i>

283
00:16:27,683 --> 00:16:29,613
That's good enough.
I just need you to stall him.

284
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,197
You gonna tell me what Coltan is?

285
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:47,773
<i>Hello?</i>

286
00:16:47,898 --> 00:16:51,064
Ms. Tinson? Listen, I'm afraid
I have some bad news for you.

287
00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:53,861
<i>Mr. Gibson is not gonna be
buying your process.</i>

288
00:16:53,986 --> 00:16:55,263
And why is that?

289
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:57,182
Because I'm gonna buy it first.

290
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,769
<i>But I'm gonna need a demonstration,
if you could...</i>

291
00:17:01,032 --> 00:17:02,771
stop by the mine
first thing tomorrow?

292
00:17:03,786 --> 00:17:04,972
Until then.

293
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,399
Till then.

294
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,695
He's hooked.

295
00:17:12,568 --> 00:17:14,363
Our sonar-detection technology

296
00:17:14,488 --> 00:17:16,883
tells us exactly
where the Coltan is located.

297
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:21,165
Look at that.

298
00:17:22,103 --> 00:17:24,923
There's a very strong presence
of Coltan in here.

299
00:17:25,048 --> 00:17:27,420
Really?
This is quite a fancy machine.

300
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:31,867
I hope you don't mind
if I double-check the old-fashioned way?

301
00:17:32,366 --> 00:17:35,011
Coltan's generally found
in isolated pockets,

302
00:17:35,136 --> 00:17:38,347
so those surface tests,
they can be very inconclusive.

303
00:17:38,472 --> 00:17:39,516
I'm sure.

304
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:41,810
We'll see here.

305
00:17:47,753 --> 00:17:50,568
- Look at that.
- That looks conclusive to me.

306
00:17:51,685 --> 00:17:52,911
Rock-dusting duty.

307
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,929
It seems like Troy's doing everything
he can to keep us from real work.

308
00:17:58,211 --> 00:17:59,285
This is real work.

309
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:01,722
Somebody's got to keep
the coal out of our lungs.

310
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:04,833
This looks different than usual.

311
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:06,845
It does.

312
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:09,460
Look here, bro.
Limestone dust laced with Coltan

313
00:18:09,585 --> 00:18:12,138
is gonna look different
than plain old limestone dust.

314
00:18:12,263 --> 00:18:14,682
I appreciate your faith in me,
but I do not have the power

315
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:17,149
<i>to change the chemical
composition of minerals.</i>

316
00:18:17,274 --> 00:18:19,421
Lab geeks must have come up
with something new.

317
00:18:19,948 --> 00:18:21,276
A formula or...

318
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:25,350
This area right here is lighting up
like a Christmas tree.

319
00:18:25,475 --> 00:18:28,035
You'll be able to get a good
six months out of that vein.

320
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:32,143
This area, not so much. But...

321
00:18:32,756 --> 00:18:34,838
this right down here...
Now, this...

322
00:18:35,112 --> 00:18:37,493
You'll be able to put
that new addition on your house and...

323
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:40,022
get that fishing boat
you've been wanting.

324
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:43,427
That's the beauty of the process:
No more digging blind.

325
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,564
It sounds good to me.

326
00:18:46,863 --> 00:18:49,404
You know, maybe I'll be able
to lay off some of these,

327
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:52,751
Hillbillies I pay to dig in the dirt
all day long here.

328
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:55,125
Mining used to be worthwhile,
you know.

329
00:18:56,149 --> 00:18:58,874
But now with the unions
and the workers whining all the time,

330
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:01,598
about not getting paid enough
and they're never safe enough and all.

331
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:05,268
I mean, it's hard to keep a business
and make a buck.

332
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,627
I'm pretty confident
using this process,

333
00:19:09,752 --> 00:19:12,192
you'll be able to make
quite a few bucks.

334
00:19:12,725 --> 00:19:13,943
I'm convinced.

335
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,111
Excellent.

336
00:19:15,735 --> 00:19:16,946
Let's talk numbers.

337
00:19:18,195 --> 00:19:21,517
All right.
Well, he's got 125,000 dollars liquid.

338
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:24,746
And $500,000 in the pac.

339
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,043
$600,000.
We're gonna need it in one payment.

340
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,627
We've found that installments
can get a little bit messy.

341
00:19:30,946 --> 00:19:31,807
Of course.

342
00:19:31,932 --> 00:19:34,712
By tomorrow. Mr. Gibson was gonna
write us a check in the morning.

343
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:36,925
Now, if that's gonna
be a problem for you...

344
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,515
No problem.
I'm having a fundraiser

345
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,310
for the Attorney General
at the Morgan Club tomorrow.

346
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:44,432
You stop by there,
I'll cut you a check.

347
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:45,934
Perfect.

348
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:49,312
Sophie's done with Blackwell.
He's hooked.

349
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,079
<i>You can surface.</i>

350
00:19:51,912 --> 00:19:53,984
I don't want to leave
these guys one man down.

351
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,109
<i>Okay. Fine.</i>

352
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,220
<i>You can finish the day.
But tomorrow, we're gone.</i>

353
00:19:57,345 --> 00:19:59,071
Paul Revere make that lunchbox?

354
00:20:01,114 --> 00:20:02,114
Nope.

355
00:20:02,689 --> 00:20:04,129
This was made in 1958.

356
00:20:04,254 --> 00:20:06,333
Paul Revere died in the early 1800s.

357
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,749
What? You don't think I know
who Paul Revere is?

358
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,496
All right, smartass.

359
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,504
This was my dad's.

360
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,548
Grandpa's before that.

361
00:20:19,656 --> 00:20:22,109
Scoop seems to be running
a little slow this morning.

362
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:24,420
- Transmission's slipping again.
- All right.

363
00:20:24,545 --> 00:20:25,748
I'll look into it.

364
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:31,855
You want to be the man of the house...
That's the way right there.

365
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,567
Future's in the machines.
It's faster, it's safer.

366
00:20:35,997 --> 00:20:38,361
You want to provide for your family,
learn how to use the scoop.

367
00:20:39,745 --> 00:20:40,947
I'm just saying.

368
00:20:41,232 --> 00:20:42,808
You got a good head for it...

369
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,701
Paul Revere.

370
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,283
Your latest numbers are up.

371
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:52,707
Significantly up.

372
00:20:54,012 --> 00:20:56,201
I don't think
I ever seen it jump this high.

373
00:20:56,326 --> 00:20:57,088
Really?

374
00:20:57,498 --> 00:20:59,132
Nate said to make them higher.

375
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,405
How am I supposed to know
what's "significantly higher"

376
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,194
and what's "insignificantly higher"?

377
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:07,208
No, that's fine. We just need her
to feel she has a comfortable lead

378
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,809
so she'll be fine with Blackwell
using the pac funds.

379
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:13,026
We must be doing something right.

380
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:15,346
Yeah, must be
your latest commercial...

381
00:21:15,772 --> 00:21:17,972
Or your hair...
People love your hair.

382
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:19,402
Really?

383
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,115
Hello, Dan.

384
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,780
Refill?

385
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:31,456
I like this one.

386
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,644
Blackwell's here.
It's happening.

387
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,963
No way!
I have an election coming up.

388
00:21:44,088 --> 00:21:45,863
The Coltan mine's
not gonna do you any good

389
00:21:45,988 --> 00:21:47,973
without me keeping it
from getting shut down!

390
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,741
If I don't have that money
by tomorrow,

391
00:21:49,866 --> 00:21:51,601
they're gonna sell
this process to Gibson.

392
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,895
So?
Use the mine's money.

393
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:57,096
<i>The mine doesn't have
that sort of liquidity.</i>

394
00:21:57,221 --> 00:21:59,413
<i>You're paying your workers
with something, aren't you?</i>

395
00:21:59,538 --> 00:22:01,540
Yeah. I suppose I could take the...

396
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:05,198
money out the payroll.
But that would bankrupt the mine.

397
00:22:05,498 --> 00:22:07,700
You say that like it's a bad thing.

398
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,708
All right.

399
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:17,126
Here we go.

400
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:22,394
Clark? Tell the men not to come
to work tomorrow.

401
00:22:24,008 --> 00:22:24,926
All of 'em.

402
00:22:25,393 --> 00:22:27,694
And make sure
there's nobody in that mine.

403
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:29,812
And then call me back.

404
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,308
I got a job of work for you to do.

405
00:22:33,816 --> 00:22:35,483
That's a great day's work.

406
00:22:36,248 --> 00:22:39,732
Blackwell's shutting down the mine
and using the payroll money to pay us.

407
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,892
So we've just bankrupted
an entire town.

408
00:22:42,017 --> 00:22:44,711
Worse.
He's not justhutting down the mine.

409
00:22:45,381 --> 00:22:46,698
He's blowing it up.

410
00:22:47,196 --> 00:22:48,425
That does sound worse.

411
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,160
You know, working in insurance,
I've seen this play a thousand times.

412
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,287
And now that we've convinced him
he has Coltan,

413
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,732
his mine is worth
more dead than alive.

414
00:22:55,857 --> 00:22:58,793
He's not gonna have time to get a bomb
and plant it in the mine by tomorrow.

415
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,033
His mine is practically
a bomb already.

416
00:23:01,158 --> 00:23:03,548
You could throw a lit cigarette there,
and that thing would blow.

417
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,842
- Won't take much.
- What are we gonna do, Nate?

418
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:09,345
We're gonna convince him
that you're a lying, greedy bitch.

419
00:23:13,878 --> 00:23:15,818
I'm gonna call Blackwell
and draw him here.

420
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,940
He's not gonna blow up the mine
while he's in it, is he?

421
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,941
That will give us enough time
to find the bomb.

422
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,066
Plenty of time.

423
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,970
Meanwhile, I'll be here, in the van,
as far away from the mine as possible.

424
00:23:25,095 --> 00:23:26,446
My dude.
Go with god.

425
00:23:27,557 --> 00:23:29,949
- What are you doing, man?
- For morale, man!

426
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,118
Let's get this show on the road.

427
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:34,539
Mr. Blackwell.

428
00:23:35,074 --> 00:23:36,748
Yeah, it's Bob Gibson here.

429
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,161
Mr. Gibson.
You calling to concede?

430
00:23:39,286 --> 00:23:41,675
No, I'm calling to tell you
that we've both been had.

431
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,338
Yeah, there's no Coltan in your mine
or anywhere near it.

432
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,582
I should have pegged you
for a sore loser.

433
00:23:46,707 --> 00:23:47,842
<i>I can prove it to you.</i>

434
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,677
Just meet me at the mine
in 15 minutes.

435
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:53,464
No, the mine's not a good idea.
Now, maybe we can meet somewhere else...

436
00:24:01,782 --> 00:24:03,498
<i>This is Clark.
Leave a message.</i>

437
00:24:04,437 --> 00:24:07,363
Listen. Where the hell are you?
Now, don't plant the device.

438
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,029
I'm on my way to the mine now.

439
00:24:09,154 --> 00:24:11,422
Do not plant the device.

440
00:24:12,395 --> 00:24:14,245
He's on his way to you now.

441
00:24:14,523 --> 00:24:18,521
While they deal with Blackwell,
we've got to spook Pierce.

442
00:24:18,646 --> 00:24:21,364
On it.
So we need ghosts.

443
00:24:21,489 --> 00:24:23,423
No. We need secrets.

444
00:24:24,472 --> 00:24:27,024
We've got to get her to move
the money out of the pac.

445
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:28,149
Thank you.

446
00:24:28,394 --> 00:24:29,394
Right.

447
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,846
Tell me everything
you know about her.

448
00:24:32,363 --> 00:24:34,202
I've got some
really good stuff in here.

449
00:24:35,293 --> 00:24:36,995
She likes sugar in her coffee.

450
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,393
Lots of sugar.
And she hides tasty treats on her desk.

451
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,762
She's got a sweet tooth...
maybe we could use that.

452
00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:43,224
Probably not.
What else?

453
00:24:44,242 --> 00:24:45,858
She never takes calls
from her mother.

454
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:51,863
I got it. She mixes her blue pens
with her black pens in the same cup.

455
00:24:52,662 --> 00:24:54,033
Like mixes them together.

456
00:24:54,865 --> 00:24:57,995
Parker, I'm looking for something
that someone might find weird.

457
00:24:58,543 --> 00:24:59,705
Someone normal.

458
00:25:01,498 --> 00:25:03,084
Someone normal might find weird.

459
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:12,009
Thursday afternoon,

460
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,398
she had a closed-door meeting
with Blackwell, but...

461
00:25:14,696 --> 00:25:16,597
it sounded like
they were working out.

462
00:25:17,014 --> 00:25:17,974
"Working out"?

463
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:21,900
Hardison, do you still have
the audio file saved?

464
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:25,773
Yeah, but there's like 100 hours of it.
I haven't listened to it all yet.

465
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,930
No. Just pull up the files
from Thursday afternoon.

466
00:25:28,055 --> 00:25:30,278
- Between 3:26 and 4:15.
- <i>Okay. One second.</i>

467
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,411
Old people!

468
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:42,540
Parker, they're not working out.

469
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,084
They're... You know.

470
00:25:47,033 --> 00:25:49,005
Sex, Parker!
They're knocking boots.

471
00:25:51,863 --> 00:25:54,496
- Can you use that?
- With that...

472
00:25:55,658 --> 00:25:57,896
I can make her do anything I want.

473
00:25:59,957 --> 00:26:01,517
<i>This has been real cool,</i>

474
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,645
but I have to get back
to helping Eliot find the bomb.

475
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,109
I'm switching out oxygen meter.

476
00:26:17,153 --> 00:26:19,577
All right, man.
I've hacked into their monitoring system

477
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:23,748
to detects peaks in any heat to show us
where Clark planted the bomb.

478
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,499
- Where's it at?
- <i>No idea.</i>

479
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,100
This thing runs like an atari.

480
00:26:27,225 --> 00:26:29,599
It's great if you want to play "Frogger",
but to find a bomb?

481
00:26:29,724 --> 00:26:32,641
While you're playing video games,
I'm gonna still be looking for the bomb.

482
00:26:32,766 --> 00:26:34,648
If you decide to be helpful,
let me know.

483
00:26:44,831 --> 00:26:46,738
And thank you so much
for your contribution.

484
00:26:46,863 --> 00:26:48,108
Nice to meet you.

485
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:53,014
Ms. Pierce, I was hoping
to steal a minute of your time.

486
00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:54,697
I've heard so much about you.

487
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:57,031
- Of course, Ms...
- Tinson. Eloise Tinson.

488
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,635
Right.

489
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:00,534
The Coltan woman.

490
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:01,935
In the flesh.

491
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,793
I have to say, it's been such a delight
working with Danny.

492
00:27:05,729 --> 00:27:06,729
"Danny"?

493
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,418
- You mean Mr. Blackwell.
- Of course.

494
00:27:10,071 --> 00:27:13,188
The addition of this Coltan mine
is gonna do wonders for the state,

495
00:27:13,313 --> 00:27:16,610
and I wanted to thank you personally
for your contribution.

496
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,428
I'm sorry?
My contribution?

497
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,744
There's no need to be modest.
It's your money.

498
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:24,534
Or is it the pac money?
I never quite got that straight.

499
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,259
That's odd, because...

500
00:27:26,384 --> 00:27:29,775
yesterday he told me he was
using the mine funds for the purchase.

501
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,887
No. That's not
what he said last night.

502
00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:33,859
Or was it this morning?

503
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:36,737
Time got a bit blurred.

504
00:27:37,671 --> 00:27:40,351
Regardless, I'm pretty confident
he said he was using the pac money

505
00:27:40,476 --> 00:27:42,866
and that he was gonna make
the transfer today. So...

506
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:44,579
Thank you.

507
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,414
Thank you so much.

508
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:53,321
Great turnout.

509
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,550
Can I get you anything?

510
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:03,453
- What's wrong, Ms. Pierce?
- That thieving, cheating bastard!

511
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,441
You know, being down here
isn't such a good idea.

512
00:28:09,566 --> 00:28:12,239
I had the Coltan reports
looked at off-site,

513
00:28:12,364 --> 00:28:14,527
and I got to tell you,
the results were confusing.

514
00:28:15,718 --> 00:28:17,862
Maybe we could talk
about this aboveground.

515
00:28:19,804 --> 00:28:21,354
Section "C" is clear.

516
00:28:22,595 --> 00:28:24,827
Now, if you take a little bit
off the surface here,

517
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:26,119
Right?

518
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:30,583
It indicates the presence of Coltan.

519
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:32,111
Right?

520
00:28:32,524 --> 00:28:34,803
All right. Now I'm just gonna go
a little deeper here.

521
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:41,779
Nothing.

522
00:28:42,103 --> 00:28:45,848
- Those bastards salted my mine.
- They almost took your money, too.

523
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,226
Wait, wait.
I think I got something, man.

524
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,354
There are anomalies in the levels
in the northeast quadrant.

525
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:53,596
Speak english!

526
00:28:54,314 --> 00:28:55,858
Turn right.
Find bomb.

527
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,540
- He's here.
- <i>Who?</i>

528
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:04,050
- Cory.
- <i>Look, man.</i>

529
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:06,287
Unless that's a cute little name
you got for the bomb,

530
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:08,929
I'm compelled to remind you
of your mission. Find the bomb.

531
00:29:09,054 --> 00:29:10,623
Dismantle. Save lives.

532
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,045
I'm on it. All right?
Just stop talking!

533
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,797
I don't believe they tried
to pull one over on me.

534
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:20,677
Actually, I do believe
they did pull one over on you.

535
00:29:21,295 --> 00:29:23,497
That was me who figured out
what it was they were up to.

536
00:29:23,622 --> 00:29:26,310
I don't have time to discuss this.
We got to get the hell out of here.

537
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:03,801
You there?
Hello?

538
00:30:04,293 --> 00:30:06,053
Nate, are you there?

539
00:30:08,362 --> 00:30:09,223
I'm here.

540
00:30:10,136 --> 00:30:11,183
I've lost Nate.

541
00:30:12,303 --> 00:30:14,979
- What do you mean, you've lost Nate?
- I don't know. His comm is down.

542
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,523
- <i>You need to get down here.</i>
- Parker, meet me at the car now.

543
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:18,649
One second.

544
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,070
That takes care of that.

545
00:30:22,463 --> 00:30:25,407
I need you to get new keys
made for my office and call security.

546
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,409
I don't want Dan Blackwell
stepping foot in that building.

547
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:29,627
Yes, ma'am.

548
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:36,732
- Sounded like something collapsed.
- What you're doing down here?

549
00:30:36,857 --> 00:30:39,177
Figured now was a good time
to work on the machinery,

550
00:30:39,302 --> 00:30:41,630
- since no one's here.
- That's using your head.

551
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,467
You shouldn't be doing this alone.
Come on. We got to go.

552
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,135
Go!

553
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,640
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.

554
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,000
Explosion of some kind.

555
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:55,858
You got yourself a nice little
deathtrap here, don't you?

556
00:30:55,983 --> 00:30:59,204
We wouldn't be in this situation if
you hadn't insisted to drag us down here

557
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:01,454
for some science experiment.

558
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:04,601
You want to point fingers, or do you
want to you want to get us out of here?

559
00:31:04,726 --> 00:31:07,323
There's no way out!
Somebody's gonna have to find us!

560
00:31:08,191 --> 00:31:10,790
I don't like anybody
leaving my parties in such a hurry.

561
00:31:10,915 --> 00:31:13,120
There's been an accident at the mine.
Dan's trapped.

562
00:31:13,245 --> 00:31:15,777
- We have to get over there.
- Let the cheating bastard suffocate.

563
00:31:15,902 --> 00:31:18,042
I'm not letting either of you
steal my money.

564
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:22,963
- Nobody's trying to steal your money.
- I know when I'm being played.

565
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,107
I'm just gonna put this money
where no one can get to it.

566
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,519
Fine. It's just money.
We need to get over there.

567
00:31:28,644 --> 00:31:30,429
If I were you,
I'd worry about yourself.

568
00:31:30,793 --> 00:31:33,762
Someone as pretty as you is not
gonna do well in one of our prisons.

569
00:31:33,887 --> 00:31:36,685
Our women...
they don't take kindly to outsiders.

570
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,276
What do you mean by that?

571
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:41,555
I called the cops. They should
be here any minute to arrest you

572
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,401
on fraud, racketeering,
and impersonating a federal officer.

573
00:31:45,283 --> 00:31:46,695
You can't get me arrested.

574
00:31:47,684 --> 00:31:48,901
Sure, I can.

575
00:31:49,026 --> 00:31:51,309
It's one of the perks
of being Attorney General.

576
00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:52,535
I own the law.

577
00:31:52,971 --> 00:31:55,955
Debra, we're on the same side here.
Dan deceived us both.

578
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,041
You both deceived me.

579
00:31:59,356 --> 00:32:01,837
- Now, I am done being lied to.
- Ms. Pierce!

580
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:06,367
- I have a phone call for you.
- Not now. Not now!

581
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,626
Damn it.
Now look what you did!

582
00:32:14,395 --> 00:32:15,760
- <i>Sergeant Astin.</i>
- Sergeant.

583
00:32:15,885 --> 00:32:18,965
- <i>Yes, ma'am.</i>
- Meet me at the mine. Right away.

584
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,132
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

585
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,411
What are you doing in here?

586
00:32:32,462 --> 00:32:34,935
We left a couple of things and...

587
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:36,829
- The mine's closed.
- Right.

588
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:42,459
Go!

589
00:32:52,816 --> 00:32:54,377
How much oxygen we got?

590
00:32:55,025 --> 00:32:55,907
19%.

591
00:32:56,032 --> 00:32:58,716
19? It drops below 15, we're goners!

592
00:32:58,841 --> 00:33:00,237
Both of us in the room,

593
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:02,938
- we only got about two hours.
- You're right.

594
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,590
We only have two hours.

595
00:33:45,074 --> 00:33:48,460
Say, what about this intercom?
I mean, can't we...

596
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,085
You know,
call for help or something?

597
00:33:53,055 --> 00:33:55,335
No, you can't radio out.
It don't work.

598
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,686
- What do you mean?
- You got all that money.

599
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:01,163
I mean, you got new intercoms.
You got new ceiling supports.

600
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:04,792
You got new retrofit ventilation.
I mean, I saw the paperwork.

601
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,997
It's all fake.

602
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,088
Hold on there.
What do you mean, it's all fake?

603
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,512
The ceiling support and the ventilation
and the intercom... that's all fake.

604
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:16,749
The only safety measures
that that money bought...

605
00:34:17,292 --> 00:34:19,098
went to the Attorney General.

606
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:21,642
All the government money
went to her.

607
00:34:22,828 --> 00:34:23,831
Is that right?

608
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:25,562
Great investment.

609
00:34:26,727 --> 00:34:28,816
There's got to be
a way out of here, right?

610
00:34:32,055 --> 00:34:34,238
There might be
if we look down there!

611
00:34:40,943 --> 00:34:42,903
There's got to be a way
out of here, right?

612
00:34:44,767 --> 00:34:46,291
Look down there to your...

613
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,399
Clark!

614
00:35:10,636 --> 00:35:11,812
Mr. Blackwell!

615
00:35:11,937 --> 00:35:12,835
It's Eric!

616
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,092
Eric Randall!

617
00:35:14,426 --> 00:35:15,795
I'm almost through!

618
00:35:16,933 --> 00:35:19,070
- Can you squeeze?
- Yeah. Yeah, I can get through.

619
00:35:19,195 --> 00:35:22,576
- Are you okay, sir?
- I'm fine. Just get me out of here.

620
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,466
Mr. Blackwell!

621
00:35:26,953 --> 00:35:28,210
Stop right there.

622
00:35:29,162 --> 00:35:31,098
What the hell are you talking about?
Wait!

623
00:35:31,223 --> 00:35:32,655
You're under arrest!

624
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,476
Wait! No, wait a minute, now.
I'm the victim here.

625
00:35:36,071 --> 00:35:39,517
Mr. Gibson was responsible
for that explosion.

626
00:35:39,642 --> 00:35:42,723
He was trying to take my mine.
He planted that bomb.

627
00:35:43,177 --> 00:35:44,600
What do we have here?

628
00:35:45,457 --> 00:35:46,679
This bomb?

629
00:35:47,718 --> 00:35:50,439
All right, Eliot.
I think I got a lock on the bomb.

630
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,833
- I got it.
- What's it look like?

631
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:01,738
Red wires, blue wires? What?

632
00:36:06,908 --> 00:36:07,664
Boom!

633
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,710
You're not funny.

634
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:16,590
- Are you okay, sir?
- I'm fine. Just get me out of here.

635
00:36:20,586 --> 00:36:21,437
Look.

636
00:36:21,562 --> 00:36:24,139
What caused that explosion?
I was trapped in there.

637
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,640
Micro detonator,
surround sound, dust spray,

638
00:36:27,765 --> 00:36:30,128
modified oxygen meter, and...

639
00:36:30,574 --> 00:36:33,219
What? What? Yes, I do spend
my weekends making these things.

640
00:36:33,344 --> 00:36:35,818
Man, we're coming to a mine.
It's not rocket science.

641
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,384
I like it.
It gives him a whole village people,

642
00:36:38,509 --> 00:36:40,155
construction-dude thing.

643
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,657
- Thank you.
- Okay.

644
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,951
I'm gonna call Blackwell
and draw him here.

645
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:48,121
<i>It's a controlled blast. So as long
as you stay to the right of the "x,"</i>

646
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,874
<i>You should be fine.
I'll be controlling the oxygen meters.</i>

647
00:36:51,671 --> 00:36:54,526
I don't believe they tried
to pull one over on me.

648
00:36:54,982 --> 00:36:58,459
Actually, I believe they did,
in fact, pull one over on you.

649
00:37:02,021 --> 00:37:06,023
- Deb, what the hell is going on?
- They heard everything, you moron!

650
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:08,684
You're right.

651
00:37:09,086 --> 00:37:10,769
We only have two hours.

652
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,328
Nate, whatever you did, you just got
your comm back up, so listen.

653
00:37:15,453 --> 00:37:17,902
I've wired your comm
transmission to the PA system.

654
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,899
You get that confession,
and Eliot will come get you.

655
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:24,257
Say, what about this intercom?
I mean, can't we...

656
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:25,993
call for help or something?

657
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,127
- <i>It's all fake.</i>
- <i>What do you mean, it's all fake?</i>

658
00:37:31,197 --> 00:37:34,595
<i>Ceiling supports and the ventilators
And the intercoms... it's all fake.</i>

659
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,074
<i>The only safety measures that money
bought was the Attorney General.</i>

660
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:40,359
<i>All the government
money went to her.</i>

661
00:37:40,815 --> 00:37:41,815
Ma'am?

662
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,448
No, no. Wait, wait.
This is a mistake.

663
00:37:44,573 --> 00:37:46,221
There's nothing wrong here.

664
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,641
You think
you can get us out of this?

665
00:37:49,413 --> 00:37:52,811
I'm not getting you out of anything,
you cheating bastard!

666
00:37:57,845 --> 00:37:59,026
Just settle down.

667
00:38:00,724 --> 00:38:02,629
You settle down.
You settle down!

668
00:38:02,754 --> 00:38:04,823
You just can make a phone call.
They give you one...

669
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,519
No, I can't make a phone call!

670
00:38:06,644 --> 00:38:09,119
- They give you one.
- I can't make a phone call!

671
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:16,919
Nailed it.

672
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,718
A few of the guests
want to make a corporate donation.

673
00:38:19,843 --> 00:38:22,174
Should I direct them to
your political action committee account

674
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:24,801
- or the one I set up?
- The one you set up?

675
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,554
"Tomorrow's women."
Told you about it the other day.

676
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:30,349
Anyway you're authorized on that account
you can take money out any time.

677
00:38:30,923 --> 00:38:32,643
Can I transfer money in?

678
00:38:33,118 --> 00:38:33,977
Sure.

679
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,531
Here's the account number.

680
00:38:42,463 --> 00:38:43,779
That takes care of that.

681
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:49,493
Pierce transferred all the pac funds
into Parker's account.

682
00:38:49,862 --> 00:38:52,437
- Nicely done.
- I had a little help from Sophie.

683
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:55,791
But, yeah, I nailed it.
I'm a grifter.

684
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:58,135
I grift.

685
00:38:58,662 --> 00:39:00,879
You do know you don't get
to keep the money, right?

686
00:39:04,348 --> 00:39:05,548
Don't ruin it.

687
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:16,654
What are you doing?

688
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,381
Stealing souls is exhausting.

689
00:39:23,191 --> 00:39:25,237
Let's see.
Let's see. Let's see.

690
00:39:26,905 --> 00:39:28,907
"Right hand...
Answers phone, left.

691
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,564
"Blinks 15 times...

692
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,828
Smells like bubbles."

693
00:39:33,141 --> 00:39:36,164
Parker, you're not gonna start keeping
notepads like this about us, are you?

694
00:39:39,649 --> 00:39:42,754
Did you know you touch
your chin every 2.5 minutes?

695
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,050
Who are you?

696
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,670
Really.

697
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,605
We're friends of Troy.

698
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,754
We came here to make the mine safe.

699
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:06,445
So you're leaving?

700
00:40:07,814 --> 00:40:08,989
I'm leaving.

701
00:40:09,912 --> 00:40:13,003
But you got a bunch of good ol'boys
here to watch your back for you.

702
00:40:14,047 --> 00:40:16,747
You remember what I told you.
Use that head.

703
00:40:18,175 --> 00:40:19,621
Keep you safe.

704
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:21,871
- I will.
- Good.

705
00:40:22,672 --> 00:40:25,226
That way, I don't have to come back here
and whip your ass.

706
00:40:32,726 --> 00:40:33,726
All right.

707
00:40:48,204 --> 00:40:50,447
Hey, there.
Welcome to your new office.

708
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,379
- Excuse me?
- After Blackwell was arrested,

709
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:57,008
the board removed him as CEO
and made you mine supervisor.

710
00:40:57,758 --> 00:40:59,581
Now everybody's safety
is in your hands.

711
00:41:01,467 --> 00:41:02,709
I'll do my best.

712
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,869
Well, here.
This here should help.

713
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:11,575
- Where did this come from?
- That is the federal safety money.

714
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,065
See, what happens
was Blackwell gave it to Pierce,

715
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,348
and Pierce gave it to us, and...

716
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:17,666
More or less.

717
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:22,354
Now you can buy safety equipment
that actually works.

718
00:41:24,287 --> 00:41:27,901
- Thank you so much.
- All right. We'll let you get to it.

719
00:41:29,194 --> 00:41:31,120
- Thank you.
- Listen, do me a favor.

720
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:33,771
Watch out for Cory for me.

721
00:41:33,896 --> 00:41:35,302
- Will do.
- All right.

722
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,609
You should put him on the scoop.

723
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:40,590
He's got a knack for it.

724
00:41:54,636 --> 00:41:56,815
<i>B-shift descending in five minutes.</i>
